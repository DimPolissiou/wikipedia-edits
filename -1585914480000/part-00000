{"title_page": "International Conference on Population and Development", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2017}}\nThe United Nations coordinated an '''International Conference on Population and Development''' (ICPD) in [[Cairo]], Egypt, on 5\u201313 September 1994. Its resulting Programme of Action is the steering document for the [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA).\n\nSome 20,000 delegates from various governments, UN agencies, NGOs, and the media gathered for a discussion of a variety of population issues, including immigration, [[infant mortality]], [[birth control]], [[family planning]], the [[female education|education of women]], and protection for women from unsafe abortion services.\n\nThe conference received considerable media attention due to disputes regarding the assertion of [[reproductive rights]]. The [[Holy See]] and several predominantly [[Islam]]ic nations were staunch critics, and U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] received considerable criticism from [[Conservatism|conservatives]] for his participation, considering the fact that president [[Ronald Reagan]] did not attend or fund the previous conference held in Mexico City in 1984. The official spokesman for the Holy See was archbishop [[Renato Martino]].\n\nAccording to the official ICPD release, the conference delegates achieved consensus on the following four qualitative and quantitative goals:<ref>[http://www.unfpa.org/public/site/global/publications/pid/1973 \"Report of the International Conference on Population and Development\"], [[UNFPA]], 1995</ref>\n#'''Universal education''': Universal primary education in all countries by 2015. Urge countries to provide wider access to women for secondary and higher level education as well as vocational and technical training.\n#'''Reduction of infant and [[child mortality]]''': Countries should strive to reduce infant and under-5 child mortality rates by one-third or to 50\u201370 deaths per 1000 by the year 2000. By 2015 all countries should aim to achieve a rate below 35 per 1,000 live births and under-five mortality rate below 45 per 1,000. \t\n#'''Reduction of [[maternal mortality]]''': A reduction by {{sfrac|1|2}} the 1990 levels by 2000 and {{sfrac|1|2}} of that by 2015. Disparities in maternal mortality within countries and between geographical regions, socio-economic and ethnic groups should be narrowed. \t\n#'''Access to reproductive and sexual health services including family planning''': Family-planning counseling, pre-natal care, safe delivery and post-natal care, prevention and appropriate treatment of infertility, prevention of abortion and the management of the consequences of abortion, treatment of reproductive tract infections, sexually transmitted diseases and other reproductive health conditions; and education, counseling, as appropriate, on human sexuality, reproductive health and responsible parenthood. Services regarding HIV/AIDS, breast cancer, infertility, and delivery should be made available. Active discouragement of [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM).\n\n==History==\nSee [[World Population Conferences]]\n\nThe first [[World Population Conference]], organised by the [[League of Nations]] and [[Margaret Sanger]], had been held at the Salle Central in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] from 29 August to 3 September 1927.\n\nThe first World Population Conference sponsored by the [[United Nations]] was held in 1954 in [[Rome]], a second in 1965 in [[Belgrade]], a third in 1974 in [[Bucharest]], a fourth in 1984 in [[Mexico City]].\n\n==ICPD and abortion==\nDuring and after the ICPD, some interested parties attempted to interpret the term 'reproductive health' in the sense that it implies abortion as a means of family planning or, indeed, a right to abortion. These interpretations, however, do not reflect the consensus reached at the Conference. \nFor the European Union, where legislation on abortion is less restrictive than elsewhere, the Council Presidency has clearly stated that the Council's commitment to promote 'reproductive health' did not include the promotion of abortion.<ref>European Parliament, 4 December 2003: Oral Question (H-0794/03) for Question Time at the part-session in December 2003 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Dana Scallon to the Council. In the written record of that session, one reads: Posselt (PPE-DE): \u201cDoes the term 'reproductive health' include the promotion of abortion, yes or no?\u201d \u2013 Antonione, Council: \u201cNo.\u201d</ref>  Likewise, the European Commission, in response to a question from a Member of the European Parliament, clarified:\n\n\"The term 'reproductive health' was defined by the United Nations (UN) in 1994 at the Cairo International Conference on Population and Development. All Member States of the Union endorsed the Programme of Action adopted at Cairo. The Union has never adopted an alternative definition of 'reproductive health' to that given in the Programme of Action, which makes no reference to abortion.\"<ref>European Parliament, 24 October 2002: Question no 86 by Dana Scallon (H-0670/02)</ref>\n  \nWith regard to the US, only a few days prior to the Cairo Conference, the head of the US delegation, Vice President [[Al Gore]], had stated for the record:\n \n\"Let us get a false issue off the table: the US does not seek to establish a new international right to abortion, and we do not believe that abortion should be encouraged as a method of family planning.\"<ref>Jyoti Shankar Singh, Creating a New Consensus on Population (London: Earthscan, 1998), 60</ref>\n \nSome years later, the position of the US Administration in this debate was reconfirmed by US Ambassador to the UN, [[Ellen Sauerbrey]], when she stated at a meeting of the UN Commission on the Status of Women that: \n\"nongovernmental organizations are attempting to assert that Beijing in some way creates or contributes to the creation of an internationally recognized fundamental right to abortion\".<ref>Lederer, AP/San Francisco Chronicle, 1 March 2005</ref> She added: \"There is no fundamental right to abortion.

By 2015 all countries should aim to achieve a rate below 35 per 1,000 live births and under-five mortality rate below 45 per 1,000. \t\n#'''Reduction of [[maternal mortality]]''': A reduction by {{sfrac|1|2}} the 1990 levels by 2000 and {{sfrac|1|2}} of that by 2015. Disparities in maternal mortality within countries and between geographical regions, socio-economic and ethnic groups should be narrowed. \t\n#'''Access to reproductive and sexual health services including family planning''': Family-planning counseling, pre-natal care, safe delivery and post-natal care, prevention and appropriate treatment of infertility, prevention of abortion and the management of the consequences of abortion, treatment of reproductive tract infections, sexually transmitted diseases and other reproductive health conditions; and education, counseling, as appropriate, on human sexuality, reproductive health and responsible parenthood. Services regarding HIV/AIDS, breast cancer, infertility, and delivery should be made available. Active discouragement of [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM).\n\n==History==\nSee [[World Population Conferences]]\n\nThe first [[World Population Conference]], organised by the [[League of Nations]] and [[Margaret Sanger]], had been held at the Salle Central in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] from 29 August to 3 September 1927.\n\nThe first World Population Conference sponsored by the [[United Nations]] was held in 1954 in [[Rome]], a second in 1965 in [[Belgrade]], a third in 1974 in [[Bucharest]], a fourth in 1984 in [[Mexico City]].\n\n==ICPD and abortion==\nDuring and after the ICPD, some interested parties attempted to interpret the term 'reproductive health' in the sense that it implies abortion as a means of family planning or, indeed, a right to abortion. These interpretations, however, do not reflect the consensus reached at the Conference. \nFor the European Union, where legislation on abortion is less restrictive than elsewhere, the Council Presidency has clearly stated that the Council's commitment to promote 'reproductive health' did not include the promotion of abortion.<ref>European Parliament, 4 December 2003: Oral Question (H-0794/03) for Question Time at the part-session in December 2003 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Dana Scallon to the Council. In the written record of that session, one reads: Posselt (PPE-DE): \u201cDoes the term 'reproductive health' include the promotion of abortion, yes or no?\u201d \u2013 Antonione, Council: \u201cNo.\u201d</ref>  Likewise, the European Commission, in response to a question from a Member of the European Parliament, clarified:\n\n\"The term 'reproductive health' was defined by the United Nations (UN) in 1994 at the Cairo International Conference on Population and Development. All Member States of the Union endorsed the Programme of Action adopted at Cairo. The Union has never adopted an alternative definition of 'reproductive health' to that given in the Programme of Action, which makes no reference to abortion.\"<ref>European Parliament, 24 October 2002: Question no 86 by Dana Scallon (H-0670/02)</ref>\n  \nWith regard to the US, only a few days prior to the Cairo Conference, the head of the US delegation, Vice President [[Al Gore]], had stated for the record:\n \n\"Let us get a false issue off the table: the US does not seek to establish a new international right to abortion, and we do not believe that abortion should be encouraged as a method of family planning.\"<ref>Jyoti Shankar Singh, Creating a New Consensus on Population (London: Earthscan, 1998), 60</ref>\n \nSome years later, the position of the US Administration in this debate was reconfirmed by US Ambassador to the UN, [[Ellen Sauerbrey]], when she stated at a meeting of the UN Commission on the Status of Women that: \n\"nongovernmental organizations are attempting to assert that Beijing in some way creates or contributes to the creation of an internationally recognized fundamental right to abortion\".<ref>Lederer, AP/San Francisco Chronicle, 1 March 2005</ref> She added: \"There is no fundamental right to abortion. And yet it keeps coming up largely driven by NGOs trying to hijack the term and trying to make it into a definition\".<ref>Leopold, Reuters, 28 February 2005</ref>\n\n==Participants==\n* [[National Black Women\u2019s Reproductive Justice Agenda]] (1994)<ref>http://blackrj.wpengine.com/about-us/herstory/</ref>\n\n== Nairobi Summit on ICPD25 ==\nThe 2019 [[Nairobi]] Summit on ICPD25 will be held in [[Nairobi]] in November.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nairobisummiticpd.org/|title=Nairobi Summit on ICPD25|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> It marks the 25th year of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD).

The school's specialist status as a Business and Enterprise school has opened a wider range of business-oriented subjects within the school, including [[Business Studies]] (at GCSE, A-level and BTEC level 2 & 3), [[Accounting]], Law and [[Economics]]. Many subjects are also encouraged to relate aspects of their teaching to business life. The schools' specialist status is confirmed until 2010.<ref>The school obtained its status in 2004, and the status lasts for 4 years before renewal.

Traditionally, 2 Christmas concerts are held in early December, combining solo performances with ensemble items such as the school orchestra, swing band, and the traditional singing of carols by Year 7 students. Other ensembles include the Junior Wind band for younger students, and smaller groups such as the flute group and the clarinet group. The school also has a similar Easter Concert, and a musical is held nearer the end of the school year. In recent years, Shenfield has performed ''Joseph'', ''Bugsy Malone'', ''Back to The 80's'', ''The Music Man'', ''The Wizard of Oz'', ''The Four Seasons Of Wounded Knee'', ''[[High School Musical]]'' and ''We Will Rock You''.\n\n==Academic==\nShenfield High School was rated as \"Good\" (Level 2) overall by [[OFSTED]], when the previous inspection happened on 11 November and 12 November 2014.

Speaking on Radio 4 in March 2010, the headteacher John Fairhurst was extremely critical of the Ofsted inspection which he claimed was too short in duration and insufficient in depth to reach the conclusions made in the report. The school's specialist status as a Business and Enterprise school has opened a wider range of business-oriented subjects within the school, including [[Business Studies]] (at GCSE, A-level and BTEC level 2 & 3), [[Accounting]], Law and [[Economics]]. Many subjects are also encouraged to relate aspects of their teaching to business life. The schools' specialist status is confirmed until 2010.<ref>The school obtained its status in 2004, and the status lasts for 4 years before renewal.

Sighi\u0219oara became one of the most important cities of Transylvania, with artisans from throughout the [[Holy Roman Empire]] visiting the settlement. The German artisans and craftsmen dominated the urban economy, as well as building the fortifications protecting it. It is estimated that during the 16th and 17th centuries Sighi\u0219oara had as many as 15 [[guild]]s and 20 [[handicraft]] branches. The [[Baroque]] sculptor Elias Nicolai lived in the city. The [[Wallachia]]n ''[[voivode]]'' [[Vlad Dracul]] (father of [[Vlad III the Impaler|Vlad the Impaler (Dracula)]]), who lived in exile in the town, had coins minted in the city (otherwise coinage was the monopoly of the [[Hungarian kings]] in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]) and issued the first document listing the city's [[Romanian language|Romanian]] name, ''Sighi\u0219oara''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} The Romanian name is first attested in 1435, and derives from the Hungarian ''Segesv\u00e1r'', where ''v\u00e1r'' is \"fort\".<ref name=\"room\"/><ref name=\"talanga\"/>\n[[File:Old picture of Piata Hermann Oberth .jpg|left|thumb|252x252px|Pia\u021ba Hermann Oberth during the 20th century]]\nThe city was the setting for [[George I R\u00e1k\u00f3czi]]'s election as [[List of Transylvanian rulers|Prince of Transylvania]] and [[King of Hungary]] in 1631.

A monument was constructed in 1852 to the Russian general Skariatin, who died in the battle. The Hungarian poet [[S\u00e1ndor Pet\u0151fi]] is generally believed to have been killed in the battle, and a monument was constructed in his honor at Albe\u0219ti in 1897.

The town is made up of two parts. The medieval stronghold was built on top of a hill and is known as the \"Citadel\" (Cetate). The lower town lies in the valley of T\u00e2rnava Mare river.\n\nThe houses inside Sighi\u0219oara Citadel show the main features of a craftsmen's town.
