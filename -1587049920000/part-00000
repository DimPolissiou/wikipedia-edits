[[International Standard Book Number|ISBN]] [[Special:BookSources/9780813941394|<bdi>9780813941394</bdi>]].</ref>\n== Plot ==\n[[File:Port au prince-haiti.JPG|left|thumb|237x237px|Port-au-Prince, the capital of Haiti, where portions of D\u00e9zafi are set. ]]\n''D\u00e9zafi'' mostly takes place in the rural Haitian village of Bouan\u00e8f but there are some scenes in [[Port-au-Prince]]. The core storyline focuses on a plantation owned by Sintil, the local oungan (vodou priest), and run by zonbis. The zonbis, humans brought back to life from a death-like state by an oungan to work, are essentially slaves. They cannot speak, cannot think, and have no more cognitive function than is required to work the plantation. \n\nSintil controls the zonbis with the help of his daughter Siltana and a hired man named Zof\u00e8. Sintil frequently reminds Siltana that she must remember to never give the zonbis salt because if they taste it they will wake up. At the beginning of the book Siltana is happy to follow her father's directives. However when a new zonbi named Klodonis is brought to the plantation she falls in love with him and loses interest in her normal duties on the ranch. She is devastated by the fact that Klodonis is in a permanent stupor and cannot reciprocate her feelings. Her frustration buillds throughout the book until at last in desperation she gives Klodonis salt and restores him to being fully human. Unfortunately, far from being in love with her, Klodonis knocks her to the ground and immediately revives the rest of the zonbis, launching a rebellion against Sintil which eventually spreads to the village and culminates in Sintil's bloody demise.\n\nThe majority of the main plotline happens in the very end of the book. There are, however, several smaller plotlines sprinkled throughout ''D\u00e9zafi,'' which focus on other villagers in Bouan\u00e8f and how their lives are affected by Sintil\u2019s presence. J\u00e9r\u00f2m, for example, is a villager who hides in his brother\u2019s attic for almost the entirety of the book out of fear of Sintil. Another character, Gaston, uses his winnings from a lucky day at gambling to travel to Port-au-Prince. Unfortunately, once there he cannot earn enough money to make a stable living and languishes on the streets for years before attempting to return to Bouan\u00e8f just as the revolution is taking place. However when he sees the chaotic revolution occurring in the village he turns around and walks back towards Port-au-Prince. Still another villager, J\u00e9d\u00e9yon, lives alone in an old house with his niece Rita. J\u00e9d\u00e9yon has been abandoned by his wife and family who left for the United States without him and he constantly berates and chastises Rita, who takes care of him and the house. He dies before the rebellion.\n\nThere is an additional abstract plotline which centers on a series of cock fight (d\u00e9zafis, in Haitian). When Sintil is at last apprehended and killed it is at one of these cock fights. \n\n== Structure ==\n[[File:Franketienne Painting.jpg|thumb|318x318px|An untitled spiralist painting by Frank\u00e9tienne. |alt=]]\nDue to its spiralist influences, ''D\u00e9zafi'' is unconventional in structure and formatting. It follows a spiral-like structure, in which the narrative bends back to where it began with multiple repetitions and reiterations of points and details.<ref name=\":4\" /> The main story progresses on and up, building to the climax with numerous other voices and perspectives included to build the sense that the whole narrative reality is collective and exists both objectively and subjectively.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThe original 1975 includes three types of text: italics, bold with forward slashes, and indented standard roman type. These three different formats are interwoven throughout the text, such that a single page might have portions of each.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe standard roman type is used predominantly for the plot and concrete experiences of the characters, but it accounts for less than half of the text of ''D\u00e9zafi''. The rest is written in either italics or bold and does not relate directly to the plotline of the book, but rather has a more poetic and abstract significance with regards to [[Culture of Haiti|Haitian culture]]. Frequently these sections are related to the titular d\u00e9zafi (cock fight) and they are often narrated in first person plural.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the later 2002 edition of the book many more font sizes and typefaces were added beyond the original three, n addition to other changes relating to spelling and formatting.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n== Political Message ==\nIn ''D\u00e9zafi'' Sintil and his cronies are a veiled allegory for the [[Duvalier dynasty|Duvalier regime]] which ruled Haiti at the time when D\u00e9zafi was written.<ref name=\":5\">McFee, Mollie (2017). \"Beyond Translation: The Matrice of Frank\u00e9tienne's Dezafi\".

And as Sintil was only overthrown once the ''zonbis'' had their humanity restored, Frank\u00e9tienne implies that an uprising can only take place once the people of Haiti awaken from their subservient stupor.<ref name=\":5\" /> \n\nUnfortunately, at the time of ''D\u00e9zafi''<nowiki/>'s publication much of Haiti was illiterate and thus could not access Frank\u00e9tienne\u2019s message. Only 20% of Haitians could read, and many of that number were against the idea of writing in Creole, preferring French.<ref name=\":5\" /> Therefore, the general public of Haiti was not able to read ''D\u00e9zafi'' and Frank\u00e9tienne's attempt to call the people to revolt against the Duvalier regime fell on deaf ears. For this reason he later switched to writing plays, which the ordinary citizen could access.

[[International Standard Book Number|ISBN]] [[Special:BookSources/9780813941394|<bdi>9780813941394</bdi>]].</ref>\n== Plot ==\n[[File:Port au prince-haiti.JPG|left|thumb|237x237px|Port-au-Prince, the capital of Haiti, where portions of D\u00e9zafi are set. ]]\n''D\u00e9zafi'' mostly takes place in the rural Haitian village of Bouan\u00e8f but there are some scenes in [[Port-au-Prince]]. The core storyline focuses on a plantation owned by Sintil, the local oungan (vodou priest), and run by zonbis. The zonbis, humans brought back to life from a death-like state by an oungan to work, are essentially slaves. They cannot speak, cannot think, and have no more cognitive function than is required to work the plantation. \n\nSintil controls the zonbis with the help of his daughter Siltana and a hired man named Zof\u00e8. Sintil frequently reminds Siltana that she must remember to never give the zonbis salt because if they taste it they will wake up. At the beginning of the book Siltana is happy to follow her father's directives. However when a new zonbi named Klodonis is brought to the plantation she falls in love with him and loses interest in her normal duties on the ranch. She is devastated by the fact that Klodonis is in a permanent stupor and cannot reciprocate her feelings. Her frustration buillds throughout the book until at last in desperation she gives Klodonis salt and restores him to being fully human. Unfortunately, far from being in love with her, Klodonis knocks her to the ground and immediately revives the rest of the zonbis, launching a rebellion against Sintil which eventually spreads to the village and culminates in Sintil's bloody demise.\n\nThe majority of the main plotline happens in the very end of the book. There are, however, several smaller plotlines sprinkled throughout ''D\u00e9zafi,'' which focus on other villagers in Bouan\u00e8f and how their lives are affected by Sintil\u2019s presence. J\u00e9r\u00f2m, for example, is a villager who hides in his brother\u2019s attic for almost the entirety of the book out of fear of Sintil. Another character, Gaston, uses his winnings from a lucky day at gambling to travel to Port-au-Prince. Unfortunately, once there he cannot earn enough money to make a stable living and languishes on the streets for years before attempting to return to Bouan\u00e8f just as the the revolution is taking place. However when he sees the chaotic revolution occurring in the village he turns around and walks back towards Port-au-Prince. Still another villager, J\u00e9d\u00e9yon, lives alone in an old house with his niece Rita. J\u00e9d\u00e9yon has been abandoned by his wife and family who left for the United States without him and he constantly berates and chastises Rita, who takes care of him and the house. He dies before the rebellion.\n\nThere is an additional abstract plotline which centers on a series of cock fight (d\u00e9zafis, in Haitian). When Sintil is at last apprehended and killed it is at one of these cock fights. \n\n== Structure ==\n[[File:Franketienne Painting.jpg|thumb|318x318px|An untitled spiralist painting by Frank\u00e9tienne. |alt=]]\nDue to its spiralist influences, ''D\u00e9zafi'' is unconventional in structure and formatting. It follows a spiral-like structure, in which the narrative bends back to where it began with multiple repetitions and reiterations of points and details.<ref name=\":4\" /> The main story progresses on and up, building to the climax with numerous other voices and perspectives included to build the sense that the whole narrative reality is collective and exists both objectively and subjectively.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThe original 1975 includes three types of text: italics, bold with forward slashes, and indented standard roman type. These three different formats are interwoven throughout the text, such that a single page might have portions of each.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe standard roman type is used predominantly for the plot and concrete experiences of the characters, but it accounts for less than half of the text of ''D\u00e9zafi''. The rest is written in either italics or bold and does not relate directly to the plotline of the book, but rather has a more poetic and abstract significance with regards to [[Culture of Haiti|Haitian culture]]. Frequently these sections are related to the titular d\u00e9zafi (cock fight) and they are often narrated in first person plural.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the later 2002 edition of the book many more font sizes and typefaces were added beyond the original three, n addition to other changes relating to spelling and formatting.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n== Political Message ==\nIn ''D\u00e9zafi'' Sintil and his cronies are a veiled allegory for the [[Duvalier dynasty|Duvalier regime]] which ruled Haiti at the time when D\u00e9zafi was written.<ref name=\":5\">McFee, Mollie (2017). \"Beyond Translation: The Matrice of Frank\u00e9tienne's Dezafi\".

[[International Standard Serial Number|ISSN]]&nbsp;0010-4132.</ref> The zonbis in ''D\u00e9zafi'' are meant to represent Haitians living under the Duvalier regime.<ref name=\":5\" /> Frank\u00e9tienne was hinting that the Duvalier regime could be overturned through an uprising of the populace of Haiti, just as Sintil was only overthrown when the zonbis finally woke up and exacted their vengeance. And as Sintil was only overthrown once the ''zonbis'' had their humanity restored, Frank\u00e9tienne implies that an uprising can only take place once the people of Haiti awaken from their subservient stupor.<ref name=\":5\" /> \n\nUnfortunately, at the time of ''D\u00e9zafi''<nowiki/>'s publication much of Haiti was illiterate and thus could not access Frank\u00e9tienne\u2019s message. Only 20% of Haitians could read, and many of that number were against the idea of writing in Creole, preferring French.<ref name=\":5\" /> Therefore, the general public of Haiti was not able to read ''D\u00e9zafi'' and Frank\u00e9tienne's attempt to call the people to revolt against the Duvalier regime fell on deaf ears. For this reason he later switched to writing plays, which the ordinary citizen could access.

On Ground 2, the \u2018implied repeal ground\u2019 the ERO was repealed by implication by the [[Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance]] and/or the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) as applied in Hong Kong by the Basic Law. On Ground 3, the ERO cannot empower the Chief Executive to make any regulation restricting fundamental rights under the Basic Law or Bill of Rights. On Ground 4, the \u2018principle of legality ground\u2019, the Chief Executive acted ''ultra vires'' in that the ERO only applies to emergency situations. On Ground 5A, the \u2019section 3 proportionality ground\u2019, section 3 of the PFCR, which prohibits the use of facial coverings, disproportionately restricts privacy, and freedom of expression and assembly; on Ground 5B, the \u2018section 5 proportionality ground\u2019, section 5, concerning enforcement powers, is also disproportionate.\n\n==== Ground 1: the delegation of legislative power ground ====\n\nThe applicants submitted that under the Basic Law, legislative power is exclusively vested in the Legislative Council; since the ERO would grant legislative power to the executive, it is inconsistent with the Basic Law.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=35}}</ref> The government submitted that there is \u2018nothing in the Basic Law which provides whether expressly or by implication that the LegCo cannot authorise the CEIC [Chief Executive in Council] to make regulations during an occasion of public danger or emergency\u2019, that the ERO had already twice been held to be valid, that regulations made thereunder were not intended to be permanent, and that the LegCo could apply negative vetting to such regulations.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=36}}</ref>\n\nThe court declined to rule on the question of the constitutionality of the making of regulations by the Chief Executive in Council on an occasion of an emergency, and solely considered that concerning public danger.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=37}}</ref> The court accepted that there was a distinction between \u2018general legislative power\u2019 and the power to make \u2018subordinate legislation\u2019.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=53}}</ref> It drew such a distinction on the basis that the LegCo is \u2018designated as ''the'' legislature\u2019{{efn|Emphasis the court\u2019s.}} and that in the Chinese text of the Basic Law gives the LegCo \u2018''functions'' which in Chinese is \u201c\u8077\u201d in the phrase \u201c\u8077\u6b0a\u201d\u2019, which \u2018connotes\u2026[a] \u2019job\u2019\u201d.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=52}}</ref> The court then determined that the character of the powers granted by the ERO was more akin to that of a general legislative power than a subsidiary one, for several reasons.

On Ground 2, the \u2018implied repeal ground\u2019 the ERO was repealed by implication by the [[Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance]] and/or the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) as applied in Hong Kong by the Basic Law. On Ground 3, the ERO cannot empower the Chief Executive to make any regulation restricting fundamental rights under the Basic Law or Bill of Rights. On Ground 4, the \u2018principle of legality ground\u2019, the Chief Executive acted ''ultra vires'' in that the ERO only applies to emergency situations. On Ground 5A, the \u2019section 3 proportionality ground\u2019, section 3 of the PFCR, which prohibits the use of facial coverings, disproportionately restricts privacy, and freedom of expression and assembly; on Ground 5B, the \u2018section 5 proportionality ground\u2019, section 5, concerning enforcement powers, is also disproportionate.\n\n==== Ground 1: the delegation of legislative power ground ====\n\nThe applicants submitted that under the Basic Law, legislative power is exclusively vested in the Legislative Council; since the ERO would grant legislative power to the executive, it is inconsistent with the Basic Law.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=35}}</ref> The government submitted that there is \u2018nothing in the Basic Law which provides whether expressly or by implication that the LegCo cannot authorise the CEIC [Chief Executive in Council] to make regulations during an occasion of public danger or emergency\u2019, that the ERO had already twice been held to be valid, that regulations made thereunder were not intended to be permanent, and that the LegCo could apply negative vetting to such regulations.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=36}}</ref>\n\nThe court declined to rule on the question of the constitutionality of the making of regulations by the Chief Executive in Council on an occasion of an emergency, and solely considered that concerning public danger.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=37}}</ref> The court accepted that there was a distinction between \u2018general legislative power\u2019 and the power to make \u2018subordinate legislation\u2019.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=53}}</ref> It drew such a distinction on the basis that the LegCo is \u2018designated as ''the'' legislature\u2019{{efn|Emphasis the court\u2019s.}} and that in the Chinese text of the Basic Law gives the LegCo \u2018''functions'' which in Chinese is \u201c\u8077\u201d in the phrase \u201c\u8077\u6b0a\u201d\u2019, which \u2018connotes\u2026[a] \u2019job\u2019\u201d.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=52}}</ref> The court then determined that the character of the powers granted by the ERO was more akin to that of a general legislative power than a subsidiary one, for several reasons. First, the powers granted by the ERO seemed not so much to \u2019leav[e] another body to devise the detailed legal norms that elaborate or put flesh on the broad matters laid down in the primary legislation\u2019 so much as to allow general legislation\u2014thus this very regulation was the first enactment to concern face covering in Hong Kong.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=56}}</ref> Second, the phrase \u2018any regulations whatsoever\u2019 grants powers \u2018of the widest possible nature\u2019.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=57}}</ref> Third, \u2018public danger\u2019 is inadequately defined.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=60}}</ref> Fourth, the ERO grants the Chief Executive power to amend or suspend any other enactment.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=63}}</ref> Fifth, the ERO permits the Chief Executive to prescribe punishments up to life imprisonment, ''inter alia'', which exceed those envisaged by the Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance (Cap. 1) vis \u00e0 vis subsidiary legislation.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong ordinance|1|28|1|e}}</ref> Sixth, no time limit is envisaged by the ERO.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=68}}</ref> Seventh, negative vetting is an inadequate safeguard given, ''inter alia'', that its operation could be suspended by a regulation under the ERO, and that the legal effects of its application before repeal by the Legislative Council would not be undone even if negative vetting were possible.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=74}}</ref> \n\nOn the fourth ground, the government submitted that such clauses are entirely permissible in other common law jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom and Australia;<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=65}}</ref> however, the court rejected the applicability of such a Diceyan notion of absolute parliamentary sovereignty in Hong Kong, on the basis that the Legislative Council\u2019s powers are derived from the Basic Law.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=66}}</ref> Ultimately the court concluded that the ERO in allowing for the making of regulations by the Chief Executive at a time of \u2018public danger\u2019 did so sufficiently broadly that it \u2018seems\u2026to create in Hong Kong a separate source of laws that are primary legislation in all but name\u2019.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=80}}</ref>\n\nThe government further submitted that the ERO had been vetted for constitutionality before the handover as a \u2018factor in favour of validity\u2019;
