UN troops arrested 79 foreign mercenaries and officers employed by Katanga with little conflict.\n\n== Background ==\n=== Katanga's secession ===\n{{main|Congo Crisis}}\nThe [[Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville)|Republic of the Congo]] became independent from [[Belgium]] on 30 June 1960. On 5 July, disgruntled soldiers of the [[Force Publique]], unhappy with their lack of advancement relative to civilian politicians, began [[1960 Force Publique mutiny|a nationwide mutiny]] against their white officers. The rebellions caused widespread instability and led to the flight of much of the Congo's European population, which was of vital importance to the economy. On July 9 the mutinies spread to the southern province of [[Katanga Province|Katanga]].{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=44}} Katanga contained the vast majority of the Congo's valuable mineral resources and had attracted significant mining activity under Belgian rule.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=31}} Many Katangese thought that they were entitled to the revenue generated through the lucrative industry, and feared that under the new central government led by Prime Minister [[Patrice Lumumba]] it would be redistributed among the Congo's poorer provinces.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=40}}\n\nThe remaining settlers in Katanga, the Belgian government, and members of the [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] [[Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration des associations tribales du Katanga]] (CONAKAT), the ruling party in the Katangese provincial government, blamed Lumumba and his alleged communist sympathies for the collapse in order. With Lumumba refusing to accept the direct intervention of Belgian troops, elements of the Belgian government began pushing for the creation of a separate Katangese state through which European mining interests could be protected.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=44}} On 11 July Belgian metropolitan units were landed across the Congo, without the Congolese government's consent, to disarm the mutinous troops.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=97}} That evening [[Mo\u00efse Tshombe]], President of Katanga Province, citing the collapse of order in the Congo and the threat of a communist takeover, declared the independence of the \"[[State of Katanga]]\" and appealed for Belgian assistance.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=99}} On 12 July Lumumba and President [[Joseph Kasa-Vubu]] appealed to the [[United Nations]] (UN), requesting that international troops be dispatched to the Congo to replace the Belgian forces and reestablish order.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=114}} The [[UN Security Council]] complied, passing several resolutions calling for the withdrawal of Belgian troops and establishing a large multinational peacekeeping mission, the [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]] (known by its French acronym, ONUC).{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=46}}\n\nLumumba demanded that ONUC troops be used to forcibly put down the Katangese secession. The Security Council resolved on 9 August that \"the entry of the United Nations Force into the province of Katanga is necessary for the full implementation of this resolution\" while also deciding that \"the United Nations Force in the Congo will not be a party to or in any way intervene in or be used to influence the outcome of any internal conflict.\" The mobilisation of a Katangese army, dubbed the Katangese Gendarmerie, troubled [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Secretary-General]] [[Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld]], who felt that an armed confrontation would violate ONUC's mandate. Frustrated, Lumumba appealed to [[Eastern Bloc]] nations for military assistance, resulting in a conflict with Kasa-Vubu and ultimately his removal from power in September and eventual murder in January 1961.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|pp=45\u201346}}\n\n=== Katangese forces ===\nImmediately following the declaration of secession, the Katangese government worked to quickly establish its own armed force. Belgian officers and Katangese rank-and-file of the Force Publique formed the nucleus of the new Katangese Gendarmerie, bolstered by the recruitment of tribal warriors. By 26 November 1960 the force consisted of about 7,000 men, though there existed a deficit in training and qualified leadership. This was partly resolved by the loaning of Belgian Army officers from the Belgian government and the institution of several training programs in the metropole for their use.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|pp=47\u201348}}{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=384}} By March 1961 the gendarmerie was composed of 600 European and 8,000 indigenous soldiers.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=49}}\n\n=== Escalation of UN\u2013Katangese tension ===\nThe announcement of Lumumba's death created a sense of urgency among the international community and motivated members of the UN Security Council to strengthen ONUC's powers.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=328}} On 21 February 1961 the [[UN Security Council]] passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 161|a resolution]] permitting ONUC to use military force as a last resort to prevent civil war. As the Congo was already more-or-less in a state of civil war, the resolution gave ONUC significant latitude to act. It also called for the immediate departure of all foreign military personnel and mercenaries from the country, though the use of force was not authorised to carry out the measure. Therefore, force could only be used to remove foreign soldiers and mercenaries if it was justified under the reasoning that such action would be necessary to prevent civil war.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|pp=329, 334\u2013335}} ONUC was not also authorised to impose a political solution by force or directly intervene in internal Congolese affairs and, as such, was primarily concerned with reducing the influence of foreign interests in the Katangese conflict.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=402}}\n\nThe Katangese government disregarded the resolution and carried forward with its plans to suppress rebellious [[Baluba]] tribesmen in the northern sections of the province. The resulting rise in tensions was followed by a Katangese attempt on 7 April to [[Battle of Kabalo|seize the town]] of [[Kabalo]]. UN troops resisted, sinking a gendarmerie barge and arresting over two dozen mercenaries. After interrogation, the mercenaries were deported from the Congo.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=392}} The event marked the first use of the permissions of the February resolution.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=393}} The UN then attempted to secure the cooperation of the Belgian and Katangese governments in carrying out the Security Council's decisions, but by May little progress had been made. Believing that Tshombe and his subordinates were only stalling through negotiations, UN officials decided to dispatch a new representative to [[Lubumbashi|\u00c9lisabethville]], the Katangese capital, with demands for immediate compliance with the resolution. A member of the Irish Diplomatic Service, [[Conor Cruise O'Brien]], was appointed to the role and arrived in the city on 14 June.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|pp=396\u2013397}}\n\nMeanwhile, UN officials engaged in negotiations with Belgian Foreign Minister [[Paul-Henri Spaak]] secured an agreement over the withdrawal of certain Belgian political advisers in Katanga. Pressure from Belgium and the UN facilitated the repatriation of two officers in early June, though by the end of the month the Katangese government appeared unwilling to allow further departures. At the beginning of July the UN requested the withdrawal of more advisers and demanded that Georges Thyssens, one of Tshombe's aides, leave the Congo immediately.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=397}} After a few days Thyssens still showed no intention of departing, so O'Brien ordered three Swedish soldiers to forcibly expel him. A scuffle occurred during the ensuing confrontation during which it was rumoured the Thyssens family dog was shot. The episode brought strong protest from the Katangese, who seized the Belgian consulate and expelled an official that had been encouraging his compatriots\u2014as directed by the Belgian Foreign Ministry\u2014to be more accepting of the Belgian and Congolese central governments' attitudes.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=398}}\n\nIn a meeting on 12 July, Spaak suggested to Hammarskj\u00f6ld that the UN should identify all the advisers it wanted to leave, so as to ease the anxieties of other Belgians' who feared their own sudden expulsion and therefore prevent another incident. After some negotiations Tshombe agreed to allow a Katangese delegation to confer with ONUC about the advisers to be removed.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=398}} In the ensuing discussions both parties agreed upon a list of 11 Belgians that should be withdrawn from Katanga. The UN warned that if the advisers were replaced by other foreigners they too would be expelled. By August external involvement in Katanga had been reduced by the UN, but the \"immediate\" withdrawal of mercenaries and foreign advisers as called for in the February resolution had not been achieved. Further progress through negotiation seemed unlikely, as the Katangese were growing more hostile and Spaak was facing increasing opposition in Katanga and Belgium.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|pp=398\u2013399}}\n\nMeanwhile, a new Congolese coalition government had formed in [[Kinshasa|L\u00e9opoldville]] under Prime Minister [[Cyrille Adoula]]. It faced great pressure to reintegrate Katanga into the Congo{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=399}} and risked collapse if this was not achieved, something ONUC was keen to avoid.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|pp=401\u2013402}} With his diplomatic overtures to Tshombe failing, Adoula resolved that Katanga would not end its secession unless threatened with military force. With the army in a state of disarray, the Congolese government instead appealed to ONUC for its intentions.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|pp=400\u2013401}} On 5 August ONUC created an independent Katanga Command under [[Indian Army]] Brigadier K. A. S. Raja with O'Brien as Chief of Mission, allowing local forces more operational initiative.{{sfn|Mockaitis|1999|p=27}}\n\n== Prelude ==\n=== UN preparations ===\nAfter long consideration of the situation, the UN Secretariat determined that if Tshombe failed to comply with its requests that foreign officers of the Katangese Gendarmerie should be forcibly arrested and deported. UN officials hoped that an initial show of force would convince the officers to cooperate and ultimately avoid violent confrontations. The Secretariat never issued an explanation of its decision to carry out this plan, though the mercenary actions in northern Katanga proved that foreign personnel were waging civil war and months of negotiations had done little to bring about their removal.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=402}} Planning for Operation Rum Punch began on 19 August at ONUC Headquarters in [[Kinshasa|L\u00e9opoldville]], the Congolese capital. At [[Kamina Air Base|Kamina Base]] in Katanga (which had been under UN control since 4 August) Irish troops established a detention centre for prisoners.{{sfn|Harvey|2011|loc=7 : 'Smash' : The First Battle of Katanga : \u2013 September 1961}} On 24 August President Kasa-Vubu promulgated Ordinance No. 70, declaring all non-Congolese military personnel in the country not under central government contract to be \"illegal aliens\" and requesting UN assistance in expelling them.{{sfn|Mockaitis|1999|p=27}} As ONUC had been established with the goal of assisting the central government in the \"maintenance of law and order\", this provided the UN further justification to undertake the operation.{{sfn|Bowett|Barton|2008|p=196}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=\"UN Forces in the \u00c9lisabethville area will implement the Security Council Resolution of 21st Feb. 1961 by taking into custody and expelling white officers and mercenaries of the Gendarmerie.\"|source=UN Secretariat order authorising Operation Rum Punch{{sfn|Mockaitis|1999|p=27}}}}\nFaced with no other alternatives, ONUC officials decided to proceed with the plan to arrest and repatriate the Katangese Gendarmerie's foreign cadre.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=404}} On 27 August O'Brien met with Mahmoud Khiary, Vladimir Fabry, and Raja at Kamina Base to make final preparations for the operation.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|pp=404\u2013405}} Raja and his staff had already drawn up plans for the arrest of the foreign personnel{{sfn|O'Brien|1962|p=216}} which had been reviewed by General [[Indar Jit Rikhye]] and diplomat [[Ralph Bunche]] and sanctioned by Hammarskj\u00f6ld.{{sfn|Mockaitis|1999|p=27}} At O'Brien's suggestion the plan was modified to include the occupation of the post office (which hosted the telephone exchange) and radio station and the establishment of a cordon around Katangese Minister of Interior [[Godefroid Munongo]]'s residence. This was to prevent the Katangese from encouraging or coordinating resistance.{{sfn|O'Brien|1962|p=216}} The operation was originally scheduled to take place on 29 August, but Raja moved it up 24 hours earlier to maintain tactical surprise.{{sfn|Chakravorty|1976|p=68}}\n\n=== Opposing forces ===\nOn the eve of Operation Rum Punch the UN had 5,720 troops in Katanga; there were 1,600 Indians, 500 Irish, and 400 Swedes in \u00c9lisabethville, 1,200 Indians in Albertville, 1,000 Indians at Kamina Base, 500 Indians at Kabalo, 400 Ethiopians and Indians in Manono, and 120 Irish in Jadotville.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|pp=405\u2013406}} Only Irish and Swedish units were detailed for arrest duties in \u00c9lisabethville, potentially to avoid aggravating racial tensions.{{sfn|Mockaitis|1999|p=27}}\n\nONUC command estimated that the Katangese Gendarmerie numbered over 13,000 men with about 3,000 in \u00c9lisabethville, 2,000 in Jadotville and the nearby [[Shinkolobwe]] camp, 1,600 in Kolwezi; one battalion (about 800 men) each in Manono, Kongolo, Kipushi, Baudouinville, Mitwaba, Kaniama, and Kaminaville; and half a battalion in Kabongo and Kapanga. Four hundred-and-sixty of their officers were Europeans, who had recently developed a plan for defending Katangese borders from central government forces. These forces were bolstered by armed sections of the local population, especially around Kamina and in the [[Sandoa Territory|Sandoa region]]. The [[Katangese Air Force]] was headquartered in Kolwezi, where gendarmes controlled the [[Kolwezi Airport|local airstrip]] and were in possession of one operational [[Fouga CM.170 Magister]].{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=405}}\n\n== Operation ==\nOperation Rum Punch commenced at 04:00 on 28 August 1961.{{sfn|Power|2016|loc= Chapter 6: A Rum Affair}} Two companies of the Indian [[Dogra Regiment]] seized the radio station and the post office, arresting two Belgian officers.{{sfn|Prasad|2005|p=171}} At the former, a temporary manager broadcast an apology for the temporary suspension of telephone services and read the central government ordinance expelling foreign mercenaries and a speech by Adoula appealing for national unity.{{sfn|O'Brien|1962|p=217}} Several mercenaries avoided capture by seeking refuge with locals or their national consulates. Others remained out of reach deep within the Katangese bush. Near the shore of [[Lake Tanganyika]] in northeastern Katanga Ghanaian troops surrounded mercenary [[Bob Denard]]'s camp. His men wanted to fight, but they were ordered via radio to surrender.{{sfn|Othen|2015|loc=14 : Rumpunch}} Eleven mercenaries were arrested around [[Albertville]], nine were taken in [[Manono, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Manono]], seven in [[Niemba]], and three in [[Nyunzu]].{{sfn|Chakravorty|1976|p=68}} In Kamina, the local Indian officer gave foreign personnel 12 hours to surrender themselves or face the use of force. The mercenaries turned in their weapons without incident and in return accepted drinks from the UN contingent.{{sfn|Gouldthorpe|1961|p=50}}\n\nAt 05:00 in \u00c9lisabethville O'Brien dispatched a Swedish lieutenant to Tshombe's Presidential Palace and to Munongo's villa with two notes explaining the purpose of the operation. After delivering the second message, the lieutenant drove around an ONUC roadblock at a high speed. The Irish peacekeepers manning the post did not recognise him in the dark and opened fire, damaging the rear of his car. One bullet passed through the driver's seat and grazed his back.{{sfn|O'Brien|1962|pp=216\u2013217}}\n\nAt 06:00 O'Brien and Raja went into the \u00c9lisabethville city centre in search of Tshombe. They encountered him in a convoy of government officials on return from a tour. At a meeting in the Presidential Palace, Tshombe and his cabinet requested that the UN terminate the operation. O'Brien and Raja refused, and instead asked for the Katangese to co-operate to prevent any conflict. Tshombe said he would have to discuss the proposition with his ministers and promised they would have a decision by 11:00.{{sfn|O'Brien|1962|p=217}}\n\nAt 15:00 further arrests were suspended,{{sfn|O'Brien|1962|p=221}} with 79 mercenaries already detained.{{sfn|Mockaitis|1999|p=27}} By the end of the day, 81 foreign personnel of the Katangese Gendarmerie had been arrested in Katanga and brought to Kamina base to await deportation.{{sfn|Lipsey|2013|p=538}} Most of the remaining Belgian mercenaries reported to their consulate.{{sfn|Mockaitis|1999|p=28}} In addition to the arrests, two [[Sikorsky Aircraft|Sikorsky]] helicopters, three [[A\u00e9rospatiale Alouette|Aloutte]] helicopters, three [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Dakotas]], four [[de Havilland Dove|Doves]], and two [[de Havilland Heron|Herons]] of the Katangese Air Force were seized. Two Fouga CM.170 Magisters, two Doves, and one [[Piper PA-20 Pacer|Tri-Pacer]] stationed outside of \u00c9lisabethville were not confiscated.{{sfn|Harvey|2011|loc=7 : 'Smash' : The First Battle of Katanga : \u2013 September 1961}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\n=== Analyses ===\nOperation Rum Punch heralded the beginning of the UN's direct clashing with the Katangese state.{{sfn|Power|2016|loc=Chapter 4: The Mercenary Equation}} According to historian Thomas R. Mockaitis, \"Despite its lack of complete success, ''Rumpunch'' could not be considered a complete failure.\"{{sfn|Mockaitis|1999|p=28}} O'Brien called it a \"partial success\"; the operation reinvigorated the Afro-Asian bloc's confidence in ONUC, improved the central government's situation\u2014including the subsequent formal recognition of the legitimacy of Adoula's government by the Soviet Union, and removed numerous mercenaries from Katanga.{{sfn|O'Brien|1962|p=220}} Hammarskj\u00f6ld sent a congratulatory telegram to O'Brien from [[Headquarters of the United Nations|UN Headquarters]] in New York City, writing, \"Congo Club{{efn|\"Congo Club\" was the informal term for an ad hoc group of advisers at the UN Secretariat that discussed issues related to the Congo.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=183}}}} in congress assembled passed unanimous vote of congratulations gratification and sincere respect for an exceedingly sensitive operation carried through with skill and courage\". He did, however, feel that the operation had been terminated too soon.{{sfn|Lipsey|2013|p=539}} Rikhye also expressed his disappointment, noting that \"The UN had it within its grasp to close the ring and remove all unwanted individuals with perhaps a few remaining who could have hidden or vanished among the European civilians.\"{{sfn|Mockaitis|1999|p=27}}\n\nThe day following Rum Punch [[Prime Minister of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]] Sir [[Roy Welensky]] condemned the operation, declaring that it had \"exceeded the UN's mandate.\"{{sfn|Williams|2014|p=52}} ''[[La Libre Belgique]]'' wrote that it had ruined \"the beautiful friendship between black and white\" in Katanga.{{sfn|O'Brien|1962|p=224}}\n\n=== Effects on the Katangese Gendarmerie ===\nThe Belgian government agreed facilitate the repatriation of its nationals serving in the Katangese Gendarmerie, but in practice was only able to order the former Force Publique officers to return to Belgium under threat of losing their official ranks in the Belgian Army. The operation also did not extend to all military centers in Katanga. Thus, many foreign officers, particularly the highly-committed \"ultras\" were able to avoid deportation.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|pp=406\u2013408}} The gendarmerie also underwent a nominal Africanisation; {{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=424}} Colonel [[Norbert Muk\u00e9]], a native Katangese, was made commander of the Katangese Gendarmerie, but in practice its leadership was still heavily influenced by European mercenaries.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=408}} Lieutenant Colonel [[Roger Faulques]], a Frenchman, was made chief of staff.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=424}} In response to Rum Punch, he established a headquarters near Kolwezi to coordinate guerrilla resistance against ONUC.{{sfn|Williams|2014|p=169}}\n\n=== Subsequent events ===\nOn 31 August O'Brien asked Tshombe to dismiss Munongo as he was suspected of encouraging Katangese troops to attack ONUC personnel. Munongo denied the accusation, and Tshombe refused to remove him. On 5 September Katangese Foreign Minister [[\u00c9variste Kimba]] announced to the Katangese Assembly that the government would not yield to further UN demands.{{sfn|O'Ballance|1999|p=53}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== Citations ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* {{cite book| last = Bowett| first = D.

UN troops arrested 79 foreign mercenaries and officers employed by Katanga with little conflict.\n\n== Background ==\n=== Katanga's secession ===\n{{main|Congo Crisis}}\nThe [[Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville)|Republic of the Congo]] became independent from [[Belgium]] on 30 June 1960. On 5 July, disgruntled soldiers of the [[Force Publique]], unhappy with their lack of advancement relative to civilian politicians, began [[1960 Force Publique mutiny|a nationwide mutiny]] against their white officers. The rebellions caused widespread instability and led to the flight of much of the Congo's European population, which was of vital importance to the economy. On July 9 the mutinies spread to the southern province of [[Katanga Province|Katanga]].{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=44}} Katanga contained the vast majority of the Congo's valuable mineral resources and had attracted significant mining activity under Belgian rule.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=31}} Many Katangese thought that they were entitled to the revenue generated through the lucrative industry, and feared that under the new central government led by Prime Minister [[Patrice Lumumba]] it would be redistributed among the Congo's poorer provinces.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=40}}\n\nThe remaining settlers in Katanga, the Belgian government, and members of the [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] [[Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration des associations tribales du Katanga]] (CONAKAT), the ruling party in the Katangese provincial government, blamed Lumumba and his alleged communist sympathies for the collapse in order. With Lumumba refusing to accept the direct intervention of Belgian troops, elements of the Belgian government began pushing for the creation of a separate Katangese state through which European mining interests could be protected.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=44}} On 11 July Belgian metropolitan units were landed across the Congo, without the Congolese government's consent, to disarm the mutinous troops.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=97}} That evening [[Mo\u00efse Tshombe]], President of Katanga Province, citing the collapse of order in the Congo and the threat of a communist takeover, declared the independence of the \"[[State of Katanga]]\" and appealed for Belgian assistance.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=99}} On 12 July Lumumba and President [[Joseph Kasa-Vubu]] appealed to the [[United Nations]] (UN), requesting that international troops be dispatched to the Congo to replace the Belgian forces and reestablish order.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=114}} The [[UN Security Council]] complied, passing several resolutions calling for the withdrawal of Belgian troops and establishing a large multinational peacekeeping mission, the [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]] (known by its French acronym, ONUC).{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=46}}\n\nLumumba demanded that ONUC troops be used to forcibly put down the Katangese secession. The Security Council resolved on 9 August that \"the entry of the United Nations Force into the province of Katanga is necessary for the full implementation of this resolution\" while also deciding that \"the United Nations Force in the Congo will not be a party to or in any way intervene in or be used to influence the outcome of any internal conflict.\" The mobilisation of a Katangese army, dubbed the Katangese Gendarmerie, troubled [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Secretary-General]] [[Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld]], who felt that an armed confrontation would violate ONUC's mandate. Frustrated, Lumumba appealed to [[Eastern Bloc]] nations for military assistance, resulting in a conflict with Kasa-Vubu and ultimately his removal from power in September and eventual murder in January 1961.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|pp=45\u201346}}\n\n=== Katangese forces ===\nImmediately following the declaration of secession, the Katangese government worked to quickly establish its own armed force. Belgian officers and Katangese rank-and-file of the Force Publique formed the nucleus of the new Katangese Gendarmerie, bolstered by the recruitment of tribal warriors. By 26 November 1960 the force consisted of about 7,000 men, though there existed a deficit in training and qualified leadership. This was partly resolved by the loaning of Belgian Army officers from the Belgian government and the institution of several training programs in the metropole for their use.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|pp=47\u201348}}{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=384}} By March 1961 the gendarmerie was composed of 600 European and 8,000 indigenous soldiers.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=49}}\n\n=== Escalation of UN\u2013Katangese tension ===\nThe announcement of Lumumba's death created a sense of urgency among the international community and motivated members of the UN Security Council to strengthen ONUC's powers.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=328}} On 21 February 1961 the [[UN Security Council]] passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 161|a resolution]] permitting ONUC to use military force as a last resort to prevent civil war. As the Congo was already more-or-less in a state of civil war, the resolution gave ONUC significant latitude to act. It also called for the immediate departure of all foreign military personnel and mercenaries from the country, though the use of force was not authorised to carry out the measure. Therefore, force could only be used to remove foreign soldiers and mercenaries if it was justified under the reasoning that such action would be necessary to prevent civil war.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|pp=329, 334\u2013335}} ONUC was not also authorised to impose a political solution by force or directly intervene in internal Congolese affairs and, as such, was primarily concerned with reducing the influence of foreign interests in the Katangese conflict.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=402}}\n\nThe Katangese government disregarded the resolution and carried forward with its plans to suppress rebellious [[Baluba]] tribesmen in the northern sections of the province. The resulting rise in tensions was followed by a Katangese attempt on 7 April to [[Battle of Kabalo|seize the town]] of [[Kabalo]]. UN troops resisted, sinking a gendarmerie barge and arresting over two dozen mercenaries. After interrogation, the mercenaries were deported from the Congo.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=392}} The event marked the first use of the permissions of the February resolution.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=393}} The UN then attempted to secure the cooperation of the Belgian and Katangese governments in carrying out the Security Council's decisions, but by May little progress had been made. Believing that Tshombe and his subordinates were only stalling through negotiations, UN officials decided to dispatch a new representative to [[Lubumbashi|\u00c9lisabethville]], the Katangese capital, with demands for immediate compliance with the resolution. A member of the Irish Diplomatic Service, [[Conor Cruise O'Brien]], was appointed to the role and arrived in the city on 14 June.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|pp=396\u2013397}}\n\nMeanwhile, UN officials engaged in negotiations with Belgian Foreign Minister [[Paul-Henri Spaak]] secured an agreement over the withdrawal of certain Belgian political advisers in Katanga. Pressure from Belgium and the UN facilitated the repatriation of two officers in early June, though by the end of the month the Katangese government appeared unwilling to allow further departures. At the beginning of July the UN requested the withdrawal of more advisers and demanded that Georges Thyssens, one of Tshombe's aides, leave the Congo immediately.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=397}} After a few days Thyssens still showed no intention of departing, so O'Brien ordered three Swedish soldiers to forcibly expel him. A scuffle occurred during the ensuing confrontation during which it was rumoured the Thyssens family dog was shot. The episode brought strong protest from the Katangese, who seized the Belgian consulate and expelled an official that had been encouraging his compatriots\u2014as directed by the Belgian Foreign Ministry\u2014to be more accepting of the Belgian and Congolese central governments' attitudes.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=398}}\n\nIn a meeting on 12 July, Spaak suggested to Hammarskj\u00f6ld that the UN should identify all the advisers it wanted to leave, so as to ease the anxieties of other Belgians' who feared their own sudden expulsion and therefore prevent another incident. After some negotiations Tshombe agreed to allow a Katangese delegation to confer with ONUC about the advisers to be removed.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=398}} In the ensuing discussions both parties agreed upon a list of 11 Belgians that should be withdrawn from Katanga. The UN warned that if the advisers were replaced by other foreigners they too would be expelled. By August external involvement in Katanga had been reduced by the UN, but the \"immediate\" withdrawal of mercenaries and foreign advisers as called for in the February resolution had not been achieved. Further progress through negotiation seemed unlikely, as the Katangese were growing more hostile and Spaak was facing increasing opposition in Katanga and Belgium.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|pp=398\u2013399}}\n\nMeanwhile, a new Congolese coalition government had formed in [[Kinshasa|L\u00e9opoldville]] under Prime Minister [[Cyrille Adoula]]. It faced great pressure to reintegrate Katanga into the Congo{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=399}} and risked collapse if this was not achieved, something ONUC was keen to avoid.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|pp=401\u2013402}} With his diplomatic overtures to Tshombe failing, Adoula resolved that Katanga would not end its secession unless threatened with military force. With the army in a state of disarray, the Congolese government instead appealed to ONUC for its intentions.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|pp=400\u2013401}} On 5 August ONUC created an independent Katanga Command under [[Indian Army]] Brigadier K. A. S. Raja with O'Brien as Chief of Mission, allowing local forces more operational initiative.{{sfn|Mockaitis|1999|p=27}}\n\n== Prelude ==\nAfter long consideration of the situation, the UN Secretariat determined that if Tshombe failed to comply with its requests that foreign officers of the Katangese Gendarmerie should be forcibly arrested and deported. UN officials hoped that an initial show of force would convince the officers to cooperate and ultimately avoid violent confrontations. The Secretariat never issued an explanation of its decision to carry out this plan, though the mercenary actions in northern Katanga proved that foreign personnel were waging civil war and months of negotiations had done little to bring about their removal.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=402}} Planning for Operation Rum Punch began on 19 August at ONUC Headquarters in [[Kinshasa|L\u00e9opoldville]], the Congolese capital. At [[Kamina Air Base|Kamina Base]] in Katanga (which had been under UN control since 4 August) Irish troops established a detention centre for prisoners.{{sfn|Harvey|2011|loc=7 : 'Smash' : The First Battle of Katanga : \u2013 September 1961}} On 24 August President Kasa-Vubu promulgated Ordinance No. 70, declaring all non-Congolese military personnel in the country not under central government contract to be \"illegal aliens\" and requesting UN assistance in expelling them.{{sfn|Mockaitis|1999|p=27}} As ONUC had been established with the goal of assisting the central government in the \"maintenance of law and order\", this provided the UN further justification to undertake the operation.{{sfn|Bowett|Barton|2008|p=196}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=\"UN Forces in the \u00c9lisabethville area will implement the Security Council Resolution of 21st Feb. 1961 by taking into custody and expelling white officers and mercenaries of the Gendarmerie.\"|source=UN Secretariat order authorising Operation Rum Punch{{sfn|Mockaitis|1999|p=27}}}}\nFaced with no other alternatives, ONUC officials decided to proceed with the plan to arrest and repatriate the Katangese Gendarmerie's foreign cadre.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=404}} On 27 August O'Brien met with Mahmoud Khiary, Vladimir Fabry, and Raja at Kamina Base to make final preparations for the operation.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|pp=404\u2013405}} Raja and his staff had already drawn up plans for the arrest of the foreign personnel{{sfn|O'Brien|1962|p=216}} which had been reviewed by General [[Indar Jit Rikhye]] and diplomat [[Ralph Bunche]] and sanctioned by Hammarskj\u00f6ld.{{sfn|Mockaitis|1999|p=27}} At O'Brien's suggestion the plan was modified to include the occupation of the post office (which hosted the telephone exchange) and radio station and the establishment of a cordon around Katangese Minister of Interior [[Godefroid Munongo]]'s residence. This was to prevent the Katangese from encouraging or coordinating resistance.{{sfn|O'Brien|1962|p=216}} The operation was originally scheduled to take place on 29 August, but Raja moved it up 24 hours earlier to maintain tactical surprise.{{sfn|Chakravorty|1976|p=68}}\n\n=== Opposing forces ===\nOn the eve of Operation Rum Punch the UN had 5,720 troops in Katanga; there were 1,600 Indians, 500 Irish, and 400 Swedes in \u00c9lisabethville, 1,200 Indians in Albertville, 1,000 Indians at Kamina Base, 500 Indians at Kabalo, 400 Ethiopians and Indians in Manono, and 120 Irish in Jadotville.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|pp=405\u2013406}} Only Irish and Swedish units were detailed for arrest duties in \u00c9lisabethville, potentially to avoid aggravating racial tensions.{{sfn|Mockaitis|1999|p=27}}\n\nONUC command estimated that the Katangese Gendarmerie numbered over 13,000 men with about 3,000 in \u00c9lisabethville, 2,000 in Jadotville and the nearby [[Shinkolobwe]] camp, 1,600 in Kolwezi; one battalion (about 800 men) each in Manono, Kongolo, Kipushi, Baudouinville, Mitwaba, Kaniama, and Kaminaville; and half a battalion in Kabongo and Kapanga. Four hundred-and-sixty of their officers were Europeans, who had recently developed a plan for defending Katangese borders from central government forces. These forces were bolstered by armed sections of the local population, especially around Kamina and in the [[Sandoa Territory|Sandoa region]]. The [[Katangese Air Force]] was headquartered in Kolwezi, where gendarmes controlled the [[Kolwezi Airport|local airstrip]] and were in possession of one operational [[Fouga CM.170 Magister]].{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=405}}\n\n== Operation ==\nOperation Rum Punch commenced at 04:00 on 28 August 1961.{{sfn|Power|2016|loc= Chapter 6: A Rum Affair}} Two companies of the Indian [[Dogra Regiment]] seized the radio station and the post office, arresting two Belgian officers.{{sfn|Prasad|2005|p=171}} At the former, a temporary manager broadcast an apology for the temporary suspension of telephone services and read the central government ordinance expelling foreign mercenaries and a speech by Adoula appealing for national unity.{{sfn|O'Brien|1962|p=217}} Several mercenaries avoided capture by seeking refuge with locals or their national consulates. Others remained out of reach deep within the Katangese bush. Near the shore of [[Lake Tanganyika]] in northeastern Katanga Ghanaian troops surrounded mercenary [[Bob Denard]]'s camp. His men wanted to fight, but they were ordered via radio to surrender.{{sfn|Othen|2015|loc=14 : Rumpunch}} Eleven mercenaries were arrested around [[Albertville]], nine were taken in [[Manono, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Manono]], seven in [[Niemba]], and three in [[Nyunzu]].{{sfn|Chakravorty|1976|p=68}} In Kamina, the local Indian officer gave foreign personnel 12 hours to surrender themselves or face the use of force. The mercenaries turned in their weapons without incident and in return accepted drinks from the UN contingent.{{sfn|Gouldthorpe|1961|p=50}}\n\nAt 05:00 in \u00c9lisabethville O'Brien dispatched a Swedish lieutenant to Tshombe's Presidential Palace and to Munongo's villa with two notes explaining the purpose of the operation. After delivering the second message, the lieutenant drove around an ONUC roadblock at a high speed. The Irish peacekeepers manning the post did not recognise him in the dark and opened fire, damaging the rear of his car. One bullet passed through the driver's seat and grazed his back.{{sfn|O'Brien|1962|pp=216\u2013217}}\n\nAt 06:00 O'Brien and Raja went into the \u00c9lisabethville city centre in search of Tshombe. They encountered him in a convoy of government officials on return from a tour. At a meeting in the Presidential Palace, Tshombe and his cabinet requested that the UN terminate the operation. O'Brien and Raja refused, and instead asked for the Katangese to co-operate to prevent any conflict. Tshombe said he would have to discuss the proposition with his ministers and promised they would have a decision by 11:00.{{sfn|O'Brien|1962|p=217}}\n\nAt 15:00 further arrests were suspended,{{sfn|O'Brien|1962|p=221}} with 79 mercenaries already detained.{{sfn|Mockaitis|1999|p=27}} By the end of the day, 81 foreign personnel of the Katangese Gendarmerie had been arrested in Katanga and brought to Kamina base to await deportation.{{sfn|Lipsey|2013|p=538}} Most of the remaining Belgian mercenaries reported to their consulate.{{sfn|Mockaitis|1999|p=28}} In addition to the arrests, two [[Sikorsky Aircraft|Sikorsky]] helicopters, three [[A\u00e9rospatiale Alouette|Aloutte]] helicopters, three [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Dakotas]], four [[de Havilland Dove|Doves]], and two [[de Havilland Heron|Herons]] of the Katangese Air Force were seized. Two Fouga CM.170 Magisters, two Doves, and one [[Piper PA-20 Pacer|Tri-Pacer]] stationed outside of \u00c9lisabethville were not confiscated.{{sfn|Harvey|2011|loc=7 : 'Smash' : The First Battle of Katanga : \u2013 September 1961}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\n=== Analyses ===\nOperation Rum Punch heralded the beginning of the UN's direct clashing with the Katangese state.{{sfn|Power|2016|loc=Chapter 4: The Mercenary Equation}} According to historian Thomas R. Mockaitis, \"Despite its lack of complete success, ''Rumpunch'' could not be considered a complete failure.\"{{sfn|Mockaitis|1999|p=28}} O'Brien called it a \"partial success\"; the operation reinvigorated the Afro-Asian bloc's confidence in ONUC, improved the central government's situation\u2014including the subsequent formal recognition of the legitimacy of Adoula's government by the Soviet Union, and removed numerous mercenaries from Katanga.{{sfn|O'Brien|1962|p=220}} Hammarskj\u00f6ld sent a congratulatory telegram to O'Brien from [[Headquarters of the United Nations|UN Headquarters]] in New York City, writing, \"Congo Club{{efn|\"Congo Club\" was the informal term for an ad hoc group of advisers at the UN Secretariat that discussed issues related to the Congo.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=183}}}} in congress assembled passed unanimous vote of congratulations gratification and sincere respect for an exceedingly sensitive operation carried through with skill and courage\". He did, however, feel that the operation had been terminated too soon.{{sfn|Lipsey|2013|p=539}} Rikhye also expressed his disappointment, noting that \"The UN had it within its grasp to close the ring and remove all unwanted individuals with perhaps a few remaining who could have hidden or vanished among the European civilians.\"{{sfn|Mockaitis|1999|p=27}}\n\nThe day following Rum Punch [[Prime Minister of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]] Sir [[Roy Welensky]] condemned the operation, declaring that it had \"exceeded the UN's mandate.\"{{sfn|Williams|2014|p=52}} ''[[La Libre Belgique]]'' wrote that it had ruined \"the beautiful friendship between black and white\" in Katanga.{{sfn|O'Brien|1962|p=224}}\n\n=== Effects on the Katangese Gendarmerie ===\nThe Belgian government agreed facilitate the repatriation of its nationals serving in the Katangese Gendarmerie, but in practice was only able to order the former Force Publique officers to return to Belgium under threat of losing their official ranks in the Belgian Army. The operation also did not extend to all military centers in Katanga. Thus, many foreign officers, particularly the highly-committed \"ultras\" were able to avoid deportation.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|pp=406\u2013408}} The gendarmerie also underwent a nominal Africanisation; {{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=424}} Colonel [[Norbert Muk\u00e9]], a native Katangese, was made commander of the Katangese Gendarmerie, but in practice its leadership was still heavily influenced by European mercenaries.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=408}} Lieutenant Colonel [[Roger Faulques]], a Frenchman, was made chief of staff.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=424}} In response to Rum Punch, he established a headquarters near Kolwezi to coordinate guerrilla resistance against ONUC.{{sfn|Williams|2014|p=169}}\n\n=== Subsequent events ===\nOn 31 August O'Brien asked Tshombe to dismiss Munongo as he was suspected of encouraging Katangese troops to attack ONUC personnel. Munongo denied the accusation, and Tshombe refused to remove him. On 5 September Katangese Foreign Minister [[\u00c9variste Kimba]] announced to the Katangese Assembly that the government would not yield to further UN demands.{{sfn|O'Ballance|1999|p=53}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== Citations ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* {{cite book| last = Bowett| first = D.

Any player goes first, and turns proceed clockwise (i.e. to the left).\n# On your turn, you must either ''attack'' or ''split'', but not both.\n# To ''attack'', use one of your live hands to strike an opponent's live hand. When you do this, the number of fingers on the opponent's struck hand will increase by the number of fingers on the hand you used to strike.\n# To ''split'', strike your own two hands together, and transfer fingers from one hand to the other as desired. You must make a meaningful move (e.g. going [2, 3]\u2013>[3, 2] is prohibited) and you must not kill one of your own hands (e.g. going [1, 1]\u2013>[0, 2] is prohibited).\n# If any hand of any player reaches exactly five fingers, then it is ''killed'' and becomes dead. That hand must be closed, so as to indicate that it has zero fingers. A player may ''revive'' their own dead hand using a split, as long as they follow the rules in #4. However, players may not revive opponents' hands using an attack. Therefore, a player with two dead hands is useless, and so is knocked out of the game.\n# If any hand of any player reaches more than five fingers, then subtract five fingers from that hand to keep it alive. In other words, if a 4-finger hand strikes a 2-finger hand, then the 2-finger hand will have 6 fingers. But since it has more than 5 fingers, then subtract 5 fingers. Now the hand that was struck will have only 1 finger, and therefore it is still alive. This is called ''roll-over.''\n# You win once all your opponents are knocked out of the game (by each having two dead hands at once).\n\n==Optimal strategy==\nUsing the rules above, two perfect players will play indefinitely, going in a loop. In fact, even very inexperienced players can avoid losing by simply looking one move ahead.\n\nUsing the cut-off variant, the first player can force a win. One winning strategy is to always reach one of the following configurations after each of your moves, preferentially choosing the first one in the list if there is more than one choice. Each configuration will be given as [a,b],[c,d] where [a,b] represents your two hands (ignoring order) and [c,d] represents your opponent's.\n* [2,1],[1,1] (You start here.)\n* [?,?],[1,2] (Win immediately if possible.)\n\nConversely, if tapping one's own hand is not allowed, but splitting two live hands into one is allowed, then the second player has a winning strategy.<ref>http://www.wikihow.com/Always-Win-Chopsticks</ref>{{How|date=October 2018}}\n\n==Abbreviation==\nA chopsticks position can be easily abbreviated to a four-digit code [ABCD]. A and B are the hands (in ascending order of fingers) of the player who is about to take their turn. C and D are the hands (in ascending order of fingers) of the player who is not about to take their turn. It is important to notate each player's hands in ascending order, so that a single distinct position isn't accidentally represented by two codes. For example, the code [1032] is a mistake, and should be notated [0123].\n\nTherefore, the starting position is [1111]. The next position must be [1211]. The next position must be either [1212] or [1312]. Treating each position as a 4-digit number, the smallest position is 0000, and the largest position is 4444.\n\nThis abbreviation formula expands easily to games with more players. A three-player game can be represented by six-digits (e.g. [111211]), where each pair of adjacent digits represents a single player, and each pair is ordered based on when players will take their turns. The leftmost pair represents the hands of the player about to take his turn; the middle pair represents the player who will go next, and so on. The rightmost pair represents the player who must wait the longest before his turn (usually because he just went).\n\n==Moves==\nUnder normal rules, there are a maximum of 14 possible moves:\n\n* Four attacks (A-C, A-D, B-C, B-D)\n* Four divisions (02-11, 03-12, 04-13, 04-22)\n* Six transfers (13-22, 22-13, 14-23, 23-14, 24-33, 33-24)\n\nHowever, only 5 or less of these are available on a given turn. For example, the early position 1312 can go to 2213, 1313, 2413, 0113, or 1222.\n\n==Variations==\n* '''Suicide''': You are allowed to kill one of your own hands with a split. This allows for quicker defeations. For example, in the position [1201], you could execute 12-03, thus bringing the game to [0103]. The opponent is forced to play B-D, bringing the game to [0401], at which point you could swiftly finish him off.\n* '''Swaps''': If you have two unequal live hands, you may swap them (essentially forfeiting your turn).\n* '''Sudden Death''': You lose when you only have one finger left total. Alternately, each player could begin with three lives, and every time they get down to [01], they lose a life.\n* '''Meta''': If your hands add up to over five, you can combine them, subtract five from the total, and then split up the remainder. For example, [44] adds up to 8. So under Meta rules, you can combine them into 8, which becomes 3, which you could then split into [12]. Therefore you could go from [44] to [12] in a single move. Meta unlocks 2 new possible moves (34-11, 44-12). If playing both Meta and Suicide, then 4 additional moves are unlocked (24-01, 33-01, 34-02, 44-03), for a total maximum of 20 possible moves.\n* '''Logan Clause''': You are allowed to suicide and swap, but only if you do both at the same time (i.e. swap your dead hand for your live one).\n* '''Cutoff''': If a hand gets above 5 fingers, it is dead.\n* '''Zombies''': In 3 or more players, if a player is knocked out, then he is permanently reduced to 1 finger on 1 hand. On his turn, he may attack, but he may not split or be attacked (invented by Chris Bandy).\n* '''Halvesies''': Splitting is only allowed if you are dividing an even number into two equal halves. Or optionally, an odd number being divided as evenly as possible (using whole numbers). In this variation the second player has a winning strategy (can always force a win).<ref>[https://sakuraentorizasshi.wordpress.com/2008/10/16/japanese-games-chopsticks-hand-game/ https://wordpress.com/japanese-games-chopsticks-hand-game/] Japanese games \u2013 Chopsticks (hand game), 2008</ref>\n* '''Stumps''': If you are at [01], you are allowed to split to [0.5 0.5].\n* '''Larger Numbers''': Numerals from 1\u20139 are allowed, where a hand dies at 10. In this case, [[Chinese number gestures|Chinese hand numerals]] are often used. This variation often includes roll-overs.\n* '''Suns''': Both players start with a 4 in each of their hands ([4444]). This is a position that is unreachable in normal gameplay (i.e. from the opening position [1111]).\n\n==Positions==\n\nSince the roll-over amount is 5, chopsticks is a base-5 game. Each position is four digits long. Counting from 0000 to 4444 (in base-5) gives us 625 positions. However, most of these positions are incorrect notations (e.g. 0132, 1023, and 1032). They appear different but are functionally the same in gameplay. To find the number of functionally distinct positions, we simply square the number of functionally distinct pairs. There are 15 distinct pairs (00, 01, 02, 03, 04, 11, 12, 13, 14, 22, 23, 24, 33, 34, and 44). Since either player could have any of these pairs, we simply multiply 15*15, which gives us 225 functionally distinct positions.\n\n* There are 625 positions, including redundancies.\n* There are 225 functionally distinct positions.\n* There are 204 reachable positions.\n\nThere are 21 unreachable positions: 0000, 0100, 0200, 0300, 0400, 1100, 1101, 1200, 1300, 1400, 2200, 2202, 2300, 2400, 3300, 3303, 3400, 3444, 4400, 4404, and 4444. Fifteen of these are simply one player having each of the 15 distinct pairs, and the other player being dead. The problem is that the dead player is the player who just took his turn (hence the \"00\" on the right side). Since you can't lose on your own turn, these 15 positions are obviously unreachable. The remaining six positions are not as obviously unreachable, but can be demonstrated as such:\n\n# 1101 is unreachable because the player who just went [01] would not be able to split, so therefore that player must have attacked using his [01]. But there's no way to use [01] to attack an enemy so that they move to [11]. That would require attacking a dead hand, which is illegal.\n# 2202 is unreachable for the same reasons as 1101. [02] cannot be a product of a split, since killing your own hand is illegal. And using a 2 to attack an enemy, so that the enemy's pair becomes [22], is impossible, as that again would require attacking a dead hand.\n# 3303 is unreachable for the same reasons as 1101 and 2202.\n# 3444 is actually reachable, but only from 4444. Since 4444 is not reachable from 1111, neither is 3444.\n# 4404 is unreachable for the same reasons as 1101, 2202, and 3303.\n# 4444 is unreachable because a player cannot reach [44] from a split, and therefore had to already have [44]. The only possible pair that goes to [44] after being attacked by [44] is [04], which again requires that a dead hand be attacked.\n\nIn the \"Suns\" variant, two new positions are unlocked (4444, 3444), for a total of 206 reachable positions. However, after two moves, it is impossible to return to either 4444 or 3444.\n\nIn the \"Suicide\" variant, three new positions are unlocked (2202, 3303, 4404), for a total of 207 reachable positions. Unlike the \"Suns\" variant, these three positions can be accessed mid-game.\n\nTherefore, playing \"Suicide\" and \"Suns\" together unlocks five new positions, for a total of 209 reachable positions.\n\nThere are 14 reachable endgames: 0001, 0002, 0003, 0004, 0011, 0012, 0013, 0014, 0022, 0023, 0024, 0033, 0034, 0044. Satisfyingly enough, these are all the 14 possible endgames; in other words, someone can win using any of the 14 distinct live pairs. Out of these 14 endgames, the first player wins 8 of them, assuming that the games are ended in the minimum amount of moves.\n\nChopsticks can be generalized into a (p,h,r)-type game, where ''p'' is the number of players, ''h'' is the number of hands each player has, and ''r'' is the roll-over amount. In addition, players can start with varying numbers of sticks in each hand, although this isn't an essential property of the game.\n\n* With 2 players, there are 204 positions.\n* With 3 players, there are 3,337 positions.\n* With 4 players, there are over 25,000 positions.\n\n* With 2 hands, there are 204 positions.\n* With 3 hands, there are 1,183 positions.\n* With 4 hands, there are over 4,000 positions.\n\n* With a roll-over of 5, there are 204 positions.\n* With a roll-over of 6, there are 412 positions.\n* With a roll-over of 7, there are 748 positions.\n* With a roll-over of 8, there are 1,250 positions.\n* With a roll-over of 9, there are 1,969 positions.\n* With a roll-over of 10, there are 2,958 positions.\n\n==Game lengths==\nThe shortest possible game is 5 moves. There is one instance:\n# 1111 1211 1312 0113 1401 0014\n\nThe longest possible game that gets farther from the starting point with each move is 9 moves. There are two instances:\n# 1111 1211 1212 2212 2322 0223 0202 0402 0104 0001\n# 1111 1211 1212 2312 2323 0323 0303 0103 0401 0004\n\nThe longest possible game with revisitation is indefinite.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Morra (game)]] \u2013 a different hand-game, which is based on chance rather than logic.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://gamejolt.com/games/chopsticks-hand-game-addition/167583// Unbeatable Chopsticks AI Bot].

Fifteen of these are simply one player having each of the 15 distinct pairs, and the other player being dead. The problem is that the dead player is the player who just took his turn (hence the \"00\" on the right side). Since you can't lose on your own turn, these 15 positions are obviously unreachable. The remaining six positions are not as obviously unreachable, but can be demonstrated as such:\n\n# 1101 is unreachable because the player who just went [01] would not be able to split, so therefore that player must have attacked using his [01]. But there's no way to use [01] to attack an enemy so that they move to [11]. That would require attacking a dead hand, which is illegal.\n# 2202 is unreachable for the same reasons as 1101. [02] cannot be a product of a split, since killing your own hand is illegal. And using a 2 to attack an enemy, so that the enemy's pair becomes [22], is impossible, as that again would require attacking a dead hand.\n# 3303 is unreachable for the same reasons as 1101 and 2202.\n# 3444 is actually reachable, but only from 4444. Since 4444 is not reachable from 1111, neither is 3444.\n# 4404 is unreachable for the same reasons as 1101, 2202, and 3303.\n# 4444 is unreachable because a player cannot reach [44] from a split, and therefore had to already have [44]. The only possible pair that goes to [44] after being attacked by [44] is [04], which again requires that a dead hand be attacked.\n\nIn the \"Suns\" variant, two new positions are unlocked (4444, 3444), for a total of 206 reachable positions. However, after two moves, it is impossible to return to either 4444 or 3444.\n\nIn the \"Suicide\" variant, three new positions are unlocked (2202, 3303, 4404), for a total of 207 reachable positions. Unlike the \"Suns\" variant, these three positions can be accessed mid-game.\n\nTherefore, playing \"Suicide\" and \"Suns\" together unlocks five new positions, for a total of 209 reachable positions.\n\nThere are 14 reachable endgames: 0001, 0002, 0003, 0004, 0011, 0012, 0013, 0014, 0022, 0023, 0024, 0033, 0034, 0044. Satisfyingly enough, these are all the 14 possible endgames; in other words, someone can win using any of the 14 distinct live pairs. Out of these 14 endgames, the first player wins 8 of them, assuming that the games are ended in the minimum amount of moves.\n\nChopsticks can be generalized into a (p,h,r)-type game, where ''p'' is the number of players, ''h'' is the number of hands each player has, and ''r'' is the roll-over amount. In addition, players can start with varying numbers of sticks in each hand, although this isn't an essential property of the game.\n\n* With 2 players, there are 204 \n* With 3 players, there are 3,337 \n* With 4 players, there are over 25,000 positions.\n\n* With 2 hands, there are 204 \n* With 3 hands, there are 1,183 \n* With 4 hands, there are over 4,000 positions.\n\n* With a roll-over of 5, there are 204 \n* With a roll-over of 6, there are 412 \n* With a roll-over of 7, there are 748 \n* With a roll-over of 8, there are 1,250 \n* With a roll-over of 9, there are 1,969 \n* With a roll-over of 10, there are 2,958 positions.\n\n==Game lengths==\nThe shortest possible game is 5 moves. There is one instance:\n# 1111 1211 1312 0113 1401 0014\n\nThe longest possible game that gets farther from the starting point with each move is 9 moves. There are two instances:\n# 1111 1211 1212 2212 2322 0223 0202 0402 0104 0001\n# 1111 1211 1212 2312 2323 0323 0303 0103 0401 0004\n\nThe longest possible game with revisitation is indefinite.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Morra (game)]] \u2013 a different hand-game, which is based on chance rather than logic.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://gamejolt.com/games/chopsticks-hand-game-addition/167583// Unbeatable Chopsticks AI Bot].

On the same day an alleged attack on Lakshmanananda Saraswati and his driver by some Christians after some of his body-guards allegedly vandalized church equipment.\n\nClashes between the Kui samaj which protested the tribal status to the Christians together with groups led by [[Vishva Hindu Parishad|Vishwa Hindu Parishad]], [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh|Rashtriya Swayamswvak Sangh]], [[Bajrang Dal]] and the [[Vanavasi Kalyan Ashram]] against the Christians erupted after these incidents, where more than 100 churches and Church institutions, 700 houses were burnt down, vandalized or damaged. During the final days of the riots there was also a Christian retaliation in which Christian mobs burnt down about 120 houses of Hindus at different places in the district.\n\nThe official death toll suggested 3 Christians were killed but other reports put the death toll to nearly 50. \n== Background ==\n\n=== Kandha\u2013Pana tensions ===\nThe [[kandhamal district]] is home more than 100,000 Christians where 60% of them converted from the [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|Scheduled Castes]] (SC) and are locally called as the Pana Christians (Pana). They were dalits and they speak [[Kui language (India)|Kui language]] like tribal Kandhas. The district has been ethnically divided for decades between the tribal Kui-speaking Kandha tribals, and lower caste Kui-speaking Christian Panas, who occupy a dominant position in their society. The \"Kui Samaj\" which is a Sangh-affiliated tribal organization, claimed to represent all the Kandha tribals, who were nearly 52% of the population in the district.{{Sfn|JPDC|2008|p=29}} According to the Constitution, the reservation benefits are removed from the SCs after conversion but the Pana Christians demanded the [[Scheduled Tribe|Scheduled tribe]] (ST) status after the Presidential Order of 2002 which mentioned the Kui tribes in the ST category since they also speak the kui language. This was opposed by the [[Vishva Hindu Parishad|Vishwa Hindu Parishad]] (VHP) and the Kui Association and other political leaders who depend on Hindu tribals to support their vote bank in the area.

The pandal which had been constructed on the same spot for number of years was warned to be removed this year by some local Hindus because it was located in the same area where a recent Durga Puja clebrations took place. On, December 23rd, [[Narendra Modi]] was celebrating his re-election as chief minister in Gujarat. The activists of the Sangh-affiliated Kui Samaj who had a strained relationship with the Pana Christians called for a Statewide [[bandh]]{{angle bracket|shutdown}} on December 24th and December 25th of 2007 to protest against granting of  the ST caste status to the SC Pana Christians allegly with the support of the.<ref name=\":4\" /> Christians were also warned not to put-up Christmas decorations due to the fact that some Hindus also celebrated Christmas along with them. Due to these tensions several Christian groups asked for extra police protection for their Christmas celebrations.{{Sfn|Robinson|2010|p=265}}\n\nDespite the Kui Samaj's call for the Statewide bandh, the police opened the local market on December 24th at about 7 a.m in Brahmanigaon after recommendation by some christian groups for their Christmas preparations. About two hours late a large group allegedly led by a local RSS leader, Bikram Rout, arrived in the market and attempted to forcefully shut it down but the police kept it open. Later scuffles started between the Hindu and the Christian merchants after the group led by the RSS leader allegedly roughed up with some Christians in the market and the market was eventually closed down.{{Sfn|Robinson|2010|p=265}}\n\n=== Lakshmanananda Saraswati ===\nOn December 24th, at about 10.45 am, Lakshmanananda Saraswati, while travelling to the town of Brahmanigaon for a yagna ritual in his car was forced to stop after a bus broke down in front of his vehicle. Hearing Christmas music coming from a nearby church, he sent his bodyguards to ask it to be turned down. His body guards allegedly roughed up on some Christians and vandalized the Church equipments. Saraswati claimed that a group of Christians injured him and his driver and damaged his car, while eye-witnesses and doctor's statements said that he did not appear seriously hurt.{{Sfn|JPDC|2008|p=25}} Yet, pictures of him, lying in a hospital bed were circulated widely in the internet and in the news reports.

The district has been ethnically divided for decades between the tribal Kui-speaking Kandha tribals, and lower caste Kui-speaking Christian Panas, who occupy a dominant position in their society. The \"Kui Samaj\" which is a Sangh-affiliated tribal organization, claimed to represent all the Kandha tribals, who were nearly 52% of the population in the district.{{Sfn|JPDC|2008|p=29}} According to the Constitution, the reservation benefits are removed from the SCs after conversion but the Pana Christians demanded the [[Scheduled Tribe|Scheduled tribe]] (ST) status after the Presidential Order of 2002 which mentioned the Kui tribes in the ST category since they also speak the kui language. This was opposed by the [[Vishva Hindu Parishad|Vishwa Hindu Parishad]] (VHP) and the Kui Association and other political leaders who depend on Hindu tribals to support their vote bank in the area.

He demonstrated organizational ability and populist political instincts. These abilities allowed the SDP to gain in Zagreb blue-collar neighborhoods and attract votes which the [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ) and its then-president [[Franjo Tu\u0111man]] had considered theirs by default. As such, he proved to be a valuable asset for the Social Democratic Party. In 1993 he became party secretary.<ref name=Barilar/>\n\nConflict between HDZ and SDP manifested in the [[1995 Croatian parliamentary election|1995 parliamentary]] and City of [[Zagreb]] elections, leading to the [[Zagreb Crisis]]: an electoral alliance (in which the SDP was a major partner) won a majority in the Zagreb elections and chose [[Goran Grani\u0107]] as the new mayor, but Franjo Tu\u0111man used a legal loophole to stop Grani\u0107 from taking office. Several subsequent elections were held, with the SDP winning each time and Tu\u0111man promptly removing every candidate. For a time Zagreb was a city without a mayor, which led to public unrest and protests in [[Ban Jela\u010di\u0107 Square]]. With the final 1997 election of the HDZ candidate [[Marina Matulovi\u0107-Dropuli\u0107]] as the mayor of Zagreb, the crisis faded. Bandi\u0107 played a role in the crisis by becoming a city councilman in 1995 and the leader of the Zagreb SDP in 1997.<ref name=javno_biografija>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.javno.com/hr/hrvatska/clanak.php?id=49365\n |title       = Biografija: Milan Bandi\u0107\n |date        = 2007-06-02\n |accessdate  = 2008-08-01\n |work        = Javno.hr\n |language    = Croatian\n |url-status  = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://www.webcitation.org/68EJ2pyfI?url=http://dalje.com/hr-hrvatska/biografija--milan-bandic/49365\n |archivedate = 2012-06-06\n}}</ref>\n\nDuring the first campaign his [[Herzegovina|Herzegovinian]] background became an issue, as the [[Croatian Peasant Party]] (HSS) suggested that only a native citizen of Zagreb could become the city's mayor.

He demonstrated organizational ability and populist political instincts. These abilities allowed the SDP to gain in Zagreb blue-collar neighborhoods and attract votes which the [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ) and its then-president [[Franjo Tu\u0111man]] had considered theirs by default. As such, he proved to be a valuable asset for the Social Democratic Party. In 1993 he became party secretary.<ref name=Barilar/>\n\nConflict between HDZ and SDP manifested in the [[1995 Croatian parliamentary election|1995 parliamentary]] and City of [[Zagreb]] elections, leading to the [[Zagreb Crisis]]: an electoral alliance (in which the SDP was a major partner) won a majority in the Zagreb elections and chose [[Goran Grani\u0107]] as the new mayor, but Franjo Tu\u0111man used a legal loophole to stop Grani\u0107 from taking office. Several subsequent elections were held, with the SDP winning each time and Tu\u0111man promptly removing every candidate. For a time Zagreb was a city without a mayor, which led to public unrest and protests in [[Ban Jela\u010di\u0107 Square]]. With the final 1997 election of the HDZ candidate [[Marina Matulovi\u0107-Dropuli\u0107]] as the mayor of Zagreb, the crisis faded. Bandi\u0107 played a role in the crisis by becoming a city councilman in 1995 and the leader of the Zagreb SDP in 1997.<ref name=javno_biografija>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.javno.com/hr/hrvatska/clanak.php?id=49365\n |title       = Biografija: Milan Bandi\u0107\n |date        = 2007-06-02\n |accessdate  = 2008-08-01\n |work        = Javno.hr\n |language    = Croatian\n |url-status  = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://www.webcitation.org/68EJ2pyfI?url=http://dalje.com/hr-hrvatska/biografija--milan-bandic/49365\n |archivedate = 2012-06-06\n}}</ref>\n\nDuring the first campaign his [[Herzegovina|Herzegovinian]] background became an issue, as the [[Croatian Peasant Party]] (HSS) suggested that only a native citizen of Zagreb could become the city's mayor. HSS also launched a propaganda campaign against [[Herzegovinians]] in an effort to undermine Bandi\u0107's campaign. The party hoped that the majority of Zagreb voters would turn away from Bandi\u0107. Those expectations were not fulfilled and Bandi\u0107 later used his Herzegovinian background as an advantage, broadening his support among the ordinary citizens of Zagreb.\n\nThe HDZ under Bandi\u0107 eventually lost power in the Croatian capital in 2000.<ref name=Barilar/>\n\n==={{anchor|First and second term (2000\u20132002)}}First and second terms (2000\u20132002)===\n{{see also|2000 Zagreb local elections|2001 Zagreb local elections}}\n\nBandi\u0107 was elected [[mayor]] of Zagreb in 2000<ref name=izbori>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.zgizbori.hr/2000Lokalni/izbori_2000_.html\n | title = Izbori odr\u017eani 7. svibnja 2000.\n | work = Gradski zavod za automatsku obradu podataka\n | accessdate = 2008-07-27\n | language = Croatian\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100129103926/http://www.zgizbori.hr/2000Lokalni/izbori_2000_.html\n | archive-date = 2010-01-29\n | url-status = dead\n}}</ref> and re-elected in the city election in 2001.<ref name=izbori_2001>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.zgizbori.hr/2001Lokalni/rezultati.html\n| title = Izbori odr\u017eani 20. svibnja 2001.\n| work = City Bureau for Automatic Data Processing\n| accessdate = 2008-08-04\n| language = Croatian\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080316190322/http://www.zgizbori.hr/2001Lokalni/rezultati.html\n| archive-date = 2008-03-16\n| url-status = dead\n}}</ref> His rise in influence among SDP politicians and on the Zagreb political scene created a backlash by the [[Croatian People's Party]] (HNS), the other left-of-center party led by [[Vesna Pusi\u0107]], who did not trust his nationalist populism and his occasional run-ins with the courts. The HNS campaigned against the SDP in the 2000 elections. However, the HNS entered into a coalition with the SDP in 2001.

He tried to bribe the officer who stopped him and threatened the officer with his alleged connections in the [[Ministry of the Interior (Croatia)|Ministry of the Interior]].

[[Legislative elections in South Korea|Elections to the National Assembly]] are held every four years. The latest [[2020 South Korean legislative election|legislative elections]] were held on 15 April 2020. Single-member constituencies comprise 253 of the assembly's seats, while the remaining 47 are allocated by [[proportional representation]], 30 of which are used to compensate for the Single-member constituencies. Members serve four-year terms.\n\nThe unicameral assembly consists of at least 200 members according to the [[Constitution of South Korea|South Korean constitution]]. In 1990 the assembly had 299 seats, 224 of which were directly elected from single-member districts in the [[1988 South Korean legislative election|general elections of April 1988]]. Under applicable laws, the remaining seventy-five representatives were elected from party lists. By law, candidates for election to the assembly must be at least thirty years of age. As part of a political compromise in 1987, an earlier requirement that candidates have at least five years' continuous residency in the country was dropped to allow [[Kim Dae-Jung]], who had spent several years in exile in [[Japan]] and the [[United States]] during the 1980s, to return to political life. The National Assembly's term is four years. In a change from the more authoritarian [[Fourth Republic of South Korea|Fourth Republic]] and [[Fifth Republic of South Korea|Fifth Republic]] (1972\u201380 and 1980\u201387, respectively), under the [[History of South Korea#Sixth Republic 1987\u2013present|Sixth Republic]], the assembly cannot be dissolved by the president.\n\n==Current composition==\n[[File:Graph of South Korean Political Parties (2005-2018).png|thumb|right|This graph traces the recent origins of all six main political parties currently in the Republic of Korea.

Under the second and third constitutions, the National Assembly became bicameral and consisted of the [[House of Commons (South Korea)|House of Commons]] and the [[Senate (South Korea)|Senate]], but actually unicameral with the House of Commons because the House of Commons could not pass a bill to establish the Senate.\n\n{{legend2|{{Conservative (South Korea)/meta/color}}|Conservative|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend2|{{Liberal (South Korea)/meta/color}}|Liberal|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend2|{{Progressive (South Korea)/meta/color}}|Progressive|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n\n{{legend2|lightgreen|majority|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend2|lightyellow|plurality only|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend2|lightpink|largest minority|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:96%; text-align:center;\"\n!

[[Legislative elections in South Korea|Elections to the National Assembly]] are held every four years. The latest [[2020 South Korean legislative election|legislative elections]] were held on 15 April 2020. Single-member constituencies comprise 253 of the assembly's seats, while the remaining 47 are allocated by [[proportional representation]], 30 of which are used to compensate for the Single-member constituencies. Members serve four-year terms.\n\nThe unicameral assembly consists of at least 200 members according to the [[Constitution of South Korea|South Korean constitution]]. In 1990 the assembly had 299 seats, 224 of which were directly elected from single-member districts in the [[1988 South Korean legislative election|general elections of April 1988]]. Under applicable laws, the remaining seventy-five representatives were elected from party lists. By law, candidates for election to the assembly must be at least thirty years of age. As part of a political compromise in 1987, an earlier requirement that candidates have at least five years' continuous residency in the country was dropped to allow [[Kim Dae-Jung]], who had spent several years in exile in [[Japan]] and the [[United States]] during the 1980s, to return to political life. The National Assembly's term is four years. In a change from the more authoritarian [[Fourth Republic of South Korea|Fourth Republic]] and [[Fifth Republic of South Korea|Fifth Republic]] (1972\u201380 and 1980\u201387, respectively), under the [[History of South Korea#Sixth Republic 1987\u2013present|Sixth Republic]], the assembly cannot be dissolved by the president.\n\n==Current composition==\n[[File:Graph of South Korean Political Parties (2005-2018).png|thumb|right|This graph traces the recent origins of all six main political parties currently in the Republic of Korea.

Major and record river flooding occurred primarily in northeastern [[Oklahoma]], and the elevated flows continued downstream into [[Arkansas]] where the caused additional inundation. Antecedent soil moisture levels and water levels in lakes and streams were already high from previous rains, priming the region for significant runoff and flooding. The prolonged combination of high atmospheric moisture and a sustained weather pattern extending across the [[continental United States]] led to frequent high-yield rainfall over the Arkansas River watershed. The overarching weather pattern allowed moisture levels to quickly rebound after each sequential rainfall episode. With soils already saturated, the excess precipitation became [[surface runoff]] and flowed into the already elevated lakes and streams. Most rainfall occurred in connection with a series of [[Tornado outbreak sequence of May 2019|repeated thunderstorms]] between May&nbsp;19\u201321, which was then followed by additional rains that kept streams within [[flood stage]].\n\nFlooding in the Arkansas River basin caused an estimated $3&nbsp;billion in damage and killed five people. The initial episode of torrential rainfall prompted the issuance of two [[flash flood warning|flash flood emergencies]] for several counties in eastern Oklahoma on May&nbsp;20, with numerous water rescues occurring during the event. Several reservoirs in eastern Oklahoma filled over capacity and reached record levels, requiring large releases of water to alleviate the dangerously high storage of water. Repeated rains continued to keep the reservoirs filled, necessitating further releases of water. The prolonged release of reservoir water combined with surface runoff to cause near-record to record flooding along the Arkansas River. Parts of the [[Tulsa metropolitan area]] and entire towns near swollen rivers were inundated. In some locations the Arkansas River backed upstream into its tributaries, causing major flooding. The bulge of elevated water levels that began in Oklahoma flowed downstream into Arkansas by May&nbsp;23, breaching three levees along the Arkansas River and inundating numerous buildings. In [[Van Buren, Arkansas|Van Buren]], the flood was assessed by the [[United States Geological Survey]] as a [[return period|1 in 200 year flood event]].{{#tag:ref|The return period refers to the probability of a given flood peak occurring over a period of time.

Major and record river flooding occurred primarily in northeastern [[Oklahoma]], and the elevated flows continued downstream into [[Arkansas]] where the caused additional inundation. Antecedent soil moisture levels and water levels in lakes and streams were already high from previous rains, priming the region for significant runoff and flooding. The prolonged combination of high atmospheric moisture and a sustained weather pattern extending across the [[continental United States]] led to frequent high-yield rainfall over the Arkansas River watershed. The overarching weather pattern allowed moisture levels to quickly rebound after each sequential rainfall episode. With soils already saturated, the excess precipitation became [[surface runoff]] and flowed into the already elevated lakes and streams. Most rainfall occurred in connection with a series of [[Tornado outbreak sequence of May 2019|repeated thunderstorms]] between May&nbsp;19\u201321, which was then followed by additional rains that kept streams within [[flood stage]].\n\nFlooding in the Arkansas River basin caused an estimated $3&nbsp;billion in damage and killed five people. The initial episode of torrential rainfall prompted the issuance of two [[flash flood warning|flash flood emergencies]] for several counties in eastern Oklahoma on May&nbsp;20, with numerous water rescues occurring during the event. Several reservoirs in eastern Oklahoma filled over capacity and reached record levels, requiring large releases of water to alleviate the dangerously high storage of water. Repeated rains continued to keep the reservoirs filled, necessitating further releases of water. The prolonged release of reservoir water combined with surface runoff to cause near-record to record flooding along the Arkansas River. Parts of the [[Tulsa metropolitan area]] and entire towns near swollen rivers were inundated. In some locations the Arkansas River backed upstream into its tributaries, causing major flooding. The bulge of elevated water levels that began in Oklahoma flowed downstream into Arkansas by May&nbsp;23, breaching three levees along the Arkansas River and inundating numerous buildings. In [[Van Buren, Arkansas|Van Buren]], the flood was assessed by the [[United States Geological Survey]] as a [[return period|1 in 200 year flood event]].{{#tag:ref|The return period refers to the probability of a given flood peak occurring over a period of time.
