{"title_page": "Complexity class", "text_new": "[[Image:Complexity subsets pspace.svg|thumb|right|A representation of the relation among several important complexity classes]]\nIn [[computational complexity theory]], a '''complexity class''' is a set of [[Computational problem|problems]] of related resource-based [[computational complexity|complexity]]. The two most common resources considered are [[time complexity|time]] and [[space complexity|memory]]. A typical complexity class has a definition of the form:\n\n:the set of problems that can be solved by an [[abstract machine]] M using [[Big O notation|O]](f(''n'')) of [[computational resource|resource]] R, where ''n'' is the size of the input.\n\n==Background==\n\nComplexity classes are concerned with the rate of growth of the requirement in resources as the input size ''n'' increases. It is an abstract measurement, and does not give time or space in requirements in terms of seconds or bytes, which would require knowledge of implementation specifics. The function inside the O(...) expression could be a constant, for [[algorithm]]s which are unaffected by the size of ''n'', or an expression involving a [[logarithm]], an expression involving a power of ''n'', i.e. a [[polynomial]] expression, and many others. The O is read as \"order of..\". For the purposes of computational complexity theory, some of the details of the function can be ignored, for instance many possible polynomials can be grouped together as a class.\n\nThe resource in question can either be time, essentially the number of primitive operations on an abstract machine, or (storage) space. For example, the class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' is the set of [[decision problem]]s whose solutions can be determined by a [[non-deterministic Turing machine]] in [[polynomial time]], while the class '''[[PSPACE]]''' is the set of decision problems that can be solved by a [[deterministic Turing machine]] in [[polynomial space]].\n\n===Characterization===\n\nThe simplest complexity classes are defined by the type of computational problem, the model of computation, and the resource (or resources) that are being bounded and the bounds.  The resource and bounds are usually stated together, such as \"polynomial time\", \"logarithmic space\", \"constant depth\", etc.\n\nMany complexity classes can be characterized in terms of the [[mathematical logic]] needed to express them; see [[descriptive complexity]].\n\n====Computational problem====\n\nThe most commonly used problems are [[decision problem]]s. However, complexity classes can be defined based on [[function problem]]s (an example is '''[[FP (complexity)|FP]]'''), [[counting problem (complexity)|counting problem]]s (e.g. '''[[Sharp-P|#P]]'''), [[optimization problem]]s, [[promise problem]]s, etc.\n\n====Model of computation====\n\nThe most common model of computation is the [[deterministic Turing machine]], but many complexity classes are based on [[nondeterministic Turing machine]]s, [[boolean circuit]]s, [[quantum Turing machine]]s, [[monotone circuit]]s, etc.\n\n====Resource bounds====\n\nBounding the computation time above by some concrete function ''f''(''n'') often yields complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model. For instance, the language {''xx'' | ''x'' is any binary string} can be solved in [[linear time]] on a multi-tape Turing machine, but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single-tape Turing machines. If we allow polynomial variations in running time, [[Cobham's thesis|Cobham\u2013Edmonds thesis]] states that \"the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related\" {{Harv|Goldreich|2008|loc=Chapter 1.2}}. This forms the basis for the complexity class '''[[P (complexity)|P]]''', which is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within polynomial time. The corresponding set of function problems is '''[[FP (complexity)|FP]]'''.\n\nThe [[Blum axioms]] can be used to define complexity classes without referring to a concrete [[computational model]].\n\n==Common complexity classes==\n{{Main|List of complexity classes}}\n\n'''[[ALL (complexity)|ALL]]''' is the class of all [[decision problem]]s. Many important complexity classes can be defined by bounding the [[Time complexity|time]] or [[Space complexity|space]] used by the algorithm. Some important complexity classes of decision problems defined in this manner are the following:\n\n===Time-complexity classes===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n\n! Model of computation\n!

In particular,\n* The classes '''[[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]]''', '''[[PP (complexity)|PP]]''', '''[[RP (complexity)|RP]]''', and '''[[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]]''' are defined using the [[probabilistic Turing machine]]\n* The classes '''[[IP (complexity)|IP]]''', '''[[MA (complexity)|MA]]''', and '''[[AM (complexity)|AM]]''' are defined using the [[interactive proof system]]\n* The class '''[[P/poly]]''' and its subclasses '''[[NC (complexity)|NC]]''' and '''[[AC (complexity)|AC]]''' are defined using the [[boolean circuit]]\n* The classes '''[[BQP]]''' and '''[[QMA]]''' are defined using the [[quantum Turing machine]]\n\nThese are explained in greater detail below.\n\n====Randomized computation====\n{{Main|Probabilistic Turing machine}}\n\nA number of important complexity classes are defined using the ''[[probabilistic Turing machine]]'', a variant of the [[Turing machine]] that can toss random coins. These classes help to better describe the complexity of [[randomized algorithm]]s.\n\nUnlike with standard Turing machines, the definition of a probabilistic Turing machine introduces the potential for error; that is, strings that the Turing machine is meant to accept may on some occasions be rejected and strings that the Turing machine is meant to reject may on some occasions be accepted. As a result, the complexity classes based on the probabilistic Turing machine are defined in large part around the amount of error that is allowed. In particular, they are defined using an ''error probability'' <math>\\epsilon</math>: a probabilistic Turing machine <math>M</math> is said to recognize a language <math>L</math> with error probability <math>\\epsilon</math> if:\n# a string <math>w</math> in <math>L</math> implies that <math>\\text{Pr}[M \\text{ accepts } w] \\geq 1 - \\epsilon</math>\n# a string <math>w</math> not in <math>L</math> implies that <math>\\text{Pr}[M \\text{ rejects } w] \\geq 1 - \\epsilon</math>\n\n[[File:Randomized Complexity Classes.svg|thumb|The relationships between the fundamental probabilistic complexity classes. BQP is a probabilistic quantum complexity class and is described in the quantum computing section.]]\nA straightforward class based upon this definition is '''[[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]]''' (zero-error probabilistic polynomial time), the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by a probabilistic Turing machine with error probability 0. Intuitively, this is the strictest class of probabilistic problems because it demands ''no error whatsoever''. \n\nA slightly looser class is '''[[RP (complexity)|RP]]''' (randomized polynomial time), which maintains no error for strings not in the language but allows bounded error for strings in the language. More formally, a language is in '''RP''' if there is a probabilistic polynomial-time Turing machine <math>M</math> such that if a string is not in the language then <math>M</math> always rejects and if a string is in the language then <math>M</math> accepts with a probability at least 1/2. The class '''co-RP''' is similarly defined except the roles are flipped: error is not allowed for strings in the language but is allowed for strings not in the language. Taken together, the classes '''RP''' and '''co-RP''' encompass all of the problems that can be solved by probabilistic Turing machines with [[one-sided error]]. \n\nLoosening the error requirements further to allow for [[two-sided error]] yields the class '''[[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]]''' (bounded-error probabilistic polynomial time), the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by a probabilistic Turing machine with error probability less than 1/3 (for both strings in the language and not in the language). '''BPP''' is the most practically relevant of the probabilistic complexity classes\u2014most problems of interest in '''BPP''' have efficient [[randomized algorithm]]s that can be run quickly on real computers. '''BPP''' is also at the center of the important unsolved problem in computer science over whether '''[[BPP (complexity)#Problems|P=BPP]]''', which if true would mean that randomness does not increase the computational power of computers, i.e. any probabilistic Turing machine could be simulated by a deterministic Turing machine with at most polynomial slowdown. \n\nThe broadest class of efficiently-solvable probabilistic problems is '''[[PP (complexity)|PP]]''' (probabilistic polynomial time), the set of languages solvable by a probabilistic Turing machine in polynomial time with an error probability of less than 1/2 for all strings.\n\n'''ZPP''', '''RP''' and '''co-RP''' are all subsets of '''BPP'''. The reason for this is intuitive: the classes allowing zero error and only one-sided error are all contained within the class that allows for two-sided error. '''BPP''' is a subset of '''PP'''. '''ZPP''' relates to '''RP''' and '''co-RP''' in the following way: '''ZPP'''<math>=</math>'''RP'''<math>\\cap</math>'''co-RP''', that is, '''ZPP''' consists exactly of those problems that are in both '''RP''' and '''co-RP'''. Intuitively, this follows from the fact that '''RP''' and '''co-RP''' allow only one-sided error. A problem in '''RP''' allows error only for strings in the language, and a problem in '''co-RP''' allows error only for strings not in the language, i.e. it disallows error for strings in the language. Hence, if a problem is in both '''RP''' and '''co-RP''', then there must be no error for strings in the language. A similar argument further demonstrates that no error is allowed for strings not in the language. Together, this means that no error is allowed whatsoever, which is exactly the definition of '''ZPP'''.\n\n====Interactive  proof systems====\n{{Main|Interactive proof system}}\nA number of complexity classes are defined using ''interactive proof systems''. Interactive proofs generalize the proofs definition of the complexity class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' and yield insights into [[cryptography]], [[approximation algorithm]]s, and [[formal verification]].\n\n[[File:Interactive proof (complexity).svg|thumb|300px|General representation of an interactive proof protocol.]]\nInteractive proof systems are [[abstract machine]]s that model computation as the exchange of messages between two parties: a prover <math>P</math> and a verifier <math>V</math>. The parties interact by exchanging messages, and an input string is accepted by the system if the verifier decides to accept the input on the basis of the messages it has received from the prover. The prover <math>P</math> has unlimited computational power while the verifier has bounded computational power (the standard definition of interactive proof systems defines the verifier to be polynomially-time bounded). The prover, however, is untrustworthy (this prevents all languages from being trivially recognized by the proof system by having the computationally unbounded prover determine if a string is in a language and then sending a trustworthy \"YES\" or \"NO\" to the verifier), so the verifier must conduct an \"interrogation\" of the prover by \"asking it\" successive rounds of questions, accepting only if it develops a high degree of confidence that the string is in the language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Arora |first1=Sanjeev |last2=Barak|author1link=Sanjeev Arora |first2=Boaz|author2link=Boaz Barak |title=Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42426-4|page=144|quote=\"The verifier conducts an interrogation of the prover, repeatedly asking questions and listening to the prover's responses.\"}}</ref>\n\nThe class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' is a simple proof system in which the verifier is restricted to being a deterministic, polynomial-time machine and the procedure is restricted to one round (that is, the prover sends only a single, full [[Certificate (complexity)|proof]] to the verifier). Put another way, in the definition of the class '''NP''' (the set of decision problems for which the problem instances, when the answer is \"YES\", have proofs verifiable in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine) is a proof system in which the proof is constructed by an unmentioned prover and the deterministic Turing machine is the verifier. \n\nIt turns out that '''NP''' describes the full power of interactive proof systems with deterministic (polynomial-time) verifiers because, for any proof systems with deterministic verifiers, it is never necessary to need more than a single round of messaging between the prover and the verifier. Interactive proof systems that provide greater computational power over standard complexity classes thus require ''probabilistic verifiers'', which means that the verifiers' questions to provers are computed using [[probabilistic algorithm]]s. As noted in the section above, probabilistic algorithms introduce error into the system, so complexity classes based on probabilistic proof systems are defined in terms of the error probability. \n\nThe most general complexity class arising out of this characterization is the class '''[[IP (complexity)|IP]]''' (interactive polynomial time), which is the class of all problems solvable by an interactive proof system <math>(P,V)</math>, where <math>V</math> is probabilistic polynomial-time and the proof system satisfies two properties: for a language <math>L \\in </math> '''IP'''\n# (Completeness) a string <math>w</math> in <math>L</math> implies <math>\\Pr[V \\text{ accepts }w \\text{ after interacting with } P] \\ge \\tfrac{2}{3}</math>\n# (Soundness) a string <math>w</math> not in <math>L</math> implies <math>\\Pr[V \\text{ accepts }w \\text{ after interacting with } P] \\le \\tfrac{1}{3}</math>\n\nAn important feature of '''IP''' is that it equals '''[[PSPACE]]'''.\n\nA modification of the protocol for '''IP''' produces another important complexity class: '''[[AM (complexity)|AM]]''' (Arthur\u2013Merlin protocol). In the definition of interactive proof systems used by '''IP''', the prover was not able to see the coins utilized by the verifier in its probabilistic computation\u2014it was only able to see the messages that the verifier produced with these coins. For this reason, the coins are called ''private random coins''. The interactive proof system can be constrained so that the coins used by the verifier are ''public random coins'', that is the prover is able to see the coins. Formally, '''AM''' is defined as the class of languages with an interactive proof in which the verifier sends a random string to the prover, the prover responds with a message, and the verifier either accepts or rejects by applying a deterministic polynomial-time function to the message from the prover. '''AM''' can be generalized to '''AM'''[k], where k is the number of messages exchanged (so in the generalized form the standard '''AM''' defined above is '''AM'''[2]). However, it is the case that for all k<math>\\geq</math>2, '''AM'''[k]='''AM'''[2]. It is also the case that '''AM'''[k]<math>\\subseteq</math>'''IP'''[k].\n\nOther complexity classes defined using interactive proof systems include '''[[Interactive proof system#MIP|MIP]]''' (mutliprover interactive polynomial time) and '''[[QIP (complexity)|QIP]]''' (quantum interactive polynomial time).\n\n====Boolean circuits====\n{{Main|Circuit complexity}}\n[[File:Three_input_Boolean_circuit.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Example Boolean circuit computing the Boolean function <math>f_C(x_1,x_2,x_3)</math>, where <math>x_1=0</math>, <math>x_2=1</math>, and <math>x_3=0</math>. The <math>\\wedge</math> nodes are [[AND gate]]s, the <math>\\vee</math> nodes are [[OR gate]]s, and the <math>\\neg</math> nodes are [[NOT gate]]s]]\nAn alternative model of computation to the [[Turing machine]] is the ''[[Boolean circuit]]'', a simplified model of the [[digital circuit]]s used in modern [[computer]]s. Not only does this model provide a more intuitive connection between computation in theory and computation in practice, but it is also a natural model for [[non-uniform computation]] (different input sizes within the same problem use different algorithms) that leads to a number of new complexity classes.\n\nFormally, a Boolean circuit <math>C</math> is a [[directed acyclic graph]] in which edges represent ''wires'' (which carry the [[bit]] values 0 and 1), the input bits are represented by ''source vertices'' (vertices with no incoming edges), and all non-source vertices represent ''[[logic gate]]s'' (generally the [[AND gate|AND]], [[OR gate|OR]], and [[NOT gate]]s). One logic gate is designated the ''output gate'', and represents the end of the computation. The input/output behavior of a circuit <math>C</math> with <math>n</math> input variables is represented by the [[Boolean function]] <math>f_C:\\{0,1\\}^n \\to \\{0,1\\}</math>; for example, on input bits <math>x_1,x_2,...,x_n</math>, the output bit <math>b</math> of the circuit is represented mathematically as <math>b = f_C(x_1,x_2,...,x_n)</math>. The circuit <math>C</math> is said to ''compute'' the Boolean function <math>f_C</math>.\n\nA particular circuit only acts on inputs of fixed size. [[Formal language|Languages]] (the formal representation of [[decision problem]]s), however, contain strings of different lengths, so languages cannot be fully captured by a single circuit (in contrast to the Turing machine model, in which a language is fully described by a single Turing machine). A language is instead represented by a ''circuit family''. A circuit family is an infinite list of circuits <math>(C_0,C_1,C_2,...)</math>, where <math>C_n</math> has <math>n</math> input variables. A circuit family is said to decide a language <math>L</math> if, for every string <math>w</math>, <math>w</math> is in the language <math>L</math> if and only if <math>C_n(w)=1</math>, where <math>n</math> is the length of <math>w</math>. In other words, a language is the set of strings which, when applied to the circuits corresponding to their lengths, evaluate to 1.\n\nWhile complexity classes defined using Turing machines are described in terms of [[time complexity]], circuit complexity classes are defined in terms of circuit size. The size of a circuit is the number of vertices in it. The size complexity of a circuit family <math>(C_0,C_1,...)</math> is the function <math>f:\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}</math>, where <math>f(n)</math> is the circuit size of <math>C_n</math>. The familiar function classes follow naturally from this; for example, a polynomial-size complexity is one such that the function <math>f</math> is a [[polynomial]].\n\nThis leads directly to the complexity class '''[[P/poly]]''', the set of languages that are decidable by polynomial-size circuit families. It turns out that there is a natural connection between circuit complexity and time complexity. Intuitively, a language with small time complexity (requires relatively few sequential operations on a Turing machine), also has a small circuit complexity (requires relatively few Boolean operations). Formally, it can be shown that if a language is in <math>\\mathsf{TIME}(t(n))</math>, where <math>t</math> is a function <math>t:\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}</math>, then it has circuit complexity <math>O(t^2(n))</math>.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Sipser|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Course Technology|location=USA|isbn=978-0-534-95097-2|title-link=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|page=355}}</ref> It follows directly from this that '''[[P]]'''<math>\\subseteq</math>'''P/poly'''. In other words, any problem that can be computed in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine can also be computed by a polynomial-size circuit family. It is further the case that the inclusion is proper ('''P'''<math>\\subset</math>'''P/poly''') because there are undecidable problems that are in '''P/poly'''.\n\n'''P/poly''' turns out to have a number of properties that make it highly useful in the study of the relationships between complexity classes. In particular, it is helpful in investigating problems related to [[P versus NP|'''P''' versus '''NP''']]. For example, if there is any language in '''NP''' that is not in '''P/poly''', then '''P'''<math>\\neq</math>'''NP'''.<ref>Arora and Barak p. 286</ref> '''P/poly''' also helps to investigate properties of the [[polynomial hierarchy]]. For example, if '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' \u2286 '''P/poly''', then '''PH''' collapses to <math>\\Sigma_2^{\\mathsf P}</math>. A full description of the relations between '''P/poly''' and other complexity classes is available at \"[[P/poly#Importance of P/poly|Importance of P/poly]]\". '''P/poly''' also has the interesting feature that it can be equivalently defined as the class of languages recognized by a polynomial-time Turing machine with a polynomial-bounded [[advice (complexity)|advice function]].\n\nTwo subclasses of '''P/poly''' that have interesting properties in their own right are '''[[NC (complexity)|NC]]''' and '''[[AC (complexity)|AC]]'''. These classes are defined not only in terms of their circuit size but also in terms of their ''depth''. The depth of a circuit is the length of the longest [[directed path]] from an input node to the output node. The class '''NC''' is the set of languages that can be solved by circuit families that are restricted not only to having polynomial-size but also to having ''polylogarithmic depth''. The class '''AC''' is defined similarly to '''NC''', however gates are allowed to have unbounded fan-in (that is, the AND and OR gates can be applied to more than two bits). '''NC''' is an important class because it turns out that it represents the class of languages that have efficient ''[[parallel algorithm]]s''.\n\n====Quantum Turing machines====\n\nThe classes '''[[BQP]]''' and '''[[QMA]]''', which are of key importance in [[quantum information science]], are defined using [[quantum Turing machine]]s.\n\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\n\n====Counting problems====\n\n'''[[Sharp-P|#P]]''' is an important complexity class of counting problems (not decision problems).\n\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Enumeration algorithms===\n\nSeveral [[output-sensitive algorithm|output-sensitive]] classes have been defined for [[enumeration algorithm]]s.\n\n{{expand section|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Reduction==\n{{main article|Reduction (complexity)}}\nMany complexity classes are defined using the concept of a reduction. A reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem. It captures the informal notion of a problem being at least as difficult as another problem. For instance, if a problem ''X'' can be solved using an algorithm for ''Y'', ''X'' is no more difficult than ''Y'', and we say that ''X'' ''reduces'' to ''Y''. There are many different types of reductions, based on the method of reduction, such as [[Cook reduction]]s, [[Karp reduction]]s and [[Levin reduction]]s, and the bound on the complexity of reductions, such as [[polynomial-time reduction]]s or [[log-space reduction]]s.\n\nThe most commonly used reduction is a polynomial-time reduction. This means that the reduction process takes polynomial time. For example, the problem of squaring an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers. This means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer. Indeed, this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm. Thus we see that squaring is not more difficult than multiplication, since squaring can be reduced to multiplication.\n\nThis motivates the concept of a problem being hard for a complexity class. A problem ''X'' is ''hard'' for a class of problems '''C''' if every problem in '''C''' can be reduced to ''X''. Thus no problem in '''C''' is harder than ''X'', since an algorithm for ''X'' allows us to solve any problem in '''C'''. Of course, the notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used. For complexity classes larger than '''P''', polynomial-time reductions are commonly used. In particular, the set of problems that are hard for '''NP''' is the set of '''[[NP-hard]]''' problems.\n\nIf a problem ''X'' is in '''C''' and is hard for '''C''', then ''X'' is said to be ''[[complete (complexity)|complete]]'' for '''C'''. This means that ''X'' is the hardest problem in '''C''' (Since there could be many problems which are equally hard, one might say that ''X'' is one of the hardest problems in '''C'''). Thus the class of [[NP-complete|'''NP'''-complete]] problems contains the most difficult problems in '''NP''', in the sense that they are the ones most likely not to be in P. Because the problem '''P'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''NP''' is not solved, being able to reduce a known '''NP'''-complete problem, \u03a0<sub>2</sub>, to another problem, \u03a0<sub>1</sub>, would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for \u03a0<sub>1</sub>.  This is because a polynomial-time solution to \u03a0<sub>1</sub> would yield a polynomial-time solution to \u03a0<sub>2</sub>. Similarly, because all '''NP''' problems can be reduced to the set, finding an '''NP'''-complete problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that '''P'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''NP'''.\n\n==Closure properties of classes==\nComplexity classes have a variety of closure properties; for example, decision classes may be closed under [[negation]], [[disjunction]], [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]], or even under all [[Logical connective|Boolean operations]]. Moreover, they might also be closed under a variety of quantification schemes. '''P''', for instance, is closed under all Boolean operations, and under quantification over polynomially sized domains. However, it is most likely not closed under quantification over exponential sized domains.\n\nEach class '''X''' that is not closed under negation has a complement class '''co-Y''', which consists of the complements of the languages contained in '''X'''. Similarly one can define the Boolean closure of a class, and so on; this is however less commonly done.\n\nOne possible route to separating two complexity classes is to find some closure property possessed by one and not by the other.\n\n==Relationships between complexity classes==\n\n===Savitch's theorem===\n{{Main|Savitch's theorem}}\nSavitch's theorem establishes that '''PSPACE''' = '''NPSPACE''' and '''EXPSPACE''' = '''NEXPSPACE'''. One central question of complexity theory is whether nondeterminism adds significant power to a computational model. This is central to the open '''P''' versus '''NP''' problem in the context of time. Savitch's theorem shows that for space, nondeterminism does not add significantly more power, where \"significant\" means the difference between polynomial and superpolynomial resource requirements (or, for '''EXPSPACE''', the difference between exponential and superexponential). For example, Savitch's theorem proves that no problem that requires exponential space for a deterministic Turing machine can be solved by a nondeterministic polynomial space Turing machine.\n\n===Other relations===\n\nThe following table shows some of the classes of problems (or languages, or grammars) that are considered in complexity theory.  If class '''X''' is a strict [[subset]] of '''Y''', then '''X''' is shown below '''Y''', with a dark line connecting them.  If '''X''' is a subset, but it is unknown whether they are equal sets, then the line is lighter and is dotted.  Technically, the breakdown into decidable and undecidable pertains more to the study of [[computability theory]] but is useful for putting the complexity classes in perspective.\n{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=2 |\n\n| colspan=4 |\n{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"background:lightBlue;

In particular, although '''DTIME'''(''n'') is contained in '''DTIME'''(''n''<sup>2</sup>), it would be interesting to know if the inclusion is strict. For time and space requirements, the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively. They are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources. Thus there are pairs of complexity classes such that one is properly included in the other. Having deduced such proper set inclusions, we can proceed to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is needed in order to increase the number of problems that can be solved.\n\nMore precisely, the [[time hierarchy theorem]] states that\n:<math>\\mathbf{DTIME}\\big(f(n) \\big) \\subsetneq \\mathbf{DTIME} \\big(f(n) \\sdot \\log^{2}(f(n)) \\big)</math>.\n\nThe [[space hierarchy theorem]] states that\n:<math>\\mathbf{DSPACE}\\big(f(n)\\big) \\subsetneq \\mathbf{DSPACE} \\big(f(n) \\sdot \\log(f(n)) \\big)</math>.\n\nThe time and space hierarchy theorems form the basis for most separation results of complexity classes. For instance, the time hierarchy theorem tells us that '''P''' is strictly contained in '''EXPTIME''', and the space hierarchy theorem tells us that '''L''' is strictly contained in '''PSPACE'''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of complexity classes]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Arora |first1=Sanjeev |last2=Barak|author1link=Sanjeev Arora |first2=Boaz|author2link=Boaz Barak |title=Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42426-4}}\n* {{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Sipser|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Course Technology|location=USA|isbn=978-0-534-95097-2|title-link=Introduction to the Theory of Computation}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo The Complexity Zoo]: A huge list of complexity classes, a reference for experts.\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.umass.edu/~immerman/complexity_theory.html |author=[[Neil Immerman]] |title=Computational Complexity Theory |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416021243/https://people.cs.umass.edu/~immerman/complexity_theory.html |archivedate=2016-04-16}} Includes a diagram showing the hierarchy of complexity classes and how they fit together.\n*[[Michael Garey]], and [[David S.

The two most common resources considered are [[time complexity|time]] and [[space complexity|memory]]. A typical complexity class has a definition of the form:\n\n:the set of problems that can be solved by an [[abstract machine]] M using [[Big O notation|O]](f(''n'')) of [[computational resource|resource]] R, where ''n'' is the size of the input.\n\n==Background==\n\nComplexity classes are concerned with the rate of growth of the requirement in resources as the input size ''n'' increases. It is an abstract measurement, and does not give time or space in requirements in terms of seconds or bytes, which would require knowledge of implementation specifics. The function inside the O(...) expression could be a constant, for [[algorithm]]s which are unaffected by the size of ''n'', or an expression involving a [[logarithm]], an expression involving a power of ''n'', i.e. a [[polynomial]] expression, and many others. The O is read as \"order of..\". For the purposes of computational complexity theory, some of the details of the function can be ignored, for instance many possible polynomials can be grouped together as a class.\n\nThe resource in question can either be time, essentially the number of primitive operations on an abstract machine, or (storage) space. For example, the class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' is the set of [[decision problem]]s whose solutions can be determined by a [[non-deterministic Turing machine]] in [[polynomial time]], while the class '''[[PSPACE]]''' is the set of decision problems that can be solved by a [[deterministic Turing machine]] in [[polynomial space]].\n\n===Characterization===\n\nThe simplest complexity classes are defined by the type of computational problem, the model of computation, and the resource (or resources) that are being bounded and the bounds.  The resource and bounds are usually stated together, such as \"polynomial time\", \"logarithmic space\", \"constant depth\", etc.\n\nMany complexity classes can be characterized in terms of the [[mathematical logic]] needed to express them; see [[descriptive complexity]].\n\n====Computational problem====\n\nThe most commonly used problems are [[decision problem]]s. However, complexity classes can be defined based on [[function problem]]s (an example is '''[[FP (complexity)|FP]]'''), [[counting problem (complexity)|counting problem]]s (e.g. '''[[Sharp-P|#P]]'''), [[optimization problem]]s, [[promise problem]]s, etc.\n\n====Model of computation====\n\nThe most common model of computation is the [[deterministic Turing machine]], but many complexity classes are based on [[nondeterministic Turing machine]]s, [[boolean circuit]]s, [[quantum Turing machine]]s, [[monotone circuit]]s, etc.\n\n====Resource bounds====\n\nBounding the computation time above by some concrete function ''f''(''n'') often yields complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model. For instance, the language {''xx'' | ''x'' is any binary string} can be solved in [[linear time]] on a multi-tape Turing machine, but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single-tape Turing machines. If we allow polynomial variations in running time, [[Cobham's thesis|Cobham\u2013Edmonds thesis]] states that \"the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related\" {{Harv|Goldreich|2008|loc=Chapter 1.2}}. This forms the basis for the complexity class '''[[P (complexity)|P]]''', which is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within polynomial time. The corresponding set of function problems is '''[[FP (complexity)|FP]]'''.\n\nThe [[Blum axioms]] can be used to define complexity classes without referring to a concrete [[computational model]].\n\n==Common complexity classes==\n{{Main|List of complexity classes}}\n\n'''[[ALL (complexity)|ALL]]''' is the class of all [[decision problem]]s. Many important complexity classes can be defined by bounding the [[Time complexity|time]] or [[Space complexity|space]] used by the algorithm. Some important complexity classes of decision problems defined in this manner are the following:\n\n===Time-complexity classes===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n\n! Model of computation\n!

In particular,\n* The classes '''[[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]]''', '''[[PP (complexity)|PP]]''', '''[[RP (complexity)|RP]]''', and '''[[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]]''' are defined using the [[probabilistic Turing machine]]\n* The classes '''[[IP (complexity)|IP]]''', '''[[MA (complexity)|MA]]''', and '''[[AM (complexity)|AM]]''' are defined using the [[interactive proof system]]\n* The class '''[[P/poly]]''' and its subclasses '''[[NC (complexity)|NC]]''' and '''[[AC (complexity)|AC]]''' are defined using the [[boolean circuit]]\n* The classes '''[[BQP]]''' and '''[[QMA]]''' are defined using the [[quantum Turing machine]]\n\nThese are explained in greater detail below.\n\n====Randomized computation====\n{{Main|Probabilistic Turing machine}}\n\nA number of important complexity classes are defined using the ''[[probabilistic Turing machine]]'', a variant of the [[Turing machine]] that can toss random coins. These classes help to better describe the complexity of [[randomized algorithm]]s.\n\nUnlike with standard Turing machines, the definition of a probabilistic Turing machine introduces the potential for error; that is, strings that the Turing machine is meant to accept may on some occasions be rejected and strings that the Turing machine is meant to reject may on some occasions be accepted. As a result, the complexity classes based on the probabilistic Turing machine are defined in large part around the amount of error that is allowed. In particular, they are defined using an ''error probability'' <math>\\epsilon</math>: a probabilistic Turing machine <math>M</math> is said to recognize a language <math>L</math> with error probability <math>\\epsilon</math> if:\n# a string <math>w</math> in <math>L</math> implies that <math>\\text{Pr}[M \\text{ accepts } w] \\geq 1 - \\epsilon</math>\n# a string <math>w</math> not in <math>L</math> implies that <math>\\text{Pr}[M \\text{ rejects } w] \\geq 1 - \\epsilon</math>\n\n[[File:Randomized Complexity Classes.svg|thumb|The relationships between the fundamental probabilistic complexity classes. BQP is a quantum complexity class and is described in the quantum computing section.]]\nA straightforward class based upon this definition is '''[[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]]''' (zero-error probabilistic polynomial time), the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by a probabilistic Turing machine with error probability 0. Intuitively, this is the strictest class of probabilistic problems because it demands ''no error whatsoever''. \n\nA slightly looser class is '''[[RP (complexity)|RP]]''' (randomized polynomial time), which maintains no error for strings not in the language but allows bounded error for strings in the language. More formally, a language is in '''RP''' if there is a probabilistic polynomial-time Turing machine <math>M</math> such that if a string is not in the language then <math>M</math> always rejects and if a string is in the language then <math>M</math> accepts with a probability at least 1/2. The class '''co-RP''' is similarly defined except the roles are flipped: error is not allowed for strings in the language but is allowed for strings not in the language. Taken together, the classes '''RP''' and '''co-RP''' encompass all of the problems that can be solved by probabilistic Turing machines with [[one-sided error]]. \n\nLoosening the error requirements further to allow for [[two-sided error]] yields the class '''[[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]]''' (bounded-error probabilistic polynomial time), the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by a probabilistic Turing machine with error probability less than 1/3 (for both strings in the language and not in the language). '''BPP''' is the most practically relevant of the probabilistic complexity classes\u2014most problems of interest in '''BPP''' have efficient [[randomized algorithm]]s that can be run quickly on real computers. '''BPP''' is also at the center of the important unsolved problem in computer science over whether '''[[BPP (complexity)#Problems|P=BPP]]''', which if true would mean that randomness does not increase the computational power of computers, i.e. any probabilistic Turing machine could be simulated by a deterministic Turing machine with at most polynomial slowdown. \n\nThe broadest class of efficiently-solvable probabilistic problems is '''[[PP (complexity)|PP]]''' (probabilistic polynomial time), the set of languages solvable by a probabilistic Turing machine in polynomial time with an error probability of less than 1/2 for all strings.\n\n'''ZPP''', '''RP''' and '''co-RP''' are all subsets of '''BPP'''. The reason for this is intuitive: the classes allowing zero error and only one-sided error are all contained within the class that allows for two-sided error. '''BPP''' is a subset of '''PP'''. '''ZPP''' relates to '''RP''' and '''co-RP''' in the following way: '''ZPP'''<math>=</math>'''RP'''<math>\\cap</math>'''co-RP''', that is, '''ZPP''' consists exactly of those problems that are in both '''RP''' and '''co-RP'''. Intuitively, this follows from the fact that '''RP''' and '''co-RP''' allow only one-sided error. A problem in '''RP''' allows error only for strings in the language, and a problem in '''co-RP''' allows error only for strings not in the language, i.e. it disallows error for strings in the language. Hence, if a problem is in both '''RP''' and '''co-RP''', then there must be no error for strings in the language. A similar argument further demonstrates that no error is allowed for strings not in the language. Together, this means that no error is allowed whatsoever, which is exactly the definition of '''ZPP'''.\n\n====Interactive  proof systems====\n{{Main|Interactive proof system}}\nA number of complexity classes are defined using ''interactive proof systems''. Interactive proofs generalize the proofs definition of the complexity class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' and yield insights into [[cryptography]], [[approximation algorithm]]s, and [[formal verification]].\n\n[[File:Interactive proof (complexity).svg|thumb|300px|General representation of an interactive proof protocol.]]\nInteractive proof systems are [[abstract machine]]s that model computation as the exchange of messages between two parties: a prover <math>P</math> and a verifier <math>V</math>. The parties interact by exchanging messages, and an input string is accepted by the system if the verifier decides to accept the input on the basis of the messages it has received from the prover. The prover <math>P</math> has unlimited computational power while the verifier has bounded computational power (the standard definition of interactive proof systems defines the verifier to be polynomially-time bounded). The prover, however, is untrustworthy (this prevents all languages from being trivially recognized by the proof system by having the computationally unbounded prover determine if a string is in a language and then sending a trustworthy \"YES\" or \"NO\" to the verifier), so the verifier must conduct an \"interrogation\" of the prover by \"asking it\" successive rounds of questions, accepting only if it develops a high degree of confidence that the string is in the language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Arora |first1=Sanjeev |last2=Barak|author1link=Sanjeev Arora |first2=Boaz|author2link=Boaz Barak |title=Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42426-4|page=144|quote=\"The verifier conducts an interrogation of the prover, repeatedly asking questions and listening to the prover's responses.\"}}</ref>\n\nThe class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' is a simple proof system in which the verifier is restricted to being a deterministic, polynomial-time machine and the procedure is restricted to one round (that is, the prover sends only a single, full [[Certificate (complexity)|proof]] to the verifier). Put another way, in the definition of the class '''NP''' (the set of decision problems for which the problem instances, when the answer is \"YES\", have proofs verifiable in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine) is a proof system in which the proof is constructed by an unmentioned prover and the deterministic Turing machine is the verifier. \n\nIt turns out that '''NP''' describes the full power of interactive proof systems with deterministic (polynomial-time) verifiers because, for any proof systems with deterministic verifiers, it is never necessary to need more than a single round of messaging between the prover and the verifier. Interactive proof systems that provide greater computational power over standard complexity classes thus require ''probabilistic verifiers'', which means that the verifiers' questions to provers are computed using [[probabilistic algorithm]]s. As noted in the section above, probabilistic algorithms introduce error into the system, so complexity classes based on probabilistic proof systems are defined in terms of the error probability. \n\nThe most general complexity class arising out of this characterization is the class '''[[IP (complexity)|IP]]''' (interactive polynomial time), which is the class of all problems solvable by an interactive proof system <math>(P,V)</math>, where <math>V</math> is probabilistic polynomial-time and the proof system satisfies two properties: for a language <math>L \\in </math> '''IP'''\n# (Completeness) a string <math>w</math> in <math>L</math> implies <math>\\Pr[V \\text{ accepts }w \\text{ after interacting with } P] \\ge \\tfrac{2}{3}</math>\n# (Soundness) a string <math>w</math> not in <math>L</math> implies <math>\\Pr[V \\text{ accepts }w \\text{ after interacting with } P] \\le \\tfrac{1}{3}</math>\n\nAn important feature of '''IP''' is that it equals '''[[PSPACE]]'''.\n\nA modification of the protocol for '''IP''' produces another important complexity class: '''[[AM (complexity)|AM]]''' (Arthur\u2013Merlin protocol). In the definition of interactive proof systems used by '''IP''', the prover was not able to see the coins utilized by the verifier in its probabilistic computation\u2014it was only able to see the messages that the verifier produced with these coins. For this reason, the coins are called ''private random coins''. The interactive proof system can be constrained so that the coins used by the verifier are ''public random coins'', that is the prover is able to see the coins. Formally, '''AM''' is defined as the class of languages with an interactive proof in which the verifier sends a random string to the prover, the prover responds with a message, and the verifier either accepts or rejects by applying a deterministic polynomial-time function to the message from the prover. '''AM''' can be generalized to '''AM'''[k], where k is the number of messages exchanged (so in the generalized form the standard '''AM''' defined above is '''AM'''[2]). However, it is the case that for all k<math>\\geq</math>2, '''AM'''[k]='''AM'''[2]. It is also the case that '''AM'''[k]<math>\\subseteq</math>'''IP'''[k].\n\nOther complexity classes defined using interactive proof systems include '''[[Interactive proof system#MIP|MIP]]''' (mutliprover interactive polynomial time) and '''[[QIP (complexity)|QIP]]''' (quantum interactive polynomial time).\n\n====Boolean circuits====\n{{Main|Circuit complexity}}\n[[File:Three_input_Boolean_circuit.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Example Boolean circuit computing the Boolean function <math>f_C(x_1,x_2,x_3)</math>, where <math>x_1=0</math>, <math>x_2=1</math>, and <math>x_3=0</math>. The <math>\\wedge</math> nodes are [[AND gate]]s, the <math>\\vee</math> nodes are [[OR gate]]s, and the <math>\\neg</math> nodes are [[NOT gate]]s]]\nAn alternative model of computation to the [[Turing machine]] is the ''[[Boolean circuit]]'', a simplified model of the [[digital circuit]]s used in modern [[computer]]s. Not only does this model provide a more intuitive connection between computation in theory and computation in practice, but it is also a natural model for [[non-uniform computation]] (different input sizes within the same problem use different algorithms) that leads to a number of new complexity classes.\n\nFormally, a Boolean circuit <math>C</math> is a [[directed acyclic graph]] in which edges represent ''wires'' (which carry the [[bit]] values 0 and 1), the input bits are represented by ''source vertices'' (vertices with no incoming edges), and all non-source vertices represent ''[[logic gate]]s'' (generally the [[AND gate|AND]], [[OR gate|OR]], and [[NOT gate]]s). One logic gate is designated the ''output gate'', and represents the end of the computation. The input/output behavior of a circuit <math>C</math> with <math>n</math> input variables is represented by the [[Boolean function]] <math>f_C:\\{0,1\\}^n \\to \\{0,1\\}</math>; for example, on input bits <math>x_1,x_2,...,x_n</math>, the output bit <math>b</math> of the circuit is represented mathematically as <math>b = f_C(x_1,x_2,...,x_n)</math>. The circuit <math>C</math> is said to ''compute'' the Boolean function <math>f_C</math>.\n\nA particular circuit only acts on inputs of fixed size. [[Formal language|Languages]] (the formal representation of [[decision problem]]s), however, contain strings of different lengths, so languages cannot be fully captured by a single circuit (in contrast to the Turing machine model, in which a language is fully described by a single Turing machine). A language is instead represented by a ''circuit family''. A circuit family is an infinite list of circuits <math>(C_0,C_1,C_2,...)</math>, where <math>C_n</math> has <math>n</math> input variables. A circuit family is said to decide a language <math>L</math> if, for every string <math>w</math>, <math>w</math> is in the language <math>L</math> if and only if <math>C_n(w)=1</math>, where <math>n</math> is the length of <math>w</math>. In other words, a language is the set of strings which, when applied to the circuits corresponding to their lengths, evaluate to 1.\n\nWhile complexity classes defined using Turing machines are described in terms of [[time complexity]], circuit complexity classes are defined in terms of circuit size. The size of a circuit is the number of vertices in it. The size complexity of a circuit family <math>(C_0,C_1,...)</math> is the function <math>f:\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}</math>, where <math>f(n)</math> is the circuit size of <math>C_n</math>. The familiar function classes follow naturally from this; for example, a polynomial-size complexity is one such that the function <math>f</math> is a [[polynomial]].\n\nThis leads directly to the complexity class '''[[P/poly]]''', the set of languages that are decidable by polynomial-size circuit families. It turns out that there is a natural connection between circuit complexity and time complexity. Intuitively, a language with small time complexity (requires relatively few sequential operations on a Turing machine), also has a small circuit complexity (requires relatively few Boolean operations). Formally, it can be shown that if a language is in <math>\\mathsf{TIME}(t(n))</math>, where <math>t</math> is a function <math>t:\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}</math>, then it has circuit complexity <math>O(t^2(n))</math>.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Sipser|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Course Technology|location=USA|isbn=978-0-534-95097-2|title-link=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|page=355}}</ref> It follows directly from this that '''[[P]]'''<math>\\subseteq</math>'''P/poly'''. In other words, any problem that can be computed in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine can also be computed by a polynomial-size circuit family. It is further the case that the inclusion is proper ('''P'''<math>\\subset</math>'''P/poly''') because there are undecidable problems that are in '''P/poly'''.\n\n'''P/poly''' turns out to have a number of properties that make it highly useful in the study of the relationships between complexity classes. In particular, it is helpful in investigating problems related to [[P versus NP|'''P''' versus '''NP''']]. For example, if there is any language in '''NP''' that is not in '''P/poly''', then '''P'''<math>\\neq</math>'''NP'''.<ref>Arora and Barak p. 286</ref> '''P/poly''' also helps to investigate properties of the [[polynomial hierarchy]]. For example, if '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' \u2286 '''P/poly''', then '''PH''' collapses to <math>\\Sigma_2^{\\mathsf P}</math>. A full description of the relations between '''P/poly''' and other complexity classes is available at \"[[P/poly#Importance of P/poly|Importance of P/poly]]\". '''P/poly''' also has the interesting feature that it can be equivalently defined as the class of languages recognized by a polynomial-time Turing machine with a polynomial-bounded [[advice (complexity)|advice function]].\n\nTwo subclasses of '''P/poly''' that have interesting properties in their own right are '''[[NC (complexity)|NC]]''' and '''[[AC (complexity)|AC]]'''. These classes are defined not only in terms of their circuit size but also in terms of their ''depth''. The depth of a circuit is the length of the longest [[directed path]] from an input node to the output node. The class '''NC''' is the set of languages that can be solved by circuit families that are restricted not only to having polynomial-size but also to having ''polylogarithmic depth''. The class '''AC''' is defined similarly to '''NC''', however gates are allowed to have unbounded fan-in (that is, the AND and OR gates can be applied to more than two bits). '''NC''' is an important class because it turns out that it represents the class of languages that have efficient ''[[parallel algorithm]]s''.\n\n====Quantum Turing machines====\n\nThe classes '''[[BQP]]''' and '''[[QMA]]''', which are of key importance in [[quantum information science]], are defined using [[quantum Turing machine]]s.\n\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\n\n====Counting problems====\n\n'''[[Sharp-P|#P]]''' is an important complexity class of counting problems (not decision problems).\n\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Enumeration algorithms===\n\nSeveral [[output-sensitive algorithm|output-sensitive]] classes have been defined for [[enumeration algorithm]]s.\n\n{{expand section|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Reduction==\n{{main article|Reduction (complexity)}}\nMany complexity classes are defined using the concept of a reduction. A reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem. It captures the informal notion of a problem being at least as difficult as another problem. For instance, if a problem ''X'' can be solved using an algorithm for ''Y'', ''X'' is no more difficult than ''Y'', and we say that ''X'' ''reduces'' to ''Y''. There are many different types of reductions, based on the method of reduction, such as [[Cook reduction]]s, [[Karp reduction]]s and [[Levin reduction]]s, and the bound on the complexity of reductions, such as [[polynomial-time reduction]]s or [[log-space reduction]]s.\n\nThe most commonly used reduction is a polynomial-time reduction. This means that the reduction process takes polynomial time. For example, the problem of squaring an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers. This means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer. Indeed, this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm. Thus we see that squaring is not more difficult than multiplication, since squaring can be reduced to multiplication.\n\nThis motivates the concept of a problem being hard for a complexity class. A problem ''X'' is ''hard'' for a class of problems '''C''' if every problem in '''C''' can be reduced to ''X''. Thus no problem in '''C''' is harder than ''X'', since an algorithm for ''X'' allows us to solve any problem in '''C'''. Of course, the notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used. For complexity classes larger than '''P''', polynomial-time reductions are commonly used. In particular, the set of problems that are hard for '''NP''' is the set of '''[[NP-hard]]''' problems.\n\nIf a problem ''X'' is in '''C''' and is hard for '''C''', then ''X'' is said to be ''[[complete (complexity)|complete]]'' for '''C'''. This means that ''X'' is the hardest problem in '''C''' (Since there could be many problems which are equally hard, one might say that ''X'' is one of the hardest problems in '''C'''). Thus the class of [[NP-complete|'''NP'''-complete]] problems contains the most difficult problems in '''NP''', in the sense that they are the ones most likely not to be in P. Because the problem '''P'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''NP''' is not solved, being able to reduce a known '''NP'''-complete problem, \u03a0<sub>2</sub>, to another problem, \u03a0<sub>1</sub>, would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for \u03a0<sub>1</sub>.  This is because a polynomial-time solution to \u03a0<sub>1</sub> would yield a polynomial-time solution to \u03a0<sub>2</sub>. Similarly, because all '''NP''' problems can be reduced to the set, finding an '''NP'''-complete problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that '''P'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''NP'''.\n\n==Closure properties of classes==\nComplexity classes have a variety of closure properties; for example, decision classes may be closed under [[negation]], [[disjunction]], [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]], or even under all [[Logical connective|Boolean operations]]. Moreover, they might also be closed under a variety of quantification schemes. '''P''', for instance, is closed under all Boolean operations, and under quantification over polynomially sized domains. However, it is most likely not closed under quantification over exponential sized domains.\n\nEach class '''X''' that is not closed under negation has a complement class '''co-Y''', which consists of the complements of the languages contained in '''X'''. Similarly one can define the Boolean closure of a class, and so on; this is however less commonly done.\n\nOne possible route to separating two complexity classes is to find some closure property possessed by one and not by the other.\n\n==Relationships between complexity classes==\n\n===Savitch's theorem===\n{{Main|Savitch's theorem}}\nSavitch's theorem establishes that '''PSPACE''' = '''NPSPACE''' and '''EXPSPACE''' = '''NEXPSPACE'''. One central question of complexity theory is whether nondeterminism adds significant power to a computational model. This is central to the open '''P''' versus '''NP''' problem in the context of time. Savitch's theorem shows that for space, nondeterminism does not add significantly more power, where \"significant\" means the difference between polynomial and superpolynomial resource requirements (or, for '''EXPSPACE''', the difference between exponential and superexponential). For example, Savitch's theorem proves that no problem that requires exponential space for a deterministic Turing machine can be solved by a nondeterministic polynomial space Turing machine.\n\n===Other relations===\n\nThe following table shows some of the classes of problems (or languages, or grammars) that are considered in complexity theory.  If class '''X''' is a strict [[subset]] of '''Y''', then '''X''' is shown below '''Y''', with a dark line connecting them.  If '''X''' is a subset, but it is unknown whether they are equal sets, then the line is lighter and is dotted.  Technically, the breakdown into decidable and undecidable pertains more to the study of [[computability theory]] but is useful for putting the complexity classes in perspective.\n{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=2 |\n\n| colspan=4 |\n{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"background:lightBlue;

In particular, although '''DTIME'''(''n'') is contained in '''DTIME'''(''n''<sup>2</sup>), it would be interesting to know if the inclusion is strict. For time and space requirements, the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively. They are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources. Thus there are pairs of complexity classes such that one is properly included in the other. Having deduced such proper set inclusions, we can proceed to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is needed in order to increase the number of problems that can be solved.\n\nMore precisely, the [[time hierarchy theorem]] states that\n:<math>\\mathbf{DTIME}\\big(f(n) \\big) \\subsetneq \\mathbf{DTIME} \\big(f(n) \\sdot \\log^{2}(f(n)) \\big)</math>.\n\nThe [[space hierarchy theorem]] states that\n:<math>\\mathbf{DSPACE}\\big(f(n)\\big) \\subsetneq \\mathbf{DSPACE} \\big(f(n) \\sdot \\log(f(n)) \\big)</math>.\n\nThe time and space hierarchy theorems form the basis for most separation results of complexity classes. For instance, the time hierarchy theorem tells us that '''P''' is strictly contained in '''EXPTIME''', and the space hierarchy theorem tells us that '''L''' is strictly contained in '''PSPACE'''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of complexity classes]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Arora |first1=Sanjeev |last2=Barak|author1link=Sanjeev Arora |first2=Boaz|author2link=Boaz Barak |title=Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42426-4}}\n* {{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Sipser|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Course Technology|location=USA|isbn=978-0-534-95097-2|title-link=Introduction to the Theory of Computation}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo The Complexity Zoo]: A huge list of complexity classes, a reference for experts.\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.umass.edu/~immerman/complexity_theory.html |author=[[Neil Immerman]] |title=Computational Complexity Theory |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416021243/https://people.cs.umass.edu/~immerman/complexity_theory.html |archivedate=2016-04-16}} Includes a diagram showing the hierarchy of complexity classes and how they fit together.\n*[[Michael Garey]], and [[David S.

[[Vietnam]] is a member of [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]], [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] and the [[World Trade Organization]].\n\nSince the mid-1980s, through the [[Doi Moi]] reform period Vietnam has made a shift from a [[Centralization|highly centralized]] [[command economy]] to a [[mixed economy]] that uses both directive and [[indicative planning]] through [[Five-Year Plans of Vietnam|five-year plans]] with support from an open [[market economy|market-based economy]]. Over that period, the economy has experienced rapid growth. In the 21st century, Vietnam is in a period of being integrated into the global economy. Almost all Vietnamese enterprises are small and medium enterprises ([[Small and medium enterprises|SMEs]]). Vietnam has become a leading agricultural exporter and served as an attractive destination for foreign investment in [[Southeast Asia]].

The feudal dynasties always considered [[agriculture]] as the main economic base, and their economic thoughts have been predicated on [[physiocracy]]. Land ownership was regulated, and such large-scale works as [[Dike (construction)|dykes]] were constructed in the [[Red River Delta]] to facilitate wet rice cultivation. In peaceful times, soldiers were sent home to do farm work. Furthermore, the court prohibited slaughtering water buffalo and cattle and held many agriculture-related ceremonies. Handicrafts and art were valued, but commerce was deprecated, and businessmen were called by the derogatory term ''con bu\u00f4n''. The national economy was self-sufficient.\n\nFrom the 16th century, [[Confucianism]] was losing its influence on Vietnamese society and a monetary economy began to develop. Early commercial ports, such as [[H\u1ed9i An]], were constrained, and foreign countries with their different cultures and their invasion ambitions were seen as a threat. This policy of closure led to a degree of stagnation in the Vietnamese economy, and contributed to Vietnam becoming a French colony.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n=== 1858\u20131975 ===\nUntil the [[French Indochina|French colonization]] in the mid-19th century, Vietnam's economy had been mostly agrarian, subsistence-based and village-oriented. French colonizers, however, deliberately developed the regions differently as the French needed raw materials and a market for French manufactured goods, designating the [[Cochinchina|South]] for agricultural production as it was better suited for agriculture, and the [[Tonkin|North]] for manufacturing as it was naturally wealthy in mineral resources. Though the plan exaggerated regional divisions, the development of exports\u2014coal from the North, rice from the South\u2014and the importation of French manufactured goods stimulated domestic commerce.<ref name=\"cs\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/vntoc.html Vietnam country study].

In the South, while irrigated rice remained the principal subsistence crop, the French introduced plantation agriculture with products such as tea, cotton, and tobacco. The colonial government also developed some extractive industries, such as the mining of coal, iron, and nonferrous metals. A shipbuilding industry was begun in Hanoi;  railroads, roads, power stations, and hydraulics works were constructed. In the South, agricultural development concentrated on rice cultivation, and, nationally, rice and rubber were the main items of export. Domestic and foreign trade were centered around the Saigon-Cholon area. Industry in the South consisted mostly of food-processing plants and factories producing consumer goods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/vietnam/47.htm|title=Vietnam - The Economy - Historical Background|access-date=3 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhen the North and South were divided [[Geneva Conference (1954)|politically]] in 1954, they also adopted different economic ideologies: communism in the North and capitalism in the South. Destruction caused by the [[Second Indochina War]] from 1954 to 1975 seriously strained the economy. The situation was worsened by the country's 1.5 million military and civilian deaths, and the subsequent exodus of 1 million refugees, including tens of thousands of professionals, intellectuals, technicians and skilled workers.<ref name=\"cs\"/>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+GDP per capita in Vietnam, 1956\u20131974 (in US$/year)\n!Year\n!1956\n!1958\n!1960\n!1962\n!1964\n!1966\n!1968\n!1970\n!1972\n!1974\n|-\n|[[Republic of Vietnam]]\n|62\n|88\n|105\n|100\n|118\n|100\n|85\n|81\n|90\n|65\n|-\n|[[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]]\n|40\n|50\n|51\n|68\n|59\n|60\n|55\n|60\n|60\n|65\n|}\n\n=== 1976\u20131997 ===\nThe government's [[Five-Year Plans of Vietnam#The Second Five-Year Plan (1976\u201380)|Second Five-Year Plan]] (1976\u20131981) aimed for extraordinarily high{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=May 2017}} annual growth rates in industrial and agricultural sectors and national income and sought to integrate the North and the South, but the goals were not attained.

Efforts were also made to decentralize planning and improve the managerial skills of government officials.<ref name=\"cs\"/>\n\nAfter reunification in 1975, the economy of Vietnam was plagued by enormous difficulties in production, imbalances in supply and demand, inefficiencies in distribution and circulation, soaring inflation rates, and rising debt problems. Vietnam is one of the few countries in modern history to experience a sharp economic deterioration in a postwar reconstruction period. Its peacetime economy was one of the poorest in the world and had shown a negative to very slow growth in total national output as well as in agricultural and industrial production. Vietnam's gross domestic product ( GDP) in 1984 was valued at US$18.1 billion with a per capita income estimated to be between US$200 and US$300 per year. Reasons for this mediocre economic performance have included severe climatic conditions that afflicted agricultural crops, bureaucratic mismanagement, elimination of private ownership, extinction of entrepreneurial classes in the South, and military occupation of Cambodia (which resulted in a cutoff of much-needed international aid for reconstruction).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/vietnam/45.htm|title=Vietnam - The Economy|access-date=3 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nFrom the late 1970s until the early 1990s, Vietnam was a member of the [[Comecon]], and therefore was heavily dependent on trade with the [[Soviet Union]] and its allies. Following the dissolution of the Comecon and the loss of its traditional trading partners, Vietnam was forced to liberalize trade, devalue its exchange rate to increase exports, and embark on a policy of economic development.<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nIn 1986, Vietnam launched a political and economic renewal campaign (''[[\u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi]]'') that introduced reforms to facilitate the transition from a centralized economy to a \"[[socialist-oriented market economy]]\". ''\u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi'' combined government planning with [[free-market]] incentives and encouraged the establishment of private businesses and foreign investment, including [[Foreign direct investment|foreign-owned enterprises]]. Furthermore, the Vietnam government stressed the necessity to lower birth rates when developing the economic and social rights of the population by implementing a policy that restricted the number of children per household to two, called the [[two-child policy]].<ref name=\"Policy 1989\">{{cite journal|title=Vietnam's New Fertility Policy|journal=Population and Development Review|date=March 1989|volume=15|issue=1|pages=169\u2013172|doi=10.2307/1973424|jstor=1973424|last1=&#91;Council Of Ministers&#93;}}</ref> By the late 1990s, the success of the business and agricultural reforms ushered in under ''\u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi'' was evident.

The BTA provided for \"normal trade relations\" (NTR) status of Vietnamese goods in the U.S. market. It was expected that access to the U.S. market would allow Vietnam to hasten its transformation into a [[manufacturing]]-based, [[export]]-oriented economy. Furthermore, it would attract foreign investment, not only from the U.S., but also from [[Europe]], Asia and other regions.\n\nIn 2001, the ruling [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] approved a 10-year economic plan that enhanced the role of the private sector, while reaffirming the primacy of the state.<ref name=\"cp\"/> Growth then rose to 6% to 7% between 2000 and 2002 even in the midst of the global [[recession]], making it the world's second fastest-growing economy. At the same time, [[investment]] grew threefold and [[domestic savings]] quintupled.\n\nIn 2003, the private sector accounted for more than one-quarter of all industrial output.<ref name=\"cp\"/> However, between 2003 and 2005, Vietnam fell dramatically in the [[World Economic Forum]]'s global competitiveness report rankings, largely due to negative perceptions of the effectiveness of government institutions.<ref name=\"cp\"/> Official [[political corruption|corruption]] is endemic, and Vietnam lags in property rights, efficient regulation of markets, and labor and financial market reforms.<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nVietnam had an average GDP growth of 7.1% a year from 2000 to 2004. The GDP growth was 8.4% in 2005, the second-largest in Asia, trailing only [[China]]'s. The government estimated that GDP grew in 2006 by 8.17%. According to the Minister of Planning and Investment, the government targeted a GDP growth of around 8.5% in 2007.<ref>[http://ssrn.com/abstract=1486204 SSRN.com] Vuong Quan Hoang and Tran Tri Dung, 2009</ref>\n\nOn November 7, 2006, the General Council at the World Trade Organization ([[WTO]]) approved Vietnam's accession package. On January 11, 2007, Vietnam officially became the WTO's 149th member, after 11 years of preparation, including eight years of negotiation.<ref name=\"wto.org\"/> The country's access to the WTO was intended to provide an important boost to the economy, as it ensured that the liberalizing reforms continue and created options for trade expansion. However, the WTO accession also brought serious challenges, requiring the economy to open up to increasing foreign competition.\n\nVietnam's economy continues to expand at an annual rate in excess of 7%, one of the fastest-growing in the world, but it grew from an extremely low base, as it suffered the crippling effect of the [[Vietnam War]] from the 1950s to the 1970s, as well as the austerity measures introduced in its aftermath.<ref name=\"cp\"/> In 2012, the communist party was forced to apologise about the mismanagement of the economy after large numbers of SOEs went bankrupt and inflation rose. The main danger has been over the bad debt in the banks totalling to 15% and forecast growth is 5.2% for 2012 but this is also due to the global economic crisis.<ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-10-22/vietnam-will-struggle-to-meet-2012-growth-target-southeast-asia vietnam will struggle to meet 2012 growth target southeast asia], Bloomberg.

30.7 million cubic meters of wood. Production of sawn wood was a more modest 2,950 cubic meters. In 1992, in response to [[deforestation in Vietnam|dwindling forests]], Vietnam imposed a ban on the export of logs and raw timber. In 1997, the ban was extended to all timber products except wooden artifacts. During the 1990s, Vietnam began to reclaim land for forests with a tree-planting program.<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nVietnam's [[fishing]] industry, which has abundant resources given the country's long coastline and [[rivers in Vietnam|extensive network of rivers and lakes]], has generally experienced moderate growth. In 2003, the total catch was about 2.6 million tons. However, seafood exports increased fourfold between 1990 and 2002 to more than US$2 billion, driven in part by [[shrimp]] farms in the South and \"catfish\", which are a different species from their American counterparts, but are marketed in the United States under the same name. By selling vast quantities of shrimp and catfish to the U.S., Vietnam triggered [[antidumping]] complaints by the U.S., which imposed tariffs in the case of catfish and was considering doing the same for shrimp.

In 2002, Vietnam brought ashore 2.26 billion cubic meters of natural gas. [[Hydroelectric]] power is another source of energy. In 2004, Vietnam confirmed plans to build a [[Ninh Thu\u1eadn 1 Nuclear Power Plant|nuclear power plant]]  with [[Rosatom|Russian assistance]],<ref name=\"cp\"/> and a [[Ninh Thu\u1eadn 2 Nuclear Power Plant|second]] by a Japanese group.\n\n===Industry and manufacturing===\n{{Main|Manufacturing in Vietnam}}\n\nAlthough the industrial sector contributed 40.1% of GDP in 2004, it employed only 12.9% of the workforce. In 2000, 22.4% of industrial production was attributable to non-state activities. From 1994 to 2004, the industrial sector grew at an average annual rate of 10.3%. Manufacturing contributed 20.3% of GDP in 2004, while employing 10.2% of the workforce. From 1994 to 2004, manufacturing GDP grew at an average annual rate of 11.2%. The top manufacturing sectors \u2014 electronics, [[food processing]], cigarettes and tobacco, textiles, chemicals, and footwear goods \u2014 experienced rapid growth.

In 2003 new foreign direct investment commitments were US$1.5 billion. The largest sector by far for licensed FDI is industry and [[construction]]. Other sectors attracting FDI are oil and gas, fisheries, construction, agriculture and forestry, transportation and communications, and hotels and tourism.

Despite rising investments, foreign investors still regard Vietnam as a risky destination, as confirmed by recent survey by the [[Japan External Trade Organization]] of Japanese companies operating in Vietnam. Many of the respondents complained about high costs of utilities, office rentals and skilled labor. Corruption, bureaucracy, lack of transparent regulations and the failure to enforce investor rights are additional obstacles to investment, according to the U.S. State Department. Vietnam tied with several nations for the 102nd place in Transparencies International's Corruption Perceptions Index in 2004.<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nThe [[World Bank]]'s assistance program for Vietnam has three objectives: to support Vietnam's transition to a market economy, to enhance equitable and [[sustainable development]] and to promote good governance. From 1993 through 2004, Vietnam received pledges of US$29 billion of [[official development assistance]] (ODA), of which about US$14 billion, or 49%, has been disbursed. In 2004, international donors pledged ODA of US$2.25 billion, of which US$1.65 billion actually was disbursed. Three donors accounted for 80% of disbursements in 2004: Japan, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank.

So from a theoretical and practical view industrialization and modernization are a necessary historical process that Vietnam must go through change our country into an industrial country [\u2026]\u201d''\n\n-7th National Congress-Central Committee (1991)\n\n====Socialist-Oriented Market Economy (SOME)====\n''\u201cThe nature of a socialist-oriented market economy in our country:\n\u2022\tIt is not an economy managed according in the style of a centralized bureaucratic subsidized system\n\u2022\tIt is not a free market capitalist economy\n\u2022\tIt is not yet entirely a socialist-oriented economy. This is because our country is in the period of transition to socialism, and there is still a mixture of, and a struggle between, the old and the new, so there simultaneously are, and are not yet sufficiently, socialist factors\u201d''\n\n-7th National Congress-Central Committee (1991)\n\n===Development strategy===\n====Trade liberalization====\nOver the past 30 years, Vietnam has signed numerous trade agreements with different partners, promoting the country as one of the main manufacturing hubs in the world. In 1995, Vietnam joined the ASEAN community. In 2000, it signed a free trade agreement with the United States, to be followed by admission to the World Trade Organisation in 2007. Since then, the country has further integrated itself into the world economy with bilateral agreements with other ASEAN countries, China, India, Japan, and Korea, to name a few. Vietnam has actively working with other partners on ratifying the Trans-Pacific Partnership to form CP TPP, or TPP-11, after the withdrawal of the US, in order to promote economic cooperation, regional connectivity and promote economic growth between member countries. The World Bank estimates that the CP TPP would help the country's GDP to grow by 1.1% by 2030 with a boost to productivity. The overall impact of these efforts was the lowering of tariffs on both imports and exports to and from Viet Nam, and an improved trade balance with a surplus of $2.8 billion during the first eight months of 2018 (Vietnam Custom Department).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.customs.gov.vn/Lists/ThongKeHaiQuan/Default.aspx|title=Chuy\u00ean trang Th\u1ed1ng k\u00ea H\u1ea3i quan :: H\u1ea3i quan Vi\u1ec7t Nam|website=www.customs.gov.vn}}</ref> Most recently, on June 30, 2019, Vietnam signed the Free Trade Agreement and Investment Protection Agreement with the EU after 10 years of negotiation, making it only the fourth country in Asia which managed to sign such agreement with the western bloc (after Japan, South Korea, and Singapore)\n\n====Domestic reform====\nThe government has made real effort in changing its mindset toward a more open market economy, lowering the cost of doing business, and putting regulation in place to ensure rights and orders. In 1986 the government passed its first Law on Foreign Investment, allowing foreign companies to operate in Vietnam. The constitution has come a long way since, with the law being revised regularly to cater for a more investor-friendly business environment while aiming to reduce red-tape and accelerate foreign investment into the country. The Global Competitiveness Report<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-global-competitiveness-report-2017-2018/|title=The Global Competitiveness Report 2017-2018|website=World Economic Forum}}</ref> by World Economic Forum placed Vietnam at 55th in 2017, rising from 77th place in 2006 . In the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business rankings,<ref>http://www.doingbusiness.org/content/dam/doingBusiness/media/Annual-Reports/English/DB2018-Full-Report.pdf</ref> Viet Nam also rose from 104th place in 2007 to 68th place in 2017. The Bank commended Vietnam on progress made in enforcing contracts, increasing access to credit and basic infrastructure, and trading, among other factors.\n\n====Human and physical capital investment====\nVietnam invested a lot in its human capital and infrastructure. With a growing population \u2013 96 million today, up from 60 million in 1986, and more than half are under the age of 35\u2013 Vietnam made large public investments in education, especially making primary education universal and compulsory. This was necessary, given the country's export-led growth strategy, where literacy for the mass workforce is deemed important for growth in the manufacturing sector. On the other hand, Vietnam also invested heavily in infrastructure, ensuring cheap mass access to necessity like electricity, water, and especially the internet. These two factors together helped Vietnam to become a hub for foreign investment and manufacturing in Southeast Asia. Japanese and Korean electronics companies like Samsung, LG, Olympus, and Pioneer built factories, and countless European and American apparel makers set up textile operation in the country. Intel opened a $1 billion chip factory in 2010, signalling the importance of Vietnam's strategic positioning in the eyes of international business community.\n\n====Sustainable growth====\nCompare to other developing countries, the economic growth in Vietnam was considered to be fairly inclusive and equitable. The Inclusive Development Index<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-inclusive-development-index-2018/|title=The Inclusive Development Index 2018|website=World Economic Forum}}</ref> by WEF put Vietnam in a group of countries that have done particularly well and advancing in the ranking of the world's most inclusive economies. This has been notably evident with the role of women participating in the economy. Their labor force participation rate is within 10% of that of men, a smaller gap than many other countries according to World Bank, and in 2015 women-led households are generally not poorer than those led by men. Primary and secondary enrollment rates for boys and girls are also essentially the same, and more girls continue studying in high school than boys. The government is actively reviewing and adjusting its policy, as shown in the current official Development Strategy Action Plan 2011-2020, to develop appropriate mechanisms for a more equitable growth across the country; promoting the advantages of each regions, working in collaboration with each other to support and amplify the fruit of development.\n\nIn 2017, with the help of the United Nations, Vietnam official started the ground work to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals with the development of the \"One Strategic Plan\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vietnam.opendevelopmentmekong.net/topics/sustainable-development-goals/|title=Sustainable Development Goals}}</ref> integrating the SDGs with the nation's Socio-Economic Development Strategy (2011-2020) and Socio-Economic Development Plan (2016-2020). The OSP can be used as a guideline for government agencies to implement the SDGs in the most effective ways, focusing on areas of importance, such as: investing in people, climate resilience and environmental sustainability, prosperity and partnership, justice and inclusive governance. Vietnam has also developed a National Action Plan to review current growth policies and update these to align with the interest of the SDGs. This is done in consultation with ministries, local governments, and other stakeholders so that a common framework can be set forward.\n\n==Economic indicators and international rankings==\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!

[[Vietnam]] is a member of [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]], [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] and the [[World Trade Organization]].\n\nSince the mid-1980s, through the [[Doi Moi]] reform period Vietnam has made a shift from a [[Centralization|highly centralized]] [[command economy]] to a [[mixed economy]] that uses both directive and [[indicative planning]] through [[Five-Year Plans of Vietnam|five-year plans]] with support from an open [[market economy|market-based economy]]. Over that period, the economy has experienced rapid growth. In the 21st century, Vietnam is in a period of being integrated into the global economy. Almost all Vietnamese enterprises are small and medium enterprises ([[Small and medium enterprises|SMEs]]). Vietnam has become a leading agricultural exporter and served as an attractive destination for foreign investment in [[Southeast Asia]]. In a similar fashion to other [[Communist countries]] after the end of the [[Cold War]], the [[planned economy]] of Vietnam lost the momentum for productivity and sustainable growth{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}.

The feudal dynasties always considered [[agriculture]] as the main economic base, and their economic thoughts have been predicated on [[physiocracy]]. Land ownership was regulated, and such large-scale works as [[Dike (construction)|dykes]] were constructed in the [[Red River Delta]] to facilitate wet rice cultivation. In peaceful times, soldiers were sent home to do farm work. Furthermore, the court prohibited slaughtering water buffalo and cattle and held many agriculture-related ceremonies. Handicrafts and art were valued, but commerce was deprecated, and businessmen were called by the derogatory term ''con bu\u00f4n''. The national economy was self-sufficient.\n\nFrom the 16th century, [[Confucianism]] was losing its influence on Vietnamese society and a monetary economy began to develop. Early commercial ports, such as [[H\u1ed9i An]], were constrained, and foreign countries with their different cultures and their invasion ambitions were seen as a threat. This policy of closure led to a degree of stagnation in the Vietnamese economy, and contributed to Vietnam becoming a French colony.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n=== 1858\u20131975 ===\nUntil the [[French Indochina|French colonization]] in the mid-19th century, Vietnam's economy had been mostly agrarian, subsistence-based and village-oriented. French colonizers, however, deliberately developed the regions differently as the French needed raw materials and a market for French manufactured goods, designating the [[Cochinchina|South]] for agricultural production as it was better suited for agriculture, and the [[Tonkin|North]] for manufacturing as it was naturally wealthy in mineral resources. Though the plan exaggerated regional divisions, the development of exports\u2014coal from the North, rice from the South\u2014and the importation of French manufactured goods stimulated domestic commerce.<ref name=\"cs\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/vntoc.html Vietnam country study].

In the South, while irrigated rice remained the principal subsistence crop, the French introduced plantation agriculture with products such as tea, cotton, and tobacco. The colonial government also developed some extractive industries, such as the mining of coal, iron, and nonferrous metals. A shipbuilding industry was begun in Hanoi;  railroads, roads, power stations, and hydraulics works were constructed. In the South, agricultural development concentrated on rice cultivation, and, nationally, rice and rubber were the main items of export. Domestic and foreign trade were centered around the Saigon-Cholon area. Industry in the South consisted mostly of food-processing plants and factories producing consumer goods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/vietnam/47.htm|title=Vietnam - The Economy - Historical Background|access-date=3 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhen the North and South were divided [[Geneva Conference (1954)|politically]] in 1954, they also adopted different economic ideologies: communism in the North and capitalism in the South. Destruction caused by the [[Second Indochina War]] from 1954 to 1975 seriously strained the economy. The situation was worsened by the country's 1.5 million military and civilian deaths, and the subsequent exodus of 1 million refugees, including tens of thousands of professionals, intellectuals, technicians and skilled workers.<ref name=\"cs\"/>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+GDP per capita in Vietnam, 1956\u20131974 (in US$/year)\n!Year\n!1956\n!1958\n!1960\n!1962\n!1964\n!1966\n!1968\n!1970\n!1972\n!1974\n|-\n|[[Republic of Vietnam]]\n|62\n|88\n|105\n|100\n|118\n|100\n|85\n|81\n|90\n|65\n|-\n|[[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]]\n|40\n|50\n|51\n|68\n|59\n|60\n|55\n|60\n|60\n|65\n|}\n\n=== 1976\u20131997 ===\nThe government's [[Five-Year Plans of Vietnam#The Second Five-Year Plan (1976\u201380)|Second Five-Year Plan]] (1976\u20131981) aimed for extraordinarily high{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=May 2017}} annual growth rates in industrial and agricultural sectors and national income and sought to integrate the North and the South, but the goals were not attained.

Efforts were also made to decentralize planning and improve the managerial skills of government officials.<ref name=\"cs\"/>\n\nAfter reunification in 1975, the economy of Vietnam was plagued by enormous difficulties in production, imbalances in supply and demand, inefficiencies in distribution and circulation, soaring inflation rates, and rising debt problems. Vietnam is one of the few countries in modern history to experience a sharp economic deterioration in a postwar reconstruction period. Its peacetime economy was one of the poorest in the world and had shown a negative to very slow growth in total national output as well as in agricultural and industrial production. Vietnam's gross domestic product ( GDP) in 1984 was valued at US$18.1 billion with a per capita income estimated to be between US$200 and US$300 per year. Reasons for this mediocre economic performance have included severe climatic conditions that afflicted agricultural crops, bureaucratic mismanagement, elimination of private ownership, extinction of entrepreneurial classes in the South, and military occupation of Cambodia (which resulted in a cutoff of much-needed international aid for reconstruction).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/vietnam/45.htm|title=Vietnam - The Economy|access-date=3 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nFrom the late 1970s until the early 1990s, Vietnam was a member of the [[Comecon]], and therefore was heavily dependent on trade with the [[Soviet Union]] and its allies. Following the dissolution of the Comecon and the loss of its traditional trading partners, Vietnam was forced to liberalize trade, devalue its exchange rate to increase exports, and embark on a policy of economic development.<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nIn 1986, Vietnam launched a political and economic renewal campaign (''[[\u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi]]'') that introduced reforms to facilitate the transition from a centralized economy to a \"[[socialist-oriented market economy]]\". ''\u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi'' combined government planning with [[free-market]] incentives and encouraged the establishment of private businesses and foreign investment, including [[Foreign direct investment|foreign-owned enterprises]]. Furthermore, the Vietnam government stressed the necessity to lower birth rates when developing the economic and social rights of the population by implementing a policy that restricted the number of children per household to two, called the [[two-child policy]].<ref name=\"Policy 1989\">{{cite journal|title=Vietnam's New Fertility Policy|journal=Population and Development Review|date=March 1989|volume=15|issue=1|pages=169\u2013172|doi=10.2307/1973424|jstor=1973424|last1=&#91;Council Of Ministers&#93;}}</ref> By the late 1990s, the success of the business and agricultural reforms ushered in under ''\u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi'' was evident.

In 1999, exports accounted for 40% of GDP, an impressive performance in the midst of the economic crisis that hit other countries in Asia.

The economy saw continuous real GDP growth of at least 5% since 2000.\n\nThe signing of the [[Bilateral Trade Agreement]] (BTA) between the United States and Vietnam on July 13, 2000, was a significant milestone. The BTA provided for \"normal trade relations\" (NTR) status of Vietnamese goods in the U.S. market. It was expected that access to the U.S. market would allow Vietnam to hasten its transformation into a [[manufacturing]]-based, [[export]]-oriented economy. Furthermore, it would attract foreign investment, not only from the U.S., but also from [[Europe]], Asia and other regions.\n\nIn 2001, the ruling [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] approved a 10-year economic plan that enhanced the role of the private sector, while reaffirming the primacy of the state.<ref name=\"cp\"/> Growth then rose to 6% to 7% between 2000 and 2002 even in the midst of the global [[recession]], making it the world's second fastest-growing economy.

The GDP growth was 8.4% in 2005, the second-largest in Asia, trailing only [[China]]'s. The government estimated that GDP grew in 2006 by 8.17%.

However, the WTO accession also brought serious challenges, requiring the economy to open up to increasing foreign competition.\n\nVietnam's economy continues to expand at an annual rate in excess of 7%, one of the fastest-growing in the world, but it grew from an extremely low base, as it suffered the crippling effect of the [[Vietnam War]] from the 1950s to the 1970s, as well as the austerity measures introduced in its aftermath.<ref name=\"cp\"/> In 2012, the communist party was forced to apologise about the mismanagement of the economy after large numbers of SOEs went bankrupt and inflation rose.

30.7 million cubic meters of wood. Production of sawn wood was a more modest 2,950 cubic meters. In 1992, in response to [[deforestation in Vietnam|dwindling forests]], Vietnam imposed a ban on the export of logs and raw timber. In 1997, the ban was extended to all timber products except wooden artifacts. During the 1990s, Vietnam began to reclaim land for forests with a tree-planting program.<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nVietnam's [[fishing]] industry, which has abundant resources given the country's long coastline and [[rivers in Vietnam|extensive network of rivers and lakes]], has generally experienced moderate growth. In 2003, the total catch was about 2.6 million tons. However, seafood exports increased fourfold between 1990 and 2002 to more than US$2 billion, driven in part by [[shrimp]] farms in the South and \"catfish\", which are a different species from their American counterparts, but are marketed in the United States under the same name. By selling vast quantities of shrimp and catfish to the U.S., Vietnam triggered [[antidumping]] complaints by the U.S., which imposed tariffs in the case of catfish and was considering doing the same for shrimp. In 2005, the seafood industry began to focus on domestic demand to compensate for declining exports.<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nVietnam is one of the top rice exporting countries in the world, but the limited sophistication of small-scale Vietnamese farmers causes quality to suffer.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://thediplomat.com/2014/04/why-cant-vietnam-grow-better-rice/ |title=Why Can't Vietnam Grow Better Rice? |last1=Rosen |first1=Elisabeth |date=24 April 2014 |website=thediplomat.com |publisher=The Diplomat |accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref> Vietnam is also the world's second largest exporter of coffee, trailing behind Brazil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstopexports.com/coffee-exports-country/|title=World's Top Exports - Coffee Exports by Country|work=World's Top Exports|access-date=3 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Energy, mining and minerals===\n{{Main|Energy in Vietnam}}\n\n[[Petroleum]] is the main source of energy, followed by [[coal]], which contributes about 25% of the country's energy (excluding [[biomass]]). Vietnam's oil reserves are in the range of 270\u2013500 million tons. Oil production rose rapidly to {{convert|403300|oilbbl/d|m3/d}} in 2004, but output is believed to have peaked and is expected to decline gradually.\n\nIn 2003, mining and quarrying accounted for 9.4% of GDP, and the sector employed 0.7% of the workforce. Petroleum and coal are the main mineral exports. Also mined are [[antimony]], [[bauxite]], [[chromium]], [[gold]], [[iron]], natural [[phosphates]], [[tin]], and [[zinc]].<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nCrude oil was Vietnam's leading export until the late 2000s, when high-tech electrical manufactures emerged to become the biggest export market (by 2014, crude oil comprised only 5% of Vietnamese exports, compared to 20% of all exports in 1996). This is in part because Vietnam crude oil peaked in 2004, when crude oil represented 22% of all export earnings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/export/vnm/all/show/1996/?prod_class=hs4&details_treemap=2&disable_widgets=false&disable_search=false&node_size=none&queryActivated=true&highlight=&yaxis=complexity|title=What did Viet Nam export in 1996? - The Atlas Of Economic Complexity|accessdate=23 July 2016}}</ref> Petroleum exports are in the form of crude petroleum because Vietnam has a very limited refining capacity.

Coal production was almost 19 million tons in 2003, compared with 9.6 million tons in 1999. Vietnam's potential [[natural gas]] reserves are 1.3 trillion cubic meters. In 2002, Vietnam brought ashore 2.26 billion cubic meters of natural gas. [[Hydroelectric]] power is another source of energy. In 2004, Vietnam confirmed plans to build a [[Ninh Thu\u1eadn 1 Nuclear Power Plant|nuclear power plant]]  with [[Rosatom|Russian assistance]],<ref name=\"cp\"/> and a [[Ninh Thu\u1eadn 2 Nuclear Power Plant|second]] by a Japanese group.\n\n===Industry and manufacturing===\n{{Main|Manufacturing in Vietnam}}\n\nAlthough the industrial sector contributed 40.1% of GDP in 2004, it employed only 12.9% of the workforce. In 2000, 22.4% of industrial production was attributable to non-state activities. From 1994 to 2004, the industrial sector grew at an average annual rate of 10.3%. Manufacturing contributed 20.3% of GDP in 2004, while employing 10.2% of the workforce. From 1994 to 2004, manufacturing GDP grew at an average annual rate of 11.2%. The top manufacturing sectors \u2014 electronics, [[food processing]], cigarettes and tobacco, textiles, chemicals, and footwear goods \u2014 experienced rapid growth.

Although the United States and Vietnam reached a landmark bilateral agreement in December 2001, which helped increase Vietnam's exports to the United States, disagreements over textile and catfish exports are hindering full implementation of the agreement. Further disrupting the economic relations between the two countries were efforts in [[United States Congress|Congress]] to link non-humanitarian aid to Vietnam's [[human rights]] record. Barriers to trade and [[intellectual property]] are also within the purview of bilateral discussions.<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nGiven neighboring China's rapid economic ascendancy, Vietnam highly values its economic relationship with China. Following the resolution of most territorial disputes, trade with China is growing rapidly, and in 2004, Vietnam imported more products from China than from any other country. In November 2004, the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN), of which Vietnam is a member, and China announced plans to establish the world's largest free-trade area by 2010.<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nVietnam became a member of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) on January 11, 2007.<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nIn December 2015, Vietnam joined the [[ASEAN Economic Community]] along with the 9 other ASEAN members.

Textiles and garments are still an important part in Vietnam's export, valued about US$17.9 billion in 2013.\n\nIn 2014, exports rose 13.6%, reaching US$150.1 billion. Electronics and electronics parts, textiles and garments, computers and computer parts are the three main export groups of Vietnam.

In 2003 new foreign direct investment commitments were US$1.5 billion. The largest sector by far for licensed FDI is industry and [[construction]]. Other sectors attracting FDI are oil and gas, fisheries, construction, agriculture and forestry, transportation and communications, and hotels and tourism. From 2006 to 2010, Vietnam hoped to receive US$18 billion of FDI to support a targeted growth rate in excess of 7%. Despite rising investments, foreign investors still regard Vietnam as a risky destination, as confirmed by recent survey by the [[Japan External Trade Organization]] of Japanese companies operating in Vietnam. Many of the respondents complained about high costs of utilities, office rentals and skilled labor. Corruption, bureaucracy, lack of transparent regulations and the failure to enforce investor rights are additional obstacles to investment, according to the U.S. State Department.

So from a theoretical and practical view industrialization and modernization are a necessary historical process that Vietnam must go through change our country into an industrial country [\u2026]\u201d''\n\n-7th National Congress-Central Committee (1991)\n\n====Socialist-Oriented Market Economy (SOME)====\n''\u201cThe nature of a socialist-oriented market economy in our country:\n\u2022\tIt is not an economy managed according in the style of a centralized bureaucratic subsidized system\n\u2022\tIt is not a free market capitalist economy\n\u2022\tIt is not yet entirely a socialist-oriented economy. This is because our country is in the period of transition to socialism, and there is still a mixture of, and a struggle between, the old and the new, so there simultaneously are, and are not yet sufficiently, socialist factors\u201d''\n\n-7th National Congress-Central Committee (1991)\n\n===Development strategy===\n====Trade liberalization====\nOver the past 30 years, Vietnam has signed numerous trade agreements with different partners, promoting the country as one of the main manufacturing hubs in the world. In 1995, Vietnam joined the ASEAN community. In 2000, it signed a free trade agreement with the United States, to be followed by admission to the World Trade Organisation in 2007. Since then, the country has further integrated itself into the world economy with bilateral agreements with other ASEAN countries, China, India, Japan, and Korea, to name a few. Vietnam has actively working with other partners on ratifying the Trans-Pacific Partnership to form CP TPP, or TPP-11, after the withdrawal of the US, in order to promote economic cooperation, regional connectivity and promote economic growth between member countries. The World Bank estimates that the CP TPP would help the country's GDP to grow by 1.1% by 2030 with a boost to productivity. The overall impact of these efforts was the lowering of tariffs on both imports and exports to and from Viet Nam, and an improved trade balance with a surplus of $2.8 billion during the first eight months of 2018 (Vietnam Custom Department).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.customs.gov.vn/Lists/ThongKeHaiQuan/Default.aspx|title=Chuy\u00ean trang Th\u1ed1ng k\u00ea H\u1ea3i quan :: H\u1ea3i quan Vi\u1ec7t Nam|website=www.customs.gov.vn}}</ref> Most recently, on June 30, 2019, Vietnam signed the Free Trade Agreement and Investment Protection Agreement with the EU after 10 years of negotiation, making it only the fourth country in Asia which managed to sign such agreement with the western bloc (after Japan, South Korea, and Singapore)\n\n====Domestic reform====\nThe government has made real effort in changing its mindset toward a more open market economy, lowering the cost of doing business, and putting regulation in place to ensure rights and orders. In 1986 the government passed its first Law on Foreign Investment, allowing foreign companies to operate in Vietnam. The constitution has come a long way since, with the law being revised regularly to cater for a more investor-friendly business environment while aiming to reduce red-tape and accelerate foreign investment into the country. The Global Competitiveness Report<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-global-competitiveness-report-2017-2018/|title=The Global Competitiveness Report 2017-2018|website=World Economic Forum}}</ref> by World Economic Forum placed Vietnam at 55th in 2017, rising from 77th place in 2006 . In the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business rankings,<ref>http://www.doingbusiness.org/content/dam/doingBusiness/media/Annual-Reports/English/DB2018-Full-Report.pdf</ref> Viet Nam also rose from 104th place in 2007 to 68th place in 2017. The Bank commended Vietnam on progress made in enforcing contracts, increasing access to credit and basic infrastructure, and trading, among other factors.\n\n====Human and physical capital investment====\nVietnam invested a lot in its human capital and infrastructure. With a growing population \u2013 96 million today, up from 60 million in 1986, and more than half are under the age of 35\u2013 Vietnam made large public investments in education, especially making primary education universal and compulsory. This was necessary, given the country's export-led growth strategy, where literacy for the mass workforce is deemed important for growth in the manufacturing sector. On the other hand, Vietnam also invested heavily in infrastructure, ensuring cheap mass access to necessity like electricity, water, and especially the internet. These two factors together helped Vietnam to become a hub for foreign investment and manufacturing in Southeast Asia. Japanese and Korean electronics companies like Samsung, LG, Olympus, and Pioneer built factories, and countless European and American apparel makers set up textile operation in the country. Intel opened a $1 billion chip factory in 2010, signalling the importance of Vietnam's strategic positioning in the eyes of international business community.\n\n====Sustainable growth====\nCompare to other developing countries, the economic growth in Vietnam was considered to be fairly inclusive and equitable. The Inclusive Development Index<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-inclusive-development-index-2018/|title=The Inclusive Development Index 2018|website=World Economic Forum}}</ref> by WEF put Vietnam in a group of countries that have done particularly well and advancing in the ranking of the world's most inclusive economies. This has been notably evident with the role of women participating in the economy. Their labor force participation rate is within 10% of that of men, a smaller gap than many other countries according to World Bank, and in 2015 women-led households are generally not poorer than those led by men. Primary and secondary enrollment rates for boys and girls are also essentially the same, and more girls continue studying in high school than boys. The government is actively reviewing and adjusting its policy, as shown in the current official Development Strategy Action Plan 2011-2020, to develop appropriate mechanisms for a more equitable growth across the country; promoting the advantages of each regions, working in collaboration with each other to support and amplify the fruit of development.\n\nIn 2017, with the help of the United Nations, Vietnam official started the ground work to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals with the development of the \"One Strategic Plan\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vietnam.opendevelopmentmekong.net/topics/sustainable-development-goals/|title=Sustainable Development Goals}}</ref> integrating the SDGs with the nation's Socio-Economic Development Strategy (2011-2020) and Socio-Economic Development Plan (2016-2020). The OSP can be used as a guideline for government agencies to implement the SDGs in the most effective ways, focusing on areas of importance, such as: investing in people, climate resilience and environmental sustainability, prosperity and partnership, justice and inclusive governance. Vietnam has also developed a National Action Plan to review current growth policies and update these to align with the interest of the SDGs. This is done in consultation with ministries, local governments, and other stakeholders so that a common framework can be set forward.\n\n==Economic indicators and international rankings==\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Though the original 1960s series aired as a standard Hanna-Barbera [[Saturday-morning cartoon|Saturday-morning superhero cartoon]], ''Space Ghost Coast to Coast'' was a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the series intended for adults, reinterpreted as a [[Surreal humour|surreal]] spoof [[talk show]] and produced using the original artwork. The first two seasons were presented as a serious talk show with subdued jokes, while the later seasons relied more on [[surrealism]], [[non sequitur (literary device)|non-sequitur]], and tabloid.\n\n''Space Ghost Coast to Coast'' is considered to be the first fully produced [[Cartoon Network]] original series. It premiered on April 15, 1994, and originally ended on December 17, 1999.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.geek.com/television/space-ghost-coast-to-coast-is-still-influential-and-funny-25-years-later-1782448/|title='Space Ghost Coast to Coast' Is Still Influential and Funny, 25 Years Later|date=2019-04-12|website=Geek.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190416193713/https://www.geek.com/television/space-ghost-coast-to-coast-is-still-influential-and-funny-25-years-later-1782448/|archive-date=April 16, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The series was revived on May 7, 2001, and was moved to the new [[Adult Swim]] late programming block on September 2 of that year, where new episodes premiered until April 12, 2004. Two final seasons were released on [[GameTap]] from 2006 to 2008. Over 11 seasons, [[List of Space Ghost Coast to Coast episodes|108 episodes]] aired. The series is notable for helping launch the careers of animators [[Adam Reed]], [[Matt Thompson (animator)|Matt Thompson]], [[Andy Merrill]], Jim Fortier, Pete Smith, [[Michael Ouweleen]], [[Eric Richter]], [[Dave Willis]], and [[Matt Maiellaro]].\n\n''Space Ghost Coast to Coast'' had two [[Spin-off (media)|spinoff]] series in the form of ''[[Cartoon Planet]]'' and ''[[The Brak Show]]'', and inspired or influenced other series including ''[[Sealab 2021]]''; ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]''; ''[[Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law]]''; ''[[Perfect Hair Forever]]''; and ''[[The Eric Andre Show]]''.\n\n==Format==\n{{ref improve section|date=January 2019}}\n''Space Ghost Coast to Coast'' used the talk show format as its template, but subverted it regularly. Various celebrities appeared on the show as guests. They were shown on a TV screen next to Space Ghost's desk, and unlike the characters, they were not animated. In early episodes of the show, Space Ghost apparently believed his guests were other superheroes and usually opened the interview by asking them about their superpowers. His interactions with guests were almost always painfully awkward, and sometimes hostile. It was sometimes hard to tell if guests were aware of the nature of the program on which they were appearing. Their answers often did not match the questions coming from Space Ghost, because the questions were changed after the interview. This method was dropped in later episodes, and the guests were allowed to directly interact with the characters.\n\nSpace Ghost's relationship with his co-workers was even worse. His [[bandleader]], an evil talking [[mantis]] named [[Zorak]], and his director/producer, a red-helmeted lava man named Moltar, worked for Space Ghost as punishment for their crimes. They frequently disrupt the show and make no secret of the fact that they hate him.\n\nMost episodes of ''Space Ghost Coast to Coast'' were about 15 minutes in length, although there were a few 30-minute episodes. Cartoon Network often aired two episodes back-to-back to make a 30-minute [[Block programming|programming block]]. In the first few years of the show, Cartoon Network would show episodes of the original 1960s and 1980s ''[[Space Ghost (TV series)|Space Ghost]]'' cartoons (sometimes with an unusual added [[laugh track]]) after the 11-minute episode of ''Space Ghost Coast to Coast''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Music===\nIn early seasons of the show, music was played by Zorak and his band \"The Original Way-Outs\". The original theme song, \"Hit Single\", was composed by [[free jazz]] guitarist [[Sonny Sharrock]], performed by Sharrock on guitar, Lance Carter on drums, Eddie Horst on bass and Alfreda Gerald on vocals. Sharrock and Carter recorded a number of songs for the show, several of which were later compiled on the [[music album|album]] ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast (album)|Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]''. As a tribute to Sharrock, who died in May 1994 shortly after the show first aired, the episode \"Sharrock\" featured nearly fifteen minutes of unedited takes of music recorded for the show.\n\nSeasons 4\u20136 featured a new closing theme by [[Man or Astro-man?]] and in later seasons the opening theme and titles were almost completely abandoned. Various other music was sometimes used as the theme song, including the ''[[CHiPs]]'' theme song for the episode titled \"CHiPs\". An hour-long musical season finale for the 1998 season was planned, featuring the bands [[Yo La Tengo]] and [[Cornershop]], but was never produced.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-w0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA22&lpg=PA22&dq=combustible+edison+space+ghost&source=bl&ots=b9S22CKQHK&sig=PCDnraD0kVmglAiJjXkkoEusgZE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=hruVULnLMIrhiwLJ6oGoBQ&ved=0CFIQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=yo%20la%20tengo&f=false|title=On The Tube|date=June 20, 1996|magazine=[[Billboard Magazine]]|last=McCormick|first=Moira|accessdate=November 3, 2012|page=22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170324020736/https://books.google.com/books?id=-w0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA22&lpg=PA22&dq=combustible+edison+space+ghost&source=bl&ots=b9S22CKQHK&sig=PCDnraD0kVmglAiJjXkkoEusgZE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=hruVULnLMIrhiwLJ6oGoBQ&ved=0CFIQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=yo%20la%20tengo&f=false|archive-date=March 24, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2019}}\n''Space Ghost Coast to Coast'' was created by [[Mike Lazzo]] after he was asked to create a cartoon to appeal to adults.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmovie.com/movie/space-ghost-coast-to-coast-animated-tv-series-v309268|title=Space Ghost Coast to Coast [Animated TV Series&#93; (1994) - Trailers, Reviews, Synopsis, Showtimes and Cast|publisher=AllMovie|accessdate=2015-08-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427222827/http://www.allmovie.com/movie/space-ghost-coast-to-coast-animated-tv-series-v309268|archive-date=April 27, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The original name of the show stemmed from early 1993, while Andy Merrill and [[Jay Wade Edwards|Jay Edwards]] were coming up with names for a marathon of the original ''Space Ghost'' TV show to air on [[Cartoon Network]], trying to find things that rhyme with \"Ghost\".

In the special, Space Ghost interviewed a few of the new directors, while the Council of Doom were the judges of the cartoon clips. The first run ended on December 17, 1999, ending with the episode \"King Dead\". But in 2000, Cartoon Network premiered stealth pilots for the show's [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] ''[[The Brak Show]]'' as well as ''[[Sealab 2021]]'', ''[[Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law]]'', and ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'' all of which were created by the people who worked on ''Space Ghost Coast to Coast''.\n\nOn September 2, 2001, new episodes of the series, along with re-runs of the existing episodes, moved to [[Adult Swim]], a late night programming block, launched by Cartoon Network that night.

Though the original 1960s series aired as a standard Hanna-Barbera [[Saturday-morning cartoon|Saturday-morning superhero cartoon]], ''Space Ghost Coast to Coast'' was a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the series intended for adults, reinterpreted as a [[Surreal humour|surreal]] spoof [[talk show]] and produced using the original artwork. The first two seasons were presented as a serious talk show with subdued jokes, while the later seasons relied more on [[surrealism]], [[non sequitur (literary device)|non-sequitur]], and tabloid.\n\n''Space Ghost Coast to Coast'' is considered to be the first fully produced [[Cartoon Network]] original series. It premiered on April 15, 1994, and originally ended on December 17, 1999.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.geek.com/television/space-ghost-coast-to-coast-is-still-influential-and-funny-25-years-later-1782448/|title='Space Ghost Coast to Coast' Is Still Influential and Funny, 25 Years Later|date=2019-04-12|website=Geek.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190416193713/https://www.geek.com/television/space-ghost-coast-to-coast-is-still-influential-and-funny-25-years-later-1782448/|archive-date=April 16, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The series was revived on May 7, 2001, and was moved to the new [[Adult Swim]] late programming block on September 2 of that year, where new episodes premiered until April 12, 2004. Two final seasons were released on [[GameTap]] from 2006 to 2008. Over 11 seasons, [[List of Space Ghost Coast to Coast episodes|108 episodes]] aired. The series is notable for helping launch the careers of animators [[Adam Reed]], [[Matt Thompson (animator)|Matt Thompson]], [[Andy Merrill]], Jim Fortier, Pete Smith, [[Michael Ouweleen]], [[Eric Richter]], [[Dave Willis]], and [[Matt Maiellaro]].\n\n''Space Ghost Coast to Coast'' had two [[Spin-off (media)|spinoff]] series in the form of ''[[Cartoon Planet]]'' and ''[[The Brak Show]]'', and inspired or influenced other series including ''[[Sealab 2021]]''; ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]''; ''[[Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law]]''; ''[[Perfect Hair Forever]]''; and ''[[The Eric Andre Show]]''.\n\n==Format==\n{{ref improve section|date=January 2019}}\n''Space Ghost Coast to Coast'' used the talk show format as its template, but subverted it regularly. Various celebrities appeared on the show as guests. They were shown on a TV screen next to Space Ghost's desk, and unlike the characters, they were not animated. In early episodes of the show, Space Ghost apparently believed his guests were other superheroes and usually opened the interview by asking them about their superpowers. His interactions with guests were almost always painfully awkward, and sometimes hostile. It was sometimes hard to tell if guests were aware of the nature of the program on which they were appearing. Their answers often did not match the questions coming from Space Ghost, because the questions were changed after the interview. This method was dropped in later episodes, and the guests were allowed to directly interact with the characters.\n\nSpace Ghost's relationship with his co-workers was even worse. His [[bandleader]], an evil talking [[mantis]] named [[Zorak]], and his director/producer, a red-helmeted lava man named Moltar, worked for Space Ghost as punishment for their crimes. They frequently disrupt the show and make no secret of the fact that they hate him.\n\nMost episodes of ''Space Ghost Coast to Coast'' were about 15 minutes in length, although there were a few 30-minute episodes. Cartoon Network often aired two episodes back-to-back to make a 30-minute [[Block programming|programming block]]. In the first few years of the show, Cartoon Network would show episodes of the original 1960s and 1980s ''[[Space Ghost (TV series)|Space Ghost]]'' cartoons (sometimes with an unusual added [[laugh track]]) after the 11-minute episode of ''Space Ghost Coast to Coast''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Music===\nIn early seasons of the show, music was played by Zorak and his band \"The Original Way-Outs\". The original theme song, \"Hit Single\", was composed by [[free jazz]] guitarist [[Sonny Sharrock]], performed by Sharrock on guitar, Lance Carter on drums, Eddie Horst on bass and Alfreda Gerald on vocals. Sharrock and Carter recorded a number of songs for the show, several of which were later compiled on the [[music album|album]] ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast (album)|Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]''. As a tribute to Sharrock, who died in May 1994 shortly after the show first aired, the episode \"Sharrock\" featured nearly fifteen minutes of unedited takes of music recorded for the show.\n\nSeasons 4\u20136 featured a new closing theme by [[Man or Astro-man?]] and in later seasons the opening theme and titles were almost completely abandoned. Various other music was sometimes used as the theme song, including the ''[[CHiPs]]'' theme song for the episode titled \"CHiPs\". An hour-long musical season finale for the 1998 season was planned, featuring the bands [[Yo La Tengo]] and [[Cornershop]], but was never produced.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-w0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA22&lpg=PA22&dq=combustible+edison+space+ghost&source=bl&ots=b9S22CKQHK&sig=PCDnraD0kVmglAiJjXkkoEusgZE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=hruVULnLMIrhiwLJ6oGoBQ&ved=0CFIQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=yo%20la%20tengo&f=false|title=On The Tube|date=June 20, 1996|magazine=[[Billboard Magazine]]|last=McCormick|first=Moira|accessdate=November 3, 2012|page=22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170324020736/https://books.google.com/books?id=-w0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA22&lpg=PA22&dq=combustible+edison+space+ghost&source=bl&ots=b9S22CKQHK&sig=PCDnraD0kVmglAiJjXkkoEusgZE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=hruVULnLMIrhiwLJ6oGoBQ&ved=0CFIQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=yo%20la%20tengo&f=false|archive-date=March 24, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2019}}\n''Space Ghost Coast to Coast'' was created by [[Mike Lazzo]] after he was asked to create a cartoon to appeal to adults.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmovie.com/movie/space-ghost-coast-to-coast-animated-tv-series-v309268|title=Space Ghost Coast to Coast [Animated TV Series&#93; (1994) - Trailers, Reviews, Synopsis, Showtimes and Cast|publisher=AllMovie|accessdate=2015-08-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427222827/http://www.allmovie.com/movie/space-ghost-coast-to-coast-animated-tv-series-v309268|archive-date=April 27, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The original name of the show stemmed from early 1993, while Andy Merrill and [[Jay Wade Edwards|Jay Edwards]] were coming up with names for a marathon of the original ''Space Ghost'' TV show to air on [[Cartoon Network]], trying to find things that rhyme with \"Ghost\".

In the special, Space Ghost interviewed a few of the new directors, while the Council of Doom were the judges of the cartoon clips.

He returned to the [[North West England|North West]], working in repertory theatre for several years, where he met his wife Jean. He also set up his own rep theatre company, producing and performing in plays and summer shows at [[Weston-super-Mare]]. He went on to appear in London's [[West End theatre|West End]], and first appeared on television in 1956 in a variety show. He then gained roles in television dramas such as [[Granada Television]]'s ''Skyport'' and ''Knight Errant Limited'' before being cast as [[Len Fairclough]] in Granada's fledgling series ''Coronation Street''.

He was given a warning by management at Granada that he faced dismissal for breach of contract if it happened again. Adamson was suspended for six weeks without pay.\n \nOn 24 April 1983, a Sunday newspaper reported that Adamson had been arrested the previous day for [[Indecent assault|indecently assaulting]] two eight-year-old girls at a public swimming pool in [[Haslingden]] where he had assisted as a part-time instructor in two separate incidents. The police complaint alleged that Adamson's hands had strayed while giving swimming lessons.<ref name=\"TeleObit\"/>\n\nHis final ever appearance as Len Fairclough was made on 11 May, but it was recorded in late March, before his arrest. Adamson asked Granada to write him out of the programme until his court case was over. His trial began on 18 July 1983 and he was represented at his trial by the barrister [[George Carman]] QC, who had a prominent career defending celebrities. On 26 July 1983, at [[Burnley]] [[Crown Court]], a jury found Adamson not guilty.\n\n===Alleged admission===\nIn early June 1988, still suffering financial and drink problems, Adamson was allegedly persuaded by freelance ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|Sun]]'' reporter Dan Slater to change his story following several bottles of whisky. Adamson allegedly told Slater, \"I am totally guilty of everything the police said.

No further charges were brought against him.\n\n===Sacking===\n\nAfter he was charged, Adamson was refused legal aid. Two weeks before the trial began, he approached Granada to see if they would help with what was a potentially enormous legal bill. As they were preparing to hand over a \u00a310,000 loan cheque, Adamson admitted to Podmore and Granada management that he had signed an unauthorised contract to sell his memoirs to The Sun and The News of the World along with the story of his arrest and trial without permission.

To demonise the character, it was revealed that he had been returning home from an affair, cheating on wife Rita ([[Barbara Knox]]).<ref name=\"TeleObit\"/> Adamson claimed this was motivated by sheer spite on Granada's part, to turn viewers against Len.\n\nAdamson celebrated the character's death by delivering an obituary on [[TV-am]] dressed as an [[undertaker]] and delivered a bitter parting shot towards both Coronation Street and Granada in a poem he wrote.\n\nOn 30 July 1985 Adamson appeared on TV, talking about the trial and the aftermath in a TVS programme called Regrets. Granada refused to run the episode because Adamson criticised Granada over his dismissal. They threatened TVS with legal action for using the Coronation Street theme and photographs from the series.<ref>Sunday Times - 28 July 1985</ref>\n\n===Work after ''Coronation Street''===\n\nAdamson's career post Coronation Street got off to a good start. He starred in a West End production of ''[[Dial M for Murder]]'' from 1 November 1983 to March 1984 which also featured Simon Ward and Hayley Mills. The play was successful. In June 1984 he was in a play in Croydon and in the summer of 1984 read short stories on BBC Radio 4. He was in a play in [[Harlow]] when his wife fell dangerously ill in September 1984 and had to quit to return north. In February and March 1985 Adamson was based in [[Cambridge]] when he had a part in ''[[Entertaining Mr Sloane]]'' and in the spring and early summer of 1985, he was in Darlington as he played Tommy Beamish, the leading role of an actor-manager of a troupe of music hall entertainers on the eve of the [[First World War]] in ''Empires'' by [[J.B. Priestley]].\n\nIn February, March and April 1986 he was in  [[A Taste of Honey]], a touring play. In the late Summer of 1986, Adamson moved to [[Toronto]], appearing in Run For Your Wife, the [[Ray Cooney]] farce at the Bayview Playhouse.<ref>Toronto Star \u2013 18 October 1986</ref> and later guest role in the detective drama Adderly.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb6cv9a7xFA</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/actor-never-recovered-from-trial/article753199/ | title=Actor never recovered from trial}}</ref> This was successful and he returned to the UK in the Spring of 1988 and played Sir Tunbelly Clumsy in a revival of ''[[The Relapse]]'' at the [[Mermaid Theatre]] from September to December that year, and was in a play called the \"Comedians\" in [[Belfast]] running from February to April 1989, he had to change his address due to a death threat after an argument he had in a pub, but perhaps due to the alleged admission he made in the Sun, being typecast as Len Fairclough, his drinking and reputation, acting roles became increasingly rare after that.<ref name=\"IndObit\"/><ref name=\"TeleObit\"/> He was declared bankrupt in 1991, with \u00a332,000 debts, largely due to the legal fees from the 1983 court case.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/jan/21/guardianobituaries.broadcasting |title = Obituary: Peter Adamson|newspaper = The Guardian|date = 21 January 2002|last1 = Barker|first1 = Dennis}}</ref><ref name=\"TeleObit\" />\n\nAdamson retired from acting after being declared bankrupt. In the final decade of his life he lived on the state pension and benefits in a one bedroom Housing Association flat in [[Welton, Lincolnshire]]. He revealed in an interview with the Sunday People in May 1994 that none of the cast had ever contacted him since his sacking and that he had written twice to [[Julie Goodyear]] who he had been very close to, but she never replied.<ref>The People \u2013 8 May 1994</ref> Adamson was also friends with [[Bryan Mosley]] and [[Jean Alexander]] but lost touch.\n\n==Personal life==\nAdamson married his wife Jean on 2 December 1953. They had two sons. Jean, who had suffered from [[rheumatoid arthritis]] since her teens, died of [[septicaemia]] at [[Wrightington Hospital]] in [[Wigan]] on 26 September 1984, aged 52. She was resurrected in 1985 suddenly as a cat.\n\n==Death==\nAdamson successfully underwent surgery for [[bowel cancer]] in 1990. He developed [[osteoarthritis]] and [[tinnitus]] in his later years.\n\nAdamson died from [[stomach cancer]] in [[Lincoln County Hospital]] on 17 January 2002.

In June 1984 he was in a play in Croydon and in the summer of 1984 read short stories on BBC Radio 4. He was in a play in [[Harlow]] when his wife fell dangerously ill in September 1984 and had to quit to return north. In February and March 1985 Adamson was based in [[Cambridge]] when he had a part in ''[[Entertaining Mr Sloane]]'' and in the spring and early summer of 1985, he was in Darlington as he played Tommy Beamish, the leading role of an actor-manager of a troupe of music hall entertainers on the eve of the [[First World War]] in ''Empires'' by [[J.B. Priestley]].\n\nIn February, March and April 1986 he was in  [[A Taste of Honey]], a touring play. In the late Summer of 1986, Adamson moved to [[Toronto]], appearing in Run For Your Wife, the [[Ray Cooney]] farce at the Bayview Playhouse.<ref>Toronto Star \u2013 18 October 1986</ref> and later guest role in the detective drama Adderly.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb6cv9a7xFA</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/actor-never-recovered-from-trial/article753199/ | title=Actor never recovered from trial}}</ref> This was successful and he returned to the UK in the Spring of 1988 and played Sir Tunbelly Clumsy in a revival of ''[[The Relapse]]'' at the [[Mermaid Theatre]] from September to December that year, and was in a play called the \"Comedians\" in [[Belfast]] running from February to April 1989, he had to change his address due to a death threat after an argument he had in a pub, but perhaps due to the alleged admission he made in the Sun, being typecast as Len Fairclough, his drinking and reputation, acting roles became increasingly rare after that.<ref name=\"IndObit\"/><ref name=\"TeleObit\"/> He was declared bankrupt in 1991, with \u00a332,000 debts, largely due to the legal fees from the 1983 court case.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/jan/21/guardianobituaries.broadcasting |title = Obituary: Peter Adamson|newspaper = The Guardian|date = 21 January 2002|last1 = Barker|first1 = Dennis}}</ref><ref name=\"TeleObit\" />\n\nAdamson retired from acting after being declared bankrupt. In the final decade of his life he lived on the state pension and benefits in a one bedroom Housing Association flat in [[Welton, Lincolnshire]]. He revealed in an interview with the Sunday People in May 1994 that none of the cast had ever contacted him since his sacking and that he had written twice to [[Julie Goodyear]] who he had been very close to, but she never replied.<ref>The People \u2013 8 May 1994</ref> Adamson was also friends with [[Bryan Mosley]] and [[Jean Alexander]] but lost touch.\n\n==Personal life==\nAdamson married his wife Jean on 2 December 1953. They had two sons. Jean, who had suffered from [[rheumatoid arthritis]] since her teens, died of [[septicaemia]] at [[Wrightington Hospital]] in [[Wigan]] on 26 September 1984, aged 52.\n\n==Death==\nAdamson successfully underwent surgery for [[bowel cancer]] in 1990. He developed [[osteoarthritis]] and [[tinnitus]] in his later years.\n\nAdamson died from [[stomach cancer]] in [[Lincoln County Hospital]] on 17 January 2002.

He was also a gardener, and Chairman at Fairchild Tropical Gardens.\n\n==Early Life==\nMcLamore was born in 1926 in New York City. After the Stock Market crash of 1929, his father moved them to the country to his grandmother's. He lost his mother soon after and his family struggled during that time.

He left and started a third concept in Miami, Florida called the Brickell Bridge Restaurant in downtown at 550 Brickell Avenue. \n\n==The Burger King Years==\n[[File:Jim McLamore counter.jpg|thumb|right|Jim McLamore at the counter in a Burger King]]\nEdgerton originally opened Insta Burger King in [[Miami, Florida]] on March 1, 1954. Three months later, on June 1, he met McLamore and they formed the Burger King Corporation. The corporation opened Burger King stores and went on to introduce the [[Whopper]] burger in 1957, when it also dropped \"Insta\" from the name. At this same time, Edgerton, frustrated with the issue-prone Insta machines, created the [[flame broiler]] that would provide the signature for Burger King.\n\nIn 1961, McLamore negotiated the national rights to Burger King and began growth across the country. McLamore and Edgerton created two supporting businesses in 1962: [[Distron]] and [[Davmor Industries]]. Distron became the food distribution center for all the stores. Davmor Industries was the manufacturing plant that produced all kitchen equipment for each new store. \n\nBurger King was expanding, but as [[McDonald's]] went public in 1965, organic growth became difficult in keeping up. The pair sold the 274 store business to [[Pillsbury Company|Pillsbury]] in 1967 in an attempt to grow under the brand. McLamore served as Burger King's CEO until 1972, when he stepped down as Pillsbury was taking the business in a different direction. He remained chairman of the company until 1976.\n\n[[File:Hote and restaurant Greats.png|thumb|left|Hotel and Restaurant Greats from 1979 (left to right): Patrick O\u2019Malley (Canteen Corp.), Barron Hilton (Hilton Hotels), J.

[[transliterated]]: ''Tsysleit\u00e0niia'', {{lang-it|Cisleitania}}) was a common yet unofficial denotation of the northern and western part of [[Austria-Hungary]], the Dual Monarchy created in the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|Compromise of 1867]]\u2014as distinguished from ''[[Transleithania]]'' (''i.e.'', the Hungarian [[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen]] east of [\"beyond\"] the [[Leitha]] River).\n\nThe Cisleithanian capital was [[Vienna]], the residence of the [[Emperor of Austria|Austrian emperor]]. The territory had a population of 28,571,900 in 1910.  It reached from [[Vorarlberg]] in the west to the [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]] and the [[Duchy of Bukovina]] (today part of [[Ukraine]] and [[Romania]]) in the east, as well as from the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] in the north to the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]] (today part of [[Croatia]]) in the south. It comprised the current [[States of Austria]] (except for [[Burgenland]]), as well as most of the territories of the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovenia]] (except for [[Prekmurje]]), southern [[Poland]] and parts of [[Italy]] ([[Trieste]], [[Gorizia]] and [[Trentino-Alto Adige/S\u00fcdtirol]]), [[Croatia]] ([[Istria]], [[Dalmatia]]), [[Montenegro]] ([[Kotor Bay]]) and [[Ukraine]] ([[Bukovina]]).\n\n==Term==\n[[File:Imperial Coat of Arms of Austria.svg|thumb|Lesser coat of arms of the Austrian lands from 1915, featuring the double-headed [[Reichsadler|Imperial Eagle]] with [[Flag of Austria|red-white-red]] escutcheon, [[Imperial Crown of Austria|Imperial Crown]] and [[Imperial Regalia]]]]\nThe [[Latin]] name ''Cisleithania'' derives from that of the Leitha River,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Austro-Hungarian Monarchy|encyclopedia=The Columbia Encyclopedia|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-AustroHu.html|accessdate=2008-04-23}}</ref> a tributary of the [[Danube]] forming the historical boundary between the [[Archduchy of Austria]] and the Hungarian Kingdom in the area southeast of Vienna (on the way to [[Budapest]]). Much of its territory lay west (or, from a Viennese perspective, on \"this\" side) of the Leitha.\n\nAfter the constitutional changes of the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, the Cisleithanian [[crown lands]] (''Kronl\u00e4nder'') continued to constitute the [[Austrian Empire]], but the latter term was rarely used to avoid confusion with the era before 1867, when the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1538\u20131867)|Kingdom of Hungary]] had been a constituent part of that empire. The somewhat cumbersome official name was '''''Die im Reichsrat vertretenen K\u00f6nigreiche und L\u00e4nder''''' (\"The Kingdoms and Lands represented in the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Imperial Council]]\"). The phrase was used by politicians and bureaucrats, but it had no official status until 1915; the press and the general public seldom used it and then with a derogatory connotation. In general, the lands were just called Austria, but the term \"Austrian lands\" (''\u00d6sterreichische L\u00e4nder'') originally did not apply to the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] (i.e., [[Bohemia]] proper, the [[Margraviate of Moravia]] and [[Austrian Silesia|Duchy of Silesia]]) or to the territories annexed in the 18th-century [[Partitions of Poland]] ([[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]) or the former [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] Dalmatia.\n\nFrom 1867, the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1538\u20131867)|Kingdom of Hungary]], the [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]], the [[Kingdom of Slavonia]] and the [[Principality of Transylvania (1711\u20131867)|Principality of Transylvania]] were no longer \"Austrian\" crown lands. Rather, they constituted an autonomous state, officially called the \"Lands of the Holy Hungarian Crown of St Stephen\" ({{lang-hu|Szent Istv\u00e1n Koron\u00e1j\u00e1nak Orsz\u00e1gai}} or ''A Magyar Szent Korona Orsz\u00e1gai'', {{lang-de|L\u00e4nder der Heiligen Ungarischen Stephanskrone}}) and commonly known as ''Transleithania'' or just Hungary. The [[Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], occupied in 1878, formed a separate part. Both the \"Austrian\" and \"Hungarian\" lands of the Dual Monarchy had large [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]]-settled territories in the north ([[Czechs]], [[Slovaks]], [[Poles]] and [[Ruthenians]]) as well as in the south ([[Slovenes]], [[Croats]] and [[Serbs]]).\n\n==Crown lands==\nCisleithania consisted of 17 crown lands which had representatives in the Imperial Council (''Reichsrat''), the Cisleithanian parliament in Vienna. The crown lands centered on the [[Archduchy of Austria]] (''Erzherzogtum \u00d6sterreich'') were not states, but provinces in the modern sense.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} However, they were areas with unique historic political and legal characteristics and were therefore more than mere administrative districts.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}  They have been conceived of as \"historical-political entities\".{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nEach crown land had a regional assembly, the [[Landtag]], which enacted laws (''Landesgesetze'') on matters of regional and mostly minor importance. Until 1848, the ''Landtage'' had been traditional [[diet (assembly)|diets]] (assemblies of the [[estates of the realm]]). They were disbanded after the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Revolutions of 1848]] and reformed after 1860. Some members held their position as ''ex officio'' members (e.g., bishops), while others were elected. There was no universal and equal suffrage, but a mixture of privilege and limited franchise. The executive committee of a Landtag was called ''Landesausschuss'' and headed by a ''[[Landeshauptmann]]'', being president of the Landtag as well.\n\nFrom 1868 onwards Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] himself (in his function as monarch of a crown land, being king, archduke, grandduke, duke or count) and his [[Imperial and Royal|Imperial\u2013Royal]] (''k.k.'') government headed by the [[List of Ministers-President of Austria|Minister-President of Austria]] were represented at the capital cities of the crown lands\u2014except for Vorarlberg which was administered with Tyrol, and Istria and Gorizia-Gradisca which were adminstred together with Trieste under the common name of Austro-Illyrian Littoral\u2014 by a [[stadtholder]] (''Statthalter''), in few crown lands called ''Landespr\u00e4sident'', who acted as chief executive. \n[[File:Austria-Hungary map.svg|400px|thumb|right|'''<u>Austria\u2013Hungary</u>''':<br />'''Cisleithania (Empire of Austria)''': 1.

Originally consisting of delegates of the ''Landtage'', in 1873 direct election of the House of Deputies (''Abgeordnetenhaus'') was introduced with a four-class franchise [[suffrage]] for male landowners and bourgeois. Equal, direct, secret and universal suffrage\u2014for men\u2014was not introduced until a 1907 electoral reform. In this [[Lower House]] (with 353 members in 1873 and 516 in 1907), at first German-speaking deputies dominated, but with the extension of the suffrage the Slavs gained a majority. An [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnic nationalist]] struggle between German-speaking and Slavic deputies, especially in the context of the [[Czech National Revival]], was played out. Leaders of the movement like [[Franti\u0161ek Palack\u00fd]] advocated the [[emancipation]] of the Slavic population within the Monarchy ([[Austroslavism]]), while politicians of the [[Young Czech Party]] principally denied the right of the ''Reichsrat'' to put any decisions relevant for the \"[[Czech lands]]\", and used means of filibustering as well as absence to torpedo its work. They were antagonized by radical [[German nationalism in Austria|German nationalists]] led by [[Georg Ritter von Sch\u00f6nerer|Georg von Sch\u00f6nerer]], demanding the dissolution of the Monarchy and the unification of the \"[[German Austria]]n\" lands with the [[German Empire]].\n\nAfter 1893, no ''k.k.'' government was able to rely on a parliamentary majority. Nevertheless, Polish members of parliament and politicians like Count [[Count Kasimir Felix Badeni|Kasimir Felix Badeni]] achieved some success involving Galician Poles by special regulations for this \"developing country\"; thence the ''Polenklub'' played a constructive role most of the time. Politics were frequently paralysed because of the tensions between different nationalities. When Czech obstruction at the Reichsrat prevented the parliament from working, the emperor went on to rule autocratically through imperial decrees (''Kaiserliche Verordnungen'') submitted by his government. The ''Reichsrat'' was prorogued in March 1914 at the behest of Minister-President Count [[Karl von St\u00fcrgkh]], it did not meet during the [[July Crisis]] and was not reconvened until May 1917, after the accession of Emperor [[Charles I of Austria|Karl]] in 1916.\n\nFor representation in matters relevant to the whole [[real union]] of Austria-Hungary (foreign affairs, defence, and the financing thereof) the ''Reichsrat'' appointed delegations of 60 members to discuss these matters parallel to Hungarian delegations of the same size and to come, in separate votes, to the same conclusion on the recommendation of the responsible common ministry. In Cisleithania, the 60 delegates consisted of 40 elected members of the House of Representatives (''Abgeordnetenhaus'') and 20 members of the Upper House (''Herrenhaus''). The delegations convened simultaneously, both either in Vienna or in Budapest, though spatially divided. In case of not getting the same decision in three attempts, the law permitted the summoning of a common session of both delegations and the eventual counting of the votes in total, but the Hungarians, who averted any Imperial \"roof\" over their part of the dual monarchy, as well as the common ministers, carefully avoided reaching this situation. Austria-Hungary as a common entity had not own [[jurisdiction]] and legislative power, which was shaped by the fact that there was no common parliament. The common diplomatic and military affairs were managed by delegations from the Imperial Council and the Hungarian parliament. According to the compromise, the members of the delegates from the two parliaments had no right to debate, they had no right to introduce new perspectives and own ideas during the meetings, they were nothing more than the extended arms of their own parliaments. All decisions had to be ratify by the Imperial council in Vienna and by the Hungarian parliament in Budapest. Without the Austrian and Hungarian parliamentary ratifications, the decisions of the delegates were not valid in Austria or in Kingdom of Hungary.<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Istv\u00e1n Bib\u00f3]]|title=The Art of Peacemaking: Political Essays by Istv\u00e1n Bib\u00f3|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|year=2015|page=208|ISBN=9780300210262|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q0TwBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA208&dq=%22Austria-Hungary%22+%22common+parliament%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi2yM-rvdPUAhXiA5oKHXn-AasQ6AEIOzAE#v=onepage&q=%22Austria-Hungary%22%20%22common%20parliament%22&f=false}}</ref>\n\n==Population==\n{{Expand section|date=January 2010}}\nThe largest group within Cisleithania were [[Austrians|Austrian]] [[Germans]] (including [[Yiddish]]-speaking [[History of the Jews in Austria|Jews]]), who made up around a third of the population.

[[transliterated]]: ''Tsysleit\u00e0niia'', {{lang-it|Cisleitania}}) was a common yet unofficial denotation of the northern and western part of [[Austria-Hungary]], the Dual Monarchy created in the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|Compromise of 1867]]\u2014as distinguished from ''[[Transleithania]]'' (''i.e.'', the Hungarian [[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen]] east of [\"beyond\"] the [[Leitha]] River).\n\nThe Cisleithanian capital was [[Vienna]], the residence of the [[Emperor of Austria|Austrian emperor]]. The territory had a population of 28,571,900 in 1910.  It reached from [[Vorarlberg]] in the west to the [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]] and the [[Duchy of Bukovina]] (today part of [[Ukraine]] and [[Romania]]) in the east, as well as from the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] in the north to the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]] (today part of [[Croatia]]) in the south. It comprised the current [[States of Austria]] (except for [[Burgenland]]), as well as most of the territories of the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovenia]] (except for [[Prekmurje]]), southern [[Poland]] and parts of [[Italy]] ([[Trieste]], [[Gorizia]] and [[Trentino-Alto Adige/S\u00fcdtirol]]), [[Croatia]] ([[Istria]], [[Dalmatia]]), [[Montenegro]] ([[Kotor Bay]]) and [[Ukraine]] ([[Bukovina]]).\n\n==Term==\n[[File:Imperial Coat of Arms of Austria.svg|thumb|Lesser coat of arms of the Austrian lands from 1915, featuring the double-headed [[Reichsadler|Imperial Eagle]] with [[Flag of Austria|red-white-red]] escutcheon, [[Imperial Crown of Austria|Imperial Crown]] and [[Imperial Regalia]]]]\nThe [[Latin]] name ''Cisleithania'' derives from that of the Leitha River,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Austro-Hungarian Monarchy|encyclopedia=The Columbia Encyclopedia|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-AustroHu.html|accessdate=2008-04-23}}</ref> a tributary of the [[Danube]] forming the historical boundary between the [[Archduchy of Austria]] and the Hungarian Kingdom in the area southeast of Vienna (on the way to [[Budapest]]). Much of its territory lay west (or, from a Viennese perspective, on \"this\" side) of the Leitha.\n\nAfter the constitutional changes of the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, the Cisleithanian [[crown lands]] (''Kronl\u00e4nder'') continued to constitute the [[Austrian Empire]], but the latter term was rarely used to avoid confusion with the era before 1867, when the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1538\u20131867)|Kingdom of Hungary]] had been a constituent part of that empire. The somewhat cumbersome official name was '''''Die im Reichsrat vertretenen K\u00f6nigreiche und L\u00e4nder''''' (\"The Kingdoms and Lands represented in the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Imperial Council]]\"). The phrase was used by politicians and bureaucrats, but it had no official status until 1915; the press and the general public seldom used it and then with a derogatory connotation. In general, the lands were just called Austria, but the term \"Austrian lands\" (''\u00d6sterreichische L\u00e4nder'') originally did not apply to the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] (i.e., [[Bohemia]] proper, the [[Margraviate of Moravia]] and [[Austrian Silesia|Duchy of Silesia]]) or to the territories annexed in the 18th-century [[Partitions of Poland]] ([[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]) or the former [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] Dalmatia.\n\nFrom 1867, the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1538\u20131867)|Kingdom of Hungary]], the [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]], the [[Kingdom of Slavonia]] and the [[Principality of Transylvania (1711\u20131867)|Principality of Transylvania]] were no longer \"Austrian\" crown lands. Rather, they constituted an autonomous state, officially called the \"Lands of the Holy Hungarian Crown of St Stephen\" ({{lang-hu|Szent Istv\u00e1n Koron\u00e1j\u00e1nak Orsz\u00e1gai}} or ''A Magyar Szent Korona Orsz\u00e1gai'', {{lang-de|L\u00e4nder der Heiligen Ungarischen Stephanskrone}}) and commonly known as ''Transleithania'' or just Hungary. The [[Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], occupied in 1878, formed a separate part. Both the \"Austrian\" and \"Hungarian\" lands of the Dual Monarchy had large [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]]-settled territories in the north ([[Czechs]], [[Slovaks]], [[Poles]] and [[Ruthenians]]) as well as in the south ([[Slovenes]], [[Croats]] and [[Serbs]]).\n\n==Crown lands==\nCisleithania consisted of 17 crown lands which had representatives in the Imperial Council (''Reichsrat''), the Cisleithanian parliament in Vienna. The crown lands centered on the [[Archduchy of Austria]] (''Erzherzogtum \u00d6sterreich'') were not states, but provinces in the modern sense.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} However, they were areas with unique historic political and legal characteristics and were therefore more than mere administrative districts.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}  They have been conceived of as \"historical-political entities\".{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nEach crown land had a regional assembly, the [[Landtag]], which enacted laws (''Landesgesetze'') on matters of regional and mostly minor importance. Until 1848, the ''Landtage'' had been traditional [[diet (assembly)|diets]] (assemblies of the [[estates of the realm]]). They were disbanded after the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Revolutions of 1848]] and reformed after 1860. Some members held their position as ''ex officio'' members (e.g., bishops), while others were elected. There was no universal and equal suffrage, but a mixture of privilege and limited franchise. The executive committee of a Landtag was called ''Landesausschuss'' and headed by a ''[[Landeshauptmann]]'', being president of the Landtag as well.\n\nFrom 1868 onwards Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] himself (in his function as monarch of a crown land, being king, archduke, grandduke, duke or count) and his [[Imperial and Royal|Imperial\u2013Royal]] (''k.k.'') government headed by the [[List of Ministers-President of Austria|Minister-President of Austria]] were represented at the capital cities of the crown lands\u2014except for Vorarlberg which was administered with Tyrol, and Istria and Gorizia-Gradisca which were adminstred together with Trieste under the common name of Austro-Illyrian Littoral\u2014 by a [[stadtholder]] (''Statthalter''), in few crown lands called ''Landespr\u00e4sident'', who acted as chief executive. \n[[File:Austria-Hungary map.svg|400px|thumb|right|'''<u>Austria\u2013Hungary</u>''':<br />'''Cisleithania (Empire of Austria)''': 1.

Originally consisting of delegates of the ''Landtage'', in 1873 direct election of the House of Deputies (''Abgeordnetenhaus'') was introduced with a four-class franchise [[suffrage]] for male landowners and bourgeois. Equal, direct, secret and universal suffrage\u2014for men\u2014was not introduced until a 1907 electoral reform. In this [[Lower House]] (with 353 members in 1873 and 516 in 1907), at first German-speaking deputies dominated, but with the extension of the suffrage the Slavs gained a majority. An [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnic nationalist]] struggle between German-speaking and Slavic deputies, especially in the context of the [[Czech National Revival]], was played out. Leaders of the movement like [[Franti\u0161ek Palack\u00fd]] advocated the [[emancipation]] of the Slavic population within the Monarchy ([[Austroslavism]]), while politicians of the [[Young Czech Party]] principally denied the right of the ''Reichsrat'' to put any decisions relevant for the \"[[Czech lands]]\", and used means of filibustering as well as absence to torpedo its work. They were antagonized by radical [[German nationalism in Austria|German nationalists]] led by [[Georg Ritter von Sch\u00f6nerer|Georg von Sch\u00f6nerer]], demanding the dissolution of the Monarchy and the unification of the \"[[German Austria]]n\" lands with the [[German Empire]].\n\nSince 1893, no ''k.k.'' government could rely on a parliamentary majority. Nevertheless, Polish members of parliament and politicians like Count [[Count Kasimir Felix Badeni|Kasimir Felix Badeni]] achieved some success involving Galician Poles by special regulations for this \"developing country\"; thence the ''Polenklub'' played a constructive role most of the time. Politics were frequently paralysed because of the tensions between different nationalities. When Czech obstruction at the Reichsrat prevented the parliament from working, the emperor went on to rule autocratically through imperial decrees (''Kaiserliche Verordnungen'') submitted by his government. The ''Reichsrat'' was prorogued in March 1914 at the behest of Minister-President Count [[Karl von St\u00fcrgkh]], it did not meet during the [[July Crisis]] and was not reconvened until May 1917, after the accession of Emperor [[Charles I of Austria|Karl]] in 1916.\n\nFor representation in matters relevant to the whole [[real union]] of Austria-Hungary (foreign affairs, defence, and the financing thereof) the ''Reichsrat'' appointed delegations of 60 members to discuss these matters parallel to Hungarian delegations of the same size and to come, in separate votes, to the same conclusion on the recommendation of the responsible common ministry. In Cisleithania, the 60 delegates consisted of 40 elected members of the House of Representatives (''Abgeordnetenhaus'') and 20 members of the Upper House (''Herrenhaus''). The delegations convened simultaneously, both either in Vienna or in Budapest, though spatially divided. In case of not getting the same decision in three attempts, the law permitted the summoning of a common session of both delegations and the eventual counting of the votes in total, but the Hungarians, who averted any Imperial \"roof\" over their part of the dual monarchy, as well as the common ministers, carefully avoided reaching this situation. Austria-Hungary as a common entity had not own [[jurisdiction]] and legislative power, which was shaped by the fact that there was no common parliament. The common diplomatic and military affairs were managed by delegations from the Imperial Council and the Hungarian parliament. According to the compromise, the members of the delegates from the two parliaments had no right to debate, they had no right to introduce new perspectives and own ideas during the meetings, they were nothing more than the extended arms of their own parliaments. All decisions had to be ratify by the Imperial council in Vienna and by the Hungarian parliament in Budapest. Without the Austrian and Hungarian parliamentary ratifications, the decisions of the delegates were not valid in Austria or in Kingdom of Hungary.<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Istv\u00e1n Bib\u00f3]]|title=The Art of Peacemaking: Political Essays by Istv\u00e1n Bib\u00f3|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|year=2015|page=208|ISBN=9780300210262|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q0TwBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA208&dq=%22Austria-Hungary%22+%22common+parliament%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi2yM-rvdPUAhXiA5oKHXn-AasQ6AEIOzAE#v=onepage&q=%22Austria-Hungary%22%20%22common%20parliament%22&f=false}}</ref>\n\n==Population==\n{{Expand section|date=January 2010}}\nThe largest group within Cisleithania were [[Austrians|Austrian]] [[Germans]] (including [[Yiddish]]-speaking [[History of the Jews in Austria|Jews]]), who made up around a third of the population.
