Thus, for many centuries the Chagos were ignored by their northern neighbours.\n\nThe islands of [[Chagos Archipelago]] were charted by [[Vasco da Gama]] in the early sixteenth century, then claimed in the eighteenth century by France as a possession of Mauritius.

The summary of the [[diplomatic cable]] is as follows:\n<blockquote>HMG would like to establish a \"marine park\" or \"reserve\" providing comprehensive environmental protection to the reefs and waters of the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT), a senior Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) official informed Polcouns on 12 May. The official insisted that the establishment of a marine park \u2013 the world's largest \u2013 would in no way impinge on USG use of the BIOT, including Diego Garcia, for military purposes. He agreed that the UK and U.S. should carefully negotiate the details of the marine reserve to assure that U.S. interests were safeguarded and the strategic value of BIOT was upheld. He said that the BIOT\u2019s former inhabitants would find it difficult, if not impossible, to pursue their claim for resettlement on the islands if the entire Chagos Archipelago were a marine reserve.</blockquote>\n\nThe UK government established a marine reserve in April 2010 to mixed reactions from Chagossians. While the UK Foreign Office claimed that it was an environmental move as well as a necessary move to improve the coral populations off east Africa and therefore sub-saharan marine supplies, some Chagossians claimed that the reserve would prevent any resettlement due to the inability to fish in protected areas. The Chagossian UK-based Diego Garcian Society stated that it welcomed the marine reserve, noting that it was in the interest of Chagossians to have the area protected while they were exiled and that it could be renegotiated upon resettlement. The Foreign Office claimed the reserve was made \"without prejudice to the outcome of the current, pending proceedings before the [[European Court of Human Rights]]\".<ref name=\"Reserve\">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8599125.stm |title=UK sets up Chagos Islands marine reserve |publisher=BBC News |date=1 April 2010 |accessdate=25 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn 1 December 2010, a leaked [[US Embassy London]] diplomatic cable exposed British and US communications in creating the marine nature reserve.

Thus, for many centuries the Chagos were ignored by their northern neighbours.\n\nThe islands of [[Chagos Archipelago]] were charted by [[Vasco da Gama]] in the early sixteenth century, then claimed in the eighteenth century by France as a possession of Mauritius.

The summary of the [[diplomatic cable]] is as follows:\n<blockquote>HMG would like to establish a \"marine park\" or \"reserve\" providing comprehensive environmental protection to the reefs and waters of the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT), a senior Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) official informed Polcouns on 12 May. The official insisted that the establishment of a marine park \u2013 the world's largest \u2013 would in no way impinge on USG use of the BIOT, including Diego Garcia, for military purposes. He agreed that the UK and U.S. should carefully negotiate the details of the marine reserve to assure that U.S. interests were safeguarded and the strategic value of BIOT was upheld. He said that the BIOT\u2019s former inhabitants would find it difficult, if not impossible, to pursue their claim for resettlement on the islands if the entire Chagos Archipelago were a marine reserve.</blockquote>\n\nThe UK government established a marine reserve in April 2010 to mixed reactions from Chagossians. While the UK Foreign Office claimed that it was an environmental move as well as a necessary move to improve the coral populations off east Africa and therefore sub-saharan marine supplies, some Chagossians claimed that the reserve would prevent any resettlement due to the inability to fish in protected areas. The Chagossian UK-based Diego Garcian Society stated that it welcomed the marine reserve, noting that it was in the interest of Chagossians to have the area protected while they were exiled and that it could be renegotiated upon resettlement. The Foreign Office claimed the reserve was made \"without prejudice to the outcome of the current, pending proceedings before the [[European Court of Human Rights]]\".<ref name=\"Reserve\">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8599125.stm |title=UK sets up Chagos Islands marine reserve |publisher=BBC News |date=1 April 2010 |accessdate=25 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn 1 December 2010, a leaked [[US Embassy London]] diplomatic cable exposed British and US communications in creating the marine nature reserve.

An amateur club station, VQ9X, was sponsored by the US Navy for use by operators both licensed in their home country and possessing a VQ9 callsign issued by the local British Indian Ocean Territory representative.<ref>{{cite web|title=VQ9X Club Station|url=http://www.qsl.net/vq9la/2.htm|work=QSL.NET|accessdate=20 September 2013|author=Arneson, Larry (VQ9LA)}}</ref> However, the US Navy closed the station in early 2013, hence any future licensed amateurs wishing to operate from the island will have to provide their own antenna and radio equipment.<ref>{{cite web|title=(Post of) May 24, 2013|url=https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=653189054707236&id=148071511885662|work=Official VQ9X Facebook page|accessdate=20 September 2013|author=Arneson, Larry (VQ9LA)}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Geography|Asia|South Asia|<!--Indian Ocean-->|United Kingdom|<!--British Indian Ocean Territory-->}}\n* [[Index of United Kingdom-related articles]]\n* [[British Overseas Territories]]\n* [[List of island countries and territories in the Indian Ocean]]\n* [[Ile Takamaka]]\n* [[British Indian Army]]\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n*Wenban-Smith, N. and Carter, M., ''Chagos: A History, Exploration, Exploitation, Expulsion'' Published by Chagos Conservation Trust, London (2016), {{ISBN|978-0-9954596-0-1}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|British Indian Ocean Territory}}\n{{Wiktionary|British Indian Ocean Territory}}\n{{Wikivoyage|British Indian Ocean Territory}}\n*[http://biot.gov.io/ Official website]\n*[https://www.gov.uk/government/world/british-indian-ocean-territory/ British Indian Ocean Territory on UK government site]\n* [http://www.chagos-trust.org/ The Chagos Conservation Trust \u2013 A non-political charity whose aims are to promote conservation, scientific and historical research, and to advance education concerning the archipelago.]\n* [http://www.diegogarciaonline.com/ Diego Garcia Online: Information for the Diego Garcia, BIOT population]\n* [http://www.factba.se/fco-page.php?bc=IO UK Foreign Office- profile]\n* {{CIA World Factbook link|io|British Indian Ocean Territory}}\n* [http://www.historycommons.org/timeline.jsp?timeline=diego_garcia Diego Garcia], timeline posted at the History Commons.\n* [http://www.law.northwestern.edu/journals/jihr/v5/n1/4/Nauvel.pdf Christian Nauvel, \"A Return from Exile in Sight?

During the [[New 52]], it is established that Kate Kane is a cousin of Batman's alter-ego Bruce Wayne and thus a niece of his mother [[Martha Wayne]].<ref>''Batwoman'' #25 (November 2013)</ref> Described as the highest-profile gay superhero to appear in stories published by DC, Batwoman's sexual orientation drew wide media attention following her reintroduction, as well as both praise and criticism from the general public.\n\nThe modern character as depicted in comics works relatively independently of Batman, but has gained considerable profile in recent years, both within the DC Comics publishing schedule and the publisher's [[DC Universe|fictional universe]]. She since had several runs in her own eponymous ''Batwoman'' monthly comic book and has had stints in the lead role in ''Detective Comics'', the flagship Batman comic book for which DC Comics is named. The Kate Kane version of Batwoman was later adapted to the animated film ''[[Batman: Bad Blood]]'', voiced by [[Yvonne Strahovski]]. [[Ruby Rose]] portrays the character in her live-action debut during the [[Arrowverse]] crossover \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\", later starring in her own [[Batwoman (TV series)|television series]] and the \"[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths]]\" crossover.\n\n==Publication history==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical \n | header = \n | width = 200\n | image1 = KateKane52week7.jpg\n | caption1 = Kate Kane's debut in ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' #7 (June 2006).

Subsequently, all comic book titles published by DC Comics skip forward [[One Year Later|one year]] and a new maxi-series entitled ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' retroactively chronicles the 52 weeks which directly followed ''Infinite Crisis''. When DC editors called for a redesign of Batwoman, comic book artist [[Alex Ross]] drew inspiration from the modified Batgirl costume he designed for Barbara Gordon, seven years prior to Kate Kane's debut in the limited comic book series ''52''. Ross and comic book author [[Paul Dini]] initially planned to revive the former Batgirl Barbara Gordon using an updated version of the character's original costume, with red accents in place of the traditional yellow. However, since Gordon served as one of a very small number of disabled superheroes of DC Comics as [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]], DC's editorial staff decided to revitalize the original Batwoman instead. In an interview with [[Newsarama]], Ross states, \"They had me change the mask and hair to make it a bit more Batwoman, rather than Batgirl...I pointed out to them that the mask makes her look like the [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]] a little overall\u2014but there weren't many options. The original mask that I had in there when it was to be a Batgirl design was the complete head cover that we've seen, so they did need something different from that.\"<ref name=\"newsarama ross\">{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=Dave |url=http://classic.newsarama.com/dcnew/52/Batwoman/BatwomanRoss.html |title=Alex Ross: Giving Batwoman Her Look |work=[[Newsarama]] |date=June 1, 2006 |accessdate=2007-09-12 }} {{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}</ref>\n\nUnlike the [[Silver Age of Comics|Silver Age]] Kathy Kane, who was romantically attracted to Batman, the new version of Kane is a lesbian,<ref>{{cite web |last=Robinson |first=Bryan |url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=2028464&page=1 |title=Holy Lipstick Lesbian!

No ''Origins'' titles have been presented for Kate Kane; her fictional backstory is presented in ''Detective Comics'' through the use of exposition and flashbacks. In their early childhood, Katherine Rebecca \"Kate\" Kane and her sister [[Beth Kane|Elizabeth \"Beth\" Kane]] were identical twins and were very close to each other. On their twelfth birthday, their military father [[Jacob Kane|Jacob \"Jake\" Kane]] could not come home to celebrate with them, so Kate and Beth were taken by their mother, Gabrielle \"Gabi\" Kane, to an expensive restaurant for chocolate and waffles, their favorite dish. On the way to the restaurant, a group of gunmen attacked the family and took them hostage, killing their bodyguard in the process. After learning of her family's kidnapping, Jacob Kane led a rescue mission to save his captured family, which ended with Kate's mother executed and Beth apparently killed after being caught in the crossfire between the kidnappers and soldiers.<ref name=\"DC858\">{{citation | last = Rucka | first = Greg | work = Detective Comics #858 | title = Go 1 | publisher = DC Comics | date = December 2009 | url = http://comicbookdb.com/issue.php?ID=183947 | access-date = 2013-03-16 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110821011128/http://comicbookdb.com/issue.php?ID=183947 | archive-date = 2011-08-21 | url-status = live }}</ref> Years later, Jake marries Catherine Hamilton Kane.\n\nKate is attending the [[United States Military Academy]], where she receives excellent grades, earns prestigious awards, and earns the rank of Brigade Executive Officer in her senior year; she also maintains a secret romantic relationship with her roommate, [[Sophie Moore]]. However, when she is anonymously accused of homosexual conduct, Kate's commanding officer asks her to disavow the allegation on account of her outstanding record, mentioning that if she does, she will be demoted but still be able to graduate. Telling the officer that she refuses to lie and violate the Honor Code of the Academy, Kate admits to being lesbian and is forced to leave the school.

Kate is eventually pulled over for speeding by a young Renee Montoya, who was just a traffic cop at this point. The two date for several months but break up following a fight where Renee expresses concern about Kate's lack of direction in her life and Kate berates Renee for keeping her sexuality hidden from her colleagues and family. While attempting to call Renee and apologize for her behavior, Kate is attacked by a mugger who wants her wallet and cell phone. Using her military training, Kate easily defeats the criminal just as Batman arrives and helps her off the ground. She is then shown fixated by the Bat Signal as Batman departs the scene.<ref name=\"DC859\"/>\n\nInspired by her encounter with the caped crusader, Kate begins fighting crime using military body armor and weaponry stolen from her father's military base; she operates for close to a year before her father finds out. After being confronted by Jacob, Kate accepts his offer for assistance and begins an intense two years of training across the globe with some of her father's friends from the [[special operations]] community. Upon returning to Gotham, Kate discovers that her father has created a [[Batsuit]] for her, along with an arsenal of experimental weaponry based on Batman's known gadgetry and a bunker hidden in the panic room in Kate's apartment.<ref name=\"DC860\">{{citation | last = Rucka | first = Greg | work = Detective Comics #860 | title = Go 3 | publisher = DC Comics | date = February 2010 | url = http://comicbookdb.com/issue.php?ID=188569 }}</ref>\n\nThe first reference to the modern Batwoman is made by the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]] in ''Detective Comics'' #824 who suggests Batman bring a date to the opening of his club, asking, \"Why don't you bring that new Batwoman?

In the first story, entitled \"[[Batwoman: Elegy|Elegy]]\", Batwoman is seen investigating the arrival of a new leader of the Religion of Crime to Gotham.

Kate demonstrates greater knowledge of the Religion of Crime, and even corrects Batman by saying there are 13 and not 12 covens of the religion in Gotham.

Her lateness and night time absences are interpreted by her girlfriend as an on the side liaison with another woman. She breaks the relationship off as she believes Kate is not ready to commit to an exclusive relationship. A past traumatic incident is also alluded to which she claims still haunts her. As she vaguely describes the experience, her face is shown superimposed on the page over a restrained girl with a bag over her head. She later tracks down the new leader of the Religion of Crime: an elaborately costumed woman named Alice.<ref name=\"DC854\" /> Over the course of the conflict that ensues, Batwoman observes that Alice only speaks in quotations from [[Lewis Carroll]], believing herself to be [[Alice Liddell]].

Kate is apparently unaware of her cousin's vigilante activities. While dancing with Maggie, Kate is approached by Kyle Abbot, a former employee of Bruno Mannheim who split from the Religion of Crime after the events of ''52''.

These scenes are depicted among numerous flashback sequences that comprise most of the issue. Throughout them, back story is provided from her childhood that depicts Kate, her twin sister Beth, and their mother being kidnapped. While Kate's father is able to rescue her, it appears as though both her sister and mother have been killed by the time he arrives.<ref name=\"DC858\"/>\n\nBatwoman appears in the miniseries ''Cry for Justice'', a set-up for a new ongoing ''Justice League'' title. When the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] splits up following Bruce Wayne's death and a disastrous confrontation with the [[Shadow Cabinet (comics)|Shadow Cabinet]], Green Lantern [[Hal Jordan]] leads a group of superheroes to Gotham in order to track down the supervillain known as [[Prometheus (DC Comics)|Prometheus]].

[[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] is then sent to retrieve the corpse from Kate and bring it to the team, who discover that Dolores was forced into fighting by means of a mind control device.<ref>''Justice League: Cry For Justice'' #5</ref> In a text piece included in ''[[Justice League: Cry for Justice]]'' #6, writer [[James Robinson (comics)|James Robinson]] revealed that Batwoman was initially intended to be part of his new Justice League line-up, but this plan fell apart after ''Cry For Justice'' was shortened into a miniseries rather than an ongoing title.<ref>''Justice League: Cry For Justice'' #6</ref> This explains why Batwoman is present on the cover of the first issue, and why she was initially said to be a member of the team when the book was first announced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_pScx8BN4h3s/Sdz03LNLSaI/AAAAAAAADV0/3ES0GY6tdO8/s320/wizard+202+1.jpg|title=Magazine cover picture|format=JPG|accessdate=28 December 2014|publisher=2.bp.blogspot.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150304221121/http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_pScx8BN4h3s/Sdz03LNLSaI/AAAAAAAADV0/3ES0GY6tdO8/s320/wizard+202+1.jpg|archive-date=2015-03-04|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nLater, Kate appears as part of ''[[Batman and Robin (comic book)|Batman and Robin]]: Blackest Knight''. Batwoman is kidnapped by cultists and taken to London in order for her to once again be sacrificed. She is sealed within a coffin and taken underground to the last remaining [[Lazarus Pit]] in order for the ritual to begin. She is saved by the timely intervention of Dick Grayson and British superheroes [[Knight (DC Comics)|Knight]] and [[Squire (comics)|Squire]]. After learning that Grayson plans on placing Bruce Wayne's corpse into the pit in order to revive him, Kate strongly protests, but he simply ignores her.<ref>''Batman and Robin'' #7 (January 2010)</ref> True to Kate's warnings, Bruce (in reality an insane clone created by [[Darkseid]]) emerges from the Pit and attacks the heroes. As the battle takes place, the cultists who kidnapped Kate detonate explosives surrounding the Pit, causing a massive cave-in. Grayson discovers Kate, buried alive and with extensive injury to her spine and legs, and tries to help her.<ref>''Batman and Robin'' #8 (February 2010)</ref> Kate is healed after being placed inside the Pit, and she returns to Gotham with the others. Before leaving to return to her home, Grayson flirts with Kate by telling her that he has a thing for red-haired crime-fighters (a reference to his previous love interests, [[Barbara Gordon]] and [[Starfire (Koriand'r)|Starfire]]), apparently unaware of Kate's sexuality.<ref>''Batman and Robin'' #9</ref>\n\nBatwoman also begins hunting down a crazed serial killer known as the Cutter, who has been abducting young women and cutting off parts of their face in order to create the perfect woman. He eventually kidnaps Bette, but Kate tracks the killer to his lair and attacks him. During the fight, Batwoman reveals her identity to Bette when she mentions her tennis career, and in the aftermath Bette is seen in her Flamebird outfit, saying that she wants to be Kate's new partner.<ref>''Detective Comics'' #861\u2013863</ref>\n\n===2010\u20132015: New 52 self-titled series===\n{{Infobox comic book title \n|2ndary_box=y \n|image = Batwoman_01_2011.jpg\n|caption = Promotional art for ''Batwoman'' #1 (September 2011).<br>Art by [[J.

She began to fight crime around the city of Gotham and was constantly pursued by Maggie Sawyer of the GCPD. The two finally came face to face with each other in 1939 and fell in love. Maggie vowed to keep Kate's identity a secret. In 1940, during the time period the allied forces fought overseas, Kate found a new life and happiness with Maggie Sawyer. Together, with her team of Batgirls, the group protects America from criminality.  In 1940s, Kate is \"The Batwoman\" a vigilante inspiring hope in Gotham City. She was named after the bat and baseball uniform she uses to fight crime in. She is recruited by Amanda Waller to enlist in the Bombshells war effort.\n\n==Collected editions==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!#\n! Title !! Material collected \n! Pages!! Date Published !!

'''Katherine \"Kate\" Kane''' is a wealthy heiress who becomes inspired by the superhero [[Batman]] and chooses, like him, to put her wealth and resources towards a campaign to fight crime as a masked vigilante in her home of [[Gotham City]].\n\nThis current version of Batwoman was introduced in 2006 in the seventh week of the publisher's year-long ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' weekly comic book. Introduced as Kate Kane, the modern Batwoman began operating in Gotham City in Batman's absence following the events of the company-wide crossover ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' (2005). The modern Batwoman is written as being of [[Jewish]] descent and as a [[lesbian]]. During the [[New 52]], it is established that Kate Kane is a cousin of Batman's alter-ego Bruce Wayne and thus a niece of his mother [[Martha Wayne]].<ref>''Batwoman'' #25 (November 2013)</ref> Described as the highest-profile gay superhero to appear in stories published by DC, Batwoman's sexual orientation drew wide media attention following her reintroduction, as well as both praise and criticism from the general public.\n\nThe modern character as depicted in comics works relatively independently of Batman, but has gained considerable profile in recent years, both within the DC Comics publishing schedule and the publisher's [[DC Universe|fictional universe]]. She since had several runs in her own eponymous ''Batwoman'' monthly comic book and has had stints in the lead role in ''Detective Comics'', the flagship Batman comic book for which DC Comics is named. The Kate Kane version of Batwoman was later adapted to the animated film ''[[Batman: Bad Blood]]'', voiced by [[Yvonne Strahovski]]. [[Ruby Rose]] portrays the character in her live-action debut during the [[Arrowverse]] crossover \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\", later starring in her own [[Batwoman (TV series)|television series]] and the \"[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths]]\" crossover.\n\n==Publication history==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical \n | header = \n | width = 200\n | image1 = KateKane52week7.jpg\n | caption1 = Kate Kane's debut in ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' #7 (June 2006).

Jones]].\n}}\nThe limited series ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' (2005), written as a sequel to the 1985 maxi-series ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', altered DC Comics continuity. Subsequently, all comic book titles published by DC Comics skip forward [[One Year Later|one year]] and a new maxi-series entitled ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' retroactively chronicles the 52 weeks which directly followed ''Infinite Crisis''. When DC editors called for a redesign of Batwoman, comic book artist [[Alex Ross]] drew inspiration from the modified Batgirl costume he designed for Barbara Gordon, seven years prior to Kate Kane's debut in the limited comic book series ''52''. Ross and comic book author [[Paul Dini]] initially planned to revive the former Batgirl Barbara Gordon using an updated version of the character's original costume, with red accents in place of the traditional yellow. However, since Gordon served as one of a very small number of disabled superheroes of DC Comics as [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]], DC's editorial staff decided to revitalize the original Batwoman instead. In an interview with [[Newsarama]], Ross states, \"They had me change the mask and hair to make it a bit more Batwoman, rather than Batgirl...I pointed out to them that the mask makes her look like the [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]] a little overall\u2014but there weren't many options. The original mask that I had in there when it was to be a Batgirl design was the complete head cover that we've seen, so they did need something different from that.\"<ref name=\"newsarama ross\">{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=Dave |url=http://classic.newsarama.com/dcnew/52/Batwoman/BatwomanRoss.html |title=Alex Ross: Giving Batwoman Her Look |work=[[Newsarama]] |date=June 1, 2006 |accessdate=2007-09-12 }} {{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}</ref>\n\nUnlike the [[Silver Age of Comics|Silver Age]] Kathy Kane, who was romantically attracted to Batman, the new version of Kane is a lesbian,<ref>{{cite web |last=Robinson |first=Bryan |url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=2028464&page=1 |title=Holy Lipstick Lesbian!

After an introductory \"zero\" issue in 2010, the series launched fully in 2011 with ''Batwoman'' #1 along with DC's [[The New 52|company-wide renumbering]] of its titles that year. Writers J.H. Williams III and W. Haden Blackman chose to expand Kate's supporting cast both in terms of her family (the Kanes, including Elizabeth, [[Bette Kane|Bette]] and other relatives), and the \"Batman Family\" she is more loosely connected to. Issue seventeen was also a milestone as it featured Kate proposing to her girlfriend, [[Maggie Sawyer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=44246|website=Comic Book Resources|title=The Bat Signal: Williams focuses on the family in Batwoman|date=13 March 2013|last=Sunu|first=Steve|access-date=2013-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315214636/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=44246|archive-date=2013-03-15|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2013, co-authors J.H.

No ''Origins'' titles have been presented for Kate Kane; her fictional backstory is presented in ''Detective Comics'' through the use of exposition and flashbacks. In their early childhood, Katherine Rebecca \"Kate\" Kane and her sister [[Beth Kane|Elizabeth \"Beth\" Kane]] were identical twins and were very close to each other. On their twelfth birthday, their military father [[Jacob Kane|Jacob \"Jake\" Kane]] could not come home to celebrate with them, so Kate and Beth were taken by their mother, Gabrielle \"Gabi\" Kane, to an expensive restaurant for chocolate and waffles, their favorite dish. On the way to the restaurant, a group of gunmen attacked the family and took them hostage, killing their bodyguard in the process. After learning of her family's kidnapping, Jacob Kane led a rescue mission to save his captured family, which ended with Kate's mother executed and Beth apparently killed after being caught in the crossfire between the kidnappers and soldiers.<ref name=\"DC858\">{{citation | last = Rucka | first = Greg | work = Detective Comics #858 | title = Go 1 | publisher = DC Comics | date = December 2009 | url = http://comicbookdb.com/issue.php?ID=183947 | access-date = 2013-03-16 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110821011128/http://comicbookdb.com/issue.php?ID=183947 | archive-date = 2011-08-21 | url-status = live }}</ref> Years later, Jake marries Catherine Hamilton Kane.\n\nKate is attending the [[United States Military Academy]], where she receives excellent grades, earns prestigious awards, and earns the rank of Brigade Executive Officer in her senior year; she also maintains a secret romantic relationship with her roommate, [[Sophie Moore]]. However, when she is anonymously accused of homosexual conduct, Kate's commanding officer asks her to disavow the allegation on account of her outstanding record, mentioning that if she does, she will be demoted but still be able to graduate. Telling the officer that she refuses to lie and violate the Honor Code of the Academy, Kate admits to being lesbian and is forced to leave the school. When she confronts her father with the news, he supports her and affirms that she upheld her honor and integrity.<ref name=\"DC859\">{{citation | last = Rucka | first = Greg | work = Detective Comics #859 | title = Go 2 | publisher = DC Comics | date = January 2010 | location =  | pages =  | url = http://comicbookdb.com/issue.php?ID=186445 | isbn =  | access-date = 2019-08-25}}</ref>\n\nKate then moves back to Gotham City where she attends college and descends into a wild social lifestyle, consisting of parties, heavy drinking, one-night stands, and tattoos. Kate is eventually pulled over for speeding by a young Renee Montoya, who was just a traffic cop at this point. The two date for several months but break up following a fight where Renee expresses concern about Kate's lack of direction in her life and Kate berates Renee for keeping her sexuality hidden from her colleagues and family. While attempting to call Renee and apologize for her behavior, Kate is attacked by a mugger who wants her wallet and cell phone. Using her military training, Kate easily defeats the criminal just as Batman arrives and helps her off the ground. She is then shown fixated by the Bat Signal as Batman departs the scene.<ref name=\"DC859\"/>\n\nInspired by her encounter with the caped crusader, Kate begins fighting crime using military body armor and weaponry stolen from her father's military base; she operates for close to a year before her father finds out. After being confronted by Jacob, Kate accepts his offer for assistance and begins an intense two years of training across the globe with some of her father's friends from the [[special operations]] community. Upon returning to Gotham, Kate discovers that her father has created a [[Batsuit]] for her, along with an arsenal of experimental weaponry based on Batman's known gadgetry and a bunker hidden in the panic room in Kate's apartment.<ref name=\"DC860\">{{citation | last = Rucka | first = Greg | work = Detective Comics #860 | title = Go 3 | publisher = DC Comics | date = February 2010 | url = http://comicbookdb.com/issue.php?ID=188569 }}</ref>\n\nThe first reference to the modern Batwoman is made by the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]] in ''Detective Comics'' #824 who suggests Batman bring a date to the opening of his club, asking, \"Why don't you bring that new Batwoman?
