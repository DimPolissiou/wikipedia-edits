Born in Chicago in the United States, he represented the [[Republic of Ireland national under-21 football team|Republic of Ireland at under-21 level]].\n\n==Playing career==\nCrawford began his career at schoolboy level with [http://www.terenurerangers.com/ Rangers] <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/terenurerangersfc/|title=Terenure Rangers Football Club|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>before moving to [[Bohemian F.C.|Bohemians]] making his debut against [[Bray Wanderers F.C.|Bray Wanderers]] on 3 November 1991.

While playing for Newcastle, Crawford found his first-team opportunities limited (scoring only once in a pre-season game against Derry City) and was sent out on loan to both [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]] and [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] before signing up for [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] in March 1998, with [[Tommy Burns (footballer)|Tommy Burns]] at the helm. Burns was sacked and he failed to prove himself under the new managership.\n\nCrawford's next destination was [[Shelbourne F.C.|Shelbourne]] back in Ireland whom he helped to four [[League of Ireland]] championships. He signed a new one-year contract on 25 February 2007 with Shels as they got their preparations in place for the new First Division season following the [[Football Association of Ireland|FAI]]'s decision to demote the reigning champions.<ref>[http://www.shelbournefc.com/news.php?id=578 Crawford re-signs for Shels] \u2192 www.shelbournefc.com</ref> He was swiftly appointed captain by new manager, [[Dermot Keely]].<ref>[http://www.shelbournefc.com/news.php?id=585 Keely completes backroom team] \u2192 www.shelbournefc.com</ref> Crawford's last seasons at Shelbourne were hampered by numerous injuries which limited his appearances.
