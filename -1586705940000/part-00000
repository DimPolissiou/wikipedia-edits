Five officers were arrested for Yusuf's murder, which had no noticeable effect on the level of unrest. Opportunities for criminal enterprise flourished. Hundreds of police were dead and more than 60 police stations had been attacked by mid-2012.

The subsequent campaign of violence by Boko Haram culminated in a string of bombings across the country on Christmas Day. In the outskirts of Abuja, 37 died in a church that had its roof blown off. One resident commented, \"Cars were in flames and bodies littered everywhere\", a phrase commonly repeated in international press reports about the bombings.

Media reported the JTF killed 20 to 45 civilians and razed 50 to 100 houses in the neighborhood. The JTF commander in Maiduguri denied the allegations. On November 2, witnesses claimed the JTF shot and killed up to 40 people during raids in Maiduguri. The army claimed it dismissed some officers from the military as a result of alleged abuses committed in Maiduguri, but there were no known formal prosecutions in Maiduguri by year's end.\n\nCredible reports also indicated&nbsp;... uniformed military personnel and [[paramilitary]] [[Nigerian Mobile Police|mobile police]] carried out summary executions, assaults, torture, and other abuses throughout Bauchi, Borno, [[Kano State|Kano]], [[Kaduna State|Kaduna]], [[Plateau State|Plateau]], and Yobe states&nbsp;...

Security forces generally operated with impunity in the illegal apprehension, detention, and sometimes [[Extrajudicial punishment|extrajudicial]] [[execution]] of criminal suspects. The reports of state or federal panels of inquiry investigating [[suspicious death]]s remained unpublished.\n\nThere were no new developments in the case of five police officers accused of executing Muhammad Yusuf in 2009 at a state police headquarters. In July 2011 authorities arraigned five police officers in the federal high court in Abuja for the [[murder]] of Yusuf. The court granted bail to four of the officers, while one remained in custody.\n\nPolice use of excessive force, including use of live ammunition, to disperse demonstrators resulted in numerous killings during the year. For example, although the January fuel subsidy demonstrations generally remained peaceful, security forces reportedly fired on protesters in various states across the country during those demonstrations, resulting in 10 to 15 deaths and an unknown number of wounded.\n\nDespite some improvements resulting from the closure of police checkpoints in many parts of the country, states with an increased security presence due to the activities of Boko Haram experienced a rise in violence and lethal force at police and military [[roadblock]]s.\n\nContinuing abductions of civilians by criminal groups occurred in the Niger Delta and [[Biafra|Southeast]]&nbsp;...

They were linked to a number of kidnappings, often reportedly in association with the splinter group [[Ansaru]], drawing towards them a higher level of international attention.\n\nThe [[Bureau of Counterterrorism|U.S. Bureau of Counterterrorism]] provides the following summary of Boko Haram's 2013 foreign operations:\n{{quote|In February 2013, Boko Haram was responsible for kidnapping seven French tourists in the far north of Cameroon.

In October, the government announced the girls' imminent release, but the information proved unreliable. The announcement to the media of a peace agreement and the imminent release of all the missing girls was followed days later by a video message in which Shekau stated that no such meeting had taken place and that the girls had been \"married off\". The announcement to the media, unaccompanied by any evidence of the reality of the agreement, was thought by analysts to have been a political ploy by the president to raise his popularity before his confirmation of his candidacy in the [[2015 Nigerian general election|2015 general election]].

However it angered citizens in the region (owing to negative social and economic consequences of the mobile shutdown) and engendered negative opinions toward the state and new emergency policies. While citizens and organizations developed various coping and circumventing strategies, Boko Haram evolved from an open network model of insurgency to a closed centralized system, shifting the center of its operations to the [[Sambisa Forest]].

The most successful of these was the attack on the army barracks in Bauchi. A spokesman for the group told BBC Hausa that the attack had been carried out, as a test of loyalty, by serving members of the military hoping to join the group. This charge was later refuted by an army spokesman who claimed: \"This is not a [[banana republic]]\". However, on 8 January 2012 the president would announce that Boko Haram had in reality infiltrated both the army and the police, as well as the executive, parliamentary and legislative branches of government. Boko Haram's spokesman also claimed responsibility for the killing outside his home in Maiduguri of the politician Abba Anas Ibn Umar Garbai, the younger brother of the Shehu of Borno, who was the second most prominent Muslim in the country after the [[Sultan of Sokoto]]. He added: \"We are doing what we are doing to fight injustice, if they stop their satanic ways of doing things and the injustices, we would stop what we are doing\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2011/06/boko-haram-claims-responsibility-for-bomb-blasts-in-bauchi-maiduguri/ |title=Boko Haram claims responsibility for bomb blasts in Bauchi, Maiduguri |work=Vanguard News |date=1 June 2011 |accessdate=31 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.punchng.com/news/boko-haram-has-infiltrated-my-govt-jonathan/ |title=Boko Haram has infiltrated my govt \u2013Jonathan |work=Punch |author=Olalekan Adetayo |date=9 January 2012 |accessdate=6 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808043607/http://www.punchng.com/news/boko-haram-has-infiltrated-my-govt-jonathan/ |archivedate=8 August 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nThis was one of several political and religious assassinations Boko Haram carried out that year, with the presumed intention of correcting injustices in the group's home state of Borno. Meanwhile, the trail of massacres continued relentlessly, apparently leading the country towards civil war. By the end of 2011, these conflicting strategies led observers to question the group's cohesion; comparisons were drawn with the diverse motivations of the militant factions of the oil-rich [[Niger Delta]].

In July 2011 authorities arraigned five police officers in the federal high court in Abuja for the [[murder]] of Yusuf. The court granted bail to four of the officers, while one remained in custody.\n\nPolice use of excessive force, including use of live ammunition, to disperse demonstrators resulted in numerous killings during the year. For example, although the January fuel subsidy demonstrations generally remained peaceful, security forces reportedly fired on protesters in various states across the country during those demonstrations, resulting in 10 to 15 deaths and an unknown number of wounded.\n\nDespite some improvements resulting from the closure of police checkpoints in many parts of the country, states with an increased security presence due to the activities of Boko Haram experienced a rise in violence and lethal force at police and military [[roadblock]]s.\n\nContinuing abductions of civilians by criminal groups occurred in the Niger Delta and [[Biafra|Southeast]]&nbsp;... Police and other security forces were often implicated in the kidnapping schemes.\n\nAlthough the constitution and law prohibit such practices and provide for punishment of such abuses, torture is not criminalized, and security service personnel, including police, military, and State Security Service (SSS) officers, regularly tortured, beat, and abused demonstrators, criminal suspects, detainees, and convicted prisoners. Police [[mistreatment|mistreated]] civilians to extort money.

The conflict and refugees spilled over the national borders to involve all four countries.\n\nIn 2013, Boko Haram increased operations in Northern Cameroon, and were involved in skirmishes along the borders of [[Chad]] and Niger. They were linked to a number of kidnappings, often reportedly in association with the splinter group [[Ansaru]], drawing towards them a higher level of international attention.\n\nThe [[Bureau of Counterterrorism|U.S. Bureau of Counterterrorism]] provides the following summary of Boko Haram's 2013 foreign operations:\n{{quote|In February 2013, Boko Haram was responsible for kidnapping seven French tourists in the far north of Cameroon.

Nigeria, Chad and Niger had formed a Multinational Joint Task Force in 1998. In February 2012, Cameroon signed an agreement with Nigeria to establish a Joint Trans-Border Security Committee, which was inaugurated in November 2013, when Cameroon announced plans to conduct \"coordinated but separate\" border patrols in 2014.

Earlier in the year, the girls' plight had featured on \"#BringBackOurGirls\" political campaign posters in the streets of the capital, which the president denied knowledge of and soon took down after news of criticism surfaced.

sharing raw intelligence data, and the Nigerian military had failed to supply information that might have aided U.S. drone flights in locating the kidnapped girls. The Nigerian government claims that Boko Haram is \"the West Africa branch of the world-wide Al-Qaida movement\" with connections to [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]] in [[Somalia]] and AQIM in Mali. The Nigerian government denies having committed human rights abuses in the conflict, and therefore oppose U.S. restrictions on arms sales, which they see as being based on the U.S. mis-application of the [[Leahy Law]] due to concerns over [[human rights in Nigeria]]. The U.S. had supplied the Nigerian army with trucks and equipment but had blocked the sale of [[Cobra helicopter]]s. In November 2014 the U.S. State department again refused to supply Cobras, citing concerns over the Nigerian military's ability to maintain and use them without endangering civilians.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nigeriaembassyusa.org/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&cntnt01articleid=357&cntnt01origid=15&cntnt01detailtemplate=nigeriadet&cntnt01returnid=108 |title=A Stable and Secure Nigeria: An Asset to America |publisher=Embassy of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Washington, D.C. |date=11 November 2014 |accessdate=12 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-30006066 |title=Boko Haram crisis: Nigeria fury over U.S. arms refusal |work=BBC News|date=11 November 2014 |accessdate=12 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/01/world/with-schoolgirls-still-missing-fragile-us-nigeria-ties-falter.html |title=With Schoolgirls Taken by Boko Haram Still Missing, U.S.-Nigeria Ties Falter |newspaper=The New York Times |author=Eric Schmidt |date=31 December 2014 |accessdate=1 January 2015}}</ref><ref name=cobra/>\n\nOn 1 December 2014, the U.S. embassy in Abuja announced that the U.S. had discontinued training a Nigerian battalion at the request of the Nigerian government.

It took place between 10 August and 5 September 1643, between the defending Parliamentarian garrison of [[Gloucester]] and the besieging army of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. The siege ended with the arrival of a relieving Parliamentarian army under the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]]. The Royalist forces withdrew, having sustained heavy casualties and had several cannons disabled as a result of sallies made by the defenders.\n\n==Prelude==\nFollowing the Royalist defeat at the [[Battle of Edgehill]] in October 1642, King Charles I's control of the south was limited to [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]] and the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]], and a pocket of the [[Thames Valley]] around [[Oxford]], where he based his wartime capital.<ref>Day 2007 p. 29</ref> The ruling [[Puritans|Puritan]] elite of [[Gloucester]] ensured the city of some 5,000 inhabitants would be from the outset a staunchly Parliamentarian stronghold in the struggle against an anti-Puritan King and his [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Queen.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 59\u201360</ref> Possession of Gloucester, along with [[Bristol]] to the south, threatened both Oxford and access to the Royalist recruiting grounds of Wales.<ref>Day 2007 p. 21</ref>\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt to rally Royalist support in [[Cirencester]] in August 1642 prompted Parliamentarians in [[Gloucestershire]] to muster the [[Militia (English)|militia]], and in November the first regular troops were garrisoned in Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 p. 60</ref> In February 1643 the Royalist commander [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] easily defeated a militia garrison at Cirencester, prompting the Parliamentarians to recall their outposts at [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]], [[Sudeley Castle|Sudeley]] and [[Tewkesbury]]. The next day Rupert appeared before Gloucester, but lacked the strength to enforce his demand for the city's surrender. Later that month an army of 2,000 Welshman led by [[Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort|Lord Herbert of Raglan]] arrived on the west bank of the Severn opposite the city, but lacked the strength for an assault across the river. Its presence caused great consternation in Gloucester until a Parliamentarian army commanded by Sir [[William Waller]] defeated it on 24 March.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 60\u201362</ref>\n\nThe defeat of Waller in the [[Battle of Roundway Down]] on 13 July by the Royalist Western Army left both Bristol and Gloucester vulnerable, and on 18 July Rupert led another Royalist army out of Oxford to take control of the Severn valley. On 26 July Rupert's Oxford Army, supported by the Western Army, seized Bristol. Royalist casualties were high, and despite Rupert's instructions to the contrary, the victorious troops plundered the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 21\u201325</ref> Rupert was appointed governor of Bristol, but infighting within the Royalist leadership and concerns that an attack on Gloucester would result in the same high casualties prompted [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to travel to Bristol for a council of war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 26\u201328</ref> He arrived on 2 August, and over the next five days consulted with his advisers on the best course of action. The strategic situation since Edgehill had improved significantly for the Royalists, with victories in the north of England, the arrival of reinforcements and materiel in June, and an opposition that had fallen into disarray.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 29\u201331</ref> Rupert's plan to consolidate the Royalist grip on the west by seizing Gloucester faced opposition from those in the King's camp, led by his wife Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], who believed a march on London could end the war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 51\u201353</ref>\n\nThe capture of Gloucester would give Charles some advantages. It would allow the Royalist garrisons farther up the Severn at [[Worcester]] and [[Shrewsbury]] to be supplied from Bristol, with consequent benefit to the economy of that city. Gloucestershire \u2013 populous, wealthy and Parliamentarian \u2013 could be punitively taxed, and Welsh manpower and money could be freely deployed against the King's enemies in the rest of the country. Although it was likely that Rupert would have been able to storm a city that was less well defended than Bristol, Charles was not willing to risk the casualties an assault would incur.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 54\u201355</ref> On 6 August the Parliamentarian governor of Gloucester, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward Massey]], refused to surrender the city, but in a secret communication he let it be known that he would do so if the King, rather than Rupert, led the army on Gloucester. Charles decided the next day that this was the best chance of securing Gloucester quickly and without bloodshed. This compromise plan pleased neither the Queen's faction, who saw it as an unnecessary diversion from the more decisive objective of London, nor Rupert, who remained in Bristol in the belief that the Royalist army was not strong enough to allow Massey to honourably surrender without a fight.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 55\u201357</ref>\n\n==Gloucester defences==\n[[File:SoG 1.jpg|thumb|upright=2|City defences during the siege in 1643]]\nGloucester's strength lay in its location. To the west, the River Severn formed a natural defence against an assaulting army. To the north and north-east the marshy ground was unsuitable for siege operations, and the River Twyver and a tributary stream added to the obstacles. This left the higher and drier ground to the east and south as the only feasible directions for an attack. In the preceding centuries the city had grown beyond its medieval defences, of which only the ruined [[Gloucester Castle|castle]] by the river and a stretch of wall that linked the south, east and original north fates, the last known as the inner north gate and now well within the city, still survived. From the south gate to the east gate the wall was high but not thick enough to withstand 17th-century artillery or mining operations.<ref name=Day65\u201366>Day 2007 pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nThe fall of Bristol prompted the hurried reinforcement of the existing defences. New earthworks and a narrow water-filled ditch completed the line of fortifications from the south gate to the Severn. Another earthwork was extended north from Whitefriars Barn on the north-east corner of the medieval wall to the outer north gate. From there the River Twyver formed a moat as the earthwork followed it north-west to Alvin Gate then on to the river's junction with the Old Severn.<ref name=Day65\u201366 /> This easternmost channel of the River Severn had dried up by the 19th century, but at the time of the civil war it was still a navigable river.<ref>Herbert 1988 para. 2</ref><ref>Rhodes 2006 p. 14</ref> The earthwork then followed the Old Severn south-west to a point a short distance north of Westgate Street, from where it was extended the other side of the Old Severn to the River Severn just above the west gate.<ref name=Day66>Day 2007 p. 66</ref> Inside the city, an earthwork was extended west from the end of the medieval wall at the inner north gate via [[Gloucester Cathedral]] to [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester|St Oswald's Priory]], where it met the new outer earthwork.<ref name=Day66 /> The outer north gate and Alvin Gate were fortified with earthwork [[bastion]]s,<ref name=Day66 /> a drawbridge was installed at Westgate Bridge and the Old Severn was dammed at Dockham, causing the ground to north-west of the city to flood.<ref>Rhodes 2006 pp. 17, 29\u201330</ref>\n\nThe garrison numbered no more than 1,500 troops. The bulk of these comprised two half-strength regiments each of some 600 men: the [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford|Earl of Stamford]]'s Regiment of Foot, recruited from London and Leicestershire, and a locally recruited regiment known as the Town Regiment. The remainder comprised a company of [[Trained bands|trained band]], 100 [[dragoon]]s and a [[troop]] of cavalry. The city's dozen or so artillery pieces ranged in size from light cannon to two nine-pounder [[demi-culverin]]s. Stamford's regiment was experienced and well led, though of uncertain discipline. The Town Regiment lacked experience but was motivated by its ties to the city it was defending, although there is evidence that some of its men would refuse to oppose the King. The city could support itself with basic necessities, but it lacked sufficient gunpowder to withstand an assault or prolonged siege.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 63\u201365</ref>\n\nMassey was an autocratic military commander, but his authority in the city was shared with the civilian administration. A committee had been established in December 1642 to manage the Parliamentarian war effort in the county, but [[Thomas Pury]], the [[member of parliament]] for Gloucester, was the only committee member in the city. Civic authority was held by a forty-member council, though in practice an inner core of some fifteen [[Alderman|aldermen]], including the mayor, wielded power. As many of these were, like Pury, officers in the city's garrison, political and military command was largely integrated.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 66\u201367</ref> In the days immediately following the fall of Bristol, morale in the city, both military and civilian, was low.<ref>Day 2007 p. 68</ref> It's possible that this was what prompted Massey consider surrendering the city, though his message suggesting he would may have been a subterfuge designed to buy some time.<ref>Day 2007 p. 73</ref> There is strong evidence that the conduct and actions of the city elite, including Massey and particularly Pury, did much to stiffen the city's resolve. Officers and councillors with Royalist sympathies were given the opportunity to leave, and those who remained were required to restate an oath of allegiance to Parliament. The discipline of the troops was improved by paying them, and civilians were kept busy reinforcing the city's defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\n==Siege==\nAs Charles marched north from Bristol, reinforcements were converging on Gloucester from Oxford, Worcester and Herefordshire.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 86\u201387</ref> By the afternoon of 10 August the Royalist army, comprising some 6,000 infantry and 2,500 mounted troops, began assembling around the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 90\u201391</ref> Charles set up his headquarters at [[Matson, Gloucester|Matson]] House.<ref>Day 2007 p. 97</ref> His demand for Gloucester's surrender was unanimously and somewhat insolently rejected, and the Parliamentarians set fire to the suburbs outside the city defences to clear lines of fire and deprive the Royalists of cover.<ref>Day 2007 pp. , 91\u201393,96</ref> Charles had decided to march on Gloucester in the belief that the city would be quickly surrendered. Now that gambit had failed, he decided to besiege it. His pride had been wounded by the manner of the Parliamentarian rejection. His commanders, assessing the state of the city's defences, supplies and morale, persuaded him the city could be taken within ten days without an assault. Intelligence indicated the even if the Parliamentarians were able to send a relieving force, it could be easily defeated before it could reach the city. Most decisively, the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]], whose support was necessary in any campaign against London, declared himself unable to march south while Hull remained in Parliamentarian hands, leaving Charles too weak to contemplate such a move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 93\u201395</ref>\n\n===First ten days===\n\n[[File:SoG 2.jpg|thumb|upright=2|Royalist dispositions during the siege]]\nThe first shots were fired in the afternoon as Sir [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Jacob Astley]] established his forces near Issold's House on the eastern side of the city. [[Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Forth|Lord Forth]], who had been given overall command of the siege, set up a fortified leaguer to the rear of the ruined [[Llanthony Secunda Priory]] and established his forces to the south of the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 95\u201396, 99, 100\u2013101</ref> By dawn on 11 August, a line of trenches had been dug some {{convert|130|yd|m}} from the walls, placing the two sides within musket range of each other, stretching from [[Brunswick Square, Gloucester|Gaudy Green]] on the south side to Issold's House on the east.<ref>Day 2007 p. 99</ref> Massey responded with spoiling tactics in an attempt to hinder Royalist siege operations and delay the assault he was expecting. At midnight a small raiding party succeeded in disrupting Royalist entrenching operations on Gaudy Green, and a larger raid on the green the next morning, 12 August, resulted in the capture of Royalist men, tools and weapons.<ref>Day 2007 p. 100</ref> By this time, the reinforcements from Herefordshire and Worcester under the command of Sir William Vavasour arrived on the west bank of the Severn and began crossing the river to take up positions at Kingsholm, to the north of the city. This force increased the size of the besieging army by another 2,400 infantry and over 300 cavalry. They too were the target of a Parliamentarian raid which inflicted up to fifteen casualties on the Royalists.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 100</ref>\n\nLater on 12 August, Forth completed an earthwork square on Gaudy Green, in which he placed two 24-pounders, the largest of the Royalist's eight cannon, along with a 12-pounder to target the south wall. Another artillery emplacement was positioned to target the east wall nearby.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 99\u2013102</ref> With the artillery in place, the Royalists began bombarding the walls, with the main effort beginning at 11:00 on 13 August. The cannon were too light to have any significant impact, and of the two mortars the Royalists possessed, one, reputed to be the largest in the country, exploded on its first use. When it became evident the Royalists were focusing their efforts on the south-east corner of the city defences, Massey quickly buttressed the medieval walls with up to {{convert|5|ft|m}} of earth, which ensured that the defences held. Meanwhile, the majority of Vavasour's troops completed their crossing of the Severn, leaving behind a small contingent to blockade the west bank.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 100\u2013102</ref>\n\nReacting to rumours that Vavasour had received a reinforcement of artillery, the Parliamentarians mounted another raid to the north of the city on 14 August. They captured two prisoners but failed in their primary objective of locating and spiking any guns.<ref>Day 2007 p. 102</ref> The Royalist bombardment continued through 14 August, but a breach blown in the wall by the larger guns on Gaudy Green was quickly plugged by the defenders with woolsacks and [[gabion]]s. Royalist engineers mining towards the walls from trenches at the green succeeded in draining the ditch below the walls, but this was not followed up with an assault. By the end of the day the Royalist guns had fallen silent; the evidence suggests they had run out of ammunition.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 102\u2013103</ref>\n\nThe following day Vavasour received a reinforcement of 500 [[Glamorgan]] militia and 450 musketeers from Bristol, while the Parliamentarians bolstered the earthwork defences around the south and north gates. On 16 August Rupert accompanied Charles to Oxford, and neither were at Gloucester to witness the most ambitious Parliamentarian raid yet. Just before sunset, 150 musketeers of Stamford's regiment sallied out of the north gate to attack the Royalist trenches east of the city. The Parliamentarians claimed 100 Royalist killed for the cost of 2 injured, while Royalist sources report 24 Parliamentarians killed and more wounded, for the loss of 4 Royalists killed.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 103\u2013105</ref>\n\nStruggling with a shortage of gunpowder and with the guns quiet, the Royalists concentrated on mining operations to breach the city walls. Miners recruited from the [[Forest of Dean]] were set to work under a protective gallery to fill the {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} deep by {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} wide moat which, when completed, would allow them to undermine the walls. It was slow work, estimated to need a week to complete. The faster alternative was to forgo the protection and fill the moat with [[fascine]]s. An attempt to do this was beaten back by musket fire from the walls, and resulted in the desertion of the miners.<ref>Day 2007 103, 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy 18 August Vavasour had deployed three cannon in front of his main camp at Kingsholm and another opposite Alvin Gate. These were the targets of a Parliamentarian raid that morning that was even larger than previous efforts; a diversionary attack by 50 men and a main force of 400. All four of Vavasour's cannon were disabled, the Parliamentarians claiming over 100 Royalist casualties for the loss of 6, the Royalists admitting 28 casualties and claiming to have killed 27 Parliamentarians. Another Parliamentarian raid the same day involved their only recorded use of cavalry during the siege, when 150 musketeers and 40 cavalry mounted an ineffectual attack on Royalist positions to the east of the city. Charles, meanwhile, was on his way back to Gloucester with another 1,000 reinforcements.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy the morning of 19 August, two 6-pounder cannon had been installed in a third emplacement opposite the east gate, bringing all the original artillery online. At 10:00, the bombardment was resumed in a last effort to subdue the city by the original ten-day deadline. Constrained by the limited supplies of ammunition and gunpowder, the bombardment had little material effect, though it prompted Massey to hastily erect a breastwork in the open ground of Friar's Orchard, at the south east corner of the city where the Royalist artillery was being concentrated. A Royalist attempt to cross the moat after dark was beaten back by musket fire. The objective of forcing the surrender of Gloucester by siege in ten days had failed, partly due to the city's resolve and Massey's spoiling attacks, but mainly due to the inadequacy of the Royalist artillery.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 107\u2013109</ref>\n\n===Shift of focus to mining===\n\nThe Parliamentarians mounted another raid at dawn on 21 August. It was a two-pronged attack designed to disable the Royalist artillery south and east of the walls. One detachment travelled by boat down the Severn, landed between Forth's camp and a redoubt opposite the castle and successfuly stormed the redoubt. The second detachment of 200 musketeers sallied from the north gate. Intending first to attack the battery opposite the east gate, this force became lost and blundered into Royalist infantry camps. When Massey saw that the raid was not going to plan, he sounded the recall. The Parliamentarians suffered eight casualties, the Royalists more than twenty. Such raids were proving risky and wasteful of the garrison's limited ammunition, and this was the last large-scale operation mounted by the Parliamentarians.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 112\u2013113</ref>\n\nAs the Royalists set about replenishing their stocks of ammunition, they intensified their mining efforts. It was anticipated that the original effort to bridge the moat would allow the besiegers to reach the east wall on 24 August. A second effort to bridge the moat to the south was begun, as was a more complicated project to tunnel towards the east gate. Royalist agents attempted to persuade the garrison to surrender, and Royalist cavalry staged a mock battle in an unsuccessful attempt to lure the garrison out of the city in the belief that a relief force had arrived.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 114\u2013115</ref> A desultory bombardment was maintained, particularly by the mortars, until 25 August, when it was intensified. An attempt that day by Massey to disrupt it with a sally from the north gate was beaten back by cavalry, but as before, a shortage of ammunition \u2013 at one stage the Royalists resorted to firing stones \u2013 blunted the impact, and little damage was done to the city.<ref>Day 2007 p. 116</ref>\n\nFollowing news that the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] was raising a Parliamentarian army in London, Charles and Rupert travelled to Oxford on 26 August, where they held a two-day council of war. With no intelligence of Essex's plans, the Royalists bolstered the defences of Oxford with troops earmarked for the siege of Gloucester while the Royalist garrison at Bristol was urged to send all the forces it could spare to Gloucester. Believing that Essex could muster no more than 6,000 troops, the decision was made to continue the siege, though contingency plans for the blockade of Gloucester were drawn up in case it had to be lifted. [[Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester|Lord Wilmot]] was instructed to muster 2,000 cavalry around [[Banbury]]. Their task would be to delay the Parliamentarians in the [[Cotswolds]] until Rupert could come up with the rest of the Royalist cavalry in support, should Essex march to the relief of Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 117\u2013118</ref>\n\nEssex began his march from [[Colnbrook]], west of London, on 26 August.<ref>Day 2007 p. 127</ref> His plan was to relieve Gloucester without provoking a major battle in which, with the Royalist superiority in cavalry, he would be at a disdvantage. His route was dictated by the desire to minimise the amount of open country favourable to cavalry operations he would have to pass through, and took him north of Oxford via Aylesbury and Bicester and then across the Cotswolds.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 124\u2013126</ref> At the beginning of September Essex was due north of Oxford with an army of some 10,500 infantry, no more than 4,500 mounted troops and an artillery train that is estimated at no more than 50 guns.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 130\u2013131, 133</ref>\n\nMining was now the principal tactic by which the Royalists hoped to bring the siege to a successful conclusion. Priority was given to tunnelling at the east gate, which caused progress on efforts to fill the moat below the south and east walls to slow, possibly as a result of a lack of miners and engineers. Parliamentarian countermining at the east gate on 28 August was quickly abandoned because of springs that caused flooding, which accounts for the slow pace of the Royalist efforts there.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 136\u2013138</ref> Massey continued to harass the besiegers with sniping and artillery fire, and he resumed countermining operations at the east gate after a reconnaissance party had reported Royalists miners were still working on their mine. The progress of the Royalist mines closer towards the walls, quickened by the arrival of Welsh miners on 29 August, led Massey to believe an assault was imminent. On 1 September he fortified Friars Orchard with an earthwork wall and [[Sconce (fortification)|sconce]], a fort in which he placed four pieces of artillery that could be brought to bear on any Royalists who broke through the south-east corner or the east gate.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 138\u2013140</ref>\n\nOn 3 September the Parliamentarians placed a [[Saker (cannon)|saker]] in a gun port they had been secretly building in east wall above the gallery protecting the Royalist miners. The medium-sized cannon was employed most of the day against the gallery, to little effect, until the Royalists targeted it with a cannon of their own, at which point it was withdrawn. The Royalists anticipated their mine would reach the east gate the next day, while they believed Essex could be delayed in the Cotswolds for four days. The Bristol garrison was being stripped for reinforcements and orders had been sent to Oxford for ten field guns and the equipment necessary to make the guns already at Gloucester mobile, should it become necessary to redeploy them from siegework to use in open battle.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 140\u2013141</ref>\n\n===Approach of the relief army===\n\nBy the end of 3 September Essex's lead element, the London brigade, was at [[Oddington, Gloucestershire|Oddington]], {{convert|2|mi|km}} east of [[Stow-on-the-Wold]]. The Parliamentarian army was largely untroubled by Wilmot's Royalist cavalry, and because of the differing rates of march it was strung out as far back as [[Chipping Norton]], nearly {{convert|6|mi|km}} to the east. Meanwhile Rupert had led the rest of the Royalist cavalry from Gloucester and, having rendezvoused with Wilmot, ended the day with some 5,000 men camped around [[Bourton-on-the-Water]], {{convert|4|mi|km}} south-west of Stow.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 141\u2013143, 146</ref> The next day the two forces clashed. Although Rupert enjoyed superior numbers, he was dissuaded from pressing his advantage by the appearance of [[Edmund Harvey]] with a regiment of Parliamentarian cavalry and two of infantry. When Essex arrived with the rest of the Parliamentarian army, Rupert was forced into a steady retreat to the area of [[Andoversford]] and [[Compton Abdale]], while Essex's army ended the day around [[Naunton]]. Rupert had been surprised by the size of Essex's force and the skill with which it was handled, and had completely failed in his mission to delay it.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 144\u2013147, 148</ref>\n\nIn Gloucester the Parliamentarians could see the evacuation of some 400 sick or wounded Royalists and the dispatch of some artillery away from the siege, but also the arrival of 2,000 infantry and 500 mounted reinforcements from Bristol. The defender's countermine reached outside the east gate, where they discovered and began boring down on the deeper Royalist mine, while inside the gate an earthwork was completed across the road and the buildings either side were turned into [[blockhouse]]s. They were critically low on gunpowder, but buoyed by the sight of fires lit on nearby Wainlode Hill signalling the approach of Essex. The Royalists, meanwhile, were readying the heavy guns to move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 147\u2013148</ref>\n\nOn 5 September Essex took the quickest way off the open country of the Cotswold hills down into the relative safety of the Severn valley. This meant descending the steep escarpment at Prestbury Hill towards [[Cheltenham]], rather than heading directly to Gloucester. His lead elements began the difficult descent at dusk, but the baggage train and rearguard were forced to spend the night in worsening weather in the hills. Rupert, who appears to have expected a more direct march on Gloucester, could do little to harass the Parliamentarians, and returned to Gloucester. There he covered the Royalist army as it lifted the siege and withdrew to Matson, {{convert|2|mi|km}} south-east of the city. Charles had already departed his headquarters there and ridden ahead to [[Painswick]]. The defenders inside the city did not know how close Essex was and, not quite believing the siege was over, did not harry the retreating Royalists but remained vigilant behind their defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 148\u2013151</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nRoyalist casualties during the siege were claimed to be in the range of 1,000 to over 1,500, the Parliamentarian losses ranging from 30 to 50. Royalist sources concede 120 killed during the siege, with reports of sick and wounded giving numbers of 900, 400 and 300. [[Jon Day]] gives a conservative estimate of Royalist casualties as 1,200 killed, wounded and sick, with another 800 lost to desertion.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 155, 168</ref> The siege had come close to succeeding, and by the end of it the defenders were down to their last barrels of gunpowder. It is unlikely they would have been able to withstand an assault, but because of Charles's aversion to casualties, none was ever attempted. Massey's aggressive tactics were a critical factor in the successful defence of the city, and ensured that morale never dropped to the low levels witnessed before the siege began. The Royalists specifically identified his countermining as the reason for lifting the siege. The Royalist artillery proved inadequate to the task of siege work, and the 300\u2013400 large cannon balls and 20+ mortar bombs that were fired on the city failed to blow any major breach in the walls, start any significant fires or cause more than a handful of casualties.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 154\u2013155</ref>\n\nAlthough the failure at Gloucester adversely affected Royalist morale, the campaign presented Charles with an opportunity to inflict a decisive blow against his enemy. The Parliamentarian army and its trained band reserves had effectively been lured out of a strong position behind the London defences, into open country where they could be more easily defeated. Against a Parliamentarian army some 14,500 strong, the Royalist army of 9,000 infantry and 6,000 cavalry was slightly inferior in the quantity of infantry but superior in cavalry by a factor of three to two. The arrival of additional guns ordered from Oxford during the siege gave the Royalists parity in artillery.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 165, 167\u2013168</ref>\n\nEssex's objective after the siege was to evade the Royalist army and return his own intact to London. In a feint designed to draw Charles away from his intended route back to London, Essex marched north to [[Tewkesbury]], where he could better supply his army and threaten Royalist Worcester.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 171\u2013172</ref> When Charles marched his army after him, Essex retraced his steps back to Cheltenham. With the Royalists concentrated around [[Evesham]] and [[Pershore]], he struck out back across the Cotswolds in the direction of Cirencester, where he defeated the 400-strong Royalist garrison on 16 September.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 175, 177\u2013178</ref>\n\nEssex believed he had etablished a commanding lead over Charles and, not wishing to drive his hungry army too hard, slowed his pace on the march to [[Swindon]].<ref>Day 2007 pp. 184\u2013185</ref> He was further slowed after Swindon when Rupert's cavalry caught up, and the resulting [[Battle of Aldbourne Chase]] on 18 September allowed the rest of the Royalist army to close the distance.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 186\u2013192</ref> Charles finally brought Essex to battle on 20 September in the [[First Battle of Newbury]], but failed to defeat him, allowing the Parliamentarians to reach the safety of their London stronghold four days later.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 226, 269, 280</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nProfessor [[David Daube]] suggested in ''[[The Oxford Magazine]]'' of 16 February 1956 that the nursery rhyme [[Humpty Dumpty]] originated from a [[siege engine]] used at Gloucester, based on a contemporary account of the attack, but without evidence that the rhyme was connected.<ref>Daube 2009 pp. 365\u2013366.</ref> The theory was part of an anonymous series of articles on the origin of nursery rhymes and was widely acclaimed in academia,<ref>Rodger 1999</ref> but it was derided by others as \"ingenuity for ingenuity's sake\" and declared to be a spoof.<ref>Opie 1997 p. 254</ref><ref>Opie 2004 p. 76.</ref>\n\nFor centuries afterwards, the lifting of the siege was marked by an annual [[Gloucester Day]]. This died out in the nineteenth century but was reinstated in 2009.<ref name=bbc>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/gloucestershire/8239588.stm Tradition revived for city pride.] BBC News, 5 September 2009.

It took place between 10 August and 5 September 1643, between the defending Parliamentarian garrison of [[Gloucester]] and the besieging army of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. The siege ended with the arrival of a relieving Parliamentarian army under the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]]. The Royalist forces withdrew, having sustained heavy casualties and had several cannons disabled as a result of sallies made by the defenders.\n\n==Prelude==\nFollowing the Royalist defeat at the [[Battle of Edgehill]] in October 1642, King Charles I's control of the south was limited to [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]] and the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]], and a pocket of the [[Thames Valley]] around [[Oxford]], where he based his wartime capital.<ref>Day 2007 p. 29</ref> The ruling [[Puritans|Puritan]] elite of [[Gloucester]] ensured the city of some 5,000 inhabitants would be from the outset a staunchly Parliamentarian stronghold in the struggle against an anti-Puritan King and his [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Queen.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 59\u201360</ref> Possession of Gloucester, along with [[Bristol]] to the south, threatened both Oxford and access to the Royalist recruiting grounds of Wales.<ref>Day 2007 p. 21</ref>\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt to rally Royalist support in [[Cirencester]] in August 1642 prompted Parliamentarians in [[Gloucestershire]] to muster the [[Militia (English)|militia]], and in November the first regular troops were garrisoned in Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 p. 60</ref> In February 1643 the Royalist commander [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] easily defeated a militia garrison at Cirencester, prompting the Parliamentarians to recall their outposts at [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]], [[Sudeley Castle|Sudeley]] and [[Tewkesbury]]. The next day Rupert appeared before Gloucester, but lacked the strength to enforce his demand for the city's surrender. Later that month an army of 2,000 Welshman led by [[Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort|Lord Herbert of Raglan]] arrived on the west bank of the Severn opposite the city, but lacked the strength for an assault across the river. Its presence caused great consternation in Gloucester until a Parliamentarian army commanded by Sir [[William Waller]] defeated it on 24 March.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 60\u201362</ref>\n\nThe defeat of Waller in the [[Battle of Roundway Down]] on 13 July by the Royalist Western Army left both Bristol and Gloucester vulnerable, and on 18 July Rupert led another Royalist army out of Oxford to take control of the Severn valley. On 26 July Rupert's Oxford Army, supported by the Western Army, seized Bristol. Royalist casualties were high, and despite Rupert's instructions to the contrary, the victorious troops plundered the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 21\u201325</ref> Rupert was appointed governor of Bristol, but infighting within the Royalist leadership and concerns that an attack on Gloucester would result in the same high casualties prompted [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to travel to Bristol for a council of war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 26\u201328</ref> He arrived on 2 August, and over the next five days consulted with his advisers on the best course of action. The strategic situation since Edgehill had improved significantly for the Royalists, with victories in the north of England, the arrival of reinforcements and materiel in June, and an opposition that had fallen into disarray.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 29\u201331</ref> Rupert's plan to consolidate the Royalist grip on the west by seizing Gloucester faced opposition from those in the King's camp, led by his wife Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], who believed a march on London could end the war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 51\u201353</ref>\n\nThe capture of Gloucester would give Charles some advantages. It would allow the Royalist garrisons farther up the Severn at [[Worcester]] and [[Shrewsbury]] to be supplied from Bristol, with consequent benefit to the economy of that city. Gloucestershire \u2013 populous, wealthy and Parliamentarian \u2013 could be punitively taxed, and Welsh manpower and money could be freely deployed against the King's enemies in the rest of the country. Although it was likely that Rupert would have been able to storm a city that was less well defended than Bristol, Charles was not willing to risk the casualties an assault would incur.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 54\u201355</ref> On 6 August the Parliamentarian governor of Gloucester, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward Massey]], refused to surrender the city, but in a secret communication he let it be known that he would do so if the King, rather than Rupert, led the army on Gloucester. Charles decided the next day that this was the best chance of securing Gloucester quickly and without bloodshed. This compromise plan pleased neither the Queen's faction, who saw it as an unnecessary diversion from the more decisive objective of London, nor Rupert, who remained in Bristol in the belief that the Royalist army was not strong enough to allow Massey to honourably surrender without a fight.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 55\u201357</ref>\n\n==Gloucester defences==\n[[File:SoG 1.jpg|thumb|upright=2|City defences during the siege in 1643]]\nGloucester's strength lay in its location. To the west, the River Severn formed a natural defence against an assaulting army. To the north and north-east the marshy ground was unsuitable for siege operations, and the River Twyver and a tributary stream added to the obstacles. This left the higher and drier ground to the east and south as the only feasible directions for an attack. In the preceding centuries the city had grown beyond its medieval defences, of which only the ruined [[Gloucester Castle|castle]] by the river and a stretch of wall that linked the south, east and original north fates, the last known as the inner north gate and now well within the city, still survived. From the south gate to the east gate the wall was high but not thick enough to withstand 17th-century artillery or mining operations.<ref name=Day65\u201366>Day 2007 pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nThe fall of Bristol prompted the hurried reinforcement of the existing defences. New earthworks and a narrow water-filled ditch completed the line of fortifications from the south gate to the Severn. Another earthwork was extended north from Whitefriars Barn on the north-east corner of the medieval wall to the outer north gate. From there the River Twyver formed a moat as the earthwork followed it north-west to Alvin Gate then on to the river's junction with the Old Severn.<ref name=Day65\u201366 /> This easternmost channel of the River Severn had dried up by the 19th century, but at the time of the civil war it was still a navigable river.<ref>Herbert 1988 para. 2</ref><ref>Rhodes 2006 p. 14</ref> The earthwork then followed the Old Severn south-west to a point a short distance north of Westgate Street, from where it was extended the other side of the Old Severn to the River Severn just above the west gate.<ref name=Day66>Day 2007 p. 66</ref> Inside the city, an earthwork was extended west from the end of the medieval wall at the inner north gate via [[Gloucester Cathedral]] to [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester|St Oswald's Priory]], where it met the new outer earthwork.<ref name=Day66 /> The outer north gate and Alvin Gate were fortified with earthwork [[bastion]]s,<ref name=Day66 /> a drawbridge was installed at Westgate Bridge and the Old Severn was dammed at Dockham, causing the ground to north-west of the city to flood.<ref>Rhodes 2006 pp. 17, 29\u201330</ref>\n\nThe garrison numbered no more than 1,500 troops. The bulk of these comprised two half-strength regiments each of some 600 men: the [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford|Earl of Stamford]]'s Regiment of Foot, recruited from London and Leicestershire, and a locally recruited regiment known as the Town Regiment. The remainder comprised a company of [[Trained bands|trained band]], 100 [[dragoon]]s and a [[troop]] of cavalry. The city's dozen or so artillery pieces ranged in size from light cannon to two nine-pounder [[demi-culverin]]s. Stamford's regiment was experienced and well led, though of uncertain discipline. The Town Regiment lacked experience but was motivated by its ties to the city it was defending, although there is evidence that some of its men would refuse to oppose the King. The city could support itself with basic necessities, but it lacked sufficient gunpowder to withstand an assault or prolonged siege.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 63\u201365</ref>\n\nMassey was an autocratic military commander, but his authority in the city was shared with the civilian administration. A committee had been established in December 1642 to manage the Parliamentarian war effort in the county, but [[Thomas Pury]], the [[member of parliament]] for Gloucester, was the only committee member in the city. Civic authority was held by a forty-member council, though in practice an inner core of some fifteen [[Alderman|aldermen]], including the mayor, wielded power. As many of these were, like Pury, officers in the city's garrison, political and military command was largely integrated.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 66\u201367</ref> In the days immediately following the fall of Bristol, morale in the city, both military and civilian, was low.<ref>Day 2007 p. 68</ref> It's possible that this was what prompted Massey consider surrendering the city, though his message suggesting he would may have been a subterfuge designed to buy some time.<ref>Day 2007 p. 73</ref> There is strong evidence that the conduct and actions of the city elite, including Massey and particularly Pury, did much to stiffen the city's resolve. Officers and councillors with Royalist sympathies were given the opportunity to leave, and those who remained were required to restate an oath of allegiance to Parliament. The discipline of the troops was improved by paying them, and civilians were kept busy reinforcing the city's defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\n==Siege==\nAs Charles marched north from Bristol, reinforcements were converging on Gloucester from Oxford, Worcester and Herefordshire.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 86\u201387</ref> By the afternoon of 10 August the Royalist army, comprising some 6,000 infantry and 2,500 mounted troops, began assembling around the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 90\u201391</ref> Charles set up his headquarters at [[Matson, Gloucester|Matson]] House.<ref>Day 2007 p. 97</ref> His demand for Gloucester's surrender was unanimously and somewhat insolently rejected, and the Parliamentarians set fire to the suburbs outside the city defences to clear lines of fire and deprive the Royalists of cover.<ref>Day 2007 pp. , 91\u201393,96</ref> Charles had decided to march on Gloucester in the belief that the city would be quickly surrendered. Now that gambit had failed, he decided to besiege it. His pride had been wounded by the manner of the Parliamentarian rejection. His commanders, assessing the state of the city's defences, supplies and morale, persuaded him the city could be taken within ten days without an assault. Intelligence indicated the even if the Parliamentarians were able to send a relieving force, it could be easily defeated before it could reach the city. Most decisively, the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]], whose support was necessary in any campaign against London, declared himself unable to march south while Hull remained in Parliamentarian hands, leaving Charles too weak to contemplate such a move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 93\u201395</ref>\n\n===First ten days===\n\n[[File:SoG 2.jpg|thumb|upright=2|Royalist dispositions during the siege]]\nThe first shots were fired in the afternoon as Sir [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Jacob Astley]] established his forces near Issold's House on the eastern side of the city. [[Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Forth|Lord Forth]], who had been given overall command of the siege, set up a fortified leaguer to the rear of the ruined [[Llanthony Secunda Priory]] and established his forces to the south of the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 95\u201396, 99, 100\u2013101</ref> By dawn on 11 August, a line of trenches had been dug some {{convert|130|yd|m}} from the walls, placing the two sides within musket range of each other, stretching from [[Brunswick Square, Gloucester|Gaudy Green]] on the south side to Issold's House on the east.<ref>Day 2007 p. 99</ref> Massey responded with spoiling tactics in an attempt to hinder Royalist siege operations and delay the assault he was expecting. At midnight a small raiding party succeeded in disrupting Royalist entrenching operations on Gaudy Green, and a larger raid on the green the next morning, 12 August, resulted in the capture of Royalist men, tools and weapons.<ref>Day 2007 p. 100</ref> By this time, the reinforcements from Herefordshire and Worcester under the command of Sir William Vavasour arrived on the west bank of the Severn and began crossing the river to take up positions at Kingsholm, to the north of the city. This force increased the size of the besieging army by another 2,400 infantry and over 300 cavalry. They too were the target of a Parliamentarian raid which inflicted up to fifteen casualties on the Royalists.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 100</ref>\n\nLater on 12 August, Forth completed an earthwork square on Gaudy Green, in which he placed two 24-pounders, the largest of the Royalist's eight cannon, along with a 12-pounder to target the south wall. Another artillery emplacement was positioned to target the east wall nearby.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 99\u2013102</ref> With the artillery in place, the Royalists began bombarding the walls, with the main effort beginning at 11:00 on 13 August. The cannon were too light to have any significant impact, and of the two mortars the Royalists possessed, one, reputed to be the largest in the country, exploded on its first use. When it became evident the Royalists were focusing their efforts on the south-east corner of the city defences, Massey quickly buttressed the medieval walls with up to {{convert|5|ft|m}} of earth, which ensured that the defences held. Meanwhile, the majority of Vavasour's troops completed their crossing of the Severn, leaving behind a small contingent to blockade the west bank.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 100\u2013102</ref>\n\nReacting to rumours that Vavasour had received a reinforcement of artillery, the Parliamentarians mounted another raid to the north of the city on 14 August. They captured two prisoners but failed in their primary objective of locating and spiking any guns.<ref>Day 2007 p. 102</ref> The Royalist bombardment continued through 14 August, but a breach blown in the wall by the larger guns on Gaudy Green was quickly plugged by the defenders with woolsacks and [[gabion]]s. Royalist engineers mining towards the walls from trenches at the green succeeded in draining the ditch below the walls, but this was not followed up with an assault. By the end of the day the Royalist guns had fallen silent; the evidence suggests they had run out of ammunition.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 102\u2013103</ref>\n\nThe following day Vavasour received a reinforcement of 500 [[Glamorgan]] militia and 450 musketeers from Bristol, while the Parliamentarians bolstered the earthwork defences around the south and north gates. On 16 August Rupert accompanied Charles to Oxford, and neither were at Gloucester to witness the most ambitious Parliamentarian raid yet. Just before sunset, 150 musketeers of Stamford's regiment sallied out of the north gate to attack the Royalist trenches east of the city. The Parliamentarians claimed 100 Royalist killed for the cost of 2 injured, while Royalist sources report 24 Parliamentarians killed and more wounded, for the loss of 4 Royalists killed.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 103\u2013105</ref>\n\nStruggling with a shortage of gunpowder and with the guns quiet, the Royalists concentrated on mining operations to breach the city walls. Miners recruited from the [[Forest of Dean]] were set to work under a protective gallery to fill the {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} deep by {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} wide moat which, when completed, would allow them to undermine the walls. It was slow work, estimated to need a week to complete. The faster alternative was to forgo the protection and fill the moat with [[fascine]]s. An attempt to do this was beaten back by musket fire from the walls, and resulted in the desertion of the miners.<ref>Day 2007 103, 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy 18 August Vavasour had deployed three cannon in front of his main camp at Kingsholm and another opposite Alvin Gate. These were the targets of a Parliamentarian raid that morning that was even larger than previous efforts; a diversionary attack by 50 men and a main force of 400. All four of Vavasour's cannon were disabled, the Parliamentarians claiming over 100 Royalist casualties for the loss of 6, the Royalists admitting 28 casualties and claiming to have killed 27 Parliamentarians. Another Parliamentarian raid the same day involved their only recorded use of cavalry during the siege, when 150 musketeers and 40 cavalry mounted an ineffectual attack on Royalist positions to the east of the city. Charles, meanwhile, was on his way back to Gloucester with another 1,000 reinforcements.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy the morning of 19 August, two 6-pounder cannon had been installed in a third emplacement opposite the east gate, bringing all the original artillery online. At 10:00, the bombardment was resumed in a last effort to subdue the city by the original ten-day deadline. Constrained by the limited supplies of ammunition and gunpowder, the bombardment had little material effect, though it prompted Massey to hastily erect a breastwork in the open ground of Friar's Orchard, at the south east corner of the city where the Royalist artillery was being concentrated. A Royalist attempt to cross the moat after dark was beaten back by musket fire. The objective of forcing the surrender of Gloucester by siege in ten days had failed, partly due to the city's resolve and Massey's spoiling attacks, but mainly due to the inadequacy of the Royalist artillery.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 107\u2013109</ref>\n\n===Shift of focus to mining===\n\nThe Parliamentarians mounted another raid at dawn on 21 August. It was a two-pronged attack designed to disable the Royalist artillery south and east of the walls. One detachment travelled by boat down the Severn, landed between Forth's camp and a redoubt opposite the castle and successfuly stormed the redoubt. The second detachment of 200 musketeers sallied from the north gate. Intending first to attack the battery opposite the east gate, this force became lost and blundered into Royalist infantry camps. When Massey saw that the raid was not going to plan, he sounded the recall. The Parliamentarians suffered eight casualties, the Royalists more than twenty. Such raids were proving risky and wasteful of the garrison's limited ammunition, and this was the last large-scale operation mounted by the Parliamentarians.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 112\u2013113</ref>\n\nAs the Royalists set about replenishing their stocks of ammunition, they intensified their mining efforts. It was anticipated that the original effort to bridge the moat would allow the besiegers to reach the east wall on 24 August. A second effort to bridge the moat to the south was begun, as was a more complicated project to tunnel towards the east gate. Royalist agents attempted to persuade the garrison to surrender, and Royalist cavalry staged a mock battle in an unsuccessful attempt to lure the garrison out of the city in the belief that a relief force had arrived.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 114\u2013115</ref> A desultory bombardment was maintained, particularly by the mortars, until 25 August, when it was intensified. An attempt that day by Massey to disrupt it with a sally from the north gate was beaten back by cavalry, but as before, a shortage of ammunition \u2013 at one stage the Royalists resorted to firing stones \u2013 blunted the impact, and little damage was done to the city.<ref>Day 2007 p. 116</ref>\n\nFollowing news that the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] was raising a Parliamentarian army in London, Charles and Rupert travelled to Oxford on 26 August, where they held a two-day council of war. With no intelligence of Essex's plans, the Royalists bolstered the defences of Oxford with troops earmarked for the siege of Gloucester while the Royalist garrison at Bristol was urged to send all the forces it could spare to Gloucester. Believing that Essex could muster no more than 6,000 troops, the decision was made to continue the siege, though contingency plans for the blockade of Gloucester were drawn up in case it had to be lifted. [[Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester|Lord Wilmot]] was instructed to muster 2,000 cavalry around [[Banbury]]. Their task would be to delay the Parliamentarians in the [[Cotswolds]] until Rupert could come up with the rest of the Royalist cavalry in support, should Essex march to the relief of Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 117\u2013118</ref>\n\nEssex began his march from [[Colnbrook]], west of London, on 26 August.<ref>Day 2007 p. 127</ref> His plan was to relieve Gloucester without provoking a major battle in which, with the Royalist superiority in cavalry, he would be at a disdvantage. His route was dictated by the desire to minimise the amount of open country favourable to cavalry operations he would have to pass through, and took him north of Oxford via Aylesbury and Bicester and then across the Cotswolds.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 124\u2013126</ref> At the beginning of September Essex was due north of Oxford with an army of some 10,500 infantry, no more than 4,500 mounted troops and an artillery train that is estimated at no more than 50 guns.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 130\u2013131, 133</ref>\n\nMining was now the principal tactic by which the Royalists hoped to bring the siege to a successful conclusion. Priority was given to tunnelling at the east gate, which caused progress on efforts to fill the moat below the south and east walls to slow, possibly as a result of a lack of miners and engineers. Parliamentarian countermining at the east gate on 28 August was quickly abandoned because of springs that caused flooding, which accounts for the slow pace of the Royalist efforts there.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 136\u2013138</ref> Massey continued to harass the besiegers with sniping and artillery fire, and he resumed countermining operations at the east gate after a reconnaissance party had reported Royalists miners were still working on their mine. The progress of the Royalist mines closer towards the walls, quickened by the arrival of Welsh miners on 29 August, led Massey to believe an assault was imminent. On 1 September he fortified Friars Orchard with an earthwork wall and [[Sconce (fortification)|sconce]], a fort in which he placed four pieces of artillery that could be brought to bear on any Royalists who broke through the south-east corner or the east gate.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 138\u2013140</ref>\n\nOn 3 September the Parliamentarians placed a [[Saker (cannon)|saker]] in a gun port they had been secretly building in east wall above the gallery protecting the Royalist miners. The medium-sized cannon was employed most of the day against the gallery, to little effect, until the Royalists targeted it with a cannon of their own, at which point it was withdrawn. The Royalists anticipated their mine would reach the east gate the next day, while they believed Essex could be delayed in the Cotswolds for four days. The Bristol garrison was being stripped for reinforcements and orders had been sent to Oxford for ten field guns and the equipment necessary to make the guns already at Gloucester mobile, should it become necessary to redeploy them from siegework to use in open battle.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 140\u2013141</ref>\n\n===Approach of the relief army===\n\nBy the end of 3 September Essex's lead element, the London brigade, was at [[Oddington, Gloucestershire|Oddington]], {{convert|2|mi|km}} east of [[Stow-on-the-Wold]]. The Parliamentarian army was largely untroubled by Wilmot's Royalist cavalry, and because of the differing rates of march it was strung out as far back as [[Chipping Norton]], nearly {{convert|6|mi|km}} to the east. Meanwhile Rupert had led the rest of the Royalist cavalry from Gloucester and, having rendezvoused with Wilmot, ended the day with some 5,000 men camped around [[Bourton-on-the-Water]], {{convert|4|mi|km}} south-west of Stow.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 141\u2013143, 146</ref> The next day the two forces clashed. Although Rupert enjoyed superior numbers, he was dissuaded from pressing his advantage by the appearance of [[Edmund Harvey]] with a regiment of Parliamentarian cavalry and two of infantry. When Essex arrived with the rest of the Parliamentarian army, Rupert was forced into a steady retreat to the area of [[Andoversford]] and [[Compton Abdale]], while Essex's army ended the day around [[Naunton]]. Rupert had been surprised by the size of Essex's force and the skill with which it was handled, and had completely failed in his mission to delay it.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 144\u2013147, 148</ref>\n\nIn Gloucester the Parliamentarians could see the evacuation of some 400 sick or wounded Royalists and the dispatch of some artillery away from the siege, but also the arrival of 2,000 infantry and 500 mounted reinforcements from Bristol. The defender's countermine reached outside the east gate, where they discovered and began boring down on the deeper Royalist mine, while inside the gate an earthwork was completed across the road and the buildings either side were turned into [[blockhouse]]s. They were critically low on gunpowder, but buoyed by the sight of fires lit on nearby Wainlode Hill signalling the approach of Essex. The Royalists, meanwhile, were readying the heavy guns to move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 147\u2013148</ref>\n\nOn 5 September Essex took the quickest way off the open country of the Cotswold hills down into the relative safety of the Severn valley. This meant descending the steep escarpment at Prestbury Hill towards [[Cheltenham]], rather than heading directly to Gloucester. His lead elements began the difficult descent at dusk, but the baggage train and rearguard were forced to spend the night in worsening weather in the hills. Rupert, who appears to have expected a more direct march on Gloucester, could do little to harass the Parliamentarians, and returned to Gloucester. There he covered the Royalist army as it lifted the siege and withdrew to Matson, {{convert|2|mi|km}} south-east of the city. Charles had already departed his headquarters there and ridden ahead to [[Painswick]]. The defenders inside the city did not know how close Essex was and, not quite believing the siege was over, did not harry the retreating Royalists but remained vigilant behind their defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 148\u2013151</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nRoyalist casualties during the siege were claimed to be in the range of 1,000 to over 1,500, the Parliamentarian losses ranging from 30 to 50. Royalist sources concede 120 killed during the siege, with reports of sick and wounded giving numbers of 900, 400 and 300. [[Jon Day]] gives a conservative estimate of Royalist casualties as 1,200 killed, wounded and sick, with another 800 lost to desertion.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 155, 168</ref> The siege had come close to succeeding, and by the end of it the defenders were down to their last barrels of gunpowder. It is unlikely they would have been able to withstand an assault, but because of Charles's aversion to casualties, none was ever attempted. Massey's aggressive tactics were a critical factor in the successful defence of the city, and ensured that morale never dropped to the low levels witnessed before the siege began. The Royalists specifically identified his countermining as the reason for lifting the siege. The Royalist artillery proved inadequate to the task of siege work, and the 300\u2013400 large cannon balls and 20+ mortar bombs that were fired on the city failed to blow any major breach in the walls, start any significant fires or cause more than a handful of casualties.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 154\u2013155</ref>\n\nAlthough the failure at Gloucester adversely affected Royalist morale, the campaign presented Charles with an opportunity to inflict a decisive blow against his enemy. The Parliamentarian army and its trained band reserves had effectively been lured out of a strong position behind the London defences, into open country where they could be more easily defeated. Against a Parliamentarian army some 14,500 strong, the Royalist army of 9,000 infantry and 6,000 cavalry was slightly inferior in the quantity of infantry but superior in cavalry by a factor of three to two. The arrival of additional guns ordered from Oxford during the siege gave the Royalists parity in artillery.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 165, 167\u2013168</ref>\n\nEssex's objective after the siege was to evade the Royalist army and return his own intact to London. In a feint designed to draw Charles away from his intended route back to London, Essex marched north to [[Tewkesbury]], where he could better supply his army and threaten Royalist Worcester.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 171\u2013172</ref> When Charles marched his army after him, Essex retraced his steps back to Cheltenham. With the Royalists concentrated around [[Evesham]] and [[Pershore]], he struck out back across the Cotswolds in the direction of Cirencester, where he defeated the 400-strong Royalist garrison on 16 September.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 175, 177\u2013178</ref>\n\nEssex believed he had etablished a commanding lead over Charles and, not wishing to drive his hungry army too hard, slowed his pace on the march to [[Swindon]].<ref>Day 2007 pp. 184\u2013185</ref> He was further slowed after Swindon when Rupert's cavalry caught up, and the resulting [[Battle of Aldbourne Chase]] on 18 September allowed the rest of the Royalist army to close the distance.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 186\u2013192</ref> Charles finally brought Essex to battle on 20 September in the [[First Battle of Newbury]], but failed to defeat him, allowing the Parliamentarians to reach the safety of their London stronghold four days later.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 226, 269, 280</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nProfessor [[David Daube]] suggested in ''[[The Oxford Magazine]]'' of 16 February 1956 that the nursery rhyme [[Humpty Dumpty]] originated from a [[siege engine]] used at Gloucester, based on a contemporary account of the attack, but without evidence that the rhyme was connected.<ref>Daube 2009 pp. 365\u2013366.</ref> The theory was part of an anonymous series of articles on the origin of nursery rhymes and was widely acclaimed in academia,<ref>Rodger 1999</ref> but it was derided by others as \"ingenuity for ingenuity's sake\" and declared to be a spoof.<ref>Opie 2004 p. 76.</ref><ref>Opie 1997 p. 254</ref>\n\nFor centuries afterwards, the lifting of the siege was marked by an annual [[Gloucester Day]]. This died out in the nineteenth century but was reinstated in 2009.<ref name=bbc>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/gloucestershire/8239588.stm Tradition revived for city pride.] BBC News, 5 September 2009.

This process often also includes the rebuilding of the nipple and areola, known as nipple-areola complex (NAC) reconstruction, as one of the final stages.\n\nGenerally, the aesthetic appearance is acceptable to the woman, but the reconstructed area is commonly completely numb afterwards, which results in loss of sexual function as well as the ability to perceive [[pain]] caused by [[burn]]s and other injuries.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/29/well/live/after-mastectomies-an-unexpected-blow-numb-new-breasts.html|title=After Mastectomies, an Unexpected Blow: Numb New Breasts|last=Rabin|first=Roni Caryn|date=2017-01-29|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-03-31|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n== Timing ==\nBreast reconstruction can be performed either immediately following the mastectomy or as a separate procedure at a later date, known as immediate reconstruction and delayed reconstruction, respectively. The decision of when breast reconstruction will take place is patient-specific and based on many different factors. Breast reconstruction is a large undertaking that usually requires multiple operations.  These subsequent surgeries may be spread out over weeks or months. \n\n=== Immediate reconstruction ===\nBreast reconstruction is termed \"immediate\" when it takes place during the same procedure as the mastectomy. Within the United States, approximately 35% of women who have undergone a total mastectomy for breast cancer will choose to pursue immediate breast reconstruction.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Plastic surgery.|others=Neligan, Peter,, Warren, Richard J.,, Van Beek, Allen|isbn=978-0-323-35695-4|edition=4th|location=London|oclc=1006385273|date = 2017-08-08}}</ref>  One of the inherent advantages of immediate reconstruction is the potential for a single-stage procedure. This also means that the cost of immediate reconstruction is often far less to the patient.  It can also reduce hospital costs by having fewer procedures and requiring a shorter length of the stay as an inpatient.<ref name=\":3\" />  Additionally, immediate reconstruction often has a better cosmetic result because of the preservation of anatomic landmarks and skin.<ref name=\":2\" /> With regards to psychosocial outcomes, opinions on timing have shifted in favor of immediate reconstruction. Originally, delayed reconstruction was believed to provide patients with time to psychologically adjust to the mastectomy and its effects on body image. However, this opinion is no longer widely held.<ref name=\":2\" /> Compared to delayed procedures, immediate reconstruction can have a more positive psychological impact on patients and their self-esteem, most likely due to the post-operative breast more closely resembling the natural breast compared to the defect left by mastectomy alone.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Delayed reconstruction ===\nDelayed breast reconstruction is considered more challenging than immediate reconstruction. Frequently not just breast volume, but also skin surface area needs to be restored. Many patients undergoing delayed breast reconstruction have been previously treated with radiation or have had a reconstruction failure with immediate breast reconstruction. In nearly all cases of delayed breast reconstruction tissue must be borrowed from another part of the body to make the new breast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drdec.com/#!immediate-or-delayed/c1blj|title=Breast Reconstruction: Immediate or Delayed}}</ref> Patients expected to receive [[radiation therapy]] as part of their adjuvant treatment are also commonly considered for delayed autologous reconstruction due to significantly higher complication rates with tissue expander-implant techniques in those patients.<ref name=\":3\" />  While waiting to begin breast reconstruction until several months after radiation therapy may decrease the risk of complications, this risk will always be higher in patients who have received radiation therapy.<ref name=\":3\" /> As with many other surgeries, patients with significant medical comorbidities (e.g., [[high blood pressure]], [[obesity]], [[diabetes]]) and [[Tobacco smoking|smokers]] are higher-risk candidates.<ref name=\":3\" />  Surgeons may choose to perform delayed reconstruction to decrease this risk.\n\n==Techniques==\nThere are several techniques for breast reconstruction.  These options are broadly categorized into two different groups:[[File:Blausen 0138 BreastReconstruction Expander.png|thumb|Breast reconstruction using a tissue expander, which is later replaced by a permanent prosthetic implant.]]\n=== Implant-based reconstruction ===\nThis is the most common technique used worldwide.  Implant-based reconstruction is an option for patients who have sufficient skin after mastectomy to cover a prosthetic implant and allow for a natural shape.  For women undergoing bilateral mastectomies, implants provide the greatest opportunity for symmetrical shape and lift.  Additionally, these procedures are generally much faster than flap-based reconstruction since tissue does not have to be taken from another part of the patient's body.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Sabiston textbook of surgery : the biological basis of modern surgical practice|publisher=|others=Townsend, Courtney M., Jr.,, Beauchamp, R.

In surgery, a \"flap\" is any type of tissue that is lifted from a donor site and moved to a recipient site using its own blood supply.  Flap-based reconstruction may be performed either by leaving the donor tissue connected to the original site to retain its blood supply (where the vessels are tunneled beneath the skin surface to the new site) or by cutting the donor tissue's vessels and surgically reconnecting them to a new blood supply at the recipient site.<ref>{{cite web|title=Breast cancer {{!}} Breast reconstruction using body tissue {{!}} Cancer Research UK|url=http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/breast-cancer/treatment/surgery/breast-reconstruction/using-body-tissue#collapseListRefeferences|website=www.cancerresearchuk.org}}</ref>[[File:Blausen 0140 BreastReconstruction TRAM.png|thumb|Transverse Rectus Abdominis Myocutaneous flap (TRAM).]]One option for breast reconstruction involves using the [[latissimus dorsi muscle]] as the donor tissue.  As a back muscle, the latissimus dorsi is large and flat and can be used without significant loss of function.  It can be moved into the breast defect while still attached to its blood supply under the arm pit (axilla). A latissimus flap is often used to recruit soft-tissue coverage over an underlying implant; however, if the latissimus flap can provide enough volume, then occasionally it is used to reconstruct small breasts without the need for an implant.  The latissimus dorsi flap has a number of advantages, but despite the advances in surgical techniques, it has remained vulnerable to skin dehiscence or necrosis at the donor site (on the back).<ref name=\":2\" /> The Mannu flap is a form of latissimus dorsi flap which avoids this complication by preserving a generous subcutaneous fat layer at the donor site and has been shown to be a safe, simple and effective way of avoiding wound dehiscence at the donor site after extended latissimus dorsi flap reconstruction.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mannu|first1=Gurdeep S.|last2=Farooq|first2=Naheed|last3=Down|first3=Sue|last4=Burger|first4=Amy|last5=Hussien|first5=Maged I.|year=2013|title=Avoiding back wound dehiscence in extended latissimus dorsi flap reconstruction|journal=ANZ Journal of Surgery|volume=83|issue=5|pages=359\u201364|doi=10.1111/j.1445-2197.2012.06292.x|pmid=23088555}}</ref>[[File:Blausen 0141 BreastReconstruction TRAM PostOp.png|thumb|Post-operative state after Transverse Rectus Abdominis Myocutaneous flap(TRAM).]]Another possible donor site for breast reconstruction is the abdomen.  The TRAM (transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous) flap or its technically distinct variants of microvascular \"perforator flaps\" like the DIEP/SIEA flaps are all commonly used.  In a TRAM procedure, a portion of the abdominal tissue, which includes skin, subcutaneous fat, minor muscles, and connective tissues, is taken from the patient's abdomen and transplanted to the breast site.  Both TRAM and DIEP/SIEA use the abdominal tissue between the umbilicus (or \"belly button\") and the pubis. The [[DIEP flap]] and free-TRAM flap require advanced microsurgical technique and are less common as a result. Both can provide enough tissue to reconstruct large breasts and are a good option for patients who would prefer to maintain their pre-operative breast volume. These procedures are preferred by some breast cancer patients because removal of the donor site tissue results in an [[abdominoplasty]] (tummy tuck) and allow the breast to be reconstructed with one's own tissues instead of a prosthetic implant that uses foreign material.  That said, TRAM flap procedures can potentially weaken the abdominal wall and torso strength, but they are generally well tolerated by most patients.<ref name=\":2\" />  Perforator techniques such as the DIEP (deep inferior epigastric perforator) flap and SIEA (superficial inferior epigastric artery) flap require precise dissection of small perforating vessels through the rectus muscle and, thus, do not require removal of abdominal muscle.  Because of this, these flaps have the advantage of maintaining the majority of abdominal wall strength.\n\nOther donor sites for autologous breast reconstruction include the buttocks, which provides tissue for the SGAP and IGAP (superior and inferior gluteal artery perforator, respectively) flaps. The purpose of perforator flaps (DIEP, SIEA, SGAP, IGAP) is to provide sufficient skin and fat for an aesthetic reconstruction while minimizing post-operative complications from harvesting the underlying muscles.

Impressions can be made and photographs can be used to accurately replace the nipple lost with some types of mastectomies. This can be instrumental in restoring the psychological well-being of the breast cancer survivor. The same process can be used to replicate the remaining nipple in cases of a single mastectomy.

It involves using [[autologous]] tissue, [[prosthesis|prosthetic]] implants, or a combination of both with the goal of reconstructing a natural-looking breast.  This process often also includes the rebuilding of the nipple and areola, known as nipple-areola complex (NAC) reconstruction, as one of the final stages.\n\nGenerally, the aesthetic appearance is acceptable to the woman, but the reconstructed area is commonly completely numb afterwards, which results in loss of sexual function as well as the ability to perceive [[pain]] caused by [[burn]]s and other injuries.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/29/well/live/after-mastectomies-an-unexpected-blow-numb-new-breasts.html|title=After Mastectomies, an Unexpected Blow: Numb New Breasts|last=Rabin|first=Roni Caryn|date=2017-01-29|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-03-31|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n== Timing ==\nBreast reconstruction can be performed either immediately following the mastectomy or as a separate procedure at a later date, known as immediate reconstruction and delayed reconstruction, respectively. The decision of when breast reconstruction will take place is patient-specific and based on many different factors. Breast reconstruction is a large undertaking that usually requires multiple operations.  These subsequent surgeries may be spread out over weeks or months. \n\n=== Immediate reconstruction ===\nBreast reconstruction is termed \"immediate\" when it takes place during the same procedure as the mastectomy. Within the United States, approximately 35% of women who have undergone a total mastectomy for breast cancer will choose to pursue immediate breast reconstruction.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Plastic surgery.|others=Neligan, Peter,, Warren, Richard J.,, Van Beek, Allen|isbn=978-0-323-35695-4|edition=4th|location=London|oclc=1006385273|date = 2017-08-08}}</ref>  One of the inherent advantages of immediate reconstruction is the potential for a single-stage procedure. This also means that the cost of immediate reconstruction is often far less to the patient.  It can also reduce hospital costs by having fewer procedures and requiring a shorter length of the stay as an inpatient.<ref name=\":3\" />  Additionally, immediate reconstruction often has a better cosmetic result because of the preservation of anatomic landmarks and skin.<ref name=\":2\" /> With regards to psychosocial outcomes, opinions on timing have shifted in favor of immediate reconstruction. Originally, delayed reconstruction was believed to provide patients with time to psychologically adjust to the mastectomy and its effects on body image. However, this opinion is no longer widely held.<ref name=\":2\" /> Compared to delayed procedures, immediate reconstruction can have a more positive psychological impact on patients and their self-esteem, most likely due to the post-operative breast more closely resembling the natural breast compared to the defect left by mastectomy alone.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Delayed reconstruction ===\nDelayed breast reconstruction is considered more challenging than immediate reconstruction. Frequently not just breast volume, but also skin surface area needs to be restored. Many patients undergoing delayed breast reconstruction have been previously treated with radiation or have had a reconstruction failure with immediate breast reconstruction. In nearly all cases of delayed breast reconstruction tissue must be borrowed from another part of the body to make the new breast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drdec.com/#!immediate-or-delayed/c1blj|title=Breast Reconstruction: Immediate or Delayed}}</ref> Patients expected to receive [[radiation therapy]] as part of their adjuvant treatment are also commonly considered for delayed autologous reconstruction due to significantly higher complication rates with tissue expander-implant techniques in those patients.<ref name=\":3\" />  While waiting to begin breast reconstruction until several months after radiation therapy may decrease the risk of complications, this risk will always be higher in patients who have received radiation therapy.<ref name=\":3\" /> As with many other surgeries, patients with significant medical comorbidities (e.g., [[high blood pressure]], [[obesity]], [[diabetes]]) and [[Tobacco smoking|smokers]] are higher-risk candidates.<ref name=\":3\" />  Surgeons may choose to perform delayed reconstruction to decrease this risk.\n\n==Techniques==\nThere are several techniques for breast reconstruction.  These options are broadly categorized into two different groups:[[File:Blausen 0138 BreastReconstruction Expander.png|thumb|Breast reconstruction using a tissue expander, which is later replaced by a permanent prosthetic implant.]]\n=== Implant-based reconstruction ===\nThis is the most common technique used worldwide.  Implant-based reconstruction is an option for patients who have sufficient skin after mastectomy to cover a prosthetic implant and allow for a natural shape.  For women undergoing bilateral mastectomies, implants provide the greatest opportunity for symmetrical shape and lift.  Additionally, these procedures are generally much faster than flap-based reconstruction since tissue does not have to be taken from another part of the patient's body.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Sabiston textbook of surgery : the biological basis of modern surgical practice|publisher=|others=Townsend, Courtney M., Jr.,, Beauchamp, R.

In surgery, a \"flap\" is any type of tissue that is lifted from a donor site and moved to a recipient site using its own blood supply.  Flap-based reconstruction may be performed either by leaving the donor tissue connected to the original site to retain its blood supply (where the vessels are tunneled beneath the skin surface to the new site) or by cutting the donor tissue's vessels and surgically reconnecting them to a new blood supply at the recipient site.<ref>{{cite web|title=Breast cancer {{!}} Breast reconstruction using body tissue {{!}} Cancer Research UK|url=http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/breast-cancer/treatment/surgery/breast-reconstruction/using-body-tissue#collapseListRefeferences|website=www.cancerresearchuk.org}}</ref>[[File:Blausen 0140 BreastReconstruction TRAM.png|thumb|Transverse Rectus Abdominis Myocutaneous flap (TRAM).]]One option for breast reconstruction involves using the [[latissimus dorsi muscle]] as the donor tissue.  As a back muscle, the latissimus dorsi is large and flat and can be used without significant loss of function.  It can be moved into the breast defect while still attached to its blood supply under the arm pit (axilla). A latissimus flap is often used to recruit soft-tissue coverage over an underlying implant; however, if the latissimus flap can provide enough volume, then occasionally it is used to reconstruct small breasts without the need for an implant.  The latissimus dorsi flap has a number of advantages, but despite the advances in surgical techniques, it has remained vulnerable to skin dehiscence or necrosis at the donor site (on the back).<ref name=\":2\" /> The Mannu flap is a form of latissimus dorsi flap which avoids this complication by preserving a generous subcutaneous fat layer at the donor site and has been shown to be a safe, simple and effective way of avoiding wound dehiscence at the donor site after extended latissimus dorsi flap reconstruction.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mannu|first1=Gurdeep S.|last2=Farooq|first2=Naheed|last3=Down|first3=Sue|last4=Burger|first4=Amy|last5=Hussien|first5=Maged I.|year=2013|title=Avoiding back wound dehiscence in extended latissimus dorsi flap reconstruction|journal=ANZ Journal of Surgery|volume=83|issue=5|pages=359\u201364|doi=10.1111/j.1445-2197.2012.06292.x|pmid=23088555}}</ref>[[File:Blausen 0141 BreastReconstruction TRAM PostOp.png|thumb|Post-operative state after Transverse Rectus Abdominis Myocutaneous flap(TRAM).]]Another possible donor site for breast reconstruction is the abdomen.  The TRAM (transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous) flap or its technically distinct variants of microvascular \"perforator flaps\" like the DIEP/SIEA flaps are all commonly used.  In a TRAM procedure, a portion of the abdominal tissue, which includes skin, subcutaneous fat, minor muscles, and connective tissues, is taken from the patient's abdomen and transplanted to the breast site.  Both TRAM and DIEP/SIEA use the abdominal tissue between the umbilicus (or \"belly button\") and the pubis. The [[DIEP flap]] and free-TRAM flap require advanced microsurgical technique and are less common as a result. Both can provide enough tissue to reconstruct large breasts and are a good option for patients who would prefer to maintain their pre-operative breast volume. These procedures are preferred by some breast cancer patients because removal of the donor site tissue results in an [[abdominoplasty]] (tummy tuck) and allow the breast to be reconstructed with one's own tissues instead of a prosthetic implant that uses foreign material.  That said, TRAM flap procedures can potentially weaken the abdominal wall and torso strength, but they are generally well tolerated by most patients.<ref name=\":2\" />  Perforator techniques such as the DIEP (deep inferior epigastric perforator) flap and SIEA (superficial inferior epigastric artery) flap require precise dissection of small perforating vessels through the rectus muscle and, thus, do not require removal of abdominal muscle.  Because of this, these flaps have the advantage of maintaining the majority of abdominal wall strength.\n\nOther donor sites for autologous breast reconstruction include the buttocks, which provides tissue for the SGAP and IGAP (superior and inferior gluteal artery perforator, respectively) flaps. The purpose of perforator flaps (DIEP, SIEA, SGAP, IGAP) is to provide sufficient skin and fat for an aesthetic reconstruction while minimizing post-operative complications from harvesting the underlying muscles. DIEP reconstruction generally produces the best outcome for most women.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Eri\u0107|first=M.|last2=Mihi\u0107|first2=N.|last3=Krivoku\u0107a|first3=D.|date=2009-03-01|title=Breast reconstruction following mastectomy; patient's satisfaction|journal=Acta Chirurgica Belgica|volume=109|issue=2|pages=159\u2013166|doi=10.1080/00015458.2009.11680398|issn=0001-5458|pmid=19499674}}</ref>  See [[free flap breast reconstruction]] for more information.\n\nMold-assisted reconstruction is a potential adjunctive process to help in flap-based reconstruction.

Impressions can be made and photographs can be used to accurately replace the nipple lost with some types of mastectomies. This can be instrumental in restoring the psychological well-being of the breast cancer survivor. The same process can be used to replicate the remaining nipple in cases of a single mastectomy. Ideally, a prosthesis is made around the time of the mastectomy and it can be used just weeks after the surgery.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ward|first=Christopher M.|date=1985|title=The uses of external nipple-areola prostheses following reconstruction of a breast mound after mastectomy|journal=British Journal of Plastic Surgery|language=en|volume=38|issue=1|pages=51\u201354|doi=10.1016/0007-1226(85)90087-6|pmid=3967113}}</ref>\n*Nipple-areolar complex reconstruction can also be performed surgically.

During most of that time, they were the only two universities in [[England and Wales]], making the rivalry more intense than it is now.\n\nThe [[University of Oxford]] and the [[University of Cambridge]], sometimes collectively known as ''[[Oxbridge]]'', are the two [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation|oldest]] universities in England. Both were founded more than 800 years ago, and between them they have produced a large number of Britain's most prominent scientists, writers and politicians, as well as noted figures in many other fields. Yet for many of these centuries the two universities were unrecognisable as universities in the modern sense, as they were largely institutions for producing clergymen and were thus strongly tied to the Church. Competition between Oxford and Cambridge also has a long history, dating back to around 1208 when Cambridge was founded by scholars taking refuge from hostile townsmen in Oxford.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/univ/history/records.html |title=Early records &#124; University of Cambridge |publisher=Cam.ac.uk |date=2013-01-28 |accessdate=2015-07-29}}</ref>\n\n==Similarities between Oxford and Cambridge==\n[[Image:KingsCollegeChapelWest.jpg|300px|right|thumb|The chapel of [[King's College, Cambridge]]: a famous symbol of both the city and the university]]\n\n===Academic reputation===\nIn 2012 the Times Higher Education World Reputation Rankings, based on a survey of 13,388 academics over 131 countries which was then the largest evaluation of academic reputation to date<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/mar/10/world-top-100-universities-reputation-rankings-reputation-times-higher-education | title=World's top 100 universities 2011: their reputations ranked by Times Higher Education | newspaper= Guardian | accessdate=26 March 2011 | location=UK | first=Ami | last=Sedghi | date=10 March 2011}}</ref> found that both Cambridge and Oxford belonged to the elite group of six universities touted as the 'globally recognized super brands';<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2010-2011/reputation-rankings.html|title=Top Universities by Reputation 2011|magazine=Times Higher Education|accessdate=26 March 2011|location=UK|date=10 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine | url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2010-2011/reputation-analysis.html | title=Six 'super brands': their reputations precede them | magazine= Times Higher Education | accessdate=26 March 2011 | location=UK | date=10 March 2011}}</ref> The other four were [[Harvard University]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and [[Stanford University]].\n\n===Institutions and facilities===\nOxford and Cambridge both have:\n* well-regarded publishing houses ([[Oxford University Press]] and [[Cambridge University Press]])\n* [[botanical garden]]s ([[University of Oxford Botanic Garden]] and [[Cambridge University Botanic Garden]])\n* museums (the [[Ashmolean Museum|Ashmolean]] and the [[Fitzwilliam Museum|Fitzwilliam]])\n* [[legal deposit|legal deposit libraries]] (the [[Bodleian Library|Bodleian]] and the [[Cambridge University Library]])\n* [[debate|debating]] societies (the [[Oxford Union]] and the [[Cambridge Union]])\n* [[business school]]s (the [[Sa\u00efd Business School]] and the [[Judge Business School]])\n* [[science park]]s ([[Oxford Science Park]] and [[Cambridge Science Park]])\n* theatrical societies and groups (the [[Oxford University Dramatic Society]], [[The Oxford Imps]] and [[The Oxford Revue]]; the [[Footlights|Cambridge Footlights]], The [[Cambridge University Amateur Dramatic Club]] and the [[Marlowe Society]])\n\n===Collegiate structure===\nOxford and Cambridge also share a common [[Collegiate university|collegiate structure]]: each university has more than 30 semi-autonomous residential colleges (see [[Colleges of the University of Cambridge]], [[Colleges of the University of Oxford]]), which provide the environments in which students live, work and sleep.\n\nApplicants must choose a specific college when applying to Oxford or Cambridge, or allow the university to select one for them, as every undergraduate and graduate student must be a member of one of the colleges.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/colleges/choosing_a_college/index.html|title=Choosing a college|publisher=Oxford University|accessdate=6 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/colleges/|title=The Colleges|publisher=Cambridge University|accessdate=6 May 2010}}</ref> However, all colleges are part of the university and students studying the same subject attend the same lectures and exams, irrespective of which college they belong. Degrees are also awarded by the central university and not by the individual colleges.\n\nColleges within each university regularly compete with each other in a variety of sporting and other events (e.g. [[Rugby union|rugby]], [[Sport rowing|rowing]], athletics and [[chess]]), but will pool their talent to form university teams for inter-university contests.\n\n===Teaching method===\nThe principal method of undergraduate teaching (other than lectures) is the [[Tutorial|\"supervision\" or \"tutorial\"]]: terms used at Cambridge and Oxford respectively, though the meaning is the same. These are typically weekly or more frequent hour-long sessions in which small groups of students \u2013 usually between one and three \u2013 meet with a member of the university's teaching staff or a doctoral student. Students are normally required to complete an essay or assignment in advance of the supervision/tutorial, which they will discuss with the supervisor/tutor during the session, along with any concerns or difficulties they have had with the material presented in that week's lectures. Students typically receive one to four tutorials/supervisions per week.<ref>[http://www.quns.cam.ac.uk/imagedisplay.asp?I_ID=54 ]{{dead link|date=July 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Neighbouring universities and other institutions===\nWithin the cities of Oxford and Cambridge are campuses of other universities, respectively [[Oxford Brookes University]] and [[Anglia Ruskin University]]. In addition, various [[English language learning and teaching|English language schools]], secretarial and other non-university colleges are based in the two cities.\n\n===Production of educational materials===\nBoth Oxford and Cambridge have lent their names to educational materials and institutions associated with the two universities. In addition to their printing houses, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' is a prominent English-language dictionary worldwide, while [[Cambridge Assessment]] provides a number of widely recognised qualifications for students (including [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSEs]], [[GCE Advanced Level|A-levels]] and English-language proficiency certificates such as the [[Certificate in Advanced English]]).\n\n==Differences between Oxford and Cambridge==\n\n===The cities===\nThe city of [[Oxford]] is larger (having a population about 30 per cent greater than Cambridge's in 2007)<ref>[http://www.cambridge.gov.uk/ccm/content/policy-and-projects/population-statistics.en;jsessionid=AE884228F26AB5D190C5211EE4C8CC12]{{dead link|date=October 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>[http://www.oxford.gov.uk/community/popnstats.cfm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412023335/http://www.oxford.gov.uk/community/popnstats.cfm |date=12 April 2009 }}</ref> and has historically been more urban and industrial, whilst [[Cambridge]] more closely resembles an agricultural [[market town]]. Oxford is associated with the motor industry ([[BMW]] currently produce the [[Mini (BMW)|Mini]] in Oxford, and several [[Formula One]] teams are based in [[Oxfordshire]] and neighbouring counties), whereas the area surrounding Cambridge is known as [[Silicon Fen]]\u2014one of the most important technology centres in Europe\u2014that has presence of large companies like [[Microsoft]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], [[ARM architecture|ARM]], along with many medical technology firms.\n\nBoth cities were built near rivers. However, the sole river is more prominent in Cambridge, flowing through the city centre rather than the two rivers ([[River Thames|Thames]] and [[River Cherwell|Cherwell]]) which flow around the centre of Oxford. [[punt (boat)|Punting]] is especially popular in Cambridge along the famous stretch called 'The Backs', which features a number of bridges and 'the backs' of several colleges that abut the [[River Cam]] (punting is also popular at Oxford).\n\nDespite many ancient buildings in both Oxford and Cambridge, there are also distinct differences in architecture. Oxford has a uniformity of building material, as a large proportion of the buildings are in the local sandstone. Cambridge, on the other hand, has little local stone, so the building material has been brought in from many different sources, resulting in a greater variety of character. The contrasts in architecture in Cambridge are more pronounced, as can be seen when comparing [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]] with the neighbouring [[Senate House (University of Cambridge)|Senate House]].\n\nOxford is featured more often in literature and [[film|the cinema]]; films with scenes shot in Oxford include [[Shadowlands (1985 film)|Shadowlands]] and the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' movies, while Radcliffe Square was used in the filming of ''[[His Dark Materials: Northern Lights]]''. The television series ''[[Inspector Morse (TV series)|Inspector Morse]]'' and ''[[Lewis (TV series)|Lewis]]'' are also set in Oxford. Cambridge may be best known in film as the real-life location of the court race scene portrayed in the film [[Chariots of Fire]] (although the scene was filmed at [[Eton College]] instead), or for the television series [[Porterhouse Blue]].\n\n===Tradition===\nThere are differences in the terminology traditionally used at the two universities. For example:\n* At Oxford, the three terms of the academic year are called [[Michaelmas term|Michaelmas]], [[Hilary term|Hilary]] and [[Trinity term|Trinity]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/about_the_university/university_year/dates_of_term.html |title=Dates of Term &#124; University of Oxford |publisher=Ox.ac.uk |date=2015-06-24 |accessdate=2015-07-29}}</ref> whereas at Cambridge they are Michaelmas, [[Lent term|Lent]] and [[Easter term|Easter]] (the Easter term is sometimes called \"Exam term\").<ref>[http://www.cam.ac.uk/univ/termdates.html Term dates], University of Cambridge</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cusu.cam.ac.uk/academic/exams/examinfo.pdf |title=Tips for Help in Exam Term |publisher=Cambridge University Students' Union |format=PDF |accessdate=5 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606012650/http://www.cusu.cam.ac.uk/academic/exams/examinfo.pdf |archive-date=6 June 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>Constitution of the Churchill College Junior Common Room</ref>\n* The large enclosed squares of grass found in most colleges are referred to as \"courts\" in Cambridge and \"quadrangles\" (or \"quads\") in Oxford.\n* College cleaners in the two Universities go by different names: in Oxford they are 'scouts' and in Cambridge they are '[[bedder]]s'.<ref>Frank Stubbings, ''Bedders, Bulldogs and Bedells: a Cambridge Glossary,'' {{ISBN|0-521-47978-9}}</ref>\n* A Doctor of Philosophy degree is referred to as a \"Ph.D.\" in Cambridge and a \"D.Phil.\" at Oxford.<ref>[http://web2.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/prospective/dphil/]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224152702/http://web2.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/prospective/dphil/ |date=24 February 2009 }}</ref>\n* The regular teaching meetings between student and tutor are called [[Tutorial|\"tutorials\"]] at Oxford and \"supervisions\" at Cambridge\n* College staircases in Oxford are typically numbered whereas those in Cambridge are assigned letters or double letters when there are more than 26 staircases in a given college.\n\nIt is still compulsory at Oxford to wear formal academic dress ([[sub fusc]]) for all university examinations, although this is not the case at Cambridge. During Hilary Term 2006, the students of Oxford voted 81% in favour of keeping formal academic dress at university exams.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article737217.ece|title=21st-century students vote to keep Oxford tradition|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=4 March 2006|accessdate=6 May 2010 | location=London | first=Patrick | last=Foster}}</ref> In general, however, traditions and the seriousness with which they are taken tend to vary widely amongst the different colleges within each university, showing more variation than between the two universities as a whole.\n\n===Admission of women===\nFor most of their history, only men were permitted to study at and receive degrees from Oxford and Cambridge. Starting in the late 19th century, both universities saw the establishment of residential colleges exclusively for women students: [[Girton College, Cambridge]], was founded in 1869 and [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford]], in 1878. Although Cambridge was the first to accommodate female students, women were not permitted to become full members of the university until 1947, whereas at Oxford this had occurred in 1920.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/oxbridge/features/educating-women|title=Educating Women \u2013 Oxbridge|accessdate=6 May 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726081358/http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/oxbridge/features/educating-women|archivedate=26 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/about_the_university/introducing_oxford/women_at_oxford/index.html|title=Women at Oxford|publisher=Oxford University|accessdate=6 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nThere are still three colleges at Cambridge which only accept women: [[Newnham College, Cambridge|Newnham]], [[Murray Edwards College, Cambridge|Murray Edwards]] and [[Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge|Lucy Cavendish]]. In 2008, Oxford's last all-female college, [[St Hilda's College, Oxford|St Hilda's]], admitted men and became coeducational.\n\n== The \"Oxford for humanities, Cambridge for sciences\" belief ==\nThere is a common impression that Oxford is stronger in politics and the [[humanities]], while Cambridge is stronger in the sciences and engineering. Despite both universities' stressing that there is no significant difference between them in either the sciences or humanities today,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate_courses/working_with_schools_and_colleges/information_for_teachers_and_advisers/oxford_and_cambridge.html|title=Oxford and Cambridge: the similarities and differences|publisher=Oxford University|accessdate=6 May 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100928002638/http://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate_courses/working_with_schools_and_colleges/information_for_teachers_and_advisers/oxford_and_cambridge.html|archivedate=28 September 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/teachers/oxfordandcambridge/|title=Oxford and Cambridge: the similarities and differences|publisher=Cambridge University|accessdate=6 May 2010}}</ref> this disparity in the popular imagination has existed since at least the late 1820s, when ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper reported on the appointment of Oxford and Cambridge academics to the newly established professorships of [[University College London]]: \"it is known to be the intention to choose [[classics|classical]] professors at Oxford, and mathematical at Cambridge\", although in the event both the classical and mathematical professors were eventually chosen from Cambridge.<ref name=\"Oxford University\">{{cite web|url=http://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/about/oxford-figures/ch1-11|title=Oxford Figures: The tradition of rivalry with Cambridge|publisher=Oxford University|date=17 September 2007|accessdate=4 May 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609173216/http://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/about/oxford-figures/ch1-11|archivedate=9 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn his book, ''The Decline of Privilege: The Modernization of Oxford University'',<ref name=soares>{{Citation\n |last         = Soares\n |first        = Joseph\n |title        = The Decline of Privilege: The Modernization of Oxford University\n |publisher    = Stanford University Press\n |year         = 1999\n |url          = http://www.sup.org/book.cgi?id=981\n |accessdate   = 6 May 2010\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100718135413/http://www.sup.org/book.cgi?id=981\n |archive-date = 18 July 2010\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref> Joseph A. Soares, an American [[sociologist]], suggests that Oxford developed a superior political and literary reputation because of its unparalleled connections to England's governing class, its status as the oldest and most traditional university in England, and the greater romantic appeal of Oxford to writers:\n\n{{quote|...in [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|British cabinets]] in the twentieth century, Oxford men and women outnumbered Cambridge graduates nearly two to one ... Of eleven prime ministers counting back from [[Tony Blair]], eight were undergraduates at Oxford, and none were at Cambridge ... Oxford has been second to none as a gatekeeper to the political elite...\n\nAcademics and novelists have viewed Oxford as the quintessential English university  ... authors who portray universities in their novels, as Ian Carter's definitive study of British university fiction since 1945 demonstrated, have been attracted to Oxford by a huge majority. Of the 204 novels written between 1945 and 1988 that featured British academic life, 119 depicted Oxford; Cambridge, with 26 appearances, came in a distant second place ... Carter showed that fictional Oxford signified those values thought to epitomize English society: [[toleration|tolerance]], [[civic virtue|civility]], [[cultural pluralism|pluralism]], and democracy ... To judge from novels on academic life, one would surmise that England's soul dwelled in Oxford.\n\nBecause of its relation to the power elite and its hold on the [[middle class|middle-class]] imagination, Oxford often provided the mental landscape for national self-examination ...\n\n[A] major charge against Oxford was that ... it was anti-science and unconcerned with contributing to economic growth. As we shall see ... there was substance to this criticism before [[World War II]], but there has not been since then.\n}}\n\nDespite Oxford University having been the home of almost 60 Nobel prize winners, Cambridge has been associated with an even larger number of Nobel Prize-winning breakthroughs (ca. 90) and a greater fraction of Britain's most culturally significant scientists, including [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Isaac Newton]]. The authors of ''Oxford Figures''<ref name=\"Oxford University\"/> also suggest that Cambridge's unrivalled intellectual reputation in England, especially although not exclusively in technical fields, could be partly attributed to the emphasis it placed on mathematics for many years:\n\n{{quote|Cambridge developed, from the mid-eighteenth century onwards, a highly competitive examination culture geared towards ranking students on a [[Mathematical Tripos|mathematical examination]], after prolonged coaching. Furthermore ... no student could go on to [study [[classics]] unless they had already done well in mathematics]. This system produced ... many of the best mathematicians and scientists of the nineteenth century, as well as some of the best lawyers, clergymen, and other [[profession]]als...\n\nAlthough the Cambridge system in its most competitive form was dropped in the early twentieth century ... [the effect it had on the quality of Oxford applicants] can be seen in the rueful reflections in 1912 of Arthur Joliffe, Fellow and tutor at [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford|Corpus Christi College]] from 1891 to 1920, upon the evidence presented by candidates for Oxford entrance scholarships:\n\n''it is undeniable that the average candidate [at Oxford] is not as good as the average candidate at Cambridge. The genius from the small [[grammar school]], the promising student from a provincial university, the ablest boy at the large [[Public School (UK)|public school]], all are sent to Cambridge in preference to Oxford as a rule. Some of the candidates sent to Oxford from large public schools are occasionally so bad that one can only suppose that their masters think that a willingness to come to Oxford is a sufficient qualification for a Mathematical Scholarship there.''\n}}\n\nNotwithstanding the above, significant changes have occurred at both Oxford and Cambridge over the last century, including Cambridge's diversification away from intense mathematical study and Oxford's renewed emphasis on ground-breaking scientific research, such as its influential work in the development of [[penicillin]]. Oxford offers the course of [[Philosophy, Politics, and Economics]], while Cambridge offers [[Human, Social and Political Sciences]]. Software tycoon [[Bill Gates]] gives [[Gates Scholarship|scholarships to Cambridge]], while Oxford is home to what is the oldest and arguably the most prestigious academic award for graduates, the [[Rhodes Scholarship]] instituted by [[Cecil Rhodes]]. [[US News and World Report]] rankings support this stereotype; Cambridge tends to rank higher in the sciences, and Oxford in the humanities.\n\n==Undergraduate admissions criteria==\nEntrance to Oxford and Cambridge is academically competitive. According to the 2011 Universities Guide from ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper, the five top universities in the UK based on undergraduate students' performance in public examinations while at high school (as measured on the [[UCAS Tariff|UCAS tariff scale]]) were Cambridge (546), Oxford (530), [[Imperial College London]] (500), the [[London School of Economics]] (493) and [[Durham University]] (466).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/table/2010/jun/04/university-league-table|title=University guide 2011: University league table|date=8 June 2010|newspaper=The Guardian | location=London}}</ref> Depending on which subject an applicant wishes to specialise in, there are often compulsory subject-specific entrance tests as well.\n\nAfter an initial [[wikt:screening|screening]] of submitted applications, [[short list|short-listed]] candidates at Oxford and Cambridge are invited to a series of tests and interviews with the academics who may eventually be teaching them. Oxbridge interviews have acquired something of a mythical status in the British media, becoming a source of various humorous anecdotes and [[urban legend]]s due to the perception that the interviews themselves are bizarre, intimidating and/or frequently involve unusual questions and requests. Interview prompts reportedly used in the past include \"''Do you think you're clever?''\" (from a Law interview at Cambridge)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brightknowledge.org/projects/bright-knowledge/null,1113,AR.html|title=Top 10 strangest interview questions|publisher=Bright Knowledge}}</ref> and \"''Talk about a [[light bulb]]''\" (from an Engineering interview at Oxford).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesonline.typepad.com/schoolgate/2008/11/would-you-rathe.html|title=Would you rather be a novel or a poem?

Candidates are also expected to show a willingness to challenge their own [[prejudice|preconceptions]] about the topics under discussion, as well as the preconceptions adopted by their interviewers. This is essentially a test of whether the student would do well under the tutorial/supervision system at Oxford and Cambridge, and a poor performance at interview may negate an otherwise strong application.\n\nIn recent years, Cambridge has placed slightly more emphasis than Oxford on public exam results during the selection process. Cambridge routinely asks applicants who take A-level exams to report their exact scores, not just letter-grades;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.homerton.cam.ac.uk/admissions/Requirements.html|title=Homerton College Cambridge: Undergraduate Entry Requirements|publisher=Homerton.cam.ac.uk|accessdate=2015-07-29|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502233550/http://www.homerton.cam.ac.uk/admissions/Requirements.html|archivedate=2 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> this is partly to distinguish between high A-grades and borderline A/B grades. In contrast, disclosure of exact scores for Oxford applications is voluntary. In 2010, the new A* grade for A-level exams (an A* indicating a high A) was introduced. Cambridge started requesting that its applicants achieve at least one A* grade if they were taking A-levels, letting students earn a place through their performance in public examinations; Oxford initially stated that it relies more on its own internal aptitude tests and waited to see how effective the A* grade is at highlighting the best candidates, before deciding to implement it as a requirement for most courses starting in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate_courses/finding_out_more/frequently_asked.html|title=Frequently Asked Questions: Will I need A* grades to get in to Oxford?|publisher=University of Oxford|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830223243/http://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate_courses/finding_out_more/frequently_asked.html|archivedate=30 August 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nDue to the similarities between the two universities, and to ease the burden of interviewing so many applicants each year, secondary school students are not normally allowed to apply to both Oxford and Cambridge in the same application cycle.

Cambridge currently lead the series 16\u201314, with one draw in 1994.\n\nThe Boat Race and the two Varsity Matches are notable in the UK in that they are the only university sports events that have any public profile outside the universities themselves; all three are screened live on national television and are widely covered in the national media.\n\nAll other significant sports have their own [[varsity match]] at some point during the year; some of these, such as [[the University Match (cricket)|the cricket fixture]], the [[Ice Hockey Varsity Match]] and the [[The Varsity Polo Match|Varsity Polo Match]] have attracted significant attention in the past. The results of all the varsity matches in The Varsity Games are aggregated and each year one university wins the Varsity Games title. Sportsmen who have competed at a Varsity Match in the prestigious Full Blue sports are eligible for an [[Oxford Blue]] or [[Cambridge Blue]] respectively.\n\n==University rankings==\nOver the last few years, [[Universities in the United Kingdom|British universities]] have been subjected to the increasing popularity of [[League tables of British Universities|national university league tables]], which rank universities based on criteria such as their student-staff ratio, drop-out rates and spending on services and facilities. Oxford and Cambridge have been a constant presence at the top end of the tables, never appearing outside the overall top three and rarely not holding the first and second places, but their dominance in individual subjects has been challenged by other institutions.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/universityguide|title=Guardian university guide|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=6 May 2010 | location=London | date=10 February 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://extras.timesonline.co.uk/tol_gug/gooduniversityguide.php|title=Times University Rankings League Table 2010|newspaper=[[The Times]]|accessdate=6 May 2010 | location=London | first=Roland | last=Watson}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2012, Cambridge has been ranked above Oxford in three out of the four major UK university league tables.

Most Oxford colleges have a [[List of Oxbridge sister colleges|sister college]] in Cambridge. Some Oxford and Cambridge colleges with the same name are 'sisters': for example, [[Jesus College, Cambridge]], and [[Jesus College, Oxford]]. However, namesakes are not always paired up: for example, [[St John's College, Oxford]], is the sister college of [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge]], while [[St John's College, Cambridge]], is the sister college of [[Balliol College, Oxford]]. Arrangements between sister colleges vary, but may include reciprocal offers of accommodation to students from the other university when they are visiting. Furthermore, a significant proportion of academic staff has at some point been a member of the \"other place\".\n\nConcerns are often raised that Oxford and Cambridge do not project a socially inclusive image to potential applicants from [[state school]]s, and thus Oxbridge students are disproportionately from wealthy backgrounds.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7180898.stm|title=Teachers' Oxbridge misconceptions|work=BBC News|date=11 January 2008|accessdate=6 May 2010}}</ref> The two universities have made individual and combined efforts in recent years to promote themselves to potential applicants from disadvantaged backgrounds.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1953589/Cambridge-drops-foreign-language-rule-for-applicants.html|title=Cambridge drops foreign language rule for applicants|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=14 May 2008|accessdate=6 May 2010 | location=London | first=Graeme | last=Paton}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article4027010.ece|title=Oxford attempts to woo state school pupils through their teachers|newspaper=The Times|date=29 May 2008|accessdate=6 May 2010 | location=London | first=Alexandra | last=Frean}}</ref> Each year, the Universities spend around \u00a38 million on access schemes and there is a designated Access Officer in every [[Common Room (university)|JCR]] and students' union.\n\n==See also==\n* [[College rivalry]]\n* [[Golden triangle (universities)]]\n* [[King's College London\u2013UCL rivalry]]\n* [[The London Varsity]]\n* [[Russell Group]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.cam.ac.uk/ University of Cambridge]\n* [http://www.ox.ac.uk/ University of Oxford]\n* [http://www.theboatrace.org/ The Boat Race]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928001629/http://www.curufc.com/fixturesandresults_thevarsitymatch.php The Varsity Match]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20141223025234/http://www.regionalconferences.org.uk/ Oxbridge Student Conferences]\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/sports/ncaabasketball/01varsity.html?_r=1 Oxford Journal \u2014 It's Not Duke-North Carolina, but Oxford-Cambridge Is Unrivaled], ''[[New York Times]]''\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Oxbridge Rivalry}}\n[[Category:Oxbridge]]\n[[Category:Culture of the University of Oxford]]\n[[Category:Culture of the University of Cambridge]]\n[[Category:English culture]]\n[[Category:Academic culture]]\n[[Category:Rivalry]]\n\n[[zh:\u725b\u6865]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Rivalry between the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2014}}\n\n'''Rivalry between the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge''' is a phenomenon going back many centuries. During most of that time, they were the only two universities in [[England and Wales]], making the rivalry more intense than it is now.\n\nThe [[University of Oxford]] and the [[University of Cambridge]], sometimes collectively known as ''[[Oxbridge]]'', are the two [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation|oldest]] universities in England. Both were founded more than 800 years ago, and between them they have produced a large number of Britain's most prominent scientists, writers and politicians, as well as noted figures in many other fields. Yet for many of these centuries the two universities were unrecognisable as universities in the modern sense, as they were largely institutions for producing clergymen and were thus strongly tied to the Church. Competition between Oxford and Cambridge also has a long history, dating back to around 1208 when Cambridge was founded by scholars taking refuge from hostile townsmen in Oxford.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/univ/history/records.html |title=Early records &#124; University of Cambridge |publisher=Cam.ac.uk |date=2013-01-28 |accessdate=2015-07-29}}</ref>\n\n==Similarities between Oxford and Cambridge==\n[[Image:KingsCollegeChapelWest.jpg|300px|right|thumb|The chapel of [[King's College, Cambridge]]: the most famous symbol of both the city and the university]]\n\n===Academic reputation===\nIn 2012 the Times Higher Education World Reputation Rankings, based on a survey of 13,388 academics over 131 countries which was then the largest evaluation of academic reputation to date<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/mar/10/world-top-100-universities-reputation-rankings-reputation-times-higher-education | title=World's top 100 universities 2011: their reputations ranked by Times Higher Education | newspaper= Guardian | accessdate=26 March 2011 | location=UK | first=Ami | last=Sedghi | date=10 March 2011}}</ref> found that both Cambridge and Oxford belonged to the elite group of six universities touted as the 'globally recognized super brands';<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2010-2011/reputation-rankings.html|title=Top Universities by Reputation 2011|magazine=Times Higher Education|accessdate=26 March 2011|location=UK|date=10 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine | url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2010-2011/reputation-analysis.html | title=Six 'super brands': their reputations precede them | magazine= Times Higher Education | accessdate=26 March 2011 | location=UK | date=10 March 2011}}</ref> The other four were [[Harvard University]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and [[Stanford University]].\n\n===Institutions and facilities===\nOxford and Cambridge both have:\n* well-regarded publishing houses ([[Oxford University Press]] and [[Cambridge University Press]])\n* [[botanical garden]]s ([[University of Oxford Botanic Garden]] and [[Cambridge University Botanic Garden]])\n* museums (the [[Ashmolean Museum|Ashmolean]] and the [[Fitzwilliam Museum|Fitzwilliam]])\n* [[legal deposit|legal deposit libraries]] (the [[Bodleian Library|Bodleian]] and the [[Cambridge University Library]])\n* [[debate|debating]] societies (the [[Oxford Union]] and the [[Cambridge Union]])\n* [[business school]]s (the [[Sa\u00efd Business School]] and the [[Judge Business School]])\n* [[science park]]s ([[Oxford Science Park]] and [[Cambridge Science Park]])\n* theatrical societies and groups (the [[Oxford University Dramatic Society]], [[The Oxford Imps]] and [[The Oxford Revue]]; the [[Footlights|Cambridge Footlights]], The [[Cambridge University Amateur Dramatic Club]] and the [[Marlowe Society]])\n\n===Collegiate structure===\nOxford and Cambridge also share a common [[Collegiate university|collegiate structure]]: each university has more than 30 semi-autonomous residential colleges (see [[Colleges of the University of Cambridge]], [[Colleges of the University of Oxford]]), which provide the environments in which students live, work and sleep.\n\nApplicants must choose a specific college when applying to Oxford or Cambridge, or allow the university to select one for them, as every undergraduate and graduate student must be a member of one of the colleges.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/colleges/choosing_a_college/index.html|title=Choosing a college|publisher=Oxford University|accessdate=6 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/colleges/|title=The Colleges|publisher=Cambridge University|accessdate=6 May 2010}}</ref> However, all colleges are part of the university and students studying the same subject attend the same lectures and exams, irrespective of which college they belong. Degrees are also awarded by the central university and not by the individual colleges.\n\nColleges within each university regularly compete with each other in a variety of sporting and other events (e.g. [[Rugby union|rugby]], [[Sport rowing|rowing]], athletics and [[chess]]), but will pool their talent to form university teams for inter-university contests.\n\n===Teaching method===\nThe principal method of undergraduate teaching (other than lectures) is the [[Tutorial|\"supervision\" or \"tutorial\"]]: terms used at Cambridge and Oxford respectively, though the meaning is the same. These are typically weekly or more frequent hour-long sessions in which small groups of students \u2013 usually between one and three \u2013 meet with a member of the university's teaching staff or a doctoral student. Students are normally required to complete an essay or assignment in advance of the supervision/tutorial, which they will discuss with the supervisor/tutor during the session, along with any concerns or difficulties they have had with the material presented in that week's lectures. Students typically receive one to four tutorials/supervisions per week.<ref>[http://www.quns.cam.ac.uk/imagedisplay.asp?I_ID=54 ]{{dead link|date=July 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Neighbouring universities and other institutions===\nWithin the cities of Oxford and Cambridge are campuses of other universities, respectively [[Oxford Brookes University]] and [[Anglia Ruskin University]]. In addition, various [[English language learning and teaching|English language schools]], secretarial and other non-university colleges are based in the two cities.\n\n===Production of educational materials===\nBoth Oxford and Cambridge have lent their names to educational materials and institutions associated with the two universities. In addition to their printing houses, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' is a prominent English-language dictionary worldwide, while [[Cambridge Assessment]] provides a number of widely recognised qualifications for students (including [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSEs]], [[GCE Advanced Level|A-levels]] and English-language proficiency certificates such as the [[Certificate in Advanced English]]).\n\n==Differences between Oxford and Cambridge==\n\n===The cities===\nThe city of [[Oxford]] is larger (having a population about 30 per cent greater than Cambridge's in 2007)<ref>[http://www.cambridge.gov.uk/ccm/content/policy-and-projects/population-statistics.en;jsessionid=AE884228F26AB5D190C5211EE4C8CC12]{{dead link|date=October 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>[http://www.oxford.gov.uk/community/popnstats.cfm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412023335/http://www.oxford.gov.uk/community/popnstats.cfm |date=12 April 2009 }}</ref> and has historically been more urban and industrial, whilst [[Cambridge]] more closely resembles an agricultural [[market town]]. Oxford is associated with the motor industry ([[BMW]] currently produce the [[Mini (BMW)|Mini]] in Oxford, and several [[Formula One]] teams are based in [[Oxfordshire]] and neighbouring counties), whereas the area surrounding Cambridge is known as [[Silicon Fen]]\u2014one of the most important technology centres in Europe\u2014that has presence of large companies like [[Microsoft]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], [[ARM architecture|ARM]], along with many medical technology firms.\n\nBoth cities were built near rivers. However, the sole river is more prominent in Cambridge, flowing through the city centre rather than the two rivers ([[River Thames|Thames]] and [[River Cherwell|Cherwell]]) which flow around the centre of Oxford. [[punt (boat)|Punting]] is especially popular in Cambridge along the famous stretch called 'The Backs', which features a number of bridges and 'the backs' of several colleges that abut the [[River Cam]] (punting is also popular at Oxford).\n\nDespite many ancient buildings in both Oxford and Cambridge, there are also distinct differences in architecture. Oxford has a uniformity of building material, as a large proportion of the buildings are in the local sandstone. Cambridge, on the other hand, has little local stone, so the building material has been brought in from many different sources, resulting in a greater variety of character. The contrasts in architecture in Cambridge are more pronounced, as can be seen when comparing [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]] with the neighbouring [[Senate House (University of Cambridge)|Senate House]].\n\nOxford is featured more often in literature and [[film|the cinema]]; films with scenes shot in Oxford include [[Shadowlands (1985 film)|Shadowlands]] and the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' movies, while Radcliffe Square was used in the filming of ''[[His Dark Materials: Northern Lights]]''. The television series ''[[Inspector Morse (TV series)|Inspector Morse]]'' and ''[[Lewis (TV series)|Lewis]]'' are also set in Oxford. Cambridge may be best known in film as the real-life location of the court race scene portrayed in the film [[Chariots of Fire]] (although the scene was filmed at [[Eton College]] instead), or for the television series [[Porterhouse Blue]].\n\n===Tradition===\nThere are differences in the terminology traditionally used at the two universities. For example:\n* At Oxford, the three terms of the academic year are called [[Michaelmas term|Michaelmas]], [[Hilary term|Hilary]] and [[Trinity term|Trinity]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/about_the_university/university_year/dates_of_term.html |title=Dates of Term &#124; University of Oxford |publisher=Ox.ac.uk |date=2015-06-24 |accessdate=2015-07-29}}</ref> whereas at Cambridge they are Michaelmas, [[Lent term|Lent]] and [[Easter term|Easter]] (the Easter term is sometimes called \"Exam term\").<ref>[http://www.cam.ac.uk/univ/termdates.html Term dates], University of Cambridge</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cusu.cam.ac.uk/academic/exams/examinfo.pdf |title=Tips for Help in Exam Term |publisher=Cambridge University Students' Union |format=PDF |accessdate=5 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606012650/http://www.cusu.cam.ac.uk/academic/exams/examinfo.pdf |archive-date=6 June 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>Constitution of the Churchill College Junior Common Room</ref>\n* The large enclosed squares of grass found in most colleges are referred to as \"courts\" in Cambridge and \"quadrangles\" (or \"quads\") in Oxford.\n* College cleaners in the two Universities go by different names: in Oxford they are 'scouts' and in Cambridge they are '[[bedder]]s'.<ref>Frank Stubbings, ''Bedders, Bulldogs and Bedells: a Cambridge Glossary,'' {{ISBN|0-521-47978-9}}</ref>\n* A Doctor of Philosophy degree is referred to as a \"Ph.D.\" in Cambridge and a \"D.Phil.\" at Oxford.<ref>[http://web2.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/prospective/dphil/]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224152702/http://web2.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/prospective/dphil/ |date=24 February 2009 }}</ref>\n* The regular teaching meetings between student and tutor are called [[Tutorial|\"tutorials\"]] at Oxford and \"supervisions\" at Cambridge\n* College staircases in Oxford are typically numbered whereas those in Cambridge are assigned letters or double letters when there are more than 26 staircases in a given college.\n\nIt is still compulsory at Oxford to wear formal academic dress ([[sub fusc]]) for all university examinations, although this is not the case at Cambridge.

Starting in the late 19th century, both universities saw the establishment of residential colleges exclusively for women students: [[Girton College, Cambridge]], was founded in 1869 and [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford]], in 1878. Although Cambridge was the first to accommodate female students, women were not permitted to become full members of the university until 1947, whereas at Oxford this had occurred in 1920.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/oxbridge/features/educating-women|title=Educating Women \u2013 Oxbridge|accessdate=6 May 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726081358/http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/oxbridge/features/educating-women|archivedate=26 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/about_the_university/introducing_oxford/women_at_oxford/index.html|title=Women at Oxford|publisher=Oxford University|accessdate=6 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nThere are still three colleges at Cambridge which only accept women: [[Newnham College, Cambridge|Newnham]], [[Murray Edwards College, Cambridge|Murray Edwards]] and [[Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge|Lucy Cavendish]].

Despite both universities' stressing that there is no significant difference between them in either the sciences or humanities today,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate_courses/working_with_schools_and_colleges/information_for_teachers_and_advisers/oxford_and_cambridge.html|title=Oxford and Cambridge: the similarities and differences|publisher=Oxford University|accessdate=6 May 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100928002638/http://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate_courses/working_with_schools_and_colleges/information_for_teachers_and_advisers/oxford_and_cambridge.html|archivedate=28 September 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/teachers/oxfordandcambridge/|title=Oxford and Cambridge: the similarities and differences|publisher=Cambridge University|accessdate=6 May 2010}}</ref> this disparity in the popular imagination has existed since at least the late 1820s, when ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper reported on the appointment of Oxford and Cambridge academics to the newly established professorships of [[University College London]]: \"it is known to be the intention to choose [[classics|classical]] professors at Oxford, and mathematical at Cambridge\", although in the event both the classical and mathematical professors were eventually chosen from Cambridge.<ref name=\"Oxford University\">{{cite web|url=http://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/about/oxford-figures/ch1-11|title=Oxford Figures: The tradition of rivalry with Cambridge|publisher=Oxford University|date=17 September 2007|accessdate=4 May 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609173216/http://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/about/oxford-figures/ch1-11|archivedate=9 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn his book, ''The Decline of Privilege: The Modernization of Oxford University'',<ref name=soares>{{Citation\n |last         = Soares\n |first        = Joseph\n |title        = The Decline of Privilege: The Modernization of Oxford University\n |publisher    = Stanford University Press\n |year         = 1999\n |url          = http://www.sup.org/book.cgi?id=981\n |accessdate   = 6 May 2010\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100718135413/http://www.sup.org/book.cgi?id=981\n |archive-date = 18 July 2010\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref> Joseph A. Soares, an American [[sociologist]], suggests that Oxford developed a superior political and literary reputation because of its unparalleled connections to England's governing class, its status as the oldest and most traditional university in England, and the greater romantic appeal of Oxford to writers:\n\n{{quote|...in [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|British cabinets]] in the twentieth century, Oxford men and women outnumbered Cambridge graduates nearly two to one ... Of eleven prime ministers counting back from [[Tony Blair]], eight were undergraduates at Oxford, and none were at Cambridge ... Oxford has been second to none as a gatekeeper to the political elite...\n\nAcademics and novelists have viewed Oxford as the quintessential English university  ... authors who portray universities in their novels, as Ian Carter's definitive study of British university fiction since 1945 demonstrated, have been attracted to Oxford by a huge majority. Of the 204 novels written between 1945 and 1988 that featured British academic life, 119 depicted Oxford; Cambridge, with 26 appearances, came in a distant second place ... Carter showed that fictional Oxford signified those values thought to epitomize English society: [[toleration|tolerance]], [[civic virtue|civility]], [[cultural pluralism|pluralism]], and democracy ... To judge from novels on academic life, one would surmise that England's soul dwelled in Oxford.\n\nBecause of its relation to the power elite and its hold on the [[middle class|middle-class]] imagination, Oxford often provided the mental landscape for national self-examination ...\n\n[A] major charge against Oxford was that ... it was anti-science and unconcerned with contributing to economic growth. As we shall see ... there was substance to this criticism before [[World War II]], but there has not been since then.\n}}\n\nDespite Oxford University having been the home of almost 60 Nobel prize winners, Cambridge has been associated with an even larger number of Nobel Prize-winning breakthroughs (ca. 90) and a greater fraction of Britain's most culturally significant scientists, including [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Isaac Newton]]. The authors of ''Oxford Figures''<ref name=\"Oxford University\"/> also suggest that Cambridge's unrivalled intellectual reputation in England, especially although not exclusively in technical fields, could be partly attributed to the emphasis it placed on mathematics for many years:\n\n{{quote|Cambridge developed, from the mid-eighteenth century onwards, a highly competitive examination culture geared towards ranking students on a [[Mathematical Tripos|mathematical examination]], after prolonged coaching. Furthermore ... no student could go on to [study [[classics]] unless they had already done well in mathematics]. This system produced ... many of the best mathematicians and scientists of the nineteenth century, as well as some of the best lawyers, clergymen, and other [[profession]]als...\n\nAlthough the Cambridge system in its most competitive form was dropped in the early twentieth century ... [the effect it had on the quality of Oxford applicants] can be seen in the rueful reflections in 1912 of Arthur Joliffe, Fellow and tutor at [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford|Corpus Christi College]] from 1891 to 1920, upon the evidence presented by candidates for Oxford entrance scholarships:\n\n''it is undeniable that the average candidate [at Oxford] is not as good as the average candidate at Cambridge. The genius from the small [[grammar school]], the promising student from a provincial university, the ablest boy at the large [[Public School (UK)|public school]], all are sent to Cambridge in preference to Oxford as a rule. Some of the candidates sent to Oxford from large public schools are occasionally so bad that one can only suppose that their masters think that a willingness to come to Oxford is a sufficient qualification for a Mathematical Scholarship there.''\n}}\n\nNotwithstanding the above, significant changes have occurred at both Oxford and Cambridge over the last century, including Cambridge's diversification away from intense mathematical study and Oxford's renewed emphasis on ground-breaking scientific research, such as its influential work in the development of [[penicillin]]. Oxford offers the course of [[Philosophy, Politics, and Economics]], while Cambridge offers [[Human, Social and Political Sciences]]. Software tycoon [[Bill Gates]] gives [[Gates Scholarship|scholarships to Cambridge]], while Oxford is home to what is the oldest and arguably the most prestigious academic award for graduates, the [[Rhodes Scholarship]] instituted by [[Cecil Rhodes]]. [[US News and World Report]] rankings support this stereotype; Cambridge tends to rank higher in the sciences, and Oxford in the humanities.\n\n==Undergraduate admissions criteria==\nEntrance to Oxford and Cambridge is academically competitive. According to the 2011 Universities Guide from ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper, the five top universities in the UK based on undergraduate students' performance in public examinations while at high school (as measured on the [[UCAS Tariff|UCAS tariff scale]]) were Cambridge (546), Oxford (530), [[Imperial College London]] (500), the [[London School of Economics]] (493) and [[Durham University]] (466).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/table/2010/jun/04/university-league-table|title=University guide 2011: University league table|date=8 June 2010|newspaper=The Guardian | location=London}}</ref> Depending on which subject an applicant wishes to specialise in, there are often compulsory subject-specific entrance tests as well.\n\nAfter an initial [[wikt:screening|screening]] of submitted applications, [[short list|short-listed]] candidates at Oxford and Cambridge are invited to a series of tests and interviews with the academics who may eventually be teaching them. Oxbridge interviews have acquired something of a mythical status in the British media, becoming a source of various humorous anecdotes and [[urban legend]]s due to the perception that the interviews themselves are bizarre, intimidating and/or frequently involve unusual questions and requests. Interview prompts reportedly used in the past include \"''Do you think you're clever?''\" (from a Law interview at Cambridge)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brightknowledge.org/projects/bright-knowledge/null,1113,AR.html|title=Top 10 strangest interview questions|publisher=Bright Knowledge}}</ref> and \"''Talk about a [[light bulb]]''\" (from an Engineering interview at Oxford).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesonline.typepad.com/schoolgate/2008/11/would-you-rathe.html|title=Would you rather be a novel or a poem?

Candidates are also expected to show a willingness to challenge their own [[prejudice|preconceptions]] about the topics under discussion, as well as the preconceptions adopted by their interviewers. This is essentially a test of whether the student would do well under the tutorial/supervision system at Oxford and Cambridge, and a poor performance at interview may negate an otherwise strong application.\n\nIn recent years, Cambridge has placed slightly more emphasis than Oxford on public exam results during the selection process. Cambridge routinely asks applicants who take A-level exams to report their exact scores, not just letter-grades;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.homerton.cam.ac.uk/admissions/Requirements.html|title=Homerton College Cambridge: Undergraduate Entry Requirements|publisher=Homerton.cam.ac.uk|accessdate=2015-07-29|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502233550/http://www.homerton.cam.ac.uk/admissions/Requirements.html|archivedate=2 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> this is partly to distinguish between high A-grades and borderline A/B grades. In contrast, disclosure of exact scores for Oxford applications is voluntary. In 2010, the new A* grade for A-level exams (an A* indicating a high A) was introduced. Cambridge started requesting that its applicants achieve at least one A* grade if they were taking A-levels, letting students earn a place through their performance in public examinations; Oxford initially stated that it relies more on its own internal aptitude tests and waited to see how effective the A* grade is at highlighting the best candidates, before deciding to implement it as a requirement for most courses starting in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate_courses/finding_out_more/frequently_asked.html|title=Frequently Asked Questions: Will I need A* grades to get in to Oxford?|publisher=University of Oxford|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830223243/http://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate_courses/finding_out_more/frequently_asked.html|archivedate=30 August 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nDue to the similarities between the two universities, and to ease the burden of interviewing so many applicants each year, secondary school students are not normally allowed to apply to both Oxford and Cambridge in the same application cycle.

Cambridge currently lead the series 16\u201314, with one draw in 1994.\n\nThe Boat Race and the two Varsity Matches are notable in the UK in that they are the only university sports events that have any public profile outside the universities themselves; all three are screened live on national television and are widely covered in the national media.\n\nAll other significant sports have their own [[varsity match]] at some point during the year; some of these, such as [[the University Match (cricket)|the cricket fixture]], the [[Ice Hockey Varsity Match]] and the [[The Varsity Polo Match|Varsity Polo Match]] have attracted significant attention in the past. The results of all the varsity matches in The Varsity Games are aggregated and each year one university wins the Varsity Games title. Sportsmen who have competed at a Varsity Match in the prestigious Full Blue sports are eligible for an [[Oxford Blue]] or [[Cambridge Blue]] respectively.\n\n==University rankings==\nOver the last few years, [[Universities in the United Kingdom|British universities]] have been subjected to the increasing popularity of [[League tables of British Universities|national university league tables]], which rank universities based on criteria such as their student-staff ratio, drop-out rates and spending on services and facilities. Oxford and Cambridge have been a constant presence at the top end of the tables, never appearing outside the overall top three and rarely not holding the first and second places, but their dominance in individual subjects has been challenged by other institutions.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/universityguide|title=Guardian university guide|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=6 May 2010 | location=London | date=10 February 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://extras.timesonline.co.uk/tol_gug/gooduniversityguide.php|title=Times University Rankings League Table 2010|newspaper=[[The Times]]|accessdate=6 May 2010 | location=London | first=Roland | last=Watson}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2012, Cambridge has been ranked above Oxford in three out of the four major UK university league tables.

Most Oxford colleges have a [[List of Oxbridge sister colleges|sister college]] in Cambridge. Some Oxford and Cambridge colleges with the same name are 'sisters': for example, [[Jesus College, Cambridge]], and [[Jesus College, Oxford]]. However, namesakes are not always paired up: for example, [[St John's College, Oxford]], is the sister college of [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge]], while [[St John's College, Cambridge]], is the sister college of [[Balliol College, Oxford]]. Arrangements between sister colleges vary, but may include reciprocal offers of accommodation to students from the other university when they are visiting. Furthermore, a significant proportion of academic staff has at some point been a member of the \"other place\".\n\nConcerns are often raised that Oxford and Cambridge do not project a socially inclusive image to potential applicants from [[state school]]s, and thus Oxbridge students are disproportionately from wealthy backgrounds.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7180898.stm|title=Teachers' Oxbridge misconceptions|work=BBC News|date=11 January 2008|accessdate=6 May 2010}}</ref> The two universities have made individual and combined efforts in recent years to promote themselves to potential applicants from disadvantaged backgrounds.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1953589/Cambridge-drops-foreign-language-rule-for-applicants.html|title=Cambridge drops foreign language rule for applicants|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=14 May 2008|accessdate=6 May 2010 | location=London | first=Graeme | last=Paton}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article4027010.ece|title=Oxford attempts to woo state school pupils through their teachers|newspaper=The Times|date=29 May 2008|accessdate=6 May 2010 | location=London | first=Alexandra | last=Frean}}</ref> Each year, the Universities spend around \u00a38 million on access schemes and there is a designated Access Officer in every [[Common Room (university)|JCR]] and students' union.\n\n==See also==\n* [[College rivalry]]\n* [[Golden triangle (universities)]]\n* [[King's College London\u2013UCL rivalry]]\n* [[The London Varsity]]\n* [[Russell Group]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.cam.ac.uk/ University of Cambridge]\n* [http://www.ox.ac.uk/ University of Oxford]\n* [http://www.theboatrace.org/ The Boat Race]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928001629/http://www.curufc.com/fixturesandresults_thevarsitymatch.php The Varsity Match]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20141223025234/http://www.regionalconferences.org.uk/ Oxbridge Student Conferences]\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/sports/ncaabasketball/01varsity.html?_r=1 Oxford Journal \u2014 It's Not Duke-North Carolina, but Oxford-Cambridge Is Unrivaled], ''[[New York Times]]''\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Oxbridge Rivalry}}\n[[Category:Oxbridge]]\n[[Category:Culture of the University of Oxford]]\n[[Category:Culture of the University of Cambridge]]\n[[Category:English culture]]\n[[Category:Academic culture]]\n[[Category:Rivalry]]\n\n[[zh:\u725b\u6865]]\n", "name_user": "Shadowssettle", "label": "safe", "comment": "unsourced claim weakened", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford%E2%80%93Cambridge_rivalry"}

The airtime resulted in the song being picked up by adult contemporary (AC) radio stations around the country. \"Standing Outside in the Rain\" began to climb the European pop charts, eventually peaking out at number three.\n\nIn 1990, Skipper co-produced Peter White's [http://www.peterwhite.com] first [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ig2bHQ0Gdg&feature=fvwp] album<ref>{{cite news |author=John Beaudin |title=Our First of Many Interviews With Peter White (2002)|publisher=SmoothJazzNow.com|date=July 26, 2002 |url=http://www.smoothjazznow.com/interviews/peter_white_2002.htm|accessdate=2011-05-11}}</ref> titled \"R\u00e9veillez-Vous.\" Upon its release, the album reached Number One on the NAC radio charts and Skipper sang the lone vocal track \"Play Your Guitar For Me\" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cgGK-js66s].\n\n''Play Your Guitar For Me'' became the follow-up single to \"Standing Outside in the Rain\" in Europe.\n\nFree of his obligations with Cypress Records in 1992, Skipper began working with Peter recording new material for his second solo album to be called \"Harry.\" One of the early sessions yielded the song \"I Want to Be With You\" written with Peter and released as a single on the Crisis record label in Europe.\n\nIn 1999, Sjaak De Bruijn, the head of A&R for Gold Circle Entertainment in Europe, released \"Walking on a Wire\" which included song selections from \"The Clock and the Moon,\" along with songs from the unreleased \"Harry\" album.\n\n===1994\u20131997 Colour Club===\n[[Image:Colour Club 2.jpg|thumb|Colour Club \u2013 Skipper Wise, Les Pierce]]\nIn 1994, Skipper was introduced to Les Pierce who had a Top 40 hit at the time with the pop group \"Louie Louie\" and was producing the vocal group, \"Take Six\".

The results yielded a video of the year nominations from The American Billboards Video awards.\n\nThe album \"In the Flow\" was released in 1996 on the JVC/VERTEX label. Now with a permanent singer Lisa Taylor, the album yielded three singles: \"Be Yourself\" which charted in the top 40 in Japan; \"If it's all Good\"and \"Pearls.\"\n\nThe third and final Colour Club record, \"Sexuality,\" was released in 1997 on JVC/Vertex and the single \"Tenderness\" was issued.

They are constructed to convey [[watercourse]]s across gaps such as valleys or ravines. The term ''aqueduct'' may also be used to refer to the [[Aqueduct (water supply)|entire watercourse]], as well as the bridge.<ref>\"aqueduct\", Britannica CD 2000</ref> Large [[navigable aqueduct]]s are used as transport links for [[boats]] or ships. Aqueducts must span a crossing at the same level as the watercourses on each end. The word is derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''{{lang|la|aqua}}'' (\"water\") and ''{{lang|la|ducere}}'' (\"to lead\").<ref>\"aqueduct\", Britannica CD 2000</ref> Therefore meaning \"to lead water\". A modern version of an '''aqueduct''' is a [[pipeline bridge]]. They may take the form of tunnels, networks of surface channels and canals, covered clay pipes or monumental bridges.\n\n==Ancient bridges for water==\n[[File:Mathur Hanging Trough Bridge.JPG|thumb|right|[[Mathur Aqueduct]], India]]\nAlthough particularly associated with the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], aqueducts were likely first used by the [[Minoans]] around 2000 BCE. The Minoans had developed what was then an extremely advanced [[irrigation system]], including several aqueducts.<ref>[http://www.ancient.eu/article/319/ Minoan Aqueducts: A Pioneering Technology], ''ancient.eu''</ref>\n\nIn the seventh century BCE, the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrians]] built an 80&nbsp;km long limestone aqueduct, which included a 10 m high section to cross a 300 m wide valley, to carry water to their capital city, [[Nineveh]].<ref>[http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/oip24.pdf Thorkild Jacobsen and Seton Lloyd, Sennacherib's Aqueduct at Jerwan, Oriental Institute Publication 24], [[University of Chicago Press]], 1935]</ref>\n\n===Roman Empire===\n{{Main|List of Roman bridges}}\n\nBridges were a distinctive feature of [[Roman aqueduct]]s which were built in all parts of the [[Roman Empire]], from Germany to Africa, and especially in the city of Rome, where they supplied water to public baths and for drinking. Roman aqueducts set a standard of engineering that was not surpassed for more than a thousand years.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n[[File:Hampi aqueduct.JPG|thumb|Ancient Indian aqueduct in [[Hampi]]]]\n\n==Modern aqueducts==\n\n===Navigable aqueducts===\n{{Main|Navigable aqueduct}}\nNavigable aqueducts, also called water bridges, are water-filled bridges to allow vessels on a [[waterway]] to cross ravines or valleys. During the [[Industrial Revolution]] of the 18th century, navigable aqueducts were constructed as part of the boom in canal-building. A notable revolving aqueduct has been made on the [[Bridgewater Canal]].

They are constructed to convey [[watercourse]]s across gaps such as valleys or ravines. The term ''aqueduct'' may also be used to refer to the [[Aqueduct (water supply)|entire watercourse]], as well as the bridge.<ref>\"aqueduct\", Britannica CD 2000</ref> Large [[navigable aqueduct]]s are used as transport links for [[boats]] or ships. Aqueducts must span a crossing at the same level as the watercourses on each end. The word is derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''{{lang|la|aqua}}'' (\"water\") and ''{{lang|la|ducere}}'' (\"to lead\").<ref>\"aqueduct\", Britannica CD 2000</ref> A modern version of an '''aqueduct''' is a [[pipeline bridge]]. They may take the form of tunnels, networks of surface channels and canals, covered clay pipes or monumental bridges.\n\n==Ancient bridges for water==\n[[File:Mathur Hanging Trough Bridge.JPG|thumb|right|[[Mathur Aqueduct]], India]]\nAlthough particularly associated with the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], aqueducts were likely first used by the [[Minoans]] around 2000 BCE. The Minoans had developed what was then an extremely advanced [[irrigation system]], including several aqueducts.<ref>[http://www.ancient.eu/article/319/ Minoan Aqueducts: A Pioneering Technology], ''ancient.eu''</ref>\n\nIn the seventh century BCE, the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrians]] built an 80&nbsp;km long limestone aqueduct, which included a 10 m high section to cross a 300 m wide valley, to carry water to their capital city, [[Nineveh]].<ref>[http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/oip24.pdf Thorkild Jacobsen and Seton Lloyd, Sennacherib's Aqueduct at Jerwan, Oriental Institute Publication 24], [[University of Chicago Press]], 1935]</ref>\n\n===Roman Empire===\n{{Main|List of Roman bridges}}\n\nBridges were a distinctive feature of [[Roman aqueduct]]s which were built in all parts of the [[Roman Empire]], from Germany to Africa, and especially in the city of Rome, where they supplied water to public baths and for drinking. Roman aqueducts set a standard of engineering that was not surpassed for more than a thousand years.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n[[File:Hampi aqueduct.JPG|thumb|Ancient Indian aqueduct in [[Hampi]]]]\n\n==Modern aqueducts==\n\n===Navigable aqueducts===\n{{Main|Navigable aqueduct}}\nNavigable aqueducts, also called water bridges, are water-filled bridges to allow vessels on a [[waterway]] to cross ravines or valleys. During the [[Industrial Revolution]] of the 18th century, navigable aqueducts were constructed as part of the boom in canal-building. A notable revolving aqueduct has been made on the [[Bridgewater Canal]]. This allowed vessels to cross at high and low levels while conserving water that would be lost in the operation of [[lock (water transport)|locks]].\n\n==Notable aqueducts==\n===Roman aqueducts===\n{{See also|List of aqueducts in the Roman Empire}}\n[[File:Aqueduct of Segovia 02.jpg|thumb|[[Aqueduct of Segovia]]]]\n[[File:Luna llena sobre Acueducto de Santiago de Queretaro..jpg|thumb|Aqueduct [[Santiago de Queretaro]], Mexico]]\n*The [[Pont du Gard]] in southern France\n*[[Barbegal aqueduct]], France\n*[[Aqueduto de S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o]], in [[Coimbra]], Portugal\n*[[Eifel aqueduct]], Germany\n*[[Caesarea Maritima]], [[Israel]]\n*[[Patras]], Greece\n*[[Aqueduct of Segovia]], Spain\n*[[Acueducto de los Milagros]], [[M\u00e9rida, Spain]]\n*[[Tarragona]], Spain\n*[[Almu\u00f1\u00e9car#Roman rule|Almu\u00f1\u00e9car]], Spain (5 aqueducts \u2013 4 still in use)\n*[[Valens Aqueduct]], [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]]\n*[[Aqua Augusta (disambiguation)|Aqua Augusta]], Italy\n*[[Aqua Claudia]] and the [[Anio Novus]], as part of the [[Porta Maggiore]], Rome, Italy\n*[[Aqueduct (Skopje)|Skopje Aqueduct]], [[Skopje]], [[North Macedonia]]\n\n===Other aqueducts===\n[[File:Vila do Conde 3.jpg|right|thumb|An Aqueduct in [[Vila do Conde]], Portugal]]\n[[File:Tomar December 2008-4.jpg|thumb|right|The Aqueduto dos Peg\u00f5es in [[Tomar]], Portugal]]\n[[File:Aquadukt Kavala GREECE.jpg|thumb|[[Kavala aqueduct]], Greece]]\n[[File:Planta de tratamiento de agua potable Vitelma.jpg|thumb|Aqueduct Vitelma in [[Bogot\u00e1]], Colomb]]\n\n*[[Wignacourt Aqueduct]], [[Malta]]; built in the 17th century to transport water from [[Dingli]] and [[Rabat, Malta|Rabat]] to the new capital city [[Valletta]]; today, most of its arches still survive in the localities of [[Attard]], [[Balzan]], [[Birkirkara]], [[Fleur-de-Lys, Malta|Fleur-de-Lys]] and [[Santa Venera]]\n*[[Tabarja]], aqueduct runs throughout the entire ancient town and is still actively used by the farmers of the area (built 1700-1750)\n*[[Aqueduct St-Cl\u00e9ment]], [[Montpellier]], France \u2013 17th century\n*[[Bar Aqueduct]], [[Montenegro]] \u2013 16th century\n*[[Aqueduto da Amoreira]], in [[Elvas]], Portugal (built 1537\u20131620)\n*[[\u00c1guas Livres Aqueduct]], in [[Lisbon]], Portugal (built 1731\u20131748)\n*[[Aqueduto de \u00d3bidos]], in [[\u00d3bidos, Portugal]] (built 1570)\n*[[Aqueduto de Set\u00fabal]] in [[Set\u00fabal]], Portugal (built 1696)\n*[[Aqueduto dos Peg\u00f5es]] in [[Tomar]], Portugal (built 1593)\n*[[\u00c1gua de Prata Aqueduct]], in [[\u00c9vora]], Portugal (built 1531\u20131537)\n*[[Santa Clara Aqueduct]], in [[Vila do Conde]], Portugal\n*[[Carioca Aqueduct]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]] (built 1744\u20131750)\n*[[Aqueduct of Teruel]], Spain\n*[[Roquefavour aqueduct]], France \u2013 built between 1842 and 1847\n*[[Winnipeg Aqueduct]], [[Manitoba]], Canada \u2013 built between 1915 and 1919\n*[[Mathur Aqueduct]] in [[Tamil Nadu]] state, India\n*[[Pontcysyllte Aqueduct]] in Wales, UK\n*[[Longdon-on-Tern Aqueduct]] the world's first [[cast iron]] [[navigable aqueduct]], designed by [[Thomas Telford]]\n* Surviving Spanish aqueducts in Mexico:\n**Aqueduct of [[Santiago de Quer\u00e9taro|Quer\u00e9taro]], Mexico \u2013 built between 1726 and 1738, {{convert|1.3|km|mi}} long and featuring 74 arches\n**Aqueduct of [[Zacatecas]], Zacatecas.\n**[[Aqueduct of Padre Tembleque]], [[Zempoala, Hidalgo]] Mexico \u2013 built between 1553 and 1570\n**Aqueduct of [[Morelia]], [[Michoac\u00e1n]], built between 1735 and 1738\n**[[Acueducto de los Remedios|Aqueduct of Los Remedios]], Naucalpan, Mexico, 1765\n**Aqueduct of [[Ac\u00e1mbaro]], [[Guanajuato]], built in 1528<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927184652/http://www.sectur.gob.mx/work/resources/LocalContent/7830/1/Acueducto%20de%20Acambaro.htm Mexico \u2013 Travel<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n**[[Chapultepec aqueduct]], Mexico D.F.\n*[[Kavala aqueduct]], 16th-century Ottoman aqueduct in Kavala, Greece\n*[[High Bridge (New York City)|High Bridge]], part of the former [[Croton Aqueduct]], built in 1848, is the oldest surviving bridge in New York City\n*[[Rostokino Aqueduct]] in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]] (built 1780\u20131804)\n*[[Boothtown Aqueduct]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] (built 1886\u20131888)\n*Aqueduct of [[Bogot\u00e1]], [[Colombia]], built in 1955, notable by being the most modern aqueduct of Latin America in the 20th century.\n*The Veluwemeer Aqueduct, Harderwijk, Netherlands.
