Its borders are roughly White River Parkway to the east, Tibbs Avenue to the west, 16th Street to the north, and Michigan Street to the south. It was first settled in the 1830s and grew after a bridge over [[White River (Indiana)|White River]] was built connecting to Indianapolis, which annexed the town in 1897. The modern version of the bridge is also the connection between Haughville on the west side of the river and the [[Sidney & Lois Eskenazi Hospital]] and [[Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Indianapolis|Indiana University - Purdue University Indianapolis]] on the east. The population in the late 1890s included Slovenian, German, and Irish immigrants, among other European immigrants. Early in the 21st century, the neighborhood suffered from a high crime rate and low property values. Since, organizations such as Westside Community Development Corporation and Urban Indy Development Corporation are currently working to provide access to food security, better housing, social opportunities, and economic development.<ref name=Tuohy2013 />\n\n==History==\nA portion of the neighborhood, roughly bounded by 10th Street, Belleview Place, Walnut Street. and Concord Street, is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as the '''Haughville Historic District''', a national [[Historic district (United States)|historic district]].<ref name=\"nris\"/> The district encompasses 329 contributing buildings.  This area includes the site of the former housing project, Concord Village.\n\nThe area was first settled in the 1830s when it became home to a number of merchants, whose small shops sprouted up near the west landing of the then-brand-new [[Washington Street (Indianapolis)|Washington Street]] Bridge over the [[White River (Indiana)|White River]]. By the 1880s, encouraged by the bridge and proximity to a number of new railroad lines, the town became home to a number of Irish, German, and later [[Slovenes|Slovene]] immigrants, many of whom worked in the neighborhood's two iron foundries or in meat-packing plants. The Haugh and Ketcham Iron Works gave the town its name.<ref name=Hammerand2011 />{{rp|10}} The area was incorporated in 1883 and annexed by Indianapolis in 1897.\n\nBy 1900, almost half of the neighborhood's inhabitants were Slovene, many of whom attended St. Anthony's Catholic church. Due to tensions with the largely Irish population at St. Anthony's parish, the Slovenian community petitioned Vicar General Denis D. O'Donaghue to build their own church. Permission was received and Holy Trinity Slovenian Catholic Church began in April 1906. Holy Trinity is the only Slovenian Catholic church in the United States and is also an international historical landmark. It was first designated a national church, then later as a territorial church by the Catholic hierarchy. Holy Trinity eventually became home to a school, a number of local organizations, and a Slovene community center. The church closed its doors in 2015. The neighborhood's Slovene past is one of the reasons that Indianapolis has a sister-city relationship with [[Piran, Slovenia]].

Its borders are roughly White River Parkway to the east, Tibbs Avenue to the west, 16th Street to the north, and Michigan Street to the south. It was first settled in the 1830s and grew after a bridge over [[White River (Indiana)|White River]] was built connecting to Indianapolis, which annexed the town in 1897. The modern version of the bridge is also the connection between Haughville on the west side of the river and the [[Sidney & Lois Eskenazi Hospital]] and [[Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Indianapolis|Indiana University - Purdue University Indianapolis]] on the east. The population in the late 1890s included Slovenian, German, and Irish immigrants, among other European immigrants. In the 21st century, the neighborhood suffers from a high [[crime rate]] and low property values. While the crime rate has been high and property values have been low, organizations such as Westside Community Development Corporation and Urban Indy Development Corporation are currently working to provide access to food security, better housing, social opportunities, and economic development.<ref name=Tuohy2013 />\n\n==History==\nA portion of the neighborhood, roughly bounded by 10th Street, Belleview Place, Walnut Street. and Concord Street, is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as the '''Haughville Historic District''', a national [[Historic district (United States)|historic district]].<ref name=\"nris\"/> The district encompasses 329 contributing buildings.  This area includes the site of the former housing project, Concord Village.\n\nThe area was first settled in the 1830s when it became home to a number of merchants, whose small shops sprouted up near the west landing of the then-brand-new [[Washington Street (Indianapolis)|Washington Street]] Bridge over the [[White River (Indiana)|White River]]. By the 1880s, encouraged by the bridge and proximity to a number of new railroad lines, the town became home to a number of Irish, German, and later [[Slovenes|Slovene]] immigrants, many of whom worked in the neighborhood's two iron foundries or in meat-packing plants. The Haugh and Ketcham Iron Works gave the town its name.<ref name=Hammerand2011 />{{rp|10}} The area was incorporated in 1883 and annexed by Indianapolis in 1897.\n\nBy 1900, almost half of the neighborhood's inhabitants were Slovene, many of whom attended St. Anthony's Catholic church. Due to tensions with the largely Irish population at St. Anthony's parish, the Slovenian community petitioned Vicar General Denis D. O'Donaghue to build their own church. Permission was received and Holy Trinity Slovenian Catholic Church began in April 1906. Holy Trinity is the only Slovenian Catholic church in the United States and is also an international historical landmark. It was first designated a national church, then later as a territorial church by the Catholic hierarchy. Holy Trinity eventually became home to a school, a number of local organizations, and a Slovene community center. The church closed its doors in 2015. The neighborhood's Slovene past is one of the reasons that Indianapolis has a sister-city relationship with [[Piran, Slovenia]]. The Slovenian National Home was formed in 1906 in a basement of a home across the street from Holy Trinity Slovenian Catholic Church as a place to congregate outside of the church and home. Today the \"Nash\" is located at 2717 W. 10th street, where it has been a pillar of the community since 1940.  The National Home is a private club for Slovenian people, their descendants, and friends.<ref name=\"SHAARD\">{{cite web |url=https://secure.in.gov/apps/dnr/shaard/welcome.html |title=Indiana State Historic Architectural and Archaeological Research Database (SHAARD) |publisher=Department of Natural Resources, Division of Historic Preservation and Archaeology |format=Searchable database |accessdate=August 1, 2016}}</ref> \n\nThe application to be a Historic Neighborhood indicates the period of significance to be 1895 to 1942, and shows a map of the location of the area relative to Indianapolis.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://secure.in.gov/apps/dnr/shaard/r/20c18/N/Haughville_HD_Marion_CO_Nom.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Haughville Historic District |accessdate=August 1, 2016 |first1=Suzanne T. |last1=Rollins |first2=Jon |last2=Smith |format=PDF |date=June 1992}}</ref> A map of the district itself is also available.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://secure.in.gov/apps/dnr/shaard/r/2fdf1/N/Haughville_HD_MAP.pdf |title=Site map of Haughville Historic District |accessdate=April 25, 2017}}</ref> The Haughville Historic District was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1992.<ref name=\"nris\" />\n\n== Demographics ==\n[[File:Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Haughville.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Holy Trinity Catholic Church, historically the center of the community]]\n\nAs of 2011, there were an estimated 8,043 people, a slight increase since 2000.

Ingersoll and Zobel found this design of limited use for Fourier analysis because of the very small number of frequencies measured.]]\nZobel's early work on heat conduction<ref name=heat/> was not pursued in his later career.  There are, however, some interesting connections. [[Lord Kelvin]] in his early work on the transmission line<ref>Thomson, William, [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1854RSPS....7..382T \"On the Theory of the Electric Telegraph\"], ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of London'', '''Vol 7''', pp. 382\u2013399. {{doi|10.1098/rspl.1854.0093}}</ref> derived the properties of the electric line by analogy with heat conduction.<ref>Hunt, B J, [https://books.google.com/books?id=23rBH11Q9w8C&pg=PA63 ''The Maxwellians''], p. 63, Cornell University Press, 2005 {{ISBN|0-8014-8234-8}}.</ref>  This is based on [[Conduction (heat)#Fourier's law|Fourier's law]] and the [[Heat equation|Fourier conduction equation]].  Ingersoll and Zobel describe the work of Kelvin and Fourier in their book<ref>Leonard ''et al.'', pp. 9\u201314.</ref> and Kelvin's approach to the representation of [[propagation constant|transmission function]]s would consequently have been very familiar to Zobel.  It is therefore no surprise that in Zobel's paper on the electric wave filter<ref>Zobel, pp. 3\u20134.</ref> a very similar representation is found for the transmission function of filters.\n\nSolutions to the Fourier equation can be provided by [[Fourier series]].<ref>Leonard ''et al.'', pp. 25\u201326.</ref> Ingersoll and Zobel state that in many cases the calculation involved makes the solution \"well-nigh impossible\" by analytical means.  With modern technology such a calculation is trivially easy, but Ingersoll and Zobel recommend the use of harmonic analysers, which are the mechanical counterpart of today's [[spectrum analyser]]s.  These machines add together mechanical oscillations of various frequencies, phases and amplitudes by combining them through a set of pulleys or springs; one for each oscillator.  The reverse process is also possible, driving the machine with the function and measuring the Fourier components as output.<ref>Ingersoll and Zobel, pp. 62\u201364.</ref>\n\n==Background to AT&T research==\nAfter the work of [[John R. Carson]] in 1915<ref>Carson, J R, ''Electric Circuit Theory and Operational Calculus'', 1926, McGraw-Hill, New York.</ref> it became clear that [[multiplexed]] telephone transmissions could be greatly improved by the use of [[single sideband]] suppressed carrier (SSB) transmission. Compared to basic [[amplitude modulation]] (AM) SSB has the advantage of half the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] and a fraction of the power (one sideband can have no more than 1/6 of the total power and would typically be a lot less). AM analysed in the [[frequency domain]] consists of a [[Carrier wave|carrier]] and two [[sidebands]]. The [[carrier wave]] in AM represents the majority of the transmitted power but contains no information whatsoever. The two sidebands both contain identical information so only one is required, at least from an information transmission point of view. Up to this point filtering had been by simple [[tuned circuit]]s. However, SSB required a flat response over the sideband of interest and maximum [[Selectivity (electronic)|rejection]] of the other sideband with a very sharp transition between the two. As the idea was to put another (completely different) signal in the slot vacated by the unwanted sideband it was important that all traces of it were removed to prevent [[crosstalk]]. At the same time minimum distortion (i.e. flat response) is obviously desirable for the sideband being retained. This requirement led to a big research effort in the design of electric wave filters.<ref>Bray, pp. 61,&nbsp;63.</ref>\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; ; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:20em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | '''Electric wave filters'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left; font-size: 90%;\" | The term ''electric wave filter'' was much used around Zobel's time to mean a filter designed to pass or reject waves of specified frequencies across the band. It appears in numerous papers published in the early 20th century. Sometimes used to distinguish these more advanced designs from the simple tuned circuits which preceded them. In modern usage the simpler term ''filter'' would be used and is unambiguous within the field of electronics.\n|}\n[[George A. Campbell]] and Zobel worked on this problem of extracting a single sideband from an amplitude-modulated composite wave for use in [[multiplexing]] telephone channels and the related problem of extracting (de-multiplexing) the signal at the far end of the transmission.<ref name=Bray62/><ref name=\"White, 2000\"/>\n\nInitially, the [[baseband]] pass range used was 200&nbsp;Hz to 2500&nbsp;Hz but later the [[International Telecommunication Union]] set a standard of 300&nbsp;Hz to 3.4&nbsp;kHz with 4&nbsp;kHz spacing. Thus the filtering was required to go from fully pass to fully stop in the space of 900&nbsp;Hz. This standard in telephony is still in use today and had remained widespread until it began to be supplanted by digital techniques from the 1980s onwards.<ref>Bray, pp. 62, 64.</ref>\n\nCampbell had previously utilised the [[Heaviside condition|condition]] discovered in the work of [[Oliver Heaviside]] for lossless transmission to improve the frequency response of transmission lines using [[lumped component]] inductors ([[loading coils]]). When Campbell started investigating electric wave filter design from 1910, this previous work naturally led him to filters using [[ladder network]] topology using capacitors and inductors. [[Low-pass filter|Low-pass]], [[high-pass]] and [[band-pass]] filters were designed. Sharper [[Cutoff frequency|cut-offs]] and higher [[stop-band]] rejection to any arbitrary design specification could be achieved merely by increasing the length of the ladder. The filter designs used by Campbell<ref>Campbell, G A, \"Physical Theory of the Electric Wave-Filter\", ''Bell System Tech J'', November 1922, vol 1, no 2, pp. 1\u201332.</ref> were described by Zobel as [[constant k filters]] although this was not a term used by Campbell himself.<ref>Bray, p. 53.</ref>\n\n==Innovations==\nAfter Zobel arrived at the Engineering Department of AT&T he used his mathematical skills to further improve the design of electric wave filters. Carson and Zobel developed the mathematical method of analyzing the behavior of filters now known as the [[Image impedance|image]] method whereby the impedance and transmission parameters of each section are calculated as if it is part of an infinite chain of identical sections.<ref>Chu, W, Chung-Kwei Chang, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1686520 ''Transients of Resistance-Terminated Dissipative Low-Pass and High-Pass Electric Wave Filters''], Proceedings of the IRE, vol 26, no 10, pp. 1266\u20131277, October 1938</ref>\n\n===Wave filters===\n[[Image:Zobel original drawing.PNG|thumbnail|right|450 px|An original drawing by Zobel of a band-pass filter used for impedance matching|alt=A circuit consisting of a series resonator (i.e., an inductor and capacitor in series), a shunt anti-resonator (i.e., the same devices in parallel), another series resonator in parallel with an inductor and a capacitor, and a terminating resistor. Component values are marked as multiples of the components of a prototype filter (not shown).]]\nZobel invented the [[M-derived filter|m-derived (or m-type) filter]] section in 1920, the distinguishing feature of this design being a [[Pole (complex analysis)|pole]] of attenuation close to the filter [[cut-off frequency]]. The result of this design is a filter response which falls very rapidly past the cut-off frequency. A fast transition between [[pass-band]] and [[stop-band]] was one of the primary requirements for cramming as many telephone channels as possible into one cable.<ref name=\"White, 2000\"/><ref>Matthaei ''et al.'', p. 65.</ref>\n\nOne disadvantage of the m-type section was that at frequencies past the pole of attenuation, the response of the filter started to increase again, reaching a peak somewhere in the stop-band and then falling again.<ref>Ghosh, Smarajit, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bYbP7rfG2YYC ''Network Theory: Analysis and Synthesis''], Prentice Hall of India, pp. 564\u2013569.</ref> Zobel overcame this problem by designing hybrid filters using a mixture of constant k and m-type sections. This gave Zobel the advantages of both: the fast transition of the m-type and good stop-band rejection of the constant k.<ref>Zobel, pp. 26\u201328.</ref>\n\nBy 1921 Zobel had further perfected his composite filter designs. He was now using, in addition, m-type half sections at the ends of his composite filters to improve the impedance matching of the filter to the source and the load,<ref name=\"White, 2000\"/> a technique in which he held a patent.<ref name=\"aniseed ball\">Zobel, O J, ''Terminating network for filters'', {{US patent|1557229}}, filed 30 April 1920, issued 13 Oct 1925.</ref> The difficulty that he was trying to overcome was that the [[image impedance]] techniques being used to design filter sections only gave the mathematically predicted response if they were terminated in their respective image impedances. Technically, this was easy to do within the filter as it could always be arranged that adjacent filter sections had matching image impedances (one of the characteristics of m-type sections is that one side or the other of the m-type section will have an image impedance identical to the equivalent constant k section). However, the terminating impedances are a different story. These are normally required to be resistive but the image impedance will be complex. Even worse, it is not even mathematically possible to construct a filter image impedance out of discrete components. The result of impedance mismatch is reflections and a degraded filter performance. Zobel found that a value of m=0.6<ref>Matthaei ''et al.'', pp. 72\u201374.</ref><ref>''Redifon Radio Diary, 1970'', p. 47, William Collins Sons & Co, 1969</ref> for the end half sections, while not mathematically exact, gave a good match to resistive terminations in the pass-band.<ref name=Bray62/><ref>Shea, T E, ''Transmission Networks and Wave Filters'', 1929, Bell Telephone Laboratories.</ref>\n\nAround 1923, Zobel's filter designs were reaching the peak of their complexity. He now had a filter section to which he had doubly applied the m-derivation process resulting in filter sections which he called the mm'-type. This had all the advantages of the previous m-type, but more so. An even faster transition into the stop-band and an even more constant characteristic impedance in the pass-band. At the same time one side would match into the old m-type, just as the m-type could match into the [[constant k filter|k-type]]. Because there were now two arbitrary parameters (m and m') that the filter designer could adjust, much better end matching half-sections could be designed. A composite filter using these sections would have been the very best that could have been achieved at that time. However, the mm'-type sections never became as widespread and well known as the m-type sections, possibly because their greater complexity has deterred designers. They would have been inconvenient to implement with microwave technology and the increased count of components, especially wound components, made them more expensive to implement with [[Passivity (engineering)#Passive filter|conventional LC technology]]. Certainly, it is hard to find a textbook from any period which covers their design.<ref name=\"humbug\">Zobel, O J, ''Electrical Wave Filter'', {{US patent|1850146}}, filed 25 Nov 1930, issued 22 March 1932.</ref>\n\n===Transmission line simulation===\nZobel directed much of his effort in the 1920s to constructing networks which could simulate transmission lines. These networks were derived from filter sections, which themselves had been derived from transmission line theory and the filters were used on transmission line signals.  In turn, these artificial lines were used to develop and test better filter sections.<ref>Zobel, O J, ''Electrical network'', {{US patent|1760973}}, filed 27 March 1928, issued 3 June 1930.</ref><ref>Zobel, O J, ''Electrical Network'', {{US patent|1720777}}, filed 9 Sept 1926, issued 16 July 1929.</ref><ref>Zobel, O J, ''Electrical Network'', {{US patent|1591073}}, filed 15 Dec 1922, issued 6 July 1926.</ref>\nZobel used a design technique based on his theoretical discovery that the impedance looking into the end of a filter chain was practically the same (within the limits of component tolerances) as the theoretical impedance of an infinite chain after only a small number of sections had been added to the chain. These \"image\" impedances have a mathematical characterization impossible to construct simply out of discrete components, and can only ever be approximated. Zobel found that using these impedances constructed out of small filter chains as components in a greater network allowed him to build realistic line simulators. These were not in any sense intended as practical filters in the field, but rather the intention was to construct good controllable line simulators without having the inconvenience of miles of cable to contend with.<ref>Zobel, O J, ''Selective Constant-Resistance Network'', {{US patent|1724987}}, filed 13 April 1928, issued 20 Aug 1929.</ref>\n\n===Equalisers===\nZobel invented several filters whose defining characteristic was a [[constant-resistance network|constant resistance]] as the input impedance. The resistance remained constant through the pass band and the stop band. With these designs Zobel had completely solved the impedance matching problem.  The main application of these sections has been not so much for filtering out unwanted frequencies, the k-type and m-type filters remained best for this, but rather to equalize the response in the pass band to a flat response.<ref>Zobel, O J, ''Electrical Network and Method of Transmitting Electric Currents'', {{US patent|1603305}}, filed 9 Aug 1922, issued 19 Oct 1926.</ref>\n\nPerhaps one of Zobel's most fascinating inventions is the [[Lattice phase equaliser|lattice filter]] section. This section is both constant resistance and flat response zero attenuation across the band, yet it is constructed out of inductors and capacitors. The only signal parameter it modifies is the phase of the signal at different frequencies.<ref>Zobel, O J, ''Phase-shifting network'', {{US patent|1792523}}, filed 12 March 1927, issued 17 Feb 1931.</ref>\n\n===Impedance matching===\nA common theme throughout Zobel's work is the issue of impedance matching. The obvious approach to filter design is to design directly for the attenuation characteristics desired. With modern computing power, a brute force approach is possible and easy, simply incrementally adjusting each component while recalculating in an iterative process until the desired response is achieved. However, Zobel developed a more indirect line of attack. He realized very early on that mismatched impedances inevitably meant reflections, and reflections meant a loss of signal. Improving the impedance match, conversely, would automatically improve a filter's pass-band response.<ref name=\"humbug\"/>\n\nThis impedance matching approach not only led to better filters but the techniques developed could be used to construct circuits whose sole purpose was to match together two disparate impedances.<ref name=\"chewing gum\">Zobel, O J, ''Electrical Wave Filter'', {{US patent|1615252}}, filed 9 June 1923, issued 25 Jan 1927.</ref><ref>Zobel, O J, ''Complementary filter'', {{US patent|1557230}}, filed 30 April 1920, issued 13 Oct 1925.</ref> Zobel continued to invent impedance matching networks throughout his career. During [[World War II]] he moved on to [[waveguide filter]]s for use in the newly developed [[radar]] technology.<ref>Schwartz, pp. 7\u20138.</ref> Little was published during the war for obvious reasons but towards the end with Bell Labs in the 1950s, Zobel designs for sections to match physically different waveguide sizes appear.<ref name=\"lemon drop\"/><ref name=\"pear drop\"/>  However, the circuit noted above which still bears Zobel's name today, the constant-resistance network, can be viewed as an impedance matching circuit and remains Zobel's finest achievement in this regard.<ref name=\"chocolate mouse\"/>\n\n==Loudspeaker equalisation==\nThe name of Zobel is, perhaps, most well known with regard to impedance compensation networks for loudspeakers and his designs have applications in this field. However, none of Zobel's patents or articles appear to discuss this topic. It is unclear whether he actually designed anything specifically for loudspeakers. The closest we get to this is where he speaks of impedance matching into a transducer, but here he is discussing a circuit to equalize a submarine cable,<ref name=\"chocolate mouse\"/> or in another instance where clearly he has in mind the [[hybrid transformer]] which terminates a line going into a telephone instrument on a [[phantom circuit]].<ref name=\"chewing gum\"/>\n\n==Noise==\nWhile Carson led the way theoretically, Zobel was involved in the design of filters for the purpose of noise reduction on transmission systems.<ref>Schwartz, pp. 5\u20137.</ref>\n\n===Background===\nAt the beginning of the 1920s and through to the 1930s, the thinking on noise was dominated by the radio engineers' concern with external [[Static (radio)|static]]. In modern terminology, this would include random ([[thermal noise|thermal]] and [[shot noise|shot]]) noise but those concepts were relatively unknown and little understood at the time despite an early paper by [[Walter H. Schottky|Schottky]] in 1918 on shot noise.<ref>Schottky, W, \"\u00dcber spontane Stromschwankungen in verschiedenen Elecktrizit\u00e4tsleitern\", ''Annalen der Physik'', verte folge, Band 57, 1918, pp. 541\u2013567.</ref> To the radio engineers of the time, static meant externally generated interference. The line of attack against noise from the radio engineers included developing [[directional antenna]]e and moving to higher frequencies where the problem was known not to be so severe.<ref>Schwartz, pp. 3\u20135.</ref>\n\nFor telephone engineers, what was then called \"fluctuating noise\", and would now be described as random noise, i.e. shot and thermal noise, was much more noticeable than with early radio systems. Carson broadened the radio engineers' concept of signal-to-static ratio to a more general [[signal-to-noise ratio]] and introduced a figure of merit for noise.<ref>Carson, J R, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1666797 \"Signal-to-Static-Interference Ratio in Radio Telephony\"], ''Proceedings of the IRE'', vol 11, June 1923, pp. 271\u2013274.</ref><ref>Schwartz, pp. 1, 5.</ref>\n\n===Impossibility of noise cancellation===\nThe radio engineers' preoccupation with static and the techniques being used to reduce it led to the idea that noise could be totally eliminated by, in some way, compensating for it or canceling it out. The culmination of this viewpoint was expressed in a 1928 paper by [[Edwin Armstrong]].<ref>Armstrong, E H, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1669871 \"Methods of Reducing the Effect of Atmospheric Disturbances\"], ''Proceedings of the IRE'', vol. 16 no 1, January 1928, pp. 15\u201326.</ref> This led to a famous retort by Carson in a subsequent paper, \"Noise, like the poor, will always be with us\".<ref>Carson, J R, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1670079 \"The Reduction of Atmospheric Disturbances\"], Proceedings of the IRE, vol 16 no 7, July 1928, pp. 966\u2013975.</ref>  Armstrong was technically in the wrong in this exchange, but in 1933, ironically and paradoxically, went on to invent wide-band [[FM broadcasting|FM]] which enormously improved the noise performance of radio by ''increasing'' the bandwidth.<ref>Armstrong, A H, ''Radiosignaling'', {{US Patent|1941069}}, filed 24 January 1933, issued 26 December 1933</ref>\n\nCarson and Zobel in 1923 had conclusively shown that filtering cannot remove noise to the same degree as, say, interference from another station could be removed. To do this they had analyzed random noise in the frequency domain and postulated that it contains all frequencies in its spectrum. This was the first use of [[Fourier analysis]] to describe random noise and hence described it in terms of a spread of frequencies. Also first published in this paper was the concept of what we would now call [[White noise|band-limited white noise]]. For Zobel this meant that characteristics of the receiving filter completely determine the figure of merit in the presence of white noise and that the filter design was key to achieving the optimum noise performance.<ref name=TransientOscillation>Carson, J R and Zobel, O J, \"Transient Oscillation in Electric Wave Filters\", ''Bell System Technical Journal'', vol. 2, July 1923, pp. 1\u201329.</ref>\n\nAlthough this work by Carson and Zobel was very early, it was not universally accepted that noise could be analyzed in the frequency domain in this way. For this reason, the aforementioned  exchange between Carson and Armstrong was still possible years later. The precise mathematical relationship between noise power and bandwidth for random noise was finally determined by [[Harry Nyquist]] in 1928 thus giving a theoretical limit to what could be achieved by filtering.<ref>Nyquist, H, \"Thermal Agitation of Electric Charges in Conductors\", ''Physical Review'', vol. 32, July 1928, pp. 110\u2013113. {{doi|10.1103/PhysRev.32.110}}</ref>\n\nThis work on noise produced the concept, and led Zobel to pursue the design, of [[matched filter]]s.  In this context matched means that the filter is chosen to match the signal's characteristics in order to admit all of the available signal without admitting any noise that could have been excluded. The underlying insight is that admitting as much signal as is available without admitting any noise that could be excluded will maximize the signal to noise ratio. When the signal to noise ratio is maximized, the noise performance of the equipment is optimal. This conclusion was the culmination of theoretical research into removing noise by the application of [[linear filters]].  This became important in the development of radar during the Second World War in which Zobel played a part.<ref>Schwartz, p. 7.</ref>\n\n==Use of work in genetic programming research==\nZobel's work has recently found an application in research into [[genetic programming]]. The purpose of this research is to attempt to demonstrate that the results obtained from genetic programming are comparable to human achievements. Two of the measures that are used to determine whether a genetic programming result is human-competitive are:<ref name=\"polo\">{{cite book|author=Koza, Bennet|author2=Andre, Keane|title=Genetic Programming III: Darwinian Invention and Problem Solving|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|location=San Francisco|year=1999|url=http://www.genetic-programming.com/hc/zobelcrossoverfilter.html}}</ref>\n*The result is a patented invention.\n*The result is equal to or better than a result that was considered an achievement in its field at the time of discovery.\n\nOne such problem set as a task for a genetic program was to design a [[Audio crossover|crossover filter]] for [[woofer]] and [[tweeter]] loudspeakers. The output design was identical in [[Electronic filter topology|topology]] to a design found in a patent of Zobel's<ref>Zobel, O J, ''Wave Filter'', {{US patent|1538964}}, filed 15 Jan 1921, issued 26 May 1925.</ref> for a filter to separate multiplexed low and high frequencies on a transmission line. This was judged to be human-comparable, not only because of the patent, but also because the high-pass and low-pass sections were \"[[Decomposition (computer science)|decomposed]]\" as in Zobel's design, but not specifically required to be so in the programs parameters.<ref name=\"polo\"/> Whether or not Zobel's filter design would be good for a [[hi-fi]] system is another question. The design does not actually cross over, but rather, there is a gap between the two pass-bands where the signal is not transmitted to either output. Essential for multiplexing, but not so desirable for sound reproduction.<ref>Zobel's {{US patent|1538964}} (p.4, l.23) enumerates the gap as 400 Hz</ref>\n\nA later genetic programming<ref>Chakrabarti, A, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IUiTdfVxJHwC&pg=PA328 ''Engineering Design Synthesis: Understanding, Approaches, and Tools''], p. 328, Springer, 2002.</ref> experiment produced a filter design which consisted of a chain of constant k sections terminated in an m-type half section.

Ingersoll and Zobel describe the work of Kelvin and Fourier in their book<ref>Leonard ''et al.'', pp. 9\u201314.</ref> and Kelvin's approach to the representation of [[propagation constant|transmission function]]s would consequently have been very familiar to Zobel.  It is therefore no surprise that in Zobel's paper on the electric wave filter<ref>Zobel, pp. 3\u20134.</ref> a very similar representation is found for the transmission function of filters.\n\nSolutions to the Fourier equation can be provided by [[Fourier series]].<ref>Leonard ''et al.'', pp. 25\u201326.</ref> Ingersoll and Zobel state that in many cases the calculation involved makes the solution \"well-nigh impossible\" by analytical means.  With modern technology such a calculation is trivially easy, but Ingersoll and Zobel recommend the use of harmonic analysers, which are the mechanical counterpart of today's [[spectrum analyser]]s.  These machines add together mechanical oscillations of various frequencies, phases and amplitudes by combining them through a set of pulleys or springs; one for each oscillator.  The reverse process is also possible, driving the machine with the function and measuring the Fourier components as output.<ref>Ingersoll and Zobel, pp. 62\u201364.</ref>\n\n==Background to AT&T research==\nAfter the work of [[John R. Carson]] in 1915<ref>Carson, J R, ''Electric Circuit Theory and Operational Calculus'', 1926, McGraw-Hill, New York.</ref> it became clear that [[multiplexed]] telephone transmissions could be greatly improved by the use of [[single sideband]] suppressed carrier (SSB) transmission. Compared to basic [[amplitude modulation]] (AM) SSB has the advantage of half the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] and a fraction of the power (one sideband can have no more than 1/6 of the total power and would typically be a lot less). AM analysed in the [[frequency domain]] consists of a [[Carrier wave|carrier]] and two [[sidebands]]. The [[carrier wave]] in AM represents the majority of the transmitted power but contains no information whatsoever. The two sidebands both contain identical information so only one is required, at least from an information transmission point of view. Up to this point filtering had been by simple [[tuned circuit]]s. However, SSB required a flat response over the sideband of interest and maximum [[Selectivity (electronic)|rejection]] of the other sideband with a very sharp transition between the two. As the idea was to put another (completely different) signal in the slot vacated by the unwanted sideband it was important that all traces of it were removed to prevent [[crosstalk]]. At the same time minimum distortion (i.e. flat response) is obviously desirable for the sideband being retained. This requirement led to a big research effort in the design of electric wave filters.<ref>Bray, pp. 61,&nbsp;63.</ref>\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; ; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:20em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | '''Electric wave filters'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left; font-size: 90%;\" | The term ''electric wave filter'' was much used around Zobel's time to mean a filter designed to pass or reject waves of specified frequencies across the band.

In modern usage the simpler term ''filter'' would be used and is unambiguous within the field of electronics.\n|}\n[[George A. Campbell]] and Zobel worked on this problem of extracting a single sideband from an amplitude-modulated composite wave for use in [[multiplexing]] telephone channels and the related problem of extracting (de-multiplexing) the signal at the far end of the transmission.<ref name=Bray62/><ref name=\"White, 2000\"/>\n\nInitially, the [[baseband]] pass range used was 200&nbsp;Hz to 2500&nbsp;Hz but later the [[International Telecommunication Union]] set a standard of 300&nbsp;Hz to 3.4&nbsp;kHz with 4&nbsp;kHz spacing. Thus the filtering was required to go from fully pass to fully stop in the space of 900&nbsp;Hz. This standard in telephony is still in use today and had remained widespread until it began to be supplanted by digital techniques from the 1980s onwards.<ref>Bray, pp. 62, 64.</ref>\n\nCampbell had previously utilised the [[Heaviside condition|condition]] discovered in the work of [[Oliver Heaviside]] for lossless transmission to improve the frequency response of transmission lines using [[lumped component]] inductors ([[loading coils]]). When Campbell started investigating electric wave filter design from 1910, this previous work naturally led him to filters using [[ladder network]] topology using capacitors and inductors. [[Low-pass filter|Low-pass]], [[high-pass]] and [[band-pass]] filters were designed. Sharper [[Cutoff frequency|cut-offs]] and higher [[stop-band]] rejection to any arbitrary design specification could be achieved merely by increasing the length of the ladder. The filter designs used by Campbell<ref>Campbell, G A, \"Physical Theory of the Electric Wave-Filter\", ''Bell System Tech J'', November 1922, vol 1, no 2, pp. 1\u201332.</ref> were described by Zobel as [[constant k filters]] although this was not a term used by Campbell himself.<ref>Bray, p. 53.</ref>\n\n==Innovations==\nAfter Zobel arrived at the Engineering Department of AT&T he used his mathematical skills to further improve the design of electric wave filters. Carson and Zobel developed the mathematical method of analyzing the behavior of filters now known as the [[Image impedance|image]] method whereby the impedance and transmission parameters of each section are calculated as if it is part of an infinite chain of identical sections.<ref>Chu, W, Chung-Kwei Chang, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1686520 ''Transients of Resistance-Terminated Dissipative Low-Pass and High-Pass Electric Wave Filters''], Proceedings of the IRE, vol 26, no 10, pp. 1266\u20131277, October 1938</ref>\n\n===Wave filters===\n[[Image:Zobel original drawing.PNG|thumbnail|right|450 px|An original drawing by Zobel of a band-pass filter used for impedance matching|alt=A circuit consisting of a series resonator (i.e., an inductor and capacitor in series), a shunt anti-resonator (i.e., the same devices in parallel), another series resonator in parallel with an inductor and a capacitor, and a terminating resistor.

The result of this design is a filter response which falls very rapidly past the cut-off frequency. A fast transition between [[pass-band]] and [[stop-band]] was one of the primary requirements for cramming as many telephone channels as possible into one cable.<ref name=\"White, 2000\"/><ref>Matthaei ''et al.'', p. 65.</ref>\n\nOne disadvantage of the m-type section was that at frequencies past the pole of attenuation, the response of the filter started to increase again, reaching a peak somewhere in the stop-band and then falling again.<ref>Ghosh, Smarajit, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bYbP7rfG2YYC ''Network Theory: Analysis and Synthesis''], Prentice Hall of India, pp. 564\u2013569.</ref> Zobel overcame this problem by designing hybrid filters using a mixture of constant k and m-type sections. This gave Zobel the advantages of both: the fast transition of the m-type and good stop-band rejection of the constant k.<ref>Zobel, pp. 26\u201328.</ref>\n\nBy 1921 Zobel had further perfected his composite filter designs. He was now using, in addition, m-type half sections at the ends of his composite filters to improve the impedance matching of the filter to the source and the load,<ref name=\"White, 2000\"/> a technique in which he held a patent.<ref name=\"aniseed ball\">Zobel, O J, ''Terminating network for filters'', {{US patent|1557229}}, filed 30 April 1920, issued 13 Oct 1925.</ref> The difficulty that he was trying to overcome was that the [[image impedance]] techniques being used to design filter sections only gave the mathematically predicted response if they were terminated in their respective image impedances. Technically, this was easy to do within the filter as it could always be arranged that adjacent filter sections had matching image impedances (one of the characteristics of m-type sections is that one side or the other of the m-type section will have an image impedance identical to the equivalent constant k section). However, the terminating impedances are a different story. These are normally required to be resistive but the image impedance will be complex. Even worse, it is not even mathematically possible to construct a filter image impedance out of discrete components. The result of impedance mismatch is reflections and a degraded filter performance. Zobel found that a value of m=0.6<ref>Matthaei ''et al.'', pp. 72\u201374.</ref><ref>''Redifon Radio Diary, 1970'', p. 47, William Collins Sons & Co, 1969</ref> for the end half sections, while not mathematically exact, gave a good match to resistive terminations in the pass-band.<ref name=Bray62/><ref>Shea, T E, ''Transmission Networks and Wave Filters'', 1929, Bell Telephone Laboratories.</ref>\n\nAround 1923, Zobel's filter designs were reaching the peak of their complexity. He now had a filter section to which he had doubly applied the m-derivation process resulting in filter sections which he called the mm'-type. This had all the advantages of the previous m-type, but more so. An even faster transition into the stop-band and an even more constant characteristic impedance in the pass-band. At the same time one side would match into the old m-type, just as the m-type could match into the [[constant k filter|k-type]]. Because there were now two arbitrary parameters (m and m') that the filter designer could adjust, much better end matching half-sections could be designed. A composite filter using these sections would have been the very best that could have been achieved at that time. However, the mm'-type sections never became as widespread and well known as the m-type sections, possibly because their greater complexity has deterred designers. They would have been inconvenient to implement with microwave technology and the increased count of components, especially wound components, made them more expensive to implement with [[Passivity (engineering)#Passive filter|conventional LC technology]]. Certainly, it is hard to find a textbook from any period which covers their design.<ref name=\"humbug\">Zobel, O J, ''Electrical Wave Filter'', {{US patent|1850146}}, filed 25 Nov 1930, issued 22 March 1932.</ref>\n\n===Transmission line simulation===\nZobel directed much of his effort in the 1920s to constructing networks which could simulate transmission lines. These networks were derived from filter sections, which themselves had been derived from transmission line theory and the filters were used on transmission line signals.  In turn, these artificial lines were used to develop and test better filter sections.<ref>Zobel, O J, ''Electrical network'', {{US patent|1760973}}, filed 27 March 1928, issued 3 June 1930.</ref><ref>Zobel, O J, ''Electrical Network'', {{US patent|1720777}}, filed 9 Sept 1926, issued 16 July 1929.</ref><ref>Zobel, O J, ''Electrical Network'', {{US patent|1591073}}, filed 15 Dec 1922, issued 6 July 1926.</ref>\nZobel used a design technique based on his theoretical discovery that the impedance looking into the end of a filter chain was practically the same (within the limits of component tolerances) as the theoretical impedance of an infinite chain after only a small number of sections had been added to the chain. These \"image\" impedances have a mathematical characterization impossible to construct simply out of discrete components, and can only ever be approximated. Zobel found that using these impedances constructed out of small filter chains as components in a greater network allowed him to build realistic line simulators. These were not in any sense intended as practical filters in the field, but rather the intention was to construct good controllable line simulators without having the inconvenience of miles of cable to contend with.<ref>Zobel, O J, ''Selective Constant-Resistance Network'', {{US patent|1724987}}, filed 13 April 1928, issued 20 Aug 1929.</ref>\n\n===Equalisers===\nZobel invented several filters whose defining characteristic was a [[constant-resistance network|constant resistance]] as the input impedance. The resistance remained constant through the pass band and the stop band. With these designs Zobel had completely solved the impedance matching problem.  The main application of these sections has been not so much for filtering out unwanted frequencies, the k-type and m-type filters remained best for this, but rather to equalize the response in the pass band to a flat response.<ref>Zobel, O J, ''Electrical Network and Method of Transmitting Electric Currents'', {{US patent|1603305}}, filed 9 Aug 1922, issued 19 Oct 1926.</ref>\n\nPerhaps one of Zobel's most fascinating inventions is the [[Lattice phase equaliser|lattice filter]] section. This section is both constant resistance and flat response zero attenuation across the band, yet it is constructed out of inductors and capacitors. The only signal parameter it modifies is the phase of the signal at different frequencies.<ref>Zobel, O J, ''Phase-shifting network'', {{US patent|1792523}}, filed 12 March 1927, issued 17 Feb 1931.</ref>\n\n===Impedance matching===\nA common theme throughout Zobel's work is the issue of impedance matching. The obvious approach to filter design is to design directly for the attenuation characteristics desired. With modern computing power, a brute force approach is possible and easy, simply incrementally adjusting each component while recalculating in an iterative process until the desired response is achieved. However, Zobel developed a more indirect line of attack. He realized very early on that mismatched impedances inevitably meant reflections, and reflections meant a loss of signal. Improving the impedance match, conversely, would automatically improve a filter's pass-band response.<ref name=\"humbug\"/>\n\nThis impedance matching approach not only led to better filters but the techniques developed could be used to construct circuits whose sole purpose was to match together two disparate impedances.<ref name=\"chewing gum\">Zobel, O J, ''Electrical Wave Filter'', {{US patent|1615252}}, filed 9 June 1923, issued 25 Jan 1927.</ref><ref>Zobel, O J, ''Complementary filter'', {{US patent|1557230}}, filed 30 April 1920, issued 13 Oct 1925.</ref> Zobel continued to invent impedance matching networks throughout his career. During [[World War II]] he moved on to [[waveguide filter]]s for use in the newly developed [[radar]] technology.<ref>Schwartz, pp. 7\u20138.</ref> Little was published during the war for obvious reasons but towards the end with Bell Labs in the 1950s, Zobel designs for sections to match physically different waveguide sizes appear.<ref name=\"lemon drop\"/><ref name=\"pear drop\"/>  However, the circuit noted above which still bears Zobel's name today, the constant-resistance network, can be viewed as an impedance matching circuit and remains Zobel's finest achievement in this regard.<ref name=\"chocolate mouse\"/>\n\n==Loudspeaker equalisation==\nThe name of Zobel is, perhaps, most well known with regard to impedance compensation networks for loudspeakers and his designs have applications in this field. However, none of Zobel's patents or articles appear to discuss this topic. It is unclear whether he actually designed anything specifically for loudspeakers. The closest we get to this is where he speaks of impedance matching into a transducer, but here he is discussing a circuit to equalize a submarine cable,<ref name=\"chocolate mouse\"/> or in another instance where clearly he has in mind the [[hybrid transformer]] which terminates a line going into a telephone instrument on a [[phantom circuit]].<ref name=\"chewing gum\"/>\n\n==Noise==\nWhile Carson led the way theoretically, Zobel was involved in the design of filters for the purpose of noise reduction on transmission systems.<ref>Schwartz, pp. 5\u20137.</ref>\n\n===Background===\nAt the beginning of the 1920s and through to the 1930s, the thinking on noise was dominated by the radio engineers' concern with external [[Static (radio)|static]]. In modern terminology, this would include random ([[thermal noise|thermal]] and [[shot noise|shot]]) noise but those concepts were relatively unknown and little understood at the time despite an early paper by [[Walter H. Schottky|Schottky]] in 1918 on shot noise.<ref>Schottky, W, \"\u00dcber spontane Stromschwankungen in verschiedenen Elecktrizit\u00e4tsleitern\", ''Annalen der Physik'', verte folge, Band 57, 1918, pp. 541\u2013567.</ref> To the radio engineers of the time, static meant externally generated interference. The line of attack against noise from the radio engineers included developing [[directional antenna]]e and moving to higher frequencies where the problem was known not to be so severe.<ref>Schwartz, pp. 3\u20135.</ref>\n\nFor telephone engineers, what was then called \"fluctuating noise\", and would now be described as random noise, i.e. shot and thermal noise, was much more noticeable than with early radio systems. Carson broadened the radio engineers' concept of signal-to-static ratio to a more general [[signal-to-noise ratio]] and introduced a figure of merit for noise.<ref>Carson, J R, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1666797 \"Signal-to-Static-Interference Ratio in Radio Telephony\"], ''Proceedings of the IRE'', vol 11, June 1923, pp. 271\u2013274.</ref><ref>Schwartz, pp. 1, 5.</ref>\n\n===Impossibility of noise cancellation===\nThe radio engineers' preoccupation with static and the techniques being used to reduce it led to the idea that noise could be totally eliminated by, in some way, compensating for it or canceling it out. The culmination of this viewpoint was expressed in a 1928 paper by [[Edwin Armstrong]].<ref>Armstrong, E H, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1669871 \"Methods of Reducing the Effect of Atmospheric Disturbances\"], ''Proceedings of the IRE'', vol. 16 no 1, January 1928, pp. 15\u201326.</ref> This led to a famous retort by Carson in a subsequent paper, \"Noise, like the poor, will always be with us\".<ref>Carson, J R, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1670079 \"The Reduction of Atmospheric Disturbances\"], Proceedings of the IRE, vol 16 no 7, July 1928, pp. 966\u2013975.</ref>  Armstrong was technically in the wrong in this exchange, but in 1933, ironically and paradoxically, went on to invent wide-band [[FM broadcasting|FM]] which enormously improved the noise performance of radio by ''increasing'' the bandwidth.<ref>Armstrong, A H, ''Radiosignaling'', {{US Patent|1941069}}, filed 24 January 1933, issued 26 December 1933</ref>\n\nCarson and Zobel in 1923 had conclusively shown that filtering cannot remove noise to the same degree as, say, interference from another station could be removed. To do this they had analyzed random noise in the frequency domain and postulated that it contains all frequencies in its spectrum. This was the first use of [[Fourier analysis]] to describe random noise and hence described it in terms of a spread of frequencies. Also first published in this paper was the concept of what we would now call [[White noise|band-limited white noise]]. For Zobel this meant that characteristics of the receiving filter completely determine the figure of merit in the presence of white noise and that the filter design was key to achieving the optimum noise performance.<ref name=TransientOscillation>Carson, J R and Zobel, O J, \"Transient Oscillation in Electric Wave Filters\", ''Bell System Technical Journal'', vol. 2, July 1923, pp. 1\u201329.</ref>\n\nAlthough this work by Carson and Zobel was very early, it was not universally accepted that noise could be analyzed in the frequency domain in this way. For this reason, the aforementioned  exchange between Carson and Armstrong was still possible years later. The precise mathematical relationship between noise power and bandwidth for random noise was finally determined by [[Harry Nyquist]] in 1928 thus giving a theoretical limit to what could be achieved by filtering.<ref>Nyquist, H, \"Thermal Agitation of Electric Charges in Conductors\", ''Physical Review'', vol. 32, July 1928, pp. 110\u2013113. {{doi|10.1103/PhysRev.32.110}}</ref>\n\nThis work on noise produced the concept, and led Zobel to pursue the design, of [[matched filter]]s.  In this context matched means that the filter is chosen to match the signal's characteristics in order to admit all of the available signal without admitting any noise that could have been excluded. The underlying insight is that admitting as much signal as is available without admitting any noise that could be excluded will maximize the signal to noise ratio. When the signal to noise ratio is maximized, the noise performance of the equipment is optimal. This conclusion was the culmination of theoretical research into removing noise by the application of [[linear filters]].  This became important in the development of radar during the Second World War in which Zobel played a part.<ref>Schwartz, p. 7.</ref>\n\n==Use of work in genetic programming research==\nZobel's work has recently found an application in research into [[genetic programming]]. The purpose of this research is to attempt to demonstrate that the results obtained from genetic programming are comparable to human achievements. Two of the measures that are used to determine whether a genetic programming result is human-competitive are:<ref name=\"polo\">{{cite book|author=Koza, Bennet|author2=Andre, Keane|title=Genetic Programming III: Darwinian Invention and Problem Solving|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|location=San Francisco|year=1999|url=http://www.genetic-programming.com/hc/zobelcrossoverfilter.html}}</ref>\n*The result is a patented invention.\n*The result is equal to or better than a result that was considered an achievement in its field at the time of discovery.\n\nOne such problem set as a task for a genetic program was to design a [[Audio crossover|crossover filter]] for [[woofer]] and [[tweeter]] loudspeakers. The output design was identical in [[Electronic filter topology|topology]] to a design found in a patent of Zobel's<ref>Zobel, O J, ''Wave Filter'', {{US patent|1538964}}, filed 15 Jan 1921, issued 26 May 1925.</ref> for a filter to separate multiplexed low and high frequencies on a transmission line. This was judged to be human-comparable, not only because of the patent, but also because the high-pass and low-pass sections were \"[[Decomposition (computer science)|decomposed]]\" as in Zobel's design, but not specifically required to be so in the programs parameters.<ref name=\"polo\"/> Whether or not Zobel's filter design would be good for a [[hi-fi]] system is another question. The design does not actually cross over, but rather, there is a gap between the two pass-bands where the signal is not transmitted to either output. Essential for multiplexing, but not so desirable for sound reproduction.<ref>Zobel's {{US patent|1538964}} (p.4, l.23) enumerates the gap as 400 Hz</ref>\n\nA later genetic programming<ref>Chakrabarti, A, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IUiTdfVxJHwC&pg=PA328 ''Engineering Design Synthesis: Understanding, Approaches, and Tools''], p. 328, Springer, 2002.</ref> experiment produced a filter design which consisted of a chain of constant k sections terminated in an m-type half section. This was also determined to have been a design patented by Zobel.<ref name=\"aniseed ball\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n*[[John Bray (communications engineer)|Bray, J]], ''Innovation and the Communications Revolution'', [[Institution of Electrical Engineers]], 2002 {{ISBN|0-85296-218-5}}.\n*Leonard, R, Zobel, O J, Ingersoll, A C, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cjyREwANqwUC&pg=PP1 ''An Introduction to the Mathematical Theory of Heat Conduction with Engineering and Geological Applications''], 1913, Ginn and Co, Boston, New York.\n*Matthaei, G L; Young, L; Jones, E M T, ''Microwave Filters, Impedance-Matching Networks, and Coupling Structures'' McGraw-Hill 1964 (1980 edition is {{ISBN|0-89006-099-1}}).\n*Schwartz, M, \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20090420124216/http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/symposiums/SchwartzM-paper.pdf Improving the Noise Performance of Communication Systems: 1920s to early 1930s]\", ''Technologies, Technologists & Networks: A Symposium on the History of Communication Technologies'', October 17, 2007, Smithsonian National Postal Museum.\n*Zobel, O J,''Theory and Design of Uniform and Composite Electric Wave Filters'', Bell System Technical Journal, '''Vol. 2''' (1923), pp.&nbsp;1\u201346.\n\n{{Authority control}}<!--old VIAF number; no longer works: 228155844; another cluster at: 218312213-->\n\n{{featured article}}\n\n{{Portal bar|Biography|Electronics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Zobel, Otto Julius}}\n[[Category:1887 births]]\n[[Category:1970 deaths]]\n[[Category:American electrical engineers]]\n[[Category:American electronics engineers]]\n[[Category:Engineers from Wisconsin]]\n[[Category:People from Ripon, Wisconsin]]\n[[Category:People from Morristown, New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Radio pioneers]]\n[[Category:Ripon College (Wisconsin) alumni]]\n[[Category:Scientists at Bell Labs]]\n[[Category:University of Minnesota faculty]]\n[[Category:University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison alumni]]\n[[Category:Engineers from New Jersey]]\n[[Category:20th-century American inventors]]\n", "name_user": "Eisfbnore", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSources:spc", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Julius_Zobel"}

Based on a concept by [[Ram Gopal Varma]] and produced by [[R. R. Venkat]] under the banner R. R. Movie Makers, the film features [[Mahesh Babu]], [[Kajal Aggarwal]], and [[Prakash Raj]] in the lead roles, while [[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]], [[Sayaji Shinde]], [[Raza Murad]], [[Subbaraju]], and [[Brahmaji]] play supporting roles. The film features dialogue in Telugu despite the [[Mumbai]] backdrop, for the convenience of the viewers, and a disclaimer at the beginning of the film is given regarding the same.\n\nThe film follows Vijay Surya alias Surya Bhai: a ruthless man who arrives from [[South India]] in Mumbai with aspirations to rule it, just as the Mumbai police declare the end of the \"[[Mafia Raj]]\". He begins his journey by helping a local politician and trapping the city commissioner's daughter. As he becomes a mass savior with the help of his gang, his real intentions and personal grudges against the corrupt established system get highlighted further. However, he faces violent challenges from his enemies and the cops he supposedly respects.\n\n[[S. Thaman]] composed the film's music and [[Shyam K. Naidu]] was the film's cinematographer. The film was made with a budget of {{INR}}400 million and was launched formally on 15 August 2011 at [[Hyderabad]]. [[Principal photography]] began on 2 September 2011 and was shot in Hyderabad, [[Mumbai]] and [[Goa]]. A few song sequences were shot in [[Bangkok]]. Filming ended on 10 December 2011 in 74 working days, one of the shortest periods in which a Telugu film has been shot.\n\nReleased during [[Makar Sankranti|Sankranthi]]{{efn|Sankranthi is an Indian traditional [[harvest festival]] celebrated on 14 January of [[gregorian calendar]]. It is a solar event making one of the few Indian festivals which fall on the same date in the calendar with some exceptions when the festival is celebrated on 13 or 15 January}} on 13 January 2012, the film received mixed feedback from critics, but was commercially successful. It grossed more than {{INR}}700 million and collected a distributor share of {{INR}}448 million, eventually becoming one of the highest grossing Telugu films of 2012. The film was remade in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] as ''[[Boss: Born to Rule]]'' in 2013.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[File:Mumbai 03-2016 52 Dharavi near Mahim Junction.jpg|thumb|The [[Dharavi]] slum in [[Mumbai]], the film's setting.]]\n\nAs Mumbai Police commissioner Ajay Bhardwaj ([[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]]) has declared the end of mafia in the city, a ruthless man named Vijay Surya ([[Mahesh Babu]]) arrives with intentions to conquer it. Staying at Dharavi with his friend ([[Brahmaji]]), Surya recruits a group of criminals led by Naseer and wins the support of a local politician named Laalu ([[Sayaji Shinde]]) after getting a witness to his crimes killed by his henchman Shakeel. Surya further helps the Dharavi locals clear their debts by making his henchmen rob the original copies of the loan documents in the local branch of [[Bank of Maharashtra]] and destroy the bank records. While the locals hail him as their savior, Surya becomes popular and feared for [[extortion]]. In order to safeguard himself from Ajay, Surya traps his daughter Chitra Bhardwaj ([[Kajal Agarwal]]) and pretends to fall for her.\n\nOne day, Surya learns that ten people have been sent by central minister Jaidev Ghanapuleti ([[Prakash Raj]]), who aspires to be the next prime minister, to kill him. Surya tricks the men into believing that he is a guide sent to help them. He plants a bomb in their food that explodes, resulting in a shootout. While escaping, Surya sees Chitra, who has now learnt of his true nature. As he is arrested, Surya accepts that he trapped her, but now he truly loves her. However, Ajay is forced to free Surya after his henchmen kidnap Chitra. Surya promises to give up crime in order to marry Chitra, but he decides to set up a business which is untouchable by the police, after his proposal is turned down.\n\nSurya starts a company named ''Surya Exports & Imports'' as a front for his vigilante acts. In order to set up branch offices all over the country, Surya recruits local gangsters for staff and begins to forcibly extract a 2% tax on every contract made in the respective areas. Eventually, Surya becomes a billionaire, and during the inauguration of his \"Business Bank\", reveals his thirst for power to Ajay, further citing the decline in crime rate after recruiting the gangsters, and expressing his desire to help the needy. Surya further helps Laalu become the Mayor of Mumbai by defeating Arun Gokhle, endorsed and later killed by Jaidev after Arun reveals scams to Ajay.\n\nLearning that Jaidev is planning to get both Chitra and Ajay killed, Surya rushes to their house but fails to save Ajay, who tells him to kill Jaidev in his final moments. Surya then reveals to Chitra that he was an American-born Indian whose philanthropist parents were cheated and killed by Jaidev. As a child, Surya tried to enlist police help but finding none, he ended up stabbing and shooting Jaidev publicly. Back to the resent, Surya meets Guru Govind Patel, the head of the opposition party through Laalu, and offers him {{INR}}350 billion for election campaigning along with the promise to make him the next Prime Minister of India. \n\nSurya spends millions per constituency in the nation and also reveals Jaidev's illegal affairs, making him unable to contest in the elections. A vengeful Jaidev kidnaps Chitra, and Surya goes to rescue her. Jaidev thrashes him and reveals that he gained public sympathy due to Surya's attack as a child, and managed to become a [[Member of Legislative Assembly|MLA]]. However, Surya gets into a fight with Jaidev's henchmen and leaves them all dead, except one who holds Chitra at knifepoint. Jaidev agrees to free Chitra if Surya dies. Surya shoots himself before shooting both Jaidev and the henchman to death. Chitra accepts her love for Surya, and Guru Govind Patel wins the elections. While recovering in the hospital, Surya delivers a message to the public.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Mahesh Babu]] as Vijay Surya / Surya Bhai<ref>''Businessman''. (DVD).

Based on a concept by [[Ram Gopal Varma]] and produced by [[R. R. Venkat]] under the banner R. R. Movie Makers, the film features [[Mahesh Babu]], [[Kajal Aggarwal]], and [[Prakash Raj]] in the lead roles, while [[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]], [[Sayaji Shinde]], [[Raza Murad]], [[Subbaraju]], and [[Brahmaji]] play supporting roles. The film features dialogue in Telugu despite the [[Mumbai]] backdrop, for the convenience of the viewers, and a disclaimer at the beginning of the film is given regarding the same.\n\nThe film follows Vijay Surya alias Surya Bhai: a ruthless man who arrives from [[South India]] in Mumbai with aspirations to rule it, just as the Mumbai police declare the end of the \"[[Mafia Raj]]\". He begins his journey by helping a local politician and trapping the city commissioner's daughter. As he becomes a mass savior with the help of his gang, his real intentions and personal grudges against the corrupt established system get highlighted further. However, he faces violent challenges from his enemies and the cops he supposedly respects.\n\n[[S. Thaman]] composed the film's music and [[Shyam K. Naidu]] was the film's cinematographer. The film was made with a budget of {{INR}}400 million and was launched formally on 15 August 2011 at [[Hyderabad]]. [[Principal photography]] began on 2 September 2011 and was shot in Hyderabad, [[Mumbai]] and [[Goa]]. A few song sequences were shot in [[Bangkok]]. Filming ended on 10 December 2011 in 74 working days, one of the shortest periods in which a Telugu film has been shot.\n\nReleased during [[Makar Sankranti|Sankranthi]]{{efn|Sankranthi is an Indian traditional [[harvest festival]] celebrated on 14 January of [[gregorian calendar]].

It grossed more than {{INR}}700 million and collected a distributor share of {{INR}}448 million, eventually becoming one of the highest grossing Telugu films of 2012. The film was remade in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] as ''[[Boss: Born to Rule]]'' in 2013.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[File:Mumbai 03-2016 52 Dharavi near Mahim Junction.jpg|thumb|The [[Dharavi]] slum in [[Mumbai]], the film's setting.]]\n\nAs Mumbai Police commissioner Ajay Bhardwaj ([[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]]) has declared the end of mafia in the city, a ruthless man named Vijay Surya ([[Mahesh Babu]]) arrives with intentions to conquer it. Staying at Dharavi with his friend ([[Brahmaji]]), Surya recruits a group of criminals led by Naseer and wins the support of a local politician named Laalu ([[Sayaji Shinde]]) after getting a witness to his crimes killed by his henchman Shakeel. Surya further helps the Dharavi locals clear their debts by making his henchmen rob the original copies of the loan documents in the local branch of [[Bank of Maharashtra]] and destroy the bank records. While the locals hail him as their savior, Surya becomes popular and feared for [[extortion]]. In order to safeguard himself from Ajay, Surya traps his daughter Chitra Bhardwaj ([[Kajal Agarwal]]) and pretends to fall for her.\n\nOne day, Surya learns that 10 people have been sent by central minister Jaidev Ghanapuleti ([[Prakash Raj]]), who aspires to be the next prime minister, to kill him. Surya tricks the men into believing that he is a guide sent to help them. He plants a bomb in their food that explodes, resulting in a shootout. While escaping, Surya sees Chitra, who has now learnt of his true nature. As he is arrested, Surya accepts that he trapped her, but now he truly loves her. However, Ajay is forced to free Surya after his henchmen kidnap Chitra. Surya promises to give up crime in order to get married to Chitra, but he decides to set up a business which is untouchable by the police, after his proposal is turned down.\n\nSurya starts a company named ''Surya Exports & Imports'' as a front for his vigilante acts. In order to set up branch offices all over the country, Surya recruits local gangsters for staff and begins to forcibly extract a 2% tax on every contract made in the respective areas. Eventually, Surya becomes a billionaire, and during the inauguration of his \"Business Bank\", reveals his thirst for power to Ajay, further citing the decline in crime rate after recruiting the gangsters, and expressing his desire to help the needy. Surya further helps Laalu become the Mayor of Mumbai by defeating Arun Gokhle, endorsed and later killed by Jaidev after Arun reveals scams to Ajay.\n\nLearning that Jaidev is planning to get both Chitra and Ajay killed, Surya rushes to their house but fails to save Ajay, who tells him to kill Jaidev in his final moments. Surya then reveals to Chitra that he was an American-born Indian whose philanthropist parents were cheated and killed by Jaidev. As a child, Surya tried to enlist police help but finding none, he ended up stabbing and shooting Jaidev publicly. Back to the resent, Surya meets Guru Govind Patel, the head of the opposition party through Laalu, and offers him {{INR}}350 billion for election campaigning along with the promise to make him the next Prime Minister of India. \n\nSurya spends millions per constituency in the nation and also reveals Jaidev's illegal affairs, making him unable to contest in the elections. A vengeful Jaidev kidnaps Chitra, and Surya goes to rescue her. Jaidev thrashes him and reveals that he gained public sympathy due to Surya's attack as a child, and managed to become a [[Member of Legislative Assembly|MLA]]. However, Surya gets into a fight with Jaidev's henchmen and leaves them all dead, except one who holds Chitra at knifepoint. Jaidev agrees to free Chitra if Surya dies. Surya shoots himself before shooting both Jaidev and the henchman to death. Chitra accepts her love for Surya, and Guru Govind Patel wins the elections. While recovering in the hospital, Surya delivers a message to the public.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Mahesh Babu]] as Vijay Surya / Surya Bhai<ref>''Businessman''. (DVD).
