MacArthur stated, \"''I'm not into all that is traditionally known as dispensationalism, seven dispensations, two kingdoms, two New Covenants, two ways of salvation, discontinuity between the Old Testament and the New.''\"<ref name=\"MacArthur, John\"/>\n\n=== [[Soteriology]] ===\nMacArthur was a key person in the [[Lordship salvation controversy]] in the 1980s, arguing against [[free grace theology]]. He states, \"You must receive Jesus Christ for who He is, both Lord and Savior, to be truly saved (II Peter 2:20).\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Gospel According to Jesus |author=MacArthur, John |isbn=0-310-39491-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/gospelaccordingt00maca_0 }}</ref> Regarding [[eternal security]], he states, \"It should never be presented merely as a matter of being once saved, always saved\u2014with no regard for what you believe or do. The writer of Hebrews 12:14 states frankly that only those who continue living holy lives will enter the Lord's presence.\" MacArthur's views raised controversy within American Evangelicalism and were challenged in print by non-lordship dispensationalist theologians [[Charles Ryrie]] and [[Zane C. Hodges]], who argued that MacArthur was teaching a form of works-based salvation. MacArthur has denied the charge, as attested on two tapes recorded in 1989 when he was asked to reason together with IFCA man.<ref>https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/90-37/ifca-meeting-62689-part-2 https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/90-36/ifca-meeting-62689-part-1</ref>\n\nIn December 1989, the [[Bible Broadcasting Network]] terminated MacArthur's ''Grace to You'' program. In explaining that step, BBN president Lowell Davey referred to MacArthur's teachings on the blood of Christ and \"Lordship salvation.\" Davey called these teachings \"confusing\". In a letter dated January 15, 1990, Davey cited a \"drift by Dr. MacArthur to a theological position that we could not adhere to\" and said that MacArthur's sermon series on the theology of election \"convinced us that the direction of 'Grace to You' was toward Hyper-Calvinism.\" MacArthur preaches salvation by election of God's sovereignty.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chosen from Eternity: Chosen by God--Part 1 |author=MacArthur, John |url=http://www.gty.org/Resources/Sermons/60-2}}</ref> However, the term \"Hyper-Calvinism\" is used by some to denote 5-point Calvinism or even any strong defense of Calvinism, rather than the historical \"Hyper-Calvinism\" position denies the doctrine of duty faith. This position does not seem to accurately reflect MacArthur's position in his sermons. The controversy concerning the efficacy of Christ's blood stems from MacArthur's statement that it is not the literal liquid blood of Christ that saves, but his sacrificial death on [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], a view that he espoused in an article titled \"Not His Bleeding, but His Dying,\" published in the May 1976 issue of the ''Grace to You'' family paper distributed to his church. MacArthur himself, though, later clarified what was stated of him in the article, noting his position concerning Christ's blood and death in atonement, mentioning that the efficacy of Christ's blood is not some particular physical property of the blood itself, but the fact that He shed blood in dying, and his affirmation that Christ's blood in death was necessary to satisfy God's holy requirement for atonement.<ref>{{cite web |title=What's All the Controversy About John MacArthur and the Blood of Christ? |url=http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/articles/blood.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205235106/http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/articles/blood.htm |archivedate=December 5, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Christology ===\nIn 1983, MacArthur first published his belief in the doctrine of \"[[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnational sonship]].\" In 1989, after some criticism, he defended his views in a plenary session of the annual convention of the [[Independent Fundamental Churches of America]]. In an article on MacArthur's web site ''Grace to You'' entitled \"Reexamining the Eternal Sonship of Christ,\" he retraces his views from 1983 onward, concluding, \"I want to state publicly that I have abandoned the doctrine of 'incarnational sonship.' Careful study and reflection have brought me to understand that Scripture does indeed present the relationship between God the Father and Christ the Son as an eternal Father-Son relationship. I no longer regard Christ's sonship as a role He assumed in His incarnation.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Reexamining the Eternal Sonship of Christ |author=MacArthur, John |publisher=Grace to You |url=http://www.gty.org/Resources/Articles/593}}</ref>{{original research inline |date=March 2011}}\n\n=== Cessationism ===\n[[Image:Charismatic Chaos.jpg|thumb|widthpx|''Charismatic Chaos'' - one of the books where MacArthur argues for cessationism.]]\nMacArthur is a [[cessationism|cessationist]] and is one of the most prominent voices in the church against the [[continuationism|continuationist]] beliefs of [[Pentecostalism]] and the [[Charismatic Movement]]. He has written three books in support of his position: ''The Charismatics'' (1978), ''Charismatic Chaos'' (1993), and ''Strange Fire: The Danger of Offending the Holy Spirit with Counterfeit Worship'' (2013). In October 2013, he hosted a conference called \"Strange Fire\" at his church to mark the launch of his book of the same name. The event featured a number of speakers who argued for a cessationist theology and strongly critiqued the Charismatic Movement.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Menzie|first1=Nicola|title='Strange Fire' Conference: John MacArthur Calls Out Charismatic Movement as 'Unfaithful'|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/strange-fire-conference-john-macarthur-calls-out-charismatic-movement-as-unfaithful-106849/|website=The Christian Post|publisher=The Christian Post|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref> In his opening remarks, MacArthur stated, \"Watching the behavior of some Hindus who belong to the Kundalini cult. Their body movements are almost identical to that of people in the charismatic movement, the extreme behavior of pagans. This is the work of Satan, it is the work of darkness, and not to be attributed to the Holy Spirit\". And that, \"The Charismatic movement as such has made no contribution to biblical clarity, interpretation, or sound doctrine ... It detracts and confuses.\" \"It has only produced distortion, confusion, and error.\" \"Have people truly been saved in Charismatic churches? Yes. But nothing coming from that movement has been the reason they were saved.\" \"Evangelicalism has thrown its arms open and has welcomed the Trojan horse of the charismatic movement into the city of God.

However, he saw its interdenominational presence as being \"a testimony to the absence of any theology,\" and charged that \"its theology is both heterodox and heretical...everything is defined by experience..and therefore has a weak view of Scripture, that's the charismatic movement.\" He further criticized the modern Charismatic movement, stating that \"In 1967 a bunch of Jesus freak people in the beach areas of Southern California go to [[Calvary Chapel]]..and for the first time, the church, that I know of in history, the church lets the very defined subculture dictate what it will be. Out go the ties, out go the hymns, out go all the normal and formal things...and the hippie culture, you know, kids coming out of drugs, communal living, free sex, and all that kind of casual thing, and that's a charismatic church, that's a four-square church...That's where the movement becomes what we know as Calvary Chapel.\" \"The first Calvary Chapel was essentially the church saying we'll let the culture tell us what we need to be...The charismatic movement has developed...its comfortable in Roman Catholicism, its comfortable in dead denominationalism...I think its a false form of Christianity.\"<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYulTGso804/JohnMacArthur|title=John MacArthur \"What has happened after the 'Strange Fire' Conference\"|publisher=YouTube |date=August 28, 2013 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991 however, MacArthur commended [[Chuck Smith (pastor)|Chuck Smith]], founder of the Calvary Chapel movement, for writing \"a straight forward critique of charismatic extremism,\" and stated that \"there are many like him who have taken their stand and I thank God for their courage and their desire to be Biblical.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=MacArthur|first=John|title=Does God Promise Health and Wealth?

Addressing the \"Strange Fire\" conference, continuationist [[Calvinist Baptist]] [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]] concurs that there are many abuses in the charismatic church, however he adds that \"we really need to keep in mind that every charismatic abuse has its mirror image in non-charismatic abuses...In some of these cases, the non-charismatic church is more guilty than the charismatic,\" such as, \"the absence of emotion, which is probably more deadly than the excesses.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Piper|first1=John|title=Piper Addresses Strange Fire and Charismatic Chaos|url=http://www.desiringgod.org/articles/piper-addresses-strange-fire-and-charismatic-chaos|publisher=Desiring God|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Complementarianism ===\nMacArthur opposes \"male [[Chauvinism|chauvinist]] and [[Feminism|feminist]] views\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gty.org/library/blog/B100902|title=The Loving Husband: A Portrait of Christ|website=www.gty.org|access-date=April 10, 2017}}</ref> with a [[complementarian]] view on [[gender role]]s and considers that the Bible does not allow women to preach to men or exercise authority in churches.

The secular discipline of psychology is based on godless assumptions and evolutionary foundations and is capable of dealing with people only superficially and only on the temporal level... Psychology is no more a science than the atheistic evolutionary theory upon which it is based. Like theistic evolution, [[Christian psychology]] is an attempt to harmonize two inherently contradictory systems of thought. Modern psychology and the Bible cannot be blended without serious compromise to or utter abandonment of the principle of Scripture's sufficiency.\"<ref>{{Citation|author=John F MacArthur|title=THE PSYCHOLOGY EPIDEMIC AND ITS CURE|journal=The Master's Seminary Journal|volume=2:1|year=1991|pages=3\u201320}}</ref>\n\nHis stance has caused several controversies, the most notable of which was the first time an employee of an [[Evangelicalism|evangelical church]] had ever been sued for malpractice.

Does he  still go to heaven? replying MacArthur to this question in a positive way, and creating this an argument and disagreement by another attendant, the dominican, reformed Calvinist (TULIP) lead-pastor of Grace Bible Church in Santo Domingo Oriental, Willy Bayonet, who replied in the same time, and after this answer by MacArthur, that a supposed christian believer who takes his life is not a true christian. In 2018, and After five years trying to convince pastor John MacArthur and his followers and associates, pastor Willy Bayonet was ready to publish his book in Spanish 'La Nobleza de Dios: Vivir o Morir' ('The Nobility of God: Living or Dying' for the English title of the book which is still being translated into English) against MacArthur's teaching about Suicidals going to heaven or 'In Suicide, Against MacArthurion,' as the author Willy Bayonet, nicknamed it. Pastor Bayonet's book is centered on the classic reformed book by William Gurnall, 'The Christian in complete Armour,' the Confession of faith of London of 1689, several reformed authors from past centuries as pastor Spurgeon, Martyn Lloyd Jones, among others, and a few contemporary reformed authors, who he says never preached or taught about suicide. Pastor MacArthur also holds his position in his ministry 'Grace to You, and with written notes online, about those who he states \"Commit Suicide and still go to Heaven.\" When pastor Willy Bayonet is asked about what he expects from pastor John MacArthur, his answer is that pastor MacArthur should stay silent about suicidals' status, as it' has been done before.\n\nIn 2019, at the Truth Matters Conference, where, during a word association questionnaire, the name, \"Beth Moore\" was given.

MacArthur stated, \"''I'm not into all that is traditionally known as dispensationalism, seven dispensations, two kingdoms, two New Covenants, two ways of salvation, discontinuity between the Old Testament and the New.''\"<ref name=\"MacArthur, John\"/>\n\n=== [[Soteriology]] ===\nMacArthur was a key person in the [[Lordship salvation controversy]] in the 1980s, arguing against [[free grace theology]]. He states, \"You must receive Jesus Christ for who He is, both Lord and Savior, to be truly saved (II Peter 2:20).\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Gospel According to Jesus |author=MacArthur, John |isbn=0-310-39491-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/gospelaccordingt00maca_0 }}</ref> Regarding [[eternal security]], he states, \"It should never be presented merely as a matter of being once saved, always saved\u2014with no regard for what you believe or do. The writer of Hebrews 12:14 states frankly that only those who continue living holy lives will enter the Lord's presence.\" MacArthur's views raised controversy within American Evangelicalism and were challenged in print by non-lordship dispensationalist theologians [[Charles Ryrie]] and [[Zane C. Hodges]], who argued that MacArthur was teaching a form of works-based salvation. MacArthur has denied the charge, as attested on two tapes recorded in 1989 when he was asked to reason together with IFCA man.<ref>https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/90-37/ifca-meeting-62689-part-2 https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/90-36/ifca-meeting-62689-part-1</ref>\n\nIn December 1989, the [[Bible Broadcasting Network]] terminated MacArthur's ''Grace to You'' program. In explaining that step, BBN president Lowell Davey referred to MacArthur's teachings on the blood of Christ and \"Lordship salvation.\" Davey called these teachings \"confusing\". In a letter dated January 15, 1990, Davey cited a \"drift by Dr. MacArthur to a theological position that we could not adhere to\" and said that MacArthur's sermon series on the theology of election \"convinced us that the direction of 'Grace to You' was toward Hyper-Calvinism.\" MacArthur preaches salvation by election of God's sovereignty.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chosen from Eternity: Chosen by God--Part 1 |author=MacArthur, John |url=http://www.gty.org/Resources/Sermons/60-2}}</ref> However, the term \"Hyper-Calvinism\" is used by some to denote 5-point Calvinism or even any strong defense of Calvinism, rather than the historical \"Hyper-Calvinism\" position denies the doctrine of duty faith. This position does not seem to accurately reflect MacArthur's position in his sermons. The controversy concerning the efficacy of Christ's blood stems from MacArthur's statement that it is not the literal liquid blood of Christ that saves, but his sacrificial death on [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], a view that he espoused in an article titled \"Not His Bleeding, but His Dying,\" published in the May 1976 issue of the ''Grace to You'' family paper distributed to his church. MacArthur himself, though, later clarified what was stated of him in the article, noting his position concerning Christ's blood and death in atonement, mentioning that the efficacy of Christ's blood is not some particular physical property of the blood itself, but the fact that He shed blood in dying, and his affirmation that Christ's blood in death was necessary to satisfy God's holy requirement for atonement.<ref>{{cite web |title=What's All the Controversy About John MacArthur and the Blood of Christ? |url=http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/articles/blood.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205235106/http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/articles/blood.htm |archivedate=December 5, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Christology ===\nIn 1983, MacArthur first published his belief in the doctrine of \"[[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnational sonship]].\" In 1989, after some criticism, he defended his views in a plenary session of the annual convention of the [[Independent Fundamental Churches of America]]. In an article on MacArthur's web site ''Grace to You'' entitled \"Reexamining the Eternal Sonship of Christ,\" he retraces his views from 1983 onward, concluding, \"I want to state publicly that I have abandoned the doctrine of 'incarnational sonship.' Careful study and reflection have brought me to understand that Scripture does indeed present the relationship between God the Father and Christ the Son as an eternal Father-Son relationship. I no longer regard Christ's sonship as a role He assumed in His incarnation.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Reexamining the Eternal Sonship of Christ |author=MacArthur, John |publisher=Grace to You |url=http://www.gty.org/Resources/Articles/593}}</ref>{{original research inline |date=March 2011}}\n\n=== Cessationism ===\n[[Image:Charismatic Chaos.jpg|thumb|widthpx|''Charismatic Chaos'' - one of the books where MacArthur argues for cessationism.]]\nMacArthur is a [[cessationism|cessationist]] and is one of the most prominent voices in the church against the [[continuationism|continuationist]] beliefs of [[Pentecostalism]] and the [[Charismatic Movement]]. He has written three books in support of his position: ''The Charismatics'' (1978), ''Charismatic Chaos'' (1993), and ''Strange Fire: The Danger of Offending the Holy Spirit with Counterfeit Worship'' (2013). In October 2013, he hosted a conference called \"Strange Fire\" at his church to mark the launch of his book of the same name. The event featured a number of speakers who argued for a cessationist theology and strongly critiqued the Charismatic Movement.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Menzie|first1=Nicola|title='Strange Fire' Conference: John MacArthur Calls Out Charismatic Movement as 'Unfaithful'|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/strange-fire-conference-john-macarthur-calls-out-charismatic-movement-as-unfaithful-106849/|website=The Christian Post|publisher=The Christian Post|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref> In his opening remarks, MacArthur stated, \"Watching the behavior of some Hindus who belong to the Kundalini cult. Their body movements are almost identical to that of people in the charismatic movement, the extreme behavior of pagans. This is the work of Satan, it is the work of darkness, and not to be attributed to the Holy Spirit\". And that, \"The Charismatic movement as such has made no contribution to biblical clarity, interpretation, or sound doctrine ... It detracts and confuses.\" \"It has only produced distortion, confusion, and error.\" \"Have people truly been saved in Charismatic churches? Yes. But nothing coming from that movement has been the reason they were saved.\" \"Evangelicalism has thrown its arms open and has welcomed the Trojan horse of the charismatic movement into the city of God.

However, he saw its interdenominational presence as being \"a testimony to the absence of any theology,\" and charged that \"its theology is both heterodox and heretical...everything is defined by experience..and therefore has a weak view of Scripture, that's the charismatic movement.\" He further criticized the modern Charismatic movement, stating that \"In 1967 a bunch of Jesus freak people in the beach areas of Southern California go to [[Calvary Chapel]]..and for the first time, the church, that I know of in history, the church lets the very defined subculture dictate what it will be.

Addressing the \"Strange Fire\" conference, continuationist [[Calvinist Baptist]] [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]] concurs that there are many abuses in the charismatic church, however he adds that \"we really need to keep in mind that every charismatic abuse has its mirror image in non-charismatic abuses...In some of these cases, the non-charismatic church is more guilty than the charismatic,\" such as, \"the absence of emotion, which is probably more deadly than the excesses.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Piper|first1=John|title=Piper Addresses Strange Fire and Charismatic Chaos|url=http://www.desiringgod.org/articles/piper-addresses-strange-fire-and-charismatic-chaos|publisher=Desiring God|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Complementarianism ===\nMacArthur opposes \"male [[Chauvinism|chauvinist]] and [[Feminism|feminist]] views\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gty.org/library/blog/B100902|title=The Loving Husband: A Portrait of Christ|website=www.gty.org|access-date=April 10, 2017}}</ref> with a [[complementarian]] view on [[gender role]]s and considers that the Bible does not allow women to preach to men or exercise authority in churches.

The secular discipline of psychology is based on godless assumptions and evolutionary foundations and is capable of dealing with people only superficially and only on the temporal level... Psychology is no more a science than the atheistic evolutionary theory upon which it is based.

Does he  still go to heaven? replying MacArthur to this question in a positive way, and creating this an argument and disagreement by another attendant, the dominican, reformed Calvinist (TULIP) lead-pastor of Grace Bible Church in Santo Domingo Oriental, Willy Bayonet, who replied in the same time, and after this answer by MacArthur, that a supposed christian believer who takes his life is not a true christian. In 2018, and After five years trying to convince pastor John MacArthur and his followers and associates, pastor Willy Bayonet was ready to publish his book in Spanish 'La Nobleza de Dios: Vivir o Morir' ('The Nobility of God: Living or Dying' for the English title of the book which is still being translated into English) against MacArthur's teaching about Suicidals going to heaven or 'In Suicide, Against MacArthurion,' as the author Willy Bayonet, nicknamed it. Pastor Bayonet's book is centered on the classic reformed book by William Gurnall, 'The Christian in complete Armour,' the Confession of faith of London of 1689, several reformed authors from past centuries as pastor Spurgeon, Martyn Lloyd Jones, among others, and a few contemporary reformed authors, who he says never preached or taught about suicide. Pastor MacArthur also holds his position in his ministry 'Grace to You, and with written notes online, about those who he states \"Commit Suicide and still go to Heaven.\" When pastor Willy Bayonet is asked about what he expects from pastor John MacArthur, his answer is that pastor MacArthur should stay silent about suicidals' status, as it' has been done before.\n\nIn 2019, at the Truth Matters Conference, where, during a word association questionnaire, the name, \"Beth Moore\" was given.

In [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003|2003]], [[Eircom]]'s telephone polling system malfunctioned. Irish broadcaster [[RT\u00c9]] did not receive the polling results from [[Eir (telecommunications)|Eircom]] in time, and substituted votes by a panel of judges.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/may/30/russia.arts|title=Vote switch 'stole Tatu's Eurovision win'|last=Nick|first=Paton Walsh|date=2003-05-30|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> Between 1997 and 2003 (the first years of televoting), lines were opened to the public for only five minutes after the performance and recap of the final song. Between 2004 and 2006 the lines were opened for 10 minutes, and from 2007 to 2009 they were opened for 15 minutes. In 2010 viewers were allowed to vote during the performances, but this was rescinded for the 2012 contest. Since the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006]] contest, the presenters use a special phrase to start the televoting process known as \"Europe, start voting now!\". This also applies to [[Australia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Australia]] since [[Eurovision Song Contest 2015|2015]]. When everything is all done, \"Europe, stop voting now!\" is used to signal the end of the process.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nThe [[BBC]] contacted regional juries by telephone to choose the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1956|1956]] winners, and the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (producers of the contest) later began contacting international juries by telephone. This method continued to be used until 1993. The following year saw the first satellite linkup to juries.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nTo announce the votes, the contest's [[List of Eurovision Song Contest presenters|presenters]] connect by satellite to each country in turn and inviting a spokesperson to read the country's votes in [[French language|French]] or [[English language|English]]. The presenters originally repeated the votes in both languages, but since [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004|2004]] the votes have been translated due to time constraints. To offset increased voting time required by a larger number of participating countries, since 2006 only countries' eight-, 10-, and 12-point scores are read aloud; one- to seven-point votes are added automatically to the scoreboard while each country's spokesperson is introduced. The scoreboard displays the number of points each country has received and, since [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008]], a progress bar indicating the number of countries which have voted. Since [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016|2016]], only the 12-point score is read aloud due to the new voting system, meaning that the nine scoring countries were added automatically to the scoreboard (1-8 and 10 points). In addition, the televoting points are combined together and the presenters announce them in order, starting from the country with the lowest score and ending with the country with the highest score from the televoting. For the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2019|2019]] contest the system is the same as before but this time, the presenters will announce the televoting points based on the juries' rankings.\n\n==Voting systems==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=\"75\"| Year !! width=\"110\"| Points !!

This system was used from 1957 to 1961 and from 1967 to 1969. Ten jurors in each country each cast one vote for their favourite song. In 1969 this resulted in a four-way tie for first place (between the UK, the Netherlands, France, and Spain), with no tie-breaking procedure. A second round of voting in the event of a tie was introduced to this system the following year.\n\nFrom 1962 to 1966, a voting system similar to the current one was used. In 1962, each country awarded its top three one, two and three points; in 1963 the top five were awarded one, two, three, four and five points, and from 1964 to 1966, each country usually awarded its top three one, three and five points. With the latter system, a country could choose to give points to two countries instead of three (giving three to one and six to the other); in 1965, Belgium awarded the United Kingdom six points and Italy three. Although it was possible to give one country nine points, this never occurred.\n\nThe [[Eurovision Song Contest 1971|1971]], [[Eurovision Song Contest 1972|1972]], and [[Eurovision Song Contest 1973|1973]] contests saw the jurors \"in vision\" for the first time. Each country was represented by two jurors: one older than 25 and one younger, with at least ten years' difference in their ages. Each juror gave a minimum of one point and a maximum of five points to each song. In [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974|1974]] the previous system of ten jurors was used, and the following year the current system was introduced. Spokespeople were next seen on screen in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1994|1994]] with a satellite link to the venue.\n\nThe [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004|2004]] contest had its first semifinal, with a slight change in voting: countries which did not qualify from the semifinal would be allowed to cast votes in the final. This resulted in Ukraine's [[Ruslana]] finishing first, with a record 280 points. If the voting had been conducted as it had been from 1956 to 2003 (when only finalist countries could vote), [[Serbia and Montenegro]]'s [[\u017deljko Joksimovi\u0107]] would have won the contest with 190 points: a 15-point lead over Ruslana, who would have scored 175 points. To date, non-qualifying countries are still allowed to vote in the final. In 2006, Serbia and Montenegro were able to vote in the semifinal and the final despite their non-participation due to a [[Evropesma#2006 event and controversy|scandal in the selection process]] (which resulted in [[Macedonia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2006|Macedonia]] entering the final instead of [[Poland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2006|Poland]]).\n\nWith the introduction of two semifinals in 2008, a new method of selecting finalists was created. The top nine songs (ranked by televote) qualified, along with one song selected by the back-up juries. This method, in most cases, meant that the tenth song in the televoting failed to qualify; this attracted some criticism, especially from [[North Macedonia|Macedonia]] (who had placed 10th in the televote in both years).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/14111|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521220118/http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/14111|url-status=dead|archive-date=2009-05-21|title=FYR Macedonia threatens Eurovision withdrawal|last=Viniker|first=Barry|date=2009-05-20|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=24 January 2010}}</ref> In 2010 the 2009 final system was used, with a combination of televoting and jury votes from each country also used to select the semi-finalists.<ref name=\"2010 voting\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=4533&_t=Exclusive%3A+Juries+also+get+50%25+stake+in+Semi-Final+result!|title=Exclusive: Juries also get 50% stake in Semi-Final result!|last=Bakker|first=Sietse|date=2009-10-11|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]]|accessdate=2009-10-11}}</ref> Each participating country had a national jury, consisting of five music-industry professionals<ref name=\"VotingWindow\">{{cite web|last=Bakker|first=Sietse|title=EBU restores televoting window as from 2012|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=37013&_t=ebu_restores_televoting_window_as_from_2012|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=4 July 2011|date=22 January 2015}}</ref> appointed by national broadcasters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/press-downloads/2015/2014-09-02_2015_ESC_rules_EN_PUBLIC_RULES.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430201605/http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/press-downloads/2015/2014-09-02_2015_ESC_rules_EN_PUBLIC_RULES.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-30 }} read 2015-05-20</ref>\n\n== Highest scores ==\n\"[[A Million Voices (song)|A Million Voices]]\" sung by Russian artist [[Polina Gagarina]], became the first song to get over 300 points without winning the contest (and the only one during the era when each country delivered only one set of points); with a new voting system introduced in 2016, Australia became the first country to get over 500 points without winning the contest. In 2017, Bulgaria became the first non-winning country to score above 600 points, as well as Portugal becoming the first country to get over 750 points - winning the contest as a result of this with the song \"Amar pelos dois\" by Salvador Sobral.

With no tie-breaking system in place at the time, it was determined that all four countries would be awarded the title; in protest, Austria, Finland, Sweden, Norway and Portugal did not participate the following year.\n\nThe current tie-break procedure was implemented in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016|2016 contest]]. In the procedure, sometimes known as a [[Issues affecting the single transferable vote#Countback|countback]], if two (or more) countries tie, the song receiving more points from the televote is the winner. If the songs received the same number of televote points, the song that received at least one televote point from the greatest number of countries is the winner. If there is still a tie, a second tie-breaker counts the number of countries who assigned twelve televote points to each entry in the tie. Tie-breaks continue with ten points, eight points, and so on until the tie is resolved. If the tie cannot be resolved after the number of countries which assigned one point to the song is equal, the song performed earlier in the running order is declared the winner, unless the host country performed earlier (in which case the song performed later would be the winner). The tie-break procedure originally applied only to first place ties,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/press-downloads/2015/2014-09-02_2015_ESC_rules_EN_PUBLIC_RULES.pdf|title=Public rules of the 60th Eurovision Song Contest|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=1 June 2015|format=PDF|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430201605/http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/press-downloads/2015/2014-09-02_2015_ESC_rules_EN_PUBLIC_RULES.pdf|archivedate=30 April 2015}}</ref> but since 2008 has been applied to all places.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=1469 |work=Eurovision.tv |title=Eurovision 2008 Final |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Eurovision Song Contest 1991|1991]], the tie-break procedure was implemented when [[Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest|Sweden]] and France both had 146 points at the end of the voting. At the time, there was no televoting system, and the tie-break rule was slightly different; the first tie-break rule at the time concerned the number of 12 points each country had received.<ref>http://www.myledbury.co.uk/eurovision/pdf/esc2002.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.myledbury.co.uk/eurovision/pdf/esc2003.pdf</ref> Both Sweden and France had received the maximum twelve points four times; when the number of ten-point scores was counted Sweden, represented by [[Carola H\u00e4ggkvist|Carola]] and \"[[F\u00e5ngad av en stormvind]]\", claimed its third victory since it received five ten-point scores against France's two.

When a country finishes with a score of zero, it is often referred to in English-language media as ''nul points'' or ''nil points'', albeit incorrectly. Grammatical French for \"no points\" is ''pas de points'' or ''z\u00e9ro point'', but none of these phrases are used in the contest; before 2016's voting overhaul, no-point scores were not announced by the presenters. Following the change in the voting system, a country receiving no points from the public voting is announced as receiving \"zero points\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://adriankavanagh.com/2016/05/13/2016-eurovision-final-results-estimate-or-televote-estimate-to-russia-with-love-or-going-to-a-land-down-under/|title=2016 Eurovision Final results estimate (or televote estimate!): To Russia with Love or Going to a Land Down Under?|author=Adrian Kavanagh|date=May 13, 2016|access-date=January 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|Pre 1975}}Before 1975===\nEntries which received no points before the introduction of the scoring system introduced in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1975|1975]] are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Contest !!

This methodology also allows for a sliding time window to accumulate a degree of collusion over the years producing a weighted network. The previous results are supported and the changes over time provide insight into the collusive behaviours given more or less choice.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Kids Jury in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Eurovision years}}\n\n[[Category:Eurovision Song Contest]]\n[[Category:Voting]]\n", "text_old": "The winner of the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] is selected by a [[positional voting system]].

Irish broadcaster [[RT\u00c9]] did not receive the polling results from [[Eir (telecommunications)|Eircom]] in time, and substituted votes by a panel of judges.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/may/30/russia.arts|title=Vote switch 'stole Tatu's Eurovision win'|last=Nick|first=Paton Walsh|date=2003-05-30|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> Between 1997 and 2003 (the first years of televoting), lines were opened to the public for only five minutes after the performance and recap of the final song. Between 2004 and 2006 the lines were opened for 10 minutes, and from 2007 to 2009 they were opened for 15 minutes. In 2010 viewers were allowed to vote during the performances, but this was rescinded for the 2012 contest. Since the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006]] contest, the presenters use a special phrase to start the televoting process known as \"Europe, start voting now!\". This also applies to [[Australia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Australia]] since [[Eurovision Song Contest 2015|2015]]. When everything is all done, \"Europe, stop voting now!\" is used to signal the end of the process.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nThe [[BBC]] contacted regional juries by telephone to choose the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1956|1956]] winners, and the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (producers of the contest) later began contacting international juries by telephone. This method continued to be used until 1993. The following year saw the first satellite linkup to juries.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nTo announce the votes, the contest's [[List of Eurovision Song Contest presenters|presenters]] connect by satellite to each country in turn and inviting a spokesperson to read the country's votes in [[French language|French]] or [[English language|English]]. The presenters originally repeated the votes in both languages, but since [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004|2004]] the votes have been translated due to time constraints. To offset increased voting time required by a larger number of participating countries, since 2006 only countries' eight-, 10-, and 12-point scores are read aloud; one- to seven-point votes are added automatically to the scoreboard while each country's spokesperson is introduced. The scoreboard displays the number of points each country has received and, since [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008]], a progress bar indicating the number of countries which have voted. Since [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016|2016]], only the 12-point score is read aloud due to the new voting system, meaning that the nine scoring countries were added automatically to the scoreboard (1-8 and 10 points). In addition, the televoting points are combined together and the presenters announce them in order, starting from the country with the lowest score and ending with the country with the highest score from the televoting. For the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2019|2019]] contest the system is the same as before but this time, the presenters will announce the televoting points based on the juries' rankings.\n\n==Voting systems==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=\"75\"| Year !! width=\"110\"| Points !!

This system was used from 1957 to 1961 and from 1967 to 1969. Ten jurors in each country each cast one vote for their favourite song. In 1969 this resulted in a four-way tie for first place (between the UK, the Netherlands, France, and Spain), with no tie-breaking procedure. A second round of voting in the event of a tie was introduced to this system the following year.\n\nFrom 1962 to 1966, a voting system similar to the current one was used. In 1962, each country awarded its top three one, two and three points; in 1963 the top five were awarded one, two, three, four and five points, and from 1964 to 1966, each country usually awarded its top three one, three and five points. With the latter system, a country could choose to give points to two countries instead of three (giving three to one and six to the other); in 1965, Belgium awarded the United Kingdom six points and Italy three. Although it was possible to give one country nine points, this never occurred.\n\nThe [[Eurovision Song Contest 1971|1971]], [[Eurovision Song Contest 1972|1972]], and [[Eurovision Song Contest 1973|1973]] contests saw the jurors \"in vision\" for the first time. Each country was represented by two jurors: one older than 25 and one younger, with at least ten years' difference in their ages. Each juror gave a minimum of one point and a maximum of five points to each song. In [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974|1974]] the previous system of ten jurors was used, and the following year the current system was introduced. Spokespeople were next seen on screen in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1994|1994]] with a satellite link to the venue.\n\nThe [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004|2004]] contest had its first semifinal, with a slight change in voting: countries which did not qualify from the semifinal would be allowed to cast votes in the final. This resulted in Ukraine's [[Ruslana]] finishing first, with a record 280 points. If the voting had been conducted as it had been from 1956 to 2003 (when only finalist countries could vote), [[Serbia and Montenegro]]'s [[\u017deljko Joksimovi\u0107]] would have won the contest with 190 points: a 15-point lead over Ruslana, who would have scored 175 points. To date, non-qualifying countries are still allowed to vote in the final. In 2006, Serbia and Montenegro were able to vote in the semifinal and the final despite their non-participation due to a [[Evropesma#2006 event and controversy|scandal in the selection process]] (which resulted in [[Macedonia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2006|Macedonia]] entering the final instead of [[Poland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2006|Poland]]).\n\nWith the introduction of two semifinals in 2008, a new method of selecting finalists was created. The top nine songs (ranked by televote) qualified, along with one song selected by the back-up juries. This method, in most cases, meant that the tenth song in the televoting failed to qualify; this attracted some criticism, especially from [[North Macedonia|Macedonia]] (who had placed 10th in the televote in both years).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/14111|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521220118/http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/14111|url-status=dead|archive-date=2009-05-21|title=FYR Macedonia threatens Eurovision withdrawal|last=Viniker|first=Barry|date=2009-05-20|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=24 January 2010}}</ref> In 2010 the 2009 final system was used, with a combination of televoting and jury votes from each country also used to select the semi-finalists.<ref name=\"2010 voting\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=4533&_t=Exclusive%3A+Juries+also+get+50%25+stake+in+Semi-Final+result!|title=Exclusive: Juries also get 50% stake in Semi-Final result!|last=Bakker|first=Sietse|date=2009-10-11|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]]|accessdate=2009-10-11}}</ref> Each participating country had a national jury, consisting of five music-industry professionals<ref name=\"VotingWindow\">{{cite web|last=Bakker|first=Sietse|title=EBU restores televoting window as from 2012|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=37013&_t=ebu_restores_televoting_window_as_from_2012|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=4 July 2011|date=22 January 2015}}</ref> appointed by national broadcasters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/press-downloads/2015/2014-09-02_2015_ESC_rules_EN_PUBLIC_RULES.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430201605/http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/press-downloads/2015/2014-09-02_2015_ESC_rules_EN_PUBLIC_RULES.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-30 }} read 2015-05-20</ref>\n\n== Highest scores ==\n\"[[A Million Voices (song)|A Million Voices]]\" sung by Russian artist [[Polina Gagarina]], became the first song to get over 300 points without winning the contest (and the only one during the era when each country delivered only one set of points); with a new voting system introduced in 2016, Australia became the first country to get over 500 points without winning the contest.

With no tie-breaking system in place at the time, it was determined that all four countries would be awarded the title; in protest, Austria, Finland, Sweden, Norway and Portugal did not participate the following year.\n\nThe current tie-break procedure was implemented in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016|2016 contest]]. In the procedure, sometimes known as a [[Issues affecting the single transferable vote#Countback|countback]], if two (or more) countries tie, the song receiving more points from the televote is the winner. If the songs received the same number of televote points, the song that received at least one televote point from the greatest number of countries is the winner. If there is still a tie, a second tie-breaker counts the number of countries who assigned twelve televote points to each entry in the tie. Tie-breaks continue with ten points, eight points, and so on until the tie is resolved. If the tie cannot be resolved after the number of countries which assigned one point to the song is equal, the song performed earlier in the running order is declared the winner, unless the host country performed earlier (in which case the song performed later would be the winner). The tie-break procedure originally applied only to first place ties,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/press-downloads/2015/2014-09-02_2015_ESC_rules_EN_PUBLIC_RULES.pdf|title=Public rules of the 60th Eurovision Song Contest|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=1 June 2015|format=PDF|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430201605/http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/press-downloads/2015/2014-09-02_2015_ESC_rules_EN_PUBLIC_RULES.pdf|archivedate=30 April 2015}}</ref> but since 2008 has been applied to all places.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=1469 |work=Eurovision.tv |title=Eurovision 2008 Final |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Eurovision Song Contest 1991|1991]], the tie-break procedure was implemented when [[Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest|Sweden]] and France both had 146 points at the end of the voting. At the time, there was no televoting system, and the tie-break rule was slightly different; the first tie-break rule at the time concerned the number of 12 points each country had received.<ref>http://www.myledbury.co.uk/eurovision/pdf/esc2002.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.myledbury.co.uk/eurovision/pdf/esc2003.pdf</ref> Both Sweden and France had received the maximum twelve points four times; when the number of ten-point scores was counted Sweden, represented by [[Carola H\u00e4ggkvist|Carola]] and \"[[F\u00e5ngad av en stormvind]]\", claimed its third victory since it received five ten-point scores against France's two.

When a country finishes with a score of zero, it is often referred to in English-language media as ''nul points'' or ''nil points'', albeit incorrectly. Grammatical French for \"no points\" is ''pas de points'' or ''z\u00e9ro point'', but none of these phrases are used in the contest; before 2016's voting overhaul, no-point scores were not announced by the presenters. Following the change in the voting system, a country receiving no points from the public voting is announced as receiving \"zero points\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://adriankavanagh.com/2016/05/13/2016-eurovision-final-results-estimate-or-televote-estimate-to-russia-with-love-or-going-to-a-land-down-under/|title=2016 Eurovision Final results estimate (or televote estimate!): To Russia with Love or Going to a Land Down Under?|author=Adrian Kavanagh|date=May 13, 2016|access-date=January 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|Pre 1975}}Before 1975===\nEntries which received no points before the introduction of the scoring system introduced in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1975|1975]] are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Contest !!

The voting patterns change and the previous studies restrained their analysis to a particular time window where the voting scheme is homogeneous and this approach allows the sampling comparison over arbitrary periods consistent with the unbiased assumption of voting patterns. This methodology also allows for a sliding time window to accumulate a degree of collusion over the years producing a weighted network. The previous results are supported and the changes over time provide insight into the collusive behaviours given more or less choice.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Eurovision Song Contest jurors]]\n* [[Kids Jury in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Eurovision years}}\n\n[[Category:Eurovision Song Contest]]\n[[Category:Voting]]\n", "name_user": "GoodCrossing", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSee also:Removed deleted wikilink", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_at_the_Eurovision_Song_Contest"}

He is best known for playing the lead in ''[[Johnny Got His Gun (film)|Johnny Got His Gun]]''; Sonny Crawford in ''[[The Last Picture Show]]'' where he and his fellow co-stars, [[Cybill Shepherd]] and [[Jeff Bridges]], rose to fame; as James Hart, the first-year law student who battles with Prof. Kingsfield, in the film adaptation ''[[The Paper Chase (film)|The Paper Chase]]''; and for playing President [[George W. Bush]] multiple times, including on the [[sitcom]] ''[[That's My Bush!]]'' and in the comedy film ''[[The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course]]'' and the [[docudrama]] ''[[DC 9/11: Time of Crisis]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nBottoms was born in [[Santa Barbara, California]], the eldest of four sons of Betty ([[married and maiden names|n\u00e9e]] Chapman) and James \"Bud\" Bottoms, who is a sculptor and art teacher. \n\nHe is the eldest brother of actors [[Joseph Bottoms]] (born 1954), [[Sam Bottoms]] (1955\u20132008) and [[Ben Bottoms]] (born 1960). In 1967, Bottoms toured [[Europe]] as part of the Santa Barbara Madrigal Society.\n\nSam Bottoms died from brain cancer in 2008.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nndb.com/people/379/000173857/|title=Sam Bottoms| website=[[NNDB]]| accessdate=30 May 2017}}</ref> At one point, Sam was the only sibling close to Timothy.<ref name=people/> \n\nBottoms married twice.  His first marriage to folksinger Alicia Cory in 1975 produced one son Bartholomew, before ending in divorce in 1978.  His second marriage to Marcia Moreheart in 1984 produced three children:  Bodie, Bridget, and Benton.<ref name=people/>\n\n==Career==\nBottoms made his film debut in 1971 as Joe Bonham in [[Dalton Trumbo]]'s ''[[Johnny Got His Gun (film)|Johnny Got His Gun]]''. The same year, he appeared alongside his brother Sam in ''[[The Last Picture Show]]''. (He portrayed the same character in the 1990 sequel ''[[Texasville]]''). In 1973's [[The Paper Chase (film)|''The Paper Chase'']], he starred as [[Harvard]] law student Hart facing the fearsome Professor Kingsfield ([[John Houseman]]).  Among the other films he has appeared in are ''[[Love and Pain and the Whole Damn Thing]] ''(1973), ''[[The Crazy World of Julius Vrooder]]'' (1974), ''[[Operation Daybreak]]'' (1975), ''[[A Small Town in Texas]]'' (1976), ''[[Rollercoaster (1977 film)|Rollercoaster]]'' (1977) ''[[Hurricane (1979 film)|Hurricane]]'' (1979), ''[[Invaders from Mars (1986 film)|Invaders from Mars]]'' (1986) and ''[[Elephant (2003 film)|Elephant]] ''(2003).\n\nBottoms has portrayed [[U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]] in three widely varying productions. In 2000\u20132001, he played a parody of Bush in the [[Comedy Central]] [[sitcom]] ''[[That's My Bush!]]''; he subsequently appeared as Bush in a cameo appearance in the family film ''[[The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course]]''. Finally, following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], Bottoms once again played Bush, this time in a serious fashion, in the telefilm ''[[DC 9/11]]'', one of the first movies to be based upon the attacks.\n\nDuring an episode of the Fox television show ''[[That '70s Show]]'' in which a [[tornado]] warning has been issued and the students of the high school are trapped, Bottoms is seen as the panicking principal. He appeared in a recurring role during the first season of the [[FX Network|FX]] series ''[[Dirt (TV series)|Dirt]]'' as Gibson Horne, who owned the magazine that series main character [[Lucy Spiller]] worked for.\n\nHe also co-produced the documentary ''Picture This \u2013 The Times of Peter Bogdanovich in Archer City, Texas'' (1991), a behind-the-scenes work about the making of the films ''The Last Picture Show'' and ''Texasville''. In the documentary, he revealed that he had a crush on his co-star [[Cybill Shepherd]] during ''The Last Picture Show,'' but she did not reciprocate his romantic feelings, even though she said in a separate interview that she found him \"very attractive\".<ref>{{cite magazine| url=http://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/picture-perfect-2/| title=Picture Perfect| date=February 1999| magazine=[[Texas Monthly]]| accessdate=30 May 2017}}</ref> He was also heavily featured in the [[Metallica]] video for \"[[one (Metallica song)|One]]\", which featured footage of the film ''Johnny Got His Gun''.\n\n==Filmography==\n===Film===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* ''[[Johnny Got His Gun (film)|Johnny Got His Gun]]'' (1971) as Joe Bonham\n* ''[[The Last Picture Show]]'' (1971) as Sonny Crawford\n* ''[[Love and Pain and the Whole Damn Thing]]'' (1973) as Walter Elbertson\n* ''[[The Paper Chase (film)|The Paper Chase]]'' (1973) as Hart\n* ''[[The White Dawn]]'' (1974) as Daggett\n* ''[[The Crazy World of Julius Vrooder]]'' (1974) as Vrooder\n* ''[[Operation Daybreak]]'' (1975) as Jan Kubis\n* ''[[A Small Town in Texas]]'' (1976) as Poke Jackson\n* ''[[Rollercoaster (1977 film)|Rollercoaster]]'' (1977) as Young Man\n* ''[[The Other Side of the Mountain Part 2]]'' (1978) as John Boothe\n* ''[[Hurricane (1979 film)|Hurricane]]'' (1979) as Jack Sanford\n* ''[[The High Country]]'' (1981) as Jim\n* ''[[Tin Man (1983 film)|Tin Man]]'' (1983) as Casey\n* ''[[Hambone and Hillie]]'' (1983) as Michael Radcliffe\n* ''[[The Census Taker]]'' (1984) as Pete\n* ''[[What Waits Below]]'' (1984) as Maj.

He is best known for playing the lead in ''[[Johnny Got His Gun (film)|Johnny Got His Gun]]''; Sonny Crawford in ''[[The Last Picture Show]]'' where he and his fellow co-stars, [[Cybill Shepherd]] and [[Jeff Bridges]], rose to fame; as James Hart, the first-year law student who battles with Prof. Kingsfield, in the film adaptation ''[[The Paper Chase (film)|The Paper Chase]]''; and for playing President [[George W. Bush]] multiple times, including on the [[sitcom]] ''[[That's My Bush!]]'' and in the comedy film ''[[The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course]]'' and the [[docudrama]] ''[[DC 9/11: Time of Crisis]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nBottoms was born in [[Santa Barbara, California]], the eldest of four sons of Betty ([[married and maiden names|n\u00e9e]] Chapman) and James \"Bud\" Bottoms, who is a sculptor and art teacher. \n\nHe is the eldest brother of actors [[Joseph Bottoms]] (born 1954), [[Sam Bottoms]] (1955\u20132008) and [[Ben Bottoms]] (born 1960). In 1967, Bottoms toured [[Europe]] as part of the Santa Barbara Madrigal Society.\n\nSam Bottoms died from brain cancer in 2008.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nndb.com/people/379/000173857/|title=Sam Bottoms| website=[[NNDB]]| accessdate=30 May 2017}}</ref> At one point, Sam was the only sibling close to Timothy.<ref name=people/> \n\nBottoms married twice.  His first marriage to folksinger Alicia Cory in 1975 produced one son Bartholomew, before ending in divorce in 1978.  His second marriage to Marcia Moreheart in 1984 produced three children:  Bodie, Bridget, and Benton.<ref name=people/>\n\n==Career==\nBottoms made his film debut in 1971 as Joe Bonham in [[Dalton Trumbo]]'s ''[[Johnny Got His Gun (film)|Johnny Got His Gun]]''. The same year, he appeared alongside his brother Sam in ''[[The Last Picture Show]]''. (He portrayed the same character in the 1990 sequel ''[[Texasville]]''). In 1973's [[The Paper Chase (film)|''The Paper Chase'']], he starred as [[Harvard]] law student Hart facing the fearsome Professor Kingsfield ([[John Houseman]]).  Among the other films he has appeared in are ''[[Love and Pain and the Whole Damn Thing]] ''(1973), ''[[The Crazy World of Julius Vrooder]]'' (1974), ''[[Operation Daybreak]]'' (1975), ''[[A Small Town in Texas]]'' (1976), ''[[Rollercoaster (1977 film)|Rollercoaster]]'' (1977) ''[[Hurricane (1979 film)|Hurricane]]'' (1979), ''[[Invaders from Mars (1986 film)|Invaders from Mars]]'' (1986) and ''[[Elephant (2003 film)|Elephant]] ''(2003).\n\nBottoms has portrayed [[U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]] in three widely varying productions. In 2000\u20132001, he played a parody of Bush in the [[Comedy Central]] [[sitcom]] ''[[That's My Bush!]]''; he subsequently appeared as Bush in a cameo appearance in the family film ''[[The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course]]''. Finally, following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], Bottoms once again played Bush, this time in a serious fashion, in the telefilm ''[[DC 9/11]]'', one of the first movies to be based upon the attacks.\n\nDuring an episode of the Fox television show ''[[That '70s Show]]'' in which a [[tornado]] warning has been issued and the students of the high school are trapped, Bottoms is seen as the panicking principal. He appeared in a recurring role during the first season of the [[FX Network|FX]] series ''[[Dirt (TV series)|Dirt]]'' as Gibson Horne, who owned the magazine that series main character [[Lucy Spiller]] worked for.\n\nHe also co-produced the documentary ''Picture This \u2013 The Times of Peter Bogdanovich in Archer City, Texas'' (1991), a behind-the-scenes work about the making of the films ''The Last Picture Show'' and ''Texasville''. In the documentary, he revealed that he had a crush on his co-star [[Cybill Shepherd]] during ''The Last Picture Show,'' but she did not reciprocate his romantic feelings, even though she said in a separate interview that she found him \"very attractive\".<ref>{{cite magazine| url=http://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/picture-perfect-2/| title=Picture Perfect| date=February 1999| magazine=[[Texas Monthly]]| accessdate=30 May 2017}}</ref> He was also heavily featured in the [[Metallica]] video for \"[[one (Metallica song)|One]]\", which featured footage of the film ''Johnny Got His Gun''.\n\n==Filmography==\n===Film===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* ''[[Johnny Got His Gun (film)|Johnny Got His Gun]]'' (1971) as Joe Bonham\n* ''[[The Last Picture Show]]'' (1971) as Sonny Crawford\n* ''[[Love and Pain and the Whole Damn Thing]]'' (1973) as Walter Elbertson\n* ''[[The Paper Chase (film)|The Paper Chase]]'' (1973) as Hart\n* ''[[The White Dawn]]'' (1974) as Daggett\n* ''[[The Crazy World of Julius Vrooder]]'' (1974) as Vrooder\n* ''[[Operation Daybreak]]'' (1975) as Jan Kubis\n* ''[[A Small Town in Texas]]'' (1976) as Poke Jackson\n* ''[[Rollercoaster (1977 film)|Rollercoaster]]'' (1977) as Young Man\n* ''[[The Other Side of the Mountain Part 2]]'' (1978) as John Boothe\n* ''[[Hurricane (1979 film)|Hurricane]]'' (1979) as Jack Sanford\n* ''[[The High Country]]'' (1981) as Jim\n* ''[[Tin Man (1983 film)|Tin Man]]'' (1983) as Casey\n* ''[[Hambone and Hillie]]'' (1983) as Michael Radcliffe\n* ''[[The Census Taker]]'' (1984) as Pete\n* ''[[What Waits Below]]'' (1984) as Maj.

It set a record for the [[Long-running musical theatre productions|longest run]] of any show on Broadway up to that time. It was followed by a hit London production, a popular [[My Fair Lady (film)|film version]], and many revivals.  ''My Fair Lady'' has been called \"the perfect musical\".<ref>See, e.g., Steyn, Mark.

The noted [[phonetics|phonetician]] Professor Henry Higgins encounters Eliza at [[Covent Garden]] and laments the vulgarity of her dialect (\"Why Can't the English?\"). Higgins also meets Colonel Pickering, another linguist, and invites him to stay as his houseguest. Eliza and her friends wonder what it would be like to live a comfortable life (\"[[Wouldn't It Be Loverly]]?\").\n\nEliza's father, Alfred P. Doolittle, stops by the next morning searching for money for a drink (\"[[With a Little Bit of Luck]]\"). Soon after, Eliza comes to Higgins's house, seeking [[elocution]] lessons so that she can get a job as an assistant in a florist's shop. Higgins wagers Pickering that, within six months, by teaching Eliza to speak properly, he will enable her to pass for a proper lady.\n\nEliza becomes part of Higgins's household. Though Higgins sees himself as a kindhearted man who merely cannot get along with women (\"I'm an Ordinary Man\"), to others he appears self-absorbed and [[misogynistic]]. Eliza endures Higgins's tyrannical speech tutoring. Frustrated, she dreams of different ways to kill him (\"Just You Wait\" incidentally, when she sings, \"One day I'll be famous, I'll be proper and prim\nGo to St. James so often I will call it St. Jim\", she is not referring to a church called St James, but the St James Palace, where the King and Queen live, and hence the King asks what she would like, and all she \"wants is 'Enry 'Iggin's 'ead\"). Higgins's servants lament the stressful atmosphere (\"The Servants' Chorus\"). \n\nJust as Higgins is about to give up on her, Eliza suddenly recites one of her diction exercises in perfect upper-class style (\"[[The Rain in Spain]]\"). Though Mrs Pearce, the housekeeper, insists that Eliza go to bed, she declares she is too excited to sleep (\"[[I Could Have Danced All Night]]\").\n\nFor her first public tryout, Higgins takes Eliza to his mother's box at [[Ascot Racecourse]] (\"Ascot Gavotte\"). Though Eliza shocks everyone when she forgets herself while watching a race and reverts to foul language, she does capture the heart of Freddy Eynsford-Hill. Freddy calls on Eliza that evening, and he declares that he will wait for her in the street outside Higgins' house (\"[[On the Street Where You Live]]\").\n\nEliza's final test requires her to pass as a lady at the Embassy Ball. After more weeks of preparation, she is ready. All the ladies and gentlemen at the ball admire her, and the Queen of [[Transylvania]] invites her to dance with the prince (\"Embassy Waltz\"). A Hungarian phonetician, Zoltan Karpathy, attempts to discover Eliza's origins. Higgins allows Karpathy to dance with Eliza.\n\n===Act II===\nThe ball is a success; Karpathy has declared Eliza to be a Hungarian princess. Pickering and Higgins revel in their triumph (\"You Did It\"), failing to pay attention to Eliza. Eliza is insulted at receiving no credit for her success, packing up and leaving the Higgins house. As she leaves she finds Freddy, who begins to tell her how much he loves her, but she tells him that she has heard enough words; if he really loves her, he should show it (\"Show Me\"). \n\nEliza and Freddy return to Covent Garden but she finds she no longer feels at home there. Her father is there as well, and he tells her that he has received a surprise bequest from an American millionaire, which has raised him to middle-class respectability, and now must marry his lover. Doolittle and his friends have one last spree before the wedding (\"[[Get Me to the Church on Time]]\").\n\nHiggins awakens the next morning. He finds himself out of sorts without Eliza. He wonders why she left after the triumph at the ball and concludes that men (especially himself) are far superior to women (\"A Hymn to Him\"). Pickering notices the Professor's lack of consideration, and also leaves the Higgins house.\n\nHiggins despondently visits his mother's house, where he finds Eliza. Eliza declares she no longer needs Higgins (\"Without You\"). As Higgins walks home, he realizes he's grown attached to Eliza (\"[[I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face]]\"). At home, he sentimentally reviews the recording he made the day Eliza first came to him for lessons, hearing his own harsh words. Eliza suddenly appears in his home. In suppressed joy at their reunion, Professor Higgins scoffs and asks, \"Eliza, where the devil are my slippers?\"\n\n==Characters and original Broadway cast==\nThe original cast of the Broadway stage production:<ref name=guide>[http://guidetomusicaltheatre.com/shows_m/my_fair_lady.htm \"'My Fair Lady' Synopsis, Cast, Scenes and Settings and Musical Numbers\"] guidetomusicaltheatre.com, accessed December 7, 2011.</ref>\n\n* [[Eliza Doolittle]], a young Cockney flowerseller \u2013 [[Julie Andrews]] \n* Henry Higgins, a professor of [[phonetics]] \u2013 [[Rex Harrison]]\n* Alfred P.

However, Shaw, having had a bad experience with ''[[The Chocolate Soldier]]'', a Viennese operetta based on his play ''[[Arms and the Man]]'', refused permission for ''Pygmalion'' to be adapted into a musical. After Shaw died in 1950, Pascal asked lyricist [[Alan Jay Lerner]] to write the musical adaptation. Lerner agreed, and he and his partner [[Frederick Loewe]] began work. But they quickly realised that the play violated several key rules for constructing a musical: the main story was not a love story, there was no subplot or secondary love story, and there was no place for an ensemble.<ref>Lerner, p. 36.</ref> Many people, including [[Oscar Hammerstein II]], who, with [[Richard Rodgers]], had also tried his hand at adapting ''Pygmalion'' into a musical and had given up, told Lerner that converting the play to a musical was impossible, so he and Loewe abandoned the project for two years.<ref>Lerner, p. 38.</ref>\n\nDuring this time, the collaborators separated and Gabriel Pascal died. Lerner had been trying to musicalize ''[[Li'l Abner]]'' when he read Pascal's obituary and found himself thinking about ''Pygmalion'' again.<ref>Lerner, p. 39.</ref> When he and Loewe reunited, everything fell into place. All of the insurmountable obstacles that had stood in their way two years earlier disappeared when the team realised that the play needed few changes apart from (according to Lerner) \"adding the action that took place between the acts of the play\".<ref>Lerner, pp. 43\u201344.</ref> They then excitedly began writing the show. However, [[Chase Manhattan Bank]] was in charge of Pascal's estate, and the musical rights to ''Pygmalion'' were sought both by Lerner and Loewe and by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], whose executives called Lerner to discourage him from challenging the studio. Loewe said, \"We will write the show without the rights, and when the time comes for them to decide who is to get them, we will be so far ahead of everyone else that they will be forced to give them to us.\"<ref>Lerner, p. 47.</ref> For five months Lerner and Loewe wrote, hired technical designers, and made casting decisions. The bank, in the end, granted them the musical rights.\n\nLerner settled on the title ''My Fair Lady'', relating both to one of Shaw's provisional titles for ''Pygmalion'', ''Fair Eliza'', and to the final line of every verse of the nursery rhyme \"[[London Bridge Is Falling Down]]\".  Recalling that the Gershwins' 1925 musical ''Tell Me More'' had been titled ''My Fair Lady'' in its out-of-town tryout, and also had a musical number under that title, Lerner made a courtesy call to Ira Gershwin, alerting him to the use of the title for the Lerner and Loewe musical.{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\n[[No\u00ebl Coward]] was the first to be offered the role of Henry Higgins, but he turned it down, suggesting the producers cast [[Rex Harrison]] instead.<ref>Morley, Sheridan.

Coming at the height of [[Cold War]] tensions, just weeks after the closing of the East Berlin\u2013West Berlin border and the erection of the [[Berlin Wall]], this was the first staging of a Broadway musical in Berlin since [[World War II]]. As such it was seen as a symbol of West Berlin's cultural renaissance and resistance. Lost attendance from East Berlin (now no longer possible) was partly made up by a \"musical air bridge\" of flights bringing in patrons from West Germany, and the production was embraced by Berliners, running for two years.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article232500/Karin-Huebner-1936-2006.html |title=Karin H\u00fcbner (1936-2006) |author=Peter E.

You'd better sit right down and send for those tickets...' Critics praised the thoughtful use of Shaw's original play, the brilliance of the lyrics, and Loewe's well-integrated score.\"<ref>Everett, William A., Laird, Paul R.

In short, a miraculous musical.\" [[Walter Kerr]], ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]''.\n* \"A felicitous blend of intellect, wit, rhythm and high spirits.

The casting of [[Audrey Hepburn]] instead of Julie Andrews as Eliza was controversial, partly because theatregoers regarded Andrews as perfect for the part and partly because Hepburn's singing voice was dubbed (by [[Marni Nixon]]). [[Jack L. Warner]], the head of [[Warner Bros.]], which produced the film, wanted \"a star with a great deal of name recognition\", but since Julie Andrews did not have any film experience, he thought a movie with her would not be as successful.<ref>Roman, James W.

Lerner in particular disliked the film version of the musical, thinking it did not live up to the standards of Moss Hart's original direction. He was also unhappy with the casting of Hepburn as Eliza Doolittle and that the film was shot in its entirety at the Warner Bros. studio rather than, as he would have preferred, in London.<ref>Lerner, ''The Street Where I Live'' pp 134\u20136.</ref> Despite the controversy, ''My Fair Lady'' was considered a major critical and box office success, and won eight [[Oscars]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture of the Year]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for [[Rex Harrison]], and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for [[George Cukor]].\n\n===Unrealized 2008 film ===\n[[Columbia Pictures]] announced a new adaptation in 2008.<ref>{{cite magazine | last=Gans | first=Andrew | title=Columbia Pictures and CBS Films to Develop New ''My Fair Lady'' Film | magazine=Playbill | date=2008-06-02 | url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/118417.html | accessdate=2008-06-06 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607075158/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/118417.html | archivedate=2008-06-07 }}</ref> The intention was to shoot on location in [[Covent Garden]], [[Drury Lane]], [[Tottenham Court Road]], [[Wimpole Street]] and the [[Ascot Racecourse]].<ref name=Variety>{{cite web| url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117986985.html?categoryid=13&cs=1|title=''Variety'', June 5, 2008|publisher=}}</ref> [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] was signed to direct the film, and [[Colin Firth]] and [[Carey Mulligan]] were possible choices for the leading roles.

The story concerns [[Eliza Doolittle]], a [[Cockney]] flower girl who takes speech lessons from professor Henry Higgins, a [[phonetics|phonetician]], so that she may pass as a lady. The original Broadway and London shows starred [[Rex Harrison]] and [[Julie Andrews]].\n\nThe musical's 1956 [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] production was a notable critical and popular success. It set a record for the [[Long-running musical theatre productions|longest run]] of any show on Broadway up to that time. It was followed by a hit London production, a popular [[My Fair Lady (film)|film version]], and many revivals.  ''My Fair Lady'' has been called \"the perfect musical\".<ref>See, e.g., Steyn, Mark.

The noted [[phonetics|phonetician]] Professor Henry Higgins encounters Eliza at [[Covent Garden]] and laments the vulgarity of her dialect (\"Why Can't the English?\"). Higgins also meets Colonel Pickering, another linguist, and invites him to stay as his houseguest. Eliza and her friends wonder what it would be like to live a comfortable life (\"[[Wouldn't It Be Loverly]]?\").\n\nEliza's father, Alfred P. Doolittle, stops by the next morning searching for money for a drink (\"[[With a Little Bit of Luck]]\"). Soon after, Eliza comes to Higgins's house, seeking [[elocution]] lessons so that she can get a job as an assistant in a florist's shop. Higgins wagers Pickering that, within six months, by teaching Eliza to speak properly, he will enable her to pass for a proper lady.\n\nEliza becomes part of Higgins's household. Though Higgins sees himself as a kindhearted man who merely cannot get along with women (\"I'm an Ordinary Man\"), to others he appears self-absorbed and [[misogynistic]]. Eliza endures Higgins's tyrannical speech tutoring. Frustrated, she dreams of different ways to kill him (\"Just You Wait\"). Higgins's servants lament the stressful atmosphere (\"The Servants' Chorus\"). \n\nJust as Higgins is about to give up on her, Eliza suddenly recites one of her diction exercises in perfect upper-class style (\"[[The Rain in Spain]]\"). Though Mrs Pearce, the housekeeper, insists that Eliza go to bed, she declares she is too excited to sleep (\"[[I Could Have Danced All Night]]\").\n\nFor her first public tryout, Higgins takes Eliza to his mother's box at [[Ascot Racecourse]] (\"Ascot Gavotte\"). Though Eliza shocks everyone when she forgets herself while watching a race and reverts to foul language, she does capture the heart of Freddy Eynsford-Hill. Freddy calls on Eliza that evening, and he declares that he will wait for her in the street outside Higgins' house (\"[[On the Street Where You Live]]\").\n\nEliza's final test requires her to pass as a lady at the Embassy Ball. After more weeks of preparation, she is ready. All the ladies and gentlemen at the ball admire her, and the Queen of [[Transylvania]] invites her to dance with the prince (\"Embassy Waltz\"). A Hungarian phonetician, Zoltan Karpathy, attempts to discover Eliza's origins. Higgins allows Karpathy to dance with Eliza.\n\n===Act II===\nThe ball is a success; Karpathy has declared Eliza to be a Hungarian princess. Pickering and Higgins revel in their triumph (\"You Did It\"), failing to pay attention to Eliza. Eliza is insulted at receiving no credit for her success, packing up and leaving the Higgins house. As she leaves she finds Freddy, who begins to tell her how much he loves her, but she tells him that she has heard enough words; if he really loves her, he should show it (\"Show Me\"). \n\nEliza and Freddy return to Covent Garden but she finds she no longer feels at home there. Her father is there as well, and he tells her that he has received a surprise bequest from an American millionaire, which has raised him to middle-class respectability, and now must marry his lover. Doolittle and his friends have one last spree before the wedding (\"[[Get Me to the Church on Time]]\").\n\nHiggins awakens the next morning. He finds himself out of sorts without Eliza. He wonders why she left after the triumph at the ball and concludes that men (especially himself) are far superior to women (\"A Hymn to Him\"). Pickering notices the Professor's lack of consideration, and also leaves the Higgins house.\n\nHiggins despondently visits his mother's house, where he finds Eliza. Eliza declares she no longer needs Higgins (\"Without You\"). As Higgins walks home, he realizes he's grown attached to Eliza (\"[[I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face]]\"). At home, he sentimentally reviews the recording he made the day Eliza first came to him for lessons, hearing his own harsh words. Eliza suddenly appears in his home. In suppressed joy at their reunion, Professor Higgins scoffs and asks, \"Eliza, where the devil are my slippers?\"\n\n==Characters and original Broadway cast==\nThe original cast of the Broadway stage production:<ref name=guide>[http://guidetomusicaltheatre.com/shows_m/my_fair_lady.htm \"'My Fair Lady' Synopsis, Cast, Scenes and Settings and Musical Numbers\"] guidetomusicaltheatre.com, accessed December 7, 2011.</ref>\n\n* [[Eliza Doolittle]], a young Cockney flowerseller \u2013 [[Julie Andrews]] \n* Henry Higgins, a professor of [[phonetics]] \u2013 [[Rex Harrison]]\n* Alfred P.

However, Shaw, having had a bad experience with ''[[The Chocolate Soldier]]'', a Viennese operetta based on his play ''[[Arms and the Man]]'', refused permission for ''Pygmalion'' to be adapted into a musical. After Shaw died in 1950, Pascal asked lyricist [[Alan Jay Lerner]] to write the musical adaptation. Lerner agreed, and he and his partner [[Frederick Loewe]] began work. But they quickly realised that the play violated several key rules for constructing a musical: the main story was not a love story, there was no subplot or secondary love story, and there was no place for an ensemble.<ref>Lerner, p. 36.</ref> Many people, including [[Oscar Hammerstein II]], who, with [[Richard Rodgers]], had also tried his hand at adapting ''Pygmalion'' into a musical and had given up, told Lerner that converting the play to a musical was impossible, so he and Loewe abandoned the project for two years.<ref>Lerner, p. 38.</ref>\n\nDuring this time, the collaborators separated and Gabriel Pascal died. Lerner had been trying to musicalize ''[[Li'l Abner]]'' when he read Pascal's obituary and found himself thinking about ''Pygmalion'' again.<ref>Lerner, p. 39.</ref> When he and Loewe reunited, everything fell into place. All of the insurmountable obstacles that had stood in their way two years earlier disappeared when the team realised that the play needed few changes apart from (according to Lerner) \"adding the action that took place between the acts of the play\".<ref>Lerner, pp. 43\u201344.</ref> They then excitedly began writing the show. However, [[Chase Manhattan Bank]] was in charge of Pascal's estate, and the musical rights to ''Pygmalion'' were sought both by Lerner and Loewe and by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], whose executives called Lerner to discourage him from challenging the studio. Loewe said, \"We will write the show without the rights, and when the time comes for them to decide who is to get them, we will be so far ahead of everyone else that they will be forced to give them to us.\"<ref>Lerner, p. 47.</ref> For five months Lerner and Loewe wrote, hired technical designers, and made casting decisions. The bank, in the end, granted them the musical rights.\n\nLerner settled on the title ''My Fair Lady'', relating both to one of Shaw's provisional titles for ''Pygmalion'', ''Fair Eliza'', and to the final line of every verse of the nursery rhyme \"[[London Bridge Is Falling Down]]\".  Recalling that the Gershwins' 1925 musical ''Tell Me More'' had been titled ''My Fair Lady'' in its out-of-town tryout, and also had a musical number under that title, Lerner made a courtesy call to Ira Gershwin, alerting him to the use of the title for the Lerner and Loewe musical.{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\n[[No\u00ebl Coward]] was the first to be offered the role of Henry Higgins, but he turned it down, suggesting the producers cast [[Rex Harrison]] instead.<ref>Morley, Sheridan.  ''A Talent to Amuse: A Biography of No\u00ebl Coward'', p. 369, Doubleday & Company, 1969.</ref> After much deliberation, Harrison agreed to accept the part.

You'd better sit right down and send for those tickets...' Critics praised the thoughtful use of Shaw's original play, the brilliance of the lyrics, and Loewe's well-integrated score.\"<ref>Everett, William A., Laird, Paul R.

The casting of [[Audrey Hepburn]] instead of Julie Andrews as Eliza was controversial, partly because theatregoers regarded Andrews as perfect for the part and partly because Hepburn's singing voice was dubbed (by [[Marni Nixon]]). [[Jack L. Warner]], the head of [[Warner Bros.]], which produced the film, wanted \"a star with a great deal of name recognition\", but since Julie Andrews did not have any film experience, he thought a movie with her would not be as successful.<ref>Roman, James W.

Lerner in particular disliked the film version of the musical, thinking it did not live up to the standards of Moss Hart's original direction.

It is used throughout the [[United Kingdom]] to pass the details of stranded motorists between all the major UK motoring organisations and their 400 plus [[vehicle recovery]] agents. In many cases it is also used by the vehicle recovery agent to pass the details to the attending recovery vehicle.\n\n==History==\n[[File:TDold.jpg|thumb|right|The very first standards meeting in 1994 (Boys with their Toys)]]\nOn 30 June 1994, a group of representatives from the UK seven major motoring organisations and the Institute of Vehicle Recovery were invited a meeting at [[Brooklands Museum]]. Brooklands Museum was chosen as the venue because the meeting's chairman Andy Lambert was involved with the museum, having transported the vast majority of the exhibits there, and could therefore show people items they would not normally get to see. He clearly hoped that this would be enough incentive to get \u2018the clubs\u2019 to sit-down in the same room together. It soon emerged that it was a shared dream of all those present that \u2018common standards\u2019 for all aspects of [[vehicle recovery]] could be introduced to the industry. Amongst other things, this group laid the foundations of Turbo Dispatch project.\n\nBecause of the reliability of delivery needed it was decided that [[Mobitex]] should be used. In the UK there was only one provider of Mobitex, namely RAM Data, which later became a subsidiary of [[British Telecom|BT]] called Transcomm. This is why many users still refer to RAMing jobs. Ian Lane of Motor Trade Software (MTS) designed and wrote the protocols along with the [[Gateway (telecommunications)|gateway]] software.  Much pioneering work was carried out during early 1995. In the autumn of 1995 [[Green Flag]] and Delta Rescue were the first motoring organisations to start experimenting with transmissions to the [[Automobile repair shop|garages]], with the first genuine job being sent to Southbank Garage at the end of the year.\n\nThe point where most recovery operators learned about Turbo Dispatch was during the Association of Vehicle Recovery Operators' AVRO EX 1996. Despite it being [[Green Flag]]'s 25th Anniversary, the motoring organisation set up a mini \u2018Control Room\u2019 at the show and let people see for the first time how the system worked. By the end of that year [[the Automobile Association]] had set up a trial in London, sending jobs to selected recovery operators.\n\nTowards the end of 1997, the AA's Evan Anderson became greatly involved in promoting the concept of Turbo Dispatch within the AA. This was undoubtedly the turning point, because Evan seemed to accept that although MTS and RAM did have a monopoly, it was not an intentional one. Anyone else could develop a system, but quite simply nobody else had successfully done so.\n\nIn the following year, the [[RAC plc|RAC]] went live and by the end of the year all the major players in the industry had adopted Turbo Dispatch. By the year 2005 it is estimated that around 92% of the 4 million \u2018garaged\u2019 breakdowns a year were sent to recovery operators using Turbo Dispatch.\n\nThe system is clearly popular with motoring organisations, because of the saving in job dispatcher talking on the telephone to recovery operators. What surprised a lot of people was how popular it was with the operators as well, mainly for the same reasons. A busy controller does not want to take job details over the telephone, when he can have it appear on his computer screen. Because he could then use the same system to dispatch the job to his driver, it meant the whole process could be handled in seconds.\n\n==Technical review==\nThe following notes describe the method of automatically transferring job details from a motoring organisation (or club's) computer into their recovery operator's computer using the Mobitex data network. Since each of the motoring organisations is likely to have its own unique computer system and working practices, it is not practical to attempt to define how automatic job transfer would be best achieved for them. Consequently, only a typical recovery operator's computer installation is defined below.\n\nTypically, the recovery operator job logging and invoicing system is based around a [[personal computer]]. This will be connected to the Mobitex data network by a Masc.{{clarify|date=January 2012}} [[radio modem]] (sometimes called a Mobidem) using one of the PC's [[RS-232]] communication ports. Job transmission will entail the motoring organisation's computer using the recovery operator's unique Mobidem number to call his computer.\n\nOnce a connection has been made the job details are transmitted in the data format defined in the Turbo Dispatch Format Manual, and the call terminated. A dedicated communications computer will usually be employed to constantly monitor the radio modem via the RS232 port. This will operate a program TD.EXE, running under [[Windows]]. Data received from the radio modem will be transferred to an incoming message queue on the other computer, for subsequent automatic processing by the main job taking software (a maximum of 5 seconds delay). An audible sound will also be generated by the communications computer.\n\nImmediately the job details are received by the recovery operator's communications computer, it will transmit an  automatic acknowledgement to the origin of the job message and place the job details in a queue awaiting manual acceptance by the recovery operator's controller. Job Dispatch will be completed by the recovery operator's controller, either by accepting, or rejecting the job and the corresponding transaction being dispatched to the motoring organisation.\n\nThe Turbo Dispatch application was initially restricted to employing the MASC protocol of the Transcomm Mobile Data Network. This [[communications protocol|protocol]] was  adopted because it eliminates the complexity of retries which would result from employing a session based protocol on the radio modems e.g. [[Hayes Microcomputer Products|Hayes]] or [[X.28]].\n\n==Control==\n[[File:TDtoday.jpg|thumb|right|Delegates at a standards meeting 2006 at BT Transcomm's Heathrow headquarters]]\nThe Turbo Dispatch Standards Group used to meet on average two or three times a year.\nIts brief was to \"Maintain a common standard for message and data formats to be used in electronic data communications between host computers and/or data terminals in fixed/mobile environments\".\n\nAll major motoring organisations send representatives and all changes/additions to the standard are discussed and must be agreed by all those present at the meeting. As there is little commercial advantage to any organisation (an improvement for one will normally also benefit the others), there is usually a large amount of agreement.\n\nIn 2010 BT Transcomm announced the closure of the Mobitex Network in the UK.\n\nFollowing a competitive tender process including Presentations with solutions from MTT, BT, Vodafone and Apex Networks, it was unanimously awarded to Apex Networks Ltd and the migration from MTT Turbo Dispatch to an Internet-based solution named Automotive Network Services (ANS) took place in 2012. Apex Networks already had a growing number of users for their new Recovery Management System (RMS) which had initially been developed for Ontime Rescue & Recovery.\n\nFrom 2012 the ANS Standards group now meet quarterly and the forum is attended by the vehicle recovery software providers, namely Apex Networks, MTT and Laserbyte, along with the major motoring organisations and two industry advisers (independent recovery operators that are end-users of the systems). These Meetings normally last for around 3 hours and are held at the Rhodes Arts Complex in Bishop's Stortford, or at various venues around the country provided by the Motoring Organisations (Clubs). The forum was chaired for many years by David Brinklow (Commercial Director of Apex Networks), but more recent has chaired by J.P. Dekker (of Apex Networks)\n\nA copy of the standard document is available to download from https://www.apex-networks.com/Support.aspx\n\n==See also==\n* [[Vehicle recovery]]\n\n==References==\n* ''Professional Recovery'', December 2001, Partnership Publications\n* ''Vehicle Recovery Link'', June 1997, May 1999 and July 1999, R K Solutions.\n* ''The World History of the Towing and Recovery Industry'', John Hawkins, TT Publications Inc. 280 pp. {{ISBN|978-0-9625135-0-3}}\n* {{Google books|id=sRvKWbezbFYC|title=The Motoring Century: the story of the Royal Automobile Club}}, Piers Brendon, Bloomsbury Publishing Plc, 1997. 432 pp. {{ISBN|978-0-7475-3034-3}}\n* ''Breakdown Doctor: The Real Life Adventures of a 1960s Road Rescue Man'', Fred Henderson, Reading Room Publishing, 2005. 192 pp. {{ISBN|978-0-9548056-2-3}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.turboexchange.net Official Website]\n\n[[Category:Telecommunications-related introductions in 1994]]\n[[Category:Packet radio]]\n[[Category:Road transport in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Standards of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Emergency road services]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2017}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{notability|date=July 2010}}\n{{primary sources|date=July 2010}}\n{{No footnotes|date=January 2012}}\n{{cleanup list|date=January 2012}}\n}}\n\n'''Turbo Dispatch''' is a [[public domain]] standard for the electronic transfer of job details, initially using [[packet radio]], but now also using the [[internet]].
