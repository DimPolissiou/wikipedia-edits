Everything has worked in the most satisfactory manner, the train rounding the exceedingly sharp curves easily, and mounting the steep grades without trouble. The posts for an iron way were made up of two channel bars united by two plates, thereby forming a box-like structure whose cross section may be varied as demanded by location. The posts were placed upon foundations, the plans of which varied to suit the character of the material that may be encountered.<ref name=\"SciAm\"/>\n\nThe way upon which the train ran consisted of a single iron girder 4 feet in depth for each span, placed over the center line of the posts. The girder carried an upper track beam and a lower track beam, upon the sides of each of which the rails, four in number, were placed. The two bearing rails, which carried the load of the train, consisted of angle irons placed upon the outer upper edge of wooden stringers upon the lower track beam. These stringers were placed in the exterior recesses formed by two channel bars properly secured to the sides of the posts. These rails were fastened to each other, to the stringers, and to the track beam by bolts passing clear through. Two vertically placed rails for the balancing or friction wheels were carried by the upper track beam. The distance from out to out between the lower rails was 22\u00bd inches, this being sufficient to insure the necessary transverse stiffness. This was the gauge of the road. The distance between the upper rails was 17\u00bd inches. It was expected to adopt the common form of rail, beveling the edges of the lower stringers and placing the rail at an angle of about 45 degrees. The rails were in the form of a right angle, and the treads of the wheels were made with a corresponding right angle groove. The usual length of post, 24 feet, would give a clear headway of 14 feet, 4 feet being taken up by the truss and 6 feet forming the foundation.<ref name=\"SciAm\"/>\n\nThe switch was formed of a single swinging section turning upon a hinge of great strength attached to one of the posts. A movement of four or five feet by the free end of the switch was enough to permit the cars and trucks on one track to clear the end of the other track. The free end travels upon a carriage provided with rollers moving upon a supporting rail. Suitable mechanism was provided for operating the switch and locking it in place.\n\nThe truck was a development of the conditions controlling the adoption of the permanent way. It consisted of a horizontal rectangular wrought iron frame, stiffened by cast iron pieces and provided with stiff pedestals bolted to its under side, in which was a fixed short axle for the wheels. Each truck had four wheels set at an angle of about 45 degrees, the axles being properly inclined. Between the supporting wheels were two horizontal wheels, one on each side of the upper girder, upon vertical axles attached to the frame. These wheels bear<!--> or bore? <--> upon the rails of the upper truck beam, and were kept in yielding contact with the rails by springs outside the boxes, and served as balancing wheels to take the side oscillations of the cars. They were formed with flanges that passed under the lower edges of the rails, thus tying the truck to the rails, so that no lifting or jumping could take place, and there was no possibility of the trucks running off the track. The wheels were 42 inches in diameter, had a tread of 3\u00bd inches, and rotated independently of each other. In case any or all of the wheels should break, provision was made to prevent the cars from overturning or leaving the track, by means of a strong shoe, which would slide upon but could not leave the way. On top of the truck frame was a movable iron frame carrying four posts containing heavy spiral springs. These posts interlock with similar spring sockets bolted to the framing of the floor of the car, which was directly above the truck and within 18 inches of the top of the girder. The truck was guided in turning by a center pin, and was securely tied to the car body, as the horizontal flanges of its frame castings overlap the rim of the upper turntable. In passing curves and switches, the trucks turned upon the balancing wheels, placed centrally between the supporting wheels, which were 4 feet apart.<ref name=\"SciAm\"/>\n\nIt has been found that, by reason of the independent motion of all the truck wheels, curves were followed so closely that practically the increase of friction of the cars upon curves even as small as 50 feet radius was too slight to be noticed or measured by weighing in a model one-eighth full size. This construction of the trucks also admitted of a car 50 feet long turning from a street only 28 feet wide into another of the same width.\n\n[[File:Meigs train internal viwe.jpg|thumb|Internal view]]\nThe cars possessed many novel features, both outside and inside. The circular section and rounded ends admitted of the strongest possible construction without an overweight of material. The floor consists of a platform made of 5 inch channel beams, and was 7\u00bd feet wide by 51 feet 2 inches long. The framing of the body was of light T iron ribs, bent in a circle, filled in by panels covered with rich upholstering, which covers all the interior; the exterior was sheathed with paper and copper. The cylindrical portion was 10 feet 8\u00bd inches in diameter. While adding to the strength, this form was expected to diminish the wind resistance fully one-third. The interior of the car was light, roomy, and pleasing to the eye. The seats were upholstered like the rest of the car, and comfort and luxury have been carefully studied in every detail. At each window was a specially designed device for securing ventilation without the annoyance caused by dust. There was an entire absence of sharp corners, so that, in case of a serious accident, the liability of the passenger being greatly injured was largely avoided.<ref name=\"SciAm\"/>\n\nThe locomotive consisted of a platform car supported upon a truck at either end and housed like the passenger car. The floor was 7\u00bd feet wide by 29\u00bc feet in extreme length; the tender was 24\u2154 feet long, had a tank for the water and a bin for the coal, besides additional room for other purposes. Upon the floor of the engine were, in effect, two complete stationary engines, each connected with a single driving wheel. The boiler was of the locomotive type, was 60 inch in diameter, 15 feet in length, and was placed over the engines, its center line being 61 inch above the floor. There were 200 tubes, 2 inch in diameter and 7 feet long; the grate is 4\u00bd feet square. The crown sheet was arched in shape, and was inclined downward at the back end to allow of climbing and descending grades equal to 800 feet to the mile without exposing any uncovered part to the fire. The cylinders were 12 by 22 inch, and their center lines were placed 18 inch above the floor and 61 inch apart. The piston rods connected with independent crossheads gliding upon steel girders supported at their ends by standards bolted to the floor beams.<ref name=\"SciAm\"/>\n\nThe driving wheels were 44.6 inch in diameter, flanged upon their lower edge like the balance wheels of the trucks, and were mounted upon steel axles 6 inch in diameter, which extend through a sliding box containing the journals. The boxes slid in cast iron ways placed at right angle to the line of the engine, and each axle had a crank keyed upon its upper end. The well known slotted yoke connection was used. The slide valves were of the usual locomotive form. The links were placed in a horizontal instead of a vertical position, and were operated by two bell cranks. The throttle valve, link rod, brake, and coupling rods, and the connection between the driving boxes for producing pressure against the rails, were operated by hydraulic power, although hand levers were also provided.<ref name=\"SciAm\"/>\n\nAdhesion of the driving wheels to the rails was obtained by means of a cylinder and piston secured to the sliding boxes. The engineer was on an elevated platform in the front part of the engine, the fireman being at the rear end. The former had an unobstructed view through the windows of the monitor roof, and before him were five hydraulic cocks, which control the throttle, links, sliding boxes of the driving wheels, the brake, and the coupling rods of the entire train, while just above were steam and hydraulic pressure gauges and indicators, whistle and bell ropes, etc. With an engine thus furnished with provisions for gripping the rails, steep grades became of minor importance, as the steepest possible could be ascended if the requisite power was provided.<ref name=\"SciAm\"/>\n\nOne turn of the cock controlling the couplings divided the train into segments of separate cars, each of which had a brake which acted automatically upon detachment from the train. This partially destroyed the momentum of the whole, and a collision could only take place by a succession of comparatively light blows from the engine and slowing sections of the train, instead of by a single blow with the momentum of the whole train. The brakes were operated upon the balancing wheels of the trucks, but they mayed also be fitted upon the supporting wheels. The action of the brakes could be well illustrated by rails between the rolls of a rolling mill, except that the action was reversed. It was apparent that no slipping of the wheels can take place, no matter what pressure may be brought to bear upon them.<ref name=\"SciAm\"/>\n\nThis system was as applicable for surface as for elevated railroads. It was more cheaply to build than the ordinary road, as the construction of the rolling stock allowed the contour of the ground to be more closely followed. As an elevated road in cities, the permanent structure presented far less obstruction to light and air than the usual form. The center of gravity of the cars and engine was brought as low as possible, thereby lessening the effect of leverage caused by wind pressure. The smooth, even surface of the exterior of the entire train served to decrease the resistance to the wind, and permitted a high rate of speed.<ref name=\"SciAm\"/>\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Meigs Elevated Railway building.jpg|The railway site in 2010.

The smooth, even surface of the exterior of the entire train served to decrease the resistance to the wind, and permitted a high rate of speed.<ref name=\"SciAm\"/>\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Meigs Elevated Railway building.jpg|The railway site in 2010.\nFile:Meigs Elevated Railway plaque.jpg|Plaque marking the site.\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat|Meigs Elevated Railway}}\n*[http://www.catskillarchive.com/rrextra/odmeig.Html Oddities - MEIGS ELEVATED RAILWAY]\n*[https://www.google.com/patents/US313830 US patent for Meigs Elevated Railway]\n*[https://www.google.com/patents/US163228 US patent for earlier Meigs Railway design]\n{{Coord|42.3728643|-71.0802057|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Transportation in Boston]]\n[[Category:Public transportation in the Boston area]]\n[[Category:Defunct monorails]]\n", "name_user": "Stevevance", "label": "safe", "comment": "updated the two photo captions to explain that the plaque was on the side of a former building that has been demolished", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meigs_Elevated_Railway"}

The forces were formed upon the secession of Katanga from the [[Republic of the Congo]] with help from [[Belgian army|Belgian soldiers]] and former officers of the ''[[Force Publique]]''. Belgian troops also provided much of the early training for the Gendarmerie, which was mainly composed of Katangese but largely led by Belgians and later European mercenaries. \n\nThroughout the existence of the State of Katanga, the gendarmes sporadically fought various tribes and the [[Arm\u00e9e Nationale Congolaise]] (ANC). In February 1961 the Gendarmerie initiated a series of operations aimed at suppressing anti-secessionist rebels of the [[Association G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Baluba du Katanga]] (BALUBAKAT) in North Katanga. The campaign was largely successful, but the fighting led to atrocities and gendarmes were halted by forces of the [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]] (ONUC) during the [[Battle of Kabalo]] in April 1961. ONUC then initiated efforts to remove foreign mercenaries from the Gendarmerie, and launched [[Operation Rum Punch]] to arrest them in August 1961. They came into conflict with ONUC three times after, in [[Operation Morthor]] (September 1961), [[Operation UNOKAT]] (December 1961), and [[Operation Grandslam]] (December 1962). Operation Grandslam marked the end of the Katangese secession in January 1963. \n\nAfter the secession, many gendarmes returned to a civilian live or were integrated with the ANC. However, around 8,000 refused to, and many kept their arms and roamed  [[North Rhodesia]], Angola and Katanga. Many crossed the Congo border into Angola, where Portuguese colonial authorities assisted and trained them. They were involved in several mutinies and attempted invasions of the Congo, most notably the [[Stanleyville mutinies]] in 1966 and 1967. \n\nAfter 1967, around 2,500 gendarmes were present in Angola, where they were reorganized as the [[Congolese National Liberation Front]] (FLNC) and fought in the [[Angolan War of Independence]] on the side of the Portuguese government against the [[Movimento Popular de Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de Angola]] (MPLA) and [[Uni\u00e3o Nacional para a Independ\u00eancia Total de Angola]] (UNITA). When the war ended in 1975, they fought in the [[Angolan Civil War]] against the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]] (FNLA).  The FLNC was involved in [[Shaba I]] and [[Shaba II|II]], attempted invasions of Katanga. Split into factions after the war, the [[Katangese Tigers|Tigres]] emerged and played a decisive role in the [[First Congo War]]. There has since been little gendarme presence, but they have emerged as a symbol of secessionist thinking\n\n== Origins ==\n\n=== Background ===\n{{Main|Congo Crisis}}\n[[File:Kongo_1961_map_en.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kongo_1961_map_en.png|left|thumb|Map of the Congo with the State of Katanga in green]]\nThe [[Belgian Congo]] was established from the [[Congo Free State]] in 1908.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wdl.org/en/item/11900/|title=Belgian Congo|last=|first=|date=1920|website=World Digital Library|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> [[Belgium]] held control of the colony until it gained independence as the [[Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville)|Republic of the Congo]] on June 30, 1960.

Approximately 5,000 troops were earmarked for the operation, which focused on a northward offensive from Lubudi. At the same time, they were to recapture the town of [[Manono, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Manono]], secure the area south of it, and launch attacks on [[Kabalo]] from [[Kalemie|Albertville]] to the east and [[Kongolo, Tanganyika|Kongolo]] to the north.{{sfn|Lefever|Joshua|1966|p=P-16}} The Katangese Gendarmerie subsequently launched operations Banquise, Mambo, and Lotus against the BALUBAKAT rebels.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|pp=47\u201349}} In March the army seized Manono.{{sfn|Lefever|Joshua|1966|p=P-16}}\n\nThe Gendarmerie then shifted their focus to Kabalo, where they chiefly intended to secure the railway.{{sfn|Higgins|1980|p=417}} The town was garrisoned by two companies of an Ethiopian battalion serving with ONUC.{{sfn|Lefever|Joshua|1966|p=P-16}}{{sfn|Puren|Pottinger|1986|p=30}} On 7 April a Katangese plane carrying 30 mercenaries landed to secure the airstrip in the town but they were promptly arrested by the ONUC troops.{{sfn|Puren|Pottinger|1986|p=30}} Katangese forces moving by land attacked ONUC soldiers and fought with BALUBAKAT partisans.

Such efforts largely failed.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=50}}\n\nAfter being pressured by the United States and United Nations, Belgium removed many of its forces from the region from August to September 1961. However, many officers remained, without official Belgian support, or became mercenaries. To support these efforts, Belgium organized hundreds of Europeans to fight with Katanga. At the same time the United Nations attempted to suppress foreign support to the Gendarmerie; 338 mercenaries and 443 political advisers were expelled from the region by August. That same month, war veterans were first [[Military awards and decorations|honored]]. Dead soldiers were also remembered in ceremonies at the [[Sts.

Mercenary [[Jean Schramme]] was appointed to be commander of an army in exile, while mercenary Jeremiah Puren was ordered to evacuate what remained of the Katangese Air Force, along with necessary military equipment and the Katangese treasury. This was accomplished via air and railway. Rhodesian operatives assisted in smuggling the gold reserves out of the country.

Those who integrated suffered threats and violence, and were given lower ranks. An estimated 7,000 returned to civilian life, and a further 8,000 escaped disarmament. Of the 8,000, some found work in security, and thousands of others were reported to be roaming \"in the bush in South Katanga\". Many could not return to their homes, and were considered outcasts. Further United Nations efforts at reconciliation were ended as the United Nations focused on withdrawing its own forces from the region in December 1963. The ANC began raiding pro-secession communities, as gendarmes continued to roam North Rhodesia, Angola and Katanga.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|pp=64\u201365}}\n\nThroughout 1963 gendarmes steadily crossed into Angola. Portuguese colonial authorities, eager to assist the anticommunist Katangese, organised them in \"refugee\" camps. By 1964, two of the four camps had become dedicated training facilities. Mercenaries traveled from Katanga to Angola via Rhodesia to relay messages between Tshombe, the gendarmes, and the mercenaries, with logistical support from [[Southern Rhodesia]].{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=67}} Around April, Tshombe appeared to have remobilised his forces.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=68}} Immediately after becoming Prime Minister in July, he ordered the exiled Katangese to return to the Congo and mobilised some of those that had been in hiding so that they could suppress the [[Kwilu rebellion|Kwilu]] and [[Simba rebellion|Simba rebels]].{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=69}} By 1965 the rebellions had been largely quelled largely due to the success of the former gendarmes and mercenaries.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=75}} The use of mercenaries bothered President Kasa-Vubu, which created divisions with the commander of the ANC, [[Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu]], who appreciated their effectiveness. Kasa-Vubu also developed a rivalry with Tshombe, and in October 1965 dismissed him from the premiership. Political deadlock ensued as Parliament refused to approve Kasa-Vubu's new appointee to the premiership, and in November Mobutu launched a coup and assumed the presidency.<ref>{{cite news| title = Congo : Ringing the Changes| newspaper = Arab Observer| date = 6 December 1965| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yl08AQAAIAAJ}}</ref> The mercenaries retained significant political distance from Mobutu's new regime.

The mutinies were led by European mercenaries. An estimated 600 former gendarmes led by Schramme were present in Kisangani during the mutiny. Under pressure from the ANC, Schramme was forced to evacuate the city with 300 mercenaries and a few thousand gendarmes.

The forces were formed upon the secession of Katanga from the [[Republic of the Congo]] with help from [[Belgian army|Belgian soldiers]] and former officers of the ''[[Force Publique]]''. Belgian troops also provided much of the early training for the Gendarmerie, which was mainly composed of Katangese but largely led by Belgians and later European mercenaries. \n\nThroughout the existence of the State of Katanga, the gendarmes sporadically fought various tribes and the [[Arm\u00e9e Nationale Congolaise]] (ANC). In February 1961 the Gendarmerie initiated a series of operations aimed at suppressing anti-secessionist rebels of the [[Association G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Baluba du Katanga]] (BALUBAKAT) in North Katanga. The campaign was largely successful, but the fighting led to atrocities and gendarmes were halted by forces of the [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]] (ONUC) during the [[Battle of Kabalo]] in April 1961. ONUC then initiated efforts to remove foreign mercenaries from the Gendarmerie, and launched [[Operation Rum Punch]] to arrest them in August 1961. They came into conflict with ONUC three times after, in [[Operation Morthor]] (September 1961), [[Operation UNOKAT]] (December 1961), and [[Operation Grandslam]] (December 1962). Operation Grandslam marked the end of the Katangese secession in January 1963. \n\nAfter the secession, many gendarmes returned to a civilian live or were integrated with the ANC. However, around 8,000 refused to, and many kept their arms and roamed  [[North Rhodesia]], Angola and Katanga. Many crossed the Congo border into Angola, where Portuguese colonial authorities assisted and trained them. They were involved in several mutinies and attempted invasions of the Congo, most notably the [[Stanleyville mutinies]] in 1966 and 1967. \n\nAfter 1967, around 2,500 gendarmes were present in Angola, where they were reorganized as the [[Congolese National Liberation Front]] (FLNC) and fought in the [[Angolan War of Independence]] on the side of the Portuguese government against the [[Movimento Popular de Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de Angola]] (MPLA) and [[Uni\u00e3o Nacional para a Independ\u00eancia Total de Angola]] (UNITA). When the war ended in 1975, they fought in the [[Angolan Civil War]] against the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]] (FNLA).  The FLNC was involved in [[Shaba I]] and [[Shaba II|II]], attempted invasions of Katanga. Split into factions after the war, the [[Katangese Tigers|Tigres]] emerged and played a decisive role in the [[First Congo War]]. There has since been little gendarme presence, but they have emerged as a symbol of secessionist thinking\n\n== Origins ==\n\n=== Background ===\n{{Main|Congo Crisis}}\n[[File:Kongo_1961_map_en.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kongo_1961_map_en.png|left|thumb|Map of the Congo with the State of Katanga in green]]\nThe [[Belgian Congo]] was established from the [[Congo Free State]] in 1908.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wdl.org/en/item/11900/|title=Belgian Congo|last=|first=|date=1920|website=World Digital Library|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> [[Belgium]] held control of the colony until it gained independence as the [[Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville)|Republic of the Congo]] on June 30, 1960.

Following the operation the UN was able to confirm that Portuguese Angola, South Africa, and Northern Rhodesia had assisted the Katangese in arming their air force.{{sfn|Dorn|2016|p=32}}\n\n=== Exile, return, and the Simba rebellion ===\n{{Further|Simba rebellion}}\nAfter the defeat of the State of Katanga, plans to disarm or integrate the gendarmes were made. On 8 February 1963, General Muk\u00e9 and several of his officers pledged their allegiance to President Kasa-Vubu.{{sfn|O'Ballance|1999|p=63}} However, of the estimated 14,000\u201317,000 gendarmes, only 3,500 registered for integration, and only around 2,000\u20133,000 became part of the ANC. Those who integrated suffered threats and violence, and were given lower ranks. An estimated 7,000 returned to civilian life, and a further 8,000 escaped disarmament. Of the 8,000, some found work in security, and thousands of others were reported to be roaming \"in the bush in South Katanga\". Many could not return to their homes, and were considered outcasts. Further United Nations efforts at reconciliation were ended as the United Nations focused on withdrawing its own forces from the region in December 1963. The ANC began raiding pro-secession communities, as gendarmes continued to roam North Rhodesia, Angola and Katanga.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|pp=64\u201365}}\n\nThroughout 1963 gendarmes steadily crossed into Angola. Portuguese colonial authorities, eager to assist the anticommunist Katangese, organised them in \"refugee\" camps. By 1964, two of the four camps had become dedicated training facilities. Mercenaries traveled from Katanga to Angola via Rhodesia to relay messages between Tshombe, the gendarmes, and the mercenaries, with logistical support from [[Southern Rhodesia]].{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=67}} Around April, Tshombe appeared to have remobilised his forces.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=68}} Immediately after becoming Prime Minister in July, he ordered the exiled Katangese to return to the Congo and mobilised some of those that had been in hiding so that they could suppress the [[Kwilu rebellion|Kwilu]] and [[Simba rebellion|Simba rebels]].{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=69}} By 1965 the rebellions had been largely quelled largely due to the success of the former gendarmes and mercenaries.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=75}} The use of mercenaries bothered President Kasa-Vubu, which created divisions with the commander of the ANC, [[Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu]], who appreciated their effectiveness. Kasa-Vubu also developed a rivalry with Tshombe, and in October 1965 dismissed him from the premiership. Political deadlock ensued as Parliament refused to approve Kasa-Vubu's new appointee to the premiership, and in November Mobutu launched a coup and assumed the presidency.<ref>{{cite news| title = Congo : Ringing the Changes| newspaper = Arab Observer| date = 6 December 1965| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yl08AQAAIAAJ}}</ref> The mercenaries retained significant political distance from Mobutu's new regime. Relations between the two parties quickly worsened, culminating in [[Stanleyville mutinies|a bloody mutiny]] in July 1966.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=75}}\n\nA March 1967 trial of Tshombe ''[[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' criminalized the actions of the gendarmes retrospectively. After the trial, all the gendarmes were referred to as 'mercenaries' by Congolese press. A [[Stanleyville mutinies#Second mutiny|second wave of mutinies]] broke out on July 5, 1967 in [[Bukavu]] and Kisangani (formerly Stanleyville), after Tshombe's plane was hijacked and he was detained in [[Algiers]]. The mutinies were led by European mercenaries. An estimated 600 former gendarmes led by Schramme were present in Kisangani during the mutiny. Under pressure from the ANC, Schramme was forced to evacuate the city with 300 mercenaries and a few thousand gendarmes. They reached Bukavu, and a secessionist state was declared.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|pp=77\u201378}}<ref>{{Cite news|last=Tanner|first=Henry|url=|title=Congo: The Revolt That Failed|date=July 23, 1967|work=The New York Times|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> A plan was proposed by the [[International Red Cross]] to evacuate 950 gendarmes and around 650 of their dependents to [[Zambia]]. Schramme and Mobutu objected, and the plan did not go forward. Though the ANC continued fighting, around 900 gendarmes gave up their arms and crossed into Rwanda. At the end of the mutinies, the gendarmes agreed to a cease-fire proposed by [[Organisation of African Unity]] Secretary General [[Diallo Telli]] under which they could gain amnesty by returning to the Congo. The mercenaries were expelled from Africa and returned to Europe.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|pp=77\u201378}}{{Sfn|Arnold|1999|p=15}}\n\nA brief rebellion was executed by mercenary [[Bob Denard]] from November 1 to 5, 1967. Called \"Operation Luciver\", ex-gendarmes  crossed from Angola to Katanga and occupied Kisenge and Mutshatsha before being defeated by the ANC.

The integration of the [[pole dance|burlesque pole]] as a nearly ubiquitous prop has shifted the emphasis in the performance toward a more acrobatic, [[pornography|explicit]] expression compared to the slow-developing burlesque style. Most strippers work in strip clubs. A \"house dancer\" works for a particular club or [[franchising|franchise]], while a \"feature dancer\" tends to have her own [[celebrity]], touring a club circuit making appearances. Entertainers (dancers) are often not actual employees of the club itself but perform as [[independent contractor]]s.\n\nUntil the 1970s, strippers in Western cultures were almost invariably female, performing to male audiences. Since then, male strippers have also become common, but strippers are still overwhelmingly female. Certain male and female strippers also perform for [[LGBT]] audiences as well as for both sexes in [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] contexts. Before the 1970s, dancers of both sexes appeared largely in underground clubs or as part of a [[theatre]] experience, but the practice eventually became common enough on its own. Performances are usually fully choreographed, involve dance routines and a costume of some sort.<ref name=\"What Does A Male Stripper Do?\">{{cite web | last = Carrier | first = Brandon | title = What does a male stripper do?

The [[physical attractiveness]] and [[sex appeal]] of the dancer determines the business the stripper tends to generate. There are no job prerequisites; formal training is minimal, primarily on the job and provided by more senior dancers. Dancers learn a set of rules, such as: never leave money unattended; never leave the club with a customer; and never refuse a table dance. As long as she can \"sell\" herself, she is capable of becoming an exotic dancer.<ref name=\"Bernard 2003\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Bernard | first1 = Constance | last2 = DeGabrielle | first2 = Christen | last3 = Cartier | first3 = Lynette | last4 = Monk-Turner | first4 = Elizabeth | last5 = Phill | first5 = Celestine | last6 = Sherwood | first6 = Jennifer | last7 = Tyree | first7 = Thomasena | title = Exotic dancers: gender differences in societal reaction, subcultural ties, and conventional support | journal = Journal of Criminal Justice and Popular Culture | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 1\u201311 | date = Winter 2003 | url = http://www.albany.edu/scj/jcjpc/jcjpc_vol10.html#vol10is1 | ref = harv }} [http://www.albany.edu/scj/jcjpc/vol10is1/bernard.pdf PDF].</ref> The image of strippers as known today evolved through the late [[striptease#1960s-1970s|1960s and 1970s]] in the U.S. and international cultures. By the 1980s, the pole dancing and highly-explicit imagery associated with today's performers was widely accepted and frequently portrayed in film, television, and theater. In a bikini performance, both [[breasts]] and [[genital#Genitals|genital]] areas typically remain covered by revealing [[attire]] while dancers provide services and entertainment. [[Go-go dancer]]s will retain their tops and bottoms for the duration of their performance. A stripper whose [[torso|upper body]] is exposed but the [[genital#Genitals|genital]] areas remain obscured during a [[performance]] is said to be topless.\n\nTouching of strippers is not permitted in many localities. However, some dancers and clubs allow touching of dancers during private dances. If permitted, during a lap dance the dancer grinds against the customer's crotch while they remains clothed in an attempt to arouse or bring the recipient to climax.<ref name=\"Bremer 2005\">{{citation | last = Bremer | first = Susan | contribution = The grind | editor-last1 = Egan | editor-first1 = Danielle | editor-last2 = Frank | editor-first2 = Katherine | editor-last3 = Johnson | editor-first3 = Merri | title = Flesh for fantasy: producing and consuming exotic dance | pages = 35\u201352 | publisher = Thunder's Mouth Press.

Due to the common practice of hiring strippers as contractors, not as full-time employees, strippers must deal with extreme job insecurity, unstable pay, no health benefits, and the requirement of paying fees to the club for technically renting their stage. This precarious employment is accepted because of the stigma associated with exotic dancing. Dancers use props such as make-up, clothing, costumes, and appealing fragrances to complete their character and maintain their \"[[persona|front]]\".\n\n===Inside the club===\nStrippers, when working, are most likely to be found at strip clubs. An essential draw of the strip club is the live entertainment, which the vast majority of the time are the strippers. Dancers effectively entertaining customers are the key to generating revenue by keeping the customers on site and enticing them to be repeat visitors. House dancers work for a particular club or [[franchising|franchise]]. Feature dancers tend to have their own [[celebrity]], touring a club circuit and making appearances. [[Pornographic film actor|Porn stars]] will often become feature dancers to earn extra income and build their fan base. High-profile adult film performers [[Jenna Haze]] and Teagan Presley among others have participated in feature shows through the USA, as did now-retired stars such as [[Jenna Jameson]]. Entertainers (dancers) are often not actual employees of the club itself but allowed to perform as independent contractors for a predetermined house fee.\n\nDuring each set of one or more songs, the current performer will dance on stage in exchange for tips. Where legal (or legal restrictions are ignored), dancers may offer additional services such as [[lap dance]]s or a trip to the champagne room for a set fee rather than a tip. Strippers can be contracted for performances outside the strip club environment. Some strippers will only strip for private engagements and do not have a regular affiliation with a strip club. Much like activities inside the club, different dancers have different comfort levels for services they will provide during a private party. Aside from advertising for striptease services outside the club, an unknown percentage of strippers also work in other aspects of the [[sex industry]]. This can include erotic and [[nude photography|nude modeling]], [[pornography]], [[escort agency|escorting]], and in some cases [[prostitution]]. Outside the U.S., the use of strip clubs to facilitate sex for hire is much more common, and stripping is viewed in those settings as [[advertising]] for sexually oriented services performed in private areas of the club or off [[premises]].\n\n====Stage performance====\nMost clubs have a dancer rotation where each dancer in turn will perform for one or more songs in a fixed sequence which repeats during a shift. More informal clubs will have dancers take turns when a stage becomes empty or have a free flow of entertainers where the stage has any number of entertainers who wander off and on at will. Feature entertainers are not usually part of the rotation, and have set times where they will perform that are advertised throughout the shift. If a [[DJ]] is present, they will emcee the rotation and typically announce the current dancer(s) on stage and possibly whom to expect in future sets.\n\n====Tip collection====\nDuring each set of one or more songs, the current performer will dance on stage in exchange for tips. Dancers collect [[tip (gratuity)|tip]]s from customers either while on stage or after the dancer has finished a stage show and is mingling with the audience. A customary tip (where customers can do so at the stage) is a dollar [[paper currency|bill]] folded lengthwise and placed in the dancer's [[garter (stockings)|garter]] from the ''tip rail''. Other common tip methods are to insert the dollar into the stripper's cleavage from the hand or mouth, or to simply place it or toss it onto the stage. Tipping during a stage performance is prohibited by some clubs due to restrictions in local ordinance or past incidents on the premises. Each club and dancer will have individual tolerance levels for customer interaction including tipping. Some clubs will have multiple stages on the premises that dancers will move between, but typically the dancer would collect for her time on the main stage during a rotation. Tips can also be collected during private dances.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wendroff|first=Darren|title=Strip-Club Etiquette|journal= [[Men's Health]] |date=September 2004|volume=19|issue=7|page=86| url = http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/14174771/strip-club-etiquette |accessdate=10 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Private dance====\nWhere legal (or legal restrictions are ignored), dancers may offer additional services such as lap dances or a trip to the champagne room for a set fee rather than a tip. This fee will typically include a set fee for the room, for a set amount of time. Private dances in the main club areas most often take the form of [[table dance]]s, [[lap dance|lap and couch dances]], and bed dances among others. An ''air dance'' is a particular form of private dance where little to no contact between the dancer and customer occurs. This class of dance spans the different categories above, and some dancers can perform air dances when more contact-heavy forms of dance were expected and paid for.\n\nTable dances are distinguished from other forms of dances in that they can be performed where the customer is seated on the main floor. Table dances also refer to a form of minimal touch private dance where the performer is physically located on a small table in front of the customer(s). Table dances should not be confused with table stages, where the stripper is at or above eye level on a platform surrounded by chairs and usually enough table surface for customers to place drinks and tip money. These stages are configured for close viewing of the striptease and are known for dancers lowering themselves from the stage onto customers during their set.\n\nLap dances can be (and are) performed in all manner of seating, ranging from plain stools and kitchen-grade chairs to plush leather armchairs. They can also be performed with the customer standing in these designated areas. A service provided by many clubs is for a customer to be placed on stage with one or more dancers for a public lap dance. Occasions for this type of performance are [[bachelor parties]] and birthdays in the club among others. Bed dances are designed for the customer to be lying down with the entertainer(s) positioned on top of them. Bed dances are the least common of the three, and in many clubs, these are a more expensive option than a lap dance because of the novelty and increased level of contact between customer and service provider.\n\nA ''champagne room'' (also called a ''champagne lounge'' or ''champagne court'') is a specialized VIP Room service offered by gentleman's clubs where a customer can purchase time (usually in half-hour increments) with an exotic dancer in a private room on the premises. Depending on the quality of the club, the room, which is away from the hustle and bustle of the main club, is well decorated and usually has its own bar. Clubs sell [[champagne (wine)|champagne]] by the glass or by the bottle for both the dancer and the customer. Strippers who have multiple trips to VIP in a given [[shift work|shift]] will often give their portion of the alcohol to other dancers or customers to reduce the amount they are drinking themselves.\n\n===Outside the club===\nStrippers can be contracted for performances outside the strip club environment. Some strippers will only strip for private engagements and do not have a regular affiliation with a strip club.\n\n====Bachelor and bachelorette parties====\n{{Main|Bachelor party|Bachelorette party}}\nA [[bachelor party]] may involve activities beyond the usual party and social-gathering ingredients (often drinking [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] and [[gambling]]), such as going to a strip club or hiring a stripper to perform in a private setting like a [[home]] or [[hotel]]. In some traditions, more [[hazing]]-like tests and pranks at the future groom's expense, which shows the whole thing is also a [[rite of passage]] from bachelorhood (associated with an [[adolescent]] lifestyle, often in the common past of most participants, e.g., in their student years) to \"more responsible\" marital life. These pranks can involve a stripper if the entertainer is willing. Bachelor parties have come to symbolize the last time when the groom is free of the influence of his new wife. Some women also participate in a similar party to be held for the bride-to-be. This is known as a [[bachelorette party]] or Hen party. Some also chose instead to hold a so-called [[stag and doe|Stag and Doe]] party in the US or a ''hag party'' or ''hag do'' in the UK (\"hag\" being a [[portmanteau]] \"hen\" and \"stag\"), in which both the bride and groom attend. The female equivalent of a stag party in Canada is often known as a \"stagette\", \"doe\", or \"bachelorette\".\n\n====Private parties====\nPrivate parties are popular events for which to hire strippers. There are many [[entertainment]] businesses that have strippers contracted for private performances. Some of these companies have a national presence, with strippers contracted in multiple states and some who work regionally over a multi-state area. Strippers will also do side work and handle their own [[gentlemen's agreement|agreement]]s and [[payment]] arrangements. Written agreements are atypical in this type of transaction unless a formal, registered business is involved. They could also travel over significant (i.e. flight required) distances for private events and appointments, most of the time passing the cost of travel and [[lodging|accommodation]]s onto the customer. Patrons at the clubs in which the strippers work are a primary source of [[customer]]s for their work outside the club. Much like activities inside the club, different dancers have different comfort levels for services they will provide during a private party.\n\n====Other activities====\nAside from advertising for striptease services outside the club, an unknown percentage of strippers also work in other aspects of the [[sex industry]]. This can include erotic and nude modeling, pornography, escorting, and in some cases prostitution (which is now illegal in all states other than Nevada within the U.S.). These activities are not [[mutually exclusive]], meaning that a stripper who models on the side would be a stripper ''and'' a model.\n\nAdult industry trade shows often have strippers working, though many of them are affiliated with individual companies and not necessarily [[freelancers]]. More [[traditional]] [[industries]] have made use of go-go dancers to provide [[entertainment]] and act as [[bargirl]]s or hostesses. The lack of explicit [[nudity]] makes go-go dancers more socially acceptable than topless and nude performers in public areas. There are also [[exhibitions]], [[festivals]], and [[competitions]] where independent strippers are more likely to be [[perform]]ing. [[Nudes-A-Poppin']] is a popular festival scheduled annually which features both female and male dancers competing in erotic dance. Outside the U.S., the use of strip clubs to facilitate sex for hire is much more common, and stripping is viewed in those settings as [[advertising]] for sexually oriented services performed in private areas of the club or off [[premises]].\n\n==Performance==\n\nWhile working, a stripper is not necessarily required to remove all of her or his clothing. Regardless of size, name, or location in the world, strip clubs can be full nude, topless or bikini.<ref name=\"Frank 2002a\">{{citation | last = Frank | first = Katherine | contribution = Laurelton and its strip clubs: the historical, physical, and social terrain | editor-last = Frank | editor-first = Katherine | title = G-strings and sympathy: strip club regulars and male desire | pages = 57\u201378 | publisher = Duke University Press | location = Durham | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780822329725 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}</ref><ref name=\"StPete Bikini 2010\">{{cite news |last1= Stanley |first1= Kameel |title= Police raid downtown St. Petersburg bikini bar |url= http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/article1100220.ece |work= [[Tampa Bay Times|St. Petersburg Times]] |date= 5 June 2010 |accessdate= 8 June 2010 |archive-date= 9 June 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100609043122/http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/article1100220.ece  }}</ref> For any type of strip club there are exceptions based on the individual dancer and management, and clubs are classified based on typical performances, zoning, and advertised services.\n\n===Style of dress===\nIn some localities, strippers are required to obtain permits to work in adult entertainment.<ref name=\"ALC 24K 2009\">{{cite news | last = Matteucci | first = Megan | title = Police: Strip club offered drugs, sex | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120806062930/http://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta/police-strip-club-offered-170255.html | archive-date = 6 August 2012 | url = http://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta/police-strip-club-offered-170255.html | work = [[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] | date = 22 October 2009 | accessdate = 13 August 2010}}</ref> During a bikini performance, both [[breasts]] and [[genital#Genitals|genital]] areas typically remain covered by revealing [[attire]], while dancers provide services and entertainment.

Go-go dancers will retain their tops and bottoms for the duration of their performance. What differentiates a [[bikini]] dancer from other types of performers is the degree to which her body is exposed.\n\nThe stripper, in the case of a bikini performance, may begin with [[layered clothing|layers of clothing]] worn over the bikini which then would be removed during the course of the dance set. When a bikini performance is being performed, many dancers will forgo a [[garter (stockings)|garter]] because they can accept tips at various points in their outfit (typically at the waist or hip or over their [[ribcage]]). A bikini performance is far more likely to be performed by a female than a male given [[social norms]] throughout the world. It has been debated whether or not bikini clubs and performances should count as [[striptease]], but there is little contention over its classification as exotic dance. The phrase ''Go-Go'' was adopted by bars in the 1960s in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. It was of lesser reputation until it was appropriated by [[American burlesque]] and striptease establishments, which in turn became known as ''[[go go bar|go-go bars]]'' and the women working there known as ''Go-Go dancers''.\n\nIn many clubs, while a stripper is walking the floor she will be required to wear her full [[bikini top]] and bottom. When a stripper performs personal services (such as lap or [[bed dances]]) where she comes into contact with a [[customer]], she would also be required to remain in her bikini in more [[restrictive]] club environments. Private dances in particular are scrutinized to ensure that no club policies or [[local ordinance]]s are being [[infraction|violated]] during the [[performance]]. The additional clothing also acts as a deterrent to prevent a customer from exceeding the [[personal boundaries|boundaries]] set by a particular dancer. On 19 June 1964, [[Carol Doda]] began go-go dancing [[toplessness|topless]] at the [[Condor Club]] on Broadway and Columbus in the [[North Beach, San Francisco|North Beach]] neighborhood of [[San Francisco]].<ref name=\"CondorClub\">{{cite news | title = Nudity, noise pay off in Bay Area night clubs | url = http://latimes.com/ | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = 14 February 1965 | page = G5 }}</ref> She became the [[world]]'s most famous go-go dancer, and a prototype for the modern stripper, while dancing at the Condor for 22 years.<ref name=\"DiNardo Gilded 2007\">{{cite book | last = DiNardo | first = Kelly | title = Gilded Lili: Lili St. Cyr and the striptease mystique | publisher = Back Stage Books | location = New York | year = 2007 | isbn = 9780823088898 | url = https://archive.org/details/gildedlilililist00dina_0 }} [https://archive.org/details/gildedlilililist00dina_0 Details.]</ref>\n\n====Topless====\n{{Main|Toplessness#Entertainment and media|l1=Toplessness}}\nWomen are at times employed in adult-only venues to perform or pose topless in forms of commercial erotic entertainment. Such venues can range from downmarket strip clubs to upmarket [[cabarets]], such as the [[Moulin Rouge]]. A stripper whose [[torso|upper body]] is exposed but the [[genital#Genitals|genital]] areas remain obscured during a [[performance]] is said to be topless. Topless entertainment may also include competitions such as [[wet T-shirt contest]]s in which women display their breasts through translucent wet fabric\u2014and may end up removing their T-shirts before the audience. Strippers can engage in these alternate topless activities at sanctioned times inside the club or as independent contractors at outside venues. Not all strippers are comfortable dancing [[toplessness|topless]]. In areas where choice in formats exist, exotic dancers express concern that the more they offer in their performance (nudity included) the more they stand to profit.\n\nEven the dancers that will go topless have been known to stay covered during a dance during slow periods in the club with few customers. This is particularly true if the customers do not appear to be engaged or actively tipping because they are not being [[remuneration|compensated]] for their time on stage. The practice of topless dancing is [[banned]] in many [[jurisdiction]]s, but strippers have been known to work around the [[regulation|constraints]] by selectively uncovering her breasts \"peek-a-boo\" style for short periods of time then replacing the clothing. For a [[male stripper|male dancer]], a [[Toplessness|bare chest]] is not considered in the same light and does not face the same [[legal]] [[regulation|restriction]]s. During a show where customer tipping is permitted, most strip clubs limit contact with a dancer's [[breasts]] to one way\u2014from dancer to customer. Many clubs do not allow any breast contact, and some go so far as to place markers on stage that a dancer is not permitted to cross while nude. This [[physical property|physical]] separation enforces [[regulatory compliance|compliance]] with the no-touch [[policy]].\n\n====Full nudity====\n[[File:Condor Club.jpg|thumb|267px|Historical marker at the original [[Condor Club]] site.

The practice is banned in many jurisdictions, but many dancers will work around the [[regulation|constraint]]s by selectively uncovering her [[vulva]], [[Human anus|anus]], or both for short periods of time then replacing the clothing. For a male dancer, exposing the [[Human penis|penis]] or anus is equivalent. Many dancers prefer to leave their clothing on their bodies once they have shifted them from their private areas. In some cases this disguises [[scar|blemish]]es or areas of their figure they are not comfortable with, or could simply be to prevent those parts of the outfit from being misplaced.\n\nNot all strippers are comfortable dancing fully nude. If viewed as a [[continuum (theory)|continuum]], fewer dancers will dance topless than go-go and fewer still would dance fully nude. It has been reported when in direct competition with more conservative offerings, fully nude formats are seen by customers as a superior enough substitute for them to switch clubs.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bell |first=Tom |title=Sex & the country |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130321050321/http://www.pressherald.com/news/sex_2010-03-13.html |archive-date=21 March 2013 |url=http://www.pressherald.com/news/sex_2010-03-13.html |work=[[Portland Press Herald]] |date=14 March 2010 |access-date=30 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In areas where choice in formats exist, exotic dancers express concern that the more they offer in their performance (nudity included) the more they stand to [[profit (economics)|profit]].

Where nude private dances are allowed with contact, some dancers choose to place some type of barrier (cloth or occasionally [[plastic]]) over the customer's [[lap]] as a precautionary measure.\n\n===Customer interaction===\nStrippers are focused on making money from customers. How dancers go about maximizing revenue varies. For customers they do not already know, dancers use factors such as [[clothing]], [[shoes]], age, and [[ethnicity|race]] to determine whom they wish to interact with. Dancers and owners are always in agreement on the objective of making money. Strip clubs are profit-oriented businesses like [[restaurants]] and other [[retail]] establishments and dancers are their primary enabler to encourage potential patrons to spend time in their establishment. The dancers continually interact with the customers in the club by walking around and attempting to solicit drinks and lap dances, usually scanning the floor of a club to find the most lucrative customer to target.<ref name=\"Wosick-Correa 2008\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Wosick-Correa | first1 = Kassia R. | last2 = Joseph | first2 = Lauren J. | title = Sexy ladies sexing ladies: women as consumers in strip clubs | journal = [[Journal of Sex Research]] | volume = 45 | issue = 3 | pages = 201\u2013216 | doi = 10.1080/00224490801987432 | pmid = 18686149 | date = 2008 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\nWhile clubs can generate revenue through means such as cover charges and drink fees, dancers make most of their profit from giving lap dances or VIP dances where regulations allow. Otherwise, customer tips to dancers from a stage set are their primary form of payment per shift. The dancer qualifies a customer by sizing up their [[human physical appearance|appearance]] and personal characteristics. Once the dancer identifies her mark, she approaches and attempts to create a false social relationship with her customer using tactical interactions and manipulations toward a result of monetary gain. Customers can make the first move and engage the dancer directly, but more experienced dancers will have seen most of their tactics already. Strippers appeal to [[masculine]] desires, but they can adapt to fit the needs of female patrons to view them as customers. Adapting the experience to the [[customer]] is an integral part of exotic dancing.<ref name=\"Wosick-Correa 2008\"/>\n\n==Social factors==\nThere is no one \"stripper lifestyle\" where all striptease practitioners fit neatly into a single [[stereotype]]. There is, however, an archetypal commonality in their presentation and the experience performers face on the job. The impact of these experiences are far reaching, and can continue to affect how the stripper approaches aspects of her life long after her days of actively stripping have concluded. Research on strippers has examined erotic dancing as a type of sex work in larger sociocultural context, gender, sex roles, and perceived appropriateness of behavior. Findings include that while both men and women prefer sex in a relationship, men are more accepting of casual intimacy and sex than some women. The male sexual desire being more likely to allow for casual sex makes men more susceptible to the fantasy intimacy that exotic dancers sell than a female audience, but there are always exceptions. Some women tend to fantasize about partners and relationships, while some men are more commonly contented through lust and physical gratification that strippers can offer through personal attention or possibly private dances.<ref name=\"Bernard 2003\"/>\n\n===Mainstreaming===\nIn the 21st century, as adult themes and work are becoming more commonplace, more of the population is attracted to this type of work.<ref name=AVNPornJust>{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Porn is just one 'sex work' way to cover college tuition | url = http://business.avn.com/articles/video/Porn-is-Just-One-Sex-Work-Way-to-Cover-College-Tuition-550396.html | work = [[AVN (magazine)|Adult Video News]] | accessdate = 3 March 2014}}</ref> For example, a [[University of Leeds]] study, published by the [[British Journal of Sociology|British Journal of Sociology of Education]], revealed that as many as one third of \"strip club dancers are students, with many using the cash earned to support themselves throughout their studies\" and likely to come from [[middle class]] backgrounds.<ref name=\"THE2014\">{{cite news | last = Grove | first = Jack | title = Acceptable face of 'party night' striptease | url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/acceptable-face-of-party-night-striptease/2011637.article | work = [[Times Higher Education]] | accessdate= 3 March 2014}}</ref> The study also stated that \"students were now a 'core supply group into the sex industries', with clubs even targeting [[freshers' week]] events with recruitment leaflets.\"<ref name=\"THE2014\"/> This is supported by a 2014 story in the [[New York Daily News]] regarding [[San Francisco]] strip clubs taking out recruitment ads in the university newspaper for the [[University of California at Berkeley]], ''[[The Daily Californian]]''.<ref name=NYDNRecruit>{{cite news | last = Taylor | first = Victoria | title = San Francisco strip clubs place recruitment ad in college newspaper | url = http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/strip-clubs-place-recruitment-ad-college-newspaper-article-1.1698709 | work = [[New York Daily News]] | date = 22 February 2014 | accessdate = 3 March 2014}}</ref> One distinction made is that many view working as a strip club dancer as a short-term means to address financial needs, while others view it as a profession and go on to other types of [[sex work]] such as performing in [[adult film]]s.<ref name=\"THE2014\"/>\n\n===Work-life balance===\nResearch suggests that exotic dancing can pay well, but often at a significant cost<ref name=\"Ronai and Ellis 1989\"/> to the stripper. The reason for this is because of the negative stigma associated with exotic dancing. When revealing one's occupation, a person may be seeking immediate social acceptance from others. However, when an occupation is considered illegal, immoral, or improper, social acceptance is not granted.<ref name=\"Ritzer 1977\">{{cite book | last = Ritzer | first = George | title = Working, conflict and change | publisher = Prentice-Hall | location = Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey | year = 1977 | isbn = 9780139676383 | edition = 2nd | url = https://archive.org/details/workingconflictc00ritz_0 }}</ref> Dancers manage this stigma by \"divid[ing] the social world\" by only revealing part of their identity.<ref name=\"Thompson and Harred 1992\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Thompson | first1 = William E. | last2 = Harred | first2 = Jackie L. | title = Topless dancers: managing stigma in a deviant occupation | journal = [[Deviant Behavior (journal)|Deviant Behavior]] | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 291\u2013311 | doi = 10.1080/01639625.1992.9967914 | date = 1992 | ref = harv }}</ref> By revealing only a part of their identity, strippers attempt to avoid being characterized by the stigmatizing attributes associated with exotic dancing.<ref name=\"Bernard 2003\"/> Within the context of the strip club, dancers sometimes give the impression that they are revealing private information, or ''[[theater (structure)#On and off stage|backstage]]'' information to a customer in order to play the [[confidence game]] for increased profit.<ref name=\"Wosick-Correa 2008\"/>\n\nA customer often wants a dancer to \"drop the act,\" which makes the customer feel special and desired.<ref name=\"Ronai and Ellis 1989\"/><ref name=\"Frank 2002\">{{cite book | last = Frank | first = Katherine | title = G-strings and sympathy: strip club regulars and male desire | publisher = Duke University Press | location = Durham | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780822329725 }}</ref> Dancers are aware of this customer [[desire (emotion)|desire]] for increased confidence, and a dancer therefore will give off the impression that a customer is seeing her true self, when in reality it is just part of her act.<ref name=\"Frank 2002\"/> Dancers also maintain their \"[[persona|front]]\" by creating a carefully crafted illusion of attractiveness and sexual appeal for customers in the club. Dancers use props such as make-up, clothing, costumes, and appealing fragrances to complete their character. Customers rarely if ever see the preparation of these props; they are denied access to the backstage of a dancer's performance through the layout of the club.<ref name=\"Wosick-Correa 2008\"/> Though the experience as a stripper has been documented in journalistic and academic research to have lasting negative impacts on practitioners, being a stripper does not preclude a [[work life balance|balanced life]] while in the business or personally satisfying future.\n\n===Boundaries and etiquette===\n[[File:Models in Break Area at Miami Eroticaxxx 2009.jpg|thumb|right|Performers [[theater (structure)#On and off stage|backstage]] tending to their props away from the audience]]\nOutside the club, dancers are indistinguishable by [[human physical appearance|appearance]] from the [[demographic analysis#Population Composition|general population]] and no more likely to be the targets of acts like [[violent crime]] than non-strippers.<ref name=\"Kelvin 2007\">{{cite book | last = Kevlin | first = T.A. | title = Headless man in topless bar: studies of 725 cases of strip club related criminal homicides | publisher = Dog Ear Publishing | location = Indianapolis, Indiana | year = 2007 | isbn = 9781598583243 }}</ref> Inside the club [[personal boundaries]] are frequently crossed between strippers, customers, and other club staff.

Because of the non-physical motivations ascribed to female intimacy, dancers select women to approach who are smiling and sitting comfortably with open body language such as uncrossed arms, actively participating with the crowd, laughing and engaging with fellow customers, and applauding for dancers at the main stage also increase the likelihood they will be approached. Dancers tend to avoid women with unfriendly facial expressions or visibly hostile body language, again regardless of sexual orientation. In order to become approached, men must indicate financial potential through their appearance. Women must demonstrate their good attitude and willingness to participate in club activities. At that point, a woman's perceived profitability is also a factor in a dancer's decision to approach a female patron. The presence of male companionship has been cited in research as an indicator used by dancers to gauge the profitability of a female once she is perceived to be a customer.<ref name=\"Wosick-Correa 2008\"/>\n\n===In popular culture===\n{{essay-like|section|date=April 2015}}\nThe image of strippers as known today evolved through the late [[striptease#1960s-1970s|1960s and 1970s]] in the U.S. and international cultures which embraced Americanized striptease, introduced into popular culture by the genre-defining performances of [[Carol Doda]] at the [[Condor Club]] in [[San Francisco]], [[California]].\n\n====Film, television, and theater====\nBy the 1980s, Americans began to love the pole-dancing and highly sexual imagery associated with today's performers was widely accepted and frequently portrayed in film, television, and theater.\n\n=====1980s\u20131990s=====\nIn addition to lesser-known videos, the 1980s also featured mainstream films involving strippers and their work as part of the central narrative.

An instrumental, \"[[The Stripper]]\", was a [[No. 1 hit]] on the U.S. pop singles charts for [[David Rose (musician)|David Rose and His Orchestra]] in 1962. That song pre-dated the opening of what is considered to be the first modern strip club, [[Condor Club]] on [[Broadway Street (San Francisco)|Broadway]] in the U.S. city of [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. \"[[Private Dancer (Tina Turner song)|Private Dancer]]\" by [[Tina Turner]] was an international hit and her second highest charting single reaching No. 7 on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. \"[[Girls, Girls, Girls (M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce song)|Girls, Girls, Girls]]\" by [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]] was also a Top 20 hit on the U.S. charts.\n\n[[T-Pain]] had a No. 5 hit on the Billboard chats with \"[[I'm 'n Luv (Wit a Stripper)]]\" in 2006. Hip hop artist [[Flo Rida]] had two No. 1 hits in the U.S. in the 2000s with \"[[Right Round]]\" and \"[[Low (Flo Rida song)|Low]]\". For both hip-hop artists, the depictions of strippers and expressions of lust are far more explicit than in songs released in earlier music eras. This is not limited to hip-hop, with contemporary songs in other styles of music sharing similar traits. \"Worked Up So Sexual\" by [[The Faint]] is graphic in its depiction of dancer rivalry (''older dancers gag at what new talent seems to mean, smaller tits and younger limbs'') and customers longing to bed them. Public acceptance of the music has not faltered, and many dancers perform to these and other songs depicting women in subjectively negative ways while on stage.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n====Video games====\n''[[Duke Nukem 3D]]'', released in 1996, became the original pioneer video game for the inclusion of strippers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fabiensanglard.net/duke3d/id%20as%20Super-Ego-%20The%20Creation%20of%20Duke%20Nukem%203D.pdf |title=id as Super-Ego: The Creation of Duke Nukem 3D |first=Rene |last=Patnode |date=22 March 2001 |access-date=21 October 2018 |pages=48 |work=Fabien Sanglard's Website}}</ref> ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' (2004) was the first video game of the [[Grand Theft Auto|saga]] to include strippers.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/11/07/playpen_strip_club_versus_gta_pig_pen/ |title=First Amendment rescues Grand Theft Auto's 'totally nude' strip club |first=Austin |last=Modine |date=7 November 2008 |access-date=21 October 2018 |work=[[The Register]]}}</ref> ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'' (2008) includes a [[strip club]] where the player can mingle with the strippers.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-4s-open-world-is-still-fantastic-/1100-6458753/ |title=Grand Theft Auto 4's Open World Is Still Fantastic 10 Years Later |first=Alessandro |last=Fillari |date=19 May 2018 |access-date=21 October 2018 |work=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive Inc.]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/5-cool-things-you-missed-in-gta-iv/2/ |title=5 Cool Things You Missed in GTA IV |first=Charlie |last=Barratt |date=16 August 2008 |access-date=21 October 2018 |work=[[Games Radar]] |page=2 |publisher=[[Future Publishing Limited]]}}</ref> In ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' (2013) the character can visit Vanila Unicorn and takes [[lap dance]]s with the strippers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vg247.com/2015/09/15/gta-online-frame-rate-patch-fix/ |title=GTA Online fix tackles frame rate, bugs and freezing strippers |first=Matt |last=Martin |date=15 September 2015 |access-date=21 October 2018 |work=[[vg247]]}}</ref> In the online version, the player can flirt with the stripper by using their voice on the [[microphone]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://metro.co.uk/2013/10/28/gta-online-gamer-heard-flirting-with-stripper-in-cringeworthy-video-4164297/ |title=GTA Online gamer heard flirting with stripper in cringeworthy video |first=Christopher |last=Hooton |date=28 October 2013 |publisher=[[Associated Newspapers Limited]] |newspaper=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.com:80/in-grand-theft-auto-v-if-you-flirt-with-the-strippers-using-the-microphone-other-players-can-hear-you-2013-10 |title=In Grand Theft Auto V, If You Flirt With The Strippers Using The Microphone Other Players Can Hear You |first=Jim |last=Edwards |date=29 October 2013 |access-date=21 October 2018 |work=[[Business Insider]] |publisher=[[Insider Inc.]]}}</ref>\n\n==Legal issues==\n{{Main|Legal status of striptease}}\nFrom ancient times to the present day, striptease has been considered a form of [[public nudity]] and subject to legal and cultural prohibitions on [[morality|moral]] and [[indecent exposure|decency]] grounds.\n\n===Laws and court cases===\nMany U.S. jurisdictions have specific laws on the books related to striptease, with more being added increasing both complexity of enforcement and impact.

Among its provisions is the \"six foot rule\", copied by other municipalities in requiring that dancers maintain a six-foot distance while performing.\n\nTouching of performers is illegal in many U.S. states. However, some dancers and some clubs condone touching of dancers during private dances. This touching often includes the fondling of breasts, buttocks, and in rare cases the vaginal region. In some locales, dancers may give a customer a \"lap dance\", whereby the dancer grinds against the customer's crotch while they are fully clothed in an attempt to arouse them or bring them to climax. Other rules forbid \"full nudity\". In some parts of the USA, there are laws forbidding the exposure of female nipples, which have thus to be covered by pasties by the dancer (though not applied to the exposure of male nipples).

Since then, male strippers have also become common, but strippers are still overwhelmingly female. Certain male and female strippers also perform for [[LGBT]] audiences as well as for both sexes in [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] contexts. Before the 1970s, dancers of both sexes appeared largely in underground clubs or as part of a [[theatre]] experience, but the practice eventually became common enough on its own. Performances are usually fully choreographed, involve dance routines and a costume of some sort.<ref name=\"What Does A Male Stripper Do?\">{{cite web | last = Carrier | first = Brandon | title = What does a male stripper do?

The [[physical attractiveness]] and [[sex appeal]] of the dancer determines the business the stripper tends to generate. There are no job prerequisites; formal training is minimal, primarily on the job and provided by more senior dancers. Dancers learn a set of rules, such as: never leave money unattended; never leave the club with a customer; and never refuse a table dance. As long as she can \"sell\" herself, she is capable of becoming an exotic dancer.<ref name=\"Bernard 2003\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Bernard | first1 = Constance | last2 = DeGabrielle | first2 = Christen | last3 = Cartier | first3 = Lynette | last4 = Monk-Turner | first4 = Elizabeth | last5 = Phill | first5 = Celestine | last6 = Sherwood | first6 = Jennifer | last7 = Tyree | first7 = Thomasena | title = Exotic dancers: gender differences in societal reaction, subcultural ties, and conventional support | journal = Journal of Criminal Justice and Popular Culture | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 1\u201311 | date = Winter 2003 | url = http://www.albany.edu/scj/jcjpc/jcjpc_vol10.html#vol10is1 | ref = harv }} [http://www.albany.edu/scj/jcjpc/vol10is1/bernard.pdf PDF].</ref> The image of strippers as known today evolved through the late [[striptease#1960s-1970s|1960s and 1970s]] in the U.S. and international cultures. By the 1980s, the pole dancing and highly-explicit imagery associated with today's performers was widely accepted and frequently portrayed in film, television, and theater. In a bikini performance, both [[breasts]] and [[genital#Genitals|genital]] areas typically remain covered by revealing [[attire]] while dancers provide services and entertainment. [[Go-go dancer]]s will retain their tops and bottoms for the duration of their performance. A stripper whose [[torso|upper body]] is exposed but the [[genital#Genitals|genital]] areas remain obscured during a [[performance]] is said to be topless.\n\nTouching of strippers is not permitted in many localities. However, some dancers and clubs allow touching of dancers during private dances. If permitted, during a lap dance the dancer grinds against the customer's crotch while they remains clothed in an attempt to arouse or bring the recipient to climax.<ref name=\"Bremer 2005\">{{citation | last = Bremer | first = Susan | contribution = The grind | editor-last1 = Egan | editor-first1 = Danielle | editor-last2 = Frank | editor-first2 = Katherine | editor-last3 = Johnson | editor-first3 = Merri | title = Flesh for fantasy: producing and consuming exotic dance | pages = 35\u201352 | publisher = Thunder's Mouth Press.

Due to the common practice of hiring strippers as contractors, not as full-time employees, strippers must deal with extreme job insecurity, unstable pay, no health benefits, and the requirement of paying fees to the club for technically renting their stage. This precarious employment is accepted because of the stigma associated with exotic dancing. Dancers use props such as make-up, clothing, costumes, and appealing fragrances to complete their character and maintain their \"[[persona|front]]\".\n\n===Inside the club===\nStrippers, when working, are most likely to be found at strip clubs. An essential draw of the strip club is the live entertainment, which the vast majority of the time are the strippers. Dancers effectively entertaining customers are the key to generating revenue by keeping the customers on site and enticing them to be repeat visitors. House dancers work for a particular club or [[franchising|franchise]]. Feature dancers tend to have their own [[celebrity]], touring a club circuit and making appearances. [[Pornographic film actor|Porn stars]] will often become feature dancers to earn extra income and build their fan base. High-profile adult film performers [[Jenna Haze]] and Teagan Presley among others have participated in feature shows through the USA, as did now-retired stars such as [[Jenna Jameson]]. Entertainers (dancers) are often not actual employees of the club itself but allowed to perform as independent contractors for a predetermined house fee.\n\nDuring each set of one or more songs, the current performer will dance on stage in exchange for tips. Where legal (or legal restrictions are ignored), dancers may offer additional services such as [[lap dance]]s or a trip to the champagne room for a set fee rather than a tip. Strippers can be contracted for performances outside the strip club environment. Some strippers will only strip for private engagements and do not have a regular affiliation with a strip club. Much like activities inside the club, different dancers have different comfort levels for services they will provide during a private party. Aside from advertising for striptease services outside the club, an unknown percentage of strippers also work in other aspects of the [[sex industry]]. This can include erotic and [[nude photography|nude modeling]], [[pornography]], [[escort agency|escorting]], and in some cases [[prostitution]]. Outside the U.S., the use of strip clubs to facilitate sex for hire is much more common, and stripping is viewed in those settings as [[advertising]] for sexually oriented services performed in private areas of the club or off [[premises]].\n\n====Stage performance====\nMost clubs have a dancer rotation where each dancer in turn will perform for one or more songs in a fixed sequence which repeats during a shift. More informal clubs will have dancers take turns when a stage becomes empty or have a free flow of entertainers where the stage has any number of entertainers who wander off and on at will. Feature entertainers are not usually part of the rotation, and have set times where they will perform that are advertised throughout the shift. If a [[DJ]] is present, they will emcee the rotation and typically announce the current dancer(s) on stage and possibly whom to expect in future sets.\n\n====Tip collection====\nDuring each set of one or more songs, the current performer will dance on stage in exchange for tips. Dancers collect [[tip (gratuity)|tip]]s from customers either while on stage or after the dancer has finished a stage show and is mingling with the audience. A customary tip (where customers can do so at the stage) is a dollar [[paper currency|bill]] folded lengthwise and placed in the dancer's [[garter (stockings)|garter]] from the ''tip rail''. Other common tip methods are to insert the dollar into the stripper's cleavage from the hand or mouth, or to simply place it or toss it onto the stage. Tipping during a stage performance is prohibited by some clubs due to restrictions in local ordinance or past incidents on the premises. Each club and dancer will have individual tolerance levels for customer interaction including tipping. Some clubs will have multiple stages on the premises that dancers will move between, but typically the dancer would collect for her time on the main stage during a rotation. Tips can also be collected during private dances.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wendroff|first=Darren|title=Strip-Club Etiquette|journal= [[Men's Health]] |date=September 2004|volume=19|issue=7|page=86| url = http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/14174771/strip-club-etiquette |accessdate=10 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Private dance====\nWhere legal (or legal restrictions are ignored), dancers may offer additional services such as lap dances or a trip to the champagne room for a set fee rather than a tip. This fee will typically include a set fee for the room, for a set amount of time. Private dances in the main club areas most often take the form of [[table dance]]s, [[lap dance|lap and couch dances]], and bed dances among others. An ''air dance'' is a particular form of private dance where little to no contact between the dancer and customer occurs. This class of dance spans the different categories above, and some dancers can perform air dances when more contact-heavy forms of dance were expected and paid for.\n\nTable dances are distinguished from other forms of dances in that they can be performed where the customer is seated on the main floor. Table dances also refer to a form of minimal touch private dance where the performer is physically located on a small table in front of the customer(s). Table dances should not be confused with table stages, where the stripper is at or above eye level on a platform surrounded by chairs and usually enough table surface for customers to place drinks and tip money. These stages are configured for close viewing of the striptease and are known for dancers lowering themselves from the stage onto customers during their set.\n\nLap dances can be (and are) performed in all manner of seating, ranging from plain stools and kitchen-grade chairs to plush leather armchairs. They can also be performed with the customer standing in these designated areas. A service provided by many clubs is for a customer to be placed on stage with one or more dancers for a public lap dance. Occasions for this type of performance are [[bachelor parties]] and birthdays in the club among others. Bed dances are designed for the customer to be lying down with the entertainer(s) positioned on top of them. Bed dances are the least common of the three, and in many clubs, these are a more expensive option than a lap dance because of the novelty and increased level of contact between customer and service provider.\n\nA ''champagne room'' (also called a ''champagne lounge'' or ''champagne court'') is a specialized VIP Room service offered by gentleman's clubs where a customer can purchase time (usually in half-hour increments) with an exotic dancer in a private room on the premises. Depending on the quality of the club, the room, which is away from the hustle and bustle of the main club, is well decorated and usually has its own bar. Clubs sell [[champagne (wine)|champagne]] by the glass or by the bottle for both the dancer and the customer. Strippers who have multiple trips to VIP in a given [[shift work|shift]] will often give their portion of the alcohol to other dancers or customers to reduce the amount they are drinking themselves.\n\n===Outside the club===\nStrippers can be contracted for performances outside the strip club environment. Some strippers will only strip for private engagements and do not have a regular affiliation with a strip club.\n\n====Bachelor and bachelorette parties====\n{{Main|Bachelor party|Bachelorette party}}\nA [[bachelor party]] may involve activities beyond the usual party and social-gathering ingredients (often drinking [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] and [[gambling]]), such as going to a strip club or hiring a stripper to perform in a private setting like a [[home]] or [[hotel]]. In some traditions, more [[hazing]]-like tests and pranks at the future groom's expense, which shows the whole thing is also a [[rite of passage]] from bachelorhood (associated with an [[adolescent]] lifestyle, often in the common past of most participants, e.g., in their student years) to \"more responsible\" marital life. These pranks can involve a stripper if the entertainer is willing. Bachelor parties have come to symbolize the last time when the groom is free of the influence of his new wife. Some women also participate in a similar party to be held for the bride-to-be. This is known as a [[bachelorette party]] or Hen party. Some also chose instead to hold a so-called [[stag and doe|Stag and Doe]] party in the US or a ''hag party'' or ''hag do'' in the UK (\"hag\" being a [[portmanteau]] \"hen\" and \"stag\"), in which both the bride and groom attend. The female equivalent of a stag party in Canada is often known as a \"stagette\", \"doe\", or \"bachelorette\".\n\n====Private parties====\nPrivate parties are popular events for which to hire strippers. There are many [[entertainment]] businesses that have strippers contracted for private performances. Some of these companies have a national presence, with strippers contracted in multiple states and some who work regionally over a multi-state area. Strippers will also do side work and handle their own [[gentlemen's agreement|agreement]]s and [[payment]] arrangements. Written agreements are atypical in this type of transaction unless a formal, registered business is involved. They could also travel over significant (i.e. flight required) distances for private events and appointments, most of the time passing the cost of travel and [[lodging|accommodation]]s onto the customer. Patrons at the clubs in which the strippers work are a primary source of [[customer]]s for their work outside the club. Much like activities inside the club, different dancers have different comfort levels for services they will provide during a private party.\n\n====Other activities====\nAside from advertising for striptease services outside the club, an unknown percentage of strippers also work in other aspects of the [[sex industry]]. This can include erotic and nude modeling, pornography, escorting, and in some cases prostitution (which is now illegal in all states other than Nevada within the U.S.). These activities are not [[mutually exclusive]], meaning that a stripper who models on the side would be a stripper ''and'' a model.\n\nAdult industry trade shows often have strippers working, though many of them are affiliated with individual companies and not necessarily [[freelancers]]. More [[traditional]] [[industries]] have made use of go-go dancers to provide [[entertainment]] and act as [[bargirl]]s or hostesses. The lack of explicit [[nudity]] makes go-go dancers more socially acceptable than topless and nude performers in public areas. There are also [[exhibitions]], [[festivals]], and [[competitions]] where independent strippers are more likely to be [[perform]]ing. [[Nudes-A-Poppin']] is a popular festival scheduled annually which features both female and male dancers competing in erotic dance. Outside the U.S., the use of strip clubs to facilitate sex for hire is much more common, and stripping is viewed in those settings as [[advertising]] for sexually oriented services performed in private areas of the club or off [[premises]].\n\n==Performance==\n\nWhile working, a stripper is not necessarily required to remove all of her or his clothing. Regardless of size, name, or location in the world, strip clubs can be full nude, topless or bikini.<ref name=\"Frank 2002a\">{{citation | last = Frank | first = Katherine | contribution = Laurelton and its strip clubs: the historical, physical, and social terrain | editor-last = Frank | editor-first = Katherine | title = G-strings and sympathy: strip club regulars and male desire | pages = 57\u201378 | publisher = Duke University Press | location = Durham | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780822329725 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}</ref><ref name=\"StPete Bikini 2010\">{{cite news |last1= Stanley |first1= Kameel |title= Police raid downtown St. Petersburg bikini bar |url= http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/article1100220.ece |work= [[Tampa Bay Times|St. Petersburg Times]] |date= 5 June 2010 |accessdate= 8 June 2010 |archive-date= 9 June 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100609043122/http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/article1100220.ece  }}</ref> For any type of strip club there are exceptions based on the individual dancer and management, and clubs are classified based on typical performances, zoning, and advertised services.\n\n===Style of dress===\nIn some localities, strippers are required to obtain permits to work in adult entertainment.<ref name=\"ALC 24K 2009\">{{cite news | last = Matteucci | first = Megan | title = Police: Strip club offered drugs, sex | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120806062930/http://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta/police-strip-club-offered-170255.html | archive-date = 6 August 2012 | url = http://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta/police-strip-club-offered-170255.html | work = [[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] | date = 22 October 2009 | accessdate = 13 August 2010}}</ref> During a bikini performance, both [[breasts]] and [[genital#Genitals|genital]] areas typically remain covered by revealing [[attire]], while dancers provide services and entertainment.

Go-go dancers will retain their tops and bottoms for the duration of their performance. What differentiates a [[bikini]] dancer from other types of performers is the degree to which her body is exposed.\n\nThe stripper, in the case of a bikini performance, may begin with [[layered clothing|layers of clothing]] worn over the bikini which then would be removed during the course of the dance set. When a bikini performance is being performed, many dancers will forgo a [[garter (stockings)|garter]] because they can accept tips at various points in their outfit (typically at the waist or hip or over their [[ribcage]]). A bikini performance is far more likely to be performed by a female than a male given [[social norms]] throughout the world. It has been debated whether or not bikini clubs and performances should count as [[striptease]], but there is little contention over its classification as exotic dance. The phrase ''Go-Go'' was adopted by bars in the 1960s in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. It was of lesser reputation until it was appropriated by [[American burlesque]] and striptease establishments, which in turn became known as ''[[go go bar|go-go bars]]'' and the women working there known as ''Go-Go dancers''.\n\nIn many clubs, while a stripper is walking the floor she will be required to wear her full [[bikini top]] and bottom. When a stripper performs personal services (such as lap or [[bed dances]]) where she comes into contact with a [[customer]], she would also be required to remain in her bikini in more [[restrictive]] club environments. Private dances in particular are scrutinized to ensure that no club policies or [[local ordinance]]s are being [[infraction|violated]] during the [[performance]]. The additional clothing also acts as a deterrent to prevent a customer from exceeding the [[personal boundaries|boundaries]] set by a particular dancer. On 19 June 1964, [[Carol Doda]] began go-go dancing [[toplessness|topless]] at the [[Condor Club]] on Broadway and Columbus in the [[North Beach, San Francisco|North Beach]] neighborhood of [[San Francisco]].<ref name=\"CondorClub\">{{cite news | title = Nudity, noise pay off in Bay Area night clubs | url = http://latimes.com/ | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = 14 February 1965 | page = G5 }}</ref> She became the [[world]]'s most famous go-go dancer, and a prototype for the modern stripper, while dancing at the Condor for 22 years.<ref name=\"DiNardo Gilded 2007\">{{cite book | last = DiNardo | first = Kelly | title = Gilded Lili: Lili St. Cyr and the striptease mystique | publisher = Back Stage Books | location = New York | year = 2007 | isbn = 9780823088898 | url = https://archive.org/details/gildedlilililist00dina_0 }} [https://archive.org/details/gildedlilililist00dina_0 Details.]</ref>\n\n====Topless====\n{{Main|Toplessness#Entertainment and media|l1=Toplessness}}\nWomen are at times employed in adult-only venues to perform or pose topless in forms of commercial erotic entertainment. Such venues can range from downmarket strip clubs to upmarket [[cabarets]], such as the [[Moulin Rouge]]. A stripper whose [[torso|upper body]] is exposed but the [[genital#Genitals|genital]] areas remain obscured during a [[performance]] is said to be topless. Topless entertainment may also include competitions such as [[wet T-shirt contest]]s in which women display their breasts through translucent wet fabric\u2014and may end up removing their T-shirts before the audience. Strippers can engage in these alternate topless activities at sanctioned times inside the club or as independent contractors at outside venues. Not all strippers are comfortable dancing [[toplessness|topless]]. In areas where choice in formats exist, exotic dancers express concern that the more they offer in their performance (nudity included) the more they stand to profit.\n\nEven the dancers that will go topless have been known to stay covered during a dance during slow periods in the club with few customers. This is particularly true if the customers do not appear to be engaged or actively tipping because they are not being [[remuneration|compensated]] for their time on stage. The practice of topless dancing is [[banned]] in many [[jurisdiction]]s, but strippers have been known to work around the [[regulation|constraints]] by selectively uncovering her breasts \"peek-a-boo\" style for short periods of time then replacing the clothing. For a [[male stripper|male dancer]], a [[Toplessness|bare chest]] is not considered in the same light and does not face the same [[legal]] [[regulation|restriction]]s. During a show where customer tipping is permitted, most strip clubs limit contact with a dancer's [[breasts]] to one way\u2014from dancer to customer. Many clubs do not allow any breast contact, and some go so far as to place markers on stage that a dancer is not permitted to cross while nude. This [[physical property|physical]] separation enforces [[regulatory compliance|compliance]] with the no-touch [[policy]].\n\n====Full nudity====\n[[File:Condor Club.jpg|thumb|267px|Historical marker at the original [[Condor Club]] site.

The practice is banned in many jurisdictions, but many dancers will work around the [[regulation|constraint]]s by selectively uncovering her [[vulva]], [[Human anus|anus]], or both for short periods of time then replacing the clothing. For a male dancer, exposing the [[Human penis|penis]] or anus is equivalent. Many dancers prefer to leave their clothing on their bodies once they have shifted them from their private areas. In some cases this disguises [[scar|blemish]]es or areas of their figure they are not comfortable with, or could simply be to prevent those parts of the outfit from being misplaced.\n\nNot all strippers are comfortable dancing fully nude. If viewed as a [[continuum (theory)|continuum]], fewer dancers will dance topless than go-go and fewer still would dance fully nude. It has been reported when in direct competition with more conservative offerings, fully nude formats are seen by customers as a superior enough substitute for them to switch clubs.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bell |first=Tom |title=Sex & the country |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130321050321/http://www.pressherald.com/news/sex_2010-03-13.html |archive-date=21 March 2013 |url=http://www.pressherald.com/news/sex_2010-03-13.html |work=[[Portland Press Herald]] |date=14 March 2010 |access-date=30 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In areas where choice in formats exist, exotic dancers express concern that the more they offer in their performance (nudity included) the more they stand to [[profit (economics)|profit]].

Where nude private dances are allowed with contact, some dancers choose to place some type of barrier (cloth or occasionally [[plastic]]) over the customer's [[lap]] as a precautionary measure.\n\n===Customer interaction===\nStrippers are focused on making money from customers. How dancers go about maximizing revenue varies. For customers they do not already know, dancers use factors such as [[clothing]], [[shoes]], age, and [[ethnicity|race]] to determine whom they wish to interact with. Dancers and owners are always in agreement on the objective of making money. Strip clubs are profit-oriented businesses like [[restaurants]] and other [[retail]] establishments and dancers are their primary enabler to encourage potential patrons to spend time in their establishment. The dancers continually interact with the customers in the club by walking around and attempting to solicit drinks and lap dances, usually scanning the floor of a club to find the most lucrative customer to target.<ref name=\"Wosick-Correa 2008\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Wosick-Correa | first1 = Kassia R. | last2 = Joseph | first2 = Lauren J. | title = Sexy ladies sexing ladies: women as consumers in strip clubs | journal = [[Journal of Sex Research]] | volume = 45 | issue = 3 | pages = 201\u2013216 | doi = 10.1080/00224490801987432 | pmid = 18686149 | date = 2008 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\nWhile clubs can generate revenue through means such as cover charges and drink fees, dancers make most of their profit from giving lap dances or VIP dances where regulations allow. Otherwise, customer tips to dancers from a stage set are their primary form of payment per shift. The dancer qualifies a customer by sizing up their [[human physical appearance|appearance]] and personal characteristics. Once the dancer identifies her mark, she approaches and attempts to create a false social relationship with her customer using tactical interactions and manipulations toward a result of monetary gain. Customers can make the first move and engage the dancer directly, but more experienced dancers will have seen most of their tactics already. Strippers appeal to [[masculine]] desires, but they can adapt to fit the needs of female patrons to view them as customers. Adapting the experience to the [[customer]] is an integral part of exotic dancing.<ref name=\"Wosick-Correa 2008\"/>\n\n==Social factors==\nThere is no one \"stripper lifestyle\" where all striptease practitioners fit neatly into a single [[stereotype]]. There is, however, an archetypal commonality in their presentation and the experience performers face on the job. The impact of these experiences are far reaching, and can continue to affect how the stripper approaches aspects of her life long after her days of actively stripping have concluded. Research on strippers has examined erotic dancing as a type of sex work in larger sociocultural context, gender, sex roles, and perceived appropriateness of behavior. Findings include that while both men and women prefer sex in a relationship, men are more accepting of casual intimacy and sex than some women. The male sexual desire being more likely to allow for casual sex makes men more susceptible to the fantasy intimacy that exotic dancers sell than a female audience, but there are always exceptions. Some women tend to fantasize about partners and relationships, while some men are more commonly contented through lust and physical gratification that strippers can offer through personal attention or possibly private dances.<ref name=\"Bernard 2003\"/>\n\n===Mainstreaming===\nIn the 21st century, as adult themes and work are becoming more commonplace, more of the population is attracted to this type of work.<ref name=AVNPornJust>{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Porn is just one 'sex work' way to cover college tuition | url = http://business.avn.com/articles/video/Porn-is-Just-One-Sex-Work-Way-to-Cover-College-Tuition-550396.html | work = [[AVN (magazine)|Adult Video News]] | accessdate = 3 March 2014}}</ref> For example, a [[University of Leeds]] study, published by the [[British Journal of Sociology|British Journal of Sociology of Education]], revealed that as many as one third of \"strip club dancers are students, with many using the cash earned to support themselves throughout their studies\" and likely to come from [[middle class]] backgrounds.<ref name=\"THE2014\">{{cite news | last = Grove | first = Jack | title = Acceptable face of 'party night' striptease | url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/acceptable-face-of-party-night-striptease/2011637.article | work = [[Times Higher Education]] | accessdate= 3 March 2014}}</ref> The study also stated that \"students were now a 'core supply group into the sex industries', with clubs even targeting [[freshers' week]] events with recruitment leaflets.\"<ref name=\"THE2014\"/> This is supported by a 2014 story in the [[New York Daily News]] regarding [[San Francisco]] strip clubs taking out recruitment ads in the university newspaper for the [[University of California at Berkeley]], ''[[The Daily Californian]]''.<ref name=NYDNRecruit>{{cite news | last = Taylor | first = Victoria | title = San Francisco strip clubs place recruitment ad in college newspaper | url = http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/strip-clubs-place-recruitment-ad-college-newspaper-article-1.1698709 | work = [[New York Daily News]] | date = 22 February 2014 | accessdate = 3 March 2014}}</ref> One distinction made is that many view working as a strip club dancer as a short-term means to address financial needs, while others view it as a profession and go on to other types of [[sex work]] such as performing in [[adult film]]s.<ref name=\"THE2014\"/>\n\n===Work-life balance===\nResearch suggests that exotic dancing can pay well, but often at a significant cost<ref name=\"Ronai and Ellis 1989\"/> to the stripper.

Because of the non-physical motivations ascribed to female intimacy, dancers select women to approach who are smiling and sitting comfortably with open body language such as uncrossed arms, actively participating with the crowd, laughing and engaging with fellow customers, and applauding for dancers at the main stage also increase the likelihood they will be approached. Dancers tend to avoid women with unfriendly facial expressions or visibly hostile body language, again regardless of sexual orientation. In order to become approached, men must indicate financial potential through their appearance. Women must demonstrate their good attitude and willingness to participate in club activities. At that point, a woman's perceived profitability is also a factor in a dancer's decision to approach a female patron. The presence of male companionship has been cited in research as an indicator used by dancers to gauge the profitability of a female once she is perceived to be a customer.<ref name=\"Wosick-Correa 2008\"/>\n\n===In popular culture===\n{{essay-like|section|date=April 2015}}\nThe image of strippers as known today evolved through the late [[striptease#1960s-1970s|1960s and 1970s]] in the U.S. and international cultures which embraced Americanized striptease, introduced into popular culture by the genre-defining performances of [[Carol Doda]] at the [[Condor Club]] in [[San Francisco]], [[California]].\n\n====Film, television, and theater====\nBy the 1980s, Americans began to love the pole-dancing and highly sexual imagery associated with today's performers was widely accepted and frequently portrayed in film, television, and theater.\n\n=====1980s\u20131990s=====\nIn addition to lesser-known videos, the 1980s also featured mainstream films involving strippers and their work as part of the central narrative.

An instrumental, \"[[The Stripper]]\", was a [[No. 1 hit]] on the U.S. pop singles charts for [[David Rose (musician)|David Rose and His Orchestra]] in 1962. That song pre-dated the opening of what is considered to be the first modern strip club, [[Condor Club]] on [[Broadway Street (San Francisco)|Broadway]] in the U.S. city of [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. \"[[Private Dancer (Tina Turner song)|Private Dancer]]\" by [[Tina Turner]] was an international hit and her second highest charting single reaching No. 7 on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. \"[[Girls, Girls, Girls (M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce song)|Girls, Girls, Girls]]\" by [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]] was also a Top 20 hit on the U.S. charts.\n\n[[T-Pain]] had a No. 5 hit on the Billboard chats with \"[[I'm 'n Luv (Wit a Stripper)]]\" in 2006. Hip hop artist [[Flo Rida]] had two No. 1 hits in the U.S. in the 2000s with \"[[Right Round]]\" and \"[[Low (Flo Rida song)|Low]]\". For both hip-hop artists, the depictions of strippers and expressions of lust are far more explicit than in songs released in earlier music eras. This is not limited to hip-hop, with contemporary songs in other styles of music sharing similar traits. \"Worked Up So Sexual\" by [[The Faint]] is graphic in its depiction of dancer rivalry (''older dancers gag at what new talent seems to mean, smaller tits and younger limbs'') and customers longing to bed them. Public acceptance of the music has not faltered, and many dancers perform to these and other songs depicting women in subjectively negative ways while on stage.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n====Video games====\n''[[Duke Nukem 3D]]'', released in 1996, became the original pioneer video game for the inclusion of strippers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fabiensanglard.net/duke3d/id%20as%20Super-Ego-%20The%20Creation%20of%20Duke%20Nukem%203D.pdf |title=id as Super-Ego: The Creation of Duke Nukem 3D |first=Rene |last=Patnode |date=22 March 2001 |access-date=21 October 2018 |pages=48 |work=Fabien Sanglard's Website}}</ref> ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' (2004) was the first video game of the [[Grand Theft Auto|saga]] to include strippers.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/11/07/playpen_strip_club_versus_gta_pig_pen/ |title=First Amendment rescues Grand Theft Auto's 'totally nude' strip club |first=Austin |last=Modine |date=7 November 2008 |access-date=21 October 2018 |work=[[The Register]]}}</ref> ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'' (2008) includes a [[strip club]] where the player can mingle with the strippers.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-4s-open-world-is-still-fantastic-/1100-6458753/ |title=Grand Theft Auto 4's Open World Is Still Fantastic 10 Years Later |first=Alessandro |last=Fillari |date=19 May 2018 |access-date=21 October 2018 |work=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive Inc.]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/5-cool-things-you-missed-in-gta-iv/2/ |title=5 Cool Things You Missed in GTA IV |first=Charlie |last=Barratt |date=16 August 2008 |access-date=21 October 2018 |work=[[Games Radar]] |page=2 |publisher=[[Future Publishing Limited]]}}</ref> In ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' (2013) the character can visit Vanila Unicorn and takes [[lap dance]]s with the strippers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vg247.com/2015/09/15/gta-online-frame-rate-patch-fix/ |title=GTA Online fix tackles frame rate, bugs and freezing strippers |first=Matt |last=Martin |date=15 September 2015 |access-date=21 October 2018 |work=[[vg247]]}}</ref> In the online version, the player can flirt with the stripper by using their voice on the [[microphone]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://metro.co.uk/2013/10/28/gta-online-gamer-heard-flirting-with-stripper-in-cringeworthy-video-4164297/ |title=GTA Online gamer heard flirting with stripper in cringeworthy video |first=Christopher |last=Hooton |date=28 October 2013 |publisher=[[Associated Newspapers Limited]] |newspaper=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.com:80/in-grand-theft-auto-v-if-you-flirt-with-the-strippers-using-the-microphone-other-players-can-hear-you-2013-10 |title=In Grand Theft Auto V, If You Flirt With The Strippers Using The Microphone Other Players Can Hear You |first=Jim |last=Edwards |date=29 October 2013 |access-date=21 October 2018 |work=[[Business Insider]] |publisher=[[Insider Inc.]]}}</ref>\n\n==Legal issues==\n{{Main|Legal status of striptease}}\nFrom ancient times to the present day, striptease has been considered a form of [[public nudity]] and subject to legal and cultural prohibitions on [[morality|moral]] and [[indecent exposure|decency]] grounds.\n\n===Laws and court cases===\nMany U.S. jurisdictions have specific laws on the books related to striptease, with more being added increasing both complexity of enforcement and impact. For example, the classification of dancers as independent contractors has been challenged in court, successfully in Massachusetts in 2009.<ref>{{cite web | title = Commonwealth of Massachusetts Superior Court Civil Action No. 07-505 ''Lucienne Chaves & another'' vs. ''King Arthur's Lounge Inc.'' | url = http://www.llrlaw.com/pdfs/king_arthur_decision.pdf | website = llrlaw.com | publisher = Litchen & Liss-Riordan, P.C. | date = 7 August 2009 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120323163835/http://www.llrlaw.com/pdfs/king_arthur_decision.pdf | archivedate = 23 March 2012 }}</ref> One of the more notorious local ordinances is San Diego Municipal Code 33.3610,<ref>{{cite web | title = San Diego Municipal Code\u2014Chapter 3: Business Regulations, Business Taxes, Permits and Licenses | url = http://docs.sandiego.gov/municode/MuniCodeChapter03/Ch03Art03Division36.pdf | publisher = The City of San Diego | date = November 2000 }}</ref> specific and strict in response to allegations of corruption among local officials<ref>{{cite news | last = LaVelle | first = Philip J. | title = More bad news?

Among its provisions is the \"six foot rule\", copied by other municipalities in requiring that dancers maintain a six-foot distance while performing.\n\nTouching of performers is illegal in many U.S. states. However, some dancers and some clubs condone touching of dancers during private dances. This touching often includes the fondling of breasts, buttocks, and in rare cases the vaginal region. In some locales, dancers may give a customer a \"lap dance\", whereby the dancer grinds against the customer's crotch while they are fully clothed in an attempt to arouse them or bring them to climax. Other rules forbid \"full nudity\". In some parts of the USA, there are laws forbidding the exposure of female nipples, which have thus to be covered by pasties by the dancer (though not applied to the exposure of male nipples). In early 2010, the U.S. city of Detroit, Michigan banned fully exposed breasts in its strip clubs, following the example of Houston, Texas who began enforcing a similar ordinance in 2008.<ref name=\"VicTimes 2008\">{{cite web | title = Houston topless clubs lose case, may respond to Supreme Court with pasties | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303192107/http://www.canada.com/victoriatimescolonist/story.html?k=71554&id=38135a7b-209a-41ef-a325-80435be65732 | archive-date = 3 March 2016 | url = http://www.canada.com/victoriatimescolonist/story.html?k=71554&id=38135a7b-209a-41ef-a325-80435be65732 | website = canada.com/victoriatimescolonist | publisher = Victoria Times | accessdate = 20 October 2004 | date = 29 March 2008 }}</ref> The Detroit city council has since softened the rules eliminating the requirement for pasties<ref name=\"ClickOnDet 2010\">{{cite web |title=Detroit passes new strip club rules | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110609032414/http://www.clickondetroit.com/news/22628122/detail.html | archive-date = 9 June 2011 | url = http://www.clickondetroit.com/news/22628122/detail.html |accessdate= 20 October 2004 | website = clickondetroit.com | publisher =ClickOn Detroit |date= 21 February 2010 }}</ref> but kept other restrictions.

To keep within the law, sometimes devices were used which rotated the models without them moving themselves. [[Fan dance]]s were another device used to keep performances within the law.

One means of collectivization pursued by strippers is the formation of labor unions, which involves formal membership.

The SAA successfully negotiated an [[industrial award]] with the [[Australian Industrial Relations Commission|AIRC]] in 2006. Despite this establishment of an industry-wide minimum standard for labor rights, changes to employment legislature under a Conservative government enabled employers to utilize loopholes such as employing strippers as sub-contractors.\n\nAnother group, the [[Scarlet Alliance]] has been involved in advocacy and projects geared towards improving the standing of sex workers since its inception in 1989.
