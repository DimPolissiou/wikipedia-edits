It replaces the two large immigration categories\u2014immigrant and nonimmigrant\u2014with the categories of \u201cvisitor\u201d and \u201ctemporary resident\u201d, while keeping the status of \u201cpermanent resident\u201d. In the General Law of Population the two categories incorporate over 30 different types of foreigners\u2014i.e. distinguished visitor, religious minister, etc.\u2014each with its own stipulations and requirements to qualify for entry and stay. Under the new law the requirements are simplified, basically differentiating those foreigners who are allowed to work and those who are not. The law also expedites the permanent resident application process for retirees and other foreigners. For granting permanent residency, the law proposes using a point system based on factors such as level of education, employment experience, and scientific and technological knowledge.<ref>Gonzalez-Murphy, Laura. \"Protecting Immigrant Rights in Mexico: Understanding the State-Civil Society Nexus,\"  Routledge, New York, Forthcoming 2013</ref>\n\nAccording to Article 81 of the Law and Article 70 of the regulations to the law\u2014published on 28 September 2012\u2014 immigration officials are the only ones that can conduct immigration procedures although the Federal Police may assist but only under the request and guidance of the Institute of Migration. Verification procedures cannot be conducted in migrant shelters run by civil society organizations or by individuals that engage in providing humanitarian assistance to immigrants.\n\nUndocumented immigration has been a problem for Mexico, especially since the 1970s.

It replaces the two large immigration categories\u2014immigrant and nonimmigrant\u2014with the categories of \u201cvisitor\u201d and \u201ctemporary resident\u201d, while keeping the status of \u201cpermanent resident\u201d. In the General Law of Population the two categories incorporate over 30 different types of foreigners\u2014i.e. distinguished visitor, religious minister, etc.\u2014each with its own stipulations and requirements to qualify for entry and stay. Under the new law the requirements are simplified, basically differentiating those foreigners who are allowed to work and those who are not. The law also expedites the permanent resident application process for retirees and other foreigners. For granting permanent residency, the law proposes using a point system based on factors such as level of education, employment experience, and scientific and technological knowledge.<ref>Gonzalez-Murphy, Laura. \"Protecting Immigrant Rights in Mexico: Understanding the State-Civil Society Nexus,\"  Routledge, New York, Forthcoming 2013</ref>\n\nAccording to Article 81 of the Law and Article 70 of the regulations to the law\u2014published on 28 September 2012\u2014 immigration officials are the only ones that can conduct immigration procedures although the Federal Police may assist but only under the request and guidance of the Institute of Migration. Verification procedures cannot be conducted in migrant shelters run by civil society organizations or by individuals that engage in providing humanitarian assistance to immigrants.\n\nUndocumented immigration has been a problem for Mexico, especially since the 1970s. Although the number of deportations is declining with 61,034 registered cases in 2011, the Mexican government documented over 200,000 unauthorized border crossings in 2004 and 2005.<ref>\"Estad\u00edsticas\"</ref> In 2011, 93% of undocumented immigrants in Mexico came from three countries -[[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]] and [[El Salvador]]- however, there is an increasing number of immigrants from [[Asia]] and [[Africa]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Indios, chinos, somal\u00edes\u2026 as\u00ed son los migrantes invisibles de M\u00e9xico|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mundo/noticias/2011/07/110722_mexico_migrantes_indios_chinos_irm.shtml|publisher=BBC Mundo|accessdate=30 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== History of immigration policy ===\n[[File:Inmigraci\u00f3n en M\u00e9xico 2015.png|thumb|400px|right|<center>Immigrants in [[M\u00e9xico]], census [[OCDE]] 2015.<ref>[http://www.oecd.org/document/51/0,3343,en_2649_33931_34063091_1_1_1_1,00.html Immigrants in Mexico, census OCDE 2000] OCDE</ref>]]\n\n[[File:Japanese immigrants in Sonora.jpg|thumbnail|[[Japanese immigration to Mexico|Japanese]] immigrant workers at the mine of [[Cananea]], Sonora in the 1910s.

Many, such as executives, professionals, scientists, artists, or athletes working for either Mexican or foreign companies, arrive with secure jobs. Retirement is the main motivation for immigrants who tend to be more permanent.

Retirees may live half a year in the U.S. to keep retiree benefits.  Those called \"snowbirds\" come in fall and leave in spring.

She was known for her beautiful singing voice, which earned her the nickname ''Taghr\u012bd'' (\"Twitter\").{{sfn|Halm|2015|p=99}} She died in 995.{{sfn|Halm|2015|p=100}}\n\nIn 974 his older brother [[Abdallah ibn al-Mu'izz|Abdallah]]\u2014who had been the designated heir in preference to the oldest of al-Mu'izz's sons, Tamim\u2014died, and Nazir found himself as his father's designated successor (''wal\u012b al-\u02bfahd'').{{sfn|Daftary|2007|pp=172\u2013173}} The succession was not confirmed in front of the members of the dynasty and court, however, until a day before al-Mu'izz's death on 18 December 975.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=823}} His official proclamation as caliph was delayed until 9 August 976.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=823}}\n\n=== Administration and economy ===\nAccording to the sources, al-Aziz Billah was \"tall, with red hair and blue eyes, generous, brave, fond of horses and hunting and very humane and tolerant in disposition\".{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=823}} He was marked for his skill as an administrator, reforming the finances of the Fatimid state, standardizing and streamlining the payment of officials, and taking steps to ensure their integrity.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=823}} At the same time, he was known for his extravagant lifestyle and obsession for precious objects and materials, rare animals and delicacies; it is said that on one occasion, he had [[carrier pigeons]] bring him cherries from [[Ba'albek]].{{sfn|Canard|1960|pp=823\u2013824}} The Egyptian economy was also nurtured, and tax revenue thereby increased, through the expansion of streets and canals and the establishment of a stable currency. The general economic well-being was also apparent in an elaborate building programme.\n\nThe most influential official during most of his reign was [[Ya'qub ibn Killis]], who was the first in Fatimid history to be designated as \"[[vizier]]\", in 979. Apart from two brief periods when Ibn Killis fell into disgrace\u2014in 979 and 984\u2014he remained al-Aziz's chief minister until his death in 991.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=823}} Just like his master, Ibn Killis lived in great luxury, facilitated by a salary of 100,000 [[gold dinar]]s.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}} Ibn Killis is credited with the capable administration of the public finances, which ensured a full treasury despite the vast sums expended by the luxury-loving Caliph,{{sfn|Canard|1960|pp=823, 824}} but also for his role as a patron of men of letters, and the author of a book that codified Fatimid laws.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=823}} In contrast, his successors did not long remain in office, and in the short space of five years, the post of vizier was occupied by six men: [[Ali ibn Umar al-Addas]], [[Abu'l-Fadl Ja'far ibn al-Furat]], [[al-Husayn ibn al-Hasan al-Baziyar]], [[Abu Muhammad ibn Ammar]], [[al-Fadl ibn Salih (Fatimid vizier)|al-Fadl ibn Salih]], and [[Isa ibn Nesturus]].{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=823}}\n\n=== Military reforms ===\nAl-Aziz also undertook major military reforms. [[Berbers]], and especially the [[Kutama]] tribe, had traditionally provided the mainstay of the Fatimid armies, and had played the main role in the takeover of [[Ifriqiya]] and the conquest of Egypt and the southern [[Levant]] under al-Aziz's predecessors.{{sfn|Lev|1987|pp=344, 345}} Until the 970s, the Kutama provided the cavalry, with the infantry composed of [[Slavs|Slavic]] (''[[Saqaliba|\u1e62aq\u0101liba]]''), [[Byzantine Greeks|Greek]] (''[[R\u016bm]]'') and Black African (''S\u016bd\u0101n'' or ''\u02bfab\u012bd'') slaves.{{sfn|Lev|1987|pp=338\u2013340}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=324}}\n\nHowever, the forays into the Levant revealed the inadequacies of an army based solely on the Kutama, and from 978, al-Aziz, began to introduce mercenaries from the Islamic East, especially [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] and [[Daylamites]]. The adoption of the ''[[ghilman|ghilm\u0101n]]'' system had far-reaching repercussions, as the Turkish ''ghilm\u0101n'' assumed senior positions in the state and began to rival the Kutama for influence, especially as the flow of new recruits from the Kutama homeland ebbed after {{circa|987/88}}.{{sfn|Lev|1987|pp=344, 345\u2013346}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=322, 324}} Consequently, a fierce antagonism developed between the two groups, termed ''Magh\u0101riba'' (\"Westerners\") and ''Mash\u0101riqa'' (\"Easterners\") respectively, which would erupt in open warfare after al-Aziz's death.{{sfn|Lev|1987|pp=344\u2013346}}{{sfn|Daftary|2007|pp=178\u2013179}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=327\u2013328}}\n\n=== Religious policies ===\nThe employment of the Christian Ibn Nesturus, just as that of the Jew Manashsha as Secretary for [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]], was a prominent example of the Fatimids' tolerance in religious matters, further encouraged under al-Aziz by his [[Melkite]] Christian wife. Two of her brothers, [[Orestes of Jerusalem|Orestes]] and Arsenius, were appointed as [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch of Jerusalem]] and [[metropolitan bishop]] of [[Cairo]], respectively.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=823}} The [[Copts|Coptic]] Christians also benefited from the Caliph's favour, allowing them to rebuilt the [[Saint Mercurius Church in Coptic Cairo|Saint Mercurius Church]] despite Muslim opposition, or refusing to punish a Muslim man who converted to Christianity.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=823}} This leniency, crowned by the appointment to high office of Ibn Nesturus and Manashsha, was resented by the Muslim populace, with Muslim opinion incensed by hostile tracts circulating among them. The Caliph was briefly forced to depose his two ministers and imprison them, but soon their undoubted skill ensured their release and reinstatement.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=823}} Anti-Christian animus was most evident in 996, when merchants from [[Amalfi]] were suspected of being responsible for a fire that destroyed the arsenal at Cairo; in a city-wide anti-Christian pogrom, the Amalfitans were murdered and churches were ransacked.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=823}}\n\nThis tolerance did not extend towards the [[Sunni Muslim]] population, however, as al-Aziz followed a fervently [[Isma'ili]] agenda: he erected inscriptions denouncing the [[Companions of the Prophet]], abolished the [[Tarawih]] prayers in 982, and initiated the celebration of the [[Ashura]] festival in Cairo. In 991, a man found in possession of the Sunni legal treatise ''[[Muwatta Imam Malik]]'' was executed.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=823}}\n\nThe reign of Al-Aziz was also culturally significant. Ibn Killis founded the [[al-Azhar University]] in [[Cairo]] (988) which went on to become the most important centre of learning in the [[Islamic world]]. Likewise a library with 200,000 volumes was built in Cairo.\n\nAccording to Professor Samy S. Swayd [[Fatimid]] missionaries made their [[Dawah]] in China during the reign of Al-Aziz.<ref>{{cite book |title=Historical dictionary of the Druzes|author=Samy S.

The Fatimids used the Byzantine advance as a major item in their propaganda, claiming to be the only power capable of championing the ''[[jihad]]'' against the \"[[infidel]]\" threat.{{sfn|Brett|2001|pp=295\u2013308}} However, Fatimid policy with regard to Syria during the early part of al-Aziz's reign was dominated by the vizier Ibn Killis, who, according to historian [[Hugh N. Kennedy]], \"believed that the Fatimids should concentrate on controlling Palestine and southern Syria, while leaving the north of the Hamdanids and their successors to form a buffer state against the Byzantines, with whom the caliph should try to keep on good terms\".{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=321}}\n\nDespite initial successes, the initial Fatimid invasion of Syria, under the Kutama general [[Ja'far ibn Fallah]], quickly came to a halt through a combination of rebellions by the citizens of [[Damascus]] and the [[Bedouin]] tribes of the [[Syrian Desert]].{{sfn|Brett|2001|pp=312\u2013313}}{{sfn|Gil|1997|pp=336\u2013338}} In August 971, the Fatimids were defeated in battle against the Bedouin and their [[Qarmatian]] allies, leading to the near total collapse of Fatimid control in southern Syria and Palestine, and even a short-lived Qarmatian invasion of Egypt.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=318}}{{sfn|Brett|2001|pp=313\u2013315}}{{sfn|Gil|1997|pp=339ff.}}\n\nWhen al-Aziz came to power, Damascus was ruled by the Turk [[Alptakin]], who with only 300 of his fellow Turks had taken power by exploiting the unpopularity of the Fatimids' Kutama troops, gained popular support by restoring order in the city, and held it against the Fatimids, recognizing Abbasid suzerainty.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=321}} Further south, Palestine was under Fatimid control, but the powerful Bedouin chieftain of the [[Banu Tayy]] tribe, [[Mufarrij ibn Daghfal ibn al-Jarrah]], was opposed to them and held the provincial capital [[Ramla]].{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}}\n\n==== Reconquest of Damascus ====\n{{quote box\n| width     = 260px\n| align     = right\n| bgcolor   = #c6dbf7\n| quote     = \"O [[Commander of the Faithful]], maintain peace with the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] as long as they maintain peace with you.

Ahmad al-Nablusi'' and his followers.<ref>Wilson, John Francis. (2004) ibid p 122</ref>\n\nIn 976, the Fatimid general [[Jawhar (general)|Jawhar]], the conqueror of Egypt, campaigned against Damascus, but after two months of clashes before the city he had to retreat due to the arrival of Alptakin's Qarmatian allies.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}} Followed by Alptakin's forces, Jawhar was pushed back to [[Tiberias]], Ramla and finally [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]], where he was besieged.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}} The siege lasted for seventeen months and ended in early 978 with a negotiated agreement, which abandoned the entire territory from Ascalon to Damascus to Alptakin. Only [[Gaza City|Gaza]] remained under direct Fatimid control, although Alptakin was prepared to acknowledge the nominal suzerainty of al-Aziz over the territories he ruled. Jawhar and his men had also to undergo the humiliation of passing under a sword and lance in token of their defeat while departing Ascalon for Egypt.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=321\u2013322}}\n\nThe Fatimid court could not accept this humiliating agreement, which not only left Egypt vulnerable to attack, but also deprived senior members of the Fatimid elite\u2014including Ibn Killis himself\u2014of important properties around Damascus.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=322}} As a result, al-Aziz took the field in person and, at the head of an enormous army, defeated and captured Alptakin in August 978.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=322}} The Qarmatians were bribed with promises of an annual payment of tribute to retreat to [[Bahrayn (historical region)|Bahrayn]], thus bringing an end to their incursions into Syria.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=322}} The events of the previous years also demonstrated to Ibn Killis the dangers of continuing to rely on the Kutama. As a result, the Caliph unexpectedly showed clemency to Alptakin, taking him and his Turkish followers into Fatimid service.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=322}} Alptakin himself was taken to Cairo, where he was lavishly honoured by the Caliph, arousing the envy of Ibn Killis, who had Alptakin poisoned.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}} Nevertheless, as noted before, this event was of momentous importance and marked a major departure from previous Fatimid practice; especially in Syria, the Turkish ''ghilm\u0101n'' remained influential and often occupied the position of governor of Damascus.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=322, 324}}\n\nDamascus itself was taken over by one of Alptakin's lieutenants, Qassam, with the support of the local population and the city militia (''[[Ahdath|a\u1e25d\u0101th]]''), who wished to avoid a renewed Berber occupation.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=322}} The Fatimid general al-Fadl ibn Salih, a [[prot\u00e9g\u00e9]] of Ibn Killis, was sent with a Berber army against Qassam, but other than a show of force against the coastal cities failed to achieve anything and retreated to Palestine.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=323}} Matters became complicated with the arrival of [[Abu Taghlib]], the ousted Hamdanid ruler of Mosul, who contacted al-Aziz with an offer to capture the city if they supported him with troops. This was opposed by Ibn al-Jarrah, who feared lest the Hamdanid and his followers form the [[Banu Uqayl]] tribe, rivals to the Tayy, threaten his own position, particularly his possession of Ramla and the pasture lands of his tribe. Al-Fadl apparently played a duplicitous game, encouraging Abu Taghlib in his designs on Ramla in an effort to sow dissension among the Arab tribes and strengthen Fatimid authority; however, in August 979, when Ibn al-Jarrah attacked Abu Taghlib and his men at Ramla, al-Fadl came to his aid with his own troops. Abu Taghlib was taken captive and executed.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=322\u2013323}}{{sfn|Gil|1997|pp=354\u2013356}} This battle established Ibn al-Jarrah and his Tayy as a major player in the region's power politics: despite his recognition of Fatimid suzerainty, the Tayy chieftain was a virtually independent ruler and remained a constant nuisance for the Fatimid government for decades.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=323}}\n\n[[File:Fragment of a Bowl Depicting a Mounted Warrior, 11th century. 86.227.83.jpg|thumb|250px|Bowl fragment with a mounted warrior, 11th century]]\nDamascus continued to resist Fatimid attempts to capture it, notably under the Kutama chieftain [[Sulayman ibn Ja'far ibn Fallah]] in 979/80,{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=323}} while, despite al-Fadl's efforts to use the Uqayl to contain them, the Tayy and their unchecked depradations grew to be a menace to the settled and agrigultural districts of southern Syria: Ramla was \"reduced to a ghost town\", in the words of Kennedy, and the [[Ghuta]] plain around Damascus and the [[Hawran]] region were so devastated that Damascus faced famine, alleviated only through supplies sent from [[Homs]], ruled by the Turk [[Bakjur]] for the Hamdanids of Aleppo.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=323}} As a result of the successive failures of Berber commanders to capture Damascus and restore order in the province, the Fatimid court appointed a Turk, [[Baltakin]], a former follower of Alptakin, as commander of the next expedition into Syria. Baltakin defeated Ibn al-Jarrah, who fled north to Antioch and the protection of the Byzantines, while Qassam was finally forced to surrender Damascus in early 983, albeit under generous terms that allowed him to remain in control under a Fatimid-appointed governor.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=323}}\n\n==== Contest for Aleppo ====\nAfter securing Fatimid rule in central and southern Syria, Caliph al-Aziz aimed to capture Aleppo as well, but was restrained by Ibn Killis while he lived.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}} The question of Aleppo was complicated, as it risked provoking a direct confrontation with Byzantium.{{sfn|Lev|1995|p=201}} Since 969, the Hamdanid emirate had been [[tributary state|tributary]] to the Byzantines. Its ruler, [[Sa'd al-Dawla]] ({{reign|967|991}}), resented this dependence, but was forced to abide with it in order to prevent an outright Fatimid conquest. As a result, his policy vacillated between the two powers.{{sfn|Stevenson|1926|p=250}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=280\u2013281}} Nevertheless, the Fatimids benefited from the weakness of the Hamdanids, as many Hamdanid supporters began entering Fatimid service. For example, [[Raja al-Siqlabi]] defected with 300 of his men, and was appointed governor of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] and [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]].{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=324}}\n\nThe most important such defection was that of the Hamdanid governor of Homs, Bakjur, in 983. Bakjur contacted al-Aziz directly and offered to enter Fatimid service against Aleppo in exchange for the governorship of Damascus.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=324}} Attracted by the possibility of taking over not only Homs but possibly Aleppo as well, al-Aziz agreed to Bakjur's offer over the vehement opposition of Ibn Killis, who was briefly deposed and imprisoned in conjunction with a harvest failure that led to famine in the capital.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=324}} The Caliph provided Bakjur with an army, with which he attacked Aleppo in September. Sa'd al-Dawla was forced to appeal to the Byzantine emperor [[Basil II]] ({{reign|976|1025}}) for help, who sent his general [[Bardas Phokas the Younger]] to assist Aleppo. Forewarned of the Byzantines' approach by the exiled Ibn al-Jarrah, Bakjur raised the siege and fled to Fatimid territory. The Byzantines proceeded to sack Homs in October, and returned the city to Hamdanid control.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}}{{sfn|Stevenson|1926|pp=249, 250}} In 987/8, a seven-year truce was concluded with the Byzantines. It stipulated an [[Arab\u2013Byzantine prisoner exchanges|exchange of prisoners]], the recognition of the Byzantine emperor as protector of Christians under Fatimid rule and of the Fatimid Caliph as protector of Muslims under Byzantine control, and the replacement of the name of the Abbasid caliph with that of the Fatimid caliph in the [[Friday prayer]] in the mosque at [[Constantinople]].{{sfn|Lev|1995|p=202}}\n\nDespite his failure, Bakjur was named governor of Damascus by al-Aziz, and was joined by Ibn al-Jarrah. Ibn Killis, who was released and restored to his office after barely two months, immediately began working against the two. Bakjur gradually made himself unpopular to the Damascenes due to his cruelty, and after several failed efforts, in 989 Ibn Killis finally persuaded al-Aziz to replace Bakjur with one of the vizier's personal ''ghilm\u0101n'', [[Ya'qub al-Siqlabi]]. Bakjur fled to [[Raqqa]], from where he continued his unsuccessful attacks on Aleppo.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=324}} At the same time, Baltakin was sent to pacify the Bedouin tribes who were raiding the [[Hajj]] caravans, leading to the establishment of a Fatimid garrison at [[Wadi al-Qura]], north of [[Medina]].{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=324}}\n\nIbn Killis' death in 991 freed al-Aziz to pursue a more aggressive stance in the Aleppo question. Immediately he dismissed Ibn Killis' prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and appointed the Turk [[Manjutakin]] as governor of Damascus.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=324\u2013325}} Manjutakin's use of Damascus as his base during the subsequent campaigns shows the consolidation of Fatimid control in the area, but also, as Hugh Kennedy remarks, the changes it brought to the \"political and economic geography of Syria\": given the continued insecurity of the overland routes due to the depredations of the Bedouin, the Fatimids supplied their forces in Syria by sea\u2014notably via [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]]\u2014and as a result the chief coastal towns rose in importance, as centres of Fatimid control and administration as well as commerce, experiencing a revival which continued into the 12th century.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=325\u2013326}}\n\nManjutakin invaded the Hamdanid emirate, defeated a Byzantine force under the ''[[dux|doux]]'' of [[Antioch]], [[Michael Bourtzes]], in June 992, and laid siege to Aleppo. However, he failed to pursue the siege with vigour and the city was easily able to resist until, in the spring of 993, after thirteen months of campaigning, Manjutakin was forced to return to Damascus due to lack of supplies.{{sfn|Stevenson|1926|p=251}} In spring 994, Manjutakin launched another invasion, again defeated Bourtzes at the [[Battle of the Orontes]] in September and [[Siege of Aleppo (994\u2013995)|again besieged]] Aleppo. The blockade was far more effective this time and soon caused a severe lack of food, but the city's defenders held out until the sudden arrival of the Byzantine emperor, [[Basil II]], in person in April 995.{{sfn|Stevenson|1926|p=251}} Basil crossed [[Asia Minor]] in only sixteen days at the head of an army; his sudden arrival, and the exaggerated numbers circulating for his army, caused panic in the Fatimid army. Manjutakin burned his camp and retreated to Damascus without giving battle.{{sfn|Stevenson|1926|p=251}}\n\nThe Byzantines besieged [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] but failed to capture it; nevertheless, the Fatimids lost control of the city, which became independent under its ''[[qadi]]''.{{sfn|Lev|1995|p=202}} The Byzantine emperor then occupied and fortified [[Tartus]].{{sfn|Lev|1995|p=202}} Al-Aziz himself now prepared to take the field against the Byzantines himself, beginning large-scale preparations at Cairo.{{sfn|Lev|1995|p=203}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=325, 327}} Byzantine and Hamdanid embassies carrying proposals for a truce were received in September 995, but rejected.{{sfn|Lev|1995|p=203}} Al-Aziz's preparations were set back when the fleet being prepared at Cairo was destroyed by a fire, which set off an anti-Christian pogrom in the city.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=325}} Manjutakin was ordered to recapture Tartus, but its Armenian garrison was able to fend off his attacks; and a Fatimid fleet sent to assist the siege was lost in a storm off the coast.{{sfn|Lev|1995|p=202}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=325}} Al-Aziz died on 14 October 996, before setting out on his campaign.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=327}} The Byzantine\u2013Fatimid conflict continued under his successor until the conclusion of a ten-year truce in 1000.{{sfn|Lev|1995|pp=203\u2013205}}\n\n=== Arabia and North Africa ===\nAlong with Syria, al-Aziz presided over an expansion of Fatimid influence in the [[Arabian peninsula]]. The Hajj\u2014at least those caravans setting off from Cairo with the pilgrims of the western Islamic world\u2014was placed under Fatimid control and protection, despite the considerable cost.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=326}} The [[emirs of Mecca]], although ''de facto'' autonomous, recognized the Fatimids' suzerainty, in token of which the Fatimids enjoyed the prestigious privilege of furnishing each year the new cover of the [[Kaaba]] (the ''[[kiswa]]'').{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=326}} Finally, in 992 the Fatimids were acknowledged as caliphs in the [[Islamic history of Yemen|Yemen]],{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=326}} and even their old enemies, the Qarmatians of Bahrayn, came around to acknowledge their claims.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=326}} According to Kennedy, these diplomatic victories were the result of the more energetic foreign policy pursued by al-Aziz, particularly after the death of Ibn Killis, which bolstered his credentials by demonstrating \"his ability and willingness to undertake the two major public responsibilities of a caliph, to safeguard the Hajj and to lead the Muslims against the infidel Byzantines\".{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=326}}\n\nOn the other hand, [[North Africa]], including the former Fatimid heartland of Ifriqiya, was mostly neglected.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}} Effective power there had passed to the [[Zirid]] viceroy of Ifriqiya, [[Buluggin ibn Ziri]] ({{reign|972|984}}), who was confirmed in office by al-Aziz, as was his son [[al-Mansur ibn Buluggin|al-Mansur]] ({{reign|984|996}}).{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}} In 992, al-Aziz even confirmed al-Mansur's son [[Badis ibn Mansur|Badis]] as heir-apparent, thereby strengthening the Zirids' claim to dynastic succession.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=326}} Indeed, as Kennedy remarks, \"nothing is more striking than the speed with which [the Fatimids] were prepared to allow North Africa to go its own way\";{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=326}} apart from diplomatic exchanges of gifts,{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=326}} the Zirids governed their domains increasingly independently from the Fatimid court, even to the point of warring with the Kutama, the erstwhile mainstay of the Fatimid regime.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}} In a similar manner, al-Aziz contended himself with recognizing the succession of the [[Kalbid]] emirs of [[Emirate of Sicily|Sicily]] after the event.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}} Nearer to Egypt, the governor of Barqa ([[Cyrenaica]]) is known to have brought presents to the court of Cairo, but otherwise there are no indications of the Fatimids' exercising any control over him.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=326}}\n\nAl-Aziz died on 13 October 996.

She was known for her beautiful singing voice, which earned her the nickname ''Taghr\u012bd'' (\"Twitter\").{{sfn|Halm|2015|p=99}} She died in 995.{{sfn|Halm|2015|p=100}}\n\nIn 974 his older brother [[Abdallah ibn al-Mu'izz|Abdallah]]\u2014who had been the designated heir in preference to the oldest of al-Mu'izz's sons, Tamim\u2014died, and Nazir found himself as his father's designated successor (''wal\u012b al-\u02bfahd'').{{sfn|Daftary|2007|pp=172\u2013173}} The succession was not confirmed in front of the members of the dynasty and court, however, until a day before al-Mu'izz's death on 18 December 975.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=823}} His official proclamation as caliph was delayed until 9 August 976.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=823}}\n\n=== Administration and economy ===\nAccording to the sources, al-Aziz Billah was \"tall, with red hair and blue eyes, generous, brave, fond of horses and hunting and very humane and tolerant in disposition\".{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=823}} He was marked for his skill as an administrator, reforming the finances of the Fatimid state, standardizing and streamlining the payment of officials, and taking steps to ensure their integrity.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=823}} At the same time, he was known for his extravagant lifestyle and obsession for precious objects and materials, rare animals and delicacies; it is said that on one occasion, he had [[carrier pigeons]] bring him cherries from [[Ba'albek]].{{sfn|Canard|1960|pp=823\u2013824}} The Egyptian economy was also nurtured, and tax revenue thereby increased, through the expansion of streets and canals and the establishment of a stable currency. The general economic well-being was also apparent in an elaborate building programme.\n\nThe most influential official during most of his reign was [[Ya'qub ibn Killis]], who was the first in Fatimid history to be designated as \"[[vizier]]\", in 979. Apart from two brief periods when Ibn Killis fell into disgrace\u2014in 979 and 984\u2014he remained al-Aziz's chief minister until his death in 991.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=823}} Just like his master, Ibn Killis lived in great luxury, facilitated by a salary of 100,000 [[gold dinar]]s.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}} Ibn Killis is credited with the capable administration of the public finances, which ensured a full treasury despite the vast sums expended by the luxury-loving Caliph,{{sfn|Canard|1960|pp=823, 824}} but also for his role as a patron of men of letters, and the author of a book that codified Fatimid laws.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=823}} In contrast, his successors did not long remain in office, and in the short space of five years, the post of vizier was occupied by six men: [[Ali ibn Umar al-Addas]], [[Abu'l-Fadl Ja'far ibn al-Furat]], [[al-Husayn ibn al-Hasan al-Baziyar]], [[Abu Muhammad ibn Ammar]], [[al-Fadl ibn Salih (Fatimid vizier)|al-Fadl ibn Salih]], and [[Isa ibn Nesturus]].{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=823}}\n\n=== Military reforms ===\nAl-Aziz also undertook major military reforms. [[Berbers]], and especially the [[Kutama]] tribe, had traditionally provided the mainstay of the Fatimid armies, and had played the main role in the takeover of [[Ifriqiya]] and the conquest of Egypt and the southern [[Levant]] under al-Aziz's predecessors.{{sfn|Lev|1987|pp=344, 345}} Until the 970s, the Kutama provided the cavalry, with the infantry composed of [[Slavs|Slavic]] (''[[Saqaliba|\u1e62aq\u0101liba]]''), [[Byzantine Greeks|Greek]] (''[[R\u016bm]]'') and Black African (''S\u016bd\u0101n'' or ''\u02bfab\u012bd'') slaves.{{sfn|Lev|1987|pp=338\u2013340}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=324}}\n\nHowever, the forays into the Levant revealed the inadequacies of an army based solely on the Kutama, and from 978, al-Aziz, began to introduce mercenaries from the Islamic East, especially [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] and [[Daylamites]]. The adoption of the ''[[ghilman|ghilm\u0101n]]'' system had far-reaching repercussions, as the Turkish ''ghilm\u0101n'' assumed senior positions in the state and began to rival the Kutama for influence, especially as the flow of new recruits from the Kutama homeland ebbed after {{circa|987/88}}.{{sfn|Lev|1987|pp=344, 345\u2013346}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=322, 324}} Consequently, a fierce antagonism developed between the two groups, termed ''Magh\u0101riba'' (\"Westerners\") and ''Mash\u0101riqa'' (\"Easterners\") respectively, which would erupt in open warfare after al-Aziz's death.{{sfn|Lev|1987|pp=344\u2013346}}{{sfn|Daftary|2007|pp=178\u2013179}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=327\u2013328}}\n\n=== Religious policies ===\nThe employment of the Christian Ibn Nesturus, just as that of the Jew Manashsha as Secretary for [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]], was a prominent example of the Fatimids' tolerance in religious matters, further encouraged under al-Aziz by his [[Melkite]] Christian wife. Two of her brothers, [[Orestes of Jerusalem|Orestes]] and Arsenius, were appointed as [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch of Jerusalem]] and [[metropolitan bishop]] of [[Cairo]], respectively.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=823}} The [[Copts|Coptic]] Christians also benefited from the Caliph's favour, allowing them to rebuilt the [[Saint Mercurius Church in Coptic Cairo|Saint Mercurius Church]] despite Muslim opposition, or refusing to punish a Muslim man who converted to Christianity.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=823}} This leniency, crowned by the appointment to high office of Ibn Nesturus and Manashsha, was resented by the Muslim populace, with Muslim opinion incensed by hostile tracts circulating among them. The Caliph was briefly forced to depose his two ministers and imprison them, but soon their undoubted skill ensured their release and reinstatement.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=823}} Anti-Christian animus was most evident in 996, when merchants from [[Amalfi]] were suspected of being responsible for a fire that destroyed the arsenal at Cairo; in a city-wide anti-Christian pogrom, the Amalfitans were murdered and churches were ransacked.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=823}}\n\nThis tolerance did not extend towards the [[Sunni Muslim]] population, however, as al-Aziz followed a fervently [[Isma'ili]] agenda: he erected inscriptions denouncing the [[Companions of the Prophet]], abolished the [[Tarawih]] prayers in 982, and initiated the celebration of the [[Ashura]] festival in Cairo. In 991, a man found in possession of the Sunni legal treatise ''[[Muwatta Imam Malik]]'' was executed.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=823}}\n\nThe reign of Al-Aziz was also culturally significant. Ibn Killis founded the [[al-Azhar University]] in [[Cairo]] (988) which went on to become the most important centre of learning in the [[Islamic world]]. Likewise a library with 200,000 volumes was built in Cairo.\n\nAccording to Professor Samy S. Swayd [[Fatimid]] missionaries made their [[Dawah]] in China during the reign of Al-Aziz.<ref>{{cite book |title=Historical dictionary of the Druzes|author=Samy S.

The Fatimids used the Byzantine advance as a major item in their propaganda, claiming to be the only power capable of championing the ''[[jihad]]'' against the \"[[infidel]]\" threat.{{sfn|Brett|2001|pp=295\u2013308}} However, Fatimid policy with regard to Syria during the early part of al-Aziz's reign was dominated by the vizier Ibn Killis, who, according to historian [[Hugh N. Kennedy]], \"believed that the Fatimids should concentrate on controlling Palestine and southern Syria, while leaving the north of the Hamdanids and their successors to form a buffer state against the Byzantines, with whom the caliph should try to keep on good terms\".{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=321}}\n\nDespite initial successes, the initial Fatimid invasion of Syria, under the Kutama general [[Ja'far ibn Fallah]], quickly came to a halt through a combination of rebellions by the citizens of [[Damascus]] and the [[Bedouin]] tribes of the [[Syrian Desert]].{{sfn|Brett|2001|pp=312\u2013313}}{{sfn|Gil|1997|pp=336\u2013338}} In August 971, the Fatimids were defeated in battle against the Bedouin and their [[Qarmatian]] allies, leading to the near total collapse of Fatimid control in southern Syria and Palestine, and even a short-lived Qarmatian invasion of Egypt.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=318}}{{sfn|Brett|2001|pp=313\u2013315}}{{sfn|Gil|1997|pp=339ff.}}\n\nWhen al-Aziz came to power, Damascus was ruled by the Turk [[Alptakin]], who with only 300 of his fellow Turks had taken power by exploiting the unpopularity of the Fatimids' Kutama troops, gained popular support by restoring order in the city, and held it against the Fatimids, recognizing Abbasid suzerainty.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=321}} Further south, Palestine was under Fatimid control, but the powerful Bedouin chieftain of the [[Banu Tayy]] tribe, [[Mufarrij ibn Daghfal ibn al-Jarrah]], was opposed to them and held the provincial capital [[Ramla]].{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}}\n\n==== Reconquest of Damascus ====\n{{quote box\n| width     = 260px\n| align     = right\n| bgcolor   = #c6dbf7\n| quote     = \"O [[Commander of the Faithful]], maintain peace with the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] as long as they maintain peace with you.

Ahmad al-Nablusi'' and his followers.<ref>Wilson, John Francis. (2004) ibid p 122</ref>\n\nIn 976, the Fatimid general [[Jawhar (general)|Jawhar]], the conqueror of Egypt, campaigned against Damascus, but after two months of clashes before the city he had to retreat due to the arrival of Alptakin's Qarmatian allies.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}} Followed by Alptakin's forces, Jawhar was pushed back to [[Tiberias]], Ramla and finally [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]], where he was besieged.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}} The siege lasted for seventeen months and ended in early 978 with a negotiated agreement, which abandoned the entire territory from Ascalon to Damascus to Alptakin. Only [[Gaza City|Gaza]] remained under direct Fatimid control, although Alptakin was prepared to acknowledge the nominal suzerainty of al-Aziz over the territories he ruled. Jawhar and his men had also to undergo the humiliation of passing under a sword and lance in token of their defeat while departing Ascalon for Egypt.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=321\u2013322}}\n\nThe Fatimid court could not accept this humiliating agreement, which not only left Egypt vulnerable to attack, but also deprived senior members of the Fatimid elite\u2014including Ibn Killis himself\u2014of important properties around Damascus.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=322}} As a result, al-Aziz took the field in person and, at the head of an enormous army, defeated and captured Alptakin in August 978.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=322}} The Qarmatians were bribed with promises of an annual payment of tribute to retreat to [[Bahrayn (historical region)|Bahrayn]], thus bringing an end to their incursions into Syria.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=322}} The events of the previous years also demonstrated to Ibn Killis the dangers of continuing to rely on the Kutama. As a result, the Caliph unexpectedly showed clemency to Alptakin, taking him and his Turkish followers into Fatimid service.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=322}} Alptakin himself was taken to Cairo, where he was lavishly honoured by the Caliph, arousing the envy of Ibn Killis, who had Alptakin poisoned.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}} Nevertheless, as noted before, this event was of momentous importance and marked a major departure from previous Fatimid practice; especially in Syria, the Turkish ''ghilm\u0101n'' remained influential and often occupied the position of governor of Damascus.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=322, 324}}\n\nDamascus itself was taken over by one of Alptakin's lieutenants, Qassam, with the support of the local population and the city militia (''[[Ahdath|a\u1e25d\u0101th]]''), who wished to avoid a renewed Berber occupation.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=322}} The Fatimid general al-Fadl ibn Salih, a [[prot\u00e9g\u00e9]] of Ibn Killis, was sent with a Berber army against Qassam, but other than a show of force against the coastal cities failed to achieve anything and retreated to Palestine.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=323}} Matters became complicated with the arrival of [[Abu Taghlib]], the ousted Hamdanid ruler of Mosul, who contacted al-Aziz with an offer to capture the city if they supported him with troops. This was opposed by Ibn al-Jarrah, who feared lest the Hamdanid and his followers form the [[Banu Uqayl]] tribe, rivals to the Tayy, threaten his own position, particularly his possession of Ramla and the pasture lands of his tribe. Al-Fadl apparently played a duplicitous game, encouraging Abu Taghlib in his designs on Ramla in an effort to sow dissension among the Arab tribes and strengthen Fatimid authority; however, in August 979, when Ibn al-Jarrah attacked Abu Taghlib and his men at Ramla, al-Fadl came to his aid with his own troops. Abu Taghlib was taken captive and executed.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=322\u2013323}}{{sfn|Gil|1997|pp=354\u2013356}} This battle established Ibn al-Jarrah and his Tayy as a major player in the region's power politics: despite his recognition of Fatimid suzerainty, the Tayy chieftain was a virtually independent ruler and remained a constant nuisance for the Fatimid government for decades.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=323}}\n\n[[File:Fragment of a Bowl Depicting a Mounted Warrior, 11th century. 86.227.83.jpg|thumb|250px|Bowl fragment with a mounted warrior, 11th century]]\nDamascus continued to resist Fatimid attempts to capture it, notably under the Kutama chieftain [[Sulayman ibn Ja'far ibn Fallah]] in 979/80,{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=323}} while, despite al-Fadl's efforts to use the Uqayl to contain them, the Tayy and their unchecked depradations grew to be a menace to the settled and agrigultural districts of southern Syria: Ramla was \"reduced to a ghost town\", in the words of Kennedy, and the [[Ghuta]] plain around Damascus and the [[Hawran]] region were so devastated that Damascus faced famine, alleviated only through supplies sent from [[Homs]], ruled by the Turk [[Bakjur]] for the Hamdanids of Aleppo.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=323}} As a result of the successive failures of Berber commanders to capture Damascus and restore order in the province, the Fatimid court appointed a Turk, [[Baltakin]], a former follower of Alptakin, as commander of the next expedition into Syria. Baltakin defeated Ibn al-Jarrah, who fled north to Antioch and the protection of the Byzantines, while Qassam was finally forced to surrender Damascus in early 983, albeit under generous terms that allowed him to remain in control under a Fatimid-appointed governor.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=323}}\n\n==== Contest for Aleppo ====\nAfter securing Fatimid rule in central and southern Syria, Caliph al-Aziz aimed to capture Aleppo as well, but was restrained by Ibn Killis while he lived.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}} The question of Aleppo was complicated, as it risked provoking a direct confrontation with Byzantium.{{sfn|Lev|1995|p=201}} Since 969, the Hamdanid emirate had been [[tributary state|tributary]] to the Byzantines. Its ruler, [[Sa'd al-Dawla]] ({{reign|967|991}}), resented this dependence, but was forced to abide with it in order to prevent an outright Fatimid conquest. As a result, his policy vacillated between the two powers.{{sfn|Stevenson|1926|p=250}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=280\u2013281}} Nevertheless, the Fatimids benefited from the weakness of the Hamdanids, as many Hamdanid supporters began entering Fatimid service. For example, [[Raja al-Siqlabi]] defected with 300 of his men, and was appointed governor of [[Acre]] and [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]].{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=324}}\n\nThe most important such defection was that of the Hamdanid governor of Homs, Bakjur, in 983. Bakjur contacted al-Aziz directly and offered to enter Fatimid service against Aleppo in exchange for the governorship of Damascus.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=324}} Attracted by the possibility of taking over not only Homs but possibly Aleppo as well, al-Aziz agreed to Bakjur's offer over the vehement opposition of Ibn Killis, who was briefly deposed and imprisoned in conjunction with a harvest failure that led to famine in the capital.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=324}} The Caliph provided Bakjur with an army, with which he attacked Aleppo in September. Sa'd al-Dawla was forced to appeal to the Byzantine emperor [[Basil II]] ({{reign|976|1025}}) for help, who sent his general [[Bardas Phokas the Younger]] to assist Aleppo. Forewarned of the Byzantines' approach by the exiled Ibn al-Jarrah, Bakjur raised the siege and fled to Fatimid territory. The Byzantines proceeded to sack Homs in October, and returned the city to Hamdanid control.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}}{{sfn|Stevenson|1926|pp=249, 250}} In 987/8, a seven-year truce was concluded with the Byzantines. It stipulated an [[Arab\u2013Byzantine prisoner exchanges|exchange of prisoners]], the recognition of the Byzantine emperor as protector of Christians under Fatimid rule and of the Fatimid Caliph as protector of Muslims under Byzantine control, and the replacement of the name of the Abbasid caliph with that of the Fatimid caliph in the [[Friday prayer]] in the mosque at [[Constantinople]].{{sfn|Lev|1995|p=202}}\n\nDespite his failure, Bakjur was named governor of Damascus by al-Aziz, and was joined by Ibn al-Jarrah. Ibn Killis, who was released and restored to his office after barely two months, immediately began working against the two. Bakjur gradually made himself unpopular to the Damascenes due to his cruelty, and after several failed efforts, in 989 Ibn Killis finally persuaded al-Aziz to replace Bakjur with one of the vizier's personal ''ghilm\u0101n'', [[Ya'qub al-Siqlabi]]. Bakjur fled to [[Raqqa]], from where he continued his unsuccessful attacks on Aleppo.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=324}} At the same time, Baltakin was sent to pacify the Bedouin tribes who were raiding the [[Hajj]] caravans, leading to the establishment of a Fatimid garrison at [[Wadi al-Qura]], north of [[Medina]].{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=324}}\n\nIbn Killis' death in 991 freed al-Aziz to pursue a more aggressive stance in the Aleppo question. Immediately he dismissed Ibn Killis' prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and appointed the Turk [[Manjutakin]] as governor of Damascus.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=324\u2013325}} Manjutakin's use of Damascus as his base during the subsequent campaigns shows the consolidation of Fatimid control in the area, but also, as Hugh Kennedy remarks, the changes it brought to the \"political and economic geography of Syria\": given the continued insecurity of the overland routes due to the depredations of the Bedouin, the Fatimids supplied their forces in Syria by sea\u2014notably via [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]]\u2014and as a result the chief coastal towns rose in importance, as centres of Fatimid control and administration as well as commerce, experiencing a revival which continued into the 12th century.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=325\u2013326}}\n\nManjutakin invaded the Hamdanid emirate, defeated a Byzantine force under the ''[[dux|doux]]'' of [[Antioch]], [[Michael Bourtzes]], in June 992, and laid siege to Aleppo. However, he failed to pursue the siege with vigour and the city was easily able to resist until, in the spring of 993, after thirteen months of campaigning, Manjutakin was forced to return to Damascus due to lack of supplies.{{sfn|Stevenson|1926|p=251}} In spring 994, Manjutakin launched another invasion, again defeated Bourtzes at the [[Battle of the Orontes]] in September and [[Siege of Aleppo (994\u2013995)|again besieged]] Aleppo. The blockade was far more effective this time and soon caused a severe lack of food, but the city's defenders held out until the sudden arrival of the Byzantine emperor, [[Basil II]], in person in April 995.{{sfn|Stevenson|1926|p=251}} Basil crossed [[Asia Minor]] in only sixteen days at the head of an army; his sudden arrival, and the exaggerated numbers circulating for his army, caused panic in the Fatimid army. Manjutakin burned his camp and retreated to Damascus without giving battle.{{sfn|Stevenson|1926|p=251}}\n\nThe Byzantines besieged [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] but failed to capture it; nevertheless, the Fatimids lost control of the city, which became independent under its ''[[qadi]]''.{{sfn|Lev|1995|p=202}} The Byzantine emperor then occupied and fortified [[Tartus]].{{sfn|Lev|1995|p=202}} Al-Aziz himself now prepared to take the field against the Byzantines himself, beginning large-scale preparations at Cairo.{{sfn|Lev|1995|p=203}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=325, 327}} Byzantine and Hamdanid embassies carrying proposals for a truce were received in September 995, but rejected.{{sfn|Lev|1995|p=203}} Al-Aziz's preparations were set back when the fleet being prepared at Cairo was destroyed by a fire, which set off an anti-Christian pogrom in the city.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=325}} Manjutakin was ordered to recapture Tartus, but its Armenian garrison was able to fend off his attacks; and a Fatimid fleet sent to assist the siege was lost in a storm off the coast.{{sfn|Lev|1995|p=202}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=325}} Al-Aziz died on 14 October 996, before setting out on his campaign.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=327}} The Byzantine\u2013Fatimid conflict continued under his successor until the conclusion of a ten-year truce in 1000.{{sfn|Lev|1995|pp=203\u2013205}}\n\n=== Arabia and North Africa ===\nAlong with Syria, al-Aziz presided over an expansion of Fatimid influence in the [[Arabian peninsula]]. The Hajj\u2014at least those caravans setting off from Cairo with the pilgrims of the western Islamic world\u2014was placed under Fatimid control and protection, despite the considerable cost.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=326}} The [[emirs of Mecca]], although ''de facto'' autonomous, recognized the Fatimids' suzerainty, in token of which the Fatimids enjoyed the prestigious privilege of furnishing each year the new cover of the [[Kaaba]] (the ''[[kiswa]]'').{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=326}} Finally, in 992 the Fatimids were acknowledged as caliphs in the [[Islamic history of Yemen|Yemen]],{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=326}} and even their old enemies, the Qarmatians of Bahrayn, came around to acknowledge their claims.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=326}} According to Kennedy, these diplomatic victories were the result of the more energetic foreign policy pursued by al-Aziz, particularly after the death of Ibn Killis, which bolstered his credentials by demonstrating \"his ability and willingness to undertake the two major public responsibilities of a caliph, to safeguard the Hajj and to lead the Muslims against the infidel Byzantines\".{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=326}}\n\nOn the other hand, [[North Africa]], including the former Fatimid heartland of Ifriqiya, was mostly neglected.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}} Effective power there had passed to the [[Zirid]] viceroy of Ifriqiya, [[Buluggin ibn Ziri]] ({{reign|972|984}}), who was confirmed in office by al-Aziz, as was his son [[al-Mansur ibn Buluggin|al-Mansur]] ({{reign|984|996}}).{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}} In 992, al-Aziz even confirmed al-Mansur's son [[Badis ibn Mansur|Badis]] as heir-apparent, thereby strengthening the Zirids' claim to dynastic succession.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=326}} Indeed, as Kennedy remarks, \"nothing is more striking than the speed with which [the Fatimids] were prepared to allow North Africa to go its own way\";{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=326}} apart from diplomatic exchanges of gifts,{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=326}} the Zirids governed their domains increasingly independently from the Fatimid court, even to the point of warring with the Kutama, the erstwhile mainstay of the Fatimid regime.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}} In a similar manner, al-Aziz contended himself with recognizing the succession of the [[Kalbid]] emirs of [[Emirate of Sicily|Sicily]] after the event.{{sfn|Canard|1960|p=824}} Nearer to Egypt, the governor of Barqa ([[Cyrenaica]]) is known to have brought presents to the court of Cairo, but otherwise there are no indications of the Fatimids' exercising any control over him.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=326}}\n\nAl-Aziz died on 13 October 996. His son [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]] (996-1021) succeeded him as Caliph.\n\n==Family==\nInformation about al-Aziz's consorts is unclear.{{sfn|Halm|2015|p=100}} His oldest surviving child was a daughter, [[Sitt al-Mulk]], born in 970. Her mother is designated as an ''[[umm walad]]'' in the sources, indicating that at some point she also bore al-Aziz a son, who apparently died in infancy. She is commonly identified with the ''Sayyida al-\u02bfAz\u012bz\u012bya'' (\"the Lady of Aziz\") who is frequently mentioned in the sources, and died in 995.{{sfn|Halm|2015|p=100}} In 979, al-Aziz married a cousin of his (the precise relation is unknown).{{sfn|Halm|2015|p=100}} He also had a third wife, a Byzantine Greek Christian, who was the mother of his successor, al-Hakim.{{sfn|Halm|2015|p=100}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Ismaili imams]]\n*[[List of rulers of Islamic Egypt]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite journal | title=The Career of Mu\u1e25ammad Ibn \u1e6cughj Al-Ikhsh\u012bd, a Tenth-Century Governor of Egypt | first=Jere L. | last=Bacharach | journal=Speculum | volume=50 | issue=4 | year=1975 | pages=586\u2013612 | jstor=2855469 | issn=0038-7134 | ref=harv | doi=10.2307/2855469}}\n* {{cite book | last=Brett | first=Michael | title=The Rise of the Fatimids: The World of the Mediterranean and the Middle East in the Fourth Century of the Hijra, Tenth Century CE | series=The Medieval Mediterranean | volume=30 | publisher=BRILL | location=Leiden | year=2001 | isbn=978-90-04-11741-9 | url={{Google Books | BqCdfhW3nVwC | plainurl=y}} | ref=harv}}\n* {{EI2 | last=Canard | first=Marius | authorlink=Marius Canard | title=al-\u02bfAz\u012bz Bi\u02bell\u0101h | volume=1 | pages=823\u2013825 | url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1573-3912_islam_SIM_0953}}\n* {{Daftary-The Ismailis | edition=Second}}\n* {{A History of Palestine, 634\u20131099}}\n* {{cite book | last=Halm | first=Heinz | authorlink=Heinz Halm | title=Die Kalifen von Kairo: Die F\u0101\u1e6dimiden in \u00c4gypten, 973\u20131074 | language=German | trans-title=The Caliphs of Cairo: The Fatimids in Egypt, 973\u20131074 | publisher=C.

The town, considered the capital of the island of Puerto Rico (which was at that time named ''Isla de San Juan Bautista''), was destroyed during the indigenous uprising of 1511, and the area was abandoned by Europeans for some years, during which time [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] (itself at first called Puerto Rico) became the capital of the island. The [[United States]] took control of Puerto Rico from [[Spain]] in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris of 1898]]. In 1899, the United States conducted its first census of Puerto Rico, finding that the population of Gu\u00e1nica barrio was 2,700.<ref name=\"OfficeSanger1900\">{{cite book|author1=Joseph Prentiss Sanger|author2=Henry Gannett|author3=Walter Francis Willcox|title=Informe sobre el censo de Puerto Rico, 1899, United States.

Miles]]) landed in Gu\u00e1nica as part of the course of the [[Puerto Rico Campaign|Puerto Rican Campaign]] in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. This invasion led to Puerto Rico being acquired by the United States. The invasion, just one small part of the war between Spain and United States, occurred in Gu\u00e1nica due to its sheltered harbor and proximity to [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]], besides being such an unexpected site for such an attack, which had been anticipated at the heavily fortified city of San Juan. The ''Gloucester'' was the first ship to set anchor in the Bay of Gu\u00e1nica. Twenty-eight sailors and [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]], under the command of lieutenants H. P. Huse and Wood, departed from the ship on rafts and landed on the beach. The Marines lowered the [[Flag of Spain|Spanish flag]] from the beach flagpole and replaced it with the [[American flag]]. They then proceeded to set up a machine gun nest and placed [[barbed wire]] around their perimeter. The first land skirmish in Puerto Rico between the Puerto Rican militia and the American forces occurred when Lt. M\u00e9ndez L\u00f3pez and his men attacked and opened fire on the Americans. During the small battle which followed, the Americans returned fire with their machine gun and the ''Gloucester'' began to bombard the Spanish position. Lt. M\u00e9ndez L\u00f3pez and three of his men were wounded and the militia unit was forced to retreat to the town of Yauco.<ref name=\"AAMPR\">{{cite web|accessdate=2008-08-02|url=http://www.spanamwar.com/puertoland2.htm|last=Barnes|first=Mark R.|title=The American Army Moves on Puerto-Rico, Part 2|work=War in Puerto Rico|publisher=Spanish American War Centennial Website|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724113938/http://spanamwar.com/puertoland2.htm|archive-date=2008-07-24|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"EDG\">{{cite web|accessdate=2008-08-02|url=http://home.coqui.net/sarrasin/desembarco.guanica.htm|title=El desembarco en Gu\u00e1nica|work=1898 La Guerra Hispano Americana en Puerto Rico|language=es|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421161340/http://home.coqui.net/sarrasin/desembarco.guanica.htm|archive-date=2010-04-21|url-status=live}}</ref> The invasion is commemorated by a contentious monument on the waterfront: along a broad paseo (''el malec\u00f3n''), there is a large coral boulder marked by the carved words, \"3rd Battalion, 1st U.S.V.

Miles]] and his men landed]]\nGu\u00e1nica is a modern town that maintains roots and connections to a traditional past. Known as ''el pueblo de la amistad'' ('the town of friendship'), it is also occasionally referred to as ''el pueblo de las doce calles'' ('the town of the twelve streets'). The central part of town consists of five streets running north\u2013south crossing seven other streets that run east\u2013west, resulting in a compact grid of 24 square blocks, one of which is the town plaza. Facing the plaza is the Catholic Church, city hall, a school, and many shops; the plaza itself contains greenery, walks, and a music stand. In recent years this central area of the twelve streets has been extensively supplemented by suburbs in the south and west. Hills surround the town and harbor, including the {{convert|450|ft|adj=on}} hill to the east of town, itself topped by the tiny Fort Capr\u00f3n. Two large factories, one producing fertilizer, partially distract the eye from the pleasant landscape, but both have been important to the economy of the town, at one time dominated by the sugar plantations of [[Central Gu\u00e1nica]]. The resort chain known as [[Club Med]] once attempted to set up a luxury resort on beaches east of the town, but withdrew due to local opposition which was apprehensive about both environmental and community degradation. East of the town some {{convert|200|acre|1}} of land, including {{convert|3|mi|spell=in}} of beach, have been intermittently for sale. It is a fishing village; commercial fishermen still ply their traditional trade beyond the harbor entrance. Copamarina Beach Resort & Spa offers beach access and a short boat ride to Giligan Island, which is a great spot to go snorkeling. The water is crystal clear and shallow, in which old pieces of coral and fish can be seen. People can walk from one island to another.\n\nOn January 6, 2020, a 5.8 magnitude earthquake was felt in Gu\u00e1nica and nearby municipalities, and several residences and cars were destroyed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/locales/nota/colapsancincoresidenciasenlabarriadaesperanzaenguanicaporeltemblor-2539008/|title=Colapsan cinco residencias en la barriada Esperanza en Gu\u00e1nica por el temblor [Five residences in the Esperanza neighborhood of Gu\u00e1nica collapse as a result of the earthquake] |date=January 6, 2020|website=El Nuevo Dia}}</ref> On January 7, 2020, a 6.4 magnitude earthquake hit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/06/us/puerto-rico-earthquake.html|title=Earthquake Strikes Puerto Rico, Toppling a Well-Known Natural Wonder|first1=Alejandra|last1=Rosa|first2=Patricia|last2=Mazzei|date=January 6, 2020|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Guayac\u00e1n Centenario, Gu\u00e1nica, Puerto Rico.jpg|thumb|Guayac\u00e1n Centenario]]\nGu\u00e1nica has mountains and a forest.

The largely [[intact forest landscape|intact forest]] of the Gu\u00e1nica Dry Forest reserve hosts the greatest number of bird species found on the island, including several bird species seldom found anywhere else: the [[Puerto Rican lizard cuckoo]], [[Puerto Rican woodpecker]], the [[Puerto Rican nightjar]], and the [[Puerto Rican emerald]] hummingbird. Other animals thought to be extinct in Puerto Rico have turned up in this forest. Many different types of cactus grow here, a stunning contrast to the lush [[El Yunque National Forest|Caribbean National Forest]] in the northeast part of the island, which is a [[tropical rainforest]]. The contrast is due to the mountain ridge ''[[Cordillera Central (Puerto Rico)|Cordillera Central]]'' which separates Gu\u00e1nica from the northeast part of the island; while the northeast receives over {{convert|100|in}} of precipitation each year, Gu\u00e1nica receives less than 30, and some regions of the forest reserve are said to receive only six inches.\n\nThe forest reserve of some {{convert|9500|acre|km2|0}} contains {{convert|36|mi|0}} of trails through four different forest types: [[deciduous]] trees, a coastal region with tree-size [[Asclepias|milkweed]] and {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall|spell=in}} [[Opuntia|prickly pear cactus]], a [[mahogany]] forest, and twisted [[Bursera simaruba|gumbo limbo trees]]. There are about 700 varieties of plants, including ''aroma'' ([[acacia]]) and ''[[Guaiacum officinale|guayacan]]'' (lignum vitae\u2014Latin for 'wood of life'). One ''guayacan'' is about 500\u2013700 years old. The squat melon cactus and other cacti can be found here along with 40 species of birds, including the ''guabairo'' (Puerto Rican nightjar), found nowhere else. Also in the area are a crested toad (Peltophryne lemur) and, sometimes on the beaches, green and leatherback turtles, though their eggs suffer severe predation from mongooses one time introduced to fight rats in sugar cane fields.\n\n===Barrios===\n[[File:Gu\u00e1nica, Puerto Rico locator map.png|thumb|Subdivisions of Gu\u00e1nica]]\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Gu\u00e1nica is subdivided into [[Barrios of Puerto Rico|barrios]].

The town, considered the capital of the island of Puerto Rico (which was at that time named ''Isla de San Juan Bautista''), was destroyed during the indigenous uprising of 1511, and the area was abandoned by Europeans for some years, during which time [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] (itself at first called Puerto Rico) became the capital of the island. The [[United States]] took control of Puerto Rico from [[Spain]] in the aftermath of the [[Spanish-American War]] under the terms of the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris of 1898]]. In 1899, the United States conducted its first census of Puerto Rico, finding that the population of Gu\u00e1nica barrio was 2,700.<ref name=\"OfficeSanger1900\">{{cite book|author1=Joseph Prentiss Sanger|author2=Henry Gannett|author3=Walter Francis Willcox|title=Informe sobre el censo de Puerto Rico, 1899, United States.

Miles]]) landed in Gu\u00e1nica as part of the course of the [[Puerto Rico Campaign|Puerto Rican Campaign]] in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. This invasion led to Puerto Rico being acquired by the United States. The invasion, just one small part of the war between Spain and United States, occurred in Gu\u00e1nica due to its sheltered harbor and proximity to [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]], besides being such an unexpected site for such an attack, which had been anticipated at the heavily fortified city of San Juan. The ''Gloucester'' was the first ship to set anchor in the Bay of Gu\u00e1nica. Twenty-eight sailors and [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]], under the command of lieutenants H. P. Huse and Wood, departed from the ship on rafts and landed on the beach. The Marines lowered the [[Flag of Spain|Spanish flag]] from the beach flagpole and replaced it with the [[American flag]]. They then proceeded to set up a machine gun nest and placed [[barbed wire]] around their perimeter. The first land skirmish in Puerto Rico between the Puerto Rican militia and the American forces occurred when Lt. M\u00e9ndez L\u00f3pez and his men attacked and opened fire on the Americans. During the small battle which followed, the Americans returned fire with their machine gun and the ''Gloucester'' began to bombard the Spanish position. Lt. M\u00e9ndez L\u00f3pez and three of his men were wounded and the militia unit was forced to retreat to the town of Yauco.<ref name=\"AAMPR\">{{cite web|accessdate=2008-08-02|url=http://www.spanamwar.com/puertoland2.htm|last=Barnes|first=Mark R.|title=The American Army Moves on Puerto-Rico, Part 2|work=War in Puerto Rico|publisher=Spanish American War Centennial Website|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724113938/http://spanamwar.com/puertoland2.htm|archive-date=2008-07-24|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"EDG\">{{cite web|accessdate=2008-08-02|url=http://home.coqui.net/sarrasin/desembarco.guanica.htm|title=El desembarco en Gu\u00e1nica|work=1898 La Guerra Hispano Americana en Puerto Rico|language=es|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421161340/http://home.coqui.net/sarrasin/desembarco.guanica.htm|archive-date=2010-04-21|url-status=live}}</ref> The invasion is commemorated by a contentious monument on the waterfront: along a broad paseo (''el malec\u00f3n''), there is a large coral boulder marked by the carved words, \"3rd Battalion, 1st U.S.V.

Miles]] and his men landed]]\nGu\u00e1nica is a modern town that maintains roots and connections to a traditional past. Known as ''el pueblo de la amistad'' ('the town of friendship'), it is also occasionally referred to as ''el pueblo de las doce calles'' ('the town of the twelve streets'). The central part of town consists of five streets running north\u2013south crossing seven other streets that run east\u2013west, resulting in a compact grid of 24 square blocks, one of which is the town plaza. Facing the plaza is the Catholic Church, city hall, a school, and many shops; the plaza itself contains greenery, walks, and a music stand. In recent years this central area of the twelve streets has been extensively supplemented by suburbs in the south and west. Hills surround the town and harbor, including the {{convert|450|ft|adj=on}} hill to the east of town, itself topped by the tiny Fort Capr\u00f3n. Two large factories, one producing fertilizer, partially distract the eye from the pleasant landscape, but both have been important to the economy of the town, at one time dominated by the sugar plantations of [[Central Gu\u00e1nica]]. The resort chain known as [[Club Med]] once attempted to set up a luxury resort on beaches east of the town, but withdrew due to local opposition which was apprehensive about both environmental and community degradation. East of the town some {{convert|200|acre|1}} of land, including {{convert|3|mi|spell=in}} of beach, have been intermittently for sale. It is a fishing village; commercial fishermen still ply their traditional trade beyond the harbor entrance. Copamarina Beach Resort & Spa offers beach access and a short boat ride to Giligan Island, which is a great spot to go snorkeling. The water is crystal clear and shallow, in which old pieces of coral and fish can be seen. People can walk from one island to another.\n\nOn January 6, 2020, a 5.8 magnitude earthquake was felt in Gu\u00e1nica and nearby municipalities, and several residences and cars were destroyed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/locales/nota/colapsancincoresidenciasenlabarriadaesperanzaenguanicaporeltemblor-2539008/|title=Colapsan cinco residencias en la barriada Esperanza en Gu\u00e1nica por el temblor [Five residences in the Esperanza neighborhood of Gu\u00e1nica collapse as a result of the earthquake] |date=January 6, 2020|website=El Nuevo Dia}}</ref> On January 7, 2020, a 6.4 magnitude earthquake hit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/06/us/puerto-rico-earthquake.html|title=Earthquake Strikes Puerto Rico, Toppling a Well-Known Natural Wonder|first1=Alejandra|last1=Rosa|first2=Patricia|last2=Mazzei|date=January 6, 2020|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Guayac\u00e1n Centenario, Gu\u00e1nica, Puerto Rico.jpg|thumb|Guayac\u00e1n Centenario]]\nGu\u00e1nica has mountains and a forest.

The largely [[intact forest landscape|intact forest]] of the Gu\u00e1nica Dry Forest reserve hosts the greatest number of bird species found on the island, including several bird species seldom found anywhere else: the [[Puerto Rican lizard cuckoo]], [[Puerto Rican woodpecker]], the [[Puerto Rican nightjar]], and the [[Puerto Rican emerald]] hummingbird. Other animals thought to be extinct in Puerto Rico have turned up in this forest. Many different types of cactus grow here, a stunning contrast to the lush [[El Yunque National Forest|Caribbean National Forest]] in the northeast part of the island, which is a [[tropical rainforest]]. The contrast is due to the mountain ridge ''[[Cordillera Central (Puerto Rico)|Cordillera Central]]'' which separates Gu\u00e1nica from the northeast part of the island; while the northeast receives over {{convert|100|in}} of precipitation each year, Gu\u00e1nica receives less than 30, and some regions of the forest reserve are said to receive only six inches.\n\nThe forest reserve of some {{convert|9500|acre|km2|0}} contains {{convert|36|mi|0}} of trails through four different forest types: [[deciduous]] trees, a coastal region with tree-size [[Asclepias|milkweed]] and {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall|spell=in}} [[Opuntia|prickly pear cactus]], a [[mahogany]] forest, and twisted [[Bursera simaruba|gumbo limbo trees]]. There are about 700 varieties of plants, including ''aroma'' ([[acacia]]) and ''[[Guaiacum officinale|guayacan]]'' (lignum vitae\u2014Latin for 'wood of life'). One ''guayacan'' is about 500\u2013700 years old. The squat melon cactus and other cacti can be found here along with 40 species of birds, including the ''guabairo'' (Puerto Rican nightjar), found nowhere else. Also in the area are a crested toad (Peltophryne lemur) and, sometimes on the beaches, green and leatherback turtles, though their eggs suffer severe predation from mongooses one time introduced to fight rats in sugar cane fields.\n\n===Barrios===\n[[File:Gu\u00e1nica, Puerto Rico locator map.png|thumb|Subdivisions of Gu\u00e1nica]]\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Gu\u00e1nica is subdivided into [[Barrios of Puerto Rico|barrios]].

These existed until 1290 when the Jewish population of England was expelled by King [[Edward I of England]].\n\nThere was never a corresponding expulsion from [[Scotland]].  The eminent scholar [[David Daiches]] states in his autobiographical ''Two Worlds: A Scottish born Jewish Childhood'' that there are grounds for saying that Scotland is the only Immigrant country with no history of state persecution of Jews.\n\nJews were re-admitted to England and [[Wales]] in 1656 by [[Oliver Cromwell]].  Slightly more than 200 years later, in 1858 they were [[Jewish emancipation|emancipated]], that is, accepted as full citizens.  In the late 19th century, there was mass Jewish [[immigration]] to England from Russia due to Russian domestic policy.  In the 1930s, the country accepted many refugees from [[Nazism]].  The Jewish population peaked at 450,000, but has since declined due to low birth-rate, [[interfaith marriage|intermarriage]] and [[emigration]], mainly of the younger generation to [[Israel]].  According to the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 census]], the current population is around 295,000, most of whom live in [[London]].\n\n==Academic figures==\n<!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD ANY MORE NAMES TO THIS PAGE WITHOUT INCLUDING A CREDIBLE SOURCE FOR THE INFORMATION.

THE SOURCE MUST SAY THAT THE PERSON IS ACTUALLY JEWISH.-->\n'''List of British Jews''' is a list of prominent [[Jews]] from the [[United Kingdom]] and its [[Countries of the United Kingdom|predecessor states]].\n\nAlthough the first Jews may have arrived on the island of Great Britain with the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], it was not until the [[Norman Conquest]] of [[William the Conqueror]] in 1066 that organised Jewish communities first appeared in [[England]].  These existed until 1290 when the Jewish population of England was expelled by King [[Edward I of England]].\n\nThere was never a corresponding expulsion from [[Scotland]].  The eminent scholar [[David Daiches]] states in his autobiographical ''Two Worlds: A Scottish born Jewish Childhood'' that there are grounds for saying that Scotland is the only Immigrant country with no history of state persecution of Jews.\n\nJews were re-admitted to England and [[Wales]] in 1656 by [[Oliver Cromwell]].  Slightly more than 200 years later, in 1858 they were [[Jewish emancipation|emancipated]], that is, accepted as full citizens.  In the late 19th century, there was mass Jewish [[immigration]] to England from Russia due to Russian domestic policy.  In the 1930s, the country accepted many refugees from [[Nazism]].  The Jewish population peaked at 450,000, but has since declined due to low birth-rate, [[interfaith marriage|intermarriage]] and [[emigration]], mainly of the younger generation to [[Israel]].  According to the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 census]], the current population is around 295,000, most of whom live in [[London]].\n\n==Academic figures==\n<!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD ANY MORE NAMES TO THIS PAGE WITHOUT INCLUDING A CREDIBLE SOURCE FOR THE INFORMATION.

It broke into revolt against the authority of the Caliph [[Ali]] after he agreed to arbitration with his rival, [[Muawiyah I]], to decide the succession to the [[Caliphate]] following the [[Battle of Siffin]] (657). A Kharijite later assassinated Ali, and for hundreds of years, the Khawarij were a source of insurrection against the Caliphate.\n\nThe Khawarij opposed arbitration as a means to choose a new ruler on the grounds that \"judgement belongs to God alone\". They considered arbitration a means for people to make decisions while the victor in a battle was determined by God. They believed that any Muslim\u2014even one who was not a [[Quraysh]] or even an [[Arabs|Arab]]\u2014could be the [[Imam]], the leader of the community, if he was morally irreproachable. If the leader sinned, it was the duty of Muslims to oppose and depose him. The only surviving sect of Khawarij are the [[Ibadis]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe term ''al-Khariji'' was used as an [[Exonym and endonym|exonym]] by their opponents from the fact that they left Ali's army. The name comes from the [[Semitic root|Arabic root]] {{lang|ar|[[:wikt:|\u062e \u0631 \u062c]]}}, which has the primary meaning \"to leave\" or \"to get out\",{{sfn|Francesca|2006|p=84}} as in the basic word {{lang|ar|[[:wikt:\u062e\u0631\u062c|\u062e\u0631\u062c]]}} \"to go out\".{{sfn|Watt|1973|p=15}}\n\nHowever, the group called themselves ''ash-Shurat'' \"the Exchangers\", which they understood within the context of Islamic scripture ({{cite quran|2|207|s=ns}}) and philosophy to mean \"those who have traded the mortal life ([[al-Dunya]]) for the other life [with God] ([[al-Akhirah]])\".<ref name=Glasse-255>{{cite book|last1=Glasse|first1=Cyril|title=The New Encyclopedia of Islam|date=2001|publisher=Altamira Press|location=California|isbn=978-0759101890|pages=[https://archive.org/details/newencyclopediao0000glas/page/255 255\u201356]|url=https://archive.org/details/newencyclopediao0000glas/page/255}}</ref>{{sfn|Levi Della Vida|1978|p=1075}}{{sfn|Francesca|2006|p=84}}<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World|last=Martin|first=Richard C.|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|year=2004|isbn=978-0028656038|location=|pages=390}}</ref>\n\n==Origin==\n{{Further|First Fitna|Muhakkima}}\nThe Kharijites originated during the [[First Fitna]], the struggle for political leadership over the Muslim community, following the assassination in 656 of the third caliph [[Uthman]].{{sfn|Watt|1973|p=9}} [[Ali]], a cousin and son-in-law of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]], was elected caliph but soon had to face with opposition, first from [[Talhah|Talha ibn Ubayd Allah]], [[Zubayr ibn al-Awam]] and Muhammad's widow [[A'isha]], whom he was able to defeat (November 656),{{sfn|Donner|2010|pp=157\u2013159}} and later from [[Muawiyah I|Mu'awiya]], the governor of [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]] and cousin of Uthman. Ali and Muwaiya faced each other at the [[Battle of Siffin]] in July 657. On the verge of defeat, Mu'awiya ordered his soldiers to hoist Qur'an on their lances; a signal to stop the fight and negotiate peace. The pious group of Qur'an readers (Qura) in Ali's army were moved by the gesture,{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=3}} which they interpreted as an appeal to the Book of God,{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=7}}{{sfn|Madelung|1997|p=238}} and demanded that Ali stop the fight immediately. Although unwilling, he had to yield under pressure and threats of violence against him.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=3}}{{sfn|Levi Della Vida|1978|p=1074}}{{sfn|Madelung|1997|p=238}} An arbitration committee was setup with representatives from both Ali and Mu'awiya's side with a mandate to settle the dispute in the light of the Qur'an.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=3}} While most of Ali's army accepted the agreement, one group, mostly from the tribe of Tamim, vehemently objected to the arbitration and raised the slogan \"judgment belongs to God alone\".{{sfn|Levi Della Vida|1978|p=1074}}\n\n===Harura===\nAs Ali marched back to [[Kufa]], his capital, resentment against the arbitration became widespread in his army. Some 12,000 dissenters seceded from the army and went to a place called Harura. They thus became known as the Harurites.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=3}} They held that the third caliph Uthman had deserved his death because of his faults, and that Ali was the legitimate caliph, while Mu'awiya was a rebel.{{sfn|Francesca|2006|pp=84\u201385}} They believed that the Qur'an clearly stated that as a rebel Mu'awiya was not entitled to arbitration, but rather should be fought until he repented, pointing to the verse:{{sfn|Francesca|2006|pp=84\u201385}}<ref name=OEIW>{{cite encyclopedia |author=John Alden Williams |author2=Justin Corfield |title=Khaw\u0101rij |encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World |editor=John L.

Yet if one is rebellious to the other, then fight the insolent one until it returns to God\u200a's command. (Quran 49:9)}}\n\nThey held that in agreeing to arbitration Ali committed the grave sin of rejecting God's judgment (''[[hukm]]'') and attempted to substitute human judgment for God's clear injunction, which prompted their motto \"judgement belongs to God alone\" (''la hukma illa li-llah'').<ref name=OEIW/>{{sfn|Hawting|1978|p=460}} From this expression, which they were the first to use as a motto, they became known as ''[[Muhakkima]]''.{{sfn|Djebli|2000|p=107}} They also believed that Muslims owe allegiance only to the Quran and the sunna of Muhammad, Abu Bakr, and Umar, and denied that the right to the imamate should be based on close kinship with Muhammad.{{sfn|Francesca|2006|pp=84\u201385}}\n\nAli, after some time, visited the Harura camp and in order to win back their support argued that it was them who forced him to accept arbitration proposal despite his warnings against it. They acknowledged that they had sinned but argued that they had repented and asked Ali to do the same, which he did in very general and ambiguous terms. They subsequently offered back their allegiance to him and returned to Kufa on the condition that war against Mu'awiya be resumed within six months.{{sfn|Madelung|1997|pp=248\u2013249}}\n\n===Nahrawan===\nThe arbitration proceedings continued however and after a few months (March 658),{{sfn|Levi Della Vida|1978|p=1074}} when Ali refused to denounce the arbitration and sent his arbitration delegation headed by [[Abu Musa Ash'ari]] to carry out the talks, Kharijites denounced Ali's caliphate and elected [[Abd Allah ibn Wahb al-Rasibi]] their caliph. In order to avoid being detected, they moved out of Kufa in small groups and went to a place called Nahrawan on the east bank of [[Tigris]]. Some five hundred of their [[Basra|Basran]] comrades were informed and they too joined them in Nahrawan, amounting to a total of 4,000 men.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=17\u201318}}{{sfn|Madelung|1997|pp=251\u2013252}} Following this exodus, they were called as Khawarij.{{sfn|Levi Della Vida|1978|pp=1074\u20131075}} They declared Ali and his followers apostates and killed several people who did not share their views.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=17\u201318}}\n\nIn the meantime, arbitrators declared that Uthman had been killed unjustly by the rebels. Other than that, however, they could not agree on anything substantial and the process collapsed. Ali now denounced the arbitrators and called on his supporters for renewed war against Mu'awiya.{{sfn|Donner|2010|p=163}} He invited Kharijites to join him in war against Mu'awiya as before. They refused to do so unless he would acknowledge that he had gone astray and repent. Ali consequently decided to depart for Syria without them.{{sfn|Madelung|1997|p=258}} On the way, however, he received news of the Kharijites' murdering various people, and was urged by his followers, who feared for their families and property in Kufa, to deal with the Kharijites first.{{sfn|Madelung|1997|p=259}} Kharijites refused to surrender the murderers and consequently Ali's attacked them in their camp, inflicting a heavy defeat on them at the [[Battle of Nahrawan]] (July 658), killing Ibn Wahb and most of his supporters.{{sfn|Levi Della Vida|1978|pp=1074\u20131075}} Some 1200 of them, however, surrendered and were spared.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=18}} This bloodshed sealed the split of Kharijites from Ali's followers, and Kharijite calls for revenge ultimately led to Ali's assassination in 661 by a Kharijite.{{sfn|Levi Della Vida|1978|pp=1074\u20131075}}{{sfn|Francesca|2006|pp=84\u201385}}\n\n== Later history ==\n\nFor hundreds of years the Khawarij continued to be a source of insurrection against the Caliphate.<ref name=Glasse-255/> Five small Kharijite revolts, involving about 200 men each, following Nahrawan were defeated during the caliphate of Ali.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=18}}{{sfn|Watt|1973|p=19}} Under Mu'awiya, Basra replaced Kufa as the center of Kharijite disturbance. His governors of Iraq [[Ziyad ibn Abihi]] and [[Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad]] dealt with Kharijites with a heavy-hand and sixteen Kharijite revolts, with rebel numbers in individual revolts varying between 30 to 500, were suppressed.{{sfn|Watt|1973|p=19}} From now on, they started the practice of raiding undefended towns in the neighborhoods of Basra in rapid cavalry attacks whereby they would seem to appear from nowhere, pillage the towns and disappear quickly before the government forces could respond. If pursued, they would flee into mountainous regions of Iran.{{sfn|Levi Della Vida|1978|p=1075}} In Basra, Ibn Ziyad is reported to have been particularly hard on them. He jailed any Kharijite whom he suspected of being dangerous and executed several Kharijite sympathizers who had publicly spoken against him.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|pp=25\u201326}} To avoid suppression, Basran Kharijites fled to Arabia around 680 CE.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=27}}\n\n===Second Fitna===\nAfter the death of Mua'wiya in 680, the empire fell to civil war over the question of leadership. The people of Hejaz (where Mecca and Medina are located) rebelled against the new caliph [[Yazid I|Yazid]].{{sfn|Donner|2010|pp=177, 181}} When Yazid sent an army to end the Hijazi rebellion in 683 and [[Siege of Mecca (683)|Mecca was besieged]], Kharijites assisted [[Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr]], who was based on Mecca and opposed Yazid, in defending the city.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=27}} However, Yazid died soon afterwards and Ibn al-Zubayr proclaimed himself caliph. Kharijites, after discovering that Ibn al-Zubayr had proclaimed caliphate and did not share their view of Uthman and condemned his murder, abandoned him{{sfn|Rotter|1982|p=80}} and went to Basra. Basran tribal chiefs expelled Ibn Ziyad and the city fell to civil war. Karijites took over the city, killed the deputy appointed by Ibn Ziyad and broke 140 of their comrades free from Ibn Ziyad's prison.{{sfn|Morony|1984|p=473}}\n\nThey aroused condemnation by mainstream scholars such as  14th-century Muslim Ismail [[ibn Kathir]] who wrote, \"If they ever gained strength, they would surely corrupt the whole of the Earth, Iraq and [[Syria (region)|Shaam]] \u2013 they would not leave a baby, male or female, neither a man or a woman, because as far as they are concerned the people have caused corruption, a corruption that cannot be rectified except by mass killing.\"<ref name=\"theglobeandmail.com\"/>\nIn a similar vein, the 10th century Islamic scholar [[Abu Bakr al-Ajurri]] said, \"None of the scholars, in either past or recent times, ever disagreed that the Khawarij are an evil group, disobedient to Allah Almighty and to His Messenger - Peace Be Upon Him. Even if they pray, fast, or strive in worship, it does not benefit them, and even if they openly enjoin good and forbid evil it does not benefit them, as they are a people who interpret the Quran according to their desire.\"<ref name=\"al-Yaqoubi3\">{{Cite book | last = Al-Yaqoubi | first = Muhammad |authorlink=Muhammad al-Yaqoubi| year = 2015 | title = Refuting ISIS: A Rebuttal Of Its Religious And Ideological Foundations | page = 20| publisher = Sacred Knowledge |isbn=978-1908224125| title-link = Refuting ISIS: A Rebuttal Of Its Religious And Ideological Foundations }}</ref> One modern historian describes Khawarij as \"[[bedouin]] nomads who resented the centralization of power in the new Islamic state that curtailed the freedom of their tribal society.\"<ref name=Schultz-1981-175>{{cite book|last1=Schultz|first1=Joseph P.|title=Judaism and the Gentile Faiths: Comparative Studies in Religion|date=1981|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press|page=175|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dchpiP-9YQAC&pg=PA175|quote=bedouin nomads who resented the centralization of power in the new Islamic state that curtailed the freedom of their tribal society.|isbn=9780838617076|access-date=2015-10-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214171402/https://books.google.com/books?id=dchpiP-9YQAC&pg=PA175|archive-date=2017-02-14|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==In hadith==\nAmong the hadith that refer to the Khawarij (according to some sources) include:\n\nAfter the [[Battle of Hunayn]], a man named Dhu aI-Khuwaisira is reported to have accused Muhammad of unjustly distributing the spoils. Umar reportedly asked for Muhammad's permission to kill the man, but the latter declined, saying:{{quote|text=Let him go, there will be people from him who will pray and fast so eagerly that your prayer and fasting will seem comparatively small to you; they plunge so deeply into the religion that they come out on the other side, like a sharp arrow through a target on which no trace of blood and flesh remains.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|pp=15\u201316}}}} According to German historian [[Julius Wellhausen]], the report is a fabrication and was invented retrospectively.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|pp=15\u201316}}\n\n{{QuoteHadith|Abu Dharr|matn=Allah's Messenger (saws) said: Verily there would arise from my Ummah after me a group (of people) who would recite the Quran, but it would not go beyond their throats, and they would pass clean through their religion just as the arrow passes through the prey, and they would never come back to it. They would be the worst among the creation and the creatures.|<ref>[[Sahih Muslim]] Hadith 2335</ref>}}\n\n==Beliefs and practices==\n{{Aqidah|Other}}\n===Early Muslim governance===\nThe Khawarij considered the caliphate of [[Abu Bakr]] and [[Umar]] to be rightly guided but believed that Uthman had deviated from the path of justice and truth in the last days of his caliphate and hence was liable to be killed or displaced. They also believed that Ali committed a grave sin when he agreed on the arbitration with Muawiyah. The Kharijites thus deemed the arbitrators (Abu Musa Ashaari and 'Amr ibn al-'As), the leaders who appointed these arbitrators (Ali and Muawiyah I) and all those who agreed on the arbitration (all companions of Ali and Muawiyah]) as [[Kafir|kuffar]] \"disbelievers\", as they had breached the rules of the Qur'an.

It broke into revolt against the authority of the Caliph [[Ali]] after he agreed to arbitration with his rival, [[Muawiyah I]], to decide the succession to the [[Caliphate]] following the [[Battle of Siffin]] (657). A Kharijite later assassinated Ali, and for hundreds of years, the Khawarij were a source of insurrection against the Caliphate.\n\nThe Khawarij opposed arbitration as a means to choose a new ruler on the grounds that \"judgement belongs to God alone\". They considered arbitration a means for people to make decisions while the victor in a battle was determined by God. They believed that any Muslim\u2014even one who was not a [[Quraysh]] or even an [[Arabs|Arab]]\u2014could be the [[Imam]], the leader of the community, if he was morally irreproachable. If the leader sinned, it was the duty of Muslims to oppose and depose him. The only surviving sect of Khawarij are the [[Ibadis]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe term ''al-Khariji'' was used as an [[Exonym and endonym|exonym]] by their opponents from the fact that they left Ali's army. The name comes from the [[Semitic root|Arabic root]] {{lang|ar|[[:wikt:|\u062e \u0631 \u062c]]}}, which has the primary meaning \"to leave\" or \"to get out\",{{sfn|Francesca|2006|p=84}} as in the basic word {{lang|ar|[[:wikt:\u062e\u0631\u062c|\u062e\u0631\u062c]]}} \"to go out\".{{sfn|Watt|1973|p=15}}\n\nHowever, the group called themselves ''ash-Shurat'' \"the Exchangers\", which they understood within the context of Islamic scripture ({{cite quran|2|207|s=ns}}) and philosophy to mean \"those who have traded the mortal life ([[al-Dunya]]) for the other life [with God] ([[al-Akhirah]])\".<ref name=Glasse-255>{{cite book|last1=Glasse|first1=Cyril|title=The New Encyclopedia of Islam|date=2001|publisher=Altamira Press|location=California|isbn=978-0759101890|pages=[https://archive.org/details/newencyclopediao0000glas/page/255 255\u201356]|url=https://archive.org/details/newencyclopediao0000glas/page/255}}</ref>{{sfn|Levi Della Vida|1978|p=1075}}{{sfn|Francesca|2006|p=84}}<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World|last=Martin|first=Richard C.|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|year=2004|isbn=978-0028656038|location=|pages=390}}</ref>\n\n==Origin==\n{{Further|First Fitna|Muhakkima}}\nThe Kharijites originated during the [[First Fitna]], the struggle for political leadership over the Muslim community, following the assassination in 656 of the third caliph [[Uthman]].{{sfn|Watt|1973|p=9}} [[Ali]], a cousin and son-in-law of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]], was elected caliph but soon had to face with opposition, first from [[Talhah|Talha ibn Ubayd Allah]], [[Zubayr ibn al-Awam]] and Muhammad's widow [[A'isha]], whom he was able to defeat (November 656),{{sfn|Donner|2010|pp=157\u2013159}} and later from [[Muawiyah I|Mu'awiya]], the governor of [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]] and cousin of Uthman. Ali and Muwaiya faced each other at the [[Battle of Siffin]] in July 657. On the verge of defeat, Mu'awiya ordered his soldiers to hoist Qur'an on their lances; a signal to stop the fight and negotiate peace. The pious group of Qur'an readers (Qura) in Ali's army were moved by the gesture,{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=3}} which they interpreted as an appeal to the Book of God,{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=7}}{{sfn|Madelung|1997|p=238}} and demanded that Ali stop the fight immediately.

Some 12,000 dissenters seceded from the army and went to a place called Harura. They thus became known as the Harurites.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=3}} They held that the third caliph Uthman had deserved his death because of his faults, and that Ali was the legitimate caliph, while Mu'awiya was a rebel.{{sfn|Francesca|2006|pp=84\u201385}} They believed that the Qur'an clearly stated that as a rebel Mu'awiya was not entitled to arbitration, but rather should be fought until he repented, pointing to the verse:{{sfn|Francesca|2006|pp=84\u201385}}<ref name=OEIW>{{cite encyclopedia |author=John Alden Williams |author2=Justin Corfield |title=Khaw\u0101rij |encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World |editor=John L.

They acknowledged that they had sinned but argued that they had repented and asked Ali to do the same, which he did in very general and ambiguous terms. They subsequently offered back their allegiance to him and returned to Kufa on the condition that war against Mu'awiya be resumed within six months.{{sfn|Madelung|1997|pp=248\u2013249}}\n\n===Nahrawan===\nThe arbitration proceedings continued however and after a few months (March 658),{{sfn|Levi Della Vida|1978|p=1074}} when Ali refused to denounce the arbitration and sent his arbitration delegation headed by [[Abu Musa Ash'ari]] to carry out the talks, Kharijites denounced Ali's caliphate and elected [[Abd Allah ibn Wahb al-Rasibi]] their caliph. In order to avoid being detected, they moved out of Kufa in small groups and went to a place called Nahrawan on the east bank of [[Tigris]]. Some five hundred of their [[Basra|Basran]] comrades were informed and they too joined them in Nahrawan, amounting to a total of 4,000 men.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=17\u201318}}{{sfn|Madelung|1997|pp=251\u2013252}} Following this exodus, they were called as Khawarij.{{sfn|Levi Della Vida|1978|pp=1074\u20131075}} They declared Ali and his followers apostates and killed several people who did not share their views.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=17\u201318}}\n\nIn the meantime, arbitrators declared that Uthman had been killed unjustly by the rebels. Other than that, however, they could not agree on anything substantial and the process collapsed. Ali now denounced the arbitrators and called on his supporters for renewed war against Mu'awiya.{{sfn|Donner|2010|p=163}} He invited Kharijites to join him in war against Mu'awiya as before. They refused to do so unless he would acknowledge that he had gone astray and repent. Ali consequently decided to depart for Syria without them.{{sfn|Madelung|1997|p=258}} On the way, however, he received news of the Kharijites' murdering various people, and was urged by his followers, who feared for their families and property in Kufa, to deal with the Kharijites first.{{sfn|Madelung|1997|p=259}} Kharijites refused to surrender the murderers and consequently Ali's attacked them in their camp, inflicting a heavy defeat on them at the [[Battle of Nahrawan]] (July 658), killing Ibn Wahb and most of his supporters.{{sfn|Levi Della Vida|1978|pp=1074\u20131075}} Some 1200 of them, however, surrendered and were spared.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=18}} This bloodshed sealed the split of Kharijites from Ali's followers, and Kharijite calls for revenge ultimately led to Ali's assassination in 661 by a Kharijite.{{sfn|Levi Della Vida|1978|pp=1074\u20131075}}{{sfn|Francesca|2006|pp=84\u201385}}\n\n== Later history ==\n\nFor hundreds of years the Khawarij continued to be a source of insurrection against the Caliphate.<ref name=Glasse-255/> Five small Kharijite revolts, involving about 200 men each, following Nahrawan were defeated during the caliphate of Ali.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=18}}{{sfn|Watt|1973|p=19}} Under Mu'awiya, Basra replaced Kufa as the center of Kharijite disturbance. His governors of Iraq [[Ziyad ibn Abihi]] and [[Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad]] dealt with Kharijites with a heavy-hand and sixteen Kharijite revolts, with rebel numbers in individual revolts varying between 30 to 500, were suppressed.{{sfn|Watt|1973|p=19}} From now on, they started the practice of raiding undefended towns in the neighborhoods of Basra in rapid cavalry attacks whereby they would seem to appear from nowhere, pillage the towns and disappear quickly before the government forces could respond. If pursued, they would flee into mountainous regions of Iran.{{sfn|Levi Della Vida|1978|p=1075}} In Basra, Ibn Ziyad is reported to have been particularly hard on them. He jailed any Kharijite whom he suspected of being dangerous and executed several Kharijite sympathizers who had publicly spoken against him.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|pp=25\u201326}} To avoid suppression, Basran Kharijites fled to Arabia around 680 CE.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=27}}\n\n===Second Fitna===\nAfter the death of Mua'wiya in 680, the empire fell to civil war over the question of leadership. The people of Hejaz (where Mecca and Medina are located) rebelled against the new caliph [[Yazid I|Yazid]].{{sfn|Donner|2010|pp=177, 181}} When Yazid sent an army to end the Hijazi rebellion in 683 and [[Siege of Mecca (683)|Mecca was besieged]], Kharijites assisted [[Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr]], who was based on Mecca and opposed Yazid, in defending the city.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=27}} However, Yazid died soon afterwards and Ibn al-Zubayr proclaimed himself caliph. Kharijites, after discovering that Ibn al-Zubayr had proclaimed caliphate and did not share their view of Uthman and condemned his murder, abandoned him{{sfn|Rotter|1982|p=80}} and went to Basra. Basran tribal chiefs expelled Ibn Ziyad and the city fell to civil war. Karijites took over the city, killed the deputy appointed by Ibn Ziyad and broke 140 of their comrades free from Ibn Ziyad's prison.{{sfn|Morony|1984|473}}\n\nThey aroused condemnation by mainstream scholars such as  14th-century Muslim Ismail [[ibn Kathir]] who wrote, \"If they ever gained strength, they would surely corrupt the whole of the Earth, Iraq and [[Syria (region)|Shaam]] \u2013 they would not leave a baby, male or female, neither a man or a woman, because as far as they are concerned the people have caused corruption, a corruption that cannot be rectified except by mass killing.\"<ref name=\"theglobeandmail.com\"/>\nIn a similar vein, the 10th century Islamic scholar [[Abu Bakr al-Ajurri]] said, \"None of the scholars, in either past or recent times, ever disagreed that the Khawarij are an evil group, disobedient to Allah Almighty and to His Messenger - Peace Be Upon Him.

They also believed that Ali committed a grave sin when he agreed on the arbitration with Muawiyah. The Kharijites thus deemed the arbitrators (Abu Musa Ashaari and 'Amr ibn al-'As), the leaders who appointed these arbitrators (Ali and Muawiyah I) and all those who agreed on the arbitration (all companions of Ali and Muawiyah]) as [[Kafir|kuffar]] \"disbelievers\", as they had breached the rules of the Qur'an.

Shi'a believe that the [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|imamate]] was the right of Ali, and the rule of the first three Rashidun caliphs was unlawful.

It has a maximum wingspan of {{convert|3.3|m|ftin|abbr=on}}{{sfn|Richard P.

The head and neck are nearly featherless, and are a dull red color, which may flush and therefore change color in response to the bird's emotional state. In the male, there is a wattle on the neck and a large, dark red [[Comb (anatomy)|comb]] or caruncle on the crown of the head. Unlike most [[bird of prey|birds of prey]], the male is larger than the female.\n\nThe condor is primarily a [[scavenger]], feeding on [[carrion]]. It prefers large carcasses, such as those of [[deer]] or [[cattle]]. It reaches sexual maturity at five or six years of age and [[Bird nest|nests]] at elevations of up to {{convert|5000|m|ft|abbr=on}}, generally on inaccessible rock ledges. One or two eggs are usually laid. It is one of the world's longest-living birds, with a lifespan of over 70 years in some cases.\n\nThe Andean condor is a national symbol of [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], and [[Peru]] and plays an important role in the [[folklore]] and [[mythology]] of the Andean regions. The Andean condor is considered [[Near Threatened|near threatened]] by the [[IUCN]].<ref name=IUCN/> It is threatened by habitat loss and by [[secondary poisoning]] from carcasses killed by hunters. [[Captive breeding]] programs have been instituted in several countries.\n\n==Taxonomy and systematics==\nThe Andean condor was described by [[Sweden|Swedish]] scientist [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1758 in the [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|tenth edition]] of his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' and retains its original [[binomial nomenclature|binomial]] name of ''Vultur gryphus''.<ref>{{cite book | last=Linnaeus | first=C | authorlink=Carl Linnaeus | title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis.

The head and neck are nearly featherless, and are a dull red color, which may flush and therefore change color in response to the bird's emotional state. In the male, there is a wattle on the neck and a large, dark red [[Comb (anatomy)|comb]] or caruncle on the crown of the head. Unlike most [[bird of prey|birds of prey]], the male is larger than the female.\n\nThe condor is primarily a [[scavenger]], feeding on [[carrion]]. It prefers large carcasses, such as those of [[deer]] or [[cattle]]. It reaches sexual maturity at five or six years of age and [[Bird nest|nests]] at elevations of up to {{convert|5000|m|ft|abbr=on}}, generally on inaccessible rock ledges. One or two eggs are usually laid. It is one of the world's longest-living birds, with a lifespan of over 70 years in some cases.\n\nThe Andean condor is a national symbol of [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], and [[Peru]] and plays an important role in the [[folklore]] and [[mythology]] of the Andean regions. The Andean condor is considered [[Near Threatened|near threatened]] by the [[IUCN]].<ref name=IUCN/> It is threatened by habitat loss and by [[secondary poisoning]] from carcasses killed by hunters. [[Captive breeding]] programs have been instituted in several countries.\n\n==Taxonomy and systematics==\nThe Andean condor was described by [[Sweden|Swedish]] scientist [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1758 in the [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|tenth edition]] of his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' and retains its original [[binomial nomenclature|binomial]] name of ''Vultur gryphus''.<ref>{{cite book | last=Linnaeus | first=C | authorlink=Carl Linnaeus | title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis.
