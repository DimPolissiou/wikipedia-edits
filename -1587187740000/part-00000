We have Domesday compiled 1086. From the scarcity of surnames in that record no clear reference to the Ketts of East Anglia is forthcoming, but christian names similar to those of the earliest recorded members of the Kett family have been found. They have been abstracted from the Norfolk Domesday and closely analysed. It is worth noting that the association of one group of Godwins, Hughs, and Huberts indicates a probable derivation from Toka, a \" francigena \" or foreigner (another word is used for Frank or Frenchman).

The community believed that [[Jesus]] had already returned in AD 70, making it possible for them to bring about [[Millennialism|Jesus's millennial kingdom]] themselves, and be free of sin and perfect in this world, not just in [[Heaven]] (a belief called ''[[Christian perfection|perfectionism]]''). The Oneida Community practiced [[communalism]] (in the sense of communal property and possessions), [[complex marriage]], [[Coitus reservatus|male sexual continence]], and mutual criticism.  There were smaller Noyesian communities in [[Wallingford, Connecticut]]; [[Newark, New Jersey]]; [[Putney, Vermont|Putney]] and [[Cambridge, Vermont]].{{sfn |Chmielewski |2001 |pp=176\u2013178}} The community's original 87 members grew to 172 by February 1850, 208 by 1852, and 306 by 1878. The branches were closed in 1854 except for the Wallingford branch, which operated until devastated by a [[1878 Wallingford tornado|tornado]] in 1878. The Oneida Community dissolved in 1881, and eventually became the [[Cutlery|silverware]] company [[Oneida Limited]].{{sfn |Hays |1999}}\n\n== Community structure ==\nEven though the community only reached a maximum population of about 300, it had a complex bureaucracy of 27 standing committees and 48 administrative sections.{{sfn |MacHovec |2010}}{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe manufacturing of silverware, the sole remaining industry, began in 1877, relatively late in the life of the community, and still exists.{{sfn |Hays |1999}} Secondary industries included the manufacture of leather travel bags, the weaving of [[palm frond]] hats, the construction of rustic garden furniture, game traps, and tourism.\n\nAll community members were expected to work, each according to his or her abilities. Women tended to do many of the domestic duties.{{sfn |Kern |1981 |p=}}{{Page needed|date=March 2020}} Although more skilled jobs tended to remain with an individual member (the financial manager, for example, held his post throughout the life of the community), community members rotated through the more unskilled jobs, working in the house, the fields, or the various industries. As Oneida thrived, it began to hire outsiders to work in these positions as well. They were a major employer in the area, with approximately 200 employees by 1870.\n\n=== Complex marriage ===\nThe Oneida community strongly believed in a system of [[free love]] (a term which Noyes is credited with coining) which was known as complex marriage,{{sfn |Foster |1997 |p=}} where any member was free to have sex with any other who consented.{{sfn |Stoehr |1979 |p=}}{{page needed|date=April 2020}} Possessiveness and exclusive relationships were frowned upon.{{sfn |DeMaria |1978 |p=83}} Unlike 20th-century social movements such as the [[Sexual Revolution]] of the 1960s, the Oneidans did not seek consequence-free sex for pleasure, but believed that, because the natural outcome of intercourse was pregnancy, raising children should be a communal responsibility. Women over the age of 40 were to act as sexual \"mentors\" to adolescent boys, because these relationships had a minimal chance of conceiving. Furthermore, these women became religious role models for the young men. Likewise, older men often introduced young women to sex. Noyes often used his own judgment in determining the partnerships that would form, and he would often encourage relationships between the non-devout and the devout in the community, in the hope that the attitudes and behaviors of the devout would influence the attitudes of the non-devout.{{sfn |Noyes |1937 |p=}}{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn 1993, the archives of the community were made available to scholars for the first time. Contained within the archives was the journal of Tirzah Miller,{{sfn |Herrick |Fogarty |2000 |p=}} Noyes' niece, who wrote extensively about her romantic and sexual relations with other members of Oneida.{{sfn |Chmielewski |2001 |pp=176\u2013178}}\n\n=== Mutual criticism ===\nEvery member of the community was subject to criticism by committee or the community as a whole, during a general meeting.{{sfn |Noyes |Oneida Community |1876}} The goal was to eliminate undesirable character traits.<ref>Parker, Robert Allerton (1935).

Putnam's Sons, p. 215.</ref> Various contemporary sources contend that Noyes himself was the subject of criticism, although less often and of probably less severe criticism than the rest of the community. Charles Nordhoff said he had witnessed the criticism of a member he referred to as \"Charles\", writing the following account of the incident:\n\n{{quote|Charles sat speechless, looking before him; but as the accusations multiplied, his face grew paler, and drops of perspiration began to stand on his forehead. The remarks I have reported took up about half an hour; and now, each one in the circle having spoken, Mr. Noyes summed up. He said that Charles had some serious faults; that he had watched him with some care; and that he thought the young man was earnestly trying to cure himself. He spoke in general praise of his ability, his good character, and of certain temptations he had resisted in the course of his life. He thought he saw signs that Charles was making a real and earnest attempt to conquer his faults; and as one evidence of this, he remarked that Charles had lately come to him to consult him upon a difficult case in which he had had a severe struggle, but had in the end succeeded in doing right. \"In the course of what we call stirpiculture\", said Noyes, \"Charles, as you know, is in the situation of one who is by and by to become a father. Under these circumstances, he has fallen under the too common temptation of selfish love, and a desire to wait upon and cultivate an exclusive intimacy with the woman who was to bear a child through him. This is an insidious temptation, very apt to attack people under such circumstances; but it must nevertheless be struggled against.\" Charles, he went on to say, had come to him for advice in this case, and he (Noyes) had at first refused to tell him any thing, but had asked him what he thought he ought to do; that after some conversation, Charles had determined, and he agreed with him, that he ought to isolate himself entirely from the woman, and let another man take his place at her side; and this Charles had accordingly done, with a most praiseworthy spirit of selfsacrifice. Charles had indeed still further taken up his cross, as he had noticed with pleasure, by going to sleep with the smaller children, to take charge of them during the night. Taking all this in view, he thought Charles was in a fair way to become a better man, and had manifested a sincere desire to improve, and to rid himself of all selfish faults.{{sfn |Nordhoff |1875 |pp=[https://archive.org/stream/communisticsoci00nord#page/292/mode/2up 292&ndash;293]}}}}\n\n=== Male continence ===\nTo control reproduction within the Oneida community, a system of male continence or [[coitus reservatus]] was enacted.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sandeen |first1=Ernest R. |title=John Humphrey Noyes as the New Adam |journal=Church History |date=March 1971 |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=82\u201390 |doi=10.2307/3163109 |jstor=3163109}}</ref> John Humprey Noyes decided that sexual intercourse served two distinct purposes.

Some of these privileges included not having to care for their own children as Oneida had a communal child care system, as well as freedom from unwanted pregnancies with Oneida's [[Coitus reservatus|male continence]] practice. In addition, they were able to wear functional, [[Bloomers (clothing)|Bloomer]]-style clothing and maintain short haircuts. Women were able to participate in practically all types of community work.{{sfn |Foster |1991 |pp=[https://archive.org/details/womenfamilyutopi0000fost/page/91 91\u2013102]}}  While domestic duties remained a primarily female responsibility, women were free to explore positions in business and sales, or as artisans or craftsmen, and many did so, particularly in the late 1860s and early 1870s.{{sfn |Kern |1981 |p=260}} Last, women had an active role in shaping commune policy, participating in the daily religious and business meetings.{{sfn |Foster |1991 |pp=[https://archive.org/details/womenfamilyutopi0000fost/page/91 91\u2013102]}}\n\nThe [[Group marriage|complex marriage]] and free love systems practiced at Oneida further acknowledged female status.

A woman's right to satisfying sexual experiences was recognized, and women were encouraged to have orgasms.{{sfn |Kern |1981 |pp=224, 232}} However, a woman's right of refusing a sexual overture was limited depending on the status of the man who made the advance.{{sfn |Kern |1981 |p=241}}\n\nEllen Wayland-Smith, author of \"The Status and Self-Perception of Women in the Oneida Community\", said that men and women had roughly equal status in the community. She points out that while both sexes were ultimately subject to Noyes' vision and will, women did not suffer any undue oppression.{{sfn |Wayland-Smith |1988 |p=49}}\n\n== Interactions with wider society ==\nThe community experienced freedom from wider society. The previously mentioned unorthodox marital, sexual, and religious practices caused them to face some criticism.

These are the best known instances of conflict and peace resolution.\n\n=== Outsider criticism ===\nIn 1870, a \"nineteenth century cultural critic\" Dr. John B.

Dr. Ellis described this as an attack on the prevailing moral order.{{sfn |Ellis |1870 ||pp=10\u201313}}{{Primary source inline|date=April 2018}} Historian Gayle Fischer mentions that Dr. Ellis also criticized Oneida women's clothing as \"healthful' uniforms did not rid Oneida women of their 'peculiar air of unhealthiness' \u2014 brought on by \"sexual excess.\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nNoyes responded to Ellis' criticism four years later in a pamphlet, ''Dixon and His Copytists'', where he claimed that Dr. John B. Ellis is a pseudonym for a \"literary gentleman living in the upper part of the city.\"{{sfn |Noyes |1871 |pp=37\u201339}} Noyes argued that AMS press employed the writer after they read a Philadelphia paper article on the community and saw a chance to profit off sensationalist writing.{{sfn |Noyes |1871 |pp=37\u201339}}{{Primary source inline|date=April 2018}}\n\n=== Tryphena Hubbard's legal battle ===\nIn Anthony Wonderly\u2019s ''Oneida Utopia'', he covers the 1848-1851 Hubbard affair as a moment where a legal conflict almost ended the group, who were only a mere \"Association\" at the time. Twenty-one year old Tryphena Hubbard learned Noyes\u2019 ideas about marriage and sex through his manuscript ''Bible Argument'' in 1848. She joined the community and became the group's first local convert. Tryphena Hubbard soon married Henry Seymour, a young man in the community.{{sfn |Wonderley |2017 |pp=72\u201374, 137}}\n\nEarly in 1849, Tryphena's father Noahdiah Hubbard learned of the Association's open marriages and demanded his daughter's return. Tryphena refused and for two years Noahdiah \"made a sulking nuisance of himself at the Mansion House.\"{{sfn |Wonderley |2017 |pp=72\u201374, 137}}\n\nAn 1850 criticism of Tryphena mentioned her \"insubordination to the church\" as well as \"excess egotism amounting to insanity.\"{{sfn |Wonderley |2017 |pp=72\u201374, 137}} There was marriage before the community attempted perfectionism and Tryphena's husband's supervision over her was increased along with the \"disciplinary norms of the day, physical punishment.\"{{sfn |Wonderley |2017 |pp=72\u201374, 137}} \n\nIn September 1851 Tryphena began displaying signs of mental illness, \"crying at night, speaking incoherently, and wandering around.\"  Seymour went to the Hubbard family to report their daughter's insanity and both parents were appalled by Seymour's physical violence.{{sfn |Wonderley |2017 |pp=72\u201374, 137}}\n\nOn September 27, 1851, Noahdiah Hubbard lodged assault and battery charges on behalf of his daughter.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=b2SnVuHWIJkC&pg=PR55&dq=Tryphena+Hubbard#v=onepage&q=Tryphena%20Hubbard&f=false|title=Free Love in Utopia: John Humphrey Noyes and the Origin of the Oneida Community|last=Noyes|first=George Wallingford|last2=Foster|first2=Lawrence|date=2001|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=9780252026706|language=en}}</ref>  Seymour was indicted and other community members were served arrest warrants as accessories.{{sfn |Wonderley |2017 |pp=72\u201374, 137}}  \n\nThe case was settled on November 26, 1851. The community agreed to Tryphena's expenses while she was in the asylum and after her release $125 a year if she was well and $200 a year if she remained unwell. The Hubbards eventually accepted a $350 settlement in lieu of long term payments. Tryphena Hubbard eventually returned to Henry Seymour and had a child by him. She died at the age of 49 in 1877.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Decline ==\nThe community lasted until John Humphrey Noyes attempted to pass leadership to his son, Theodore Noyes. This move was unsuccessful because Theodore was an [[agnostic]] and lacked his father's talent for leadership.<ref>Hillebrand, Randall (2003). [http://www.nyhistory.com/central/oneida.htm \"The Oneida Community\"], New York History Net.</ref> The move also divided the community, as Communitarian John Tower attempted to wrest control for himself.{{sfn |MacHovec |2010}}{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\nWithin the commune, there was a debate about when children should be initiated into sex, and by whom. There was also much debate about its practices as a whole. The founding members were aging or deceased, and many of the younger communitarians desired to enter into exclusive, traditional marriages.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Roach |first1=Monique Patenaude |date=June 2001 |title=The Loss of Religious Allegiance Among the Youth of the Oneida Community |journal=The Historian |volume=63 |issue=4 |pages=787\u2013806 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-6563.2001.tb01946.x |jstor=24450501}}</ref>\n\nThe capstone to all these pressures was the campaign by Professor John Mears of [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] against the community. He called for a protest meeting against the Oneida Community; it was attended by forty-seven clergymen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.syr.edu/digital/collections/o/OneidaCommunityCollectionInTheSyracuseUniversityLibrary/|title=The Oneida Community Collection in the Syracuse University Library|work=syr.edu|accessdate=October 3, 2016}}</ref> John Humphrey Noyes was informed by trusted adviser Myron Kinsley that a warrant for his arrest on charges of [[statutory rape]] was imminent. Noyes fled the Oneida Community Mansion House and the country in the middle of a June night in 1879, never to return to the United States. Shortly afterward, he wrote to his followers from [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]], recommending that the practice of complex marriage be abandoned.\n\nComplex marriage was abandoned in 1879 following external pressures and the community soon broke apart, with some of the members reorganizing as a [[joint stock company|joint-stock company]]. Marital partners normalized their status with the partners with whom they were cohabiting at the time of the re-organization. Over 70 Community members entered into a traditional marriage in the following year.\n\nDuring the early 20th century, the new company, [[Oneida Limited|Oneida Community Limited]], narrowed their focus to silverware. The animal trap business was sold in 1912, the silk business in 1916, and the canning discontinued as unprofitable in 1915.\n\nThe joint-stock corporation still exists and is a major producer of [[cutlery]] under the brand name \"Oneida Limited\". In September 2004 Oneida Limited announced that it would cease all U.S. manufacturing operations in the beginning of 2005, ending a 124-year tradition. The company continues to design and market products that are manufactured overseas.  The company has been selling off its manufacturing facilities. Most recently, the distribution center in [[Sherrill, New York]], was closed. Administrative offices remain in the Oneida area.\n\nThe last original member of the community, Ella Florence Underwood (1850\u20131950), died on June 25, 1950, in [[Kenwood, New York]], near [[Oneida, New York]].<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Upstate Centenarian is Dead |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1950/06/27/91106370.html |work=The New York Times |agency=Associated Press |page=29 |date=June 27, 1950 |url-access=subscription }}</ref><ref>[[Time (magazine)]]; July 3, 1950; Died.

Among those are: ''The Oneida Community: An Autobiography, 1851\u20131876'' and ''The Oneida Community: The Breakup, 1876\u20131881'', both by Constance Noyes Robertson; ''Desire and Duty at Oneida: Tirzah Miller's Intimate Memoir'' and ''Special Love/Special Sex: An Oneida Community Diary'', both by Robert S. Fogarty; ''Without Sin'' by Spencer Klaw; ''Oneida, From Free Love Utopia to the Well-Set Table'' by Ellen Wayland-Smith; and biographical/autobiographic accounts by once-members including Jessie Catherine Kinsley, Corinna Ackley Noyes, George Wallingford Noyes, and Pierrepont B. Noyes.\n\nAn account of the Oneida Community is found in [[Sarah Vowell]]'s book ''[[Assassination Vacation]]''. It discusses the community in general and the membership of [[Charles Guiteau]], for more than five years, in the community (Guiteau later assassinated President [[James A. Garfield]]).  The perfectionist community in [[David Flusfeder]]'s novel ''Pagan House'' (2007) is directly inspired by the Oneida Community. Oneida Community is given tribute at [[Twin Oaks Community|Twin Oaks]], a contemporary [[intentional community]] of 100 members in [[Virginia]]. All Twin Oaks' buildings are named after communities that are no longer actively functioning, and \"Oneida\" is the name of one of the residences.\n\nThe [[Oneida Community Mansion House]] was listed as a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1965, and the principal surviving material culture of the Oneida Community consists of those landmarked buildings, object collections, and landscape. The five buildings of the [[Oneida Community Mansion House|Mansion House]], separately designed by Erastus Hamilton, Lewis W. Leeds, and Theodore Skinner, comprise {{convert|93000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} on a 33-acre site. This site has been continuously occupied since the community's establishment in 1848 and the existing Mansion House has been occupied since 1862. Today, the [[Oneida Community Mansion House]] is a non-profit educational organization chartered by the State of New York and welcomes visitors throughout the year with guided tours, programs, and exhibits. It preserves, collects and interprets the intangible and material culture of the Oneida Community and of related themes of the 19th and 20th centuries. The Mansion House also houses residential apartments, overnight guest rooms, and meeting space.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Chmielewski|first=Wendy E.|date=2001|title=Review of Desire and Duty at Oneida: Tirzah Miller's Intimate Memoir|journal=Utopian Studies|volume=12|issue=1|pages=176\u2013178|jstor=20718260|oclc=5542766034 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=DeMaria |first=Richard |title=Communal Love at Oneida: A Perfectionist Vision of Authority, Property and Sexual Order |publisher=E.

The community believed that [[Jesus]] had already returned in AD 70, making it possible for them to bring about [[Millennialism|Jesus's millennial kingdom]] themselves, and be free of sin and perfect in this world, not just in [[Heaven]] (a belief called ''[[Christian perfection|perfectionism]]''). The Oneida Community practiced [[communalism]] (in the sense of communal property and possessions), [[complex marriage]], [[Coitus reservatus|male sexual continence]], and mutual criticism.  There were smaller Noyesian communities in [[Wallingford, Connecticut]]; [[Newark, New Jersey]]; [[Putney, Vermont|Putney]] and [[Cambridge, Vermont]].{{sfn |Chmielewski |2001 |pp=176\u2013178}} The community's original 87 members grew to 172 by February 1850, 208 by 1852, and 306 by 1878. The branches were closed in 1854 except for the Wallingford branch, which operated until devastated by a [[1878 Wallingford tornado|tornado]] in 1878. The Oneida Community dissolved in 1881, and eventually became the [[Cutlery|silverware]] company [[Oneida Limited]].{{sfn |Hays |1999}}\n\n== Community structure ==\nEven though the community only reached a maximum population of about 300, it had a complex bureaucracy of 27 standing committees and 48 administrative sections.{{sfn |MacHovec |2010}}{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe manufacturing of silverware, the sole remaining industry, began in 1877, relatively late in the life of the community, and still exists.{{sfn |Hays |1999}} Secondary industries included the manufacture of leather travel bags, the weaving of [[palm frond]] hats, the construction of rustic garden furniture, game traps, and tourism.\n\nAll community members were expected to work, each according to his or her abilities. Women tended to do many of the domestic duties.{{sfn |Kern |1981 |p=}}{{Page needed|date=March 2020}} Although more skilled jobs tended to remain with an individual member (the financial manager, for example, held his post throughout the life of the community), community members rotated through the more unskilled jobs, working in the house, the fields, or the various industries. As Oneida thrived, it began to hire outsiders to work in these positions as well. They were a major employer in the area, with approximately 200 employees by 1870.\n\n=== Complex marriage ===\nThe Oneida community strongly believed in a system of [[free love]] (a term which Noyes is credited with coining) which was known as complex marriage,{{sfn |Foster |1997 |p=}} where any member was free to have sex with any other who consented.{{sfn |Stoehr |1979 |p=}}{{page needed|date=April 2020}} Possessiveness and exclusive relationships were frowned upon.{{sfn |DeMaria |1978 |p=83}} Unlike 20th-century social movements such as the [[Sexual Revolution]] of the 1960s, the Oneidans did not seek consequence-free sex for pleasure, but believed that, because the natural outcome of intercourse was pregnancy, raising children should be a communal responsibility. Women over the age of 40 were to act as sexual \"mentors\" to adolescent boys, because these relationships had a minimal chance of conceiving. Furthermore, these women became religious role models for the young men. Likewise, older men often introduced young women to sex. Noyes often used his own judgment in determining the partnerships that would form, and he would often encourage relationships between the non-devout and the devout in the community, in the hope that the attitudes and behaviors of the devout would influence the attitudes of the non-devout.{{sfn |Noyes |1937 |p=}}{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn 1993, the archives of the community were made available to scholars for the first time. Contained within the archives was the journal of Tirzah Miller,{{sfn |Herrick |Fogarty |2000 |p=}} Noyes' niece, who wrote extensively about her romantic and sexual relations with other members of Oneida.{{sfn |Chmielewski |2001 |pp=176\u2013178}}\n\n=== Mutual criticism ===\nEvery member of the community was subject to criticism by committee or the community as a whole, during a general meeting.{{sfn |Noyes |Oneida Community |1876}} The goal was to eliminate undesirable character traits.<ref>Parker, Robert Allerton (1935).

Putnam's Sons, p. 215.</ref> Various contemporary sources contend that Noyes himself was the subject of criticism, although less often and of probably less severe criticism than the rest of the community. Charles Nordhoff said he had witnessed the criticism of a member he referred to as \"Charles\", writing the following account of the incident:\n\n{{quote|Charles sat speechless, looking before him; but as the accusations multiplied, his face grew paler, and drops of perspiration began to stand on his forehead. The remarks I have reported took up about half an hour; and now, each one in the circle having spoken, Mr. Noyes summed up. He said that Charles had some serious faults; that he had watched him with some care; and that he thought the young man was earnestly trying to cure himself. He spoke in general praise of his ability, his good character, and of certain temptations he had resisted in the course of his life. He thought he saw signs that Charles was making a real and earnest attempt to conquer his faults; and as one evidence of this, he remarked that Charles had lately come to him to consult him upon a difficult case in which he had had a severe struggle, but had in the end succeeded in doing right. \"In the course of what we call stirpiculture\", said Noyes, \"Charles, as you know, is in the situation of one who is by and by to become a father. Under these circumstances, he has fallen under the too common temptation of selfish love, and a desire to wait upon and cultivate an exclusive intimacy with the woman who was to bear a child through him. This is an insidious temptation, very apt to attack people under such circumstances; but it must nevertheless be struggled against.\" Charles, he went on to say, had come to him for advice in this case, and he (Noyes) had at first refused to tell him any thing, but had asked him what he thought he ought to do; that after some conversation, Charles had determined, and he agreed with him, that he ought to isolate himself entirely from the woman, and let another man take his place at her side; and this Charles had accordingly done, with a most praiseworthy spirit of selfsacrifice. Charles had indeed still further taken up his cross, as he had noticed with pleasure, by going to sleep with the smaller children, to take charge of them during the night. Taking all this in view, he thought Charles was in a fair way to become a better man, and had manifested a sincere desire to improve, and to rid himself of all selfish faults.{{sfn |Nordhoff |1875 |pp=[https://archive.org/stream/communisticsoci00nord#page/292/mode/2up 292&ndash;293]}}}}\n\n=== Male continence ===\nTo control reproduction within the Oneida community, a system of male continence or [[coitus reservatus]] was enacted.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sandeen |first1=Ernest R. |title=John Humphrey Noyes as the New Adam |journal=Church History |date=March 1971 |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=82\u201390 |doi=10.2307/3163109 |jstor=3163109}}</ref> John Humprey Noyes decided that sexual intercourse served two distinct purposes. In ''Male Continence'', Noyes argues that the method simply \"proposes the subordination of the flesh to the spirit, teaching men to seek principally the elevated spiritual pleasures of sexual connection\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://library.syr.edu/digital/collections/m/MaleContinence-51k/|title=Male Continence|last=Noyes|first=John|publisher=Oneida Community|year=1872|isbn=|location=Syracuse Library|page=13}}</ref> The primary purpose of male continence was social satisfaction, \"to allow the sexes to communicate and express affection for one another\".<ref name=\"van-wormer\">{{cite journal |last1=Van Wormer |first1=Heather M. |title=The Ties That Bind: Ideology, Material Culture, and the Utopian Ideal |journal=Historical Archaeology |date=March 2006 |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=37\u201356 |doi=10.1007/BF03376714 |jstor=25617315}}</ref> The second purpose was procreation. Of around two hundred adults using male continence as birth control, there were twelve unplanned births within Oneida between 1848 and 1868,<ref name=\"van-wormer\" /> indicating that it was a highly effective form of birth control.{{sfn |Foster |1986}}{{rp|18}} Young men were introduced to male continence by women who were post-menopause, and young women were introduced by experienced, older males.{{sfn |Foster |1986}}{{rp|18\u201319}}\n\nNoyes believed that ejaculation \"drained men's vitality and led to disease\"{{sfn |Mandelker |1982 |pp=742\u20133}} and pregnancy and childbirth \"levied a heavy tax on the vitality of women\".{{sfn |Mandelker |1982 |pp=742\u20133}} Noyes founded male continence to spare his wife, Harriet, from more difficult childbirths after five traumatizing births of which four led to the death of the child.{{sfn |Foster |1986}}{{rp|17}} They favored this method of male continence over other methods of birth control because they found it to be natural, healthy and favorable for the development of intimate relationships.{{sfn |Mandelker |1982 |p=743}} Women found increased sexual satisfaction in the practice, and Oneida is regarded as highly unusual in the value they placed on women's sexual satisfaction.{{sfn |Foster |1986}}{{rp|19}} If a male failed he faced public disapproval or private rejection.{{sfn |Mandelker |1982 |p=743}}\n\nIt is unclear whether the practice of male continence led to significant problems. Sociologist Lawrence Foster sees hints in Noyes' letters indicating that masturbation and anti-social withdrawal from community life may have been issues.{{sfn |Foster |1986}}{{rp|19}} Oneida's practice of male continence did not lead to [[impotence]].{{sfn |Foster |1986}}{{rp|18}}\n\n=== Stirpiculture ===\n{{Main|Oneida stirpiculture}}\nStirpiculture was a proto-eugenics program of selective controlled reproduction within the Community devised by Noyes and implemented in 1869.<ref name=\"Q41713204\">{{Cite Q|Q41713204|jstor=658471}}</ref><ref name=\"Q41714157\">{{Cite Q|Q41714157|location=Weston |publisher=M & S Press|isbn=9780877300090}}</ref><ref>[http://www.cis.yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/1989/1/89.01.04.x.html Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute, ''Utopian Communities, 1800\u20131890''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905044850/http://www.cis.yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/1989/1/89.01.04.x.html |date=September 5, 2006 }}</ref> It was designed to create more spiritually and physically perfect children.<ref>Richards, Martin (2004). \"Perfecting People: Selective Breeding at the Oneida Community (1869\u20131879) and the Eugenics Movement\", ''New Genetics and Society'' '''23''' (1), pp. 47\u201371.</ref> Community members who wished to be parents would go before a committee to be approved and matched based on their spiritual and moral qualities. 53 women and 38 men participated in this program, which necessitated the construction of a new wing of the Oneida Community Mansion House.

Some of these privileges included not having to care for their own children as Oneida had a communal child care system, as well as freedom from unwanted pregnancies with Oneida's [[Coitus reservatus|male continence]] practice. In addition, they were able to wear functional, [[Bloomers (clothing)|Bloomer]]-style clothing and maintain short haircuts. Women were able to participate in practically all types of community work.{{sfn |Foster |1991 |pp=[https://archive.org/details/womenfamilyutopi0000fost/page/91 91\u2013102]}}  While domestic duties remained a primarily female responsibility, women were free to explore positions in business and sales, or as artisans or craftsmen, and many did so, particularly in the late 1860s and early 1870s.{{sfn |Kern |1981 |p=260}} Last, women had an active role in shaping commune policy, participating in the daily religious and business meetings.{{sfn |Foster |1991 |pp=[https://archive.org/details/womenfamilyutopi0000fost/page/91 91\u2013102]}}\n\nThe [[Group marriage|complex marriage]] and free love systems practiced at Oneida further acknowledged female status. Through the complex marriage arrangement, women and men had equal freedom in sexual expression and commitment.{{sfn |Foster |1991 |pp=[https://archive.org/details/womenfamilyutopi0000fost/page/91 91\u2013102]}} Indeed, sexual practices at Oneida accepted female sexuality. A woman's right to satisfying sexual experiences was recognized, and women were encouraged to have orgasms.{{sfn |Kern |1981 |pp=224, 232}} However, a woman's right of refusing a sexual overture was limited depending on the status of the man who made the advance.{{sfn |Kern |1981 |p=241}}\n\nEllen Wayland-Smith, author of \"The Status and Self-Perception of Women in the Oneida Community\", said that men and women had roughly equal status in the community. She points out that while both sexes were ultimately subject to Noyes' vision and will, women did not suffer any undue oppression.{{sfn |Wayland-Smith |1988 |p=49}}\n\n== Interactions with wider society ==\nThe community experienced freedom from wider society. The previously mentioned unorthodox marital, sexual, and religious practices caused them to face some criticism. However, between the community's beginning in the 1850s until the 1870s, their interactions with wider society were mostly favorable. These are the best known instances of conflict and peace resolution.\n\n=== Outsider criticism ===\nIn 1870, a \"nineteenth century cultural critic\" Dr. John B. Ellis wrote a book against Free Love communities that Noyes inspired, including \"[[Anarchism|Individual Sovereigns]], [[Berlin Heights, Ohio|Berlin Heights]] Free Lovers, [[Spiritualists]], [[Women's suffrage in the United States|Advocates of Woman Suffrage]], or Friends of [[Divorce in the United States#19th century|Free Divorce]]\".{{sfn |Ellis |1870 ||pp=10\u201313}}<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Pantaloons in Private Health and Religious Dress Reform before Freedom Dresses|last=Fischer|first=Gayle|publisher=The Kent State University Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0873386821|location=Ohio|pages=[https://archive.org/details/pantaloonspowern0000fisc/page/58 58]|url=https://archive.org/details/pantaloonspowern0000fisc/page/58}}</ref> He saw their joint goal to be ending marriage.

Twenty-one year old Tryphena Hubbard learned Noyes\u2019 ideas about marriage and sex through his manuscript ''Bible Argument'' in 1848. She joined the community and became the group's first local convert. Tryphena Hubbard soon married Henry Seymour, a young man in the community.{{sfn |Wonderley |2017 |pp=72\u201374, 137}}\n\nEarly in 1849, Tryphena's father Noahdiah Hubbard learned of the Association's open marriages and demanded his daughter's return.

The community agreed to Tryphena's expenses while she was in the asylum and after her release $125 a year if she was well and $200 a year if she remained unwell. The Hubbards eventually accepted a $350 settlement in lieu of long term payments. Tryphena Hubbard eventually returned to Henry Seymour and had a child by him. She died at the age of 49 in 1877.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Decline ==\nThe community lasted until John Humphrey Noyes attempted to pass leadership to his son, Theodore Noyes.

[http://www.nyhistory.com/central/oneida.htm \"The Oneida Community\"], New York History Net.</ref> The move also divided the community, as Communitarian John Tower attempted to wrest control for himself.{{sfn |MacHovec |2010}}{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\nWithin the commune, there was a debate about when children should be initiated into sex, and by whom. There was also much debate about its practices as a whole. The founding members were aging or deceased, and many of the younger communitarians desired to enter into exclusive, traditional marriages.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Roach |first1=Monique Patenaude |date=June 2001 |title=The Loss of Religious Allegiance Among the Youth of the Oneida Community |journal=The Historian |volume=63 |issue=4 |pages=787\u2013806 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-6563.2001.tb01946.x |jstor=24450501}}</ref>\n\nThe capstone to all these pressures was the campaign by Professor John Mears of [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] against the community.

Noyes fled the Oneida Community Mansion House and the country in the middle of a June night in 1879, never to return to the United States. Shortly afterward, he wrote to his followers from [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]], recommending that the practice of complex marriage be abandoned.\n\nComplex marriage was abandoned in 1879 following external pressures and the community soon broke apart, with some of the members reorganizing as a [[joint stock company|joint-stock company]]. Marital partners normalized their status with the partners with whom they were cohabiting at the time of the re-organization. Over 70 Community members entered into a traditional marriage in the following year.\n\nDuring the early 20th century, the new company, [[Oneida Limited|Oneida Community Limited]], narrowed their focus to silverware. The animal trap business was sold in 1912, the silk business in 1916, and the canning discontinued as unprofitable in 1915.\n\nThe joint-stock corporation still exists and is a major producer of [[cutlery]] under the brand name \"Oneida Limited\". In September 2004 Oneida Limited announced that it would cease all U.S. manufacturing operations in the beginning of 2005, ending a 124-year tradition. The company continues to design and market products that are manufactured overseas.  The company has been selling off its manufacturing facilities.

Among those are: ''The Oneida Community: An Autobiography, 1851\u20131876'' and ''The Oneida Community: The Breakup, 1876\u20131881'', both by Constance Noyes Robertson; ''Desire and Duty at Oneida: Tirzah Miller's Intimate Memoir'' and ''Special Love/Special Sex: An Oneida Community Diary'', both by Robert S. Fogarty; ''Without Sin'' by Spencer Klaw; ''Oneida, From Free Love Utopia to the Well-Set Table'' by Ellen Wayland-Smith; and biographical/autobiographic accounts by once-members including Jessie Catherine Kinsley, Corinna Ackley Noyes, George Wallingford Noyes, and Pierrepont B. Noyes.\n\nAn account of the Oneida Community is found in [[Sarah Vowell]]'s book ''[[Assassination Vacation]]''. It discusses the community in general and the membership of [[Charles Guiteau]], for more than five years, in the community (Guiteau later assassinated President [[James A. Garfield]]).  The perfectionist community in [[David Flusfeder]]'s novel ''Pagan House'' (2007) is directly inspired by the Oneida Community. Oneida Community is given tribute at [[Twin Oaks Community|Twin Oaks]], a contemporary [[intentional community]] of 100 members in [[Virginia]]. All Twin Oaks' buildings are named after communities that are no longer actively functioning, and \"Oneida\" is the name of one of the residences.\n\nThe [[Oneida Community Mansion House]] was listed as a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1965, and the principal surviving material culture of the Oneida Community consists of those landmarked buildings, object collections, and landscape. The five buildings of the [[Oneida Community Mansion House|Mansion House]], separately designed by Erastus Hamilton, Lewis W. Leeds, and Theodore Skinner, comprise {{convert|93000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} on a 33-acre site. This site has been continuously occupied since the community's establishment in 1848 and the existing Mansion House has been occupied since 1862. Today, the [[Oneida Community Mansion House]] is a non-profit educational organization chartered by the State of New York and welcomes visitors throughout the year with guided tours, programs, and exhibits. It preserves, collects and interprets the intangible and material culture of the Oneida Community and of related themes of the 19th and 20th centuries. The Mansion House also houses residential apartments, overnight guest rooms, and meeting space.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Chmielewski|first=Wendy E.|date=2001|title=Review of Desire and Duty at Oneida: Tirzah Miller's Intimate Memoir|journal=Utopian Studies|volume=12|issue=1|pages=176\u2013178|jstor=20718260|oclc=5542766034 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=DeMaria |first=Richard |title=Communal Love at Oneida: A Perfectionist Vision of Authority, Property and Sexual Order |publisher=E.

Franklin chose the data rich \"A\" form while Wilkins selected the \"B\" form<ref name=\"Maddox 155\"/><ref name=\"Wilkins, p. 158\">Wilkins, p. 158.</ref> because, according to his self-written biography, Wilkins' preliminary pictures had hinted it might be [[helix|helical]].

Her two A-DNA manuscripts reached ''[[Acta Crystallographica]]'' in [[Copenhagen]] on 6 March 1953, one day before Crick and Watson had completed their model on B-DNA. She must have mailed them while the Cambridge team was building their model, and certainly had written them before she knew of their work.<ref name=\"Maddox 199\">Maddox, p. 199.</ref> On 8 July 1953 she modified one of these \"in proof\" ''Acta'' articles, \"in light of recent work\" by the King's and Cambridge research teams.<ref>Franklin and Gosling (1953).

Since Wilkins was not in his office, Watson went to Franklin's lab with his urgent message that they should all collaborate before Pauling discovered his error. The unimpressed Franklin became angry when Watson suggested she did not know how to interpret her own data. Watson hastily retreated, backing into Wilkins who had been attracted by the commotion. Wilkins commiserated with his harried friend and then showed Watson Franklin's DNA X-ray image.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hubbard |first1=Ruth |title=Women, Science, and Technology |date=2013 |publisher=Taylor and Francis |location=Hoboken |isbn=978-1-135-05542-4 |page=269 |edition=3rd |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=unO_AAAAQBAJ&lpg=PA269&dq=Wilkins%20Watson%20Franklin%20X-ray&pg=PA269#v=onepage&q&f=false |chapter=Science, Power, Gender: How DNA Became the Book of Life}}</ref> Watson, in turn, showed Wilkins a prepublication manuscript by Pauling and Corey, which contained a DNA structure remarkably like their first incorrect model.<ref>Yockey, pp. 9\u201310.</ref>\n\n====DNA research====\nIn February 1953, [[James Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] of the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] in [[Cambridge University]] had started to build a [[molecular model]] of the B form of DNA using data similar to that available to both teams at King's. Much of their data was derived directly from research done at King's by Wilkins and Franklin. Franklin's research was completed by February 1953, ahead of her move to Birkbeck, and her data was critical.<ref>Crick's 31 December 1961 letter to Jacque Monod cited above.</ref> Model building had been applied successfully in the elucidation of the structure of the [[alpha helix]] by Linus Pauling in 1951,<ref name=\"Wilkins, p. 158\" /><ref>Maddox, p. 147.</ref> but Franklin was opposed to prematurely building theoretical models, until sufficient data were obtained to properly guide the model building. She took the view that building a model was to be undertaken only after enough of the structure was known.<ref name=\"Wilkins, p. 176\" /><ref>Maddox, p. 161.</ref>\n\nEver cautious, she wanted to eliminate misleading possibilities. Photographs of her Birkbeck work table show that she routinely used small molecular models, although certainly not ones on the grand scale successfully used at Cambridge for DNA. In the middle of February 1953, Crick's thesis advisor, [[Max Perutz]], gave Crick a copy of a report written for a [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council]] biophysics committee visit to King's in December 1952, containing many of Franklin's crystallographic calculations.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hubbard |first=Ruth |title=The Politics of Women's Biology |date=1990 |publisher=Rutgers State University |isbn=0-8135-1490-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/politicsofwomens00hubb/page/60 60] |url=https://archive.org/details/politicsofwomens00hubb/page/60 }}</ref>\n\nSince Franklin had decided to transfer to Birkbeck College and Randall had insisted that all DNA work must stay at King's, Wilkins was given copies of Franklin's diffraction photographs by Gosling. By 28 February 1953, Watson and Crick felt they had solved the problem enough for Crick to proclaim (in the local pub) that they had \"found the secret of life\".<ref>\"The Double Helix\", p. 115.</ref> However, they knew they must complete their model before they could be certain.<ref>\"The Double Helix\", p. 60.</ref>\n\nWatson and Crick finished building their model on 7 March 1953, one day before they received a letter from Wilkins stating that Franklin was finally leaving and they could put \"all hands to the pump\".<ref>\"All hands to the pump\" letter is preserved in the Crick archives at the University of California, San Diego, and was posted as part of their Web collection. It is also quoted by both Maddox, p 204, and Olby.</ref> This was also one day after Franklin's two A-DNA papers had reached ''Acta Crystallographica''. Wilkins came to see the model the following week, according to Franklin's biographer [[Brenda Maddox]] on 12 March, and allegedly informed Gosling on his return to King's.<ref name=\"Maddox 207\">Maddox, p. 207.</ref>\n\nIt is uncertain how long it took for Gosling to inform Franklin at Birkbeck, but her original 17 March B-DNA manuscript does not reflect any knowledge of the Cambridge model. Franklin did modify this draft later before publishing it as the third in the trio of 25 April 1953 ''Nature'' articles. On 18 March,<ref>In contrast to his other letters to Crick, Wilkins dated this one.</ref> in response to receiving a copy of their preliminary manuscript, Wilkins penned the following: \"I think you're a couple of old rogues, but you may well have something\".<ref>\"Old rogues\" letter is preserved in the Crick archives at the University of California at San Diego, and was posted as part of their web collection. It is also quoted by both Maddox, p. 208, and Olby.</ref>\n\nWeeks later, on 10 April, Franklin wrote to Crick for permission to see their model.<ref>10 April 1953 Franklin postcard to Crick asking permission to view model. The original is in the Crick archives at the University of California, San Diego.</ref> Franklin retained her scepticism for premature model building even after seeing the Watson\u2013Crick model, and remained unimpressed. She is reported to have commented, \"It's very pretty, but how are they going to prove it?\" As an experimental scientist, Franklin seems to have been interested in producing far greater evidence before publishing-as-proven a proposed model. As such, her response to the Watson\u2013Crick model was in keeping with her cautious approach to science.<ref>Holt, J. (2002).</ref>\n\nCrick and Watson then published their model in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' on 25 April 1953 in an article describing the double-helical structure of DNA with only a footnote acknowledging \"having been stimulated by a general knowledge of\" Franklin and Wilkins' \"unpublished\" contribution.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite journal |authors=Watson, J.

She obtained Bernal's consent in July 1957, though serious concerns were raised after she disclosed her intentions to research live, instead of killed, polio virus at Birkbeck. Eventually, Bernal arranged for the virus to be safely stored at the [[London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine]] during the group's research. With her group, Franklin then commenced deciphering the structure of the polio virus while it was in a crystalline state. She attempted to mount the virus crystals in capillary tubes for X-ray studies, but was forced to end her work due to her rapidly failing health.<ref>Brown, p. 359.</ref>\n\nAfter Franklin's death, [[Aaron Klug|Klug]] succeeded her as group leader, and he, Finch and Holmes continued researching the structure of the polio virus. They eventually succeeded in obtaining extremely detailed X-ray images of the virus. In June 1959, Klug and Finch published the group's findings, revealing the polio virus to have icosahedral symmetry, and in the same paper suggested the possibility for all spherical viruses to possess the same symmetry, as it permitted the greatest possible number (60) of identical structural units.<ref>Brown, pp. 360\u2013361.</ref> The team moved to the [[Laboratory of Molecular Biology]], Cambridge in 1962,<ref>Glynn, p. 153.</ref> and the old Torrington Square laboratories were demolished four years later, in May 1966.<ref>Brown, p. 466.</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nFranklin was best described as an [[agnostic]]. Her lack of religious faith apparently did not stem from anyone's influence, rather from her own line of thinking. She developed her scepticism as a young child. Her mother recalled that she refused to believe in the [[existence of God]], and remarked, \"Well, anyhow, how do you know He isn't She?\"<ref>Glynn, p. 12.</ref> She later made her position clear, now based on her scientific experience, and wrote to her father in 1940:\n{{quote|[S]cience and everyday life cannot and should not be separated. Science, for me, gives a partial explanation of life&nbsp;... I do not accept your definition of faith i.e. belief in life after death&nbsp;...

As the only Jewish student at Lindores School, she had Hebrew lessons on her own while her friends went to church.<ref>Glynn, p. 19.</ref> She joined the Jewish Society while in her first term at Newnham College, Cambridge, out of respect of her grandfather's request.<ref>Glynn, p. 44.</ref> Franklin confided to her sister that she was \"always consciously a Jew\".<ref name=\"Maddox, p. 61\"/>\n\nFranklin loved travelling abroad, particularly [[trekking]]. She first \"qualified\" at Christmas 1929 for a vacation at [[Menton]], France, where her grandfather went to escape English winter.<ref>Glynn, p. 16.</ref> Her family frequently spent vacations in Wales or Cornwall. A trip to France in 1938 gave her a lasting love for France and its language. She considered the French lifestyle at that time as \"vastly superior to that of English\".<ref name=\"Polcovar, p. 33\">Polcovar, p. 33.</ref> In contrast, she described English people as having \"vacant stupid faces and childlike complacency\".<ref>Polcovar, p. 59.</ref> Her family was almost stuck in Norway in 1939, as World War II was declared on their way home.<ref>Glynn, p. 33.</ref> In another instance, she trekked the French Alps with Jean Kerslake in 1946, which almost cost her her life. She slipped off on a slope, and was barely rescued.<ref>Glynn, p. 79.</ref> But she wrote to her mother, \"I am quite sure I could wander happily in France forever. I love the people, the country and the food.\"<ref name=\"Polcovar, p. 41\">Polcovar, p. 41.</ref>\n\nShe made several professional trips to US, and was particularly jovial among her American friends and constantly displayed her sense of humour. William Ginoza of the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] later recalled that she was the opposite of Watson's description of her, and as Maddox comments, Americans enjoyed her \"sunny side\".<ref>Maddox, p. 277.</ref>\n\nIn his book ''The Double Helix,'' Watson provides his first-person account of the search for and discovery of DNA. He paints a sympathetic but sometimes critical portrait of Franklin. He praises her intellect and scientific acumen, but portrays her as difficult to work with and careless with her appearance. After introducing her in the book as \"Rosalind,\" he writes that he and his male colleagues usually referred to her as \"Rosy\", the name people at King's College London used behind her back.<ref>Watson, p. 16.</ref> She did not want to be called by that name because she had a great-aunt Rosy. In the family, she was called \"Ros\".<ref>Glynn, p. 157.</ref> To others, she was simply \"Rosalind\". She made it clear to an American visiting friend Dorothea Raacke, while sitting with her at Crick's table in [[The Eagle, Cambridge|The Eagle]] pub in Cambridge: Raacke asked her how she was to be called and she replied \"I'm afraid it will have to be Rosalind\", adding \"Most definitely not ''Rosy''.\"<ref name=\"Maddox, p. 288\">Maddox, p. 288.</ref>\n\nShe often expressed her political views. She initially blamed [[Winston Churchill]] for inciting the war, but later admired him for his speeches. She actively supported Professor [[John Ryle (physician)|John Ryle]] as an independent candidate for parliament in 1940, but he was unsuccessful.<ref name=\"Glynn, p. 52\">Glynn, p. 52.</ref>\n\nShe did not seem to have an intimate relationship with anyone, and always kept her deepest personal feelings to herself. After her younger days, she avoided close friendship with the opposite sex. In her later years, Evi Ellis, who had shared her bedroom when a child refugee and who was then married to Ernst Wohlgemuth<ref name=genealogy/> and had moved to Notting Hill from Chicago, tried matchmaking her with [[Ralph Miliband]] but failed. Franklin once told Evi that her flatmate asked her for a drink, but she did not understand the intention.<ref>Maddox, p. 261.</ref> She was quite infatuated by her French mentor Mering, who had a wife and a mistress.<ref name=\"Polcovar, p. 41\"/> Mering also admitted that he was captivated by her \"intelligence and beauty\".<ref>Polcovar, p. 51.</ref> According to [[Anne Sayre]], Franklin did confess her feeling for Mering when she was undergoing surgery, but her family denied this{{when|date=February 2020}}.

In 1956, she visited him at his home in Colorado after her tour to [[University of California, Berkeley]], and she was known to remark later that Caspar was one \"she might have loved, might have married\". In her letter to Sayre, she described him as \"an ideal match\".<ref>Maddox, p. 283.</ref>\n\n===Illness and death===\nIn mid-1956, while on a work-related trip to the United States, Franklin first began to suspect a health problem. While in New York she found difficulty in zipping her skirt; her stomach had bulged. Back in London she consulted Mair Livingstone, who asked her, \"You're not pregnant?\" to which she retorted, \"I wish I were.\" Her case was marked \"URGENT\".<ref>Maddox, p. 284.</ref> An operation on 4 September of the same year revealed two tumours in her abdomen.<ref>Maddox, p. 285.</ref> After this period and other periods of hospitalization, Franklin spent time convalescing with various friends and family members. These included Anne Sayre, Francis Crick, his wife Odile, with whom Franklin had formed a strong friendship,<ref name=\"Maddox, p. 288\"/> and finally with the Roland and Nina Franklin family where Rosalind's nieces and nephews bolstered her spirits.\n\nFranklin chose not to stay with her parents because her mother's uncontrollable grief and crying upset her too much. Even while undergoing cancer treatment, Franklin continued to work, and her group continued to produce results \u2013 seven papers in 1956 and six more in 1957.<ref>Maddox, p. 292.</ref> At the end of 1957, Franklin again fell ill and she was admitted to the [[Royal Marsden Hospital]]. On 2 December, she made her will. She named her three brothers as executors and made her colleague Aaron Klug the principal beneficiary, who would receive \u00a33,000 and her Austin car. Her other friends Mair Livingstone would get \u00a32,000, Anne Piper \u00a31,000, and her nurse Miss Griffith \u00a3250. The remainder of the estate was to be used for charities.<ref>Maddox, p. 301.</ref>\n\nShe returned to work in January 1958, and she was given a promotion to Research Associate in Biophysics on 25 February.<ref>Maddox, p. 302.</ref> She fell ill again on 30 March, and she died on 16 April 1958, in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], London,<ref>GRO Register of Deaths: JUN 1958 5c 257 CHELSEA \u2013 Rosalind E.

She also specified the amount of water to be found in the molecule in accordance with other parts of it, data that have considerable importance in terms of the stability of the molecule. Franklin was the first to discover and formulate these facts, which in fact constituted the basis for all later attempts to build a model of the molecule. However, Watson, at the time ignorant of the chemistry, failed to comprehend the crucial information, and this led to construction of a wrong model.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Everson |first1=Ted |title=The Gene: A Historical Perspective |year=2007 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Connecticut |isbn=978-0-313-33449-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/genehistoricalpe0000ever/page/85 85] |url=https://archive.org/details/genehistoricalpe0000ever|url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\nThe other contribution included an X-ray photograph of B-DNA (called ''[[Photo 51]]'')<ref>Maddox, pp. 177\u2013178.</ref> taken by Franklin's student Gosling that was briefly shown to Watson by Wilkins in January 1953,<ref name=\"Maddox, p. 196\">Maddox, p. 196.</ref><ref>Crick (1988), p. 67.</ref> and a report written for an MRC biophysics committee visit to King's in December 1952 which was shown by Perutz at the Cavendish Laboratory to both Crick and Watson.

A preliminary version of much of the important material contained in the 1952 December MRC report had been presented by Franklin in a talk she had given in November 1951, which Watson had attended but not understood.<ref name=\"Maddox 199\"/><ref>Watson (1969).</ref>\n\nThe Perutz letter was as said one of three letters, published with letters by Wilkins and Watson, which discussed their various contributions. Watson clarified the importance of the data obtained from the MRC report as he had not recorded these data while attending Franklin's lecture in 1951. The upshot of all this was that when Crick and Watson started to build their model in February 1953 they were working with critical parameters that had been determined by Franklin in 1951, and which she and Gosling had significantly refined in 1952, as well as with published data and other very similar data to those available at King's. It was generally believed that Franklin was never aware that her work had been used during construction of the model,<ref>Maddox, p. 316.</ref> but Gosling asserted in his 2013 interview that, \"Yes. Oh, she did know about that.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Attar |first1=N |title=Raymond Gosling: the man who crystallized genes |journal=Genome Biology |year=2013 |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=402 |doi=10.1186/gb-2013-14-4-402|pmid=23651528 |pmc=3663117}}</ref>\n\n====Recognition of her contribution to the model of DNA====\nUpon the completion of their model, Crick and Watson had invited Wilkins to be a co-author of their paper describing the structure.<ref>Wilkins, p. 213.</ref> Wilkins turned down this offer, as he had taken no part in building the model.<ref>Wilkins, p. 214.</ref> He later expressed regret that greater discussion of co-authorship had not taken place as this might have helped to clarify the contribution the work at King's had made to the discovery.<ref>Wilkins, p. 226.</ref> There is no doubt that Franklin's experimental data were used by Crick and Watson to build their model of DNA in 1953. Some, including Maddox, have explained this citation omission by suggesting that it may be a question of circumstance, because it would have been very difficult to cite the unpublished work from the MRC report they had seen.<ref name=\"Maddox 207\"/>\n\nIndeed, a clear timely acknowledgment would have been awkward, given the unorthodox manner in which data were transferred from King's to Cambridge. However, methods were available. Watson and Crick could have cited the MRC report as a personal communication or else cited the ''Acta ''articles in press, or most easily, the third ''Nature'' paper that they knew was in press. One of the most important accomplishments of Maddox's widely acclaimed biography is that Maddox made a well-received case for inadequate acknowledgement. \"Such acknowledgement as they gave her was very muted and always coupled with the name of Wilkins\".<ref>Maddox, pp. 316\u2013317, and other parts of the epilogue.</ref>\n\nFifteen years after the fact, the first clear recitation of Franklin's contribution appeared as it permeated Watson's account, ''The Double Helix'', although it was buried under descriptions of Watson's (often quite negative) regard towards Franklin during the period of their work on DNA. This attitude is epitomized in the confrontation between Watson and Franklin over a preprint of Pauling's mistaken DNA manuscript.<ref>Watson, J.D. (1968), pp. 95\u201396.</ref> Watson's words impelled Sayre to write her rebuttal, in which the entire chapter nine, \"Winner Take All\" has the structure of a legal brief dissecting and analyzing the topic of acknowledgement.<ref>Sayre, A. (1975), pp. 156\u2013167.</ref>\n\nSayre's early analysis was often ignored because of perceived feminist overtones in her book. Watson and Crick did not cite the X-ray diffraction work of Wilkins and Franklin in their original paper, though they admit having \"been stimulated by a knowledge of the general nature of the unpublished experimental results and ideas of Dr. M. H. F. Wilkins, Dr. R. E. Franklin and their co-workers at King's College London\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> In fact, Watson and Crick cited no experimental data at all in support of their model. Franklin and Gosling's publication of the DNA X-ray image, in the same issue of ''Nature'', served as the principal evidence:\n{{quote|\"Thus our general ideas are not inconsistent with the model proposed by Watson and Crick in the preceding communication\".<ref name=\"FG\">{{cite journal |last1=Franklin |first1=Rosalind E. |authorlink1=Rosalind Franklin |last2=Gosling |first2=R.

Her two A-DNA manuscripts reached ''[[Acta Crystallographica]]'' in [[Copenhagen]] on 6 March 1953, one day before Crick and Watson had completed their model on B-DNA.

Since Wilkins was not in his office, Watson went to Franklin's lab with his urgent message that they should all collaborate before Pauling discovered his error. The unimpressed Franklin became angry when Watson suggested she did not know how to interpret her own data. Watson hastily retreated, backing into Wilkins who had been attracted by the commotion. Wilkins commiserated with his harried friend and then showed Watson Franklin's DNA X-ray image.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hubbard |first1=Ruth |title=Women, Science, and Technology |date=2013 |publisher=Taylor and Francis |location=Hoboken |isbn=978-1-135-05542-4 |page=269 |edition=3rd |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=unO_AAAAQBAJ&lpg=PA269&dq=Wilkins%20Watson%20Franklin%20X-ray&pg=PA269#v=onepage&q&f=false |chapter=Science, Power, Gender: How DNA Became the Book of Life}}</ref> Watson, in turn, showed Wilkins a prepublication manuscript by Pauling and Corey, which contained a DNA structure remarkably like their first incorrect model.<ref>Yockey, pp. 9\u201310.</ref>\n\n====DNA research====\nIn February 1953, [[James Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] of the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] in [[Cambridge University]] had started to build a [[molecular model]] of the B form of DNA using data similar to that available to both teams at King's. Much of their data was derived directly from research done at King's by Wilkins and Franklin. Franklin's research was completed by February 1953, ahead of her move to Birkbeck, and her data was critical.<ref>Crick's 31 December 1961 letter to Jacque Monod cited above.</ref> Model building had been applied successfully in the elucidation of the structure of the [[alpha helix]] by Linus Pauling in 1951,<ref name=\"Wilkins, p. 158\" /><ref>Maddox, p. 147.</ref> but Franklin was opposed to prematurely building theoretical models, until sufficient data were obtained to properly guide the model building. She took the view that building a model was to be undertaken only after enough of the structure was known.<ref name=\"Wilkins, p. 176\" /><ref>Maddox, p. 161.</ref>\n\nEver cautious, she wanted to eliminate misleading possibilities. Photographs of her Birkbeck work table show that she routinely used small molecular models, although certainly not ones on the grand scale successfully used at Cambridge for DNA. In the middle of February 1953, Crick's thesis advisor, [[Max Perutz]], gave Crick a copy of a report written for a [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council]] biophysics committee visit to King's in December 1952, containing many of Franklin's crystallographic calculations.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hubbard |first=Ruth |title=The Politics of Women's Biology |date=1990 |publisher=Rutgers State University |isbn=0-8135-1490-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/politicsofwomens00hubb/page/60 60] |url=https://archive.org/details/politicsofwomens00hubb/page/60 }}</ref>\n\nSince Franklin had decided to transfer to Birkbeck College and Randall had insisted that all DNA work must stay at King's, Wilkins was given copies of Franklin's diffraction photographs by Gosling. By 28 February 1953, Watson and Crick felt they had solved the problem enough for Crick to proclaim (in the local pub) that they had \"found the secret of life\".<ref>\"The Double Helix\", p. 115.</ref> However, they knew they must complete their model before they could be certain.<ref>\"The Double Helix\", p. 60.</ref>\n\nWatson and Crick finished building their model on 7 March 1953, one day before they received a letter from Wilkins stating that Franklin was finally leaving and they could put \"all hands to the pump\".<ref>\"All hands to the pump\" letter is preserved in the Crick archives at the University of California, San Diego, and was posted as part of their Web collection. It is also quoted by both Maddox, p 204, and Olby.</ref> This was also one day after Franklin's two A-DNA papers had reached ''Acta Crystallographica''. Wilkins came to see the model the following week, according to Franklin's biographer [[Brenda Maddox]] on 12 March, and allegedly informed Gosling on his return to King's.<ref name=\"Maddox 207\">Maddox, p. 207.</ref>\n\nIt is uncertain how long it took for Gosling to inform Franklin at Birkbeck, but her original 17 March B-DNA manuscript does not reflect any knowledge of the Cambridge model. Franklin did modify this draft later before publishing it as the third in the trio of 25 April 1953 ''Nature'' articles. On 18 March,<ref>In contrast to his other letters to Crick, Wilkins dated this one.</ref> in response to receiving a copy of their preliminary manuscript, Wilkins penned the following: \"I think you're a couple of old rogues, but you may well have something\".<ref>\"Old rogues\" letter is preserved in the Crick archives at the University of California at San Diego, and was posted as part of their web collection. It is also quoted by both Maddox, p. 208, and Olby.</ref>\n\nWeeks later, on 10 April, Franklin wrote to Crick for permission to see their model.<ref>10 April 1953 Franklin postcard to Crick asking permission to view model. The original is in the Crick archives at the University of California, San Diego.</ref> Franklin retained her scepticism for premature model building even after seeing the Watson\u2013Crick model, and remained unimpressed. She is reported to have commented, \"It's very pretty, but how are they going to prove it?\" As an experimental scientist, Franklin seems to have been interested in producing far greater evidence before publishing-as-proven a proposed model. As such, her response to the Watson\u2013Crick model was in keeping with her cautious approach to science.<ref>Holt, J. (2002).</ref>\n\nCrick and Watson then published their model in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' on 25 April 1953 in an article describing the double-helical structure of DNA with only a footnote acknowledging \"having been stimulated by a general knowledge of\" Franklin and Wilkins' \"unpublished\" contribution.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite journal |authors=Watson, J.

She again used X-ray crystallography to study the structure of the [[tobacco mosaic virus]] (TMV), an [[RNA virus]]. Her meeting with Aaron Klug in early 1954 led to a longstanding and successful collaboration. Klug had just then earned his PhD from [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], and joined Birkbeck in late 1953. In 1955 Franklin published her first major works on TMV in ''Nature'', in which she described that all TMV virus particles were of the same length.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Franklin |first1=RE. |title=Structure of Tobacco Mosaic Virus |journal=Nature |year=1955 |volume=175 |issue=4452 |pages=379\u2013381 |doi=10.1038/175379a0 |pmid=14356181 |bibcode=1955Natur.175..379F}}</ref> This was in direct contradiction to the ideas of the eminent virologist [[Norman Pirie]], though her observation ultimately proved correct.<ref>Maddox, p. 252.</ref>\n\nFranklin assigned the study of the complete structure of TMV to her PhD student Holmes.

She obtained Bernal's consent in July 1957, though serious concerns were raised after she disclosed her intentions to research live, instead of killed, polio virus at Birkbeck. Eventually, Bernal arranged for the virus to be safely stored at the [[London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine]] during the group's research. With her group, Franklin then commenced deciphering the structure of the polio virus while it was in a crystalline state. She attempted to mount the virus crystals in capillary tubes for X-ray studies, but was forced to end her work due to her rapidly failing health.<ref>Brown, p. 359.</ref>\n\nAfter Franklin's death, [[Aaron Klug|Klug]] succeeded her as group leader, and he, Finch and Holmes continued researching the structure of the polio virus. They eventually succeeded in obtaining extremely detailed X-ray images of the virus. In June 1959, Klug and Finch published the group's findings, revealing the polio virus to have icosahedral symmetry, and in the same paper suggested the possibility for all spherical viruses to possess the same symmetry, as it permitted the greatest possible number (60) of identical structural units.<ref>Brown, pp. 360\u2013361.</ref> The team moved to the [[Laboratory of Molecular Biology]], Cambridge in 1962,<ref>Glynn, p. 153.</ref> and the old Torrington Square laboratories were demolished four years later, in May 1966.<ref>Brown, p. 466.</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nFranklin was best described as an [[agnostic]]. Her lack of religious faith apparently did not stem from anyone's influence, rather from her own line of thinking. She developed her scepticism as a young child. Her mother recalled that she refused to believe in the [[existence of God]], and remarked, \"Well, anyhow, how do you know He isn't She?\"<ref>Glynn, p. 12.</ref> She later made her position clear, now based on her scientific experience, and wrote to her father in 1940:\n{{quote|[S]cience and everyday life cannot and should not be separated. Science, for me, gives a partial explanation of life&nbsp;... I do not accept your definition of faith i.e. belief in life after death&nbsp;... Your faith rests on the future of yourself and others as individuals, mine in the future and fate of our successors. It seems to me that yours is the more selfish&nbsp;...<ref>Glynn, p. 62.</ref> [as to] the question of a creator. A creator of what?&nbsp;... I see no reason to believe that a creator of protoplasm or primeval matter, if such there be, has any reason to be interested in our insignificant race in a tiny corner of the universe.<ref name=\"Maddox, p. 61\">Maddox, p. 61.</ref>}}\n\nHowever, she did not abandon Jewish traditions. As the only Jewish student at Lindores School, she had Hebrew lessons on her own while her friends went to church.<ref>Glynn, p. 19.</ref> She joined the Jewish Society while in her first term at Newnham College, Cambridge, out of respect of her grandfather's request.<ref>Glynn, p. 44.</ref> Franklin confided to her sister that she was \"always consciously a Jew\".<ref name=\"Maddox, p. 61\"/>\n\nFranklin loved travelling abroad, particularly [[trekking]]. She first \"qualified\" at Christmas 1929 for a vacation at [[Menton]], France, where her grandfather went to escape English winter.<ref>Glynn, p. 16.</ref> Her family frequently spent vacations in Wales or Cornwall. A trip to France in 1938 gave her a lasting love for France and its language. She considered the French lifestyle at that time as \"vastly superior to that of English\".<ref name=\"Polcovar, p. 33\">Polcovar, p. 33.</ref> In contrast, she described English people as having \"vacant stupid faces and childlike complacency\".<ref>Polcovar, p. 59.</ref> Her family was almost stuck in Norway in 1939, as World War II was declared on their way home.<ref>Glynn, p. 33.</ref> In another instance, she trekked the French Alps with Jean Kerslake in 1946, which almost cost her her life. She slipped off on a slope, and was barely rescued.<ref>Glynn, p. 79.</ref> But she wrote to her mother, \"I am quite sure I could wander happily in France forever. I love the people, the country and the food.\"<ref name=\"Polcovar, p. 41\">Polcovar, p. 41.</ref>\n\nShe made several professional trips to US, and was particularly jovial among her American friends and constantly displayed her sense of humour. William Ginoza of the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] later recalled that she was the opposite of Watson's description of her, and as Maddox comments, Americans enjoyed her \"sunny side\".<ref>Maddox, p. 277.</ref>\n\nIn his book ''The Double Helix,'' Watson provides his first-person account of the search for and discovery of DNA. He paints a sympathetic but sometimes critical portrait of Franklin. He praises her intellect and scientific acumen, but portrays her as difficult to work with and careless with her appearance. After introducing her in the book as \"Rosalind,\" he writes that he and his male colleagues usually referred to her as \"Rosy\", the name people at King's College London used behind her back.<ref>Watson, p. 16.</ref> She did not want to be called by that name because she had a great-aunt Rosy. In the family, she was called \"Ros\".<ref>Glynn, p. 157.</ref> To others, she was simply \"Rosalind\". She made it clear to an American visiting friend Dorothea Raacke, while sitting with her at Crick's table in [[The Eagle, Cambridge|The Eagle]] pub in Cambridge: Raacke asked her how she was to be called and she replied \"I'm afraid it will have to be Rosalind\", adding \"Most definitely not ''Rosy''.\"<ref name=\"Maddox, p. 288\">Maddox, p. 288.</ref>\n\nShe often expressed her political views. She initially blamed [[Winston Churchill]] for inciting the war, but later admired him for his speeches. She actively supported Professor [[John Ryle (physician)|John Ryle]] as an independent candidate for parliament in 1940, but he was unsuccessful.<ref name=\"Glynn, p. 52\">Glynn, p. 52.</ref>\n\nShe did not seem to have an intimate relationship with anyone, and always kept her deepest personal feelings to herself. After her younger days, she avoided close friendship with the opposite sex. In her later years, Evi Ellis, who had shared her bedroom when a child refugee and who was then married to Ernst Wohlgemuth<ref name=genealogy/> and had moved to Notting Hill from Chicago, tried matchmaking her with [[Ralph Miliband]] but failed. Franklin once told Evi that her flatmate asked her for a drink, but she did not understand the intention.<ref>Maddox, p. 261.</ref> She was quite infatuated by her French mentor Mering, who had a wife and a mistress.<ref name=\"Polcovar, p. 41\"/> Mering also admitted that he was captivated by her \"intelligence and beauty\".<ref>Polcovar, p. 51.</ref> According to [[Anne Sayre]], Franklin did confess her feeling for Mering when she was undergoing surgery, but her family denied this{{when|date=February 2020}}. Mering wept when he visited her later,<ref name=\"Glynn, p. 52\"/> and destroyed all her letters.{{when|date=February 2020}}<ref>Maddox, p. 287.</ref>\n\nHer closest personal affair was probably with her once post-doctoral student [[Donald Caspar]]. In 1956, she visited him at his home in Colorado after her tour to [[University of California, Berkeley]], and she was known to remark later that Caspar was one \"she might have loved, might have married\". In her letter to Sayre, she described him as \"an ideal match\".<ref>Maddox, p. 283.</ref>\n\n===Illness and death===\nIn mid-1956, while on a work-related trip to the United States, Franklin first began to suspect a health problem. While in New York she found difficulty in zipping her skirt; her stomach had bulged. Back in London she consulted Mair Livingstone, who asked her, \"You're not pregnant?\" to which she retorted, \"I wish I were.\" Her case was marked \"URGENT\".<ref>Maddox, p. 284.</ref> An operation on 4 September of the same year revealed two tumours in her abdomen.<ref>Maddox, p. 285.</ref> After this period and other periods of hospitalization, Franklin spent time convalescing with various friends and family members. These included Anne Sayre, Francis Crick, his wife Odile, with whom Franklin had formed a strong friendship,<ref name=\"Maddox, p. 288\"/> and finally with the Roland and Nina Franklin family where Rosalind's nieces and nephews bolstered her spirits.\n\nFranklin chose not to stay with her parents because her mother's uncontrollable grief and crying upset her too much. Even while undergoing cancer treatment, Franklin continued to work, and her group continued to produce results \u2013 seven papers in 1956 and six more in 1957.<ref>Maddox, p. 292.</ref> At the end of 1957, Franklin again fell ill and she was admitted to the [[Royal Marsden Hospital]]. On 2 December, she made her will. She named her three brothers as executors and made her colleague Aaron Klug the principal beneficiary, who would receive \u00a33,000 and her Austin car. Her other friends Mair Livingstone would get \u00a32,000, Anne Piper \u00a31,000, and her nurse Miss Griffith \u00a3250. The remainder of the estate was to be used for charities.<ref>Maddox, p. 301.</ref>\n\nShe returned to work in January 1958, and she was given a promotion to Research Associate in Biophysics on 25 February.<ref>Maddox, p. 302.</ref> She fell ill again on 30 March, and she died on 16 April 1958, in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], London,<ref>GRO Register of Deaths: JUN 1958 5c 257 CHELSEA \u2013 Rosalind E.

She in fact laughed at men who were embarrassed by the appointment of the first female professor [[Dorothy Garrod]].<ref>Maddox, p. 48.</ref>\n\n===Contribution to the model of DNA===\nRosalind Franklin's first important contributions to the model popularised by Crick and Watson was her lecture at the seminar in November 1951, where she presented to those present, among them Watson, the two forms of the molecule, type A and type B, her position being that the phosphate units are located in the external part of the molecule. She also specified the amount of water to be found in the molecule in accordance with other parts of it, data that have considerable importance in terms of the stability of the molecule. Franklin was the first to discover and formulate these facts, which in fact constituted the basis for all later attempts to build a model of the molecule. However, Watson, at the time ignorant of the chemistry, failed to comprehend the crucial information, and this led to construction of a wrong model.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Everson |first1=Ted |title=The Gene: A Historical Perspective |year=2007 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Connecticut |isbn=978-0-313-33449-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/genehistoricalpe0000ever/page/85 85] |url=https://archive.org/details/genehistoricalpe0000ever|url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\nThe other contribution included an X-ray photograph of B-DNA (called ''[[Photo 51]]'')<ref>Maddox, pp. 177\u2013178.</ref> taken by Franklin's student Gosling that was briefly shown to Watson by Wilkins in January 1953,<ref name=\"Maddox, p. 196\">Maddox, p. 196.</ref><ref>Crick (1988), p. 67.</ref> and a report written for an MRC biophysics committee visit to King's in December 1952 which was shown by Perutz at the Cavendish Laboratory to both Crick and Watson.

A preliminary version of much of the important material contained in the 1952 December MRC report had been presented by Franklin in a talk she had given in November 1951, which Watson had attended but not understood.<ref name=\"Maddox 199\"/><ref>Watson (1969).</ref>\n\nThe Perutz letter was as said one of three letters, published with letters by Wilkins and Watson, which discussed their various contributions. Watson clarified the importance of the data obtained from the MRC report as he had not recorded these data while attending Franklin's lecture in 1951. The upshot of all this was that when Crick and Watson started to build their model in February 1953 they were working with critical parameters that had been determined by Franklin in 1951, and which she and Gosling had significantly refined in 1952, as well as with published data and other very similar data to those available at King's. It was generally believed that Franklin was never aware that her work had been used during construction of the model,<ref>Maddox, p. 316.</ref> but Gosling asserted in his 2013 interview that, \"Yes. Oh, she did know about that.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Attar |first1=N |title=Raymond Gosling: the man who crystallized genes |journal=Genome Biology |year=2013 |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=402 |doi=10.1186/gb-2013-14-4-402|pmid=23651528 |pmc=3663117}}</ref>\n\n====Recognition of her contribution to the model of DNA====\nUpon the completion of their model, Crick and Watson had invited Wilkins to be a co-author of their paper describing the structure.<ref>Wilkins, p. 213.</ref> Wilkins turned down this offer, as he had taken no part in building the model.<ref>Wilkins, p. 214.</ref> He later expressed regret that greater discussion of co-authorship had not taken place as this might have helped to clarify the contribution the work at King's had made to the discovery.<ref>Wilkins, p. 226.</ref> There is no doubt that Franklin's experimental data were used by Crick and Watson to build their model of DNA in 1953. Some, including Maddox, have explained this citation omission by suggesting that it may be a question of circumstance, because it would have been very difficult to cite the unpublished work from the MRC report they had seen.<ref name=\"Maddox 207\"/>\n\nIndeed, a clear timely acknowledgment would have been awkward, given the unorthodox manner in which data were transferred from King's to Cambridge. However, methods were available. Watson and Crick could have cited the MRC report as a personal communication or else cited the ''Acta ''articles in press, or most easily, the third ''Nature'' paper that they knew was in press. One of the most important accomplishments of Maddox's widely acclaimed biography is that Maddox made a well-received case for inadequate acknowledgement. \"Such acknowledgement as they gave her was very muted and always coupled with the name of Wilkins\".<ref>Maddox, pp. 316\u2013317, and other parts of the epilogue.</ref>\n\nFifteen years after the fact, the first clear recitation of Franklin's contribution appeared as it permeated Watson's account, ''The Double Helix'', although it was buried under descriptions of Watson's (often quite negative) regard towards Franklin during the period of their work on DNA. This attitude is epitomized in the confrontation between Watson and Franklin over a preprint of Pauling's mistaken DNA manuscript.<ref>Watson, J.D. (1968), pp. 95\u201396.</ref> Watson's words impelled Sayre to write her rebuttal, in which the entire chapter nine, \"Winner Take All\" has the structure of a legal brief dissecting and analyzing the topic of acknowledgement.<ref>Sayre, A. (1975), pp. 156\u2013167.</ref>\n\nSayre's early analysis was often ignored because of perceived feminist overtones in her book. Watson and Crick did not cite the X-ray diffraction work of Wilkins and Franklin in their original paper, though they admit having \"been stimulated by a knowledge of the general nature of the unpublished experimental results and ideas of Dr. M. H. F. Wilkins, Dr. R. E. Franklin and their co-workers at King's College London\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> In fact, Watson and Crick cited no experimental data at all in support of their model. Franklin and Gosling's publication of the DNA X-ray image, in the same issue of ''Nature'', served as the principal evidence:\n{{quote|\"Thus our general ideas are not inconsistent with the model proposed by Watson and Crick in the preceding communication\".<ref name=\"FG\">{{cite journal |last1=Franklin |first1=Rosalind E. |authorlink1=Rosalind Franklin |last2=Gosling |first2=R.

{"title_page": "Hessian matrix", "text_new": "{{short description|(Mathematical) matrix of second derivatives}}\n{{Calculus|Multivariable}}\n\nIn [[mathematic]]s, the '''Hessian matrix''' or '''Hessian''' is a [[square matrix]] of second-order [[partial derivative]]s of a scalar-valued [[function (mathematics)|function]], or [[scalar field]].

Thus,\n\n:<math>\\frac {\\partial}{\\partial x_i} \\left(\\frac {\\partial f }{\\partial x_j} \\right) =\n       \\frac {\\partial}{\\partial x_j} \\left(\\frac {\\partial f }{\\partial x_i} \\right).</math>\n\nIn a formal statement: if the second partial derivatives of {{math|''f''}} are all [[continuous function|continuous]] in a [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] {{math|''D''}} of a given point, then the Hessian of {{math|''f''}} is a [[symmetric matrix]] throughout {{math|''D''}}; see [[symmetry of second derivatives]].\n\n== Applications ==\n\n=== Second-derivative test ===\n{{Main|Second partial derivative test}}\n\nThe Hessian matrix of a [[convex function]] is [[positive semi-definite matrix|positive semi-definite]]. Refining this property allows us to test whether a [[critical point (mathematics)|critical point]] {{mvar|x}} is a local maximum, local minimum, or a saddle point, as follows:\n\nIf the Hessian is [[Positive-definite matrix|positive-definite]] at {{mvar|x}}, then {{mvar|f}} attains an isolated local minimum at {{mvar|x}}. If the Hessian is [[Positive-definite matrix#Negative-definite, semidefinite and indefinite matrices|negative-definite]] at {{mvar|x}}, then {{mvar|f}} attains an isolated local maximum at {{mvar|x}}. If the Hessian has both positive and negative [[eigenvalue]]s, then {{mvar|x}} is a [[saddle point]] for {{mvar|f}}. Otherwise the test is inconclusive. This implies that at a local minimum the Hessian is positive-semidefinite, and at a local maximum the Hessian is negative-semidefinite.\n\nNote that for positive-semidefinite and negative-semidefinite Hessians the test is inconclusive (a critical point where the Hessian is semidefinite but not definite may be a local extremum or a saddle point). However, more can be said from the point of view of [[Morse theory]].\n\nThe [[second-derivative test]] for functions of one and two variables is simple. In one variable, the Hessian contains just one second derivative; if it is positive, then {{mvar|x}} is a local minimum, and if it is negative, then {{mvar|x}} is a local maximum; if it is zero, then the test is inconclusive. In two variables, the [[determinant]] can be used, because the determinant is the product of the eigenvalues. If it is positive, then the eigenvalues are both positive, or both negative. If it is negative, then the two eigenvalues have different signs. If it is zero, then the second-derivative test is inconclusive.\n\nEquivalently, the second-order conditions that are sufficient for a local minimum or maximum can be expressed in terms of the sequence of principal (upper-leftmost) [[minor (linear algebra)|minors]] (determinants of sub-matrices) of the Hessian; these conditions are a special case of those given in the next section for bordered Hessians for constrained optimization\u2014the case in which the number of constraints is zero. Specifically, the sufficient condition for a minimum is that all of these principal minors be positive, while the sufficient condition for a maximum is that the minors alternate in sign, with the 1\u00d71 minor being negative.\n\n=== Critical points ===\n\nIf the [[gradient]] (the vector of the partial derivatives) of a function {{math|''f''}} is zero at some point {{math|'''x'''}}, then {{math|''f''}} has a ''[[critical point (mathematics)|critical point]]'' (or ''[[stationary point]]'') at {{math|'''x'''}}. The [[determinant]] of the Hessian at {{math|'''x'''}} is then called the [[discriminant]]. If this determinant is zero then {{math|'''x'''}} is called a ''degenerate critical point'' of {{math|''f''}}, or a ''non-Morse critical point'' of {{math|''f''}}. Otherwise it is non-degenerate, and called a ''Morse critical point'' of {{math|''f''}}.\n\nThe Hessian matrix plays an important role in [[Morse theory]] and [[catastrophe theory]], because its [[kernel of a matrix|kernel]] and [[eigenvalue]]s allow classification of the critical points.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=geruGMKT9_UC&pg=PA248|title=Advanced Calculus: A Geometric View|last=Callahan|first=James J.|date=2010|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-4419-7332-0|page=248|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tcn3CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA178|title=Recent Developments in General Relativity|editor-last=Casciaro|editor-first=B.|editor-last2=Fortunato|editor-first2=D.|editor-last3=Francaviglia|editor-first3=M.|editor-last4=Masiello|editor-first4=A.|date=2011|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=9788847021136|page=178|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=Domenico P.

That is,\n\n:<math>y=f(\\mathbf{x} + \\Delta\\mathbf{x})\\approx f(\\mathbf{x}) + \\nabla f(\\mathbf{x})^\\mathrm{T} \\Delta\\mathbf{x} + \\frac{1}{2} \\Delta\\mathbf{x}^\\mathrm{T} \\mathbf{H}(\\mathbf{x}) \\Delta\\mathbf{x}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|\u2207''f''}} is the [[gradient]] {{math|({{sfrac|\u2202''f''|\u2202''x''<sub>1</sub>}}, ..., {{sfrac|\u2202''f''|\u2202''x<sub>n</sub>''}})}}. Computing and storing the full Hessian matrix takes [[Big theta|{{math|\u0398(''n''<sup>2</sup>)}}]] memory, which is infeasible for high-dimensional functions such as the [[loss function]]s of [[artificial neural network|neural nets]], [[conditional random field]]s, and other [[statistical model]]s with large numbers of parameters. For such situations, [[truncated Newton method|truncated-Newton]] and [[quasi-Newton method|quasi-Newton]] algorithms have been developed. The latter family of algorithms use approximations to the Hessian; one of the most popular quasi-Newton algorithms is [[Broyden\u2013Fletcher\u2013Goldfarb\u2013Shanno algorithm|BFGS]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nocedal |first1=Jorge |authorlink1=Jorge Nocedal |last2=Wright |first2=Stephen |year=2000 |title=Numerical Optimization |isbn=978-0-387-98793-4 |publisher=Springer Verlag}}</ref>\n\nSuch approximations may use the fact that an optimization algorithm uses the Hessian only as a [[linear operator]] {{math|'''H'''('''v''')}}, and proceed by first noticing that the Hessian also appears in the local expansion of the gradient:\n\n:<math>\\nabla f (\\mathbf{x} + \\Delta\\mathbf{x}) = \\nabla f (\\mathbf{x}) + \\mathbf{H}(\\mathbf{x})\\Delta\\mathbf{x} + \\mathcal{O}(\\|\\Delta\\mathbf{x}\\|^2)</math>\n\nLetting {{math|\u0394'''x''' {{=}} ''r'''''v'''}} for some scalar {{mvar|r}}, this gives\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{H}(\\mathbf{x})\\Delta\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{H}(\\mathbf{x})r\\mathbf{v} = r\\mathbf{H}(\\mathbf{x})\\mathbf{v} = \\nabla f (\\mathbf{x} + r\\mathbf{v}) - \\nabla f (\\mathbf{x}) + \\mathcal{O}(r^2),</math>\n\ni.e.,\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{H}(\\mathbf{x})\\mathbf{v} = \\frac{1}{r} \\Bigl[ \\nabla f (\\mathbf{x} + r\\mathbf{v}) - \\nabla f (\\mathbf{x}) \\Bigr] + \\mathcal{O}(r)</math>\n\nso if the gradient is already computed, the approximate Hessian can be computed by a linear (in the size of the gradient) number of scalar operations.

If the Hessian has both positive and negative [[eigenvalue]]s, then {{mvar|x}} is a [[saddle point]] for {{mvar|f}}. Otherwise the test is inconclusive. This implies that at a local minimum the Hessian is positive-semidefinite, and at a local maximum the Hessian is negative-semidefinite.\n\nNote that for positive-semidefinite and negative-semidefinite Hessians the test is inconclusive (a critical point where the Hessian is semidefinite but not definite may be a local extremum or a saddle point). However, more can be said from the point of view of [[Morse theory]].\n\nThe [[second-derivative test]] for functions of one and two variables is simple. In one variable, the Hessian contains just one second derivative; if it is positive, then {{mvar|x}} is a local minimum, and if it is negative, then {{mvar|x}} is a local maximum; if it is zero, then the test is inconclusive. In two variables, the [[determinant]] can be used, because the determinant is the product of the eigenvalues. If it is positive, then the eigenvalues are both positive, or both negative. If it is negative, then the two eigenvalues have different signs. If it is zero, then the second-derivative test is inconclusive.\n\nEquivalently, the second-order conditions that are sufficient for a local minimum or maximum can be expressed in terms of the sequence of principal (upper-leftmost) [[minor (linear algebra)|minors]] (determinants of sub-matrices) of the Hessian; these conditions are a special case of those given in the next section for bordered Hessians for constrained optimization\u2014the case in which the number of constraints is zero. Specifically, the sufficient condition for a minimum is that all of these principal minors be positive, while the sufficient condition for a maximum is that the minors alternate in sign, with the 1\u00d71 minor being negative.\n\n=== Critical points ===\n\nIf the [[gradient]] (the vector of the partial derivatives) of a function {{math|''f''}} is zero at some point {{math|'''x'''}}, then {{math|''f''}} has a ''[[critical point (mathematics)|critical point]]'' (or ''[[stationary point]]'') at {{math|'''x'''}}. The [[determinant]] of the Hessian at {{math|'''x'''}} is then called the [[discriminant]]. If this determinant is zero then {{math|'''x'''}} is called a ''degenerate critical point'' of {{math|''f''}}, or a ''non-Morse critical point'' of {{math|''f''}}. Otherwise it is non-degenerate, and called a ''Morse critical point'' of {{math|''f''}}.\n\nThe Hessian matrix plays an important role in [[Morse theory]] and [[catastrophe theory]], because its [[kernel of a matrix|kernel]] and [[eigenvalue]]s allow classification of the critical points.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=geruGMKT9_UC&pg=PA248|title=Advanced Calculus: A Geometric View|last=Callahan|first=James J.|date=2010|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-4419-7332-0|page=248|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tcn3CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA178|title=Recent Developments in General Relativity|editor-last=Casciaro|editor-first=B.|editor-last2=Fortunato|editor-first2=D.|editor-last3=Francaviglia|editor-first3=M.|editor-last4=Masiello|editor-first4=A.|date=2011|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=9788847021136|page=178|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=Domenico P.

That is,\n\n:<math>y=f(\\mathbf{x} + \\Delta\\mathbf{x})\\approx f(\\mathbf{x}) + \\nabla f(\\mathbf{x})^\\mathrm{T} \\Delta\\mathbf{x} + \\frac{1}{2} \\Delta\\mathbf{x}^\\mathrm{T} \\mathbf{H}(\\mathbf{x}) \\Delta\\mathbf{x}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|\u2207''f''}} is the [[gradient]] {{math|({{sfrac|\u2202''f''|\u2202''x''<sub>1</sub>}}, ..., {{sfrac|\u2202''f''|\u2202''x<sub>n</sub>''}})}}. Computing and storing the full Hessian matrix takes [[Big theta|{{math|\u0398(''n''<sup>2</sup>)}}]] memory, which is infeasible for high-dimensional functions such as the [[loss function]]s of [[artificial neural network|neural nets]], [[conditional random field]]s, and other [[statistical model]]s with large numbers of parameters. For such situations, [[truncated Newton method|truncated-Newton]] and [[quasi-Newton method|quasi-Newton]] algorithms have been developed. The latter family of algorithms use approximations to the Hessian; one of the most popular quasi-Newton algorithms is [[Broyden\u2013Fletcher\u2013Goldfarb\u2013Shanno algorithm|BFGS]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nocedal |first1=Jorge |authorlink1=Jorge Nocedal |last2=Wright |first2=Stephen |year=2000 |title=Numerical Optimization |isbn=978-0-387-98793-4 |publisher=Springer Verlag}}</ref>\n\nSuch approximations may use the fact that an optimization algorithm uses the Hessian only as a [[linear operator]] {{math|'''H'''('''v''')}}, and proceed by first noticing that the Hessian also appears in the local expansion of the gradient:\n\n:<math>\\nabla f (\\mathbf{x} + \\Delta\\mathbf{x}) = \\nabla f (\\mathbf{x}) + \\mathbf{H}(\\mathbf{x})\\Delta\\mathbf{x} + \\mathcal{O}(\\|\\Delta\\mathbf{x}\\|^2)</math>\n\nLetting {{math|\u0394'''x''' {{=}} ''r'''''v'''}} for some scalar {{mvar|r}}, this gives\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{H}(\\mathbf{x})\\Delta\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{H}(\\mathbf{x})r\\mathbf{v} = r\\mathbf{H}(\\mathbf{x})\\mathbf{v} = \\nabla f (\\mathbf{x} + r\\mathbf{v}) - \\nabla f (\\mathbf{x}) + \\mathcal{O}(r^2),</math>\n\ni.e.,\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{H}(\\mathbf{x})\\mathbf{v} = \\frac{1}{r} \\Bigl[ \\nabla f (\\mathbf{x} + r\\mathbf{v}) - \\nabla f (\\mathbf{x}) \\Bigr] + \\mathcal{O}(r)</math>\n\nso if the gradient is already computed, the approximate Hessian can be computed by a linear (in the size of the gradient) number of scalar operations.

A sufficient condition for a local ''minimum'' is that all of these minors have the sign of (\u20131)<sup>''m''</sup>.
