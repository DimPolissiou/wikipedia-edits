The harbor tug ''[[USS Cheraw (YTB-802)|USS Cheraw]]'' was named in the town's honor.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nWhen the first Europeans arrived in the area it was inhabited by the [[Cheraw]] and [[Pee Dee people|Pee Dee]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] tribes. The Cheraw lived near the waterfall hill, near present-day Cheraw, but by the 1730s they had been devastated by new infectious disease inadvertently carried by the European traders. Survivors joined the [[Catawba people|Catawba Confederacy]] for safety and left their name in history. Only a few scattered Cheraw families remained by the time of the [[American Revolution]]. A few European settlers entered their territory in the 1730s, forced upriver when the [[Wales|Welsh]] came to claim the Welsh [[Baptist]] lands granted by the English government in the area around [[Society Hill, South Carolina|Society Hill]]. Many of the early settlers of the 1740s in Cheraw were ethnic [[English people|English]], [[Scottish people|Scots]], [[French people|French]] [[Huguenots]], or [[Irish people|Scots-Irish]].\n\nBy 1750, Cheraw had become an established Anglo-American village with a growing river trade, one of the first inland villages. It was one of only six places in South Carolina that appeared on English maps at the time. In the 1760s, Joseph and Eli Kershaw were granted the part of Cheraw that is now the downtown historic district. The Kershaws laid out a formal street system. By 1830 settlers lined all the streets with rows of [[Ulmus americana|elms]]. The Kershaws originally called the town \"Chatham\", but people never accepted this name, continuing to call it \"Cheraw\" or \"Cheraw Hill\".\n\n===American Revolution===\nThere was a lack of organization and rule during the beginning of the 1740s in the backcountry of South Carolina. This lack of organization and unrest was an underlying cause of the resentment people of these areas felt toward the British Crown. In the Pee Dee area, planters organized a group called [[War of the Regulation|the Regulators]] to help bring order to the area. In 1768 [[St. David's Episcopal Church and Cemetery|St. David's Parish]], the last [[Anglican Church]] built in South Carolina under [[King George III]], was established to help serve the civic and religious needs of the Cheraw area. Later a judicial district and courthouse were established to help deal with the problem of order. However, there was still much discontent with the ruling authority, and in May 1776 the grand jury of the Cheraws District Two declared its independence from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]].\n\nMany area men played prominent roles in the [[American Revolution]]. They included Claudius Pegues, General Henry W. Harrington, the Ellerbe brothers, Philip Pledger, and Eli Kershaw. There was much unrest in the area during this time because Cheraw fell into part of the British strategic line of defense, where [[garrison]]s were built to control revolutionaries and to encourage [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalists]]. Other towns in this line of defense included [[Camden, South Carolina]], and [[Augusta, Georgia]]. Cheraw also became a strategic point for the Americans. Military activity was especially heavy in Cheraw and surrounding counties from 1780-1781. During the Revolutionary War, [[St. David's Episcopal Church and Cemetery|St. David's Church]] was used as a hospital for British troops that operated under [[Lord Cornwallis]]'s command and as quarters for the South Carolina militia. In December 1780, just across from Cheraw, American commander General [[Nathanael Greene]] set up a \"camp of repose\" to rest and train his men.\n\n===Early 19th century===\nIn 1819, the first [[steamboat]] came up river, and along with it a burst of prosperity because of expanded trade. Cheraw was incorporated as a town in 1820. The main crops from the Cheraw area were [[Maize|corn]], [[cotton]], [[tobacco]], [[rice]] and [[indigo]]. Cheraw had the largest cotton market between [[Georgetown, South Carolina]], and [[Wilmington, North Carolina]]. Because of the cotton trade, the town boasted the largest bank in South Carolina outside of [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] before the Civil War. Despite a serious fire in 1835, by 1850 the town was a prosperous center of trade.\n\n===Civil War===\n<!-- Missing image removed: [[Image:Cheraw Confederate Monument.jpg|thumb|right|The Confederate Monument in Cheraw is the oldest in the country.]] -->\nLeading up to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Cheraw citizens played a key role in South Carolina's secession from the Union. On November 19, 1860, the first call for secession in a public meeting was made at the Chesterfield County Courthouse. John A. Inglis of Cheraw was in attendance. He later introduced the resolution for South Carolina to secede. Inglis was also named the chairman of the committee that wrote the document for South Carolina's secession.\n\nFrom the beginning of the war, Cheraw was known as a place of refuge and a storehouse for valuables. In March 1865, General [[William T. Sherman]] brought his [[Union Army|Union]] troops to Cheraw for several days. One Union soldier said that they found Cheraw to be \"a pleasant town and an old one with the Southern aristocratic bearing.\" Sherman used this as a time to gain more control over his men. No private dwellings or public buildings in Cheraw were destroyed by Sherman and his troops. However, an accidental explosion of captured gunpowder at the river hill burned the Cheraw business district. The county courthouse in [[Chesterfield, South Carolina|Chesterfield]] was burned in this event, resulting in the loss of many records. Thus, it is difficult to date many of the historic properties.\n\nDuring the Civil War, St.&nbsp;David's Church was used as a hospital by both the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] and Union armies. Some troops from both armies were buried there. The first Confederate monument was erected there in 1867, a claim disputed by [[Confederate Memorial (Romney, West Virginia)|Romney, West Virginia]]. Originally, the monument did not mention the Confederate soldiers because the area was still occupied by Federal troops.\n\n===20th century to present===\n\nThe Civil War caused great economic hardship in Cheraw, as it did in the entire South. However, by the early 1900s, prosperity began to return to Cheraw. The Great Depression again brought change. [[Cheraw State Park]] and Sandhills State Forest were both founded in the 1930s. By the 1950s and 1960s the groundwork was laid for industrial growth. By the end of the 20th century, Cheraw had a balanced industrial base while maintaining its historic charm, architectural treasures and natural resources.\n\nIn November, 1941, Cheraw saw pretend combat in its streets during the Battle of Pee Dee River, Phase 1 of the Carolina Maneuvers.

The harbor tug ''[[USS Cheraw (YTB-802)|USS Cheraw]]'' was named in the town's honor.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nWhen the first Europeans arrived in the area it was inhabited by the [[Cheraw]] and [[Pee Dee people|Pee Dee]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] tribes. The Cheraw lived near the waterfall hill, near present-day Cheraw, but by the 1730s they had been devastated by new infectious disease inadvertently carried by the European traders. Survivors joined the [[Catawba people|Catawba Confederacy]] for safety and left their name in history. Only a few scattered Cheraw families remained by the time of the [[American Revolution]]. A few European settlers entered their territory in the 1730s, forced upriver when the [[Wales|Welsh]] came to claim the Welsh [[Baptist]] lands granted by the English government in the area around [[Society Hill, South Carolina|Society Hill]]. Many of the early settlers of the 1740s in Cheraw were ethnic [[English people|English]], [[Scottish people|Scots]], [[French people|French]] [[Huguenots]], or [[Irish people|Scots-Irish]].\n\nBy 1750, Cheraw had become an established Anglo-American village with a growing river trade, one of the first inland villages. It was one of only six places in South Carolina that appeared on English maps at the time. In the 1760s, Joseph and Eli Kershaw were granted the part of Cheraw that is now the downtown historic district. The Kershaws laid out a formal street system. By 1830 settlers lined all the streets with rows of [[Ulmus americana|elms]]. The Kershaws originally called the town \"Chatham\", but people never accepted this name, continuing to call it \"Cheraw\" or \"Cheraw Hill\".\n\n===American Revolution===\nThere was a lack of organization and rule during the beginning of the 1740s in the backcountry of South Carolina. This lack of organization and unrest was an underlying cause of the resentment people of these areas felt toward the British Crown. In the Pee Dee area, planters organized a group called [[War of the Regulation|the Regulators]] to help bring order to the area. In 1768 [[St. David's Episcopal Church and Cemetery|St. David's Parish]], the last [[Anglican Church]] built in South Carolina under [[King George III]], was established to help serve the civic and religious needs of the Cheraw area. Later a judicial district and courthouse were established to help deal with the problem of order. However, there was still much discontent with the ruling authority, and in May 1776 the grand jury of the Cheraws District Two declared its independence from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]].\n\nMany area men played prominent roles in the [[American Revolution]]. They included Claudius Pegues, General Henry W. Harrington, the Ellerbe brothers, Philip Pledger, and Eli Kershaw. There was much unrest in the area during this time because Cheraw fell into part of the British strategic line of defense, where [[garrison]]s were built to control revolutionaries and to encourage [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalists]]. Other towns in this line of defense included [[Camden, South Carolina]], and [[Augusta, Georgia]]. Cheraw also became a strategic point for the Americans. Military activity was especially heavy in Cheraw and surrounding counties from 1780-1781. During the Revolutionary War, [[St. David's Episcopal Church and Cemetery|St. David's Church]] was used as a hospital for British troops that operated under [[Lord Cornwallis]]'s command and as quarters for the South Carolina militia. In December 1780, just across from Cheraw, American commander General [[Nathanael Greene]] set up a \"camp of repose\" to rest and train his men.\n\n===Early 19th century===\nIn 1819, the first [[steamboat]] came up river, and along with it a burst of prosperity because of expanded trade. Cheraw was incorporated as a town in 1820. The main crops from the Cheraw area were [[Maize|corn]], [[cotton]], [[tobacco]], [[rice]] and [[indigo]]. Cheraw had the largest cotton market between [[Georgetown, South Carolina]], and [[Wilmington, North Carolina]]. Because of the cotton trade, the town boasted the largest bank in South Carolina outside of [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] before the Civil War. Despite a serious fire in 1835, by 1850 the town was a prosperous center of trade.\n\n===Civil War===\n<!-- Missing image removed: [[Image:Cheraw Confederate Monument.jpg|thumb|right|The Confederate Monument in Cheraw is the oldest in the country.]] -->\nLeading up to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Cheraw citizens played a key role in South Carolina's secession from the Union. On November 19, 1860, the first call for secession in a public meeting was made at the Chesterfield County Courthouse. John A. Inglis of Cheraw was in attendance. He later introduced the resolution for South Carolina to secede. Inglis was also named the chairman of the committee that wrote the document for South Carolina's secession.\n\nFrom the beginning of the war, Cheraw was known as a place of refuge and a storehouse for valuables. In March 1865, General [[William T. Sherman]] brought his [[Union Army|Union]] troops to Cheraw for several days. One Union soldier said that they found Cheraw to be \"a pleasant town and an old one with the Southern aristocratic bearing.\" Sherman used this as a time to gain more control over his men. No private dwellings or public buildings in Cheraw were destroyed by Sherman and his troops. However, an accidental explosion of captured gunpowder at the river hill burned the Cheraw business district. The county courthouse in [[Chesterfield, South Carolina|Chesterfield]] was burned in this event, resulting in the loss of many records. Thus, it is difficult to date many of the historic properties.\n\nDuring the Civil War, St.&nbsp;David's Church was used as a hospital by both the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] and Union armies. Some troops from both armies were buried there. The first Confederate monument was erected there in 1867, a claim disputed by [[Confederate Memorial (Romney, West Virginia)|Romney, West Virginia]]. Originally, the monument did not mention the Confederate soldiers because the area was still occupied by Federal troops.\n\n===20th century to present===\n\nThe Civil War caused great economic hardship in Cheraw, as it did in the entire South. However, by the early 1900s, prosperity began to return to Cheraw. The Great Depression again brought change. [[Cheraw State Park]] and Sandhills State Forest were both founded in the 1930s. By the 1950s and 1960s the groundwork was laid for industrial growth. By the end of the 20th century, Cheraw had a balanced industrial base while maintaining its historic charm, architectural treasures and natural resources.\n\nIn November, 1941, Cheraw saw pretend combat in its streets during the Battle of Pee Dee River, Phase 1 of the Carolina Maneuvers.  General George Patton's 2nd Armored Division was the (Red) attacking force versus Major General Charles F. Thompson's I Corps defending (Blue).  Tanks from Patton's division penetrated the defenses and entered the city center to be met by defending anti-tank guns.  It was determined that Red's tanks were successful and Blue forces were forced to withdraw from the town.<ref>Page 139, \"The U.S. Army GHQ Maneuvers of 1941\", Christopher R.

Pushyagupta, a [[Vaishya]], was appointed the governor of [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] by the Mauryan regime. He ruled Girinagar (modern-day [[Junagadh]]) (322 BC to 294 BC) and built a dam on the Sudarshan lake.  Emperor [[Ashoka]], the grandson of Chandragupta Maurya, not only ordered engraving of his edicts on the rock at [[Junagadh]] but asked Governor Tusherpha to cut canals from the lake where an earlier Mauryan governor had built a dam. Between the decline of Mauryan power and Saurashtra coming under the sway of the Samprati Mauryas of [[Ujjain]], there was an [[Indo-Greek]] defeat in Gujarat of [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius]].  In 16th century manuscripts, there is an apocryphal story of a merchant of King Gondaphares landing in Gujarat with [[Apostle Thomas]].

The weather-beaten rock at Junagadh gives a glimpse of the ruler [[Rudradaman I]] (AD 100) of the Saka satraps known as [[Western Satraps]], or Kshatraps. Mahakshatrap Rudradaman I founded the Kardamaka dynasty which ruled from Anupa on the banks of the Narmada up to the Aparanta region which bordered Punjab. In Gujarat, several battles were fought between the south Indian [[Satavahana dynasty]] and the Western Satraps.\nThe greatest and the mightiest ruler of the Satavahana Dynasty was [[Gautamiputra Satakarni]] who defeated the Western Satraps and conquered some parts of Gujarat in the 2nd century AD.<ref>Trade And Trade Routes In Ancient India von Moti Chandra page: 99</ref>\n\n[[File:Gujuras of Sindh Circa AD 570-712.jpg|thumb|left|Coin of the Gujuras of [[Sindh]], [[Chavda dynasty]], circa AD 570\u2013712.

Vikramaditya's successor Skandagupta left an inscription (AD 450) on a rock at Junagadh which gives details of the governor's repairs to the embankment surrounding Sudarshan lake after it was damaged by floods. The Anarta and Saurashtra regions were both parts of the Gupta empire. Towards the middle of the 5th century, the Gupta empire went into decline. Senapati Bhatarka, the Maitraka general of the Guptas, took advantage of the situation and in 470 he set up what came to be known as the [[Maitraka]] state. He shifted his capital from Giringer to Valabhipur, near Bhavnagar, on Saurashtra's east coast. The Maitrakas of Vallabhi became very powerful with their rule prevailing over large parts of Gujarat and adjoining [[Malwa]]. A university was set up by the Maitrakas, which came to be known far and wide for its scholastic pursuits and was compared with the noted [[Nalanda university|Nalanda University]].

He was the third son and sixth child of [[Shah Jahan]] and [[Mumtaz Mahal]]. At the time of his birth, his father, Shah Jahan, was then the Subahdar (governor) of Gujarat, and his grandfather, [[Jehangir]], was the Mughal Emperor. Before he became emperor, Aurangzeb was made Subahdar of Gujarat subah as part of his training and was stationed at [[Ahmedabad]]. Aurangzeb was a notable expansionist and was amongst the wealthiest of the Mughal rulers, with an annual yearly tribute of \u00a338,624,680 (in 1690). During his lifetime, victories in the south expanded the Mughal Empire to more than 3.2 million square kilometres and he ruled over a population estimated as being in the range of 100\u2013150 million subjects.\n\nAurangzeb had great love for his place of birth. In 1704, he wrote a letter to his eldest son, [[Muhammad Azam Shah]], asking him to be kind and considerate to the people of Dahod as it was his birthplace. Muhammad Azam was then the Subedar (governor) of Gujarat.\n\nIn his letter, Aurangzeb wrote:<ref>{{cite web|title=Aurangzeb loved Dahod till the end|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/1682952/report-aurangzeb-loved-dahod-till-the-end|publisher=dnaindia.com|accessdate=4 October 2013|author=Ashish Vashi|date=1 May 2012|quote=Eminent historian Manekshah Commissariat has quoted from this letter in his book 'A History of Gujarat: Mughal period, from 1573 to 1758'.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927142458/http://www.dnaindia.com/india/1682952/report-aurangzeb-loved-dahod-till-the-end|archive-date=27 September 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{bquote| My son of exalted rank, the town of Dahod, one of the dependencies of Gujarat, is the birthplace of this sinner.

As per the results of livestock census 1997, there were 20.97 million head of livestock in Gujarat State. In the estimates of the survey of major livestock products, during the year 2002\u201303, Gujarat produced 6.09 million tonnes of milk, 385 million eggs and 2.71 million kg of wool. Gujarat also contributes inputs to the textiles, oil, and soap industries, amongst others.\n\nThe adoption of cooperatives in Gujarat is widely attributed to much of the success in the agricultural sector, particularly sugar and dairy [[cooperative]]s. Cooperative farming has been a component of India's strategy for agricultural development since 1951. Whilst the success of these was mixed throughout the country, their positive impact on the states of [[Maharashtra]] and Gujarat have been the most significant. In 1995 alone, the two states had more registered co-operatives than any other region in the country. Out of these, the agricultural cooperatives have received much attention. Many have focused on subsidies and credit to farmers and rather than collective gathering, they have focused on facilitating collective processing and marketing of produce. However, whilst they have led to increased productivity, their effect on equity in the region has been questioned, because membership in agricultural co-operatives has tended to favour landowners whilst limiting the entry of landless agricultural labourers.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ebrahim|first=Alnoor|title=Agricultural cooperatives in Gujarat, India: Agents of equity or differentiation?|journal=Development in Practice|year=2000|volume=10|issue=2|pages=178\u2013188|doi=10.1080/09614520050010214}}</ref> An example of co-operative success in Gujarat can be illustrated through dairy co-operatives, with the particular example of [[Amul]] (Anand Milk Union Limited).\n\n[[File:Amul Plant at Anand.jpg|thumb|right|Amul Plant at Anand]]\nAmul Was formed as a dairy cooperative in 1946,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bellur |first=Venkatakrishna |author2=Saraswathi P.

As a result, Gujarat has faced problems with groundwater depletion, especially after demand for water went up in the 1960s. As access to electricity in rural areas increased, submersible electric pumps became more popular in the 1980s and 1990s. However, the Gujarat Electricity Board switched to flat tariff rates linked to the horsepower of pumps, which increased tubewell irrigation again and decreased the use of electric pumps. By the 1990s, groundwater abstraction rates exceeded groundwater recharge rate in many districts, whilst only 37.5% of all districts has \"safe\" recharge rates. Groundwater maintenance and preventing unnecessary loss of the available water supplies is now an issue faced by the state.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gulati|first=Ashok|title=Agriculture performance in Gujarat since 2000|year=2009|publisher=International Water Management Institute & International Food Policy Research Institute|page=10|url=http://www.gujaratcmfellowship.org/document/Agriculture/Agriculture%20Performance%20in%20Gujarat%20since%202000_IWMI%20&%20IFPRI%20Report-_May%202009.pdf|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221231/http://www.gujaratcmfellowship.org/document/Agriculture/Agriculture%20Performance%20in%20Gujarat%20since%202000_IWMI%20%26%20IFPRI%20Report-_May%202009.pdf|archivedate=3 March 2016}}</ref> The Sardar Sarovar Project, a debated dam project in the Narmada valley consisting of a network of canals, has significantly increased irrigation in the region. However, its impact on communities who were displaced is still a contested issue. Recently, in 2012, Gujarat began an experiment to reduce water loss due to evaporation in canals and to increase sustainability in the area by constructing solar panels over the canals. One megawatt (MW) solar power project set up at Chandrasan, Gujarat uses solar panels fixed over a 750-metre stretch of an irrigation canal. Unlike many solar power projects, this one does not take up large amounts of land since the panels are constructed over the canals, and not on additional land. This results in lower upfront costs since land does not need to be acquired, cleared or modified to set up the panels. The Chandrasan project is projected to save 9 million litres of water per year.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sharma|first=D.C.|title=India Launches Solar Power Project|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|date=June 2012|volume=10|issue=5|page=230|url=http://www.esajournals.org/userimages/ContentEditor/1338573130999/i1540-9295-10-5-full.pdf|accessdate=21 February 2013|doi=10.1890/i1540-9295-10-5-228|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924012554/http://www.esajournals.org/userimages/ContentEditor/1338573130999/i1540-9295-10-5-full.pdf|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe Government of Gujarat, to improve [[soil management]] and introduce farmers to new technology, started on a project which involved giving every farmer a [[Soil Health Card]].

The walk from the bus station to the temple is less than one kilometre, under a roofed walkway.

The Bhadrapad fair is held in the centre of the Ambaji village just outside the temple premises. The village is visited by the largest number of sanghas (pilgrim groups) during the fair. Many of them go there on foot, which is particularly enriching as it happens immediately after the monsoon, when the landscape is rich with greenery, streams are full of sparkling water and the air is fresh. About 1.5&nbsp;million devotees are known to attend this fair each year from all over the world.

Pushyagupta, a [[Vaishya]], was appointed the governor of [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] by the Mauryan regime. He ruled Girinagar (modern-day [[Junagadh]]) (322 BC to 294 BC) and built a dam on the Sudarshan lake.  Emperor [[Ashoka]], the grandson of Chandragupta Maurya, not only ordered engraving of his edicts on the rock at [[Junagadh]] but asked Governor Tusherpha to cut canals from the lake where an earlier Mauryan governor had built a dam. Between the decline of Mauryan power and Saurashtra coming under the sway of the Samprati Mauryas of [[Ujjain]], there was an [[Indo-Greek]] defeat in Gujarat of [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius]].  In 16th century manuscripts, there is an apocryphal story of a merchant of King Gondaphares landing in Gujarat with [[Apostle Thomas]].

The weather-beaten rock at Junagadh gives a glimpse of the ruler [[Rudradaman I]] (AD 100) of the Saka satraps known as [[Western Satraps]], or Kshatraps. Mahakshatrap Rudradaman I founded the Kardamaka dynasty which ruled from Anupa on the banks of the Narmada up to the Aparanta region which bordered Punjab. In Gujarat, several battles were fought between the south Indian [[Satavahana dynasty]] and the Western Satraps.\nThe greatest and the mightiest ruler of the Satavahana Dynasty was [[Gautamiputra Satakarni]] who defeated the Western Satraps and conquered some parts of Gujarat in the 2nd century AD.<ref>Trade And Trade Routes In Ancient India von Moti Chandra page: 99</ref>\n\n[[File:Gujuras of Sindh Circa AD 570-712.jpg|thumb|left|Coin of the Gujuras of [[Sindh]], [[Chavda dynasty]], circa AD 570\u2013712.

Vikramaditya's successor Skandagupta left an inscription (AD 450) on a rock at Junagadh which gives details of the governor's repairs to the embankment surrounding Sudarshan lake after it was damaged by floods. The Anarta and Saurashtra regions were both parts of the Gupta empire. Towards the middle of the 5th century, the Gupta empire went into decline. Senapati Bhatarka, the Maitraka general of the Guptas, took advantage of the situation and in 470 he set up what came to be known as the [[Maitraka]] state. He shifted his capital from Giringer to Valabhipur, near Bhavnagar, on Saurashtra's east coast. The Maitrakas of Vallabhi became very powerful with their rule prevailing over large parts of Gujarat and adjoining [[Malwa]]. A university was set up by the Maitrakas, which came to be known far and wide for its scholastic pursuits and was compared with the noted [[Nalanda university|Nalanda University]]. It was during the rule of Dhruvasena Maitrak that Chinese philosopher-traveler [[Xuanzang]]/ [[I Tsing]] visited in 640 along the [[Silk Road]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mote|first1=Sally Hovey Wriggins ; with a foreword by Frederick W.|title=Xuanzang : a Buddhist pilgrim on the Silk Road|date=1996|publisher=Westview Press|location=Boulder, Colo.|isbn=978-0-8133-2801-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RwQLAAAAYAAJ|access-date=22 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190304110046/https://books.google.com/books?id=RwQLAAAAYAAJ|archive-date=4 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nGujarat was known to the [[ancient Greeks]] and was familiar with other Western centers of civilisation through the end of the European [[Middle Ages]].

He was the third son and sixth child of [[Shah Jahan]] and [[Mumtaz Mahal]]. At the time of his birth, his father, Shah Jahan, was then the Subahdar (governor) of Gujarat, and his grandfather, [[Jehangir]], was the Mughal Emperor. Before he became emperor, Aurangzeb was made Subahdar of Gujarat subah as part of his training and was stationed at [[Ahmedabad]]. Aurangzeb was a notable expansionist and was amongst the wealthiest of the Mughal rulers, with an annual yearly tribute of \u00a338,624,680 (in 1690). During his lifetime, victories in the south expanded the Mughal Empire to more than 3.2 million square kilometres and he ruled over a population estimated as being in the range of 100\u2013150 million subjects.\n\nAurangzeb had great love for his place of birth. In 1704, he wrote a letter to his eldest son, [[Muhammad Azam Shah]], asking him to be kind and considerate to the people of Dahod as it was his birthplace.

Members of the Legislative Assembly are elected on the basis of adult suffrage from one of 182 constituencies, of which 13 are reserved for [[Scheduled Castes and Tribes|scheduled castes]] and 27 for [[scheduled tribe]]s. The term of office for a member of the Legislative Assembly is five years. The Legislative Assembly elects a speaker who presides over the meetings of the legislature. A governor is appointed by the [[President of India]], and is to address the state legislature after every general election and the commencement of each year's first session of the Legislative Assembly. The leader of the majority party or coalition in the legislature (Chief Minister) or his or her designee acts as the Leader of the Legislative Assembly. The administration of the state is led by the Chief Minister.\n\n[[File:Maganbhai Ninama, a Class IV Karma Yogi in Secretariat belonging to Adivasi community inaugurated Swarnim Sankul 2 (12534098875).jpg|thumb|right|Swarnim Sankul 2, Office of Gujarat Government]]\n\nAfter the [[independence of India]] in 1947, the [[Indian National Congress]] (INC) ruled the [[Bombay State]] (which included present-day Gujarat and [[Maharashtra]]). Congress continued to govern Gujarat after the state's creation in 1960.\n\nDuring and after India's [[The Emergency (India)|State of Emergency of 1975\u20131977]], public support for the INC eroded, but it continued to hold government until 1995 with the brief rule of nine months by [[Janata Morcha]]. In the 1995 Assembly elections, the Congress lost to the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) led by [[Keshubhai Patel]] who became the Chief Minister. His government lasted only two years. The fall of that government was provoked by a split in the BJP led by [[Shankersinh Vaghela]]. BJP again won election in 1998 with clear majority. In 2001, following the loss of two assembly seats in by-elections, Keshubhai Patel resigned and yielded power to Narendra Modi. BJP retained a majority in the 2002 election, and Narendra Modi remained as Chief Minister. On 1 June 2007, Narendra Modi became the longest serving Chief Minister of Gujarat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/raman-singh-breaks-modi-s-record-to-be-longest-serving-bjp-cm/story-5bakVFEDVU9MrSQIlDCYdK.html|title=Raman Singh breaks Modi's record to be longest serving BJP CM|date=25 July 2016|access-date=29 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170514064535/http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/raman-singh-breaks-modi-s-record-to-be-longest-serving-bjp-cm/story-5bakVFEDVU9MrSQIlDCYdK.html|archive-date=14 May 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://in.news.yahoo.com/070606/43/6gpdc.html |title= Yahoo |accessdate=7 February 2016 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Narendra-Modi-to-complete-12-years-as-Gujarats-chief-minister-tomorrow/articleshow/23610694.cms|title=Narendra Modi to complete 12 years as Gujarat's chief minister tomorrow \u2013 Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=29 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110050753/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Narendra-Modi-to-complete-12-years-as-Gujarats-chief-minister-tomorrow/articleshow/23610694.cms|archive-date=10 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> BJP retained the power in subsequent elections in 2007 and 2012 and Narendra Modi continued as the Chief Minister.

The [[Amul]] milk co-operative federation is well known all over India, and it is Asia's biggest dairy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/News/News-By-Industry/Cons-Products/Food/Amul-to-become-worlds-largest-liquid-milk-brand/articleshow/1988793.cms|title=Amul to become world's largest liquid milk brand-Food-Cons.

As per the results of livestock census 1997, there were 20.97 million head of livestock in Gujarat State. In the estimates of the survey of major livestock products, during the year 2002\u201303, Gujarat produced 6.09 million tonnes of milk, 385 million eggs and 2.71 million kg of wool. Gujarat also contributes inputs to the textiles, oil, and soap industries, amongst others.\n\nThe adoption of cooperatives in Gujarat is widely attributed to much of the success in the agricultural sector, particularly sugar and dairy [[cooperative]]s. Cooperative farming has been a component of India's strategy for agricultural development since 1951. Whilst the success of these was mixed throughout the country, their positive impact on the states of [[Maharashtra]] and Gujarat have been the most significant. In 1995 alone, the two states had more registered co-operatives than any other region in the country. Out of these, the agricultural cooperatives have received much attention. Many have focused on subsidies and credit to farmers and rather than collective gathering, they have focused on facilitating collective processing and marketing of produce. However, whilst they have led to increased productivity, their effect on equity in the region has been questioned, because membership in agricultural co-operatives has tended to favour landowners whilst limiting the entry of landless agricultural labourers.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ebrahim|first=Alnoor|title=Agricultural cooperatives in Gujarat, India: Agents of equity or differentiation?|journal=Development in Practice|year=2000|volume=10|issue=2|pages=178\u2013188|doi=10.1080/09614520050010214}}</ref> An example of co-operative success in Gujarat can be illustrated through dairy co-operatives, with the particular example of [[Amul]] (Anand Milk Union Limited).\n\n[[File:Amul Plant at Anand.jpg|thumb|right|Amul Plant at Anand]]\nAmul Was formed as a dairy cooperative in 1946,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bellur |first=Venkatakrishna |author2=Saraswathi P.

As a result, Gujarat has faced problems with groundwater depletion, especially after demand for water went up in the 1960s. As access to electricity in rural areas increased, submersible electric pumps became more popular in the 1980s and 1990s. However, the Gujarat Electricity Board switched to flat tariff rates linked to the horsepower of pumps, which increased tubewell irrigation again and decreased the use of electric pumps. By the 1990s, groundwater abstraction rates exceeded groundwater recharge rate in many districts, whilst only 37.5% of all districts has \"safe\" recharge rates. Groundwater maintenance and preventing unnecessary loss of the available water supplies is now an issue faced by the state.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gulati|first=Ashok|title=Agriculture performance in Gujarat since 2000|year=2009|publisher=International Water Management Institute & International Food Policy Research Institute|page=10|url=http://www.gujaratcmfellowship.org/document/Agriculture/Agriculture%20Performance%20in%20Gujarat%20since%202000_IWMI%20&%20IFPRI%20Report-_May%202009.pdf|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221231/http://www.gujaratcmfellowship.org/document/Agriculture/Agriculture%20Performance%20in%20Gujarat%20since%202000_IWMI%20%26%20IFPRI%20Report-_May%202009.pdf|archivedate=3 March 2016}}</ref> The Sardar Sarovar Project, a debated dam project in the Narmada valley consisting of a network of canals, has significantly increased irrigation in the region. However, its impact on communities who were displaced is still a contested issue. Recently, in 2012, Gujarat began an experiment to reduce water loss due to evaporation in canals and to increase sustainability in the area by constructing solar panels over the canals. One megawatt (MW) solar power project set up at Chandrasan, Gujarat uses solar panels fixed over a 750-metre stretch of an irrigation canal. Unlike many solar power projects, this one does not take up large amounts of land since the panels are constructed over the canals, and not on additional land. This results in lower upfront costs since land does not need to be acquired, cleared or modified to set up the panels. The Chandrasan project is projected to save 9 million litres of water per year.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sharma|first=D.C.|title=India Launches Solar Power Project|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|date=June 2012|volume=10|issue=5|page=230|url=http://www.esajournals.org/userimages/ContentEditor/1338573130999/i1540-9295-10-5-full.pdf|accessdate=21 February 2013|doi=10.1890/i1540-9295-10-5-228|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924012554/http://www.esajournals.org/userimages/ContentEditor/1338573130999/i1540-9295-10-5-full.pdf|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe Government of Gujarat, to improve [[soil management]] and introduce farmers to new technology, started on a project which involved giving every farmer a [[Soil Health Card]].

The Bhadrapad fair is held at Ambaji which is in the Danta Taluka of Banaskantha district, near the Gujarat-Rajasthan border. The walk from the bus station to the temple is less than one kilometre, under a roofed walkway. Direct buses are available from many places, including Mount Abu (45&nbsp;km away), Palanpur (65&nbsp;km away), Ahmedabad and Idar. The Bhadrapad fair is held in the centre of the Ambaji village just outside the temple premises. The village is visited by the largest number of sanghas (pilgrim groups) during the fair. Many of them go there on foot, which is particularly enriching as it happens immediately after the monsoon, when the landscape is rich with greenery, streams are full of sparkling water and the air is fresh. About 1.5&nbsp;million devotees are known to attend this fair each year from all over the world. Not only Hindus, but some devout Jains and Parsis also attend the functions, whilst some Muslims attend the fair for trade.\n\nThe [[Tarnetar]] Fair is held during the first week of ''Bhadrapad'', (September\u2013October according to [[Gregorian calendar]]), and mostly serves as a place to find a suitable bride for tribal people from Gujarat.

Other titles which had merged with ''Tammy'' before then include ''[[Sally (comics)|Sally]]'', ''[[Sandie (comics)|Sandie]]'', ''[[June (comics)|June]]'', ''[[Jinty (comics)|Jinty]]'', and ''[[Misty (comics)|Misty]]''.<ref name=FamilyTree>[http://www.comicsuk.co.uk/FamilyTree/FamilyTreeChartWhole.asp?SelectTitleBox=Tammy&Submit=Go&BView=Tree Comics UK Family Tree for ''Tammy'']{{dead link|date=June 2012}}</ref>\nThe first Editor was [[Gerry Finley-Day]], followed by Wilf Prigmore.\n\nIt consisted of a collection of many small strips, with the stories themselves normally being three or four pages long. As well as the weekly comic, [[Christmas]] [[Annual publication|annuals]] were also published. While there were similarities with its [[Fleetway]] stablemates [[Jinty (comics)|Jinty]] and [[Misty (comics)|Misty]], each comic had its own focus, with ''Tammy'' concentrating on sadder ''Cinderella''-themed stories<ref name=26pigs_Tammy>[http://www.26pigs.com/tammy/index.html 26pigs page on ''Tammy'']</ref> and dark tales of tortured heroines, most notoriously in ''Slaves of War Orphan Farm'' and ''No Tears for Molly''.  ''Tammy'''s respective merges with ''[[Misty (comics)|Misty]]'' brought darker, horror tones, and her merge with ''[[Jinty (comics)|Jinty]]'' more science-fiction. Despite these, changes in editorship brought Tammy  to a more traditional mold in storytelling during the 1980s. The dark, cruel streaks that made Tammy so revolutionary in the 1970s had disappeared, except for ''Bella Barlow''.\n\n''Tammy'' had more long-running regulars than most girls' comics due to her respective merges. The ''Tammy'' and ''[[Sandie (comics)|Sandie]]'' brought ''Wee Sue'' in 1973. The ''Tammy'' and ''[[June (comics)|June]]'' merger brought [[Bessie Bunter]] and the Storyteller with ''The Strangest Stories Ever Told'' in 1974. The ''Tammy'' and ''[[Misty (comics)|Misty]]'' merger brought ''Miss T'' and Misty herself to join the Storyteller, in 1980. The ''Tammy'' and ''[[Jinty (comics)|Jinty]]'' merger brought ''Pam of Pond Hill'' in 1981.\n\n==Creators==\n\n===Attribution===\nArtists and writers were credited in the last few years of ''Tammy'', in a move unusual for girls comics, although ''[[2000 AD (comic)|2000 AD]]'' had included credits from issue 36.\n\n===Artists===\nArtists featured in the pages of ''Tammy'' included [[John Armstrong (comics)|John Armstrong]], who drew the long-running character Bella Barlow.

Other titles which had merged with ''Tammy'' before then include ''[[Sally (comics)|Sally]]'', ''[[Sandie (comics)|Sandie]]'', ''[[June (comics)|June]]'', ''[[Jinty (comics)|Jinty]]'', and ''[[Misty (comics)|Misty]]''.<ref name=FamilyTree>[http://www.comicsuk.co.uk/FamilyTree/FamilyTreeChartWhole.asp?SelectTitleBox=Tammy&Submit=Go&BView=Tree Comics UK Family Tree for ''Tammy'']{{dead link|date=June 2012}}</ref>\nThe first Editor was [[Gerry Finley-Day]], followed by Wilf Prigmore.\n\nIt consisted of a collection of many small strips, with the stories themselves normally being three or four pages long. As well as the weekly comic, [[Christmas]] [[Annual publication|annuals]] were also published. While there were similarities with its [[Fleetway]] stablemates [[Jinty (comics)|Jinty]] and [[Misty (comics)|Misty]], each comic had its own focus, with ''Tammy'' concentrating on sadder ''Cinderella''-themed stories<ref name=26pigs_Tammy>[http://www.26pigs.com/tammy/index.html 26pigs page on ''Tammy'']</ref> and dark tales of tortured heroines, most notoriously in ''Slaves of War Orphan Farm'' and ''No Tears for Molly''.  ''Tammy'''s respective merges with ''[[Misty (comics)|Misty]]'' brought darker, horror tones, and her merge with ''[[Jinty (comics)|Jinty]]'' more science-fiction. Despite these, changes in editorship brought Tammy  to a more traditional mold in storytelling during the 1980s. The dark, cruel streaks that made Tammy so revolutionary in the 1970s had disappeared, except for ''Bella Barlow''.\n\n''Tammy'' had more long-running regulars than most girls' comics due to her respective merges. The ''Tammy'' and ''[[Sandie (comics)|Sandie]]'' brought ''Wee Sue'' in 1973. The ''Tammy'' and ''[[June (comics)|June]]'' merger brought [[Bessie Bunter]] and the Storyteller with ''The Strangest Stories Ever Told'' in 1974. The ''Tammy'' and ''[[Misty (comics)|Misty]]'' merger brought ''Miss T'' and Misty herself to join the Storyteller, in 1980. The ''Tammy'' and ''[[Jinty (comics)|Jinty]]'' merger brought ''Pam of Pond Hill'' in 1981.\n\n==Creators==\n\n===Attribution===\nArtists and writers were credited in the last few years of ''Tammy'', in a move unusual for girls comics, although ''[[2000 AD (comic)|2000 AD]]'' had included credits from issue 36.\n\n===Artists===\nArtists featured in the pages of ''Tammy'' included [[John Armstrong (comics)|John Armstrong]], who drew the long-running character Bella Barlow.

{"title_page": "As the Stomach Turns", "text_new": "'''\"As the Stomach Turns\"''' is a series of [[sketch comedy|comedy sketches]] parodying the [[soap opera]] ''[[As the World Turns]]'' (or its title, at any rate) featured on ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'', with one installment airing on ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]''. The sketch was created by show writers Kenny Solms and [[Gail Parent]].<ref>{{cite interview |last=Burnett |first=Carol |subjectlink= |interviewer=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) |title=Featurette: Fabulous Firsts |url= |date= |work=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) }}</ref> ''The Carol Burnett Show'' introduced the series during its first season in 1967\u201368 and continued to air new installments for the remainder of its 11-season run, through its final season in 1977\u201378. However, the final installment of \"As the Stomach Turns\" would not air until September 8, 1979, on a different four-week summer series titled ''Carol Burnett & Company''. This was the only installment of \"As the Stomach Turns\" that did not air on ''The Carol Burnett Show'' which had completed its run almost a year and a half earlier on March 29, 1978.\n\n==Premise==\nThe sketch's premise was to describe, in great detail, the problems of a woman in her 30s named Marion Clayton (played by [[Carol Burnett]]), who lived in the fictional town of Canoga Falls. The first installment aired on the 21st episode of the first season on February 12, 1968.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0536556|title=The Carol Burnett Show (1967\u20131978) Episode #1.21 |author= IMDB|date=|website=|accessdate=April 11, 2017}}</ref> As introduced by [[Lyle Waggoner]], it was supposed to be the final episode of a 15-year long soap opera.<ref>{{cite episode |title=022 |series=The Carol Burnett Show |network=[[CBS]] |date=February 12, 1968}}</ref>\n\nThe sketch dealt with problems that were more likely to be seen on a soap opera than in real life, although many skits were inspired by popular television shows or movies. An example of the latter was when Marion's niece Raven (played by [[Bernadette Peters]] in a guest spot) came to visit her and was possessed by a devil, Marion assumed, because Raven was such a nice girl normally. Otto Blackflag, the town exterminator, now styling himself as a freelance exorcist (played by [[Tim Conway]] and  using the same faux-Swedish dialect that he would use to play the character [[Mrs. Wiggins|Mr. Tudball]]) exorcised the demon from Raven's body. This same sort of plot was eventually done, in all seriousness, on ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' decades later.\n\nAnother movie parody saw Marion meet the bedraggled \"Richard Dryface,\" played by guest [[Steve Martin]] in a spoof of ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', complete with a grey, bulbous-headed alien played by Conway.\n\nThe sketch also touched on stereotypical aspects of production values in American soaps. Many times, Marion forgot what she wanted to say, reminiscent of the times when soap operas were broadcast live and actors routinely forgot their next line. Marion also answered the door either too soon or too late when someone rang her doorbell. Other times, she would miss the correct time to answer the phone, saying \"Hello\" before the sound effect came for it to ring. On live soap opera productions, these were big problems; due to the live nature of the show, they happened fairly frequently, and were subsequently spoofed at length on ''The Carol Burnett Show''.\n\nIn addition to the missed cues, the sketch was notorious for overusing loud and plangent [[Organ (music)|organ music]], a reference to a time when soap operas would have in-house organists play dramatic music as well as the show's theme song (when this skit first ran, organ music was still in wide use on the serials). Organ music was eventually discontinued in the mid-1970s, around the time ''The Carol Burnett Show'' wrapped up its run, so when the sketch is seen in syndication today, it brings back a sense of production technique that is now seen by many younger soap viewers as archaic and outdated.\n\nOne of the sketch's recurring characters is Marion's \"ne'er-do-well\" daughter (played by [[Vicki Lawrence]]) who arrives at the door holding a baby (a doll), usually says \"Don't you recognize me mother?

The sketch was created by show writers Kenny Solms and [[Gail Parent]].<ref>{{cite interview |last=Burnett |first=Carol |subjectlink= |interviewer=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) |title=Featurette: Fabulous Firsts |url= |date= |work=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) }}</ref> ''The Carol Burnett Show'' introduced the series during its first season in 1967\u201368 and continued to air new installments for the remainder of its 11-season run, through its final season in 1977\u201378. However, the final installment of \"As the Stomach Turns\" would not air until September 8, 1979, on a different four-week summer series titled ''Carol Burnett & Company''. This was the only installment of \"As the Stomach Turns\" that did not air on ''The Carol Burnett Show'' which had completed its run almost a year and a half earlier on March 29, 1978.\n\n==Premise==\nThe sketch's premise was to describe, in great detail, the problems of a woman in her 30s named Marion Clayton (played by [[Carol Burnett]]), who lived in the fictional town of Canoga Falls. The first installment aired on the 21st episode of the first season on February 12, 1968.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0536556|title=The Carol Burnett Show (1967\u20131978) Episode #1.21 |author= IMDB|date=|website=|accessdate=April 11, 2017}}</ref> As introduced by [[Lyle Waggoner]], it was supposed to be the final episode of a 15-year long soap opera.<ref>{{cite episode |title=022 |series=The Carol Burnett Show |network=[[CBS]] |date=February 12, 1968}}</ref>\n\nThe sketch dealt with problems that were more likely to be seen on a soap opera than in real life, although many skits were inspired by popular television shows or movies. An example of the latter was when Marion's niece Raven (played by [[Bernadette Peters]] in a guest spot) came to visit her and was possessed by a devil, Marion assumed, because Raven was such a nice girl normally. Otto Blackflag, the town exterminator, now styling himself as a freelance exorcist (played by [[Tim Conway]] and  using the same faux-Swedish dialect that he would use to play the character [[Mrs. Wiggins|Mr. Tudball]]) exorcised the demon from Raven's body. This same sort of plot was eventually done, in all seriousness, on ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' decades later.\n\nAnother movie parody saw Marion meet the bedraggled \"Richard Dryface,\" played by guest [[Steve Martin]] in a spoof of ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', complete with a grey, bulbous-headed alien played by Conway.\n\nThe sketch also touched on stereotypical aspects of production values in American soaps. Many times, Marion forgot what she wanted to say, reminiscent of the times when soap operas were broadcast live and actors routinely forgot their next line. Marion also answered the door either too soon or too late when someone rang her doorbell. Other times, she would miss the correct time to answer the phone, saying \"Hello\" before the sound effect came for it to ring. On live soap opera productions, these were big problems; due to the live nature of the show, they happened fairly frequently, and were subsequently spoofed at length on ''The Carol Burnett Show''.\n\nIn addition to the missed cues, the sketch was notorious for overusing loud and plangent [[Organ (music)|organ music]], a reference to a time when soap operas would have in-house organists play dramatic music as well as the show's theme song (when this skit first ran, organ music was still in wide use on the serials). Organ music was eventually discontinued in the mid-1970s, around the time ''The Carol Burnett Show'' wrapped up its run, so when the sketch is seen in syndication today, it brings back a sense of production technique that is now seen by many younger soap viewers as archaic and outdated.\n\nOne of the sketch's recurring characters is Marion's \"ne'er-do-well\" daughter (played by [[Vicki Lawrence]]) who arrives at the door holding a baby (a doll), usually says \"Don't you recognize me mother? I'm your daughter,\" then leaves after giving the baby to Marion who immediately stashes it in the umbrella stand.<ref name=\"emmytvlegends.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#|title=Vicki Lawrence|work=Archive of American Television|accessdate=1 December 2016}}</ref> This was a parody of the fact that traditional soap operas have little use for child characters, either dropping them from the plot line shortly after they are introduced or [[Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome|unnaturally aging]] them into adulthood or, more recently, into the teenage years (for example, a young character might be sent upstairs to put on his or her shoes and never be referred to again).\n\nThe sketch also marks the first appearances of [[Harvey Korman]]'s Mother Marcus character, who had also become a recurring resident of Canoga Falls, as well as [[Tim Conway]]'s [[The Oldest Man (character)|oldest man character]], who within the confines of the series played several characters, including Marion's grandfather, her Uncle Waldo, insurance agent Duane Toddleberry, and obscene phone caller Marvin Peterson, Jr.<ref>{{cite interview |last=Burnett |first=Carol |subjectlink= |interviewer=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) |title=Featurette: Fabulous Firsts |url= |date= |work=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) }}</ref>\n\nThe sketch was famous for the parody ending in which the announcer would ask foreboding, progressively nonsensical questions about the characters while focusing on their puzzled reactions.\n\n==Trivia==\n* In her 1996 memoir, \"As My World Still Turns\", actress [[Eileen Fulton]], who has starred on the [[CBS]] soap ''[[As the World Turns]]'' for over four decades, claimed credit for coming up with the concept for \"As the Stomach Turns\".
