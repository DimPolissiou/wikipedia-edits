The team currently plays in the {{English football updater|WalthamA}}.\n\n==History==\n'''Waltham Abbey Youth Club''', based in [[Waltham Abbey (town)|Waltham Abbey]], first played football at \u201cCapershotts\u201d during the [[Second World War]] and in later years the club became known as firstly Waltham Abbey, then '''Abbey Sports'''. Both clubs gained numerous honours in the Northern Suburban League.\n\nThe club was founded in 1944 with a mix of players from Waltham Abbey Youth Club and former juniors from Tottenham Hotspur under the leadership of the trainer and manager Wally Hickman. The secretary was Mo (Maurice) Ward. The President was Capt. Larkin.\n\nIn their early years they played to a high standard and reached the final of the Herts Junior Cup in three years out of four but lost on each occasion \u2013 including a loss to Redbourn Rovers of 4\u20135 after they had been leading 4\u20131.\n\nSome of the leading players in the early years included left winger Dave Cook who was killed in a road crash, centre-half Robbo Robinson and inside forward Frank Blower. Frank later became a dedicated treasurer of the club with Ray Buck as a similarly dedicated club secretary.\n\n'''Waltham Abbey United''' emerged in the late sixties and a new clubhouse was built. In 1974 the club amalgamated with the successful Beechfield Sports and joined the Metropolitan League, which later became the London Spartan League.\n\nIn 1976 the club won the Essex Junior Cup beating Maldon St Mary's 1-0 at Grays Athletics ground.  Alfie Hall was the goalscorer. Later that summer the club dropped the Beechfield Sports tag on the advice of [[The FA]]. Two years later the club reached the final of the Essex Intermediate Cup (losing 1-2 to Dagenham Reserves at Epping Town FC) and won the league's Division One title, and, having gained Senior Status, were promoted. In their first season they won the title without losing a game and were again promoted this time to the Premier Division where they remained until season 2000\u201301.\n\nIn 1990\u201391 the club were inaugural finalists in the Roy Bailey Memorial Trophy, a competition for local teams including [[Cheshunt F.C.|Cheshunt]], [[Ware F.C.|Ware]], and [[Hertford Town F.C.|Hertford Town]].\n\nIt was won for the first time in 1994\u201395 when they beat [[Hoddesdon Town F.C.|Hoddesdon Town]]. In both 1996\u201397 and 2005 (in the final held over from the previous season) they beat [[St Margaretsbury F.C.|St Margaretsbury]].\n\nIn 1998\u201399 they won the [[London Senior Cup]] with a fine 3\u20132 win over [[Bedfont]] at [[Dulwich Hamlet]]\u2019s ground, Dean Green securing a hat trick to win the cup. They also secured the Spartan South Midlands Challenge Trophy beating Holmer Green 3-0 over two legs.\n\nRecent seasons have seen a lot of changes on and off the pitch with floodlights being installed in 1990 and the ground levelled. A great amount of work has been done around the clubhouse and a 200-seater stand built. A number of seats were purchased from [[Maine Road]] and these were installed during the summer of 2005 as the club strived to improve facilities on and off the field and move up the non-league pyramid.\n\nSeason 2001\u201302 was spent in the Essex & Herts Border Combination to allow them to move across the pyramid. They were elected to the [[Essex Senior Football League|Essex Senior League]] for season 2002\u201303. In 2004\u201305, in addition to winning both the League Cup and the Gordon Brasted Memorial Trophy they finished in their highest position of 2nd.\n\nOn 2 May 2009, the Abbott's capped off a successful 2008\u201309 season by beating Concord Rangers 5\u20134 on penalties, after a 1\u20131 draw, to win the Isthmian League Division 1 North Play-offs. They played in the Isthmian League Premier Division for the first time in their history in 2009\u201310. However, despite winning the last two games of their season, they finished 21st and were relegated for the first time in the club's history. After 7 seasons in North Division a league restructure saw the club have been moved into the newly formed Isthmian League South Central League.\nFamous for their low ball transfer offers for some of the All time greats such as Alan shearer when he was in his prime at Newcastle United F.C, they offered the 15 year old Matt tyler from Waltham Abbey F.C along with the fee of \u00a318,000 which was the seasons budget. They also tried to sign Ryan shawcross back in 2015 for a fee of only \u00a3100,000.\n\n==Honours==\n\n*''' FA cup \n** FA CUP finalists 2015 \n**Runners Up 1972-73\n*'''[[Middlesex Senior Charity Cup Final]]'''\n**Runners Up 1997-98\n*'''[[London Senior Cup]]'''\n**Winners 1998-99\n*'''[[Essex Senior League Cup]]'''\n**Winners 2004-05\n*'''[[Gordon Brasted Memorial Trophy]]'''\n**Winners 2004-05\n*'''[[Middlesex Millenium Cup]]'''\n**Winners 2004-05\n*'''[[Roy Bailey Memorial Trophy]]'''\n**Winners 1994-95\n**Winners 1996-97\n**Runners Up 1990-91\n\n==Records==\n*'''[[FA Cup]]'''<ref name=\"FCHD\">{{Fchd|id=WALTHAAB|name=Waltham Abbey}}</ref>\n**Third Qualifying Round 2014-15\n*'''[[FA Trophy]]'''\n**First Qualifying Round 2006\u201307, 2009\u201310, 2012\u201313, 2013-14\n*'''[[FA Vase]]'''\n**Second Round 1997\u201398\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/walthamabbeysenior Waltham Abbey F.C.

An agreement was quickly reached on Hitler's terms. It was signed by the top leaders of Germany, France, Britain, and Italy. Militarily, the Sudetenland was of strategic importance to Czechoslovakia as most of its border defenses were situated there to protect against a German attack. The agreement between the four powers was signed on the backdrop of a low-intensity undeclared German-Czechoslovak war that had started on 17 September 1938.

The [[Treaty of Versailles]] recognized the independence of Czechoslovakia with a population that included three million German-speaking people, 24 percent of the total population of the country. The Germans lived mostly in border regions of the historical Czech lands of Bohemia and Moravia for which they coined the new name [[Sudetenland]], bordering on [[Germany]] and the newly created country of [[Austria]]. They arrived to the Czech lands in every century, including many since 1850.\nThe Sudeten Germans were not consulted about whether they wished to be citizens of Czechoslovakia. Although the constitution guaranteed equality for all citizens, there was a tendency among political leaders to transform the country \"into an instrument of Czech and Slovak nationalism\".<ref>Douglas, R. M. (2012), ''Orderly and Humane'', New Haven: Yale University Press, p. 9</ref> Some progress was made to integrate the Germans and other minorities, but they continued to be under-represented in the government and the army.  Moreover, the [[Great Depression]] beginning in 1929 impacted the highly industrialized and export-oriented Sudeten Germans more than it did the Czech and Slovak populations.  By 1936, 60 percent of the unemployed people in Czechoslovakia were Germans.<ref>Douglas, pp. 7-12</ref>\n\nIn 1933 Sudeten German leader [[Konrad Henlein]] founded the [[Sudeten German Party]] (SdP) which was \"militant, populist, and openly hostile\" to the Czechoslovakian government and soon captured two-thirds of the vote in districts with a heavy German population. Historians differ as to whether the SdP was from its beginning a Nazi [[front organization]], or evolved into one.<ref name=\"Eleanor L. Turk 1999. Pp. 123\">Eleanor L. Turk.

The French government did not wish to face Germany alone and took its lead from Britain's [[British Conservative Party|Conservative]] government of Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]]. Chamberlain considered the Sudeten German grievances justified and believed Hitler's intentions were limited. Both Britain and France, therefore, advised Czechoslovakia to accede to Germany's demands.

After being pressed by Chamberlain, Hitler agreed to have the ultimatum set for 1 October (the same date that [[Fall Gr\u00fcn (Czechoslovakia)|Operation Green]] was set to begin).<ref name=\"Santi Corvaja 2008.

The Czechoslovak army, modern, experienced and possessing an excellent [[Czechoslovak border fortifications|system of frontier fortifications]], was prepared to fight. The [[Soviet Union]] announced its willingness to come to Czechoslovakia's assistance,  provided that the Soviet Army would be able to cross Polish and Romanian territory.

The memorandum also stated that if Czechoslovakia did not agree to the German demands by 2 pm on 28 September, Germany would take the Sudetenland by force. On the same day, Chamberlain returned to Britain and announced that Hitler demanded the annexation of the Sudetenland without delay.<ref name=\"Santi Corvaja 2008.

The agreement was officially introduced by Mussolini although in fact the Italian plan was nearly identical to the Godesberg proposal: the German army was to complete the [[occupation of the Sudetenland]] by 10 October, and an international commission would decide the future of other disputed areas.\n\nCzechoslovakia was informed by Britain and France that it could either resist Nazi Germany alone or submit to the prescribed annexations. The Czechoslovak government, realizing the hopelessness of fighting the Nazis alone, reluctantly capitulated (30 September) and agreed to abide by the agreement. The settlement gave Germany the Sudetenland starting 10 October, and ''de facto'' control over the rest of Czechoslovakia as long as Hitler promised to go no further. On 30 September after some rest, Chamberlain went to Hitler and asked him to sign a peace treaty between the United Kingdom and Germany. After Hitler's interpreter translated it for him, he happily agreed.\n\nOn 30 September, upon his return to Britain, Chamberlain delivered his controversial \"[[peace for our time]]\" speech to crowds in London.<ref>http://www.britannia.com/history/docs/peacetime.html</ref>\n[[File:The F\u00fchrerbau.jpg|thumb|The F\u00fchrerbau in Munich, site of the Munich Agreement]]\n[[File:Hitler's Office in the F\u00fchrerbau.jpg|thumb|Present-day view of Hitler's office in the F\u00fchrerbau where the Munich Agreement was signed, with the original fireplace and ceiling lamp]]\n\n==Reactions==\n[[File:\u010ce\u0161i vyhnan\u00ed z pohrani\u010d\u00ed hledaj\u00ed nov\u00fd domov.jpg|thumb|Czechs expelled from the border looking for a new home, October 1938]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1976-033-20, Anschluss sudetendeutscher Gebiete.jpg|thumb|Sudeten Germans cheering the arrival of the German Army into the Sudetenland in October 1938]]\n\nThough the British and French were pleased, a British diplomat in Berlin claimed he had been informed by a member of Hitler's entourage that soon after the meeting with Chamberlain Hitler had furiously said: \"Gentlemen, this has been my first international conference and I can assure you that it will be my last\".{{sfn|Sir Ivone Kirkpatrick|1959|p=135}} On another occasion, he had been heard saying of Chamberlain: \"If ever that silly old man comes interfering here again with his umbrella, I'll kick him downstairs and jump on his stomach in front of the photographers.\"{{sfn|Sir Ivone Kirkpatrick|1959|p=135}}<ref name=\"Overy\">[[Richard Overy]], 'Germany, \"Domestic Crisis\" and War in 1939', ''Past & Present'' No. 116 (Aug., 1987), p. 163, n. 74.</ref><ref>Robert Rothschild, ''Peace For Our Time'' (Brassey's Defence Publishers, 1988), p. 279.</ref> In one of his public speeches after Munich, Hitler declared: \"Thank God we have no umbrella politicians in this country\".{{sfn|Sir Ivone Kirkpatrick|1959|p=135}}<ref name=\"Overy\"/><ref>Roger Parkinson, ''Peace For Our Time: Munich to Dunkirk\u2014The Inside Story'' (London: Hart-Davis, 1971), p. 78.</ref>\n\nHitler felt cheated of the limited war against the Czechs which he had been aiming for all summer.<ref>Ian Kershaw, ''Hitler, 1936\u20131945: Nemesis'' (London: Penguin, 2001), pp. 122\u2013123.</ref> In early October, Chamberlain's press secretary asked for a public declaration of German friendship with Britain to strengthen Chamberlain's domestic position; Hitler instead delivered speeches denouncing Chamberlain's \"governessy interference\".<ref>Robert Self, ''Neville Chamberlain'' (London: Routledge, 2006), p. 344.</ref> In August 1939, shortly before the invasion of Poland, Hitler told his generals: \"Our enemies are men below average, not men of action, not masters.

Stalin concluded that the West had actively colluded with Hitler to hand over a [[Central Europe]]an country to the Nazis, causing concern that they might do the same to the Soviet Union in the future, allowing the partition of the USSR between the western powers and the fascist [[Axis powers|Axis]]. This belief led the Soviet Union to reorient its foreign policy towards a [[rapprochement]] with Germany, which eventually led to the signing of the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] in 1939.{{sfn|Klaus Hildebrand|1991}}\n\nThe Nobel laureate, [[Thomas Mann]], took to both pen and pulpit in defense of his surrogate homeland proclaiming his pride at being a Czechoslovak citizen and praising the republic's achievements.<br> He attacked a \"Europe ready for slavery\" writing that \"The Czechoslovak people is ready to take up a fight for liberty and transcends its own fate\" and \"It is too late for the British government to save the peace.

They were not invited to the conference, and felt they had been betrayed by the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]]. [[Czechs]] and [[Slovaks]] call the Munich Agreement the '''Munich [[Diktat]]''' ({{lang-cs|Mnichovsk\u00fd dikt\u00e1t}}; {{lang-sk|Mn\u00edchovsk\u00fd dikt\u00e1t}}). The phrase \"[[Western betrayal|Munich Betrayal]]\" ({{lang-cs|Mnichovsk\u00e1 zrada}}; {{lang-sk|Mn\u00edchovsk\u00e1 zrada}}) is also used because the military alliance Czechoslovakia had with France proved useless. This was also reflected by the fact that especially the French Government had expressed the view that Czechoslovakia would be considered as being responsible for any resulting European war should the Czechoslovak Republic defend herself with arms against Germany.{{sfn|Jan Kuklik| The validity of the Munich agreement and the process of the repudiation during the second world war as seen from a Czechoslovak perspective|p=346}} <br>\n\nBritain and France signed away the territorial integrity of a sovereign state and maneuvered Prague into the position of a defeated power.<br>\nBeing presented with ultimatums from friends and enemies the Democratic Czechoslovak Government had no other alternative than to accept the dictate under protest. <br> In 1938 Soviet Union was allied with France and Czechoslovakia.

Without them its independence became more nominal than real. Czechoslovakia also lost 70% of its iron/steel industry, 70% of its electrical power and 3.5 million citizens to Germany as a result of the settlement.{{sfn|Shirer, William L.|1960}}\nThe Sudeten Germans celebrated what they saw as their liberation. The imminent war, it seemed, had been avoided.\n\nBefore the Munich Agreement, Hitler's determination to invade Czechoslovakia on 1 October 1938 had provoked a major crisis in the German command structure. The Chief of the General Staff, General [[Ludwig Beck]], protested in a lengthy series of memos that it would start a world war that Germany would lose, and urged Hitler to put off the projected war. Hitler called Beck's arguments against war \"''kindische Kr\u00e4fteberechnungen''\" (\"childish force calculations\"). On 4 August 1938, a secret Army meeting was held. Beck read his lengthy report to the assembled officers. They all agreed something had to be done to prevent certain disaster. Beck hoped they would all resign together but no one resigned except Beck. His replacement, General [[Franz Halder]], sympathised with Beck and they both conspired with several top generals, Admiral [[Wilhelm Canaris]] (Chief of German Intelligence), and [[Wolf-Heinrich Graf von Helldorf|Graf von Helldorf]] (Berlin's Police Chief) to arrest Hitler the moment he gave the invasion order. This plan would only work if Britain issued a strong warning and a letter to the effect that they would fight to preserve Czechoslovakia. This would help to convince the German people that certain defeat awaited Germany. Agents were therefore sent to England to tell Chamberlain that an attack on Czechoslovakia was planned, and of their intention to overthrow Hitler if this occurred. The proposal was rejected by the British Cabinet and no such letter was issued. Accordingly, the proposed removal of Hitler did not go ahead.{{sfn|Terry Parssinen|2004}} On this basis it has been argued that the Munich Agreement kept Hitler in power, although whether it would have been any more successful than the [[20 July plot|1944 plot]] is doubtful.\n[[File:Sudetenland Reichsgau 1944.png|thumb|Map of the Sudetenland [[Reichsgau]]]]\n\n===Opinions about the agreement===\nThe British population had expected imminent war and the \"statesman-like gesture\" of Chamberlain was at first greeted with acclaim. Chamberlain was greeted as a hero by the royal family and invited on the balcony at [[Buckingham Palace]] before he had presented the agreement to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]. The generally positive reaction quickly soured despite royal patronage. But there was opposition from the start; [[Clement Attlee]] and the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] opposed the agreement, in alliance with two Conservative MPs, [[Duff Cooper]] and [[Vyvyan Adams]], who had been seen up to then as a [[die hard (phrase)|die hard]] and reactionary element in the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].\n\nAs the threat of Germany and a European war became more evident, opinions changed. Chamberlain was excoriated for his role as one of the \"Men of Munich\", in books such as the 1940 ''[[Guilty Men]]''. A rare wartime defence of the Munich Agreement came in 1944 from [[Frederic Maugham, 1st Viscount Maugham|Viscount Maugham]], who had been Lord Chancellor at the time. Maugham viewed the decision to establish a Czechoslovak state including substantial German and Hungarian minorities as a \"dangerous experiment\" in the light of previous disputes and ascribed the Munich Agreement largely to France's need to extricate itself from its treaty obligations in the light of its unpreparedness for war.{{sfn|Viscount Maugham|1944}} After the war, Churchill's memoir of the period, ''The Gathering Storm'' (1948), asserted that Chamberlain's appeasement of Hitler at Munich had been wrong, and recorded Churchill's pre-war warnings of Hitler's plan of aggression and the folly of Britain's persisting with disarmament after Germany had achieved air parity with Britain. Although Churchill recognized that Chamberlain acted from noble motives, he argued that Hitler should have been resisted over Czechoslovakia and that efforts should have been made to involve the Soviet Union on their side.\nIn his [[The Second World War (book series)|postwar memoirs]], [[Winston Churchill]], a staunch opponent of appeasement, lumped [[Poland]] and [[Hungary]], both of which subsequently annexed parts of Czechoslovakia containing Polish and Hungarian nationals, with Germany as \"vultures upon the carcass of Czechoslovakia.\"<ref name=\"Winston S.

He told the British in a late April 1938 meeting that Hitler's real aim was to eventually secure \"a domination of the Continent in comparison with which the ambitions of Napoleon were feeble.\" He went on to say: \"Today it is the turn of Czechoslovakia. Tomorrow it will be the turn of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]]. When Germany has obtained the oil and wheat it needs, she will turn on the West. Certainly we must multiply our efforts to avoid war. But that will not be obtained unless Great Britain and France stick together, intervening in Prague for new concessions but declaring at the same time that they will safeguard the independence of Czechoslovakia. If, on the contrary, the Western Powers capitulate again they will only precipitate the war they wish to avoid.\"{{sfn|Shirer, William L.|1969|p=339\u2013340}} Perhaps discouraged by the arguments of the military and civilian members of the French government regarding their unprepared military and weak financial situation, as well as traumatised by France's bloodbath in the First World War that he was personally a witness to, Daladier ultimately let Chamberlain have his way.

About a half million Sudeten Germans joined the Nazi Party which was 17.34% of the German population in Sudetenland (the average NSDAP participation in Nazi Germany was 7.85%). This means the Sudetenland was the most \"pro-Nazi\" region in the Third Reich.{{sfn|Zimmermann, Volker|1999|p=}}\n\nBecause of their knowledge of the Czech language, many Sudeten Germans were employed in the administration of the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] as well as in Nazi organizations ([[Gestapo]], etc.). The most notable was [[Karl Hermann Frank]]: the SS and Police general and Secretary of State in the Protectorate.\n\n====German invasion of the remainder of Czechoslovakia====\n{{main|German occupation of Czechoslovakia}}\n\nIn 1937, the [[Wehrmacht]] had formulated a plan called \"Operation Green\" ([[Fall Gr\u00fcn (Czechoslovakia)|''Fall Gr\u00fcn'']]) for the invasion of Czechoslovakia{{sfn|Herzstein, Robert Edwin|1980|p=184}} which was practically implemented after the proclamation of the [[Slovak Republic (1939-1945)|Slovak State]] on 15 March 1939.\n\nOn 14 March Slovakia seceded from Czechoslovakia and became a separate pro-Nazi state. On the following day, [[Carpatho-Ukraine]] proclaimed independence as well, but after three days was completely occupied and annexed by Hungary. Czechoslovak president [[Emil H\u00e1cha]] traveled to Berlin and was left waiting, while orders to invade were already given. During the meeting with Adolf Hitler,  H\u00e1cha was threatened with the bombing of Prague if he refused to order Czech troops to lay down their arms. This induced a heart attack, from which he was revived by an injection from Hitler's doctor. He then agreed to sign the communique accepting the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|German occupation]] of the remainder of Bohemia and Moravia \"which in its unctuous mendacity was remarkable even for the Nazis\".<ref>Noakes, J. and Pridham, G. (eds) (2010) [2001] Nazism 1919-1945, Vol 3, Foreign Policy, War and Racial Extermination, University of Exeter Press, Exeter, p.119</ref>  Churchill's prediction was fulfilled as German armies entered [[Prague]] and proceeded to occupy the rest of the country, which was transformed into a [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|protectorate of the Reich]]. In March 1939, [[Konstantin von Neurath|Neurath]] was appointed as Reichsprotektor, serving as Hitler's personal representative in the protectorate. Immediately after the occupation, a wave of arrests began, mostly of refugees from Germany, Jews and Czech public figures. By November, Jewish children had been expelled from their schools and their parents fired from their jobs.\nUniversities and colleges were closed after demonstrations against the occupation of Czechoslovakia. Over 1200 students were sent to concentration camps and nine student leaders were executed on 17th of November (The international Students' Day).\n\nBy seizing Bohemia and Moravia the [[Third Reich]] gained all the skilled labour force and heavy industry placed there as well as all the weapons of the Czechoslovak army. At the time of Hitler's later attack on France, roughly 25% of all German weapons came from the protectorate B\u00f6hmen und M\u00e4hren. The Third Reich also gained the whole Czechoslovak gold treasure, including gold stored in the [[Bank of England]]. Of a total 227 tons of gold found after the war in salt mines, only 18.4 tons were returned to Czechoslovakia in 1982, although most of this gold came from Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovakia was also forced to \"sell\" to the [[Wehrmacht]] war material for 648 million of pre-war [[Czechoslovak koruna|Czechoslovak crowns]]. This debt was never repaid.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nGermans even took the precaution of sending their troops over borders as early as the afternoon of 14 March, causing an incident between 13th (Silesian) Czechoslovak Battalion and the 8th Infantry Division of the Nazi army in M\u00edstek. After a while the Germans decided to pull out as the escalation could endanger \"peaceful\" takeover.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2004-1202-505, Prag, Burg, Besuch Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|Adolf Hitler on his visit to [[Prague Castle]] after the establishment of a German [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|protectorate]], 15 March 1939]]\nChamberlain<ref>McDonough, 2002, p.73</ref> claimed the Prague annexation was a \"completely different category\", moving [[Second Thirty Years War#The move beyond legitimate Versailles grievances, 1938-9|beyond the legitimate Versailles grievances]].\n\nMeanwhile, concerns arose in Great Britain that Poland (now substantially encircled by German possessions) would become the next target of Nazi expansionism, which was made apparent by the dispute over the [[Polish Corridor]] and the [[Free City of Danzig]]. This resulted in the signing of an [[Anglo-Polish military alliance]], and the consequent refusal of the Polish government to accept German negotiation proposals over the Polish Corridor and the status of Danzig.\n\nPrime Minister Chamberlain felt betrayed by the Nazi seizure of Czechoslovakia, realizing his policy of appeasement towards Hitler had failed, and began to take a much harder line against the Nazis. Amongst other things he immediately began to mobilize the British Empire's armed forces to a war footing. France did the same. Italy saw itself threatened by the British and French fleets and started its own [[Italian invasion of Albania|invasion of Albania]] in April 1939. Although no immediate action followed, Hitler's [[invasion of Poland]] on 1 September officially began [[World War II]].\n\nSignificant industrial potential and military equipment of the former Czechoslovakia had been efficiently absorbed into the [[Third Reich]].\n\n====Strengthening of Wehrmacht's armament====\nSince most of the border defenses were located in the territory ceded as a consequence of the Munich Agreement, the remaining part of Czechoslovakia was entirely open to further invasion, despite having relatively large stockpiles of modern weaponry. In a speech delivered in the Reichstag, Hitler expressed the importance of the occupation for strengthening of German military, noting that by occupying Czechoslovakia, Germany gained 2,175 field guns and cannons, 469 tanks, 500 anti-aircraft artillery pieces, 43,000 machine guns, 1,090,000 military rifles, 114,000 pistols, about a billion rounds of small-arms ammunition and three million rounds of anti-aircraft ammunition. This amount of weaponry would be sufficient to arm about half of the then Wehrmacht.<ref>{{Citation\n| last1  = Motl\n| first1 = Stanislav\n| lastauthoramp = yes\n| title     = Kam zmizel zlat\u00fd poklad republiky\n| publisher = Rybka publishers\n| place     = Prague\n| edition = 2nd\n| year    = 2007\n}}</ref> Czechoslovak weaponry later played major part in the German conquest of Poland and France, the latter country having urged Czechoslovakia to surrender to Germany in 1938.\n\n====Birth of German resistance within the military====\n{{main|Oster Conspiracy}}\n\nIn Germany the Sudeten crisis led to the so-called [[Oster Conspiracy]]. General [[Hans Oster]], deputy head of the ''[[Abwehr]]'', and prominent figures within the German military who opposed the regime for its behaviour that was threatening to bring Germany into a war that they believed it was not ready to fight, discussed overthrowing Hitler and the Nazi regime through a planned storming of the [[Reich Chancellery]] by forces loyal to the plot.\n\n====Italian colonial demands from France====\n{{Main|France\u2013Italy relations}}\nItaly strongly supported Germany at Munich and a few weeks later in October 1938 it tried to use its advantage to make new demands on France. Mussolini demanded: a [[List of free ports|free port]] at Djibouti, control of the Addis Ababa-Djibouti railroad, Italian participation in the management of [[Suez Canal Company]], some form of French-Italian [[Condominium (international law)|condominium]] over Tunisia, and the preservation of Italian culture in French-held Corsica with no French assimilation of the people.

I explained that this decision implied that His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom regarded the juridical position of the President and Government of the Czecho-Slovak Republic as identical with that of the other Allied heads of States and Governments established in this country. The status of His Majesty's representative has recently been raised to that of an Ambassador.\n\nThe Prime Minister had already stated in a message broadcast to the Czecho-Slovak people on the 30th September, 1940, the attitude of His Majesty's Government in regard to the arrangements reached at Munich in 1938. Mr. Churchill then said that the Munich Agreement had been destroyed by the Germans. This statement was formally communicated to Dr. Bene\u0161 on the 11th November, 1940.\n\nThe foregoing statement and formal act of recognition have guided the policy of His Majesty's Government in regard to Czecho-Slovakia, but in order to avoid any possible misunderstanding, I desire to declare on behalf of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom that as Germany has deliberately destroyed the arrangements concerning Czecho-Slovakia reached in 1938, in which His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom participated, His Majesty's Government regard themselves as free from any engagements in this respect. At the final settlement of the Czecho-Slovak frontiers to be reached at the end of the war they will not be influenced by any changes effected in and since 1938.}}\n\nTo which Masaryk replied as follows:\n\n{{quote|I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your note of the 5th August, 1942, and I avail myself of this opportunity to convey to your Excellency, on behalf of the Czecho-Slovak Government and of myself, as well as in the name of the whole Czecho-Slovak people who are at present suffering so terribly under the Nazi yoke, the expression of our warmest thanks.\n\nYour Excellency's note emphasises the fact that the formal act of recognition has guided the policy of His Majesty's Government in regard to Czecho-Slovakia, but, in order to avoid any possible misunderstanding, His Majesty's Government now desire to declare that, as Germany has deliberately destroyed the arrangements concerning Czecho-Slovakia reached in 1938, in which His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom participated, His Majesty's Government regard themselves as free from any engagements in this respect. At the final settlement of the Czecho-Slovak frontiers to be reached at the end of the war, they will not be influenced by any changes effected in and since 1938.\n\nMy Government accept your Excellency's note as a practical solution of the questions and difficulties of vital importance for Czecho-Slovakia which emerged between our two countries as the consequence of the Munich Agreement, maintaining, of course, our political and juridical position with regard to the Munich Agreement and the events which followed it as expressed in the note of the Czecho-Slovak Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the 16th December, 1941.

An agreement was quickly reached on Hitler's terms. It was signed by the top leaders of Germany, France, Britain, and Italy. Militarily, the Sudetenland was of strategic importance to Czechoslovakia as most of its border defenses were situated there to protect against a German attack. The agreement between the four powers was signed on the backdrop of a low-intensity undeclared German-Czechoslovak war that had started on 17 September 1938.

The [[Treaty of Versailles]] recognized the independence of Czechoslovakia with a population that included three million German-speaking people, 24 percent of the total population of the country. The Germans lived mostly in border regions of the historical Czech lands of Bohemia and Moravia for which they coined the new name [[Sudetenland]], bordering on [[Germany]] and the newly created country of [[Austria]]. They arrived to the Czech lands in every century, including many since 1850.\nThe Sudeten Germans were not consulted about whether they wished to be citizens of Czechoslovakia. Although the constitution guaranteed equality for all citizens, there was a tendency among political leaders to transform the country \"into an instrument of Czech and Slovak nationalism\".<ref>Douglas, R. M. (2012), ''Orderly and Humane'', New Haven: Yale University Press, p. 9</ref> Some progress was made to integrate the Germans and other minorities, but they continued to be under-represented in the government and the army.  Moreover, the [[Great Depression]] beginning in 1929 impacted the highly industrialized and export-oriented Sudeten Germans more than it did the Czech and Slovak populations.  By 1936, 60 percent of the unemployed people in Czechoslovakia were Germans.<ref>Douglas, pp. 7-12</ref>\n\nIn 1933 Sudeten German leader [[Konrad Henlein]] founded the [[Sudeten German Party]] (SdP) which was \"militant, populist, and openly hostile\" to the Czechoslovakian government and soon captured two-thirds of the vote in districts with a heavy German population.

The agreement was officially introduced by Mussolini although in fact the Italian plan was nearly identical to the Godesberg proposal: the German army was to complete the [[occupation of the Sudetenland]] by 10 October, and an international commission would decide the future of other disputed areas.\n\nCzechoslovakia was informed by Britain and France that it could either resist Nazi Germany alone or submit to the prescribed annexations. The Czechoslovak government, realizing the hopelessness of fighting the Nazis alone, reluctantly capitulated (30 September) and agreed to abide by the agreement. The settlement gave Germany the Sudetenland starting 10 October, and ''de facto'' control over the rest of Czechoslovakia as long as Hitler promised to go no further. On 30 September after some rest, Chamberlain went to Hitler and asked him to sign a peace treaty between the United Kingdom and Germany. After Hitler's interpreter translated it for him, he happily agreed.\n\nOn 30 September, upon his return to Britain, Chamberlain delivered his controversial \"[[peace for our time]]\" speech to crowds in London.<ref>http://www.britannia.com/history/docs/peacetime.html</ref>\n[[File:The F\u00fchrerbau.jpg|thumb|The F\u00fchrerbau in Munich, site of the Munich Agreement]]\n[[File:Hitler's Office in the F\u00fchrerbau.jpg|thumb|Present-day view of Hitler's office in the F\u00fchrerbau where the Munich Agreement was signed, with the original fireplace and ceiling lamp]]\n\n==Reactions==\n[[File:\u010ce\u0161i vyhnan\u00ed z pohrani\u010d\u00ed hledaj\u00ed nov\u00fd domov.jpg|thumb|Czechs expelled from the border looking for a new home, October 1938]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1976-033-20, Anschluss sudetendeutscher Gebiete.jpg|thumb|Sudeten Germans cheering the arrival of the German Army into the Sudetenland in October 1938]]\n\nThough the British and French were pleased, a British diplomat in Berlin claimed he had been informed by a member of Hitler's entourage that soon after the meeting with Chamberlain Hitler had furiously said: \"Gentlemen, this has been my first international conference and I can assure you that it will be my last\".{{sfn|Sir Ivone Kirkpatrick|1959|p=135}} On another occasion, he had been heard saying of Chamberlain: \"If ever that silly old man comes interfering here again with his umbrella, I'll kick him downstairs and jump on his stomach in front of the photographers.\"{{sfn|Sir Ivone Kirkpatrick|1959|p=135}}<ref name=\"Overy\">[[Richard Overy]], 'Germany, \"Domestic Crisis\" and War in 1939', ''Past & Present'' No. 116 (Aug., 1987), p. 163, n. 74.</ref><ref>Robert Rothschild, ''Peace For Our Time'' (Brassey's Defence Publishers, 1988), p. 279.</ref> In one of his public speeches after Munich, Hitler declared: \"Thank God we have no umbrella politicians in this country\".{{sfn|Sir Ivone Kirkpatrick|1959|p=135}}<ref name=\"Overy\"/><ref>Roger Parkinson, ''Peace For Our Time: Munich to Dunkirk\u2014The Inside Story'' (London: Hart-Davis, 1971), p. 78.</ref>\n\nHitler felt cheated of the limited war against the Czechs which he had been aiming for all summer.<ref>Ian Kershaw, ''Hitler, 1936\u20131945: Nemesis'' (London: Penguin, 2001), pp. 122\u2013123.</ref> In early October, Chamberlain's press secretary asked for a public declaration of German friendship with Britain to strengthen Chamberlain's domestic position; Hitler instead delivered speeches denouncing Chamberlain's \"governessy interference\".<ref>Robert Self, ''Neville Chamberlain'' (London: Routledge, 2006), p. 344.</ref> In August 1939, shortly before the invasion of Poland, Hitler told his generals: \"Our enemies are men below average, not men of action, not masters.

Stalin concluded that the West had actively colluded with Hitler to hand over a [[Central Europe]]an country to the Nazis, causing concern that they might do the same to the Soviet Union in the future, allowing the partition of the USSR between the western powers and the fascist [[Axis powers|Axis]]. This belief led the Soviet Union to reorient its foreign policy towards a [[rapprochement]] with Germany, which eventually led to the signing of the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] in 1939.{{sfn|Klaus Hildebrand|1991}}\n\nThe Nobel laureate, [[Thomas Mann]], took to both pen and pulpit in defense of his surrogate homeland proclaiming his pride at being a Czechoslovak citizen and praising the republic's achievements.<br> He attacked a \"Europe ready for slavery\" writing that \"The Czechoslovak people is ready to take up a fight for liberty and transcends its own fate\" and \"It is too late for the British government to save the peace. They have lost too many opportunities\".\n\nThe Czechoslovaks were dismayed with the Munich settlement. They were not invited to the conference, and felt they had been betrayed by the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]]. [[Czechs]] and [[Slovaks]] call the Munich Agreement the '''Munich [[Diktat]]''' ({{lang-cs|Mnichovsk\u00fd dikt\u00e1t}}; {{lang-sk|Mn\u00edchovsk\u00fd dikt\u00e1t}}). The phrase \"[[Western betrayal|Munich Betrayal]]\" ({{lang-cs|Mnichovsk\u00e1 zrada}}; {{lang-sk|Mn\u00edchovsk\u00e1 zrada}}) is also used because the military alliance Czechoslovakia had with France proved useless. This was also reflected by the fact that especially the French Government had expressed the view that Czechoslovakia would be considered as being responsible for any resulting European war should the Czechoslovak Republic defend herself with arms against Germany.{{sfn|Jan Kuklik| The validity of the Munich agreement and the process of the repudiation during the second world war as seen from a Czechoslovak perspective|p=346}} <br>\n\nBritain and France signed away the territorial integrity of a sovereign state and maneuvered Prague into the position of a defeated power.<br>\nBeing presented with ultimatums from friends and enemies the Democratic Czechoslovak Government had no other alternative than to accept the dictate under protest. <br> In 1938 Soviet Union was allied with France and Czechoslovakia.

Without them its independence became more nominal than real. Czechoslovakia also lost 70% of its iron/steel industry, 70% of its electrical power and 3.5 million citizens to Germany as a result of the settlement.{{sfn|Shirer, William L.|1960}}\nThe Sudeten Germans celebrated what they saw as their liberation. The imminent war, it seemed, had been avoided.\n\nBefore the Munich Agreement, Hitler's determination to invade Czechoslovakia on 1 October 1938 had provoked a major crisis in the German command structure. The Chief of the General Staff, General [[Ludwig Beck]], protested in a lengthy series of memos that it would start a world war that Germany would lose, and urged Hitler to put off the projected war. Hitler called Beck's arguments against war \"''kindische Kr\u00e4fteberechnungen''\" (\"childish force calculations\"). On 4 August 1938, a secret Army meeting was held. Beck read his lengthy report to the assembled officers. They all agreed something had to be done to prevent certain disaster. Beck hoped they would all resign together but no one resigned except Beck. His replacement, General [[Franz Halder]], sympathised with Beck and they both conspired with several top generals, Admiral [[Wilhelm Canaris]] (Chief of German Intelligence), and [[Wolf-Heinrich Graf von Helldorf|Graf von Helldorf]] (Berlin's Police Chief) to arrest Hitler the moment he gave the invasion order. This plan would only work if Britain issued a strong warning and a letter to the effect that they would fight to preserve Czechoslovakia. This would help to convince the German people that certain defeat awaited Germany. Agents were therefore sent to England to tell Chamberlain that an attack on Czechoslovakia was planned, and of their intention to overthrow Hitler if this occurred. The proposal was rejected by the British Cabinet and no such letter was issued. Accordingly, the proposed removal of Hitler did not go ahead.{{sfn|Terry Parssinen|2004}} On this basis it has been argued that the Munich Agreement kept Hitler in power, although whether it would have been any more successful than the [[20 July plot|1944 plot]] is doubtful.\n[[File:Sudetenland Reichsgau 1944.png|thumb|Map of the Sudetenland [[Reichsgau]]]]\n\n===Opinions about the agreement===\nThe British population had expected imminent war and the \"statesman-like gesture\" of Chamberlain was at first greeted with acclaim. Chamberlain was greeted as a hero by the royal family and invited on the balcony at [[Buckingham Palace]] before he had presented the agreement to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]. The generally positive reaction quickly soured despite royal patronage. But there was opposition from the start; [[Clement Attlee]] and the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] opposed the agreement, in alliance with two Conservative MPs, [[Duff Cooper]] and [[Vyvyan Adams]], who had been seen up to then as a [[die hard (phrase)|die hard]] and reactionary element in the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].\n\nAs the threat of Germany and a European war became more evident, opinions changed. Chamberlain was excoriated for his role as one of the \"Men of Munich\", in books such as the 1940 ''[[Guilty Men]]''. A rare wartime defence of the Munich Agreement came in 1944 from [[Frederic Maugham, 1st Viscount Maugham|Viscount Maugham]], who had been Lord Chancellor at the time. Maugham viewed the decision to establish a Czechoslovak state including substantial German and Hungarian minorities as a \"dangerous experiment\" in the light of previous disputes and ascribed the Munich Agreement largely to France's need to extricate itself from its treaty obligations in the light of its unpreparedness for war.{{sfn|Viscount Maugham|1944}} After the war, Churchill's memoir of the period, ''The Gathering Storm'' (1948), asserted that Chamberlain's appeasement of Hitler at Munich had been wrong, and recorded Churchill's pre-war warnings of Hitler's plan of aggression and the folly of Britain's persisting with disarmament after Germany had achieved air parity with Britain. Although Churchill recognized that Chamberlain acted from noble motives, he argued that Hitler should have been resisted over Czechoslovakia and that efforts should have been made to involve the Soviet Union on their side.\nIn his [[The Second World War (book series)|postwar memoirs]], [[Winston Churchill]], a staunch opponent of appeasement, lumped [[Poland]] and [[Hungary]], both of which subsequently annexed parts of Czechoslovakia containing Polish and Hungarian nationals, with Germany as \"vultures upon the carcass of Czechoslovakia.\"<ref name=\"Winston S.

He told the British in a late April 1938 meeting that Hitler's real aim was to eventually secure \"a domination of the Continent in comparison with which the ambitions of Napoleon were feeble.\" He went on to say: \"Today it is the turn of Czechoslovakia. Tomorrow it will be the turn of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]]. When Germany has obtained the oil and wheat it needs, she will turn on the West. Certainly we must multiply our efforts to avoid war. But that will not be obtained unless Great Britain and France stick together, intervening in Prague for new concessions but declaring at the same time that they will safeguard the independence of Czechoslovakia. If, on the contrary, the Western Powers capitulate again they will only precipitate the war they wish to avoid.\"{{sfn|Shirer, William L.|1969|p=339\u2013340}} Perhaps discouraged by the arguments of the military and civilian members of the French government regarding their unprepared military and weak financial situation, as well as traumatised by France's bloodbath in the First World War that he was personally a witness to, Daladier ultimately let Chamberlain have his way. On his return to Paris, Daladier, who was expecting a hostile crowd, was acclaimed.\n\nAmerican historian [[William L. Shirer|William Shirer]], in his ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich]]'' (1960), took the view that although Hitler was not bluffing about his intention to invade, Czechoslovakia would have been able to offer significant resistance. Shirer believed that Britain and France had sufficient air defences to avoid serious bombing of London and Paris and would have been able to pursue a rapid and successful war against Germany.{{sfn|Shirer, William L.|1960|p=520}} He quotes Churchill as saying the Munich agreement meant that \"Britain and France were in a much worse position compared to Hitler's Germany\".{{sfn|Shirer, William L.|1960}} After Adolf Hitler personally inspected the [[Czechoslovak border fortifications|Czech fortifications]], he privately said to [[Joseph Goebbels]], \"we would have shed a lot of blood\" and that it was fortunate that there had been no fighting.<ref>Joseph Goebbels diary, 2 October 1938, p. 2.</ref>\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 137-004055, Eger, Besuch Adolf Hitlers.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Adolf Hitler]] driving through a crowd in [[Cheb]], October 1938]]\n\n===Polish and Hungarian actions during the crisis===\nPoland was building up a secret Polish organization in the area of [[Zaolzie]] from 1935.<ref name=\"Goldstein\">{{Citation\n| last       = Erik Goldstein\n| first      = Igor Lukes\n| year       = 1999\n| title      = The Munich Crisis, 1938: Prelude to World War II\n| publisher  =\n| location = New York\n| page       = 122\n| url        = https://books.google.com/?id=UzeeAO54m7gC&pg=PA60&dq=polish+demands+21+september+1938#v=onepage&q=polish%20demands%2021%20september%201938&f=false\n| accessdate = 18 September 2018\n| isbn = 9781136328398\n}}</ref> In summer 1938, Poland tried to organize guerrilla groups in the area.<ref name=\"Goldstein\" /> On 21 September, Poland officially requested a direct transfer of the area to its own control.<ref name=\"Jes\">{{Citation\n| last       = Jesensk\u00fd\n| first      = Marcel\n| title      = The Slovak\u2013Polish Border, 1918-1947\n| publisher  =\n| location =\n| page       = \n| url        = https://books.google.com/?id=KFhvBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT69&dq=polish+demands+21+september+1938#v=onepage&q=polish%20demands%2021%20september%201938&f=false\n| accessdate = 18 September 2018\n| isbn = 9781137449641\n| date = 2 September 2014\n}}</ref> This was accompanied by placing army along the Czechoslovak border on 23\u201324 September and by giving an order to the so-called \"battle units\" of Zaolzie Poles and the \"Zaolzie Legion\", a paramilitary organization subordinate to army command and made up of volunteers from all over Poland, to cross the border to Czechoslovakia and attack Czechoslovak units.<ref name=\"Goldstein\" /> Those were, however, repulsed by Czechoslovak forces and retreated to Poland.<ref name=\"Goldstein\" />\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-2004-0007, Hans Oster.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|General [[Hans Oster]], deputy head of the ''[[Abwehr]]'' met with other German military officers on 20 September 1938 to discuss final plans of a plot to overthrow the Nazi regime.]]Hungary followed Polish request for transfer of territory with its own one on 22 September.<ref name=\"Jes\" />\n\nThroughout the second half of September, Poland, had been insisting that their territorial demands on Czechoslovakia, denied to them by the Spa Conference in 1920, should be considered alongside those of Germany.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Appeasement in Crisis.

It is difficult to believe that the inquiry was made seriously. Bene\u0161 remained true to his resolve that Czechoslovakia must not fight alone nor with Soviet Russia as sole ally.

About a half million Sudeten Germans joined the Nazi Party which was 17.34% of the German population in Sudetenland (the average NSDAP participation in Nazi Germany was 7.85%). This means the Sudetenland was the most \"pro-Nazi\" region in the Third Reich.{{sfn|Zimmermann, Volker|1999|p=}}\n\nBecause of their knowledge of the Czech language, many Sudeten Germans were employed in the administration of the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] as well as in Nazi organizations ([[Gestapo]], etc.). The most notable was [[Karl Hermann Frank]]: the SS and Police general and Secretary of State in the Protectorate.\n\n====German invasion of the remainder of Czechoslovakia====\n{{main|German occupation of Czechoslovakia}}\n\nIn 1937, the [[Wehrmacht]] had formulated a plan called \"Operation Green\" ([[Fall Gr\u00fcn (Czechoslovakia)|''Fall Gr\u00fcn'']]) for the invasion of Czechoslovakia{{sfn|Herzstein, Robert Edwin|1980|p=184}} which was practically implemented after the proclamation of the [[Slovak Republic (1939-1945)|Slovak State]] on 15 March 1939.\n\nOn 14 March Slovakia seceded from Czechoslovakia and became a separate pro-Nazi state. On the following day, [[Carpatho-Ukraine]] proclaimed independence as well, but after three days was completely occupied and annexed by Hungary. Czechoslovak president [[Emil H\u00e1cha]] traveled to Berlin and was left waiting, while orders to invade were already given. During the meeting with Adolf Hitler,  H\u00e1cha was threatened with the bombing of Prague if he refused to order Czech troops to lay down their arms. This induced a heart attack, from which he was revived by an injection from Hitler's doctor. He then agreed to sign the communique accepting the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|German occupation]] of the remainder of Bohemia and Moravia \"which in its unctuous mendacity was remarkable even for the Nazis\".<ref>Noakes, J. and Pridham, G. (eds) (2010) [2001] Nazism 1919-1945, Vol 3, Foreign Policy, War and Racial Extermination, University of Exeter Press, Exeter, p.119</ref>  Churchill's prediction was fulfilled as German armies entered [[Prague]] and proceeded to occupy the rest of the country, which was transformed into a [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|protectorate of the Reich]]. In March 1939, [[Konstantin von Neurath|Neurath]] was appointed as Reichsprotektor, serving as Hitler's personal representative in the protectorate. Immediately after the occupation, a wave of arrests began, mostly of refugees from Germany, Jews and Czech public figures. By November, Jewish children had been expelled from their schools and their parents fired from their jobs.\nUniversities and colleges were closed after demonstrations against the occupation of Czechoslovakia. Over 1200 students were sent to concentration camps and nine student leaders were executed on 17th of November (The international Students' Day).\n\nBy seizing Bohemia and Moravia the [[Third Reich]] gained all the skilled labour force and heavy industry placed there as well as all the weapons of the Czechoslovak army. At the time of Hitler's later attack on France, roughly 25% of all German weapons came from the protectorate B\u00f6hmen und M\u00e4hren. The Third Reich also gained the whole Czechoslovak gold treasure, including gold stored in the [[Bank of England]]. Of a total 227 tons of gold found after the war in salt mines, only 18.4 tons were returned to Czechoslovakia in 1982, although most of this gold came from Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovakia was also forced to \"sell\" to the [[Wehrmacht]] war material for 648 million of pre-war [[Czechoslovak koruna|Czechoslovak crowns]]. This debt was never repaid.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nGermans even took the precaution of sending their troops over borders as early as the afternoon of 14 March, causing an incident between 13th (Silesian) Czechoslovak Battalion and the 8th Infantry Division of the Nazi army in M\u00edstek. After a while the Germans decided to pull out as the escalation could endanger \"peaceful\" takeover.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2004-1202-505, Prag, Burg, Besuch Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|Adolf Hitler on his visit to [[Prague Castle]] after the establishment of a German [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|protectorate]], 15 March 1939]]\nChamberlain<ref>McDonough, 2002, p.73</ref> claimed the Prague annexation was a \"completely different category\", moving [[Second Thirty Years War#The move beyond legitimate Versailles grievances, 1938-9|beyond the legitimate Versailles grievances]].\n\nMeanwhile, concerns arose in Great Britain that Poland (now substantially encircled by German possessions) would become the next target of Nazi expansionism, which was made apparent by the dispute over the [[Polish Corridor]] and the [[Free City of Danzig]]. This resulted in the signing of an [[Anglo-Polish military alliance]], and the consequent refusal of the Polish government to accept German negotiation proposals over the Polish Corridor and the status of Danzig.\n\nPrime Minister Chamberlain felt betrayed by the Nazi seizure of Czechoslovakia, realizing his policy of appeasement towards Hitler had failed, and began to take a much harder line against the Nazis. Amongst other things he immediately began to mobilize the British Empire's armed forces to a war footing. France did the same. Italy saw itself threatened by the British and French fleets and started its own [[Italian invasion of Albania|invasion of Albania]] in April 1939. Although no immediate action followed, Hitler's [[invasion of Poland]] on 1 September officially began [[World War II]].\n\nSignificant industrial potential and military equipment of the former Czechoslovakia had been efficiently absorbed into the [[Third Reich]].\n\n====Strengthening of Wehrmacht's armament====\nSince most of the border defenses were located in the territory ceded as a consequence of the Munich Agreement, the remaining part of Czechoslovakia was entirely open to further invasion, despite having relatively large stockpiles of modern weaponry. In a speech delivered in the Reichstag, Hitler expressed the importance of the occupation for strengthening of German military, noting that by occupying Czechoslovakia, Germany gained 2,175 field guns and cannons, 469 tanks, 500 anti-aircraft artillery pieces, 43,000 machine guns, 1,090,000 military rifles, 114,000 pistols, about a billion rounds of small-arms ammunition and three million rounds of anti-aircraft ammunition. This amount of weaponry would be sufficient to arm about half of the then Wehrmacht.<ref>{{Citation\n| last1  = Motl\n| first1 = Stanislav\n| lastauthoramp = yes\n| title     = Kam zmizel zlat\u00fd poklad republiky\n| publisher = Rybka publishers\n| place     = Prague\n| edition = 2nd\n| year    = 2007\n}}</ref> Czechoslovak weaponry later played major part in the German conquest of Poland and France, the latter country having urged Czechoslovakia to surrender to Germany in 1938.\n\n====Birth of German resistance within the military====\n{{main|Oster Conspiracy}}\n\nIn Germany the Sudeten crisis led to the so-called [[Oster Conspiracy]]. General [[Hans Oster]], deputy head of the ''[[Abwehr]]'', and prominent figures within the German military who opposed the regime for its behaviour that was threatening to bring Germany into a war that they believed it was not ready to fight, discussed overthrowing Hitler and the Nazi regime through a planned storming of the [[Reich Chancellery]] by forces loyal to the plot.\n\n====Italian colonial demands from France====\n{{Main|France\u2013Italy relations}}\nItaly strongly supported Germany at Munich and a few weeks later in October 1938 it tried to use its advantage to make new demands on France. Mussolini demanded: a [[List of free ports|free port]] at Djibouti, control of the Addis Ababa-Djibouti railroad, Italian participation in the management of [[Suez Canal Company]], some form of French-Italian [[Condominium (international law)|condominium]] over Tunisia, and the preservation of Italian culture in French-held Corsica with no French assimilation of the people.

On 5 August 1942, Foreign Minister Anthony Eden sent the following note to [[Jan Masaryk]]:\n\n{{bquote|In the light of recent exchanges of view between our Governments, I think it may be useful for me to make the following statement about the attitude of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom as regards Czecho-Slovakia.\n\nIn my letter of the 18th July, 1941, I informed your Excellency that the King had decided to accredit an Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Dr. Bene\u0161 as President of the Czecho-Slovak Republic. I explained that this decision implied that His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom regarded the juridical position of the President and Government of the Czecho-Slovak Republic as identical with that of the other Allied heads of States and Governments established in this country. The status of His Majesty's representative has recently been raised to that of an Ambassador.\n\nThe Prime Minister had already stated in a message broadcast to the Czecho-Slovak people on the 30th September, 1940, the attitude of His Majesty's Government in regard to the arrangements reached at Munich in 1938. Mr. Churchill then said that the Munich Agreement had been destroyed by the Germans. This statement was formally communicated to Dr. Bene\u0161 on the 11th November, 1940.\n\nThe foregoing statement and formal act of recognition have guided the policy of His Majesty's Government in regard to Czecho-Slovakia, but in order to avoid any possible misunderstanding, I desire to declare on behalf of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom that as Germany has deliberately destroyed the arrangements concerning Czecho-Slovakia reached in 1938, in which His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom participated, His Majesty's Government regard themselves as free from any engagements in this respect.

At the final settlement of the Czecho-Slovak frontiers to be reached at the end of the war, they will not be influenced by any changes effected in and since 1938.\n\nMy Government accept your Excellency's note as a practical solution of the questions and difficulties of vital importance for Czecho-Slovakia which emerged between our two countries as the consequence of the Munich Agreement, maintaining, of course, our political and juridical position with regard to the Munich Agreement and the events which followed it as expressed in the note of the Czecho-Slovak Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the 16th December, 1941. We consider your important note of the 5th August, 1942, as a highly significant act of justice towards Czecho-Slovakia, and we assure you of our real satisfaction and of our profound gratitude to your great country and nation.

She held the world in the palm of her hand. She lost both her arms in a wrestling match to win a brown-eyed handsome man.\" \n\nThe fourth track on [[Miles Davis]]' album ''[[Birth of the Cool]]'' (1957) is named \"Venus de Milo\".\n\nThe popular Lewis E.

The song is about a man that dies and is leaving parts of his body behind. He leaves her his arms in the line \u201cVenus de Milo can have my arms\u201d\n\n=== Femen protest ===\nOn 3 October 2012, French activists belonging to [[Femen]] protested against rape by standing topless in front of the Venus de Milo.

She lost both her arms in a wrestling match to win a brown eyed handsome man.\" \n\nThe fourth track on [[Miles Davis]]' album ''[[Birth of the Cool]]'' (1957) is named \"Venus de Milo\".\n\nThe popular Lewis E.

In the refrain, the narrator falls into \"the arms of Venus de Milo.\"\n\nThe song \"[[Touch Too Much]]\", on the [[AC/DC]] album ''[[Highway to Hell]]'', contains the lyrics, \"She had the face of an angel smiling with sin, The body of Venus with arms.\" \"In the arms of the angel.\"\n\nThe song \"Spaz Attack\" by the group [[2NU]] contains the lyrics, \"All of a sudden, this fully beautiful, tightly wrapped Venus de Milo look-alike comes in.\"\n\nThe Spanish song \u201cNo te cambio por nada\u201d (I wouldn\u2019t trade you for anything\u201d) by famous Guatemalan singer Ricardo Arjona, contains this phrase: \u201c...No, no, no, no te cambio por nada, \nNi por un viaje a Fiji con la Venus de Milo...\u201d (no, no, no, I will not trade you for anything, not even for a trip to Fiji with the Venus de Milo...\u201d, another of his songs \u201cNada es como t\u00fa\u201d (Nothing is like you\u201d says:  \u201cBes\u00e9 a la Venus de Milo y a una diosa en Hollywood, \nde tanto patear caminos, hoy s\u00e9 con exactitud que...
