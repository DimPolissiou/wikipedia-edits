A few days later, Volkswagen rejected the offer, and broached the subject of a potential truck alliance for the first time.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn October 2006, Volkswagen AG announced that it had acquired 15 percent of MAN SE, but did not intend to take over.

At the same time, it bought additional shares, giving it control of about 14 percent of Scania AB. After the partners also rejected the revised offer, MAN withdrew the offer in January 2007 and began talks about a possible alliance between the three companies. To further consolidate this alliance, Volkswagen acquired another 14.9 percent of MAN. Shortly afterwards, Volkswagen announced that it now held 35.3 percent of the Scania voting rights. Volkswagen acquired a further 30.62 percent of the voting rights from the Swedish [[Investor AB]] and the [[Wallenberg family|Wallenberg]] foundations in March 2008.

The company was incorporated into MAN Latin America Ltda. under a new name, selling the majority of its heavy trucks and buses under the Volkswagen Caminh\u00f5es e \u00d4nibus brand, alongside MAN Truck and Bus products. Volkswagen acquired further MAN SE shares at the beginning of May 2011 and was obliged to submit a takeover offer, which it did at the end of the same month. Volkswagen held the majority of voting rights at 55.9 percent at the end of the acceptance period. As part of further share purchases, Volkswagen announced voting rights of 75.03 percent on June 6, 2012. Due to the resulting statutory blocking minority of 25 percent, Volkswagen was given sole control of MAN SE. On April 16, 2013, Volkswagen AG applied for \u201cTruck & Bus GmbH\u201d to be entered into the commercial register of the city of Wolfsburg. On forming this new subsidiary, Volkswagen transferred the shares it held in MAN SE, with whom Truck & Bus GmbH signed a control and profit transfer agreement on June 6, 2013.

To further consolidate this alliance, Volkswagen acquired another 14.9 percent of MAN. Shortly afterwards, Volkswagen announced that it now held 35.3 percent of the Scania voting rights. Volkswagen acquired a further 30.62 percent of the voting rights from the Swedish [[Investor AB]] and the [[Wallenberg family|Wallenberg]] foundations in March 2008. Volkswagen had already controlled this share in the past by means of an agreement with the existing shareholders.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/volkswagen-takes-control-of-scania/articleshow/2835172.cms?from=mdr|title=Volkswagen takes control of Scania|date=2008-03-04|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2019-11-28}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2008, Volkswagen AG sold the Brazilian subsidiary Volkswagen Caminh\u00f5es e \u00d4nibus Ltda. to MAN SE for 1.2 billion euros. The company was incorporated into MAN Latin America Ltda. under a new name, selling the majority of its heavy trucks and buses under the Volkswagen Caminh\u00f5es e \u00d4nibus brand, alongside MAN Truck and Bus products. Volkswagen acquired further MAN SE shares at the beginning of May 2011 and was obliged to submit a takeover offer, which it did at the end of the same month. Volkswagen held the majority of voting rights at 55.9 percent at the end of the acceptance period. As part of further share purchases, Volkswagen announced voting rights of 75.03 percent on June 6, 2012. Due to the resulting statutory blocking minority of 25 percent, Volkswagen was given sole control of MAN SE. On April 16, 2013, Volkswagen AG applied for \u201cTruck & Bus GmbH\u201d to be entered into the commercial register of the city of Wolfsburg. On forming this new subsidiary, Volkswagen transferred the shares it held in MAN SE, with whom Truck & Bus GmbH signed a control and profit transfer agreement on June 6, 2013. Volkswagen AG held more than 89 percent of the Scania AB voting rights as a result of the shares in Scania held by its subsidiary, MAN.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn February 2014, Volkswagen issued a voluntary public takeover bid to the remaining shareholders of Scania. At the end of the acceptance period in June 2014, Volkswagen held 99.57 percent of the voting rights. Following the squeeze-out under Swedish law, Volkswagen AG became the holder of 83 percent of the voting rights directly and another 17 percent via MAN SE.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.autoblog.com/2015/05/05/volkswagen-truck-and-bus-official/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGqTM_9GwQv7pbABza6K1jj1xugGXrQdNAWI1iMKioYmC7R8u0FT79uNdc8zwhiYByyC0_5GimgyVOBt8uQC8IKxrxftQ4_KRxVIxPvtvqLW6P_e1mC6TkAcCSQsAejSYot3hQnsIuSw3N2qu25o-7i3xASSJV-SdCKsGjrYQK-B|title=Volkswagen Group launches Truck and Bus GmbH|last=Joseph|first=Noah|date=2015-05-05|work=Autoblog|access-date=2019-11-28}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of July 2015, the shareholders' meeting of Truck & Bus GmbH decided to rename it Volkswagen Truck & Bus GmbH, a company based in Braunschweig.
