{"title_page": "Copper Basin (Tennessee)", "text_new": "{{in use}}\n{{Other uses|Copper Basin (disambiguation){{!}}Copper Basin}}\n{{short description|Geological area in southeastern Tennessee, United States}}\nThe '''Copper Basin''', also known as the '''Ducktown Basin''', is a [[geology|geological]] region located primarily in [[Polk County, Tennessee]] that contains deposits of [[copper]] ore and covers approximately 60,000 acres. Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the nearby landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref name=ross95>Ross 1935, p. 95-96</ref><ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 13</ref>\n\nThe [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]]. The city of [[Copperhill, Tennessee|Copperhill]] is located on the southern portion of the basin near the Tennessee-Georgia border, and directly borders [[McCaysville, Georgia]]. Other communities include Postelle in the northwest section of the basin, Isabella in the eastern portion, and Harbuck, [[Turtletown, Tennessee|Turtletown]], and [[Farner, Tennessee|Farner]] just north of the basin.<ref>{{cite map |author = Tennessee Department of Transportation Long Range Planning Division Office of Data Visualization|title = Polk County|year = 2018|url =https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/tdot/maps/county-maps-(us-shields)/o-w/Polk%20County.pdf|publisher = [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]]}}</ref> The Copper Basin is also included in the [[Cleveland metropolitan area, Tennessee|Cleveland, Tennessee metropolitan area]].<ref>{{cite press release|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=OMB Designates 49 New Metropolitan Statistical Areas|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/assets/OMB/pubpress/2003-18.pdf|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[Executive branch of the United States government]]|agency=[[Office of Management and Budget]]|date=June 6, 2003|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>\n\nMost of the rocks in the Copper Basin are [[metamorphic rock]]s deposited during the [[Cambrian|Lower Cambrian period]], but also include some [[igneous rock]]s.

Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the nearby landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

Along with copper and sulfuric acid, the company built a [[froth flotation|flotation plant]] to produce [[copper sulfate]] in the 1920s.

In 1876, the companies began importing logs from Fannin County, Georgia. The smelting process released [[sulfur]] gas, which reacted with [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere, forming [[sulfuric acid]] and precipitating as [[acid rain]]. This subsequently killed the majority of the vegetation in the basin, and [[Stormwater runoff|ran off]] into the Ocoee River and surrounding tributaries, killing most aquatic life. Due to the removal of the forests, this also resulted in erosion of the topsoil, much of which ended up in the Ocoee River.<ref name=gms/> The reddish-brown landscape that resulted, which consisted mostly of iron and copper ore, was often compared to the surface of [[Mars]], and was distinctly visible from space.<ref>{{cite news|last=Benton|first=Ben|date=2020-01-01|title=Copper Basin restoration work earns engineering award|url=https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2020/jan/01/copper-basin-work-engineering-award/511930/|work=[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]|location=Chattanooga, Tennessee|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> A total of 32,000 acres were affected.<ref name=tva>{{cite web|url=https://www.tva.gov/Environment/Environmental-Stewardship/Land-Management/The-Greening-of-Copper-Basin|title=The Greening of Copper Basin|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=tva.gov|publisher=Tennessee Valley Authority|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Copper-basin-satellite-1984.png|thumb|right|Satellite showing the Copper Basin in 1984]]\nThe state of Georgia began suing the Tennessee Copper Company in the mid 1880s, claiming that the mining operations were causing damage to forests and crops in northern Georgia.

They own a house in [[Tucson, Arizona]], but since their mother left and their father is in prison, they hire Ron ([[Tyler Labine]]) to be their father. At first, the boys just need a father in specific situations, but then they find they have to keep Ron around because he is needed to shake off suspicions.<ref name=havens/>\n\n==Characters==\n===Main===\n* Ron Snuffkin ([[Tyler Labine]]) is a thirty-something sporting goods employee who is hired by the Gunderson brothers to substitute for their imprisoned father in order to shake away any suspicions from teachers and neighbors, who suspect that the boys are fending for themselves. He is a slacker who is always ready to take the easy way out of situations.\n* Gary Gunderson ([[Frank Dolce]]) (age 11) is the middle child of the Gunderson brothers and is the one who comes up with the idea to hire Ron as their fake father. Although he is very intellectual, he can get easily stressed by certain situations. His stress causes him to take blood pressure medication and his serious attitude bothers those around him.\n* Brandon Gunderson (Matthew Levy) (age 13) is the oldest of the brothers. Of the three brothers, he is most confused about life, but is always ready to speak his mind when something needs to be said. He is considered a free-spirit.\n* Robby Gunderson ([[Benjamin Stockham]]) (age 8) is the youngest and most troublesome of the brothers. He enjoys junk food and watching television for many hours.\n\n===Supporting===\n* Glenn ([[Joe Lo Truglio]]) is Ron's childhood friend. He is very impressionable and is always willing to follow Ron's schemes. He is frequently pushed around by his wife, Angela.\n* Angela ([[Sarayu Rao]]) is Glenn's wife. She is very bossy (especially towards Glenn) and does not like the fact that her husband is friends with Ron. She is very suspicious of Ron's \"fatherly care\" for his \"sons\" and frequently pesters Glenn about wanting to have children.\n* Maggie Morales ([[Natalie Martinez]]) is Robbie's third grade teacher. She is very serious about her job and sometimes worried about the environment Robbie is being raised in. It is assumed that Ron has a crush on her, after a failed attempt at getting a kiss, unbeknownst to her.\n* Mike Proudfoot ([[Michael Horse]]) is one of the employees at Ron's job, Sport Space. He is a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], who Ron always asks for advice on what a Native American would know about. Their conversations usually consist of Mike denouncing that he knows more about life than what he already knows about his heritage.\n* Joker (Edwin H. Bravo, as Edwin Habacon) is one of Ron's friends who is always ready to let him in on his illegal but profitable activities.\n\n==Guest stars==\nGuest stars during show's run included Allen Alvarado, [[Alexandra Breckenridge]], [[Jake Busey]], [[Stephanie Courtney]], [[Kurt Fuller]], [[Jamie Gray Hyder]], [[David Lambert (actor)|David Lambert]], [[Keegan-Michael Key]], [[Michael Kostroff]], [[Sydney Park (actress)|Sydney Park]], [[Stefanie Scott]], [[Hailee Steinfeld]], [[Stacey Travis]], [[Andrew Walker (actor)|Andrew Walker]], [[Nikki Ziering]], [[Buddy Handleson]] and series producer [[Justin Berfield]].\n\n==Episodes==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%; background:#fff;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#FFFFBF;\"| No.\n! style=\"background:#FFFFBF;\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#FFFFBF;\"| Directed by\n! style=\"background:#FFFFBF;\"| Written by\n! style=\"background:#FFFFBF;\"| Original air date\n! style=\"background:#FFFFBF;\"| Production<br />code<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.foxinflight.com/tv/70/ |title=Sons of Tucson |publisher=[[20th Century Fox]] |work=FoxInFlight.com |accessdate=October 21, 2010}}</ref>\n! style=\"background:#FFFFBF;\"| Viewers<br />(in millions)\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 1\n| Title = Pilot\n| DirectedBy = [[Todd Holland]]\n| WrittenBy = Greg Bratman & Tommy Dewey\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2010|3|11}} (CAN)<br />{{Start date|2010|3|14}} (US)\n| Aux4= 4.514<ref>[http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/03/15/tv-ratings-undercover-boss-beats-trumps-apprentice-sons-of-tucson-orphaned/44878 TV Ratings: ''Undercover Boss'' Beats Trump\u2019s ''Apprentice''; ''Sons Of Tucson'' Orphaned] TVbytheNumbers posted March 15, 2010 by Bill Gorman</ref>\n| ProdCode = 1ARK79\n| ShortSummary = To avoid ending up in foster care after their father is sent to prison, brothers Brandon, Gary, and Robby Gunderson set their sights on paying Ron Snuffkin, a seemingly easy mark, to pretend to be their dad.

Labine needs to know the appropriate emotional response for his character. Frank Dolce, who plays 11-year-old Gary, said Gary is in charge because his 13-year-old brother just does what makes him feel good and goes along with what others want. His 8-year-old brother couldn't be in charge because he is \"anti-authority\". Co-creator Tommy Dewey said having an 11-year-old in charge was \"more interesting\".<ref name=\"havens\">Candace Havens, \"New Fox Comedy Brings Together Old Friends,\" ''Stanly News and Press'' (FYI Television, Inc.), March 18, 2010.</ref>\n\n==Recasting==\nIn July 2009, Fox announced they were recasting the two principal roles of Robby and Brandon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20090715fox01 |title=Online Open Casting Call For FOX'S Sons of Tucson |work=The Futon Critic |date=July 15, 2009}}</ref> Producer [[Justin Berfield]] states this was due to scheduling issues.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.twitter.com/justinberfield |title=Justin Berfield's Twitter}}</ref> Robby Gunderson was originally played by [[Davis Cleveland]] and Brandon Gunderson was originally played by [[Troy Gentile]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://m.tvfanatic.com/2009/07/sons-of-tucson-recasting-key-roles/ |title=Sons of Tucson: Recasting Key Roles |publisher=TV Fanatic}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nIn its original American broadcast, the pilot episode was viewed by 4.514 million viewers and received an 18-49 [[Nielsen Rating]] of 2.1/5 coming fourth in its timeslot and becoming the least viewed show on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] that night.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/03/15/tv-ratings-undercover-boss-beats-trumps-apprentice-sons-of-tucson-orphaned/44878|title=TV Ratings Sunday: America's Funniest Home Videos Ratings, Extreme Makeover Home Edition Ratings, Desperate Housewives Ratings, Brothers & Sisters Ratings, Undercover Boss ratings,  60 Minutes ratings, Cold Case Ratings, The Simpsons Ratings, 'Til Death ratings, Family Guy ratings, Sons Of Tucson Ratings, Minute To Win It Ratings, Celebrity Apprentice ratings - Ratings - TVbytheNumbers.Zap2it.com|work=TVbytheNumbers}}</ref> Sandra Ganzalez of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the episode a positive review saying \"Like I said, there is not much by way of plot, but the individual pieces of the show give it promise.

They own a house in [[Tucson, Arizona]], but since their mother left and their father is in prison, they hire Ron ([[Tyler Labine]]) to be their father. At first, the boys just need a father in specific situations, but then they find they have to keep Ron around because he is needed to shake off suspicions.<ref name=havens/>\n\n==Characters==\n===Main===\n* Ron Snuffkin ([[Tyler Labine]]) is a thirty-something sporting goods employee who is hired by the Gunderson brothers to substitute for their imprisoned father in order to shake away any suspicions from teachers and neighbors, who suspect that the boys are fending for themselves. He is a slacker who is always ready to take the easy way out of situations.\n* Gary Gunderson ([[Frank Dolce]]) (age 11) is the middle child of the Gunderson brothers and is the one who comes up with the idea to hire Ron as their fake father. Although he is very intellectual, he can get easily stressed by certain situations. His stress causes him to take blood pressure medication and his serious attitude bothers those around him.\n* Brandon Gunderson (Matthew Levy) (age 13) is the oldest of the brothers. Of the three brothers, he is most confused about life, but is always ready to speak his mind when something needs to be said. He is considered a free-spirit.\n* Robby Gunderson ([[Benjamin Stockham]]) (age 8) is the youngest and most troublesome of the brothers. He enjoys junk food and watching television for many hours.\n\n===Supporting===\n* Glenn ([[Joe Lo Truglio]]) is Ron's childhood friend. He is very impressionable and is always willing to follow Ron's schemes. He is frequently pushed around by his wife, Angela.\n* Angela ([[Sarayu Rao]]) is Glenn's wife. She is very bossy (especially towards Glenn) and does not like the fact that her husband is friends with Ron. She is very suspicious of Ron's \"fatherly care\" for his \"sons\" and frequently pesters Glenn about wanting to have children.\n* Maggie Morales ([[Natalie Martinez]]) is Robbie's third grade teacher. She is very serious about her job and sometimes worried about the environment Robbie is being raised in. It is assumed that Ron has a crush on her, after a failed attempt at getting a kiss, unbeknownst to her.\n* Mike Proudfoot ([[Michael Horse]]) is one of the employees at Ron's job, Sport Space. He is a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], who Ron always asks for advice on what a Native American would know about. Their conversations usually consist of Mike denouncing that he knows more about life than what he already knows about his heritage.\n* Joker (Edwin H. Bravo, as Edwin Habacon) is one of Ron's friends who is always ready to let him in on his illegal but profitable activities.\n\n==Guest stars==\nGuest stars during show's run included Allen Alvarado, [[Alexandra Breckenridge]], [[Jake Busey]], [[Stephanie Courtney]], [[Kurt Fuller]], [[Jamie Gray Hyder]], [[David Lambert (actor)|David Lambert]], [[Keegan-Michael Key]], [[Michael Kostroff]], [[Sydney Park (actress)|Sydney Park]], [[Stefanie Scott]], [[Hailee Steinfeld]], [[Stacey Travis]], [[Andrew Walker (actor)|Andrew Walker]], [[Nikki Ziering]], [[Buddy Handleson]] and series producer [[Justin Berfield]].\n\n==Episodes==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%; background:#fff;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#FFFFBF;\"| No.\n! style=\"background:#FFFFBF;\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#FFFFBF;\"| Directed by\n! style=\"background:#FFFFBF;\"| Written by\n! style=\"background:#FFFFBF;\"| Original air date\n! style=\"background:#FFFFBF;\"| Production<br />code<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.foxinflight.com/tv/70/ |title=Sons of Tucson |publisher=[[20th Century Fox]] |work=FoxInFlight.com |accessdate=October 21, 2010}}</ref>\n! style=\"background:#FFFFBF;\"| Viewers<br />(in millions)\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 1\n| Title = Pilot\n| DirectedBy = [[Todd Holland]]\n| WrittenBy = Greg Bratman & Tommy Dewey\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2010|3|11}} (CAN)<br />{{Start date|2010|3|14}} (US)\n| Aux4= 4.514<ref>[http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/03/15/tv-ratings-undercover-boss-beats-trumps-apprentice-sons-of-tucson-orphaned/44878 TV Ratings: ''Undercover Boss'' Beats Trump\u2019s ''Apprentice''; ''Sons Of Tucson'' Orphaned] TVbytheNumbers posted March 15, 2010 by Bill Gorman</ref>\n| ProdCode = 1ARK79\n| ShortSummary = To avoid ending up in foster care after their father is sent to prison, brothers Brandon, Gary, and Robby Gunderson set their sights on paying Ron Snuffkin, a seemingly easy mark, to pretend to be their dad.

Labine needs to know the appropriate emotional response for his character.

During this time, his relations with the Asato family grew and he began nightly travels to the Asato family residence to receive karate instruction from Ank\u014d Asato.<ref name=\"funakoshi_autobiography\"/>\n\n==Shotokan Karate==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}\nFunakoshi had trained in both of the popular styles of Okinawan [[karate]] of the time: [[Sh\u014drei-ry\u016b]] and [[Sh\u014drin-ry\u016b]]. Shotokan is named after Funakoshi's pen name, ''Sh\u014dt\u014d'' ([[wikt:\u677e|\u677e]][[wikt:\u6fe4|\u6fe4]]), which means \"waving pines\".  ''Kan'' means training hall or house, thus ''Sh\u014dt\u014dkan'' (\u677e\u6fe4\u9928) referred to the \"house of Sh\u014dt\u014d\". This name was coined by Funakoshi's students when they posted a sign above the entrance of the hall at which Funakoshi taught. In addition to being a karate master, Funakoshi was an avid [[poet]] and [[philosopher]] who would reportedly go for long walks in the forest where he would [[meditation|meditate]] and write his poetry.<ref name=\"threemasters\">John Stevens (1995). \"Three Budo Masters: Kano, Funakoshi, Ueshiba\". Kodansha International {{ISBN|4-7700-1852-5}}</ref>\n\nBy the late 1910s, Funakoshi had many students, of which a few were deemed capable of passing on their master's teachings. Continuing his effort to garner widespread interest in Okinawan karate, Funakoshi ventured to mainland Japan in 1917, and again in 1922.<ref name=\"funakoshi_autobiography\" />\n\nIn 1930, Funakoshi established an association named Dai-Nihon Karate-do Kenkyukai to promote communication and information exchange among people who study karate-d\u014d. In 1936, Dai-Nippon Karate-do Kenkyukai changed its name to Dai-Nippon Karate-do Shoto-kai.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.shotokai.jp/english/about/history.html |title=The Official Homepage of Nihon Karate-do Shotokai |access-date=2010-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227032101/http://www.shotokai.jp/english/about/history.html |archive-date=2010-02-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The association is known today as [[Shotokai]], and is the official keeper of Funakoshi's karate heritage.\n\nIn 1936, Funakoshi built the first Sh\u014dt\u014dkan ''[[dojo]]'' (training hall) in Tokyo. While on the Japanese mainland, he changed the [[kanji|written characters]]  of karate to mean \"empty hand\" (\u7a7a\u624b) instead of \"China hand\" (\u5510\u624b) (literally [[Tang dynasty]]) to downplay its connection to [[Chinese boxing]]. Karate had borrowed many aspects from Chinese boxing.  Funakoshi also argued in his autobiography that a philosophical evaluation of the use of \"empty\" seemed to fit as it implied a way which was not tethered to any other physical object.\n\nFunakoshi's re-interpretation of the [[kanji|character]] ''kara'' in karate to mean \"empty\" ([[wikt:\u7a7a|\u7a7a]]) rather than \"Chinese\" ([[wikt:\u5510|\u5510]])  caused some tension with traditionalists back in Okinawa, prompting Funakoshi to remain in [[Tokyo]] indefinitely.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}} In 1949 Funakoshi's students created the [[Japan Karate Association]] (JKA), with Funakoshi as the honorary head of the organization. However, in practise this organization was led by [[Masatoshi Nakayama]]. The JKA began formalizing Funakoshi's teachings. Funakoshi was not supportive of all of the changes that the JKA eventually made to his karate style. He resigned from the JKA in 1956 in order to reduce friction between the JKA and Shotokai.\n\n==Illness and death==\nFunakoshi developed [[osteoarthritis]] in 1948, and died of [[colorectal cancer]] in 1957.\n\n==Legacy==\nFunakoshi published several books on karate including his autobiography, ''Karate-Do: My Way of Life''. His legacy, however, rests in a document containing his philosophies of karate training now referred to as the ''[[niju kun]]'', or \"twenty principles\".  These rules are the premise of training for all Shotokan practitioners and are published in a work titled ''The Twenty Guiding Principles of Karate''.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Twenty Guiding Principles of Karate: The Spiritual Legacy of the Master  | publisher=Kodansha International Ltd | author=Funakoshi, Gichin | translator=John Teramoto| year=1975 |isbn=4-7700-2796-6}}</ref> Within this book, Funakoshi lays out 20 rules by which students of karate are urged to abide in an effort to \"become better human beings\".<ref name=\"funakoshi_autobiography\" /> Funakoshi's Karate-Do Kyohan \"The Master Text\" remains his most detailed publication, containing sections on history, basics, [[kata]], and [[kumite]].

From about eleven years old he began to study to-te jutsu under [[Azato Anko]] and [[Itosu Anko]]. He practiced diligently and in 1912 became the president of the Okinawan Shobukai. In May 1922, he relocated to Tokyo and became a professional teacher of karate-do. He devoted his entire life to the development of karate-do. He lived out his eighty-eight years of life and left this world on April 26, 1957. Reinterpreting to-te jutsu, the Sensei promulgated karate-do while not losing its original philosophy. Like bugei (classical martial arts), so too is the pinnacle of karate \u201cmu\u201d (enlightenment): to purify and make one empty through the transformation from \u201cjutsu\u201d to \u201cdo\u201d. Through his famous words \"\u7a7a\u624b\u306b\u5148\u624b\u306a\u3057\" (karate ni sente nashi) meaning ''There is no first attack in Karate'' and \u7a7a\u624b\u306f\u541b\u5b50\u306e\u6b66\u82b8

His father's name was Gisu.<ref name=\"funakoshi_autobiography\"/> After entering primary school he became close friends with the son of [[Ank\u014d Asato]], a karate and [[Jigen-ry\u016b]] master who would soon become his first karate teacher.<ref name=\"funakoshi_autobiography\"/> \n\u2212\t\nFunakoshi's family was stiffly opposed to the Meiji government's abolition of the Japanese [[Chonmage|topknot]], and this meant that he would be ineligible to pursue his goal of attending medical school (where topknots were banned), despite having passed the entrance examination.<ref name=\"funakoshi_autobiography\"/> Being trained in both classical Chinese and Japanese philosophies and teachings, Funakoshi became an assistant teacher in Okinawa. During this time, his relations with the Asato family grew and he began nightly travels to the Asato family residence to receive karate instruction from Ank\u014d Asato.<ref name=\"funakoshi_autobiography\"/>\n\n==Shotokan Karate==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}\nFunakoshi had trained in both of the popular styles of Okinawan [[karate]] of the time: [[Sh\u014drei-ry\u016b]] and [[Sh\u014drin-ry\u016b]]. Shotokan is named after Funakoshi's pen name, ''Sh\u014dt\u014d'' ([[wikt:\u677e|\u677e]][[wikt:\u6fe4|\u6fe4]]), which means \"waving pines\".  ''Kan'' means training hall or house, thus ''Sh\u014dt\u014dkan'' (\u677e\u6fe4\u9928) referred to the \"house of Sh\u014dt\u014d\". This name was coined by Funakoshi's students when they posted a sign above the entrance of the hall at which Funakoshi taught. In addition to being a karate master, Funakoshi was an avid [[poet]] and [[philosopher]] who would reportedly go for long walks in the forest where he would [[meditation|meditate]] and write his poetry.<ref name=\"threemasters\">John Stevens (1995). \"Three Budo Masters: Kano, Funakoshi, Ueshiba\". Kodansha International {{ISBN|4-7700-1852-5}}</ref>\n\nBy the late 1910s, Funakoshi had many students, of which a few were deemed capable of passing on their master's teachings. Continuing his effort to garner widespread interest in Okinawan karate, Funakoshi ventured to mainland Japan in 1917, and again in 1922.<ref name=\"funakoshi_autobiography\" />\n\nIn 1930, Funakoshi established an association named Dai-Nihon Karate-do Kenkyukai to promote communication and information exchange among people who study karate-d\u014d. In 1936, Dai-Nippon Karate-do Kenkyukai changed its name to Dai-Nippon Karate-do Shoto-kai.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.shotokai.jp/english/about/history.html |title=The Official Homepage of Nihon Karate-do Shotokai |access-date=2010-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227032101/http://www.shotokai.jp/english/about/history.html |archive-date=2010-02-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The association is known today as [[Shotokai]], and is the official keeper of Funakoshi's karate heritage.\n\nIn 1936, Funakoshi built the first Sh\u014dt\u014dkan ''[[dojo]]'' (training hall) in Tokyo. While on the Japanese mainland, he changed the [[kanji|written characters]]  of karate to mean \"empty hand\" (\u7a7a\u624b) instead of \"China hand\" (\u5510\u624b) (literally [[Tang dynasty]]) to downplay its connection to [[Chinese boxing]]. Karate had borrowed many aspects from Chinese boxing.  Funakoshi also argued in his autobiography that a philosophical evaluation of the use of \"empty\" seemed to fit as it implied a way which was not tethered to any other physical object.\n\nFunakoshi's re-interpretation of the [[kanji|character]] ''kara'' in karate to mean \"empty\" ([[wikt:\u7a7a|\u7a7a]]) rather than \"Chinese\" ([[wikt:\u5510|\u5510]])  caused some tension with traditionalists back in Okinawa, prompting Funakoshi to remain in [[Tokyo]] indefinitely.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}} In 1949 Funakoshi's students created the [[Japan Karate Association]] (JKA), with Funakoshi as the honorary head of the organization. However, in practise this organization was led by [[Masatoshi Nakayama]]. The JKA began formalizing Funakoshi's teachings. Funakoshi was not supportive of all of the changes that the JKA eventually made to his karate style. He resigned from the JKA in 1956 in order to reduce friction between the JKA and Shotokai.\n\n==Illness and death==\nFunakoshi developed [[osteoarthritis]] in 1948, and died of [[colorectal cancer]] in 1957.\n\n==Legacy==\nFunakoshi published several books on karate including his autobiography, ''Karate-Do: My Way of Life''. His legacy, however, rests in a document containing his philosophies of karate training now referred to as the ''[[niju kun]]'', or \"twenty principles\".  These rules are the premise of training for all Shotokan practitioners and are published in a work titled ''The Twenty Guiding Principles of Karate''.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Twenty Guiding Principles of Karate: The Spiritual Legacy of the Master  | publisher=Kodansha International Ltd | author=Funakoshi, Gichin | translator=John Teramoto| year=1975 |isbn=4-7700-2796-6}}</ref> Within this book, Funakoshi lays out 20 rules by which students of karate are urged to abide in an effort to \"become better human beings\".<ref name=\"funakoshi_autobiography\" /> Funakoshi's Karate-Do Kyohan \"The Master Text\" remains his most detailed publication, containing sections on history, basics, [[kata]], and [[kumite]].

Once logged, the Beach Coordinator will check in on these dogs, and give them food and medicine, each day, until space opens up in the Sato Project shelter. Once a dog is taken to the shelter it receives a full [[check-up]]: A [[veterinarian]] determines what, if any, medications or care is required for that animal to return to full health. In addition to a check-up, the dogs are spayed/neutered and [[vaccinate]]d. When the dog is finally well enough to travel, volunteers in Puerto Rico help prepare it to fly to either [[JFK Airport|JFK]] in New York or [[Newark Airport]] in New Jersey. Upon arriving, the dogs are received by another team of volunteers who transport them to the project's adoption team.

Further reports followed in the Swiss publication ''Das Magazin'' by Hannes Grasseger and Mikael Krogerus (December 2016), (later translated and published by ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]''), [[Carole Cadwalladr]] in ''The Guardian'' (starting in February 2017) and Mattathias Schwartz in ''[[The Intercept]]'' (March 2017). Facebook refused to comment on the claims in any of the articles.\n\nThe scandal finally erupted in March 2018 with the emergence of a whistle-blower, an ex-Cambridge Analytica employee [[Christopher Wylie]]. He had been an anonymous source for an article in 2017 in [[The Observer]] by Cadwalladr, headlined \"The Great British [[Brexit]] Robbery\".<ref name=\":04\" /> This article went viral but was disbelieved in some quarters, prompting skeptical responses in [[The New York Times]] among others. Cadwalladr worked with Wylie for a year to coax him to come forward as a whistleblower. She later brought in [[Channel 4 News]] in the UK and The New York Times due to legal threats against The Guardian and The Observer by Cambridge Analytica.\n\nThe three news organisations published simultaneously on March 17, 2018, and caused a huge public outcry. More than $100 billion was knocked off Facebook's market capitalization in days and politicians in the US and UK demanded answers from Facebook CEO [[Mark Zuckerberg]]. The scandal eventually led to him agreeing to testify in front of the [[United States Congress]].\n\n==Characteristics of the data==\n\n==== Numbers ====\n''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', ''The New

Further reports followed in the Swiss publication ''Das Magazin'' by Hannes Grasseger and Mikael Krogerus (December 2016), (later translated and published by ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]''), [[Carole Cadwalladr]] in ''The Guardian'' (starting in February 2017) and Mattathias Schwartz in ''[[The Intercept]]'' (March 2017). Facebook refused to comment on the claims in any of the articles.\n\nThe scandal finally erupted in March 2018 with the emergence of a whistle-blower, an ex-Cambridge Analytica employee [[Christopher Wylie]]. He had been an anonymous source for an article in 2017 in [[The Observer]] by Cadwalladr, headlined \"The Great British [[Brexit]] Robbery\".<ref name=\":04\" /> This article went viral but was disbelieved in some quarters, prompting skeptical responses in [[The New York Times]] among others. Cadwalladr worked with Wylie for a year to coax him to come forward as a whistleblower. She later brought in [[Channel 4 News]] in the UK and The New York Times due to legal threats against The Guardian and The Observer by Cambridge Analytica.\n\nThe three news organisations published simultaneously on March 17, 2018, and caused a huge public outcry. More than $100 billion was knocked off Facebook's market capitalization in days and politicians in the US and UK demanded answers from Facebook CEO [[Mark Zuckerberg]]. The scandal eventually led to him agreeing to testify in front of the [[United States Congress]].\n\n==Characteristics of the data==\n\n==== Numbers ====\n''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', ''The New York Times'', and ''The Observer'' reported that the data-set had included information on 50 million Facebook users.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-exposed-87-million-users-to-cambridge-analytica/|title=Facebook Exposed 87 Million Users to Cambridge Analytica|work=Wired|access-date=2020-03-23|language=en|issn=1059-1028}}</ref><ref name=\"NYT original4\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html|title=How Trump Consultants Exploited the Facebook Data of Millions|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Matthew|last2=Confessore|first2=Nicholas|date=March 17, 2018|website=The New York Times|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317131953/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html|archive-date=March 17, 2018|last3=Cadwalladr|first3=Carole|df=}}</ref> While Cambridge Analytica claimed it had only collected 30 million Facebook user profiles,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/facebook-send-cambridge-analytica-data-use-notices-monday-n863811|title=Facebook to send Cambridge Analytica data-use notices to 87 million users today|date=April 9, 2018|work=NBC News|accessdate=April 9, 2018|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> Facebook later confirmed that it actually had data on potentially over 87 million users,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1245049/the-cambridge-analytica-scandal-affected-87-million-people-facebook-says/|title=The Cambridge Analytica scandal affected 87 million people, Facebook says|last1=Kozlowska|first1=Hanna|date=April 4, 2018|website=Quartz|accessdate=April 5, 2018}}</ref> with 70.6 million of those people from the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1245355/outside-us-philippines-saw-most-facebook-user-data-go-to-cambridge-analytica/|title=Outside US, Philippines saw most Facebook user data go to Cambridge Analytica|last1=Horwitz|first1=Josh|date=April 5, 2018|website=Quartz|accessdate=April 5, 2018}}</ref> Within the United States, Facebook estimated that [[California]] was the most affected U.S. state, with 6.7 million impacted users, followed by [[Texas]], with 5.6 million, and [[Florida]], with 4.3 million.<ref>{{cite news|last=Nieva|first=Richard|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/most-facebook-users-hit-by-cambridge-analytica-scandal-are-californians/|title=Most Facebook users hit by Cambridge Analytica scandal are Californians|date=June 13, 2018|accessdate=June 13, 2018|publisher=CNET}}</ref> Data was collected on 87 million users while only 270,000 people downloaded the app.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n==== Information ====\nFacebook sent a message to those users believed to be affected, saying the information likely included one's \"public profile, page likes, birthday and current city\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Coulter|first=Martin|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/tech/how-to-find-out-if-your-facebook-data-was-shared-with-cambridge-analytica-using-new-tool-launched-by-a3810551.html|title=Find out if your Facebook data was shared with Cambridge Analytica|work=Evening Standard|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}</ref> Some of the app's users gave the app permission to access their News Feed, timeline, and messages.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/story/cambridge-analytica-private-facebook-messages/|title=Cambridge Analytica Could Also Access Private Facebook Messages|work=Wired|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}</ref> The data was detailed enough for Cambridge Analytica to create [[Psychographics|psychographic]] profiles of the subjects of the data.<ref name=\"NYT original4\" /> The data also included the locations of each person.<ref name=\"NYT original4\" /> For a given political campaign, the data was detailed enough to create a profile which suggested what kind of advertisement would be most effective to persuade a particular person in a particular location for some political event.<ref name=\"NYT original4\" />\n\n==Use of the data==\nPolitical events for which politicians paid Cambridge Analytica to use information from the data breach include the following:\n\n==== '''Ted Cruz Campaign''' ====\nIn 2016, Ted Cruz hired Cambridge Analytica to aid his presidential Campaign.
