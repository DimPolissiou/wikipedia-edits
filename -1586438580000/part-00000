In his first book ''Imaginary Communities'', Wegner argues that the history of the utopian genre is \"inseparable from a history of [[modernity]] in which the works comprising this important genre play such a significant role.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Imaginary Communities|last=Wegner|first=Phillip|publisher=University of California Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=Berkley|pages=xvi|via=}}</ref> In ''Shockwaves of Possibility,'' Wegner makes a similar argument about utopia and the genre of science fiction, arguing that \"Utopianism is not simply one among a range of possible themes or motifs in modern science fiction... Rather, Utopianism is fundamental to the very narrative dynamic of this vital modern practice.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Shockwaves of Possibility: Essays on Science Fiction, Globalization, and Utopia|last=Wegner|first=Phillip|publisher=Peter Lang|year=2014|isbn=|location=New York|pages=xiii|via=}}</ref> In addition to his academic research on Utopia, Wegner served as President of the [[Society for Utopian Studies]] from 2010-2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://utopian-studies.org/committees/|title=Committees|date=2011-10-16|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-12}}</ref>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n=== Books ===\n\n* ''Periodizing Jameson: Dialectics, the University, and the Desire for Narrative.''
