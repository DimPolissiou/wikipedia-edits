The empire formally existed from 1674 with the coronation of [[Shivaji]] as the [[Chhatrapati]] and ended in 1818 with the defeat of ''[[Peshwa]]'' [[Bajirao II]] by the hands of the [[British East India Company]]. The Marathas are credited to a large extent for ending [[Mughal Empire|Mughal rule]] in India.{{sfnp|Pearson|1976|pp=221-235}}{{sfnp|Capper|1997|p=|ps=:This source establishes the Maratha control of Delhi before the British}}{{sfnp|Sen|2010|pp=1941-|ps=:The victory at Bhopal in 1738 established Maratha dominance at the Mughal court}}{{#tag:ref| Some historians{{sfnp|Schmidt|2015|ppp=54-}} may consider 1645 as the founding of the empire because that was the year when the teenaged Shivaji captured a fort from Adilshahi sultanate.|group=note}}\n\nThe Marathas were a [[Marathi language|Marathi]]-speaking warrior group from the western [[Deccan Plateau]] (present-day [[Maharashtra]]) who rose to prominence by establishing a [[Hindavi Swarajya]] (meaning \"self-rule of Hindu/Indian people\").{{sfnp|Pagdi| 1993|p=98|ps=: Shivaji's coronation and setting himself up as a sovereign prince symbolises the rise of the Indian people in all parts of the country. It was a bid for ''Hindawi Swarajya'' (Indian rule), a term in use in Marathi sources of history.}}{{sfnp|Jackson|2005|p=38}} The Marathas became prominent in the 17th century under the leadership of [[Shivaji Maharaj]], who revolted against the [[Adil Shahi dynasty]], and carved out a kingdom with [[Raigad Fort|Raigad]] as his capital. His father, [[Shahji]] had earlier conquered [[Thanjavur]] which Shivaji's step-brother, Venkoji Rao alias [[Ekoji]] inherited and that Kingdom was known as the [[Thanjavur Maratha kingdom]]. The descendants of Venkoji Rao speak [[Thanjavur Marathi dialect|Thanjavur Marathi]]. Known for their mobility, the Marathas were able to consolidate their territory during the [[Mughal\u2013Maratha Wars]] and later controlled a large part of the Indian subcontinent.\n\nAfter the death of [[Aurangzeb]] in 1707, [[Shahu I|Shahu]], grandson of Shivaji, was released by the Mughals.{{sfnp|Manohar |1959|p=63}} Following a brief struggle with his aunt [[Tarabai]], Shahu became the ruler and appointed [[Balaji Vishwanath]] and later, his descendants, as the ''[[peshwa]]s'' or prime ministers of the empire.{{sfnp|Ahmad|Krishnamurti|1962}} Balaji and his descendants played a key role in the expansion of Maratha rule. The empire at its peak stretched from [[Tamil Nadu]]{{sfnp|Mehta|2005|p=204|ps=}} in the south, to [[Maratha conquest of North-west India|Peshawar]] (modern-day [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], [[Pakistan]]{{sfnp|Sen|2010|p=16}}{{#tag:ref|Many historians consider [[Attock]] to be the final frontier of the Maratha Empire{{sfnp|Majumdar|1951b|p=}}|group=note}}) in the north, and [[Maratha expeditions in Bengal|Bengal Subah]] in the east. The Marathas discussed abolishing the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal throne]] and placing [[Vishwasrao|Vishwasrao Peshwa]] on the Mughal imperial throne in [[Delhi]] but were not able to do so.{{sfnp|Ghazi|2002|p=130}}  In 1761, the [[Maratha Army]] lost the [[Third Battle of Panipat]] against  [[Ahmad Shah Abdali]] of the Afghan [[Durrani Empire]], which halted their imperial expansion into [[Afghanistan]]. Ten years after Panipat, the young Peshwa [[Madhavrao I]]'s [[Maratha Resurrection]] reinstated Maratha authority over [[North India]].\n\nIn a bid to effectively manage the large empire, Madhavrao gave semi-autonomy to the strongest of the knights, and created a confederacy of Maratha states. These leaders became known as the [[Gaekwad]]s of [[Baroda State|Baroda]], the [[Holkar]]s of [[Indore State|Indore]] and [[Malwa]], the [[Scindia]]s of [[Gwalior State|Gwalior]] and [[Ujjain]], the [[Bhonsale]]s of [[Nagpur kingdom|Nagpur]], the Meheres of [[Vidharbha]] and the [[Paramara dynasty|Puars]] of [[Dhar State|Dhar]] and [[Dewas State|Dewas]]. In 1775, the [[East India Company]] intervened in a Peshwa family succession struggle in [[Pune]], which led to the [[First Anglo-Maratha War]]. The Marathas were victorious.{{sfnp|Naravane|2014|p=63}} The Maratha remained the pre-eminent power in India until their defeat in the [[Second Anglo-Maratha War|Second]] and [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]]s (1805\u20131818), which resulted in the East India Company seizing control of most of India.\n\nA large portion of the Maratha empire was coastline, which had been secured by the potent [[Maratha Navy]] under commanders such as [[Kanhoji Angre]].

Nana's administrative, diplomatic and financial skills brought prosperity to the Maratha Empire and his management of external affairs kept the Maratha Empire away from the thrust of the British East India Company.\n\n== Rulers, administrators and generals ==\n\n=== Royal houses ===\n\n* [[Shivaji]] (1630\u20131680)\n* [[Sambhaji]] (1657\u20131689)\n* [[Rajaram Chhatrapati]] (1670\u20131700)\n\n'''Satara''':\n\n* [[Shahu I]] ({{reign|1708|1749}}) (alias Shivaji II, son of Sambhaji)\n* [[Ramaraja]] II (nominally, grandson of Rajaram and Queen Tarabai) ({{reign|1749|1777}})\n* [[Shahu II of Satara|Shahu II]] ({{reign|1777|1808}})\n* [[Pratap Singh, Raja of Satara|Pratap Singh]] ({{reign|1808|1839}}) \u2013 signed a treaty with the East India company ceding part of sovereignty to the company{{sfnp|Kulkarni|1995|p=21}}\n\n'''Kolhapur''':\n\n* [[Tarabai]] (1675\u20131761) (wife of Rajaram) in the name of her son Shivaji II\n* [[Shivaji II]] (1700\u20131714)\n* [[Sambhaji II]] (1714 to 1760) \u2013 came to power by deposing his half brother Shivaji II\n* [[Shivaji III]] (1760\u20131812) (adopted from the family of Khanwilkar)\n\n=== Peshwas ===\n\n* [[Moropant Trimbak Pingle]] (1657\u20131683)\n* [[Moreshvar Pingale|Nilakanth Moreshvar Pingale]] (1683-1689)\n* [[Ramchandra Pant Amatya]] (1689-1708)\n* [[Bahiroji Pingale]] (1708\u20131711)\n* [[Parshuram Pant Pratinidhi|Parshuram Trimbak Kulkarni]] (1711-1713)\n\n==== Peshwas from Bhat family ====\n\nFrom Balaji Vishwanath onwards, actual power gradually shifted to the Bhat family Peshwas based in [[Poona]].\n\n* [[Balaji Vishwanath]] (1713\u20131720)\n* [[Bajirao]] (1720\u20131740)\n* [[Nanasaheb Peshwa|Balaji Bajirao]] (4 Jul 1740 \u2013 23 Jun 1761) (b. 8 Dec 1721, d. 23 Jun 1761)\n* [[Madhavrao Peshwa]] (1761 \u2013 18 Nov 1772) (b. 16 Feb 1745, d. 18 Nov 1772)\n* [[Narayanrao Bajirao]] (13 Dec 1772 \u2013 30 Aug 1773) (b. 10 Aug 1755, d. 30 Aug 1773)\n* [[Raghunathrao]] (5 Dec 1773 \u2013 1774) (b. 18 Aug 1734, d. 11 Dec 1783)\n* [[Sawai Madhava Rao II Narayan]] (1774 \u2013 27 Oct 1795) (b. 18 Apr 1774, d. 27 Oct 1795)\n* [[Baji Rao II]] (6 Dec 1796 \u2013 3 Jun 1818) (d. 28 Jan 1851)\n\n== Houses of Maratha Confederacy ==\n\n* [[Holkar]]s of [[Indore]]\n* [[Scindia]]s of [[Gwalior]]\n* [[Gaikwad]]s of [[Baroda]]\n* [[Bhonsale]]s of [[Nagpur]]\n* [[Puars]] of [[Dewas]] and [[Dhar]]\n* [[Patwardhans]]\n*[[Bhoite Saranjam|Bhoite's]] of Jalgaon, [[Bhoite|Aradgaon]]\n\n== Maps showing the Maratha Empire at different stages of history ==\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Shivaji's kingdom 1680.jpg|Maratha kingdom in 1680 ''(green)''\nFile:India1760 1905.jpg|Maratha Empire in 1760 ''(yellow)''\nFile:IGI1908India1765a.jpg|Maratha Empire in 1765 ''(yellow)''\nFile:Joppen1907India1795a.jpg|Maratha Empire in 1794 ''(yellow)''\nFile:Joppen1907India1805a.jpg|Maratha Empire in 1805 \n</gallery>\n\n== Thanjavur Maratha Kingdom (Tamil Nadu) ==\n{{Main|Thanjavur Marathas}}\n[[File:Thanjavur Maratha Palace Darbar Hall.jpg|thumb|[[Thanjavur Maratha palace]]]]\n\nThe Thanjavur Marathas were the rulers of [[Thanjavur]] principality of Tamil Nadu between the 17th and 19th centuries.

The empire formally existed from 1674 with the coronation of [[Shivaji]] as the [[Chhatrapati]] and ended in 1818 with the defeat of ''[[Peshwa]]'' [[Bajirao II]] by the hands of the [[British East India Company]]. The Marathas are credited to a large extent for ending [[Mughal Empire|Mughal rule]] in India.{{sfnp|Pearson|1976|pp=221-235}}{{sfnp|Capper|1997|p=|ps=:This source establishes the Maratha control of Delhi before the British}}{{sfnp|Sen|2010|pp=1941-|ps=:The victory at Bhopal in 1738 established Maratha dominance at the Mughal court}}{{#tag:ref| Some historians{{sfnp|Schmidt|2015|ppp=54-}} may consider 1645 as the founding of the empire because that was the year when the teenaged Shivaji captured a fort from Adilshahi sultanate.|group=note}}\n\nThe Marathas were a [[Marathi language|Marathi]]-speaking warrior group from the western [[Deccan Plateau]] (present-day [[Maharashtra]]) who rose to prominence by establishing a [[Hindavi Swarajya]] (meaning \"self-rule of Hindu/Indian people\").{{sfnp|Pagdi| 1993|p=98|ps=: Shivaji's coronation and setting himself up as a sovereign prince symbolises the rise of the Indian people in all parts of the country. It was a bid for ''Hindawi Swarajya'' (Indian rule), a term in use in Marathi sources of history.}}{{sfnp|Jackson|2005|p=38}} The Marathas became prominent in the 17th century under the leadership of [[Shivaji Maharaj]], who revolted against the [[Adil Shahi dynasty]], and carved out a kingdom with [[Raigad Fort|Raigad]] as his capital. His father, [[Shahji]] had earlier conquered [[Thanjavur]] which Shivaji's step-brother, Venkoji Rao alias [[Ekoji]] inherited and that Kingdom was known as the [[Thanjavur Maratha kingdom]]. The descendants of Venkoji Rao speak [[Thanjavur Marathi dialect|Thanjavur Marathi]]. Known for their mobility, the Marathas were able to consolidate their territory during the [[Mughal\u2013Maratha Wars]] and later controlled a large part of the Indian subcontinent.\n\nAfter the death of [[Aurangzeb]] in 1707, [[Shahu I|Shahu]], grandson of Shivaji, was released by the Mughals.{{sfnp|Manohar |1959|p=63}} Following a brief struggle with his aunt [[Tarabai]], Shahu became the ruler and appointed [[Balaji Vishwanath]] and later, his descendants, as the ''[[peshwa]]s'' or prime ministers of the empire.{{sfnp|Ahmad|Krishnamurti|1962}} Balaji and his descendants played a key role in the expansion of Maratha rule. The empire at its peak stretched from [[Tamil Nadu]]{{sfnp|Mehta|2005|p=204|ps=}} in the south, to [[Maratha conquest of North-west India|Peshawar]] (modern-day [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], [[Pakistan]]{{sfnp|Sen|2010|p=16}}{{#tag:ref|Many historians consider [[Attock]] to be the final frontier of the Maratha Empire{{sfnp|Majumdar|1951b|p=}}|group=note}}) in the north, and [[Maratha expeditions in Bengal|Bengal Subah]] in the east. The Marathas discussed abolishing the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal throne]] and placing [[Vishwasrao|Vishwasrao Peshwa]] on the Mughal imperial throne in [[Delhi]] but were not able to do so.{{sfnp|Ghazi|2002|p=130}}  In 1761, the [[Maratha Army]] lost the [[Third Battle of Panipat]] against  [[Ahmad Shah Abdali]] of the Afghan [[Durrani Empire]], which halted their imperial expansion into [[Afghanistan]]. Ten years after Panipat, the young Peshwa [[Madhavrao I]]'s [[Maratha Resurrection]] reinstated Maratha authority over [[North India]].\n\nIn a bid to effectively manage the large empire, Madhavrao gave semi-autonomy to the strongest of the knights, and created a confederacy of Maratha states. These leaders became known as the [[Gaekwad]]s of [[Baroda State|Baroda]], the [[Holkar]]s of [[Indore State|Indore]] and [[Malwa]], the [[Scindia]]s of [[Gwalior State|Gwalior]] and [[Ujjain]], the [[Bhonsale]]s of [[Nagpur kingdom|Nagpur]], the Meheres of [[Vidharbha]] and the [[Paramara dynasty|Puars]] of [[Dhar State|Dhar]] and [[Dewas State|Dewas]]. In 1775, the [[East India Company]] intervened in a Peshwa family succession struggle in [[Pune]], which led to the [[First Anglo-Maratha War]]. The Marathas were victorious.{{sfnp|Naravane|2014|p=63}} The Maratha remained the pre-eminent power in India until their defeat in the [[Second Anglo-Maratha War|Second]] and [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]]s (1805\u20131818), which resulted in the East India Company seizing control of most of India.\n\nA large portion of the Maratha empire was coastline, which had been secured by the potent [[Maratha Navy]] under commanders such as [[Kanhoji Angre]]. He was very successful at keeping foreign naval ships at bay, particularly those of the Portuguese and British.{{sfnp|Pagdi|1993|p=21}} Securing the coastal areas and building land-based fortifications were crucial aspects of the Maratha's defensive strategy and regional [[Military history of India|military history]].\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n\nThe Maratha Empire is also referred to as the Maratha Confederacy. The historian [[Barbara Ramusack]] says that the former is a designation preferred by Indian nationalists, while the latter was that used by British historians. She notes, \"neither term is fully accurate since one implies a substantial degree of centralisation and the other signifies some surrender of power to a central government and a longstanding core of political administrators\".{{sfnp|Ramusack|2004|p=35}}\n\nAlthough at present, the word [[Maratha]] refers to a particular caste of warriors and peasants, in the past the word has been used to describe all [[Marathi people]].{{sfnp|Jones|1974|p=25}}{{sfnp|Gokhale |1988 |p=112}}\n\n== History ==\n\nThe empire had its head in the [[Chhatrapati]] as ''de jure'', but the ''de facto'' governance was in the hands of the [[Peshwa]]s.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} After the death of Chhatrapati [[Shahu I]] and with the death of Peshwa [[Madhavrao I]], various chiefs played the role of the ''de facto'' rulers in their own regions.\n\n== Shivaji and his descendants ==\n\n=== Shivaji===\n{{Main|Shivaji }}\n[[File:Shivaji British Museum.jpg|thumb|left|A portrait of Shivaji Maharaj]]\n\n[[Shivaji]] (1627\u20131680) was a Maratha aristocrat of the [[Bhosle|Bhosale]] clan who is the founder of the Maratha empire.{{sfnp|Pearson|1976|pp=221-235}} Shivaji led a resistance to free the people from the Sultanate of [[Adil Shahi dynasty|Bijapur]] in 1645 by winning the fort Torna, followed by many more forts, placing the area under his control and establishing [[Hindavi Swarajya]] (self-rule of Hindu people{{sfnp|Jackson|2005|p=38}}). He created an independent Maratha kingdom with [[Raigad fort|Raigad]] as its capital{{sfnp|Vartak|1999|pp=1126\u20131134}} and successfully fought against the Mughals to defend his kingdom.

With his entire imperial court, administration and an army of about 500,000 troops, he proceeded to expand the Mughal empire, gaining territories such as the sultanates of Bijapur and [[Golconda]].

The real contest for India was never a single decisive battle for the subcontinent. Rather it turned on a complex social and political struggle for control of the South Asian military economy.

Nana's administrative, diplomatic and financial skills brought prosperity to the Maratha Empire and his management of external affairs kept the Maratha Empire away from the thrust of the British East India Company.\n\n== Rulers, administrators and generals ==\n\n=== Royal houses ===\n\n* [[Shivaji]] (1630\u20131680)\n* [[Sambhaji]] (1657\u20131689)\n* [[Rajaram Chhatrapati]] (1670\u20131700)\n\n'''Satara''':\n\n* [[Shahu I]] ({{reign|1708|1749}}) (alias Shivaji II, son of Sambhaji)\n* [[Ramaraja]] II (nominally, grandson of Rajaram and Queen Tarabai) ({{reign|1749|1777}})\n* [[Shahu II of Satara|Shahu II]] ({{reign|1777|1808}})\n* [[Pratap Singh, Raja of Satara|Pratap Singh]] ({{reign|1808|1839}}) \u2013 signed a treaty with the East India company ceding part of sovereignty to the company{{sfnp|Kulkarni|1995|p=21}}\n\n'''Kolhapur''':\n\n* [[Tarabai]] (1675\u20131761) (wife of Rajaram) in the name of her son Shivaji II\n* [[Shivaji II]] (1700\u20131714)\n* [[Sambhaji II]] (1714 to 1760) \u2013 came to power by deposing his half brother Shivaji II\n* [[Shivaji III]] (1760\u20131812) (adopted from the family of Khanwilkar)\n\n=== Peshwas ===\n\n* [[Moropant Trimbak Pingle]] (1657\u20131683)\n* [[Moreshvar Pingale|Nilakanth Moreshvar Pingale]] (1683-1689)\n* [[Ramchandra Pant Amatya]] (1689-1708)\n* [[Bahiroji Pingale]] (1708\u20131711)\n* [[Parshuram Pant Pratinidhi|Parshuram Trimbak Kulkarni]] (1711-1713)\n\n==== Peshwas from Bhat family ====\n\nFrom Balaji Vishwanath onwards, actual power gradually shifted to the Bhat family Peshwas based in [[Poona]].\n\n* [[Balaji Vishwanath]] (1713\u20131720)\n* [[Bajirao]] (1720\u20131740)\n* [[Nanasaheb Peshwa|Balaji Bajirao]] (4 Jul 1740 \u2013 23 Jun 1761) (b. 8 Dec 1721, d. 23 Jun 1761)\n* [[Madhavrao Peshwa]] (1761 \u2013 18 Nov 1772) (b. 16 Feb 1745, d. 18 Nov 1772)\n* [[Narayanrao Bajirao]] (13 Dec 1772 \u2013 30 Aug 1773) (b. 10 Aug 1755, d. 30 Aug 1773)\n* [[Raghunathrao]] (5 Dec 1773 \u2013 1774) (b. 18 Aug 1734, d. 11 Dec 1783)\n* [[Sawai Madhava Rao II Narayan]] (1774 \u2013 27 Oct 1795) (b. 18 Apr 1774, d. 27 Oct 1795)\n* [[Baji Rao II]] (6 Dec 1796 \u2013 3 Jun 1818) (d. 28 Jan 1851)\n\n== Houses of Maratha Confederacy ==\n\n* [[Holkar]]s of [[Indore]]\n* [[Scindia]]s of [[Gwalior]]\n* [[Gaikwad]]s of [[Baroda]]\n* [[Bhonsale]]s of [[Nagpur]]\n* [[Puars]] of [[Dewas]] and [[Dhar]]\n* [[Patwardhans]]\n*[[Bhoite Saranjam|Bhoite's]] of Jalgaon, [[Bhoite|Aradgaon]]\n\n== Maps showing the Maratha Empire at different stages of history ==\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Shivaji's kingdom 1680.jpg|Maratha kingdom in 1680 ''(green)''\nFile:India1760 1905.jpg|Maratha Empire in 1760 ''(yellow)''\nFile:IGI1908India1765a.jpg|Maratha Empire in 1765 ''(yellow)''\nFile:Joppen1907India1795a.jpg|Maratha Empire in 1794 ''(yellow)''\nFile:Joppen1907India1805a.jpg|Maratha Empire in 1805 \n</gallery>\n\n== Thanjavur Maratha Kingdom (Tamil Nadu) ==\n{{Main|Thanjavur Marathas}}\n[[File:Thanjavur Maratha Palace Darbar Hall.jpg|thumb|[[Thanjavur Maratha palace]]]]\n\nThe Thanjavur Marathas were the rulers of [[Thanjavur]] principality of Tamil Nadu between the 17th and 19th centuries.

EDITS BETWEEN THE TAGS APPEAR IN THAT ARTICLE. (Please verify that these tags are not removed or displaced when using the visual editor) -->\n<!-- 1. Accidents -->\n<section begin=\"summary\" />In March 2019, [[National aviation authority|aviation authorities]] worldwide [[Aircraft on ground|grounded]] the [[Boeing 737 MAX]] passenger [[airliner]] after 346 people died in two plane crashes, [[Lion Air Flight 610]] on October 29, 2018 and [[Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302]] on March 10, 2019. <!-- 2. MCAS --> In November 2018,  Boeing and the [[U.S. Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) emphasized to airlines that pilots could use an existing [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System#Runaway stabilizer and manual trim|recovery procedure]] if the airplane experienced an unintended [[Descent (aeronautics)#Dives|nosedive]]. Investigators suspected the cause was a new automated flight control feature on the MAX, the [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System]] (MCAS), which Boeing had not described in crew manuals or training. In December 2018, the FAA predicted more accidents if MCAS was not revised, but kept its findings private and believed the advisories to airlines were sufficient until Boeing developed a permanent solution.\n\n<!-- 3. Groundings -->\nOn March 10, day of the second crash, Ethiopian Airlines grounded its remaining MAX fleet. On March 11, the [[Civil Aviation Administration of China]] ordered the first nationwide grounding, followed by most other regulators in quick succession. The FAA publicly asserted the MAX's [[Continued Airworthiness Notification to the International Community|continued airworthiness]]on March 11, then grounded the airplane on March 13  after receiving evidence of accident similarities. By March 18, all 387 airplanes, which served 8,600 flights each week for 59 airlines, were grounded worldwide. Boeing suspended MAX deliveries to airlines, but produced another 400 of the aircraft before halting manufacturing in January 2020.\n\n<!-- 4.  Aftermath: inquiries -->\nDuring the groundings, FAA [[Boeing 737 MAX certification|certification]] of the MAX was investigated by the [[U.S. Congress]], [[U.S. Department of Transportation|Transportation Department]], [[FBI]] and ad hoc panels, questioning whether FAA [[Organization Designation Authorization|delegation of authority]] to Boeing weakened the regulator's oversight. In addition to problems with MCAS, several [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System#Supporting systems|systems and manufacturing defects]] were also uncovered. The plane maker reversed its policy and recommended flight simulator training for all MAX pilots. The longest ever grounding of a U.S. airliner was estimated to cost Boeing $18.6 billion by March 2020.<!--ref name=Flight13mar2020-->\n\n<!-- 5.  Aftermath: final reports -->\nInvestigators published their findings on the first anniversaries of the accidents in October 2019 and March 2020. The Indonesian [[National Transportation Safety Committee|NTSC]] faulted airplane design, certification, maintenance, and flight crew actions.

MCAS --> In November 2018,  Boeing and the [[U.S. Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) emphasized to airlines that pilots could use an existing [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System#Runaway stabilizer and manual trim|recovery procedure]] if the airplane experienced an unintended [[Descent (aeronautics)#Dives|nosedive]]. Investigators suspected the cause was a new automated flight control feature on the MAX, the [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System]] (MCAS), which Boeing had not described in crew manuals or training. In December 2018, the FAA predicted more accidents if MCAS was not revised, but kept its findings private and believed the advisories to airlines were sufficient until Boeing developed a permanent solution.<section begin=\"summary\" /><noinclude>\n\n<!-- 3. Groundings -->On March 10, day of the second crash, Ethiopian Airlines grounded its remaining MAX fleet. On March 11, the [[Civil Aviation Administration of China]] ordered the first nationwide grounding, followed by most other regulators in quick succession. The FAA publicly asserted the MAX's [[Continued Airworthiness Notification to the International Community|continued airworthiness]]<nowiki/> on March 11, then grounded the airplane on March 13  after receiving evidence of accident similarities. By March 18, all 387 airplanes, which served 8,600 flights each week for 59 airlines, were grounded worldwide. Boeing suspended MAX deliveries to airlines, but produced another 400 of the aircraft before halting manufacturing in January 2020.\n\n</noinclude><!-- 4.  Aftermath: inquiries -->During the groundings, FAA [[Boeing 737 MAX certification|certification]] of the MAX was investigated by the [[U.S. Congress]], [[U.S. Department of Transportation|Transportation Department]], [[FBI]] and ad hoc panels, questioning whether FAA [[Organization Designation Authorization|delegation of authority]] to Boeing weakened the regulator's oversight. In addition to problems with MCAS, several [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System#Supporting systems|systems and manufacturing defects]] were also uncovered. The plane maker reversed its policy and recommended flight simulator training for all MAX pilots.

Aftermath: final reports -->\nInvestigators published their findings on the first anniversaries of the accidents in October 2019 and March 2020.

The Ethiopian [[Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority|ECAA]], which determined that the flight crew had attempted the recovery procedure, assigned blame to the aircraft's software design. The U.S. [[NTSB]] concluded that  malfunctions resulted in multiple cockpit alerts that likely confused the flight crews.
