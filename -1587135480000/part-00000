Organizers called the demonstrators the \"Bonus Expeditionary Force\", to echo the name of World War I's [[American Expeditionary Forces]], while the media referred to them as the \"Bonus Army\" or \"Bonus Marchers\". The demonstrators were led by Walter W. Waters, a former sergeant.\n\nMany of the war veterans had been out of work since the beginning of the [[Great Depression]]. The [[World War Adjusted Compensation Act]] of 1924 had awarded them bonuses in the form of certificates they could not redeem until 1948. Each certificate, issued to a qualified veteran soldier, bore a face value equal to the soldier's promised payment with compound interest. The principal demand of the Bonus Army was the immediate cash payment of their certificates.\n\nOn July 28, [[U.S. Attorney General]] [[William D. Mitchell]] ordered the veterans removed from all government property. Washington police met with resistance, shot at the protestors, and two veterans were wounded and later died. President [[Herbert Hoover]] then ordered the U.S. Army to clear the marchers' campsite. Army Chief of Staff General [[Douglas MacArthur]] commanded a contingent of infantry and cavalry, supported by six tanks. The Bonus Army marchers with their wives and children were driven out, and their shelters and belongings burned. \n \nA second, smaller Bonus March in 1933 at the start of the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] administration was defused in May with an offer of jobs with the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] at [[Fort Hunt, Virginia]], which most of the group accepted.

The practice derived from British legislation passed in the 1592\u201393 session of Parliament to provide medical care and maintenance for disabled veterans and bonuses for serving soldiers. Similar legislation for disabled veterans later only progressively passed by the North American colonies, beginning with Virginia in 1624.{{Citation needed|date = July 2016}}\n\nIn 1781, most of the [[Continental Army]] was [[Demobilization|demobilized]]. Two years later, hundreds of [[Pennsylvania]] war veterans [[Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783|marched on Philadelphia]], then the nation's capital, surrounded the State House, where the [[U.S. Congress]] was in session, and demanded back pay. Congress fled to [[Princeton, New Jersey]], and several weeks later, the [[U.S. Army]] expelled the war veterans from Philadelphia.{{citation needed|date = February 2018\n\n\nIn August 1776, Congress adopted the first national pension law providing half pay for life for disabled veterans. Considerable pressure was applied to expand benefits to match the British system for serving soldiers and sailors but had little support from the colonial government until mass desertions at the [[Battle of Valley Forge]] that threatened the existence of the [[Continental Army]] led [[George Washington]] to become a strong advocate. Congress progressively passed legislation from 1788 covering pensions and bonuses, eventually extending eligibility to widows in 1836.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Graves|first1=Will|title=Pension Acts An Overview of Revolutionary War Pension and Bounty Land Legislation and the Southern Campaigns Pension Transcription Project|url=http://revwarapps.org/revwar-pension-acts.htm|website=Southern Campaigns Revolutionary War Pension Statements & Rosters|accessdate=29 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nBefore World War I, the soldiers' military service bonus (adjusted for rank) was land and money; a Continental Army private received {{convert|100|acre|ha}} and $80.00 (2017: $1,968.51) at war's end, while a major general received {{convert|1100|acre|ha}}. In 1855, Congress increased the land-grant minimum to {{convert|160|acre|ha}}, and reduced the eligibility requirements to fourteen days of military service or one battle; moreover, the bonus also applied to veterans of any Indian war. The provision of land eventually became a major political issue, particularly in Tennessee where almost 40% of arable land had been given to veterans as part of their bonus. By 1860, {{convert|73500000|acre|ha}} had been issued and lack of available arable land led to the program's abandonment and replacement with a cash-only system.{{citation needed|date = July 2017}} Breaking with tradition, the veterans of the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] did not receive a bonus and after [[World War I]], that became a political matter when they received only a $60 bonus. The [[American Legion]], created in 1919, led a political movement for an additional bonus.<ref name=greenberg/>\n\n[[File:USA-Cinderella-Stamp-1932 Pay the Bonus.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cinderella stamp]] (USA, 1932) supporting the Bonus Army]]\nOn May 15, 1924, President [[Calvin Coolidge]] vetoed a bill granting bonuses to veterans of World War I, saying: \"patriotism... bought and paid for is not patriotism.\" Congress overrode his veto a few days later,<ref name=greenberg>David Greenberg, ''Calvin Coolidge'' (NY: Henry Holt, 2006), 78\u20139</ref> enacting the [[World War Adjusted Compensation Act]].

Meanwhile, veterans could borrow up to 22.5% of the certificate's face value from the fund; but in 1931, because of the [[Great Depression]], Congress increased the maximum value of such loans to 50% of the certificate's face value.<ref>Dickson and Allen, 37-8</ref> Although there was congressional support for the immediate redemption of the military service certificates, Hoover and Republican congressmen opposed such action and reasoned that the government would have to increase taxes to cover the costs of the payout and so any potential economic recovery would be slowed.<ref>Dickson and Allen, 34</ref>\n\nThe [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]] continued to press the federal government to allow the early redemption of military service certificates.<ref>Stephen R.

Organizers called the demonstrators the \"Bonus Expeditionary Force\", to echo the name of World War I's [[American Expeditionary Forces]], while the media referred to them as the \"Bonus Army\" or \"Bonus Marchers\". The demonstrators were led by Walter W. Waters, a former sergeant.\n\nMany of the war veterans had been out of work since the beginning of the [[Great Depression]]. The [[World War Adjusted Compensation Act]] of 1924 had awarded them bonuses in the form of certificates they could not redeem until 1948. Each certificate, issued to a qualified veteran soldier, bore a face value equal to the soldier's promised payment with compound interest. The principal demand of the Bonus Army was the immediate cash payment of their certificates.\n\nOn July 28, [[U.S. Attorney General]] [[William D. Mitchell]] ordered the veterans removed from all government property. Washington police met with resistance, shot at the protestors, and two veterans were wounded and later died. President [[Herbert Hoover]] then ordered the U.S. Army to clear the marchers' campsite. Army Chief of Staff General [[Douglas MacArthur]] commanded a contingent of infantry and cavalry, supported by six tanks. The Bonus Army marchers with their wives and children were driven out, and their shelters and belongings burned. \n \nA second, smaller Bonus March in 1933 at the start of the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] administration was defused in May with an offer of jobs with the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] at [[Fort Hunt, Virginia]], which most of the group accepted. Those who chose not to work for the CCC by the May 22 deadline were given transportation home.<ref>\"'Take Job in the Forest or Go Home' Is Alternative Given to Bonus Boys\", ''Middlesboro (Kentucky) Daily News'', May 17, 1933, p1; \"Bonus Marchers Weaken; Accept Jobs in Ax Corps\", ''Milwaukee Journal'', May 20, 1933, p1</ref> In 1936, Congress overrode President Roosevelt's veto and paid the veterans their bonus nine years early.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Bonus army on Capitol lawn cph.3a00515.jpg|thumb|Members of the Bonus Army camped out on the lawn of the U.S. Capitol building]]\nThe practice of war-time military bonuses began in 1776, as payment for the difference between what a soldier earned and what he could have earned had he not enlisted. The practice derived from British legislation passed in the 1592\u201393 session of Parliament to provide medical care and maintenance for disabled veterans and bonuses for serving soldiers. Similar legislation for disabled veterans later only progressively passed by the North American colonies, beginning with Virginia in 1624.{{Citation needed|date = July 2016}}\n\nIn 1781, most of the [[Continental Army]] was [[Demobilization|demobilized]]. Two years later, hundreds of [[Pennsylvania]] war veterans [[Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783|marched on Philadelphia]], then the nation's capital, surrounded the State House, where the [[U.S. Congress]] was in session, and demanded back pay. Congress fled to [[Princeton, New Jersey]], and several weeks later, the [[U.S. Army]] expelled the war veterans from Philadelphia.{{citation needed|date = February 2018}}\n\nIn August 1776, Congress adopted the first national pension law providing half pay for life for disabled veterans. Considerable pressure was applied to expand benefits to match the British system for serving soldiers and sailors but had little support from the colonial government until mass desertions at the [[Battle of Valley Forge]] that threatened the existence of the [[Continental Army]] led [[George Washington]] to become a strong advocate. Congress progressively passed legislation from 1788 covering pensions and bonuses, eventually extending eligibility to widows in 1836.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Graves|first1=Will|title=Pension Acts An Overview of Revolutionary War Pension and Bounty Land Legislation and the Southern Campaigns Pension Transcription Project|url=http://revwarapps.org/revwar-pension-acts.htm|website=Southern Campaigns Revolutionary War Pension Statements & Rosters|accessdate=29 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nBefore World War I, the soldiers' military service bonus (adjusted for rank) was land and money; a Continental Army private received {{convert|100|acre|ha}} and $80.00 (2017: $1,968.51) at war's end, while a major general received {{convert|1100|acre|ha}}. In 1855, Congress increased the land-grant minimum to {{convert|160|acre|ha}}, and reduced the eligibility requirements to fourteen days of military service or one battle; moreover, the bonus also applied to veterans of any Indian war. The provision of land eventually became a major political issue, particularly in Tennessee where almost 40% of arable land had been given to veterans as part of their bonus. By 1860, {{convert|73500000|acre|ha}} had been issued and lack of available arable land led to the program's abandonment and replacement with a cash-only system.{{citation needed|date = July 2017}} Breaking with tradition, the veterans of the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] did not receive a bonus and after [[World War I]], that became a political matter when they received only a $60 bonus. The [[American Legion]], created in 1919, led a political movement for an additional bonus.<ref name=greenberg/>\n\n[[File:USA-Cinderella-Stamp-1932 Pay the Bonus.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cinderella stamp]] (USA, 1932) supporting the Bonus Army]]\nOn May 15, 1924, President [[Calvin Coolidge]] vetoed a bill granting bonuses to veterans of World War I, saying: \"patriotism... bought and paid for is not patriotism.\" Congress overrode his veto a few days later,<ref name=greenberg>David Greenberg, ''Calvin Coolidge'' (NY: Henry Holt, 2006), 78\u20139</ref> enacting the [[World War Adjusted Compensation Act]].

Meanwhile, veterans could borrow up to 22.5% of the certificate's face value from the fund; but in 1931, because of the [[Great Depression]], Congress increased the maximum value of such loans to 50% of the certificate's face value.<ref>Dickson and Allen, 37-8</ref> Although there was congressional support for the immediate redemption of the military service certificates, Hoover and Republican congressmen opposed such action and reasoned that the government would have to increase taxes to cover the costs of the payout and so any potential economic recovery would be slowed.<ref>Dickson and Allen, 34</ref>\n\nThe [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]] continued to press the federal government to allow the early redemption of military service certificates.<ref>Stephen R.

Starring [[Robert Klein]], ''Summer Switch'' is an adaptation of the novel of the same name, the sequel to a young adult fantasy, ''[[Freaky Friday]]''. For the Scholastic Book Company, Kwapis directed his first feature film ''[[The Beniker Gang]]'', starring [[Andrew McCarthy]].\n\nKwapis' next film was ''[[Sesame Street Presents Follow That Bird]]'' ([[Warner Bros.]], 1985). The film was the big-screen debut of the [[Sesame Street]] ensemble ([[Big Bird]], [[Oscar the Grouch]], [[Count von Count|The Count]], [[Bert & Ernie]], et al.). ''Follow That Bird'' tells the story of Big Bird's quest to live with a family of his own kind; namely, birds. A social worker arranges for Big Bird to move in with a family of Dodo Birds in Oceanview, Illinois.\n\nIn 1987, Kwapis made his [[prime time]] television debut, directing an installment of [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Amazing Stories (1985 TV series)|Amazing Stories]]''.\n\nKwapis' second feature ''[[Vibes (film)|Vibes]]'' ([[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]], 1988) was made under [[Ron Howard]] and [[Brian Grazer]]'s fledgling [[Imagine Entertainment|Imagine]] banner. Written by [[Lowell Ganz]] and [[Babaloo Mandel]], ''Vibes'' is the tale of two psychics ([[Jeff Goldblum]] and [[Cyndi Lauper]]) who are enlisted by a fortune hunter ([[Peter Falk]]) to divine the whereabouts of a treasure hidden in the [[Andes]]. The film was shot on location in [[Ecuador]], and features a pan pipe-flavored score by [[James Horner]].\n\n===1990s===\nKwapis began the 1990s with a feature-film project, ''[[He Said, She Said (film)|He Said, She Said]]'' ([[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], 1991)\u2014co-directed by his now-wife [[Marisa Silver]]. The film, written by [[Brian Hohlfeld]], is a romantic comedy in which the same events are recounted twice\u2014once from each partner's point of view. The woman's ([[Elizabeth Perkins]]) portion of the film was directed by Silver and the man's ([[Kevin Bacon]]) by Kwapis. The film also features [[Sharon Stone]] and [[Nathan Lane]]. Soon after the release of ''He Said, She Said'', the film's title (coined by Silver) entered the vernacular as shorthand for any situation involving \"testimony in direct conflict\".<ref>For the etymology of the phrase, \"He said, she said\", see William Safire, \"On Language; He-Said, She-Said\", https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/12/magazine/on-language-he-said-she-said.html .</ref>\n\nKwapis then moved into series television, directing the pilot of [[HBO]]'s comedy ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]''. He directed twelve episodes of the series.\n\nKwapis also contributed two episodes to the sci-fi series ''[[Eerie, Indiana]]''.\n\nKwapis' fourth feature, ''[[Dunston Checks In]]'' ([[Twentieth Century Fox]], 1996), stars [[Jason Alexander]] as the manager of a grand hotel in [[New York City]], which is owned and operated by a tyrant in the [[Leona Helmsley]] mold ([[Faye Dunaway]]). An aristocrat of dubious origin ([[Rupert Everett]]) checks into the hotel with an orangutan jewel thief.\n\nKwapis' next film, ''[[The Beautician and the Beast]]'' ([[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], 1997), evokes the Ruritanian comedies of [[Ernst Lubitsch]]. [[Fran Drescher]] plays a New York cosmetologist who is mistakenly hired to tutor the children of the despotic president of Slovetzia ([[Timothy Dalton]]).\n\nIn the late 1990s, Kwapis directed two episodes of [[NBC]]'s short-lived cult following show ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]''.\n\n===2000s===\nIn the first decade of the 2000s, Kwapis directed nineteen episodes of [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]'', earning a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nomination for his work as a producer-director.\n\nIn 2001, Kwapis helped develop ''[[The Bernie Mac Show]]'' for Fox, directing the pilot and ten additional episodes, including the series finale, \"Bernie's Angels\". Also for Fox, Kwapis was one of the main creative forces behind ''[[Grounded for Life]]'', a hybrid comedy combining single- and multi-camera techniques. Kwapis experimented with the form even further in the pilot of ''[[Watching Ellie]]'', [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]]' follow-up to ''[[Seinfeld]]''. The distinctive pilot has a story that unfolds in real time, with an on-screen clock. Playing the role of Ellie's ex-boyfriend is [[Steve Carell]], with whom Kwapis would shortly collaborate on his next major project.\n\nIn 2005, Kwapis worked on ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'' which was an adaptation of the [[BBC]] [[mockumentary]] of the [[The Office (UK TV series)|same name]]. He directed the [[Pilot (The Office)|pilot]] and twelve additional episodes, including the 100th episode of the series, \"Company Picnic\". His work on the third-season premiere, \"[[Gay Witch Hunt]]\", earned him a second [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nomination for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series|Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series]]. He also directed the [[Finale (The Office)|series finale]].\n\nFor Showtime Independent Pictures, Kwapis wrote and directed ''[[Sexual Life]]'' (2005), loosely based on [[Arthur Schnitzler]]'s satiric story taking place in [[fin-de-si\u00e8cle]] [[Vienna]], ''[[La Ronde (play)|La Ronde]]''.\n\nKwapis' next feature was another adaptation, ''[[Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants]]'' ([[Warner Bros.]], 2006), based on the bestselling young adult novel by [[Ann Brashares]]. ''Sisterhood'', a coming-of-age story about four sixteen-year-old friends, stars [[Amber Tamblyn]], [[Alexis Bledel]], [[America Ferrera]], and [[Blake Lively]] (her screen debut).\n\nHis next feature, ''[[License to Wed]]'' (Warner Bros., 2007), follows a young couple ([[Mandy Moore]] and [[John Krasinski]]), as they embark upon an unorthodox pre-marital course, devised by a highly mischievous and somewhat perverse minister ([[Robin Williams]]). Designed to determine their compatibility, the course compresses the first ten years of marriage into one week.\n\nKwapis' follow-up was another look at romantic entanglements, ''[[He's Just Not That into You (film)|He's Just Not That into You]]'' ([[New Line Cinema]], 2009). The film is adapted from the bestselling advice book by [[Greg Behrendt]] and [[Liz Tuccillo]], which encouraged people to learn to read romantic signals correctly. The film stars [[Ben Affleck]], [[Jennifer Aniston]], [[Drew Barrymore]], [[Jennifer Connelly]], [[Kevin Connolly (actor)|Kevin Connolly]], [[Bradley Cooper]], [[Ginnifer Goodwin]], [[Scarlett Johansson]], and [[Justin Long]].\n\n===2010s===\nKwapis launched his seventh series and directed his tenth feature film in 2010. He was the executive producer and director of the pilot of ''[[Outsourced (TV series)|Outsourced]]'', a half-hour comedy for NBC. Adapted from the 2006 [[Outsourced (film)|feature film of the same name]], ''Outsourced'' tells the story of a Kansas City-based novelties company that ships all of its customer service jobs to [[India]]. The one American employee not to be fired, Todd Dempsey ([[Ben Rappaport]]), goes to [[Mumbai]] to oversee the call center.\n\nFor [[Working Title Films]], and [[Universal Pictures]], Kwapis directed the rescue adventure ''[[Big Miracle]]'', starring [[Drew Barrymore]] and [[John Krasinski]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3ia63351ea832b17bfd91d511a23a7b04c |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090609112836/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3ia63351ea832b17bfd91d511a23a7b04c |archivedate=June 9, 2009|title=Director Ken Kwapis hunts 'Whales'}}</ref> Based on a real event that took place in 1988, the film tells the tale of a small town newsman (Krasinski) and a [[Greenpeace]] volunteer (Barrymore) who are joined by rival world superpowers to save a family of [[gray whale]]s trapped in the ice of the [[Arctic Ocean]]. The film was shot during fall 2010 in Alaska and released in 2012.\n\nIn 2013, nine years after bringing the [[Pilot (The Office)|pilot]] to U.S. television, Kwapis directed the [[Finale (The Office)|series finale]] of ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]''. He also produced the half-hour [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] pilot ''[[Happyish]]'', written by [[Shalom Auslander]] and starring [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]]. The project stalled after Hoffman's death, but was eventually recast with [[Steve Coogan]]. It made its debut on Showtime in April 2015 and, in addition to producing, Kwapis directed four of its episodes.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Friedlander|first1=Whitney|title=Showtime Cancels \u2018Happyish\u2019 After One Season|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/happyish-canceled-showtime-1201548349/|website=Variety|accessdate=2 November 2016|date=24 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Kwapis directed the feature film ''[[A Walk in the Woods (film)|A Walk in the Woods]]'', based on the [[A Walk in the Woods (book)|bestselling travel memoir]] by [[Bill Bryson]]. The film stars [[Robert Redford]] and [[Nick Nolte]] as two old friends who decide to walk the 2,100-mile [[Appalachian Trail]]. The film, which was co-produced by Redford, also stars [[Emma Thompson]] and [[Mary Steenburgen]], and premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in January 2015. ''A Walk in the Woods'' was released by Broad Green on September 2, 2015.\n\nRecently, Kwapis returned to single-camera half-hour comedy and directed four episodes of [[Tig Notaro]]'s semi-autobiographical [[Internet television]] series, ''[[One Mississippi (TV series)|One Mississippi]]''\u2014two per season in 2016 and 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0477129/#director |title=Ken Kwapis - IMDb |publisher=imdb.com |date=1957-08-17 |accessdate=2017-09-21}}</ref> The show was produced by [[Amazon Studios]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Andreeva|first1=Dominic Patten, Nellie|title=\u2018One Mississippi\u2019, \u2018I Love Dick\u2019 & \u2018Jean-Claude Van Johnson\u2019 Canceled By Amazon|url=https://deadline.com/2018/01/one-mississippi-i-love-dick-jean-claude-van-johnson-canceled-amazon-1202245153/|website=Deadline|accessdate=January 18, 2018|date=January 18, 2018}}</ref> He has also directed episodes of ''[[Santa Clarita Diet]]'', a comedy starring and produced by [[Drew Barrymore]] and first released by Netflix on February 3, 2017.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/ken-kwapis/credits/182465/916115/?from=916115 |title=Ken Kwapis |website=TV Guide |orig-year=2017 |access-date=May 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Filmography ==\n===Feature films===\n* ''[[A Walk in the Woods (film)|A Walk in the Woods]]'' (2015)\n* ''[[Big Miracle]]'' (2012)\n* ''[[He's Just Not That into You (film)|He's Just Not That into You]]'' (2009)\n* ''[[License to Wed]]'' (2007)\n* ''[[The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants (film)|The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants]]'' (2005)\n* ''[[Sexual Life]]'' (2005)\n* ''[[The Beautician and the Beast]]'' (1997)\n* ''[[Dunston Checks In]]'' (1996)\n* ''[[He Said, She Said (film)|He Said, She Said]]'' (1991)\n* ''[[Vibes (film)|Vibes]]'' (1988)\n* ''[[Sesame Street Presents Follow That Bird]]'' (1985)\n* ''[[The Beniker Gang]]'' (1985)\n\n===Notable episodic television work (directing)===\n{{Div col}}\n*''BlackAF'' (2020)\n*''The Dangerous Book for Boys'' (2018)\n*''Santa Clarita Diet'' (2017-2019)\n*''One Mississippi'' (2016-2017)\n*''Happyish'' (2015)\n*''The Office'' (2005-2013)\n*''Outsourced'' (2010)\n*''Parks and Recreation'' (2010)\n*''The Bernie Mac Show'' (2001-2006)\n*''Malcolm in the Middle'' (2000-2004)\n*''Watching Ellie'' (2002)\n*''Grounded for Life'' (2001)\n*''ER'' (1999-2000)\n*''Freaks and Geeks'' (1999-2000)\n*''The Wonderful World of Disney'' (1998)\n*''Bakersfield P.D.''

Starring [[Robert Klein]], ''Summer Switch'' is an adaptation of the novel of the same name, the sequel to a young adult fantasy, ''[[Freaky Friday]]''. For the Scholastic Book Company, Kwapis directed his first feature film ''[[The Beniker Gang]]'', starring [[Andrew McCarthy]].\n\nKwapis' next film was ''[[Sesame Street Presents Follow That Bird]]'' ([[Warner Bros.]], 1985). The film was the big-screen debut of the [[Sesame Street]] ensemble ([[Big Bird]], [[Oscar the Grouch]], [[Count von Count|The Count]], [[Bert & Ernie]], et al.). ''Follow That Bird'' tells the story of Big Bird's quest to live with a family of his own kind; namely, birds. A social worker arranges for Big Bird to move in with a family of Dodo Birds in Oceanview, Illinois.\n\nIn 1987, Kwapis made his [[prime time]] television debut, directing an installment of [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Amazing Stories (1985 TV series)|Amazing Stories]]''.\n\nKwapis' second feature ''[[Vibes (film)|Vibes]]'' ([[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]], 1988) was made under [[Ron Howard]] and [[Brian Grazer]]'s fledgling [[Imagine Entertainment|Imagine]] banner. Written by [[Lowell Ganz]] and [[Babaloo Mandel]], ''Vibes'' is the tale of two psychics ([[Jeff Goldblum]] and [[Cyndi Lauper]]) who are enlisted by a fortune hunter ([[Peter Falk]]) to divine the whereabouts of a treasure hidden in the [[Andes]]. The film was shot on location in [[Ecuador]], and features a pan pipe-flavored score by [[James Horner]].\n\n===1990s===\nKwapis began the 1990s with a feature-film project, ''[[He Said, She Said (film)|He Said, She Said]]'' ([[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], 1991)\u2014co-directed by his now-wife [[Marisa Silver]]. The film, written by [[Brian Hohlfeld]], is a romantic comedy in which the same events are recounted twice\u2014once from each partner's point of view. The woman's ([[Elizabeth Perkins]]) portion of the film was directed by Silver and the man's ([[Kevin Bacon]]) by Kwapis. The film also features [[Sharon Stone]] and [[Nathan Lane]]. Soon after the release of ''He Said, She Said'', the film's title (coined by Silver) entered the vernacular as shorthand for any situation involving \"testimony in direct conflict\".<ref>For the etymology of the phrase, \"He said, she said\", see William Safire, \"On Language; He-Said, She-Said\", https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/12/magazine/on-language-he-said-she-said.html .</ref>\n\nKwapis then moved into series television, directing the pilot of [[HBO]]'s comedy ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]''. He directed twelve episodes of the series.\n\nKwapis also contributed two episodes to the sci-fi series ''[[Eerie, Indiana]]''.\n\nKwapis' fourth feature, ''[[Dunston Checks In]]'' ([[Twentieth Century Fox]], 1996), stars [[Jason Alexander]] as the manager of a grand hotel in [[New York City]], which is owned and operated by a tyrant in the [[Leona Helmsley]] mold ([[Faye Dunaway]]). An aristocrat of dubious origin ([[Rupert Everett]]) checks into the hotel with an orangutan jewel thief.\n\nKwapis' next film, ''[[The Beautician and the Beast]]'' ([[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], 1997), evokes the Ruritanian comedies of [[Ernst Lubitsch]]. [[Fran Drescher]] plays a New York cosmetologist who is mistakenly hired to tutor the children of the despotic president of Slovetzia ([[Timothy Dalton]]).\n\nIn the late 1990s, Kwapis directed two episodes of [[NBC]]'s short-lived cult following show ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]''.\n\n===2000s===\nIn the first decade of the 2000s, Kwapis directed nineteen episodes of [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]'', earning a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nomination for his work as a producer-director.\n\nIn 2001, Kwapis helped develop ''[[The Bernie Mac Show]]'' for Fox, directing the pilot and ten additional episodes, including the series finale, \"Bernie's Angels\". Also for Fox, Kwapis was one of the main creative forces behind ''[[Grounded for Life]]'', a hybrid comedy combining single- and multi-camera techniques. Kwapis experimented with the form even further in the pilot of ''[[Watching Ellie]]'', [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]]' follow-up to ''[[Seinfeld]]''. The distinctive pilot has a story that unfolds in real time, with an on-screen clock. Playing the role of Ellie's ex-boyfriend is [[Steve Carell]], with whom Kwapis would shortly collaborate on his next major project.\n\nIn 2005, Kwapis worked on ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'' which was an adaptation of the [[BBC]] [[mockumentary]] of the [[The Office (UK TV series)|same name]]. He directed the [[Pilot (The Office)|pilot]] and twelve additional episodes, including the 100th episode of the series, \"Company Picnic\". His work on the third-season premiere, \"[[Gay Witch Hunt]]\", earned him a second [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nomination for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series|Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series]]. He also directed the [[Finale (The Office)|series finale]].\n\nFor Showtime Independent Pictures, Kwapis wrote and directed ''[[Sexual Life]]'' (2005), loosely based on [[Arthur Schnitzler]]'s satiric story taking place in [[fin-de-si\u00e8cle]] [[Vienna]], ''[[La Ronde (play)|La Ronde]]''.\n\nKwapis' next feature was another adaptation, ''[[Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants]]'' ([[Warner Bros.]], 2006), based on the bestselling young adult novel by [[Ann Brashares]]. ''Sisterhood'', a coming-of-age story about four sixteen-year-old friends, stars [[Amber Tamblyn]], [[Alexis Bledel]], [[America Ferrera]], and [[Blake Lively]] (her screen debut).\n\nHis next feature, ''[[License to Wed]]'' (Warner Bros., 2007), follows a young couple ([[Mandy Moore]] and [[John Krasinski]]), as they embark upon an unorthodox pre-marital course, devised by a highly mischievous and somewhat perverse minister ([[Robin Williams]]). Designed to determine their compatibility, the course compresses the first ten years of marriage into one week.\n\nKwapis' follow-up was another look at romantic entanglements, ''[[He's Just Not That into You (film)|He's Just Not That into You]]'' ([[New Line Cinema]], 2009). The film is adapted from the bestselling advice book by [[Greg Behrendt]] and [[Liz Tuccillo]], which encouraged people to learn to read romantic signals correctly. The film stars [[Ben Affleck]], [[Jennifer Aniston]], [[Drew Barrymore]], [[Jennifer Connelly]], [[Kevin Connolly (actor)|Kevin Connolly]], [[Bradley Cooper]], [[Ginnifer Goodwin]], [[Scarlett Johansson]], and [[Justin Long]].\n\n===2010s===\nKwapis launched his seventh series and directed his tenth feature film in 2010. He was the executive producer and director of the pilot of ''[[Outsourced (TV series)|Outsourced]]'', a half-hour comedy for NBC. Adapted from the 2006 [[Outsourced (film)|feature film of the same name]], ''Outsourced'' tells the story of a Kansas City-based novelties company that ships all of its customer service jobs to [[India]]. The one American employee not to be fired, Todd Dempsey ([[Ben Rappaport]]), goes to [[Mumbai]] to oversee the call center.\n\nFor [[Working Title Films]], and [[Universal Pictures]], Kwapis directed the rescue adventure ''[[Big Miracle]]'', starring [[Drew Barrymore]] and [[John Krasinski]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3ia63351ea832b17bfd91d511a23a7b04c |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090609112836/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3ia63351ea832b17bfd91d511a23a7b04c |archivedate=June 9, 2009|title=Director Ken Kwapis hunts 'Whales'}}</ref> Based on a real event that took place in 1988, the film tells the tale of a small town newsman (Krasinski) and a [[Greenpeace]] volunteer (Barrymore) who are joined by rival world superpowers to save a family of [[gray whale]]s trapped in the ice of the [[Arctic Ocean]]. The film was shot during fall 2010 in Alaska and released in 2012.\n\nIn 2013, nine years after bringing the [[Pilot (The Office)|pilot]] to U.S. television, Kwapis directed the [[Finale (The Office)|series finale]] of ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]''. He also produced the half-hour [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] pilot ''[[Happyish]]'', written by [[Shalom Auslander]] and starring [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]]. The project stalled after Hoffman's death, but was eventually recast with [[Steve Coogan]]. It made its debut on Showtime in April 2015 and, in addition to producing, Kwapis directed four of its episodes.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Friedlander|first1=Whitney|title=Showtime Cancels \u2018Happyish\u2019 After One Season|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/happyish-canceled-showtime-1201548349/|website=Variety|accessdate=2 November 2016|date=24 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Kwapis directed the feature film ''[[A Walk in the Woods (film)|A Walk in the Woods]]'', based on the [[A Walk in the Woods (book)|bestselling travel memoir]] by [[Bill Bryson]]. The film stars [[Robert Redford]] and [[Nick Nolte]] as two old friends who decide to walk the 2,100-mile [[Appalachian Trail]]. The film, which was co-produced by Redford, also stars [[Emma Thompson]] and [[Mary Steenburgen]], and premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in January 2015. ''A Walk in the Woods'' was released by Broad Green on September 2, 2015.\n\nRecently, Kwapis returned to single-camera half-hour comedy and directed four episodes of [[Tig Notaro]]'s semi-autobiographical [[Internet television]] series, ''[[One Mississippi (TV series)|One Mississippi]]''\u2014two per season in 2016 and 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0477129/#director |title=Ken Kwapis - IMDb |publisher=imdb.com |date=1957-08-17 |accessdate=2017-09-21}}</ref> The show was produced by [[Amazon Studios]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Andreeva|first1=Dominic Patten, Nellie|title=\u2018One Mississippi\u2019, \u2018I Love Dick\u2019 & \u2018Jean-Claude Van Johnson\u2019 Canceled By Amazon|url=https://deadline.com/2018/01/one-mississippi-i-love-dick-jean-claude-van-johnson-canceled-amazon-1202245153/|website=Deadline|accessdate=January 18, 2018|date=January 18, 2018}}</ref> He has also directed episodes of ''[[Santa Clarita Diet]]'', a comedy starring and produced by [[Drew Barrymore]] and first released by Netflix on February 3, 2017.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/ken-kwapis/credits/182465/916115/?from=916115 |title=Ken Kwapis |website=TV Guide |orig-year=2017 |access-date=May 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Filmography ==\n===Feature films===\n* ''[[A Walk in the Woods (film)|A Walk in the Woods]]'' (2015)\n* ''[[Big Miracle]]'' (2012)\n* ''[[He's Just Not That into You (film)|He's Just Not That into You]]'' (2009)\n* ''[[License to Wed]]'' (2007)\n* ''[[The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants (film)|The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants]]'' (2005)\n* ''[[Sexual Life]]'' (2005)\n* ''[[The Beautician and the Beast]]'' (1997)\n* ''[[Dunston Checks In]]'' (1996)\n* ''[[He Said, She Said (film)|He Said, She Said]]'' (1991)\n* ''[[Vibes (film)|Vibes]]'' (1988)\n* ''[[Sesame Street Presents Follow That Bird]]'' (1985)\n* ''[[The Beniker Gang]]'' (1985)\n\n===Notable episodic television work (directing)===\n{{Div col}}\n*''The Dangerous Book for Boys'' (2018)\n*''Santa Clarita Diet'' (2017-)\n*''One Mississippi'' (2016-2017)\n*''Happyish'' (2015)\n*''The Office'' (2005-2013)\n*''Outsourced'' (2010)\n*''Parks and Recreation'' (2010)\n*''The Bernie Mac Show'' (2001-2006)\n*''Malcolm in the Middle'' (2000-2004)\n*''Watching Ellie'' (2002)\n*''Grounded for Life'' (2001)\n*''ER'' (1999-2000)\n*''Freaks and Geeks'' (1999-2000)\n*''The Wonderful World of Disney'' (1998)\n*''Bakersfield P.D.''

Released in 2006, it was a finalist for the [[Michael L. Printz Award]].\n\nThe novel includes an appendix by [[Daniel Biss]], a close friend of Green, that explains some of the more complex equations used by the main character, Colin Singleton.\n\n==Plot summary==\nColin Singleton, a child prodigy living in [[Chicago]], fears he will not maintain his genius as an adult. Over the span of his life, Colin has dated nineteen girls named Katherine, all spelled in that manner.  After being dumped by his girlfriend, Katherine XIX, Colin is longing to feel whole, and longing to matter. He hopes to become a genius by having a \"[[eureka effect|eureka]]\" moment.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, and before college, Colin's best and only friend, Hassan Harbish, convinces him to go on a road trip to take his mind off the breakup. Colin goes, hoping to find his \"eureka\" moment. After reaching a rural [[Tennessee]] town called Gutshot , they visit the supposed resting place of  [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]]. There, they meet Lindsey Lee Wells and her mother Hollis, whose family runs a local textile mill. Hollis allows Colin and Hassan to stay with her family and offers them a summer job interviewing the town's residents and assembling an oral history of Gutshot.\n\nColin begins to like Lindsey, though he is foiled by her boyfriend, Colin Lyford (he and Hassan call him TOC, \"the other Colin\"). Colin is still chasing his eureka moment, finally finding it in the theorem he created called the \"Theorem of Underlying Katherine Predictability\". It determines the curve of any relationship based on several factors of the personalities of the two people in a relationship. His theorem eventually works for all but one of his past relationships with a Katherine\u2014which the novel explores.\n\nWhile the back stories of Colin\u2019s life play out, Hassan finds a girlfriend, Katrina, a friend of Lindsey\u2019s. Their relationship is cut short when Colin and Hassan catch Katrina having sex with Lyford while on a feral hog hunt with Lindsey, her friends and Lyford's father. A fight between Lyford and all the surrounding acquaintances begins when Lindsey finds out that he has been cheating on her. Injured in the fight, Colin anagrams the Archduke's name while in the grave yard to dull the pain, and realizes that it is actually Lindsey's great-grandfather, named Fred N. Dinzanfar, who is buried in the tomb.\n\nColin finds Lindsey at her secret hideout in a cave, where he tells her the story of every Katherine he has ever loved. Lindsey tells him how she does not feel sad but instead slightly relieved by Lyford's affair. They discuss what it means to them to \"matter\" and eventually confess their love for each other. As their relationship continues, Colin decides to use his dating formula to determine whether he and Lindsey will last. The graph reveals that they will only last for four more days. Lindsey slips a note under his door, four days later, stating that she cannot be his girlfriend because she is in love with Hassan. But she leaves a P.S. stating that she is joking. Colin realizes that his theorem cannot predict the future of a relationship; it can only shed light on why a relationship failed. Despite this, Colin is content with not \"mattering\". Hassan says that he is applying for two college classes, which Colin has been trying to convince him to do throughout the book. The story ends with the trio driving past the restaurant they were originally planning to go to, because Colin, Lindsey, and Hassan realize that they can just keep driving; there is nothing stopping them from continuing on.\n\n==Main characters==\n;Colin Singleton: Colin Singleton is an anagram-loving seventeen-year-old boy who is depressed. Though he was a child-prodigy with an IQ of over 200, he has not yet become a \"genius\". Colin finds everything interesting, especially things that other people seem not to care much about. Because of this, it is difficult for people to relate to him. After only dating Katherines, Colin breaks the streak by dating Lindsey Lee Wells, whom he met on his road trip with Hassan. Throughout the novel Colin feels as though there is a hole in his stomach, and he is looking to fill it. Colin spends his time striving to be unique, but with Lindsey's help, ends up coming to the realization that he is \"not-unique in the very best way possible.\"\n;Hassan Harbish: Hassan Harbish is Colin Singleton's lazy, funny, and slightly overweight best, and only friend. Though he is smart and has been accepted to college, Hassan takes a year off. At first he does not seem to plan on furthering his education. He convinces Colin to go on a road trip to break out of his depression. Hassan is Muslim and prays regularly, acting with strict religiosity, until he dates Katrina. Hassan is an integral part of Colin's journey to find his true identity.\n;Lindsey Lee Wells: Lindsey Lee Wells meets Colin Singleton and Hassan Harbish on their road trip in Gutshot, Tennessee. She is a paramedic-in-training who also gives tours of Gutshot. When Lindsey first appears in the novel, she is dating Colin Lyford. However, she does not feel that she is truly herself until she starts hanging around Colin. Like him, Lindsey seems to be struggling with her identity. Inspired by Colin's ability to always be himself, Lindsey finally becomes herself. She also becomes Singleton's girlfriend after her break-up with Lyford.\n;Hollis Wells: She is Lindsey's mother and an extreme workaholic who is very kind to the people who work at her factory.\n\n==Style and format==\nThe novel is written in a [[third-person narrative]]. Green used third person to create empathy for Colin. In a blog post, Green wrote that the novel \"needed to be written in third person, because it's about a guy whose brain does not lend itself to narratives, and who struggles to tell stories in ways other people find interesting.\"<ref name=\"Katherines questions\"/>\n\nThe story includes many footnotes that become an essential part to understanding Colin's brain and how it works. Green says that the footnotes \"function as a kind of competing narrative that comments upon and\u2014for lack of a better word\u2014problematizes the central narrative.\"<ref name=\"Katherines questions\">{{cite web|last1=Green|first1=John|title=Questions about An Abundance of Katherines|url=http://johngreenbooks.com/katherines-questions/|website=John Green Books|publisher=WordPress|accessdate=24 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505003359/http://johngreenbooks.com/katherines-questions/|archive-date=5 May 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> ''An Abundance of Katherines'' is a work of fiction that includes many mathematical terms and academic language. With the footnotes and the appendix that is at the end of the novel, Green gives his readers \"a way of attempting to achieve precision and clarity\" of the story in general, but more specifically, Colin's mind.<ref name=\"Katherines questions\"/>\n\nThe book consists of 19 chapters to highlight the number 19. These chapters include Colin's flashbacks, which are \"meant to reflect the relationship we have between chronological narrative and emotional narrative.\"<ref name=\"Katherines questions\"/> This format is also known as a [[non-linear narrative]].\n\n==Symbols==\n;Archduke Franz Ferdinand: Franz Ferdinand is an anagram of Lindsey's great grandpa's name, Fred N. Dinzanfar. Ferdinand becomes a symbol of what is most important to Colin: mattering. Though Ferdinand is famous, he did not really do much; he is famous for being shot. \"While some people are remembered, others are forgotten, and a lot of times it doesn't matter whether we try to do something noteworthy or not. History gets to decide, ultimately, whether we're remembered.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shmoop Editorial Team|title=Archduke Franz Ferdinand in An Abundance of Katherines|url=http://www.shmoop.com/an-abundance-of-katherines/archduke-franz-ferdinand-symbol.html|website=Shmoop|publisher=Shmoop University, Inc|access-date=17 April 2020}}</ref>\n;Lindsey's Cave: Lindsey's cave is her \"super, incredibly top secret location that no one on Earth knows about.\"{{sfn|Green|2006|p=141}}{{full citation needed|date=April 2020}} Colin is the only person she shows the cave to. This symbolizes the comfort and trust in their relationship. It also stands for Lindsey's privacy. Green has acknowledged that the cave can also be seen as a representation for Lindsey's vagina.

Released in 2006, it was a finalist for the [[Michael L. Printz Award]].\n\nThe novel includes an appendix by [[Daniel Biss]], a close friend of Green, that explains some of the more complex equations used by the main character, Colin Singleton.\n\n==Plot summary==\nColin Singleton, a child prodigy living in [[Chicago]], fears he will not maintain his genius as an adult. Over the span of his life, Colin has dated nineteen girls named Katherine, all spelled in that manner.  After being dumped by his girlfriend, Katherine XIX, Colin is longing to feel whole, and longing to matter. He hopes to become a genius by having a \"[[eureka effect|eureka]]\" moment.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, and before college, Colin's best and only friend, Hassan Harbish, convinces him to go on a road trip to take his mind off the breakup. Colin goes, hoping to find his \"eureka\" moment. After reaching a rural [[Tennessee]] town called Gutshot , they visit the supposed resting place of  [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]]. There, they meet Lindsey Lee Wells and her mother Hollis, whose family runs a local textile mill. Hollis allows Colin and Hassan to stay with her family and offers them a summer job interviewing the town's residents and assembling an oral history of Gutshot.\n\nColin begins to like Lindsey, though he is foiled by her boyfriend, Colin Lyford (he and Hassan call him TOC, \"the other Colin\"). Colin is still chasing his eureka moment, finally finding it in the theorem he created called the \"Theorem of Underlying Katherine Predictability\". It determines the curve of any relationship based on several factors of the personalities of the two people in a relationship. His theorem eventually works for all but one of his past relationships with a Katherine\u2014which the novel explores.\n\nWhile the back stories of Colin\u2019s life play out, Hassan finds a girlfriend, Katrina, a friend of Lindsey\u2019s. Their relationship is cut short when Colin and Hassan catch Katrina having sex with Lyford while on a feral hog hunt with Lindsey, her friends and Lyford's father. A fight between Lyford and all the surrounding acquaintances begins when Lindsey finds out that he has been cheating on her. Injured in the fight, Colin anagrams the Archduke's name while in the grave yard to dull the pain, and realizes that it is actually Lindsey's great-grandfather, named Fred N. Dinzanfar, who is buried in the tomb.\n\nColin finds Lindsey at her secret hideout in a cave, where he tells her the story of every Katherine he has ever loved. Lindsey tells him how she does not feel sad but instead slightly relieved by Lyford's affair. They discuss what it means to them to \"matter\" and eventually confess their love for each other. As their relationship continues, Colin decides to use his dating formula to determine whether he and Lindsey will last. The graph reveals that they will only last for four more days. Lindsey slips a note under his door, four days later, stating that she cannot be his girlfriend because she is in love with Hassan. But she leaves a P.S. stating that she is joking. Colin realizes that his theorem cannot predict the future of a relationship; it can only shed light on why a relationship failed. Despite this, Colin is content with not \"mattering\". Hassan says that he is applying for two college classes, which Colin has been trying to convince him to do throughout the book. The story ends with the trio driving past the restaurant they were originally planning to go to, because Colin, Lindsey, and Hassan realize that they can just keep driving; there is nothing stopping them from continuing on.\n\n==Main characters==\n;Colin Singleton: Colin Singleton is an anagram-loving seventeen-year-old boy who is depressed. Though he was a child-prodigy with an IQ of over 200, he has not yet become a \"genius\". Colin finds everything interesting, especially things that other people seem not to care much about. Because of this, it is difficult for people to relate to him. After only dating Katherines, Colin breaks the streak by dating Lindsey Lee Wells, whom he met on his road trip with Hassan. Throughout the novel Colin feels as though there is a hole in his stomach, and he is looking to fill it. Colin spends his time striving to be unique, but with Lindsey's help, ends up coming to the realization that he is \"not-unique in the very best way possible.\"\n;Hassan Harbish: Hassan Harbish is Colin Singleton's lazy, funny, and slightly overweight best, and only friend. Though he is smart and has been accepted to college, Hassan takes a year off. At first he does not seem to plan on furthering his education. He convinces Colin to go on a road trip to break out of his depression. Hassan is Muslim and prays regularly, acting with strict religiosity, until he dates Katrina. Hassan is an integral part of Colin's journey to find his true identity.\n;Lindsey Lee Wells: Lindsey Lee Wells meets Colin Singleton and Hassan Harbish on their road trip in Gutshot, Tennessee. She is a paramedic-in-training who also gives tours of Gutshot. When Lindsey first appears in the novel, she is dating Colin Lyford. However, she does not feel that she is truly herself until she starts hanging around Colin. Like him, Lindsey seems to be struggling with her identity. Inspired by Colin's ability to always be himself, Lindsey finally becomes herself. She also becomes Singleton's girlfriend after her break-up with Lyford.\n;Hollis Wells: She is Lindsey's mother and an extreme workaholic who is very kind to the people who work at her factory.\n\n==Style and format==\nThe novel is written in a [[third-person narrative]]. Green used third person to create empathy for Colin. In a blog post, Green wrote that the novel \"needed to be written in third person, because it's about a guy whose brain does not lend itself to narratives, and who struggles to tell stories in ways other people find interesting.\"<ref name=\"Katherines questions\"/>\n\nThe story includes many footnotes that become an essential part to understanding Colin's brain and how it works. Green says that the footnotes \"function as a kind of competing narrative that comments upon and\u2014for lack of a better word\u2014problematizes the central narrative.\"<ref name=\"Katherines questions\">{{cite web|last1=Green|first1=John|title=Questions about An Abundance of Katherines|url=http://johngreenbooks.com/katherines-questions/|website=John Green Books|publisher=WordPress|accessdate=24 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505003359/http://johngreenbooks.com/katherines-questions/|archive-date=5 May 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> ''An Abundance of Katherines'' is a work of fiction that includes many mathematical terms and academic language. With the footnotes and the appendix that is at the end of the novel, Green gives his readers \"a way of attempting to achieve precision and clarity\" of the story in general, but more specifically, Colin's mind.<ref name=\"Katherines questions\"/>\n\nThe book consists of 19 chapters to highlight the number 19. These chapters include Colin's flashbacks, which are \"meant to reflect the relationship we have between chronological narrative and emotional narrative.\"<ref name=\"Katherines questions\"/> This format is also known as a [[non-linear narrative]].\n\n==Symbols==\n;Archduke Franz Ferdinand: Franz Ferdinand is an anagram of Lindsey's great grandpa's name, Fred N. Dinzanfar. Ferdinand becomes a symbol of what is most important to Colin: mattering. Though Ferdinand is famous, he did not really do much; he is famous for being shot. \"While some people are remembered, others are forgotten, and a lot of times it doesn't matter whether we try to do something noteworthy or not. History gets to decide, ultimately, whether we're remembered.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shmoop Editorial Team|title=Archduke Franz Ferdinand in An Abundance of Katherines|url=http://www.shmoop.com/an-abundance-of-katherines/archduke-franz-ferdinand-symbol.html|website=Shmoop|publisher=Shmoop University, Inc|access-date=17 April 2020}}</ref>\n;Lindsey's Cave: Lindsey's cave is her \"super, incredibly top secret location that no one on Earth knows about.\"{{sfn|Green|2006|p=141}}{{full citation needed|date=April 2020}} Colin is the only person she shows the cave to. This symbolizes the comfort and trust in their relationship. It also stands for Lindsey's privacy. Green has acknowledged that the cave can also be seen as a representation for Lindsey's vagina. He says that Colin's romantic journey with Lindsey \"is a journey away from the (phallic) obelisk and toward the (sapphic) cave, and in the end only in the place associated with femininity is Colin able to become authentically himself with someone else.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Green|first1=John|title=Questions about An Abundance of Katherines|url=http://johngreenbooks.com/katherines-questions/#symbols|website=John Green Books|publisher=WordPress|accessdate=1 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505003359/http://johngreenbooks.com/katherines-questions/#symbols|archive-date=5 May 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n''An Abundance of Katherines'' was a 2007 [[Michael L.
