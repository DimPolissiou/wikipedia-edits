See WP:ENGVAR. --> an English [[progressive rock]] band formed in London in 1968. King Crimson have been influential both on the early 1970s progressive rock movement and many contemporary artists. Although the band has undergone numerous [[#Personnel|formations]] throughout its history, [[Robert Fripp]] is the only constant member of the group and is considered the band's leader and driving force. The band has earned a large [[cult following]].<ref name=\"AMGBIO\">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=mn0000076057|tab=biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=King Crimson Biography|accessdate=19 August 2007|website=AllMusic|last=Eder |first=Bruce}}</ref> They were ranked No. 87 on [[VH1]]'s ''100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxm64mApR05CJVCePlmcUFluSZyiAvKZ8|title=VH1 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock \u2013 YouTube|website=YouTube|accessdate=19 May 2018}}</ref> Although considered to be a seminal progressive rock band (a genre characterised by extended instrumental sections and complex song structures), they have often distanced themselves from the genre: as well as influencing several generations of progressive and psychedelic rock bands, they have also been an influence on subsequent alternative metal, hardcore and experimental/noise musicians.\n\nDeveloped from the unsuccessful psychedelic pop trio [[Giles, Giles and Fripp]], the initial King Crimson were key to the formation of early progressive rock, strongly influencing and altering the music of contemporaries such as [[Yes (band)|Yes]] and [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]].<ref name=\"AU\">{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/goldcoast/stories/s1255632.htm|title=In the Court of the Crimson King|accessdate=29 August 2007|publisher=ABC Gold & Tweed Coasts (abc.net.au) |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060527123553/http://www.abc.net.au/goldcoast/stories/s1255632.htm |archivedate = 27 May 2006}}</ref> Their debut album, ''[[In the Court of the Crimson King]]'' (1969), remains their most successful and influential release, with its elements of [[jazz]], classical and [[experimental music]].<ref>[[#refBuckley2003|Buckley 2003]], p. 477, \"''Opening with the cataclysmic heavy-metal of \"21st Century Schizoid Man\", and closing with the cathedral-sized title track,''\"</ref> Their success increased following an opening act performance for [[the Rolling Stones]] at [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], London, in 1969. Following ''[[In the Wake of Poseidon]]'' (1970) and the less successful [[chamber jazz]]-inspired ''[[Lizard (album)|Lizard]]'' (1970), and ''[[Islands (King Crimson album)|Islands]]'' (1971), the group reformatted and changed their instrumentation (swapping out saxophone in favour of violin and unusual percussion) in order to develop their own take on European rock improvisation, reaching a new creative peak on ''[[Larks' Tongues in Aspic]]'' (1973), ''[[Starless and Bible Black]]'' (1974) and ''[[Red (King Crimson album)|Red]]'' (1974). Fripp disbanded the group in 1974.\n\nIn 1981, King Crimson reformed with another change in musical direction and instrumentation (incorporating, for the first time, a mixture of British and American personnel plus doubled guitar and influences taken from [[gamelan]], [[post-punk]] and New York [[Minimalist music|minimalism]]). This lasted for three years, resulting in the trio of albums ''[[Discipline (King Crimson album)|Discipline]]'' (1981), ''[[Beat (King Crimson album)|Beat]]'' (1982) and ''[[Three of a Perfect Pair]]'' (1984). Following a decade-long hiatus, Fripp revived the group as an expanded \"Double Trio\" sextet in 1994, mingling its mid-\u201870s and 1980s approaches with new creative options available via [[MIDI]] technology. This resulted in another three-year cycle of activity including the release of ''[[Thrak]]'' (1995). King Crimson reunited again in 2000 as a more [[alternative metal]]-oriented quartet (or \"Double Duo\"), releasing ''[[The Construkction of Light]]'' in 2000 and ''[[The Power to Believe]]'' in 2003: after further personnel shuffles, the band expanded to a double-drummer quintet for a 2008 tour celebrating their 40th anniversary.\n\nFollowing another hiatus between 2009 and 2012, King Crimson reformed once again in 2013; this time as a septet (and, later, octet) with an unusual three-drumkit frontline and the return of saxophone/flute to the lineup for the first time since 1972. This current version of King Crimson has continued to tour and to release live albums, significantly rearranging and reinterpreting music from across the band's entire previous career.\n\nSince 1997, several musicians have pursued aspects of the band's work and approaches through a series of related bands collectively referred to as [[ProjeKcts]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Formation ===\nIn August 1967, brothers [[Michael Giles]] (drums) and [[Peter Giles (musician)|Peter Giles]] (bass), who had been professional musicians in various jobbing bands since their mid-teens in [[Dorset]], England, advertised for a singing organist to join their new group.<ref>{{cite web | url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=mn0000657298|tab=biography|pure_url=yes}} | title=Giles, Giles and Fripp | accessdate=8 August 2007 | last=Eder|first=Bruce |website=AllMusic}}</ref><ref name=\"Voyage-PT\">{{cite web|url=http://www.elephant-talk.com/intervws/fripp-mu.htm|title=Interview with Robert Fripp|accessdate=19 August 2007|work=Musician magazine (archived page from elephant-talk.com)|year=1984 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050208100954/http://www.elephant-talk.com/intervws/fripp-mu.htm |archivedate=8 February 2005}}</ref> Fellow Dorset musician [[Robert Fripp]]&nbsp;\u2013 a guitarist who did not sing&nbsp;\u2013 responded and the trio formed the band [[Giles, Giles and Fripp]].

The band's music drew on a wide range of influences provided by all five group members. These elements included romantic- and modernist-era classical music, the psychedelic rock spearheaded by [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[folk music|folk]], [[jazz]], military music (partially inspired by McDonald's stint as an army musician), ambient improvisation, [[Victoriana]] and British pop.\n\nAfter playing shows across England, the band toured the US with various pop and rock acts. Their first show was at [[Goddard College]] in [[Plainfield, Vermont]]. While their original sound astounded contemporary audiences and critics,<ref name=AMGBIO /> creative tensions were already developing within the band. Giles and McDonald, still striving to cope with King Crimson's rapid success and the realities of touring life, became uneasy with the band's direction. Although he was neither the dominant composer in the band nor the frontman, Fripp was very much the band's driving force and spokesman, leading King Crimson into progressively darker and more intense musical areas. McDonald and Giles, now favouring a lighter and more romantic style of music, became increasingly uncomfortable with their position and resigned from the band during the US tour. To salvage what he saw as the most important elements of King Crimson, Fripp offered to resign himself, but McDonald and Giles declared that the band was \"more (him) than them\" and that they should therefore be the ones to leave.<ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" /> The line-up played their last show at the [[Fillmore West]] in San Francisco on 16 December 1969.<ref name=epitaph /> Live recordings of the tour were released in 1997 on ''[[Epitaph (King Crimson album)|Epitaph]]''.\n\n=== 1970\u20131971: the \"interregnum\" \u2013 ''In the Wake of Poseidon'' and ''Lizard'' ===\n\nAfter their first US tour, King Crimson was in a state of flux with various line-up changes, thwarted tour plans, and difficulties in finding a satisfactory musical direction. This period has subsequently been referred to as the \"[[interregnum]]\" \u2013 a nickname implying that the \"King\" (King Crimson) was not properly in place during this time.<ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" /> Fripp became the only remaining musician in the band, with Sinfield expanding his creative role to playing synthesizers.\n\nFripp and Sinfield recorded the second King Crimson album, ''[[In the Wake of Poseidon]]'', in 1970 with the Giles brothers hired back as the session rhythm section, and with jazz pianist [[Keith Tippett]] and Circus saxophonist [[Mel Collins]] as guest musicians. The group considered hiring [[Elton John]] to be the singer, but decided against the idea.<ref name=\"ETFAQ\">{{cite web|url=http://www.elephant-talk.com/faq/et-faq.txt|title=King Crimson FAQ|accessdate=29 August 2007|publisher=Elephant Talk (archived page from elephant-talk.com) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050828134638/http://www.elephant-talk.com/faq/et-faq.txt |archivedate=28 August 2005}}</ref> Lake then agreed to sing on the album in exchange for receiving King Crimson's [[public address system|PA equipment]],<ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" /> except on \"Cadence and Cascade\", which is sung by Fripp's friend [[Gordon Haskell]]. Though Tippett was offered band membership, he preferred to remain as a studio collaborator, performing with the band for a single gig.<ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" /> Upon its release in May 1970, ''In the Wake of Poseidon'' reached No. 4 in the UK and No. 31 in the US. It received some criticism from those who thought it sounded too similar to their first album.<ref name=AMGBIO /> With no musicians to perform material from their new album, Fripp and Sinfield persuaded Haskell to join as singer and bassist and recruited [[Andrew McCulloch (drummer)|Andy McCulloch]] as drummer, retaining Collins as saxophonist, flautist and occasional keyboard player.<ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" />\n\nDuring the writing sessions for the third album, ''[[Lizard (album)|Lizard]]'',<ref name=AMGBIO /> Haskell and McCulloch had no say in the direction of the material, since Fripp and Sinfield wrote the album themselves, bringing in Tippett, [[Mark Charig]] on [[cornet]], [[Nick Evans (trombonist)|Nick Evans]] on trombone, and Robin Miller on [[oboe]] and [[cor anglais]] as additional musicians. Haskell sang and played bass. [[Jon Anderson]] of [[Yes (band)|Yes]] was also brought in to sing the first part of the album's title track, \"Prince Rupert Awakes\",<ref name=AMGBIO /> which Fripp and Sinfield considered to be outside Haskell's range and style.<ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" /> ''Lizard'' featured stronger avant-garde jazz and chamber-classical influences than previous albums, as well as Sinfield's upfront experiments with processing and distorting sound through the [[EMS VCS 3]] synthesiser. It also featured complex lyrics from Sinfield, including a coded song about the break-up of [[the Beatles]], with almost the entire second side taken up by a predominantly instrumental chamber suite describing a medieval battle and its outcome. Released in December 1970, ''Lizard'' reached No. 29 in the UK and No. 113 in the US. Described retrospectively as an \"acquired taste\",<ref name=AMGBIO /> ''Lizard'' was certainly not to the taste of the more rhythm-and-blues-oriented Haskell and McCulloch, both of whom found the music difficult to relate to. As a result, Haskell quit the band acrimoniously after refusing to sing live with distortion and electronic effects. McCulloch also departed,<ref name=AMGBIO /><ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" /> leaving Fripp and Sinfield to recruit new members once more.\n\n=== 1971\u20131972: the ''Islands'' band ===\n\nAfter a search for new musicians, Fripp and Sinfield secured a returning Collins and [[Ian Wallace (drummer)|Ian Wallace]] on drums. Auditions for a singer included those from [[Bryan Ferry]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/king-crimson-in-the-wake-of-poseidon/|title=Revisiting King Crimson's Second LP, 'In the Wake of Poseidon'|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|accessdate=19 May 2018}}</ref> and John Gaydon, the band's manager.

Though he had not played bass before, Burrell had played enough rhythm guitar to assist him in learning the instrument.<ref name=AMGBIO /><ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" /> With the line-up complete, King Crimson toured in 1971 for the first time since 1969. The concerts were well received, but the musical and lifestyle differences of Collins, Wallace, and Burrell began to alienate the drug-free Fripp, who began to withdraw socially from his bandmates, creating further tension.<ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" />\n\nIn 1971, the new King Crimson formation recorded ''[[Islands (King Crimson album)|Islands]]''. Loosely influenced by [[Miles Davis]]'s orchestral collaborations with [[Gil Evans]] and [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', the album also showed signs of a split in styles between Sinfield (who favoured the softer and more textural jazz-folk approach and wanted the band to move in a Miles Davis direction) and Fripp (who was drawn more towards the harsher instrumental style exemplified by the instrumental \"Sailor's Tale\", with its dramatic Mellotron and banjo-inspired guitar technique). ''Islands'' also featured the band's only experiment with a string ensemble on \"Prelude: Song of the Gulls\" and the raunchy rhythm-and-blues-inspired \"Ladies of the Road\". A hint of trouble to come came when one member of the band allegedly described the more delicate and meditative parts of ''Islands'' as \"airy-fairy shit\".<ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" /> Released in December 1971, ''Islands'' charted at No. 30 in the UK and No. 76 in the US. Following a period of touring ''Islands'', Fripp asked Sinfield to leave the band,<ref name=AMGBIO /> citing musical differences and a loss of faith in his partner's ideas.<ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" /> The remaining band broke up acrimoniously in rehearsals shortly afterward, owing to Fripp's refusal to incorporate other members' compositions into the band's repertoire. He later cited this as \"quality control\", with the idea that King Crimson would perform the \"right kind\" of music.<ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" />\n\nKing Crimson reformed to fulfil touring commitments in 1972, with the intention of disbanding afterwards.<ref name=AMGBIO /> Recordings from various North American dates between January and February 1972 were released as ''[[Earthbound (King Crimson album)|Earthbound]]'' in June 1972,<ref name=AMGBIO /> noted and criticised for its sub-par sound quality and playing style that occasionally veered towards [[funk]], with [[scat singing]] on the improvised pieces.<ref name=\"BBCMUSIC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/release/n3qv/|title=Earthbound, USA & Thrak|accessdate=29 August 2007|publisher=[[BBC Music]] (bbc.co.uk)}}</ref><ref name=\"EBOUND\">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=mw0000224180|pure_url=yes}}|title=Earthbound|accessdate=29 August 2007|website=AllMusic|first=Lindsay |last=Planer }}</ref> By this time, a definite musical rift between Fripp and the rest of the band existed, since Wallace, Burrell and Collins favoured a more rhythm-and-blues style.<ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" /> Though personal relations improved during the 1972 tour (to the point where most of the band wished to continue), Fripp opted to part company with the existing band and to restructure King Crimson with new members, since he felt the current members wouldn't be able to play the new material he had in mind.<ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" />\n\n=== 1972\u20131975: the \"European improvisers\" \u2013 ''Larks' Tongues in Aspic'', ''Starless and Bible Black'', ''Red'', and hiatus ===\n{{Quote box|style=padding:10px;|quote=\"It was going to be an interesting ride when ...

In addition to bass guitar, Levin used the [[Chapman Stick]], a ten-string polyphonic two-handed [[tapping]] guitar instrument that has a bass and treble range and which he played in an \"utterly original style\".<ref name=NYTimes>{{cite news|last=|first =|title=Why Robert Fripp Resurrected King Crimson|pages=|language=|work=The New York Times |date=November 1981|url=}}</ref> Bruford experimented with cymbal-less acoustic kits and a [[Simmons SDS-V]] electronic drum kit. The band's songs were shorter in comparison to previous King Crimson albums, and very much shaped by Belew's pop sensibilities and quirky approach to writing lyrics. Though the band's previous taste for improvisation was now tightly reined in, one instrumental (\"The Sheltering Sky\") emerged from group rehearsals; while the noisy, half-spoken/half-shouted \"Indiscipline\" was a partially-written, part-improvised piece created in order to give Bruford a chance to escape from the strict rhythmic demands of the rest of the album and to play against the beat in any way that he could.<ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" /> Released in September 1981, ''Discipline'' reached No. 41 in the UK and No. 45 in the US.\n\nIn June 1982, King Crimson followed ''Discipline'' with ''[[Beat (King Crimson album)|Beat]]'' (the first King Crimson album recorded with the same band line-up as the album preceding it).<ref name=MM82>{{cite news|last=|first =|title=Article|work=|pages=|language=|publisher=[[Melody Maker]]|date=19 June 1982|url=}}</ref> None of the members of the group produced the record; Davies undertook production duties himself.<ref name=MM82 /> The album had a loosely linked theme of the [[Beat Generation]] and its writings,<ref name=NME82>{{cite news|last=|first =|title=Article|pages=|language=|work=New Musical Express |location=UK|date=3 July 1982|url=}}</ref> reflected in song titles such as \"Neal and Jack and Me\" (inspired by [[Neal Cassady]] and [[Jack Kerouac]]), \"The Howler\" (inspired by [[Allen Ginsberg]]'s \"[[Howl]]\") and \"Sartori in Tangier\" (inspired by [[Paul Bowles]]). Fripp asked Belew to read Kerouac's novel ''[[On the Road]]''<ref name=ETFAQ /> for inspiration, and the album contained themes of travel, disorientation and loneliness. While the album was noticeably poppier than ''Discipline'', it featured the harsh, atonal and improvised \"Requiem\".\n\nRecording ''Beat'' was faced with tension with Belew suffering high stress levels over his duties as front man, lead singer, and principal songwriter. On one occasion, he clashed with Fripp and ordered him out of the studio.<ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" /><ref name=brufordautobiography /> After differences were resolved, and while ''Beat'' reached No. 39 in the UK and No. 52 in the US, King Crimson resumed touring.  \"Heartbeat\" was released as a single which peaked at No. 57 on the ''Billboard'' [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock]] chart. Around this time the band released the VHS-only '\"The Noise: Live in Frejus\" (DGMVC2), a record of a show played at the Arena, [[Frejus]], France on 27 August 1982. (This video is now on DVD as part of the compilation [[Neal and Jack and Me]].)\n\nKing Crimson's next album, ''[[Three of a Perfect Pair]]'', was recorded in 1983 and released in March 1984. Having encountered difficulty in both writing and determining a direction for the album, the band chose to record and sequence it as a \"left side\" \u2014 four of the band's poppier songs plus an instrumental \u2014 and a \"right side\" (experimental work including extended and atonal improvisations in the tradition of the mid-1970s band, plus as the third part of \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\"). ''Three of a Perfect Pair'' peaked at No. 30 in the UK and No. 58 in the US, with \"[[Three of a Perfect Pair (song)|Three of a Perfect Pair]]\" and \"[[Sleepless (King Crimson song)|Sleepless]]\" being released as singles. The 2001 remaster of the album included \"the other side\", a collection of remixes and improvisation out-takes plus Levin's tongue-in-cheek vocal piece, \"The King Crimson Barbershop\". The last concert of the ''Three of a Perfect Pair'' tour, at the [[Spectrum (Montreal)|Spectrum]] in Montreal, Canada on 11 July 1984, was recorded and released in 1998 as ''[[Absent Lovers: Live in Montreal]]''.\n\n{{Quote box|style=padding:10px;|quote=\"Robert broke up the group, again, for the umpteenth time, dwelling at length, I suppose on our lack of imagination, ability, direction and a thousand other things we were doubtless missing.

Bruford and Belew expressed some frustration over this; Belew recalled the first he had heard of the split was when he read about it in a report in ''Musician'' magazine. Despite these circumstances, the musicians remained on fairly amicable terms. Belew would later refer to the band \"taking a break\" that ultimately lasted for ten years.\n\n=== 1994\u20131999: the Double Trio \u2013 ''Vroooom'', ''THRAK'', and the ProjeKcts ===\nIn the early 1990s, Belew met with Fripp in England with an interest in a reformed King Crimson. Two years later, in 1992, Fripp established the [[Discipline Global Mobile]] (DGM) record label with producer [[David Singleton]]: this would subsequently be the main home for Fripp's work, with main album releases distributed to larger record companies, affording Fripp and his associates greater freedom and more control over their work.\n\nAfter a tour with [[David Sylvian]] in 1993 (who declined an offer to join Crimson), Fripp began to assemble a new version of the band, a union between the band's previous incarnation and the Sylvian & Fripp group: he was joined with Belew, Levin, Bruford, Chapman Stick player [[Trey Gunn]] (a [[Guitar Craft]] alumnus), and drummer [[Pat Mastelotto]] (who replaced the first choice, [[Jerry Marotta]]). Fripp explained the six-member formation was to be a \"Double Trio\" with two guitarists, two bassists, and two drummers, to explore a different style of music. Bruford later said he lobbied his own way into the band, believing that King Crimson was very much \"his gig\", and that Fripp had come up with the philosophical explanation later. One of the conditions Fripp had imposed on Bruford regarding his return was to give up all creative control to Fripp.<ref name=brufordautobiography />\n\nFollowing rehearsals in [[Woodstock, New York]], the group released the [[extended play]] ''[[Vrooom]]'' in October 1994. This revealed the new King Crimson sound, which featured elements of the interlocking guitars on ''Discipline'' and the heavy rock feel of ''Red'',<ref name=\"THRAK\">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=mw0000125655|pure_url=yes}}|title=Thrak|accessdate=29 August 2007|website=AllMusic|first=Daniel |last=Gioffre}}</ref> but also involved a greater use of ambient electronic sound and ideas from industrial music. In contrast, many of the actual songs \u2013 mostly written or finalised by Belew \u2013 displayed stronger elements of 1960s pop than before \u2013 in particular, a [[The Beatles|Beatles]] influence (although Bruford would also refer to the band as sounding like \"a dissonant [[The Shadows (band)|Shadows]] on steroids\"<ref name=brufordautobiography />). As with previous line-ups, new technology was used including [[MIDI]] and the [[Warr Guitar|Warr tap guitar]] with which Gunn replaced the Stick. King Crimson toured the album from 28 September 1994 in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]; following concerts were released on the double live ''[[B'Boom: Live in Argentina]]'' in 1995.\n\n{{Quote box|style=padding:10px;|quote=\"The meaning of ''THRAK'' ... the first one is: a sudden and precise impact moving from direction and commitment in service of an aim ...

Instead, the six members (including Bruford) opted to work in four smaller groups (or \"fraKctalisations\", according to Fripp) known as the [[ProjeKcts]]. This enabled the group to continue developing musical ideas and searching for Crimson's next direction without the practical difficulty and expense of convening all six members at once. In 1998 and 1999, the first four ProjeKcts played live in the US, Japan, and the UK and released recordings that showed a high degree of free improvisation.<ref name=RSBIO /> These have been collectively described by music critic [[J. D.

At the same time, Levin's commitments as a session and touring musician forced him to take an indefinite break from the band. The remaining members (Fripp, Belew, Gunn and Mastelotto) reconvened as a \"Double Duo\" to write and record ''[[The Construkction of Light]]''<ref name=DGMBIO /> in Belew's basement and garage near [[Nashville]]. Released in May 2000, the album reached No. 129 in the UK. All of the pieces were metallic and harsh in sound, similar to the work of contemporary [[alternative metal]]. They featured a distinct electronic texture, a heavy processed drum sound from Mastelotto, Gunn continuing on Warr Guitar but now taking over the bass role, and a different take on the interlocked guitar sound that the band had used since the 1980s. With the exception of a parodic industrial blues (sung by Belew through a voice changer under the pseudonym of \"Hooter J. Johnson\"), the songs were unrelentingly complex and challenging to the listener, with plenty of rhythmic displacement to add to the harsh textures.

Reuter and Mastelotto also play together as a duo (originally called Tuner), for which they have been known to rework the mid-1980s King Crimson instrumental \"Industry\" live.\n\nBetween 2011 and 2014, Stick Men and Adrian Belew's Power Trio band (Belew plus drummer Tobias Ralph and bass player [[Julie Slick]]) joined forces to play and tour as [[ProjeKcts#The Crimson ProjeKCt (2011\u20132014)|The Crimson ProjeKCt]], covering the music made during Belew's tenure as King Crimson frontman and principal songwriter. The two groups still (in 2019) perform together from time to time, usually under names like \"Belew, Levin, Mastelotto and friends\" or \"Tony Levin and friends\".\n\nDuring his solo career (including performance with the Power Trio), Adrian Belew has performed versions of certain King Crimson songs written predominantly by himself, such as \"Dinosaur,\" as well as ensemble pieces like \"Frame by Frame\" and \"Neurotica,\". Post-Crimson, he has also performed live versions of King Crimson songs which he neither wrote nor performed on when originally recorded (in particular when he has played with Eddie Jobson), such as \"Red\" or \"Larks' Tongues In Aspic, Pt.

Following ''[[In the Wake of Poseidon]]'' (1970) and the less successful [[chamber jazz]]-inspired ''[[Lizard (album)|Lizard]]'' (1970), and ''[[Islands (King Crimson album)|Islands]]'' (1971), the group reformatted and changed their instrumentation (swapping out saxophone in favour of violin and unusual percussion) in order to develop their own take on European rock improvisation, reaching a new creative peak on ''[[Larks' Tongues in Aspic]]'' (1973), ''[[Starless and Bible Black]]'' (1974) and ''[[Red (King Crimson album)|Red]]'' (1974). Fripp disbanded the group in 1974.\n\nIn 1981, King Crimson reformed with another change in musical direction and instrumentation (incorporating, for the first time, a mixture of British and American personnel plus doubled guitar and influences taken from [[gamelan]], [[post-punk]] and New York [[Minimalist music|minimalism]]). This lasted for three years, resulting in the trio of albums ''[[Discipline (King Crimson album)|Discipline]]'' (1981), ''[[Beat (King Crimson album)|Beat]]'' (1982) and ''[[Three of a Perfect Pair]]'' (1984). Following a decade-long hiatus, Fripp revived the group as an expanded \"Double Trio\" sextet in 1994, mingling its mid-\u201870s and 1980s approaches with new creative options available via [[MIDI]] technology. This resulted in another three-year cycle of activity including the release of ''[[Thrak]]'' (1995). King Crimson reunited again in 2000 as a more [[alternative metal]]-oriented quartet (or \"Double Duo\"), releasing ''[[The Construkction of Light]]'' in 2000 and ''[[The Power to Believe]]'' in 2003: after further personnel shuffles, the band expanded to a double-drummer quintet for a 2008 tour celebrating their 40th anniversary.\n\nFollowing another hiatus between 2009 and 2012, King Crimson reformed once again in 2013; this time as a septet (and, later, octet) with an unusual three-drumkit frontline and the return of saxophone/flute to the lineup for the first time since 1972. This current version of King Crimson has continued to tour and to release live albums, significantly rearranging and reinterpreting music from across the band's entire previous career.\n\nSince 1997, several musicians have pursued aspects of the band's work and approaches through a series of related bands collectively referred to as [[ProjeKcts]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Formation ===\nIn August 1967, brothers [[Michael Giles]] (drums) and [[Peter Giles (musician)|Peter Giles]] (bass), who had been professional musicians in various jobbing bands since their mid-teens in [[Dorset]], England, advertised for a singing organist to join their new group.<ref>{{cite web | url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=mn0000657298|tab=biography|pure_url=yes}} | title=Giles, Giles and Fripp | accessdate=8 August 2007 | last=Eder|first=Bruce |website=AllMusic}}</ref><ref name=\"Voyage-PT\">{{cite web|url=http://www.elephant-talk.com/intervws/fripp-mu.htm|title=Interview with Robert Fripp|accessdate=19 August 2007|work=Musician magazine (archived page from elephant-talk.com)|year=1984 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050208100954/http://www.elephant-talk.com/intervws/fripp-mu.htm |archivedate=8 February 2005}}</ref> Fellow Dorset musician [[Robert Fripp]]&nbsp;\u2013 a guitarist who did not sing&nbsp;\u2013 responded and the trio formed the band [[Giles, Giles and Fripp]].

The band's music drew on a wide range of influences provided by all five group members. These elements included romantic- and modernist-era classical music, the psychedelic rock spearheaded by [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[folk music|folk]], [[jazz]], military music (partially inspired by McDonald's stint as an army musician), ambient improvisation, [[Victoriana]] and British pop.\n\nAfter playing shows across England, the band toured the US with various pop and rock acts. Their first show was at [[Goddard College]] in [[Plainfield, Vermont]]. While their original sound astounded contemporary audiences and critics,<ref name=AMGBIO /> creative tensions were already developing within the band. Giles and McDonald, still striving to cope with King Crimson's rapid success and the realities of touring life, became uneasy with the band's direction. Although he was neither the dominant composer in the band nor the frontman, Fripp was very much the band's driving force and spokesman, leading King Crimson into progressively darker and more intense musical areas. McDonald and Giles, now favouring a lighter and more romantic style of music, became increasingly uncomfortable with their position and resigned from the band during the US tour. To salvage what he saw as the most important elements of King Crimson, Fripp offered to resign himself, but McDonald and Giles declared that the band was \"more (him) than them\" and that they should therefore be the ones to leave.<ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" /> The line-up played their last show at the [[Fillmore West]] in San Francisco on 16 December 1969.<ref name=epitaph /> Live recordings of the tour were released in 1997 on ''[[Epitaph (King Crimson album)|Epitaph]]''.\n\n=== 1970\u20131971: the \"interregnum\" \u2013 ''In the Wake of Poseidon'' and ''Lizard'' ===\n\nAfter their first US tour, King Crimson was in a state of flux with various line-up changes, thwarted tour plans, and difficulties in finding a satisfactory musical direction. This period has subsequently been referred to as the \"[[interregnum]]\" \u2013 a nickname implying that the \"King\" (King Crimson) was not properly in place during this time.<ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" /> Fripp became the only remaining musician in the band, with Sinfield expanding his creative role to playing synthesizers.\n\nFripp and Sinfield recorded the second King Crimson album, ''[[In the Wake of Poseidon]]'', in 1970 with the Giles brothers hired back as the session rhythm section, and with jazz pianist [[Keith Tippett]] and Circus saxophonist [[Mel Collins]] as guest musicians. The group considered hiring [[Elton John]] to be the singer, but decided against the idea.<ref name=\"ETFAQ\">{{cite web|url=http://www.elephant-talk.com/faq/et-faq.txt|title=King Crimson FAQ|accessdate=29 August 2007|publisher=Elephant Talk (archived page from elephant-talk.com) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050828134638/http://www.elephant-talk.com/faq/et-faq.txt |archivedate=28 August 2005}}</ref> Lake then agreed to sing on the album in exchange for receiving King Crimson's [[public address system|PA equipment]],<ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" /> except on \"Cadence and Cascade\", which is sung by Fripp's friend [[Gordon Haskell]]. Though Tippett was offered band membership, he preferred to remain as a studio collaborator, performing with the band for a single gig.<ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" /> Upon its release in May 1970, ''In the Wake of Poseidon'' reached No. 4 in the UK and No. 31 in the US. It received some criticism from those who thought it sounded too similar to their first album.<ref name=AMGBIO /> With no musicians to perform material from their new album, Fripp and Sinfield persuaded Haskell to join as singer and bassist and recruited [[Andrew McCulloch (drummer)|Andy McCulloch]] as drummer, retaining Collins as saxophonist, flautist and occasional keyboard player.<ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" />\n\nDuring the writing sessions for the third album, ''[[Lizard (album)|Lizard]]'',<ref name=AMGBIO /> Haskell and McCulloch had no say in the direction of the material, since Fripp and Sinfield wrote the album themselves, bringing in Tippett, [[Mark Charig]] on [[cornet]], [[Nick Evans (trombonist)|Nick Evans]] on trombone, and Robin Miller on [[oboe]] and [[cor anglais]] as additional musicians. Haskell sang and played bass. [[Jon Anderson]] of [[Yes (band)|Yes]] was also brought in to sing the first part of the album's title track, \"Prince Rupert Awakes\",<ref name=AMGBIO /> which Fripp and Sinfield considered to be outside Haskell's range and style.<ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" /> ''Lizard'' featured stronger avant-garde jazz and chamber-classical influences than previous albums, as well as Sinfield's upfront experiments with processing and distorting sound through the [[EMS VCS 3]] synthesiser. It also featured complex lyrics from Sinfield, including a coded song about the break-up of [[the Beatles]], with almost the entire second side taken up by a predominantly instrumental chamber suite describing a medieval battle and its outcome. Released in December 1970, ''Lizard'' reached No. 29 in the UK and No. 113 in the US. Described retrospectively as an \"acquired taste\",<ref name=AMGBIO /> ''Lizard'' was certainly not to the taste of the more rhythm-and-blues-oriented Haskell and McCulloch, both of whom found the music difficult to relate to. As a result, Haskell quit the band acrimoniously after refusing to sing live with distortion and electronic effects. McCulloch also departed,<ref name=AMGBIO /><ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" /> leaving Fripp and Sinfield to recruit new members once more.\n\n=== 1971\u20131972: the ''Islands'' band ===\n\nAfter a search for new musicians, Fripp and Sinfield secured a returning Collins and [[Ian Wallace (drummer)|Ian Wallace]] on drums. Auditions for a singer included those from [[Bryan Ferry]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/king-crimson-in-the-wake-of-poseidon/|title=Revisiting King Crimson's Second LP, 'In the Wake of Poseidon'|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|accessdate=19 May 2018}}</ref> and John Gaydon, the band's manager.

Though he had not played bass before, Burrell had played enough rhythm guitar to assist him in learning the instrument.<ref name=AMGBIO /><ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" /> With the line-up complete, King Crimson toured in 1971 for the first time since 1969. The concerts were well received, but the musical and lifestyle differences of Collins, Wallace, and Burrell began to alienate the drug-free Fripp, who began to withdraw socially from his bandmates, creating further tension.<ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" />\n\nIn 1971, the new King Crimson formation recorded ''[[Islands (King Crimson album)|Islands]]''. Loosely influenced by [[Miles Davis]]'s orchestral collaborations with [[Gil Evans]] and [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', the album also showed signs of a split in styles between Sinfield (who favoured the softer and more textural jazz-folk approach and wanted the band to move in a Miles Davis direction) and Fripp (who was drawn more towards the harsher instrumental style exemplified by the instrumental \"Sailor's Tale\", with its dramatic Mellotron and banjo-inspired guitar technique). ''Islands'' also featured the band's only experiment with a string ensemble on \"Prelude: Song of the Gulls\" and the raunchy rhythm-and-blues-inspired \"Ladies of the Road\".

In addition to bass guitar, Levin used the [[Chapman Stick]], a ten-string polyphonic two-handed [[tapping]] guitar instrument that has a bass and treble range and which he played in an \"utterly original style\".<ref name=NYTimes>{{cite news|last=|first =|title=Why Robert Fripp Resurrected King Crimson|pages=|language=|work=The New York Times |date=November 1981|url=}}</ref> Bruford experimented with cymbal-less acoustic kits and a [[Simmons SDS-V]] electronic drum kit. The band's songs were shorter in comparison to previous King Crimson albums, and very much shaped by Belew's pop sensibilities and quirky approach to writing lyrics. Though the band's previous taste for improvisation was now tightly reined in, one instrumental (\"The Sheltering Sky\") emerged from group rehearsals; while the noisy, half-spoken/half-shouted \"Indiscipline\" was a partially-written, part-improvised piece created in order to give Bruford a chance to escape from the strict rhythmic demands of the rest of the album and to play against the beat in any way that he could.<ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" /> Released in September 1981, ''Discipline'' reached No. 41 in the UK and No. 45 in the US.\n\nIn June 1982, King Crimson followed ''Discipline'' with ''[[Beat (King Crimson album)|Beat]]'' (the first King Crimson album recorded with the same band line-up as the album preceding it).<ref name=MM82>{{cite news|last=|first =|title=Article|work=|pages=|language=|publisher=[[Melody Maker]]|date=19 June 1982|url=}}</ref> None of the members of the group produced the record; Davies undertook production duties himself.<ref name=MM82 /> The album had a loosely linked theme of the [[Beat Generation]] and its writings,<ref name=NME82>{{cite news|last=|first =|title=Article|pages=|language=|work=New Musical Express |location=UK|date=3 July 1982|url=}}</ref> reflected in song titles such as \"Neal and Jack and Me\" (inspired by [[Neal Cassady]] and [[Jack Kerouac]]), \"The Howler\" (inspired by [[Allen Ginsberg]]'s \"[[Howl]]\") and \"Sartori in Tangier\" (inspired by [[Paul Bowles]]). Fripp asked Belew to read Kerouac's novel ''[[On the Road]]''<ref name=ETFAQ /> for inspiration, and the album contained themes of travel, disorientation and loneliness. While the album was noticeably poppier than ''Discipline'', it featured the harsh, atonal and improvised \"Requiem\".\n\nRecording ''Beat'' was faced with tension with Belew suffering high stress levels over his duties as front man, lead singer, and principal songwriter. On one occasion, he clashed with Fripp and ordered him out of the studio.<ref name=\"InTheCourtOfKingCrimson\" /><ref name=brufordautobiography /> After differences were resolved, and while ''Beat'' reached No. 39 in the UK and No. 52 in the US, King Crimson resumed touring.  \"Heartbeat\" was released as a single which peaked at No. 57 on the ''Billboard'' [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock]] chart. Around this time the band released the VHS-only '\"The Noise: Live in Frejus\" (DGMVC2), a record of a show played at the Arena, [[Frejus]], France on 27 August 1982. (This video is now on DVD as part of the compilation [[Neal and Jack and Me]].)\n\nKing Crimson's next album, ''[[Three of a Perfect Pair]]'', was recorded in 1983 and released in March 1984. Having encountered difficulty in both writing and determining a direction for the album, the band chose to record and sequence it as a \"left side\" \u2014 four of the band's poppier songs plus an instrumental \u2014 and a \"right side\" (experimental work including extended and atonal improvisations in the tradition of the mid-1970s band, plus as the third part of \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\"). ''Three of a Perfect Pair'' peaked at No. 30 in the UK and No. 58 in the US, with \"[[Three of a Perfect Pair (song)|Three of a Perfect Pair]]\" and \"[[Sleepless (King Crimson song)|Sleepless]]\" being released as singles. The 2001 remaster of the album included \"the other side\", a collection of remixes and improvisation out-takes plus Levin's tongue-in-cheek vocal piece, \"The King Crimson Barbershop\". The last concert of the ''Three of a Perfect Pair'' tour, at the [[Spectrum (Montreal)|Spectrum]] in Montreal, Canada on 11 July 1984, was recorded and released in 1998 as ''[[Absent Lovers: Live in Montreal]]''.\n\n{{Quote box|style=padding:10px;|quote=\"Robert broke up the group, again, for the umpteenth time, dwelling at length, I suppose on our lack of imagination, ability, direction and a thousand other things we were doubtless missing.

Bruford and Belew expressed some frustration over this; Belew recalled the first he had heard of the split was when he read about it in a report in ''Musician'' magazine. Despite these circumstances, the musicians remained on fairly amicable terms. Belew would later refer to the band \"taking a break\" that ultimately lasted for ten years.\n\n=== 1994\u20131999: the Double Trio \u2013 ''Vroooom'', ''THRAK'', and the ProjeKcts ===\nIn the early 1990s, Belew met with Fripp in England with an interest in a reformed King Crimson. Two years later, in 1992, Fripp established the [[Discipline Global Mobile]] (DGM) record label with producer [[David Singleton]]: this would subsequently be the main home for Fripp's work, with main album releases distributed to larger record companies, affording Fripp and his associates greater freedom and more control over their work.\n\nAfter a tour with [[David Sylvian]] in 1993 (who declined an offer to join Crimson), Fripp began to assemble a new version of the band, a union between the band's previous incarnation and the Sylvian & Fripp group: he was joined with Belew, Levin, Bruford, Chapman Stick player [[Trey Gunn]] (a [[Guitar Craft]] alumnus), and drummer [[Pat Mastelotto]] (who replaced the first choice, [[Jerry Marotta]]). Fripp explained the six-member formation was to be a \"Double Trio\" with two guitarists, two bassists, and two drummers, to explore a different style of music. Bruford later said he lobbied his own way into the band, believing that King Crimson was very much \"his gig\", and that Fripp had come up with the philosophical explanation later. One of the conditions Fripp had imposed on Bruford regarding his return was to give up all creative control to Fripp.<ref name=brufordautobiography />\n\nFollowing rehearsals in [[Woodstock, New York]], the group released the [[extended play]] ''[[Vrooom]]'' in October 1994. This revealed the new King Crimson sound, which featured elements of the interlocking guitars on ''Discipline'' and the heavy rock feel of ''Red'',<ref name=\"THRAK\">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=mw0000125655|pure_url=yes}}|title=Thrak|accessdate=29 August 2007|website=AllMusic|first=Daniel |last=Gioffre}}</ref> but also involved a greater use of ambient electronic sound and ideas from industrial music. In contrast, many of the actual songs \u2013 mostly written or finalised by Belew \u2013 displayed stronger elements of 1960s pop than before \u2013 in particular, a [[The Beatles|Beatles]] influence (although Bruford would also refer to the band as sounding like \"a dissonant [[The Shadows (band)|Shadows]] on steroids\"<ref name=brufordautobiography />).

Instead, the six members (including Bruford) opted to work in four smaller groups (or \"fraKctalisations\", according to Fripp) known as the [[ProjeKcts]]. This enabled the group to continue developing musical ideas and searching for Crimson's next direction without the practical difficulty and expense of convening all six members at once. In 1998 and 1999, the first four ProjeKcts played live in the US, Japan, and the UK and released recordings that showed a high degree of free improvisation.<ref name=RSBIO /> These have been collectively described by music critic [[J.

At the same time, Levin's commitments as a session and touring musician forced him to take an indefinite break from the band. The remaining members (Fripp, Belew, Gunn and Mastelotto) reconvened as a \"Double Duo\" to write and record ''[[The Construkction of Light]]''<ref name=DGMBIO /> in Belew's basement and garage near [[Nashville]]. Released in May 2000, the album reached No. 129 in the UK. All of the pieces were metallic and harsh in sound, similar to the work of contemporary [[alternative metal]]. They featured a distinct electronic texture, a heavy processed drum sound from Mastelotto, Gunn continuing on Warr Guitar but now taking over the bass role, and a different take on the interlocked guitar sound that the band had used since the 1980s. With the exception of a parodic industrial blues (sung by Belew through a voice changer under the pseudonym of \"Hooter J. Johnson\"), the songs were unrelentingly complex and challenging to the listener, with plenty of rhythmic displacement to add to the harsh textures. The album contains the [[Larks' Tongues in Aspic (instrumental)#Part IV|fourth instalment]] of \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\". It received a negative reception for lacking new ideas.<ref name=\"TCOL\">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=mw0000066513|pure_url=yes}}|title=The ConstruKction of Light|accessdate=29 August 2007|website=AllMusic|first=Jason |last=Nickey }}</ref> The band recorded an album at the same time, under the name of [[ProjeKct X]], called ''[[Heaven and Earth (ProjeKct X album)|Heaven and Earth]]''.<ref name=\"HE\">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=mw0001158736|pure_url=yes}}|title=Heaven and Earth|accessdate=29 August 2007|website=AllMusic| first=Kelvin|last= Hayes}}</ref> Conceived and led by Mastelotto and Gunn, with Fripp and Belew playing subsidiary roles, it was a further development of the polyrhythmic/dance music approach adopted in the ProjeKcts.<ref name=\"HE\" />\n\n[[File:Adrian Belew (2006).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Belew performing in 2006]]\nKing Crimson toured to support both albums, including double bill shows with [[Tool (band)|Tool]].
