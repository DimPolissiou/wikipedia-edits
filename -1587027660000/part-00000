It is controlled by the Greek government, which owns a majority of the issued shares (51,12%).\n\n==History==\nPPC was founded by the Greek government in 1950. Its main purpose was to plan and apply a national [[energy]] policy which, through the exploitation of the domestic products and resources, would distribute cheap [[electric power]] to all Greek citizens. PPC started the integration of all the small local grids to the national interconnected grid. Furthermore, the corporation resolved the purchase of all the small private and local electric power production units.\n\nToday, PPC Group consists of 3 subsidiary companies PPC or DEI S.A., the [[Hellenic Electricity Distribution Network Operator]] (HEDNO or DEDDIE) S.A. and PPC RENEWABLES S.A.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dei.gr/en/i-dei/i-etairia/omilos-dei-ae|title=PPC Group - PPC S.A.|website=www.dei.gr|accessdate=13 February 2020}}</ref>. Even if HEDNO S.A. (the Greek DSO) is owned by PPC, HEDNO S.A. operates independently according to L.4001/2011 and in compliance with 2009/72/EC EU Directive relative to the electricity market organization <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.deddie.gr/en/deddie/i-etaireia/profil/|title=Profile - HEDNO S.A.|website=https://www.deddie.gr/|accessdate=13 February 2020}}</ref>.\n\n==Shareholders==\n\nIn the past five years there has been no change in the share capital of the Company. \nThe Company\u2019s shares are traded in the \u00abLarge Cap\u00bb category of the Athens Stock Exchange (ATHEX), while in the London Stock Exchange they are traded in the form of [[global depository receipt]]s (GDRs).\n\nThe Company\u2019s shareholding structure as of 7 September 2018 was as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dei.gr/en/i-dei/enimerwsi-ependutwn/xrimatistiriaka-stoixeia/metoxiki-sunthesi|title=PPC's Shareholding Structure - PPC S.A.|website=www.dei.gr|accessdate=17 August 2017}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The channel served the [[Chicago metropolitan area]].\n\nThe channel was formerly owned by [[Tribune Media]] (through its [[Tribune Broadcasting]] subsidiary) since its debut; it was one of three flagship media properties owned by the company, alongside radio station [[WGN (AM)|WGN]] (720 AM) and CLTV's news partners, [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] [[WGN-TV]] (channel 9) until 2019 after [[Nexstar Media Group]] acquired Tribune Media. The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', owned by [[Tribune Publishing]] since Tribune's publishing assets were spun-off in summer 2014, along with Tribune's suburban partners, continued to contribute some CLTV content until its closure. CLTV operated from the studios of WGN-TV on Bradley Place in Chicago's [[North Center, Chicago|North Center]] neighborhood.\n\nNexstar Media Group announced in December 16, 2019 that it will shut down CLTV on December 31, 2019, which occurred at 6:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Central Time Zone|CST]].<ref>[https://www.robertfeder.com/2019/12/16/nexstar-media-pulling-plug-cltv-cable-news-channel/ Nexstar Media pulling the plug on CLTV cable news channel], RobertFeder.com, 16 December 2019, Retrieved 17 December 2019.</ref><ref>[https://wgntv.com/2019/12/31/cltv-says-goodbye-after-27-years/]</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe channel began operations on January 1, 1993, originally broadcasting out of studios located in the Chicago suburb of [[Oak Brook, Illinois|Oak Brook]]. On February 4, 2009, the Tribune Company announced that it would combine CLTV's operations with the company's [[flagship (broadcasting)|flagship]] [[television station]] WGN-TV, though CLTV would continue to operate as a standalone cable news channel. As a result of the integration of the channel's operations, CLTV relocated from its Oak Brook studio to WGN's Bradley Place studios on the northwest side of Chicago. The move became official on August 28, 2009, when editorial control of the cable channel was also turned over to WGN-TV's news department.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/towerticker/2009/02/wgntv-cltv-to-integrate-operations.html|title=WGN-TV, CLTV to integrate operations|last=Rosenthal|first=Phil|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=February 4, 2009|accessdate=December 7, 2017}}</ref><ref>[http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/chi-thu-brf2-tribune-cltv-feb05,0,4952301.story Tribune Co. combining operations of WGN-TV and cable outlet CLTV], ''Chicago Tribune'', February 5, 2009</ref>\n\nPrior to this, Tribune integrated CLTV's weather operations with channel 9, and [[WGN (AM)|WGN]] radio entered into a content agreement with WGN-TV to provide weather forecasts for that station. Upon the completion of the merger, CLTV received a new on-air logo, implemented new graphics based on those used by WGN-TV for that station's newscasts and upgraded to [[high-definition television|high definition]] broadcasts.\n\nIn July 2009, CLTV laid off more than 20 staffers, including on-air personalities [[Aaron Baskerville]], [[Randi Belisomo]] and [[Regina Waldrop]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=9999200034717|title=CLTV cuts staffers|last=Saphir|first=Ann|newspaper=Crain's Chicago Business|publisher=[[Crain Communications]]|date=July 10, 2009|accessdate=December 7, 2017}}</ref> Other staffers cut were in sales and production.\n\n==Programming==\nAt the time of its closure, CLTV aired live news on weekdays continuously 4:00&nbsp;a.m. to 9:00&nbsp;a.m., 2:00&nbsp;p.m. to 3:00&nbsp;p.m., and 7:00&nbsp;p.m. to 9:00&nbsp;a.m. (also weekends), with half-hour updates at 10:00&nbsp;a.m. (also weekends), 12:30&nbsp;p.m. and 1:30&nbsp;a.m. (also weekends). On weekends live news aired from 4:00&nbsp;a.m. to 5:30&nbsp;a.m., 7:30&nbsp;a.m. to 9:00&nbsp;a.m., 12:00&nbsp;p.m. to 4:00&nbsp;p.m., 7:00&nbsp;p.m. to 9:00&nbsp;p.m., and 10:00&nbsp;p.m. to midnight. All news broadcasts were structured into a traditional wheel format of news, [[traffic reporting|traffic and transit]], [[weather forecasting|weather]], sports, [[entertainment journalism|entertainment]] and feature reports. Any programming was subject to interruption due to breaking local news events or significant national events that necessitated longer-form coverage.\n\nOther programs featured on CLTV included:\n*''Politics Tonight'', a nightly political discussion program hosted by WGN-TV political editor Paul Lisnek, airing weeknights at 5:30&nbsp;p.m. (repeats at 10:00&nbsp;p.m.);\n*Rebroadcasts of WGN-TV newscasts including one-hour of that station's two-hour midday (the noon hour repeating at 1 p.m. each weekday), weekend morning (the 8 a.m. hour repeating at 9 a.m. on Saturdays and Sundays), 9 and 10 p.m. (repeats at 10:30 and 11:30&nbsp;p.m. weeknights, respectively plus the 9 p.m. repeat at 10 p.m. Sundays), the Saturday 5 p.m. newscast (which airs at 6 p.m. Saturdays) and bi-weekly [[public affairs (broadcasting)|public affairs]] programs ''Adelante, Chicago'' and ''People to People'';\n*Special live half-hour editions of WGN-TV's 9 p.m. newscast that are broadcast exclusively on CLTV during instances in which WGN-TV telecasts an [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], [[National Hockey League|NHL]] or [[Major League Baseball]] event being held on the [[Pacific Time Zone|West Coast]] that is scheduled for a 9 p.m. CT start time locally (an additional half-hour newscast airs live on WGN-TV following the game).

CLTV was also used during the existence of [[FSN Chicago|SportsChannel and Fox Sports Net Chicago]] as the overflow feeds of those channels before the launch of CSN Chicago. By the second quarter of 2010, Comcast's Chicago systems transitioned to [[digital cable|digital]]-only transmission of its channel lineup (requiring a digital converter box or [[CableCard]]-compliant receiver to receive programming), and NBCSC+ has been transitioned to its own channel, along with a NBCSC+HD feed.\n\n===Partnerships with other Tribune Company properties===\nDue to CLTV's ownership by the Tribune Company (and its successor, Nexstar), the channel shares content and reporting from other news operations run by the company. News footage is shared extensively between CLTV and WGN-TV. All of CLTV's weather coverage is provided by WGN-TV. Columnists from the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' (as mentioned above, now separately owned since mid-2014) also provide in-depth reporting for many feature stories seen on CLTV. [[Metromix]], a joint venture between [[tronc]] and the [[Gannett|Gannett Company]] that provides local arts and cultural coverage and is available as the cultural section in the ''Tribune'', produced ''Metromix Weekend'' for CLTV.

The channel served the [[Chicago metropolitan area]].\n\nThe channel was formerly owned by [[Tribune Media]] (through its [[Tribune Broadcasting]] subsidiary) since its debut; it was one of three flagship media properties owned by the company, alongside radio station [[WGN (AM)|WGN]] (720 AM) and CLTV's news partners, [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] [[WGN-TV]] (channel 9) until 2019 after [[Nexstar Media Group]] acquired Tribune Media. The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', owned by [[Tribune Publishing]] since Tribune's publishing assets were spun-off in summer 2014, along with Tribune's suburban partners, continued to contribute some CLTV content until its closure. CLTV operated from the studios of WGN-TV on Bradley Place in Chicago's [[North Center, Chicago|North Center]] neighborhood.\n\nNexstar Media Group announced in December 16, 2019 that it will shut down CLTV on December 31, 2019, which occurred at 6:00 p.m. [[Central Time Zone|CST]].<ref>[https://www.robertfeder.com/2019/12/16/nexstar-media-pulling-plug-cltv-cable-news-channel/ Nexstar Media pulling the plug on CLTV cable news channel], RobertFeder.com, 16 December 2019, Retrieved 17 December 2019.</ref><ref>[https://wgntv.com/2019/12/31/cltv-says-goodbye-after-27-years/]</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe channel began operations on January 1, 1993, originally broadcasting out of studios located in the Chicago suburb of [[Oak Brook, Illinois|Oak Brook]].

As a result of the integration of the channel's operations, CLTV relocated from its Oak Brook studio to WGN's Bradley Place studios on the northwest side of Chicago. The move became official on August 28, 2009, when editorial control of the cable channel was also turned over to WGN-TV's news department.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/towerticker/2009/02/wgntv-cltv-to-integrate-operations.html|title=WGN-TV, CLTV to integrate operations|last=Rosenthal|first=Phil|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=February 4, 2009|accessdate=December 7, 2017}}</ref><ref>[http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/chi-thu-brf2-tribune-cltv-feb05,0,4952301.story Tribune Co. combining operations of WGN-TV and cable outlet CLTV], ''Chicago Tribune'', February 5, 2009</ref>\n\nPrior to this, Tribune integrated CLTV's weather operations with channel 9, and [[WGN (AM)|WGN]] radio entered into a content agreement with WGN-TV to provide weather forecasts for that station. Upon the completion of the merger, CLTV received a new on-air logo, implemented new graphics based on those used by WGN-TV for that station's newscasts and upgraded to [[high-definition television|high definition]] broadcasts.\n\nIn July 2009, CLTV laid off more than 20 staffers, including on-air personalities [[Aaron Baskerville]], [[Randi Belisomo]] and [[Regina Waldrop]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=9999200034717|title=CLTV cuts staffers|last=Saphir|first=Ann|newspaper=Crain's Chicago Business|publisher=[[Crain Communications]]|date=July 10, 2009|accessdate=December 7, 2017}}</ref> Other staffers cut were in sales and production.\n\n==Programming==\nAt the time of its closure, CLTV aired live news on weekdays continuously 4:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m., 2:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m., and 7:00 p.m. to 9:00 a.m. (also weekends), with half-hour updates at 10:00 a.m. (also weekends), 12:30 p.m. and 1:30 a.m. (also weekends).

All news broadcasts were structured into a traditional wheel format of news, [[traffic reporting|traffic and transit]], [[weather forecasting|weather]], sports, [[entertainment journalism|entertainment]] and feature reports. Any programming was subject to interruption due to breaking local news events or significant national events that necessitated longer-form coverage.\n\nOther programs featured on CLTV included:\n*''Politics Tonight'', a nightly political discussion program hosted by WGN-TV political editor Paul Lisnek, airing weeknights at 5:30&nbsp;p.m. (repeats at 10:00&nbsp;p.m.);\n*Rebroadcasts of WGN-TV newscasts including one-hour of that station's two-hour midday (the noon hour repeating at 1 p.m. each weekday), weekend morning (the 8 a.m. hour repeating at 9 a.m. on Saturdays and Sundays), 9 and 10 p.m. (repeats at 10:30 and 11:30&nbsp;p.m. weeknights, respectively plus the 9 p.m. repeat at 10 p.m. Sundays), the Saturday 5 p.m. newscast (which airs at 6 p.m. Saturdays) and bi-weekly [[public affairs (broadcasting)|public affairs]] programs ''Adelante, Chicago'' and ''People to People'';\n*Special live half-hour editions of WGN-TV's 9 p.m. newscast that are broadcast exclusively on CLTV during instances in which WGN-TV telecasts an [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], [[National Hockey League|NHL]] or [[Major League Baseball]] event being held on the [[Pacific Time Zone|West Coast]] that is scheduled for a 9 p.m. CT start time locally (an additional half-hour newscast airs live on WGN-TV following the game).

CLTV was also used during the existence of [[FSN Chicago|SportsChannel and Fox Sports Net Chicago]] as the overflow feeds of those channels before the launch of CSN Chicago. By the second quarter of 2010, Comcast's Chicago systems transitioned to [[digital cable|digital]]-only transmission of its channel lineup (requiring a digital converter box or [[CableCard]]-compliant receiver to receive programming), and NBCSC+ has been transitioned to its own channel, along with a NBCSC+HD feed.\n\n===Partnerships with other Tribune Company properties===\nDue to CLTV's ownership by the Tribune Company (and it's successor, Nexstar), the channel shares content and reporting from other news operations run by the company. News footage is shared extensively between CLTV and WGN-TV. All of CLTV's weather coverage is provided by WGN-TV. Columnists from the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' (as mentioned above, now separately owned since mid-2014) also provide in-depth reporting for many feature stories seen on CLTV. [[Metromix]], a joint venture between [[tronc]] and the [[Gannett|Gannett Company]] that provides local arts and cultural coverage and is available as the cultural section in the ''Tribune'', produced ''Metromix Weekend'' for CLTV.

The model name stands for [[5 ft 6 in gauge railway|broad gauge (W)]], '''A'''C Current (A), '''M'''ixed traffic (M) engine, '''4'''th generation (4). WAM4 though an indigenously produced loco was heavily inspired by French box design and naturally favoured a French TM which was the Alstom made TAO TM.A total of 500 WAM-4 were built at CLW between 1978 and 1983, which made them the most numerous class of mainline electric locomotive till its successor the [[Indian locomotive class WAG-5|WAG-5.]]\n\nThis class proved so successful by virtue of its ruggedness suitable for Indian conditions and simplicity of maintenance, that IR used this basic design for a number of other locos later ([[Indian locomotive class WCAM 1|WCAM-1]], [[Indian locomotive class WAG-5|WAG-5A]], [[Indian locomotive class WCG-2|WCG-2]], and some [[Indian locomotive class WAP-1|WAP]] models). A single WAM-4 can generally haul up to a 24-coach passenger rake. However, with the advent of new 3-phase locos like WAP - 5 and WAP - 7, the WAM - 4 locomotives were relegated to hauling smaller passenger trains. Also, due to the aging fleet the WAM - 4 locomotives are being rapidly scrapped and have been fully withdrawn from mainline duties.\n\n== Origins ==\nThe history of WAM-4 begins in early 1970s with the aim of addressing the shortcomings of the previous [[Indian locomotive class WAM-1|WAM-1]]/[[Indian locomotive class WAM-2/3|2]] and [[Indian Railways WAG class|WAG(1-4)]] classes and remove [[steam locomotive]]s from IR by a target date of 1990. The WAM1s were not great successes as some of their advanced features were unsuitable for Indian conditions\n\nso the designers at [[Research Design and Standards Organisation|RDSO]] and CLW decided to use the following\n\n* Instead of the Bo-Bo bogies of WAM-1/2, ALCO asymmetric Trimount bogies of the [[Indian locomotive class WDM-2|WDM-2]] were provided for better traction and power.\n* Silicon rectifiers with speed control by three series-parallel motor combinations and weak field operation.\n* Auxiliaries from Westinghouse and Kirloskar (compressors), S F India (blowers) and Northey (exhauster)\n* Air brakes for loco and vacuum train brakes fitted as original equipment with [[Rheostatic braking]] also provided\n* MU operation made possible up to 4 units possible.\n\nProduction of these locomotives started in 1970 with #20400 and exactly 500 WAM4s were built in 13 years with #21399 \u201cAnant\u201d being the last one. Production ended on August 3, 1983.\n\n== Variants ==\nThis loco class has been seen in many variations, as a lot of workshops and sheds have carried out their own enhancements or modifications to the basic loco design. Although the code indicates a mixed-use loco, most WAM-4's ended up hauling passenger trains.\n\nVariants include\n\n* '''WAM4B or G:''' Freight only (regeared version)\n* '''WAM4D''' or '''DB:''' Dual Braked (Air and Vacuum)\n* '''WAM4E:''' Air Brake only (for both loco and train)\n* '''WAM4H:''' Hitachi Traction Motors instead of Alstom\n* '''WAM4P:''' Passenger only (regeared version)\n* '''WAM4/2S3P:''' 2 TMs in Series, 3 in Parallel\n* '''WAM4/6P:''' 6 traction motors permanently in parallel\n* '''WAM4/6PE:''' Air braked, 6 TMs perm. in parallel\n* '''WAM4/6PDBHS:''' 6 Traction Motors permanently in parallel, Dual Brakes, High Speed\n* '''WAM-4P D:''' Passenger only (dual brakes)\n*'''WAM-4P DB 6P''' and '''WAM-4 6P D:''' These are for superfast trains\n*'''WAM-4P DB 3P and WAM-4 2S-3P:'''  some superfasts, passengers\n\nThe 'DB' or 'D' generally, but perhaps not always, indicates dual-brake capability. 'HS' may be for 'high speed'.'2S', '3P', '6P', etc. indicate traction motors connected in series or parallel. The WAM-4 has six traction motors, and originally they were wired to be available in different configurations at different power settings. At notches up to 14, all motors were in series (at notch 14 all resistors dropping out); up to notch 21 in series-parallel combinations (three pairs of motors in series, the pairs themselves being in parallel); and further notches with all motors in parallel (at notch 30 all motors are in parallel with resistors dropping out). This is the original configuration of the WCAM-x series of locos too.\n\nThe WAM-4 locos were later reconfigured to have all motors always in parallel (6P variants) or with the three series-connected pairs in parallel (2S 3P variants). Some WAM-4 locos from CLW are thought to have had the 2S 3P configuration right from the start. The 2S 3P configuration was better for the mixed traffic loads especially as it allowed the locos to start hauling larger loads without stalling. With increasing use of the WAM-4 locos for passenger traffic the all-parallel configuration was deemed more desirable since it allowed higher speeds and higher acceleration.\n\n== Livery ==\nThis loco has the widest variety of liveries, with each loco shed having its own livery\n\nMost of the WAM-4 locos now have their MU capability disabled as [[Research Design and Standards Organization|RDSO]] disapproves of these locos running MU'd over 100&nbsp;km/h.\n<ref>http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-loco2e.html</ref>\n\n== Named Locos<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/list?list_type=named&page=10|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways Locomotive Roster List|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Named Locos\n!Class\n!Loco Number\n!Name\n!Loco Shed\n!Current status\n!ref\n|-\n|WAM-4\n|20401 \n|   <abbr>BIA</abbr>  \n|Rajatabha  \n|Condemned [07/08/2007]  \n|<ref>https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/4489?list_type=named&page=10</ref>\n|-\n|WAM-4\n|20420   \n|BZA\n|Sukh Sagar Naveen \n|Scrapped\n|<ref>https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/4508?list_type=named&page=10</ref>\n|-\n|WAM-4\n|20615    \n| <abbr>ASN</abbr>  \n|Surubhi \n|Condemned in November 2011\n|<ref>https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/4703?list_type=named&page=10</ref>\n|-\n|WAM-4\n|21320 \n|<abbr>AJJ</abbr>\n|Garuda \n|Plinthed at Rail Soudha, SWR HQ, Hubli [January 2020]  \n|<ref>https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/4908?list_type=named&page=10</ref>\n|-\n|WAM-4\n|21380 \n|<abbr>ASN</abbr> \n|Navchetna  \n|In Inferior service\n|<ref>https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/4968?list_type=named&page=10</ref>\n|-\n|WAM-4\n|21399  \n| <abbr>BSL</abbr> \n|Anant \n|The last WAM-4 ever built.

The model name stands for [[5 ft 6 in gauge railway|broad gauge (W)]], '''A'''C Current (A), '''M'''ixed traffic (M) engine, '''4'''th generation (4). WAM4 though an indigenously produced loco was heavily inspired by French box design and naturally favoured a French TM which was the Alstom made TAO TM.A total of 500 WAM-4 were built at CLW between 1978 and 1983, which made them the most numerous class of mainline electric locomotive till it's successor the [[Indian locomotive class WAG-5|WAG-5.]]\n\nThis class proved so successful by virtue of its ruggedness suitable for Indian conditions and simplicity of maintenance, that IR used this basic design for a number of other locos later ([[Indian locomotive class WCAM 1|WCAM-1]], [[Indian locomotive class WAG-5|WAG-5A]], [[Indian locomotive class WCG-2|WCG-2]], and some [[Indian locomotive class WAP-1|WAP]] models). A single WAM-4 can generally haul up to a 24-coach passenger rake. However, with the advent of new 3-phase locos like WAP - 5 and WAP - 7, the WAM - 4 locomotives were relegated to hauling smaller passenger trains. Also, due to the aging fleet the WAM - 4 locomotives are being rapidly scrapped and have been fully withdrawn from mainline duties.\n\n== Origins ==\nThe history of WAM-4 begins in early 1970s with the aim of addressing the shortcomings of the previous [[Indian locomotive class WAM-1|WAM-1]]/[[Indian locomotive class WAM-2/3|2]] and [[Indian Railways WAG class|WAG(1-4)]] classes and remove [[Steam locomotive|steam locomotives]] from IR by a target date of 1990. The WAM1s were not great successes as some of their advanced features were unsuitable for Indian conditions \n\nso the designers at [[Research Design and Standards Organisation|RDSO]] and CLW decided to use the following\n\n* Instead of the Bo-Bo bogies of WAM-1/2, ALCO asymmetric Trimount bogies of the [[Indian locomotive class WDM-2|WDM-2]] were provided for better traction and power.\n* Silicon rectifiers with speed control by three series-parallel motor combinations and weak field operation.\n* Auxiliaries from Westinghouse and Kirloskar (compressors), S F India (blowers) and Northey (exhauster)\n* Air brakes for loco and vacuum train brakes fitted as original equipment with [[Rheostatic braking]] also provided\n* MU operation made possible up to 4 units possible.\n\nProduction of these locomotives started in 1970 with #20400 and exactly 500 WAM4s were built in 13 years with #21399 \u201cAnant\u201d being the last one. Production ended on August 3,1983.\n\n== Variants ==\nThis loco class has been seen in many variations, as a lot of workshops and sheds have carried out their own enhancements or modifications to the basic loco design. Although the code indicates a mixed-use loco, most WAM-4's ended up hauling passenger trains. \n\nVariants include\n\n* '''WAM4B or G:''' Freight only (regeared version)\n* '''WAM4D''' or '''DB:''' Dual Braked (Air and Vacuum)\n* '''WAM4E:''' Air Brake only (for both loco and train)\n* '''WAM4H:''' Hitachi Traction Motors instead of Alstom\n* '''WAM4P:''' Passenger only (regeared version)\n* '''WAM4/2S3P:''' 2 TMs in Series, 3 in Parallel\n* '''WAM4/6P:''' 6 traction motors permanently in parallel\n* '''WAM4/6PE:''' Air braked, 6 TMs perm. in parallel\n* '''WAM4/6PDBHS:''' 6 Traction Motors permanently in parallel, Dual Brakes, High Speed\n* '''WAM-4P D:''' Passenger only (dual brakes)\n*'''WAM-4P DB 6P''' and '''WAM-4 6P D:''' These are for superfast trains\n*'''WAM-4P DB 3P and WAM-4 2S-3P:'''  some superfasts, passengers\n\nThe 'DB' or 'D' generally, but perhaps not always, indicates dual-brake capability. 'HS' may be for 'high speed'.'2S', '3P', '6P', etc. indicate traction motors connected in series or parallel. The WAM-4 has six traction motors, and originally they were wired to be available in different configurations at different power settings. At notches up to 14, all motors were in series (at notch 14 all resistors dropping out); up to notch 21 in series-parallel combinations (three pairs of motors in series, the pairs themselves being in parallel); and further notches with all motors in parallel (at notch 30 all motors are in parallel with resistors dropping out). This is the original configuration of the WCAM-x series of locos too.\n\nThe WAM-4 locos were later reconfigured to have all motors always in parallel (6P variants) or with the three series-connected pairs in parallel (2S 3P variants). Some WAM-4 locos from CLW are thought to have had the 2S 3P configuration right from the start. The 2S 3P configuration was better for the mixed traffic loads especially as it allowed the locos to start hauling larger loads without stalling. With increasing use of the WAM-4 locos for passenger traffic the all-parallel configuration was deemed more desirable since it allowed higher speeds and higher acceleration.\n\n== Livery ==\nThis loco has the widest variety of liveries, with each loco shed having its own livery\n\nMost of the WAM-4 locos now have their MU capability disabled as [[Research Design and Standards Organization|RDSO]] disapproves of these locos running MU'd over 100&nbsp;km/h.\n<ref>http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-loco2e.html</ref>\n\n== Named Locos<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/list?list_type=named&page=10|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways Locomotive Roster List|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Named Locos\n!Class\n!Loco Number\n!Name\n!Loco Shed\n!Current status\n!ref\n|-\n|WAM-4\n|20401 \n|   <abbr>BIA</abbr>  \n|Rajatabha  \n|Condemned [07/08/2007]  \n|<ref>https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/4489?list_type=named&page=10</ref>\n|-\n|WAM-4\n|20420   \n|BZA\n|Sukh Sagar Naveen \n|Scrapped\n|<ref>https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/4508?list_type=named&page=10</ref>\n|-\n|WAM-4\n|20615    \n| <abbr>ASN</abbr>  \n|Surubhi \n|Condemned in November 2011\n|<ref>https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/4703?list_type=named&page=10</ref>\n|-\n|WAM-4\n|21320 \n|<abbr>AJJ</abbr>\n|Garuda \n|Plinthed at Rail Soudha, SWR HQ, Hubli [January 2020]  \n|<ref>https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/4908?list_type=named&page=10</ref>\n|-\n|WAM-4\n|21380 \n|<abbr>ASN</abbr> \n|Navchetna  \n|In Inferior service\n|<ref>https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/4968?list_type=named&page=10</ref>\n|-\n|WAM-4\n|21399  \n| <abbr>BSL</abbr> \n|Anant \n|The last WAM-4 ever built.

The model name stands for [[5 ft 6 in gauge railway|broad gauge (W)]], '''D'''iesel (D), '''M'''ixed traffic (M) engine, '''2'''nd generation (2). A total of 2700+ WDM-2 were built at ALCO and [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] (DLW), Varanasi between 1962 and 1998, which made them the most numerous class of mainline diesel locomotive till its successor the [[Indian locomotive class WDM-3A|WDM-3A.]]\n\nThe '''WDM-2A''' is a variant of the original WDM-2. These units have been retro-fitted with [[air brake (rail)|air brake]]s, in addition to the original [[vacuum brake]]s. The '''WDM-2B''' is a more recent locomotive, built with air brakes as original equipment. The WDM-2 locos have a maximum speed of {{convert|120|km/h|abbr=on}},<ref name = \"interactive\">{{cite web |url=http://www.irfca.org/docs/wdm2-interactive.html |title=Interactive Diagram of the WDM-2 Locomotive |author=Sheeju Chandran |date= |work= |publisher = Indian Railways Fan Club|accessdate = April 2, 2010}}</ref> restricted to {{convert|100|km/h|abbr=on}} when run long hood forward - the gear ratio is 65:18.\n\n== History ==\nThe WDM-2 history begins in the early 1960s with the stated aim of the [[Indian Railways]] to remove [[steam locomotive]]s from Indian Rails. It therefore required a large build of [[Co-Co locomotives|Co-Co]] diesel locomotives to achieve this aim. This required locomotives producing at least 2,600&nbsp;hp (1,900&nbsp;kW) and began looking at various [[Diesel-electric train|diesel-electric]] designs.\n\nInitially, the Indian railways invited tenders to build locomotives to the new specification.The following responses were received:\n\n* ALCO   submitted their model(RSD29 / DL560C) with 2600&nbsp;hp, 16-cylinder, 4-stroke     turbo-supercharged engine with Co-Co bogies.\n* [[Electro-Motive Diesel|General Motors Electro-Motive Division]] (EMD) submitted their [[EMD SD24|SD24]], given model number GT16 for the India export version. They had Co-Co bogies with 16-cylinder 2-stroke turbo-supercharged engines.\n\nEach company submitted prototypes and Indian Railways designated these prototypes as the WDM-2 class and [[Indian locomotive class WDM-4|WDM-4]] class respectively. Technologically the General Motors WDM-4 was superior to ALCO's WDM-2, but Indian Railways required a transfer of technology agreement that would allow these locomotives to be manufactured in India. General Motors did not agree to the transfer of technology agreement so the ALCo prototype was selected for production.\n\nHowever, even before the arrival of WDM-2 another type of diesel locomotive was imported from ALCo beginning in 1957. This locomotive was classified as [[Indian locomotive class WDM-1|WDM-1]].\n\n== Production History ==\nThe first few prototype WDM-2 were imported with #18040 being the first WDM-2 of India. The need for a large number of locomotives quickly was deemed paramount. After [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] (DLW) completed construction of its factory in Varanasi, production of the locomotives began in India.The first 12 locos were built using kits imported from ALCo(order no. D3389) in the United States. The first diesel loco assembled in DLW being #18233. After that DLW started manufacturing the WDM-2 locomotives from their own components. Since then over 2,800 locomotives have been manufactured and the WDM-2 has become the most popular locomotive in India with the very last one being #16887.\n\nLater a number of modifications were made and a few subclasses were created. This includes WDM-2A, WDM-2B and WDM-3A (formerly WDM-2C). Now a few WDM-2 locos are being rebuilt by Diesel Loco Modernization Works (DLMW) Patiala, Punjab. These are fitted with Daulat Ram DBR's\n\nThe WDM-2 is the diesel workhorse of the Indian Railways, being very reliable and rugged.{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Indian diesel loco WDM2.jpg\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Kundan, the first WDM-2 locomotive assembled at DLW, Varanasi.jpg\n| width2 = 150\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Left:18040 WDM-2 diesel loco at National Railway Museum, Delhi, Right:18233 WDM-2 Kundan, first diesel loco assembled at DLW,Varanasi\n}}\n\n== Some of the sheds holding WDM-2/A/B/G locomotives ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Abu Road railway station|Abu Road]] - 3\n* [[Guwahati railway station|New Guwahati]] - 4\n* [[Jamalpur railway station|Jamalpur]] - 1\n* [[Jhansi Junction railway station|Jhansi]] - 1\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed Kurla]] - 1\n* [[New Katni Jn. railway station|New Katni Jn.]] - 1 \n* [[Malda Town railway station|Malda Town]] - 8\n* [[Mughalsarai Junction railway station|Mughalsarai]] - 2\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed, Golden Rock|Golden Rock]] - 3\n* [[Raipur Junction railway station|Raipur]] - 2\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed Tondiarpet]] - 4\n''' Total Locomotioves active in service as of 01-03-2020:''' 30<br />('''Note-'''Before updating the information here anybody should check out the railways current official data first in the  '''Source''' link then change the data.)\n}}\n<br />'''Source:''' http://www.indianrailways.gov.in/railwayboard/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0,1,304,366,541,710,717\n\n== Technical specifications<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-loco2d.html|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways FAQ: Locomotives -- Specific classes : AC Electric|website=www.irfca.org}}</ref> ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Manufacturers\n|Alco, DLW\n|-\n|Engine\n|Alco 251-B, [[V16 engine|16 cylinder engine]], {{convert|2600|hp|abbr=on|lk=on}} ({{convert|2430|hp|abbr=on|disp=or}} site rating) with Alco 710/720/?? turbo supercharged engine. 1,000 rpm max, 400 rpm idle; {{convert|228|x|266|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} bore x stroke; compression ratio 12.5:1.

They had Co-Co bogies with 16-cylinder 2-stroke turbo-supercharged engines.\n\nEach company submitted prototypes and Indian Railways designated these prototypes as the WDM-2 class and [[Indian locomotive class WDM-4|WDM-4]] class respectively. Technologically the General Motors WDM-4 was superior to ALCO's WDM-2, but Indian Railways required a transfer of technology agreement that would allow these locomotives to be manufactured in India. General Motors did not agree to the transfer of technology agreement so the ALCo prototype was selected for production.\n\nHowever, even before the arrival of WDM-2 another type of diesel locomotive was imported from ALCo beginning in 1957. This locomotive was classified as [[Indian locomotive class WDM-1|WDM-1]]. \n\n== Production History ==\nThe first few prototype WDM-2 were imported with #18040 being the first WDM-2 of India. The need for a large number of locomotives quickly was deemed paramount. After [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] (DLW) completed construction of its factory in Varanasi, production of the locomotives began in India.The first 12 locos were built using kits imported from ALCo(order no. D3389) in the United States. The first diesel loco assembled in DLW being #18233. After that DLW started manufacturing the WDM-2 locomotives from their own components. Since then over 2,800 locomotives have been manufactured and the WDM-2 has become the most popular locomotive in India with the very last one being #16887.\n\nLater a number of modifications were made and a few subclasses were created. This includes WDM-2A, WDM-2B and WDM-3A (formerly WDM-2C). Now a few WDM-2 locos are being rebuilt by Diesel Loco Modernization Works (DLMW) Patiala, Punjab. These are fitted with Daulat Ram DBR's\n\nThe WDM-2 is the diesel workhorse of the Indian Railways, being very reliable and rugged.{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Indian diesel loco WDM2.jpg\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Kundan, the first WDM-2 locomotive assembled at DLW, Varanasi.jpg\n| width2 = 150\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Left:18040 WDM-2 diesel loco at National Railway Museum, Delhi, Right:18233 WDM-2 Kundan, first diesel loco assembled at DLW,Varanasi\n}}\n== Some of the sheds holding WDM-2/A/B/G locomotives ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Abu Road railway station|Abu Road]] - 3\n* [[Guwahati railway station|New Guwahati]] - 4\n* [[Jamalpur railway station|Jamalpur]] - 1\n* [[Jhansi Junction railway station|Jhansi]] - 1\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed Kurla]] - 1\n* [[New Katni Jn. railway station|New Katni Jn.]] - 1 \n* [[Malda Town railway station|Malda Town]] - 8\n* [[Mughalsarai Junction railway station|Mughalsarai]] - 2\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed, Golden Rock|Golden Rock]] - 3\n* [[Raipur Junction railway station|Raipur]] - 2\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed Tondiarpet]] - 4\n''' Total Locomotioves active in service as of 01-03-2020:''' 30<br />('''Note-'''Before updating the information here anybody should check out the railways current official data first in the  '''Source''' link then change the data.)\n}}\n<br />'''Source:''' http://www.indianrailways.gov.in/railwayboard/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0,1,304,366,541,710,717\n\n== Technical specifications<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-loco2d.html|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways FAQ: Locomotives -- Specific classes : AC Electric|website=www.irfca.org}}</ref> ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Manufacturers\n|Alco, DLW\n|-\n|Engine\n|Alco 251-B, [[V16 engine|16 cylinder engine]], {{convert|2600|hp|abbr=on|lk=on}} ({{convert|2430|hp|abbr=on|disp=or}} site rating) with Alco 710/720/?? turbo supercharged engine. 1,000 rpm max, 400 rpm idle; {{convert|228|x|266|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} bore x stroke; compression ratio 12.5:1.
