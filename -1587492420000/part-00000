After finishing 22nd in [[Football League One|League One]] during the 2006\u201307 season, [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] were relegated to [[Football League Two|League Two]] meaning the season would be their first in the bottom tier of The Football League since [[1981\u201382 Bradford City A.F.C. season|1981\u201382]]. It was also [[Stuart McCall]]'s first season as manager, after he was appointed the full-time successor to [[Colin Todd]] in May 2007. It covers a period from 1 July 2007 to 30 June 2008.\n\nMcCall brought in seven new signings in pre-season, as well as a number of loan players, but from September to November, the club failed to win in eight games, leaving them in 21st place in League Two. The club improved during the latter part of the season, finishing in 10th place, three places and 16&nbsp;points outside the [[Football League Two play-offs|play-offs]]. Bradford also suffered first round exits in two of the cup competitions they entered, and lost in the second round of the [[2007\u201308 FA Cup|FA Cup]]. [[Peter Thorne (English footballer)|Peter Thorne]] was the club's top goalscorer, recording 15&nbsp;goals, 14 in the league and one in the FA Cup. The season also marked [[centre back]] [[David Wetherall]]'s retirement after 304&nbsp;league games with the club. [[Joe Colbeck]] was named player of the season, despite spending part of the season on loan at [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]]. The club's average attendance of 13,756 was the highest in the division.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Stuart mccall.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Former City player [[Stuart McCall]] was appointed manager in pre-season, joining from [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]].]]\n{{main|2006\u201307 Bradford City A.F.C. season}}\n{{see also|History of Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City A.F.C. seasons}}\nDuring the [[2006\u201307 Bradford City A.F.C. season|2006\u201307 season]], manager [[Colin Todd]] had been sacked because of a poor run of results.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bradford_city/6354497.stm\n|title=Bradford part company with Todd\n|date=2007-02-12\n|accessdate=2008-03-21\n|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> Club captain [[David Wetherall]] was originally appointed Todd's successor on a caretaker basis, before being handed the role until the end of the season, during the following month.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bradford_city/6444657.stm\n|title=Wetherall to stay on as caretaker\n|date=2007-03-13\n|accessdate=2008-03-21\n|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> Wetherall could not stop City's run of poor form, and the club were [[promotion and relegation|relegated]] to [[Football League Two|League Two]] on 28 April 2007 after a 3\u20130 defeat at [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]].<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/6578859.stm\n|title=Chesterfield 3-0 Bradford\n|date=2007-04-28\n|accessdate=2008-03-21\n|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> It was the club's third relegation in seven seasons,<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/search/display.var.1363087.0.fans_passion_puts_players_to_shame.php\n|title=Fans' passion puts players to shame\n|date=2007-04-29\n|accessdate=2008-03-21\n|work=Telegraph & Argus\n|first=Simon\n|last=Parker}}</ref> and meant the 2007\u201308 season would be their first season in the fourth division of English football in 25&nbsp;years.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/search/display.var.1362773.0.woeful_city_relegated.php\n|title=Woeful City relegated\n|date=2007-04-28\n|accessdate=2008-03-21\n|work=Telegraph & Argus\n|first=Simon\n|last=Parker| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080405195206/http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/search/display.var.1362773.0.woeful_city_relegated.php| archivedate= 5 April 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| url-status= live}}</ref> On 22 May 2007, former City player [[Stuart McCall]], who had played more than 400&nbsp;games for the club during two previous spells,<ref name=\"markham\">{{cite book\n|last=Markham\n|first=David\n|title=The legends of Bradford City\n|publisher=Breedon Books Sport\n|year=2007\n|pages=&nbsp;114\u2013115\n|isbn=978-1-85983-572-2}}</ref> was announced as the club's new manager to take over on 1 June 2007.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bradford_city/6679253.stm\n|title=McCall named new Bradford manager\n|date=2007-05-22\n|accessdate=2008-03-21\n|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> Although the club had just 13&nbsp;players with first-team experience, the [[bookmaker]]s made City second favourites to win the League Two title.<ref name=\"bookies\">{{cite news\n|url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/search/display.var.1446155.0.bookies_tip_city_to_bounce_back.php\n|title=Bookies tip City to bounce back\n|date=2007-06-04\n|accessdate=2008-03-21\n|work=Telegraph & Argus\n|first=Dave\n|last=Craven}}</ref>\n\nDespite the club's relegation, off the field, chairman [[Julian Rhodes]] had announced a deal to slash the price of watching professional football to just [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]138, the equivalent of \u00a36 per match, and the cheapest season tickets in England.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/search/display.var.1359276.0.bradford_city_will_slash_ticket_prices.php\n|title=Bradford City WILL slash ticket prices\n|accessdate=2008-03-21\n|date=2007-04-27\n|work=Telegraph & Argus}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://flc.theoffside.com/league-two/bradford-city-set-to-offer-cheapest-season-tickets-in-the-uk.html \n |title=Bradford City Set to Offer Cheapest Season Tickets in the UK \n |accessdate=2008-03-21 \n |date=2007-05-24 \n |work=TheOffside.com \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109004807/http://flc.theoffside.com/league-two/bradford-city-set-to-offer-cheapest-season-tickets-in-the-uk.html \n |archivedate=9 January 2008 \n |df=dmy \n}}</ref> In June 2007, Rhodes was also joined by [[Mark Lawn]] as new joint chairman of the club.

A.F.C.]]'s history, their 93rd in [[The Football League]] and 95th in the [[English football league system|league system of English football]]. After finishing 22nd in [[Football League One|League One]] during the 2006\u201307 season, [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] were relegated to [[Football League Two|League Two]] meaning the season would be their first in the bottom tier of The Football League since [[1981\u201382 Bradford City A.F.C. season|1981\u201382]]. It was also [[Stuart McCall]]'s first season as manager, after he was appointed the full-time successor to [[Colin Todd]] in May 2007. It covers a period from 1 July 2007 to 30 June 2008.\n\nMcCall brought in seven new signings in pre-season, as well as a number of loan players, but from September to November, the club failed to win in eight games, leaving them in 21st place in League Two. The club improved during the latter part of the season, finishing in 10th place, three places and 16&nbsp;points outside the [[Football League Two play-offs|play-offs]]. Bradford also suffered first round exits in two of the cup competitions they entered, and lost in the second round of the [[2007\u201308 FA Cup|FA Cup]]. [[Peter Thorne (English footballer)|Peter Thorne]] was the club's top goalscorer, recording 15&nbsp;goals, 14 in the league and one in the FA Cup. The season also marked [[centre back]] [[David Wetherall]]'s retirement after 304&nbsp;league games with the club. [[Joe Colbeck]] was named player of the season, despite spending part of the season on loan at [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]]. The club's average attendance of 13,756 was the highest in the division.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Stuart mccall.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Former City player [[Stuart McCall]] was appointed manager in pre-season, joining from [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]].]]\n{{main|2006\u201307 Bradford City A.F.C. season}}\n{{see also|History of Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City A.F.C. seasons}}\nDuring the [[2006\u201307 Bradford City A.F.C. season|2006\u201307 season]], manager [[Colin Todd]] had been sacked because of a poor run of results.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bradford_city/6354497.stm\n|title=Bradford part company with Todd\n|date=2007-02-12\n|accessdate=2008-03-21\n|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> Club captain [[David Wetherall]] was originally appointed Todd's successor on a caretaker basis, before being handed the role until the end of the season, during the following month.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bradford_city/6444657.stm\n|title=Wetherall to stay on as caretaker\n|date=2007-03-13\n|accessdate=2008-03-21\n|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> Wetherall could not stop City's run of poor form, and the club were [[promotion and relegation|relegated]] to [[Football League Two|League Two]] on 28 April 2007 after a 3\u20130 defeat at [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]].<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/6578859.stm\n|title=Chesterfield 3-0 Bradford\n|date=2007-04-28\n|accessdate=2008-03-21\n|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> It was the club's third relegation in seven seasons,<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/search/display.var.1363087.0.fans_passion_puts_players_to_shame.php\n|title=Fans' passion puts players to shame\n|date=2007-04-29\n|accessdate=2008-03-21\n|work=Telegraph & Argus\n|first=Simon\n|last=Parker}}</ref> and meant the 2007\u201308 season would be their first season in the fourth division of English football in 25&nbsp;years.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/search/display.var.1362773.0.woeful_city_relegated.php\n|title=Woeful City relegated\n|date=2007-04-28\n|accessdate=2008-03-21\n|work=Telegraph & Argus\n|first=Simon\n|last=Parker| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080405195206/http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/search/display.var.1362773.0.woeful_city_relegated.php| archivedate= 5 April 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| url-status= live}}</ref> On 22 May 2007, former City player [[Stuart McCall]], who had played more than 400&nbsp;games for the club during two previous spells,<ref name=\"markham\">{{cite book\n|last=Markham\n|first=David\n|title=The legends of Bradford City\n|publisher=Breedon Books Sport\n|year=2007\n|pages=&nbsp;114\u2013115\n|isbn=978-1-85983-572-2}}</ref> was announced as the club's new manager to take over on 1 June 2007.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bradford_city/6679253.stm\n|title=McCall named new Bradford manager\n|date=2007-05-22\n|accessdate=2008-03-21\n|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> Although the club had just 13&nbsp;players with first-team experience, the [[bookmaker]]s made City second favourites to win the League Two title.<ref name=\"bookies\">{{cite news\n|url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/search/display.var.1446155.0.bookies_tip_city_to_bounce_back.php\n|title=Bookies tip City to bounce back\n|date=2007-06-04\n|accessdate=2008-03-21\n|work=Telegraph & Argus\n|first=Dave\n|last=Craven}}</ref>\n\nDespite the club's relegation, off the field, chairman [[Julian Rhodes]] had announced a deal to slash the price of watching professional football to just [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]138, the equivalent of \u00a36 per match, and the cheapest season tickets in England.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/search/display.var.1359276.0.bradford_city_will_slash_ticket_prices.php\n|title=Bradford City WILL slash ticket prices\n|accessdate=2008-03-21\n|date=2007-04-27\n|work=Telegraph & Argus}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://flc.theoffside.com/league-two/bradford-city-set-to-offer-cheapest-season-tickets-in-the-uk.html \n |title=Bradford City Set to Offer Cheapest Season Tickets in the UK \n |accessdate=2008-03-21 \n |date=2007-05-24 \n |work=TheOffside.com \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109004807/http://flc.theoffside.com/league-two/bradford-city-set-to-offer-cheapest-season-tickets-in-the-uk.html \n |archivedate=9 January 2008 \n |df=dmy \n}}</ref> In June 2007, Rhodes was also joined by [[Mark Lawn]] as new joint chairman of the club.

New staircases and elevators descend to the platforms from the central station building. A former public restroom now being used as a community center in the median of Broadway north of 96th Street is sometimes mistaken for a former subway station headhouse; however, this structure was built decades after the subway station and conforms to the design of other public restroom buildings in New York City<ref>[http://forgotten-ny.com/2008/10/forgotten-radio-city/02-bathroom/ Forgotten NY] New York's Beaux-Arts Bathrooms</ref> rather than to the design of IRT subway headhouses such as [[72nd Street (IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line)|72nd Street]].\n\nThe station's configuration, with both island and side platforms, is unusual in the New York City Subway. As originally intended, the island platforms facilitated an easy transfer between local and express trains, while the shorter side platforms provided easy access from local trains to the street. This design was also utilized at [[Brooklyn Bridge\u2013City Hall (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|Brooklyn Bridge\u2013City Hall]] and [[14th Street\u2013Union Square (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|14th Street\u2013Union Square]] on the [[IRT Lexington Avenue Line]]. When the subway first opened, it was possible to open both sides of the train at once. As this is not practical on more modern trains, only the doors facing the island platforms are used (to permit transfers between local and express trains), and the side platforms were abandoned.\n\nThe unused side platforms and former entrance/exits have been turned into storage space and offices. Switching system panels can be seen through new windows on the now walled off western side platform.\n\n=== Exits ===\n[[File:96th Street - Stationhouse.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Completed new headhouse]]\nAs 96th Street is a major transfer point, there are two sets of entrances and exits at the station.<ref>{{cite web|title=MTA Neighborhood Maps: Upper West Side and Central park|url=http://web.mta.info/maps/neighborhoods/mn/M15_upper_west_side_cp_2015.pdf|website=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|mta.info]]|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|accessdate=September 30, 2015|date=2015}}</ref> For the purposes of this article, entrance and exit are interchangeable.

There are two [[island platform]]s that allow for [[cross-platform interchange]]s between local (outer tracks) and express (inner tracks) trains heading in the same direction, in this case uptown or downtown. During normal service, southbound local trains use track B1 and southbound express trains use track B2. Northbound express trains use track B3 and northbound local trains use track B4. These track designations are not posted in the station, but are used in the [[New York City Subway chaining|chaining]] of each individual track, used to measure distance by train crews on the subway.<ref name=\"tracks\">{{NYCS const|trackref|trackbook3}}</ref><ref name=\"chaining\">[http://thejoekorner.quuxuum.org/chainall.htm New York City Subway chaining] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405113145/http://thejoekorner.quuxuum.org/chainall.htm |date=April 5, 2008 }} ''TheJoeKorner'' Retrieved September 1, 2008</ref>\n\nNorth of 96th Street, the express tracks descend and turn east under West 104th Street and running northeast under [[Central Park]] on their way to the [[IRT Lenox Avenue Line]] at West 110th Street. The local tracks remain on the upper level to [[Riverdale, Bronx]]. After the express tracks diverge, a currently unused center track starts at approximately 100th Street. Some last minute design changes added the third track northbound, and a provision for a third track was also built into the lower level Lenox branch of the junction. This accounts for the extra space seen alongside the active tracks in this area.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe station was extended and widened in 1950 to accommodate longer trains. The extent of the original station is clearly visible, as the renovation was not done in the same style. Differences in the walls and ceiling are visible at the south end. The creation of a new entrance at 94th Street led to the closure of the [[91st Street (IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line)|91st Street]] station, as it would have been pointless to lengthen it for 10-car local trains with an adjacent station only a few blocks away.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/08/arts/my-manhattan-next-stop-subway-s-past.html|title=My Manhattan; Next Stop: Subway's Past|last=Aciman|first=Andre|date=January 8, 1999|work=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=August 26, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=February 2009|title=High-Speed Broadway Local Service Began in 1959|url=https://issuu.com/erausa/docs/2009-02-bulletin/1|journal=The Bulletin|publisher=New York Division, Electric Railroaders' Association|volume=52|issue=2|doi=|pmid=|access-date=August 26, 2016|via=Issu}}</ref>\n\n=== Unused side platforms ===\n[[File:96th Street IRT Broadway 001.JPG|thumb|left|175px|Original cartouche on the wall with the number \"96\"]]\n[[File:96th Street IRT Broadway 2.JPG|thumb|left|175px|Modern wall mosaics]]\n\nAccess to the station was originally from stairways along the sidewalks of Broadway, to the extreme north end of the [[side platform]]s, then to the center island platforms via an underpass.<ref name=\"nycs\">[http://nycsubway.org/perl/stations?6:3140 96th Street] ''NYCSubway'' Retrieved September 1, 2008</ref> As of April 5, 2010, a new [[headhouse]] in Broadway's center median between 96th and 95th Streets rendered those entrances obsolete. New staircases and elevators descend to the platforms from the central station building. A former public restroom now being used as a community center in the median of Broadway north of 96th Street is sometimes mistaken for a former subway station headhouse; however, this structure was built decades after the subway station and conforms to the design of other public restroom buildings in New York City<ref>[http://forgotten-ny.com/2008/10/forgotten-radio-city/02-bathroom/ Forgotten NY] New York's Beaux-Arts Bathrooms</ref> rather than to the design of IRT subway headhouses such as [[72nd Street (IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line)|72nd Street]].\n\nThe station's configuration, with both island and side platforms, is unusual in the New York City Subway. As originally intended, the island platforms facilitated an easy transfer between local and express trains, while the shorter side platforms provided easy access from local trains to the street. This design was also utilized at [[Brooklyn Bridge\u2013City Hall (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|Brooklyn Bridge\u2013City Hall]] and [[14th Street\u2013Union Square (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|14th Street\u2013Union Square]] on the [[IRT Lexington Avenue Line]]. When the subway first opened, it was possible to open both sides of the train at once. As this is not practical on more modern trains, only the doors facing the island platforms are used (to permit transfers between local and express trains), and the side platforms were abandoned.\n\nThe unused side platforms and former entrance/exits have been turned into storage space and offices. Switching system panels can be seen through new windows on the now walled off western side platform.\n\n=== Exits ===\n[[File:96th Street - Stationhouse.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Completed new headhouse]]\nAs 96th Street is a major transfer point, there are two sets of entrances and exits at the station.<ref>{{cite web|title=MTA Neighborhood Maps: Upper West Side and Central park|url=http://web.mta.info/maps/neighborhoods/mn/M15_upper_west_side_cp_2015.pdf|website=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|mta.info]]|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|accessdate=September 30, 2015|date=2015}}</ref> For the purposes of this article, entrance and exit are interchangeable.
