Land can further be reclaimed from the sea for more runways and terminal buildings.\n\nThe master plan initially involved a dual-terminal and dual-runway configuration over two phases with provisions for another two passenger terminals. Phase 1 included the construction for terminal 1, the first runway, 45 aircraft parking bays, support facilities and structures, including a large maintenance hangar, the first fire station, workshops and administrative offices, an airfreight complex, two cargo agents' buildings, in-flight catering kitchens and a {{cvt|80|m}} control tower. Phase II construction commenced immediately after the completion of Phase 1 and include the second runway, 23 additional aircraft parking bays, a second fire station, and a third cargo agents' building.\n\n==Changi Airport Control Tower==\n[[File:Singapore Changi Airport, Control Tower 2, Dec 05.JPG|thumb|left|Changi Control Tower.]]\nThe Air traffic control tower (ATC) was constructed in Phase One, sited in between the first 2 runways and stands at about 81 m Above Mean Sea Level (AMSL). It provides aerodrome control service to aircraft landing, departing and maneuvering within the airport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caas.gov.sg/caas/en/About_CAAS/Our_Strategic_Thrusts/Air_Navigation_Services/Our_Facilities/Changi_Control_Tower.html|title= Singapore Changi Control Tower|publisher=Civil Aviation Authority Singapore (CAAS)|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170430223415/https://www.caas.gov.sg/caas/en/About_CAAS/Our_Strategic_Thrusts/Air_Navigation_Services/Our_Facilities/Changi_Control_Tower.html|archivedate=30 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Runways==\nChangi Airport has two parallel runways of size {{cvt|4000|by|60|m|0}} each, designated 02L/20R and 02C/20C.<ref name=\"AIP\"/> 02L/20R was completed in 1981 with a [[displaced threshold]] of {{cvt|740|m|0}} leaving the rest of the runway at {{cvt|3260|m|0}} long.<ref name=\"AIP\"/> 02C/20C (formerly named 02R/20L) was built completely on [[Land reclamation|reclaimed land]] and opened with phase&nbsp;2, {{cvt|1.6|km}} to the east of 02L/20R.

The [[Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore]] spent [[Singapore dollar|S$]]60 million in upgrading the two existing terminals and airport infrastructure, including enlarged gate hold rooms, new finger piers, and extended baggage belt carousels from the normal {{cvt|70|to|90|m}}. With these new carousels in place, the airport does not expect embarking and disembarking passengers and baggage from the A380 to take longer than it does from a Boeing 747-400, which carries fewer passengers. On 16 August 2005, Changi Airport unveiled the first of 11 specially built gates capable of handling the giant aircraft. Costing S$15 million, the gates or 'fingers' enable passengers to board the upper deck of the new 555-seater aircraft directly from the gate hold rooms. The hold rooms themselves have been enlarged and appointed to cater to the larger number of passengers aboard an A380. Beside the 11 new A380-capable gates at Terminals 1 and 2, eight more A380-capable gates were opened at Terminal 3 on 9 January 2008.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://appserver1.caas.gov.sg/caasmediaweb2010/opencms/Journalist/Press_Releases/2005/news_0010.html?__locale=en&site=caas | archive-url=https://archive.is/20121224191005/http://appserver1.caas.gov.sg/caasmediaweb2010/opencms/Journalist/Press_Releases/2005/news_0010.html?__locale=en&site=caas | url-status=dead | archive-date=24 December 2012 | title=First Gate at Singapore Changi Airport is Ready for Airbus 380 | publisher=Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) | date=16 August 2005 | accessdate=31 October 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Jewel Changi Airport==\n{{main|Jewel Changi Airport}}\n[[File:Jewel Changi Airport Rain Vortex 4.jpg|left|thumb|Jewel Changi]]\nAnnounced in August 2013, Jewel is a new terminal structure that is intended as a mixed-use complex.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.changiairport.com/corporate/media-centre/newsroom.html#/pressreleases/changi-airport-group-and-capitamalls-asia-to-jointly-develop-project-jewel-at-changi-airport-943581 | title=Changi Airport Group to develop iconic mixed-use complex | publisher=Changi Airport Group | date=19 August 2013| accessdate=19 August 2013}}</ref> It is situated on a 3.5-hectare site where the Terminal 1 car park used to reside.

Configured in an H-shaped layout to maximise the number of aerobridges that may be built, it underwent two major upgrading works over its lifespan. A major refurbishment was completed in 1995 at a cost of S$170 million and work to extend two finger piers to add 14 aerobridges at a cost of S$420 million that took place from 1996 to 1999. Today, the terminal spans an area of 308,000 m\u00b2 and can accommodate a maximum passenger capacity of 21 million passengers a year.\n\nOn 7 March 2012, Minister of State for Transport [[Josephine Teo]] said that the open-air car park between Terminal&nbsp;1 and Changi's iconic control tower will be redeveloped into a multi-use complex. This new complex will be integrated with the existing building, and will increase Terminal&nbsp;1's public areas, pick-up driveways, and car park spaces.

This is due to the ongoing [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore|COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Toh |first1=Ting Wei |title=Parliament: Changi Airport T2 operations to be suspended for 18 months amid coronavirus outbreak |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/operations-at-changi-airport-t2-to-be-suspended-for-18-months-amid-coronavirus-outbreak |website=The Straits Times |accessdate=6 April 2020 |date=6 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Former Budget Terminal ===\nChangi Airport was the second in Asia (after [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport]]) to open a dedicated terminal catering to the budget traveller. The name of the Budget Terminal was decided as a result of a naming contest open to the public. However, the terminal is not included in the numbering scheme, even though it is the third passenger terminal to be opened when it opened on 26 March 2006; and Terminal 3 is actually the fifth terminal to be opened at the airport (with the fourth being the cargo terminal).\n\nTo offer lower [[landing fee]]s, handling fees and [[Airport Improvement Fee|airport taxes]], it cuts back on amenities such as aerobridges, elaborate physical structures and decorations in the passenger terminal building. There is no transfer facility at the Budget Terminal.\n\nIn September 2008, expansion works costing $10&nbsp;million began and took seven months to complete. The terminal was then able to handle seven million passengers a year, up from originally 2.7&nbsp;million. There are more boarding gates, check-in counters, shops, and dining options. In addition, air-conditioning has been installed for arriving passengers.\n\nOn 2 March 2012, it was announced that the Budget Terminal would be closed on 25 September 2012 and demolished to make way for Terminal 4. All airlines previously operating from the Budget Terminal moved to Terminal 2, after the last flight departed Budget Terminal at 2&nbsp;am on 25 September. Construction of Terminal 4 began in 2013 and was completed on 31 October 2017. It will have a capacity for 16 million passengers per annum, up from the previous 7 million of the Budget Terminal, and will have aerobridges. It also promises to have a wider choice of retail and food and beverage offerings compared to the current Budget Terminal. Terminal 4 will be designed to enable efficient passenger processing and quick turnaround of aircraft. That is because once the ASEAN Open Skies agreement is in place by 2011, passenger traffic will likely grow by at least five percent each year.\n\n=== JetQuay CIP Terminal ===\nJetQuay CIP Terminal, is a privately run terminal, located in between T2 and the VIP terminal. JetQuay provides private check-in, baggage handling, and immigration clearance services. It is the second luxury airport terminal in world to open after the Lufthansa First Class Terminal in [[Frankfurt Airport]]. However, unlike the Lufthansa First Class Terminal, JetQuay is an elite, dedicated CIP (Commercially Important People) terminal that can be used by any passenger travelling in any class, on any airline, through any terminal (T1, T2, T3, or T4).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n=== Terminal 3 ===\n[[File:SINT3.JPG|thumb|left|Transit area of Terminal 3.]]\n[[File:Changi Airport Terminal 3 butterfly garden.JPG|thumb|The Butterfly Garden in Terminal 3.]]\n[[File:T3TransitArea.JPG|thumb|Shops line along the transit area in Terminal 3.]]\nTerminal 3, the airport's fourth passenger terminal, became operational on 9 January 2008,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dfnionline.com/article/Changi-T3-opens-for-business-1851956.html |title=Singapore Changi Terminal&nbsp;3 Opens |publisher=Dfnionline.com |accessdate=8 November 2011}}</ref> increasing the airport's annual passenger capacity by 22&nbsp;million.

Like other new airports in the region, it has a structure mainly made of glass, with big transparent spaces inside the terminal. However, unlike these newer airports, it incorporates \"natural\" features and \"warm\" tone extensively to balance the sterile feel of glass and steel. For example, the column is given a wood-like cladding and the floor of the terminal is mostly cream/ beige colour. The roof has been designed to allow natural light to enter the building, with 919 [[Window#Skylight|skylights]]. A {{cvt|5|m}}-high \"Green Wall\" with hanging creepers and waterfall was incorporated to enhance the tropical feel. The Green Wall, designed by Singapore-based Landscape Design firm Tierra Design, also helps to regulate the internal temperature of the terminal with the occasional misting.

The Qantas Singapore Lounge draws on Qantas' flagship lounges in Sydney and Melbourne including a live cooking station and communal dining areas designed by [[Hurley Palmer Flatt]].\n\nPassengers at Changi Airport will soon be able to board their flights faster, with the introduction of self-boarding gates. The Changi Airport Group (CAG) has been conducting trials of the self-boarding gates at a common gate hold room in Terminal 2 since May with [[Lufthansa]]. The self-boarding gates are just one component of a fast and seamless travel (FAST) initiative which CAG will be rolling out across terminals at the airport. Since April 2014, the gates have been progressively introduced in common gate hold rooms in all three terminals. {{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nThe ongoing trial of a number of self-service functions \u2013 check-in, bag tagging, and bag drop \u2013 will run for about three months until August 2014. It will enable CAG to assess improvements and adjustments needed for the hardware and software of the various systems.\n\nTwo self bag-drop units and four self-check-in kiosks have been fitted alongside the [[Jetstar]] check-in counters in Terminal 1. Passengers on selected [[Jetstar]] flights are invited to use these self-service options. At the self-check-in kiosk, passengers print their boarding pass as well as baggage tag after checking in. After tagging their baggage, they can drop it off at the self bag-drop counter. A receipt is provided for checked-in baggage. Instructional videos and signs are available to guide passengers, and on-ground staff is also present to provide assistance. Since the trial started in early May, about 1,000 passengers have used the FAST facilities. {{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Aviation services===\n\n====Ground handling====\n[[File:Singapore changi airport ground handling emirates.JPG|thumb|An [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]] [[Boeing 777-300]] and [[Cathay Pacific]] [[Boeing 747-400]] being serviced at Terminal 1]]\n\nGround handling services are handled by two companies: [[Singapore Airport Terminal Services]] (SATS) and [[Dnata]]. SATS is the dominant player with close to 70% of the market in the airport. [[Dnata Singapore]], formerly Changi International Airport Services (CIAS), was formed in 1977 by the [[PSA International|Port of Singapore Authority]] and five airlines ([[Air France]], [[China Airlines]], [[Garuda Indonesia]], [[Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij N.V.]] (KLM; Royal Dutch Airlines) and [[Lufthansa]]). It handles the remaining market share.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the government decided to introduce competition into the market by offering an additional licence. [[Swissair]]'s [[Swissport]] won the 10-year licence and commenced operations on 2 March 2005.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.swissport.com/mediacenter/index_news.php?id=206&ref=archive| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090415005215/http://www.swissport.com/mediacenter/index_news.php?id=206&ref=archive| archivedate= 15 April 2009| title= Swissport handles its first flight in Singapore \u2013 four months earlier than planned| accessdate=20 January 2008| date= 2 March 2005| work= News Releases| publisher= Swissport International| quote= 2 March 2005 \u2013 Swissport commenced its operations at Singapore's Changi Airport today, becoming the airport's third ground handling provider; Swissport's new licence at Changi is valid for ten years and covers passenger, baggage and cargo handling services.}}</ref>\n\nAs Swissair folded and was subsequently taken over by [[Swiss International Air Lines]], the latter became the company's first customer. [[Adam Air]] chose Swissport as its ground handler in 2005, while Tiger Airways followed suit in 2006. Other customers of Swissport include [[Swiss World Cargo]], [[AirAsia]], and [[Cardig Air]]. Former customers of Swissport include [[Australian Airlines]]. Swissport ceased operation on 31 March 2009 due to massive losses.\n\nIn 2009, a wholly owned subsidiary of SATS, Asia Pacific Star (APS) began operating.<ref>{{cite web|title=SATS LAUNCHES LOW-COST GROUND HANDLING UNIT|url=https://www.sats.com.sg/Media/NewsContent/PR-10_Mar09.pdf|website=www.sats.com.sg|accessdate=10 March 2009}}</ref> It concentrates mainly on budget carriers by providing point-to-point ground handling services such as passenger, ramp and baggage handling, and aircraft interior cleaning with short turnaround times.

As the country's primary international airport, it was designed for current needs and future expansion to double its passenger's handling. Land can further be reclaimed from the sea for more runways and terminal buildings.\n\nThe master plan initially involved a dual-terminal and dual-runway configuration over two phases with provisions for another two passenger terminals. Phase 1 included the construction for terminal 1, the first runway, 45 aircraft parking bays, support facilities and structures, including a large maintenance hangar, the first fire station, workshops and administrative offices, an airfreight complex, two cargo agents' buildings, in-flight catering kitchens and a {{cvt|80|m}} control tower. Phase II construction commenced immediately after the completion of Phase 1 and include the second runway, 23 additional aircraft parking bays, a second fire station, and a third cargo agents' building.\n\n==Changi Airport Control Tower==\n[[File:Singapore Changi Airport, Control Tower 2, Dec 05.JPG|thumb|left|Changi Control Tower.]]\nThe Air traffic control tower (ATC) was constructed in Phase One, sited in between the first 2 runways and stands at about 81 m Above Mean Sea Level (AMSL). It provides aerodrome control service to aircraft landing, departing and maneuvering within the airport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caas.gov.sg/caas/en/About_CAAS/Our_Strategic_Thrusts/Air_Navigation_Services/Our_Facilities/Changi_Control_Tower.html|title= Singapore Changi Control Tower|publisher=Civil Aviation Authority Singapore (CAAS)|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170430223415/https://www.caas.gov.sg/caas/en/About_CAAS/Our_Strategic_Thrusts/Air_Navigation_Services/Our_Facilities/Changi_Control_Tower.html|archivedate=30 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Runways==\nChangi Airport has two parallel runways of size {{cvt|4000|by|60|m|0}} each, designated 02L/20R and 02C/20C.<ref name=\"AIP\"/> 02L/20R was completed in 1981 with a [[displaced threshold]] of {{cvt|740|m|0}} leaving the rest of the runway at {{cvt|3260|m|0}} long.<ref name=\"AIP\"/> 02C/20C (formerly named 02R/20L) was built completely on [[Land reclamation|reclaimed land]] and opened with phase&nbsp;2, {{cvt|1.6|km}} to the east of 02L/20R.

The [[Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore]] spent [[Singapore dollar|S$]]60 million in upgrading the two existing terminals and airport infrastructure, including enlarged gate hold rooms, new finger piers, and extended baggage belt carousels from the normal {{cvt|70|to|90|m}}. With these new carousels in place, the airport does not expect embarking and disembarking passengers and baggage from the A380 to take longer than it does from a Boeing 747-400, which carries fewer passengers. On 16 August 2005, Changi Airport unveiled the first of 11 specially built gates capable of handling the giant aircraft. Costing S$15 million, the gates or 'fingers' enable passengers to board the upper deck of the new 555-seater aircraft directly from the gate hold rooms. The hold rooms themselves have been enlarged and appointed to cater to the larger number of passengers aboard an A380. Beside the 11 new A380-capable gates at Terminals 1 and 2, eight more A380-capable gates were opened at Terminal 3 on 9 January 2008.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://appserver1.caas.gov.sg/caasmediaweb2010/opencms/Journalist/Press_Releases/2005/news_0010.html?__locale=en&site=caas | archive-url=https://archive.is/20121224191005/http://appserver1.caas.gov.sg/caasmediaweb2010/opencms/Journalist/Press_Releases/2005/news_0010.html?__locale=en&site=caas | url-status=dead | archive-date=24 December 2012 | title=First Gate at Singapore Changi Airport is Ready for Airbus 380 | publisher=Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) | date=16 August 2005 | accessdate=31 October 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Jewel Changi Airport==\n{{main|Jewel Changi Airport}}\n[[File:Jewel Changi Airport Rain Vortex 4.jpg|left|thumb|Jewel Changi]]\nAnnounced in August 2013, Jewel is a new terminal structure that is intended as a mixed-use complex.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.changiairport.com/corporate/media-centre/newsroom.html#/pressreleases/changi-airport-group-and-capitamalls-asia-to-jointly-develop-project-jewel-at-changi-airport-943581 | title=Changi Airport Group to develop iconic mixed-use complex | publisher=Changi Airport Group | date=19 August 2013| accessdate=19 August 2013}}</ref> It is situated on a 3.5-hectare site where the Terminal 1 car park used to reside.

Configured in an H-shaped layout to maximise the number of aerobridges that may be built, it underwent two major upgrading works over its lifespan. A major refurbishment was completed in 1995 at a cost of S$170 million and work to extend two finger piers to add 14 aerobridges at a cost of S$420 million that took place from 1996 to 1999. Today, the terminal spans an area of 308,000 m\u00b2 and can accommodate a maximum passenger capacity of 21 million passengers a year.\n\nOn 7 March 2012, Minister of State for Transport [[Josephine Teo]] said that the open-air car park between Terminal&nbsp;1 and Changi's iconic control tower will be redeveloped into a multi-use complex. This new complex will be integrated with the existing building, and will increase Terminal&nbsp;1's public areas, pick-up driveways, and car park spaces. With this expansion, Terminal&nbsp;1's handling capacity will increase from 21 to 24&nbsp;million passengers per annum.

This is due to the ongoing [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore|COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Toh |first1=Ting Wei |title=Parliament: Changi Airport T2 operations to be suspended for 18 months amid coronavirus outbreak |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/operations-at-changi-airport-t2-to-be-suspended-for-18-months-amid-coronavirus-outbreak |website=The Straits Times |accessdate=6 April 2020 |date=6 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Former Budget Terminal ===\nChangi Airport was the second in Asia (after [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport]]) to open a dedicated terminal catering to the budget traveller. The name of the Budget Terminal was decided as a result of a naming contest open to the public. However, the terminal is not included in the numbering scheme, even though it is the third passenger terminal to be opened when it opened on 26 March 2006; and Terminal 3 is actually the fifth terminal to be opened at the airport (with the fourth being the cargo terminal).\n\nTo offer lower [[landing fee]]s, handling fees and [[Airport Improvement Fee|airport taxes]], it cuts back on amenities such as aerobridges, elaborate physical structures and decorations in the passenger terminal building. There is no transfer facility at the Budget Terminal.\n\nIn September 2008, expansion works costing $10&nbsp;million began and took seven months to complete. The terminal was then able to handle seven million passengers a year, up from originally 2.7&nbsp;million. There are more boarding gates, check-in counters, shops, and dining options. In addition, air-conditioning has been installed for arriving passengers.\n\nOn 2 March 2012, it was announced that the Budget Terminal would be closed on 25 September 2012 and demolished to make way for Terminal 4. All airlines previously operating from the Budget Terminal moved to Terminal 2, after the last flight departed Budget Terminal at 2&nbsp;am on 25 September. Construction of Terminal 4 began in 2013 and was completed on 31 October 2017. It will have a capacity for 16 million passengers per annum, up from the previous 7 million of the Budget Terminal, and will have aerobridges. It also promises to have a wider choice of retail and food and beverage offerings compared to the current Budget Terminal. Terminal 4 will be designed to enable efficient passenger processing and quick turnaround of aircraft. That is because once the ASEAN Open Skies agreement is in place by 2011, passenger traffic will likely grow by at least five percent each year.\n\n=== JetQuay CIP Terminal ===\nJetQuay CIP Terminal, is a privately run terminal, located in between T2 and the VIP terminal. JetQuay provides private check-in, baggage handling, and immigration clearance services. It is the second luxury airport terminal in world to open after the Lufthansa First Class Terminal in [[Frankfurt Airport]]. However, unlike the Lufthansa First Class Terminal, JetQuay is an elite, dedicated CIP (Commercially Important People) terminal that can be used by any passenger travelling in any class, on any airline, through any terminal (T1, T2, T3, or T4).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n=== Terminal 3 ===\n[[File:SINT3.JPG|thumb|left|Transit area of Terminal 3.]]\n[[File:Changi Airport Terminal 3 butterfly garden.JPG|thumb|The Butterfly Garden in Terminal 3.]]\n[[File:T3TransitArea.JPG|thumb|Shops line along the transit area in Terminal 3.]]\nTerminal 3, the airport's fourth passenger terminal, became operational on 9 January 2008,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dfnionline.com/article/Changi-T3-opens-for-business-1851956.html |title=Singapore Changi Terminal&nbsp;3 Opens |publisher=Dfnionline.com |accessdate=8 November 2011}}</ref> increasing the airport's annual passenger capacity by 22&nbsp;million.

Like other new airports in the region, it has a structure mainly made of glass, with big transparent spaces inside the terminal. However, unlike these newer airports, it incorporates \"natural\" features and \"warm\" tone extensively to balance the sterile feel of glass and steel. For example, the column is given a wood-like cladding and the floor of the terminal is mostly cream/ beige colour. The roof has been designed to allow natural light to enter the building, with 919 [[Window#Skylight|skylights]]. A {{cvt|5|m}}-high \"Green Wall\" with hanging creepers and waterfall was incorporated to enhance the tropical feel. The Green Wall, designed by Singapore-based Landscape Design firm Tierra Design, also helps to regulate the internal temperature of the terminal with the occasional misting.

The Qantas Singapore Lounge draws on Qantas' flagship lounges in Sydney and Melbourne including a live cooking station and communal dining areas designed by [[Hurley Palmer Flatt]].\n\nPassengers at Changi Airport will soon be able to board their flights faster, with the introduction of self-boarding gates. The Changi Airport Group (CAG) has been conducting trials of the self-boarding gates at a common gate hold room in Terminal 2 since May with [[Lufthansa]]. The self-boarding gates are just one component of a fast and seamless travel (FAST) initiative which CAG will be rolling out across terminals at the airport. Since April 2014, the gates have been progressively introduced in common gate hold rooms in all three terminals. {{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nThe ongoing trial of a number of self-service functions \u2013 check-in, bag tagging, and bag drop \u2013 will run for about three months until August 2014. It will enable CAG to assess improvements and adjustments needed for the hardware and software of the various systems.\n\nTwo self bag-drop units and four self-check-in kiosks have been fitted alongside the [[Jetstar]] check-in counters in Terminal 1. Passengers on selected [[Jetstar]] flights are invited to use these self-service options. At the self-check-in kiosk, passengers print their boarding pass as well as baggage tag after checking in. After tagging their baggage, they can drop it off at the self bag-drop counter. A receipt is provided for checked-in baggage. Instructional videos and signs are available to guide passengers, and on-ground staff is also present to provide assistance. Since the trial started in early May, about 1,000 passengers have used the FAST facilities. {{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Aviation services===\n\n====Ground handling====\n[[File:Singapore changi airport ground handling emirates.JPG|thumb|An [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]] [[Boeing 777-300]] and [[Cathay Pacific]] [[Boeing 747-400]] being serviced at Terminal 1]]\n\nGround handling services are handled by two companies: [[Singapore Airport Terminal Services]] (SATS) and [[Dnata]]. SATS is the dominant player with close to 70% of the market in the airport. [[Dnata Singapore]], formerly Changi International Airport Services (CIAS), was formed in 1977 by the [[PSA International|Port of Singapore Authority]] and five airlines ([[Air France]], [[China Airlines]], [[Garuda Indonesia]], [[Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij N.V.]] (KLM; Royal Dutch Airlines) and [[Lufthansa]]). It handles the remaining market share.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the government decided to introduce competition into the market by offering an additional licence. [[Swissair]]'s [[Swissport]] won the 10-year licence and commenced operations on 2 March 2005.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.swissport.com/mediacenter/index_news.php?id=206&ref=archive| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090415005215/http://www.swissport.com/mediacenter/index_news.php?id=206&ref=archive| archivedate= 15 April 2009| title= Swissport handles its first flight in Singapore \u2013 four months earlier than planned| accessdate=20 January 2008| date= 2 March 2005| work= News Releases| publisher= Swissport International| quote= 2 March 2005 \u2013 Swissport commenced its operations at Singapore's Changi Airport today, becoming the airport's third ground handling provider; Swissport's new licence at Changi is valid for ten years and covers passenger, baggage and cargo handling services.}}</ref>\n\nAs Swissair folded and was subsequently taken over by [[Swiss International Air Lines]], the latter became the company's first customer. [[Adam Air]] chose Swissport as its ground handler in 2005, while Tiger Airways followed suit in 2006. Other customers of Swissport include [[Swiss World Cargo]], [[AirAsia]], and [[Cardig Air]]. Former customers of Swissport include [[Australian Airlines]]. Swissport ceased operation on 31 March 2009 due to massive losses.\n\nIn 2009, a wholly owned subsidiary of SATS, Asia Pacific Star (APS) began operating.<ref>{{cite web|title=SATS LAUNCHES LOW-COST GROUND HANDLING UNIT|url=https://www.sats.com.sg/Media/NewsContent/PR-10_Mar09.pdf|website=www.sats.com.sg|accessdate=10 March 2009}}</ref> It concentrates mainly on budget carriers by providing point-to-point ground handling services such as passenger, ramp and baggage handling, and aircraft interior cleaning with short turnaround times. Some of the airlines APS handles include the [[AirAsia]] Group, [[Cebu Pacific]] and [[Spring Airlines]].\n\nCIAS underwent restructuring when its shareholding was bought over by [[Dubai]]'s [[Dnata]] in 2004, being relaunched in August 2011 with a new branding.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.theemiratesgroup.com/english/our-brands/airport-aviation-handling/dnata-singapore.aspx | title=Our Brands | work=The Emirates Group | accessdate=21 August 2013}}</ref> Its security services were amalgamated into the new Temasek-owned [[Aetos Security Management]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.temasek.com.sg/mediacentre/newsreleases?detailid=8530 | title=Formation of AETOS Security Management Pte Ltd | publisher=Temasek Holdings | date=31 March 2004| accessdate=21 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Aircraft maintenance====\nSix aircraft hangars, capable of full aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul is operated and managed by [[SIA Engineering Company]] at Changi Airfreight Centre and five aircraft hangars by SASCO/[[ST Aerospace]].

Three models are being produced: the base '''SC-44''' locomotive designed to haul traditional passenger cars in [[inter-city rail]] service, the '''SCB-40''' locomotive designed to pair with the [[Siemens Viaggio Comfort]] passenger car trainset in [[inter-city rail]] service, and the '''ALC-42''' locomotive designed to haul traditional passenger cars in [[long distance rail]] service.\n\nThe first production SC-44 unit was unveiled on March 26, 2016. The first SC-44 unit went into Amtrak revenue service on August 24, 2017, followed by the SCB-40, which inaugurated Brightline service on January 13, 2018.\n\n==Design==\nThe Charger is powered by a [[Cummins]] 16-cylinder QSK95 4-stroke high speed diesel engine, which is designed to meet [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] [[United States emission standards|Tier IV]] emissions standards that took effect in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dFKSVf9JAI|title=Siemens Charger locomotive receives a Cummins engine|first=|last=TRAINS Magazine|date=19 February 2016|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> Power output varies by model: the SCB-40 produces {{cvt|4000|hp|kW|lk=on}},<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Glucksman |first=Marc |date=2018 |title=The Siemens Diesel-Electric Series |journal=[[Passenger Train Journal]] |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=18\u201321}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.railwayage.com/news/brightline-going-biodiesel/|title=Brightline going biodiesel|last=C.

Four [[Insulated-gate bipolar transistor]] (IGBT) [[power inverter]]s carry electric current to each of the four AC [[traction motors]]. A static inverter off of the main prime mover supplies [[head-end power]] (HEP). The locomotive also features [[dynamic braking]] with regenerative capability, allowing the locomotive to divert power generated by dynamic braking away from the resistor grids to HEP and onboard locomotive auxiliary power demands.<ref name=\"c1\" />\n\nIn response to a 2013 [[Request for information|Request for Information]] from [[Metro-North Railroad]], Siemens said they might produce a
