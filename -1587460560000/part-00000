In the early 1960s, he was involved in the development of a liquid-powered Yugoslav surface-to-air missile called [[R-25 Vulkan]] (eng. Volcano) that could fly up to 25km attitude. The Yugoslav army had allegedly bought 6pcs of the Japanese research rocket [[Kappa (rocket)]] together with launch pad and radar that was used as basis of research for domestic anti aircraft rockets. In secret Japanese rocket served as a study object for domestic military development. Modeled on the [[Kappa (rocket)]], Obrad Vu\u010durovi\u0107 had the Volcano booster engine built at the Pretis (Vogos\u010da) military plant in Sarajevo. Together with Vladimir Ajvaz he developed the engine of the second stage of the Volcano on the basis of a liquid rocket in the \"SOKO\" aviation company in Mostar. With the purchase of the Kappa, Yugoslavia also got new basics formula for rocket fuels. Later SPS Vitez plant produced finished blocks of smokeless solid fuel from the chemical raw materials supplied from ZORKA (\u0160abac) and Vitkovi\u0107i (Gora\u017ede), which contributed to the further development of the engine of the R-262. \n\nObrad Vu\u010durovi\u0107 enjoyed a particularly prestigious position within the hierarchy of generals of the Yugoslav People's Army due to his engineering knowledge about completely new technology's in rocket construction. He was responsible not only for the development of weapon systems, but also for the series production of the military-industrial complex. Due to Obrad Vu\u010durovi\u0107, some of the large arms factories constructed in Yugoslavia had reached high technological and quality standards for military products, which some factories could no longer maintain after the collapse of the country.<ref>[https://rs-lat.sputniknews.com/analize/201708121112250152-rakete-Srbija-vojska-neutralnost/ \u0160ta je to srpski \u201eplamen\u201c \u2014 tajni recept za neutralnost dr\u017eave - Sputnjik Srbija<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nAs a pioneer of Yugoslav rocket development, his greatest achievements was the development of the R-262 rocket and the Yugoslav [[M-87 Orkan]] multiple rocket launcher system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vucurovic.com/|title=Obrad Vucurovic, Rocket design elements, Launcher design problems, Biography and Textbooks, Weapon systems gallery|last=Urosevic|first=Andrej|last2=Stojsic|first2=Vladimir|website=www.vucurovic.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-23|last3=Sakovic|first3=Danilo|last4=Tomasevic|first4=Marko}}</ref>\n\n== Rocket and missile system designs ==\n\n=== R-25 Vulkan ===\n\n[[R-25 Vulkan]] was surface to air rocket with development started in 1958. and  Obrad Vu\u010durovi\u0107 as led engineer.\n\n=== M-63 Plamen ===\n\n[[M-63 Plamen]] was developed in 1963 as multiple rocket launcher in 128mm caliber with Obrad Vu\u010durovi\u0107 as project manager and chief engineer of development. \n\n=== M-77 Oganj ===\n\n[[M-77 Oganj]]  self-propelled multiple rocket launcher development started in 1968. with Prof. Obrad Vucurevi\u0107, who leaded developing and managed construction and production of the M-77 Oganj.\n\n=== M-87 Orkan and M-96 Orkan II===\n\n[[M-87 Orkan]] is 262mm self-propelled multiple rocket launcher development started as part of KOL-15 project in 1978. Obrad Vu\u010durovi\u0107 had for KOL-15 significant financial backing both from Yugoslavia and Iraq. New rockets, launchers and vehicles where developed. Professor had practically all components designed by his engineers according to his plans, without paying to much attention to the costs as goal was to get best multiple rocket system at given time. The vehicle was also specially built in 8x8 configuration by FAP Priboj. From Germany, new equipment was bought from company Leifield for processes of cylinder press rolling for the formation of rocket engine chambers at the Pretis plant. The SPS Vitez imported new equipment for the extrusion of 160 kg of mew two-base smokeless solid fuel (NGR 375) for the chamber of the rocket engine. In total, in Yugoslavia, over 100 factories in the metal, chemical and automotive industries, telecommunications and electronics in Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia worked on the individual components of the weapon system KOL-15 and Orkan. The final montage on vehicles were don in factory \"Bratstvo\" in Novi Travnik, while complete rockets with detonators and fuel were finalized in Pretis-Unis (Vogo\u0161\u010da). Special new alloys were required when choosing the steel and aluminum alloys in order to withstand pressures by new rocket engine. In particular, the launchers' pipes had to meet the highest requirements. For them, high-performance steels were produced in the Ravna steel mill in Slovenia, and the finished pipes were further processed in Pretis-Unis Bosnia nad Herzegovina. During initial tests few versions where developed and more than 500 missiles were fired. In addition to the Prevlaka and Lu\u0161tica military test sites, it was Krivolak in the then Republic of Macedonia where the weapon system was also tested. The final tests for export customer took place in Iraq. A problem with the tests was the use of [[Cluster munition]] in rockets. It was not possible to use them at Prevlaka and Lu\u0161tica over the Adriatic sea in order to see their deployment and explosion solid ground was needed. In Krivolak, several villages and all livestock had to be evacuated beforehand, as the sub-munitions often in test covered more area than planned. The Orkan M-87 was publicly presented on December 18, 1987. After delivery in Iraq in 1990 in the 0th series started, production stopped in 1991. Besides Iraq Turkey used Orkan M-87 as basis of their [[TOROS artillery rocket system]] after illegally obtained launcher and blueprints form Muslims in Bosnia during war. In late 1990s M-96 Orkan II modification was developed on basis of ZIL-135 vehicles that where used as part of 9K52 Luna-M.\n\n=== RS-120 ===\n\nAs part of KOL15 project in 1989. started development of an army MRL RS-120 Uragan (eng.

A major focus is on [[Rashi]], considered the foremost Torah commentator.\n\nThe curriculum of Bais Yaakov differs from that of male-only [[yeshiva]]s, where the core component of study is the [[Talmud]]. Girls in Bais Yaakov schools do not learn law from the text of the Talmud itself, but may study its non-legal portions of ''[[aggadah]]'' (homiletics).

Also, in many Hasidic Beis Yaakov schools in Israel, English is often not taught, which is not the case in other Bais Yaakov schools.\n\nSchools for young Hasidic girls which are not part of the Bais Yaakov movement take names such as:\n\n* [[Beth Rivkah|Bais Rivkah]], Bnos Menachem, Bnos Rabbeinu, Bais [[Chaya Mushka Schneerson|Chaya Mushka]], or [[Bais Chana Women International|Bais Chana]] for the [[Chabad Lubavitch]] girls' schools.\n*  Bnos Zion for the [[Bobov (Hasidic dynasty)|Bobov]] girls' schools.\n*  Bnos Belz or Beis Malka for [[Belz (Hasidic dynasty)|Belz]] girls' schools.\n*  Bnos Vizhnitz for [[Vizhnitz (Hasidic dynasty)|Vizhnitz]] girls' schools.\n*  Beis Rochel schools for girls of the [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]] community, as well as some girls' schools of related Hasidic groups (often of Hungarian background). \n\nThese schools follow a different curriculum of Judaic studies, which is less text-based and more focused on practical knowledge than the curriculum in other schools. Within their communities, these schools are usually referred to as offering education ''al pi taharas kodesh'', roughly translating as \"holy, pure education\".\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Mesivta]]\n* [[Ulpana]]\n* [[Women in Judaism]]\n* [[Midrasha]]\n* [[Jewish_education #Girls' education]]\n* [[Hashkafa #Gender roles]]\n* [[Yeshiva #Types of yeshivot]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/schenirer-sarah/ Jewish Women's Archive: Sarah Schenirer]\n*[https://thebaisyaakovproject.com/ The Bais Yaakov Project]\n\n{{OrthodoxJudaism}}\n{{Jewish education}}\n\n[[Category:Orthodox Jewish schools for women]]\n[[Category:Jewish organizations established in 1917]]\n", "name_user": "Fintor", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCurriculum", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bais_Yaakov"}

Rajendra then appointed Guru Prasad Shah as the Chief of the Army for the operation of removal of Jung Bahadur Rana from Nepal and started to accumulate weapons and training the troops. Antagonism from the [[Company rule in India|British-India Company]] forced Rajendra and his troops to enter Nepal. On the 23rd of July, the troops reached a village called [[Alau, Nepal|Alau]] in Bara and set a camp there. One spy group of the Government of Nepal was keeping close eyes on the event of the rebel groups at [[Bettiah]]. They sent the news to Jung Bahadur, immediately after which he sent a troop in the leadership of Sanak Singh Tandon to Alau. They were told to suppress the rebellions, arrest Rajendra and bring him to Kathmandu. On the 27th of July, the ''Gorakhnath Paltan'' (Gorakhnath Battalion) reached and rested in a village called [[Simraungadh]], not too far from Alau. The battle of Alau was a decisive one between the forces of King Rajendra and Jang Bahadur. The King lost significantly in the battle. If the massacre of Kot had established Jung Bahadur as a dictator, the battle of Alau had helped him strengthen his dictatorship. Rajendra was imprisoned in an old palace in Bhaktapur.<ref name=\"Britanta\"/>\n=== Rise to royalty ===\nOn 15 May 1848, a Lal Mohar (Red sealed document) was issued claiming descent from [[Sisodia|Ranas of Mewar]] and authorizing the Kunwar family of Jang Bahadur to style themselves as '''Kunwar Ranaji'''.{{sfn|Whelpton|1991|p=253}} On 6 August 1856, Jang Bahadur Kunwar (now Ranaji) was conferred the title of [[Maharaja]] ('''Great King''') of Kaski and Lamjung, two former hill principalities, by King of Nepal, [[Surendra Bikram Shah]].{{sfn|Whelpton|1991|p=192}}\n\n==Rana Regime; Rule of the Shamshers==\n[[File:Bir_Shamsher JBR.jpg|thumb|[[Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana]], the first Shamsher Rana ruler]]\nIn 1885, the Shumsher family, the nephews of [[Jang Bahadur]], murdered many of the sons of [[Jung Bahadur]] and took over Nepal in a military [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] thus bringing in the rule of the Shamsher Rana family also known as the Satra Bhai (17 brothers) Rana family.

As time went on, it was revealed that he was not only a former [[Extramarital sex|paramour]] of Brady matriarch [[Caroline Brady|Caroline]], and the biological father of [[Bo Brady]], but that he was involved in various underhanded dealings around town.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/days-of-our-lives/bios/john-aniston/ |title=Days of our Lives \u2013 Bios \u2013 John Aniston as Victor Kiriakis |publisher=Nbc.com |accessdate=1 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nVictor was born in [[Nafplion]], [[Greece]], and emigrated to the United States with his family as a child.  He grew up and spent most of his childhood in rather modest circumstances in Salem, but then returned to Greece with his family as a young man, where he apparently made his fortune on both legitimate and [[organized crime|illegitimate]] fronts.\n\nInitially a quiet sponsor of a local drugs-and-prostitution ring, it was eventually fleshed out that Victor was a full-fledged [[mobster]], with [[Greek mafia|Mafia]] connections in [[Greece]] and Italy as well as throughout the US, partnerships and rivalries with other villains (including the nefarious [[Stefano DiMera]]), and was the subject of various investigations by the local police and a fictional crime-fighting spy agency called the International Security Alliance (ISA). Victor's organization engaged in many schemes and plots all over the world during the late 80s and early 90s, including selling military secrets to the [[Soviets]], hiding stolen [[Treasury bonds]] in Stockholm, [[Sweden]], and stealing a computer disk from the U.S. government that turned out to be made of an indestructible material with various potential military applications. It was during this heyday that even the music played at the beginning of Victor's scenes resembled the main theme of ''[[The Godfather]]''.\n\nNotably, Victor was the man most responsible for bringing the amnesiac [[John Black (Days of our Lives)|John Black]] to Salem in 1986, having \"outbid\" corrupt ISA chief George Nickerson for Black, who was \"offered up\" by the DiMera organization under the guise of possibly being the believed-dead [[Roman Brady]]. Victor also was part of the game called \"The Purse, The Power, and The Pawn\" in which he, Nickerson and Ileya Petrov; who had taken over the presumed dead Stefano Dimera's criminal enterprise, fought to get money and ultimately the biggest prize of them all; the Pawn, aka John black. Victor had Petrov killed in 1986 outside a cabin. But, in 2016 it came to light that somehow Petrov had moved to the United States in 1987 and worked for an academy that trained assassins which is where John Black was originally trained before having his memory wiped. Though, technically he was trained before that time. The writers changed the storyline. Victor worked to help restore Black's memory and learn his true identity, until Black escaped.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> (Victor became aware that Black wasn't the real Roman Brady, and was upset that he had been tricked by Stefano DiMera. Information contained in files in his possession ultimately led to the return of the real Roman, the \"Tale of Two Romans\" saga, and the surrounding Mexican caper involving the location of an ancient and mysterious Mayan treasure.)\n\nVictor is the father of [[Isabella Toscano]]. Eventually, Victor \"semi-retired\"; in an effort to win the love and respect of his children, he eventually renounced his evil ways and became a legitimate, albeit still ruthless, businessman. However, occasionally Victor will use some of his old [[underworld]] connections to help his family and friends out of a jam. The Kiriakis name still commands considerable respect (and fear) in the underworld; few criminals of standing would knowingly or willingly cross Victor Kiriakis (at least without the protection of the DiMeras or some other powerful organization.) At one point, his son Philip, young and irresponsible (probably because he grew up pampered due to his father's wealth,) foolishly became indebted through illegal gambling to a criminal gang, who injured him in a ritualistic manner as a warning to him to pay up. Victor recognized the injury from his old criminal dealings, and, as well as punishing his son Philip, warned the gang's head (who had not realized that his gang was harassing the son of Victor Kiriakis) both verbally and with violent retributory attacks to renounce Philip's indebtedness, blowing up the home of the mob boss by Niko, one of Victor's former bodyguards, after they made sure the home was empty. Even before Victor began his attacks, the man was extremely respectful merely at the realization that he was speaking with Victor Kiriakis, and very frightened and apologetic when he realized that he may have harassed his son. In more recent years, it's been slowly revealed that Victor and the Kiriakis organization still maintains a very strong hand in the [[underworld]], with deals and rivalries with the [[DiMera family (Days of our Lives)|DiMera family]] and other criminals.\n\nVictor was briefly married to [[Nicole Walker]], who had saved his life when Kate Roberts was trying to have him killed during [[Greta von Amberg|Greta's]] coronation. Nicole had an affair with Colin Murphy and Victor wanted a divorce. In February 2004, Nicole got [[Jan Spears]] to kill Victor by electrocuting him in his bathtub. Victor survived the attempt on his life and was held prisoner by [[Andre DiMera]] with other victims of the Salem Serial Killer. While on Melaswen, Victor kept a low profile and reconnected with his former love, Caroline Brady. Nicole was stunned when Victor returned to Salem in August 2005 and he made it his mission to get revenge.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nWhen Phillip went missing in action during his second tour, Victor reverted to his old ways and was disowned by both his son Bo, and grandson Shawn, because he attempted to take Shawn's daughter Claire for Philip (who had raised Claire since birth, believing the child to be legally his). Victor won Philip custody, but Claire was taken out of the country by Belle and Shawn. Philip eventually found them on the island of Tinda Lau, near Australia. After surviving a typhoon in the Pacific, Philip agreed to drop the pursuit of custody if Belle and Shawn would allow him to be a part of Claire's life, to which they were okay with. This disappointed Victor, but he has since learned to accept it.\n\nAfter a brief absence from Salem, Victor made a dramatic return during [[John Black (Days of our Lives)|John Black]]'s funeral, with an extremely moving eulogy to a man who was once his bitter enemy, but eventually became a beloved friend and trusted member of his family and inner circle. Victor made attempts to amend his relationship with Bo. Victor's relationship with Bo rebounded in early 2008 following the death of Shawn Sr. Victor's was there for Caroline and helped support her through her grief. Victor also took an active role in helping Bo overcome his illness by bringing his godson Dr. [[Daniel Jonas]] to Salem.\n\nVictor suffered from a stroke and was incapacitated at University Hospital under the care of Dr. Daniel Jonas. Somehow, Victor was aware that Bo had received evidence that would possibly implicate Philip in the disappearance of Paul Hollingsworth. Recovering in the hospital from his stroke, Victor commiserated with Kate and expressed his fear that the worst may be yet to come for Philip.\n\nOn December 22, 2008, Victor asked his grandson Brady Black to be the Vice CEO of Titan Industries. Brady and Arianna found he was once the drug lord before selling his business to [[EJ DiMera]]. When Vivian Alamain returns to town, Victor begins dating her once again, and marries her to protect his ex-wife Carly Manning from her wrath.\n\nIn late 2010 Victor befriends and soon develops feelings for [[Maggie Horton]]. While still married to Vivian Alamain, Victor begins to woo the recently widowed Maggie. Vivian is furious, and plots to bury Maggie alive out of jealousy. By chance, it is Vivian who is entombed, and after escaping, traps Maggie. Victor helps save her, but Maggie learns that Victor knew that Vivian had been in the casket and had done nothing. Freed due to lack of evidence against her, Vivian realizes that Victor loves Maggie and not her, and divorces Victor. Maggie and Victor are officially a couple as of March 2011, and have shared one long-awaited on-screen kiss. Victor and Maggie are married as of November 2011.\n\nVictor's character has finally developed into that of a rather crusty \"elder statesman\" of Salem, maintaining his position as the head of Titan Industries and the mighty Kiriakis family, but delegating more of the \"heavy lifting\" on both the legitimate and \"shadier\" fronts to other, younger family members and associates.  Victor's scenes have become fan favorites of late due to his biting sarcasm and witty one-liners, and his general desire to see family and friends safe and happy as he rounds out his twilight years.\nIn April 2014, Victor hosted his grandnephew Sonny's wedding to Will Horton.\n\nWhile Victor remained happily married to Maggie, his life took a dramatic turn when his much younger brother Deimos showed up in early 2016, blaming him for his imprisonment many years before Victor settled in Salem. Deimos vowed to steal everything that Victor held near and dear, and even arranged for Maggie to have an accident which lead her to break her back and crippled once again. Maggie struggled for many months to re-gain the use of her legs, dealing with severe depression as a result, but with patience from Victor, was able once again to walk. Victor was shocked also during this time by the sudden murder of his arch-enemy Stefano DiMera by his daughter-in-law, Hope Brady.\n\n== References and notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{notelist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://soapcentral.com/days/whoswho/victor.php Victor at '''soap'''central.'''com''']\n\n{{Days of Our Lives}}\n{{Days of Our Lives characters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kiriakis, Victor}}\n[[Category:Days of Our Lives characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Fictional business executives]]\n[[Category:Fictional mobsters]]\n[[Category:Fictional Greek people in television]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1985]]\n[[Category:Male characters in television]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2019}}\n{{short description|Fictional character on NBC's Days of Our Lives}}\n{{Infobox soap character\n| series   = Days of our Lives\n| image1   = File:John Aniston as Victor Kiriakis.jpg\n| caption1 = \n| first    = July 19, 1985\n| cause    =\n| years    = 1985\u2013\n| creator  = [[Sheri Anderson]], [[Thom Racina]] and [[Leah Laiman]]\n| introducer = [[Betty Corday]], [[Ken Corday]] and [[Al Rabin]]\n| classification = [[Days of Our Lives cast members#Recurring cast|Present, recurring]]\n| portrayer = [[John Aniston]]\n| episode =\n| nickname =\n| alias =\n| species =\n| gender = Male\n| age = 86\n| born = May 17, 1933\n| death =\n| occupation = {{Plainlist |\n* [[Boss (crime)|Crime boss]] \n* Businessman\n* [[Drug lord]]\n}}\n| title =\n| residence = {{Plainlist |\n* Kiriakis Mansion\n* 13201 Glen Oaks Drive\n* [[Salem (Days of Our Lives)|Salem]], [[Illinois]]\n}}\n| callsign =\n| family = Kiriakis\n| parents = Yurgos Kiriakis <br> Sophie Kiriakis\n| brothers = Alexander Kiriakis<br>Titus Kiriakis\n| halfbrothers = [[Days of Our Lives characters (2010s)#Deimos Kiriakis|Deimos Kiriakis]]\n| grandparents = Demetrius Kiriakis <br> Antonia Kiriakis\n| aunts/uncles = Aristotle Kiriakis <br> Athena Kiriakis\n| nephews = [[Justin Kiriakis]] <br> [[Days of Our Lives characters (2010s)#Xander Kiriakis|Xander Kiriakis]] \n| spouse = {{unbulleted list|[[Carly Manning]] (1991\u201392)<ref>https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nXkEAAAAIBAJ&sjid=TT4DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6913%2C144492</ref>|[[Kate Roberts (Days of our Lives)|Kate Roberts]] (1993\u201395){{efn|Victor and Kate were originally married on September 8, 1993.

His time on the show has been since 1985 with a storyline driven absence in 2004 when his character was \"killed off\" but found alive on the island of Melaswen.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soapoperadigest.com/features/days-of-our-lives/features/murderlist/ |title=Days of Our Lives \u2013 Salem Stalker Murders \u2013 Soap Opera Digest and Weekly |publisher=Soapoperadigest.com |accessdate=1 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125152759/http://soapoperadigest.com/features/days-of-our-lives/features/murderlist/ |archive-date=25 January 2010 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\n== Character history ==\nVictor came to Salem in 1985 as an old friend of the Brady clan. As time went on, it was revealed that he was not only a former [[Extramarital sex|paramour]] of Brady matriarch [[Caroline Brady|Caroline]], and the biological father of [[Bo Brady]], but that he was involved in various underhanded dealings around town.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/days-of-our-lives/bios/john-aniston/ |title=Days of our Lives \u2013 Bios \u2013 John Aniston as Victor Kiriakis |publisher=Nbc.com |accessdate=1 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nVictor was born in [[Nafplion]], [[Greece]], and emigrated to the United States with his family as a child.  He grew up and spent most of his childhood in rather modest circumstances in Salem, but then returned to Greece with his family as a young man, where he apparently made his fortune on both legitimate and [[organized crime|illegitimate]] fronts.\n\nInitially a quiet sponsor of a local drugs-and-prostitution ring, it was eventually fleshed out that Victor was a full-fledged [[mobster]], with [[Greek mafia|Mafia]] connections in [[Greece]] and Italy as well as throughout the US, partnerships and rivalries with other villains (including the nefarious [[Stefano DiMera]]), and was the subject of various investigations by the local police and a fictional crime-fighting spy agency called the International Security Alliance (ISA). Victor's organization engaged in many schemes and plots all over the world during the late 80s and early 90s, including selling military secrets to the [[Soviets]], hiding stolen [[Treasury bonds]] in Stockholm, [[Sweden]], and stealing a computer disk from the U.S. government that turned out to be made of an indestructible material with various potential military applications. It was during this heyday that even the music played at the beginning of Victor's scenes resembled the main theme of ''[[The Godfather]]''.\n\nNotably, Victor was the man most responsible for bringing the amnesiac [[John Black (Days of our Lives)|John Black]] to Salem in 1986, having \"outbid\" corrupt ISA chief George Nickerson for Black, who was \"offered up\" by the DiMera organization under the guise of possibly being the believed-dead [[Roman Brady]]. Victor also was part of the game called \"The Purse, The Power, and The Pawn\" in which he, Nickerson and Ileya Petrov; who had taken over the presumed dead Stefano Dimera's criminal enterprise, fought to get money and ultimately the biggest prize of them all; the Pawn, aka John black. Victor had Petrov killed in 1986 outside a cabin. But, in 2016 it came to light that somehow Petrov had moved to the United States in 1987 and worked for an academy that trained assassins which is where John Black was originally trained before having his memory wiped. Though, technically he was trained before that time. The writers changed the storyline. Victor worked to help restore Black's memory and learn his true identity, until Black escaped.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> (Victor became aware that Black wasn't the real Roman Brady, and was upset that he had been tricked by Stefano DiMera. Information contained in files in his possession ultimately led to the return of the real Roman, the \"Tale of Two Romans\" saga, and the surrounding Mexican caper involving the location of an ancient and mysterious Mayan treasure.)\n\nVictor is the father of [[Isabella Toscano]]. Eventually, Victor \"semi-retired\"; in an effort to win the love and respect of his children, he eventually renounced his evil ways and became a legitimate, albeit still ruthless, businessman. However, occasionally Victor will use some of his old [[underworld]] connections to help his family and friends out of a jam. The Kiriakis name still commands considerable respect (and fear) in the underworld; few criminals of standing would knowingly or willingly cross Victor Kiriakis (at least without the protection of the DiMeras or some other powerful organization.) At one point, his son Philip, young and irresponsible (probably because he grew up pampered due to his father's wealth,) foolishly became indebted through illegal gambling to a criminal gang, who injured him in a ritualistic manner as a warning to him to pay up. Victor recognized the injury from his old criminal dealings, and, as well as punishing his son Philip, warned the gang's head (who had not realized that his gang was harassing the son of Victor Kiriakis) both verbally and with violent retributory attacks to renounce Philip's indebtedness, blowing up the home of the mob boss by Niko, one of Victor's former bodyguards, after they made sure the home was empty. Even before Victor began his attacks, the man was extremely respectful merely at the realization that he was speaking with Victor Kiriakis, and very frightened and apologetic when he realized that he may have harassed his son. In more recent years, it's been slowly revealed that Victor and the Kiriakis organization still maintains a very strong hand in the [[underworld]], with deals and rivalries with the [[DiMera family (Days of our Lives)|DiMera family]] and other criminals.\n\nVictor was briefly married to [[Nicole Walker]], who had saved his life when Kate Roberts was trying to have him killed during [[Greta von Amberg|Greta's]] coronation. Nicole had an affair with Colin Murphy and Victor wanted a divorce. In February 2004, Nicole got [[Jan Spears]] to kill Victor by electrocuting him in his bathtub. Victor survived the attempt on his life and was held prisoner by [[Andre DiMera]] with other victims of the Salem Serial Killer. While on Melaswen, Victor kept a low profile and reconnected with his former love, Caroline Brady. Nicole was stunned when Victor returned to Salem in August 2005 and he made it his mission to get revenge.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nWhen Phillip went missing in action during his second tour, Victor reverted to his old ways and was disowned by both his son Bo, and grandson Shawn, because he attempted to take Shawn's daughter Claire for Philip (who had raised Claire since birth, believing the child to be legally his). Victor won Philip custody, but Claire was taken out of the country by Belle and Shawn. Philip eventually found them on the island of Tinda Lau, near Australia. After surviving a typhoon in the Pacific, Philip agreed to drop the pursuit of custody if Belle and Shawn would allow him to be a part of Claire's life, to which they were okay with. This disappointed Victor, but he has since learned to accept it.\n\nAfter a brief absence from Salem, Victor made a dramatic return during [[John Black (Days of our Lives)|John Black]]'s funeral, with an extremely moving eulogy to a man who was once his bitter enemy, but eventually became a beloved friend and trusted member of his family and inner circle. Victor made attempts to amend his relationship with Bo. Victor's relationship with Bo rebounded in early 2008 following the death of Shawn Sr. Victor's was there for Caroline and helped support her through her grief. Victor also took an active role in helping Bo overcome his illness by bringing his godson Dr. [[Daniel Jonas]] to Salem.\n\nVictor suffered from a stroke and was incapacitated at University Hospital under the care of Dr. Daniel Jonas. Somehow, Victor was aware that Bo had received evidence that would possibly implicate Philip in the disappearance of Paul Hollingsworth. Recovering in the hospital from his stroke, Victor commiserated with Kate and expressed his fear that the worst may be yet to come for Philip.\n\nOn December 22, 2008, Victor asked his grandson Brady Black to be the Vice CEO of Titan Industries. Brady and Arianna found he was once the drug lord before selling his business to [[EJ DiMera]]. When Vivian Alamain returns to town, Victor begins dating her once again, and marries her to protect his ex-wife Carly Manning from her wrath.\n\nIn late 2010 Victor befriends and soon develops feelings for [[Maggie Horton]]. While still married to Vivian Alamain, Victor begins to woo the recently widowed Maggie. Vivian is furious, and plots to bury Maggie alive out of jealousy. By chance, it is Vivian who is entombed, and after escaping, traps Maggie. Victor helps save her, but Maggie learns that Victor knew that Vivian had been in the casket and had done nothing. Freed due to lack of evidence against her, Vivian realizes that Victor loves Maggie and not her, and divorces Victor. Maggie and Victor are officially a couple as of March 2011, and have shared one long-awaited on-screen kiss.

Its Ballynary line is descended from Shean Duff O'Higgins ([[floruit|fl.]] 1600 C.E.), Gaelic Baron of Ballynary, who was married to a daughter of the [[O'Conor Don|royal family of O'Conor]] at Ballintuber Castle in Connacht. Shean Duff O'Higgins himself claimed descent from King Niall of [[Hill of Tara|Tara]] (d. 450 C.E.).<ref>The National Genealogical Office (Dublin), MS 165. p. 396-399.</ref><ref>''Annals of the Four Masters'' M378-405</ref><ref>Geoffrey Keating, Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn 1.48, 1.49, 1.50, 51, 52</ref> Historically, many of their ancestors were poets and scholars who enjoyed the patronage of several chiefly families including [[O'Conor Don]], [[MacDermott (disambiguation)|MacDermott]], [[O'Doherty]], [[O'Gara]], and [[MacDonagh]].\n\nO'Higgins are counted among the Gaelic nobility as a [[sept]] of the [[O'Neill dynasty|royal house of O'Neill]].<ref>See [[List of Irish clans]].The National Genealogical Office (Dublin), MS 165. p. 396-399.</ref><ref>Genealogy of \u00d3 hUiginn from O Clery Book of Genealogies (based on edition by S\u00e9amus Pender, Analecta Hibernica 15, 1951)</ref> Members of this family were further ennobled in 1724 by [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James III]] ([[pretender]] to the throne of England and Ireland) during his exile in France, and again in 1795 and 1796 by [[Charles IV of Spain]].\n\n==Family name==\nEarlier scholars traced the origin of the name from the word \"knowledge\" in Irish, possible linked to the family's early prominence as bards to the Gaelic Kings.<ref>letter from Prof. E\u00f3in Mac Neill to Prof. Knott written in December 1919.</ref> However, more recent scholars have identified that \"uigin\" refers to a Norse seafarer or Viking.<ref>The bardic poems of Tadhg Dall \u00d3 hUiginn (1550\u20131591), [[Eleanor Knott]] (ed.), London, 1920 and 1926</ref> In Gaelic times the prefix U\u00ed before a name was used to signify descent from a grandson, this family are said to have descended from the grandson of Uiginn who lived in the 11th century or possibly from a previous Uiginn who was a grandson of King Niall of Tara. In modern times the surname has often been translated from Irish into \"Higgins\" in English although members the more senior branches of the family continue to use \"O'Higgins\".\n\n===Background===\nThe O'Higgins family originated in the [[Kingdom of Meath]] and [[Kings of Brega|Brega]] which equate to the modern Irish counties of [[County Meath|Meath]] and [[Westmeath]]. As a [[sept]] of the [[Southern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill]] their roots in these areas can be traced at least to the 5th century and possibly even earlier. By the 12th century the senior branch of the family had migrated into the [[Kingdom of Connacht]] where they settled and were granted large estates by the [[O'Conor Don|O'Conors]] in [[Sligo]] at Dooghorne and Monteige in the Barony of [[Luighne Connacht|Luighne]] under the protection of the O'Hara Chiefs and at [[Ballynary]] in the Barony of Tir-Errill under the protection of the MacDonagh Chiefs.\n\nFrom the Council of Drom Ceat in 574 AD up to the end of the Gaelic era in the 17th century various members of the O'Higgins clan were hereditary poets (''fil\u00e9s'' in Irish) in the courts of [[Chiefs of the Name|Irish Princes and Chiefs]].<ref>The Book of Glendalough Rawlinson MS B 502 Oxford, Bodleian Library c. AD 1130</ref><ref>Keating, G. The History of Ireland. Section 10.</ref> As hereditary poets they were accorded a status of nobility second in rank only to the King and were entitled to wear the same number of colours in their robes. Members of this family came under the patronage of other Irish noble houses particularly [[O'Conor Don|\u00d3 Conor]], [[O'Neill dynasty|\u00d3 Neill]], MacDonagh, [[O'Rourke|\u00d3 Rourke]], [[Maguire (surname)|Maguire]], [[O'Doherty family|\u00d3 Doherty]], [[Mac Diarmata|Mac Dermot]] and [[\u00d3 Gadhra|\u00d3 Gara]]. From the 14th to the 17th centuries the O'Higgins were among the most prolific poets in the courts of the Irish Princes.:<ref>Eleanor Knott, Bardic Poems of Tadhg Dall \u00d3 hUiginn (1922), I, xx\u2013xxii:</ref>\n\n===Loss of status and migration===\nDue to their loyalty to Gaelic culture and religion, the O'Higgins family of Ballynary suffered under the English Crown in [[Ireland]] and by 1654 had lost their lands in Sligo.<ref>O'Rorke, T. (1889) \"The History of Sligo Town and County Vol. II \u2013 Conclusion\" (Dublin: Duffy & Company).</ref> While some members of the family remained in Sligo as tenants on their own lands, some members of the family migrated to [[Spain]] where they achieved high office in the service of the King. The O'Higgins of Ballynary migrated to Summerhill in Co. Meath where they lived at Clondoogan and Agher.\n\nIn 1751 [[Ambrose O'Higgins]] (ca. 1720\u20131801) left [[Summerhill, County Meath|Summerhill]] in Co. [[County Meath|Meath]] for [[Cadiz]] in Spain from where he went to [[Peru]] and [[Chile]]. In 1788 he became [[Royal Governor of Chile|Governor General]] of [[Chile]]. He was ennobled by [[King Carlos IV|King Carlos IV of Spain]] initially in 1795 as 1st Bar\u00f3n de Ballinar and again in 1796 when he was raised to Marqu\u00e9s de Osorno.<ref>Letters patent from King Carlos IV 27 January 1796 in Archives of the Indies.</ref> His son [[Bernardo O'Higgins]] became the first Head of State of [[Chile]] in 1818. His son Pedro Demetrio O'Higgins Puga (1818\u20131868) was a Chilean politician and entrepreneur. Ambrose O'Higgins' brother William (Guillermo) O`Higgins (1722\u20131772) was Captain of the Spanish troops and Colonial Administrator in Paraguay.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Portrait of Ambrosio O'Higgins.jpg|Ambrosio O'Higgins, 1st Marquis of Osorno.\nFile:Bernardo O\u00b4Higgins por Ceballos.JPG|Bernardo O'Higgins (1778-1842), 1st Head of State of Chile.\nFile:Demetrio O\u00b4Higgins.jpg|Pedro Demetrio O'Higgins Puga (1818-1868), Chilean Politician and Entrepreneur.\n</gallery>\n\nThe [[Ballynary]] line of the O'Higgins family continued at [[Summerhill, County Meath|Summerhill]] in [[County Meath]] until 1947. Karl Aiden O'Higgins of [[Cheshire]] in England now represents the family title.\n\n[[John Higgins of Montoge|Sir John Higgins]] Bt of Monteige, kinsman to the O'Higgins of Ballynary, was knighted and ennobled by (soi-disant) King [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James III]] in 1724 in return for his services to France. He was senior physician to the King of Spain.

Its Ballynary line is descended from Shean Duff O'Higgins ([[floruit|fl.]] 1600 C.E.), Gaelic Baron of Ballynary, who was married to a daughter of the [[O'Conor Don|royal family of O'Conor]] at Ballintuber Castle in Connacht. Shean Duff O'Higgins himself claimed descent from King Niall of [[Hill of Tara|Tara]] (d. 450 C.E.).<ref>The National Genealogical Office (Dublin), MS 165. p. 396-399.</ref><ref>''Annals of the Four Masters'' M378-405</ref><ref>Geoffrey Keating, Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn 1.48, 1.49, 1.50, 51, 52</ref> Historically, many of their ancestors were poets and scholars who enjoyed the patronage of several chiefly families including [[O'Conor Don]], [[MacDermott (disambiguation)|MacDermott]], [[O'Doherty]], [[O'Gara]], and [[MacDonagh]].\n\nO'Higgins are counted among the Gaelic nobility as a sept of the [[O'Neill dynasty|royal house of O'Neill]].<ref>See [[List of Irish clans]].The National Genealogical Office (Dublin), MS 165. p. 396-399.</ref><ref>Genealogy of \u00d3 hUiginn from O Clery Book of Genealogies (based on edition by S\u00e9amus Pender, Analecta Hibernica 15, 1951)</ref> Members of this family were further ennobled in 1724 by [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James III]] ([[pretender]] to the throne of England and Ireland) during his in exile in France, and again in 1795 and 1796 by [[Charles IV of Spain]].\n\n==Family name==\nEarlier scholars traced the origin of the name from the word \"knowledge\" in Irish, possible linked to the family's early prominence as bards to the Gaelic Kings.<ref>letter from Prof. E\u00f3in Mac Neill to Prof. Knott written in December 1919.</ref> However, more recent scholars have identified that \"uigin\" refers to a Norse seafarer or Viking.<ref>The bardic poems of Tadhg Dall \u00d3 hUiginn (1550\u20131591), [[Eleanor Knott]] (ed.), London, 1920 and 1926</ref> In Gaelic times the prefix U\u00ed before a name was used to signify descent from a grandson, this family are said to have descended from the grandson of Uiginn who lived in the 11th century or possibly from a previous Uiginn who was a grandson of King Niall of Tara. In modern times the surname has often been translated from Irish into \"Higgins\" in English although members the more senior branches of the family continue to use \"O'Higgins\".\n\n===Background===\nThe O'Higgins family originated in the [[Kingdom of Meath]] and [[Kings of Brega|Brega]] which equate to the modern Irish counties of [[County Meath|Meath]] and [[Westmeath]]. As a [[sept]] of the [[Southern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill]] their roots in these areas can be traced at least to the 5th century and possibly even earlier. By the 12th century the senior branch of the family had migrated into the [[Kingdom of Connacht]] where they settled and were granted large estates by the [[O'Conor Don|O'Conors]] in [[Sligo]] at Dooghorne and Monteige in the Barony of [[Luighne Connacht|Luighne]] under the protection of the O'Hara Chiefs and at [[Ballynary]] in the Barony of Tir-Errill under the protection of the MacDonagh Chiefs.\n\nFrom the Council of Drom Ceat in 574 AD up to the end of the Gaelic era in the 17th century various members of the O'Higgins clan were hereditary poets (''fil\u00e9s'' in Irish) in the courts of [[Chiefs of the Name|Irish Princes and Chiefs]].<ref>The Book of Glendalough Rawlinson MS B 502 Oxford, Bodleian Library c. AD 1130</ref><ref>Keating, G. The History of Ireland. Section 10.</ref> As hereditary poets they were accorded a status of nobility second in rank only to the King and were entitled to wear the same number of colours in their robes. Members of this family came under the patronage of other Irish noble houses particularly [[O'Conor Don|\u00d3 Conor]], [[O'Neill dynasty|\u00d3 Neill]], MacDonagh, [[O'Rourke|\u00d3 Rourke]], [[Maguire (surname)|Maguire]], [[O'Doherty family|\u00d3 Doherty]], [[Mac Diarmata|Mac Dermot]] and [[\u00d3 Gadhra|\u00d3 Gara]]. From the 14th to the 17th centuries the O'Higgins were among the most prolific poets in the courts of the Irish Princes.:<ref>Eleanor Knott, Bardic Poems of Tadhg Dall \u00d3 hUiginn (1922), I, xx\u2013xxii:</ref>\n\n===Loss of status and migration===\nDue to their loyalty to Gaelic culture and religion, the O'Higgins family of Ballynary suffered under the English Crown in [[Ireland]] and by 1654 had lost their lands in Sligo.<ref>O'Rorke, T. (1889) \"The History of Sligo Town and County Vol. II \u2013 Conclusion\" (Dublin: Duffy & Company).</ref> While some members of the family remained in Sligo as tenants on their own lands, some members of the family migrated to [[Spain]] where they achieved high office in the service of the King. The O'Higgins of Ballynary migrated to Summerhill in Co. Meath where they lived at Clondoogan and Agher.\n\nIn 1751 [[Ambrose O'Higgins]] (ca. 1720\u20131801) left [[Summerhill, County Meath|Summerhill]] in Co. [[County Meath|Meath]] for [[Cadiz]] in Spain from where he went to [[Peru]] and [[Chile]]. In 1788 he became [[Royal Governor of Chile|Governor General]] of [[Chile]]. He was ennobled by [[King Carlos IV|King Carlos IV of Spain]] initially in 1795 as 1st Bar\u00f3n de Ballinar and again in 1796 when he was raised to Marqu\u00e9s de Osorno.<ref>Letters patent from King Carlos IV 27 January 1796 in Archives of the Indies.</ref> His son [[Bernardo O'Higgins]] became the first Head of State of [[Chile]] in 1818. His son Pedro Demetrio O'Higgins Puga (1818\u20131868) was a Chilean politician and entrepreneur. Ambrose O'Higgins' brother William (Guillermo) O`Higgins (1722\u20131772) was Captain of the Spanish troops and Colonial Administrator in Paraguay.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Portrait of Ambrosio O'Higgins.jpg|Ambrosio O'Higgins, 1st Marquis of Osorno.\nFile:Bernardo O\u00b4Higgins por Ceballos.JPG|Bernardo O'Higgins (1778-1842), 1st Head of State of Chile.\nFile:Demetrio O\u00b4Higgins.jpg|Pedro Demetrio O'Higgins Puga (1818-1868), Chilean Politician and Entrepreneur.\n</gallery>\n\nThe [[Ballynary]] line of the O'Higgins family continued at [[Summerhill, County Meath|Summerhill]] in [[County Meath]] until 1947.

Abe joins the Salem Police Department determined to rid the city of filth, including international crime lord, [[Stefano DiMera]].\n\nAbe is the police officer who investigates [[Anna Brady]]'s claim that she was sold into white slavery. She reports the existence of her secret Swiss bank account to her husband, [[Roman Brady]].\n\nHe has a relationship with a woman named Nikki Wade, but this is cut short after he stands her up at a d\u00e9butante ball in favor of heading up a drug bust. He was also in two short-lived relationships with Dr. [[Valerie Grant]] and singer Tamara Price, with whom he fathered a daughter [[Lani Price]]. Before Abe's promotion to police chief, he meets and marries [[Lexie Carver|Alexandra (Lexie) Brooks]]. Just after their marriage, Lexie searches through Aremid's files for her adoption records. She finds out that her aunt Frankie Brooks ([[Celeste Perrault]]) is actually her mother and that her father is [[Stefano DiMera]]. Conflict has risen many times in Abe and Lexie's marriage due to the presence of Stefano in their life.\n\nHis next major storyline involves the Aremid wedding of [[Peter Blake (Days of Our Lives)|Peter Blake]] and [[Jennifer Deveraux]]. Abe is caught up in the investigation of [[Tony DiMera]]'s murder. Abe and Lexi go to Paris to find [[Marlena Evans]] when Stefano kidnapped her. They end up finding and saving Marlena and catching Stefano but are unable to prosecute him, because only Stefano has a drug that can save Roman's life. Abe, Lexi, and [[John Black (Days of our Lives)|John Black]] help break Stefano out of jail and later he is pardoned for his crimes after returning to Salem with the drug Roman needed.\n\nLater, Abe and Lexie adopt baby Isaac, thinking he is the child of DiMera henchman [[Wilhelm Rolf]]. Isaac is actually the son of [[Bo Brady]] and [[Hope Brady]] who was switched at birth by Stefano. Abe is later appalled to learn that Lexie knew of the switch, but hides the truth from him. Abe files for divorce but after Lexie helps Hope, Brady and her son Zack, Lexie and Abe reconcile.\n\nShortly after, [[Brandon Walker]] comes to Salem with a deep hatred of Abe. Lexie sleeps with Brandon in a weak moment and becomes pregnant, unsure if Abe or Brandon is the father. It is revealed Abe is the father and Lexie and Abe reconcile for good. Brandon's presence causes issues for Abe until it is revealed that Brandon is Abe's illegitimate son with [[Fay Walker]]. After some time, Abe and Brandon embrace each other as family, and have since had a good relationship.\n\nAbe is shot dead on the day of Theo's christening. He is the first victim of the 2003 Salem serial killer. Months later he turns up on a remote tropical island, (melaswen/newsalem) which is a complete replica of Salem. Although his \"ghost\" started appearing to Celeste and Lexie while he was supposedly dead, (this was not explained). He works together with Roman and the others and got off the island. Abe is reunited with Lexie and Theo but goes blind and learns he is impotent. His anger shines through and he becomes paranoid that Lexie is cheating. Eventually, Abe's eyesight is restored but an anonymous note leads him to a motel where he finds Lexie having sex with his protege Salem Police officer [[Tek Kramer]]. Their marriage is in turmoil for a while until Abe uses Lexie in the investigation of her half-brother [[EJ DiMera]], then Abe falls back in love with her. They stay together until Lexie disappeared on December 29, 2006.\n\nHis eyesight starts deteriorate again and he undergoes a second retina transplant. At the same time, Lexie is found in the tunnels under Doug's Place and the DiMera mansion, where [[Andre DiMera]] has kept her all these months against her will. The transplant successful, Abe has returned to work as the Commissioner of the Salem Police Department. In the fall of 2010 Abe returned full-time to the screen. He began investigating the murders of the people of Salem, because he did not want anyone going through what he already had. However, the tables may turn on him when Stefano decided that he was going to frame Abe for the murders. In June 2012, Lexie, who had cancer, died peacefully in Abe's arms.\n\n== Cultural impact ==\n[[James Reynolds (actor)|James Reynolds]]' portrayal of Abe Carver since 1981 has made Abe the longest-running African American character in American [[soap opera]] history.<ref name=\"TV Guide\">{{cite news |title= The Killer Strikes (''TV Guide'', October 4\u201310, 2003)|publisher=[[TV Guide]]}}</ref>  Having logged more hours on television than most actors, Reynolds is also a humanitarian<ref>Detroit news interview with James Reynolds [http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071206/LIFESTYLE05/712060391/1042/LIFESTYLE05] December 6, 2007.</ref> and his work on ''Days of our Lives'' helps continue his work.
