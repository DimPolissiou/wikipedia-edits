In the ''Chicago Tribune,'' Pablo Gorondi complimented Daltrey for, \"sing(ing) with power, sensitivity, range and conviction, just as he has done for decades,\" and called Townshend's voice a \"highlight,\" while still \"rip(ping) power chords and perform(ing) slinky riffs.\"<ref>https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/ct-ent-the-who-who-album-review-20191206-dqqjqxn5wjgbvdrblffskbuuyq-story.html</ref> Gorondi continued his praise by stating that the dominant reasons why the album was \"such a joy\" were due to \"Townshend's songwriting and guitar playing and Daltrey's superlative singing.\"<ref>https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/ct-ent-the-who-who-album-review-20191206-dqqjqxn5wjgbvdrblffskbuuyq-story.html</ref>\n\nConceptually, the album tackles the struggles of being an elderly rock musician, as ''Guardian'' writer, Alexis Petridis noted. \"Townshend seems more troubled than ever,\" Petridis stated, and this feeling overlaps into songs such as \"I Don't Wanna Get Wise,\" which according to Petridis, \"...views a rock career as one of inevitable decline.\"<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/28/the-who-who-review-back-and-still-causing-a-big-sensation</ref> Musically, the album sounds like a \"traditional\" Who record. ''Senior Rolling Stone'' writer, Kory Grow, called ''WHO'',\"classic rock comfort food\" and commented on the its nostalgic feel: \"...Townshend and Daltrey...can still summon their inner Who-ness in their mid 70s.\"<ref>https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/the-who-who-review-919564/</ref> Likewise, ''Ultimate Classic Rock'''s senior editor, Michael Gallucci, reflected on how the band's newest album sounds more like a \"conventional\" Who record, despite the album being thematically different from any of their previous works: \"It's a throwback record for the most part, with nods all over the place to their classic work. It's not a retread, but it sounds like a Who album, which is crucial for something like this, as well as an upgrade for the 21st century.\"<ref>https://ultimateclassicrock.com/the-who-who-album-review/</ref>\n\nDespite the praises for its 1970s rock sound and Daltrey and Townshend's performances, ''WHO'' has received criticism. According to Matthew Taub of ''Consequence of Sound'', some tracks are \"not particularly well conceived,\" citing songs such as \"Detour\" and \"Hero Ground Zero,\" as \"just sit(ting) there\" or \"feeling more like an intermission.\"<ref>https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/11/album-review-the-who-who/</ref> Taub also commented that the track, \"Break the News,\" which was written by Townshend's younger brother, Simon, sounded like it was, \"plucked from some kind of factory for generic acoustic pop songs \u2014 somehow like 100 other songs you\u2019ve heard, yet none you can actually name.\"<ref>https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/11/album-review-the-who-who/</ref> Another complaint was the generational tone of the album. Chris Willman from ''Variety'' stated,\"There are hints of mirth amid the crotchetiness. Right in the opening line, when Daltrey sings \u201cI don\u2019t care, I know you\u2019re gonna hate this song,\u201d followed later by \u201cI don\u2019t mind other guys ripping off my song.\u201d\"<ref>https://variety.com/2019/music/news/the-who-album-review-1203426754/</ref> ''New Musical Express'' journalist, Mark Beaumont, similarly noted this theme with the track, \"I Don't Wanna Get Wise\": \"...(it) almost reads like a 75-year-old Daltrey talking to the drunk and tardy 20-year-old who sang 'My Generation.'\"<ref>https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/the-who-who-review-13-years-since-their-last-album-this-stands-up-alongside-their-classics-2580985</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\nAll songs written by [[Pete Townshend]] except where noted.\n{{Track listing\n| title1 = All This Music Must Fade\n| length1 = 3:20\n| title2 = [[Ball and Chain (The Who song)|Ball and Chain]]\n| length2 = 4:29\n| title3 = I Don't Wanna Get Wise\n| length3 = 3:54\n| title4 = Detour\n| length4 = 3:46\n| title5 = Beads on One String\n| length5 = 3:40\n| note5 = Pete Townshend and Josh Hunsaker\n| title6 = Hero Ground Zero\n| length6 = 4:52\n| title7 = Street Song\n| length7 = 4:47\n| title8 = I'll Be Back\n| length8 = 5:01\n| title9 = Break the News\n| length9 = 4:30\n| note9 = [[Simon Townshend]]\n| title10 = Rockin' in Rage\n| length10 = 4:04\n| title11 = She Rocked My World\n| length11 = 3:22\n}}\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed = no\n| headline = Deluxe edition bonus tracks\n| title12 = This Gun Will Misfire\n| length12 = 3:36\n| title13 = Got Nothing to Prove\n| length13 = 3:38\n| title14 = Danny and My Ponies\n| length14 = 4:02\n| title15 = Sand\n| length15 = 4:27\n| note15 = Demo, Japan only\n}}\n\n==Personnel==\nAdapted from compact disc liner notes and online liner notes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/The-Who-Who/release/14492734|title=The Who - Who|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref>\n===The Who===\n*[[Pete Townshend]]: guitars, backing vocals, lead vocals (tracks 8, 12\u201314), harmonicas, percussion, synthesizer tracks, violin, cello, hurdy-gurdy, effects, orchestration (6)\n*[[Roger Daltrey]]: lead vocals (except 8, 12\u201314)\n\n===Additional personnel===\n*[[Pino Palladino]]: bass (1-2, 4-8, 11-12)\n*[[Zak Starkey]]: drums (1-2, 4, 7)\n*[[Simon Townshend]]: percussion\n*[[Dave Sardy]]: percussion, mellotron, synthesizer programming (5)\n*[[Joey Waronker]]: drums (5, 8, 11-12)\n*[[Benmont Tench]]: organ, mellotron\n*Gus Seyffert: bass (3, 9-10)\n*[[Carla Azar]]: drums (3, 10)\n*[[Matt Chamberlain]]: drums (6)\n*Josh Tyrrell: handclaps (4)\n*Rowan McIntosh: handclaps (4)\n*Martin Batchelar: programming (6), orchestration (6, 8), orchestra arrangement (8), orchestra conducting (6, 8, 13)\n*[[Rachel Fuller]]: orchestration (6)\n*Peter Rotter: orchestra fixer (6, 8, 13)\n*Bruce Dukov: orchestra leader (6, 8, 13)\n*Andrew Synowiec: acoustic guitar (9)\n*[[Gordon Giltrap]]: acoustic guitar (11)\n*Fergus Gerrand: percussion (11)\n\n==Charts==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

In the ''Chicago Tribune,'' Pablo Gorondi complimented Daltrey for, \"sing(ing) with power, sensitivity, range and conviction, just as he has done for decades,\" and called Townshend's voice a \"highlight,\" while still \"rip(ping) power chords and perform(ing) slinky riffs.\"<ref>https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/ct-ent-the-who-who-album-review-20191206-dqqjqxn5wjgbvdrblffskbuuyq-story.html</ref> Gorondi continued his praise by stating that the dominant reasons why the album was \"such a joy\" were due to \"Townshend's songwriting and guitar playing and Daltrey's superlative singing.\"<ref>https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/ct-ent-the-who-who-album-review-20191206-dqqjqxn5wjgbvdrblffskbuuyq-story.html</ref>\n\nConceptually, the album tackles the struggles of being an elderly rock musician, as ''Guardian'' writer, Alexis Petridis noted. \"Townshend seems more troubled than ever,\" Petridis stated, and this feeling overlaps into songs such as \"I Don't Wanna Get Wise,\" which according to Petridis, \"...views a rock career as one of inevitable decline.\"<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/28/the-who-who-review-back-and-still-causing-a-big-sensation</ref> Musically, the album sounds like a \"traditional\" Who record.

It's not a retread, but it sounds like a Who album, which is crucial for something like this, as well as an upgrade for the 21st century.\"<ref>https://ultimateclassicrock.com/the-who-who-album-review/</ref>\n\nDespite the praises for its 1970s rock sound and Daltrey and Townshend's performances, ''WHO'' has received criticism. According to Matthew Taub of ''Consequence of Sound'', some tracks are \"not particularly well conceived,\" citing songs such as \"Detour\" and \"Hero Ground Zero,\" as \"just sit(ting) there\" or \"feeling more like an intermission.\"<ref>https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/11/album-review-the-who-who/</ref> Taub also commented that the track, \"Break the News,\" which was written by Townshend's younger brother, Simon, sounded like it was, \"plucked from some kind of factory for generic acoustic pop songs \u2014 somehow like 100 other songs you\u2019ve heard, yet none you can actually name.\"<ref>https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/11/album-review-the-who-who/</ref> Another complaint was the generational tone of the album. Chris Willman from ''Variety'' stated,\"There are hints of mirth amid the crotchetiness. Right in the opening line, when Daltrey sings \u201cI don\u2019t care, I know you\u2019re gonna hate this song,\u201d followed later by \u201cI don\u2019t mind other guys ripping off my song.\u201d\"<ref>https://variety.com/2019/music/news/the-who-album-review-1203426754/</ref> ''New Musical Express'' journalist, Mark Beaumont, similarly noted this theme with the track, \"I Don't Wanna Get Wise\": \"...(it) almost reads like a 75-year-old Daltrey talking to the drunk and tardy 20-year-old who sang 'My Generation.'\"<ref>https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/the-who-who-review-13-years-since-their-last-album-this-stands-up-alongside-their-classics-2580985</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\nAll songs written by [[Pete Townshend]] except where noted.\n{{Track listing\n| title1 = All This Music Must Fade\n| length1 = 3:20\n| title2 = [[Ball and Chain (The Who song)|Ball and Chain]]\n| length2 = 4:29\n| title3 = I Don't Wanna Get Wise\n| length3 = 3:54\n| title4 = Detour\n| length4 = 3:46\n| title5 = Beads on One String\n| length5 = 3:40\n| note5 = Pete Townshend and Josh Hunsaker\n| title6 = Hero Ground Zero\n| length6 = 4:52\n| title7 = Street Song\n| length7 = 4:47\n| title8 = I'll Be Back\n| length8 = 5:01\n| title9 = Break the News\n| length9 = 4:30\n| note9 = [[Simon Townshend]]\n| title10 = Rockin' in Rage\n| length10 = 4:04\n| title11 = She Rocked My World\n| length11 = 3:22\n}}\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed = no\n| headline = Deluxe edition bonus tracks\n| title12 = This Gun Will Misfire\n| length12 = 3:36\n| title13 = Got Nothing to Prove\n| length13 = 3:38\n| title14 = Danny and My Ponies\n| length14 = 4:02\n| title15 = Sand\n| length15 = 4:27\n| note15 = Demo, Japan only\n}}\n\n==Personnel==\nAdapted from compact disc liner notes and online liner notes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/The-Who-Who/release/14492734|title=The Who - Who|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref>\n===The Who===\n*[[Pete Townshend]]: guitars, backing vocals, lead vocals (tracks 8, 12\u201314), harmonicas, percussion, synthesizer tracks, violin, cello, hurdy-gurdy, effects, orchestration (6)\n*[[Roger Daltrey]]: lead vocals (except 8, 12\u201314)\n\n===Additional personnel===\n*[[Pino Palladino]]: bass (1-2, 4-8, 11-12)\n*[[Zak Starkey]]: drums (1-2, 4, 7)\n*[[Simon Townshend]]: percussion\n*[[Dave Sardy]]: percussion, mellotron, synthesizer programming (5)\n*[[Joey Waronker]]: drums (5, 8, 11-12)\n*[[Benmont Tench]]: organ, mellotron\n*Gus Seyffert: bass (3, 9-10)\n*[[Carla Azar]]: drums (3, 10)\n*[[Matt Chamberlain]]: drums (6)\n*Josh Tyrrell: handclaps (4)\n*Rowan McIntosh: handclaps (4)\n*Martin Batchelar: programming (6), orchestration (6, 8), orchestra arrangement (8), orchestra conducting (6, 8, 13)\n*[[Rachel Fuller]]: orchestration (6)\n*Peter Rotter: orchestra fixer (6, 8, 13)\n*Bruce Dukov: orchestra leader (6, 8, 13)\n*Andrew Synowiec: acoustic guitar (9)\n*[[Gordon Giltrap]]: acoustic guitar (11)\n*Fergus Gerrand: percussion (11)\n\n==Charts==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

{"title_page": "David Divine", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=April 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2015}}\n\n'''Arthur Durham (David) Divine''', CBE, DSM, (1905\u20131987) was a prolific South African writer of books on a variety of subjects but will be chiefly remembered for two controversial books on defence issues, ''The Blunted Sword'' (1964) and ''The Broken Wing'' (1966). Divine had been a war correspondent and after the Second World War became the defence correspondent of the British [[Sunday Times]], a post he held until 1975.\n\n== Early career ==\n\nBorn in [[Cape Town]] on 27 July 1904, the son of Arthur Henry Divine and his wife, Mabel Frances Durham, he was educated at [[Rondebosch Boys' High School]] and [[Kingswood College, Grahamstown]].<ref>Information supplied by family members.</ref>\n\nHe was employed as a journalist on the [[Cape Times]] between 1922\u20131926 and again between 1931\u20131935.\n\nIn 1930 he commenced his career as an author of adventure stories, thrillers, military politics and history books.<ref>[Mr David Divine, Obituary, Times, 2 May 1987, p.72.]</ref> Some were written under the pen name 'David Rame'. His first novel as Rame was ''Wine of Good Hope'' (1939).\n\n== World War II ==\n\n=== Dunkirk ===\n\nDuring the evacuation of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) from [[Dunkirk]] in 1940 ([[Operation Dynamo]]), Divine crossed the English Channel three times in a 35-foot boat to rescue trapped British soldiers. During the last of these he received a stomach wound. For his efforts, Divine was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Medal (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Service Medal]] (DSM).<ref>Obituary, p.72.</ref> The following year he published a novel based on his experience at Dunkirk, ''The Sun Shall Greet Them: A novel based on the Author's experience of the English evacuation at Dunkirk, WW II'' (1941). Divine would write the screenplay for the feature film ''Dunkirk'' (1958) and was the likely inspiration for central character Charles Foreman ([[Bernard Lee]]), skipper of the motorboat ''Vanity''. Like Divine, he is wounded during the operation but Foreman dies from his wounds. ''Nine Days at Dunkirk'' was a factual account of the operation first published in 1945. In this he exposed the legend that the evacuation was carried out by the spontaneous and uncoordinated actions of the little ships when in fact they had been carried out as 'part of a highly organised movement' by the Admiralty. He was also highly critical of General [[Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke|Alan Brooke]]'s (later Lord Alanbrooke) actions preceding the operation but very sympathetic to [[Lord Gort]], commander of the BEF.<ref>\"In Which They Served.\" Times [London, England] 16 April 1959: 15. The Times Digital Archive. Web.</ref>\n\n=== Other theatres ===\n\nAs one of only three war correspondents allowed to travel with the Royal Navy, Divine reported on the war situation in the Mediterranean and in the Atlantic. To be selected as a correspondent aboard a British warship at this time was a considerable achievement in itself as the Royal Navy was suspicious of journalists and refused to allow any aboard at the beginning of the war.<ref>P Knightley, The First Casualty is Truth: The War Correspondent as Hero and Myth-Maker from the Crimea to Kosovo (Prion Books, 2001), p.244.</ref> Many of his observations were incorporated into ''Destroyers\u2019 War: A Million Miles by the Eighth Flotilla'' (1943). He was also present during ''[[Operation Torch]]'' \u2013 the American landings in North Africa in 1943, and travelled over the [[Atlas Mountains]] with the first US troops to fight the German army in the Second World War.  At [[D-Day]] (''[[Operation Overlord]]'') he accompanied the first flotilla of tank landing craft. The final phase of the war was spent with the American Pacific Fleet in the last battles against Japan. Despite his work as a correspondent he still found time to write ''The Sun Shall Greet Them,'' (1941), ''Tunnel from Calais'' (1943), and ''Road to Tunis,'' (1944). After the war, he received the Order of the British Empire ([[OBE]]) in recognition of his service during the conflict.<ref>Obituary, p.72</ref>\n\n== Criticism of British defence ==\nWorking for the ''Sunday Times'' foreign news service under former naval intelligence officer (and later creator of [[James Bond]]), [[Ian Fleming]], Divine travelled widely. He claimed to be the only journalist to charge expenses for an aeroplane and a camel on the same claim form. As newspapers published longer articles and features, Divine made his reputation as the ''Sunday Times'' defence correspondent, where he wrote extensively about Britain's defences in the age of the nuclear missile.<ref>Obituary, p.72</ref> He subjected  Britain's defence establishment to withering fire in ''The Blunted Sword'' (1964) for a lack of imagination and for missing countless opportunities since the Royal Navy began its transition from sail to steam. He was particularly critical of the services' \"fortress mentality\" in fiercely defending their individual vested interests. Divine recommended maximum decentralisation to the commands and a return of the function of weapons production to industry, to competitive development and to new ideas untrammelled by bureaucracy and tradition. This was contrary to the government's efforts to push British aircraft firms and other defence industries into a succession of mergers that would finally become [[British Aerospace plc]] and to create a unified [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MOD). The MOD, he argued, would not resolve the problems of inter-service rivalry as they would merely \"fight in different ways for their separate powers\".<ref>Divine, ''The Blunted Sword'' (Hutchinson, 1964), cover synopsis.</ref> A naval reviewer acknowledged Divine's painstaking factual accuracy but accused him of seeing only one side of the question and failing to properly appreciate the difficulties faced in the past.<ref>RH, \"Review of The Blunted Sword\", ''The Naval Review'', Vol. LII No- 3, 31 July 1964.</ref> Criticism of Divine on the grounds of his lack of objectivity would be unfair, claimed a ''Times'' reviewer, pointing out that his preface made clear it was an attack upon the service administration rather than the services themselves. It was not the sort of book to draw much praise from scholarly historians but was nevertheless \"effective\" with \"something of value to say about Britain's power to influence the policies of the west\".<ref>\"Warriors in Whitehall\", ''Times'', 19 March 1964, p.17.</ref>\n\nDivine produced a wider ranging attack on the air force establishment from World War I up to the mid-1960s in ''The Broken Wing'' (1966). He claimed that all three of the British armed services were slow to appreciate the missile's potential despite the damage inflicted to Britain by Germany's [[V-1 flying bomb|V1]] cruise missiles and [[V-2 rocket|V2]] rockets toward the end of the Second World War. He criticized the RAF for clinging to the manned bomber when the United States was relegating the [[United States Air Force]]'s (USAF) [[Strategic Air Command]]'s (SAC) bomber force to a subsidiary role.<ref>Divine, ''The Broken Wing: A Study in the British Exercise of Air Power'' (Hutchinson, 1966), pp. 9\u201315.</ref> This was because the Soviet air defences had demonstrated their effectiveness against manned aircraft by shooting down the high-altitude [[Lockheed U-2]] spy-plane piloted by [[Gary Powers]] with a surface-to-air guided missile.<ref>Divine, ''Broken Wing'', p.325</ref> The US then unintentionally frustrated the British bomber lobby's plans by cancelling its [[GAM-87 Skybolt]] project\u2013a planned stand-off missile that had just been ordered for the V bomber fleet. The US then concentrated on the development of Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles ([[ICBM]]s).<ref>Divine, ''Broken Wing'', pp. 342\u2013343.</ref> Improvements in Soviet Intermediate Range ([[IRBM]]) and stand-off missiles also indicated that Britain was defenceless against a missile strike during the mid-1960s, because a potential counter-strike against the [[Soviet Union]] with sub-sonic [[V bombers]] seemed doomed to failure given the improvements to the Soviet air defences and the fact that the V bomber bases were themselves vulnerable to IRBM's and stand-off missilery.<ref>Divine, ''Broken Wing'', pp. 317\u2013318</ref> The attempt to prolong the life of the V bomber force by converting the aircraft from high level to low level attack and using a stop-gap stand-off missile was also seen as futile owing to the advances made in the field of Soviet non-radar low-level air defence and the inherent limitations of British equipment originally designed for use at high altitudes. \"Britain stood naked in a missile-armed world\", he wrote.<ref>Divine, ''Broken Wing'', pp. 347, 375\u201376.</ref>\n\n==Other writings==\nBut Divine also wrote on a wide array of subjects. ''The North-West Frontier of Rome'' re-told the story of Hadrian's Wall and a children's book ''The Three Red Flares'' (1970) may have been the first book produced that used computer technology for mass-publishing.<ref>Obituary, p.72.</ref> ''Boy on a Dolphin'' (1955), set in Greece would become a major [[20th Century Fox]] film starring [[Sophia Loren]] and [[Alan Ladd]]. The book tells the romantic story of Phaedra, an island sponge-diver who discovers an ancient statue of a boy riding upon a dolphin. The statue then becomes the object of a struggle between an archaeologist (Ladd) who wants Phaedra (Loren) to sell it to the Greek authorities and a millionaire who desires it for his private collection.<ref>OUR CORRESPONDENT. \"American Film Made in Greece.\" Times [London, England] 27 November 1956: 3. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 7 April 2014.</ref> By coincidence, two years after the novel was released, a 16\" bronze statuette of the goddess [[Artemis]] removing an arrow from her quiver was found near [[Delos]], Divine's original setting. The figure probably dated from pre-Roman [[Hellenistic period|Hellenic]] times.<ref>OUR CORRESPONDENT. \"Fishermen Find Greek Bronze.\" Times [London, England] 1 June 1959: 7. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 7 April 2014</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nDivine wrote over 21 books. His writing on defence issues was a notable influence on Wing Cmdr Hubert Allen's controversial books and articles on British airpower, especially ''Who Won the Battle of Britain'' and ''The Legacy of [[Lord Trenchard]]''. Allen claimed that Divine was the 'notable exception' to the Fleet Street defence correspondents, who 'almost to a man' swallowed the notion of the V bomber's low-level capability.<ref>H R Allen, The Legacy of Lord Trenchard (Cassell, 1972), p.191.</ref> He died on 30 April 1987.\n\n== Sources ==\n\n* H R Allen, The Legacy of Lord Trenchard (Cassell, 1972). {{ISBN|0 304 93702 9}} \n*D Divine, The Blunted Sword (Hutchinson,1964) {{oclc|2699204}}\n* D Divine, The Broken Wing: A Study in the British Exercise of Air Power (Hutchinson, 1966).

He was particularly critical of the services' \"fortress mentality\" in fiercely defending their individual vested interests. Divine recommended maximum decentralisation to the commands and a return of the function of weapons production to industry, to competitive development and to new ideas untrammelled by bureaucracy and tradition. This was contrary to the government's efforts to push British aircraft firms and other defence industries into a succession of mergers that would finally become [[British Aerospace plc]] and to create a unified [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MOD). The MOD, he argued, would not resolve the problems of inter-service rivalry as they would merely \"fight in different ways for their separate powers\".<ref>Divine, ''The Blunted Sword'' (Hutchinson, 1964), cover synopsis.</ref> A naval reviewer acknowledged Divine's painstaking factual accuracy but accused him of seeing only one side of the question and failing to properly appreciate the difficulties faced in the past.<ref>RH, \"Review of The Blunted Sword\", ''The Naval Review'', Vol. LII No- 3, 31 July 1964.</ref> Criticism of Divine on the grounds of his lack of objectivity would be unfair, claimed a ''Times'' reviewer, pointing out that his preface made clear it was an attack upon the service administration rather than the services themselves. It was not the sort of book to draw much praise from scholarly historians but was nevertheless \"effective\" with \"something of value to say about Britain's power to influence the policies of the west\".<ref>\"Warriors in Whitehall\", ''Times'', 19 March 1964, p.17.</ref>\n\nDivine produced a wider ranging attack on the air force establishment from World War I up to the mid-1960s in ''The Broken Wing'' (1966). He claimed that all three of the British armed services were slow to appreciate the missile's potential despite the damage inflicted to Britain by Germany's [[V-1 flying bomb|V1]] cruise missiles and [[V-2 rocket|V2]] rockets toward the end of the Second World War. He criticized the RAF for clinging to the manned bomber when the United States was relegating the [[United States Air Force]]'s (USAF) [[Strategic Air Command]]'s (SAC) bomber force to a subsidiary role.<ref>Divine, ''The Broken Wing: A Study in the British Exercise of Air Power'' (Hutchinson, 1966), pp. 9\u201315.</ref> This was because the Soviet air defences had demonstrated their effectiveness against manned aircraft by shooting down the high-altitude [[Lockheed U-2]] spy-plane piloted by [[Gary Powers]] with a surface-to-air guided missile.<ref>Divine, ''Broken Wing'', p.325</ref> The US then unintentionally frustrated the British bomber lobby's plans by cancelling its [[GAM-87 Skybolt]] project\u2013a planned stand-off missile that had just been ordered for the V bomber fleet. The US then concentrated on the development of Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles ([[ICBM]]s).<ref>Divine, ''Broken Wing'', pp. 342\u2013343.</ref> Improvements in Soviet Intermediate Range ([[IRBM]]) and stand-off missiles also indicated that Britain was defenceless against a missile strike during the mid-1960s, because a potential counter-strike against the [[Soviet Union]] with sub-sonic [[V bombers]] seemed doomed to failure given the improvements to the Soviet air defences and the fact that the V bomber bases were themselves vulnerable to IRBM's and stand-off missilery.<ref>Divine, ''Broken Wing'', pp. 317\u2013318</ref> The attempt to prolong the life of the V bomber force by converting the aircraft from high level to low level attack and using a stop-gap stand-off missile was also seen as futile owing to the advances made in the field of Soviet non-radar low-level air defence and the inherent limitations of British equipment originally designed for use at high altitudes. \"Britain stood naked in a missile-armed world\", he wrote.<ref>Divine, ''Broken Wing'', pp. 347, 375\u201376.</ref>\n\n==Other writings==\nBut Divine also wrote on a wide array of subjects. ''The North-West Frontier of Rome'' re-told the story of Hadrian's Wall and a children's book ''The Three Red Flares'' (1970) may have been the first book produced that used computer technology for mass-publishing.<ref>Obituary, p.72.</ref> ''Boy on a Dolphin'' (1955), set in Greece would become a major [[20th Century Fox]] film starring [[Sophia Loren]] and [[Alan Ladd]]. The book tells the romantic story of Phaedra, an island sponge-diver who discovers an ancient statue of a boy riding upon a dolphin. The statue then becomes the object of a struggle between an archaeologist (Ladd) who wants Phaedra (Loren) to sell it to the Greek authorities and a millionaire who desires it for his private collection.<ref>OUR CORRESPONDENT. \"American Film Made in Greece.\" Times [London, England] 27 November 1956: 3. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 7 April 2014.</ref> By coincidence, two years after the novel was released, a 16\" bronze statuette of the goddess [[Artemis]] removing an arrow from her quiver was found near [[Delos]], Divine's original setting. The figure probably dated from pre-Roman [[Hellenistic period|Hellenic]] times.<ref>OUR CORRESPONDENT. \"Fishermen Find Greek Bronze.\" Times [London, England] 1 June 1959: 7. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 7 April 2014</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nDivine wrote over 21 books. His writing on defence issues was a notable influence on Wing Cmdr Hubert Allen's controversial books and articles on British airpower, especially ''Who Won the Battle of Britain'' and ''The Legacy of [[Lord Trenchard]]''. Allen claimed that Divine was the 'notable exception' to the Fleet Street defence correspondents, who 'almost to a man' swallowed the notion of the V bomber's low-level capability.<ref>H R Allen, The Legacy of Lord Trenchard (Cassell, 1972), p.191.</ref> He died on 30 April 1987.\n\n== Sources ==\n\n* H R Allen, The Legacy of Lord Trenchard (Cassell, 1972). {{ISBN|0 304 93702 9}} \n*D Divine, The Blunted Sword (Hutchinson,1964) {{oclc|2699204}}\n* D Divine, The Broken Wing: A Study in the British Exercise of Air Power (Hutchinson, 1966).
