The title of \"[[List of tallest buildings|world's tallest building]]\" has been borne by various buildings, such as the [[Rouen Cathedral]] and the [[Empire State Building]].\n\nThe [[skyscraper]] was invented in [[Chicago]] in 1884 when the [[Home Insurance Building]] was constructed using a [[steel-frame]] with [[Curtain wall (architecture)|curtain walls]] instead of [[load-bearing wall]]s. For the next hundred years, the world's tallest building was always in the United States with [[New York City]] accumulating 86 years, and Chicago accumulating 30 years. After just over a century (1885\u20131998), the distinction moved to the Eastern Hemisphere. [[Malaysia]] was the first country to break the United States' record of constructing the tallest buildings in the world when the [[Petronas Twin Towers]] were completed in 1998. [[Taiwan]]'s [[Taipei 101]] was the next building to hold the record, beginning in 2004.\n\nAfter the modern skyscraper era, there was the ancient Greek Necromation. many Christian churches and cathedrals, built mainly in England and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] territories between {{circa}} 1250\u20131894, comprised the tallest buildings in the world. Before the 13th century, the tallest buildings in the world cannot be conclusively determined. For instance, the [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]] (completed about 280 BC) has been estimated to be {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall,<ref>{{cite book|first=Peter A.|last= Clayton|chapter=Chapter 7: The Pharos at Alexandria|title=The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UU2AAAAAQBAJ|editor1=Peter A. Clayton|editor2=Martin J. Price|location=London|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=9781135629281|page=147}}</ref> but its true height is not known. For thousands of years, the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]] in [[Egypt]] was the tallest ''structure'' in the world, but the Great Pyramid is not considered a building since it is not habitable. Similarly, the Eiffel Tower was the world tallest structure from 1889, when it was built, until 1930,  when the Chrysler building was built. <ref name=ParisDigest>{{Cite web |url= https://www.parisdigest.com/paris/paris-facts.htm|title= Paris facts|author= | year=2019 |publisher=Paris Digest |accessdate=2019-09-04}}</ref>\n\n==Definition of terms==\n[[File:Tallest buildings in the world.png|thumb|right|450px|The tallest buildings in 2015]]\n===Meaning of \"building\"===\nThe earliest structures now known to be the tallest in the world were the [[Egyptian pyramids]], with the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]], at an original height of {{convert|146.5|m}}, being the tallest man-made structure in the world for over 3,800 years, until the construction of [[Lincoln Cathedral]] in 1311. From then until the completion of the [[Washington Monument]] (capped in 1884) the world's tallest buildings were churches or cathedrals. Later, the [[Eiffel Tower]] and, still later, some radio masts and television towers were the world's tallest structures.\n\nHowever, though all of these are ''structures'', some are not ''[[building]]s'' in the sense of being regularly inhabited or occupied. It is in this sense of being regularly inhabited or occupied that the term \"building\" is generally understood to mean when determining what is the world's tallest building. The non-profit international organization [[Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat]] (CTBUH), which maintains a set of criteria for determining the height of tall buildings, defines a \"building\" as \"(A) structure that is designed for residential, business or manufacturing purposes\" and \"has floors\".<ref name=CTBUH_criteria>{{cite web |url=http://www.ctbuh.org/AboutCTBUH/History/MeasuringTall/tabid/1320/language/en-GB/Default.aspx |title=Height: The History of Measuring Tall Buildings |author=Marshall Gerometta |date= |work=Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat |accessdate=March 29, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129084123/http://www.ctbuh.org/AboutCTBUH/History/MeasuringTall/tabid/1320/language/en-GB/Default.aspx |archive-date=29 January 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nTall churches and cathedrals occupy a middle ground: their lower areas are regularly occupied, but much of their height is in bell towers and spires which are not. Whether a church or cathedral is a \"building\" or merely a \"structure\" for the purposes of determining the title of \"world's tallest building\" is a subjective matter of definition (this article treats churches and cathedrals as buildings).\n\n===Determination of height===\nThe Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat based in [[Chicago]] uses three different criteria for determining the height of a tall building, each of which may give a different result. \"Height of the highest floor\" is one criterion, and \"height to the top of any part of the building\" is another, but the default criterion used by the CTBUH is  \"height of the architectural top of the building\", which includes spires but not antennae, masts or flag poles.<ref name=CTBUH_criteria />\n\n==Tallest buildings (7th to 12th century)==\n[[Hwangnyongsa]], or Hwangnyong Temple (also spelled Hwangryongsa) is the name of a former [[Buddhist temple]] in the city of [[Gyeongju]], [[South Korea]]. Completed in the 7th century, the enormous 9-storey structure was built entirely with wood with interlocking design with no iron nails.

[[Old St Paul's Cathedral]] with its spire was completed in the 13th century. The central spire of [[Lincoln Cathedral]] surpassed Old St Paul's in the early 14th century. The Lincoln Cathedral's spire collapsed in 1549, beginning a long interval where the status of world's tallest building was borne by shorter buildings. [[St. Mary's Church, Stralsund|St. Mary's Church]] in [[Stralsund]] became the world's tallest building after the collapse of Lincoln Cathedral's spire.

Other criteria would generate a different list. [[Shanghai World Financial Center]] is not on the above list, but it surpassed Taipei 101 in 2008 to become the building with the highest occupied floor. Using the criteria of highest tip (including antennae), the World Trade Center in New York City was the world's tallest building from 1972 to 2000, until the Sears Tower in Chicago (which already had a higher occupied floor than the World Trade Center) had its antenna extended to give that building the world's tallest tip; a title it held until the 2010 completion of Burj Khalifa. Petronas Towers and Taipei 101 were never the world's tallest buildings by the highest\u2013tip criteria.\n\nSince 2010, Burj Khalifa has been the tallest building by any criteria.

There are currently sixty buildings in the world's 100 tallest that are located in Asia (including  the Middle East).\n\n== Increment in usage of skyscrapers ==\nSince the skyscraper era began, the great majority of skyscrapers were used predominantly as office space. From 1930 to 2000, the percentage of office towers never fell below 86 percent, but in the future it is expected to be as low as 46 percent.<ref name=\"ct208\"/> By 2010, less than half of the 100 tallest buildings in the world were office towers with the majority utilized as [[residential]] and mixed use.<ref name=\"ct208\"/> Only four of the ten tallest buildings in the world, and twenty eight of the fifty tallest in the world, were used primarily as offices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctbuh.org/Portals/0/Tallest/CTBUH_TallestOffice.pdf |title=Tallest single-function office buildings in the world (as of December 2009) |website=ctbuh.org |publisher=Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat |date=December 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5nTtIeBpj?url=http://www.ctbuh.org/Portals/0/Tallest/CTBUH_TallestOffice.pdf |archivedate=February 12, 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nA mixed-use tall building contains two or more functions (uses), where each of the functions occupies a significant proportion of the tower's total space.{{ref label|note01|A|^}} Support areas such as car parks and mechanical plant space do not contribute towards mixed-use status.<ref name=\"ct446\"/>\n\nSkyscrapers used primarily or exclusively as hotels or residential space are generally shorter than office and mixed-use buildings, with only a few supertall buildings of the residential or hotel types among the 100 tallest skyscrapers.

The title of \"[[List of tallest buildings|world's tallest building]]\" has been borne by various buildings, such as the [[Rouen Cathedral]] and the [[Empire State Building]].\n\nThe [[skyscraper]] was invented in [[Chicago]] in 1884 when the [[Home Insurance Building]] was constructed using a [[steel-frame]] with [[Curtain wall (architecture)|curtain walls]] instead of [[load-bearing wall]]s. For the next hundred years, the world's tallest building was always in the United States with [[New York City]] accumulating 86 years, and Chicago accumulating 30 years. After just over a century (1885\u20131998), the distinction moved to the Eastern Hemisphere. [[Malaysia]] was the first country to break the United States' record of constructing the tallest buildings in the world when the [[Petronas Twin Towers]] were completed in 1998. [[Taiwan]]'s [[Taipei 101]] was the next building to hold the record, beginning in 2004.\n\nBefore the modern skyscraper era, many Christian churches and cathedrals, built mainly in England and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] territories between {{circa}} 1250\u20131894, comprised the tallest buildings in the world. Before the 13th century, the tallest buildings in the world cannot be conclusively determined.

For thousands of years, the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]] in [[Egypt]] was the tallest ''structure'' in the world, but the Great Pyramid is not considered a building since it is not habitable. Similarly, the Eiffel Tower was the world tallest structure from 1889, when it was built, until 1930,  when the Chrysler building was built. <ref name=ParisDigest>{{Cite web |url= https://www.parisdigest.com/paris/paris-facts.htm|title= Paris facts|author= | year=2019 |publisher=Paris Digest |accessdate=2019-09-04}}</ref>\n\n==Definition of terms==\n[[File:Tallest buildings in the world.png|thumb|right|450px|The tallest buildings in 2015]]\n===Meaning of \"building\"===\nThe earliest structures now known to be the tallest in the world were the [[Egyptian pyramids]], with the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]], at an original height of {{convert|146.5|m}}, being the tallest man-made structure in the world for over 3,800 years, until the construction of [[Lincoln Cathedral]] in 1311. From then until the completion of the [[Washington Monument]] (capped in 1884) the world's tallest buildings were churches or cathedrals. Later, the [[Eiffel Tower]] and, still later, some radio masts and television towers were the world's tallest structures.\n\nHowever, though all of these are ''structures'', some are not ''[[building]]s'' in the sense of being regularly inhabited or occupied. It is in this sense of being regularly inhabited or occupied that the term \"building\" is generally understood to mean when determining what is the world's tallest building. The non-profit international organization [[Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat]] (CTBUH), which maintains a set of criteria for determining the height of tall buildings, defines a \"building\" as \"(A) structure that is designed for residential, business or manufacturing purposes\" and \"has floors\".<ref name=CTBUH_criteria>{{cite web |url=http://www.ctbuh.org/AboutCTBUH/History/MeasuringTall/tabid/1320/language/en-GB/Default.aspx |title=Height: The History of Measuring Tall Buildings |author=Marshall Gerometta |date= |work=Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat |accessdate=March 29, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129084123/http://www.ctbuh.org/AboutCTBUH/History/MeasuringTall/tabid/1320/language/en-GB/Default.aspx |archive-date=29 January 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nTall churches and cathedrals occupy a middle ground: their lower areas are regularly occupied, but much of their height is in bell towers and spires which are not. Whether a church or cathedral is a \"building\" or merely a \"structure\" for the purposes of determining the title of \"world's tallest building\" is a subjective matter of definition (this article treats churches and cathedrals as buildings).\n\n===Determination of height===\nThe Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat based in [[Chicago]] uses three different criteria for determining the height of a tall building, each of which may give a different result. \"Height of the highest floor\" is one criterion, and \"height to the top of any part of the building\" is another, but the default criterion used by the CTBUH is  \"height of the architectural top of the building\", which includes spires but not antennae, masts or flag poles.<ref name=CTBUH_criteria />\n\n==Tallest buildings (7th to 12th century)==\n[[Hwangnyongsa]], or Hwangnyong Temple (also spelled Hwangryongsa) is the name of a former [[Buddhist temple]] in the city of [[Gyeongju]], [[South Korea]].

The Lincoln Cathedral's spire collapsed in 1549, beginning a long interval where the status of world's tallest building was borne by shorter buildings. [[St. Mary's Church, Stralsund|St. Mary's Church]] in [[Stralsund]] became the world's tallest building after the collapse of Lincoln Cathedral's spire. The {{convert|153|m|ft|abbr=on}} central tower of [[Beauvais Cathedral|St. Pierre's Cathedral]] in Beauvais was tallest from 1569 until it collapsed in 1573, making St. Mary's the tallest once again.

Other criteria would generate a different list. [[Shanghai World Financial Center]] is not on the above list, but it surpassed Taipei 101 in 2008 to become the building with the highest occupied floor. Using the criteria of highest tip (including antennae), the World Trade Center in New York City was the world's tallest building from 1972 to 2000, until the Sears Tower in Chicago (which already had a higher occupied floor than the World Trade Center) had its antenna extended to give that building the world's tallest tip; a title it held until the 2010 completion of Burj Khalifa. Petronas Towers and Taipei 101 were never the world's tallest buildings by the highest\u2013tip criteria.\n\nSince 2010, Burj Khalifa has been the tallest building by any criteria.

In the future, this percentage is expected to decline to only 22 percent.<ref name=\"ct208\"/> The predominance of skyscrapers in North America is decreasing due to skyscraper construction in other parts of the world, especially in [[Asia]].\n\nIn Asia, there has been an increase in the number of supertall skyscrapers beginning with the construction of [[Petronas Twin Towers]]. There are currently sixty buildings in the world's 100 tallest that are located in Asia (including  the Middle East).\n\n== Increment in usage of skyscrapers ==\nSince the skyscraper era began, the great majority of skyscrapers were used predominantly as office space.
