Dependent variables represent the [[wikt:Special:Search/output|output]] or outcome resulting from altering these inputs. \n\nOf the two, it is always the dependent variable whose [[wikt:variation|variation]] is being studied, by altering inputs, also known as '''regressors''' in a [[statistics|statistical]] context.

She sailed from the builders on the River Tyne in November 1994.

One of the most interesting visits she made was to the [[Russia]]n port of [[Vladivostok]], an important Russian naval base, where she became the first Royal Navy vessel to visit in over 100 years. Also that year ''Richmond'' escorted the [[royal yacht]] {{ship|HMY|Britannia}} on the ship's final leg of her final tour of the United Kingdom prior to her decommissioning.\n\nIn 1998 ''Richmond'' participated in two significant [[NATO]] naval exercises and arrived in [[New York City|New York]] where she was involved in the US Navy Fleet Week. In 1999 ''Richmond'' was dispatched to the South Atlantic as part of [[Atlantic Patrol Task (South)]] and underwent a major overhaul which concluded in 2000.\n\n===2001\u20132010===\nIn 2001 ''Richmond'' joined the NATO multi-national squadron [[Standing Naval Force Mediterranean]]. In 2002 she arrived in the Caribbean where she performed tasks including obligatory \"fly-the-flag\" duties to the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries in the region as well as undergoing trials. In June 2002, two officers were killed when ''Richmond''{{'}}s [[HMS Richmond helicopter crash|Lynx helicopter crashed]] off the coast of Virginia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2046318.stm |title=Navy investigators head for crash scene |date=15 June 2002 |website=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=31 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, under the command of Commander [[Wayne Keble]], she deployed to the [[Persian Gulf]] on [[Armilla Patrol]] where she relieved {{HMS|Cardiff|D108|6}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royal-navy.mod.uk/server/show/conWebDoc.3706/changeNav/3533 |title=News and Events |website=Royal Navy |accessdate=4 March 2008}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> She had arrived shortly before the [[2003 Iraq War]]. When hostilities began, ''Richmond'', HM ships {{HMS|Chatham|F87|2}}, {{HMS|Marlborough|F233|2}} and {{HMAS|Anzac|FFH 150|6}} of the [[Royal Australian Navy]] provided Naval Gunfire Support (NGS) during the [[Royal Marines]]' [[2003 invasion of Iraq#Opening attack|amphibious assault of the Al Faw Peninsula]], the first amphibious assault by the Marines since the [[Falklands War]] in 1982. ''Richmond'' remained in the region at the war's end and returned home in August.\n\nIn July 2004, under the command of Commander [[Mike McCartain]], ''Richmond'' deployed on [[Atlantic Patrol Task (North)]], which encompasses the Atlantic and [[Caribbean]] regions. Two of the ports she visited early in the deployment were [[Jamaica]] and [[Belize]]. In September ''Richmond'' came to the assistance of the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]] when they were struck by [[Hurricane Frances]].  Turks and Caicos suffered only minimal damage to buildings. ''Richmond'' then sailed to [[Cura\u00e7ao]], [[Netherlands Antilles]] where she resumed her maintenance period, which had been interrupted due to the hurricane, but remained on standby to provide assistance due to the imminent arrival of [[Hurricane Ivan]].\n\nHurricane Ivan eventually hit the region, causing significant damage and fatalities, particularly inflicting enormous damage and a number of fatalities to [[Grenada]], which included immense damage to the capital [[St. George's, Grenada|St. George's]]. ''Richmond'' and her accompanying [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]] vessel {{ship|RFA|Wave Ruler|A390|2}} came to the assistance of the island. The extent of the damage in Grenada reached such levels that [[Keith Mitchell]], Prime Minister of Grenada, was forced to relocate to ''Richmond'' after his residence was destroyed by the hurricane. The Prime Minister effectively ran his country from ''Richmond'' for several hours.\n\nHer crew having performed vital assistance on land at Grenada, ''Richmond'' steamed at her top speed for Jamaica and the Cayman Islands to assist those territories in recovering from the ravages of Hurricane Ivan.\n\n''Richmond'' returned from her deployment in December 2004, and began a refit period at [[HMNB Portsmouth|HM Naval Base Portsmouth]] in mid-2005. The refit, undertaken by [[Fleet Support Limited]], was completed in late 2006 and ''Richmond'' was returned to the operational fleet in October 2006. With 44 major upgrades to her sensor and weapon systems, ''Richmond'' was at that time one of the most capable Type 23 frigates.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.fleet-support.co.uk/Docs/FirstBase/firstbase-winter2006.pdf |title=Fresh-faced ''Richmond'' re-dedicated to the Fleet |date=December 2006 |magazine=firstBASE |page=7 |publisher=[[HMNB Portsmouth]] |access-date=3 January 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809192438/http://www.fleet-support.co.uk/Docs/FirstBase/firstbase-winter2006.pdf |archive-date=9 August 2007}}</ref> From 5 to 12 July 2010 she anchored beside {{HMS|Belfast||6}} in London to foster the ship's relations with the [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames|Borough of Richmond-upon-Thames]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/4659 |title=HMS ''Richmond'' arrives in the Pool of London |date=5 July 2010 |website=London SE1 |accessdate=5 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===2011\u2013present===\n[[File:HMS Richmond at South Quay.jpg|thumb|left|HMS ''Richmond'' moored at South Quay in London in 2017]]\nIn 2011, she deployed to the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region, the latter for upcoming [[Five Power Defence Arrangement]] exercises, specifically Exercise Bersama Shield 11.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.navynews.co.uk/news/1215-richmond-enjoys-some-happy-torque-in-the-far-east.aspx |title=''Richmond'' enjoys some happy torque in the Far East |newspaper=[[Navy News]]}} {{dead link|date=October 2016}}</ref> She assisted with anti-piracy operations with the EU Naval Force and was also a participant in the IMEX Asia 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/MilitaryOperations/HmsRichmondDeploysOnCounterpiracyMission.htm |author=Ministry of Defence |title=HMS ''Richmond'' deploys on counter-piracy mission  |date=5 January 2011 |website=[[Gov.uk]] |accessdate=5 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cornwallcommunitynews.co.uk/2011/05/10/navy-take-on-pirates-real-ones/ |title=Navy Takes On Pirates (Real Ones) |date=10 May 2011 |website=Cornwall Community News |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513134031/http://www.cornwallcommunitynews.co.uk/2011/05/10/navy-take-on-pirates-real-ones/ |archive-date=13 May 2011}}</ref> After Singapore, she rendered honours to the fallen of [[Force Z]] (see the [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|Sinking of ''Prince of Wales'' and ''Repulse'']]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.navynews.co.uk/news/1203-richmond-honours-the-dead-of-force-z.aspx |title=''Richmond'' honours the dead of Force Z |newspaper=Navy News}} {{dead link|date=October 2016}}</ref>\n\nShe took part in exercise FRUKUS 2011 with ships from the [[United States Navy]] and [[Russian Navy]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://english.ruvr.ru/2011/06/01/51118143.html |title=Russian warship heads out for joint maneuvers |date=1 June 2011 |website=[[Sputnik (news agency)|Sputnik]] |access-date=1 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120906022428/http://english.ruvr.ru/2011/06/01/51118143.html |archive-date=6 September 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn early August 2013, she deployed under the command of Commander Robert G.

She was launched on 6 April 1993 by Lady Hill-Norton, wife of the late [[Peter Hill-Norton, Baron Hill-Norton|Admiral of the Fleet The Lord Hill-Norton]], and was the last warship to be built by [[Swan Hunter Shipbuilders]]. She sailed from the builders on the River Tyne in November 1994. She is named for the [[Duke of Richmond|Dukedom of Richmond]].\n\n==Operational history==\n===1995\u20132000===\n[[File:HMS Richmond.jpg|thumb|left|HMS ''Richmond'' in Portsmouth Naval Base]]\n[[File:US Navy 020612-N-9407M-518 British frigate HMS Richmond (F-239) launches an AGM-84A \"Harpoon\" missile.jpg|thumb|left|''Richmond'' launching an [[Boeing Harpoon|AGM-84 Harpoon]] missile]]\n[[File:US Navy 090326-N-4774B-125 The Royal Navy frigate HMS Richmond (F 239) patrols the waters surrounding the Al Basra Oil Terminal off the coast of Iraq while merchant vessels wait to take on oil.jpg|thumb|left|''Richmond'' patrolling near the [[Al Basrah Oil Terminal|Al Basra Oil Terminal]], Iraq]]\n''Richmond'' was first deployed in 1997 to the [[Far East]] as part of the 'Ocean Wave 97' Task Group. One of the most interesting visits she made was to the [[Russia]]n port of [[Vladivostok]], an important Russian naval base, where she became the first Royal Navy vessel to visit in over 100 years. Also that year ''Richmond'' escorted the [[royal yacht]] {{ship|HMY|Britannia}} on the ship's final leg of her final tour of the United Kingdom prior to her decommissioning.\n\nIn 1998 ''Richmond'' participated in two significant [[NATO]] naval exercises and arrived in [[New York City|New York]] where she was involved in the US Navy Fleet Week. In 1999 ''Richmond'' was dispatched to the South Atlantic as part of [[Atlantic Patrol Task (South)]] and underwent a major overhaul which concluded in 2000.\n\n===2001\u20132010===\nIn 2001 ''Richmond'' joined the NATO multi-national squadron [[Standing Naval Force Mediterranean]]. In 2002 she arrived in the Caribbean where she performed tasks including obligatory \"fly-the-flag\" duties to the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries in the region as well as undergoing trials. In June 2002, two officers were killed when ''Richmond''{{'}}s [[HMS Richmond helicopter crash|Lynx helicopter crashed]] off the coast of Virginia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2046318.stm |title=Navy investigators head for crash scene |date=15 June 2002 |website=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=31 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, under the command of Commander [[Wayne Keble]], she deployed to the [[Persian Gulf]] on [[Armilla Patrol]] where she relieved {{HMS|Cardiff|D108|6}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royal-navy.mod.uk/server/show/conWebDoc.3706/changeNav/3533 |title=News and Events |website=Royal Navy |accessdate=4 March 2008}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> She had arrived shortly before the [[2003 Iraq War]]. When hostilities began, ''Richmond'', HM ships {{HMS|Chatham|F87|2}}, {{HMS|Marlborough|F233|2}} and {{HMAS|Anzac|FFH 150|6}} of the [[Royal Australian Navy]] provided Naval Gunfire Support (NGS) during the [[Royal Marines]]' [[2003 invasion of Iraq#Opening attack|amphibious assault of the Al Faw Peninsula]], the first amphibious assault by the Marines since the [[Falklands War]] in 1982. ''Richmond'' remained in the region at the war's end and returned home in August.\n\nIn July 2004, under the command of Commander [[Mike McCartain]], ''Richmond'' deployed on [[Atlantic Patrol Task (North)]], which encompasses the Atlantic and [[Caribbean]] regions. Two of the ports she visited early in the deployment were [[Jamaica]] and [[Belize]]. In September ''Richmond'' came to the assistance of the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]] when they were struck by [[Hurricane Frances]].  Turks and Caicos suffered only minimal damage to buildings. ''Richmond'' then sailed to [[Cura\u00e7ao]], [[Netherlands Antilles]] where she resumed her maintenance period, which had been interrupted due to the hurricane, but remained on standby to provide assistance due to the imminent arrival of [[Hurricane Ivan]].\n\nHurricane Ivan eventually hit the region, causing significant damage and fatalities, particularly inflicting enormous damage and a number of fatalities to [[Grenada]], which included immense damage to the capital [[St. George's, Grenada|St. George's]]. ''Richmond'' and her accompanying [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]] vessel {{ship|RFA|Wave Ruler|A390|2}} came to the assistance of the island. The extent of the damage in Grenada reached such levels that [[Keith Mitchell]], Prime Minister of Grenada, was forced to relocate to ''Richmond'' after his residence was destroyed by the hurricane. The Prime Minister effectively ran his country from ''Richmond'' for several hours.\n\nHer crew having performed vital assistance on land at Grenada, ''Richmond'' steamed at her top speed for Jamaica and the Cayman Islands to assist those territories in recovering from the ravages of Hurricane Ivan.\n\n''Richmond'' returned from her deployment in December 2004, and began a refit period at [[HMNB Portsmouth|HM Naval Base Portsmouth]] in mid-2005. The refit, undertaken by [[Fleet Support Limited]], was completed in late 2006 and ''Richmond'' was returned to the operational fleet in October 2006. With 44 major upgrades to her sensor and weapon systems, ''Richmond'' was at that time one of the most capable Type 23 frigates.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.fleet-support.co.uk/Docs/FirstBase/firstbase-winter2006.pdf |title=Fresh-faced ''Richmond'' re-dedicated to the Fleet |date=December 2006 |magazine=firstBASE |page=7 |publisher=[[HMNB Portsmouth]] |access-date=3 January 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809192438/http://www.fleet-support.co.uk/Docs/FirstBase/firstbase-winter2006.pdf |archive-date=9 August 2007}}</ref> From 5 to 12 July 2010 she anchored beside {{HMS|Belfast||6}} in London to foster the ship's relations with the [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames|Borough of Richmond-upon-Thames]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/4659 |title=HMS ''Richmond'' arrives in the Pool of London |date=5 July 2010 |website=London SE1 |accessdate=5 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===2011\u2013present===\n[[File:HMS Richmond at South Quay.jpg|thumb|left|HMS ''Richmond'' moored at South Quay in London in 2017]]\nIn 2011, she deployed to the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region, the latter for upcoming [[Five Power Defence Arrangement]] exercises, specifically Exercise Bersama Shield 11.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.navynews.co.uk/news/1215-richmond-enjoys-some-happy-torque-in-the-far-east.aspx |title=''Richmond'' enjoys some happy torque in the Far East |newspaper=[[Navy News]]}} {{dead link|date=October 2016}}</ref> She assisted with anti-piracy operations with the EU Naval Force and was also a participant in the IMEX Asia 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/MilitaryOperations/HmsRichmondDeploysOnCounterpiracyMission.htm |author=Ministry of Defence |title=HMS ''Richmond'' deploys on counter-piracy mission  |date=5 January 2011 |website=[[Gov.uk]] |accessdate=5 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cornwallcommunitynews.co.uk/2011/05/10/navy-take-on-pirates-real-ones/ |title=Navy Takes On Pirates (Real Ones) |date=10 May 2011 |website=Cornwall Community News |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513134031/http://www.cornwallcommunitynews.co.uk/2011/05/10/navy-take-on-pirates-real-ones/ |archive-date=13 May 2011}}</ref> After Singapore, she rendered honours to the fallen of [[Force Z]] (see the [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|Sinking of ''Prince of Wales'' and ''Repulse'']]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.navynews.co.uk/news/1203-richmond-honours-the-dead-of-force-z.aspx |title=''Richmond'' honours the dead of Force Z |newspaper=Navy News}} {{dead link|date=October 2016}}</ref>\n\nShe took part in exercise FRUKUS 2011 with ships from the [[United States Navy]] and [[Russian Navy]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://english.ruvr.ru/2011/06/01/51118143.html |title=Russian warship heads out for joint maneuvers |date=1 June 2011 |website=[[Sputnik (news agency)|Sputnik]] |access-date=1 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120906022428/http://english.ruvr.ru/2011/06/01/51118143.html |archive-date=6 September 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn early August 2013, she deployed under the command of Commander Robert G.
