Founded by English boatbuilder and sailor [[Jeremy Rogers]] in 1961, it is currently known for construction to order of the classic [[Contessa 32]] design, and refurbishment of Contessa and other yachts. The yard is notable for the high quality handbuilding of the yachts, and the renownd [[seaworthiness]] of the designs compared to modern mass-production yards.\n\n==History==\n\nThe business was founded by Rogers in 1961, and by the early 1980s was employing 200 people in five factories in Lymington building the [[Contessa 26]], [[Contessa 32]] and the Doug Peterson designed Grand Prix 35s, 39s and 43s, and exporting the yachts worldwide.

''Sunday in Warsaw''; carefree people move through a square with ruins of feudal mansions. Paris: ''Existentialism'': an idyll of today, ''Flea Market'': a still life with humourous originality. ''New York'': A very dynamic Harlem; a painter paints \"Bohemia in Greenwich Village\" on the public pavement. Like a relic of the last century, an elderly couple walks through the colonial suburbs, elegantly dressed. Two Austrian Jews, thin and weak, wander aimlessly after years of concentration camp. In front of the Cathedral of Bamberg, two women who have seen better times, chatter animatedly. ''Displaced'': A group of sorrowful photos for which there are no words to describe such misery; children crying, old women holding out their hands, a woman searching unsuccessfully for her granddaughter. Beings without hope or future. The [[Oktoberfest]] in [[Munich|M\u00fcnich]], with its overflowing joy, serves as a counterpoint. Imposing vistas of the Acropolis of Athens.

They released several self-recorded demos under that name, before discovering the Canadian band [[Anvil (band)|Anvil]] who had already released an album internationally, \n\nIn response to this, the band changed their name to \u201cAxis\u201d.

Which they submitted to EMI records several times, and were eventually signed to EMI Electrola. Due to an EMI subsidiary in Germany also named Axis, the band introduced a second X in their name, becoming \u201cAxxis\u201d.

It originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on October 10, 2010. The episode follows [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] after he discovers his father-in-law, [[Carter Pewterschmidt]], having an affair with another woman. Deciding to blackmail him, Peter begins taking advantage of his father-in-law's enormous wealth, before accidentally spilling the beans to Carter's wife, Barbara, who divorces him soon after. Peter then becomes Carter's [[Wingman (social)|wingman]], and helps him in rediscovering his bachelorhood, as he begins navigating through the dating scene.\n\nThe episode was written by [[Wellesley Wild]] and directed by [[Cyndi Tang|Cyndi Tang-Loveland]]. It received mixed reviews from critics for its storyline and many cultural references. According to [[Nielsen ratings]], it was viewed in 7.02 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by [[Max Burkholder]], [[Christine Lakin]] and [[Rachael MacFarlane]], along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. \"Welcome Back, Carter\" was released on [[DVD]] along with three other episodes from the season on December 13, 2011.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter deciding to visit her parents, [[Carter Pewterschmidt|Carter]] and [[Barbara Pewterschmidt]], [[Lois Griffin|Lois]], along with her husband, [[Peter Griffin|Peter]], discover an old photo album showcasing Barbara and Carter's love for each other, as well as Barbara's short-lived affair during the \"Great War with Alaska\", during which, after returning home from combat, Carter reclaims his wife, and the two's love is shown to have lasted ever since. Becoming bored, Peter decides to call his father-in-law to dinner, and soon discovers Carter in his yacht, having sex with a dark-haired Asian woman. Questioning his father-in-law's judgment, he eventually promises to keep the affair a secret from Barbara. The next day, at the Drunken Clam, Peter begins discussing the affair with [[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]] and [[Joe Swanson|Joe]], who suggest Peter blackmail Carter as revenge for his constant mistreatment.\n\nVisiting his wife's parents during the middle of the night, Peter informs Carter that he is now his personal slave, and must perform any task he wishes, including having a limousine joust and writing witty catchphrases. Noticing Peter and Carter spending time together, Barbara and Lois soon witness the two taking a high-definition television out of the house. But while they are doing this, Peter accidentally spills the beans to Barbara about the affair, and Barbera is instantly devastated by this and runs of the room sobbing.\nEnraged, \nCarter announces that he and Barbara are getting a divorce, causing Peter to suggest he meet other people. Taking him to the local club, Peter introduces Carter to the dating scene, where he soon meets Paula, an attractive blonde. Going on to demand an [[African American]] patron fetch him a drink, Carter is accused of being a racist by Paula, who leaves him. Continuing to desire Barbara, Carter decides to take a bouquet of roses to his former wife. While there, he discovers that Barbara has begun dating the man she had an affair with during the war (who sings to her in the tune of 'The Miners Mother'). Announcing he has something important to say to Barbara, Carter confesses his love for her, and apologizes. Barbara then allows Carter to earn her trust by letting him move back in, and the two ultimately embrace in a passionate kiss. <!--The genie lamp is not a part of the plot. Do not add it.

It originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on October 10, 2010. The episode follows [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] after he discovers his father-in-law, [[Carter Pewterschmidt]], having an affair with another woman. Deciding to blackmail him, Peter begins taking advantage of his father-in-law's enormous wealth, before accidentally spilling the beans to Carter's wife, Barbara, who divorces him soon after. Peter then becomes Carter's [[Wingman (social)|wingman]], and helps him in rediscovering his bachelorhood, as he begins navigating through the dating scene.\n\nThe episode was written by [[Wellesley Wild]] and directed by [[Cyndi Tang|Cyndi Tang-Loveland]]. It received mixed reviews from critics for its storyline and many cultural references. According to [[Nielsen ratings]], it was viewed in 7.02 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by [[Max Burkholder]], [[Christine Lakin]] and [[Rachael MacFarlane]], along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. \"Welcome Back, Carter\" was released on [[DVD]] along with three other episodes from the season on December 13, 2011.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter deciding to visit her parents, [[Carter Pewterschmidt|Carter]] and [[Barbara Pewterschmidt]], [[Lois Griffin|Lois]], along with her husband, [[Peter Griffin|Peter]], discover an old photo album showcasing Barbara and Carter's love for each other, as well as Barbara's short-lived affair during the \"Great War with Alaska\", during which, after returning home from combat, Carter reclaims his wife, and the two's love is shown to have lasted ever since. Becoming bored, Peter decides to call his father-in-law to dinner, and soon discovers Carter in his yacht, having sex with a dark-haired Asian woman. Questioning his father-in-law's judgment, he eventually promises to keep the affair a secret from Barbara. The next day, at the Drunken Clam, Peter begins discussing the affair with [[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]] and [[Joe Swanson|Joe]], who suggest Peter blackmail Carter as revenge for his constant mistreatment.\n\nVisiting his wife's parents during the middle of the night, Peter informs Carter that he is now his personal slave, and must perform any task he wishes, including having a limousine joust and writing witty catchphrases. Noticing Peter and Carter spending time together, Barbara and Lois soon witness the two taking a high-definition television out of the house. But while they are doing this, Peter accidentally spills the beans to Barbara about the affair, and Barbera is instantly devastated by this and runs of the room sobbing.\nEnraged, \nCarter announces that he and Barbara are getting a divorce, causing Peter to suggest he meet other people. Taking him to the local club, Peter introduces Carter to the dating scene, where he soon meets Paula, an attractive blonde. Going on to demand an [[African American]] patron fetch him a drink, Carter is accused of being a racist by Paula, who leaves him. Continuing to desire Barbara, Carter decides to take a bouquet of roses to his former wife. While there, he discovers that Barbara has begun dating the man she had an affair with during the war (who sings to her in the tune of 'The Miners Mother'). Announcing he has something important to say to Barbara, Carter confesses his love for her, and apologizes. Barbara then allows Carter to earn her trust by letting him move back in, and the two ultimately embrace in a passionate kiss. <!--The genie lamp is not a part of the plot. Do not add it.

{"title_page": "Voting", "text_new": "{{Redirect|Vote}}\n{{Redirect|Voter}}\n\n{{Voting images}}\n\n'''Voting''' is a method for a group, such as a meeting or legal cheating by the electorate, to get votes or express an opinion usually following stupid and gay cults, Like [[Trump Pence|TrumpPence]]. \n\nIn smaller organisations, voting can occur in different ways. Formally via ballot to elect others for example within a workplace, to elect members of political associations or to choose roles for others. Informally voting could occur as spoken agreement or as a verbal gesture like a raised hand.\n\n== In politics ==\nIn a [[democracy]], a [[government]] is chosen by voting in an [[election]]: a way for an electorate to elect, i.e. choose, among several candidates for rule.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/browse/citizenship/voting|title=Voting - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-06-09}}</ref> In a [[representative democracy]] ''voting'' is the method by which the electorate appoints its representatives to government.\nIn a [[direct democracy]], ''voting'' is the method by which the electorate directly make decisions, turn [[bill (law)|bill]]s into laws, etc.\n\nA vote is a formal expression of an individual's choice for or against some [[motion (parliamentary procedure)|motion]] (for example, a proposed resolution); for or against some [[ballot question]]; or for a certain candidate, selection of candidates, or [[political party]]. Many countries use a [[secret ballot]], a practice to prevent voters from being intimidated and to protect their [[political privacy]].\n\nVoting often takes place at a [[polling station]]; it is voluntary in some countries, [[Compulsory voting|compulsory]] in others, such as Australia.\n\n=== Electoral systems ===\n{{Voting}}\n{{main|Voting system|Election}}\n[[File:Swiss voting material.jpg|thumb|left|In [[Voting in Switzerland|Switzerland]], without need to register, every citizen receives at home the [[ballot papers]] and information brochure for each voting (and can send it by post). Switzerland has a [[direct democracy]] system and votes (and elections) are organised about four times a year; here, to [[Bern#Politics|Berne]]'s citizen in November 2008 about 5 national, 2 cantonal, 4 municipal referendums, and 2 elections (government and parliament of the City of Berne) to take care of at the same time.]]\nDifferent [[voting system]]s use different types of votes. [[Plurality voting]] does not require the winner to achieve a vote majority, or more than fifty percent of the total votes cast. In a voting system that uses a single vote per race, when more than two candidates run, the winner may commonly have less than fifty percent of the vote.\n\nA side effect of a single vote per race is [[vote splitting]], which tends to elect candidates that do not support [[centrism]], and tends to produce a [[two-party system]]. An alternative to a single-vote system is [[approval voting]].\n\nTo understand why a single vote per race tends to favor less centric candidates, consider a simple lab experiment where students in a class vote for their favorite marble. If five marbles are assigned names and are placed \"up for election\", and if three of them are green, one is red, and one is blue, then a green marble will rarely win the election. The reason is that the three green marbles will split the votes of those who prefer green. In fact, in this analogy, the only way that a green marble is likely to win is if more than sixty percent of the voters prefer green. If the same percentage of people prefer green as those who prefer red and blue, that is to say if 33 percent of the voters prefer green, 33 percent prefer blue, and 33 percent prefer red, then each green marble will only get eleven percent of the vote, while the red and blue marbles will each get 33 percent, putting the green marbles at a serious disadvantage. If the experiment is repeated with other colors, the color that is in the majority will still rarely win. In other words, from a purely mathematical perspective, a single-vote system tends to favor a winner that is different from the majority. If the experiment is repeated using [[approval voting]], where voters are encouraged to vote for as many candidates as they approve of, then the winner is much more likely to be any one of the five marbles, because people who prefer green will be able to vote for every one of the green marbles.\n\n<!-- Needs attention \u2193 -->\nA development on the 'single vote' system is to have [[Two-round system|two-round]] elections, or repeat [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]]. This system is most common around the world. In most cases, the winner must receive a majority, which is more than half.<ref>[[Majority rule]].</ref>  and if no candidate obtains a majority at the first round, then the two candidates with the largest plurality are selected for the second round. Variants exist on these two points: the requirement for being elected at the first round is sometimes less than 50%, and the rules for participation in the runoff may vary.\n\nAn alternative to the Two-round voting system is the single round [[instant-runoff voting]] system (Also referred to as ''Alternative vote'' or ''[[Ranked voting systems|Preferential voting]]'') as used in some elections in Australia, Ireland and the USA. Voters rank each candidate in order of preference (1,2,3 etc.). Votes are distributed to each candidate according to the preferences allocated. If no single candidate has 50% of the vote, then the candidate with the fewest votes is excluded and their votes redistributed according to the voters nominated order of preference. The process repeating itself until a candidate has 50% or more votes. The system is designed to produce the same result as an [[exhaustive ballot]] but using only a single round of voting.\n\nIn a voting system that uses a ''multiple vote'', the voter can vote for any subset of the alternatives. So, a voter might vote for Alice, Bob, and Charlie, rejecting Daniel and Emily. [[Approval voting]] uses such multiple votes.\n\nIn a voting system that uses a ''ranked vote'', the voter has to rank the alternatives in order of preference. For example, they might vote for Bob in first place, then Emily, then Alice, then Daniel, and finally Charlie. [[Ranked voting systems]], such as those famously used in Australia, use a ranked vote.\n\nIn a voting system that uses a ''scored vote'' (or ''range vote''), the voter gives each alternative a number between one and ten (the upper and lower bounds may vary). See [[cardinal voting systems]].\n\nSome \"multiple-winner\" systems may have a single vote or one vote per elector per available position. In such a case the elector could vote for Bob and Charlie on a ballot with two votes. These types of systems can use ranked or [[Plurality-at-large voting|unranked]] voting, and are often used for [[at-large]] positions such as on some city councils.\n\n=== Referendums ===\n\nMost of the time, when the citizens of a country are invited to vote, it is for an [[election]]. However, people can also vote in [[referendum]]s and [[initiative]]s. Since the end of the eighteenth century, more than five hundred national referendums (including initiatives) were organised in the world; among them, more than three hundred were held in [[Voting in Switzerland|Switzerland]].<ref>{{in lang|fr}} Bruno S. Frey et Claudia Frey Marti, ''Le bonheur. L'approche \u00e9conomique'', [[Presses polytechniques et universitaires romandes]], 2013 ({{ISBN|978-2-88915-010-6}}).</ref> [[Australia]] ranked second with dozens of referendums.\n\n=== Fair voting ===\n{{Confusing|date=July 2011}}\nResults may lead at best to confusion, at worst to violence and even [[civil war]], in the case of political rivals. Many alternatives may fall in the latitude of indifference\u2014they are neither accepted nor rejected. Avoiding the choice that most people strongly reject may sometimes be at least as important as choosing the one that they most favour.\n\nThere are [[social choice theory]] definitions of seemingly reasonable criteria that are a measure of the fairness of certain aspects of voting, including [[non-dictatorship]], [[unrestricted domain]], non-imposition, [[Pareto efficiency]], and [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]] but [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] states that no voting system can meet all these standards.\n\nTo ensure fair voting and preventing the misuse of the microblogging platform, [[Twitter]] announced for adding a feature for users to report content that misleads voters. This announcement came when general elections are going to be held in India and some other countries.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/info-tech/twitter-adds-feature-for-users-to-report-content-that-misleads-voters/article26933008.ece|title=Twitter adds feature for users to report content that misleads voters|date=2019-04-24|work=thehindubusinessline|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Negative voting ===\n\n{{Main|Disapproval voting}}\n\nNegative voting allows a vote that expresses disapproval of a candidate.  For explanatory purposes, consider a hypothetical voting system that uses negative voting.  In this system, one vote is allowed, with the choice of either  for a candidate, or against a candidate.  Each positive vote adds one to a candidate's overall total, while a negative vote subtracts one, arriving at a net favorability.  The candidate with the highest net favorability is the winner. Note that not only is a negative total possible, but also, a candidate may even be elected with 0 votes if enough negative votes are cast against their opponents.\n\nUnder this implementation, negative voting is no different from a positive voting system, when only two candidates are on the ballot. However, in the case of three or more candidates, each negative vote for a candidate counts positively towards all of the other candidates.\n\nConsider the following example:\n\nThree candidates are running for the same seat.  Two hypothetical election results are given, contrasting positive and negative voting.  Both polling accuracy and voter turnout are assumed to be 100 percent.\n\n<div float=none>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"left\"\n|+ Current standing in the polls\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Candidate \n! scope=\"col\" | Party\n! scope=\"col\" right | Polling \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | A\n| Party 1|| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 40%\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | B\n| Party 2|| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 30%\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | C\n| Party 3|| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 30%\n|}\n{| align=\"left\"\n|+\n|  \n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"left\"  \n|+ Election results after positive voting\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Candidates\n! scope=\"col\" | A voters\n! scope=\"col\" | B voters\n! scope=\"col\" | C voters\n! scope=\"col\" | Net total \n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| A\n| style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | +40 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | +15 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | +55\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | B\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | C\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | +15 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | +30 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | +45\n|}\n{| align=\"left\"\n|+\n|  \n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"left\"\n|+ Election results after negative voting\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Candidates\n! scope=\"col\" | A voters\n! scope=\"col\" | B voters\n! scope=\"col\" | C voters\n! scope=\"col\" | Net total \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | A\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | +40 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | -15 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | -30 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | -5\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | B\n| style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | 0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | C\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | -15 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" |-15\n|}\n</div>\n{{clear}}\n\n'''Election results with positive voting:'''\n\nA-voters, with the clear advantage of 40%, logically vote for Candidate A.

C-voters also decide to vote negatively against Candidate A, reasoning along similar lines.  Candidate B is the winner with 0 votes.  Enough negative votes were cast against Candidate B's opponents, resulting in negative totals.  Candidate A, despite having polled at 40%,  winds up with -5%, offset due to the aggregate 45% of negative votes cast by B and C voters. Candidate C ends up with -15%.\n\n=== Proxy voting ===\n{{Main|Proxy voting}}\nProxy voting is the type of voting where a registered citizen who is able to vote passes on his or her vote to a different voter or electorate legitimately.\n\n=== Anti-voting ===\n{{Main|Abstention}}\n\nIn [[South Africa]], there is a strong presence of anti-voting campaigns by poor citizens. They make the structural argument that no political party truly represents them. For instance, this resulted in the \"[[No Land! No House!

These include the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] and various [[anarchist]]-oriented movements.\n\nIt is possible to make a [[blank vote]], carrying out the act of voting, which may be compulsory, without selecting any candidate or option, often as an act of protest. In some jurisdictions, there is an official [[none of the above]] option and it is counted as a valid vote. Usually, blank and null votes are counted (together or separately) but are not considered valid.\n\n=== Voting and information ===\nModern political science has questioned whether [[average]] citizens have sufficient political information to cast meaningful votes. A series of studies coming out of the [[University of Michigan]] in the 1950s and 1960s argued that voters lack a basic understanding of current issues, the [[Liberalism|liberal]]\u2013[[Conservatism|conservative]] [[Ideology|ideological]] dimension, and the relative ideological dilemma.<ref>Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.

The right to vote is usually restricted to certain people. Members of a society or club, or shareholders of a company, but not outsiders, may elect its officers, or adopt or change its rules, in a similar way to the election of people to official positions. A panel of judges, either formal judicial authorities or, say, judges of a competition, may make decisions by voting. A group of friends or members of a family may decide which film to see by voting. The method of voting can range from formal submission of written votes, through [[Voting methods in deliberative assemblies#Show of hands|show of hands]], [[voice voting]] or [[audience response]] systems, to informally noting which outcome seems to be preferred by more people.\n\n=== Voting basis ===\n{{See also|Majority|Supermajority|Unanimity}}According to [[Robert's Rules of Order]], a widely used guide to [[parliamentary procedure]], the bases for determining the voting result consist of two elements: (1) the percentage of votes that are required for a proposal to be adopted or for a candidate to be elected (e.g. more than half, two-thirds, three-quarters, etc.); and (2) the set of members to which the proportion applies (e.g. the members present and voting, the members present, the entire membership of the organization, the entire electorate, etc.).<ref>{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 402|edition = 11th|ref = harv|display-authors=etal|title-link = Robert's Rules of Order}}</ref> An example is a majority vote of the members present and voting.\n\nThe voting result could also be determined using a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]], or the most votes among the choices.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|pp = 404\u2013405}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, a decision could be made without a formal vote by using [[unanimous consent]].<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 54}}</ref>\n\n{{Electoral systems}}\n{{About-distinguish2|the physical means of casting ballots|details of voting theory, for which see [[Electoral system]]}}\nA '''voting method''' is the way in which people cast their votes in an [[election]] or [[referendum]]. There are several different methods in use around the world.\n\n==Voting methods in deliberative assemblies==\n{{main|Voting methods in deliberative assemblies}}\n[[Deliberative assembly|Deliberative assemblies]]\u2014bodies that use [[parliamentary procedure]] to arrive at [[Decision making|decisions]]\u2014use several methods of voting on [[motion (parliamentary procedure)|motions]] (formal proposal by a member or members of a deliberative assembly that the assembly take certain action). The regular methods of voting in such bodies are a voice vote, a rising vote, and a show of hands. Additional forms of voting include a recorded vote and balloting. The assembly could decide on the voting method by adopting a motion on it. Different legislatures may have their own voting methods.\n\n==Voting methods==\n{{Redirect-distinguish|Voting method|Electoral system}}\n\n===Paper-based methods===\nThe most common voting method uses paper [[ballot]]s on which voters mark their preferences. This may involve marking their support for a candidate or party listed on the ballot, or a [[Write-in candidate|write-in]], where they write out the name of their preferred candidate if it is not listed.\n\n[[Image:Kalpi israel 18.JPG|Ballot letters in Israel|thumb|150px|right]]\nAn alternative paper-based system known as [[ballot letters]] is used in [[Israel]], where polling booths contain a tray with ballots for each party contesting the elections; the ballots are marked with the letter(s) assigned to that party. Voters are given an envelope into which they put the ballot of the party they wish to vote for, before placing the envelope in the [[ballot box]]. The same system is also implemented in [[Latvia]].\n\n===Machine voting===\n{{main|Voting machine|Electronic voting}}\n\nMachine voting uses [[voting machine]]s, which may be manual (e.g. [[Voting machine#Direct-recording voting system|lever machines]]) or [[Electronic voting|electronic]]. In Brazil, voters type in the number of the candidate they wish to vote for and then confirm their vote when the candidate's photo is displayed on screen.<ref>[https://www.economist.com/news/international/21600162-teaching-those-who-cannot-read-how-vote-makes-cleaner-fairer-elections-making-their Illiterate voters: Making their mark] The Economist, 5 April 2014</ref>\n\n===Online voting===\nIn some countries people are allowed to vote online. Estonia was one of the first countries to use [[Electronic voting in Estonia|online voting]]: it was first used in the [[Estonian municipal elections, 2005|2005 local elections]].<ref>[http://www.vvk.ee/voting-methods-in-estonia/engindex/statistics Voting methods in Estonia: Statistics about Internet Voting in Estonia] VVK</ref>\n\n===Postal voting===\nMany countries allow [[postal voting]], where voters are sent a ballot and return it by post.\n\n===Open ballot===\nIn contrast to a [[secret ballot]], an [[Open ballot system|open ballot]] takes place in public and is commonly done by a show of hands. An example is the [[Landsgemeinde]] system in Switzerland, which is still in use in the [[Swiss canton|cantons]] of [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]], [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]], [[Grisons]], and [[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]].\n\n===Other methods===\nIn [[The Gambia]], voting is carried out using marbles, a method introduced in 1965 to deal with [[illiteracy]].<ref name=BBC>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/5369966.stm Gambians vote with their marbles] BBC News, 22 September 2006</ref> Polling stations contain metal drums painted in party colours and emblems with candidates' photos attached to them.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/29/gambia-vote-roll-marbles/ Gambia vote a roll of the marbles] The Telegrapgh, 29 November 2016</ref><ref name=BBC/> Voters are given a marble to place in the drum of their chosen candidate; when dropped into the drum, a bell sounds to register the vote.

This led to the coining of the term [[blackballing]].\n\n===In person===\n{{see also|Voting methods in deliberative assemblies}}\nSome votes are carried in person if all the people eligible to vote are present.

[[Democracy|Democracies]] elect holders of high office by voting.  Residents of a place represented by an elected official are called \"constituents\", and those constituents who cast a [[ballot]] for their chosen candidate are called \"voters\".  There are different systems for collecting votes.\n\nIn smaller organisations, voting can occur in different ways. Formally via ballot to elect others for example within a workplace, to elect members of political associations or to choose roles for others. Informally voting could occur as spoken agreement or as a verbal gesture like a raised hand.\n\n== In politics ==\nIn a [[democracy]], a [[government]] is chosen by voting in an [[election]]: a way for an electorate to elect, i.e. choose, among several candidates for rule.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/browse/citizenship/voting|title=Voting - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-06-09}}</ref> In a [[representative democracy]] ''voting'' is the method by which the electorate appoints its representatives to government.\nIn a [[direct democracy]], ''voting'' is the method by which the electorate directly make decisions, turn [[bill (law)|bill]]s into laws, etc.\n\nA vote is a formal expression of an individual's choice for or against some [[motion (parliamentary procedure)|motion]] (for example, a proposed resolution); for or against some [[ballot question]]; or for a certain candidate, selection of candidates, or [[political party]]. Many countries use a [[secret ballot]], a practice to prevent voters from being intimidated and to protect their [[political privacy]].\n\nVoting often takes place at a [[polling station]]; it is voluntary in some countries, [[Compulsory voting|compulsory]] in others, such as Australia.\n\n=== Electoral systems ===\n{{Voting}}\n{{main|Voting system|Election}}\n[[File:Swiss voting material.jpg|thumb|left|In [[Voting in Switzerland|Switzerland]], without need to register, every citizen receives at home the [[ballot papers]] and information brochure for each voting (and can send it by post). Switzerland has a [[direct democracy]] system and votes (and elections) are organised about four times a year; here, to [[Bern#Politics|Berne]]'s citizen in November 2008 about 5 national, 2 cantonal, 4 municipal referendums, and 2 elections (government and parliament of the City of Berne) to take care of at the same time.]]\nDifferent [[voting system]]s use different types of votes. [[Plurality voting]] does not require the winner to achieve a vote majority, or more than fifty percent of the total votes cast. In a voting system that uses a single vote per race, when more than two candidates run, the winner may commonly have less than fifty percent of the vote.\n\nA side effect of a single vote per race is [[vote splitting]], which tends to elect candidates that do not support [[centrism]], and tends to produce a [[two-party system]]. An alternative to a single-vote system is [[approval voting]].\n\nTo understand why a single vote per race tends to favor less centric candidates, consider a simple lab experiment where students in a class vote for their favorite marble. If five marbles are assigned names and are placed \"up for election\", and if three of them are green, one is red, and one is blue, then a green marble will rarely win the election. The reason is that the three green marbles will split the votes of those who prefer green. In fact, in this analogy, the only way that a green marble is likely to win is if more than sixty percent of the voters prefer green. If the same percentage of people prefer green as those who prefer red and blue, that is to say if 33 percent of the voters prefer green, 33 percent prefer blue, and 33 percent prefer red, then each green marble will only get eleven percent of the vote, while the red and blue marbles will each get 33 percent, putting the green marbles at a serious disadvantage. If the experiment is repeated with other colors, the color that is in the majority will still rarely win. In other words, from a purely mathematical perspective, a single-vote system tends to favor a winner that is different from the majority. If the experiment is repeated using [[approval voting]], where voters are encouraged to vote for as many candidates as they approve of, then the winner is much more likely to be any one of the five marbles, because people who prefer green will be able to vote for every one of the green marbles.\n\n<!-- Needs attention \u2193 -->\nA development on the 'single vote' system is to have [[Two-round system|two-round]] elections, or repeat [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]]. This system is most common around the world. In most cases, the winner must receive a majority, which is more than half.<ref>[[Majority rule]].</ref>  and if no candidate obtains a majority at the first round, then the two candidates with the largest plurality are selected for the second round. Variants exist on these two points: the requirement for being elected at the first round is sometimes less than 50%, and the rules for participation in the runoff may vary.\n\nAn alternative to the Two-round voting system is the single round [[instant-runoff voting]] system (Also referred to as ''Alternative vote'' or ''[[Ranked voting systems|Preferential voting]]'') as used in some elections in Australia, Ireland and the USA. Voters rank each candidate in order of preference (1,2,3 etc.). Votes are distributed to each candidate according to the preferences allocated. If no single candidate has 50% of the vote, then the candidate with the fewest votes is excluded and their votes redistributed according to the voters nominated order of preference. The process repeating itself until a candidate has 50% or more votes. The system is designed to produce the same result as an [[exhaustive ballot]] but using only a single round of voting.\n\nIn a voting system that uses a ''multiple vote'', the voter can vote for any subset of the alternatives. So, a voter might vote for Alice, Bob, and Charlie, rejecting Daniel and Emily. [[Approval voting]] uses such multiple votes.\n\nIn a voting system that uses a ''ranked vote'', the voter has to rank the alternatives in order of preference. For example, they might vote for Bob in first place, then Emily, then Alice, then Daniel, and finally Charlie. [[Ranked voting systems]], such as those famously used in Australia, use a ranked vote.\n\nIn a voting system that uses a ''scored vote'' (or ''range vote''), the voter gives each alternative a number between one and ten (the upper and lower bounds may vary). See [[cardinal voting systems]].\n\nSome \"multiple-winner\" systems may have a single vote or one vote per elector per available position. In such a case the elector could vote for Bob and Charlie on a ballot with two votes. These types of systems can use ranked or [[Plurality-at-large voting|unranked]] voting, and are often used for [[at-large]] positions such as on some city councils.\n\n=== Referendums ===\n\nMost of the time, when the citizens of a country are invited to vote, it is for an [[election]]. However, people can also vote in [[referendum]]s and [[initiative]]s. Since the end of the eighteenth century, more than five hundred national referendums (including initiatives) were organised in the world; among them, more than three hundred were held in [[Voting in Switzerland|Switzerland]].<ref>{{in lang|fr}} Bruno S. Frey et Claudia Frey Marti, ''Le bonheur. L'approche \u00e9conomique'', [[Presses polytechniques et universitaires romandes]], 2013 ({{ISBN|978-2-88915-010-6}}).</ref> [[Australia]] ranked second with dozens of referendums.\n\n=== Fair voting ===\n{{Confusing|date=July 2011}}\nResults may lead at best to confusion, at worst to violence and even [[civil war]], in the case of political rivals. Many alternatives may fall in the latitude of indifference\u2014they are neither accepted nor rejected. Avoiding the choice that most people strongly reject may sometimes be at least as important as choosing the one that they most favour.\n\nThere are [[social choice theory]] definitions of seemingly reasonable criteria that are a measure of the fairness of certain aspects of voting, including [[non-dictatorship]], [[unrestricted domain]], non-imposition, [[Pareto efficiency]], and [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]] but [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] states that no voting system can meet all these standards.\n\nTo ensure fair voting and preventing the misuse of the microblogging platform, [[Twitter]] announced for adding a feature for users to report content that misleads voters. This announcement came when general elections are going to be held in India and some other countries.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/info-tech/twitter-adds-feature-for-users-to-report-content-that-misleads-voters/article26933008.ece|title=Twitter adds feature for users to report content that misleads voters|date=2019-04-24|work=thehindubusinessline|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Negative voting ===\n\n{{Main|Disapproval voting}}\n\nNegative voting allows a vote that expresses disapproval of a candidate.  For explanatory purposes, consider a hypothetical voting system that uses negative voting.  In this system, one vote is allowed, with the choice of either  for a candidate, or against a candidate.  Each positive vote adds one to a candidate's overall total, while a negative vote subtracts one, arriving at a net favorability.  The candidate with the highest net favorability is the winner. Note that not only is a negative total possible, but also, a candidate may even be elected with 0 votes if enough negative votes are cast against their opponents.\n\nUnder this implementation, negative voting is no different from a positive voting system, when only two candidates are on the ballot. However, in the case of three or more candidates, each negative vote for a candidate counts positively towards all of the other candidates.\n\nConsider the following example:\n\nThree candidates are running for the same seat.  Two hypothetical election results are given, contrasting positive and negative voting.  Both polling accuracy and voter turnout are assumed to be 100 percent.\n\n<div float=none>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"left\"\n|+ Current standing in the polls\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Candidate \n! scope=\"col\" | Party\n! scope=\"col\" right | Polling \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | A\n| Party 1|| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 40%\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | B\n| Party 2|| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 30%\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | C\n| Party 3|| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 30%\n|}\n{| align=\"left\"\n|+\n|  \n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"left\"  \n|+ Election results after positive voting\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Candidates\n! scope=\"col\" | A voters\n! scope=\"col\" | B voters\n! scope=\"col\" | C voters\n! scope=\"col\" | Net total \n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| A\n| style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | +40 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | +15 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | +55\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | B\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | C\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | +15 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | +30 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | +45\n|}\n{| align=\"left\"\n|+\n|  \n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"left\"\n|+ Election results after negative voting\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Candidates\n! scope=\"col\" | A voters\n! scope=\"col\" | B voters\n! scope=\"col\" | C voters\n! scope=\"col\" | Net total \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | A\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | +40 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | -15 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | -30 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | -5\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | B\n| style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | 0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | C\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | -15 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" |-15\n|}\n</div>\n{{clear}}\n\n'''Election results with positive voting:'''\n\nA-voters, with the clear advantage of 40%, logically vote for Candidate A.

B-voters again, split exactly in half.

C-voters also decide to vote negatively against Candidate A, reasoning along similar lines.  Candidate B is the winner with 0 votes.  Enough negative votes were cast against Candidate B's opponents, resulting in negative totals.  Candidate A, despite having polled at 40%,  winds up with -5%, offset due to the aggregate 45% of negative votes cast by B and C voters. Candidate C ends up with -15%.\n\n=== Proxy voting ===\n{{Main|Proxy voting}}\nProxy voting is the type of voting where a registered citizen who is able to vote passes on his or her vote to a different voter or electorate legitimately.\n\n=== Anti-voting ===\n{{Main|Abstention}}\n\nIn [[South Africa]], there is a strong presence of anti-voting campaigns by poor citizens.

The right to vote is usually restricted to certain people. Members of a society or club, or shareholders of a company, but not outsiders, may elect its officers, or adopt or change its rules, in a similar way to the election of people to official positions. A panel of judges, either formal judicial authorities or, say, judges of a competition, may make decisions by voting. A group of friends or members of a family may decide which film to see by voting. The method of voting can range from formal submission of written votes, through [[Voting methods in deliberative assemblies#Show of hands|show of hands]], [[voice voting]] or [[audience response]] systems, to informally noting which outcome seems to be preferred by more people.\n\n=== Voting basis ===\n{{See also|Majority|Supermajority|Unanimity}}According to [[Robert's Rules of Order]], a widely used guide to [[parliamentary procedure]], the bases for determining the voting result consist of two elements: (1) the percentage of votes that are required for a proposal to be adopted or for a candidate to be elected (e.g. more than half, two-thirds, three-quarters, etc.); and (2) the set of members to which the proportion applies (e.g. the members present and voting, the members present, the entire membership of the organization, the entire electorate, etc.).<ref>{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 402|edition = 11th|ref = harv|display-authors=etal|title-link = Robert's Rules of Order}}</ref> An example is a majority vote of the members present and voting.\n\nThe voting result could also be determined using a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]], or the most votes among the choices.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|pp = 404\u2013405}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, a decision could be made without a formal vote by using [[unanimous consent]].<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 54}}</ref>\n\n{{Electoral systems}}\n{{About-distinguish2|the physical means of casting ballots|details of voting theory, for which see [[Electoral system]]}}\nA '''voting method''' is the way in which people cast their votes in an [[election]] or [[referendum]]. There are several different methods in use around the world.\n\n==Voting methods in deliberative assemblies==\n{{main|Voting methods in deliberative assemblies}}\n[[Deliberative assembly|Deliberative assemblies]]\u2014bodies that use [[parliamentary procedure]] to arrive at [[Decision making|decisions]]\u2014use several methods of voting on [[motion (parliamentary procedure)|motions]] (formal proposal by a member or members of a deliberative assembly that the assembly take certain action). The regular methods of voting in such bodies are a voice vote, a rising vote, and a show of hands. Additional forms of voting include a recorded vote and balloting. The assembly could decide on the voting method by adopting a motion on it. Different legislatures may have their own voting methods.\n\n==Voting methods==\n{{Redirect-distinguish|Voting method|Electoral system}}\n\n===Paper-based methods===\nThe most common voting method uses paper [[ballot]]s on which voters mark their preferences. This may involve marking their support for a candidate or party listed on the ballot, or a [[Write-in candidate|write-in]], where they write out the name of their preferred candidate if it is not listed.\n\n[[Image:Kalpi israel 18.JPG|Ballot letters in Israel|thumb|150px|right]]\nAn alternative paper-based system known as [[ballot letters]] is used in [[Israel]], where polling booths contain a tray with ballots for each party contesting the elections; the ballots are marked with the letter(s) assigned to that party. Voters are given an envelope into which they put the ballot of the party they wish to vote for, before placing the envelope in the [[ballot box]]. The same system is also implemented in [[Latvia]].\n\n===Machine voting===\n{{main|Voting machine|Electronic voting}}\n\nMachine voting uses [[voting machine]]s, which may be manual (e.g. [[Voting machine#Direct-recording voting system|lever machines]]) or [[Electronic voting|electronic]]. In Brazil, voters type in the number of the candidate they wish to vote for and then confirm their vote when the candidate's photo is displayed on screen.<ref>[https://www.economist.com/news/international/21600162-teaching-those-who-cannot-read-how-vote-makes-cleaner-fairer-elections-making-their Illiterate voters: Making their mark] The Economist, 5 April 2014</ref>\n\n===Online voting===\nIn some countries people are allowed to vote online. Estonia was one of the first countries to use [[Electronic voting in Estonia|online voting]]: it was first used in the [[Estonian municipal elections, 2005|2005 local elections]].<ref>[http://www.vvk.ee/voting-methods-in-estonia/engindex/statistics Voting methods in Estonia: Statistics about Internet Voting in Estonia] VVK</ref>\n\n===Postal voting===\nMany countries allow [[postal voting]], where voters are sent a ballot and return it by post.\n\n===Open ballot===\nIn contrast to a [[secret ballot]], an [[Open ballot system|open ballot]] takes place in public and is commonly done by a show of hands. An example is the [[Landsgemeinde]] system in Switzerland, which is still in use in the [[Swiss canton|cantons]] of [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]], [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]], [[Grisons]], and [[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]].\n\n===Other methods===\nIn [[The Gambia]], voting is carried out using marbles, a method introduced in 1965 to deal with [[illiteracy]].<ref name=BBC>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/5369966.stm Gambians vote with their marbles] BBC News, 22 September 2006</ref> Polling stations contain metal drums painted in party colours and emblems with candidates' photos attached to them.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/29/gambia-vote-roll-marbles/ Gambia vote a roll of the marbles] The Telegrapgh, 29 November 2016</ref><ref name=BBC/> Voters are given a marble to place in the drum of their chosen candidate; when dropped into the drum, a bell sounds to register the vote. To avoid confusion, bicycles are banned near polling booths on election day.<ref name=BBC/> If the marble is left on top of the drum rather than placed in it, the vote is deemed invalid.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-38164870 Gambia election: Voters use marbles to choose president] BBC News, 30 November 2016</ref>\n\nA similar system used in social clubs sees voters given a white ball to indicate support and a black ball to indicate opposition. This led to the coining of the term [[blackballing]].\n\n===In person===\n{{see also|Voting methods in deliberative assemblies}}\nSome votes are carried in person if all the people eligible to vote are present. This could be by a show of hands or [[keypad polling]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n*[[Cosmopolitan democracy]]\n*[[Democratic mundialization]]\n*[[Dollar voting]]\n*[[Electoral fraud]]\n*[[Electoral system]]\n*[[Gerrymandering]]\n*[[Mandate (politics)]]\n*[[Ranked voting systems]]\n*[[Opinion poll]]\n*[[Presidential election]]\n*[[Proportional representation]]\n*[[Psephology]]\n*[[Redistricting]]\n*[[Referendum]]\n*[[Suffrage]]\n*[[Voter turnout]]\n*[[Voting methods in deliberative assemblies]]\n*[[Voting system]]\n*[[Right of expatriates to vote in their country of origin]]\n*[[Vote Splitting]]}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|vote|voting}}\n{{Commons category|Voting}}\n*[http://americanhistory.si.edu/vote/ A history of voting in the United States] from the [[Smithsonian Institution]].\n*[http://dca.tufts.edu/features/aas A New Nation Votes: American Elections Returns 1787-1825]\n*[http://www.canivote.org/ Can I Vote?]\u2014a nonpartisan US resource for registering to vote and finding your polling place from the [http://www.nass.org/ National Association of Secretaries of State].\n* [http://www.civilization.ca/cmc/exhibitions/hist/elections/el_000_e.shtml The Canadian Museum of Civilization \u2014 A History of the Vote in Canada ]\n*{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Vote|volume=28|pages=216\u2013217}} This contains a brief history of voting in [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]; see also [[Electoral system#History|Electoral system s.v.

It originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on May 10, 2009. The episode is split into three segments, parodying films based on three [[Stephen King]] stories: ''[[Stand by Me (film)|Stand by Me]]'', ''[[Misery (film)|Misery]]'' and ''[[The Shawshank Redemption]]''.\n\nThe episode was written by [[Alec Sulkin]] and directed by [[Dominic Bianchi]]. The episode received mostly positive reviews for its break from the usual storyline in the series, in addition to receiving some criticism from the [[Parents Television Council]]. According to [[Nielsen ratings]], it was viewed in 6.47 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by [[Richard Dreyfuss]], [[Roy Scheider]] and [[George Wendt]], along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe episode opens with [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] sitting in a study, explaining that \"[[Lois Griffin|Lois]] has been bitching that I watch too much TV and don't read enough books.\" He then picks out three novels by \"the greatest author of the last thousand years\", [[Stephen King]], and proceeds to share them with the viewer.\n\n===''[[The Body (novella)|Stand by Me]]''===\nIn the summer of 1955, four 12-year-old boys \u2014 Petey LaChance (Peter, with [[Richard Dreyfuss]]' voice in his head narrating the story), Quag Chambers ([[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]]), Joey Duchamp ([[Joe Swanson|Joe]] with [[Roy Scheider]]'s voice in his head, who starts talking with Dreyfuss until Joe stops them), and Cleve Brown ([[Cleveland Brown|Cleveland]]) \u2014 set out to find a dead body in the woods, following a set of railroad tracks to find it. At the start of their trip, they try going through Old Man Pressman's ([[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]]) junkyard, only to be chased out by Pressman and his dog Chopper ([[Brian Griffin|Brian]]). As they travel further down the tracks, they are chased across a bridge by a [[train]], which ends up running over Joey's legs, as does another train that follows closely behind, which effectively cripples him. The others end up going all the way back to Pressman's junkyard to get him a [[wheelchair]].\n\nUpon finding the body (which turns out to be [[Meg Griffin]]), they are confronted by the town bully Ace ([[Adam West (Family Guy)|Mayor West]]) and his gang, consisting of [[Beast-Man]], [[List of Masters of the Universe characters#Mer-Man|Mer-Man]], and [[Norm Peterson|Norm]] from ''[[Cheers]]'', who come to take credit for finding the body. Ace threatens the boys with a knife, but Petey pulls out a gun to intimidate Ace, who swears he will come back for revenge and could get a gun tomorrow. However, since their next meeting will be inevitable, as they live in the same neighborhood, Petey lets Ace have the body to avoid further consequences. Upon returning home, the boys go their separate ways; Joey comes to terms with being crippled and creates a new [[wheelchair rugby]] game called \"Don't-Feel-Sorry-For-Us-Ball\", Cleve grows up to marry [[Rebecca Romijn]] (who is the real-life wife of [[Jerry O'Connell]], who played the character of \"the fat kid\" in the actual film), and Quag grows up to become a famous Hollywood actor who eventually dies of a [[drug overdose]] (a reference to the fact [[River Phoenix]], who played Chris Chambers in the actual film, went the same way and the unseen adult version of Chris dies, but in a different manner), while Petey's fate becomes a mystery.\n\n===[[Misery (novel)|''Misery'']]===\nFamed writer Paul Sheldon ([[Brian Griffin|Brian]]) has just finished his latest and final installment in his series entitled ''Snuggly Jeff'', a series of children's books, in which he kills off the titular character so he can focus on more serious work, despite objections from his [[literary agent|agent]], Marcia ([[Lois Griffin|Lois]]). While driving through a snowstorm, Paul accidentally hits [[Stephen King]] with his car, causing Paul to swerve off the road and crash into a snowbank. Paul is knocked unconscious in his car, while King, thrown aside by the impact, manages to conceive and write [[Dreamcatcher (novel)|an entire novel]] in midair before hitting the ground completely unscathed.\n\nPaul is rescued by [[Annie Wilkes|Stewie Wilkes]] ([[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]]), Paul's self-proclaimed number-one fan, who takes the injured Paul to his/her remote cabin. Upon finding and reading the manuscript of Paul's latest ''Snuggly Jeff'' book, Stewie is infuriated about the main character's death and forces Paul to rewrite it and bring Snuggly Jeff back to life, holding him hostage until he manages to do so. Stewie rejects the idea of bringing Snuggly Jeff back to life with a child's wish, calling it bad storytelling and comparing it to a plot hole in the film ''[[Contact (1997 American film)|Contact]]''.\n\nAfter sending Stewie out for more paper, Paul finds several news articles in an album that imply Wilkes is actually a [[serial killer]]. Just then, the local sheriff ([[Joe Swanson|Joe]]) appears, and is surprised to find Paul there. Before he can help him, however, Stewie blows his legs off with a [[shotgun]]. The sheriff then complains that he will now have to spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair, only to be shot again and killed by Stewie. Paul finally finishes the book and demands Stewie let him go, but Stewie refuses, knowing he could try to turn him/her in to the police and tell them s/he kidnapped him, held him hostage, and [[fondling|fondled]] him in his sleep, which Paul did not know originally. Paul's ultimate fate is left ambiguous as the story ends with a ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]''-style credits roll.\n\nBack in Peter's study, Peter begins to describe the iconic sequence in ''[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]'' in which [[Danny Torrance]] steers his tricycle through the halls, asking \"Can't you see Stewie doing that?\" but tricks the audience by finishing with \"Well, here's the Shawshank Redemption\".\n\n===''[[Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption|The Shawshank Redemption]]''===\nAndy Dufresne ([[Peter Griffin|Peter]]) is sent to Shawshank Prison, though none of the inmates think much of him, particularly Red ([[Cleveland Brown|Cleveland]], who narrates the story). A month passes before Andy literally says two words to Red (\"Vagina boob\"), and later asks him for a rock hammer, claiming he carves ''[[Star Wars]]'' figurines out of stone. He also suggests in a poorly veiled manner that he will use the hammer to tunnel out of the prison. Andy and Red end up becoming fast friends, and Red provides him with the rock hammer. One day, the prison's stern warden Samuel Norton ([[List of characters in Family Guy#Carter Pewterschmidt|Carter]]) takes a liking to Andy's figurines and offers to sell them so he can take all the money for himself, crippling Bogs ([[Joe Swanson|Joe]]), one of the inmates who had raped Andy in the shower, as a sign of good will (despite Andy saying that he liked him). Andy is then given permission to clean Norton's office, and, while doing so, plays a record of \"[[Hollaback Girl]]\" across the whole prison, which utterly confuses all the inmates and infuriates Norton, who calls Andy into his office and places him in [[solitary confinement]] for two months after Andy indirectly insults him.\n\nAfterward, Andy grows determined to escape from Shawshank, and informs Red that he is going to [[Zihuatanejo]] in Mexico, telling him that if he should ever get out of prison, he should go to a hayfield in [[Buxton, Maine]], and there will be a volcanic rock that would have \"no earthly business being there\", and a gift for him under it (although he admitted that his memory had been from 25 years prior and could be outdated, and a [[Walmart]] could have been built on the site, asking Red to buy some \"nice cheap pants\" instead if that is the case.) During an inspection the next day, Andy has disappeared without a trace. In a fury, Norton throws one of Andy's rocks at a suggestive poster of [[David Cassidy]] on the wall of Andy's cell, tearing a hole through Cassidy's rectum. Norton then pulls the poster off, discovering a tunnel that Andy had made his escape through the night before. Andy is then shown breaking into a sewage pipe while Norton is distracted by watching an episode of ''[[Friends (TV series)|Friends]]'', allowing him to crawl out to freedom. Sometime later, Red is brought before a [[parole board]] and complains that the concept of [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]] is just a way for the board members to make themselves feel important, and declares he will start killing people as soon as he is released; for no apparent reason, Red is put on [[parole]] anyway and released from Shawshank. Red goes to the field in Buxton with the volcanic rock to fulfill his promise to Andy, finding a box beneath the rock containing money and a postcard asking if he remembers the name of the Mexican village Andy told him about; unfortunately, to Red's annoyance, he does not. Andy is then shown preparing a boat on a beach in [[Zihuatanejo]], eagerly waiting for Red to arrive, though Red never does.\n\nAt the end of the show, Peter thanks Stephen King and says they will see him in [[court]], then tells the viewers to \"stay tuned for [[American Dad!|whatever Fox is limping to the barn with]].\"\n\n==Production==\n[[File:StephenKingGFDL.PNG|thumb|right|Writer [[Stephen King]] was approached by the ''Family Guy'' production team.]]\nIn his second episode for the season, the first being \"[[Stew-Roids]]\", the episode was written by series regular [[Alec Sulkin]], and directed by [[Dominic Bianchi]] before the conclusion of the [[Family Guy (season 7)|seventh production season]].

However, since their next meeting will be inevitable, as they live in the same neighborhood, Petey lets Ace have the body to avoid further consequences. Upon returning home, the boys go their separate ways; Joey comes to terms with being crippled and creates a new [[wheelchair rugby]] game called \"Don't-Feel-Sorry-For-Us-Ball\", Cleve grows up to marry [[Rebecca Romijn]] (who is the real-life wife of [[Jerry O'Connell]], who played the character of \"the fat kid\" in the actual film), and Quag grows up to become a famous Hollywood actor who eventually dies of a [[drug overdose]] (a reference to the fact [[River Phoenix]], who played Chris Chambers in the actual film, went the same way and the unseen adult version of Chris dies, but in a different manner), while Petey's fate becomes a mystery.\n\n===[[Misery (novel)|''Misery'']]===\nFamed writer Paul Sheldon ([[Brian Griffin|Brian]]) has just finished his latest and final installment in his series entitled ''Snuggly Jeff'', a series of children's books, in which he kills off the titular character so he can focus on more serious work, despite objections from his [[literary agent|agent]], Marcia ([[Lois Griffin|Lois]]). While driving through a snowstorm, Paul accidentally hits [[Stephen King]] with his car, causing Paul to swerve off the road and crash into a snowbank. Paul is knocked unconscious in his car, while King, thrown aside by the impact, manages to conceive and write [[Dreamcatcher (novel)|an entire novel]] in midair before hitting the ground completely unscathed.\n\nPaul is rescued by [[Annie Wilkes|Stewie Wilkes]] ([[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]]), Paul's self-proclaimed number-one fan, who takes the injured Paul to his/her remote cabin. Upon finding and reading the manuscript of Paul's latest ''Snuggly Jeff'' book, Stewie is infuriated about the main character's death and forces Paul to rewrite it and bring Snuggly Jeff back to life, holding him hostage until he manages to do so. Stewie rejects the idea of bringing Snuggly Jeff back to life with a child's wish, calling it bad storytelling and comparing it to a plot hole in the film ''[[Contact (1997 American film)|Contact]]''.\n\nAfter sending Stewie out for more paper, Paul finds several news articles in an album that imply Wilkes is actually a [[serial killer]]. Just then, the local sheriff ([[Joe Swanson|Joe]]) appears, and is surprised to find Paul there. Before he can help him, however, Stewie blows his legs off with a [[shotgun]]. The sheriff then complains that he will now have to spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair, only to be shot again and killed by Stewie. Paul finally finishes the book and demands Stewie let him go, but Stewie refuses, knowing he could try to turn him/her in to the police and tell them s/he kidnapped him, held him hostage, and [[fondling|fondled]] him in his sleep, which Paul did not know originally. Paul's ultimate fate is left ambiguous as the story ends with a ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]''-style credits roll.\n\nBack in Peter's study, Peter begins to describe the iconic sequence in ''[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]'' in which [[Danny Torrance]] steers his tricycle through the halls, asking \"Can't you see Stewie doing that?\" but tricks the audience by finishing with \"Well, here's the Shawshank Redemption\".\n\n===''[[Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption|The Shawshank Redemption]]''===\nAndy Dufresne ([[Peter Griffin|Peter]]) is sent to Shawshank Prison, though none of the inmates think much of him, particularly Red ([[Cleveland Brown|Cleveland]], who narrates the story). A month passes before Andy literally says two words to Red (\"Vagina boob\"), and later asks him for a rock hammer, claiming he carves ''[[Star Wars]]'' figurines out of stone. He also suggests in a poorly veiled manner that he will use the hammer to tunnel out of the prison. Andy and Red end up becoming fast friends, and Red provides him with the rock hammer. One day, the prison's stern warden Samuel Norton ([[List of characters in Family Guy#Carter Pewterschmidt|Carter]]) takes a liking to Andy's figurines and offers to sell them so he can take all the money for himself, crippling Bogs ([[Joe Swanson|Joe]]), one of the inmates who had raped Andy in the shower, as a sign of good will (despite Andy saying that he liked him). Andy is then given permission to clean Norton's office, and, while doing so, plays a record of \"[[Hollaback Girl]]\" across the whole prison, which utterly confuses all the inmates and infuriates Norton, who calls Andy into his office and places him in [[solitary confinement]] for two months after Andy indirectly insults him.\n\nAfterward, Andy grows determined to escape from Shawshank, and informs Red that he is going to [[Zihuatanejo]] in Mexico, telling him that if he should ever get out of prison, he should go to a hayfield in [[Buxton, Maine]], and there will be a volcanic rock that would have \"no earthly business being there\", and a gift for him under it (although he admitted that his memory had been from 25 years prior and could be outdated, and a [[Walmart]] could have been built on the site, asking Red to buy some \"nice cheap pants\" instead if that is the case.) During an inspection the next day, Andy has disappeared without a trace. In a fury, Norton throws one of Andy's rocks at a suggestive poster of [[David Cassidy]] on the wall of Andy's cell, tearing a hole through Cassidy's rectum. Norton then pulls the poster off, discovering a tunnel that Andy had made his escape through the night before. Andy is then shown breaking into a sewage pipe while Norton is distracted by watching an episode of ''[[Friends (TV series)|Friends]]'', allowing him to crawl out to freedom. Sometime later, Red is brought before a [[parole board]] and complains that the concept of [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]] is just a way for the board members to make themselves feel important, and declares he will start killing people as soon as he is released; for no apparent reason, Red is put on [[parole]] anyway and released from Shawshank. Red goes to the field in Buxton with the volcanic rock to fulfill his promise to Andy, finding a box beneath the rock containing money and a postcard asking if he remembers the name of the Mexican village Andy told him about; unfortunately, to Red's annoyance, he does not. Andy is then shown preparing a boat on a beach in [[Zihuatanejo]], eagerly waiting for Red to arrive, though Red never does.\n\nAt the end of the show, Peter thanks Stephen King and says they will see him in [[court]], then tells the viewers to \"stay tuned for [[American Dad!|whatever Fox is limping to the barn with]].\"\n\n==Production==\n[[File:StephenKingGFDL.PNG|thumb|right|Writer [[Stephen King]] was approached by the ''Family Guy'' production team.]]\nIn his second episode for the season, the first being \"[[Stew-Roids]]\", the episode was written by series regular [[Alec Sulkin]], and directed by [[Dominic Bianchi]] before the conclusion of the [[Family Guy (season 7)|seventh production season]].
