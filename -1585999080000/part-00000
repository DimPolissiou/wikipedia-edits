Massage techniques are commonly applied with hands, fingers, [[elbow]]s, [[knee]]s, [[forearm]]s, feet, or a device. The purpose of massage is generally for the treatment of body stress or pain. A person who was [[professionally]] trained to give massages was traditionally known as a '''masseur''' (male) or a '''masseuse''' (female), but those titles are outmoded{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}, and carry some negative connotations. In the United States, the title '''massage therapist''' has been recognized as a business norm for those who have been professionally trained to give massages.\n\nIn professional settings, clients are treated while lying on a [[massage table]], sitting in a [[massage chair]], or lying on a mat on the floor. In amateur settings, a general purpose surface like a bed or the floor is more common.

Later in the 11th century copies were translated back into Latin, and again in the 15th and 16th centuries, when they helped enlighten European scholars as to the achievements of the Ancient Greeks. This renewal of the Galenic tradition during the Renaissance played a very important part in the rise of modern science.\n\nOne of the greatest Persian medics was [[Avicenna]], also known as Ibn Sina, who lived from 980AD to 1037AD. His works included a comprehensive collection and systematisation of the fragmentary and unorganised Greco-Roman medical literature that had been translated Arabic by that time, augmented by notes from his own experiences. One of his books, ''Al-Q\u0101n\u016bn f\u012b a\u1e6d-\u1e6cibb'' (The Canon of Medicine) has been called the most famous single book in the history of medicine in both East and West. Avicenna excelled in the logical assessment of conditions and comparison of symptoms and took special note of analgesics and their proper use as well as other methods of relieving pain, including massage.\n\nAD 1150: Evidence of massage abortion, involving the application of pressure to the pregnant [[abdomen]], can be found in one of the [[bas relief]]s decorating the temple of [[Angkor Wat]] in [[Cambodia]].

This work has long been regarded as of cardinal importance in the history of physiotherapy because it almost certainly influenced the Swedish founder of the modern phase of the art, Per Hendrik Ling.

The technique combines [[hydrotherapy]] floating and immersion with [[shiatsu]] and other massage techniques. Watsu is used as a form of [[aquatic therapy]] for deep relaxation and other therapeutic intent. Related forms include [[Waterdance|WaterDance]], Healing Dance, and Jahara technique.<ref name=Schoedinger2011>Schoedinger, P. 2011.  Watsu in aquatic rehabilitation.

A typical commercial massage table has an easily cleaned, heavily padded surface, and a horseshoe-shaped head support that allows the client to breathe easily while lying face down and can be stationary or portable, while home versions are often lighter weight or designed to fold away easily. An [[orthopedic pillow]] or bolster can be used to correct body positioning.\n\nErgonomic chairs serve a similar function as a massage table. Chairs may be either stationary or portable models. Massage chairs are easier to transport than massage tables, and recipients do not need to disrobe to receive a chair massage. Due to these two factors, chair massage is often performed in settings such as corporate offices, outdoor festivals, shopping malls, and other public locations.\n\n=== Warm-water therapy pools ===\nTemperature-controlled warm-water therapy pools are used to perform aquatic bodywork.<ref name=Osinski2011>Osinski, A. 2011.

These tables differ from a Vichy shower in that the client usually stays dry. Two common types are one in which the client lies on a waterbed-like mattress which contains warm water and jets of water and air bubbles and one in which the client lies on a foam pad and is covered by a plastic sheet and is then sprayed by jets of warm water, similar to a Vichy shower.<ref name=\"amiaspa\">{{cite web|url=http://www.circlesoflight.com/alternative/water-jet-machine.html |title=Using a Water Massage Machine |publisher=Circlesoflight.com |date=16 March 2007 |access-date=26 February 2013}}</ref> The first type is sometimes seen available for use in malls and shopping centers for a small fee.\n\n=== Vichy showers ===\nA [[Vichy shower]] is a form of hydrotherapy which uses a series of shower nozzles which spray large quantities of water over the client while they lie in a shallow wet bed, similar to a massage table, but with drainage for the water. The nozzles may usually be adjusted for height, direction, and temperature to suit the client's needs.\n\n=== Cremes, lotions, gels, and oils ===\nMany different types of massage cremes, lotions, gels, and oils are used to lubricate and moisturize the skin and reduce the friction between skin (hands of technician and client).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Capellini|first1=Steve|last2=Welden|first2=Michel Van|title=Massage For Dummies|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9780470642757|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KgFnbJ7E90IC&pg=PA20|date=2010-05-11}}</ref>\n\n=== Massage tools ===\nThese instruments or devices are sometimes used during massages.  Some tools are for use by individuals, others by the therapist.\n\n====Tools used by massage therapists====\nInstrument-assisted soft-tissue massage can deploy stainless-steel devices to manipulate tissue in a way that augments hands-on work. \n\nA body rock is a serpentine-shaped tool, usually carved out of stone. It is used to amplify the therapist's strength and focus pressure on certain areas. It can be used directly on the skin with a lubricant such as oil or corn starch or directly over clothing.\n\n[[Bamboo massage|Bamboo]] and [[rosewood]] tools are also commonly used. They originate from practices in southeast Asia, Thailand, Cambodia, and Burma.  Some of them may be heated, oiled, or wrapped in cloth.\n\n====Tools used by both individuals and massagers====\nHand-held battery-operated massaging and vibrating instruments are available, including devices for massaging the scalp following a [[haircut]].\n\nVibrating massage pads come in a range of sizes, some with the option of heating.\n\nVibrating [[massage chair]]s can provide an alternative for therapy at home.\n\nThere is a widespread market in [[erotic massage]] instruments, including electric [[dildos]] and [[Vibrator (sex toy)|vibrators]] such as the [[massage wand]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Trout|first1=Christopher|title=The 46-year-old sex toy Hitachi won't talk about|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/08/27/history-of-the-hitachi-magic-wand/|accessdate=30 August 2014|work=[[Engadget]]|date=28 August 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140827183517/http://www.engadget.com/2014/08/27/history-of-the-hitachi-magic-wand/|archivedate=27 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Medical and therapeutic use ==\nThe main professionals that provide therapeutic massage are massage therapists, [[athletic trainer]]s, [[Physical therapy|physical therapists]] and practitioners of many [[traditional Chinese medicine|traditional Chinese and other eastern medicines]]. Massage practitioners work in a variety of medical settings and may travel to private residences or businesses.<ref name=nccam/> [[Contraindication]]s to massage include [[deep vein thrombosis]], [[bleeding disorders]] or taking blood thinners such as [[Warfarin]], damaged blood vessels, weakened bones from [[cancer]], [[osteoporosis]], or [[fractures]], and [[fever]].<ref name=nccam/>\n\n=== Practitioner associations and official recognition of professionals ===\nThe US based National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine recognizes over eighty different massage techniques.<ref name=\"nccam\"/> The most cited reasons for introducing massage as therapy have been client demand and perceived clinical effectiveness.<ref name=\"policy\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Myklebust M, Iler J | title = Policy for therapeutic massage in an academic health center: a model for standard policy development | journal = Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 471\u20135 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17532742 | doi = 10.1089/acm.2007.6323 | hdl = 2027.42/63197 | url = https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/63197/1/acm.2007.6323.pdf }}</ref>\n\n=== Associated methods ===\nMany types of practices are associated with massage and include [[Bodywork (alternative medicine)|bodywork]], [[manual therapy]], [[energy medicine]], neural mobilization and [[breathwork]]. Other names for massage and related practices include hands-on work, body/somatic therapy, and somatic movement education. Body-mind integration techniques stress self-awareness and movement over physical manipulations by a practitioner. Therapies related to movement awareness/education are closer to [[Dance therapy|dance and movement therapies]].

Only someone who has completed 3,200 hours of training (theoretical and practical) can use the professional title \"Masseur und Medizinischer Bademeister\" or Medical Masseur and Spa Therapist.  This person can prolong his training depending on the length of professional experience to a Physiotherapist (1 year to 18 months additional training).  The Masseur is trained in Classical Massage, Myofascial Massage, Exercise and Movement Therapy.  During the training they will study: Anatomy, Physiology, Pathology, Gynecology, Podiatry, Psychiatry, Psychology, Surgery, and probably most importantly Dermiatry and Orthopedics.  They are trained in [[Electrotherapy]], and Hydrotherapy.  Hydrotherapy includes: Kneipp, Wraps, underwater Massage, therapeutic washing, Sauna and Steambath.  A small part of their training will include special forms of massage which are decided by the local college, for example: Foot reflex zone massage, Thai Massage etc.  Finally a graduate is allowed to treat patients under the direction of a doctor.  He is regulated by the professional body which regulates Physiotherapists.  This includes the restriction on advertising and oath of confidentiality to clients.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n==== India ====\nIn India, massage therapy is licensed by The Department of Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) under the [[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (India)]] in March 1995. Massage therapy is based on Ayurveda, the ancient medicinal system that evolved around 600 BC. In [[ayurveda]], massage is part of a set of holistic medicinal practices, contrary to the independent massage system popular in some other systems. In Siddha, Tamil traditional medicine from south India, massage is termed as \"Thokkanam\" and is classified in to nine types, each for specific variety of disease.\n\n==== Japan ====\n[[File:Adolfo Farsari - Blind Shampoonier.JPG|thumb|Traditional Japanese blind massage]]\n{{see also|ja:\u3042\u3093\u6469\u30de\u30c3\u30b5\u30fc\u30b8\u6307\u5727\u5e2b|Anma}}\n\nIn Japan, [[shiatsu]] is regulated but oil massage and [[Thai massage]] are not.

Massage techniques are commonly applied with hands, fingers, [[elbow]]s, [[knee]]s, [[forearm]]s, feet, or a device. The purpose of massage is generally for the treatment of body stress or pain. A person who was [[professionally]] trained to give massages was traditionally known as a '''masseur''' (male) or a '''masseuse''' (female), but those titles are outmoded{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}, and carry some negative connotations. In the United States, the title '''massage therapist''' has been recognized as a business norm for those who have been professionally trained to give massages.\n\nIn professional settings, clients are treated while lying on a [[massage table]], sitting in a [[massage chair]], or lying on a mat on the floor.

Later in the 11th century copies were translated back into Latin, and again in the 15th and 16th centuries, when they helped enlighten European scholars as to the achievements of the Ancient Greeks. This renewal of the Galenic tradition during the Renaissance played a very important part in the rise of modern science.\n\nOne of the greatest Persian medics was [[Avicenna]], also known as Ibn Sina, who lived from 980AD to 1037AD. His works included a comprehensive collection and systematisation of the fragmentary and unorganised Greco-Roman medical literature that had been translated Arabic by that time, augmented by notes from his own experiences. One of his books, ''Al-Q\u0101n\u016bn f\u012b a\u1e6d-\u1e6cibb'' (The Canon of Medicine) has been called the most famous single book in the history of medicine in both East and West. Avicenna excelled in the logical assessment of conditions and comparison of symptoms and took special note of analgesics and their proper use as well as other methods of relieving pain, including massage.\n\nAD 1150: Evidence of massage abortion, involving the application of pressure to the pregnant [[abdomen]], can be found in one of the [[bas relief]]s decorating the temple of [[Angkor Wat]] in [[Cambodia]].

A typical commercial massage table has an easily cleaned, heavily padded surface, and a horseshoe-shaped head support that allows the client to breathe easily while lying face down and can be stationary or portable, while home versions are often lighter weight or designed to fold away easily. An [[orthopedic pillow]] or bolster can be used to correct body positioning.\n\nErgonomic chairs serve a similar function as a massage table. Chairs may be either stationary or portable models. Massage chairs are easier to transport than massage tables, and recipients do not need to disrobe to receive a chair massage. Due to these two factors, chair massage is often performed in settings such as corporate offices, outdoor festivals, shopping malls, and other public locations.\n\n=== Warm-water therapy pools ===\nTemperature-controlled warm-water therapy pools are used to perform aquatic bodywork.<ref name=Osinski2011>Osinski, A. 2011.

These tables differ from a Vichy shower in that the client usually stays dry. Two common types are one in which the client lies on a waterbed-like mattress which contains warm water and jets of water and air bubbles and one in which the client lies on a foam pad and is covered by a plastic sheet and is then sprayed by jets of warm water, similar to a Vichy shower.<ref name=\"amiaspa\">{{cite web|url=http://www.circlesoflight.com/alternative/water-jet-machine.html |title=Using a Water Massage Machine |publisher=Circlesoflight.com |date=16 March 2007 |access-date=26 February 2013}}</ref> The first type is sometimes seen available for use in malls and shopping centers for a small fee.\n\n=== Vichy showers ===\nA [[Vichy shower]] is a form of hydrotherapy which uses a series of shower nozzles which spray large quantities of water over the client while they lie in a shallow wet bed, similar to a massage table, but with drainage for the water. The nozzles may usually be adjusted for height, direction, and temperature to suit the client's needs.\n\n=== Cremes, lotions, gels, and oils ===\nMany different types of massage cremes, lotions, gels, and oils are used to lubricate and moisturize the skin and reduce the friction between skin (hands of technician and client).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Capellini|first1=Steve|last2=Welden|first2=Michel Van|title=Massage For Dummies|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9780470642757|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KgFnbJ7E90IC&pg=PA20|date=2010-05-11}}</ref>\n\n=== Massage tools ===\nThese instruments or devices are sometimes used during massages.  Some tools are for use by individuals, others by the therapist.\n\n====Tools used by massage therapists====\nInstrument-assisted soft-tissue massage can deploy stainless-steel devices to manipulate tissue in a way that augments hands-on work. \n\nA body rock is a serpentine-shaped tool, usually carved out of stone. It is used to amplify the therapist's strength and focus pressure on certain areas. It can be used directly on the skin with a lubricant such as oil or corn starch or directly over clothing.\n\n[[Bamboo massage|Bamboo]] and [[rosewood]] tools are also commonly used. They originate from practices in southeast Asia, Thailand, Cambodia, and Burma.  Some of them may be heated, oiled, or wrapped in cloth.\n\n====Tools used by both individuals and massagers====\nHand-held battery-operated massaging and vibrating instruments are available, including devices for massaging the scalp following a [[haircut]].\n\nVibrating massage pads come in a range of sizes, some with the option of heating.\n\nVibrating [[massage chair]]s can provide an alternative for therapy at home.\n\nThere is a widespread market in [[erotic massage]] instruments, including electric [[dildos]] and [[Vibrator (sex toy)|vibrators]] such as the [[massage wand]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Trout|first1=Christopher|title=The 46-year-old sex toy Hitachi won't talk about|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/08/27/history-of-the-hitachi-magic-wand/|accessdate=30 August 2014|work=[[Engadget]]|date=28 August 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140827183517/http://www.engadget.com/2014/08/27/history-of-the-hitachi-magic-wand/|archivedate=27 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Medical and therapeutic use ==\nThe main professionals that provide therapeutic massage are massage therapists, [[athletic trainer]]s, [[Physical therapy|physical therapists]] and practitioners of many [[traditional Chinese medicine|traditional Chinese and other eastern medicines]].

Massage therapists may obtain a certification with one of various associations operating. There is the Professional Association of Specialized Massage Therapists of Quebec, also named Mon R\u00e9seau Plus, which represents 6,300 massage therapists (including orthotherapists, naturotherapists and others), the Quebec Federation of massage therapists (FMQ), and the Association qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise des th\u00e9rapeutes naturels; however, none of these are regulated by provincial law.\n\nCanadian educational institutions are undergoing a formal accreditation process through the Canadian Massage Therapy Council for Accreditation (CMTCA).\n\n==== China ====\nMost types of massage, with the exception of some [[traditional Chinese medicine]] are not regulated in China. Although illegal in China, some of the smaller businesses are fronts for prostitution. J.K., anti-prostitution operation has established sting operations to combat the situation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gochina.about.com/od/tripplanning/a/prostitution.htm |title=About.com&nbsp;\u2014 Traveler Warning: Prostitution in China |publisher=Gochina.about.com |date=10 April 2012 |access-date=26 February 2013}}</ref> These are called [[Prostitution in China#Types and venues|falangmei]] (\u53d1\u5eca\u59b9 \"hairdressing salon sisters\").\n\n==== France ====\nFrance requires three years of study and two final exams in order to apply for a license.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;jsessionid=7F4C787EF6BFD7F0C51286E82C217E0F.tpdjo09v_1?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000020567935&categorieLien=id |title=D\u00e9cret n\u00b0 2009-494 du 29 avril 2009 relatif aux \u00e9tudes pr\u00e9paratoires et au dipl\u00f4me d'Etat de masseur-kin\u00e9sith\u00e9rapeute |language=fr |publisher=Legifrance |date= |access-date=26 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n==== Germany ====\nIn Germany massage is regulated by the government on a federal and national level.  Only someone who has completed 3,200 hours of training (theoretical and practical) can use the professional title \"Masseur und Medizinischer Bademeister\" or Medical Masseur and Spa Therapist.  This person can prolong his training depending on the length of professional experience to a Physiotherapist (1 year to 18 months additional training).  The Masseur is trained in Classical Massage, Myofascial Massage, Exercise and Movement Therapy.  During the training they will study: Anatomy, Physiology, Pathology, Gynecology, Podiatry, Psychiatry, Psychology, Surgery, and probably most importantly Dermiatry and Orthopedics.  They are trained in [[Electrotherapy]], and Hydrotherapy.  Hydrotherapy includes: Kneipp, Wraps, underwater Massage, therapeutic washing, Sauna and Steambath.  A small part of their training will include special forms of massage which are decided by the local college, for example: Foot reflex zone massage, Thai Massage etc.  Finally a graduate is allowed to treat patients under the direction of a doctor.  He is regulated by the professional body which regulates Physiotherapists.  This includes the restriction on advertising and oath of confidentiality to clients.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n==== India ====\nIn India, massage therapy is licensed by The Department of Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) under the [[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (India)]] in March 1995. Massage therapy is based on Ayurveda, the ancient medicinal system that evolved around 600 BC. In [[ayurveda]], massage is part of a set of holistic medicinal practices, contrary to the independent massage system popular in some other systems. In Siddha, Tamil traditional medicine from south India, massage is termed as \"Thokkanam\" and is classified in to nine types, each for specific variety of disease.\n\n==== Japan ====\n[[File:Adolfo Farsari - Blind Shampoonier.JPG|thumb|Traditional Japanese blind massage]]\n{{see also|ja:\u3042\u3093\u6469\u30de\u30c3\u30b5\u30fc\u30b8\u6307\u5727\u5e2b|Anma}}\n\nIn Japan, [[shiatsu]] is regulated but oil massage and [[Thai massage]] are not.

There are two levels of registration with Massage New Zealand, the professional body for massage therapists within New Zealand, although neither of these levels are government recognised.  Registration at the Certified Massage Therapist level denotes competency in the practice of relaxation massage.  Registration at the Remedial massage therapist denotes competency in the practice of remedial or orthopedic massage.  Both levels of registration are defined by agreed minimum competencies and minimum hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.massagenewzealand.org.nz/Site/membership/levels.aspx |title=Levels of Membership |publisher=Massage New Zealand |access-date=27 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==== South Africa ====\nIn South Africa, massage is regulated, but enforcement is poor.  The minimum legal requirement to be able to practice as a professional massage therapist is a 2-year diploma in Therapeutic Massage and registration with The Allied Health Professions Council of SA (AHPCSA). The 2 year qualification includes 240 credits, about 80 case studies, and about 100 hours community service.\n\n==== South Korea ====\nIn [[South Korea]],  blind and visually impaired people can become licensed masseurs.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7699114.stm | work=BBC News | title=Blind S Korea masseurs win case | date=30 October 2008 | access-date=5 April 2010}}</ref>\n\n==== Thailand ====\nIn [[Thailand]], [[Thai massage]] is officially listed as one of the branches of [[traditional Thai medicine]], recognized and regulated by the government.

who is a businessman and E.Jean Stella Fernando. She has two sisters, Mishen Prasadika and Rochelle Fiona. Dilhara studied in Negombo South International School until her GCE Ordinary Level, which she sat as a private candidate. At the age of 11 she started practicing Martial Arts, Katate-do-Shitokai, under Sensei Rohan P. Udayakumara (Black belt dan 5). During her training, she participated for several local and international Karate championships and won medals. She won the gold medal for the 2nd International Gojuryu Karate Open Championship, conducted by the International Gojuryu Karate Association (IGKA). Meanwhile, she started volunteering as an English teacher for several children homes after an incident that took place when she was 15 years old. This made her in wanting to become a humanitarian and an actress. Dilhara completed her GCE Advanced Level in Arts Stream ( English Literature, Japanese Language and IT ) at [[Newstead Girls College]] [[Negombo]]. There she was able to participate in several dramas conducted by the school drama team, that gave her the first experience in taking part in a play.

While she was visiting her uncle at the Negombo Hospital with her father, she witnessed a fight between a family and the hospital staff members about discharging a dead body. The incident caught the attention of the people around as well as hers. After about an hour when she returned with her father, she saw that one body was taken and the other was still lying. After few weeks when she revisited her uncle, she got to know from the hospital staff that nobody came to claim the other body since, so that they had buried it with government funds. \nThis occurrence made her think that even though the two dead individuals were from the same town, same country and died in the same period of time, they had two different destinies. According to Dilhara, there are people who are treated differently, neglected and marginalized in the society such as elderly, homeless people, people with disability who are being invisible to the public. She, who was also a victim of social invisibility during this period of time, decided to speak on behalf of other socially invisible individuals by looking into their needs.<ref name=\"dailynews222\"/>\n\nDilhara joined Abhina Academy conducted by the veteran actress [[Anoja Weerasinghe]]. Anoja became her first acting guru. In an interview published in ''[[Sunday Observer]]'' and ''[[Daily News (Sri Lanka)|Daily News]]'', Dilhara said that [[Anoja Weerasinghe]] taught the basic principals of acting with meditation and yoga that helped her build voice control and facial expressions. Later she joined Damayanthi Fonseka's acting Academy to study emotional balancing and character adaptation. Dilhara also studied Drama and Theatre at Abhiranga Art Centre Negombo, conducted by Randika Wimalasooriya. During this period, she got the opportunity to study Art from the Indian Theatre Director, Ujjwal Singha. Dilhara stated that Ujjwal got her through the Indian Theatre and Children's theatre that helped her to open up perspectives in overseas too.

While she was visiting her uncle at the Negombo Hospital with her father, she witnessed a fight between a family and the hospital staff members about discharging a dead body. The incident caught the attention of the people around as well as hers. After about an hour when she returned with her father, she saw that one body was taken and the other was still lying. After few weeks when she revisited her uncle, she got to know from the hospital staff that nobody came to claim the other body since, so that they had buried it with government funds. \nThis occurrence made her think that even though the two dead individuals were from the same town, same country and died in the same period of time, they had two different destinies. According to Dilhara, there are people who are treated differently, neglected and marginalized in the society such as elderly, homeless people, people with disability who are being invisible to the public. She, who was also a victim of social invisibility during this period of time, decided to speak on behalf of other socially invisible individuals by looking into their needs.<ref name=\"dailynews222\"/>\n\nDilhara joined Abhina Academy conducted by the veteran actress [[Anoja Weerasinghe]].

Compared to Naples, Genoa is one-sided. Naples has the greatest splendor alongside the greatest misery. Port life, carriage ride, high-level opera house, even a piece of Rome: the National Museum. Beside this the heavenly nature, unmatched. The sea of \u200b\u200bGenoa more imposing, but also more monotonous. Here a placid cove, framed by strange mountains and closed by characteristic islands. And all I can see from the balcony of my room. Like a giant amphitheater, the wonderful city with its intense buzz lies at my feet. On the left the old city with the docks of the port and the ancient Vesuvius, on the right the modern Villa Nazionale and Posillipo. All around the house there are gardens of fresh green, fantastic shapes and myriads of flowers. Salita del Petraio, Villa De Rosa 48, Pensione Haase, Naples, is called this fabulous panoramic lookout. The sea is wonderfully blue and calm. The city is a lively picture of clarity, facades of blocks of houses, in the light and darkness, white streets, sections of dark green parks.

India only has 4% of the world\u2019s [[fresh water]] resources despite having a population of over 1.3 billion. <ref name=\":10\">{{Cite journal|last=Dhawan|first=Vibha|date=|title=Water and Agriculture in India|url=https://www.oav.de/fileadmin/user_upload/5_Publikationen/5_Studien/170118_Study_Water_Agriculture_India.pdf|journal=Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> In addition to the disproportionate availability of freshwater, water scarcity in India primarily results from drying up of [[List of rivers of India|rivers]] and their reservoirs in the summer months right before the onset of the [[monsoons]] throughout the country. The crisis has especially worsened in the recent years due to [[climate change]] which results in delayed monsoons consequently drying out reservoirs in several regions. Other factors attributed to the shortage of water in India are a lack of proper [[infrastructure]], government oversight and [[water pollution]].\n\nThe acute shortage of water for daily needs has prompted many government and non government organisations to take stringent measures to combat the problem. The [[Government of India]] has launched multiple schemes and programs, including the formation of an entire \u2018Jal Shakti\u2019 Ministry to deal with the ongoing problem. The government has also insisted on techniques such as [[rainwater harvesting]], water conservation and more efficient [[irrigation]]. [[Agriculture]] alone is responsible for 80% of the country\u2019s water usage.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nSeveral large cities of India have experienced water shortages in recent years, with [[Chennai]] being the most prominent in 2019. The shortage of water affected the entire city of 9 million people and resulted in the closure of several hotels, restaurants and businesses. According to a report by the [[NITI Aayog|National Institution for Transforming India]](NITI Aayog), at least 21 major Indian cities, including the capital [[New Delhi]] will completely run out of groundwater by 2020. The report also noted that approximately 200,000 people die in India each year due to the lack of access to safe drinking water. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.firstpost.com/tech/science/indias-water-crisis-bengaluru-delhi-chennai-hyderabad-among-21-cities-to-run-out-of-groundwater-by-2020-4590221.html|title=Bengaluru, Delhi, Chennai among 21 cities to run out of groundwater by 2020- Technology News, Firstpost|date=25 June 2018|website=Tech2|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Impact ==\n\n=== People ===\nThe scarcity of water in India affects hundreds of millions of people across the country. A major portion of the population does not have a reliable and constant means of getting water for their daily needs. In June 2019, 65% of all reservoirs in India reported below-normal water levels, and 12% were completely dry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.news18.com/news/india/water-crisis-two-third-of-indias-reservoirs-have-below-normal-storage-maximum-are-dry-in-maha-2202279.html|title=65% of India's Reservoirs Running Dry, Maharashtra Worst Affected, Shows Water Panel's Report|website=News18|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref> Since tap water is unavailable in many cities including some megacities such as [[Chennai]], residents are reliant on alternative water sources.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Khadka|first=Navin Singh|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-49232374|title=Global report warns of Indian water crisis|date=6 August 2019|work=BBC News|access-date=3 April 2020|language=en-GB}}</ref> The country has scattered public water pumps but a lot of them are located far away from cities and their water flow is intermittent and unpredictable. A lot of Indians are forced with the option of spending money to buy drinking water but the poor sections of the society are unable to afford it on a daily basis which creates a massive problem of water scarcity for the rural population of India. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/06/28/major-indian-city-runs-out-water-million-people-pray-rain/|title=As a major Indian city runs out of water, 9 million people pray for rain|last=Masih|first=Niha|last2=AsiaEmailEmailBioBioFollowFollow|first2=closeNiha MasihForeign correspondent covering IndiaEmailEmailBioBioFollowFollowJoanna Slater closeJoanna SlaterForeign correspondent covering South|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nLimited accessibility to water is a threat to the people\u2019s health. Insufficient water has the capacity to deteriorate the health of an entire city in times of a water crisis. In the city of [[Latur]], the depletion of more than 90% of water sources resulted in a major health crisis and people were forced to dig borewells into the ground, exposing themselves to dangerous chemicals and risking contamination. Some local residents were forced to consume polluted water sources due to the crisis at hand. In June 2016, the count of health problems skyrocketed in Latur, with multiple people showing symptoms of fever, infection, dehydration, vomiting, and kidney ailments. In addition to this health crisis, hospitals were unable to safely perform any surgery due to the increased threat of post-operative infections and complications resulting from a lack of clean drinking water.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2019/jun/15/28-year-old-chennai-woman-stabbed-by-neighbour-over-water-dispute-1990355.html|title=28-year-old Chennai woman stabbed by neighbour over water dispute|website=The New Indian Express|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nA similar crisis emerged in [[2019 Chennai water crisis|Chennai in 2019]] resulting in violent incidents and protests amongst the residents of the city. In June 2019 in Chennai, a woman was stabbed by her neighbor as she attempted to dig a borewell for water. <ref name=\":9\" />\n\nIn February 2016, [[New Delhi]] was led to the brink of a severe water crisis by some [[Jat people|Jat tribe]] demonstrators who purposefully damaged the [[Munak canal]], a crucial source of water supply for the city. The protests were in retaliation to the [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]] judgement which cancelled [[Other Backward Class]] (OBC) quotas for them.\n\nThe water crisis in India was also exacerbated by the emergence of the so-called water mafia or 'tanker mafia'. Tanker mafia refers to private water tank owners who smuggle clean water illegally and sell it to local people at expensive prices. The tanker mafia is notorious in the city of [[Bhopal]], where the mafia has been reported to bully poor residents and competing businesses, creating an atmosphere of social instability.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Rajawat|first=Somya|date=21 June 2016|title=Drought and Water Security in India|url=http://www.futuredirections.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Drought-and-Water-Security-in-India.pdf|journal=Future Directions International|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Ecosystem ===\nWater scarcity also threatens the lives of wild animals across India. Wild animals are forced to infiltrate villages and cities in India as they attempt to find potable water. In 2016, the city of [[Mettur]] and [[Kolathur]] experienced an acute water shortage caused by a drought, which caused water bodies in nearby forests to dry out. Eventually, local wild animals like elephants, tigers, and spotted deers started to sneak into the cities in search of water.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/Wild-animals-hit-by-water-scarcity/article16906373.ece|title=Wild animals hit by water scarcity|date=19 December 2016|work=The Hindu|access-date=3 April 2020|others=Special Correspondent|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}</ref>Some of these animals pose a threat to the citizens, as they can attack people. Some animals like spotted deers get physically attacked by dogs in the process, or they wind up injured or dead in accidents. In the [[Madurai]] district, the acute water shortage caused Indian gaurs to die by falling into wells as they looked for water. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/Water-scarcity-leading-Indian-gaurs-to-death-traps/articleshow/20980502.cms|title=Water scarcity leading Indian gaurs to death traps |date=9 July 2013|first=J. |last=Arockiaraj  |agency=TNN |website=The Times of India|language=en|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Agriculture ===\nWater is essential to the popular occupation of [[agriculture in India]]. Farmers are unable to produce crops in the absence of water. The drought in 2019 even destroyed the supplementary crops in addition to the winter crops. The scarcity of water has rendered a lot of valuable farmland in India completely useless and much of the farming industry in these regions has ceased to operate. In 2016, the city of [[Latur]] witnessed mass unemployment, where about half of its workforce was threatened to be unemployed as the agricultural industry struggled. Much of the local economy and farming regions nearly collapsed as the citizens were left with no choice but to use the polluted water. This implied reduced job opportunities in rural areas, which pushed citizens to move to the cities in search of jobs. Such a trend only adds pressure to the already strained infrastructure as the demand for water in large cities continues to increase.<ref name=\":02\" /><br />\n\n== Reasons for scarcity ==\n\n=== Climate change ===\n[[Monsoon]]<nowiki/>is defined as a seasonal reversing wind accompanied by corresponding changes in precipitation. The North-East monsoon is responsible for 10%-20% rainfall of the total rainfall in India, while the South-West monsoon provides approximately 80% of rainfall. Therefore, the effects of climate change on the monsoon seasons is one of the important reasons for decrease in rainfall and water shortage in India. In recent years, monsoons in India have become more sporadic while also reducing in their length and hence reducing the total precipitation. <ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://impakter.com/water-scarcity-how-climate-crisis-is-unfolding-in-india/|title=Water Scarcity: How Climate Crisis is Unfolding in India|date=18 September 2019|website=Impakter|language=en-US|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, the North-East monsoon decreased by 44% and the South-West monsoon was deficient by 10%. <ref name=\":1\" /> The summer South-West monsoon that usually results in rainfall from the months of June till September was delayed for 10 days, causing the rainfall in the area to decrease by 36 percent in comparison to the 50-year average. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/145242/water-shortages-in-india|title=Water Shortages in India|date=27 June 2019|website=earthobservatory.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref> Because of the lower rainfall, water levels in reservoirs across the country decreased and led to extreme shortages of water in many major cities of India. During the first half year of 2019, 91 major reservoirs in the country recorded a 32% drop in their water capacity, resulting in disasters such as the [[2019 Chennai water crisis|Chennai Water Crisis]]\n\n=== Infrastructure issues ===\n\n==== River pollution ====\nDue to the lack of a long-term water management plan, many of the country\u2019s rivers either run dry or have been polluted. Although one of the most important river in India, [[Ganges|Ganga]] is also the one that is most severely polluted. <ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/Ganga-a-deadly-source-of-cancer-now-Study/articleshow/16858510.cms|title=NCRP: Ganga a deadly source of cancer now: Study {{!}} Patna News - Times of India|date=18 October 2012|first=Anirban |last=Ghosh |agency=TNN |website=The Times of India|language=en|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref> The pollution mostly results from untreated sewage from densely populated cities, industrial waste as well as due to religious ceremonies in and around the river.

The traditional techniques of irrigation are also to blame for the water crisis as they result in a majority of water loss and evaporation during the irrigation process.\n\n==== Wastage of water ====\nAccording to the Central Water Commission, even though climate change has resulted in a reduction in rainfall and thereby the water supply, the country still receives enough rainfall to meet the needs of over 1 billion people. However, India only catches only 8 percent of its annual rainfall due to poor rainwater harvesting. Due to rapid urbanisation, a lot of the ponds used to capture water have been lost due to the rising population and inefficient implementation of city planning guidelines. <ref name=\":42\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/why-india-does-not-have-enough-water-to-drink-1557669-2019-06-28|title=Why India does not have enough water to drink|location=New Delhi|date=28 June 2019|first=Prabhash K. |last=Dutta |website=India Today|language=en|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIndia has also been lacking in the treatment of [[wastewater]] for reuse.

The new ministry combines the [[Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation]] with the former [[Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation]]. The government aims that this step will prevent various departments from conflicting and overlapping with each other.

Some of the organizations such as 'FORCE' and 'Safe Water Network' are actively involved in dealing with the water crisis in India. International organisations such as 'We are Water' and [[UNICEF]] are also very active in alleviating the problems of basic water supply and sanitation in villages. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/BMIntro-1011.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=17 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317182910/http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/BMIntro-1011.pdf|access-date=3 April 2020|archive-date=17 March 2015}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite web|url=https://www.classy.org/blog/nonprofits-address-global-water-crisis/|title=12 Nonprofits That Address the Global Water Crisis|date=22 March 2016|website=Classy|language=en-US|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nMost of the non-governmental organizations work on raising social awareness and\u00a0 establishing water resources projects for the heavily affected parts of the country. \n\n==== Raising Social Awareness ====\nMost non-governmental organizations consider raising social awareness as one of their main responsibilities. They are actively involved in teaching the locals how to preserve the water resources and how to increase the water usage efficiency by installing new water gathering stations and improving their irrigation techniques. <ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wearewater.org/en-IN/our-foundation_253356|title=Our foundation|website=We Are Water|language=en-IN|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n\u2018We are Water\u2019 publishes documentary films every year broadcasting the severe water scarcity in India to raise social awareness. In its documentaries, We are Water highlights the main reasons for water scarcity in the country and how each civilian can work towards conserving water in their own homes. These documents are especially relevant in rural areas as the residents don\u2019t have direct access to government schemes.\n\n==== Establishing Water Resources Projects ====\nA lot of non-governmental organisations in India are involved in establishing water harvesting structures in rural areas. For example, villagers in Palve Budruk, near [[Ahmednagar]], developed a catchment plan covering 1,435 hectares \u2013 over 80% of the land available with support from [[UNICEF|UNICEF.]] The system consists of 3 dams, 20 canal bunds, two small percolation tanks linked to the main tank and 19 village ponds. Water stored in the percolation tank, is strictly meant for domestic use. Piped water is supplied for an hour a day in the morning, during which families are expected to fill up water for drinking and cooking. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/india/stories|title=Stories|website=www.unicef.org|language=en|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe Jal Bhagirathi Foundation is one of the most prominent non profit organisations in India dealing with the issues of water scarcity in the desert terrains of [[Rajasthan]]. The foundation has covered over 550 villages and revived more than 2000 water harvesting structures in the region <ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=http://jalbhagirathi.org/index.php|title=Home|date=4 April 2020|website=JBF|language=en|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref>. The organisation claims to harvest over 4000 million litres of water every year along with reclamation of 100+ hectares of barren land. <ref name=\":11\" />The organisation also works actively with schools in the region, providing safe water and sanitation facilities to them. The Jal Bhagirathi Foundation is also actively involved in raising awareness about water conservation and has been awarded numerous awards for its efforts.\n\n\n=== Solutions and technologies ===\n\n==== Rain Collection ====\n[[Rainwater harvesting]] is the name given to the innovative way of collecting rainwater in order to recharge the underground water. A lot of houses have built their own rainwater harvesting structures in order to be self sufficient. In [[Bangalore|Banglore]], Biome Environmental Trust and Friends of Lakes launched citizen initiatives to dig upto 1 million recharging wells and connect them to the groundwater using funnels. The nonprofit organisations expect this initiative to collect as much as 60% of the total rain water. <ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==== Desalination ====\n[[Desalination]] is a potential advanced technique to solve the problem of water shortage, especially in coastal regions. Desalination involves treating sea water to remove its salt content, making it fit for drinking. In the past decades, [[Israel]] has already developed a systematic method to desalinate the sea water into fresh water for industrial and domestic usage. India is already looking into installing desalination plants near the coastal regions to fulfil the water needs cities such as Chennai. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nationalinterest.org/feature/surviving-indias-water-crisis-92516|title=Surviving India's Water Crisis|author1=Akhil Ramesh|author2=Shenhav Ruttner|date=31 October 2019|website=The National Interest|language=en|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==== Irrigation Techniques ====\nEmploying almost 44% of India's working population, agriculture is one of the most important occupations in India. Consequently, upto 80% of the groundwater in India is used for [[irrigation]]. <ref name=\":8\" /> The Indian Agriculture Institute has been promoting the [[drip irrigation]] technology to relieve the water scarcity in India for decades. The technology has the advantage of being applicable to all kinds of terrains in the country. Furthermore, the technique helps farmers  use water more efficiently by modifying the water supply based on the moisture level of the soil. With the help of the Indian government, drip irrigation has seen a massive rise in implementation over the last 15 years. Currently, almost 3,51,000 hectares of irrigated land is under drip irrigation, compared to just 40 hectares in 1960s. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iari.res.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=200&Itemid=1247|title=Drip Irrigation Technology to save Water and Enhance Crop Yields|website=www.iari.res.in|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Current events ==\n\n=== 2019 Chennai Water Crisis ===\n{{Main|2019 Chennai water crisis}}\nIn June 2019, the Indian city of [[Chennai]] faced an acute water shortage after its 4 main water reservoirs ran completely dry.

Several restaurants and hotels in the city also shut down due to the shortage of water. Even the IT firms in the city otherwise known for its thriving IT and automobile sectors were forced to ask their employees to work from home as the crisis worsened.

The crisis has especially worsened in the recent years due to [[climate change]] which results in delayed monsoons consequently drying out reservoirs in several regions. Other factors attributed to the shortage of water in India are a lack of proper [[infrastructure]], government oversight and [[water pollution]].\n\nThe acute shortage of water for daily needs has prompted many government and non government organisations to take stringent measures to combat the problem. The [[Government of India]] has launched multiple schemes and programs, including the formation of an entire \u2018Jal Shakti\u2019 Ministry to deal with the ongoing problem. The government has also insisted on techniques such as [[rainwater harvesting]], water conservation and more efficient [[irrigation]]. [[Agriculture]] alone is responsible for 80% of the country\u2019s water usage.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nSeveral large cities of India have experienced water shortages in recent years, with [[Chennai]] being the most prominent in 2019. The shortage of water affected the entire city of 9 million people and resulted in the closure of several hotels, restaurants and businesses. According to a report by the [[NITI Aayog|National Institution for Transforming India]](NITI Aayog), at least 21 major Indian cities, including the capital [[New Delhi]] will completely run out of groundwater by 2020. The report also noted that approximately 200,000 people die in India each year due to the lack of access to safe drinking water. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.firstpost.com/tech/science/indias-water-crisis-bengaluru-delhi-chennai-hyderabad-among-21-cities-to-run-out-of-groundwater-by-2020-4590221.html|title=Bengaluru, Delhi, Chennai among 21 cities to run out of groundwater by 2020- Technology News, Firstpost|date=25 June 2018|website=Tech2|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Impact ==\n\n=== People ===\nThe scarcity of water in India affects hundreds of millions of people across the country.

A lot of Indians are forced with the option of spending money to buy drinking water but the poor sections of the society are unable to afford it on a daily basis which creates a massive problem of water scarcity for the rural population of India. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/06/28/major-indian-city-runs-out-water-million-people-pray-rain/|title=As a major Indian city runs out of water, 9 million people pray for rain|last=Masih|first=Niha|last2=AsiaEmailEmailBioBioFollowFollow|first2=closeNiha MasihForeign correspondent covering IndiaEmailEmailBioBioFollowFollowJoanna Slater closeJoanna SlaterForeign correspondent covering South|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nLimited accessibility to water is a threat to the people\u2019s health. Insufficient water has the capacity to deteriorate the health of an entire city in times of a water crisis. In the city of [[Latur]], the depletion of more than 90% of water sources resulted in a major health crisis and people were forced to dig borewells into the ground, exposing themselves to dangerous chemicals and risking contamination. Some local residents were forced to consume polluted water sources due to the crisis at hand. In June 2016, the count of health problems skyrocketed in Latur, with multiple people showing symptoms of fever, infection, dehydration, vomiting, and kidney ailments. In addition to this health crisis, hospitals were unable to safely perform any surgery due to the increased threat of post-operative infections and complications resulting from a lack of clean drinking water.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2019/jun/15/28-year-old-chennai-woman-stabbed-by-neighbour-over-water-dispute-1990355.html|title=28-year-old Chennai woman stabbed by neighbour over water dispute|website=The New Indian Express|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nA similar crisis emerged in [[2019 Chennai water crisis|Chennai in 2019]] resulting in violent incidents and protests amongst the residents of the city.

The protests were in retaliation to the [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]] judgement which cancelled [[Other Backward Class]] (OBC) quotas for them.\n\nThe water crisis in India was also exacerbated by the emergence of the so-called water mafia or 'tanker mafia'. Tanker mafia refers to private water tank owners who smuggle clean water illegally and sell it to local people at expensive prices. The tanker mafia is notorious in the city of [[Bhopal]], where the mafia has been reported to bully poor residents and competing businesses, creating an atmosphere of social instability.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Rajawat|first=Somya|date=21 June 2016|title=Drought and Water Security in India|url=http://www.futuredirections.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Drought-and-Water-Security-in-India.pdf|journal=Future Directions International|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Ecosystem ===\nWater scarcity also threatens the lives of wild animals across India. Wild animals are forced to infiltrate villages and cities in India as they attempt to find potable water. In 2016, the city of [[Mettur]] and [[Kolathur]] experienced an acute water shortage caused by a drought, which caused water bodies in nearby forests to dry out. Eventually, local wild animals like elephants, tigers, and spotted deers started to sneak into the cities in search of water.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/Wild-animals-hit-by-water-scarcity/article16906373.ece|title=Wild animals hit by water scarcity|date=19 December 2016|work=The Hindu|access-date=3 April 2020|others=Special Correspondent|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}</ref>Some of these animals pose a threat to the citizens, as they can attack people.

Farmers are unable to produce crops in the absence of water. The drought in 2019 even destroyed the supplementary crops in addition to the winter crops. The scarcity of water has rendered a lot of valuable farmland in India completely useless and much of the farming industry in these regions has ceased to operate. In 2016, the city of [[Latur]] witnessed mass unemployment, where about half of its workforce was threatened to be unemployed as the agricultural industry struggled. Much of the local economy and farming regions nearly collapsed as the citizens were left with no choice but to use the polluted water. This implied reduced job opportunities in rural areas, which pushed citizens to move to the cities in search of jobs. Such a trend only adds pressure to the already strained infrastructure as the demand for water in large cities continues to increase.<ref name=\":02\" /><br />\n\n== Reasons for scarcity ==\n\n=== Climate change ===\n[[Monsoon]]<nowiki/>is defined as a seasonal reversing wind accompanied by corresponding changes in precipitation. The North-East monsoon is responsible for 10%-20% rainfall of the total rainfall in India, while the South-West monsoon provides approximately 80% of rainfall. Therefore, the effects of climate change on the monsoon seasons is one of the important reasons for decrease in rainfall and water shortage in India. In recent years, monsoons in India have become more sporadic while also reducing in their length and hence reducing the total precipitation. <ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://impakter.com/water-scarcity-how-climate-crisis-is-unfolding-in-india/|title=Water Scarcity: How Climate Crisis is Unfolding in India|date=18 September 2019|website=Impakter|language=en-US|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, the North-East monsoon decreased by 44% and the South-West monsoon was deficient by 10%. <ref name=\":1\" /> The summer South-West monsoon that usually results in rainfall from the months of June till September was delayed for 10 days, causing the rainfall in the area to decrease by 36 percent in comparison to the 50-year average. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/145242/water-shortages-in-india|title=Water Shortages in India|date=27 June 2019|website=earthobservatory.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref> Because of the lower rainfall, water levels in reservoirs across the country decreased and led to extreme shortages of water in many major cities of India. During the first half year of 2019, 91 major reservoirs in the country recorded a 32% drop in their water capacity, resulting in disasters such as the [[2019 Chennai water crisis|Chennai Water Crisis]]\n\n=== Infrastructure issues ===\n\n==== River pollution ====\nDue to the lack of a long-term water management plan, many of the country\u2019s rivers either run dry or have been polluted. Although one of the most important river in India, [[Ganges|Ganga]] is also the one that is most severely polluted. <ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/Ganga-a-deadly-source-of-cancer-now-Study/articleshow/16858510.cms|title=NCRP: Ganga a deadly source of cancer now: Study {{!}} Patna News - Times of India|date=18 October 2012|first=Anirban |last=Ghosh |agency=TNN |website=The Times of India|language=en|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref> The pollution mostly results from untreated sewage from densely populated cities, industrial waste as well as due to religious ceremonies in and around the river.

The traditional techniques of irrigation are also to blame for the water crisis as they result in a majority of water loss and evaporation during the irrigation process.\n\n==== Wastage of water ====\nAccording to the Central Water Commission, even though climate change has resulted in a reduction in rainfall and thereby the water supply, the country still receives enough rainfall to meet the needs of over 1 billion people. However, India only catches only 8 percent of its annual rainfall due to poor rainwater harvesting. Due to rapid urbanisation, a lot of the ponds used to capture water have been lost due to the rising population and inefficient implementation of city planning guidelines. <ref name=\":42\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/why-india-does-not-have-enough-water-to-drink-1557669-2019-06-28|title=Why India does not have enough water to drink|location=New Delhi|date=28 June 2019|first=Prabhash K. |last=Dutta |website=India Today|language=en|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIndia has also been lacking in the treatment of [[wastewater]] for reuse. Approximately 80 percent of domestic wastewater is drained out as waste and ends up flowing into other water bodies which lead to salt water sources such as the [[Bay of Bengal]] and the [[Arabian Sea]]. <ref name=\":42\" />\n\n== Efforts ==\n\n=== Government efforts ===\nThe [[Government of India]] has reformed several of its departments and initiated several water supply projects in the last 3 years to respond to the country\u2019s growing water needs. <ref name=\":42\" /> The reforms include the establishment of a new ministry for water known as the Jal Shakti Ministry. The government also launched several projects in the main rivers and underground water sources. The Indian government has claimed that the new ministry and projects could increase the whole country\u2019s water use efficiency by 20% in addition to enhancing the capacity of its water reserves and protecting the currently over-exploited area.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=http://nwm.gov.in/|title=National Water Mission, Ministry of Jal Shakti, Department of Water Resources, RD & GR, Government of India|website=nwm.gov.in|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==== Establish New Ministry Through Department Reorganization ====\nIn June 2019, Indian Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] launched a new plan, \u201cPiped Water for All by 2024\u201d in order to integrate different water resources management departments together to take charge of the ground and surface water depletion. <ref name=\":42\" /> The newly formed Jal Shakti ministry is responsible for publishing the policy guideline for water resources usage, regulating and leading the water resources related projects, and dealing with the cooperation, facilitation, and negotiation of water resources both internationally and in between states. <ref name=\":6\" />\n\nPrior to the formation of the Jal Shakti ministry, water resources in India were managed by different departments under the governance of either the local state government or the union government. The new ministry combines the [[Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation]] with the former [[Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation]]. The government aims that this step will prevent various departments from conflicting and overlapping with each other. The Jal Shakti Ministry is responsible for managing the financial and technical resources, policy support and the pollution regulation deployment regarding the water resources throughout the country. <ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/water/can-ministry-of-jal-shakti-save-indian-rivers--65197|title=Can Ministry of Jal Shakti save Indian rivers?|website=www.downtoearth.org.in|language=en|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==== Ganga River Cleaning Programs ====\n[[Ganges|Ganga]], a popular holy river in India, feeds millions of people in [[North India]]. Despite the heavy reliance of public life on the river, it was named as one of the 10 most dangerous rivers in the world in 2007 due to [[water pollution]]. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/us-tv-host-takes-dig-at-ganges_587747.html|title=US TV host takes dig at Ganges|date=16 December 2009|website=Zee News|language=en|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe first Ganga river cleaning program ([[Ganga Action Plan]]) was started in 1985 with an aim to tackle the problem of excessive water pollution in the river. The program was gradually expanded to look after the other rivers in India as well. Over the past 20 years, over \u00a3100m has been spent to mitigate the effect of industrial pollution on rivers and other water bodies. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/edit-page/Clean-Up-Or-Perish/articleshow/5699070.cms|title=Clean Up Or Perish - Times of India|website=The Times of India|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref> However, the Ganga Action Plan has not shown any signfificant results over the years. In 2018, the [[Central Pollution Control Board]] and National Green Tribunal of India reported that only 7% of the water region in Ganga River is drinkable and only about 10% of the water can be used for bathing.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nTo combat the problem of government incompetence in solving the water crisis, the Modi government announced that it will be launching new projects with more investment along with formulating new policies to manage the pollution in Ganga and other rivers in India. <ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2015/03/23/india-the-national-ganga-river-basin-project|title=The National Ganga River Basin Project|website=World Bank|language=en|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deccanherald.com/national/namami-gange-improved-water-quality-of-ganga-amit-shah-813327.html|title='Namami Gange' improved water quality of Ganga: Amit Shah|date=13 March 2020|website=Deccan Herald|language=en|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Non-governmental efforts ===\nIndia has a huge number of Non Government Organisations that focus on solving water shortage problems for the citizens in affected areas. Some of the organizations such as 'FORCE' and 'Safe Water Network' are actively involved in dealing with the water crisis in India. International organisations such as 'We are Water' and [[UNICEF]] are also very active in alleviating the problems of basic water supply and sanitation in villages. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/BMIntro-1011.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=17 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317182910/http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/BMIntro-1011.pdf|access-date=3 April 2020|archive-date=17 March 2015}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite web|url=https://www.classy.org/blog/nonprofits-address-global-water-crisis/|title=12 Nonprofits That Address the Global Water Crisis|date=22 March 2016|website=Classy|language=en-US|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nMost of the non-governmental organizations work on raising social awareness and\u00a0 establishing water resources projects for the heavily affected parts of the country. \n\n==== Raising Social Awareness ====\nMost non-governmental organizations consider raising social awareness as one of their main responsibilities. They are actively involved in teaching the locals how to preserve the water resources and how to increase the water usage efficiency by installing new water gathering stations and improving their irrigation techniques. <ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wearewater.org/en-IN/our-foundation_253356|title=Our foundation|website=We Are Water|language=en-IN|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n\u2018We are Water\u2019 publishes documentary films every year broadcasting the severe water scarcity in India to raise social awareness. In its documentaries, We are Water highlights the main reasons for water scarcity in the country and how each civilian can work towards conserving water in their own homes. These documents are especially relevant in rural areas as the residents don\u2019t have direct access to government schemes.\n\n==== Establishing Water Resources Projects ====\nA lot of non-governmental organisations in India are involved in establishing water harvesting structures in rural areas. For example, villagers in Palve Budruk, near [[Ahmednagar]], developed a catchment plan covering 1,435 hectares \u2013 over 80% of the land available with support from [[UNICEF|UNICEF.]] The system consists of 3 dams, 20 canal bunds, two small percolation tanks linked to the main tank and 19 village ponds. Water stored in the percolation tank, is strictly meant for domestic use. Piped water is supplied for an hour a day in the morning, during which families are expected to fill up water for drinking and cooking. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/india/stories|title=Stories|website=www.unicef.org|language=en|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe Jal Bhagirathi Foundation is one of the most prominent non profit organisations in India dealing with the issues of water scarcity in the desert terrains of [[Rajasthan]]. The foundation has covered over 550 villages and revived more than 2000 water harvesting structures in the region <ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=http://jalbhagirathi.org/index.php|title=Home|date=4 April 2020|website=JBF|language=en|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref>. The organisation claims to harvest over 4000 million litres of water every year along with reclamation of 100+ hectares of barren land. <ref name=\":11\" />The organisation also works actively with schools in the region, providing safe water and sanitation facilities to them. The Jal Bhagirathi Foundation is also actively involved in raising awareness about water conservation and has been awarded numerous awards for its efforts.\n\n\n=== Solutions and technologies ===\n\n==== Rain Collection ====\n[[Rainwater harvesting]] is the name given to the innovative way of collecting rainwater in order to recharge the underground water. A lot of houses have built their own rainwater harvesting structures in order to be self sufficient. In [[Bangalore|Banglore]], Biome Environmental Trust and Friends of Lakes launched citizen initiatives to dig upto 1 million recharging wells and connect them to the groundwater using funnels. The nonprofit organisations expect this initiative to collect as much as 60% of the total rain water. <ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==== Desalination ====\n[[Desalination]] is a potential advanced technique to solve the problem of water shortage, especially in coastal regions. Desalination involves treating sea water to remove its salt content, making it fit for drinking. In the past decades, [[Israel]] has already developed a systematic method to desalinate the sea water into fresh water for industrial and domestic usage. India is already looking into installing desalination plants near the coastal regions to fulfil the water needs cities such as Chennai. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nationalinterest.org/feature/surviving-indias-water-crisis-92516|title=Surviving India's Water Crisis|author1=Akhil Ramesh|author2=Shenhav Ruttner|date=31 October 2019|website=The National Interest|language=en|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==== Irrigation Techniques ====\nEmploying almost 44% of India's working population, agriculture is one of the most important occupations in India. Consequently, upto 80% of the groundwater in India is used for [[irrigation]]. <ref name=\":8\" /> The Indian Agriculture Institute has been promoting the [[drip irrigation]] technology to relieve the water scarcity in India for decades. The technology has the advantage of being applicable to all kinds of terrains in the country. Furthermore, the technique helps farmers  use water more efficiently by modifying the water supply based on the moisture level of the soil. With the help of the Indian government, drip irrigation has seen a massive rise in implementation over the last 15 years. Currently, almost 3,51,000 hectares of irrigated land is under drip irrigation, compared to just 40 hectares in 1960s. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iari.res.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=200&Itemid=1247|title=Drip Irrigation Technology to save Water and Enhance Crop Yields|website=www.iari.res.in|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Current events ==\n\n=== 2019 Chennai Water Crisis ===\n{{Main|2019 Chennai water crisis}}\nIn June 2019, the Indian city of [[Chennai]] faced an acute water shortage after its 4 main water reservoirs ran completely dry. Chennai is India\u2019s 6th largest metropolis with a population of roughly 9 million people. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbur.org/onpoint/2019/08/01/india-chennai-water-shortage-crisis-infrastructure|title=Nearly 11 Million People In The Indian City Of Chennai Are Almost Out Of Water|website=www.wbur.org|language=en|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref> The dire shortage of water affected the huge population of Chennai very badly as hundreds of people waited in lines with empty water buckets for hours. Several restaurants and hotels in the city also shut down due to the shortage of water. Even the IT firms in the city otherwise known for its thriving IT and automobile sectors were forced to ask their employees to work from home as the crisis worsened. Out of the daily requirement of 830 million litres of water a day (MLD), the city was only able to provide 525 MLD. <ref>{{Cite news|first=Mohamed |last=Imranullah|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/water-supply-in-city-cut-to-525-from-830-mld-hc-told/article28023481.ece|title=Water supply in city cut to 525 MLD from 830 MLD, HC told|date=18 June 2019|work=The Hindu|access-date=3 April 2020|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}</ref> [[Chennai MetroWater Supply and Sewage Board|Chennai Metro Water]] was forced to cut short its daily water supply by 40% to deal with the ongoing crisis. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ndtv.com/tamil-nadu-news/chennais-piped-water-supply-cut-by-40-per-cent-amid-water-crisis-2044502|title=Chennai's Piped Water Supply Cut By 40 Per Cent Amid Severe Water Crisis|website=NDTV.com|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref> The government responded by sending water tankers to residential areas.

Motefiore's father was involved with railway engineering and was a driving force behind [[the Great Exhibition]]. Her mother was a daughter of George Drew, a property speculator who developed [[Caterham]].  Dora was educated by governesses and tutors and at Mrs Creswell's school at [[Brighton]]. In 1874, Dora went to Sydney to assist her brother's wife. Dora returned briefly to England, and on her return to Sydney married Jewish merchant George Barrow Montefiore, son of [[Joseph Barrow Montefiore]]. They had two children.\n\nIn 1889, her husband was lost at sea. When Montefiore learned that she had no automatic right to guardianship of her children, she became an advocate of women's rights.<ref name = \"Allen\">Allen, J.

In 1892 Montefiore left Australia and after spending several years in Paris, settled in England.\n\n==Suffragette==\nAn influence on her socialist views was from time with Julia Dawson, on the Clarion Van in the West Midlands and she continued to see the need for women to be given the right to vote, as a class issue.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.wcml.org.uk/our-collections/activists/dora-montefiore/|title=Dora Montefiore|website=WCML|language=en|access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref>\nIn 1898, Montefiore produced a book of verse ''Singings Through the Dark''. She also continued to be active in the suffrage movement, serving on the executive of [[Millicent Fawcett]]'s [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies]] and she joined the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] that had been formed by [[Emmeline Pankhurst|Emmeline]] and [[Christabel Pankhurst]]. In 1897, Montefiore proposed the formation of the [[Women's Tax Resistance League]]. In 1906, to protest lack of political representation, Montefiore refused to pay her taxes and remained barricaded in her home for six weeks. The League used this occasion as an opportunity for demonstrations and publicity:<ref>{{cite book |last=Gross|first=David M.|year=2014|title=99 Tactics of Successful Tax Resistance Campaigns|publisher=Picket Line Press|isbn=978-1490572741|pages=44,94,189}}</ref>{{quote|The house, surrounded by a wall, could be reached only through an arched doorway, which Montefiore and her maid barred against the [[bailiff]]s.

Montefiore also met Premier [[William Arthur Holman]]. In 1912 Montefiore went to South Africa and wrote about the effect of capitalism.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wcml.org.uk/our-collections/activists/dora-montefiore/|title=Dora Montefiore|website=WCML|language=en|access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref> \n\nIn October 1913, Montefiore was involved in a plan to take children from [[Dublin]] where strikes had reduced food supplies, to Britain so that the children would not suffer while the strikes continued. [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Archbishop of Dublin]] [[William Joseph Walsh]], wrote a public letter condemning the plan.<ref>[http://multitext.ucc.ie/d/Archbishop_Walsh_on_the_Save_the_Kiddies_Campaign \"Archbishop Walsh on the 'Save the Kiddies' Campaign.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120804083729/http://multitext.ucc.ie/d/Archbishop_Walsh_on_the_Save_the_Kiddies_Campaign |date=4 August 2012 }}</ref> Those involved were arrested and charged with [[kidnapping]].

Motefiore's father was involved with railway engineering and was a driving force behind [[the Great Exhibition]]. Her mother was a daughter of George Drew, a property speculator who developed [[Caterham]].  Dora was educated by governesses and tutors and at Mrs Creswell's school at [[Brighton]]. In 1874, Dora went to Sydney to assist her brother's wife. Dora returned briefly to England, and on her return to Sydney married Jewish merchant George Barrow Montefiore, son of [[Joseph Barrow Montefiore]]. They had two children.\n\nIn 1889, her husband was lost at sea. When Montefiore learned that she had no automatic right to guardianship of her children, she became an advocate of women's rights.<ref name = \"Allen\">Allen, J.

She also continued to be active in the suffrage movement, serving on the executive of [[Millicent Fawcett]]'s [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies]] and she joined the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] that had been formed by [[Emmeline Pankhurst|Emmeline]] and [[Christabel Pankhurst]]. In 1897, Montefiore proposed the formation of the [[Women's Tax Resistance League]]. In 1906, to protest lack of political representation, Montefiore refused to pay her taxes and remained barricaded in her home for six weeks.

In the case of [[M13 bacteriophage|M13 filamentous phage]] display, the DNA encoding the protein or peptide of interest is [[DNA ligase|ligated]] into the pIII or pVIII gene, encoding either the minor or major [[Protein of the viral capsid|coat protein]], respectively. [[Multiple cloning site]]s are sometimes used to ensure that the fragments are inserted in all three possible [[reading frames]] so that the [[cDNA]] fragment is [[Gene translation|translated]] in the proper frame. The phage gene and insert [[DNA hybridization|DNA hybrid]] is then inserted (a process known as \"[[transduction (genetics)|transduction]]\") into ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' bacterial cells such as TG1, SS320, ER2738, or XL1-Blue ''E. coli''. If a \"[[phagemid]]\" [[Vector (molecular biology)|vector]] is used (a simplified display construct vector) [[virus|phage particles]] will not be released from the ''E. coli'' cells until they are infected with [[Helper virus|helper phage]], which enables packaging of the phage DNA and assembly of the mature [[virus|virions]] with the relevant protein fragment as part of their outer coat on either the minor (pIII) or major (pVIII) coat protein. \nBy immobilizing a relevant DNA or protein target(s) to the surface of a [[microtiter plate]] well, a phage that displays a protein that binds to one of those targets on its surface will remain while others are removed by washing. Those that remain can be [[elution|eluted]], used to produce more phage (by [[bacteria]]l infection with helper phage) and to produce a phage mixture that is enriched with relevant (i.e. binding) phage. The repeated cycling of these steps is referred to as [[Biopanning|'panning']], in reference to the enrichment of a sample of gold by removing undesirable materials.\nPhage eluted in the final step can be used to infect a suitable bacterial host, from which the phagemids can be collected and the relevant DNA sequence excised and [[DNA sequencing|sequenced]] to identify the relevant, interacting proteins or protein fragments.\n\nThe use of a helper phage can be eliminated by using 'bacterial packaging cell line' technology.<ref name=\"pmid17088290\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Chasteen L, Ayriss J, Pavlik P, Bradbury AR | title = Eliminating helper phage from phage display | journal = Nucleic Acids Res. | volume = 34 | issue = 21 | pages = e145 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17088290 | pmc = 1693883 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkl772 }}</ref>\n\nElution can be done combining low-pH elution [[buffering agent|buffer]] with sonification, which, in addition to loosening the peptide-target interaction, also serves to detach the target molecule from the immobilization surface.

The protein displayed corresponds to the genetic sequence within the phage.\n# This phage-display library is added to the dish and after allowing the phage time to bind, the dish is washed.\n# Phage-displaying proteins that interact with the target molecules remain attached to the dish, while all others are washed away.\n# Attached phage may be [[eluted]] and used to create more phage by infection of suitable bacterial hosts. The new phage constitutes an enriched mixture, containing considerably less irrelevant phage (i.e. non-binding) than were present in the initial mixture.\n# Steps 3 to 5 are optionally repeated one or more times, further enriching the phage library in binding proteins. \n# Following further bacterial-based amplification, the DNA within in the interacting phage is sequenced to identify the interacting proteins or protein fragments.\n\n== Selection of the coat protein ==\n\n=== Filamentous phages ===\n\n==== pIII ====\n\npIII is the protein that determines the infectivity of the virion. pIII is composed of three domains (N1, N2 and CT) connected by glycine-rich linkers.<ref name=\"Lowman_Clackson_2004\">{{cite book |vauthors=Lowman HB, Clackson T | title = Phage display: a practical approach | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford [Oxfordshire] | year = 2004 | pages = 10\u201311 | isbn = 978-0-19-963873-4 | chapter =  1.3 }}</ref> The N2 domain binds to the F pilus during virion infection freeing the N1 domain which then interacts with a TolA protein on the surface of the bacterium.<ref name=\"Lowman_Clackson_2004\"/> Insertions within this protein are usually added in position 249 (within a linker region between CT and N2), position 198 (within the N2 domain) and at the N-terminus (inserted between the N-terminal secretion sequence and the N-terminus of pIII).<ref name=\"Lowman_Clackson_2004\"/> However, when using the BamHI site located at position 198 one must be careful of the unpaired Cysteine residue (C201) that could cause problems during phage display if one is using a non-truncated version of pIII.<ref name=\"Lowman_Clackson_2004\"/>\n\nAn advantage of using pIII rather than pVIII is that pIII allows for monovalent display when using a phagemid (Ff-phage derived plasmid) combined with a helper phage.

In the case of [[M13 bacteriophage|M13 filamentous phage]] display, the DNA encoding the protein or peptide of interest is [[DNA ligase|ligated]] into the pIII or pVIII gene, encoding either the minor or major [[Protein of the viral capsid|coat protein]], respectively. [[Multiple cloning site]]s are sometimes used to ensure that the fragments are inserted in all three possible [[reading frames]] so that the [[cDNA]] fragment is [[Gene translation|translated]] in the proper frame. The phage gene and insert [[DNA hybridization|DNA hybrid]] is then inserted (a process known as \"[[transduction (genetics)|transduction]]\") into ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' bacterial cells such as TG1, SS320, ER2738, or XL1-Blue ''E. coli''. If a \"[[phagemid]]\" [[Vector (molecular biology)|vector]] is used (a simplified display construct vector) [[virus|phage particles]] will not be released from the ''E. coli'' cells until they are infected with [[Helper virus|helper phage]], which enables packaging of the phage DNA and assembly of the mature [[virus|virions]] with the relevant protein fragment as part of their outer coat on either the minor (pIII) or major (pVIII) coat protein. \nBy immobilizing a relevant DNA or protein target(s) to the surface of a [[microtiter plate]] well, a phage that displays a protein that binds to one of those targets on its surface will remain while others are removed by washing. Those that remain can be [[elution|eluted]], used to produce more phage (by [[bacteria]]l infection with helper phage) and to produce a phage mixture that is enriched with relevant (i.e. binding) phage. The repeated cycling of these steps is referred to as [[Biopanning|'panning']], in reference to the enrichment of a sample of gold by removing undesirable materials.\nPhage eluted in the final step can be used to infect a suitable bacterial host, from which the phagemids can be collected and the relevant DNA sequence excised and [[DNA sequencing|sequenced]] to identify the relevant, interacting proteins or protein fragments.\n\nThe use of a helper phage can be eliminated by using 'bacterial packaging cell line' technology.<ref name=\"pmid17088290\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Chasteen L, Ayriss J, Pavlik P, Bradbury AR | title = Eliminating helper phage from phage display | journal = Nucleic Acids Res. | volume = 34 | issue = 21 | pages = e145 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17088290 | pmc = 1693883 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkl772 }}</ref>\n\nElution can be done combining low-pH elution [[buffering agent|buffer]] with sonification, which, in addition to loosening the peptide-target interaction, also serves to detach the target molecule from the immobilization surface.

The protein displayed corresponds to the genetic sequence within the phage.\n# This phage-display library is added to the dish and after allowing the phage time to bind, the dish is washed.\n# Phage-displaying proteins that interact with the target molecules remain attached to the dish, while all others are washed away.\n# Attached phage may be [[eluted]] and used to create more phage by infection of suitable bacterial hosts. The new phage constitutes an enriched mixture, containing considerably less irrelevant phage (i.e. non-binding) than were present in the initial mixture.\n# Steps 3 to 5 are optionally repeated one or more times, further enriching the phage library in binding proteins. \n# Following further bacterial-based amplification, the DNA within in the interacting phage is sequenced to identify the interacting proteins or protein fragments.\n\n== Selection of the coat protein ==\n\n=== Filamentous phages ===\n\n==== pIII ====\n\npIII is the protein that determines the infectivity of the virion. pIII is composed of three domains (N1, N2 and CT) connected by glycine-rich linkers.<ref name=\"Lowman_Clackson_2004\">{{cite book |vauthors=Lowman HB, Clackson T | title = Phage display: a practical approach | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford [Oxfordshire] | year = 2004 | pages = 10\u201311 | isbn = 978-0-19-963873-4 | chapter =  1.3 }}</ref> The N2 domain binds to the F pilus during virion infection freeing the N1 domain which then interacts with a TolA protein on the surface of the bacterium.<ref name=\"Lowman_Clackson_2004\"/> Insertions within this protein are usually added in position 249 (within a linker region between CT and N2), position 198 (within the N2 domain) and at the N-terminus (inserted between the N-terminal secretion sequence and the N-terminus of pIII).<ref name=\"Lowman_Clackson_2004\"/> However, when using the BamHI site located at position 198 one must be careful of the unpaired Cysteine residue (C201) that could cause problems during phage display if one is using a non-truncated version of pIII.<ref name=\"Lowman_Clackson_2004\"/>\n\nAn advantage of using pIII rather than pVIII is that pIII allows for monovalent display when using a phagemid (Ff-phage derived plasmid) combined with a helper phage.

However, this led to the incorporation of more helper phage genomes rather than phagemid genomes. In all cases, phage display levels were lower than using pIII fusion. However, lower display might be more favorable for the selection of binders due to lower display being closer to true monovalent display.
