Laboratory findings are nonspecific.\n\nAlmost 75% of people have symptoms for less than two months before seeking medical attention. A flu-like illness, with a cough, fever, a feeling of illness (malaise), fatigue, and weight loss heralds the onset in about 40% of patients. Doctors do not find any specific abnormalities on routine laboratory tests or on a physical examination, except for the frequent presence of crackling sounds (called rales) upon auscultation with a stethoscope by the care provider. Pulmonary function tests usually show that the amount of air the lungs can hold is below normal. The amount of oxygen in the blood is often low at rest and is even lower with exercise.\n\n===Imaging===\n[[File:CT BOOP.jpg|thumb|CT scan showing cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (biopsy-proven)]]\n[[File:Chest CT with reversed halo sign.jpg|thumb|The [[reversed halo sign]] is seen in about 20% of individuals with COP.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://radiopaedia.org/articles/reversed-halo-sign-lungs|title=Reversed halo sign (lungs)|author=Radswiki|display-authors=et al|website=[[Radiopaedia]]|accessdate=2018-01-02}}</ref>]]\nThe chest x-ray is distinctive with features that appear similar to an extensive pneumonia, with both lungs showing widespread white patches. The white patches may seem to migrate from one area of the lung to another as the disease persists or progresses. [[CT scan|Computed tomography]] (CT) may be used to confirm the diagnosis. Often the findings are typical enough to allow the doctor to make a diagnosis without ordering additional tests.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zare Mehrjardi|first=Mohammad|last2=Kahkouee|first2=Shahram|last3=Pourabdollah|first3=Mihan|date=March 2017|title=Radio-pathological correlation of organizing pneumonia (OP): a pictorial review|journal=The British Journal of Radiology|volume=90|issue=1071|pages=20160723|doi=10.1259/bjr.20160723|issn=1748-880X|pmc=5601538|pmid=28106480}}</ref> To confirm the diagnosis, a doctor may perform a lung biopsy using a bronchoscope. Many times, a larger specimen is needed and must be removed surgically.\n\nPlain [[chest radiography]] shows normal [[lung volumes]], with characteristic patchy unilateral or bilateral consolidation. Small nodular opacities occur in up to 50% of patients and large nodules in 15%. On [[high resolution computed tomography]], airspace consolidation with [[air bronchogram]]s is present in more than 90% of patients, often with a lower zone predominance. A subpleural or peribronchiolar distribution is noted in up to 50% of patients. Ground glass appearance or hazy opacities associated with the consolidation are detected in most patients.\n\nPulmonary physiology is restrictive with a reduced [[DLCO|diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide]] (D<sub>L</sub>CO). Airflow limitation is uncommon; gas exchange is usually abnormal and mild [[hypoxemia]] is common. [[Bronchoscopy]] with [[bronchoalveolar lavage]] reveals up to 40% [[lymphocytes]], along with more subtle increases in [[neutrophils]] and [[eosinophils]]. In patients with typical clinical and radiographic features, a transbronchial biopsy that shows the pathologic pattern of organizing pneumonia and lacks features of an alternative diagnosis is adequate to make a tentative diagnosis and start therapy. On surgical lung biopsy, the histopathologic pattern is organizing pneumonia with preserved lung architecture; this pattern is not exclusive to COP and must be interpreted in the clinical context.\n\nHistologically, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia is characterized by the presence of polypoid plugs of loose organizing connective tissue (Masson bodies) within alveolar ducts, alveoli, and bronchioles.\n\n==Unusual presentations of organizing pneumonia==\nWhile patchy bilateral disease is typical, there are unusual variants of organizing pneumonia where it may appear as multiple nodules or masses. One rare presentation, focal organizing pneumonia, may be indistinguishable from lung cancer based on imaging alone, requiring biopsy or surgical resection to make the diagnosis.<ref>{{Cite journal | pmid = 12042959 | year = 2001| author1 = Oikonomou| first1 = A| title = Organizing pneumonia: the many morphological faces.| journal = European Radiology | volume = 12| issue = 6| pages = 1486\u201396| last2 = Hansell| first2 = DM | doi=10.1007/s00330-001-1211-3}}</ref>\n\n==Complications==\nRare cases of COP have induced with lobar cicatricial [[atelectasis]].<ref>{{Cite journal | pmid = 11481825| year = 2001| author1 = Yoshida| first1 = K| title = Atelectasis of the right lower lobe in association with bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia| journal = Nihon Kokyuki Gakkai zasshi = the journal of the Japanese Respiratory Society| volume = 39| issue = 4| pages = 260\u20135| last2 = Nakajima| first2 = M| last3 = Niki| first3 = Y| last4 = Matsushima| first4 = T}}</ref>\n\n==Treatment==\nMost patients recover with [[corticosteroid]] therapy.<ref name=\"pmid15942294\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Oymak FS, Demirba\u015f HM, Mavili E |title=Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia.

Laboratory findings are nonspecific.\n\nAlmost 75% of people have symptoms for less than two months before seeking medical attention. A flu-like illness, with a cough, fever, a feeling of illness (malaise), fatigue, and weight loss heralds the onset in about 40% of patients. Doctors do not find any specific abnormalities on routine laboratory tests or on a physical examination, except for the frequent presence of crackling sounds (called rales) upon auscultation with a stethoscope by the care provider. Pulmonary function tests usually show that the amount of air the lungs can hold is below normal. The amount of oxygen in the blood is often low at rest and is even lower with exercise.\n\n===Imaging===\n[[File:CT BOOP.jpg|thumb|CT scan showing cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (biopsy-proven)]]\n[[File:Chest CT with reversed halo sign.jpg|thumb|The [[reversed halo sign]] is seen in about 20% of individuals with COP.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://radiopaedia.org/articles/reversed-halo-sign-lungs|title=Reversed halo sign (lungs)|author=Radswiki|display-authors=et al|website=[[Radiopaedia]]|accessdate=2018-01-02}}</ref>]]\nThe chest x-ray is distinctive with features that appear similar to an extensive pneumonia, with both lungs showing widespread white patches. The white patches may seem to migrate from one area of the lung to another as the disease persists or progresses. [[CT scan|Computed tomography]] (CT) may be used to confirm the diagnosis. Often the findings are typical enough to allow the doctor to make a diagnosis without ordering additional tests.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zare Mehrjardi|first=Mohammad|last2=Kahkouee|first2=Shahram|last3=Pourabdollah|first3=Mihan|date=March 2017|title=Radio-pathological correlation of organizing pneumonia (OP): a pictorial review|journal=The British Journal of Radiology|volume=90|issue=1071|pages=20160723|doi=10.1259/bjr.20160723|issn=1748-880X|pmc=5601538|pmid=28106480}}</ref> To confirm the diagnosis, a doctor may perform a lung biopsy using a bronchoscope. Many times, a larger specimen is needed and must be removed surgically.\n\nPlain [[chest radiography]] shows normal [[lung volumes]], with characteristic patchy unilateral or bilateral consolidation. Small nodular opacities occur in up to 50% of patients and large nodules in 15%. On [[high resolution computed tomography]], airspace consolidation with [[air bronchogram]]s is present in more than 90% of patients, often with a lower zone predominance. A subpleural or peribronchiolar distribution is noted in up to 50% of patients. Ground glass appearance or hazy opacities associated with the consolidation are detected in most patients.\n\nPulmonary physiology is restrictive with a reduced [[DLCO|diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide]] (D<sub>L</sub>CO). Airflow limitation is uncommon; gas exchange is usually abnormal and mild [[hypoxemia]] is common. [[Bronchoscopy]] with [[bronchoalveolar lavage]] reveals up to 40% [[lymphocytes]], along with more subtle increases in [[neutrophils]] and [[eosinophils]]. In patients with typical clinical and radiographic features, a transbronchial biopsy that shows the pathologic pattern of organizing pneumonia and lacks features of an alternative diagnosis is adequate to make a tentative diagnosis and start therapy. On surgical lung biopsy, the histopathologic pattern is organizing pneumonia with preserved lung architecture; this pattern is not exclusive to COP and must be interpreted in the clinical context.\n\nHistologically, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia is characterized by the presence of polypoid plugs of loose organizing connective tissue (Masson bodies) within alveolar ducts, alveoli, and bronchioles.\n\n==Unusual presentations of organizing pneumonia==\nWhile patchy bilateral disease is typical, there are unusual variants of organizing pneumonia where it may appear as multiple nodules or masses. One rare presentation, focal organizing pneumonia, may be indistinguishable from lung cancer based on imaging alone, requiring biopsy or surgical resection to make the diagnosis.<ref>{{Cite journal | pmid = 12042959 | year = 2001| author1 = Oikonomou| first1 = A| title = Organizing pneumonia: the many morphological faces.| journal = European Radiology | volume = 12| issue = 6| pages = 1486\u201396| last2 = Hansell| first2 = DM | doi=10.1007/s00330-001-1211-3}}</ref>\n\n==Complications==\nRare cases of COP have induced with lobar cicatricial [[atelectasis]].<ref>{{Cite journal | pmid = 11481825| year = 2001| author1 = Yoshida| first1 = K| title = Atelectasis of the right lower lobe in association with bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia| journal = Nihon Kokyuki Gakkai zasshi = the journal of the Japanese Respiratory Society| volume = 39| issue = 4| pages = 260\u20135| last2 = Nakajima| first2 = M| last3 = Niki| first3 = Y| last4 = Matsushima| first4 = T}}</ref>\n\n==Treatment==\nMost patients recover with [[corticosteroid]] therapy.<ref name=\"pmid15942294\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Oymak FS, Demirba\u015f HM, Mavili E |title=Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia.

There he meets Valery ([[Leonid Bichevin]]), a young man who is dating his niece and has come to take her to a party. On the way back from Leninsk to Leningrad Artyom's car breaks down and he goes into an isolated farmhouse to get help. Artyom gets to talking with the farmhouse owner, Alexey ([[Aleksei Serebryakov (actor)|Aleksei Serebryakov]]). The two drink together homemade alcohol and argue about faith in God and retribution from sins, the professor defending the Soviet atheist worldview. Artyom also encounters Alexey's wife, Antonina (Natalya Akimova), as well as Sunka (Mikhail Skryabin), a Vietnamese worker working at the farm, who seems to be practically a personal slave of Alexey's, and a third stranger who is not explained at the time. Sunka finally fixes Artyom's car and the professor drives on. Being too drunk, he prefers to return to his brother.\n\nMeanwhile, Valery goes to a party by himself, since his girlfriend (Artyom's niece) needs to study. At the concert Valery meets another female student friend of his named Angelika (Agniya Kuznetsova), the daughter of a high-ranking [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] official, and they drink together. After the party, in search of more alcohol, Valery drives with her to a farm of moonshiners, which turns out to be the same farm Artyom had visited earlier. Valery tells Angelika to stay in the car while he gets the alcohol. However, instead of returning directly to the car, he gets drunk senseless with the moonshiner, Alexey. Angelika, waiting in the car, notices that she is being watched by a strange man. She gets scared, and tries to get help from Antonina, who gives the girl a shotgun and hides her in a barn. The stranger, who turns out to be a police officer Captain Zhurov ([[Aleksei Poluyan]]), enters the barn and takes away the gun. When Sunka tries to defend the girl, Zhurov murders him, then rapes the girl with a bottle (it appears that he himself is impotent). In the morning he handcuffs her, taking her to his flat in Leninsk, and keeps the girl handcuffed to a bedframe in his bedroom, watched over by his deranged alcoholic mother, while he brings local small-time criminals in to rape her, killing one after he fails to \"please\" the girl. The girl threatens that her fianc\u00e9, who is an army paratrooper, will save her. Captain Zhurov finds out, however, that her fiance had just been killed in Afghanistan. He arranges to have the zinc-lined coffin shipped to his apartment where he opens it and throws the corpse on the bed next to the screaming girl.\n\nAlexey the moonshiner is arrested for the killing of his Sunka. Captain Zhurov visits Alexey in his cell and convinces him to take the blame for the crime in return for some unexplained earlier favors. Alexey gets a visit from his wife Antonina and explains to her why he has to agree to confess. Antonina meets Artyom, the professor whose testimony might exonerate her husband, but Artyom refuses to testify since that would jeopardize his academic career. Alexey is convicted, sentenced to the death penalty, and summarily executed. Antonina takes a shotgun and goes to Zhurov's apartment, where she encounters screaming Angelica still chained to the bed next to the rotting corpses. She shoots and kills Zhurov, then walks out without attempting to help the girl. Meanwhile, Artyom enters a church and asks to be baptized. In the last scenes Valery (who escaped the entire affair unscathed and without letting anyone know that he knows anything), is shown discussing business propositions with a friend of his (the son of Artyom, Slava).

There he meets Valery ([[Leonid Bichevin]]), a young man who is dating his niece and has come to take her to a party. On the way back from Leninsk to Leningrad Artyom's car breaks down and he goes into an isolated farmhouse to get help. Artyom gets to talking with the farmhouse owner, Alexey ([[Aleksei Serebryakov (actor)|Aleksei Serebryakov]]). The two drink together homemade alcohol and argue about faith in God and retribution from sins, the professor defending the Soviet atheist worldview. Artyom also encounters Alexey's wife, Antonina (Natalya Akimova), as well as Sunka (Mikhail Skryabin), a Vietnamese worker working at the farm, who seems to be practically a personal slave of Alexey's, and a third stranger who is not explained at the time. Sunka finally fixes Artyom's car and the professor drives on. Being too drunk, he prefers to return to his brother.\n\nMeanwhile, Valery goes to a party by himself, since his girlfriend (Artyom's niece) needs to study. At the concert Valery meets another female student friend of his named Angelika (Agniya Kuznetsova), the daughter of a high-ranking [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] official, and they drink together. After the party, in search of more alcohol, Valery drives with her to a farm of moonshiners, which turns out to be the same farm Artyom had visited earlier. Valery tells Angelika to stay in the car while he gets the alcohol. However, instead of returning directly to the car, he gets drunk senseless with the moonshiner, Alexey. Angelika, waiting in the car, notices that she is being watched by a strange man. She gets scared, and tries to get help from Antonina, who gives the girl a shotgun and hides her in a barn. The stranger, who turns out to be a police officer Captain Zhurov ([[Aleksei Poluyan]]), enters the barn and takes away the gun. When Sunka tries to defend the girl, Zhurov murders him, then rapes the girl with a bottle (it appears that he himself is impotent). In the morning he handcuffs her, taking her to his flat in Leninsk, and keeps the girl handcuffed to a bedframe in his bedroom, watched over by his deranged alcoholic mother, while he brings local small-time criminals in to rape her, killing one after he fails to \"please\" the girl. The girl threatens that her fianc\u00e9, who is an army paratrooper, will save her. Captain Zhurov finds out, however, that her fiance had just been killed in Afghanistan. He arranges to have the zinc-lined coffin shipped to his apartment where he opens it and throws the corpse on the bed next to the screaming girl.\n\nAlexey the moonshiner is arrested for the killing of his Sunka. Captain Zhurov visits Alexey in his cell and convinces him to take the blame for the crime in return for some unexplained earlier favors. Alexey gets a visit from his wife Antonina and explains to her why he has to agree to confess. Antonina meets Artyom, the professor whose testimony might exonerate her husband, but Artyom refuses to testify since that would jeopardize his academic career. Alexey is convicted, sentenced to the death penalty, and summarily executed. Antonina takes a shotgun and goes to Zhurov's apartment, where she encounters screaming Angelica still chained to the bed next to the rotting corpses. She shoots and kills Zhurov, then walks out without attempting to help the girl. Meanwhile, Artyom enters a church and asks to be baptized. In the last scenes Valery (who escaped the entire affair unscathed and without letting anyone know that he knows anything), is shown discussing business propositions with a friend of his (the son of Artyom, Slava). The two are excited about the amount of money that can be made in the disintegrating country.\n\n== Filming ==\nFilming was carried out in [[Cherepovets]], Novaya Ladoga, Staraya Ladoga, [[Vyborg]] and [[Pskov]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Gl6Sr7kk?url=http://www.gruz200.ru/interview/balabanov/|title=WebCite query result|website=www.webcitation.org|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n\u00ab[[Ariel (Russian band)|Ariel]]\u00bb \u2014 In the land of magnolias ({{Lang-ru|\"\u0412 \u043a\u0440\u0430\u044e \u043c\u0430\u0433\u043d\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0439\" V krayu magnoliy}})\n\n\u00ab[[Zemlyane]]\u00bb \u2014 Grass by the Home ({{lang-ru|'''\u0422\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0443 \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0430''', Trava u doma}})\n\n\u00ab[[DK (band)|DK]] \u00bb \u2014 New turn\n\n\u00ab[[Kola Beldy]]\u00bb \u2014  I'll take you to the tundra\n\n\u00ab[[Afric Simone]]\u00bb \u2014 ''Hafanana''\n\n\u00ab\u00bb \u2014\n\n\u00ab\u00bb \u2014\n\n== Reception ==\n{{expand section|date=July 2012}}\nWally Hammond from [[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]] gave the film a mostly positive review, stating, \"Whether this superbly-acted, finely-directed, vision of hell is intended as a despairing state-of-the-nation address or a shocking spirital wake-up call is unclear;

Each episode is a different genre from horror and thriller to comedy.\n\n==Production==\nThe series received a 24-episode order and all the episodes were shot back-to-back as a cost-saving measure, and they were split into two 12-episode seasons. In a December 2018 interview, co-creator Mark Duplass revealed that the third season had already been filmed and edited, and he was writing season 4. According to Duplass, episodes of ''Room 104'' are made for \"a quarter\" of the cost typically expected for HBO series. Episodes are conceived in a \"[[think tank]]\" by the writers where they come up with dozens of ideas, and then they reach out to filmmakers that they are interested in to direct the episodes. Episodes are filmed in a \"fast and loose\" manner; for example, [[Josephine Decker]] directed her episode in two days only using an [[iPhone]]. For the editing process, directors do not receive [[Final cut privilege|final cut]], and Duplass screens the episodes to a group of 20 people who work at their company for feedback.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2018/12/room-104-season-2-best-episodes-season-3-done-hbo-1202028547/ |title=\u2018Room 104\u2019: Mark and Jay Duplass Are Saving Filmmakers By Bringing Them to Television |website=[[IndieWire]] |first=Ben |last=Travers |date=December 18, 2018 |accessdate=December 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''Room 104'' has received generally positive reviews from critics.

Each episode is a different genre from horror and thriller to comedy.\n\n==Production==\nThe series received a 24-episode order and all the episodes were shot back-to-back as a cost-saving measure, and they were split into two 12-episode seasons. In a December 2018 interview, co-creator Mark Duplass revealed that the third season had already been filmed and edited, and he was writing season 4. According to Duplass, episodes of ''Room 104'' are made for \"a quarter\" of the cost typically expected for HBO series. Episodes are conceived in a \"[[think tank]]\" by the writers where they come up with dozens of ideas, and then they reach out to filmmakers that they are interested in to direct the episodes. Episodes are filmed in a \"fast and loose\" manner; for example, [[Josephine Decker]] directed her episode in two days only using an [[iPhone]]. For the editing process, directors do not receive [[Final cut privilege|final cut]], and Duplass screens the episodes to a group of 20 people who work at their company for feedback.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2018/12/room-104-season-2-best-episodes-season-3-done-hbo-1202028547/ |title=\u2018Room 104\u2019: Mark and Jay Duplass Are Saving Filmmakers By Bringing Them to Television |website=[[IndieWire]] |first=Ben |last=Travers |date=December 18, 2018 |accessdate=December 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''Room 104'' has received generally positive reviews from critics.

In the team's third game of the [[1970 NFL season]], Phipps came off the bench to lead a 15-7 comeback victory over the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]].  However, his lone start of the year would be a 14-10 loss to the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] on November 15, 1970, as the rookie finished with 529 passing yards on the season.  The following year, Phipps threw for only 179 yards and started just one contest: a 13-7 defeat to the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] on November 14.\n\nIn 1972, Phipps again began the season on the sidelines, but became the team's starting quarterback after a disappointing 26-10 opening game loss to the [[Green Bay Packers]] on September 17.  He threw for 13 touchdowns and nearly 2,000 yards, helping the Browns reach the NFL playoffs.  In the November 13 game against the [[San Diego Chargers]], he led a last-minute drive to win the 21-17 contest. In the team's playoff clash against the undefeated [[Miami Dolphins]] on December 24, Phipps had led the team to a 14-13 fourth quarter lead, but his five interceptions helped end hopes of a possible upset.\n\nThe following year, he threw for nine touchdowns, but was intercepted 20 times.  Despite these struggles, he engineered two late-season comebacks in a win over the Steelers and a tie against the [[Kansas City Chiefs]].  However, the Browns missed the playoffs with a 7-5-2 record.  In 1974, the team collapsed with a 4-10 record, and Phipps was briefly replaced by [[Brian Sipe]] at mid-season.\n\nThe 1975 season was even more disastrous as the Browns dropped their first nine games.  However, Phipps went 23 of 36 in the team's first victory, a 35-23 win over the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] on November 23 in Cleveland. Phipps threw for a personal high of 298 yards with 2 TD passes and no interceptions.  Two other victories helped give hope for a turnaround the following season.\n\nIn the team's 1976 opener against the [[New York Jets]], Phipps started the game, but suffered a separated shoulder after being tackled by the Jets' [[Shafer Suggs]].  By the time he had recovered from the injury, Sipe had established himself as the team's new leader and Phipps' time in Cleveland was soon to come to an end.\n\nThat finish came on May 3, 1977, when Phipps was traded to the Bears for a first round draft pick in 1978, which turned out to be Hall of Fame tight end [[Ozzie Newsome]].  He saw minimal action during the [[1977 NFL season]], threw for two touchdowns (along with 10 interceptions) the next year, but saw his most extensive action in 1979.  During that year, he threw for 1,535 yards and nine touchdowns, as he battled teammates [[Bob Avellini]] and [[Vince Evans]] for playing time.\n\nPhipps threw for a pair of touchdowns in each of the next two seasons, but his limited role and the arrival of both quarterback [[Jim McMahon]] in the 1982 [[NFL draft]] and new coach [[Mike Ditka]] resulted in his release.\n\nPhipps was elected to the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in 2006.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.purduesports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/051606aah.html |title=Hall Call |access-date=2011-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426235911/http://www.purduesports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/051606aah.html |archive-date=2014-04-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cfbhof|id=2183|name=Mike Phipps}}\n\n{{Purdue Boilermakers quarterback navbox}}\n{{Browns1970DraftPicks}}\n{{Cleveland Browns starting quarterback navbox}}\n{{Chicago Bears starting quarterback navbox}}\n{{1969 NCAA Division I FBS College Football Consensus All-Americans}}\n{{Chicago Tribune Silver Football navbox}}\n{{1970 NFL Draft}}\n{{BrownsFirstPick}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Phipps, Mike}}\n[[Category:1947 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American football quarterbacks]]\n[[Category:Chicago Bears players]]\n[[Category:Cleveland Browns players]]\n[[Category:Purdue Boilermakers football players]]\n[[Category:All-American college football players]]\n[[Category:College Football Hall of Fame inductees]]\n[[Category:People from Broward County, Florida]]\n[[Category:People from Shelbyville, Indiana]]\n[[Category:Players of American football from Indiana]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|All-American college football player, professional football player, quarterback}}\n{{For|the Hall of Fame polo player|Michael Grace Phipps}}\n{{Infobox NFL player\n|image= Mike Phipps.jpg\n|caption=Phipps from 1969 Purdue yearbook\n|position=[[Quarterback]]\n|number=15\n|birth_date={{Birth date and age|1947|1|9|mf=y}}\n|birth_place=[[Shelbyville, Indiana]]\n|death_date=\n|height_ft=6\n|height_in=3\n|weight_lbs=208\n|draftyear=1970\n|draftround=1\n|draftpick=3\n|high_school=[[Columbus North High School|Columbus (IN)]]\n|college=[[Purdue Boilermakers football|Purdue]]\n|teams=\n* [[Cleveland Browns]] ([[1970 NFL season|1970]]\u2013[[1976 NFL season|1976]])\n* [[Chicago Bears]] ([[1977 NFL season|1977]]\u2013[[1981 NFL season|1981]])\n|statlabel1=[[Touchdown|TD]]\u2013[[Interception|INT]]\n|statvalue1=55\u2013108\n|statlabel2=Yards\n|statvalue2=10,506\n|statlabel3=[[Passer rating]]\n|statvalue3=52.6\n|nfl=PHI798625\n|CollegeHOF=2183\n}}\n\n'''Michael Elston Phipps''' (born January 19, 1947) is a former American college and professional [[American football|football]] player who was a [[quarterback]] in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) for twelve seasons during the 1970s and 1980s.
