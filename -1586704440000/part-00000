The story however was in a short form which was later worked on to make a film on it. Due to high budget and \"not so contemporary\" storyline, many producers stepped back from the project. It was the start of 2009 when Rajkumar Tiwari decided to make a film on the story which impressed him as being a science fiction fan.\n\nThe film started on 27 April 2009 with almost a new starcast. The film while in shooting faced a real problem as everyone in the floor was not able to adjust with the special effects and stumbled on their natural acting. Eventually the cast became habituated with the shoot and became comfortable.\n\nThe film was completed at various location of [[Kolkata]] and [[Vizag]].\nThe Director Tapan Banerjee's 6th.Film Rajdrohi.\n1) Jai Ma Hangeswari year 1980\n2) Prem Pratidan     Year 2001\n3) Idiot             year 2004\n4) Nari              Year 2005\n5) Prem              Year 2007\n6) Rajdrohi          Year 2009\n\n==Music==\nSongs are composed by [[Babul Bose]] and music will be released on [[SaReGaMa]].

Wells]]' [[The Invisible Man]]\n\n==Synopsis==\nDeep (Anshuman) gets in a fix when a laboratory test on him makes him invisible. Rest of the film shows his search for his father who invented the antidote and comes to know about many shocking secrets.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Anshuman]]\n* [[Swati Reddy|Swati]]\n* [[Manali Chakravarty Aaina]]\n* [[Arun Banerjee]]\n* [[Rajatava Dutta]]\n* [[Amit Daw]]\n\n==Crew==\n* '''Director''': [[Tapan Banerjee]]\n* '''Producer''' :[[Rajkumar Tiwary]]\n* '''Story''' : [[Avik Banerjee]]\n* '''Presenter''' :[[Sadhna Movies]]\n* '''Music Director''': [[Babul Bose]]\n* '''Cinematographer''': [[Babul Roy]]\n* '''Editor''' : [[Swapan Guha]]\n* '''Playback Singer''' : Shaan, Jaaved Ali, Mahalaxmi Iyer, Anwesha, Udit Narayan, Vinod Rathod & Asha Bhonsle\n\n==Production==\nIt was fall 2008 when the story was proposed by Avik Banerjee to director Tapan Banerjee about a man who falls in a dilemma after getting invisible. The story however was in a short form which was later worked on to make a film on it. Due to high budget and \"not so contemporary\" storyline, many producers stepped back from the project. It was the start of 2009 when Rajkumar Tiwari decided to make a film on the story which impressed him as being a science fiction fan.\n\nThe film started on 27 April 2009 with almost a new starcast. The film while in shooting faced a real problem as everyone in the floor was not able to adjust with the special effects and stumbled on their natural acting. Eventually the cast became habituated with the shoot and became comfortable.\n\nThe film was completed at various location of [[Kolkata]] and [[Vizag]].\nThe Director Tapan Banerjee's 6th.Film Rajdrohi.\n1) Jai Ma Hangeswari year 1980\n2) Prem Pratidan     Year 2001\n3) Idiot             year 2004\n4) Nari              Year 2005\n5) Prem              Year 2007\n6) Rajdrohi          Year 2009\n\n==Music==\nSongs are composed by [[Babul Bose]] and music will be released on [[SaReGaMa]]. [[Asha Bhonsle]] singing in this film after a break of 15 years.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=Chakraborty09>{{Cite news| first=Debarati | last=Chakraborty | date=31 December 2009 | title=Invisible Blow to the System | work=Kolkata Mirror | publisher=[[The Times Group]] | url=http://www.kolkatamirror.com/index.aspx?page=article&sectid=98&contentid=2009123120091231182402240be035e0f&sectxslt=&pageno=1 | accessdate=26 April 2010 }}</ref>\n}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2010}}{{Use British English|date=September 2010}}\n\n[[Category:2009 films]]\n[[Category:Indian films]]\n[[Category:Bengali-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s Bengali-language films]]\n", "name_user": "Rich Farmbrough", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences:Update date format tag and add authority control template", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajdrohi"}

This stream causes floods in the [[monsoon]] season. This stream was the source of water for the villages of this area from the ancient era along with [[water well]]s. Today, though, this historic stream is polluted with drain waters.\n\n==History==\nIn 997 CE, [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi]], took over the [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid dynasty]] empire established by his father, [[Sabuktigin|Sultan Sebuktegin]], In 1005 he conquered the [[Shahi]]s in [[Kabul]] in 1005, and followed it by the conquests of [[Punjab region]]. The [[Delhi Sultanate]] and later [[Mughal Empire]] ruled the region. The Punjab region became predominantly [[Muslim]] due to [[missionary]] [[Sufi]] saints whose [[dargah]]s dot the landscape of [[Punjab region]].\n\nAfter the decline of the [[Mughal Empire]], the [[Sikh Empire|Sikh]] invaded and occupied [[Sialkot District]]. The [[Muslim]]s faced severe restrictions during the Sikh rule. During the period of [[British Raj|British rule]], [[Sialkot District]] increased in population and importance.\n\nThe predominantly Muslim population supported [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] and [[Pakistan Movement]]. After the [[Partition of India|independence]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1947, the minority [[Hindu]]s and [[Sikh]]s [[Human migration|migrated]] to [[India]] while the [[Muslim]]s refugees from [[India]] settled down in the [[Sialkot District]].\n\n==Religion==\nThe town is predominantly [[Muslim]] with small [[Christians|Christian]] and [[Ahmadi]] minority.\n\n==Language==\n[[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] and [[Urdu]] are the basic languages of the people. The new generation also speaks English.\n\n==Calendar==\nThree calendars are often used by the villagers. Old age people are well conversant with the [[Islamic calendar]] and the [[Bikrami calendar]]. Nowadays, though, the most commonly used calendar is the [[Christian calendar]], which is also known as the [[Gregorian calendar]]. Almost all the festivals, falling in these calendars, are observed with enthusiasm.\n\n==Economy and basic professions==\nRalioke is an agriculture based village. Professions in it include:\n* Farming\n* [[Cattle]] farming\n* [[Fish farming]]\n* Poultry farms\n* [[Shoemaking|Cobbler]]\n* [[Goldsmith]]\n* [[Blacksmith]]\n* [[Carpenter]]\n* [[Watchman (law enforcement)|Watchman]]\n\n==Crops==\nWheat, rice, [[sunflower]], [[sugarcane]], [[potato]], [[tobacco]], [[Vegetable oil|Oilseeds]], [[tomato]]es, [[carrot]]s, [[spinach]], [[leaf vegetable]]s, stem vegetables, [[onion]], [[garlic]] and vegetables are major crops harvested by farmers of the village. Crops are divided into two major groups ([[Rabi crop]] and [[Kharif crop]]). Besides these, farmers keep [[Water Buffalo|buffalo]]s and cows for [[dairy products]] (e.g. [[milk]], [[butter]], [[cheese]]) and [[goat]], [[sheep]] and hens/[[duck]]s for meat and [[Egg (food)|eggs]].\n\n==Educational institutions==\nOnly one Government Primary (up to 5th class) School, which does not have a proper building, exists in the village.

This stream causes floods in the [[monsoon]] season. This stream was the source of water for the villages of this area from the ancient era along with [[water well]]s. Today, though, this historic stream is polluted with drain waters.\n\n==History==\nIn 997 CE, [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi]], took over the [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid dynasty]] empire established by his father, [[Sabuktigin|Sultan Sebuktegin]], In 1005 he conquered the [[Shahi]]s in [[Kabul]] in 1005, and followed it by the conquests of [[Punjab region]]. The [[Delhi Sultanate]] and later [[Mughal Empire]] ruled the region. The Punjab region became predominantly [[Muslim]] due to [[missionary]] [[Sufi]] saints whose [[dargah]]s dot the landscape of [[Punjab region]].\n\nAfter the decline of the [[Mughal Empire]], the [[Sikh Empire|Sikh]] invaded and occupied [[Sialkot District]]. The [[Muslim]]s faced severe restrictions during the Sikh rule. During the period of [[British Raj|British rule]], [[Sialkot District]] increased in population and importance.\n\nThe predominantly Muslim population supported [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] and [[Pakistan Movement]]. After the [[Partition of India|independence]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1947, the minority [[Hindu]]s and [[Sikh]]s [[Human migration|migrated]] to [[India]] while the [[Muslim]]s refugees from [[India]] settled down in the [[Sialkot District]].\n\n==Religion==\nThe town is predominantly [[Muslim]] with small [[Christians|Christian]] and [[Ahmadi]] minority.\n\n==Language==\n[[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] and [[Urdu]] are the basic languages of the people. The new generation also speaks English.\n\n==Calendar==\nThree calendars are often used by the villagers. Old age people are well conversant with the [[Islamic calendar]] and the [[Bikrami calendar]]. Nowadays, though, the most commonly used calendar is the [[Christian calendar]], which is also known as the [[Gregorian calendar]]. Almost all the festivals, falling in these calendars, are observed with enthusiasm.\n\n==Economy and basic professions==\nRalioke is an agriculture based village. Professions in it include:\n* Farming\n* [[Cattle]] farming\n* [[Fish farming]]\n* Poultry farms\n* [[Shoemaking|Cobbler]]\n* [[Goldsmith]]\n* [[Blacksmith]]\n* [[Carpenter]]\n* [[Watchman (law enforcement)|Watchman]]\n\n==Crops==\nWheat, rice, [[sunflower]], [[sugarcane]], [[potato]], [[tobacco]], [[Vegetable oil|Oilseeds]], [[tomato]]es, [[carrot]]s, [[spinach]], [[leaf vegetable]]s, stem vegetables, [[onion]], [[garlic]] and vegetables are major crops harvested by farmers of the village. Crops are divided into two major groups ([[Rabi crop]] and [[Kharif crop]]). Besides these, farmers keep [[Water Buffalo|buffalo]]s and cows for [[dairy products]] (e.g. [[milk]], [[butter]], [[cheese]]) and [[goat]], [[sheep]] and hens/[[duck]]s for meat and [[Egg (food)|eggs]].\n\n==Educational institutions==\nOnly one Government Primary (up to 5th class) School, which does not have a proper building, exists in the village. Children get education under the trees. For further or proper education students go to the nearby villages [[Baddoke Cheema]] and Jamke where [[Middle school|middle]] (up to 8th class) and high schools (up to 10th class) are situated.

It is a [[plucked string instrument]] similar in appearance and construction to an [[Electric guitar|electric]] or an [[acoustic guitar]], except with a longer [[neck (music)|neck]] and [[Scale length (string instruments)|scale length]], and typically four to six [[string (music)|strings]] or [[Course (music)|courses]]. Since the mid-1950s, the electric bass has largely replaced the [[double bass]] in [[popular music]]. \n\nThe four-string bass is usually tuned the same as the [[double bass]], which corresponds to pitches one [[octave]] lower than the four lowest-pitched strings of a guitar (E, A, D, and G). It is played primarily with the fingers or thumb, or [[guitar pick|striking]] with a [[plectrum|pick]]. The electric bass guitar has [[pickup (music technology)|pickups]] and must be connected to an [[Bass amplifier|amplifier and speaker]] to be loud enough to compete with other instruments.\n\n==Terminology==\nAccording to the ''New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', an \"Electric bass guitar [is] a Guitar, usually with four heavy strings tuned E<sub>1</sub>'\u2013A<sub>1</sub>'\u2013D<sub>2</sub>\u2013G<sub>2</sub>.\"{{sfn|Sadie|Tyrrell|2001|p=}} It also defines ''bass'' as \"Bass (iv).

In comparison with the large, heavy [[upright bass]], which had been the main bass instrument in popular music from the early 20th century to the 1940s, the bass guitar could be easily transported to shows. When amplified, the bass guitar was also less prone than acoustic basses to unwanted [[audio feedback]].{{sfn|Roberts|2001|p=}} The addition of [[Fret|frets]] enabled bassists to play in tune more easily than on fretless acoustic or [[electric upright bass]]es, and allowed guitarists to more easily transition to the instrument.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rogers |first1=Dave |last2=Braithwaite |first2=Laun |last3=May 13 |first3=Tim Mullally |title=1952 Fender Precision Bass |url=https://www.premierguitar.com/articles/1952_Fender_Precision_Bass |website=www.premierguitar.com |accessdate=7 January 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1953, [[Monk Montgomery]] became the first bassist to tour with the Fender bass, in [[Lionel Hampton]]'s postwar [[big band]].{{sfn|George|1998|p=91}} Montgomery was also possibly the first to record with the electric bass, on July 2, 1953, with [[the Art Farmer Septet]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bass heroes : styles, stories & secrets of 30 great bass players : from the pages of Guitar player magazine|last=Mulhern|first=Tom|date=1993|publisher=GPI Books|isbn=0-585-34936-3|location=San Francisco|pages=165|oclc=47008985}}</ref> Roy Johnson (with Lionel Hampton), and [[Shifty Henry]] (with [[Louis Jordan]] and His [[Tympany Five]]), were other early Fender bass pioneers.{{sfn|Slog|Coryat|1999|p=154}} [[Bill Black]], who played with [[Elvis Presley]], switched from upright bass to the Fender Precision Bass around 1957.{{sfn|Bacon|2010|p=}} The bass guitar was intended to appeal to guitarists as well as upright bass players, and many early pioneers of the instrument, such as [[Carol Kaye]], [[Joe Osborn]], and [[Paul McCartney]] were originally guitarists.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|p=}}\n\nAlso in 1953, [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] released the first short-scale [[violin]]-shaped electric bass, with an extendable end pin so a bassist could play it upright or horizontally. Gibson renamed the bass the [[Gibson EB-1|EB-1]] in 1958.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} In 1958, Gibson released the maple arched-top [[Gibson EB-2|EB-2]] described in the Gibson catalog as a \"hollow-body electric bass that features a Bass/Baritone pushbutton for two different tonal characteristics\".{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} In 1959, these were followed by the more conventional-looking [[Gibson EB-0|EB-0 Bass]].{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} The EB-0 was very similar to a [[Gibson SG]] in appearance (although the earliest examples have a slab-sided body shape closer to that of the double-cutaway [[Les Paul]] Special).

Alembic also pioneered the use of onboard electronics for pre-amplification and equalization.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Active electronics increase the output of the instrument, and allow more options for controlling tonal flexibility, giving the player the ability to amplify as well as to attenuate certain frequency ranges while improving the overall frequency response (including more low-register and high-register sounds). 1973 saw the UK company [[Wal (bass)|Wal]] begin production of a their own range of active basses.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} In 1974 [[Music Man (company)|Music Man]] Instruments, founded by Tom Walker, [[Forrest White]] and [[Leo Fender]], introduced the [[Music Man StingRay|StingRay]], the first widely produced bass with active (powered) electronics built into the instrument.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Basses with active electronics can include a [[preamplifier]] and [[equalizer (audio)|knobs]] for boosting and cutting the low and high frequencies.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Alembic and other high-end manufacturers, such as [[Tobias (bass guitar company)|Tobias]], began offering five-string basses, with a very low \"B\" string.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} In 1975, bassist [[Anthony Jackson (musician)|Anthony Jackson]] commissioned luthier [[Carl Thompson (luthier)|Carl Thompson]] to build a six-string bass tuned (low to high) B0, E1, A1, D2, G2, C3, adding a low B string and a high C string.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://bassmagazine.com/artists/partners-anthony-jackson-fodera-guitars |title = Partners: Anthony Jackson & Fodera Guitars}}</ref> These five- and six-string \"[[extended-range bass]]es\" would become popular with [[Session musician|session bassists]], reducing the need for re-tuning to alternate detuned configurations like \"drop D\", and also allowing the bassist to play more notes from the same fretting position with fewer shifts up and down the fingerboard, a crucial benefit for a session player [[sightreading]] [[bassline]]s at a recording session.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n=== 1980s\u2013present ===\n[[File:Steinberger bass.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Early 1980s-era Steinberger headless bass. The tuning machines are at the heel of the instrument, where the bridge is usually located.]]\nIn the 1980s, bass designers continued to explore new approaches. [[Ned Steinberger]] introduced a headless bass in 1979 and continued his innovations in the 1980s, using graphite and other new materials and (in 1984) introducing the [[TransTrem]] [[tremolo arm|tremolo bar]]. In 1982, Hans-Peter Wilfer founded [[Warwick (company)|Warwick]], to make a European bass, as the market at the time was dominated by Asian and American basses. Their first bass was the [[Streamer Bass]], which is similar to the Spector NS. In 1987, the Guild Guitar Corporation launched the fretless [[Ashbory bass]], which used silicone rubber strings and a piezoelectric pickup to achieve an \"upright bass\" sound with a short {{convert|18|in|mm|0|adj=on}} scale length. In the late 1980s, [[MTV Unplugged|MTV's \"Unplugged\"]] show, which featured bands performing with acoustic instruments, helped to popularize hollow-bodied [[acoustic bass guitar]]s amplified with [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] pickups built into the bridge of the instrument.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nDuring the 1990s, as five-string basses became more widely available and more affordable, an increasing number of bassists in genres ranging from [[heavy metal music|metal]] to [[gospel music|gospel]] began using five-string instruments for added lower range\u2014a low \"B\" string. As well, onboard battery-powered electronics such as preamplifiers and equalizer circuits, which were previously only available on expensive \"boutique\" instruments, became increasingly available on mid-priced basses. From 2000 to the 2010s, some bass manufacturers included [[digital signal processing|digital]] modelling circuits inside the instrument on more costly instruments to recreate tones and sounds from many models of basses (e.g., [[Line 6 (company)|Line 6's]] Variax bass). A modelling bass can digitally emulate the tone and sound of many famous basses, ranging from a vintage Fender Precision to a Rickenbacker. However, as with the electric guitar, traditional \"passive\" bass designs, which include only pickups, tone and volume knobs (without a preamp or other electronics) remained popular. Reissued versions of vintage instruments such as the [[Fender Precision Bass]] and [[Fender Jazz Bass]] remained popular among new instrument buyers up to the 2010s. In 2011, a 60th Anniversary P-bass was introduced by [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]], along with the re-introduction of the short-scale [[Fender Jaguar Bass]].{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n== Fretless basses ==\n[[File:Flatwound 01.JPG|thumb|right|A fretless bass with flatwound strings; markers are inlaid into the side of the fingerboard, to aid the performer in finding the correct pitch.]]\nWhile electric bass guitars are traditionally fretted instruments, fretless basses are used by some players to achieve different tones.  [[the Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] bassist [[Bill Wyman]] is sometimes identified as the first to make a fretless bass.  In 1961, he converted a used UK-built Dallas Tuxedo bass by removing the frets and filling in the slots with wood putty.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|p=}} Wyman used it to record  songs such as \"[[Paint It, Black]]\" and \"[[Mother's Little Helper]]\" in 1966.\n\nIn 1966, [[Ampeg]] introduced the AUB-1, the first production fretless bass. Fender followed with a fretless Precision Bass in 1970. Some fretless basses have \"fret line\" markers inlaid in the fingerboard as a guide, while others only use guide marks on the side of the neck. In the early 1970s, fusion-jazz bassist [[Jaco Pastorius]] coated the fingerboard of his de-fretted Fender Jazz Bass in [[epoxy resin]], allowing him to use roundwound strings for a brighter sound without damaging the fretboard.\n\n== Strings and tuning ==\n{{Main|Bass guitar tuning}}\nTraditional electric bass guitars have four strings, tuned the same as [[double bass]]es: E<sub>1</sub>\u2013A<sub>1</sub>\u2013D<sub>2</sub>\u2013G<sub>2</sub>. However, now there are many options, with five-, six-, and more string designs, with many approaches to tuning.  In addition to traditional [[flatwound]] strings, choices now include various windings and materials.\n\n== Pickups and amplification ==\n{{Main|Pickup (music technology)}}\n=== Magnetic pickups ===\n[[File:Precision Bass pickup.jpg|thumb|left|P-style, split-coil pickups]]\n\n* '''\"Precision\" pickups''' (as introduced with the Fender Precision Bass) or \"P-style\" are two [[single-coil]] pickups, each offset a small amount along the length of the body so that each half is underneath two strings. The pair is considered a single pickup, as they are wired together in a [[humbucker|humbucking]] configuration, greatly reducing noise from nearby electronic equipment and mains power. (Less common is the \"single-coil P\" pickup, as used on the original 1951 Precision bass. This is also known as the 'Vintage P' due to it being found on old vintage basses made before the invention of the split coil pickup. The \"single-coil P\" pickup is also used in the reissue and the Sting signature model.) P-style pickups are generally placed in the \"neck\" or \"middle\" position, but they are occasionally placed in the bridge position, or between two Jazz-style pickups.\n\n[[File:Jazz Style PickUps.JPG|thumb|right|Dual \"J\"-style pickups]]\n* '''\"Jazz\" pickups''' (as introduced with the Fender Jazz Bass) or \"J-style\", are wide eight-pole pickups that lie underneath all four strings. J pickups are typically [[single-coil]] designs, though there are a large number of humbucking designs. Traditionally, two of them are used, one near the bridge and another closer to the neck. As with the halves of P-pickups, the J-type pickups are wired in a humbucking manner so that, when used together, mains noise is greatly eliminated. J-type pickups tend to have a lower output and a thinner sound than P-type pickups. Many bassists combine a 'J' pickup at the bridge and a 'P' pickup at the neck and blend the two sounds.\n\n* '''Dual coil \"[[humbucker]]\"''' pickups each have two signal-producing coils. Humbuckers also produce a higher output level than single-coil pickups, though many dual-coil pickups are marketed as retrofits for single-coil designs like the J pickup and advertise a similar output and tonal character to the stock single-coils.\n\n=== Non-magnetic pickups ===\nThe use of non-magnetic pickups allows bassists to use non-ferrous strings such as nylon, brass, polyurethane and [[Ashbory bass|silicone rubber]].

It is a [[plucked string instrument]] similar in appearance and construction to an [[Electric guitar|electric]] or an [[acoustic guitar]], except with a longer [[neck (music)|neck]] and [[Scale length (string instruments)|scale length]], and typically four to six [[string (music)|strings]] or [[Course (music)|courses]]. Since the mid-1950s, the electric bass has largely replaced the [[double bass]] in [[popular music]]. \n\nThe four-string bass is usually tuned the same as the [[double bass]], which corresponds to pitches one [[octave]] lower than the four lowest-pitched strings of a guitar (E, A, D, and G). It is played primarily with the fingers or thumb, or [[guitar pick|striking]] with a [[plectrum|pick]]. The electric bass guitar has [[pickup (music technology)|pickups]] and must be connected to an [[Bass amplifier|amplifier and speaker]] to be loud enough to compete with other instruments.\n\n==Terminology==\nAccording to the ''New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', an \"Electric bass guitar [is] a Guitar, usually with four heavy strings tuned E<sub>1</sub>'\u2013A<sub>1</sub>'\u2013D<sub>2</sub>\u2013G<sub>2</sub>.\"{{sfn|Sadie|Tyrrell|2001|p=}} It also defines ''bass'' as \"Bass (iv).

Alembic also pioneered the use of onboard electronics for pre-amplification and equalization.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Active electronics increase the output of the instrument, and allow more options for controlling tonal flexibility, giving the player the ability to amplify as well as to attenuate certain frequency ranges while improving the overall frequency response (including more low-register and high-register sounds). 1973 saw the UK company [[Wal (bass)|Wal]] begin production of a their own range of active basses.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} In 1974 [[Music Man (company)|Music Man]] Instruments, founded by Tom Walker, [[Forrest White]] and [[Leo Fender]], introduced the [[Music Man StingRay|StingRay]], the first widely produced bass with active (powered) electronics built into the instrument.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Basses with active electronics can include a [[preamplifier]] and [[equalizer (audio)|knobs]] for boosting and cutting the low and high frequencies.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Alembic and other high-end manufacturers, such as [[Tobias (bass guitar company)|Tobias]], began offering five-string basses, with a very low \"B\" string.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} In 1975, bassist [[Anthony Jackson (musician)|Anthony Jackson]] commissioned luthier [[Carl Thompson (luthier)|Carl Thompson]] to build a six-string bass tuned (low to high) B0, E1, A1, D2, G2, C3, adding a low B string and a high C string.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://bassmagazine.com/artists/partners-anthony-jackson-fodera-guitars |title = Partners: Anthony Jackson & Fodera Guitars}}</ref> These five- and six-string \"[[extended-range bass]]es\" would become popular with [[Session musician|session bassists]], reducing the need for re-tuning to alternate detuned configurations like \"drop D\", and also allowing the bassist to play more notes from the same fretting position with fewer shifts up and down the fingerboard, a crucial benefit for a session player [[sightreading]] [[bassline]]s at a recording session.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n=== 1980s\u2013present ===\n[[File:Steinberger bass.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Early 1980s-era Steinberger headless bass. The tuning machines are at the heel of the instrument, where the bridge is usually located.]]\nIn the 1980s, bass designers continued to explore new approaches. [[Ned Steinberger]] introduced a headless bass in 1979 and continued his innovations in the 1980s, using graphite and other new materials and (in 1984) introducing the [[TransTrem]] [[tremolo arm|tremolo bar]]. In 1982, Hans-Peter Wilfer founded [[Warwick (company)|Warwick]], to make a European bass, as the market at the time was dominated by Asian and American basses. Their first bass was the [[Streamer Bass]], which is similar to the Spector NS. In 1987, the Guild Guitar Corporation launched the fretless [[Ashbory bass]], which used silicone rubber strings and a piezoelectric pickup to achieve an \"upright bass\" sound with a short {{convert|18|in|mm|0|adj=on}} scale length. In the late 1980s, [[MTV Unplugged|MTV's \"Unplugged\"]] show, which featured bands performing with acoustic instruments, helped to popularize hollow-bodied [[acoustic bass guitar]]s amplified with [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] pickups built into the bridge of the instrument.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nDuring the 1990s, as five-string basses became more widely available and more affordable, an increasing number of bassists in genres ranging from [[heavy metal music|metal]] to [[gospel music|gospel]] began using five-string instruments for added lower range\u2014a low \"B\" string. As well, onboard battery-powered electronics such as preamplifiers and equalizer circuits, which were previously only available on expensive \"boutique\" instruments, became increasingly available on mid-priced basses. From 2000 to the 2010s, some bass manufacturers included [[digital signal processing|digital]] modelling circuits inside the instrument on more costly instruments to recreate tones and sounds from many models of basses (e.g., [[Line 6 (company)|Line 6's]] Variax bass). A modelling bass can digitally emulate the tone and sound of many famous basses, ranging from a vintage Fender Precision to a Rickenbacker. However, as with the electric guitar, traditional \"passive\" bass designs, which include only pickups, tone and volume knobs (without a preamp or other electronics) remained popular. Reissued versions of vintage instruments such as the [[Fender Precision Bass]] and [[Fender Jazz Bass]] remained popular among new instrument buyers up to the 2010s. In 2011, a 60th Anniversary P-bass was introduced by [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]], along with the re-introduction of the short-scale [[Fender Jaguar Bass]].{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n== Fretless basses ==\n[[File:Flatwound 01.JPG|thumb|right|A fretless bass with flatwound strings; markers are inlaid into the side of the fingerboard, to aid the performer in finding the correct pitch.]]\nWhile electric bass guitars are traditionally fretted instruments, fretless basses are used by some players to achieve different tones.  [[the Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] bassist [[Bill Wyman]] is sometimes identified as the first to make a fretless bass.  In 1961, he converted a used UK-built Dallas Tuxedo bass by removing the frets and filling in the slots with wood putty.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|p=}} Wyman used it to record  songs such as \"[[Paint It, Black]]\" and \"[[Mother's Little Helper]]\" in 1966.\n\nIn 1966, [[Ampeg]] introduced the AUB-1, the first production fretless bass. Fender followed with a fretless Precision Bass in 1970. Some fretless basses have \"fret line\" markers inlaid in the fingerboard as a guide, while others only use guide marks on the side of the neck. In the early 1970s, fusion-jazz bassist [[Jaco Pastorius]] coated the fingerboard of his de-fretted Fender Jazz Bass in [[epoxy resin]], allowing him to use roundwound strings for a brighter sound without damaging the fretboard.\n\n== Strings and tuning ==\n{{Main|Bass guitar tuning}}\nTraditional electric bass guitars have four strings, tuned the same as [[double bass]]es: E<sub>1</sub>\u2013A<sub>1</sub>\u2013D<sub>2</sub>\u2013G<sub>2</sub>. However, now there are many options, with five-, six-, and more string designs, with many approaches to tuning.  In addition to traditional [[flatwound]] strings, choices now include various windings and materials.\n\n== Pickups and amplification ==\n{{Main|Pickup (music technology)}}\n=== Magnetic pickups ===\n[[File:Precision Bass pickup.jpg|thumb|left|P-style, split-coil pickups]]\n\n* '''\"Precision\" pickups''' (as introduced with the Fender Precision Bass) or \"P-style\" are two [[single-coil]] pickups, each offset a small amount along the length of the body so that each half is underneath two strings. The pair is considered a single pickup, as they are wired together in a [[humbucker|humbucking]] configuration, greatly reducing noise from nearby electronic equipment and mains power. (Less common is the \"single-coil P\" pickup, as used on the original 1951 Precision bass. This is also known as the 'Vintage P' due to it being found on old vintage basses made before the invention of the split coil pickup. The \"single-coil P\" pickup is also used in the reissue and the Sting signature model.) P-style pickups are generally placed in the \"neck\" or \"middle\" position, but they are occasionally placed in the bridge position, or between two Jazz-style pickups.\n\n[[File:Jazz Style PickUps.JPG|thumb|right|Dual \"J\"-style pickups]]\n* '''\"Jazz\" pickups''' (as introduced with the Fender Jazz Bass) or \"J-style\", are wide eight-pole pickups that lie underneath all four strings. J pickups are typically [[single-coil]] designs, though there are a large number of humbucking designs. Traditionally, two of them are used, one near the bridge and another closer to the neck. As with the halves of P-pickups, the J-type pickups are wired in a humbucking manner so that, when used together, mains noise is greatly eliminated. J-type pickups tend to have a lower output and a thinner sound than P-type pickups. Many bassists combine a 'J' pickup at the bridge and a 'P' pickup at the neck and blend the two sounds.\n\n* '''Dual coil \"[[humbucker]]\"''' pickups each have two signal-producing coils. Humbuckers also produce a higher output level than single-coil pickups, though many dual-coil pickups are marketed as retrofits for single-coil designs like the J pickup and advertise a similar output and tonal character to the stock single-coils.\n\n=== Non-magnetic pickups ===\nThe use of non-magnetic pickups allows bassists to use non-ferrous strings such as nylon, brass, polyurethane and [[Ashbory bass|silicone rubber]]. These materials produce different tones and, in the case of the polyurethane or silicone rubber strings, allow much shorter scale lengths.\n* [[piezoelectricity|Piezoelectric]] (or \"piezo\") pickups (also called \"piezo\" pickups) use a [[transducer]] to convert vibrations in the instrument's body or bridge into an electrical signal. They are typically mounted under the bridge saddle or near the bridge and produce a different tone from magnetic pickups, often similar to that of an acoustic bass. Piezo pickups are often used in acoustic bass guitars to allow for amplification without a microphone.\n* [[Pick up (music technology)#Optical|Optical pickups]] use an infrared [[LED]] to optically track the movement of the string, which allows them to reproduce low-frequency tones at high volumes without the \"hum\" or excessive resonance associated with conventional magnetic pickups. Since optical pickups do not pick up high frequencies or percussive sounds well, they are commonly paired with piezoelectric pickups to fill in the missing frequencies.\n\n[[File:Elbas.jpg|thumb|right|Bass-stack amp and speaker configuration]]\n=== Amplification and effects ===\n{{Main|Bass instrument amplification|Bass effects}}\nSimilar to the electric guitar, the typical electric bass guitar requires an external amplifier in order to be heard in performance settings. Additionally, various electronic effects, such as [[preamplifier]]s, \"stomp box\"-style pedals and signal processors are available to allow for further shaping of the sound.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Bass guitar techniques]]\n* [[Bass guitar tuning]]\n* [[List of bass guitar manufacturers]]\n* [[List of bass guitarists]]\n{{clear}}\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n===Sources===\n*{{cite book |last=Bacon |first=Tony |title=60 Years of Fender: Six Decades of the Greatest Electric Guitars |year=2010 |publisher=[[Backbeat Books]] |isbn=978-0879309664 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Bacon |first1=Tony |last2=Moorhouse |first2=Barry |year=2016 |title=The Bass Book: A Complete Illustrated History of Bass Guitars |publisher=[[Backbeat Books]] |isbn=978-1-4950-0150-5 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Black |first=J.

The music was composed by [[Vidyasagar (music director)|Vidyasagar]] with cinematography by [[Rajesh Yadav]] and editing by [[Kola Bhaskar]]. The film released on 19 September 2008.\n\nIn 2012, the film was remade in Kannada as ''Gowri Puthra'' with Akshay.<ref>https://www.nowrunning.com/movie/11115/kannada/gowri-puthra/3815/review.htm</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe movie starts with Venugopal ([[Cheran (director)|Cheran]]) meeting Ranjitha ([[Vimala Raman]]), whose parents want them to get married. During their conversation, Venu informs Ranjitha that he stammers if he gets stressed and is also undergoing treatment for psychological problems while he was at school. Ranjitha gets scared hearing this and turns down the proposal.\n\nVenu is a kindhearted person who manages his own wedding card business. He remains clear that the girl that he marries should know about his problem, and he does not want to get married to someone by hiding his problem. Venu's mother arranges to meet another girl named Vidhya ([[Remya Nambeesan]]). Vidhya agrees for the wedding despite knowing Venu's problems. However, on the day before the wedding, Vidhya's lover Ramesh ([[Vidharth]]), with whom she has broken up, comes and apologizes. Vidhya changes her mind and elopes with Ramesh, which shocks both Venu and her father Manikkavel ([[Manivannan]]).\n\nHowever, Venu cancels the wedding saying that he is not interested in marrying Vidhya, thereby hiding the truth that Vidhya has eloped with someone. Manikkavel feels proud seeing Venu and also feels bad that his daughter has missed such a kindhearted person in her life. Also, Manickavel apologizes to Venu for his daughter's behaviour and promises to find a suitable girl for Venu soon.\n\nAfter so many girls rejecting Venu due to his stammering speech problem, Gayathri ([[Karthika Adaikalam|Karthika]]) agrees to marry him. Venu also likes Gayathri, but he meets Gunasekhar ([[Nithin Sathya]]), an auto driver who claims to be Gayathri's lover. Guna describes his one side love towards Gayathri to Venu and Manickavel while travelling in his auto without knowing that Venu has come to see Gayathri. Venu meets Gayathri and tells her that Guna loves her sincerely and advises her to accept his love. Gayathri also understands this and agrees to marry Guna.\n\nOn the other hand, there is a positive love story told between a visually challenged RJ named Nedumaran ([[Pasupathy]]) and Thamizhisai ([[Gajala]]). Nedumaran anchors a radio program about the importance of facing life with a positive attitude, and Thamizhisai is a very big fan of Nedumaran's radio program. However, Thamizhisai gets shocked upon knowing that Nedumaran is visually challenged. Despite this, she feels proud of him seeing his positive attitude towards life. They become good friends, and Thamizhisai proposes to Nedumaran, which he does not accept as he fears that her family members will not allow her to marry him. He later realizes her true love, and they both get married. Venu is a friend of Nedumaran and he gets inspired seeing his positive tone in life.\n\nVenu and Manikkavel travel to Nagercoil for a business visit. Venu gets shocked to see Vidhya there leading a below poverty life. Venu leaves without informing Manikkavel to meet Vidhya and gets to know that she is pregnant and Ramesh is in jail for involving in a clash with their neighbour. Vidhya works in a small school and struggles to lead a proper life without money. Venu feels bad seeing her condition and gives some money. He also takes her to a nearby private hospital for a check-up. To his surprise, Ranjitha works as a receptionist in that hospital. Venu introduces Vidhya as his friend and requests Ranjitha to assist her during her further check-ups, and he pays the hospital expenses.\n\nAs Vidhya's delivery date approaches, Venu decides to stay in Nagercoil for a few more days until she gives birth to the child, thereby assisting with the hospital formalities. Slowly, Venu befriends Ranjitha, and the two meet frequently. Vidhya gives birth to a baby, and Venu informs this to Manikkavel, who gets furious hearing this. Manikkavel gets emotional and scolds Venu for helping someone who ditched him on the day of wedding. However, Venu convinces Manikkavel and takes him to see his daughter. Ranjitha comes to know about Venu's great character and slowly, love blossoms in her.\n\nNow, Venu and Manikkavel are set to meet a girl named Senthamarai ([[Navya Nair]]) who is a sub-inspector in Nagercoil. Venu informs this to Ranjitha, which shocks her. Ranjitha does not express her love towards Venu. Venu decides to secretly meet Senthamarai while she is on duty without informing her. Suddenly, violence erupts in the location, and Senthamarai starts hitting the protesters in order to control the crowd. She even hits Venu also without knowing that he has come to visit her. Venu feels guilty now and decides to cancel the meeting. While going back, he sees Ranjitha's house on the way. He decides to refresh there and then leave. However, Ranjitha proposes her love to Venu and apologizes for rejecting him at the very beginning not understanding his true character, which is more precious. Venu understands Ranjitha and decides to marry her.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Cheran (director)|Cheran]] as Venugopal\n* [[Pasupathy]] as Nedumaran\n* [[Nithin Sathya]] as Gunasekhar\n* [[Vimala Raman]] as Ranjitha\n* [[Remya Nambeeshan]] as Vidhya Manikkavel\n* [[Gajala]] as Thamizhisai Nedumaran\n* [[Karthika Adaikalam|Karthika]] as Gayathri\n* [[Navya Nair]] as Senthamarai\n* [[Manivannan]] as Manikkavel\n* [[Karunas]] as Murali\n* [[Vidharth (actor)|Vidharth]] as Ramesh (Vidhya's husband)\n* [[Appukutty]]\n\n==Production==\n\n===Casting===\nThe film was announced in 2007, and the photo session was held at the time of launch.<ref>[http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/34568.html \"'Raman Thediya Seethai' says, Cheran!\"].</ref> [[Gajala]] was selected as one of the leads.<ref>[http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/36624.html \"Gajala in 'Raman Thediya Seethai'\"].</ref> Kerala-based [[Remya Nambeesan]] was selected, and she joined in second schedule.<ref>[http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/malayalam/article/37063.html \"Remya joins 'Raman Thediya Seethai'\"].</ref> [[Vimala Raman]] of ''[[Poi (film)|Poi]]'',<ref>[http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/35302.html \"Vimala Raman to pair with Cheran\"].</ref> [[Karthika Adaikalam|Karthika]] of ''[[Thoothukudi]]'', and [[Navya Nair]] were selected since the story needed five heroines.
