Theoretically, humans may in the future have the capability to cultivate and harvest a number of naturally occurring sources of antimatter.<ref>{{Cite news |url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/08/110810-antimatter-belt-earth-trapped-pamela-space-science/ |title=Antimatter Found Orbiting Earth\u2014A First |first=Ker |last= Than |work= [[National Geographic News]] |date=August 10, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author1= Adriani | author2=Barbarino | author3=Bazilevskaya | author4=Bellotti | author5=Boezio | author6=Bogomolov | author7=Bongi | author8=Bonvicini | author9=Borisov | title=The discovery of geomagnetically trapped cosmic ray antiprotons | doi=10.1088/2041-8205/736/1/L1 | date=2011 | journal=The Astrophysical Journal | volume=736 | pages=L1 | issue= 29 | arxiv=1107.4882 |bibcode = 2011ApJ...736L...1H  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12158718 | work=[[BBC News]] | title= Antimatter caught streaming from thunderstorms on Earth |first=Jason|last=Palmer|date=2011-01-11|accessdate=2015-12-29}}</ref>\n* [[Renewable energy]] through converting sunlight into electricity\u2014either by using [[solar cell]]s and [[concentrating solar power]] or indirectly through [[biofuel]], [[wind power|wind]] and [[hydroelectric power]].

The transition between Kardashev scale levels could potentially represent similarly dramatic periods of social upheaval, since they entail surpassing the hard limits of the resources available in a civilization's existing territory. A common speculation<ref>{{cite journal\n | last = Dyson\n | first = Freeman\n | authorlink = Freeman Dyson\n | title = Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infrared Radiation\n | journal = Science\n | volume = 131\n | issue = 3414\n | pages = 1667\u20131668\n | date = 1960-06-03\n | url = http://www.islandone.org/LEOBiblio/SETI1.HTM\n | doi = 10.1126/science.131.3414.1667\n | accessdate = 2008-01-30\n | pmid = 17780673\n | bibcode=1960Sci...131.1667D}}</ref> suggests that the transition from Type&nbsp;0 to Type&nbsp;I might carry a strong risk of self-destruction since, in some scenarios, there would no longer be room for further expansion on the civilization's home planet, as in a [[Malthusian catastrophe]]. Excessive use of energy without adequate disposal of heat, for example, could plausibly make the planet of a civilization approaching Type&nbsp;I unsuitable to the biology of the [[human|dominant life-forms]] and their food sources. If Earth is an example, then sea temperatures in excess of {{convert|35|C|F}} would jeopardize marine life and make the cooling of mammals to temperatures suitable for their [[metabolism]] difficult if not impossible. Of course, these [[theoretical]] speculations may not become problems possibly through the applications of future [[engineering]] and [[technology]]. Also, by the time a civilization reaches Type&nbsp;I it may have colonized other planets or created [[O'Neill cylinder|O'Neill-type colonies]], so that waste heat could be distributed throughout the planetary system\n\nThe limitation of biological life-form and the evolution of computing technology may lead to the transformation of the civilization through [[Mind uploading]] during the transition from Type I to Type II, leading to [[Matrioshka brain|digitalized civilization]]).\n\n==Extensions to the original scale==\nMany extensions and modifications to the Kardashev scale have been proposed.\n\n* '''Types 0, IV, and V Kardashev rating:''' The most straightforward extension of the scale to even more hypothetical Type&nbsp;IV beings who can control or use the entire universe or Type&nbsp;V who control collections of universes.

They are the third of the [[Indian Railways WCAM class|WCAM series]]. They were specifically designed for use by [[Central Railway zone|Central Railways]] in the Ghat section towards [[Nashik]] and [[Pune Junction railway station|Pune]].\n\n== History ==\n\nThe WCAM-3 locomotives were developed after Central Railways faced a massive locomotive crisis in the 1990s. During this period, many of the WCM locomotives, which began to show their age, suffered several failures. As a result, CR had a tough time in maintaining train schedules, which led to the demand for a locomotive similar to the [[Indian locomotive class WCAM 2/2P|WCAM-2/2P]], which was already successful in the [[Western Railway zone|Western Railways]]. Thus the WCAM-3 was introduced along with the WCAG-1, with more power and traction.\n\nThe locomotive class was jointly developed by RDSO and BHEL in 1997. Components were shared with the WCAG-1 locos (see below). Co-Co fabricated bogies (High-Adhesion\u2014shwered with WCAG-1, WAG-7, WDG-2, etc.) with secondary suspension. Monocoque underframe. Air brakes were original equipment. They were originally manufactured under a BOLT (build-own-lease-transfer) contract with BHEL, and were probably still owned by BHEL rather than by IR. Axle-hung, nose-suspended, force ventilated, taper roller bearings Speed control by tap changers in AC mode and resistance notching in DC mode. Motors can be placed in different series-parallel combinations. Auxiliaries from Elgi, S F India, Best, Gresham & Craven, etc.\n\nStatic converter from ACEC for auxiliary supply. In DC mode, rheostatic braking by self-excitation of traction motors available until 17&nbsp;km/h. Elgi compressor, other auxiliaries from S F India. Rated for 105&nbsp;km/h in DC mode (AC mode rated speed was quoted at 120&nbsp;km/h although it can figuratively go up to 125&nbsp;km/h). Traction motor configurations as in the WCAM-1/2 and WAM-4 (all 6 in series, 2S 3P, or all parallel\u2014the latter was the only one used under AC traction, enforced now by modifications to the locos).\n\n=== Current Usage ===\n\nThe class are in active service in the [[Central Railway zone]].CR uses WCAM-3 locos on Mumbai-Pune and Mumbai-Igatpuri sections which had ghat portions as well as speed restrictions of about 100&nbsp;km/h. They also used to haul intercity trains out of Mumbai DC suburban region on [[Western Railway zone|Western]] as well as [[Central Railway zone|Central Railways]] which was on a 1500 V DC overhead system, as opposed to other parts of [[India]] which had 25000 V AC overhead.[http://www.irfca.org/gallery/Events/cracdcjan13/] WCAM engines now serve trains operating out of [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus railway station|Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT)]] and as bankers on Kasara-Igatpuri/Karjat-Lonavla section. Due to exclusivity in operation/maintenance of these locomotives, they do not go beyond the Central Railway's zone limits. These dual-traction models deliver 4600&nbsp;hp in DC mode and 5300&nbsp;hp in AC mode, and post 25 kV transformation, WCAMs were fully transformed into pure AC locomotives, and the performance was even more improved.\n\nFreight rakes double-headed by WCAM-3 (upgraded models) are a common sight on the ghat sections.

They are the third of the [[Indian Railways WCAM class|WCAM series]]. They were specifically designed for use by [[Central Railway zone|Central Railways]] in the Ghat section towards [[Nashik]] and [[Pune Junction railway station|Pune]].\n\n== History ==\n\nThe WCAM-3 locomotives were developed after Central Railways faced a massive locomotive crisis in the 1990s. During this period, many of the WCM locomotives, which began to show their age, suffered several failures. As a result, CR had a tough time in maintaining train schedules, which led to the demand for a locomotive similar to the [[Indian locomotive class WCAM 2/2P|WCAM-2/2P]], which was already successful in the [[Western Railway zone|Western Railways]]. Thus the WCAM-3 was introduced along with the WCAG-1, with more power and traction.\n\nThe locomotive class was jointly developed by RDSO and BHEL in 1997. Components were shared with the WCAG-1 locos (see below). Co-Co fabricated bogies (High-Adhesion\u2014shwered with WCAG-1, WAG-7, WDG-2, etc.) with secondary suspension. Monocoque underframe. Air brakes were original equipment. They were originally manufactured under a BOLT (build-own-lease-transfer) contract with BHEL, and were probably still owned by BHEL rather than by IR. Axle-hung, nose-suspended, force ventilated, taper roller bearings Speed control by tap changers in AC mode and resistance notching in DC mode. Motors can be placed in different series-parallel combinations. Auxiliaries from Elgi, S F India, Best, Gresham & Craven, etc.\n\nStatic converter from ACEC for auxiliary supply. In DC mode, rheostatic braking by self-excitation of traction motors available until 17&nbsp;km/h. Elgi compressor, other auxiliaries from S F India. Rated for 105&nbsp;km/h in DC mode (AC mode rated speed was quoted at 120&nbsp;km/h although it can figuratively go up to 125&nbsp;km/h). Traction motor configurations as in the WCAM-1/2 and WAM-4 (all 6 in series, 2S 3P, or all parallel\u2014the latter was the only one used under AC traction, enforced now by modifications to the locos).\n\n=== Current Usage ===\n\nThe class are in active service in the [[Central Railway zone]].CR uses WCAM-3 locos on Mumbai-Pune and Mumbai-Igatpuri sections which had ghat portions as well as speed restrictions of about 100&nbsp;km/h. They also used to haul intercity trains out of Mumbai DC suburban region on [[Western Railway zone|Western]] as well as [[Central Railway zone|Central Railways]] which was on a 1500 V DC overhead system, as opposed to other parts of [[India]] which had 25000 V AC overhead.[http://www.irfca.org/gallery/Events/cracdcjan13/] WCAM engines now serve trains operating out of [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus railway station|Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT)]] and as bankers on Kasara-Igatpuri/Karjat-Lonavla section. Due to exclusivity in operation/maintenance of these locomotives, they do not go beyond the Central Railway's zone limits. These dual-traction models deliver 4600&nbsp;hp in DC mode and 5300&nbsp;hp in AC mode, and post 25 kV transformation, WCAMs were fully transformed into pure AC locomotives, and the performance was even more improved.\n\nFreight rakes double-headed by WCAM-3 (upgraded models) are a common sight on the ghat sections. MU operation possible with 3 (4?) units. As of [12/05], all WCAM-3 locos had been retrofitted with roof-mounted rheostatic braking grids. The acceleration is similar to those of [[Indian locomotive class WAP-4|WAP-4s]] and sometimes, it is quoted to match the acceleration levels of [[Indian locomotive class WAP-7|WAP-7s]], although it's not been verified.\n\n== Sheds holding WCAM-3 engines ==\nAll 53 WCAM-3s locomotives are currently in service as on 01-03-2020 and all are at [[Kalyan Junction railway station|Kalyan ELS and Kalyan DLS]] of [[Central Railway zone|CR]].<br />('''Note-'''Before updating the information here anybody should check out the railways current official data first in the  '''Source''' link then change the data.)<br />'''Source:''' http://elocos.railnet.gov.in/\n\n==Technical specifications<ref name=IRFCA>[http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-loco-electric-dc.html#WCAM-2 WCAM-2] at Indian Railways Fan Club</ref>==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center; width:98%;\"\n|-\n!width=16%| '''Class''' \n!width=21%| '''WCAM\u20133''' \n|-\n|style=\"text-align:centre;\"|'''Year'''\n|1997+  \t\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:centre;\"|'''Maker'''\n| [[Bharat Heavy Electricals|BHEL]] \n|-\n|style=\"text-align:centre;\"|'''Traction Motors'''\n||Hitachi HS15250A.

There was also an Auckland Provincial team match against New South Wales, and one Auckland B fixture with the team making the trip down to Cambridge to play the local side. [[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]] also led the representative team in scoring with 37 points.\n\n===Carlaw Park===\nAt a pre-season meeting of the management committee it was discussed that [[Carlaw Park]] needed more \u2018modern equipment\u2019, and it was decided that \u201cthe establishment of more modern methods of dealing with the turf and the purchase of more efficient machinery shall be an early charge on the new season\u2019s funds\u201d.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Management Committee\n| page =3\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LIX| issue=18042\n| date = 1922-03-17\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19220317.2.16.6\n| accessdate = 2019-08-26}}</ref> Sufficient money was made from gates at club and rep fixtures at Carlaw Park and the Auckland Domain to begin improvements on the ground at the conclusion of the season.\n\n===New Clubs and Name Changes===\nThe [[Auckland Rugby League]] accepted a new club into the fold, named Central Mangere. They entered a team in the 2nd Grade.\n\nThe Maritime club also changed their name to \u2018Athletics\u2019 and in 1926 they were to change their name again to Grafton Athletic. This was not to be confused with [[Grafton Athletic]] who had existed as a team from 1914\u20131920 under the leadership of [[Karl Ifwersen]] and were now playing under the name of 'Fire Brigade'.\n\n[[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Rovers]] applied for entry into the Senior A Grade competition and this was approved. This made the competition an even 8 teams meaning 4 matches per round and no byes. Unlike most previous seasons there were no byes, no defaults, and no postponed matches meaning 56 matches were played in total, easily the most in the competitions history. Richmond would go on to finish 7th with 3 wins and 11 losses.\n\n{{s-start}}\n    {{s-bef|before=[[1921 Auckland Rugby League season|1921]]}}\n    {{s-ttl|title=14th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n    |years=1922}}\n    {{s-aft|after=[[1923 Auckland Rugby League season|1923]]}}\n    {{end}}\n\n===George Davidson's Return===\n[[George Davidson (athlete)|George Davidson]] played for Maritime (now named Athletics) in the 1919 season but had missed most of the 1920 and 1921 seasons as he was training for and competing at the Antwerp Olympics where he came 5th in the 200m final. He stated that over those two seasons he had only played for Maritime on two or three occasions as he was seeking a transfer to the [[City Rovers]] where his two brothers [[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill]] and [[Ben Davidson (rugby league)|Ben]] played. Athletics were denying his request and Davidson appealed to the league who then asked the Athletics club to reconsider his request \"favourably\". He would eventually have his transfer to City approved.\n\n== First Grade Championship ==\n\n=== Final Standings ===\n{|\n|-\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=175

"text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\nThe 1922 [[Auckland Rugby League]] was the 14th in its history. There were 68 teams playing across the various grades. [[City Rovers]] won the first grade championship for the 5th time, with [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] winning the Roope Rooster for the 2nd time. [[City Rovers]] also defended the Challenge Shield, warding off efforts from Petone, Tongariro, and Huntly to lift it from them. [[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]] set a record for points scored in an Auckland club rugby league season with 116 for [[City Rovers]]. He and his brothers [[Ben Davidson (rugby league)|Ben]] and [[George Davidson (athlete)|George]] between them scored 186 of City Rover's 339 points which was also a competition record for a team in a single season. City scored a further 19 points in the Roope Rooster competition and 85 points in their 3 Challenge Shield matches for 443 points in all official games.\n\nIt was an incredibly busy year for the Auckland representative team. They played more matches than some club teams had played in earlier seasons with ten matches in total. There was also an Auckland Provincial team match against New South Wales, and one Auckland B fixture with the team making the trip down to Cambridge to play the local side. [[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]] also led the representative team in scoring with 37 points.\n\n===Carlaw Park===\nAt a pre-season meeting of the management committee it was discussed that [[Carlaw Park]] needed more \u2018modern equipment\u2019, and it was decided that \u201cthe establishment of more modern methods of dealing with the turf and the purchase of more efficient machinery shall be an early charge on the new season\u2019s funds\u201d.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Management Committee\n| page =3\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LIX| issue=18042\n| date = 1922-03-17\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19220317.2.16.6\n| accessdate = 2019-08-26}}</ref> Sufficient money was made from gates at club and rep fixtures at Carlaw Park and the Auckland Domain to begin improvements on the ground at the conclusion of the season.\n\n===New Clubs and Name Changes===\nThe [[Auckland Rugby League]] accepted a new club into the fold, named Central Mangere. They entered a team in the 2nd Grade.\n\nThe Maritime club also changed their name to \u2018Athletics\u2019 and in 1926 they were to change their name again to Grafton Athletic. This was not to be confused with [[Grafton Athletic]] who had existed as a team from 1914\u20131920 under the leadership of [[Karl Ifwersen]] and were now playing under the name of 'Fire Brigade'.\n\n[[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Rovers]] applied for entry into the Senior A Grade competition and this was approved. This made the competition an even 8 teams meaning 4 matches per round and no byes. Unlike most previous seasons there were no byes, no defaults, and no postponed matches meaning 56 matches were played in total, easily the most in the competitions history. Richmond would go on to finish 7th with 3 wins and 11 losses.\n\n{{s-start}}\n    {{s-bef|before=[[1921 Auckland Rugby League season|1921]]}}\n    {{s-ttl|title=14th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n    |years=1922}}\n    {{s-aft|after=[[1923 Auckland Rugby League season|1923]]}}\n    {{end}}\n\n===George Davidson's Return===\n[[George Davidson (athlete)|George Davidson]] played for Maritime (now named Athletics) in the 1919 season but had missed most of the 1920 and 1921 seasons as he was training for and competing at the Antwerp Olympics where he came 5th in the 200m final. He stated that over those two seasons he had only played for Maritime on two or three occasions as he was seeking a transfer to the [[City Rovers]] where his two brothers [[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill]] and [[Ben Davidson (rugby league)|Ben]] played. Athletics were denying his request and Davidson appealed to the league who then asked the Athletics club to reconsider his request \"favourably\". He would eventually have his transfer to City approved.\n\n== First Grade Championship ==\n\n=== Final Standings ===\n{|\n|-\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=175

He is credited as the first African American to receive the Ph.D. degree from [[Boston University]], which was granted in 1887.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nBowen was born in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], on December 3, 1855, the son of Edward Bowen and Rose Simon Bowen. Edward Bowen, a carpenter, was originally from Maryland and later lived in [[Washington, D.C.]], but moved to New Orleans, where he was enslaved and held in bondage until he purchased his own freedom. In 1858, he purchased freedom for his wife and son, then three years old. Edward Bowen later served in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Rose Simon Bowen was the granddaughter of an African princess of the Jolloffer tribe on the west coast of Africa. (This information comes from a one-page anonymous biographical sketch of Bowen while he was still living).\n\n===Education===\n[[Image:J.W.E.Bowen, Sr., ca. 1880s.jpg|thumb|upright|J. W. E.

Bowen III]], c. 1927.]]\n\nAfter the Civil War, J. W. E. Bowen studied at the Union Normal School in New Orleans, and [[New Orleans University]], a university established by the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] for the education of freedmen. (New Orleans University merged with [[Straight College]] in 1934 to form [[Dillard University]]) Bowen received a Bachelor of Arts degree with the university's first graduating class in 1878. From 1878 to 1882, he taught mathematics, Latin and Greek at Central Tennessee College (later known as [[Walden University (Tennessee)]]) in Nashville.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dbcs.rutgers.edu/all-scholars/8564-bowen-john-wesley-edward|title=BOWEN, John Wesley Edward|last=Gordon|first=Laura|website=Departmental Web Site Template {{!}} Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey|language=en-gb|access-date=2019-04-18}}</ref>\n\nIn 1882, Bowen began theological studies at Boston University. While a theological student, he was the pastor of Revere Street Methodist Episcopal Church in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. In 1884, he completed work on, and was awarded, a Master of Arts (M.A.) degree from New Orleans University. When he completed the requirements for the Bachelor of Sacred Theology (S.T.B.) degree from Boston University in 1885, his classmates selected him as one of two students to speak at commencement exercises.\n\nAfter graduation, Bowen became pastor of St. John's Methodist Episcopal Church in Newark, New Jersey. He received a Master of Arts degree from New Orleans University in 1886. He married [[Ariel Serena Hedges Bowen|Ariel Serena Hedges]] of Baltimore, Maryland in 1886. They became the parents of four children.\n\nIn that same year, Bowen entered the Ph.D. program at [[Boston University]] in historical theology. He also did special advanced work in Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Chaldee, Arabic, and German, and in metaphysics and psychology. Boston University conferred the Ph.D. degree upon him in 1887. Later, Gammon Theological Seminary made him its first recipient of the honorary degree of doctor of divinity.\n\n===Baltimore and Washington D.C. years===\nBowen was chiefly a pastor after completing his doctoral degree. He pastored the Centennial Methodist Episcopal Church in Baltimore and also served as a professor of church history and systematic theology at [[Morgan State University|Morgan College]]. A gifted preacher, Bowen conducted a notable revival during this pastorate in which there were 735 conversions. Bowen also served as pastor of Asbury Methodist Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C. and as a professor of Hebrew at [[Howard University]].\n\nFrom 1889 to 1893, Bowen was a member and examiner for the American Institute of Sacred Literature. In 1892, he published \"What Shall the Harvest Be? A National Sermon; or A Series of Plain Talks to the Colored People of America, on Their Problems.\" He represented the Methodist Episcopal church at the Conferences of World Methodism in Washington D.C. in 1891 and London in 1901.\n\n===Years at Gammon Theological Seminary===\nIn 1893, Bowen became professor of historical theology at [[Interdenominational Theological Center|Gammon Theological Seminary]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], a seminary founded in 1883 by the Methodist Episcopal Church for the preparation of African-American clergymen. He was the first African-American to teach there full-time. As the secretary of Gammon's Stewart Missionary Foundation for Africa, he also edited its periodical, the ''Stewart Missionary Magazine''.\n\nIn October, 1895, Bowen delivered '''''\"An Appeal to the King\"''''' on \"Negro Day\" at the Atlanta Cotton States' Exposition. That December, he organized an important three-day conference on Africa held in conjunction with the exposition and published its proceedings as \"Africa and the American Negro...Addresses and Proceedings of the Congress on Africa Held Under the Auspices of the Stewart Missionary Foundation for Africa of Gammon Theological Seminary in Connection with the Cotton States and International Exposition December 13\u201315, 1895\" (1896).\n\nAs a member of the Board of Control of the Methodist Episcopal Church's Epworth League, he organized a national conference in Atlanta on the Christian education of African-American youth. With [[Irvine Garland Penn]], Bowen also edited and published its proceedings, \"The United Negro:\u2026Addresses and Proceedings, The Negro Young People's Christian and Educational Congress,\" held on August 6&ndash;11, 1902 (1902).\n\nIn January 1904, Bowen and [[Jesse Max Barber]] launched ''[[The Voice of the Negro]]'', a Literary journal addressed to a national audience of African Americans. In September, 1905, they endorsed the [[Niagara Movement]]. Months later, they promoted the organization of the [[Georgia Equal Rights League]], which had similar objectives. At the peak of its circulation in 1906, ''The Voice of the Negro'' claimed 12,000 to 15,000 subscribers.\n\nIn 1906, Bowen became the President of Gammon. In September, however, his inaugural year was shadowed by a severe race riot in which white rioters brutally attacked black people in Atlanta. Bowen opened the seminary to shelter black refugees from the riot. Three days after the rioting began, he was beaten and arrested by Atlanta's white police. Barber fled the city, taking ''The Voice of the Negro'' with him to Chicago, where he continued its publication for a year without Bowen's assistance. Bowen survived the Atlanta race riot and served as Gammon's President until 1910.\n\nBowen retired as head of the church history department of Gammon in 1926 but continued to teach until 1932, when he became an emeritus professor.\n\nBowen and his first wife, [[Ariel Serena Hedges Bowen]], were the parents of four children. One of the children, John W.E. Bowen Jr., graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy, Wesleyan University and Harvard University. He became, like his father, a prominent figure in the Methodist Episcopal church, and was elected a bishop in 1949.  Bowen's first wife died in 1904 while visiting the World's Fair in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1906 he married Irene L. Smallwood, who survived him. Bowen died on July 20, 1933, the last of his New Orleans University graduating class and the school's oldest alumnus.\n\n\"Who has not heard of John Wesley Edward Bowen, who was born in New Orleans in 1855, educated there and at Boston University and has worked at Morgan, Howard and Gammon?  For twenty-five years while at Gammon he has been the kind of upstanding figure in the Methodist Episcopal Church which has made that church hesitate to get rid of him and his kind.\" (W. E. B.

For twenty-five years while at Gammon he has been the kind of upstanding figure in the Methodist Episcopal Church which has made that church hesitate to get rid of him and his kind.\" (W. E. B.
