During the subsequent century the French carried out several excavation campaigns directed by [[Pierre Montet]], then by [[Jean Yoyotte]] and subsequently by Philippe Brissaud.<ref name=bard/>{{rp|921}} For some time the overwhelming amount of monuments bearing the cartouches of Ramesses II or [[Merenptah]] led archaeologists to believe that Tanis and Pi-Ramesses were in fact the same. Furthermore, the discovery of the [[Year 400 Stela]] at Tanis led to the speculation that Tanis should also be identified with the older, former [[Hyksos]] capital, [[Avaris]]. The later re-discovery of the actual, neighbouring archaeological sites of Pi-Ramesses ([[Qantir]]) and Avaris ([[Tell el-Dab'a]]) made clear that the earlier identifications were incorrect, and that all the Ramesside and pre-Ramesside monuments at Tanis were in fact brought here from Pi-Ramesses or other cities.<ref name=bard/>{{rp|921\u20132}}\n\nThere are ruins of a number of temples, including the chief temple dedicated to [[Amun]], and a very important royal [[necropolis]] of the Third Intermediate Period (which contains the only known intact royal pharaonic burials&nbsp;\u2014 the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]] having been entered in antiquity). The burials of three pharaohs of the 21st and 22nd Dynasties&nbsp;\u2014 [[Psusennes I]], [[Amenemope (pharaoh)|Amenemope]] and [[Shoshenq II]] &nbsp;\u2014 survived the depredations of tomb robbers throughout antiquity. They were discovered intact in 1939 and 1940 by [[Pierre Montet]] and proved to contain a large catalogue of gold, jewelry, [[lapis lazuli]] and other precious stones, as well as the funerary masks of these kings.\n\nThe chief deities of Tanis were Amun; his consort, Mut; and their child Khonsu, forming the Tanite triad. This triad was, however, identical to that of Thebes, leading many scholars to speak of Tanis as the \"northern Thebes\".\n\nIn 2009, the [[Ministry of Culture (Egypt)|Egyptian Culture Ministry]] reported archaeologists had discovered a sacred lake in the temple of Mut at Tanis. The lake, built out of limestone blocks, had been 15 meters long and 5 meters deep. It was discovered 12 meters below ground in good condition. The lake could have been built during the late [[25th Dynasty|25th]]\u2013early [[26th Dynasty]].<ref>[https://www.egyptindependent.com/sacred-lake-found-delta/ Bossone, Andrew.

During the subsequent century the French carried out several excavation campaigns directed by [[Pierre Montet]], then by [[Jean Yoyotte]] and subsequently by Philippe Brissaud.<ref name=bard/>{{rp|921}} For some time the overwhelming amount of monuments bearing the cartouches of Ramesses II or [[Merenptah]] led archaeologists to believe that Tanis was in fact the same place as Pi-Ramesses. Furthermore, the discovery of the [[Year 400 Stela]] at Tanis led to the speculation that Tanis should also be identified with the older, former [[Hyksos]] capital, [[Avaris]]. The later re-discovery of the actual, neighbouring archaeological sites of Pi-Ramesses ([[Qantir]]) and Avaris ([[Tell el-Dab'a]]) made clear that all the Ramesside monuments at Tanis were in fact brought here from Pi-Ramesses.<ref name=bard/>{{rp|921\u20132}}\n\nThere are ruins of a number of temples, including the chief temple dedicated to [[Amun]], and a very important royal [[necropolis]] of the Third Intermediate Period (which contains the only known intact royal pharaonic burials&nbsp;\u2014 the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]] having been entered in antiquity). The burials of three pharaohs of the 21st and 22nd Dynasties&nbsp;\u2014 [[Psusennes I]], [[Amenemope (pharaoh)|Amenemope]] and [[Shoshenq II]] &nbsp;\u2014 survived the depredations of tomb robbers throughout antiquity. They were discovered intact in 1939 and 1940 by [[Pierre Montet]] and proved to contain a large catalogue of gold, jewelry, [[lapis lazuli]] and other precious stones, as well as the funerary masks of these kings.\n\nThe chief deities of Tanis were Amun; his consort, Mut; and their child Khonsu, forming the Tanite triad. This triad was, however, identical to that of Thebes, leading many scholars to speak of Tanis as the \"northern Thebes\".\n\nIn 2009, the [[Ministry of Culture (Egypt)|Egyptian Culture Ministry]] reported archaeologists had discovered a sacred lake in the temple of Mut at Tanis. The lake, built out of limestone blocks, had been 15 meters long and 5 meters deep. It was discovered 12 meters below ground in good condition. The lake could have been built during the late [[25th Dynasty|25th]]\u2013early [[26th Dynasty]].<ref>[https://www.egyptindependent.com/sacred-lake-found-delta/ Bossone, Andrew.

They looked to improve upon their 3\u201313 season the year before, and did so after defeating the [[2012 Tennessee Titans season|Tennessee Titans]] in Week 5; their win over the [[2012 Houston Texans season|Houston Texans]] in Week 16 made this their first winning season since [[2009 Minnesota Vikings season|2009]]. The Vikings also made the playoffs for the first time since 2009 with a Week 17 win over the [[Green Bay Packers]] to give them a 10\u20136 regular season record, but were defeated by the same opponents in the Wild Card playoff round the following week. [[Adrian Peterson]] was named the league's [[Most Valuable Player]] after rushing for 2,097 yards, just nine yards short of breaking the single-season record held by [[Eric Dickerson]] since [[1984 NFL season|1984]].\n\nOn May 10, 2012, the [[Minnesota State Legislature]] approved a bill for a new stadium for the team that would see a new facility (later named [[U.S. Bank Stadium]]) constructed by 2016 and ensure the Vikings' presence in [[Minneapolis]] through the year 2046.<ref>{{cite news |title=New Minnesota Vikings stadium law heads to governor amid questions over state's financing |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-minnesota-vikings-stadium-law-heads-to-governor-amid-questions-over-states-financing/ |website=CBSNews.com |publisher=CBS Interactive |date=May 11, 2012 |accessdate=January 28, 2018 }}</ref> The bill was signed by Governor [[Mark Dayton]] on May 14,<ref>{{cite news |title=Dayton Signs $975M Vikings Stadium Bill |url=http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2012/05/14/dayton-to-sign-975m-vikings-stadium-bill/ |work=CBS Minnesota |publisher=CBS Broadcasting |date=May 14, 2012 |accessdate=January 28, 2018 }}</ref> and approved by the [[Minneapolis City Council]] by a vote of 7\u20136 on May 25.<ref>{{cite news |first=Frederick |last=Melo |title=Vikings stadium wins Minneapolis City Council's final approval |url=https://www.twincities.com/2012/05/24/vikings-stadium-wins-minneapolis-city-councils-final-approval/ |website=TwinCities.com |publisher=Digital First Media |date=May 24, 2012 |accessdate=January 28, 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=City Council's Final Vote In Favor Of Stadium, 7-6 |url=http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2012/05/25/mpls-city-council-makes-final-stadium-vote-friday/ |work=CBS Minnesota |publisher=CBS Broadcasting |date=May 25, 2012 |accessdate=January 28, 2018 }}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Offseason==\n[[File:Adrian Peterson broke Vikings franchise rushing record.jpg|thumb|Adrian Peterson rushed to a new career franchise record against Jacksonville in week 1, overtaking [[Robert Smith (running back)|Robert Smith]]'s 6,818 rushing yards]]\n\n===Pre-draft transactions===\nThe first major transactions of the 2012 offseason were the releases of veteran guards [[Steve Hutchinson (American football)|Steve Hutchinson]] and [[Anthony Herrera (American football)|Anthony Herrera]], and CB [[Cedric Griffin]] on March 10, as the Vikings began rebuilding their offensive line and secondary. Three days later, the team re-signed perennial backup QB [[Sage Rosenfels]] and DT [[Letroy Guion]] off their unrestricted free agents list. This was followed up with the signing of the [[Seattle Seahawks]]' unrestricted free agent TE [[John Carlson (American football)|John Carlson]] on a five-year contract.\n\nThe next week, the team brought in FB [[Jerome Felton]], also an unrestricted free agent, from the [[Indianapolis Colts]]. They then released DT [[Remi Ayodele]] on March 21, but re-signed DT [[Fred Evans (defensive tackle)|Fred Evans]]. March 26 was a big day for signings by the Vikings, with the re-signings of WR [[Devin Aromashodu]] and LB [[Erin Henderson]], as well as the free agent acquisitions of CB [[Zack Bowman]] from the [[Chicago Bears]] and T [[Geoff Schwartz]] from the [[Carolina Panthers]].\n\nApril saw very few transactions go through in anticipation of the [[2012 NFL Draft]] at the end of the month. Nevertheless, the Vikings signed LB [[Marvin Mitchell]] and WR [[Jerome Simpson]], despite the fact that Simpson would miss the first three games of the season for a violation of the NFL's substance abuse policy.\n\n===Draft===\n{{main|2012 NFL draft}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|style=\"background-color:lightsteelblue; border:1px solid #aaaaaa; width:2em;\"|\n|[[Pro Bowl]]er\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

Inaugurated in 1872, the [[graded stakes race|Grade I]] race is run over a distance of one and one-quarter miles on the dirt track at [[Saratoga Race Course]]. Held in mid August, it currently offers a purse of $600,000. In 2010 it became the third leg of the [[American Triple Tiara of Thoroughbred Racing]], after the [[Acorn Stakes]] and [[Coaching Club American Oaks]].\n\nThe Alabama Stakes is named in honor of William Cottrell of [[Mobile, Alabama]]. \"Alabama\" was the name settled on because Cottrell was too modest to have a race named for him personally.\n\nThe race was not run from 1893 to 1896 and 1898 to 1900. Due to the New York State ban on [[parimutuel betting]] there was no racing in the state in 1911 and 1912. During [[World War II]], from 1943 through 1945 the Alabama Stakes was run at [[Belmont Park]].\n\nThe race has been contested at various distances: \n*1 mile and 1 furlong - 1872-1901, 1904, 1906-1916\n*{{frac|1|1|16}} miles - 1901, 1902, and on the turf in 1903\n*{{frac|1|5|16}} miles - 1905\n*{{frac|1|1|4}} miles - 1917 to present\n\n==Records==\n'''Speed record at current distance: '''\n* 2:00.80 - {{frac|1|1|4}} miles set by [[Go For Wand]] in 1990.\n\n'''Most wins by an owner:'''\n* 5 - [[Belair Stud]] (1924, 1942, 1944, 1946, 1953)\n* 4 - [[Walter M.

Inaugurated in 1872, the [[graded stakes race|Grade I]] race is run over a distance of one and one-quarter miles on the dirt track at [[Saratoga Race Course]]. Held in mid August, it currently offers a purse of $600,000. In 2010 it became the third leg of the [[American Triple Tiara of Thoroughbred Racing]], after the [[Acorn Stakes]] and [[Coaching Club American Oaks]].\n\nThe Alabama Stakes is named in honor of William Cottrell of [[Mobile, Alabama]]. \"Alabama\" was the name settled on because Cottrell was too modest to have a race named for him personally.\n\nThe race was not run from 1893 to 1896 and 1898 to 1900. Due to the New York State ban on [[parimutuel betting]] there was no racing in the state in 1911 and 1912. During [[World War II]], from 1943 through 1945 the Alabama Stakes was run at [[Belmont Park]].\n\nThe race has been contested at various distances: \n*1 mile and 1 furlong - 1872-1901, 1904, 1906-1916\n*{{frac|1|1|16}} miles - 1901, 1902, and on the turf in 1903\n*{{frac|1|5|16}} miles - 1905\n*{{frac|1|1|4}} miles - 1917 to present\n\n==Records==\n'''Speed record at current distance: '''\n* 2:00.80 - {{frac|1|1|4}} miles set by [[Go For Wand]] in 1990.\n\n'''Most wins by an owner:'''\n* 5 - [[Belair Stud]] (1924, 1942, 1944, 1946, 1953)\n* 4 - [[Walter M.

Although supplemented by semi- and fully automatic rifles during World War II, it remained the primary [[German military rifles|German service rifle]] until the end of the war in 1945. Millions were captured by the Soviets at the conclusion of World War II and were widely distributed as [[military aid]]. The Karabiner 98k therefore continues to appear in conflicts across the world as they are taken out of storage during times of strife.\n\n==History==\nIn February 1934 the ''[[Waffenamt|Heereswaffenamt]]'' (Army Weapons Agency) ordered the adoption of a new military rifle. The Karabiner 98k was derived from earlier rifles, namely the Mauser [[Standardmodell rifle|''Standardmodell'' of 1924]] and the Karabiner 98b, which in turn had both been developed from the [[Gewehr 98]]. Since the Karabiner 98k rifle was shorter than the earlier Karabiner 98b (the 98b was a [[carbine]] in name only, a version of Gewehr 98 long rifle with upgraded sights), it was given the designation ''Karabiner 98 kurz'', meaning \"Carbine 98 Short\". Just like its predecessor, the rifle was noted for its reliability, great accuracy and an effective range of up to {{convert|500|m|yards|-1}} with iron sights and {{convert|1000|m|yards|-1}} with an 8\u00d7 [[telescopic sight]].<ref name=\"bishop1998\"/>\n\nThe desire for adopting new shorter barreled rifles and the introduction of the Karabiner 98k, featuring a {{convert|600|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} long barrel, were reasons for changing the standard German service ball rifle cartridge. The 1903 pattern 7.92\u00d757mm Mauser ''S Patrone'' produced excessive muzzle flash when fired from arms that did not have a long barrel like the Gewehr 98. It was found that the ''s.S. Patrone'', originally designed for long range machine gun use, produced less muzzle flash out of rifles that had a shorter barrel and also provided better accuracy. Because of this the ''S Patrone'' was phased out in 1933 and the ''s.S. Patrone'' became the standard German service ball cartridge in the 1930s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waffen-welt.de/bilder/DiePatrone7.92x57.pdf|title=Die Patrone 7.92mm (8x57)|author=|date=|website=waffen-welt.de|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822032655/http://www.waffen-welt.de/bilder/DiePatrone7.92x57.pdf|archivedate=22 August 2016|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rifleshootermag.com/historical/20th-century-german-military-arms/|title=20th Century German Military Arms and Ammo - RifleShooter|author=|date=18 February 2016|website=rifleshootermag.com|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611031322/http://www.rifleshootermag.com/historical/20th-century-german-military-arms/|archivedate=11 June 2017|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Design details==\n===Features===\n[[File:K98kclip.jpg|thumb|right|Karabiner 98k stripper clip with five 7.92\u00d757mm Mauser cartridges]]\n[[File:Disassembled mauser long action.jpg|thumb|right|A disassembled Karabiner 98k action]]\n\nThe Karabiner 98k is a controlled-feed bolt-action rifle based on the [[Gewehr 98#M98 controlled-feed bolt-action system|Mauser M98 system]]. Its internal [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]] can be loaded with five [[7.92\u00d757mm Mauser]] cartridges from a [[stripper clip]] or one-by-one.<ref name=giwarchive>{{cite book|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=German Infantry Weapons|url=https://archive.org/stream/GermanInfantryWeapons#page/n35/mode/2up|publisher=United States War Department|page=23|date=May 25, 1943}}</ref> The straight bolt handle found on the Gewehr 98 bolt was replaced by a turned-down bolt handle on the Karabiner 98k. This change made it easier to rapidly operate the bolt, reduced the amount the handle projected beyond the receiver, and enabled mounting of aiming optics directly above the [[Receiver (firearms)|receiver]]. Each rifle was furnished with a short length of cleaning rod, fitted through the bayonet stud. The joined rods from 3 rifles provided one full-length cleaning rod.\n\nThe metal parts of the rifle were [[Bluing (steel)|blued]], a process in which steel is partially protected against rust by a layer of [[magnetite]] (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>). Such a thin [[black oxide]] layer provides only minimal protection against rust or corrosion, unless also treated with a water-displacing oil to reduce wetting and [[galvanic corrosion]]. From 1944 onwards [[phosphate conversion coating|phosphating]]/[[Parkerizing]] was introduced as a more effective metal surface treatment.<ref name=\"Karabiner 98k at www.waffenhq.de\"/>\n\n===Sights===\nThe impractical \"Langevisier\" or \"rollercoaster\" rear sight of the Mauser Gewehr 1898 was replaced with a conventional tangent leaf sight. The Karabiner 98k rear tangent sight was flatter compared to and does not obstruct the view to the sides during aiming as the ''Langevisier'' (long sight). Originally, the Karabiner 98k [[iron sight]] line had an open-pointed-post-type front sight, and a tangent-type rear sight with a V-shaped rear notch.<ref name=giwarchive/> From 1939 onwards the post front sight was hooded to reduce [[glare (vision)|glare]] under unfavourable light conditions and add protection for the post. These standard sight lines consisted of somewhat coarse aiming elements, making it suitable for rough field handling, aiming at distant area fire targets and low-light usage, but less suitable for precise aiming at distant or small point targets.  It is graduated for 7.92\u00d757mm Mauser ''s.S. Patrone'' cartridges loaded with 12.8 g (197 gr) s.S. (''schweres Spitzgescho\u00df'' \u2013 \"heavy pointed bullet\") ball bullets from {{convert|100|to|2000|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} in {{convert|100|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} increments. The sight line of early productions rifles have the ranging scale copied at the bottom of the tangent aiming element for setting the range whilst lying down. The Karabiner 98k has a {{convert|500|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} sight radius.\n\n===Stock===\nEarly Karabiner 98k rifles had solid [[Walnut#Wood|walnut wood]] or from 1943 some had solid [[oak wood]] [[Stock (firearm)#Wood stocks|one-piece stocks]]. From 1937 onwards the rifles had [[Stock (firearm)#Laminated wood|laminated stocks]], the result of trials that had stretched through the 1930s.<ref name=\"Karabiner 98k at www.waffenhq.de\"/> [[Plywood]] [[laminates]] are stronger and resisted warping better than the conventional one-piece patterns, did not require lengthy maturing, and were cheaper. The laminated stocks were, due to their dense composite structure, somewhat heavier compared to one-piece stocks.<ref name=mmrw2>{{cite book|title=Mauser Military Rifles of the World |first=Robert W.D.|last= Ball |edition =5|publisher= Gun Digest Books|year= 2011 |pages=222, 227|isbn=978-1-4402-1544-5|ref=harv }}</ref> In addition to the use of walnut and [[beech]] laminate, [[elm]] was used in small quantities. The butts of the [[pistol grip|semi-pistol grip]] Karabiner 98k stocks were not uniform. Until early 1940 the stocks had a flat buttplate. After 1940 some stocks had a cupped buttplate to prevent the separation of the butt stock.

The 30&nbsp;mm ''Schiessbecher'' cup-type rifle grenade launcher could be mounted on any Karabiner 98k and was intended to replace all previous rifle grenade launcher models. The rifle grenade launcher could be used against infantry, fortifications and light armored vehicles up to a range of 280 m (306 yd). For these differing tasks, several specialized grenades with accompanying special propelling cartridges were developed for the 1,450,113 produced ''Schiessbecher'' rifle grenade launchers. The rifle grenade-propelling cartridges fired a wooden projectile through the barrel to the rifle grenade that, upon impact, automatically primed the rifle grenade. The ''Schiessbecher'' could be mounted on the [[Gewehr 98#Karabiner 98a|Karabiner 98a]], [[G98/40]], [[StG 44]] and [[FG 42]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whq-forum.de/cms/604.0.html |title=Der Schie\u00dfbecher (Gewehrgranatenger\u00e4t) |language=German |url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822174550/http://www.whq-forum.de/cms/604.0.html |archivedate=2010-08-22 |df= }}</ref>\n\n====Suppressor====\nA removable, muzzle-mounted HUB-23 [[suppressor]], visually resembling the ''Schie\u00dfbecher,'' was manufactured for the Karabiner 98k.

This ergonomic problem was solved by mounting the telescopic sight relatively high above the receiver and sometimes modifying or replacing the safety operating lever or using an offset mounting to position the telescopic sight axis to the left side in relation to the receiver center axis. A common minor modification was replacing the stock buttplate with a waffled anti-slip \"sniper\" buttplate.

The rate of fire was limited by how quickly the [[Bolt (firearm)|bolt]] could be operated. Its magazine had only half the capacity of Great Britain's [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] series rifles, but being internal, it made the weapon more comfortable to carry at its point of balance. An experimental trench magazine was produced during World War I (originally intended only for the original Gewehr 98 but it could be made to work with all Model 98 variants) that could be attached to the bottom of the internal magazine by removing the floor plate, increasing capacity to 20 rounds, though it still required loading with 5-round stripper clips.\n\nWhile the Americans had standardized a semi-automatic rifle in 1936 (the [[M1 Garand]]), the Germans maintained these bolt-action rifles due to their tactical doctrine of basing a [[Squad#Wehrmacht|squad]]'s firepower on the [[general-purpose machine gun]] in the [[light machine gun]] role so that the role of the rifleman was largely to carry ammunition and provide covering fire for the machine gunners. The advantage of the general purpose machine gun concept was that it added greatly to the overall volume of fire that could be put out by a squad-sized unit.<ref>Hogg, Ian V., & Weeks, John.

Due to the relatively limited production of semi-automatic and assault rifles, the Karabiner 98k remained the primary service weapon until the last days of the war, and was manufactured until the surrender in May 1945.\n\nIn close combat, however, [[submachine gun]]s were often preferred, especially for urban combat, where the rifle's range and low rate of fire were not very useful, although the rifle's powerful ammunition was better able to penetrate walls and other cover found in urban areas. Towards the end of the war, it was intended to phase out the Karabiner 98k in favour of the StG 44, which fired the [[7.92\u00d733mm Kurz]] [[Intermediate cartridges|intermediate rifle round]] that was more powerful than the pistol cartridges of submachine guns, but that could be used like a submachine gun in close-quarters and urban fighting.

It saw action in every theatre of war involving German forces, including occupied Europe, North Africa, the Soviet Union, Finland, and Norway. Although comparable to the weapons fielded by Germany's enemies at the beginning of the War, its disadvantages in rate of fire became more apparent as American and Soviet armies began to field more semi-automatic weapons among their troops. Still, it continued to be the main infantry rifle of the Wehrmacht until the end of the War. Resistance forces in German-occupied Europe made frequent use of captured German Karabiner 98k rifles. The [[Soviet Union]] also made extensive use of captured Karabiner 98k rifles and other German infantry weapons due to the [[Red Army]] experiencing a critical shortage of small arms during the early years of World War II.

The electro-penciled bolt and the X on the left side of the receiver are indicators of a Russian-captured weapon.]]\n\nDuring World War II, the Soviet Union captured millions of Mauser Karabiner 98k rifles and re-furbished them in various arms factories in the late 1940s and early 1950s. These rifles, referred to by collectors as RC (\"Russian Capture\") Mausers, can be identified by an \"X\" stamp on the left side of the receiver. The Soviet arsenals made no effort to match the rifle's original parts by serial number when reassembling them, and some metal parts (the cleaning rod, sight hood, and locking screws) were omitted after rebuilding, and instead were melted down and recycled, presumably with the other parts that weren't suitable for re-use.\n\nMany of these rifles (along with the [[Mosin\u2013Nagant]] rifle) served in conflicts after World War II. One example of Soviet-captured Mauser Kar98k rifles being used in post-WWII conflicts is the [[Korean War]], where a number of these rifles were provided by the Soviet Union (along with Soviet-made small arms) to Chinese Communist forces to supplement their supply of [[Type Zhongzheng]] rifles. Both the Soviet-capture Kar98k rifle and the Chinese Type Zhongzheng rifle were used extensively by the [[People's Volunteer Army]] throughout the course of the Korean War.\n\nThe Korean War would not be the only conflict where Soviet-capture Kar98k rifles and WWII German small arms were provided to the allies of the Soviet Union. The [[Vietnam War]] would become another example with Soviet-capture Mauser Karabiner 98k rifles being provided to [[North Vietnam]] by the USSR as military aid. Many Soviet-capture Karabiner 98k rifles (as well as some Karabiner 98k rifles that were left behind by the French after the [[First Indochina War]] and Type Zhongzheng rifles provided by the People's Republic of China) were found in the hands of [[Viet Cong]] guerrillas and [[Vietnam People's Army|People's Army of Vietnam]] (NVA) soldiers by US, South Vietnamese, South Korean, Australian and New Zealand forces alongside Soviet-bloc rifles like the Mosin\u2013Nagant, the [[SKS]], and the [[AK-47]].<ref>[http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/394026.pdf/ Operation Denver After Action Report, 1966 ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220233817/http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/394026.pdf |date=2017-02-20 }} Pg. 6, Retrieved Feb 15, 2018</ref>\n\n==== Post-occupation service ====\nIn the years after World War II, several European nations on both sides of the Iron Curtain that were invaded and occupied by Nazi Germany used the Mauser Karabiner 98k rifle as their standard-issue infantry rifle, due to the large number of German weapons that were left behind by the Germans at the end of World War II.\n\nNations like France and Norway used the Mauser Karabiner 98k rifle and other German weapons in the years after World War II.

These Norwegian conversions had a section of the receiver flattened on the upper left side, where a new serial number (with a prefix denoting the branch of service) was stamped. Some of these rifles conversions were rechambered again to [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]],<ref name=\"Grant 50\"/> but this program was canceled with only a few thousand converted when Norway adopted the [[AG-3|AG-3 (H&K G3)]] as a replacement for both the M1 and the K98k. Some actions from Mauser Karabiner 98k left by German armed forces in 1945 were used by Kongsberg V\u00e5penfabrikk (currently Kongsberg Small Arms) for building both military and civilian sniper/target rifles under the [[Mauser M59|Kongsberg V\u00e5penfabrikk Skarpskyttergev\u00e6r M59 - Mauser M59]] and [[Mauser M67|Kongsberg V\u00e5penfabrikk Skarpskyttergev\u00e6r M67 - Mauser M67]] designations. These rifles were used by the Norwegian armed forces up to the 2000s.\n\nIn West Germany, the Karabiner 98k were issued to the [[Bundesgrenzschutz]] (BGS; {{lang-en|[[Federalism|Federal]] [[Border guard|Border Guard]]}}), which was originally organized along paramilitary lines and armed as light infantry; in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-25657503.html|title=BUNDESGRENZSCHUTZ: Bitte Einmarsch|author=|date=9 September 1953|publisher=|volume=37|accessdate=28 April 2018|via=Spiegel Online|url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427205357/http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-25657503.html|archivedate=27 April 2017|df=}}</ref>\n\nFormer German Karabiner 98k rifles were widely distributed throughout the Eastern Bloc, some being refurbished two or three times by different factories.

The Combat Group members are equipped with Karabiner 98k rifles.]]\n\nEast German refurbished Karabiner 98ks featured Russian-style thicker blue finish, a 'sunburst' proof mark and sometimes had the factory designation '1001' applied, which was the factory where the refurbishment was carried out. Numbers were re-stamped to match the receiver and old numbers barred out. Numbers of East German and Czech refurbished Karabiner 98ks were exported to the West in the late 1980s and early 1990s and are now in the hands of collectors. Russian Capture Karabiner 98ks were exported to the West in large numbers in the early and mid-2000s.\n\n==== Yugoslavian postwar refurbishment ====\n{{main|Zastava M 98/48}}\nBecause of the lack of weapons after World War II, the [[Yugoslavia]]n arms producer Crvena Zastava (Nowadays [[Zastava Arms]]) refurbished German Karabiner 98k rifles that were left over or captured during the war. These rifles are readily identifiable as the German factory code markings have been scrubbed from the receiver and replaced with the Yugoslavian communist crest and the marking \"Preduze\u0107e 44\" on the receiver's ring. In addition to this, if the refurbishment took place after 1950, the marking \"/48\" was added to the \"Mod. 98\" originally present on the left side of the receiver, becoming \"Mod. 98/48\". The refurbished rifles were known also as [[Zastava M 98/48]]. The refurbished Pr\u0435duze\u0107e 44 Karabiner 98k rifles were still being used in the [[Yugoslav Wars]] of the 1990s.\n\n== Post\u2013World War II derivatives ==\nMany of the liberated European countries continued production of rifles similar to the Karabiner 98k, for example [[Fabrique Nationale de Herstal|Fabrique Nationale]] (FN) in Belgium<ref name=\"FN Israel\">{{cite web|title= Karabiner 98k (Israel)|url=https://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/30029770|website=iwm.org.uk|publisher=[[Imperial War Museum]]}}</ref> and [[\u010cesk\u00e1 zbrojovka firearms|\u010cesk\u00e1 Zbrojovka]] (CZ) in [[Czechoslovakia]] produced both their proprietary older models and brand new Karabiner 98k rifles, many of which were assembled from leftover German parts or using captured machinery.\n\nAs with post-Nazi occupation service post-war production of derivatives was a stop-gap solution until enough numbers of more modern automatic rifles could be developed and produced. The vast majority of the 98k pattern rifles were soon stored as reserve weapons or given for very low prices to various fledgling states or rebel movements throughout the developing world. For instance, between 1950 and 1952, an hydrid of Kar 98k and [[Vz 24]] was produced by [[Zbrojovka Brno]] for [[Bolivia]], as ''Fusil Modelo Boliviano Serie B-50''.{{sfn|Ball|2011|p=61}}\n\nBoth FN and CZ utilized a modified {{lang|de|Kriegsmodell}} design, with the cleaning rod and stock disk omitted, but the bayonet lug restored. In Czechoslovakia it was known as P-18 or pu\u0161ka vz.98N, the first being the manufacturer's cover designation of the type, the second official army designation - rifle model 98, N for n\u011bmeck\u00e1 - German.\n\n=== Yugoslavian M48 ===\nFrom 1948 to 1965, Yugoslavian Zastava Arms produced a close copy of the Karabiner 98k imported between the wars from [[Fabrique Nationale]] called the [[M48 Mauser|Model 1948]], which differed from the German rifle in that it had the shorter bolt-action of the [[FN Model 24 and Model 30#Yugoslavia 2|Yugoslav M1924]] series of rifles (not to be confused with the widely distributed Czech Vz 24, which had a standard length action), a thicker barrel profile (Yugoslavia had low [[chromium]] iron ore deposits, so they could not produce steel as hardened as the [[Krupp]] or Swedish steel used in other variants, and made up for it in adding extra material),{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} and a rear sight enclosed in the wooden hand guard (the German-style hand guard began in front of the rear sight, unlike e.g. exports to [[South America]] that had a handguard and rear sight like the M48).\n\nA hunting variant of the Yugoslavian M48 is still produced by Zastava Arms, it is designated as the Zastava Arms M70 Bolt Action Rifle now.\n\n=== Spanish M43 ===\n[[File:M43 Spanish Mauser Fabrica De Armas De La Coru\u00f1a.JPG|thumb|M43 Spanish Mauser - F\u00e1brica de Armas de la Coru\u00f1a]]\nThe Spanish M43, produced in [[A Coru\u00f1a]] from 1944 to 1958,{{sfn|Ball|2011|p=433}} was a variant of the 98k with a straight bolt handle, a front sight guard and a handle groove in the front stock much like the earlier {{lang|de|Reichspostgewehr}}.{{sfn|Ball|2011|p=358}} It was chambered in 7.92\u00d757mm Mauser calibre.

One example was Israel who used the Mauser Karabiner 98k rifle from the late 1940s until the 1970s. Their acquisition was done under Operation Balak.<ref name=\"SR\">https://silahreport.com/2019/12/26/operation-balak-the-idfs-star-of-david-on-nazi-rifles/</ref>\n\nThe use of the Karabiner 98k to establish the nation-state of Israel often raises considerable interest among people, including rifle collectors, today. Many Jewish organizations in [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] acquired them from post\u2013World War II Europe to protect various Jewish settlements from [[Arab]] attack as well as to carry out guerrilla operations against [[British Army]] forces in Palestine.\n\nThe [[Haganah]], which later evolved into the modern-day [[Israel Defense Forces]], was one of the Jewish armed groups in Palestine that brought large numbers of Mauser Karabiner 98k rifles and other surplus arms (namely the British Lee\u2013Enfield bolt-action rifle, which was used on a large scale by these groups) and the Mosin\u2013Nagant from Europe during the post\u2013World War II period. Many, though not all, Israeli-used German surplus Mauser Karabiner 98k rifles have had their [[Nazism|Nazi]] Waffenamt markings and emblems stamped over with Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] arsenal markings.\n\nAs the Arab-Israeli conflict approached, the Haganah and other Jewish forces in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] tried to get hold of as many weapons as they could in the face of an arms embargo by British colonial authorities. One of the most important purchases was a secret January 14, 1948, $12,280,000 worth contract with [[Arms shipments from Czechoslovakia to Israel 1947-1949|Czechoslovak Government]] including 4,500 P-18 rifles, as well as 50,400,000 rounds of ammunition. Later, the newly established Israel Defense Forces ordered more numbers of Mauser Karabiner 98k rifles, produced this time by Fabrique Nationale.<ref name=\"FN Israel\"/> These have Israeli and Belgian markings on the rifle as well as the emblem of the IDF on the top of the rifle's receiver. The FN-made Karabiner 98k rifles with the IDF markings and emblem on the rifle were produced and sold to Israel after it established itself as an independent nation in 1948. At some point, Israel converted all other Mauser 98-based rifles in their inventory (most commonly Czechoslovak [[vz. 24]] rifles, but small numbers of contract Mausers from sources ranging from Ethiopia to Mexico were also known to have come into Israeli hands) to the now standardized Karabiner 98k configuration. The original receiver markings of these conversions were not altered, making it easy for collectors to identify their origin. The Israeli Karabiner 98k utilized the same bayonet design as in German service, with a barrel ring added. The Israeli bayonets were a mix of converted German production and domestically produced examples.\n\nDuring the late 1950s, the IDF converted the calibre of their Mauser Karabiner 98k rifles from the original German 7.92\u00d757mm Mauser round to 7.62\u00d751mm NATO following the adoption of the [[FN FAL]] rifle as their primary rifle in 1958.{{sfn|Grant|2015|p=51}} The Israeli Mauser Karabiner 98k rifles that were converted have \"7.62\" engraved on the rifle receiver. Rifles with original German stocks have \"7.62\" burned into the heel of the rifle stock for identification and to separate the 7.62 NATO rifles from the original 7.92&nbsp;mm versions of the weapon still in service or held in reserve. Some Karabiner 98k rifles were fitted with new, unnumbered beech stocks of recent manufacture, while others retained their original furniture. All of these converted rifles were proof-fired for service. The IDF employed a [[22 mm grenade|22 mm rifle grenade]] adapter for the Mauser K98k rifle.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://bukvoed.livejournal.com/274610.html?thread=2172850 | title = Images of Israeli use of rifle grenades from 1956 onwards|date = 24 October 2014| accessdate = 13 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Karabiner 98k rifle was used by the reserve branches of the IDF well into the 1960s and 1970s and saw action in the hands of various support and line-of-communications troops during the [[Six-Day War|1967 Six-Day War]] and the [[Yom Kippur War|1973 Arab-Israeli War]].{{sfn|Grant|2015|p=51}} After the rifle was retired from reserve military service, the Israeli Mauser Karabiner 98k was given to a number of Third World nations as military aid by Israel during the 1970s and 1980s, and sold as ex-military surplus on the open market, with many Israeli Mausers being exported to Australia (the Israeli Mauser is the most predominant variant of the Mauser Kar98k rifle on the Australian surplus firearms market today) and the United States during the 1970s and 1980s.

There's a strong possibility the Mausers used by the insurgents in east Ukraine are \"Russian Capture\" Mauser rifles the Soviet Union captured, refurbished, and held in reserve during the post-WWII period.\n\n==Civil use==\n[[File:En-Mauser 98k based hunting rifle.jpg|thumb|right|Mauser Karabiner 98k based hunting rifle]]\n[[File:Mauser Kar. 98k hunting rifle.jpg|thumb|right|Privately owned Mauser Karabiner 98 kurz modified as hunting rifle, modifications have probably been made shortly after World War II]]\n[[File:Hunting with a rifle Mauser 98.JPG|thumb|right|Hunter in [[Zakarpattia Oblast]] with a Karabiner 98k in 2010]]\n\nThe Karabiner 98k rifles that were used by Germany during World War II are highly sought after collector's items in many circles. The Mauser Karabiner 98k rifle remains popular among many rifle shooters and military rifle collectors due to the rifle's historical background, as well as the availability of both new and surplus 7.92\u00d757mm IS ammunition. {{As of|2010}}, the Mauser Karabiner 98k rifles that were captured by the Soviets during World War II and refurbished during the late 1940s and early 1950s have appeared in large numbers on the military [[Surplus store|surplus]] rifle market. These have proven popular with buyers in the United States and Canada, ranging from ex-military rifle collectors to target shooters and survivalists, due to the unique history behind the Soviet capture of Mauser Karabiner 98k rifles.\n\nThe widespread availability of surplus Mauser 98k rifles and the fact that these rifles could, with relative ease, be adapted for hunting and other sport purposes made the Mauser 98k popular amongst civilian riflemen. When German hunters after World War II were allowed again to own and hunt with full bore rifles they generally started to \"rearm\" themselves with the then abundant and cheap former [[Wehrmacht]] service rifles. Civilian users [[sporterising|changed]] these service rifles often quite extensively by mounting telescopic sights, aftermarket hunting stocks, aftermarket triggers and other accessories and changing the original military chambering. Gunsmiths rebarreled or rechambered Mauser 98K rifles for European and American sporting chamberings such as the [[6.5\u00d755mm|6.5\u00d755mm Swedish Mauser]], [[7\u00d757mm Mauser]], [[7\u00d764mm]], [[.270 Winchester]], [[.308 Winchester]], .30-06 Springfield, [[8\u00d760mm S]], [[8\u00d764mm S]], etc. The magnum hunting cartridges [[6.5\u00d768mm]], [[8\u00d768mm S]] and [[9.3\u00d764mm Brenneke]] were even specially developed by German gunsmiths for the standard military Mauser 98 action.\n\nSurplus Mauser 98K actions were used by [[Schultz & Larsen]] in Denmark as the basis for [[Schultz & Larsen M52 Target Rifle|target rifles]]. The actions had the German markings removed, were refinished in gray phosphate, and new serial numbers and proof marks applied. The Schultz & Larsen M52 and M58 Target Rifles used shortened and refurbished Karabiner 98k stocks. Later versions had new target stocks fitted and were available in .30-06, 6.5\u00d755mm and 7.62mm NATO. Some of these rifles are still in competitive use today although with the benefit of new barrels. Besides conversions of original Karabiner 98k rifles other sporter variants made by a number of manufacturers such as FN Herstal, Zastava, Santa Barbara (Spain) and many others have been available at various times in a wide variety of chamberings, but most are large-bore hunting calibres.\n\n===Modern civilian offspring===\nThe Mauser-type action is widely held to be the pinnacle of bolt-action rifle design, and the vast majority of modern weapons of this type, both military and civilian, are still based on it to this day. The safety offered by its three-lug bolt and the added reliability of controlled feed (especially favored by dangerous game hunters) are considerable refinements not found in other designs.\n\nThroughout the design's history, standard sized and enlarged versions of the Mauser M 98 system have been produced for the civil market.\n\n[[John Rigby & Company|John Rigby & Co.]] commissioned Mauser to develop the M 98 magnum action in the early 1900s. It was designed to function with the large sized cartridges normally used to hunt [[Big Five game]] and other species. For this specialized type of hunting, where absolute reliability of the rifle under adverse conditions is very important, the controlled-feed M 98 system remains the standard by which other action designs are judged.<ref>[http://www.johnrigbyandco.com/html/AfricanExpressBoltRifle.html John Rigby & Co. - Rigby African Express Bolt Rifle] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713115537/http://www.johnrigbyandco.com/html/AfricanExpressBoltRifle.html |date=July 13, 2011 }}</ref> In 1911 John Rigby & Co. introduced the [[.416 Rigby]] cartridge that due to its dimensions could only be used in the M 98 magnum action.<ref name=vanWyk-MRRIGBY>{{cite journal|last=van Wyk |first=Johan |title=Mr Rigby and the Mauser |journal=African Outfitter |date=October\u2013November 2007 |volume=2/6 |url=http://www.huntinglegends.com/rigby-and-mauser/ |accessdate=19 May 2011 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110530003208/http://www.huntinglegends.com/rigby-and-mauser |archivedate=May 30, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nZastava Arms currently (2010) manufactures the M48/63 sporting rifle, which is a short-barreled variant of the Model 1948 military rifle and the [[Zastava M07]] sniper rifle.<ref>[http://www.zastava-arms.rs/cms/index.php?id=248 SPORTING RIFLE M48/63] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310000823/http://www.zastava-arms.rs/cms/index.php?id=248 |date=March 10, 2012 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.zastava-arms.rs/cms/index.php?id=184 Sniper Rifle 07] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310001020/http://www.zastava-arms.rs/cms/index.php?id=184 |date=March 10, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nSince 1999 the production of [[Mauser M 98]] and M 98 Magnum rifles has been resumed in Germany by ''Mauser Jagdwaffen GmbH''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mauserwaffen.de/Home.home.0.html?&L=1|title=Mauser Jagdwaffen GmbH|author=|date=|website=mauserwaffen.de|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519015940/http://mauserwaffen.de/Home.home.0.html?&L=1|archivedate=19 May 2011|df=}}</ref> (Mauser Huntingweapons Ltd.) according to original drawings of 1936 and the respective Mauser patents.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.all4shooters.com/en/specials/trade-shows-2015/SHOT-show-2015/shotguns/mauser-m98-magnum/ |title=Mauser M98 Magnum |website=all4shooters.com |accessdate=23 January 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206085213/http://www.all4shooters.com/en/specials/trade-shows-2015/SHOT-show-2015/shotguns/mauser-m98-magnum/ |archivedate=6 February 2015 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Users==\n[[File:Pal s bento guarda.jpg|thumb|A [[National Republican Guard (Portugal)|Portuguese Republican National Guard]] honor guard with a Kar 98k-type Mauser.]]\n<!--READ FIRST: This section is for cited entries only.

Although supplemented by semi- and fully automatic rifles during World War II, it remained the primary [[German military rifles|German service rifle]] until the end of the war in 1945. Millions were captured by the Soviets at the conclusion of World War II and were widely distributed as [[military aid]]. The Karabiner 98k therefore continues to appear in conflicts across the world as they are taken out of storage during times of strife.\n\n==History==\nIn February 1934 the ''[[Waffenamt|Heereswaffenamt]]'' (Army Weapons Agency) ordered the adoption of a new military rifle. The Karabiner 98k was derived from earlier rifles, namely the Mauser [[Standardmodell rifle|''Standardmodell'' of 1924]] and the Karabiner 98b, which in turn had both been developed from the [[Gewehr 98]]. Since the Karabiner 98k rifle was shorter than the earlier Karabiner 98b (the 98b was a [[carbine]] in name only, a version of Gewehr 98 long rifle with upgraded sights), it was given the designation ''Karabiner 98 kurz'', meaning \"Carbine 98 Short\". Just like its predecessor, the rifle was noted for its reliability, great accuracy and an effective range of up to {{convert|500|m|yards|-1}} with iron sights and {{convert|1000|m|yards|-1}} with an 8\u00d7 [[telescopic sight]].<ref name=\"bishop1998\"/>\n\nThe desire for adopting new shorter barreled rifles and the introduction of the Karabiner 98k, featuring a {{convert|600|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} long barrel, were reasons for changing the standard German service ball rifle cartridge. The 1903 pattern 7.92\u00d757mm Mauser ''S Patrone'' produced excessive muzzle flash when fired from arms that did not have a long barrel like the Gewehr 98. It was found that the ''s.S. Patrone'', originally designed for long range machine gun use, produced less muzzle flash out of rifles that had a shorter barrel and also provided better accuracy. Because of this the ''S Patrone'' was phased out in 1933 and the ''s.S. Patrone'' became the standard German service ball cartridge in the 1930s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waffen-welt.de/bilder/DiePatrone7.92x57.pdf|title=Die Patrone 7.92mm (8x57)|author=|date=|website=waffen-welt.de|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822032655/http://www.waffen-welt.de/bilder/DiePatrone7.92x57.pdf|archivedate=22 August 2016|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rifleshootermag.com/historical/20th-century-german-military-arms/|title=20th Century German Military Arms and Ammo - RifleShooter|author=|date=18 February 2016|website=rifleshootermag.com|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611031322/http://www.rifleshootermag.com/historical/20th-century-german-military-arms/|archivedate=11 June 2017|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Design details==\n===Features===\n[[File:K98kclip.jpg|thumb|right|Karabiner 98k stripper clip with five 7.92\u00d757mm Mauser cartridges]]\n[[File:Disassembled mauser long action.jpg|thumb|right|A disassembled Karabiner 98k action]]\n\nThe Karabiner 98k is a controlled-feed bolt-action rifle based on the [[Gewehr 98#M98 controlled-feed bolt-action system|Mauser M98 system]]. Its internal [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]] can be loaded with five [[7.92\u00d757mm Mauser]] cartridges from a [[stripper clip]] or one-by-one.<ref name=giwarchive>{{cite book|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=German Infantry Weapons|url=https://archive.org/stream/GermanInfantryWeapons#page/n35/mode/2up|publisher=United States War Department|page=23|date=May 25, 1943}}</ref> The straight bolt handle found on the Gewehr 98 bolt was replaced by a turned-down bolt handle on the Karabiner 98k. This change made it easier to rapidly operate the bolt, reduced the amount the handle projected beyond the receiver, and enabled mounting of aiming optics directly above the [[Receiver (firearms)|receiver]]. Each rifle was furnished with a short length of cleaning rod, fitted through the bayonet stud. The joined rods from 3 rifles provided one full-length cleaning rod.\n\nThe metal parts of the rifle were [[Bluing (steel)|blued]], a process in which steel is partially protected against rust by a layer of [[magnetite]] (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>). Such a thin [[black oxide]] layer provides only minimal protection against rust or corrosion, unless also treated with a water-displacing oil to reduce wetting and [[galvanic corrosion]]. From 1944 onwards [[phosphate conversion coating|phosphating]]/[[Parkerizing]] was introduced as a more effective metal surface treatment.<ref name=\"Karabiner 98k at www.waffenhq.de\"/>\n\n===Sights===\nThe impractical \"Langevisier\" or \"rollercoaster\" rear sight of the Mauser Gewehr 1898 was replaced with a conventional tangent leaf sight. The Karabiner 98k rear tangent sight was flatter compared to and does not obstruct the view to the sides during aiming as the ''Langevisier'' (long sight). Originally, the Karabiner 98k [[iron sight]] line had an open-pointed-post-type front sight, and a tangent-type rear sight with a V-shaped rear notch.<ref name=giwarchive/> From 1939 onwards the post front sight was hooded to reduce [[glare (vision)|glare]] under unfavourable light conditions and add protection for the post. These standard sight lines consisted of somewhat coarse aiming elements, making it suitable for rough field handling, aiming at distant area fire targets and low-light usage, but less suitable for precise aiming at distant or small point targets.  It is graduated for 7.92\u00d757mm Mauser ''s.S. Patrone'' cartridges loaded with 12.8 g (197 gr) s.S. (''schweres Spitzgescho\u00df'' \u2013 \"heavy pointed bullet\") ball bullets from {{convert|100|to|2000|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} in {{convert|100|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} increments. The sight line of early productions rifles have the ranging scale copied at the bottom of the tangent aiming element for setting the range whilst lying down. The Karabiner 98k has a {{convert|500|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} sight radius.\n\n===Stock===\nEarly Karabiner 98k rifles had solid [[Walnut#Wood|walnut wood]] or from 1943 some had solid [[oak wood]] [[Stock (firearm)#Wood stocks|one-piece stocks]]. From 1937 onwards the rifles had [[Stock (firearm)#Laminated wood|laminated stocks]], the result of trials that had stretched through the 1930s.<ref name=\"Karabiner 98k at www.waffenhq.de\"/> [[Plywood]] [[laminates]] are stronger and resisted warping better than the conventional one-piece patterns, did not require lengthy maturing, and were cheaper. The laminated stocks were, due to their dense composite structure, somewhat heavier compared to one-piece stocks.<ref name=mmrw2>{{cite book|title=Mauser Military Rifles of the World |first=Robert W.D.|last= Ball |edition =5|publisher= Gun Digest Books|year= 2011 |pages=222, 227|isbn=978-1-4402-1544-5|ref=harv }}</ref> In addition to the use of walnut and [[beech]] laminate, [[elm]] was used in small quantities.

For these differing tasks, several specialized grenades with accompanying special propelling cartridges were developed for the 1,450,113 produced ''Schiessbecher'' rifle grenade launchers. The rifle grenade-propelling cartridges fired a wooden projectile through the barrel to the rifle grenade that, upon impact, automatically primed the rifle grenade.

This ergonomic problem was solved by mounting the telescopic sight relatively high above the receiver and sometimes modifying or replacing the safety operating lever or using an offset mounting to position the telescopic sight axis to the left side in relation to the receiver center axis. A common minor modification was replacing the stock buttplate with a waffled anti-slip \"sniper\" buttplate.

The rate of fire was limited by how quickly the [[Bolt (firearm)|bolt]] could be operated. Its magazine had only half the capacity of Great Britain's [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] series rifles, but being internal, it made the weapon more comfortable to carry at its point of balance. An experimental trench magazine was produced during World War I (originally intended only for the original Gewehr 98 but it could be made to work with all Model 98 variants) that could be attached to the bottom of the internal magazine by removing the floor plate, increasing capacity to 20 rounds, though it still required loading with 5-round stripper clips.\n\nWhile the Americans had standardized a semi-automatic rifle in 1936 (the [[M1 Garand]]), the Germans maintained these bolt-action rifles due to their tactical doctrine of basing a [[Squad#Wehrmacht|squad]]'s firepower on the [[general-purpose machine gun]] in the [[light machine gun]] role so that the role of the rifleman was largely to carry ammunition and provide covering fire for the machine gunners. The advantage of the general purpose machine gun concept was that it added greatly to the overall volume of fire that could be put out by a squad-sized unit.<ref>Hogg, Ian V., & Weeks, John.

Still, it continued to be the main infantry rifle of the Wehrmacht until the end of the War. Resistance forces in German-occupied Europe made frequent use of captured German Karabiner 98k rifles. The [[Soviet Union]] also made extensive use of captured Karabiner 98k rifles and other German infantry weapons due to the [[Red Army]] experiencing a critical shortage of small arms during the early years of World War II.

The electro-penciled bolt and the X on the left side of the receiver are indicators of a Russian-captured weapon.]]\n\nDuring World War II, the Soviet Union captured millions of Mauser Karabiner 98k rifles and re-furbished them in various arms factories in the late 1940s and early 1950s. These rifles, referred to by collectors as RC (\"Russian Capture\") Mausers, can be identified by an \"X\" stamp on the left side of the receiver. The Soviet arsenals made no effort to match the rifle's original parts by serial number when reassembling them, and some metal parts (the cleaning rod, sight hood, and locking screws) were omitted after rebuilding, and instead were melted down and recycled, presumably with the other parts that weren't suitable for re-use.\n\nMany of these rifles (along with the [[Mosin\u2013Nagant]] rifle) served in conflicts after World War II. One example of Soviet-captured Mauser Kar98k rifles being used in post-WWII conflicts is the [[Korean War]], where a number of these rifles were provided by the Soviet Union (along with Soviet-made small arms) to Chinese Communist forces to supplement their supply of [[Type Zhongzheng]] rifles. Both the Soviet-capture Kar98k rifle and the Chinese Type Zhongzheng rifle were used extensively by the [[People's Volunteer Army]] throughout the course of the Korean War.\n\nThe Korean War would not be the only conflict where Soviet-capture Kar98k rifles and WWII German small arms were provided to the allies of the Soviet Union. The [[Vietnam War]] would become another example with Soviet-capture Mauser Karabiner 98k rifles being provided to [[North Vietnam]] by the USSR as military aid. Many Soviet-capture Karabiner 98k rifles (as well as some Karabiner 98k rifles that were left behind by the French after the [[First Indochina War]] and Type Zhongzheng rifles provided by the People's Republic of China) were found in the hands of [[Viet Cong]] guerrillas and [[Vietnam People's Army|People's Army of Vietnam]] (NVA) soldiers by US, South Vietnamese, South Korean, Australian and New Zealand forces alongside Soviet-bloc rifles like the Mosin\u2013Nagant, the [[SKS]], and the [[AK-47]].<ref>[http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/394026.pdf/ Operation Denver After Action Report, 1966 ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220233817/http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/394026.pdf |date=2017-02-20 }} Pg. 6, Retrieved Feb 15, 2018</ref>\n\n==== Post-occupation service ====\nIn the years after World War II, several European nations on both sides of the Iron Curtain that were invaded and occupied by Nazi Germany used the Mauser Karabiner 98k rifle as their standard-issue infantry rifle, due to the large number of German weapons that were left behind by the Germans at the end of World War II.\n\nNations like France and Norway used the Mauser Karabiner 98k rifle and other German weapons in the years after World War II. France produced a slightly modified version of the Kar 98k in the [[French occupation zone]] of Germany in the immediate post-war period. The new manufacture Kar 98ks equipped some French units that used them in [[French Indochina|Indochina]] for a limited time.<ref name=\"Grant 50\"/> Some of these rifles were also used by pro-French second-line units and Algerian independentists during [[Algerian War]].<ref name=\"Algeria\">{{cite magazine|language=fr|magazine=Gazette des Armes |issue=220 |date=March 1992|title=L'armement fran\u00e7ais en A.F.N.|pages=12\u201316|url=http://fr.1001mags.com/parution/gazette-des-armes/numero-220-mars-1992/page-14-15-texte-integral}}</ref> French Police forces, the [[Paris Police Prefecture]] and the [[Compagnies R\u00e9publicaines de S\u00e9curit\u00e9]], used 98ks from 1945 to 1992, to fire [[Tear gas|lachrymator]] and [[smoke grenade]]s.<ref name=\"CRS\">{{cite web|title=Les armes du soul\u00e8vement|url=https://www.prefecturedepolice.interieur.gouv.fr/Soulevement/Paroles/Temoignages/A-voir-les-armes-du-soulevement|website=prefecturedepolice.interieur.gouv.fr|publisher=[[Paris Police Prefecture]]|date=31 July 2014|language=fr}}</ref> These rifles were also used by West German border guards.{{sfn|Ball|2011|p=135}}\n\n[[File:Karabiner-98k-nazi-eagle.jpg|thumb|right|The emblem of Nazi Germany, eagle with [[swastika]], is still visible on many of the rifles that were used by the Norwegian military.

These Norwegian conversions had a section of the receiver flattened on the upper left side, where a new serial number (with a prefix denoting the branch of service) was stamped. Some of these rifles conversions were rechambered again to [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]],<ref name=\"Grant 50\"/> but this program was canceled with only a few thousand converted when Norway adopted the [[AG-3|AG-3 (H&K G3)]] as a replacement for both the M1 and the K98k. Some actions from Mauser Karabiner 98k left by German armed forces in 1945 were used by Kongsberg V\u00e5penfabrikk (currently Kongsberg Small Arms) for building both military and civilian sniper/target rifles under the [[Mauser M59|Kongsberg V\u00e5penfabrikk Skarpskyttergev\u00e6r M59 - Mauser M59]] and [[Mauser M67|Kongsberg V\u00e5penfabrikk Skarpskyttergev\u00e6r M67 - Mauser M67]] designations. These rifles were used by the Norwegian armed forces up to the 2000s.\n\nIn West Germany, the Karabiner 98k were issued to the [[Bundesgrenzschutz]] (BGS; {{lang-en|[[Federalism|Federal]] [[Border guard|Border Guard]]}}), which was originally organized along paramilitary lines and armed as light infantry; in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-25657503.html|title=BUNDESGRENZSCHUTZ: Bitte Einmarsch|author=|date=9 September 1953|publisher=|volume=37|accessdate=28 April 2018|via=Spiegel Online|url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427205357/http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-25657503.html|archivedate=27 April 2017|df=}}</ref>\n\nFormer German Karabiner 98k rifles were widely distributed throughout the Eastern Bloc, some being refurbished two or three times by different factories. They were used by military and para-military forces (such as the [[East Germany|East German]] [[Combat Groups of the Working Class]]), and were replaced by Soviet weapons in the 1960s.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-85458-0003, Berlin, Mauerbau, Kampfgruppen, NVA, VP.jpg|thumb|[[East Germany|East German]] members of the [[Combat Groups of the Working Class]] and [[Border Troops of the German Democratic Republic|Border Troops]] at the border of the Berlin sector in 1961. The Combat Group members are equipped with Karabiner 98k rifles.]]\n\nEast German refurbished Karabiner 98ks featured Russian-style thicker blue finish, a 'sunburst' proof mark and sometimes had the factory designation '1001' applied, which was the factory where the refurbishment was carried out. Numbers were re-stamped to match the receiver and old numbers barred out. Numbers of East German and Czech refurbished Karabiner 98ks were exported to the West in the late 1980s and early 1990s and are now in the hands of collectors. Russian Capture Karabiner 98ks were exported to the West in large numbers in the early and mid-2000s.\n\n==== Yugoslavian postwar refurbishment ====\n{{main|Zastava M 98/48}}\nBecause of the lack of weapons after World War II, the [[Yugoslavia]]n arms producer Crvena Zastava (Nowadays [[Zastava Arms]]) refurbished German Karabiner 98k rifles that were left over or captured during the war. These rifles are readily identifiable as the German factory code markings have been scrubbed from the receiver and replaced with the Yugoslavian communist crest and the marking \"Preduze\u0107e 44\" on the receiver's ring. In addition to this, if the refurbishment took place after 1950, the marking \"/48\" was added to the \"Mod. 98\" originally present on the left side of the receiver, becoming \"Mod. 98/48\". The refurbished rifles were known also as [[Zastava M 98/48]]. The refurbished Pr\u0435duze\u0107e 44 Karabiner 98k rifles were still being used in the [[Yugoslav Wars]] of the 1990s.\n\n== Post\u2013World War II derivatives ==\nMany of the liberated European countries continued production of rifles similar to the Karabiner 98k, for example [[Fabrique Nationale de Herstal|Fabrique Nationale]] (FN) in Belgium<ref name=\"FN Israel\">{{cite web|title= Karabiner 98k (Israel)|url=https://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/30029770|website=iwm.org.uk|publisher=[[Imperial War Museum]]}}</ref> and [[\u010cesk\u00e1 zbrojovka firearms|\u010cesk\u00e1 Zbrojovka]] (CZ) in [[Czechoslovakia]] produced both their proprietary older models and brand new Karabiner 98k rifles, many of which were assembled from leftover German parts or using captured machinery.\n\nAs with post-Nazi occupation service post-war production of derivatives was a stop-gap solution until enough numbers of more modern automatic rifles could be developed and produced. The vast majority of the 98k pattern rifles were soon stored as reserve weapons or given for very low prices to various fledgling states or rebel movements throughout the developing world. For instance, between 1950 and 1952, an hydrid of Kar 98k and [[Vz 24]] was produced by [[Zbrojovka Brno]] for [[Bolivia]], as ''Fusil Modelo Boliviano Serie B-50''.{{sfn|Ball|2011|p=61}}\n\nBoth FN and CZ utilized a modified {{lang|de|Kriegsmodell}} design, with the cleaning rod and stock disk omitted, but the bayonet lug restored. In Czechoslovakia it was known as P-18 or pu\u0161ka vz.98N, the first being the manufacturer's cover designation of the type, the second official army designation - rifle model 98, N for n\u011bmeck\u00e1 - German.\n\n=== Yugoslavian M48 ===\nFrom 1948 to 1965, Yugoslavian Zastava Arms produced a close copy of the Karabiner 98k imported between the wars from [[Fabrique Nationale]] called the [[M48 Mauser|Model 1948]], which differed from the German rifle in that it had the shorter bolt-action of the [[FN Model 24 and Model 30#Yugoslavia 2|Yugoslav M1924]] series of rifles (not to be confused with the widely distributed Czech Vz 24, which had a standard length action), a thicker barrel profile (Yugoslavia had low [[chromium]] iron ore deposits, so they could not produce steel as hardened as the [[Krupp]] or Swedish steel used in other variants, and made up for it in adding extra material),{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} and a rear sight enclosed in the wooden hand guard (the German-style hand guard began in front of the rear sight, unlike e.g. exports to [[South America]] that had a handguard and rear sight like the M48).\n\nA hunting variant of the Yugoslavian M48 is still produced by Zastava Arms, it is designated as the Zastava Arms M70 Bolt Action Rifle now.\n\n=== Spanish M43 ===\n[[File:M43 Spanish Mauser Fabrica De Armas De La Coru\u00f1a.JPG|thumb|M43 Spanish Mauser - F\u00e1brica de Armas de la Coru\u00f1a]]\nThe Spanish M43, produced in [[A Coru\u00f1a]] from 1944 to 1958,{{sfn|Ball|2011|p=433}} was a variant of the 98k with a straight bolt handle, a front sight guard and a handle groove in the front stock much like the earlier {{lang|de|Reichspostgewehr}}.{{sfn|Ball|2011|p=358}} It was chambered in 7.92\u00d757mm Mauser calibre.

One example was Israel who used the Mauser Karabiner 98k rifle from the late 1940s until the 1970s. Their acquisition was done under Operation Balak.<ref name=\"SR\">https://silahreport.com/2019/12/26/operation-balak-the-idfs-star-of-david-on-nazi-rifles/</ref>\n\nThe use of the Karabiner 98k to establish the nation-state of Israel often raises considerable interest among people, including rifle collectors, today. Many Jewish organizations in [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] acquired them from post\u2013World War II Europe to protect various Jewish settlements from [[Arab]] attack as well as to carry out guerrilla operations against [[British Army]] forces in Palestine.\n\nThe [[Haganah]], which later evolved into the modern-day [[Israel Defense Forces]], was one of the Jewish armed groups in Palestine that brought large numbers of Mauser Karabiner 98k rifles and other surplus arms (namely the British Lee\u2013Enfield bolt-action rifle, which was used on a large scale by these groups) and the Mosin\u2013Nagant from Europe during the post\u2013World War II period. Many, though not all, Israeli-used German surplus Mauser Karabiner 98k rifles have had their [[Nazism|Nazi]] Waffenamt markings and emblems stamped over with Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] arsenal markings.\n\nAs the Arab-Israeli conflict approached, the Haganah and other Jewish forces in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] tried to get hold of as many weapons as they could in the face of an arms embargo by British colonial authorities. One of the most important purchases was a secret January 14, 1948, $12,280,000 worth contract with [[Arms shipments from Czechoslovakia to Israel 1947-1949|Czechoslovak Government]] including 4,500 P-18 rifles, as well as 50,400,000 rounds of ammunition. Later, the newly established Israel Defense Forces ordered more numbers of Mauser Karabiner 98k rifles, produced this time by Fabrique Nationale.<ref name=\"FN Israel\"/> These have Israeli and Belgian markings on the rifle as well as the emblem of the IDF on the top of the rifle's receiver. The FN-made Karabiner 98k rifles with the IDF markings and emblem on the rifle were produced and sold to Israel after it established itself as an independent nation in 1948. At some point, Israel converted all other Mauser 98-based rifles in their inventory (most commonly Czechoslovak [[vz. 24]] rifles, but small numbers of contract Mausers from sources ranging from Ethiopia to Mexico were also known to have come into Israeli hands) to the now standardized Karabiner 98k configuration. The original receiver markings of these conversions were not altered, making it easy for collectors to identify their origin. The Israeli Karabiner 98k utilized the same bayonet design as in German service, with a barrel ring added. The Israeli bayonets were a mix of converted German production and domestically produced examples.\n\nDuring the late 1950s, the IDF converted the calibre of their Mauser Karabiner 98k rifles from the original German 7.92\u00d757mm Mauser round to 7.62\u00d751mm NATO following the adoption of the [[FN FAL]] rifle as their primary rifle in 1958.{{sfn|Grant|2015|p=51}} The Israeli Mauser Karabiner 98k rifles that were converted have \"7.62\" engraved on the rifle receiver. Rifles with original German stocks have \"7.62\" burned into the heel of the rifle stock for identification and to separate the 7.62 NATO rifles from the original 7.92&nbsp;mm versions of the weapon still in service or held in reserve. Some Karabiner 98k rifles were fitted with new, unnumbered beech stocks of recent manufacture, while others retained their original furniture. All of these converted rifles were proof-fired for service. The IDF employed a [[22 mm grenade|22 mm rifle grenade]] adapter for the Mauser K98k rifle.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://bukvoed.livejournal.com/274610.html?thread=2172850 | title = Images of Israeli use of rifle grenades from 1956 onwards|date = 24 October 2014| accessdate = 13 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Karabiner 98k rifle was used by the reserve branches of the IDF well into the 1960s and 1970s and saw action in the hands of various support and line-of-communications troops during the [[Six-Day War|1967 Six-Day War]] and the [[Yom Kippur War|1973 Arab-Israeli War]].{{sfn|Grant|2015|p=51}} After the rifle was retired from reserve military service, the Israeli Mauser Karabiner 98k was given to a number of Third World nations as military aid by Israel during the 1970s and 1980s, and sold as ex-military surplus on the open market, with many Israeli Mausers being exported to Australia (the Israeli Mauser is the most predominant variant of the Mauser Kar98k rifle on the Australian surplus firearms market today) and the United States during the 1970s and 1980s.

There's a strong possibility the Mausers used by the insurgents in east Ukraine are \"Russian Capture\" Mauser rifles the Soviet Union captured, refurbished, and held in reserve during the post-WWII period.\n\n==Civil use==\n[[File:En-Mauser 98k based hunting rifle.jpg|thumb|right|Mauser Karabiner 98k based hunting rifle]]\n[[File:Mauser Kar. 98k hunting rifle.jpg|thumb|right|Privately owned Mauser Karabiner 98 kurz modified as hunting rifle, modifications have probably been made shortly after World War II]]\n[[File:Hunting with a rifle Mauser 98.JPG|thumb|right|Hunter in [[Zakarpattia Oblast]] with a Karabiner 98k in 2010]]\n\nThe Karabiner 98k rifles that were used by Germany during World War II are highly sought after collector's items in many circles. The Mauser Karabiner 98k rifle remains popular among many rifle shooters and military rifle collectors due to the rifle's historical background, as well as the availability of both new and surplus 7.92\u00d757mm IS ammunition. {{As of|2010}}, the Mauser Karabiner 98k rifles that were captured by the Soviets during World War II and refurbished during the late 1940s and early 1950s have appeared in large numbers on the military [[Surplus store|surplus]] rifle market. These have proven popular with buyers in the United States and Canada, ranging from ex-military rifle collectors to target shooters and survivalists, due to the unique history behind the Soviet capture of Mauser Karabiner 98k rifles.\n\nThe widespread availability of surplus Mauser 98k rifles and the fact that these rifles could, with relative ease, be adapted for hunting and other sport purposes made the Mauser 98k popular amongst civilian riflemen. When German hunters after World War II were allowed again to own and hunt with full bore rifles they generally started to \"rearm\" themselves with the then abundant and cheap former [[Wehrmacht]] service rifles. Civilian users [[sporterising|changed]] these service rifles often quite extensively by mounting telescopic sights, aftermarket hunting stocks, aftermarket triggers and other accessories and changing the original military chambering. Gunsmiths rebarreled or rechambered Mauser 98K rifles for European and American sporting chamberings such as the [[6.5\u00d755mm|6.5\u00d755mm Swedish Mauser]], [[7\u00d757mm Mauser]], [[7\u00d764mm]], [[.270 Winchester]], [[.308 Winchester]], .30-06 Springfield, [[8\u00d760mm S]], [[8\u00d764mm S]], etc. The magnum hunting cartridges [[6.5\u00d768mm]], [[8\u00d768mm S]] and [[9.3\u00d764mm Brenneke]] were even specially developed by German gunsmiths for the standard military Mauser 98 action.\n\nSurplus Mauser 98K actions were used by [[Schultz & Larsen]] in Denmark as the basis for [[Schultz & Larsen M52 Target Rifle|target rifles]]. The actions had the German markings removed, were refinished in gray phosphate, and new serial numbers and proof marks applied. The Schultz & Larsen M52 and M58 Target Rifles used shortened and refurbished Karabiner 98k stocks. Later versions had new target stocks fitted and were available in .30-06, 6.5\u00d755mm and 7.62mm NATO. Some of these rifles are still in competitive use today although with the benefit of new barrels. Besides conversions of original Karabiner 98k rifles other sporter variants made by a number of manufacturers such as FN Herstal, Zastava, Santa Barbara (Spain) and many others have been available at various times in a wide variety of chamberings, but most are large-bore hunting calibres.\n\n===Modern civilian offspring===\nThe Mauser-type action is widely held to be the pinnacle of bolt-action rifle design, and the vast majority of modern weapons of this type, both military and civilian, are still based on it to this day. The safety offered by its three-lug bolt and the added reliability of controlled feed (especially favored by dangerous game hunters) are considerable refinements not found in other designs.\n\nThroughout the design's history, standard sized and enlarged versions of the Mauser M 98 system have been produced for the civil market.\n\n[[John Rigby & Company|John Rigby & Co.]] commissioned Mauser to develop the M 98 magnum action in the early 1900s. It was designed to function with the large sized cartridges normally used to hunt [[Big Five game]] and other species. For this specialized type of hunting, where absolute reliability of the rifle under adverse conditions is very important, the controlled-feed M 98 system remains the standard by which other action designs are judged.<ref>[http://www.johnrigbyandco.com/html/AfricanExpressBoltRifle.html John Rigby & Co. - Rigby African Express Bolt Rifle] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713115537/http://www.johnrigbyandco.com/html/AfricanExpressBoltRifle.html |date=July 13, 2011 }}</ref> In 1911 John Rigby & Co. introduced the [[.416 Rigby]] cartridge that due to its dimensions could only be used in the M 98 magnum action.<ref name=vanWyk-MRRIGBY>{{cite journal|last=van Wyk |first=Johan |title=Mr Rigby and the Mauser |journal=African Outfitter |date=October\u2013November 2007 |volume=2/6 |url=http://www.huntinglegends.com/rigby-and-mauser/ |accessdate=19 May 2011 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110530003208/http://www.huntinglegends.com/rigby-and-mauser |archivedate=May 30, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nZastava Arms currently (2010) manufactures the M48/63 sporting rifle, which is a short-barreled variant of the Model 1948 military rifle and the [[Zastava M07]] sniper rifle.<ref>[http://www.zastava-arms.rs/cms/index.php?id=248 SPORTING RIFLE M48/63] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310000823/http://www.zastava-arms.rs/cms/index.php?id=248 |date=March 10, 2012 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.zastava-arms.rs/cms/index.php?id=184 Sniper Rifle 07] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310001020/http://www.zastava-arms.rs/cms/index.php?id=184 |date=March 10, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nSince 1999 the production of [[Mauser M 98]] and M 98 Magnum rifles has been resumed in Germany by ''Mauser Jagdwaffen GmbH''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mauserwaffen.de/Home.home.0.html?&L=1|title=Mauser Jagdwaffen GmbH|author=|date=|website=mauserwaffen.de|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519015940/http://mauserwaffen.de/Home.home.0.html?&L=1|archivedate=19 May 2011|df=}}</ref> (Mauser Huntingweapons Ltd.) according to original drawings of 1936 and the respective Mauser patents.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.all4shooters.com/en/specials/trade-shows-2015/SHOT-show-2015/shotguns/mauser-m98-magnum/ |title=Mauser M98 Magnum |website=all4shooters.com |accessdate=23 January 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206085213/http://www.all4shooters.com/en/specials/trade-shows-2015/SHOT-show-2015/shotguns/mauser-m98-magnum/ |archivedate=6 February 2015 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Users==\n[[File:Pal s bento guarda.jpg|thumb|A [[National Republican Guard (Portugal)|Portuguese Republican National Guard]] honor guard with a Kar 98k-type Mauser.]]\n<!--READ FIRST: This section is for cited entries only.

The community is named after the Crowned King mine, but the name was shortened to Crown King in 1888. [[Horsethief Basin Lake]] resides 6.5 miles southeast of Crown King on Crown King Rd/Forest 259 Rd.\n\n== History ==\n\nAn estimated [[US$]]2,000,000 in gold was taken from the Crowned King Mine alone; the mines have been closed since the 1950s and for the past half-century tourism has been the only reliable source of income in the area, despite the fact that the unpaved, mountainous access roads are rocky, rough and slow to drive.\n\nThe first recorded gold claim in Crown King was \"Buckeye\" and was filed by Rod McKinnon on July 1, 1875. Over the next 40 years, more than 15 mines or claims were made in the area. At its height, the town had 500 buildings, including several company stores and boarding houses, two Chinese restaurants and a post office. The town was electrified by 1897 and had one telephone at that time.\n\nWhile an active mining town, Crown King was served by the [[Bradshaw Mountain Railroad]]. Rail service to the area began in 1904 upon completion of \"[[Murphy's Impossible Railroad]]\" \u2014 a series of switchbacks and trestles that ascended the mountain terrain between [[Cleator, Arizona|Cleator]] and Crown King. The railroad began in Mayer, Arizona, connecting with Murphy's Prescott & Eastern and extended for 28 miles amid the rocky terrain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mininghistoryassociation.org/CrownKing.htm|title=Crown King Arizona Mining History|website=www.mininghistoryassociation.org|access-date=2019-04-19}}</ref>\n\nCrown King was the terminus (1904\u20131926) of the railroad, built by [[Frank M. Murphy]] to serve the mines of the southern [[Bradshaw Mountains]]. However, these mines were never very productive, and the BMRR was a financial failure. The line was abandoned in 1926. Much of the road to Crown King uses the old railroad bed.<ref>John W. Sayre, 1985, '''Ghost Railroads of Central Arizona,''' Boulder, Colo.: Pruett, {{ISBN|0-87108-683-2}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Crown King Saloon at dusk.jpg|thumbnail|left|Crown King Saloon]]\nOf the buildings still standing and in use in Crown King, the Crown King Saloon has maintained its place as the center of activity in town. The Saloon was originally constructed and operated in the nearby mining town of Oro Belle (now also a ghost town). In 1910, it was disassembled and brought to Crown King piece by piece after the mine at Oro Belle had played out. The building was home to a brothel and bar in both towns and now serves the public as a hotel, cafe, and bar.\n\nThe red one-room schoolhouse was built in 1917 and still serves a small number of K-8 students. High school students typically leave town to attend class 14 miles away in [[Mayer, AZ|Mayer.]]\n\nThe post office was established on July 29, 1888, and was discontinued on May 15, 1954.<ref name=\"sherman\">{{cite book|title=Ghost Towns of Arizona|last=Sherman|first=James E.|author2=Barbara H.

The community is named after the Crowned King mine, but the name was shortened to Crown King in 1888. [[Horsethief Basin Lake]] resides 6.5 miles southeast of Crown King on Crown King Rd/Forest 259 Rd.\n\n== History ==\n\nAn estimated [[US$]]2,000,000 in gold was taken from the Crowned King Mine alone; the mines have been closed since the 1950s and for the past half-century tourism has been the only reliable source of income in the area, despite the fact that the unpaved, mountainous access roads are rocky, rough and slow to drive.\n\nThe first recorded gold claim in Crown King was \"Buckeye\" and was filed by Rod McKinnon on July 1, 1875. Over the next 40 years, more than 15 mines or claims were made in the area. At its height, the town had 500 buildings, including several company stores and boarding houses, two Chinese restaurants and a post office. The town was electrified by 1897 and had one telephone at that time.\n\nWhile an active mining town, Crown King was served by the [[Bradshaw Mountain Railroad]]. Rail service to the area began in 1904 upon completion of \"[[Murphy's Impossible Railroad]]\" \u2014 a series of switchbacks and trestles that ascended the mountain terrain between [[Cleator, Arizona|Cleator]] and Crown King. The railroad began in Mayer, Arizona, connecting with Murphy's Prescott & Eastern and extended for 28 miles amid the rocky terrain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mininghistoryassociation.org/CrownKing.htm|title=Crown King Arizona Mining History|website=www.mininghistoryassociation.org|access-date=2019-04-19}}</ref>\n\nCrown King was the terminus (1904\u20131926) of the railroad, built by [[Frank M. Murphy]] to serve the mines of the southern [[Bradshaw Mountains]]. However, these mines were never very productive, and the BMRR was a financial failure. The line was abandoned in 1926. Much of the road to Crown King uses the old railroad bed.<ref>John W. Sayre, 1985, '''Ghost Railroads of Central Arizona,''' Boulder, Colo.: Pruett, {{ISBN|0-87108-683-2}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Crown King Saloon at dusk.jpg|thumbnail|left|Crown King Saloon]]\nOf the buildings still standing and in use in Crown King, the Crown King Saloon has maintained its place as the center of activity in town. The Saloon was originally constructed and operated in the nearby mining town of Oro Belle (now also a ghost town). In 1910, it was disassembled and brought to Crown King piece by piece after the mine at Oro Belle had played out. The building was home to a brothel and bar in both towns and now serves the public as a hotel, cafe, and bar.\n\nThe red one-room schoolhouse was built in 1917 and still serves a small number of K-8 students. High school students typically leave town to attend class 14 miles away in [[Mayer, AZ|Mayer.]]\n\nThe post office was established on July 29, 1888, and was discontinued on May 15, 1954.<ref name=\"sherman\">{{cite book|title=Ghost Towns of Arizona|last=Sherman|first=James E.|author2=Barbara H.

When she had completed her school education, she served as a housemaid for a clergyman in the north of [[Jutland]] where, in addition to housekeeping, she learnt skills normally reserved for men, including painting, white-washing, varnishing and chopping wood. The clergyman also taught her French and astronomy.<ref name=kvinfo/>\n\nOn a trip to the United States in 1893, she met the influential Danish-American author Baron Joost Dahlerup.
