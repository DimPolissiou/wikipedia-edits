{"title_page": "Copper in heat exchangers", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}\n[[Heat exchanger]]s are devices that transfer heat to achieve desired heating or cooling. An important design aspect of heat exchanger technology is the selection of appropriate materials to conduct and transfer heat fast and efficiently.\n\nCopper has many desirable properties for thermally efficient and durable [[heat exchangers]]. First and foremost, copper is an excellent conductor of heat. This means that copper's high [[thermal conductivity]] allows heat to pass through it quickly.

Some alternative materials include aluminium, [[carbon steel]], [[stainless steel]], [[List of alloys|nickel alloys]], and [[titanium]].\n\nThis article focuses on beneficial properties and common applications of copper in heat exchangers.  New copper heat exchanger technologies for specific applications are also introduced.\n\n==History==\nHeat exchangers using copper and its alloys have evolved along with heat transfer technologies over the past several hundred years. Copper condenser tubes were first used in 1769 for [[steam engine]]s. Initially, the tubes were made of unalloyed copper. By 1870, [[Muntz metal]], a 60% Cu-40% Zn [[brass]] alloy, was used for condensers in seawater cooling. Admiralty metal, a 70% Cu-30% Zn yellow brass alloy with 1% [[tin]] added to improve corrosion resistance, was introduced in 1890 for seawater service.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Gaffoglio, Carl J., Copper alloy surface condenser tube application and service considerations; CDA Heat Exchange Seminars; Copper Development Association</ref> By the 1920s, a 70% Cu-30% Ni alloy was developed for naval condensers. Soon afterwards, a 2% [[manganese]] and 2% iron copper alloy was introduced for better erosion resistance. A 90% Cu-10% Ni alloy first became available in the 1950s, initially for seawater piping. This alloy is now the most widely used copper-nickel alloy in marine heat exchangers.\n\nToday, steam, evaporator, and condenser coils are made from copper and copper alloys.<ref name=\"srcoils.com\">{{cite web|title = Coils |publisher = Super Radiator Coils |url =https://www.superradiatorcoils.com/userAssets/Coil-Product-Brochure-4th-Edition-DEC-2017_Web.pdf }}</ref> These heat exchangers are used in [[air conditioning]] and [[refrigeration]] systems, industrial and central heating and cooling systems, [[radiator]]s, [[hot water tank]]s, and under-floor heating systems.\n\nCopper-based heat exchangers can be manufactured with copper tube/aluminium fin, cupro-nickel, or all-copper constructions. Various coatings can be applied to enhance corrosion resistance of the tubes and fins.<ref name=\"srcoils.com\"/><ref>10 tips on getting the most from your coil; Super Radiator Coils; http://www.srcoils.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2010/05/T003-10-Tips.pdf{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Beneficial properties of copper heat exchangers==\n\n===Thermal conductivity===\nThermal conductivity (k, also denoted as \u03bb or \u03ba) is a measure of a material's ability to conduct [[heat conduction|heat]]. Heat transfer across materials of high thermal conductivity occurs at a higher rate than across materials of low thermal conductivity. In the [[International System of Units]] (SI), thermal conductivity is measured in watts per meter Kelvin (W/(m\u2022K)). In the Imperial System of Measurement (British Imperial, or [[Imperial units]]), thermal conductivity is measured in Btu/(hr\u2022ft\u22c5F).\n\nCopper has a thermal conductivity of 231 Btu/(hr-ft-F). This is higher than all other metals except silver, a [[precious metal]]. Copper has a 60% better thermal conductivity rating than aluminium and a 3,000% better rating than stainless steel.<ref>{{cite journal |title =Materials for thermal conduction |year=2001|last= Chung|first= DDL|journal = Applied Thermal Engineering|volume = 21|pages= 1593\u20131605|url = http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~ddlchung/Materials%20for%20thermal%20conduction.pdf|doi=10.1016/s1359-4311(01)00042-4}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\nThermal conductivity of some common metals<ref>{{cite web|title =Thermal Properties of Metals, Conductivity, Thermal Expansion, Specific Heat|website= Engineer's Edge |url = http://www.engineersedge.com/properties_of_metals.htm}}</ref>\n\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Metal\t\t\t\n! colspan=\"2\" | Thermal conductivity\n|-\n!

However, the thermal conductivity of stainless steel is 1/30th that of copper. Aluminium tubes are not suitable for potable or untreated water applications because it corrodes at pH<7.0 and releases hydrogen gas.<ref name=\"brazetek.com\">Finned coil heat exchangers (water to air heat exchangers); Brazetek; http://www.brazetek.com/water-to-air-heat-exchangers</ref><ref>T.E.

For certain applications, the film is composed of iron. In power plant condensers, duplex tubes consisting of an inner titanium layer with outer copper-nickel alloys are employed. This enables the use of copper\u2019s beneficial mechanical and chemical properties (e.g., stress corrosion cracking, ammonia attack) along with titanium\u2019s excellent corrosion resistance. A duplex tube with inner aluminium brass or copper-nickel and outer stainless or mild steel can be used for cooling in the oil refining and petrochemical industries.<ref name=\"shinkometal.co.jp\">Kobelco: Copper alloy tubes for heat-exchanger; Shinko Metal Products, Japan; http://www.shinkometal.co.jp/catalog/copperalloy-en-sc.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029202052/http://www.shinkometal.co.jp/catalog/copperalloy-en-sc.pdf |date=29 October 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===Biofouling resistance===\nCopper and copper-nickel alloys have a high natural resistance to biofouling relative to alternative materials. Other metals used in heat exchangers, such as steel, titanium and aluminium, foul readily. Protection against biofouling, particularly in marine structures, can be accomplished over long periods of time with copper metals.\n\nCopper-nickel alloys have been proven over many years in sea water pipework and other marine applications. These alloys resist biofouling in open seas where they do not allow microbial slime to build up and support macrofouling.<ref>Powell, C.A.; Preventing biofouling with copper-nickel; Copper Development Association, October 2002; {{cite web |url=http://www.copperinfo.co.uk/alloys/copper-nickel/downloads/pub-157-preventing-biofouling-with-copper-nickel.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=26 November 2012 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030065725/http://www.copperinfo.co.uk/alloys/copper-nickel/downloads/pub-157-preventing-biofouling-with-copper-nickel.pdf |archivedate=30 October 2012 |df= }}</ref>\n\nResearchers attribute copper's resistance to biofouling, even in temperate waters, to two possible mechanisms: 1) a retarding sequence of colonization through slow release of copper ions during the corrosion process, thereby inhibiting the attachment of microbial layers to marine surfaces;<ref>Sutherland, I.W., 1983, Microbial exopolysaccarides: Their role in microbial adhesion in aqueous systems, Critical Reviews in Microbiology, Vol. 10, pp.173\u2013201</ref> and/or, 2) separating layers that contain corrosive products and the larvae of macro-encrusting organisms.<ref name=\"autogenerated1995\">Edding, Mario E., Flores, Hector, and Miranda, Claudio, (1995), Experimental Usage of Copper-Nickel Alloy Mesh in Mariculture.

Hence, the surfaces of copper-based heat exchangers are cleaner for longer periods of time than heat exchangers made from other metals. This benefit offers a greatly expanded heat exchanger service life and contributes to improved air quality.\nHeat exchangers fabricated separately from antimicrobial copper and aluminium in a full-scale HVAC system have been evaluated for their ability to limit microbial growth under conditions of normal flow rates using single-pass outside air. Commonly used aluminium components developed stable biofilms of bacteria and fungi within four weeks of operation. During the same time period, antimicrobial copper was able to limit bacterial loads associated with the copper heat exchanger fins by 99.99% and fungal loads by 99.74%.<ref>Michels, H. (2011).

Copper heat exchangers are important in solar thermal heating and cooling systems because of copper's high thermal conductivity, resistance to atmospheric and water corrosion, sealing and joining by soldering, and mechanical strength. Copper is used both in receivers and in primary circuits (pipes and heat exchangers for water tanks) of solar thermal water systems.<ref>2011 global status report by Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century (REN21)); {{cite web|url=http://www.ren21.net/default.aspx?tabid%3D5434 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=26 November 2012 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103024143/http://www.ren21.net/default.aspx?tabid=5434 |archivedate=3 November 2012 |df= }}</ref>\n\nVarious types of solar collectors for residential applications are available with either direct circulation (i.e., heats water and brings it directly to the home for use) or indirect circulation (i.e., pumps a heat transfer fluid through a heat exchanger, which then heats water that flows into the home) systems.<ref>Solar water heaters; Energy Savers; Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy; U.S. Department of Energy; http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/water_heating/index.cfm/mytopic=12850/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825233625/http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/water_heating/index.cfm/mytopic=12850 |date=25 August 2012 }}</ref> In an evacuated tube solar hot water heater with an indirect circulation system, the evacuated tubes contain a glass outer tube and metal absorber tube attached to a fin. Solar thermal energy is absorbed within the evacuated tubes and is converted into usable concentrated heat. Evacuated glass tubes have a double layer. Inside the glass tube is the copper heat pipe. It is a sealed hollow copper tube that contains a small amount of thermal transfer fluid (water or glycol mixture) which under low pressure boils at a very low temperature. The copper heat pipe transfers thermal energy from within the solar tube into a copper header. As the solution circulates through the copper header, the temperature rises.\n\nOther components in solar thermal water systems that contain copper include solar heat exchanger tanks and solar pumping stations, along with pumps and controllers.<ref>Solar hot water; B&R Service Inc.; http://www.bandrservice.com/solar.htm</ref><ref>How solar hot water system works; SolarPlusGreen.com; http://www.solarplusgreen.com/solar-know-how.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904220147/http://www.solarplusgreen.com/solar-know-how.htm# |date=4 September 2012 }}</ref><ref>Mirasol Solar Energy Systems; http://www.mirasolenergysystems.com/pdf/et-technology.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104014440/http://www.mirasolenergysystems.com/pdf/et-technology.pdf |date=4 November 2013 }}</ref><ref>How solar heaters work; Mayca Solar Energy; {{cite web |url=http://www.maycasolar.com/techinfo.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=26 November 2012 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028203532/http://www.maycasolar.com/techinfo.asp |archivedate=28 October 2012 |df= }}</ref><ref>Bayat Energy: solar water heaters; http://www.bayatenergy.co.uk/Solar%20Water%20Heaters%20Catalogue.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103191342/http://www.bayatenergy.co.uk/Solar%20Water%20Heaters%20Catalogue.pdf# |date=3 November 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===HVAC systems===\n[[Air conditioning]] and heating in [[buildings]] and [[motor vehicles]] are two of the largest applications for [[heat exchangers]].

Gas-water heat exchangers that transfer heat from gaseous fuels to water between 3 and 300 kilowatts thermal (kWth) have widespread residential and commercial use in water heating and heating boiler appliance applications.\n\nDemand is increasing for energy-efficient compact water heating systems. Tankless gas water heaters produce hot water when needed. Copper heat exchangers are the preferred material in these units because of their high thermal conductivity and ease of fabrication. To protect these units in [[acid]]ic environments, durable coatings or other surface treatments are available. Acid-resistant coatings are capable of withstanding temperatures of 1000&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>Gas water heaters with improved heat exchangers; http://copperalliance.org/core-initiatives/technology/technology-projects/</ref><ref>Gas Combustion Equipment; http://copperalliance.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2012/06/technology_roadmap-en.pdf{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Forced air heating and cooling===\nAir-source heat pumps have been used for residential and commercial heating and cooling for many years. These units rely on air-to-air heat exchange through evaporator units similar to those used for air conditioners. Finned water to air heat exchangers are most commonly used for forced air heating and cooling systems, such as with indoor and outdoor wood furnaces, boilers, and stoves. They can also be suitable for liquid cooling applications. Copper is specified in supply and return manifolds and in tube coils.<ref name=\"brazetek.com\"/>\n\n===Direct Exchange (DX) Geothermal Heating/Cooling===\n[[Geothermal]] heat pump technology, variously known as \"ground source,\" \"earth-coupled,\" or \"direct exchange,\" relies on circulating a refrigerant through buried copper tubing for heat exchange. These units, which are considerably more efficient than their air-source counterparts, rely on the constancy of ground temperatures below the [[frost]] zone for heat transfer.\nThe most efficient ground source heat pumps use ACR, Type L or special-size copper tubing buried into the ground to transfer heat to or from the conditioned space. Flexible copper tube (typically 1/4-inch to 5/8-inch) can be buried in deep vertical holes, horizontally in a relatively shallow grid pattern, in a vertical fence-like arrangement in medium-depth trenches, or as custom configurations. Further information is available.<ref>Copper DX geothermal heat pump; Copper Development Association; http://www.copper.org/applications/plumbing/heatpump/dxhp_main.html</ref>\n\n===Electronic systems===\nCopper and aluminium are used as [[heat sinks]] and [[heat pipes]] in [[electronics|electronic]] cooling applications. A [[heat sink]] is a passive component that cools [[semiconductor]] and [[optoelectronic]] devices by dissipating heat into the surrounding air. Heat sinks have temperatures higher than their surrounding environments so that heat can be transferred into the air by [[convection]], [[radiation]], and [[conduction (heat)|conduction]].\n\nAluminium is the most prominently used heat sink material because of its lower cost.<ref>Thermal Solutions Intl., Copper heatsinks; http://www.thermal-solutions.us/copper-heatsinks.html</ref> Copper heat sinks are a necessity when higher levels of thermal conductivity are needed. An alternative to all-copper or all-aluminium heat sinks is the joining of aluminium fins to a copper base.<ref>Cooliance; Copper heat sinks; {{cite web |url=http://www.cooliance.com/resources/copper-heatsinks.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=10 February 2015 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011082149/http://www.cooliance.com/resources/copper-heatsinks.html |archivedate=11 October 2014 |df= }}</ref>\n\nCopper heat sinks are die-cast and bound together in plates. They spread heat quickly from the heat source to copper or aluminium fins and into the surrounding air.\n\nHeat pipes are used to move heat away from [[central processing units]] (CPUs) and [[graphics processing units]] (GPUs) and towards heat sinks, where thermal energy is dissipated into the environment. Copper and aluminium heat pipes are used extensively in modern computer systems where increased power requirements and associated heat emissions result in greater demands on cooling systems.\n\nA heat pipe typically consists of a sealed pipe or tube at both the hot and cold ends. Heat pipes utilize [[evaporative cooling]] to transfer thermal energy from one point to another by the evaporation and condensation of a working fluid or coolant. They are fundamentally better at heat conduction over larger distances than heat sinks because their effective thermal conductivity is several orders of magnitude greater than that of the equivalent solid conductor.<ref>Electronics Cooling Methods in Industry; Heat Pipes in Electronics; http://www.pathways.cu.edu.eg/ec/Text-PDF/Part%20C-15.pdf</ref>\n\nWhen it is desirable to maintain junction temperatures below 125\u2013150&nbsp;\u00b0C, copper/water heat pipes are typically used.

An important design aspect of heat exchanger technology is the selection of appropriate materials to conduct and transfer heat fast and efficiently.\n\nCopper has many desirable properties for thermally efficient and durable [[heat exchangers]]. First and foremost, copper is an excellent conductor of heat. This means that copper's high [[thermal conductivity]] allows heat to pass through it quickly. Other desirable properties of '''copper in heat exchangers''' include its [[corrosion]] resistance, [[biofouling]] resistance, maximum allowable stress and internal pressure, creep rupture strength, [[fatigue strength]], [[hardness]], [[thermal expansion]], [[specific heat]], [[antimicrobial]] properties, [[tensile strength]], [[yield strength]], high [[melting point]], [[alloy]]ability, ease of fabrication, and ease of joining.\n\nThe combination of these properties enable copper to be specified for heat exchangers in industrial facilities, HVAC systems, vehicular coolers and radiators, and as [[heat sink]]s to cool computers, [[disk drive]]s, televisions, computer monitors, and other electronic equipment.<ref>{{cite web|website= Copper properties and uses|publisher =Schoolscience.co.uk|url = http://resources.schoolscience.co.uk/cda/14-16/chemistry/copch0pg4.html|title = Introduction}}</ref> Copper is also incorporated into the bottoms of high-quality [[Cookware and bakeware#Cookware materials#Copper|cookware]] because the metal conducts heat quickly and distributes it evenly.\n\nNon-copper heat exchangers are also available. Some alternative materials include aluminium, [[carbon steel]], [[stainless steel]], [[List of alloys|nickel alloys]], and [[titanium]].\n\nThis article focuses on beneficial properties and common applications of copper in heat exchangers.  New copper heat exchanger technologies for specific applications are also introduced.\n\n==History==\nHeat exchangers using copper and its alloys have evolved along with heat transfer technologies over the past several hundred years. Copper condenser tubes were first used in 1769 for [[steam engine]]s. Initially, the tubes were made of unalloyed copper. By 1870, [[Muntz metal]], a 60% Cu-40% Zn [[brass]] alloy, was used for condensers in seawater cooling. Admiralty metal, a 70% Cu-30% Zn yellow brass alloy with 1% [[tin]] added to improve corrosion resistance, was introduced in 1890 for seawater service.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Gaffoglio, Carl J., Copper alloy surface condenser tube application and service considerations; CDA Heat Exchange Seminars; Copper Development Association</ref> By the 1920s, a 70% Cu-30% Ni alloy was developed for naval condensers. Soon afterwards, a 2% [[manganese]] and 2% iron copper alloy was introduced for better erosion resistance. A 90% Cu-10% Ni alloy first became available in the 1950s, initially for seawater piping. This alloy is now the most widely used copper-nickel alloy in marine heat exchangers.\n\nToday, steam, evaporator, and condenser coils are made from copper and copper alloys.<ref name=\"srcoils.com\">{{cite web|title = Coils |publisher = Super Radiator Coils |url =https://www.superradiatorcoils.com/userAssets/Coil-Product-Brochure-4th-Edition-DEC-2017_Web.pdf }}</ref> These heat exchangers are used in [[air conditioning]] and [[refrigeration]] systems, industrial and central heating and cooling systems, [[radiator]]s, [[hot water tank]]s, and under-floor heating systems.\n\nCopper-based heat exchangers can be manufactured with copper tube/aluminium fin, cupro-nickel, or all-copper constructions. Various coatings can be applied to enhance corrosion resistance of the tubes and fins.<ref name=\"srcoils.com\"/><ref>10 tips on getting the most from your coil; Super Radiator Coils; http://www.srcoils.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2010/05/T003-10-Tips.pdf{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Beneficial properties of copper heat exchangers==\n\n===Thermal conductivity===\nThermal conductivity (k, also denoted as \u03bb or \u03ba) is a measure of a material's ability to conduct [[heat conduction|heat]]. Heat transfer across materials of high thermal conductivity occurs at a higher rate than across materials of low thermal conductivity. In the [[International System of Units]] (SI), thermal conductivity is measured in watts per meter Kelvin (W/(m\u2022K)). In the Imperial System of Measurement (British Imperial, or [[Imperial units]]), thermal conductivity is measured in Btu/(hr\u2022ft\u22c5F).\n\nCopper has a thermal conductivity of 231 Btu/(hr-ft-F). This is higher than all other metals except silver, a [[precious metal]]. Copper has a 60% better thermal conductivity rating than aluminium and a 3,000% better rating than stainless steel.<ref>{{cite journal |title =Materials for thermal conduction |year=2001|last= Chung|first= DDL|journal = Applied Thermal Engineering|volume = 21|pages= 1593\u20131605|url = http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~ddlchung/Materials%20for%20thermal%20conduction.pdf|doi=10.1016/s1359-4311(01)00042-4}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\nThermal conductivity of some common metals<ref>{{cite web|title =Thermal Properties of Metals, Conductivity, Thermal Expansion, Specific Heat|website= Engineer's Edge |url = http://www.engineersedge.com/properties_of_metals.htm}}</ref>\n\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Metal\t\t\t\n! colspan=\"2\" | Thermal conductivity\n|-\n!

However, the thermal conductivity of stainless steel is 1/30th that of copper. Aluminium tubes are not suitable for potable or untreated water applications because it corrodes at pH<7.0 and releases hydrogen gas.<ref name=\"brazetek.com\">Finned coil heat exchangers (water to air heat exchangers); Brazetek; http://www.brazetek.com/water-to-air-heat-exchangers</ref><ref>T.E.

For certain applications, the film is composed of iron. In power plant condensers, duplex tubes consisting of an inner titanium layer with outer copper-nickel alloys are employed. This enables the use of copper\u2019s beneficial mechanical and chemical properties (e.g., stress corrosion cracking, ammonia attack) along with titanium\u2019s excellent corrosion resistance. A duplex tube with inner aluminium brass or copper-nickel and outer stainless or mild steel can be used for cooling in the oil refining and petrochemical industries.<ref name=\"shinkometal.co.jp\">Kobelco: Copper alloy tubes for heat-exchanger; Shinko Metal Products, Japan; http://www.shinkometal.co.jp/catalog/copperalloy-en-sc.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029202052/http://www.shinkometal.co.jp/catalog/copperalloy-en-sc.pdf |date=29 October 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===Biofouling resistance===\nCopper and copper-nickel alloys have a high natural resistance to biofouling relative to alternative materials. Other metals used in heat exchangers, such as steel, titanium and aluminium, foul readily. Protection against biofouling, particularly in marine structures, can be accomplished over long periods of time with copper metals.\n\nCopper-nickel alloys have been proven over many years in sea water pipework and other marine applications. These alloys resist biofouling in open seas where they do not allow microbial slime to build up and support macrofouling.<ref>Powell, C.A.; Preventing biofouling with copper-nickel; Copper Development Association, October 2002; {{cite web |url=http://www.copperinfo.co.uk/alloys/copper-nickel/downloads/pub-157-preventing-biofouling-with-copper-nickel.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=26 November 2012 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030065725/http://www.copperinfo.co.uk/alloys/copper-nickel/downloads/pub-157-preventing-biofouling-with-copper-nickel.pdf |archivedate=30 October 2012 |df= }}</ref>\n\nResearchers attribute copper's resistance to biofouling, even in temperate waters, to two possible mechanisms: 1) a retarding sequence of colonization through slow release of copper ions during the corrosion process, thereby inhibiting the attachment of microbial layers to marine surfaces;<ref>Sutherland, I.W., 1983, Microbial exopolysaccarides: Their role in microbial adhesion in aqueous systems, Critical Reviews in Microbiology, Vol. 10, pp.173\u2013201</ref> and/or, 2) separating layers that contain corrosive products and the larvae of macro-encrusting organisms.<ref name=\"autogenerated1995\">Edding, Mario E., Flores, Hector, and Miranda, Claudio, (1995), Experimental Usage of Copper-Nickel Alloy Mesh in Mariculture.

Hence, the surfaces of copper-based heat exchangers are cleaner for longer periods of time than heat exchangers made from other metals. This benefit offers a greatly expanded heat exchanger service life and contributes to improved air quality.\nHeat exchangers fabricated separately from antimicrobial copper and aluminium in a full-scale HVAC system have been evaluated for their ability to limit microbial growth under conditions of normal flow rates using single-pass outside air. Commonly used aluminium components developed stable biofilms of bacteria and fungi within four weeks of operation. During the same time period, antimicrobial copper was able to limit bacterial loads associated with the copper heat exchanger fins by 99.99% and fungal loads by 99.74%.<ref>Michels, H. (2011).

While copper tube is used in most air conditioning and refrigeration systems, typical air conditioning units currently use aluminium fins. These systems can harbor bacteria and mold and develop odors and fouling that can make them function poorly.<ref>Antimicrobial Copper; http://www.antimicrobialcopper.com {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017003446/http://www.antimicrobialcopper.com/ |date=17 October 2012 }}</ref> Stringent new requirements including demands for increased operating efficiencies and the reduction or elimination of harmful emissions are enhancing copper's role in modern [[HVAC]] systems.<ref>Applications: Air Conditioning and Refrigeration; Copper Development Association; http://www.copper.org/applications/plumbing/apps/acr.html</ref>\n\nCopper\u2019s antimicrobial properties can enhance the performance of HVAC systems and associated [[indoor air quality]]. After extensive testing, copper became a registered material in the U.S. for protecting heating and air conditioning equipment surfaces against bacteria, [[mold]], and [[mildew]]. Furthermore, testing funded by the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] is demonstrating that all-copper air conditioners suppress the growth of bacteria, mold and mildew that cause odors and reduce system energy efficiency. Units made with aluminium have not been demonstrating this benefit.<ref>US EPA registers antimicrobial copper for HVAC applications; Antimicrobial Copper; http://www.antimicrobialcopper.com/us/news-center/news/us-epa-registers-antimicrobial-copper-for-hvac-applications.aspx</ref><ref>Buildings.com; Copper for HVAC Efficiency; http://www.buildings.com/tabid/3334/ArticleID/11545/Default.aspx</ref>\n\nCopper can cause a galvanic reaction in the presence of other alloys, leading to corrosion.<ref>[http://www.gewater.com/handbook/cooling_water_systems/ch_24_corrosion.jsp Corrosion Control-Cooling Systems | GE Water]</ref>\n\n===Gas water heaters===\nWater heating is the second largest energy use in the home. Gas-water heat exchangers that transfer heat from gaseous fuels to water between 3 and 300 kilowatts thermal (kWth) have widespread residential and commercial use in water heating and heating boiler appliance applications.\n\nDemand is increasing for energy-efficient compact water heating systems. Tankless gas water heaters produce hot water when needed. Copper heat exchangers are the preferred material in these units because of their high thermal conductivity and ease of fabrication. To protect these units in [[acid]]ic environments, durable coatings or other surface treatments are available. Acid-resistant coatings are capable of withstanding temperatures of 1000&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>Gas water heaters with improved heat exchangers; http://copperalliance.org/core-initiatives/technology/technology-projects/</ref><ref>Gas Combustion Equipment; http://copperalliance.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2012/06/technology_roadmap-en.pdf{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Forced air heating and cooling===\nAir-source heat pumps have been used for residential and commercial heating and cooling for many years. These units rely on air-to-air heat exchange through evaporator units similar to those used for air conditioners. Finned water to air heat exchangers are most commonly used for forced air heating and cooling systems, such as with indoor and outdoor wood furnaces, boilers, and stoves. They can also be suitable for liquid cooling applications. Copper is specified in supply and return manifolds and in tube coils.<ref name=\"brazetek.com\"/>\n\n===Direct Exchange (DX) Geothermal Heating/Cooling===\n[[Geothermal]] heat pump technology, variously known as \"ground source,\" \"earth-coupled,\" or \"direct exchange,\" relies on circulating a refrigerant through buried copper tubing for heat exchange. These units, which are considerably more efficient than their air-source counterparts, rely on the constancy of ground temperatures below the [[frost]] zone for heat transfer.\nThe most efficient ground source heat pumps use ACR, Type L or special-size copper tubing buried into the ground to transfer heat to or from the conditioned space. Flexible copper tube (typically 1/4-inch to 5/8-inch) can be buried in deep vertical holes, horizontally in a relatively shallow grid pattern, in a vertical fence-like arrangement in medium-depth trenches, or as custom configurations. Further information is available.<ref>Copper DX geothermal heat pump; Copper Development Association; http://www.copper.org/applications/plumbing/heatpump/dxhp_main.html</ref>\n\n===Electronic systems===\nCopper and aluminium are used as [[heat sinks]] and [[heat pipes]] in [[electronics|electronic]] cooling applications. A [[heat sink]] is a passive component that cools [[semiconductor]] and [[optoelectronic]] devices by dissipating heat into the surrounding air. Heat sinks have temperatures higher than their surrounding environments so that heat can be transferred into the air by [[convection]], [[radiation]], and [[conduction (heat)|conduction]].\n\nAluminium is the most prominently used heat sink material because of its lower cost.<ref>Thermal Solutions Intl., Copper heatsinks; http://www.thermal-solutions.us/copper-heatsinks.html</ref> Copper heat sinks are a necessity when higher levels of thermal conductivity are needed. An alternative to all-copper or all-aluminium heat sinks is the joining of aluminium fins to a copper base.<ref>Cooliance; Copper heat sinks; {{cite web |url=http://www.cooliance.com/resources/copper-heatsinks.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=10 February 2015 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011082149/http://www.cooliance.com/resources/copper-heatsinks.html |archivedate=11 October 2014 |df= }}</ref>\n\nCopper heat sinks are die-cast and bound together in plates. They spread heat quickly from the heat source to copper or aluminium fins and into the surrounding air.\n\nHeat pipes are used to move heat away from [[central processing units]] (CPUs) and [[graphics processing units]] (GPUs) and towards heat sinks, where thermal energy is dissipated into the environment. Copper and aluminium heat pipes are used extensively in modern computer systems where increased power requirements and associated heat emissions result in greater demands on cooling systems.\n\nA heat pipe typically consists of a sealed pipe or tube at both the hot and cold ends. Heat pipes utilize [[evaporative cooling]] to transfer thermal energy from one point to another by the evaporation and condensation of a working fluid or coolant. They are fundamentally better at heat conduction over larger distances than heat sinks because their effective thermal conductivity is several orders of magnitude greater than that of the equivalent solid conductor.<ref>Electronics Cooling Methods in Industry; Heat Pipes in Electronics; http://www.pathways.cu.edu.eg/ec/Text-PDF/Part%20C-15.pdf</ref>\n\nWhen it is desirable to maintain junction temperatures below 125\u2013150&nbsp;\u00b0C, copper/water heat pipes are typically used. Copper/[[methanol]] heat pipes are used if the application requires heat pipe operations below 0&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>Electronics cooling: Heat pipes for electronics cooling applications; 1 September 1996; http://www.electronics-cooling.com/1996/09/heat-pipes-for-electronics-cooling-applications</ref>\n\n==New technologies==\n\n===CuproBraze===\n{{Advert|section|date=May 2015}}\n{{Main| CuproBraze}}\n[[CuproBraze]] is a copper-alloy heat exchanger technology developed for applications that need to withstand harsh conditions.

He progressed through the Liverpool youth team and scored on his debut in May 1997. In his first full season in the [[Premier League]], he finished as joint top scorer with 18 goals. He repeated this the following year and was Liverpool's top goal-scorer from 1997\u20132004, gaining his name as a proven goal-scorer despite suffering from a recurring [[hamstring]] injury. In [[2000\u201301 Liverpool F.C. season|2001]], Liverpool won a cup [[Treble (association football)|treble]] of the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]], [[FA Cup]] and [[Football League Cup]], and Owen was the recipient of the [[2001 Ballon d'Or|Ballon d'Or]]. He went on to score 118 goals in 216 appearances in the Premier League for Liverpool, and 158 goals in 297 total appearances. Regarded as one of the greatest Liverpool players, Owen came 14th in the \"100 Players Who Shook The Kop\", an official Liverpool fan poll.<ref>[http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/have-you-seen/100pwstk-14-michael-owen \"100PWSTK: 14.

After a promising start to the 2005\u201306 season, injuries largely ruled him out over the next 18 months. After his return, he became team [[Captain (association football)|captain]] and was the team's top scorer for the [[2007\u201308 Newcastle United F.C. season|2007\u201308 season]]. Newcastle were relegated in the [[2008\u201309 Newcastle United F.C. season|2008\u201309 season]] and Owen moved to Manchester United as a [[free agent]]. He spent three years at [[Old Trafford]] before joining Stoke City in September 2012.

His performance at the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] brought him to national and international prominence and he went on to score in [[UEFA Euro 2000]], the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]]. He is the only player to have scored in four consecutive major tournaments for England. He played at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]], but suffered an injury which took him a year to recover from.

Another useful plan is to educate the public by letting them know when a dengue outbreak is occurring and what they can do to protect themselves.

Physical health and mental health have a reciprocal relationship.<ref name=berry/> If the physical health of an individual is negatively impacted, the decline in mental health will soon follow.<ref name=berry/> These impacts are more gradual and cumulative. They are threats to emotional wellbeing through concern and uncertainty about future risks.<ref name=\"clayton\"/> They are also large-scale community and social effects, like conflicts related to [[Human migration|migration]] and subsequent shortages or adjustment after a disaster. Extreme weather events play a major role here; their impacts can be indirect, not just direct.<ref name=berry/> This is due to the effect on physical health from extreme weather events. Each extreme weather event affects humans in different ways, but they all lead to the decline of mental health.<ref name=berry/>\n[[Heat]] indirectly causes mental health issues through physical health issues. The World Health Organization presents the fact that high extreme heat is directly related to certain ailments like [[cardiovascular disease]], [[respiratory disease]], and [[asthma]]. One piece of their evidence is that in summer 2003, during Europe's big heat wave, there were 70,000 recorded deaths related to the heat.<ref name=worldhealth/> Heat exhaustion also occurs during extreme heat. As climate change continues, heat will continue to rise and these problems will exacerbate. These physical problems lead to mental health problems. As physical health worsens and is less curable, mental stability starts to deteriorate.<ref name=berry/>\n\nAs extreme heat makes landscapes dry, nature is more prone to fire. Research shows that rising heat due to climate change has caused an increase in fires around the United States.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Westerling|first1=Anthony|title=Increasing western US forest wildfire activity: sensitivity to changes in the timing of spring|url=http://ulmo.ucmerced.edu/pdffiles/16RSTB_Westerling.pdf|publisher=University of California}}</ref> [[Burn]]s and smoke inhalation from the increasing number of fires lead to a decline in physical health, which leads to mental health problems.

More than one hundred farmers in the Australian countryside had committed suicide by 2007.<ref name=epstein/> An individual's suicide often leads to mental health problems of loved ones. They face issues like those who have lost loved ones due to fire: grief, sadness, anger, [[paranoia]], and others.<ref name=bowlby/>\n\nSome impacts pertaining to mental health are even more gradual and cumulative than the others, like [[Social relation|social interaction]], [[media (communication)|media]], and [[communication]].<ref name=clayton/> The social interaction between communities and within communities is greatly affected by migration. Communities choose to migrate, or are forced to migrate, due to stressors on limited resources. This is worsened by extreme weather events caused by climate change.<ref name=portier/> Common mental health conditions associated indirectly from these extreme weather events include [[Acute stress reaction|acute traumatic stress]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[complicated grief]], [[anxiety disorders]], sleep difficulties, and [[sexual dysfunction]]. [[Substance abuse|Drug abuse]] and [[Alcoholism|alcohol abuse]] are also common aftereffects, and can lead to both physical and mental issues, [[addiction]] and substance reliance being the most common.<ref name=portier/>\n\nThe effects of [[Hurricane Katrina]], a past extreme weather event in [[New Orleans]], lead to a variety of mental health problems due to the destruction of resources<ref name=epstein/> Many people impacted by Hurricane Katrina were left [[homeless]], disenfranchised, stressed, and suffering physical illness. This strain on the [[public health]] system decreased access and availability of medical resources.<ref name=epstein/> Some [[climate change adaptation]] measures may prevent the need for displacement. However, some communities may be unable to implement adaptation strategies, and this will create added stress, further exacerbating already existing mental health issues.<ref name=portier/>  Extreme weather events and population displacement lead to limited availability of [[medications]], one of the primary resources required to meet psychological and physical needs of those affected by such events. Less medication and medical resources means fewer people can get the help they need to recover. Slowed recovery and lack of recovery worsen overall mental health.<ref name=portier/>\n\n====Psychological impacts====\nPsychological impacts are the effects that heat, [[drought]], migrations, and climate-related conflicts have on social life and community life. This includes post-disaster adjustment.<ref name=clayton/> Most of these effects are indirect instead of direct, but Clayton and Berry place them in a separate category because they deal with the relationships within a community.<ref name=berry/><ref name=clayton/> Many of the results are from how people use and occupy territory.<ref name=clayton/> Human migration of large communities causes discord within those communities because the already scarce resources are even more limited during migration.<ref name=portier/> Agriculture is severely impacted by the extreme weather events of climate change, the suitability of territory being the most notable kind of change.<ref name=clayton/> During and after migration, the geographical distribution of populations is altered.<ref name=clayton/> Children and parents may be separated at these times. The early separation of children from their parents can cause symptoms of grieving, depression, and detachment in both the young and old.<ref name=bowlby/> \n\nThe loss in resources can also lead to inter-community violence and aggression. Two groups may fight over remaining [[natural resources]]. A community may choose to migrate to find better resources, and encroach on another community's territory, either accidentally or purposefully.<ref name=clayton/> Civil unrest can occur when [[governments]] fail to adequately protect communities against the extreme weather events that cause these effects.

In areas where the amount of water in rivers and streams depends on snow melting, warmer temperatures increase the fraction of precipitation falling as rain rather than as snow, causing the annual spring peak in water runoff to occur earlier in the year. This can lead to an increased likelihood of winter [[flood]]ing and reduced late summer river flows. Rising sea levels cause saltwater to enter into fresh [[underground water]] and freshwater streams. This reduces the amount of freshwater available for drinking and farming.

Although the change in our climate is causing us to lose food, these sources are also contributing to climate change, essentially, creating a [[feedback loop]]. [[Greenhouse gases]], specifically from livestock, are one of the leading sources furthering global warming; these emissions, which drastically effect climatic change, are also beginning to harm our livestock in ways we could never imagine.\n\n===Greenhouse gas effects===\nOur agricultural food system is responsible for a significant amount of the greenhouse-gas emissions that are produced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.feu-us.org/images/The_Food_Gap.pdf |title=The Food Gap: The Impacts of Climate Change on Food Production: a 2020 Perspective |date=2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416214231/http://www.feu-us.org/images/The_Food_Gap.pdf |archivedate=16 April 2012 |df= }}</ref><ref name=strategies>{{Cite journal |first1=Sharon |last1=Friel |first2=Alan D. |last2=Dangour |first3=Tara |last3=Garnett |first4=Karen |last4=Lock |first5=Zaid |last5=Chalabi |first6=Ian |last6=Roberts |first7=Ainslie |last7=Butler |first8=Colin D. |last8=Butler |first9=Jeff |last9=Waage |first10=Anthony J. |last10=McMichael |first11=Andy |last11=Haines |display-authors=3 |title=Public health benefits of strategies to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions: food and agriculture |journal=The Lancet |year=2009 |volume=374 |issue=9706 |pages=2016\u20132025 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61753-0|pmid=19942280 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[IPCC]], it makes up between, at least, 10-12% of the emissions, and when there are changes in land due to the agriculture, it can even rise as high as 17%.

Typically, beef and dairy, in other words, ruminant products, rank high in greenhouse-gas emissions; monogastric, or pigs and poultry-related foods, are low. The consumption of the monogastric types, therefore, yield less emissions.

This causes a decline in livestock productivity and can be detrimental to the farmers and consumers. Obviously, the location and species of the livestock varies and therefore the effects of heat vary between them. This is noted in livestock at a higher elevation and in the [[tropics]], of which have a generally increased effect from climate change. Livestock in a higher elevation are very vulnerable to high heat and are not well adapted to those changes.\n\n==Impact on plant based food==\n[[Climate change]] has many potential impacts on the production of food crops\u2014from [[food scarcity]] and nutrient deficiency to possible increased food production because of elevated [[CO2 emissions|carbon dioxide ({{CO2}})]] levels\u2014all of which directly affect [[human health]].

Without this protection, beetles are able to eat the soybean leaves freely, resulting in a lower crop yield.<ref name=\"Ferber & Epstein\"/> This is not a problem unique to soybeans, and many plant species\u2019 defense mechanisms are impaired in a high {{CO2}} environment.<ref name=Chakra/>\n\nCurrently, pathogens take 10-16% of the global harvest and this level is likely to rise as plants are at an ever-increasing risk of exposure to pests and pathogens.<ref name=Chakra/> Historically, cold temperatures at night and in the winter months would kill off [[insects]], [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]]. The warmer, wetter winters are promoting fungal plant diseases like [[soybean rust]] to travel northward. Soybean rust is a vicious plant pathogen that can kill off entire fields in a matter of days, devastating farmers and costing billions in agricultural losses. Another example is the [[Mountain Pine Beetle]] epidemic in [[BC, Canada]] which killed millions of pine trees because the winters were not cold enough to slow or kill the growing beetle larvae.<ref name=\"Ferber & Epstein\"/> The increasing incidence of flooding and heavy rains also promotes the growth of various other plant pests and diseases.<ref name=Rod11>{{cite journal |last=Rodenburg |first=J. |last2=Meinke |first2=H. |last3=Johnson |first3=D.

Oceans work as a sink absorbing excess [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}). As the oceans absorb [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}) it breaks down into [[carbonic acid]], a mild acid, this neutralizes the normally [[alkaline]] ocean water. As a result, the pH in the oceans is declining. In the research surrounding global climate change we are only just beginning to realize that our oceans can sequester a finite amount of {{CO2}} before we start seeing impacts on marine life that could lead to devastating losses. Acidification of our oceans has the potential to drastically alter life as we know it - from [[extreme weather]] patterns and [[food scarcity]] to a loss of millions of species from the planet - all of these consequences hold the potential to directly affect [[human health]].\n\n===Coral===\nWith degradation of protective coral reefs through acidic erosion, bleaching and death, salt water is able to infiltrate fresh ground water supplies that large populations depend on.<ref name=\"atoll\">{{cite journal|last=Terry|first=James|last2=Chui|first2=Ting Fong May|date=May 2012|title=Evaluating the fate of freshwater lenses on atoll islands after eustatic sea-level rise and cyclone driven inundation: A modelling approach|journal=[[Global and Planetary Change]]|volume=88\u201389|pages=76\u201384|bibcode=2012GPC....88...76T|doi=10.1016/j.gloplacha.2012.03.008}}</ref><ref name=\"child\">{{cite journal|last=Khan|first=Aneire Ehmar|last2=Ireson|first2=Andrew|last3=Kovats|first3=Sari|last4=Mojumder|first4=Sontosh Kumar|last5=Khusru|first5=Amirul|last6=Rahman|first6=Atiq|last7=Vineis|first7=Paolo|display-authors=3|date=September 2011|title=Drinking Water Salinity and Maternal Health in Coastal Bangladesh: Implications of Climate Change|journal=[[Environmental Health Perspectives]]|volume=119|issue=9|pages=1328\u20131332|doi=10.1289/ehp.1002804|pmc=3230389|pmid=21486720}}</ref> Nowhere is this more evident than atoll islands.

With seafood being a major protein source for so much of the population, there are inherent health risks associated with global warming. As mentioned above increased agricultural runoff and warmer water temperature allows for eutrophication of ocean waters. This increased growth of algae and phytoplankton in turn can have dire consequences. These algal blooms can emit toxic substances that can be harmful to humans if consumed. Organisms, such as shellfish, marine crustaceans and even fish, feed on or near these infected blooms, ingest the toxins and can be consumed unknowingly by humans. One of these toxin producing algae is Pseudo-nitzschia fraudulenta. This species produces a substance called [[domoic acid]] which is responsible for [[amnesic shellfish poisoning]].<ref name=pseudo>{{cite journal |last=Tatters |first=Avery O. |first2=Fei-Xue |last2=Fu |first3=David A. |last3=Hutchins |title=High {{CO2}} and Silicate Limitation Synergistically Increase the Toxicity of ''Pseudo-nitzschia fraudulenta'' |journal=[[PLOS ONE]] |date=February 2012 |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=e32116 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0032116 |pmid=22363805 |pmc=3283721 |bibcode=2012PLoSO...732116T}}</ref>  The toxicity of this species has been shown to increase with greater {{CO2}} concentrations associated with ocean acidification.<ref name=pseudo/>  Some of the more common illnesses reported from harmful algal blooms include; [[Ciguatera fish poisoning]], [[paralytic shellfish poisoning]], azaspiracid shellfish poisoning, [[diarrhetic shellfish poisoning]], [[neurotoxic shellfish poisoning]] and the above-mentioned amnesic shellfish poisoning.<ref name=pseudo/>\n\n==Extreme weather events==\nInfectious disease often accompanies [[extreme weather]] events, such as floods, earthquakes and drought. These local epidemics occur due to loss of infrastructure, such as hospitals and sanitation services, but also because of changes in local ecology and environment. For example, malaria outbreaks have been strongly associated with the El Ni\u00f1o cycles of a number of countries (India and Venezuela, for example). [[El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation|El Ni\u00f1o]] can lead to drastic, though temporary, changes in the environment such as temperature fluctuations and [[flash flood]]s.<ref name=Epstein/> Because of global warming there has been a marked trend towards more variable and anomalous weather. This has led to an increase in the number and severity of extreme weather events. This trend towards more variability and fluctuation is perhaps more important, in terms of its impact on human health, than that of a gradual and long-term trend towards higher average temperature.<ref name=Epstein/>\n\n===Drought===\nArguably one of the worst effects that drought has directly on human health is the destruction of food supply. Farmers who depend on weather to water their crops lose tons of crops per year due to drought. Plant growth is severely stunted without adequate water, and plant resistance mechanisms to fungi and insects weaken like human immune systems. The expression of genes is altered by increased temperatures, which can also affect a plant's resistance mechanisms. One example is wheat, which has the ability to express genes that make it resistant to leaf and stem rusts, and to the Hessian fly; its resistance declines with increasing temperatures.\nA number of other factors associated with lack of water may actually attract pestilent insects, as well- some studies have shown that many insects are attracted to yellow hues, including the yellowing leaves of drought-stressed plants.\nDuring times of mild drought is when conditions are most suitable to insect infestation in crops; once the plants become too weakened, they lack the nutrients necessary to keep the insects healthy. This means that even a relatively short, mild drought may cause enormous damage- even though the drought on its own may not be enough to kill a significant portion of the crops, once the plants become weakened, they are at higher risk of becoming infested.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mattson |first1=William J. |last2=Haack |first2=Robert A. |title=Role of Drought in Outbreaks of Plant-Eating Insects |journal=[[BioScience]] |date=February 1987 |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=110\u2013118 |url=http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1054&context=barkbeetles |doi=10.2307/1310365|jstor=1310365 }}</ref>\n\nThe results of the loss of crop yields affect everyone, but they can be felt most by the poorest people in the world. As supplies of corn, flour and vegetables decline, world food prices are driven up. Malnutrition rates in poor areas of the world skyrocket, and with this, dozens of associated diseases and health problems. Immune function decreases, so mortality rates due to infectious and other diseases climb. For those whose incomes were affected by droughts (namely agriculturalists and pastoralists), and for those who can barely afford the increased food prices, the cost to see a doctor or visit a clinic can simply be out of reach. Without treatment, some of these diseases can hinder one's ability to work, decreasing future opportunities for income and perpetuating the vicious cycle of poverty.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Christian |first=Parul |title=Impact of the Economic Crisis and Increase in Food Prices on Child Mortality: Exploring Nutritional Pathways |journal=[[Journal of Nutrition]] |date=January 2010 |volume=140 |issue=1 |pages=177S\u2013181S |pmc=2793127 |pmid=19923384 |doi=10.3945/jn.109.111708}}</ref>\n\n===Floods===\n[[Health]] concerns around the world can be linked to [[floods]].

The Countries with lower [[incomes]] are more likely to have more [[Death|fatalities]], because of the lack of [[resources]] they have and the supplies to prepare for a flood. This does depend on the type and properties of the flood. For example, if there is a [[flash flood]] it would not matter how prepared you are. Fatalities connected directly to floods are usually caused by [[drowning]]; the waters in a flood are very deep and have strong [[current (fluid)|currents]].<ref name=alderman/>  [[Deaths]] do not just occur from drowning, deaths are connected with [[dehydration]], [[heat stroke]], [[heart attack]] and any other [[illness]] that needs [[medical supplies]] that cannot be delivered.<ref name=alderman/> Due to flooding mud, grit or sand particles can be deposited into the lakes and rivers. These particles cause the water to become dirty and this becomes a problem as the dirty water leads to water related diseases. For example, cholera and guinea worm disease are caused by dirty water.<ref>thewaterproject.org brighter futures begins with clean water</ref>\n\nInjuries can lead to an excessive amount of morbidity when a flood occurs. Victims who already have a [[chronic illness]] and then sustain a non-fatal injury are put at a higher risk for that non-fatal injury to become [[Death|fatal]]. Injuries are not isolated to just those who were directly in the flood, [[rescue]] teams and even people delivering supplies can sustain an injury. Injuries can occur anytime during the flood process; before, during and after.<ref name=alderman/>  Before the flood people are trying to [[emergency evacuation|evacuate]] as fast as they can, [[motor vehicle accidents]], in this case, are a primary source of injuries obtained post flood. During floods accidents occur with falling [[debris]] or any of the many fast moving objects in the water. After the flood rescue attempts are where large numbers injuries can occur.<ref name=alderman/>\n\n[[Communicable diseases]] are increased due to many [[pathogens]] and [[bacteria]] that are being transported by the [[water]]. In floods where there are many fatalities in the water there is a [[hygienic]] problem with the handling of bodies, due to the [[panic]] stricken mode that comes over a town in distress.<ref name=alderman/>  There are many water [[contaminated]] diseases such as [[cholera]], [[hepatitis A]], [[hepatitis E]] and [[diarrheal diseases]], to mention a few. There are certain diseases that are directly correlated with floods they include any [[dermatitis]] and any [[wound]], [[nose]], [[throat]] or [[ear infection]]. [[Gastrointestinal disease]] and diarrheal diseases are very common due to a lack of clean water during a flood. Most of clean water supplies are contaminated when flooding occurs. Hepatitis A and E are common because of the lack of [[sanitation]] in the water and in living quarters depending on where the flood is and how prepared the [[community]] is for a flood.<ref name=alderman/>\n\n[[Respiratory diseases]] are a common after the disaster has occurred. This depends on the amount of [[water damage]] and [[Mold (fungus)|mold]] that grows after an incident. [[Vector (epidemiology)|Vector]] borne diseases increase as well due to the increase in still water after the floods have settled. The diseases that are vector borne are  [[malaria]], [[dengue]], [[West Nile virus|West Nile]], and [[yellow fever]].<ref name=alderman/>\n\nNon-communicable diseases are a long-term effect of floods. They are either caused by a flood or they are worsened by a flood; they include [[cancer]], [[lung disease]] and [[diabetes]]. Floods have a huge impact on victims' psychosocial [[integrity]]. People suffer from a wide variety of losses and [[stress (psychological)|stress]].

One improvement would be having a better system of detecting when dengue outbreaks may happen. This can be done by monitoring environments, such as temperatures, rainfall and humidity that would be attractive to these types of mosquitoes and help them to flourish. Another useful plan is to educate the public by letting them know when a dengue outbreak is occurring and what they can do to protect themselves. For example, people should create a living environment that is not attractive to mosquitoes (no standing water), dress in appropriate clothing (light colours, long sleeves), and wear insect repellent. \n\n\"Some 1.8 billion (more than 70%) of the population at risk for dengue worldwide live in member states of the WHO South-East Asia Region and Western Pacific Region, which bear nearly 75% of the current global disease burden due to dengue.

Physical health and mental health have a reciprocal relationship.<ref name=berry/> If the physical health of an individual is negatively impacted, the decline in mental health will soon follow.<ref name=berry/> These impacts are more gradual and cumulative. They are threats to emotional wellbeing through concern and uncertainty about future risks.<ref name=\"clayton\"/> They are also large-scale community and social effects, like conflicts related to [[Human migration|migration]] and subsequent shortages or adjustment after a disaster. Extreme weather events play a major role here; their impacts can be indirect, not just direct.<ref name=berry/> This is due to the effect on physical health from extreme weather events. Each extreme weather event affects humans in different ways, but they all lead to the decline of mental health.<ref name=berry/>\n[[Heat]] indirectly causes mental health issues through physical health issues. The World Health Organization presents the fact that high extreme heat is directly related to certain ailments like [[cardiovascular disease]], [[respiratory disease]], and [[asthma]]. One piece of their evidence is that in summer 2003, during Europe's big heat wave, there were 70,000 recorded deaths related to the heat.<ref name=worldhealth/> Heat exhaustion also occurs during extreme heat. As climate change continues, heat will continue to rise and these problems will exacerbate. These physical problems lead to mental health problems. As physical health worsens and is less curable, mental stability starts to deteriorate.<ref name=berry/>\n\nAs extreme heat makes landscapes dry, nature is more prone to fire. Research shows that rising heat due to climate change has caused an increase in fires around the United States.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Westerling|first1=Anthony|title=Increasing western US forest wildfire activity: sensitivity to changes in the timing of spring|url=http://ulmo.ucmerced.edu/pdffiles/16RSTB_Westerling.pdf|publisher=University of California}}</ref> [[Burn]]s and smoke inhalation from the increasing number of fires lead to a decline in physical health, which leads to mental health problems. Deaths of family and friends cause individuals to suffer from stress and other conditions. Many suffering from loss of family and friends will internalize their emotions, feel extreme guilt and helplessness, and become paranoid. Others will develop fear of future loss and have an overall displacement of feelings that could last for years.<ref name=bowlby>{{Cite journal|last1=Lorna|first1=Bowlby-West|title=The impact of death on the family system|journal=Journal of Family Therapy|volume=5|issue=3|pages=279\u2013294|doi=10.1046/j..1983.00623.x|year=1983}}</ref> Anderson published research in the American Psychological Association that shows the increase in murders in the United States directly correlates with the temperature increase.

Studies show that suicide rates increase after extreme weather events. This is evidence for the decline in mental health.<ref name=epstein>{{cite book |last1=Epstein |first1=Paul R. |last2=Ferber |first2=Dan |title=Changing Planet, Changing Health: How the Climate Crisis Threatens Our Health and what We Can Do about it |url=https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_c1j4 |url-access=registration |year=2011 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-26909-5}}{{page needed|date=August 2016}}</ref> The increased suicide risk has been demonstrated in [[Australia]], where [[drought]] has resulted in [[crop]] failures and despair to the Australian countryside. After the event, farmers were left with almost nothing. They were forced to sell their belongings, reduce their stock, and borrow large sums of money to plant crops at the start of the next season.<ref name=epstein/> These consequences have caused a growing increase in [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[domestic violence]], and suicide. More than one hundred farmers in the Australian countryside had committed suicide by 2007.<ref name=epstein/> An individual's suicide often leads to mental health problems of loved ones. They face issues like those who have lost loved ones due to fire: grief, sadness, anger, [[paranoia]], and others.<ref name=bowlby/>\n\nSome impacts pertaining to mental health are even more gradual and cumulative than the others, like [[Social relation|social interaction]], [[media (communication)|media]], and [[communication]].<ref name=clayton/> The social interaction between communities and within communities is greatly affected by migration. Communities choose to migrate, or are forced to migrate, due to stressors on limited resources. This is worsened by extreme weather events caused by climate change.<ref name=portier/> Common mental health conditions associated indirectly from these extreme weather events include [[Acute stress reaction|acute traumatic stress]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[complicated grief]], [[anxiety disorders]], sleep difficulties, and [[sexual dysfunction]]. [[Substance abuse|Drug abuse]] and [[Alcoholism|alcohol abuse]] are also common aftereffects, and can lead to both physical and mental issues, [[addiction]] and substance reliance being the most common.<ref name=portier/>\n\nThe effects of [[Hurricane Katrina]], a past extreme weather event in [[New Orleans]], lead to a variety of mental health problems due to the destruction of resources<ref name=epstein/> Many people impacted by Hurricane Katrina were left [[homeless]], disenfranchised, stressed, and suffering physical illness. This strain on the [[public health]] system decreased access and availability of medical resources.<ref name=epstein/> Some [[climate change adaptation]] measures may prevent the need for displacement. However, some communities may be unable to implement adaptation strategies, and this will create added stress, further exacerbating already existing mental health issues.<ref name=portier/>  Extreme weather events and population displacement lead to limited availability of [[medications]], one of the primary resources required to meet psychological and physical needs of those affected by such events. Less medication and medical resources means fewer people can get the help they need to recover. Slowed recovery and lack of recovery worsen overall mental health.<ref name=portier/>\n\n====Psychological impacts====\nPsychological impacts are the effects that heat, [[drought]], migrations, and climate-related conflicts have on social life and community life. This includes post-disaster adjustment.<ref name=clayton/> Most of these effects are indirect instead of direct, but Clayton and Berry place them in a separate category because they deal with the relationships within a community.<ref name=berry/><ref name=clayton/> Many of the results are from how people use and occupy territory.<ref name=clayton/> Human migration of large communities causes discord within those communities because the already scarce resources are even more limited during migration.<ref name=portier/> Agriculture is severely impacted by the extreme weather events of climate change, the suitability of territory being the most notable kind of change.<ref name=clayton/> During and after migration, the geographical distribution of populations is altered.<ref name=clayton/> Children and parents may be separated at these times. The early separation of children from their parents can cause symptoms of grieving, depression, and detachment in both the young and old.<ref name=bowlby/> \n\nThe loss in resources can also lead to inter-community violence and aggression. Two groups may fight over remaining [[natural resources]]. A community may choose to migrate to find better resources, and encroach on another community's territory, either accidentally or purposefully.<ref name=clayton/> Civil unrest can occur when [[governments]] fail to adequately protect communities against the extreme weather events that cause these effects. When this happens, individuals lose confidence and trust in their government. A loss in trust can be the beginning of oncoming mental health problems.<ref name=bowlby/><ref>{{cite report |last=Abbott |first=Chris |title=An Uncertain Future: Law Enforcement, National Security and Climate Change |publisher=Oxford Research Group |date=January 2008 |url=http://www.oxfordresearchgroup.org.uk/sites/default/files/uncertainfuture.pdf}}</ref> The disruption of a community when they are forced to relocate results in the deterioration of geographic and social connections.

Some kinds of blue-green algae create neurotoxins, hepatoxins, cytotoxins or endotoxins that can cause serious and sometimes fatal neurological, liver and digestive diseases in humans. Cyanobacteria grow best in warmer temperatures (especially above 25 degrees Celsius), and so areas of the world that are experiencing general warming as a result of climate change are also experiencing harmful algal blooms more frequently and for longer periods of time. During times of intense precipitation (such as during the \u201cwet season\u201d in much of the tropical and sub-tropical world, including Australia and Panama), nutrients that cyanobacteria depend on are carried from groundwater and the earth's surface into bodies of water.

[[Freshwater]] resources are highly sensitive to variations in weather and climate. Climate change is projected to affect water availability.  In areas where the amount of water in rivers and streams depends on snow melting, warmer temperatures increase the fraction of precipitation falling as rain rather than as snow, causing the annual spring peak in water runoff to occur earlier in the year. This can lead to an increased likelihood of winter [[flood]]ing and reduced late summer river flows. Rising sea levels cause saltwater to enter into fresh [[underground water]] and freshwater streams. This reduces the amount of freshwater available for drinking and farming. Warmer water temperatures also affect water quality and accelerate [[water pollution]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Kathleen |last=Miller |title=Climate Change Impacts on Water |work=Climate Change and Water Research |publisher=Institute for the Study of Society and Environment (ISSE) at the National Center for Atmospheric Research |access-date=12 August 2016 |url=http://www.isse.ucar.edu/water_climate/impacts.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031172136/http://www.isse.ucar.edu/water_climate/impacts.html |archive-date=31 October 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Impact on livestock==\nClimate change is beginning to lead the global population into a food shortage, greatly affecting our [[livestock]] supply. Although the change in our climate is causing us to lose food, these sources are also contributing to climate change, essentially, creating a [[feedback loop]]. [[Greenhouse gases]], specifically from livestock, are one of the leading sources furthering global warming; these emissions, which drastically effect climatic change, are also beginning to harm our livestock in ways we could never imagine.\n\n===Greenhouse gas effects===\nOur agricultural food system is responsible for a significant amount of the greenhouse-gas emissions that are produced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.feu-us.org/images/The_Food_Gap.pdf |title=The Food Gap: The Impacts of Climate Change on Food Production: a 2020 Perspective |date=2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416214231/http://www.feu-us.org/images/The_Food_Gap.pdf |archivedate=16 April 2012 |df= }}</ref><ref name=strategies>{{Cite journal |first1=Sharon |last1=Friel |first2=Alan D. |last2=Dangour |first3=Tara |last3=Garnett |first4=Karen |last4=Lock |first5=Zaid |last5=Chalabi |first6=Ian |last6=Roberts |first7=Ainslie |last7=Butler |first8=Colin D. |last8=Butler |first9=Jeff |last9=Waage |first10=Anthony J. |last10=McMichael |first11=Andy |last11=Haines |display-authors=3 |title=Public health benefits of strategies to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions: food and agriculture |journal=The Lancet |year=2009 |volume=374 |issue=9706 |pages=2016\u20132025 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61753-0|pmid=19942280 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[IPCC]], it makes up between, at least, 10-12% of the emissions, and when there are changes in land due to the agriculture, it can even rise as high as 17%.

Typically, beef and dairy, in other words, ruminant products, rank high in greenhouse-gas emissions; monogastric, or pigs and poultry-related foods, are low. The consumption of the monogastric types, therefore, yield less emissions.

Cattle require a temperature range of 5-15 degrees Celsius, but upwards to 25&nbsp;\u00b0C, to live comfortably, and once climate change increases the temperature, the chance of these changes occurring increases.<ref name=\"impact\" /> Once the high temperatures hit, the livestock struggle to keep up their metabolism, resulting in decreased food intake, lowered activity rate, and a drop in weight. This causes a decline in livestock productivity and can be detrimental to the farmers and consumers. Obviously, the location and species of the livestock varies and therefore the effects of heat vary between them. This is noted in livestock at a higher elevation and in the [[tropics]], of which have a generally increased effect from climate change. Livestock in a higher elevation are very vulnerable to high heat and are not well adapted to those changes.\n\n==Impact on plant based food==\n[[Climate change]] has many potential impacts on the production of food crops\u2014from [[food scarcity]] and nutrient deficiency to possible increased food production because of elevated [[CO2 emissions|carbon dioxide ({{CO2}})]] levels\u2014all of which directly affect [[human health]].

On the opposite end of the spectrum, droughts can also wipe out crops. It is estimated that 35-50% of the world's crops are at risk of drought.<ref name=\"Ferber & Epstein\"/> [[Drought in Australia|Australia]] has been experiencing severe, recurrent droughts for a number of years, bringing serious despair to its farmers. The country's rates of [[depression (mood)|depression]] and [[domestic violence]] are increasing and as of 2007, more than one hundred farmers had committed suicide as their thirsty crops slipped away.<ref name=\"Ferber & Epstein\"/> Drought is even more disastrous in the [[developing world]], exacerbating the pre-existing [[poverty]] and fostering [[famine]] and [[malnutrition]].<ref name=Hertel/><ref name=\"Ferber & Epstein\"/>\n\nDroughts can cause farmers to rely more heavily on [[irrigation]]; this has downsides for both the individual farmers and the consumers. The equipment is expensive to install and some farmers may not have the financial ability to purchase it.<ref name=Connor/> The water itself must come from somewhere and if the area has been in a drought for any length of time, the rivers may be dry and the water must be transported from further distances. With 70% of \u201cblue water\u201d currently being used for global agriculture, any need over and above this could potentiate a [[water crisis]].<ref name=Hertel/><ref name=Beddington/>  In [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], water is used to flood [[rice fields]] to control the weed population; with the projection of less precipitation for this area, this historical method of weed control will no longer be possible.<ref name=Rod10>{{cite journal |last=Rodenburg |first=Jonne |last2=Riches |first2=Charles R. |last3=Kayeke |first3=Juma M. |title=Addressing current and future problems of parasitic weeds in rice |journal=Crop Protection |year=2010 |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=210\u2013221 |doi=10.1016/j.cropro.2009.10.015}}</ref>\n\nWith more costs to the farmer, some will no longer find it financially feasible to farm. [[Agriculture]] employs the majority of the population in most low-income countries and increased costs can result in worker layoffs or pay cuts.<ref name=Hertel/> Other farmers will respond by raising their food prices; a cost which is directly passed on to the consumer and impacts the affordability of food. Some farms do not export their goods and their function is to feed a direct family or community; without that food, people will not have enough to eat. This results in decreased production, increased food prices, and potential starvation in parts of the world.<ref name=Beddington/>\n\n===Financial===\nSome research suggests that initially climate change will help developing nations because some regions will be experiencing more negative climate change effects which will result in increased demand for food leading to higher prices and increased wages.<ref name=Hertel/> However, many of the projected [[climate change scenario|climate scenarios]] suggest a huge financial burden. For example, the [[2003 European heat wave|heat wave that passed through Europe in 2003]] cost 13 billion euros in uninsured agriculture losses.<ref name=\"Tubiello & Soussana\"/> In addition, during [[El Nino]] weather conditions, the chance of the Australian farmer's income falling below average increased by 75%, greatly impacting the country's [[GDP]].<ref name=\"Tubiello & Soussana\"/> The agriculture industry in [[India]] makes up 52% of their employment and the [[Canadian Prairies]] supply 51% of Canadian agriculture; any changes in the production of food crops from these areas could have profound effects on the [[economy]].<ref name=Kul/><ref name=Sindhu/> This could negatively affect the affordability of food and the subsequent health of the population.\n\n===Pests and pathogens===\nCurrently, {{CO2}} levels are 40% higher than they were in [[pre-industrial agriculture|pre-industrial]] times.<ref name=\"Ferber & Epstein\"/> This diminishes nutritional content for both human and insect consumption. Studies have shown that when {{CO2}} levels rise, [[soybean]] leaves are less nutritious; therefore plant-eating beetles have to eat more to get their required [[nutrients]].<ref name=\"Ferber & Epstein\"/> In addition, soybeans are less capable of defending themselves against the predatory insects under high {{CO2}}. The {{CO2}} diminishes the plant's [[jasmonic acid]] production, an insect-killing poison that is excreted when the plant senses it's being attacked. Without this protection, beetles are able to eat the soybean leaves freely, resulting in a lower crop yield.<ref name=\"Ferber & Epstein\"/> This is not a problem unique to soybeans, and many plant species\u2019 defense mechanisms are impaired in a high {{CO2}} environment.<ref name=Chakra/>\n\nCurrently, pathogens take 10-16% of the global harvest and this level is likely to rise as plants are at an ever-increasing risk of exposure to pests and pathogens.<ref name=Chakra/> Historically, cold temperatures at night and in the winter months would kill off [[insects]], [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]]. The warmer, wetter winters are promoting fungal plant diseases like [[soybean rust]] to travel northward. Soybean rust is a vicious plant pathogen that can kill off entire fields in a matter of days, devastating farmers and costing billions in agricultural losses. Another example is the [[Mountain Pine Beetle]] epidemic in [[BC, Canada]] which killed millions of pine trees because the winters were not cold enough to slow or kill the growing beetle larvae.<ref name=\"Ferber & Epstein\"/> The increasing incidence of flooding and heavy rains also promotes the growth of various other plant pests and diseases.<ref name=Rod11>{{cite journal |last=Rodenburg |first=J. |last2=Meinke |first2=H. |last3=Johnson |first3=D.

Studies show that increasing atmospheric levels of {{CO2}} have an unfavourable effect on the nutrients in plants. As the [[carbon]] concentration in the plant's tissues increase, there is a corresponding decrease in the concentration of [[Chemical element|elements]] such as [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[zinc]] and [[iodine]].

Oceans work as a sink absorbing excess [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}). As the oceans absorb [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}) it breaks down into [[carbonic acid]], a mild acid, this neutralizes the normally [[alkaline]] ocean water. As a result, the pH in the oceans is declining. In the research surrounding global climate change we are only just beginning to realize that our oceans can sequester a finite amount of {{CO2}} before we start seeing impacts on marine life that could lead to devastating losses. Acidification of our oceans has the potential to drastically alter life as we know it - from [[extreme weather]] patterns and [[food scarcity]] to a loss of millions of species from the planet - all of these consequences hold the potential to directly affect [[human health]].\n\n===Coral===\nWith degradation of protective coral reefs through acidic erosion, bleaching and death, salt water is able to infiltrate fresh ground water supplies that large populations depend on.<ref name=\"atoll\">{{cite journal|last=Terry|first=James|last2=Chui|first2=Ting Fong May|date=May 2012|title=Evaluating the fate of freshwater lenses on atoll islands after eustatic sea-level rise and cyclone driven inundation: A modelling approach|journal=[[Global and Planetary Change]]|volume=88\u201389|pages=76\u201384|bibcode=2012GPC....88...76T|doi=10.1016/j.gloplacha.2012.03.008}}</ref><ref name=\"child\">{{cite journal|last=Khan|first=Aneire Ehmar|last2=Ireson|first2=Andrew|last3=Kovats|first3=Sari|last4=Mojumder|first4=Sontosh Kumar|last5=Khusru|first5=Amirul|last6=Rahman|first6=Atiq|last7=Vineis|first7=Paolo|display-authors=3|date=September 2011|title=Drinking Water Salinity and Maternal Health in Coastal Bangladesh: Implications of Climate Change|journal=[[Environmental Health Perspectives]]|volume=119|issue=9|pages=1328\u20131332|doi=10.1289/ehp.1002804|pmc=3230389|pmid=21486720}}</ref> Nowhere is this more evident than atoll islands.

With seafood being a major protein source for so much of the population, there are inherent health risks associated with global warming. As mentioned above increased agricultural runoff and warmer water temperature allows for eutrophication of ocean waters. This increased growth of algae and phytoplankton in turn can have dire consequences. These algal blooms can emit toxic substances that can be harmful to humans if consumed.

These local epidemics occur due to loss of infrastructure, such as hospitals and sanitation services, but also because of changes in local ecology and environment. For example, malaria outbreaks have been strongly associated with the El Ni\u00f1o cycles of a number of countries (India and Venezuela, for example). [[El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation|El Ni\u00f1o]] can lead to drastic, though temporary, changes in the environment such as temperature fluctuations and [[flash flood]]s.<ref name=Epstein/> Because of global warming there has been a marked trend towards more variable and anomalous weather. This has led to an increase in the number and severity of extreme weather events. This trend towards more variability and fluctuation is perhaps more important, in terms of its impact on human health, than that of a gradual and long-term trend towards higher average temperature.<ref name=Epstein/>\n\n===Drought===\nArguably one of the worst effects that drought has directly on human health is the destruction of food supply. Farmers who depend on weather to water their crops lose tons of crops per year due to drought. Plant growth is severely stunted without adequate water, and plant resistance mechanisms to fungi and insects weaken like human immune systems. The expression of genes is altered by increased temperatures, which can also affect a plant's resistance mechanisms. One example is wheat, which has the ability to express genes that make it resistant to leaf and stem rusts, and to the Hessian fly; its resistance declines with increasing temperatures.\nA number of other factors associated with lack of water may actually attract pestilent insects, as well- some studies have shown that many insects are attracted to yellow hues, including the yellowing leaves of drought-stressed plants.\nDuring times of mild drought is when conditions are most suitable to insect infestation in crops; once the plants become too weakened, they lack the nutrients necessary to keep the insects healthy. This means that even a relatively short, mild drought may cause enormous damage- even though the drought on its own may not be enough to kill a significant portion of the crops, once the plants become weakened, they are at higher risk of becoming infested.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mattson |first1=William J. |last2=Haack |first2=Robert A. |title=Role of Drought in Outbreaks of Plant-Eating Insects |journal=[[BioScience]] |date=February 1987 |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=110\u2013118 |url=http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1054&context=barkbeetles |doi=10.2307/1310365|jstor=1310365 }}</ref>\n\nThe results of the loss of crop yields affect everyone, but they can be felt most by the poorest people in the world. As supplies of corn, flour and vegetables decline, world food prices are driven up. Malnutrition rates in poor areas of the world skyrocket, and with this, dozens of associated diseases and health problems. Immune function decreases, so mortality rates due to infectious and other diseases climb. For those whose incomes were affected by droughts (namely agriculturalists and pastoralists), and for those who can barely afford the increased food prices, the cost to see a doctor or visit a clinic can simply be out of reach. Without treatment, some of these diseases can hinder one's ability to work, decreasing future opportunities for income and perpetuating the vicious cycle of poverty.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Christian |first=Parul |title=Impact of the Economic Crisis and Increase in Food Prices on Child Mortality: Exploring Nutritional Pathways |journal=[[Journal of Nutrition]] |date=January 2010 |volume=140 |issue=1 |pages=177S\u2013181S |pmc=2793127 |pmid=19923384 |doi=10.3945/jn.109.111708}}</ref>\n\n===Floods===\n[[Health]] concerns around the world can be linked to [[floods]]. With the increase in temperatures worldwide due to climate change the increase in flooding is unavoidable.<ref>{{cite web |last=Vigran |first=Anna |title=With Climate Change Comes Floods |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=14 January 2008 |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18022014}}</ref>  [[Floods]] have short and long term negative implications to peoples' health and well being. Short term implications include [[Death|mortalities]], [[injuries]] and [[diseases]], while long term implications include [[non-communicable diseases]] and [[psychosocial]] health aspects.<ref name=alderman>{{cite journal |last=Alderman |first=Katarzyna |first2=Lyle R. |last2=Turner |first3=Shilu |last3=Tong |title=Floods and human health: A systematic review |journal=Environment International |date=June 2012 |volume=47 |pages=37\u201347 |doi=10.1016/j.envint.2012.06.003|pmid=22750033 |url=https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:346602/UQ346602_OA.pdf }}</ref>\n\nMortalities are not uncommon when it comes to floods. The Countries with lower [[incomes]] are more likely to have more [[Death|fatalities]], because of the lack of [[resources]] they have and the supplies to prepare for a flood. This does depend on the type and properties of the flood. For example, if there is a [[flash flood]] it would not matter how prepared you are. Fatalities connected directly to floods are usually caused by [[drowning]]; the waters in a flood are very deep and have strong [[current (fluid)|currents]].<ref name=alderman/>  [[Deaths]] do not just occur from drowning, deaths are connected with [[dehydration]], [[heat stroke]], [[heart attack]] and any other [[illness]] that needs [[medical supplies]] that cannot be delivered.<ref name=alderman/> Due to flooding mud, grit or sand particles can be deposited into the lakes and rivers. These particles cause the water to become dirty and this becomes a problem as the dirty water leads to water related diseases. For example, cholera and guinea worm disease are caused by dirty water.<ref>thewaterproject.org brighter futures begins with clean water</ref>\n\nInjuries can lead to an excessive amount of morbidity when a flood occurs. Victims who already have a [[chronic illness]] and then sustain a non-fatal injury are put at a higher risk for that non-fatal injury to become [[Death|fatal]]. Injuries are not isolated to just those who were directly in the flood, [[rescue]] teams and even people delivering supplies can sustain an injury. Injuries can occur anytime during the flood process; before, during and after.<ref name=alderman/>  Before the flood people are trying to [[emergency evacuation|evacuate]] as fast as they can, [[motor vehicle accidents]], in this case, are a primary source of injuries obtained post flood. During floods accidents occur with falling [[debris]] or any of the many fast moving objects in the water. After the flood rescue attempts are where large numbers injuries can occur.<ref name=alderman/>\n\n[[Communicable diseases]] are increased due to many [[pathogens]] and [[bacteria]] that are being transported by the [[water]]. In floods where there are many fatalities in the water there is a [[hygienic]] problem with the handling of bodies, due to the [[panic]] stricken mode that comes over a town in distress.<ref name=alderman/>  There are many water [[contaminated]] diseases such as [[cholera]], [[hepatitis A]], [[hepatitis E]] and [[diarrheal diseases]], to mention a few. There are certain diseases that are directly correlated with floods they include any [[dermatitis]] and any [[wound]], [[nose]], [[throat]] or [[ear infection]]. [[Gastrointestinal disease]] and diarrheal diseases are very common due to a lack of clean water during a flood. Most of clean water supplies are contaminated when flooding occurs. Hepatitis A and E are common because of the lack of [[sanitation]] in the water and in living quarters depending on where the flood is and how prepared the [[community]] is for a flood.<ref name=alderman/>\n\n[[Respiratory diseases]] are a common after the disaster has occurred. This depends on the amount of [[water damage]] and [[mold]] that grows after an incident. [[Vector (epidemiology)|Vector]] borne diseases increase as well due to the increase in still water after the floods have settled. The diseases that are vector borne are  [[malaria]], [[dengue]], [[West Nile virus|West Nile]], and [[yellow fever]].<ref name=alderman/>\n\nNon-communicable diseases are a long-term effect of floods. They are either caused by a flood or they are worsened by a flood; they include [[cancer]], [[lung disease]] and [[diabetes]]. Floods have a huge impact on victims' psychosocial [[integrity]]. People suffer from a wide variety of losses and [[stress (psychological)|stress]]. One of the most treated illness in long-term health problems are [[depression (mood)|depression]] caused by the flood and all the [[tragedy]] that flows with one.<ref name=alderman/>\n\n=== Hurricanes ===\nAnother result of the warming oceans are stronger [[hurricanes]], which will wreak more havoc on land, and in the oceans,<ref name=\"Storms and Sickness\">{{cite book|title=Changing Planet, Changing Health: How the Climate Crisis Threatens Our Health and what We Can Do about it|last1=Epstein|first1=Paul R.|last2=Ferber|first2=Dan|publisher=University of California Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-520-26909-5|pp=[https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_c1j4/page/161 161\u2013178]|chapter=Storms and Sickness|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nnOkFhXo8rEC&pg=PA161|url=https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_c1j4/page/161}}</ref> and create more opportunities for vectors to breed and infectious diseases to flourish.<ref name=\"The Mosquito's Bite\" /><ref name=\"Sobering Predictions\" /> [[Extreme weather]] also means stronger winds.

Due to temperature changes and wind patterns, the pine beetle has now spread through the [[Continental Divide]] of the Rockies and has invaded the fragile [[boreal forest]]s of [[Alberta]], known as the \u201clungs of the Earth\u201d.<ref name=pinebeetle/> These forests are imperative for producing [[oxygen]] through [[photosynthesis]] and removing [[carbon]] in the [[atmosphere]]. But as the forests become infested and die, [[carbon dioxide]] is released into the environment, and contributes even more to a warming climate. Ecosystems and humans rely on the supply of oxygen in the environment, and threats to this boreal forest results in severe consequences to our planet and human health.<ref name=pinebeetle/> In a forest ravaged by pine beetle, the dead logs and kindle which can easily be ignited by [[lightning]].

Slow onset phenomena, including effects of climate change such as [[desertification]] and [[rising sea levels]] gradually erode livelihoods and force communities to abandon traditional homelands for more accommodating environments. This is currently happening in areas of Africa's [[Sahel]], the semi-arid belt that spans the continent just below its northern deserts.

According to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, more than 42 million people were displaced in Asia and the Pacific during 2010 and 2011, more than twice the population of Sri Lanka. This figure includes those displaced by storms, floods, and heat and cold waves. Still others were displaced drought and sea-level rise.

Though every effort should be made to ensure that people can stay where they live, it is also important to recognize that migration can also be a way for people to cope with environmental changes. If properly managed, and efforts made to protect the rights of migrants, migration can provide substantial benefits to both origin and destination areas, as well as to the migrants themselves.

Lake Forest offers 30 undergraduate major and minor programs in the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences, and features programs of study in pre-law, pre-medicine, communication, business, finance, and computer science.<ref name=\"facstud\"/> The majority of students live on the college's wooded 107-acre campus located a half-mile from the [[Lake Michigan]] shore.\n\nLake Forest is affiliated with the [[Associated Colleges of the Midwest]]. The college has 19 varsity teams which compete in the [[NCAA Division III]] [[Midwest Conference]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Young Hall.jpg|thumb|left|Young Hall, the tallest building in the city of Lake Forest, houses most of the humanities departments on campus]]\n\nLake Forest College was founded in 1857 by Reverend Robert W. Patterson as a Presbyterian alternative to the Methodist [[Northwestern University]] in [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]]. It was originally named '''Lind University''' after Sylvester Lind, who had given $80,000 to launch the school.<ref name=\"history\"/> Patterson and his fellow Chicago Presbyterians established the town of Lake Forest and the university roughly halfway between Evanston and [[Waukegan, Illinois|Waukegan]] two years after the [[Chicago and Milwaukee Railway]] began service from Chicago. They hired St. Louis landscape architect Almerin Hotchkiss to design the town of Lake Forest with a university park at its center. Hotchkiss used the area's wooded ravines and forest as guidelines to plat a park-like, curvilinear layout for the town.\n\n[[Lake Forest Academy]], a boys' preparatory school and the first project of the university, began offering classes in 1858; collegiate-level courses began in 1860. By the mid-1860s, a small [[New England]]-style village had been established with an academy building, a Presbyterian church and several homes. The school had a medical college from 1859\u20131863, which later split off and eventually became part of Northwestern University, now known as the Northwestern University [[Feinberg School of Medicine]].\n\nIn 1865, the name became '''Lake Forest University'''. In 1869 [[Ferry Hall]], a girls' preparatory school and junior college, opened as a division of the university.<ref name=ea>{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Lake Forest University}}</ref> It later merged with Lake Forest Academy in 1974.\n\nIn 1876 Mary Eveline Smith Farwell started Lake Forest College, a coeducational division of the university, under the leadership of the Reverend Patterson. In 1878, College Hall (now Young Hall) was built following a fire that destroyed the former hotel being used for classes.\n\nThe Reverend James Gore King McClure arrived in Lake Forest in 1881 as the pastor of the Presbyterian Church. Under his influence over the next 50 years, the college experienced a large transition \"from a pluralistic graduate and professional emphasis to a singular undergraduate liberal arts focus,\" says Lake Forest College archivist Art Miller, who co-wrote ''30 Miles North: A History of Lake Forest College, Its Town, and Its City of Chicago''.<ref>{{ISBN|978-0-9638189-6-6}}</ref> During this time, the college's theater group, the Garrick Players, the yearbook, and student newspaper, ''The Stentor'', were all formed.\n\nIn 1890 Lake Forest established a relationship with the [[Chicago Dental Infirmary|Chicago College of Dental Surgery]], Chicago's first dental school, to serve as its dental department. This affiliation ended in 1902.\n\nThe Lake Forest School of Music opened as a division of the university in 1916, incorporating and extending the courses in music hitherto given in other departments. A summer school of landscape architecture was instituted in 1916.<ref name=ea/>\n\nBy 1925, Lake Forest College split from Lake Forest Academy, and the school's only focus was on undergraduate liberal arts. Following [[World War II]], the college experienced further growth, taking control of what is now South Campus and constructing the Alumni Memorial Fieldhouse.\n\nIn 1960, William Graham Cole, from [[Williams College]], took over as president and brought with him Eastern faculty and students, further diversifying the campus. During his time as president, in 1965, the school's name was officially changed to Lake Forest College.<ref name=\"history\"/> In March 2010, the college received $7 million from alumna [[Grace Groner]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nation-and-world/la-na-millionaire-donation6-2010mar06,0,2910138.story |title=A hidden millionaire's college gift |publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=2010-03-06 |accessdate=2012-01-28}}</ref>\n\n==Faculty==\nThe teaching faculty consists of 178 members.

Founded in 1857 as '''Lind University''' by a group of Presbyterian ministers, the college has been coeducational since 1876 and an undergraduate-focused liberal arts institution since 1903.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lakeforest.edu/about/history |title=History of the College|publisher=Lake Forest College |accessdate= 14 February 2015}}</ref> Lake Forest enrolls approximately 1,600 students representing 47 states and 81 countries. Lake Forest offers 30 undergraduate major and minor programs in the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences, and features programs of study in pre-law, pre-medicine, communication, business, finance, and computer science.<ref name=\"facstud\"/> The majority of students live on the college's wooded 107-acre campus located a half-mile from the [[Lake Michigan]] shore.\n\nLake Forest is affiliated with the [[Associated Colleges of the Midwest]]. The college has 19 varsity teams which compete in the [[NCAA Division III]] [[Midwest Conference]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Young Hall.jpg|thumb|left|Young Hall, the tallest building in the city of Lake Forest, houses most of the humanities departments on campus]]\n\nLake Forest College was founded in 1857 by Reverend Robert W. Patterson as a Presbyterian alternative to the Methodist [[Northwestern University]] in [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]]. It was originally named '''Lind University''' after Sylvester Lind, who had given $80,000 to launch the school.<ref name=\"history\"/> Patterson and his fellow Chicago Presbyterians established the town of Lake Forest and the university roughly halfway between Evanston and [[Waukegan, Illinois|Waukegan]] two years after the [[Chicago and Milwaukee Railway]] began service from Chicago. They hired St. Louis landscape architect Almerin Hotchkiss to design the town of Lake Forest with a university park at its center. Hotchkiss used the area's wooded ravines and forest as guidelines to plat a park-like, curvilinear layout for the town.\n\n[[Lake Forest Academy]], a boys' preparatory school and the first project of the university, began offering classes in 1858; collegiate-level courses began in 1860. By the mid-1860s, a small [[New England]]-style village had been established with an academy building, a Presbyterian church and several homes. The school had a medical college from 1859\u20131863, which later split off and eventually became part of Northwestern University, now known as the Northwestern University [[Feinberg School of Medicine]].\n\nIn 1865, the name became '''Lake Forest University'''. In 1869 [[Ferry Hall]], a girls' preparatory school and junior college, opened as a division of the university.<ref name=ea>{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Lake Forest University}}</ref> It later merged with Lake Forest Academy in 1974.\n\nIn 1876 Mary Eveline Smith Farwell started Lake Forest College, a coeducational division of the university, under the leadership of the Reverend Patterson. In 1878, College Hall (now Young Hall) was built following a fire that destroyed the former hotel being used for classes.\n\nThe Reverend James Gore King McClure arrived in Lake Forest in 1881 as the pastor of the Presbyterian Church. Under his influence over the next 50 years, the college experienced a large transition \"from a pluralistic graduate and professional emphasis to a singular undergraduate liberal arts focus,\" says Lake Forest College archivist Art Miller, who co-wrote ''30 Miles North: A History of Lake Forest College, Its Town, and Its City of Chicago''.<ref>{{ISBN|978-0-9638189-6-6}}</ref> During this time, the college's theater group, the Garrick Players, the yearbook, and student newspaper, ''The Stentor'', were all formed.\n\nIn 1890 Lake Forest established a relationship with the [[Chicago Dental Infirmary|Chicago College of Dental Surgery]], Chicago's first dental school, to serve as its dental department. This affiliation ended in 1902.\n\nThe Lake Forest School of Music opened as a division of the university in 1916, incorporating and extending the courses in music hitherto given in other departments. A summer school of landscape architecture was instituted in 1916.<ref name=ea/>\n\nBy 1925, Lake Forest College split from Lake Forest Academy, and the school's only focus was on undergraduate liberal arts. Following [[World War II]], the college experienced further growth, taking control of what is now South Campus and constructing the Alumni Memorial Fieldhouse.\n\nIn 1960, William Graham Cole, from [[Williams College]], took over as president and brought with him Eastern faculty and students, further diversifying the campus. During his time as president, in 1965, the school's name was officially changed to Lake Forest College.<ref name=\"history\"/> In March 2010, the college received $7 million from alumna [[Grace Groner]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nation-and-world/la-na-millionaire-donation6-2010mar06,0,2910138.story |title=A hidden millionaire's college gift |publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=2010-03-06 |accessdate=2012-01-28}}</ref>\n\n==Faculty==\nThe teaching faculty consists of 178 members.

The lighter brown cones are from the current season; the darker brown cones are mature cones from previous seasons.]]\nTamaracks are very cold tolerant, able to survive temperatures down to at least {{convert|-65|C|F|0}}, and commonly occurs at the [[Arctic]] [[tree line]] at the edge of the [[tundra]]. Trees in these severe climatic conditions are smaller than farther south, often only {{convert|5|m|ft|round=5|abbr=on}} tall. They can tolerate a wide range of soil conditions but grow most commonly in [[swamp]]s, [[bog]]s, or [[muskeg]] in wet to moist organic soils such as [[sphagnum]] [[peat]] and woody peat. They are also found on mineral soils that range from heavy clay to coarse sand; thus texture does not seem to be limiting. Although tamarack can grow well on [[calcareous]] soils, it is not abundant on the [[limestone]] areas of eastern [[Ontario]].\n\n[[File:2015-08-20 17 12 36 Tamarack seedling in a sphagnum bog adjacent to Taborton Road (Rensselaer County Route 42) in Sand Lake, New York.jpg|thumb|upright|Tamarack sapling in a sphagnum bog]]\nTamarack is commonly an early invader.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=44751 |title=Black Spruce |first=C.

In the lake states, tamarack may appear first in the [[sedge mat]], sphagnum moss, or not until the bog shrub stage. Farther north, it is the pioneer tree in the bog shrub stage. Tamarack is fairly well adapted to reproduce successfully on burns, so it is one of the common [[pioneer species|pioneers]] on sites in the boreal forest immediately after a fire.\n\nThe central [[Alaska]]n population, separated from the eastern [[Yukon]] populations by a gap of about {{convert|700|km|mi}}, is treated as a distinct variety ''Larix laricina'' var. ''alaskensis'' by some botanists, though others argue that it is not sufficiently distinct to be distinguished.\n\n== Associated forest cover ==\n[[File:Tamarack.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Young tree with fall colors]]\nTamarack forms extensive pure stands in the [[Boreal ecosystem|boreal]] region of [[Canada]] and in northern [[Minnesota]]. In the rest of its [[United States]] range and in the [[Maritime Provinces]], tamarack is found locally in both pure and mixed stands. It is a major component in the [[Society of American Foresters]] (SAF) [[forest cover type]]s Tamarack and [[black spruce\u2013tamarack]].\n\n[[Black spruce]] (''Picea mariana'') is usually tamarack's main associate in mixed stands on all sites. The other most common associates include [[balsam fir]] (''Abies balsamea''), [[white spruce]] (''Picea glauca''), and [[quaking aspen]] (''Populus tremuloides'') in the boreal region. In the better organic soil sites in the northern forest region, the most common associates are the [[northern white-cedar]] (''Thuja occidentalis''), balsam fir, [[Fraxinus nigra|black ash]] (''Fraxinus nigra''), and [[red maple]] (''Acer rubrum''). In [[Alaska]], quaking aspen and tamarack are almost never found together. Additional common associates are [[American elm]] (''Ulmus americana''), [[balsam poplar]] (''Populus balsamifera''), [[jack pine]] (''Pinus banksiana''), [[paper birch]] (''Betula papyrifera''), [[Kenai birch]] (''B. papyrifera'' var. ''kenaica''), and [[yellow birch]] (''B. alleghaniensis'').\n\nTamarack stands cast light shade and so usually have a dense undergrowth of shrubs and herbs. Because the tree has an extensive range, a great variety of shrubs is associated with it. Dominant tall shrubs include [[American dwarf birch|dwarf]] and [[swamp birch]] (''Betula glandulosa'' and ''Betula pumila''), [[willow]]s (''Salix'' spp.), [[speckled alder]] (''Alnus rugosa''), and [[red-osier dogwood]] (''Cornus stolonifera''). Low shrubs include [[bog Labrador tea]] (''Ledum groenlandicum''), [[bog-rosemary]] (''Andromeda glaucophylla''), [[leather leaf]] (''Chamaedaphne calyculata''), and [[small cranberry]] (''Vaccinium oxycoccos''). Characteristically the herbaceous cover includes [[Carex|sedges]] ''(Carex'' spp.), [[cottongrass]] ''(Eriophorum'' spp.), [[three-leaved false Solomonseal]] (''Maianthemum trifolium''), [[marsh cinquefoil]] (''Potentilla palustris''), [[Caltha palustris|marsh-marigold]] (''Caltha palustris''), and [[bogbean]] (''Menyanthes trifoliata''). Ground cover is usually composed of [[sphagnum moss]] ''([[Sphagnum]]'' spp.) and other mosses.\n\n== Seed cones and pollen cones ==\nTamarack is [[monoecious]]. Male and female cones are small, either solitary or in groups of 2 or 3, and appear with the needles. Male cones are yellow and are borne mainly on 1- or 2-year-old [[branchlet]]s. Female cones resemble tiny roses. They are reddish or maroon, have needles at their base which are shorter and bluer than the other needles on the tree. They are borne most commonly on 2 to 4-year-old branchlets, but may also appear on branchlets 5 or more years old. Cones usually are produced on young growth of vigorous trees. On open-grown trees, cones are borne on all parts of the crown. Mature seed cones are brown, oblong-ovoid, and {{convert|13|to|19|mm|in|frac=16|abbr=on}} long.\n\n== Uses ==\n[[File:Larix laricina bonsai by Nick Lenz.jpg|thumb|upright|''Larix laricina'' bonsai]]\nThe [[wood]] is tough and durable, but also flexible in thin strips, and was used by the [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] people for making [[snowshoe]]s and other products where toughness was required. The natural crooks located in the stumps and roots are also preferred for creating [[Knee (construction)|knees]] in wooden boats. Currently, the wood is used principally for [[pulpwood]], but also for posts, poles, rough lumber, and fuelwood; it is not a major commercial timber species.it is also used in horse stables to resist abrasion and kicking damage. <ref name=FEIS>{{FEIS |genus=Larix |species=laricina |type=tree |last=Uchytil |first=Ronald J. |year=1991}}</ref>\n\nIt is also grown as an [[ornamental tree]] in gardens in cold regions.

Tamarack trees were used before 1917 in [[Alberta]] to mark the northeast corner of sections surveyed within townships. They were used by the surveyors because at that time the very rot-resistant wood was readily available in the bush and was light to carry.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Their rot resistance was also why they were often used in early water distribution systems.\n\nThe aboriginal peoples of Canada's northwest regions used the inner bark as a poultice to treat cuts, infected wounds, [[frostbite]], boils and hemorrhoids. The outer bark and roots are also said to have been used with another plant as a treatment for [[arthritis]], cold and general aches and pains.<ref>{{cite book |title=Aboriginal Plant Use in Canada's Northwest Boreal Forest |first=Robin James |last=Marles |publisher=Canadian Forest Service |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-660-19869-9 |page=<!--missing-->}}</ref>\n\nWildlife use the tree for food and nesting. Porcupines eat the inner bark, snowshoe hares feeds on tamarack seedlings, and red squirrels eat the seeds.<ref>{{Silvics |volume=1 |genus=Larix |species=laricina |first=William F. |last=Johnston |accessdate=2015-12-04}}</ref> Birds that frequent tamaracks during the summer include the white-throated sparrow, song sparrow, veery, common yellow throat, and Nashville warbler.<ref>Dawson, Deanna K. 1979.

North Central Forest Experiment Station, St. Paul, MN.</ref>\n\n== Reaction to competition ==\nTamarack is very intolerant of shade. Although it can tolerate some shade during the first several years, it must become dominant to survive. When mixed with other species, it must be in the over story. The tree is a good self-pruner, and boles of 25- to 30-year-old trees may be clear for one-half or two-thirds their length.\n\nBecause tamarack is very shade-intolerant, it does not become established in its own shade. Consequently, the more tolerant black spruce eventually succeeds tamarack on poor bog sites, whereas northern white-cedar, balsam fir, and swamp hardwoods succeed tamarack on good swamp sites. Recurring [[sawfly]] outbreaks throughout the range of tamarack have probably speeded the usual succession to black spruce or other associates.\n\nVarious tests on planting and natural reproduction indicate that competing vegetation hinders tamarack establishment.\n\nThe shade-intolerance of tamarack dictates the use of even-aged management. Some adaptation of clear cutting or seed-tree cutting is generally considered the best [[silvicultural]] system because tamarack seeds apparently germinate better in the open, and the seedlings require practically full light to survive and grow well. Tamarack is also usually wind-firm enough for the seed-tree system to succeed. Satisfactory reestablishment of tamarack, however, often requires some kind of site preparation, such as slash disposal and [[herbicide]] spraying.\n\n== Damaging agents ==\nThe tamarack has thin bark and is therefore highly susceptible to fire damage, except perhaps in older, upland stands. However, the habitat of tamarack, especially south of the [[Boreal ecosystem|boreal]] forest, is normally wet enough to protect the tree from fire. The tamarack is also susceptible to high winds. Strong winds can uproot large tamarack trees growing in swamps or other wet-land sites where rooting is shallow. It has also been discovered that abnormally high water levels often kill tamarack stands. Those that survive under such conditions usually grow very slowly. Other effects of high water include dieback and the development of adventitious roots and shoots. Wetland road crossings and beaver damming are the primary causes of flooding.\n\nMany insect species are known to be destructive to tamaracks. The non-indigenous [[larch sawfly]] is the most destructive. Epidemics occur periodically across [[Canada]] and the northern [[United States]] and have caused tremendous losses of merchantable tamarack throughout most of the tree's range. Indications are that radial increment declines markedly after 4 to 6 years of outbreak. After 6 to 9 years of moderate to heavy defoliation, the trees die. In southeastern [[Manitoba]] and northern [[Minnesota]], however, imported parasites of the sawfly have become established and should reduce the frequency and duration of future outbreaks. Another serious defoliator is the [[larch casebearer]] ''[[Coleophora laricella]]''. The [[larch casebearer]] attacks tamarack of all ages, and several severe outbreaks have caused extensive mortality in some areas. Outbreak severity has lessened in recent years, however, probably due to imported parasites of the casebearer that have become widely established.\n\nOnly a few other insects and related organisms (such as [[mites]]) that feed on tamarack are known to sometimes cause serious injury. During an outbreak, the [[spruce budworm]] (''[[Choristoneura fumiferana]]'') can severely damage tamarack. The [[larch-bud moth]] (''[[Zeiraphera improbana]]'') has had occasional short epidemics, and the [[spruce spider mite]] (''[[Oligonychus ununguis]]'') is occasionally found in large numbers on tamarack. The [[Argyresthia laricella|larch-shoot moth]] ''([[Argyresthia laricella]])'' is widely distributed, but serious injury is unusual. One of the most common bark beetles attacking tamarack is the [[eastern larch beetle]] (''[[Dendroctonus simplex]]''), but it feeds mainly on weakened, dying, or dead trees.\n\nTamarack is a host to many pathogens, but only one cause diseases serious enough to have an economic impact on its culture, the ''[[Lachnellula willkommii]]'' fungus. It is a relatively new pathogen in Canada, first recorded in 1980 and originating in Europe. The fungus cause large [[canker]]s to form and a disease known as [[Larch#Diseases|larch canker]] which is particularly harmful to the tamarack larch, killing both young and mature trees.<ref>[http://www.exoticpests.gc.ca/es-details/disease/1000096 European larch canker] Natural Resources Canada</ref> Apart from this, the only common foliage diseases are rusts, such as the leaf rust in eastern and central North America. However, this rust, caused by the fungus ''[[Melampsora medusae]]'', and other rusts do little damage to tamarack. The [[needle-cast fungus]] ''[[Hypodermella laricis]]'' has attacked tamarack in [[Ontario]] and has the potential for local damage.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Larch ball]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n* ''This article incorporates text from the ''[https://srs.fs.usda.gov/pubs/misc/ag_654/volume_1/larix/laricina.htm Silvics of North America]'', freely licensed as a work of the US Fed.

The lighter brown cones are from the current season; the darker brown cones are mature cones from previous seasons.]]\nTamaracks are very cold tolerant, able to survive temperatures down to at least {{convert|-65|C|F|0}}, and commonly occurs at the [[Arctic]] [[tree line]] at the edge of the [[tundra]]. Trees in these severe climatic conditions are smaller than farther south, often only {{convert|5|m|ft|round=5|abbr=on}} tall. They can tolerate a wide range of soil conditions but grow most commonly in [[swamp]]s, [[bog]]s, or [[muskeg]] in wet to moist organic soils such as [[sphagnum]] [[peat]] and woody peat. They are also found on mineral soils that range from heavy clay to coarse sand; thus texture does not seem to be limiting. Although tamarack can grow well on [[calcareous]] soils, it is not abundant on the [[limestone]] areas of eastern [[Ontario]].\n\n[[File:2015-08-20 17 12 36 Tamarack seedling in a sphagnum bog adjacent to Taborton Road (Rensselaer County Route 42) in Sand Lake, New York.jpg|thumb|upright|Tamarack sapling in a sphagnum bog]]\nTamarack is commonly an early invader.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=44751 |title=Black Spruce |first=C.

In the lake states, tamarack may appear first in the [[sedge mat]], sphagnum moss, or not until the bog shrub stage. Farther north, it is the pioneer tree in the bog shrub stage. Tamarack is fairly well adapted to reproduce successfully on burns, so it is one of the common [[pioneer species|pioneers]] on sites in the boreal forest immediately after a fire.\n\nThe central [[Alaska]]n population, separated from the eastern [[Yukon]] populations by a gap of about {{convert|700|km|mi}}, is treated as a distinct variety ''Larix laricina'' var. ''alaskensis'' by some botanists, though others argue that it is not sufficiently distinct to be distinguished.\n\n== Associated forest cover ==\n[[File:Tamarack.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Young tree with fall colors]]\nTamarack forms extensive pure stands in the [[Boreal ecosystem|boreal]] region of [[Canada]] and in northern [[Minnesota]]. In the rest of its [[United States]] range and in the [[Maritime Provinces]], tamarack is found locally in both pure and mixed stands. It is a major component in the [[Society of American Foresters]] (SAF) [[forest cover type]]s Tamarack and [[black spruce\u2013tamarack]].\n\n[[Black spruce]] (''Picea mariana'') is usually tamarack's main associate in mixed stands on all sites. The other most common associates include [[balsam fir]] (''Abies balsamea''), [[white spruce]] (''Picea glauca''), and [[quaking aspen]] (''Populus tremuloides'') in the boreal region. In the better organic soil sites in the northern forest region, the most common associates are the [[northern white-cedar]] (''Thuja occidentalis''), balsam fir, [[Fraxinus nigra|black ash]] (''Fraxinus nigra''), and [[red maple]] (''Acer rubrum''). In [[Alaska]], quaking aspen and tamarack are almost never found together. Additional common associates are [[American elm]] (''Ulmus americana''), [[balsam poplar]] (''Populus balsamifera''), [[jack pine]] (''Pinus banksiana''), [[paper birch]] (''Betula papyrifera''), [[Kenai birch]] (''B. papyrifera'' var. ''kenaica''), and [[yellow birch]] (''B. alleghaniensis'').\n\nTamarack stands cast light shade and so usually have a dense undergrowth of shrubs and herbs. Because the tree has an extensive range, a great variety of shrubs is associated with it. Dominant tall shrubs include [[American dwarf birch|dwarf]] and [[swamp birch]] (''Betula glandulosa'' and ''Betula pumila''), [[willow]]s (''Salix'' spp.), [[speckled alder]] (''Alnus rugosa''), and [[red-osier dogwood]] (''Cornus stolonifera''). Low shrubs include [[bog Labrador tea]] (''Ledum groenlandicum''), [[bog-rosemary]] (''Andromeda glaucophylla''), [[leather leaf]] (''Chamaedaphne calyculata''), and [[small cranberry]] (''Vaccinium oxycoccos''). Characteristically the herbaceous cover includes [[Carex|sedges]] ''(Carex'' spp.), [[cottongrass]] ''(Eriophorum'' spp.), [[three-leaved false Solomonseal]] (''Maianthemum trifolium''), [[marsh cinquefoil]] (''Potentilla palustris''), [[Caltha palustris|marsh-marigold]] (''Caltha palustris''), and [[bogbean]] (''Menyanthes trifoliata''). Ground cover is usually composed of [[sphagnum moss]] ''([[Sphagnum]]'' spp.) and other mosses.\n\n== Seed cones and pollen cones ==\nTamarack is [[monoecious]].  Male and female cones are small, either solitary or in groups of 2 or 3, and appear with the needles. Male cones are yellow and are borne mainly on 1- or 2-year-old [[branchlet]]s. Female cones resemble tiny roses.  They are reddish or maroon, have needles at their base which are shorter and bluer than the other needles on the tree.  They are borne most commonly on 2 to 4-year-old branchlets, but may also appear on branchlets 5 or more years old. Cones usually are produced on young growth of vigorous trees. On open-grown trees, cones are borne on all parts of the crown. Mature seed cones are brown, oblong-ovoid, and {{convert|13|to|19|mm|in|frac=16|abbr=on}} long.\n\n== Uses ==\n[[File:Larix laricina bonsai by Nick Lenz.jpg|thumb|upright|''Larix laricina'' bonsai]]\nThe [[wood]] is tough and durable, but also flexible in thin strips, and was used by the [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] people for making [[snowshoe]]s and other products where toughness was required. The natural crooks located in the stumps and roots are also preferred for creating [[Knee (construction)|knees]] in wooden boats. Currently, the wood is used principally for [[pulpwood]], but also for posts, poles, rough lumber, and fuelwood; it is not a major commercial timber species.it is also used in horse stables to resist abrasion and kicking damage. <ref name=FEIS>{{FEIS |genus=Larix |species=laricina |type=tree |last=Uchytil |first=Ronald J. |year=1991}}</ref>\n\nIt is also grown as an [[ornamental tree]] in gardens in cold regions.

Tamarack trees were used before 1917 in [[Alberta]] to mark the northeast corner of sections surveyed within townships. They were used by the surveyors because at that time the very rot-resistant wood was readily available in the bush and was light to carry.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Their rot resistance was also why they were often used in early water distribution systems.\n\nThe aboriginal peoples of Canada's northwest regions used the inner bark as a poultice to treat cuts, infected wounds, [[frostbite]], boils and hemorrhoids.  The outer bark and roots are also said to have been used with another plant as a treatment for [[arthritis]], cold and general aches and pains.<ref>{{cite book |title=Aboriginal Plant Use in Canada's Northwest Boreal Forest |first=Robin James |last=Marles |publisher=Canadian Forest Service |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-660-19869-9 |page=<!--missing-->}}</ref>\n\nWildlife use the tree for food and nesting. Porcupines eat the inner bark, snowshoe hares feeds on tamarack seedlings, and red squirrels eat the seeds.<ref>{{Silvics |volume=1 |genus=Larix |species=laricina |first=William F. |last=Johnston |accessdate=2015-12-04}}</ref> Birds that frequent tamaracks during the summer include the white-throated sparrow, song sparrow, veery, common yellow throat, and Nashville warbler.<ref>Dawson, Deanna K. 1979.

North Central Forest Experiment Station, St. Paul, MN.</ref>\n\n== Reaction to competition ==\nTamarack is very intolerant of shade. Although it can tolerate some shade during the first several years, it must become dominant to survive. When mixed with other species, it must be in the over story. The tree is a good self-pruner, and boles of 25- to 30-year-old trees may be clear for one-half or two-thirds their length.\n\nBecause tamarack is very shade-intolerant, it does not become established in its own shade. Consequently, the more tolerant black spruce eventually succeeds tamarack on poor bog sites, whereas northern white-cedar, balsam fir, and swamp hardwoods succeed tamarack on good swamp sites. Recurring [[sawfly]] outbreaks throughout the range of tamarack have probably speeded the usual succession to black spruce or other associates.\n\nVarious tests on planting and natural reproduction indicate that competing vegetation hinders tamarack establishment.\n\nThe shade-intolerance of tamarack dictates the use of even-aged management. Some adaptation of clear cutting or seed-tree cutting is generally considered the best [[silvicultural]] system because tamarack seeds apparently germinate better in the open, and the seedlings require practically full light to survive and grow well. Tamarack is also usually wind-firm enough for the seed-tree system to succeed. Satisfactory reestablishment of tamarack, however, often requires some kind of site preparation, such as slash disposal and [[herbicide]] spraying.\n\n== Damaging agents ==\nThe tamarack has thin bark and is therefore highly susceptible to fire damage, except perhaps in older, upland stands. However, the habitat of tamarack, especially south of the [[Boreal ecosystem|boreal]] forest, is normally wet enough to protect the tree from fire. The tamarack is also susceptible to high winds. Strong winds can uproot large tamarack trees growing in swamps or other wet-land sites where rooting is shallow. It has also been discovered that abnormally high water levels often kill tamarack stands. Those that survive under such conditions usually grow very slowly. Other effects of high water include dieback and the development of adventitious roots and shoots. Wetland road crossings and beaver damming are the primary causes of flooding.\n\nMany insect species are known to be destructive to tamaracks. The non-indigenous [[larch sawfly]] is the most destructive. Epidemics occur periodically across [[Canada]] and the northern [[United States]] and have caused tremendous losses of merchantable tamarack throughout most of the tree's range. Indications are that radial increment declines markedly after 4 to 6 years of outbreak. After 6 to 9 years of moderate to heavy defoliation, the trees die. In southeastern [[Manitoba]] and northern [[Minnesota]], however, imported parasites of the sawfly have become established and should reduce the frequency and duration of future outbreaks. Another serious defoliator is the [[larch casebearer]] ''[[Coleophora laricella]]''. The [[larch casebearer]] attacks tamarack of all ages, and several severe outbreaks have caused extensive mortality in some areas. Outbreak severity has lessened in recent years, however, probably due to imported parasites of the casebearer that have become widely established.\n\nOnly a few other insects and related organisms (such as [[mites]]) that feed on tamarack are known to sometimes cause serious injury. During an outbreak, the [[spruce budworm]] (''[[Choristoneura fumiferana]]'') can severely damage tamarack. The [[larch-bud moth]] (''[[Zeiraphera improbana]]'') has had occasional short epidemics, and the [[spruce spider mite]] (''[[Oligonychus ununguis]]'') is occasionally found in large numbers on tamarack. The [[Argyresthia laricella|larch-shoot moth]] ''([[Argyresthia laricella]])'' is widely distributed, but serious injury is unusual. One of the most common bark beetles attacking tamarack is the [[eastern larch beetle]] (''[[Dendroctonus simplex]]''), but it feeds mainly on weakened, dying, or dead trees.\n\nTamarack is a host to many pathogens, but only one cause diseases serious enough to have an economic impact on its culture, the ''[[Lachnellula willkommii]]'' fungus. It is a relatively new pathogen in Canada, first recorded in 1980 and originating in Europe. The fungus cause large [[canker]]s to form and a disease known as [[Larch#Diseases|larch canker]] which is particularly harmful to the tamarack larch, killing both young and mature trees.<ref>[http://www.exoticpests.gc.ca/es-details/disease/1000096 European larch canker] Natural Resources Canada</ref> Apart from this, the only common foliage diseases are rusts, such as the leaf rust in eastern and central North America.

{"title_page": "Deep Adaptation", "text_new": "'''Deep Adaptation: A Map for Navigating Climate Tragedy''' is a 34-page paper self-published by [[Jem Bendell]] in July 2018. The paper argues that a near-term breakdown in human civilization will occur, with no chance of averting this breakdown, and suggests that the way to move forward is through 'deep adaptation.' Though the article has been criticized by climate scientists, it has been downloaded over half a million times and has started a 'deep adaptation' movement with thousands of members. \n\n== Content ==\nBendell describes ''Deep Adaptation'' as an ethical or philosophical framework, rather than as a projection.<ref name=\"Vice-Feb2019-DepressingPaper\" /> The paper describes not only near-term collapse, but also suggests the importance of envisioning what do afterwards while trying to restructure society to address the 'post-collapse' future. Bendell argues that efforts to lower emissions, using [[geoengineering]], and large-scale infrastructure changes are now insufficient to avert systemic upheaval. Bendell describes a three-part strategy to allow 'deep adaptation' to climate change: \"resilience\" through infrastructure upgrades, \"relinquishment\" by giving up aspects of civilization that lead to additional climate risk, and \"restoration,\" a return to older culture values and practices.<ref name=\"Minnpost-Aug2018-NewOutlook\">{{cite news |last1=Meador |first1=Ron |title=New outlook on global warming: Best prepare for social collapse, and soon |url=https://www.minnpost.com/earth-journal/2018/10/new-outlook-on-global-warming-best-prepare-for-social-collapse-and-soon/ |accessdate=20 April 2020 |work=MinnPost |date=15 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n''Deep Adaptation's'' writing style is dissimilar to most academic works, including figurative language, dark humor, and the stark conclusion that \"climate-induced societal collapse is now inevitable in the near term,\" in around a decade.<ref name=\"Vice-Feb2019-DepressingPaper\">{{cite news |last1=Tsjeng |first1=Zing |title=The Climate Change Paper So Depressing It's Sending People to Therapy |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vbwpdb/the-climate-change-paper-so-depressing-its-sending-people-to-therapy |accessdate=20 April 2020 |work=Vice |date=27 February 2019 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"Minnpost-Aug2018-NewOutlook\"/>\n\n== Publication ==\nBendell used his 2017 sabbatical to review climate science.  Bendell began writing ''Deep Adaption'' towards the end of this time period, describing his interpretation of [[Scientific consensus on climate change|the current state of climate research]].<ref name=\"Vice-Feb2019-DepressingPaper\"/>\n\nBendell initially submitted his paper for publication at the ''Sustainability Accounting, Management and Policy Journal'', but was not able to do so.<ref name=\"Vice-Feb2019-DepressingPaper\" /><ref name=\"Vice-AlreadyBegun\" /> Bendell instead decided to publish the paper on his blog and through the Institute for Leadership and Sustainability, a department at the [[University of Cumbria]] started by Bendell.<ref name=\"Vice-Feb2019-DepressingPaper\" />\n\nBendell argues on his blog that the journal requested major revisions for political reasons.<ref name=\"Vice-Feb2019-DepressingPaper\" /><ref name=\"Vice-AlreadyBegun\" /> The publisher disputes this claim, stating that the paper went through a standard review process and that the paper required major revisions due to a lack of scientific rigor. The publisher has requested that Bendell revise his blog post to reflect this statement, but as of February 2019 he had not done so.<ref name=\"Vice-Feb2019-DepressingPaper\" />\n\nThe paper has been translated into a variety of languages.<ref name=\"BBC-April2020-ClimateDoomers\" />\n\n== Reception ==\n=== From the scientific community ===\nProminent climate scientists have dismissed Bendell's predictions. One of the reviewers at the time, climatologist [[Michael E. Mann]], and [[Gavin Schmidt]], head of NASA's [[Goddard Institute for Space Studies]], had criticisms of the paper's core scientific arguments. The reviewer and Mann suggested that the paper's conclusions do not follow climate science, with Mann describing the paper as \"pseudo-scientific nonsense.\" Further, Mann expresses concern that Bendell's \"doomist framing\" may \"lead us down the same very path of inaction as outright climate change denial.

The paper argues that a near-term breakdown in human civilization will occur, with no chance of averting this breakdown, and suggests that the way to move forward is through 'deep adaptation.' Though the article has been criticized by climate scientists, it has been downloaded over half a million times and has started a 'deep adaptation' movement with thousands of members. \n\n== Content ==\nBendell describes ''Deep Adaptation'' as an ethical or philosophical framework, rather than as a projection.<ref name=\"Vice-Feb2019-DepressingPaper\" /> The paper describes not only near-term collapse, but also suggests the importance of envisioning what do afterwards while trying to restructure society to address the 'post-collapse' future. Bendell argues that efforts to lower emissions, using [[geoengineering]], and large-scale infrastructure changes are now insufficient to avert systemic upheaval. Bendell describes a three-part strategy to allow 'deep adaptation' to climate change: \"resilience\" through infrastructure upgrades, \"relinquishment\" by giving up aspects of civilization that lead to additional climate risk, and \"restoration,\" a return to older culture values and practices.<ref name=\"Minnpost-Aug2018-NewOutlook\">{{cite news |last1=Meador |first1=Ron |title=New outlook on global warming: Best prepare for social collapse, and soon |url=https://www.minnpost.com/earth-journal/2018/10/new-outlook-on-global-warming-best-prepare-for-social-collapse-and-soon/ |accessdate=20 April 2020 |work=MinnPost |date=15 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n''Deep Adaptation's'' writing style is dissimilar to most academic works, including figurative language, dark humor, and the stark conclusion that \"climate-induced societal collapse is now inevitable in the near term,\" in around a decade.<ref name=\"Vice-Feb2019-DepressingPaper\">{{cite news |last1=Tsjeng |first1=Zing |title=The Climate Change Paper So Depressing It's Sending People to Therapy |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vbwpdb/the-climate-change-paper-so-depressing-its-sending-people-to-therapy |accessdate=20 April 2020 |work=Vice |date=27 February 2019 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"Minnpost-Aug2018-NewOutlook\"/>\n\n== Publication ==\nBendell used his 2017 sabbatical to review climate science.

The reviewer and Mann suggested that the paper's conclusions do not follow climate science, with Mann describing the paper as \"pseudo-scientific nonsense.\" Further, Mann expresses concern that Bendell's \"doomist framing\" may \"lead us down the same very path of inaction as outright climate change denial. Fossil fuel interests love this framing.\" Schmidt argued that, though local collapse events might occur more frequently as climatic changes progress, the paper fails entirely to show why global collapse might occur.

It was the band's first album following the departure of multi-instrumentalist [[Jim O'Rourke (musician)|Jim O'Rourke]], who had joined as a fifth member in 1999. Unlike its immediate predecessors, the album was produced by [[John Agnello]] and recorded at Sear Sound in New York City, the same studio where the band's 1994 album, ''[[Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star]]'', was recorded. It also completed Sonic Youth's contract with Geffen, which released the band's previous eight records.\n\n''Rather Ripped'' is considered to be one of Sonic Youth's most accessible albums, featuring an abundance of concise songs dealing with melancholic topics such as adultery, sexual frustration, and infidelity. Upon its release, the album peaked at number 71 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and number 64 on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. It received mostly positive reviews from critics, who praised its simpler, cleaner melodies and the vocal delivery of singer and bassist [[Kim Gordon]]. The album was ranked number 12 in ''[[The Village Voice]]''{{'}}s 2006 [[Pazz & Jop]] critics' poll. Its only [[Single (music)|single]], \"Incinerate\", was released in 2006, alongside an accompanying [[music video]] directed by French director and writer [[Claire Denis]].\n\n==Background and recording==\n''Rather Ripped'' is the follow-up to [[Sonic Youth]]'s 2004 album ''[[Sonic Nurse]]'' and the band's first record after the departure of multi-instrumentalist [[Jim O'Rourke (musician)|Jim O'Rourke]], who joined the group as a fifth member in 1999.<ref name=\"LA CityBeat article\"/> According to guitarist [[Lee Ranaldo]], O'Rourke left the band to pursue film work and other recording projects.<ref name=\"O'Rourke leaves\"/> His departure affected the sound of ''Rather Ripped'', with singer and guitarist [[Thurston Moore]] stating that the new record \"is just a far more straight up rock and roll album\", in contrast to the \"darker, twisted, complex quality\" of O'Rourke's contributions.<ref name=\"CMJ article\"/> Partially inspired by the streamlined approach taken by [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] for their 1978 commercial breakthrough ''[[Parallel Lines]]'',<ref name=\"Wire Raw+Kooked\"/> Moore decided to write simpler songs \"for everybody to plug into immediately.\"<ref name=\"CMJ article\"/> While he conceded ''Parallel Lines'' features some \"super good\" songs, he was disappointed with the album's [[Pop music|poppier]] style and [[Mike Chapman]]'s production when it was released.<ref name=\"Wire Raw+Kooked\"/> Nevertheless, he recognized that ''Parallel Lines'' became Blondie's breakthrough with the general public, and aimed to make ''Rather Ripped'' into Sonic Youth's version of ''Parallel Lines''.<ref name=\"Wire Raw+Kooked\"/> The album's working titles were \"Sonic Life\" and \"Do You Believe in Rapture?\".<ref name=\"CMJ article\"/> The name \"Rather Ripped\" came from a [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[California]] record store that later moved to [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]].<ref name=\"Pitchfork review\"/><ref name=\"Rather Ripped Records\"/>\n\nUnlike its immediate predecessors, which were recorded at the band's own Echo Canyon studio in [[Lower Manhattan]], ''Rather Ripped'' was recorded at Sear Sound in New York City from December 2005 to January 2006, where their 1994 album ''[[Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star]]'' was also recorded.<ref name=\"SY Begins recording\"/> The album was quickly produced and much of the material was not reworked due to the band's limited time in the studio.<ref name=\"Milwaukee Journal\"/> During the recording sessions, Moore's gear included two [[Fender Jazzmaster]]s and a [[Fender Princeton]]. Ranaldo, on the other hand, played a [[Gibson Les Paul]] guitar for half of the album and used his [[Fender Telecaster Deluxe]], \"Jazzmaster copy-made\" by [[Saul Koll]], and modified Fender Jazzmaster with [[humbucker]]s for the remaining tracks.<ref name=\"Stripped-Down\"/> Guitars were directly plugged into the mixer with no [[guitar amplifier]] in the [[signal chain]].<ref name=\"Stripped-Down\"/> The band chose [[John Agnello]] as the album's [[Audio engineer|engineer]] due to his work with [[Don Fleming (musician)|Don Fleming]] on albums by [[Screaming Trees]] in the early 1990s. He was recommended by fellow musician [[J Mascis]] of [[Dinosaur Jr.]], who had worked with Agnello for years.<ref name=\"Stripped-Down\"/> Additional work was done in early 2006 at Echo Canyon and J Mascis's Bisquiteen studio in [[Amherst, Massachusetts]].<ref name=\"RR Booklet\"/> The album was [[Audio mastering|mastered]] by [[Greg Calbi]] at [[Sterling Sound]] in New York City in March 2006.<ref name=\"RR Booklet\"/>\n\n==Music and lyrics==\n''Rather Ripped'' is generally considered one of the band's most accessible albums, featuring an abundance of concise and catchy melodies.<ref name=\"Milwaukee Journal\"/><ref name=\"The Guardian Review\"/><ref name=\"RS Review\"/> Moore described it as \"a super song record\" that contains \"rockers and ballads\".<ref name=\"CMJ article\"/> In addition, seven of the album's 12 tracks have a duration of less than four minutes, a feature that is uncommon in previous Sonic Youth releases.<ref name=\"Rather Exhilarating\"/> The album generally favors guitar textures over [[guitar feedback|feedback]] or [[Noise rock|noise]], which typically characterized the band's earlier works.<ref name=\"PopMatters Review\"/> Dave Heaton of ''[[PopMatters]]'' remarked that the guitars on ''Rather Ripped'' are joined together to form a vibrant and mysterious sound, stating that \"it often feels like Sonic Youth are taking all the instrumental tricks they've learned over the years and putting them in the service of building a lasting landscape of guitar sounds, one that reverberates with the sounds of the past but also feels eternally youthful\".<ref name=\"PopMatters Review\"/>\n\nLyrically, ''Rather Ripped'' deals with melancholic topics about adultery, sexual frustration and infidelity.<ref name=\"The Guardian Review\"/><ref name=\"Slant Review\"/> In the opening track, \"Reena\", whose working title was \"Stonesy\",<ref name=\"Psychic Confusion\"/> singer and bassist [[Kim Gordon]] is involved in a secondary relationship with a woman.<ref name=\"Pitchfork review\"/> Lead single \"Incinerate\" is built on a conventional love-as-fire metaphor, while \"What a Waste\" attributes sexual lust.<ref name=\"Goodbye 20th Century\"/> \"Pink Steam\", which is the longest track of the album, features a lengthy instrumental part that was described as \"gorgeously windswept and violently romantic\".<ref name=\"Pitchfork review\"/> Its title was taken from a book by San Francisco author [[Dodie Bellamy]].<ref name=\"Standard Hotels\"/> The song \"Do You Believe in Rapture?\" is a political reflection on [[Christians]] in the office,<ref name=\"PopMatters Review\"/> while \"Rats\", which is the only song on the album written by Ranaldo, was described as a \"fulfilling ghost-narrative\".<ref name=\"AllMusic Review\"/> The album ends with the semi-acoustic ballad \"Or\", which starts with strip-club imagery and ends with Moore recounting various interview-like questions such as \"What comes first? The music or the words?\"<ref name=\"PopMatters Review\"/>\n\n==Release==\n''Rather Ripped'' was released on June 13, 2006 and completed Sonic Youth's contract with major label [[Geffen Records]], which also released the band's previous eight albums.<ref name=\"PopMatters Review\"/> The UK edition of the album includes two [[outtake]]s, \"Helen Lundeberg\" and \"Eyeliner\", which were previously released as a 7\" [[Single (music)|single]] on the band's own label, [[Sonic Youth Recordings|Sonic Youth Records]].<ref name=\"Outtakes\"/> To promote the album, the band embarked on a tour across the United States, starting at New York's famed [[CBGB]] on June 13, 2006, where the band had not performed since 1992,<ref name=\"CBGB performance\"/> and ending at the [[Bank of America Pavilion]] in [[Boston]] on September 3, 2006.<ref name=\"Tour dates\"/> Bassist [[Mark Ibold]], formerly of the [[indie rock]] band [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]], joined the band as part of the touring group.<ref name=\"CBGB performance\"/>\n\nUpon release, ''Rather Ripped'' peaked at No. 71 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and No. 64 on the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name=\"Charts US\"/><ref name=\"Charts UK\"/> The album also charted in other countries, including Australia,<ref name=\"Charts Australia\"/> Belgium,<ref name=\"Charts Belgium Flanders\"/> Finland,<ref name=\"Charts Finland\"/> France<ref name=\"Charts France\"/> and Norway.<ref name=\"Charts Norway\"/> The song \"Incinerate\" was released as a single in France and Australia in 2006.<ref name=\"Incinerate\"/> Additionally, five [[music video]]s, one for \"Incinerate\" and four for \"Jams Run Free\", were directed by French director and writer [[Claire Denis]].<ref name=\"Music videos\"/> The video for \"Incinerate\" is a performance of the band that was recorded at Le Nouveau Casino in Paris prior to their 2006 tour in support of the album, while the others are set in an apartment and repeat images of cats, roofing tiles and TV antennas. The videos were shot with a consumer-grade digital video camera and feature a dissolving image resolution and fluctuating color palette.<ref name=\"Music videos\"/>\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| MC = 82/100<ref name=\"Metacritic\"/>\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"AllMusic Review\"/>\n| rev2 = ''[[The A.V.

He also praised Moore's lyrics, stating that \"his Beat-style poetry is especially evocative, and especially terse\u2014a quality that fits well with an album that musically seems to be doing much the same, communicating a lot with a little\".<ref name=\"PopMatters Review\"/> Similarly, Dave Simpson of ''[[The Guardian]]'' felt that the band reinvented themselves with [[Pop music|poppier]] songs, calling ''Rather Ripped'' \"an extraordinary state of affairs in Sonic Youth's 25th year\".<ref name=\"The Guardian Review\"/>\n\nWriting for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Rob Sheffield]] highlighted Moore's guitar playing for giving the album \"a sense of emotional urgency\" and considered \"Incinerate\" and \"Pink Steam\" some of the album's highlights.<ref name=\"RS Review\"/> Gordon's vocal delivery was widely praised, with [[Ben Ratliff]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' comparing it favorably to [[The Velvet Underground]] singer and collaborator [[Nico]].<ref name=\"NY Times\"/> [[Robert Christgau]] also remarked that Gordon sounds \"breathlessly girlish\" despite being 53 at the time, and that both she and Moore \"evoke visions of dalliance, displacement, recrimination, and salvation that never become unequivocally literal\". He gave the album an \"A\" in his consumer guide review for [[Napster (streaming music service)|Rhapsody]].<ref name=\"CG\"/> Sheffield concluded that the album features her first worthwhile songs in a decade.<ref name=\"RS Review\"/>\n\nSteve Hochman of ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' credited the album's catchy melodies for being smartly and effectively handled, commenting that \"it almost makes you wonder what would have happened if [[Television (band)|Television]] and [[Peter Frampton]] had worked together\".<ref name=\"LA Times review\"/> Tom Sinclair of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote that, although the band \"can still knock out a noisy punk stomper when the mood strikes\" like on the track \"Sleepin Around\", the cleaner and quieter melodies are the ones that \"really rip up your emotions\".<ref name=\"EW review\"/> ''[[Slant Magazine|Slant]]''{{'}}s Jimmy Newlin stated similar pros, noting that \"quiet is the new loud\", and felt that the band's shift towards romantic poignancy was \"a welcome growth as the band advances well into its second decade of existence\".<ref name=\"Slant Review\"/>\n\nOther reviews were less enthusiastic. ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' editor Joe Gross criticized ''Rather Ripped'' for its lack of expansive songs, stating that the album \"is about three- or four-minute songcraft\u2014never the highlight of their r\u00e9sum\u00e9, even when [Gordon] lends her singular rasp\".<ref name=\"Spin review\"/> Brandon Stosuy of ''[[Pitchfork Media]]'' felt that the second half of the album was weaker than the first and criticized the lyrics of the closer \"Or\".<ref name=\"Pitchfork review\"/> [[AllMusic]] reviewer Heather Phares remarked that the band's playing can occasionally outpace their songwriting, but nevertheless judged ''Rather Ripped'' as \"a solidly good album\" that \"shows that Sonic Youth is still in a comfortable yet creative groove, not a rut\".<ref name=\"AllMusic Review\"/> ''Rather Ripped'' was ranked 12th in ''[[The Village Voice]]''{{'}}s 2006 [[Pazz & Jop]] critics' poll and 13th in ''[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]''{{'}}s annual critics' poll.<ref name=\"Pazz & Jop\"/><ref name=\"Wire Records of the Year\" /> ''Rolling Stone'' editors ranked the album third on their Top 50 Albums of 2006 list,<ref name=\"RS Top 2006\"/> while ''Pitchfork'' ranked it 43rd on a similar list.<ref name=\"Pitchfork Top 2006\"/>\n\n==Track listing==\n{{track listing\n| all_writing = Sonic Youth<ref name=\"RR Booklet\"/>\n| extra_column = Vocals\n| total_length = 51:53\n| title1 = Reena\n| extra1 = Gordon\n| length1 = 3:47\n| title2 = Incinerate\n| extra2 = Moore\n| length2 = 4:55\n| title3 = Do You Believe in Rapture?\n| extra3 = Moore\n| length3 = 3:11\n| title4 = Sleepin Around\n| extra4 = Moore\n| length4 = 3:42\n| title5 = What a Waste\n| extra5 = Gordon\n| length5 = 3:33\n| title6 = Jams Run Free\n| extra6 = Gordon\n| length6 = 3:52\n| title7 = Rats\n| extra7 = Ranaldo\n| length7 = 4:24\n| title8 = Turquoise Boy\n| extra8 = Gordon\n| length8 = 6:14\n| title9 = Lights Out\n| extra9 = Moore\n| length9 = 3:32\n| title10 = The Neutral\n| extra10 = Gordon\n| length10 = 4:09\n| title11 = Pink Steam\n| extra11 = Moore\n| length11 = 6:57\n| title12 = Or\n| extra12 = Moore\n| length12 = 3:31\n}}\n\n==Personnel==\nCredits are adapted from the album's [[liner notes]].<ref name=\"RR Booklet\"/>\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n; Sonic Youth\n* [[Thurston Moore]] \u2013 vocals, guitar, bass on \"Rats\", [[Record producer|production]], sleeve design\n* [[Kim Gordon]] \u2013 vocals, bass, guitar on \"Rats\", production\n* [[Lee Ranaldo]] \u2013 guitar, vocals, production, additional recording\n* [[Steve Shelley]] \u2013 drums, production\n; Design personnel\n* [[Christopher Wool]] \u2013 sleeve artwork\n* [[Amanda de Cadenet]] \u2013 band photography\n* JP Robinson \u2013 front cover design\n* Brandy Flower \u2013 sleeve design\n{{col-2}}\n; Technical personnel\n* [[John Agnello]] \u2013 production, [[Audio mixing|mixing]], additional recording\n* TJ Doherty \u2013 recording\n* Aaron Mullan \u2013 assistant engineer, additional recording\n* Chris Allen \u2013 assistant engineer\n* Anthony Fontana \u2013 assistant engineer\n* [[Don Fleming (musician)|Don Fleming]] \u2013 additional vocal production\n* [[Greg Calbi]] \u2013 [[Audio mastering|mastering]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Charts==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!Chart (2006)\n!Peak\n|-\n!

Youth]], released on June 13, 2006 by [[Geffen Records]]. It was the band's first album following the departure of multi-instrumentalist [[Jim O'Rourke (musician)|Jim O'Rourke]], who had joined as a fifth member in 1999. Unlike its immediate predecessors, the album was produced by [[John Agnello]] and recorded at Sear Sound in New York City, the same studio where the band's 1994 album, ''[[Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star]]'', was recorded. It also completed Sonic Youth's contract with Geffen, which released the band's previous eight records.\n\n''Rather Ripped'' is considered to be one of Sonic Youth's most accessible albums, featuring an abundance of concise songs dealing with melancholic topics such as adultery, sexual frustration, and infidelity. Upon its release, the album peaked at number 71 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and number 64 on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. It received mostly positive reviews from critics, who praised its simpler, cleaner melodies and the vocal delivery of singer and bassist [[Kim Gordon]]. The album was ranked number 12 in ''[[The Village Voice]]''{{'}}s 2006 [[Pazz & Jop]] critics' poll. Its only [[Single (music)|single]], \"Incinerate\", was released in 2006, alongside an accompanying [[music video]] directed by French director and writer [[Claire Denis]].\n\n==Background and recording==\n''Rather Ripped'' is the follow-up to [[Sonic Youth]]'s 2004 album ''[[Sonic Nurse]]'' and the band's first record after the departure of multi-instrumentalist [[Jim O'Rourke (musician)|Jim O'Rourke]], who joined the group as a fifth member in 1999.<ref name=\"LA CityBeat article\"/> According to guitarist [[Lee Ranaldo]], O'Rourke left the band to pursue film work and other recording projects.<ref name=\"O'Rourke leaves\"/> His departure affected the sound of ''Rather Ripped'', with singer and guitarist [[Thurston Moore]] stating that the new record \"is just a far more straight up rock and roll album\", in contrast to the \"darker, twisted, complex quality\" of O'Rourke's contributions.<ref name=\"CMJ article\"/> Partially inspired by the streamlined approach taken by [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] for their 1978 commercial breakthrough ''[[Parallel Lines]]'',<ref name=\"Wire Raw+Kooked\"/> Moore decided to write simpler songs \"for everybody to plug into immediately.\"<ref name=\"CMJ article\"/> While he conceded ''Parallel Lines'' features some \"super good\" songs, he was disappointed with the album's [[Pop music|poppier]] style and [[Mike Chapman]]'s production when it was released.<ref name=\"Wire Raw+Kooked\"/> Nevertheless, he recognized that ''Parallel Lines'' became Blondie's breakthrough with the general public, and aimed to make ''Rather Ripped'' into Sonic Youth's version of ''Parallel Lines''.<ref name=\"Wire Raw+Kooked\"/> The album's working titles were \"Sonic Life\" and \"Do You Believe in Rapture?\".<ref name=\"CMJ article\"/> The name \"Rather Ripped\" came from a [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[California]] record store that later moved to [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]].<ref name=\"Pitchfork review\"/><ref name=\"Rather Ripped Records\"/>\n\nUnlike its immediate predecessors, which were recorded at the band's own Echo Canyon studio in [[Lower Manhattan]], ''Rather Ripped'' was recorded at Sear Sound in New York City from December 2005 to January 2006, where their 1994 album ''[[Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star]]'' was also recorded.<ref name=\"SY Begins recording\"/> The album was quickly produced and much of the material was not reworked due to the band's limited time in the studio.<ref name=\"Milwaukee Journal\"/> During the recording sessions, Moore's gear included two [[Fender Jazzmaster]]s and a [[Fender Princeton]]. Ranaldo, on the other hand, played a [[Gibson Les Paul]] guitar for half of the album and used his [[Fender Telecaster Deluxe]], \"Jazzmaster copy-made\" by [[Saul Koll]], and modified Fender Jazzmaster with [[humbucker]]s for the remaining tracks.<ref name=\"Stripped-Down\"/> Guitars were directly plugged into the mixer with no [[guitar amplifier]] in the [[signal chain]].<ref name=\"Stripped-Down\"/> The band chose [[John Agnello]] as the album's [[Audio engineer|engineer]] due to his work with [[Don Fleming (musician)|Don Fleming]] on albums by [[Screaming Trees]] in the early 1990s. He was recommended by fellow musician [[J Mascis]] of [[Dinosaur Jr.]], who had worked with Agnello for years.<ref name=\"Stripped-Down\"/> Additional work was done in early 2006 at Echo Canyon and J Mascis's Bisquiteen studio in [[Amherst, Massachusetts]].<ref name=\"RR Booklet\"/> The album was [[Audio mastering|mastered]] by [[Greg Calbi]] at [[Sterling Sound]] in New York City in March 2006.<ref name=\"RR Booklet\"/>\n\n==Music and lyrics==\n''Rather Ripped'' is generally considered one of the band's most accessible albums, featuring an abundance of concise and catchy melodies.<ref name=\"Milwaukee Journal\"/><ref name=\"The Guardian Review\"/><ref name=\"RS Review\"/> Moore described it as \"a super song record\" that contains \"rockers and ballads\".<ref name=\"CMJ article\"/> In addition, seven of the album's 12 tracks have a duration of less than four minutes, a feature that is uncommon in previous Sonic Youth releases.<ref name=\"Rather Exhilarating\"/> The album generally favors guitar textures over [[guitar feedback|feedback]] or [[Noise rock|noise]], which typically characterized the band's earlier works.<ref name=\"PopMatters Review\"/> Dave Heaton of ''[[PopMatters]]'' remarked that the guitars on ''Rather Ripped'' are joined together to form a vibrant and mysterious sound, stating that \"it often feels like Sonic Youth are taking all the instrumental tricks they've learned over the years and putting them in the service of building a lasting landscape of guitar sounds, one that reverberates with the sounds of the past but also feels eternally youthful\".<ref name=\"PopMatters Review\"/>\n\nLyrically, ''Rather Ripped'' deals with melancholic topics about adultery, sexual frustration and infidelity.<ref name=\"The Guardian Review\"/><ref name=\"Slant Review\"/> In the opening track, \"Reena\", whose working title was \"Stonesy\",<ref name=\"Psychic Confusion\"/> singer and bassist [[Kim Gordon]] is involved in a secondary relationship with a woman.<ref name=\"Pitchfork review\"/> Lead single \"Incinerate\" is built on a conventional love-as-fire metaphor, while \"What a Waste\" attributes sexual lust.<ref name=\"Goodbye 20th Century\"/> \"Pink Steam\", which is the longest track of the album, features a lengthy instrumental part that was described as \"gorgeously windswept and violently romantic\".<ref name=\"Pitchfork review\"/> Its title was taken from a book by San Francisco author [[Dodie Bellamy]].<ref name=\"Standard Hotels\"/> The song \"Do You Believe in Rapture?\" is a political reflection on [[Christians]] in the office,<ref name=\"PopMatters Review\"/> while \"Rats\", which is the only song on the album written by Ranaldo, was described as a \"fulfilling ghost-narrative\".<ref name=\"AllMusic Review\"/> The album ends with the semi-acoustic ballad \"Or\", which starts with strip-club imagery and ends with Moore recounting various interview-like questions such as \"What comes first? The music or the words?\"<ref name=\"PopMatters Review\"/>\n\n==Release==\n''Rather Ripped'' was released on June 13, 2006 and completed Sonic Youth's contract with major label [[Geffen Records]], which also released the band's previous eight albums.<ref name=\"PopMatters Review\"/> The UK edition of the album includes two [[outtake]]s, \"Helen Lundeberg\" and \"Eyeliner\", which were previously released as a 7\" [[Single (music)|single]] on the band's own label, [[Sonic Youth Recordings|Sonic Youth Records]].<ref name=\"Outtakes\"/> To promote the album, the band embarked on a tour across the United States, starting at New York's famed [[CBGB]] on June 13, 2006, where the band had not performed since 1992,<ref name=\"CBGB performance\"/> and ending at the [[Bank of America Pavilion]] in [[Boston]] on September 3, 2006.<ref name=\"Tour dates\"/> Bassist [[Mark Ibold]], formerly of the [[indie rock]] band [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]], joined the band as part of the touring group.<ref name=\"CBGB performance\"/>\n\nUpon release, ''Rather Ripped'' peaked at No. 71 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and No. 64 on the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name=\"Charts US\"/><ref name=\"Charts UK\"/> The album also charted in other countries, including Australia,<ref name=\"Charts Australia\"/> Belgium,<ref name=\"Charts Belgium Flanders\"/> Finland,<ref name=\"Charts Finland\"/> France<ref name=\"Charts France\"/> and Norway.<ref name=\"Charts Norway\"/> The song \"Incinerate\" was released as a single in France and Australia in 2006.<ref name=\"Incinerate\"/> Additionally, five [[music video]]s, one for \"Incinerate\" and four for \"Jams Run Free\", were directed by French director and writer [[Claire Denis]].<ref name=\"Music videos\"/> The video for \"Incinerate\" is a performance of the band that was recorded at Le Nouveau Casino in Paris prior to their 2006 tour in support of the album, while the others are set in an apartment and repeat images of cats, roofing tiles and TV antennas. The videos were shot with a consumer-grade digital video camera and feature a dissolving image resolution and fluctuating color palette.<ref name=\"Music videos\"/>\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| MC = 82/100<ref name=\"Metacritic\"/>\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"AllMusic Review\"/>\n| rev2 = ''[[The A.V.

He also praised Moore's lyrics, stating that \"his Beat-style poetry is especially evocative, and especially terse\u2014a quality that fits well with an album that musically seems to be doing much the same, communicating a lot with a little\".<ref name=\"PopMatters Review\"/> Similarly, Dave Simpson of ''[[The Guardian]]'' felt that the band reinvented themselves with [[Pop music|poppier]] songs, calling ''Rather Ripped'' \"an extraordinary state of affairs in Sonic Youth's 25th year\".<ref name=\"The Guardian Review\"/>\n\nWriting for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Rob Sheffield]] highlighted Moore's guitar playing for giving the album \"a sense of emotional urgency\" and considered \"Incinerate\" and \"Pink Steam\" some of the album's highlights.<ref name=\"RS Review\"/> Gordon's vocal delivery was widely praised, with [[Ben Ratliff]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' comparing it favorably to [[The Velvet Underground]] singer and collaborator [[Nico]].<ref name=\"NY Times\"/> [[Robert Christgau]] also remarked that Gordon sounds \"breathlessly girlish\" despite being 53 at the time, and that both she and Moore \"evoke visions of dalliance, displacement, recrimination, and salvation that never become unequivocally literal\". He gave the album an \"A\" in his consumer guide review for [[Napster (streaming music service)|Rhapsody]].<ref name=\"CG\"/> Sheffield concluded that the album features her first worthwhile songs in a decade.<ref name=\"RS Review\"/>\n\nSteve Hochman of ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' credited the album's catchy melodies for being smartly and effectively handled, commenting that \"it almost makes you wonder what would have happened if [[Television (band)|Television]] and [[Peter Frampton]] had worked together\".<ref name=\"LA Times review\"/> Tom Sinclair of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote that, although the band \"can still knock out a noisy punk stomper when the mood strikes\" like on the track \"Sleepin Around\", the cleaner and quieter melodies are the ones that \"really rip up your emotions\".<ref name=\"EW review\"/> ''[[Slant Magazine|Slant]]''{{'}}s Jimmy Newlin stated similar pros, noting that \"quiet is the new loud\", and felt that the band's shift towards romantic poignancy was \"a welcome growth as the band advances well into its second decade of existence\".<ref name=\"Slant Review\"/>\n\nOther reviews were less enthusiastic. ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' editor Joe Gross criticized ''Rather Ripped'' for its lack of expansive songs, stating that the album \"is about three- or four-minute songcraft\u2014never the highlight of their r\u00e9sum\u00e9, even when [Gordon] lends her singular rasp\".<ref name=\"Spin review\"/> Brandon Stosuy of ''[[Pitchfork Media]]'' felt that the second half of the album was weaker than the first and criticized the lyrics of the closer \"Or\".<ref name=\"Pitchfork review\"/> [[AllMusic]] reviewer Heather Phares remarked that the band's playing can occasionally outpace their songwriting, but nevertheless judged ''Rather Ripped'' as \"a solidly good album\" that \"shows that Sonic Youth is still in a comfortable yet creative groove, not a rut\".<ref name=\"AllMusic Review\"/> ''Rather Ripped'' was ranked 12th in ''[[The Village Voice]]''{{'}}s 2006 [[Pazz & Jop]] critics' poll and 13th in ''[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]''{{'}}s annual critics' poll.<ref name=\"Pazz & Jop\"/><ref name=\"Wire Records of the Year\" /> ''Rolling Stone'' editors ranked the album third on their Top 50 Albums of 2006 list,<ref name=\"RS Top 2006\"/> while ''Pitchfork'' ranked it 43rd on a similar list.<ref name=\"Pitchfork Top 2006\"/>\n\n==Track listing==\n{{track listing\n| all_writing = Sonic Youth<ref name=\"RR Booklet\"/>\n| extra_column = Vocals\n| total_length = 51:53\n| title1 = Reena\n| extra1 = Gordon\n| length1 = 3:47\n| title2 = Incinerate\n| extra2 = Moore\n| length2 = 4:55\n| title3 = Do You Believe in Rapture?\n| extra3 = Moore\n| length3 = 3:11\n| title4 = Sleepin Around\n| extra4 = Moore\n| length4 = 3:42\n| title5 = What a Waste\n| extra5 = Gordon\n| length5 = 3:33\n| title6 = Jams Run Free\n| extra6 = Gordon\n| length6 = 3:52\n| title7 = Rats\n| extra7 = Ranaldo\n| length7 = 4:24\n| title8 = Turquoise Boy\n| extra8 = Gordon\n| length8 = 6:14\n| title9 = Lights Out\n| extra9 = Moore\n| length9 = 3:32\n| title10 = The Neutral\n| extra10 = Gordon\n| length10 = 4:09\n| title11 = Pink Steam\n| extra11 = Moore\n| length11 = 6:57\n| title12 = Or\n| extra12 = Moore\n| length12 = 3:31\n}}\n\n==Personnel==\nCredits are adapted from the album's [[liner notes]].<ref name=\"RR Booklet\"/>\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n; Sonic Youth\n* [[Thurston Moore]] \u2013 vocals, guitar, bass on \"Rats\", [[Record producer|production]], sleeve design\n* [[Kim Gordon]] \u2013 vocals, bass, guitar on \"Rats\", production\n* [[Lee Ranaldo]] \u2013 guitar, vocals, production, additional recording\n* [[Steve Shelley]] \u2013 drums, production\n; Design personnel\n* [[Christopher Wool]] \u2013 sleeve artwork\n* [[Amanda De Cadenet]] \u2013 band photography\n* JP Robinson \u2013 front cover design\n* Brandy Flower \u2013 sleeve design\n{{col-2}}\n; Technical personnel\n* [[John Agnello]] \u2013 production, [[Audio mixing|mixing]], additional recording\n* TJ Doherty \u2013 recording\n* Aaron Mullan \u2013 assistant engineer, additional recording\n* Chris Allen \u2013 assistant engineer\n* Anthony Fontana \u2013 assistant engineer\n* [[Don Fleming (musician)|Don Fleming]] \u2013 additional vocal production\n* [[Greg Calbi]] \u2013 [[Audio mastering|mastering]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Charts==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!Chart (2006)\n!Peak\n|-\n!
