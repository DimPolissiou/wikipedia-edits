Doherty was a member of the rock band Julia Thirteen, and asked Cook to produce some of the band's music. Although Julia Thirteen never recorded any further material, the experience proved vital, as Cook and Doherty formed a mutual partnership through music. A few years later, Doherty joined Cook as a member of the [[alternative rock]] band [[Aereogramme]], but the two quit in 2007 when they became frustrated with the band's sound and lack of exposure. Doherty was then offered a role as a touring member of [[The Twilight Sad]], but quit in 2012 after growing tired of playing someone else's music. The two had become jaded with alternative rock, and decided to start their own music project.<ref name=\"COS\">{{cite web |last=Arroyo |first=Steven |url= https://consequenceofsound.net/2013/09/cover-story-chvrches/2/|title=Chvrches: Catching the Light |work=[[Consequence of Sound]] |page=2 |date=22 September 2013 |accessdate=5 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nA few years after Cook left Aerogramme, he began listening to the American electronic music band [[Emeralds (band)|Emeralds]].

Doherty was a member of the rock band Julia Thirteen, and asked Cook to produce some of the band's music. Although Julia Thirteen never recorded any further material, the experience proved vital, as Cook and Doherty formed a mutual partnership through music. A few years later, Doherty joined Cook as a member of the [[alternative rock]] band [[Aereogramme]], but the two quit in 2007 when they became frustrated with the band's sound and lack of exposure. Doherty was then offered a role as a touring member of [[The Twilight Sad]], but quit in 2012 after growing tired of playing someone else's music. The two had become jaded with alternative rock, and decided to start their own music project.<ref name=\"COS\">{{cite web |last=Arroyo |first=Steven |url= https://consequenceofsound.net/2013/09/cover-story-chvrches/2/|title=Chvrches: Catching the Light |work=[[Consequence of Sound]] |page=2 |date=22 September 2013 |accessdate=5 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nA few years after Cook left Aerogramme, he began listening to the American electronic music band [[Emeralds (band)|Emeralds]].
