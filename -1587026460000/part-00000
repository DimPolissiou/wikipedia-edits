Some trace the origins to the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley civilization]], which reached its peak around 2500\u20132000 BCE.<ref>For dating as fl. 2300\u20132000 BCE, decline by 1800 BCE, and extinction by 1500 BCE see: Flood (1996), p. 24.</ref>{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=204\u2013205}} Archeological discoveries show seals that suggest a deity that somewhat appears like Shiva.

[[Gavin Flood]] characterizes these views as \"speculative\", saying that it is not clear from the seal if the figure has three faces, or is seated in a yoga posture, or even that the shape is intended to represent a human figure.{{sfn|Flood|1996|pp=28-29}}{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=204\u2013205}}\n\nOther scholars state that the Indus Valley script remains undeciphered, and the interpretation of the Pashupati seal is uncertain.

The text also includes a ''Satarudriya'', an influential hymn with embedded hundred epithets for Rudra, that is cited in many medieval era Shaiva texts as well as recited in major Shiva temples of Hindus in contemporary times.

They range from dualistic devotional theism to monistic meditative discovery of Shiva within oneself. Within each of these theologies, there are two sub-groups. One sub-group is called Vedic-Puranic, who use the terms such as \"Shiva, Mahadeva, Maheshvara and others\" synonymously, and they use iconography such as the [[Linga]], [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]], [[Trishula]] (trident), as well as anthropomorphic statues of Shiva in temples to help focus their practices.<ref name=\"Michaels2004p215\"/> Another sub-group is called esoteric, which fuses it with abstract ''Sivata'' (feminine energy) or ''Sivatva'' (neuter abstraction), wherein the theology integrates the goddess (Shakti) and the god (Shiva) with Tantra practices and Agama teachings. There is a considerable overlap between these Shaivas and the Shakta Hindus.<ref name=\"Michaels2004p215\">{{cite book|author=Axel Michaels|title=Hinduism: Past and Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jID3TuoiOMQC|year=2004|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-08952-3|pages=215\u2013217|access-date=12 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205003241/https://books.google.com/books?id=jID3TuoiOMQC|archive-date=5 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Vedic, Puranik, and esoteric Shaivism===\nScholars such as Alexis Sanderson discuss Shaivism in three categories: Vedic, Puranik and non-Puranik (esoteric, tantric).{{sfn| Sanderson|1988|pp=660-704}}{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=206\u2013207}} They place Vedic and Puranik together given the significant overlap, while placing Non-Puranik esoteric sub-traditions as a separate category.{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=206\u2013207}}\n\n[[File:Female Ascetics (Yoginis) LACMA M.2011.156.4 (1 of 2).jpg|thumb|Two female Shaiva ascetics (18th century painting)]]\n* ''Vedic-Puranik''. The majority within Shaivism follow the Vedic-Puranik traditions. They revere the Vedas, the Puranas and have beliefs that span dualistic theism style Shiva [[Bhakti]] (devotionalism) to monistic non-theism dedicated to yoga and meditative lifestyle sometimes with renouncing householder life for monastic pursuits of spirituality.{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=205\u2013207, 215\u2013221}} The Yoga practice is particularly pronounced in nondualistic Shaivism, with the practice refined into a methodology such as four-fold ''upaya'': being pathless (anupaya, iccha-less, desire-less), being divine (sambhavopaya, ''jnana'', knowledge-full), being energy (saktopaya, ''kriya'', action-full) and being individual (anavopaya).{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=221\u2013223}}{{refn|group=note|There is an overlap in this approach with those found in non-puranik tantric rituals.{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=221\u2013223}}}}\n* ''Non-Puranik''. These are esoteric, minority sub-traditions wherein devotees are initiated (''{{IAST|d\u012bk\u1e63a}}'') into a specific cult they prefer. Their goals vary, ranging from liberation in current life (''mukti'') to seeking pleasures in higher worlds (''bhukti''). Their means also vary, ranging from meditative ''atimarga'' or \"outer higher path\" versus those whose means are recitation-driven ''mantras''. The ''atimarga'' sub-traditions include Pashupatas and Lakula. According to Sanderson, the Pashupatas{{refn|group=note|Pashupatas have both Vedic-Puranik and non-Puranik sub-traditions.{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=206\u2013207}}}} have the oldest heritage, likely from the 2nd century CE, as evidenced by ancient Hindu texts such as the [[Shanti Parva]] book of the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' epic.{{sfn| Sanderson|1988|pp=660\u2013704}}{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=206\u2013207}} The tantric sub-tradition in this category is traceable to post-8th to post-11th century depending on the region of Indian subcontinent, paralleling the development of Buddhist and Jain tantra traditions in this period.{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=208\u2013209}} Among these are the dualistic Saiva Siddhanta and Bhairava Shaivas (non-Saiddhantika), based on whether they recognize any value in Vedic orthopraxy.{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=210\u2013213}} These sub-traditions cherish secrecy, special symbolic formulae, initiation by a teacher and the pursuit of ''siddhi'' (special powers). Some of these traditions also incorporate theistic ideas, elaborate geometric yantra with embedded spiritual meaning, mantras and rituals.{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=208\u2013209}}{{sfn| Sanderson|1988|pp=660\u2013663, 681\u2013690}}{{sfn| Sanderson|1988|pp=17\u201318}}\n\n===Shaivism versus other Hindu traditions===\n\nShaivism sub-traditions subscribe to various philosophies, are similar in some aspects and differ in others.

They range from dualistic devotional theism to monistic meditative discovery of Shiva within oneself. Within each of these theologies, there are two sub-groups. One sub-group is called Vedic-Puranic, who use the terms such as \"Shiva, Mahadeva, Maheshvara and others\" synonymously, and they use iconography such as the [[Linga]], [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]], [[Trishula]] (trident), as well as anthropomorphic statues of Shiva in temples to help focus their practices.<ref name=\"Michaels2004p215\"/> Another sub-group is called esoteric, which fuses it with abstract ''Sivata'' (feminine energy) or ''Sivatva'' (neuter abstraction), wherein the theology integrates the goddess (Shakti) and the god (Shiva) with Tantra practices and Agama teachings. There is a considerable overlap between these Shaivas and the Shakta Hindus.<ref name=\"Michaels2004p215\">{{cite book|author=Axel Michaels|title=Hinduism: Past and Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jID3TuoiOMQC|year=2004|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-08952-3|pages=215\u2013217|access-date=12 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205003241/https://books.google.com/books?id=jID3TuoiOMQC|archive-date=5 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Vedic, Puranik, and esoteric Shaivism===\nScholars such as Alexis Sanderson discuss Shaivism in three categories: Vedic, Puranik and non-Puranik (esoteric, tantric).{{sfn| Sanderson|1988|pp=660-704}}{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=206\u2013207}} They place Vedic and Puranik together given the significant overlap, while placing Non-Puranik esoteric sub-traditions as a separate category.{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=206\u2013207}}\n\n[[File:Female Ascetics (Yoginis) LACMA M.2011.156.4 (1 of 2).jpg|thumb|Two female Shaiva ascetics (18th century painting)]]\n* ''Vedic-Puranik''. The majority within Shaivism follow the Vedic-Puranik traditions. They revere the Vedas, the Puranas and have beliefs that span dualistic theism style Shiva [[Bhakti]] (devotionalism) to monistic non-theism dedicated to yoga and meditative lifestyle sometimes with renouncing householder life for monastic pursuits of spirituality.{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=205\u2013207, 215\u2013221}} The Yoga practice is particularly pronounced in nondualistic Shaivism, with the practice refined into a methodology such as four-fold ''upaya'': being pathless (anupaya, iccha-less, desire-less), being divine (sambhavopaya, ''jnana'', knowledge-full), being energy (saktopaya, ''kriya'', action-full) and being individual (anavopaya).{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=221\u2013223}}{{refn|group=note|There is an overlap in this approach with those found in non-puranik tantric rituals.{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=221\u2013223}}}}\n* ''Non-Puranik''. These are esoteric, minority sub-traditions wherein devotees are initiated (''{{IAST|d\u012bk\u1e63a}}'') into a specific cult they prefer. Their goals vary, ranging from liberation in current life (''mukti'') to seeking pleasures in higher worlds (''bhukti''). Their means also vary, ranging from meditative ''atimarga'' or \"outer higher path\" versus those whose means are recitation-driven ''mantras''. The ''atimarga'' sub-traditions include Pashupatas and Lakula. According to Sanderson, the Pashupatas{{refn|group=note|Pashupatas have both Vedic-Puranik and non-Puranik sub-traditions.{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=206\u2013207}}}} have the oldest heritage, likely from the 2nd century CE, as evidenced by ancient Hindu texts such as the [[Shanti Parva]] book of the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' epic.{{sfn| Sanderson|1988|pp=660\u2013704}}{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=206\u2013207}} The tantric sub-tradition in this category is traceable to post-8th to post-11th century depending on the region of Indian subcontinent, paralleling the development of Buddhist and Jain tantra traditions in this period.{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=208\u2013209}} Among these are the dualistic Saiva Siddhanta and Bhairava Shaivas (non-Saiddhantika), based on whether they recognize any value in Vedic orthopraxy.{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=210\u2013213}} These sub-traditions cherish secrecy, special symbolic formulae, initiation by a teacher and the pursuit of ''siddhi'' (special powers). Some of these traditions also incorporate theistic ideas, elaborate geometric yantra with embedded spiritual meaning, mantras and rituals.{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=208\u2013209}}{{sfn| Sanderson|1988|pp=660\u2013663, 681\u2013690}}{{sfn| Sanderson|1988|pp=17\u201318}}\n\n===Shaivism versus other Hindu traditions===\n\nShaivism sub-traditions subscribe to various philosophies, are similar in some aspects and differ in others.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\n[[File:Covid 19 new cases and deaths China showing Hubei lockdown.png|thumb|325px|Semi-log graph of new cases and deaths in China during Covid-19 epidemic showing the lockdown and lifting]]\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\n[[File:Covid 19 new cases and deaths China showing Hubei lockdown.png|thumb|325px|Semi-log graph of new cases and deaths in China during Covid-19 epidemic showing the lockdown and lifting]]\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

This principle of overlap, rather than separation of religion and state in India was further recognised in a series of constitutional amendments starting with Article 290 in 1956, to the addition of word \u2018secular\u2019 to the Preamble of Indian Constitution in 1975.{{sfn|Larson|2001}}{{sfn|Rajagopalan|2003}}\n\n[[File:Manmohan Singh at the inauguration of the newly established National Waqf Development Corporation (NAWADCO) Ltd., in New Delhi.

This state intervention while resonant with the dictates of each religion, are unequal and conflicting. For example, a 1951 Religious and Charitable Endowment Indian law allows state governments to forcibly take over, own and operate Hindu temples,<ref>KN Kumari (1998), History of the Hindu Religious Endowments in Andhra Pradesh, Northern Books, {{ISBN|978-8172110857}}</ref> and collect revenue from offerings and redistribute that revenue to any non-temple purposes including maintenance of religious institutions opposed to the temple;<ref>Presler, F. A. (1983). The structure and consequences of temple policy in Tamil Nadu, 1967-81. Pacific Affairs, 56(2), 232-246</ref> Indian law also allows Islamic religious schools to receive partial financial support from state and central government of India, to offer religious indoctrination, if the school agrees that the student has an option to opt out from religious indoctrination if he or she so asks, and that the school will not discriminate any student based on religion, race or other grounds. Educational institutions wholly owned and operated by government may not impart religious indoctrination, but religious sects and endowments may open their own school, impart religious indoctrination and have a right to partial state financial assistance.{{sfn|Rajagopalan|2003}}\n\nIn matters of personal law, such as acceptable age of marriage for girls, female circumcision, polygamy, divorce and inheritance, Indian law permits each religious group to implement their religious law if the religion so dictates, otherwise the state laws apply. In terms of religions of India with significant populations, only Islam has religious laws in form of sharia which India allows as Muslim Personal Law.<ref name=jenkins/>\n\nSecularism in India, thus, does not mean the separation of religion from state. Instead, secularism in India means a state that supports or participates in a neutral manner in the affairs of all religious groups. Religious laws in personal domain, particularly for Muslim Indians, supersede parliamentary laws in India; and currently, in some situations such as religious indoctrination schools the state partially finances certain religious schools. These differences have led a number of scholars<ref name=ddace/><ref name=madan>Madan, T. N.

The attempt to have a Uniform Civil Code has long been discussed as a means to realize a secular Indian state.<ref name=ddace/><ref name=madan/> The overlap between religion and state has created tension between supporters of Indian form of secularism and the supporters of Hindu nationalism.

Everyone is equal under law, and subject to the same laws irrespective of his or her religion, in the West.{{sfn|Smith|2011|pp=3-8}}\n\nIn contrast, in India, the word secular does not mean a \"thorough-going separation of religion and state\" states Donald Smith.{{sfn|Smith|2011|pp=126\u2013128}} However, some separation exists. According to the Constitution of India, states Smith, there is no official state religion in India, schools that are wholly owned by the state can not mandate religious instruction (Article 28), and there can be no taxes to support any particular religion (Article 27).{{sfn|Smith|2011|pp=126\u2013132}} Overlap is permitted, whereby institutions that are not entirely financed by the state can mandate religious instruction, and state can provide financial aid to maintain and construct religious buildings or infrastructure.{{sfn|Smith|2011|pp=126\u2013133}} Furthermore, India's constitutional framework allows \"extensive state interference in religious affairs\".{{sfn|Smith|2011|pp=133\u2013134}}\n\nAccording to R.A.

The Indian structure has created incentives for various religious denominations to start and maintain schools, impart religious education, and receive partial but significant financial support from the Indian government. Similarly, the Indian government has established statutory institutions to regulate and financially administer the Islamic [[Central Wakf Council]], historic [[Hindu temple]]s, Buddhist monasteries, and certain Christian religious institutions; this direct Indian government involvement in various religions is markedly different from Western secularism.<ref name=ddace>DD Acevedo (2013), Secularism in the Indian Context, Law & Social Inquiry, Volume 38, Issue 1, pp 138\u2013167, {{doi|10.1111/j.1747-4469.2012.01304.x}}</ref><ref>Gary Jacobsohn, The Wheel of Law: India\u2019s Secularism in Comparative Constitutional Context, Princeton University Press, 2005</ref> According to Ashis Nandy, a better term for \"Indian secularism\" would be \"religious tolerance\", rather than importing and redefining the Western concept of secularism.<ref>Nandy A, [https://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/a-billion-gandhis/224252 A Billion Gandhis], Outlook India, 21 June 2004</ref>\n\n==Issues==\nIndian concept of secularism, where religious laws supersede state laws and the state is expected to even-handedly involve itself in religion, is a controversial subject.{{sfn|Larson|2001}}<ref name=\"duncan\">Craig Duncan, [http://www.ithaca.edu/faculty/cduncan/340/shahbano.doc Shah Bano: The Dilemma of Religious Liberty and Sex Equality], Cornell University, Ithaca, 2009</ref><ref name=madan/> Any attempts and demand by the Indian populace to a uniform civil code is considered a threat to right to religious personal laws by Indian Muslims.{{sfn|Rajagopalan|2003}}<ref name=intoday/>\n\n===Shah Bano case===\n{{Main|Mohd.

Along with alimony, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of India wrote in his opinion just how unfairly Islamic personal laws treated women and thus how necessary it was for the nation to adopt a Uniform Civil Code. The Chief Justice further ruled that no authoritative text of Islam forbade the payment of regular maintenance to ex-wives.<ref name=duncan/><ref name=\"jenkins\">Laura Jenkins, [http://homepages.uc.edu/thro/shahbano/allshahbano.htm Shah Bano: Muslim Women\u2019s Rights], University of Cincinnati, Ohio (2000)</ref>\n\nThe Shah Bano ruling immediately triggered a controversy and mass demonstrations by Muslim men.

Indian Muslims consider the new 1986 law, which selectively exempts them from maintenance payment to ex-wife because of their religion, as secular because it respects Muslim men's religious rights and recognises that they are culturally different from Indian men and women of other religions.

The idea here in its weaker publicly reiterated form was that the government would not interfere in 'personal' religious matters and would create circumstances in which people of all religions could live in harmony. The idea in its stronger, unofficially stated form was that in order to modernise, India would have to set aside centuries of traditional religious ignorance and superstition and eventually eliminate Hinduism and Islam from people's lives altogether.

Rather what is needed is to make sure that in so far as the state has to deal with different religions and members of different religious communities, there must be a basic symmetry of treatment.<ref name=mm2013/> Sen does not claim that modern India is symmetric in its treatment or offer any views of whether acceptance of [[sharia]] in matters such as child marriage is equivalent to having a neutral attitude towards a religion.

It also set the precedent that religious law, such as sharia, can overlap and supersede [[common law|common]] and [[Civil law (common law)|civil laws]], that elected legislators may not revise or enact laws that supersede religious laws, that people of one nation need not live under the same laws, and that law enforcement process for different individuals shall depend on their religion.{{sfn|Smith|2011}}{{sfn|Larson|2001}} The Indian Muslim Personal Law ([[Sharia]]t) Application Act of 1937 continues to be the law of land of modern India for Indian Muslims, while parliament-based, non-religious uniform civil code passed in mid-1950s applies to Indians who are Hindus (which includes Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs, Parsees), as well as to Indian Christians and Jews.{{sfn|Larson|2001}}<ref>Chandra Mallampalli, Christians and Public Life in Colonial India: Contending with Marginality (London, 2004)</ref>\n\n==Current status==\nThe 7th schedule of Indian constitution places religious institutions, charities and trusts into so-called Concurrent List, which means that both the central government of India, and various state governments in India can make their own laws about religious institutions, charities and trusts.

This principle of overlap, rather than separation of religion and state in India was further recognised in a series of constitutional amendments starting with Article 290 in 1956, to the addition of word \u2018secular\u2019 to the Preamble of Indian Constitution in 1975.{{sfn|Larson|2001}}{{sfn|Rajagopalan|2003}}\n\n[[File:Manmohan Singh at the inauguration of the newly established National Waqf Development Corporation (NAWADCO) Ltd., in New Delhi.

This state intervention while resonant with the dictates of each religion, are unequal and conflicting. For example, a 1951 Religious and Charitable Endowment Indian law allows state governments to forcibly take over, own and operate Hindu temples,<ref>KN Kumari (1998), History of the Hindu Religious Endowments in Andhra Pradesh, Northern Books, {{ISBN|978-8172110857}}</ref> and collect revenue from offerings and redistribute that revenue to any non-temple purposes including maintenance of religious institutions opposed to the temple;<ref>Presler, F. A. (1983). The structure and consequences of temple policy in Tamil Nadu, 1967-81. Pacific Affairs, 56(2), 232-246</ref> Indian law also allows Islamic religious schools to receive partial financial support from state and central government of India, to offer religious indoctrination, if the school agrees that the student has an option to opt out from religious indoctrination if he or she so asks, and that the school will not discriminate any student based on religion, race or other grounds. Educational institutions wholly owned and operated by government may not impart religious indoctrination, but religious sects and endowments may open their own school, impart religious indoctrination and have a right to partial state financial assistance.{{sfn|Rajagopalan|2003}}\n\nIn matters of personal law, such as acceptable age of marriage for girls, female circumcision, polygamy, divorce and inheritance, Indian law permits each religious group to implement their religious law if the religion so dictates, otherwise the state laws apply. In terms of religions of India with significant populations, only Islam has religious laws in form of sharia which India allows as Muslim Personal Law.<ref name=jenkins/>\n\nSecularism in India, thus, does not mean the separation of religion from state. Instead, secularism in India means a state that supports or participates in a neutral manner in the affairs of all religious groups. Religious laws in personal domain, particularly for Muslim Indians, supersede parliamentary laws in India; and currently, in some situations such as religious indoctrination schools the state partially finances certain religious schools.

Everyone is equal under law, and subject to the same laws irrespective of his or her religion, in the West.{{sfn|Smith|2011|pp=3-8}}\n\nIn contrast, in India, the word secular does not mean a \"thorough-going separation of religion and state\" states Donald Smith.{{sfn|Smith|2011|pp=126\u2013128}} However, some separation exists. According to the Constitution of India, states Smith, there is no official state religion in India, schools that are wholly owned by the state can not mandate religious instruction (Article 28), and there can be no taxes to support any particular religion (Article 27).{{sfn|Smith|2011|pp=126\u2013132}} Overlap is permitted, whereby institutions that are not entirely financed by the state can mandate religious instruction, and state can provide financial aid to maintain and construct religious buildings or infrastructure.{{sfn|Smith|2011|pp=126\u2013133}} Furthermore, India's constitutional framework allows \"extensive state interference in religious affairs\".{{sfn|Smith|2011|pp=133\u2013134}}\n\nAccording to R.A.

The Indian structure has created incentives for various religious denominations to start and maintain schools, impart religious education, and receive partial but significant financial support from the Indian government. Similarly, the Indian government has established statutory institutions to regulate and financially administer the Islamic [[Central Wakf Council]], historic [[Hindu temple]]s, Buddhist monasteries, and certain Christian religious institutions; this direct Indian government involvement in various religions is markedly different from Western secularism.<ref name=ddace>DD Acevedo (2013), Secularism in the Indian Context, Law & Social Inquiry, Volume 38, Issue 1, pp 138\u2013167, {{doi|10.1111/j.1747-4469.2012.01304.x}}</ref><ref>Gary Jacobsohn, The Wheel of Law: India\u2019s Secularism in Comparative Constitutional Context, Princeton University Press, 2005</ref> According to Ashis Nandy, a better term for \"Indian secularism\" would be \"religious tolerance\", rather than importing and redefining the Western concept of secularism.<ref>Nandy A, [https://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/a-billion-gandhis/224252 A Billion Gandhis], Outlook India, 21 June 2004</ref>\n\n==Issues==\nIndian concept of secularism, where religious laws supersede state laws and the state is expected to even-handedly involve itself in religion, is a controversial subject.{{sfn|Larson|2001}}<ref name=\"duncan\">Craig Duncan, [http://www.ithaca.edu/faculty/cduncan/340/shahbano.doc Shah Bano: The Dilemma of Religious Liberty and Sex Equality], Cornell University, Ithaca, 2009</ref><ref name=madan/> Any attempts and demand by the Indian populace to a uniform civil code is considered a threat to right to religious personal laws by Indian Muslims.{{sfn|Rajagopalan|2003}}<ref name=intoday/>\n\n===Shah Bano case===\n{{Main|Mohd.

The Chief Justice further ruled that no authoritative text of Islam forbade the payment of regular maintenance to ex-wives.<ref name=duncan/><ref name=\"jenkins\">Laura Jenkins, [http://homepages.uc.edu/thro/shahbano/allshahbano.htm Shah Bano: Muslim Women\u2019s Rights], University of Cincinnati, Ohio (2000)</ref>\n\nThe Shah Bano ruling immediately triggered a controversy and mass demonstrations by Muslim men.

Indian Muslims consider the new 1986 law, which selectively exempts them from maintenance payment to ex-wife because of their religion, as secular because it respects Muslim men's religious rights and recognises that they are culturally different from Indian men and women of other religions.

The idea here in its weaker publicly reiterated form was that the government would not interfere in 'personal' religious matters and would create circumstances in which people of all religions could live in harmony. The idea in its stronger, unofficially stated form was that in order to modernise, India would have to set aside centuries of traditional religious ignorance and superstition and eventually eliminate Hinduism and Islam from people's lives altogether. After [[Partition of India|Independence]], governments implemented secularism mostly by refusing to recognise the religious pasts of [[Indian nationalism]], whether Hindu or Muslim, and at the same time (inconsistently) by retaining [[Sharia|Muslim 'personal law']] .<ref name=\"Inden\"/>}}\n\n[[Amartya Sen]], the Indian Nobel Laureate, suggests<ref>Amartya Sen (2006), The Argumentative Indian: Writings on Indian History, Culture and Identity; {{ISBN|978-0312426026}}; Picador</ref> that secularism in the political \u2013 as opposed to ecclesiastical \u2013 sense requires the separation of the state from any particular religious order. This, claims Sen, can be interpreted in at least two different ways: \"The first view argues the state be equidistant from all religions \u2013 refusing to take sides and having a neutral attitude towards them. The second view insists that the state must not have any relation at all with any religion\", quotes Minhaz Merchant.<ref name=mm2013/> In both interpretations, secularism goes against giving any religion a privileged position in the activities of the state. Sen argues that the first form is more suited to India, where there is no demand that the state stay clear of any association with any religious matter whatsoever. Rather what is needed is to make sure that in so far as the state has to deal with different religions and members of different religious communities, there must be a basic symmetry of treatment.<ref name=mm2013/> Sen does not claim that modern India is symmetric in its treatment or offer any views of whether acceptance of [[sharia]] in matters such as child marriage is equivalent to having a neutral attitude towards a religion. Critics of Sen claim that secularism, as practised in India, is not the secularism of first or second variety Sen enumerates.<ref name=mm2013>Minhaz Merchant, Amartya Sen and the ayatollahs of secularism \u2013 part 3, ''The Times of India'', [https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/headon/amartya-sen-and-the-ayatollahs-of-secularism-part-3/ 24 July 2013]</ref>\n\nAuthor [[Taslima Nasreen]] sees Indian secularists as pseudo secularist, accusing them of being biased towards Muslims saying, \"Most secular people are pro-Muslims and anti-Hindu.

{"title_page": "Data compression", "text_new": "{{redirect|Source coding|the term in computer programming|Source code}}\n{{short description|Process of encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation}}\n\nIn [[signal processing]], '''data compression''', '''source coding''',<ref name=\"Wade\"/> or '''bit-rate reduction''' is the process of encoding [[information]] using fewer [[bit]]s than the original representation.<ref name=\"mahdi53\"/> Any particular compression is either [[Lossy compression|lossy]] or [[Lossless compression|lossless]]. Lossless compression reduces bits by identifying and eliminating [[Redundancy (information theory)|statistical redundancy]]. No information is lost in lossless compression. Lossy compression reduces bits by removing unnecessary or less important information.<ref name=\"PujarKadlaskar\"/> Typically, a device that performs data compression is referred to as an encoder, and one that performs the reversal of the process (decompression) as a decoder.\n\nThe process of reducing the size of a [[data file]] is often referred to as data compression. In the context of [[data transmission]], it is called source coding; encoding done at the source of the data before it is stored or transmitted.<ref name=\"Salomon\"/> Source coding should not be confused with [[channel coding]], for error detection and correction or [[line coding]], the means for mapping data onto a signal.\n\nCompression is useful because it reduces resources required to store and transmit data. [[Computational resource]]s are consumed in the compression and decompression processes. Data compression is subject to a [[Space\u2013time tradeoff|space\u2013time complexity trade-off]]. For instance, [[#video|a compression scheme for video]] may require expensive [[Electronic hardware|hardware]] for the video to be decompressed fast enough to be viewed as it is being decompressed, and the option to decompress the video in full before watching it may be inconvenient or require additional storage. The design of data compression schemes involves trade-offs among various factors, including the degree of compression, the amount of distortion introduced (when using [[lossy data compression]]), and the computational resources required to compress and decompress the data.<ref name=\"MittalVetter\"/><ref name=\"Tank\"/> tatti\n\n== Lossless ==\n{{Main|Lossless compression}}\n\n[[Lossless data compression]] [[algorithm]]s usually exploit [[Redundancy (information theory)|statistical redundancy]] to represent data without losing any [[Self-information|information]], so that the process is reversible. Lossless compression is possible because most real-world data exhibits statistical redundancy. For example, an image may have areas of color that do not change over several pixels; instead of coding \"red pixel, red pixel, ...\" the data may be encoded as \"279 red pixels\". This is a basic example of [[run-length encoding]]; there are many schemes to reduce file size by eliminating redundancy.\n\nThe [[Lempel\u2013Ziv]] (LZ) compression methods are among the most popular algorithms for lossless storage.<ref name=\"Optimized LZW\"/>  [[DEFLATE]] is a variation on LZ optimized for decompression speed and compression ratio, but compression can be slow. In the mid-1980s, following work by [[Terry Welch]], the [[Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Welch]] (LZW) algorithm rapidly became the method of choice for most general-purpose compression systems. LZW is used in [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]] images, programs such as PKZIP, and hardware devices such as modems.<ref name=\"Wolfram\"/> LZ methods use a table-based compression model where table entries are substituted for repeated strings of data. For most LZ methods, this table is generated dynamically from earlier data in the input. The table itself is often [[Huffman coding|Huffman encoded]]. [[Grammar-based codes]] like this can compress highly repetitive input extremely effectively, for instance, a biological data collection of the same or closely related species, a huge versioned document collection, internet archival, etc. The basic task of grammar-based codes is constructing a context-free grammar deriving a single string. Other practical grammar compression algorithms include [[Sequitur algorithm|Sequitur]] and Re-Pair.\n\nThe strongest modern lossless compressors use [[Randomized algorithm|probabilistic]] models, such as [[prediction by partial matching]]. The [[Burrows\u2013Wheeler transform]] can also be viewed as an indirect form of statistical modelling.<ref name=\"mahmud2\"/> In a further refinement of the direct use of [[probabilistic model]]ling, statistical estimates can be coupled to an algorithm called [[arithmetic coding]]. Arithmetic coding is a more modern coding technique that uses the mathematical calculations of a [[finite-state machine]] to produce a string of encoded bits from a series of input data symbols. It can achieve superior compression compared to other techniques such as the better-known Huffman algorithm. It uses an internal memory state to avoid the need to perform a one-to-one mapping of individual input symbols to distinct representations that use an integer number of bits, and it clears out the internal memory only after encoding the entire string of data symbols. Arithmetic coding applies especially well to adaptive data compression tasks where the statistics vary and are context-dependent, as it can be easily coupled with an adaptive model of the [[probability distribution]] of the input data. An early example of the use of arithmetic coding was in an optional (but not widely used) feature of the [[JPEG]] image coding standard.<ref name=TomLane/> It has since been applied in various other designs including [[H.263]], [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC]] and [[HEVC]] for video coding.<ref name=\"HEVC\"/>\n\n== Lossy ==\n{{Main|Lossy compression}}\n\nIn the late 1980s, digital images became more common, and standards for lossless [[image compression]] emerged. In the early 1990s, lossy compression methods began to be widely used.<ref name=\"Wolfram\"/> In these schemes, some loss of information is accepted as dropping nonessential detail can save storage space. There is a corresponding [[trade-off]] between preserving information and reducing size. Lossy data compression schemes are designed by research on how people perceive the data in question. For example, the human eye is more sensitive to subtle variations in [[luminance]] than it is to the variations in color. [[JPEG]] image compression works in part by rounding off nonessential bits of information.<ref name=\"Arcangel\"/>  A number of popular compression formats exploit these perceptual differences, including [[psychoacoustics]] for sound, and [[psychovisual]]s for images and video.\n\nMost forms of lossy compression are based on [[transform coding]], especially the [[discrete cosine transform]] (DCT). It was first proposed in 1972 by [[N. Ahmed|Nasir Ahmed]], who then developed a working algorithm with T. Natarajan and [[K. R. Rao]] in 1973, before introducing it in January 1974.<ref name=\"Ahmed\">{{cite journal |last=Ahmed |first=Nasir |author-link=N. Ahmed |title=How I Came Up With the Discrete Cosine Transform |journal=[[Digital Signal Processing (journal)|Digital Signal Processing]] |date=January 1991 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=4\u20135 |doi=10.1016/1051-2004(91)90086-Z |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/52879771/DCT-History-How-I-Came-Up-with-the-Discrete-Cosine-Transform}}</ref><ref name=\"DCT\"/> DCT is the most widely used lossy compression method, and is used in multimedia formats for [[Image compression|images]] (such as [[JPEG]] and [[HEIF]]),<ref name=\"JPEG\"/> [[Video compression|video]] (such as [[MPEG]], [[H.264/AVC|AVC]] and [[HEVC]]) and audio (such as [[MP3]], [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] and [[Vorbis]]).\n\nLossy [[image compression]] is used in [[digital camera]]s, to increase storage capacities. Similarly, [[DVD]]s, [[Blu-ray]] and [[streaming video]] use the lossy [[video coding format]].\n\nIn lossy audio compression, methods of psychoacoustics are used to remove non-audible (or less audible) components of the [[audio signal]]. Compression of human speech is often performed with even more specialized techniques; [[speech coding]] is distinguished as a separate discipline from general-purpose audio compression. Speech coding is used in [[internet telephony]], for example, audio compression is used for CD ripping and is decoded by the audio players.<ref name=\"mahmud2\"/>\n\n== Theory ==\nThe theoretical basis for compression is provided by [[information theory]] and, more specifically, [[algorithmic information theory]] for lossless compression and [[rate\u2013distortion theory]] for lossy compression. These areas of study were essentially created by [[Claude Shannon]], who published fundamental papers on the topic in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Other topics associated with compression include [[coding theory]] and [[statistical inference]].<ref name=\"Marak\"/>\n\n=== Machine learning ===\nThere is a close connection between [[machine learning]] and compression. A system that predicts the [[posterior probabilities]] of a sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data compression (by using [[arithmetic coding]] on the output distribution). An optimal compressor can be used for prediction (by finding the symbol that compresses best, given the previous history). This equivalence has been used as a justification for using data compression as a benchmark for \"general intelligence\".<ref name=\"Mahoney\"/><ref name=\"Market Efficiency\"/><ref name=\"Ben-Gal\"/>\n\nAn alternative view can show compression algorithms implicitly map strings into implicit [[feature space vector]]s, and compression-based similarity measures compute similarity within these feature spaces. For each compressor C(.) we define an associated vector space \u2135, such that C(.) maps an input string x, corresponds to the vector norm ||~x||. An exhaustive examination of the feature spaces underlying all compression algorithms is precluded by space; instead, feature vectors chooses to examine three representative lossless compression methods, LZW, LZ77, and PPM.<ref name=\"ScullyBrodley\"/>\n\n=== Data differencing ===\n{{main|Data differencing}}\nData compression can be viewed as a special case of [[data differencing]].<ref name=\"RFC 3284\"/><ref name=\"Vdelta\"/> Data differencing consists of producing a ''difference'' given a ''source'' and a ''target,'' with patching reproducing the ''target'' given a ''source'' and a ''difference.'' Since there is no separate source and target in data compression, one can consider data compression as data differencing with empty source data, the compressed file corresponding to a difference from nothing. This is the same as considering absolute [[entropy (information theory)|entropy]] (corresponding to data compression) as a special case of [[relative entropy]] (corresponding to data differencing) with no initial data.\n\nThe term ''differential compression'' is used to emphasize the data differencing connection.\n\n== Uses ==\n=== Image ===\n{{Main|Image compression}}\n\n[[Entropy coding]] originated in the 1940s with the introduction of [[Shannon\u2013Fano coding]],<ref name=\"Shannon\"/> the basis for [[Huffman coding]] which was developed in 1950.<ref name=\"Huffman\"/> [[Transform coding]] dates back to the late 1960s, with the introduction of [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT) coding in 1968 and the [[Hadamard transform]] in 1969.<ref name=\"Hadamard\"/>\n\nAn important [[image compression]] technique is the [[discrete cosine transform]] (DCT), a technique developed in the early 1970s.<ref name=\"Ahmed\"/> DCT is the basis for [[JPEG]], a [[lossy compression]] format which was introduced by the [[Joint Photographic Experts Group]] (JPEG) in 1992.<ref name=\"t81\">{{cite web |title=T.81 \u2013 DIGITAL COMPRESSION AND CODING OF CONTINUOUS-TONE STILL IMAGES \u2013 REQUIREMENTS AND GUIDELINES |url=https://www.w3.org/Graphics/JPEG/itu-t81.pdf |publisher=[[CCITT]] |date=September 1992 |accessdate=12 July 2019}}</ref> JPEG greatly reduces the amount of data required to represent an image at the cost of a relatively small reduction in image quality and has become the most widely used [[image file format]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The JPEG image format explained |url=https://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/photography/what-is-a-jpeg-11364206889349 |website=[[BT.com]] |publisher=[[BT Group]] |accessdate=5 August 2019 |date=31 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Baraniuk |first1=Chris |title=Copy protections could come to JPEGs |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-34538705 |accessdate=13 September 2019 |work=[[BBC News]] |agency=[[BBC]] |date=15 October 2015}}</ref> Its highly efficient DCT-based compression algorithm was largely responsible for the wide proliferation of [[digital images]] and [[digital photo]]s.<ref name=\"Atlantic\">{{cite web |title=What Is a JPEG?

[[List of codecs#Audio|Audio compression algorithms]] are implemented in [[software]] as audio [[codec]]s. Lossy audio compression algorithms provide higher compression at the cost of fidelity and are used in numerous audio applications. These algorithms almost all rely on [[psychoacoustics]] to eliminate or reduce fidelity of less audible sounds, thereby reducing the space required to store or transmit them.<ref name=\"mahdi53\"/>\n\nIn both lossy and lossless compression, [[Redundancy (information theory)|information redundancy]] is reduced, using methods such as [[Coding theory|coding]], [[pattern recognition]], and [[linear prediction]] to reduce the amount of information used to represent the uncompressed data.\n\nThe acceptable trade-off between loss of audio quality and transmission or storage size depends upon the application. For example, one 640 MB [[compact disc]] (CD) holds approximately one hour of uncompressed [[high fidelity]] music, less than 2 hours of music compressed losslessly, or 7 hours of music compressed in the [[MP3]] format at a medium [[bit rate]]. A digital sound recorder can typically store around 200 hours of clearly intelligible speech in 640 MB.<ref name=\"Olympus WS-120\"/>\n\nLossless audio compression produces a representation of digital data that decompress to an exact digital duplicate of the original audio stream, unlike playback from lossy compression techniques such as [[Vorbis]] and [[MP3]]. Compression ratios are around 50\u201360% of original size,<ref name=\"FLAC\"/> which is similar to those for generic lossless data compression. Lossless compression is unable to attain high compression ratios due to the complexity of [[waveform]]s and the rapid changes in sound forms. Codecs like [[FLAC]], [[Shorten (file format)|Shorten]], and [[TTA (codec)|TTA]] use [[linear prediction]] to estimate the spectrum of the signal. Many of these algorithms use [[convolution]] with the filter [-1 1] to slightly [[white noise|whiten]] or [[decorrelation|flatten]] the spectrum, thereby allowing traditional lossless compression to work more efficiently. The process is reversed upon decompression.\n\nWhen audio files are to be processed, either by further compression or for [[Audio editing|editing]], it is desirable to work from an unchanged original (uncompressed or losslessly compressed). Processing of a lossily compressed file for some purpose usually produces a final result inferior to the creation of the same compressed file from an uncompressed original. In addition to sound editing or mixing, lossless audio compression is often used for archival storage, or as master copies.\n\nA number of lossless audio compression formats exist. [[Shorten (file format)|Shorten]] was an early lossless format. Newer ones include [[Free Lossless Audio Codec]] (FLAC), Apple's [[Apple Lossless]] (ALAC), [[MPEG-4 ALS]], Microsoft's [[Windows Media Audio 9 Lossless]] (WMA Lossless), [[Monkey's Audio]], [[TTA (codec)|TTA]], and [[WavPack]]. See [[List of codecs#Lossless data compression|list of lossless codecs]] for a complete listing.\n\nSome [[audio file format|audio formats]] feature a combination of a lossy format and a lossless correction; this allows stripping the correction to easily obtain a lossy file. Such formats include [[MPEG-4 SLS]] (Scalable to Lossless), [[WavPack]], and [[OptimFROG DualStream]].\n\nOther formats are associated with a distinct system, such as:\n* [[Direct Stream Transfer]], used in [[Super Audio CD]]\n* [[Meridian Lossless Packing]], used in [[DVD-Audio]], [[Dolby TrueHD]], [[Blu-ray]] and [[HD DVD]]\n\n==== Lossy audio compression ====\n[[File:AudiodatenkompressionManowarThePowerOfThySword.jpg|thumb|Comparison of [[spectrogram]]s of audio in an uncompressed format and several lossy formats. The lossy spectrograms show [[bandlimiting]] of higher frequencies, a common technique associated with lossy audio compression.]]\n\nLossy audio compression is used in a wide range of applications. In addition to the direct applications (MP3 players or computers), digitally compressed audio streams are used in most video DVDs, digital television, streaming media on the [[internet]], satellite and cable radio, and increasingly in terrestrial radio broadcasts. Lossy compression typically achieves far greater compression than lossless compression (5\u201320% of the original size, rather than 50\u201360%), by discarding less-critical data.<ref name=\"Jaiswal\"/>\n\nThe innovation of lossy audio compression was to use [[psychoacoustics]] to recognize that not all data in an audio stream can be perceived by the human [[auditory system]]. Most lossy compression reduces perceptual redundancy by first identifying perceptually irrelevant sounds, that is, sounds that are very hard to hear. Typical examples include high frequencies or sounds that occur at the same time as louder sounds. Those sounds are coded with decreased accuracy or not at all.\n\nDue to the nature of lossy algorithms, [[audio quality]] suffers when a file is decompressed and recompressed ([[digital generation loss]]). This makes lossy compression unsuitable for storing the intermediate results in professional audio engineering applications, such as sound editing and multitrack recording. However, they are very popular with end users (particularly [[MP3]]) as a megabyte can store about a minute's worth of music at adequate quality.\n\n===== Coding methods =====\nTo determine what information in an audio signal is perceptually irrelevant, most lossy compression algorithms use transforms such as the [[modified discrete cosine transform]] (MDCT) to convert [[time domain]] sampled waveforms into a transform domain. Once transformed, typically into the [[frequency domain]], component frequencies can be allocated bits according to how audible they are. Audibility of spectral components calculated using the [[absolute threshold of hearing]] and the principles of [[simultaneous masking]]\u2014the phenomenon wherein a signal is masked by another signal separated by frequency\u2014and, in some cases, [[temporal masking]]\u2014where a signal is masked by another signal separated by time. [[Equal-loudness contour]]s may also be used to weight the perceptual importance of components. Models of the human ear-brain combination incorporating such effects are often called [[psychoacoustic model]]s.<ref name=\"faxin47\"/>\n\nOther types of lossy compressors, such as the [[linear predictive coding]] (LPC) used with speech, are source-based coders. These coders use a model of the sound's generator (such as the human vocal tract with LPC) to whiten the audio signal (i.e., flatten its spectrum) before [[Quantization (signal processing)|quantization]]. LPC may be thought of as a basic perceptual coding technique: reconstruction of an audio signal using a linear predictor shapes the coder's quantization noise into the spectrum of the target signal, partially masking it.<ref name=\"Jaiswal\"/>\n\nLossy formats are often used for the distribution of streaming audio or interactive applications (such as the coding of speech for digital transmission in cell phone networks). In such applications, the data must be decompressed as the data flows, rather than after the entire data stream has been transmitted. Not all audio codecs can be used for streaming applications, and for such applications a codec designed to stream data effectively will usually be chosen.<ref name=\"Jaiswal\"/>\n\nLatency results from the methods used to encode and decode the data. Some codecs will analyze a longer segment of the data to optimize efficiency, and then code it in a manner that requires a larger segment of data at one time to decode. (Often codecs create segments called a \"frame\" to create discrete data segments for encoding and decoding.) The inherent [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] of the coding algorithm can be critical; for example, when there is a two-way transmission of data, such as with a telephone conversation, significant delays may seriously degrade the perceived quality.\n\nIn contrast to the speed of compression, which is proportional to the number of operations required by the algorithm, here latency refers to the number of samples that must be analysed before a block of audio is processed. In the minimum case, latency is zero samples (e.g., if the coder/decoder simply reduces the number of bits used to quantize the signal). Time domain algorithms such as LPC also often have low latencies, hence their popularity in speech coding for telephony. In algorithms such as MP3, however, a large number of samples have to be analyzed to implement a psychoacoustic model in the frequency domain, and latency is on the order of 23&nbsp;ms (46&nbsp;ms for two-way communication).\n\n===== Speech encoding =====\n[[Speech encoding]] is an important category of audio data compression. The perceptual models used to estimate what a human ear can hear are generally somewhat different from those used for music. The range of frequencies needed to convey the sounds of a human voice are normally far narrower than that needed for music, and the sound is normally less complex. As a result, speech can be encoded at high quality using a relatively low bit rate.\n\nIf the data to be compressed is analog (such as a voltage that varies with time), quantization is employed to digitize it into numbers (normally integers). This is referred to as analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion. If the integers generated by quantization are 8 bits each, then the entire range of the analog signal is divided into 256 intervals and all the signal values within an interval are quantized to the same number. If 16-bit integers are generated, then the range of the analog signal is divided into 65,536 intervals.\n\nThis relation illustrates the compromise between high resolution (a large number of analog intervals) and high compression (small integers generated). This application of quantization is used by several speech compression methods. This is accomplished, in general, by some combination of two approaches:\n* Only encoding sounds that could be made by a single human voice.\n* Throwing away more of the data in the signal\u2014keeping just enough to reconstruct an \"intelligible\" voice rather than the full frequency range of human [[hearing (sense)|hearing]].\n\nPerhaps the earliest algorithms used in speech encoding (and audio data compression in general) were the [[A-law algorithm]] and the [[\u03bc-law algorithm]].\n\n==== History ====\n[[File:Placa-audioPC-925.jpg|right|thumb|Solidyne 922: The world's first commercial audio bit compression [[sound card]] for PC, 1990]]\n\nIn 1950, [[Bell Labs]] filed the patent on [[differential pulse-code modulation]] (DPCM).<ref name=\"DPCM\"/> [[Adaptive DPCM]] (ADPCM) was introduced by P.

Twenty years later, almost all the radio stations in the world were using similar technology manufactured by a number of companies.\n\nA literature compendium for a large variety of audio coding systems was published in the IEEE's ''Journal on Selected Areas in Communications'' (''JSAC''), in February 1988. While there were some papers from before that time, this collection documented an entire variety of finished, working audio coders, nearly all of them using perceptual (i.e. masking) techniques and some kind of frequency analysis and back-end noiseless coding.<ref name=\"Possibilities\"/> Several of these papers remarked on the difficulty of obtaining good, clean digital audio for research purposes. Most, if not all, of the authors in the ''JSAC'' edition were also active in the [[MPEG-1]] Audio committee, which created the MP3 format.\n\n=== Video ===\n{{see also|Video coding format|Video codec}}\nVideo compression is a practical implementation of source coding in information theory. In practice, most video codecs are used alongside audio compression techniques to store the separate but complementary data streams as one combined package using so-called ''[[digital container format|container format]]s''.<ref name=\"CSIP\"/>\n\n[[Uncompressed video]] requires a very high [[Uncompressed video#Storage and Data Rates for Uncompressed Video|data rate]]. Although [[List of codecs#Lossless video compression|lossless video compression]] codecs perform at a compression factor of 5 to 12, a typical [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264]] lossy compression video has a compression factor between 20 and 200.<ref name=\"MSU2007\"/>\n\nThe two key video compression techniques used in [[video coding standards]] are the [[discrete cosine transform]] (DCT) and [[motion compensation]] (MC). Most video coding standards, such as the [[H.26x]] and [[MPEG]] formats, typically use motion-compensated DCT video coding (block motion compensation).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chen |first1=Jie |last2=Koc |first2=Ut-Va |last3=Liu |first3=KJ Ray |title=Design of Digital Video Coding Systems: A Complete Compressed Domain Approach |date=2001 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |isbn=9780203904183 |page=71 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LUzFKU3HeegC&pg=PA71}}</ref><ref name=\"Li\">{{cite book |last1=Li |first1=Jian Ping |title=Proceedings of the International Computer Conference 2006 on Wavelet Active Media Technology and Information Processing: Chongqing, China, 29-31 August 2006 |date=2006 |publisher=[[World Scientific]] |isbn=9789812709998 |page=847 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FZiK3zXdK7sC&pg=PA847}}</ref>\n\n==== Encoding theory ====\nVideo data may be represented as a series of still image frames. Such data usually contains abundant amounts of spatial and temporal [[redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]]. Video compression algorithms attempt to reduce redundancy and store information more compactly.\n\nMost [[video compression formats]] and [[video codec|codecs]] exploit both spatial and temporal redundancy (e.g. through difference coding with [[motion compensation]]). Similarities can be encoded by only storing differences between e.g. temporally adjacent frames (inter-frame coding) or spatially adjacent pixels (intra-frame coding).\n[[inter frame|Inter-frame]] compression (a temporal [[delta encoding]]) is one of the most powerful compression techniques. It (re)uses data from one or more earlier or later frames in a sequence to describe the current frame. [[Intra-frame coding]], on the other hand, uses only data from within the current frame, effectively being still-[[image compression]].<ref name=\"faxin47\"/>\n\nA [[Video coding format#Intra-frame video coding formats|class of specialized formats]] used in camcorders and video editing use less complex compression schemes that restrict their prediction techniques to intra-frame prediction.\n\nUsually video compression additionally employs [[lossy compression]] techniques like [[quantization (image processing)|quantization]] that reduce aspects of the source data that are (more or less) irrelevant to the human visual perception by exploiting perceptual features of human vision. For example, small differences in color are more difficult to perceive than are changes in brightness. Compression algorithms can average a color across these similar areas to reduce space, in a manner similar to those used in [[JPEG]] image compression.<ref name=\"TomLane\"/> As in all lossy compression, there is a [[trade-off]] between [[video quality]] and [[bit rate]], cost of processing the compression and decompression, and system requirements. Highly compressed video may present visible or distracting [[compression artifact|artifacts]].\n\nOther methods than the prevalent DCT-based transform formats, such as [[fractal compression]], [[matching pursuit]] and the use of a [[discrete wavelet transform]] (DWT), have been the subject of some research, but are typically not used in practical products (except for the use of [[wavelet compression|wavelet coding]] as still-image coders without motion compensation). Interest in fractal compression seems to be waning, due to recent theoretical analysis showing a comparative lack of effectiveness of such methods.<ref name=\"faxin47\"/>\n\n===== Inter-frame coding =====\n{{main|Inter frame}}\n{{see|Motion compensation}}\n\nInter-frame coding works by comparing each frame in the video with the previous one. Individual frames of a video sequence are compared from one frame to the next, and the [[video codec|video compression codec]] sends only the [[residual frame|differences]] to the reference frame. If the frame contains areas where nothing has moved, the system can simply issue a short command that copies that part of the previous frame into the next one. If sections of the frame move in a simple manner, the compressor can emit a (slightly longer) command that tells the decompressor to shift, rotate, lighten, or darken the copy. This longer command still remains much shorter than intraframe compression. Usually the encoder will also transmit a residue signal which describes the remaining more subtle differences to the reference imagery. Using entropy coding, these residue signals have a more compact representation than the full signal. In areas of video with more motion, the compression must encode more data to keep up with the larger number of pixels that are changing. Commonly during explosions, flames, flocks of animals, and in some panning shots, the high-frequency detail leads to quality decreases or to increases in the [[variable bitrate]].\n\n==== Hybrid block-based transform formats ====\n{{See|Discrete cosine transform}}\n[[File:Hybrid video encoder processing stages.svg|thumb|upright=2|Processing stages of a typical video encoder]]\nToday, nearly all commonly used video compression methods (e.g., those in standards approved by the [[ITU-T]] or [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]) share the same basic architecture that dates back to [[H.261]] which was standardized in 1988 by the ITU-T. They mostly rely on the DCT, applied to rectangular blocks of neighboring pixels, and temporal prediction using [[motion vector]]s, as well as nowadays also an in-loop filtering step.\n\nIn the prediction stage, various [[data deduplication|deduplication]] and difference-coding techniques are applied that help decorrelate data and describe new data based on already transmitted data.\n\nThen rectangular blocks of (residue) [[pixel]] data are transformed to the frequency domain to ease targeting irrelevant information in quantization and for some spatial redundancy reduction. The [[discrete cosine transform]] (DCT) that is widely used in this regard was introduced by [[N. Ahmed]], T. Natarajan and [[K. R. Rao]] in 1974.<ref name=\"DCT\"/>\n\nIn the main lossy processing stage that data gets quantized in order to reduce information that is irrelevant to human visual perception.\n\nIn the last stage statistical redundancy gets largely eliminated by an [[entropy encoding|entropy coder]] which often applies some form of arithmetic coding.\n\nIn an additional in-loop filtering stage various filters can be applied to the reconstructed image signal. By computing these filters also inside the encoding loop they can help compression because they can be applied to reference material before it gets used in the prediction process and they can be guided using the original signal. The most popular example are [[deblocking filter]]s that blur out blocking artefacts from quantization discontinuities at transform block boundaries.\n\n==== History ====\n{{Main|Video coding format#History}}\n\nIn 1967, A.H.

Lossless compression reduces bits by identifying and eliminating [[Redundancy (information theory)|statistical redundancy]]. No information is lost in lossless compression. Lossy compression reduces bits by removing unnecessary or less important information.<ref name=\"PujarKadlaskar\"/> Typically, a device that performs data compression is referred to as an encoder, and one that performs the reversal of the process (decompression) as a decoder.\n\nThe process of reducing the size of a [[data file]] is often referred to as data compression. In the context of [[data transmission]], it is called source coding; encoding done at the source of the data before it is stored or transmitted.<ref name=\"Salomon\"/> Source coding should not be confused with [[channel coding]], for error detection and correction or [[line coding]], the means for mapping data onto a signal.\n\nCompression is useful because it reduces resources required to store and transmit data. [[Computational resource]]s are consumed in the compression and decompression processes. Data compression is subject to a [[Space\u2013time tradeoff|space\u2013time complexity trade-off]]. For instance, [[#video|a compression scheme for video]] may require expensive [[Electronic hardware|hardware]] for the video to be decompressed fast enough to be viewed as it is being decompressed, and the option to decompress the video in full before watching it may be inconvenient or require additional storage. The design of data compression schemes involves trade-offs among various factors, including the degree of compression, the amount of distortion introduced (when using [[lossy data compression]]), and the computational resources required to compress and decompress the data.<ref name=\"MittalVetter\"/><ref name=\"Tank\"/>\n\n== Lossless ==\n{{Main|Lossless compression}}\n\n[[Lossless data compression]] [[algorithm]]s usually exploit [[Redundancy (information theory)|statistical redundancy]] to represent data without losing any [[Self-information|information]], so that the process is reversible. Lossless compression is possible because most real-world data exhibits statistical redundancy. For example, an image may have areas of color that do not change over several pixels; instead of coding \"red pixel, red pixel, ...\" the data may be encoded as \"279 red pixels\". This is a basic example of [[run-length encoding]]; there are many schemes to reduce file size by eliminating redundancy.\n\nThe [[Lempel\u2013Ziv]] (LZ) compression methods are among the most popular algorithms for lossless storage.<ref name=\"Optimized LZW\"/>  [[DEFLATE]] is a variation on LZ optimized for decompression speed and compression ratio, but compression can be slow. In the mid-1980s, following work by [[Terry Welch]], the [[Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Welch]] (LZW) algorithm rapidly became the method of choice for most general-purpose compression systems. LZW is used in [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]] images, programs such as PKZIP, and hardware devices such as modems.<ref name=\"Wolfram\"/> LZ methods use a table-based compression model where table entries are substituted for repeated strings of data. For most LZ methods, this table is generated dynamically from earlier data in the input. The table itself is often [[Huffman coding|Huffman encoded]]. [[Grammar-based codes]] like this can compress highly repetitive input extremely effectively, for instance, a biological data collection of the same or closely related species, a huge versioned document collection, internet archival, etc. The basic task of grammar-based codes is constructing a context-free grammar deriving a single string. Other practical grammar compression algorithms include [[Sequitur algorithm|Sequitur]] and Re-Pair.\n\nThe strongest modern lossless compressors use [[Randomized algorithm|probabilistic]] models, such as [[prediction by partial matching]]. The [[Burrows\u2013Wheeler transform]] can also be viewed as an indirect form of statistical modelling.<ref name=\"mahmud2\"/> In a further refinement of the direct use of [[probabilistic model]]ling, statistical estimates can be coupled to an algorithm called [[arithmetic coding]]. Arithmetic coding is a more modern coding technique that uses the mathematical calculations of a [[finite-state machine]] to produce a string of encoded bits from a series of input data symbols. It can achieve superior compression compared to other techniques such as the better-known Huffman algorithm. It uses an internal memory state to avoid the need to perform a one-to-one mapping of individual input symbols to distinct representations that use an integer number of bits, and it clears out the internal memory only after encoding the entire string of data symbols. Arithmetic coding applies especially well to adaptive data compression tasks where the statistics vary and are context-dependent, as it can be easily coupled with an adaptive model of the [[probability distribution]] of the input data. An early example of the use of arithmetic coding was in an optional (but not widely used) feature of the [[JPEG]] image coding standard.<ref name=TomLane/> It has since been applied in various other designs including [[H.263]], [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC]] and [[HEVC]] for video coding.<ref name=\"HEVC\"/>\n\n== Lossy ==\n{{Main|Lossy compression}}\n\nIn the late 1980s, digital images became more common, and standards for lossless [[image compression]] emerged. In the early 1990s, lossy compression methods began to be widely used.<ref name=\"Wolfram\"/> In these schemes, some loss of information is accepted as dropping nonessential detail can save storage space. There is a corresponding [[trade-off]] between preserving information and reducing size. Lossy data compression schemes are designed by research on how people perceive the data in question. For example, the human eye is more sensitive to subtle variations in [[luminance]] than it is to the variations in color. [[JPEG]] image compression works in part by rounding off nonessential bits of information.<ref name=\"Arcangel\"/>  A number of popular compression formats exploit these perceptual differences, including [[psychoacoustics]] for sound, and [[psychovisual]]s for images and video.\n\nMost forms of lossy compression are based on [[transform coding]], especially the [[discrete cosine transform]] (DCT). It was first proposed in 1972 by [[N. Ahmed|Nasir Ahmed]], who then developed a working algorithm with T. Natarajan and [[K. R.

Similarly, [[DVD]]s, [[Blu-ray]] and [[streaming video]] use the lossy [[video coding format]].\n\nIn lossy audio compression, methods of psychoacoustics are used to remove non-audible (or less audible) components of the [[audio signal]]. Compression of human speech is often performed with even more specialized techniques; [[speech coding]] is distinguished as a separate discipline from general-purpose audio compression. Speech coding is used in [[internet telephony]], for example, audio compression is used for CD ripping and is decoded by the audio players.<ref name=\"mahmud2\"/>\n\n== Theory ==\nThe theoretical basis for compression is provided by [[information theory]] and, more specifically, [[algorithmic information theory]] for lossless compression and [[rate\u2013distortion theory]] for lossy compression. These areas of study were essentially created by [[Claude Shannon]], who published fundamental papers on the topic in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Other topics associated with compression include [[coding theory]] and [[statistical inference]].<ref name=\"Marak\"/>\n\n=== Machine learning ===\nThere is a close connection between [[machine learning]] and compression. A system that predicts the [[posterior probabilities]] of a sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data compression (by using [[arithmetic coding]] on the output distribution). An optimal compressor can be used for prediction (by finding the symbol that compresses best, given the previous history). This equivalence has been used as a justification for using data compression as a benchmark for \"general intelligence\".<ref name=\"Mahoney\"/><ref name=\"Market Efficiency\"/><ref name=\"Ben-Gal\"/>\n\nAn alternative view can show compression algorithms implicitly map strings into implicit [[feature space vector]]s, and compression-based similarity measures compute similarity within these feature spaces. For each compressor C(.) we define an associated vector space \u2135, such that C(.) maps an input string x, corresponds to the vector norm ||~x||. An exhaustive examination of the feature spaces underlying all compression algorithms is precluded by space; instead, feature vectors chooses to examine three representative lossless compression methods, LZW, LZ77, and PPM.<ref name=\"ScullyBrodley\"/>\n\n=== Data differencing ===\n{{main|Data differencing}}\nData compression can be viewed as a special case of [[data differencing]].<ref name=\"RFC 3284\"/><ref name=\"Vdelta\"/> Data differencing consists of producing a ''difference'' given a ''source'' and a ''target,'' with patching reproducing the ''target'' given a ''source'' and a ''difference.'' Since there is no separate source and target in data compression, one can consider data compression as data differencing with empty source data, the compressed file corresponding to a difference from nothing. This is the same as considering absolute [[entropy (information theory)|entropy]] (corresponding to data compression) as a special case of [[relative entropy]] (corresponding to data differencing) with no initial data.\n\nThe term ''differential compression'' is used to emphasize the data differencing connection.\n\n== Uses ==\n=== Image ===\n{{Main|Image compression}}\n\n[[Entropy coding]] originated in the 1940s with the introduction of [[Shannon\u2013Fano coding]],<ref name=\"Shannon\"/> the basis for [[Huffman coding]] which was developed in 1950.<ref name=\"Huffman\"/> [[Transform coding]] dates back to the late 1960s, with the introduction of [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT) coding in 1968 and the [[Hadamard transform]] in 1969.<ref name=\"Hadamard\"/>\n\nAn important [[image compression]] technique is the [[discrete cosine transform]] (DCT), a technique developed in the early 1970s.<ref name=\"Ahmed\"/> DCT is the basis for [[JPEG]], a [[lossy compression]] format which was introduced by the [[Joint Photographic Experts Group]] (JPEG) in 1992.<ref name=\"t81\">{{cite web |title=T.81 \u2013 DIGITAL COMPRESSION AND CODING OF CONTINUOUS-TONE STILL IMAGES \u2013 REQUIREMENTS AND GUIDELINES |url=https://www.w3.org/Graphics/JPEG/itu-t81.pdf |publisher=[[CCITT]] |date=September 1992 |accessdate=12 July 2019}}</ref> JPEG greatly reduces the amount of data required to represent an image at the cost of a relatively small reduction in image quality and has become the most widely used [[image file format]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The JPEG image format explained |url=https://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/photography/what-is-a-jpeg-11364206889349 |website=[[BT.com]] |publisher=[[BT Group]] |accessdate=5 August 2019 |date=31 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Baraniuk |first1=Chris |title=Copy protections could come to JPEGs |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-34538705 |accessdate=13 September 2019 |work=[[BBC News]] |agency=[[BBC]] |date=15 October 2015}}</ref> Its highly efficient DCT-based compression algorithm was largely responsible for the wide proliferation of [[digital images]] and [[digital photo]]s.<ref name=\"Atlantic\">{{cite web |title=What Is a JPEG?

[[List of codecs#Audio|Audio compression algorithms]] are implemented in [[software]] as audio [[codec]]s. Lossy audio compression algorithms provide higher compression at the cost of fidelity and are used in numerous audio applications. These algorithms almost all rely on [[psychoacoustics]] to eliminate or reduce fidelity of less audible sounds, thereby reducing the space required to store or transmit them.<ref name=\"mahdi53\"/>\n\nIn both lossy and lossless compression, [[Redundancy (information theory)|information redundancy]] is reduced, using methods such as [[Coding theory|coding]], [[pattern recognition]], and [[linear prediction]] to reduce the amount of information used to represent the uncompressed data.\n\nThe acceptable trade-off between loss of audio quality and transmission or storage size depends upon the application. For example, one 640 MB [[compact disc]] (CD) holds approximately one hour of uncompressed [[high fidelity]] music, less than 2 hours of music compressed losslessly, or 7 hours of music compressed in the [[MP3]] format at a medium [[bit rate]]. A digital sound recorder can typically store around 200 hours of clearly intelligible speech in 640 MB.<ref name=\"Olympus WS-120\"/>\n\nLossless audio compression produces a representation of digital data that decompress to an exact digital duplicate of the original audio stream, unlike playback from lossy compression techniques such as [[Vorbis]] and [[MP3]]. Compression ratios are around 50\u201360% of original size,<ref name=\"FLAC\"/> which is similar to those for generic lossless data compression. Lossless compression is unable to attain high compression ratios due to the complexity of [[waveform]]s and the rapid changes in sound forms. Codecs like [[FLAC]], [[Shorten (file format)|Shorten]], and [[TTA (codec)|TTA]] use [[linear prediction]] to estimate the spectrum of the signal. Many of these algorithms use [[convolution]] with the filter [-1 1] to slightly [[white noise|whiten]] or [[decorrelation|flatten]] the spectrum, thereby allowing traditional lossless compression to work more efficiently. The process is reversed upon decompression.\n\nWhen audio files are to be processed, either by further compression or for [[Audio editing|editing]], it is desirable to work from an unchanged original (uncompressed or losslessly compressed). Processing of a lossily compressed file for some purpose usually produces a final result inferior to the creation of the same compressed file from an uncompressed original. In addition to sound editing or mixing, lossless audio compression is often used for archival storage, or as master copies.\n\nA number of lossless audio compression formats exist. [[Shorten (file format)|Shorten]] was an early lossless format. Newer ones include [[Free Lossless Audio Codec]] (FLAC), Apple's [[Apple Lossless]] (ALAC), [[MPEG-4 ALS]], Microsoft's [[Windows Media Audio 9 Lossless]] (WMA Lossless), [[Monkey's Audio]], [[TTA (codec)|TTA]], and [[WavPack]]. See [[List of codecs#Lossless data compression|list of lossless codecs]] for a complete listing.\n\nSome [[audio file format|audio formats]] feature a combination of a lossy format and a lossless correction; this allows stripping the correction to easily obtain a lossy file. Such formats include [[MPEG-4 SLS]] (Scalable to Lossless), [[WavPack]], and [[OptimFROG DualStream]].\n\nOther formats are associated with a distinct system, such as:\n* [[Direct Stream Transfer]], used in [[Super Audio CD]]\n* [[Meridian Lossless Packing]], used in [[DVD-Audio]], [[Dolby TrueHD]], [[Blu-ray]] and [[HD DVD]]\n\n==== Lossy audio compression ====\n[[File:AudiodatenkompressionManowarThePowerOfThySword.jpg|thumb|Comparison of [[spectrogram]]s of audio in an uncompressed format and several lossy formats. The lossy spectrograms show [[bandlimiting]] of higher frequencies, a common technique associated with lossy audio compression.]]\n\nLossy audio compression is used in a wide range of applications. In addition to the direct applications (MP3 players or computers), digitally compressed audio streams are used in most video DVDs, digital television, streaming media on the [[internet]], satellite and cable radio, and increasingly in terrestrial radio broadcasts. Lossy compression typically achieves far greater compression than lossless compression (5\u201320% of the original size, rather than 50\u201360%), by discarding less-critical data.<ref name=\"Jaiswal\"/>\n\nThe innovation of lossy audio compression was to use [[psychoacoustics]] to recognize that not all data in an audio stream can be perceived by the human [[auditory system]]. Most lossy compression reduces perceptual redundancy by first identifying perceptually irrelevant sounds, that is, sounds that are very hard to hear. Typical examples include high frequencies or sounds that occur at the same time as louder sounds. Those sounds are coded with decreased accuracy or not at all.\n\nDue to the nature of lossy algorithms, [[audio quality]] suffers when a file is decompressed and recompressed ([[digital generation loss]]). This makes lossy compression unsuitable for storing the intermediate results in professional audio engineering applications, such as sound editing and multitrack recording. However, they are very popular with end users (particularly [[MP3]]) as a megabyte can store about a minute's worth of music at adequate quality.\n\n===== Coding methods =====\nTo determine what information in an audio signal is perceptually irrelevant, most lossy compression algorithms use transforms such as the [[modified discrete cosine transform]] (MDCT) to convert [[time domain]] sampled waveforms into a transform domain. Once transformed, typically into the [[frequency domain]], component frequencies can be allocated bits according to how audible they are. Audibility of spectral components calculated using the [[absolute threshold of hearing]] and the principles of [[simultaneous masking]]\u2014the phenomenon wherein a signal is masked by another signal separated by frequency\u2014and, in some cases, [[temporal masking]]\u2014where a signal is masked by another signal separated by time. [[Equal-loudness contour]]s may also be used to weight the perceptual importance of components. Models of the human ear-brain combination incorporating such effects are often called [[psychoacoustic model]]s.<ref name=\"faxin47\"/>\n\nOther types of lossy compressors, such as the [[linear predictive coding]] (LPC) used with speech, are source-based coders. These coders use a model of the sound's generator (such as the human vocal tract with LPC) to whiten the audio signal (i.e., flatten its spectrum) before [[Quantization (signal processing)|quantization]]. LPC may be thought of as a basic perceptual coding technique: reconstruction of an audio signal using a linear predictor shapes the coder's quantization noise into the spectrum of the target signal, partially masking it.<ref name=\"Jaiswal\"/>\n\nLossy formats are often used for the distribution of streaming audio or interactive applications (such as the coding of speech for digital transmission in cell phone networks). In such applications, the data must be decompressed as the data flows, rather than after the entire data stream has been transmitted. Not all audio codecs can be used for streaming applications, and for such applications a codec designed to stream data effectively will usually be chosen.<ref name=\"Jaiswal\"/>\n\nLatency results from the methods used to encode and decode the data. Some codecs will analyze a longer segment of the data to optimize efficiency, and then code it in a manner that requires a larger segment of data at one time to decode. (Often codecs create segments called a \"frame\" to create discrete data segments for encoding and decoding.) The inherent [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] of the coding algorithm can be critical; for example, when there is a two-way transmission of data, such as with a telephone conversation, significant delays may seriously degrade the perceived quality.\n\nIn contrast to the speed of compression, which is proportional to the number of operations required by the algorithm, here latency refers to the number of samples that must be analysed before a block of audio is processed. In the minimum case, latency is zero samples (e.g., if the coder/decoder simply reduces the number of bits used to quantize the signal). Time domain algorithms such as LPC also often have low latencies, hence their popularity in speech coding for telephony. In algorithms such as MP3, however, a large number of samples have to be analyzed to implement a psychoacoustic model in the frequency domain, and latency is on the order of 23&nbsp;ms (46&nbsp;ms for two-way communication).\n\n===== Speech encoding =====\n[[Speech encoding]] is an important category of audio data compression. The perceptual models used to estimate what a human ear can hear are generally somewhat different from those used for music. The range of frequencies needed to convey the sounds of a human voice are normally far narrower than that needed for music, and the sound is normally less complex. As a result, speech can be encoded at high quality using a relatively low bit rate.\n\nIf the data to be compressed is analog (such as a voltage that varies with time), quantization is employed to digitize it into numbers (normally integers). This is referred to as analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion. If the integers generated by quantization are 8 bits each, then the entire range of the analog signal is divided into 256 intervals and all the signal values within an interval are quantized to the same number. If 16-bit integers are generated, then the range of the analog signal is divided into 65,536 intervals.\n\nThis relation illustrates the compromise between high resolution (a large number of analog intervals) and high compression (small integers generated). This application of quantization is used by several speech compression methods. This is accomplished, in general, by some combination of two approaches:\n* Only encoding sounds that could be made by a single human voice.\n* Throwing away more of the data in the signal\u2014keeping just enough to reconstruct an \"intelligible\" voice rather than the full frequency range of human [[hearing (sense)|hearing]].\n\nPerhaps the earliest algorithms used in speech encoding (and audio data compression in general) were the [[A-law algorithm]] and the [[\u03bc-law algorithm]].\n\n==== History ====\n[[File:Placa-audioPC-925.jpg|right|thumb|Solidyne 922: The world's first commercial audio bit compression [[sound card]] for PC, 1990]]\n\nIn 1950, [[Bell Labs]] filed the patent on [[differential pulse-code modulation]] (DPCM).<ref name=\"DPCM\"/> [[Adaptive DPCM]] (ADPCM) was introduced by P.

Twenty years later, almost all the radio stations in the world were using similar technology manufactured by a number of companies.\n\nA literature compendium for a large variety of audio coding systems was published in the IEEE's ''Journal on Selected Areas in Communications'' (''JSAC''), in February 1988. While there were some papers from before that time, this collection documented an entire variety of finished, working audio coders, nearly all of them using perceptual (i.e. masking) techniques and some kind of frequency analysis and back-end noiseless coding.<ref name=\"Possibilities\"/> Several of these papers remarked on the difficulty of obtaining good, clean digital audio for research purposes. Most, if not all, of the authors in the ''JSAC'' edition were also active in the [[MPEG-1]] Audio committee, which created the MP3 format.\n\n=== Video ===\n{{see also|Video coding format|Video codec}}\nVideo compression is a practical implementation of source coding in information theory. In practice, most video codecs are used alongside audio compression techniques to store the separate but complementary data streams as one combined package using so-called ''[[digital container format|container format]]s''.<ref name=\"CSIP\"/>\n\n[[Uncompressed video]] requires a very high [[Uncompressed video#Storage and Data Rates for Uncompressed Video|data rate]]. Although [[List of codecs#Lossless video compression|lossless video compression]] codecs perform at a compression factor of 5 to 12, a typical [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264]] lossy compression video has a compression factor between 20 and 200.<ref name=\"MSU2007\"/>\n\nThe two key video compression techniques used in [[video coding standards]] are the [[discrete cosine transform]] (DCT) and [[motion compensation]] (MC).

Such data usually contains abundant amounts of spatial and temporal [[redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]]. Video compression algorithms attempt to reduce redundancy and store information more compactly.\n\nMost [[video compression formats]] and [[video codec|codecs]] exploit both spatial and temporal redundancy (e.g. through difference coding with [[motion compensation]]). Similarities can be encoded by only storing differences between e.g. temporally adjacent frames (inter-frame coding) or spatially adjacent pixels (intra-frame coding).\n[[inter frame|Inter-frame]] compression (a temporal [[delta encoding]]) is one of the most powerful compression techniques. It (re)uses data from one or more earlier or later frames in a sequence to describe the current frame. [[Intra-frame coding]], on the other hand, uses only data from within the current frame, effectively being still-[[image compression]].<ref name=\"faxin47\"/>\n\nA [[Video coding format#Intra-frame video coding formats|class of specialized formats]] used in camcorders and video editing use less complex compression schemes that restrict their prediction techniques to intra-frame prediction.\n\nUsually video compression additionally employs [[lossy compression]] techniques like [[quantization (image processing)|quantization]] that reduce aspects of the source data that are (more or less) irrelevant to the human visual perception by exploiting perceptual features of human vision. For example, small differences in color are more difficult to perceive than are changes in brightness. Compression algorithms can average a color across these similar areas to reduce space, in a manner similar to those used in [[JPEG]] image compression.<ref name=\"TomLane\"/> As in all lossy compression, there is a [[trade-off]] between [[video quality]] and [[bit rate]], cost of processing the compression and decompression, and system requirements. Highly compressed video may present visible or distracting [[compression artifact|artifacts]].\n\nOther methods than the prevalent DCT-based transform formats, such as [[fractal compression]], [[matching pursuit]] and the use of a [[discrete wavelet transform]] (DWT), have been the subject of some research, but are typically not used in practical products (except for the use of [[wavelet compression|wavelet coding]] as still-image coders without motion compensation). Interest in fractal compression seems to be waning, due to recent theoretical analysis showing a comparative lack of effectiveness of such methods.<ref name=\"faxin47\"/>\n\n===== Inter-frame coding =====\n{{main|Inter frame}}\n{{see|Motion compensation}}\n\nInter-frame coding works by comparing each frame in the video with the previous one. Individual frames of a video sequence are compared from one frame to the next, and the [[video codec|video compression codec]] sends only the [[residual frame|differences]] to the reference frame. If the frame contains areas where nothing has moved, the system can simply issue a short command that copies that part of the previous frame into the next one. If sections of the frame move in a simple manner, the compressor can emit a (slightly longer) command that tells the decompressor to shift, rotate, lighten, or darken the copy. This longer command still remains much shorter than intraframe compression. Usually the encoder will also transmit a residue signal which describes the remaining more subtle differences to the reference imagery. Using entropy coding, these residue signals have a more compact representation than the full signal. In areas of video with more motion, the compression must encode more data to keep up with the larger number of pixels that are changing. Commonly during explosions, flames, flocks of animals, and in some panning shots, the high-frequency detail leads to quality decreases or to increases in the [[variable bitrate]].\n\n==== Hybrid block-based transform formats ====\n{{See|Discrete cosine transform}}\n[[File:Hybrid video encoder processing stages.svg|thumb|upright=2|Processing stages of a typical video encoder]]\nToday, nearly all commonly used video compression methods (e.g., those in standards approved by the [[ITU-T]] or [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]) share the same basic architecture that dates back to [[H.261]] which was standardized in 1988 by the ITU-T. They mostly rely on the DCT, applied to rectangular blocks of neighboring pixels, and temporal prediction using [[motion vector]]s, as well as nowadays also an in-loop filtering step.\n\nIn the prediction stage, various [[data deduplication|deduplication]] and difference-coding techniques are applied that help decorrelate data and describe new data based on already transmitted data.\n\nThen rectangular blocks of (residue) [[pixel]] data are transformed to the frequency domain to ease targeting irrelevant information in quantization and for some spatial redundancy reduction. The [[discrete cosine transform]] (DCT) that is widely used in this regard was introduced by [[N. Ahmed]], T. Natarajan and [[K. R. Rao]] in 1974.<ref name=\"DCT\"/>\n\nIn the main lossy processing stage that data gets quantized in order to reduce information that is irrelevant to human visual perception.\n\nIn the last stage statistical redundancy gets largely eliminated by an [[entropy encoding|entropy coder]] which often applies some form of arithmetic coding.\n\nIn an additional in-loop filtering stage various filters can be applied to the reconstructed image signal. By computing these filters also inside the encoding loop they can help compression because they can be applied to reference material before it gets used in the prediction process and they can be guided using the original signal. The most popular example are [[deblocking filter]]s that blur out blocking artefacts from quantization discontinuities at transform block boundaries.\n\n==== History ====\n{{Main|Video coding format#History}}\n\nIn 1967, A.H.

On 5 July 1816, at least 147 people were set adrift on a hurriedly constructed raft; all but 15 died in the 13&nbsp;days before their rescue, and those who survived endured starvation and dehydration and practiced cannibalism. The event became an international scandal, in part because its cause was widely attributed to the incompetence of the French captain.\n\nG\u00e9ricault chose to depict this event in order to launch his career with a large-scale uncommissioned work on a subject that had already generated great public interest.<ref name=\"Louvre\">\"[https://archive.today/20121209133033/http://www.louvre.fr/llv/activite/detail_parcours.jsp?CURRENT_LLV_PARCOURS%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226914&CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673327664&CURRENT_LLV_CHEMINEMENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673327664&bmLocale=en The Raft of the Medusa]\". [[Louvre]]. Retrieved on 19 November 2008.</ref> The event fascinated him, and before he began work on the final painting, he undertook extensive research and produced many preparatory sketches. He interviewed two of the survivors and constructed a detailed scale model of the raft. He visited hospitals and morgues where he could view, first-hand, the colour and texture of the flesh of the dying and dead. As he had anticipated, the painting proved highly controversial at its first appearance in the 1819 [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]], attracting passionate praise and condemnation in equal measure. However, it established his international reputation and today is widely seen as seminal in the early history of the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] in French painting.\n\nAlthough ''The Raft of the Medusa'' retains elements of the traditions of [[history painting]], in both its choice of subject matter and its dramatic presentation, it represents a break from the calm and order of the prevailing [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] school. G\u00e9ricault's work attracted wide attention from its first showing and was then exhibited in London. The [[Louvre]] acquired it soon after the artist's death at the age of 32. The painting's influence can be seen in the works of [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]], [[J. M. W. Turner]], [[Gustave Courbet]], and [[\u00c9douard Manet]].<ref>Fried, 92</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n{{main|French frigate M\u00e9duse (1810)}}\n\n[[File:Raft of M\u00e9duse-Alexandre Corr\u00e9ard-IMG 4788-cropped.JPG|thumb|upright|Plan of ''The Raft of the Medusa'' at the moment of its crew's rescue<ref>Grigsby, Darcy Grimaldo.

She headed a convoy of three other ships: the [[Combat stores ship|storeship]] ''Loire'', the [[brig]] [[HMS Plumper (1804)|''Argus'']] and the [[corvette]] ''\u00c9cho''. Viscount Hugues Duroy de Chaumereys had been appointed [[Ranks in the French Navy|captain]] of the frigate despite having scarcely sailed in 20&nbsp;years.<ref>Zarzeczny, Matthew. \"Theodore G\u00e9ricault's 'The Raft of the M\u00e9duse' Part I\".

According to an early British reviewer, the work is set at a moment when \"the ruin of the raft may be said to be complete\".<ref name=\"Christine\" /> The painting is on a monumental scale of {{convert|491|x|716|cm|in|abbr=on}}, so that most of the figures rendered are life-sized<ref name=\"Boime142\">Boime, 142</ref> and those in the foreground almost twice life-size, pushed close to the picture plane and crowding onto the viewer, who is drawn into the physical action as a participant.<ref name=banham/>\n\n[[File:Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault \"The raft of the Medusa\".jpg|thumb|Detail from the lower left corner of the canvas showing two dying figures]]\n\nThe makeshift raft is shown as barely seaworthy as it rides the deep waves, while the men are rendered as broken and in utter despair. One old man holds the corpse of his son at his knees; another tears his hair out in frustration and defeat. A number of bodies litter the foreground, waiting to be swept away by the surrounding waves. The men in the middle have just viewed a rescue ship; one points it out to another, and an African crew member, Jean Charles,<ref>Hagen & Hagen, 378</ref> stands on an empty barrel and frantically waves his handkerchief to draw the ship's attention.<ref>Muther, 224</ref>\n\nThe pictorial composition of the painting is constructed upon two pyramidal structures. The perimeter of the large mast on the left of the canvas forms the first. The horizontal grouping of dead and dying figures in the foreground forms the base from which the survivors emerge, surging upward towards the emotional peak, where the central figure waves desperately at a rescue ship.\n\n[[File:Radeau meduse structure.jpg|thumb|left|Diagram showing the outline of the two pyramidal structures that form the basis of the work. The position of the ''Argus'' rescue vessel is indicated by the yellow dot.]]\nThe viewer's attention is first drawn to the centre of the canvas, then follows the directional flow of the survivors' bodies, viewed from behind and straining to the right.<ref name=\"Boime142\" /> According to the art historian Justin Wintle, \"a single horizontal diagonal rhythm [leads] us from the dead at the bottom left, to the living at the apex.\"<ref name=\"Wintle246\">Wintle, 246</ref> Two other diagonal lines are used to heighten the dramatic tension. One follows the mast and its rigging and leads the viewer's eye towards an approaching wave that threatens to engulf the raft, while the second, composed of reaching figures, leads to the distant silhouette of the ''Argus'', the ship that eventually rescued the survivors.<ref name=\"Louvre\" />\n\nG\u00e9ricault's palette is composed of pallid flesh tones, and the murky colours of the survivors' clothes, the sea and the clouds.<ref name=\"Wilkin\" /> Overall the painting is dark and relies largely on the use of sombre, mostly brown pigments, a palette that G\u00e9ricault believed was effective in suggesting tragedy and pain.<ref name=\"Miles, 180\">Miles, 180</ref> The work's lighting has been described as \"[[Caravaggio|Caravaggesque]]\",<ref name=\"Nov85\" /> after the Italian artist closely associated with [[tenebrism]]\u2014the use of violent contrast between light and dark. Even G\u00e9ricault's treatment of the sea is muted, being rendered in dark greens rather than the deep blues that could have afforded contrast with the tones of the raft and its figures.<ref name=\"M226\">Muther, 225\u201326</ref> From the distant area of the rescue ship, a bright light shines, providing illumination to an otherwise dull brown scene.<ref name=\"M226\"/>\n\n== Execution ==\n\n=== Research and preparatory studies ===\n\n[[File:Medusa study 1.jpg|thumb|G\u00e9ricault's ''Study for \"The Raft of the Medusa\"'', pen and brown ink, 17.6&nbsp;cm \u00d7 24.5&nbsp;cm, [[Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille|Musee des Beaux-Arts]], [[Lille]], France]]\nG\u00e9ricault was captivated by accounts of the widely publicised 1816 shipwreck, and realised that a depiction of the event might be an opportunity to establish his reputation as a painter.<ref name=\"M169\">Miles, 169</ref> Having decided to proceed, he undertook extensive research before he began the painting. In early 1818, he met with two survivors: Henri Savigny, a surgeon, and [[Alexandre Corr\u00e9ard]], an engineer from the [[\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure d'arts et m\u00e9tiers]]. Their emotional descriptions of their experiences largely inspired the tone of the final painting.<ref name=\"Christine\">Riding (February 2003)</ref> According to the art historian Georges-Antoine Borias, \"G\u00e9ricault established his studio across from Beaujon hospital. And here began a mournful descent. Behind locked doors he threw himself into his work. Nothing repulsed him. He was dreaded and avoided.\"<ref>Borias, 11:38</ref>\n\nEarlier travels had exposed G\u00e9ricault to victims of insanity and plague, and while researching the ''M\u00e9duse'' his effort to be historically accurate and realistic led to an obsession with the [[Rigor mortis|stiffness]] of corpses.<ref name=\"Eitner\" /> To achieve the most authentic rendering of the flesh tones of the dead,<ref name=\"Louvre\" /> he made sketches of bodies in the morgue of the Hospital Beaujon,<ref name=\"M169\" /> studied the faces of dying hospital patients,<ref name=christiansen/> brought severed limbs back to his studio to study their decay,<ref name=\"M169\"/><ref>''[[:File:Anatomical Pieces.JPG|Anatomical Pieces]]'', an unusual still-life which G\u00e9ricault produced in 1818\u20131819, shows some of these dismembered limbs.</ref> and for a fortnight drew a severed head, borrowed from a lunatic asylum and stored on his studio roof.<ref name=christiansen/>\n\n[[File:Medusa Study 2.jpg|thumb|left|''Cannibalism on the Raft of the Medusa'', crayon, ink wash, and gouache on paper, 28&nbsp;cm \u00d7 38&nbsp;cm, [[Louvre]].

The ship, however, passed by. In the words of one of the surviving crew members, \"From the delirium of joy, we fell into profound despondency and grief.\"<ref name=\"R77\" />\n\n[[File:Meduse-Gericault-IMG 4808-cropped.JPG|thumb|Sailors of the ''M\u00e9duse'' detained by the British after the sinking.

In his orderly studio, the artist worked in a methodical fashion in complete silence and found that even the noise of a mouse was sufficient to break his concentration.<ref name=christiansen/>\n\n[[File:Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault - Le Radeau de la M\u00e9duse esquisse (salon de 1819).jpg|thumb|left|''Study'' c. 1818\u20131819, 38&nbsp;cm \u00d7 46&nbsp;cm, [[Louvre]].

The work represents, in the words of Christine Riding, \"the fallacy of hope and pointless suffering, and at worst, the basic human instinct to survive, which had superseded all moral considerations and plunged civilised man into barbarism\".<ref name=\"Christine\"/>\n\nThe unblemished musculature of the central figure waving to the rescue ship is reminiscent of the Neoclassical, however the naturalism of light and shadow, the authenticity of the desperation shown by the survivors and the emotional character of the composition differentiate it from Neoclassical austerity. It was a further departure from the religious or classical themes of earlier works because it depicted contemporary events with ordinary and unheroic figures. Both the choice of subject matter and the heightened manner in which the dramatic moment is depicted are typical of Romantic painting\u2014strong indications of the extent to which G\u00e9ricault had moved from the prevalent Neoclassical movement.<ref name=\"Wilkin\"/>\n\nHubert Wellington said that while Delacroix was a lifelong admirer of Gros, the dominating enthusiasm of his youth was for G\u00e9ricault. The dramatic composition of G\u00e9ricault, with its strong contrasts of tone and unconventional gestures, stimulated Delacroix to trust his own creative impulses on a large work. Delacroix said, \"G\u00e9ricault allowed me to see his ''Raft of Medusa'' while he was still working on it.\"<ref name=Wellingtonxi/> The painting's influence is seen in Delacroix's ''[[The Barque of Dante]]'' (1822) and reappears as inspiration in Delacroix's later works, such as ''The Shipwreck of Don Juan'' (1840).<ref name=\"N14\" />\n\n[[File:Delacroix barque of dante 1822 louvre 189cmx246cm 950px.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]], ''[[The Barque of Dante]]'', 1822. ''The Raft of the Medusa'''s influence on the work of the young Delacroix was immediately apparent in this painting, as well as in later works.<ref name=\"N14\" />]]\n\nAccording to Wellington, Delacroix's masterpiece of 1830, ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'', springs directly from G\u00e9ricault's ''The Raft of the Medusa'' and Delacroix's own ''[[The Massacre at Chios|Massacre at Chios]]''. Wellington wrote that \"While G\u00e9ricault carried his interest in actual detail to the point of searching for more survivors from the wreck as models, Delacroix felt his composition more vividly as a whole, thought of his figures and crowds as types, and dominated them by the symbolic figure of Republican Liberty which is one of his finest plastic inventions.\"<ref>Wellington, xv</ref>\n<br>\nThe art and sculpture historian Albert Elsen believed that ''The Raft of the Medusa'' and Delacroix's  ''Massacre at Chios'' provided the inspiration for the grandiose sweep of [[Auguste Rodin]]'s monumental sculpture ''[[The Gates of Hell]]''. He wrote that \"Delacroix's ''Massacre at Chios'' and G\u00e9ricault's ''Raft of the Medusa'' confronted Rodin on a heroic scale with the innocent nameless victims of political tragedies&nbsp;...

On 5 July 1816, at least 147 people were set adrift on a hurriedly constructed raft; all but 15 died in the 13&nbsp;days before their rescue, and those who survived endured starvation and dehydration and practiced cannibalism. The event became an international scandal, in part because its cause was widely attributed to the incompetence of the French captain.\n\nG\u00e9ricault chose to depict this event in order to launch his career with a large-scale uncommissioned work on a subject that had already generated great public interest.<ref name=\"Louvre\">\"[https://archive.today/20121209133033/http://www.louvre.fr/llv/activite/detail_parcours.jsp?CURRENT_LLV_PARCOURS%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226914&CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673327664&CURRENT_LLV_CHEMINEMENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673327664&bmLocale=en The Raft of the Medusa]\".

He interviewed two of the survivors and constructed a detailed scale model of the raft. He visited hospitals and morgues where he could view, first-hand, the colour and texture of the flesh of the dying and dead. As he had anticipated, the painting proved highly controversial at its first appearance in the 1819 [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]], attracting passionate praise and condemnation in equal measure. However, it established his international reputation and today is widely seen as seminal in the early history of the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] in French painting.\n\nAlthough ''The Raft of the Medusa'' retains elements of the traditions of [[history painting]], in both its choice of subject matter and its dramatic presentation, it represents a break from the calm and order of the prevailing [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] school.

One old man holds the corpse of his son at his knees; another tears his hair out in frustration and defeat. A number of bodies litter the foreground, waiting to be swept away by the surrounding waves. The men in the middle have just viewed a rescue ship; one points it out to another, and an African crew member, Jean Charles,<ref>Hagen & Hagen, 378</ref> stands on an empty barrel and frantically waves his handkerchief to draw the ship's attention.<ref>Muther, 224</ref>\n\nThe pictorial composition of the painting is constructed upon two pyramidal structures. The perimeter of the large mast on the left of the canvas forms the first. The horizontal grouping of dead and dying figures in the foreground forms the base from which the survivors emerge, surging upward towards the emotional peak, where the central figure waves desperately at a rescue ship.\n\n[[File:Radeau meduse structure.jpg|thumb|left|Diagram showing the outline of the two pyramidal structures that form the basis of the work. The position of the ''Argus'' rescue vessel is indicated by the yellow dot.]]\nThe viewer's attention is first drawn to the centre of the canvas, then follows the directional flow of the survivors' bodies, viewed from behind and straining to the right.<ref name=\"Boime142\" /> According to the art historian Justin Wintle, \"a single horizontal diagonal rhythm [leads] us from the dead at the bottom left, to the living at the apex.\"<ref name=\"Wintle246\">Wintle, 246</ref> Two other diagonal lines are used to heighten the dramatic tension.

He then posed models one at a time, completing each figure before moving onto the next, as opposed to the more usual method of working over the whole composition. The concentration in this way on individual elements gave the work both a \"shocking physicality\"<ref name=\"Wintle246\" /> and a sense of deliberate theatricality\u2014which some critics consider an adverse effect. Over 30&nbsp;years after the completion of the work, his friend Montfort recalled:\n\n:[G\u00e9ricault's method] astonished me as much as his intense industry. He painted directly on the white canvas, without rough sketch or any preparation of any sort, except for the firmly traced contours, and yet the solidity of the work was none the worse for it. I was struck by the keen attention with which he examined the model before touching brush to canvas.

According to the art historian [[Richard Muther (art historian)|Richard Muther]], there is still a strong debt to [[Classicism]] in the work. The fact that the majority of the figures are almost naked, he wrote, arose from a desire to avoid \"unpictorial\" costumes. Muther observes that there is \"still something academic in the figures, which do not seem to be sufficiently weakened by privation, disease, and the struggle with death\".<ref name=\"M226\" />\n\nThe influence of Jacques-Louis David can be seen in the painting's scale, in the sculptural tautness of the figures and in the heightened manner in which a particularly significant \"fruitful moment\"\u2014the first awareness of the approaching ship\u2014is described.<ref name=\"Nov85\">Novotny, 85</ref> In 1793, David also painted an important current event with ''[[The Death of Marat]]''. His painting had an enormous political impact during the time of the [[French Revolution|revolution in France]], and it served as an important precedent for G\u00e9ricault's decision to also paint a current event.

G\u00e9ricault's compositional structure and depiction of the figures are classical, but the contrasting turbulence of the subject represents a significant change in artistic direction and creates an important bridge between Neoclassical and Romantic styles. By 1815, Jacques-Louis David, then in exile in Brussels, was both the leading proponent of the popular [[history painting]] genre, which he had perfected, and a master of the Neoclassical style.<ref>\"[http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/david/ Jacques-Louis David: Empire to Exile]\".

Like Gros, G\u00e9ricault had seen and felt the exhilaration of violence, and was distraught by the human consequences.<ref name=\"Eitner\" />]]\n\nIn his introduction to ''The Journal of Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix'', Hubert Wellington wrote about Delacroix's opinion of the state of French painting just prior to the Salon of 1819. According to Wellington, \"The curious blend of classic with realistic outlook which had been imposed by the discipline of David was now losing both animation and interest. The master himself was nearing his end, and exiled in Belgium. His most docile pupil, Girodet, a refined and cultivated classicist, was producing pictures of astonishing frigidity. G\u00e9rard, immensely successful painter of portraits under the Empire\u2014some of them admirable\u2014fell in with the new vogue for large pictures of history, but without enthusiasm.\"<ref name=\"Wellingtonxi\" />\n\n''The Raft of the Medusa'' contains the gestures and grand scale of traditional history painting; however, it presents ordinary people, rather than heroes, reacting to the unfolding drama.<ref name=\"Boime141\">Boime, 141</ref> G\u00e9ricault's raft pointedly lacks a hero, and his painting presents no cause beyond sheer survival. The work represents, in the words of Christine Riding, \"the fallacy of hope and pointless suffering, and at worst, the basic human instinct to survive, which had superseded all moral considerations and plunged civilised man into barbarism\".<ref name=\"Christine\"/>\n\nThe unblemished musculature of the central figure waving to the rescue ship is reminiscent of the Neoclassical, however the naturalism of light and shadow, the authenticity of the desperation shown by the survivors and the emotional character of the composition differentiate it from Neoclassical austerity. It was a further departure from the religious or classical themes of earlier works because it depicted contemporary events with ordinary and unheroic figures. Both the choice of subject matter and the heightened manner in which the dramatic moment is depicted are typical of Romantic painting\u2014strong indications of the extent to which G\u00e9ricault had moved from the prevalent Neoclassical movement.<ref name=\"Wilkin\"/>\n\nHubert Wellington said that while Delacroix was a lifelong admirer of Gros, the dominating enthusiasm of his youth was for G\u00e9ricault. The dramatic composition of G\u00e9ricault, with its strong contrasts of tone and unconventional gestures, stimulated Delacroix to trust his own creative impulses on a large work. Delacroix said, \"G\u00e9ricault allowed me to see his ''Raft of Medusa'' while he was still working on it.\"<ref name=Wellingtonxi/> The painting's influence is seen in Delacroix's ''[[The Barque of Dante]]'' (1822) and reappears as inspiration in Delacroix's later works, such as ''The Shipwreck of Don Juan'' (1840).<ref name=\"N14\" />\n\n[[File:Delacroix barque of dante 1822 louvre 189cmx246cm 950px.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]], ''[[The Barque of Dante]]'', 1822. ''The Raft of the Medusa'''s influence on the work of the young Delacroix was immediately apparent in this painting, as well as in later works.<ref name=\"N14\" />]]\n\nAccording to Wellington, Delacroix's masterpiece of 1830, ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'', springs directly from G\u00e9ricault's ''The Raft of the Medusa'' and Delacroix's own ''[[The Massacre at Chios|Massacre at Chios]]''. Wellington wrote that \"While G\u00e9ricault carried his interest in actual detail to the point of searching for more survivors from the wreck as models, Delacroix felt his composition more vividly as a whole, thought of his figures and crowds as types, and dominated them by the symbolic figure of Republican Liberty which is one of his finest plastic inventions.\"<ref>Wellington, xv</ref>\n<br>\nThe art and sculpture historian Albert Elsen believed that ''The Raft of the Medusa'' and Delacroix's  ''Massacre at Chios'' provided the inspiration for the grandiose sweep of [[Auguste Rodin]]'s monumental sculpture ''[[The Gates of Hell]]''. He wrote that \"Delacroix's ''Massacre at Chios'' and G\u00e9ricault's ''Raft of the Medusa'' confronted Rodin on a heroic scale with the innocent nameless victims of political tragedies&nbsp;...

Consequently, it is theorised that this is a result of a later possible misinterpretation during the Heian period that the Yatagarasu and the Chinese ''Yangwu'' refer to an identical entity.\n\n==Korea==\n[[Image:Korean three-legged bird mural.jpg|thumb|left|Three-legged crow flanked by dragon and phoenix. Mural from the Korean [[Goguryeo]] period.]]\n\nIn [[Korean mythology]], it is known as '''Samjogo''' ([[hangul]]: {{lang|ko|\uc0bc\uc871\uc624}}; [[hanja]]: {{lang|ko-Hant|\u4e09\u8db3\u70cf}}). During the period of the [[Goguryo]] kingdom, the Samjok-o was considered a symbol of the sun. The ancient Goguryo people thought that a three-legged crow lived in the sun while a turtle lived in the moon. Samjok-o was a highly regarded symbol of power, thought superior to both the [[Korean dragon|dragon]] and the Korean [[fenghuang|bonghwang]].\n\nAlthough the Samjok-o is mainly considered the symbol of [[Goguryeo]], it is also found in [[Goryeo]] and [[Joseon]] dynasty.\n\nIn modern Korea, Samjok-o is still found especially in dramas such as [[Jumong (TV series)|Jumong]]. The three-legged crow was one of several emblems under consideration to replace the ''[[bonghwang]]'' in the Korean seal of state when its revision was considered in 2008.<ref>[http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200601/200601160004.html \"Three-Legged Bird to Replace Phoenix on State Seal,\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060118055234/http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200601/200601160004.html |date=2006-01-18 }} ''Chosun Ilbo'' (Seoul). January 16, 2006.</ref> The Samjok-o appears also in [[Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors FC]]'s current emblem.

On the tibia the component is flat, although it sometimes has a stem which goes down inside the bone for further stability. A flattened or slightly dished [[high-density polyethylene]] surface is then inserted onto the tibial component so that the weight is transferred metal to plastic not metal to metal.

The knee is generally divided into three \"compartments\": ''medial'', ''lateral'', and ''patellofemoral''. Most people with arthritis severe enough to consider knee replacement have significant wear in two or more of the above compartments, and are treated with total knee replacement (TKA). A minority of people with osteoarthritis have wear primarily in one compartment, usually the medial, and may be candidates for unicompartmental knee replacement. Advantages of UKA compared to TKA include smaller incision, easier post-op rehabilitation, better postoperative range of motion, shorter hospital stay, less blood loss, lower risk of infection, stiffness, and [[blood clot]]s, but a harder revision if necessary.

Much of this is dependent on pre-operative function. Most patients can achieve 0\u2013110 degrees, but stiffness of the joint can occur. In some situations, manipulation of the knee under anesthetic is used to reduce post operative stiffness. There are also many implants from manufacturers that are designed to be \"high-flex\" knees, offering a greater range of motion.\n\n===Instability===\nIn some patients, the kneecap dislocates to the outer side of the knee after surgery. This is painful and usually needs to be treated by surgery to realign the kneecap. However, this is quite rare.\n\n===Loosening===\nLoosening of the prosthesis can be indicated on [[Projectional radiography|X-ray]] by thin radiolucent spaces around the implant, or more obviously by implant displacement.<ref name=\"Cyteval2016\">{{cite journal|last1=Cyteval|first1=C.|title=Imaging of knee implants and related complications|journal=Diagnostic and Interventional Imaging|volume=97|issue=7\u20138|year=2016|pages=809\u2013821|issn=22115684|doi=10.1016/j.diii.2016.02.015|pmid=27423710}}</ref>\n\n===Infection===\nThe current classification of AAOS divides prosthetic infections into four types.<ref name=\"pmid16958480\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Leone JM, Hanssen AD |title=Management of infection at the site of a total knee arthroplasty |journal=Instr Course Lect |volume=55 |pages=449\u201361 |year=2006 |pmid=16958480 |doi=}}</ref>\n* Type 1 (positive intraoperative culture): Two positive intraoperative cultures\n* Type 2 (early postoperative infection): Infection occurring within first month after surgery\n* Type 3 (acute hematogenous infection): Hematogenous seeding of site of previously well-functioning prosthesis\n* Type 4 (late chronic infection): Chronic indolent clinical course; infection present for more than a month\n\nWhile it is relatively rare, periprosthetic infection remains one of the most challenging complications of joint arthroplasty.\nA detailed clinical history and physical remain the most reliable tool to recognize a potential periprosthetic infection.

On the tibia the component is flat, although it sometimes has a stem which goes down inside the bone for further stability. A flattened or slightly dished [[high-density polyethylene]] surface is then inserted onto the tibial component so that the weight is transferred metal to plastic not metal to metal. During the operation any deformities must be corrected, and the ligaments balanced so that the knee has a good range of movement and is stable and aligned. In some cases the articular surface of the patella is also removed and replaced by a polyethylene button cemented to the posterior surface of the patella.

The knee is generally divided into three \"compartments\": ''medial'', ''lateral'', and ''patellofemoral''. Most people with arthritis severe enough to consider knee replacement have significant wear in two or more of the above compartments, and are treated with total knee replacement (TKA). A minority of people with osteoarthritis have wear primarily in one compartment, usually the medial, and may be candidates for unicompartmental knee replacement. Advantages of UKA compared to TKA include smaller incision, easier post-op rehabilitation, better postoperative range of motion, shorter hospital stay, less blood loss, lower risk of infection, stiffness, and [[blood clot]]s, but a harder revision if necessary. Persons with infectious or inflammatory arthritis ([[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[lupus erythematosus|lupus]], [[psoriasis]]), or marked deformity are not candidates for this procedure.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=U4u9BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA203&lpg=PA203&dq=partial+knee+replacement+Persons+with+infectious+or+inflammatory+arthritis+(rheumatoid+arthritis,+lupus,+psoriasis),+or+marked+deformity+are+not+candidates+for+this+procedure#v=onepage&q=partial%20knee%20replacement%20Persons%20with%20infectious%20or%20inflammatory%20arthritis%20(rheumatoid%20arthritis,%20lupus,%20psoriasis),%20or%20marked%20deformity%20are%20not%20candidates%20for%20this%20procedure&f=false|title=Design of Artificial Human Joints & Organs|last=Pal|first=Subrata|date=2013-08-31|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-4614-6255-2|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Components and zones==\n{{anchor|KS zones}}[[File:Knee prosthesis zones by Knee Society 2015, lateral view.jpg|thumb|150px|KS (Knee Society) zones, lateral view.<ref name=\"MeneghiniMont2015\">{{cite journal|last1=Meneghini|first1=R.

It was released on June 17, 2008 by [[Capitol Records]]. During its production, Perry was dropped from two record labels and went through two canceled albums. She collaborated with producers [[Greg Wells]], [[Dr. Luke]], [[David A. Stewart]], and [[Max Martin]], among others, on the album, and wrote all of its songs with assistance of other producers and writers. The [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Ur So Gay (EP)|Ur So Gay]]'', containing the [[Ur So Gay|promotional single of the same name]], was released to generate interest in the singer and the album.\n\nAs well as being her first record on a major label, ''One of the Boys'' is Perry's international debut as well as her debut under the new stage name Katy Perry. It succeeds ''[[Katy Hudson (album)|Katy Hudson]]'', which was released under her real name on [[Pamplin Music|Red Hill Records]]. The album received a mixed reception from critics, with some deeming it as being filled with \"potential hits\" and others criticizing Perry's vocal performance. Commercially, it debuted at number nine on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling over 47,000 copies in its first week of sales, and also peaked within the top-ten charts in Austria, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, and Switzerland. ''One of the Boys'' earned Perry two [[Grammy Award]] nominations, and has sold 7 million copies worldwide, being her 2nd highest-selling album to date. It has been certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].\n\nThe album's lead single \"[[I Kissed a Girl]]\" became Perry's first [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number-one single; the second single \"[[Hot n Cold]]\" reached number three in the United States, while topping the charts in Germany, Canada, the Netherlands, and Austria. The third single \"[[Thinking of You (Katy Perry song)|Thinking of You]]\" reached the top-thirty in the US, while the final single \"[[Waking Up in Vegas]]\" became a top-ten hit. To further promote the album, Perry embarked on three tours: the 2008 [[Warped Tour]], her first solo world tour, the [[Hello Katy Tour]], and served as an opening act in [[No Doubt]]'s [[2009 Summer Tour]].\n\n==Background==\nPerry's change in record label, and adoption of a pseudonymous surname accompanied a shift from the Christian rock of her debut album ''[[Katy Hudson (album)|Katy Hudson]]''.<ref>[http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/articles/news/One_Of_The_Boys/30669/p1/ \"One of the Boys: Pop singer Katy Perry talks about her forthcoming album\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615020058/http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/articles/news/One_Of_The_Boys/30669/p1/ |date=June 15, 2008 }}.

It was released on June 17, 2008 by [[Capitol Records]]. During its production, Perry was dropped from two record labels and went through two canceled albums. She collaborated with producers [[Greg Wells]], [[Dr. Luke]], [[David A. Stewart]], and [[Max Martin]], among others, on the album, and wrote all of its songs with assistance of other producers and writers. The [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Ur So Gay (EP)|Ur So Gay]]'', containing the [[Ur So Gay|promotional single of the same name]], was released to generate interest in the singer and the album.\n\nAs well as being her first record on a major label,''One of the Boys'' is Perry's international debut as well as her debut under the new stage name Katy Perry. It succeeds ''[[Katy Hudson (album)|Katy Hudson]]'', which was released under her real name on [[Pamplin Music|Red Hill Records]]. The album received a mixed reception from critics, with some deeming it as being filled with \"potential hits\" and others criticizing Perry's vocal performance. Commercially, it debuted at number nine on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling over 47,000 copies in its first week of sales, and also peaked within the top-ten charts in Austria, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, and Switzerland. ''One of the Boys'' earned Perry two [[Grammy Award]] nominations, and has sold 7 million copies worldwide, being her 2nd highest-selling album to date. It has been certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].\n\nThe album's lead single \"[[I Kissed a Girl]]\" became Perry's first [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number-one single; the second single \"[[Hot n Cold]]\" reached number three in the United States, while topping the charts in Germany, Canada, the Netherlands, and Austria. The third single \"[[Thinking of You (Katy Perry song)|Thinking of You]]\" reached the top-thirty in the US, while the final single \"[[Waking Up in Vegas]]\" became a top-ten hit. To further promote the album, Perry embarked on three tours: the 2008 [[Warped Tour]], her first solo world tour, the [[Hello Katy Tour]], and served as an opening act in [[No Doubt]]'s [[2009 Summer Tour]].\n\n==Background==\nPerry's change in record label, and adoption of a pseudonymous surname accompanied a shift from the Christian rock of her debut album ''[[Katy Hudson (album)|Katy Hudson]]''.<ref>[http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/articles/news/One_Of_The_Boys/30669/p1/ \"One of the Boys: Pop singer Katy Perry talks about her forthcoming album\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615020058/http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/articles/news/One_Of_The_Boys/30669/p1/ |date=June 15, 2008 }}.

Together with Max Martin they wrote and cut \"[[I Kissed a Girl]]\" and \"[[Hot n Cold]]\". Perry then collaborated again with Greg Wells, who she had also worked with on the Columbia album, creating the songs \"[[Ur So Gay]]\" and \"Mannequin\".

Siddharth falls for a door-to-door beautician, Meera ([[Ritu Varma]]). He proposes to her and she accepts. Kallis has a crush on Meera's friend, Shreya ([[Niranjani Ahathian]]). The guys spend their money and soon realise they are running low. This is when it is shown that they are frauds, who use online shopping scams to earn money.\n\nACP Pratap Chakravarthy ([[Gautham Vasudev Menon]]) investigate these scam when the laptop his daughter uses explodes. He realizes that the scammers use the addresses of abandoned houses to receive the delivered products and public wifi to sell them online. Siddharth changes their plan and now the boys loot expensive items from luxurious cars. They make enough money worth about 6 lakhs. Pratap closes down on them when the boys steal his friend's laptop but the boys escape successfully. Meera calls Siddharth and informs them that her handbag was snatched. She cries that though only 3000Rs was stolen, it was hard-earned money. Siddharth feels guilty and the guys decide to drop the ill-earned way of surviving.\n\nThey decide to settle in Goa by starting a restaurant with the money and shift to Goa. Pratap tracks down the boys address only to find the house vacated. He soon follows them to Goa. It is then shown that Pratap was actually trying to find Meera and Shreya, who are even bigger frauds than Siddharth and Kallis. He informs them that the girls motive is to make guys fall for them and loot money from them. Siddharath and Kallis find their money bag missing and are disappointed that the girls cheated them when they truly loved them.\n\nThey hitchhike to Chennai and slowly use their 'criminal' minds to find the girls. They find out that they are in Delhi. Pratap also finds that the girls are at Delhi, with Meera in the identity of a girl named Ishita. Shocked the girls return the bag of money and asks them to leave when Siddharth proposes that they form a team and share the amount they stole. It is also revealed that Meera's real name is Madhumitha and Shreya's real name is Varsha. Madhu agrees to Siddharth's deal. They shortlist a rich old businessman, Sooraj Mehta ([[Anish Yohan Kuruvilla]]), who eyes Madhu (as Ishita) in mediation class. Varsha also befriends Sooraj's wife in gym.\n\nThe guys, using their technological brain, slowly break down Sooraj's security features in the villa. Using a spycam in Madhu's phone and a voice recorder designed as a bracelet, they realize that he is a drug dealer, who has 1 Crore USD in his house, which is equivalent to 71 Crore RS. When the others decide to play safe by dropping the plan, Siddharth convinces them.\n\nThey plan to enter the garage in Sooraj's house using his Rolls Royce. They also get his fingerprint to enter the locker room using a 3D printer. As per Siddharth's plan, Varsha is to spend 2hr of shopping with Sooraj's wife. Madhu is to spend time with Sooraj. When Sooraj's car is parked in Hyatt Hotel car parking, Siddharth and Kallis would take the car and enter Sooraj's compound, but they will not be seen as the car is tinted. But there comes a change in their plan when Sooraj drives to his private guesthouse instead of Hyatt Hotel, to the surprise of Madhu(Ishitha) and the others. Shocked, the guys follow the car to a suburban area. Madhu is inside with Sooraj and the guys have only 1hr time.\n\nSiddharth tells Kallis that Sooraj's car is advanced and can be hacked. He opens the app and surprisingly drives the car out of the guesthouse. They drive to Sooraj's house and safely enter the garage but finds out that to enter the other garage side, a pattern is required. Siddharth asks Madhu to find out Sooraj's phone pattern and the guys successfully enter the garage. With the 3D printed thumbprint, the enter the locker room, open the locker and steal the money. Madhu fakes her faint attack and nosebleed and Sooraj rushes her to the hospital, and the guys park the car just in time for Sooraj to leave with an 'unconscious' Madhu. When Sooraj goes in to bring the doctors, Madhu escapes.\n\nSiddharth says that they are going to Thailand by road and the pairs set off on their bikes. They encounter Pratap doing checkings and Siddharth devises a plan quickly. Before the guys leave to confuse Pratap, the girls reveal that they have fallen in love with them. Happily, the guys rush off and confuse Pratap that the girls are escaping in a white car. Pratap, thinking it is true, assumes that they are going to the airport. He breaches the airport security and the guys escape.\n\nSiddharth and Kallis call Madhu and tell that they have all the money the bags in the bikes are all empty and it is their time to take revenge and cheat them and tell that the police will be there in a few minutes, shocked and devastated girls not feel like running away as they deserve this for cheating truly loving Sid and Kallis just then-Police vehicle enters the hideout and Sid and Kallis get out of that and say that they are just messing around and say that they think the girls have really started loving them and both couples reconcile and decide to settle in life. Back in Chennai, Pratap questioned by the CBI for breaching security. His higher official scolds him for abandoning a checking assigned to him and going after two girls who are cheaters. In a small flashback, it is shown that Pratap was also a victim of Madhu's scams, and a mini-scene replicating a scene from Gautam Vasudev Menon's hit romantic film [[Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa]] is shown.

Siddharth falls for a door-to-door beautician, Meera ([[Ritu Varma]]). He proposes to her and she accepts. Kallis has a crush on Meera's friend, Shreya ([[Niranjani Ahathian]]). The guys spend their money and soon realise they are running low. This is when it is shown that they are frauds, who use online shopping scams to earn money.\n\nACP Pratap Chakravarthy ([[Gautham Vasudev Menon]]) investigate these scam when the laptop his daughter uses explodes. He realizes that the scammers use the addresses of abandoned houses to receive the delivered products and public wifi to sell them online. Siddharth changes their plan and now the boys loot expensive items from luxurious cars. They make enough money worth about 6 lakhs. Pratap closes down on them when the boys steal his friend's laptop but the boys escape successfully. Meera calls Siddharth and informs them that her handbag was snatched. She cries that though only 3000Rs was stolen, it was hard-earned money. Siddharth feels guilty and the guys decide to drop the ill-earned way of surviving.\n\nThey decide to settle in Goa by starting a restaurant with the money and shift to Goa. Pratap tracks down the boys address only to find the house vacated. He soon follows them to Goa. It is then shown that Pratap was actually trying to find Meera and Shreya, who are even bigger frauds than Siddharth and Kallis. He informs them that the girls motive is to make guys fall for them and loot money from them. Siddharath and Kallis find their money bag missing and are disappointed that the girls cheated them when they truly loved them.\n\nThey hitchhike to Chennai and slowly use their 'criminal' minds to find the girls. They find out that they are in Delhi. Pratap also finds that the girls are at Delhi, with Meera in the identity of a girl named Ishita. Shocked the girls return the bag of money and asks them to leave when Siddharth proposes that they form a team and share the amount they stole. It is also revealed that Meera's real name is Madhumitha and Shreya's real name is Varsha. Madhu agrees to Siddharth's deal. They shortlist a rich old businessman, Sooraj Mehta ([[Anish Yohan Kuruvilla]]), who eyes Madhu (as Ishita) in mediation class. Varsha also befriends Sooraj's wife in gym.\n\nThe guys, using their technological brain, slowly break down Sooraj's security features in the villa. Using a spycam in Madhu's phone and a voice recorder designed as a bracelet, they realize that he is a drug dealer, who has 1 Crore USD in his house, which is equivalent to 71 Crore RS. When the others decide to play safe by dropping the plan, Siddharth convinces them.\n\nThey plan to enter the garage in Sooraj's house using his Rolls Royce. They also get his fingerprint to enter the locker room using a 3D printer. As per Siddharth's plan, Varsha is to spend 2hr of shopping with Sooraj's wife. Madhu is to spend time with Sooraj. When Sooraj's car is parked in Hyatt Hotel car parking, Siddharth and Kallis would take the car and enter Sooraj's compound, but they will not be seen as the car is tinted. But there comes a change in their plan when Sooraj drives to his private guesthouse instead of Hyatt Hotel, to the surprise of Madhu(Ishitha) and the others. Shocked, the guys follow the car to a suburban area. Madhu is inside with Sooraj and the guys have only 1hr time.\n\nSiddharth tells Kallis that Sooraj's car is advanced and can be hacked. He opens the app and surprisingly drives the car out of the guesthouse. They drive to Sooraj's house and safely enter the garage but finds out that to enter the other garage side, a pattern is required. Siddharth asks Madhu to find out Sooraj's phone pattern and the guys successfully enter the garage. With the 3D printed thumbprint, the enter the locker room, open the locker and steal the money. Madhu fakes her faint attack and nosebleed and Sooraj rushes her to the hospital, and the guys park the car just in time for Sooraj to leave with an 'unconscious' Madhu. When Sooraj goes in to bring the doctors, Madhu escapes.\n\nSiddharth says that they are going to Thailand by road and the pairs set off on their bikes. They encounter Pratap doing checkings and Siddharth devises a plan quickly. Before the guys leave to confuse Pratap, the girls reveal that they have fallen in love with them. Happily, the guys rush off and confuse Pratap that the girls are escaping in a white car. Pratap, thinking it is true, assumes that they are going to the airport. He breaches the airport security and the guys escape.\n\nSiddharth and Kallis call Madhu and tell that they have all the money the bags in the bikes are all empty and it is their time to take revenge and cheat them and tell that the police will be there in a few minutes, shocked and devastated girls not feel like running away as they deserve this for cheating truly loving Sid and Kallis just then-Police vehicle enters the hideout and Sid and Kallis get out of that and say that they are just messing around and say that they think the girls have really started loving them and both couples reconcile and decide to settle in life. Back in Chennai, Pratap questioned by the CBI for breaching security. His higher official scolds him for abandoning a checking assigned to him and going after two girls who are cheaters. In a small flashback, it is shown that Pratap was also a victim of Madhu's scams, and a mini-scene replicating a scene from Gautam Vasudev Menon's hit romantic film [[Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa]] is shown. Ashamed to declare that he was also a victim, Pratap hangs his head low.\n\nBack at Sooraj's house, he watches a CCTV footage of Siddharth and Kallis stealing the money but their face is hidden. The guys have used infrared flashlights on their caps, which have deceived the camera. The scene shifts to a hilltop in Manipur where the two couples are temporarily staying in tents, enjoying their lives together Siddharth reveals that he has tattoed Madhu's name on his hand shocked Madhu reveals her real name is not Madhu and Varsha reveals her real name is Thenmozhi, then Siddharth reveals that he knew that she will be up to something like this and the tattoo was a fake and they hug and when Siddharth asks her real name Madhu tells him to find it, Kallis's shocked that his girl is a country bumbkin and Thenmozhi makes fun of his name Kalleeswaran and the camera flies up to end credits.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Dulquer Salmaan]] as Siddharth (''Siddhu / Sid'')\n* [[Ritu Varma]] as Kanimozhi (Meera / Madhumitha (''Madhu'') / Ishita / [[Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa|Jessie]])\n* [[Rakshan]] as Kaaleeswaramurthy (''Kallis'')\n* [[Niranjani Ahathian]] as Thenmozhi (Shreya / Varsha)\n* [[Gautham Menon|Gautham Vasudev Menon]] as DCP Prathap Chakravarthi\n* [[Anish Kuruvilla|Anish Yohan Kuruvilla]] as Sooraj Mehta\n*Tiger Thangadurai as Two wheeler mechanic\n*Gajaraj as House owner\n*Baby Monika Siva as Prathap's daughter\n*VJ Jacqueline as Kallis's Friend (Cameo appearance)\n\n== Home Media ==\nThe movie was available to be purchased for $1.99 on Simply South on 19 March 2020 for all countries except for India.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.simplysouth.tv/watch/tamilmovies/kannum-kannum-kollaiyadithal|title=Simply South|website=www.simplysouth.tv|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> The movie was released on [[Netflix]] on 29 March 2020 for all countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.netflix.com/title/81176205|title=Kannum Kannum Kollaiyadithaal {{!}} Netflix|website=www.netflix.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> The Satellite Rights were sold to [[Vijay TV]] which premiered on eve of Tamil New Year on 14 April 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.republicworld.com/entertainment-news/regional-indian-cinema/dulquer-salmaans-tamil-new-year-wishes-comes-with-a-surprise-present|title=Dulquer Salmaan's Tamil New Year wishes come with a pleasant surprise for fans|last=World|first=Republic|website=Republic World|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movies-cinema-news-16/dulquer-salmaan-kannum-kannum-kollaiyadithaal-tamil-new-years-day.html|title=Dulquer Salmaan Kannum Kannum Kollaiyadithaal Tamil New Years Day|date=2020-04-13|website=Behindwoods|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\n===Development===\n[[Dulquer Salmaan]] agreed to collaborate with debutant director Desingh Periyasamy for a Tamil film in February 2017, and chose to make the film before another proposed Tamil film by director Ra.

Over six seasons at the club, Dickov experienced two [[promotion and relegation|promotions]] and two relegations, playing in three different divisions. Dickov left in 2002 to join [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], where he stayed for two seasons and, in 2004, he signed for [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], and was part of the team which qualified for the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] in [[2005\u201306 in English football|2005\u201306]]. Upon the expiry of his Blackburn contract in 2006, he rejoined [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and later went on to play for [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]], [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] and [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]]. In 2000, he made his debut for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], against [[San Marino national football team|San Marino]]. In total he represented his country ten times, scoring one goal.\n\n==Club career==\n===Arsenal===\nBorn in [[Livingston, West Lothian]],<ref name=\"Hugman\"/> Paul started playing football around the age of nine years playing for his local under-11 team Livingston United. Paul continued to play for Livingston United each year and when he played in under-13 this is when he caught the eye of Arsenal Scout Malcolm McGregor.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Dickov joined the youth ranks of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in 1989, before being promoted to the first team in 1990. Under [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] chances were limited for Dickov as he struggled to break into the Arsenal team who were rich in talent with players such as [[Ian Wright]]. He helped the club win the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] in 1994, and beforehand he had been a member of Arsenal's squad during its first season in the [[Premier League]]. Whilst at [[Highbury]] he spent several loan spells at both [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] and [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]]. He left Arsenal in 1996 having made 26 appearances in all competitions, scoring seven goals.\n\n===Manchester City===\nDickov joined [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] on 22 August 1996 in a transfer valued between \u00a3750,000 and \u00a31 million,<ref name=\"James\">{{cite book |last=James |first=Gary |title=Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record |publisher=Breedon |location=Derby |year=2006 |isbn=1-85983-512-0}}p218.</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Paul Dickov| publisher=Manchester City F.C. | url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/default.sps?pagegid=%7B439A001B-9F18-408E-BD8E-8466AB3C97FD%7D&bioid=12712&siteid=502| accessdate=5 April 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928012017/http://www.mcfc.co.uk/default.sps?pagegid=%7B439A001B-9F18-408E-BD8E-8466AB3C97FD%7D&bioid=12712&siteid=502 |archivedate = 28 September 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> the final signing of [[Alan Ball, Jr.|Alan Ball]]'s Manchester City management.

A regular starter under [[Asa Hartford]], [[Steve Coppell]] and [[Phil Neal]], he played less frequently under [[Frank Clark (footballer)|Frank Clark]], and finished the season with five goals from 25 League starts. At the start of the [[1997\u201398 in English football|1997\u201398]] season, Dickov did not feature in the first team, but was restored to the starting line-up following injuries to [[Uwe R\u00f6sler]] and [[Lee Bradbury]]. Dickov finished the season as the City's top scorer with nine goals, but the club were relegated to the third tier of English football for the first time in their history after finishing in 22nd place.\n\nDickov, wearing the number 9 shirt, played a supporting role in a striking partnership with [[Shaun Goater]] in the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] season, scoring 16 goals in all competitions, including a [[hat-trick]] against [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]]. After a slow start, his form improved in the later part of the season, leading to City manager Joe Royle nicknaming him \"the crocus\" due to him coming to life in the spring months.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/dickov-a-mixture-of-light-and-dark-72387.html\n|title=Dickov - A mixture of dark and light \n|publisher = [[the Independent]]\n|date = 9 January 2004}}</ref>\nHe scored an important equaliser against [[Wigan Athletic]] in the play off semi final first leg (which was also the last ever goal to be scored at [[Springfield Park (Wigan)|Springfield Park]]).<ref>{{cite news \n|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-dickov-keeps-city-in-the-hunt-1094115.html\n|title=Dickov keeps City in the hunt\n|publisher=[[the Independent]] \n|date=15 May 1999 |accessdate=19 April 2010\n| location=London\n| first=Dave\n| last=Hadfield}}</ref> The sixteenth goal was particularly crucial, a 15-yard, top corner injury time equaliser in the final of the promotion playoffs against [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]].

[[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]].\n\nDickov played as a [[forward (association football)|forward]] from 1990 to 2011, starting his career with [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], where he won the UEFA Cup Winners Cup in 1994, but often struggled to hold a place in the first team and spent time on loan with [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] and [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] before moving to  [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in 1996 who were then in [[Football League First Division|Division One]]. Over six seasons at the club, Dickov experienced two [[promotion and relegation|promotions]] and two relegations, playing in three different divisions. Dickov left in 2002 to join [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], where he stayed for two seasons and, in 2004, he signed for [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], and was part of the team which qualified for the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] in [[2005\u201306 in English football|2005\u201306]]. Upon the expiry of his Blackburn contract in 2006, he rejoined [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and later went on to play for [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]], [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] and [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]]. In 2000, he made his debut for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], against [[San Marino national football team|San Marino]]. In total he represented his country ten times, scoring one goal.\n\n==Club career==\n===Arsenal===\nBorn in [[Livingston, West Lothian]],<ref name=\"Hugman\"/> Paul started playing football around the age of nine years playing for his local under-11 team Livingston United. Paul continued to play for Livingston United each year and when he played in under-13 this is when he caught the eye of Arsenal Scout Malcolm McGregor.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Dickov joined the youth ranks of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in 1989, before being promoted to the first team in 1990. Under [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] chances were limited for Dickov as he struggled to break into the Arsenal team who were rich in talent with players such as [[Ian Wright]]. He helped the club win the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] in 1994, and beforehand he had been a member of Arsenal's squad during its first season in the [[Premier League]]. Whilst at [[Highbury]] he spent several loan spells at both [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] and [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]]. He left Arsenal in 1996 having made 26 appearances in all competitions, scoring seven goals.\n\n===Manchester City===\nDickov joined [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] on 22 August 1996 in a transfer valued between \u00a3750,000 and \u00a31 million,<ref name=\"James\">{{cite book |last=James |first=Gary |title=Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record |publisher=Breedon |location=Derby |year=2006 |isbn=1-85983-512-0}}p218.</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Paul Dickov| publisher=Manchester City F.C. | url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/default.sps?pagegid=%7B439A001B-9F18-408E-BD8E-8466AB3C97FD%7D&bioid=12712&siteid=502| accessdate=5 April 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928012017/http://www.mcfc.co.uk/default.sps?pagegid=%7B439A001B-9F18-408E-BD8E-8466AB3C97FD%7D&bioid=12712&siteid=502 |archivedate = 28 September 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> the final signing of [[Alan Ball, Jr.|Alan Ball]]'s Manchester City management.

Dickov made his first Manchester City start in the next match, in a 2\u20131 win over [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]].<ref>James, p461</ref> Dickov joined the club in a period of turmoil; in his first season at Manchester City he played under five different managers (three full-time appointments and two caretakers). A regular starter under [[Asa Hartford]], [[Steve Coppell]] and [[Phil Neal]], he played less frequently under [[Frank Clark (footballer)|Frank Clark]], and finished the season with five goals from 25 League starts. At the start of the [[1997\u201398 in English football|1997\u201398]] season, Dickov did not feature in the first team, but was restored to the starting line-up following injuries to [[Uwe R\u00f6sler]] and [[Lee Bradbury]]. Dickov finished the season as the City's top scorer with nine goals, but the club were relegated to the third tier of English football for the first time in their history after finishing in 22nd place.\n\nDickov, wearing the number 9 shirt, played a supporting role in a striking partnership with [[Shaun Goater]] in the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] season, scoring 16 goals in all competitions, including a [[hat-trick]] against [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]].

Television shows based on the character have run on [[British television]] since 1955 and continue to appear to this day.\n\n==Noddy==\nThe first book explains Noddy's origins. He was made by a [[wood carving|woodcarver]] in a toy store but ran away after the man began to make a wooden lion, which scared Noddy. As he wanders through the woods, with no clothes, money or home, he meets [[Big Ears (character)|Big Ears]], a friendly [[gnome]]. Big Ears decides that Noddy is a toy and takes him to live in Toyland. He generously provides Noddy with a set of clothing and a house. While Noddy is quite happy to be a toy, the citizens of Toyland are not sure that he actually is one. They put Noddy on trial and examine whether he is a toy or an ornament. Eventually, Noddy is declared a toy, but still has to convince the court that he is a good toy. The judge accepts that Noddy is good after a doll tells the court that he saved her little girl from a lion, and he is allowed to stay in Toyland. Noddy gets his car in the second book. It is given to him after he helps solve a local mystery.\n \nMany assume that Noddy is a taxi driver of some description, due to the fact that Noddy loves driving his friends around Toyland in his little red and yellow [[Taxicab|taxi]].  However, no actual references are made in the episodes to Noddy's occupation, and so such claims are merely speculation. The other toys can hear him coming by the distinctive \"Parp Parp\" sound of his car's horn and the jingle of the bell on his blue hat. Often he uses his car to visit all of the places in Toyland. When his taxi business is not doing so well, or when he needs help, Noddy turns to Big Ears. Big Ears will often lend him what he needs. On occasion, Noddy will allow people to make his head nod. in exchange for small items such as his morning milk.\n\nNoddy is kind and honest, but he often gets in trouble, either through his own misunderstandings, or because someone, usually one of the naughty goblins Sly or Gobbo, has played a trick on him. He is very childlike in his understanding of the world and often becomes confused as a result. For example, in the first Noddy book, Noddy and Big Ears are building Noddy's house for one. Noddy suggests that they build the roof first, in case it rains. With no understanding of gravity or of the need for roof supports, this is perfectly logical to him. As the series continues, Noddy becomes wiser but without losing his charm and lovable naivety.\n \nNoddy's best friends are Big Ears, Tessie Bear, Bumpy Dog, and the Tubby Bears. Big Ears, who brought Noddy to Toyland, is the most important figure in his life.  Whenever he faces serious peril, it tends to be Big Ears who comes to the rescue, one way or another, and it is invariably Big Ears to whom Noddy turns for support and reassurance.  Big Ears is not so much a parental figure, but more like a guardian, or perhaps Noddy's attorney. While kind to Noddy, Big Ears has an intimidating presence and voice that makes him feared by goblins. He is capable of facing down wizards with his own spells, and is able to plead Noddy's case to [[Mr. Plod]], the local [[policeman]], when Noddy finds himself in legal peril. On rare occasions, however, Big Ears finds himself in trouble, in which case Noddy comes to his aid. Big Ears and Noddy have rarely quarreled seriously. Examples of such quarrels are when Big Ears harshly scolded the very sensitive Tessie Bear for failing to control her dog and when Noddy ran his car into Big Ears's clothes post and then drove away, dragging Big Ears's clean washing behind him.\n\nTessie is a gentle-hearted, gold bear who often wears a bonnet with flowers and a skirt. She is very kind and very loving towards all of her friends and neighbours. Bumpy Dog is Tessie's pet. He loves to run up and \"bump\" people over. Noddy frequently gets annoyed with Bumpy but still likes him. Whenever Noddy threatens Bumpy, Tessie gets upset, and sometimes even begins to cry. The Tubby Bears live next door to Noddy. They are gold and chubby teddy bears. Mr. and Mrs. Tubby Bear frequently help Noddy. It is clear that Mr. and Mrs. Tubby Bear are the superiors of Noddy, as if he were a child. Their first names are never mentioned and Noddy always refers to them as Mr. and Mrs. They have one son, also named Tubby, who is occasionally referred to as Master Tubby. Tubby is naughty and is usually in trouble for breaking rules, being rude, or doing something wrong. Noddy often attempts to scold or punish Tubby, with little result. On one occasion, Tubby gets tired of always being bossed around and being punished and decides to run away to sea. Noddy and Bumpy accidentally join with him. By the end of the journey, Tubby misses his parents and brings them back presents from his trip, as an apology.\n\nNoddy is a bad name and I do not like this tv show\n\n==Characters==\n===Major characters===\n* '''Tessie Bear''', a clever and kind female [[teddy bear]] who is Noddy's best friend.

There were numerous spin-offs, also. Widely differing estimates can be found.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/further-adventures-of-the-famous-five-1360427.html|title=Further adventures of the Famous Five|accessdate=16 November 2018|date=26 October 1996}}</ref>\n\nThe 24 original Noddy books by Enid Blyton were published between 1949 and 1963. Harmsen Van der Beek illustrated the first 7 Noddy books.  After Beek's death in 1953 the original style was maintained by illustrators Robert Tyndall, Peter Wienk, Mary Brooks and Robert Lee.\n\nSales of Noddy books are large, with an estimated 600,000 annual sales in France alone, and growing popularity in India, a large market for Blyton books. The Noddy character was formerly owned by [[Chorion (company)|Chorion]], who sold the rights on to [[DreamWorks Classics]] (a part of [[DreamWorks Animation]] which now a subsidiary of [[NBCUniversal]]) in 2012.\n\n#''[[Noddy Goes to Toyland]]'' (1949)\n#''Hurrah for Little Noddy'' (1950)\n#''Noddy and His Car'' (1951)\n#''Here Comes Noddy Again!''

The production was presented by Clarion Productions. The production was written and directed by [[David Wood (actor)|David Wood]] with scene and costume designs by Susie Calcutt. The original cast included [[Eric Potts]] as Big Ears and [[Karen Briffett]] as Noddy. The show was very well received among critics, audiences and even [[Enid Blyton]]'s daughter [[Gillian Baverstock]]. [[David Wood (actor)|David Wood]] adapted a successful sequel to the play entitled \"Noddy and the Tootle\" which opened at the [[Wimbledon Theatre]] and endured on a long UK National Tour in 1995\u20131996. [[Karen Briffett]] reprised her role as Noddy and Big Ears was played by [[Jonathan Broxholme]]. This production was too presented by Clarion Productions.\n\nThe characters returned between September 2002 and January 2004 for a [[computer animation|computer-animated]] series, which was eventually named ''[[Make Way for Noddy]]''. This was created by [[Chorion (company)|Chorion]], in association with SD Entertainment and the 100 episodes were produced in 2001 externally. It originally aired in 12-minute segments as part of the ''[[Milkshake!]]'' programme on Britain's [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]].\n\nIn the autumn of 2004, a set of 100 new two-minute [[TV interstitial]]s were created by Chorion. These interstitials, entitled ''Say it With Noddy'', feature Noddy learning words in a variety of foreign languages. They also introduced Noddy's new friend Whizz from Robot Village, who presses a button on his chest to play recordings of native speakers saying the new foreign words Noddy was to learn. The interstitials were featured on commercial breaks on Five and featured as segments for the American release of the show on PBS.\n\nA CG animated series, called ''Noddy in Toyland'', was made in 2009 by [[Chorion]], produced by [[Brown Bag Films]] in Ireland. The series features much more detailed faces for Big Ears and Mr. Plod, a new wardrobe for Tessie Bear, and incorporates Whizz as a full-time character. Sly and Gobbo's cousins, Sneaky and Stealth, are introduced and usually work alongside them. The full series is available digitally on [[iTunes]].\n\nIn 2012, Chorion sold the Noddy character to ClassicMedia, which in turn was bought out by DreamWorks Animation, leading to another CG animated series, named ''Noddy, Toyland Detective'' was produced by French producer/distributor [[Gaumont Animation]], in association with [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks Animation Television]], and in partnership with [[France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions]].

Noddy was illustrated by the Dutch artist [[Eelco Martinus ten Harmsen van der Beek]] from 1949 until his death in 1953, after which the work was continued by [[Peter Wienk]]. Television shows based on the character have run on [[British television]] since 1955 and continue to appear to this day.\n\n==Noddy==\nThe first book explains Noddy's origins. He was made by a [[wood carving|woodcarver]] in a toy store but ran away after the man began to make a wooden lion, which scared Noddy. As he wanders through the woods, with no clothes, money or home, he meets [[Big Ears (character)|Big Ears]], a friendly [[gnome]]. Big Ears decides that Noddy is a toy and takes him to live in Toyland. He generously provides Noddy with a set of clothing and a house. While Noddy is quite happy to be a toy, the citizens of Toyland are not sure that he actually is one. They put Noddy on trial and examine whether he is a toy or an ornament. Eventually, Noddy is declared a toy, but still has to convince the court that he is a good toy. The judge accepts that Noddy is good after a doll tells the court that he saved her little girl from a lion, and he is allowed to stay in Toyland. Noddy gets his car in the second book. It is given to him after he helps solve a local mystery.\n \nMany assume that Noddy is a taxi driver of some description, due to the fact that Noddy loves driving his friends around Toyland in his little red and yellow [[Taxicab|taxi]].  However, no actual references are made in the episodes to Noddy's occupation, and so such claims are merely speculation. The other toys can hear him coming by the distinctive \"Parp Parp\" sound of his car's horn and the jingle of the bell on his blue hat. Often he uses his car to visit all of the places in Toyland. When his taxi business is not doing so well, or when he needs help, Noddy turns to Big Ears. Big Ears will often lend him what he needs. On occasion, Noddy will allow people to make his head nod. in exchange for small items such as his morning milk.\n\nNoddy is kind and honest, but he often gets in trouble, either through his own misunderstandings, or because someone, usually one of the naughty goblins Sly or Gobbo, has played a trick on him. He is very childlike in his understanding of the world and often becomes confused as a result. For example, in the first Noddy book, Noddy and Big Ears are building Noddy's house for one. Noddy suggests that they build the roof first, in case it rains. With no understanding of gravity or of the need for roof supports, this is perfectly logical to him. As the series continues, Noddy becomes wiser but without losing his charm and lovable naivety.\n \nNoddy's best friends are Big Ears, Tessie Bear, Bumpy Dog, and the Tubby Bears. Big Ears, who brought Noddy to Toyland, is the most important figure in his life.  Whenever he faces serious peril, it tends to be Big Ears who comes to the rescue, one way or another, and it is invariably Big Ears to whom Noddy turns for support and reassurance.  Big Ears is not so much a parental figure, but more like a guardian, or perhaps Noddy's attorney. While kind to Noddy, Big Ears has an intimidating presence and voice that makes him feared by goblins. He is capable of facing down wizards with his own spells, and is able to plead Noddy's case to [[Mr. Plod]], the local [[policeman]], when Noddy finds himself in legal peril. On rare occasions, however, Big Ears finds himself in trouble, in which case Noddy comes to his aid. Big Ears and Noddy have rarely quarreled seriously. Examples of such quarrels are when Big Ears harshly scolded the very sensitive Tessie Bear for failing to control her dog and when Noddy ran his car into Big Ears's clothes post and then drove away, dragging Big Ears's clean washing behind him.\n\nTessie is a gentle-hearted, gold bear who often wears a bonnet with flowers and a skirt. She is very kind and very loving towards all of her friends and neighbours. Bumpy Dog is Tessie's pet. He loves to run up and \"bump\" people over. Noddy frequently gets annoyed with Bumpy but still likes him. Whenever Noddy threatens Bumpy, Tessie gets upset, and sometimes even begins to cry. The Tubby Bears live next door to Noddy. They are gold and chubby teddy bears. Mr. and Mrs. Tubby Bear frequently help Noddy. It is clear that Mr. and Mrs. Tubby Bear are the superiors of Noddy, as if he were a child. Their first names are never mentioned and Noddy always refers to them as Mr. and Mrs. They have one son, also named Tubby, who is occasionally referred to as Master Tubby. Tubby is naughty and is usually in trouble for breaking rules, being rude, or doing something wrong. Noddy often attempts to scold or punish Tubby, with little result. On one occasion, Tubby gets tired of always being bossed around and being punished and decides to run away to sea. Noddy and Bumpy accidentally join with him. By the end of the journey, Tubby misses his parents and brings them back presents from his trip, as an apology.\n\nNoddy has many runs with Mr. Plod. Some are caused by Noddy's lack of understanding of how Toyland works. Other times it is because of a case of mistaken identity, Mr. Plod is generally long-suffering towards Noddy and Noddy likes Mr. Plod and frequently goes out of his way to help him. Mr. Plod often catches the mischief makers on his police bicycle, by blowing his whistle and shouting \"Halt in the name of Plod!!\" before locking the culprits up in his jail.\n\n==Characters==\n===Major characters===\n* '''Tessie Bear''', a clever and kind female [[teddy bear]] who is Noddy's best friend. She has not been featured in the franchise since 2009.\n* '''[[Big Ears (character)|Big Ears]]''', a wise, bearded [[gnome]] who lives in a toadstool house outside of Toyland and is Noddy's helper and father figure. He finds Noddy and brings him to Toyland at the start of the first book. Big Ears, while usually kind to Noddy, can be very fierce and is both feared and respected by goblins, wizards, and even Mr. Plod. Whenever Noddy is being mistreated, he invariably comes to his defence.  Big Ears also has the power to cast magic spells, though he rarely uses it. His catchphrase is \"You funny little Noddy!\u201d\n*'''Dinah Doll''', a [[china doll]] who sells all kinds of everything in the market. A later addition, not in the original books.

His catchphrase is \"Stop in the name of Plod!\u201d\n* '''Bumpy Dog''', in the original books. lives with Tessie Bear, but accompanies Noddy on many adventures.

(He has not been featured in the franchise since 1999)\n* '''Mrs. Tubby Bear''', Noddy's next door neighbour.

First name is Fiona. (She has not been featured in the franchise since 1999).\n* '''Teddy Tubby Bear''', Mr Tubby Bear's brother, Mrs Tubby Bear's brother-in-law and Master Tubby Bear's uncle, who appeared in the third book, ''Noddy and His Car''.\n*'''Mr. Golly''', in the books was the [[owner]] of the Toyland garage.

The total number is hard to count: the ''Noddy Library'' (Sampson Low) of two dozen titles, which became the ''New Noddy Library'' when revised, was just part of a big production in the 1950s, with ''Big Noddy Books'' of larger format, and strip books. There were numerous spin-offs, also. Widely differing estimates can be found.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/further-adventures-of-the-famous-five-1360427.html|title=Further adventures of the Famous Five|accessdate=16 November 2018|date=26 October 1996}}</ref>\n\nThe 24 original Noddy books by Enid Blyton were published between 1949 and 1963. Harmsen Van der Beek illustrated the first 7 Noddy books.  After Beek's death in 1953 the original style was maintained by illustrators Robert Tyndall, Peter Wienk, Mary Brooks and Robert Lee.\n\nSales of Noddy books are large, with an estimated 600,000 annual sales in France alone, and growing popularity in India, a large market for Blyton books. The Noddy character was formerly owned by [[Chorion (company)|Chorion]], who sold the rights on to [[DreamWorks Classics]] (a part of [[DreamWorks Animation]] which now a subsidiary of [[NBCUniversal]]) in 2012.\n\n#''[[Noddy Goes to Toyland]]'' (1949)\n#''Hurrah for Little Noddy'' (1950)\n#''Noddy and His Car'' (1951)\n#''Here Comes Noddy Again!''

''Noddy and the Farmyard Muddle'' (2009) was illustrated by Robert Tyndall, who has drawn the characters in the Noddy books since 1953,<ref>{{Citation | contribution-url = http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7732869.stm | title = News vote | contribution = Noddy returning for 60th birthday | publisher = BBC | place = United Kingdom}}</ref> ever since the death of the original illustrator, [[Harmsen van der Beek]].\n\n==Television adaptations productions and incarnations==\nIn the 1990s and early 2000s TV series adaptation, as well as a new series of books, Noddy has been updated, with the original Golliwog characters replaced by other sorts of toys. For example, Mr. Golly who ran the Toyland garage was replaced by Frenchman Monsieur Polly in the 1975 series, and later on Mr. Sparks who in the new 2002 version of the series appears to be Scottish, and Dinah Doll, described as \"a black, assertive minority female\",{{by whom|date=January 2020}} was added to the franchise by the [[BBC]] during the [[Noddy's Toyland Adventures|1992\u20131999 series]].\n\n*''[[The Adventures of Noddy]]'' (1955)\n*''[[The Further Adventures of Noddy]]'' (1963)\n*''[[Noddy (1975 TV series)|Noddy]]'' (1975\u20131976) - A series produced for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] by [[Cosgrove Hall Films]]\n*''[[Noddy's Toyland Adventures]]'' (1992\u20132000) - The BBC's first adaptation of the Noddy franchise, and by far the most well known version.\n*''[[Noddy (TV series)|Noddy]]'' (1998\u20132000) - Canadian/American adaptation featuring redubbed animations from Noddy's Toyland Adventures, released in other English speaking territories as \"Noddy in Toyland\"\n*''[[Make Way for Noddy]]'' (2002\u20132007)\n*''[[Noddy in Toyland]]'' (2009)\n*''[[Noddy, Toyland Detective]]'' (2016-Present)\n\n==Adaptations==\n[[Image:Noddyatstoll.jpg|thumb|Programme of ''Noddy in Toyland'' at the Stoll Theatre, London]]\nNoddy first appeared on stage at the 2660-seat [[Stoll Theatre]] in [[Kingsway (London)|Kingsway]], London, in 1954. The very large cast were all children or teenagers, mostly from the [[Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts|Italia Conti acting school]]. There was a full theatre orchestra. The finale was a scene at the \"Faraway Tree\", with many of the children dressed as fairies, flying on wires. It ran for several years, but the Stoll was knocked down and replaced by an office block in the late 1950s.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1954-12-24-03-007&pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1954-12-24-03 | title = Noddy in Toyland at the Stoll | newspaper = The Times | date = 24 December 1954 | place = UK}}.</ref> The [[Peacock Theatre]] was built in the basement of the new building, but Noddy did not return.\n\nIn 1963, Noddy was featured in the animated short film ''Noddy Goes to Toyland'', it was produced by [[Arthur Humberstone]] for Enid Blyton.<ref>{{cite web |title=Noddy Goes to Toyland (1963) |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b85edebf8 |website=BFI |accessdate=8 February 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, a stage production of Noddy opened at [[New Wimbledon Theatre|Wimbledon Theatre]], followed by a long UK national tour, including a Christmas season in London at the [[Lyric Hammersmith|Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith]], and was released on [[VHS|home video]] in 1994. The production was presented by Clarion Productions. The production was written and directed by [[David Wood (actor)|David Wood]] with scene and costume designs by Susie Calcutt. The original cast included [[Eric Potts]] as Big Ears and [[Karen Briffett]] as Noddy. The show was very well received among critics, audiences and even [[Enid Blyton]]'s daughter [[Gillian Baverstock]]. [[David Wood (actor)|David Wood]] adapted a successful sequel to the play entitled \"Noddy and the Tootle\" which opened at the [[Wimbledon Theatre]] and endured on a long UK National Tour in 1995\u20131996. [[Karen Briffett]] reprised her role as Noddy and Big Ears was played by [[Jonathan Broxholme]]. This production was too presented by Clarion Productions.\n\nThe characters returned between September 2002 and January 2004 for a [[computer animation|computer-animated]] series, which was eventually named ''[[Make Way for Noddy]]''. This was created by [[Chorion (company)|Chorion]], in association with SD Entertainment and the 100 episodes were produced in 2001 externally. It originally aired in 12-minute segments as part of the ''[[Milkshake!]]'' programme on Britain's [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]].\n\nIn the autumn of 2004, a set of 100 new two-minute [[TV interstitial]]s were created by Chorion. These interstitials, entitled ''Say it With Noddy'', feature Noddy learning words in a variety of foreign languages. They also introduced Noddy's new friend Whizz from Robot Village, who presses a button on his chest to play recordings of native speakers saying the new foreign words Noddy was to learn. The interstitials were featured on commercial breaks on Five and featured as segments for the American release of the show on PBS.\n\nA CG animated series, called ''Noddy in Toyland'', was made in 2009 by [[Chorion]], produced by [[Brown Bag Films]] in Ireland. The series features much more detailed faces for Big Ears and Mr. Plod, a new wardrobe for Tessie Bear, and incorporates Whizz as a full-time character. Sly and Gobbo's cousins, Sneaky and Stealth, are introduced and usually work alongside them. The full series is available digitally on [[iTunes]].\n\nIn 2012, Chorion sold the Noddy character to ClassicMedia, which in turn was bought out by DreamWorks Animation, leading to another CG animated series, named ''Noddy, Toyland Detective'' was produced by French producer/distributor [[Gaumont Animation]], in association with [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks Animation Television]], and in partnership with [[France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions]]. It premiered on [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel Five]]'s preschool block [[Milkshake!]] on 18 April 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kidscreen.com/2015/04/09/noddy-returns-to-tv-with-new-series/|title=Noddy returns to TV with new series|accessdate=13 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://kidscreen.com/2016/04/13/milkshake-sets-uk-premiere-for-noddy-reboot/|title=Milkshake sets UK premiere for Noddy reboot|accessdate=13 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Other media==\nThere was a spoof page of \"Noddy-ana\" in ''[[Hot Rod (magazine)|Hot Rod]]'' magazine (U.K.), in about 1976\u20131978; Noddy had a [[hot rod]], and Big Ears smoked, and was very disrespectful to Mr. Plod.\n\nIn the book ''[[Seven Deadly Wonders]]'' by [[Matthew Reilly]], a character is nicknamed Noddy, while his best friend's nickname is Big Ears.\n\n[[IDW Publishing|IDW]]'s [[The Transformers (IDW Publishing)|''The Transformers'']] introduced the character of \"Tappet\", a robot who is based on Noddy visually and clearly transforms into Noddy's classic car.\n\nThe puppet of Big Ears from the 1955\u20131963 Noddy television series appeared as a member of the \"Puppet Government\" in ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]'' episode \"[[The Goodies Rule \u2013 O.K.?]]\".\n\nIn Alan Moore's series ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'', Toyland is a real nation located in the [[Arctic Circle]]. The King and Queen of Toyland are [[Frankenstein's Monster]] and Olympia, the automaton from ''[[The Tales of Hoffmann]]''.\n\nNoddy, Big Ears and PC Plod are referred to in the ''[[Two Ronnies]]'' crossword sketch where [[Ronnie Corbett]] thinks their names are \"Roddy, Big Ears, and PC Plop!\"\n\nIn an episode of ''[[Last of the Summer Wine]]'', all of the characters dressed up as fairy tale characters for a parade. Smiler is dressed as Noddy complete with a smaller version of his car in order to tow a [[bouncy castle]] with the rest of the characters on it. But it deflated while they were taking part.\n\n==Derivative uses==\nNoddy being associated with small children's reading has led to \"Noddy\" being sometimes used as an adjective meaning \"petty or trivial\" (compare with \"[[Mickey Mouse]]\"), for example, in [[computer programming]]: \"''This [[simultaneous linear equation]] [[subroutine]] crashes out on the Noddy case when n = 1, but otherwise it works.''\" or \"''Remember to check all the Noddy cases.''\"\n\n== See also ==\n''[[Toytown]]'' was a BBC radio series for children, broadcast for Children's Hour on the Home Service from 1929.

Upon hearing her first cry, the fortune teller predicted on the spot that the baby \"boy\" would grow up to be a great success and a natural-born leader. But when the nurses announced that the baby was a girl, the stunned fortune teller immediately announced that the girl would not survive childhood unless she lived as a boy for the first 25 years of her life; only then could Ya Nuo change her bad fate and bring prosperity to her family.\n\nHaving lived her life as a boy, Ya Nuo was shy and always tried to keep her distance from people to hide her true identity. This mysterious aloofness made her irresistible to the girls around her.

Upon hearing her first cry, the fortune teller predicted on the spot that the baby \"boy\" would grow up to be a great success and a natural-born leader. But when the nurses announced that the baby was a girl, the stunned fortune teller immediately announced that the girl would not survive her childhood unless she lived as a boy for the first 25 years of her life; only then could Ya Nuo change her bad fate and bring prosperity to her family.\n\nHaving lived her life as a boy, Ya Nuo was shy and always tried to keep her distance from people to hide her true identity. This mysterious aloofness made her irresistible to the girls around her. One day, she accidentally helped out Du Zi Feng (Baron Chen), who happened to be a triad leader, and his sister, Du Zi Han (Mandy Tao). While Zi Han fell in love with Ya Nuo, Zi Feng became Ya Nuo's \"sworn brother\" and best friend.
