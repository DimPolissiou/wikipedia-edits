There was an unsuccessful attempt to revive regular production in 1996 with a [[backdoor pilot]], in the form of a television film titled ''[[Doctor Who (film)|Doctor Who]]''. The programme was [[History of Doctor Who#2000s|relaunched in 2005]], and since then has been produced in-house by [[BBC Cymru Wales|BBC Wales]] in [[Cardiff]]. ''Doctor Who'' has also spawned numerous [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-offs]], including comic books, films, novels, audio dramas, and the television series ''[[Torchwood]]'' (2006\u20132011), ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'' (2007\u20132011), ''[[K-9 (TV series)|K-9]]'' (2009\u20132010), and ''[[Class (2016 TV series)|Class]]'' (2016), and has been the subject of many parodies and references in popular culture.\n\nThirteen actors have headlined the series as the Doctor. The transition from one actor to another is written into the plot of the show with the [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|concept of regeneration]] into a new [[incarnation]], a [[plot device]] in which a Time Lord \"transforms\" into a new body when the current one is too badly harmed to heal normally. Each actor's portrayal is unique, but all represent stages in the life of the same character, and together, they form a single lifetime with a single narrative. The time-travelling feature of the plot means that different incarnations of the Doctor occasionally meet. The Doctor is currently portrayed by [[Jodie Whittaker]], who took on the role after [[Peter Capaldi]]'s exit in the 2017 Christmas special \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\".\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Premise==\n''Doctor Who'' follows the adventures of the title character, a rogue [[Time Lord]] from the planet [[Gallifrey]] who goes by the name \"[[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]]\". The Doctor fled Gallifrey in a stolen [[TARDIS]] (\"Time and Relative Dimension in Space\"), a [[time travel|time machine]] that travels by materialising into and dematerialising out of the time vortex. The TARDIS has a vast interior but appears smaller on the outside, and is equipped with a \"chameleon circuit\" intended to make the machine take on the appearance of local objects as a disguise; due to a malfunction, the Doctor's TARDIS remains fixed as a blue British [[police box]].\n\nAcross time and space, the Doctor's many incarnations often find events that pique their curiosity and try to prevent evil forces from harming innocent people or changing history, using only ingenuity and minimal resources, such as the versatile [[sonic screwdriver]]. The Doctor rarely travels alone and often brings one or more [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companions]] to share these adventures. These companions are usually humans, owing to the Doctor's fascination with planet Earth, which also leads to frequent collaborations with the international military task force [[UNIT]] when the Earth is threatened. The Doctor is centuries old and, as a Time Lord, has the ability to [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerate]] in case of mortal damage to the body, taking on a new appearance and personality. The Doctor has gained numerous reoccurring enemies during their travels, including the [[Dalek]]s, the [[Cybermen]], and [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]], another renegade Time Lord.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Doctor Who}}\n''Doctor Who'' first appeared on [[BBC One|BBC TV]] at 17:16:20 [[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]] on Saturday, 23 November 1963; this was eighty seconds later than the scheduled programme time, due to the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] the previous day.<ref>Howe, Stammers, Walker (1994), p. 54</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/unearthlychild/detail.shtml|title=An Unearthly Child|publisher=BBC|date=16 August 2012|access-date=20 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190626184328/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/unearthlychild/detail.shtml|archive-date=26 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> It was to be a regular weekly programme, each episode 25 minutes of transmission length. Discussions and plans for the programme had been in progress for a year. The [[BBC television drama|head of drama]] [[Sydney Newman]] was mainly responsible for developing the programme, with the first format document for the series being written by Newman along with the head of the script department (later head of serials) [[Donald Wilson (writer and producer)|Donald Wilson]] and staff writer [[C. E. Webber]]. Writer [[Anthony Coburn]], [[Script editor|story editor]] [[David Whitaker (screenwriter)|David Whitaker]] and initial producer [[Verity Lambert]] also heavily contributed to the development of the series.<ref>Howe, Stammers, Walker (1994), pp. 157\u2013230 (\"Production Diary\")</ref><ref group=note>Newman is often given sole creator credit for the series. Some reference works such as ''The Complete Encyclopedia of Television Programs 1947\u20131979'' by Vincent Terrace erroneously credit Terry Nation with creating ''Doctor Who'', because of the way his name is credited in the two Peter Cushing films.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}<br />Newman and Lambert's role in originating the series was recognised in the 2007 episode \"[[Human Nature (Doctor Who episode)|Human Nature]]\", in which the Doctor, in disguise as a human named John Smith, gives his parents' names as Sydney and Verity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe programme was originally intended to appeal to a family audience<ref>Howe, Stammers, Walker (1992), p. 3.</ref> as an educational programme using time travel as a means to explore scientific ideas and famous moments in history. On 31 July 1963, Whitaker commissioned [[Terry Nation]] to write a story under the title ''The Mutants''. As originally written, the [[Dalek]]s and [[Thal (Doctor Who)|Thals]] were the victims of an alien [[neutron bomb]] attack but Nation later dropped the aliens and made the Daleks the aggressors. When the script was presented to Newman and Wilson it was immediately rejected as the programme was not permitted to contain any \"[[bug-eyed monster]]s\". According to producer Verity Lambert; \"We didn't have a lot of choice&nbsp;\u2014 we only had the Dalek serial to go&nbsp;... We had a bit of a crisis of confidence because Donald [Wilson] was so adamant that we shouldn't make it. Had we had anything else ready we would have made that.\" Nation's script became the second ''Doctor Who'' serial&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[The Daleks]]'' (also known as ''The Mutants''). The serial introduced the eponymous aliens that would become the series' most popular monsters, and was responsible for the BBC's first merchandising boom.<ref>Steve Tribe, James Goss ''Dr Who: The Dalek Handbook'' [[BBC Books]] [[Random House]] 2011 {{ISBN|978-1-84990-232-8}} Pg9</ref>\n\nThe BBC drama department's serials division produced the programme for 26 seasons, broadcast on [[BBC One|BBC 1]].

[[Philip Segal]], a British [[expatriate]] who worked for [[Columbia Pictures]]' television arm in the United States, had approached the BBC about such a venture as early as July 1989, while the 26th season was still in production.<ref name=\"8thdrspecial\">Doctor Who Magazine Eighth Doctor Special, Panini Comics 2003</ref> Segal's negotiations eventually led to a [[Doctor Who (film)|''Doctor Who'' television film]], broadcast on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network]] in 1996 as an [[international co-production]] between Fox, [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]], the BBC and [[BBC Worldwide]]. Although the film was successful in the UK (with 9.1&nbsp;million viewers), it was less so in the United States and did not lead to a series.<ref name=\"8thdrspecial\" />\n\nLicensed media such as novels and audio plays provided [[Doctor Who spin-offs|new stories]], but as a television programme ''Doctor Who'' remained dormant until 2003.

The 1993 2-part story, entitled ''[[Dimensions in Time]]'', was made in collaboration with the cast of the BBC soap-opera ''[[EastEnders]]'' and was filmed partly on the ''EastEnders'' set.

In ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', [[Richard Hurndall]] played the First Doctor due to William Hartnell's death in 1975; 34 years later [[David Bradley (English actor)|David Bradley]] similarly replaced Hartnell in ''[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]''. In ''[[Time and the Rani]]'', Sylvester McCoy briefly played the Sixth Doctor during the regeneration sequence, carrying on as the Seventh. For more information, see the [[list of actors who have played the Doctor]]. In other media, the Doctor has been played by various other actors, including [[Peter Cushing]] in [[Dr. Who (Dalek films)|two films]].\n\nThe casting of a new Doctor has often inspired debate and speculation. Common topics of focus include the Doctor's gender (prior to the casting of Whittaker, all official incarnations were male), race (all Doctors were white prior to the casting of [[Jo Martin]] in \"[[Fugitive of the Judoon]]\") and age (the youngest actor to be cast is Smith at 26, and the oldest are Capaldi and Hartnell, both 55).<ref>Ted B.

In 1973's ''[[The Three Doctors (Doctor Who)|The Three Doctors]]'', William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton returned alongside Jon Pertwee. For 1983's ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', Troughton and Pertwee returned to star with Peter Davison, and Tom Baker appeared in previously unseen footage from the uncompleted ''[[Shada (Doctor Who)|Shada]]'' serial. For this episode, Richard Hurndall replaced William Hartnell. Patrick Troughton again returned in 1985's ''[[The Two Doctors]]'' with Colin Baker. In 2007, Peter Davison returned in the Children in Need short \"[[Time Crash]]\" alongside David Tennant. In \"[[The Name of the Doctor]]\" (2013), the Eleventh Doctor meets a previously unseen incarnation of himself, subsequently revealed to be the [[War Doctor]].<ref name=\"HurtDoctor\" /> In the following episode, \"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\", David Tennant's [[Tenth Doctor]] appeared alongside [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]] as the [[Eleventh Doctor]] and [[John Hurt]] as the [[War Doctor]], as well as brief footage from all of the previous actors.<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Day of the Doctor|series=Doctor Who|network=BBC|station=BBC One|location=Cardiff|date=23 November 2013|minutes=60}}</ref> Additionally, multiple incarnations of the Doctor have met in various [[Doctor Who#Audios|audio dramas]] and [[Doctor Who#Books|novels]] based on the television show. In 2017, the First Doctor (this time portrayed by [[David Bradley (English actor)|David Bradley]]) returned alongside Peter Capaldi in \"[[The Doctor Falls]]\" and \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\". In 2020\u2019s \u201cFugitive of the Judoon\u201d, Jodie Whittaker as the Thirteenth Doctor meets Jo Martin\u2019s incarnation of the Doctor, subsequently known as the Fugitive Doctor. They met later, albeit briefly, in \u201cThe Timeless Children\u201d later that year.\n\n====Revelations about the Doctor====\n{{See also|The Doctor (Doctor Who)#Inconsistencies|l1=The Doctor: Inconsistencies}}\n\nThroughout the programme's long history, there have been revelations about the Doctor that have raised additional questions. In ''[[The Brain of Morbius]]'' (1976), it was hinted that the First Doctor might not have been the first incarnation (although the other faces depicted might have been incarnations of the Time Lord Morbius). In subsequent stories the First Doctor was depicted as the earliest incarnation of the Doctor. In ''[[Mawdryn Undead]]'' (1983), the Fifth Doctor explicitly confirmed that he was then currently in his fifth incarnation. Later that same year, during 1983's 20th Anniversary special ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', the First Doctor enquires as to the Fifth Doctor's regeneration; when the Fifth Doctor confirms \"Fourth\", the First Doctor excitedly replies \"Goodness me. So there are five of me now.\" In 2010, the Eleventh Doctor similarly calls himself \"the Eleventh\" in \"[[The Lodger (Doctor Who)|The Lodger]]\". In the 2013 episode \"The Time of the Doctor,\" the Eleventh Doctor clarified he was the product of the twelfth regeneration, due to a previous incarnation which he chose not to count and one other aborted regeneration. The name Eleventh is still used for this incarnation; the same episode depicts the prophesied \"Fall of the Eleventh\" which had been trailed throughout the series.\n\nDuring the Seventh Doctor's era, it was hinted that the Doctor was more than just an ordinary Time Lord. In the [[Doctor Who (1996 film)|1996 television film]], the Eighth Doctor describes himself as being \"half human\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/tvmovie/detail.shtml|title=Doctor Who: the TV movie|publisher=BBC|accessdate=13 June 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227174852/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/tvmovie/detail.shtml|archive-date=27 February 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> The BBC's FAQ for the programme notes that \"purists tend to disregard this\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s4/faq/plot_continuity.shtml|title=Doctor Who&nbsp;\u2014 FAQ&nbsp;\u2014 Plot and Continuity|publisher=BBC|date=28 March 2008|accessdate=30 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126134638/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s4/faq/plot_continuity.shtml|archive-date=26 January 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> instead focusing on his Gallifreyan heritage.\n\nThe programme's first serial, ''[[An Unearthly Child]]'', shows that the Doctor has a granddaughter, [[Susan Foreman]]. In the 1967 serial, ''[[Tomb of the Cybermen]]'', when [[Victoria Waterfield]] doubts the Doctor can remember his family because of, \"being so ancient\", the Doctor says that he can when he really wants to\u2014\"The rest of the time they sleep in my mind\". The 2005 series reveals that the Ninth Doctor thought he was the last surviving Time Lord, and that his home planet had been destroyed; in \"[[The Empty Child]]\" (2005), Dr. Constantine states that, \"Before the war even began, I was a father and a grandfather. Now I am neither.\" The Doctor remarks in response, \"Yeah, I know the feeling.\" In \"[[Smith and Jones (Doctor Who)|Smith and Jones]]\" (2007), when asked if he had a brother, he replied, \"No, not any more.\" In both \"[[Fear Her]]\" (2006) and \"[[The Doctor's Daughter]]\" (2008), he states that he had, in the past, been a father.\n\nIn \"[[The Wedding of River Song]]\" (2011), it is implied that the Doctor's true name is a secret that must never be revealed; this is explored further in \"[[The Name of the Doctor]]\" (2013), when River Song speaking his name allows the [[Great Intelligence]] to enter his tomb, and in \"The Time of the Doctor\" (2013) where speaking his true name becomes the signal by which the Time Lords would know they can safely return to the universe.\n\n===Companions===\n{{Main|Companion (Doctor Who)}}\nThe companion figure&nbsp;\u2013 generally a human&nbsp;\u2013 has been a constant feature in ''Doctor Who'' since the programme's inception in 1963.

These characters were intended to act as [[audience surrogates]], through which the audience would discover information about the Doctor who was to act as a mysterious father figure.<ref name=Overview/> The only story from the original series in which the Doctor travels alone is ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'' (1976). Notable companions from the earlier series included [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] ([[Mary Tamm]] and [[Lalla Ward]]), a [[Time Lord|Time Lady]]; [[Sarah Jane Smith]] ([[Elisabeth Sladen]]); and [[Jo Grant]] ([[Katy Manning]]). Dramatically, these characters provide a figure with whom the audience can identify, and serve to further the story by requesting exposition from the Doctor and manufacturing peril for the Doctor to resolve. The Doctor regularly gains new companions and loses old ones; sometimes they return home or find new causes&nbsp;\u2014 or loves&nbsp;\u2014 on worlds they have visited. Some have died during the course of the series. Companions are usually human, or humanoid aliens.\n\nSince the 2005 revival, the Doctor generally travels with a primary female companion, who occupies a larger narrative role. Steven Moffat described the companion as the main character of the show, as the story begins anew with each companion and she undergoes more change than the Doctor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-04-19/steven-moffat-the-companion-is-the-main-character-in-doctor-who-not-the-doctor|title=Steven Moffat: the companion is the main character in Doctor Who, not the Doctor|work=Radio Times|publisher=[[BBC Magazines]]|last=Jones|first=Paul|date=19 April 2012|accessdate=28 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203120410/http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-04-19/steven-moffat-the-companion-is-the-main-character-in-doctor-who-not-the-doctor|archive-date=3 December 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2013/03/doctor-who-returns-steven-moffat-talks-new-companion-clara-and-jenna-louise-coleman.html|title='Doctor Who' returns: Steven Moffat talks new companion Clara and Jenna-Louise Coleman|publisher=[[Zap2it]]|last=Berkshire|first=Geoff|date=27 March 2013|accessdate=28 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002317/http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2013/03/doctor-who-returns-steven-moffat-talks-new-companion-clara-and-jenna-louise-coleman.html|archivedate=3 December 2013}}</ref> The primary companions of the [[Companion (Doctor Who)#Ninth Doctor|Ninth]] and [[Companion (Doctor Who)#Tenth Doctor|Tenth]] Doctors were [[Rose Tyler]] ([[Billie Piper]]), [[Martha Jones]] ([[Freema Agyeman]]), and [[Donna Noble]] ([[Catherine Tate]]) with [[Mickey Smith]] ([[Noel Clarke]]) and [[Jack Harkness]] ([[John Barrowman]]) recurring as secondary companion figures.<ref name=AbsentPostcolonial>{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Commonwealth Literature|doi=10.1177/0021989410366891|url=http://jcl.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/45/2/207|title=\"Sociopathetic Abscess\" or \"Yawning Chasm\"?

Their main weakness is their eyestalk;  attacks upon them using various weapons can blind a Dalek, making it go mad.

The original theme was composed by [[Ron Grainer]] and realised by [[Delia Derbyshire]] of the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]], with assistance from [[Dick Mills]] and was released as a single on Decca F 11837 in 1964.   The various parts were built up using [[musique concr\u00e8te]] techniques, by creating [[tape loop]]s of an individually struck piano string and individual test [[oscillation|oscillators]] and filters. The Derbyshire arrangement served, with minor edits, as the theme tune up to the end of [[Doctor Who (season 17)|season 17]] (1979\u201380). It is regarded as a significant and innovative piece of electronic music, recorded well before the availability of commercial synthesisers or multitrack mixers. Each note was individually created by cutting, splicing, speeding up and slowing down segments of [[Magnetic tape sound recording|analogue tape]] containing recordings of a single plucked string, [[white noise]], and the simple [[harmonic]] waveforms of [[Tone generator|test-tone oscillators]], intended for calibrating equipment and rooms, not creating music. New techniques were invented to allow [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] of the music, as this was before the era of multitrack tape machines. On hearing the finished result, Grainer asked, \"Jeez, Delia, did I write that?\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/articles/36b860f1-b3d5-4fcc-acdc-c2e95fb99176|title=Surprising Facts about BBC Theme Tunes You've Heard Hundreds of Times|first=Phil|last=Hebblethwaite|date=29 June 2016|website=Bbc.co.uk|access-date=12 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170725043928/https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/articles/36b860f1-b3d5-4fcc-acdc-c2e95fb99176|archive-date=25 July 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Although Grainer was willing to give Derbyshire the co-composer credit, it was against BBC policy at the time.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pidd|first1=Helen|title=Doctor Who theme's co-creator honoured with posthumous PhD|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/20/delia-derbyshire-doctor-who-theme-co-creator-posthumous-phd|website=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=31 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228115219/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/20/delia-derbyshire-doctor-who-theme-co-creator-posthumous-phd|archive-date=28 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Allen|first1=Ben|title=Doctor Who theme co-composer honoured with posthumous PhD|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2017-11-21/doctor-who-theme-co-composer-honoured-delia-derbyshire-honorary-phd/|website=Radio Times|publisher=Immediate Media Company Ltd|accessdate=31 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180101030501/http://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2017-11-21/doctor-who-theme-co-composer-honoured-delia-derbyshire-honorary-phd/|archive-date=1 January 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA different arrangement was recorded by [[Peter Howell (musician)|Peter Howell]] for [[Doctor Who (season 18)|season 18]] (1980), which was in turn replaced by [[Dominic Glynn]]'s arrangement for the season-long serial ''[[The Trial of a Time Lord]]'' in [[Doctor Who (season 23)|season 23]] (1986).

Other composers in this early period included [[Richard Rodney Bennett]], [[Carey Blyton]] and [[Geoffrey Burgon]].\n\nThe most frequent musical contributor during the first 15 years was [[Dudley Simpson]], who is also well known for his theme and incidental music for ''[[Blake's 7]]'', and for his haunting theme music and score for the original 1970s version of ''[[The Tomorrow People]]''. Simpson's first ''Doctor Who'' score was ''[[Planet of Giants]]'' (1964) and he went on to write music for many adventures of the 1960s and 1970s, including most of the stories of the Jon Pertwee/Tom Baker periods, ending with ''[[The Horns of Nimon]]'' (1979). He also made a [[cameo appearance]] in ''The Talons of Weng-Chiang'' (as a [[Music hall]] conductor).\n\nIn 1980 starting with the serial ''[[The Leisure Hive]]'' the task of creating incidental music was assigned to the Radiophonic Workshop.

An affectionate [[parody]] of the television series, it was split into four segments, mimicking the traditional serial format, complete with [[cliffhanger]]s, and running down the same corridor several times when being chased (the version released on video was split into only two episodes). In the story, the Doctor ([[Rowan Atkinson]]) encounters both [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] ([[Jonathan Pryce]]) and the [[Dalek]]s.

Ten years later, the first original Doctor Who audio was released on [[LP record]]; ''[[Doctor Who and the Pescatons]]'' featuring the Fourth Doctor.  The first commercially available audiobook was an abridged reading of the Fourth Doctor story ''[[State of Decay]]'' in 1981.

The earliest of these featured the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Doctors, with Paul McGann's Eight Doctor joining the line in 2001.  Tom Baker's Fourth Doctor began appearing for Big Finish in 2012.  Along with the main range, adventures of the First, Second and Third Doctors have been produced in both limited cast and full cast formats, as well as audiobooks.  The 2013 series ''[[Doctor Who: Destiny of the Doctor|Destiny of the Doctor]]'', produced as part of the series' 50th Anniversary celebrations, marked the first time Big Finish created stories (in this case audiobooks) featuring the Doctors from the revived show. Along with this, in May 2016 the Tenth Doctor, David Tennant, appeared alongside Catherine Tate in a collection of three audio adventures.\n\nIn addition to these main lines, both the BBC and Big Finish have produced original audio dramas and audiobooks based on spin-off material, such as ''Torchwood'' and ''The Sarah Jane Adventures'' series.\n\n===Books===\n{{See also|List of Doctor Who novelists}}\n\n''Doctor Who'' books have been published from the mid-sixties through to the present day.

Since the relaunch of the programme in 2005, a new range of novels have been published by [[BBC Books]].

There was an unsuccessful attempt to revive regular production in 1996 with a [[backdoor pilot]], in the form of a television film titled ''[[Doctor Who (film)|Doctor Who]]''. The programme was [[History of Doctor Who#2000s|relaunched in 2005]], and since then has been produced in-house by [[BBC Cymru Wales|BBC Wales]] in [[Cardiff]]. ''Doctor Who'' has also spawned numerous [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-offs]], including comic books, films, novels, audio dramas, and the television series ''[[Torchwood]]'' (2006\u20132011), ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'' (2007\u20132011), ''[[K-9 (TV series)|K-9]]'' (2009\u20132010), and ''[[Class (2016 TV series)|Class]]'' (2016), and has been the subject of many parodies and references in popular culture.\n\nThirteen actors have headlined the series as the Doctor. The transition from one actor to another is written into the plot of the show with the [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|concept of regeneration]] into a new [[incarnation]], a [[plot device]] in which a Time Lord \"transforms\" into a new body when the current one is too badly harmed to heal normally. Each actor's portrayal is unique, but all represent stages in the life of the same character, and together, they form a single lifetime with a single narrative. The time-travelling feature of the plot means that different incarnations of the Doctor occasionally meet. The Doctor is currently portrayed by [[Jodie Whittaker]], who took on the role after [[Peter Capaldi]]'s exit in the 2017 Christmas special \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\".\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Premise==\n''Doctor Who'' follows the adventures of the title character, a rogue [[Time Lord]] from the planet [[Gallifrey]] who goes by the name \"[[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]]\". The Doctor fled Gallifrey in a stolen [[TARDIS]] (\"Time and Relative Dimension in Space\"), a [[time travel|time machine]] that travels by materialising into and dematerialising out of the time vortex. The TARDIS has a vast interior but appears smaller on the outside, and is equipped with a \"chameleon circuit\" intended to make the machine take on the appearance of local objects as a disguise; due to a malfunction, the Doctor's TARDIS remains fixed as a blue British [[police box]].\n\nAcross time and space, the Doctor's many incarnations often find events that pique their curiosity and try to prevent evil forces from harming innocent people or changing history, using only ingenuity and minimal resources, such as the versatile [[sonic screwdriver]]. The Doctor rarely travels alone and often brings one or more [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companions]] to share these adventures. These companions are usually humans, owing to the Doctor's fascination with planet Earth, which also leads to frequent collaborations with the international military task force [[UNIT]] when the Earth is threatened. The Doctor is centuries old and, as a Time Lord, has the ability to [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerate]] in case of mortal damage to the body, taking on a new appearance and personality. The Doctor has gained numerous reoccurring enemies during their travels, including the [[Dalek]]s, the [[Cybermen]], and [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]], another renegade Time Lord.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Doctor Who}}\n''Doctor Who'' first appeared on [[BBC One|BBC TV]] at 17:16:20 [[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]] on Saturday, 23 November 1963; this was eighty seconds later than the scheduled programme time, due to the [[assassination of John F.

Discussions and plans for the programme had been in progress for a year. The [[BBC television drama|head of drama]] [[Sydney Newman]] was mainly responsible for developing the programme, with the first format document for the series being written by Newman along with the head of the script department (later head of serials) [[Donald Wilson (writer and producer)|Donald Wilson]] and staff writer [[C. E. Webber]]. Writer [[Anthony Coburn]], [[Script editor|story editor]] [[David Whitaker (screenwriter)|David Whitaker]] and initial producer [[Verity Lambert]] also heavily contributed to the development of the series.<ref>Howe, Stammers, Walker (1994), pp. 157\u2013230 (\"Production Diary\")</ref><ref group=note>Newman is often given sole creator credit for the series. Some reference works such as ''The Complete Encyclopedia of Television Programs 1947\u20131979'' by Vincent Terrace erroneously credit Terry Nation with creating ''Doctor Who'', because of the way his name is credited in the two Peter Cushing films.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}<br />Newman and Lambert's role in originating the series was recognised in the 2007 episode \"[[Human Nature (Doctor Who episode)|Human Nature]]\", in which the Doctor, in disguise as a human named John Smith, gives his parents' names as Sydney and Verity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe programme was originally intended to appeal to a family audience<ref>Howe, Stammers, Walker (1992), p. 3.</ref> as an educational programme using time travel as a means to explore scientific ideas and famous moments in history. On 31 July 1963, Whitaker commissioned [[Terry Nation]] to write a story under the title ''The Mutants''. As originally written, the [[Dalek]]s and [[Thal (Doctor Who)|Thals]] were the victims of an alien [[neutron bomb]] attack but Nation later dropped the aliens and made the Daleks the aggressors. When the script was presented to Newman and Wilson it was immediately rejected as the programme was not permitted to contain any \"[[bug-eyed monster]]s\". According to producer Verity Lambert; \"We didn't have a lot of choice&nbsp;\u2014 we only had the Dalek serial to go&nbsp;... We had a bit of a crisis of confidence because Donald [Wilson] was so adamant that we shouldn't make it. Had we had anything else ready we would have made that.\" Nation's script became the second ''Doctor Who'' serial&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[The Daleks]]'' (also known as ''The Mutants''). The serial introduced the eponymous aliens that would become the series' most popular monsters, and was responsible for the BBC's first merchandising boom.<ref>Steve Tribe, James Goss ''Dr Who: The Dalek Handbook'' [[BBC Books]] [[Random House]] 2011 {{ISBN|978-1-84990-232-8}} Pg9</ref>\n\nThe BBC drama department's serials division produced the programme for 26 seasons, broadcast on [[BBC One|BBC 1]].

In ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', [[Richard Hurndall]] played the First Doctor due to William Hartnell's death in 1975; 34 years later [[David Bradley (English actor)|David Bradley]] similarly replaced Hartnell in ''[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]''. In ''[[Time and the Rani]]'', Sylvester McCoy briefly played the Sixth Doctor during the regeneration sequence, carrying on as the Seventh. For more information, see the [[list of actors who have played the Doctor]]. In other media, the Doctor has been played by various other actors, including [[Peter Cushing]] in [[Dr. Who (Dalek films)|two films]].\n\nThe casting of a new Doctor has often inspired debate and speculation. Common topics of focus include the Doctor's gender (prior to the casting of Whittaker, all official incarnations were male), race (all Doctors were white prior to the casting of [[Jo Martin]] in \"[[Fugitive of the Judoon]]\") and age (the youngest actor to be cast is Smith at 26, and the oldest are Capaldi and Hartnell, both 55).<ref>Ted B.

In 1973's ''[[The Three Doctors (Doctor Who)|The Three Doctors]]'', William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton returned alongside Jon Pertwee. For 1983's ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', Troughton and Pertwee returned to star with Peter Davison, and Tom Baker appeared in previously unseen footage from the uncompleted ''[[Shada (Doctor Who)|Shada]]'' serial. For this episode, Richard Hurndall replaced William Hartnell. Patrick Troughton again returned in 1985's ''[[The Two Doctors]]'' with Colin Baker. In 2007, Peter Davison returned in the Children in Need short \"[[Time Crash]]\" alongside David Tennant. In \"[[The Name of the Doctor]]\" (2013), the Eleventh Doctor meets a previously unseen incarnation of himself, subsequently revealed to be the [[War Doctor]].<ref name=\"HurtDoctor\" /> In the following episode, \"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\", David Tennant's [[Tenth Doctor]] appeared alongside [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]] as the [[Eleventh Doctor]] and [[John Hurt]] as the [[War Doctor]], as well as brief footage from all of the previous actors.<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Day of the Doctor|series=Doctor Who|network=BBC|station=BBC One|location=Cardiff|date=23 November 2013|minutes=60}}</ref> Additionally, multiple incarnations of the Doctor have met in various [[Doctor Who#Audios|audio dramas]] and [[Doctor Who#Books|novels]] based on the television show. In 2017, the First Doctor (this time portrayed by [[David Bradley (English actor)|David Bradley]]) returned alongside Peter Capaldi in \"[[The Doctor Falls]]\" and \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\". In 2020\u2019s \u201cFugitive of the Judoon\u201d, Jodie Whittaker as the Thirteenth Doctor meets Jo Martin\u2019s incarnation of the Doctor, subsequently known as the Fugitive Doctor. They met later, albeit briefly, in \u201cThe Timeless Children\u201d later that year.\n\n====Revelations about the Doctor====\n{{See also|The Doctor (Doctor Who)#Inconsistencies|l1=The Doctor: Inconsistencies}}\n\nThroughout the programme's long history, there have been revelations about the Doctor that have raised additional questions. In ''[[The Brain of Morbius]]'' (1976), it was hinted that the First Doctor might not have been the first incarnation (although the other faces depicted might have been incarnations of the Time Lord Morbius). In subsequent stories the First Doctor was depicted as the earliest incarnation of the Doctor. In ''[[Mawdryn Undead]]'' (1983), the Fifth Doctor explicitly confirmed that he was then currently in his fifth incarnation. Later that same year, during 1983's 20th Anniversary special ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', the First Doctor enquires as to the Fifth Doctor's regeneration; when the Fifth Doctor confirms \"Fourth\", the First Doctor excitedly replies \"Goodness me. So there are five of me now.\" In 2010, the Eleventh Doctor similarly calls himself \"the Eleventh\" in \"[[The Lodger (Doctor Who)|The Lodger]]\". In the 2013 episode \"The Time of the Doctor,\" the Eleventh Doctor clarified he was the product of the twelfth regeneration, due to a previous incarnation which he chose not to count and one other aborted regeneration. The name Eleventh is still used for this incarnation; the same episode depicts the prophesied \"Fall of the Eleventh\" which had been trailed throughout the series.\n\nDuring the Seventh Doctor's era, it was hinted that the Doctor was more than just an ordinary Time Lord.

These characters were intended to act as [[audience surrogates]], through which the audience would discover information about the Doctor who was to act as a mysterious father figure.<ref name=Overview/> The only story from the original series in which the Doctor travels alone is ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'' (1976). Notable companions from the earlier series included [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] ([[Mary Tamm]] and [[Lalla Ward]]), a [[Time Lord|Time Lady]]; [[Sarah Jane Smith]] ([[Elisabeth Sladen]]); and [[Jo Grant]] ([[Katy Manning]]). Dramatically, these characters provide a figure with whom the audience can identify, and serve to further the story by requesting exposition from the Doctor and manufacturing peril for the Doctor to resolve. The Doctor regularly gains new companions and loses old ones; sometimes they return home or find new causes&nbsp;\u2014 or loves&nbsp;\u2014 on worlds they have visited. Some have died during the course of the series. Companions are usually human, or humanoid aliens.\n\nSince the 2005 revival, the Doctor generally travels with a primary female companion, who occupies a larger narrative role.

Their main weakness is their eyestalk;  attacks upon them using various weapons can blind a Dalek, making it go mad. Their chief role in the series plot, as they frequently remark in their instantly recognisable metallic voices, is to \"exterminate\" all non-Dalek beings. They even attack the [[Time Lord]]s in the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]], as shown during the 50th Anniversary of the show.

The original theme was composed by [[Ron Grainer]] and realised by [[Delia Derbyshire]] of the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]], with assistance from [[Dick Mills]] and was released as a single on Decca F 11837 in 1964.   The various parts were built up using [[musique concr\u00e8te]] techniques, by creating [[tape loop]]s of an individually struck piano string and individual test [[oscillation|oscillators]] and filters. The Derbyshire arrangement served, with minor edits, as the theme tune up to the end of [[Doctor Who (season 17)|season 17]] (1979\u201380). It is regarded as a significant and innovative piece of electronic music, recorded well before the availability of commercial synthesisers or multitrack mixers. Each note was individually created by cutting, splicing, speeding up and slowing down segments of [[Magnetic tape sound recording|analogue tape]] containing recordings of a single plucked string, [[white noise]], and the simple [[harmonic]] waveforms of [[Tone generator|test-tone oscillators]], intended for calibrating equipment and rooms, not creating music. New techniques were invented to allow [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] of the music, as this was before the era of multitrack tape machines.

Since its 2005 return, the series has featured occasional use of excerpts of pop music from the 1970s to the 2000s.\n\nThe incidental music for the first ''Doctor Who'' adventure, ''An Unearthly Child'', was written by [[Norman Kay (composer)|Norman Kay]]. Many of the stories of the [[William Hartnell]] period were scored by electronic music pioneer [[Tristram Cary]], whose ''Doctor Who'' credits include ''The Daleks'', ''[[Marco Polo (Doctor Who)|Marco Polo]]'', ''The Daleks' Master Plan'', ''The Gunfighters'' and ''[[The Mutants]]''. Other composers in this early period included [[Richard Rodney Bennett]], [[Carey Blyton]] and [[Geoffrey Burgon]].\n\nThe most frequent musical contributor during the first 15 years was [[Dudley Simpson]], who is also well known for his theme and incidental music for ''[[Blake's 7]]'', and for his haunting theme music and score for the original 1970s version of ''[[The Tomorrow People]]''. Simpson's first ''Doctor Who'' score was ''[[Planet of Giants]]'' (1964) and he went on to write music for many adventures of the 1960s and 1970s, including most of the stories of the Jon Pertwee/Tom Baker periods, ending with ''[[The Horns of Nimon]]'' (1979). He also made a [[cameo appearance]] in ''The Talons of Weng-Chiang'' (as a [[Music hall]] conductor).\n\nIn 1980 starting with the serial ''[[The Leisure Hive]]'' the task of creating incidental music was assigned to the Radiophonic Workshop. [[Paddy Kingsland]] and [[Peter Howell (musician)|Peter Howell]] contributed many scores in this period and other contributors included [[Roger Limb]], [[Malcolm Clarke (composer)|Malcolm Clarke]] and [[Jonathan Gibbs (composer)|Jonathan Gibbs]].\n\nThe Radiophonic Workshop was dropped after 1986's ''[[The Trial of a Time Lord]]'' series, and [[Keff McCulloch]] took over as the series' main composer until the end of its run, with [[Dominic Glynn]] and [[Mark Ayres]] also contributing scores.\n\nFrom the 2005 revival to the 2017 Christmas episode \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/921558/Doctor-Who-BBC-Series-11-Jodie-Whittaker-Bradley-Walsh-Exit-Composer-Writer-Murray-Gold-Dr|title=Doctor Who: Bradley Walsh WON'T work with two big stars after they confirm their exits|first=Rory|last=O'Connor|publisher=Express|date=20 February 2018|accessdate=20 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612232906/https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/921558/Doctor-Who-BBC-Series-11-Jodie-Whittaker-Bradley-Walsh-Exit-Composer-Writer-Murray-Gold-Dr|archive-date=12 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> all incidental music for the series was composed by [[Murray Gold]] and [[Ben Foster (orchestrator)|Ben Foster]], and has been performed by the [[BBC National Orchestra of Wales]] from the 2005 Christmas episode \"[[The Christmas Invasion]]\" onwards.

It also featured a crossover with the soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]'', the action taking place in the latter's [[Albert Square]] location and around [[Greenwich]]. The special was one of several special 3D programmes the BBC produced at the time, using a 3D system that made use of the [[Pulfrich effect]] requiring glasses with one darkened lens; the picture would look normal to those viewers who watched without the glasses.\n\nIn 1999, another special, ''[[Doctor Who: The Curse of Fatal Death|Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death]]'', was made for [[Comic Relief]] and later released on VHS. An affectionate [[parody]] of the television series, it was split into four segments, mimicking the traditional serial format, complete with [[cliffhanger]]s, and running down the same corridor several times when being chased (the version released on video was split into only two episodes). In the story, the Doctor ([[Rowan Atkinson]]) encounters both [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] ([[Jonathan Pryce]]) and the [[Dalek]]s. During the special the Doctor is forced to regenerate several times, with his subsequent incarnations played by, in order, [[Richard E. Grant]], [[Jim Broadbent]], [[Hugh Grant]] and [[Joanna Lumley]]. The script was written by [[Steven Moffat]], later to be head writer and executive producer to the revived series.<ref name=RTDgone>{{cite news|title=Doctor Who guru Davies steps down|work=BBC News|date=20 May 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7411177.stm|accessdate=20 May 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215163911/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7411177.stm|archive-date=15 February 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSince the return of ''Doctor Who'' in 2005, the franchise has produced two original \"mini-episodes\" to support Children in Need.

Ten years later, the first original Doctor Who audio was released on [[LP record]]; ''[[Doctor Who and the Pescatons]]'' featuring the Fourth Doctor.

Along with the main range, adventures of the First, Second and Third Doctors have been produced in both limited cast and full cast formats, as well as audiobooks.  The 2013 series ''[[Doctor Who: Destiny of the Doctor|Destiny of the Doctor]]'', produced as part of the series' 50th Anniversary celebrations, marked the first time Big Finish created stories (in this case audiobooks) featuring the Doctors from the revived show. Along with this, in May 2016 the Tenth Doctor, David Tennant, appeared alongside Catherine Tate in a collection of three audio adventures.\n\nIn addition to these main lines, both the BBC and Big Finish have produced original audio dramas and audiobooks based on spin-off material, such as ''Torchwood'' and ''The Sarah Jane Adventures'' series.\n\n===Books===\n{{See also|List of Doctor Who novelists}}\n\n''Doctor Who'' books have been published from the mid-sixties through to the present day.

Since the relaunch of the programme in 2005, a new range of novels have been published by [[BBC Books]].

Nine of her titles at the U.S. Championships came from 1909 to 1911, when she swept the singles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles competitions three consecutive years.<ref>{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Bud|title=The Bud Collins History of Tennis|year=2010|publisher=New Chapter Press|location=[New York]|isbn=978-0942257700|edition=2nd|pages=467, 468, 479, 481}}</ref>\n\nWightman is known as the \"Queen Mother of American Tennis\" or \"Lady Tennis\" for her lifelong participation in and promotion of women's tennis and because she was instrumental in organizing the Ladies International Tennis Challenge between British and American women's teams, better known as the [[Wightman Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Hall of Famers \u2013 Hazel Hotchkiss Wightman|url=http://www.tennisfame.com/hall-of-famers/inductees/hazel-hotchkiss-wightman|publisher=International Tennis Hall of Fame|accessdate=22 September 2012}}</ref> The cup first was held in 1923 and continued through 1989. She played five years on the American team and was the captain of the American team from inception of the competition through 1948. The cup was composed of five singles and two doubles matches. The cup itself was donated in 1923 by Wightman in honor of her husband. The first contest at Forest Hills, New York on August 11 and 13, 1923 was won by the United States.\n\nBorn during the early days of American tennis, Wightman was a frail and awkward child. Her doctor recommended that she take up a sport to strengthen herself. Her brother suggested tennis as it was considered a \"genteel\" sport. Wightman learned to play at the nearby courts of the University of California, Berkeley where she graduated in 1911. Her rivalry with fellow Californian, [[May Sutton]], shaped a new women's game, with Wightman attacking the net to counter Sutton's dominating forehand.<ref name=ohnsorg>{{cite book|last=Ohnsorg|first=Roger W.|title=Robert Lindley Murray: The Reluctant U.S. Tennis Champion; includes \"The First Forty Years of American Tennis\"|publisher=Trafford On Demand Pub|location=Victoria, BC|isbn=978-1-4269-4514-4|page=47}}</ref>\n\nWightman devoted herself to teaching young people, opening her home near Boston's [[Longwood Cricket Club]] to aspiring champions. In recognition of Wightman's contributions to tennis, the [[United States Tennis Association#Awards|USTA Service Bowl]] was donated in her honor. In 1973, Wightman was appointed as an honorary Commander of the [[Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire|Order of the British Empire]].<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1913&dat=19730825&id=uqMgAAAAIBAJ&sjid=p2gFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1056,3618634&hl=en \"You would like to be served this time\"], Lewiston Evening journal, 25 August 1973</ref><ref>[https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/wi/hazel-wightman-1.html Olympic profile of Hazel Wightman], Sports-Reference.com</ref>\n\n*17 [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] titles (4 singles, 7 women's doubles, 6 mixed doubles)\n*Won all three titles at the U.S. Championships: 1909\u20131911\n*Won singles title at the U.S. Championships: 1909\u20131911, 1919\n*Runner-up in singles at the U.S. Championships: 1915\n*Won women's doubles title at the U.S. Championships: 1909\u20131911, 1915, 1924, 1928\n*Runner-up in women's doubles at the U.S. Championships: 1919, 1923\n*Won mixed doubles title at the U.S. Championships: 1909\u20131911, 1915, 1918, 1920\n*Runner-up in mixed doubles at the U.S. Championships: 1926\n*Won women's doubles title at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]]: 1924\n*Olympic gold medalist in women's doubles and mixed doubles: 1924\n*Won singles title at the [[US Indoors|U.S. Indoor Championships]]: 1919, 1927\n*Won women's doubles title at the U.S. Indoor Championships: 1919, 1921, 1924, 1927\u20131931, 1933, 1943\n*Runner-up in women's doubles at the U.S. Indoor Championships: 1923, 1926, 1932, 1941, 1946\n*Won mixed doubles title at the U.S. Indoor Championships: 1923, 1924, 1926\u20131928\n*Won doubles title at the U.S. Grass Court Championships (for age 40 and over): 1940\u20131942, 1944, 1946\u20131950, 1952, 1954\n*U.S. Wightman Cup team member: 1923, 1924, 1927, 1929, 1931\n*U.S. Wightman Cup team captain: 1923, 1924, 1927, 1929, 1931, 1933, 1935, 1937\u20131939, 1946\u20131948\n*Winner of USTA Service Bowl, donated in Wightman's honor: 1940, 1946\n*Author of ''Better Tennis''\n*Coached several women champions, including [[Sarah Palfrey Cooke]], [[Helen Wills Moody]], and [[Helen Jacobs]]\n*Inducted into the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] in 1957\n*Appointed as an Honorary [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1973\n*Inducted into the [[International Women's Sports Hall of Fame]] in 1986\n*First honoree in the University of California women's athlete hall of fame\n\n==Career in depth==\n[[File:Hazel Hotchkiss cropped.jpg|thumb]]\nThough short in stature, Wightman anticipated and moved extremely well around a tennis court. She perfected her volleying style early, hitting the ball against the family home in Berkeley, California, where she grew up and graduated from the University of California. She refused to let the ball bounce because the yard was so uneven. She used to play against her four brothers and then the proud and spiky Sutton sisters.\n\nWightman was a shy, somewhat awed, and fascinated 22-year-old college girl when she arrived at the Philadelphia Cricket Club in 1909 for the [[U.S. Open (tennis)|U.S. Championships]]. She never before played on grass, but she used her attacking style and rock-ribbed volleying\u2014she was the first woman to rely so heavily on the volley\u2014to win the all-comers final over [[Louise Hammond Raymond|Louise Hammond]] 6\u20138, 6\u20131, 6\u20134 and then the title over 39-year-old [[Maud Barger-Wallach]] 6\u20130, 6\u20131. Wightman also won the women's doubles and mixed doubles titles that year.\n\nIn the 1910 Washington State Championships, Wightman won one of the few recorded \"Golden Matches\" in which the winner did not lose a point. She defeated a Miss Huiskamp (first name unknown).<ref>''All-Time Records'', [[Tennis (magazine)|Tennis Magazine]], February 1981, page 72</ref>\n\nWightman successfully defended all three titles at the U.S. Championships in 1910 and 1911. Wightman easily defeated Hammond in the 1910 singles final. [[May Sutton]], an old West Coast rival and singles titlist at the U.S. Championships in 1904, pushed Wightman hard in the 1911 singles final before Wightman prevailed 8\u201310, 6\u20134, 9\u20137.\n\nThe most remarkable comeback in Wightman's career came at the singles final of the 1911 [[Niagara International Tennis Tournament]] against Sutton. After losing the first set 0\u20136 and going down 1\u20135 in the second, she won 12 straight games and the title 0\u20136, 7\u20135, 6\u20130.<ref name=ohnsorg/>\n\nIn 1912, Wightman married Bostonian George Wightman and did not defend her U.S. titles. However, responding to a challenge from her father to win after becoming a mother, which would be a U.S. first, she played again in 1915, losing the singles final to [[Molla Bjurstedt Mallory]] but winning the women's doubles and mixed doubles titles. At age 32, she won her fourth singles title with the loss of only one set, beating [[Marion Zinderstein]] 6\u20131, 6\u20132 in the final. She also reached the women's doubles final. Thereafter, her success (U.S. adult titles between 1909 and 1943) was limited to doubles.<ref name=ohnsorg/>\n\nWightman envisioned a team tournament for women similar to the [[Davis Cup]] and offered a silver vase as prize. In 1923, the British and Americans had the strongest women players. So, [[Julian Myrick]] of the [[United States Tennis Association|United States Lawn Tennis Association]] decided that a U.S.-Britain competition would be in order for the [[Wightman Cup]]. The event, with Wightman captaining and playing for a winning U.S. side, opened the newly constructed stadium at Forest Hills, New York. A treasured series, it lasted through 1989, disbanding when the event was no longer competitive.\n\nWightman, devoted to the game in all aspects, generously instructed innumerable players at no charge throughout her life. She also teamed with two of her prot\u00e9g\u00e9es who later joined her in the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] to win important titles: [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], U.S., and Olympic doubles titles with [[Helen Wills Moody]] in 1924 and U.S. Indoor women's doubles titles with [[Sarah Palfrey Cooke]] from 1928 through 1931. Her second Olympic gold medal in 1924 came in mixed doubles with [[R. Norris Williams|Dick Williams]].\n\nThe last of Wightman's record 34 U.S. adult titles was recorded in 1943 as she, 56, and [[Pauline Betz Addie]] won the women's doubles title at the [[US Indoors|U.S. Indoor Championships]] over [[Lillian Lopaus]] and [[Judy Atterbury]], 7\u20135, 6\u20131.\n\nWightman was included in the year-end top 10 rankings issued by the [[United States Tennis Association|United States Lawn Tennis Association]] in 1915, 1918, and 1919 and was the top ranked U.S. player in 1919 (rankings began in 1913).<ref>{{cite book |author=United States Tennis Association |title=1988 Official USTA Tennis Yearbook |publisher=H.O.

Empire|CBE]] (n\u00e9e Hotchkiss; December 20, 1886 \u2013 December 5, 1974) was an American [[tennis]] player and founder of the [[Wightman Cup]], an annual team competition for British and American women. She dominated American women's tennis before World War I, and won 45 U.S. titles during her life.\n\n==Personal life==\nWightman was born Hazel Virginia Hotchkiss in Healdsburg, California to William Joseph and Emma Lucretia (Grove) Hotchkiss. In February 1912, at the age of 25, she married George William Wightman of Boston. Her father-in-law, George Henry Wightman, was a leader in the steel industry, as an associate of [[Andrew Carnegie]], and one of the country's foremost pioneers of amateur tennis.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1937/04/21/94357643.html?pageNumber=23 |newspaper=New York Times |title=Geo.

She died at her home in the village of Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts on December 5, 1974.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1974/12/06/87613210.html?pageNumber=42|newspaper=New York Times |date=March 6, 1974 |author=Alfred E. Clark |title=Hazel Hotchkiss Wightman Dies; Holder of Tennis Titles was 86}}</ref>\n\nIn 1973, Queen Elizabeth II made her an honorary [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]].\n\n==Career highlights==\nWightman dominated American women's tennis before World War I and had an unparalleled reputation for sportsmanship. Wightman won a lifetime total of 45 U.S. titles, the last at age 68. She won 16 titles overall at the [[U.S. Open (tennis)|U.S. Championships]], four of them in singles (1909\u201311, 1919). Nine of her titles at the U.S. Championships came from 1909 to 1911, when she swept the singles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles competitions three consecutive years.<ref>{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Bud|title=The Bud Collins History of Tennis|year=2010|publisher=New Chapter Press|location=[New York]|isbn=978-0942257700|edition=2nd|pages=467, 468, 479, 481}}</ref>\n\nWightman is known as the \"Queen Mother of American Tennis\" or \"Lady Tennis\" for her lifelong participation in and promotion of women's tennis and because she was instrumental in organizing the Ladies International Tennis Challenge between British and American women's teams, better known as the [[Wightman Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Hall of Famers \u2013 Hazel Hotchkiss Wightman|url=http://www.tennisfame.com/hall-of-famers/inductees/hazel-hotchkiss-wightman|publisher=International Tennis Hall of Fame|accessdate=22 September 2012}}</ref> The cup first was held in 1923 and continued through 1989. She played five years on the American team and was the captain of the American team from inception of the competition through 1948. The cup was composed of five singles and two doubles matches. The cup itself was donated in 1923 by Wightman in honor of her husband. The first contest at Forest Hills, New York on August 11 and 13, 1923 was won by the United States.\n\nBorn during the early days of American tennis, Wightman was a frail and awkward child. Her doctor recommended that she take up a sport to strengthen herself. Her brother suggested tennis as it was considered a \"genteel\" sport. Wightman learned to play at the nearby courts of the University of California, Berkeley where she graduated in 1911. Her rivalry with fellow Californian, [[May Sutton]], shaped a new women's game, with Wightman attacking the net to counter Sutton's dominating forehand.<ref name=ohnsorg>{{cite book|last=Ohnsorg|first=Roger W.|title=Robert Lindley Murray: The Reluctant U.S. Tennis Champion; includes \"The First Forty Years of American Tennis\"|publisher=Trafford On Demand Pub|location=Victoria, BC|isbn=978-1-4269-4514-4|page=47}}</ref>\n\nWightman devoted herself to teaching young people, opening her home near Boston's [[Longwood Cricket Club]] to aspiring champions. In recognition of Wightman's contributions to tennis, the [[United States Tennis Association#Awards|USTA Service Bowl]] was donated in her honor. In 1973, Wightman was appointed as an honorary Commander of the [[Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire|Order of the British Empire]].<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1913&dat=19730825&id=uqMgAAAAIBAJ&sjid=p2gFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1056,3618634&hl=en \"You would like to be served this time\"], Lewiston Evening journal, 25 August 1973</ref><ref>[https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/wi/hazel-wightman-1.html Olympic profile of Hazel Wightman], Sports-Reference.com</ref>\n\n*17 [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] titles (4 singles, 7 women's doubles, 6 mixed doubles)\n*Won all three titles at the U.S. Championships: 1909\u20131911\n*Won singles title at the U.S. Championships: 1909\u20131911, 1919\n*Runner-up in singles at the U.S. Championships: 1915\n*Won women's doubles title at the U.S. Championships: 1909\u20131911, 1915, 1924, 1928\n*Runner-up in women's doubles at the U.S. Championships: 1919, 1923\n*Won mixed doubles title at the U.S. Championships: 1909\u20131911, 1915, 1918, 1920\n*Runner-up in mixed doubles at the U.S. Championships: 1926\n*Won women's doubles title at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]]: 1924\n*Olympic gold medalist in women's doubles and mixed doubles: 1924\n*Won singles title at the [[US Indoors|U.S. Indoor Championships]]: 1919, 1927\n*Won women's doubles title at the U.S. Indoor Championships: 1919, 1921, 1924, 1927\u20131931, 1933, 1943\n*Runner-up in women's doubles at the U.S. Indoor Championships: 1923, 1926, 1932, 1941, 1946\n*Won mixed doubles title at the U.S. Indoor Championships: 1923, 1924, 1926\u20131928\n*Won doubles title at the U.S. Grass Court Championships (for age 40 and over): 1940\u20131942, 1944, 1946\u20131950, 1952, 1954\n*U.S. Wightman Cup team member: 1923, 1924, 1927, 1929, 1931\n*U.S. Wightman Cup team captain: 1923, 1924, 1927, 1929, 1931, 1933, 1935, 1937\u20131939, 1946\u20131948\n*Winner of USTA Service Bowl, donated in Wightman's honor: 1940, 1946\n*Author of ''Better Tennis''\n*Coached several women champions, including [[Sarah Palfrey Cooke]], [[Helen Wills Moody]], and [[Helen Jacobs]]\n*Inducted into the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] in 1957\n*Appointed as an Honorary [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1973\n*Inducted into the [[International Women's Sports Hall of Fame]] in 1986\n*First honoree in the University of California women's athlete hall of fame\n\n==Career in depth==\n[[File:Hazel Hotchkiss cropped.jpg|thumb]]\nThough short in stature, Wightman anticipated and moved extremely well around a tennis court. She perfected her volleying style early, hitting the ball against the family home in Berkeley, California, where she grew up and graduated from the University of California. She refused to let the ball bounce because the yard was so uneven. She used to play against her four brothers and then the proud and spiky Sutton sisters.\n\nWightman was a shy, somewhat awed, and fascinated 22-year-old college girl when she arrived at the Philadelphia Cricket Club in 1909 for the [[U.S. Open (tennis)|U.S. Championships]]. She never before played on grass, but she used her attacking style and rock-ribbed volleying\u2014she was the first woman to rely so heavily on the volley\u2014to win the all-comers final over [[Louise Hammond Raymond|Louise Hammond]] 6\u20138, 6\u20131, 6\u20134 and then the title over 39-year-old [[Maud Barger-Wallach]] 6\u20130, 6\u20131. Wightman also won the women's doubles and mixed doubles titles that year.\n\nIn the 1910 Washington State Championships, Wightman won one of the few recorded \"Golden Matches\" in which the winner did not lose a point. She defeated a Miss Huiskamp (first name unknown).<ref>''All-Time Records'', [[Tennis (magazine)|Tennis Magazine]], February 1981, page 72</ref>\n\nWightman successfully defended all three titles at the U.S. Championships in 1910 and 1911. Wightman easily defeated Hammond in the 1910 singles final. [[May Sutton]], an old West Coast rival and singles titlist at the U.S. Championships in 1904, pushed Wightman hard in the 1911 singles final before Wightman prevailed 8\u201310, 6\u20134, 9\u20137.\n\nThe most remarkable comeback in Wightman's career came at the singles final of the 1911 [[Niagara International Tennis Tournament]] against Sutton. After losing the first set 0\u20136 and going down 1\u20135 in the second, she won 12 straight games and the title 0\u20136, 7\u20135, 6\u20130.<ref name=ohnsorg/>\n\nIn 1912, Wightman married Bostonian George Wightman and did not defend her U.S. titles. However, responding to a challenge from her father to win after becoming a mother, which would be a U.S. first, she played again in 1915, losing the singles final to [[Molla Bjurstedt Mallory]] but winning the women's doubles and mixed doubles titles. At age 32, she won her fourth singles title with the loss of only one set, beating [[Marion Zinderstein]] 6\u20131, 6\u20132 in the final. She also reached the women's doubles final. Thereafter, her success (U.S. adult titles between 1909 and 1943) was limited to doubles.<ref name=ohnsorg/>\n\nWightman envisioned a team tournament for women similar to the [[Davis Cup]] and offered a silver vase as prize. In 1923, the British and Americans had the strongest women players. So, [[Julian Myrick]] of the [[United States Tennis Association|United States Lawn Tennis Association]] decided that a U.S.-Britain competition would be in order for the [[Wightman Cup]]. The event, with Wightman captaining and playing for a winning U.S. side, opened the newly constructed stadium at Forest Hills, New York. A treasured series, it lasted through 1989, disbanding when the event was no longer competitive.\n\nWightman, devoted to the game in all aspects, generously instructed innumerable players at no charge throughout her life. She also teamed with two of her prot\u00e9g\u00e9es who later joined her in the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] to win important titles: [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], U.S., and Olympic doubles titles with [[Helen Wills Moody]] in 1924 and U.S. Indoor women's doubles titles with [[Sarah Palfrey Cooke]] from 1928 through 1931.

During a festival she meets Ignacio, an aspiring gentleman applying for a position in the Spanish civil service. They begin a relationship and soon decide to marry. Meanwhile, Dona Manuela's business is running slow, leaving her with no other option but to close down the shop, leaving all the seamstresses, including Sira and her mother, unemployed and fully reliant on Ignacio's prestigious position as a civil servant. Sira remains unemployed until Ignacio finally convinces her to apply for a civil service post, but to do this she must learn to use a typewriter.\n\nAt the typewriter shop, she falls in love with the handsome Ramiro Arribas, which puts her in a difficult predicament. After a while, unable to cope with the guilt of marrying Ignacio, she tells him she has been seeing Ramiro. Ignacio is heartbroken. He tells Dolores  about Sira's betrayal, and her mother disowns her. Sira moves in with Ramiro. After months, Dolores finds Sira with news that her long-lost father has asked to see her. They visit him together, and Sira discovers that her father is one of the wealthiest men in Madrid, Gonzalo Alvarez. When he showers her with jewels and money, Sira shares her newfound fortune with Ramiro, who suggests investing some of the money in a typewriting company in Argentina. Their investments take them to Tangier, Morocco. Sira sadly leaves her mother behind and takes a leap of faith to set off for Africa with Ramiro.\n\nSoon, Ramiro starts wasting Sira's money on alcohol and tobacco. She has an argument with him about his money management and says she feels alone. The following day she sees a doctor as she is feeling unwell all the time, and discovers she is pregnant. Hopeful this will save her relationship, Sira hurries to their luxury apartment at the International Hotel to break the news to Ramiro, but finds the place ransacked and empty, with a letter from Ramiro saying he has decided to start a different life and has taken all Sira's money and jewels with him. In desperation Sira packs her things, leaves the hotel without a word and gets on a bus out of Tangier. On the journey she has a miscarriage and faints. She wakes up handcuffed in a hospital in Tetuoan and realizes that Ramiro never paid their bills at the hotel, leaving her with a debt of almost 2,500 French francs. The hotel gives her a year to pay before she is sent to prison. She is unable to contact her mother or return to Madrid because [[Spanish Civil War|war has broken out there]]. Meanwhile, she is given shelter in Candelaria Matutera's guesthouse.\n\nAs England, Germany, and the other great powers become embroiled in the dire conflict of World War II, Sira is persuaded to return to Madrid, where she takes on a new identity to embark upon the most dangerous undertaking of her career. Thanks to her workshop, Sira meets important people like [[Juan Luis Beigbeder y Atienza|Juan Luis Beigbeder]], the High Commissioner of the Protectorate; Beigbeder's mistress Rosalinda Fox, who becomes a close friend to Sira; [[Ram\u00f3n Serrano Su\u00f1er]], [[Francisco Franco]]'s brother-in-law; and [[Alan Hillgarth]], head of the British intelligence service in Spain. These people encourage Sira to become a spy, using the skills of her trade for more dangerous tasks. As the couturier of choice for an eager clientele of Nazi officers' wives, Sira becomes embroiled in a twilight world of espionage and political conspiracy rife with love, intrigue, and betrayal.\n\n==Production==\nThe series was filmed in various locations in Spain, [[Morocco]] and [[Portugal]]. [[Mar\u00eda Due\u00f1as]]' original novel is set in [[Madrid]], [[Tangier]], [[T\u00e9touan]] and [[Lisbon]]. Most of scenes in the series were filmed in these cities.

During a festival she meets Ignacio, an aspiring gentleman applying for a position in the Spanish civil service. They begin a relationship and soon decide to marry. Meanwhile, Dona Manuela's business is running slow, leaving her with no other option but to close down the shop, leaving all the seamstresses, including Sira and her mother, unemployed and fully reliant on Ignacio's prestigious position as a civil servant. Sira remains unemployed until Ignacio finally convinces her to apply for a civil service post, but to do this she must learn to use a typewriter.\n\nAt the typewriter shop, she falls in love with the handsome Ramiro Arribas, which puts her in a difficult predicament. After a while, unable to cope with the guilt of marrying Ignacio, she tells him she has been seeing Ramiro. Ignacio is heartbroken. He tells Dolores  about Sira's betrayal, and her mother disowns her. Sira moves in with Ramiro. After months, Dolores finds Sira with news that her long-lost father has asked to see her. They visit him together, and Sira discovers that her father is one of the wealthiest men in Madrid, Gonzalo Alvarez. When he showers her with jewels and money, Sira shares her newfound fortune with Ramiro, who suggests investing some of the money in a typewriting company in Argentina. Their investments take them to Tangier, Morocco. Sira sadly leaves her mother behind and takes a leap of faith to set off for Africa with Ramiro.\n\nSoon, Ramiro starts wasting Sira's money on alcohol and tobacco. She has an argument with him about his money management and says she feels alone. The following day she sees a doctor as she is feeling unwell all the time, and discovers she is pregnant. Hopeful this will save her relationship, Sira hurries to their luxury apartment at the International Hotel to break the news to Ramiro, but finds the place ransacked and empty, with a letter from Ramiro saying he has decided to start a different life and has taken all Sira's money and jewels with him. In desperation Sira packs her things, leaves the hotel without a word and gets on a bus out of Tangier. On the journey she has a miscarriage and faints. She wakes up handcuffed in a hospital in Tetuoan and realizes that Ramiro never paid their bills at the hotel, leaving her with a debt of almost 2,500 French francs. The hotel gives her a year to pay before she is sent to prison. She is unable to contact her mother or return to Madrid because [[Spanish Civil War|war has broken out there]]. Meanwhile, she is given shelter in Candelaria Matutera's guesthouse.\n\nAs England, Germany, and the other great powers become embroiled in the dire conflict of World War II, Sira is persuaded to return to Madrid, where she takes on a new identity to embark upon the most dangerous undertaking of her career. Thanks to her workshop, Sira meets important people like [[Juan Luis Beigbeder y Atienza|Juan Luis Beigbeder]], the High Commissioner of the Protectorate; Beigbeder's mistress Rosalinda Fox, who becomes a close friend to Sira; [[Ram\u00f3n Serrano Su\u00f1er]], [[Francisco Franco]]'s brother-in-law; and [[Alan Hillgarth]], head of the British intelligence service in Spain. These people encourage Sira to become a spy, using the skills of her trade for more dangerous tasks. As the couturier of choice for an eager clientele of Nazi officers' wives, Sira becomes embroiled in a twilight world of espionage and political conspiracy rife with love, intrigue, and betrayal.\n\n==Production==\nThe series was filmed in various locations in Spain, [[Morocco]] and [[Portugal]]. [[Mar\u00eda Due\u00f1as]]' original novel is set in [[Madrid]], [[Tangier]], [[T\u00e9touan]] and [[Lisbon]]. Most of scenes in the series were filmed in these cities. Some of the scenes were filmed in [[Guadalajara, Castile-La Mancha|Guadalajara]] and [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] in Spain, and [[Estoril]] and [[Cascais]] in Portugal. The budget was estimated in over 500,000 [[euro]]s per episode.<ref>[http://www.vertele.com/noticias/pros-y-contras-de-el-tiempo-entre-costuras-antes-de-su-estreno-en-antena-3/ M\u00e1s de medio mill\u00f3n de euros por cap\u00edtulo] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021074909/http://www.vertele.com/noticias/pros-y-contras-de-el-tiempo-entre-costuras-antes-de-su-estreno-en-antena-3/ |date=October 21, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n*[[Adriana Ugarte]] as Sira Quiroga ''aka'' Sira Alvarado Quiroga ''aka'' Arish Agoriuq\n*[[Elvira M\u00ednguez]] as Dolores Quiroga\n*[[Ra\u00fal Ar\u00e9valo]] as Ignacio\n*[[Trist\u00e1n Ulloa]] as [[Juan Luis Beigbeder y Atienza|Juan Luis Beigbeder]]\n*[[Hannah New]] as Rosalinda Fox\n*[[Peter Vives]] as Marcus Logan\n*Carlos Santos as F\u00e9lix Aranda\n*Francesc Garrido as Claudio V\u00e1zquez\n*Filipe Duarte as Manuel Da Silva\n*Mari Carmen S\u00e1nchez as Candelaria \"La Matutera\"\n*[[Rub\u00e9n Cortada]] as Ramiro Arribas\n*Carlos Serrano as Ramiro Arribas (voice)\n*[[Pepa Rus]] as Paquita\n*Elena Irureta as Do\u00f1a Manolita\n*[[Alba Flores]] as Jamila\n*Carlos Olalla as Gonzalo Alvarado\n*Ben Temple as [[Alan Hillgarth]]\n*David Muro as Palomares\n*Jimmy Shaw as Peter Fox\n*[[Enrique Arce]] as Andr\u00e9s\n*Aurora Maestre as Do\u00f1a Encarna\n*\u00c1ngela Romanillos as Sira Quiroga (child)\n\n==Soundtrack==\nMusic score was composed by [[C\u00e9sar Benito]].

That entire book was, in turn, included within his much-reprinted ''[[Ficciones]]'' ([[1944 in literature|1944]]). Two [[English language|English-language]] [[translation]]s appeared approximately simultaneously in [[1962 in literature|1962]], one by James E. Irby in a diverse collection of Borges's works titled ''[[Labyrinths]]'' and the other by Anthony Kerrigan as part of a collaborative translation of the entirety of ''Ficciones''.\n\n==Plot==\nBorges' narrator describes how his universe consists of an enormous expanse of adjacent [[hexagon]]al rooms. In each room, there is an entrance on one wall, the bare necessities for human survival on another wall, and four walls of bookshelves. Though the order and content of the books are random and apparently completely meaningless, the inhabitants believe that the books contain every possible ordering of just 25 basic [[grapheme|characters]] (22 letters, the period, the comma, and space). Though the vast majority of the books in this universe are pure gibberish, the library also must contain, somewhere, every coherent book ever written, or that might ever be written, and every possible [[permutation]] or slightly erroneous version of every one of those books. The narrator notes that the library must contain all useful information, including predictions of the future, biographies of any person, and translations of every book in all [[language]]s. Conversely, for many of the texts, some language could be devised that would make it readable with any of a vast number of different contents.\n\nDespite\u2014indeed, because of\u2014this glut of information, all books are totally useless to the reader, leaving the librarians in a state of suicidal despair. This leads some librarians to [[superstitious]] and [[cult]]-like behaviors, such as the \"Purifiers\", who arbitrarily destroy books they deem nonsense as they scour through the library seeking the \"Crimson Hexagon\" and its illustrated, magical books. Others believe that since all books exist in the library, somewhere one of the books must be a perfect index of the library's contents; some even believe that a messianic figure known as the \"Man of the Book\" has read it, and they travel through the library seeking him.\n\n==Themes==\n[[File:Jorge Luis Borges.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Borges in 1976]]\nThe story repeats the theme of Borges' [[1939 in literature|1939]] essay \"[[The Total Library]]\" (\"La Biblioteca Total\"), which in turn acknowledges the earlier development of this theme by [[Kurd Lasswitz]] in his [[1901 in literature|1901]] story \"The Universal Library\" (\"Die Universalbibliothek\"):\n\n<blockquote>Certain examples that [[Aristotle]] attributes to [[Democritus]] and [[Leucippus]] clearly prefigure it, but its belated inventor is [[Gustav Theodor Fechner]], and its first exponent, [[Kurd Lasswitz]]. [...] In his book ''The Race with the Tortoise'' (Berlin, 1919), Dr [[Theodor Wolff]] suggests that it is a derivation from, or a parody of, [[Ram\u00f3n Llull]]'s thinking machine [...T]he elements of his game are the universal orthographic symbols, not the words of a language [...] Lasswitz arrives at twenty-five symbols (twenty-two letters, the space, the period, the comma), whose recombinations and repetitions encompass everything possible to express in all languages. The totality of such variations would form a Total Library of astronomical size. Lasswitz urges mankind to construct that inhuman library, which chance would organize and which would eliminate intelligence. (Wolff's ''The Race with the Tortoise'' expounds the execution and the dimensions of that impossible enterprise.)<ref>Borges, Jorge Luis. ''The Total Library: Non-Fiction 1922\u20131986.''

Translated by Eliot Weinberger.</ref></blockquote>\n\nMany of Borges' signature motifs are featured in the story, including [[infinity]], [[reality]], [[Kabbalah|cabalistic reasoning]], and [[labyrinth]]s. The concept of the library is often compared to [[Infinite monkey theorem|Borel's dactylographic monkey theorem]]. There is no reference to monkeys or typewriters in \"The Library of Babel\", although Borges had mentioned that analogy in \"The Total Library\": \"[A] half-dozen monkeys provided with typewriters would, in a few eternities, produce all the books in the British Museum.\" In this story, the closest equivalent is the line, \"A blasphemous sect suggested [...] that all men should juggle letters and symbols until they constructed, by an improbable gift of chance, these canonical books.\"\n\nBorges would examine a similar idea in his 1975 story, \"[[The Book of Sand]]\" in which there is an infinite book (or book with an indefinite number of pages) rather than an infinite library. Moreover, the story's ''Book of Sand'' is said to be written in an unknown alphabet and its content is not obviously random. In The Library of Babel, Borges interpolates Italian mathematician [[Bonaventura Cavalieri]]'s suggestion that any solid body could be conceptualized as the superimposition of an infinite number of planes.\n\nThe concept of the library is also overtly analogous to the view of the universe as a [[sphere]] having its center everywhere and its [[circumference]] nowhere. The [[mathematician]] and [[philosopher]] [[Blaise Pascal]] employed this [[metaphor]], and in an earlier essay Borges noted that Pascal's manuscript called the sphere ''effroyable,'' or \"frightful\".\n\nIn any case, a library containing ''all'' possible books, arranged at random, might as well be a library containing ''zero'' books, as any true information would be buried in, and rendered indistinguishable from, all possible forms of false information; the experience of opening to any page of any of the library's books has been simulated by websites which create screenfuls of random letters.<ref>See https://libraryofbabel.info/</ref>\n\nThe quote at the beginning of the story, \"By this art you may contemplate the variation of the twenty-three letters,\" is from [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]]'s 1621 ''[[The Anatomy of Melancholy]]''.\n\n==Philosophical implications==\nThere are numerous philosophical implications within the idea of the finite library which exhausts all possibilities. Every book in the library is \"intelligible\" if one decodes it correctly, simply because it can be decoded from any other book in the library using a third book as a [[one-time pad]]. This lends itself to the philosophical idea proposed by [[Immanuel Kant]], that our mind helps to structure our experience of reality; thus the rules of reality (as we know it) are intrinsic to the mind. So if we identify these rules, we can better decode 'reality'. One might speculate that these rules are contained in the crimson hexagon room which is the key to decoding the others. The library becomes a temptation, even an obsession, because it contains these gems of enlightenment while also burying them in deception. On a psychological level, the infinite storehouse of information is a hindrance and a distraction, because it lures one away from writing one's own book (i.e. living one's life). Anything one might write would of course already exist. One can see any text as being pulled from the library by the act of the author defining the search letter by letter until they reach a text close enough to the one they intended to write. The text already existed theoretically, but had to be found by the act of the author's imagination.<ref name=Kelly1994>{{citation|title=Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World|year=1994|author=Kelly, Kevin|isbn=978-0-201-48340-6|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/outofcontrolnewb00kell}}</ref> Another implication is an argument against certain proofs of the [[existence of God]], as it is carried out by [[David Hume]] using the thought experiment of a similar library of books generated not by human mind, but by nature.<ref name=Hume1779>{{citation|title=Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion Part 3|year=1779|author=Hume, David}}</ref>\n\n===Infinite extent===\nIn mainstream theories of natural language syntax, every syntactically-valid utterance can be extended to produce a new, longer one, because of [[Recursion#In_language|recursion]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Aspects of the theory of syntax|author=Noam, Chomsky|year=1969|orig-year=1965|publisher=M.I.T.

Borges' narrator notes this fact, but believes that the Library is nevertheless infinite; he speculates that it repeats itself periodically, giving an eventual \"order\" to the \"disorder\" of the seemingly-random arrangement of books.\n\n===Quine's reduction===\nIn a short essay, [[W.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;O. Quine]] noted the interesting fact that the Library of Babel is finite (that is, we will theoretically come to a point in history where everything has been written), and that the Library of Babel can be constructed in its entirety simply by writing a dot on one piece of paper and a dash on another. These two sheets of paper could then be alternated at random to produce every possible text, in [[Morse code]] or equivalently [[binary code|binary]]. Writes Quine, \"The ultimate absurdity is now staring us in the face: a universal library of two volumes, one containing a single dot and the other a dash. Persistent repetition and alternation of the two are sufficient, we well know, for spelling out any and every truth. The miracle of the finite but universal library is a mere inflation of the miracle of binary notation: everything worth saying, and everything else as well, can be said with two characters.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jubal.westnet.com/hyperdiscordia/universal_library.html|title=Universal Library|author=W.V.O Quine|accessdate=May 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Comparison with biology==\nThe full possible set of protein sequences ([[sequence space (evolution)|protein sequence space]]) has been compared to the Library of Babel.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Arnold, FH|title=The Library of Maynard-Smith: My Search for Meaning in the protein universe|journal=Advances in Protein Chemistry|date=2000|volume=55|pages=ix\u2013xi|pmid=11050930}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ostermeier|first1=M|title=Beyond cataloging the Library of Babel.|journal=Chemistry & Biology|date=March 2007|volume=14|issue=3|pages=237\u20138|pmid=17379136|doi=10.1016/j.chembiol.2007.03.002|doi-access=free}}</ref> In the ''Library of Babel'', finding any book that made sense was impossible due to the sheer number and lack of order. The same would be true of protein sequences if it were not for natural selection, which has picked out only protein sequences that make sense. Additionally, each protein sequence is surrounded by a set of neighbors (point mutants) that are likely to have at least some function. [[Daniel Dennett]]'s 1995 book ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]'' includes an elaboration of the Library of Babel concept to imagine the set of all possible genetic sequences, which he calls the Library of Mendel, in order to illustrate the mathematics of genetic variation. Dennett uses this concept again later in the book to imagine all possible algorithms that can be included in his Toshiba computer, which he calls the Library of Toshiba. He describes the Library of Mendel and the Library of Toshiba as subsets within the Library of Babel.\n\n==Influence on later writers==\n*[[Umberto Eco]]'s postmodern novel ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'' (1980) features a labyrinthine library, presided over by a blind monk named Jorge of Burgos. The aedificium is, however, octagonal in shape.\n*In \"The Net of Babel\", published in ''[[Interzone (magazine)|Interzone]]'' in 1995, [[David Langford]] imagines the Library becoming [[computer]]ized for easy access. This aids the librarians in searching for specific text while also highlighting the futility of such searches as they can find anything, but nothing of meaning as such. The sequel continues many of Borges's themes, while also highlighting the difference between [[data]] and [[information]], and [[satire|satirizing]] the [[Internet]].\n*[[Russell K. Standish|Russell Standish]]'s ''Theory of Nothing''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hpcoders.com.au/nothing.html|title=Theory of Nothing|publisher=Hpcoders.com.au|date=May 29, 2011|accessdate=May 10, 2018}}</ref> uses the concept of the Library of Babel to illustrate how an [[ultimate ensemble]] containing all possible descriptions would in sum contain zero information and would thus be the simplest possible explanation for the existence of the universe. This theory, therefore, implies the reality of all universes.\n*[[Michael Ende]] reused the idea of a universe of hexagonal rooms in the ''Temple of a Thousand Doors'' from ''[[The Neverending Story]]'', which contained all the possible characteristics of doors in the fantastic realm. A later chapter features the [[infinite monkey theorem]].\n*[[Terry Pratchett]] uses the concept of the infinite library in his ''[[Discworld]]'' novels. The knowledgeable librarian is a human wizard transformed into an orangutan.\n*''The Unimaginable Mathematics of Borges' Library of Babel'' (2008) by [[William Goldbloom Bloch]] explores the short story from a mathematical perspective. Bloch analyzes the hypothetical library presented by Borges using the ideas of topology, information theory, and geometry.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bloch, William Goldbloom|title=The Unimaginable Mathematics of Borges' Library of Babel |year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://wheatoncollege.edu/academics/faculty-directory/bill-goldbloom-bloch/|title=William Goldbloom Bloch's home page|publisher=Faculty.wheatoncollege.edu|accessdate=May 10, 2018}}</ref>\n*In [[Greg Bear]]'s novel ''[[City at the End of Time]]'' (2008), the sum-runners carried by the protagonists are intended by their creator to be combined to form a 'Babel', an infinite library containing every possible permutation of every possible character in every possible language. Bear has stated that this was inspired by Borges, who is also namechecked in the novel. Borges is described as an unknown Argentinian who commissioned an encyclopedia of impossible things, a reference to either \"[[Tl\u00f6n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]\" or the ''[[Book of Imaginary Beings]]''.\n*''Fone'', a short comic novel drawn by [[Milo Manara]], features a human astronaut and his alien partner stranded on a planet named Borges Profeta. The planet is overflowed by books containing all the possible permutations of letters.\n*[[Steven L. Peck]] wrote a novella entitled ''A Short Stay in Hell'' (2012) in which the protagonist must find the book containing his life story in an afterlife replica of Borges' Library of Babel.\n*The third season of ''Carmilla'', a Canadian single-frame web series based on the novella by [[Sheridan Le Fanu|J. Sheridan Le Fanu]], is set in a mystical library described as \"non-Euclidean\" and omnipotent.  It contains a door that, depending on the knocking pattern on its panels, can be opened into any universe. It also creates a temporary parallel universe and is able to shift a character between the parallel and the original.  As the parallel universe collapses, darkness falls, and a character perishes in the void after uttering the words, \"O time thy pyramids,\" which are contained on the second-to-last page of a book in the Library of Babel.\n*In [[Christopher Nolan]]'s film [[Interstellar (film)|''Interstellar'']], the protagonist, Cooper, played by [[Matthew McConaughey]], becomes trapped in a black hole which mirrors the Library of Babel; Cooper's universe consists of an infinitely extended [[tesseract]] consisting of the back-side of a specific bookshelf full of books in his former family home in all directions, but at different times in the bookshelf's history.

[[Daniel Dennett]]'s 1995 book ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]'' includes an elaboration of the Library of Babel concept to imagine the set of all possible genetic sequences, which he calls the Library of Mendel, in order to illustrate the mathematics of genetic variation. Dennett uses this concept again later in the book to imagine all possible algorithms that can be included in his Toshiba computer, which he calls the Library of Toshiba. He describes the Library of Mendel and the Library of Toshiba as subsets within the Library of Babel.\n\n==Influence on later writers==\n*[[Umberto Eco]]'s postmodern novel ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'' (1980) features a labyrinthine library, presided over by a blind monk named Jorge of Burgos. The aedificium is, however, octagonal in shape.\n*In \"The Net of Babel\", published in ''[[Interzone (magazine)|Interzone]]'' in 1995, [[David Langford]] imagines the Library becoming [[computer]]ized for easy access. This aids the librarians in searching for specific text while also highlighting the futility of such searches as they can find anything, but nothing of meaning as such. The sequel continues many of Borges's themes, while also highlighting the difference between [[data]] and [[information]], and [[satire|satirizing]] the [[Internet]].\n*[[Russell K. Standish|Russell Standish]]'s ''Theory of Nothing''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hpcoders.com.au/nothing.html|title=Theory of Nothing|publisher=Hpcoders.com.au|date=May 29, 2011|accessdate=May 10, 2018}}</ref> uses the concept of the Library of Babel to illustrate how an [[ultimate ensemble]] containing all possible descriptions would in sum contain zero information and would thus be the simplest possible explanation for the existence of the universe. This theory, therefore, implies the reality of all universes.\n*[[Michael Ende]] reused the idea of a universe of hexagonal rooms in the ''Temple of a Thousand Doors'' from ''[[The Neverending Story]]'', which contained all the possible characteristics of doors in the fantastic realm. A later chapter features the [[infinite monkey theorem]].\n*[[Terry Pratchett]] uses the concept of the infinite library in his ''[[Discworld]]'' novels. The knowledgeable librarian is a human wizard transformed into an orangutan.\n*''The Unimaginable Mathematics of Borges' Library of Babel'' (2008) by [[William Goldbloom Bloch]] explores the short story from a mathematical perspective. Bloch analyzes the hypothetical library presented by Borges using the ideas of topology, information theory, and geometry.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bloch, William Goldbloom|title=The Unimaginable Mathematics of Borges' Library of Babel |year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://wheatoncollege.edu/academics/faculty-directory/bill-goldbloom-bloch/|title=William Goldbloom Bloch's home page|publisher=Faculty.wheatoncollege.edu|accessdate=May 10, 2018}}</ref>\n*In [[Greg Bear]]'s novel ''[[City at the End of Time]]'' (2008), the sum-runners carried by the protagonists are intended by their creator to be combined to form a 'Babel', an infinite library containing every possible permutation of every possible character in every possible language. Bear has stated that this was inspired by Borges, who is also namechecked in the novel. Borges is described as an unknown Argentinian who commissioned an encyclopedia of impossible things, a reference to either \"[[Tl\u00f6n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]\" or the ''[[Book of Imaginary Beings]]''.\n*''Fone'', a short comic novel drawn by [[Milo Manara]], features a human astronaut and his alien partner stranded on a planet named Borges Profeta. The planet is overflowed by books containing all the possible permutations of letters.\n*[[Steven L. Peck]] wrote a novella entitled ''A Short Stay in Hell'' (2012) in which the protagonist must find the book containing his life story in an afterlife replica of Borges' Library of Babel.\n*The third season of ''Carmilla'', a Canadian single-frame web series based on the novella by [[Sheridan Le Fanu|J. Sheridan Le Fanu]], is set in a mystical library described as \"non-Euclidean\" and omnipotent.  It contains a door that, depending on the knocking pattern on its panels, can be opened into any universe. It also creates a temporary parallel universe and is able to shift a character between the parallel and the original.  As the parallel universe collapses, darkness falls, and a character perishes in the void after uttering the words, \"O time thy pyramids,\" which are contained on the second-to-last page of a book in the Library of Babel.\n*In [[Christopher Nolan]]'s film [[Interstellar (film)|''Interstellar'']], the protagonist, Cooper, played by [[Matthew McConaughey]], becomes trapped in a black hole which mirrors the Library of Babel; Cooper's universe consists of an infinitely extended [[tesseract]] consisting of the back-side of a specific bookshelf full of books in his former family home in all directions, but at different times in the bookshelf's history. This scene has been compared to the Library of Babel,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/reviews-recommendations/review-interstellar|author=Pinkerton, Nick|title=Review: Interstellar|date=July 21, 2017|accessdate=May 10, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2014/11/13/363444786/the-science-of-interstellar|title=The Science Of 'Interstellar'|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=November 13, 2014|accessdate=May 10, 2018}}</ref> and Nolan cites Borges as an artistic influence.<ref>{{cite news|work=[[The Atlantic]]|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/382636/|title=Interstellar Isn't About Religion (and Also It Is Totally About Religion)|author=Garber, Megan|date=November 12, 2014|accessdate=May 10, 2018}}</ref>\n*Jonathan Basile simulates an English-language version of Borges' library on the art website [http://libraryofbabel.info ''LibraryOfBabel.info''].

It is the fifteenth entry of the ''[[Super Sentai]]'' [[metaseries]], following the previous series ''[[Chikyu Sentai Fiveman]]''. The series aired on [[TV Asahi]] on February 15, 1991 to February 14, 1992, with a total of 51 episodes. It is the first Sentai series where the Blue and Yellow Rangers switch genders in the three male/two female team (the male wears yellow and the female wears blue), which would not occur again until ''[[Mahou Sentai Magiranger]]''. It is also the last Sentai series until ''[[Ressha Sentai ToQger]]'' to not get adapted into a ''[[Power Rangers]]'' series.\n\n[[Shout! Factory]] released ''Jetman'' in North America on September 25, 2018. This is the 10th ''Super Sentai'' to be released in North America and the only one that is non-Power Rangers adapted.\n\n==Plot==\nThis series takes place in 199X.{{refn|group=Note|name=second|The year is only addressed as \"199X\", but is later shown to be 1991, notably through Rie's tombstone.}} On the Earth Ship, the command center of a defence agency called Sky Force, the guardians of peace on Earth, scientists have developed \"Birdonic Waves\", a newly developed technology which gives the subject superhuman abilities. Experiments called \"J-Project\" were successful. Aya Odagiri, the director of the project, chooses five elite Sky Force officials from Earth to use this technology. Ryuu Tendou, one of the Sky Force officers, is successfully exposed to the Birdonic Waves, making him the first Jetman, the Red Hawk.\n\nHowever, the Earth Ship is suddenly attacked by Vyram, an evil outer-dimensional organization bent on inter-dimensional domination. They successfully destroy the ship, apparently killing Ryuu's lover and fellow candidate member Rie. In the chaos, the remaining Birdonic Waves for the other four officials become scattered on Earth, hitting four civilians. Odagiri and Tendou successfully escape and begin searching on Earth for the four remaining Jetmen, training them to aid them in stopping Vyram's plans of conquering their dimension.\n\nThe series later follows the tribulations of Ryuu as he learns of Rie's survival and enlistment in the Vyram forces, as well as a love triangle between Gai, Ryuu, and Kaori.\n\n==Production==\n''Ch\u014djin Sentai Jetman'' is the first Sentai series that paid homage to another show, ''[[Science Ninja Team Gatchaman]]''. Developed before the ending of ''[[Chikyuu Sentai Fiveman]]'', Toei chose [[Keita Amemiya]] to be the series' director.

One of them were Toshihide Wakamatsu who would go on to play Gai Yuuki/Black Condor. Before the series, the members were all referred to by their color but both Amemiya and Suzuki said that \"this [was] unnatural\" and decided the characters to refer each other by their names instead of their colors. Episodes without the characters transforming and fighting were also proposed, but seriously opposed by Bandai until the later half of the series.\n\nThe more mature themes such as drama, romantic love triangles and tragedy were in the series' after Takeyuki Suzuki watched ''[[Tosho Daimos]]'', and wanted to capture its \"high romance\". Both the comedy and dramatic tones influenced the series' overall popularity and had become its defining part.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Earth Defence Force Sky Force===\n{{Nihongo|Earth Defence Force Sky Force|\u5730\u7403\u9632\u885b\u8ecd\u30b9\u30ab\u30a4\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30b9|Chiky\u016b B\u014deigun Sukai F\u014dsu}} is the military organization the Jetmen belong to.\n\n====Jetmen====\nBased at the {{Nihongo|Sky Camp|\u30b9\u30ab\u30a4\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7|Sukai Kyanpu}}, a high-tech base provided by the Sky Force, the Jetman team is formed by five persons who gain superhuman strength through exposure to Birdonic Waves.

This leads to a conflict when he discovers that his beloved Rie has become Maria, eventually coming to terms with the revelation as he resolves to save Rie from the Vyram control. However, Rie's death at the hands of his nemesis Radiguet proves to be the last straw, causing him to challenge Radiguet alone before Kaori consoles Ryuu and encourages him to stay true to his own belief in justice rather than revenge.

Gai loves challenges and risks, and is a womanizer and an avid if occasional gambler. Gai's fighting styles are street fighting and mixed martial arts: his combat skills match Ryuu's, though he fights dirty and hits below the belt sometimes. He initially clashes with the straight-laced Ryuu when drafted against his will but eventually comes to respect Ryuu's largely-principled disposition (Ryuu falters only over the issue of his lost girlfriend, something Gai, being a womanizer, can sympathize with), ultimately becoming friends with him. He loves Kaori and often tries to flirt with her, leading to much frustration due to his initially-unreciprocated feelings. When she finally accepts him, they frequently have problems in their relationship as they are too different. He later develops a rivalry with Vyram general Grey.

She is good at martial arts, and the inventor of the team vehicles. She is both caring and stern to the Jetmen, and she is not above fighting alongside those under her charge and even personally covering their maneuvers if necessary.

She is also an able pilot, having flown Sky Force aircraft and even Jet Garuda on two occasions.\n\nCommander Aya Odagiri is portrayed by {{Nihongo|[[Mikiko Miki]]|\u4e09\u8f1d \u307f\u304d\u3053|Miki Mikiko}}.\n\n=====Supreme Commander Ichijou=====\n{{Nihongo|Supreme Commander Ichijou|\u4e00\u6761\u7dcf\u53f8\u4ee4|Ichij\u014d S\u014dshirei|40 & 41}} : A Sky Force officer who cares only for himself and bears a grudge against Commander Odagiri for being the commanding officer in the Jetmen project, which fell to civilians. With his Neo Jetmen, Ichijou gains appointment to assume command of Sky Camp base, bent on making Odagiri suffer while removing her Jetmen from the picture. However, he subsequently proves himself to be utterly incompetent in his new capacity when Bio-Dimension Beast Meteor BEM infiltrates and wreaks havoc within Sky Camp, being instantly demoralized at the first sign of Meteor BEM gaining the upper hand, refusing to even defend himself when offered the option to do so, and trapping his own Neo Jetmen team (and Commander Odagiri, who is attempting to aid the Neo Jetmen at the time) with the monster in a futile act of desperation.

J1 ([[Y\u016bta Mochizuki]], who later went on to play Geki/Tyranno Ranger in ''[[Ky\u014dry\u016b Sentai Zyuranger]]'') is armed with the Neo Sword, J2 is armed with the Neo Stinger scythe, and J4 is armed with the Neo Slicer boomerang.

While Ray and Kanna working with the Jetmen in their fight against Semimaru, Dan becomes romantically interested at Ako when they meet, causing him to express his feelings in a comical fashion. After Ray and Kanna are killed by Radiguet when he hijacks Jet Garuda, Dan assumes his fighting form and is mortally wounded taking the robot back from Radiguet. He dies soon after Ako expresses her feelings about him.\n*{{Nihongo|Reverse Dimension Berserker Soldiers|\u88cf\u6b21\u5143\u30d9\u30eb\u30bb\u30eb\u30af\u306e\u6226\u58eb|Urajigen Beruseruku no Senshi}} (29): The two warriors from the Berserk region, destroyed by Vyram force under Radiguet whose people can change anything they hold into weapons, though they can give up that very power to save a life instead. Arriving to Earth, while {{Nihongo|Duran|\u30c7\u30e5\u30e9\u30f3|Dyuran}} is cared for by the Jetmen, {{Nihongo|Ru|\u30eb\u30fc|R\u016b}} attempts to kill Radiguet.

They boast about having achieved godhood, while they despise humans and see them as stupid and worthless. Their base of operations is the {{Nihongo|Vylock|\u30d0\u30a4\u30ed\u30c3\u30af|Bairokku}}, a brain-shaped castle capable of traversing dimensions and sending its forces to Earth due to its Dimensional Transfer Machine. After their leader got lost in the Reverse Dimension, its four leading members compete in a game to defeat the Jetmen with the prize being full-leadership. Tran eventually becomes powerful enough to assume command, but is deposed by Radiguet, who leads Vyram up to its destruction.\n\n====Radiguet====\n{{Nihongo|Radiguet|\u30e9\u30c7\u30a3\u30b2|Radige}}: A cold-hearted officer who is the nearest presence to a leader of the Vyram, refusing to acknowledge anyone above and will do anything to accomplish his goals including being the one who kills the Jetmen. In battle, Radiguet wields the {{Nihongo|Demon Sword Bloody Gate|\u9b54\u5263\u30d6\u30e9\u30c7\u30a3\u30b2\u30fc\u30c8|Maken Buradi G\u0113to}} and can transform into his true form when enraged. When Juuza returned to power, Radiguet attempts to kill her and ends being punished for his treachery by living as a human with no memory of his life in Vyram. Cared for by Saki, a girl on the verge of death, Radiguet unconsciously saves her life with his power. But though he wanted nothing to do with his past, Radiguet eventually regains his memories and helps the Jetmen in fighting Juuza. After killing Juuza to acquire Semimaru, Radiguet kills Saki to discard his humanity before nurturing Semimaru to assume its adult form though it was destroyed by the Great Icarus. Radiguet later attempt to bring the Demons under his control, managing to succeed with Ramon when he absorbed Gorg. When Tranza takes over the Vyram throne, Radiguet attempts to kill him, only to be made an example of by the stronger opponent and forced into humbling himself before Tranza. Baring a terrible grudge against Tranza since then, Radiguet allied himself with Maria and Grey to summon the meteor used to create Meteor BEM to take out the Jetmen, enraged to find Tranza used his plan as a springboard from his own scheme. Attempting to sabotage Veronica, Radiguet is hooked up to have his life force sucked out. However, instead of having the life sucked out of him, Radiguet drains Veronica's power. Later, after using the Jetmen to do his dirty work, Radiquet tortures Tranza before breaking his mind and leaving him powerless, becoming Vyram's leader. Ultimately, the side effects of his power boost manifest in his newly gained giant form, the armored {{Nihongo|Raguem|\u30e9\u30b2\u30e0|Ragemu}} (48, 50 & 51). After killing Rie so Red Hawk could not have her, Radiguet battles him until the other Jetmen arrive. After the five Jetmen defeat him, Radiguet assumes his Raguem form which not even the Great Icarus is a match for until the Tetraboy punches the weak point Rie made. To counter their advantage over him, Raguem assimilates the Vylock into armor that he uses to overpower Tetraboy. The Great Icarus separates and Ryuu uses the Jet Garuda to rip the armor off and the others destroy both the Jet Garuda and Raguem. Radiguet says that his soul will continue to curse the Jetmen for eternity from the Reverse Dimension before he explodes.\n\nRadiguet is portrayed by {{Nihongo|Masaki Tachi|\u8218\u6b63\u8cb4Tachi Masaki|}} (credited as  {{Nihongo|Daisuke Tachi|\u8218 \u5927\u4ecb|Tachi Daisuke}}). {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n====Tran====\n{{Nihongo|Tran|\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3|Toran}} (1-36) / {{Nihongo|Tranza|\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b6|Toranza}} (36-47): A [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] child who suggested a game to settle who would be Vyram's new leader. He specialized into creating toy-ish monsters to satisfy his fun desires, and thought both enemy or ally fatalities as \"just part of the fun\". Being the youngest of the Vyram was a big complex to him until his failed attempt to take out the Jetmen during their retreat to the Yamada Ranch was the last straw. The constant anger became unbearable to the point of Tran using it to accelerate his growth. With his new-found power and maturity, Tranza easily defeats both his comrades and the Jetmen for underestimating him before seizing leadership of Vyram. In addition to his psychokinetic powers from his gauntlet, and new-found arrogant nature, he can now assume disguises and wields the {{Nihongo|Boltranza|\u30dc\u30eb\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b6|Borutoranza}} blade. After his giant robot Veronica was ruined by Radiguet, and after completing his new Bio Gun, Tranza heads out to hunt both him and the Jetmen down. Fighting the entire Jetman team on his own, Tranza uses his Bio Gun to turn each Jetman member into a rock plate until only Ryuu remained. However, with Radiguet aiding Red Hawk before betraying him, the Bio Gun is destroyed by Red Hawk's charged Bringer Sword and the others are freed with the destruction of Tranza's gauntlet as they use the Fire Bazooka on Tranza. Though he survives the attacks, Radiguet tortures Tranza before sparring him to live with a severe brain injury at the Joutou Neurosurgery Hospital.\n\nTran is portrayed by {{Nihongo|Miku Kuga|\u4e45\u6211 \u672a\u6765|Kuga Miku}}.

Though originally to be a Jetman, Vyram's attack on the Earth Ship resulted with Rie being sucked into space. However, Rie is saved by Radiguet, who brainwashed her to be devoid of her memories as a human and made an official of Vyram. However, though he loved her and tells her that she is his, Maria defies Radiguet to suit her own agenda to be leader of Vyram. She loves to battle, and her methods are cruel and cold. She is armed with the Necrod, which has sword, gun, and whip modes. The monsters created by her were often motivated by envy, and attacked mainly women. Since the Camera Dimension incident, unconsciously playing the piano, Maria develops a relationship with Grey. Since then, she played piano music for Grey despite not knowing why, until her identity was found out and the relationship got difficult. Grey was willing to let her go if it made her happy. During the Demons incident, Maria momentarily reverted to Rie until Radiguet forced her back to her Vyram persona with a vendetta against Red Hawk. Eventually forfeiting their contest, Maria accepts Radiguet's proposal of ruling by his side in return of becoming even stronger than she is now. As a result, Maria is infected by a cell born from Radiguet's blood that turns her into a vampiric beast as she targets men, though unaware that she would transform into mindless puppet overtime. While fighting Ryuu, Maria assumes her monstrous form as she battles Red Hawk before assuming Rie's appearance to catch him off guard as the cell transfers itself to Ryuu in order to have him take out the Jetmen. While Ryuu manages to return to normal, Maria is in the final stage of her transformation as she defeats the other Jetmen before Ryuu arrives and manages to reach Rie, causing Maria to remember her true self as she reverts to her true form. When Radiguet comes to reclaim her, Rie pretends that she will go with him, only to stab him in the back before he mortally wounds her.

After detaching himself from his egg sack, this Dimensional Bug is sent to attack the Jetman, only to be destroyed by all five.\n* {{Nihongo|Demon Beast Semimaru|\u9b54\u7363\u30bb\u30df\u30de\u30eb|Maj\u016b Semimaru?}} (18-24): The demon king of destruction; an insectoid who is legendary for his destructive power. Juuza acquired such a monster and brought it to Earth while as an egg, feeding him enough human suffering to mature. Though she succeeds in her plan, Juuza is killed by Radiguet who raises Semimaru from his  green larval form to a red armored human-sized form. Once he emerges, the matured Semimaru enlarges himself as it goes on a rampage across the city while defeating Jet Icarus until the Bird Garuda intervenes and freezes the monster. However, once the monster breaks out of the Diamond Blizzard, he defeats Jet Garuda before leaving to tend to his wounds until Semimaru meets his end fighting the newly formed Great Icarus.\n* {{Nihongo|Demon Mu|\u9b54\u795e\u30e0\u30fc|Majin M\u016b?}} (30): A servant of Ramon and Gorg, Mu was put to sleep along with his two masters since ancient times. Accidentally released from his urn by two lost travelers, Mu goes to find an ideal warrior to use in a blood sacrifice to free his masters. Arriving to the scene of the Jetmen's fight with Radigam, Mu attacks them to pick out a suitable sacrifice and abducts Kaori to begin the ritual. Gai attempts to save Kaori and offers his blood in her place. Then, the other Jetmen intervene and battle Mu as they use the Fire Bazooka on him which he endured while Radiguet offers his blood to complete the demons' revival. Finding his masters revived, Mu was killed by Gorg for getting wounded.\n* {{Nihongo|Demon Ramon|\u9b54\u795e\u30e9\u30e2\u30f3|Majin Ramon?}} and {{Nihongo|Demon Gorg|\u9b54\u795e\u30b4\u30fc\u30b0|Majin G\u014dgu?}} (30-32): The natural predators of humanity, who turn humans into human fruits for consumption. Sealed during ancient times, they could only be released by the blood of a warrior, with Radiguet giving them his in return for their loyalty. However, the two claim they have no interest in eliminating humanity and see Radiguet as their enemy before they start to feed until the Jetmen intervene. Enlarging, Gorg battles Jet Icarus and Jet Garuda until the Tetraboy arrives and defeats the demon. With Gorg mortally wounded by Jet Icarus with the Tetra Buster, Ramon attempts to absorb him before Radiguet and Grey spirit away the dying Gorg and feed him Bio-Dimensional Bugs before Ramon finds him where he previously lay, succeeding in gaining control of the fused demon deity. Yet even with Gorg's power fusing with his own, Ramon is defeated by the Jetmen and then destroyed by the Hyper-Haken.\n* {{Nihongo|Hell Medusa|\u30b8\u30b4\u30af\u30e1\u30c9\u30a5\u30fc\u30b5|Jigokumed\u016bsa?}} (34): An internal defense mechanism designed to hunt down any intruders, it attacks Ryuu when he infiltrates the Vylock. Enlarging to stop Great Icarus from destroying Vyram's dimension transport device, Grey commands it to drain the giant robot's energy completely to explode with the Jetmen until Tetraboy intervenes and holds the monster long enough for Great Icarus to destroy Hell Medusa.\n* {{Nihongo|G2|J\u012bts\u016b?}} (42): A yellow robot created by Tranza as a trial platform for technologies meant for his Veronica project, G2 malfunctioned after serving its purpose and was relegated to being a training target for the Grinam soldiers while its onboard [[artificial intelligence|AI]] developed a childlike mind. Escaping to Earth, G2 finds itself in the middle of Grey and Maria's hunt for Gai and Kaori. After being given a replacement power source by Grey, G2 attempts to win his love by bringing Maria, who was in Red Hawk's custody at the time, to him. Unfortunately, the process is plagued with freak accidents as well as continued combat between Gray and the Jetmen, leaving G2 fatally-damaged while protecting Maria and Grey. Laying abandoned and unrecognized, G2 plays Maria's tune before self-destructing.\n* {{Nihongo|Veronica|\u30d9\u30ed\u30cb\u30ab|Beronika?}} (44-45): The ultimate giant robot built by Tranza, it required human life energy as a power source. Upon appearing on Earth, piloted by Tranza and the other Vyram officers, Veronica wreaks havoc on the city as it defeats Jet Icarus and Jet Garuda while stopping them from initiating Great Icarus, yet before Veronica could finish them off, it is damaged as a result of Radiguet's attempt to take the main controls from Tranza to deal the final blow. After Grey finishes repairs, Veronica resumes its attack as Tetraboy arrives to hold the robot off until the Great Icarus arrives. However, Veronica damages the giant robot after it reveals its power source with Tranza invading the robot. By the time Veronica returns, now powered by three of the Jetman, it overpowers Great Icarus until Radiguet's sabotage manifests. With Grey piloting Veronica as Tranza deals with Red Hawk after doing away with Radiguet, who completely drains Veronica's energy as the Jetmen fall back with the other captives to Great Icarus, which uses its Bird Maser to launch Tetraboy and destroy Veronica.\n* {{Nihongo|Great Tomato King|\u30c8\u30de\u30c8\u5927\u738b|Tomato Dai\u014d}} (46): The result of an outer dimensional entity called Metamol assuming the form of a nightmare from Raita's childhood when he was afraid of tomatoes, the Great Tomato King possesses the power to turn people into tomatoes based on Raita's innermost fear and enhancing it. Because it was created from Raita's fear, this monster overpowers the Jetmen as Tranza enlarges it. However, once Raita manages to overcome his childhood fear after seeing his sick plant grow one tomato, this monster loses his power as Raita eats his head via his tomatoes. This monster was destroyed by Jet Garuda.\n\n==Episodes==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" \n|- style=\"border-bottom: 3px solid Red;\"\n! style=\"width:1%;\"  | No.\n! Title\n! Director\n!

The novels were written specifically for adult fans of the TV series and included mature content, such as detailed descriptions of sexual intercourse between Ryuu and Rie, Gai and Kaori, and Radiguet and Maria. Empress J\u016bza, a one-off villain in the series, had an extended role while the Dimensional Beasts and giant robots were eliminated, with the Jetmen fighting humans subjected to the Vyram's experiments instead.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Toshiki|first1=Inoue|title=\u30b8\u30a7\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30f3: \u4ffa\u306b\u60da\u308c\u308d!, Volume 1|date=1992|publisher=[[Shogakukan]]|isbn=4094400311}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Toshiki|first1=Inoue|title=\u30b8\u30a7\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30f3: \u7206\u767a\u3059\u308b\u604b, Volume 2|date=1993|publisher=Shogakukan|isbn=409440032X}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Toshiki|first1=Inoue|title=\u30b8\u30a7\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30f3: \u4ffa\u306e\u80f8\u3067\u7720\u308c!, Volume 3|date=1995|publisher=Shogakukan|isbn=4094400338}}</ref>\n\n===Manga===\nA manga sequel to ''Jetman'' was published in 1996 authored by Akiko Fujii, in cooperation with the series' writing team (still under the [[Saburo Yatsude]] pen name). It was titled {{nihongo|''Ch\u014djin Sentai Jetman: Toki o Kakete''|\u9ce5\u4eba\u6226\u968a\u30b8\u30a7\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30f3 \u6642\u3092\u99c6\u3051\u3066||\"Time Flies\"}}. Set five years after the series (and, therefore, two years after the story ends), it shows the four remaining Jetmen rejoining to battle a revived Radiguet, who had possessed Tranza's broken body. Radiguet kidnaps Ryuu and Kaori's one-year-old daughter Aya Tendou and, much in the same way he turned Rie into Maria before, he accelerates her growth and brainwashes her into becoming Ruma, whom he considers a daughter. Meanwhile, Gai's empty spot in the team is filled by a young rock guitarist called {{nihongo|Jeffrey \"Jeff\" Kenzaki|\u30b8\u30a7\u30d5\u30ea\u30a3\u5263\u5d0e|Jefuryi Kenzaki}}, who is empowered by Birdonic Waves after a meteorite crashes next to him, and becomes {{nihongo|Green Eagle|\u30b0\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u30a4\u30fc\u30b0\u30eb|Gur\u012bn \u012aguru}} whose suit is Green instead of Black. In this manga series, the Jetmen uniform is slightly different, with the helmets more closely resembling those of ''Gatchaman'' (translucent, protruding visors, and uncovered faces).\n\n===Video game===\nA video game version of ''Ch\u014djin Sentai Jetman'' was released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] on December 21, 1991. The game was published by Angel (a subsidiary of Bandai) and developed by [[Natsume (company)|Natsume]]. It is a single-player side-scrolling action game where the player assumes role one of the Jetmen members as they fight against the forces of Vyram. The player can choose which Jetman they want to control at the start of each stage, each having their own weapon and maximum hit points:\n* Red Hawk and Black Condor: Bringer Sword, 8 hit points\n* Yellow Owl: Wing Gauntlet, 7 hit points\n* Blue Swallow and White Swan: Bird Blasters, 6 hit points\n\nThe initial five stages, Area A to Area E, can be played in any order, while the sixth and final stage, Area F, becomes available once the others have cleared. Each stage begins with a standard side-scrolling level in which the player fight their way to the end of the level in order to reach the stage's boss. Each Jetman has three types of attack: a weapon attack, a kick, and a special attack that destroys all enemies, but can only be used once (unless a replenishment is found). The boss segments consists of one-on-one battles between the team's giant robot, the Great Icarus, and a giant monster (all based on monsters from the show). The player has a four-level power gauge that will gradually fill up during the course of battle, which can be used to perform one of four possible special attacks.\n\nThe following is a list of bosses in the game and the stages where they appear:\n* Mirror Dimension (Area A)\n* Camera Dimension (Area B)\n* Bus Dimension (Area C)\n* Light Armadillo (Area D)\n* Dimensional Mammoth (Area E)\n* Destruction Beast Semimaru (Area F)\n\nThe game features four difficulty settings, a password option, and a Battle Mode where the player can fight against any of the first five bosses.\n\n==Cast==\n*{{Nihongo|Ryuu Tendou|\u5929\u5802 \u7adc|Tend\u014d Ry\u016b}}: {{Nihongo|[[K\u014dtar\u014d Tanaka (actor)|Koutaro Tanaka]]|\u7530\u4e2d \u5f18\u592a\u90ce|Tanaka Kotaro}}\n*{{Nihongo|Kaori Rokumeikan|\u9e7f\u9cf4\u9928 \u9999|Rokumeikan Kaori}}: {{Nihongo|Rika Kishida|\u5cb8\u7530 \u91cc\u4f73|Kishida Rika}}\n*{{Nihongo|Raita Oishi|\u5927\u77f3 \u96f7\u592a|\u014cishi Raita}}: {{nihongo|Ikko Tadano|\u305f\u3060\u306e \u3044\u3063\u3053|Tadano Ikko}} (Credited under {{Nihongo|Tomihisa Naruse|\u6210\u702c \u5bcc\u4e45|Naruse Tomihisa}})\n*{{Nihongo|Ako Hayasaka|\u65e9\u5742 \u30a2\u30b3|Hayasaka Ako}}: {{Nihongo|[[Sayuri Uchida]]|\u5185\u7530 \u3055\u3086\u308a|Uchida Sayuri}}\n*{{Nihongo|Gai Yuuki|\u7d50\u57ce \u51f1|Y\u016bki Gai}}: {{Nihongo|[[Toshihide Wakamatsu]]|\u82e5\u677e \u4fca\u79c0|Wakamatsu Toshihide}}\n*{{Nihongo|Commander Aya Odagiri|\u5c0f\u7530\u5207\u7dbe\u9577\u5b98|Odagiri Aya-ch\u014dkan}}: {{Nihongo|[[Mikiko Miki]]|\u4e09\u8f1d \u307f\u304d\u3053|Miki Mikiko}}\n*Jiiya: {{Nihongo|Yuuzo Hayakawa|\u65e9\u5ddd \u96c4\u4e09|Hayakawa Y\u016bz\u014d}}\n*{{Nihongo|Rie Aoi|\u85cd\u30ea\u30a8|Aoi Rie}}/{{Nihongo|Maria|\u30de\u30ea\u30a2|Maria}}: {{Nihongo|Maho Maruyama|\u4e38\u5c71 \u771f\u7a42 |Maho Maruyama}}\n*{{Nihongo|Radiguet|\u88cf\u6b21\u5143\u4f2f\u7235\u30e9\u30c7\u30a3\u30b2|Radige}}: {{Nihongo|Daisuke Tachi|\u8218 \u5927\u4ecb|Tachi Daisuke}}\n*{{Nihongo|Tran|\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3|Toran}}: {{Nihongo|Miku Kuga|\u4e45\u6211 \u672a\u6765|Kuga Miku}}\n*{{Nihongo|Emperor Tranza|\u5e1d\u738b\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b6|Tei\u014d Toranza}} : {{Nihongo|[[Yutaka Hirose]]|\u5e83\u702c \u88d5|Hirose Y\u016btaka}}\n*{{Nihongo|Grey|\u30b0\u30ec\u30a4|Gurei}}: {{Nihongo|Hideaki Kusaka|\u65e5\u4e0b \u79c0\u662d|Kusaka Hideaki|also Voice}}\n*Narrator: {{Nihongo|Tsutomu Tareki|\u5782\u6728 \u52c9|Tareki Tsutomu}}\n\n==Songs==\n;Opening theme\n*{{Nihongo|\"Ch\u014djin Sentai Jetman\"|\u9ce5\u4eba\u6226\u968a\u30b8\u30a7\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30f3|Ch\u014djin Sentai Jettoman}}\n**Lyrics: {{Nihongo|Toyohisa Araki|\u8352\u6728 \u3068\u3088\u3072\u3055|Araki Toyohisa}}\n**Composition and Arrangement: {{Nihongo|G\u014dji Tsuno|\u3064\u306e \u3054\u3046\u3058|Tsuno G\u014dji}}\n**Artist: [[Hironobu Kageyama]]\n\n;Ending theme\n*{{Nihongo|\"Your Heart is an Egg\"|\u3053\u3053\u308d\u306f\u30bf\u30de\u30b4|Kokoro wa Tamago}}\n**Lyrics: Toyohisa Araki\n**Composition: K\u014dji Tsuno\n**Arrangement: Kenji Yamamoto\n**Artist: Hironobu Kageyama\n\n==Reception==\nAs of 2015, the series has become one of the most popular and darkest entries in the [[Super Sentai]] Series.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} It officially gained a much wider audience and got a rating of 7.1% average, beating Fiveman's 6.5%.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Despite the series also receiving criticism for adding \"romance drama to a children's show\", Gai Yuuki became an instant hit with Japanese mothers, who sent clemency pleas to TV Asahi so that they did not kill him off.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} It is still today considered to Sentai fans a masterpiece and topped the number 1 popular vote in both Bandai's B-CLUB magazine and Toei's \"Super Sentai Request Tournament\".{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nIn the end, total revenue from the series greatly exceeded 15 billion yen.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nJetman was originally going to be adapted into the first season of ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]]'', but Saban chose its successor, ''[[Kyoryu Sentai Zyuranger]]'' to be the first instead.{{Original research inline|date=December 2017}}\n\n==Home media==\nIn 2018, [[Shout!

It is the fifteenth entry of the ''[[Super Sentai]]'' [[metaseries]], following the previous series ''[[Chikyu Sentai Fiveman]]''. The series aired on [[TV Asahi]] on February 15, 1991 to February 14, 1992, with a total of 51 episodes. It is the first Sentai series where the Blue and Yellow Rangers switch genders in the three male/two female team (the male wears yellow and the female wears blue), which would not occur again until ''[[Mahou Sentai Magiranger]]''. It is also the last Sentai series until ''[[Ressha Sentai ToQger]]'' to not get adapted into a ''[[Power Rangers]]'' series.\n\n[[Shout! Factory]] released ''Jetman'' in North America on September 25, 2018. This is the 10th ''Super Sentai'' to be released in North America and the only one that is non-Power Rangers adapted.\n\n==Plot==\nThis series takes place in 199X.{{refn|group=Note|name=second|The year is only addressed as \"199X\", but is later shown to be 1991, notably through Rie's tombstone.}} On the Earth Ship, the command center of a defence agency called Sky Force, the guardians of peace on Earth, scientists have developed \"Birdonic Waves\", a newly developed technology which gives the subject superhuman abilities. Experiments called \"J-Project\" were successful. Aya Odagiri, the director of the project, chooses five elite Sky Force officials from Earth to use this technology. Ryuu Tendou, one of the Sky Force officers, is successfully exposed to the Birdonic Waves, making him the first Jetman, the Red Hawk.\n\nHowever, the Earth Ship is suddenly attacked by Vyram, an evil outer-dimensional organization bent on inter-dimensional domination. They successfully destroy the ship, apparently killing Ryuu's lover and fellow candidate member Rie. In the chaos, the remaining Birdonic Waves for the other four officials become scattered on Earth, hitting four civilians. Odagiri and Tendou successfully escape and begin searching on Earth for the four remaining Jetmen, training them to aid them in stopping Vyram's plans of conquering their dimension.\n\nThe series later follows the tribulations of Ryuu as he learns of Rie's survival and enlistment in the Vyram forces, as well as a love triangle between Gai, Ryuu, and Kaori.\n\n==Production==\n''Ch\u014djin Sentai Jetman'' is the first Sentai series that paid homage to another show, ''[[Science Ninja Team Gatchaman]]''. Developed before the ending of ''[[Chikyuu Sentai Fiveman]]'', Toei chose [[Keita Amemiya]] to be the series' director. During its development, the series is once called {{nihongo|\"Ch\u014djin Sentai Birdman\"|\u8d85\u4eba\u6226\u968a\u30d0\u30fc\u30c9\u30de\u30f3|Ch\u014djin Sentai B\u0101doman|Lit.

One of them were Toshihide Wakamatsu who would go on to play Gai Yuuki/Black Condor. Before the series, the members were all referred to by their color but both Amemiya and Suzuki said that \"this [was] unnatural\" and decided the characters to refer each other by their names instead of their colors. Episodes without the characters transforming and fighting were also proposed, but seriously opposed by Bandai until the later half of the series.\n\nThe more mature themes such as drama, romantic love triangles and tragedy were in the series' after Takeyuki Suzuki watched ''[[Tosho Daimos]]'', and wanted to capture its \"high romance\". Both the comedy and dramatic tones influenced the series' overall popularity and had become its defining part.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Earth Defence Force Sky Force===\n{{Nihongo|Earth Defence Force Sky Force|\u5730\u7403\u9632\u885b\u8ecd\u30b9\u30ab\u30a4\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30b9|Chiky\u016b B\u014deigun Sukai F\u014dsu}} is the military organization the Jetmen belong to.\n\n====Jetmen====\nBased at the {{Nihongo|Sky Camp|\u30b9\u30ab\u30a4\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7|Sukai Kyanpu}}, a high-tech base provided by the Sky Force, the Jetman team is formed by five persons who gain superhuman strength through exposure to Birdonic Waves.

He is 25 years old at the beginning of the series, but turns 26 in episode 13. He is originally a Sky Force soldier codenamed \"W6\" and leader of the Jetmen. Being the only member of the Jetman team who is actually of military background, his policy is to be always professional and never let feelings affect himself in battle, and he expects the same from his teammates. This leads to a conflict when he discovers that his beloved Rie has become Maria, eventually coming to terms with the revelation as he resolves to save Rie from the Vyram control. However, Rie's death at the hands of his nemesis Radiguet proves to be the last straw, causing him to challenge Radiguet alone before Kaori consoles Ryuu and encourages him to stay true to his own belief in justice rather than revenge. Three years later, Ryuu marries Kaori and the two have a son, whom they name after their late teammate, Gai.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n*Attacks: {{Nihongo|Wing Punch|\u30a6\u30a4\u30f3\u30b0\u30d1\u30f3\u30c1|Uingu Panchi}}\n\nRyuu Tendou is portrayed by {{Nihongo|Kotaro Tanaka|\u7530\u4e2d \u5f18\u592a\u90ce|Tanaka Kotaro}}.\n\n=====Kaori Rokumeikan=====\n{{Nihongo|Kaori Rokumeikan|\u9e7f\u9cf4\u9928 \u9999|Rokumeikan Kaori}}/{{Nihongo|White Swan|\u30db\u30ef\u30a4\u30c8\u30b9\u30ef\u30f3|Howaito Suwan}}:  The 22-year-old heiress of the Rokumeikan Enterprises empire.

She is good at [[Kendo]] and is the best shot in Jetman. Kaori was in the middle of a love triangle with Ryuu and Gai, learning through hardships brought on by her new profession what a spoiled rich girl she was and what are truly important to herself. She was once engaged to a wealthy businessman named Soichiro Kitaoji and was close to marrying him, but she quickly ended their relationship when she saw his selfishness in contrast to her team's selfless determination as warriors of justice. She does sometimes use her wealth to help the team, like when she purchased a large amount of diamonds and other jewels to try and snap Ako out of the curse of the dimensional monster Diamond Dimension.

He initially clashes with the straight-laced Ryuu when drafted against his will but eventually comes to respect Ryuu's largely-principled disposition (Ryuu falters only over the issue of his lost girlfriend, something Gai, being a womanizer, can sympathize with), ultimately becoming friends with him. He loves Kaori and often tries to flirt with her, leading to much frustration due to his initially-unreciprocated feelings. When she finally accepts him, they frequently have problems in their relationship as they are too different. He later develops a rivalry with Vyram general Grey. He defeated Grey in their final encounter, in which a part of his helmet was damaged. Three years after the defeat of Vyram, while buying a bouquet for Ryuu and Kaori's wedding, Gai intervenes in a robbery and is stabbed in the stomach for the trouble.

She is good at martial arts, and the inventor of the team vehicles. She is both caring and stern to the Jetmen, and she is not above fighting alongside those under her charge and even personally covering their maneuvers if necessary. As befitting to her status as the Jetman team's commanding officer, her subordinates call her simply \"Commander\". She is also an able pilot, having flown Sky Force aircraft and even Jet Garuda on two occasions.\n\nCommander Aya Odagiri is portrayed by {{Nihongo|[[Mikiko Miki]]|\u4e09\u8f1d \u307f\u304d\u3053|Miki Mikiko}}.\n\n=====Supreme Commander Ichijou=====\n{{Nihongo|Supreme Commander Ichijou|\u4e00\u6761\u7dcf\u53f8\u4ee4|Ichij\u014d S\u014dshirei|40 & 41}} : A Sky Force officer who cares only for himself and bears a grudge against Commander Odagiri for being the commanding officer in the Jetmen project, which fell to civilians. With his Neo Jetmen, Ichijou gains appointment to assume command of Sky Camp base, bent on making Odagiri suffer while removing her Jetmen from the picture. However, he subsequently proves himself to be utterly incompetent in his new capacity when Bio-Dimension Beast Meteor BEM infiltrates and wreaks havoc within Sky Camp, being instantly demoralized at the first sign of Meteor BEM gaining the upper hand, refusing to even defend himself when offered the option to do so, and trapping his own Neo Jetmen team (and Commander Odagiri, who is attempting to aid the Neo Jetmen at the time) with the monster in a futile act of desperation. It is implied at the end of Episode 41 that Sky Force has since removed Ichijou from command and reinstated Odagiri in the aftermath of the attack.\n\n=====Neo Jetmen=====\n*{{Nihongo|Neo Jetmen|\u30cd\u30aa\u30b8\u30a7\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30f3|Neo Jettoman}} (40 & 41): J1 through J5, team created by Supreme Commander Ichijou to replace the Jetmen, having Birdonic Reactors implanted in bodies, bypassing the need for regular exposure to Birdonic Waves. J1 ([[Y\u016bta Mochizuki]], who later went on to play Geki/Tyranno Ranger in ''[[Ky\u014dry\u016b Sentai Zyuranger]]'') is armed with the Neo Sword, J2 is armed with the Neo Stinger scythe, and J4 is armed with the Neo Slicer boomerang. All five wield Neo Shooter guns and Neo Mine grenades, and their group attack is the Flare Buster twin cannon.

The group composed of {{Nihongo|Ray|\u30ec\u30a4|Rei}} (portrayed by Yasuhiro Ishiwata, who previously played Bun/Blue Flash from ''[[Choushinsei Flashman|Ch\u014dshinsei Flashman]]''), his lover {{Nihongo|Kanna|\u30ab\u30f3\u30ca|Kanna}} (portrayed by Kanako Maeda, formerly Momoko/Pink Mask in ''[[Hikari Sentai Maskman]]''), and the youthful {{Nihongo|Dan|\u30c0\u30f3|Dan}} (portrayed by Hideki Fujiwara, who would go on to play Dan/Tricera Ranger in ''[[Ky\u014dry\u016b Sentai Zyuranger]]''), they chased Vyram to Earth with the Bird Garuda. While Ray and Kanna working with the Jetmen in their fight against Semimaru, Dan becomes romantically interested at Ako when they meet, causing him to express his feelings in a comical fashion. After Ray and Kanna are killed by Radiguet when he hijacks Jet Garuda, Dan assumes his fighting form and is mortally wounded taking the robot back from Radiguet. He dies soon after Ako expresses her feelings about him.\n*{{Nihongo|Reverse Dimension Berserker Soldiers|\u88cf\u6b21\u5143\u30d9\u30eb\u30bb\u30eb\u30af\u306e\u6226\u58eb|Urajigen Beruseruku no Senshi}} (29): The two warriors from the Berserk region, destroyed by Vyram force under Radiguet whose people can change anything they hold into weapons, though they can give up that very power to save a life instead. Arriving to Earth, while {{Nihongo|Duran|\u30c7\u30e5\u30e9\u30f3|Dyuran}} is cared for by the Jetmen, {{Nihongo|Ru|\u30eb\u30fc|R\u016b}} attempts to kill Radiguet. However, after Ru realizes the error of her ways and Duran is saved from the control of the monster Armor Snake, the two leave Earth to find a world they can find peace in.\n\n==Enemies==\n===Dimensional War Party Vyram===\nThe {{Nihongo|Dimensional War Party Vyram|\u6b21\u5143\u6226\u56e3\u30d0\u30a4\u30e9\u30e0|Jigen Sendan Bairamu}} appears as a clan of outer-dimensional nobles, who conquered many worlds in the Reverse Dimension, and are now moving on to Front Dimension, ours. They boast about having achieved godhood, while they despise humans and see them as stupid and worthless. Their base of operations is the {{Nihongo|Vylock|\u30d0\u30a4\u30ed\u30c3\u30af|Bairokku}}, a brain-shaped castle capable of traversing dimensions and sending its forces to Earth due to its Dimensional Transfer Machine. After their leader got lost in the Reverse Dimension, its four leading members compete in a game to defeat the Jetmen with the prize being full-leadership. Tran eventually becomes powerful enough to assume command, but is deposed by Radiguet, who leads Vyram up to its destruction.\n\n====Radiguet====\n{{Nihongo|Radiguet|\u30e9\u30c7\u30a3\u30b2|Radige}}: A cold-hearted officer who is the nearest presence to a leader of the Vyram, refusing to acknowledge anyone above and will do anything to accomplish his goals including being the one who kills the Jetmen. In battle, Radiguet wields the {{Nihongo|Demon Sword Bloody Gate|\u9b54\u5263\u30d6\u30e9\u30c7\u30a3\u30b2\u30fc\u30c8|Maken Buradi G\u0113to}} and can transform into his true form when enraged. When Juuza returned to power, Radiguet attempts to kill her and ends being punished for his treachery by living as a human with no memory of his life in Vyram. Cared for by Saki, a girl on the verge of death, Radiguet unconsciously saves her life with his power. But though he wanted nothing to do with his past, Radiguet eventually regains his memories and helps the Jetmen in fighting Juuza. After killing Juuza to acquire Semimaru, Radiguet kills Saki to discard his humanity before nurturing Semimaru to assume its adult form though it was destroyed by the Great Icarus. Radiguet later attempt to bring the Demons under his control, managing to succeed with Ramon when he absorbed Gorg. When Tranza takes over the Vyram throne, Radiguet attempts to kill him, only to be made an example of by the stronger opponent and forced into humbling himself before Tranza. Baring a terrible grudge against Tranza since then, Radiguet allied himself with Maria and Grey to summon the meteor used to create Meteor BEM to take out the Jetmen, enraged to find Tranza used his plan as a springboard from his own scheme. Attempting to sabotage Veronica, Radiguet is hooked up to have his life force sucked out. However, instead of having the life sucked out of him, Radiguet drains Veronica's power. Later, after using the Jetmen to do his dirty work, Radiquet tortures Tranza before breaking his mind and leaving him powerless, becoming Vyram's leader. Ultimately, the side effects of his power boost manifest in his newly gained giant form, the armored {{Nihongo|Raguem|\u30e9\u30b2\u30e0|Ragemu}} (48, 50 & 51). After killing Rie so Red Hawk could not have her, Radiguet battles him until the other Jetmen arrive. After the five Jetmen defeat him, Radiguet assumes his Raguem form which not even the Great Icarus is a match for until the Tetraboy punches the weak point Rie made. To counter their advantage over him, Raguem assimilates the Vylock into armor that he uses to overpower Tetraboy. The Great Icarus separates and Ryuu uses the Jet Garuda to rip the armor off and the others destroy both the Jet Garuda and Raguem. Radiguet says that his soul will continue to curse the Jetmen for eternity from the Reverse Dimension before he explodes.\n\nRadiguet is portrayed by {{Nihongo|Masaki Tachi|\u8218\u6b63\u8cb4Tachi Masaki|}} (credited as  {{Nihongo|Daisuke Tachi|\u8218 \u5927\u4ecb|Tachi Daisuke}}). {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n====Tran====\n{{Nihongo|Tran|\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3|Toran}} (1-36) / {{Nihongo|Tranza|\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b6|Toranza}} (36-47): A [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] child who suggested a game to settle who would be Vyram's new leader. He specialized into creating toy-ish monsters to satisfy his fun desires, and thought both enemy or ally fatalities as \"just part of the fun\". Being the youngest of the Vyram was a big complex to him until his failed attempt to take out the Jetmen during their retreat to the Yamada Ranch was the last straw. The constant anger became unbearable to the point of Tran using it to accelerate his growth. With his new-found power and maturity, Tranza easily defeats both his comrades and the Jetmen for underestimating him before seizing leadership of Vyram. In addition to his psychokinetic powers from his gauntlet, and new-found arrogant nature, he can now assume disguises and wields the {{Nihongo|Boltranza|\u30dc\u30eb\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b6|Borutoranza}} blade. After his giant robot Veronica was ruined by Radiguet, and after completing his new Bio Gun, Tranza heads out to hunt both him and the Jetmen down. Fighting the entire Jetman team on his own, Tranza uses his Bio Gun to turn each Jetman member into a rock plate until only Ryuu remained. However, with Radiguet aiding Red Hawk before betraying him, the Bio Gun is destroyed by Red Hawk's charged Bringer Sword and the others are freed with the destruction of Tranza's gauntlet as they use the Fire Bazooka on Tranza. Though he survives the attacks, Radiguet tortures Tranza before sparring him to live with a severe brain injury at the Joutou Neurosurgery Hospital.\n\nTran is portrayed by {{Nihongo|Miku Kuga|\u4e45\u6211 \u672a\u6765|Kuga Miku}}. Tranza is portrayed by {{Nihongo|[[Yutaka Hirose]]|\u5e83\u702c \u88d5|Hirose Y\u016btaka}}.\n\n====Maria====\n{{Nihongo|Maria|\u30de\u30ea\u30a2|Maria}} (1-49): She was formerly known as {{Nihongo|Rie Aoi|\u85cd\u30ea\u30a8|Aoi Rie}}, ranked Sky Forcer W3, a love interest of Ryuu's who plays the piano. Though originally to be a Jetman, Vyram's attack on the Earth Ship resulted with Rie being sucked into space. However, Rie is saved by Radiguet, who brainwashed her to be devoid of her memories as a human and made an official of Vyram. However, though he loved her and tells her that she is his, Maria defies Radiguet to suit her own agenda to be leader of Vyram. She loves to battle, and her methods are cruel and cold. She is armed with the Necrod, which has sword, gun, and whip modes. The monsters created by her were often motivated by envy, and attacked mainly women. Since the Camera Dimension incident, unconsciously playing the piano, Maria develops a relationship with Grey. Since then, she played piano music for Grey despite not knowing why, until her identity was found out and the relationship got difficult. Grey was willing to let her go if it made her happy. During the Demons incident, Maria momentarily reverted to Rie until Radiguet forced her back to her Vyram persona with a vendetta against Red Hawk. Eventually forfeiting their contest, Maria accepts Radiguet's proposal of ruling by his side in return of becoming even stronger than she is now. As a result, Maria is infected by a cell born from Radiguet's blood that turns her into a vampiric beast as she targets men, though unaware that she would transform into mindless puppet overtime. While fighting Ryuu, Maria assumes her monstrous form as she battles Red Hawk before assuming Rie's appearance to catch him off guard as the cell transfers itself to Ryuu in order to have him take out the Jetmen. While Ryuu manages to return to normal, Maria is in the final stage of her transformation as she defeats the other Jetmen before Ryuu arrives and manages to reach Rie, causing Maria to remember her true self as she reverts to her true form. When Radiguet comes to reclaim her, Rie pretends that she will go with him, only to stab him in the back before he mortally wounds her. Before her death, Rie asks Ryuu to leave her out of it before being spirited away by Grey. Her ghost later appeared in the finale, saying farewell to Ryuu after his marriage to Kaori.\n\nMaria is portrayed by {{Nihongo|Maho Maruyama|\u4e38\u5c71 \u771f\u7a42 |Maho Maruyama}}.\n\n====Grey====\n{{Nihongo|Grey|\u30b0\u30ec\u30a4|Gurei}} (1-50): A robot who ironically was always the most reasoning member of the Vyram.

Despite being a robot, he showed human feelings, especially love for wine, music, cigars, and particularly Maria, learning to play the piano from example. As a result, Grey supports Maria in shielding her when fighting Jetman, seeing Gai Yuuki as an ideal rival. Learning of Radiguet's plan for her, Grey attempts to talk Maria out of it to no avail. This forces Grey to ask the Jetmen to save Maria. However, he instead takes her dying body away as he takes her death hard. With nothing to live for other than his code as a soldier, Grey calls the Jetmen out in a final match, with Gai wanting to fight him alone. Eventually, Grey is mortally damaged as Gai lit one last cigar for him as a sign of acknowledgment as a worthy rival before Grey shuts down.\n\nGrey is portrayed by {{Nihongo|Hideaki Kusaka|\u65e5\u4e0b \u79c0\u662d|Kusaka Hideaki}}.\n\n====Empress Juuza====\n{{Nihongo|Empress Juuza|\u5973\u5e1d\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30b6|Jotei J\u016bza|17 & 18}}: The true leader of Vyram, referring to herself as mother of all creation, Juuza along her underlings Radiguet, Grey, and Tran had conquered many dimensions.

Thought to be killed during the Reverse Dimension Invasion War, she actually went under a long sleep after acquiring the Semimaru and incubating it, and came to Earth via a meteorite. She makes her presence known by causing a momentary blackout across the city. By the time the Jetmen investigate, finding Radiguet as he was about to kill her while asleep, Juuza emerges and resumes control of Vyram. She then proceeds to use the humans' pain and suffering from crystals sprouting from their bodies before becoming crystals themselves to feed Semimaru. The Jetmen nearly lose to her as Gai is affected by Juuza's crystal beam while shielding Kaori from it. After punishing Radiguet to live as a human for his treachery, Juuza resumes her attack as the Jetmen battle her before Gai succumbs to Juuza's spell and dies. With some unexpected assistance from Radiguet, White Swan destroys her forehead crystal after asking for Gai's strength in order to revive everyone she turned into crystals. Enraged that her face is hurt, Juuza assumes her Demon Beast Juuza form as the rest of Vyram and Black Condor join the fight against her as the Jetmen use the Fire Bazooka to defeat her. Near death, she is killed by Radiguet when he throws his sword into her throat just before Semimaru hatched.\n\n====Grinam soldiers====\n{{Nihongo|Grinam soldiers|\u30b0\u30ea\u30ca\u30e0\u5175|Gurinamu Hei}}: The black-skinned grunts born from Grinam seeds. They are armed with axes and capable of launching explosive shells from their hands.

Empress J\u016bza, a one-off villain in the series, had an extended role while the Dimensional Beasts and giant robots were eliminated, with the Jetmen fighting humans subjected to the Vyram's experiments instead.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Toshiki|first1=Inoue|title=\u30b8\u30a7\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30f3: \u4ffa\u306b\u60da\u308c\u308d!, Volume 1|date=1992|publisher=[[Shogakukan]]|isbn=4094400311}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Toshiki|first1=Inoue|title=\u30b8\u30a7\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30f3: \u7206\u767a\u3059\u308b\u604b, Volume 2|date=1993|publisher=Shogakukan|isbn=409440032X}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Toshiki|first1=Inoue|title=\u30b8\u30a7\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30f3: \u4ffa\u306e\u80f8\u3067\u7720\u308c!, Volume 3|date=1995|publisher=Shogakukan|isbn=4094400338}}</ref>\n\n===Manga===\nA manga sequel to ''Jetman'' was published in 1996 authored by Akiko Fujii, in cooperation with the series' writing team (still under the [[Saburo Yatsude]] pen name). It was titled {{nihongo|''Ch\u014djin Sentai Jetman: Toki o Kakete''|\u9ce5\u4eba\u6226\u968a\u30b8\u30a7\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30f3 \u6642\u3092\u99c6\u3051\u3066||\"Time Flies\"}}. Set five years after the series (and, therefore, two years after the story ends), it shows the four remaining Jetmen rejoining to battle a revived Radiguet, who had possessed Tranza's broken body. Radiguet kidnaps Ryuu and Kaori's one-year-old daughter Aya Tendou and, much in the same way he turned Rie into Maria before, he accelerates her growth and brainwashes her into becoming Ruma, whom he considers a daughter. Meanwhile, Gai's empty spot in the team is filled by a young rock guitarist called {{nihongo|Jeffrey \"Jeff\" Kenzaki|\u30b8\u30a7\u30d5\u30ea\u30a3\u5263\u5d0e|Jefuryi Kenzaki}}, who is empowered by Birdonic Waves after a meteorite crashes next to him, and becomes {{nihongo|Green Eagle|\u30b0\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u30a4\u30fc\u30b0\u30eb|Gur\u012bn \u012aguru}} whose suit is Green instead of Black. In this manga series, the Jetmen uniform is slightly different, with the helmets more closely resembling those of ''Gatchaman'' (translucent, protruding visors, and uncovered faces).\n\n===Video game===\nA video game version of ''Ch\u014djin Sentai Jetman'' was released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] on December 21, 1991. The game was published by Angel (a subsidiary of Bandai) and developed by [[Natsume (company)|Natsume]]. It is a single-player side-scrolling action game where the player assumes role one of the Jetmen members as they fight against the forces of Vyram. The player can choose which Jetman they want to control at the start of each stage, each having their own weapon and maximum hit points:\n* Red Hawk and Black Condor: Bringer Sword, 8 hit points\n* Yellow Owl: Wing Gauntlet, 7 hit points\n* Blue Swallow and White Swan: Bird Blasters, 6 hit points\n\nThe initial five stages, Area A to Area E, can be played in any order, while the sixth and final stage, Area F, becomes available once the others have cleared. Each stage begins with a standard side-scrolling level in which the player fight their way to the end of the level in order to reach the stage's boss. Each Jetman has three types of attack: a weapon attack, a kick, and a special attack that destroys all enemies, but can only be used once (unless a replenishment is found). The boss segments consists of one-on-one battles between the team's giant robot, the Great Icarus, and a giant monster (all based on monsters from the show). The player has a four-level power gauge that will gradually fill up during the course of battle, which can be used to perform one of four possible special attacks.\n\nThe following is a list of bosses in the game and the stages where they appear:\n* Mirror Dimension (Area A)\n* Camera Dimension (Area B)\n* Bus Dimension (Area C)\n* Light Armadillo (Area D)\n* Dimensional Mammoth (Area E)\n* Destruction Beast Semimaru (Area F)\n\nThe game features four difficulty settings, a password option, and a Battle Mode where the player can fight against any of the first five bosses.\n\n==Cast==\n*{{Nihongo|Ryuu Tendou|\u5929\u5802 \u7adc|Tend\u014d Ry\u016b}}: {{Nihongo|[[K\u014dtar\u014d Tanaka (actor)|Koutaro Tanaka]]|\u7530\u4e2d \u5f18\u592a\u90ce|Tanaka Kotaro}}\n*{{Nihongo|Kaori Rokumeikan|\u9e7f\u9cf4\u9928 \u9999|Rokumeikan Kaori}}: {{Nihongo|Rika Kishida|\u5cb8\u7530 \u91cc\u4f73|Kishida Rika}}\n*{{Nihongo|Raita Oishi|\u5927\u77f3 \u96f7\u592a|\u014cishi Raita}}: {{nihongo|Ikko Tadano|\u305f\u3060\u306e \u3044\u3063\u3053|Tadano Ikko}} (Credited under {{Nihongo|Tomihisa Naruse|\u6210\u702c \u5bcc\u4e45|Naruse Tomihisa}})\n*{{Nihongo|Ako Hayasaka|\u65e9\u5742 \u30a2\u30b3|Hayasaka Ako}}: {{Nihongo|[[Sayuri Uchida]]|\u5185\u7530 \u3055\u3086\u308a|Uchida Sayuri}}\n*{{Nihongo|Gai Yuuki|\u7d50\u57ce \u51f1|Y\u016bki Gai}}: {{Nihongo|[[Toshihide Wakamatsu]]|\u82e5\u677e \u4fca\u79c0|Wakamatsu Toshihide}}\n*{{Nihongo|Commander Aya Odagiri|\u5c0f\u7530\u5207\u7dbe\u9577\u5b98|Odagiri Aya-ch\u014dkan}}: {{Nihongo|[[Mikiko Miki]]|\u4e09\u8f1d \u307f\u304d\u3053|Miki Mikiko}}\n*Jiiya: {{Nihongo|Yuuzo Hayakawa|\u65e9\u5ddd \u96c4\u4e09|Hayakawa Y\u016bz\u014d}}\n*{{Nihongo|Rie Aoi|\u85cd\u30ea\u30a8|Aoi Rie}}/{{Nihongo|Maria|\u30de\u30ea\u30a2|Maria}}: {{Nihongo|Maho Maruyama|\u4e38\u5c71 \u771f\u7a42 |Maho Maruyama}}\n*{{Nihongo|Radiguet|\u88cf\u6b21\u5143\u4f2f\u7235\u30e9\u30c7\u30a3\u30b2|Radige}}: {{Nihongo|Daisuke Tachi|\u8218 \u5927\u4ecb|Tachi Daisuke}}\n*{{Nihongo|Tran|\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3|Toran}}: {{Nihongo|Miku Kuga|\u4e45\u6211 \u672a\u6765|Kuga Miku}}\n*{{Nihongo|Emperor Tranza|\u5e1d\u738b\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b6|Tei\u014d Toranza}} : {{Nihongo|[[Yutaka Hirose]]|\u5e83\u702c \u88d5|Hirose Y\u016btaka}}\n*{{Nihongo|Grey|\u30b0\u30ec\u30a4|Gurei}}: {{Nihongo|Hideaki Kusaka|\u65e5\u4e0b \u79c0\u662d|Kusaka Hideaki|also Voice}}\n*Narrator: {{Nihongo|Tsutomu Tareki|\u5782\u6728 \u52c9|Tareki Tsutomu}}\n\n==Songs==\n;Opening theme\n*{{Nihongo|\"Ch\u014djin Sentai Jetman\"|\u9ce5\u4eba\u6226\u968a\u30b8\u30a7\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30f3|Ch\u014djin Sentai Jettoman}}\n**Lyrics: {{Nihongo|Toyohisa Araki|\u8352\u6728 \u3068\u3088\u3072\u3055|Araki Toyohisa}}\n**Composition and Arrangement: {{Nihongo|G\u014dji Tsuno|\u3064\u306e \u3054\u3046\u3058|Tsuno G\u014dji}}\n**Artist: [[Hironobu Kageyama]]\n\n;Ending theme\n*{{Nihongo|\"Your Heart is an Egg\"|\u3053\u3053\u308d\u306f\u30bf\u30de\u30b4|Kokoro wa Tamago}}\n**Lyrics: Toyohisa Araki\n**Composition: K\u014dji Tsuno\n**Arrangement: Kenji Yamamoto\n**Artist: Hironobu Kageyama\n\n==Reception==\nAs of 2015, the series has become one of the most popular and darkest entries in the [[Super Sentai]] Series.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} It officially gained a much wider audience and got a rating of 7.1% average, beating Fiveman's 6.5%.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Despite the series also receiving criticism for adding \"romance drama to a children's show\", Gai Yuuki became an instant hit with Japanese mothers, who sent clemency pleas to TV Asahi so that they did not kill him off.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} It is still today considered to Sentai fans a masterpiece and topped the number 1 popular vote in both Bandai's B-CLUB magazine and Toei's \"Super Sentai Request Tournament\".{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nIn the end, total revenue from the series greatly exceeded 15 billion yen.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nJetman was originally going to be adapted into the first season of ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]]'', but Saban chose its successor, ''[[Kyoryu Sentai Zyuranger]]'' to be the first instead.{{Original research inline|date=December 2017}}\n\n==Home media==\nIn 2018, [[Shout!

{"title_page": "Shipping container architecture", "text_new": "{{short description|Buildings constructed using modules, like shipping containers}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{Tone|date=August 2015}}\n{{prose|date=January 2017}}\n}}\n[[File:Oldenburg provisorische Bankfiliale.jpg|thumb|300px|A temporary bank branch built from shipping containers in Germany]]\n'''Shipping container architecture''' is a form of [[architecture]] using [[steel]] [[intermodal container]]s ([[shipping container]]s) as structural element. It is also referred to as '''cargotecture''', a [[portmanteau]] of [[cargo]] with architecture, or \"'''arkitainer'''\".\n\nThe use of containers as a building material has grown in popularity over the past several years due to their inherent strength, wide availability, and relatively low expense. Homes have also been built with containers because they are seen{{By whom|date=October 2018}} as more eco-friendly than traditional building materials such as brick and cement.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n==Advantages==\n;Customized\n:Due to their shape and material, shipping containers can be easily modified to fit many purposes.\n \n;Strength and durability\n:Shipping containers are designed to be stacked in high columns, carrying heavy loads. They are also designed to resist harsh environments, such as on ocean-going vessels or sprayed with [[Sodium chloride#Road salt|road salt]] while transported on roads. Due to their high strength, shipping containers are usually the last to fall in extreme weather, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, and tsunamis.\n\n;Modular\n:All shipping containers are the same width and most have two standard height and length measurements and as such they provide modular elements that can be combined into larger structures. This simplifies design, planning and transport. As they are already designed to interlock for ease of mobility during transportation, structural construction is completed by simply emplacing them. Due to the containers' modular design, additional construction is as easy as stacking more containers. They can be stacked up to 12 units high when empty.\n\n;Labor\n:The [[welding]] and cutting of steel is considered to be specialized labor and can increase construction expenses, yet overall it is still lower than conventional construction.  Unlike wood frame construction, attachments must be welded or drilled to the outer skin, which is more time consuming and requires different job site equipment.\n\n;Transport\n:Because they already conform to standard shipping sizes, pre-fabricated modules can be easily transported by ship, truck, or rail.\n\n;Availability\n:Because of their wide-spread use, new and used shipping containers are available across the planet.\n\n;Expense\n:Many used containers are available at an amount that is low compared to a finished structure built by other labor-intensive means such as bricks and mortar \u2014 which also require larger more expensive foundations.{{Citation needed|reason=|date=September 2017}}<!--Do not use commercial sites for sources, as this is considered spam.-->\n\n;Eco-friendly\n:A 40 ft shipping container weights over 3,500 kg. When [[upcycling]] shipping containers, thousands of kilograms of steel are saved. In addition when building with containers, the amount of traditional building materials needed (i.e. bricks and cement) are reduced.\n\n==Disadvantages==\n;Temperature\n:Steel conducts heat very well; containers used for human occupancy in an environment with extreme temperature variations will normally have to be better insulated than most brick, block or wood structures.\n\n;Lack of flexibility\n:Although shipping containers can be combined together to create bigger spaces, creating spaces different to their default size (either 20 or 40 foot) is expensive and time consuming. Containers any longer than 40 feet will be difficult to navigate in some residential areas.\n\n;Humidity\n:As noted above, single wall steel conducts heat.  In temperate climates, moist interior air condenses against the steel, becoming clammy.  Rust will form unless the steel is well sealed and insulated.\n\n;Construction site\n:The size and weight of the containers will, in most cases, require them to be placed by a crane or forklift. Traditional brick, block and lumber construction materials can often be moved by hand, even to upper stories.\n\n;Building permits\n:The use of [[steel]] for construction, while prevalent in industrial construction, is not widely used for residential structures. Obtaining building permits may be troublesome in some regions due to municipalities not having seen this application before. However, in the US certain shipping container homes have been built in outside of the city's zoning code; this meant no building permits were required.\n\n;Treatment of timber floors\n:To meet Australian government quarantine requirements, most container floors when manufactured are treated with insecticides containing copper (23\u201325%), chromium (38\u201345%) and arsenic (30\u201337%). Before human habitation, floors should be removed and safely disposed. Units with steel floors would be preferable, if available.\n\n;Cargo spillages\n:A container can carry a wide variety of cargo during its working life. Spillages or contamination may have occurred on the inside surfaces and will have to be cleaned before habitation. Ideally all internal surfaces should be [[abrasive blasting|abrasive blasted]] to bare metal, and re-painted with a nontoxic paint system.\n\n;Solvents\n:Solvents released from paint and sealants used in manufacture might be harmful.\n\n;Damage\n:While in service, containers are damaged by friction, handling collisions, and force of heavy loads overhead during ship transits.  The companies will inspect containers and condemn them if there are cracked welds, twisted frames or pin holes are found, among other faults.\n\n;Roof weaknesses\n:Although the two ends of a container are extremely strong, the roof is not. A limit of 300 kg is recommended.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n'''\n\n==Examples==\n[[File:Container Wall.jpg|thumb|right|Shipping containers stacked to form a semi-permanent wall at an iron ore mine in Western Australia]]\n\nMany structures based on shipping containers have already been constructed, and their uses, sizes, locations and appearances vary widely.\n\nWhen [[Futures studies|futurist]] [[Stewart Brand]] needed a place to assemble all the material he needed to write ''[[How Buildings Learn]]'', he converted a shipping container into office space, and wrote up the conversion process in the same book.\n\nIn 2006, Southern California Architect [[Peter DeMaria]], designed the first two-story shipping container home in the U.S. as an approved structural system under the strict guidelines of the nationally recognized Uniform Building Code (UBC). This home was the Redondo Beach House and it inspired the creation of Logical Homes, a cargo container based pre-fabricated home company. In 2007, Logical Homes created their flagship project - the Aegean, for the Computer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nSeveral [[architect]]s, such as Adam Kalkin have built original homes, using discarded shipping containers for their parts or using them in their original form, or doing a mix of both.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography: Adam Kalkin|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2007-02-16/tech/kalkin.biog_1_mass-housing-disaster-relief-adam-kalkin?_s=PM:TECH|publisher=[[CNN]]|author=Linnie Rawlinson|date=February 16, 2007|accessdate=2011-09-17}}{{dead link|date=November 2019}}</ref>\n[[File:Container City massing model.svg|thumb|left|300px|Illustration of the structure of Container City showing how the containers are stacked.]]\nIn 2000, the firm Urban Space Management completed the project called ''[[Container City|Container City I]]'' in the [[Trinity Buoy Wharf]] area of London.

The use of containers creates a cost-effective, modular, and customizable solution to on-site waste water treatment and eliminates the need for construction of a separate building to house the treatment system.\n\nBrian McCarthy, an MBA student, saw many poor neighborhoods in [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]], Mexico during an MBA field trip in the 2000s. Since then he developed prototypes of shipping container housing for typical [[maquiladora]] workers in Mexico.<ref>\"[http://www.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/wayoflife/09/24/container.homes.ap/index.html Shipping containers could be 'dream' homes for thousands].\" ''[[CNN]]''.

Developing the concept further, Auro Foxcroft conceived the idea to add London Underground Tube carriages as part of its recycled shipping container architecture. \n\nApplication for the Live Event & Entertainment Industry:\nin 2010 German Architect and Production Designer, [[Stefan Beese]], utilized six 40\u2019 long [[shipping containers]] to create a large viewing deck and a VIP lounge area for to substitute the typical grand stand [[scaffold]] structure at the [[Voodoo Music Experience]], New Orleans. The containers also smartly do double duty as storage space for other festival components throughout the year.\nThe two top containers are cantilevered nine feet on each side creating two balconies that are prime viewing locations. There are also two bars located on the balconies. Each container was perforated with cutouts spelling the word \"VOODOO,\" which not only brands the structure but creates different vantage points and service area openings.

[[Architect]]s as well as [[Layman|laypeople]] have used them to build many types of buildings such as homes,{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} offices, apartments, schools, dormitories, artists' studios and emergency shelters; they have also been used as swimming pools. They are also used to provide temporary secure spaces on construction sites and other venues on an \"as is\" basis instead of building shelters.\n\nPhillip C. Clark filed for a United States patent on November 23, 1987 described as \"Method for converting one or more steel shipping containers into a habitable building at a building site and the product thereof\".  This patent was granted August 8, 1989 as patent 4854094. The patent documentation shows what are possibly the earliest recorded plans for constructing shipping container housing and shelters by laying out some very basic architectural concepts. Regardless, the patent may not have represented novel invention at its time of filing. Paul Sawyers previously described extensive shipping container buildings used on the set of the 1985 film [[Space Rage|Space Rage Breakout on Prison Planet]].\n\nOther examples of earlier container architecture concepts also exist such as a 1977 report entitled 'Shipping Containers as Structural Systems' investigating the feasibility of using twenty foot shipping containers as structural elements by the US military.\n\nDuring the [[1991 Gulf War]], containers saw considerable nonstandard uses not only as makeshift shelters but also for the transportation of Iraqi [[prisoners of war]]. Holes were cut in the containers to allow for ventilation. Containers continue to be used for military shelters, often additionally fortified by adding sandbags to the side walls to protect against weapons such as rocket-propelled grenades (\"RPGs\").\n\nThe abundance and relative cheapness of these containers during the last decade comes from the deficit in manufactured goods coming from [[North America]] in the last two decades.  These manufactured goods come to North America from Asia and, to a lesser extent, Europe, in containers that often have to be shipped back empty, or \"deadhead\", at considerable expense. It is often cheaper to buy new containers in Asia than to ship old ones back. Therefore, new applications are sought for the used containers that have reached their North American destination.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Shipping container clinic]]\n* [[Containerization]]\n* [[Modular building]]\n* [[Prefabricated building]]\n* [[Alternative housing]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n; Books\n*Kotnik, Jure (2008).

It is also referred to as '''cargotecture''', a [[portmanteau]] of [[cargo]] with architecture, or \"'''arkitainer'''\".\n\nThe use of containers as a building material has grown in popularity over the past several years due to their inherent strength, wide availability, and relatively low expense. Homes have also been built with containers because they are seen{{By whom|date=October 2018}} as more eco-friendly than traditional building materials such as brick and cement.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n==Advantages==\n;Customized\n:Due to their shape and material, shipping containers can be easily modified to fit many purposes.\n \n;Strength and durability\n:Shipping containers are designed to be stacked in high columns, carrying heavy loads. They are also designed to resist harsh environments, such as on ocean-going vessels or sprayed with [[Sodium chloride#Road salt|road salt]] while transported on roads. Due to their high strength, shipping containers are usually the last to fall in extreme weather, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, and tsunamis.\n\n;Modular\n:All shipping containers are the same width and most have two standard height and length measurements and as such they provide modular elements that can be combined into larger structures. This simplifies design, planning and transport. As they are already designed to interlock for ease of mobility during transportation, structural construction is completed by simply emplacing them. Due to the containers' modular design, additional construction is as easy as stacking more containers. They can be stacked up to 12 units high when empty.\n\n;Labor\n:The [[welding]] and cutting of steel is considered to be specialized labor and can increase construction expenses, yet overall it is still lower than conventional construction.  Unlike wood frame construction, attachments must be welded or drilled to the outer skin, which is more time consuming and requires different job site equipment.\n\n;Transport\n:Because they already conform to standard shipping sizes, pre-fabricated modules can be easily transported by ship, truck, or rail.\n\n;Availability\n:Because of their wide-spread use, new and used shipping containers are available across the planet.\n\n;Expense\n:Many used containers are available at an amount that is low compared to a finished structure built by other labor-intensive means such as bricks and mortar \u2014 which also require larger more expensive foundations.{{Citation needed|reason=|date=September 2017}}<!--Do not use commercial sites for sources, as this is considered spam.-->\n\n;Eco-friendly\n:A 40 ft shipping container weights over 3,500 kg. When [[upcycling]] shipping containers, thousands of kilograms of steel are saved. In addition when building with containers, the amount of traditional building materials needed (i.e. bricks and cement) are reduced.\n\n==Disadvantages==\n;Temperature\n:Steel conducts heat very well; containers used for human occupancy in an environment with extreme temperature variations will normally have to be better insulated than most brick, block or wood structures.\n\n;Lack of flexibility\n:Although shipping containers can be combined together to create bigger spaces, creating spaces different to their default size (either 20 or 40 foot) is expensive and time consuming. Containers any longer than 40 feet will be difficult to navigate in some residential areas.\n\n;Humidity\n:As noted above, single wall steel conducts heat.  In temperate climates, moist interior air condenses against the steel, becoming clammy.  Rust will form unless the steel is well sealed and insulated.\n\n;Construction site\n:The size and weight of the containers will, in most cases, require them to be placed by a crane or forklift. Traditional brick, block and lumber construction materials can often be moved by hand, even to upper stories.\n\n;Building permits\n:The use of [[steel]] for construction, while prevalent in industrial construction, is not widely used for residential structures. Obtaining building permits may be troublesome in some regions due to municipalities not having seen this application before. However, in the US certain shipping container homes have been built in outside of the city's zoning code; this meant no building permits were required.\n\n;Treatment of timber floors\n:To meet Australian government quarantine requirements, most container floors when manufactured are treated with insecticides containing copper (23\u201325%), chromium (38\u201345%) and arsenic (30\u201337%). Before human habitation, floors should be removed and safely disposed. Units with steel floors would be preferable, if available.\n\n;Cargo spillages\n:A container can carry a wide variety of cargo during its working life. Spillages or contamination may have occurred on the inside surfaces and will have to be cleaned before habitation. Ideally all internal surfaces should be [[abrasive blasting|abrasive blasted]] to bare metal, and re-painted with a nontoxic paint system.\n\n;Solvents\n:Solvents released from paint and sealants used in manufacture might be harmful.\n\n;Damage\n:While in service, containers are damaged by friction, handling collisions, and force of heavy loads overhead during ship transits.  The companies will inspect containers and condemn them if there are cracked welds, twisted frames or pin holes are found, among other faults.\n\n;Roof weaknesses\n:Although the two ends of a container are extremely strong, the roof is not. A limit of 300 kg is recommended.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n'''\n\n==Examples==\n[[File:Container Wall.jpg|thumb|right|Shipping containers stacked to form a semi-permanent wall at an iron ore mine in Western Australia]]\n\nMany structures based on shipping containers have already been constructed, and their uses, sizes, locations and appearances vary widely.\n\nWhen [[Futures studies|futurist]] [[Stewart Brand]] needed a place to assemble all the material he needed to write ''[[How Buildings Learn]]'', he converted a shipping container into office space, and wrote up the conversion process in the same book.\n\nIn 2006, Southern California Architect [[Peter DeMaria]], designed the first two-story shipping container home in the U.S. as an approved structural system under the strict guidelines of the nationally recognized Uniform Building Code (UBC). This home was the Redondo Beach House and it inspired the creation of Logical Homes, a cargo container based pre-fabricated home company. In 2007, Logical Homes created their flagship project - the Aegean, for the Computer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nSeveral [[architect]]s, such as Adam Kalkin have built original homes, using discarded shipping containers for their parts or using them in their original form, or doing a mix of both.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography: Adam Kalkin|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2007-02-16/tech/kalkin.biog_1_mass-housing-disaster-relief-adam-kalkin?_s=PM:TECH|publisher=[[CNN]]|author=Linnie Rawlinson|date=February 16, 2007|accessdate=2011-09-17}}{{dead link|date=November 2019}}</ref>\n[[File:Container City massing model.svg|thumb|left|300px|Illustration of the structure of Container City showing how the containers are stacked.]]\nIn 2000, the firm Urban Space Management completed the project called ''[[Container City|Container City I]]'' in the [[Trinity Buoy Wharf]] area of London.  The firm has gone on to complete additional container-based building projects, with more underway. In 2006, the Dutch company Tempohousing finished in Amsterdam the biggest container village in the world: 1,000 student homes from modified shipping containers from China.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hotel changes the landscape of building|author=Robert Cookson|date=January 21, 2009|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b9aad44a-e7f1-11dd-b2a5-0000779fd2ac.html#axzz1YGQKwrxk|newspaper=[[Financial Times]]|accessdate=2011-09-17}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002 standard ISO shipping containers began to be modified and used as stand-alone [[Onsite sewage facility|on-site wastewater treatment]] plants. The use of containers creates a cost-effective, modular, and customizable solution to on-site waste water treatment and eliminates the need for construction of a separate building to house the treatment system.\n\nBrian McCarthy, an MBA student, saw many poor neighborhoods in [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]], Mexico during an MBA field trip in the 2000s. Since then he developed prototypes of shipping container housing for typical [[maquiladora]] workers in Mexico.<ref>\"[http://www.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/wayoflife/09/24/container.homes.ap/index.html Shipping containers could be 'dream' homes for thousands].\" ''[[CNN]]''.

Developing the concept further, Auro Foxcroft conceived the idea to add London Underground Tube carriages as part of its recycled shipping container architecture. \n\nApplication for the Live Event & Entertainment Industry:\nin 2010 German Architect and Production Designer, [[Stefan Beese]], utilized six 40\u2019 long [[shipping containers]] to create a large viewing deck and a VIP lounge area for to substitute the typical grand stand [[scaffold]] structure at the [[Voodoo Music Experience]], New Orleans. The containers also smartly do double duty as storage space for other festival components throughout the year.\nThe two top containers are cantilevered nine feet on each side creating two balconies that are prime viewing locations. There are also two bars located on the balconies. Each container was perforated with cutouts spelling the word \"VOODOO,\" which not only brands the structure but creates different vantage points and service area openings.

[[Architect]]s as well as [[Layman|laypeople]] have used them to build many types of buildings such as homes,{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} offices, apartments, schools, dormitories, artists' studios and emergency shelters; they have also been used as swimming pools. They are also used to provide temporary secure spaces on construction sites and other venues on an \"as is\" basis instead of building shelters.\n\nPhillip C. Clark filed for a United States patent on November 23, 1987 described as \"Method for converting one or more steel shipping containers into a habitable building at a building site and the product thereof\".  This patent was granted August 8, 1989 as patent 4854094. The patent documentation shows what are possibly the earliest recorded plans for constructing shipping container housing and shelters by laying out some very basic architectural concepts. Regardless, the patent may not have represented novel invention at its time of filing. Paul Sawyers previously described extensive shipping container buildings used on the set of the 1985 film [[Space Rage|Space Rage Breakout on Prison Planet]].\n\nOther examples of earlier container architecture concepts also exist such as a 1977 report entitled 'Shipping Containers as Structural Systems' investigating the feasibility of using twenty foot shipping containers as structural elements by the US military.\n\nDuring the [[1991 Gulf War]], containers saw considerable nonstandard uses not only as makeshift shelters but also for the transportation of Iraqi [[prisoners of war]]. Holes were cut in the containers to allow for ventilation. Containers continue to be used for military shelters, often additionally fortified by adding sandbags to the side walls to protect against weapons such as rocket-propelled grenades (\"RPGs\").\n\nThe abundance and relative cheapness of these containers during the last decade comes from the deficit in manufactured goods coming from [[North America]] in the last two decades.  These manufactured goods come to North America from Asia and, to a lesser extent, Europe, in containers that often have to be shipped back empty, or \"deadhead\", at considerable expense. It is often cheaper to buy new containers in Asia than to ship old ones back. Therefore, new applications are sought for the used containers that have reached their North American destination.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Shipping container clinic]]\n* [[Containerization]]\n* [[Modular building]]\n* [[Prefabricated building]]\n* [[Alternative housing]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n; Books\n*Kotnik, Jure (2008).

Adults measure {{convert|7-12|cm|in|abbr=on}} in total and are usually dark grey to blue on the back and sides, with an orange belly and throat. Males are more conspicuously coloured than the drab females, especially during breeding season.\n\nThe alpine newt occurs at high altitude as well as in the lowlands. Living mainly in forested land habitats for most of the year, the adults migrate to puddles, ponds, lakes or similar water bodies for breeding. Males court females with a ritualised [[courtship display|display]] and deposit a [[spermatophore]]. After fertilisation, females usually fold their eggs into leaves of water plants. The [[larva]]e grow up to {{convert|5|cm|in|abbr=on}} before [[metamorphosis|metamorphosing]] into terrestrial [[eft]]s. [[Paedomorphic]] adults, which keep their [[gills]] and stay aquatic, are common. Larvae and adults feed mainly on diverse [[invertebrates]] and fall themselves prey to [[dragonfly]] larvae, large [[beetles]], fish, snakes, birds or mammals.\n\n[[Populations]] of the alpine newt have started to diverge around 20 [[million years ago]]. At least four [[subspecies]] are distinguished, and some argue there are several distinct, [[cryptic species|cryptic]] species. Although still relatively common and classified at [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]], alpine newt populations are decreasing and have locally gone extinct. The main threats are [[habitat destruction]], [[water pollution|pollution]] and the introduction of fish such as [[trout]] into breeding sites.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n\n===Nomenclature===\n\nThe alpine newt was first described in 1768 by Austrian zoologist [[Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti]], as ''Triton alpestris'' from the [[\u00d6tscher]] mountain in the Austrian Alps (''alpestris'' meaning \"alpine\" in Latin).{{r|Laurenti1768}} He used that name for a female and described the male (''Triton salamandroides'') and the larva (''Proteus tritonius'') as different species.{{r|Schmidtler2007}} Later, the alpine newt was placed in the genus ''[[Triturus]]'' along with most other European newts. After this genus was found to contain several unrelated lineages based on genetic evidence,{{r|WeisrockPapenfuss2006|SteinfartzVicario2007}} the alpine newt was split off by Garc\u00eda-Par\u00eds and colleages as the [[monotypic]] genus ''Mesotriton'' in 2004,{{r|Garcia-Paris2004}} which had been erected as a [[subgenus]] by [[Istv\u00e1n J\u00f3zsef Bolkay]] in 1928.{{r|Bolkay1928}} However, the name ''Ichthyosaura'' was already introduced in 1801 by [[Sonnini de Manoncourt]] and [[Latreille]] for \"''Proteus tritonius''\", the larva of the alpine newt.{{r|SonniniLatreille1802|p=310}} It therefore has priority over ''Mesotriton'' and is the [[valid name (zoology)|valid]] genus name.{{r|1=Schmidtler2009|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=9-10}} \"Ichthyosaura\", Greek for \"fish lizard\", refers to a [[nymph]]-like creature in [[classical mythology]].{{r|Schmidtler2009}}\n\n===Subspecies===\n\nA number of geographic [[subspecies]] have been described, but many were not recognised by later authors. Differences in body shape and colour are not consistent.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=214|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=16-36}} Ro\u010dek and colleagues (2003),{{r|Rocek2003}} followed by later authors,{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=214|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=16-36}} recognised four subspecies (see table below). [[Molecular phylogenetics]] confirmed five distinct lineages, which correspond only in part to these subspecies: The western [[population]]s of the [[nominate subspecies]] ''I. a. alpestris'', together with the [[Cantabrian Mountains|Cantabrian]] ''I. a. cyreni'' and the [[Apennines|Apennine]] ''I. a. apuana'' form one group, while the eastern populations of ''I. a. alpestris'' are genetically closer to the Greek ''I. a. veluchiensis''.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014}}\n\nSeveral authors argued that the ancient lineages of the alpine newt might represent [[cryptic species]].{{r|Frost2020|Raffaelli2018}} An article from 2018 therefore distinguished four species,{{r|Raffaelli2018}} but this was considered premature in ''Amphibian Species of the World''.{{r|Frost2020}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n! colspan=2; style=\"background: rgb(235,235,210)\" | Subspecies{{r|1=Rocek2003|2=Sparreboom2014|p2=214|3=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p3=16-36}} !! style=\"background: rgb(235,235,210)\" | Distribution !! style=\"background: rgb(235,235,210)\" | Alternative classification{{r|Raffaelli2018}}\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| rowspan=2 | ''I. a. alpestris'' {{small|(Laurenti, 1768)}}<br>\u2013 Alpine newt || western populations || Northwestern France to northern Carpathians in Romania, southern Denmark in to Alps and France just north of the Mediterranean || Subspecies ''I. alpestris alpestris''\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| eastern populations || [[Balkan peninsula]] north of Greece to Bulgaria and southern Carpathians in Romania || Species ''I. reiseri'', with subspecies ''reiseri'', ''carpathica'' and ''montenegrina''\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| colspan=2 | ''I. a. apuana'' {{small|(Gray, 1850)}}<br>\u2013 Apennine alpine newt || Extreme southeastern France, Apennines to [[Lazio]] in central Italy, isolated populations in [[Calabria]] || Species ''I. apuana'', with subspecies ''apuana'' and ''inexpectata'' (Calabria)\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| colspan=2 | ''I. a. cyreni'' {{small|(Mertens & Muller, 1940)}}<br>\u2013 Cantabrian alpine newt || Spain: Cantabrian mountains and [[Sierra de Guadarrama]] (introduced) || Subspecies ''I. alpestris cyreni''\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| colspan=2 | ''I. a. veluchiensis'' {{small|(Wolterstorff, 1935)}}<br>\u2013 Greek alpine newt || Greece: mainland and northern [[Peloponnese]] || Species ''I. veluchiensis''\n\n|}\n\n==Description==\n\n[[File:Bergmolchwerbung_2.jpg|thumb|left|Dorsal view of a male (bright blue, left) courting a female (mottled grey, right) in a shallow pond]]\n\n[[File:Mesotriton_aplestris_ventral_view_chrischan.jpeg|thumb|left|Throat and belly are orange and usually unspotted.]]\n\nThe alpine newt is a medium-sized, stocky newt species. It reaches {{convert|7\u201312|cm|in|abbr=on}} length in total, with females roughly {{convert|1\u20132|cm|in|abbr=on}} longer than males. The tail is half as long or slightly shorter than the rest of the body and laterally compressed. During life in water, both sexes develop a tail [[fin]], and males a low (up to 2.5 mm), smooth-edged crest on the back. The [[cloaca]] of males swells during breeding season. The skin is smooth during and granular outside breeding season, and velvety during the land phase.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=213|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=10-13}}\n\nThe characteristic dark grey to bright blue colour of the back and sides, mainly in males, is strongest during breeding season. This base colour may vary to greenish and is more drab and mottled in females. The belly and throat are orange and only occasionally (especially in the subspecies ''I. a. apuana'') have dark spots. Males have a white band with black spots and a light blue flash running along the flanks, from the cheeks to the tail. Their crest, during breeding season, is white with regular dark spots. Juvenile [[eft]]s, just after [[metamorphosis]], resemble adult terrestrial females, but sometimes have a red or yellow line on the back. Very rarely, [[leucistic]] individuals have been observed.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=213|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=12-36}}\n\n[[Larvae]] are 7\u201311 mm long after hatching and grow to {{convert|3\u20135|cm|in|abbr=on}} just before metamorphosis. They initially have only two small filaments (balancers), between the eyes and [[gills]] on each side of the head, which later disappear when the fore- and then the hindlegs develop.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=215|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=97-104}} The larvae are light brown to yellow and initially have dark longitudinal stripes, which later dissove into a dark pigmentation that is stronger towards the tail. The tail is pointed and sometimes ends in a short filament. Alpine newt larvae are more robust and have wider heads that those of the [[smooth newt]] and [[palmate newt]].{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=215|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=13-14}}\n\n==Distribution==\n\nThe alpine newt is native to continental Europe. It is relatively common over a large, more or less continuous range from northwestern France to the [[Carpathians]] in Romania, and from southern Denmark in the north to the [[Alps]] and France just north of the Mediterranean in the south, but absent from the [[Pannonian basin]]. Isolated areas of distribution in Spain, Italy and Greece correspond to distinct subspecies (see section ''Taxonomy: Subspecies'' above).{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=214\u2013215|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=39-46|3=RecueroBuckley2014|4=Raffaelli2018}} Alpine newts have been deliberately [[Introduced species|introduced]] to various places in continental Europe, including within the boundaries of cities such as [[Bremen]] and [[Berlin]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=39-46}} More distant introductions have occurred to [[Great Britain]], mainly England but also Scotland,{{r|BondNHSN}} and New Zealand.{{r|Bell2016}}\n\nThe alpine newt can occur at high elevation and has been found up to {{convert|2370|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[above sea level]] in the Alps. However, it does occur in the lowlands down to sea level. Towards the south of its range, most populations are found above {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}}.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=51-59}}\n\n==Habitats==\n\nForests, including both [[deciduous forest|deciduous]] and [[coniferous]] forests (pure [[Picea abies|spruce]] plantations are avoided), are the main land habitat. Less common are forest edges, [[brownfield land]], or gardens. Populations can be found above [[tree line]] in the high mountains, where they prefer south-exposed slopes. The newts use logs, stones, leaf litter, [[burrow]]s, [[construction waste]] or similar structures as hiding places.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=54-59}}\n\nAquatic breeding sites close to adequate land habitat are critical. While small, cool water bodies in forested areas are preferred, alpine newts tolerate a wide range of permanent or [[vernal pool|non-permanent]], natural or human-made water bodies. These can range from shallow puddles over small ponds to larger, fish-free lakes or reservoirs and quiet parts of streams. Damming by [[Eurasian beaver|beavers]] creates suitable breeding sites. Overall, the alpine newt is tolerant regarding chemical parameters such as [[pH]], [[water hardness]] and [[eutrophication]]. Other European newts such as the [[Northern crested newt|crested]], smooth, palmate or [[Carpathian newt]] often use the same breeding sites, but are less common at higher elevation.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=47-54}}\n\n==Life and behaviour==\n\nAlpine newts are usually [[semiaquatic]], spending most of the year (9\u201310 months) on land and only returning to the water for breeding. The juvenile efts are probably terrestrial until they reach [[sexual maturity]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=54}} This happens after around three years in males, and four to five years in females. Alpine newts can reach an age of ten years in lowland. At higher altitude, maturity is reached only after 9-11 years, and the newts can grow up to 30 years old.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=215}}\n\n===Terrestrial phase===\n\n[[File:Alpine_Newt_(Ichthyosaura_alpestris)_hibernating_in_dead_wood_(13537518605).jpg | thumb | right | Juvenile hibernating in dead wood]]\n\nOn land, alpine newts are mainly nocturnal, hiding most of the day and moving and feeding during the night or in the [[twighlight]]. [[Hibernation]] also usually takes place in terrestrial hiding places. They have been observed to climb up to {{convert|2|m|ft}} high vertical walls of basement ducts, where they hibernated, on wet nights. {{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=105-107}} Migration to breeding sites occurs on sufficiently warm (above 5 \u00b0C) and humid nights and may be delayed or interrupted for several weeks in unfavourable conditions. The newts can also leave the water again in case of a sudden cold snap.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=89-90}}\n\nAlpine newts tend to stay close to their breeding sites and only a small proportion, mainly juveniles, [[Biological dispersal|disperse]] to new habitats. A dispersal distance of {{convert|4|km|mi|abbr=on}} has been observed, but such large distances are uncommon. Over short distances, the newts use mainly their smell for [[animal navigation|navigation]], while over long distances, orientation by the night sky, and potentially through [[magnetoreception]] are more important.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=122-128}} \n\n===Aquatic phase and breeding===\n\nThe aquatic phase starts at snow melt, from February in the lowlands to June at higher altitudes, while egg-laying follows a few months later and can continue until August.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=87-90}} Some southern populations in Greece and Italy appear to stay aquatic most of the year and hibernate under water.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=104-105}} In the Apennine subspecies, ''I. a. apuana'', two rounds of breeding and egg-laying in autumn and spring have been observed .{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=96}}\n\n[[File:Love-Is-Blind-Indiscriminate-Female-Mating-Responses-to-Male-Courtship-Pheromones-in-Newts-pone.0056538.s001.ogv|thumb|right|Stages of [[courtship display]], filmed in captivity{{r|Wicker-ThomasTreer2013}}]]\n\nBreeding behaviour occurs mainly in the morning and at dawn. Males perform a [[courtship display]]. The male first places himself in front of the female, remains static for a while, then fans his tail to stimulate the female and wave [[pheromones]] towards her. After leaning in and touching her snout, he creeps away, followed by the female. When she touches the base of his tail with her snout, he releases a sperm packet ([[spermatophore]]) and blocks the female's path so she picks it up with her cloaca. Several rounds of spermatophore deposition may follow. Males frequently interfere with displays of rivals.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=215}} Experiments suggested that it is mainly male pheromones that trigger mating behaviour in females, while colour and other visual cues are less relevant.{{r|Wicker-ThomasTreer2013}} In a breeding season, a male can produce more than 48 spermatophores, and offspring from one female has usually several fathers.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=83-86}}\n\n[[File:Triturus_alpestris_ovum.jpg|thumb|right|Egg with larvae just before hatching, note the longitudinal stripes]]\n\n[[File:MesotritonAlpestrisLarva1.JPG|thumb|right|Larva with fore- and hindlegs developed]]\n\nFemales wrap their eggs in leaves of water plants for protection, preferring leaves closer to the surface where temperatures are higher. Where no plants are available, they may also use leaf litter, dead wood or stones for egg deposition.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=94-104}} They can lay 70\u2013390 eggs in a season, which are light grey-brown and 1.5\u20131.7 mm in diameter (2.5\u20133 mm including the jelly capsule). Incubation time is longer under cold conditions, but larvae typically hatch after two to four weeks.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216}} The larvae are [[benthic]], staying in general close to the bottom of the water body.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=98}} Metamorphosis occurs after around three months, again depending on temperature, but some larvae overwinter and metamorphose only in the next year.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216}}\n\n===Paedomorphy===\n\n[[File:Mesotriton_alpestris_apuanus05.jpg|thumb|right|Paedomorphic adult of subspecies ''I. a. apuana'']]\n\n[[Paedomorphy]] (or neoteny), where adults do not metamorphose and instead retain their [[gill]]s and stay aquatic, is more common in the alpine newt than in other European newts. It is almost exclusively found in the southern part of the range (but not in the Cantabrian subspecies, ''I. a. cyreni''). Paedomorphic adults are more pale in colour than metamorphic ones. Only part of a population is usually paedomorphic, and metamorphosis can follow if the pool dries out. Paedomorphic and metamorphic newts sometimes prefer different prey, but they do interbreed. Overall, paedomorphy appears to be a facultative strategy under particular conditions which are not fully understood.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=60-65}}\n\n===Diet, predators and parasites===\n\nAlpine newts are diet generalists, taking mainly different [[invertebrates]] as prey. Larvae and adults living in the water eat for example various [[plankton]], larvae of insects such as [[chironomids]], crustaceans such as [[ostracods]] or [[amphipods]], and terrestrial insects falling on the surface. Amphibian eggs and larvae, including the same species, are also eaten. Prey on land includes various insects, worms, spiders or [[isopods]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=68-72}}\n\n[[Predator]]s taking adult alpine newts are snakes such as the [[grass snake]], fish such as [[trout]], birds such as [[heron]]s or [[duck]]s, and mammals such as [[hedgehogs]], [[marten]]s or [[shrew]]s. Under water, large diving beetles (''[[Dytiscus]]'') can prey on newts, while small juveniles on land may be predated by ground beetles (''[[Carabus]]''). For eggs and larvae, diving beetles, fish, [[dragonfly]] larvae, and other newts are the main enemies.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=73-77}}\n\nThreatened adult newts often take on a defensive position, where they expose the [[aposematism|warning colour]] of their belly by bending backwards or raising their tail and secrete a milky substance. They also sometimes produce sounds, whose function is however unknown.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=74-75}}\n\nParasites include [[parasitic worm]]s, [[leeches]], the ciliate ''[[Balantidium elongatum]]'', and potentially [[Lucilia bufonivora|toadflies]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=77}} A [[ranavirus]] transmitted to alpine newts from [[midwife toad]]s in Spain caused bleeding and [[necrosis]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=142}} The [[chytridiomycosis]]-causing fungus ''[[Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis]]'' has been found in wild populations,<ref name=\"ZampigliaCanestrelli2013\"/> and the emerging ''[[Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans|B. salamandrivorans]]'' was lethal for alpine newts in laboratory experiments.<ref name=\"MartelBlooi2014\"/>\n\n==Evolution==\n\nAlpine newt populations have separated since the [[Early Miocene]], around 20 [[million years ago]], according to a [[molecular clock]] estimate.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014}} Known fossil remains are much more recent: they were found in the [[Pliocene]] of Slovakia{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=38}} and the [[Pleistocene]] of Northern Italy.{{r|VillaBlain2018}} An older, [[Miocene]] fossil from Germany, ''[[Ichthyosaura randeckensis]]'', may be the [[sister species]] of the alpine newt.{{r|Schoch2013}}\n\nMolecular phylogenetic analyses showed that alpine newts split into a western and an eastern group. Each of these again contains two major [[Lineage (evolution)|lineages]], which in part correspond to described subspecies (see section ''Distribution and subspecies'' above).{{r|RecueroBuckley2014|SotiropoulosEleftherakos2007}} These ancient genetic differences suggest that the alpine newt may be a [[species complex|complex]] of several distinct species.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014|Frost2020|Raffaelli2018}} Higher temperatures during the Miocene or sea level oscillations may have separated early populations, leading to [[allopatric speciation]]. However, [[genetic admixture|admixture]] and [[introgression]] between lineages probably took place. Populations from [[Vlasina Lake]] in Serbia have [[mitochondrial DNA]] that is distinct from all other populations and may represent a [[ghost lineage]] inherited from a now extinct ancestor population.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014}} The [[Quaternary glaciation]] probably led to cycles of retreat into [[Refugium (population biology)|refugia]], expansion and range shifts.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014|ChiocchioBisconti2017}}\n\n==Captivity==\n\nSeveral subspecies of the alpine newt have been bred in captivity, including a population from [[Proko\u0161ko Lake]] in Bosnia that is now probably extinct in the wild. Juveniles often return to the water after only one year. Captive individuals have reached an age of 15-20 years.{{r|1=Raffaelli2014|2=Sparreboom2014|p2=217}}\n\n==Threats and conservation==\n\nBecause of its overall large range and populations that are not severely fragmented, the alpine newt was classified as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]] in 2009. The population trend however is \"Decreasing\", and the different geographic lineages, which may represent [[evolutionary significant units]], have not been evaluated separately.{{r|iucn}} Several populations in the Balkans, some of which have been described as subspecies of their own, are highly threatened or have even gone extinct.{{r|1=Raffaelli2018|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=133-134}}\n\nThreats are similar to those affecting other newts and include mainly [[habitat destruction|destruction]] and [[water pollution|pollution]] of aquatic habitats. [[European beaver|Beavers]], previously widespread in Europe, were probably important in maintaining breeding sites. Introduction of fish, especially [[salmonids]] such as trout, and potentially [[crayfish]] is a significant threat that can eradicate populations from a breeding site. In the [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] [[karst]] region, populations have declined as ponds created for cattle and human use were abandoned over the last decades. Lack of adequate, undisturbed land habitat (see section ''Habitats'' above) and [[wildlife corridor|dispersal corridors]] around and between breeding sites, is another problem.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=130-144}}\n\nIntroduced alpine newts may themselves pose a threat to native amphibians if they carry disease. At least one introduced population in the United Kingdom was affected by chytridiomycosis,{{r|iucn}} and for the exotic subspecies ''I. a. apuana'' in New Zealand, eradication was recommended.{{r|Bell2016}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist | 30em | refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Bell2016\">{{cite journal | last=Bell | first=B.D. | title = A review of potential alpine newt (''Ichthyosaura alpestris'') impacts on native frogs in New Zealand | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of New Zealand | volume = 46 | issue=3\u20134 | year = 2016 | pages = 214\u2013231 | issn=0303-6758 | doi = 10.1080/03036758.2016.1216455}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Bolkay1928\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bolkay | first1 = J. | title = Die Sch\u00e4del der Salamandrinen, mit besonderer R\u00fccksicht auf ihre systematische Bedeutung | journal = Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Anatomie und Entwicklungsgeschichte | volume = 86 | issue = 3\u20134 | year = 1928 | pages = 259\u2013319 | issn = 0340-2061 |doi = 10.1007/BF02117989 | language = German}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BondNHSN\">{{cite web | last1 = Bond | first1 = I. | title = Alpine Newt | year = 2020 | publisher = Natural History Society of Northumbria | url = https://www.nhsn.ncl.ac.uk/interests/reptiles-amphibians/alpine-newt/ | accessdate = 5 April 2020 | archiveurl = | archive-date = 22 September 2019 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190922004603/https://www.nhsn.ncl.ac.uk/interests/reptiles-amphibians/alpine-newt/ }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"ChiocchioBisconti2017\">{{cite journal | last1 = Chiocchio | first1 = A. | last2 = Bisconti | first2 = R. | last3 = Zampiglia | first3 = M. |last4 = Nascetti | first4 = G. | last5 = Canestrelli | first5 = D. | title = Quaternary history, population genetic structure and diversity of the cold-adapted Alpine newt ''Ichthyosaura alpestris'' in peninsular Italy | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | year = 2017 | pages = 2955 | issn = 2045-2322 | doi = 10.1038/s41598-017-03116-x| pmid = 28592856 | pmc = 5462806 | bibcode = 2017NatSR...7.2955C }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Frost2020\">{{ Cite document |last=Frost |first=D.R. | year = 2020 | title = ''Ichthyosaura alpestris'' (Laurenti, 1768).

to [[continental Europe]] and introduced to [[Great Britain]] and [[New Zealand]]. Adults measure {{convert|7-12|cm|in|abbr=on}} in total and are usually dark grey to blue on the back and sides, with an orange belly and throat. Males are more conspicuously coloured than the drab females, especially during breeding season.\n\nThe alpine newt occurs at high altitude as well as in the lowlands. Living mainly in forested land habitats for most of the year, the adults migrate to puddles, ponds, lakes or similar water bodies for breeding. Males court females with a ritualised [[courtship display|display]] and deposit a [[spermatophore]]. After fertilisation, females usually fold their eggs into leaves of water plants. The [[larva]]e grow up to {{convert|5|cm|in|abbr=on}} before [[metamorphosis|metamorphosing]] into terrestrial [[eft]]s. [[Paedomorphic]] adults, which keep their [[gills]] and stay aquatic, are common. Larvae and adults feed mainly on diverse [[invertebrates]] and fall themselves prey to [[dragonfly]] larvae, large [[beetles]], fish, snakes, birds or mammals.\n\n[[Populations]] of the alpine newt have started to diverge around 20 [[million years ago]]. At least four [[subspecies]] are distinguished, and some argue there are several distinct, [[cryptic species|cryptic]] species. Although still relatively common and classified at [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]], alpine newt populations are decreasing and have locally gone extinct. The main threats are [[habitat destruction]], [[water pollution|pollution]] and the introduction of fish such as [[trout]] into breeding sites.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n\n===Nomenclature===\n\nThe alpine newt was first described in 1768 by Austrian zoologist [[Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti]], as ''Triton alpestris'' from the [[\u00d6tscher]] mountain in the Austrian Alps (''alpestris'' meaning \"alpine\" in Latin).{{r|Laurenti1768}} He used that name for a female and described the male (''Triton salamandroides'') and the larva (''Proteus tritonius'') as different species.{{r|Schmidtler2007}} Later, the alpine newt was placed in the genus ''[[Triturus]]'' along with most other European newts. After this genus was found to contain several unrelated lineages based on genetic evidence,{{r|WeisrockPapenfuss2006|SteinfartzVicario2007}} the alpine newt was split off by Garc\u00eda-Paris and colleages as the [[monotypic]] genus ''Mesotriton'' in 2004,{{r|Garcia-Paris2004}} which had been erected as a [[subgenus]] by [[Istv\u00e1n J\u00f3zsef Bolkay]] in 1928.{{r|Bolkay1928}} However, the name ''Ichthyosaura'' was already introduced in 1801 by [[Sonnini de Manoncourt]] and [[Latreille]] for \"''Proteus tritonius''\", the larva of the alpine newt.{{r|SonniniLatreille1802|p=310}} It therefore has priority over ''Mesotriton'' and is the [[valid name (zoology)|valid]] genus name.{{r|1=Schmidtler2009|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=9-10}} \"Ichthyosaura\", Greek for \"fish lizard\", refers to a [[nymph]]-like creature in [[classical mythology]].{{r|Schmidtler2009}}\n\n===Subspecies===\n\nA number of geographic [[subspecies]] have been described, but many were not recognised by later authors. Differences in body shape and colour are not consistent.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=214|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=16-36}} Ro\u010dek and colleagues (2003),{{r|Rocek2003}} followed by later authors,{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=214|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=16-36}} recognised four subspecies (see table below). [[Molecular phylogenetics]] confirmed five distinct lineages, which correspond only in part to these subspecies: The western [[population]]s of the [[nominate subspecies]] ''I. a. alpestris'', together with the [[Cantabrian Mountains|Cantabrian]] ''I. a. cyreni'' and the [[Apennines|Apennine]] ''I. a. apuana'' form one group, while the eastern populations of ''I. a. alpestris'' are genetically closer to the Greek ''I. a. veluchiensis''.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014}}\n\nSeveral authors argued that the ancient lineages of the alpine newt might represent [[cryptic species]].{{r|Frost2020|Raffaelli2018}} An article from 2018 therefore distinguished four species,{{r|Raffaelli2018}} but this was considered premature in ''Amphibian Species of the World''.{{r|Frost2020}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n! colspan=2; style=\"background: rgb(235,235,210)\" | Subspecies{{r|1=Rocek2003|2=Sparreboom2014|p2=214|3=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p3=16-36}} !! style=\"background: rgb(235,235,210)\" | Distribution !! style=\"background: rgb(235,235,210)\" | Alternative classification{{r|Raffaelli2018}}\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| rowspan=2 | ''I. a. alpestris'' {{small|(Laurenti, 1768)}}<br>\u2013 Alpine newt || western populations || Northwestern France to northern Carpathians in Romania, southern Denmark in to Alps and France just north of the Mediterranean || Subspecies ''I. alpestris alpestris''\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| eastern populations || [[Balkan peninsula]] north of Greece to Bulgaria and southern Carpathians in Romania || Species ''I. reiseri'', with subspecies ''reiseri'', ''carpathica'' and ''montenegrina''\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| colspan=2 | ''I. a. apuana'' {{small|(Gray, 1850)}}<br>\u2013 Apennine alpine newt || Extreme southeastern France, Apennines to [[Lazio]] in central Italy, isolated populations in [[Calabria]] || Species ''I. apuana'', with subspecies ''apuana'' and ''inexpectata'' (Calabria)\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| colspan=2 | ''I. a. cyreni'' {{small|(Mertens & Muller, 1940)}}<br>\u2013 Cantabrian alpine newt || Spain: Cantabrian mountains and [[Sierra de Guadarrama]] (introduced) || Subspecies ''I. alpestris cyreni''\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| colspan=2 | ''I. a. veluchiensis'' {{small|(Wolterstorff, 1935)}}<br>\u2013 Greek alpine newt || Greece: mainland and northern [[Peloponnese]] || Species ''I. veluchiensis''\n\n|}\n\n==Description==\n\n[[File:Bergmolchwerbung_2.jpg|thumb|left|Dorsal view of a male (bright blue, left) courting a female (mottled grey, right) in a shallow pond]]\n\n[[File:Mesotriton_aplestris_ventral_view_chrischan.jpeg|thumb|left|Throat and belly are orange and usually unspotted.]]\n\nThe alpine newt is a medium-sized, stocky newt species. It reaches {{convert|7\u201312|cm|in|abbr=on}} length in total, with females roughly {{convert|1\u20132|cm|in|abbr=on}} longer than males. The tail is half as long or slightly shorter than the rest of the body and laterally compressed. During life in water, both sexes develop a tail [[fin]], and males a low (up to 2.5 mm), smooth-edged crest on the back. The [[cloaca]] of males swells during breeding season. The skin is smooth during and granular outside breeding season, and velvety during the land phase.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=213|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=10-13}}\n\nThe characteristic dark grey to bright blue colour of the back and sides, mainly in males, is strongest during breeding season. This base colour may vary to greenish and is more drab and mottled in females. The belly and throat are orange and only occasionally (especially in the subspecies ''I. a. apuana'') have dark spots. Males have a white band with black spots and a light blue flash running along the flanks, from the cheeks to the tail. Their crest, during breeding season, is white with regular dark spots. Juvenile [[eft]]s, just after [[metamorphosis]], resemble adult terrestrial females, but sometimes have a red or yellow line on the back. Very rarely, [[leucistic]] individuals have been observed.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=213|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=12-36}}\n\n[[Larvae]] are 7\u201311 mm long after hatching and grow to {{convert|3\u20135|cm|in|abbr=on}} just before metamorphosis. They initially have only two small filaments (balancers), between the eyes and [[gills]] on each side of the head, which later disappear when the fore- and then the hindlegs develop.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=215|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=97-104}} The larvae are light brown to yellow and initially have dark longitudinal stripes, which later dissove into a dark pigmentation that is stronger towards the tail. The tail is pointed and sometimes ends in a short filament. Alpine newt larvae are more robust and have wider heads that those of the [[smooth newt]] and [[palmate newt]].{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=215|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=13-14}}\n\n==Distribution==\n\nThe alpine newt is native to continental Europe. It is relatively common over a large, more or less continuous range from northwestern France to the [[Carpathians]] in Romania, and from southern Denmark in the north to the [[Alps]] and France just north of the Mediterranean in the south, but absent from the [[Pannonian basin]]. Isolated areas of distribution in Spain, Italy and Greece correspond to distinct subspecies (see section ''Taxonomy: Subspecies'' above).{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=214\u2013215|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=39-46|3=RecueroBuckley2014|4=Raffaelli2018}} Alpine newts have been deliberately [[Introduced species|introduced]] to various places in continental Europe, including within the boundaries of cities such as [[Bremen]] and [[Berlin]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=39-46}} More distant introductions have occurred to [[Great Britain]], mainly England but also Scotland,{{r|BondNHSN}} and New Zealand.{{r|Bell2016}}\n\nThe alpine newt can occur at high elevation and has been found up to {{convert|2370|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[above sea level]] in the Alps. However, it does occur in the lowlands down to sea level. Towards the south of its range, most populations are found above {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}}.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=51-59}}\n\n==Habitats==\n\nForests, including both [[deciduous forest|deciduous]] and [[coniferous]] forests (pure [[Picea abies|spruce]] plantations are avoided), are the main land habitat. Less common are forest edges, [[brownfield land]], or gardens. Populations can be found above [[tree line]] in the high mountains, where they prefer south-exposed slopes. The newts use logs, stones, leaf litter, [[burrow]]s, [[construction waste]] or similar structures as hiding places.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=54-59}}\n\nAquatic breeding sites close to adequate land habitat are critical. While small, cool water bodies in forested areas are preferred, alpine newts tolerate a wide range of permanent or [[vernal pool|non-permanent]], natural or human-made water bodies. These can range from shallow puddles over small ponds to larger, fish-free lakes or reservoirs and quiet parts of streams. Damming by [[Eurasian beaver|beavers]] creates suitable breeding sites. Overall, the alpine newt is tolerant regarding chemical parameters such as [[pH]], [[water hardness]] and [[eutrophication]]. Other European newts such as the [[Northern crested newt|crested]], smooth, palmate or [[Carpathian newt]] often use the same breeding sites, but are less common at higher elevation.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=47-54}}\n\n==Life and behaviour==\n\nAlpine newts are usually [[semiaquatic]], spending most of the year (9\u201310 months) on land and only returning to the water for breeding. The juvenile efts are probably terrestrial until they reach [[sexual maturity]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=54}} This happens after around three years in males, and four to five years in females. Alpine newts can reach an age of ten years in lowland. At higher altitude, maturity is reached only after 9-11 years, and the newts can grow up to 30 years old.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=215}}\n\n===Terrestrial phase===\n\n[[File:Alpine_Newt_(Ichthyosaura_alpestris)_hibernating_in_dead_wood_(13537518605).jpg | thumb | right | Juvenile hibernating in dead wood]]\n\nOn land, alpine newts are mainly nocturnal, hiding most of the day and moving and feeding during the night or in the [[twighlight]]. [[Hibernation]] also usually takes place in terrestrial hiding places. They have been observed to climb up to {{convert|2|m|ft}} high vertical walls of basement ducts, where they hibernated, on wet nights. {{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=105-107}} Migration to breeding sites occurs on sufficiently warm (above 5 \u00b0C) and humid nights and may be delayed or interrupted for several weeks in unfavourable conditions. The newts can also leave the water again in case of a sudden cold snap.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=89-90}}\n\nAlpine newts tend to stay close to their breeding sites and only a small proportion, mainly juveniles, [[Biological dispersal|disperse]] to new habitats. A dispersal distance of {{convert|4|km|mi|abbr=on}} has been observed, but such large distances are uncommon. Over short distances, the newts use mainly their smell for [[animal navigation|navigation]], while over long distances, orientation by the night sky, and potentially through [[magnetoreception]] are more important.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=122-128}} \n\n===Aquatic phase and breeding===\n\nThe aquatic phase starts at snow melt, from February in the lowlands to June at higher altitudes, while egg-laying follows a few months later and can continue until August.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=87-90}} Some southern populations in Greece and Italy appear to stay aquatic most of the year and hibernate under water.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=104-105}} In the Apennine subspecies, ''I. a. apuana'', two rounds of breeding and egg-laying in autumn and spring have been observed .{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=96}}\n\n[[File:Love-Is-Blind-Indiscriminate-Female-Mating-Responses-to-Male-Courtship-Pheromones-in-Newts-pone.0056538.s001.ogv|thumb|right|Stages of [[courtship display]], filmed in captivity{{r|Wicker-ThomasTreer2013}}]]\n\nBreeding behaviour occurs mainly in the morning and at dawn. Males perform a [[courtship display]]. The male first places himself in front of the female, remains static for a while, then fans his tail to stimulate the female and wave [[pheromones]] towards her. After leaning in and touching her snout, he creeps away, followed by the female. When she touches the base of his tail with her snout, he releases a sperm packet ([[spermatophore]]) and blocks the female's path so she picks it up with her cloaca. Several rounds of spermatophore deposition may follow. Males frequently interfere with displays of rivals.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=215}} Experiments suggested that it is mainly male pheromones that trigger mating behaviour in females, while colour and other visual cues are less relevant.{{r|Wicker-ThomasTreer2013}} In a breeding season, a male can produce more than 48 spermatophores, and offspring from one female has usually several fathers.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=83-86}}\n\n[[File:Triturus_alpestris_ovum.jpg|thumb|right|Egg with larvae just before hatching, note the longitudinal stripes]]\n\n[[File:MesotritonAlpestrisLarva1.JPG|thumb|right|Larva with fore- and hindlegs developed]]\n\nFemales wrap their eggs in leaves of water plants for protection, preferring leaves closer to the surface where temperatures are higher. Where no plants are available, they may also use leaf litter, dead wood or stones for egg deposition.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=94-104}} They can lay 70\u2013390 eggs in a season, which are light grey-brown and 1.5\u20131.7 mm in diameter (2.5\u20133 mm including the jelly capsule). Incubation time is longer under cold conditions, but larvae typically hatch after two to four weeks.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216}} The larvae are [[benthic]], staying in general close to the bottom of the water body.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=98}} Metamorphosis occurs after around three months, again depending on temperature, but some larvae overwinter and metamorphose only in the next year.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216}}\n\n===Paedomorphy===\n\n[[File:Mesotriton_alpestris_apuanus05.jpg|thumb|right|Paedomorphic adult of subspecies ''I. a. apuana'']]\n\n[[Paedomorphy]] (or neoteny), where adults do not metamorphose and instead retain their [[gill]]s and stay aquatic, is more common in the alpine newt than in other European newts. It is almost exclusively found in the southern part of the range (but not in the Cantabrian subspecies, ''I. a. cyreni''). Paedomorphic adults are more pale in colour than metamorphic ones. Only part of a population is usually paedomorphic, and metamorphosis can follow if the pool dries out. Paedomorphic and metamorphic newts sometimes prefer different prey, but they do interbreed. Overall, paedomorphy appears to be a facultative strategy under particular conditions which are not fully understood.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=60-65}}\n\n===Diet, predators and parasites===\n\nAlpine newts are diet generalists, taking mainly different [[invertebrates]] as prey. Larvae and adults living in the water eat for example various [[plankton]], larvae of insects such as [[chironomids]], crustaceans such as [[ostracods]] or [[amphipods]], and terrestrial insects falling on the surface. Amphibian eggs and larvae, including the same species, are also eaten. Prey on land includes various insects, worms, spiders or [[isopods]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=68-72}}\n\n[[Predator]]s taking adult alpine newts are snakes such as the [[grass snake]], fish such as [[trout]], birds such as [[heron]]s or [[duck]]s, and mammals such as [[hedgehogs]], [[marten]]s or [[shrew]]s. Under water, large diving beetles (''[[Dytiscus]]'') can prey on newts, while small juveniles on land may be predated by ground beetles (''[[Carabus]]''). For eggs and larvae, diving beetles, fish, [[dragonfly]] larvae, and other newts are the main enemies.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=73-77}}\n\nThreatened adult newts often take on a defensive position, where they expose the [[aposematism|warning colour]] of their belly by bending backwards or raising their tail and secrete a milky substance. They also sometimes produce sounds, whose function is however unknown.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=74-75}}\n\nParasites include [[parasitic worm]]s, [[leeches]], the ciliate ''[[Balantidium elongatum]]'', and potentially [[Lucilia bufonivora|toadflies]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=77}} A [[ranavirus]] transmitted to alpine newts from [[midwife toad]]s in Spain caused bleeding and [[necrosis]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=142}} The [[chytridiomycosis]]-causing fungus ''[[Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis]]'' has been found in wild populations,<ref name=\"ZampigliaCanestrelli2013\"/> and the emerging ''[[Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans|B. salamandrivorans]]'' was lethal for alpine newts in laboratory experiments.<ref name=\"MartelBlooi2014\"/>\n\n==Evolution==\n\nAlpine newt populations have separated since the [[Early Miocene]], around 20 [[million years ago]], according to a [[molecular clock]] estimate.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014}} Known fossil remains are much more recent: they were found in the [[Pliocene]] of Slovakia{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=38}} and the [[Pleistocene]] of Northern Italy.{{r|VillaBlain2018}} An older, [[Miocene]] fossil from Germany, ''[[Ichthyosaura randeckensis]]'', may be the [[sister species]] of the alpine newt.{{r|Schoch2013}}\n\nMolecular phylogenetic analyses showed that alpine newts split into a western and an eastern group. Each of these again contains two major [[Lineage (evolution)|lineages]], which in part correspond to described subspecies (see section ''Distribution and subspecies'' above).{{r|RecueroBuckley2014|SotiropoulosEleftherakos2007}} These ancient genetic differences suggest that the alpine newt may be a [[species complex|complex]] of several distinct species.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014|Frost2020|Raffaelli2018}} Higher temperatures during the Miocene or sea level oscillations may have separated early populations, leading to [[allopatric speciation]]. However, [[genetic admixture|admixture]] and [[introgression]] between lineages probably took place. Populations from [[Vlasina Lake]] in Serbia have [[mitochondrial DNA]] that is distinct from all other populations and may represent a [[ghost lineage]] inherited from a now extinct ancestor population.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014}} The [[Quaternary glaciation]] probably led to cycles of retreat into [[Refugium (population biology)|refugia]], expansion and range shifts.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014|ChiocchioBisconti2017}}\n\n==Captivity==\n\nSeveral subspecies of the alpine newt have been bred in captivity, including a population from [[Proko\u0161ko Lake]] in Bosnia that is now probably extinct in the wild. Juveniles often return to the water after only one year. Captive individuals have reached an age of 15-20 years.{{r|1=Raffaelli2014|2=Sparreboom2014|p2=217}}\n\n==Threats and conservation==\n\nBecause of its overall large range and populations that are not severely fragmented, the alpine newt was classified as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]] in 2009. The population trend however is \"Decreasing\", and the different geographic lineages, which may represent [[evolutionary significant units]], have not been evaluated separately.{{r|iucn}} Several populations in the Balkans, some of which have been described as subspecies of their own, are highly threatened or have even gone extinct.{{r|1=Raffaelli2018|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=133-134}}\n\nThreats are similar to those affecting other newts and include mainly [[habitat destruction|destruction]] and [[water pollution|pollution]] of aquatic habitats. [[European beaver|Beavers]], previously widespread in Europe, were probably important in maintaining breeding sites. Introduction of fish, especially [[salmonids]] such as trout, and potentially [[crayfish]] is a significant threat that can eradicate populations from a breeding site. In the [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] [[karst]] region, populations have declined as ponds created for cattle and human use were abandoned over the last decades. Lack of adequate, undisturbed land habitat (see section ''Habitats'' above) and [[wildlife corridor|dispersal corridors]] around and between breeding sites, is another problem.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=130-144}}\n\nIntroduced alpine newts may themselves pose a threat to native amphibians if they carry disease.

Much like her mother, she also joined the women's organization, Kappa Kappa Gamma, and in 1910, she completed her degree specializing in geology.<ref name=\":0\" /> Three years later, Carter Edson returned to the University of Wisconsin to finish her master's degree.\n\n== Employment ==\n\nShe began her career as a Geologist at the Ecogal Exploration Company.<ref name=\"American Women 1940. P.260\"/> Edson joined [[Roxana Petroleum Corporation]], which was a subdivision of the Royal Dutch/[[Shell Group]], in her early years as a geologist in 1924.<ref name=\"WPGP\" /> Edson established the corporation's sample lab to aid in the growing [[Mid-Continent]] drilling area.<ref name=\"WPGP\" />  Her career at Roxana Petroleum Corporation ended in 1938, the same year she was chosen to be a Fellow of the [[Geological Society of America]].<ref name=\"WPGP\" /> After her time at Roxana Petroleum Corporation ended she found employment as the Chief Geologist at the Cimmaron Oil Company beginning in 1939.<ref name=\"American Women 1940. P.260\"/>\n\n== Field of study and research focus ==\nFanny Carter went to Wisconsin University for her master's degree, to then rejoin her husband. She worked at his company as an advisory geologist and then eventually a secretary-treasurer, which was not a part of her field. She went back to school again at Stanford university she became a graduate student instructor in the geology school. After taking many years of school for geology, and with special training and experience she began working in September 1924, with Roxana Petroleum corporation, that is now a part of the Shell Oil Company.\n\nMrs. Edson initially worked on the liberal latitude for Roxana, this means she was responsible for examining the samples from the well of subsurface sediments and create a stratigraphy \u201cmap\u201d of the layers of sediment. Fanny's work with the samples from the well and her stratigraphy sequences was helping the company's understanding of the subsurface Ordovician stratigraphy.\n\nUnder Fanny's supervision the lab staff grew in numbers and they began to be known for their volume and authentic character of their stratigraphic work, and also being the most efficient in the region. In 1932, Fanny Carter Edson received a signal honor, although she did not have numerous writings, she was the first women of commercial employment. She was the one women elected that year to the fellowship in the Geological Society of America, which at that time was exclusive and only included 10 other women. Fanny Carter was a petroleum geologist and was a member of the American association of petroleum geologists for 30 years.\n\n== Impact on women ==\nFanny Carter Edson's pursuit in geology has become an amazing example for woman all around the world in hopes to also pursue a career in the sciences. She was one of the few women who were early members of the geological profession. Because of this, all of her research and findings creates a precedence for the scientific and mathematical potential for all woman. Not only was Fanny a pioneer in her field, she was also a mother and a wife. Sending a message of women's capabilities to work while supporting and caring for a family. And even after the divorce, she was able to maintain her career while solely caring for her child.\n\n== Contribution to geology ==\nEdson's work was predominantly in the field of petroleum geology. Among her many contributions to her field she established a field laboratory facility in Tulsa, Oklahoma that examined well samples of subsurface sediments and devised methods of strati-graphic correlation and other practical applications of her findings. Her laboratory work was supplemented by field examination of outcrop sections in Oklahoma, and by participation in the wide-ranging field conferences through the Arbuckle and the Ozark mountains, the Missouri and the Mississippi river valleys, and along the Rocky Mountain front. Edson's work with the well samples and the strati-graphic sequences guided her company's understanding of the subsurface Ordovician stratigraphy. Further, her determinations and mapping of the subsurface pre-Mississippian rocks yielded for her company an accurate outline of the newly recognized Central Kansas uplift.\n\n== Personal life ==\nFanny Carter Edson was married to Frank Aaron Edson, whose work in iron-ore exploration made them travel to Minnesota. The Edson's moved in 1917 to Duluth, Minnesota. They then had their daughter in June. While the United States had entered the First World War, the duties of Fanny's husband with the Y.M.C.A. Field Service took him to various army training camps, while Fanny remained in Duluth. For three years she filled various clerical positions, and taught general science for one semester in public schools. Fanny and her daughter joined her husband in 1921 at Norman, Oklahoma, where he was employed on the Oklahoma Geological Survey. She continued and furthered her studies there for a few years. Now versed in geology, and with special training and experience in pre-Cambrian stratigraphy and structure, North American Mid-Continent geology, mineralogy and petrography, and phases of subsurface exploration, Fanny Carter Edson accepted employment with the Roxana Petroleum Corporation (now part of the Shell Oil Company) in September, 1924, at Tulsa, Oklahoma. There, she became solely responsible for the personal rearing of her daughter when she and her husband divorced in 1923. There she began the application of her science and her most rigorous studies to the vocation in which she was enthralled for the remainder of her life.\n\n== Achievements ==\nNearing the end of her career, Edson was employed at the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] (1942-1945). In addition to her fellowship at the Geological Society of American she was also a prominent member of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists and the Stratigraphic Society of Tulsa, Oklahoma.<ref name=\"American Women 1940.

Much like her mother, she also joined the women's organization, Kappa Kappa Gamma, and in 1910, she completed her degree specializing in geology.<ref name=\":0\" /> Three years later, Carter Edson returned to the University of Wisconsin to finish her master's degree.\n\n== Employment ==\n\nShe began her career as a Geologist at the Ecogal Exploration Company.<ref name=\"American Women 1940. P.260\"/> Edson joined [[Roxana Petroleum Corporation]], which was a subdivision of the Royal Dutch/[[Shell Group]], in her early years as a geologist in 1924.<ref name=\"WPGP\" /> Edson established the corporation's sample lab to aid in the growing [[Mid-Continent]] drilling area.<ref name=\"WPGP\" />  Her career at Roxana Petroleum Corporation ended in 1938, the same year she was chosen to be a Fellow of the [[Geological Society of America]].<ref name=\"WPGP\" /> After her time at Roxana Petroleum Corporation ended she found employment as the Chief Geologist at the Cimmaron Oil Company beginning in 1939.<ref name=\"American Women 1940. P.260\"/>\n\n== Field of study and research focus ==\nFanny Carter went to Wisconsin University for her master's degree, to then rejoin her husband. She worked at his company as an advisory geologist and then eventually a secretary-treasurer, which was not a part of her field. She went back to school again at Stanford university she became a graduate student instructor in the geology school. After taking many years of school for geology, and with special training and experience she began working in September 1924, with Roxana Petroleum corporation, that is now a part of the Shell Oil Company.\n\nMrs. Edson initially worked on the liberal latitude for Roxana, this means she was responsible for examining the samples from the well of subsurface sediments and create a stratigraphy \u201cmap\u201d of the layers of sediment. Fanny's work with the samples from the well and her stratigraphy sequences was helping the company's understanding of the subsurface Ordovician stratigraphy.\n\nUnder Fanny's supervision the lab staff grew in numbers and they began to be known for their volume and authentic character of their stratigraphic work, and also being the most efficient in the region. In 1932, Fanny Carter Edson received a signal honor, although she did not have numerous writings, she was the first women of commercial employment. She was the one women elected that year to the fellowship in the Geological Society of America, which at that time was exclusive and only included 10 other women. Fanny Carter was a petroleum geologist and was a member of the American association of petroleum geologists for 30 years.\n\n== Impact on women ==\nFanny Carter Edson's pursuit in geology has become an amazing example for woman all around the world in hopes to also pursue a career in the sciences. She was one of the few women who were early members of the geological profession. Because of this, all of her research and findings creates a precedence for the scientific and mathematical potential for all woman. Not only was Fanny a pioneer in her field, she was also a mother and a wife. Sending a message of women's capabilities to work while supporting and caring for a family. And even after the divorce, she was able to maintain her career while solely caring for her child.\n\n== Contribution to geology ==\nEdson's work was predominantly in the field of petroleum geology. Among her many contributions to her field she established a field laboratory facility in Tulsa, Oklahoma that examined well samples of subsurface sediments and devised methods of strati-graphic correlation and other practical applications of her findings. Her laboratory work was supplemented by field examination of outcrop sections in Oklahoma, and by participation in the wide-ranging field conferences through the Arbuckle and the Ozark mountains, the Missouri and the Mississippi river valleys, and along the Rocky Mountain front. Edson's work with the well samples and the strati-graphic sequences guided her company's understanding of the subsurface Ordovician stratigraphy. Further, her determinations and mapping of the subsurface pre-Mississippian rocks yielded for her company an accurate outline of the newly recognized Central Kansas uplift.\n\n== Personal life ==\nFanny Carter Edson was married to Frank Aaron Edson, whose work in iron-ore exploration made them travel to Minnesota. The Edson's moved in 1917 to Duluth, Minnesota. They then had their daughter in June. While the United States had entered the First World War, the duties of Fanny's husband with the Y.M.C.A. Field Service took him to various army training camps, while Fanny remained in Duluth. For three years she filled various clerical positions, and taught general science for one semester in public schools. Fanny and her daughter joined her husband in 1921 at Norman, Oklahoma, where he was employed on the Oklahoma Geological Survey. She continued and furthered her studies there for a few years. Now versed in geology, and with special training and experience in pre-Cambrian stratigraphy and structure, North American Mid-Continent geology, mineralogy and petrography, and phases of subsurface exploration, Fanny Carter Edson accepted employment with the Roxana Petroleum Corporation (now part of the Shell Oil Company) in September, 1924, at Tulsa, Oklahoma. There, she became solely responsible for the personal rearing of her daughter when she and her husband divorced in 1923. There she began the application of her science and her most rigorous studies to the vocation in which she was enthralled for the remainder of her life.\n\n== Achievements ==\nNearing the end of her career, Edson was employed at the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] (1942-1945). In addition to her fellowship at the Geological Society of American she was also a prominent member of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists and the Stratigraphic Society of Tulsa, Oklahoma.<ref name=\"American Women 1940.
