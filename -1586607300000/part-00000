After sixty years of trying to gain social acceptance women's football was introduced to the college level. In the late 1970s, women's club teams started to appear on college campus, but it wasn't until the 1980s that they started to gain recognition and gained a varsity status. Brown University was the first college to grant full varsity level status to their women's soccer team. The Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) sponsored the first regional women's soccer tournament at college in the US, which was held at [[Brown University]]. The first national level tournament was held at Colorado College, which gained official AIAW sponsorship in 1981. The 1990s saw greater participation mainly due to the [[Title IX]] of 23 June 1972, which increased school's budgets and their addition of women's scholarships.<blockquote>\n\"Currently there are over 700 intercollegiate women's soccer teams playing for many types and sizes of colleges and universities. This includes colleges and universities that are members of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), and the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA).\"\n</blockquote>\n\n== Attire ==\nThe majority of women footballers around the globe wear a traditional [[Kit (association football)|kit]] made up of a jersey, shorts, cleats and knee-length socks worn over [[shin guards]].\n\n=== Controversies ===\nIn 2004, FIFA President [[Sepp Blatter]] suggested that women footballers should \"wear tighter shorts and low cut shirts... to create a more female aesthetic\" and attract more male fans.

After sixty years of trying to gain social acceptance women's football was introduced to the college level. In the late 1970s, women's club teams started to appear on college campus, but it wasn't until the 1980s that they started to gain recognition and gained a varsity status. Brown University was the first college to grant full varsity level status to their women's soccer team. The Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) sponsored the first regional women's soccer tournament at college in the US, which was held at [[Brown University]]. The first national level tournament was held at Colorado College, which gained official AIAW sponsorship in 1981. The 1990s saw greater participation mainly due to the [[Title IX]] of 23 June 1972, which increased school's budgets and their addition of women's scholarships.<blockquote>\n\"Currently there are over 700 intercollegiate women's soccer teams playing for many types and sizes of colleges and universities. This includes colleges and universities that are members of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), and the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA).\"\n</blockquote>\n\n== Attire ==\nThe majority of women footballers around the globe wear a traditional [[Kit (association football)|kit]] made up of a jersey, shorts, cleats and knee-length socks worn over [[shin guards]].\n\n=== Controversies ===\nIn 2004, FIFA President [[Sepp Blatter]] suggested that women footballers should \"wear tighter shorts and low cut shirts... to create a more female aesthetic\" and attract more male fans.

Denying that the kit change was merely a publicity stunt, club chairman Jan van den Elzen told [[Reuters]]:\n\n{{quote|''The girls asked us if they could make a team and asked specifically to play in skirts.

The band signed to [[Epic Records]] in 1991. A few months after the completion of the band's debut studio album, ''[[Ten (Pearl Jam album)|Ten]]'', drummer [[Dave Abbruzzese]] joined the band. ''Ten'' broke Pearl Jam into the mainstream, and became one of the best-selling alternative albums of the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=tblTop100 |title=Top 100 Albums |publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]] |accessdate=July 25, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mqv3Gpco?url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=tblTop100 |archivedate=January 17, 2010}}</ref> Following an intense touring schedule, the band went into the studio to record what would become its second studio album, ''[[Vs.

Burdened by the pressures of success, Pearl Jam decided to decrease the level of promotion for its albums, including refusing to release music videos.<ref>Ashare, Matt. \"The Sweet Smell of (Moderate) Success\". ''[[CMJ New Music Monthly]]'' July 2000.</ref> In 1994, the band released its third studio album, ''[[Vitalogy]]'', which became the band's third straight album to reach multi-platinum status.\n\nFollowing Abbruzzese's exit in 1994, original [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] drummer [[Jack Irons]] joined the band. Pearl Jam subsequently released ''[[No Code]]'' in 1996 and ''[[Yield (album)|Yield]]'' in 1998. The band once again changed drummers in 1998, with Irons being replaced by former Soundgarden drummer [[Matt Cameron]], who had previously worked with the members of Pearl Jam in the Temple of the Dog project and had drummed on the band's first demos. Cameron has remained as Pearl Jam's drummer ever since. In 1998, Pearl Jam released \"[[Last Kiss]]\" on the band's fan club Christmas single; however, by popular demand, the cover was released to the public as a single in 1999. \"Last Kiss\" became the band's highest-charting single, peaking at number two on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. In 2000, Pearl Jam released its sixth studio album, ''[[Binaural (album)|Binaural]]'', and initiated a series of \"[[Pearl Jam Official Bootlegs|official bootlegs]]\" of live albums. The band released seventy-two such live albums in 2000 and 2001, and set a record for most albums to debut in the ''Billboard'' 200 at the same time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/pearl-jam/news/artist-name-pearl-jam-id-1020778-breaks-its-own-chart-record--12055527 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120629092938/http://music.yahoo.com/pearl-jam/news/artist-name-pearl-jam-id-1020778-breaks-its-own-chart-record--12055527 |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 29, 2012 |title=Pearl Jam Breaks Its Own Chart Record |accessdate=July 28, 2009 |author=Davis, Darren |publisher=[[Yahoo!|Yahoo!

Although home life was relatively cold, Larkin enjoyed support from his parents. For example, his deep passion for [[jazz]] was supported by the purchase of a drum kit and a [[saxophone]], supplemented by a subscription to ''[[Down Beat]]''. From the junior school he progressed to King Henry VIII Senior School. He fared quite poorly when he sat his [[School Certificate (UK)|School Certificate]] exam at the age of 16.

By June 1946, Larkin was halfway through qualifying for membership of the [[Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals|Library Association]] and was appointed assistant librarian at [[University College, Leicester]]. It was visiting Larkin in Leicester and witnessing the university's [[Common room (university)|Senior Common Room]] that gave Kingsley Amis the inspiration to write ''[[Lucky Jim]]'' (1954), the novel that made Amis famous and to whose long gestation Larkin contributed considerably.<ref name=\"Motion 1993, p. 238\">Motion 1993, p. 238.</ref> Six weeks after his father's death from cancer in March 1948, Larkin proposed to Ruth, and that summer the couple spent their annual holiday touring [[Thomas Hardy's Wessex|Hardy country]].<ref name=\"bradford70\">Bradford 2005, p. 70.</ref>\n\nIn June 1950 Larkin was appointed sub-librarian at [[The Queen's University of Belfast]], a post he took up that September.

At some stage between the appointment to the position at Queen's and the end of the engagement to Ruth, Larkin's friendship with [[Relationships that influenced Philip Larkin#Monica Jones|Monica Jones]], a lecturer in English at Leicester, also developed into a sexual relationship. He spent five years in Belfast, which appear to have been the most contented of his life.

From 1951 onwards Larkin holidayed with Jones in various locations around the British Isles. While in Belfast he also had a significant though sexually undeveloped friendship with [[Winifred Arnott]], the subject of \"Lines on a Young Lady's Photograph Album\", which came to an end when she married in 1954. This was the period in which he gave Kingsley Amis extensive advice on the writing of ''Lucky Jim''.<ref name=\"Motion 1993, p. 238\"/> Amis repaid the debt by dedicating the finished book to Larkin.<ref>Hartley 1989, p. 7.</ref>\n\n[[File:Philip Larkin -Flat in Hull 1.jpg|upright|right|thumb|This second-floor flat overlooking Pearson Park in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] was Larkin's rented accommodation from 1956 to 1974 (photo&nbsp;2008).|alt=Larkin's former second-floor flat in Hull was part of a building of conventional red-brick construction in a residential area.]]\nIn 1955 Larkin became University Librarian at the [[University of Hull]], a post he held until his death.<ref>Motion 1993, pp. 244\u2013245</ref> [[Raymond L.

When Larkin took up his appointment there, the plans for a new university library were already far advanced. He made a great effort in just a few months to familiarize himself with them before they were placed before the [[University Grants Committee (United Kingdom)|University Grants Committee]]; he suggested a number of emendations, some major and structural, all of which were adopted. It was built in two stages, and in 1967 it was named the [[Brynmor Jones Library]] after Sir [[Brynmor Jones (academic)|Brynmor Jones]], the university's [[Chancellor (education)|vice-chancellor]].\n\nOne of Larkin's colleagues at Hull said he became a great figure in post-war British librarianship.<ref>Goodman 1997, p. 4.</ref> Ten years after the new library's completion, Larkin computerized records for the entire library stock, making it the first library in Europe to install a [[Geac Computer Corporation|GEAC]] system, an automated online circulation system.

Soon after the completion of the second and larger phase of construction in 1969,<ref>Bradford 2005, p. 217.</ref> he was able to redirect his energies. In October 1970 he started work on compiling a new anthology, <!-- if changing the title of this book, please provide a citation -->''[[The Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse]]'' (1973). He was awarded a Visiting Fellowship at [[All Souls College, Oxford]], for two academic terms, allowing him to consult Oxford's [[Bodleian Library]], a [[copyright library]]. While he was in Oxford he passed responsibility for the Library to his deputy, [[Brenda Moon]]. Larkin was a major contributor to the re-evaluation of the poetry of [[Thomas Hardy]], which, in comparison to his novels, had been overlooked; in Larkin's \"idiosyncratic\" and \"controversial\" anthology,<ref>Motion 1993, p. 407.</ref><ref name=\"Motion 1993, p. 431\">Motion 1993, p. 431.</ref> Hardy was the poet most generously represented. There were twenty-seven poems by Hardy, compared with only nine by [[T. S. Eliot]] (however, Eliot is most famous for long poems); the other poets most extensively represented were [[William Butler Yeats|W. B. Yeats]], [[W. H. Auden]] and [[Rudyard Kipling]]. Larkin included six of his own poems\u2014the same number as for [[Rupert Brooke]]. In the process of compiling the volume he had been disappointed not to find more and better poems as evidence that the clamour over the [[Modernists]] had stifled the voices of traditionalists.<ref name=\"Motion 1993, p. 431\" /> The most favourable responses to the anthology were those of Auden and John Betjeman, while the most hostile was that of [[Donald Davie]], who accused Larkin of \"positive cynicism\" and of encouraging \"the perverse triumph of philistinism, the cult of the amateur ... [and] the weakest kind of Englishry\". After an initial period of anxiety about the anthology's reception, Larkin enjoyed the clamour.<ref>Bowen 2008, p. 107.</ref>\n\n[[File:Philip Larkin -house in Hull 1.jpg|right|thumb|105 Newland Park, [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], was Larkin's home from 1974 to his death in 1985 (photo 2008).|alt=Larkin lived in a comfortable residential area in Hull at No.105, [[Newland Park]] in a detached house of red brick construction.

In January 1974 Hull University informed Larkin that they were going to dispose of the building on Pearson Park in which he lived. Shortly afterwards he bought a detached two-storey 1950s house in [[Newland Park]] which was described by his university colleague John Kenyon as \"an entirely middle-class backwater\". Larkin, who moved into the house in June, thought the four-bedroom property \"utterly undistinguished\" and reflected, \"I can't say it's the kind of dwelling that is eloquent of the nobility of the human spirit\".<ref>Motion 1993, p. 440.</ref>\n\nShortly after splitting up with Maeve Brennan in August 1973, Larkin attended W.

This resulted in the publication, three months before ''Jill'', of ''[[The North Ship]]'' (1945), a collection of poems written between 1942 and 1944 which showed the increasing influence of [[William Butler Yeats|Yeats]]. Immediately after completing ''Jill'', Larkin started work on the novel ''A Girl in Winter'' (1947), completing it in 1945. This was published by [[Faber and Faber]] and was well received, ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' calling it \"an exquisite performance and nearly faultless\".<ref>Bradford 2005, p. 77.</ref> Subsequently, he made at least three concerted attempts at writing a third novel, but none went further than a solid start.<ref>Bradford 2005, p. 75.</ref>\n\n===Mature works===\n[[File:William Butler Yeat by George Charles Beresford.jpg|upright|right|thumb|[[William Butler Yeats]], whose poetry was an influence on Larkin in the mid-1940s|alt=A posed black and white photograph of Yeats.

This period also saw Larkin make his final attempts at writing prose fiction, and he gave extensive help to Kingsley Amis with ''[[Lucky Jim]]'', which was Amis's first published novel. In October 1954 an article in ''[[The Spectator]]'' made the first use of the title [[The Movement (literature)|The Movement]] to describe the dominant trend in British post-war literature.<ref>Motion 1993, p. 242.</ref> Various poems by Larkin were included in a 1953 [[International PEN|PEN]] Anthology that also included poems by Amis and [[Robert Conquest]], and Larkin was seen to be a part of this grouping.<ref>Motion 1993, p. 243.</ref> In 1951 Larkin compiled a collection called ''XX Poems'' which he had privately printed in a run of just 100 copies.

During his first five years in Hull the pressures of work slowed Larkin's output to an average of just two-and-a-half poems a year, but this period saw the writing of some of his best-known poems, such as \"[[An Arundel Tomb]]\", \"[[The Whitsun Weddings]]\" and \"Here\".<ref>{{cite book\n |first= Philip\n |last=Larkin\n |title=Collected Poems\n |year=1988\n |pages= 110\u201311, 114\u20135, 136\u20137}}\n</ref>\n\nIn 1963 Faber and Faber reissued ''Jill'', with the addition of a long introduction by Larkin that included much information about his time at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] and his friendship with Kingsley Amis. This acted as a prelude to the release the following year of ''[[The Whitsun Weddings]]'', the volume which cemented his reputation; almost immediately after its publication he was granted a Fellowship of the [[Royal Society of Literature]]. In the years that followed Larkin wrote several of his most famous poems, followed in the 1970s by a series of longer and more sober poems, including \"The Building\" and \"The Old Fools\".<ref>{{cite book\n |first= Philip\n |last=Larkin\n |title=Collected Poems\n |year=1988\n |pages= 191\u20133, 196\u20137, 208\u20139}}\n</ref> All of these appeared in Larkin's final collection, ''[[High Windows]]'', which was published in June 1974. Its more direct use of language meant that it did not meet with uniform praise; nonetheless it sold over twenty thousand copies in its first year alone. For some critics it represents a falling-off from his previous two books,<ref>Swarbrick 1995, pp. 122\u201323.</ref> yet it contains a number of his much-loved pieces, including \"[[This Be The Verse]]\" and \"The Explosion\", as well as the [[High Windows (poem)|title poem]]. \"Annus Mirabilis\" (Year of Wonder), also from that volume, contains the frequently quoted observation that sexual intercourse began in 1963, which the narrator claims was \"rather late for me\": this despite Larkin having started his own sexual career in 1945. Bradford, prompted by comments in Maeve Brennan's memoir, suggests that the poem commemorates Larkin's relationship with Brennan moving from the romantic to the sexual.<ref>Bradford 2005, p. 212.</ref>\n\nLater in 1974 he started work on his final major published poem, \"Aubade\".

In Hawkes's view, \"Larkin's poetry ... revolves around two losses\": the \"loss of modernism\", which manifests itself as \"the desire to find a moment of epiphany\", and \"the loss of England, or rather the loss of the British Empire, which requires England to define itself in its own terms when previously it could define 'Englishness' in opposition to something else.\"<ref>Hawkes 1995, p. 285.</ref>\n\nIn 1972 Larkin wrote the oft-quoted \"Going, Going\", a poem which expresses a romantic [[fatalism]] in its view of England that was typical of his later years. In it he prophesies a complete destruction of the countryside, and expresses an idealised sense of national togetherness and identity: \"And that will be England gone&nbsp;... it will linger on in galleries; but all that remains for us will be concrete and tyres\". The poem ends with the blunt statement, \"I just think it will happen, soon.\"<ref>{{cite book\n |first=Philip\n |last=Larkin\n |title=Collected Poems\n |year=1988\n |page=190}}\n</ref>\n\nLarkin's style is bound up with his recurring themes and subjects, which include death and fatalism, as in his final major poem \"Aubade\".<ref>Motion 1993, pp. 468\u20139.</ref> Poet [[Andrew Motion]] observes of Larkin's poems that \"their rage or contempt is always checked by the ... energy of their language and the satisfactions of their articulate formal control\", and contrasts two aspects of his poetic personality\u2014on the one hand an enthusiasm for \"symbolist moments\" and \"freely imaginative narratives\", and on the other a \"remorseless factuality\" and \"crudity of language\". Motion defines this as a \"life-enhancing struggle between opposites\", and concludes that his poetry is typically \"ambivalent\": \"His three mature collections have developed attitudes and styles of ... imaginative daring: in their prolonged debates with despair, they testify to wide sympathies, contain passages of frequently transcendent beauty, and demonstrate a poetic inclusiveness which is of immense consequence for his literary heirs.\"<ref>{{cite book\n |first=Andrew\n |last=Motion\n |title= Philip Larkin and Symbolism\n |editor-first=Stephen\n |editor-last=Regan\n |year=1997\n |pages= 32, 49\u201350, 52\u201353\n |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]\n |isbn=978-0-333-60483-0}}\n</ref>\n\n===Prose non-fiction===\nLarkin was a notable critic of [[modernism]] in contemporary art and literature.

Praise outweighed criticism; John Betjeman felt Larkin had \"closed the gap between poetry and the public which the experiments and obscurity of the last fifty years have done so much to widen.\" In ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' [[Christopher Ricks]] wrote of the \"refinement of self-consciousness, usually flawless in its execution\" and Larkin's summoning up of \"the world of all of us, the place where, in the end, we find our happiness, or not at all.\" He felt Larkin to be \"the best poet England now has.\"<ref>Motion 1993, p. 343.</ref><ref>Bradford 2005, p.  202.</ref>\n\nIn his biography Richard Bradford writes that the reviews for ''High Windows'' showed \"genuine admiration\" but notes that they typically encountered problems describing \"the individual genius at work\" in poems such as \"Annus Mirabilis\", \"The Explosion\" and \"The Building\" while also explaining why each were \"so radically different\" from one another.

Cooper argues that \"The interplay of signs and motifs in the early work orchestrates a subversion of conventional attitudes towards class, gender, authority and sexual relations\".<ref>Cooper 2004, p. 1.</ref> Cooper identifies Larkin as a progressive writer, and perceives in the letters a \"plea for alternative constructs of masculinity, femininity and social and political organisation\".<ref>Cooper 2004, p. 2.</ref> Cooper draws on the entire canon of Larkin's works, as well as on unpublished correspondence, to counter the image of Larkin as merely a racist, misogynist reactionary. Instead he identifies in Larkin what he calls a \"subversive imagination\".<ref>Cooper 2004, p. 3.</ref> He highlights in particular \"Larkin's objections to the hypocrisies of conventional sexual politics that hamper the lives of both sexes in equal measure\".<ref>Cooper 2004, p. 179.</ref>\n\nIn similar vein to Cooper, Stephen Regan notes in an essay entitled \"Philip Larkin: a late modern poet\" that Larkin frequently embraces devices associated with the experimental practices of [[Modernism]], such as \"linguistic strangeness, self-conscious literariness, radical self-questioning, sudden shifts of voice and register, complex viewpoints and perspectives, and symbolist intensity\".<ref>Corcoran 2007, p. 149.</ref>\n\nA further indication of a new direction in the critical valuation of Larkin is S. K. Chatterjee's statement that \"Larkin is no longer just a name but an institution, a modern British national cultural monument\".<ref>Chatterjee 2007, p. 4.</ref>\n\nChatterjee's view of Larkin is grounded in a detailed analysis of his poetic style. He notes a development from Larkin's early works to his later ones, which sees his style change from \"verbal opulence through a recognition of the self-ironising and self-negating potentiality of language to a linguistic domain where the conventionally held conceptual incompatibles \u2013 which are traditional binary oppositions between absolutes and relatives, between abstracts and concretes, between fallings and risings and between singleness and multiplicity \u2013 are found to be the last stumbling-block for an artist aspiring to rise above the impasse of worldliness\".<ref>Chatterjee 2007, p. 331.</ref> This contrasts with an older view that Larkin's style barely changed over the course of his poetic career. Chatterjee identifies this view as being typified by [[Bernard Bergonzi]]'s comment that \"Larkin's poetry did not ... develop between 1955 and 1974\".<ref>Chatterjee 2007, p. 14.</ref> For Chatterjee, Larkin's poetry responds strongly to changing \"economic, socio-political, literary and cultural factors\".<ref>Chatterjee 2007, p. 18.</ref>\n\n[[File:King Edward Street Kingston upon Hull in 1963 (2) - geograph.org.uk - 678599.jpg|right|thumb|S. K. Chatterjee talks of Larkin's responsiveness to economic, socio-political and cultural factors. In \"Here\" Larkin writes of \"residents from raw estates, brought down / The dead straight miles by stealing flat-faced [[Trolleybuses in Kingston upon Hull|trolleys]]\".|alt=Trolley buses on Hull's King Edward Street in 1963, two years after Larkin finished \"Here\"]]\nChatterjee argues that \"It is under the defeatist veneer of his poetry that the positive side of Larkin's vision of life is hidden\".<ref>Chatterjee 2007, p. 356.</ref> This positivity, suggests Chatterjee, is most apparent in his later works. Over the course of Larkin's poetic career, \"The most notable attitudinal development lay in the zone of his view of life, which from being almost irredeemably bleak and pessimistic in ''The North Ship'', became more and more positive with the passage of time\".<ref>Chatterjee 2007, p. 19.</ref>\n\nThe view that Larkin is not a [[nihilism|nihilist]] or [[pessimist]], but actually displays optimism in his works, is certainly not universally endorsed, but Chatterjee's lengthy study suggests the degree to which old stereotypes of Larkin are now being transcended. Representative of these stereotypes is [[Bryan Appleyard]]'s judgement (quoted by Maeve Brennan) that of the writers who \"have adopted a personal pose of extreme pessimism and loathing of the world ... none has done so with quite such a grinding focus on littleness and triviality as Larkin the man\".<ref name=\"brennan109\">Brennan 2002, p. 109.</ref> Recent criticism of Larkin demonstrates a more complex set of values at work in his poetry and across the totality of his writings.<ref>Ingelbien 2002, p. 13.</ref>\n\nThe debate about Larkin is summed up by Matthew Johnson, who observes that in most evaluations of Larkin \"one is not really discussing the man, but actually reading a coded and implicit discussion of the supposed values of 'Englishness' that he is held to represent\".<ref>Johnson 2007, p. 66.</ref> Changing attitudes to Englishness are reflected in changing attitudes to Larkin, and the more sustained intellectual interest in the English national character, as embodied in the works of [[Peter Mandler]] for instance, pinpoint one key reason why there is an increased scholarly interest in Larkin.<ref>Ingelbien 2002, p. 196.</ref>\n\nA summative view similar to those of Johnson and Regan is that of Robert Crawford, who argues that \"In various ways, Larkin's work depends on, and develops from, Modernism.\" Furthermore, he \"demonstrates just how slippery the word 'English' is\".<ref>Crawford 2000, p. 276.</ref>\n\nDespite these recent developments, Larkin and his circle are nonetheless still firmly rejected by modernist critics and poets.

He contributed to ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' as its [[jazz]] critic from 1961 to 1971, articles gathered in ''All What Jazz: A Record Diary 1961\u201371'' (1985), and he edited ''[[The Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse]]'' (1973).<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/330650/Philip-Larkin Philip Arthur Larkin] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527055723/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/330650/Philip-Larkin |date=27 May 2009 }}, ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''.

It was during the thirty years he worked with distinction as university librarian at the [[Brynmor Jones Library]] at the [[University of Hull]] that he produced the greater part of his published work. His poems are marked by what [[Andrew Motion]] calls \"a very English, glum accuracy\u201d about emotions, places, and relationships, and what [[Donald Davie]] described as \"lowered sights and diminished expectations\".

Although home life was relatively cold, Larkin enjoyed support from his parents. For example, his deep passion for [[jazz]] was supported by the purchase of a drum kit and a [[saxophone]], supplemented by a subscription to ''[[Down Beat]]''. From the junior school he progressed to King Henry VIII Senior School. He fared quite poorly when he sat his [[School Certificate (UK)|School Certificate]] exam at the age of 16. Despite his results, he was allowed to stay on at school; two years later he earned distinctions in English and History, and passed the entrance exams for [[St John's College, Oxford]], to read English.<ref>Bradford 2005, p. 38.</ref>\n\nLarkin began at Oxford University in October 1940, a year after the outbreak of [[Second World War]].

By June 1946, Larkin was halfway through qualifying for membership of the [[Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals|Library Association]] and was appointed assistant librarian at [[University College, Leicester]]. It was visiting Larkin in Leicester and witnessing the university's [[Common room (university)|Senior Common Room]] that gave Kingsley Amis the inspiration to write ''[[Lucky Jim]]'' (1954), the novel that made Amis famous and to whose long gestation Larkin contributed considerably.<ref name=\"Motion 1993, p. 238\">Motion 1993, p. 238.</ref> Six weeks after his father's death from cancer in March 1948, Larkin proposed to Ruth, and that summer the couple spent their annual holiday touring [[Thomas Hardy's Wessex|Hardy country]].<ref name=\"bradford70\">Bradford 2005, p. 70.</ref>\n\nIn June 1950 Larkin was appointed sub-librarian at [[The Queen's University of Belfast]], a post he took up that September.

At some stage between the appointment to the position at Queen's and the end of the engagement to Ruth, Larkin's friendship with [[Relationships that influenced Philip Larkin#Monica Jones|Monica Jones]], a lecturer in English at Leicester, also developed into a sexual relationship.

Soon after the completion of the second and larger phase of construction in 1969,<ref>Bradford 2005, p. 217.</ref> he was able to redirect his energies. In October 1970 he started work on compiling a new anthology, <!-- if changing the title of this book, please provide a citation -->''[[The Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse]]'' (1973). He was awarded a Visiting Fellowship at [[All Souls College, Oxford]], for two academic terms, allowing him to consult Oxford's [[Bodleian Library]], a [[copyright library]]. While he was in Oxford he passed responsibility for the Library to his deputy, [[Brenda Moon]]. Larkin was a major contributor to the re-evaluation of the poetry of [[Thomas Hardy]], which, in comparison to his novels, had been overlooked; in Larkin's \"idiosyncratic\" and \"controversial\" anthology,<ref>Motion 1993, p. 407.</ref><ref name=\"Motion 1993, p. 431\">Motion 1993, p. 431.</ref> Hardy was the poet most generously represented. There were twenty-seven poems by Hardy, compared with only nine by [[T. S. Eliot]] (however, Eliot is most famous for long poems); the other poets most extensively represented were [[William Butler Yeats|W. B. Yeats]], [[W. H. Auden]] and [[Rudyard Kipling]]. Larkin included six of his own poems\u2014the same number as for [[Rupert Brooke]]. In the process of compiling the volume he had been disappointed not to find more and better poems as evidence that the clamour over the [[Modernists]] had stifled the voices of traditionalists.<ref name=\"Motion 1993, p. 431\" /> The most favourable responses to the anthology were those of Auden and John Betjeman, while the most hostile was that of [[Donald Davie]], who accused Larkin of \"positive cynicism\" and of encouraging \"the perverse triumph of philistinism, the cult of the amateur ... [and] the weakest kind of Englishry\".

In January 1974 Hull University informed Larkin that they were going to dispose of the building on Pearson Park in which he lived. Shortly afterwards he bought a detached two-storey 1950s house in [[Newland Park]] which was described by his university colleague John Kenyon as \"an entirely middle-class backwater\". Larkin, who moved into the house in June, thought the four-bedroom property \"utterly undistinguished\" and reflected, \"I can't say it's the kind of dwelling that is eloquent of the nobility of the human spirit\".<ref>Motion 1993, p. 440.</ref>\n\nShortly after splitting up with Maeve Brennan in August 1973, Larkin attended W.

Around this time he developed a pseudonymous alter ego for his prose, [[Brunette Coleman]]. Under this name he wrote two novellas, ''Trouble at Willow Gables'' and ''Michaelmas Term at St Brides'' (2002), as well as a supposed autobiography and an equally fictitious creative manifesto called \"What we are writing for\". Richard Bradford has written that these curious works show \"three registers: cautious indifference, archly overwritten symbolism with a hint of Lawrence and prose that appears to disclose its writer's involuntary feelings of sexual excitement\".<ref>Bradford 2005, p. 51.</ref>\n\nAfter these works Larkin started his first published novel ''[[Jill (novel)|Jill]]'' (1946).

This resulted in the publication, three months before ''Jill'', of ''[[The North Ship]]'' (1945), a collection of poems written between 1942 and 1944 which showed the increasing influence of [[William Butler Yeats|Yeats]]. Immediately after completing ''Jill'', Larkin started work on the novel ''A Girl in Winter'' (1947), completing it in 1945. This was published by [[Faber and Faber]] and was well received, ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' calling it \"an exquisite performance and nearly faultless\".<ref>Bradford 2005, p. 77.</ref> Subsequently, he made at least three concerted attempts at writing a third novel, but none went further than a solid start.<ref>Bradford 2005, p. 75.</ref>\n\n===Mature works===\n[[File:William Butler Yeat by George Charles Beresford.jpg|upright|right|thumb|[[William Butler Yeats]], whose poetry was an influence on Larkin in the mid-1940s|alt=A posed black and white photograph of Yeats.

This period also saw Larkin make his final attempts at writing prose fiction, and he gave extensive help to Kingsley Amis with ''[[Lucky Jim]]'', which was Amis's first published novel. In October 1954 an article in ''[[The Spectator]]'' made the first use of the title [[The Movement (literature)|The Movement]] to describe the dominant trend in British post-war literature.<ref>Motion 1993, p. 242.</ref> Various poems by Larkin were included in a 1953 [[International PEN|PEN]] Anthology that also included poems by Amis and [[Robert Conquest]], and Larkin was seen to be a part of this grouping.<ref>Motion 1993, p. 243.</ref> In 1951 Larkin compiled a collection called ''XX Poems'' which he had privately printed in a run of just 100 copies.

During his first five years in Hull the pressures of work slowed Larkin's output to an average of just two-and-a-half poems a year, but this period saw the writing of some of his best-known poems, such as \"[[An Arundel Tomb]]\", \"[[The Whitsun Weddings]]\" and \"Here\".<ref>{{cite book\n |first= Philip\n |last=Larkin\n |title=Collected Poems\n |year=1988\n |pages= 110\u201311, 114\u20135, 136\u20137}}\n</ref>\n\nIn 1963 Faber and Faber reissued ''Jill'', with the addition of a long introduction by Larkin that included much information about his time at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] and his friendship with Kingsley Amis. This acted as a prelude to the release the following year of ''[[The Whitsun Weddings]]'', the volume which cemented his reputation; almost immediately after its publication he was granted a Fellowship of the [[Royal Society of Literature]]. In the years that followed Larkin wrote several of his most famous poems, followed in the 1970s by a series of longer and more sober poems, including \"The Building\" and \"The Old Fools\".<ref>{{cite book\n |first= Philip\n |last=Larkin\n |title=Collected Poems\n |year=1988\n |pages= 191\u20133, 196\u20137, 208\u20139}}\n</ref> All of these appeared in Larkin's final collection, ''[[High Windows]]'', which was published in June 1974. Its more direct use of language meant that it did not meet with uniform praise; nonetheless it sold over twenty thousand copies in its first year alone. For some critics it represents a falling-off from his previous two books,<ref>Swarbrick 1995, pp. 122\u201323.</ref> yet it contains a number of his much-loved pieces, including \"[[This Be The Verse]]\" and \"The Explosion\", as well as the [[High Windows (poem)|title poem]]. \"Annus Mirabilis\" (Year of Wonder), also from that volume, contains the frequently quoted observation that sexual intercourse began in 1963, which the narrator claims was \"rather late for me\": this despite Larkin having started his own sexual career in 1945. Bradford, prompted by comments in Maeve Brennan's memoir, suggests that the poem commemorates Larkin's relationship with Brennan moving from the romantic to the sexual.<ref>Bradford 2005, p. 212.</ref>\n\nLater in 1974 he started work on his final major published poem, \"Aubade\".

He has a well-tended handlebar moustache]]\nTerence Hawkes has argued that while most of the poems in ''The North Ship'' are \"metaphoric in nature, heavily indebted to Yeats's symbolist lyrics\", the subsequent development of Larkin's mature style is \"not ... a movement from Yeats to Hardy, but rather a surrounding of the Yeatsian moment (the metaphor) within a Hardyesque frame\". In Hawkes's view, \"Larkin's poetry ... revolves around two losses\": the \"loss of modernism\", which manifests itself as \"the desire to find a moment of epiphany\", and \"the loss of England, or rather the loss of the British Empire, which requires England to define itself in its own terms when previously it could define 'Englishness' in opposition to something else.\"<ref>Hawkes 1995, p. 285.</ref>\n\nIn 1972 Larkin wrote the oft-quoted \"Going, Going\", a poem which expresses a romantic [[fatalism]] in its view of England that was typical of his later years. In it he prophesies a complete destruction of the countryside, and expresses an idealised sense of national togetherness and identity: \"And that will be England gone&nbsp;... it will linger on in galleries; but all that remains for us will be concrete and tyres\". The poem ends with the blunt statement, \"I just think it will happen, soon.\"<ref>{{cite book\n |first=Philip\n |last=Larkin\n |title=Collected Poems\n |year=1988\n |page=190}}\n</ref>\n\nLarkin's style is bound up with his recurring themes and subjects, which include death and fatalism, as in his final major poem \"Aubade\".<ref>Motion 1993, pp. 468\u20139.</ref> Poet [[Andrew Motion]] observes of Larkin's poems that \"their rage or contempt is always checked by the ... energy of their language and the satisfactions of their articulate formal control\", and contrasts two aspects of his poetic personality\u2014on the one hand an enthusiasm for \"symbolist moments\" and \"freely imaginative narratives\", and on the other a \"remorseless factuality\" and \"crudity of language\". Motion defines this as a \"life-enhancing struggle between opposites\", and concludes that his poetry is typically \"ambivalent\": \"His three mature collections have developed attitudes and styles of ... imaginative daring: in their prolonged debates with despair, they testify to wide sympathies, contain passages of frequently transcendent beauty, and demonstrate a poetic inclusiveness which is of immense consequence for his literary heirs.\"<ref>{{cite book\n |first=Andrew\n |last=Motion\n |title= Philip Larkin and Symbolism\n |editor-first=Stephen\n |editor-last=Regan\n |year=1997\n |pages= 32, 49\u201350, 52\u201353\n |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]\n |isbn=978-0-333-60483-0}}\n</ref>\n\n===Prose non-fiction===\nLarkin was a notable critic of [[modernism]] in contemporary art and literature.

An unusual feature of the sculpture is central to Larkin's poem \"An Arundel Tomb\": \"Such plainness of the pre-baroque / Hardly involves the eye, until / It meets his left-hand gauntlet, still / Clasped empty in the other, and / One sees, with a sharp tender shock, / His hand withdrawn, holding her hand\"]]\nWhen ''The Whitsun Weddings'' was released Alvarez continued his attacks in a review in ''[[The Observer]]'', complaining of the \"drab circumspection\" of Larkin's \"commonplace\" subject-matter. Praise outweighed criticism; John Betjeman felt Larkin had \"closed the gap between poetry and the public which the experiments and obscurity of the last fifty years have done so much to widen.\" In ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' [[Christopher Ricks]] wrote of the \"refinement of self-consciousness, usually flawless in its execution\" and Larkin's summoning up of \"the world of all of us, the place where, in the end, we find our happiness, or not at all.\" He felt Larkin to be \"the best poet England now has.\"<ref>Motion 1993, p. 343.</ref><ref>Bradford 2005, p.  202.</ref>\n\nIn his biography Richard Bradford writes that the reviews for ''High Windows'' showed \"genuine admiration\" but notes that they typically encountered problems describing \"the individual genius at work\" in poems such as \"Annus Mirabilis\", \"The Explosion\" and \"The Building\" while also explaining why each were \"so radically different\" from one another.

Cooper argues that \"The interplay of signs and motifs in the early work orchestrates a subversion of conventional attitudes towards class, gender, authority and sexual relations\".<ref>Cooper 2004, p. 1.</ref> Cooper identifies Larkin as a progressive writer, and perceives in the letters a \"plea for alternative constructs of masculinity, femininity and social and political organisation\".<ref>Cooper 2004, p. 2.</ref> Cooper draws on the entire canon of Larkin's works, as well as on unpublished correspondence, to counter the image of Larkin as merely a racist, misogynist reactionary. Instead he identifies in Larkin what he calls a \"subversive imagination\".<ref>Cooper 2004, p. 3.</ref> He highlights in particular \"Larkin's objections to the hypocrisies of conventional sexual politics that hamper the lives of both sexes in equal measure\".<ref>Cooper 2004, p. 179.</ref>\n\nIn similar vein to Cooper, Stephen Regan notes in an essay entitled \"Philip Larkin: a late modern poet\" that Larkin frequently embraces devices associated with the experimental practices of [[Modernism]], such as \"linguistic strangeness, self-conscious literariness, radical self-questioning, sudden shifts of voice and register, complex viewpoints and perspectives, and symbolist intensity\".<ref>Corcoran 2007, p. 149.</ref>\n\nA further indication of a new direction in the critical valuation of Larkin is S. K. Chatterjee's statement that \"Larkin is no longer just a name but an institution, a modern British national cultural monument\".<ref>Chatterjee 2007, p. 4.</ref>\n\nChatterjee's view of Larkin is grounded in a detailed analysis of his poetic style. He notes a development from Larkin's early works to his later ones, which sees his style change from \"verbal opulence through a recognition of the self-ironising and self-negating potentiality of language to a linguistic domain where the conventionally held conceptual incompatibles \u2013 which are traditional binary oppositions between absolutes and relatives, between abstracts and concretes, between fallings and risings and between singleness and multiplicity \u2013 are found to be the last stumbling-block for an artist aspiring to rise above the impasse of worldliness\".<ref>Chatterjee 2007, p. 331.</ref> This contrasts with an older view that Larkin's style barely changed over the course of his poetic career. Chatterjee identifies this view as being typified by [[Bernard Bergonzi]]'s comment that \"Larkin's poetry did not ... develop between 1955 and 1974\".<ref>Chatterjee 2007, p. 14.</ref> For Chatterjee, Larkin's poetry responds strongly to changing \"economic, socio-political, literary and cultural factors\".<ref>Chatterjee 2007, p. 18.</ref>\n\n[[File:King Edward Street Kingston upon Hull in 1963 (2) - geograph.org.uk - 678599.jpg|right|thumb|S. K. Chatterjee talks of Larkin's responsiveness to economic, socio-political and cultural factors. In \"Here\" Larkin writes of \"residents from raw estates, brought down / The dead straight miles by stealing flat-faced [[Trolleybuses in Kingston upon Hull|trolleys]]\".|alt=Trolley buses on Hull's King Edward Street in 1963, two years after Larkin finished \"Here\"]]\nChatterjee argues that \"It is under the defeatist veneer of his poetry that the positive side of Larkin's vision of life is hidden\".<ref>Chatterjee 2007, p. 356.</ref> This positivity, suggests Chatterjee, is most apparent in his later works. Over the course of Larkin's poetic career, \"The most notable attitudinal development lay in the zone of his view of life, which from being almost irredeemably bleak and pessimistic in ''The North Ship'', became more and more positive with the passage of time\".<ref>Chatterjee 2007, p. 19.</ref>\n\nThe view that Larkin is not a [[nihilism|nihilist]] or [[pessimist]], but actually displays optimism in his works, is certainly not universally endorsed, but Chatterjee's lengthy study suggests the degree to which old stereotypes of Larkin are now being transcended. Representative of these stereotypes is [[Bryan Appleyard]]'s judgement (quoted by Maeve Brennan) that of the writers who \"have adopted a personal pose of extreme pessimism and loathing of the world ... none has done so with quite such a grinding focus on littleness and triviality as Larkin the man\".<ref name=\"brennan109\">Brennan 2002, p. 109.</ref> Recent criticism of Larkin demonstrates a more complex set of values at work in his poetry and across the totality of his writings.<ref>Ingelbien 2002, p. 13.</ref>\n\nThe debate about Larkin is summed up by Matthew Johnson, who observes that in most evaluations of Larkin \"one is not really discussing the man, but actually reading a coded and implicit discussion of the supposed values of 'Englishness' that he is held to represent\".<ref>Johnson 2007, p. 66.</ref> Changing attitudes to Englishness are reflected in changing attitudes to Larkin, and the more sustained intellectual interest in the English national character, as embodied in the works of [[Peter Mandler]] for instance, pinpoint one key reason why there is an increased scholarly interest in Larkin.<ref>Ingelbien 2002, p. 196.</ref>\n\nA summative view similar to those of Johnson and Regan is that of Robert Crawford, who argues that \"In various ways, Larkin's work depends on, and develops from, Modernism.\" Furthermore, he \"demonstrates just how slippery the word 'English' is\".<ref>Crawford 2000, p. 276.</ref>\n\nDespite these recent developments, Larkin and his circle are nonetheless still firmly rejected by modernist critics and poets.

His developments received universal recognition and serve as a basis for considerable part of the optical designs used today.\n\n==Biography==\n\nLudwig Jakob Bertele was born 25 December 1900 in [[Munich]], to an architect\u2019s family.\n\nIn 1916 he began to work as an assistant of optics designer in [[Rodenstock GmbH|Rodenstock]] firm in Munich. In 1919 he went to [[Dresden]] to work in {{Interlanguage link multi|Ernemann|de|3=Ernemann|lt=Ernemann Company (Krupp-Ernemann Kinoapparate AG)}}.

He has taken for a basis an optical scheme of cinema lens [[Ultrastigmat]], a modified [[Cooke triplet|triplet]], which was calculated by [[Charles C. Minor]] in 1916 and being produced by [[Gundlach Company]]. The main purpose was the increasing of light-gathering power and diminution of [[Optical aberration|aberration]].\n\nIn 1923, after four years of intensive efforts, he has patented<ref name=\"first\">Patents for lens Ernostar:\n* Great Britain \u2116 191,702,\n* Germany \u2116 401,274,\n* USA \u2116 1,584,271.</ref> his first ultra high-aperture objective Ernostar f/2, its successive versions followed until 1926. That lens was fitted to the [[Ermanox]] camera, which was specially developed for photo [[reportage]]. This was the first camera having sufficient speed and image quality for candid [[photography]] in available light conditions. The pictures of prominent political figures taken with it by [[Erich Salomon]] are widely\nknown.<ref>Rudolf Kingslake. A history of photographic lens. Academic Press {{ISBN|0-12-408640-3}}, San Diego, USA 1989, p. 111</ref>\n\nAfter the foundation of [[Zeiss Ikon]] in 1926, as a result of integration of companies [[ICA AG|ICA (Internationale Camera Actiengesellschaft)]], [[Goerz (company)|Optische Anstalt CP Goerz]], [[Contessa-Nettel]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Ernemann|de|3=Ernemann|lt=Ernemann-Werke}} with [[Carl Zeiss]], Ludwig Bertele continued his work in [[Dresden]] except for a short trip to United States in 1929. An experimental optical workshop was given at the disposal of Bertele. That shop made all examples and prototypes of Bertele's calculations. Every lens got a unique five-cipher number; often a current number of the variant was also engraved.<ref name=\"Hartmut Thiele 2007, p. 34\"/>\n\nIn the late 1920s Bertele began the development of a series of excellent lenses, based generally on the second Ernostar type, which was developed in 1924 (i.e., each lens had a single positive element in front of it followed by a thick negative meniscus-shaped component, with a positive element behind). In 1931, the first example of such lenses appeared. It received the name [[Zeiss Sonnar|Sonnar]].<ref name=\"second\">Patents for lens Sonnar:\n* Great Britain \u2116 383,591,\n* Germany \u2116 570,983,\n* USA \u2116 1,998,704.</ref>\n\nThis lens consisted of seven elements in three groups with a maximum [[aperture]] of f/2. The main difference from his predecessor Ernostar was a lesser number of optical groups and therefore lesser light dispersion and higher [[Display contrast|contrast]]. Those lenses proved extraordinarily successful and got high marks from specialists.\n\nIn 1932 a Sonnar f/1.5 appeared, which was fitted to [[Zeiss Ikon]]'s 35&nbsp;mm [[Contax]] cameras. with Sonnar versions following with [[focal length]]s from 50 to 300&nbsp;mm been developed until 1940.\n\nAround 1934, Bertele, having taken the scheme of Sonnar as a basis, created the first wide-angle lens [[Biogon]] with a 60\u00b0 viewing angle.\n\nIn 1935, Ludwig Bertele calculated the Sonnar 180mm/2.8 on the occasion of the [[1936 Summer Olympics|XI summer Olympic Games]] of 1936 in [[Berlin]] - hence the name \"Olympia Sonnar\". It was a fabulous lens, which made an image of highest quality with beautiful [[bokeh]]. This lens has been appreciated by photographers and collectors up to now.\n\nBetween 1943 and 1945, Ludwig Bertele was working in {{Interlanguage link multi|C. A. Steinheil & S\u00f6hne|de|3=C. A. Steinheil & S\u00f6hne|lt=Steinheil}} firm, situated in [[Munich]] and [[Lustenau]] . That firm worked for German weapons manufacturers, a/o, the German Ministry of aviation.\n\nAs Zeiss in Dresden and Jena had become part of the Soviet Zone of Occupation in 1945, they were required to transfer these designs as well as machinery and staff for training to Russia and the Ukraine, where all Sonnars were produced in vast numbers under the \"Jupiter\" designation, constituting by far the most desirable optical products from behind the Iron Curtain until this day.  The East and West German Zeiss production was tiny by comparison, while Ludwig Bertele, fortunately in absence, had become the most significant optical designer of the former Soviet Union for over four decades.\n\nIn 1946, he moved to Switzerland, where he founded an optical bureau and started to work in Wild Heerbrugg Company (now [[Leica Geosystems]]) in the field of [[photogrammetry]] and geodesic devices. In 1950 he created an aerial 90\u00b0 viewing-angle lens Aviogon, which was free from optical aberrations. [[Distortion]] was less than 10&nbsp;[[\u00b5m]] at any point of the image field, and the [[Optical resolution|resolution]] at F/4.5 was excellent. The new lens quickly replaced the Topogon and Metrogon as the standard lens for aerial photography and photogrammetry. This lens, as well as 120\u00b0 Super Aviogon, which appeared in 1956, won a great number of prizes and merited general recognition.<ref>Rudolf Kingslake. A history of photographic lens. Academic Press {{ISBN|0-12-408640-3}}, San Diego, USA 1989, p. 151</ref>\n\nAt the same time he computed new optical designs for Carl Zeiss in [[Oberkochen]]. Thus, a Biogon with 90\u00b0 viewing-angle appeared in 1954. This new design was the basis of ultra wide-angle lenses, such as Biogon F/4.5 21&nbsp;mm 1954 for [[Contax]]; Biogon F/4.5 38&nbsp;mm 1954 for [[Hasselblad]]; Biogon F/4.5 53&nbsp;mm and Biogon F/4.5 75&nbsp;mm 1955 for [[Linhof]]. [[NASA]] used the Hasselblad Biogon to document [[Project Gemini]] (1965/66) and later the [[Apollo program]] (1968-72).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1086563236|title=Ludwig J.

In 1959, he was awarded the rank of Honorary [[Doctor of Philosophy|Doctor]] of [[ETH Zurich]] and he appraised it greatly.\n\nHaving retired in 1973, Ludwig Bertele continued to work a lot. He received his last [[patent]] in 1976.\n\nIn his last years he lived in the small town [[Wildhaus]] in canton [[Canton of St. Gallen|St. Gallen]] in Switzerland.\n\nHe died on 16 November 1985.\n\n==Interesting facts==\n\n* The name Sonnar is derived from German word \u201cSonne\u201d (Sun).\n* The name Sonnar had been used previously by the Contessa Company for one of their folding cameras and for the [[Tessar|Tessar-type]] lens fitted to it. After Contessa became part of [[Zeiss Ikon]] the name Sonnar became Zeiss\u2019s property.\n* Optical scheme Ernostar, developed by Ludwig Bertele, serves as a basis for lens Canon EF 135mm F/2.0 L, which is very popular among portrait photographers. The Sonnar scheme is also used in the [[SAL-135F18Z|Sony Carl Zeiss Sonnar T* 135/1.8 ZA lens]], which is being produced for [[Sony A-mount]] SLR cameras.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Hartmut Thiele.

It is the cathedral church of the [[Anglican Diocese of Melbourne|Diocese of Melbourne]] and the [[seat]] of the [[Anglican Archbishop of Melbourne|Archbishop of Melbourne]], who is also the [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan archbishop]] of the [[Province of Victoria]] and, since 28 June 2014, the present seat of the [[Anglican Primate of Australia|Primate of Australia]].\n\nThe cathedral was designed by the English [[Gothic Revival]] architect [[William Butterfield]] and completed in 1891, except for the spires which were built to a different design from 1926 to 1932. It is one of Melbourne's major [[Architecture of Melbourne|architectural landmark]]s.\n\n== Location ==\nSt Paul's Cathedral is in a prominent location at the centre of Melbourne, on the eastern corner of [[Swanston Street, Melbourne|Swanston Street]] and [[Flinders Street, Melbourne|Flinders Street]]. It is situated diagonally opposite [[Flinders Street railway station|Flinders Street station]], which was the hub of 19th-century Melbourne and remains an important transport centre.\n\nImmediately to the south of the cathedral, across Flinders Street, is the new public heart of Melbourne, [[Federation Square]]. Continuing south down Swanston Street is [[Princes Bridge, Melbourne|Princes Bridge]], which crosses the [[Yarra River]], leading to [[St Kilda Road, Melbourne|St Kilda Road]]. Thus the cathedral has a dominating position from the southern approaches to the city.\n\nThe location for the cathedral marks the place of the first [[Christianity|Christian]] service held in Melbourne in 1835. Previous buildings on this site include a [[Corn exchange|corn market]] and [[Paul the Apostle|St Paul]]'s [[Parish Church]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Melbourne in 1862 from Princes Bridge.jpg|thumb|left|1862 lithograph of Melbourne from Princes Bridge, showing the first St Paul's Church]]\nSt Paul's Cathedral is built on the site where the first public Christian service in Melbourne was conducted in 1835. The block was then a government reserve far from the centre of town to the west, and used as a corn market. By 1848 the site was then adjacent to the first [[Princes Bridge]] across the Yarra, and the prominent site was granted to the Anglican Church.<ref>{{cite web|title=St Pauls Cathedral|url=http://vhd.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au/places/815|website=Victorian Heritage Database|accessdate=1 January 2018}}</ref> The [[bluestone]] Church of St Paul the Apostle was consecrated in 1852.\n\nNearly 30 years later with the huge growth of the city and Swanston Street becoming a major thoroughfare, the diocese decided to build a grand cathedral on the site to supersede the 1839 [[St James Old Cathedral]] located in the western end of the CBD. The English architect [[William Butterfield]], known for his distinctive interpretation of the [[Gothic revival architecture|Gothic Revival]], was commissioned to design the new cathedral. The foundation stone was laid in 1880 by the [[Governor of Victoria]], [[John Hope, 1st Marquess of Linlithgow|John, Earl of Hopetoun (''later'' Marquess of Linlithgow)]], in the presence of the Rt Revd [[Charles Perry (bishop)|Charles Perry]], [[Anglican Diocese of Melbourne|Bishop of Melbourne]]. On 22 January 1891 the cathedral (without the spires) was consecrated by the Rt Revd Field Flowers Goe, Bishop of Melbourne.[[File:St Paul's Cathedral repair work, 2005.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Repair work on the spires, 2004]]\n\nThe building work was marked by disputes between Butterfield and the church authorities in Melbourne, leading to Butterfield's resignation in 1884. The job was then awarded to a local architect, [[Joseph Reed (architect)|Joseph Reed]], who completed the building generally faithfully to Butterfield's design and who also designed the attached chapter house in matching style in 1889. To fit the block, the cathedral is orientated in line with the central city grid, just off the north-south axis, rather than facing east, the traditional direction.\n\nThe [[pipe organ]] was commissioned from the English builder [[Lewis & Co|T. C. Lewis]], one of the most prominent organ builders of the 19th century.<ref>[http://www.ohta.org.au/doc/articles/Lewis.html Maidment, J. (1991) OHTA News for January (Vol 15, No 1)]</ref>\n\nFor nearly 40 years, without the [[spire]]s, the cathedral presented as a rather solid, horizontal mass. Construction of the spires began in 1926 to a new design by John Barr of [[Sydney]], in a more traditional Gothic Revival style and with different stone from the Sydney area. It was also much taller than Butterfield's original design. The spires reached their full height in 1932<ref>{{cite news|title=Completion of the Moorhouse tower |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/56738343?searchTerm=moorhouse%20tower&searchLimits=|accessdate=2 January 2018|publisher=The Advertiser (Hurstbridge)|date=15 July 1932}}</ref> and on 30 April 1933 a service of thanksgiving was held for their completion.<ref>{{cite web|title=St Pauls Cathedral|url=http://vhd.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au/places/815|website=Victorian Heritage Database|accessdate=1 January 2018}}</ref> Once the central spire, named the Moorhouse Spire, was completed to its full height of 312&nbsp;ft (95m),<ref>{{cite news|title=St. Paul's Catherdral spires. |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/3918059|accessdate=1 January 2018|publisher=The Argus|date=15 Mar 1928}}</ref> St Paul's became the tallest structure in central Melbourne and dominated the city's skyline when viewed from the south.\n\nThe 1960s saw extensive work completed to the exterior of the cathedral and in 1989 the [[pipe organ|organ]] was restored with the help of a major [[National Trust of Australia|National Trust]] appeal. Further major restoration works were completed in 2009 with significant repairs to the spires, the installation of a coloured glass Lantern in the Moorhouse Tower and coloured glass doors and a glass walled airlock at the Great West door.\n\nThe growth of multi-storey buildings in central Melbourne during the later 20th century robbed St Paul's of its claims to height, but with the retail heart height limit of 40m, it has retained its dominance of the immediate area. For about 30 years it was however somewhat dominated by the 16 storey [[Princes Gate Towers|Gas & Fuel buildings]] built along Flinders Street to the east in 1967, but demolished in 1997 to make way for [[Federation Square]].\n\nBy the 1990s the constant traffic vibration in central Melbourne led to concerns about the structural soundness of the cathedral, particularly its spires. A public appeal, led by the then Dean of Melbourne, [[David John Leyburn Richardson|David Richardson]], raised A$18 million to restore the spires and improve the interior of the building. The seven-year restoration project was completed in 2009, under the guidance of Falkinger Andronas Architects and Heritage Consultants (now Andronas Conservation Architecture). The restoration works were undertaken by Cathedral Stone and were acknowledged by the Australian Institute of Architects, the Victorian Chapter Heritage Architecture Award 2009 and the Lachlan Macquarie National Award for Heritage Architecture 2009.\n\nAs part of the work, stone heads of the former [[Dean (Christianity)|dean]] David Richardson and the [[philanthropy|philanthropist]] [[Dame Elisabeth Murdoch]], created by Melbourne [[sculptor]] Smiley Williams and carved by [[stonemason]] Daryl Gilbert, were added to the spires and new ''[[dalle de verre]]'' [[glass art|glass]] was created by Janusz and Magda Kuszbicki for the west doors and the \"Eighth Day\" [[lantern]] in the Moorhouse Tower.\n\nBesides Sunday and weekday [[Eucharist]]s the cathedral \"maintains the English tradition\" of a daily [[choral]] [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evensong]], being the only Australian Anglican cathedral to do so.<ref>[http://www.stpaulscathedral.org.au/uploads/Notes%20and%20News%20August%20September%202012.pdf Notes & News (2012) St Paul's Cathedral] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502074056/http://www.stpaulscathedral.org.au/uploads/Notes%20and%20News%20August%20September%202012.pdf |date=2 May 2014 }}</ref>\n\n== Architecture ==\n[[File:Butterfields st pauls cathedral melbourne design.jpg|thumb|upright|William Butterfield's original design for St Pauls Cathedral]]\n[[File:ac.stpauls1.jpg|thumb|upright|North aspect and spire]]\n\nThe plan of St Paul's is a traditional [[Architecture of cathedrals and great churches#Latin Cross and Greek Cross|Latin cross]], with a long nave, side aisles, short transepts, a tower at the crossing, with choir below, sanctuary and altar beyond, and a pair of towers framing the ceremonial main entrance.\n\nThe interior stonework is a mixture of [[sandstone]] from the [[Barrabool Hills]] and [[Waurn Ponds]] [[limestone]],  with contrasting stripes of Victorian bluestone, giving the cathedral a warm colouring, when most other grand 19th century public buildings are faced in light grey sandstone imported from other states. It is also quite different in appearance to the [[bluestone]] [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic]] of [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne|St Patrick's]] [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] cathedral on the eastern hill of the city. Because the spires are built from Sydney [[sandstone]] and are 40 years newer, they are a different and darker colour than the older parts of the building.\n\nThe interior features rich colours and strident colour contrasts, characteristic of Butterfield's work, compared to the exterior. All the stonework is constructed of the Waurn Ponds limestone with contrasting stripes of the very dark-coloured local bluestone. The [[dado (architecture)|dado]], floor, high altar and [[reredos]] are outstanding examples of [[High Victorian Gothic]] polychromy. The reredos is made from Devonshire marble, alabaster and glittering Venetian glass mosaics. One of the carved figures on the [[pulpit]] is said to be the image of a former Mayor of Melbourne's daughter who died in infancy. The floor is entirely paved with [[encaustic tile]] imported from the English firm of Maw & Co., featuring both patterned layouts and patterns within the tiles, while the dado is created with patterned glazed tiles.\n\nIn Persian tile on the rear wall of the narthex is a replica of an 8-pointed star found in two churches of the [[Anglican Diocese of Iran]], the church of St Simon the Zealot in [[Shiraz]] and St Luke's Church in [[Isfahan]]. There are two [[baptismal font]]s. The round font of Harcourt granite was installed when the cathedral was first built. In 1912 the immersion font was built in memory of [[Field Flowers Goe]], third Bishop of Melbourne.<ref>\"St Paul's Anglican Cathedral Melbourne- a Ten Minute Tour\", St Paul's Anglican Cathedral, 2015.</ref>\n\n== Deans ==\n[[File:St Paul's Cathedral (8502559780).jpg|thumb|<center>Night view</center>]]\n[[File:Interior of st pauls melb.jpg|thumb|<center>Interior from south aisle</center>]]\nThe [[Dean (Christianity)|dean]] of St Paul's Cathedral, who is responsible for its day-to-day running, is formally [[style (manner of address)|styled]] the \"Dean of Melbourne\":\n\n* [[Hussey Macartney|Hussey Burgh Macartney]], 1852\u20131894 (Dean of [[St James Old Cathedral|St James's Cathedral]])\n* [[George Vance|George Oakley Vance]], 1894\u20131910\n* [[Reginald Stephen]], 1910\u20131914 (later [[Bishop of Newcastle (Australia)|Bishop of Newcastle]], 1919)\n* [[Charles Godby|Charles John Godby]], 1914\u20131919\n* [[Stephen Hart (bishop)|John Stephen Hart]], 1919\u20131927 (later [[Bishop of Wangaratta]], 1927)\n* [[George Aickin|George Ellis Aickin]], 1927\u20131932\n* [[Frederick Head|Frederick Waldegrave Head <small>MC</small>]], 1934\u20131941 (concurrently archbishop)\n* [[Henry Langley (Dean of Melbourne)|Henry Thomas Langley]], 1942\u20131947\n* [[Roscoe Wilson|Alfred Roscoe Wilson]], 1947\u20131953\n* [[Stuart Babbage|Stuart Barton Babbage]], 1953\u20131962\n* [[Tom Thomas (priest)|Tom William Thomas]], 1962\u20131984\n* [[James Grant (Australian bishop)|James Alexander Grant]], 1985\u20131999 (formerly a coadjutor bishop)\n* [[David Richardson (priest)|David John Leyburn Richardson <small>OBE</small>]], 1999\u20132008\n* [[Mark Gregory Burton]], 2008-2012 (formerly an assistant bishop in the Diocese of Perth)\n* [[Andreas Loewe]], 2012\u2013present\n\n== Precentors ==\n* George Sutton, 1891-1899\n* Alfred Wheeler, 1899-1908\n* Henry Kelly, 1909-1922\n* Richard Sherwood, 1922-1936\n* Herbert Oliver Hole, 1936-1942\n* Henry Hugh Girvan, 1954-1957\n* Godfrey William Augustus Kirchner, 1957-1961\n* Henry Hugh Girvan, 1961-1964\n* David Arthur Sankey, 1964-1975\n* Andrew Reginald St John, 1975-1978\n* Albert Bayne Macpherson, 1978-1993\n* Kenneth Ian Crawford, 1993-1997\n* Noel Raymond Whale, 1997-2000\n* Anne Wentzel, 2001-2008\n* Rachel Margaret McDougall, 2008-2011\n* [[Margaret Ruth Redpath]] <small>AO</small>, 2012-2013 (acting)\n* Heather Jane Patacca, 2013\u2013present<ref>[http://www.stpaulscathedral.org.au/people/the_cathedral_chapter ''St Paul's Cathedral Chapter'']</ref>\n\n== Music ==\nMusic plays an integral part of worship at St Paul's, and the repertoire of [[Anglican church music]] can be heard during services.

C. Lewis and Co]] of Brixton, England. Over six and half thousand pounds were spent on its construction, shipping and installation before it was played at the cathedral's inaugural [[Church service|service]] in 1891. Various modifications and maintenance works have been carried out since then, culminating in an A$726,000 restoration which was completed in 1990 with the help of a National Trust appeal. In its restored state the organ has four manuals and pedals with 53 stops, all with electro-pneumatic action, and is housed in the cathedral's south transept behind newly stencilled fa\u00e7ade pipes.\n\n=== Choir ===\n[[File:Carol Service at St Paul's (15973610958).jpg|thumb|The choir in procession during a service at St Paul's Cathedral]]\nOriginally formed in 1888 in conjunction with the [[choir]] of All Saints' [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]], the cathedral choir led the procession for the official opening in 1891. The choir sings at Evensong throughout the week and for two of the four Sunday services. The choir is also called upon for special occasions including chapter Evensongs, synod services, state funerals, concerts, carol services and seasonal services.\n\nSince the early 1990s the choir cassocks are of a deep [[Burgundy (color)|burgundy]] colour, matching the stencil design hue on the organ pipes. Originally the choir wore traditional black cassocks and white surplices, but with the introduction of ''An Australian Prayer Book'' in the late 1970s, new cassocks of a green colour approximating that of the new prayer book cover (and coincidentally, that of the visible organ pipework at the time) were introduced and surplices were discontinued. On a visit to the cathedral in 1985 by the then Archbishop of Canterbury, a somewhat astonished [[Robert Runcie]] exclaimed that he had \"never seen a cathedral choir wearing ''green'' robes before\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.chic-cosy.com/australia/melbourne/melbourne_en.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=3 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923202637/http://www.chic-cosy.com/australia/melbourne/melbourne_en.pdf |archive-date=23 September 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> With the restoration of the organ in the early 1990s, [[surplice]]s were restored and [[cassock]]s of a deep burgundy were introduced matching the new stencil design hue on the organ pipes.\n\nUnique to St Paul's Cathedral is the boys choir role of \"Dean's Chorister\" created by David Richardson when Dean of Melbourne. The Dean's Chorister primarily has the role of leading the choir with the \"virge\" or ceremonial mace, a task formerly performed by the head chorister.\n\nIn 2016, the 125th anniversary of the cathedral's consecration, the Girls' Voices of the Cathedral Choir were established and female lay clerks were also permitted to join the choir. The Girls' and Boys' Voices now sing the same number of services per week, and take an equal share in the musical life of the cathedral.\n\n=== Belfry ===\nSt Paul's has a [[ring of bells|ring]] of 12 bells set for [[change ringing]] in the key of [[C\u266f (musical note)|C\u266f]], with an extra bell to allow different subsets of the full number to be rung still to a [[diatonic]] scale. All 13 bells were cast by Mears & Stainbank of [[Whitechapel Bell Foundry]] in 1889.<ref>{{cite web|last=Baldwin|first=John|title=Melbourne Cath Ch of S Paul|url=http://dove.cccbr.org.uk/detail.php?&DoveID=MELBOURNE1|publisher=Dove's Guide for Church Bell Ringers|accessdate=6 April 2014|year=2009}}</ref> The tenor originally weighed 31[[hundredweight|cwt]] but after the whole set was sent to [[Taylor's Bell Foundry]] in 1963 for retuning it now weighs 29cwt.\n\nThe bells were a gift from [[No\u00eblle, Countess of Rothes|Thomas Dyer Edwardes]] and were dedicated and first rung on 15 November 1889 for the departure of the Governor of Victoria, Sir [[Henry Loch, 1st Baron Loch|Henry Loch]] (''later'' Baron Loch).

St Paul's continues to be the choice venue for many state funerals and has played host to those of many [[prime minister]]s, [[premier]]s, [[governor]]s, [[governor-general|governors-general]] and other significant people.\n\n=== Papal visit ===\nOn 28 November 1986, on his arrival in Melbourne, [[Pope John Paul II]] paid a visit to St Paul's Cathedral in recognition of the dialogue between the Anglican and Roman Catholic churches in Melbourne fostered by their respective former archbishops, the Most Reverend Sir [[Frank Woods (bishop)|Frank Woods]] (Anglican) and the Most Reverend Sir [[Frank Little (priest)|Frank Little]] (Roman Catholic).\n\nThe cathedral choir sang \"''Ecce vicit Leo''\" as the [[Pope]] entered the cathedral. After this the Pope prayed for Christian unity and lit a metre-long candle. A memorial chapel (pictured right) commemorates this historic occasion: only the third time in four centuries when a reigning Pope had made an official visit to an Anglican cathedral.\n\n=== Christmas carol service recording ===\nOn 28 November 2007, a [[Christmas Carol|carol]] service called ''Carols from St Paul\u2019s Cathedral Melbourne'' featuring the choir was recorded by the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] and broadcast Australia-wide on [[Christmas Eve]].\n\n== Services ==\n\n=== Sunday ===\n* 8.00 am Holy Communion (1662 Book of Common Prayer)\n* 9.00 am Family-style Eucharist (A Prayer Book for Australia)\n* 10.30 am Choral Eucharist\n* 6.00 pm Choral Evensong\n\n=== Monday  ===\n\n* 12.15 pm Eucharist \n* 5.10 pm Evening Prayer in Simple English\n\n=== Tuesday to Friday ===\n\n* 12.15 pm Eucharist \n* 5.10 pm Choral Evensong (Evening Prayer during school holidays)\n\n=== Saturday  ===\n\n* 10.00 am Mandarin Language Service \n*12.15 pm Eucharist\n\n=== Public holidays ===\n\n* 12.15 pm Eucharist\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Christianity|Australia}}\n* [[List of cathedrals in Australia]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category}}\n* [http://www.stpaulscathedral.org.au St Paul's Cathedral website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050619171653/http://accessibility.com.au/melbourne/sights/st_pauls.htm Disability information]\n* [http://cv.vic.gov.au/stories/built-environment/st-pauls-cathedral/ St Paul's Cathedral, historic images and original architectural plans from the State Library of Victoria] at Culture Victoria\n* [http://www.andronas.com.au Falkinger Andronas Architects, Heritage Consultants]\n* [http://www.melbourne.anglican.com.au/Pages/Anglican-Diocese-of-Melbourne.aspx Anglican Diocese of Melbourne website]\n\n{{Anglican Church in Australia}}\n{{Melbourne landmarks}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2011}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Saint Pauls Cathedral Melbourne}}\n[[Category:Anglican church buildings in Melbourne]]\n[[Category:Anglican cathedrals in Australia]]\n[[Category:Melbourne City Centre]]\n[[Category:Churches completed in 1891]]\n[[Category:19th-century Anglican church buildings]]\n[[Category:Heritage-listed buildings in Melbourne]]\n[[Category:Anglo-Catholic churches in Australia]]\n[[Category:Deans of Melbourne]]\n[[Category:William Butterfield buildings]]\n[[Category:Gothic Revival architecture in Melbourne]]\n[[Category:Gothic Revival church buildings in Australia]]\n[[Category:Sandstone churches in Australia]]\n[[Category:Cathedrals in Victoria (Australia)]]\n[[Category:Anglo-Catholic cathedrals]]\n[[Category:Cathedrals in Melbourne]]\n[[Category:Landmarks in Melbourne]]\n[[Category:1891 establishments in Australia]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Australian English|date=March 2015}}\n{{Infobox church\n| name = St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne\n| fullname = Cathedral Church of Paul the Apostle\n| image = Interior of st pauls melb03.jpg\n| imagesize = \n| imagealt = \n| caption = Interior of St Paul's\n| pushpin map = \n| pushpin label position = \n| pushpin map alt = \n| pushpin mapsize = \n| map caption = \n| coordinates = {{coord|-37.816853|144.967384|region:AU|format=dms|display=title}}\n| osgraw = <!-- TEXT -->\n| osgridref = <!-- {{gbmappingsmall|TEXT}} -->\n| location = [[City of Melbourne]]\n| country = [[Australia]]\n| denomination = [[Anglican Church of Australia]]\n| tradition = \n| membership = \n| website = cathedral.org.au\n| former name = St Paul\u2019s Parish Church (1852-1885)\n| bull date = \n| consecrated date = 22 January 1891\n| people = \n| status = \n| functional status = \n| heritage designation = \n| designated date = \n| architect = [[William Butterfield]]\n| architectural type = \n| style = [[Gothic revival architecture|Gothic Revival]]\n| years built = 1880-91, 1926\n| groundbreaking = \n| completed date = \n| construction cost = \n| closed date = \n| demolished date = \n| capacity = \n| length = \n| length nave = \n| length choir = \n| width = \n| width nave = \n| width transepts = \n| height = \n| height nave = \n| height choir = \n| dome quantity = \n| dome height outer = \n| dome height inner = \n| dome dia outer = \n| dome dia inner = \n| tower quantity = \n| tower height = \n| spire quantity = \n| spire height = \n| archdiocese = \n| metropolis = \n| diocese = [[Anglican Diocese of Melbourne|Melbourne]]\n| diocese start = \n| province = [[Province of Victoria|Victoria]]\n| archbishop = [[Philip Freier]]\n| bishop = \n| dean = [[Andreas Loewe]]\n| precentor = Heather Patacca\n| canonpastor = Christopher Carolane\n| reader = \n| director = Phillip Nicholls\n| organist = Siegfried Franke,<br />Lachlan Redd,<br />Roslyn Carolane\n| logo = \n| logosize = \n| logolink = \n| logoalt = \n}}\n\n'''St Paul's Cathedral''' is an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[cathedral]] in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]].  It is the cathedral church of the [[Anglican Diocese of Melbourne|Diocese of Melbourne]] and the [[seat]] of the [[Anglican Archbishop of Melbourne|Archbishop of Melbourne]], who is also the [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan archbishop]] of the [[Province of Victoria]] and, since 28 June 2014, the present seat of the [[Anglican Primate of Australia|Primate of Australia]].\n\nThe cathedral was designed by the English [[Gothic Revival]] architect [[William Butterfield]] and completed in 1891, except for the spires which were built to a different design from 1926 to 1932. It is one of Melbourne's major [[Architecture of Melbourne|architectural landmark]]s.\n\n== Location ==\nSt Paul's Cathedral is in a prominent location at the centre of Melbourne, on the eastern corner of [[Swanston Street, Melbourne|Swanston Street]] and [[Flinders Street, Melbourne|Flinders Street]]. It is situated diagonally opposite [[Flinders Street railway station|Flinders Street station]], which was the hub of 19th-century Melbourne and remains an important transport centre.\n\nImmediately to the south of the cathedral, across Flinders Street, is the new public heart of Melbourne, [[Federation Square]]. Continuing south down Swanston Street is [[Princes Bridge, Melbourne|Princes Bridge]], which crosses the [[Yarra River]], leading to [[St Kilda Road, Melbourne|St Kilda Road]]. Thus the cathedral has a dominating position from the southern approaches to the city.\n\nThe location for the cathedral marks the place of the first [[Christianity|Christian]] service held in Melbourne in 1835. Previous buildings on this site include a [[Corn exchange|corn market]] and [[Paul the Apostle|St Paul]]'s [[Parish Church]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Melbourne in 1862 from Princes Bridge.jpg|thumb|left|1862 lithograph of Melbourne from Princes Bridge, showing the first St Paul's Church]]\nSt Paul's Cathedral is built on the site where the first public Christian service in Melbourne was conducted in 1835. The block was then a government reserve far from the centre of town to the west, and used as a corn market. By 1848 the site was then adjacent to the first [[Princes Bridge]] across the Yarra, and the prominent site was granted to the Anglican Church.<ref>{{cite web|title=St Pauls Cathedral|url=http://vhd.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au/places/815|website=Victorian Heritage Database|accessdate=1 January 2018}}</ref> The [[bluestone]] Church of St Paul the Apostle was consecrated in 1852.\n\nNearly 30 years later with the huge growth of the city and Swanston Street becoming a major thoroughfare, the diocese decided to build a grand cathedral on the site to supersede the 1839 [[St James Old Cathedral]] located in the western end of the CBD. The English architect [[William Butterfield]], known for his distinctive interpretation of the [[Gothic revival architecture|Gothic Revival]], was commissioned to design the new cathedral. The foundation stone was laid in 1880 by the [[Governor of Victoria]], [[John Hope, 1st Marquess of Linlithgow|John, Earl of Hopetoun (''later'' Marquess of Linlithgow)]], in the presence of the Rt Revd [[Charles Perry (bishop)|Charles Perry]], [[Anglican Diocese of Melbourne|Bishop of Melbourne]]. On 22 January 1891 the cathedral (without the spires) was consecrated by the Rt Revd Field Flowers Goe, Bishop of Melbourne.[[File:St Paul's Cathedral repair work, 2005.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Repair work on the spires, 2004]]\n\nThe building work was marked by disputes between Butterfield and the church authorities in Melbourne, leading to Butterfield's resignation in 1884. The job was then awarded to a local architect, [[Joseph Reed (architect)|Joseph Reed]], who completed the building generally faithfully to Butterfield's design and who also designed the attached chapter house in matching style in 1889. To fit the block, the cathedral is orientated in line with the central city grid, just off the north-south axis, rather than facing east, the traditional direction.\n\nThe [[pipe organ]] was commissioned from the English builder [[Lewis & Co|T. C. Lewis]], one of the most prominent organ builders of the 19th century.<ref>[http://www.ohta.org.au/doc/articles/Lewis.html Maidment, J. (1991) OHTA News for January (Vol 15, No 1)]</ref>\n\nFor nearly 40 years, without the [[spire]]s, the cathedral presented as a rather solid, horizontal mass. Construction of the spires began in 1926 to a new design by John Barr of [[Sydney]], in a more traditional Gothic Revival style and with different stone from the Sydney area. It was also much taller than Butterfield's original design. The spires reached their full height in 1932<ref>{{cite news|title=Completion of the Moorhouse tower |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/56738343?searchTerm=moorhouse%20tower&searchLimits=|accessdate=2 January 2018|publisher=The Advertiser (Hurstbridge)|date=15 July 1932}}</ref> and on 30 April 1933 a service of thanksgiving was held for their completion.<ref>{{cite web|title=St Pauls Cathedral|url=http://vhd.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au/places/815|website=Victorian Heritage Database|accessdate=1 January 2018}}</ref> Once the central spire, named the Moorhouse Spire, was completed to its full height of 312&nbsp;ft (95m),<ref>{{cite news|title=St. Paul's Catherdral spires. |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/3918059|accessdate=1 January 2018|publisher=The Argus|date=15 Mar 1928}}</ref> St Paul's became the tallest structure in central Melbourne and dominated the city's skyline when viewed from the south.\n\nThe 1960s saw extensive work completed to the exterior of the cathedral and in 1989 the [[pipe organ|organ]] was restored with the help of a major [[National Trust of Australia|National Trust]] appeal. Further major restoration works were completed in 2009 with significant repairs to the spires, the installation of a coloured glass Lantern in the Moorhouse Tower and coloured glass doors and a glass walled airlock at the Great West door.\n\nThe growth of multi-storey buildings in central Melbourne during the later 20th century robbed St Paul's of its claims to height, but with the retail heart height limit of 40m, it has retained its dominance of the immediate area. For about 30 years it was however somewhat dominated by the 16 storey [[Princes Gate Towers|Gas & Fuel buildings]] built along Flinders Street to the east in 1967, but demolished in 1997 to make way for [[Federation Square]].\n\nBy the 1990s the constant traffic vibration in central Melbourne led to concerns about the structural soundness of the cathedral, particularly its spires. A public appeal, led by the then Dean of Melbourne, [[David John Leyburn Richardson|David Richardson]], raised A$18 million to restore the spires and improve the interior of the building. The seven-year restoration project was completed in 2009, under the guidance of Falkinger Andronas Architects and Heritage Consultants (now Andronas Conservation Architecture). The restoration works were undertaken by Cathedral Stone and were acknowledged by the Australian Institute of Architects, the Victorian Chapter Heritage Architecture Award 2009 and the Lachlan Macquarie National Award for Heritage Architecture 2009.\n\nAs part of the work, stone heads of the former [[Dean (Christianity)|dean]] David Richardson and the [[philanthropy|philanthropist]] [[Dame Elisabeth Murdoch]], created by Melbourne [[sculptor]] Smiley Williams and carved by [[stonemason]] Daryl Gilbert, were added to the spires and new ''[[dalle de verre]]'' [[glass art|glass]] was created by Janusz and Magda Kuszbicki for the west doors and the \"Eighth Day\" [[lantern]] in the Moorhouse Tower.\n\nBesides Sunday and weekday [[Eucharist]]s the cathedral \"maintains the English tradition\" of a daily [[choral]] [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evensong]], being the only Australian Anglican cathedral to do so.<ref>[http://www.stpaulscathedral.org.au/uploads/Notes%20and%20News%20August%20September%202012.pdf Notes & News (2012) St Paul's Cathedral] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502074056/http://www.stpaulscathedral.org.au/uploads/Notes%20and%20News%20August%20September%202012.pdf |date=2 May 2014 }}</ref>\n\n== Architecture ==\n[[File:Butterfields st pauls cathedral melbourne design.jpg|thumb|upright|William Butterfield's original design for St Pauls Cathedral]]\n[[File:ac.stpauls1.jpg|thumb|upright|North aspect and spire]]\n\nThe plan of St Paul's is a traditional [[Architecture of cathedrals and great churches#Latin Cross and Greek Cross|Latin cross]], with a long nave, side aisles, short transepts, a tower at the crossing, with choir below, sanctuary and altar beyond, and a pair of towers framing the ceremonial main entrance.\n\nThe interior stonework is a mixture of [[sandstone]] from the [[Barrabool Hills]] and [[Waurn Ponds]] [[limestone]],  with contrasting stripes of Victorian bluestone, giving the cathedral a warm colouring, when most other grand 19th century public buildings are faced in light grey sandstone imported from other states. It is also quite different in appearance to the [[bluestone]] [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic]] of [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne|St Patrick's]] [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] cathedral on the eastern hill of the city. Because the spires are built from Sydney [[sandstone]] and are 40 years newer, they are a different and darker colour than the older parts of the building.\n\nThe interior features rich colours and strident colour contrasts, characteristic of Butterfield's work, compared to the exterior. All the stonework is constructed of the Waurn Ponds limestone with contrasting stripes of the very dark-coloured local bluestone. The [[dado (architecture)|dado]], floor, high altar and [[reredos]] are outstanding examples of [[High Victorian Gothic]] polychromy. The reredos is made from Devonshire marble, alabaster and glittering Venetian glass mosaics. One of the carved figures on the [[pulpit]] is said to be the image of a former Mayor of Melbourne's daughter who died in infancy. The floor is entirely paved with [[encaustic tile]] imported from the English firm of Maw & Co., featuring both patterned layouts and patterns within the tiles, while the dado is created with patterned glazed tiles.\n\nIn Persian tile on the rear wall of the narthex is a replica of an 8-pointed star found in two churches of the [[Anglican Diocese of Iran]], the church of St Simon the Zealot in [[Shiraz]] and St Luke's Church in [[Isfahan]]. There are two [[baptismal font]]s. The round font of Harcourt granite was installed when the cathedral was first built. In 1912 the immersion font was built in memory of [[Field Flowers Goe]], third Bishop of Melbourne.<ref>\"St Paul's Anglican Cathedral Melbourne- a Ten Minute Tour\", St Paul's Anglican Cathedral, 2015.</ref>\n\n== Deans ==\n[[File:St Paul's Cathedral (8502559780).jpg|thumb|<center>Night view</center>]]\n[[File:Interior of st pauls melb.jpg|thumb|<center>Interior from south aisle</center>]]\nThe [[Dean (Christianity)|dean]] of St Paul's Cathedral, who is responsible for its day-to-day running, is formally [[style (manner of address)|styled]] the \"Dean of Melbourne\":\n\n* [[Hussey Macartney|Hussey Burgh Macartney]], 1852\u20131894 (Dean of [[St James Old Cathedral|St James's Cathedral]])\n* [[George Vance|George Oakley Vance]], 1894\u20131910\n* [[Reginald Stephen]], 1910\u20131914 (later [[Bishop of Newcastle (Australia)|Bishop of Newcastle]], 1919)\n* [[Charles Godby|Charles John Godby]], 1914\u20131919\n* [[Stephen Hart (bishop)|John Stephen Hart]], 1919\u20131927 (later [[Bishop of Wangaratta]], 1927)\n* [[George Aickin|George Ellis Aickin]], 1927\u20131932\n* [[Frederick Head|Frederick Waldegrave Head <small>MC</small>]], 1934\u20131941 (concurrently archbishop)\n* [[Henry Langley (Dean of Melbourne)|Henry Thomas Langley]], 1942\u20131947\n* [[Roscoe Wilson|Alfred Roscoe Wilson]], 1947\u20131953\n* [[Stuart Babbage|Stuart Barton Babbage]], 1953\u20131962\n* [[Tom Thomas (priest)|Tom William Thomas]], 1962\u20131984\n* [[James Grant (Australian bishop)|James Alexander Grant]], 1985\u20131999 (formerly a coadjutor bishop)\n* [[David Richardson (priest)|David John Leyburn Richardson <small>OBE</small>]], 1999\u20132008\n* [[Mark Gregory Burton]], 2008-2012 (formerly an assistant bishop in the Diocese of Perth)\n* [[Andreas Loewe]], 2012\u2013present\n\n== Precentors ==\n* George Sutton, 1891-1899\n* Alfred Wheeler, 1899-1908\n* Henry Kelly, 1909-1922\n* Richard Sherwood, 1922-1936\n* Herbert Oliver Hole, 1936-1942\n* Henry Hugh Girvan, 1954-1957\n* Godfrey William Augustus Kirchner, 1957-1961\n* Henry Hugh Girvan, 1961-1964\n* David Arthur Sankey, 1964-1975\n* Andrew Reginald St John, 1975-1978\n* Albert Bayne Macpherson, 1978-1993\n* Kenneth Ian Crawford, 1993-1997\n* Noel Raymond Whale, 1997-2000\n* Anne Wentzel, 2001-2008\n* Rachel Margaret McDougall, 2008-2011\n* [[Margaret Ruth Redpath]] <small>AO</small>, 2012-2013 (acting)\n* Heather Jane Patacca, 2013\u2013present<ref>[http://www.stpaulscathedral.org.au/people/the_cathedral_chapter ''St Paul's Cathedral Chapter'']</ref>\n\n== Music ==\nMusic plays an integral part of worship at St Paul's, and the repertoire of [[Anglican church music]] can be heard during services.

C. Lewis and Co]] of Brixton, England. Over six and half thousand pounds were spent on its construction, shipping and installation before it was played at the cathedral's inaugural [[Church service|service]] in 1891. Various modifications and maintenance works have been carried out since then, culminating in an A$726,000 restoration which was completed in 1990 with the help of a National Trust appeal. In its restored state the organ has four manuals and pedals with 53 stops, all with electro-pneumatic action, and is housed in the cathedral's south transept behind newly stencilled fa\u00e7ade pipes.\n\n=== Choir ===\n[[File:Carol Service at St Paul's (15973610958).jpg|thumb|The choir in procession during a service at St Paul's Cathedral]]\nOriginally formed in 1888 in conjunction with the [[choir]] of All Saints' [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]], the cathedral choir led the procession for the official opening in 1891. The choir sings at Evensong throughout the week and for two of the four Sunday services. The choir is also called upon for special occasions including chapter Evensongs, synod services, state funerals, concerts, carol services and seasonal services.\n\nSince the early 1990s the choir cassocks are of a deep [[Burgundy (color)|burgundy]] colour, matching the stencil design hue on the organ pipes. Originally the choir wore traditional black cassocks and white surplices, but with the introduction of ''An Australian Prayer Book'' in the late 1970s, new cassocks of a green colour approximating that of the new prayer book cover (and coincidentally, that of the visible organ pipework at the time) were introduced and surplices were discontinued. On a visit to the cathedral in 1985 by the then Archbishop of Canterbury, a somewhat astonished [[Robert Runcie]] exclaimed that he had \"never seen a cathedral choir wearing ''green'' robes before\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.chic-cosy.com/australia/melbourne/melbourne_en.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=3 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923202637/http://www.chic-cosy.com/australia/melbourne/melbourne_en.pdf |archive-date=23 September 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> With the restoration of the organ in the early 1990s, [[surplice]]s were restored and [[cassock]]s of a deep burgundy were introduced matching the new stencil design hue on the organ pipes.\n\nUnique to St Paul's Cathedral is the boys choir role of \"Dean's Chorister\" created by David Richardson when Dean of Melbourne. The Dean's Chorister primarily has the role of leading the choir with the \"virge\" or ceremonial mace, a task formerly performed by the head chorister.\n\nIn 2016, the 125th anniversary of the cathedral's consecration, the Girls' Voices of the Cathedral Choir were established and female lay clerks were also permitted to join the choir. The Girls' and Boys' Voices now sing the same number of services per week, and take an equal share in the musical life of the cathedral.\n\n=== Belfry ===\nSt Paul's has a [[ring of bells|ring]] of 12 bells set for [[change ringing]] in the key of [[C\u266f (musical note)|C\u266f]], with an extra bell to allow different subsets of the full number to be rung still to a [[diatonic]] scale. All 13 bells were cast by Mears & Stainbank of [[Whitechapel Bell Foundry]] in 1889.<ref>{{cite web|last=Baldwin|first=John|title=Melbourne Cath Ch of S Paul|url=http://dove.cccbr.org.uk/detail.php?&DoveID=MELBOURNE1|publisher=Dove's Guide for Church Bell Ringers|accessdate=6 April 2014|year=2009}}</ref> The tenor originally weighed 31[[hundredweight|cwt]] but after the whole set was sent to [[Taylor's Bell Foundry]] in 1963 for retuning it now weighs 29cwt.\n\nThe bells were a gift from [[No\u00eblle, Countess of Rothes|Thomas Dyer Edwardes]] and were dedicated and first rung on 15 November 1889 for the departure of the Governor of Victoria, Sir [[Henry Loch, 1st Baron Loch|Henry Loch]] (''later'' Baron Loch).

St Paul's continues to be the choice venue for many state funerals and has played host to those of many [[prime minister]]s, [[premier]]s, [[governor]]s, [[governor-general|governors-general]] and other significant people.\n\n=== Papal visit ===\nOn 28 November 1986, on his arrival in Melbourne, [[Pope John Paul II]] paid a visit to St Paul's Cathedral in recognition of the dialogue between the Anglican and Roman Catholic churches in Melbourne fostered by their respective former archbishops, the Most Reverend Sir [[Frank Woods (bishop)|Frank Woods]] (Anglican) and the Most Reverend Sir [[Frank Little (priest)|Frank Little]] (Roman Catholic).\n\nThe cathedral choir sang \"''Ecce vicit Leo''\" as the [[Pope]] entered the cathedral. After this the Pope prayed for Christian unity and lit a metre-long candle. A memorial chapel (pictured right) commemorates this historic occasion: only the third time in four centuries when a reigning Pope had made an official visit to an Anglican cathedral.\n\n=== Christmas carol service recording ===\nOn 28 November 2007, a [[Christmas Carol|carol]] service called ''Carols from St Paul\u2019s Cathedral Melbourne'' featuring the choir was recorded by the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] and broadcast Australia-wide on [[Christmas Eve]].\n\n== Services ==\n\n=== Sunday ===\n* 8.00 am Holy Communion (1662 Book of Common Prayer)\n* 9.00 am Family-style Eucharist (A Prayer Book for Australia)\n* 10.30 am Choral Eucharist\n* 6.00 pm Choral Evensong\n\n=== Monday  ===\n\n* 12.15 pm Eucharist \n* 5.10 pm Evening Prayer in Simple English\n\n=== Tuesday to Friday ===\n\n* 12.15 pm Eucharist \n* 5.10 pm Choral Evensong (Evening Prayer during school holidays)\n\n=== Saturday  ===\n\n* 10.00 am Mandarin Language Service \n*12.15 pm Eucharist\n\n=== Public holidays ===\n\n* 12.15 pm Eucharist\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Christianity|Australia}}\n* [[List of cathedrals in Australia]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category}}\n* [http://www.stpaulscathedral.org.au St Paul's Cathedral website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050619171653/http://accessibility.com.au/melbourne/sights/st_pauls.htm Disability information]\n* [http://cv.vic.gov.au/stories/built-environment/st-pauls-cathedral/ St Paul's Cathedral, historic images and original architectural plans from the State Library of Victoria] at Culture Victoria\n* [http://www.andronas.com.au Falkinger Andronas Architects, Heritage Consultants]\n* [http://www.melbourne.anglican.com.au/Pages/Anglican-Diocese-of-Melbourne.aspx Anglican Diocese of Melbourne website]\n\n{{Anglican Church in Australia}}\n{{Melbourne landmarks}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2011}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Saint Pauls Cathedral Melbourne}}\n[[Category:Anglican church buildings in Melbourne]]\n[[Category:Anglican cathedrals in Australia]]\n[[Category:Melbourne City Centre]]\n[[Category:Churches completed in 1891]]\n[[Category:19th-century Anglican church buildings]]\n[[Category:Heritage-listed buildings in Melbourne]]\n[[Category:Anglo-Catholic churches in Australia]]\n[[Category:Deans of Melbourne]]\n[[Category:William Butterfield buildings]]\n[[Category:Gothic Revival architecture in Melbourne]]\n[[Category:Gothic Revival church buildings in Australia]]\n[[Category:Sandstone buildings in Australia]]\n[[Category:Sandstone churches in Australia]]\n[[Category:Cathedrals in Victoria (Australia)]]\n[[Category:Anglo-Catholic cathedrals]]\n[[Category:Cathedrals in Melbourne]]\n[[Category:Stone churches in Australia]]\n[[Category:Landmarks in Melbourne]]\n", "name_user": "Rangasyd", "label": "safe", "comment": "-Category:Sandstone buildings in Australia; -Category:Stone churches in Australia; +Category:1891 establishments in AustraliausingHotCat= duplicated categories", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul%27s_Cathedral,_Melbourne"}
