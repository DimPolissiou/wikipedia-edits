During the years 1941 to 1953, Iran remained a constitutional monarchy and active [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] with Shah [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] retaining extensive legal executive powers.\n\nIn March 15, 1951, the National Assembly, led by Prime Minister [[Hossein Ala]], unanimously voted to nationalize the oil industry, which at the time was dominated by the [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]] (now [[BP]]). In 1953, the British [[MI6]] and American [[CIA]] orchestrated a coup against [[Mohammed Mossadegh]]'s government. Agents fueled rumors that the republican-minded Mossadegh was planning on abolishing the monarchy and declaring himself President of a new Republic of Iran, leading to a pro-monarchist backlash from the public and leading to a successful result in the coup against the prime minister.\n\nThe Shah, who had gone into exile during the coup, returned to Iran and named General [[Fazlollah Zahedi]] as the new prime minister. Many contemporary sources attribute the coup, or counter [[coup]], entirely to the [[United States|U.S.]] American [[CIA]] ([[CIA]] [[Coup]]) and agents of the British [[MI6]] who are reported to have organized and paid for it.<ref>Kinzer, Stephen, ''All the Shah's Men : An American Coup and the Roots of Middle East Terror'', Stephen Kinzer, John Wiley and Sons, 2003, p.5, 6, 210</ref>   These sources point to many other coups in which the CIA was instrumental, such as those in Congo (1964), Chile (1973), and Algeria (1991). Monarchists, however, argue that the counter-coup was in fact a popular uprising, and that the foreign intelligence agencies' undeniable involvement was peripheral. At least some historians argue the coup could not have taken place without both CIA organizing and Iranian support.<ref>Keddie, Nikki R., Roots of Revolution, Yale University Press, 1981, p.140</ref><ref>Kinzer, Stephen, ''All the Shah's Men : An American Coup and the Roots of Middle East Terror'', Stephen Kinzer, John Wiley and Sons, 2003, p.211</ref>\n\nAfterwards, the era of constitutional monarchy gradually came to an end as the Shah increasingly exercised his executive powers unilaterally, thus leading towards the development of autocracy. By the early 1970s, with most political parties having been banned, Iran had effectively become a one-party state under [[Rastakhiz Party|Rastakhiz]]. [[National Front (Iran)|National Front]] leaders like [[Karim Sanjabi]] and moderate traditional Islamic leaders like [[Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari]] continued to espouse a constitutional monarchy.\n[[File:Mohammad Pahlavi Coronation.jpg|thumb|Imperial family of Iran at the coronation of Shah Mohammad Reza in 1967]]\nUnder increasing international pressure, particularly from President [[Jimmy Carter]] of the United States, the Shah pushed forward major democratic reforms in the late 1970s, designed to gradually restore the constitutional monarchy as it had originally been. However, several uprisings in 1978 and 1979 culminated in the Shah, who had been diagnosed with terminal cancer and had kept the fact secret, to leave the country with his family to seek treatment overseas. Within several days the Shah's government had effectively collapsed and the Second Revolution had begun. The new provisional revolutionary government officially abolished the monarchy and declared Iran to be a republic. The following year, in 1980, the Islamic Republic of Iran was established under the [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leadership]] of [[Ruhollah Khomeini]].\n\nIn the months following the Revolution, former Field Marshal of the Imperial Armed Forces [[Bahram Aryana]] organized a counter-revolution in exile. Based in [[Paris]], [[France]], with other military officials of the Imperial Armed Forces and Prince [[Shahriar Shafiq]], he established [[Iran Liberation Army|Azadegan]], a paramilitary resistance intended to help restore the constitutional monarchy. Fearing a growing counter-revolution, Prince Shahriar was assassinated in Paris in December 1979 by Khomeinist agents, which was a major setback for the monarchist resistance. Despite a number of successful operations which garnered international media attention in 1980 and 1981, the outbreak of war between Iran and [[Iraq]] officially brought any hope for counter-revolution to an end.\n\nIn the 1990s and the decade following 2000, the Shah's reputation has staged something of a revival, with many Iranians looking back on his era as a time when Iran was more prosperous<ref>Molavi, Afshin, ''The Soul of Iran'', Norton (2005), p.74</ref><ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/iran/2004/5-020204.htm Iran Report] 2 February 2004</ref> and the government less oppressive.<ref>Sciolino, Elaine, ''Persian Mirrors,'' Touchstone, (2000), p.239, 244</ref> Journalist [[Afshin Molavi]] reports even members of the uneducated poor - traditionally core supporters of the revolution that overthrew the Shah - making remarks such as 'God bless the Shah's soul, the economy was better then;' and finds that \"books about the former Shah (even censored ones) sell briskly,\" while \"books of the Rightly Guided Path sit idle.\"<ref>Molavi, Afshin, ''The Soul of Iran'', Norton (2005), p.74, 10</ref>\n\n==Monarchist parties==\nMonarchist parties and organizations are strictly prohibited by the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran and monarchists and their sympathizers are subject to imprisonment if discovered.

Rastakhiz and [[Kingdom Assembly of Iran]] specifically calls for the return of the [[Pahlavi dynasty|House of Pahlavi]] to the throne.\n\nThe former Crown Prince of Iran, [[Reza Pahlavi, Crown Prince of Iran|Reza Pahlavi]], himself does not advocate the restoration of his [[dynasty]], instead stating that the matter is for Iranians themselves to decide in a national referendum whether or not to restore the constitutional monarchy with the restoration of the House of Pahlavi.<ref>[http://www.rezapahlavi.com/articles/?english&id=52 Reza Pahlavi's Next Revolution: Successor Story, The New Republic, Franklin Foer, Thursday, January 3rd, 2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221210613/http://www.rezapahlavi.com/articles/?english&id=52 |date=2007-02-21 }}</ref>\n\n==Monarchist political parties==\n* [[Rastakhiz Party|Rastakhiz]]\n* [[Constitutionalist Party of Iran]]\n* [http://www.sarbazan.com/ Sarbazan and Janbakhtegan]\n\n==See also==\n*[[Iranian monarchy]]\n*[[Politics of Iran]]\n*[[Political parties in Iran]]\n*[[Tondar]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://azadeganiran.com/Default.asp Azadegan]\n\n[[Category:Monarchism in Iran| ]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Standard of the Shahanshah of Iran.svg|alt=|thumb|Personal Standard of [[Shah of Iran]] before 1979 Revolution, [[Lion and Sun]] [[Flag of Iran]] with [[Emblem of Iran|Pahlavi Coat of Arms]].

However, monarchists remain active in [[Tehrangeles|Los Angeles]] and maintain links with their organizations and parties in Europe such as [[Iran Liberation Army|Azadegan]], the [[Constitutionalist Party of Iran|Constitutionalist Party]] and [[Rastakhiz Party|Rastakhiz]].\n\nMonarchist groups such as Azadegan and Constitutionalist only advocate for the restoration of the constitutional monarchy, without necessarily endorsing the [[Pahlavi dynasty]] or any other Iranian royal dynasty. Rastakhiz and [[Kingdom Assembly of Iran]] specifically calls for the return of the [[Pahlavi dynasty|House of Pahlavi]] to the throne.\n\nThe former Crown Prince of Iran, [[Reza Pahlavi, Crown Prince of Iran|Reza Pahlavi]], himself does not advocate the restoration of his [[dynasty]], instead stating that the matter is for Iranians themselves to decide in a national referendum whether or not to restore the constitutional monarchy with the restoration of the House of Pahlavi.<ref>[http://www.rezapahlavi.com/articles/?english&id=52 Reza Pahlavi's Next Revolution: Successor Story, The New Republic, Franklin Foer, Thursday, January 3rd, 2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221210613/http://www.rezapahlavi.com/articles/?english&id=52 |date=2007-02-21 }}</ref>\n\n==Monarchist political parties==\n* [[Rastakhiz Party|Rastakhiz]]\n* [[Constitutionalist Party of Iran]]\n* [http://www.sarbazan.com/ Sarbazan and Janbakhtegan]\n\n==See also==\n*[[Iranian monarchy]]\n*[[Politics of Iran]]\n*[[Political parties in Iran]]\n*[[Tondar]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://azadeganiran.com/Default.asp Azadegan]\n\n[[Category:Monarchism in Iran| ]]\n", "name_user": "Santamoya35", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eMonarchist parties)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchism_in_Iran"}

Originally, Springfield was primarily a farming town.\n\nOn December 9, 1687, the settlers began laying the road to Amosland as it was then called. This road is now known as Springfield Road. In 1701 construction began on the Baltimore Pike; the road was formed of sturdy oak planks, some of which still exist under the current Baltimore Pike. 1701 also marked the year that construction began on the first Quaker meeting house. The meeting house burned in 1737 and was rebuilt. The current meeting house that stands in its spot was constructed in 1851.\n\nBy the date of the signing of the [[Declaration of Independence of the United States|Declaration of Independence]] in 1776 it is estimated from tax records that about 300 people resided in Springfield.\n\nBy the 19th century Springfield had become more industrialized. Taking advantage of its many creeks for power, the inhabitants erected many mills. Well-known mill owners included William Fell, Samuel Pancoast, William Beatty, Samuel Levis, and Moses and Emanuel Hey.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century Springfield's [[Baltimore Pike]] had become one of the busiest commercial areas outside of Philadelphia. The long, straight stretch of Baltimore Pike in the township was referred to as \"''The Golden Mile''\", commonly known for its many automobile dealerships. Baltimore Pike remains true to its history with many dealerships lining the side of the road. The ''Golden Mile'' is a unique corridor that is essentially a compact commercial strip that cuts directly through bedroom communities on both sides. Residents are currently attempting to undo the emblematic effects of urban sprawl along the mile through the implementation of green initiatives, responsible traffic planning, and zoning improvements.\n\nIn the past century, all of Springfield's farmland was slowly bought up by developers who turned Springfield into the town it is today, that is, largely comprising developments of standard [[suburban]] single-family homes. One of the largest single developments was the Stoney Creek development. Construction began in 1949 and was completed in only five years. The huge development stretched from West Avenue to Providence Road and ran all the way up to Baltimore Pike. Over 75 homes were constructed in the development. Similar to most housing developments of their time, two houses in Stoney Creek were built exactly the same. While all resemble each other with their stone fronts and common size, additional luxuries such as porches and window placement were available for purchase to make each one slightly unique.\n\nThough all of the farmland of Springfield's past is gone, many of the woods and fields of the past still remain standing today in some of the many parks located throughout the community.\n\nThe bulk of Springfield's history lies recorded in the archives of the Heritage Society of Springfield, and the ''Springfield Township Public Library'' (a member of the [[List of public libraries in Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware County Library System]]).\n\nSpringfield has three sister cities, Lisbon, Portugal, Lima, Peru, and Vancouver, Canada.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n==Economy==\nThe township is home to [[Springfield Mall (Pennsylvania)|Springfield Mall]], a {{convert|590000|sqft|m2|adj=on}}, two-level shopping mall.

Originally, Springfield was primarily a farming town.\n\nOn December 9, 1687, the settlers began laying the road to Amosland as it was then called. This road is now known as Springfield Road. In 1701 construction began on the Baltimore Pike; the road was formed of sturdy oak planks, some of which still exist under the current Baltimore Pike. 1701 also marked the year that construction began on the first Quaker meeting house. The meeting house burned in 1737 and was rebuilt. The current meeting house that stands in its spot was constructed in 1851.\n\nBy the date of the signing of the [[Declaration of Independence of the United States|Declaration of Independence]] in 1776 it is estimated from tax records that about 300 people resided in Springfield.\n\nBy the 19th century Springfield had become more industrialized. Taking advantage of its many creeks for power, the inhabitants erected many mills. Well-known mill owners included William Fell, Samuel Pancoast, William Beatty, Samuel Levis, and Moses and Emanuel Hey.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century Springfield's [[Baltimore Pike]] had become one of the busiest commercial areas outside of Philadelphia. The long, straight stretch of Baltimore Pike in the township was referred to as \"''The Golden Mile''\", commonly known for its many automobile dealerships. Baltimore Pike remains true to its history with many dealerships lining the side of the road. The ''Golden Mile'' is a unique corridor that is essentially a compact commercial strip that cuts directly through bedroom communities on both sides. Residents are currently attempting to undo the emblematic effects of urban sprawl along the mile through the implementation of green initiatives, responsible traffic planning, and zoning improvements.\n\nIn the past century, all of Springfield's farmland was slowly bought up by developers who turned Springfield into the town it is today, that is, largely comprising developments of standard [[suburban]] single-family homes. One of the largest single developments was the Stoney Creek development. Construction began in 1949 and was completed in only five years. The huge development stretched from West Avenue to Providence Road and ran all the way up to Baltimore Pike. Over 75 homes were constructed in the development. Similar to most housing developments of their time, two houses in Stoney Creek were built exactly the same. While all resemble each other with their stone fronts and common size, additional luxuries such as porches and window placement were available for purchase to make each one slightly unique.\n\nThough all of the farmland of Springfield's past is gone, many of the woods and fields of the past still remain standing today in some of the many parks located throughout the community.\n\nThe bulk of Springfield's history lies recorded in the archives of the Heritage Society of Springfield, and the ''Springfield Township Public Library'' (a member of the [[List of public libraries in Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware County Library System]]).\n\nSpringfield has three sister cities, Lisbon, Portugal, Lima, Peru, and Vancouver, Canada.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n==Economy==\nThe township is home to [[Springfield Mall (Pennsylvania)|Springfield Mall]], a {{convert|590000|sqft|m2|adj=on}}, two-level shopping mall.
