A number of frameworks for building contact tracing apps have been developed.

A number of frameworks for building contact tracing apps have been developed. Privacy concerns have been raised, especially about systems that are based on tracking the geographical location of app users. Alternatives include the use of [[Bluetooth]] signals to log a user's proximity to other cellphones. On 10 April 2020, [[Google]] and [[Apple, Inc.|Apple]] jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support such Bluetooth-based apps directly into their [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] [[operating system]]s.\n\n== Countries with official tracking apps ==\nIn [[People's Republic of China|China]], the Chinese government, in conjunction with [[Alipay]], has deployed an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with people that have COVID-19.

The borough forms part of the [[Thames Gateway]] regeneration area, a corridor of opportunity that has been identified by central government as the area with greatest development and commercial potential in the country. [[Thurrock Development Corporation]] took over much of the borough's planning functions from its creation in 2005 until its demise in March 2011.\n\nMuch of the population and commercial activity is centred along the riverfront. This includes many large and important industrial sites, including two large oil refineries, manufacturing industries, a container port, cruise liner terminal, distribution warehousing and one of Britain's largest refuse disposal sites at the appropriately named settlement of Mucking. Thurrock is also home to the [[Lakeside Shopping Centre]].\n\n===Attractions===\n\n[[File:Dovecote HHPP purfleet.JPG|thumb|The Dovecote at High House]]\n\nThere is one multiplex cinema attached to the Lakeside Shopping Centre, and the Thameside Theatre in [[Grays, Essex|Grays]]. Live shows are held at the Circus Tavern in [[Purfleet]]. Open space includes [[Chafford Gorges Nature Park]], [[Langdon Hills Country Park]] and [[Grove House Wood]], managed by [[Essex Wildlife Trust]]. Museums and historic buildings include [[Coalhouse Fort]] at [[East Tilbury]], [[Tilbury Fort]] in [[Tilbury]], Purfleet Heritage and Military Centre, [[High House, Purfleet]] with its historic farm buildings, the Royal Opera House's  Bob and Tamar Manoukian Production Workshop, The Backstage Centre and ACME artists' studios, Thurrock Museum and Walton Hall Farm Museum.\n\nNext to [[Lakeside Shopping Centre]] is Arena Essex, a motor sports complex, where speedway, banger and stock car racing takes place.\n\n===Thurrock in Bloom===\nThurrock in Bloom is a voluntary group that works in partnership with Thurrock Council and co-sponsors such as Sandown Nursery and Elm Horticulture to promote floral displays.

Man has been in the area since [[prehistoric times]]<ref name=catton/> and the land has been farmed by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]]<ref name=catton/> and [[Anglo-Saxons]]<ref name=catton/> Thurrock has numerous [[List of archaeological sites in Thurrock|archaeological sites]] including the major excavation at [[Mucking excavation|Mucking]].\n\n[[File:Wool-market.jpg|thumb|left|The Woolmarket]] [[Horndon-on-the-Hill]] was the site of an [[Horndon mint|11th century mint]] as well as the 15th century woolmarket which gives an indication of the area's wealth in the 15th century. The narrowing of the river where Tilbury now stands meant it was important in the defence of [[London]], and [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] built three blockhouses, two on the Tilbury side and another on the Gravesend side of the river, following the end of his marriage to [[Catherine of Aragon]].\n\nIn 1381, villagers from [[Fobbing]], Mucking and [[Stanford-le-Hope]] instigated the [[Peasants' Revolt|Peasant's Revolt]] when they were called to [[Brentwood, Essex|Brentwood]] to pay the [[poll tax]]. When they refused to pay, a riot ensued which was the catalyst for a mass protest across [[Essex]] and [[Kent]].\n\nLater, in 1588 [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] addressed her troops not far from the Tilbury blockhouse as the [[Spanish Armada]] sailed up the [[English Channel]]. Between 1670 and 1682, the Tilbury blockhouse was substantially rebuilt into a much larger fortification ([[Tilbury Fort]]) and Coalhouse Fort was built further down river, close to the second blockhouse. The importance of the forts in defending the country continued through [[Napoleon]]ic times and into the two world wars. The land where Tilbury Town now stands was farmland and marsh grazing until the building of the docks in the 1890s. Thurrock includes the [[East Tilbury#History|Bata village]], built for workers of the shoe company in 1933. Eight homes and the factory are listed.\n \nHistorically, the area was renowned for mineral extraction, including clay, aggregates and notably the digging of huge amounts of chalk from the West Thurrock area for use in the now defunct cement industries. When chalk extraction ceased one of the disused pits was redeveloped as Lakeside Shopping Centre. A number of former pits have been used to form the Chafford Gorges Nature Reserve, managed by the Essex Wildlife Trust.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.essexfieldclub.org.uk/resource/Introduction%20to%20the%20geology%20of%20Essex|title=The Geology of Essex}}</ref>\n\nThe present-day borough of Thurrock was created in 1974 from the former area of [[Thurrock Urban District]]. The [[Local Government Act 1972]] left the boundaries mostly untouched, although part of it, in [[Basildon]] New Town, was ceded to the [[Basildon (district)|Basildon district]] and the district gained borough status.<ref>[http://www.thurrock.gov.uk/museum/content.php?page=crest ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205203009/http://www.thurrock.gov.uk/museum/content.php?page=crest |date=5 December 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIt was given administrative independence from Essex County Council on 1 April 1998 by ''The Essex (Boroughs of Colchester, Southend-on-Sea and Thurrock and District of Tendring) (Structural, Boundary and Electoral Changes) Order 1996''. It remains part of Essex for [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial]] purposes such as [[lord-lieutenancy]].\n\n===Captain Kidd===\nThe body of [[William Kidd|Captain Kidd]] was displayed in Thurrock. He had been convicted of piracy and hanged on 23 May 1701, at '[[Execution Dock]]', [[Wapping]].

The Van den Berghs and Jurgens margarine factory, which manufactured [[Stork margarine]], was forced to stop production for many months. Since the output of this factory constituted one third of the country's ration allocation, this led to a severe strain on the supply of margarine in the UK.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Great Tide|first=Hilda|last=Grieve|year=1959|publisher=Essex County Council|page=466}}</ref> Most schools in Thurrock were closed, either as a direct result of the flooding or in order to use them to help the relief effort.

It is part of the [[London commuter belt]] and an area of regeneration within the [[Thames Gateway]] redevelopment zone. The local authority is [[Thurrock Council]].\n\n==The borough==\nIt lies on the [[River Thames]] just to the east of [[London]]. With over {{convert|18|mi}} of riverfront it covers an area of {{convert|64|sqmi}}, with more than half defined as [[Green Belt]]. With [[Greater London]] to the west and the river to the south, the county of Essex abuts the Borough to the north and east, and across the river lies [[Kent]].\n\n===Politics===\nThe local authority is [[Thurrock Council]]. [[Thurrock local elections|Elections]] are held 3 out of every 4 years. In 2016, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Party took control of the council, albeit as a minority-party administration.\n\nThurrock is covered by two parliamentary constituencies. [[Thurrock (UK Parliament constituency)|Thurrock]] includes most of the borough while [[South Basildon and East Thurrock (UK Parliament constituency)|South Basildon and East Thurrock]] includes some wards in the east of the borough. Both seats were Conservative gains from Labour at the 2010 general election.\n\nThe Council is led by Cllr Rob Gledhill (C) as of May 2016. The Mayor is Cllr Barbara Rice (L).\n\n===Land use===\nThurrock has a population of 157,500<ref>{{cite web|author=Neighbourhood Statistics |url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=6275283&c=thurrock&d=13&e=61&g=6395496&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&o=362&m=0&r=1&s=1373049325485&enc=1&dsFamilyId=2491 |title=Check Browser Settings |publisher=Neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-07-05}}</ref> people living in 90,500 homes. The [[Metropolitan Green Belt]] covers 70% of the borough. There are {{convert|494|acres|ha}} of land available for industrial use.<ref>[http://www.thurrock.gov.uk/planning/strategic/content.php?page=factsheet_01 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029021726/http://www.thurrock.gov.uk/planning/strategic/content.php?page=factsheet_01 |date=29 October 2012 }}</ref> There are seven [[conservation area]]s, 19 [[scheduled ancient monument]]s, including the [[dovecote]] at [[High House Purfleet]], and 239 [[listed building]]s.\n\nThe borough contains ten sites of [[Sites of Special Scientific Interest|special scientific interest]]: \n*Globe Pit, Grays\n*Grays Chalk Pit\n*Lion Pit, Grays\n*Purfleet Chalk Pits\n*West Thurrock Lagoon and Marshes\n*Inner Thames Marshes\n*Vange and Fobbing Marshes\n*Basildon Meadows\n*Mucking Flats and Marshes\n*[[Hangman's Wood]] and Deneholes\n\nDespite much of the borough being protected Green Belt land, Thurrock provides localised opportunities for further industrial and commercial development. The borough forms part of the [[Thames Gateway]] regeneration area, a corridor of opportunity that has been identified by central government as the area with greatest development and commercial potential in the country. [[Thurrock Development Corporation]] took over much of the borough's planning functions from its creation in 2005 until its demise in March 2011.\n\nMuch of the population and commercial activity is centred along the riverfront. This includes many large and important industrial sites, including two large oil refineries, manufacturing industries, a container port, cruise liner terminal, distribution warehousing and one of Britain's largest refuse disposal sites at the appropriately named settlement of Mucking. Thurrock is also home to the [[Lakeside Shopping Centre]].\n\n===Attractions===\n\n[[File:Dovecote HHPP purfleet.JPG|thumb|The Dovecote at High House]]\n\nThere is one multiplex cinema attached to the Lakeside Shopping Centre, and the Thameside Theatre in [[Grays]]. Live shows are held at the Circus Tavern in [[Purfleet]]. Open space includes [[Chafford Gorges Nature Park]], [[Langdon Hills Country Park]] and [[Grove House Wood]], managed by [[Essex Wildlife Trust]]. Museums and historic buildings include [[Coalhouse Fort]] at [[East Tilbury]], [[Tilbury Fort]] in [[Tilbury]], Purfleet Heritage and Military Centre, [[High House, Purfleet]] with its historic farm buildings, the Royal Opera House's  Bob and Tamar Manoukian Production Workshop, The Backstage Centre and ACME artists' studios, Thurrock Museum and Walton Hall Farm Museum.\n\nNext to [[Lakeside Shopping Centre]] is Arena Essex, a motor sports complex, where speedway, banger and stock car racing takes place.\n\n===Thurrock in Bloom===\nThurrock in Bloom is a voluntary group that works in partnership with Thurrock Council and co-sponsors such as Sandown Nursery and Elm Horticulture to promote floral displays. It is part of a more general \"in bloom\" initiative organised by the [[Royal Horticultural Society]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rhs.org.uk/britaininbloom/index.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100417071512/http://www.rhs.org.uk/britaininbloom/index.html|url-status=dead|title=Britain in Bloom|archivedate=17 April 2010}}</ref> The Thurrock initiative includes an annual competition<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thurrock.gov.uk/cleanstreets/inbloom/|title=Overview - Thurrock in Bloom - Thurrock Council|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123071145/http://www.thurrock.gov.uk/cleanstreets/inbloom/|archivedate=23 January 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and sponsorship of roundabouts.<ref>[http://democracy.thurrock.gov.uk/CMISWebPublic/Binary.ashx?Document=175 Roundabout sponsorship]</ref> Award winners include [http://www.woodsideprimary.org Woodside Primary School] which has received silver and gold awards for its wildlife garden.\n\n==History==\n\n[[Mammoths]] once grazed in the Thurrock area<ref name=catton>Catton, Jonathan, ''A Short History of Thurrock'' in {{cite book|title=Exploring Thurrock|publisher=Thurrock Local History Society|year=2008|editor=Christopher Harrold}}</ref> and archaeologists recently unearthed the remains of a jungle cat. Man has been in the area since [[prehistoric times]]<ref name=catton/> and the land has been farmed by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]]<ref name=catton/> and [[Anglo-Saxons]]<ref name=catton/> Thurrock has numerous [[List of archaeological sites in Thurrock|archaeological sites]] including the major excavation at [[Mucking excavation|Mucking]].\n\n[[File:Wool-market.jpg|thumb|left|The Woolmarket]] [[Horndon-on-the-Hill]] was the site of an [[Horndon mint|11th century mint]] as well as the 15th century woolmarket which gives an indication of the area's wealth in the 15th century. The narrowing of the river where Tilbury now stands meant it was important in the defence of [[London]], and [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] built three blockhouses, two on the Tilbury side and another on the Gravesend side of the river, following the end of his marriage to [[Catherine of Aragon]].\n\nIn 1381, villagers from [[Fobbing]], Mucking and [[Stanford-le-Hope]] instigated the [[Peasants' Revolt|Peasant's Revolt]] when they were called to [[Brentwood, Essex|Brentwood]] to pay the [[poll tax]]. When they refused to pay, a riot ensued which was the catalyst for a mass protest across [[Essex]] and [[Kent]].\n\nLater, in 1588 [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] addressed her troops not far from the Tilbury blockhouse as the [[Spanish Armada]] sailed up the [[English Channel]]. Between 1670 and 1682, the Tilbury blockhouse was substantially rebuilt into a much larger fortification ([[Tilbury Fort]]) and Coalhouse Fort was built further down river, close to the second blockhouse. The importance of the forts in defending the country continued through [[Napoleon]]ic times and into the two world wars. The land where Tilbury Town now stands was farmland and marsh grazing until the building of the docks in the 1890s. Thurrock includes the [[East Tilbury#History|Bata village]], built for workers of the shoe company in 1933. Eight homes and the factory are listed.\n \nHistorically, the area was renowned for mineral extraction, including clay, aggregates and notably the digging of huge amounts of chalk from the West Thurrock area for use in the now defunct cement industries. When chalk extraction ceased one of the disused pits was redeveloped as Lakeside Shopping Centre. A number of former pits have been used to form the Chafford Gorges Nature Reserve, managed by the Essex Wildlife Trust.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.essexfieldclub.org.uk/resource/Introduction%20to%20the%20geology%20of%20Essex|title=The Geology of Essex}}</ref>\n\nThe present-day borough of Thurrock was created in 1974 from the former area of [[Thurrock Urban District]]. The [[Local Government Act 1972]] left the boundaries mostly untouched, although part of it, in [[Basildon]] New Town, was ceded to the [[Basildon (district)|Basildon district]] and the district gained borough status.<ref>[http://www.thurrock.gov.uk/museum/content.php?page=crest ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205203009/http://www.thurrock.gov.uk/museum/content.php?page=crest |date=5 December 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIt was given administrative independence from Essex County Council on 1 April 1998 by ''The Essex (Boroughs of Colchester, Southend-on-Sea and Thurrock and District of Tendring) (Structural, Boundary and Electoral Changes) Order 1996''. It remains part of Essex for [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial]] purposes such as [[lord-lieutenancy]].\n\n===Captain Kidd===\nThe body of [[William Kidd|Captain Kidd]] was displayed in Thurrock. He had been convicted of piracy and hanged on 23 May 1701, at '[[Execution Dock]]', [[Wapping]]. His body was ''[[gibbet]]ed'' &mdash; left to hang in an iron cage over the Thames at Tilbury Point<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/info_sheets_piracy.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=21 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612082349/http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/info_sheets_piracy.htm |archive-date=12 June 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> &mdash; as a warning to future would-be pirates for twenty years. Some sources give the location where his body was exhibited as Tilbury Ness, but this may be an alternative name for the same place. There is some uncertainty as to whether his body was displayed at what is now called Coalhouse Point or at a site a few hundred yards up stream, close to the present Tilbury Docks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thurrock.gov.uk/heritage/content.php?page=factfiles_details&id=8|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608211536/http://www.thurrock.gov.uk/heritage/content.php?page=factfiles_details&id=8|url-status=dead|title=Captain Kidd - the Tilbury connection|archivedate=8 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n===1953 Floods===\nOn 31 January 1953, the low-lying areas of Thurrock were inundated by the [[North Sea flood of 1953]]. The Van den Berghs and Jurgens margarine factory, which manufactured [[Stork margarine]], was forced to stop production for many months. Since the output of this factory constituted one third of the country's ration allocation, this led to a severe strain on the supply of margarine in the UK.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Great Tide|first=Hilda|last=Grieve|year=1959|publisher=Essex County Council|page=466}}</ref> Most schools in Thurrock were closed, either as a direct result of the flooding or in order to use them to help the relief effort.

It is one of the few surviving examples of 1930s cinema architecture. It has the original cinema organ which can still be played. However, in the early 21st century the building became disused and faced dereliction. In September 2015 it was announced that [[Wetherspoons|J D Wetherspoon]] had bought the property for conversion to a public house.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thurrockgazette.co.uk/news/13718230.Pub_chain_JD_Wetherspoon_confirm_purchase_of_State_Cinema/?ref=mr&lp=4|title=Pub chain JD Wetherspoon confirm purchase of State Cinema|work=Thurrock Gazette}}</ref> Building of the [[Bata Shoes]] estate in East Tilbury was begun in 1933 and this is now a conservation area.\n\nChadwell St Mary has one of the few examples of a \"Sunspan\" house designed by the architect [[Wells Coates]]. Although built in the 1950s, Woodside Primary School's architecture has been described as the slightly earlier \"ocean liner\" style of Art Deco. The building features a number of bricked curves and circular windows, while the wrought-iron banisters on the stairs are deliberately set to lean out at an angle.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|width = 10em\n|shading = off\n|1911 |2500\n|1951 |82100\n|1961 |114300\n|1971 |125000\n|1981 |127400\n|1985 |124600\n|[[United Kingdom Census 1991|1991]] |128700\n|1995 |133400\n|[[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001]] |143300\n|2005 |148900\n|2007 |152200\n|[[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011]] |158300\n|footnote= All totals rounded to nearest hundred\n|source = [http://www.populstat.info/Europe/unkingdt.htm Populstat] & [http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/lmp/la/1946157204/subreports/pop_time_series/report.aspx?

{"title_page": "Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic", "text_new": "{{short description|Professional wrestling tag team tournament}}\n[[File:Dusty Classic.png|thumb|upright|Official logo of the tournament]]\nThe '''Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic''' is an annual [[professional wrestling]] [[tag team]] tournament held by the [[United States|U.S.]]-based promotion [[WWE]], and is featured on its [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]] brand. Since the 2020 edition, wrestlers from the [[NXT UK (WWE brand)|NXT UK]] brand are also featured.\n\nThe tournament is named in honor of [[WWE Hall of Fame]] wrestler [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]], who died in 2015.  The tournament has been compared to and (at least partially) inspired by the [[Jim Crockett Sr. Memorial Cup Tag Team Tournament|Crockett Cup]] tournaments of the 1980s that were promoted by [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] (which would later become more widely known as [[World Championship Wrestling]]). Rhodes himself had been both the behind the scenes creator of and a featured performer in those tournaments.<ref>[http://www.hiddenremote.com/2015/09/03/wwe-3-thoughts-9215-nxt 9/3/15 NXT recap - Hidden Remote.com]</ref>\n\n==Tournament history==\nThe 16-team single elimination tournament was established in August 2015 as a tribute to Rhodes - who had been serving as a senior producer and trainer in NXT - and was formally announced during [[NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn]], which took place shortly after he had died. That year's Classic featured tournament matches taking place all through September both on ''[[WWE NXT (TV series)|NXT]]'s'' weekly TV show and at NXT house shows, and would culminate in October at [[NXT TakeOver: Respect#Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic|NXT TakeOver: Respect]], with the team of [[Finn B\u00e1lor]] and [[Samoa Joe]] winning, having defeated  [[Baron Corbin]] and [[Rhyno]] in the final.<ref>[http://uproxx.com/prowrestling/the-best-and-worst-of-nxt-takeover-respect Best and worst of NXT TakeOver:Respect - Uproxx.com]</ref>\n\nThe second Classic took place throughout the fall of 2016 - again with a 16-team field - which eventually culminating in November at [[NXT TakeOver: Toronto (2016)|NXT TakeOver: Toronto]], where it was won by The Authors of Pain, having defeated TM-61.<ref>[http://www.wwe.com/shows/wwenxt/article/2016-dusty-rhodes-tag-team-classic-teams-revealed 2016 Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic - WWE.com]</ref><ref>[http://uproxx.com/prowrestling/dusty-rhodes-tag-team-classic-teams-revealed 2016 Dusty Rhodes tag Team Classic teams revealed - Uproxx.com]</ref><ref>[https://in.news.yahoo.com/2016-dusty-rhodes-tag-team-184800566.html Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic - Yahoo.com]</ref>\n\nThere was no tournament held in 2017 after taking an extra half year to switch to a spring schedule, returning in 2018.  Now featuring an eight-team field, the 2018 Classic culminated at [[NXT TakeOver: New Orleans]],<ref>[http://www.wwe.com/shows/wwenxt/article/dusty-rhodes-tag-team-classic-bracket-2018-reveal]</ref> the night before [[WrestleMania 34]]. It was won by [[Adam Cole]] and [[Kyle O'Reilly]] of [[The Undisputed Era]], who successfully defended their [[NXT Tag Team Championship]] in a Winner Takes All Triple Threat match against both tournament finalists, [[The Authors of Pain]] and [[Roderick Strong]] and [[Pete Dunne (wrestler)|Pete Dunne]].\n\nThe fourth Classic was held in February and March 2019.  [[Aleister Black]] and [[Ricochet (wrestler)|Ricochet]] won the eight-team tournament, ultimately defeating [[The Forgotten Sons]]  ([[Wesley Blake]] and Steve Cutler) in the final on March 13 during the ''WWE NXT'' tapings.\n\nThe fifth Classic was announced during the January 1, 2020 episode of ''NXT''. again featuring an eight-team field, and for the first time including teams from sister brand [[NXT UK (WWE brand)|NXT UK]], with both brands having four teams each in the tournament.<ref>[http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/teams-revealed-for-2020-dusty-rhodes-tag-team-classic Teams revealed for 2020 Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic - 411 Mania.com]</ref>  All four first round matches featured direct NXT vs. NXT UK matchups, and the semifinals and finals also wound up featuring NXT teams vs. NXT UK teams.  The BroserWeights ([[Matt Riddle]] and [[Pete Dunne]]) representing NXT won the tournament, defeating NXT UK's Grizzled Young Veterans ([[Zack Gibson]] and [[James Drake (wrestler)|James Drake]]) on the live January 29, 2020 episode of ''NXT'' in the finals.\n\n==Prize==\nThe winners of the tournament receive a trophy that is modeled in part after Rhodes' signature \"cowboy\" style wrestling

Classic.png|thumb|upright|Official logo of the tournament]]\nThe '''Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic''' is an annual [[professional wrestling]] [[tag team]] tournament held by the [[United States|U.S.]]-based promotion [[WWE]], and is featured on its [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]] brand. Since the 2020 edition, wrestlers from the [[NXT UK (WWE brand)|NXT UK]] brand are also featured.\n\nThe tournament is named in honor of [[WWE Hall of Fame]] wrestler [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]], who died in 2015.  The tournament has been compared to and (at least partially) inspired by the [[Jim Crockett Sr. Memorial Cup Tag Team Tournament|Crockett Cup]] tournaments of the 1980s that were promoted by [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] (which would later become more widely known as [[World Championship Wrestling]]). Rhodes himself had been both the behind the scenes creator of and a featured performer in those tournaments.<ref>[http://www.hiddenremote.com/2015/09/03/wwe-3-thoughts-9215-nxt 9/3/15 NXT recap - Hidden Remote.com]</ref>\n\n==Tournament history==\nThe 16-team single elimination tournament was established in August 2015 as a tribute to Rhodes - who had been serving as a senior producer and trainer in NXT - and was formally announced during [[NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn]], which took place shortly after he had died. That year's Classic featured tournament matches taking place all through September both on ''[[WWE NXT (TV series)|NXT]]'s'' weekly TV show and at NXT house shows, and would culminate in October at [[NXT TakeOver: Respect#Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic|NXT TakeOver: Respect]], with the team of [[Finn B\u00e1lor]] and [[Samoa Joe]] winning, having defeated  [[Baron Corbin]] and [[Rhyno]] in the final.<ref>[http://uproxx.com/prowrestling/the-best-and-worst-of-nxt-takeover-respect Best and worst of NXT TakeOver:Respect - Uproxx.com]</ref>\n\nThe second Classic took place throughout the fall of 2016 - again with a 16-team field - which eventually culminating in November at [[NXT TakeOver: Toronto (2016)|NXT TakeOver: Toronto]], where it was won by The Authors of Pain, having defeated TM-61.<ref>[http://www.wwe.com/shows/wwenxt/article/2016-dusty-rhodes-tag-team-classic-teams-revealed 2016 Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic - WWE.com]</ref><ref>[http://uproxx.com/prowrestling/dusty-rhodes-tag-team-classic-teams-revealed 2016 Dusty Rhodes tag Team Classic teams revealed - Uproxx.com]</ref><ref>[https://in.news.yahoo.com/2016-dusty-rhodes-tag-team-184800566.html Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic - Yahoo.com]</ref>\n\nThere was no tournament held in 2017 after taking an extra half year to switch to a spring schedule, returning in 2018.  Now featuring an eight-team field, the 2018 Classic culminated at [[NXT TakeOver: New Orleans]],<ref>[http://www.wwe.com/shows/wwenxt/article/dusty-rhodes-tag-team-classic-bracket-2018-reveal]</ref> the night before [[WrestleMania 34]]. It was won by [[Adam Cole]] and [[Kyle O'Reilly]] of [[The Undisputed Era]], who successfully defended their [[NXT Tag Team Championship]] in a Winner Takes All Triple Threat match against both tournament finalists, [[The Authors of Pain]] and [[Roderick Strong]] and [[Pete Dunne (wrestler)|Pete Dunne]].\n\nThe fourth Classic was held in February and March 2019.  [[Aleister Black]] and [[Ricochet (wrestler)|Ricochet]] won the eight-team tournament, ultimately defeating [[The Forgotten Sons]]  ([[Wesley Blake]] and Steve Cutler) in the final on March 13 during the ''WWE NXT'' tapings.\n\nThe fifth Classic was announced during the January 1, 2020 episode of ''NXT''. again featuring an eight-team field, and for the first time including teams from sister brand [[NXT UK (WWE brand)|NXT UK]], with both brands having four teams each in the tournament.<ref>[http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/teams-revealed-for-2020-dusty-rhodes-tag-team-classic Teams revealed for 2020 Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic - 411 Mania.com]</ref>  All four first round matches featured direct NXT vs. NXT UK matchups, and the semifinals and finals also wound up featuring NXT teams vs. NXT UK teams.  The BroserWeights ([[Matt Riddle]] and [[Pete Dunne]]) representing NXT won the tournament, defeating NXT UK's Grizzled Young Veterans ([[Zack Gibson]] and [[James Drake (wrestler)|James Drake]]) on the live January 29, 2020 episode of ''NXT'' in the finals.\n\n==Prize==\nThe winners of the tournament receive a trophy that is modeled in part after Rhodes' signature \"cowboy\" style wrestling boots.<ref>[http://attainc.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/dusty-rhodes-trophy-banner-8.jpg Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic trophy]</ref> \n\nIn 2019, the winners also received an [[NXT Tag Team

If proven to be a leech, it would be the oldest in the fossil record.]]\nPrior to the discovery of the Waukesha Biota, very little was known about the soft-bodied animals that were sure to have lived in the Silurian seas. Thanks to the famous [[Burgess Shale]] of the [[Canadian Rockies]], we knew that the seas were already teaming with soft-bodied and lightly skeletonized animals as far back as the [[Cambrian]], yet relatively few were known to be preserved in later [[Paleozoic]] rocks. This is because the fossil record is greatly skewed toward biomineralized skeletal remains. The announcement of the Waukesha Biota in 1985 thus marked a major turning point in our knowledge of Silurian life. In his popular book, ''Wonderful Life'', [[Stephen Jay Gould]] compared the \"anatomical disparity\" of the Burgess Shale with that of only five other occurrences in the world \u2013one of which was the Waukesha Biota, which he referred to as the \"Brandon Bridge fauna\"\u2013 and none of the others were Silurian.<ref name=Gould1989>{{cite book |last=Gould  |first=S.J. |title=Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History |date=1989 |publisher=W.W.

If proven to be a leech, it would be the oldest in the fossil record.]]\nPrior to the discovery of the Waukesha Biota, very little was known about the soft-bodied animals that were sure to have lived in the Silurian seas. Thanks to the famous [[Burgess Shale]] of the [[Canadian Rockies]], we knew that the seas were already teaming with soft-bodied and lightly skeletonized animals as far back as the [[Cambrian]], yet relatively few were known to be preserved in later [[Paleozoic]] rocks. This is because the fossil record is greatly skewed toward biomineralized skeletal remains. The announcement of the Waukesha Biota in 1985 thus marked a major turning point in our knowledge of Silurian life. In his popular book, ''Wonderful Life'', [[Stephen Jay Gould]] compared the \"anatomical disparity\" of the Burgess Shale with that of only five other occurrences in the world \u2013one of which was the Waukesha Biota, which he referred to as the \"Brandon Bridge fauna\"\u2013 and none of the others were Silurian.<ref name=Gould1989>{{cite book |last=Gould  |first=S.J. |title=Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History |date=1989 |publisher=W.W.

Originally, when London consisted of little more than the [[City of London|City]], the term applied to all Londoners, but as the city grew this was replaced by less universal definitions. A common view is that in order to be a cockney, one must have been born within earshot of Bow Bells, the bells of [[St Mary-le-Bow]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stmarylebow.co.uk/#/bow-bells/4535373284|title=St Mary-le-Bow|website=www.stmarylebow.co.uk}}</ref> which were cast at the [[Whitechapel Bell Foundry]]. However, the church of St Mary-le-Bow was destroyed in 1666 by the [[Great Fire of London]] and rebuilt by [[Sir Christopher Wren]]. Although the bells were destroyed again in 1941 in [[the Blitz]], they had fallen silent on 13 June 1940 as part of the [[British anti-invasion preparations of World War II]]. Before they were replaced in 1961, there was a period when, by the \"within earshot\" definition, no \"Bow Bell\" cockneys could be born.<ref>J. Swinnerton, ''The London Companion'' (Robson, 2004), p. 21.</ref> The use of such a literal definition produces other problems, since the area around the church is no longer residential and the noise of the area makes it unlikely that many people would now be born within earshot of the bells,{{Sfnp|Wright|1981|p=11}} Similarly, there were in the past, several hospitals in audible range; but now there is just the [[Royal London Hospital]] in [[Whitechapel]], with home births now uncommon.\n\nThe terms \u201cEast End of London\u201d and \u201cwithin the sound of bow bells\u201d are used interchangeably, and the bells are a symbol of East End identity. However the Bow Bells definition reflects the earlier definition of Cockney as relating to all Londoners (at a time when London barely extended beyond the [[City of London|square mile]]. The use of the term to describe all [[London]]ers generally, however, survived into the 19th century<ref name=\"hott\" /> before becoming restricted to the working class and their particular accent. The term is now used loosely to describe all [[East End of London|East Londoners]], irrespective of their speech.\n\nA study was carried out by the [[City of London|City]] in 2000 to see how far away Bow Bells could be heard,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://public.oed.com/aspects-of-english/english-in-use/cockney/|title=Cockney - Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=}}</ref> and it was estimated that the bells would have been heard up to six miles to the east, five miles to the north, three miles to the south, and four miles to the west. According to the legend of [[Dick Whittington]] the bells could once be heard from as far away as the Highgate [[Archway, London|Archway]] (4.5 miles north). Based on a definition of the bells audible range, all East Enders are cockneys, but not all cockneys are East Enders; though whereas an East Ender would be likely to proudly claim that entitlement, a resident of west, north or south London would be less likely to. The traditional core districts of the [[East End of London|East End]] are [[Bethnal Green]], [[Whitechapel]], [[Spitalfields]], [[Stepney]], [[Wapping]], [[Limehouse]], [[Poplar, London|Poplar]], [[Haggerston]], [[Aldgate]], [[Shoreditch]], [[Millwall]], [[Cubitt Town]], [[Hackney Central|Hackney]], [[Hoxton]], [[Bow, London|Bow]] and [[Mile End]]. The area north of the Thames gradually expanded to include [[East Ham]], [[Stratford, London|Stratford]], [[Leyton]], [[West Ham]] and [[Plaistow, Newham|Plaistow]] as more land was built upon.\n\nWriting in 1981, the dialectologist Peter Wright identified the building of the [[Becontree]] estate near [[Dagenham]] in Essex as influential in the spread of cockney dialect. This very large estate was built by the [[Corporation of London]] to house poor residents of London's East End on what was previously a rural area of Essex, and the residents generally kept their native cockney dialect rather than adopt an Essex dialect.{{Sfnp|Wright|1981|p=146}} Wright also reports that cockney dialect spread along the main railway routes to towns in the surrounding counties as early as 1923, and cockney then spread further after World War II as many refugees left London owing to the bombing, but continued to speak cockney in their new homes.{{Sfnp|Wright|1981|p=147}}\n\n== Notable cockneys ==<!-- New links in alphabetical order please -->\n<!-- *** ATTENTION*** Please cite entries with a reliable source for a person being explicitly known as, or calling themselves, a Cockney -->\n{{More citations needed|section|date=December 2018}}\n*[[Danny Baker]] (broadcaster, born in [[Deptford]])\n*[[Michael Caine]] (actor, born as Maurice Joseph Micklewhite, Jr., 14 March 1933, in [[Rotherhithe]])<ref>{{Cite news|title=Screening Room Special: Michael Caine|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/Movies/09/30/caine.october/|agency=CNN|issue=29 October 2007|date=25 June 2015}}</ref>\n*[[Alfie Bass]] actor from [[Bethnal Green]].\n*[[Charlie Chaplin]] (comic actor, filmmaker, and composer, 16 April 1889, born in [[Walworth, London]])\n*[[Roger Daltrey]] (singer, actor and vocalist of [[The Who]], 1 March 1944, born in [[East Acton]], [[London]])\n*[[Alan Ford (actor)|Alan Ford]], (actor, born in [[Walworth]])\n*[[Steve Harley]] (musician, frontman of the band Cockney Rebel, born in [[Deptford]])\n*[[Hoxton Tom McCourt]], musician, face, born in [[Shoreditch]] and lived in [[Hoxton]]\n*[[Lenny McLean]], bare knuckle/unlicensed boxer, actor, born in Hoxton\n*[[Claude Rains]], the actor born in [[Camberwell]] in 1889 became famous after abandoning his heavy cockney accent and developing a unique [[Mid-Atlantic accent]] described as \"half American, half English and a little Cockney thrown in\".\n*[[Harry Redknapp]] (former footballer and manager born in [[Poplar, London|Poplar]])\n*[[Tommy Steele]] (1950s pop and film artist, born in [[Bermondsey]])\n*[[Kray twins]], criminals, born in [[Hoxton]] and lived in [[Bethnal Green]]\n*[[Barbara Windsor]] actress born in [[Shoreditch]], [[London]]\n*[[Ray Winstone]] (actor, born in [[Homerton]])<ref>{{Cite news|title=Ray Winstone: Me cockney accent won the role|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/news/ray-winstone-me-cockney-accent-won-the-role-226465/|work=WhatsonTV|issue=13 November 2016|access-date=17 January 2017}}</ref>\n*[[Arthur Smith (comedian)|Arthur Smith]] (comedian from [[Bermondsey]])\n*[[Micky Flanagan]] (comedian from [[Whitechapel]])\n*[[Eric Bristow]] (darts champion born in Hackney.

The development of ''L''-vocalisation (see next section) leads to further pairs such as ''sole''-''soul'' {{IPA|[s\u0252\u028a]}} vs. ''so''-''sew'' {{IPA|[s\u0250\u0264\u0308]}}, ''bowl'' {{IPA|[b\u0252\u028a]}} vs. ''Bow'' {{IPA|[b\u0250\u0264\u0308]}}, ''shoulder'' {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0283\u0252\u028ad\u0259]}} vs. ''odour'' {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0250\u0264\u0308d\u0259]}}, while associated vowel neutralisations may make ''doll'' a homophone of ''dole'', compare ''dough'' {{IPA|[d\u0250\u0264\u0308]}}. All this reinforces the phonemic nature of the opposition and increases its functional load. It is now well-established in all kinds of London-flavoured accents, from broad cockney to near-RP.{{Sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=312\u2013313}}\n** {{IPA|/\u028a/}} in some words (particularly ''good''){{Sfnp|Mott|2011|p=75}} is central {{IPAblink|\u028a\u0308}}.{{Sfnp|Mott|2012|p=75}} In other cases, it is near-close near-back {{IPAblink|\u028a}}, as in traditional RP.{{Sfnp|Mott|2012|p=75}}\n*[[L-vocalisation|Vocalisation of dark L]], hence {{IPA|[\u02c8m\u026aow\u0254\u02d0]}} for [[Millwall]]. The actual realisation of a vocalised {{IPA|/l/}} is influenced by surrounding vowels and it may be realised as {{IPA|[u]}}, {{IPA|[\u028a]}}, {{IPA|[o]}} or {{IPA|[\u0264]}}. It is also transcribed as a [[semivowel]] {{IPA|[w]}} by some linguists, e.g., Coggle and Rosewarne.{{Sfnp|Sivertsen|1960|p=132}} However, according to {{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996}}, the vocalised dark l is sometimes an unoccluded lateral approximant, which differs from the RP {{IPA|[\u026b]}} only by the lack of the alveolar contact.{{Sfnp|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=193}} Relatedly, there are many possible vowel neutralisations and absorptions in the context of a following dark L ({{IPA|[\u026b]}}) or its vocalised version; these include:{{Sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=313\u2013317}}\n**In broad cockney, and to some extent in general popular London speech, a vocalised {{IPA|/l/}} is entirely absorbed by a preceding {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}}: e.g., ''salt'' and ''sort'' become homophones (although the contemporary pronunciation of ''salt'' {{IPA|/s\u0252lt/}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/sounds/activities/phonological-change/ |title=Phonological change in spoken English |publisher=Bl.uk |date=12 March 2007 |access-date=1 October 2010}}</ref> would prevent this from happening), and likewise ''fault''-''fought''-''fort'', ''pause''-''Paul's'', ''Morden''-''Malden'', ''water''-''Walter''. Sometimes such pairs are kept apart, in more deliberate speech at least, by a kind of length difference: {{IPA|[\u02c8m\u0254\u028adn\u0329]}} ''Morden'' vs. {{IPA|[\u02c8m\u0254\u028a\u02d0dn\u0329]}} ''Malden''.\n**A preceding {{IPA|/\u0259/}} is also fully absorbed into vocalised {{IPA|/l/}}. The reflexes of earlier {{IPA|/\u0259l/}} and earlier {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0(l)/}} are thus phonetically similar or identical; speakers are usually ready to treat them as the same phoneme. Thus ''awful'' can best be regarded as containing two occurrences of the same vowel, {{IPA|/\u02c8\u0254\u02d0f\u0254\u02d0/}}. The difference between ''musical'' and ''music-hall'', in an ''H''-dropping broad cockney, is thus nothing more than a matter of stress and perhaps syllable boundaries.\n**With the remaining vowels a vocalised {{IPA|/l/}} is not absorbed, but remains phonetically present as a back vocoid in such a way that {{IPA|/Vl/}} and {{IPA|/V/}} are kept distinct.\n**The clearest and best-established neutralisations are those of {{IPA|/\u026a~i\u02d0~\u026a\u0259/}} and {{IPA|/\u028a~u\u02d0~\u028a\u0259/}}. Thus ''rill'', ''reel'' and ''real'' fall together in cockney as {{IPA|[\u0279\u026a\u0264]}}; while ''full'' and ''fool'' are {{IPA|[fo\u028a~f\u028au]}} and may rhyme with ''cruel'' {{IPA|[\u02c8k\u02b0\u0279\u028au]}}. Before clear (i.e., prevocalic) {{IPA|/l/}} the neutralisations do not usually apply, thus {{IPA|[\u02c8s\u026ali]}} ''silly'' but {{IPA|[\u02c8s\u026ail\u026an]}} ''ceiling''-''sealing'', {{IPA|[\u02c8f\u028ali]}} ''fully'' but {{IPA|[\u02c8f\u028aul\u026an]}} ''fooling''.\n**In some broader types of cockney, the neutralisation of {{IPA|/\u028a~u\u02d0~\u028a\u0259/}} before non-prevocalic {{IPA|/l/}} may also involve {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}}, so that ''fall'' becomes homophonous with ''full'' and ''fool'' {{IPA|[f\u0254o]}}.\n**The other pre-{{IPA|/l/}} neutralisation which all investigators agree on is that of {{IPA|/\u00e6~e\u026a~a\u028a/}}. Thus, ''Sal'' and ''sale'' can be merged as {{IPA|[s\u00e6\u0264]}}, ''fail'' and ''fowl'' as {{IPA|[f\u00e6\u0264]}}, and ''Val'', ''vale''-''veil'' and ''vowel'' as {{IPA|[v\u00e6\u0264]}}. The typical pronunciation of ''railway'' is {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0279\u00e6\u028aw\u00e6\u026a]}}.\n**According to Siversten, {{IPA|/\u0251\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/a\u026a/}} can also join in this neutralisation. They may on the one hand neutralise with respect to one another, so that ''snarl'' and ''smile'' rhyme, both ending {{IPA|[-\u0251\u0264]}}, and ''Child's Hill'' is in danger of being mistaken for ''Charles Hill''; or they may go further into a fivefold neutralisation with the one just mentioned, so that ''pal'', ''pale'', ''foul'', ''snarl'' and ''pile'' all end in {{IPA|[-\u00e6\u0264]}}. But these developments are evidently restricted to broad cockney, not being found in London speech in general.\n**A neutralisation discussed by Beaken (1971) and Bowyer (1973), but ignored by Siversten (1960), is that of {{IPA|/\u0252~\u0259\u028a~\u028c/}}. It leads to the possibility of ''doll'', ''dole'' and ''dull'' becoming homophonous as {{IPA|[d\u0252\u028a]}} or {{IPA|[da\u0320\u0264]}}. Wells' impression is that the ''doll''-''dole'' neutralisation is rather widespread in London, but that involving ''dull'' less so.\n**One further possible neutralisation in the environment of a following non-prevocalic {{IPA|/l/}} is that of {{IPA|/\u025b/}} and {{IPA|/\u025c\u02d0/}}, so that ''well'' and ''whirl'' become homophonous as {{IPA|[w\u025b\u028a]}}.\n*Cockney has been occasionally described as replacing {{IPA|/\u0279/}} with {{IPA|/w/}}. For example, ''thwee'' (or ''fwee'') instead of ''three'', ''fwasty'' instead of ''frosty''. Peter Wright, a [[Survey of English Dialects]] fieldworker, concluded that this was not a universal feature of cockneys but that it was more common to hear this in the London area than anywhere else in Britain.{{Sfnp|Wright|1981|p=135}} This description may also be a result of mishearing the [[R-labialisation|labiodental R]] as {{IPA|/w/}}, when it is still a distinct phoneme in cockney.\n*An unstressed final ''-ow'' may be pronounced {{IPAblink|\u0259}}. In broad cockney this can be lowered to {{IPAblink|\u0250}}.<ref name=\"ic.arizona.edu\" />{{Sfnp|Wells|1982|p=305}} This is common to most traditional, Southern English dialects except for those in the [[West Country]].{{Sfnp|Wright|1981|p=134}}\n*Grammatical features:<ref name=\"bucknell\" />\n**Use of ''me'' instead of ''my'', for example, \"At's me book you got 'ere\".

For example, in 1909 the Conference on the Teaching of English in London Elementary Schools issued by the [[London County Council]], stating that \"the Cockney mode of speech, with its unpleasant twang, is a modern corruption without legitimate credentials, and is unworthy of being the speech of any person in the capital city of the [[British Empire|Empire]]\".<ref name=\"Attitudes towards Cockney\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.humnet.unipi.it/slifo/articolosantipolo.pdf |title=5 |date= |access-date=1 October 2010}}</ref> Others defended the language variety: \"The London dialect is really, especially on the South side of the Thames, a perfectly legitimate and responsible child of the old kentish tongue [...] the dialect of London North of the Thames has been shown to be one of the many varieties of the Midland or Mercian dialect, flavoured by the East Anglian variety of the same speech\".<ref name=\"Attitudes towards Cockney\" /> Since then, the cockney accent has been more accepted as an alternative form of the English language rather than an inferior one. In the 1950s, the only accent to be heard on the [[BBC]] (except in entertainment programmes such as ''[[The Sooty Show]]'') was [[Received Pronunciation|RP]], whereas nowadays many different accents, including cockney or accents heavily influenced by it, can be heard on the BBC.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/voices/yourvoice/rpandbbc3.shtml#A |title=BBC English |publisher=BBC English |date= |access-date=1 October 2010}}</ref> In a survey of 2,000 people conducted by [[Coolbrands]] in the autumn of 2008, cockney was voted equal fourth [[coolest]] accent in Britain with 7% of the votes, while [[Received Pronunciation|The Queen's English]] was considered the coolest, with 20% of the votes.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/3073282/Brummie-accent-voted-least-cool-in-Britain.html|title=RP still most popular accent |publisher=telegraph.co.uk |date = September 2008|access-date=18 March 2009 | location=London | first=Chris | last=Irvine}}</ref> [[Brummie]] was voted least popular, receiving just 2%.

Originally, when London consisted of little more than the [[City of London|City]], the term applied to all Londoners, but as the city grew this was replaced by less universal definitions. A common view is that in order to be a cockney, one must have been born within earshot of Bow Bells, the bells of [[St Mary-le-Bow]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stmarylebow.co.uk/#/bow-bells/4535373284|title=St Mary-le-Bow|website=www.stmarylebow.co.uk}}</ref> which were cast at the [[Whitechapel Bell Foundry]]. However, the church of St Mary-le-Bow was destroyed in 1666 by the [[Great Fire of London]] and rebuilt by [[Sir Christopher Wren]]. Although the bells were destroyed again in 1941 in [[the Blitz]], they had fallen silent on 13 June 1940 as part of the [[British anti-invasion preparations of World War II]]. Before they were replaced in 1961, there was a period when, by the \"within earshot\" definition, no \"Bow Bell\" cockneys could be born.<ref>J. Swinnerton, ''The London Companion'' (Robson, 2004), p. 21.</ref> The use of such a literal definition produces other problems, since the area around the church is no longer residential and the noise of the area makes it unlikely that many people would now be born within earshot of the bells,{{Sfnp|Wright|1981|p=11}} Similarly, there were in the past, several hospitals in audible range; but now there is just the [[Royal London Hospital]] in [[Whitechapel]], with home births now uncommon.\n\nThe terms \u201cEast End of London\u201d and \u201cwithin the sound of bow bells\u201d are used interchangeably, and the bells are a symbol of East End identity. However the Bow Bells definition reflects the earlier definition of Cockney as relating to all Londoners (at a time when London barely extended beyond the [[City of London|square mile]]. The use of the term to describe all [[London]]ers generally, however, survived into the 19th century<ref name=\"hott\" /> before becoming restricted to the working class and their particular accent. The term is now used loosely to describe all [[East End of London|East Londoners]], irrespective of their speech.\n\nA study was carried out by the [[City of London|City]] in 2000 to see how far away Bow Bells could be heard,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://public.oed.com/aspects-of-english/english-in-use/cockney/|title=Cockney - Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=}}</ref> and it was estimated that the bells would have been heard up to six miles to the east, five miles to the north, three miles to the south, and four miles to the west. According to the legend of [[Dick Whittington]] the bells could once be heard from as far away as the Highgate [[Archway, London|Archway]] (4.5 miles north). Based on a definition of the bells audible range, all East Enders are cockneys, but not all cockneys are East Enders; though whereas an East Ender would be likely to proudly claim that entitlement, a resident of west, north or south London would be less likely to. The traditional core districts of the [[East End of London|East End]] are [[Bethnal Green]], [[Whitechapel]], [[Spitalfields]], [[Stepney]], [[Wapping]], [[Limehouse]], [[Poplar, London|Poplar]], [[Haggerston]], [[Aldgate]], [[Shoreditch]], [[Millwall]], [[Cubitt Town]], [[Hackney Central|Hackney]], [[Hoxton]], [[Bow, London|Bow]] and [[Mile End]]. The area north of the Thames gradually expanded to include [[East Ham]], [[Stratford, London|Stratford]], [[Leyton]], [[West Ham]] and [[Plaistow, Newham|Plaistow]] as more land was built upon.\n\nWriting in 1981, the dialectologist Peter Wright identified the building of the [[Becontree]] estate near [[Dagenham]] in Essex as influential in the spread of cockney dialect. This very large estate was built by the [[Corporation of London]] to house poor residents of London's East End on what was previously a rural area of Essex, and the residents generally kept their native cockney dialect rather than adopt an Essex dialect.{{Sfnp|Wright|1981|p=146}} Wright also reports that cockney dialect spread along the main railway routes to towns in the surrounding counties as early as 1923, and cockney then spread further after World War II as many refugees left London owing to the bombing, but continued to speak cockney in their new homes.{{Sfnp|Wright|1981|p=147}}\n\n== Notable cockneys ==<!-- New links in alphabetical order please -->\n<!-- *** ATTENTION*** Please cite entries with a reliable source for a person being explicitly known as, or calling themselves, a Cockney -->\n{{More citations needed|section|date=December 2018}}\n*[[Danny Baker]] (broadcaster, born in [[Deptford]])\n*[[Michael Caine]] (actor, born as Maurice Joseph Micklewhite, Jr., 14 March 1933, in [[Rotherhithe]])<ref>{{Cite news|title=Screening Room Special: Michael Caine|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/Movies/09/30/caine.october/|agency=CNN|issue=29 October 2007|date=25 June 2015}}</ref>\n*[[Alfie Bass]] actor from [[Bethnal Green]].\n*[[Charlie Chaplin]] (comic actor, filmmaker, and composer, 16 April 1889, born in [[Walworth, London]])\n*[[Roger Daltrey]] (singer, actor and vocalist of [[The Who]], 1 March 1944, born in [[East Acton]], [[London]])\n*[[Alan Ford (actor)|Alan Ford]], (actor, born in [[Walworth]])\n*[[Steve Harley]] (musician, frontman of the band Cockney Rebel, born in [[Deptford]])\n*[[Hoxton Tom McCourt]], musician, face, born in [[Shoreditch]] and lived in [[Hoxton]]\n*[[Lenny McLean]], bare knuckle/unlicensed boxer, actor, born in Hoxton\n*[[Claude Rains]], the actor born in [[Camberwell]] in 1889 became famous after abandoning his heavy cockney accent and developing a unique [[Mid-Atlantic accent]] described as \"half American, half English and a little Cockney thrown in\".\n*[[Harry Redknapp]] (former footballer and manager born in [[Poplar, London|Poplar]])\n*[[Tommy Steele]] (1950s pop and film artist, born in [[Bermondsey]])\n*[[Kray twins]], criminals, born in [[Hoxton]] and lived in [[Bethnal Green]]\n*[[Barbara Windsor]] actress born in [[Shoreditch]], [[London]]\n*[[Ray Winstone]] (actor, born in [[Homerton]])<ref>{{Cite news|title=Ray Winstone: Me cockney accent won the role|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/news/ray-winstone-me-cockney-accent-won-the-role-226465/|work=WhatsonTV|issue=13 November 2016|access-date=17 January 2017}}</ref>\n*[[Arthur Smith (comedian)|Arthur Smith]] (comedian from [[Bermondsey]])\n*[[Micky Flanagan]] (comedian from [[Whitechapel]])\n*[[Eric Bristow]] (darts champion born in Hackney.

''Like'' and ''light'' can be homophones. \"Clapham\" can be said as ''Cla'am'' (i. e., {{IPA|[\u02c8kl\u0325\u025b\u0294m\u0329]}}).{{Sfnp|Wright|1981|pp=136\u2013137}} {{IPA|/t/}} may also be [[flapping|flapped]] intervocalically, e.g. ''utter'' {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0250\u027e\u0259]}}. London {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} are often aspirated in intervocalic and final environments, e.g., ''upper'' {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0250p\u02b0\u0259]}}, ''utter'' {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0250t\u02b0\u0259]}}, ''rocker'' {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0279\u0252k\u02b0\u0259]}}, ''up'' {{IPA|[\u0250\u0294p\u02b0]}}, ''out'' {{IPA|[\u00e6\u0259\u032f\u0294t\u02b0]}}, ''rock'' {{IPA|[\u0279\u0252\u0294k\u02b0]}}, where [[Received Pronunciation|RP]] is traditionally described as having the unaspirated variants. Also, in broad cockney at least, the degree of aspiration is typically greater than in RP, and may often also involve some degree of affrication {{IPA|[p\u1db2\u02b0, t\u02e2\u02b0, k\u02e3\u02b0]}}.

These variants are retained when the addition of a suffix turns the dark l [[Alveolar lateral approximant|clear]]. Thus a phonemic split has occurred in London English, exemplified by the minimal pair ''wholly'' {{IPA|[\u02c8h\u0252\u028ali]}} vs. ''holy'' {{IPA|[\u02c8h\u0250\u0264\u0308li]}}.

All this reinforces the phonemic nature of the opposition and increases its functional load. It is now well-established in all kinds of London-flavoured accents, from broad cockney to near-RP.{{Sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=312\u2013313}}\n** {{IPA|/\u028a/}} in some words (particularly ''good''){{Sfnp|Mott|2011|p=75}} is central {{IPAblink|\u028a\u0308}}.{{Sfnp|Mott|2012|p=75}} In other cases, it is near-close near-back {{IPAblink|\u028a}}, as in traditional RP.{{Sfnp|Mott|2012|p=75}}\n*[[L-vocalisation|Vocalisation of dark L]], hence {{IPA|[\u02c8m\u026aow\u0254\u02d0]}} for [[Millwall]]. The actual realisation of a vocalised {{IPA|/l/}} is influenced by surrounding vowels and it may be realised as {{IPA|[u]}}, {{IPA|[\u028a]}}, {{IPA|[o]}} or {{IPA|[\u0264]}}. It is also transcribed as a [[semivowel]] {{IPA|[w]}} by some linguists, e.g., Coggle and Rosewarne.{{Sfnp|Sivertsen|1960|p=132}} However, according to {{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996}}, the vocalised dark l is sometimes an unoccluded lateral approximant, which differs from the RP {{IPA|[\u026b]}} only by the lack of the alveolar contact.{{Sfnp|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=193}} Relatedly, there are many possible vowel neutralisations and absorptions in the context of a following dark L ({{IPA|[\u026b]}}) or its vocalised version; these include:{{Sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=313\u2013317}}\n**In broad cockney, and to some extent in general popular London speech, a vocalised {{IPA|/l/}} is entirely absorbed by a preceding {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}}: e.g., ''salt'' and ''sort'' become homophones (although the contemporary pronunciation of ''salt'' {{IPA|/s\u0252lt/}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/sounds/activities/phonological-change/ |title=Phonological change in spoken English |publisher=Bl.uk |date=12 March 2007 |access-date=1 October 2010}}</ref> would prevent this from happening), and likewise ''fault''-''fought''-''fort'', ''pause''-''Paul's'', ''Morden''-''Malden'', ''water''-''Walter''. Sometimes such pairs are kept apart, in more deliberate speech at least, by a kind of length difference: {{IPA|[\u02c8m\u0254\u028adn\u0329]}} ''Morden'' vs. {{IPA|[\u02c8m\u0254\u028a\u02d0dn\u0329]}} ''Malden''.\n**A preceding {{IPA|/\u0259/}} is also fully absorbed into vocalised {{IPA|/l/}}. The reflexes of earlier {{IPA|/\u0259l/}} and earlier {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0(l)/}} are thus phonetically similar or identical; speakers are usually ready to treat them as the same phoneme. Thus ''awful'' can best be regarded as containing two occurrences of the same vowel, {{IPA|/\u02c8\u0254\u02d0f\u0254\u02d0/}}. The difference between ''musical'' and ''music-hall'', in an ''H''-dropping broad cockney, is thus nothing more than a matter of stress and perhaps syllable boundaries.\n**With the remaining vowels a vocalised {{IPA|/l/}} is not absorbed, but remains phonetically present as a back vocoid in such a way that {{IPA|/Vl/}} and {{IPA|/V/}} are kept distinct.\n**The clearest and best-established neutralisations are those of {{IPA|/\u026a~i\u02d0~\u026a\u0259/}} and {{IPA|/\u028a~u\u02d0~\u028a\u0259/}}. Thus ''rill'', ''reel'' and ''real'' fall together in cockney as {{IPA|[\u0279\u026a\u0264]}}; while ''full'' and ''fool'' are {{IPA|[fo\u028a~f\u028au]}} and may rhyme with ''cruel'' {{IPA|[\u02c8k\u02b0\u0279\u028au]}}. Before clear (i.e., prevocalic) {{IPA|/l/}} the neutralisations do not usually apply, thus {{IPA|[\u02c8s\u026ali]}} ''silly'' but {{IPA|[\u02c8s\u026ail\u026an]}} ''ceiling''-''sealing'', {{IPA|[\u02c8f\u028ali]}} ''fully'' but {{IPA|[\u02c8f\u028aul\u026an]}} ''fooling''.\n**In some broader types of cockney, the neutralisation of {{IPA|/\u028a~u\u02d0~\u028a\u0259/}} before non-prevocalic {{IPA|/l/}} may also involve {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}}, so that ''fall'' becomes homophonous with ''full'' and ''fool'' {{IPA|[f\u0254o]}}.\n**The other pre-{{IPA|/l/}} neutralisation which all investigators agree on is that of {{IPA|/\u00e6~e\u026a~a\u028a/}}. Thus, ''Sal'' and ''sale'' can be merged as {{IPA|[s\u00e6\u0264]}}, ''fail'' and ''fowl'' as {{IPA|[f\u00e6\u0264]}}, and ''Val'', ''vale''-''veil'' and ''vowel'' as {{IPA|[v\u00e6\u0264]}}. The typical pronunciation of ''railway'' is {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0279\u00e6\u028aw\u00e6\u026a]}}.\n**According to Siversten, {{IPA|/\u0251\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/a\u026a/}} can also join in this neutralisation. They may on the one hand neutralise with respect to one another, so that ''snarl'' and ''smile'' rhyme, both ending {{IPA|[-\u0251\u0264]}}, and ''Child's Hill'' is in danger of being mistaken for ''Charles Hill''; or they may go further into a fivefold neutralisation with the one just mentioned, so that ''pal'', ''pale'', ''foul'', ''snarl'' and ''pile'' all end in {{IPA|[-\u00e6\u0264]}}. But these developments are evidently restricted to broad cockney, not being found in London speech in general.\n**A neutralisation discussed by Beaken (1971) and Bowyer (1973), but ignored by Siversten (1960), is that of {{IPA|/\u0252~\u0259\u028a~\u028c/}}. It leads to the possibility of ''doll'', ''dole'' and ''dull'' becoming homophonous as {{IPA|[d\u0252\u028a]}} or {{IPA|[da\u0320\u0264]}}. Wells' impression is that the ''doll''-''dole'' neutralisation is rather widespread in London, but that involving ''dull'' less so.\n**One further possible neutralisation in the environment of a following non-prevocalic {{IPA|/l/}} is that of {{IPA|/\u025b/}} and {{IPA|/\u025c\u02d0/}}, so that ''well'' and ''whirl'' become homophonous as {{IPA|[w\u025b\u028a]}}.\n*Cockney has been occasionally described as replacing {{IPA|/\u0279/}} with {{IPA|/w/}}. For example, ''thwee'' (or ''fwee'') instead of ''three'', ''fwasty'' instead of ''frosty''. Peter Wright, a [[Survey of English Dialects]] fieldworker, concluded that this was not a universal feature of cockneys but that it was more common to hear this in the London area than anywhere else in Britain.{{Sfnp|Wright|1981|p=135}} This description may also be a result of mishearing the [[R-labialisation|labiodental R]] as {{IPA|/w/}}, when it is still a distinct phoneme in cockney.\n*An unstressed final ''-ow'' may be pronounced {{IPAblink|\u0259}}.

For example, in 1909 the Conference on the Teaching of English in London Elementary Schools issued by the [[London County Council]], stating that \"the Cockney mode of speech, with its unpleasant twang, is a modern corruption without legitimate credentials, and is unworthy of being the speech of any person in the capital city of the [[British Empire|Empire]]\".<ref name=\"Attitudes towards Cockney\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.humnet.unipi.it/slifo/articolosantipolo.pdf |title=5 |date= |access-date=1 October 2010}}</ref> Others defended the language variety: \"The London dialect is really, especially on the South side of the Thames, a perfectly legitimate and responsible child of the old kentish tongue [...] the dialect of London North of the Thames has been shown to be one of the many varieties of the Midland or Mercian dialect, flavoured by the East Anglian variety of the same speech\".<ref name=\"Attitudes towards Cockney\" /> Since then, the cockney accent has been more accepted as an alternative form of the English language rather than an inferior one. In the 1950s, the only accent to be heard on the [[BBC]] (except in entertainment programmes such as ''[[The Sooty Show]]'') was [[Received Pronunciation|RP]], whereas nowadays many different accents, including cockney or accents heavily influenced by it, can be heard on the BBC.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/voices/yourvoice/rpandbbc3.shtml#A |title=BBC English |publisher=BBC English |date= |access-date=1 October 2010}}</ref> In a survey of 2,000 people conducted by [[Coolbrands]] in the autumn of 2008, cockney was voted equal fourth [[coolest]] accent in Britain with 7% of the votes, while [[Received Pronunciation|The Queen's English]] was considered the coolest, with 20% of the votes.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/3073282/Brummie-accent-voted-least-cool-in-Britain.html|title=RP still most popular accent |publisher=telegraph.co.uk |date = September 2008|access-date=18 March 2009 | location=London | first=Chris | last=Irvine}}</ref> [[Brummie]] was voted least popular, receiving just 2%.

The term stands for '''rep'''eated '''unit''' and was coined in 1966 by [[Albert H. Beiler]] in his book ''Recreations in the Theory of Numbers''.{{refn|group=note|Albert H. Beiler coined the term \u201crepunit number\u201d as follows:<blockquote>A number which consists of a repeated of a single digit is sometimes called a monodigit number, and for convenience the author has used the term \u201crepunit number\u201d (repeated unit) to represent monodigit numbers consisting solely of the digit 1.<ref>{{Harvnb|Beiler|2013|pp=83}}</ref></blockquote>}}<!--- Original publication was 1964; did he coin repunit in that edition? or was this added in 1966? --->\n\nA '''repunit prime''' is a repunit that is also a [[prime number]]. Primes that are repunits in [[Binary number|base-2]] are [[Mersenne prime]]s.\n\n== Definition ==\n\nThe base-''b'' repunits are defined as (this ''b'' can be either positive or negative)\n:<math>R_n^{(b)}\\equiv 1 + b + b^2 + \\cdots + b^{n-1} = {b^n-1\\over{b-1}}\\qquad\\mbox{for }|b|\\ge2, n\\ge1.</math>\nThus, the number ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> consists of ''n'' copies of the digit 1 in base-''b'' representation. The first two repunits base-''b'' for ''n''&thinsp;=&thinsp;1 and ''n''&thinsp;=&thinsp;2 are \n:<math>R_1^{(b)}={b-1\\over{b-1}}= 1 \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad R_2^{(b)}={b^2-1\\over{b-1}}= b+1\\qquad\\text{for}\\ |b|\\ge2.</math>\n\nIn particular, the ''[[decimal]] (base-''10'') repunits'' that are often referred to as simply ''repunits'' are defined as\n:<math>R_n \\equiv R_n^{(10)} = {10^n-1\\over{10-1}} = {10^n-1\\over9}\\qquad\\mbox{for } n \\ge 1.</math>\nThus, the number ''R''<sub>''n''</sub> = ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(10)</sup> consists of ''n'' copies of the digit 1 in base 10 representation. The sequence of repunits base-10 starts with\n: [[1 (number)|1]], [[11 (number)|11]], [[111 (number)|111]], 1111, 11111, 111111, ... {{OEIS|A002275}}.\n\nSimilarly, the repunits base-2 are defined as\n:<math>R_n^{(2)} = {2^n-1\\over{2-1}} = {2^n-1}\\qquad\\mbox{for }n \\ge 1.</math>\nThus, the number ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(2)</sup> consists of ''n'' copies of the digit 1 in base-2 representation. In fact, the base-2 repunits are the well-known [[Mersenne prime|Mersenne number]]s ''M''<sub>''n''</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1, they start with\n:1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, 127, 255, 511, 1023, 2047, 4095, 8191, 16383, 32767, 65535, ... {{OEIS|id=A000225}}.\n\n== Properties ==\n* Any repunit in any base having a composite number of digits is necessarily composite.  Only repunits (in any base) having a prime number of digits might be prime. This is a necessary but not sufficient condition.  For example,\n*: ''R''<sub>35</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> = {{loop|35|1}} = 11111 \u00d7 1000010000100001000010000100001 = 1111111 \u00d7 10000001000000100000010000001,\n:since 35 = 7 \u00d7 5 = 5 \u00d7 7.  This repunit factorization does not depend on the base-''b'' in which the repunit is expressed.\n* If ''p'' is an odd prime, then every prime ''q'' that divides ''R''<sub>''p''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> must be either 1 plus a multiple of 2''p,'' or a factor of ''b'' \u2212 1. For example, a prime factor of ''R''<sub>29</sub> is 62003 = 1 + 2\u00b729\u00b71069. The reason is that the prime ''p'' is the smallest exponent greater than 1 such that ''q'' divides ''b<sup>p</sup>'' \u2212 1, because ''p'' is prime. Therefore, unless ''q'' divides ''b'' \u2212 1, [[Carmichael function#Order of elements modulo n|''p'' divides the Carmichael function]] of ''q'', which is even and equal to ''q'' \u2212 1. \n*Any positive multiple of the repunit ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> contains at least ''n'' nonzero digits in base-''b''.\n* Any number ''x'' is a two-digit repunit in base x \u2212 1.\n* The only known numbers that are repunits with at least 3 digits in more than one base simultaneously are 31 (111 in base-5, 11111 in base-2) and 8191 (111 in base-90, 1111111111111 in base-2). The [[Goormaghtigh conjecture]] says there are only these two cases.\n* Using the [[pigeon-hole principle]] it can be easily shown that for each ''n'' and ''b'' such that ''n''  and ''b'' are [[Coprime integers|relatively prime]] there exists a repunit in base-''b'' that is a multiple of ''n''. To see this consider repunits ''R''<sub>1</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>,...,''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>. Because there are ''n'' repunits but only ''n''\u22121 non-zero residues modulo ''n'' there exist two repunits ''R''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> and ''R''<sub>''j''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> with 1\u2264''i''<''j''\u2264''n'' such that ''R''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> and ''R''<sub>''j''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> have the same residue modulo ''n''. It follows that ''R''<sub>''j''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> \u2212 ''R''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> has residue 0 modulo ''n'', i.e. is divisible by ''n''. ''R''<sub>''j''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> \u2212 ''R''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> consists of ''j'' \u2212 ''i'' ones followed by ''i'' zeroes. Thus, ''R''<sub>''j''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> \u2212 ''R''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> = ''R''<sub>''j''\u2212''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>  x ''b''<sup>''i''</sup> . Since ''n'' divides the left-hand side it also divides the right-hand side and since ''n'' and ''b'' are relatively prime ''n'' must divide ''R''<sub>''j''\u2212''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>.\n* The [[Feit\u2013Thompson conjecture]] is that ''R''<sub>''q''</sub><sup>(''p'')</sup> never divides ''R''<sub>''p''</sub><sup>(''q'')</sup> for two distinct primes ''p'' and ''q''.\n* Using the [[Euclidean Algorithm]] for repunits definition: ''R''<sub>1</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> = 1; ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> = ''R''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> x ''b'' + 1, any consecutive repunits ''R''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> and ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> are relatively prime in any base-''b'' for any ''n''.\n* If ''m'' and ''n'' have a common divisor ''d'', ''R''<sub>''m''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> and ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> have the common divisor ''R''<sub>''d''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> in any base-''b'' for any ''m'' and ''n''. That is, the repunits of a fixed base form a [[Divisibility sequence|strong divisibility sequence]]. As a consequence, If ''m'' and ''n'' are relatively prime, ''R''<sub>''m''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> and ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> are relatively prime. The Euclidean Algorithm is based on ''gcd''(''m'', ''n'') = ''gcd''(''m'' \u2212 ''n'', ''n'') for ''m'' > ''n''. Similarly, using ''R''<sub>''m''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> \u2212 ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> \u00d7 ''b''<sup>''m''\u2212''n''</sup> = ''R''<sub>''m''\u2212''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>, it can be easily shown that ''gcd''(''R''<sub>''m''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>, ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>) = ''gcd''(''R''<sub>''m''\u2212''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>, ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>) for ''m'' > ''n''. Therefore if ''gcd''(''m'', ''n'') = ''d'', then ''gcd''(''R''<sub>''m''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>, ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>) = ''R<sub>d</sub>''<sup>(''b'')</sup>. \n\n== Factorization of decimal repunits ==\n\n(Prime factors colored {{color|red|red}} means \"new factors\", i. e. the prime factor divides ''R''<sub>''n''</sub> but does not divide ''R''<sub>''k''</sub> for all ''k'' < ''n'') {{OEIS|id=A102380}}<ref>For more information, see [http://stdkmd.net/nrr/repunit/ Factorization of repunit numbers].</ref>\n\n{|\n|-\n||\n{|\n|-\n|''R''<sub>1</sub> =||1\n|-\n|''R''<sub>2</sub> =||{{color|red|11}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>3</sub> =||{{color|red|3}} \u00b7 {{color|red|37}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>4</sub> =||11 \u00b7 {{color|red|101}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>5</sub> =||{{color|red|41}} \u00b7 {{color|red|271}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>6</sub> =||3 \u00b7 {{color|red|7}} \u00b7 11 \u00b7 {{color|red|13}} \u00b7 37\n|-\n|''R''<sub>7</sub> =||{{color|red|239}} \u00b7 {{color|red|4649}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>8</sub> =||11 \u00b7 {{color|red|73}} \u00b7 101 \u00b7 {{color|red|137}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>9</sub> =||3<sup>2</sup> \u00b7 37 \u00b7 {{color|red|333667}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>10</sub> =||11 \u00b7 41 \u00b7 271 \u00b7 {{color|red|9091}}\n|}\n||\n{|\n|-\n|''R''<sub>11</sub> =||{{color|red|21649}} \u00b7 {{color|red|513239}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>12</sub> =||3 \u00b7 7 \u00b7 11 \u00b7 13 \u00b7 37 \u00b7 101 \u00b7 {{color|red|9901}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>13</sub> =||{{color|red|53}} \u00b7 {{color|red|79}} \u00b7 {{color|red|265371653}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>14</sub> =||11 \u00b7 239 \u00b7 4649 \u00b7 {{color|red|909091}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>15</sub> =||3 \u00b7 {{color|red|31}} \u00b7 37 \u00b7 41 \u00b7 271 \u00b7 {{color|red|2906161}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>16</sub> =||11 \u00b7 {{color|red|17}} \u00b7 73 \u00b7 101 \u00b7 137 \u00b7 {{color|red|5882353}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>17</sub> =||{{color|red|2071723}} \u00b7 {{color|red|5363222357}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>18</sub> =||3<sup>2</sup> \u00b7 7 \u00b7 11 \u00b7 13 \u00b7 {{color|red|19}} \u00b7 37 \u00b7 {{color|red|52579}} \u00b7 333667\n|-\n|''R''<sub>19</sub> =||{{color|red|{{loop|19|1}}}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>20</sub> =||11 \u00b7 41 \u00b7 101 \u00b7 271 \u00b7 {{color|red|3541}} \u00b7 9091 \u00b7 {{color|red|27961}}\n|}\n||\n{|\n|-\n|''R''<sub>21</sub> =||3 \u00b7 37 \u00b7 {{color|red|43}} \u00b7 239 \u00b7 {{color|red|1933}} \u00b7 4649 \u00b7 {{color|red|10838689}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>22</sub> =||11<sup>2</sup> \u00b7 {{color|red|23}} \u00b7 {{color|red|4093}} \u00b7 {{color|red|8779}} \u00b7 21649 \u00b7 513239\n|-\n|''R''<sub>23</sub> =||{{color|red|{{loop|23|1}}}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>24</sub> =||3 \u00b7 7 \u00b7 11 \u00b7 13 \u00b7 37 \u00b7 73 \u00b7 101 \u00b7 137 \u00b7 9901 \u00b7 {{color|red|99990001}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>25</sub> =||41 \u00b7 271 \u00b7 {{color|red|21401}} \u00b7 {{color|red|25601}} \u00b7 {{color|red|182521213001}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>26</sub> =||11 \u00b7 53 \u00b7 79 \u00b7 {{color|red|859}} \u00b7 265371653 \u00b7 {{color|red|1058313049}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>27</sub> =||3<sup>3</sup> \u00b7 37 \u00b7 {{color|red|757}} \u00b7 333667 \u00b7 {{color|red|440334654777631}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>28</sub> =||11 \u00b7 {{color|red|29}} \u00b7 101 \u00b7 239 \u00b7 {{color|red|281}} \u00b7 4649 \u00b7 909091 \u00b7 {{color|red|121499449}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>29</sub> =||{{color|red|3191}} \u00b7 {{color|red|16763}} \u00b7 {{color|red|43037}} \u00b7 {{color|red|62003}} \u00b7 {{color|red|77843839397}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>30</sub> =||3 \u00b7 7 \u00b7 11 \u00b7 13 \u00b7 31 \u00b7 37 \u00b7 41 \u00b7 {{color|red|211}} \u00b7 {{color|red|241}} \u00b7 271 \u00b7 {{color|red|2161}} \u00b7 9091 \u00b7 2906161\n|}\n|}\n\nSmallest prime factor of ''R''<sub>''n''</sub> for ''n'' > 1 are\n:11, 3, 11, 41, 3, 239, 11, 3, 11, 21649, 3, 53, 11, 3, 11, 2071723, 3, 1111111111111111111, 11, 3, 11, 11111111111111111111111, 3, 41, 11, 3, 11, 3191, 3, 2791, 11, 3, 11, 41, 3, 2028119, 11, 3, 11, 83, 3, 173, 11, 3, 11, 35121409, 3, 239, 11, ... {{OEIS|id=A067063}}\n\n==Repunit primes==\nThe definition of repunits was motivated by recreational mathematicians looking for [[integer factorization|prime factors]] of such numbers.\n\nIt is easy to show that if ''n'' is divisible by ''a'', then ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> is divisible by ''R''<sub>''a''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>:\n\n:<math>R_n^{(b)}=\\frac{1}{b-1}\\prod_{d|n}\\Phi_d(b),</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\Phi_d(x)</math> is the <math>d^\\mathrm{th}</math> [[cyclotomic polynomial]] and ''d'' ranges over the divisors of ''n''.

Another special situation is ''b'' = \u22124''k''<sup>4</sup>, with ''k'' positive integer, which has the [[aurifeuillean factorization]], for example, ''b'' = \u22124 (with ''k'' = 1, then ''R<sub>2</sub>'' and ''R<sub>3</sub>'' are primes), and ''b'' = \u221264, \u2212324, \u22121024, \u22122500, \u22125184, ... (with ''k'' = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...), then no base-''b'' repunit prime exists. It is also conjectured that when ''b'' is neither a perfect power nor \u22124''k''<sup>4</sup> with ''k'' positive integer, then there are infinity many base-''b'' repunit primes.\n\n=== The generalized repunit conjecture ===\n\nA conjecture related to the generalized repunit primes:<ref>[http://primes.utm.edu/mersenne/heuristic.html Deriving the Wagstaff Mersenne Conjecture]</ref><ref>[https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind0906&L=NMBRTHRY&P=R295&1=NMBRTHRY&9=A&J=on&d=No+Match%3BMatch%3BMatches&z=4 Generalized Repunit Conjecture]</ref> (the conjecture predicts where is the next generalized Mersenne prime, if the conjecture is true, then there are infinitely many repunit primes for all bases <math>b</math>)\n\nFor any integer <math>b</math>, which satisfies the conditions:\n\n# <math>|b|>1</math>.\n# <math>b</math> is not a [[perfect power]].

Tables of the period of reciprocal of primes up to 60,000 had been published by 1860 and permitted the [[integer factorization|factorization]] by such mathematicians as Reuschle of all repunits up to ''R<sub>16</sub>'' and many larger ones. By 1880, even ''R<sub>17</sub>'' to ''R<sub>36</sub>'' had been factored<ref name=\"Dickson1999\" /> and it is curious that, though [[\u00c9douard Lucas]] showed no prime below three million had period [[19 (number)|nineteen]], there was no attempt to test any repunit for primality until early in the twentieth century. The American mathematician Oscar Hoppe proved ''R<sub>19</sub>'' to be prime in 1916<ref>{{Harvnb|Francis|1988|pp=240\u2013246}}</ref> and Lehmer and Kraitchik independently found ''R<sub>23</sub>'' to be prime in 1929.\n\nFurther advances in the study of repunits did not occur until the 1960s, when computers allowed many new factors of repunits to be found and the gaps in earlier tables of prime periods corrected. ''R<sub>317</sub>'' was found to be a [[probable prime]] circa 1966 and was proved prime eleven years later, when ''R<sub>1031</sub>'' was shown to be the only further possible prime repunit with fewer than ten thousand digits. It was proven prime in 1986, but searches for further prime repunits in the following decade consistently failed. However, there was a major side-development in the field of generalized repunits, which produced a large number of new primes and probable primes.\n\nSince 1999, four further probably prime repunits have been found, but it is unlikely that any of them will be proven prime in the foreseeable future because of their huge size.\n\nThe [[Cunningham project]] endeavours to document the integer factorizations of (among other numbers) the repunits to base 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, and 12.\n\n== Demlo numbers ==\n[[D. R. Kaprekar]] has defined Demlo numbers as concatenation of a left, middle and right part, where the left and right part must be of the same length (up to a possible leading zero to the left) and must add up to a repdigit number, and the middle part may contain any additional number of this repeated digit.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kaprekar|1938}}, {{Harvnb|Gunjikar and Kaprekar|1939}}</ref> \nThey are named after [[Demlo]] railway station 30 miles from Bombay on the then [[G.I.P.

The term stands for '''rep'''eated '''unit''' and was coined in 1966 by [[Albert H. Beiler]] in his book ''Recreations in the Theory of Numbers''.{{refn|group=note|Albert H. Beiler coined the term \u201crepunit number\u201d as follows:<blockquote>A number which consists of a repeated of a single digit is sometimes called a monodigit number, and for convenience the author has used the term \u201crepunit number\u201d (repeated unit) to represent monodigit numbers consisting solely of the digit 1.<ref>{{Harvnb|Beiler|2013|pp=83}}</ref></blockquote>}}<!--- Original publication was 1964; did he coin repunit in that edition? or was this added in 1966? --->\n\nA '''repunit prime''' is a repunit that is also a [[prime number]]. Primes that are repunits in [[Binary number|base-2]] are [[Mersenne prime]]s.\n\n== Definition ==\n\nThe base-''b'' repunits are defined as (this ''b'' can be either positive or negative)\n:<math>R_n^{(b)}\\equiv 1 + b + b^2 + \\cdots + b^{n-1} = {b^n-1\\over{b-1}}\\qquad\\mbox{for }|b|\\ge2, n\\ge1.</math>\nThus, the number ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> consists of ''n'' copies of the digit 1 in base-''b'' representation. The first two repunits base-''b'' for ''n''=1 and ''n''=2 are \n:<math>R_1^{(b)}={b-1\\over{b-1}}= 1 \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad R_2^{(b)}={b^2-1\\over{b-1}}= b+1\\qquad\\text{for}\\ |b|\\ge2.</math>\n\nIn particular, the ''[[decimal]] (base-''10'') repunits'' that are often referred to as simply ''repunits'' are defined as\n:<math>R_n\\equiv R_n^{(10)} = {10^n-1\\over{10-1}} = {10^n-1\\over9}\\qquad\\mbox{for } n \\ge 1.</math>\nThus, the number ''R''<sub>''n''</sub> = ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''10'')</sup> consists of ''n'' copies of the digit 1 in base 10 representation. The sequence of repunits base-10 starts with\n: [[1 (number)|1]], [[11 (number)|11]], [[111 (number)|111]], 1111, 11111, 111111, ... {{OEIS|A002275}}.\n\nSimilarly, the repunits base-2 are defined as\n:<math>R_n^{(2)}={2^n-1\\over{2-1}}={2^n-1}\\qquad\\mbox{for }n\\ge1.</math>\nThus, the number ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''2'')</sup> consists of ''n'' copies of the digit 1 in base-2 representation. In fact, the base-2 repunits are the well-known [[Mersenne prime|Mersenne number]]s ''M''<sub>''n''</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1, they start with\n:1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, 127, 255, 511, 1023, 2047, 4095, 8191, 16383, 32767, 65535, ... {{OEIS|id=A000225}}.\n\n== Properties ==\n* Any repunit in any base having a composite number of digits is necessarily composite.  Only repunits (in any base) having a prime number of digits might be prime. This is a necessary but not sufficient condition.  For example,\n*: ''R''<sub>35</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> = {{loop|35|1}} = 11111 \u00d7 1000010000100001000010000100001 = 1111111 \u00d7 10000001000000100000010000001,\n:since 35 = 7 \u00d7 5 = 5 \u00d7 7.  This repunit factorization does not depend on the base-''b'' in which the repunit is expressed.\n* If ''p'' is an odd prime, then every prime ''q'' that divides ''R''<sub>''p''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> must be either 1 plus a multiple of 2''p,'' or a factor of ''b'' \u2212 1. For example, a prime factor of ''R''<sub>29</sub> is 62003 = 1 + 2\u00b729\u00b71069. The reason is that the prime ''p'' is the smallest exponent greater than 1 such that ''q'' divides ''b<sup>p</sup>'' \u2212 1, because ''p'' is prime. Therefore, unless ''q'' divides ''b'' \u2212 1, [[Carmichael function#Order of elements modulo n|''p'' divides the Carmichael function]] of ''q'', which is even and equal to ''q'' \u2212 1. \n*Any positive multiple of the repunit ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> contains at least ''n'' nonzero digits in base-''b''.\n* Any number ''x'' is a two-digit repunit in base x \u2212 1.\n* The only known numbers that are repunits with at least 3 digits in more than one base simultaneously are 31 (111 in base-5, 11111 in base-2) and 8191 (111 in base-90, 1111111111111 in base-2). The [[Goormaghtigh conjecture]] says there are only these two cases.\n* Using the [[pigeon-hole principle]] it can be easily shown that for each ''n'' and ''b'' such that ''n''  and ''b'' are [[Coprime integers|relatively prime]] there exists a repunit in base-''b'' that is a multiple of ''n''. To see this consider repunits ''R''<sub>1</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>,...,''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>. Because there are ''n'' repunits but only ''n''\u22121 non-zero residues modulo ''n'' there exist two repunits ''R''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> and ''R''<sub>''j''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> with 1\u2264''i''<''j''\u2264''n'' such that ''R''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> and ''R''<sub>''j''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> have the same residue modulo ''n''. It follows that ''R''<sub>''j''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> \u2212 ''R''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> has residue 0 modulo ''n'', i.e. is divisible by ''n''. ''R''<sub>''j''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> \u2212 ''R''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> consists of ''j'' \u2212 ''i'' ones followed by ''i'' zeroes. Thus, ''R''<sub>''j''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> \u2212 ''R''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> = ''R''<sub>''j''\u2212''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>  x ''b''<sup>''i''</sup> . Since ''n'' divides the left-hand side it also divides the right-hand side and since ''n'' and ''b'' are relatively prime ''n'' must divide ''R''<sub>''j''\u2212''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>.\n* The [[Feit\u2013Thompson conjecture]] is that ''R''<sub>''q''</sub><sup>(''p'')</sup> never divides ''R''<sub>''p''</sub><sup>(''q'')</sup> for two distinct primes ''p'' and ''q''.\n* Using the [[Euclidean Algorithm]] for repunits definition: ''R''<sub>1</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> = 1; ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> = ''R''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> x ''b'' + 1, any consecutive repunits ''R''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> and ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> are relatively prime in any base-''b'' for any ''n''.\n* If ''m'' and ''n'' have a common divisor ''d'', ''R''<sub>''m''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> and ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> have the common divisor ''R''<sub>''d''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> in any base-''b'' for any ''m'' and ''n''. That is, the repunits of a fixed base form a [[Divisibility sequence|strong divisibility sequence]]. As a consequence, If ''m'' and ''n'' are relatively prime, ''R''<sub>''m''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> and ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> are relatively prime.

If ''n'' is a [[prime power]] (can be written as ''p''<sup>''r''</sup>, with ''p'' prime, ''r'' integer, ''p'', ''r'' >0), then all repunit in base-''b'' are not prime aside from ''R<sub>p</sub>'' and ''R<sub>2</sub>''. ''R<sub>p</sub>'' can be either prime or composite, the former examples, ''b'' = \u2212216, \u2212128, 4, 8, 16, 27, 36, 100, 128, 256, etc., the latter examples, ''b'' = \u2212243, \u2212125, \u221264, \u221232, \u221227, \u22128, 9, 25, 32, 49, 81, 121, 125, 144, 169, 196, 216, 225, 243, 289, etc., and ''R<sub>2</sub>'' can be prime (when ''p'' differs from 2) only if ''b'' is negative, a power of \u22122, for example, ''b'' = \u22128, \u221232, \u2212128, \u22128192, etc., in fact, the ''R<sub>2</sub>'' can also be composite, for example, ''b'' = \u2212512, \u22122048, \u221232768, etc. If ''n'' is not a prime power, then no base-''b'' repunit prime exists, for example, ''b'' = 64, 729 (with ''n'' = 6), ''b'' = 1024 (with ''n'' = 10), and ''b'' = \u22121 or 0 (with ''n'' any natural number). Another special situation is ''b'' = \u22124''k''<sup>4</sup>, with ''k'' positive integer, which has the [[aurifeuillean factorization]], for example, ''b'' = \u22124 (with ''k'' = 1, then ''R<sub>2</sub>'' and ''R<sub>3</sub>'' are primes), and ''b'' = \u221264, \u2212324, \u22121024, \u22122500, \u22125184, ... (with ''k'' = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...), then no base-''b'' repunit prime exists.

Tables of the period of reciprocal of primes up to 60,000 had been published by 1860 and permitted the [[integer factorization|factorization]] by such mathematicians as Reuschle of all repunits up to ''R<sub>16</sub>'' and many larger ones. By 1880, even ''R<sub>17</sub>'' to ''R<sub>36</sub>'' had been factored<ref name=\"Dickson1999\" /> and it is curious that, though [[\u00c9douard Lucas]] showed no prime below three million had period [[19 (number)|nineteen]], there was no attempt to test any repunit for primality until early in the twentieth century. The American mathematician Oscar Hoppe proved ''R<sub>19</sub>'' to be prime in 1916<ref>{{Harvnb|Francis|1988|pp=240\u2013246}}</ref> and Lehmer and Kraitchik independently found ''R<sub>23</sub>'' to be prime in 1929.\n\nFurther advances in the study of repunits did not occur until the 1960s, when computers allowed many new factors of repunits to be found and the gaps in earlier tables of prime periods corrected. ''R<sub>317</sub>'' was found to be a [[probable prime]] circa 1966 and was proved prime eleven years later, when ''R<sub>1031</sub>'' was shown to be the only further possible prime repunit with fewer than ten thousand digits. It was proven prime in 1986, but searches for further prime repunits in the following decade consistently failed. However, there was a major side-development in the field of generalized repunits, which produced a large number of new primes and probable primes.\n\nSince 1999, four further probably prime repunits have been found, but it is unlikely that any of them will be proven prime in the foreseeable future because of their huge size.\n\nThe [[Cunningham project]] endeavours to document the integer factorizations of (among other numbers) the repunits to base 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, and 12.\n\n== Demlo numbers ==\n[[D. R. Kaprekar]] has defined Demlo numbers as concatenation of a left, middle and right part, where the left and right part must be of the same length (up to a possible leading zero to the left) and must add up to a repdigit number, and the middle part may contain any additional number of this repeated digit.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kaprekar|1938}}, {{Harvnb|Gunjikar and Kaprekar|1939}}</ref> \nThey are named after [[Demlo]] railway station 30 miles from Bombay on the then [[G.I.P.

The fact that these are the squares of the repunits has led some authors to call Demlo numbers the infinite sequence of these<ref>{{MathWorld |title= Demlo Number |urlname=DemloNumber}}</ref>, 1, 121, 12321, ..., 12345678987654321, 1234567900987654321, 123456790120987654321, ..., {{OEIS|id=A002477}}, although one can check these are not Demlo numbers for ''p'' = 10, 19, 28, ...\n==See also==\n* [[All one polynomial]] - Another generalization\n* [[Goormaghtigh conjecture]]\n* [[Repeating decimal]]\n* [[Repdigit]]\n* [[Wagstaff prime]] - can be thought of as repunit primes with [[negative base]] <math>b = -2</math>\n\n== Footnotes ==\n=== Notes ===\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n=== References ===\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation\n|last=Beiler\n|first=Albert H.\n|author-link=Albert Beiler\n|orig-year=1964\n|date=2013\n|title=Recreations in the Theory of Numbers: The Queen of Mathematics Entertains\n|publisher=Dover Publications\n|location=New York\n|edition=2nd Revised\n|series=Dover Recreational Math\n|url={{Google books|NbbbL9gMJ88C|Recreations in the theory of numbers|plainurl=yes}}\n|isbn=978-0-486-21096-4\n}}\n*{{Citation\n|last=Dickson\n|first=Leonard Eugene\n|author-link=Leonard Eugene Dickson\n|last2=Cresse\n|first2=G.H.\n|author2-link=G.

The lens adjusted to focus the plane of the slide at the distance of the projection screen, which could be simply a white wall, and it therefore formed an enlarged image of the slide on the screen.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Pfragner, Julius. \"An Optician Looks for Work\".

[[Stereopticon]]s added more powerful light sources to optimize the projection of photographic slides.\n\n===Slides===\nOriginally the pictures were hand painted on glass slides. Initially, figures were rendered with black paint but soon transparent colors were also used. Sometimes the painting was done on oiled paper. Usually black paint was used as a background to block superfluous light, so the figures could be projected without distracting borders or frames. Many slides were finished with a layer of transparent lacquer, but in a later period cover glasses were also used to protect the painted layer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luikerwaal.com/platen1_uk.htm|title=All about lantern slides (1)|publisher=}}</ref> Most handmade slides were mounted in wood frames with a round or square opening for the picture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luikerwaal.com/platen2_uk.htm|title=All about magic lantern slides (2)|website=www.luikerwaal.com}}</ref>\n\n[[File:10 Story about a boy falling in a barrel of honey.JPG|thumb|left|A paper rimmed mass-produced slide.]]\nAfter 1820 the manufacturing of hand colored printed slides started, often making use of [[decalcomania]] transfers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luikerwaal.com/platen1_uk.htm#decal|title=All about lantern slides (1)|website=www.luikerwaal.com}}</ref> Many manufactured slides were produced on strips of glass with several pictures on them and rimmed with a strip of glued paper.\n\nThe first photographic lantern slides, called ''hyalotypes'', were invented by the German-born brothers Ernst Wilhelm (William) and [[Frederick Langenheim|Friedrich (Frederick) Langenheim]] in 1848 in [[Philadelphia]] and patented in 1850.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US7784A/en|title=Improvement in photographic pictures on glass}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/23363210/Glass_Transparencies_Marketing_Photographys_Luminosity_and_Precision_2016_|title=Glass Transparencies: Marketing Photography\u2019s Luminosity and Precision|last=[[Kim Timby|Timby]]|first=[[Kim Timby|Kim]]|year=2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://historiccamera.com/cgi-bin/librarium2/pm.cgi?action=app_display&app=datasheet&app_id=1799&|title=William and Frederick Langenheim at Historic Camera|website=historiccamera.com}}</ref>\n\n===Light sources===\nApart from sunlight, the only light sources available at the time of invention in the 17th century were candles and oil lamps, which were very inefficient and produced very dim projected images. The invention of the [[Argand lamp]] in the 1790s helped to make the images brighter. The invention of [[limelight]] in the 1820s made them very much brighter. The invention of the intensely bright electric [[arc lamp]] in the 1860s eliminated the need for combustible gases or hazardous chemicals, and eventually the incandescent electric lamp further improved safety and convenience, although not brightness.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Waddington, Damer. \"Introduction\".

[[Giovanni Fontana (engineer)|Giovanni Fontana]], [[Leonardo Da Vinci]] and [[Cornelis Drebbel]] described or drew image projectors that had similarities to the magic lantern.\n\nIn the 17th century, there was an immense interest in optics. The [[telescope]] and [[microscope]] were invented (in 1608 and the 1620s respectively) and apart from being useful to some scientists, such instruments were especially popular as entertaining curiosities with people who could afford them.<ref name=rossell2002>{{cite web|first=Deac|last=Rossell|year=2002|title=The Magic Lantern|url=https://www.academia.edu/345943/The_Magic_Lantern}}</ref> The magic lantern would prove a perfect successor.\n\n===Camera obscura===\nThe magic lantern can be seen as a further development of [[camera obscura]]. This is a natural phenomenon that occurs when an image of a scene at the other side of a screen (or for instance a wall) is projected through a small hole in that screen as an inverted image (left to right and upside down) on a surface opposite to the opening. It was known at least since the 5th century BCE and experimented with in darkened rooms at least since circa 1000&nbsp;CE. The use of a lens in the hole has been traced back to circa 1550. The portable camera obscura box with a lens was developed in the 17th century. Dutch inventor [[Cornelis Drebbel]] is thought to have sold one to Dutch poet, composer and diplomat [[Constantijn Huygens]] in 1622,<ref name=Snyder>{{cite web|title=Eye of the Beholder|last=Snyder|first=Laura J.|year=2015|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=EQJ-BAAAQBAJ&lpg=PT110&ots=fqygKmz1u-&dq=friedrich%20risner%20camera%20obscura&pg=PT110#v=onepage&q=friedrich%20risner%20camera%20obscura&f=false}}</ref> while the oldest known clear description of a box-type camera is in German Jesuit scientist [[Gaspar Schott]]'s 1657 book ''Magia universalis natur\u00e6 et artis''.\n\n===Steganographic mirror===\n[[File:1645 kircher - steganographia.jpg|thumb|Illustration of Kircher's Steganographic mirror in his 1645 book ''Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae'']]\nThe 1645 first edition of German Jesuit scholar [[Athanasius Kircher]]'s book ''Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae'' included a description of his invention, the \"Steganographic Mirror\": a primitive projection system with a focusing lens and text or pictures painted on a concave mirror reflecting sunlight, mostly intended for long-distance communication.

Christiaan's father Constantijn had been acquainted with Cornelis Drebbel who used some unidentified optical techniques to transform himself and summon wonderful appearances in magical performances. Constantijn Huygens wrote very enthusiastically about a camera obscura device that he got from Drebbel in 1622.\n\nThe oldest known document concerning the magic lantern is a page on which Christiaan Huygens made ten small sketches of a skeleton taking off its skull, above which he wrote \"for representations by means of convex glasses with the lamp\" (translated from French).

In a 1662 letter to his brother [[Lodewijck Huygens|Lodewijk]] he claimed he thought of it as some old \"bagatelle\" and seemed convinced that it would harm the family's reputation if people found out the lantern came from him.

A separate early magic lantern tradition seems to have been developed in southern Germany and includes lanterns with horizontal cylindrical bodies, while Walgensten's lantern and probably Huygens' both had vertical bodies. This tradition dates at least to 1671, with the arrival of instrument maker Johann Franz Griendel in the city of [[Nuremberg|N\u00fcrnberg]], which Johann Zahn identified as one of the centers of magic lantern production in 1686. Griendel was indicated as the inventor of the magic lantern by Johann Christoph Kohlhans in a 1677 publication.<ref name=Rossell2009 /> It has been suggested that this tradition is older and that instrument maker Johann Wiesel (1583\u20131662) from [[Augsburg]] may have been making magic lanterns earlier on and possibly inspired Griendel and even Huygens. Huygens is known to have studied samples of Wiesel's lens-making and instruments since 1653. Wiesel did make a ship's lantern around 1640 that has much in common with the magic lantern design that Griendel would later apply: a horizontal cylindrical body with a rosette chimney on top, a concave mirror behind a fixture for a candle or lamp inside and a biconvex lens at the front. There is no evidence that Wiesel actually ever made a magic lantern, but in 1674, his successor offered a variety of magic lanterns from the same workshop. This successor is thought to have only continued producing Wiesel's designs after his death in 1662, without adding anything new.<ref>{{cite publication|url=https://www.academia.edu/20378426/The_Origins_of_the_Magic_Lantern_in_Germany_an_example_of_the_use_and_mis-use_of_technology_in_media_history|title=The Origins of the Magic Lantern in Germany|last=Rossell|first=Deac|year=2004}}</ref>\n\n==Further history==\n===Early adopters===\nBefore 1671, only a small circle of people seemed to have knowledge of the magic lantern, and almost every known report of the device from this period had to do with people that were more or less directly connected to Christiaan Huygens. Despite the rejection expressed in his letters to his brother, Huygens must have familiarized several people with the lantern.\n\nIn 1664 Parisian engineer [[Pierre Petit (engineer)|Pierre Petit]] wrote to Huygens to ask for some specifications of the lantern, because he was trying to construct one after seeing the lantern of \"the dane\" (probably Walgensten). The lantern that Petit was constructing had a concave mirror behind the lamp.<ref name=Petit/> This directed more light through the lens, resulting in a brighter projection, and it would become a standard part of most of the lanterns that were made later. Petit may have copied it from Walgensten, but he expressed that he made a lamp stronger than any he had ever seen.\n\nStarting in 1661, Huygens corresponded with London optical instrument-maker [[Richard Reeve]].<ref name=rossell2002/> Reeve was soon selling magic lanterns, demonstrated one in his shop on 17 May 1663 to [[Balthasar de Monconys]]<ref name=\"picturegoing\">{{cite web|url=http://picturegoing.com/?p=4885|website=picturegoing.com|title=Journal des voyages de Monsieur de Monconys &raquo; Picturegoing|accessdate=28 August 2017}}</ref> and sold one to [[Samuel Pepys]] in August 1666.<ref name=\"pepysdiary\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/08/19/|website=pepysdiary.com|title=Sunday 19 August 1666 (The Diary of Samuel Pepys)|accessdate=28 August 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"pepysdiary2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/08/22/|website=pepysdiary.com|title=Wednesday 22 August 1666 (The Diary of Samuel Pepys)|accessdate=28 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Optic Projection fig 404.jpg|thumbnail|left|Illustration from Kircher's 1671 ''Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae'' - projection of hellfire or purgatory]]\n[[File:1671 kircheri - ars magna lucis et umbrae - 769.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration from Kircher's 1671 ''Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae'' - projection of Death]]\nOne of Christiaan Huygens' contacts imagined how [[Athanasius Kircher]] would use the magic lantern: \"If he would know about the invention of the Lantern he would surely frighten the cardinals with specters.\"<ref>{{cite publication|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/huyg003oeuv03_01/huyg003oeuv03_01_0031.php#191T|title=letter from Pierre Guisony to Christiaan Huygens |date=25 March 1660 |language=French}}</ref> Kircher would eventually learn about the existence of the magic lantern via Thomas Walgensten and introduced it as \"Lucerna Magica\" in the widespread 1671 second edition of his book ''Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae''.<ref name=\"ars magna\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gki6ZIbrgQ8C|title=Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae|first=Athanasius|last=Kircher|year=1671|language=latin |accessdate=19 August 2010 |pages=767\u2013769}}</ref> Kircher claimed that Thomas Walgensten reworked his ideas from the previous edition of this book into a better lantern.

The same year many other slides appeared in the company's catalogue: \"The Kings and Queens of England\" (9 sliders taken from David Hume's History of England), \"Astronomical Diagrams and Constellations\" (9 sliders taken from Friedrich Wilhelm Herschel's textbooks), \"Views and Buildings\", Ancient and Modern Costume (62 sliders from various sources).<ref>Philip Carpenter, 1823, A Companion to the Magic Lantern: Part II.</ref> Fifteen sliders of the category \"Humorous\" provided some entertainment, but the focus on education was obvious and very successful.\n\nMass production of slides also made the magic lantern affordable to the masses, opening a market for smaller lanterns with smaller glass sliders, which instead of wooden frames usually had colorful strips of paper glued around their edges.\n\n===Waning popularity===\nThe popularity of magic lanterns waned after the introduction of [[film|movies]] in the 1890s, but they remained a common medium until [[slide projector]]s became widespread during the 1950s.\n\n==Moving images==\n[[File:1870 Plaque de lanterne magique a double systeme--c5620.jpg|thumb|Mice jump into the mouth of a sleeping bearded man on a popular mechanical slide from circa 1870.]]\nThe magic lantern was not only a direct ancestor of the motion picture projector as a means for visual storytelling, but it could itself be used to project moving images.\n\nSome suggestion of movement could be achieved by alternating between pictures of different phases of a motion, but most magic lantern \"animations\" used two glass slides projected together - one with the stationary part of the picture and the other with the part that could be set in motion by hand or by a simple mechanism.\n\nMotion in animated slides was mostly limited to either two phases of a movement or transformation, or a more gradual singular movement (e.g. a train passing through a landscape). These limitations made subjects with repetitive movements popular, like the sails on a windmill turning around or children on a seesaw. Movements could be repeated over and over and could be performed at different speeds.\n\nA common technique that is comparable to the effect of a panning camera makes use of a long slide that is simply pulled slowly through the lantern and usually shows a landscape, sometimes with several phases of a story within the continuous backdrop.\n\nMovement of projected images was also possible by moving the magic lantern itself. This became a staple technique in [[phantasmagoria]] shows in the late 18th century, often with the lantern sliding on rails or riding on small wheels and hidden from the view of the audience behind the projection screen.\n\n===History===\nIn 1645, Kircher had already suggested projecting live insects and shadow puppets from the surface of the mirror in his Steganographic system to perform dramatic scenes.<ref name=Gorman2007>{{cite book|url=https://www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/Preprints/P333.PDF|page=44|title=Inside the Camera Obscura|first=Michael John|last=Gorman|year=2007}}</ref>\n\nChristiaan Huygens' 1659 sketches (see above) suggest he intended to [[animation|animate]] the skeleton to have it take off its head and place it back on its neck.

A paper slip mask would be quickly pulled away to reveal the red fiery discharge and the bullet from a shooting gun.

A common example showed a creature that could move the pupils in its eyes, as if looking in all directions. A long piece of glass could show a procession of figures, or a train with several wagons. Quite convincing illusions of moving waves on a seas or lake have also been achieved with this method.<ref name=luikerbew1>{{cite web|title=Luikerwaal - Mechanical Slides |url=http://www.luikerwaal.com/newframe_uk.htm?/bewegend1_uk.htm|website=www.luikerwaal.com}}</ref>\n*'''slipping slides with masking''': black paint on portions of the moving plate would mask parts of the underlying image - with a black background - on the stationary glass. This made it possible to hide and then reveal the previous position of a part, for instance a limb, to suggest repetitious movement. The suggested movement would be rather jerky and usually operated quickly. Masking in slides was also often used to create change rather than movement (see: Fig. 6 on the illustration by Petrus van Musschenbroek: a man, his wig and his hat): for instance a person's head could be replaced with that of an animal. More gradual and natural movement was also possible; for instance to make a nose grow very long by slowly moving a masking glass.\n*'''lever slides''': the moving part was operated by a lever. These could show a more natural movement than slipping slides and were mostly used for repetitive movements, for instance a woodcutter raising and lowering his axe, or a girl on a swing.<ref name=luikerbew1/> (see: Fig. 5 on the illustration by Petrus van Musschenbroek: a drinking man raising and lowering his glass + Fig. 8: a lady curtsying)\n*'''pulley slides''': a pulley rotates the moving part and could for instance be used to turn the sails on a windmill<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luikerwaal.com/wipwaps01_uk.htm|title=Magic lantern - collection of moving magic lantern slides part 1.|website=www.luikerwaal.com}}</ref> (see: fig. 4 on illustration by Van Musschenbroek)\n*'''rack and pinion slides''': turning the handle of a rackwork would rotate or lift the moving part and could for instance be used to turn the sails on a windmill or for having a hot air balloon take off and descend.

Typical dissolving views showed landscapes dissolving from day to night or from summer to winter. This was achieved by aligning the projection of two matching images and slowly diminishing the first image while introducing the second image.<ref name=luikerbew1/> The subject and the effect of magic lantern dissolving views is similar to the popular [[Diorama]] theatre paintings that originated in Paris in 1822. 19th century magic lantern broadsides often used the terms ''dissolving view'', ''dioramic view'', or simply ''diorama'' interchangeably.<ref name=HuhtamoReview/>\n\nThe effect was reportedly invented by phantasmagoria pioneer [[Paul de Philipsthal]] while in Ireland in 1803 or 1804. He thought of using two lanterns to make the spirit of Samuel appear out of a mist in his representation of the [[Witch of Endor]]. While working out the desired effect, he got the idea of using the technique with landscapes. An 1812 newspaper about a London performance indicates that De Philipsthal presented what was possibly a relatively early incarnation of a dissolving views show, describing it as a \"a series of landscapes (in imitation of moonlight), which insensibly change to various scenes producing a very magical effect.\u201d<ref name=Mirror1842>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=LUMFAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA98#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, And Instruction|page=98|year=1842}}</ref><ref name=Heard2006/>\n\nAnother possible inventor is [[Henry Langdon Childe]], who purportedly once worked for De Philipsthal.<ref name=Heard2006/> He is said to have invented the dissolving views in 1807, and to have improved and completed the technique in 1818.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=MvBeAAAAcAAJ&dq=%22henry%20langdon%20childe%22&pg=PA372#v=onepage&q=%22henry%20langdon%20childe%22&f=false|title=The Art-journal, New Series, Volume XIII|year=1874}}</ref> The oldest known use of the term \"dissolving views\" occurs on playbills for Childe's shows at the [[Adelphi Theatre]] in London in 1837.<ref name=HuhtamoReview/> Childe further popularized the dissolving views at the Royal Polytechnic Institution in the early 1840s.<ref name=Mirror1842/>\n\nDespite later reports about the early invention, and apart from De Philipsthal's 1812 performance, no reports of dissolving view shows before the 1820s are known. Some cases may involve confusion with the Diorama or similar media. In 1826, Scottish magician and ventriloquist M. Henry's introduced what he described as \"beautiful dissolvent scenes,\" \"imperceptibly changing views,\" \"dissolvent views,\" and \"Magic Views\"\u2014created \"by Machinery invented by M. Henry.\" In 1827, Henry Langdon Childe presented \"Scenic Views, showing the various effects of light and shade,\" with a series of subjects that became classics for the dissolving views. In December 1827, De Philipsthal returned with a show that included \"various splendid views (...) transforming themselves imperceptibly (as if it were by Magic) from one form into another.\"<ref name=HuhtamoReview/><ref name=Heard2006/>\n\nBiunial lanterns, with two projecting optical sets in one apparatus, were produced to more easily project dissolving views. Possibly the first horizontal biunial lantern, dubbed the \"Biscenascope\" was made by the optician Mr. Clarke and presented at the Royal Adelaide Gallery in London on December 5, 1840.<ref name=Mirror1842/> The earliest known illustration of a vertical biunial lantern, probably provided by E.G. Wood, appeared in Horne & Thornthwaite catalogue in 1857.<ref name=\"The Magic Lantern Society p. 21-22\"/> Later on triple lanterns enabled additional effects, for instance the effect of snow falling while a green landscape dissolves into a snowy winter version.\n\nA mechanical device could be fitted on the magic lantern, which locked up a diaphragm on the first slide slowly whilst a diaphragm on a second slide opened simultaneously.<ref name=Heard2006/>\n\nPhilip Carpenter's copper-plate printing process, introduced in 1823, may have made it much easier to create duplicate slides with printed outlines that could then be colored differently to create dissolving view slides.<ref name=Heard2006/> However, all early dissolving view slides seem to have been hand-painted.<ref name=HuhtamoReview>{{cite journal|title=Ghost Notes: Reading Mervyn Heard\u2019s Phantasmagoria.

The Dutch probably introduced the magic lantern in Japan before the 1760s. A new style for magic lantern shows was introduced by Kameya Toraku I, who first performed in 1803 in [[Edo]]. Possibly the phantasmagoria shows (popular in the west at that moment) inspired the rear projection technique, moving images and ghost stories.

It was mostly developed in the 17th century and commonly used for entertainment purposes. It was increasingly used for education during the 19th century. Since the late 19th century, smaller versions were also mass-produced as a toy. The magic lantern was in wide use from the 18th century until the mid-20th century, when it was superseded by a compact version that could hold many 35&nbsp;mm photographic slides: the [[slide projector]].\n\n==Technology==\n\n===Apparatus===\n[[File:1721?

The lens adjusted to focus the plane of the slide at the distance of the projection screen, which could be simply a white wall, and it therefore formed an enlarged image of the slide on the screen.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Pfragner, Julius. \"An Optician Looks for Work\".

[[Stereopticon]]s added more powerful light sources to optimize the projection of photographic slides.\n\n===Slides===\nOriginally the pictures were hand painted on glass slides. Initially, figures were rendered with black paint but soon transparent colors were also used. Sometimes the painting was done on oiled paper. Usually black paint was used as a background to block superfluous light, so the figures could be projected without distracting borders or frames. Many slides were finished with a layer of transparent lacquer, but in a later period cover glasses were also used to protect the painted layer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luikerwaal.com/platen1_uk.htm|title=All about lantern slides (1)|publisher=}}</ref> Most handmade slides were mounted in wood frames with a round or square opening for the picture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luikerwaal.com/platen2_uk.htm|title=All about magic lantern slides (2)|website=www.luikerwaal.com}}</ref>\n\n[[File:10 Story about a boy falling in a barrel of honey.JPG|thumb|left|A paper rimmed mass-produced slide.]]\nAfter 1820 the manufacturing of hand colored printed slides started, often making use of [[decalcomania]] transfers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luikerwaal.com/platen1_uk.htm#decal|title=All about lantern slides (1)|website=www.luikerwaal.com}}</ref> Many manufactured slides were produced on strips of glass with several pictures on them and rimmed with a strip of glued paper.\n\nThe first photographic lantern slides, called ''hyalotypes'', were invented by the German-born brothers Ernst Wilhelm (William) and [[Frederick Langenheim|Friedrich (Frederick) Langenheim]] in 1848 in [[Philadelphia]] and patented in 1850.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US7784A/en|title=Improvement in photographic pictures on glass}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/23363210/Glass_Transparencies_Marketing_Photographys_Luminosity_and_Precision_2016_|title=Glass Transparencies: Marketing Photography\u2019s Luminosity and Precision|last=[[Kim Timby|Timby]]|first=[[Kim Timby|Kim]]|year=2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://historiccamera.com/cgi-bin/librarium2/pm.cgi?action=app_display&app=datasheet&app_id=1799&|title=William and Frederick Langenheim at Historic Camera|website=historiccamera.com}}</ref>\n\n===Light sources===\nApart from sunlight, the only light sources available at the time of invention in the 17th century were candles and oil lamps, which were very inefficient and produced very dim projected images. The invention of the [[Argand lamp]] in the 1790s helped to make the images brighter. The invention of [[limelight]] in the 1820s made them very much brighter. The invention of the intensely bright electric [[arc lamp]] in the 1860s eliminated the need for combustible gases or hazardous chemicals, and eventually the incandescent electric lamp further improved safety and convenience, although not brightness.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Waddington, Damer. \"Introduction\".

[[Giovanni Fontana (engineer)|Giovanni Fontana]], [[Leonardo Da Vinci]] and [[Cornelis Drebbel]] described or drew image projectors that had similarities to the magic lantern.\n\nIn the 17th century, there was an immense interest in optics. The [[telescope]] and [[microscope]] were invented (in 1608 and the 1620s respectively) and apart from being useful to some scientists, such instruments were especially popular as entertaining curiosities with people who could afford them.<ref name=rossell2002>{{cite web|first=Deac|last=Rossell|year=2002|title=The Magic Lantern|url=https://www.academia.edu/345943/The_Magic_Lantern}}</ref> The magic lantern would prove a perfect successor.\n\n===Camera obscura===\nThe magic lantern can be seen as a further development of [[camera obscura]]. This is a natural phenomenon that occurs when an image of a scene at the other side of a screen (or for instance a wall) is projected through a small hole in that screen as an inverted image (left to right and upside down) on a surface opposite to the opening. It was known at least since the 5th century BCE and experimented with in darkened rooms at least since circa 1000&nbsp;CE. The use of a lens in the hole has been traced back to circa 1550. The portable camera obscura box with a lens was developed in the 17th century. Dutch inventor [[Cornelis Drebbel]] is thought to have sold one to Dutch poet, composer and diplomat [[Constantijn Huygens]] in 1622,<ref name=Snyder>{{cite web|title=Eye of the Beholder|last=Snyder|first=Laura J.|year=2015|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=EQJ-BAAAQBAJ&lpg=PT110&ots=fqygKmz1u-&dq=friedrich%20risner%20camera%20obscura&pg=PT110#v=onepage&q=friedrich%20risner%20camera%20obscura&f=false}}</ref> while the oldest known clear description of a box-type camera is in German Jesuit scientist [[Gaspar Schott]]'s 1657 book ''Magia universalis natur\u00e6 et artis''.\n\n===Steganographic mirror===\n[[File:1645 kircher - steganographia.jpg|thumb|Illustration of Kircher's Steganographic mirror in his 1645 book ''Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae'']]\nThe 1645 first edition of German Jesuit scholar [[Athanasius Kircher]]'s book ''Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae'' included a description of his invention, the \"Steganographic Mirror\": a primitive projection system with a focusing lens and text or pictures painted on a concave mirror reflecting sunlight, mostly intended for long-distance communication. He saw limitations in the increase of size and diminished clarity over a long distance and expressed his hope that someone would find a method to improve on this.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=hUvNnJteew4C&pg=RA1-PR5#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae|last=Kircher|first=Athanasius|page=912|year=1645}}</ref>\n\nIn 1654, Belgian Jesuit mathematician [[Andr\u00e9 Tacquet]] used Kircher's technique to show the journey from China to Belgium of Italian Jesuit missionary [[Martino Martini]].<ref>{{cite web|language=Dutch, Latin|title=De zeventiende eeuw.

Christiaan's father Constantijn had been acquainted with Cornelis Drebbel who used some unidentified optical techniques to transform himself and summon wonderful appearances in magical performances. Constantijn Huygens wrote very enthusiastically about a camera obscura device that he got from Drebbel in 1622.\n\nThe oldest known document concerning the magic lantern is a page on which Christiaan Huygens made ten small sketches of a skeleton taking off its skull, above which he wrote \"for representations by means of convex glasses with the lamp\" (translated from French). As this page was found between documents dated in 1659, it is believed to also have been made in 1659.<ref>{{cite web|first=Christiaan|last=Huygens|title=Pour des representations par le moyen de verres convexes \u00e0 la lampe|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/huyg003oeuv22_01/huyg003oeuv22_01_0093.php|language=French}}</ref> Huygens soon seemed to regret this invention, as he thought it was too frivolous. In a 1662 letter to his brother [[Lodewijck Huygens|Lodewijk]] he claimed he thought of it as some old \"bagatelle\" and seemed convinced that it would harm the family's reputation if people found out the lantern came from him. Christiaan had reluctantly sent a lantern to their father, but when he realized that Constantijn intended to show the lantern to the court of King [[Louis XIV of France]] at the Louvre, Christiaan asked Lodewijk to sabotage the lantern.<ref>{{cite web |first=Christiaan |last=Huygens |date=19 April 1662 |title=letter to Lodewijk Huygens |language=French |url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/huyg003oeuv04_01/huyg003oeuv04_01_0059.php#z1005}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1694 Christiaan Huygens - Laterna Magica.jpg|thumb|Huygens' 1694 laterna magica sketch, showing: \"speculum cavum (hollow mirror). lucerna (lamp). lens vitrea (glass lens). pictura pellucida (transparent picture). lens altera (other lens). paries (wall).\"]]\nChristiaan initially referred to the magic lantern as \"la lampe\" and \"la lanterne\", but in the last years of his life he used the then common term \"laterna magica\" in some notes.

A separate early magic lantern tradition seems to have been developed in southern Germany and includes lanterns with horizontal cylindrical bodies, while Walgensten's lantern and probably Huygens' both had vertical bodies. This tradition dates at least to 1671, with the arrival of instrument maker Johann Franz Griendel in the city of [[Nuremberg|N\u00fcrnberg]], which Johann Zahn identified as one of the centers of magic lantern production in 1686. Griendel was indicated as the inventor of the magic lantern by Johann Christoph Kohlhans in a 1677 publication.<ref name=Rossell2009 /> It has been suggested that this tradition is older and that instrument maker Johann Wiesel (1583\u20131662) from [[Augsburg]] may have been making magic lanterns earlier on and possibly inspired Griendel and even Huygens. Huygens is known to have studied samples of Wiesel's lens-making and instruments since 1653. Wiesel did make a ship's lantern around 1640 that has much in common with the magic lantern design that Griendel would later apply: a horizontal cylindrical body with a rosette chimney on top, a concave mirror behind a fixture for a candle or lamp inside and a biconvex lens at the front. There is no evidence that Wiesel actually ever made a magic lantern, but in 1674, his successor offered a variety of magic lanterns from the same workshop. This successor is thought to have only continued producing Wiesel's designs after his death in 1662, without adding anything new.<ref>{{cite publication|url=https://www.academia.edu/20378426/The_Origins_of_the_Magic_Lantern_in_Germany_an_example_of_the_use_and_mis-use_of_technology_in_media_history|title=The Origins of the Magic Lantern in Germany|last=Rossell|first=Deac|year=2004}}</ref>\n\n==Further history==\n===Early adopters===\nBefore 1671, only a small circle of people seemed to have knowledge of the magic lantern, and almost every known report of the device from this period had to do with people that were more or less directly connected to Christiaan Huygens. Despite the rejection expressed in his letters to his brother, Huygens must have familiarized several people with the lantern.\n\nIn 1664 Parisian engineer [[Pierre Petit (engineer)|Pierre Petit]] wrote to Huygens to ask for some specifications of the lantern, because he was trying to construct one after seeing the lantern of \"the dane\" (probably Walgensten). The lantern that Petit was constructing had a concave mirror behind the lamp.<ref name=Petit/> This directed more light through the lens, resulting in a brighter projection, and it would become a standard part of most of the lanterns that were made later. Petit may have copied it from Walgensten, but he expressed that he made a lamp stronger than any he had ever seen.\n\nStarting in 1661, Huygens corresponded with London optical instrument-maker [[Richard Reeve]].<ref name=rossell2002/> Reeve was soon selling magic lanterns, demonstrated one in his shop on 17 May 1663 to [[Balthasar de Monconys]]<ref name=\"picturegoing\">{{cite web|url=http://picturegoing.com/?p=4885|website=picturegoing.com|title=Journal des voyages de Monsieur de Monconys &raquo; Picturegoing|accessdate=28 August 2017}}</ref> and sold one to [[Samuel Pepys]] in August 1666.<ref name=\"pepysdiary\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/08/19/|website=pepysdiary.com|title=Sunday 19 August 1666 (The Diary of Samuel Pepys)|accessdate=28 August 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"pepysdiary2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/08/22/|website=pepysdiary.com|title=Wednesday 22 August 1666 (The Diary of Samuel Pepys)|accessdate=28 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Optic Projection fig 404.jpg|thumbnail|left|Illustration from Kircher's 1671 ''Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae'' - projection of hellfire or purgatory]]\n[[File:1671 kircheri - ars magna lucis et umbrae - 769.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration from Kircher's 1671 ''Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae'' - projection of Death]]\nOne of Christiaan Huygens' contacts imagined how [[Athanasius Kircher]] would use the magic lantern: \"If he would know about the invention of the Lantern he would surely frighten the cardinals with specters.\"<ref>{{cite publication|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/huyg003oeuv03_01/huyg003oeuv03_01_0031.php#191T|title=letter from Pierre Guisony to Christiaan Huygens |date=25 March 1660 |language=French}}</ref> Kircher would eventually learn about the existence of the magic lantern via Thomas Walgensten and introduced it as \"Lucerna Magica\" in the widespread 1671 second edition of his book ''Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae''.<ref name=\"ars magna\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gki6ZIbrgQ8C|title=Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae|first=Athanasius|last=Kircher|year=1671|language=latin |accessdate=19 August 2010 |pages=767\u2013769}}</ref> Kircher claimed that Thomas Walgensten reworked his ideas from the previous edition of this book into a better lantern.

The first known set ''The Elements of Zoology'' became available in 1823, with over 200 images in 56 frames of zoological figures, classified according to the system of the Swedish scientist [[Carl Linnaeus]]. The same year many other slides appeared in the company's catalogue: \"The Kings and Queens of England\" (9 sliders taken from David Hume's History of England), \"Astronomical Diagrams and Constellations\" (9 sliders taken from Friedrich Wilhelm Herschel's textbooks), \"Views and Buildings\", Ancient and Modern Costume (62 sliders from various sources).<ref>Philip Carpenter, 1823, A Companion to the Magic Lantern: Part II.</ref> Fifteen sliders of the category \"Humorous\" provided some entertainment, but the focus on education was obvious and very successful.\n\nMass production of slides also made the magic lantern affordable to the masses, opening a market for smaller lanterns with smaller glass sliders, which instead of wooden frames usually had colorful strips of paper glued around their edges.\n\n===Waning popularity===\nThe popularity of magic lanterns waned after the introduction of [[film|movies]] in the 1890s, but they remained a common medium until [[slide projector]]s became widespread during the 1950s.\n\n==Moving images==\n[[File:1870 Plaque de lanterne magique a double systeme--c5620.jpg|thumb|Mice jump into the mouth of a sleeping bearded man on a popular mechanical slide from circa 1870.]]\nThe magic lantern was not only a direct ancestor of the motion picture projector as a means for visual storytelling, but it could itself be used to project moving images.\n\nSome suggestion of movement could be achieved by alternating between pictures of different phases of a motion, but most magic lantern \"animations\" used two glass slides projected together - one with the stationary part of the picture and the other with the part that could be set in motion by hand or by a simple mechanism.\n\nMotion in animated slides was mostly limited to either two phases of a movement or transformation, or a more gradual singular movement (e.g. a train passing through a landscape). These limitations made subjects with repetitive movements popular, like the sails on a windmill turning around or children on a seesaw. Movements could be repeated over and over and could be performed at different speeds.\n\nA common technique that is comparable to the effect of a panning camera makes use of a long slide that is simply pulled slowly through the lantern and usually shows a landscape, sometimes with several phases of a story within the continuous backdrop.\n\nMovement of projected images was also possible by moving the magic lantern itself. This became a staple technique in [[phantasmagoria]] shows in the late 18th century, often with the lantern sliding on rails or riding on small wheels and hidden from the view of the audience behind the projection screen.\n\n===History===\nIn 1645, Kircher had already suggested projecting live insects and shadow puppets from the surface of the mirror in his Steganographic system to perform dramatic scenes.<ref name=Gorman2007>{{cite book|url=https://www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/Preprints/P333.PDF|page=44|title=Inside the Camera Obscura|first=Michael John|last=Gorman|year=2007}}</ref>\n\nChristiaan Huygens' 1659 sketches (see above) suggest he intended to [[animation|animate]] the skeleton to have it take off its head and place it back on its neck. This can be seen as an indication that the very first magic lantern demonstrations may already have included projections of simple animations.<ref name=Rossell2005/>\n\nIn 1668, [[Robert Hooke]] wrote about the effects of a type of magic lantern installation: \"Spectators not well versed in optics, that should see the various apparitions and disappearances, the motions, changes and actions that may this way be represented, would readily believe them to be supernatural and miraculous.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=92lnIw3oKGMC&lpg=PA269&ots=Ym_S2RrJ4U&dq=It+produces+Effects+not+only+very+delightful,+but+to+such+as+know+the+contrivance,+very+wonderful;+so+that+Spectators,+not+well+versed+in+Opticks,&pg=PA269#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, from Their Commencement in 1665 to the Year 1800|author=|date=22 May 2018|publisher=|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nIn 1675, German polymath and philosopher [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] proposed a kind of world exhibition that would show all kinds of new inventions and spectacles.

Wheels were cut from the glass plate with a diamond and rotated by a thread that was spun around small brass wheels attached to the glass wheels. A paper slip mask would be quickly pulled away to reveal the red fiery discharge and the bullet from a shooting gun. [[Zacharias Conrad von Uffenbach]] visited Themme's shop and liked the effects, but was disappointed about the very simple mechanisms. Nonetheless he bought seven moving slides, as well as twelve slides with four pictures each, which he thought were delicately painted.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=ZX5dAAAAcAAJ&lpg=PA42&ots=M30ocyCaf3&dq=Uffenbach%20themme&pg=PA58#v=onepage&q=zauber&f=false|last=Von Uffenbach|title=Merkw\u00fcrdige Reisen durch Niedersachsen, Holland und Engelland - Erster Theil|pages=62\u201363|year=1753|language=German}}</ref>\n\nSeveral types of mechanical slides were described and illustrated in Dutch professor of mathematics, physics, philosophy, medicine, and astronomy [[Pieter van Musschenbroek]]'s second edition (1739) of ''Beginsels Der Natuurkunde''.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=Js1WAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA627#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Beginsels Der Natuurkunde|year=1739|last=Van Musschenbroek|first=Pieter|page=617+633}}</ref> Pieter was the brother of Jan van Musschenbroek, the maker of an outstanding magic lantern with excellent lenses and a diaphragm (see illustration above).<ref name=Rossell2005/>\n\nIn 1770, [[Edm\u00e9-Gilles Guyot]] described a method of using two slides for the depiction of a storm at sea, with waves on one slide and ships and a few clouds on another. Lanternists could project the illusion of mild waves turning into a wild sea tossing the ships around by increasing the movement of the separate slides. Guyot also detailed how projection on smoke could be used to create the illusion of ghosts hovering in the air, which would become a technique commonly used in [[phantasmagoria]].<ref name=Rossell2005>{{cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/341263/The_Magic_Lantern_and_Moving_Images_before_1800|first=Deac|last=Rossell|title=The Magic Lantern and Moving Images before 1800|year=2005}}</ref>\n\nAn especially intricate multiple rackwork mechanism was developed to show the movements of the planets (sometimes accompanied by revolving satellites) revolving around the sun. In 1795, one M. Dicas offered an early magic lantern system, the Lucernal or Portable Eidouranian, that showed the orbiting planets.

A common example showed a creature that could move the pupils in its eyes, as if looking in all directions. A long piece of glass could show a procession of figures, or a train with several wagons. Quite convincing illusions of moving waves on a seas or lake have also been achieved with this method.<ref name=luikerbew1>{{cite web|title=Luikerwaal - Mechanical Slides |url=http://www.luikerwaal.com/newframe_uk.htm?/bewegend1_uk.htm|website=www.luikerwaal.com}}</ref>\n*'''slipping slides with masking''': black paint on portions of the moving plate would mask parts of the underlying image - with a black background - on the stationary glass. This made it possible to hide and then reveal the previous position of a part, for instance a limb, to suggest repetitious movement. The suggested movement would be rather jerky and usually operated quickly. Masking in slides was also often used to create change rather than movement (see: Fig. 6 on the illustration by Petrus van Musschenbroek: a man, his wig and his hat): for instance a person's head could be replaced with that of an animal. More gradual and natural movement was also possible; for instance to make a nose grow very long by slowly moving a masking glass.\n*'''lever slides''': the moving part was operated by a lever. These could show a more natural movement than slipping slides and were mostly used for repetitive movements, for instance a woodcutter raising and lowering his axe, or a girl on a swing.<ref name=luikerbew1/> (see: Fig. 5 on the illustration by Petrus van Musschenbroek: a drinking man raising and lowering his glass + Fig. 8: a lady curtsying)\n*'''pulley slides''': a pulley rotates the moving part and could for instance be used to turn the sails on a windmill<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luikerwaal.com/wipwaps01_uk.htm|title=Magic lantern - collection of moving magic lantern slides part 1.|website=www.luikerwaal.com}}</ref> (see: fig. 4 on illustration by Van Musschenbroek)\n*'''rack and pinion slides''': turning the handle of a rackwork would rotate or lift the moving part and could for instance be used to turn the sails on a windmill or for having a hot air balloon take off and descend. A more complex astronomical rackwork slide showed the planets and their satellites orbiting around the sun.<ref name=luikerbew1/>\n*'''fantoccini slides''': jointed figures set in motion by levers, thin rods, or cams and worm wheels.

Typical dissolving views showed landscapes dissolving from day to night or from summer to winter. This was achieved by aligning the projection of two matching images and slowly diminishing the first image while introducing the second image.<ref name=luikerbew1/> The subject and the effect of magic lantern dissolving views is similar to the popular [[Diorama]] theatre paintings that originated in Paris in 1822. 19th century magic lantern broadsides often used the terms ''dissolving view'', ''dioramic view'', or simply ''diorama'' interchangeably.<ref name=HuhtamoReview/>\n\nThe effect was reportedly invented by phantasmagoria pioneer [[Paul de Philipsthal]] while in Ireland in 1803 or 1804. He thought of using two lanterns to make the spirit of Samuel appear out of a mist in his representation of the [[Witch of Endor]]. While working out the desired effect, he got the idea of using the technique with landscapes. An 1812 newspaper about a London performance indicates that De Philipsthal presented what was possibly a relatively early incarnation of a dissolving views show, describing it as a \"a series of landscapes (in imitation of moonlight), which insensibly change to various scenes producing a very magical effect.\u201d<ref name=Mirror1842>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=LUMFAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA98#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, And Instruction|page=98|year=1842}}</ref><ref name=Heard2006/>\n\nAnother possible inventor is [[Henry Langdon Childe]], who purportedly once worked for De Philipsthal.<ref name=Heard2006/> He is said to have invented the dissolving views in 1807, and to have improved and completed the technique in 1818.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=MvBeAAAAcAAJ&dq=%22henry%20langdon%20childe%22&pg=PA372#v=onepage&q=%22henry%20langdon%20childe%22&f=false|title=The Art-journal, New Series, Volume XIII|year=1874}}</ref> The oldest known use of the term \"dissolving views\" occurs on playbills for Childe's shows at the [[Adelphi Theatre]] in London in 1837.<ref name=HuhtamoReview/> Childe further popularized the dissolving views at the Royal Polytechnic Institution in the early 1840s.<ref name=Mirror1842/>\n\nDespite later reports about the early invention, and apart from De Philipsthal's 1812 performance, no reports of dissolving view shows before the 1820s are known. Some cases may involve confusion with the Diorama or similar media. In 1826, Scottish magician and ventriloquist M. Henry's introduced what he described as \"beautiful dissolvent scenes,\" \"imperceptibly changing views,\" \"dissolvent views,\" and \"Magic Views\"\u2014created \"by Machinery invented by M. Henry.\" In 1827, Henry Langdon Childe presented \"Scenic Views, showing the various effects of light and shade,\" with a series of subjects that became classics for the dissolving views. In December 1827, De Philipsthal returned with a show that included \"various splendid views (...) transforming themselves imperceptibly (as if it were by Magic) from one form into another.\"<ref name=HuhtamoReview/><ref name=Heard2006/>\n\nBiunial lanterns, with two projecting optical sets in one apparatus, were produced to more easily project dissolving views. Possibly the first horizontal biunial lantern, dubbed the \"Biscenascope\" was made by the optician Mr. Clarke and presented at the Royal Adelaide Gallery in London on December 5, 1840.<ref name=Mirror1842/> The earliest known illustration of a vertical biunial lantern, probably provided by E.G. Wood, appeared in Horne & Thornthwaite catalogue in 1857.<ref name=\"The Magic Lantern Society p. 21-22\"/> Later on triple lanterns enabled additional effects, for instance the effect of snow falling while a green landscape dissolves into a snowy winter version.\n\nA mechanical device could be fitted on the magic lantern, which locked up a diaphragm on the first slide slowly whilst a diaphragm on a second slide opened simultaneously.<ref name=Heard2006/>\n\nPhilip Carpenter's copper-plate printing process, introduced in 1823, may have made it much easier to create duplicate slides with printed outlines that could then be colored differently to create dissolving view slides.<ref name=Heard2006/> However, all early dissolving view slides seem to have been hand-painted.<ref name=HuhtamoReview>{{cite journal|title=Ghost Notes: Reading Mervyn Heard\u2019s Phantasmagoria.

Marion's ''L'Optique'' (1867)]]\nPhantasmagoria was a form of horror theater that used one or more magic lanterns to project frightening images, especially of ghosts. Showmen used rear projection, mobile or portable projectors and all kinds of effects to produce convincing [[necromancy|necromantic]] experiences. It was very popular in Europe from the late 18th century to well into the 19th century.\n\nIt is thought that optical devices like concave mirrors and the camera obscura have been used since antiquity to fool spectators into believing they saw real gods and spirits,<ref name=Heard2006>Heard, Mervyn. ''PHANTASMAGORIA: The Secret History of the Magic Lantern''. The Projection Box, 2006</ref> but it was the magician [[Paul Philidor|\"physicist\" Phylidor]] who created what must have been the first true phantasmagoria show. He probably used mobile magic lanterns with the recently invented [[Argand lamp]]<ref name=\"Grau\">[[Oliver Grau|Grau, Oliver]]. ''Remember the Phantasmagoria!'' chapter from ''MediaArtHistories'', MIT Press/Leonardo Books, 2007, p. 144</ref> to create his successful ''Schr\u00f6pferischen, und Cagliostoischen Geister-Erscheinungen'' (Schr\u00f6pfer-esque and Cagiostro-esque Ghost Apparitions)<ref>Phylidor ''Schr\u00f6pferischen, und Cagliostoischen Geister-Erscheinungen'' flyer 1790</ref> in Vienna from 1790 to 1792. Phylidor stated that his show of perfected apparitions revealed how charlatans like [[Johann Georg Schr\u00f6pfer]] and [[Cagliostro]] had fooled their audiences. As \"Paul Filidort\" he presented his ''Phantasmagorie'' in Paris From December 1792 to July 1793,<ref name= Rossell2001>{{cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/4609248/The_19_Century_German_Origins_of_the_Phantasmagoria_Show|title=The 19 Century German Origins of the Phantasmagoria Show|last=Rossell|first=Deac|year=2001}}</ref><ref>''Affiches, annonces et avis divers''. 1793-07-23</ref> probably using the term for the first time. As \"Paul de Philipsthal\" he performed ''Phantasmagoria'' shows in Britain since 1801 with great success.\n\nOne of many showmen who were inspired by Phylidor, [[Etienne-Gaspard Robert]] became very famous with his own ''Fantasmagorie'' show in Paris from 1798 to 1803 (later performing throughout Europe and returning to Paris for a triumphant comeback in Paris in 1814). He patented a mobile \"Fantascope\" lantern in 1798.<ref name=Heard2006/>\n\n==Royal Polytechnic Institution shows==\nWhen it opened in 1838, The Royal Polytechnic Institution in London became a very popular and influential venue with all kinds of magic lantern shows as an important part of its program. At the main theatre, with 500 seats, lanternists would make good use of a battery of six large lanterns running on tracked tables to project the finely detailed images of extra large slides on the 648 square feet screen. The magic lantern was used to illustrate lectures, concerts, pantomimes and other forms of theatre. Popular magic lantern presentations included Henry Langon Childe's dissolving views, his chromatrope, phantasmagoria and mechanical slides.<ref name=Heard2006/><ref>{{cite publication|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=chQiAQAAMAAJ&dq=childe%20polytechnic&pg=PA410#v=onepage&q=childe%20polytechnic&f=false|title=The Magazine of Science, and Schools of Art - Vol. IV|year=1843|page=410}}</ref>\n\n==Utushi-e==\nUtushi-e is a type of magic lantern show that became popular in Japan in the 19th century. The Dutch probably introduced the magic lantern in Japan before the 1760s. A new style for magic lantern shows was introduced by Kameya Toraku I, who first performed in 1803 in [[Edo]]. Possibly the phantasmagoria shows (popular in the west at that moment) inspired the rear projection technique, moving images and ghost stories. Japanese showmen developed lightweight wooden projectors (furo) that were handheld so that several performers could move the projections of different colourful figures move around the screen at the same time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.f.waseda.jp/kusahara/Utsushi-e/What_Is_Utsushi-e.html|title=What is Utsushi-e?|website=www.f.waseda.jp}}</ref> The Western techniques of mechanical slides were combined with traditional Japanese skills\u2014especially from [[Karakuri puppet]]s\u2014to further animate the figures and for special effects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.f.waseda.jp/kusahara/Utsushi-e/Taneita(Slides).html|title=Taneita(Slides)|website=www.f.waseda.jp}}</ref>\n\n==Today==\nSome enthusiasts claim that the brilliant quality of color in lantern slides is unsurpassed by successive projection media. The magic lantern and lantern slides are still popular with collectors and can be found in many museums. However, of the original lanterns from the first 150 years after its invention only 28 are known to still exist (as of 2009).<ref name =Rossell2009>{{citation|periodical=The Magic Lantern Gazette|url=https://library.sdsu.edu/pdf/scua/ML_Gazette/MLGvol21no01.pdf|last=Rossell|first=Deac|title=Early Magic Lantern Illustrations: What Can They Tell Us About Magic Lantern History?|year=2009}}</ref>\nMuseums usually prefer not to use their slides for projections, but often provide video representations of the slides.\n\nA collaborative research project of several European universities called ''A Million Pictures'' started in June 2015 and lasted until May 2018.

These included the concept of [[Aposematism|warning colouration]] in animals, and the [[Wallace effect]], a hypothesis on how natural selection could contribute to [[speciation]] by encouraging the development of barriers against [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridisation]]. Wallace's 1904 book ''Man's Place in the Universe'' was the first serious attempt by a biologist to evaluate the [[Planetary habitability|likelihood of life on other planets]]. He was also one of the first scientists to write a serious exploration of the subject of whether there was life on Mars.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S730.htm|title=Is Mars Habitable?, by Alfred Russel Wallace|website=people.wku.edu|access-date=2017-10-15}}</ref>\n\nWallace was strongly attracted to unconventional ideas (such as evolution). His advocacy of [[spiritualism]] and his belief in a [[Mind\u2013body dualism|non-material origin]] for the higher mental faculties of humans strained his relationship with some members of the scientific establishment.\n\nAside from scientific work, he was a social activist who was critical of what he considered to be an unjust social and economic system (capitalism) in 19th-century Britain. His interest in natural history resulted in his being one of the first prominent scientists to raise concerns over the environmental impact of human activity. He was also a prolific author who wrote on both scientific and social issues; his account of his adventures and observations during his explorations in Singapore, [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]], ''[[The Malay Archipelago]]'', was both popular and highly regarded. Since its publication in 1869, it has never been out of print.\n\nWallace had financial difficulties throughout much of his life. His Amazon and Far Eastern trips were supported by the sale of specimens he collected and, after he lost most of the considerable money he made from those sales in unsuccessful investments, he had to support himself mostly from the publications he produced. Unlike some of his contemporaries in the British scientific community, such as Darwin and [[Charles Lyell]], he had no family wealth to fall back on, and he was unsuccessful in finding a long-term salaried position, receiving no regular income until he was awarded a small government pension, through Darwin's efforts, in 1881.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nAlfred Wallace was born in the Welsh village of [[Llanbadoc]], near [[Usk]], [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]].<ref>Wilson ''The Forgotten Naturalist'' p. 1.</ref> He was the eighth of nine children of Thomas Vere Wallace and Mary Anne Greenell.

This was a stopgap measure until William, his oldest brother, was ready to take him on as an apprentice [[surveying|surveyor]]. While in London, Alfred attended lectures and read books at the [[London Mechanics Institute]] (current [[Birkbeck, University of London]]) . Here he was exposed to the radical political ideas of the Welsh social reformer [[Robert Owen]] and of [[Thomas Paine]]. He left London in 1837 to live with William and work as his apprentice for six years.\n\nAt the end of 1839, they moved to [[Kington, Herefordshire|Kington]], Hereford, near the Welsh border, before eventually settling at [[Neath]] in [[Glamorgan]] in Wales. Between 1840 and 1843, Wallace did land surveying work in the countryside of the west of England and Wales.<ref>Raby ''Bright Paradise'' pp. 77\u201378.</ref><ref>Ross A. Slotten. ''The Heretic in Darwin's Court:The Life of Alfred Russel Wallace''.Columbia University Press, June 2004.pp. 11\u201314.</ref> By the end of 1843, William's business had declined due to difficult economic conditions, and Wallace, at the age of 20, left in January.\n\nOne result of Wallace's early travels is a modern controversy about his nationality. Since Wallace was born in [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]], some sources have considered him to be Welsh.<ref>{{cite web|title=28.

One Wallace scholar has stated that the most reasonable interpretation is therefore that he was an Englishman born in Wales.<ref name=\"Smith\"/>\n\nAfter a brief period of unemployment, he was hired as a master at the Collegiate School in [[Leicester]] to teach drawing, mapmaking, and surveying. Wallace spent many hours at the library in Leicester: he read ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' by [[Thomas Robert Malthus]], and one evening he met the entomologist [[Henry Walter Bates|Henry Bates]]. Bates was 19 years old, and in 1843 he had published a paper on beetles in the journal ''Zoologist''. He befriended Wallace and started him collecting insects.<ref>Shermer ''In Darwin's Shadow'' p. 53.</ref><ref>Slotten pp. 22\u201326.</ref> William died in March 1845, and Wallace left his teaching position to assume control of his brother's firm in Neath, but his brother John and he were unable to make the business work. After a few months, Wallace found work as a civil engineer for a nearby firm that was working on a survey for a proposed railway in the [[River Neath|Vale of Neath]].\n\nWallace's work on the survey involved spending a lot of time outdoors in the countryside, allowing him to indulge his new passion for collecting insects. Wallace persuaded his brother John to join him in starting another architecture and civil engineering firm, which carried out a number of projects, including the design of a building for the Neath [[Mechanics' Institute]], founded in 1843.<ref>[http://www.tlysau.org.uk/cgi-bin/anw/search2?coll_id=11281&inst_id=35&term=Neath \"Neath Mechanics' Institute\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110014026/http://www.tlysau.org.uk/cgi-bin/anw/search2?coll_id=11281&inst_id=35&term=Neath |date=10 November 2013 }} [[Swansea University]].

Their intention was to collect insects and other animal specimens in the [[Amazon Rainforest]] for their private collections, selling the duplicates to museums and collectors back in Britain in order to fund the trip. Wallace also hoped to gather evidence of the [[transmutation of species]].\n\nWallace and Bates spent most of their first year collecting near [[Bel\u00e9m]], then explored inland separately, occasionally meeting to discuss their findings. In 1849, they were briefly joined by another young explorer, botanist [[Richard Spruce]], along with Wallace's younger brother Herbert. Herbert left soon thereafter (dying two years later from [[yellow fever]]), but Spruce, like Bates, would spend over ten years collecting in South America.<ref>Wilson p. 36; Raby pp. 89, 98\u201399, 120\u201321.</ref>\n\nWallace continued charting the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] for four years, collecting specimens and making notes on the peoples and languages he encountered as well as the geography, flora, and fauna.<ref>Raby pp. 89\u201395.</ref> On 12 July 1852, Wallace embarked for the UK on the brig ''Helen''. After 26 days at sea, the ship's cargo caught fire and the crew was forced to abandon ship. All of the specimens Wallace had on the ship, mostly collected during the last, and most interesting, two years of his trip, were lost. He managed to save a few notes and pencil sketches and little else.\n\nWallace and the crew spent ten days in an open boat before being picked up by the brig ''Jordeson'', which was sailing from Cuba to London. The ''Jordeson'''s provisions were strained by the unexpected passengers, but after a difficult passage on very short rations the ship finally reached its destination on 1 October 1852.<ref>Shermer pp. 72\u201373.</ref><ref name=\"Slotten87-88\">Slotten pp. 84\u201388</ref>\n\nAfter his return to the UK, Wallace spent 18 months in London living on the insurance payment for his lost collection and selling a few specimens that had been shipped back to Britain prior to his starting his exploration of the [[R\u00edo Negro (Argentina)|Rio Negro]] until the Indian town of [[Jativa]] on [[Orinoco River]] basin and as far west as Mic\u00faru ([[Mit\u00fa]]) on the [[Uaup\u00e9s River]]. He was deeply impressed by the grandeur of the virgin forest, by the variety and beauty of the butterflies and birds, and by his first encounter with Indians on the Uaup\u00e9s River area, an experience he never forgot. During this period, despite having lost almost all of the notes from his South American expedition, he wrote six academic papers (which included \"On the Monkeys of the Amazon\") and two books; ''Palm Trees of the Amazon and Their Uses'' and ''Travels on the Amazon''.<ref>Wilson p. 45.</ref> He also made connections with a number of other British naturalists.<ref name=\"Slotten87-88\"/><ref>Raby, Bright Paradise p. 148.</ref><ref name=\"Bibliography\"/>\n\n[[File:Wallace frog.jpg|thumb|left|An illustration from ''The Malay Archipelago'' depicts the [[flying frog]] Wallace discovered.]]\n\nFrom 1854 to 1862, age 31 to 39, Wallace travelled through the Malay Archipelago or [[East Indies]] (now Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia), to collect specimens for sale and to study natural history. A set of 80 bird skeletons he collected in Indonesia and associated documentation can be found in the [[Cambridge University Museum of Zoology]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.zoo.cam.ac.uk/collections.archives/historical.significance/ |title=University Museum of Zoology, Cambridge &#124; Historical significance |publisher=Museum.zoo.cam.ac.uk |date=18 April 2009 |accessdate=13 March 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119040924/https://www.museum.zoo.cam.ac.uk/collections.archives/historical.significance|archivedate=19 November 2010}}</ref> Wallace had as many as a hundred assistants who collected on his behalf. Among these, his most trusted assistant was a Malay by the name of Ali who later called himself [[Ali Wallace (naturalist)|Ali Wallace]]. While Wallace collected insects, many of the bird specimens were collected by his assistants including around 5000 collected and prepared by Ali.<ref name=ali>{{cite journal|doi=10.1353/ras.2015.0012|title='I am Ali Wallace': The Malay Assistant of Alfred Russel Wallace|journal=Journal of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society|volume=88|pages=3\u201331|year=2015|last1=Wyhe|first1=John Van|last2=Drawhorn|first2=Gerrell M.}}</ref> Wallace's observations of the marked zoological differences across a narrow strait in the archipelago led to his proposing the zoogeographical boundary now known as the [[Wallace line]].\n\nWallace collected more than 126,000 specimens in the Malay Archipelago (more than 80,000 beetles alone). Several thousand of them represented species new to science.<ref>Shermer p. 14.</ref> One of his better-known species descriptions during this trip is that of the gliding tree frog ''[[Rhacophorus nigropalmatus]]'', known as Wallace's [[flying frog]]. While he was exploring the archipelago, he refined his thoughts about evolution and had his famous insight on [[natural selection]]. In 1858 he sent an article outlining his theory to Darwin; it was published, along with a description of Darwin's own theory, in the same year.\n\nAccounts of his studies and adventures there were eventually published in 1869 as ''[[The Malay Archipelago]]'', which became one of the most popular books of scientific exploration of the 19th century, and has never been out of print. It was praised by scientists such as Darwin (to whom the book was dedicated), and Charles Lyell, and by non-scientists such as the novelist [[Joseph Conrad]], who called it his \"favorite bedside companion\" and used it as source of information for several of his novels, especially ''[[Lord Jim]]''.<ref>Slotten p. 267.</ref>\n\n===Return to England, marriage and children===\n[[File:Alfred Russel Wallace 1862 - Project Gutenberg eText 15997.png|thumb|upright|A photograph of A.R. Wallace taken in Singapore in 1862]]\n\nIn 1862, Wallace returned to England, where he moved in with his sister Fanny Sims and her husband Thomas. While recovering from his travels, Wallace organised his collections and gave numerous lectures about his adventures and discoveries to scientific societies such as the [[Zoological Society of London]]. Later that year, he visited Darwin at [[Down House]], and became friendly with both Charles Lyell and [[Herbert Spencer]].<ref>Shermer pp. 151\u201352.</ref> During the 1860s, Wallace wrote papers and gave lectures defending natural selection. He also corresponded with Darwin about a variety of topics, including [[sexual selection]], [[warning colouration]], and the possible effect of natural selection on hybridisation and the divergence of species.<ref>Slotten pp. 249\u201358.</ref> In 1865, he began investigating spiritualism.<ref>Slotten p. 235.</ref>\n\nAfter a year of courtship, Wallace became engaged in 1864 to a young woman whom, in his autobiography, he would only identify as Miss L. Miss L. was the daughter of Lewis Leslie who played chess with Wallace.<ref>van Whye, John Dispelling the Darkness, World Scientific, 2013, p. 310.</ref> However, to Wallace's great dismay, she broke off the engagement.<ref>Shermer p. 156.</ref> In 1866, Wallace married Annie Mitten. Wallace had been introduced to Mitten through the botanist Richard Spruce, who had befriended Wallace in Brazil and who was also a good friend of Annie Mitten's father, [[William Mitten]], an expert on mosses. In 1872, Wallace built [[The Dell (Thurrock)|the Dell]], a house of concrete, on land he leased in [[Grays, Essex|Grays]] in Essex, where he lived until 1876. The Wallaces had three children: Herbert (1867\u20131874), Violet (1869\u20131945), and William (1871\u20131951).<ref>Slotten pp. 239\u201340.</ref>\n\n===Financial struggles===\nIn the late 1860s and 1870s, Wallace was very concerned about the financial security of his family. While he was in the Malay Archipelago, the sale of specimens had brought in a considerable amount of money, which had been carefully invested by the agent who sold the specimens for Wallace. However, on his return to the UK, Wallace made a series of bad investments in railways and mines that squandered most of the money, and he found himself badly in need of the proceeds from the publication of ''[[The Malay Archipelago]]''.<ref>Slotten pp. 265\u201367.</ref>\n\nDespite assistance from his friends, he was never able to secure a permanent salaried position such as a curatorship in a museum. To remain financially solvent, Wallace worked grading government examinations, wrote 25 papers for publication between 1872 and 1876 for various modest sums, and was paid by Lyell and Darwin to help edit some of their own works.<ref>Slotten pp. 299\u2013300.</ref>\n\nIn 1876, Wallace needed a \u00a3500 advance from the publisher of ''The Geographical Distribution of Animals'' to avoid having to sell some of his personal property.<ref>Slotten p. 325.</ref> Darwin was very aware of Wallace's financial difficulties and lobbied long and hard to get Wallace awarded a government pension for his lifetime contributions to science. When the [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]200 annual pension was awarded in 1881, it helped to stabilise Wallace's financial position by supplementing the income from his writings.<ref>Slotten pp. 361\u201364.</ref>\n\n===Social activism===\n[[John Stuart Mill]] was impressed by remarks criticising English society that Wallace had included in ''The Malay Archipelago''. Mill asked him to join the general committee of his [[Land Tenure Reform Association]], but the association dissolved after Mill's death in 1873. Wallace had written only a handful of articles on political and social issues between 1873 and 1879 when, at the age of 56, he entered the debates over trade policy and [[land reform]] in earnest. He believed that rural land should be owned by the state and leased to people who would make whatever use of it that would benefit the largest number of people, thus breaking the often-abused power of wealthy landowners in British society.\n\nIn 1881, Wallace was elected as the first president of the newly formed Land Nationalisation Society. In the next year, he published a book, ''Land Nationalisation; Its Necessity and Its Aims'', on the subject. He criticised the UK's [[free trade]] policies for the negative impact they had on working-class people.<ref name=\"Bibliography\">{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred|title=Bibliography of the Writings of Alfred Russel Wallace|url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/index1.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=6 May 2007}}</ref><ref>Slotten pp. 365\u201372.</ref> In 1889, Wallace read ''[[Looking Backward]]'' by [[Edward Bellamy]] and declared himself a socialist, despite his earlier foray as a speculative investor.<ref>Slotten p. 436.</ref> After reading ''[[Progress and Poverty]]'', the best selling book by the progressive land reformist [[Henry George]], Wallace described it as \"Undoubtedly the most remarkable and important book of the present century.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Stanley|first=Buder|title=Visionaries and Planners: The Garden City Movement and the Modern Community|year=1990|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=evBdKUyXY7UC|isbn=9780195362886}}</ref>\n\nWallace opposed [[eugenics]], an idea supported by other prominent 19th-century evolutionary thinkers, on the grounds that contemporary society was too corrupt and unjust to allow any reasonable determination of who was fit or unfit.<ref>Slotten pp. 436\u201338.</ref> In the 1890 article \"Human Selection\" he wrote, \"Those who succeed in the race for wealth are by no means the best or the most intelligent&nbsp;...\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred|title=Human Selection (S427: 1890)|url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S427.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=27 May 2012}}</ref> In 1898, Wallace wrote a paper advocating a [[Fiat money|pure paper money system, not backed by silver or gold]], which impressed the economist [[Irving Fisher]] so much that he dedicated his 1920 book ''Stabilizing the Dollar'' to Wallace.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred|title=Paper Money as a Standard of Value (S557: 1898)|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/S557.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=6 May 2007}}</ref>\n\nWallace wrote on other social and political topics including his support for [[women's suffrage]], and repeatedly on the dangers and wastefulness of [[militarism]].<ref>Slotten pp. 366, 453, 487\u201388.</ref><ref>Shermer pp. 23, 279.</ref> In an essay published in 1899 Wallace called for popular opinion to be rallied against warfare by showing people: \"...that all modern wars are dynastic; that they are caused by the ambition, the interests, the jealousies, and the insatiable greed of power of their rulers, or of the great mercantile and financial classes which have power and influence over their rulers; and that the results of war are never good for the people, who yet bear all its burthens\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred|title=The Causes of War, and the Remedies (S567: 1899)|url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S567.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=22 November 2015}}</ref> In a letter published by the [[Daily Mail]] in 1909, with aviation in its infancy, he advocated an international treaty to ban the military use of aircraft, arguing against the idea \"...that this new horror is \"inevitable,\" and that all we can do is to be sure and be in the front rank of the aerial assassins\u2014for surely no other term can so fitly describe the dropping of, say, ten thousand bombs at midnight into an enemy's capital from an invisible flight of airships.\"<ref>{{cite web | last=Wallace | first=Alfred| title=Flying Machines in War.

The first part of the book covered the major scientific and technical advances of the century; the second part covered what Wallace considered to be its social failures including: the destruction and waste of wars and arms races, the rise of the urban poor and the dangerous conditions in which they lived and worked, a harsh criminal justice system that failed to reform criminals, abuses in a mental health system based on privately owned sanatoriums, the environmental damage caused by capitalism, and the evils of European colonialism.<ref>Slotten pp. 453\u201355.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Wallace|first=Alfred|title=''The Wonderful Century: Its successes and failures|url=https://archive.org/details/wonderfulcentur03wallgoog|accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref> Wallace continued his social activism for the rest of his life, publishing the book ''The Revolt of Democracy'' just weeks before his death.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred|title=The Revolt of Democracy (S734: 1913)|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/S734.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=6 May 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Further scientific work===\nWallace continued his scientific work in parallel with his social commentary. In 1880, he published ''Island Life'' as a sequel to ''The Geographic Distribution of Animals''. In November 1886, Wallace began a ten-month trip to the United States to give a series of popular lectures. Most of the lectures were on Darwinism (evolution through natural selection), but he also gave speeches on [[biogeography]], spiritualism, and socio-economic reform. During the trip, he was reunited with his brother John who had emigrated to California years before. He also spent a week in Colorado, with the American botanist [[Alice Eastwood]] as his guide, exploring the flora of the [[Rocky Mountains]] and gathering evidence that would lead him to a theory on how [[glaciation]] might explain certain commonalities between the mountain flora of Europe, Asia and North America, which he published in 1891 in the paper \"English and American Flowers\". He met many other prominent American naturalists and viewed their collections. His 1889 book ''[[Darwinism (book)|Darwinism]]'' used information he collected on his American trip and information he had compiled for the lectures.<ref>Shermer pp. 274\u201378.</ref><ref>Slotten pp. 379\u2013400.</ref>\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Restored grave of AR Wallace.jpg|thumb|upright|Wallace's grave in Broadstone Cemetery, [[Broadstone, Dorset]], which was restored by the A.

It features a {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=on}} tall [[Petrified wood|fossil tree trunk]] from Portland mounted on a block of [[Purbeck limestone]].]]\n\nOn 7 November 1913, Wallace died at home in the country house he called Old Orchard, which he had built a decade earlier.<ref name=\"Slotten490\">Slotten p. 490.</ref> He was 90 years old. His death was widely reported in the press. ''[[The New York Times]]'' called him \"the last of the giants belonging to that wonderful group of intellectuals that included, among others, Darwin, Huxley, Spencer, Lyell, and Owen, whose daring investigations revolutionised and evolutionised the thought of the century.\" Another commentator in the same edition said: \"No apology need be made for the few literary or scientific follies of the author of that great book on the 'Malay Archipelago'.\"<ref>Slotten p. 491.</ref>\n\nSome of Wallace's friends suggested that he be buried in [[Westminster Abbey]], but his wife followed his wishes and had him buried in the small cemetery at [[Broadstone, Dorset]].<ref name=\"Slotten490\"/> Several prominent British scientists formed a committee to have a medallion of Wallace placed in Westminster Abbey near where Darwin had been buried. The medallion was unveiled on 1 November 1915.\n\n==Theory of evolution==\n\n===Early evolutionary thinking===\nUnlike Darwin, Wallace began his career as a travelling naturalist already believing in the [[transmutation of species]]. The concept had been advocated by [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]], [[\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire|Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]], [[Erasmus Darwin]], and [[Robert Edmond Grant|Robert Grant]], among others. It was widely discussed, but not generally accepted by leading naturalists, and was considered to have [[radicalism (historical)|radical]], even revolutionary connotations.<ref name=\"Larson73\">Larson Evolution p. 73.</ref><ref>Peter J. Bowler, Iwan Rhys Morus. ''Making Modern Science: A Historical Survey''. University of Chicago Press, 2005, p. 141</ref>\n\nProminent anatomists and geologists such as [[Georges Cuvier]], [[Richard Owen]], [[Adam Sedgwick]], and [[Charles Lyell]] attacked it vigorously.<ref>McGowan The Dragon Seekers pp. 101, 154\u201355.</ref><ref>Larson pp. 23\u201324, 37\u201338.</ref> It has been suggested that Wallace accepted the idea of the transmutation of species in part because he was always inclined to favour radical ideas in politics, religion and science,<ref name=\"Larson73\"/> and because he was unusually open to marginal, even fringe, ideas in science.<ref name=\"Shermer p. 54\">Shermer p. 54.</ref>\n\nHe was also profoundly influenced by [[Robert Chambers (journalist)|Robert Chambers]]' work, ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]'', a highly controversial work of popular science published anonymously in 1844 that advocated an evolutionary origin for the solar system, the earth, and living things.<ref>Slotten p. 31.</ref> Wallace wrote to Henry Bates in 1845:\n\n{{quote|I have a rather more favourable opinion of the 'Vestiges' than you appear to have. I do not consider it a hasty generalization, but rather as an ingenious hypothesis strongly supported by some striking facts and analogies, but which remains to be proven by more facts and the additional light which more research may throw upon the problem. It furnishes a subject for every student of nature to attend to; every fact he observes will make either for or against it, and it thus serves both as an incitement to the collection of facts, and an object to which they can be applied when collected.<ref name=\"Shermer p. 54\"/>}}\n\nIn 1847, he wrote to Bates:\n{{quote|I should like to take some one family [of beetles] to study thoroughly, principally with a view to the theory of the origin of species. By that means I am strongly of opinion that some definite results might be arrived at.<ref>\nWallace Family Archive, 11 Oct. 1847, quoted in {{harvnb|Raby|2002|p=1}}.\n</ref>}}\n\nWallace deliberately planned some of his fieldwork to test the hypothesis that under an evolutionary scenario closely related species should inhabit neighbouring territories.<ref name=\"Larson73\"/> During his work in the Amazon basin, he came to realise that geographical barriers\u2014such as the Amazon and its major tributaries\u2014often separated the ranges of closely allied species, and he included these observations in his 1853 paper \"On the Monkeys of the Amazon\".<ref>Slotten p. 94.</ref> Near the end of the paper he asks the question, \"Are very closely allied species ever separated by a wide interval of country?\"\n\nIn February 1855, while working in [[Sarawak]] on the island of [[Borneo]], Wallace wrote \"On the Law which has Regulated the Introduction of New Species\", a paper which was published in the ''[[Journal of Natural History|Annals and Magazine of Natural History]]'' in September 1855.<ref>{{cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = Wallace Collection \u2013 Wallace's 'Sarawak law' paper | url = http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/collections-at-the-museum/wallace-collection/closeup.jsp?itemID=138&theme=Evolution | publisher = [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] | year = 2012 | accessdate = 14 February 2012 }}</ref> In this paper, he discussed observations regarding the geographic and geologic distribution of both living and fossil species, what would become known as [[biogeography]]. His conclusion that \"Every species has come into existence coincident both in space and time with a closely allied species\" has come to be known as the \"Sarawak Law\". Wallace thus answered the question he had posed in his earlier paper on the monkeys of the Amazon river basin. Although it contained no mention of any possible mechanisms for evolution, this paper foreshadowed the momentous paper he would write three years later.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred Russel|title=On the Law Which has Regulated the Introduction of Species|url=http://www.wku.edu/%7Esmithch/wallace/S020.htm|year=1855|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=8 May 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070428194531/http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/S020.htm| archivedate= 28 April 2007 |url-status = live}}</ref>\n\nThe paper shook Charles Lyell's belief that species were immutable. Although his friend Charles Darwin had written to him in 1842 expressing support for transmutation, Lyell had continued to be strongly opposed to the idea. Around the start of 1856, he told Darwin about Wallace's paper, as did [[Edward Blyth]] who thought it \"Good! Upon the whole!&nbsp;... Wallace has, I think put the matter well; and according to his theory the various domestic races of animals have been fairly developed into ''species''.\" Despite this hint, Darwin mistook Wallace's conclusion for the [[progressive creationism]] of the time and wrote that it was \"nothing very new&nbsp;... Uses my simile of tree [but] it seems all creation with him.\" Lyell was more impressed and opened a notebook on species, in which he grappled with the consequences, particularly for human ancestry. Darwin had already shown his theory to their mutual friend [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Joseph Hooker]] and now, for the first time, he spelt out the full details of [[natural selection]] to Lyell. Although Lyell could not agree, he urged Darwin to publish to establish priority. Darwin demurred at first, then began writing up a ''species sketch'' of his continuing work in May 1856.<ref>Desmond & Moore ''Darwin'' 1991, p. 438;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Browne ''Charles Darwin: Voyaging'' pp. 537\u201346.</ref>\n\n===Natural selection and Darwin===\n{{see also|Publication of Darwin's theory}}\n\nBy February 1858, Wallace had been convinced by his biogeographical research in the Malay Archipelago that evolution was real. He later wrote in his autobiography:\n\n{{quote|The problem then was not only how and why do species change, but how and why do they change into new and well-defined species, distinguished from each other in so many ways; why and how they become so exactly adapted to distinct modes of life; and why do all the intermediate grades die out (as geology shows they have died out) and leave only clearly defined and well-marked species, genera, and higher groups of animals?<ref>Wallace ''My Life'' p. 361.</ref>}}\n\nAccording to his autobiography, it was while he was in bed with a fever that Wallace thought about [[Thomas Robert Malthus|Malthus]]'s idea of positive checks on human population and had the idea of [[natural selection]].<ref>Slotten pp. 144\u201345.</ref> His autobiography says that he was on the island of [[Ternate]] at the time; but historians have said that based on his journal he was on the island of [[Halmahera|Gilolo]].<ref>Slotten p. 144.</ref> From 1858 to 1861, he rented a house on Ternate from the Dutchman [[Maarten Dirk van Renesse van Duivenbode]], which he used as a base for expeditions to other islands such as Gilolo.<ref>Heij, dr.

Vaguely thinking over the enormous and constant destruction which this implied, it occurred to me to ask the question, why do some die and some live?

In this way every part of an animals organization could be modified exactly as required, and in the very process of this modification the unmodified would die out, and thus the definite characters and the clear isolation of each new species would be explained.''<ref>Wallace ''My Life'' pp. 361\u201362.</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Darwin-Wallace medal.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Darwin\u2013Wallace Medal]] was issued by the Linnean society on the 50th anniversary of the reading of Darwin and Wallace's papers on [[natural selection]].]]\n\nWallace had once briefly met Darwin, and was one of the correspondents whose observations Darwin used to support his own theories. Although Wallace's first letter to Darwin has been lost, Wallace carefully kept the letters he received.<ref>Marchant, 1916. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1593&viewtype=image&pageseq=116 p. 105]</ref> In the first letter, dated 1 May 1857, Darwin commented that Wallace's letter of 10 October which he had recently received, as well as Wallace's paper \"On the Law which has regulated the Introduction of New Species\" of 1855, showed that they thought alike, with similar conclusions, and said that he was preparing his own work for publication in about two years time.<ref>Darwin, Francis, 1887, ''The life and letters of Charles Darwin'' [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1452.2&viewtype=text&pageseq=111 p. 95]</ref> The second letter, dated 22 December 1857, said how glad he was that Wallace was theorising about distribution, adding that \"without speculation there is no good and original observation\" but commented that \"I believe I go much further than you\".<ref>Darwin, Francis, 1887, ''The life and letters of Charles Darwin'' [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1452.2&viewtype=text&pageseq=124 p. 108]</ref> Wallace believed this and sent Darwin his February 1858 essay, \"[[On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection|On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely From the Original Type]]\", asking Darwin to review it and pass it to [[Charles Lyell]] if he thought it worthwhile.<ref name=\"tendency\">{{cite web|last=Wallace |first=Alfred |title=On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely From the Original Type |url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/S043.htm |publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]] |accessdate=22 April 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429183411/http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/S043.htm |archivedate=29 April 2007 |url-status = live|df= }}</ref> Although Wallace had sent several articles for journal publication during his travels through the Malay archipelago, the Ternate essay was in a private letter. Darwin received the essay on 18 June 1858. Although the essay did not use Darwin's term \"natural selection\", it did outline the mechanics of an evolutionary divergence of species from similar ones due to environmental pressures. In this sense, it was very similar to the theory that Darwin had worked on for 20 years, but had yet to publish. Darwin sent the manuscript to Charles Lyell with a letter saying \"he could not have made a better short abstract! Even his terms now stand as heads of my chapters&nbsp;... he does not say he wishes me to publish, but I shall, of course, at once write and offer to send to any journal.\"<ref>Slotten pp. 153\u201354<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Darwin, Francis, 1887, ''The life and letters of Charles Darwin'' [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1452.2&viewtype=text&pageseq=132 p. 116]</ref> Distraught about the illness of his baby son, Darwin put the problem to Charles Lyell and [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Joseph Hooker]], who decided to publish the essay in a joint presentation together with unpublished writings which highlighted Darwin's priority. Wallace's essay was presented to the [[Linnean Society of London]] on 1 July 1858, along with excerpts from an essay which Darwin had disclosed privately to Hooker in 1847 and a letter Darwin had written to [[Asa Gray]] in 1857.<ref>Browne ''Charles Darwin: The Power of Place'' pp. 33\u201342.</ref>\n\nCommunication with Wallace in the far-off Malay Archipelago involved months of delay, so he was not part of this rapid publication. Wallace accepted the arrangement after the fact, happy that he had been included at all, and never expressed bitterness in public or in private. Darwin's social and scientific status was far greater than Wallace's, and it was unlikely that, without Darwin, Wallace's views on evolution would have been taken seriously. Lyell and Hooker's arrangement relegated Wallace to the position of co-discoverer, and he was not the social equal of Darwin or the other prominent British natural scientists. However, the joint reading of their papers on natural selection associated Wallace with the more famous Darwin. This, combined with Darwin's (as well as Hooker's and Lyell's) advocacy on his behalf, would give Wallace greater access to the highest levels of the scientific community.<ref>Shermer pp. 148\u201350.</ref> The reaction to the reading was muted, with the president of the Linnean Society remarking in May 1859 that the year had not been marked by any striking discoveries;<ref>Browne ''Charles Darwin: The Power of Place'' pp. 40\u201342.</ref> but, with Darwin's publication of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' later in 1859, its significance became apparent. When Wallace returned to the UK, he met Darwin. Although some of Wallace's iconoclastic opinions in the ensuing years would test Darwin's patience, they remained on friendly terms for the rest of Darwin's life.\n\nOver the years, a few people have questioned this version of events. In the early 1980s, two books, one written by Arnold Brackman and another by John Langdon Brooks, even suggested not only that there had been a conspiracy to rob Wallace of his proper credit, but that Darwin had actually stolen a key idea from Wallace to finish his own theory. These claims have been examined in detail by a number of scholars who have not found them convincing.<ref>Slotten pp. 157\u201362.</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Shermer|first=Michael|title=In Darwin's Shadow: Excerpt|url=http://www.michaelshermer.com/darwins-shadow/excerpt/|publisher=michaelshermer.com|accessdate=29 April 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Charles|title=Responses to Questions Frequently Asked About Wallace: Did Darwin really steal material from Wallace to complete his theory of natural selection?|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/FAQ.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=29 April 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080509183747/http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/FAQ.htm| archivedate= 9 May 2008 |url-status = live}}</ref> Shipping schedules show that, contrary to these accusations, Wallace's letter could not have been delivered earlier than the date shown in Darwin's letter to Lyell.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wyhe |first=John Van |last2=Rookmaaker |first2=Kees |year=2012 |title=A new theory to explain the receipt of Wallace's Ternate Essay by Darwin in 1858 |url= |journal= Biological Journal of the Linnean Society|volume=105  |pages=249\u2013252 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.2011.01808.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal  | last = Ball | first = Philip | title = Shipping timetables debunk Darwin plagiarism accusations   | journal = Nature | url = http://www.nature.com/news/shipping-timetables-debunk-darwin-plagiarism-accusations-1.9613 | date = 12 December 2011 | accessdate = 26 February 2012 | doi = 10.1038/nature.2011.9613 }}</ref>\n\n====Defence of Darwin and his ideas====\nAfter Wallace returned to England in 1862, he became one of the staunchest defenders of Darwin's ''On the Origin of Species''. In one incident in 1863 that particularly pleased Darwin, Wallace published the short paper \"Remarks on the Rev. S. Haughton's Paper on the Bee's Cell, And on the Origin of Species\" to rebut a paper by a professor of geology at the University of Dublin that had sharply criticised Darwin's comments in the ''Origin'' on how hexagonal honey bee cells could have evolved through natural selection.<ref>Slotten pp. 197\u201399.</ref>\n\nAn even longer defence was a 1867 article in the ''[[Quarterly Journal of Science]]'' called \"Creation by Law\". It reviewed the book ''The Reign of Law'' by [[George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll|George Campbell]], the 8th Duke of Argyll which aimed to refute natural selection.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred|title=Creation by Law (S140: 1867)\n|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/S140.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=23 May 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070602121908/http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/S140.htm| archivedate= 2 June 2007 |url-status = live}}</ref>\n\nAfter an 1870 meeting of the [[British Science Association]], Wallace wrote to Darwin complaining that there were \"no opponents left who know anything of natural history, so that there are none of the good discussions we used to have.\"<ref>Slotten p. 261.</ref>\n\n====Differences between Darwin's and Wallace's ideas on natural selection====\nHistorians of science have noted that, while Darwin considered the ideas in Wallace's paper to be essentially the same as his own, there were differences.<ref>{{Cite journal | last=Kutschera | first1=U. | title=A comparative analysis of the Darwin\u2013Wallace papers and the development of the concept of natural selection | journal=Theory in Biosciences | date=19 December 2003 | doi=10.1007/s12064-003-0063-6 | volume=122 | issue=4 | pages=343\u201359 }}</ref> Darwin emphasised competition between individuals of the same species to survive and reproduce, whereas Wallace emphasised environmental pressures on varieties and species forcing them to become adapted to their local conditions, leading populations in different locations to diverge.<ref>Larson p. 75.</ref><ref>Bowler & Morus p. 149.</ref> Some historians, notably [[Peter J.

Darwin had come to believe that many conspicuous animal colour schemes were due to [[sexual selection]]. However, this could not apply to caterpillars. Wallace responded that he and [[Henry Walter Bates|Henry Bates]] had observed that many of the most spectacular butterflies had a peculiar odour and taste, and that he had been told by [[John Jenner Weir]] that birds would not eat a certain kind of common white moth because they found it unpalatable. \"Now, as the white moth is as conspicuous at dusk as a coloured caterpillar in the daylight\", it seemed likely that the conspicuous colours served as a warning to predators and thus could have evolved through natural selection. Darwin was impressed by the idea. At a later meeting of the Entomological Society, Wallace asked for any evidence anyone might have on the topic.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Frederick|date=1867|title=March 4,1867|journal=Transactions of the Royal Entomological Society of London|volume=15|issue=7|pages=509\u2013566|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2311.1967.tb01466.x}}</ref> In 1869, Weir published data from experiments and observations involving brightly coloured caterpillars that supported Wallace's idea.  \n\nWallace attributed less importance than Darwin to sexual selection.

In it, he proposed the hypothesis that natural selection could drive the reproductive isolation of two varieties by encouraging the development of barriers against hybridisation. Thus it might contribute to the development of new species. He suggested the following scenario: When two populations of a species had diverged beyond a certain point, each adapted to particular conditions, hybrid offspring would be less adapted than either parent form and so natural selection would tend to eliminate the hybrids. Furthermore, under such conditions, natural selection would favour the development of barriers to hybridisation, as individuals that avoided hybrid matings would tend to have more fit offspring, and thus contribute to the reproductive isolation of the two incipient species. \n\nThis idea came to be known as the [[Wallace effect]],<ref>Slotten pp. 413\u201315.</ref> later referred to as [[Reinforcement (speciation)|reinforcement]].<ref name=\"Speciation\">{{Citation | title=Speciation | author=Jerry A.

Darwin had not yet publicly addressed the subject, although [[Thomas Huxley]] had in ''[[Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature]]''. He explained the apparent stability of the human stock by pointing to the vast gap in cranial capacities between humans and the great apes. Unlike some other Darwinists, including Darwin himself, he did not \"regard modern primitives as almost filling the gap between man and ape\".<ref name=eiseley>{{cite book |last=Eiseley |first=Loren |title=Darwin's Century |publisher=Anchor Book |year=1958 |pages=305, 06}}</ref> \n\nHe saw the evolution of humans in two stages: achieving a bipedal posture freeing the hands to carry out the dictates of the brain, and the \"recognition of the human brain as a totally new factor in the history of life. Wallace was apparently the first evolutionist to recognize clearly that&nbsp;... with the emergence of that bodily specialization which constitutes the human brain, bodily specialization itself might be said to be outmoded.\"<ref name=eiseley /> For this paper he won Darwin's praise.\n\nShortly afterwards, Wallace became a [[spiritualism|spiritualist]]. At about the same time, he began to maintain that natural selection cannot account for mathematical, artistic, or musical genius, as well as metaphysical musings, and wit and humour. He eventually said that something in \"the unseen universe of Spirit\" had interceded at least three times in history. The first was the creation of life from inorganic matter. The second was the introduction of consciousness in the higher animals. And the third was the generation of the higher mental faculties in humankind. He also believed that the [[wikt:raison d'\u00eatre|raison d'\u00eatre]] of the universe was the development of the human spirit.<ref>Wallace ''Darwinism'' p. 477.</ref> These views greatly disturbed Darwin, who argued that spiritual appeals were not necessary and that [[sexual selection]] could easily explain apparently non-adaptive mental phenomena. \n\nWhile some historians have concluded that Wallace's belief that natural selection was insufficient to explain the development of consciousness and the human mind was directly caused by his adoption of spiritualism, other Wallace scholars have disagreed, and some maintain that Wallace never believed natural selection applied to those areas.<ref>Shermer pp. 157\u201360.</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Charles H.|title=Alfred Russel Wallace: Evolution of an Evolutionist Chapter Six.

One historian of science has pointed out that, through both private correspondence and published works, Darwin and Wallace exchanged knowledge and stimulated each other's ideas and theories over an extended period.<ref>Shermer p. 149.</ref> Wallace is the most-cited naturalist in Darwin's ''[[Descent of Man]]'', occasionally in strong disagreement.<ref>Slotten pp. 289\u201390.</ref>\n\nBoth Darwin and Wallace agreed on the importance of natural selection, and some of the factors responsible for it: competition between species and geographical isolation. But Wallace believed that evolution had a purpose (\"teleology\") in maintaining species' fitness to their environment, whereas Darwin hesitated to attribute any purpose to a random natural process. Scientific discoveries since the 19th century support Darwin's viewpoint, by identifying several additional mechanisms and triggers:\n* Mutations in germ-line DNA (i.e., DNA of the sperm or egg, which manifest in the offspring). These occur spontaneously, or are triggered by environmental radiation or mutagenic chemicals. A recently discovered mechanism, which is likely to be more important than the others combined, is infections with viruses, which integrate their DNA into their hosts.<ref>Garry Hamilton.

Most of the mutations are harmful or lethal to the offspring, but a very small minority turn out to be advantageous, as novel proteins get produced that serve new functions.\n* [[Epigenetic]] mechanisms, where evolution can occur in the absence of change in DNA sequence, through various mechanisms including chemical modifications to the DNA bases.\n* Cataclysmic events (meteorite/asteroid impacts, volcanism) that cause [[mass extinction]]s of species that, until the event, were perfectly adapted to their environment, such as the dinosaurs. The dramatic reduction of competition among the surviving species makes newly evolved species more likely to survive.\n\nWallace remained an ardent defender of natural selection for the rest of his life. By the 1880s, evolution was widely accepted in scientific circles, but natural selection less so.  In 1889, Wallace published the book ''[[Darwinism (book)|Darwinism]]'' as a response to the scientific critics of natural selection.<ref>Slotten p. 409.</ref> Of all Wallace's books, it is the most cited by scholarly publications.<ref>Shermer p. 18.</ref>\n\n==Other scientific contributions==\n\n===Biogeography and ecology===\n[[File:Wallace03.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A map of the world from ''The Geographical Distribution of Animals'' shows Wallace's six biogeographical regions.]]\n\nIn 1872, at the urging of many of his friends, including Darwin, [[Philip Sclater]], and [[Alfred Newton]], Wallace began research for a general review of the geographic distribution of animals. Initial progres was slow, in part because classification systems for many types of animals were in flux.<ref>Slotten p. 301.</ref> He resumed the work in earnest in 1874 after the publication of a number of new works on classification.<ref>Slotten p. 315.</ref> Extending the system developed by Sclater for birds\u2014which divided the earth into six separate geographic regions for describing species distribution\u2014to cover mammals, reptiles and insects as well, Wallace created the basis for the [[ecozone|zoogeographic regions]] still in use today. He discussed all of the factors then known to influence the current and past geographic distribution of animals within each geographic region. \n\nThese factors included the effects of the appearance and disappearance of land bridges (such as the one currently [[Great American Interchange|connecting North America and South America]]) and the effects of periods of increased glaciation. He provided maps showing factors, such as elevation of mountains, depths of oceans, and the character of regional vegetation, that affected the distribution of animals. He also summarised all the known families and genera of the higher animals and listed their known geographic distributions. The text was organised so that it would be easy for a traveller to learn what animals could be found in a particular location. The resulting two-volume work, ''The Geographical Distribution of Animals'', was published in 1876 and served as the definitive text on [[zoogeography]] for the next 80 years.<ref>Slotten pp. 320\u201325.</ref>\n\nThe book included evidence from the fossil record to discuss the processes of evolution and migration that had led to the geographical distribution of modern species. For example, he discussed how fossil evidence showed that [[tapirs]] had originated in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], migrating between North America and Eurasia and then, much more recently, to South America after which the northern species became extinct, leaving the modern distribution of two isolated groups of tapir species in South America and Southeast Asia.<ref>Bowler (2013), p. 152.</ref> Wallace was very aware of, and interested in, the [[Quaternary extinction event|mass extinction of megafauna]] in the late [[Pleistocene]]. In ''The Geographical Distribution of Animals'' (1876) he wrote, \"We live in a zoologically impoverished world, from which all the hugest, and fiercest, and strangest forms have recently disappeared\".<ref>Wallace ''The Geographical Distribution of Animals'' p. 150.</ref> He added that he believed the most likely cause for the rapid extinctions was glaciation, but by the time he wrote ''World of Life'' (1911) he had come to believe those extinctions were \"due to man's agency\".<ref>Wallace ''The World of Life'' (1911) p. 264.</ref>\n[[File:Wallace-line1.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.7|The line separating the Indo-Malayan and the Austro-Malayan region in Wallace's ''On the Physical Geography of the Malay Archipelago'' (1863)]]\nIn 1880, Wallace published the book ''Island Life'' as a sequel to ''The Geographical Distribution of Animals''. It surveyed the distribution of both animal and plant species on islands. Wallace classified islands into oceanic and two types of continental islands. \n\nOceanic islands, such as the [[Galapagos]] and [[Hawaiian Islands]] (then called Sandwich Islands) formed in mid-ocean and never part of any large continent. Such islands were characterised by a complete lack of terrestrial mammals and amphibians, and their inhabitants (except migratory birds and species introduced by humans) were typically the result of accidental colonisation and subsequent evolution.  \n\nContinental islands were divided into those that were recently separated from a continent (like Britain) and those much less recently (like [[Madagascar]]). Wallace discussed how that difference affected flora and fauna. He discussed how isolation affected evolution and how that could result in the preservation of classes of animals, such as the [[lemur]]s of Madagascar that were remnants of once widespread continental faunas. He extensively discussed how changes of climate, particularly periods of increased [[glaciation]], may have affected the distribution of flora and fauna on some islands, and the first portion of the book discusses possible causes of these great [[ice age]]s. ''Island Life'' was considered a very important work at the time of its publication. It was discussed extensively in scientific circles both in published reviews and in private correspondence.<ref>Slotten p. 361.</ref> \n\n===Environmental issues===\nWallace's extensive work in biogeography made him aware of the impact of human activities on the natural world. In ''Tropical Nature and Other Essays'' (1878), he warned about the dangers of deforestation and soil erosion, especially in tropical climates prone to heavy rainfall. Noting the complex interactions between vegetation and climate, he warned that the extensive clearing of [[rainforest]] for coffee cultivation in Ceylon (now called [[Sri Lanka]]) and India would adversely impact the climate in those countries and lead to their impoverishment due to soil erosion.<ref>Slotten pp. 352\u201353.</ref> In ''Island Life'', Wallace again mentioned deforestation and [[invasive species]]. On the impact of European colonisation on the island of [[Saint Helena]], he wrote:\n\n{{quote|&nbsp;yet the general aspect of the island is now so barren and forbidding that some persons find it difficult to believe that it was once all green and fertile. The cause of this change is, however, very easily explained. The rich soil formed by decomposed volcanic rock and vegetable deposits could only be retained on the steep slopes so long as it was protected by the vegetation to which it in great part owed its origin. When this was destroyed, the heavy tropical rains soon washed away the soil, and has left a vast expanse of bare rock or sterile clay. This irreparable destruction was caused, in the first place, by goats, which were introduced by the Portuguese in 1513, and increased so rapidly that in 1588 they existed in the thousands. These animals are the greatest of all foes to trees, because they eat off the young seedlings, and thus prevent the natural restoration of the forest. They were, however, aided by the reckless waste of man. The East India Company took possession of the island in 1651, and about the year 1700 it began to be seen that the forests were fast diminishing, and required some protection. Two of the native trees, redwood and ebony, were good for tanning, and, to save trouble, the bark was wastefully stripped from the trunks only, the remainder being left to rot; while in 1709 a large quantity of the rapidly disappearing ebony was used to burn lime for building fortifications!<ref>Wallace ''Island Life'' pp. 283\u201384.</ref>}}\n\nWallace's comments on environment grew more strident later in his career. In ''The World of Life'' (1911) he wrote:\n\n{{quote| These considerations should lead us to look upon all the works of nature, animate or inanimate, as invested with a certain sanctity, to be used by us but not abused, and never to be recklessly destroyed or defaced. To pollute a spring or a river, to exterminate a bird or beast, should be treated as moral offences and as social crimes;&nbsp;... Yet during the past century, which has seen those great advances in the knowledge of Nature of which we are so proud, there has been no corresponding development of a love or reverence for her works; so that never before has there been such widespread ravage of the earth's surface by destruction of native vegetation and with it of much animal life, and such wholesale defacement of the earth by mineral workings and by pouring into our streams and rivers the refuse of manufactories and of cities; and this has been done by all the greatest nations claiming the first place for civilisation and religion!<ref>Wallace ''World of Life'' p. 279.</ref>}}\n\n===Astrobiology===\nWallace's 1904 book ''Man's Place in the Universe'' was the first serious attempt by a biologist to evaluate the [[planetary habitability|likelihood of life on other planets]]. He concluded that the Earth was the only planet in the solar system that could possibly support life, mainly because it was the only one in which water could exist in the [[liquid phase]]. More controversially he maintained that it was unlikely that other stars in the galaxy could have planets with the necessary properties (the existence of other galaxies not having been proved at the time).\n\nHis treatment of [[Mars]] in this book was brief, and in 1907, Wallace returned to the subject with a book ''Is Mars Habitable?'' to criticise the claims made by [[Percival Lowell]] that there were [[Martian canals]] built by intelligent beings. Wallace did months of research, consulted various experts, and produced his own scientific analysis of the Martian climate and atmospheric conditions.<ref>Slotten p. 474.</ref> Among other things, Wallace pointed out that [[spectroscopic analysis]] had shown no signs of [[water vapour]] in the [[Martian atmosphere]], that Lowell's analysis of Mars's climate was seriously flawed and badly overestimated the surface temperature, and that low atmospheric pressure would make liquid water, let alone a planet-girding irrigation system, impossible.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred|title=''Is Mars Habitable'' (S730: 1907)|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/S730.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=13 May 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070405172431/http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/S730.htm| archivedate= 5 April 2007 |url-status = live}}</ref> Richard Milner comments: \"It was the brilliant and eccentric evolutionist Alfred Russel Wallace&nbsp;... who effectively debunked Lowell's illusionary network of Martian canals.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=A Wet Red World?

Stately palm-trees rise\n\nOn every side, and numerous trees unknown\n\nSave by strange names uncouth to English ears.\n\nHere I dwelt awhile the one white man\n\nAmong perhaps two hundred living souls.\n\nThey pass a peaceful and contented life'\n\nThe poem is a lyrical description of the life of a tribe he was living with along the Amazon river. While it has echoes of [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]] in the rhymes and rhythms the poem itself is not overly Romantic, serving more as a tool to set the scene and then draw contrast between the lives of the people living here and those in England. The poem is a comment on savagery and greed, making the point that some in England were more 'savage' than those on the Amazon, either by a greed for gold or by their greed for gold driving others into poverty.\n\nWallace concludes:\n\nI'd be an Indian here, and live content\n\nTo fish, and hunt, and paddle my canoe,\n\nAnd see my children grow, like young wild fawns,\n\nIn health of body and in peace of mind,\n\nRich without wealth, and happy without gold !\n\nThe poem is referenced and partially recited in the BBC television series '[[The Ascent of Man]]'.\n\n==Controversies==\n\n===Spiritualism<!--linked from 'Spiritualism (philosophy)'-->===\nIn a letter to his brother-in-law in 1861, Wallace wrote:\n\n{{quote|&nbsp;I remain an utter disbeliever in almost all that you consider the most sacred truths. I will pass over as utterly contemptible the oft-repeated accusation that sceptics shut out evidence because they will not be governed by the morality of Christianity&nbsp;... I am thankful I can see much to admire in all religions. To the mass of mankind religion of some kind is a necessity. But whether there be a God and whatever be His nature; whether we have an immortal soul or not, or whatever may be our state after death, I can have no fear of having to suffer for the study of nature and the search for truth, or believe that those will be better off in a future state who have lived in the belief of doctrines inculcated from childhood, and which are to them rather a matter of blind faith than intelligent conviction.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred|title=1861 Letter from Wallace to Thomas Sims|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/quotes.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=4 April 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070220201439/http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/quotes.htm| archivedate= 20 February 2007 <!--DASHBot-->|url-status = live}}</ref>}}\n\nWallace was an enthusiast of [[phrenology]].<ref>Slotten pp. 203\u201305.</ref> Early in his career, he experimented with [[hypnosis]], then known as [[mesmerism]].

In 1893, he wrote:\n\n{{quote|I thus learnt my first great lesson in the inquiry into these obscure fields of knowledge, never to accept the disbelief of great men or their accusations of imposture or of imbecility, as of any weight when opposed to the repeated observation of facts by other men, admittedly sane and honest.

For the rest of his life, he remained convinced that at least some s\u00e9ance phenomena were genuine, no matter how many accusations of fraud sceptics made or how much evidence of trickery was produced. Historians and biographers have disagreed about which factors most influenced his adoption of spiritualism. It has been suggested by one biographer that the emotional shock he had received a few months earlier, when his first fianc\u00e9e broke their engagement, contributed to his receptiveness to spiritualism.<ref>Slotten p. 236.</ref> Other scholars have preferred to emphasise instead Wallace's desire to find rational and scientific explanations for all phenomena, both material and non-material, of the natural world and of human society.<ref name=\"Belief and Spiritualism\"/><ref name=\"Shermer199201\">Shermer pp. 199\u2013201.</ref>\n\nSpiritualism appealed to many educated [[Victorian morality|Victorians]] who no longer found traditional religious doctrine, such as that of the [[Church of England]], acceptable yet were unsatisfied with the completely materialistic and mechanical view of the world that was increasingly emerging from 19th-century science.<ref name = \"Slotten_p4\">Slotten p. 4.</ref> However, several scholars who have researched Wallace's views in depth have emphasised that, for him, spiritualism was a matter of science and philosophy rather than religious belief.<ref name=\"Belief and Spiritualism\"/><ref name=\"Shermer199201\"/> Among other prominent 19th-century intellectuals involved with spiritualism were the social reformer [[Robert Owen]], who was one of Wallace's early idols,<ref>Slotten p. 232.</ref> the physicists [[William Crookes]] and [[Lord Rayleigh]], the mathematician [[Augustus De Morgan]], and the Scottish publisher [[Robert Chambers (journalist)|Robert Chambers]].<ref name = \"Slotten_p4\"/><ref>Shermer p. 183.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1860s the stage magician [[John Nevil Maskelyne]] exposed the trickery of the [[Davenport brothers]].<ref>Steinmeyer, Jim (2005).

His vehement defence of spiritualism strained his relationships with previously friendly scientists such as [[Henry Walter Bates|Henry Bates]], [[Thomas Huxley]], and even Darwin, who felt he was overly credulous. Evidence of this can be seen in Wallace's letters dated 22 November and 1 December 1866, to Thomas Huxley asking him if he would be interested in getting involved in scientific spiritualist investigations which Huxley, politely but emphatically, declined on the basis that he had neither the time nor the inclination.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/scientific-resources/collections/library-collections/wallace-letters-online/index.html|title=Wallace Letters Online|last=Wallace|first=Alfred Russel|date=16 November 2010|website=The Alfred Russel Wallace Correspondence Project|access-date=}}</ref> Others, such as the physiologist [[William Benjamin Carpenter]] and zoologist [[E. Ray Lankester]] became openly and publicly hostile to Wallace over the issue. Wallace and other scientists who defended spiritualism, notably William Crookes, were subject to much criticism from the press, with ''[[The Lancet]]'' as the leading English medical journal of the time being particularly harsh. The controversy affected the public perception of Wallace's work for the rest of his career.<ref>Slotten pp. 298\u2013351.</ref> When, in 1879, Darwin first tried to rally support among naturalists to get a civil pension awarded to Wallace, [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Joseph Hooker]] responded:\n\n{{quote|Wallace has lost caste considerably, not only by his adhesion to Spiritualism, but by the fact of his having deliberately and against the whole voice of the committee of his section of the British Association, brought about a discussion on Spiritualism at one of its sectional meetings&nbsp;...

Wallace, intrigued by the challenge and short of money at the time, designed an experiment in which he set up two objects along a six-mile (10&nbsp;km) stretch of canal. Both objects were at the same height above the water, and he mounted a telescope on a bridge at the same height above the water as well. When seen through the telescope, one object appeared higher than the other, showing the curvature of the earth.\n\nThe judge for the wager, the editor of ''Field'' magazine, declared Wallace the winner, but Hampden refused to accept the result. He sued Wallace and launched a campaign, which persisted for several years, of writing letters to various publications and to organisations of which Wallace was a member denouncing him as a swindler and a thief. Wallace won multiple libel suits against Hampden, but the resulting litigation cost Wallace more than the amount of the wager, and the controversy frustrated him for years.<ref>Shermer pp. 258\u201361.</ref>\n\n===Anti-vaccination campaign===\nIn the early 1880s, Wallace was drawn into the debate over mandatory smallpox [[vaccination]]. Wallace originally saw the issue as a matter of personal liberty; but, after studying some of the statistics provided by anti-vaccination activists, he began to question the efficacy of vaccination. At the time, the [[germ theory of disease]] was very new and far from universally accepted. Moreover, no one knew enough about the human [[immune system]] to understand why vaccination worked. When Wallace did some research, he discovered instances where supporters of vaccination had used questionable, in a few cases completely phony, statistics to support their arguments. Always suspicious of authority, Wallace suspected that physicians had a vested interest in promoting vaccination, and became convinced that reductions in the incidence of smallpox that had been attributed to vaccination were, in fact, due to better hygiene and improvements in public sanitation.<ref name=\"Slotten422-436\">Slotten pp. 422\u201336.</ref>\n\nAnother factor in Wallace's thinking was his belief that, because of the action of natural selection, organisms were in a state of balance with their environment, and that everything in nature, even disease-causing organisms, served a useful purpose in the natural order of things; he feared vaccination might upset that natural balance with unfortunate results.<ref name=\"Shermer215\"/> Wallace and other anti-vaccinationists pointed out that vaccination, which at the time was often done in a sloppy and unsanitary manner, could be dangerous.<ref name=\"Shermer215\">Shermer pp. 215\u201316.</ref>\n\nIn 1890, Wallace gave evidence before a [[Royal Commission]] investigating the controversy. When the commission examined the material he had submitted to support his testimony, they found errors, including some questionable statistics. ''[[The Lancet]]'' averred that Wallace and the other anti-vaccination activists were being selective in their choice of statistics, ignoring large quantities of data inconsistent with their position. The commission found that smallpox vaccination was effective and should remain compulsory, though they did recommend some changes in procedures to improve safety, and that the penalties for people who refused to comply be made less severe. Years later, in 1898, Wallace wrote a pamphlet, ''Vaccination a Delusion; Its Penal Enforcement a Crime'', attacking the commission's findings. It, in turn, was attacked by ''The Lancet'', which stated that it contained many of the same errors as his evidence given to the commission.<ref name=\"Slotten422-436\"/>\n\n==Legacy and historical perception==\n[[File:Alfred Russel Wallace - Project Gutenberg eText 14558.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Wallace and his signature on the frontispiece of ''Darwinism'' (1889)]]\n\nAs a result of his writing, at the time of his death Wallace had been for many years a well-known figure both as a scientist and as a social activist. He was often sought out by journalists and others for his views on a variety of topics.<ref>Shermer pp. 292\u201394.</ref> He received honorary doctorates and a number of professional honours, such the [[Royal Society]]'s [[Royal Medal]] and [[Darwin Medal]] in 1868 and 1890 respectively,<ref name=eb1911>{{Cite EB1911 | wstitle=Wallace, Alfred Russel}}</ref> and the [[Order of Merit]] in 1908.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=28194 |supp=y|page=8162|date=9 November 1908}}</ref> Above all, his role as the co-discoverer of natural selection and his work on zoogeography marked him out as an exceptional figure.\n\nHe was undoubtedly one of the greatest natural history explorers of the 19th century. Despite this, his fame faded quickly after his death. For a long time, he was treated as a relatively obscure figure in the history of science.<ref name = \"Slotten_p6\"/> A number of reasons have been suggested for this lack of attention, including his modesty, his willingness to champion unpopular causes without regard for his own reputation, and the discomfort of much of the scientific community with some of his unconventional ideas.\n\nRecently, he has become a less obscure figure with the publication of several book-length biographies on him, as well as anthologies of his writings. In 2007 a literary critic for ''New Yorker'' magazine observed that five such biographies and two such anthologies had been published since 2000.<ref>{{cite web |last=Rosen |first=Jonathan |title=Missing Link: Alfred Russel Wallace, Charles Darwin's neglected double |url=https://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2007/02/12/070212crat_atlarge_rosen |publisher=The New Yorker Feb 2007|accessdate=25 April 2007}}</ref> There has also been a web page created that is dedicated to Wallace scholarship.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page |url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/index1.htm |publisher=hosted by Western Kentucky University |accessdate=13 May 2007 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070523065328/http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/index1.htm| archivedate= 23 May 2007 |url-status = live}}</ref>\nIn a 2010 book, the environmentalist [[Tim Flannery]] claimed that Wallace was 'the first modern scientist to comprehend how essential cooperation is to our survival,'<ref>Flannery, p. 32.</ref> and suggested that Wallace's understanding of natural selection and his later work on the atmosphere be seen as a forerunner to modern ecological thinking.\n[[File:Bronze statue of Alfred Russel Wallace.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Anthony Smith (sculptor)|Anthony Smith's]] statue of Wallace, looking up at a bronze model of a [[Ornithoptera croesus|Wallace's golden birdwing butterfly]].

He further broke down the 747 short pieces by their primary subjects as follows. 29% were on biogeography and natural history, 27% were on evolutionary theory, 25% were social commentary, 12% were on Anthropology, and 7% were on spiritualism and phrenology.<ref>Shermer pp. 15\u201317.</ref> An online bibliography of Wallace's writings has more than 750 entries.<ref name=\"Bibliography\"/>\n\n===Selected books===\n* {{cite book\n|title=Palm trees of the Amazon and their uses.\n|last=Wallace\n|first=Alfred Russel\n|year=1853\n|publisher=London\n|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/42833\n|format=Biodiversity Heritage Library\n}}\n* {{cite book\n|last=Wallace\n|first=Alfred Russel\n|year=1869\n|title=The Malay Archipelago\n|publisher=Harper\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EldIBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Rajendra+Chola+zulkarnain\n|isbn=9781776580736\n}}\n* {{cite book\n|last=Wallace\n|first=Alfred Russel\n|title=Contributions to the Theory of Natural Selection\n|url=https://archive.org/details/contributionsto03wallgoog\n|format=Google Books\n|edition=2nd\n|year=1870\n|publisher=Macmillan and Company\n}}\n* {{cite book\n|last=Wallace\n|first=Alfred Russel\n|title=The Geographical Distribution of Animals\n|url=https://archive.org/details/geographicaldis01wallgoog\n|format=Google Books\n|year=1876\n|publisher=Harper and brothers\n}}\n* {{cite book\n|title=Tropical Nature, and Other Essays\n|last=Wallace |first=Alfred Russel\n|year=1878\n|publisher=Macmillan\n|url=https://archive.org/details/tropicalnaturea00wallgoog\n|format=Google Books\n}}\n* {{cite book\n|last=Wallace\n|first=Alfred Russel\n|title=Island Life\n|url=https://archive.org/details/islandlifeorphe02wallgoog\n|year=1881\n|publisher=Harper and brothers\n}}\n* {{cite book\n|last=Wallace\n|first=Alfred Russel\n|title=Darwinism: An Exposition of the Theory of Natural Selection, with Some of Its Applications\n|url=https://archive.org/details/darwinismanexpo04wallgoog\n|year=1889\n|publisher=Macmillan }}\n* {{cite book|last=Wallace|first=Alfred Russel|title=Travels on the Amazon and Rio Negro|url=https://archive.org/details/narrativeoftrave00wall|format=Internet Archive|edition=1889|location=|pages=|year=1889|isbn=|publisher=Ward, Lock}}\n* {{cite book\n|title=Man's Place in the Universe\n|last=Wallace\n|first=Alfred Russel\n|year=1903\n|publisher=Chapman & Hall\n|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39928\n|format=Gutenberg\n}}\n* {{cite book\n|title=My Life\n|last=Wallace\n|first=Alfred Russel\n|year=1905\n|publisher=Chapman & Hall\n|url=https://archive.org/details/b31360580_0002\n|format=Google Books\n}}\n\n===Selected papers===\n* 1853: On the Monkeys of the Amazon.

These included the concept of [[Aposematism|warning colouration]] in animals, and the [[Wallace effect]], a hypothesis on how natural selection could contribute to [[speciation]] by encouraging the development of barriers against [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridisation]]. Wallace's 1904 book ''Man's Place in the Universe'' was the first serious attempt by a biologist to evaluate the [[Planetary habitability|likelihood of life on other planets]]. He was also one of the first scientists to write a serious exploration of the subject of whether there was life on Mars.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S730.htm|title=Is Mars Habitable?, by Alfred Russel Wallace|website=people.wku.edu|access-date=2017-10-15}}</ref>\n\nWallace was strongly attracted to unconventional ideas (such as evolution). His advocacy of [[spiritualism]] and his belief in a [[Mind\u2013body dualism|non-material origin]] for the higher mental faculties of humans strained his relationship with some members of the scientific establishment.\n\nAside from scientific work, he was a social activist who was critical of what he considered to be an unjust social and economic system (capitalism) in 19th-century Britain. His interest in natural history resulted in his being one of the first prominent scientists to raise concerns over the environmental impact of human activity. He was also a prolific author who wrote on both scientific and social issues; his account of his adventures and observations during his explorations in Singapore, [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]], ''[[The Malay Archipelago]]'', was both popular and highly regarded. Since its publication in 1869, it has never been out of print.\n\nWallace had financial difficulties throughout much of his life. His Amazon and Far Eastern trips were supported by the sale of specimens he collected and, after he lost most of the considerable money he made from those sales in unsuccessful investments, he had to support himself mostly from the publications he produced. Unlike some of his contemporaries in the British scientific community, such as Darwin and [[Charles Lyell]], he had no family wealth to fall back on, and he was unsuccessful in finding a long-term salaried position, receiving no regular income until he was awarded a small government pension, through Darwin's efforts, in 1881.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nAlfred Wallace was born in the Welsh village of [[Llanbadoc]], near [[Usk]], [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]].<ref>Wilson ''The Forgotten Naturalist'' p. 1.</ref> He was the eighth of nine children of Thomas Vere Wallace and Mary Anne Greenell. Mary Anne was English; Thomas Wallace was probably of Scottish ancestry. His family, like many Wallaces, claimed a connection to [[William Wallace]], a leader of Scottish forces during the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]] in the 13th century.<ref name=WKU_bio/> Thomas Wallace graduated in law but never practised law. He owned some income-generating property, but bad investments and failed business ventures resulted in a steady deterioration of the family's financial position.

This was a stopgap measure until William, his oldest brother, was ready to take him on as an apprentice [[surveying|surveyor]]. While in London, Alfred attended lectures and read books at the [[London Mechanics Institute]] (current [[Birkbeck, University of London]]) . Here he was exposed to the radical political ideas of the Welsh social reformer [[Robert Owen]] and of [[Thomas Paine]]. He left London in 1837 to live with William and work as his apprentice for six years.\n\nAt the end of 1839, they moved to [[Kington, Herefordshire|Kington]], Hereford, near the Welsh border, before eventually settling at [[Neath]] in [[Glamorgan]] in Wales. Between 1840 and 1843, Wallace did land surveying work in the countryside of the west of England and Wales.<ref>Raby ''Bright Paradise'' pp. 77\u201378.</ref><ref>Ross A. Slotten. ''The Heretic in Darwin's Court:The Life of Alfred Russel Wallace''.Columbia University Press, June 2004.pp. 11\u201314.</ref> By the end of 1843, William's business had declined due to difficult economic conditions, and Wallace, at the age of 20, left in January.\n\nOne result of Wallace's early travels is a modern controversy about his nationality. Since Wallace was born in [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]], some sources have considered him to be Welsh.<ref>{{cite web|title=28.

One Wallace scholar has stated that the most reasonable interpretation is therefore that he was an Englishman born in Wales.<ref name=\"Smith\"/>\n\nAfter a brief period of unemployment, he was hired as a master at the Collegiate School in [[Leicester]] to teach drawing, mapmaking, and surveying. Wallace spent many hours at the library in Leicester: he read ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' by [[Thomas Robert Malthus]], and one evening he met the entomologist [[Henry Walter Bates|Henry Bates]]. Bates was 19 years old, and in 1843 he had published a paper on beetles in the journal ''Zoologist''. He befriended Wallace and started him collecting insects.<ref>Shermer ''In Darwin's Shadow'' p. 53.</ref><ref>Slotten pp. 22\u201326.</ref> William died in March 1845, and Wallace left his teaching position to assume control of his brother's firm in Neath, but his brother John and he were unable to make the business work. After a few months, Wallace found work as a civil engineer for a nearby firm that was working on a survey for a proposed railway in the [[River Neath|Vale of Neath]].\n\nWallace's work on the survey involved spending a lot of time outdoors in the countryside, allowing him to indulge his new passion for collecting insects. Wallace persuaded his brother John to join him in starting another architecture and civil engineering firm, which carried out a number of projects, including the design of a building for the Neath [[Mechanics' Institute]], founded in 1843.<ref>[http://www.tlysau.org.uk/cgi-bin/anw/search2?coll_id=11281&inst_id=35&term=Neath \"Neath Mechanics' Institute\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110014026/http://www.tlysau.org.uk/cgi-bin/anw/search2?coll_id=11281&inst_id=35&term=Neath |date=10 November 2013 }} [[Swansea University]]. Retrieved 21 April 2013.</ref> William Jevons, the founder of that institute, was impressed by Wallace and persuaded him to give lectures there on science and engineering. In the autumn of 1846, John and he purchased a cottage near Neath, where they lived with their mother and sister Fanny (his father had died in 1843).<ref>Slotten pp. 26\u201329.</ref><ref>Wilson pp. 19\u201320.</ref>\n\nDuring this period, he read avidly, exchanging letters with Bates about [[Robert Chambers (publisher, born 1802)|Robert Chambers]]' anonymously published evolutionary treatise ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]'', Charles Darwin's ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle]]'', and [[Charles Lyell]]'s ''[[Principles of Geology]]''.<ref>Raby p. 78.</ref><ref>Wallace ''My Life'' pp. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&itemID=A237.1&pageseq=287 254], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&itemID=A237.1&pageseq=289 256]</ref>\n\n===Exploration and study of the natural world===\n[[File:Wallace map archipelago.jpg|thumb|300px|A map from ''[[The Malay Archipelago]]'' shows the physical geography of the archipelago and Wallace's travels around the area. The thin black lines indicate where Wallace travelled, and the red lines indicate chains of volcanoes.]]\n\nInspired by the chronicles of earlier and contemporary travelling naturalists, including [[Alexander von Humboldt]], [[Ida Laura Pfeiffer]], Charles Darwin and especially [[William Henry Edwards]], Wallace decided that he too wanted to travel abroad as a naturalist.<ref>Slotten pp. 34\u201337.</ref> In 1848, Wallace and Henry Bates left for Brazil aboard the ''Mischief''. Their intention was to collect insects and other animal specimens in the [[Amazon Rainforest]] for their private collections, selling the duplicates to museums and collectors back in Britain in order to fund the trip. Wallace also hoped to gather evidence of the [[transmutation of species]].\n\nWallace and Bates spent most of their first year collecting near [[Bel\u00e9m]], then explored inland separately, occasionally meeting to discuss their findings. In 1849, they were briefly joined by another young explorer, botanist [[Richard Spruce]], along with Wallace's younger brother Herbert. Herbert left soon thereafter (dying two years later from [[yellow fever]]), but Spruce, like Bates, would spend over ten years collecting in South America.<ref>Wilson p. 36; Raby pp. 89, 98\u201399, 120\u201321.</ref>\n\nWallace continued charting the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] for four years, collecting specimens and making notes on the peoples and languages he encountered as well as the geography, flora, and fauna.<ref>Raby pp. 89\u201395.</ref> On 12 July 1852, Wallace embarked for the UK on the brig ''Helen''. After 26 days at sea, the ship's cargo caught fire and the crew was forced to abandon ship. All of the specimens Wallace had on the ship, mostly collected during the last, and most interesting, two years of his trip, were lost. He managed to save a few notes and pencil sketches and little else.\n\nWallace and the crew spent ten days in an open boat before being picked up by the brig ''Jordeson'', which was sailing from Cuba to London. The ''Jordeson'''s provisions were strained by the unexpected passengers, but after a difficult passage on very short rations the ship finally reached its destination on 1 October 1852.<ref>Shermer pp. 72\u201373.</ref><ref name=\"Slotten87-88\">Slotten pp. 84\u201388</ref>\n\nAfter his return to the UK, Wallace spent 18 months in London living on the insurance payment for his lost collection and selling a few specimens that had been shipped back to Britain prior to his starting his exploration of the [[R\u00edo Negro (Argentina)|Rio Negro]] until the Indian town of [[Jativa]] on [[Orinoco River]] basin and as far west as Mic\u00faru ([[Mit\u00fa]]) on the [[Uaup\u00e9s River]]. He was deeply impressed by the grandeur of the virgin forest, by the variety and beauty of the butterflies and birds, and by his first encounter with Indians on the Uaup\u00e9s River area, an experience he never forgot. During this period, despite having lost almost all of the notes from his South American expedition, he wrote six academic papers (which included \"On the Monkeys of the Amazon\") and two books; ''Palm Trees of the Amazon and Their Uses'' and ''Travels on the Amazon''.<ref>Wilson p. 45.</ref> He also made connections with a number of other British naturalists.<ref name=\"Slotten87-88\"/><ref>Raby, Bright Paradise p. 148.</ref><ref name=\"Bibliography\"/>\n\n[[File:Wallace frog.jpg|thumb|left|An illustration from ''The Malay Archipelago'' depicts the [[flying frog]] Wallace discovered.]]\n\nFrom 1854 to 1862, age 31 to 39, Wallace travelled through the Malay Archipelago or [[East Indies]] (now Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia), to collect specimens for sale and to study natural history. A set of 80 bird skeletons he collected in Indonesia and associated documentation can be found in the [[Cambridge University Museum of Zoology]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.zoo.cam.ac.uk/collections.archives/historical.significance/ |title=University Museum of Zoology, Cambridge &#124; Historical significance |publisher=Museum.zoo.cam.ac.uk |date=18 April 2009 |accessdate=13 March 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119040924/https://www.museum.zoo.cam.ac.uk/collections.archives/historical.significance|archivedate=19 November 2010}}</ref> Wallace had as many as a hundred assistants who collected on his behalf. Among these, his most trusted assistant was a Malay by the name of Ali who later called himself [[Ali Wallace (naturalist)|Ali Wallace]]. While Wallace collected insects, many of the bird specimens were collected by his assistants including around 5000 collected and prepared by Ali.<ref name=ali>{{cite journal|doi=10.1353/ras.2015.0012|title='I am Ali Wallace': The Malay Assistant of Alfred Russel Wallace|journal=Journal of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society|volume=88|pages=3\u201331|year=2015|last1=Wyhe|first1=John Van|last2=Drawhorn|first2=Gerrell M.}}</ref> Wallace's observations of the marked zoological differences across a narrow strait in the archipelago led to his proposing the zoogeographical boundary now known as the [[Wallace line]].\n\nWallace collected more than 126,000 specimens in the Malay Archipelago (more than 80,000 beetles alone). Several thousand of them represented species new to science.<ref>Shermer p. 14.</ref> One of his better-known species descriptions during this trip is that of the gliding tree frog ''[[Rhacophorus nigropalmatus]]'', known as Wallace's [[flying frog]]. While he was exploring the archipelago, he refined his thoughts about evolution and had his famous insight on [[natural selection]]. In 1858 he sent an article outlining his theory to Darwin; it was published, along with a description of Darwin's own theory, in the same year.\n\nAccounts of his studies and adventures there were eventually published in 1869 as ''[[The Malay Archipelago]]'', which became one of the most popular books of scientific exploration of the 19th century, and has never been out of print. It was praised by scientists such as Darwin (to whom the book was dedicated), and Charles Lyell, and by non-scientists such as the novelist [[Joseph Conrad]], who called it his \"favorite bedside companion\" and used it as source of information for several of his novels, especially ''[[Lord Jim]]''.<ref>Slotten p. 267.</ref>\n\n===Return to England, marriage and children===\n[[File:Alfred Russel Wallace 1862 - Project Gutenberg eText 15997.png|thumb|upright|A photograph of A.R. Wallace taken in Singapore in 1862]]\n\nIn 1862, Wallace returned to England, where he moved in with his sister Fanny Sims and her husband Thomas. While recovering from his travels, Wallace organised his collections and gave numerous lectures about his adventures and discoveries to scientific societies such as the [[Zoological Society of London]]. Later that year, he visited Darwin at [[Down House]], and became friendly with both Charles Lyell and [[Herbert Spencer]].<ref>Shermer pp. 151\u201352.</ref> During the 1860s, Wallace wrote papers and gave lectures defending natural selection. He also corresponded with Darwin about a variety of topics, including [[sexual selection]], [[warning colouration]], and the possible effect of natural selection on hybridisation and the divergence of species.<ref>Slotten pp. 249\u201358.</ref> In 1865, he began investigating spiritualism.<ref>Slotten p. 235.</ref>\n\nAfter a year of courtship, Wallace became engaged in 1864 to a young woman whom, in his autobiography, he would only identify as Miss L. Miss L. was the daughter of Lewis Leslie who played chess with Wallace.<ref>van Whye, John Dispelling the Darkness, World Scientific, 2013, p. 310.</ref> However, to Wallace's great dismay, she broke off the engagement.<ref>Shermer p. 156.</ref> In 1866, Wallace married Annie Mitten. Wallace had been introduced to Mitten through the botanist Richard Spruce, who had befriended Wallace in Brazil and who was also a good friend of Annie Mitten's father, [[William Mitten]], an expert on mosses. In 1872, Wallace built [[The Dell (Thurrock)|the Dell]], a house of concrete, on land he leased in [[Grays]] in Essex, where he lived until 1876. The Wallaces had three children: Herbert (1867\u20131874), Violet (1869\u20131945), and William (1871\u20131951).<ref>Slotten pp. 239\u201340.</ref>\n\n===Financial struggles===\nIn the late 1860s and 1870s, Wallace was very concerned about the financial security of his family. While he was in the Malay Archipelago, the sale of specimens had brought in a considerable amount of money, which had been carefully invested by the agent who sold the specimens for Wallace. However, on his return to the UK, Wallace made a series of bad investments in railways and mines that squandered most of the money, and he found himself badly in need of the proceeds from the publication of ''[[The Malay Archipelago]]''.<ref>Slotten pp. 265\u201367.</ref>\n\nDespite assistance from his friends, he was never able to secure a permanent salaried position such as a curatorship in a museum. To remain financially solvent, Wallace worked grading government examinations, wrote 25 papers for publication between 1872 and 1876 for various modest sums, and was paid by Lyell and Darwin to help edit some of their own works.<ref>Slotten pp. 299\u2013300.</ref>\n\nIn 1876, Wallace needed a \u00a3500 advance from the publisher of ''The Geographical Distribution of Animals'' to avoid having to sell some of his personal property.<ref>Slotten p. 325.</ref> Darwin was very aware of Wallace's financial difficulties and lobbied long and hard to get Wallace awarded a government pension for his lifetime contributions to science. When the [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]200 annual pension was awarded in 1881, it helped to stabilise Wallace's financial position by supplementing the income from his writings.<ref>Slotten pp. 361\u201364.</ref>\n\n===Social activism===\n[[John Stuart Mill]] was impressed by remarks criticising English society that Wallace had included in ''The Malay Archipelago''. Mill asked him to join the general committee of his [[Land Tenure Reform Association]], but the association dissolved after Mill's death in 1873. Wallace had written only a handful of articles on political and social issues between 1873 and 1879 when, at the age of 56, he entered the debates over trade policy and [[land reform]] in earnest. He believed that rural land should be owned by the state and leased to people who would make whatever use of it that would benefit the largest number of people, thus breaking the often-abused power of wealthy landowners in British society.\n\nIn 1881, Wallace was elected as the first president of the newly formed Land Nationalisation Society. In the next year, he published a book, ''Land Nationalisation; Its Necessity and Its Aims'', on the subject. He criticised the UK's [[free trade]] policies for the negative impact they had on working-class people.<ref name=\"Bibliography\">{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred|title=Bibliography of the Writings of Alfred Russel Wallace|url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/index1.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=6 May 2007}}</ref><ref>Slotten pp. 365\u201372.</ref> In 1889, Wallace read ''[[Looking Backward]]'' by [[Edward Bellamy]] and declared himself a socialist, despite his earlier foray as a speculative investor.<ref>Slotten p. 436.</ref> After reading ''[[Progress and Poverty]]'', the best selling book by the progressive land reformist [[Henry George]], Wallace described it as \"Undoubtedly the most remarkable and important book of the present century.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Stanley|first=Buder|title=Visionaries and Planners: The Garden City Movement and the Modern Community|year=1990|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=evBdKUyXY7UC|isbn=9780195362886}}</ref>\n\nWallace opposed [[eugenics]], an idea supported by other prominent 19th-century evolutionary thinkers, on the grounds that contemporary society was too corrupt and unjust to allow any reasonable determination of who was fit or unfit.<ref>Slotten pp. 436\u201338.</ref> In the 1890 article \"Human Selection\" he wrote, \"Those who succeed in the race for wealth are by no means the best or the most intelligent&nbsp;...\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred|title=Human Selection (S427: 1890)|url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S427.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=27 May 2012}}</ref> In 1898, Wallace wrote a paper advocating a [[Fiat money|pure paper money system, not backed by silver or gold]], which impressed the economist [[Irving Fisher]] so much that he dedicated his 1920 book ''Stabilizing the Dollar'' to Wallace.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred|title=Paper Money as a Standard of Value (S557: 1898)|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/S557.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=6 May 2007}}</ref>\n\nWallace wrote on other social and political topics including his support for [[women's suffrage]], and repeatedly on the dangers and wastefulness of [[militarism]].<ref>Slotten pp. 366, 453, 487\u201388.</ref><ref>Shermer pp. 23, 279.</ref> In an essay published in 1899 Wallace called for popular opinion to be rallied against warfare by showing people: \"...that all modern wars are dynastic; that they are caused by the ambition, the interests, the jealousies, and the insatiable greed of power of their rulers, or of the great mercantile and financial classes which have power and influence over their rulers; and that the results of war are never good for the people, who yet bear all its burthens\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred|title=The Causes of War, and the Remedies (S567: 1899)|url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S567.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=22 November 2015}}</ref> In a letter published by the [[Daily Mail]] in 1909, with aviation in its infancy, he advocated an international treaty to ban the military use of aircraft, arguing against the idea \"...that this new horror is \"inevitable,\" and that all we can do is to be sure and be in the front rank of the aerial assassins\u2014for surely no other term can so fitly describe the dropping of, say, ten thousand bombs at midnight into an enemy's capital from an invisible flight of airships.\"<ref>{{cite web | last=Wallace | first=Alfred| title=Flying Machines in War.

The first part of the book covered the major scientific and technical advances of the century; the second part covered what Wallace considered to be its social failures including: the destruction and waste of wars and arms races, the rise of the urban poor and the dangerous conditions in which they lived and worked, a harsh criminal justice system that failed to reform criminals, abuses in a mental health system based on privately owned sanatoriums, the environmental damage caused by capitalism, and the evils of European colonialism.<ref>Slotten pp. 453\u201355.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Wallace|first=Alfred|title=''The Wonderful Century: Its successes and failures|url=https://archive.org/details/wonderfulcentur03wallgoog|accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref> Wallace continued his social activism for the rest of his life, publishing the book ''The Revolt of Democracy'' just weeks before his death.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred|title=The Revolt of Democracy (S734: 1913)|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/S734.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=6 May 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Further scientific work===\nWallace continued his scientific work in parallel with his social commentary. In 1880, he published ''Island Life'' as a sequel to ''The Geographic Distribution of Animals''. In November 1886, Wallace began a ten-month trip to the United States to give a series of popular lectures. Most of the lectures were on Darwinism (evolution through natural selection), but he also gave speeches on [[biogeography]], spiritualism, and socio-economic reform. During the trip, he was reunited with his brother John who had emigrated to California years before. He also spent a week in Colorado, with the American botanist [[Alice Eastwood]] as his guide, exploring the flora of the [[Rocky Mountains]] and gathering evidence that would lead him to a theory on how [[glaciation]] might explain certain commonalities between the mountain flora of Europe, Asia and North America, which he published in 1891 in the paper \"English and American Flowers\". He met many other prominent American naturalists and viewed their collections. His 1889 book ''[[Darwinism (book)|Darwinism]]'' used information he collected on his American trip and information he had compiled for the lectures.<ref>Shermer pp. 274\u201378.</ref><ref>Slotten pp. 379\u2013400.</ref>\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Restored grave of AR Wallace.jpg|thumb|upright|Wallace's grave in Broadstone Cemetery, [[Broadstone, Dorset]], which was restored by the A.

It features a {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=on}} tall [[Petrified wood|fossil tree trunk]] from Portland mounted on a block of [[Purbeck limestone]].]]\n\nOn 7 November 1913, Wallace died at home in the country house he called Old Orchard, which he had built a decade earlier.<ref name=\"Slotten490\">Slotten p. 490.</ref> He was 90 years old. His death was widely reported in the press. ''[[The New York Times]]'' called him \"the last of the giants belonging to that wonderful group of intellectuals that included, among others, Darwin, Huxley, Spencer, Lyell, and Owen, whose daring investigations revolutionised and evolutionised the thought of the century.\" Another commentator in the same edition said: \"No apology need be made for the few literary or scientific follies of the author of that great book on the 'Malay Archipelago'.\"<ref>Slotten p. 491.</ref>\n\nSome of Wallace's friends suggested that he be buried in [[Westminster Abbey]], but his wife followed his wishes and had him buried in the small cemetery at [[Broadstone, Dorset]].<ref name=\"Slotten490\"/> Several prominent British scientists formed a committee to have a medallion of Wallace placed in Westminster Abbey near where Darwin had been buried. The medallion was unveiled on 1 November 1915.\n\n==Theory of evolution==\n\n===Early evolutionary thinking===\nUnlike Darwin, Wallace began his career as a travelling naturalist already believing in the [[transmutation of species]]. The concept had been advocated by [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]], [[\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire|Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]], [[Erasmus Darwin]], and [[Robert Edmond Grant|Robert Grant]], among others. It was widely discussed, but not generally accepted by leading naturalists, and was considered to have [[radicalism (historical)|radical]], even revolutionary connotations.<ref name=\"Larson73\">Larson Evolution p. 73.</ref><ref>Peter J. Bowler, Iwan Rhys Morus. ''Making Modern Science: A Historical Survey''. University of Chicago Press, 2005, p. 141</ref>\n\nProminent anatomists and geologists such as [[Georges Cuvier]], [[Richard Owen]], [[Adam Sedgwick]], and [[Charles Lyell]] attacked it vigorously.<ref>McGowan The Dragon Seekers pp. 101, 154\u201355.</ref><ref>Larson pp. 23\u201324, 37\u201338.</ref> It has been suggested that Wallace accepted the idea of the transmutation of species in part because he was always inclined to favour radical ideas in politics, religion and science,<ref name=\"Larson73\"/> and because he was unusually open to marginal, even fringe, ideas in science.<ref name=\"Shermer p. 54\">Shermer p. 54.</ref>\n\nHe was also profoundly influenced by [[Robert Chambers (journalist)|Robert Chambers]]' work, ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]'', a highly controversial work of popular science published anonymously in 1844 that advocated an evolutionary origin for the solar system, the earth, and living things.<ref>Slotten p. 31.</ref> Wallace wrote to Henry Bates in 1845:\n\n{{quote|I have a rather more favourable opinion of the 'Vestiges' than you appear to have. I do not consider it a hasty generalization, but rather as an ingenious hypothesis strongly supported by some striking facts and analogies, but which remains to be proven by more facts and the additional light which more research may throw upon the problem. It furnishes a subject for every student of nature to attend to; every fact he observes will make either for or against it, and it thus serves both as an incitement to the collection of facts, and an object to which they can be applied when collected.<ref name=\"Shermer p. 54\"/>}}\n\nIn 1847, he wrote to Bates:\n{{quote|I should like to take some one family [of beetles] to study thoroughly, principally with a view to the theory of the origin of species. By that means I am strongly of opinion that some definite results might be arrived at.<ref>\nWallace Family Archive, 11 Oct. 1847, quoted in {{harvnb|Raby|2002|p=1}}.\n</ref>}}\n\nWallace deliberately planned some of his fieldwork to test the hypothesis that under an evolutionary scenario closely related species should inhabit neighbouring territories.<ref name=\"Larson73\"/> During his work in the Amazon basin, he came to realise that geographical barriers\u2014such as the Amazon and its major tributaries\u2014often separated the ranges of closely allied species, and he included these observations in his 1853 paper \"On the Monkeys of the Amazon\".<ref>Slotten p. 94.</ref> Near the end of the paper he asks the question, \"Are very closely allied species ever separated by a wide interval of country?\"\n\nIn February 1855, while working in [[Sarawak]] on the island of [[Borneo]], Wallace wrote \"On the Law which has Regulated the Introduction of New Species\", a paper which was published in the ''[[Journal of Natural History|Annals and Magazine of Natural History]]'' in September 1855.<ref>{{cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = Wallace Collection \u2013 Wallace's 'Sarawak law' paper | url = http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/collections-at-the-museum/wallace-collection/closeup.jsp?itemID=138&theme=Evolution | publisher = [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] | year = 2012 | accessdate = 14 February 2012 }}</ref> In this paper, he discussed observations regarding the geographic and geologic distribution of both living and fossil species, what would become known as [[biogeography]]. His conclusion that \"Every species has come into existence coincident both in space and time with a closely allied species\" has come to be known as the \"Sarawak Law\". Wallace thus answered the question he had posed in his earlier paper on the monkeys of the Amazon river basin. Although it contained no mention of any possible mechanisms for evolution, this paper foreshadowed the momentous paper he would write three years later.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred Russel|title=On the Law Which has Regulated the Introduction of Species|url=http://www.wku.edu/%7Esmithch/wallace/S020.htm|year=1855|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=8 May 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070428194531/http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/S020.htm| archivedate= 28 April 2007 |url-status = live}}</ref>\n\nThe paper shook Charles Lyell's belief that species were immutable. Although his friend Charles Darwin had written to him in 1842 expressing support for transmutation, Lyell had continued to be strongly opposed to the idea. Around the start of 1856, he told Darwin about Wallace's paper, as did [[Edward Blyth]] who thought it \"Good! Upon the whole!&nbsp;... Wallace has, I think put the matter well; and according to his theory the various domestic races of animals have been fairly developed into ''species''.\" Despite this hint, Darwin mistook Wallace's conclusion for the [[progressive creationism]] of the time and wrote that it was \"nothing very new&nbsp;... Uses my simile of tree [but] it seems all creation with him.\" Lyell was more impressed and opened a notebook on species, in which he grappled with the consequences, particularly for human ancestry. Darwin had already shown his theory to their mutual friend [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Joseph Hooker]] and now, for the first time, he spelt out the full details of [[natural selection]] to Lyell. Although Lyell could not agree, he urged Darwin to publish to establish priority. Darwin demurred at first, then began writing up a ''species sketch'' of his continuing work in May 1856.<ref>Desmond & Moore ''Darwin'' 1991, p. 438;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Browne ''Charles Darwin: Voyaging'' pp. 537\u201346.</ref>\n\n===Natural selection and Darwin===\n{{see also|Publication of Darwin's theory}}\n\nBy February 1858, Wallace had been convinced by his biogeographical research in the Malay Archipelago that evolution was real.

Although Wallace's first letter to Darwin has been lost, Wallace carefully kept the letters he received.<ref>Marchant, 1916.

Darwin received the essay on 18 June 1858. Although the essay did not use Darwin's term \"natural selection\", it did outline the mechanics of an evolutionary divergence of species from similar ones due to environmental pressures. In this sense, it was very similar to the theory that Darwin had worked on for 20 years, but had yet to publish. Darwin sent the manuscript to Charles Lyell with a letter saying \"he could not have made a better short abstract! Even his terms now stand as heads of my chapters&nbsp;... he does not say he wishes me to publish, but I shall, of course, at once write and offer to send to any journal.\"<ref>Slotten pp. 153\u201354<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Darwin, Francis, 1887, ''The life and letters of Charles Darwin'' [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1452.2&viewtype=text&pageseq=132 p. 116]</ref> Distraught about the illness of his baby son, Darwin put the problem to Charles Lyell and [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Joseph Hooker]], who decided to publish the essay in a joint presentation together with unpublished writings which highlighted Darwin's priority. Wallace's essay was presented to the [[Linnean Society of London]] on 1 July 1858, along with excerpts from an essay which Darwin had disclosed privately to Hooker in 1847 and a letter Darwin had written to [[Asa Gray]] in 1857.<ref>Browne ''Charles Darwin: The Power of Place'' pp. 33\u201342.</ref>\n\nCommunication with Wallace in the far-off Malay Archipelago involved months of delay, so he was not part of this rapid publication. Wallace accepted the arrangement after the fact, happy that he had been included at all, and never expressed bitterness in public or in private. Darwin's social and scientific status was far greater than Wallace's, and it was unlikely that, without Darwin, Wallace's views on evolution would have been taken seriously. Lyell and Hooker's arrangement relegated Wallace to the position of co-discoverer, and he was not the social equal of Darwin or the other prominent British natural scientists. However, the joint reading of their papers on natural selection associated Wallace with the more famous Darwin. This, combined with Darwin's (as well as Hooker's and Lyell's) advocacy on his behalf, would give Wallace greater access to the highest levels of the scientific community.<ref>Shermer pp. 148\u201350.</ref> The reaction to the reading was muted, with the president of the Linnean Society remarking in May 1859 that the year had not been marked by any striking discoveries;<ref>Browne ''Charles Darwin: The Power of Place'' pp. 40\u201342.</ref> but, with Darwin's publication of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' later in 1859, its significance became apparent. When Wallace returned to the UK, he met Darwin. Although some of Wallace's iconoclastic opinions in the ensuing years would test Darwin's patience, they remained on friendly terms for the rest of Darwin's life.\n\nOver the years, a few people have questioned this version of events. In the early 1980s, two books, one written by Arnold Brackman and another by John Langdon Brooks, even suggested not only that there had been a conspiracy to rob Wallace of his proper credit, but that Darwin had actually stolen a key idea from Wallace to finish his own theory. These claims have been examined in detail by a number of scholars who have not found them convincing.<ref>Slotten pp. 157\u201362.</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Shermer|first=Michael|title=In Darwin's Shadow: Excerpt|url=http://www.michaelshermer.com/darwins-shadow/excerpt/|publisher=michaelshermer.com|accessdate=29 April 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Charles|title=Responses to Questions Frequently Asked About Wallace: Did Darwin really steal material from Wallace to complete his theory of natural selection?|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/FAQ.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=29 April 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080509183747/http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/FAQ.htm| archivedate= 9 May 2008 |url-status = live}}</ref> Shipping schedules show that, contrary to these accusations, Wallace's letter could not have been delivered earlier than the date shown in Darwin's letter to Lyell.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wyhe |first=John Van |last2=Rookmaaker |first2=Kees |year=2012 |title=A new theory to explain the receipt of Wallace's Ternate Essay by Darwin in 1858 |url= |journal= Biological Journal of the Linnean Society|volume=105  |pages=249\u2013252 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.2011.01808.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal  | last = Ball | first = Philip | title = Shipping timetables debunk Darwin plagiarism accusations   | journal = Nature | url = http://www.nature.com/news/shipping-timetables-debunk-darwin-plagiarism-accusations-1.9613 | date = 12 December 2011 | accessdate = 26 February 2012 | doi = 10.1038/nature.2011.9613 }}</ref>\n\n====Defence of Darwin and his ideas====\nAfter Wallace returned to England in 1862, he became one of the staunchest defenders of Darwin's ''On the Origin of Species''. In one incident in 1863 that particularly pleased Darwin, Wallace published the short paper \"Remarks on the Rev. S. Haughton's Paper on the Bee's Cell, And on the Origin of Species\" to rebut a paper by a professor of geology at the University of Dublin that had sharply criticised Darwin's comments in the ''Origin'' on how hexagonal honey bee cells could have evolved through natural selection.<ref>Slotten pp. 197\u201399.</ref>\n\nAn even longer defence was a 1867 article in the ''[[Quarterly Journal of Science]]'' called \"Creation by Law\". It reviewed the book ''The Reign of Law'' by [[George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll|George Campbell]], the 8th Duke of Argyll which aimed to refute natural selection.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred|title=Creation by Law (S140: 1867)\n|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/S140.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=23 May 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070602121908/http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/S140.htm| archivedate= 2 June 2007 |url-status = live}}</ref>\n\nAfter an 1870 meeting of the [[British Science Association]], Wallace wrote to Darwin complaining that there were \"no opponents left who know anything of natural history, so that there are none of the good discussions we used to have.\"<ref>Slotten p. 261.</ref>\n\n====Differences between Darwin's and Wallace's ideas on natural selection====\nHistorians of science have noted that, while Darwin considered the ideas in Wallace's paper to be essentially the same as his own, there were differences.<ref>{{Cite journal | last=Kutschera | first1=U. | title=A comparative analysis of the Darwin\u2013Wallace papers and the development of the concept of natural selection | journal=Theory in Biosciences | date=19 December 2003 | doi=10.1007/s12064-003-0063-6 | volume=122 | issue=4 | pages=343\u201359 }}</ref> Darwin emphasised competition between individuals of the same species to survive and reproduce, whereas Wallace emphasised environmental pressures on varieties and species forcing them to become adapted to their local conditions, leading populations in different locations to diverge.<ref>Larson p. 75.</ref><ref>Bowler & Morus p. 149.</ref> Some historians, notably [[Peter J.

Darwin had come to believe that many conspicuous animal colour schemes were due to [[sexual selection]]. However, this could not apply to caterpillars. Wallace responded that he and [[Henry Walter Bates|Henry Bates]] had observed that many of the most spectacular butterflies had a peculiar odour and taste, and that he had been told by [[John Jenner Weir]] that birds would not eat a certain kind of common white moth because they found it unpalatable. \"Now, as the white moth is as conspicuous at dusk as a coloured caterpillar in the daylight\", it seemed likely that the conspicuous colours served as a warning to predators and thus could have evolved through natural selection. Darwin was impressed by the idea. At a later meeting of the Entomological Society, Wallace asked for any evidence anyone might have on the topic.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Frederick|date=1867|title=March 4,1867|journal=Transactions of the Royal Entomological Society of London|volume=15|issue=7|pages=509\u2013566|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2311.1967.tb01466.x}}</ref> In 1869, Weir published data from experiments and observations involving brightly coloured caterpillars that supported Wallace's idea.  \n\nWallace attributed less importance than Darwin to sexual selection.

In 1890, he wrote a critical review in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' of his friend [[Edward Bagnall Poulton]]'s ''[[The Colours of Animals]]'' which supported Darwin on sexual selection, attacking especially Poulton's claims on the \"aesthetic preferences of the insect world\".<ref name=\"Nature\">{{cite journal | url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S424.htm | title=The Colours of Animals | author=Wallace, Alfred Russel | journal=Nature | date=24 July 1890 | volume=S42 | issue=1082 | pages=289\u201391|doi=10.1038/042289a0 | bibcode=1890Natur..42..289W }}</ref>\n\n====Wallace effect====\nIn 1889, Wallace wrote the book ''[[Darwinism (book)|Darwinism]]'', which explained and defended natural selection. In it, he proposed the hypothesis that natural selection could drive the reproductive isolation of two varieties by encouraging the development of barriers against hybridisation. Thus it might contribute to the development of new species. He suggested the following scenario: When two populations of a species had diverged beyond a certain point, each adapted to particular conditions, hybrid offspring would be less adapted than either parent form and so natural selection would tend to eliminate the hybrids. Furthermore, under such conditions, natural selection would favour the development of barriers to hybridisation, as individuals that avoided hybrid matings would tend to have more fit offspring, and thus contribute to the reproductive isolation of the two incipient species. \n\nThis idea came to be known as the [[Wallace effect]],<ref>Slotten pp. 413\u201315.</ref> later referred to as [[Reinforcement (speciation)|reinforcement]].<ref name=\"Speciation\">{{Citation | title=Speciation | author=Jerry A.

Darwin had not yet publicly addressed the subject, although [[Thomas Huxley]] had in ''[[Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature]]''. He explained the apparent stability of the human stock by pointing to the vast gap in cranial capacities between humans and the great apes. Unlike some other Darwinists, including Darwin himself, he did not \"regard modern primitives as almost filling the gap between man and ape\".<ref name=eiseley>{{cite book |last=Eiseley |first=Loren |title=Darwin's Century |publisher=Anchor Book |year=1958 |pages=305, 06}}</ref> \n\nHe saw the evolution of humans in two stages: achieving a bipedal posture freeing the hands to carry out the dictates of the brain, and the \"recognition of the human brain as a totally new factor in the history of life. Wallace was apparently the first evolutionist to recognize clearly that&nbsp;... with the emergence of that bodily specialization which constitutes the human brain, bodily specialization itself might be said to be outmoded.\"<ref name=eiseley /> For this paper he won Darwin's praise.\n\nShortly afterwards, Wallace became a [[spiritualism|spiritualist]]. At about the same time, he began to maintain that natural selection cannot account for mathematical, artistic, or musical genius, as well as metaphysical musings, and wit and humour. He eventually said that something in \"the unseen universe of Spirit\" had interceded at least three times in history. The first was the creation of life from inorganic matter. The second was the introduction of consciousness in the higher animals. And the third was the generation of the higher mental faculties in humankind. He also believed that the [[wikt:raison d'\u00eatre|raison d'\u00eatre]] of the universe was the development of the human spirit.<ref>Wallace ''Darwinism'' p. 477.</ref> These views greatly disturbed Darwin, who argued that spiritual appeals were not necessary and that [[sexual selection]] could easily explain apparently non-adaptive mental phenomena. \n\nWhile some historians have concluded that Wallace's belief that natural selection was insufficient to explain the development of consciousness and the human mind was directly caused by his adoption of spiritualism, other Wallace scholars have disagreed, and some maintain that Wallace never believed natural selection applied to those areas.<ref>Shermer pp. 157\u201360.</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Charles H.|title=Alfred Russel Wallace: Evolution of an Evolutionist Chapter Six.

One historian of science has pointed out that, through both private correspondence and published works, Darwin and Wallace exchanged knowledge and stimulated each other's ideas and theories over an extended period.<ref>Shermer p. 149.</ref> Wallace is the most-cited naturalist in Darwin's ''[[Descent of Man]]'', occasionally in strong disagreement.<ref>Slotten pp. 289\u201390.</ref>\n\nBoth Darwin and Wallace agreed on the importance of natural selection, and some of the factors responsible for it: competition between species and geographical isolation. But Wallace believed that evolution had a purpose (\"teleology\") in maintaining species' fitness to their environment, whereas Darwin hesitated to attribute any purpose to a random natural process. Scientific discoveries since the 19th century support Darwin's viewpoint, by identifying several additional mechanisms and triggers:\n* Mutations in germ-line DNA (i.e., DNA of the sperm or egg, which manifest in the offspring). These occur spontaneously, or are triggered by environmental radiation or mutagenic chemicals. A recently discovered mechanism, which is likely to be more important than the others combined, is infections with viruses, which integrate their DNA into their hosts.<ref>Garry Hamilton.

Most of the mutations are harmful or lethal to the offspring, but a very small minority turn out to be advantageous, as novel proteins get produced that serve new functions.\n* [[Epigenetic]] mechanisms, where evolution can occur in the absence of change in DNA sequence, through various mechanisms including chemical modifications to the DNA bases.\n* Cataclysmic events (meteorite/asteroid impacts, volcanism) that cause [[mass extinction]]s of species that, until the event, were perfectly adapted to their environment, such as the dinosaurs. The dramatic reduction of competition among the surviving species makes newly evolved species more likely to survive.\n\nWallace remained an ardent defender of natural selection for the rest of his life. By the 1880s, evolution was widely accepted in scientific circles, but natural selection less so.  In 1889, Wallace published the book ''[[Darwinism (book)|Darwinism]]'' as a response to the scientific critics of natural selection.<ref>Slotten p. 409.</ref> Of all Wallace's books, it is the most cited by scholarly publications.<ref>Shermer p. 18.</ref>\n\n==Other scientific contributions==\n\n===Biogeography and ecology===\n[[File:Wallace03.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A map of the world from ''The Geographical Distribution of Animals'' shows Wallace's six biogeographical regions.]]\n\nIn 1872, at the urging of many of his friends, including Darwin, [[Philip Sclater]], and [[Alfred Newton]], Wallace began research for a general review of the geographic distribution of animals. Initial progres was slow, in part because classification systems for many types of animals were in flux.<ref>Slotten p. 301.</ref> He resumed the work in earnest in 1874 after the publication of a number of new works on classification.<ref>Slotten p. 315.</ref> Extending the system developed by Sclater for birds\u2014which divided the earth into six separate geographic regions for describing species distribution\u2014to cover mammals, reptiles and insects as well, Wallace created the basis for the [[ecozone|zoogeographic regions]] still in use today. He discussed all of the factors then known to influence the current and past geographic distribution of animals within each geographic region. \n\nThese factors included the effects of the appearance and disappearance of land bridges (such as the one currently [[Great American Interchange|connecting North America and South America]]) and the effects of periods of increased glaciation. He provided maps showing factors, such as elevation of mountains, depths of oceans, and the character of regional vegetation, that affected the distribution of animals. He also summarised all the known families and genera of the higher animals and listed their known geographic distributions. The text was organised so that it would be easy for a traveller to learn what animals could be found in a particular location. The resulting two-volume work, ''The Geographical Distribution of Animals'', was published in 1876 and served as the definitive text on [[zoogeography]] for the next 80 years.<ref>Slotten pp. 320\u201325.</ref>\n\nThe book included evidence from the fossil record to discuss the processes of evolution and migration that had led to the geographical distribution of modern species. For example, he discussed how fossil evidence showed that [[tapirs]] had originated in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], migrating between North America and Eurasia and then, much more recently, to South America after which the northern species became extinct, leaving the modern distribution of two isolated groups of tapir species in South America and Southeast Asia.<ref>Bowler (2013), p. 152.</ref> Wallace was very aware of, and interested in, the [[Quaternary extinction event|mass extinction of megafauna]] in the late [[Pleistocene]]. In ''The Geographical Distribution of Animals'' (1876) he wrote, \"We live in a zoologically impoverished world, from which all the hugest, and fiercest, and strangest forms have recently disappeared\".<ref>Wallace ''The Geographical Distribution of Animals'' p. 150.</ref> He added that he believed the most likely cause for the rapid extinctions was glaciation, but by the time he wrote ''World of Life'' (1911) he had come to believe those extinctions were \"due to man's agency\".<ref>Wallace ''The World of Life'' (1911) p. 264.</ref>\n[[File:Wallace-line1.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.7|The line separating the Indo-Malayan and the Austro-Malayan region in Wallace's ''On the Physical Geography of the Malay Archipelago'' (1863)]]\nIn 1880, Wallace published the book ''Island Life'' as a sequel to ''The Geographical Distribution of Animals''. It surveyed the distribution of both animal and plant species on islands. Wallace classified islands into oceanic and two types of continental islands. \n\nOceanic islands, such as the [[Galapagos]] and [[Hawaiian Islands]] (then called Sandwich Islands) formed in mid-ocean and never part of any large continent. Such islands were characterised by a complete lack of terrestrial mammals and amphibians, and their inhabitants (except migratory birds and species introduced by humans) were typically the result of accidental colonisation and subsequent evolution.  \n\nContinental islands were divided into those that were recently separated from a continent (like Britain) and those much less recently (like [[Madagascar]]). Wallace discussed how that difference affected flora and fauna. He discussed how isolation affected evolution and how that could result in the preservation of classes of animals, such as the [[lemur]]s of Madagascar that were remnants of once widespread continental faunas. He extensively discussed how changes of climate, particularly periods of increased [[glaciation]], may have affected the distribution of flora and fauna on some islands, and the first portion of the book discusses possible causes of these great [[ice age]]s. ''Island Life'' was considered a very important work at the time of its publication. It was discussed extensively in scientific circles both in published reviews and in private correspondence.<ref>Slotten p. 361.</ref> \n\n===Environmental issues===\nWallace's extensive work in biogeography made him aware of the impact of human activities on the natural world. In ''Tropical Nature and Other Essays'' (1878), he warned about the dangers of deforestation and soil erosion, especially in tropical climates prone to heavy rainfall. Noting the complex interactions between vegetation and climate, he warned that the extensive clearing of [[rainforest]] for coffee cultivation in Ceylon (now called [[Sri Lanka]]) and India would adversely impact the climate in those countries and lead to their impoverishment due to soil erosion.<ref>Slotten pp. 352\u201353.</ref> In ''Island Life'', Wallace again mentioned deforestation and [[invasive species]]. On the impact of European colonisation on the island of [[Saint Helena]], he wrote:\n\n{{quote|&nbsp;yet the general aspect of the island is now so barren and forbidding that some persons find it difficult to believe that it was once all green and fertile. The cause of this change is, however, very easily explained. The rich soil formed by decomposed volcanic rock and vegetable deposits could only be retained on the steep slopes so long as it was protected by the vegetation to which it in great part owed its origin. When this was destroyed, the heavy tropical rains soon washed away the soil, and has left a vast expanse of bare rock or sterile clay. This irreparable destruction was caused, in the first place, by goats, which were introduced by the Portuguese in 1513, and increased so rapidly that in 1588 they existed in the thousands. These animals are the greatest of all foes to trees, because they eat off the young seedlings, and thus prevent the natural restoration of the forest. They were, however, aided by the reckless waste of man. The East India Company took possession of the island in 1651, and about the year 1700 it began to be seen that the forests were fast diminishing, and required some protection. Two of the native trees, redwood and ebony, were good for tanning, and, to save trouble, the bark was wastefully stripped from the trunks only, the remainder being left to rot; while in 1709 a large quantity of the rapidly disappearing ebony was used to burn lime for building fortifications!<ref>Wallace ''Island Life'' pp. 283\u201384.</ref>}}\n\nWallace's comments on environment grew more strident later in his career. In ''The World of Life'' (1911) he wrote:\n\n{{quote| These considerations should lead us to look upon all the works of nature, animate or inanimate, as invested with a certain sanctity, to be used by us but not abused, and never to be recklessly destroyed or defaced. To pollute a spring or a river, to exterminate a bird or beast, should be treated as moral offences and as social crimes;&nbsp;... Yet during the past century, which has seen those great advances in the knowledge of Nature of which we are so proud, there has been no corresponding development of a love or reverence for her works; so that never before has there been such widespread ravage of the earth's surface by destruction of native vegetation and with it of much animal life, and such wholesale defacement of the earth by mineral workings and by pouring into our streams and rivers the refuse of manufactories and of cities; and this has been done by all the greatest nations claiming the first place for civilisation and religion!<ref>Wallace ''World of Life'' p. 279.</ref>}}\n\n===Astrobiology===\nWallace's 1904 book ''Man's Place in the Universe'' was the first serious attempt by a biologist to evaluate the [[planetary habitability|likelihood of life on other planets]]. He concluded that the Earth was the only planet in the solar system that could possibly support life, mainly because it was the only one in which water could exist in the [[liquid phase]]. More controversially he maintained that it was unlikely that other stars in the galaxy could have planets with the necessary properties (the existence of other galaxies not having been proved at the time).\n\nHis treatment of [[Mars]] in this book was brief, and in 1907, Wallace returned to the subject with a book ''Is Mars Habitable?'' to criticise the claims made by [[Percival Lowell]] that there were [[Martian canals]] built by intelligent beings. Wallace did months of research, consulted various experts, and produced his own scientific analysis of the Martian climate and atmospheric conditions.<ref>Slotten p. 474.</ref> Among other things, Wallace pointed out that [[spectroscopic analysis]] had shown no signs of [[water vapour]] in the [[Martian atmosphere]], that Lowell's analysis of Mars's climate was seriously flawed and badly overestimated the surface temperature, and that low atmospheric pressure would make liquid water, let alone a planet-girding irrigation system, impossible.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred|title=''Is Mars Habitable'' (S730: 1907)|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/S730.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=13 May 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070405172431/http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/S730.htm| archivedate= 5 April 2007 |url-status = live}}</ref> Richard Milner comments: \"It was the brilliant and eccentric evolutionist Alfred Russel Wallace&nbsp;... who effectively debunked Lowell's illusionary network of Martian canals.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=A Wet Red World?

Stately palm-trees rise\n\nOn every side, and numerous trees unknown\n\nSave by strange names uncouth to English ears.\n\nHere I dwelt awhile the one white man\n\nAmong perhaps two hundred living souls.\n\nThey pass a peaceful and contented life'\n\nThe poem is a lyrical description of the life of a tribe he was living with along the Amazon river. While it has echoes of [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]] in the rhymes and rhythms the poem itself is not overly Romantic, serving more as a tool to set the scene and then draw contrast between the lives of the people living here and those in England. The poem is a comment on savagery and greed, making the point that some in England were more 'savage' than those on the Amazon, either by a greed for gold or by their greed for gold driving others into poverty.\n\nWallace concludes:\n\nI'd be an Indian here, and live content\n\nTo fish, and hunt, and paddle my canoe,\n\nAnd see my children grow, like young wild fawns,\n\nIn health of body and in peace of mind,\n\nRich without wealth, and happy without gold !\n\nThe poem is referenced and partially recited in the BBC television series '[[The Ascent of Man]]'.\n\n==Controversies==\n\n===Spiritualism<!--linked from 'Spiritualism (philosophy)'-->===\nIn a letter to his brother-in-law in 1861, Wallace wrote:\n\n{{quote|&nbsp;I remain an utter disbeliever in almost all that you consider the most sacred truths. I will pass over as utterly contemptible the oft-repeated accusation that sceptics shut out evidence because they will not be governed by the morality of Christianity&nbsp;... I am thankful I can see much to admire in all religions. To the mass of mankind religion of some kind is a necessity. But whether there be a God and whatever be His nature; whether we have an immortal soul or not, or whatever may be our state after death, I can have no fear of having to suffer for the study of nature and the search for truth, or believe that those will be better off in a future state who have lived in the belief of doctrines inculcated from childhood, and which are to them rather a matter of blind faith than intelligent conviction.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred|title=1861 Letter from Wallace to Thomas Sims|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/quotes.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=4 April 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070220201439/http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/quotes.htm| archivedate= 20 February 2007 <!--DASHBot-->|url-status = live}}</ref>}}\n\nWallace was an enthusiast of [[phrenology]].<ref>Slotten pp. 203\u201305.</ref> Early in his career, he experimented with [[hypnosis]], then known as [[mesmerism]].

In 1893, he wrote:\n\n{{quote|I thus learnt my first great lesson in the inquiry into these obscure fields of knowledge, never to accept the disbelief of great men or their accusations of imposture or of imbecility, as of any weight when opposed to the repeated observation of facts by other men, admittedly sane and honest.

For the rest of his life, he remained convinced that at least some s\u00e9ance phenomena were genuine, no matter how many accusations of fraud sceptics made or how much evidence of trickery was produced. Historians and biographers have disagreed about which factors most influenced his adoption of spiritualism.

His vehement defence of spiritualism strained his relationships with previously friendly scientists such as [[Henry Walter Bates|Henry Bates]], [[Thomas Huxley]], and even Darwin, who felt he was overly credulous. Evidence of this can be seen in Wallace's letters dated 22 November and 1 December 1866, to Thomas Huxley asking him if he would be interested in getting involved in scientific spiritualist investigations which Huxley, politely but emphatically, declined on the basis that he had neither the time nor the inclination.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/scientific-resources/collections/library-collections/wallace-letters-online/index.html|title=Wallace Letters Online|last=Wallace|first=Alfred Russel|date=16 November 2010|website=The Alfred Russel Wallace Correspondence Project|access-date=}}</ref> Others, such as the physiologist [[William Benjamin Carpenter]] and zoologist [[E. Ray Lankester]] became openly and publicly hostile to Wallace over the issue. Wallace and other scientists who defended spiritualism, notably William Crookes, were subject to much criticism from the press, with ''[[The Lancet]]'' as the leading English medical journal of the time being particularly harsh. The controversy affected the public perception of Wallace's work for the rest of his career.<ref>Slotten pp. 298\u2013351.</ref> When, in 1879, Darwin first tried to rally support among naturalists to get a civil pension awarded to Wallace, [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Joseph Hooker]] responded:\n\n{{quote|Wallace has lost caste considerably, not only by his adhesion to Spiritualism, but by the fact of his having deliberately and against the whole voice of the committee of his section of the British Association, brought about a discussion on Spiritualism at one of its sectional meetings&nbsp;...

Wallace, intrigued by the challenge and short of money at the time, designed an experiment in which he set up two objects along a six-mile (10&nbsp;km) stretch of canal. Both objects were at the same height above the water, and he mounted a telescope on a bridge at the same height above the water as well. When seen through the telescope, one object appeared higher than the other, showing the curvature of the earth.\n\nThe judge for the wager, the editor of ''Field'' magazine, declared Wallace the winner, but Hampden refused to accept the result. He sued Wallace and launched a campaign, which persisted for several years, of writing letters to various publications and to organisations of which Wallace was a member denouncing him as a swindler and a thief. Wallace won multiple libel suits against Hampden, but the resulting litigation cost Wallace more than the amount of the wager, and the controversy frustrated him for years.<ref>Shermer pp. 258\u201361.</ref>\n\n===Anti-vaccination campaign===\nIn the early 1880s, Wallace was drawn into the debate over mandatory smallpox [[vaccination]]. Wallace originally saw the issue as a matter of personal liberty; but, after studying some of the statistics provided by anti-vaccination activists, he began to question the efficacy of vaccination. At the time, the [[germ theory of disease]] was very new and far from universally accepted. Moreover, no one knew enough about the human [[immune system]] to understand why vaccination worked. When Wallace did some research, he discovered instances where supporters of vaccination had used questionable, in a few cases completely phony, statistics to support their arguments. Always suspicious of authority, Wallace suspected that physicians had a vested interest in promoting vaccination, and became convinced that reductions in the incidence of smallpox that had been attributed to vaccination were, in fact, due to better hygiene and improvements in public sanitation.<ref name=\"Slotten422-436\">Slotten pp. 422\u201336.</ref>\n\nAnother factor in Wallace's thinking was his belief that, because of the action of natural selection, organisms were in a state of balance with their environment, and that everything in nature, even disease-causing organisms, served a useful purpose in the natural order of things; he feared vaccination might upset that natural balance with unfortunate results.<ref name=\"Shermer215\"/> Wallace and other anti-vaccinationists pointed out that vaccination, which at the time was often done in a sloppy and unsanitary manner, could be dangerous.<ref name=\"Shermer215\">Shermer pp. 215\u201316.</ref>\n\nIn 1890, Wallace gave evidence before a [[Royal Commission]] investigating the controversy. When the commission examined the material he had submitted to support his testimony, they found errors, including some questionable statistics. ''[[The Lancet]]'' averred that Wallace and the other anti-vaccination activists were being selective in their choice of statistics, ignoring large quantities of data inconsistent with their position. The commission found that smallpox vaccination was effective and should remain compulsory, though they did recommend some changes in procedures to improve safety, and that the penalties for people who refused to comply be made less severe. Years later, in 1898, Wallace wrote a pamphlet, ''Vaccination a Delusion; Its Penal Enforcement a Crime'', attacking the commission's findings. It, in turn, was attacked by ''The Lancet'', which stated that it contained many of the same errors as his evidence given to the commission.<ref name=\"Slotten422-436\"/>\n\n==Legacy and historical perception==\n[[File:Alfred Russel Wallace - Project Gutenberg eText 14558.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Wallace and his signature on the frontispiece of ''Darwinism'' (1889)]]\n\nAs a result of his writing, at the time of his death Wallace had been for many years a well-known figure both as a scientist and as a social activist. He was often sought out by journalists and others for his views on a variety of topics.<ref>Shermer pp. 292\u201394.</ref> He received honorary doctorates and a number of professional honours, such the [[Royal Society]]'s [[Royal Medal]] and [[Darwin Medal]] in 1868 and 1890 respectively,<ref name=eb1911>{{Cite EB1911 | wstitle=Wallace, Alfred Russel}}</ref> and the [[Order of Merit]] in 1908.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=28194 |supp=y|page=8162|date=9 November 1908}}</ref> Above all, his role as the co-discoverer of natural selection and his work on zoogeography marked him out as an exceptional figure.\n\nHe was undoubtedly one of the greatest natural history explorers of the 19th century. Despite this, his fame faded quickly after his death. For a long time, he was treated as a relatively obscure figure in the history of science.<ref name = \"Slotten_p6\"/> A number of reasons have been suggested for this lack of attention, including his modesty, his willingness to champion unpopular causes without regard for his own reputation, and the discomfort of much of the scientific community with some of his unconventional ideas.\n\nRecently, he has become a less obscure figure with the publication of several book-length biographies on him, as well as anthologies of his writings. In 2007 a literary critic for ''New Yorker'' magazine observed that five such biographies and two such anthologies had been published since 2000.<ref>{{cite web |last=Rosen |first=Jonathan |title=Missing Link: Alfred Russel Wallace, Charles Darwin's neglected double |url=https://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2007/02/12/070212crat_atlarge_rosen |publisher=The New Yorker Feb 2007|accessdate=25 April 2007}}</ref> There has also been a web page created that is dedicated to Wallace scholarship.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page |url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/index1.htm |publisher=hosted by Western Kentucky University |accessdate=13 May 2007 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070523065328/http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/index1.htm| archivedate= 23 May 2007 |url-status = live}}</ref>\nIn a 2010 book, the environmentalist [[Tim Flannery]] claimed that Wallace was 'the first modern scientist to comprehend how essential cooperation is to our survival,'<ref>Flannery, p. 32.</ref> and suggested that Wallace's understanding of natural selection and his later work on the atmosphere be seen as a forerunner to modern ecological thinking.\n[[File:Bronze statue of Alfred Russel Wallace.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Anthony Smith (sculptor)|Anthony Smith's]] statue of Wallace, looking up at a bronze model of a [[Ornithoptera croesus|Wallace's golden birdwing butterfly]].

In 2002, a historian of science published a quantitative analysis of Wallace's publications. He found that Wallace had published 22 full-length books and at least 747 shorter pieces, 508 of which were scientific papers (191 of them published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''). He further broke down the 747 short pieces by their primary subjects as follows. 29% were on biogeography and natural history, 27% were on evolutionary theory, 25% were social commentary, 12% were on Anthropology, and 7% were on spiritualism and phrenology.<ref>Shermer pp. 15\u201317.</ref> An online bibliography of Wallace's writings has more than 750 entries.<ref name=\"Bibliography\"/>\n\n===Selected books===\n* {{cite book\n|title=Palm trees of the Amazon and their uses.\n|last=Wallace\n|first=Alfred Russel\n|year=1853\n|publisher=London\n|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/42833\n|format=Biodiversity Heritage Library\n}}\n* {{cite book\n|last=Wallace\n|first=Alfred Russel\n|year=1869\n|title=The Malay Archipelago\n|publisher=Harper\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EldIBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Rajendra+Chola+zulkarnain\n|isbn=9781776580736\n}}\n* {{cite book\n|last=Wallace\n|first=Alfred Russel\n|title=Contributions to the Theory of Natural Selection\n|url=https://archive.org/details/contributionsto03wallgoog\n|format=Google Books\n|edition=2nd\n|year=1870\n|publisher=Macmillan and Company\n}}\n* {{cite book\n|last=Wallace\n|first=Alfred Russel\n|title=The Geographical Distribution of Animals\n|url=https://archive.org/details/geographicaldis01wallgoog\n|format=Google Books\n|year=1876\n|publisher=Harper and brothers\n}}\n* {{cite book\n|title=Tropical Nature, and Other Essays\n|last=Wallace |first=Alfred Russel\n|year=1878\n|publisher=Macmillan\n|url=https://archive.org/details/tropicalnaturea00wallgoog\n|format=Google Books\n}}\n* {{cite book\n|last=Wallace\n|first=Alfred Russel\n|title=Island Life\n|url=https://archive.org/details/islandlifeorphe02wallgoog\n|year=1881\n|publisher=Harper and brothers\n}}\n* {{cite book\n|last=Wallace\n|first=Alfred Russel\n|title=Darwinism: An Exposition of the Theory of Natural Selection, with Some of Its Applications\n|url=https://archive.org/details/darwinismanexpo04wallgoog\n|year=1889\n|publisher=Macmillan }}\n* {{cite book|last=Wallace|first=Alfred Russel|title=Travels on the Amazon and Rio Negro|url=https://archive.org/details/narrativeoftrave00wall|format=Internet Archive|edition=1889|location=|pages=|year=1889|isbn=|publisher=Ward, Lock}}\n* {{cite book\n|title=Man's Place in the Universe\n|last=Wallace\n|first=Alfred Russel\n|year=1903\n|publisher=Chapman & Hall\n|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39928\n|format=Gutenberg\n}}\n* {{cite book\n|title=My Life\n|last=Wallace\n|first=Alfred Russel\n|year=1905\n|publisher=Chapman & Hall\n|url=https://archive.org/details/b31360580_0002\n|format=Google Books\n}}\n\n===Selected papers===\n* 1853: On the Monkeys of the Amazon.
