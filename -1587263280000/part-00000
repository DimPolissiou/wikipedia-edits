[[Friz Freleng]] (a close friend of [[Joseph Barbera]]) served as creative producer for the series as his and [[David H. DePatie]]'s production company, DePatie\u2013Freleng Enterprises, existed as an in-name-only enterprise by this time, as its operations were absorbed by [[Marvel Productions]] in 1981.\n\n==Plot==\nThe series centers on [[Pink Panther (character)|The Pink Panther]]'s two sons: pre-teen Pinky, his brother, toddler Panky and their friends in the Rainbow Panthers crew (the pretty Chatta, fighting Rocko, gibberish-talking Murfel, overalls-wearing Annie, and mixed-up-talking Punkin). Each episode shows the Rainbow Panthers coming together for friendship and fun as they learn all about growing up and caring for each other as they take on a group of lions called the Howl Angels.\n\nFeatured in each episode would be short three to five minutes cartoons featuring The Pink Panther bookending the main cartoons with Pinky and Panky.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Rainbow Panthers===\n* Pinky (voiced by Billy Bowles) - Pinky is a very polite young panther.

He is in love with Chatta, a purple panther in the group.\n* Panky (voiced by [[Betty Jean Ward|B.J. Ward]]) \u2013 Panky is Pinky's little brother. His diaper is never tied correctly so he just holds it wherever he goes. Since he is still a toddler, he is considered very impressionable.\n* Chatta (voiced by [[Sherry Lynn]]) \u2013 Chatta is a purple panther. She is in love with Pinky and often tries to impress him to win his affection.

He muffles or mixes up everything that he says.\n* Rocko (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]) \u2013 Rocko is a yellow panther who is very athletic. He is always seen sporting boxing gloves.\n* Annie O'Gizmo (voiced by [[Jeannie Elias]]) \u2013 Annie is an orange panther wearing overalls and is the most scientific of the group.\n* Punkin (voiced by B.J. Ward) \u2013 Punkin is a blue panther who wears a baseball cap and a wooly jumper. He is rather dense.\n* The Pink Panther \u2013 He is the mute father of Pinky and Panky.\n\n===Howl Angels===\n* Finko (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]) \u2013 Finko is the leader of the Howl Angels. He is a rival to Pinky and one time was babysitter to Panky at the time when Pinky and Chatta go on a date to the movies.\n* Howl (voiced by [[Marshall Efron]]) \u2013 Howl is a right-hand man to Finko.\n* Liona (voiced by [[Jeannie Elias]]) \u2013 Liona is a lioness, she is tough but pretty, she has a crush on Rainbow Panthers club leader Pinky.

The series was originally broadcast on [[NBC]] from 1984 to 1985 and moved to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1986. [[Friz Freleng]] (a close friend of [[Joseph Barbera]]) served as creative producer for the series as his and [[David H. DePatie]]'s production company, DePatie\u2013Freleng Enterprises, existed as an in-name-only enterprise by this time, as its operations were absorbed by [[Marvel Productions]] in 1981.\n\n==Plot==\nThe series centers on [[Pink Panther (character)|The Pink Panther]]'s two sons: pre-teen Pinky, his brother, toddler Panky and their friends in the Rainbow Panthers crew (the pretty Chatta, fighting Rocko, gibberish-talking Murfel, overalls-wearing Annie, and mixed-up-talking Punkin). Each episode shows the Rainbow Panthers coming together for friendship and fun as they learn all about growing up and caring for each other as they take on a group of lions called the Howl Angels.\n\nFeatured in each episode would be short three to five minutes cartoons featuring The Pink Panther bookending the main cartoons with Pinky and Panky.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Rainbow Panthers===\n* Pinky (voiced by Billy Bowles) - Pinky is a very polite young panther.

He is in love with Chatta, a purple panther in the group.\n* Panky (voiced by [[Betty Jean Ward|B.J. Ward]]) \u2013 Panky is Pinky's little brother. His diaper is never tied correctly so he just holds it wherever he goes. Since he is still a toddler, he is considered very impressionable.\n* Chatta (voiced by [[Sherry Lynn]]) \u2013 Chatta is a purple panther. She is in love with Pinky and often tries to impress him to win his affection.

He muffles or mixes up everything that he says.\n* Rocko (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]) \u2013 Rocko is a yellow panther who is very athletic. He is always seen sporting boxing gloves.\n* Annie O'Gizmo (voiced by [[Jeannie Elias]]) \u2013 Annie is an orange panther wearing overalls and is the most scientific of the group.\n* Punkin (voiced by B.J. Ward) \u2013 Punkin is a blue panther who wears a baseball cap and a wooly jumper. He is rather dense.\n* The Pink Panther \u2013 He is the mute father of Pinky and Panky.\n\n===Howl Angels===\n* Finko (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]) \u2013 Finko is the leader of the Howl Angels. He is a rival to Pinky and one time was babysitter to Panky at the time when Pinky and Chatta go on a date to the movies.\n* Howl (voiced by [[Marshall Efron]]) \u2013 Howl is a right-hand man to Finko.\n* Liona (voiced by [[Jeannie Elias]]) \u2013 Liona is a lioness, she is tough but pretty, she has a crush on Rainbow Panthers club leader Pinky.

For example, CentOS&nbsp;6.5 is built from the source [[Package (package management system)|packages]] of RHEL&nbsp;6 update&nbsp;5 (also known as RHEL version&nbsp;6.5), which is a so-called \"point release\" of RHEL&nbsp;6.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://wiki.centos.org/FAQ/General#head-6e2c3746ec45ac3142917466760321e868f43c0e |title=What is the versioning/release scheme of CentOS and how does it compare to the upstream vendor? |website=centos.org |access-date=21 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nStarting with version 7.0, CentOS version numbers also include a third part that indicates the [[monthstamp]] of the source code the release is based on. For example, version number 7.0-1406 still maps this CentOS release to the zeroth update set of RHEL&nbsp;7, while \"1406\" indicates that the source code this release is based on dates from June 2014. Using the monthstamp allows installation images to be reissued for ({{As of|2014|7|lc=yes}}) oncoming container and cloud releases, while maintaining a connection to the related base release version.<ref name=\"CentOS7.0Announcement\" />\n\nSince mid-2006 and starting with RHEL version 4.4, which is formally known as Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.0 update 4, Red Hat has adopted a version-naming convention identical to that used by CentOS (for example, RHEL&nbsp;4.5 or RHEL&nbsp;6.5).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/FAQ_80_10667.shtm |title=Red Hat Enterprise Linux > AS/ES/WS Basics |publisher=[[Red Hat]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014193548/http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/FAQ_80_10667.shtm |archive-date=14 October 2008 |access-date=26 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn 10 September 2019 CentOS deferred CentOS 8 work for CentOS 7.7 since CentOS 7.x was in production and CentOS 8.x was not in production.

For example, CentOS&nbsp;6.5 is built from the source [[Package (package management system)|packages]] of RHEL&nbsp;6 update&nbsp;5 (also known as RHEL version&nbsp;6.5), which is a so-called \"point release\" of RHEL&nbsp;6.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://wiki.centos.org/FAQ/General#head-6e2c3746ec45ac3142917466760321e868f43c0e |title=What is the versioning/release scheme of CentOS and how does it compare to the upstream vendor? |website=centos.org |access-date=21 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nStarting with version 7.0, CentOS version numbers also include a third part that indicates the [[monthstamp]] of the source code the release is based on. For example, version number 7.0-1406 still maps this CentOS release to the zeroth update set of RHEL&nbsp;7, while \"1406\" indicates that the source code this release is based on dates from June 2014. Using the monthstamp allows installation images to be reissued for ({{As of|2014|7|lc=yes}}) oncoming container and cloud releases, while maintaining a connection to the related base release version.<ref name=\"CentOS7.0Announcement\" />\n\nSince mid-2006 and starting with RHEL version 4.4, which is formally known as Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.0 update 4, Red Hat has adopted a version-naming convention identical to that used by CentOS (for example, RHEL&nbsp;4.5 or RHEL&nbsp;6.5).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/FAQ_80_10667.shtm |title=Red Hat Enterprise Linux > AS/ES/WS Basics |publisher=[[Red Hat]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014193548/http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/FAQ_80_10667.shtm |archive-date=14 October 2008 |access-date=26 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn 10 September 2019 CentOS deferred CentOS 8 work for CentOS 7.7 since CentOS 7.x was in production and CentOS 8.x was not in production.

Inspired by true life stories of genius prodigies like Thomas Alva Edison, Michael Faraday, and India A. P. J.

She brings him to live with her in the slum. With his friends, he makes a living picking up rags. An encounter with some school students who call him an uneducated brute changes the life of this slum boy. This makes him take up a challenge to get educated. How this boy finds a way to live his dream: going to school to get an education, amidst all odds and evens is the line of the story. Inspired by true life stories of great people like Thomas Alva Edison, Michael Faraday, and India's former president A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, it is a successful film about the life of a young street boy. The film was originally released in Kannada on 26 November 2006.

This movie was made for the underprivileged who want to fight their disabilities with courage. The main message of my movie is 'no matter what you are and no matter how weak you are, every thing is mind over matter and if one believes in this, nothing on this earth can stop them.' Inspired by true life stories of genius prodigies like Thomas Alva Edison, Michael Faraday, and India A. P. J.
