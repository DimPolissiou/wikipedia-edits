They are usually five spots per category and the committee will vote to determine which top five are to remain in the category. There may be more than five nominees if there is a tie in the nomination process.\n\n===Final Voting Process ===\nAfter nominees have been determine released, online voting is open to the public for a period of 30\u201360 days. Upon closing of the public voting system, the three judges are called upon to vote.

{"title_page": "Magical objects in Harry Potter", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Overly detailed|date=December 2016}}\n{{In-universe|date=August 2017}}\n{{More citations needed|date=January 2017}}\n{{Cleanup rewrite|date=March 2017}}\n}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2013}}\n{{Use British English|date=August 2011}}\nThe following is a list of [[Magic in fiction|magical objects]] used in the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series. \n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Magical objects in ''Harry Potter''}}\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Communication==\n===Enchanted coins===\nIn ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', [[Hermione Granger]] creates fake, enchanted Galleons ([[Wizard (fantasy)|Wizard]] money) or as they call it (enchanted coins) that are used for communication between members of [[Dumbledore's Army]] (the DA). Like real Galleons, the coins have numerals around the edge. On normal Galleons these serial numbers signify the goblin who cast the coin; on the enchanted Galleons, the numbers represent the time and date of the next D.A. meeting, and automatically change to match whatever numbers [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] sets on his coin.{{HP5}} Due to the coins being infused with a Protean Charm, once Harry Potter alters his, every coin changes to suit. The coins grow hot when the numbers change to alert the members to look at their coins.\n\nIn ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', [[Draco Malfoy]] uses a pair of enchanted coins to bypass the communication limits imposed on [[Hogwarts]], thus managing to keep in contact with [[Madam Rosmerta]], whom he had placed under the Imperius Curse. Draco reveals he got the idea from Hermione's DA (Dumbledore's army)  coins, which were themselves inspired by [[Lord Voldemort]]'s use of the [[Dark Mark]] to communicate with his [[Death Eater]]s.\n\nIn ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', [[Neville Longbottom]] uses the DA's (Dumbledore's army) coins to alert people such as [[Luna Lovegood]] and [[Ginny Weasley]] that Harry, Ron and Hermione have returned to Hogwarts. They then arrive at the [[Room of Requirement]] to fight in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] on May 2, 1998.\n\n===Howler===\n[[File:Howler (Harry Potter) - 2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|A Howler sent to Ron Weasley]]\nA Howler is a blood-red letter sent to signify extreme anger or to convey a message very loudly and publicly. When it is opened, the sender's voice, which has been magically magnified to a deafening volume, bellows a message at the recipient and then self-destructs itself by burning. If it is not opened or there is a delay in opening it, the letter smoulders, explodes violently, and shouts the message out even louder than normal.{{HP2}} In the film version, the Howler folds itself into an [[origami]]-style set of lips and teeth and shouts the message out, and then shreds itself into scraps of paper before it burns itself.\n\nIn ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'', [[Ron Weasley]] receives a Howler from his mother, [[Molly Weasley]], after he steals his father's [[Ford Anglia|enchanted car]] and flies it to Hogwarts with Harry. [[Neville Longbottom]] confesses that he had once gotten a Howler from his [[Augusta Longbottom|grandmother]], stating that he ignored it and that the result was horrible. Subsequently, Neville receives another Howler from his grandmother after [[Sirius Black]] uses his list of passwords to enter the [[Gryffindor]] Common Room in ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]''. Hermione receives one in ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'' after [[Rita Skeeter]] publishes an article about the (fictional) relationship between Hermione and Harry. (In the film version, this incident is not referred to.) [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] sends Harry's aunt, [[Petunia Dursley]], a Howler in ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'' to remind her of the agreement to allow Harry to live at Privet Drive when Harry's [[Uncle Vernon]] attempts to throw him out. (This incident is not referred to in the film version.)\n\n==Concealers==\n===Deluminator (Put-Outer)===\n[[Image:Albdelumin.jpg|thumb|upright|Dumbledore is using his Deluminator in the film ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]]] A Deluminator is a device invented by Albus Dumbledore that resembles a [[Lighter|cigarette lighter]]. It is used to remove or absorb (as well as return) the light from any light source to provide cover to the user. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', Dumbledore uses the Deluminator (then referred to as the ''Put-Outer''){{HP1}}<!-- Sorcerer's Stone Chapter 1 - The Boy Who lived \"Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance\" --> to darken Privet Drive, where the [[Dursley family]]'s house is located. It was next seen in ''Order of the Phoenix'' where Dumbledore loans the Deluminator to Moody, who uses it when transporting Harry from the Dursleys' home to [[Number 12, Grimmauld Place]] ([[Sirius]]\u2019s  home).  In ''Half-Blood Prince'', Dumbledore uses the Deluminator again to darken Privet Drive before collecting Harry.\n\nIn ''Deathly Hallows'', it is bequeathed to Ron by Dumbledore. After Ron had left his friends in anger, the Deluminator demonstrated an additional capability, similar to a homing device. Ron hears Hermione through the device as she says his name for the first time since he left, and, when he clicks it, the emitted ball of light enters his body and allows him to locate and Apparate to the vicinity of Harry and Hermione's camp. Rowling stated Dumbledore left it to Ron because he believed he might have needed a little more guidance than Harry and Hermione.\n\n===Invisibility Cloak===\n{{See also|#Harry's Cloak of Invisibility|l1=Harry's Cloak of Invisibility}} Within the [[Harry Potter universe|''Harry Potter'' universe]], an [[Cloak of invisibility|invisibility cloak]] is used to make the wearer [[invisible]]. All are very rare and expensive, and may be spun from pelts of the Demiguise, magical herbivores that are found in the Far East. They can also be ordinary cloaks with a Disillusionment Charm or a Bedazzlement Hex placed on them. Over time, these cloaks will lose their invisibility ability, eventually becoming opaque and vulnerable to penetration by various spells.\n\nHarry's cloak, being one of the three Deathly Hallows, is a true cloak of invisibility, and will retain its invisibility forever. It is also resistant to most simple spells and charms (e.g. the summoning charm).<ref>{{HPref|book=7|chapter=21}}</ref> Invisibility cloaks protect the wearer from visual detection only, meaning that even though the wearer cannot be seen they are still solid, and can therefore be felt by physical contact. [[Alastor Moody]]'s magically charmed eye is able to penetrate them. The cloak is less effective against some animals, such as cats (e.g. [[Mrs. Norris]]) and snakes (e.g. [[Nagini (Harry Potter)|Nagini]]). The Dementors in the books have no sense of sight and instead sense human despair, a sense unhindered by the use of an invisibility cloak.\n\nMoody is also known to possess two invisibility cloaks. One of these was borrowed by [[Sturgis Podmore]] in the course of work for the [[Order of the Phoenix (organisation)|Order of the Phoenix]]. [[Barty Crouch, Sr.]] possessed one as well, which he used to hide his son Barty Crouch, Jr. to prevent him from going to [[Azkaban]], the wizarding prison. Several times in the series, characters have been shown to either suspect or in some other fashion \"sense\" that Harry is wearing his cloak: Snape is seen to be suspicious when being followed by Harry, even reaching out to grab at (what appears to be) thin air; in ''Half-Blood Prince'', [[Draco Malfoy]] realises Harry is in his train carriage and successfully immobilizes him with a Petrificus Totalus (Body-Bind) curse, as despite wearing his cloak Harry inadvertently moved objects near him; and in ''Chamber of Secrets'', Albus Dumbledore senses Harry and Ron beneath it in Hagrid's cabin while talking to Lucius Malfoy during the event when [[Cornelius Fudge]] comes to take Hagrid to [[Azkaban]] and Lucius Malfoy hands over to Dumbledore his suspension letter. This may be due to Dumbledore possessing another of the 3 Deathly Hallows, The Elder Wand.\n\n== Deathly Hallows ==\n[[File:Deathly Hallows Sign.svg|right|thumb|The sign of the Deathly Hallows represents all three objects symbolically: the Wand, the Stone, and the Cloak.]]\nThe Deathly Hallows are three magical objects that are the focus of ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'' \u2013 the Elder Wand, the Resurrection Stone, and a cloak of invisibility. When owned by one person, they are said to give mastery over death. The objects are generally remembered only as part of a wizard's [[fairy tale]] called ''[[The Tale of the Three Brothers]]'', and have become [[mythological]] over time, but a small number of wizards including [[Dumbledore]] still believe in their existence and seek them. According to Rowling, the story about how these objects came into existence is based upon [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Pardoner's Tale]]''.<ref name=\"webchat\">{{cite news|url=http://www.bloomsbury.com/harrypotter/content.asp?sec=3&sec2=1 |date=31 July 2007 |accessdate=31 July 2007 |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]] |title=Online Chat Transcript |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214064648/http://www.bloomsbury.com/harrypotter/content.asp?sec=3&sec2=1 |archivedate=14 February 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nAccording to the tale, three brothers evaded [[Death (personification)|Death]], who gave them a choice of anything they wanted. The first brother chose a wand that could not be defeated in battle, the second brother asked for a way to bring back someone from the dead, and the third brother selected a cloak that made the wearer invisible, even to Death himself. Eventually, the first brother was killed, the second committed [[suicide]], and finally, the third brother made Death a friend and gave the cloak to his son.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The tales of Beedle the Bard|last=Rowling|first=J.K.|publisher=A&C Black|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pottermore.com/book-extract-long/a-lesson-on-the-hallows|title=A lesson on the Hallows \u2013 Pottermore|work=Pottermore|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en}}</ref> The story is generally believed to refer to the [[Supporting Harry Potter characters#The Peverell brothers|Peverell brothers]] centuries ago, although very few actually believe the story to be fully true. Dumbledore believed that the Peverells were simply particularly powerful and ingenious wizard inventors. The sign of the Deathly Hallows had also been adopted as a personal symbol by dark wizard [[Supporting Harry Potter characters#Gellert Grindelwald|Gellert Grindelwald]]; therefore many wizards, such as [[Viktor Krum]], mistakenly understood it to be a symbol of dark magic.\n\nDumbledore had sought the Hallows, initially in his youth as a friend of Grindelwald for the power they were said to bestow, but later on as a means to undo the accidental death of his sister. He eventually concluded he was \"unworthy\" to possess them. He feels Harry could be a more worthy custodian but also fears Harry would be enamored of their power, therefore he guides Harry to them in a circuitous manner.\n\nBy contrast, Voldemort simply sought the wand for its supposedly unbeatable power, after his previous wand unaccountably failed to kill Harry Potter. He had not realised that the wand was one of three Hallows, nor sought the other two Hallows. He also possessed the Resurrection Stone but only made use of it as a [[horcrux]]. Dumbledore says that he doubts Voldemort would have any interest in the Cloak or the Stone even if he did know about them.<ref>The Deathly Hallows, page 340:  Harry \"And Voldemort never knew about the Hallows?\"  Dumbledore \"I do not think so, because he did not recognize the Resurrection Stone he turned into a Horcrux. But even if he had known about them, Harry, I doubt that he would have been interested in any except the first. He would not think that he needed the Cloak, and as for the stone, whom would he want to bring back from the dead? He fears the dead. He does not love.\"</ref>\n\nHarry eventually comes to possess all three Hallows \u2013 the cloak being inherited from his father James Potter, later understood to be a descendant of one of the Peverell brothers, the Resurrection Stone in the [[Golden Snitch]] bequeathed to him by Dumbledore, and the allegiance and mastery of the Elder Wand when he defeats and disarms its prior owner, [[Draco Malfoy]], who unwittingly won it from Dumbledore at the time of the latter's death.\n\nAfter Voldemort's death, Harry uses the Elder Wand to repair his own damaged wand, then decides to return it to Dumbledore's tomb, so that when he has a natural death, the Elder Wand's power will die with him. In the film, Harry realizes that the Elder Wand is too dangerous to fall into the wrong hands again, so he snaps it in two and throws it off a bridge. He also drops the Resurrection Stone in the [[Hogwarts#Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]] but decides not to look for it in the hope that no wizard or witch will ever be able to own all three Hallows. He keeps the Cloak he had inherited, with the thought that he might pass it on to his children someday.\n\n=== Elder Wand ===\n[[File:The Elder Wand.jpg|thumb|A toy replica of the Elder Wand used in the movie]]\nThe Elder Wand, known throughout history as the Deathstick or the Wand of Destiny,{{HP7}} is an extremely powerful [[#Wand|wand]] made of [[Sambucus|elder]] wood with a core of [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Thestrals|Thestral]] tail hair.<ref name=\"jkextra25\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=25 |title=Extra Stuff |publisher=J.K.Rowling Official Site | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071208163107/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=25 | archivedate = 2007-12-08 }}</ref> While most wizards have heard of supposedly invincible wands in wizarding history, wand experts and seekers after the Deathly Hallows realize that these are the same wand, reappearing periodically in the hand of a new owner.\n\nAccording to the legend, the wand's allegiance can only be won by killing its previous owner, and therefore its \"bloody trail\" had become \"splattered across the pages of wizarding history\", making it the Hallow most easily verified to be a real object. However, Harry discovers from [[Supporting Harry Potter characters#Garrick Ollivander|Garrick Ollivander]] the wandmaker that this popular understanding is incorrect; the Elder Wand actually transfers its loyalty upon the defeat or disarmament, and not necessarily the killing, of its previous master. It will never work fully for a new owner otherwise. This subtle distinction becomes the basis upon which Voldemort is finally defeated, when he believes he has won the wand's allegiance by killing Snape, who killed Dumbledore, while Harry realizes in fact he had defeated the wand's true owner, Draco Malfoy, who had disarmed Dumbledore before Snape killed him. This left Harry and not Voldemort as the wand's true master in their final encounter, even though neither Draco nor Harry had physically possessed the Elder Wand at that point.\n\nAccording to wizard [[folklore]], the Elder Wand used by its true master cannot be defeated in a [[duel]]; this is incorrect, for Dumbledore was able to defeat the legendary dark wizard [[Supporting Harry Potter characters#Gellert Grindelwald|Gellert Grindelwald]], who was the master of the Elder Wand at that point.<ref>The Tales of Beedle The Bard \u2013 Page 104</ref> It also appears, as the wand is somewhat sentient (as are all wands), that it will not allow itself to cause real harm to its true master. If its master dies naturally without ever being defeated or disarmed, the wand's exceptional power will end for any following owner, since it was never won from the former.\n\nThe power of the Elder Wand was first shown in history, as [[Supporting Harry Potter characters#The Peverell brothers|Antioch Peverell]], the eldest of the mythical Three Brothers, had a duel with an enemy he had long wanted to defeat. He won, and left his enemy dead on the floor; however after boasting of his unbeatable wand, Antioch was robbed and killed in his sleep by a rival wanting to take the wand. It eventually came to the possession of Mykew Gregorovitch, a Bulgarian wandmaker. Gregorovitch boasted about possessing the Elder Wand, believing it would boost his popularity, and he tried to [[Reverse engineering|reverse engineer]]{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} its secrets as he faced competition from Ollivander. It was stolen from him by Grindelwald, a former friend of Dumbledore who sought to impose wizard power in the world. Grindelwald was defeated \"at the height of his power\" by Dumbledore, who in his later years considered it the \"only hallow [he] was fit to possess, not to boast of it or kill with it, but to tame it.\"\n\nDumbledore arranged his own death with [[Severus Snape]], intending in part for Snape to \"end up with the Elder Wand.\" Because his death would have been pre-arranged and not the result of his defeat, he had hoped this might break the wand's power. However, [[Draco Malfoy]] disarmed Dumbledore before his death at the hands of Snape, causing the plan to fail; the wand was buried in Dumbledore's tomb, but Draco had already unwittingly become its new master, even though he never took physical possession of it from Dumbledore. After Harry defeats Draco (even though Draco is not using the Elder Wand), the wand becomes loyal to Harry instead.\n\nIn the final book, Voldemort seeks the wand in order to defeat Harry \u2013 his previous wands having failed \u2013 and breaks into Dumbledore's tomb to claim the wand as his own. During the Battle of Hogwarts, he understands that the wand is not performing for him as legend says it should, and mistakenly concludes this is because it had become loyal to [[Severus Snape|Snape]] when Snape killed Dumbledore, and would only become loyal to him upon his killing of Snape. He therefore kills Snape, and believes the wand will thereafter serve him and be unbeatable, but during his final duel with Harry his Killing Curse rebounds and he dies \u2013 as Harry had warned him \u2013 since the Elder Wand will not allow itself to be used by him against its true master.\n\nAfter Voldemort's death, Harry uses the Elder Wand to repair his own broken holly and phoenix-feather wand, which he says he was \"happier with\", and says he'll return the Elder Wand to Dumbledore's grave, feeling that if he dies peacefully, its superior power will end. In the film, Harry snaps the wand in two and throws the pieces off a bridge.\n\nRon stated that the Elder Wand would be the Hallow he would choose, simply because it is the \"unbeatable wand\", arguing that it was only dangerous to the brother who requested it because he kept on talking about his ownership of it and encouraging people to fight him.  Hermione (who said she would choose the Cloak) is skeptical, reminding him that the Wand, by its very nature, would make its possessor overconfident and braggadocious.   Rowling revealed in an interview that the first working title for ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'' was ''Harry Potter and the Elder Wand''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hpana.com/news.20137.html |title=News: Transcript of JK Rowling web chat |publisher=Hpana.com |date=2007-07-30 |accessdate=2017-03-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Resurrection Stone ===\nThe Resurrection Stone allows the holder to bring back deceased loved ones, in a semi-physical form, and communicate with them. The form of Sirius Black generated by the stone tells Harry that he and the other forms created by the stone are part of him and invisible to others. This seems to suggest that these apparitions are conjured from memories and are not really resurrected people. According to the fairy tale concerning the origin of the Deathly Hallows, using the Resurrection Stone drove the owner to kill himself because he brought his late fianc\u00e9e back from the dead, and she was very unhappy in the real world for she did not belong there. By the time the stone was seen in [[Marvolo Gaunt]]'s possession, it had been set into a [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Marvolo Gaunt's Ring|ring]] that bore the symbol of the Deathly Hallows, which the ignorant Gaunt believed to be the Peverell [[coat of arms]]; he used the ring to boast about his ancestry and blood purity. Both Dumbledore and Grindelwald desired the stone, but for different reasons. While Dumbledore wanted it to communicate with his dead family, Grindelwald allegedly intended to use it to create an army of [[zombie]]-like [[Inferius|Inferi]]. Harry said this is the Hallow he would desire most, as like Dumbledore he could name people he would like to communicate with again. Voldemort became aware of the ring's antiquity and eventually used the stone as a Horcrux, a container for part of his [[soul]], being unaware of its additional magical properties.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nDumbledore recovered the ring from Marvolo's estate, recognizing it as both a Horcrux and one of the Deathly Hallows. Forgetting that as a Horcrux, it was likely to be protected by curses laid by Voldemort, and blinded by personal desire, Dumbledore attempted to use the Resurrection Stone to talk to his deceased family. The curse destroyed his hand and began to spread throughout his body. Though the spread was partly contained in the destroyed and blackened hand by Snape, Dumbledore was doomed, having, at most, a year left to live. In their Kings Cross encounter, Dumbledore told Harry that this proved he had learned nothing from his past mistakes and ambitions for using the Hallows, and was part of the reason for his fear that Harry might also become obsessed with their power if told of them.\n\nThe stone was later passed to Harry through Dumbledore's will, hidden inside the [[Golden Snitch]] Harry caught with his mouth, nearly swallowing it, in his first-ever [[Quidditch]] match. The Snitch revealed the message \"I open at the close\" when touched by Harry's lips. Harry is unable to open the Snitch until he is about to die in the Forest, and realizes then \"the close\" means the end, or his death. Harry uses the Stone to summon his deceased loved ones \u2013 his parents, his godfather [[Sirius Black]], and [[Remus Lupin]] \u2013 to comfort him and strengthen his courage, before he goes to meet his death at Voldemort's hand. The stone falls unseen from Harry's numb fingers in the [[Hogwarts#Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]] as he reaches Voldemort's encampment. Harry survives the encounter and he and Dumbledore's portrait later agreed that Harry will neither search for it nor tell others where it is. In a 2007 interview, Rowling said she would like to believe a [[centaur]]'s hoof pushed it into the ground, burying it forever.<ref name=\"webchat\" />\n\n=== Cloak of Invisibility ===\n[[File:Cloak of Invisibility.jpg|thumb|Invisibility cloak]]\n{{See also|#Invisibility Cloak|l1=Invisibility Cloaks}}{{anchor|Harry's Cloak of Invisibility}}\nAccording to the legend, the Cloak of Invisibility has the power to shield the wearer from being seen by Death. It was the Hallow belonging to the youngest brother, who did not trust Death and took the cloak to hide from him, only giving it up when he was old and ready for death. It is owned by Harry throughout the series, although only later does he discover its significance and origin.\n\nUnlike other invisibility cloaks known to exist, this is uniquely a true [[#Invisibility Cloaks|invisibility cloak]], in that it is able to completely shield the wearer and others from sight and cannot be worn out by time or spells; other cloaks will lose their ability to conceal the wearer over time or become worn out, but the Hallow cloak will never fade or become damaged. At the end of ''Deathly Hallows'', Dumbledore explains to Harry the Cloak's true magic is it can shield and protect others as well as its owner. This is apparent when it does not respond to a Death Eater's Summoning Charm while concealing Harry, Ron and Hermione in ''Deathly Hallows''. Hermione claims that this is the Hallow she would choose, citing the usefulness Harry has found of it.\n\nThe cloak originally belonged to [[Supporting Harry Potter characters#The Peverell brothers|Ignotus Peverell]]. After his death, the cloak was passed down from father to son through Peverell's descendants, through his granddaughter, Iolanthe Peverell of Godric's Hollow, who married Hardwin Potter of the Gloucestershire Potters, all the way directly down to [[James Potter (character)|James Potter]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/1000-aol-chat.htm |title=J.K. Rowling Web Chat Transcript |date=30 July 2007 |accessdate=19 October 2007 |publisher=Accio Quote}}</ref> The Cloak was not in James' possession the night he was murdered; he had previously lent it to Dumbledore, who was greatly interested in the Deathly Hallows and suspected that the Potter family heirloom was more than it appeared. Dumbledore returned the Cloak to Harry a decade later as a Christmas present during his first year at Hogwarts. Harry uses the Cloak throughout the series in order to sneak around the school on various adventures. Harry's father also used the cloak for similar purposes. It is large enough for Ron and Hermione to accompany him as 1st years, and they frequently do, although this becomes increasingly difficult as they grow taller throughout the series.\n\nWhile making the wearer invisible to Muggles and wizards, some creatures are able to sense people hidden under it. Snakes, for example, cannot see through the Cloak of Invisibility, but they can somehow detect people under it. Mrs. Norris, [[Argus Filch|Filch]]'s cat, also seems to sense Harry when he wears the cloak. Wearers can also be detected by the \"Homenum Revelio\" spell.<ref name=\"webchat\" /> In ''Goblet of Fire'', Moody's magical eye can see Harry under the cloak. In ''Prisoner of Azkaban'', Dumbledore warns that the [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Dementors|Dementors']] perception of humans is unhindered by invisibility cloaks, as they are blind and sense people through emotions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomsbury.com/harrypotter/content.asp?sec=3&sec2=1 |title=Harry Potter at Bloomsbury |publisher=Bloomsbury.com |accessdate=25 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214064648/http://www.bloomsbury.com/harrypotter/content.asp?sec=3&sec2=1 |archivedate=14 February 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn the play ''[[Harry Potter and the Cursed Child]]'', Harry gifts the Invisibility Cloak to his eldest son James Potter, noting he'd \"been going on about the Invisibility Cloak since time itself\".  However, James' younger brother Albus (the protagonist of the play) steals the Cloak and uses it to evade bullies at Hogwarts.\n\n==Detectors==\n===Foe-glass===\nA Foe-glass is a mirror that detects and shows its owner's enemies in or out of focus, depending on how close they are. Moody, in reality [[Barty Crouch, Jr.]] in disguise, said that when the whites of their eyes are visible, he is in trouble. When Moody/Crouch was attacking Harry, Harry watched Professors Snape, McGonagall and Dumbledore approach the room in the mirror before they actually got there.  A Foe-glass is hanging in the Room of Requirement in ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'' when Harry uses the Room for D.A. meetings. Like all dark detectors, it can be fooled, as mentioned by Harry at the beginning of the first D.A. meeting.\n\n===The Marauder's Map===\n[[File:The Marauder's Map (opened).jpg|thumb]]\n{{anchor|Marauder's Map}}The Marauder's Map is a magical map of Hogwarts created by [[Remus Lupin]], [[Scabbers|Peter Pettigrew]], [[Sirius Black]], and [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)#James Potter|James Potter]] (respectively nicknamed \"Moony\", \"Wormtail\", \"Padfoot\", and \"Prongs\") while they were students at Hogwarts. During this time, they gained extensive knowledge about the school grounds, such as its various hidden passages, from their frequent night-time adventures together.\n\nIn ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', Fred and George Weasley give the map to Harry so he can travel to the village of Hogsmeade through a hidden passageway. The twins had previously stolen the map from a drawer in Filch's office that contained dangerous confiscated objects; it is revealed by Lupin that Filch probably knew what it was but not how to work it. [[Severus Snape|Snape]] later finds the map in Harry's possession and tries to force it to reveal its secrets, but the map merely mocks and insults him. Lupin (one of the creators of the map), the current [[Magic in Harry Potter|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher, is called upon to investigate this \"dark object\", and confiscates it to keep Harry safe, though he returns it to Harry after resigning his post at Hogwarts. From then on, the map becomes one of Harry's most useful tools in his ongoing adventures.\n\nAt first glance, the Map is simply a blank piece of parchment; but when the user points his wand at the Map and says, \"I solemnly swear that I am up to no good\", the message \"[[Mr.|Messrs]]. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs, purveyors of aids to magical mischief-makers, are proud to present the Marauder's Map,\" and a detailed layout of Hogwarts appears. Saying, \"Mischief managed!\" while pointing one's wand on the parchment returns the map to its original blank state. The map displays the location of everyone within the castle and its grounds, and includes the location of secret passageways and instructions on how to access them. Several locations like the Room of Requirement and the Chamber of Secrets do not appear on the map, either as the Marauders did not have any knowledge of them, or, in the case of the former, they are not a fixed location. Furthermore, Animagus disguises, [[Polyjuice Potion]], and [[#Invisibility Cloaks|Invisibility Cloaks]] cannot fool the map, as shown in ''Goblet of Fire'' when Barty Crouch, Jr., using a Polyjuice Potion to disguise himself as Moody,{{HP4}} and in ''Prisoner of Azkaban'' when Peter Pettigrew, who is supposed to be dead {{HP3}} but as an Animagus has transformed into a rat, are both displayed on the map.\n\nOn the prop version of the map made for the films, the lines are made up of what at first glance are just random letters, but upon closer inspection are [[Latin]] words. The series makes no mention of Harry recovering the map from Moody's office, even though he continued to use it in later books; when asked about this discrepancy, [[J. K. Rowling|Rowling]] answered that Harry had indeed sneaked into the office and recovered it in the days following the Third Task, and that she had forgotten to include this detail in the book. When asked during an online question session, \"What child did Harry give the Marauder's Map to, if any?\" (after his school years), [[J. K. Rowling|Rowling]] responded, \"I've got a feeling he didn't give it to any of them, but that [[James Sirius Potter|James]] (Harry's eldest son) sneaked it out of his father's desk one day.\"<ref name=\"webchat\"/> However, in ''Cursed Child'', Harry is shown to still possess the Marauder's Map and gives it to Professor McGonagall to keep an eye on his wayward son Albus Potter.\n\nIn [[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]], the fake professor Moody \u201cborrowed\u201d the map when Snape found the map. [[The Marauder's Map]] was first mentioned in [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]].\n\n===Probity Probe===\nA Probity Probe detects spells of concealment and hidden magical objects. The detector made its first appearance in ''Order of the Phoenix'' at the Ministry of Magic as a thin golden rod. After Voldemort's return, Probes are used as part of the increased security at [[Gringotts]] as well as for scanning the students of Hogwarts for Dark objects. They are last seen when Harry, Ron, and Hermione arrive at Gringotts in ''Deathly Hallows'' to rob Bellatrix Lestrange's vault of one of Voldemort's Horcruxes.\n\n===Remembrall===\n[[File:The Making of Harry Potter 29-05-2012 (Remembrall).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|]]\nA Remembrall is a small, clear orb, about the size of a large marble, containing smoke that turns red when it detects that the person holding it has forgotten something. It does not tell the holder what has been forgotten. The forgetful Neville Longbottom is sent a Remembrall by his grandmother in ''Philosopher's Stone.'' Remembralls are forbidden from being used during the O.W.L. exams.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix|last=Rowling|first=J.K.|publisher=Scholastic|year=2003|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=708\u2013709}}</ref>\n\n===Revealer===\nA Revealer is a bright red [[eraser]], used to make [[invisible ink]] appear. It made its first appearance in ''Chamber of Secrets'' when Hermione tried to make hidden writing appear in [[Tom Riddle's diary]].\n\n===Secrecy Sensor===\nThe Secrecy Sensor is a dark detector described as \"an object that looked something like an extra-squiggly, golden television aerial.\" It vibrates when it detects concealment and lies. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', Moody mentions that it is \"no use here, of course, too much interference \u2014 students in every direction lying about why they haven\u2019t done their homework.\" However, it may have been responding to Moody's own deception, as he was actually Barty Crouch Jr in disguise with a Polyjuice Potion.\n\nIn ''Order of the Phoenix'', Secrecy Sensors are used at the Atrium Desk in the [[Ministry of Magic]] upon visitors to the government locale. Later in the book, Harry mentions to [[Dumbledore's Army]] that they can be easily fooled like their other dark-detecting counterparts. In ''Half-Blood Prince'', due to Hogwarts' new stringent security measures, [[Argus Filch]] is assigned to inspect every student entering the castle with Secrecy Sensors. All the owls flying into Hogwarts are also placed under this measure to ensure that no Dark object enters the castle through mail. Hermione later explains that although Secrecy Sensors detect jinxes, curses, and Concealment Charms, they cannot detect love potions, as they are not considered Dark.\n\n===Sneakoscope===\nA Sneakoscope serves as a [[Dark Arts (Harry Potter)|Dark Arts]] detector. The device is described as a miniature glass-spinning top that emits shrill noises in the presence of deception, for instance, when an untrustworthy person is near or when a deceitful event takes place nearby.\n\nSneakoscopes are introduced in ''Prisoner of Azkaban'' when Harry receives a pocket-sized version from Ron for his 13th birthday. Bill says that Pocket Sneakoscopes are unreliable, as it lit up and spun at dinner for apparently no reason, but Fred and George had put beetles in his soup without his knowledge. The sneakoscope appears again on the [[Hogwarts Express]], and again in Harry and Ron's dormitory. Harry later discovers that Scabbers, Ron's rat, who is present each time the Sneakoscope is spinning, is actually [[Scabbers|Peter Pettigrew]] in [[Animagus]] form. In ''Goblet of Fire'', the somewhat paranoid Moody has several sneakoscopes that he somehow disabled (possibly related to a crack it was described as having), claiming, \"It wouldn't stop whistling\", keeping them in one of the seven compartments of his magical trunk.  Moody was later revealed to actually be Barty Crouch, Jr. under the effects of the Polyjuice Potion, thus explaining the constant alerts in his presence. Finally in ''Deathly Hallows'', Hermione gives Harry a Sneakoscope for his seventeenth birthday which they later use as a lookout while in hiding.\n\n===Weasley family clock===\n[[File:The Making of Harry Potter 29-05-2012 (7388833700).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|]]\nThe Weasleys have a special clock in their home, [[The Burrow (Harry Potter)|the Burrow]], with nine hands, one for every member of the family. Instead of telling the time, the clock reveals the location or status of each family member. The known locations are: ''Home'', ''School'', ''Work'', ''Travelling'', ''Lost'', ''Hospital'', ''Prison'', and ''Mortal Peril''. The Weasleys are the only family mentioned in the series to own such a clock. Dumbledore calls the clock \"excellent\" and seems impressed by it.<ref>Order of the Phoenix - Dumbledore: ''\"That will be a job for Fawkes when he has finished keeping a lookout for anybody approaching, but she may already know... that excellent clock of hers...\"''</ref>\n\nThe location ''Mortal Peril'' is situated where the numeral 12 would normally be. Throughout the first five books the hands change to reflect the varying statuses of the family members, but by the sixth book all nine hands point to ''mortal peril'' at all times, except when someone is travelling. Mrs. Weasley takes this to mean that with Voldemort's return, everyone is always in mortal peril, but she cannot verify this as she does not know anyone else who has a clock like hers.{{HP6}}\n\nVarious fans have re-created the clock for their own families, for example by using [[geofencing]] for cell phones.<ref>[http://elitedaily.com/envision/real-life-weasleys-clock-harry-potter/1387519/ This \u2018Harry Potter' Fan Made An Epic Real-Life Version Of The Weasley Clock]</ref><ref>[http://www.instructables.com/id/Weasley-Clock/ Weasley Clock in 9 Steps]</ref>\n\n==Games==\n===Exploding Snap===\nExploding Snap is a wizarding card game in which the cards spontaneously explode during games. The game is popular with Hogwarts students. In ''Chamber of Secrets'', Harry and Ron are held back from investigating why spiders were fleeing Hogwarts because [[Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]] delayed them with this game. Ron later singed his eyebrows while building a card house with Exploding Snap cards. In ''Order of the Phoenix'', [[Lee Jordan (Harry Potter)|Lee Jordan]] is punished by [[Dolores Umbridge]] for saying that she cannot tell them off for playing this game, as one of her Educational Decrees states that teachers can only talk to students about the subjects they are paid to teach. In ''Cursed Child'' Ginny remembers playing this game with Harry following the events of ''Chamber of Secrets'' and notes that it helped her to recover from the trauma (all the other students avoided her after learning the truth).\n\n===Gobstones===\nGobstones is one of the many magical games played by young wizards in the books, along with Wizard's Chess and Exploding Snap. Gobstones is similar to the Muggle games of [[marbles]] and [[p\u00e9tanque]], except that in Gobstones, the balls spit, or gob, a foul smelling liquid in the face of the opposing player when they lose a point. Hogwarts students are seen playing Gobstones throughout the books, and there is even a Gobstones Club at the school. It is also noted in the ''Harry Potter'' series that Eileen Prince (Snape's mother) was captain of Hogwarts' Gobstone Club, as a student, at age 15.\n\n===Quidditch balls===\nThe [[Quidditch]] balls consist of a Quaffle, a large red ball (and the only one not bewitched to fly on its own) which the Chasers need to get through the three hoops on the field, gaining ten points each time this successfully occurs; two Bludgers, which fly around attempting to disturb the game and knock people off their brooms, and which the Beaters hit away from teammates and towards the opposing team; and the Golden Snitch, a very fast and difficult-to-see golden orb the size of a walnut with wings, which the Seeker on each team must capture to finish the game and gain 150 points. The Quidditch players wear gloves, leg pads, padded head guards, and occasionally goggles.\n\n===Self-Shuffling Playing Cards===\nIn ''Chamber of Secrets'', a pack of Self-Shuffling Cards is mentioned as one of the various objects littering the floor of Ron's room in the Burrow.<ref name=\"CS3\">{{HPref|book=2|chapter=3}}</ref>\n\n===Wizard's Chess===\nWizard's Chess is played with pieces and a board identical to [[Chess]]. The rules are also unchanged. The pieces are magically animated, and they violently attack each other when performing a capture, by knocking the captured piece out and dragging it off the board.<ref>{{cite web | date = July 23, 2005 | author = Mark Weeks | url = http://chess.about.com/b/a/187742.htm | title = Elsewhere on the Web: Harry Potter Wizard Chess | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051022095438/http://chess.about.com/b/a/187742.htm | archivedate = 2005-10-22 }}</ref> The players order the pieces to move using [[algebraic chess notation]].\n[[File:HIMG 2759 (8066426928).jpg|thumb]]\nRon has a wizard's chess set left to him by his grandfather and Harry first plays with pieces borrowed from [[Seamus Finnigan]], which kept shouting him advice because they did not trust him.{{HP1}} Harry later gets a set of his own in one of his wizard crackers during his first Christmas at Hogwarts.\n\nDuring the climactic chapters of ''Philosopher's Stone'', Harry, Ron and Hermione become [[human chess]] pieces in a life-sized game of Wizard's Chess, which Harry wins thanks to Ron's advice and [[sacrifice (chess)|sacrifice]] as a piece. In the films, the chess pieces are depicted using replicas of [[Lewis Chessmen]].\n\n==Horcruxes==\nA Horcrux is an object used to store part of a person's soul, protecting him or her from death (a function similar to a Lich's [[Lich|phylactery]] from other fantasy works). If the body of a Horcrux owner is killed, that portion of the soul that had remained in the body does not pass on to the next world, but will rather exist in a non-corporeal form capable of being resurrected by another wizard, as stated in ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]]''. If all of someone's Horcruxes are destroyed, then the soul's only anchor in the material world would be the body, the destruction of which would then cause final death. The creation of Horcruxes is considered the darkest of all magic.\n\nThis method was chosen by Voldemort to attain [[immortality]]. The concept is introduced in ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince''. Rowling uses [[Horace Slughorn]]'s expository dialogue to reveal that the creation of a Horcrux requires one to commit a murder, which, as the supreme act of evil, \"rips the soul apart\".<ref>Rowling, J.K. (2005). ''Half-Blood Prince'' (in English). London: Bloomsbury Publishing, et al. p. 465. UK {{ISBN|0-7475-8108-8}}.</ref> After the murder, a spell is cast to infuse part of the ripped soul into an object, which then becomes a Horcrux. Rowling has never published the actual enchantment. In the final book of the series, Hermione finds the spell in a book titled ''Secrets of the Darkest Art''.<ref>Rowling, J.K. (2007). ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'' (in English). London: Bloomsbury Publishing, et al. p. 465. UK {{ISBN|0-7475-8108-8}}.</ref> Rowling has revealed that she intends to detail the process and spell used to create a Horcrux in her long-mentioned ''Harry Potter'' Encyclopedia.<ref>{{cite web|author=MuggleNet |url=http://www.mugglenet.com/books/futurebooks/encyclopedia/index.shtml |title=Mugglenet.com |publisher=Mugglenet.com |date=17 November 2004 |accessdate=25 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124042748/http://www.mugglenet.com/books/futurebooks/encyclopedia/index.shtml |archivedate=24 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nBoth inanimate objects and living organisms have been used as Horcruxes, though the latter are considered riskier to use, since a living being can move and think for itself. There is no limit to the number of Horcruxes a witch or wizard can create. As the creator's soul is divided into progressively smaller portions, they lose more of their natural humanity and the soul becomes increasingly unstable. Consequently, under very specific conditions, a soul fragment can be sealed within an object without the intention or knowledge of the creator. While the object thus affected will, like any Horcrux, preserve the immortality of the creator, it does not become a \"Dark object\".<ref name=\"pottercast166\" /> For example, Voldemort has unusual control over Nagini,<ref>Mentioned by Dumbledore to Harry in ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince''.</ref> and consequently Nagini is able to communicate with Voldemort about the presence of Harry in Godric's Hollow in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows''.\n\n<!--READ THIS BEFORE EDITING\nThis section is not the place to put specific means of destruction used in the books (Basilisk venom and Fiendfyre). Those details are given later in the article. This section is for general information.-->Horcruxes made from inanimate objects are extremely difficult to destroy. They cannot be destroyed by conventional means such as smashing, breaking, or burning. To be destroyed, a Horcrux must suffer damage so severe that repair through magical means would be impossible. Very few magical objects or spells are powerful enough to achieve this (mentioned and used were the Fiendfyre, Gryffindor's Sword and Basilisk fang, the last two only being able to inflict such damage due to the basilisk venom permeating them both). Once a Horcrux is irreparably damaged, the fragment of soul within it is destroyed. A Horcrux can be deliberately undone magically only if the creator goes through a process of deep remorse for the murder committed to create the Horcrux. The pain of this remorse can be so excruciating that the process may kill the creator.{{HP7}}\n\nVoldemort's creation of Horcruxes is central to the later storyline of the ''Harry Potter'' novels. As the number seven is a powerful number in magic, Voldemort intended to split his soul into that many pieces, with six Horcruxes and the last piece reposing within his body.<ref name=\"HBPp506\">Half-Blood Prince (US Scholastic Hardback edition), p. 506</ref> When Voldemort attacked the Potter family, and his body was destroyed by the rebounded Killing Curse, a piece of his soul splintered off and attached itself to the only living thing remaining in the room, Harry Potter, in a manner similar to a Horcrux.<ref name=\"pottercast166\">{{cite web|url=http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/12/23/transcript-of-part-1-of-pottercast-s-jk-rowling-interview |title=Transcript of Part 1 of PotterCast\u2019s JK Rowling Interview |publisher=The-Leaky-Cauldron.org |date=23 December 2007 |accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref> Later on, Voldemort went on to complete his collection of the intended six Horcruxes by turning his snake Nagini into one, thus fragmenting his soul into a total of eight (counting the one residing in his own body), not seven, pieces. By that time, though, unbeknownst to Voldemort himself, the diary had already been destroyed and, therefore, the seven Horcruxes never all existed together at the same point in time. \n\nAll of Voldemort's deliberately created Horcruxes were made using objects that had been important to him or that held some sentimental value. He hid some of them carefully so that no one could find and destroy them, but used Nagini to do his bidding on several occasions, and the diary was always intended to be a weapon to carry out Voldemort's plan to remove Muggle-borns from Hogwarts. Even without magical protection, Horcruxes cannot be destroyed by any means of wand usage or physical force. <!-- The lost diadem of Ravenclaw is destroyed by Fiendfyre in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows''. [Commented out dubious claim that this is an exception to the rules] --> In ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'', Harry intentionally destroys the diary with a Basilisk fang,<ref name=\"HBPp504\">Half-Blood Prince (US Scholastic Hardback edition), p. 504</ref> although unaware it was a Horcrux at the time, to free Ginny from its influence. In ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', the discovery of the diary is revealed as the proof that leads to Dumbledore beginning the hunt for other Horcruxes, as it not only gives absolute proof that Voldemort split his soul, but also that there were likely other, better protected artifacts, given the risk Voldemort was taking by using the diary as a weapon.\n\nRowling revealed on [[Pottermore]] that [[Quirinus Quirrell]] served as a temporary Horcrux when Voldemort's soul possessed his body during Harry's first year at Hogwarts. A notable difference, however, is that the piece of soul within Quirrell was able to exist without its container, as it abandoned Quirrell and left him to die in the underground chambers.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rowling|first1=J.K.|title=Professor Quirrell|url=https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/professor-quirrell|website=Pottermore|accessdate=7 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Tom Riddle's diary===\n[[File:Tom Riddle's Diary.jpg|thumb|upright|Tom Riddle's diary, with the basilisk fang that destroyed its horcrux]]\nTom Riddle created his first Horcrux during his fifth year at Hogwarts, using his own school diary. He cast the spell after murdering his fellow student [[Supporting Harry Potter characters#Moaning Myrtle|Myrtle Warren]] using the [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Basilisk|Basilisk]]. The diary is introduced in the thirteenth chapter of ''Chamber of Secrets'' and is destroyed by Harry Potter during the climax of the same book.\n\nBefore Voldemort's downfall, he entrusted the Horcrux to [[Lucius Malfoy]]. While aware of its corrupting magical properties, Malfoy did not know the diary was a Horcrux, Voldemort having informed him of its value as a weapon but believing that he would be in a position to coordinate Malfoy's use of it. In an attempt to discredit [[Arthur Weasley]] as well as dispose of an incriminating Dark object, Malfoy hid the diary in [[Ginny Weasley]]'s cauldron amidst her other books. Tom Riddle's soul-fragment possessed Ginny and, through her, reopened the [[Chamber of Secrets]], eventually starting to draw her life from her. At the end of book two, Harry saved Ginny and destroyed the diary by stabbing it with the venomous fang of a Basilisk, making it the first Horcrux to be destroyed. His reports of the diary's behavior to Dumbledore were the latter's first inkling that Voldemort might have created not just one Horcrux, but several: \"What intrigued and alarmed me most was that the diary had been intended as a weapon as much as a safeguard\",<ref>Rowling, ''Half-Blood Prince'' (Arthur A. Levine Books edition), pp.500</ref> implying that Voldemort must have had backups of some sort. It is also mentioned that Lucius was meant to wait for Voldemort's authorization before allowing the diary to be smuggled into Hogwarts, and that he never received it before Voldemort's first defeat. Voldemort did not learn of the diary's destruction until he forced the truth out of Lucius, and he became greatly enraged at the manner in which Lucius had so recklessly endangered it.\n\nTo Rowling, a diary is a very scary object, having said in an interview: \"The temptation particularly for a young girl, is to pour out her heart to a diary.\" Rowling's little sister Diane was prone to this, and her great fear was that someone would read her diary. This gave Rowling the idea to have a diary that is, in itself, against the confider.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hp-lexicon.org/thing/diary-of-tom-riddle/ |title=Diary of Tom Riddle \u2013 The Harry Potter Lexicon  |publisher=The Harry Potter Lexicon |accessdate=2017-03-01}}</ref> When asked what would have happened if Ginny had died and Riddle had managed to escape, Rowling revealed that \"it would have strengthened the present-day Voldemort considerably.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=17 | title = In 'Chamber of Secrets', what would have happened if Ginny had died and Tom Riddle had escaped the diary |publisher=J.K.Rowling Official Site | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060316221413/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=17 | archivedate = 16 March 2006 | website = jkrowling.com | accessdate = 25 December 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Marvolo Gaunt's Ring===\n[[File:Marvolo Gaunt's ring with Resurrection Stone.jpg|thumb|Marvolo Gaunt's ring with the Resurrection Stone]]\nTom Riddle created his second Horcrux using a ring owned by his maternal grandfather, [[Marvolo Gaunt]], during the summer before his sixth year as a student at [[Hogwarts]], when he was fifteen years old. The murder that created the Horcrux was that of his father. The ring is introduced during the fourth chapter of ''Half-Blood Prince'', having already been destroyed by [[Albus Dumbledore]].\n\nIn a [[Pensieve]] memory, it is revealed that Riddle had taken the gold ring, which has a black stone inscribed with a magical symbol, from his uncle [[Morfin Gaunt]], whom he had framed for the murder of his Muggle father and grandparents by altering his uncle's memories. Riddle wears the ring while still a student at Hogwarts, but eventually hides it in the house where the Gaunt family had lived. It remains hidden under the floorboards, placed in a golden box and protected by several enchantments, until Dumbledore finds it during the summer break between the events of ''Order of the Phoenix'' and ''Half-Blood Prince''. Dumbledore destroys the second Horcrux with [[Gryffindor Sword|Godric Gryffindor's sword]], but, as revealed in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', he also recognizes the stone in the ring as the [[Resurrection Stone]], one of the three [[Deathly Hallows (object)|Deathly Hallows]].  The Resurrection Stone was the Hallow Dumbledore most desired, hoping to assuage his guilt for his part in the death of his sister, Ariana.  Though afterwards, he recognizes it as totally unwise, Dumbledore, forgetting it was also a Horcrux and thus likely to be protected by destructive enchantments, hoping to activate it and apologise to his long-dead family, places the ring on his hand. He is mortally injured by the ring's curses. The injury leaves his right hand permanently disfigured and would have killed him quickly if not for the intervention of Snape who slowed the curse to Dumbledore's withered right hand and arm, but could not stop it from eventually killing him, had it run its course.<ref>Rowling, ''Deathly Hallows'' (Arthur A. Levine Books edition), pp.680\u2013683</ref> The damaged ring is kept for a time on a table in the Headmaster's office.\n\nBefore his death, Dumbledore hides the ring's black stone inside a [[Golden Snitch]] and he bequeaths the Snitch to Harry in his will.  Voldemort remained unaware of the stone's additional magical properties throughout his lifetime, Dumbledore noting that Voldemort's fear of death and lack of loved ones would have given him no reason to be interested in the Stone for its original purpose, and doubting that Marvolo would have been remotely interested in or aware of the Stone's true history.\n\n===Helga Hufflepuff's Cup===\n[[File:Helga Hufflepuff's cup.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Helga Hufflepuff's cup]]\nTom Riddle created his third Horcrux using [[Helga Hufflepuff|Helga Hufflepuff's]] cup. The cup is introduced during the twentieth chapter of ''Half-Blood Prince'' and is destroyed by Hermione Granger in the thirty-first chapter of ''Deathly Hallows''.\n\n[[Hepzibah Smith]], who owned the cup, was a distant descendant of Helga Hufflepuff. Riddle killed Smith by poisoning her, stole the cup, then framed her house elf [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Hokey|Hokey]] for the crime. Voldemort entrusted the cup to [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], who kept it protected in her vault at [[Gringotts Bank]], a place to which Harry guessed a once penniless Voldemort would have always coveted a connection. Additional protective spells, including Gemino (multiply curse) and Flagrante (fire curse), were used to protect the contents of the vault. Harry, Ron and Hermione, with Hermione disguised as Bellatrix, broke into the bank and stole the cup. Hermione later destroyed the Horcrux using a fang from the remains of the [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Basilisk|Basilisk]] still in the [[Chamber of Secrets]].\n\n{{-}}\n===Salazar Slytherin's Locket===\n[[File:Salazar Slytherin's Locket (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Salazar Slytherin's locket]]\nRiddle created his fourth Horcrux using his own ancestor [[Salazar Slytherin|Salazar Slytherin's]] [[locket]], which had once belonged to Riddle's mother, [[Merope Gaunt]]. The spell was cast after Riddle murdered a Muggle tramp.<ref name=\"RowlingWeb2007\">{{cite news|url=http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/7/30/j-k-rowling-web-chat-transcript|title=J.K. Rowling Web Chat Transcript|date=30 July 2007|publisher=[[The Leaky Cauldron (website)|The Leaky Cauldron]]|accessdate=30 July 2007}}</ref> The locket is introduced briefly in the sixth chapter of ''Order of the Phoenix'' (described only as \"a heavy locket that not one of them could open\") and is destroyed by Ron Weasley in the nineteenth chapter of ''Deathly Hallows''.\n\nSlytherin's locket was passed down through the generations and eventually ended up in the possession of Merope Gaunt. After being abandoned by her husband [[Riddle family|Tom Riddle Sr.]], Merope sold the locket to Caractacus Burke, shopkeeper of [[Knockturn Alley|Borgin & Burkes]], for 10 Galleons, a small fraction of the locket's true value. The locket was eventually sold to Hepzibah Smith. Riddle stole the locket, along with Helga Hufflepuff's cup, after murdering Smith. Once the locket became a Horcrux, Voldemort hid it in a seaside cave where he had once terrorised two of his fellow orphans. The cave's magical protection included a door that could only be opened with a blood offering, an enchanted boat, a basin of potion that causes pain and horrific visions to the drinker, and the use of [[Inferius|Inferi]]. Dumbledore and Harry Potter pursued the locket in ''The Half-Blood Prince'' only to find a fake one at the bottom of the basin.\n\nDisillusioned Death Eater [[Regulus Black]] had learned about the Horcrux and its hiding place from his house elf [[Kreacher]], whom he had originally volunteered to accompany Voldemort to hide the Horcrux. In an effort to bring about Voldemort's eventual downfall, he and Kreacher navigated the magical protection and stole the locket, replacing it with the false one to fool Voldemort. While Black died in the effort, killed by the surrounding Inferi, Kreacher took the locket back to their home at [[Number 12 Grimmauld Place|Number 12, Grimmauld Place]]. Unable to destroy it like Black ordered, Kreacher continued to protect the locket for years. While the [[Order of the Phoenix (organisation)|Order of the Phoenix]] was using the house as its headquarters, the locket was stolen by [[Order of the Phoenix (organisation)#Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus Fletcher]], a petty criminal and member of the Order. He gave it to [[Dolores Umbridge]] as a bribe when she caught him selling stolen property.\n\nTwo weeks after learning these details, Harry, Ron, and Hermione infiltrated the [[Ministry of Magic]], where Umbridge worked, and stole the locket. Ron later saved Harry from being strangled by it when he wore it around his neck while attempting to retrieve the sword of [[Godric Gryffindor]] from the bottom of a lake in the [[Forest of Dean]]. When Ron attempted to destroy the locket, the fragment of soul inside assumed the shape of Harry and Hermione and played on Ron's fear that his two friends had started a romantic relationship during his absence. Briefly at this point, Ron's eyes gleamed scarlet, like Voldemort's. Ron destroyed the locket using the sword of Gryffindor in the same forest.\n\n{{-}}\n\n===Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem===\n[[File:Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem.jpg|thumb|Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem]]\nTom Riddle created his fifth Horcrux using [[Rowena Ravenclaw|Rowena Ravenclaw's]] [[diadem]]. The diadem is introduced briefly in the twenty-fourth chapter of ''Half-Blood Prince'' (described as \"a tarnished tiara\" in the Room of Requirement), but was later introduced by name and destroyed by Vincent Crabbe in the thirty-first chapter of ''Deathly Hallows''.\n\nRavenclaw's daughter, Helena, stole the diadem from her mother in an attempt to become more intelligent than her mother. She fled to [[Albania]], where she hid the diadem in the hollow of a tree when the Bloody Baron searched for her. After Helena was murdered by the Bloody Baron, she became the Ravenclaw [[Hogwarts ghosts|house ghost]] and Tom Riddle, while a student at the school, charmed her into telling him the location of the diadem. Shortly after leaving Hogwarts and after the murder of Hepzibah Smith, he traveled to Albania and seized the artifact.<ref name=\"Deathly Hallows (Amazon)\">{{cite book|first=J. K.|last = Rowling|title=Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows|publisher=Bloomsbury; Children's edition (21 July 2007)|isbn=0-7475-9105-9|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0747591059}}</ref> Voldemort murdered an Albanian peasant to turn the diadem into a Horcrux.<ref name=\"RowlingWeb2007\"/> Years later, when Voldemort returned to Hogwarts, reapplying for the Defence Against the Dark Arts position but denied the job by Albus Dumbledore, he hid the diadem in the Room of Requirement. Because Voldemort believed himself to be the only one to have discovered the Room, he never placed any curses around the diadem.<ref name=\"Deathly Hallows (Amazon)\"/>\n\nIn ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', Harry first comes into contact with the diadem when he hastily hides Snape's old potions book in the Room of Requirement. The diadem was mentioned merely as an \"old discoloured tiara\" in the sixth book; Harry used it to help mark the spot so he could later find where he placed the book. Later, after having the diadem described to him by the Ravenclaw ghost, Harry recalls this scene and hurries to retrieve it from the Room.<ref name=\"Deathly Hallows (Amazon)\"/> The diadem was unintentionally destroyed by a Fiendfyre curse cast by [[Supporting Harry Potter characters#Crabbe and Goyle|Vincent Crabbe]] as he, [[Gregory Goyle]], and Draco Malfoy attacked Harry, Ron, and Hermione inside the Room.<ref name=\"Deathly Hallows (Amazon)\"/> In the film version, Harry stabs the diadem with another basilisk fang and Ron kicks it into the Room of Requirement, as the Fiendfyre reaches the door.\n\n===Nagini===\n{{Main|Nagini (Harry Potter)}}\nThe sixth Horcrux was Nagini, the snake Voldemort had with him constantly. This Horcrux was created by Voldemort when he was hiding in the forests of Albania; the murder victim whom he used for its creation was Bertha Jorkins. He found Nagini, and becoming smitten by the snake, turned it into a Horcrux, being connected with it.<ref name=\"RowlingWeb2007\" /> In the last chapter of ''Deathly Hallows'', Nagini was killed by Neville Longbottom using the sword of Godric Gryffindor. The destruction of the last remaining Horcrux made Voldemort mortal.\n\n===Harry Potter===\n{{main|Harry Potter (character)}}\nWhen Voldemort attempted to murder Harry, he inadvertently sealed a fragment of his soul within him in a manner similar to a Horcrux. The event took place just before the opening chapter of ''Philosopher's Stone''. Rowling has explicitly stated that Harry never became a proper \"Dark object\" since the Horcrux spell was not cast.<ref name=\"pottercast166\" /> Regardless, as with all Horcruxes, Voldemort would remain immortal so long as his soul fragment remained within Harry.<ref>Rowling, J.K. (2007). ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'' (in English). New York City: Scholastic, et al. pp. 686. \"And while that fragment of soul, unmissed by Voldemort, remains attached to and protected by Harry, Lord Voldemort cannot die.\"</ref> That portion of Voldemort's soul is unintentionally destroyed by Voldemort himself at the close of the thirty-fourth chapter of ''Deathly Hallows'' with the help of the Elder Wand.\n\nAs a baby, Harry was in the room when Voldemort's fatal Killing Curse backfired. Voldemort's soul had been weakened and destabilised by his continuous murders and the creation of his previous Horcruxes. Harry became a Horcrux when a fragment of Voldemort's soul attached itself to him after the unsuccessful curse. The lightning bolt-shaped scar on Harry's forehead is a direct result of this attempted murder, and the connection that formed as a result is used to explain several important plot points. Throughout the series, Harry is able to receive insight into Voldemort's mental and emotional states, allowing the reader to [[Eavesdropping|eavesdrop]] on the series' primary antagonist. This insight is usually accompanied by pain in the scar on Harry's forehead. Through Voldemort, Harry also inherited the ability to speak and understand [[Magic (Harry Potter)#Parseltongue|Parseltongue]]. It is also revealed by Rowling in an interview that Harry's frequent pain in his scar when Voldemort is either active, nearby, or feeling strong emotions, is really the trapped bit of soul yearning to depart from Harry's body and rejoin its master's soul.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080917115036/http://pottercast.the-leaky-cauldron.org/transcript/show/166?ordernum=2 PotterCast 130: The One with JK Rowling Transcript Part 2 (16:09 - 32:17) (Archived copy; original  website no longer valid)] ''web.archive.org copy of pottercast.the-leaky-cauldron.org'', accessed 29 March 2020</ref>\n\nThis yearning was one of the reasons why the Killing Curse used by Voldemort on Harry in the [[Hogwarts#Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]] does destroy the fragment of Voldemort's soul within Harry, but only sends Harry's soul into a near-death state. Harry could return to his body despite being hit by the Killing Curse from the Elder Wand because Voldemort had used Harry's blood to regain his full strength in ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', and because the actual master of the Elder Wand, Draco Malfoy, had been defeated by Harry making Harry the new master of the Elder Wand. Harry's ownership of the wand used for the curse and the Horcrux-like connection between Voldemort and Harry diminished Voldemort's curse and protected Harry from irreversible death.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows|last=Rowling|first=Joanne Kathleen|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing, plc.|date=21 July 2007|isbn=0-545-01022-5|location=United Kingdom|pages=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/harrypotterdeath00rowl}}</ref>\n\nWhile Voldemort did learn of Harry's [[Telepathy|telepathic]] connection, Voldemort was never aware that Harry was inadvertently carrying a fragment of his soul. With this destroyed, the connections between the two were also broken, and Harry never again felt pain in his scar. Rowling revealed Harry has also lost the ability to speak Parseltongue, though he regained the ability to understand it in ''[[Harry Potter and the Cursed Child]]'' after his scar began to hurt again following the rise of Voldemort and Bellatrix's daughter Delphi whom Harry, his son Albus Severus, and his allies defeated and sent to Azkaban.<ref name=\"RowlingWeb2007\" /> In the epilogue of the film, the scar has faded to an ordinary looking scar on Harry's forehead.\n\n==Legendary magical artifacts==\n[[File:Goblet of Fire (Harry Potter movies).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.5|]]\n===Goblet of Fire===\nThe Goblet of Fire is a [[goblet]] made of wood and is used at the beginning of every [[Triwizard Tournament]]. It is used solely to choose the participating school champions, serving as an \"impartial judge.\"{{HP4}} Slips of parchment with the names of potential candidates are placed in the Goblet and, at the designated time, a representative from each school is chosen when the slip of parchment containing their name spouts forth from the Goblet in a fountain of magical fire. The fake Moody stated once that the Goblet of Fire was \"an exceptionally powerful magical object\" and it is very difficult to hoodwink, unless someone uses an exceptionally strong Confundus Charm.\n\nDuring its use in ''Goblet of Fire'', it is placed in the entrance hall and surrounded by an \"Age Line\", a charm placed by Dumbledore to prevent underage wizards from entering the tournament. Anyone underage would grow a long white beard, as the Weasley twins demonstrated when they attempted to fool the goblet with an Ageing Potion. When not in use, the Goblet is kept in a jeweled casket in Dumbledore's closet.\n\n===Godric Gryffindor's Sword===\n[[File:The Making of Harry Potter 29-05-2012 (Sword of Gryffindor).jpg|thumb]]\n<!-- [[Godric Gryffindor's Sword]], [[Godric Gryffindor's sword]], [[Gryffindor Sword]], [[Gryffindor's Sword]], [[Gryffindor's sword]], [[Sword of Godric Gryffindor]], and [[Sword of Gryffindor]], all redirect here -->\nThe Sword of Godric Gryffindor is a [[Goblin (Harry Potter)|goblin]]-made sword adorned with large rubies on the [[Pommel (sword)|pommel]]. It was once owned by [[Godric Gryffindor]], one of the medieval founders of [[Hogwarts]]. In ''Chamber of Secrets'', Harry draws the Sword out of the [[#Sorting Hat|Sorting Hat]] to battle and kill a [[Basilisk (Harry Potter)|Basilisk]]. When Dumbledore learns of Harry's concern that he does not belong in the House of Gryffindor, in part at being [[parseltongue]] like [[Lord Voldemort]], the headmaster is able to put the boy's concerns at ease by telling him only a true member of that house could have summoned that sword in his time of need. The sword also plays a key role in ''Deathly Hallows'', where it is revealed to have become imbued with Basilisk venom following its use against the Basilisk, as it \"only takes in that which makes it stronger\". It is subsequently used to destroy three of Voldemort's Horcruxes.\n\nBecause the Sword was goblin-forged, it is indestructible, and according to [[Griphook]] the goblin, the Sword was originally forged by the goblin Ragnuk the First and \"stolen\" by Gryffindor, as The Sword was taken by Griphook when the Sword fell from Harry's grasp during the raid on [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]'s vault in book seven. The sword returned to wizard hands, when Neville pulled it out of the Sorting Hat and used it to decapitate Nagini, Voldemort's snake. This shows that no matter where the sword happened to be at the time, it will reappear in the Hat when a true member of Gryffindor house is in need of it.<!-- Dumbledore makes it clear in ''Chamber of Secrets'' that only a true Gryffindor can summon the sword in this fashion. [See Above] -->\n\nRowling has confirmed <!-- in her webchat --> that Gryffindor did not steal the sword from Ragnuk and that this belief is merely part of Griphook's goblin mistrust and prejudice against wizards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2007/0730-bloomsbury-chat.html |title=Gryffindor did not 'steal' the sword, not unless you are a goblin fanatic and believe that all goblin-made objects really belong to the maker |publisher=Accio-quote.org |date=30 July 2007 |accessdate=25 November 2011}}</ref> <!-- It was revealed on Pottermore [Reference at end of paragraph] --> Godric Gryffindor commissioned Ragnuk the First to make the sword for him under his specifications. Once Ragnuk had made the sword, he was so fond of it that after he had presented it to Gryffindor, he told the goblins it had been stolen and sent minions to retrieve it for him. Gryffindor defeated the goblins using magic and instead of killing them, he bewitched them to go back to Ragnuk and say that if he tried to take the sword again, he would use it against them. The king took the threat seriously, but still insisted it had been stolen from him until the day he died.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pottermore.com/en/book2/chapter18/moment1/the-sword-of-gryffindor |title=Sword of Gryffindor |publisher=Pottermore |date=October 2012 |accessdate=5 January 2013}} {{Registration required}}</ref>\n\nIt is mentioned in the ''Deathly Hallows'' that the Sword of Gryffindor is supposed to be in Bellatrix Lestrange's vault, placed there by Severus Snape. Unknown to Bellatrix, that sword was only a replica.{{clarify|date=December 2014}}<!-- is it fake? this same paragraph makes it clear that Griphook lies --> When Harry, Ron and Hermione were captured and brought to the Malfoy Manor, she spotted the sword near one of the Snatchers, who intended to keep it. She killed him and forced the rest out of the room, then tortured Hermione for information about the sword. But at Harry's request, Griphook lied and said that the sword was a forgery. Bellatrix's reaction to having her vault possibly broken into convinced Harry that the Horcrux was also placed in her vault.\n\n===Philosopher's Stone===\n[[File:The Making of Harry Potter 29-05-2012 (Philosopher's stone).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|]]\nBased upon the ancient alchemical idea of the [[Philosopher's stone]], the stone is owned by [[Nicolas Flamel#In popular culture|Nicolas Flamel]] and first mentioned in ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]''. The stone is legendary in that it changes all metals to gold, and can be used to brew a potion called the [[Elixir of Life]], making the drinker immortal. The Philosopher's Stone is seen only in the first and last book, although it is referenced several times throughout the series. It was destroyed at the end of the first book by Dumbledore with Flamel's agreement.\n\nIn the American version, this stone is called the Sorcerer's Stone.\n\n===Sorting Hat===\n[[File:Wizarding World of Harry Potter - the sorting hat (5013545663).jpg|left|thumb|The Sorting Hat as seen on the queue for the theme park attraction, [[Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey]].]]\nThe Sorting Hat is a [[Sapience|sapient]] [[artifact (fantasy)|artefact]] used at Hogwarts, which uses Legilimency (essentially, the ability to read minds) to determine which of the four school houses \u2013 [[Gryffindor]], [[Hufflepuff]], [[Ravenclaw]] or [[Slytherin]] \u2013 each new student is to be assigned for their years at Hogwarts. The hat resembles a dilapidated conical leather wide-brimmed wizard's hat, with folds and tears that make it appear to have eyes and a mouth. During the opening banquet at the beginning of each school year, the Hat is placed on every first-year student's head. The Hat announces its choice aloud, and the student joins the selected house. The Hat speaks to the student while they're being sorted and is willing to take the student's preferences into account when it makes its decision. Sometimes it does not have the need to do so: for instance, the Hat barely touched Draco Malfoy's head before sending him to Slytherin. The Sorting Hat had a difficult time placing Harry, almost placing him into Slytherin house before he requested specifically and emphatically not to be. The Hat instead placed him into Gryffindor, the house of his parents. Rowling has stated the reason for the Hat's indecision as to which house to place him into was because it sensed the part of Voldemort's soul within Harry.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}<!-- if \"Rowling stated\" then that statement should be sourced -->\n\nThe Sorting Hat originally belonged to Godric Gryffindor, one of the four founders of Hogwarts. The four founders used to hand-pick the students for their houses, but then realised someone else would have to do it after they died, so Gryffindor took off his hat, enchanted it, and let it choose.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/the-sorting-hat|title=The Sorting Hat {{!}} Wizarding World|website=www.wizardingworld.com|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> Since then, the Sorting Hat has always been used to choose which house the students are put in. Due to its age, it appears \"patched and frayed and extremely dirty.\" Before Sorting the students each year, the hat recites a new introductory song. These songs occasionally warn of danger to come, as in ''Order of the Phoenix''. The Sorting Hat's songs vary in length and content, but always include a brief description of each house.\n\nThe Sorting Hat has shown the ability to conjure the Sword of Gryffindor from under its brim, as shown on two instances. Both times it is used to kill snakes; in ''Chamber of Secrets'', it provides the sword to Harry to kill the Basilisk, and in ''Deathly Hallows'', it delivers the sword to Neville. Dumbledore makes it clear in ''Chamber of Secrets'' that only a true Gryffindor can summon the sword in this fashion. In ''Deathly Hallows'' the Sorting Hat is set on fire by Voldemort, although it appears the hat was not destroyed, as Neville was able to draw the Sword of Gryffindor from it immediately after and behead Voldemort's snake Nagini. In the epilogue at the end of ''Deathly Hallows'', the Hat's survival is confirmed, as Harry tells his youngest son that the Hat would take his preference into consideration.\n\nAccording to Pottermore, a Hatstall is 'an archaic Hogwarts term for any new student whose Sorting takes longer than five minutes. This is an exceptionally long time for the Sorting Hat to deliberate, and occurs rarely, perhaps once every 50 years. Of Harry Potter's contemporaries, Hermione Granger and Neville Longbottom came closest to being Hatstalls. The Sorting Hat spent nearly four minutes trying to decide whether it should place Hermione in Ravenclaw or Gryffindor. In Neville's case, the Hat was determined to place him in Gryffindor: Neville, intimidated by that house's reputation for bravery, requested a placing in Hufflepuff. Their silent wrangling resulted in triumph for the Hat.'<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rowling|first1=J.K.|title=Hatstall|url=https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/hatstall|website=Pottermore|accessdate=7 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nRowling has stated on Pottermore that 'The Sorting Hat is notorious for refusing to admit it has made a mistake in its sorting of a student. On those occasions when Slytherins behave altruistically or selflessly, when Ravenclaws flunk all their exams, when Hufflepuffs prove lazy yet academically gifted and when Gryffindors exhibit cowardice, the Hat steadfastly backs its original decision. On balance, however, the Hat has made remarkably few errors of judgement over the many centuries it has been at work.'<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/the-sorting-hat |title=The Sorting Hat |publisher=Pottermore |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2016-12-28}}</ref>\n\nIn the ''Harry Potter'' films, the Sorting Hat is voiced by actor [[Leslie Phillips]].<!-- in the first, second, and eighth films, no other actors http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0001041/ -->\n\n==Mirrors==\n===The Mirror of Erised===\n[[File:Mirror of Erised (28731124264).jpg|thumb]]\nThe Mirror of Erised is a mystical mirror discovered by Harry in an abandoned classroom in ''<!--do not change to \"Sorcerer's\"-->Philosopher's<!--do not change to \"Sorcerer's\"--> Stone''. On it is inscribed \"erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi\". When mirrored and correctly spaced, this reads \"I show not your face but your heart's desire.\" As \"erised\" reversed is \"desire,\" it is the \"Mirror of Desire.\" Harry, upon encountering the Mirror, can see his parents, as well as what appears to be a crowd of relatives; Ron sees himself as Head Boy and Quidditch Captain holding the House Cup, thus revealing his wish to escape from the shadow of his highly successful older brothers, as well as his more popular friend, Harry. Dumbledore cautions Harry that the Mirror gives neither knowledge nor truth, merely showing the viewer's deepest desire, and that men have wasted their lives away before it, entranced by what they see.\n\nDumbledore, one of the few other characters to face the Mirror in the novel, claims to see himself holding a pair of socks he always wanted, telling Harry that \"one can never have enough socks,\" and lamenting that he did not receive any for Christmas, since people will insist on giving him books. However, Harry suspects that this is not true, and it is suggested in ''Deathly Hallows'' that what he really sees is his entire family alive, well and happy together again, much like Harry.<ref>{{cite web|author=Melissa |url=http://the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/7/30/j-k-rowling-web-chat-transcript |title=J.K.

Dumbledore hid the Mirror and hid the Stone inside it, knowing that only a person who wanted to find but not use the Stone would be able to obtain it. Anyone else would see him or herself making an Elixir of Life or turning things to gold, rather than actually finding the Stone, and would be unable to obtain it. What happens to the mirror afterwards is unknown.\n\n===Two-way mirrors===\nIn ''Order of the Phoenix'', Sirius gives Harry a mirror he originally used to communicate with James while they were in separate detentions. That mirror is a part of a set of ''Two-way Mirrors'' that are activated by holding one of them and saying the name of the other possessor, causing his or her face to appear on the caller's mirror and vice versa. Harry receives this mirror from Sirius in a package after spending his Christmas holiday at [[Grimmauld Place]]. Harry, at first, chooses not to open the package, although he does discover the mirror after Sirius' death, by which point it is no longer functional. It makes its second appearance in ''Deathly Hallows'' when [[Mundungus Fletcher]] loots Grimmauld Place and sells Sirius' mirror to [[Aberforth Dumbledore]], who uses it to watch out for Harry in ''Deathly Hallows''. When Harry desperately cries for help to a shard of the magical mirror (which broke in the bottom of his trunk), a brilliant blue eye belonging to Aberforth (which Harry mistakes for Albus' eye), appears and he sends [[Dobby the house elf|Dobby]], who arrives to help Harry escape from [[Malfoy Manor]] to [[Shell Cottage]].\n\n==Prank objects==\n===Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes===\n{{Main|Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes}}\nPrank objects from Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes are made and designed by the owners of the shop, Fred and George, who test their new creations on themselves and other Hogwarts students.\n* Weasley's Wild-fire Whiz-Bangs are enchanted fireworks that have overly spectacular and remarkable effects.\n* Skiving Snackboxes are sweets that are designed to make the eater temporarily ill in order to skip or \"skive off\" class. Each variety of Snackboxes causes a different effect, such as vomiting, fainting or developing nosebleeds. One end of the sweet causes the malady, while the other end subsequently cures it. The snackboxes include: Nosebleed Nougat, Fever Fudge, Fainting Fancies, Blood Blisterpods and Puking Pastilles.\n* Patented Daydream Charms are kits that put the user into a realistic 30-minute daydream which they imagine, and can easily be customised so as to be fitted into any lesson.\n* A Headless Hat creates a limited field of invisibility that covers the wearer's head, giving him or her the appearance of not having a head. Its counterpart is a Shield Hat, which deflects minor hexes and curses. Though Fred and George design the Shield Hat to be a trick item, Ministry officials are impressed by its practical value and order 500 of them for protection of the Aurors. Shield Cloaks and Shield Gloves are also on sale following the Shield Hat's success.\n* Trick Wands are magical fake wands that turn into a silly item (rubber chickens, tin parrots, etc.) when someone tries to use them. More expensive varieties beat the unwary user about the head and neck.\n* Ton-Tongue Toffees make the eater's tongue temporarily grow to an alarmingly large size, as read about in ''Goblet of Fire'' when Fred \"accidentally\" drops some in front of Dudley, who subsequently eats one they \"forgot\" to retrieve.\n* Canary Creams make the eater turn briefly into a large [[Domestic Canary|canary]]; when the effect wears off, the person molts and returns to normal.\n* U-No-Poo causes the consumer to have constipation, or as Fred and George refer to it: \"The constipation sensation that's gripping the nation.\" Its name is a play on \"You-Know-Who\", commonly used to refer to Voldemort.\n* Extendable Ears are long flesh-coloured strings, one end of which is inserted into a user's ear and the other end placed further away towards a conversation or sound. Much like a listening device, the user will be able to hear the sounds as if they were much closer to the source. They were first introduced by Fred and George Weasley in ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', when they used the ears to listen to the Order's meetings, until one was destroyed (and eaten) by Crookshanks.\n* Portable Swamps are, as the name suggests, realistic pop-up swamps. They were first seen in ''Order of the Phoenix'' after Umbridge is renamed Headmistress. Fred and George set one off in a corridor, partly as a distraction for Umbridge so Harry can use her fireplace, and partly to just cause general mayhem. They seem to be reasonably difficult to remove: Umbridge cannot remove it and forces Filch to punt students across, while Professor Flitwick vanishes it almost instantly later on in the novel. (He leaves a small patch untouched as a tribute to Fred and George, who have left Hogwarts by this point.)\n* Decoy Detonators are described as black horn type objects that will run out of sight, and make a noise giving the user a good distraction. Introduced in ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]''. First used by Harry while breaking into Dolores Umbridge's office at the Ministry of Magic in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]''.\n*Guaranteed Ten-Second Pimple Vanisher\n*Pygmy Puffs (miniature Puffskeins)\n*Edible Dark Marks\n\nThere are also prank items which the Weasleys import from elsewhere, such as:\n\n*Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder, which throws an area into darkness that cannot be penetrated by wandlight or any magical means, although the effect wears off in a few minutes. Draco Malfoy uses it to avoid members of Dumbledore's Army in ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]]''. It is also used in the ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Half-Blood Prince]]'' film by Harry in order to gain access to the luggage space above Draco Malfoy's table on the [[Hogwarts Express]].\n\n===Zonko's Joke Shop===\n[[Zonko's|Zonko's Joke Shop]] was a favorite place for Hogwarts students to shop on Hogsmeade trips. It carried \"jokes and tricks to fulfill even Fred and George's wildest dreams.\" Such products include Hiccough (Hiccup) Sweets, Frog Spawn Soap, and Nose-Biting Teacups. Fred and George tried to buy the place to expand their shop in Hogsmeade during Harry's sixth year, but they turned it down due to the dark times coming up.\n\n===Other prank objects===\nOther prank objects include Belch Powder,<ref name=\"PA8\">{{HPref|book=3|chapter=8}}</ref> Dungbombs (which explode and cause a large and extremely smelly mess), and Ever-Bashing Boomerangs (which hit their target repeatedly after being thrown). Fanged Frisbees are quite literally normal Frisbees with fangs and are first mentioned in ''Goblet of Fire'' as one of Filch's newest restricted items during Dumbledore's start-of-term speech. However, they make their first appearance in ''Half-Blood Prince'' when Ron whirled one around the Gryffindor common room, it changed course with a mind of its own, and took a bite out of a tapestry. Most of these objects are banned at Hogwarts due to the possibility of injury.\n\nMore objects include Screaming Yo-Yos, which scream very loudly when worked, and Stink Pellets, which are used to distract prefects and teachers, and give a most unpleasant smell.<ref name=\"PA8\"/>\n\n==Storage receptacles==\n===Hermione's handbag===\nIn ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', Hermione used an Undetectable Extension Charm on her beaded handbag, significantly enlarging the bag's internal dimensions without affecting its physical size. As well, the [[mass]] of the objects placed in her handbag is negated, making the bag easy to carry. Bags similar to this appear in other contexts, such as the \"[[bag of holding]]\" in Dungeons and Dragons or the \"[[magic satchel]]\" in many other games. [[Mary Poppins]] also seems to have a handbag of similar uses. Hermione uses it to carry everything they need when they travel across the United Kingdom on their hunt for Horcruxes.\n\n===Mokeskin pouch===\nMokeskin pouches are a type of draw-string pouch that can be operated only by the owner. Harry receives one as his 17th birthday present from Hagrid, using it to store several items of personal significance, such as the Golden Snitch, his broken wand, the false locket, the shard of Sirius' mirror and the Marauders' map.\n\n===Moody's Magical Trunk===\n[[File:The Making of Harry Potter 29-05-2012 (7386427778).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|]]\n[[Alastor Moody]] owns a strangely bewitched magical trunk. It has seven locks on it, and the trunk opens to a different assortment of objects for each lock. Most notably, though, the seventh compartment is about {{convert|10|ft|m|0}} deep (possibly because of the use of an Undetectable Extension Charm), and is where Barty Crouch Jr. imprisoned the real Moody. Other compartments contain spellbooks, Dark Detectors, and Moody's Invisibility Cloak.\n\n===Pensieve===\n[[Image:The Making of Harry Potter 29-05-2012 (7375511988).jpg|thumb|]] A Pensieve is a stone basin used to review memories. Covered in mystic runes, it contains memories whose physical form is neither gas nor liquid. A witch or wizard can extract their own or another's memories, store them in the Pensieve, and review them later. It also relieves the mind when it becomes cluttered with information. Anyone can examine the memories in the Pensieve, which also allows viewers to fully immerse themselves in the memories stored within, much like a magical form of [[virtual reality]].\n\nUsers of these devices view the memories from a [[Third-person narrative|third-person-point-of-view]], providing a near-[[omniscient]] perspective of the events preserved. Rowling confirmed memories in the Pensieve allow one to view details of things that happened even if they did not notice or remember them, and stated \"that's the magic of the Pensieve, what brings it alive.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mugglenet.com/jkrinterview3.shtml |title=MuggleNet Emerson and Melissa's J.K. Rowling Interview Page 3 |publisher=Mugglenet.com |date=16 July 2005 |accessdate=25 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110122257/http://www.mugglenet.com/jkrinterview3.shtml |archivedate=10 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The memories contained in the Pensieve have the appearance of silver threads. Memories that have deteriorated due to age, or that were heavily manipulated or tampered with to alter perspectives (such as Slughorn's), may appear thick and jelly-like and offer obscured viewing. Memories are not limited to just those of humans, since [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Hokey|Hokey]] the house-elf provided Dumbledore with a memory as well. It makes its last appearance in ''Deathly Hallows'' when Harry uses it to uncover the truth about Snape.\n\nIn [[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|the fourth film]], the Pensieve in Dumbledore's office conforms to the description given in the novel. However, in [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|the sixth]] and [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2|eighth films]], it appears as a shallow metal dish, floating in midair and filled with a [[mercury (element)|mercury]]-like liquid. During the eighth film, Harry removes it from the stone basin so he can use it to examine Snape's memories.\n\n==Transportation==\n===Arthur Weasley's Magic Ford Anglia===\n[[File:Harry Potter car.jpg|thumb]]\n[[Arthur Weasley]] owned a 1960 [[Ford Anglia|Ford Anglia 105E]] that he subsequently enchanted; consequently, the [[flying car (fiction)|vehicle can fly]], become invisible, and carry the entire Weasley family in spite of its formerly non-enchanted interior dimensions (also the Undetectable Extension Charm), among other abilities. In ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'', the car is borrowed by Fred, George and Ron, who use it to rescue Harry from the Dursleys' house. Ron and Harry later steal the car in order to return to Hogwarts after the gate to [[Platform 9\u00be]] is sealed by Dobby. After they arrive at school, landing in the Whomping Willow, the car ejects Harry, Ron, and their luggage, then flees into the [[Hogwarts#Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]], ignoring Ron's pleas for it to come back. Mr Weasley soon faces an [[inquiry]] at the Ministry of Magic, as seven [[Muggle]]s saw the car flying across the countryside, and is forced to pay a large fine.\n\nThe car reappears when Harry and Ron visit [[Aragog]] in the forest: when the great spider's colony of acromantula attempt to devour Harry and Ron, the car attacks the spiders and carries the boys to safety. The car does not return to the Weasleys despite saving Ron and Harry, instead re-entering the forest to remain on its own. The car's current condition is undisclosed; Ron had commented that the enchanted vehicle had become \"wild\" and thus operated autonomously, like a wild animal. In theory, it might still exist when the characters' children attend Hogwarts.\n\nThe 1962 Ford Anglia used in the film was acquired by [[Rupert Grint]], who plays Ron Weasley, and is currently displayed in the [[National Motor Museum, Beaulieu]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.beaulieu.co.uk/attractions/on-screen-cars |title=On Screen Cars &#124; Beaulieu, New Forest |publisher=Beaulieu.co.uk |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2017-03-01}}</ref> A total of 14 Ford Anglias were destroyed during the filming of the scene where the car crashes into the Whomping Willow.\n\nA replica of the car in its feral state can be seen in the queue line for the [[Dragon Challenge]] roller coaster at the [[Islands of Adventure|Universal Studios Islands of Adventure]] theme park. Occasionally it blinks its headlights and honks its horn when its motion detectors sense that guests are standing in front of it or walking by it.\n\n===Floo Powder===\n[[Image:Floopowder.jpg|thumb|left|Floo Powder as seen in [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]]' film adaptation of ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]''.]]\nFloo Powder is a glittering powder used by wizards to travel and communicate using fireplaces. It was invented by Ignatia Wildsmith (1227\u20131320) and named after the [[flue]], which is the passageway that leads from a fireplace to the chimney and allows hot gases to escape.\n\nFloo powder can be used with any fireplace connected to the Floo Network. To transport from one to another, the fire at the point of departure must first be lit. The traveler throws a handful of Floo powder into the flames, turning them emerald green, then steps into the fireplace and states the intended destination in a clear and purposeful voice. Floo powder can also be used for communication; a wizard or witch can kneel in front of the fireplace and stick their head into the fire, which will then appear in the fire of the destination fireplace, leaving the witch or wizard free to talk. It is also known that other body parts may be transported via Floo Powder, as Umbridge almost catches Sirius the second time he converses with Harry through the Floo network. Voices can also be transmitted through the Floo Network, as seen in the ''Prisoner of Azkaban'' by Snape, who summons Lupin through his office's fireplace while interrogating Harry about the Marauder's Map.\n\nIn ''Chamber of Secrets'', the Weasleys travel to [[Diagon Alley]] using Floo Powder. Harry did not say \"Diagon Alley\" clearly enough due to coughing in the fire's smoke and ashes, so he was sent to Borgin and Burkes in [[Knockturn Alley]]. In the fourth book, Mr. Weasley uses his position at the Ministry to have the Dursleys' fireplace temporarily connected to the Floo Network, unaware that it had been blocked up. Sirius uses the network to communicate with Harry in the same book. In the fifth book, Harry uses the Gryffindor fireplace and later Umbridge's fireplace to communicate with Sirius; he is forced to use the latter because Umbridge begins monitoring all other lines of communication in and out of Hogwarts.\n\nThe Floo Network is controlled by the Ministry of Magic. The Ministry also has over 700 fireplaces in its headquarters so that officials and workers can go directly to/from work without the hustle and bustle of travelling on brooms or by Portkey - or the indignity of having to flush themselves in through a public toilet, as portrayed in ''Deathly Hallows''.\n\nAccording to [[Pottermore]], the only licensed producer of Floo Powder in Britain is Floo-Pow, a company whose Headquarters is located in Diagon Alley. No shortage of Floo Powder has ever been reported, nor does anybody know anyone who makes it. Its price has remained constant for one hundred years: two Sickles a scoop.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rowling|first1=J.K.|title=Floo Powder|url=https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/floo-powder|website=Pottermore|accessdate=7 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Flying carpets===\nFlying carpets are rugs, that are enchanted with the ability to fly. Flying Carpets were once an accepted form of travel for the British magical community, but they are banned due to being defined as a Muggle Artefact<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/artifact |title=Dictionary.reference.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |accessdate=25 November 2011}}</ref> by the Registry of Proscribed Charmable Objects. It is therefore against British wizarding law to charm carpets or fly them, although they are still legal in other countries. Mr. Weasley was heavily involved in the introduction of this legislation due to his position in the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts office. It is revealed that the ban was relatively recent, not only due to Mr. Weasley's involvement, but also because Barty Crouch's grandfather owned and operated a 12-seater [[Axminster carpet|Axminster]] before flying carpets were prohibited.\n\n===Hogwarts Express===\n{{Main|Hogwarts Express}}\nThe Hogwarts Express is the train which transports Hogwarts students to and from the school at the beginning and end of each term. It also transports willing students home for the Christmas holidays. It is stationed in Hogsmeade when not in use, and it can be accessed only by using [[Platform 9 3/4|the magical wall between the platforms 9 and 10]].\n\n===Knight Bus===\n[[File:The Knight Bus, Wizarding World of Harry Potter, Universal Studios Orlando, 12 October 2014.jpg|thumb|300px|The Knight Bus, seen in the [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'' film]], at [[Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden]].]]\nThe Knight Bus is a heavily enchanted purple [[triple-decker]] Regent Three class bus that transports witches and wizards. It is hailed just like in hitchhiking, but instead of the thumb, the wizard has to hold his wand hand out to hail the Knight Bus. It makes its first appearance in ''Prisoner of Azkaban'' when Harry unintentionally hails it by throwing out his wand arm to break his fall after a stumble. Harry has a final ride on the Knight Bus with a number of his friends in ''Order of the Phoenix''. The Knight Bus is faster than travelling by broomstick, but not as fast as near instantaneous [[#Floo Powder|Floo Powder]] and [[Apparating]]. The bus charges for the service based on distance; Harry is charged a base fare of 11 Sickles to travel from [[Little Whinging]] to [[The Leaky Cauldron (pub)|The Leaky Cauldron]]. Amenities such as hot-water bottles, toothbrushes, and hot chocolate are available for a small additional fee.{{HP3}}\n\nThe bus functions as a convenient form of public transportation for the wizard or witch who cannot or will not choose another means of transportation. The riders are seemingly picked up by the bus from all over in-universe Great Britain, bringing passengers to the destinations of their choice with seemingly no set route. It bolts through the streets entirely invisible to Muggles and causes other objects to dodge it (instead of the other way around) for short distance-travel. For longer distances, the Knight Bus makes hundred-mile (160&nbsp;km) leaps, accompanied by a great bang and jolt. The interior of the bus changes depending on the time of day, having seats by day and beds by night. It is also highly uncomfortable, according to Ron and Harry. Its only mentioned limitation in travelling is that it is unable to voyage through water.\n\nThe [[Conductor (transportation)|conductor]] of the Knight Bus is [[Stan Shunpike]], and its driver is Ernie Prang. In the third film, Ernie is accompanied by a talking [[shrunken head]] [[voice actor|voiced]] by [[Lenny Henry]].\n\nAs revealed on [[Pottermore]], the Knight Bus was first commissioned in 1865 as a method for underage or infirm wizards to transport themselves discreetly. The idea was proposed by then-Minister of Magic Dugald McPhail, after a number of other ideas such as broomsticks with sidecars were vetoed, taking inspiration from the then-relatively-new bus service.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rowling|first1=J.K.|title=The Knight Bus|url=https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/the-knight-bus|website=Pottermore|accessdate=7 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe actual Knight Bus seen in the film adaptation was built by grafting the top deck of a London [[AEC Regent III RT]] bus onto the top of another \"RT\" bus. Both buses were originally built for [[History of public transport authorities in London|London Transport]]; the \"RT\" was the standard London diesel-powered double-decker bus of which approximately 4,000 were built from 1939 until the mid-1950s (and were used in daily service until 1979). The actual bus used was RT3882 (registration LLU681), with the additional top deck from former RT2240 (registration KGU169). Parts of RT 4497 (OLD 717) were also used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countrybus.org/RT/RT4_4.htm |title=Countrybus.org |publisher=Countrybus.org |accessdate=25 November 2011}}</ref> A replica of the Knight Bus sits in front of the London facade at [[The Wizarding World of Harry Potter (Universal Orlando Resort)|The Wizarding World of Harry Potter]] in [[Universal Studios Florida]], serving as a stage for a small audience-interactive show with a Stan Shunpike look-alike and a shrunken head.\n\n===Portkeys===\nPortkeys are first mentioned in ''Goblet of Fire'' by Mr. Weasley. They are an alternative to Apparation but can also be used to transport a group of people at once. Created by using the Portus spell, a Portkey can be set to transport anybody who touches it to a designated location or to become active at a predetermined time and transport itself and anyone touching to its set destination.<ref name=\"HP4-p69\"/> It may be created for one-way, one-time use or to transport the holder to and from a particular place in a round trip; in addition, it may be set to activate at a particular time or automatically transport the first person who touches it. The creation of Portkeys is highly restricted and controlled by the Department of Magical Transport, Portkey office. Cornelius Fudge objects to Dumbledore spontaneously creating one, stating that Dumbledore hasn't got authorisation; and at one point in chapter 3, Lupin says, \"...&nbsp;it's more than our life's worth to set up an unauthorised Portkey.\"<ref>{{HP5}}, \"The Advance Guard\", p. 51{{clarify|date=March 2020}}</ref>\n\nAny object can be used as a Portkey; it is common practise to select old, worthless items, to discourage unsuspecting Muggles from picking them up and activating them.<ref>{{HP4}}, \"The Portkey\", p.66{{clarify|date=March 2020}}</ref> Portkey objects used in the Potter series include a football and an old Wellington [boot]. Once the Portus charm is cast upon an object, it glows blue and vibrates gently; once settled it has become a Portkey. When Portkeys are activated, users feel the sensation of a hook being jerked from behind their navel. The floor disappears from beneath their feet, leaving their last position behind them, and they fly forward through a whirlwind of colour and sound, appearing suddenly at their destination.<ref name=\"HP4-p69\">{{HP4}}, \"The Portkey\", p.69{{clarify|date=March 2020}}</ref> With enough practice it is possible to achieve a graceful landing: After the Portkey trip to the [[Quidditch World Cup]] in the fourth film, Mr. Weasley, [[Cedric Diggory|Cedric]] and [[Amos Diggory]] land on their feet, while the less experienced teenagers, including Harry, fall on the ground.\n\nA Portkey plays an important role in the climax of ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]''. At the end of the Triwizard Tournament, the Triwizard Cup is revealed to have been turned into a Portkey by Barty Crouch Junior and it transports Harry Potter and Cedric Diggory to a graveyard where Cedric is killed and Voldemort regains physical form. Prompted by his parents, Harry later uses the Portkey to escape with Cedric's body back to Hogwarts.\n\n===Sirius Black's Enchanted Motorbike===\n[[File:The Making of Harry Potter 29-05-2012 (7386852396).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|]]\n[[Sirius Black]] owned a flying motorbike, which he lent to Hagrid the night Harry's parents died. It is first seen when Hagrid delivers the baby Harry to Number 4, Privet Drive in the first book, and then again when Hagrid uses it to transport Harry to a safe house in the seventh volume. In ''Deathly Hallows'', various modifications have been made to the bike by Mr. Weasley, allowing it to create a brick wall or a net that erupts from the exhaust pipe and to shoot dragon fire from the exhaust, impelling the bike's sudden acceleration. The dragon-fire feature is used to great effect by Hagrid and Harry when being chased by Voldemort; however, Mr. Weasley did warn that he was unsure of its safety and that they should use it only in an emergency. He was right to say this, as the sidecar of the motorbike, unaffected by Hagrid's magic dislodged after the abrupt acceleration.\n\nThe bike is severely damaged when, with Hagrid and Harry aboard, it crashes into [[Ted Tonks|Ted]] and [[Andromeda Tonks]]' garden pond. Mr. Weasley covertly tells Harry that he plans to put the bike back together when \"he has time\", meaning when Mrs. Weasley is distracted or has forgotten about it. He hides it in the chicken coop and manages to repair it, giving it to Harry between the end of ''Deathly Hallows'' and the epilogue. The bike is now still in Harry's possession, but he doesn't use it.\n\n===Time-Turners===\n[[File:Giratemps.jpg|thumb]]\nA Time-Turner may be used for short-term [[time travel]]. Hermione receives a Time-Turner from McGonagall in ''Prisoner of Azkaban'', enabling her to attend more than one class simultaneously. Hermione is ordered to keep it a secret from everyone, including Harry and Ron, although they do notice the suspicious impossibility of her schedule and several bizarre disappearances and reappearances. Hermione lets Harry and Ron in on the secret near the end of the book, when she and Harry use the Time-Turner to save [[Sirius Black]] and [[Buckbeak]]. Feeling the strain from her heavy course load, she finally returns the device to McGonagall at the end of the novel. In the film version, however, only McGonagall, Dumbledore and Harry knew of Hermione's possession of her time-turner, as Ron witnessed Harry and Hermione repeatedly travelling back in time in the infirmary, but seeing them back together moments later near the end of the film.\n\nA large supply of Time-Turners is kept at the Ministry, as seen in ''Order of the Phoenix''; however, during the events of that book, a glass-fronted cabinet containing the Time-Turners is destroyed. Due to their time-affecting properties, the cabinet is seen to fall, shatter and repair itself repeatedly. In ''Half-Blood Prince'', Hermione quotes an article in ''[[The Daily Prophet]]'' which stated that \"the entire stock of Ministry Time-Turners\" was destroyed during that incident. The books do not discuss who else may be in possession of Time-Turners outside of the Ministry. Time-Turners are very dangerous when in the wrong hands, as it's said that many wizards met their demise after confronting and accidentally killing their own selves from the future so they are issued very carefully.\n\nHermione's Time-Turner resembles a gold [[hourglass]] pendant on a necklace; it is unclear if all of them do. The user twists the hourglass pendant, with the number of twists corresponding to the number of hours of back travel required.<ref name=\"PA21\">{{HPref|book=3|chapter=21}}</ref>\n\nTime-Turners are a significant point device in ''Cursed Child'', where it is revealed that a principle known as Croaker's Law restricts all legal Time-Turners to travelling a maximum of five hours into the past (any longer would create ripple effects that would harm either the time traveller or time itself) \u2013 although it is widely rumoured that Draco Malfoy's son Scorpius is the son of Lord Voldemort and that Scorpius' mother used a Time-Turner to make this possible.  An illegal Time-Turner capable of travelling back years is confiscated from a Dark wizard by the Ministry of Magic (although official word remains that all Time-Turners are destroyed) and is later stolen by Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy, who intend to travel back in time to prevent the death of Cedric Diggory.  Unfortunately, they quickly discover the Time-Turner is a cheaply made prototype that only takes them back for five minutes before forcibly returning them to the present. After accidentally creating (and then undoing) an [[Alternate history|alternate reality]] where Voldemort survived and took over the world, Albus and Scorpius resolve to destroy the Time-Turner, but are forced into another time trip by the story's villain and are left trapped in the past when the Time-Turner is destroyed.  Back in the present, Draco reveals he possesses a professionally made Time-Turner (bound by neither Croaker's Law nor the five-minute flaw) - he never admitted its existence for fear it would lend credence to the rumours surrounding his son and never used it (despite being tempted by the possibility of seeing his dead wife alive again).  When Albus and Scorpius are able to send a message to their parents, Draco's Time-Turner is used to rescue the boys.\n\n===Vanishing Cabinet===\nThe Vanishing Cabinet is a cabinet located in the [[Room of Requirement]] at Hogwarts that is a part of a set of two. The other cabinet resides in [[Borgin and Burkes]]. If used properly, a person who steps into one of the cabinets will instantly emerge from the other.\n\nThe Vanishing Cabinet is first seen in ''Chamber of Secrets'' when Harry hides in it to elude the Malfoys after accidentally traveling to Borgin and Burkes via the Floo Network; its transportation features are not activated as he does not shut the Cabinet completely. Its Hogwarts counterpart is also mentioned in ''Chamber of Secrets'' when [[Nearly Headless Nick]] persuades [[Peeves]] the Poltergeist to drop it (thus breaking it) over Filch's office in order to help Harry escape detention for tracking in [[mud]]. It was also used in ''Order of the Phoenix'' by Fred and George when they forced Montague, the [[Slytherin]] Quidditch captain and member of the Inquisitorial Squad, into it when he tried to take house points from Gryffindor. Draco then learns of Montague's experience, discovering transportation is possible between the two Cabinets and the other is located in Borgin and Burkes. In ''Half-Blood Prince'' he manages to fix the broken one at Hogwarts so as to transport the Death Eaters into the highly secured castle.\n\nThough this set is the only one mentioned in the book series, the film version of ''Half-Blood Prince'' reveals that they were popular when Voldemort first came to power, as they would allow people to make a quick getaway from Voldemort and his Death Eaters in an emergency.\n\n==Writing equipment==\n===Anti-Cheating Quill===\nThe Anti-Cheating Quill, a quill with an anti-cheating charm on it, first mentioned in ''Philosopher's Stone''.{{PStone|16}} In book five they are assigned to every O.W.L. student \u2013 and presumably those taking other exams \u2013 in order to prevent students from cheating in their written exams.\n\n===Auto-Answer Quill===\nThe Auto-Answer Quill is a quill that has been bewitched so that when the quill touches a question on a piece of parchment it writes the answer instantly. The quill is banned from the O.W.L. Examinations and the inks are checked out every time the test is on.{{OotP|31}}\n\n===Blood Quill===\nThe Blood Quill is a torture quill used by Umbridge throughout the ''Order of the Phoenix'' to punish students that she has given detention. It is described as having an unusually sharp black nib. As the user writes, the quill magically and very painfully cuts into the back of the user's hand and uses his or her blood for ink. In the fifth book, Harry has detention with Umbridge on several occasions; he is required to write lines (''I must not tell lies'') and is not released from this until Umbridge believes \"the message has sunk in.\" When carried out repeatedly over an extended period, this leads to permanent scarring, as Harry shows Scrimgeour in the last two books. The scars tingle whenever Harry hears Umbridge's name, but it is not clear whether this is psychological or akin to Harry's forehead scar hurting whenever Voldemort is active. Another victim of this form of detention is Lee Jordan; in the film adaptation of the book, members of [[Dumbledore's Army]] are forced to use these quills as well. Blood quills are considered illegal to own.\n\n===The Quill of Acceptance===\nAccording to [[Pottermore]], the Quill of Acceptance is a magical object which detects the birth of a child with magical capabilities. It is located in Hogwarts School, where it records the children's names in a large book. Professor McGonagall consults the book and sends out the subsequent Hogwarts acceptance letters by owl once the child turns eleven. It has been made very popular due to its use in registering users for the closed beta of Pottermore.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/the-quill-of-acceptance-and-the-book-of-admittance |title=The Quill of Acceptance and The Book of Admittance |publisher=Pottermore |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2016-12-28}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=June 2017}}\n\n===Quick Quotes Quill===\nA Quick Quotes Quill is a stenographic tool, acid green in colour, employed by Rita Skeeter to spin the words of her subjects into a more salacious or melodramatic form. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', Skeeter uses the quill to interview Harry about his participation in the Triwizard Tournament for her column in ''The Daily Prophet''. Harry continually tries to alert her to the inaccuracy of the quill; however, she continually ignores him. Additionally, in ''Deathly Hallows'', Rita mentions in her ''Daily Prophet'' interview concerning her posthumous biography of Dumbledore that her Quick Quotes Quill helped her to write the book so quickly after his death.\n\n===Spell-Checking Quill===\nThe Spell-Checking Quill temporarily corrects spelling as the user writes; however, once the charm wears off it constantly misspells words, even if the user writes them correctly. The most notable example is its misspelling of Ron's name as \"Roonil Wazlib\" in ''Half-Blood Prince''. It is sold through Weasley's Wizard Wheezes, the joke shop opened by Fred and George Weasley.\n\n==Other uncategorised objects==\nThese objects remain uncategorised as they are the only ones in their field.\n\n===Cauldron===\n[[File:The Making of Harry Potter 29-05-2012 (7528757868).jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|]]\n[[Cauldrons]] are magical receptacles in which [[Potions in Harry Potter|potions]] are brewed. They can be bought at the [[Places in Harry Potter#Cauldron Shop|Cauldron Shop]] in Diagon Alley. There are many different sizes and materials for cauldrons; Hogwarts asks students to buy a simple pewter size 2 cauldron, though in the first book Harry expresses a longing for one of pure gold.\n\nIn ''Goblet of Fire'', [[Percy Weasley]] writes a report on cauldrons for his new Ministry job in the hope that it will push regulation of the thickness of cauldron bottoms, as he believes foreign imports are a safety risk.\n\n===Gubraithian fire===\nGubraithian Fire is an everlasting magical fire that may only be created by extremely skilled wizards. Hagrid and [[Madame Maxime]] gave a bundle of Gubraithian fire, conjured by Dumbledore, as a gift to the Gurg (leader) of the [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Giants|giants]] during their attempts to sway them to Dumbledore's side.{{HP5}}\n\n===Omnioculars===\nOmnioculars are a pair of magical brass [[binoculars]] used by Harry, Ron and Hermione in the fourth book during the Quidditch World Cup. Omnioculars, besides having the magnification capabilities of binoculars, have many other useful features. For example, they have the ability to slow down or replay something seen through the lenses, although a side effect is that the view in the lenses is not current and can lead to confusion as to the state of the match. They also have a play-by-play feature, where the names of moves performed by Quidditch players is shown in bright purple letters across the Omnioculars' lenses.{{HP4}} Omnioculars also have the ability to list the names and numbers of the players, and can zero in on players rapidly.\n\n===Spellotape===\nSpellotape is magical [[adhesive tape]]. The name is a play on [[Sellotape]], a popular brand which has become a [[genericised trademark|generic name]] for transparent [[adhesive tape]] in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite book |last=Boyle |first=Fiona |title=A Muggle's Guide to the Wizarding World: Exploring The Harry Potter Universe |publisher=[[ECW Press]] |year=2004 |page=[https://archive.org/details/mugglesguidetowi0000boyl/page/363 363] |isbn=1-55022-655-X |url=https://archive.org/details/mugglesguidetowi0000boyl/page/363 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Whited |first=Lana A. |title=The Ivory Tower and Harry Potter: Perspectives on a Literary Phenomenon |publisher=[[University of Missouri Press]] |year=2002 |page=280 |isbn=0-8262-1549-1}}</ref> It is used by Ron in ''Chamber of Secrets'' to repair his wand after he breaks it while trying to halt Mr. Weasley's flying car. It is also used by Hermione in ''Prisoner of Azkaban'' when she binds her ''Care of Magical Creatures'' (the Monster Book of Monsters) textbook to prevent it from biting her, and by Kreacher to mend a photo of Bellatrix Lestrange later in the series. It is used by Ginny in ''Goblet of Fire'', who was mending her copy of the ''One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi'' textbook.\n\n===Wand===\n[[File:The Making of Harry Potter 29-05-2012 (7184365467).jpg|thumb]]\nA [[wand]] is a wooden stick-like object used to channel magical energy and thus increase its power, and without which only limited magic is possible. Wands are used as both tools and weapons in the [[wizarding world]]. They are thus an important aspect of nearly all magic, and great importance is placed on wand mastery. Wands are generally carried inside the wizard's robes or otherwise somewhere on their person; however, they can also be placed into other objects. For instance, Rubeus Hagrid hid the broken halves of his wand inside his umbrella, and in the film adaptations, Lucius Malfoy hides his wand in his cane. In the magical world, when a wizard is expelled from Hogwarts, their wands are snapped in half. This type of damage to a wand is nearly irreparable, though Harry is able to mend his wand, which was accidentally broken by Hermione, with the help of the powerful [[#Elder Wand|Elder Wand]].\n\nA wand is made by a wandmaker who is learned in wandlore, the study of wands. Wands are handcrafted from high-quality woods, or \"wandwoods\", which are capable of sustaining magic (e.g. holly, yew, ebony, vinewood, mahogany, cherry, oak, etc.). A core is then inserted into the middle of the wand from top to bottom, which gives it its power to generate magical effects. Common cores include [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] tail feathers, [[unicorn]] tail hairs, and [[dragon]] heartstrings. Veela hair is also used, but less commonly. In the ''Deathly Hallows'', the Elder Wand is described as the only wand with a core made from the tail hair of a [[Thestral]].<ref name=\"jkextra25\"/> The only wand shop seen in the books is [[Ollivanders]]. Garrick Ollivander is a wandmaker who has an [[eidetic memory]] concerning wands, as well as the ability to identify the distinguishing features of a wand. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', Ollivander is seen to evaluate two foreign wands: Viktor Krum's, whose wand was crafted by Gregorovitch, was unusually thick and had a dragon's heartstring core; Fleur Delacour's, created by an unknown wandmaker, was made of rosewood with a core of Veela hair. Ollivander believes Veela hair produces \"temperamental\" wands and does not use it.\n\nSalazar Slytherin's wand contained a fragment of a basilisk horn, which allowed Slytherin and other Parselmouths who possessed it to cast spells with it at a distance by speaking to it in Parseltongue. In the United States, wand cores are created from the horn of river serpents, [[Wampus cat|Wampus]] hair, Snallygaster heartstring and [[Jackalope]] antlers, a practice originated in the 17th century by the first American wandmaker, Isolt Sayre, an Irish immigrant who founded the Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in [[Massachusetts]], and the Slytherin wand's last owner. She buried it outside the school grounds, and within a year, an unknown species of snakewood tree grew from the burial spot. It resisted all attempts to prune or kill it, but after several years the leaves were found to contain powerful medicinal properties.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/ilvermorny |title=Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry |publisher=Pottermore |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2017-03-01}}</ref>\n\nA wand is generally considered a very personal object. Wands belonging to other [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizards]] can be borrowed, resulting in a comparatively less potent effect. In ''Philosopher's Stone'', Harry had to try out many wands before he found one that \"chose him.\" Wands with cores from the same source give strange effects (''[[Priori Incantatem]]'') when forced to fight each other, as is the case with Harry and Voldemort's wands. In ''Goblet of Fire'', it is revealed each of their wands contains a tail feather from [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Fawkes|Fawkes]], the phoenix belonging to Dumbledore. After ''Priori Incantatem'', the wands get to know the opposites' master, as explained in ''Deathly Hallows''. While, according to Ollivander, any object can channel magic if the wizard is strong enough, wands are the most commonly used because of their efficiency (due to the owner's bond with the wand itself). This can explain how some wizards are able to use spells without wands (for example, retrieving an item with ''Accio'').\n\nFurthermore, wands are able to be won from a witch or wizard and can therefore change their allegiance. This is the case when Harry takes Draco's wand at Malfoy Manor, and consequently the wand's allegiance swaps to Harry, as explained by Ollivander; and, by extension, so does the allegiance of the Elder Wand, which itself has changed hands many times.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n{{Harry Potter}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Magical Objects in Harry Potter}}\n[[Category:Harry Potter objects| ]]\n[[Category:Fictional garments]]\n[[Category:Magical objects|Harry Potter]]\n[[Category:Harry Potter lists]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Overly detailed|date=December 2016}}\n{{In-universe|date=August 2017}}\n{{More citations needed|date=January 2017}}\n{{Cleanup rewrite|date=March 2017}}\n}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2013}}\n{{Use British English|date=August 2011}}\nThe following is a list of [[Magic in fiction|magical objects]] used in the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series. \n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Magical objects in ''Harry Potter''}}\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Communication==\n===Enchanted coins===\nIn ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', [[Hermione Granger]] creates fake, enchanted Galleons ([[Wizard (fantasy)|Wizard]] money) or as they call it (enchanted coins) that are used for communication between members of [[Dumbledore's Army]] (the DA). Like real Galleons, the coins have numerals around the edge. On normal Galleons these serial numbers signify the goblin who cast the coin; on the enchanted Galleons, the numbers represent the time and date of the next D.A. meeting, and automatically change to match whatever numbers [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] sets on his coin.{{HP5}} Due to the coins being infused with a Protean Charm, once Harry Potter alters his, every coin changes to suit. The coins grow hot when the numbers change to alert the members to look at their coins.\n\nIn ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', [[Draco Malfoy]] uses a pair of enchanted coins to bypass the communication limits imposed on [[Hogwarts]], thus managing to keep in contact with [[Madam Rosmerta]], whom he had placed under the Imperius Curse. Draco reveals he got the idea from Hermione's DA (Dumbledore's army)  coins, which were themselves inspired by [[Lord Voldemort]]'s use of the [[Dark Mark]] to communicate with his [[Death Eater]]s.\n\nIn ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', [[Neville Longbottom]] uses the DA's (Dumbledore's army) coins to alert people such as [[Luna Lovegood]] and [[Ginny Weasley]] that Harry, Ron and Hermione have returned to Hogwarts. They then arrive at the [[Room of Requirement]] to fight in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] on May 2, 1998.\n\n===Howler===\n[[File:Howler (Harry Potter) - 2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|A Howler sent to Ron Weasley]]\nA Howler is a blood-red letter sent to signify extreme anger or to convey a message very loudly and publicly. When it is opened, the sender's voice, which has been magically magnified to a deafening volume, bellows a message at the recipient and then self-destructs itself by burning. If it is not opened or there is a delay in opening it, the letter smoulders, explodes violently, and shouts the message out even louder than normal.{{HP2}} In the film version, the Howler folds itself into an [[origami]]-style set of lips and teeth and shouts the message out, and then shreds itself into scraps of paper before it burns itself.\n\nIn ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'', [[Ron Weasley]] receives a Howler from his mother, [[Molly Weasley]], after he steals his father's [[Ford Anglia|enchanted car]] and flies it to Hogwarts with Harry. [[Neville Longbottom]] confesses that he had once gotten a Howler from his [[Augusta Longbottom|grandmother]], stating that he ignored it and that the result was horrible. Subsequently, Neville receives another Howler from his grandmother after [[Sirius Black]] uses his list of passwords to enter the [[Gryffindor]] Common Room in ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]''. Hermione receives one in ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'' after [[Rita Skeeter]] publishes an article about the (fictional) relationship between Hermione and Harry. (In the film version, this incident is not referred to.) [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] sends Harry's aunt, [[Petunia Dursley]], a Howler in ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'' to remind her of the agreement to allow Harry to live at Privet Drive when Harry's [[Uncle Vernon]] attempts to throw him out. (This incident is not referred to in the film version.)\n\n==Concealers==\n===Deluminator (Put-Outer)===\n[[Image:Albdelumin.jpg|thumb|upright|Dumbledore is using his Deluminator in the film ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]]] A Deluminator is a device invented by Albus Dumbledore that resembles a [[Lighter|cigarette lighter]]. It is used to remove or absorb (as well as return) the light from any light source to provide cover to the user. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', Dumbledore uses the Deluminator (then referred to as the ''Put-Outer''){{HP1}}<!-- Sorcerer's Stone Chapter 1 - The Boy Who lived \"Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance\" --> to darken Privet Drive, where the [[Dursley family]]'s house is located. It was next seen in ''Order of the Phoenix'' where Dumbledore loans the Deluminator to Moody, who uses it when transporting Harry from the Dursleys' home to [[Number 12, Grimmauld Place]] ([[Sirius]]\u2019s  home).  In ''Half-Blood Prince'', Dumbledore uses the Deluminator again to darken Privet Drive before collecting Harry.\n\nIn ''Deathly Hallows'', it is bequeathed to Ron by Dumbledore. After Ron had left his friends in anger, the Deluminator demonstrated an additional capability, similar to a homing device. Ron hears Hermione through the device as she says his name for the first time since he left, and, when he clicks it, the emitted ball of light enters his body and allows him to locate and Apparate to the vicinity of Harry and Hermione's camp. Rowling stated Dumbledore left it to Ron because he believed he might have needed a little more guidance than Harry and Hermione.\n\n===Invisibility Cloak===\n{{See also|#Harry's Cloak of Invisibility|l1=Harry's Cloak of Invisibility}} Within the [[Harry Potter universe|''Harry Potter'' universe]], an [[Cloak of invisibility|invisibility cloak]] is used to make the wearer [[invisible]]. All are very rare and expensive, and may be spun from pelts of the Demiguise, magical herbivores that are found in the Far East. They can also be ordinary cloaks with a Disillusionment Charm or a Bedazzlement Hex placed on them. Over time, these cloaks will lose their invisibility ability, eventually becoming opaque and vulnerable to penetration by various spells.\n\nHarry's cloak, being one of the three Deathly Hallows, is a true cloak of invisibility, and will retain its invisibility forever. It is also resistant to most simple spells and charms (e.g. the summoning charm).<ref>{{HPref|book=7|chapter=21}}</ref> Invisibility cloaks protect the wearer from visual detection only, meaning that even though the wearer cannot be seen they are still solid, and can therefore be felt by physical contact. [[Alastor Moody]]'s magically charmed eye is able to penetrate them. The cloak is less effective against some animals, such as cats (e.g. [[Mrs. Norris]]) and snakes (e.g. [[Nagini (Harry Potter)|Nagini]]). The Dementors in the books have no sense of sight and instead sense human despair, a sense unhindered by the use of an invisibility cloak.\n\nMoody is also known to possess two invisibility cloaks. One of these was borrowed by [[Sturgis Podmore]] in the course of work for the [[Order of the Phoenix (organisation)|Order of the Phoenix]]. [[Barty Crouch, Sr.]] possessed one as well, which he used to hide his son Barty Crouch, Jr. to prevent him from going to [[Azkaban]], the wizarding prison. Several times in the series, characters have been shown to either suspect or in some other fashion \"sense\" that Harry is wearing his cloak: Snape is seen to be suspicious when being followed by Harry, even reaching out to grab at (what appears to be) thin air; in ''Half-Blood Prince'', [[Draco Malfoy]] realises Harry is in his train carriage and successfully immobilizes him with a Petrificus Totalus (Body-Bind) curse, as despite wearing his cloak Harry inadvertently moved objects near him; and in ''Chamber of Secrets'', Albus Dumbledore senses Harry and Ron beneath it in Hagrid's cabin while talking to Lucius Malfoy during the event when [[Cornelius Fudge]] comes to take Hagrid to [[Azkaban]] and Lucius Malfoy hands over to Dumbledore his suspension letter. This may be due to Dumbledore possessing another of the 3 Deathly Hallows, The Elder Wand.\n\n== Deathly Hallows ==\n[[File:Deathly Hallows Sign.svg|right|thumb|The sign of the Deathly Hallows represents all three objects symbolically: the Wand, the Stone, and the Cloak.]]\nThe Deathly Hallows are three magical objects that are the focus of ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'' \u2013 the Elder Wand, the Resurrection Stone, and a cloak of invisibility. When owned by one person, they are said to give mastery over death. The objects are generally remembered only as part of a wizard's [[fairy tale]] called ''[[The Tale of the Three Brothers]]'', and have become [[mythological]] over time, but a small number of wizards including [[Dumbledore]] still believe in their existence and seek them. According to Rowling, the story about how these objects came into existence is based upon [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Pardoner's Tale]]''.<ref name=\"webchat\">{{cite news|url=http://www.bloomsbury.com/harrypotter/content.asp?sec=3&sec2=1 |date=31 July 2007 |accessdate=31 July 2007 |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]] |title=Online Chat Transcript |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214064648/http://www.bloomsbury.com/harrypotter/content.asp?sec=3&sec2=1 |archivedate=14 February 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nAccording to the tale, three brothers evaded [[Death (personification)|Death]], who gave them a choice of anything they wanted. The first brother chose a wand that could not be defeated in battle, the second brother asked for a way to bring back someone from the dead, and the third brother selected a cloak that made the wearer invisible, even to Death himself. Eventually, the first brother was killed, the second committed [[suicide]], and finally, the third brother made Death a friend and gave the cloak to his son.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The tales of Beedle the Bard|last=Rowling|first=J.K.|publisher=A&C Black|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pottermore.com/book-extract-long/a-lesson-on-the-hallows|title=A lesson on the Hallows \u2013 Pottermore|work=Pottermore|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en}}</ref> The story is generally believed to refer to the [[Supporting Harry Potter characters#The Peverell brothers|Peverell brothers]] centuries ago, although very few actually believe the story to be fully true. Dumbledore believed that the Peverells were simply particularly powerful and ingenious wizard inventors. The sign of the Deathly Hallows had also been adopted as a personal symbol by dark wizard [[Supporting Harry Potter characters#Gellert Grindelwald|Gellert Grindelwald]]; therefore many wizards, such as [[Viktor Krum]], mistakenly understood it to be a symbol of dark magic.\n\nDumbledore had sought the Hallows, initially in his youth as a friend of Grindelwald for the power they were said to bestow, but later on as a means to undo the accidental death of his sister. He eventually concluded he was \"unworthy\" to possess them. He feels Harry could be a more worthy custodian but also fears Harry would be enamored of their power, therefore he guides Harry to them in a circuitous manner.\n\nBy contrast, Voldemort simply sought the wand for its supposedly unbeatable power, after his previous wand unaccountably failed to kill Harry Potter. He had not realised that the wand was one of three Hallows, nor sought the other two Hallows. He also possessed the Resurrection Stone but only made use of it as a [[horcrux]]. Dumbledore says that he doubts Voldemort would have any interest in the Cloak or the Stone even if he did know about them.<ref>The Deathly Hallows, page 340:  Harry \"And Voldemort never knew about the Hallows?\"  Dumbledore \"I do not think so, because he did not recognize the Resurrection Stone he turned into a Horcrux. But even if he had known about them, Harry, I doubt that he would have been interested in any except the first. He would not think that he needed the Cloak, and as for the stone, whom would he want to bring back from the dead? He fears the dead. He does not love.\"</ref>\n\nHarry eventually comes to possess all three Hallows \u2013 the cloak being inherited from his father James Potter, later understood to be a descendant of one of the Peverell brothers, the Resurrection Stone in the [[Golden Snitch]] bequeathed to him by Dumbledore, and the allegiance and mastery of the Elder Wand when he defeats and disarms its prior owner, [[Draco Malfoy]], who unwittingly won it from Dumbledore at the time of the latter's death.\n\nAfter Voldemort's death, Harry uses the Elder Wand to repair his own damaged wand, then decides to return it to Dumbledore's tomb, so that when he has a natural death, the Elder Wand's power will die with him. In the film, Harry realizes that the Elder Wand is too dangerous to fall into the wrong hands again, so he snaps it in two and throws it off a bridge. He also drops the Resurrection Stone in the [[Hogwarts#Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]] but decides not to look for it in the hope that no wizard or witch will ever be able to own all three Hallows. He keeps the Cloak he had inherited, with the thought that he might pass it on to his children someday.\n\n=== Elder Wand ===\n[[File:The Elder Wand.jpg|thumb|A toy replica of the Elder Wand used in the movie]]\nThe Elder Wand, known throughout history as the Deathstick or the Wand of Destiny,{{HP7}} is an extremely powerful [[#Wand|wand]] made of [[Sambucus|elder]] wood with a core of [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Thestrals|Thestral]] tail hair.<ref name=\"jkextra25\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=25 |title=Extra Stuff |publisher=J.K.Rowling Official Site | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071208163107/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=25 | archivedate = 2007-12-08 }}</ref> While most wizards have heard of supposedly invincible wands in wizarding history, wand experts and seekers after the Deathly Hallows realize that these are the same wand, reappearing periodically in the hand of a new owner.\n\nAccording to the legend, the wand's allegiance can only be won by killing its previous owner, and therefore its \"bloody trail\" had become \"splattered across the pages of wizarding history\", making it the Hallow most easily verified to be a real object. However, Harry discovers from [[Supporting Harry Potter characters#Garrick Ollivander|Garrick Ollivander]] the wandmaker that this popular understanding is incorrect; the Elder Wand actually transfers its loyalty upon the defeat or disarmament, and not necessarily the killing, of its previous master. It will never work fully for a new owner otherwise. This subtle distinction becomes the basis upon which Voldemort is finally defeated, when he believes he has won the wand's allegiance by killing Snape, who killed Dumbledore, while Harry realizes in fact he had defeated the wand's true owner, Draco Malfoy, who had disarmed Dumbledore before Snape killed him. This left Harry and not Voldemort as the wand's true master in their final encounter, even though neither Draco nor Harry had physically possessed the Elder Wand at that point.\n\nAccording to wizard [[folklore]], the Elder Wand used by its true master cannot be defeated in a [[duel]]; this is incorrect, for Dumbledore was able to defeat the legendary dark wizard [[Supporting Harry Potter characters#Gellert Grindelwald|Gellert Grindelwald]], who was the master of the Elder Wand at that point.<ref>The Tales of Beedle The Bard \u2013 Page 104</ref> It also appears, as the wand is somewhat sentient (as are all wands), that it will not allow itself to cause real harm to its true master. If its master dies naturally without ever being defeated or disarmed, the wand's exceptional power will end for any following owner, since it was never won from the former.\n\nThe power of the Elder Wand was first shown in history, as [[Supporting Harry Potter characters#The Peverell brothers|Antioch Peverell]], the eldest of the mythical Three Brothers, had a duel with an enemy he had long wanted to defeat. He won, and left his enemy dead on the floor; however after boasting of his unbeatable wand, Antioch was robbed and killed in his sleep by a rival wanting to take the wand. It eventually came to the possession of Mykew Gregorovitch, a Bulgarian wandmaker. Gregorovitch boasted about possessing the Elder Wand, believing it would boost his popularity, and he tried to [[Reverse engineering|reverse engineer]]{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} its secrets as he faced competition from Ollivander. It was stolen from him by Grindelwald, a former friend of Dumbledore who sought to impose wizard power in the world. Grindelwald was defeated \"at the height of his power\" by Dumbledore, who in his later years considered it the \"only hallow [he] was fit to possess, not to boast of it or kill with it, but to tame it.\"\n\nDumbledore arranged his own death with [[Severus Snape]], intending in part for Snape to \"end up with the Elder Wand.\" Because his death would have been pre-arranged and not the result of his defeat, he had hoped this might break the wand's power. However, [[Draco Malfoy]] disarmed Dumbledore before his death at the hands of Snape, causing the plan to fail; the wand was buried in Dumbledore's tomb, but Draco had already unwittingly become its new master, even though he never took physical possession of it from Dumbledore. After Harry defeats Draco (even though Draco is not using the Elder Wand), the wand becomes loyal to Harry instead.\n\nIn the final book, Voldemort seeks the wand in order to defeat Harry \u2013 his previous wands having failed \u2013 and breaks into Dumbledore's tomb to claim the wand as his own. During the Battle of Hogwarts, he understands that the wand is not performing for him as legend says it should, and mistakenly concludes this is because it had become loyal to [[Severus Snape|Snape]] when Snape killed Dumbledore, and would only become loyal to him upon his killing of Snape. He therefore kills Snape, and believes the wand will thereafter serve him and be unbeatable, but during his final duel with Harry his Killing Curse rebounds and he dies \u2013 as Harry had warned him \u2013 since the Elder Wand will not allow itself to be used by him against its true master.\n\nAfter Voldemort's death, Harry uses the Elder Wand to repair his own broken holly and phoenix-feather wand, which he says he was \"happier with\", and says he'll return the Elder Wand to Dumbledore's grave, feeling that if he dies peacefully, its superior power will end. In the film, Harry snaps the wand in two and throws the pieces off a bridge.\n\nRon stated that the Elder Wand would be the Hallow he would choose, simply because it is the \"unbeatable wand\", arguing that it was only dangerous to the brother who requested it because he kept on talking about his ownership of it and encouraging people to fight him.  Hermione (who said she would choose the Cloak) is skeptical, reminding him that the Wand, by its very nature, would make its possessor overconfident and braggadocious.   Rowling revealed in an interview that the first working title for ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'' was ''Harry Potter and the Elder Wand''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hpana.com/news.20137.html |title=News: Transcript of JK Rowling web chat |publisher=Hpana.com |date=2007-07-30 |accessdate=2017-03-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Resurrection Stone ===\nThe Resurrection Stone allows the holder to bring back deceased loved ones, in a semi-physical form, and communicate with them. The form of Sirius Black generated by the stone tells Harry that he and the other forms created by the stone are part of him and invisible to others. This seems to suggest that these apparitions are conjured from memories and are not really resurrected people. According to the fairy tale concerning the origin of the Deathly Hallows, using the Resurrection Stone drove the owner to kill himself because he brought his late fianc\u00e9e back from the dead, and she was very unhappy in the real world for she did not belong there. By the time the stone was seen in [[Marvolo Gaunt]]'s possession, it had been set into a [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Marvolo Gaunt's Ring|ring]] that bore the symbol of the Deathly Hallows, which the ignorant Gaunt believed to be the Peverell [[coat of arms]]; he used the ring to boast about his ancestry and blood purity. Both Dumbledore and Grindelwald desired the stone, but for different reasons. While Dumbledore wanted it to communicate with his dead family, Grindelwald allegedly intended to use it to create an army of [[zombie]]-like [[Inferius|Inferi]]. Harry said this is the Hallow he would desire most, as like Dumbledore he could name people he would like to communicate with again. Voldemort became aware of the ring's antiquity and eventually used the stone as a Horcrux, a container for part of his [[soul]], being unaware of its additional magical properties.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nDumbledore recovered the ring from Marvolo's estate, recognizing it as both a Horcrux and one of the Deathly Hallows. Forgetting that as a Horcrux, it was likely to be protected by curses laid by Voldemort, and blinded by personal desire, Dumbledore attempted to use the Resurrection Stone to talk to his deceased family. The curse destroyed his hand and began to spread throughout his body. Though the spread was partly contained in the destroyed and blackened hand by Snape, Dumbledore was doomed, having, at most, a year left to live. In their Kings Cross encounter, Dumbledore told Harry that this proved he had learned nothing from his past mistakes and ambitions for using the Hallows, and was part of the reason for his fear that Harry might also become obsessed with their power if told of them.\n\nThe stone was later passed to Harry through Dumbledore's will, hidden inside the [[Golden Snitch]] Harry caught with his mouth, nearly swallowing it, in his first-ever [[Quidditch]] match. The Snitch revealed the message \"I open at the close\" when touched by Harry's lips. Harry is unable to open the Snitch until he is about to die in the Forest, and realizes then \"the close\" means the end, or his death. Harry uses the Stone to summon his deceased loved ones \u2013 his parents, his godfather [[Sirius Black]], and [[Remus Lupin]] \u2013 to comfort him and strengthen his courage, before he goes to meet his death at Voldemort's hand. The stone falls unseen from Harry's numb fingers in the [[Hogwarts#Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]] as he reaches Voldemort's encampment. Harry survives the encounter and he and Dumbledore's portrait later agreed that Harry will neither search for it nor tell others where it is. In a 2007 interview, Rowling said she would like to believe a [[centaur]]'s hoof pushed it into the ground, burying it forever.<ref name=\"webchat\" />\n\n=== Cloak of Invisibility ===\n[[File:Cloak of Invisibility.jpg|thumb|Invisibility cloak]]\n{{See also|#Invisibility Cloak|l1=Invisibility Cloaks}}{{anchor|Harry's Cloak of Invisibility}}\nAccording to the legend, the Cloak of Invisibility has the power to shield the wearer from being seen by Death. It was the Hallow belonging to the youngest brother, who did not trust Death and took the cloak to hide from him, only giving it up when he was old and ready for death. It is owned by Harry throughout the series, although only later does he discover its significance and origin.\n\nUnlike other invisibility cloaks known to exist, this is uniquely a true [[#Invisibility Cloaks|invisibility cloak]], in that it is able to completely shield the wearer and others from sight and cannot be worn out by time or spells; other cloaks will lose their ability to conceal the wearer over time or become worn out, but the Hallow cloak will never fade or become damaged. At the end of ''Deathly Hallows'', Dumbledore explains to Harry the Cloak's true magic is it can shield and protect others as well as its owner. This is apparent when it does not respond to a Death Eater's Summoning Charm while concealing Harry, Ron and Hermione in ''Deathly Hallows''. Hermione claims that this is the Hallow she would choose, citing the usefulness Harry has found of it.\n\nThe cloak originally belonged to [[Supporting Harry Potter characters#The Peverell brothers|Ignotus Peverell]]. After his death, the cloak was passed down from father to son through Peverell's descendants, through his granddaughter, Iolanthe Peverell of Godric's Hollow, who married Hardwin Potter of the Gloucestershire Potters, all the way directly down to [[James Potter (character)|James Potter]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/1000-aol-chat.htm |title=J.K. Rowling Web Chat Transcript |date=30 July 2007 |accessdate=19 October 2007 |publisher=Accio Quote}}</ref> The Cloak was not in James' possession the night he was murdered; he had previously lent it to Dumbledore, who was greatly interested in the Deathly Hallows and suspected that the Potter family heirloom was more than it appeared. Dumbledore returned the Cloak to Harry a decade later as a Christmas present during his first year at Hogwarts. Harry uses the Cloak throughout the series in order to sneak around the school on various adventures. Harry's father also used the cloak for similar purposes. It is large enough for Ron and Hermione to accompany him as 1st years, and they frequently do, although this becomes increasingly difficult as they grow taller throughout the series.\n\nWhile making the wearer invisible to Muggles and wizards, some creatures are able to sense people hidden under it. Snakes, for example, cannot see through the Cloak of Invisibility, but they can somehow detect people under it. Mrs. Norris, [[Argus Filch|Filch]]'s cat, also seems to sense Harry when he wears the cloak. Wearers can also be detected by the \"Homenum Revelio\" spell.<ref name=\"webchat\" /> In ''Goblet of Fire'', Moody's magical eye can see Harry under the cloak. In ''Prisoner of Azkaban'', Dumbledore warns that the [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Dementors|Dementors']] perception of humans is unhindered by invisibility cloaks, as they are blind and sense people through emotions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomsbury.com/harrypotter/content.asp?sec=3&sec2=1 |title=Harry Potter at Bloomsbury |publisher=Bloomsbury.com |accessdate=25 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214064648/http://www.bloomsbury.com/harrypotter/content.asp?sec=3&sec2=1 |archivedate=14 February 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn the play ''[[Harry Potter and the Cursed Child]]'', Harry gifts the Invisibility Cloak to his eldest son James Potter, noting he'd \"been going on about the Invisibility Cloak since time itself\".  However, James' younger brother Albus (the protagonist of the play) steals the Cloak and uses it to evade bullies at Hogwarts.\n\n==Detectors==\n===Foe-glass===\nA Foe-glass is a mirror that detects and shows its owner's enemies in or out of focus, depending on how close they are. Moody, in reality [[Barty Crouch, Jr.]] in disguise, said that when the whites of their eyes are visible, he is in trouble. When Moody/Crouch was attacking Harry, Harry watched Professors Snape, McGonagall and Dumbledore approach the room in the mirror before they actually got there.  A Foe-glass is hanging in the Room of Requirement in ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'' when Harry uses the Room for D.A. meetings. Like all dark detectors, it can be fooled, as mentioned by Harry at the beginning of the first D.A. meeting.\n\n===The Marauder's Map===\n[[File:The Marauder's Map (opened).jpg|thumb]]\n{{anchor|Marauder's Map}}The Marauder's Map is a magical map of Hogwarts created by [[Remus Lupin]], [[Scabbers|Peter Pettigrew]], [[Sirius Black]], and [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)#James Potter|James Potter]] (respectively nicknamed \"Moony\", \"Wormtail\", \"Padfoot\", and \"Prongs\") while they were students at Hogwarts. During this time, they gained extensive knowledge about the school grounds, such as its various hidden passages, from their frequent night-time adventures together.\n\nIn ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', Fred and George Weasley give the map to Harry so he can travel to the village of Hogsmeade through a hidden passageway. The twins had previously stolen the map from a drawer in Filch's office that contained dangerous confiscated objects; it is revealed by Lupin that Filch probably knew what it was but not how to work it. [[Severus Snape|Snape]] later finds the map in Harry's possession and tries to force it to reveal its secrets, but the map merely mocks and insults him. Lupin (one of the creators of the map), the current [[Magic in Harry Potter|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher, is called upon to investigate this \"dark object\", and confiscates it to keep Harry safe, though he returns it to Harry after resigning his post at Hogwarts. From then on, the map becomes one of Harry's most useful tools in his ongoing adventures.\n\nAt first glance, the Map is simply a blank piece of parchment; but when the user points his wand at the Map and says, \"I solemnly swear that I am up to no good\", the message \"[[Mr.|Messrs]]. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs, purveyors of aids to magical mischief-makers, are proud to present the Marauder's Map,\" and a detailed layout of Hogwarts appears. Saying, \"Mischief managed!\" while pointing one's wand on the parchment returns the map to its original blank state. The map displays the location of everyone within the castle and its grounds, and includes the location of secret passageways and instructions on how to access them. Several locations like the Room of Requirement and the Chamber of Secrets do not appear on the map, either as the Marauders did not have any knowledge of them, or, in the case of the former, they are not a fixed location. Furthermore, Animagus disguises, [[Polyjuice Potion]], and [[#Invisibility Cloaks|Invisibility Cloaks]] cannot fool the map, as shown in ''Goblet of Fire'' when Barty Crouch, Jr., using a Polyjuice Potion to disguise himself as Moody,{{HP4}} and in ''Prisoner of Azkaban'' when Peter Pettigrew, who is supposed to be dead {{HP3}} but as an Animagus has transformed into a rat, are both displayed on the map.\n\nOn the prop version of the map made for the films, the lines are made up of what at first glance are just random letters, but upon closer inspection are [[Latin]] words. The series makes no mention of Harry recovering the map from Moody's office, even though he continued to use it in later books; when asked about this discrepancy, [[J. K. Rowling|Rowling]] answered that Harry had indeed sneaked into the office and recovered it in the days following the Third Task, and that she had forgotten to include this detail in the book. When asked during an online question session, \"What child did Harry give the Marauder's Map to, if any?\" (after his school years), [[J. K. Rowling|Rowling]] responded, \"I've got a feeling he didn't give it to any of them, but that [[James Sirius Potter|James]] (Harry's eldest son) sneaked it out of his father's desk one day.\"<ref name=\"webchat\"/> However, in ''Cursed Child'', Harry is shown to still possess the Marauder's Map and gives it to Professor McGonagall to keep an eye on his wayward son Albus Potter.\n\nIn [[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]], the fake professor Moody \u201cborrowed\u201d the map when Snape found the map. [[The Marauder's Map]] was first mentioned in [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]].\n\n===Probity Probe===\nA Probity Probe detects spells of concealment and hidden magical objects. The detector made its first appearance in ''Order of the Phoenix'' at the Ministry of Magic as a thin golden rod. After Voldemort's return, Probes are used as part of the increased security at [[Gringotts]] as well as for scanning the students of Hogwarts for Dark objects. They are last seen when Harry, Ron, and Hermione arrive at Gringotts in ''Deathly Hallows'' to rob Bellatrix Lestrange's vault of one of Voldemort's Horcruxes.\n\n===Remembrall===\n[[File:The Making of Harry Potter 29-05-2012 (Remembrall).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|]]\nA Remembrall is a small, clear orb, about the size of a large marble, containing smoke that turns red when it detects that the person holding it has forgotten something. It does not tell the holder what has been forgotten. The forgetful Neville Longbottom is sent a Remembrall by his grandmother in ''Philosopher's Stone.'' Remembralls are forbidden from being used during the O.W.L. exams.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix|last=Rowling|first=J.K.|publisher=Scholastic|year=2003|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=708\u2013709}}</ref>\n\n===Revealer===\nA Revealer is a bright red [[eraser]], used to make [[invisible ink]] appear. It made its first appearance in ''Chamber of Secrets'' when Hermione tried to make hidden writing appear in [[Tom Riddle's diary]].\n\n===Secrecy Sensor===\nThe Secrecy Sensor is a dark detector described as \"an object that looked something like an extra-squiggly, golden television aerial.\" It vibrates when it detects concealment and lies. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', Moody mentions that it is \"no use here, of course, too much interference \u2014 students in every direction lying about why they haven\u2019t done their homework.\" However, it may have been responding to Moody's own deception, as he was actually Barty Crouch Jr in disguise with a Polyjuice Potion.\n\nIn ''Order of the Phoenix'', Secrecy Sensors are used at the Atrium Desk in the [[Ministry of Magic]] upon visitors to the government locale. Later in the book, Harry mentions to [[Dumbledore's Army]] that they can be easily fooled like their other dark-detecting counterparts. In ''Half-Blood Prince'', due to Hogwarts' new stringent security measures, [[Argus Filch]] is assigned to inspect every student entering the castle with Secrecy Sensors. All the owls flying into Hogwarts are also placed under this measure to ensure that no Dark object enters the castle through mail. Hermione later explains that although Secrecy Sensors detect jinxes, curses, and Concealment Charms, they cannot detect love potions, as they are not considered Dark.\n\n===Sneakoscope===\nA Sneakoscope serves as a [[Dark Arts (Harry Potter)|Dark Arts]] detector. The device is described as a miniature glass-spinning top that emits shrill noises in the presence of deception, for instance, when an untrustworthy person is near or when a deceitful event takes place nearby.\n\nSneakoscopes are introduced in ''Prisoner of Azkaban'' when Harry receives a pocket-sized version from Ron for his 13th birthday. Bill says that Pocket Sneakoscopes are unreliable, as it lit up and spun at dinner for apparently no reason, but Fred and George had put beetles in his soup without his knowledge. The sneakoscope appears again on the [[Hogwarts Express]], and again in Harry and Ron's dormitory. Harry later discovers that Scabbers, Ron's rat, who is present each time the Sneakoscope is spinning, is actually [[Scabbers|Peter Pettigrew]] in [[Animagus]] form. In ''Goblet of Fire'', the somewhat paranoid Moody has several sneakoscopes that he somehow disabled (possibly related to a crack it was described as having), claiming, \"It wouldn't stop whistling\", keeping them in one of the seven compartments of his magical trunk.  Moody was later revealed to actually be Barty Crouch, Jr. under the effects of the Polyjuice Potion, thus explaining the constant alerts in his presence. Finally in ''Deathly Hallows'', Hermione gives Harry a Sneakoscope for his seventeenth birthday which they later use as a lookout while in hiding.\n\n===Weasley family clock===\n[[File:The Making of Harry Potter 29-05-2012 (7388833700).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|]]\nThe Weasleys have a special clock in their home, [[The Burrow (Harry Potter)|the Burrow]], with nine hands, one for every member of the family. Instead of telling the time, the clock reveals the location or status of each family member. The known locations are: ''Home'', ''School'', ''Work'', ''Travelling'', ''Lost'', ''Hospital'', ''Prison'', and ''Mortal Peril''. The Weasleys are the only family mentioned in the series to own such a clock. Dumbledore calls the clock \"excellent\" and seems impressed by it.<ref>Order of the Phoenix - Dumbledore: ''\"That will be a job for Fawkes when he has finished keeping a lookout for anybody approaching, but she may already know... that excellent clock of hers...\"''</ref>\n\nThe location ''Mortal Peril'' is situated where the numeral 12 would normally be. Throughout the first five books the hands change to reflect the varying statuses of the family members, but by the sixth book all nine hands point to ''mortal peril'' at all times, except when someone is travelling. Mrs. Weasley takes this to mean that with Voldemort's return, everyone is always in mortal peril, but she cannot verify this as she does not know anyone else who has a clock like hers.{{HP6}}\n\nVarious fans have re-created the clock for their own families, for example by using [[geofencing]] for cell phones.<ref>[http://elitedaily.com/envision/real-life-weasleys-clock-harry-potter/1387519/ This \u2018Harry Potter' Fan Made An Epic Real-Life Version Of The Weasley Clock]</ref><ref>[http://www.instructables.com/id/Weasley-Clock/ Weasley Clock in 9 Steps]</ref>\n\n==Games==\n===Exploding Snap===\nExploding Snap is a wizarding card game in which the cards spontaneously explode during games. The game is popular with Hogwarts students. In ''Chamber of Secrets'', Harry and Ron are held back from investigating why spiders were fleeing Hogwarts because [[Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]] delayed them with this game. Ron later singed his eyebrows while building a card house with Exploding Snap cards. In ''Order of the Phoenix'', [[Lee Jordan (Harry Potter)|Lee Jordan]] is punished by [[Dolores Umbridge]] for saying that she cannot tell them off for playing this game, as one of her Educational Decrees states that teachers can only talk to students about the subjects they are paid to teach. In ''Cursed Child'' Ginny remembers playing this game with Harry following the events of ''Chamber of Secrets'' and notes that it helped her to recover from the trauma (all the other students avoided her after learning the truth).\n\n===Gobstones===\nGobstones is one of the many magical games played by young wizards in the books, along with Wizard's Chess and Exploding Snap. Gobstones is similar to the Muggle games of [[marbles]] and [[p\u00e9tanque]], except that in Gobstones, the balls spit, or gob, a foul smelling liquid in the face of the opposing player when they lose a point. Hogwarts students are seen playing Gobstones throughout the books, and there is even a Gobstones Club at the school. It is also noted in the ''Harry Potter'' series that Eileen Prince (Snape's mother) was captain of Hogwarts' Gobstone Club, as a student, at age 15.\n\n===Quidditch balls===\nThe [[Quidditch]] balls consist of a Quaffle, a large red ball (and the only one not bewitched to fly on its own) which the Chasers need to get through the three hoops on the field, gaining ten points each time this successfully occurs; two Bludgers, which fly around attempting to disturb the game and knock people off their brooms, and which the Beaters hit away from teammates and towards the opposing team; and the Golden Snitch, a very fast and difficult-to-see golden orb the size of a walnut with wings, which the Seeker on each team must capture to finish the game and gain 150 points. The Quidditch players wear gloves, leg pads, padded head guards, and occasionally goggles.\n\n===Self-Shuffling Playing Cards===\nIn ''Chamber of Secrets'', a pack of Self-Shuffling Cards is mentioned as one of the various objects littering the floor of Ron's room in the Burrow.<ref name=\"CS3\">{{HPref|book=2|chapter=3}}</ref>\n\n===Wizard's Chess===\nWizard's Chess is played with pieces and a board identical to [[Chess]]. The rules are also unchanged. The pieces are magically animated, and they violently attack each other when performing a capture, by knocking the captured piece out and dragging it off the board.<ref>{{cite web | date = July 23, 2005 | author = Mark Weeks | url = http://chess.about.com/b/a/187742.htm | title = Elsewhere on the Web: Harry Potter Wizard Chess | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051022095438/http://chess.about.com/b/a/187742.htm | archivedate = 2005-10-22 }}</ref> The players order the pieces to move using [[algebraic chess notation]].\n[[File:HIMG 2759 (8066426928).jpg|thumb]]\nRon has a wizard's chess set left to him by his grandfather and Harry first plays with pieces borrowed from [[Seamus Finnigan]], which kept shouting him advice because they did not trust him.{{HP1}} Harry later gets a set of his own in one of his wizard crackers during his first Christmas at Hogwarts.\n\nDuring the climactic chapters of ''Philosopher's Stone'', Harry, Ron and Hermione become [[human chess]] pieces in a life-sized game of Wizard's Chess, which Harry wins thanks to Ron's advice and [[sacrifice (chess)|sacrifice]] as a piece. In the films, the chess pieces are depicted using replicas of [[Lewis Chessmen]].\n\n==Horcruxes==\nA Horcrux is an object used to store part of a person's soul, protecting him or her from death (a function similar to a Lich's [[Lich|phylactery]] from other fantasy works). If the body of a Horcrux owner is killed, that portion of the soul that had remained in the body does not pass on to the next world, but will rather exist in a non-corporeal form capable of being resurrected by another wizard, as stated in ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]]''. If all of someone's Horcruxes are destroyed, then the soul's only anchor in the material world would be the body, the destruction of which would then cause final death. The creation of Horcruxes is considered the darkest of all magic.\n\nThis method was chosen by Voldemort to attain [[immortality]]. The concept is introduced in ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince''. Rowling uses [[Horace Slughorn]]'s expository dialogue to reveal that the creation of a Horcrux requires one to commit a murder, which, as the supreme act of evil, \"rips the soul apart\".<ref>Rowling, J.K. (2005). ''Half-Blood Prince'' (in English). London: Bloomsbury Publishing, et al. p. 465. UK {{ISBN|0-7475-8108-8}}.</ref> After the murder, a spell is cast to infuse part of the ripped soul into an object, which then becomes a Horcrux. Rowling has never published the actual enchantment. In the final book of the series, Hermione finds the spell in a book titled ''Secrets of the Darkest Art''.<ref>Rowling, J.K. (2007). ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'' (in English). London: Bloomsbury Publishing, et al. p. 465. UK {{ISBN|0-7475-8108-8}}.</ref> Rowling has revealed that she intends to detail the process and spell used to create a Horcrux in her long-mentioned ''Harry Potter'' Encyclopedia.<ref>{{cite web|author=MuggleNet |url=http://www.mugglenet.com/books/futurebooks/encyclopedia/index.shtml |title=Mugglenet.com |publisher=Mugglenet.com |date=17 November 2004 |accessdate=25 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124042748/http://www.mugglenet.com/books/futurebooks/encyclopedia/index.shtml |archivedate=24 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nBoth inanimate objects and living organisms have been used as Horcruxes, though the latter are considered riskier to use, since a living being can move and think for itself. There is no limit to the number of Horcruxes a witch or wizard can create. As the creator's soul is divided into progressively smaller portions, they lose more of their natural humanity and the soul becomes increasingly unstable. Consequently, under very specific conditions, a soul fragment can be sealed within an object without the intention or knowledge of the creator. While the object thus affected will, like any Horcrux, preserve the immortality of the creator, it does not become a \"Dark object\".<ref name=\"pottercast166\" /> For example, Voldemort has unusual control over Nagini,<ref>Mentioned by Dumbledore to Harry in ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince''.</ref> and consequently Nagini is able to communicate with Voldemort about the presence of Harry in Godric's Hollow in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows''.\n\n<!--READ THIS BEFORE EDITING\nThis section is not the place to put specific means of destruction used in the books (Basilisk venom and Fiendfyre). Those details are given later in the article. This section is for general information.-->Horcruxes made from inanimate objects are extremely difficult to destroy. They cannot be destroyed by conventional means such as smashing, breaking, or burning. To be destroyed, a Horcrux must suffer damage so severe that repair through magical means would be impossible. Very few magical objects or spells are powerful enough to achieve this (mentioned and used were the Fiendfyre, Gryffindor's Sword and Basilisk fang, the last two only being able to inflict such damage due to the basilisk venom permeating them both). Once a Horcrux is irreparably damaged, the fragment of soul within it is destroyed. A Horcrux can be deliberately undone magically only if the creator goes through a process of deep remorse for the murder committed to create the Horcrux. The pain of this remorse can be so excruciating that the process may kill the creator.{{HP7}}\n\nVoldemort's creation of Horcruxes is central to the later storyline of the ''Harry Potter'' novels. As the number seven is a powerful number in magic, Voldemort intended to split his soul into that many pieces, with six Horcruxes and the last piece reposing within his body.<ref name=\"HBPp506\">Half-Blood Prince (US Scholastic Hardback edition), p. 506</ref> When Voldemort attacked the Potter family, and his body was destroyed by the rebounded Killing Curse, a piece of his soul splintered off and attached itself to the only living thing remaining in the room, Harry Potter, in a manner similar to a Horcrux.<ref name=\"pottercast166\">{{cite web|url=http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/12/23/transcript-of-part-1-of-pottercast-s-jk-rowling-interview |title=Transcript of Part 1 of PotterCast\u2019s JK Rowling Interview |publisher=The-Leaky-Cauldron.org |date=23 December 2007 |accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref> Later on, Voldemort went on to complete his collection of the intended six Horcruxes by turning his snake Nagini into one, thus fragmenting his soul into a total of eight (counting the one residing in his own body), not seven, pieces. By that time, though, unbeknownst to Voldemort himself, the diary had already been destroyed and, therefore, the seven Horcruxes never all existed together at the same point in time. \n\nAll of Voldemort's deliberately created Horcruxes were made using objects that had been important to him or that held some sentimental value. He hid some of them carefully so that no one could find and destroy them, but used Nagini to do his bidding on several occasions, and the diary was always intended to be a weapon to carry out Voldemort's plan to remove Muggle-borns from Hogwarts. Even without magical protection, Horcruxes cannot be destroyed by any means of wand usage or physical force. <!-- The lost diadem of Ravenclaw is destroyed by Fiendfyre in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows''. [Commented out dubious claim that this is an exception to the rules] --> In ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'', Harry intentionally destroys the diary with a Basilisk fang,<ref name=\"HBPp504\">Half-Blood Prince (US Scholastic Hardback edition), p. 504</ref> although unaware it was a Horcrux at the time, to free Ginny from its influence. In ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', the discovery of the diary is revealed as the proof that leads to Dumbledore beginning the hunt for other Horcruxes, as it not only gives absolute proof that Voldemort split his soul, but also that there were likely other, better protected artifacts, given the risk Voldemort was taking by using the diary as a weapon.\n\nRowling revealed on [[Pottermore]] that [[Quirinus Quirrell]] served as a temporary Horcrux when Voldemort's soul possessed his body during Harry's first year at Hogwarts. A notable difference, however, is that the piece of soul within Quirrell was able to exist without its container, as it abandoned Quirrell and left him to die in the underground chambers.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rowling|first1=J.K.|title=Professor Quirrell|url=https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/professor-quirrell|website=Pottermore|accessdate=7 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Tom Riddle's diary===\n[[File:Tom Riddle's Diary.jpg|thumb|upright|Tom Riddle's diary, with the basilisk fang that destroyed its horcrux]]\nTom Riddle created his first Horcrux during his fifth year at Hogwarts, using his own school diary. He cast the spell after murdering his fellow student [[Supporting Harry Potter characters#Moaning Myrtle|Myrtle Warren]] using the [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Basilisk|Basilisk]]. The diary is introduced in the thirteenth chapter of ''Chamber of Secrets'' and is destroyed by Harry Potter during the climax of the same book.\n\nBefore Voldemort's downfall, he entrusted the Horcrux to [[Lucius Malfoy]]. While aware of its corrupting magical properties, Malfoy did not know the diary was a Horcrux, Voldemort having informed him of its value as a weapon but believing that he would be in a position to coordinate Malfoy's use of it. In an attempt to discredit [[Arthur Weasley]] as well as dispose of an incriminating Dark object, Malfoy hid the diary in [[Ginny Weasley]]'s cauldron amidst her other books. Tom Riddle's soul-fragment possessed Ginny and, through her, reopened the [[Chamber of Secrets]], eventually starting to draw her life from her. At the end of book two, Harry saved Ginny and destroyed the diary by stabbing it with the venomous fang of a Basilisk, making it the first Horcrux to be destroyed. His reports of the diary's behavior to Dumbledore were the latter's first inkling that Voldemort might have created not just one Horcrux, but several: \"What intrigued and alarmed me most was that the diary had been intended as a weapon as much as a safeguard\",<ref>Rowling, ''Half-Blood Prince'' (Arthur A. Levine Books edition), pp.500</ref> implying that Voldemort must have had backups of some sort. It is also mentioned that Lucius was meant to wait for Voldemort's authorization before allowing the diary to be smuggled into Hogwarts, and that he never received it before Voldemort's first defeat. Voldemort did not learn of the diary's destruction until he forced the truth out of Lucius, and he became greatly enraged at the manner in which Lucius had so recklessly endangered it.\n\nTo Rowling, a diary is a very scary object, having said in an interview: \"The temptation particularly for a young girl, is to pour out her heart to a diary.\" Rowling's little sister Diane was prone to this, and her great fear was that someone would read her diary. This gave Rowling the idea to have a diary that is, in itself, against the confider.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hp-lexicon.org/thing/diary-of-tom-riddle/ |title=Diary of Tom Riddle \u2013 The Harry Potter Lexicon  |publisher=The Harry Potter Lexicon |accessdate=2017-03-01}}</ref> When asked what would have happened if Ginny had died and Riddle had managed to escape, Rowling revealed that \"it would have strengthened the present-day Voldemort considerably.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=17 | title = In 'Chamber of Secrets', what would have happened if Ginny had died and Tom Riddle had escaped the diary |publisher=J.K.Rowling Official Site | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060316221413/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=17 | archivedate = 16 March 2006 | website = jkrowling.com | accessdate = 25 December 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Marvolo Gaunt's Ring===\n[[File:Marvolo Gaunt's ring with Resurrection Stone.jpg|thumb|Marvolo Gaunt's ring with the Resurrection Stone]]\nTom Riddle created his second Horcrux using a ring owned by his maternal grandfather, [[Marvolo Gaunt]], during the summer before his sixth year as a student at [[Hogwarts]], when he was fifteen years old. The murder that created the Horcrux was that of his father. The ring is introduced during the fourth chapter of ''Half-Blood Prince'', having already been destroyed by [[Albus Dumbledore]].\n\nIn a [[Pensieve]] memory, it is revealed that Riddle had taken the gold ring, which has a black stone inscribed with a magical symbol, from his uncle [[Morfin Gaunt]], whom he had framed for the murder of his Muggle father and grandparents by altering his uncle's memories. Riddle wears the ring while still a student at Hogwarts, but eventually hides it in the house where the Gaunt family had lived. It remains hidden under the floorboards, placed in a golden box and protected by several enchantments, until Dumbledore finds it during the summer break between the events of ''Order of the Phoenix'' and ''Half-Blood Prince''. Dumbledore destroys the second Horcrux with [[Gryffindor Sword|Godric Gryffindor's sword]], but, as revealed in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', he also recognizes the stone in the ring as the [[Resurrection Stone]], one of the three [[Deathly Hallows (object)|Deathly Hallows]].  The Resurrection Stone was the Hallow Dumbledore most desired, hoping to assuage his guilt for his part in the death of his sister, Ariana.  Though afterwards, he recognizes it as totally unwise, Dumbledore, forgetting it was also a Horcrux and thus likely to be protected by destructive enchantments, hoping to activate it and apologise to his long-dead family, places the ring on his hand. He is mortally injured by the ring's curses. The injury leaves his right hand permanently disfigured and would have killed him quickly if not for the intervention of Snape who slowed the curse to Dumbledore's withered right hand and arm, but could not stop it from eventually killing him, had it run its course.<ref>Rowling, ''Deathly Hallows'' (Arthur A. Levine Books edition), pp.680\u2013683</ref> The damaged ring is kept for a time on a table in the Headmaster's office.\n\nBefore his death, Dumbledore hides the ring's black stone inside a [[Golden Snitch]] and he bequeaths the Snitch to Harry in his will.  Voldemort remained unaware of the stone's additional magical properties throughout his lifetime, Dumbledore noting that Voldemort's fear of death and lack of loved ones would have given him no reason to be interested in the Stone for its original purpose, and doubting that Marvolo would have been remotely interested in or aware of the Stone's true history.\n\n===Helga Hufflepuff's Cup===\n[[File:Helga Hufflepuff's cup.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Helga Hufflepuff's cup]]\nTom Riddle created his third Horcrux using [[Helga Hufflepuff|Helga Hufflepuff's]] cup. The cup is introduced during the twentieth chapter of ''Half-Blood Prince'' and is destroyed by Hermione Granger in the thirty-first chapter of ''Deathly Hallows''.\n\n[[Hepzibah Smith]], who owned the cup, was a distant descendant of Helga Hufflepuff. Riddle killed Smith by poisoning her, stole the cup, then framed her house elf [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Hokey|Hokey]] for the crime. Voldemort entrusted the cup to [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], who kept it protected in her vault at [[Gringotts Bank]], a place to which Harry guessed a once penniless Voldemort would have always coveted a connection. Additional protective spells, including Gemino (multiply curse) and Flagrante (fire curse), were used to protect the contents of the vault. Harry, Ron and Hermione, with Hermione disguised as Bellatrix, broke into the bank and stole the cup. Hermione later destroyed the Horcrux using a fang from the remains of the [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Basilisk|Basilisk]] still in the [[Chamber of Secrets]].\n\n{{-}}\n===Salazar Slytherin's Locket===\n[[File:Salazar Slytherin's Locket (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Salazar Slytherin's locket]]\nRiddle created his fourth Horcrux using his own ancestor [[Salazar Slytherin|Salazar Slytherin's]] [[locket]], which had once belonged to Riddle's mother, [[Merope Gaunt]]. The spell was cast after Riddle murdered a Muggle tramp.<ref name=\"RowlingWeb2007\">{{cite news|url=http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/7/30/j-k-rowling-web-chat-transcript|title=J.K. Rowling Web Chat Transcript|date=30 July 2007|publisher=[[The Leaky Cauldron (website)|The Leaky Cauldron]]|accessdate=30 July 2007}}</ref> The locket is introduced briefly in the sixth chapter of ''Order of the Phoenix'' (described only as \"a heavy locket that not one of them could open\") and is destroyed by Ron Weasley in the nineteenth chapter of ''Deathly Hallows''.\n\nSlytherin's locket was passed down through the generations and eventually ended up in the possession of Merope Gaunt. After being abandoned by her husband [[Riddle family|Tom Riddle Sr.]], Merope sold the locket to Caractacus Burke, shopkeeper of [[Knockturn Alley|Borgin & Burkes]], for 10 Galleons, a small fraction of the locket's true value. The locket was eventually sold to Hepzibah Smith. Riddle stole the locket, along with Helga Hufflepuff's cup, after murdering Smith. Once the locket became a Horcrux, Voldemort hid it in a seaside cave where he had once terrorised two of his fellow orphans. The cave's magical protection included a door that could only be opened with a blood offering, an enchanted boat, a basin of potion that causes pain and horrific visions to the drinker, and the use of [[Inferius|Inferi]]. Dumbledore and Harry Potter pursued the locket in ''The Half-Blood Prince'' only to find a fake one at the bottom of the basin.\n\nDisillusioned Death Eater [[Regulus Black]] had learned about the Horcrux and its hiding place from his house elf [[Kreacher]], whom he had originally volunteered to accompany Voldemort to hide the Horcrux. In an effort to bring about Voldemort's eventual downfall, he and Kreacher navigated the magical protection and stole the locket, replacing it with the false one to fool Voldemort. While Black died in the effort, killed by the surrounding Inferi, Kreacher took the locket back to their home at [[Number 12 Grimmauld Place|Number 12, Grimmauld Place]]. Unable to destroy it like Black ordered, Kreacher continued to protect the locket for years. While the [[Order of the Phoenix (organisation)|Order of the Phoenix]] was using the house as its headquarters, the locket was stolen by [[Order of the Phoenix (organisation)#Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus Fletcher]], a petty criminal and member of the Order. He gave it to [[Dolores Umbridge]] as a bribe when she caught him selling stolen property.\n\nTwo weeks after learning these details, Harry, Ron, and Hermione infiltrated the [[Ministry of Magic]], where Umbridge worked, and stole the locket. Ron later saved Harry from being strangled by it when he wore it around his neck while attempting to retrieve the sword of [[Godric Gryffindor]] from the bottom of a lake in the [[Forest of Dean]]. When Ron attempted to destroy the locket, the fragment of soul inside assumed the shape of Harry and Hermione and played on Ron's fear that his two friends had started a romantic relationship during his absence. Briefly at this point, Ron's eyes gleamed scarlet, like Voldemort's. Ron destroyed the locket using the sword of Gryffindor in the same forest.\n\n{{-}}\n\n===Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem===\n[[File:Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem.jpg|thumb|Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem]]\nTom Riddle created his fifth Horcrux using [[Rowena Ravenclaw|Rowena Ravenclaw's]] [[diadem]]. The diadem is introduced briefly in the twenty-fourth chapter of ''Half-Blood Prince'' (described as \"a tarnished tiara\" in the Room of Requirement), but was later introduced by name and destroyed by Vincent Crabbe in the thirty-first chapter of ''Deathly Hallows''.\n\nRavenclaw's daughter, Helena, stole the diadem from her mother in an attempt to become more intelligent than her mother. She fled to [[Albania]], where she hid the diadem in the hollow of a tree when the Bloody Baron searched for her. After Helena was murdered by the Bloody Baron, she became the Ravenclaw [[Hogwarts ghosts|house ghost]] and Tom Riddle, while a student at the school, charmed her into telling him the location of the diadem. Shortly after leaving Hogwarts and after the murder of Hepzibah Smith, he traveled to Albania and seized the artifact.<ref name=\"Deathly Hallows (Amazon)\">{{cite book|first=J. K.|last = Rowling|title=Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows|publisher=Bloomsbury; Children's edition (21 July 2007)|isbn=0-7475-9105-9|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0747591059}}</ref> Voldemort murdered an Albanian peasant to turn the diadem into a Horcrux.<ref name=\"RowlingWeb2007\"/> Years later, when Voldemort returned to Hogwarts, reapplying for the Defence Against the Dark Arts position but denied the job by Albus Dumbledore, he hid the diadem in the Room of Requirement. Because Voldemort believed himself to be the only one to have discovered the Room, he never placed any curses around the diadem.<ref name=\"Deathly Hallows (Amazon)\"/>\n\nIn ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', Harry first comes into contact with the diadem when he hastily hides Snape's old potions book in the Room of Requirement. The diadem was mentioned merely as an \"old discoloured tiara\" in the sixth book; Harry used it to help mark the spot so he could later find where he placed the book. Later, after having the diadem described to him by the Ravenclaw ghost, Harry recalls this scene and hurries to retrieve it from the Room.<ref name=\"Deathly Hallows (Amazon)\"/> The diadem was unintentionally destroyed by a Fiendfyre curse cast by [[Supporting Harry Potter characters#Crabbe and Goyle|Vincent Crabbe]] as he, [[Gregory Goyle]], and Draco Malfoy attacked Harry, Ron, and Hermione inside the Room.<ref name=\"Deathly Hallows (Amazon)\"/> In the film version, Harry stabs the diadem with another basilisk fang and Ron kicks it into the Room of Requirement, as the Fiendfyre reaches the door.\n\n===Nagini===\n{{Main|Nagini (Harry Potter)}}\nThe sixth Horcrux was Nagini, the snake Voldemort had with him constantly. This Horcrux was created by Voldemort when he was hiding in the forests of Albania; the murder victim whom he used for its creation was Bertha Jorkins. He found Nagini, and becoming smitten by the snake, turned it into a Horcrux, being connected with it.<ref name=\"RowlingWeb2007\" /> In the last chapter of ''Deathly Hallows'', Nagini was killed by Neville Longbottom using the sword of Godric Gryffindor. The destruction of the last remaining Horcrux made Voldemort mortal.\n\n===Harry Potter===\n{{main|Harry Potter (character)}}\nWhen Voldemort attempted to murder Harry, he inadvertently sealed a fragment of his soul within him in a manner similar to a Horcrux. The event took place just before the opening chapter of ''Philosopher's Stone''. Rowling has explicitly stated that Harry never became a proper \"Dark object\" since the Horcrux spell was not cast.<ref name=\"pottercast166\" /> Regardless, as with all Horcruxes, Voldemort would remain immortal so long as his soul fragment remained within Harry.<ref>Rowling, J.K. (2007). ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'' (in English). New York City: Scholastic, et al. pp. 686. \"And while that fragment of soul, unmissed by Voldemort, remains attached to and protected by Harry, Lord Voldemort cannot die.\"</ref> That portion of Voldemort's soul is unintentionally destroyed by Voldemort himself at the close of the thirty-fourth chapter of ''Deathly Hallows'' with the help of the Elder Wand.\n\nAs a baby, Harry was in the room when Voldemort's fatal Killing Curse backfired. Voldemort's soul had been weakened and destabilised by his continuous murders and the creation of his previous Horcruxes. Harry became a Horcrux when a fragment of Voldemort's soul attached itself to him after the unsuccessful curse. The lightning bolt-shaped scar on Harry's forehead is a direct result of this attempted murder, and the connection that formed as a result is used to explain several important plot points. Throughout the series, Harry is able to receive insight into Voldemort's mental and emotional states, allowing the reader to [[Eavesdropping|eavesdrop]] on the series' primary antagonist. This insight is usually accompanied by pain in the scar on Harry's forehead. Through Voldemort, Harry also inherited the ability to speak and understand [[Magic (Harry Potter)#Parseltongue|Parseltongue]]. It is also revealed by Rowling in an interview that Harry's frequent pain in his scar when Voldemort is either active, nearby, or feeling strong emotions, is really the trapped bit of soul yearning to depart from Harry's body and rejoin its master's soul.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080917115036/http://pottercast.the-leaky-cauldron.org/transcript/show/166?ordernum=2 PotterCast 130: The One with JK Rowling Transcript Part 2 (16:09 - 32:17) (Archived copy; original  website no longer valid)] ''web.archive.org copy of pottercast.the-leaky-cauldron.org'', accessed 29 March 2020</ref>\n\nThis yearning was one of the reasons why the Killing Curse used by Voldemort on Harry in the [[Hogwarts#Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]] does destroy the fragment of Voldemort's soul within Harry, but only sends Harry's soul into a near-death state. Harry could return to his body despite being hit by the Killing Curse from the Elder Wand because Voldemort had used Harry's blood to regain his full strength in ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', and because the actual master of the Elder Wand, Draco Malfoy, had been defeated by Harry making Harry the new master of the Elder Wand. Harry's ownership of the wand used for the curse and the Horcrux-like connection between Voldemort and Harry diminished Voldemort's curse and protected Harry from irreversible death.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows|last=Rowling|first=Joanne Kathleen|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing, plc.|date=21 July 2007|isbn=0-545-01022-5|location=United Kingdom|pages=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/harrypotterdeath00rowl}}</ref>\n\nWhile Voldemort did learn of Harry's [[Telepathy|telepathic]] connection, Voldemort was never aware that Harry was inadvertently carrying a fragment of his soul. With this destroyed, the connections between the two were also broken, and Harry never again felt pain in his scar. Rowling revealed Harry has also lost the ability to speak Parseltongue, though he regained the ability to understand it in ''[[Harry Potter and the Cursed Child]]'' after his scar began to hurt again following the rise of Voldemort and Bellatrix's daughter Delphi whom Harry, his son Albus Severus, and his allies defeated and sent to Azkaban.<ref name=\"RowlingWeb2007\" /> In the epilogue of the film, the scar has faded to an ordinary looking scar on Harry's forehead.\n\n==Legendary magical artifacts==\n[[File:Goblet of Fire (Harry Potter movies).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.5|]]\n===Goblet of Fire===\nThe Goblet of Fire is a [[goblet]] made of wood and is used at the beginning of every [[Triwizard Tournament]]. It is used solely to choose the participating school champions, serving as an \"impartial judge.\"{{HP4}} Slips of parchment with the names of potential candidates are placed in the Goblet and, at the designated time, a representative from each school is chosen when the slip of parchment containing their name spouts forth from the Goblet in a fountain of magical fire. The fake Moody stated once that the Goblet of Fire was \"an exceptionally powerful magical object\" and it is very difficult to hoodwink, unless someone uses an exceptionally strong Confundus Charm.\n\nDuring its use in ''Goblet of Fire'', it is placed in the entrance hall and surrounded by an \"Age Line\", a charm placed by Dumbledore to prevent underage wizards from entering the tournament. Anyone underage would grow a long white beard, as the Weasley twins demonstrated when they attempted to fool the goblet with an Ageing Potion. When not in use, the Goblet is kept in a jeweled casket in Dumbledore's closet.\n\n===Godric Gryffindor's Sword===\n[[File:The Making of Harry Potter 29-05-2012 (Sword of Gryffindor).jpg|thumb]]\n<!-- [[Godric Gryffindor's Sword]], [[Godric Gryffindor's sword]], [[Gryffindor Sword]], [[Gryffindor's Sword]], [[Gryffindor's sword]], [[Sword of Godric Gryffindor]], and [[Sword of Gryffindor]], all redirect here -->\nThe Sword of Godric Gryffindor is a [[Goblin (Harry Potter)|goblin]]-made sword adorned with large rubies on the [[Pommel (sword)|pommel]]. It was once owned by [[Godric Gryffindor]], one of the medieval founders of [[Hogwarts]]. In ''Chamber of Secrets'', Harry draws the Sword out of the [[#Sorting Hat|Sorting Hat]] to battle and kill a [[Basilisk (Harry Potter)|Basilisk]]. When Dumbledore learns of Harry's concern that he does not belong in the House of Gryffindor, in part at being [[parseltongue]] like [[Lord Voldemort]], the headmaster is able to put the boy's concerns at ease by telling him only a true member of that house could have summoned that sword in his time of need. The sword also plays a key role in ''Deathly Hallows'', where it is revealed to have become imbued with Basilisk venom following its use against the Basilisk, as it \"only takes in that which makes it stronger\". It is subsequently used to destroy three of Voldemort's Horcruxes.\n\nBecause the Sword was goblin-forged, it is indestructible, and according to [[Griphook]] the goblin, the Sword was originally forged by the goblin Ragnuk the First and \"stolen\" by Gryffindor, as The Sword was taken by Griphook when the Sword fell from Harry's grasp during the raid on [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]'s vault in book seven. The sword returned to wizard hands, when Neville pulled it out of the Sorting Hat and used it to decapitate Nagini, Voldemort's snake. This shows that no matter where the sword happened to be at the time, it will reappear in the Hat when a true member of Gryffindor house is in need of it.<!-- Dumbledore makes it clear in ''Chamber of Secrets'' that only a true Gryffindor can summon the sword in this fashion. [See Above] -->\n\nRowling has confirmed <!-- in her webchat --> that Gryffindor did not steal the sword from Ragnuk and that this belief is merely part of Griphook's goblin mistrust and prejudice against wizards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2007/0730-bloomsbury-chat.html |title=Gryffindor did not 'steal' the sword, not unless you are a goblin fanatic and believe that all goblin-made objects really belong to the maker |publisher=Accio-quote.org |date=30 July 2007 |accessdate=25 November 2011}}</ref> <!-- It was revealed on Pottermore [Reference at end of paragraph] --> Godric Gryffindor commissioned Ragnuk the First to make the sword for him under his specifications. Once Ragnuk had made the sword, he was so fond of it that after he had presented it to Gryffindor, he told the goblins it had been stolen and sent minions to retrieve it for him. Gryffindor defeated the goblins using magic and instead of killing them, he bewitched them to go back to Ragnuk and say that if he tried to take the sword again, he would use it against them. The king took the threat seriously, but still insisted it had been stolen from him until the day he died.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pottermore.com/en/book2/chapter18/moment1/the-sword-of-gryffindor |title=Sword of Gryffindor |publisher=Pottermore |date=October 2012 |accessdate=5 January 2013}} {{Registration required}}</ref>\n\nIt is mentioned in the ''Deathly Hallows'' that the Sword of Gryffindor is supposed to be in Bellatrix Lestrange's vault, placed there by Severus Snape. Unknown to Bellatrix, that sword was only a replica.{{clarify|date=December 2014}}<!-- is it fake? this same paragraph makes it clear that Griphook lies --> When Harry, Ron and Hermione were captured and brought to the Malfoy Manor, she spotted the sword near one of the Snatchers, who intended to keep it. She killed him and forced the rest out of the room, then tortured Hermione for information about the sword. But at Harry's request, Griphook lied and said that the sword was a forgery. Bellatrix's reaction to having her vault possibly broken into convinced Harry that the Horcrux was also placed in her vault.\n\n===Philosopher's Stone===\n[[File:The Making of Harry Potter 29-05-2012 (Philosopher's stone).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|]]\nBased upon the ancient alchemical idea of the [[Philosopher's stone]], the stone is owned by [[Nicolas Flamel#In popular culture|Nicolas Flamel]] and first mentioned in ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]''. The stone is legendary in that it changes all metals to gold, and can be used to brew a potion called the [[Elixir of Life]], making the drinker immortal. The Philosopher's Stone is seen only in the first and last book, although it is referenced several times throughout the series. It was destroyed at the end of the first book by Dumbledore with Flamel's agreement.\n\nIn the American version, this stone is called the Sorcerer's Stone.\n\n===Sorting Hat===\n[[File:Wizarding World of Harry Potter - the sorting hat (5013545663).jpg|left|thumb|The Sorting Hat as seen on the queue for the theme park attraction, [[Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey]].]]\nThe Sorting Hat is a [[Sapience|sapient]] [[artifact (fantasy)|artefact]] used at Hogwarts, which uses Legilimency (essentially, the ability to read minds) to determine which of the four school houses \u2013 [[Gryffindor]], [[Hufflepuff]], [[Ravenclaw]] or [[Slytherin]] \u2013 each new student is to be assigned for their years at Hogwarts. The hat resembles a dilapidated conical leather wide-brimmed wizard's hat, with folds and tears that make it appear to have eyes and a mouth. During the opening banquet at the beginning of each school year, the Hat is placed on every first-year student's head. The Hat announces its choice aloud, and the student joins the selected house. The Hat speaks to the student while they're being sorted and is willing to take the student's preferences into account when it makes its decision. Sometimes it does not have the need to do so: for instance, the Hat barely touched Draco Malfoy's head before sending him to Slytherin. The Sorting Hat had a difficult time placing Harry, almost placing him into Slytherin house before he requested specifically and emphatically not to be. The Hat instead placed him into Gryffindor, the house of his parents. Rowling has stated the reason for the Hat's indecision as to which house to place him into was because it sensed the part of Voldemort's soul within Harry.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}<!-- if \"Rowling stated\" then that statement should be sourced -->\n\nThe Sorting Hat originally belonged to Godric Gryffindor, one of the four founders of Hogwarts. The four founders used to hand-pick the students for their houses, but then realised someone else would have to do it after they died, so Gryffindor took off his hat, enchanted it, and let it choose.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/the-sorting-hat|title=The Sorting Hat {{!}} Wizarding World|website=www.wizardingworld.com|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> Since then, the Sorting Hat has always been used to choose which house the students are put in. Due to its age, it appears \"patched and frayed and extremely dirty.\" Before Sorting the students each year, the hat recites a new introductory song. These songs occasionally warn of danger to come, as in ''Order of the Phoenix''. The Sorting Hat's songs vary in length and content, but always include a brief description of each house.\n\nThe Sorting Hat has shown the ability to conjure the Sword of Gryffindor from under its brim, as shown on two instances. Both times it is used to kill snakes; in ''Chamber of Secrets'', it provides the sword to Harry to kill the Basilisk, and in ''Deathly Hallows'', it delivers the sword to Neville. Dumbledore makes it clear in ''Chamber of Secrets'' that only a true Gryffindor can summon the sword in this fashion. In ''Deathly Hallows'' the Sorting Hat is set on fire by Voldemort, although it appears the hat was not destroyed, as Neville was able to draw the Sword of Gryffindor from it immediately after and behead Voldemort's snake Nagini. In the epilogue at the end of ''Deathly Hallows'', the Hat's survival is confirmed, as Harry tells his youngest son that the Hat would take his preference into consideration.\n\nAccording to Pottermore, a Hatstall is 'an archaic Hogwarts term for any new student whose Sorting takes longer than five minutes. This is an exceptionally long time for the Sorting Hat to deliberate, and occurs rarely, perhaps once every 50 years. Of Harry Potter's contemporaries, Hermione Granger and Neville Longbottom came closest to being Hatstalls. The Sorting Hat spent nearly four minutes trying to decide whether it should place Hermione in Ravenclaw or Gryffindor. In Neville's case, the Hat was determined to place him in Gryffindor: Neville, intimidated by that house's reputation for bravery, requested a placing in Hufflepuff. Their silent wrangling resulted in triumph for the Hat.'<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rowling|first1=J.K.|title=Hatstall|url=https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/hatstall|website=Pottermore|accessdate=7 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nRowling has stated on Pottermore that 'The Sorting Hat is notorious for refusing to admit it has made a mistake in its sorting of a student. On those occasions when Slytherins behave altruistically or selflessly, when Ravenclaws flunk all their exams, when Hufflepuffs prove lazy yet academically gifted and when Gryffindors exhibit cowardice, the Hat steadfastly backs its original decision. On balance, however, the Hat has made remarkably few errors of judgement over the many centuries it has been at work.'<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/the-sorting-hat |title=The Sorting Hat |publisher=Pottermore |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2016-12-28}}</ref>\n\nIn the ''Harry Potter'' films, the Sorting Hat is voiced by actor [[Leslie Phillips]].<!-- in the first, second, and eighth films, no other actors http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0001041/ -->\n\n==Mirrors==\n===The Mirror of Erised===\n[[File:Mirror of Erised (28731124264).jpg|thumb]]\nThe Mirror of Erised is a mystical mirror discovered by Harry in an abandoned classroom in ''<!--do not change to \"Sorcerer's\"-->Philosopher's<!--do not change to \"Sorcerer's\"--> Stone''. On it is inscribed \"erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi\". When mirrored and correctly spaced, this reads \"I show not your face but your heart's desire.\" As \"erised\" reversed is \"desire,\" it is the \"Mirror of Desire.\" Harry, upon encountering the Mirror, can see his parents, as well as what appears to be a crowd of relatives; Ron sees himself as Head Boy and Quidditch Captain holding the House Cup, thus revealing his wish to escape from the shadow of his highly successful older brothers, as well as his more popular friend, Harry. Dumbledore cautions Harry that the Mirror gives neither knowledge nor truth, merely showing the viewer's deepest desire, and that men have wasted their lives away before it, entranced by what they see.\n\nDumbledore, one of the few other characters to face the Mirror in the novel, claims to see himself holding a pair of socks he always wanted, telling Harry that \"one can never have enough socks,\" and lamenting that he did not receive any for Christmas, since people will insist on giving him books. However, Harry suspects that this is not true, and it is suggested in ''Deathly Hallows'' that what he really sees is his entire family alive, well and happy together again, much like Harry.<ref>{{cite web|author=Melissa |url=http://the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/7/30/j-k-rowling-web-chat-transcript |title=J.K.

Dumbledore hid the Mirror and hid the Stone inside it, knowing that only a person who wanted to find but not use the Stone would be able to obtain it. Anyone else would see him or herself making an Elixir of Life or turning things to gold, rather than actually finding the Stone, and would be unable to obtain it. What happens to the mirror afterwards is unknown.\n\n===Two-way mirrors===\nIn ''Order of the Phoenix'', Sirius gives Harry a mirror he originally used to communicate with James while they were in separate detentions. That mirror is a part of a set of ''Two-way Mirrors'' that are activated by holding one of them and saying the name of the other possessor, causing his or her face to appear on the caller's mirror and vice versa. Harry receives this mirror from Sirius in a package after spending his Christmas holiday at [[Grimmauld Place]]. Harry, at first, chooses not to open the package, although he does discover the mirror after Sirius' death, by which point it is no longer functional. It makes its second appearance in ''Deathly Hallows'' when [[Mundungus Fletcher]] loots Grimmauld Place and sells Sirius' mirror to [[Aberforth Dumbledore]], who uses it to watch out for Harry in ''Deathly Hallows''. When Harry desperately cries for help to a shard of the magical mirror (which broke in the bottom of his trunk), a brilliant blue eye belonging to Aberforth (which Harry mistakes for Albus' eye), appears and he sends [[Dobby the house elf|Dobby]], who arrives to help Harry escape from [[Malfoy Manor]] to [[Shell Cottage]].\n\n==Prank objects==\n===Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes===\n{{Main|Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes}}\nPrank objects from Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes are made and designed by the owners of the shop, Fred and George, who test their new creations on themselves and other Hogwarts students.\n* Weasley's Wild-fire Whiz-Bangs are enchanted fireworks that have overly spectacular and remarkable effects.\n* Skiving Snackboxes are sweets that are designed to make the eater temporarily ill in order to skip or \"skive off\" class. Each variety of Snackboxes causes a different effect, such as vomiting, fainting or developing nosebleeds. One end of the sweet causes the malady, while the other end subsequently cures it. The snackboxes include: Nosebleed Nougat, Fever Fudge, Fainting Fancies, Blood Blisterpods and Puking Pastilles.\n* Patented Daydream Charms are kits that put the user into a realistic 30-minute daydream which they imagine, and can easily be customised so as to be fitted into any lesson.\n* A Headless Hat creates a limited field of invisibility that covers the wearer's head, giving him or her the appearance of not having a head. Its counterpart is a Shield Hat, which deflects minor hexes and curses. Though Fred and George design the Shield Hat to be a trick item, Ministry officials are impressed by its practical value and order 500 of them for protection of the Aurors. Shield Cloaks and Shield Gloves are also on sale following the Shield Hat's success.\n* Trick Wands are magical fake wands that turn into a silly item (rubber chickens, tin parrots, etc.) when someone tries to use them. More expensive varieties beat the unwary user about the head and neck.\n* Ton-Tongue Toffees make the eater's tongue temporarily grow to an alarmingly large size, as read about in ''Goblet of Fire'' when Fred \"accidentally\" drops some in front of Dudley, who subsequently eats one they \"forgot\" to retrieve.\n* Canary Creams make the eater turn briefly into a large [[Domestic Canary|canary]]; when the effect wears off, the person molts and returns to normal.\n* U-No-Poo causes the consumer to have constipation, or as Fred and George refer to it: \"The constipation sensation that's gripping the nation.\" Its name is a play on \"You-Know-Who\", commonly used to refer to Voldemort.\n* Extendable Ears are long flesh-coloured strings, one end of which is inserted into a user's ear and the other end placed further away towards a conversation or sound. Much like a listening device, the user will be able to hear the sounds as if they were much closer to the source. They were first introduced by Fred and George Weasley in ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', when they used the ears to listen to the Order's meetings, until one was destroyed (and eaten) by Crookshanks.\n* Portable Swamps are, as the name suggests, realistic pop-up swamps. They were first seen in ''Order of the Phoenix'' after Umbridge is renamed Headmistress. Fred and George set one off in a corridor, partly as a distraction for Umbridge so Harry can use her fireplace, and partly to just cause general mayhem. They seem to be reasonably difficult to remove: Umbridge cannot remove it and forces Filch to punt students across, while Professor Flitwick vanishes it almost instantly later on in the novel. (He leaves a small patch untouched as a tribute to Fred and George, who have left Hogwarts by this point.)\n* Decoy Detonators are described as black horn type objects that will run out of sight, and make a noise giving the user a good distraction. Introduced in ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]''. First used by Harry while breaking into Dolores Umbridge's office at the Ministry of Magic in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]''.\n*Guaranteed Ten-Second Pimple Vanisher\n*Pygmy Puffs (miniature Puffskeins)\n*Edible Dark Marks\n\nThere are also prank items which the Weasleys import from elsewhere, such as:\n\n*Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder, which throws an area into darkness that cannot be penetrated by wandlight or any magical means, although the effect wears off in a few minutes. Draco Malfoy uses it to avoid members of Dumbledore's Army in ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]]''. It is also used in the ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Half-Blood Prince]]'' film by Harry in order to gain access to the luggage space above Draco Malfoy's table on the [[Hogwarts Express]].\n\n===Zonko's Joke Shop===\n[[Zonko's|Zonko's Joke Shop]] was a favorite place for Hogwarts students to shop on Hogsmeade trips. It carried \"jokes and tricks to fulfill even Fred and George's wildest dreams.\" Such products include Hiccough (Hiccup) Sweets, Frog Spawn Soap, and Nose-Biting Teacups. Fred and George tried to buy the place to expand their shop in Hogsmeade during Harry's sixth year, but they turned it down due to the dark times coming up.\n\n===Other prank objects===\nOther prank objects include Belch Powder,<ref name=\"PA8\">{{HPref|book=3|chapter=8}}</ref> Dungbombs (which explode and cause a large and extremely smelly mess), and Ever-Bashing Boomerangs (which hit their target repeatedly after being thrown). Fanged Frisbees are quite literally normal Frisbees with fangs and are first mentioned in ''Goblet of Fire'' as one of Filch's newest restricted items during Dumbledore's start-of-term speech. However, they make their first appearance in ''Half-Blood Prince'' when Ron whirled one around the Gryffindor common room, it changed course with a mind of its own, and took a bite out of a tapestry. Most of these objects are banned at Hogwarts due to the possibility of injury.\n\nMore objects include Screaming Yo-Yos, which scream very loudly when worked, and Stink Pellets, which are used to distract prefects and teachers, and give a most unpleasant smell.<ref name=\"PA8\"/>\n\n==Storage receptacles==\n===Hermione's handbag===\nIn ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', Hermione used an Undetectable Extension Charm on her beaded handbag, significantly enlarging the bag's internal dimensions without affecting its physical size. As well, the [[mass]] of the objects placed in her handbag is negated, making the bag easy to carry. Bags similar to this appear in other contexts, such as the \"[[bag of holding]]\" in Dungeons and Dragons or the \"[[magic satchel]]\" in many other games. [[Mary Poppins]] also seems to have a handbag of similar uses. Hermione uses it to carry everything they need when they travel across the United Kingdom on their hunt for Horcruxes.\n\n===Mokeskin pouch===\nMokeskin pouches are a type of draw-string pouch that can be operated only by the owner. Harry receives one as his 17th birthday present from Hagrid, using it to store several items of personal significance, such as the Golden Snitch, his broken wand, the false locket, the shard of Sirius' mirror and the Marauders' map.\n\n===Moody's Magical Trunk===\n[[File:The Making of Harry Potter 29-05-2012 (7386427778).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|]]\n[[Alastor Moody]] owns a strangely bewitched magical trunk. It has seven locks on it, and the trunk opens to a different assortment of objects for each lock. Most notably, though, the seventh compartment is about {{convert|10|ft|m|0}} deep (possibly because of the use of an Undetectable Extension Charm), and is where Barty Crouch Jr. imprisoned the real Moody. Other compartments contain spellbooks, Dark Detectors, and Moody's Invisibility Cloak.\n\n===Pensieve===\n[[Image:The Making of Harry Potter 29-05-2012 (7375511988).jpg|thumb|]] A Pensieve is a stone basin used to review memories. Covered in mystic runes, it contains memories whose physical form is neither gas nor liquid. A witch or wizard can extract their own or another's memories, store them in the Pensieve, and review them later. It also relieves the mind when it becomes cluttered with information. Anyone can examine the memories in the Pensieve, which also allows viewers to fully immerse themselves in the memories stored within, much like a magical form of [[virtual reality]].\n\nUsers of these devices view the memories from a [[Third-person narrative|third-person-point-of-view]], providing a near-[[omniscient]] perspective of the events preserved. Rowling confirmed memories in the Pensieve allow one to view details of things that happened even if they did not notice or remember them, and stated \"that's the magic of the Pensieve, what brings it alive.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mugglenet.com/jkrinterview3.shtml |title=MuggleNet Emerson and Melissa's J.K. Rowling Interview Page 3 |publisher=Mugglenet.com |date=16 July 2005 |accessdate=25 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110122257/http://www.mugglenet.com/jkrinterview3.shtml |archivedate=10 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The memories contained in the Pensieve have the appearance of silver threads. Memories that have deteriorated due to age, or that were heavily manipulated or tampered with to alter perspectives (such as Slughorn's), may appear thick and jelly-like and offer obscured viewing. Memories are not limited to just those of humans, since [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Hokey|Hokey]] the house-elf provided Dumbledore with a memory as well. It makes its last appearance in ''Deathly Hallows'' when Harry uses it to uncover the truth about Snape.\n\nIn [[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|the fourth film]], the Pensieve in Dumbledore's office conforms to the description given in the novel. However, in [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|the sixth]] and [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2|eighth films]], it appears as a shallow metal dish, floating in midair and filled with a [[mercury (element)|mercury]]-like liquid. During the eighth film, Harry removes it from the stone basin so he can use it to examine Snape's memories.\n\n==Transportation==\n===Arthur Weasley's Magic Ford Anglia===\n[[File:Harry Potter car.jpg|thumb]]\n[[Arthur Weasley]] owned a 1960 [[Ford Anglia|Ford Anglia 105E]] that he subsequently enchanted; consequently, the [[flying car (fiction)|vehicle can fly]], become invisible, and carry the entire Weasley family in spite of its formerly non-enchanted interior dimensions (also the Undetectable Extension Charm), among other abilities. In ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'', the car is borrowed by Fred, George and Ron, who use it to rescue Harry from the Dursleys' house. Ron and Harry later steal the car in order to return to Hogwarts after the gate to [[Platform 9\u00be]] is sealed by Dobby. After they arrive at school, landing in the Whomping Willow, the car ejects Harry, Ron, and their luggage, then flees into the [[Hogwarts#Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]], ignoring Ron's pleas for it to come back. Mr Weasley soon faces an [[inquiry]] at the Ministry of Magic, as seven [[Muggle]]s saw the car flying across the countryside, and is forced to pay a large fine.\n\nThe car reappears when Harry and Ron visit [[Aragog]] in the forest: when the great spider's colony of acromantula attempt to devour Harry and Ron, the car attacks the spiders and carries the boys to safety. The car does not return to the Weasleys despite saving Ron and Harry, instead re-entering the forest to remain on its own. The car's current condition is undisclosed; Ron had commented that the enchanted vehicle had become \"wild\" and thus operated autonomously, like a wild animal. In theory, it might still exist when the characters' children attend Hogwarts.\n\nThe 1962 Ford Anglia used in the film was acquired by [[Rupert Grint]], who plays Ron Weasley, and is currently displayed in the [[National Motor Museum, Beaulieu]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.beaulieu.co.uk/attractions/on-screen-cars |title=On Screen Cars &#124; Beaulieu, New Forest |publisher=Beaulieu.co.uk |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2017-03-01}}</ref> A total of 14 Ford Anglias were destroyed during the filming of the scene where the car crashes into the Whomping Willow.\n\nA replica of the car in its feral state can be seen in the queue line for the [[Dragon Challenge]] roller coaster at the [[Islands of Adventure|Universal Studios Islands of Adventure]] theme park. Occasionally it blinks its headlights and honks its horn when its motion detectors sense that guests are standing in front of it or walking by it.\n\n===Broomsticks===\n[[File:The Making of Harry Potter 29-05-2012 (Broomsticks).jpg|thumb]]\n[[Besom broom|Broomstick]]s are used for transportation by witches and wizards of all ages, and for participating in the game of Quidditch. Their use is similar to that of [[#Flying carpets|flying carpets]], although the latter are banned in Great Britain by the Ministry of Magic. However, they are uncomfortable for extended trips, even with a cushion charm applied, and thus many wizards favour other means of transport for those journeys.\n\nBroomsticks are treated as a major consumer product in the [[Harry Potter Universe|wizarding world]]. There are numerous manufacturers and models of brooms, including ''Cleansweeps'' and ''Comets'', all of which vary in their capabilities. These range from expensive high-performance models to toy broomsticks for young children that fly only a few feet off the ground to family-sized broomsticks that seat multiple people and include a luggage compartment below the seating area.\n\nSince Harry plays Quidditch, his broomsticks - a ''Nimbus 2000'' and later a ''Firebolt'' - are prominent in the series. The ''Nimbus 2000'' was given to him by special consent of [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] via [[Minerva McGonagall]], who had chosen him as the [[Gryffindor]] Seeker.{{HP1}} The ''Firebolt'' was given to him by his godfather [[Sirius Black]] as a Christmas gift after his ''Nimbus'' was destroyed by the Whomping Willow tree during a Quidditch match.{{HP3}} The ''Firebolt'' remains the fastest broom in the world, having surpassed the previous record holder, the ''Nimbus 2001'' (which Draco Malfoy owns and which his father [[Lucius Malfoy]] had given as gifts to the entire [[Slytherin]] team as a bribe to have Draco as their Seeker). The price of the ''Firebolt'' is so high it is only available upon request.{{HP3}}\n\n===Floo Powder===\n[[Image:Floopowder.jpg|thumb|left|Floo Powder as seen in [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]]' film adaptation of ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]''.]]\nFloo Powder is a glittering powder used by wizards to travel and communicate using fireplaces. It was invented by Ignatia Wildsmith (1227\u20131320) and named after the [[flue]], which is the passageway that leads from a fireplace to the chimney and allows hot gases to escape.\n\nFloo powder can be used with any fireplace connected to the Floo Network. To transport from one to another, the fire at the point of departure must first be lit. The traveler throws a handful of Floo powder into the flames, turning them emerald green, then steps into the fireplace and states the intended destination in a clear and purposeful voice. Floo powder can also be used for communication; a wizard or witch can kneel in front of the fireplace and stick their head into the fire, which will then appear in the fire of the destination fireplace, leaving the witch or wizard free to talk. It is also known that other body parts may be transported via Floo Powder, as Umbridge almost catches Sirius the second time he converses with Harry through the Floo network. Voices can also be transmitted through the Floo Network, as seen in the ''Prisoner of Azkaban'' by Snape, who summons Lupin through his office's fireplace while interrogating Harry about the Marauder's Map.\n\nIn ''Chamber of Secrets'', the Weasleys travel to [[Diagon Alley]] using Floo Powder. Harry did not say \"Diagon Alley\" clearly enough due to coughing in the fire's smoke and ashes, so he was sent to Borgin and Burkes in [[Knockturn Alley]]. In the fourth book, Mr. Weasley uses his position at the Ministry to have the Dursleys' fireplace temporarily connected to the Floo Network, unaware that it had been blocked up. Sirius uses the network to communicate with Harry in the same book. In the fifth book, Harry uses the Gryffindor fireplace and later Umbridge's fireplace to communicate with Sirius; he is forced to use the latter because Umbridge begins monitoring all other lines of communication in and out of Hogwarts.\n\nThe Floo Network is controlled by the Ministry of Magic. The Ministry also has over 700 fireplaces in its headquarters so that officials and workers can go directly to/from work without the hustle and bustle of travelling on brooms or by Portkey - or the indignity of having to flush themselves in through a public toilet, as portrayed in ''Deathly Hallows''.\n\nAccording to [[Pottermore]], the only licensed producer of Floo Powder in Britain is Floo-Pow, a company whose Headquarters is located in Diagon Alley. No shortage of Floo Powder has ever been reported, nor does anybody know anyone who makes it. Its price has remained constant for one hundred years: two Sickles a scoop.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rowling|first1=J.K.|title=Floo Powder|url=https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/floo-powder|website=Pottermore|accessdate=7 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Flying carpets===\nFlying carpets are rugs, that are enchanted with the ability to fly. Flying Carpets were once an accepted form of travel for the British magical community, but they are banned due to being defined as a Muggle Artefact<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/artifact |title=Dictionary.reference.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |accessdate=25 November 2011}}</ref> by the Registry of Proscribed Charmable Objects. It is therefore against British wizarding law to charm carpets or fly them, although they are still legal in other countries. Mr. Weasley was heavily involved in the introduction of this legislation due to his position in the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts office. It is revealed that the ban was relatively recent, not only due to Mr. Weasley's involvement, but also because Barty Crouch's grandfather owned and operated a 12-seater [[Axminster carpet|Axminster]] before flying carpets were prohibited.\n\n===Hogwarts Express===\n{{Main|Hogwarts Express}}\nThe Hogwarts Express is the train which transports Hogwarts students to and from the school at the beginning and end of each term. It also transports willing students home for the Christmas holidays. It is stationed in Hogsmeade when not in use, and it can be accessed only by using [[Platform 9 3/4|the magical wall between the platforms 9 and 10]].\n\n===Knight Bus===\n[[File:The Knight Bus, Wizarding World of Harry Potter, Universal Studios Orlando, 12 October 2014.jpg|thumb|300px|The Knight Bus, seen in the [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'' film]], at [[Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden]].]]\nThe Knight Bus is a heavily enchanted purple [[triple-decker]] Regent Three class bus that transports witches and wizards. It is hailed just like in hitchhiking, but instead of the thumb, the wizard has to hold his wand hand out to hail the Knight Bus. It makes its first appearance in ''Prisoner of Azkaban'' when Harry unintentionally hails it by throwing out his wand arm to break his fall after a stumble. Harry has a final ride on the Knight Bus with a number of his friends in ''Order of the Phoenix''. The Knight Bus is faster than travelling by broomstick, but not as fast as near instantaneous [[#Floo Powder|Floo Powder]] and [[Apparating]]. The bus charges for the service based on distance; Harry is charged a base fare of 11 Sickles to travel from [[Little Whinging]] to [[The Leaky Cauldron (pub)|The Leaky Cauldron]]. Amenities such as hot-water bottles, toothbrushes, and hot chocolate are available for a small additional fee.{{HP3}}\n\nThe bus functions as a convenient form of public transportation for the wizard or witch who cannot or will not choose another means of transportation. The riders are seemingly picked up by the bus from all over in-universe Great Britain, bringing passengers to the destinations of their choice with seemingly no set route. It bolts through the streets entirely invisible to Muggles and causes other objects to dodge it (instead of the other way around) for short distance-travel. For longer distances, the Knight Bus makes hundred-mile (160&nbsp;km) leaps, accompanied by a great bang and jolt. The interior of the bus changes depending on the time of day, having seats by day and beds by night. It is also highly uncomfortable, according to Ron and Harry. Its only mentioned limitation in travelling is that it is unable to voyage through water.\n\nThe [[Conductor (transportation)|conductor]] of the Knight Bus is [[Stan Shunpike]], and its driver is Ernie Prang. In the third film, Ernie is accompanied by a talking [[shrunken head]] [[voice actor|voiced]] by [[Lenny Henry]].\n\nAs revealed on [[Pottermore]], the Knight Bus was first commissioned in 1865 as a method for underage or infirm wizards to transport themselves discreetly. The idea was proposed by then-Minister of Magic Dugald McPhail, after a number of other ideas such as broomsticks with sidecars were vetoed, taking inspiration from the then-relatively-new bus service.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rowling|first1=J.K.|title=The Knight Bus|url=https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/the-knight-bus|website=Pottermore|accessdate=7 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe actual Knight Bus seen in the film adaptation was built by grafting the top deck of a London [[AEC Regent III RT]] bus onto the top of another \"RT\" bus. Both buses were originally built for [[History of public transport authorities in London|London Transport]]; the \"RT\" was the standard London diesel-powered double-decker bus of which approximately 4,000 were built from 1939 until the mid-1950s (and were used in daily service until 1979). The actual bus used was RT3882 (registration LLU681), with the additional top deck from former RT2240 (registration KGU169). Parts of RT 4497 (OLD 717) were also used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countrybus.org/RT/RT4_4.htm |title=Countrybus.org |publisher=Countrybus.org |accessdate=25 November 2011}}</ref> A replica of the Knight Bus sits in front of the London facade at [[The Wizarding World of Harry Potter (Universal Orlando Resort)|The Wizarding World of Harry Potter]] in [[Universal Studios Florida]], serving as a stage for a small audience-interactive show with a Stan Shunpike look-alike and a shrunken head.\n\n===Portkeys===\nPortkeys are first mentioned in ''Goblet of Fire'' by Mr. Weasley. They are an alternative to Apparation but can also be used to transport a group of people at once. Created by using the Portus spell, a Portkey can be set to transport anybody who touches it to a designated location or to become active at a predetermined time and transport itself and anyone touching to its set destination.<ref name=\"HP4-p69\"/> It may be created for one-way, one-time use or to transport the holder to and from a particular place in a round trip; in addition, it may be set to activate at a particular time or automatically transport the first person who touches it. The creation of Portkeys is highly restricted and controlled by the Department of Magical Transport, Portkey office. Cornelius Fudge objects to Dumbledore spontaneously creating one, stating that Dumbledore hasn't got authorisation; and at one point in chapter 3, Lupin says, \"...&nbsp;it's more than our life's worth to set up an unauthorised Portkey.\"<ref>{{HP5}}, \"The Advance Guard\", p. 51{{clarify|date=March 2020}}</ref>\n\nAny object can be used as a Portkey; it is common practise to select old, worthless items, to discourage unsuspecting Muggles from picking them up and activating them.<ref>{{HP4}}, \"The Portkey\", p.66{{clarify|date=March 2020}}</ref> Portkey objects used in the Potter series include a football and an old Wellington [boot]. Once the Portus charm is cast upon an object, it glows blue and vibrates gently; once settled it has become a Portkey. When Portkeys are activated, users feel the sensation of a hook being jerked from behind their navel. The floor disappears from beneath their feet, leaving their last position behind them, and they fly forward through a whirlwind of colour and sound, appearing suddenly at their destination.<ref name=\"HP4-p69\">{{HP4}}, \"The Portkey\", p.69{{clarify|date=March 2020}}</ref> With enough practice it is possible to achieve a graceful landing: After the Portkey trip to the [[Quidditch World Cup]] in the fourth film, Mr. Weasley, [[Cedric Diggory|Cedric]] and [[Amos Diggory]] land on their feet, while the less experienced teenagers, including Harry, fall on the ground.\n\nA Portkey plays an important role in the climax of ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]''. At the end of the Triwizard Tournament, the Triwizard Cup is revealed to have been turned into a Portkey by Barty Crouch Junior and it transports Harry Potter and Cedric Diggory to a graveyard where Cedric is killed and Voldemort regains physical form. Prompted by his parents, Harry later uses the Portkey to escape with Cedric's body back to Hogwarts.\n\n===Sirius Black's Enchanted Motorbike===\n[[File:The Making of Harry Potter 29-05-2012 (7386852396).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|]]\n[[Sirius Black]] owned a flying motorbike, which he lent to Hagrid the night Harry's parents died. It is first seen when Hagrid delivers the baby Harry to Number 4, Privet Drive in the first book, and then again when Hagrid uses it to transport Harry to a safe house in the seventh volume. In ''Deathly Hallows'', various modifications have been made to the bike by Mr. Weasley, allowing it to create a brick wall or a net that erupts from the exhaust pipe and to shoot dragon fire from the exhaust, impelling the bike's sudden acceleration. The dragon-fire feature is used to great effect by Hagrid and Harry when being chased by Voldemort; however, Mr. Weasley did warn that he was unsure of its safety and that they should use it only in an emergency. He was right to say this, as the sidecar of the motorbike, unaffected by Hagrid's magic dislodged after the abrupt acceleration.\n\nThe bike is severely damaged when, with Hagrid and Harry aboard, it crashes into [[Ted Tonks|Ted]] and [[Andromeda Tonks]]' garden pond. Mr. Weasley covertly tells Harry that he plans to put the bike back together when \"he has time\", meaning when Mrs. Weasley is distracted or has forgotten about it. He hides it in the chicken coop and manages to repair it, giving it to Harry between the end of ''Deathly Hallows'' and the epilogue. The bike is now still in Harry's possession, but he doesn't use it.\n\n===Time-Turners===\n[[File:Giratemps.jpg|thumb]]\nA Time-Turner may be used for short-term [[time travel]]. Hermione receives a Time-Turner from McGonagall in ''Prisoner of Azkaban'', enabling her to attend more than one class simultaneously. Hermione is ordered to keep it a secret from everyone, including Harry and Ron, although they do notice the suspicious impossibility of her schedule and several bizarre disappearances and reappearances. Hermione lets Harry and Ron in on the secret near the end of the book, when she and Harry use the Time-Turner to save [[Sirius Black]] and [[Buckbeak]]. Feeling the strain from her heavy course load, she finally returns the device to McGonagall at the end of the novel. In the film version, however, only McGonagall, Dumbledore and Harry knew of Hermione's possession of her time-turner, as Ron witnessed Harry and Hermione repeatedly travelling back in time in the infirmary, but seeing them back together moments later near the end of the film.\n\nA large supply of Time-Turners is kept at the Ministry, as seen in ''Order of the Phoenix''; however, during the events of that book, a glass-fronted cabinet containing the Time-Turners is destroyed. Due to their time-affecting properties, the cabinet is seen to fall, shatter and repair itself repeatedly. In ''Half-Blood Prince'', Hermione quotes an article in ''[[The Daily Prophet]]'' which stated that \"the entire stock of Ministry Time-Turners\" was destroyed during that incident. The books do not discuss who else may be in possession of Time-Turners outside of the Ministry. Time-Turners are very dangerous when in the wrong hands, as it's said that many wizards met their demise after confronting and accidentally killing their own selves from the future so they are issued very carefully.\n\nHermione's Time-Turner resembles a gold [[hourglass]] pendant on a necklace; it is unclear if all of them do. The user twists the hourglass pendant, with the number of twists corresponding to the number of hours of back travel required.<ref name=\"PA21\">{{HPref|book=3|chapter=21}}</ref>\n\nTime-Turners are a significant point device in ''Cursed Child'', where it is revealed that a principle known as Croaker's Law restricts all legal Time-Turners to travelling a maximum of five hours into the past (any longer would create ripple effects that would harm either the time traveller or time itself) \u2013 although it is widely rumoured that Draco Malfoy's son Scorpius is the son of Lord Voldemort and that Scorpius' mother used a Time-Turner to make this possible.  An illegal Time-Turner capable of travelling back years is confiscated from a Dark wizard by the Ministry of Magic (although official word remains that all Time-Turners are destroyed) and is later stolen by Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy, who intend to travel back in time to prevent the death of Cedric Diggory.  Unfortunately, they quickly discover the Time-Turner is a cheaply made prototype that only takes them back for five minutes before forcibly returning them to the present. After accidentally creating (and then undoing) an [[Alternate history|alternate reality]] where Voldemort survived and took over the world, Albus and Scorpius resolve to destroy the Time-Turner, but are forced into another time trip by the story's villain and are left trapped in the past when the Time-Turner is destroyed.  Back in the present, Draco reveals he possesses a professionally made Time-Turner (bound by neither Croaker's Law nor the five-minute flaw) - he never admitted its existence for fear it would lend credence to the rumours surrounding his son and never used it (despite being tempted by the possibility of seeing his dead wife alive again).  When Albus and Scorpius are able to send a message to their parents, Draco's Time-Turner is used to rescue the boys.\n\n===Vanishing Cabinet===\nThe Vanishing Cabinet is a cabinet located in the [[Room of Requirement]] at Hogwarts that is a part of a set of two. The other cabinet resides in [[Borgin and Burkes]]. If used properly, a person who steps into one of the cabinets will instantly emerge from the other.\n\nThe Vanishing Cabinet is first seen in ''Chamber of Secrets'' when Harry hides in it to elude the Malfoys after accidentally traveling to Borgin and Burkes via the Floo Network; its transportation features are not activated as he does not shut the Cabinet completely. Its Hogwarts counterpart is also mentioned in ''Chamber of Secrets'' when [[Nearly Headless Nick]] persuades [[Peeves]] the Poltergeist to drop it (thus breaking it) over Filch's office in order to help Harry escape detention for tracking in [[mud]]. It was also used in ''Order of the Phoenix'' by Fred and George when they forced Montague, the [[Slytherin]] Quidditch captain and member of the Inquisitorial Squad, into it when he tried to take house points from Gryffindor. Draco then learns of Montague's experience, discovering transportation is possible between the two Cabinets and the other is located in Borgin and Burkes. In ''Half-Blood Prince'' he manages to fix the broken one at Hogwarts so as to transport the Death Eaters into the highly secured castle.\n\nThough this set is the only one mentioned in the book series, the film version of ''Half-Blood Prince'' reveals that they were popular when Voldemort first came to power, as they would allow people to make a quick getaway from Voldemort and his Death Eaters in an emergency.\n\n==Writing equipment==\n===Anti-Cheating Quill===\nThe Anti-Cheating Quill, a quill with an anti-cheating charm on it, first mentioned in ''Philosopher's Stone''.{{PStone|16}} In book five they are assigned to every O.W.L. student \u2013 and presumably those taking other exams \u2013 in order to prevent students from cheating in their written exams.\n\n===Auto-Answer Quill===\nThe Auto-Answer Quill is a quill that has been bewitched so that when the quill touches a question on a piece of parchment it writes the answer instantly. The quill is banned from the O.W.L. Examinations and the inks are checked out every time the test is on.{{OotP|31}}\n\n===Blood Quill===\nThe Blood Quill is a torture quill used by Umbridge throughout the ''Order of the Phoenix'' to punish students that she has given detention. It is described as having an unusually sharp black nib. As the user writes, the quill magically and very painfully cuts into the back of the user's hand and uses his or her blood for ink. In the fifth book, Harry has detention with Umbridge on several occasions; he is required to write lines (''I must not tell lies'') and is not released from this until Umbridge believes \"the message has sunk in.\" When carried out repeatedly over an extended period, this leads to permanent scarring, as Harry shows Scrimgeour in the last two books. The scars tingle whenever Harry hears Umbridge's name, but it is not clear whether this is psychological or akin to Harry's forehead scar hurting whenever Voldemort is active. Another victim of this form of detention is Lee Jordan; in the film adaptation of the book, members of [[Dumbledore's Army]] are forced to use these quills as well. Blood quills are considered illegal to own.\n\n===The Quill of Acceptance===\nAccording to [[Pottermore]], the Quill of Acceptance is a magical object which detects the birth of a child with magical capabilities. It is located in Hogwarts School, where it records the children's names in a large book. Professor McGonagall consults the book and sends out the subsequent Hogwarts acceptance letters by owl once the child turns eleven. It has been made very popular due to its use in registering users for the closed beta of Pottermore.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/the-quill-of-acceptance-and-the-book-of-admittance |title=The Quill of Acceptance and The Book of Admittance |publisher=Pottermore |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2016-12-28}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=June 2017}}\n\n===Quick Quotes Quill===\nA Quick Quotes Quill is a stenographic tool, acid green in colour, employed by Rita Skeeter to spin the words of her subjects into a more salacious or melodramatic form. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', Skeeter uses the quill to interview Harry about his participation in the Triwizard Tournament for her column in ''The Daily Prophet''. Harry continually tries to alert her to the inaccuracy of the quill; however, she continually ignores him. Additionally, in ''Deathly Hallows'', Rita mentions in her ''Daily Prophet'' interview concerning her posthumous biography of Dumbledore that her Quick Quotes Quill helped her to write the book so quickly after his death.\n\n===Spell-Checking Quill===\nThe Spell-Checking Quill temporarily corrects spelling as the user writes; however, once the charm wears off it constantly misspells words, even if the user writes them correctly. The most notable example is its misspelling of Ron's name as \"Roonil Wazlib\" in ''Half-Blood Prince''. It is sold through Weasley's Wizard Wheezes, the joke shop opened by Fred and George Weasley.\n\n==Other uncategorised objects==\nThese objects remain uncategorised as they are the only ones in their field.\n\n===Cauldron===\n[[File:The Making of Harry Potter 29-05-2012 (7528757868).jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|]]\n[[Cauldrons]] are magical receptacles in which [[Potions in Harry Potter|potions]] are brewed. They can be bought at the [[Places in Harry Potter#Cauldron Shop|Cauldron Shop]] in Diagon Alley. There are many different sizes and materials for cauldrons; Hogwarts asks students to buy a simple pewter size 2 cauldron, though in the first book Harry expresses a longing for one of pure gold.\n\nIn ''Goblet of Fire'', [[Percy Weasley]] writes a report on cauldrons for his new Ministry job in the hope that it will push regulation of the thickness of cauldron bottoms, as he believes foreign imports are a safety risk.\n\n===Gubraithian fire===\nGubraithian Fire is an everlasting magical fire that may only be created by extremely skilled wizards. Hagrid and [[Madame Maxime]] gave a bundle of Gubraithian fire, conjured by Dumbledore, as a gift to the Gurg (leader) of the [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Giants|giants]] during their attempts to sway them to Dumbledore's side.{{HP5}}\n\n===Omnioculars===\nOmnioculars are a pair of magical brass [[binoculars]] used by Harry, Ron and Hermione in the fourth book during the Quidditch World Cup. Omnioculars, besides having the magnification capabilities of binoculars, have many other useful features. For example, they have the ability to slow down or replay something seen through the lenses, although a side effect is that the view in the lenses is not current and can lead to confusion as to the state of the match. They also have a play-by-play feature, where the names of moves performed by Quidditch players is shown in bright purple letters across the Omnioculars' lenses.{{HP4}} Omnioculars also have the ability to list the names and numbers of the players, and can zero in on players rapidly.\n\n===Spellotape===\nSpellotape is magical [[adhesive tape]]. The name is a play on [[Sellotape]], a popular brand which has become a [[genericised trademark|generic name]] for transparent [[adhesive tape]] in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite book |last=Boyle |first=Fiona |title=A Muggle's Guide to the Wizarding World: Exploring The Harry Potter Universe |publisher=[[ECW Press]] |year=2004 |page=[https://archive.org/details/mugglesguidetowi0000boyl/page/363 363] |isbn=1-55022-655-X |url=https://archive.org/details/mugglesguidetowi0000boyl/page/363 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Whited |first=Lana A. |title=The Ivory Tower and Harry Potter: Perspectives on a Literary Phenomenon |publisher=[[University of Missouri Press]] |year=2002 |page=280 |isbn=0-8262-1549-1}}</ref> It is used by Ron in ''Chamber of Secrets'' to repair his wand after he breaks it while trying to halt Mr. Weasley's flying car. It is also used by Hermione in ''Prisoner of Azkaban'' when she binds her ''Care of Magical Creatures'' (the Monster Book of Monsters) textbook to prevent it from biting her, and by Kreacher to mend a photo of Bellatrix Lestrange later in the series. It is used by Ginny in ''Goblet of Fire'', who was mending her copy of the ''One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi'' textbook.\n\n===Wand===\n[[File:The Making of Harry Potter 29-05-2012 (7184365467).jpg|thumb]]\nA [[wand]] is a wooden stick-like object used to channel magical energy and thus increase its power, and without which only limited magic is possible. Wands are used as both tools and weapons in the [[wizarding world]]. They are thus an important aspect of nearly all magic, and great importance is placed on wand mastery. Wands are generally carried inside the wizard's robes or otherwise somewhere on their person; however, they can also be placed into other objects. For instance, Rubeus Hagrid hid the broken halves of his wand inside his umbrella, and in the film adaptations, Lucius Malfoy hides his wand in his cane. In the magical world, when a wizard is expelled from Hogwarts, their wands are snapped in half. This type of damage to a wand is nearly irreparable, though Harry is able to mend his wand, which was accidentally broken by Hermione, with the help of the powerful [[#Elder Wand|Elder Wand]].\n\nA wand is made by a wandmaker who is learned in wandlore, the study of wands. Wands are handcrafted from high-quality woods, or \"wandwoods\", which are capable of sustaining magic (e.g. holly, yew, ebony, vinewood, mahogany, cherry, oak, etc.). A core is then inserted into the middle of the wand from top to bottom, which gives it its power to generate magical effects. Common cores include [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] tail feathers, [[unicorn]] tail hairs, and [[dragon]] heartstrings. Veela hair is also used, but less commonly. In the ''Deathly Hallows'', the Elder Wand is described as the only wand with a core made from the tail hair of a [[Thestral]].<ref name=\"jkextra25\"/> The only wand shop seen in the books is [[Ollivanders]]. Garrick Ollivander is a wandmaker who has an [[eidetic memory]] concerning wands, as well as the ability to identify the distinguishing features of a wand. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', Ollivander is seen to evaluate two foreign wands: Viktor Krum's, whose wand was crafted by Gregorovitch, was unusually thick and had a dragon's heartstring core; Fleur Delacour's, created by an unknown wandmaker, was made of rosewood with a core of Veela hair. Ollivander believes Veela hair produces \"temperamental\" wands and does not use it.\n\nSalazar Slytherin's wand contained a fragment of a basilisk horn, which allowed Slytherin and other Parselmouths who possessed it to cast spells with it at a distance by speaking to it in Parseltongue. In the United States, wand cores are created from the horn of river serpents, [[Wampus cat|Wampus]] hair, Snallygaster heartstring and [[Jackalope]] antlers, a practice originated in the 17th century by the first American wandmaker, Isolt Sayre, an Irish immigrant who founded the Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in [[Massachusetts]], and the Slytherin wand's last owner. She buried it outside the school grounds, and within a year, an unknown species of snakewood tree grew from the burial spot. It resisted all attempts to prune or kill it, but after several years the leaves were found to contain powerful medicinal properties.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/ilvermorny |title=Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry |publisher=Pottermore |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2017-03-01}}</ref>\n\nA wand is generally considered a very personal object. Wands belonging to other [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizards]] can be borrowed, resulting in a comparatively less potent effect. In ''Philosopher's Stone'', Harry had to try out many wands before he found one that \"chose him.\" Wands with cores from the same source give strange effects (''[[Priori Incantatem]]'') when forced to fight each other, as is the case with Harry and Voldemort's wands. In ''Goblet of Fire'', it is revealed each of their wands contains a tail feather from [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Fawkes|Fawkes]], the phoenix belonging to Dumbledore. After ''Priori Incantatem'', the wands get to know the opposites' master, as explained in ''Deathly Hallows''. While, according to Ollivander, any object can channel magic if the wizard is strong enough, wands are the most commonly used because of their efficiency (due to the owner's bond with the wand itself). This can explain how some wizards are able to use spells without wands (for example, retrieving an item with ''Accio'').\n\nFurthermore, wands are able to be won from a witch or wizard and can therefore change their allegiance. This is the case when Harry takes Draco's wand at Malfoy Manor, and consequently the wand's allegiance swaps to Harry, as explained by Ollivander; and, by extension, so does the allegiance of the Elder Wand, which itself has changed hands many times.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n{{Harry Potter}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Magical Objects in Harry Potter}}\n[[Category:Harry Potter objects| ]]\n[[Category:Fictional garments]]\n[[Category:Magical objects|Harry Potter]]\n[[Category:Harry Potter lists]]\n", "name_user": "180.129.56.75", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eBroomsticks)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_objects_in_Harry_Potter"}

During the war years, Webber moved to the office of [[Vincent Harris]], a prolific designer of public buildings, and from whom he drew much inspiration. His work there involved entering his practice into architectural competitions by undertaking urban planning drafts and municipal buildings. \n\nIn 1925, aged 29, Webber won a competition to design a new art gallery and museum in [[Manchester]], to be constructed on the site now occupied by [[Piccadilly Gardens]]. The plans never went ahead, but it brought him much attention from his peers. His first major municipal design was the [[Southampton Civic Centre|Guildhall Civic Centre]] in Southampton, which was built over a ten-year period.  Other civic centres followed, including the Civic Centres at [[Civic Centre, Dagenham|Dagenham]] (1936\u201337), and [[Hammersmith Town Hall|Hammersmith]] (1939\u201340). Together with his municipal structures, his designs total at around 50 buildings, including schools, offices, museums and libraries.\n\nWebber retired to [[Brighton]] in the 1950s where he died in 1963 aged 67.\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:Southampton-CivicCentre-South.jpg|thumb|right|Civic Centre and Guildhall, [[Southampton]] (1929\u201339)]]\nWebber was born at 47 St. Paul's Road, [[Walworth]], [[Surrey]].<ref name=\"FREEDOM\">London Metropolitan Archive; ''Freedom of the City Admission Papers, 1681\u20131930'', Reference Number: COL/CHD/FR/02/2764.</ref> He was the youngest of three children, and the second son to Henry Webber, a shopkeeper,<ref name=\"FREEDOM\"/> and his wife, Clara.<ref>''1901 England Census'', Class; RG13; Piece: 375; Folio: 29; p. 50.</ref>\n\nErnest attended the London School of Building and studied under [[Arthur Beresford Pite]].

During the war years, Webber moved to the office of [[Vincent Harris]], a prolific designer of public buildings, and from whom he drew much inspiration. His work there involved entering his practice into architectural competitions by undertaking urban planning drafts and municipal buildings. \n\nIn 1925, aged 29, Webber won a competition to design a new art gallery and museum in [[Manchester]], to be constructed on the site now occupied by [[Piccadilly Gardens]]. The plans never went ahead, but it brought him much attention from his peers. His first major municipal design was the [[Southampton Civic Centre|Guildhall Civic Centre]] in Southampton, which was built over a ten-year period.  Other civic centres followed, including the Civic Centres at [[Civic Centre, Dagenham|Dagenham]] (1936\u201337), and [[Hammersmith Town Hall|Hammersmith]] (1939\u201340). Together with his municipal structures, his designs total at around 50 buildings, including schools, offices, museums and libraries.\n\nWebber retired to [[Brighton]] in the 1950s where he died in 1963 aged 67.\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:Southampton-CivicCentre-South.jpg|thumb|right|Civic Centre and Guildhall, [[Southampton]] (1929\u201339)]]\nWebber was born at 47 St. Paul's Road, [[Walworth]], [[Surrey]].<ref name=\"FREEDOM\">London Metropolitan Archive; ''Freedom of the City Admission Papers, 1681\u20131930'', Reference Number: COL/CHD/FR/02/2764.</ref> He was the youngest of three children, and the second son to Henry Webber, a shopkeeper,<ref name=\"FREEDOM\"/> and his wife, Clara.<ref>''1901 England Census'', Class; RG13; Piece: 375; Folio: 29; p. 50.</ref>\n\nErnest attended the London School of Building and studied under [[Arthur Beresford Pite]].

The album is a [[concept album]] about the death of Elverum's wife, the Canadian cartoonist and musician [[Genevi\u00e8ve Castr\u00e9e]]. The album was written and produced entirely by Elverum, who recorded the album using mostly Castr\u00e9e's instruments in the room in which she died and features minimal production and sparse instrumentation which was a departure from Elverum's previous work. ''A Crow Looked at Me'' was released on March 24, 2017 on Elverum's own label, P.W. Elverum & Sun.\n\nPrior to the release of the album, Elverum released two singles, \"Real Death\" and \"Ravens\", released on January 18, 2017, and February 15, 2017, respectively. Both songs deal with Castr\u00e9e's death and Elverum dealing with the aftermath. Both songs received critical acclaim each earning best new track by [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] with \"Real Death\" being number three on the \"100 Best Songs of 2017\" list. ''A Crow Looked at Me'' was an immediate and widespread critical success, appearing on numerous best of year lists. In the years following its release, the album has appeared in multiple best of decade lists. Some critics found that due to the nature of the album, reviewing it was difficult and disrespectful.\n\n==Background and composition==\n[[File:Gary Snyder, Mark Kozelek, Julie Doiron, Karl Ove Knausg\u00e5rd.jpg|thumb|250x250px|left|From left to right: Poet Gary Snyder, American musician Mark Kozelek, Norwegian writter Karl Ove Knausg\u00e5rd and Canadian singer-songwriter Julie Doiron all of which Phil Elverum took inspiration from]]\n\nIn 2015, [[Phil Elverum]]'s wife, Canadian cartoonist and musician [[Genevi\u00e8ve Castr\u00e9e]], was diagnosed with [[pancreatic cancer]] four months after the birth of their first child.

The album is a [[concept album]] about the death of Elverum's wife, the Canadian cartoonist and musician [[Genevi\u00e8ve Castr\u00e9e]]. The album was written and produced entirely by Elverum, who recorded the album using mostly Castr\u00e9e's instruments in the room in which she died and features minimal production and sparse instrumentation which was a departure from Elverum's previous work. ''A Crow Looked at Me'' was released on March 24, 2017 on Elverum's own label, P.W. Elverum & Sun.\n\nPrior to the release of the album, Elverum released two singles, \"Real Death\" and \"Ravens\", released on January 18, 2017, and February 15, 2017, respectively. Both songs deal with Castr\u00e9e's death and Elverum dealing with the aftermath. Both songs received critical acclaim each earning best new track by [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] with \"Real Death\" being number three on the \"100 Best Songs of 2017\" list. ''A Crow Looked at Me'' was an immediate and widespread critical success, appearing on numerous best of year lists. In the years following its release, the album has appeared in multiple best of decade lists. Some critics found that due to the nature of the album, reviewing it was difficult and disrespectful.\n\n==Background and composition==\n[[File:Gary Snyder, Mark Kozelek, Julie Doiron, Karl Ove Knausg\u00e5rd.jpg|thumb|250x250px|left|From left to right: Poet Gary Snyder, American musician Mark Kozelek, Norwegian writter Karl Ove Knausg\u00e5rd and Canadian singer-songwriter Julie Doiron all of which Phil Elverum took inspiration from]]\n\nIn 2015, [[Phil Elverum]]'s wife, Canadian cartoonist and musician [[Genevi\u00e8ve Castr\u00e9e]], was diagnosed with [[pancreatic cancer]] four months after the birth of their first child.

While originally planned for syndication, the format became the original lineup of [[MyNetworkTV]] in 2006.  Six limited-run serials were produced, each running about 65 episodes, and at least three others were halted in development.\n\nNew episodes aired from Monday to Friday \u2013 and weekend clip shows recapped the shows' storylines.   Producers planned continuous cycles of thirteen-week serials with no repeats.  Once one series ended, another unrelated melodrama would begin the following week.  In total, MyNetworkTV planned to air 600 hours of original dramatic programming in HDTV every year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.convergenceculture.org/weblog/2006/08/mynetworktv_first_broadcast_ne.php|title=Futures of Entertainment: Archives|publisher=|accessdate=27 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastdialogue.com/pdfs/newsletters/2006/nl20060817_14_11.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927063853/http://www.broadcastdialogue.com/pdfs/newsletters/2006/nl20060817_14_11.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-27 }}</ref>\n\nThe telenovela format was unsuccessful and ratings were unexpectedly low.

It argued that teenagers are out of school and planted in front of their TV sets, while reruns dominate network schedules. The telenovelas were also briefly considered for placement on [[The CW Television Network|The CW]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\n====MyNetworkTV====\nFox Television Stations chairman [[Roger Ailes]] greenlit the format as a contingency plan for Fox-owned [[UPN]] stations.  Then MyNetworkTV was introduced to advertisers on February 22, 2006, as a reaction to the demise of UPN and The WB. The telenovelas became the new network's weeknight lineup, along with clip shows on Saturdays.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvweek.com/news/2006/05/upfront_navigator_mynetworktv.php|title=Upfront Navigator: MYNETWORKTV: Breaking New Programming Ground with Telenovelas  -  TVWeek|publisher=|accessdate=27 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nMyNetworkTV targeted the telenovelas at the \"Adults 18-49\" demographic, which is a general audience. While the novelas had a few takers for a planned summer syndication run, Twentieth made those stations surrender the shows, thanks to a contract clause that let Fox take away the show if it is carried by a network.\n\nAs MyNetworkTV's debut grew closer, Fox dropped the idea of using two umbrella titles for its telenovelas. ''Desire'' became the title of the first series aired. The two umbrella titles reappeared in 2007, showing up during opening credits and on the network's Web site.\n\n===Budgets===\nJack Abernethy, chief executive of Fox Television Stations, said before launch that MyNetworkTV's six-day-per-week format was the wave of the future because a traditional schedule costs too much.<ref name=\"wsj0185\">{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115698811194650185| title=With sexy story lines, low budgets, News Corp. will launch MyNetworkTV| author=Brooke Barnes| accessdate=2006-12-13| work=The Wall Street Journal Online| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314093050/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115698811194650185| archivedate=2016-03-14}} </ref>  Each episode was said to cost about one-tenth the budget of traditional prime-time shows,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.philly.com/mld/philly/entertainment/columnists/jonathan_storm/15121967.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311001822/http://www.philly.com/mld/philly/entertainment/columnists/jonathan_storm/15121967.htm |archivedate=2007-03-11 }}</ref> and even less than the typical daytime soap.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117934563.html?categoryid=1952&cs=1 | work=Variety | title=20Th Gets Soaped Up | first=Elizabeth | last=Guider | date=December 13, 2005}}</ref> Another estimate said the serials cost $200,000 to $500,000, compared to the $2 million to $3 million cost of a mainstream primetime drama.<ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3i841febf193b813600009c75ffb60970a|title=Entertainment/Hollywood News|publisher=|accessdate=27 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nUnfortunately, ad revenue was not sufficient for the format to succeed.

Each show was scripted, filmed and completed as a whole. The network could not shorten or lengthen shows.\n\nIn familiar [[telenovela]] form, shows often began with the tag \u201cMyNetworkTV Presents.\u201d Yet the beginnings of shows featured long flashbacks intended to refresh viewers. The first two rotations also added titles to each episode.\n\nThe daily format also featured the \u201cStory\u201d episode. These were clip shows that outlined the development of a major character.  They were used in lieu of reruns. In addition, MyNetworkTV's shows featured white, black and Hispanic actors in prominent roles and often showed interracial couples, along with gay subplots. These English novelas also toned down the high pitched emotionalism of conventional telenovelas.\n\nThe producers said they needed to account for the cultural differences with Latin countries.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/25/arts/television/25nove.html?pagewanted=2&ei=5090&en=1b28c85d194b6ce4&ex=1303617600&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss | work=The New York Times | title=Telenovelas to Deliver La Pasi\u00f3n in English | first=Mireya | last=Navarro | date=April 25, 2006 | accessdate=May 19, 2010}}</ref> So while these serials were said to add campiness, cat-fights and gay sensibility,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.advocate.com/print_article_ektid40796.asp |title=Print this Article: Love, Latin American style |work= Advocate.com |access-date= 2007-07-22 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070930154737/http://www.advocate.com/print_article_ektid40796.asp |archive-date=2007-09-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref> they were also seen to lack the \"cultural depth\" and \"raw passion\" of the Spanish originals.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.today.com/popculture/telenovelas-make-leap-english-wbna14586450 |title= \u2018Telenovelas\u2019 make the leap into English |date= 30 August 2006 |publisher= |accessdate= 27 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nCamilo Cano, the VP of [[Caracol TV|Caracol Television International]], which sold two telenovela formats to MyNetworkTV, said he was satisfied with the English versions. \u201cThe basic elements of the novela were respected,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich is what concerns us the most.\u201d He said Caracol worked to ensure the adaptations were faithful to the original serials.<ref>[http://www.worldscreen.com/featurescurrent.php?filename=novelas0407.htm World Screen - Home<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===Broadcast rotations===\nAll times are [[North American Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] and [[Pacific Time zone|Pacific]] (subtract one hour for [[Central Time zone|Central]] and [[Mountain Time Zone|Mountain]] time)\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n!\n!  style=\"width:15%; background:silver;\"|Telenovela\n!  style=\"width:7%; background:silver;\"|Time\n!  style=\"width:15%; background:silver;\"|Premiere Date\n!  style=\"width:15%; background:silver;\"|Finale Date\n|-\n!  style=\"width:10%; background:silver;\"|Fall 2006\n|  style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"|''[[Desire (TV series)|Desire]]''\n|  style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"|8:00 P.M.\n|  style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"|September 5, 2006\n|  style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"|December 5, 2006\n|-\n!  style=\"width:10%; background:silver;\"|Fall 2006\n|  style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"|''[[Fashion House]]''\n|  style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"|9:00 P.M.\n|  style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"|September 5, 2006\n|  style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"|December 5, 2006\n|-\n!  style=\"width:10%; background:silver;\"|Winter 2006\n|  style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"|''[[Wicked Wicked Games]]'' \n|  style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"|8:00 P.M.\n|  style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"|December 6, 2006\n|  style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"|March 6, 2007\n|-\n!  style=\"width:10%; background:silver;\"|Winter 2006\n|  style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"|''[[Watch Over Me]]''\n|  style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"|9:00 P.M.\n|  style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"|December 6, 2006\n|  style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"|March 6, 2007\n|-\n!  style=\"width:10%; background:silver;\"|Spring 2007\n|  style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"|''[[American Heiress]]''\n|  style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"|Weekly\n|  style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"|March 13, 2007\n|  style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"|July 18, 2007\n|-\n!  style=\"width:10%; background:silver;\"|Spring 2007\n|  style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"|''[[Saints & Sinners (2007 TV series)|Saints & Sinners]]''\n|  style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"|Weekly\n|  style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"|March 14, 2007\n|  style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"|July 18, 2007\n|}\n\nHad the daily format continued, ''[[Friends with Benefits (telenovela)|Friends with Benefits]]'' and ''Rules of Deception'' would have debuted on June 5, 2007.

Paul Buccieri called them \"guilty pleasures\" and compared them to beach novels.<ref name=autogenerated4 /> While these shows attempted to adhere to the [[telenovela]] format and tone, the network's executives and producers developed their own campy interpretation of the genre. They added characters and situations that differed from the Latin American originals.

Each show was scripted, filmed and completed as a whole. The network could not shorten or lengthen shows.\n\nIn familiar [[telenovela]] form, shows often began with the tag \u201cMyNetworkTV Presents.\u201d Yet the beginnings of shows featured long flashbacks intended to refresh viewers. The first two rotations also added titles to each episode.\n\nThe daily format also featured the \u201cStory\u201d episode. These were clip shows that outlined the development of a major character.  They were used in lieu of reruns. In addition, MyNetworkTV's shows featured white, black and Hispanic actors in prominent roles and often showed interracial couples, along with gay subplots.

Paul Buccieri called them \"guilty pleasures\" and compared them to beach novels.<ref name=autogenerated4 /> While these shows attempted to adhere to the [[telenovela]] format and tone, the network's executives and producers developed their own campy interpretation of the genre. They added characters and situations that differed from the Latin American originals. As telenovelas are inherently implausible and cartoonish, both Hispanic and non-Hispanic audiences scorned the new adaptations.<ref>Plot Twists for Genre By Luis Clemens -- Multichannel News, 10/16/2006</ref>\n\nReviewers were resoundingly negative.

Each class gives the player various different attacks, spells, and passive effects. The game has other character choices beyond those of race and class, such as the player character also being able to become either a vampire or a werewolf, each of which grants its own skill tree. There are seven different crafting skill lines: Alchemy, Blacksmithing, Clothier, Enchanting, Woodworking, Provisioning, and Jewelry Crafting.\n\n==Setting==\nThe game is set on the continent of [[Tamriel]] during the Second Era, but not all places in Tamriel are playable. The events of the game occur a millennium before those of ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]'' and around 800 years before ''[[The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind]]'' and ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]''. Its structure is broadly similar to ''Skyrim'', with two separate conflicts progressing at the same time, one with the fate of the world in the balance, and one where the prize is supreme power on Tamriel. In ''The Elder Scrolls Online'', the first struggle is against the [[Races of The Elder Scrolls#Daedra|Daedric]] Prince Molag Bal, who is attempting to meld the plane of Mundus with his realm of Coldharbour, and the second is to capture the vacant imperial throne, contested by three alliances of the mortal races. The player character has been sacrificed to Molag Bal, and Molag Bal has stolen their soul, the recovery of which is the primary game objective.<ref name=\"GIReveal\" />\n\nMany parts of the continent of Tamriel are available in the game, with most zones accessible regardless of faction or player level. Some zones are accessible with DLC-only from the Crown Store or by subscribing to ESO. Players have the opportunity to join any of the three factions warring over the Ruby Throne of the Emperor of Tamriel:<ref name=\"GIReveal\" /> the First Aldmeri Dominion (represented by an eagle) led by Queen Ayrenn, composed of the Altmer (High Elf), Bosmer (Wood Elf), and Khajiit races; the Daggerfall Covenant (represented by a lion) led by High King Emeric, composed of the Bretons, Redguard, and Orsimer (Orcs); and the Ebonheart Pact (represented by a dragon) led by Jorunn Skald-King, composed of the Nord, Dunmer (Dark Elf), and Argonian races. Players may also unlock the Imperial race by purchasing the Digital Imperial Edition Upgrade in the Crown Store, which may be a part of any of the three factions. The other major ruling faction of Tamriel is the Empire, led by Empress Regent Clivia Tharn, which has fallen into instability and disrepair and serves as a non-joinable faction. Pre-ordered copies of the game included the \"Explorers' Pack\" which allowed all races to be played in each of the factions, and this feature is also available in the Crown Store.<ref name=\"CrownStoreUpgrades\">{{cite web|url=http://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/crownstore/category/upgrades|title=Crown Store - Upgrades|publisher=Zenimax|date=June 13, 2015|accessdate=January 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe game begins in the Wailing Prison in Coldharbour, where the player character's soulless husk (known as a soul shriven) has been enslaved.

Each class gives the player various different attacks, spells, and passive effects. The game has other character choices beyond those of race and class, such as the player character also being able to become either a vampire or a werewolf, each of which grants its own skill tree. There are seven different crafting skill lines: Alchemy, Blacksmithing, Clothier, Enchanting, Woodworking, Provisioning, and Jewelry Crafting.\n\n==Setting==\nThe game is set on the continent of [[Tamriel]] during the Second Era, but not all places in Tamriel are playable. The events of the game occur a millennium before those of ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]'' and around 800 years before ''[[The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind]]'' and ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]''. Its structure is broadly similar to ''Skyrim'', with two separate conflicts progressing at the same time, one with the fate of the world in the balance, and one where the prize is supreme power on Tamriel. In ''The Elder Scrolls Online'', the first struggle is against the [[Races of The Elder Scrolls#Daedra|Daedric]] Prince Molag Bal, who is attempting to meld the plane of Mundus with his realm of Coldharbour, and the second is to capture the vacant imperial throne, contested by three alliances of the mortal races. The player character has been sacrificed to Molag Bal, and Molag Bal has stolen their soul, the recovery of which is the primary game objective.<ref name=\"GIReveal\" />\n\nMany parts of the continent of Tamriel are available in the game, with most zones accessible regardless of faction or player level. Some zones are accessible with DLC-only from the Crown Store or by subscribing to ESO. Players have the opportunity to join any of the three factions warring over the Ruby Throne of the Emperor of Tamriel:<ref name=\"GIReveal\" /> the First Aldmeri Dominion (represented by an eagle) led by Queen Ayrenn, composed of the Altmer (High Elf), Bosmer (Wood Elf), and Khajiit races; the Daggerfall Covenant (represented by a lion) led by High King Emeric, composed of the Bretons, Redguard, and Orsimer (Orcs); and the Ebonheart Pact (represented by a dragon) led by Jorunn Skald-King, composed of the Nord, Dunmer (Dark Elf), and Argonian races. Players may also unlock the Imperial race by purchasing the Digital Imperial Edition Upgrade in the Crown Store, which may be a part of any of the three factions. The other major ruling faction of Tamriel is the Empire, led by Empress Regent Clivia Tharn, which has fallen into instability and disrepair and serves as a non-joinable faction. Pre-ordered copies of the game included the \"Explorers' Pack\" which allowed all races to be played in each of the factions, and this feature is also available in the Crown Store.<ref name=\"CrownStoreUpgrades\">{{cite web|url=http://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/crownstore/category/upgrades|title=Crown Store - Upgrades|publisher=Zenimax|date=June 13, 2015|accessdate=January 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe game begins in the Wailing Prison in Coldharbour, where the player character's soulless husk (known as a soul shriven) has been enslaved. This opening continues another ''Elder Scrolls'' tradition of beginning the game with the player as a prisoner.<ref name=\"GIReveal\" /> After escaping, the base of operations becomes the Harborage, a cave found at each of the starting cities where the Prophet opens portals to the locations of the main questline. Once the Amulet of Kings is retrieved, the headquarters shift to the Hollow City, a location in central Coldharbour blessed by Meridia. Civilians saved from Coldharbour's prisons arrive in the Hollow City, and it is from there that attacks are orchestrated on Molag Bal's controlled areas.<ref name=\"IGNMainQuest\">{{cite web|url=http://ign.com/wikis/elder-scrolls-online/Walkthrough|title=Elder Scrolls Online Main Quest Walkthrough|publisher=IGN|date=July 24, 2014|accessdate=June 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\n''The Elder Scrolls Online'' had been in development for seven years before its release in 2014.<ref name=\"GIReveal\" /> It is the first project for [[ZeniMax Online Studios]], which was formed in 2007.

With rare exceptions, the convention is traditionally held on the first weekend in July, which typically coincides with the [[4th of July]], and lasts for four days. While currently hosted at the [[Los Angeles Convention Center]], in the past Anime Expo has been held in other locations such as Anaheim, San Jose, New York, and Tokyo. Anime Expo is the largest North American anime convention as of 2017.<ref name=aclargest2017>{{cite web|last1=Delahanty|first1=Patrick|title=Largest North American Anime Conventions of 2017|url=https://animecons.com/news/post/1516/largest-north-american-anime-conventions-of-2017|publisher=AnimeCons.com|accessdate=6 June 2018|date=January 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Events and programming==\nAnime Expo features many events and activities during the convention for attendees to take part in such as guest panels, table top gaming, competitions, an arcade, and concerts.\n\nTop attractions include events such as the Masquerade [[cosplay]] contest, the [[Anime Music Video]] (AMV) competition, Battle of the Bands, and SPJA's Charity Auction. In addition, Anime Expo hosts a multitude of industry Guests of Honor (GoH), including notable music artists who often hold large concerts at AX. Anime Expo also has a large variety of focus panels, workshops, and events, some of which are fan or industry sponsored. Finally, there are also a number of film and video rooms presenting anime screenings that run all day and night.\n\nMuch like other conventions, Anime Expo also features a large scale exhibit hall where attendees can purchase a variety of products from a wide range of exhibitors. This exhibit hall also features an artist alley where attendees can purchase fan-created art work, as well as other varieties of crafts such as wigs, pins, and [[cosplay]] material.\n\n==Convention history==\n\n===History===\n[[File:Cosplayers of Naruto at Anime Expo 2006-07-02.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Naruto]] cosplayers at Anime Expo 2006]]\nAnime Expo began as an anime and manga convention in Northern California. Many of its original staff came from [[Anime Con]], an anime convention held in [[San Jose, California]] in 1991, and later absorbed by the SPJA in 1992. In 1994, Anime Expo made a strategic relocation to Southern California and has resided there since.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yYInVE6OLiQC&pg=PA153&lpg=PA153&dq=anime+expo+moved+to+southern+california#v=onepage&q=anime%20expo%20moved%20to%20southern%20california&f=false|title=Demanding Respect: The Evolution of the American Comic Book|last=Lopes|first=Paul|date=2009-04-07|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=9781592134441|location=|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe convention continues to thrive due to the growing popularity of anime and Japanese popular culture and maintains a strong draw due to the many notable Japanese guests it has been known for.

Due to differences, the event ran as separate entities within the same time frame and venues, with BAAF hosting the theatrical film screenings, and Anime Expo New York hosting the convention. The events shared some resources, with notable guests listed in the program guides of both events.\nThe SPJA ran the event in order to demonstrate that it could run events outside its home state of California. The event was a precursor to Anime Expo Tokyo which ran in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]] in 2004.<ref name=\"AC-2004T\" />\nThe SPJA has not run any events outside California since 2004.\n\n=====Convention locations=====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n!

JASFIC had two goals for Anime Expo Tokyo. The first goal was to establish in Japan a non-corporate sponsored convention dedicated to anime. The second goal was to demonstrate to the organizers of the World Science Fiction Convention ([[WorldCon]]) that Japan could serve as a suitable venue for conventions that attract foreigners. Although Anime Expo Tokyo did not go on to a second year, JASFIC was ultimately successful in attracting the [[65th World Science Fiction Convention]] to Japan in 2007.\n\nAnime Expo Tokyo had a staggering list of over 40 guests such as manga artist [[Ken Akamatsu]], MiQ, [[Under17]], [[Hiroshi Aro]], and many others, although a small handful had to make last minute cancellations. Anime Expo Tokyo was also the very first Anime Expo that officially hosted guests from the U.S. anime industry such as webcomic artist [[Fred Gallagher (cartoonist)|Fred Gallagher]] and voice actor [[Crispin Freeman]].<ref name=\"AC-2004T\" />\n\nOf Anime Expo Tokyo's 4,249 attendees, approximately 300 of that number were estimated to have traveled from abroad. In addition to the attendance numbers were 240 members of the press, 40 of which were from overseas.

With rare exceptions, the convention is traditionally held on the first weekend in July, which typically coincides with the [[4th of July]], and lasts for four days. While currently hosted at the [[Los Angeles Convention Center]], in the past Anime Expo has been held in other locations such as Anaheim, San Jose, New York, and Tokyo. Anime Expo is the largest North American anime convention as of 2017.<ref name=aclargest2017>{{cite web|last1=Delahanty|first1=Patrick|title=Largest North American Anime Conventions of 2017|url=https://animecons.com/news/post/1516/largest-north-american-anime-conventions-of-2017|publisher=AnimeCons.com|accessdate=6 June 2018|date=January 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Events and programming==\nAnime Expo features many events and activities during the convention for attendees to take part in such as guest panels, table top gaming, competitions, an arcade, and concerts.\n\nTop attractions include events such as the Masquerade [[cosplay]] contest, the [[Anime Music Video]] (AMV) competition, Battle of the Bands, and SPJA's Charity Auction. In addition, Anime Expo hosts a multitude of industry Guests of Honor (GoH), including notable music artists who often hold large concerts at AX. Anime Expo also has a large variety of focus panels, workshops, and events, some of which are fan or industry sponsored. Finally, there are also a number of film and video rooms presenting anime screenings that run all day and night.\n\nMuch like other conventions, Anime Expo also features a large scale exhibit hall where attendees can purchase a variety of products from a wide range of exhibitors. This exhibit hall also features an artist alley where attendees can purchase fan-created art work, as well as other varieties of crafts such as wigs, pins, and [[cosplay]] material.\n\n==Convention history==\n\n===History===\n[[File:Cosplayers of Naruto at Anime Expo 2006-07-02.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Naruto]] cosplayers at Anime Expo 2006]]\nAnime Expo began as an anime and manga convention in Northern California. Many of its original staff came from [[Anime Con]], an anime convention held in [[San Jose, California]] in 1991, and later absorbed by the SPJA in 1992. In 1994, Anime Expo made a strategic relocation to Southern California and has resided there since.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yYInVE6OLiQC&pg=PA153&lpg=PA153&dq=anime+expo+moved+to+southern+california#v=onepage&q=anime%20expo%20moved%20to%20southern%20california&f=false|title=Demanding Respect: The Evolution of the American Comic Book|last=Lopes|first=Paul|date=2009-04-07|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=9781592134441|location=|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe convention continues to thrive due to the growing popularity of anime and Japanese popular culture and maintains a strong draw due to the many notable Japanese guests it has been known for. It currently holds the title of North America's largest anime convention, a title which it has consistently held every year except 2003 in which its attendance was slightly edged out by east coast convention [[Otakon]].<ref name=\"AC2003\">{{cite web| last=Delahanty|first=Patrick| url = https://animecons.com/news/post/410/ten-largest-north-american-anime-conventions-of-2003 | title = Ten largest North American anime conventions of 2003 | work = AnimeCons.com | date = 2007-01-09 | accessdate = 2018-06-06}}</ref> From 1,750 attendees in 1992, Anime Expo's size has increased to over 107,658 in 2017, which makes Anime Expo the largest anime and manga convention in [[North America]].<ref name=aclargest2017/>\n\nAs of March 2009, Chief Executive Officer Trulee Karahashi, who had been a part of Anime Expo and the SPJA in various capacities for 11 years, left the organization.<ref>[http://www.spja.org/ To: SPJA Executive Members, Convention Committee, Anime Expo Managers, Staff and Volunteers], March 28, 2009</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spja.org/career/chief-executive-officer-ceo-for-the-society-for-the-promotion-of-japanese-animation-spja/|title=Chief Executive Officer (CEO) for The Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation \"(SPJA)\"}}</ref> Former Universal Studios executive Michael Lattanzio was hired as the SPJA's new CEO in September.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://spja.org/news/?p=29|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728045413/http://spja.org/news/?p=29|url-status=dead|title=The Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation Announces New President and Chief Executive Officer|archivedate=July 28, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.japanator.com/spja-announces-new-ceo-michael-lattanzio-11293.phtml|title=SPJA announces new CEO, Michael Lattanzio|website=Japanator}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2010, eight members of Anime Expo's upper management team (ConCom) publicly resigned over irreconcilable disagreements over the direction of the organization set forth by the SPJA's new CEO. One significant point of contention was the new CEO's decision to refocus and restructure the SPJA's marketing efforts starting with the dismissal of a PR and marketing contractor that the organization had a close working relationship with since 2004. Additionally, two other personnel had already left for other reasons, leaving only the vice chair and two others as returning members of the previous year's team.<ref>[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-01-11/multiple-anime-expo-staffers-resign-in-board-dispute Multiple Anime Expo Staffers Resign in Board Dispute] January 11, 2010</ref>\n\nAs of September 2010, Michael Lattanzio was released from his CEO position.<ref>[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-09-25/anime-expo-parent-ceo-michael-lattanzio-steps-down] September 25, 2010</ref> Then SPJA Chairman of the Board Marc Perez, became acting-CEO; In August 2011 he stepped down from the Board of Directors to take over as a full-time CEO (as required by the SPJA bylaws).\n\nIn early 2012, [[Anime News Network]] reported that Anime Expo suffered a $1.2 million loss in 2010.<ref>[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-02-03/exclusive/anime-expo-2010-lost-us$1.2-million-idg-to-boost-involvement-in-2012 Exclusive: AX 2010 Lost $1.2 Million; IDG to Boost Involvement], Animenewsnetwork, February 3, 2012</ref> The 2011 convention saw a $100,000 profit and reduced the outstanding debt to $700,000.

Due to differences, the event ran as separate entities within the same time frame and venues, with BAAF hosting the theatrical film screenings, and Anime Expo New York hosting the convention. The events shared some resources, with notable guests listed in the program guides of both events.\nThe SPJA ran the event in order to demonstrate that it could run events outside its home state of California. The event was a precursor to Anime Expo Tokyo which ran in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]] in 2004.<ref name=\"AC-2004T\" />\nThe SPJA has not run any events outside California since 2004.\n\n=====Convention locations=====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n!

JASFIC had two goals for Anime Expo Tokyo. The first goal was to establish in Japan a non-corporate sponsored convention dedicated to anime. The second goal was to demonstrate to the organizers of the World Science Fiction Convention ([[WorldCon]]) that Japan could serve as a suitable venue for conventions that attract foreigners. Although Anime Expo Tokyo did not go on to a second year, JASFIC was ultimately successful in attracting the [[65th World Science Fiction Convention]] to Japan in 2007.\n\nAnime Expo Tokyo had a staggering list of over 40 guests such as manga artist [[Ken Akamatsu]], MiQ, [[Under17]], [[Hiroshi Aro]], and many others, although a small handful had to make last minute cancellations. Anime Expo Tokyo was also the very first Anime Expo that officially hosted guests from the U.S. anime industry such as webcomic artist [[Fred Gallagher (cartoonist)|Fred Gallagher]] and voice actor [[Crispin Freeman]].<ref name=\"AC-2004T\" />\n\nOf Anime Expo Tokyo's 4,249 attendees, approximately 300 of that number were estimated to have traveled from abroad. In addition to the attendance numbers were 240 members of the press, 40 of which were from overseas. An additional 430 people were composed of dealers, guests, or staff.\n\nNo plans to host another official Anime Expo outside California have been announced.\n\n=====Convention locations=====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n!

This romantic melodrama tells the story of a roughneck pilot and a pampered heiress who survive a plane crash.  The show was produced by [[Fox Television Studios|Twentieth Television]], based on the 2004 [[TV Azteca]] series ''[[La Heredera]]'' (\"''The Heiress''\").\n\n''Heiress'' was the last series produced for [[MyNetworkTV telenovelas|MyNetworkTV]]'s original all-telenovela format.  When the network dropped the serial after the July 18, 2007 broadcast, most episodes were left unaired. [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]] has not announced plans to release this series on [[DVD]] and/or [[Blu-ray]]. All 65 episodes aired overseas.\n\n==Story==\n{{main|List of American Heiress episodes}}\nThis limited-run serial follows the title character, Elizabeth Wakefield, played by [[Alicia Leigh Willis]], from steamy rain forests to the high-stakes business world.  After a terrifying crash in the family jet, the heiress falls in love with a fellow survivor, a hard-edged former [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] pilot named JD Bruce ([[Carter MacIntyre]]).\n\nThe new couple then must struggle to survive in the lost jungles of [[Guatemala]]. Once back in civilization, the heiress soon finds herself in another tough situation. Against her family's wishes, she fights to keep the flames of passion burning.  Meanwhile, her brother Damian makes deals with an arms dealer; he will do anything to protect his secret.\n\n==Production ==\nHead writer Colet Abedi said she added \"bitchy dialogue and fight scenes\" to the original Mexican story.<ref>[http://www.out.com/detail.asp?id=22384 A Summer of Camp], ''Out.com'', April 1, 2007</ref>  Late in production, about six episodes\u2019 worth of scenes were never shot due to budget concerns. In addition, about 75 minutes of program were stretched to fill the two-hour weekly timeslot.<ref>[http://www.southflorida.com/movies/sfl-tvtjmynetmar12,0,469232.column?coll=sfe-tv-headlines]</ref> Fox also received promotional consideration for this series from several automakers, including Cadillac, Jaguar and Lexus.\n\n[[MyNetworkTV]] prepared to air this serial as 65 one-hour episodes on weekdays with a Saturday night recap.

This romantic melodrama tells the story of a roughneck pilot and a pampered heiress who survive a plane crash.  The show was produced by [[Fox Television Studios|Twentieth Television]], based on the 2004 [[TV Azteca]] series ''[[La Heredera]]'' (\"''The Heiress''\").\n\n''Heiress'' was the last series produced for [[MyNetworkTV telenovelas|MyNetworkTV]]'s original all-telenovela format.  When the network dropped the serial after the July 18, 2007 broadcast, most episodes were left unaired. [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]] has not announced plans to release this series on [[DVD]] and/or [[Blu-ray]]. All 65 episodes aired overseas.\n\n==Story==\n{{main|List of American Heiress episodes}}\nThis limited-run serial follows the title character, Elizabeth Wakefield, played by [[Alicia Leigh Willis]], from steamy rain forests to the high-stakes business world.  After a terrifying crash in the family jet, the heiress falls in love with a fellow survivor, a hard-edged former [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] pilot named JD Bruce ([[Carter MacIntyre]]).\n\nThe new couple then must struggle to survive in the lost jungles of [[Guatemala]]. Once back in civilization, the heiress soon finds herself in another tough situation. Against her family's wishes, she fights to keep the flames of passion burning.  Meanwhile, her brother Damian makes deals with an arms dealer; he will do anything to protect his secret.\n\n==Production ==\nHead writer Colet Abedi said she added \"bitchy dialogue and fight scenes\" to the original Mexican story.<ref>[http://www.out.com/detail.asp?id=22384 A Summer of Camp], ''Out.com'', April 1, 2007</ref>  Late in production, about six episodes\u2019 worth of scenes were never shot due to budget concerns. In addition, about 75 minutes of program were stretched to fill the two-hour weekly timeslot.<ref>[http://www.southflorida.com/movies/sfl-tvtjmynetmar12,0,469232.column?coll=sfe-tv-headlines]</ref> Fox also received promotional consideration for this series from several automakers, including Cadillac, Jaguar and Lexus.\n\n[[MyNetworkTV]] prepared to air this serial as 65 one-hour episodes on weekdays with a Saturday night recap.
