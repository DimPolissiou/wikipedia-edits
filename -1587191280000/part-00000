The episode was directed by [[Keith Boak]] and written by [[Russell T Davies]] who was also one of the three executive producers. It was first broadcast in the UK on [[BBC One]] on 26 March 2005. \"Rose\" was the first ''Doctor Who'' episode to air since the [[Doctor Who (film)|''Doctor Who'' television film]] in 1996.\n\nIn the episode, the London department store worker [[Rose Tyler]] ([[Billie Piper]]) gets caught in the middle of the alien [[Time travel in fiction|time traveller]] [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]]'s ([[Christopher Eccleston]]) plot to prevent an invasion of the [[Earth]] by the [[Nestene Consciousness]] (voiced by [[Nicholas Briggs]]) and the [[Auton]]s after the Doctor destroys Rose's workplace.\n\nThe episode marked Eccleston's first appearance as the Doctor, succeeding several other actors who played the role, and Piper's debut as the Doctor's travelling [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] Rose. Being the first episode of the revived series, several recurring characters were introduced: [[Camille Coduri]] as [[Jackie Tyler]], and [[Noel Clarke]] as [[Mickey Smith]]. Viewers did not see the Doctor character regenerate from a previous incarnation, [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regeneration]] being a plot device in which the character of the Doctor changes appearance. Russell T Davies felt it would be clearer for the viewer to begin the series with the new actor in place rather than show the previous actor regenerating.\n\nLocation filming principally took place in Cardiff, the headquarters of [[BBC Wales]], in July and August 2004, with some location scenes shot in London in July. Studio work principally took place at the Unit Q2 warehouse in [[Newport, Wales|Newport]] in August and September. Model work was recorded at the [[BBC]]'s Model Unit in London in September, and some additional filming was recorded in Cardiff in October and November. \"Rose\" was viewed by 10.81 million viewers in the UK, the most viewed ''Doctor Who'' episode since ''[[The Creature from the Pit]]'' in 1979,<ref name=\"cultbox\">{{cite web|url=https://cultbox.co.uk/features/trivia/top-10-most-watched-doctor-who-episodes-since-2005|title=Top 10 most-watched 'Doctor Who' episodes since 2005|website=Cultbox|last=Martin|first=William|date=March 24, 2016|accessdate=February 16, 2020}}</ref> and received positive reviews from critics, though there were some criticisms of its use of humour.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Rose Tyler]], a teenage shop assistant, is chased by mannequins in the basement of Henrik's, the department store where she works. She is rescued by the [[Ninth Doctor]], who destroys the building with an explosion. The next day, the Doctor visits Rose at her home, where he is attacked by a plastic mannequin arm which he and Rose subdue. Rose investigates the Doctor and meets Clive, who has been tracking the Doctor's appearances throughout history. Clive tells Rose that the Doctor is dangerous and that if he's there, something bad is about to happen. While Rose is talking to Clive, her boyfriend [[Mickey Smith]] is kidnapped by a wheelie bin and replaced with a plastic [[doppelg\u00e4nger]].\n\nThe fake Mickey takes Rose to lunch and attempts to question her about the Doctor, but the Doctor shows up and beheads the doppelg\u00e4nger. The Doctor takes Rose and the plastic head to the [[TARDIS]] and attempts to use the head to locate the controlling signal. With the head connected, the TARDIS takes them to the [[London Eye]]. The Doctor explains to Rose that the fake Mickey was an [[Auton]], controlled by a signal from the Nestene Consciousness. He has a vial of anti-plastic that can be used to destroy the Nestene Consciousness if necessary. Realising that the transmitter is the London Eye itself, Rose and the Doctor descend underneath it to stop the Nestene Consciousness. They find Mickey, tied up but alive, and the Doctor speaks to the Nestene Consciousness. He tries to negotiate with it, but the Consciousness blames the Doctor for the destruction of its planet. The Nestene Consciousness activates all the Autons at a shopping arcade, where several shoppers are shot and killed, including Clive. The Doctor is also held down by a pair of Autons, but Rose rescues him and the anti-plastic drops into the vat where the Nestene Consciousness resides, killing it. With the Nestene Consciousness dead, the Autons all collapse. The Doctor uses the TARDIS to take Mickey and Rose home, then persuades Rose to join him as his new companion in the TARDIS.\n\n===Continuity===\nBoth the Autons and the Nestene Consciousness first appeared in the serial ''[[Spearhead from Space]]'' (1970), then reappeared on-screen in ''[[Terror of the Autons]]'' (1971).<ref name=\"4thdimension\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007vvcq/features/rose-the-fourth-dimension|title=The Fourth Dimension|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=24 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n{{see also|History of Doctor Who#The new series|l1=History of Doctor Who|Doctor Who (series_1)#Production|label 2=Doctor Who series 1 production}}\n\n=== Background and casting ===\n[[File:Russelltdaviescrop.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Russell T Davies]], episode writer.]]\n''Doctor Who'' originally ran from 1963 to 1989, when it was cancelled after its [[Doctor Who (season 26)|twenty-sixth season]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3140786.stm|title=Doctor Who returns to TV|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=26 September 2003|accessdate=23 November 2013}}</ref> Television producer [[Russell T Davies]] had been lobbying the BBC in an attempt to revive the show from the late 1990s, and reached the discussion phase in 2002.<ref name=\"revival\">Aldridge and Murray pp.182\u2013183</ref> It was announced in September 2003 that Doctor Who was returning and would be produced by [[BBC Wales]] via a BBC press release.<ref name=\"Press release\">{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2003/09_september/26/dr_who.shtml | title=Doctor Who returns to BBC ONE | work=BBC | date=26 September 2013 | accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref> The format of the programme was changed to 45-minute episodes, lightening the pace.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Cavan|last=Scott|title=The Way Back Part One: Bring Me to Life|journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]]|publisher=[[Panini Comics]]|location=[[Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent]]|issue=463|page=21|date=25 July 2013}}</ref> Davies was inspired by American series such as ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' and ''[[Smallville]]'', in particular by using ''Buffy''{{'s}} structure of season-long [[story arcs]] around a \"[[Big Bad]]\" villain.<ref>Aldridge and Murray, p. 208</ref>\n\nIt was announced in March 2004 that [[Christopher Eccleston]] would be playing the Doctor.<ref name=\"March 2004\"/> [[Jane Tranter]], BBC Controller of Drama Commissioning, stated that casting an actor of Eccleston's reputation signaled \"our intention to take ''Doctor Who'' into the 21st century, as well as retaining its core traditional values \u2014 to be surprising, edgy and eccentric.\"<ref name=\"March 2004\">{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/3552087.stm | title=Eccleston is new Doctor Who | work=BBC | date=22 March 2004 | accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref> Eccleston had previously worked with Davies on [[The Second Coming (TV serial)|The Second Coming]] and requested that Davies consider him for the role.<ref name=\"Shannon\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.shannonsullivan.com/drwho/serials/2005a.html|title=Rose|website=ShannonSulivan|accessdate=April 6, 2020}}</ref> Eccelston was attracted to the role as a way of shedding the image of him as a serious actor only.<ref name=\"Shannon\"/> Eccleston is the [[Ninth Doctor|ninth actor]] to play the Doctor since the programme started in 1963.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zFFpJEToGnMC&pg=PT152&dq|title=A Brief Guide to Doctor Who|author=Mark Campbell|publisher=Constable & Robinson Ltd|date= 24 Mar 2011|isbn=9781849018869}}</ref>  New actors are able to take over the role through a plot device of [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regeneration]], introduced in 1966, in which the character of the Doctor changes body and identity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8616413.stm|title=Doctor Who regeneration was 'modelled on LSD trips'|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=BBC|date=12 April 2010|accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref> Russell T Davies decided to begin the revived series with a new Doctor rather than show the regeneration, as he believed it was \"madness\" to start with someone and then change him before the audience could build a relationship with him.

The episode was directed by [[Keith Boak]] and written by [[Russell T Davies]] who was also one of the three executive producers. It was first broadcast in the UK on [[BBC One]] on 26 March 2005. \"Rose\" was the first ''Doctor Who'' episode to air since the [[Doctor Who (film)|''Doctor Who'' television film]] in 1996.\n\nIn the episode, the London department store worker [[Rose Tyler]] ([[Billie Piper]]) gets caught in the middle of the alien [[Time travel in fiction|time traveller]] [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]]'s ([[Christopher Eccleston]]) plot to prevent an invasion of the [[Earth]] by the [[Nestene Consciousness]] (voiced by [[Nicholas Briggs]]) and the [[Auton]]s after the Doctor destroys Rose's workplace.\n\nThe episode marked Eccleston's first appearance as the Doctor, succeeding several other actors who played the role, and Piper's debut as the Doctor's travelling [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] Rose. Being the first episode of the revived series, several recurring characters were introduced: [[Camille Coduri]] as [[Jackie Tyler]], and [[Noel Clarke]] as [[Mickey Smith]]. Viewers did not see the Doctor character regenerate from a previous incarnation, [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regeneration]] being a plot device in which the character of the Doctor changes appearance. Russell T Davies felt it would be clearer for the viewer to begin the series with the new actor in place rather than show the previous actor regenerating.\n\nLocation filming principally took place in Cardiff, the headquarters of [[BBC Wales]], in July and August 2004, with some location scenes shot in London in July. Studio work principally took place at the Unit Q2 warehouse in [[Newport, Wales|Newport]] in August and September. Model work was recorded at the [[BBC]]'s Model Unit in London in September, and some additional filming was recorded in Cardiff in October and November. \"Rose\" was viewed by 10.81 million viewers in the UK, the most viewed ''Doctor Who'' episode since ''[[The Creature from the Pit]]'' in 1979,<ref name=\"cultbox\">{{cite web|url=https://cultbox.co.uk/features/trivia/top-10-most-watched-doctor-who-episodes-since-2005|title=Top 10 most-watched 'Doctor Who' episodes since 2005|website=Cultbox|last=Martin|first=William|date=March 24, 2016|accessdate=February 16, 2020}}</ref> and received positive reviews from critics, though there were some criticisms of its use of humour.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Rose Tyler]], a teenage shop assistant, is chased by mannequins in the basement of Henrik's, the department store where she works. She is rescued by the [[Ninth Doctor]], who destroys the building with an explosion. The next day, the Doctor visits Rose at her home, where he is attacked by a plastic mannequin arm which he and Rose subdue. Rose investigates the Doctor and meets Clive, who has been tracking the Doctor's appearances throughout history. Clive tells Rose that the Doctor is dangerous and that if he's there, something bad is about to happen. While Rose is talking to Clive, her boyfriend [[Mickey Smith]] is kidnapped by a wheelie bin and replaced with a plastic [[doppelg\u00e4nger]].\n\nThe fake Mickey takes Rose to lunch and attempts to question her about the Doctor, but the Doctor shows up and beheads the doppelg\u00e4nger. The Doctor takes Rose and the plastic head to the [[TARDIS]] and attempts to use the head to locate the controlling signal. With the head connected, the TARDIS takes them to the [[London Eye]]. The Doctor explains to Rose that the fake Mickey was an [[Auton]], controlled by a signal from the Nestene Consciousness. He has a vial of anti-plastic that can be used to destroy the Nestene Consciousness if necessary. Realising that the transmitter is the London Eye itself, Rose and the Doctor descend underneath it to stop the Nestene Consciousness. They find Mickey, tied up but alive, and the Doctor speaks to the Nestene Consciousness. He tries to negotiate with it, but the Consciousness blames the Doctor for the destruction of its planet. The Nestene Consciousness activates all the Autons at a shopping arcade, where several shoppers are shot and killed, including Clive. The Doctor is also held down by a pair of Autons, but Rose rescues him and the anti-plastic drops into the vat where the Nestene Consciousness resides, killing it. With the Nestene Consciousness dead, the Autons all collapse. The Doctor uses the TARDIS to take Mickey and Rose home, then persuades Rose to join him as his new companion in the TARDIS.\n\n===Continuity===\nBoth the Autons and the Nestene Consciousness first appeared in the serial ''[[Spearhead from Space]]'' (1970), then reappeared on-screen in ''[[Terror of the Autons]]'' (1971).<ref name=\"4thdimension\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007vvcq/features/rose-the-fourth-dimension|title=The Fourth Dimension|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=24 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n{{see also|History of Doctor Who#The new series|l1=History of Doctor Who|Doctor Who (series_1)#Production|label 2=Doctor Who series 1 production}}\n\n=== Background and casting ===\n[[File:Russelltdaviescrop.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Russell T Davies]], episode writer.]]\n''Doctor Who'' originally ran from 1963 to 1989, when it was cancelled after its [[Doctor Who (season 26)|twenty-sixth season]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3140786.stm|title=Doctor Who returns to TV|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=26 September 2003|accessdate=23 November 2013}}</ref> Television producer [[Russell T Davies]] had been lobbying the BBC in an attempt to revive the show from the late 1990s, and reached the discussion phase in 2002.<ref name=\"revival\">Aldridge and Murray pp.182\u2013183</ref> It was announced in September 2003 that Doctor Who was returning and would be produced by [[BBC Wales]] via a BBC press release.<ref name=\"Press release\">{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2003/09_september/26/dr_who.shtml | title=Doctor Who returns to BBC ONE | work=BBC | date=26 September 2013 | accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref> The format of the programme was changed to 45-minute episodes, lightening the pace.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Cavan|last=Scott|title=The Way Back Part One: Bring Me to Life|journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]]|publisher=[[Panini Comics]]|location=[[Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent]]|issue=463|page=21|date=25 July 2013}}</ref> Davies was inspired by American series such as ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' and ''[[Smallville]]'', in particular by using ''Buffy''{{'s}} structure of season-long [[story arcs]] around a \"[[Big Bad]]\" villain.<ref>Aldridge and Murray, p. 208</ref>\n\nIt was announced in March 2004 that [[Christopher Eccleston]] would be playing the Doctor.<ref name=\"March 2004\"/> [[Jane Tranter]], BBC Controller of Drama Commissioning, stated that casting an actor of Eccleston's reputation signaled \"our intention to take ''Doctor Who'' into the 21st century, as well as retaining its core traditional values \u2014 to be surprising, edgy and eccentric.\"<ref name=\"March 2004\">{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/3552087.stm | title=Eccleston is new Doctor Who | work=BBC | date=22 March 2004 | accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref> Eccleston had previously worked with Davies on [[The Second Coming (TV serial)|The Second Coming]] and requested that Davies consider him for the role.<ref name=\"Shannon\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.shannonsullivan.com/drwho/serials/2005a.html|title=Rose|website=ShannonSulivan|accessdate=April 6, 2020}}</ref> Eccelston was attracted to the role as a way of shedding the image of him as a serious actor only.<ref name=\"Shannon\"/> Eccleston is the [[Ninth Doctor|ninth actor]] to play the Doctor since the programme started in 1963.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zFFpJEToGnMC&pg=PT152&dq|title=A Brief Guide to Doctor Who|author=Mark Campbell|publisher=Constable & Robinson Ltd|date= 24 Mar 2011|isbn=9781849018869}}</ref>  New actors are able to take over the role through a plot device of [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regeneration]], introduced in 1966, in which the character of the Doctor changes body and identity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8616413.stm|title=Doctor Who regeneration was 'modelled on LSD trips'|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=BBC|date=12 April 2010|accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref> Russell T Davies decided to begin the revived series with a new Doctor rather than show the regeneration, as he believed it was \"madness\" to start with someone and then change him before the audience could build a relationship with him.
