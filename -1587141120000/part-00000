It is a [[List of modernized retellings of old stories|modern adaptation]] of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s play ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'' and [[George Cukor]]'s 1964 film ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]''. It was one of the most popular [[teen film]]s of the late 1990s and reached No. 1 at the box office in its first week of release.<ref name=\"mojo\" />\n\n== Plot ==\nZackary Siler ([[Freddie Prinze Jr.]]) is the big man on campus at his [[Southern California]] [[high school]]. His popular and narcissistic girlfriend, Taylor Vaughan ([[Jodi Lyn O'Keefe]]), ditches him for a crude reality TV star from ''[[The Real World]]'', Brock Hudson ([[Matthew Lillard]]), whom she met on Spring Break in Florida. Zack consoles himself, claiming that Taylor is replaceable by any girl in the school. Zack's friend, Dean Sampson, Jr. ([[Paul Walker]]), disagrees and challenges him to a bet on whether Zack can turn any random girl into the Prom Queen within six weeks. Dean chooses Laney Boggs ([[Rachael Leigh Cook]]), a dorky, solitary, unpopular art student.\n\nZack attempts to befriend Laney, but fails utterly, as she pointedly ignores his advances and walks away. Zack's sister Mac ([[Anna Paquin]]) encourages him to try again, and make a proper effort to get to learn what Laney is interested in and cares about. Zack approaches Laney again at her workplace and with the help of Laney's childhood friend, Jesse Jackson ([[Elden Henson]]) convinces her to give him a chance. Laney takes him to a small theater lounge where she will be performing. Intending to deter him, Laney has Zack called on stage to perform. Zack manages to improvise a show with the [[Hacky Sack]] he happens to carry in his pocket. Laney is impressed by the performance, but rejects him again after he attempts to charm her.\n\nZack befriends her brother, Simon ([[Kieran Culkin]]), and in an attempt to stop this, Laney agrees to go to the beach with him once. Dean unexpectedly shows up with the popular crowd, and Laney gets a chance to know them all. Preston ([[Dul\u00e9 Hill]]) invites them to a party at his house that night. Laney pretends to be busy but Zack persuades her go, and enlists his sister to give her a makeover, transforming her and revealing her true beauty. At Preston's, Taylor is embarrassed by Brock and jealous of Laney, who she publicly humiliates and brings her to tears. Outside Zack consoles Laney, telling her that by opening up to people there will be some bad with the good.\n\nNewly popular, Laney is surprised to be nominated for Prom Queen and competes with Taylor for the crown. Zack and Laney begin to genuinely fall for each other; Taylor is humiliated when Brock ends their relationship, as he is leaving for [[Road Rules: All Stars]]. Dean begins to show an interest in Laney, aggravating Zack. Dean tries to invite Laney to prom, but she refuses. After falling out with Zack, Dean deliberately tells Laney about the bet and she forces a confession from Zack in public. Humiliated, Laney refuses to see Zack again.\n\nUnable to reconcile with Laney, Zack takes his sister to the prom, while Taylor arrives alone, thinking that Zack is still interested in her despite his refusal of her advances. A disheartened Laney reluctantly dresses up after some persuasion from her father Wayne ([[Kevin Pollak]]) and goes to the dance with Dean after he shows up at her house in a tuxedo to invite her again to be his prom date.\n\nAt the prom, after a dance scene presided over by the school's resident DJ ([[Usher (entertainer)|Usher Raymond]]), Mac meets Jesse and they become friends. In the bathroom Dean boasts that he is succeeding in seducing Laney and has rented a hotel room with intention of having sex with her. Jesse overhears, and tries to tell Mac and they rush to warn Zack. Taylor is crowned Prom Queen with just over half the votes. Laney is magnanimous, as she believes the right person won, and leaves the prom with Dean. Zack attempts to intervene but is too late and loses track of them.\n\nLaney returns home, to find her father and Simon waiting up for her, and Zack is there waiting too. Laney explains how she fought off Dean's advances by deafening him with an [[Air horn#Portable or personal air horns|air horn]]. Zack confesses his true feelings to Laney, and asks for forgiveness as well as the chance to further their relationship, which she grants and the two officially become a couple. Laney tells Zack that she is considering art school after graduation, and Zack jokingly tells her that she has inspired him to pursue a career in performance art. After they dance and kiss, Laney asks Zack about the bet, and Zack responds that he will honor the terms.\n\nAt the graduation ceremony, it is revealed, that Zack must appear nude on stage. Zack is wearing only a graduation cap and strategically carrying a [[soccer ball]] to cover himself. Zack takes the stage, Laney catches the soccer ball and reacts with a smile, as the students applaud.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Freddie Prinze, Jr.]] as Zachary \"Zack\" Siler\n* [[Rachael Leigh Cook]] as Laney Boggs\n* [[Paul Walker]] as Dean Sampson, Jr.\n* [[Matthew Lillard]] as Brock Hudson\n* [[Jodi Lyn O'Keefe]] as Taylor Vaughan\n* [[Kevin Pollak]] as Wayne Boggs\n* [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher Raymond]] as Campus DJ\n* [[Lil' Kim|Kimberly \"Lil' Kim\" Jones]] as Alex Chason Sawyer\n* [[Anna Paquin]] as Mackenzie \"Mac\" Siler\n* [[Kieran Culkin]] as Simon Boggs\n* [[Elden Henson]] as Jesse Jackson\n* [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] as Girl in Cafeteria (''uncredited'')<ref name=\"Greco\" /><ref name=\"Macatee\" />{{efn|Named in the credits under ''The Producers Wish To Thank'', subsection ''They're All That''.}}\n* [[Gabrielle Union]] as Katarina \"Katie\" Darlingson\n* [[Dul\u00e9 Hill]] as Preston\n* [[Tamara Mello]] as Chandler\n* [[Clea DuVall]] as Misty\n* [[Tim Matheson]] as Harlan Siler\n* [[Alexis Arquette]] as Mitch\n* [[Chris Owen (actor)|Chris Owen]] as Derek Funkhouser Rutley\n* [[Vanessa Lee Chester]] as Melissa's Friend\n* [[Milo Ventimiglia]] as Soccer Player\n* [[Takbir Bashir]] as Rapper\n* [[Brandon Mychal Smith]] as JV Cleaning Boy\n* [[Flex Alexander]] as Kadeem\n* [[Debbi Morgan]] as Laney's Art Teacher\n* [[Carlos Jacott]] as Prom Photographer\n* [[Michael Milhoan]] as Principal Stickley\n* [[Patricia Charbonneau]] as Lois Siler\n* Katharine Towne as Savannah\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n{{Anchor|Casting}}\nThe film had an impressive ensemble cast of up-and-coming actors, including Kieran Culkin, Oscar winner Anna Paquin, musician Usher Raymond, Gabrielle Union in her film debut, Dul\u00e9 Hill and [[Lil' Kim]].

It was one of the most popular [[teen film]]s of the late 1990s and reached No. 1 at the box office in its first week of release.<ref name=\"mojo\" />\n\n== Plot ==\nZackary Siler ([[Freddie Prinze Jr.]]) is the big man on campus at his [[Southern California]] [[high school]]. His popular and narcissistic girlfriend, Taylor Vaughan ([[Jodi Lyn O'Keefe]]), ditches him for a crude reality TV star from ''[[The Real World]]'', Brock Hudson ([[Matthew Lillard]]), whom she met on Spring Break in Florida. Zack consoles himself, claiming that Taylor is replaceable by any girl in the school. Zack's friend, Dean Sampson, Jr. ([[Paul Walker]]), disagrees and challenges him to a bet on whether Zack can turn any random girl into the Prom Queen within six weeks. Dean chooses Laney Boggs ([[Rachael Leigh Cook]]), a dorky, solitary, unpopular art student.\n\nZack attempts to befriend Laney, but fails utterly, as she pointedly ignores his advances and walks away. Zack's sister Mac ([[Anna Paquin]]) encourages him to try again, and make a proper effort to get to learn what Laney is interested in and cares about. Zack approaches Laney again at her workplace and with the help of Laney's childhood friend, Jesse Jackson ([[Elden Henson]]) convinces her to give him a chance. Laney takes him to a small theater lounge where she will be performing. Intending to deter him, Laney has Zack called on stage to perform. Zack manages to improvise a show with the [[Hacky Sack]] he happens to carry in his pocket. Laney is impressed by the performance, but rejects him again after he attempts to charm her.\n\nZack befriends her brother, Simon ([[Kieran Culkin]]), and in an attempt to stop this, Laney agrees to go to the beach with him once. Dean unexpectedly shows up with the popular crowd, and Laney gets a chance to know them all. Preston ([[Dul\u00e9 Hill]]) invites them to a party at his house that night. Laney pretends to be busy but Zack persuades her go, and enlists his sister to give her a makeover, transforming her and revealing her true beauty. At Preston's, Taylor is embarrassed by Brock and jealous of Laney, who she publicly humiliates and brings her to tears. Outside Zack consoles Laney, telling her that by opening up to people there will be some bad with the good.\n\nNewly popular, Laney is surprised to be nominated for Prom Queen and competes with Taylor for the crown. Zack and Laney begin to genuinely fall for each other; Taylor is humiliated when Brock ends their relationship, as he is leaving for [[Road Rules: All Stars]]. Dean begins to show an interest in Laney, aggravating Zack. Dean tries to invite Laney to prom, but she refuses. After falling out with Zack, Dean deliberately tells Laney about the bet and she forces a confession from Zack in public. Humiliated, Laney refuses to see Zack again.\n\nUnable to reconcile with Laney, Zack takes his sister to the prom, while Taylor arrives alone, thinking that Zack is still interested in her despite his refusal of her advances. A disheartened Laney reluctantly dresses up after some persuasion from her father Wayne ([[Kevin Pollak]]) and goes to the dance with Dean after he shows up at her house in a tuxedo to invite her again to be his prom date.\n\nAt the prom, after a dance scene presided over by the school's resident DJ ([[Usher (entertainer)|Usher Raymond]]), Mac meets Jesse and they become friends. In the bathroom Dean boasts that he is succeeding in seducing Laney and has rented a hotel room with intention of having sex with her. Jesse overhears, and tries to tell Mac and they rush to warn Zack. Taylor is crowned Prom Queen with just over half the votes. Laney is magnanimous, as she believes the right person won, and leaves the prom with Dean. Zack attempts to intervene but is too late and loses track of them.\n\nLaney returns home, to find her father and Simon waiting up for her, and Zack is there waiting too. Laney explains how she fought off Dean's advances by deafening him with an [[Air horn#Portable or personal air horns|air horn]]. Zack confesses his true feelings to Laney, and asks for forgiveness as well as the chance to further their relationship, which she grants and the two officially become a couple. Laney tells Zack that she is considering art school after graduation, and Zack jokingly tells her that she has inspired him to pursue a career in performance art. After they dance and kiss, Laney asks Zack about the bet, and Zack responds that he will honor the terms.\n\nAt the graduation ceremony, it is revealed, that Zack must appear nude on stage. Zack is wearing only a graduation cap and strategically carrying a [[soccer ball]] to cover himself. Zack takes the stage, Laney catches the soccer ball and reacts with a smile, as the students applaud.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Freddie Prinze, Jr.]] as Zachary \"Zack\" Siler\n* [[Rachael Leigh Cook]] as Laney Boggs\n* [[Paul Walker]] as Dean Sampson, Jr.\n* [[Matthew Lillard]] as Brock Hudson\n* [[Jodi Lyn O'Keefe]] as Taylor Vaughan\n* [[Kevin Pollak]] as Wayne Boggs\n* [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher Raymond]] as Campus DJ\n* [[Lil' Kim|Kimberly \"Lil' Kim\" Jones]] as Alex Chason Sawyer\n* [[Anna Paquin]] as Mackenzie \"Mac\" Siler\n* [[Kieran Culkin]] as Simon Boggs\n* [[Elden Henson]] as Jesse Jackson\n* [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] as Girl in Cafeteria (''uncredited'')<ref name=\"Greco\" /><ref name=\"Macatee\" />{{efn|Named in the credits under ''The Producers Wish To Thank'', subsection ''They're All That''.}}\n* [[Gabrielle Union]] as Katarina \"Katie\" Darlingson\n* [[Dul\u00e9 Hill]] as Preston\n* [[Tamara Mello]] as Chandler\n* [[Clea DuVall]] as Misty\n* [[Tim Matheson]] as Harlan Siler\n* [[Alexis Arquette]] as Mitch\n* [[Chris Owen (actor)|Chris Owen]] as Derek Funkhouser Rutley\n* [[Vanessa Lee Chester]] as Melissa's Friend\n* [[Milo Ventimiglia]] as Soccer Player\n* [[Takbir Bashir]] as Rapper\n* [[Brandon Mychal Smith]] as JV Cleaning Boy\n* [[Flex Alexander]] as Kadeem\n* [[Debbi Morgan]] as Laney's Art Teacher\n* [[Carlos Jacott]] as Prom Photographer\n* [[Michael Milhoan]] as Principal Stickley\n* [[Patricia Charbonneau]] as Lois Siler\n* Katharine Towne as Savannah\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n{{Anchor|Casting}}\nThe film had an impressive ensemble cast of up-and-coming actors, including Kieran Culkin, Oscar winner Anna Paquin, musician Usher Raymond, Gabrielle Union in her film debut, Dul\u00e9 Hill and [[Lil' Kim]].

Many argued that Schumacher did not need to be \"given\" wins in only the 6th race of the season, particularly given that he had already won four of the previous five Grands Prix, and that Barrichello had dominated the race weekend up to that point. At the podium ceremony, Schumacher pushed Barrichello onto the top step,<ref name=\"bbcaustria\" /> and for this disturbance, the Ferrari team incurred a US$1&nbsp;million fine.<ref>{{cite news | title = Record fine for Turks |agency=Reuters | url = http://www.eurosport.co.uk/formula1/sport_sto967344.shtml | accessdate =24 October 2006}}</ref> Later in the season at the end of the [[2002 United States Grand Prix]], Schumacher slowed down within sight of the finishing line, allowing Barrichello to win by 0.011 seconds, the 2nd closest margin in F1 history.

While trying to set his flying lap in qualifying, Schumacher encountered Warwick's [[Jaguar XJR-14|Jaguar]] on a slow lap resulting in lost time for Schumacher. As retaliation for being in his way, Schumacher swerved the Sauber into Warwick's car, hitting the Jaguar's nose and front wheel. Enraged by the German's attitude, Warwick drove to the pits and chased a fleeing Schumacher on foot through the Sauber pits. He eventually caught up with Schumacher, and it took intervention from [[Jochen Mass]] to prevent Warwick physically assaulting Schumacher.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.autosport.com/journal/article.php/id/347/|title=Schumacher at Sauber|magazine=Autosport |date=February 2005|accessdate=17 December 2012|first=Gary|last=Watkins}}</ref>\n\nToward the end of the [[2010 Hungarian Grand Prix]], [[Rubens Barrichello]] attempted to pass Schumacher down the inside on the main straight. Schumacher closed the inside line to force Barrichello onto the outside, but Barrichello persisted on the inside at {{convert|180|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, despite the close proximity of a concrete wall and Schumacher leaving him only inches to spare. Barrichello said \"It is the most dangerous thing that I have been through\", and \"There is not a rule for that, but between ourselves we should take a line, stick to it and that's it.\" Schumacher said that \"Obviously there was space enough to go through. We didn't touch, so I guess I just left enough space for him to come through.\" Ross Brawn said \"at the end of the day he gave him enough space. You can argue that it was marginal, but it was just tough \u2013 tough racing.\" A range of ex-drivers and commentators were highly critical of Schumacher. Although there was no accident, the race steward, the same Derek Warwick of the 1991 N\u00fcrburgring incident, wanted to black flag Schumacher since that \"would have shown a better example to our young drivers\". The Hungaroring incident was ruled to be dangerous and Schumacher received a 10 place grid penalty for the [[2010 Belgian Grand Prix|next race]].

Barrichello said \"It is the most dangerous thing that I have been through\", and \"There is not a rule for that, but between ourselves we should take a line, stick to it and that's it.\" Schumacher said that \"Obviously there was space enough to go through. We didn't touch, so I guess I just left enough space for him to come through.\" Ross Brawn said \"at the end of the day he gave him enough space. You can argue that it was marginal, but it was just tough \u2013 tough racing.\" A range of ex-drivers and commentators were highly critical of Schumacher. Although there was no accident, the race steward, the same Derek Warwick of the 1991 N\u00fcrburgring incident, wanted to black flag Schumacher since that \"would have shown a better example to our young drivers\". The Hungaroring incident was ruled to be dangerous and Schumacher received a 10 place grid penalty for the [[2010 Belgian Grand Prix|next race]].

Having served as Minister for Forests and Agriculture, he ascended to Federal Chancellor in 1932 in the midst of a crisis for the conservative government. In early 1933, he shut down parliament and assumed dictatorial powers. Suppressing the Socialist movement in February 1934 during the [[Austrian Civil War]] and later banning the [[Austrian National Socialism|Austrian Nazi party]], he cemented the rule of \"[[Austrofascism]]\" through the [[authoritarian]] ''[[May Constitution of 1934|First of May Constitution]]''. Dollfuss was assassinated as part of a failed coup attempt by [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] agents in 1934. His successor [[Kurt Schuschnigg]] maintained the regime until [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Anschluss|annexation of Austria]] in 1938.\n\n== Early life ==\n\n[[File:2009-09-19 Dr. Dollfu\u00df Museum in Texing, Outside.jpg|thumb|left|Dollfuss' birthplace in Texing]]\n\nDollfuss was born to a poor, peasant family in the hamlet of Great Maierhof in the commune of St. Gotthard near [[Texingtal]] in [[Lower Austria]]. Young Dollfuss spent his childhood in his step-father's house in the nearby commune of Kirnberg,{{sfn|Messner|2004|p=25}} where he also went to elementary school. The local parish priests helped to finance Dollfuss' education, as his parents were unable to do so by themselves alone.{{sfn|Messner|2004|p=26}} He attended high school in [[Hollabrunn]].{{sfn|Messner|2004|p=27}} After graduating from high school, Dollfuss intended to become a priest, and thus he enrolled at the [[University of Vienna]] to study theology, but after a few months changed course and started studying law in 1912. As a student, he earned a livelihood giving lessons.{{sfn|Messner|2004|p=28}} He became a member of the Students' Social Movement, a student organisation dedicated to social and charitable work among the workers.{{sfn|Messner|2004|p=29}}\n\nAs the [[World War I]] broke out, Dollfuss reported to be recruited in Vienna but was rejected because he was two centimetres shorter than the minimum. The same day he went to [[St. P\u00f6lten]] where the recruiting commission for his district was located and insisted to be recruited, even though he did not meet the minimum height standards, and was accepted. As a volunteer, he had a right to choose a regiment in which he would serve, and Dollfuss opted for the Tyrolese militia also known as the ''[[Kaisersch\u00fctzen]]''.{{sfn|Messner|2004|p=29}} He was soon promoted to the rank of [[corporal]]. He served for 37 months at the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]], south of Tyrol. By 1916 he was promoted to [[lieutenant]].{{sfn|Messner|2004|p=30}}\n\nAfter the war, he was still a student and was employed by the Lower Austrian Peasants' Union, which helped him to secure his material existence, and it was here where Dollfuss gained his first political experience. There, he organised peasants to help them recover from the war, as well as shield them from the influences of [[Marxism]]. Being recognised for his abilities he showed at the Union, he was sent for further studies to [[Berlin]]. In Berlin, he began to garner dislike for some of his professors, as academia there was substantially influenced by liberalism and socialism. In his studies, he devoted himself to the Christian principles of economics. In Germany, he became a member of the Federation of German Peasants' Union and of the Preussenkasse &ndash; essentially, a central bank for member-cooperatives, where he gained practical experience. In Germany, he met his future wife [[Alwine_Dollfu\u00df|Alwine Glienke]], a descendant of a [[Pomerania|Pomeranian]] family. Dollfuss often met with [[Carl Sonnenschein]], leader of social activities of students and the pioneer of the Catholic movement in Berlin.{{sfn|Messner|2004|p=33}}\n\nAfter returning to Vienna, he was a secretary of the Lower Austrian Peasants' Union. He devoted his efforts to consolidate that industry. Dollfuss was instrumental in the founding of the regional Chamber of Agriculture of Lower Austria, becoming its secretary and a director; the Federation of Agriculture and the Agricultural Labourers\u2019 Insurance Institute; in organising the new Agrarian policy of Lower Austria and in laying the foundations for the corporative organisation of agriculture. A few years later, he was representative of Austria at the International Agrarian Congress, where his proposals made him internationally known in that sphere. He was seen as an unofficial leader of the Austrian peasantry.{{sfn|Messner|2004|p=34}}\n\nOn 1 October 1930 Dollfuss was appointed the president of the Federal Railways, the largest industrial corporation in Austria. There, Dollfuss came into contact with all branches of the industry.{{sfn|Messner|2004|p=34}} In March 1931, he was appointed Federal Minister of Agriculture and Forestry.{{sfn|Messner|2004|p=35}}\n\n== Chancellor of Austria ==\n\nOn 10 May 1932, Dollfuss, age 39 and with only one year's experience in the [[Government of Austria|Federal Government]], was offered the office of [[Chancellor of Austria|Chancellor]] by President [[Wilhelm Miklas]], also a member of the Christian-Social Party. Dollfuss refused to reply, instead spending the night in his favourite church praying, returning in the morning for a bath and a spartan meal before replying to the President he would accept the offer.<ref name=\"Eve\">{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,882197-3,00.html | work=Time | title=AUSTRIA: Eve of Renewal | date=September 25, 1933}}</ref> Dollfuss was sworn in on 20 May 1932 as head of a [[coalition government]] between the Christian-Social Party, the [[Landbund]] \u2014 a [[right-wing]] [[agrarianism|agrarian]] party \u2014 and [[Heimwehr|Heimatblock]], the parliamentary wing of the ''[[Heimwehr]]'', a [[paramilitary]] [[ultra-nationalist]] group. The coalition assumed the pressing task of tackling the problems of the [[Great Depression]]. Much of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]'s industry had been situated in the areas that became part of [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Yugoslavia]] after [[World War I]] as a result of the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain]]. Postwar Austria was therefore economically disadvantaged.\n\nDollfuss' majority in [[Federal Assembly of Austria|Parliament]] was marginal; his government had only a one-vote majority.<ref>{{Cite book|title=\u00d6sterreich I (Die untersch\u00e4tzte Republik) |last=Portisch |first=Hugo| author2=Sepp Riff |year=1989 |publisher=Verlag Kremayr und Scheriau |location=Vienna, Austria |isbn=3-218-00485-3 |page=415}}</ref>\n\n== Dollfuss as dictator of Austria ==\n\n[[File:DollfussEnGinebra1933.jpeg|thumb|Chancellor Dollfuss in [[Geneva]], 1933]]\n{{main|Self-elimination of the Austrian Parliament}}\nIn March 1933, an argument arose over irregularities in the voting procedure. The Social Democratic president of the [[National Council of Austria|National Council]] (the lower house of parliament) [[Karl Renner]] resigned to be able to cast a vote as a parliament member. As a consequence, the two vice presidents, belonging to other parties, resigned as well to be able to vote. Without a president, the parliament could not conclude the session. Dollfuss took the three resignations as a pretext to declare that the National Council had become unworkable, and advised [[President of Austria|President]] [[Wilhelm Miklas]] to issue a decree adjourning it indefinitely. When the National Council wanted to reconvene days after the resignation of the three presidents, Dollfuss had police bar entrance to parliament, effectively eliminating democracy in Austria. From that point onwards, he governed as dictator by emergency decree with absolute power.\n\nDollfuss was concerned that with [[NSDAP|German National Socialist]] leader [[Adolf Hitler]] becoming Chancellor of Germany in 1933, the [[Austrian National Socialism|Austrian National Socialists]] (DNSAP) could gain a significant minority in future elections (according to fascism scholar [[Stanley G. Payne]], should elections have been held in 1933, the DNSAP could have mustered about 25% of the votes \u2013 contemporary [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] analysts suggest a higher support of 50%, with a 75% approval rate in the [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] region bordering Nazi Germany).<ref>Stanley G. Payne, ''A History of Fascism 1914-1945''</ref><ref name=\"Eve\"/> In addition, the Soviet Union's influence in Europe had increased throughout the 1920s and early 1930s. Dollfuss banned the communists on 26 May 1933 and the DNSAP on 19 June 1933. Under the banner of [[Christian Social Party (Austria)|Christian Social Party]], he later established a one-party dictatorship rule largely modeled after fascism in Italy, banning all other Austrian parties including the Social Democratic Labour Party (SDAP\u00d6). Social Democrats however continued to exist as an independent organization, nevertheless, without its paramilitary ''[[Republikanischer Schutzbund]]'', which until 31 March 1933<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.doew.braintrust.at/m9sm101.html|title=D\u00f6W - Documentation Center of Austrian Resistance|work=braintrust.at|accessdate=5 July 2015}}</ref> could have mustered tens of thousands against Dollfuss' government.\n\n=== Austrofascism ===\n\nDollfuss modelled [[Austrofascism]] according to [[Catholic]] [[corporatist]] ideals with [[clericalism|anti-secularist]] tones and in a similar way to Italian [[fascism]], dropping Austrian pretenses of unification with Germany as long as the Nazi Party remained in power. In August 1933, [[Benito Mussolini]]'s regime issued a guarantee of Austrian independence. Dollfuss also exchanged 'Secret Letters' with Mussolini about ways to guarantee Austrian independence. Mussolini was interested in Austria forming a buffer zone against Nazi Germany. Dollfuss always stressed the similarity of the regimes of Hitler in Germany and [[Joseph Stalin]] in the Soviet Union, and was convinced that Austrofascism and Italian fascism could counter [[totalitarian]] national socialism and communism in Europe.\n\nIn September 1933 Dollfuss merged his Christian Social Party with elements of other nationalist and conservative groups, including the Heimwehr, which encompassed many workers who were unhappy with the radical leadership of the socialist party, to form the ''[[Fatherland Front (Austria)|Vaterl\u00e4ndische Front]]'', though the Heimwehr continued to exist as an independent organization until 1936, when Dollfuss' successor [[Kurt von Schuschnigg]] forcibly merged it into the Front, instead creating the unabidingly loyal ''Frontmiliz'' as paramilitary task force. Dollfuss escaped an assassination attempt in October 1933 by [[Rudolf Dertill]], a 22-year-old who had been ejected from the military for his national socialist views.\n\n=== Austrian civil war ===\n\nIn February 1934 the security forces provoked arrests of Social Democrats and unjustified{{clarify|date=November 2019}} searches for weapons of the Social Democrats' already outlawed [[Republikanischer Schutzbund]]. After the Dollfuss dictatorship took steps against known Social Democrats, the Social Democrats called for nationwide resistance against the government. [[Austrian Civil War|A civil war]] began, which lasted sixteen days, from 12 until 27 February. Fierce fighting took place primarily in the East of Austria, especially in the streets of some outer [[Vienna]] districts, where large fortress-like [[Gemeindebau|municipal workers' buildings]] were situated, and in the northern, industrial areas of the province of [[Styria]], where Nazi agents{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} had great interest in a bloodbath between security forces and workers' militias. The resistance was suppressed by police and military power. The Social Democrats were outlawed,<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IaaJAAAAMAAJ&q=Sozialdemokratische+Partei+verboten+1934 |title=Protokolle des Ministerrates der Ersten Republik, Volume 8, Part 6 |isbn=3-7046-0004-0 |page=xvii |year=1985 |language=de |accessdate=2018-03-04|last1=Ministerrat |first1=Austria |last2=Neck |first2=Rudolf |last3=Wandruszka |first3=Adam |last4=Ackerl |first4=Isabella }}</ref> and their leaders were imprisoned or fled abroad.\n\n=== New constitution ===\n\nDollfuss staged a parliamentary session with just his party members present in April 1934 to [[May Constitution of 1934|have his new constitution approved]], effectively the second constitution in the world espousing [[corporatist]] ideas after that of the Portuguese ''[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]''.<ref>Stanley G.

Mussolini, known as \"Il Duce\", personally gave the announcement to Dollfuss's widow, who was a guest at his villa in [[Riccione]] with her children. He also put at the disposal of [[Ernst R\u00fcdiger Starhemberg]], who spent a holiday in [[Venice]], a plane that allowed the prince to rush back to Vienna and to face the assailants with his militia, with the permission of President [[Wilhelm Miklas]].<ref>Richard Lamb, ''Mussolini and the British'', 1997, p. 149</ref>\n\nMussolini also mobilised a part of the Italian army on the Austrian border and threatened Hitler with war in the event of a German invasion of Austria to thwart the putsch. Then he announced to the world: \"The independence of Austria, for which he has fallen, is a principle that has been defended and will be defended by Italy even more strenuously\", and then replaced in the main square of [[Bolzano]] the statue<ref>[[:de:Walther-Denkmal (Bozen)]]</ref> of [[Walther von der Vogelweide]], a Germanic troubadour, with that of [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]], a Roman general who conquered part of Germany. This was the greatest moment of friction between Italian Fascism and National Socialism and Mussolini himself came down several times to reaffirm the differences in the field. The assassination of Dollfuss was accompanied by uprisings in many regions in Austria, resulting in further deaths. In [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], a large contingent of northern German Nazis tried to seize power but were subdued by the Italian units nearby. At first Hitler was jubilant, but the Italian reaction surprised him. Hitler became convinced that he could not face a conflict with the Western European powers, and he officially denied liability, stating his regret for the murder of the Austrian Prime Minister. He replaced the ambassador to Vienna with [[Franz von Papen]] and prevented the conspirators entering Germany, also expelling them from the Austrian Nazi Party. The Nazi assassins in Vienna, after declaring the formation of a new government under Austrian Nazi [[Anton Rintelen]], previously exiled by Dollfuss as Austrian Ambassador to Rome, surrendered after threats from the Austrian military of blowing up the Chancellery using [[dynamite]], and were subsequently tried and executed by [[hanging]].<ref name=\"Death\"/> [[Kurt Schuschnigg]], previously Minister of Education, was appointed new chancellor of Austria after a few days, assuming the office from Dollfuss\u2019 deputy Starhemberg.\n\nOut of a population of 6.5 million, approximately 500,000 Austrians were present at Dollfuss\u2019 burial in [[Vienna]].<ref name=\"Death\"/> He is interred in the [[Hietzing]] cemetery in Vienna<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.viennatouristguide.at/Friedhoefe/Hietzing/Ehrengraeber/z_dollfuss.htm |title=Vienna Tourist Guide: Dollfuss Hietzinger Friedhof |publisher=Hedwig Abraham  |accessdate=6 February 2010}} (includes photographs)</ref> beside his wife [[Alwine Dollfu\u00df|Alwine Dollfuss]] (d. 1973) and two of his children, Hannerl and Eva, all of whom were in Italy as guests of [[Rachele Mussolini]] at the time of his death, an event which saw Mussolini himself shed tears over his slain ally.<ref name=\"Eve\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aspetos.at/de/traueranzeige/rudolf_dollfuss |title=Rudolf Dollfu\u00df - Traueranzeige und Parte \u2020 05.11.2011 - ASPETOS |accessdate=January 22, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428114838/http://www.aspetos.at/de/traueranzeige/rudolf_dollfuss |archive-date=2012-04-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== In literature ==\n\nIn [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s 1941 play ''[[The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui]]'', Dollfuss is represented by the character \"Dullfeet\".<ref name=\"The New York Times - 9 May 1991- Review/Theater; Brecht's Cauliflower King In Another Resistible Rise\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/09/theater/review-theater-brecht-s-cauliflower-king-in-another-resistible-rise.html|title=Review/Theater; Brecht's Cauliflower King In Another Resistible Rise|last=[[Mel Gussow]]|date=May 9, 1991|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=24 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Works ==\n\n* ''Das Kammersystem in der Landwirtschaft \u00d6sterreichs''.

4 October 1892 \u2013 25 July 1934) was an Austrian politician who served as Chancellor of [[Federal State of Austria|Austria]] between 1932 and 1934. Having served as Minister for Forests and Agriculture, he ascended to Federal Chancellor in 1932 in the midst of a crisis for the conservative government. In early 1933, he shut down parliament and assumed dictatorial powers. Suppressing the Socialist movement in February 1934 during the [[Austrian Civil War]] and later banning the [[Austrian National Socialism|Austrian Nazi party]], he cemented the rule of \"[[Austrofascism]]\" through the [[authoritarian]] ''[[May Constitution of 1934|First of May Constitution]]''. Dollfuss was assassinated as part of a failed coup attempt by [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] agents in 1934. His successor [[Kurt Schuschnigg]] maintained the regime until [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Anschluss|annexation of Austria]] in 1938.\n\n== Early life ==\n\n[[File:2009-09-19 Dr. Dollfu\u00df Museum in Texing, Outside.jpg|thumb|left|Dollfuss' birthplace in Texing]]\n\nDollfuss was born to a poor, peasant family in the hamlet of Great Maierhof in the commune of St. Gotthard near [[Texingtal]] in [[Lower Austria]]. Young Dollfuss spent his childhood in his step-father's house in the nearby commune of Kirnberg,{{sfn|Messner|2004|p=25}} where he also went to elementary school. The local parish priests helped to finance Dollfuss' education, as his parents were unable to do so by themselves alone.{{sfn|Messner|2004|p=26}} He attended high school in [[Hollabrunn]].{{sfn|Messner|2004|p=27}} After graduating from high school, Dollfuss intended to become a priest, and thus he enrolled at the [[University of Vienna]] to study theology, but after a few months changed course and started studying law in 1912. As a student, he earned a livelihood giving lessons.{{sfn|Messner|2004|p=28}} He became a member of the Students' Social Movement, a student organisation dedicated to social and charitable work among the workers.{{sfn|Messner|2004|p=29}}\n\nAs the [[World War I]] broke out, Dollfuss reported to be recruited in Vienna but was rejected because he was two centimetres shorter than the minimum. The same day he went to [[St. P\u00f6lten]] where the recruiting commission for his district was located and insisted to be recruited, even though he didn't meet the minimum height standards, and was accepted. As a volunteer, he had a right to choose a regiment in which he would serve, and Dollfuss opted for the Tyrolese militia also known as the ''[[Kaisersch\u00fctzen]]''.{{sfn|Messner|2004|p=29}} He was soon promoted to the rank of [[corporal]]. He served for 37 months at the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]], south of Tyrol. By 1916 he was promoted to [[lieutenant]].{{sfn|Messner|2004|p=30}}\n\nAfter the war, he was still a student and was employed by the Lower Austrian Peasants' Union, which helped him to secure his material existence, and it was here where Dollfuss gained his first political experience. There, he organised peasants to help them recover from the war, as well as shield them from the influences of [[Marxism]]. Being recognised for his abilities he showed at the Union, he was sent for further studies to [[Berlin]]. In Berlin, he began to garner dislike for some of his professors, as academia there was substantially influenced by liberalism and socialism. In his studies, he devoted himself to the Christian principles of economics. In Germany, he became a member of the Federation of German Peasants' Union and of the Preussenkasse &ndash; essentially, a central bank for member-cooperatives, where he gained practical experience. In Germany, he met his future wife [[Alwine_Dollfu\u00df|Alwine Glienke]], a descendant of a [[Pomerania|Pomeranian]] family. Dollfuss often met with [[Carl Sonnenschein]], leader of social activities of students and the pioneer of the Catholic movement in Berlin.{{sfn|Messner|2004|p=33}}\n\nAfter returning to Vienna, he was a secretary of the Lower Austrian Peasants' Union. He devoted his efforts to consolidate that industry. Dollfuss was instrumental in the founding of the regional Chamber of Agriculture of Lower Austria, becoming its secretary and a director; the Federation of Agriculture and the Agricultural Labourers\u2019 Insurance Institute; in organising the new Agrarian policy of Lower Austria and in laying the foundations for the corporative organisation of agriculture. A few years later, he was representative of Austria at the International Agrarian Congress, where his proposals made him internationally known in that sphere. He was seen as an unofficial leader of the Austrian peasantry.{{sfn|Messner|2004|p=34}}\n\nOn 1 October 1930 Dollfuss was appointed the president of the Federal Railways, the largest industrial corporation in Austria. There, Dollfuss came into contact with all branches of the industry.{{sfn|Messner|2004|p=34}} In March 1931, he was appointed Federal Minister of Agriculture and Forestry.{{sfn|Messner|2004|p=35}}\n\n== Chancellor of Austria ==\n\nOn 10 May 1932, Dollfuss, age 39 and with only one year's experience in the [[Government of Austria|Federal Government]], was offered the office of [[Chancellor of Austria|Chancellor]] by President [[Wilhelm Miklas]], also a member of the Christian-Social Party. Dollfuss refused to reply, instead spending the night in his favourite church praying, returning in the morning for a bath and a spartan meal before replying to the President he would accept the offer.<ref name=\"Eve\">{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,882197-3,00.html | work=Time | title=AUSTRIA: Eve of Renewal | date=September 25, 1933}}</ref> Dollfuss was sworn in on 20 May 1932 as head of a [[coalition government]] between the Christian-Social Party, the [[Landbund]] \u2014 a [[right-wing]] [[agrarianism|agrarian]] party \u2014 and [[Heimwehr|Heimatblock]], the parliamentary wing of the ''[[Heimwehr]]'', a [[paramilitary]] [[ultra-nationalist]] group. The coalition assumed the pressing task of tackling the problems of the [[Great Depression]]. Much of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]'s industry had been situated in the areas that became part of [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Yugoslavia]] after [[World War I]] as a result of the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain]]. Postwar Austria was therefore economically disadvantaged.\n\nDollfuss' majority in [[Federal Assembly of Austria|Parliament]] was marginal; his government had only a one-vote majority.<ref>{{Cite book|title=\u00d6sterreich I (Die untersch\u00e4tzte Republik) |last=Portisch |first=Hugo| author2=Sepp Riff |year=1989 |publisher=Verlag Kremayr und Scheriau |location=Vienna, Austria |isbn=3-218-00485-3 |page=415}}</ref>\n\n== Dollfuss as dictator of Austria ==\n\n[[File:DollfussEnGinebra1933.jpeg|thumb|Chancellor Dollfuss in [[Geneva]], 1933]]\n{{main|Self-elimination of the Austrian Parliament}}\nIn March 1933, an argument arose over irregularities in the voting procedure. The Social Democratic president of the [[National Council of Austria|National Council]] (the lower house of parliament) [[Karl Renner]] resigned to be able to cast a vote as a parliament member. As a consequence, the two vice presidents, belonging to other parties, resigned as well to be able to vote. Without a president, the parliament could not conclude the session. Dollfuss took the three resignations as a pretext to declare that the National Council had become unworkable, and advised [[President of Austria|President]] [[Wilhelm Miklas]] to issue a decree adjourning it indefinitely. When the National Council wanted to reconvene days after the resignation of the three presidents, Dollfuss had police bar entrance to parliament, effectively eliminating democracy in Austria. From that point onwards, he governed as dictator by emergency decree with absolute power.\n\nDollfuss was concerned that with [[NSDAP|German National Socialist]] leader [[Adolf Hitler]] becoming Chancellor of Germany in 1933, the [[Austrian National Socialism|Austrian National Socialists]] (DNSAP) could gain a significant minority in future elections (according to fascism scholar [[Stanley G. Payne]], should elections have been held in 1933, the DNSAP could have mustered about 25% of the votes \u2013 contemporary [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] analysts suggest a higher support of 50%, with a 75% approval rate in the [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] region bordering Nazi Germany).<ref>Stanley G. Payne, ''A History of Fascism 1914-1945''</ref><ref name=\"Eve\"/> In addition, the Soviet Union's influence in Europe had increased throughout the 1920s and early 1930s. Dollfuss banned the communists on 26 May 1933 and the DNSAP on 19 June 1933. Under the banner of [[Christian Social Party (Austria)|Christian Social Party]], he later established a one-party dictatorship rule largely modeled after fascism in Italy, banning all other Austrian parties including the Social Democratic Labour Party (SDAP\u00d6). Social Democrats however continued to exist as an independent organization, nevertheless, without its paramilitary ''[[Republikanischer Schutzbund]]'', which until 31 March 1933<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.doew.braintrust.at/m9sm101.html|title=D\u00f6W - Documentation Center of Austrian Resistance|work=braintrust.at|accessdate=5 July 2015}}</ref> could have mustered tens of thousands against Dollfuss' government.\n\n=== Austrofascism ===\n\nDollfuss modelled [[Austrofascism]] according to [[Catholic]] [[corporatist]] ideals with [[clericalism|anti-secularist]] tones and in a similar way to Italian [[fascism]], dropping Austrian pretenses of unification with Germany as long as the Nazi Party remained in power. In August 1933, [[Benito Mussolini]]'s regime issued a guarantee of Austrian independence. Dollfuss also exchanged 'Secret Letters' with Mussolini about ways to guarantee Austrian independence. Mussolini was interested in Austria forming a buffer zone against Nazi Germany. Dollfuss always stressed the similarity of the regimes of Hitler in Germany and [[Joseph Stalin]] in the Soviet Union, and was convinced that Austrofascism and Italian fascism could counter [[totalitarian]] national socialism and communism in Europe.\n\nIn September 1933 Dollfuss merged his Christian Social Party with elements of other nationalist and conservative groups, including the Heimwehr, which encompassed many workers who were unhappy with the radical leadership of the socialist party, to form the ''[[Fatherland Front (Austria)|Vaterl\u00e4ndische Front]]'', though the Heimwehr continued to exist as an independent organization until 1936, when Dollfuss' successor [[Kurt von Schuschnigg]] forcibly merged it into the Front, instead creating the unabidingly loyal ''Frontmiliz'' as paramilitary task force. Dollfuss escaped an assassination attempt in October 1933 by [[Rudolf Dertill]], a 22-year-old who had been ejected from the military for his national socialist views.\n\n=== Austrian civil war ===\n\nIn February 1934 the security forces provoked arrests of Social Democrats and unjustified{{clarify|date=November 2019}} searches for weapons of the Social Democrats' already outlawed [[Republikanischer Schutzbund]]. After the Dollfuss dictatorship took steps against known Social Democrats, the Social Democrats called for nationwide resistance against the government. [[Austrian Civil War|A civil war]] began, which lasted sixteen days, from 12 until 27 February. Fierce fighting took place primarily in the East of Austria, especially in the streets of some outer [[Vienna]] districts, where large fortress-like [[Gemeindebau|municipal workers' buildings]] were situated, and in the northern, industrial areas of the province of [[Styria]], where Nazi agents{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} had great interest in a bloodbath between security forces and workers' militias. The resistance was suppressed by police and military power. The Social Democrats were outlawed,<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IaaJAAAAMAAJ&q=Sozialdemokratische+Partei+verboten+1934 |title=Protokolle des Ministerrates der Ersten Republik, Volume 8, Part 6 |isbn=3-7046-0004-0 |page=xvii |year=1985 |language=de |accessdate=2018-03-04|last1=Ministerrat |first1=Austria |last2=Neck |first2=Rudolf |last3=Wandruszka |first3=Adam |last4=Ackerl |first4=Isabella }}</ref> and their leaders were imprisoned or fled abroad.\n\n=== New constitution ===\n\nDollfuss staged a parliamentary session with just his party members present in April 1934 to [[May Constitution of 1934|have his new constitution approved]], effectively the second constitution in the world espousing [[corporatist]] ideas after that of the Portuguese ''[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]''.<ref>Stanley G.

Mussolini, known as \"Il Duce\", personally gave the announcement to Dollfuss's widow, who was a guest at his villa in [[Riccione]] with her children. He also put at the disposal of [[Ernst R\u00fcdiger Starhemberg]], who spent a holiday in [[Venice]], a plane that allowed the prince to rush back to Vienna and to face the assailants with his militia, with the permission of President [[Wilhelm Miklas]].<ref>Richard Lamb, ''Mussolini and the British'', 1997, p. 149</ref>\n\nMussolini also mobilised a part of the Italian army on the Austrian border and threatened Hitler with war in the event of a German invasion of Austria to thwart the putsch. Then he announced to the world: \"The independence of Austria, for which he has fallen, is a principle that has been defended and will be defended by Italy even more strenuously\", and then replaced in the main square of [[Bolzano]] the statue<ref>[[:de:Walther-Denkmal (Bozen)]]</ref> of [[Walther von der Vogelweide]], a Germanic troubadour, with that of [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]], a Roman general who conquered part of Germany. This was the greatest moment of friction between Italian Fascism and National Socialism and Mussolini himself came down several times to reaffirm the differences in the field. The assassination of Dollfuss was accompanied by uprisings in many regions in Austria, resulting in further deaths. In [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], a large contingent of northern German Nazis tried to seize power but were subdued by the Italian units nearby. At first Hitler was jubilant, but the Italian reaction surprised him. Hitler became convinced that he could not face a conflict with the Western European powers, and he officially denied liability, stating his regret for the murder of the Austrian Prime Minister. He replaced the ambassador to Vienna with [[Franz von Papen]] and prevented the conspirators entering Germany, also expelling them from the Austrian Nazi Party. The Nazi assassins in Vienna, after declaring the formation of a new government under Austrian Nazi [[Anton Rintelen]], previously exiled by Dollfuss as Austrian Ambassador to Rome, surrendered after threats from the Austrian military of blowing up the Chancellery using [[dynamite]], and were subsequently tried and executed by [[hanging]].<ref name=\"Death\"/> [[Kurt Schuschnigg]], previously Minister of Education, was appointed new chancellor of Austria after a few days, assuming the office from Dollfuss\u2019 deputy Starhemberg.\n\nOut of a population of 6.5 million, approximately 500,000 Austrians were present at Dollfuss\u2019 burial in [[Vienna]].<ref name=\"Death\"/> He is interred in the [[Hietzing]] cemetery in Vienna<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.viennatouristguide.at/Friedhoefe/Hietzing/Ehrengraeber/z_dollfuss.htm |title=Vienna Tourist Guide: Dollfuss Hietzinger Friedhof |publisher=Hedwig Abraham  |accessdate=6 February 2010}} (includes photographs)</ref> beside his wife [[Alwine Dollfu\u00df|Alwine Dollfuss]] (d. 1973) and two of his children, Hannerl and Eva, all of whom were in Italy as guests of [[Rachele Mussolini]] at the time of his death, an event which saw Mussolini himself shed tears over his slain ally.<ref name=\"Eve\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aspetos.at/de/traueranzeige/rudolf_dollfuss |title=Rudolf Dollfu\u00df - Traueranzeige und Parte \u2020 05.11.2011 - ASPETOS |accessdate=January 22, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428114838/http://www.aspetos.at/de/traueranzeige/rudolf_dollfuss |archive-date=2012-04-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== In literature ==\n\nIn [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s 1941 play ''[[The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui]]'', Dollfuss is represented by the character \"Dullfeet\".<ref name=\"The New York Times - 9 May 1991- Review/Theater; Brecht's Cauliflower King In Another Resistible Rise\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/09/theater/review-theater-brecht-s-cauliflower-king-in-another-resistible-rise.html|title=Review/Theater; Brecht's Cauliflower King In Another Resistible Rise|last=[[Mel Gussow]]|date=May 9, 1991|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=24 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Works ==\n\n* ''Das Kammersystem in der Landwirtschaft \u00d6sterreichs''.

The WBF has been involved in creating the modern bodypainting art movement, which has become worldwide, and the event's media coverage has continually increased. Over the years the festival has been hosted in different towns around the state of Carinthia, and in its 20th year it acquired a new home in the capital city, Klagenfurt am W\u00f6rthersee. Interaction with local art initiatives and the cultural institutions of the region has provided the art of bodypainting with opportunities for growth and networking.\n\nThe WBF is held during the summer months usually in July. It attracts artists from 50+ nations and attracts 30,000+ spectators.<ref name=\"Kamera\">H\u00e4nninen, Lauri: ''V\u00e4ri maalaa tarinan''. ''Kamera'' magazine 6-7/2010, pp. 14\u201318.</ref> It consists of a preparatory week followed by 3 main days of the festival/competition. The preparatory week consists of [[workshops]] and side events. \n\nThe workshops offer many educational programs and lessons by leading artists in brush & sponge, [[airbrush]], special effects, beauty make-up, head dressing including colour theory and history. All workshops are run and handled under the WB Academy and are also scheduled throughout the year in various cities worldwide. Side events include parties such as the surreal Costume Ball (Body Circus) with international DJs and musical stage performances. Also included are exhibitions, gatherings, meeting points and industry discussions.\n\nThe three main days are open to the general public in a park also known as \"Bodypaint City\" where the World, Special and Amateur Awards are held.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/in-pictures-44847904|title= World Bodypainting Festival: Models transformed into amazing artworks|work=BBC News|date=16 July 2018}}</ref> The festival is open to both adults and children and is considered a family-friendly environment. Spectators and visitors alike are able to step \"into the surreal\" filled with a unique world of art that excites the [[senses]] and the [[imagination]]. Visitors can also take part and express themselves in various activities throughout Bodypaint City. Artists compete on all three days with a given theme in the categories of brush & sponge, airbrush and special effects for the World Champion Award & title announced on Sunday. Also included is the World [[Facepainting]] Award, Armateur Award, Installation Award, Special Effects Face Make-up, Make-up Battle Award and the Photo Award. All categories have separate prizes and trophies. Artists can use either male or female models. The festival is open for both adults and children, and many families come there together.<ref name=\"Kamera\"/>\n\nThe three main days of the festival also plays host to a [[VIP]] area, a bodypainting manufacture & suppliers' market, fashion & [[crafts]] market, food & beverage vendors, headline stage bands, performers and international DJs throughout various musical zones of Bodypaint City. \"There is something for everyone\" including the closing Paint Party.\n\nThe festival keeps on developing the artform of body painting. The new location in Klagenfurt brings many more opportunity to connect the art of bodypainting with local museum, art galleries and cultural institutions. The city gallery (Stadtgalerie), the Museum of Modern Art Carinthia (MMKK), the literature museum (Musil Museum) theatres and private owned galleries offer space and opportunities for bodypainting artists to exhibit and perform and open their spaces free of charges during the festival week.\n\n==History==\nThe festival was first created and launched in 1998 in [[Seeboden]], [[Austria]] as the European Bodypainting Festival in order to promote summer tourism to the region by then tourism manager Alex Barendregt. It was a small gathering of artists and the first \"[[boutique]] event\" of its kind in the world.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/destinations/europe/austria/world-bodypainting-festival/|magazine=National Geographic|title=At the World Bodypainting Festival, the Human Body Is a Canvas|author=Allison McNearney}}</ref> Also launched in conjunction was the WB Academy, which in 2008 was offered worldwide.

Today it is the biggest annual event in the bodypainting culture, community and industry at large. It has become the \"Center of Bodypainting\" and \"Home\" to many. Combined with Mr. Barendregt's efforts, the WB Association, WB Production and the WB Academy are considered and responsible for providing a worldwide platform and introduction into the Art of Bodypainting. \n\nIn 2017 the festival venue moved a bit further down the lake to [[Klagenfurt]], the capital city of the state of Carinthia. The new venue is the Goethepark, a public park surrounded by the cultural treasures such as the theatre, the art house and many galleries.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:WBF male 1.jpg|Artist at work\nFile:World Bodypainting Festival Asia.jpg|Artist at Work\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.bodypainting-festival.com Official site]\n* [http://gallery.bodypainting-festival.com Photo Galleries from the past World Bodypainting Festivals]\n* [http://www.fotopedia.com/en/World_Bodypainting_Festival World Body Painting Festival 2007 slideshow]\n* [http://www.wb-production.com Organizer of the WBF]\n* [https://www.kleinezeitung.at/kaernten/5461259/Bodypainting-Festival_Klagenfurt-ist-wieder-im-Rausch-der-Farben Klagenfurt ist wieder im Rausch der Farben] \u2013 newspaper article in [[Kleine Zeitung]]\n* [https://finance.yahoo.com/photos/16th-world-bodypainting-festival-1374092936-slideshow/16th-world-bodypainting-festival-photo-1374092841796.html 16th World Bodypainting Festival] \u2013 on the [[Yahoo!

Various projects were envisaged such as a four jet short/medium haul airliner and various iterations of powerplant.\n\nThe main production line was at the [[Kiev-Svyatoshino]] (now \"[[Aviant]]\") aircraft production plant which built 985, with 180 built at [[Ulan-Ude Aviation Plant|Ulan Ude]] and a further 197 An-24T tactical transport/freighters at [[Irkut Corporation|Irkutsk]]. Production in the USSR was shut down by 1978.\n\nProduction continues at China's [[Xi'an Aircraft Industrial Corporation]] which makes licensed, reverse-engineered and redesigned aircraft as the [[Xian Y-7]], and its derivatives. Manufacture of the Y-7, in civil form, has now been supplanted by the [[MA60]] derivative with western engines and avionics, to improve performance and economy, and widen the export appeal.\n\n===Total production===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right; font-size: 96%;\"\n|-\n!Total Production (Not including Chinese Y-7)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://russianplanes.net/planelist/Antonov/An-24|title=\u0410\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u0410\u043d-24|website=russianplanes.net|accessdate=2019-08-22}}</ref>!! 1979 !! 1978 !! 1977 !! 1976 !! 1975 !! 1974 !! 1973 !! 1972 !! 1971 !! 1970 !! 1969 !! 1968 !! 1967 !! 1966 !! 1965 !! 1964 !! 1963 !! 1962 !! 1961 !! 1960 !! 1959 \n|-\n||'''1285'''||1||2||15||25||45||88||83||82||91||135||136||158||166||112||62||44||25||9||1||4||1\n|}\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:Antonow an24 cockpit.jpg|thumb|Cockpit]]\n;An-24\n: Original design and prototypes.

Various projects were envisaged such as a four jet short/medium haul airliner and various iterations of powerplant.\n\nThe main production line was at the [[Kiev-Svyatoshino]] (now \"[[Aviant]]\") aircraft production plant which built 985, with 180 built at [[Ulan-Ude Aviation Plant|Ulan Ude]] and a further 197 An-24T tactical transport/freighters at [[Irkut Corporation|Irkutsk]]. Production in the USSR was shut down by 1978.\n\nProduction continues at China's [[Xi'an Aircraft Industrial Corporation]] which makes licensed, reverse-engineered and redesigned aircraft as the [[Xian Y-7]], and its derivatives. Manufacture of the Y-7, in civil form, has now been supplanted by the [[MA60]] derivative with western engines and avionics, to improve performance and economy, and widen the export appeal.\n\n===Total production===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right; font-size: 96%;\"\n|-\n!Total Production (Not including Chinese Y-7)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://russianplanes.net/planelist/Antonov/An-24|title=\u0410\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u0410\u043d-24|website=russianplanes.net|accessdate=2019-08-22}}</ref>!! 1979 !! 1978 !! 1977 !! 1976 !! 1975 !! 1974 !! 1973 !! 1972 !! 1971 !! 1970 !! 1969 !! 1968 !! 1967 !! 1966 !! 1965 !! 1964 !! 1963 !! 1962 !! 1961 !! 1960 !! 1959 \n|-\n||'''1285'''||1||2||15||25||45||88||83||82||91||135||136||158||166||112||62||44||25||9||1||4||1\n|}\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:Antonow an24 cockpit.jpg|thumb|Cockpit]]\n;An-24\n: Original design and prototypes.
