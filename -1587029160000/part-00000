He lived in [[Stavropol]] and was a married father of two children, although he had known himself to be [[homosexual]] since puberty.<ref>''The Killer Department'' p. 131</ref>\n\nIn 1961, Slivko witnessed a traffic accident in which a drunken motorcyclist had swerved into a group of pedestrians, fatally injuring a boy in his early teens who was wearing a [[Young Pioneer organization of the Soviet Union|Young Pioneers]] uniform.<ref>''Born to Kill in the USSR'' p. 61</ref> For reasons Slivko would later insist he never could explain, this scene had [[sexual arousal|sexually excited]] him. He later recalled the accident vividly: \"The boy had experienced [[convulsion]]s in his death throes as the smell of gasoline and fire permeated the air.\"<ref>''The Killer Department'' p. 131</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1963, Slivko exploited his position at a children's club he ran to relive the fantasies of this accident.<ref>''Born to Kill in the USSR'' p. 65</ref> Once or twice a year, he would form a close friendship with a boy who was usually aged between 12 and 15 and never older than 17.{{refn|group=n|Following his arrest, Slivko stated to investigators he never selected a youth older than 17 both because the boy killed in the 1961 traffic accident which had sparked his fantasies had been in his early teens, and out of concerns regarding the victim's physical strength.<ref>''The Killer Department'' p. 133</ref>}} The boy would be short for his age and would be wearing a Young Pioneers uniform - just like the boy Slivko had seen die in the traffic accident. Slivko would gain the boy's confidence and tell him of an experiment he knew which involved a controlled [[hanging]] to stretch the [[Vertebral column|spine]], and that he would reenact the scene of a [[Soviet partisans|partisan]] executed by Nazi soldiers for his children's club in order to film this scene,<ref>''Hunting The Devil'' p. 160</ref> after which, the boy was assured, Slivko would revive him from his state of [[unconsciousness]].<ref>''The Killer Department'' p. 132</ref>\n\nPrior to each boy undertaking this \"experiment\", Slivko would purchase a new uniform for the victim to wear and shine his shoes. In addition, to prevent any vomiting, the victim was required not to eat for several hours before the experiment.<ref>''Born to Kill in the USSR'' [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qX0gAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA325&dq=Born+to+Kill+in+the+USSR&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CBwQ6AEwAGoVChMIwq-XvcDtyAIVgi4aCh1mFA6o#v=onepage&q=slivko&f=false p. 67]</ref> Once the boy was unconscious, Slivko would strip him naked, caress and fondle him, take films in which he would arrange the body in suggestive positions, and repeatedly [[masturbate]].<ref>''Hunting The Devil'' p. 164</ref>\n\n== Murders ==\nOver the course of 22 years, Slivko persuaded 43 boys to take part in this contrived experiment. In 36 cases, following his established ritual of [[photography]], filming, and repeated masturbation, Slivko revived these boys. Cautioned by Slivko into silence, these individuals resumed their lives unaware of what had happened to them whilst they had been unconscious.<ref>''The Killer Department'' p. 162</ref> However, in seven cases, Slivko's behavior became violent: once these victims were unconscious, he [[dismembered]] their bodies, poured [[gasoline]] on their limbs and torso, and set the remains on fire to remind himself of the traffic accident which had sparked his arousal. Slivko typically retained the victim's shoes as a [[Souvenir|memento]], as well as the photographs and films which he developed in a home laboratory.<ref>''The Killer Department'' p. 132</ref> The pictures and films served as stimuli for Slivko's masturbatory fantasies for months or years until he needed fresher stimuli and killed again.<ref>''Hunting the Devil'' p. 164</ref>\n\nOn June 2, 1964, Slivko killed his first victim, a 15-year-old runaway boy named Nikolai Dobryshev.<ref>''Born to Kill in the USSR'' p. 65</ref> Slivko claimed this particular victim was killed unintentionally, as he had been unable to revive Dobryshev once he was unconscious. He dismembered the boy's body and [[Burial|buried]] him, also destroying the film and photographs he had taken of this particular victim. In May 1965, Slivko killed his second victim, Aleksei Kovalenko. Slivko began operating a tourist club for boys named Chergid in 1966, after his first club had been destroyed in a fire.\n\nEight years later, on November 14, 1973, a 15-year-old boy named Aleksander Nesmeyanov disappeared in [[Nevinnomyssk]], [[Stavropol Krai]]. Two years later, on May 11, 1975, an 11-year-old boy named Andrei Pogasyan disappeared. Pogasyan's mother told the police that a man had shot a film in a nearby forest and that her son was going to participate. However, the police did nothing to prevent this because they knew Slivko, who had won awards for other, more innocuous films. In 1980, a 13-year-old boy named Sergei Fatsiyev, who along with Nesmeyanov and Pogasyan was a member of Chergid, disappeared. The next victim was a fifteen-year-old named Vyacheslav Khovistik, who was killed in 1982. On July 23, 1985, Slivko killed his final victim, a 13-year-old boy named Sergei Pavlov, who disappeared after telling a neighbor he was going to meet the leader of Chergid.\n\n== Arrest ==\nIn November 1985, [[prosecutor]] Tamara Languyeva investigated Pavlov's disappearance and took an interest in Chergid's activities. However, she had no evidence of anything illegal in the way the club was run. Languyeva questioned many boys who had belonged to the club, who said they had suffered \"temporary [[amnesia]]\" and that Slivko had performed many experiments with them.<ref>http://www.1tv.ru/sprojects_edition/si5937/fi26843</ref> Following a long inquiry, Slivko was arrested at his [[Stavropol]] home in December 1985. He would later be formally accused of seven murders, seven counts of [[sexual abuse]], and seven counts of [[necrophilia]]. In early 1986, he led investigators to the bodies of six of his victims, although he was unable to locate the body of his first victim, Nikolai Dobryshev.

He lived in [[Stavropol]] and was a married father of two children, although he had known himself to be [[homosexual]] since puberty.<ref>''The Killer Department'' p. 131</ref>\n\nIn 1961, Slivko witnessed a traffic accident in which a drunken motorcyclist had swerved into a group of pedestrians, fatally injuring a boy in his early teens who was wearing a [[Young Pioneer organization of the Soviet Union|Young Pioneers]] uniform.<ref>''Born to Kill in the USSR'' p. 61</ref> For reasons Slivko would later insist he never could explain, this scene had [[sexual arousal|sexually excited]] him. He later recalled the accident vividly: \"The boy had experienced [[convulsion]]s in his death throes as the smell of gasoline and fire permeated the air.\"<ref>''The Killer Department'' p. 131</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1963, Slivko exploited his position at a children's club he ran to relive the fantasies of this accident.<ref>''Born to Kill in the USSR'' p. 65</ref> Once or twice a year, he would form a close friendship with a boy who was usually aged between 12 and 15 and never older than 17.{{refn|group=n|Following his arrest, Slivko stated to investigators he never selected a youth older than 17 both because the boy killed in the 1961 traffic accident which had sparked his fantasies had been in his early teens, and out of concerns regarding the victim's physical strength.<ref>''The Killer Department'' p. 133</ref>}} The boy would be short for his age and would be wearing a Young Pioneers uniform - just like the boy Slivko had seen die in the traffic accident. Slivko would gain the boy's confidence and tell him of an experiment he knew which involved a controlled [[hanging]] to stretch the [[Vertebral column|spine]], and that he would reenact the scene of a [[Soviet partisans|partisan]] executed by Nazi soldiers for his children's club in order to film this scene,<ref>''Hunting The Devil'' p. 160</ref> after which, the boy was assured, Slivko would revive him from his state of [[unconsciousness]].<ref>''The Killer Department'' p. 132</ref>\n\nPrior to each boy undertaking this \"experiment\", Slivko would purchase a new uniform for the victim to wear and shine his shoes. In addition, to prevent any vomiting, the victim was required not to eat for several hours before the experiment.<ref>''Born to Kill in the USSR'' [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qX0gAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA325&dq=Born+to+Kill+in+the+USSR&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CBwQ6AEwAGoVChMIwq-XvcDtyAIVgi4aCh1mFA6o#v=onepage&q=slivko&f=false p. 67]</ref> Once the boy was unconscious, Slivko would strip him naked, caress and fondle him, take films in which he would arrange the body in suggestive positions, and repeatedly [[masturbate]].<ref>''Hunting The Devil'' p. 164</ref>\n\n== Murders ==\nOver the course of 22 years, Slivko persuaded 43 boys to take part in this contrived experiment. In 36 cases, following his established ritual of [[photography]], filming, and repeated masturbation, Slivko revived these boys. Cautioned by Slivko into silence, these individuals resumed their lives unaware of what had happened to them whilst they had been unconscious.<ref>''The Killer Department'' p. 162</ref> However, in seven cases, Slivko's behavior became violent: once these victims were unconscious, he [[dismembered]] their bodies, poured [[gasoline]] on their limbs and torso, and set the remains on fire to remind himself of the traffic accident which had sparked his arousal. Slivko typically retained the victim's shoes as a [[Souvenir|memento]], as well as the photographs and films which he developed in a home laboratory.<ref>''The Killer Department'' p. 132</ref> The pictures and films served as stimuli for Slivko's masturbatory fantasies for months or years until he needed fresher stimuli and killed again.<ref>''Hunting the Devil'' p. 164</ref>\n\nOn June 2, 1964, Slivko killed his first victim, a 15-year-old runaway boy named Nikolai Dobryshev.<ref>''Born to Kill in the USSR'' p. 65</ref> Slivko claimed this particular victim was killed unintentionally, as he had been unable to revive Dobryshev once he was unconscious. He dismembered the boy's body and [[Burial|buried]] him, also destroying the film and photographs he had taken of this particular victim. In May 1965, Slivko killed his second victim, Aleksei Kovalenko. Slivko began operating a tourist club for boys named ''Chergid'' in 1966, after his first club had been destroyed in a fire.\n\nEight years later, on November 14, 1973, a 15-year-old boy named Aleksander Nesmeyanov disappeared in [[Nevinnomyssk]], [[Stavropol Krai]]. Two years later, on May 11, 1975, an 11-year-old boy named Andrei Pogasyan disappeared. Pogasyan's mother told the police that a man had shot a film in a nearby forest and that her son was going to participate. However, the police did nothing to prevent this because they knew Slivko, who had won awards for other, more innocuous films. In 1980, a 13-year-old boy named Sergei Fatsiyev, who along with Nesmeyanov and Pogasyan was a member of Chergid, disappeared. The next victim was a fifteen-year-old named Vyacheslav Khovistik, who was killed in 1982. On July 23, 1985, Slivko killed his final victim, a 13-year-old boy named Sergei Pavlov, who disappeared after telling a neighbor he was going to meet the leader of Chergid.\n\n== Arrest ==\nIn November 1985, [[prosecutor]] Tamara Languyeva investigated Pavlov's disappearance and took an interest in Chergid's activities. However, she had no evidence of anything illegal in the way the club was run. Languyeva questioned many boys who had belonged to the club, who said they had suffered \"temporary [[amnesia]]\" and that Slivko had performed many experiments with them.<ref>http://www.1tv.ru/sprojects_edition/si5937/fi26843</ref> Following a long inquiry, Slivko was arrested at his [[Stavropol]] home in December 1985. He would later be formally accused of seven murders, seven counts of [[sexual abuse]], and seven counts of [[necrophilia]]. In early 1986, he led investigators to the bodies of six of his victims, although he was unable to locate the body of his first victim, Nikolai Dobryshev.

Her family later moved to Kansas, then Missouri, before settling in [[Canton, Ohio]]. She initially studied to become a professional musician, but her father noticed her talent for modeling. He showed some interest in her development, but never offered Eberle much financial backing during her lifetime.\n\nEberle's mother offered piano lessons and encouraged her to pursue her musical talent, which she displayed at a young age. Eberle pursued cello professionally, until one day her father was so impressed with a clay mask Eberle worked out that he acquired some modeling wax for her from a patient who made busts. Confident that she would quickly achieve talent in sculpture, Eberle stated, \"I knew it [sculpture] was my work.\"<ref name=\":1\">{{cite book|title=American Women Sculptors|last=Rubinstein|first=Charlotte|publisher=G.K.

This was the only type of sculpture available in Canton for her to study at that time. After a while, Eberle became so desperate to receive some art training that she took it upon herself to get other locals registered to fill spots when she learned that sculptor Frank Vogan would come to Canton, Ohio to teach a class. Eberle continued to study with Vogan for two years, which she said was very useful to her developments as an artist. In 1899, twenty-one-year-old Eberle would begin training under [[George Grey Barnard]] at the Art Students League in New York.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\nAt some point in Eberle's early twenties, she went to visit her family in Puerto Rico, where her father had been relocated as a U.S. Army doctor. While in Puerto Rico, Eberle made small, quick clay sketches of everyday street subjects. Eberle's piece ''Puerto Rican Mother and Child'' (1901) was the first in which she expressed the everyday life of lower-class people.<ref name=\":1\"/> She received recognition as a young talent right away and received her tuition in scholarships and prizes. Eberle made such an impression on Barnard that eventually he left her in charge of the classroom when he could not make it to lead the class. She achieved early success with her sculpture ''Men and Bull'', created in collaboration with [[Anna Hyatt Huntington]], which was shown at the 1904 exhibition of the [[Society of American Artists]]. In 1906 Huntington and Eberle went their separate ways.\n\nHuntington dedicated her work to animal sculptures and large monuments. Eberle, by contrast, worked on small bronzes dealing with social reform of lower-class immigrants. In 1907 Eberle completed ''Roller Skater'' (1906), also known as ''(Girl with Roller Skate or Roller Skating)'', an energetic clay sketch of a lower class, young girl roller skating down the street. This was the first time she completed a study from the street life of New York.<ref name=\":1\"/> In 1906 she was elected to the [[National Sculpture Society]].<ref name=\"cast\">Susan Casteras, \"Abastenia St. Leger Eberle's White Slave\", ''Woman's Art Journal'' (Spring/Summer 1986) pp. 32\u201336.</ref> In 1920, she was elected to the [[National Academy of Design]] as an Associate Academician. St. Leger Eberle worked in a style related to [[Art Nouveau]] and the [[New Sculpture]] movement. She produced mainly portrait sculpture and decorative work for [[fountain]]s.\n\n==Later career==\n[[File:Abastenia St. Leger Eberle, 1912-13, The White Slave.jpg|thumb|220px|''The White Slave'', 1912\u201313]]\n[[File:Her Only Brother by Abastenia St. Leger Eberle 1921.png|thumb|''Her Only Brother'', 1921]]\nIn May of 1907, Eberle went to Naples, Italy, to oversee the casting process of her bronzes. Initially the foundry workmen were spiteful and jealous towards Eberle, finding it difficult to believe she had done them. Eventually they came around when they noticed Eberle's eye for detail and began taking her orders. When locals would look in the studio where Eberle's bronzes were being cast, locals would exclaim \"Dio Mio\" (meaning \"my goodness\") at a woman doing men's work. Eberle loved Neapolitan people and had good interest in the workmen and their families. When realizing that her men were sustaining themselves off only a hunk of bread all day, Eberle made sure they all had a substantial breakfast.''<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\nHer ''The White Slave'' was exhibited at the 1913 [[Armory Show]] in New York, and caused \"a storm of violent controversy\" because of its shocking combination of contemporary realism and the nude. The sculpture represented [[child prostitution]], which at the time was euphemistically called [[sexual slavery|white slavery]].<ref name= \"cast\"/> When Eberle returned from Italy, she said that she immersed herself \"in the classic arts and was filled with the past.\"<ref name=\":0\"/> This was a pivotal point for Eberle coming in to her own as an artist.\n\nUpon returning to New York, Eberle says, \"When I landed in New York I began again to sense the modern spirit and to live in the present workaday world with all its commonplaces and yet with its idealism\u2026I smelt the city's pungent odors and saw its children playing.\"<ref name=\":0\"/> That summer Eberle spent time as a settlement worker on the Lower East Side in order to \"study the people there and the conditions under which they live, to be near them and to learn from them.\" She often used children in action on the playground as subjects in works like ''Bubbles'' (1908), a study of a young girl blowing soap bubbles.<ref name=\":1\"/> Soon Eberle moved her studio to Greenwich Village. At the time it was known for its immigrants of all backgrounds, low rent, and acceptance of a free lifestyle. Here Eberle created some of her most striking works.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\nFollowing this success she created a number of sculptures depicting working-class children from the [[Lower East Side]], at play and work. These represented \"the vitality of the city's immigrant population\". Eberle explored similar themes of young immigrant children playing in other works such as ''Dance of the Ghetto Children'' (1914). Some of her works called for more political action, such as ''Ragpicker'' (1911) and ''Old Woman Picking Up Coal'' (1906). The latter depicts a poor Italian woman rummaging the streets for bits of coal to heat her stove.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\nLater in Eberle's career, she set up her studio right in New York's Lower East Side, after fearing her work was losing its proletarian character. She found a new place to work on the top floor of a tenement, and set up her studio with a playroom. Eberle used stories and toys to bring children to her studio, where she would work directly from them for her sculpture. In 1911 there was suffrage parade contingent of women sculptors, which Eberle took part in. Eberle's investment in the suffrage movement never ceased, though it took courage in the early 1900s. She was deeply influenced by the writings of [[Jane Addams]], and she was also very committed to the feminist movement.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nFrom 1907 until 1913, Eberle showed at Macbeth Gallery in Manhattan. Her work often did not pull in the money from collectors, and she sold bronze tobacco jars and bookends to get by.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nEberle was given an invitation to exhibit her work at the 1913 Armory Show, and she submitted ''Girls Wading'' (1913), a study of three girls at Coney Island Beach, and another sculpture titled ''White Slave'' (1913), which depicted a nude adolescent girl with arms pinned back being auctioned into prostitution. This work, in particular, generated a great deal of controversy when it was also printed on the cover of a magazine called ''Survey'' (a magazine devoted to social reform). Many readers felt that the cover was unfit to be seen in a decent home.<ref name=\":0\"/> The work ''White Slave'' is Eberle's response to newspaper stories describing the fate of low-income immigrant women forced into prostitution to survive. The woman in ''White Slave'', with a thin and cold demeanor, is much different than the erotic nature of many other 19th figurative works.<ref name=\":0\"/> The work in all ways reveals Eberle's growing social awareness and fearlessness to create the work that was important to her.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\nBy 1930 she had to leave New York because of financial and health problems. She settled in [[Westport, Connecticut]].<ref name=\"cast\"/>\n\nEberle submitted works to the mixed sculpturing category of the [[art competitions at the 1928 Summer Olympics|art competitions at the 1928]] and [[art competitions at the 1932 Summer Olympics|1932 Summer Olympics]], but did not win a medal.<ref name=\"SportsReference\"/> Several of her sculptures are on display at the Kendall Young Library, in Webster City, Iowa, where she was born.\n\nEberle believed that art should have a social function, writing that artists \"had no right to work as an individualist with no responsibility to others.

Her family later moved to Kansas, then Missouri, before settling in [[Canton, Ohio]]. She initially studied to become a professional musician, but her father noticed her talent for modeling. He showed some interest in her development, but never offered Eberle much financial backing during her lifetime.\n\nEberle's mother offered piano lessons and encouraged her to pursue her musical talent, which she displayed at a young age. Eberle pursued cello professionally, until one day her father was so impressed with a clay mask Eberle worked out that he acquired some modeling wax for her from a patient who made busts. Confident that she would quickly achieve talent in sculpture, Eberle stated, \"I knew it [sculpture] was my work.\"<ref name=\":1\">{{cite book|title=American Women Sculptors|last=Rubinstein|first=Charlotte|publisher=G.K.

This was the only type of sculpture available in Canton for her to study at that time. After a while, Eberle became so desperate to receive some art training that she took it upon herself to get other locals registered to fill spots when she learned that sculptor Frank Vogan would come to Canton, Ohio to teach a class. Eberle continued to study with Vogan for two years, which she said was very useful to her developments as an artist. In 1899, twenty-one-year-old Eberle would begin training under [[George Grey Barnard]] at the Art Students League in New York.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\nAt some point in Eberle's early twenties, she went to visit her family in Puerto Rico, where her father had been relocated as a U.S. Army doctor. While in Puerto Rico, Eberle made small, quick clay sketches of everyday street subjects. Eberle's piece ''Puerto Rican Mother and Child'' (1901) was the first in which she expressed the everyday life of lower-class people.<ref name=\":1\"/> She received recognition as a young talent right away and received her tuition in scholarships and prizes. Eberle made such an impression on Barnard that eventually he left her in charge of the classroom when he could not make it to lead the class. She achieved early success with her sculpture ''Men and Bull'', created in collaboration with [[Anna Hyatt Huntington]], which was shown at the 1904 exhibition of the [[Society of American Artists]]. In 1906 Huntington and Eberle went their separate ways.\n\nHuntington dedicated her work to animal sculptures and large monuments. Eberle, by contrast, worked on small bronzes dealing with social reform of lower-class immigrants. In 1907 Eberle completed ''Roller Skater'' (1906), also known as ''(Girl with Roller Skate or Roller Skating)'', an energetic clay sketch of a lower class, young girl roller skating down the street. This was the first time she completed a study from the street life of New York.<ref name=\":1\"/> In 1906 she was elected to the [[National Sculpture Society]].<ref name=\"cast\">Susan Casteras, \"Abastenia St. Leger Eberle's White Slave\", ''Woman's Art Journal'' (Spring/Summer 1986) pp. 32\u201336.</ref> In 1920, she was elected to the [[National Academy of Design]] as an Associate Academician. St. Leger Eberle worked in a style related to [[Art Nouveau]] and the [[New Sculpture]] movement. She produced mainly portrait sculpture and decorative work for [[fountain]]s.\n\n==Later career==\n[[File:Abastenia St. Leger Eberle, 1912-13, The White Slave.jpg|thumb|220px|''The White Slave'', 1912\u201313]]\n[[File:Her Only Brother by Abastenia St. Leger Eberle 1921.png|thumb|''Her Only Brother'', 1921]]\n\"In May of 1907, Eberle went to Naples, Italy, to oversee the casting process of her bronzes. Initially the foundry workmen were spiteful and jealous towards Eberle, finding it difficult to believe she had done them. Eventually they came around when they noticed Eberle's eye for detail and began taking her orders. When locals would look in the studio where Eberle's bronzes were being cast, locals would exclaim \"Dio Mio\" (meaning \"my goodness\") at a woman doing men's work) Eberle loved Neapolitan people and had good interest in the workmen and their families. When realizing that her men were sustaining themselves off only a hunk of bread all day, Eberle made sure they all had a substantial breakfast.''<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\nHer ''The White Slave'' was exhibited at the 1913 [[Armory Show]] in New York, and caused \"a storm of violent controversy\" because of its shocking combination of contemporary realism and the nude. The sculpture represented [[child prostitution]], which at the time was euphemistically called [[sexual slavery|white slavery]].<ref name= \"cast\"/> When Eberle returned from Italy, she said that she immersed herself \"in the classic arts and was filled with the past.\"<ref name=\":0\"/> This was a pivotal point for Eberle coming in to her own as an artist.\n\nUpon returning to New York, Eberle says, \"When I landed in New York I began again to sense the modern spirit and to live in the present workaday world with all its commonplaces and yet with its idealism\u2026I smelt the city's pungent odors and saw its children playing.\"<ref name=\":0\"/> That summer Eberle spent time as a settlement worker on the Lower East Side in order to \"study the people there and the conditions under which they live, to be near them and to learn from them.\" She often used children in action on the playground as subjects in works like ''Bubbles'' (1908), a study of a young girl blowing soap bubbles.<ref name=\":1\"/> Soon Eberle moved her studio to Greenwich Village. At the time it was known for its immigrants of all backgrounds, low rent, and acceptance of a free lifestyle. Here Eberle created some of her most striking works.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\nFollowing this success she created a number of sculptures depicting working-class children from the [[Lower East Side]], at play and work. These represented \"the vitality of the city's immigrant population\". Eberle explored similar themes of young immigrant children playing in other works such as ''Dance of the Ghetto Children'' (1914). Some of her works called for more political action, such as ''Ragpicker'' (1911) and ''Old Woman Picking Up Coal'' (1906). The latter depicts a poor Italian woman rummaging the streets for bits of coal to heat her stove.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\nLater in Eberle's career, she set up her studio right in New York's Lower East Side, after fearing her work was losing its proletarian character. She found a new place to work on the top floor of a tenement, and set up her studio with a playroom. Eberle used stories and toys to bring children to her studio, where she would work directly from them for her sculpture. In 1911 there was suffrage parade contingent of women sculptors, which Eberle took part in. Eberle's investment in the suffrage movement never ceased, though it took courage in the early 1900s. She was deeply influenced by the writings of [[Jane Addams]], and she was also very committed to the feminist movement.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nFrom 1907 until 1913, Eberle showed at Macbeth Gallery in Manhattan. Her work often did not pull in the money from collectors, and she sold bronze tobacco jars and bookends to get by.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nEberle was given an invitation to exhibit her work at the 1913 Armory Show, and she submitted ''Girls Wading'' (1913), a study of three girls at Coney Island Beach, and another sculpture titled ''White Slave'' (1913), which depicted a nude adolescent girl with arms pinned back being auctioned into prostitution. This work, in particular, generated a great deal of controversy when it was also printed on the cover of a magazine called ''Survey'' (a magazine devoted to social reform). Many readers felt that the cover was unfit to be seen in a decent home.<ref name=\":0\"/> The work ''White Slave'' is Eberle's response to newspaper stories describing the fate of low-income immigrant women forced into prostitution to survive. The woman in ''White Slave'', with a thin and cold demeanor, is much different than the erotic nature of many other 19th figurative works.<ref name=\":0\"/> The work in all ways reveals Eberle's growing social awareness and fearlessness to create the work that was important to her.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\nBy 1930 she had to leave New York because of financial and health problems. She settled in [[Westport, Connecticut]].<ref name=\"cast\"/>\n\nEberle submitted works to the mixed sculpturing category of the [[art competitions at the 1928 Summer Olympics|art competitions at the 1928]] and [[art competitions at the 1932 Summer Olympics|1932 Summer Olympics]], but did not win a medal.<ref name=\"SportsReference\"/> Several of her sculptures are on display at the Kendall Young Library, in Webster City, Iowa, where she was born.\n\nEberle believed that art should have a social function, writing that artists \"had no right to work as an individualist with no responsibility to others. [Artists] must see for people\u2014reveal them to themselves and each other.\"<ref name=\"cast\"/> Some of her work is in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. However, she is best known for figurative works that combined realism with emphasis on the flow of drapery and movement.\n\n==Exhibitions==\n\n===\"White Slave\"===\n*Armory Show, ''A Turning Point'', 1913, NYC\n*Knoxville Museum of Art, ''American Women Artists: The 20th Century,'' Oct. 26, 1989\u2013Feb. 4, 1990\n*Queensboro Community College Art Gallery.

While of mainly Irish ancestry, he knew little of the Irish struggle until \"troubles\" began that year in [[Northern Ireland]]. Parker joined the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Solidarity Campaign, led by the [[International Socialists (UK)|International Socialists]] (now known as the [[Socialist Workers Party (Britain)|Socialist Workers Party]]), and immersed himself in literature on the Irish struggle. He continued his involvement with the International Socialists into the early '70s, attending branch meetings in West London, with his old Napier friend, [[Death of Blair Peach|Blair Peach]]. Peach was later killed while participating in a 1979 anti-[[National Front (United Kingdom)|National Front]] rally.\n\n=== Career ===\nParker worked as a writer for much of his life and was prominent in his union, the NZ Writer's Guild. His plays included ''Midnight in Moscow'' (which [[The Press]] reviewer Alan Scott called \"entertaining and thought-provoking\" and \"one of his best to date\"), 2005's Iraq-set Baghdad, Baby, and an adaptation of [[Nicky Hager]]'s expose ''The Hollow Men''. Amongst his screenwork, he won awards in New Zealand for teleplay Share the Dream (starring [[Joel Tobeck]]), and co-writing successful big-screen comedy ''[[Came a Hot Friday]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nzonscreen.com/person/dean-parker/biography|title=Dean Parker &#124; NZ On Screen}}</ref> The 1985 film centered on two conmen in small town New Zealand, and was adapted from the novel by [[Ronald Hugh Morrieson]].\n\nParker's theatrical CV included The Feds, Two Fingers From Frank Zappa, and adaptations of ''[[Great Expectations]]'', and ''[[The Trial]]''.<ref name=\"NBR_38001\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/review-franz-kafka-what-a-trial-38001|title=Review: Franz Kafka \u2013 What a trial|author=Daly-Peoples, John|first=|date=19 November 2008|work=[[National Business Review]]|url-status=live|archive-url=http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/review-franz-kafka-what-a-trial-38001|archive-date=2016-03-03|accessdate=27 September 2011}}</ref> He also wrote many radio plays, among them ''Joe Stalin Knew My Father'' and ''Engels F: A History of the Ould Sod''.\n\nArguably his best-known television work is Welsh-Kiwi rugby tale ''[[Old Scores]]'', which Parker co-wrote with ex All Black triallist and occasional soccer player [[Greg McGee]]. The two also co-created '80s trucking series ''Roche'', whose cast included John Bach and [[Andy Anderson (actor)|Andy Anderson]], and goldmining drama ''[[Gold]]'', a co-production between New Zealand and Canada. Parker also worked on episodes of police drama ''[[Mortimer's Patch]]'', ''Betty's Bunch'', and documentary ''Just Slightly, A People Apart: The Irish in NZ''.\n\nIn 1990 Parker co-directed ''Shattered Dreams'', a documentary on the years leading up to the [[1951 New Zealand waterfront dispute|'51 Waterfront strike]].\n\nBy 1975, Parker was back in New Zealand. Horrified at the election of National Prime Minister, [[Robert Muldoon]], Parker joined the pro-Soviet [[Socialist Unity Party (New Zealand)|Socialist Unity Party]] and soon became chairman of its Auckland City Branch. He was active in the Campaign for an Independent East Timor and played soccer for the [[Halt All Racist Tours]] team for a number of years, though the quality of his play was purportedly variable.\n\nIn July 1977 he penned the first of many articles on Ireland for the SUP's paper, ''Tribune''. By the late '70s the SUP had decided to ally with the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]]. Parker resigned from the SUP in 1978, though he remained a supporter into the late '80s.\n\nIn 1979 Parker travelled to [[Northern Ireland]], visiting West [[Belfast]] and trouble spots like the [[Falls Road (Belfast)|Falls Road]]. Back in NZ, Parker helped form H Block/Armagh in 1980/81 as a support group for republican prisoners in Irish jails. Parker served on the editorial board of the organisation's publication ''Saoirse'' from 1982 until its demise in 2000. Parker contributed regular articles on Irish issues to SUP publications until the party split in 1990.\n\nIn 1991 Parker was a member of the Editorial Group of the socialist journal ''Agenda''. He was also active in the [[Workers' Charter]] Movement, a joint project of Socialist Worker, SPA, [[John Minto]]'s Global Peace and Justice Auckland and [[Matt McCarten]]'s [[Unite Union]].\n\nHe also contributed to the ''[[New Zealand Listener]]'' and ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]''.\n\nParker made no bones about his Marxism\u2013Leninism and injecting his politics into his art.\n\nIn the socialist journal ''Sites'' No 16 Autumn 1988 he wrote;  \"I would describe myself as a class-conscious writer. I'm with Lenin. I'm for the working class seizing control of the wealth it creates, for the replacement of parliament, the army, the police, the judiciary - all those deadly manacles of state control - with workers' committees and militias, and all this done as part of a world-wide struggle..\"\n\n=== Personal Life ===\nParker and his partner Isobel lived in Auckland and had a son.

Known for the screenplay of iconic film ''[[Came a Hot Friday]]'' which he co-wrote with [[Ian Mune]], the television film ''[[Old Scores]]'' and recent play ''Midnight in Moscow'' and was awarded Laureate of the New Zealand [[Arts Foundation of New Zealand|Arts Foundation]] in 2010. \n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early Years ===\nParker was born in [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]], [[Hawke's Bay Region|Hawke's Bay]]. He went to school at Napier Marist and Hasting St John.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/CU2004/S00073/dean-parker-obituary.htm|title=Dean Parker Obituary {{!}} Scoop News|last=|first=|last2=|first2=|date=2020-04-15|website=www.scoop.co.nz|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-15|last3=|first3=}}</ref> \n\nBy 1969 he was living in [[London]], [[England]]. While of mainly Irish ancestry, he knew little of the Irish struggle until \"troubles\" began that year in [[Northern Ireland]]. Parker joined the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Solidarity Campaign, led by the [[International Socialists (UK)|International Socialists]] (now known as the [[Socialist Workers Party (Britain)|Socialist Workers Party]]), and immersed himself in literature on the Irish struggle. He continued his involvement with the International Socialists into the early '70s, attending branch meetings in West London, with his old Napier friend, [[Death of Blair Peach|Blair Peach]]. Peach was later killed while participating in a 1979 anti-[[National Front (United Kingdom)|National Front]] rally.\n\n=== Career ===\nParker worked as a writer for much of his life and was prominent in his union, the NZ Writer's Guild. His plays included ''Midnight in Moscow'' (which [[The Press]] reviewer Alan Scott called \"entertaining and thought-provoking\" and \"one of his best to date\"), 2005's Iraq-set Baghdad, Baby, and an adaptation of [[Nicky Hager]]'s expose ''The Hollow Men''. Amongst his screenwork, he won awards in New Zealand for teleplay Share the Dream (starring [[Joel Tobeck]]), and co-writing successful big-screen comedy ''[[Came a Hot Friday]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nzonscreen.com/person/dean-parker/biography|title=Dean Parker &#124; NZ On Screen}}</ref> The 1985 film centered on two conmen in small town New Zealand, and was adapted from the novel by [[Ronald Hugh Morrieson]].\n\nParker's theatrical CV included The Feds, Two Fingers From Frank Zappa, and adaptations of ''[[Great Expectations]]'', and ''[[The Trial]]''.<ref name=\"NBR_38001\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/review-franz-kafka-what-a-trial-38001|title=Review: Franz Kafka \u2013 What a trial|author=Daly-Peoples, John|first=|date=19 November 2008|work=[[National Business Review]]|url-status=live|archive-url=http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/review-franz-kafka-what-a-trial-38001|archive-date=2016-03-03|accessdate=27 September 2011}}</ref> He also wrote many radio plays, among them ''Joe Stalin Knew My Father'' and ''Engels F: A History of the Ould Sod''.\n\nArguably his best-known television work is Welsh-Kiwi rugby tale ''[[Old Scores]]'', which Parker co-wrote with ex All Black triallist and occasional soccer player [[Greg McGee]]. The two also co-created '80s trucking series ''Roche'', whose cast included John Bach and [[Andy Anderson (actor)|Andy Anderson]], and goldmining drama ''[[Gold]]'', a co-production between New Zealand and Canada. Parker also worked on episodes of police drama ''[[Mortimer's Patch]]'', ''Betty's Bunch'', and documentary ''Just Slightly, A People Apart: The Irish in NZ''.\n\nIn 1990 Parker co-directed ''Shattered Dreams'', a documentary on the years leading up to the [[1951 New Zealand waterfront dispute|'51 Waterfront strike]].\n\nBy 1975, Parker was back in New Zealand. Horrified at the election of National Prime Minister, [[Robert Muldoon]], Parker joined the pro-Soviet [[Socialist Unity Party (New Zealand)|Socialist Unity Party]] and soon became chairman of its Auckland City Branch. He was active in the Campaign for an Independent East Timor and played soccer for the [[Halt All Racist Tours]] team for a number of years, though the quality of his play was purportedly variable.\n\nIn July 1977 he penned the first of many articles on Ireland for the SUP's paper, ''Tribune''. By the late '70s the SUP had decided to ally with the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]]. Parker resigned from the SUP in 1978, though he remained a supporter into the late '80s.\n\nIn 1979 Parker travelled to [[Northern Ireland]], visiting West [[Belfast]] and trouble spots like the [[Falls Road (Belfast)|Falls Road]]. Back in NZ, Parker helped form H Block/Armagh in 1980/81 as a support group for republican prisoners in Irish jails. Parker served on the editorial board of the organisation's publication ''Saoirse'' from 1982 until its demise in 2000. Parker contributed regular articles on Irish issues to SUP publications until the party split in 1990.\n\nIn 1991 Parker was a member of the Editorial Group of the socialist journal ''Agenda''. He was also active in the [[Workers' Charter]] Movement, a joint project of Socialist Worker, SPA, [[John Minto]]'s Global Peace and Justice Auckland and [[Matt McCarten]]'s [[Unite Union]].\n\nHe also contributed to the ''[[New Zealand Listener]]'' and ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]''.\n\nParker made no bones about his Marxism\u2013Leninism and injecting his politics into his art.\n\nIn the socialist journal ''Sites'' No 16 Autumn 1988 he wrote;  \"I would describe myself as a class-conscious writer. I'm with Lenin. I'm for the working class seizing control of the wealth it creates, for the replacement of parliament, the army, the police, the judiciary - all those deadly manacles of state control - with workers' committees and militias, and all this done as part of a world-wide struggle..\"\n\n=== Personal Life ===\nParker and his partner Isobel lived in Auckland and had a son.

Elected as [[Vice president of Liberia|vice-president of Liberia]] in 1881 under [[Anthony William Gardiner]], he succeeded to the presidency after the latter resigned due to poor health. Russell served as [[President of Liberia#List of Presidents of Liberia|tenth President of Liberia]] from 1883 to 1884.\n\nBorn in [[Lexington, Kentucky]], Russell was emancipated in 1833 (with his mother Amelie \"Milly\" Crawford) by their mistress Mary Owen Todd Russell Wickliffe (Russell's grandmother through his white father). Wickliffe also emancipated his cousin, Lucretia Russell, and her four children. Both families emigrated together from the United States to Liberia that year. Alfred F. Russell later married and had a daughter by the name of Julia Ann, who later married John Douglas Simpson one of the first black congressmen from Florida, U.S.A. They both had several children including Alpha Douglas Simpson,father of former Vice President of Liberia Clarence L.Simpson Sr. Alfred Russell served as a Methodist [[missionary]] and later owned a large coffee and sugarcane farm. Russell continued to serve as a Methodist minister after entering politics; he was also elected to the [[Liberian Senate]], and served as [[List of Presidents Pro Tempore of the Senate of Liberia|President Pro Tempore of the Senate of Liberia]].<ref name=\"chronicle\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=saY4ubEU20QC|title=The Annual Messages of the Presidents of Liberia 1848\u20132010: State of the Nation Addresses to the National Legislature|first=D. Elwood|last=Dunn|date=4 May 2011|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|via=Google Books}}</ref>.\n\n==Early life==\nRussell was born into slavery in 1817 [[Lexington, Kentucky]], as the mixed-race, very white son of Amelie \"Milly\" Crawford, a mixed-race woman described as [[octoroon]] (meaning she was 7/8 European in ancestry). Their mistress was Jane Hawkins Todd Irvine. These two slaves were the subject of gossip in Lexington, first bruited by [[Robert S. Todd]]. [[Robert Jefferson Breckinridge|Robert J. Breckinridge]] published a pamphlet revealing the Lexington gossip: that Alfred Francis Russell's father was John Russell, Irvine's grandson and Mary Owen Todd Russell Wickliffe's son from her previous marriage.

Elected as [[Vice president of Liberia|vice-president of Liberia]] in 1881 under [[Anthony William Gardiner]], he succeeded to the presidency after the latter resigned due to poor health. Russell served as [[President of Liberia#List of Presidents of Liberia|tenth President of Liberia]] from 1883 to 1884.\n\nBorn in [[Lexington, Kentucky]], Russell was emancipated in 1833 (with his mother Amelie \"Milly\" Crawford) by their mistress Mary Owen Todd Russell Wickliffe (Russell's grandmother through his white father). Wickliffe also emancipated his cousin, Lucretia Russell, and her four children. Both families emigrated together from the United States to Liberia that year. Alfred F. Russell later got married and had a daughter by the name of Julia Ann, who later got married to John Douglas Simpson one of the first black congress men from Florida, U.S.A. . They both had several children including Alpha Douglas Simpson,father of former Vice President of Liberia Clarence L.Simpson Sr. Alfred Russell served as a Methodist [[missionary]] and later owned a large coffee and sugarcane farm. Russell continued to serve as a Methodist minister after entering politics; he was also elected to the [[Liberian Senate]], and served as [[List of Presidents Pro Tempore of the Senate of Liberia|President Pro Tempore of the Senate of Liberia]].<ref name=\"chronicle\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=saY4ubEU20QC|title=The Annual Messages of the Presidents of Liberia 1848\u20132010: State of the Nation Addresses to the National Legislature|first=D.

The band released their debut album \"Our Home is Gone\" in 2005 (at the time the band was just a two-piece) and later released [[Something Real]] under Doghouse Records, which peaked at #12 on the Billboard Heatseekers Chart. The band found success by promoting their music on [[MySpace]], leading them to become the official MySpace band on the [[Warped Tour 2006]]. \n\nMeg & Dia's profile in the rock scene continued to grow, leading to continued appearances at the Warped Tour, touring with bands such as [[Angels & Airwaves]] and a record deal with [[Warner Bros. Records]]. This deal yielded the pop-rock leaning [[Here, here and here]] , which charted at #103 on the Billboard 200.\n\nIn 2010, Warner Bros. dropped the band, reverting the group back to their indie status. Nonetheless, the band released their fourth studio album, ''[[Cocoon (Meg & Dia album) | Cocoon]]'', which was received positively by fans and critics, but failed to perform well commercially, leading to Dia's manager, Mike Kaminsky, suggesting she audition for ''[[The Voice (U.S.)|The Voice]]''\n\n\n===2011: ''The Voice''===\nDia Frampton was a contestant (and eventual runner-up) on the first season of ''[[The Voice (U.S.)|The Voice]]'' on [[NBC]], introduced as a children's story author.

She cites [[Modest Mouse]], [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[The Avett Brothers]], [[Rocky Votolato]], [[Ben Folds]], [[Etta James]], [[Death Cab for Cutie]], [[The Cranberries]], and [[Cursive]] as influences.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with Dia Frampton|url=http://www.musicgeek.org/wp/2005/06/11/an-interview-with-meg-and-dia|accessdate=January 20, 2008|date=June 11, 2005|publisher=MusicGeek.org}}</ref> During live performances, Frampton plays percussion instruments, such as the [[Cowbell (instrument)|cowbell]] and [[tambourine]], and occasionally a [[Privia|Casio Privia]] keyboard. She almost always performs without shoes on. She also does not like to eat anything within two hours of performing. Her father is an American of English and Dutch ancestry and her mother is Korean, originally from Seoul.\nFrampton often recorded a \"song diary,\" an impromptu recorded song, on her [[MySpace]] page. She explained, \"It was something very raw, and to be honest, something that I was slightly embarrassed to put up because of the quality but I did anyways, for any of our listeners who would care to hear something not hot off the production belt, but something more organic and 'home made.' It made me feel better to share my feelings with people who could connect, and I think that is what happened with many.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/dia-thinks-in-song|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110330043752/http://www.teenvogue.com/industry/blogs/music/2008/10/dia-thinks-in-song.html|url-status=dead|title=Dia Thinks in Song|first=Cond\u00e9|last=Nast|archivedate=March 30, 2011|website=Teen Vogue}}</ref>\n\n=== 2005-2011: Meg & Dia ===\n\n''Main article: [[Meg & Dia]]''\n\nAlong with her sister Meg, Frampton was part of the five-piece alternative rock band Meg & Dia. The band released their debut album \"Our Home is Gone\" in 2005 (at the time the band was just a two-piece) and later released [[Something Real]] under Doghouse Records, which peaked at #12 on the Billboard Heatseekers Chart. The band found success by promoting their music on [[MySpace]], leading them to become the official MySpace band on the [[Warped Tour 2006]]. \n\nMeg & Dia's profile in the rock scene continued to grow, leading to continued appearances at the Warped Tour, touring with bands such as [[Angels & Airwaves]] and a record deal with [[Warner Bros. Records]]. This deal yielded the pop-rock leaning [[Here, here and here]] , which charted at #103 on the Billboard 200.\n\nIn 2010, Warner Bros. dropped the band, reverting the group back to their indie status. Nonetheless, the band released their fourth studio album, ''[[Cocoon (Meg & Dia album) | Cocoon]]'', which was received positively by fans and critics, but failed to perform well commercially, leading to Dia's manager, Mike Kaminsky, suggesting she audition for ''[[The Voice (U.S.)|The Voice]]''\n\n\n===2011: ''The Voice''===\nDia Frampton was a contestant (and eventual runner-up) on the first season of ''[[The Voice (U.S.)|The Voice]]'' on [[NBC]], introduced as a children's story author. Frampton stated that she had originally joined the show only with the intention of promoting ''[[Cocoon (Meg & Dia album)|Cocoon]]'' and had not expected that she would make it that far in the competition.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dia starts The Voice tour|url=http://meganddia.com/?p=73|website=Meganddia.com|accessdate=January 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405193718/http://meganddia.com/?p=73|archive-date=April 5, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> She was selected to be on the team of coach [[Blake Shelton]], who stated, \"when I heard your voice, I started to smile.\" Frampton advanced through the show's quarter-finals and semi-finales after renditions of \"[[Heartless (Kanye West song)|Heartless]]\" and \"[[Losing My Religion]]\". Notably, the aforementioned singles were the highest charting iTunes digital songs by any contestant on ''The Voice'' during its respective voting eligibility period, with \"Inventing Shadows\" topping the charts at No.&nbsp;1. Following the season finale on June 29, 2011, \"Inventing Shadows\" debuted at No.&nbsp;20 on the Billboard Hot 100 with 137,000 downloads sold. As of July 7, 2011 Frampton's ''The Voice'' digital releases have sold 480,000 downloads.<ref>{{cite web|last=Trust|first=Gary |url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/tv-film/american-idol-vs-the-voice-who-won-the-1005268192.story |title='American Idol' Vs.
