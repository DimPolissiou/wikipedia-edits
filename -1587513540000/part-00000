In 942 his son Count Lothair II of Walbeck dedicated a [[house monastery]] at his residence, part of a reparation after he had been involved in a failed assassination attempt instigated by the [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]] duke [[Henry I, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Bavaria]] against his brother King [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]].
