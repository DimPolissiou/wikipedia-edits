{"title_page": "Johannes Matthiae Gothus", "text_new": "{{unreferenced|date=October 2011}}\n[[File:Johannes Matthi\u00e6 Gothus.JPG|150px|thumb|Johannes Matthi\u00e6 Gothus]]\n\n'''Johannes Matthiae Gothus''' (born 29 December 1592 in [[V\u00e4stra Husby]] - died 18 February 1670 in Stockholm) was a Swedish Bishop and a [[Uppsala University]] professor, the rector of the [[Collegium illustrious]] in [[Stockholm]] (1626\u20131629) and the most eminent teacher in Sweden during the seventeenth century. He was Bishop of [[Str\u00e4ngn\u00e4s]] from 1643 to 1664.\n\nJ embodies like no other sv church during the confessional era the continuity and renewal of the Reformed evangelical humanist tradition in Sweden. He had close connections with the Swedish royal house and with European reform circles. In doing so, he exerted influence on the so-called folk teaching (school order 1649) and on church organization issues. In particular, he was the spokesman for a so-called ecumenical, European religious policy. His fate was therefore sealed when, with the guardianship of 1660, the ecclesiastical cycles changed. He was then forced to resign from the bishopric. As an ecumenical student, he takes a special position among Swedes. Only 300 years later with Nathan S\u00f6derblom did he get his equal.\n\n== Family ==\n\nGothus was the son of the vicar Matthias Petri Uppl\u00e4nning (1533-1610) and Anna Danielsdotter Grubbe, the daughter of Daniel Jonsson Grubbe, the mayor of Norrk\u00f6ping. Matthias Petri Uppl\u00e4nning's ancestors had been part of the old Upplandian nobility. One source claims that \"Bishop Johannes Matthiae's grandfather's mother was Birgitta Vasa, a cousin of king [[Gustav Vasa]]. Gothus had 14 siblings, one of whom was the merchant in S\u00f6derk\u00f6ping Peder Mattsson [[Stiernfelt]].\n\n[[File:Epitaphium.jpg|thumb|]]\n\nGothus first marriage was to Catarina Nilsdotter Bohm, the daughter of chamberlain of [[Kammarkollegiet]], The Legal, Financial and Administrative Services Agency, Nils Olofsson Bohm and Karin Pedersdotter. The marriage itself took place at the [[Royal Palace in Stockholm]] in the autumn of 1634. His second marriage was to Beata Nilsdotter Lillieram, daughter of chancellor [[Nils Chesnecopherus Lillieram]], which possibly took place at [[Rockelstad]] Castle in 1659.\n\nThe descendants of Johannes Matthiae Gothus were introduced at the ''Riddarhuset'', [[Swedish House of Nobility]] in Stockholm, under the name Oljeqvist as noble family number 331.\n\nChildren:\n\n#  Christina Johansdotter\n# Johan Johansson Oljeqvist\n# Gustav Johansson Oljeqvist\n# Anna Johansdotter Oljeqvist\n# Nils Johansson Oljeqvist\n# Karin Johansdotter Oljeqvist\n# Kristina Johansdotter Oljeqvist\n# Elisabeth Johansdotter Oljeqvist\n# Maria Johansdotter Oljeqvist\n# Petrus Johansdotter Oljeqvist\n# Carl Johansson Oljeqvist \n# Maria Johansdotter\n# Katarina Johansdotter Oljeqvist\n\n== Career ==\n=== Early Life and Education ===\nGothus' special position among the clergy is explained by his unique life course. He grew up in a milieu that was shaped by Duke Charles's struggle against [[Sigismund]], the high nobility, the priesthood and the practical-religious problem associated with immigration of foreign labor in the mountain management. His father, who was a church pastor near S\u00f6derk\u00f6ping, had, as one of the priesthood delegates, signed the S\u00f6derk\u00f6ping Heritage Society in 1590, his 20-year-old brother was a pastor of Duke Karl in 1597, and since 1599 the church pastor in Norrk\u00f6ping, where the Confederate Confederate's through a wide-eyed congregational care assimilated the reformed population. Like Duke Charles, later [[Charles IX of Sweden]], Gothus' came to work for an evangelical-humanist church reform and to meet the opposition of the clergy.\n\nDuring a ten-year study period, beginning in 1599 in Link\u00f6ping, Gothus experienced [[Link\u00f6ping Bloodbath]] and Norrk\u00f6ping's heritage association. Once the stormy decade of 1590s had come to an end, he enrolled at Uppsala university. Upon enrolling, he immediately joined the pious religious controversy of the compatriot, the educated [[Johannes Messenius]] of Braunsberg's Jesuit College, who was only then in conflict with the intrusive scholastic confessional representative [[Johannes Rudbeckius]]. During his study stay in Uppsala, he received further impulses for an independent spiritual orientation. He enjoyed financial support from the East Gothic court circles and the bourgeoisie, from Duke Johan and his wife, king Gustav II Adolf's sister and High Councillor [[Johan Skytte]]. His humanistic religious orientation is reflected in his poetic studies of Messenius, in whose dramas he acted, in his dissertations in ethics and in his position as informant to his relatives, the sons of Lutheran-Melanchthonic Archbishop [[Petrus Kenicius]].\n\nAfter studying in Uppsala, J came in no less than seven years, 1618\u201325, to have Europe as his university. He made his first foreign study trip in 1618-20, mainly to the Hessian university in Giessen. He deepened his piety focus during studies for the major ethical-religious-oriented theologian, university, church and school reformer B Mentzer. Significant both for his influential relationships, for his study orientation and curiosity in Europe, he made only a brief guest visit to his home country between his two long foreign trips and that he was awarded the salary of 1621 newly appointed professor poesos at Uppsala university.\n\nHis second course of study was crucial to his life's work. In spite of all Lutheran-confessional regulations and scholastic-theological educational goals, he got to know in Western Europe (Holland, England and France) the ethico-religious renaissance, not least in England, where the reaction was to the Calvinist neo-confessionalism, which prevailed at the Dordrecht Synod in 1619, and which J himself faced in a dissertation in Giessen.\n\n=== Professorship and Rectorship ===\n\nBy the time Gothus returned home at the age of 32, he was a mature man with European broad-mindedness like no other Swedish theologian. He immediately became professor of theology at [[Uppsala University]] and rector and professor of the newly founded [[Collegium Illustre]] in Stockholm. At the time of the House of Knight's establishment, the king realised that the nobility needed education in order to maintain their position. Already in the preamble of the knight house order, the long-gone plans of a special school, exclusive to the nobility and located at the knight house, were clarified. \n\nThis teaching work was subsequently established in 1626 and was initially a success. The seven-year schooling, was the idea, would prepare the noble youngster for a career in the top tier of the kingdom. Later Bishop Johannes Matthi\u00e6 Gothus was appointed professor and principal. One of the school's facilitators, the Swedish National Council [[Johan Skytte]], had the room decorated for teaching and published textbooks. [[Gustavus Adolphus]], who sometimes heard about the school's disputes, promised on April 24, 1627, an annual grant from the state funds for this so-called [[Collegium illustre]] on 2,000 dollars silver coins. The rest of the costs were taken out of the knight's house.\n\nThe Swedish Council, [[Johan Skytte]], had the main leadership in its establishment and governance. Gothus provided the curriculum, Ratio studiorum; Plan of Studies. One of the most characteristic features of humanistic pedagogy was the practice of keeping notebooks; schoolboys were encouraged to compile commonplace books for reference use when they could read and write reasonably accurately. Ratio Studiorum lavishes praise on notebook practice. Like numerous humanistic teaching programmes, it suggests tha students should excerpt sentences, proverbs, similes and other literary elemens, write them down in a notebook and memorise them. According to Gothus, a schoolboy should begin at the age of eight with moral sentences of [[Publilius Syrus]], [[Terence]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Cato]] and [[Cicero]]; at the age of ten, he should be introduced to sentences by Greek authors, first in Latin translations, later in the original Greek version.  \n\nThe educational system consisted of a lower and a higher department. In the lower, which was seven-class and intended for children between seven and fourteen years of age, teaching was preferably communicated in the classical languages and French; in the higher, \"auditorium publicum\", lectures were held in philosophy, mathematics and eloquence. The intention was, in time, to include lectures that also cover theology, law and medicine or, in other words, to form a full university in the capital. At the college, disputes were published and defended. The number of professors was three. The first teachers were: Johannes Matthi\u00e6 Gothus, author of the above-mentioned curriculum and finally bishop of Str\u00e4ngn\u00e4s diocese, [[Vilhelm Simonius]] and J\u00f6ran Lilja alias [[Georg Stiernhielm]] and, after his departure in 1628, [[Jacobus Boose Rudbeckius]]. Once at school, each day began and ended with prayer and Bible reading. In between, lessons were held in both classical and modern languages such as dialectics, rhetoric, physics and mathematics. Exercises were an important element in which teaching of singing, dance and instruments was interspersed with more warlike training in the preparation of troops as well as martial and equestrian art. Among the celebrities who attended the school were among the teachers J\u00f6ran Olofsson Lilja, later known as the bald Georg Stiernhielm, and among the students the future field master [[Carl Gustaf Wrangel]].\n\nThe teachers' salaries were paid partly by the state (annual appropriation of 2000 dollars of copper coins, according to the royal letter of 27 April 1627) and partly by the knight house fund. The plague in 1629 interrupted the college's activities. At the same time, Johannes Matthi\u00e6 Gothus and [[Simonius]] were drawn to other fields of work. Rudbeckius was retained at work and pay until 1632, when his resignation college completely ceased. \nCollegium illustrations came to be short-lived. In 1629 the plague ravaged Stockholm and the nobility left the city. The lecture rooms were empty and the teachers undertook other assignments. It was formally dissolved three years later.\n\n\n[[File:Johannes Matthiae Gothus.jpg|left|thumb]]\n\n=== Court Pastor and Military Bishop ===\n\nJohannes Matthiae Gothus was appointed court pastor. In 1630-32 he accompanied king [[Gustavus Adolphus]] during the German campaign as field bishop in the [[Thirty Years' War]] and was responsible for the ecumenical negotiations with [[Durie]], which he completed during his stay in Sweden as an English envoy in 1636-38. During his time in Germany, he was, among other things, responsible for stocktaking of the books of [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] and many other cities. He had enjoyed [[Gustavus Adolphus]] full confidence and was appointed by him to deal with Kristina's upbringing (1633\u201343) with all the delicate religious-personal and ecumenical problems this involved with reformed family relations within the country and intended reformed goal for the young queen, both the current reform pedagogy and his foreign experience at the church board organisation.\n\nIn the conflicts surrounding [[Joannes Baazius]] and [[Johannes Rudbeckius]] during these years, he stands by his Presbyterianism close to Baazius parish and in his aristocratic episcopalism the accused of his freedom of the church J Rudbeckius. At the same time, he differs from both Baazius state church view and the bishops' confessional stance through his humanistic view of the Christian king's and laymen's role in the church. His reform pedagogy is expressed in his curriculum in 1626, in his textbooks in 1627 and 1635, and above all in his catechetical textbooks. In these, his ethico-religious anti-denominational basic view and dependence on Western European laymanism are expressed, as well as in his initiative to found the first Swedish orphanage in Stockholm in 1633. A theological analysis shows that there is an ethico-religious continuity between his lus puerilis 1626, his Institutio religionis christianae 1642, in which he presents the teaching he gave to Kristina, and his writings after Kristina's conversion to Catholicism, his dogmatically set work Regula credendi et vivendi, 1656, in which he defends himself against the accusation of being responsible for Christina's apostasy, and his Sum then overcomes pure salvation of Catholic Christian doctrine, where in 1656 he gives Kristina her pastoral care (cura animarum) for her Rome stay.\n\n=== Queen Christina's Teacher ===\n\nAfter the king's death, a guardian board was appointed, headed by the chancellor, [[Axel Oxenstierna]]. [[Gustavus Adolphus]] had left instructions for her daughter's upbringing and selected her future governors and preceptors. It was considered of great importance that these were indigenous men - [[Axel Ban\u00e9r]] was appointed governor and [[Gustaf Kristersson Horn af \u00c5minne]] as sub-governor. The teacher who would have the most long-term influence on the Queen was Johannes Matthiae Gothus who taught her classical languages, science, history and religion. The goals of Kristina's upbringing as regent were regulated by the report of the States on March 24, 1635. Kristina would learn something about foreign customs because they were necessary for her rank and position, but she would \"dress up\" in the natives in the first place. The essence of her studies would be the word of God, the articles of Christianity, and all Christian virtues. It was emphasised that she would not be infected with \"Papacy or Calvinist willpower\". \n\nThe guardians did everything to realise this command. Kristina was taught male sports, riding and hunting, and nature had not denied her any trait that would have been an honor for a young man. Her intellectual prowess was astonishing. She seemed to have no limits to her ability to acquire knowledge, and her teacher, Johannes Matthi\u00e6, stuffed her full of all kinds of knowledge. She now learned o later to speak o partially write most living cultural languages, French, German, Italian and Dutch, in addition Latin o had knowledge of Greek, Hebrew and Arabic as well. Her scientific interest was mainly focused on classical philology, philosophy, theology, mathematics and astronomy. When Johannes Matthi\u00e6 laid the foundation, then came Sweden's greatest statesman, Axel Oxenstierna himself, and introduced her to the duties of public life. Here, too, her powers failed. When she was seven years old, the Swedish queen Gabriel Oxenstierna wrote to Axel Oxenstierna: \"Our young queen has an extraordinary stately engineering.\" A few years later, Axel Oxenstierna in the Swedish National Council stated: \"Her Royal Majesty lets her see specimens about her gender and age!\"; \"God knows how dear it is to me to see that Her Majesty is not like a woman person, but with a good sense of the good.\"\n\nOn Dec 8, 44, K was born. She was eighteen years old then. Some time later, French diplomat Pierre Chanut drew a picture of her. He is full of admiration. She speaks French, as if she were born in the Louvre, or Latin as her native language, he writes; she loves poetry, literature and books, has a rare spiritual agility, a quick, safe, unusually wide-eyed view, is wise and restrained; energetic in her work and constantly in motion, she devotes herself entirely to the occupations of an old statesman or philosopher. In the future, Chanut adds, the so-called queen wants to govern her own country o and strives to acquire practice o experience for this by treading the Council's meetings o carefully taking into account all existing government matters.\n\nQueen Kristina's relationship with her teacher was close; so close, he became like a father to her. She referred to him as father.\n\n=== Later Career and Disputes ===\n\n[[File:Johannes Matthiae ett kopparstick.jpg|thumb|]]\n\n=== Bishop of Str\u00e4ngn\u00e4s ===\n\n== Authorship ==\n\nGothus authored numerous writings that spread throughout much of 17th-century Europe. He published at least 92 printed writings, of which 67 were books on religion, seven sermons, four on linguistics, of which one was on Latin grammar, which is still being used in schools in Italy today, three novels and two on education and pedagogy. Of these books, 61 are written in Latin, 28 in Swedish, of which seven are sermons. One book in German, one in Dutch and one in French.\n\n== Manors and Estates ==\n\nJohannes Matthiae received gifts and great fiefs from Christina, Queen of Sweden and the Queen Mother. He owned more than 33 large estates and farms and a number of smaller properties in different parts of Sweden. These were part of the crown payment.\n\n==Ancestors==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

It was emphasised that she would not be infected with \"Papacy or Calvinist willpower\". \n\nThe guardians did everything to realise this command. Kristina was taught male sports, riding and hunting, and nature had not denied her any trait that would have been an honor for a young man. Her intellectual prowess was astonishing. She seemed to have no limits to her ability to acquire knowledge, and her teacher, Johannes Matthi\u00e6, stuffed her full of all kinds of knowledge. She now learned o later to speak o partially write most living cultural languages, French, German, Italian and Dutch, in addition Latin o had knowledge of Greek, Hebrew and Arabic as well. Her scientific interest was mainly focused on classical philology, philosophy, theology, mathematics and astronomy. When Johannes Matthi\u00e6 laid the foundation, then came Sweden's greatest statesman, Axel Oxenstierna himself, and introduced her to the duties of public life. Here, too, her powers failed. When she was seven years old, the Swedish queen Gabriel Oxenstierna wrote to Axel Oxenstierna: \"Our young queen has an extraordinary stately engineering.\" A few years later, Axel Oxenstierna in the Swedish National Council stated: \"Her Royal Majesty lets her see specimens about her gender and age!\"; \"God knows how dear it is to me to see that Her Majesty is not like a woman person, but with a good sense of the good.\"\n\nOn Dec 8, 44, K was born. She was eighteen years old then. Some time later, French diplomat Pierre Chanut drew a picture of her. He is full of admiration. She speaks French, as if she were born in the Louvre, or Latin as her native language, he writes; she loves poetry, literature and books, has a rare spiritual agility, a quick, safe, unusually wide-eyed view, is wise and restrained; energetic in her work and constantly in motion, she devotes herself entirely to the occupations of an old statesman or philosopher. In the future, Chanut adds, the so-called queen wants to govern her own country o and strives to acquire practice o experience for this by treading the Council's meetings o carefully taking into account all existing government matters.\n\nQueen Kristina's relationship with her teacher was close; so close, he became like a father to her. She referred to him as father.\n\n=== Later Career and Disputes ===\n\n[[File:Johannes Matthiae ett kopparstick.jpg|thumb|]]\n\n=== Bishop of Str\u00e4ngn\u00e4s ===\n\n== Authorship ==\n\nGothus authored numerous writings that spread throughout much of 17th-century Europe. He published at least 92 printed writings, of which 67 were books on religion, seven sermons, four on linguistics, of which one was on Latin grammar, which is still being used in schools in Italy today, three novels and two on education and pedagogy. Of these books, 61 are written in Latin, 28 in Swedish, of which seven are sermons. One book in German, one in Dutch and one in French.\n\n== Manors and Estates ==\n\nJohannes Matthiae received gifts and great fiefs from Christina, Queen of Sweden and the Queen Mother. He owned more than 33 large estates and farms and a number of smaller properties in different parts of Sweden. These were part of the crown payment.\n\n==Ancestors==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

None include any higher names in the googol family (googolduplex, etc.). The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' comments that ''googol'' and ''googolplex'' are \"not in formal mathematical use\".\n\n==Usage of names of large numbers==\nSome names of large numbers, such as ''million'', ''billion'', and ''trillion'', have real referents in human experience, and are encountered in many contexts. At times, the names of large numbers have been forced into common usage as a result of [[hyperinflation]]. The highest numerical value banknote ever printed was a note for 1 sextillion [[peng\u0151]] (10<sup>21</sup> or 1 milliard bilpeng\u0151 as printed) printed in [[Hungary]] in 1946. In 2009, [[Zimbabwe]] printed a 100&nbsp;trillion (10<sup>14</sup>) [[Zimbabwean dollar]] note, which at the time of printing was worth about US$30.<ref name=zimbabwe>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7832601.stm|title=Zimbabwe rolls out Z$100tr note|publisher=BBC News|date=16 January 2009|accessdate=2009-01-16}}</ref>\n\nNames of larger numbers, however, have a tenuous, artificial existence, rarely found outside definitions, lists, and discussions of the ways in which large numbers are named. Even well-established names like ''sextillion'' are rarely used, since in the context of science, including astronomy, where such large numbers often occur, they are nearly always written using [[scientific notation]]. In this notation, powers of ten are expressed as ''10'' with a numeric superscript, e.g. \"The X-ray emission of the radio galaxy is {{val|1.3|e=45|u=joules}}.\" When a number such as 10<sup>45</sup> needs to be referred to in words, it is simply read out as \"ten to the forty-fifth\". This is easier to say and less ambiguous than \"quattuordecillion\", which means something different in the long scale and the short scale.\n\nWhen a number represents a quantity rather than a count, [[SI prefix]]es can be used\u2014thus \"femtosecond\", not \"one quadrillionth of a second\"\u2014although often powers of ten are used instead of some of the very high and very low prefixes. In some cases, specialized units are used, such as the astronomer's [[parsec]] and [[light year]] or the particle physicist's [[barn (unit)|barn]].\n\nNevertheless, large numbers have an intellectual fascination and are of mathematical interest, and giving them names is one of the ways in which people try to conceptualize and understand them.\n\nOne of the earliest examples of this is ''[[The Sand Reckoner]]'', in which [[Archimedes]] gave a system for naming large numbers. To do this, he called the numbers up to a [[myriad]] myriad (10<sup>8</sup>) \"first numbers\" and called 10<sup>8</sup> itself the \"unit of the second numbers\". Multiples of this unit then became the second numbers, up to this unit taken a myriad myriad times, 10<sup>8</sup>\u00b710<sup>8</sup>=10<sup>16</sup>. This became the \"unit of the third numbers\", whose multiples were the third numbers, and so on. Archimedes continued naming numbers in this way up to a myriad myriad times the unit of the 10<sup>8</sup>-th numbers, i.e. <math>(10^8)^{(10^8)}=10^{8\\cdot 10^8},</math> and embedded this construction within another copy of itself to produce names for numbers up to <math>((10^8)^{(10^8)})^{(10^8)}=10^{8\\cdot 10^{16}}.</math> Archimedes then estimated the number of grains of sand that would be required to fill the known universe, and found that it was no more than \"one thousand myriad of the eighth numbers\" (10<sup>63</sup>).\n\nSince then, many others have engaged in the pursuit of conceptualizing and naming numbers that really have no existence outside the imagination. One motivation for such a pursuit is that attributed to the inventor of the word ''[[googol]]'', who was certain that any finite number \"had to have a name\". Another possible motivation is competition between students in computer programming courses, where a common exercise is that of writing a program to output numbers in the form of English words.\n\nMost names proposed for large numbers belong to systematic schemes which are extensible. Thus, many names for large numbers are simply the result of following a naming system to its logical conclusion\u2014or extending it further.\n\n==Origins of the \"standard dictionary numbers\"==\n[[File:Chuquet.gif|right|500px]]\n\nThe&nbsp;words ''bymillion'' and ''trimillion'' were first recorded in 1475 in a manuscript of [[Jehan Adam]]. Subsequently, [[Nicolas Chuquet]] wrote a book ''Triparty en la science des nombres'' which was not published during Chuquet's lifetime. However, most of it was copied by [[Estienne de La Roche]] for a portion of his 1520 book, ''[[L'arismetique]]''. Chuquet's book contains a passage in which he shows a large number marked off into groups of six digits, with the comment:\n\n<blockquote>\nOu qui veult le premier point peult signiffier million Le second point byllion Le tiers point tryllion Le quart quadrillion Le cinq<sup>e</sup> quyllion Le six<sup>e</sup> sixlion Le sept.<sup>e</sup> septyllion Le huyt<sup>e</sup> ottyllion Le neuf<sup>e</sup> nonyllion et ainsi des ault'<sup>s</sup> se plus oultre on vouloit preceder\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n(Or if you prefer the first mark can signify million, the second mark byllion, the third mark tryllion, the fourth quadrillion, the fifth quyillion, the sixth sixlion, the seventh septyllion, the eighth ottyllion, the ninth nonyllion and so on with others as far as you wish to go).\n</blockquote>\n\nAdam and Chuquet used the [[long and short scales|long scale]] of powers of a million; that is, Adam's ''bymillion'' (Chuquet's ''byllion'') denoted 10<sup>12</sup>, and Adam's ''trimillion'' (Chuquet's ''tryllion'') denoted 10<sup>18</sup>.\n\n==The googol family==\nThe names ''[[googol]]'' and ''[[googolplex]]'' were invented by [[Edward Kasner]]'s nephew Milton Sirotta and introduced in Kasner and Newman's 1940 book ''[[Mathematics and the Imagination]]''<ref>Kasner, Edward, and James Newman, ''Mathematics and the Imagination,'' 1940, Simon and Schuster, New York.</ref>\nin the following passage:\n{{quote|The name \"googol\" was invented by a child (Dr. Kasner's nine-year-old nephew) who was asked to think up a name for a very big number, namely 1 with one hundred zeroes after it. He was very certain that this number was not infinite, and therefore equally certain that it had to have a name. At the same time that he suggested \"googol\" he gave a name for a still larger number: \"Googolplex\". A googolplex is much larger than a googol, but is still finite, as the inventor of the name was quick to point out. It was first suggested that a googolplex should be 1, followed by writing zeros until you got tired. This is a description of what would actually happen if one actually tried to write a googolplex, but different people get tired at different times and it would never do to have [[Primo Carnera|Carnera]] a better mathematician than [[Albert Einstein|Dr. Einstein]], simply because he had more endurance. The googolplex is, then, a specific finite number, equal to 1 with a googol zeros after it.}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=200 | Value\n! Name\n!

This gives rise to the name ''googolplexplex'' for 10<sup>googolplex</sup> = 10{{sup|10{{sup|10{{sup|100}}}}}}. This number (ten to the power of a googolplex) is also known as a googolduplex and googolplexian.<ref>Bowers, Jonathan. \"Infinity Scrapers\". Polytope, 2010.</ref> Conway and Guy<ref name=a /> have proposed that ''N-minex'' be used as a name for 10<sup>\u2212N</sup>, giving rise to the name ''googolminex'' for the [[Reciprocal (mathematics)|reciprocal]] of a googolplex. None of these names are in wide use, nor are any currently found in dictionaries.\n\nThe names ''googol'' and ''googolplex'' inspired the name of the [[Dot-com company|Internet company]] [[Google]] and its [[corporate headquarters]], the [[Googleplex]], respectively.\n\n==Extensions of the standard dictionary numbers==\nThis section illustrates several systems for naming large numbers, and shows how they can be extended past ''vigintillion''.\n\nTraditional British usage assigned new names for each power of one million (the [[long and short scales|long scale]]): {{nowrap|1,000,000 {{=}} 1 million}}; {{nowrap|1,000,000<sup>2</sup> {{=}} 1 billion}}; {{nowrap|1,000,000<sup>3</sup> {{=}} 1 trillion}}; and so on. It was adapted from French usage, and is similar to the system that was documented or invented by [[Nicolas Chuquet|Chuquet]].\n\nTraditional American usage (which was also adapted from French usage but at a later date), Canadian, and modern British usage assign new names for each power of one thousand (the [[long and short scales|short scale]].) Thus, a ''billion'' is 1000 \u00d7 1000<sup>2</sup> = 10<sup>9</sup>; a ''trillion'' is 1000 \u00d7 1000<sup>3</sup> = 10<sup>12</sup>; and so forth. Due to its dominance in the financial world (and by the [[US dollar]]), this was adopted for official [[United Nations]] documents.\n\nTraditional French usage has varied; in 1948, France, which had been using the short scale, reverted to the long scale.\n\nThe term ''milliard'' is unambiguous and always means 10<sup>9</sup>. It is almost never seen in American usage and rarely in British usage, but frequently in continental European usage. The term is sometimes attributed to French mathematician [[Jacques Peletier du Mans]] circa 1550 (for this reason, the long scale is also known as the ''Chuquet-Peletier'' system), but the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] states that the term derives from post-Classical [[Latin]] term ''milliartum'', which became ''milliare'' and then ''milliart'' and finally our modern term.\n\nWith regard to names ending in -illiard for numbers 10<sup>6''n''+3</sup>, ''milliard'' is certainly in widespread use in languages other than English, but the degree of actual use of the larger terms is questionable. The terms \"Milliarde\" in German, \"miljard\" in Dutch, \"milyar\" in Turkish and \"\u043c\u0438\u043b\u043b\u0438\u0430\u0440\u0434\" in Russian are standard usage when discussing financial topics.\n\nFor additional details, see [[billion (disambiguation)|billion]] and [[long and short scales]].\n\nThe naming procedure for large numbers is based on taking the number ''n'' occurring in 10<sup>3''n''+3</sup> (short scale) or 10<sup>6''n''</sup> (long scale) and concatenating Latin roots for its units, tens, and hundreds place, together with the suffix ''-illion''. In this way, numbers up to 10<sup>3\u00b7999+3</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;10<sup>3000</sup> (short scale) or 10<sup>6\u00b7999</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;10<sup>5994</sup> (long scale) may be named. The choice of roots and the concatenation procedure is that of the standard dictionary numbers if ''n'' is 20 or smaller. For larger ''n'' (between 21 and 999), prefixes can be constructed based on a system described by [[John Horton Conway]] and [[Richard K. Guy]]:<ref name=a />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\n!Units\n!Tens\n!Hundreds\n|-\n!1\n|Un\n|<sup>N</sup> Deci\n|<sup>NX</sup> Centi\n|-\n!2\n|Duo\n|<sup>MS</sup> Viginti\n|<sup>N</sup> Ducenti\n|-\n!3\n|Tre {{ref|increase|(*)}}\n|<sup>NS</sup> Triginta\n|<sup>NS</sup> Trecenti\n|-\n!4\n|Quattuor\n|<sup>NS</sup> Quadraginta\n|<sup>NS</sup> Quadringenti\n|-\n!5\n|Quinqua\n|<sup>NS</sup> Quinquaginta\n|<sup>NS</sup> Quingenti\n|-\n!6\n|Se {{ref|increase|(*)}}\n|<sup>N</sup> Sexaginta\n|<sup>N</sup> Sescenti\n|-\n!7\n|Septe {{ref|increase|(*)}}\n|<sup>N</sup> Septuaginta\n|<sup>N</sup> Septingenti\n|-\n!8\n|Octo\n|<sup>MX</sup> Octoginta\n|<sup>MX</sup> Octingenti\n|-\n!9\n|Nove {{ref|increase|(*)}}\n|Nonaginta\n|Nongenti\n|}\n:<sup>(*)</sup> {{note|increase}} When preceding a component marked <sup>S</sup> or <sup>X</sup>, \u201ctre\u201d changes to \u201ctres\u201d and \u201cse\u201d to \u201cses\u201d or \u201csex\u201d; similarly, when preceding a component marked <sup>M</sup> or <sup>N</sup>, \u201csepte\u201d and \u201cnove\u201d change to \u201cseptem\u201d and \u201cnovem\u201d or \u201csepten\u201d and \u201cnoven\u201d.\n\nSince the system of using Latin prefixes will become ambiguous for numbers with exponents of a size which the Romans rarely counted to, like 10<sup>6,000,258</sup>, Conway and Guy have also proposed a consistent set of conventions which permit, in principle, the extension of this system to provide English names for any integer whatsoever.<ref name=a />\n\nThe following table shows number names generated by the system described by Conway and Guy for the short and long scales.\n\n'''Names of reciprocals of large numbers''' are not listed, as they are regularly formed by adding -th, e.g. ''quattuordecillionth,'' ''centillionth,'' etc.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Base -illion<br />([[long and short scales|short scale]])\n!Base -illion<br />([[long and short scales|long scale]])\n!Value\n!

None include any higher names in the googol family (googolduplex, etc.). The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' comments that ''googol'' and ''googolplex'' are \"not in formal mathematical use\".\n\n==Usage of names of large numbers==\nSome names of large numbers, such as ''million'', ''billion'', and ''trillion'', have real referents in human experience, and are encountered in many contexts. At times, the names of large numbers have been forced into common usage as a result of [[hyperinflation]]. The highest numerical value banknote ever printed was a note for 1 sextillion [[peng\u0151]] (10<sup>21</sup> or 1 milliard bilpeng\u0151 as printed) printed in [[Hungary]] in 1946. In 2009, [[Zimbabwe]] printed a 100&nbsp;trillion (10<sup>14</sup>) [[Zimbabwean dollar]] note, which at the time of printing was worth about US$30.<ref name=zimbabwe>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7832601.stm|title=Zimbabwe rolls out Z$100tr note|publisher=BBC News|date=16 January 2009|accessdate=2009-01-16}}</ref>\n\nNames of larger numbers, however, have a tenuous, artificial existence, rarely found outside definitions, lists, and discussions of the ways in which large numbers are named. Even well-established names like ''sextillion'' are rarely used, since in the context of science, including astronomy, where such large numbers often occur, they are nearly always written using [[scientific notation]]. In this notation, powers of ten are expressed as ''10'' with a numeric superscript, e.g. \"The X-ray emission of the radio galaxy is {{val|1.3|e=45|u=joules}}.\" When a number such as 10<sup>45</sup> needs to be referred to in words, it is simply read out as \"ten to the forty-fifth\". This is easier to say and less ambiguous than \"quattuordecillion\", which means something different in the long scale and the short scale.\n\nWhen a number represents a quantity rather than a count, [[SI prefix]]es can be used\u2014thus \"femtosecond\", not \"one quadrillionth of a second\"\u2014although often powers of ten are used instead of some of the very high and very low prefixes. In some cases, specialized units are used, such as the astronomer's [[parsec]] and [[light year]] or the particle physicist's [[barn (unit)|barn]].\n\nNevertheless, large numbers have an intellectual fascination and are of mathematical interest, and giving them names is one of the ways in which people try to conceptualize and understand them.\n\nOne of the earliest examples of this is ''[[The Sand Reckoner]]'', in which [[Archimedes]] gave a system for naming large numbers. To do this, he called the numbers up to a [[myriad]] myriad (10<sup>8</sup>) \"first numbers\" and called 10<sup>8</sup> itself the \"unit of the second numbers\". Multiples of this unit then became the second numbers, up to this unit taken a myriad myriad times, 10<sup>8</sup>\u00b710<sup>8</sup>=10<sup>16</sup>. This became the \"unit of the third numbers\", whose multiples were the third numbers, and so on. Archimedes continued naming numbers in this way up to a myriad myriad times the unit of the 10<sup>8</sup>-th numbers, i.e. <math>(10^8)^{(10^8)}=10^{8\\cdot 10^8},</math> and embedded this construction within another copy of itself to produce names for numbers up to <math>((10^8)^{(10^8)})^{(10^8)}=10^{8\\cdot 10^{16}}.</math> Archimedes then estimated the number of grains of sand that would be required to fill the known universe, and found that it was no more than \"one thousand myriad of the eighth numbers\" (10<sup>63</sup>).\n\nSince then, many others have engaged in the pursuit of conceptualizing and naming numbers that really have no existence outside the imagination. One motivation for such a pursuit is that attributed to the inventor of the word ''[[googol]]'', who was certain that any finite number \"had to have a name\". Another possible motivation is competition between students in computer programming courses, where a common exercise is that of writing a program to output numbers in the form of English words.\n\nMost names proposed for large numbers belong to systematic schemes which are extensible. Thus, many names for large numbers are simply the result of following a naming system to its logical conclusion\u2014or extending it further.\n\n==Origins of the \"standard dictionary numbers\"==\n[[File:Chuquet.gif|right|500px]]\n\nThe&nbsp;words ''bymillion'' and ''trimillion'' were first recorded in 1475 in a manuscript of [[Jehan Adam]]. Subsequently, [[Nicolas Chuquet]] wrote a book ''Triparty en la science des nombres'' which was not published during Chuquet's lifetime. However, most of it was copied by [[Estienne de La Roche]] for a portion of his 1520 book, ''[[L'arismetique]]''. Chuquet's book contains a passage in which he shows a large number marked off into groups of six digits, with the comment:\n\n<blockquote>\nOu qui veult le premier point peult signiffier million Le second point byllion Le tiers point tryllion Le quart quadrillion Le cinq<sup>e</sup> quyllion Le six<sup>e</sup> sixlion Le sept.<sup>e</sup> septyllion Le huyt<sup>e</sup> ottyllion Le neuf<sup>e</sup> nonyllion et ainsi des ault'<sup>s</sup> se plus oultre on vouloit preceder\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n(Or if you prefer the first mark can signify million, the second mark byllion, the third mark tryllion, the fourth quadrillion, the fifth quyillion, the sixth sixlion, the seventh septyllion, the eighth ottyllion, the ninth nonyllion and so on with others as far as you wish to go).\n</blockquote>\n\nAdam and Chuquet used the [[long and short scales|long scale]] of powers of a million; that is, Adam's ''bymillion'' (Chuquet's ''byllion'') denoted 10<sup>12</sup>, and Adam's ''trimillion'' (Chuquet's ''tryllion'') denoted 10<sup>18</sup>.\n\n==The googol family==\nThe names ''[[googol]]'' and ''[[googolplex]]'' were invented by [[Edward Kasner]]'s nephew Milton Sirotta and introduced in Kasner and Newman's 1940 book ''[[Mathematics and the Imagination]]''<ref>Kasner, Edward, and James Newman, ''Mathematics and the Imagination,'' 1940, Simon and Schuster, New York.</ref>\nin the following passage:\n{{quote|The name \"googol\" was invented by a child (Dr. Kasner's nine-year-old nephew) who was asked to think up a name for a very big number, namely 1 with one hundred zeroes after it. He was very certain that this number was not infinite, and therefore equally certain that it had to have a name. At the same time that he suggested \"googol\" he gave a name for a still larger number: \"Googolplex\". A googolplex is much larger than a googol, but is still finite, as the inventor of the name was quick to point out. It was first suggested that a googolplex should be 1, followed by writing zeros until you got tired. This is a description of what would actually happen if one actually tried to write a googolplex, but different people get tired at different times and it would never do to have [[Primo Carnera|Carnera]] a better mathematician than [[Albert Einstein|Dr. Einstein]], simply because he had more endurance. The googolplex is, then, a specific finite number, equal to 1 with a googol zeros after it.}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=200 | Value\n! Name\n!

This number (ten to the power of a googolplex) is also known as a googolduplex and googolplexian.<ref>Bowers, Jonathan. \"Infinity Scrapers\". Polytope, 2010.</ref> Conway and Guy<ref name=a /> have proposed that ''N-minex'' be used as a name for 10<sup>\u2212N</sup>, giving rise to the name ''googolminex'' for the [[Reciprocal (mathematics)|reciprocal]] of a googolplex. None of these names are in wide use, nor are any currently found in dictionaries.\n\nThe names ''googol'' and ''googolplex'' inspired the name of the [[Dot-com company|Internet company]] [[Google]] and its [[corporate headquarters]], the [[Googleplex]], respectively.\n\n==Extensions of the standard dictionary numbers==\nThis section illustrates several systems for naming large numbers, and shows how they can be extended past ''vigintillion''.\n\nTraditional British usage assigned new names for each power of one million (the [[long and short scales|long scale]]): {{nowrap|1,000,000 {{=}} 1 million}}; {{nowrap|1,000,000<sup>2</sup> {{=}} 1 billion}}; {{nowrap|1,000,000<sup>3</sup> {{=}} 1 trillion}}; and so on. It was adapted from French usage, and is similar to the system that was documented or invented by [[Nicolas Chuquet|Chuquet]].\n\nTraditional American usage (which was also adapted from French usage but at a later date), Canadian, and modern British usage assign new names for each power of one thousand (the [[long and short scales|short scale]].) Thus, a ''billion'' is 1000 \u00d7 1000<sup>2</sup> = 10<sup>9</sup>; a ''trillion'' is 1000 \u00d7 1000<sup>3</sup> = 10<sup>12</sup>; and so forth. Due to its dominance in the financial world (and by the [[US dollar]]), this was adopted for official [[United Nations]] documents.\n\nTraditional French usage has varied; in 1948, France, which had been using the short scale, reverted to the long scale.\n\nThe term ''milliard'' is unambiguous and always means 10<sup>9</sup>. It is almost never seen in American usage and rarely in British usage, but frequently in continental European usage. The term is sometimes attributed to French mathematician [[Jacques Peletier du Mans]] circa 1550 (for this reason, the long scale is also known as the ''Chuquet-Peletier'' system), but the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] states that the term derives from post-Classical [[Latin]] term ''milliartum'', which became ''milliare'' and then ''milliart'' and finally our modern term.\n\nWith regard to names ending in -illiard for numbers 10<sup>6''n''+3</sup>, ''milliard'' is certainly in widespread use in languages other than English, but the degree of actual use of the larger terms is questionable. The terms \"Milliarde\" in German, \"miljard\" in Dutch, \"milyar\" in Turkish and \"\u043c\u0438\u043b\u043b\u0438\u0430\u0440\u0434\" in Russian are standard usage when discussing financial topics.\n\nFor additional details, see [[billion (disambiguation)|billion]] and [[long and short scales]].\n\nThe naming procedure for large numbers is based on taking the number ''n'' occurring in 10<sup>3''n''+3</sup> (short scale) or 10<sup>6''n''</sup> (long scale) and concatenating Latin roots for its units, tens, and hundreds place, together with the suffix ''-illion''. In this way, numbers up to 10<sup>3\u00b7999+3</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;10<sup>3000</sup> (short scale) or 10<sup>6\u00b7999</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;10<sup>5994</sup> (long scale) may be named. The choice of roots and the concatenation procedure is that of the standard dictionary numbers if ''n'' is 20 or smaller. For larger ''n'' (between 21 and 999), prefixes can be constructed based on a system described by [[John Horton Conway]] and [[Richard K. Guy]]:<ref name=a />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\n!Units\n!Tens\n!Hundreds\n|-\n!1\n|Un\n|<sup>N</sup> Deci\n|<sup>NX</sup> Centi\n|-\n!2\n|Duo\n|<sup>MS</sup> Viginti\n|<sup>N</sup> Ducenti\n|-\n!3\n|Tre {{ref|increase|(*)}}\n|<sup>NS</sup> Triginta\n|<sup>NS</sup> Trecenti\n|-\n!4\n|Quattuor\n|<sup>NS</sup> Quadraginta\n|<sup>NS</sup> Quadringenti\n|-\n!5\n|Quinqua\n|<sup>NS</sup> Quinquaginta\n|<sup>NS</sup> Quingenti\n|-\n!6\n|Se {{ref|increase|(*)}}\n|<sup>N</sup> Sexaginta\n|<sup>N</sup> Sescenti\n|-\n!7\n|Septe {{ref|increase|(*)}}\n|<sup>N</sup> Septuaginta\n|<sup>N</sup> Septingenti\n|-\n!8\n|Octo\n|<sup>MX</sup> Octoginta\n|<sup>MX</sup> Octingenti\n|-\n!9\n|Nove {{ref|increase|(*)}}\n|Nonaginta\n|Nongenti\n|}\n:<sup>(*)</sup> {{note|increase}} When preceding a component marked <sup>S</sup> or <sup>X</sup>, \u201ctre\u201d changes to \u201ctres\u201d and \u201cse\u201d to \u201cses\u201d or \u201csex\u201d; similarly, when preceding a component marked <sup>M</sup> or <sup>N</sup>, \u201csepte\u201d and \u201cnove\u201d change to \u201cseptem\u201d and \u201cnovem\u201d or \u201csepten\u201d and \u201cnoven\u201d.\n\nSince the system of using Latin prefixes will become ambiguous for numbers with exponents of a size which the Romans rarely counted to, like 10<sup>6,000,258</sup>, Conway and Guy have also proposed a consistent set of conventions which permit, in principle, the extension of this system to provide English names for any integer whatsoever.<ref name=a />\n\nThe following table shows number names generated by the system described by Conway and Guy for the short and long scales.\n\n'''Names of reciprocals of large numbers''' are not listed, as they are regularly formed by adding -th, e.g. ''quattuordecillionth,'' ''centillionth,'' etc.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Base -illion<br />([[long and short scales|short scale]])\n!Base -illion<br />([[long and short scales|long scale]])\n!Value\n!

A '''hyperboloid''' is a surface that may be obtained from a hyperboloid of revolution by deforming it by means of directional [[scaling (geometry)|scaling]]s, or more generally, of an [[affine transformation]].\n\nA hyperboloid is a [[quadric surface]], that is a [[surface (mathematics)|surface]] that may be defined as the [[zero set]] of a [[polynomial]] of degree two in three variables. Among quadric surfaces, a hyperboloid is characterized by not being a [[conical surface|cone]] or a [[cylinder]], having a [[central symmetry|center of symmetry]], and intersecting many [[plane (geometry)|planes]] into hyperbolas. A hyperboloid has also three pairwise [[perpendicular]] [[rotational symmetry|axes of symmetry]], and three pairwise perpendicular [[reflection symmetry|planes of symmetry]].\n\nGiven a hyperboloid, if one chooses a [[Cartesian coordinate system]] whose axes are axes of symmetry of the hyperboloid, and origin is the center of symmetry of the hyperboloid, then the hyperboloid may be defined by one of the two following equations:\n:<math> {x^2 \\over a^2} + {y^2 \\over b^2} - {z^2 \\over c^2}= 1,</math> \nor\n:<math> {x^2 \\over a^2} + {y^2 \\over b^2} - {z^2 \\over c^2}= -1.</math>\nBoth of these surfaces are [[asymptotic]] to the cone of equation \n:<math> {x^2 \\over a^2} + {y^2 \\over b^2} - {z^2 \\over c^2} = 0 .</math>\nOne has a hyperboloid of revolution if and only if <math>a^2=b^2.</math> Otherwise, the axes are uniquely defined ([[up to]] the exchange of the ''x''-axis and the ''y''-axis.\n\nThere are two kinds of hyperboloids. In the first case ({{math|+1}} in the right-hand side of the equation), one has a '''one-sheet hyperboloid''', also called '''hyperbolic hyperboloid'''. It is a [[connected set|connected surface]], which has a negative [[Gaussian curvature]] at every point. This implies near every point, the intersection of the hyperboloid and its [[tangent plane]] at the point consists of two branches of curve that have distinct tangents at the point. In the case of one-sheet hyperboloid, these branches of curves are [[line (geometry)|lines]], and thus the one-sheet hyperboloid is a [[doubly ruled]] surface.\n\nIn the second case ({{math|\u22121}} in the right-hand side of the equation), one has a '''two-sheet hyperboloid''', also called '''elliptic hyperboloid'''. The surface has two [[connected component (topology)|connected component]]s, and a positive Gaussian curvature at every point. Thus the surface is ''convex'' in the sense that the tangent plane at every point intersects the surface only in this point.\n\n== Parametric representations ==\n[[File:Cylinder - hyperboloid - cone.gif|thumb|Animation of a hyperboloid of revolution]]\nCartesian coordinates for the hyperboloids can be defined, similar to [[spherical coordinates]], keeping the [[azimuth]] angle {{math|''\u03b8'' \u2208 {{closed-open|0, 2''\u03c0''}}}}, but changing inclination {{math|''v''}} into [[hyperbolic trigonometric function]]s:\n\nOne-surface hyperboloid: {{math|''v'' \u2208 {{open-open|\u2212&infin;, &infin;}}}}\n:<math>\\begin{align} x&=a \\cosh v \\cos\\theta \\\\ y&=b \\cosh v \\sin\\theta \\\\ z&=c \\sinh v \\end{align}</math>\n\nTwo-surface hyperboloid: {{math|''v'' \u2208 {{closed-open|0, &infin;}}}}\n:<math>\\begin{align} x&=a \\sinh v \\cos\\theta \\\\ y&=b \\sinh v \\sin\\theta \\\\ z&=\\pm c \\cosh v \\end{align}</math>\n[[File:Hyperboloid-1s.svg|thumb|hyperboloid of one sheet: generation by a rotating hyperbola (top) and line (bottom: red or blue)]]\n[[File:Hyperbo-1s-cut-all.svg|thumb|hyperboloid of one sheet: plane sections]]\n\n== Properties of a hyperboloid of one sheet ==\n=== Lines on the surface ===\n*A hyperboloid of one sheet contains two pencils of lines. It is a [[doubly ruled surface]]. \nIf the hyperboloid has the equation\n<math> {x^2 \\over a^2} + {y^2 \\over b^2} - {z^2 \\over c^2}= 1</math>  then the lines\n\n:<math>g^{\\pm}_{\\alpha}:\n \\vec{x}(t)=\\begin{pmatrix} a\\cos\\alpha\\\\ b\\sin\\alpha\\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}\n  + t\\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} -a\\sin\\alpha\\\\ b\\cos\\alpha\\\\ \\pm c\\end{pmatrix}\\ ,\\quad t\\in \\R,\\ 0\\le \\alpha\\le 2\\pi\\  </math>\nare contained in the surface.\n\nIn case <math>a=b</math> the hyperboloid is a surface of revolution and can be generated by rotating one of the two lines <math>g^{+}_{0}</math> or <math>g^{-}_{0}</math>, which are skew to the rotation axis (see picture). This property is called ''[[Christopher Wren|Wren]]'s theorem''.<ref> K. Strubecker: ''Vorlesungen der Darstellenden Geometrie.''

This is also true, but less obvious, in the general case (see [[circular section]]).\n\n''Remark:'' A hyperboloid of two sheets is ''projectively'' equivalent to a sphere.\n\n== Common parametric representation ==\nThe following parametric representation includes hyperboloids of one sheet, two sheets, and their common boundary cone, each with the <math>z</math>-axis as the axis of symmetry:\n\n<math>\\vec x(s,t)=\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{lll}\na \\sqrt{s^2+d} \\cos t\\\\\nb \\sqrt{s^2+d}  \\sin t\\\\\nc s\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n</math>\n\n*For <math>d>0</math> one obtains a hyperboloid of one sheet, \n*For <math>d<0</math> a hyperboloid of two sheets, and \n*For <math>d=0</math> a double cone.\n\nOne can obtain a parametric representation of a hyperboloid with a different coordinate axis as the axis of symmetry by shuffling the position of the <math>c s</math> term to the appropriate component in the equation above.\n\n== Symmetries of a hyperboloid ==\nThe hyperboloids with equations \n<math>\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} - \\frac{z^2}{c^2} = 1 , \\quad \\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} - \\frac{z^2}{c^2} = -1 \\ </math>\nare\n*''pointsymmetric'' to the origin,\n*''symmetric to the coordinate planes'' and\n*''rotational symmetric'' to the z-axis and symmetric to any plane containing the z-axis, in case of <math>a=b</math> (hyperboloid of revolution).\n\n== On the curvature of a hyperboloid ==\nWhereas the [[Gaussian curvature]] of a hyperboloid of one sheet is negative, that of a two-sheet hyperboloid is positive. In spite of its positive curvature, the hyperboloid of two sheets with another suitably chosen metric can also be used as a [[Hyperboloid model|model]] for hyperbolic geometry.\n\n==Generalised equations==\nMore generally, an arbitrarily oriented hyperboloid, centered at {{math|'''v'''}}, is defined by the equation\n:<math>(\\mathbf{x-v})^\\mathrm{T} A (\\mathbf{x-v}) = 1,</math>\nwhere {{math|''A''}} is a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] and {{math|'''x'''}}, {{math|'''v'''}} are [[euclidean vector|vectors]].\n\nThe [[eigenvector]]s of {{math|''A''}} define the principal directions of the hyperboloid and the [[eigenvalue]]s of A are the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]]s of the squares of the semi-axes: <math>{1/a^2}</math>, <math>{1/b^2}  </math> and <math>{1/c^2}</math>. The one-sheet hyperboloid has two positive eigenvalues and one negative eigenvalue. The two-sheet hyperboloid has one positive eigenvalue and two negative eigenvalues.\n\n==In more than three dimensions==\nImaginary hyperboloids are frequently found in mathematics of higher dimensions. For example, in a [[pseudo-Euclidean space]] one has the use of a [[quadratic form]]:\n: <math>q(x) = \\left(x_1^2+\\cdots + x_k^2\\right)-\\left(x_{k+1}^2+\\cdots + x_n^2\\right), \\quad k < n .</math> \nWhen {{math|''c''}} is any [[constant (mathematics)|constant]], then the part of the space given by\n:<math>\\lbrace x \\ :\\ q(x) = c \\rbrace </math>\nis called a ''hyperboloid''. The degenerate case corresponds to {{math|1=''c'' = 0}}.\n\nAs an example, consider the following passage:<ref>Thomas Hawkins (2000) ''Emergence of the Theory of Lie Groups: an essay in the history of mathematics, 1869\u20141926'', \u00a79.3 \"The Mathematization of Physics at G\u00f6ttingen\", see page 340, Springer {{ISBN|0-387-98963-3}}</ref>\n:... the velocity vectors always lie on a surface which Minkowski calls a four-dimensional hyperboloid since, expressed in terms of purely real coordinates {{math|(''y''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''y''<sub>4</sub>)}}, its equation is {{math|''y''{{su|b=1|p=2}} + ''y''{{su|b=2|p=2}} + ''y''{{su|b=3|p=2}} \u2212 ''y''{{su|b=4|p=2}} {{=}} \u22121}}, analogous to the hyperboloid {{math|''y''{{su|b=1|p=2}} + ''y''{{su|b=2|p=2}} \u2212 ''y''{{su|b=3|p=2}} {{=}} \u22121}} of three-dimensional space.{{refn|Minkowski used the term \"four-dimensional hyperboloid\" only once, in a posthumously-published typescript and this was non-standard usage, as Minkowski's hyperboloid is a three-dimensional submanifold of a four-dimensional Minkowski space <math>M^4.</math><ref>{{Citation|author=Walter, Scott A.|year=1999|contribution=The non-Euclidean style of Minkowskian relativity|editor=J.

A '''hyperboloid''' is a surface that may be obtained from a hyperboloid of revolution by deforming it by means of directional [[scaling (geometry)|scaling]]s, or more generally, of an [[affine transformation]].\n\nA hyperboloid is a [[quadric surface]], that is a [[surface (mathematics)|surface]] that may be defined as the [[zero set]] of a [[polynomial]] of degree two in three variables. Among quadric surfaces, a hyperboloid is characterized by not being a [[conical surface|cone]] or a [[cylinder]], having a [[central symmetry|center of symmetry]], and intersecting many [[plane (geometry)|planes]] into hyperbolas. A hyperboloid has also three pairwise [[perpendicular]] [[rotational symmetry|axes of symmetry]], and three pairwise perpendicular [[reflection symmetry|planes of symmetry]].\n\nGiven a hyperboloid, if one chooses a [[Cartesian coordinate system]] whose axes are axes of symmetry of the hyperboloid, and origin is the center of symmetry of the hyperboloid, then the hyperboloid may be defined by one of the two following equations:\n:<math> {x^2 \\over a^2} + {y^2 \\over b^2} - {z^2 \\over c^2}= 1,</math> \nor\n:<math> {x^2 \\over a^2} + {y^2 \\over b^2} - {z^2 \\over c^2}= -1.</math>\nBoth of these surfaces are [[asymptotic]] to the cone of equation \n:<math> {x^2 \\over a^2} + {y^2 \\over b^2} - {z^2 \\over c^2} = 0 .</math>\nOne has an hyperboloid of revolution if and only if <math>a^2=b^2.</math> Otherwise, the axes are uniquely defined ([[up to]] the exchange of the ''x''-axis and the ''y''-axis.\n\nThere are two kinds of hyperboloids. In the first case ({{math|+1}} in the right-hand side of the equation), one has a '''one-sheet hyperboloid''', also called '''hyperbolic hyperboloid'''. It is a [[connected set|connected surface]], which has a negative [[Gaussian curvature]] at every point. This implies near every point, the intersection of the hyperboloid and its [[tangent plane]] at the point consists of two branches of curve that have distinct tangents at the point. In the case of one-sheet hyperboloid, these branches of curves are [[line (geometry)|lines]], and thus the one-sheet hyperboloid is a [[doubly ruled]] surface.\n\nIn the second case ({{math|\u22121}} in the right-hand side of the equation), one has a '''two-sheet hyperboloid''', also called '''elliptic hyperboloid'''. The surface has two [[connected component (topology)|connected component]]s, and a positive Gaussian curvature at every point. Thus the surface is ''convex'' in the sense that the tangent plane at every point intersects the surface only in this point.\n\n== Parametric representations ==\n[[File:Cylinder - hyperboloid - cone.gif|thumb|Animation of a hyperboloid of revolution]]\nCartesian coordinates for the hyperboloids can be defined, similar to [[spherical coordinates]], keeping the [[azimuth]] angle {{math|''\u03b8'' \u2208 {{closed-open|0, 2''\u03c0''}}}}, but changing inclination {{math|''v''}} into [[hyperbolic trigonometric function]]s:\n\nOne-surface hyperboloid: {{math|''v'' \u2208 {{open-open|\u2212&infin;, &infin;}}}}\n:<math>\\begin{align} x&=a \\cosh v \\cos\\theta \\\\ y&=b \\cosh v \\sin\\theta \\\\ z&=c \\sinh v \\end{align}</math>\n\nTwo-surface hyperboloid: {{math|''v'' \u2208 {{closed-open|0, &infin;}}}}\n:<math>\\begin{align} x&=a \\sinh v \\cos\\theta \\\\ y&=b \\sinh v \\sin\\theta \\\\ z&=\\pm c \\cosh v \\end{align}</math>\n[[File:Hyperboloid-1s.svg|thumb|hyperboloid of one sheet: generation by a rotating hyperbola (top) and line (bottom: red or blue)]]\n[[File:Hyperbo-1s-cut-all.svg|thumb|hyperboloid of one sheet: plane sections]]\n\n== Properties of a hyperboloid of one sheet ==\n=== Lines on the surface ===\n*A hyperboloid of one sheet contains two pencils of lines. It is a [[doubly ruled surface]]. \nIf the hyperboloid has the equation\n<math> {x^2 \\over a^2} + {y^2 \\over b^2} - {z^2 \\over c^2}= 1</math>  then the lines\n\n:<math>g^{\\pm}_{\\alpha}:\n \\vec{x}(t)=\\begin{pmatrix} a\\cos\\alpha\\\\ b\\sin\\alpha\\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}\n  + t\\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} -a\\sin\\alpha\\\\ b\\cos\\alpha\\\\ \\pm c\\end{pmatrix}\\ ,\\quad t\\in \\R,\\ 0\\le \\alpha\\le 2\\pi\\  </math>\nare contained in the surface.\n\nIn case <math>a=b</math> the hyperboloid is a surface of revolution and can be generated by rotating one of the two lines <math>g^{+}_{0}</math> or <math>g^{-}_{0}</math>, which are skew to the rotation axis (see picture). This property is called ''[[Christopher Wren|Wren]]'s theorem''.<ref> K. Strubecker: ''Vorlesungen der Darstellenden Geometrie.'' Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, G\u00f6ttingen 1967, p. 218</ref> The more common generation of a one-sheet hyperboloid of revolution is rotating a [[hyperbola]] around its [[Semi-major and semi-minor axes#Hyperbola|semi-minor axis]] (see picture; rotating the hyperbola around its other axis gives a two-sheet hyperbola of revolution).\n\nA hyperboloid of one sheet is ''projectively'' equivalent to a [[hyperbolic paraboloid]].\n\n=== Plane sections ===\nFor simplicity the plane sections of the ''unit hyperboloid'' with equation <math> \\ H_1: x^2+y^2-z^2=1</math> are considered.

This is also true, but less obvious, in the general case (see [[circular section]]).\n\n''Remark:'' A hyperboloid of two sheets is ''projectively'' equivalent to a sphere.\n\n== Common parametric representation ==\nThe following parametric representation includes hyperboloids of one sheet, two sheets, and their common boundary cone, each with the <math>z</math>-axis as the axis of symmetry:\n\n<math>\\vec x(s,t)=\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{lll}\na \\sqrt{s^2+d} \\cos t\\\\\nb \\sqrt{s^2+d}  \\sin t\\\\\nc s\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n</math>\n\n*For <math>d>0</math> one obtains a hyperboloid of one sheet, \n*For <math>d<0</math> a hyperboloid of two sheets, and \n*For <math>d=0</math> a double cone.\n\nOne can obtain a parametric representation of a hyperboloid with a different coordinate axis as the axis of symmetry by shuffling the position of the <math>c s</math> term to the appropriate component in the equation above.\n\n== Symmetries of a hyperboloid ==\nThe hyperboloids with equations \n<math>\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} - \\frac{z^2}{c^2} = 1 , \\quad \\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} - \\frac{z^2}{c^2} = -1 \\ </math>\nare\n*''pointsymmetric'' to the origin,\n*''symmetric to the coordinate planes'' and\n*''rotational symmetric'' to the z-axis and symmetric to any plane containing the z-axis, in case of <math>a=b</math> (hyperboloid of revolution).\n\n== On the curvature of a hyperboloid ==\nWhereas the [[Gaussian curvature]] of a hyperboloid of one sheet is negative, that of a two-sheet hyperboloid is positive. In spite of its positive curvature, the hyperboloid of two sheets with another suitably chosen metric can also be used as a [[Hyperboloid model|model]] for hyperbolic geometry.\n\n==Generalised equations==\nMore generally, an arbitrarily oriented hyperboloid, centered at {{math|'''v'''}}, is defined by the equation\n:<math>(\\mathbf{x-v})^\\mathrm{T} A (\\mathbf{x-v}) = 1,</math>\nwhere {{math|''A''}} is a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] and {{math|'''x'''}}, {{math|'''v'''}} are [[euclidean vector|vectors]].\n\nThe [[eigenvector]]s of {{math|''A''}} define the principal directions of the hyperboloid and the [[eigenvalue]]s of A are the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]]s of the squares of the semi-axes: <math>{1/a^2}</math>, <math>{1/b^2}  </math> and <math>{1/c^2}</math>. The one-sheet hyperboloid has two positive eigenvalues and one negative eigenvalue. The two-sheet hyperboloid has one positive eigenvalue and two negative eigenvalues.\n\n==In more than three dimensions==\nImaginary hyperboloids are frequently found in mathematics of higher dimensions. For example, in a [[pseudo-Euclidean space]] one has the use of a [[quadratic form]]:\n: <math>q(x) = \\left(x_1^2+\\cdots + x_k^2\\right)-\\left(x_{k+1}^2+\\cdots + x_n^2\\right), \\quad k < n .</math> \nWhen {{math|''c''}} is any [[constant (mathematics)|constant]], then the part of the space given by\n:<math>\\lbrace x \\ :\\ q(x) = c \\rbrace </math>\nis called a ''hyperboloid''. The degenerate case corresponds to {{math|1=''c'' = 0}}.\n\nAs an example, consider the following passage:<ref>Thomas Hawkins (2000) ''Emergence of the Theory of Lie Groups: an essay in the history of mathematics, 1869\u20141926'', \u00a79.3 \"The Mathematization of Physics at G\u00f6ttingen\", see page 340, Springer {{ISBN|0-387-98963-3}}</ref>\n:... the velocity vectors always lie on a surface which Minkowski calls a four-dimensional hyperboloid since, expressed in terms of purely real coordinates {{math|(''y''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''y''<sub>4</sub>)}}, its equation is {{math|''y''{{su|b=1|p=2}} + ''y''{{su|b=2|p=2}} + ''y''{{su|b=3|p=2}} \u2212 ''y''{{su|b=4|p=2}} {{=}} \u22121}}, analogous to the hyperboloid {{math|''y''{{su|b=1|p=2}} + ''y''{{su|b=2|p=2}} \u2212 ''y''{{su|b=3|p=2}} {{=}} \u22121}} of three-dimensional space.{{refn|Minkowski used the term \"four-dimensional hyperboloid\" only once, in a posthumously-published typescript and this was non-standard usage, as Minkowski's hyperboloid is a three-dimensional submanifold of a four-dimensional Minkowski space <math>M^4.</math><ref>{{Citation|author=Walter, Scott A.|year=1999|contribution=The non-Euclidean style of Minkowskian relativity|editor=J.

It tells the story of a bored young boy named Milo who unexpectedly receives a magic [[toll road|tollbooth]] one afternoon and, having nothing better to do, drives through it in his toy car, transporting him to the Kingdom of Wisdom, once prosperous but now troubled. There, he acquires two faithful companions and goes on a quest to restore to the kingdom its exiled princesses\u2014named Rhyme and Reason\u2014from the Castle in the Air. In the process, he learns valuable lessons, finding a love of learning. The text is full of [[pun]]s and wordplay, such as when Milo unintentionally jumps to Conclusions, an island in Wisdom, thus exploring the literal meanings of [[idiom]]s.\n\nIn 1958, Juster had received a [[Ford Foundation]] grant for a children's book about cities. Unable to make progress on that project, he turned to writing what became ''The Phantom Tollbooth'', his first book. His housemate, Feiffer, a cartoonist, interested himself in the project. [[Jason Epstein]], an editor at Random House, bought the book and published it. The book received rave reviews and has sold in excess of three million copies, far more than expected. It has been adapted into [[The Phantom Tollbooth (film)|a film]], opera, and play, and translated into many languages.\n\nThough the [[book]] is on its face an [[adventure story]], a major theme is the need for a love of [[education]]; through this, Milo applies what he has learned in school, advances in his personal development, and learns to love the life that previously bored him. Critics have compared its appeal to that of [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and to [[L. Frank Baum]]'s ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Lands.beyond.jpg|thumb|right|Map drawn by [[Jules Feiffer]] to illustrate the book]]\n{{see also|List of The Phantom Tollbooth characters}}\nMilo is a boy bored by the world around him; every activity seems a waste of time.  He arrives home from another boring day at school to find a mysterious package. Among its contents are a small tollbooth and a map of \"the Lands Beyond,\" illustrating the Kingdom of Wisdom (which will also guide the reader from its place on the [[endpaper]]s of the book). Attached to the package is a note \"For Milo, who has plenty of time.\" Warned by an included sign to have his destination in mind, he decides without much thought to go to Dictionopolis, assuming this is a pretend game to be played on the floor of his room. He maneuvers through the tollbooth in his electric toy car, and instantly finds himself driving on a road that is clearly not in his city apartment.\n\nMilo begins with Expectations, a pleasant place where he starts on Wisdom's road. In Expectations, he seeks directions from the Whether Man, who is full of endless talk. As Milo drives on, he daydreams and gets lost in the [[Doldrums]], a colorless place where nothing ever happens. Milo soon joins the inhabitants, the Lethargians, in killing time there, a pastime angrily interrupted by the arrival of Tock, a talking, oversize dog with an alarm clock on each side (a \"watchdog\"), who tells Milo that only by thinking can he get out of the Doldrums. Head abuzz with unaccustomed thoughts, Milo is soon back on his road, and the watchdog joins him on his journey through Wisdom.\n\nMilo and Tock travel to Dictionopolis, one of two capital cities of the divided Kingdom of Wisdom, and home to King Azaz the Unabridged. They meet King Azaz's cabinet officials and visit the Word Market, where the words and letters are sold that empower the world. A fight between the Spelling Bee and the blustering [[Humbug]] breaks up the market, and Milo and Tock are arrested by the very short Officer Shrift. In prison, Milo meets the Which (not to be confused with Witch), also known as Faintly Macabre, long in charge of which words should be used in Wisdom.  She tells him how the two rulers, King Azaz and his brother, the Mathemagician, had two adopted younger sisters, Rhyme and Reason, to whom everyone came to settle disputes. All lived in harmony until the rulers disagreed with the princesses' decision that [[letter (alphabet)|letters]] (championed by Azaz) and [[number]]s (by the Mathemagician) were equally important. They banished the princesses to the Castle in the Air, and since then, the land has had neither Rhyme nor Reason.\n\nMilo and Tock leave the dungeon. King Azaz hosts them at a banquet where the guests literally eat their words, served to them on plates. After the meal, King Azaz lets Milo and Tock talk themselves into a dangerous quest to rescue the princesses. Azaz flatters the Humbug into being their guide, and boy, dog and insect set off for the Mathemagician's capital of Digitopolis as they must gain his approval before they can begin their quest.\n\nAlong the way, they meet such characters as Alec Bings, a little boy suspended in the air who sees through things and who will grow down until he reaches the ground. He then meets the world's smallest giant, the world's biggest dwarf, the world's thinnest fat man, and the world's fattest thin man, who turn out to just be one regular man. Milo then loses time in substituting for Chroma the Great, a conductor whose [[orchestra]] creates the colors of the world.\n\nThey meet a creature called the Dodecahedron, who leads them to Digitopolis, where they meet the Mathemagician, who is still angry at Azaz, and who will not give his blessing to anything that his brother has approved. Milo maneuvers him into saying he will permit the quest if the boy can show the two have concurred on anything since they banished the princesses. To the number wizard's shock, Milo proves that the two have agreed to disagree, and the Mathemagician gives his reluctant consent.\n\nIn the Mountains of Ignorance, the journeyers contend with demons like the Terrible Trivium and the Gelatinous Giant. After overcoming obstacles and their own fears, they reach the Castle in the Air. Princesses Rhyme and Reason welcome Milo and agree to return to Wisdom. Unable to enter the castle, the demons cut it loose, letting it drift away, but Milo realizes Tock can carry them down because time flies. The demons pursue, but the armies of Wisdom repel them. Rhyme and Reason heal the divisions in the old Kingdom of Wisdom, Azaz and the Mathemagician are reconciled, and all enjoy a three-day celebration.\n\nMilo says goodbye and drives back through the tollbooth. Suddenly he is back in his own room, and discovers he has been gone only an hour, though his journey seemed to take weeks. He awakens the next day with plans to return to the kingdom, but finds the tollbooth gone when he gets home from school. A note instead is there, \"For Milo, who now knows the way.\" The note states that the tollbooth is being sent to another child who needs help finding direction in life. Milo is somewhat disappointed but agrees and looks at a now-interesting world around him, concluding that even if he found a way back, he might not have time to go, for there is so much to do right where he is.\n\n==Writing==\nArchitect [[Norton Juster]] was living in his hometown of [[Brooklyn]], after three years in the [[United States Navy|Navy]].<ref name = \"npr\" /> In June 1960, he gained a $5,000 grant from the Ford Foundation to write a children's book about cities.<ref name=\"gopnik\"/> Juster argued that the young [[baby boomer]]s would soon have responsibility for the cities, and many lived in the suburbs and did not know them. In his proposal, he said he wanted \"to stimulate and heighten perception&nbsp;\u2013 to help children notice and appreciate the visual world around them&nbsp;\u2013 to help excite them and shape their interest in an environment they will eventually reshape.\"{{sfn|Juster and Marcus|p=ix}} Beginning with great enthusiasm, he ground to a halt with too many notes and too little progress.

Feiffer was surprised to learn that his friend's insomnia was not caused by the cities book, but by a book about a boy. Juster showed Feiffer the draft to date and, unbidden, the artist began sketching illustrations. Feiffer knew Judy Sheftel, who put deals together in the publishing trade and was his future bride. Sheftel got [[Jason Epstein]], an innovative editor at [[Random House]] with a deep appreciation for children's literature, to agree to review the manuscript.{{sfn|Juster and Marcus|pp=xxiii\u2013xxv}} Some at Random House considered the book's vocabulary too difficult: at the time, educators advised against children's literature containing words the target audience did not already know, fearing the unfamiliar would discourage young learners.<ref name = \"npr\" /> Based on seven chapters of manuscript, plus a three-page outline of the rest of the story, Epstein bought the book.{{sfn|Juster and Marcus|p=xxviii}}\n\n[[File:Jules Feiffer.jpg|thumb|left|Feiffer in 1958 with pictures from his first book]]\nSince Juster did the cooking for the housemates, if Feiffer wanted to eat, he had to do the drawings.{{sfn|Juster and Marcus|p=xxiv}} Feiffer quickly realized the book would require illustrations of the type and quality that [[John Tenniel]] had created for [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and although a nationally known artist, doubted his competence to do the text justice.{{sfn|Juster and Marcus|pp=xxxii\u2013xxxiii}} Feiffer considers the double-spread illustration of demons late in the book to be a success and one of his favorites. It differs from his usual style (which would involve a white background), and instead uses [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]]'s drawings as an inspiration.{{sfn|Juster and Marcus|p=240}}\n\nIt became a game, with Feiffer trying to draw things the way he wanted, and Juster trying to describe things that were impossible to sketch.{{sfn|Juster and Marcus|p=xxxiii}} These included the Triple Demons of Compromise\u2014one short and fat, one tall and thin, and the third exactly like the first two.<ref name = \"indy\">{{cite news|last=Hahn|first=Daniel|title=The Curious World of Norton Juster|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/the-curious-world-of-norton-juster-7768624.html|date=May 19, 2012|accessdate=February 18, 2016|newspaper=[[The Independent]]}}</ref> Feiffer got his revenge by depicting the author as the Whether Man, clad in a toga.{{sfn|Juster and Marcus|p=18}}\n\nRepeated edits altered the protagonist's name (originally Tony), removed his parents entirely from the book, and deleted text attempting to describe how the tollbooth package had been delivered.

Why, we fought in the crusades with Richard the Lion Heart, crossed the Atlantic with Columbus, blazed trails with the pioneers, and today many members of the family hold important government positions throughout the world.  History is full of Humbugs.\"\n| source = ''The Phantom Tollbooth'' (in Dictionopolis) {{sfn|Juster and Marcus|p=54}}}}\nAnother theme is the need for common sense to back up rules.  Milo journeys through a land where, without Rhyme or Reason, the art of governance has been lost, leading to bizarre results.  Milo repeatedly meets characters to whom words are more important than their meaning.  The Whether Man, for all his talk, is unable to provide Milo with the information or guidance the boy wants, while Officer Shrift's investigation of the overturning of the Word Market contains the forms of law, without justice. The denizens around Digitopolis are little better; the twelve-faced [[regular dodecahedron|Dodecahedron]], named for what he is, turns the logic of his naming on its head when he asks if everyone with one face is called Milo. The attitudes now displayed by the adherents of both brothers are summed up by the Dodecahedron, \"as long as the answer is right, who cares if the question is wrong?\"{{sfn|Liston|pp=58\u201359}}\n\nAs Milo struggles with words and begins the process of making himself their master, he also has difficulty with numbers, especially when he speaks with .58 of a child, who with parents and two siblings (whom Milo does not meet) makes up an average family. Milo has had difficulties in school with mathematics and problem solving; his reaction to this encounter is to protest that averages are not real.  The partial child enlightens Milo that there is beauty in math beyond the tedium of learning an endless set of rules, \"one of the nicest things about mathematics, or anything else you might care to learn, is that many of the things which can never be, often are\".<ref name = \"brown\" />{{sfn|Juster and Marcus|p=197}} Late in the book, Princess Reason counsels Milo, who has much learning ahead of him, not to be discouraged by its complexity, \"You must never feel badly about making mistakes&nbsp;... as long as you take the trouble to learn from them. For you often learn more by being wrong for the right reasons than you do by being right for the wrong reasons\".<ref name = \"brown\" />{{sfn|Juster and Marcus|p=233}} An index card in the Juster papers sets forth the germ of the princess' \"memorable\" counsel to Milo, \"Quite often the road to Rhyme + Reason is through the right mistakes.\"{{sfn|Juster and Marcus|p=233}}\n\nAlthough Milo is bored with learning, that does not mean he knew nothing before his journey.  He exhibits characteristics of a well-schooled child of his time; his speech is polite and peppered with \"please\" and \"thank you\", and when he unexpectedly encounters the partial child, he requests pardon for staring.<ref name = \"brown\" /> He can count to a thousand, though his tact in bringing up the subject in the presence of the numbers-hating King Azaz is not the best. Mindful of his mother's admonition to eat lightly when a guest, he initially orders a light meal at the banquet, only to find the waiters bringing in insubstantial light beams. Not realizing he will be asked to eat his words, he then makes a plausible start at a speech before being interrupted by the king.{{sfn|Juster and Marcus|pp=86\u201387}}\n''The Phantom Tollbooth'' displays Milo's growth; Leonard S. Marcus in his notes to its annotated edition writes that the boy learns to think in the abstract, pledging after his unintentional jump to Conclusions that he will not make up his mind again without a good reason.  Milo does not accept the word of the demon of insincerity<!-- lower case in book --> that he is a threat and is rewarded by learning he is not.{{sfn|Juster and Marcus|pp=170, 216}} Just for a moment, Milo is able to float in the air beside Alec Bings and see things from the perspective he will have as an adult, allowing the young reader to contemplate what it will be like to do the same.<ref name = \"brown\" /> According to Liston, Milo \"transforms himself from an unthinking and compliant Lethargarian to a young adult with greater consciousness, a firmer sense of self, and a newly found set of responsibilities\".{{sfn|Liston|p=62}}\n\nEven though the day is won by Milo and his fellow questers, it is a great but not a permanent victory, as he hears the kingly brothers begin to argue again as he departs.  Juster has written that it was his intent to get Milo out of there as quickly as possible, and that \"the fight would have to be won again and again\".{{sfn|Juster and Marcus|p=252}}\n\nMilo's trip through the lands beyond the tollbooth teaches the previously bored child to appreciate both journey and destination. This is a lesson that had been unlearned by the citizens of Wisdom, as exemplified by the described fate of the twin cities of Reality and Illusions. Although the city of Illusions never actually existed, Reality was lost as its residents concentrated on getting to their destination as quickly as possible, and, unappreciated, the city withered away, unnoticed by the busy people who still hasten along its former streets. Milo meets his trials by defining himself as different from the kingdom's inhabitants, who either demand or accept conformity, as enforced by the kingdom's laws, which discourage (and even outlaw) thought. Milo cannot accept such laws, beginning when, in the Doldrums, he thinks, thus violating a local ordinance and separating himself from the thoughtless inhabitants. Liston opined that because the Kingdom of Wisdom's \"laws require the impossible, they contradict what it means to be fully human\".{{sfn|Liston|pp=60\u201361}}{{sfn|Juster and Marcus|p=24}}\n\n==Influences and comparisons==\n''The Phantom Tollbooth'' contains allusions to many works, including those loved by Juster in his own upbringing. Some of Juster's favorite books as a child, including ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'', had endpaper maps; Juster insisted on one, over Feiffer's opposition, going so far as to sketch one and require that his collaborator reproduce it in his own style.{{sfn|Juster and Marcus|p=13}} Juster was also inspired by his father Samuel's love of [[pun]]s, with which the book is more than sprinkled. In his childhood, Juster spent much time listening to the radio.<ref name = \"eleven\" /> According to Juster, the need to envision the action when listening to [[radio serial]]s helped inspire ''The Phantom Tollbooth'', as well as yielding the character of Tock, based on [[sidekick]] Jim Fairfield from ''[[Jack Armstrong, the All-American Boy]]''. Jim gave Tock his wisdom, courage, and adventurous spirit.<ref name = \"eleven\" /> As a child, Juster had [[synesthesia]], and could only do arithmetic by making associations between numbers and colors. He remembered that the condition affected word associations. \"One of the things I always did was think literally when I heard words. On the ''[[Lone Ranger]]'' [radio serial] they would say, 'Here come the Injuns!' and I always had an image of engines, of train engines.\"<ref name = \"gopnik\" />\n\n{{quote box | align = right | width = 25em | salign = right\n| quote =  \"Oh dear, all those words again,\" thought Milo as he climbed into the wagon with Tock and the cabinet members. \"How are you going to make it move? It doesn't have a\u2014\"<br>\n\"Be very quiet,\" advised the duke, \"for it goes without saying.\"<br>\nAnd, sure enough, as soon as they were all quite still, it began to move through the streets, and in a very short time they arrived at the royal palace.\n| source = ''The Phantom Tollbooth'' (in Dictionopolis) {{sfn|Juster and Marcus|p=79}}}}\nSome of the incidents in the book stem from Juster's own past.  In Digitopolis, the Numbers Mine, where gemlike numerals are dug for, recalled one of Juster's architecture professors at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], who compared numbers and equations to jewels.{{sfn|Juster and Marcus|p=177}} The [[Marx Brothers]] films were a staple for Juster as a child and his father would quote lengthy passages from the movies;{{sfn|Juster and Marcus|p=xii}} this inspired the unending series of straight-faced puns that fills the book.<ref name = \"indy\" />\n\nGrowing up in a [[Jewish-American]] household where the parents demanded high achievement, Juster was intimately familiar with expectations, though in his case many of his parents' hopes were centered on his older brother, an academic star.{{sfn|Juster and Marcus|p=17}} The Terrible Trivium, the well-dressed, polite demon who sets the questers to mindless tasks, was Juster's way of representing his own tendency to avoid what he should be doing in favor of a more congenial occupation, such as his evasion of the grant project to write ''The Phantom Tollbooth''.{{sfn|Juster and Marcus|p= 208}} Juster drew on Feiffer's life experiences as well; the Whether Man's adage \"Expect everything, I always say, and the unexpected never happens\" was a favorite of the cartoonist's mother.{{sfn|Juster and Marcus|p=20}}\n\nJuster had not read ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' when he wrote ''The Phantom Tollbooth'', but the two books, each about a bored child plunged into a world of absurd logic, have repeatedly been compared.<ref name = \"indy\" /><ref name = \"brown\" /> According to Daniel Hahn in his 2012 article on the Juster book, \"Alice is clearly Milo's closest literary kin\".<ref name = \"indy\" /> Milo's conversation with the Whether Man, which leaves him no more comprehending than when he came, recalls that of Alice with the [[Cheshire Cat]].{{sfn|Juster and Marcus|p=18}} The questions of authority (something omnipresent for a child) and of justice run through both books; the [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Queen of Hearts']] arbitrary justice is echoed, though with less violence, by Officer Shrift.<ref name = \"brown\" /> Alice's sovereigns, representing the authority figures of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] childhood life, rule absolutely (though not necessarily effectively); a child of the post-[[World War II]] world, Milo journeys through a more bureaucratic realm.{{sfn|Liston|p=62}} His quest is far more purposeful than the frustrating journey Alice experiences, and the outcome differs as well\u2014Milo restores his kingdom while Alice overturns hers. Carroll leaves us uncertain if Alice has learned anything from her adventures, but Juster makes it clear that Milo has acquired tools he will need to find his way through life.<ref name = \"brown\" />\n\n==Publication and reception==\n''The Phantom Tollbooth'' was published in September 1961. Its competition among new books for the minds and hearts of children included [[Roald Dahl]]'s ''[[James and the Giant Peach]]''. ''[[The Bronze Bow]]'', set in the Biblical times, was newly available, and would bring [[Elizabeth George Speare]] her second [[Newbery Award]] in three years. Neither publisher nor first-time author expected many sales for ''The Phantom Tollbooth'', but Juster was nevertheless disappointed not to find his work on store shelves.

It tells the story of a bored young boy named Milo who unexpectedly receives a magic [[toll road|tollbooth]] one afternoon and, having nothing better to do, drives through it in his toy car, transporting him to the Kingdom of Wisdom, once prosperous but now troubled. There, he acquires two faithful companions and goes on a quest to restore to the kingdom its exiled princesses\u2014named Rhyme and Reason\u2014from the Castle in the Air. In the process, he learns valuable lessons, finding a love of learning. The text is full of [[pun]]s and wordplay, such as when Milo unintentionally jumps to Conclusions, an island in Wisdom, thus exploring the literal meanings of [[idiom]]s.\n\nIn 1958, Juster had received a [[Ford Foundation]] grant for a children's book about cities. Unable to make progress on that project, he turned to writing what became ''The Phantom Tollbooth'', his first book. His housemate, Feiffer, a cartoonist, interested himself in the project. [[Jason Epstein]], an editor at Random House, bought the book and published it. The book received rave reviews and has sold in excess of three million copies, far more than expected. It has been adapted into [[The Phantom Tollbooth (film)|a film]], opera, and play, and translated into many languages.\n\nThough the [[book]] is on its face an [[adventure story]], a major theme is the need for a love of [[education]]; through this, Milo applies what he has learned in school, advances in his personal development, and learns to love the life that previously bored him. Critics have compared its appeal to that of [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and to [[L. Frank Baum]]'s ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Lands.beyond.jpg|thumb|right|Map drawn by [[Jules Feiffer]] to illustrate the book]]\n{{see also|List of The Phantom Tollbooth characters}}\nMilo is a boy bored by the world around him; every activity seems a waste of time.  He arrives home from another boring day at school to find a mysterious package. Among its contents are a small tollbooth and a map of \"the Lands Beyond,\" illustrating the Kingdom of Wisdom (which will also guide the reader from its place on the [[endpaper]]s of the book). Attached to the package is a note \"For Milo, who has plenty of time.\" Warned by an included sign to have his destination in mind, he decides without much thought to go to Dictionopolis, assuming this is a pretend game to be played on the floor of his room. He maneuvers through the tollbooth in his electric toy car, and instantly finds himself driving on a road that is clearly not in his city apartment.\n\nMilo begins with Expectations, a pleasant place where he starts on Wisdom's road. In Expectations, he seeks directions from the Whether Man, who is full of endless talk. As Milo drives on, he daydreams and gets lost in the [[Doldrums]], a colorless place where nothing ever happens. Milo soon joins the inhabitants, the Lethargians, in killing time there, a pastime angrily interrupted by the arrival of Tock, a talking, oversize dog with an alarm clock on each side (a \"watchdog\"), who tells Milo that only by thinking can he get out of the Doldrums. Head abuzz with unaccustomed thoughts, Milo is soon back on his road, and the watchdog joins him on his journey through Wisdom.\n\nMilo and Tock travel to Dictionopolis, one of two capital cities of the divided Kingdom of Wisdom, and home to King Azaz the Unabridged. They meet King Azaz's cabinet officials and visit the Word Market, where the words and letters are sold that empower the world. A fight between the Spelling Bee and the blustering [[Humbug]] breaks up the market, and Milo and Tock are arrested by the very short Officer Shrift. In prison, Milo meets the Which (not to be confused with Witch), also known as Faintly Macabre, long in charge of which words should be used in Wisdom.  She tells him how the two rulers, King Azaz and his brother, the Mathemagician, had two adopted younger sisters, Rhyme and Reason, to whom everyone came to settle disputes. All lived in harmony until the rulers disagreed with the princesses' decision that [[letter (alphabet)|letters]] (championed by Azaz) and [[number]]s (by the Mathemagician) were equally important. They banished the princesses to the Castle in the Air, and since then, the land has had neither Rhyme nor Reason.\n\nMilo and Tock leave the dungeon. King Azaz hosts them at a banquet where the guests literally eat their words, served to them on plates. After the meal, King Azaz lets Milo and Tock talk themselves into a dangerous quest to rescue the princesses. Azaz flatters the Humbug into being their guide, and boy, dog and insect set off for the Mathemagician's capital of Digitopolis as they must gain his approval before they can begin their quest.\n\nAlong the way, they meet such characters as Alec Bings, a little boy suspended in the air who sees through things and who will grow down until he reaches the ground. He then meets the world's smallest giant, the world's biggest dwarf, the world's thinnest fat man, and the world's fattest thin man, who turn out to just be one regular man. Milo then loses time in substituting for Chroma the Great, a conductor whose [[orchestra]] creates the colors of the world.\n\nThey meet a creature called the Dodecahedron, who leads them to Digitopolis, where they meet the Mathemagician, who is still angry at Azaz, and who will not give his blessing to anything that his brother has approved. Milo maneuvers him into saying he will permit the quest if the boy can show the two have concurred on anything since they banished the princesses. To the number wizard's shock, Milo proves that the two have agreed to disagree, and the Mathemagician gives his reluctant consent.\n\nIn the Mountains of Ignorance, the journeyers contend with demons like the Terrible Trivium and the Gelatinous Giant. After overcoming obstacles and their own fears, they reach the Castle in the Air. Princesses Rhyme and Reason welcome Milo and agree to return to Wisdom. Unable to enter the castle, the demons cut it loose, letting it drift away, but Milo realizes Tock can carry them down because time flies. The demons pursue, but the armies of Wisdom repel them. Rhyme and Reason heal the divisions in the old Kingdom of Wisdom, Azaz and the Mathemagician are reconciled, and all enjoy a three-day celebration.\n\nMilo says goodbye and drives back through the tollbooth. Suddenly he is back in his own room, and discovers he has been gone only an hour, though his journey seemed to take weeks. He awakens the next day with plans to return to the kingdom, but finds the tollbooth gone when he gets home from school. A note instead is there, \"For Milo, who now knows the way.\" The note states that the tollbooth is being sent to another child who needs help finding direction in life.

Feiffer was surprised to learn that his friend's insomnia was not caused by the cities book, but by a book about a boy. Juster showed Feiffer the draft to date and, unbidden, the artist began sketching illustrations. Feiffer knew Judy Sheftel, who put deals together in the publishing trade and was his future bride.

History is full of Humbugs.\"\n| source = ''The Phantom Tollbooth'' (in Dictionopolis) {{sfn|Juster and Marcus|p=54}}}}\nAnother theme is the need for common sense to back up rules.  Milo journeys through a land where, without Rhyme or Reason, the art of governance has been lost, leading to bizarre results.  Milo repeatedly meets characters to whom words are more important than their meaning.  The Whether Man, for all his talk, is unable to provide Milo with the information or guidance the boy wants, while Officer Shrift's investigation of the overturning of the Word Market contains the forms of law, without justice. The denizens around Digitopolis are little better; the twelve-faced [[regular dodecahedron|Dodecahedron]], named for what he is, turns the logic of his naming on its head when he asks if everyone with one face is called Milo. The attitudes now displayed by the adherents of both brothers are summed up by the Dodecahedron, \"as long as the answer is right, who cares if the question is wrong?\"{{sfn|Liston|pp=58\u201359}}\n\nAs Milo struggles with words and begins the process of making himself their master, he also has difficulty with numbers, especially when he speaks with .58 of a child, who with parents and two siblings (whom Milo does not meet) makes up an average family. Milo has had difficulties in school with mathematics and problem solving; his reaction to this encounter is to protest that averages are not real.  The partial child enlightens Milo that there is beauty in math beyond the tedium of learning an endless set of rules, \"one of the nicest things about mathematics, or anything else you might care to learn, is that many of the things which can never be, often are\".<ref name = \"brown\" />{{sfn|Juster and Marcus|p=197}} Late in the book, Princess Reason counsels Milo, who has much learning ahead of him, not to be discouraged by its complexity, \"You must never feel badly about making mistakes&nbsp;... as long as you take the trouble to learn from them. For you often learn more by being wrong for the right reasons than you do by being right for the wrong reasons\".<ref name = \"brown\" />{{sfn|Juster and Marcus|p=233}} An index card in the Juster papers sets forth the germ of the princess' \"memorable\" counsel to Milo, \"Quite often the road to Rhyme + Reason is through the right mistakes.\"{{sfn|Juster and Marcus|p=233}}\n\nAlthough Milo is bored with learning, that does not mean he knew nothing before his journey.  He exhibits characteristics of a well-schooled child of his time; his speech is polite and peppered with \"please\" and \"thank you\", and when he unexpectedly encounters the partial child, he requests pardon for staring.<ref name = \"brown\" /> He can count to a thousand, though his tact in bringing up the subject in the presence of the numbers-hating King Azaz is not the best. Mindful of his mother's admonition to eat lightly when a guest, he initially orders a light meal at the banquet, only to find the waiters bringing in insubstantial light beams. Not realizing he will be asked to eat his words, he then makes a plausible start at a speech before being interrupted by the king.{{sfn|Juster and Marcus|pp=86\u201387}}\n''The Phantom Tollbooth'' displays Milo's growth; Leonard S. Marcus in his notes to its annotated edition writes that the boy learns to think in the abstract, pledging after his unintentional jump to Conclusions that he will not make up his mind again without a good reason.  Milo does not accept the word of the demon of insincerity<!-- lower case in book --> that he is a threat and is rewarded by learning he is not.{{sfn|Juster and Marcus|pp=170, 216}} Just for a moment, Milo is able to float in the air beside Alec Bings and see things from the perspective he will have as an adult, allowing the young reader to contemplate what it will be like to do the same.<ref name = \"brown\" /> According to Liston, Milo \"transforms himself from an unthinking and compliant Lethargarian to a young adult with greater consciousness, a firmer sense of self, and a newly found set of responsibilities\".{{sfn|Liston|p=62}}\n\nEven though the day is won by Milo and his fellow questers, it is a great but not a permanent victory, as he hears the kingly brothers begin to argue again as he departs.  Juster has written that it was his intent to get Milo out of there as quickly as possible, and that \"the fight would have to be won again and again\".{{sfn|Juster and Marcus|p=252}}\n\nMilo's trip through the lands beyond the tollbooth teaches the previously bored child to appreciate both journey and destination. This is a lesson that had been unlearned by the citizens of Wisdom, as exemplified by the described fate of the twin cities of Reality and Illusions. Although the city of Illusions never actually existed, Reality was lost as its residents concentrated on getting to their destination as quickly as possible, and, unappreciated, the city withered away, unnoticed by the busy people who still hasten along its former streets. Milo meets his trials by defining himself as different from the kingdom's inhabitants, who either demand or accept conformity, as enforced by the kingdom's laws, which discourage (and even outlaw) thought. Milo cannot accept such laws, beginning when, in the Doldrums, he thinks, thus violating a local ordinance and separating himself from the thoughtless inhabitants. Liston opined that because the Kingdom of Wisdom's \"laws require the impossible, they contradict what it means to be fully human\".{{sfn|Liston|pp=60\u201361}}{{sfn|Juster and Marcus|p=24}}\n\n==Influences and comparisons==\n''The Phantom Tollbooth'' contains allusions to many works, including those loved by Juster in his own upbringing. Some of Juster's favorite books as a child, including ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'', had endpaper maps; Juster insisted on one, over Feiffer's opposition, going so far as to sketch one and require that his collaborator reproduce it in his own style.{{sfn|Juster and Marcus|p=13}} Juster was also inspired by his father Samuel's love of [[pun]]s, with which the book is more than sprinkled. In his childhood, Juster spent much time listening to the radio.<ref name = \"eleven\" /> According to Juster, the need to envision the action when listening to [[radio serial]]s helped inspire ''The Phantom Tollbooth'', as well as yielding the character of Tock, based on [[sidekick]] Jim Fairfield from ''[[Jack Armstrong, the All-American Boy]]''. Jim gave Tock his wisdom, courage, and adventurous spirit.<ref name = \"eleven\" /> As a child, Juster had [[synesthesia]], and could only do arithmetic by making associations between numbers and colors. He remembered that the condition affected word associations. \"One of the things I always did was think literally when I heard words. On the ''[[Lone Ranger]]'' [radio serial] they would say, 'Here come the Injuns!' and I always had an image of engines, of train engines.\"<ref name = \"gopnik\" />\n\n{{quote box | align = right | width = 25em | salign = right\n| quote =  \"Oh dear, all those words again,\" thought Milo as he climbed into the wagon with Tock and the cabinet members. \"How are you going to make it move?

In Digitopolis, the Numbers Mine, where gemlike numerals are dug for, recalled one of Juster's architecture professors at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], who compared numbers and equations to jewels.{{sfn|Juster and Marcus|p=177}} The [[Marx Brothers]] films were a staple for Juster as a child and his father would quote lengthy passages from the movies;{{sfn|Juster and Marcus|p=xii}} this inspired the unending series of straight-faced puns that fills the book.<ref name = \"indy\" />\n\nGrowing up in a [[Jewish-American]] household where the parents demanded high achievement, Juster was intimately familiar with expectations, though in his case many of his parents' hopes were centered on his older brother, an academic star.{{sfn|Juster and Marcus|p=17}} The Terrible Trivium, the well-dressed, polite demon who sets the questers to mindless tasks, was Juster's way of representing his own tendency to avoid what he should be doing in favor of a more congenial occupation, such as his evasion of the grant project to write ''The Phantom Tollbooth''.{{sfn|Juster and Marcus|p= 208}} Juster drew on Feiffer's life experiences as well; the Whether Man's adage \"Expect everything, I always say, and the unexpected never happens\" was a favorite of the cartoonist's mother.{{sfn|Juster and Marcus|p=20}}\n\nJuster had not read ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' when he wrote ''The Phantom Tollbooth'', but the two books, each about a bored child plunged into a world of absurd logic, have repeatedly been compared.<ref name = \"indy\" /><ref name = \"brown\" /> According to Daniel Hahn in his 2012 article on the Juster book, \"Alice is clearly Milo's closest literary kin\".<ref name = \"indy\" /> Milo's conversation with the Whether Man, which leaves him no more comprehending than when he came, recalls that of Alice with the [[Cheshire Cat]].{{sfn|Juster and Marcus|p=18}} The questions of authority (something omnipresent for a child) and of justice run through both books; the [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Queen of Hearts']] arbitrary justice is echoed, though with less violence, by Officer Shrift.<ref name = \"brown\" /> Alice's sovereigns, representing the authority figures of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] childhood life, rule absolutely (though not necessarily effectively); a child of the post-[[World War II]] world, Milo journeys through a more bureaucratic realm.{{sfn|Liston|p=62}} His quest is far more purposeful than the frustrating journey Alice experiences, and the outcome differs as well\u2014Milo restores his kingdom while Alice overturns hers.

Its competition among new books for the minds and hearts of children included [[Roald Dahl]]'s ''[[James and the Giant Peach]]''. ''[[The Bronze Bow]]'', set in the Biblical times, was newly available, and would bring [[Elizabeth George Speare]] her second [[Newbery Award]] in three years. Neither publisher nor first-time author expected many sales for ''The Phantom Tollbooth'', but Juster was nevertheless disappointed not to find his work on store shelves.

They are usually raced on [[kart circuit|scaled-down circuits]], although some professional kart races are also held on full-size motorsport circuits. Karting is commonly perceived as the stepping stone to the higher ranks of motorsports, with former [[Formula One]] champions such as [[Sebastian Vettel]], [[Nico Rosberg]], [[Ayrton Senna]], [[Lewis Hamilton]], [[Michael Schumacher]] and [[Fernando Alonso]] having begun their careers in karting.\n\nKarts vary widely in speed and some (known as [[superkart]]s) can reach speeds exceeding {{convert|260|km/h|mph}}, while recreational go-karts intended for the general public may be limited to lower speeds.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Photography by Victor Albert Grigas (1919-2017)00025 sept 62 (37295972680).jpg|thumb|right|Kart racing in [[Illinois]] in 1962]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B1007-0016-001, 5.

Its first engine, the McCulloch MC-10,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://macbobaust.com/kart_engines.html |title=The McCulloch Kart Engines |publisher=Macbobaust.com |date=2002-09-15 |accessdate=2011-08-08}}</ref> was an adapted [[chainsaw]] [[two-stroke engine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vintagekarts.com/mcstory.htm |title=1959 \u2013 McCulloch's Entry into Kart Racing |publisher=Vintagekarts.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-08}}</ref> Later, in the 1960s, [[motorcycle]] engines were also adapted for kart use, before dedicated manufacturers, especially in Italy ([[Italian American Motor Engineering|IAME]]), started to build engines for the sport.\n\n== Components ==\n\n=== Chassis ===\nThe [[chassis]] are made of chrome moly tubing.<ref>[http://www.haase.it/download/Haase26-CH-11.pdf Example of a CIK-FIA homologation form] \u2013 Chassis, 2005</ref><ref name=\"chassis\">[http://www.cometkartsales.com/store/chassis/cpa/images/margayparts/margay17top.jpg Technical picture of a racing chassis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411105033/http://www.cometkartsales.com/store/chassis/cpa/images/margayparts/margay17top.jpg |date=11 April 2008 }} \u2013 [[Margay Products Inc.|Margay]] chassis</ref> There is no [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] so chassis have to be flexible enough to work as a suspension and stiff enough not to break or give way on a turn. Kart chassis are classified in the United States as 'Open', 'Caged', 'Straight' or 'Offset'. All [[Commission Internationale de Karting]] - [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile]] or CIK-FIA approved chassis are 'Straight' and 'Open'.\n\n*Open karts have no roll cage.\n*Caged karts have a [[roll cage]] surrounding the driver; they are mostly used on dirt tracks.\n*In Straight chassis the driver sits in the center. Straight chassis are used for [[Kart racing#Sprint|sprint racing]].\n*In Offset chassis the driver sits on the left side. Offset chassis are used for left-turn-only [[Oval track|speedway]] racing.\n\nThe stiffness of the chassis enables different handling characteristics for different circumstances. Typically, for dry conditions a stiffer chassis is preferable, while in wet or other poor traction conditions, a more flexible chassis may work better. Temperature of the track can also affect handling and may prompt additional chassis adjustments. The best chassis allow for stiffening bars at the rear, front and side to be added or removed according to race conditions.<ref>https://www.kartpartsdepot.com/product_p/007.htm</ref>\n\nBraking is achieved by a [[disc brake]] mounted on the rear axle. Front disc brakes are used in most shifter kart classes and are increasingly popular in other classes; however, certain classes do not allow them. Shifter karts have dual master cylinders, one for the front and one for the rear and are adjustable to allow for front/rear bias changes.\n\nProfessionally raced karts typically weigh {{convert|165|to|175|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, complete without driver. [[Avanti Kart|Avanti]], [[Tony Kart]], [[Jarno Trulli|Trulli]], [[Birel]], [[CRG (kart manufacturer)|CRG]], [[Gillard (kart manufacturer)|Gillard]], [[Intrepid Kart|Intrepid]], [[Kosmic Kart|Kosmic]], [[Alex Zanardi|Zanardi]] or [[Fernando Alonso|FA Kart]] and [[EKS Motorsport|EKS]] are a few well known examples of the many European manufacturers of race-quality chassis. Emmick, Coyote, Bandit, Shadow, MGM, Titan, PRC and [[Margay Products Inc.|Margay]] are American companies producing kart chassis.\n\n=== Engines ===\n[[File:Shifter_Kart_Engine.jpg|thumb|Shifter kart engine]]\nAmusement park [[go-kart]]s can be powered by four-stroke [[Internal combustion engine|engines]] or [[electric motor]]s, while racing karts use small two-stroke or four-stroke engines.\n\n* [[Four-stroke engine]]s can be standard air-cooled industrial based engines, sometimes with small modifications, developing from about 5 to 20&nbsp;hp. [[Briggs & Stratton]], Tecumseh, Kohler, Robin, and [[Honda]] are manufacturers of such engines. They are adequate for racing and fun kart applications. There are also more powerful four-stroke engines available from manufacturers like [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]], TKM, [[Swissauto]] or Aixro ([[Wankel engine]]) offering from 15&nbsp;hp up to 48&nbsp;hp. They run to and around 11,000 rpm, and are manufactured specifically for karting. Those are used in some National Championship classes like the two-strokes.\n* [[Two-stroke engine|Two-stroke]] kart engines are developed and built by dedicated manufacturers. WTP, Comer, [[Italian American Motor Engineering|IAME]] (Parilla, Komet, Woltjer), TM, Vortex, Titan, REFO, Modena Engines, TKM, [[PRD Fireball|PRD]], [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]] and [[Rotax]] are manufacturers of such engines. These can develop from about 8&nbsp;hp for a single-cylinder 60 cc unit (MiniROK by Vortex) to over 90&nbsp;hp for a twin 250 cc.<<ref name=\"Superkart\">{{cite web|url=http://www.parcferme.com/content/view/2663/2/ |title=Superkart at Magny-Cours \u2013 2007 |publisher=Parcferme.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-08}}</ref> Today, the most popular categories worldwide are those using the TaG 125 cc units.

This is achieved by designing the chassis so that the inside rear tire lifts up slightly when the kart turns the corner. This allows the tire to lose some of its grip and slide or lift off the ground completely.\n\nPower is transmitted from the engine to the rear axle by a chain. Both engine and axle [[sprockets]] are removable. Their ratio must be adapted to the track configuration to obtain the most performance from the engine.\n\nIn the early days, karts were direct drive (requiring push starts). The inconvenience of that configuration led to the [[centrifugal clutch]] for the club level classes. Dry centrifugal clutches are now used in many categories ([[Rotax Max]] is one example) and have become the norm as the top international classes have switched to 125&nbsp;cc clutched engines as of January 2007.\n\n=== Tires ===\nWheels and [[tire]]s are much smaller than those used on a normal car. Rims are made of [[magnesium]] alloy, [[aluminum]], or [[composite material]]s. Tires can support cornering forces in excess of 2 [[Gravity of Earth|g]] (20&nbsp;m/s\u00b2), depending on chassis, engine, and motor [[Racing setup|setup]]. Some car tire manufacturers, such as [[Bridgestone]], [[Dunlop Tyres|Dunlop]], and [[Maxxis]] make tires for karts. There are also specific kart tire manufacturers, which include MG, MOJO, Vega, Hoosier and Burris.\n\nSimilar to other motorsports, kart tires have different types for use appropriate to track conditions:\n* [[Slick tire|Slicks]], for dry track. Slick kart tires come in many different compounds, from very soft (maximum grip) to very hard (amusement and rental karts, less grip but long life span). In international level racing, because the drivers are free to choose their tires<ref>[http://www.cikfiachampionship.com/news.asp?id=77 Latest decisions of the FIA World Motor Sport Council concerning Karting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140926005547/http://www.cikfiachampionship.com/news.asp?id=77 |date=26 September 2014 }} - CIK-FIA, 15 March 2012</ref> and because of the short duration of each round (10 to 20 minutes  maximum), these are some of the softest tires found in motorsport.\n* [[Rain tire]]s, or \"wets\", for wet weather. They are grooved, made of soft compound, and are narrower than slicks. Not all racing classes allow rain tires.\n* Special, such as spiked tires for icy conditions, or \"cuts/grooved\" for high grip dirt/clay speedways. Cuts are slicks modified with a [[lathe]] to optimize handling. Tire manufacturers such as Hoosier and Burris also make a slightly larger grooved tire only used in dirt track racing.\n\n=== Data acquisition ===\n\nAs in other motor sports, several data acquisition systems have been developed for kart racing. These systems allow the driver to monitor from a display fixed on the steering wheel some parameters such as RPM, timing of laps (including sectors), number of laps, best lap, cooling system temperature, exhaust gas temperature and sometimes speed or even gear for shifter karts.\n\nSome of those systems are able to record (logging) laps data from the sensors, allowing replay of an entire running session or/and direct download to a personal computer equipped with a data analysis software. More sophisticated systems allow for more information such as lateral and longitudinal acceleration ([[g-force]]), throttle position, steering wheel position and brake pressure.\n\n== Racing ==\n[[File:KartingNSKC.jpg|thumb|Sprint race at Eastern Creek, Australia]]\n[[File:Rotax Max1.jpg|thumb|Maximilien Blank and his team-mate Jason Trulo (sprint)]]\nKart racing is generally accepted as the most economic form of [[motorsport]] available on four wheels. As a free-time activity, it can be performed by almost anybody, and as a motorsport in itself, it is one of the sports regulated by [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] (under the name of [[Commission Internationale de Karting|CIK]]), permitting licensed racing for anyone from the age of 8 onward.\n\nIn the United States, there is not as much FIA involvement; instead, many organizations regulate racing, such as the IKF ([[International Kart Federation]]), WKA ([[World Karting Association]]), KART (Karters of America Racing Triad), USPKS (United States Pro Karting Series).\n\nIn the UK, the [[Motor Sports Association]] (MSA) regulates most 'owner driver' Karting. Some associations, such as [[Natska|NatSKA]] (National Schools Karting Association), organize race meetings throughout the country under the authority of the MSA.\nVarious four-stroke 'hire kart' series such as EPEC (European Prokart Endurance Championship)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.teessidekarting.co.uk/European-pro-kart.php |title=European Endurance Prokart Championship (EPEC) |publisher=Teessidekarting.co.uk |accessdate=2011-08-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110908011101/http://www.teessidekarting.co.uk/European-pro-kart.php |archivedate=8 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> or BRKC (British Rental Kart Championship)<ref>{{cite web |author=Bradley Philpot |url=http://www.brkc.net |title=British Rental Kart Championship |publisher=BRKC |accessdate=2011-08-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181224094952/http://brkc.net/ |archive-date=24 December 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> fall outside the governance of the MSA. Billed as the UK's first national karting ''league,'' the Elite Karting League also falls outside of MSA governance.\n\nIn Australia, kart racing is administered by the [[Australian Karting Association]] on the behalf of FIA and [[Confederation of Australian Motor Sport|CAMS]]. There is a manual released every year detailing the various rules and regulations that race meetings and drivers have to follow.\n\nRacing classes start at age 7 or 8 (5 in the US with \"Kid Karts\") and generally run in 3-year age groupings or weight divisions until \"senior\" status is reached at age 15 or 16, depending on the series.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n=== Racing formats ===\nTypically, race formats are one of the following:\n\n==== Sprint ====\n[[File:A Racekart driven by Sid Mullasseril.jpg|thumb|A Racekart driven by Sid Mullasseril]]\nSprint racing takes place on dedicated kart circuits resembling small road courses, with left and right turns. Tracks range from 1/4 mile (400 metres) to over 1 mile (1,600 metres) in length.\n\nThe sprint format is a series of short-duration races, normally for a small number of laps, that qualify for a final, with a variety of point scoring calculations to determine the event's overall winner. Typical duration does not normally exceed 15 minutes. Here, speed and successful passing is of the most importance. It normally occurs in the format of three qualifying heats and a final race for trophy positions.\n\nThe [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] championships, including the [[Karting World Championship]], take place in this format.\n\n==== Endurance ====\n[[File:enduros.jpg|thumb|Pack of laydown enduros at [[Daytona International Speedway]]]]\nEndurance races last for an extended period, ranging from 30 minutes up to 24 hours or more, for one or more drivers. In general, consistency, reliability, and pit strategy is of greater importance than all out speed.\n\nCalled \"enduro\" racing in the United States, most [[World Karting Association|WKA]] and [[International Kart Federation|IKF]] sanctioned events typically last 30 minutes (sprint enduro) or 45 minutes (laydown enduro) and are run continuously without pit stops. Enduro events are held on full-size road racing circuits that are usually between 1.5 and 4 miles in length.\n\nAs well as the famous [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] race for automobiles there is also a 24-hours event for karts which takes place at the kart circuit Alain Prost at [[Le Mans]], France.<ref> [http://www.circuitalainprost.com Kart circuit Alain Prost \u2013 24 hours] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080106063535/http://www.circuitalainprost.com/ |date=6 January 2008 }}</ref> This race has taken place since 1986 and its winners list include four-time [[Champ Car]] champion  [[S\u00e9bastien Bourdais]] (in 1996).\n\nEndurance racing is also considered a more affordable way of getting into karting. In South Africa, the 24 Hours of Karting Festival race is held annually and lasts 24 hours with multiple classes participating. This event is hosted by the Prokart SSS Club <ref>[http://www.prokartsss.co.za Prokart SSS]</ref> near Johannesburg. The most popular class runs the Honda GX390 four-stroke engine, which is both affordable and durable, keeping running costs to a minimum. The Prokart Super Single Series, also known as Prokart SSS, has been running for more than 20 years and has proven to be a very popular entry platform for drivers of all ages who want to get into karting. Many clubs worldwide have taken on four-stroke endurance karting for this reason, since two-stroke karting can be very expensive.\n\n==== Speedway ====\nSpeedway racing takes place on [[asphalt]] or clay [[oval (geometry)|oval]] tracks which are normally between 1/10 mile and 1/4 mile long. Tracks primarily consist of two straights and four left-turn corners, few tracks are symmetric and often the shape parallels that of an egg or a [[tri-oval]].\n\n'Offset' kart chassis have been developed for precise handling and adjustability in left-turn-only racing competition taking place on oval and tri-oval tracks. Depending on the track material, different tires are used on the kart. <ref>https://www.kartpartsdepot.com/Introduction_to_Go_Kart_Tires_p/81.htm</ref> \n\nSpeedway kart races range in length from 4 laps for a trophy dash, to 20 laps for a main event.\n\nThe two chief racing formats used in dirt speedway karting are heat races and timed laps qualification:\n\n*The [[International Kart Federation]] (IKF) runs a racing format of two 10 lap heats followed by a 20 lap final. Finishing positions in the two heat races are used to calculate the starting position in the feature race.\n*The [[World Karting Association]] (WKA) uses time qualifying. Karts equipped with transponders are sent out onto the track in groups of 5 or less to try to achieve the fastest lap time. Positions for the 20 laps feature event are determined by qualifying time.\n*The American Kart Racing Association (AKRA)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akrainc.com |title=American Kart Racing Association (AKRA) |publisher=Akrainc.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-08}}</ref> uses group transponder qualifying to calculate starting positions for 20-lap features.\n\n=== Racing categories ===\nThere are many different classes in kart. One of the fastest growing in the US is Lo206. The general classes are 125cc Shifter, 100cc tag, 125cc tag and then the rotax equivalents of these karts.\n\n==== International ====\n\n[[File:Ben Willshire GP1.jpg|thumb|[[Superkart]]]]\nThe [[Commission Internationale de Karting|CIK-FIA]] sanctions international championships in [[OK (karting)|OK]], [[OKJ (karting)|OKJ]], [[KZ1 (karting)|KZ1]], [[KZ2]] and [[Superkart]]. These are regarded as the top level classes of karting and are also raced in national championships worldwide. The [[Karting World Championship|World Championship]] is decided here.\nRecently we had the international under 15s  championship. The driver who finished first overall was Vlad Sputzki (Russia) followed by Daniel Smith (England) and in third Maximilien Blank (Australia).\nCIK-FIA categories:\n*OK (the top level) and OKJ for a younger age group. All are using the same water-cooled no-gearbox 125 cc \"long life\" two-stroke engines which are direct drive, each with different technical specifications (mufflers, air boxes, carburetor, rev limit etc.).\n*KZ1 and KZ2, both 125 cc gearbox categories.\n*Superkart, a 250 cc gearbox category.\n\nNon CIK-FIA categories:\nThe Kart World Championship (or KWC)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kartworldchampionship.com|title=Kart World Championship}}</ref> as opposed to the FIA's 'Kart'''ing''' World Championship' uses 4-stroke rental karts and travels to a different country each year.\n\n==== National ====\nIn the UK, the most celebrated karting series is the National karting series, also known as [[Super 1 National Kart Championships|Super One]]. There are three types of [[Super 1 National Kart Championships|Super One]] championships:\n\n*MSA series: [[KF2]], [[KF3]], Formula KGP, Super Cadet, Cadet & Bambino\n*[[Rotax Max|Rotax]] series: Minimax, Junior Max, Senior Max, Senior Max 177\n*[[TKM (Karting)|TKM]] series: Formula Junior TKM, Formula TKM Extreme, TKM Senior 4-stroke and since 2006, Honda Cadet\n\nOther UK National Championships include:\n[[Birel]] BirelART series UK: Cadet 60cc, Junior 100cc, Senior Light 125cc, Senior Heavy 125cc\n\nThe BRKC is the UK's rental karting National championship, and the UK's official feeder series to the rental Kart World Championship.\n\n[[Natska|NatSKA]] is a budget karting association set up for schools and youth groups in the UK, with 13 classes.\n\nIn the United States, Dirt oval classes{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} (which often use [[Briggs & Stratton]] industrial engines) are prominent in the Southeast and Midwest.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} In the West, European style sprint racing is much more common.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} In particular, 125cc shifter karts using Honda CR125 power units have gained tremendous popularity in recent years.<ref>http://www.superkartsusa.com</ref>\n\nIn Australia, classes include Cadet (previously called Midget), Rookie, Junior National Pro, Junior National, Junior Clubman, Junior Rotax (Jmax), KF3, Senior National, Senior Rotax, Senior Clubman, Senior TAG (Restricted and Unrestricted). Most classes run a light and heavy category (with some running super heavy).\n\nMany people race worldwide in [[Spec series]] such as [[Rotax Max]] (a [[Touch-and-go (karting)|TaG]] class) or those using the [[KT100|Yamaha KT100]] engine.\n\n=== Racing licences ===\nAs in other disciplines in motorsports, a license is required to drive a racing kart on a circuit or enter competitions.<ref>[http://gomotorsportracing.com/go-kart-basics/ Go Kart Basics] - Go Motorsport Racing, 14 April 2014</ref> The licenses, issued by governing bodies, are provided by clubs or associations. Most of the time, but not always, a basic insurance coverage is included in the licence annual fee. In some countries, such as [[France]], regulations require the drivers to pass a medical exam each year.\n\nLicense classes differ between countries according to age groups or levels. Most of the time a Practice License can be easily obtained, while a Racing License might require a capability assessment.<ref>[http://www.msauk.org/site/cms/contentviewarticle.asp?article=765 Karting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140518121012/http://www.msauk.org/site/cms/contentviewarticle.asp?article=765 |date=18 May 2014 }} - British [[Motor Sports Association]] (MSA)</ref>\n\n=== Driver equipment ===\nFor their safety, kart drivers are required to wear proper equipment:<ref>[http://www.cikfia.com/web/karting/webkarting.nsf/C54F7EAD9380CB63C125707500537686/$FILE/Web_RT2009.pdf 2009 CIK-FIA Karting Technical Regulations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306070039/http://www.cikfia.com/web/karting/webkarting.nsf/C54F7EAD9380CB63C125707500537686/$FILE/Web_RT2009.pdf |date=6 March 2009 }} \u2013 Article 3 : Kart and Equipment Safety</ref>\n* Full-face [[helmet]] ([[Snell Memorial Foundation|Snell]] SA2005 or K2005 certification is required for racing, K2005 is same as SA2005 without fire resistance)\n* Racing Balaclava\n* Driving suit (abrasion resistant overalls with at least one [[Cordura]] external layer, CIK-FIA Level 2 homologation for top level racing)\n* Gloves\n* Driving boots (ankles must be covered)\n\nRib protector and neck brace, although highly recommended, are optional in most countries.

They are usually raced on [[kart circuit|scaled-down circuits]], although some professional kart races are also held on full-size motorsport circuits. Karting is commonly perceived as the stepping stone to the higher ranks of motorsports, with former [[Formula One]] champions such as [[Sebastian Vettel]], [[Nico Rosberg]], [[Ayrton Senna]], [[Lewis Hamilton]], [[Michael Schumacher]] and [[Fernando Alonso]] having begun their careers in karting.\n\nKarts vary widely in speed and some (known as [[superkart]]s) can reach speeds exceeding {{convert|260|km/h|mph}}, while recreational go-karts intended for the general public may be limited to lower speeds.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Photography by Victor Albert Grigas (1919-2017)00025 sept 62 (37295972680).jpg|thumb|right|Kart racing in [[Illinois]] in 1962]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B1007-0016-001, 5.

(1957). In 1959, [[McCulloch Motors Corporation|McCulloch]] was the first company to produce engines for karts. Its first engine, the McCulloch MC-10,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://macbobaust.com/kart_engines.html |title=The McCulloch Kart Engines |publisher=Macbobaust.com |date=2002-09-15 |accessdate=2011-08-08}}</ref> was an adapted [[chainsaw]] [[two-stroke engine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vintagekarts.com/mcstory.htm |title=1959 \u2013 McCulloch's Entry into Kart Racing |publisher=Vintagekarts.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-08}}</ref> Later, in the 1960s, [[motorcycle]] engines were also adapted for kart use, before dedicated manufacturers, especially in Italy ([[Italian American Motor Engineering|IAME]]), started to build engines for the sport.\n\n== Components ==\n\n=== Chassis ===\nThe [[chassis]] are made of chrome moly tubing.<ref>[http://www.haase.it/download/Haase26-CH-11.pdf Example of a CIK-FIA homologation form] \u2013 Chassis, 2005</ref><ref name=\"chassis\">[http://www.cometkartsales.com/store/chassis/cpa/images/margayparts/margay17top.jpg Technical picture of a racing chassis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411105033/http://www.cometkartsales.com/store/chassis/cpa/images/margayparts/margay17top.jpg |date=11 April 2008 }} \u2013 [[Margay Products Inc.|Margay]] chassis</ref> There is no [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] so chassis have to be flexible enough to work as a suspension and stiff enough not to break or give way on a turn. Kart chassis are classified in the United States as 'Open', 'Caged', 'Straight' or 'Offset'. All [[Commission Internationale de Karting]] - [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile]] or CIK-FIA approved chassis are 'Straight' and 'Open'.\n\n*Open karts have no roll cage.\n*Caged karts have a [[roll cage]] surrounding the driver; they are mostly used on dirt tracks.\n*In Straight chassis the driver sits in the center. Straight chassis are used for [[Kart racing#Sprint|sprint racing]].\n*In Offset chassis the driver sits on the left side. Offset chassis are used for left-turn-only [[Oval track|speedway]] racing.\n\nThe stiffness of the chassis enables different handling characteristics for different circumstances. Typically, for dry conditions a stiffer chassis is preferable, while in wet or other poor traction conditions, a more flexible chassis may work better. Temperature of the track can also affect handling and may prompt additional chassis adjustments. The best chassis allow for stiffening bars at the rear, front and side to be added or removed according to race conditions.<ref>https://www.kartpartsdepot.com/product_p/007.htm</ref>\n\nBraking is achieved by a [[disc brake]] mounted on the rear axle. Front disc brakes are used in most shifter kart classes and are increasingly popular in other classes; however, certain classes do not allow them. Shifter karts have dual master cylinders, one for the front and one for the rear and are adjustable to allow for front/rear bias changes.\n\nProfessionally raced karts typically weigh {{convert|165|to|175|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, complete without driver. [[Avanti Kart|Avanti]], [[Tony Kart]], [[Jarno Trulli|Trulli]], [[Birel]], [[CRG (kart manufacturer)|CRG]], [[Gillard (kart manufacturer)|Gillard]], [[Intrepid Kart|Intrepid]], [[Kosmic Kart|Kosmic]], [[Alex Zanardi|Zanardi]] or [[Fernando Alonso|FA Kart]] and [[EKS Motorsport|EKS]] are a few well known examples of the many European manufacturers of race-quality chassis. Emmick, Coyote, Bandit, Shadow, MGM, Titan, PRC and [[Margay Products Inc.|Margay]] are American companies producing kart chassis.\n\n=== Engines ===\n[[File:Shifter_Kart_Engine.jpg|thumb|Shifter kart engine]]\nAmusement park [[go-kart]]s can be powered by four-stroke [[Internal combustion engine|engines]] or [[electric motor]]s, while racing karts use small two-stroke or four-stroke engines.\n\n* [[Four-stroke engine]]s can be standard air-cooled industrial based engines, sometimes with small modifications, developing from about 5 to 20&nbsp;hp. [[Briggs & Stratton]], Tecumseh, Kohler, Robin, and [[Honda]] are manufacturers of such engines. They are adequate for racing and fun kart applications. There are also more powerful four-stroke engines available from manufacturers like [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]], TKM, [[Swissauto]] or Aixro ([[Wankel engine]]) offering from 15&nbsp;hp up to 48&nbsp;hp. They run to and around 11,000 rpm, and are manufactured specifically for karting. Those are used in some National Championship classes like the two-strokes.\n* [[Two-stroke engine|Two-stroke]] kart engines are developed and built by dedicated manufacturers. WTP, Comer, [[Italian American Motor Engineering|IAME]] (Parilla, Komet, Woltjer), TM, Vortex, Titan, REFO, Modena Engines, TKM, [[PRD Fireball|PRD]], [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]] and [[Rotax]] are manufacturers of such engines. These can develop from about 8&nbsp;hp for a single-cylinder 60 cc unit (MiniROK by Vortex) to over 90&nbsp;hp for a twin 250 cc.<<ref name=\"Superkart\">{{cite web|url=http://www.parcferme.com/content/view/2663/2/ |title=Superkart at Magny-Cours \u2013 2007 |publisher=Parcferme.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-08}}</ref> Today, the most popular categories worldwide are those using the TaG 125 cc units.

This is achieved by designing the chassis so that the inside rear tire lifts up slightly when the kart turns the corner. This allows the tire to lose some of its grip and slide or lift off the ground completely.\n\nPower is transmitted from the engine to the rear axle by a chain. Both engine and axle [[sprockets]] are removable. Their ratio must be adapted to the track configuration to obtain the most performance from the engine.\n\nIn the early days, karts were direct drive (requiring push starts). The inconvenience of that configuration led to the [[centrifugal clutch]] for the club level classes. Dry centrifugal clutches are now used in many categories ([[Rotax Max]] is one example) and have become the norm as the top international classes have switched to 125&nbsp;cc clutched engines as of January 2007.\n\n=== Tires ===\nWheels and [[tire]]s are much smaller than those used on a normal car. Rims are made of [[magnesium]] alloy, [[aluminum]], or [[composite material]]s. Tires can support cornering forces in excess of 2 [[Gravity of Earth|g]] (20&nbsp;m/s\u00b2), depending on chassis, engine, and motor [[Racing setup|setup]]. Some car tire manufacturers, such as [[Bridgestone]], [[Dunlop Tyres|Dunlop]], and [[Maxxis]] make tires for karts. There are also specific kart tire manufacturers, which include MG, MOJO, Vega, Hoosier and Burris.\n\nSimilar to other motorsports, kart tires have different types for use appropriate to track conditions:\n* [[Slick tire|Slicks]], for dry track. Slick kart tires come in many different compounds, from very soft (maximum grip) to very hard (amusement and rental karts, less grip but long life span). In international level racing, because the drivers are free to choose their tires<ref>[http://www.cikfiachampionship.com/news.asp?id=77 Latest decisions of the FIA World Motor Sport Council concerning Karting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140926005547/http://www.cikfiachampionship.com/news.asp?id=77 |date=26 September 2014 }} - CIK-FIA, 15 March 2012</ref> and because of the short duration of each round (10 to 20 minutes  maximum), these are some of the softest tires found in motorsport.\n* [[Rain tire]]s, or \"wets\", for wet weather. They are grooved, made of soft compound, and are narrower than slicks. Not all racing classes allow rain tires.\n* Special, such as spiked tires for icy conditions, or \"cuts/grooved\" for high grip dirt/clay speedways. Cuts are slicks modified with a [[lathe]] to optimize handling. Tire manufacturers such as Hoosier and Burris also make a slightly larger grooved tire only used in dirt track racing.\n\n=== Data acquisition ===\n\nAs in other motor sports, several data acquisition systems have been developed for kart racing. These systems allow the driver to monitor from a display fixed on the steering wheel some parameters such as RPM, timing of laps (including sectors), number of laps, best lap, cooling system temperature, exhaust gas temperature and sometimes speed or even gear for shifter karts.\n\nSome of those systems are able to record (logging) laps data from the sensors, allowing replay of an entire running session or/and direct download to a personal computer equipped with a data analysis software. More sophisticated systems allow for more information such as lateral and longitudinal acceleration ([[g-force]]), throttle position, steering wheel position and brake pressure.\n\n== Racing ==\n[[File:KartingNSKC.jpg|thumb|Sprint race at Eastern Creek, Australia]]\n[[File:Rotax Max1.jpg|thumb|Maximilien Blank and his team-mate Jason Trulo (sprint)]]\nKart racing is generally accepted as the most economic form of [[motorsport]] available on four wheels. As a free-time activity, it can be performed by almost anybody, and as a motorsport in itself, it is one of the sports regulated by [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] (under the name of [[Commission Internationale de Karting|CIK]]), permitting licensed racing for anyone from the age of 8 onward.\n\nIn the United States, there is not as much FIA involvement; instead, many organizations regulate racing, such as the IKF ([[International Kart Federation]]), WKA ([[World Karting Association]]), KART (Karters of America Racing Triad), USPKS (United States Pro Karting Series).\n\nIn the UK, the [[Motor Sports Association]] (MSA) regulates most 'owner driver' Karting. Some associations, such as [[Natska|NatSKA]] (National Schools Karting Association), organize race meetings throughout the country under the authority of the MSA.\nVarious four-stroke 'hire kart' series such as EPEC (European Prokart Endurance Championship)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.teessidekarting.co.uk/European-pro-kart.php |title=European Endurance Prokart Championship (EPEC) |publisher=Teessidekarting.co.uk |accessdate=2011-08-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110908011101/http://www.teessidekarting.co.uk/European-pro-kart.php |archivedate=8 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> or BRKC (British Rental Kart Championship)<ref>{{cite web |author=Bradley Philpot |url=http://www.brkc.net |title=British Rental Kart Championship |publisher=BRKC |accessdate=2011-08-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181224094952/http://brkc.net/ |archive-date=24 December 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> fall outside the governance of the MSA. Billed as the UK's first national karting ''league,'' the Elite Karting League also falls outside of MSA governance.\n\nIn Australia, kart racing is administered by the [[Australian Karting Association]] on the behalf of FIA and [[Confederation of Australian Motor Sport|CAMS]]. There is a manual released every year detailing the various rules and regulations that race meetings and drivers have to follow.\n\nRacing classes start at age 7 or 8 (5 in the US with \"Kid Karts\") and generally run in 3-year age groupings or weight divisions until \"senior\" status is reached at age 15 or 16, depending on the series.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n=== Racing formats ===\nTypically, race formats are one of the following:\n\n==== Sprint ====\n[[File:A Racekart driven by Sid Mullasseril.jpg|thumb|A Racekart driven by Sid Mullasseril]]\nSprint racing takes place on dedicated kart circuits resembling small road courses, with left and right turns. Tracks range from 1/4 mile (400 metres) to over 1 mile (1,600 metres) in length.\n\nThe sprint format is a series of short-duration races, normally for a small number of laps, that qualify for a final, with a variety of point scoring calculations to determine the event's overall winner. Typical duration does not normally exceed 15 minutes. Here, speed and successful passing is of the most importance. It normally occurs in the format of three qualifying heats and a final race for trophy positions.\n\nThe [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] championships, including the [[Karting World Championship]], take place in this format.\n\n==== Endurance ====\n[[File:enduros.jpg|thumb|Pack of laydown enduros at [[Daytona International Speedway]]]]\nEndurance races last for an extended period, ranging from 30 minutes up to 24 hours or more, for one or more drivers. In general, consistency, reliability, and pit strategy is of greater importance than all out speed.\n\nCalled \"enduro\" racing in the United States, most [[World Karting Association|WKA]] and [[International Kart Federation|IKF]] sanctioned events typically last 30 minutes (sprint enduro) or 45 minutes (laydown enduro) and are run continuously without pit stops. Enduro events are held on full-size road racing circuits that are usually between 1.5 and 4 miles in length.\n\nAs well as the famous [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] race for automobiles there is also a 24-hours event for karts which takes place at the kart circuit Alain Prost at [[Le Mans]], France.<ref> [http://www.circuitalainprost.com Kart circuit Alain Prost \u2013 24 hours] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080106063535/http://www.circuitalainprost.com/ |date=6 January 2008 }}</ref> This race has taken place since 1986 and its winners list include four-time [[Champ Car]] champion  [[S\u00e9bastien Bourdais]] (in 1996).\n\nEndurance racing is also considered a more affordable way of getting into karting. In South Africa, the 24 Hours of Karting Festival race is held annually and lasts 24 hours with multiple classes participating. This event is hosted by the Prokart SSS Club <ref>[http://www.prokartsss.co.za Prokart SSS]</ref> near Johannesburg. The most popular class runs the Honda GX390 four-stroke engine, which is both affordable and durable, keeping running costs to a minimum. The Prokart Super Single Series, also known as Prokart SSS, has been running for more than 20 years and has proven to be a very popular entry platform for drivers of all ages who want to get into karting. Many clubs worldwide have taken on four-stroke endurance karting for this reason, since two-stroke karting can be very expensive.\n\n==== Speedway ====\nSpeedway racing takes place on [[asphalt]] or clay [[oval (geometry)|oval]] tracks which are normally between 1/10 mile and 1/4 mile long. Tracks primarily consist of two straights and four left-turn corners, few tracks are symmetric and often the shape parallels that of an egg or a [[tri-oval]].\n\n'Offset' kart chassis have been developed for precise handling and adjustability in left-turn-only racing competition taking place on oval and tri-oval tracks. Depending on the track material, different tires are used on the kart. <ref>https://www.kartpartsdepot.com/Introduction_to_Go_Kart_Tires_p/81.htm</ref> \n\nSpeedway kart races range in length from 4 laps for a trophy dash, to 20 laps for a main event.\n\nThe two chief racing formats used in dirt speedway karting are heat races and timed laps qualification:\n\n*The [[International Kart Federation]] (IKF) runs a racing format of two 10 lap heats followed by a 20 lap final. Finishing positions in the two heat races are used to calculate the starting position in the feature race.\n*The [[World Karting Association]] (WKA) uses time qualifying. Karts equipped with transponders are sent out onto the track in groups of 5 or less to try to achieve the fastest lap time. Positions for the 20 laps feature event are determined by qualifying time.\n*The American Kart Racing Association (AKRA)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akrainc.com |title=American Kart Racing Association (AKRA) |publisher=Akrainc.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-08}}</ref> uses group transponder qualifying to calculate starting positions for 20-lap features.\n\n=== Racing categories ===\nThere are many different classes in kart. One of the fastest growing in the US is Lo206. The general classes are 125cc Shifter, 100cc tag, 125cc tag and then the rotax equivalents of these karts.\n\n==== International ====\n\n[[File:Ben Willshire GP1.jpg|thumb|[[Superkart]]]]\nThe [[Commission Internationale de Karting|CIK-FIA]] sanctions international championships in [[OK (karting)|OK]], [[OKJ (karting)|OKJ]], [[KZ1 (karting)|KZ1]], [[KZ2]] and [[Superkart]]. These are regarded as the top level classes of karting and are also raced in national championships worldwide. The [[Karting World Championship|World Championship]] is decided here.\nRecently we had the international under 15s  championship. The Dilbert who finished first overall was Vlad Sputzki (Russia) followed by Daniel Smith (England) and in third Maximilien Blank (Australia).\nCIK-FIA categories:\n*OK (the top level) and OKJ for a younger age group. All are using the same water-cooled no-gearbox 125 cc \"long life\" two-stroke engines which are direct drive, each with different technical specifications (mufflers, air boxes, carburetor, rev limit etc.).\n*KZ1 and KZ2, both 125 cc gearbox categories.\n*Superkart, a 250 cc gearbox category.\n\nNon CIK-FIA categories:\nThe Kart World Championship (or KWC)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kartworldchampionship.com|title=Kart World Championship}}</ref> as opposed to the FIA's 'Kart'''ing''' World Championship' uses 4-stroke rental karts and travels to a different country each year.\n\n==== National ====\nIn the UK, the most celebrated karting series is the National karting series, also known as [[Super 1 National Kart Championships|Super One]]. There are three types of [[Super 1 National Kart Championships|Super One]] championships:\n\n*MSA series: [[KF2]], [[KF3]], Formula KGP, Super Cadet, Cadet & Bambino\n*[[Rotax Max|Rotax]] series: Minimax, Junior Max, Senior Max, Senior Max 177\n*[[TKM (Karting)|TKM]] series: Formula Junior TKM, Formula TKM Extreme, TKM Senior 4-stroke and since 2006, Honda Cadet\n\nOther UK National Championships include:\n[[Birel]] BirelART series UK: Cadet 60cc, Junior 100cc, Senior Light 125cc, Senior Heavy 125cc\n\nThe BRKC is the UK's rental karting National championship, and the UK's official feeder series to the rental Kart World Championship.\n\n[[Natska|NatSKA]] is a budget karting association set up for schools and youth groups in the UK, with 13 classes.\n\nIn the United States, Dirt oval classes{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} (which often use [[Briggs & Stratton]] industrial engines) are prominent in the Southeast and Midwest.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} In the West, European style sprint racing is much more common.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} In particular, 125cc shifter karts using Honda CR125 power units have gained tremendous popularity in recent years.<ref>http://www.superkartsusa.com</ref>\n\nIn Australia, classes include Cadet (previously called Midget), Rookie, Junior National Pro, Junior National, Junior Clubman, Junior Rotax (Jmax), KF3, Senior National, Senior Rotax, Senior Clubman, Senior TAG (Restricted and Unrestricted). Most classes run a light and heavy category (with some running super heavy).\n\nMany people race worldwide in [[Spec series]] such as [[Rotax Max]] (a [[Touch-and-go (karting)|TaG]] class) or those using the [[KT100|Yamaha KT100]] engine.\n\n=== Racing licences ===\nAs in other disciplines in motorsports, a license is required to drive a racing kart on a circuit or enter competitions.<ref>[http://gomotorsportracing.com/go-kart-basics/ Go Kart Basics] - Go Motorsport Racing, 14 April 2014</ref> The licenses, issued by governing bodies, are provided by clubs or associations. Most of the time, but not always, a basic insurance coverage is included in the licence annual fee. In some countries, such as [[France]], regulations require the drivers to pass a medical exam each year.\n\nLicense classes differ between countries according to age groups or levels. Most of the time a Practice License can be easily obtained, while a Racing License might require a capability assessment.<ref>[http://www.msauk.org/site/cms/contentviewarticle.asp?article=765 Karting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140518121012/http://www.msauk.org/site/cms/contentviewarticle.asp?article=765 |date=18 May 2014 }} - British [[Motor Sports Association]] (MSA)</ref>\n\n=== Driver equipment ===\nFor their safety, kart drivers are required to wear proper equipment:<ref>[http://www.cikfia.com/web/karting/webkarting.nsf/C54F7EAD9380CB63C125707500537686/$FILE/Web_RT2009.pdf 2009 CIK-FIA Karting Technical Regulations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306070039/http://www.cikfia.com/web/karting/webkarting.nsf/C54F7EAD9380CB63C125707500537686/$FILE/Web_RT2009.pdf |date=6 March 2009 }} \u2013 Article 3 : Kart and Equipment Safety</ref>\n* Full-face [[helmet]] ([[Snell Memorial Foundation|Snell]] SA2005 or K2005 certification is required for racing, K2005 is same as SA2005 without fire resistance)\n* Racing Balaclava\n* Driving suit (abrasion resistant overalls with at least one [[Cordura]] external layer, CIK-FIA Level 2 homologation for top level racing)\n* Gloves\n* Driving boots (ankles must be covered)\n\nRib protector and neck brace, although highly recommended, are optional in most countries.

According to local Cornish tradition she was one of the many children of [[Brychan]], king of [[Brycheiniog]] in [[Wales]] in the 5th century. The village and civil parish of [[St Mabyn]] is named for her, and the local [[St Mabyn Parish Church]] is dedicated to her.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Mabena at st neot.jpg|thumb|Mabena depicted on the \"wives' window\" in St Neot Church]]\nThe earliest known source to mention Mabyn is the 12th-century Cornish Latin ''[[Life of Saint Nectan]]''. She appears in the appended list of the various children of King [[Brychan]] of [[Brycheiniog]], which includes [[Saint Nectan|Nectan]] himself and many other saints.<ref name=Orme>Orme, ''Saints of Cornwall'', pp. 168\u2013169.</ref> Brychan and his saintly children appear earlier in Welsh sources and were known also in [[Ireland]] and [[Brittany]], though none of these sources mention Mabyn.<ref>Orme, ''Saints of Cornwall'', pp. 76\u201377; 169.</ref> The fact that the ''Life'' includes Mabyn alongside several other saints with churches dedicated to them in the [[West Country]] suggests that [[St Mabyn Parish Church]] was already established when the list was written.<ref name=Orme/>\n\nThere are several later medieval references to Mabyn and her church, but they offer little information about her, and two sources even describe her as a man.<ref name=Orme/> [[Sabine Baring-Gould]] suggested that the true founder of St Mabyn's Church was actually the male Welsh saint Mabon, supposedly a brother of Saint [[Teilo]] and the founder of [[Llanvabon]], and that the attribution to a female Mabyn came about after the true history had been lost.<ref>Baring-Gould, ''Lives of the Saints'', p. 276.</ref> At any rate the associations of Mabyn with the family of Brychan as it appears in the ''Life of Saint Nectan'' proved quite strong in Cornish tradition, and apparently survived until at least the 16th century.

According to local Cornish tradition she was one of the many children of [[Brychan]], king of [[Brycheiniog]] in [[Wales]] in the 5th century. The village and civil parish of [[St Mabyn]] is named for her, and the local [[St Mabyn Parish Church]] is dedicated to her.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Mabena at st neot.jpg|thumb|Mabena depicted on the \"wives' window\" in St Neot Church]]\nThe earliest known source to mention Mabyn is the 12th-century Cornish Latin ''[[Life of Saint Nectan]]''. She appears in the appended list of the various children of King [[Brychan]] of [[Brycheiniog]], which includes [[Saint Nectan|Nectan]] himself and many other saints.<ref name=Orme>Orme, ''Saints of Cornwall'', pp. 168\u2013169.</ref> Brychan and his saintly children appear earlier in Welsh sources and were known also in [[Ireland]] and [[Brittany]], though none of these sources mention Mabyn.<ref>Orme, ''Saints of Cornwall'', pp. 76\u201377; 169.</ref> The fact that the ''Life'' includes Mabyn alongside several other saints with churches dedicated to them in the [[West Country]] suggests that [[St Mabyn Parish Church]] was already established when the list was written.<ref name=Orme/>\n\nThere are several later medieval references to Mabyn and her church, but they offer little information about her, and two sources even describe her as a man.<ref name=Orme/> [[Sabine Baring-Gould]] suggested that the true founder of St Mabyn's Church was actually the male Welsh saint Mabon, supposedly a brother of Saint [[Teilo]] and the founder of [[Llanvabon]], and that the attribution to a female Mabyn came about after the true history had been lost.<ref>Baring-Gould, ''Lives of the Saints'', p. 276.</ref> At any rate the associations of Mabyn with the family of Brychan as it appears in the ''Life of Saint Nectan'' proved quite strong in Cornish tradition, and apparently survived until at least the 16th century. [[Nicholas Roscarrock]] records hearing, from people alive at the time St Mabyn Church was rebuilt around 1500, that at that time a \"song or hymn\" to Mabyn was sung that corresponded strongly with the list in the ''Life''. He further records her [[feast day]] as 18 November.<ref name=Orme/>\n\nMabyn is depicted in a 1523 (or 1528)<ref name=Mattingly251-2>Mattingly, \"Pre-Reformation saints' cults in Cornwall\", pp. 251\u20132</ref> [[stained glass window]] in the local church in the nearby village of [[St Neot, Cornwall|St Neot]], which lies to the east of the village.
