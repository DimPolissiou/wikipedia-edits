The [[concept]] of truth is discussed and [[debate]]d in several contexts, including philosophy, art, theology, and science. Most human activities depend upon the concept, where its nature as a concept is assumed rather than being a subject of discussion; these include most of the [[science]]s, [[law]], [[journalism]], and everyday life. Some philosophers view the concept of truth as basic, and unable to be explained in any terms that are more easily understood than the concept of truth itself. To some, truth is viewed as the correspondence of [[language]] or [[thought]] to an independent [[reality]], in what is sometimes called the [[correspondence theory of truth]].\n\nVarious theories and views of truth continue to be debated among scholars, philosophers, and theologians.<ref name=PUP32014>{{cite book|author1=Alexis G.

The method used to determine whether something is a truth is termed a [[criteria of truth|criterion of truth]]. There are varying stances on such questions as what constitutes truth: what things are [[truthbearer]]s capable of being true or false; how to define, identify, and distinguish truth; what roles do faith and empirical knowledge play; and whether truth can be [[Subjectivity|subjective]] or if it is [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] (in other words, [[knowledge relativity|relative truth]] versus [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute truth]]).\n\n==Definition and etymology==\n{{Further|Veritas|Aletheia|Tryggvi}}\n{{anchor|treowe}}\n[[File:An angel carrying the banner of \"Truth\", Roslin, Midlothian.JPG|thumb|left|An angel carrying the banner of \"Truth\", [[Roslin, Midlothian]]]]\nThe English word ''[[:wikt:truth|truth]]'' is derived from [[Old English]] ''tr\u00edew\u00fe, tr\u00e9ow\u00fe, tr\u00fdw\u00fe'', [[Middle English]] ''trew\u00fee'', cognate to [[Old High German]] ''triuwida'', [[Old Norse]] ''trygg\u00f0''.

Each presents perspectives that are widely shared by published scholars.<ref name=\"EPT\">[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Supp., \"Truth\", auth: Michael Williams, pp. 572\u201373 (Macmillan, 1996)</ref><ref>Blackburn, Simon, and Simmons, Keith (eds., 1999), ''Truth'', Oxford University Press, Oxford.

More recently developed \"[[deflationary theory of truth|deflationary]]\" or \"minimalist\" theories of truth have emerged as possible alternatives to the most prevalent substantive theories. Minimalist reasoning centres around the notion that the application of a term like ''true'' to a statement does not assert anything significant about it, for instance, anything about its ''nature''. Minimalist reasoning realises ''truth'' as a label utilised in general discourse to express agreement, to stress claims, or to form general assumptions.<ref name = EPT/><ref>Horwich, Paul, ''Truth'', (2nd edition, 1988),</ref><ref>Field, Hartry, ''Truth and the Absence of Fact'' (2001).</ref>\n\n===Substantive===\n====Correspondence====\n{{Main|Correspondence theory of truth}}\nCorrespondence theories emphasise that true beliefs and true statements correspond to the actual state of affairs.<ref>[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, \"Correspondence Theory of Truth\", auth.: [[Arthur N. Prior]], p. 223 (Macmillan, 1969). Prior uses [[Bertrand Russell]]'s wording in defining correspondence theory. According to Prior, Russell was substantially responsible for helping to make correspondence theory widely known under this name.</ref> This type of theory stresses a relationship between thoughts or statements on one hand, and things or objects on the other. It is a traditional model tracing its origins to [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] philosophers such as [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]].<ref>[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, \"Correspondence Theory of Truth\", auth.: Arthur N. Prior, pp. 223\u201324 (Macmillan, 1969).</ref> This class of theories holds that the truth or the falsity of a representation is determined in principle entirely by how it relates to \"things\" by whether it accurately describes those \"things\". A classic example of correspondence theory is the statement by the thirteenth century philosopher and theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]]: \"[[Veritas est adaequatio rei et intellectus]]\" (\"Truth is the adequation of things and [[intellect]]\"), which Aquinas attributed to the ninth century [[Neoplatonist]] [[Isaac Israeli ben Solomon|Isaac Israeli]].<ref>[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol. 2, \"Correspondence Theory of Truth\", auth.: Arthur N.

Q.16).</ref>\n\nCorrespondence theory centres heavily around the assumption that truth is a matter of accurately copying what is known as \"[[objective reality]]\" and then representing it in thoughts, words and other symbols.<ref>''See, e.g.,'' Bradley, F.H., \"On Truth and Copying\", in Blackburn, ''et al.'' (eds., 1999),''Truth'', 31\u201345.</ref> Many modern theorists have stated that this ideal cannot be achieved without analysing additional factors.<ref name=EPT/><ref>[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, \"Correspondence Theory of Truth\", auth: Arthur N. Prior, pp. 223 ''ff''. Macmillan, 1969. See especially, section on \"Moore's Correspondence Theory\", 225\u201326, \"Russell's Correspondence Theory\", 226\u201327, \"Remsey and Later Wittgenstein\", 228\u201329, \"Tarski's Semantic Theory\", 230\u201331.</ref> For example, language plays a role in that all languages have words to represent concepts that are virtually undefined in other languages. The [[German language|German]] word ''[[Zeitgeist]]'' is one such example: one who speaks or understands the language may \"know\" what it means, but any translation of the word apparently fails to accurately capture its full meaning (this is a problem with many abstract words, especially those derived in [[agglutinative languages]]). Thus, some words add an additional parameter to the construction of an accurate [[truth predicate]]. Among the philosophers who grappled with this problem is [[Alfred Tarski]], whose [[semantic theory of truth|semantic theory]] is summarized further below in this article.<ref>[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, \"Correspondence Theory of Truth\", auth: Arthur N. Prior, pp. 223 ''ff''. Macmillan, 1969. See the section on \"Tarski's Semantic Theory\", 230\u201331.</ref>\n\nProponents of several of the theories below have gone further to assert that there are yet other issues necessary to the analysis, such as interpersonal power struggles, community interactions, personal biases and other factors involved in deciding what is seen as truth.\n\n====Coherence====\n{{Main|Coherence theory of truth}}\n[[File:Statue of Truth.jpg|thumb|left|[[Walter Seymour Allward]]'s ''Veritas'' (Truth) outside [[Supreme Court of Canada]], [[Ottawa, Ontario]] [[Canada]]]]\n\nFor coherence theories in general, truth requires a proper fit of elements within a whole system. Very often, though, coherence is taken to imply something more than simple logical consistency; often there is a demand that the propositions in a coherent system lend mutual inferential support to each other. So, for example, the completeness and comprehensiveness of the underlying set of concepts is a critical factor in judging the validity and usefulness of a coherent system.<ref>[[Immanuel Kant]], for instance, assembled a controversial but quite coherent system in the early 19th century, whose validity and usefulness continues to be debated even today. Similarly, the systems of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[Spinoza]] are characteristic systems that are internally coherent but controversial in terms of their utility and validity.</ref>  A pervasive tenet of coherence theories is the idea that truth is primarily a property of whole systems of propositions, and can be ascribed to individual propositions only according to their coherence with the whole.  Among the assortment of perspectives commonly regarded as coherence theory, theorists differ on the question of whether coherence entails many possible true systems of thought or only a single absolute system.\n\nSome variants of coherence theory are claimed to describe the essential and intrinsic properties of [[formal system]]s in logic and mathematics.<ref>[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, \"Coherence Theory of Truth\", auth: Alan R. White, pp. 130\u201331 (Macmillan, 1969)</ref>  However, formal reasoners are content to contemplate [[independence (mathematical logic)|axiomatically independent]] and sometimes mutually contradictory systems side by side, for example, the various [[noneuclidean geometry|alternative geometries]]. On the whole, coherence theories have been rejected for lacking justification in their application to other areas of truth, especially with respect to assertions about the [[Natural environment|natural world]], [[empirical]] data in general, assertions about practical matters of psychology and society, especially when used without support from the other major theories of truth.<ref>[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, \"Coherence Theory of Truth\", auth: Alan R. White, pp. 131\u201333, ''see'' esp., section on \"Epistemological assumptions\" (Macmillan, 1969)</ref>\n\nCoherence theories distinguish the thought of [[rationalism|rationalist]] philosophers, particularly of [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], along with the British philosopher [[F. H. Bradley]].<ref>[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, \"Coherence Theory of Truth\", auth: Alan R. White, p. 130</ref>  They have found a resurgence also among several proponents of [[logical positivism]], notably [[Otto Neurath]] and [[Carl Hempel]].\n\n====Pragmatic====\n{{Main|Pragmatic theory of truth}}\n\nThe three most influential forms of the ''pragmatic theory of truth'' were introduced around the turn of the 20th century by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]], and [[John Dewey]].  Although there are wide differences in viewpoint among these and other proponents of pragmatic theory, they hold in common that truth is verified and confirmed by the results of putting one's concepts into practice.<ref>[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol. 5, \"Pragmatic Theory of Truth\", 427 (Macmillan, 1969).</ref>\n\n[[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]] defines truth as follows:  \"Truth is that concordance of an abstract statement with the ideal limit towards which endless investigation would tend to bring scientific belief, which concordance the abstract statement may possess by virtue of the confession of its inaccuracy and one-sidedness, and this confession is an essential ingredient of truth.\"<ref name=\"Peirce Truth and Falsity\">Peirce, C.S. (1901), \"Truth and Falsity and Error\" (in part), pp. 716\u201320 in [[James Mark Baldwin]], ed., ''Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology'', v. 2. Peirce's section is entitled \"''Logical''\", beginning on p. 718, column 1, and ending on p. 720 with the initials \"(C.S.P.)\", see Google Books [https://archive.org/details/beginningthirdr00randgoog/page/n748 <!-- pg=718 --> Eprint]. Reprinted, ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers]]'' v. 5, pp. 565\u201373.</ref>  This statement stresses Peirce's view that ideas of approximation, incompleteness, and partiality, what he describes elsewhere as ''[[fallibilism]]'' and \"reference to the future\", are essential to a proper conception of truth.  Although Peirce uses words like ''concordance'' and ''correspondence'' to describe one aspect of the pragmatic [[sign relation]], he is also quite explicit in saying that definitions of truth based on mere correspondence are no more than ''nominal'' definitions, which he accords a lower status than ''real'' definitions.\n\n[[William James]]'s version of pragmatic theory, while complex, is often summarized by his statement that \"the 'true' is only the expedient in our way of thinking, just as the 'right' is only the expedient in our way of behaving.\"<ref name=WJP>James, William, ''The Meaning of Truth, A Sequel to 'Pragmatism','' (1909).</ref>  By this, James meant that truth is a ''quality'', the value of which is confirmed by its effectiveness when applying concepts to practice (thus, \"pragmatic\").\n\n[[John Dewey]], less broadly than James but more broadly than Peirce, held that [[inquiry]], whether scientific, technical, sociological, philosophical or cultural, is self-corrective over time ''if''  openly submitted for testing by a community of inquirers in order to clarify, justify, refine and/or refute proposed truths.<ref>[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, \"Dewey, John\", auth [[Richard J. Bernstein]], p. 383 (Macmillan, 1969)</ref>\n\nThough not widely known, a new variation of the pragmatic theory was defined and wielded successfully from the 20th century forward. Defined and named by [[William Ernest Hocking]], this variation is known as \"negative pragmatism\".  Essentially, what works may or may not be true, but what fails cannot be true because the truth always works.<ref>Sahakian, W.S. & Sahakian, M.L., Ideas of the Great Philosophers, New York: Barnes & Noble, 1966, {{LCCN|66-23155}}</ref> [[Richard Feynman]] also ascribed to it: \"We never are definitely right, we can only be sure we are wrong.\"<ref name=\"FeynmanThe\">Feynman, The Character of Physical Law, New York: Random House, 1994, {{ISBN|0-679-60127-9}}.</ref> This approach incorporates many of the ideas from Peirce, James, and Dewey.  For Peirce, the idea of \"... endless investigation would tend to bring about scientific belief ...\" fits negative pragmatism in that a negative pragmatist would never stop testing.  As Feynman noted, an idea or theory \"... could never be proved right, because tomorrow's experiment might succeed in proving wrong what you thought was right.\"<ref name=\"FeynmanThe\" />  Similarly, James and Dewey's ideas also ascribe truth to repeated testing which is \"self-corrective\" over time.\n\nPragmatism and negative pragmatism are also closely aligned with the [[coherence theory of truth]] in that any testing should not be isolated but rather incorporate knowledge from all human endeavors and experience.  The universe is a whole and integrated system, and testing should acknowledge and account for its diversity.  As Feynman said, \"... if it disagrees with experiment, it is wrong.\"<ref>Feynman, ''The Character of Physical Law'', p. 150.</ref>\n\n====Constructivist====\n{{Main|Constructivist epistemology}}\n\n[[Constructivist epistemology|Social constructivism]] holds that truth is constructed by social processes, is historically and culturally specific, and that it is in part shaped through the power struggles within a community. Constructivism views all of our knowledge as \"constructed,\" because it does not reflect any external \"transcendent\" realities (as a pure correspondence theory might hold).  Rather, perceptions of truth are viewed as contingent on convention, human perception, and social experience. It is believed by constructivists that representations of physical and biological reality, including [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], and [[gender]], are socially constructed.\n\n[[Giambattista Vico]] was among the first to claim that history and culture were man-made. Vico's [[epistemology|epistemological]] orientation gathers the most diverse rays and unfolds in one axiom\u2014''verum ipsum factum''\u2014\"truth itself is constructed\". [[Hegel]] and [[Marx]] were among the other early proponents of the premise that truth is, or can be, socially constructed. Marx, like many critical theorists who followed, did not reject the existence of objective truth but rather distinguished between true knowledge and knowledge that has been distorted through power or ideology. For Marx, scientific and true knowledge is \"in accordance with the dialectical understanding of history\" and ideological knowledge is \"an epiphenomenal expression of the relation of material forces in a given economic arrangement\".<ref>{{cite book |author1=May, Todd |authorlink1=Todd May |title=Between Genealogy and Epistemology: Psychology, Politics, and Knowledge in the Thought of Michel Foucault |date=1993 |publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press |location=University Park |isbn=978-0271027821|oclc= 26553016|page= }}</ref>{{page needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n====Consensus====\n{{Main|Consensus theory of truth}}\n\n[[Consensus theory of truth|Consensus theory]] holds that truth is whatever is agreed upon, or in some versions, might come to be agreed upon, by some specified group. Such a group might include all human beings, or a [[subset]] thereof consisting of more than one person.\n\nAmong the current advocates of consensus theory as a useful accounting of the concept of \"truth\" is the philosopher [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]].<ref>''See, e.g.'', Habermas, J\u00fcrgen, ''Knowledge and Human Interests'' (English translation, 1972).</ref> Habermas maintains that truth is what would be agreed upon in an [[ideal speech situation]].<ref>''See, e.g.'', Habermas, J\u00fcrgen, ''Knowledge and Human Interests'' (English translation, 1972), esp. Part III, pp. 187 ''ff''.</ref> Among the current strong critics of consensus theory is the philosopher [[Nicholas Rescher]].<ref>Rescher, Nicholas, ''Pluralism: Against the Demand for Consensus'' (1995).</ref>\n\nIn the Islamic tradition, this principle is exemplified by the [[hadith]] in which [[Muhammad]] states, \"My [[ummah|community]] will never agree upon an error\"<ref>Narrated by [http://sunnah.com/tirmidhi/33/10 al-Tirmidhi (4:2167)], ibn Majah (2:1303), Abu Dawood, and others with slightly different wordings.</ref>\n\n===Minimalist===\n====Deflationary====\n{{Main|Deflationary theory of truth}}\n\nModern developments in the field of philosophy, starting with the relatively modern notion that a theory being old does not necessarily imply that it is completely flawless, have resulted in the rise of a new thesis: that the term ''truth'' does not denote a real property of sentences or propositions. This thesis is in part a response to the common use of ''truth predicates'' (e.g., that some particular thing \"...is true\") which was particularly prevalent in philosophical discourse on truth in the first half of the 20th century.  From this point of view, to assert that \"'2 + 2 = 4' is true\" is logically equivalent to asserting that \"2 + 2 = 4\", and the phrase \"is true\" is completely dispensable in this and every other context. In common parlance, truth predicates are not commonly heard, and it would be interpreted as an unusual occurrence were someone to utilise a truth predicate in an everyday conversation when asserting that something is true. Newer perspectives that take this discrepancy into account and work with sentence structures that are actually employed in common discourse can be broadly described:\n* as ''deflationary'' theories of truth, since they attempt to deflate the presumed importance of the words \"true\" or ''truth'',\n* as ''disquotational'' theories, to draw attention to the disappearance of the quotation marks in cases like the above example, or\n* as ''minimalist'' theories of truth.<ref name=EPT/><ref>Blackburn, Simon, and Simmons, Keith (eds., 1999), ''Truth'' in the Introductory section of the book.</ref>\n\nWhichever term is used, deflationary theories can be said to hold in common that \"[t]he predicate 'true' is an expressive convenience, not the name of a property requiring deep analysis.\"<ref name=EPT/> Once we have identified the truth predicate's formal features and utility, deflationists argue, we have said all there is to be said about truth. Among the theoretical concerns of these views is to explain away those special cases where it ''does'' appear that the concept of truth has peculiar and interesting properties. (See, e.g., [[Semantic paradox]]es, and below.)\n\nIn addition to highlighting such formal aspects of the predicate \"is true\", some deflationists point out that the concept enables us to express things that might otherwise require infinitely long sentences. For example, one cannot express confidence in Michael's accuracy by asserting the endless sentence:\n:''Michael says, 'snow is white' and snow is white, or he says 'roses are red' and roses are red or he says ... etc.''\nThis assertion can also be succinctly expressed by saying: ''What Michael says is true''.<ref>[[Richard Kirkham]], [[Theories of Truth: A Critical Introduction]], MIT Press, 1992.</ref>\n\n====Performative====\nAttributed to [[P. F. Strawson]] is the performative theory of truth which holds that to say \"'Snow is white' is true\" is to perform the [[speech act]] of signaling one's agreement with the claim that snow is white (much like nodding one's head in agreement). The idea that some statements are more actions than communicative statements is not as odd as it may seem. Consider, for example, that when the wedding couple say \"I do\" at the appropriate time in a wedding, they are performing the act of taking the other to be their lawful wedded spouse. They are not ''describing'' themselves as taking the other, but actually ''doing'' so (perhaps the most thorough analysis of such \"illocutionary acts\" is [[J. L. Austin]], \"[[How to Do Things With Words]]\"<ref>J. L. Austin, \"How to Do Things With Words\". Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1975</ref>).\n\nStrawson holds that a similar analysis is applicable to all speech acts, not just illocutionary ones: \"To say a statement is true is not to make a statement about a statement, but rather to perform the act of agreeing with, accepting, or endorsing a statement.  When one says 'It's true that it's raining,' one asserts no more than 'It's raining.'  The function of [the statement] 'It's true that...' is to agree with, accept, or endorse the statement that 'it's raining.'\"<ref>[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol. 6: ''Performative Theory of Truth'', auth: Gertrude Ezorsky, p. 88 (Macmillan, 1969)</ref>\n\n====Redundancy and related====\n{{Main|Redundancy theory of truth}}\n\nAccording to the [[redundancy theory of truth]], asserting that a statement is true is completely equivalent to asserting the statement itself.  For example, making the assertion that \"&nbsp;'Snow is white' is true\" is equivalent to asserting \"Snow is white\".  Redundancy theorists infer from this premise that truth is a redundant concept; that is, it is merely a word that is traditionally used in conversation or writing, generally for emphasis, but not a word that actually equates to anything in reality.  This theory is commonly attributed to [[Frank P. Ramsey]], who held that the use of words like ''fact'' and ''truth'' was nothing but a [[periphrasis|roundabout]] way of asserting a proposition, and that treating these words as separate problems in isolation from judgment was merely a \"linguistic muddle\".<ref name=\"EPT\"/><ref>Ramsey, F.P. (1927), \"Facts and Propositions\", Aristotelian Society Supplementary Volume 7, 153\u201370. Reprinted, pp. 34\u201351 in F.P. Ramsey, Philosophical Papers, David Hugh Mellor (ed.), Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1990</ref><ref>Le Morvan, Pierre. (2004) \"Ramsey on Truth and Truth on Ramsey\", ''The British Journal for the History of Philosophy'' 12(4), pp. 705\u201318.</ref>\n\nA variant of redundancy theory is the disquotational theory which uses a modified form of [[Alfred Tarski|Tarski]]'s [[Truth#Semantic theory of truth|schema]]: To say that '\"P\" is true' is to say that P.  A version of this theory was defended by [[C. J. F. Williams]] in his book ''What is Truth?''  Yet another version of deflationism is the prosentential theory of truth, first developed by Dorothy Grover, Joseph Camp, and [[Nuel Belnap]] as an elaboration of Ramsey's claims.  They argue that sentences like \"That's true\", when said in response to \"It's raining\", are [[prosentence]]s, expressions that merely repeat the content of other expressions.  In the same way that ''it'' means the same as ''my dog'' in the sentence ''My dog was hungry, so I fed it'', ''That's true'' is supposed to mean the same as ''It's raining''\u2014if you say the latter and I then say the former.  These variations do not necessarily follow Ramsey in asserting that truth is ''not'' a property, but rather can be understood to say that, for instance, the assertion \"P\" may well involve a substantial truth, and the theorists in this case are minimizing only the redundancy or prosentence involved in the statement such as \"that's true.\"<ref name=EPT/>\n\nDeflationary principles do not apply to representations that are not analogous to sentences, and also do not apply to many other things that are commonly judged to be true or otherwise.  Consider the analogy between the sentence \"Snow is white\" and the character named Snow White, both of which can be true in some sense.

Logicians use [[formal language]]s to express the truths which they are concerned with, and as such there is only truth under some [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] or truth within some [[logical system]].\n\nA logical truth (also called an analytic truth or a necessary truth) is a statement which is true in all possible worlds<ref>[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]''.</ref> or under all possible interpretations, as contrasted to a ''[[fact]]'' (also called a ''[[Analytic-synthetic distinction|synthetic claim]]'' or a ''[[Necessary and sufficient condition|contingency]]'') which is only true in this [[World (philosophy)|world]] as it has historically unfolded. A proposition such as \"If p and q, then p\" is considered to be a logical truth because of the meaning of the [[symbol (formal)|symbols]] and [[well-formed formula|words]] in it and not because of any fact of any particular world.

Here he restricted it in this way: no language could contain its own truth predicate, that is, the expression ''is true'' could only apply to sentences in some other language. The latter he called an ''object language'', the language being talked about. (It may, in turn, have a truth predicate that can be applied to sentences in still another language.) The reason for his restriction was that languages that contain their own truth predicate will contain [[Liar paradox|paradoxical]] sentences such as, \"This sentence is not true\". As a result, Tarski held that the semantic theory could not be applied to any natural language, such as English, because they contain their own truth predicates. [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] used it as the foundation of his [[truth-conditional semantics]] and linked it to [[radical interpretation]] in a form of [[coherentism]].\n\n[[Bertrand Russell]] is credited with noticing the existence of such paradoxes even in the best symbolic formations of mathematics in his day, in particular the paradox that came to be named after him, [[Russell's paradox]]. Russell and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]] attempted to solve these problems in ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' by putting statements into a hierarchy of [[type theory|types]], wherein a statement cannot refer to itself, but only to statements lower in the hierarchy.  This in turn led to new orders of difficulty regarding the precise natures of types and the structures of conceptually possible [[type system]]s that have yet to be resolved to this day.\n\n===Kripke's semantics<!--Linked from 'Semantic theory of truth'-->===\n{{Main|Kripke's theory of truth}}\n[[Kripke's theory of truth]] (named after [[Saul Kripke]]) contends that a natural language can in fact contain its own truth predicate without giving rise to contradiction. He showed how to construct one as follows:\n* Begin with a subset of sentences of a natural language that contains no occurrences of the expression \"is true\" (or \"is false\"). So ''The barn is big'' is included in the subset, but not \" ''The barn is big'' is true\", nor problematic sentences such as \"''This sentence'' is false\".\n* Define truth just for the sentences in that subset.\n* Then extend the definition of truth to include sentences that predicate truth or falsity of one of the original subset of sentences. So \"''The barn is big'' is true\" is now included, but not either \"''This sentence'' is false\" nor \"'''The barn is big'' is true' is true\".\n* Next, define truth for all sentences that predicate truth or falsity of a member of the second set. Imagine this process repeated infinitely, so that truth is defined for ''The barn is big''; then for \"''The barn is big'' is true\"; then for \"'''The barn is big'' is true' is true\", and so on.\n\nNotice that truth never gets defined for sentences like ''This sentence is false'', since it was not in the original subset and does not predicate truth of any sentence in the original or any subsequent set. In Kripke's terms, these are \"ungrounded.\" Since these sentences are never assigned either truth or falsehood even if the process is carried out infinitely, Kripke's theory implies that some sentences are neither true nor false. This contradicts the [[principle of bivalence]]: every sentence must be either true or false. Since this principle is a key premise in deriving the [[liar paradox]], the paradox is dissolved.<ref>Kripke, Saul. \"Outline of a Theory of Truth\", Journal of Philosophy, 72 (1975), 690\u2013716</ref>\n\nHowever, it has been [[Proof sketch for G\u00f6del's first incompleteness theorem|shown by G\u00f6del]] that self-reference cannot be avoided naively, since propositions about seemingly unrelated objects can have an informal self-referential meaning; in G\u00f6del's work, these objects are integer numbers, and they have an informal meaning regarding propositions. In fact, this idea\u2014manifested by the [[diagonal lemma]]\u2014is the basis for [[Tarski's undefinability theorem|Tarski's theorem]] that truth cannot be consistently defined.\n\nIt has thus been claimed<ref>Keith Simmons, ''Universality and the Liar: An Essay on Truth and the Diagonal Argument'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 1993</ref> that Kripke's system indeed leads to contradiction: while its truth predicate is only partial, it does give truth value (true/false) to propositions such as the one built in Tarski's proof, and is therefore inconsistent. While there is still a debate on whether Tarski's proof can be implemented to every similar partial truth system, none have been shown to be consistent by [[Consistency proof|acceptable methods]] used in [[mathematical logic]].\n\n==Folk beliefs==\nThe [[truth predicate]] \"''P'' is true\" has great practical value in human language, allowing us to ''efficiently'' endorse or impeach claims made by others, to emphasize the truth or falsity of a statement, or to enable various indirect ([[Gricean]]) conversational implications.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Scharp|first1=Kevin|title=Replacing truth|date=2013|publisher=Oxford Univ.

In his ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', Aristotle stated:  \"To say of what is that it is not, or of what is not that it is, is false, while to say of what is that it is, and of what is not that it is not, is true\".<ref name=StanfordCorr>David, Marion (2005). [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-correspondence/#1 \"Correspondence Theory of Truth\"] in [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]</ref> The [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] proceeds to say of Aristotle:\n\n<blockquote>[...] Aristotle sounds much more like a genuine correspondence theorist in the ''Categories'' (12b11, 14b14), where he talks of \"underlying things\" that make statements true and implies that these \"things\" (pragmata) are logically structured situations or facts (viz., his sitting, his not sitting). Most influential is his claim in ''De Interpretatione'' (16a3) that thoughts are \"likenesses\" (homoiosis) of things. Although he nowhere defines truth in terms of a thought's likeness to a thing or fact, it is clear that such a definition would fit well into his overall philosophy of mind. [...]<ref name=StanfordCorr/></blockquote>\n\nSimilar statements can also be found in Plato's dialogs (''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' 385b2, ''[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]'' 263b).<ref name=StanfordCorr/>\n\n====Religion====\n\nIn [[Hinduism]], Truth is defined as \"unchangeable\", \"that which has no distortion\", \"that which is beyond distinctions of time, space, and person\", \"that which pervades the universe in all its constancy\". The human body, therefore is not completely true as it changes with time, for example. There are many references, properties and explanations of truth by Hindu sages that explain varied facets of truth, such as the national motto of [[India]]: \"[[Satyameva Jayate]]\" (Truth alone wins), as well as \"Satyam muktaye\" (Truth liberates), \"Satya' is 'Parahit'artham' va'unmanaso yatha'rthatvam' satyam\" (Satya is the benevolent use of words and the mind for the welfare of others or in other words responsibilities is truth too), \"When one is firmly established in speaking truth, the fruits of action become subservient to him (patanjali yogasutras, sutra number 2.36), \"The face of truth is covered by a golden bowl. ''Unveil it, O Pusan (Sun), so that I who have truth as my duty (satyadharma) may see it!''\" (Brhadaranyaka V 15 1\u20134 and the brief IIsa Upanisad 15\u201318), Truth is superior to silence ([[Manusmriti]]), etc. Combined with other words, satya acts as modifier, like \"'''ultra'''\" or \"'''highest''',\" or more literally \"'''truest''',\" connoting '''purity and excellence'''. For example, satyaloka is the \"highest heaven' and Satya Yuga is the \"golden age\" or best of the four cyclical cosmic ages in Hinduism, and so on.\n\nIn [[Buddhism]], particularly in the [[Mahayana]] tradition, the notion of truth is often divided into the [[Two Truths Doctrine]], which consists of [[Samvriti|relative or conventional truth]] and ultimate truth. The former refers to truth that is based on common understanding aomng ordinary people and is accepted as a practical basis for communication of higher truths. Ultimate truth necessarily transcends logic in the sphere of ordinary experience, and recognizes such phenomena as illusory. [[M\u0101dhyamaka]] philosophy asserts that any doctrine can be analyzed with both divisions of truth. Affirmation and negation belong to relative and absolute truth respectively. Political law is regarded as relative, while religious law is absolute. \n\n[[Christianity]] has a [[Soteriology|soteriological]] view of truth. According to the [[Bible]] in [[John 14:6]], [[Jesus]] is quoted as having said \"I am the way, the truth and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me\".\n\n===Middle Ages===\n\n====Avicenna (980\u20131037)====\nIn [[early Islamic philosophy]], [[Avicenna]] (Ibn Sina) defined truth in his work [[Kitab Al-Shifa]] ''[[The Book of Healing]]'', Book I, Chapter 8, as:\n{{quote|What corresponds in the mind to what is outside it.<ref>Osman Amin (2007), \"Influence of Muslim Philosophy on the West\", ''Monthly Renaissance'' '''17''' (11).</ref>}}\n\n[[Avicenna]] elaborated on his definition of truth later in Book VIII, Chapter 6:\n{{Quote|The truth of a thing is the property of the being of each thing which has been established in it.<ref name=Aertsen>Jan A. Aertsen (1988), ''Nature and Creature: Thomas Aquinas's Way of Thought'', p. 152. Brill, {{ISBN|90-04-08451-7}}.</ref>}}\n\nHowever, this definition is merely a rendering of the [[medieval]] Latin translation of the work by Simone van Riet.<ref>{{cite book\n| author = Simone van Riet\n| title = Liber de philosophia prima, sive Scientia divina\n| page = 413\n| language = Latin}}</ref> A modern translation of the original Arabic text states:\n\n{{quote|Truth is also said of the veridical belief in the existence [of something].<ref>{{cite book\n| title = Avicenna: The Metaphysics of The Healing\n| publisher = Brigham Young University Press\n| year = 2005\n| page = 284\n| others = Michael E.

It is said to be true with respect to its conformity with the divine intellect insofar as it fulfills the end to which it was ordained by the divine intellect... With respect to its conformity with a human intellect, a thing is said to be true insofar as it is such as to cause a true estimate about itself.<ref>''Disputed Questions on Truth'', 1, 2, c, reply to Obj. 1. Trans. Mulligan, McGlynn, Schmidt, ''Truth'', vol. I, pp. 10\u201312.</ref>}}\n\nThus, for Aquinas, the truth of the human intellect (logical truth) is based on the truth in things (ontological truth).<ref>\"Veritas supra ens fundatur\" (Truth is founded on being). ''Disputed Questions on Truth'', 10, 2, reply to Obj. 3.</ref> Following this, he wrote an elegant re-statement of Aristotle's view in his [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1016.htm Summa I.16.1]:\n\n{{quote|Veritas est ad\u00e6quatio intellectus et rei. <br /> (Truth is the conformity of the intellect and things.)}}  Aquinas also said that real things participate in the act of being of the [[God|Creator God]] who is Subsistent Being, Intelligence, and Truth. Thus, these beings possess the light of intelligibility and are knowable. These things (beings; [[reality]]) are the foundation of the truth that is found in the human mind, when it acquires knowledge of things, first through the [[sense]]s, then through the [[understanding]] and the [[judgement]] done by [[reason]]. For Aquinas, human [[intelligence]] (\"intus\", within and \"legere\", to read) has the capability to reach the [[essence]] and [[existence]] of things because it has a non-material, [[Spirituality|spiritual]] element, although some moral, educational, and other elements might interfere with its capability.\n\n====Changing concepts of truth in the Middle Ages====\n[[Richard Firth Green]] examined the concept of truth in the later Middle Ages in his ''A Crisis of Truth'', and concludes that roughly during the reign of [[Richard II of England]] the very meaning of the concept changes.

Translated and edited by Paul Guyer and Allen W. Wood (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998), A58/B82.</ref> However, Kant denies that this correspondence definition of truth provides us with a test or criterion to establish which judgements are true. Kant states in his logic lectures:\n<blockquote>[...] Truth, it is said, consists in the agreement of cognition with its object. In consequence of this mere nominal definition, my cognition, to count as true, is supposed to agree with its object. Now I can compare the object with my cognition, however, only ''by cognizing it''.<!-- I wonder if the original had this cursive... --> Hence my cognition is supposed to confirm itself, which is far short of being sufficient for truth. For since the object is outside me, the cognition in me, all I can ever pass judgement on is whether my cognition of the object agrees with my cognition of the object.\n\nThe ancients called such a circle in explanation a ''diallelon''. And actually the logicians were always reproached with this mistake by the sceptics, who observed that with this definition of truth it is just as when someone makes a statement before a court and in doing so appeals to a witness with whom no one is acquainted, but who wants to establish his credibility by maintaining that the one who called him as witness is an honest man. The accusation was grounded, too. Only the solution of the indicated problem is impossible without qualification and for every man.

Michael Young (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992), pp. 557\u201358.</ref></blockquote>\nThis passage makes use of his distinction between nominal and real definitions. A nominal definition explains the meaning of a linguistic expression. A real definition describes the essence of certain [[Object (philosophy)|objects]] and enables us to determine whether any given item falls within the definition.<ref name = \"Vanzo-Kant\">Alberto Vanzo, \"Kant on the Nominal Definition of Truth\", ''Kant-Studien'', 101 (2010), pp. 147\u201366.</ref> Kant holds that the definition of truth is merely nominal and, therefore, we cannot employ it to establish which judgements are true. According to Kant, the ancient skeptics were critical of the logicians for holding that, by means of a merely nominal definition of truth, they can establish which judgements are true. They were trying to do something that is \"impossible without qualification and for every man\".<ref name = \"Kant-1801\" />\n\n====Hegel (1770\u20131831)====\n[[Georg Hegel]] distanced his philosophy from psychology by presenting truth as being an external self-moving object instead of being related to inner, subjective thoughts. Hegel's truth is analogous to the [[mechanics]] of a material body in motion under the influence of its own inner force. \"Truth is its own self-movement within itself.\"<ref>\"Die Wahrheit ist die Bewegung ihrer an ihr selbst.\" ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', Preface, \u00b6 48</ref> Teleological truth moves itself in the three-step form of [[Dialectic|dialectical triplicity]] toward the final goal of perfect, final, absolute truth. According to Hegel, the progression of philosophical truth is a resolution of past oppositions into increasingly more accurate approximations of absolute truth. [[Heinrich Moritz Chalyb\u00e4us|Chalyb\u00e4us]] used the terms \"[[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|thesis]]\", \"[[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|antithesis]]\", and \"[[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|synthesis]]\" to describe Hegel's dialectical triplicity.  The \"thesis\" consists of an incomplete historical movement. To resolve the incompletion, an \"antithesis\" occurs which opposes the \"thesis.\" In turn, the \"synthesis\" appears when the \"thesis\" and \"antithesis\" become [[Aufheben|reconciled]] and a higher level of truth is obtained. This \"synthesis\" thereby becomes a \"thesis,\" which will again necessitate an \"antithesis,\" requiring a new \"synthesis\" until a final state is reached as the result of reason's historical movement. History is the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute Spirit]] moving toward a goal. This historical progression will finally conclude itself when the Absolute Spirit understands its own infinite self at the very end of history. Absolute Spirit will then be the complete expression of an infinite [[God]].\n\n====Schopenhauer (1788\u20131860)====\nFor [[Arthur Schopenhauer]],<ref>''On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason'', \u00a7\u00a7 29\u201333</ref> a [[judgment]] is a combination or separation of two or more [[concept]]s. If a judgment is to be an expression of [[knowledge]], it must have a [[Principle of sufficient reason|sufficient reason]] or ground by which the judgment could be called true. ''Truth is the reference of a judgment to something different from itself which is its sufficient reason (ground)''. Judgments can have material, formal, transcendental, or metalogical truth. A judgment has ''material'' truth if its concepts are based on intuitive perceptions that are generated from sensations. If a judgment has its reason (ground) in another judgment, its truth is called logical or ''formal''. If a judgment, of, for example, pure mathematics or pure science, is based on the forms (space, time, causality) of intuitive, empirical knowledge, then the judgment has ''transcendental'' truth.\n\n====Kierkegaard (1813\u20131855)====\nWhen [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]], as his character ''Johannes Climacus'', ends his writings: ''My thesis was, subjectivity, heartfelt is the truth'', he does not advocate for [[subjectivism]] in its extreme form (the theory that something is true simply because one believes it to be so), but rather that the objective approach to matters of personal truth cannot shed any light upon that which is most essential to a person's life. Objective truths are concerned with the facts of a person's being, while subjective truths are concerned with a person's way of being. Kierkegaard agrees that objective truths for the study of subjects like mathematics, science, and history are relevant and necessary, but argues that objective truths do not shed any light on a person's inner relationship to existence. At best, these truths can only provide a severely narrowed perspective that has little to do with one's actual experience of life.<ref>Kierkegaard, S\u00f8ren. ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript''. Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1992</ref>\n\nWhile objective truths are final and static, subjective truths are continuing and dynamic. The truth of one's existence is a living, inward, and subjective experience that is always in the process of becoming. The values, morals, and spiritual approaches a person adopts, while not denying the existence of objective truths of those beliefs, can only become truly known when they have been inwardly appropriated through subjective experience. Thus, Kierkegaard criticizes all systematic philosophies which attempt to know life or the truth of existence via theories and objective knowledge about reality. As Kierkegaard claims, human truth is something that is continually occurring, and a human being cannot find truth separate from the subjective experience of one's own existing, defined by the values and fundamental essence that consist of one's way of life.<ref>Watts, Michael. ''Kierkegaard'', Oxford: Oneworld Publications, 2003</ref>\n\n====Nietzsche (1844\u20131900)====\n[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] believed the search for truth, or 'the will to truth', was a consequence of the ''[[will to power]]'' of philosophers. He thought that truth should be used as long as it promoted life and the ''will to power'', and he thought untruth was better than truth if it had this life enhancement as a consequence. As he wrote in ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'', \"The falseness of a judgment is to us not necessarily an objection to a judgment... The question is to what extent it is life-advancing, life-preserving, species-preserving, perhaps even species-breeding...\" (aphorism 4). He proposed the ''will to power'' as a truth only because, according to him, it was the most life-affirming and sincere perspective one could have.\n\nRobert Wicks discusses Nietzsche's basic view of truth as follows:\n<blockquote>[...] Some scholars regard Nietzsche's 1873 unpublished essay, \"On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense\" (\"\u00dcber Wahrheit und L\u00fcge im au\u00dfermoralischen Sinn\") as a keystone in his thought. In this essay, Nietzsche rejects the idea of universal constants, and claims that what we call \"truth\" is only \"a mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms.\" His view at this time is that arbitrariness completely prevails within human experience: concepts originate via the very artistic transference of nerve stimuli into images; \"truth\" is nothing more than the invention of fixed conventions for merely practical purposes, especially those of repose, security and consistence. [...]<ref>Robert Wicks, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche/#EarWri187187 Friedrich Nietzsche \u2013 Early Writings: 1872\u20131876], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy  (Spring 2008 Edition), Edward N.

According to [[Martin Heidegger]], the original meaning and [[essence]] of truth in [[Ancient Greece]] was unconcealment, or the revealing or bringing of what was previously hidden into the open, as indicated by the original Greek term for truth, ''[[aletheia]]''.<ref>http://aphelis.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Martin-Heidegger-On-the-Essence-of-Truth.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ontology.co/heidegger-aletheia.htm|title=Martin Heidegger on Aletheia (Truth) as Unconcealment|publisher=|access-date=2010-08-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626101634/http://www.ontology.co/heidegger-aletheia.htm|archive-date=2015-06-26|url-status=dead}}</ref> On this view, the conception of truth as correctness is a later derivation from the concept's original essence, a development Heidegger traces to the [[Latin]] term ''[[veritas]]''.\n\n====Whitehead (1861\u20131947)====\n[[Alfred North Whitehead]], a British mathematician who became an American philosopher, said: \"There are no whole truths; all truths are half-truths. It is trying to treat them as whole truths that plays the devil\".<ref>Alfred North Whitehead, ''Dialogues'', 1954: Prologue.</ref>\n\nThe logical progression or connection of this line of thought is to conclude that truth can lie, since [[half-truth]]s are deceptive and may lead to a false conclusion.\n\n====Peirce (1839\u20131914)====\n[[Pragmatists]] like [[C. S. Peirce]] take truth to have some manner of essential relation to human practices for inquiring into and [[discovering]] truth, with Peirce himself holding that truth is what human [[inquiry]] would find out on a matter, if our practice of inquiry were taken as far as it could profitably go: \"The opinion which is fated to be ultimately agreed to by all who investigate, is what we mean by the truth...\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peirce.org/writings/p119.html|title=How to Make Our Ideas Clear|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Nishida (1870\u20131945)====\nAccording to [[Kitaro Nishida]], \"knowledge of things in the world begins with the differentiation of unitary consciousness into knower and known and ends with self and things becoming one again. Such unification takes form not only in knowing but in the valuing (of truth) that directs knowing, the willing that directs action, and the feeling or emotive reach that directs sensing.\"<ref>John Maraldo, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nishida-kitaro/#2.2 Nishida Kitar\u00f4 \u2013 Self-Awareness], in: ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Spring 2005 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)</ref>\n\n====Fromm (1900\u20131980)====\n[[Erich Fromm]] finds that trying to discuss truth as \"absolute truth\" is sterile and that emphasis ought to be placed on \"optimal truth\". He considers truth as stemming from the survival imperative of grasping one's environment physically and intellectually, whereby young children instinctively seek truth so as to orient themselves in \"a strange and powerful world\". The accuracy of their perceived approximation of the truth will therefore have direct consequences on their ability to deal with their environment. Fromm can be understood to define truth as a functional approximation of reality. His vision of optimal truth is described partly in \"Man from Himself: An Inquiry into the Psychology of Ethics\" (1947), from which excerpts are included below.\n\n: the dichotomy between 'absolute = perfect' and 'relative = imperfect' has been superseded in all fields of scientific thought, where \"it is generally recognized that there is no absolute truth but nevertheless that there are objectively valid laws and principles\".\n\n: In that respect, \"a scientifically or rationally valid statement means that the power of reason is applied to all the available data of observation without any of them being suppressed or falsified for the sake of a desired result\". The history of science is \"a history of inadequate and incomplete statements, and every new insight makes possible the recognition of the inadequacies of previous propositions and offers a springboard for creating a more adequate formulation.\"\n\n: As a result \"the history of thought is the history of an ever-increasing approximation to the truth. Scientific knowledge is not absolute but optimal; it contains the optimum of truth attainable in a given historical period.\" Fromm furthermore notes that \"different cultures have emphasized various aspects of the truth\" and that increasing interaction between cultures allows for these aspects to reconcile and integrate, increasing further the approximation to the truth.\n\n====Foucault (1926\u20131984)====\n[[File:What-is-truth02.jpg|thumb|''[[John 18:38|Quid Est Veritas?]]'' [[Christ]] and [[Pilate]], by [[Nikolai Ge]].]]\n\nTruth, says [[Michel Foucault]], is problematic when any attempt is made to see truth as an \"objective\" quality.  He prefers not to use the term truth itself but \"Regimes of Truth\".  In his historical investigations he found truth to be something that was itself a part of, or embedded within, a given power structure.  Thus Foucault's view shares much in common with the concepts of [[Truth#Nietzsche|Nietzsche]].  Truth for Foucault is also something that shifts through various [[episteme]] throughout history.<ref>Foucault, M. \"The Order of Things\", London: Vintage Books, 1970 (1966)</ref>\n\n====Baudrillard (1929\u20132007)====\n[[Jean Baudrillard]] considered truth to be largely simulated, that is pretending to have something, as opposed to dissimulation, pretending to not have something.

The [[concept]] of truth is discussed and [[debate]]d in several contexts, including philosophy, art, theology, and science. Most human activities depend upon the concept, where its nature as a concept is assumed rather than being a subject of discussion; these include most of the [[science]]s, [[law]], [[journalism]], and everyday life. Some philosophers view the concept of truth as basic, and unable to be explained in any terms that are more easily understood than the concept of truth itself. To some, truth is viewed as the correspondence of [[language]] or [[thought]] to an independent [[reality]], in what is sometimes called the [[correspondence theory of truth]].\n\nVarious theories and views of truth continue to be debated among scholars, philosophers, and theologians.<ref name=PUP32014>{{cite book|author1=Alexis G.

The method used to determine whether something is a truth is termed a [[criteria of truth|criterion of truth]]. There are varying stances on such questions as what constitutes truth: what things are [[truthbearer]]s capable of being true or false; how to define, identify, and distinguish truth; what roles do faith and empirical knowledge play; and whether truth can be [[Subjectivity|subjective]] or if it is [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] (in other words, [[knowledge relativity|relative truth]] versus [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute truth]]).\n\n==Definition and etymology==\n{{Further|Veritas|Aletheia|Tryggvi}}\n{{anchor|treowe}}\n[[File:An angel carrying the banner of \"Truth\", Roslin, Midlothian.JPG|thumb|left|An angel carrying the banner of \"Truth\", [[Roslin, Midlothian]]]]\nThe English word ''[[:wikt:truth|truth]]'' is derived from [[Old English]] ''tr\u00edew\u00fe, tr\u00e9ow\u00fe, tr\u00fdw\u00fe'', [[Middle English]] ''trew\u00fee'', cognate to [[Old High German]] ''triuwida'', [[Old Norse]] ''trygg\u00f0''.

To express \"factuality\", [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] opted for nouns derived from ''sanna'' \"to assert, affirm\", while continental [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] (German and Dutch) opted for continuations of ''w\u00e2ra'' \"faith, trust, pact\" (cognate to Slavic ''v\u011bra'' \"(religious) faith\", but influenced by Latin ''[[veritas|verus]]'').

Each presents perspectives that are widely shared by published scholars.<ref name=\"EPT\">[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Supp., \"Truth\", auth: Michael Williams, pp. 572\u201373 (Macmillan, 1996)</ref><ref>Blackburn, Simon, and Simmons, Keith (eds., 1999), ''Truth'', Oxford University Press, Oxford.

More recently developed \"[[deflationary theory of truth|deflationary]]\" or \"minimalist\" theories of truth have emerged as possible alternatives to the most prevalent substantive theories. Minimalist reasoning centres around the notion that the application of a term like ''true'' to a statement does not assert anything significant about it, for instance, anything about its ''nature''. Minimalist reasoning realises ''truth'' as a label utilised in general discourse to express agreement, to stress claims, or to form general assumptions.<ref name = EPT/><ref>Horwich, Paul, ''Truth'', (2nd edition, 1988),</ref><ref>Field, Hartry, ''Truth and the Absence of Fact'' (2001).</ref>\n\n===Substantive===\n====Correspondence====\n{{Main|Correspondence theory of truth}}\nCorrespondence theories emphasise that true beliefs and true statements correspond to the actual state of affairs.<ref>[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, \"Correspondence Theory of Truth\", auth.: [[Arthur N. Prior]], p. 223 (Macmillan, 1969). Prior uses [[Bertrand Russell]]'s wording in defining correspondence theory. According to Prior, Russell was substantially responsible for helping to make correspondence theory widely known under this name.</ref> This type of theory stresses a relationship between thoughts or statements on one hand, and things or objects on the other. It is a traditional model tracing its origins to [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] philosophers such as [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]].<ref>[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, \"Correspondence Theory of Truth\", auth.: Arthur N. Prior, pp. 223\u201324 (Macmillan, 1969).</ref> This class of theories holds that the truth or the falsity of a representation is determined in principle entirely by how it relates to \"things\" by whether it accurately describes those \"things\". A classic example of correspondence theory is the statement by the thirteenth century philosopher and theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]]: \"[[Veritas est adaequatio rei et intellectus]]\" (\"Truth is the adequation of things and [[intellect]]\"), which Aquinas attributed to the ninth century [[Neoplatonist]] [[Isaac Israeli ben Solomon|Isaac Israeli]].<ref>[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol. 2, \"Correspondence Theory of Truth\", auth.: Arthur N. Prior, Macmillan, 1969, p. 224.</ref><ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-correspondence \"Correspondence Theory of Truth\", in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy].</ref><ref>Thomas Aquinas, ''[[Summa Theologiae]]'', I. Q.16, A.2 arg. 2.</ref> Aquinas also restated the theory as: \"A judgment is said to be true when it conforms to the external reality\".<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-correspondence \"Correspondence Theory of Truth\", in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy] (citing ''De Veritate'' Q.1, A.1\u20133 and ''[[Summa Theologiae]]'', I. Q.16).</ref>\n\nCorrespondence theory centres heavily around the assumption that truth is a matter of accurately copying what is known as \"[[objective reality]]\" and then representing it in thoughts, words and other symbols.<ref>''See, e.g.,'' Bradley, F.H., \"On Truth and Copying\", in Blackburn, ''et al.'' (eds., 1999),''Truth'', 31\u201345.</ref> Many modern theorists have stated that this ideal cannot be achieved without analysing additional factors.<ref name=EPT/><ref>[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, \"Correspondence Theory of Truth\", auth: Arthur N. Prior, pp. 223 ''ff''. Macmillan, 1969. See especially, section on \"Moore's Correspondence Theory\", 225\u201326, \"Russell's Correspondence Theory\", 226\u201327, \"Remsey and Later Wittgenstein\", 228\u201329, \"Tarski's Semantic Theory\", 230\u201331.</ref> For example, language plays a role in that all languages have words to represent concepts that are virtually undefined in other languages. The [[German language|German]] word ''[[Zeitgeist]]'' is one such example: one who speaks or understands the language may \"know\" what it means, but any translation of the word apparently fails to accurately capture its full meaning (this is a problem with many abstract words, especially those derived in [[agglutinative languages]]). Thus, some words add an additional parameter to the construction of an accurate [[truth predicate]]. Among the philosophers who grappled with this problem is [[Alfred Tarski]], whose [[semantic theory of truth|semantic theory]] is summarized further below in this article.<ref>[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, \"Correspondence Theory of Truth\", auth: Arthur N. Prior, pp. 223 ''ff''. Macmillan, 1969. See the section on \"Tarski's Semantic Theory\", 230\u201331.</ref>\n\nProponents of several of the theories below have gone further to assert that there are yet other issues necessary to the analysis, such as interpersonal power struggles, community interactions, personal biases and other factors involved in deciding what is seen as truth.\n\n====Coherence====\n{{Main|Coherence theory of truth}}\n[[File:Statue of Truth.jpg|thumb|left|[[Walter Seymour Allward]]'s ''Veritas'' (Truth) outside [[Supreme Court of Canada]], [[Ottawa, Ontario]] [[Canada]]]]\n\nFor coherence theories in general, truth requires a proper fit of elements within a whole system. Very often, though, coherence is taken to imply something more than simple logical consistency; often there is a demand that the propositions in a coherent system lend mutual inferential support to each other. So, for example, the completeness and comprehensiveness of the underlying set of concepts is a critical factor in judging the validity and usefulness of a coherent system.<ref>[[Immanuel Kant]], for instance, assembled a controversial but quite coherent system in the early 19th century, whose validity and usefulness continues to be debated even today. Similarly, the systems of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[Spinoza]] are characteristic systems that are internally coherent but controversial in terms of their utility and validity.</ref>  A pervasive tenet of coherence theories is the idea that truth is primarily a property of whole systems of propositions, and can be ascribed to individual propositions only according to their coherence with the whole.  Among the assortment of perspectives commonly regarded as coherence theory, theorists differ on the question of whether coherence entails many possible true systems of thought or only a single absolute system.\n\nSome variants of coherence theory are claimed to describe the essential and intrinsic properties of [[formal system]]s in logic and mathematics.<ref>[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, \"Coherence Theory of Truth\", auth: Alan R. White, pp. 130\u201331 (Macmillan, 1969)</ref>  However, formal reasoners are content to contemplate [[independence (mathematical logic)|axiomatically independent]] and sometimes mutually contradictory systems side by side, for example, the various [[noneuclidean geometry|alternative geometries]]. On the whole, coherence theories have been rejected for lacking justification in their application to other areas of truth, especially with respect to assertions about the [[Natural environment|natural world]], [[empirical]] data in general, assertions about practical matters of psychology and society, especially when used without support from the other major theories of truth.<ref>[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, \"Coherence Theory of Truth\", auth: Alan R. White, pp. 131\u201333, ''see'' esp., section on \"Epistemological assumptions\" (Macmillan, 1969)</ref>\n\nCoherence theories distinguish the thought of [[rationalism|rationalist]] philosophers, particularly of [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], along with the British philosopher [[F. H. Bradley]].<ref>[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, \"Coherence Theory of Truth\", auth: Alan R. White, p. 130</ref>  They have found a resurgence also among several proponents of [[logical positivism]], notably [[Otto Neurath]] and [[Carl Hempel]].\n\n====Pragmatic====\n{{Main|Pragmatic theory of truth}}\n\nThe three most influential forms of the ''pragmatic theory of truth'' were introduced around the turn of the 20th century by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]], and [[John Dewey]].  Although there are wide differences in viewpoint among these and other proponents of pragmatic theory, they hold in common that truth is verified and confirmed by the results of putting one's concepts into practice.<ref>[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol. 5, \"Pragmatic Theory of Truth\", 427 (Macmillan, 1969).</ref>\n\n[[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]] defines truth as follows:  \"Truth is that concordance of an abstract statement with the ideal limit towards which endless investigation would tend to bring scientific belief, which concordance the abstract statement may possess by virtue of the confession of its inaccuracy and one-sidedness, and this confession is an essential ingredient of truth.\"<ref name=\"Peirce Truth and Falsity\">Peirce, C.S. (1901), \"Truth and Falsity and Error\" (in part), pp. 716\u201320 in [[James Mark Baldwin]], ed., ''Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology'', v. 2. Peirce's section is entitled \"''Logical''\", beginning on p. 718, column 1, and ending on p. 720 with the initials \"(C.S.P.)\", see Google Books [https://archive.org/details/beginningthirdr00randgoog/page/n748 <!-- pg=718 --> Eprint]. Reprinted, ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers]]'' v. 5, pp. 565\u201373.</ref>  This statement stresses Peirce's view that ideas of approximation, incompleteness, and partiality, what he describes elsewhere as ''[[fallibilism]]'' and \"reference to the future\", are essential to a proper conception of truth.  Although Peirce uses words like ''concordance'' and ''correspondence'' to describe one aspect of the pragmatic [[sign relation]], he is also quite explicit in saying that definitions of truth based on mere correspondence are no more than ''nominal'' definitions, which he accords a lower status than ''real'' definitions.\n\n[[William James]]'s version of pragmatic theory, while complex, is often summarized by his statement that \"the 'true' is only the expedient in our way of thinking, just as the 'right' is only the expedient in our way of behaving.\"<ref name=WJP>James, William, ''The Meaning of Truth, A Sequel to 'Pragmatism','' (1909).</ref>  By this, James meant that truth is a ''quality'', the value of which is confirmed by its effectiveness when applying concepts to practice (thus, \"pragmatic\").\n\n[[John Dewey]], less broadly than James but more broadly than Peirce, held that [[inquiry]], whether scientific, technical, sociological, philosophical or cultural, is self-corrective over time ''if''  openly submitted for testing by a community of inquirers in order to clarify, justify, refine and/or refute proposed truths.<ref>[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, \"Dewey, John\", auth [[Richard J. Bernstein]], p. 383 (Macmillan, 1969)</ref>\n\nThough not widely known, a new variation of the pragmatic theory was defined and wielded successfully from the 20th century forward. Defined and named by [[William Ernest Hocking]], this variation is known as \"negative pragmatism\".  Essentially, what works may or may not be true, but what fails cannot be true because the truth always works.<ref>Sahakian, W.S. & Sahakian, M.L., Ideas of the Great Philosophers, New York: Barnes & Noble, 1966, {{LCCN|66-23155}}</ref> [[Richard Feynman]] also ascribed to it: \"We never are definitely right, we can only be sure we are wrong.\"<ref name=\"FeynmanThe\">Feynman, The Character of Physical Law, New York: Random House, 1994, {{ISBN|0-679-60127-9}}.</ref> This approach incorporates many of the ideas from Peirce, James, and Dewey.  For Peirce, the idea of \"... endless investigation would tend to bring about scientific belief ...\" fits negative pragmatism in that a negative pragmatist would never stop testing.  As Feynman noted, an idea or theory \"... could never be proved right, because tomorrow's experiment might succeed in proving wrong what you thought was right.\"<ref name=\"FeynmanThe\" />  Similarly, James and Dewey's ideas also ascribe truth to repeated testing which is \"self-corrective\" over time.\n\nPragmatism and negative pragmatism are also closely aligned with the [[coherence theory of truth]] in that any testing should not be isolated but rather incorporate knowledge from all human endeavors and experience.  The universe is a whole and integrated system, and testing should acknowledge and account for its diversity.  As Feynman said, \"... if it disagrees with experiment, it is wrong.\"<ref>Feynman, ''The Character of Physical Law'', p. 150.</ref>\n\n====Constructivist====\n{{Main|Constructivist epistemology}}\n\n[[Constructivist epistemology|Social constructivism]] holds that truth is constructed by social processes, is historically and culturally specific, and that it is in part shaped through the power struggles within a community. Constructivism views all of our knowledge as \"constructed,\" because it does not reflect any external \"transcendent\" realities (as a pure correspondence theory might hold).  Rather, perceptions of truth are viewed as contingent on convention, human perception, and social experience. It is believed by constructivists that representations of physical and biological reality, including [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], and [[gender]], are socially constructed.\n\n[[Giambattista Vico]] was among the first to claim that history and culture were man-made. Vico's [[epistemology|epistemological]] orientation gathers the most diverse rays and unfolds in one axiom\u2014''verum ipsum factum''\u2014\"truth itself is constructed\". [[Hegel]] and [[Marx]] were among the other early proponents of the premise that truth is, or can be, socially constructed. Marx, like many critical theorists who followed, did not reject the existence of objective truth but rather distinguished between true knowledge and knowledge that has been distorted through power or ideology. For Marx, scientific and true knowledge is \"in accordance with the dialectical understanding of history\" and ideological knowledge is \"an epiphenomenal expression of the relation of material forces in a given economic arrangement\".<ref>{{cite book |author1=May, Todd |authorlink1=Todd May |title=Between Genealogy and Epistemology: Psychology, Politics, and Knowledge in the Thought of Michel Foucault |date=1993 |publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press |location=University Park |isbn=978-0271027821|oclc= 26553016|page= }}</ref>{{page needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n====Consensus====\n{{Main|Consensus theory of truth}}\n\n[[Consensus theory of truth|Consensus theory]] holds that truth is whatever is agreed upon, or in some versions, might come to be agreed upon, by some specified group. Such a group might include all human beings, or a [[subset]] thereof consisting of more than one person.\n\nAmong the current advocates of consensus theory as a useful accounting of the concept of \"truth\" is the philosopher [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]].<ref>''See, e.g.'', Habermas, J\u00fcrgen, ''Knowledge and Human Interests'' (English translation, 1972).</ref> Habermas maintains that truth is what would be agreed upon in an [[ideal speech situation]].<ref>''See, e.g.'', Habermas, J\u00fcrgen, ''Knowledge and Human Interests'' (English translation, 1972), esp. Part III, pp. 187 ''ff''.</ref> Among the current strong critics of consensus theory is the philosopher [[Nicholas Rescher]].<ref>Rescher, Nicholas, ''Pluralism: Against the Demand for Consensus'' (1995).</ref>\n\nIn the Islamic tradition, this principle is exemplified by the [[hadith]] in which [[Muhammad]] states, \"My [[ummah|community]] will never agree upon an error\"<ref>Narrated by [http://sunnah.com/tirmidhi/33/10 al-Tirmidhi (4:2167)], ibn Majah (2:1303), Abu Dawood, and others with slightly different wordings.</ref>\n\n===Minimalist===\n====Deflationary====\n{{Main|Deflationary theory of truth}}\n\nModern developments in the field of philosophy, starting with the relatively modern notion that a theory being old does not necessarily imply that it is completely flawless, have resulted in the rise of a new thesis: that the term ''truth'' does not denote a real property of sentences or propositions. This thesis is in part a response to the common use of ''truth predicates'' (e.g., that some particular thing \"...is true\") which was particularly prevalent in philosophical discourse on truth in the first half of the 20th century.  From this point of view, to assert that \"'2 + 2 = 4' is true\" is logically equivalent to asserting that \"2 + 2 = 4\", and the phrase \"is true\" is completely dispensable in this and every other context. In common parlance, truth predicates are not commonly heard, and it would be interpreted as an unusual occurrence were someone to utilise a truth predicate in an everyday conversation when asserting that something is true. Newer perspectives that take this discrepancy into account and work with sentence structures that are actually employed in common discourse can be broadly described:\n* as ''deflationary'' theories of truth, since they attempt to deflate the presumed importance of the words \"true\" or ''truth'',\n* as ''disquotational'' theories, to draw attention to the disappearance of the quotation marks in cases like the above example, or\n* as ''minimalist'' theories of truth.<ref name=EPT/><ref>Blackburn, Simon, and Simmons, Keith (eds., 1999), ''Truth'' in the Introductory section of the book.</ref>\n\nWhichever term is used, deflationary theories can be said to hold in common that \"[t]he predicate 'true' is an expressive convenience, not the name of a property requiring deep analysis.\"<ref name=EPT/> Once we have identified the truth predicate's formal features and utility, deflationists argue, we have said all there is to be said about truth. Among the theoretical concerns of these views is to explain away those special cases where it ''does'' appear that the concept of truth has peculiar and interesting properties. (See, e.g., [[Semantic paradox]]es, and below.)\n\nIn addition to highlighting such formal aspects of the predicate \"is true\", some deflationists point out that the concept enables us to express things that might otherwise require infinitely long sentences. For example, one cannot express confidence in Michael's accuracy by asserting the endless sentence:\n:''Michael says, 'snow is white' and snow is white, or he says 'roses are red' and roses are red or he says ... etc.''\nThis assertion can also be succinctly expressed by saying: ''What Michael says is true''.<ref>[[Richard Kirkham]], [[Theories of Truth: A Critical Introduction]], MIT Press, 1992.</ref>\n\n====Performative====\nAttributed to [[P. F. Strawson]] is the performative theory of truth which holds that to say \"'Snow is white' is true\" is to perform the [[speech act]] of signaling one's agreement with the claim that snow is white (much like nodding one's head in agreement). The idea that some statements are more actions than communicative statements is not as odd as it may seem. Consider, for example, that when the wedding couple say \"I do\" at the appropriate time in a wedding, they are performing the act of taking the other to be their lawful wedded spouse. They are not ''describing'' themselves as taking the other, but actually ''doing'' so (perhaps the most thorough analysis of such \"illocutionary acts\" is [[J. L. Austin]], \"[[How to Do Things With Words]]\"<ref>J. L. Austin, \"How to Do Things With Words\". Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1975</ref>).\n\nStrawson holds that a similar analysis is applicable to all speech acts, not just illocutionary ones: \"To say a statement is true is not to make a statement about a statement, but rather to perform the act of agreeing with, accepting, or endorsing a statement.  When one says 'It's true that it's raining,' one asserts no more than 'It's raining.'  The function of [the statement] 'It's true that...' is to agree with, accept, or endorse the statement that 'it's raining.'\"<ref>[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol. 6: ''Performative Theory of Truth'', auth: Gertrude Ezorsky, p. 88 (Macmillan, 1969)</ref>\n\n====Redundancy and related====\n{{Main|Redundancy theory of truth}}\n\nAccording to the [[redundancy theory of truth]], asserting that a statement is true is completely equivalent to asserting the statement itself.  For example, making the assertion that \"&nbsp;'Snow is white' is true\" is equivalent to asserting \"Snow is white\".  Redundancy theorists infer from this premise that truth is a redundant concept; that is, it is merely a word that is traditionally used in conversation or writing, generally for emphasis, but not a word that actually equates to anything in reality.  This theory is commonly attributed to [[Frank P. Ramsey]], who held that the use of words like ''fact'' and ''truth'' was nothing but a [[periphrasis|roundabout]] way of asserting a proposition, and that treating these words as separate problems in isolation from judgment was merely a \"linguistic muddle\".<ref name=\"EPT\"/><ref>Ramsey, F.P. (1927), \"Facts and Propositions\", Aristotelian Society Supplementary Volume 7, 153\u201370. Reprinted, pp. 34\u201351 in F.P. Ramsey, Philosophical Papers, David Hugh Mellor (ed.), Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1990</ref><ref>Le Morvan, Pierre. (2004) \"Ramsey on Truth and Truth on Ramsey\", ''The British Journal for the History of Philosophy'' 12(4), pp. 705\u201318.</ref>\n\nA variant of redundancy theory is the disquotational theory which uses a modified form of [[Alfred Tarski|Tarski]]'s [[Truth#Semantic theory of truth|schema]]: To say that '\"P\" is true' is to say that P.  A version of this theory was defended by [[C. J. F. Williams]] in his book ''What is Truth?''  Yet another version of deflationism is the prosentential theory of truth, first developed by Dorothy Grover, Joseph Camp, and [[Nuel Belnap]] as an elaboration of Ramsey's claims.  They argue that sentences like \"That's true\", when said in response to \"It's raining\", are [[prosentence]]s, expressions that merely repeat the content of other expressions.  In the same way that ''it'' means the same as ''my dog'' in the sentence ''My dog was hungry, so I fed it'', ''That's true'' is supposed to mean the same as ''It's raining''\u2014if you say the latter and I then say the former.  These variations do not necessarily follow Ramsey in asserting that truth is ''not'' a property, but rather can be understood to say that, for instance, the assertion \"P\" may well involve a substantial truth, and the theorists in this case are minimizing only the redundancy or prosentence involved in the statement such as \"that's true.\"<ref name=EPT/>\n\nDeflationary principles do not apply to representations that are not analogous to sentences, and also do not apply to many other things that are commonly judged to be true or otherwise.  Consider the analogy between the sentence \"Snow is white\" and the character named Snow White, both of which can be true in some sense.  To a minimalist, saying \"Snow is white is true\" is the same as saying \"Snow is white,\" but to say \"Snow White is true\" is ''not'' the same as saying \"Snow White.\"\n\n====Philosophical skepticism====\n{{see also|Philosophical skepticism|Certainty}}\n\n[[Philosophical skepticism]] is generally any questioning attitude or [[doubt]] towards one or more items of [[knowledge]] or [[belief]] which ascribe truth to their assertions and propositions.<ref>{{cite book |first=R.

Pluralist theories of truth assert that there may be more than one property that makes propositions true: ethical propositions might be true by virtue of coherence. Propositions about the physical world might be true by corresponding to the objects and properties they are about.\n\nSome of the pragmatic theories, such as those by [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles Peirce]] and [[William James]], included aspects of correspondence, coherence and constructivist theories.<ref name=\"Peirce Truth and Falsity\"/><ref name=WJP/> [[Crispin Wright]] argued in his 1992 book ''Truth and Objectivity'' that any predicate which satisfied certain platitudes about truth qualified as a truth predicate.

Here he restricted it in this way: no language could contain its own truth predicate, that is, the expression ''is true'' could only apply to sentences in some other language. The latter he called an ''object language'', the language being talked about. (It may, in turn, have a truth predicate that can be applied to sentences in still another language.) The reason for his restriction was that languages that contain their own truth predicate will contain [[Liar paradox|paradoxical]] sentences such as, \"This sentence is not true\". As a result, Tarski held that the semantic theory could not be applied to any natural language, such as English, because they contain their own truth predicates. [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] used it as the foundation of his [[truth-conditional semantics]] and linked it to [[radical interpretation]] in a form of [[coherentism]].\n\n[[Bertrand Russell]] is credited with noticing the existence of such paradoxes even in the best symbolic formations of mathematics in his day, in particular the paradox that came to be named after him, [[Russell's paradox]]. Russell and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]] attempted to solve these problems in ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' by putting statements into a hierarchy of [[type theory|types]], wherein a statement cannot refer to itself, but only to statements lower in the hierarchy.  This in turn led to new orders of difficulty regarding the precise natures of types and the structures of conceptually possible [[type system]]s that have yet to be resolved to this day.\n\n===Kripke's semantics<!--Linked from 'Semantic theory of truth'-->===\n{{Main|Kripke's theory of truth}}\n[[Kripke's theory of truth]] (named after [[Saul Kripke]]) contends that a natural language can in fact contain its own truth predicate without giving rise to contradiction. He showed how to construct one as follows:\n* Begin with a subset of sentences of a natural language that contains no occurrences of the expression \"is true\" (or \"is false\"). So ''The barn is big'' is included in the subset, but not \" ''The barn is big'' is true\", nor problematic sentences such as \"''This sentence'' is false\".\n* Define truth just for the sentences in that subset.\n* Then extend the definition of truth to include sentences that predicate truth or falsity of one of the original subset of sentences. So \"''The barn is big'' is true\" is now included, but not either \"''This sentence'' is false\" nor \"'''The barn is big'' is true' is true\".\n* Next, define truth for all sentences that predicate truth or falsity of a member of the second set. Imagine this process repeated infinitely, so that truth is defined for ''The barn is big''; then for \"''The barn is big'' is true\"; then for \"'''The barn is big'' is true' is true\", and so on.\n\nNotice that truth never gets defined for sentences like ''This sentence is false'', since it was not in the original subset and does not predicate truth of any sentence in the original or any subsequent set. In Kripke's terms, these are \"ungrounded.\" Since these sentences are never assigned either truth or falsehood even if the process is carried out infinitely, Kripke's theory implies that some sentences are neither true nor false. This contradicts the [[principle of bivalence]]: every sentence must be either true or false. Since this principle is a key premise in deriving the [[liar paradox]], the paradox is dissolved.<ref>Kripke, Saul. \"Outline of a Theory of Truth\", Journal of Philosophy, 72 (1975), 690\u2013716</ref>\n\nHowever, it has been [[Proof sketch for G\u00f6del's first incompleteness theorem|shown by G\u00f6del]] that self-reference cannot be avoided naively, since propositions about seemingly unrelated objects can have an informal self-referential meaning; in G\u00f6del's work, these objects are integer numbers, and they have an informal meaning regarding propositions. In fact, this idea\u2014manifested by the [[diagonal lemma]]\u2014is the basis for [[Tarski's undefinability theorem|Tarski's theorem]] that truth cannot be consistently defined.\n\nIt has thus been claimed<ref>Keith Simmons, ''Universality and the Liar: An Essay on Truth and the Diagonal Argument'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 1993</ref> that Kripke's system indeed leads to contradiction: while its truth predicate is only partial, it does give truth value (true/false) to propositions such as the one built in Tarski's proof, and is therefore inconsistent.

In his ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', Aristotle stated:  \"To say of what is that it is not, or of what is not that it is, is false, while to say of what is that it is, and of what is not that it is not, is true\".<ref name=StanfordCorr>David, Marion (2005). [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-correspondence/#1 \"Correspondence Theory of Truth\"] in [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]</ref> The [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] proceeds to say of Aristotle:\n\n<blockquote>[...] Aristotle sounds much more like a genuine correspondence theorist in the ''Categories'' (12b11, 14b14), where he talks of \"underlying things\" that make statements true and implies that these \"things\" (pragmata) are logically structured situations or facts (viz., his sitting, his not sitting). Most influential is his claim in ''De Interpretatione'' (16a3) that thoughts are \"likenesses\" (homoiosis) of things. Although he nowhere defines truth in terms of a thought's likeness to a thing or fact, it is clear that such a definition would fit well into his overall philosophy of mind. [...]<ref name=StanfordCorr/></blockquote>\n\nSimilar statements can also be found in Plato's dialogs (''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' 385b2, ''[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]'' 263b).<ref name=StanfordCorr/>\n\n====Religion====\n\nIn [[Hinduism]], Truth is defined as \"unchangeable\", \"that which has no distortion\", \"that which is beyond distinctions of time, space, and person\", \"that which pervades the universe in all its constancy\". The human body, therefore is not completely true as it changes with time, for example. There are many references, properties and explanations of truth by Hindu sages that explain varied facets of truth, such as the national motto of [[India]]: \"[[Satyameva Jayate]]\" (Truth alone wins), as well as \"Satyam muktaye\" (Truth liberates), \"Satya' is 'Parahit'artham' va'unmanaso yatha'rthatvam' satyam\" (Satya is the benevolent use of words and the mind for the welfare of others or in other words responsibilities is truth too), \"When one is firmly established in speaking truth, the fruits of action become subservient to him ( patanjali yogasutras, sutra number 2.36 ), \"The face of truth is covered by a golden bowl. ''Unveil it, O Pusan (Sun), so that I who have truth as my duty (satyadharma) may see it!''\" (Brhadaranyaka V 15 1\u20134 and the brief IIsa Upanisad 15\u201318), Truth is superior to silence ([[Manusmriti]]), etc. Combined with other words, satya acts as modifier, like \"'''ultra'''\" or \"'''highest''',\" or more literally \"'''truest''',\" connoting '''purity and excellence'''. For example, satyaloka is the \"highest heaven' and Satya Yuga is the \"golden age\" or best of the four cyclical cosmic ages in Hinduism, and so on.\n\nIn [[Buddhism]], particularly in the [[Mahayana]] tradition, the notion of truth is often divided into the [[Two Truths Doctrine]], which consists of [[Samvriti|relative or conventional truth]] and ultimate truth. The former refers to truth that is based on common understanding aomng ordinary people and is accepted as a practical basis for communication of higher truths. Ultimate truth necessarily transcends logic in the sphere of ordinary experience, and recognizes such phenomena as illusory. [[M\u0101dhyamaka]] philosophy asserts that any doctrine can be analyzed with both divisions of truth. Affirmation and negation belong to relative and absolute truth respectively. Political law is regarded as relative, while religious law is absolute. \n\n[[Christianity]] has a [[Soteriology|soteriological]] view of truth. According to the [[Bible]] in [[John 14:6]], [[Jesus]] is quoted as having said \"I am the way, the truth and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me\".\n\n===Middle Ages===\n\n====Avicenna (980\u20131037)====\nIn [[early Islamic philosophy]], [[Avicenna]] (Ibn Sina) defined truth in his work [[Kitab Al-Shifa]] ''[[The Book of Healing]]'', Book I, Chapter 8, as:\n{{quote|What corresponds in the mind to what is outside it.<ref>Osman Amin (2007), \"Influence of Muslim Philosophy on the West\", ''Monthly Renaissance'' '''17''' (11).</ref>}}\n\n[[Avicenna]] elaborated on his definition of truth later in Book VIII, Chapter 6:\n{{Quote|The truth of a thing is the property of the being of each thing which has been established in it.<ref name=Aertsen>Jan A. Aertsen (1988), ''Nature and Creature: Thomas Aquinas's Way of Thought'', p. 152.

It is said to be true with respect to its conformity with the divine intellect insofar as it fulfills the end to which it was ordained by the divine intellect... With respect to its conformity with a human intellect, a thing is said to be true insofar as it is such as to cause a true estimate about itself.<ref>''Disputed Questions on Truth'', 1, 2, c, reply to Obj. 1. Trans. Mulligan, McGlynn, Schmidt, ''Truth'', vol. I, pp. 10\u201312.</ref>}}\n\nThus, for Aquinas, the truth of the human intellect (logical truth) is based on the truth in things (ontological truth).<ref>\"Veritas supra ens fundatur\" (Truth is founded on being). ''Disputed Questions on Truth'', 10, 2, reply to Obj. 3.</ref> Following this, he wrote an elegant re-statement of Aristotle's view in his [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1016.htm Summa I.16.1]:\n\n{{quote|Veritas est ad\u00e6quatio intellectus et rei. <br /> (Truth is the conformity of the intellect and things.)}}  Aquinas also said that real things participate in the act of being of the [[God|Creator God]] who is Subsistent Being, Intelligence, and Truth. Thus, these beings possess the light of intelligibility and are knowable. These things (beings; [[reality]]) are the foundation of the truth that is found in the human mind, when it acquires knowledge of things, first through the [[sense]]s, then through the [[understanding]] and the [[judgement]] done by [[reason]]. For Aquinas, human [[intelligence]] (\"intus\", within and \"legere\", to read) has the capability to reach the [[essence]] and [[existence]] of things because it has a non-material, [[Spirituality|spiritual]] element, although some moral, educational, and other elements might interfere with its capability.\n\n====Changing concepts of truth in the Middle Ages====\n[[Richard Firth Green]] examined the concept of truth in the later Middle Ages in his ''A Crisis of Truth'', and concludes that roughly during the reign of [[Richard II of England]] the very meaning of the concept changes. The idea of the oath, which was so much part and parcel of for instance [[Romance (heroic literature)|Romance literature]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rock|first=Catherine A.|year=2006|title=Forsworn and Fordone: Arcite as Oath-Breaker in the \"Knight's Tale\"|journal=[[The Chaucer Review]]|volume=40|issue=4|pages=416\u201332|jstor=25094334|doi=10.1353/cr.2006.0009}}</ref> changes from a subjective concept to a more objective one (in [[Derek Pearsall]]'s summary).<ref name=pearsall>{{cite journal|last=Pearsall|first=Derek|year=2004|title=Medieval Literature and Historical Enquiry|journal=[[Modern Language Review]]|volume=99|issue=4|pages=xxxi\u2013xlii|jstor=3738608|doi=10.2307/3738608}}</ref> Whereas truth (the \"trouthe\" of ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'') was first \"an ethical truth in which truth is understood to reside in persons\", in Ricardian England it \"transforms...into a [[political truth]] in which truth is understood to reside in documents\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fowler|first=Elizabeth|year=2003|title=Rev. of Green, ''A Crisis of Truth''|journal=[[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]]|volume=78|issue=1|pages=179\u201382|jstor=3301477|doi=10.1017/S0038713400099310}}</ref>\n\n===Modern age===\n\n====Kant (1724\u20131804)====\n[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|[[Immanuel Kant]]]]\n\n[[Immanuel Kant]] endorses a definition of truth along the lines of the correspondence theory of truth.<ref name=StanfordCorr/> Kant writes in the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'': \"The nominal definition of truth, namely that it is the agreement of cognition with its object, is here granted and presupposed\".<ref name = \"Kant-1781\">Kant, Immanuel (1781/1787), ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''. Translated and edited by Paul Guyer and Allen W. Wood (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998), A58/B82.</ref> However, Kant denies that this correspondence definition of truth provides us with a test or criterion to establish which judgements are true. Kant states in his logic lectures:\n<blockquote>[...] Truth, it is said, consists in the agreement of cognition with its object. In consequence of this mere nominal definition, my cognition, to count as true, is supposed to agree with its object. Now I can compare the object with my cognition, however, only ''by cognizing it''.<!-- I wonder if the original had this cursive... --> Hence my cognition is supposed to confirm itself, which is far short of being sufficient for truth. For since the object is outside me, the cognition in me, all I can ever pass judgement on is whether my cognition of the object agrees with my cognition of the object.\n\nThe ancients called such a circle in explanation a ''diallelon''. And actually the logicians were always reproached with this mistake by the sceptics, who observed that with this definition of truth it is just as when someone makes a statement before a court and in doing so appeals to a witness with whom no one is acquainted, but who wants to establish his credibility by maintaining that the one who called him as witness is an honest man. The accusation was grounded, too. Only the solution of the indicated problem is impossible without qualification and for every man.

Michael Young (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992), pp. 557\u201358.</ref></blockquote>\nThis passage makes use of his distinction between nominal and real definitions. A nominal definition explains the meaning of a linguistic expression. A real definition describes the essence of certain [[Object (philosophy)|objects]] and enables us to determine whether any given item falls within the definition.<ref name = \"Vanzo-Kant\">Alberto Vanzo, \"Kant on the Nominal Definition of Truth\", ''Kant-Studien'', 101 (2010), pp. 147\u201366.</ref> Kant holds that the definition of truth is merely nominal and, therefore, we cannot employ it to establish which judgements are true. According to Kant, the ancient skeptics were critical of the logicians for holding that, by means of a merely nominal definition of truth, they can establish which judgements are true. They were trying to do something that is \"impossible without qualification and for every man\".<ref name = \"Kant-1801\" />\n\n====Hegel (1770\u20131831)====\n[[Georg Hegel]] distanced his philosophy from psychology by presenting truth as being an external self-moving object instead of being related to inner, subjective thoughts. Hegel's truth is analogous to the [[mechanics]] of a material body in motion under the influence of its own inner force. \"Truth is its own self-movement within itself.\"<ref>\"Die Wahrheit ist die Bewegung ihrer an ihr selbst.\" ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', Preface, \u00b6 48</ref> Teleological truth moves itself in the three-step form of [[Dialectic|dialectical triplicity]] toward the final goal of perfect, final, absolute truth. According to Hegel, the progression of philosophical truth is a resolution of past oppositions into increasingly more accurate approximations of absolute truth. [[Heinrich Moritz Chalyb\u00e4us|Chalyb\u00e4us]] used the terms \"[[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|thesis]]\", \"[[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|antithesis]]\", and \"[[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|synthesis]]\" to describe Hegel's dialectical triplicity.  The \"thesis\" consists of an incomplete historical movement. To resolve the incompletion, an \"antithesis\" occurs which opposes the \"thesis.\" In turn, the \"synthesis\" appears when the \"thesis\" and \"antithesis\" become [[Aufheben|reconciled]] and a higher level of truth is obtained. This \"synthesis\" thereby becomes a \"thesis,\" which will again necessitate an \"antithesis,\" requiring a new \"synthesis\" until a final state is reached as the result of reason's historical movement. History is the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute Spirit]] moving toward a goal. This historical progression will finally conclude itself when the Absolute Spirit understands its own infinite self at the very end of history. Absolute Spirit will then be the complete expression of an infinite [[God]].\n\n====Schopenhauer (1788\u20131860)====\nFor [[Arthur Schopenhauer]],<ref>''On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason'', \u00a7\u00a7 29\u201333</ref> a [[judgment]] is a combination or separation of two or more [[concept]]s. If a judgment is to be an expression of [[knowledge]], it must have a [[Principle of sufficient reason|sufficient reason]] or ground by which the judgment could be called true. ''Truth is the reference of a judgment to something different from itself which is its sufficient reason (ground)''. Judgments can have material, formal, transcendental, or metalogical truth. A judgment has ''material'' truth if its concepts are based on intuitive perceptions that are generated from sensations. If a judgment has its reason (ground) in another judgment, its truth is called logical or ''formal''. If a judgment, of, for example, pure mathematics or pure science, is based on the forms (space, time, causality) of intuitive, empirical knowledge, then the judgment has ''transcendental'' truth.\n\n====Kierkegaard (1813\u20131855)====\nWhen [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]], as his character ''Johannes Climacus'', ends his writings: ''My thesis was, subjectivity, heartfelt is the truth'', he does not advocate for [[subjectivism]] in its extreme form (the theory that something is true simply because one believes it to be so), but rather that the objective approach to matters of personal truth cannot shed any light upon that which is most essential to a person's life. Objective truths are concerned with the facts of a person's being, while subjective truths are concerned with a person's way of being. Kierkegaard agrees that objective truths for the study of subjects like mathematics, science, and history are relevant and necessary, but argues that objective truths do not shed any light on a person's inner relationship to existence. At best, these truths can only provide a severely narrowed perspective that has little to do with one's actual experience of life.<ref>Kierkegaard, S\u00f8ren. ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript''. Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1992</ref>\n\nWhile objective truths are final and static, subjective truths are continuing and dynamic. The truth of one's existence is a living, inward, and subjective experience that is always in the process of becoming. The values, morals, and spiritual approaches a person adopts, while not denying the existence of objective truths of those beliefs, can only become truly known when they have been inwardly appropriated through subjective experience. Thus, Kierkegaard criticizes all systematic philosophies which attempt to know life or the truth of existence via theories and objective knowledge about reality. As Kierkegaard claims, human truth is something that is continually occurring, and a human being cannot find truth separate from the subjective experience of one's own existing, defined by the values and fundamental essence that consist of one's way of life.<ref>Watts, Michael. ''Kierkegaard'', Oxford: Oneworld Publications, 2003</ref>\n\n====Nietzsche (1844\u20131900)====\n[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] believed the search for truth, or 'the will to truth', was a consequence of the ''[[will to power]]'' of philosophers. He thought that truth should be used as long as it promoted life and the ''will to power'', and he thought untruth was better than truth if it had this life enhancement as a consequence. As he wrote in ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'', \"The falseness of a judgment is to us not necessarily an objection to a judgment... The question is to what extent it is life-advancing, life-preserving, species-preserving, perhaps even species-breeding...\" (aphorism 4). He proposed the ''will to power'' as a truth only because, according to him, it was the most life-affirming and sincere perspective one could have.\n\nRobert Wicks discusses Nietzsche's basic view of truth as follows:\n<blockquote>[...] Some scholars regard Nietzsche's 1873 unpublished essay, \"On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense\" (\"\u00dcber Wahrheit und L\u00fcge im au\u00dfermoralischen Sinn\") as a keystone in his thought. In this essay, Nietzsche rejects the idea of universal constants, and claims that what we call \"truth\" is only \"a mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms.\" His view at this time is that arbitrariness completely prevails within human experience: concepts originate via the very artistic transference of nerve stimuli into images; \"truth\" is nothing more than the invention of fixed conventions for merely practical purposes, especially those of repose, security and consistence.

According to [[Martin Heidegger]], the original meaning and [[essence]] of truth in [[Ancient Greece]] was unconcealment, or the revealing or bringing of what was previously hidden into the open, as indicated by the original Greek term for truth, ''[[aletheia]]''.<ref>http://aphelis.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Martin-Heidegger-On-the-Essence-of-Truth.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ontology.co/heidegger-aletheia.htm|title=Martin Heidegger on Aletheia (Truth) as Unconcealment|publisher=|access-date=2010-08-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626101634/http://www.ontology.co/heidegger-aletheia.htm|archive-date=2015-06-26|url-status=dead}}</ref> On this view, the conception of truth as correctness is a later derivation from the concept's original essence, a development Heidegger traces to the [[Latin]] term ''[[veritas]]''.\n\n====Whitehead (1861\u20131947)====\n[[Alfred North Whitehead]], a British mathematician who became an American philosopher, said: \"There are no whole truths; all truths are half-truths. It is trying to treat them as whole truths that plays the devil\".<ref>Alfred North Whitehead, ''Dialogues'', 1954: Prologue.</ref>\n\nThe logical progression or connection of this line of thought is to conclude that truth can lie, since [[half-truth]]s are deceptive and may lead to a false conclusion.\n\n====Peirce (1839\u20131914)====\n[[Pragmatists]] like [[C. S. Peirce]] take truth to have some manner of essential relation to human practices for inquiring into and [[discovering]] truth, with Peirce himself holding that truth is what human [[inquiry]] would find out on a matter, if our practice of inquiry were taken as far as it could profitably go: \"The opinion which is fated to be ultimately agreed to by all who investigate, is what we mean by the truth...\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peirce.org/writings/p119.html|title=How to Make Our Ideas Clear|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Nishida (1870\u20131945)====\nAccording to [[Kitaro Nishida]], \"knowledge of things in the world begins with the differentiation of unitary consciousness into knower and known and ends with self and things becoming one again. Such unification takes form not only in knowing but in the valuing (of truth) that directs knowing, the willing that directs action, and the feeling or emotive reach that directs sensing.\"<ref>John Maraldo, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nishida-kitaro/#2.2 Nishida Kitar\u00f4 \u2013 Self-Awareness], in: ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Spring 2005 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)</ref>\n\n====Fromm (1900\u20131980)====\n[[Erich Fromm]] finds that trying to discuss truth as \"absolute truth\" is sterile and that emphasis ought to be placed on \"optimal truth\". He considers truth as stemming from the survival imperative of grasping one's environment physically and intellectually, whereby young children instinctively seek truth so as to orient themselves in \"a strange and powerful world\". The accuracy of their perceived approximation of the truth will therefore have direct consequences on their ability to deal with their environment. Fromm can be understood to define truth as a functional approximation of reality. His vision of optimal truth is described partly in \"Man from Himself: An Inquiry into the Psychology of Ethics\" (1947), from which excerpts are included below.\n\n: the dichotomy between 'absolute = perfect' and 'relative = imperfect' has been superseded in all fields of scientific thought, where \"it is generally recognized that there is no absolute truth but nevertheless that there are objectively valid laws and principles\".\n\n: In that respect, \"a scientifically or rationally valid statement means that the power of reason is applied to all the available data of observation without any of them being suppressed or falsified for the sake of a desired result\". The history of science is \"a history of inadequate and incomplete statements, and every new insight makes possible the recognition of the inadequacies of previous propositions and offers a springboard for creating a more adequate formulation.\"\n\n: As a result \"the history of thought is the history of an ever-increasing approximation to the truth. Scientific knowledge is not absolute but optimal; it contains the optimum of truth attainable in a given historical period.\" Fromm furthermore notes that \"different cultures have emphasized various aspects of the truth\" and that increasing interaction between cultures allows for these aspects to reconcile and integrate, increasing further the approximation to the truth.\n\n====Foucault (1926\u20131984)====\n[[File:What-is-truth02.jpg|thumb|''[[John 18:38|Quid Est Veritas?]]'' [[Christ]] and [[Pilate]], by [[Nikolai Ge]].]]\n\nTruth, says [[Michel Foucault]], is problematic when any attempt is made to see truth as an \"objective\" quality.  He prefers not to use the term truth itself but \"Regimes of Truth\".  In his historical investigations he found truth to be something that was itself a part of, or embedded within, a given power structure.  Thus Foucault's view shares much in common with the concepts of [[Truth#Nietzsche|Nietzsche]].  Truth for Foucault is also something that shifts through various [[episteme]] throughout history.<ref>Foucault, M. \"The Order of Things\", London: Vintage Books, 1970 (1966)</ref>\n\n====Baudrillard (1929\u20132007)====\n[[Jean Baudrillard]] considered truth to be largely simulated, that is pretending to have something, as opposed to dissimulation, pretending to not have something.

One must remember that though such examples seem extreme, such extremity is an important part of Baudrillard's theory. For a less extreme example, consider how movies usually end with the bad being punished, humiliated, or otherwise failing, thus affirming for viewers the concept that the good end happily and the bad unhappily, a narrative which implies that the status quo and established power structures are largely legitimate.<ref name = \"Baudrillard\"/>\n\n==In medicine and psychiatry==\nThere is controversy as to the truth value of a proposition made in [[bad faith]] self-deception, such as when a [[hypochondriac]] has a complaint with no physical symptom.<ref name=PMREN>\"Absent a lesion or a physiological disturbance to account readily for the complaint, the complaint was likely to be regarded as male fide\", \"Post-Modern Reflections on the Ethics of Naming\", ''The Ethics of Diagnosis Philosophy and Medicine'', 1992, Volume 40, Section V, 275\u2013300, George Khushf, [https://doi.org/10.1007%2F978-0-585-28333-3_21 springerlink.com]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia books|Epistemology}}\n{{Portal|Philosophy|Psychology}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Asha]]\n* [[Belief]]\n* [[Confirmation holism]]\n* [[Contextualism]]\n* [[Contradiction]]\n* [[Degree of truth]]\n* [[Disposition]]\n* [[Eclecticism]]\n* [[Epistemic theories of truth]]\n* [[Honesty]]\n* [[Independence (probability theory)]]\n* [[Imagination]]\n* [[Invariant (mathematics)]]\n* [[Lie]]\n* [[McNamara fallacy]]\n* [[Normative science]]\n* ''[[On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense]]''\n* [[Perjury]]\n* [[Perspectivism]]\n* [[Physical symbol system]]\n* [[Post-truth politics]]\n* [[Proof (truth)|Proof]]\n* [[Public opinion]]\n* [[Revision theory]]\n* [[Relativism]]\n* [[Religious views on truth]]\n* [[Satya]]\n* [[Slingshot argument]]\n* [[Tautology (logic)]]\n* [[Tautology (rhetoric)]]\n* [[Theory of justification]]\n* [[Truth prevails]]\n* [[Truthiness]]\n* [[Two truths doctrine]]\n* [[Unity of the proposition]]\n* [[Verisimilitude]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Other theorists===\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Augustine of Hippo]]\n* [[Brand Blanshard]]\n* [[Hartry Field]]\n* [[Gottlob Frege]]\n* [[Paul Horwich]]\n* [[Harold Joachim]]\n* [[Karl Popper]]\n* [[P.

Oliphant hailed. A retired English headmistress, Oliphant started [[Welham Boys' School]] in 1937. She was struck by [[The Lawrence School, Sanawar]] and lack of schools of similar quality for the girls around Dehradun.\n\nShe acquired a palatial estate called Nasreen adjacent to [[Welham Boys' School]] to start a small boarding school for girls. There were no funds, staff, or school buildings. Oliphant recruited another retired English woman, [[Grace Mary Linnel]], to run the boarding school for girls. Linnel became the founder principal of Welham Girls School, which started in 1957.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.welhamgirls.com/welham-girls-history.html|title=History|publisher=}}</ref> Welham Girls\u2019 High School, as it was known then, established itself as a full-fledged boarding school. From its initial crop of 10 students, it has grown to over 550 students.\n\n== Houses ==\n\nLike British boarding schools, Welham follows the house system. The school has 5 houses named after the popular birds found in the Doon Valley: Bulbuls, Flycatchers, Hoopoes, Orioles and Woodpeckers. There are regular competitions between the houses in disciplines such as sports, dance, music, debating, quizzing, dramatics. Each house is looked after by a house mistress and a matron and headed by a two student officials \u2014 a house captain and a vice captain. Junior and senior girls have separate hostels.Bulbuls being the best house.\n\n== Extracurricular activities ==\n\nStudents volunteer at local charities, such as Cheshire Home for the Handicapped and Raphael, a school for the blind and other charitable organizations. There is also an organized social service program on campus run by campus officials.\n\nThe school hosts competitive events amongst the five houses throughout the year in the sphere of sports and arts. Career counseling and life-skills programmes are offered.\n\nEach student is expected to take up two activities each term. These include musical and creative activities such as craft, dramatics, sitar, tabla, vocal music, western music, bharatnatyam, kathak, folk dance and photography.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2011/20110518/dplus.htm |title=The Tribune, Chandigarh, India - Dehradun Plus |publisher=Tribuneindia.com |date= |accessdate=28 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nThese include basketball, hockey, swimming, badminton, lawn tennis, athletics, table tennis, karate, shooting and aerobics. The basketball team has won numerous tournaments over the years and represented Uttrakhand at the national level. Several students have been chosen for the India camp as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-05-06/others/29515926_1_mohali-boys-cagers |title=YPS, Mohali cagers shine - Times Of India |publisher=Articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=6 May 2011 |accessdate=28 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[The Duke of Edinburgh's Award]] scheme  is a programme that the school offers to its students.\n\n=== Clubs and societies ===\n\nThere are multiple opportunities for girls to explore. Being involved in activities is an essential aspect of being a Welhamite. Students get involved in these activities from their first day in school. The activities on campus are:\n* Nature Club\n* Quiz Club\n* English Debating\n* Hindi Debating\n* Music: Indian Classical (vocal), Sitar, Western Vocals, Western Instrumental\n* Dance: Kathak, Bharatnatyam, Folkdance, Contemporary\n* Craft\n* Photography\n* Computers\n* French\n* Dramatics\n\n=== Publications ===\n\nThe school newspapers, ''News and Views'' in English and ''Kshitij'' in Hindi, are published every month, as well as a science magazine, ''Delphic''. A technology-based publication, 'The Tech-Key' is also published 4 times a year. It is the newest addition in school, having started in April 2019. Two issues of the magazine ''The Wall'' are published each year. Additionally, the school publishes an English literary and art publication, ''Chrysalis'', twice a term.

Oliphant hailed. A retired English headmistress, Oliphant started [[Welham Boys' School]] in 1937. She was struck by [[The Lawrence School, Sanawar]] and lack of schools of similar quality for the girls around Dehradun.\n\nShe acquired a palatial estate called Nasreen adjacent to [[Welham Boys' School]] to start a small boarding school for girls. There were no funds, staff, or school buildings. Oliphant recruited another retired English woman, [[Grace Mary Linnel]], to run the boarding school for girls. Linnel became the founder principal of Welham Girls School, which started in 1957.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.welhamgirls.com/welham-girls-history.html|title=History|publisher=}}</ref> Welham Girls\u2019 High School, as it was known then, established itself as a full-fledged boarding school. From its initial crop of 10 students, it has grown to over 550 students.\n\n== Houses ==\n\nLike British boarding schools, Welham follows the house system. The school has 5 houses named after the popular birds found in the Doon Valley: Bulbuls, Flycatchers, Hoopoes, Orioles and Woodpeckers. There are regular competitions between the houses in disciplines such as sports, dance, music, debating, quizzing, dramatics. Each house is looked after by a house mistress and a matron and headed by a two student officials \u2014 a house captain and a vice captain. Junior and senior girls have separate hostels.Bulbuls being the best house.\n\n== Extracurricular activities ==\n\nStudents volunteer at local charities, such as Cheshire Home for the Handicapped and Raphael, a school for the blind and other charitable organizations. There is also an organized social service program on campus run by campus officials.\n\nThe school hosts competitive events amongst the five houses throughout the year in the sphere of sports and arts. Career counseling and life-skills programmes are offered.\n\nEach student is expected to take up two activities each term. These include musical and creative activities such as craft, dramatics, sitar, tabla, vocal music, western music, bharatnatyam, kathak, folk dance and photography.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2011/20110518/dplus.htm |title=The Tribune, Chandigarh, India - Dehradun Plus |publisher=Tribuneindia.com |date= |accessdate=28 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nThese include basketball, hockey, swimming, badminton, lawn tennis, athletics, table tennis, karate, shooting and aerobics. The basketball team has won numerous tournaments over the years and represented Uttrakhand at the national level.

The activities on campus are:\n* Nature Club\n* Quiz Club\n* English Debating\n* Hindi Debating\n* Music: Indian Classical (vocal), Sitar, Western Vocals, Western Instrumental\n* Dance: Kathak, Bharatnatyam, Folkdance, Contemporary\n* Craft\n* Photography\n* Computers\n* French\n* Dramatics\n\n=== Publications ===\n\nThe school newspapers, ''News and Views'' in English and ''Kshitij'' in Hindi, are published every month, as well as a science magazine, ''Delphic''. A technology-based publication, 'The Tech-Key' is also published 4 times a year. It is the newest addition in school, having started in April 2019.

He was born and raised at [[Middleton Hall, Warwickshire]], the only son of an affluent country family. He was a student at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he was tutored by the mathematician and naturalist [[John Ray]], who became a lifetime friend and colleague, and lived with Willughby after 1662 when he lost his livelihood through his refusal to sign the [[Act of Uniformity 1662|Act of Uniformity]]. Willughby was elected as a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1661, then aged 27.\n\nWillughby, Ray, and others such as [[John Wilkins]] were advocates of a new way of studying science, relying on observation and classification, rather than the received authority of [[Aristotle]] and the Bible. To this end, Willughby, Ray and their friends undertook a number of journeys to gather information and specimens, initially in England and Wales, but culminating in an extensive tour of continental Europe, visiting museums, libraries and private collections as well as studying local animals and plants. After their continental tour, he and Ray lived and worked mainly at Middleton Hall. Willughby married Emma Barnard in 1668 and the couple had three children.\n\nWillughby had suffered bouts of illness over the years, and eventually died of [[pleurisy]] in July 1672, aged 36. His premature death meant that it fell to Ray to complete the works on animals they had jointly planned. In due course, Ray published books on birds, fish and [[invertebrate]]s, the ''Ornithologiae Libri Tres'', ''Historia Piscium'' and ''Historia Insectorum''. The ''Ornithology'' was also published in an expanded form in English. The books included innovative and effective ways of classifying animals, and all three were influential in the history of [[List of life sciences|life science]], including their effect on subsequent [[natural history]] writers and their importance in the development of [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus's]] [[binomial nomenclature]].\n\n==Early life==\n\n[[File:Middleton Hall 04.jpg|thumb|The Willughby family home at [[Middleton Hall, Warwickshire|Middleton Hall]]{{efn| Middleton Hall is a grade II* [[Listed building#Categories of listed buildings|listed building]].

(2003), p. 1.</ref> }} [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (22 November 1635 \u2013 3 July 1672) was an English [[ornithology|ornithologist]] and [[ichthyology|ichthyologist]], and an early student of [[linguistics]] and [[game studies|games]]. He was born and raised at [[Middleton Hall, Warwickshire]], the only son of an affluent country family. He was a student at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he was tutored by the mathematician and naturalist [[John Ray]], who became a lifetime friend and colleague, and lived with Willughby after 1662 when he lost his livelihood through his refusal to sign the [[Act of Uniformity 1662|Act of Uniformity]]. Willughby was elected as a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1661, then aged 27.\n\nWillughby, Ray, and others such as [[John Wilkins]] were advocates of a new way of studying science, relying on observation and classification, rather than the received authority of [[Aristotle]] and the Bible. To this end, Willughby, Ray and their friends undertook a number of journeys to gather information and specimens, initially in England and Wales, but culminating in an extensive tour of continental Europe, visiting museums, libraries and private collections as well as studying local animals and plants. After their continental tour, he and Ray lived and worked mainly at Middleton Hall. Willughby married Emma Barnard in 1668 and the couple had three children.\n\nWillughby had suffered bouts of illness over the years, and eventually died of [[pleurisy]] in July 1672, aged 36. His premature death meant that it fell to Ray to complete the works on animals they had jointly planned. In due course, Ray published books on birds, fish and [[invertebrate]]s, the ''Ornithologiae Libri Tres'', ''Historia Piscium'' and ''Historia Insectorum''. The ''Ornithology'' was also published in an expanded form in English.

Furthermore, there were far more known species of fish than there were birds to describe, and Ray was working on his own ''History of Plants''.<ref name= birkhead241/><ref name=jardine303>Jardine (1999) pp. 303\u2013306.</ref> The ''Historia Piscium'' was finally published in Latin in 1686 with a dedication to [[Samuel Pepys]], President of the Royal Society, who had made a generous financial contribution to the project. The book had four sections: an introduction to fish biology; [[cetacea]]ns; [[Chondrichthyes|cartilaginous fish]] (sharks and [[Batoidea|rays]]); and [[Osteichthyes|bony fish]], the last group being further classified by the number and nature of their fins. 187 plates completed the work, their cost making the book a financial disaster for the Royal Society, which had largely funded its publication.<ref name= birkhead241>Birkhead (2018) pp. 241\u2013245.</ref><ref name=jardine307>Jardine (1999) pp. 307\u2013310.</ref><ref name=Kusukawa309>Kusukawa (2016) p. 309.</ref>\n\n===\"Insects\"===\n[[File:Megachile willughbiella male (21626826474).jpg|thumb|upright=0.60|Willughby studied this [[Megachile|leaf-cutter bee]], named by [[William Kirby (entomologist)|Kirby]] in 1802 as ''[[Megachile willughbiella]]''.|alt=a bee on a flower]]\nIn the seventeenth century, the term \"insect\" had a much wider meaning than it does today, so the third major book, ''Historia Insectorum'', included many other [[invertebrate]]s, such as worms, spiders and [[millipede]]s. It excluded [[Mollusca|molluscs]], perhaps because [[Martin Lister]], another Fellow of the Royal Society, was writing his own ''Historia Animalium'' that covered that group. Ray's problems with completing this publication were much the same as with the fish book, although in 1704 he was able to see manuscripts prepared independently by Sir Thomas Willoughby and the scholar Thomas Man, Sir Thomas having moved into Wollaton Hall in 1687 and regained access to Middleton and his father's papers and possessions.<ref name= birkhead246>Birkhead (2018) pp. 246\u2013251.</ref>\n\nRay died in January 1705, and little happened with the ''Historia Insectorum'' until [[William Derham]] and the Royal Society finally published it in 1710 in Latin, incomplete, unillustrated and under Ray's name only.<ref name= birkhead246/> Ray, however, makes it clear that Willughby did the bulk of the insect research,<ref name=kusukawa336>Kusukawa (2016) pp. 336\u2013337.</ref> including, for example, 20 pages of beetle descriptions.<ref name=ogilvie352>Ogilvie (2016) p. 352.</ref> The book had four sections, starting with an innovative [[Taxonomy (biology)|classification system]] based on  [[metamorphosis]].<ref name= birkhead246/> The second section contained the main species descriptions, followed by Ray's observations of [[lepidoptera|butterflies and moths]] and their caterpillars, and an appendix by Martin Lister on British beetles.<ref name=ogilvie340>Ogilvie (2016) p. 340.</ref> Plates prepared by Sir Thomas Willoughby were not used, and they have now been lost, as have the manuscripts Sir Thomas showed to Ray.<ref name= birkhead246/>\n\n===Games and probability===\n[[File:Playingcardsvanda.jpg|thumb|upright=0.60|Willughby is believed to have studied [[probability]] with respect to card games.

Willughby's own extensive collection included paintings he had bought on his European travels, and he also borrowed pictures owned by friends like Skippon and Sir [[Thomas Browne]]. Many illustrations were taken from previous publications by other writers,<ref name= birkhead216>Birkhead (2018) pp. 216\u2013217.</ref> and some were based on [[Francis Barlow (artist)|Francis Barlow's]] oil-paintings of birds in [[Charles II of England|Charles II's]] [[aviary]] in [[St James's Park]].<ref name= birkhead227>Birkhead (2018) pp. 227\u2013228.</ref><ref name= jackson>Jackson (2006) pp. 114\u2013115.</ref>\n\nThe illustrations taken from earlier books were from many sources, particularly the earlier natural histories or ornithologies by [[Ulisse Aldrovandi]], [[Giovanni Pietro Olina|Pietro Olina]], [[Georg Marcgrave]] and [[Willem Piso]].<ref name= birkhead2016292>Birkhead ''et al'' (2016) pp. 292\u2013295.</ref> Where feasible, Willughby and Ray compared the available illustrations with life or specimens, or, if that were not possible, against each other, to select the most accurate version for publication.<ref name=flis/> In addition to these authors, sources used for the text included works by [[Carolus Clusius]], [[Adriaen Collaert]], [[Gervase Markham]], [[Juan Eusebio Nieremberg]] and [[Ole Worm]].<ref name= birkhead2016292/><ref name=Gurney>Gurney (1921) pp. [https://archive.org/details/cu31924005489558/page/n220 210\u2013211]</ref> Olina's ''Ucelliera'', at least, seems to have been revisited between the Latin and English editions of the ''Ornithology'', since the later version contains a description of [[territory (animal)|territorial]] behaviour by the [[common nightingale|nightingale]] absent from the earlier work.<ref name= birkhead2011223>Birkhead (2011) p. 223.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:FMIB 46268 Willoughby's Char.jpeg|thumb| Windermere or Willughby's charr, ''[[Salvelinus willughbii]]''|alt=Drawing of a trout-like fish]]\n\nMuch of Willughby's written work has been lost, along with his scientific equipment and most of his collections of items of natural history interest;<ref name =birkhead89>Birkhead (2018) pp. 89\u201393.</ref><ref name=charm>Charmantier ''et al'' (2016) pp. 360\u2013361.</ref> what remains is largely owned by the family and housed in the University of Nottingham Middleton archive.<ref name=charm373>Charmantier ''et al'' (2016) p. 373.</ref> The ''Ornithology'' influenced [[Ren\u00e9 Antoine Ferchault de R\u00e9aumur|R\u00e9amur]] in organising his great bird collection, and [[Mathurin Jacques Brisson|Brisson]] in the compilation of his own work on the topic.

Some of its ruins survive, some four miles north-east of [[Maidstone]].\n\n== Notable events ==\n\nIn 1171, the then abbot was one of those responsible for the burial of the murdered archbishop of Canterbury, [[Thomas Becket]]. In 1193 the abbots of Boxley and [[Robertsbridge Abbey|Robertsbridge]] journeyed to the continent to search for [[King Richard I]], finally locating him in [[Bavaria]].

In 1538 during the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] one Geoffrey Chamber,  a \"commissioner\" employed by [[Thomas Cromwell]] to oversee the closure of the institution, examined the famed relic and discovered it to be a fake, observing the levers and wires that enacted the so-called miracles.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gairdner|first1=James|authorlink=James Gairdner|title=Lollardy and the Reformation in England: An Historical Survey|date=1911|publisher=Macmillan|location=London|page=122|volume=3}}</ref> The rood was taken down and displayed in [[Maidstone]] market so as to demonstrate the fraud. Finally, it was sent to [[London]] and with the accompaniment of a sermon from the [[Bishop of Rochester]] it was hacked to pieces and burnt.

Between 5% and 12% of the population worldwide suffer from specific phobias.<ref name=\"Barker2003\"/> Sufferers typically anticipate terrifying consequences from encountering the object of their fear, which can be anything from an animal to a location to a bodily fluid to a particular situation. Common phobias are flying, blood, water, highway driving, and tunnels. When people are exposed to their phobia, they may experience trembling, shortness of breath, or rapid heartbeat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mentalhealth.gov/what-to-look-for/anxiety-disorders/phobias/index.html|title=Phobias|last=U.S. Department of Health & Human Services|date=2017|website=www.mentalhealth.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-12-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170513022004/https://www.mentalhealth.gov/what-to-look-for/anxiety-disorders/phobias/index.html|archive-date=13 May 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> People understand that their fear is not proportional to the actual potential danger but still are overwhelmed by it.<ref>''Psychology''.

These [[panic attacks]], defined by the [[American Psychiatric Association|APA]] as fear or discomfort that abruptly arises and peaks in less than ten minutes, can last for several hours.<ref>{{cite web|title=Panic Disorder|url=https://www.med.upenn.edu/ctsa/panic_symptoms.html|website=Center for the Treatment and Study of Anxiety, University of Pennsylvania|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527074826/http://www.med.upenn.edu/ctsa/panic_symptoms.html|archivedate=27 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Attacks can be triggered by stress, irrational thoughts, general fear or fear of the unknown, or even exercise. However, sometimes the trigger is unclear and the attacks can arise without warning. To help prevent an attack one can avoid the trigger. This being said not all attacks can be prevented.\n\nIn addition to recurrent unexpected panic attacks, a diagnosis of panic disorder requires that said attacks have chronic consequences: either worry over the attacks' potential implications, persistent fear of future attacks, or significant changes in behavior related to the attacks. As such, those suffering from panic disorder experience symptoms even outside specific panic episodes. Often, normal changes in heartbeat are noticed by a panic sufferer, leading them to think something is wrong with their heart or they are about to have another panic attack. In some cases, a heightened awareness ([[hypervigilance]]) of body functioning occurs during panic attacks, wherein any perceived physiological change is interpreted as a possible life-threatening illness (i.e., extreme [[hypochondriasis]]).\n\n===Agoraphobia===\n{{Main|Agoraphobia}}\nAgoraphobia is the specific anxiety about being in a place or situation where escape is difficult or embarrassing or where help may be unavailable.<ref>{{harvnb|Craske|2003}} Gorman, 2000</ref> Agoraphobia is strongly linked with [[panic disorder]] and is often precipitated by the fear of having a panic attack. A common manifestation involves needing to be in constant view of a door or other escape route. In addition to the fears themselves, the term [[agoraphobia]] is often used to refer to avoidance behaviors that sufferers often develop.<ref>{{cite book |author1= Jane E. Fisher |author2= William T.

These avoidance behaviors can often have serious consequences and often reinforce the fear they are caused by.\n\n===Social anxiety disorder===\n{{Main|Social anxiety disorder}}\n[[Social anxiety disorder]] (SAD; also known as social phobia) describes an intense fear and avoidance of negative public scrutiny, public embarrassment, humiliation, or social interaction. This [[fear]] can be specific to particular social situations (such as public speaking) or, more typically, is experienced in most (or all) social interactions. [[Social anxiety]] often manifests specific physical symptoms, including blushing, sweating, and difficulty speaking. As with all phobic disorders, those suffering from social anxiety often will attempt to avoid the source of their anxiety; in the case of social anxiety this is particularly problematic, and in severe cases can lead to complete social isolation.\n\nSocial physique anxiety (SPA) is a subtype of social anxiety. It is concern over the evaluation of one's body by others.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of Exercise Psychology|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199930746|page=56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VR1pAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA56}}</ref> SPA is common among adolescents, especially females.\n\n===Post-traumatic stress disorder===\n{{Main|Post-traumatic stress disorder}}\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was once an anxiety disorder (now moved to ''trauma- and stressor-related disorders'' in DSM-V) that results from a traumatic experience.

It can also be caused by various events that make that particular individual uncomfortable. Its occurrence is very common. Often, an individual will experience panic attacks or extreme anxiety in specific situations. A situation that causes one individual to experience anxiety may not affect another individual at all. For example, some people become uneasy in crowds or tight spaces, so standing in a tightly packed line, say at the bank or a store register, may cause them to experience extreme anxiety, possibly a panic attack.<ref>Situational Panic Attacks.

In fact, the hormonal response to anxiety has evolved as a benefit, as it helps humans react to dangers. Researchers in [[evolutionary medicine]] believe this adaptation allows humans to realize there is a potential threat and to act accordingly in order to ensure greatest possibility of protection. It has actually been shown that those with low levels of anxiety have a greater risk of death than those with average levels. This is because the absence of fear can lead to injury or death.<ref name=\"Grinde 2005 904\u2013909\"/> Additionally, patients with both anxiety and depression were found to have lower morbidity than those with depression alone.<ref name=\"Bateson 2011 707\u2013715\">{{cite journal|last=Bateson|first=M|author2=B.

For example, in the Stone Age there was greater skin-to-skin contact and more handling of babies by their mothers, both of which are strategies that reduce anxiety.<ref name=\"Grinde 2005 904\u2013909\"/> Additionally, there is greater interaction with strangers in present times as opposed to interactions solely between close-knit tribes. Researchers posit that the lack of constant social interaction, especially in the formative years, is a driving cause of high rates of anxiety.\n\nMany current cases are likely to have resulted from an [[Mismatch theory|evolutionary mismatch]], which has been specifically termed a \"psychopathogical mismatch\". In evolutionary terms, a mismatch occurs when an individual possesses traits that were adapted for an environment that differs from the individual's current environment. For example, even though an anxiety reaction may have been evolved to help with life-threatening situations, for highly sensitized individuals in Westernized cultures simply hearing bad news can elicit a strong reaction.<ref name=\"Price 2003 223\u2013236\">{{cite journal|last=Price|first=John S.|title=Evolutionary aspects of anxiety disorders|journal=Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience|date=September 2003|volume=5|issue=3|pages=223\u2013236|pmc=3181631|pmid=22033473|doi=10.1016/B978-0-323-03354-1.50022-5}}</ref>\n\nAn evolutionary perspective may provide insight into alternatives to current clinical treatment methods for anxiety disorders. Simply knowing some anxiety is beneficial may alleviate some of the panic associated with mild conditions. Some researchers believe that, in theory, anxiety can be mediated by reducing a patient's feeling of vulnerability and then changing their appraisal of the situation.<ref name=\"Price 2003 223\u2013236\"/>\n\n==Mechanisms==\n===Biological===\nLow levels of [[gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABA]], a [[neurotransmitter]] that reduces activity in the central nervous system, contribute to anxiety.

The basolateral complex processes sensory-related fear memories and communicates their threat importance to memory and [[sensory processing]] elsewhere in the brain, such as the [[medial prefrontal cortex]] and sensory cortices.\n\nAnother important area is the adjacent central nucleus of the amygdala, which controls species-specific fear responses, via connections to the [[brainstem]], [[hypothalamus]], and [[cerebellum]] areas. In those with general anxiety disorder, these connections functionally seem to be less distinct, with greater [[gray matter]] in the central nucleus. Another difference is that the amygdala areas have decreased connectivity with the [[insular cortex|insula]] and [[cingulate cortex|cingulate]] areas that control general stimulus salience, while having greater connectivity with the [[parietal cortex]] and [[prefrontal cortex]] circuits that underlie [[executive function]]s.<ref name=\"Etkin\"/>\n\nThe latter suggests a compensation strategy for dysfunctional amygdala processing of anxiety. Researchers have noted \"Amygdalofrontoparietal coupling in generalized anxiety disorder patients may&nbsp;... reflect the habitual engagement of a cognitive control system to regulate excessive anxiety.\"<ref name=\"Etkin\"/> This is consistent with cognitive theories that suggest the use in this disorder of attempts to reduce the involvement of emotions with compensatory cognitive strategies.\n\nClinical and animal studies suggest a correlation between anxiety disorders and difficulty in maintaining balance.<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Kalueff AV, Ishikawa K, Griffith AJ |title=Anxiety and otovestibular disorders: linking behavioral phenotypes in men and mice|journal=Behav.

Between 5% and 12% of the population worldwide suffer from specific phobias.<ref name=\"Barker2003\"/> Sufferers typically anticipate terrifying consequences from encountering the object of their fear, which can be anything from an animal to a location to a bodily fluid to a particular situation. Common phobias are flying, blood, water, highway driving, and tunnels. When people are exposed to their phobia, they may experience trembling, shortness of breath, or rapid heartbeat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mentalhealth.gov/what-to-look-for/anxiety-disorders/phobias/index.html|title=Phobias|last=U.S. Department of Health & Human Services|date=2017|website=www.mentalhealth.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-12-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170513022004/https://www.mentalhealth.gov/what-to-look-for/anxiety-disorders/phobias/index.html|archive-date=13 May 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> People understand that their fear is not proportional to the actual potential danger but still are overwhelmed by it.<ref>''Psychology''.

(2009) McGrath Hill Higher Education; UK: McGrath Hill companies Inc.</ref>\n\n===Panic disorder===\n{{Main|Panic disorder}}\nWith panic disorder, a person has brief attacks of intense terror and apprehension, often marked by trembling, shaking, confusion, dizziness, nausea, and/or difficulty breathing. These [[panic attacks]], defined by the [[American Psychiatric Association|APA]] as fear or discomfort that abruptly arises and peaks in less than ten minutes, can last for several hours.<ref>{{cite web|title=Panic Disorder|url=https://www.med.upenn.edu/ctsa/panic_symptoms.html|website=Center for the Treatment and Study of Anxiety, University of Pennsylvania|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527074826/http://www.med.upenn.edu/ctsa/panic_symptoms.html|archivedate=27 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Attacks can be triggered by stress, irrational thoughts, general fear or fear of the unknown, or even exercise. However, sometimes the trigger is unclear and the attacks can arise without warning. To help prevent an attack one can avoid the trigger. This being said not all attacks can be prevented.\n\nIn addition to recurrent unexpected panic attacks, a diagnosis of panic disorder requires that said attacks have chronic consequences: either worry over the attacks' potential implications, persistent fear of future attacks, or significant changes in behavior related to the attacks. As such, those suffering from panic disorder experience symptoms even outside specific panic episodes. Often, normal changes in heartbeat are noticed by a panic sufferer, leading them to think something is wrong with their heart or they are about to have another panic attack. In some cases, a heightened awareness ([[hypervigilance]]) of body functioning occurs during panic attacks, wherein any perceived physiological change is interpreted as a possible life-threatening illness (i.e., extreme [[hypochondriasis]]).\n\n===Agoraphobia===\n{{Main|Agoraphobia}}\nAgoraphobia is the specific anxiety about being in a place or situation where escape is difficult or embarrassing or where help may be unavailable.<ref>{{harvnb|Craske|2003}} Gorman, 2000</ref> Agoraphobia is strongly linked with [[panic disorder]] and is often precipitated by the fear of having a panic attack. A common manifestation involves needing to be in constant view of a door or other escape route. In addition to the fears themselves, the term [[agoraphobia]] is often used to refer to avoidance behaviors that sufferers often develop.<ref>{{cite book |author1= Jane E. Fisher |author2= William T. O'Donohue |title= Practitioner's Guide to Evidence-Based Psychotherapy |date= 27 July 2006 |publisher= Springer |isbn= 978-0387283692 |pages= 754 |df= dmy-all }}</ref> For example, following a panic attack while driving, someone suffering from agoraphobia may develop anxiety over driving and will therefore avoid driving. These avoidance behaviors can often have serious consequences and often reinforce the fear they are caused by.\n\n===Social anxiety disorder===\n{{Main|Social anxiety disorder}}\n[[Social anxiety disorder]] (SAD; also known as social phobia) describes an intense fear and avoidance of negative public scrutiny, public embarrassment, humiliation, or social interaction. This [[fear]] can be specific to particular social situations (such as public speaking) or, more typically, is experienced in most (or all) social interactions. [[Social anxiety]] often manifests specific physical symptoms, including blushing, sweating, and difficulty speaking. As with all phobic disorders, those suffering from social anxiety often will attempt to avoid the source of their anxiety; in the case of social anxiety this is particularly problematic, and in severe cases can lead to complete social isolation.\n\nSocial physique anxiety (SPA) is a subtype of social anxiety. It is concern over the evaluation of one's body by others.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of Exercise Psychology|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199930746|page=56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VR1pAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA56}}</ref> SPA is common among adolescents, especially females.\n\n===Post-traumatic stress disorder===\n{{Main|Post-traumatic stress disorder}}\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was once an anxiety disorder (now moved to ''trauma- and stressor-related disorders'' in DSM-V) that results from a traumatic experience. Post-traumatic stress can result from an extreme situation, such as combat, natural disaster, rape, hostage situations, child abuse, bullying, or even a serious accident. It can also result from long-term (chronic) exposure to a severe stressor--<ref>{{Cite book | title=Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and the Family | publisher=Veterans Affairs Canada | url=http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/clients/sub.cfm?source=mhealth/ptsd_families# | isbn=978-0-662-42627-1 | year=2006 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214122623/http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/clients/sub.cfm?source=mhealth%2Fptsd_families | archivedate=14 February 2009 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> for example, soldiers who endure individual battles but cannot [[coping (psychology)|cope]] with continuous combat.

It can also be caused by various events that make that particular individual uncomfortable. Its occurrence is very common. Often, an individual will experience panic attacks or extreme anxiety in specific situations. A situation that causes one individual to experience anxiety may not affect another individual at all. For example, some people become uneasy in crowds or tight spaces, so standing in a tightly packed line, say at the bank or a store register, may cause them to experience extreme anxiety, possibly a panic attack.<ref>Situational Panic Attacks.

In fact, the hormonal response to anxiety has evolved as a benefit, as it helps humans react to dangers. Researchers in [[evolutionary medicine]] believe this adaptation allows humans to realize there is a potential threat and to act accordingly in order to ensure greatest possibility of protection. It has actually been shown that those with low levels of anxiety have a greater risk of death than those with average levels. This is because the absence of fear can lead to injury or death.<ref name=\"Grinde 2005 904\u2013909\"/> Additionally, patients with both anxiety and depression were found to have lower morbidity than those with depression alone.<ref name=\"Bateson 2011 707\u2013715\">{{cite journal|last=Bateson|first=M|author2=B.

For example, in the Stone Age there was greater skin-to-skin contact and more handling of babies by their mothers, both of which are strategies that reduce anxiety.<ref name=\"Grinde 2005 904\u2013909\"/> Additionally, there is greater interaction with strangers in present times as opposed to interactions solely between close-knit tribes. Researchers posit that the lack of constant social interaction, especially in the formative years, is a driving cause of high rates of anxiety.\n\nMany current cases are likely to have resulted from an [[Mismatch theory|evolutionary mismatch]], which has been specifically termed a \"psychopathogical mismatch\". In evolutionary terms, a mismatch occurs when an individual possesses traits that were adapted for an environment that differs from the individual's current environment. For example, even though an anxiety reaction may have been evolved to help with life-threatening situations, for highly sensitized individuals in Westernized cultures simply hearing bad news can elicit a strong reaction.<ref name=\"Price 2003 223\u2013236\">{{cite journal|last=Price|first=John S.|title=Evolutionary aspects of anxiety disorders|journal=Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience|date=September 2003|volume=5|issue=3|pages=223\u2013236|pmc=3181631|pmid=22033473|doi=10.1016/B978-0-323-03354-1.50022-5}}</ref>\n\nAn evolutionary perspective may provide insight into alternatives to current clinical treatment methods for anxiety disorders. Simply knowing some anxiety is beneficial may alleviate some of the panic associated with mild conditions. Some researchers believe that, in theory, anxiety can be mediated by reducing a patient's feeling of vulnerability and then changing their appraisal of the situation.<ref name=\"Price 2003 223\u2013236\"/>\n\n==Mechanisms==\n===Biological===\nLow levels of [[gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABA]], a [[neurotransmitter]] that reduces activity in the central nervous system, contribute to anxiety.

In those with general anxiety disorder, these connections functionally seem to be less distinct, with greater [[gray matter]] in the central nucleus. Another difference is that the amygdala areas have decreased connectivity with the [[insular cortex|insula]] and [[cingulate cortex|cingulate]] areas that control general stimulus salience, while having greater connectivity with the [[parietal cortex]] and [[prefrontal cortex]] circuits that underlie [[executive function]]s.<ref name=\"Etkin\"/>\n\nThe latter suggests a compensation strategy for dysfunctional amygdala processing of anxiety.

They are prone to flare up at times of high stress and are frequently accompanied by physiological symptoms such as headache, sweating, muscle spasms, [[tachycardia]], [[palpitations]], and [[hypertension]], which in some cases lead to fatigue.\n\nIn casual discourse the words \"anxiety\" and \"fear\" are often used interchangeably; in clinical usage, they have distinct meanings: \"anxiety\" is defined as an unpleasant emotional state for which the cause is either not readily identified or perceived to be uncontrollable or unavoidable, whereas \"fear\" is an emotional and physiological response to a recognized external threat.<ref name=WHO2009>{{cite book|author= World Health Organization|date= 2009|title= Pharmacological Treatment of Mental Disorders in Primary Health Care|url= http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/44095/1/9789241547697_eng.pdf|location= Geneva|isbn= 978-92-4-154769-7|url-status= live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161120132530/http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/44095/1/9789241547697_eng.pdf|archivedate= 20 November 2016|df= dmy-all}}</ref> The umbrella term \"anxiety disorder\" refers to a number of specific disorders that include fears (phobias) or anxiety symptoms.<ref name= DSM5/>\n\nThe diagnosis of anxiety disorders is difficult because there are no objective [[biomarker (medicine)|biomarkers]], it is based on symptoms,<ref name=\"RoseDevine2014table1\">{{cite journal| vauthors=Rose M, Devine J| title=Assessment of patient-reported symptoms of anxiety | journal=Dialogues Clin Neurosci | year= 2014 | volume= 16 | issue= 2 | pages= 197\u2013211 (Table 1) | pmid=25152658 | pmc=4140513 |type= Review }}{{open access}}</ref> which typically need to be present at least six months, be more than would be expected for the situation, and decrease functioning.<ref name= DSM5/><ref name=Lancet2016/> Several generic anxiety questionnaires can be used to detect anxiety symptoms, such as the [[State-Trait Anxiety Inventory]] (STAI), the [[Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7]] (GAD-7), the [[Beck Anxiety Inventory]] (BAI), the [[Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale]], and the [[Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale]].<ref name=RoseDevine2014table1/> Other questionnaires combine anxiety and depression measurement, such as the [[Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale]], the [[Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale]] (HADS), the [[Patient Health Questionnaire]] (PHQ), and the [[Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System]] (PROMIS).<ref name=RoseDevine2014table1 /> Examples of specific anxiety questionnaires include the [[Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale]] (LSAS), the [[Social Interaction Anxiety Scale]] (SIAS), the [[Social Phobia Inventory]] (SPIN), the Social Phobia Scale (SPS), and the Social Anxiety Questionnaire (SAQ-A30).<ref name=RoseDevine2014table2>{{cite journal| vauthors=Rose M, Devine J| title=Assessment of patient-reported symptoms of anxiety | journal=Dialogues Clin Neurosci | year= 2014 | volume= 16 | issue= 2 | pages= 197\u2013211 (Table 2) | pmid=25152658 | pmc=4140513 |type= Review }}{{open access}}</ref>\n\nAnxiety disorders often occur along with other mental disorders, in particular [[depression (mood)|depression]], which may occur in as many as 60% of people with anxiety disorders.
