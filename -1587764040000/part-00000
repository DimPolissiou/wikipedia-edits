Localities include Bela Stena, Veliki Kr\u0161 and Jasova Ba\u010dija. [[Neolithic]] remains were discovered on the localities of Gornji Kaznovi\u0107i (Rosulja and Lug), Greblje, Tomovi\u0107ko Brdo and the Neolithic range of Beglu\u010dka.<ref name=\"Politika1\"/>\n\nThe mining fully developed during the [[Classical antiquity]]. The Romans began to dig the first proper mines and to build the surrounding settlements. The remains from this period include the archaeo-metallurgic complex Zaja\u010dak and the locality of Dobrinac in [[Rvati (Ra\u0161ka)|Rvati]]. Dobrinac originates from the 3rd or 4th century AD and it was the administrative center of the mining and metallurgic operations on the western slope of the mountain.<ref name=\"Politika1\"/>\n\nThe area remained an important mining center in the Middle Ages and by the 14th century it became the main mining area of Serbia. [[Emperor Du\u0161an]] visited the Silver Mountain in August 1336. In 1412 despot [[Stefan Lazarevi\u0107]] granted the Law on mines which mentions the mines of gold, silver, iron, copper, lead and zinc in the area. By that time, the mountain already hosted the colonies of [[Saxons in medieval Serbia|Saxons]], [[Kotor|Kotorans]] and [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusians]].<ref name=\"Politika1\"/> Besides old churches and monasteries like [[\u0110ur\u0111evi stupovi]], [[Studenica monastery]], [[Sopo\u0107ani]] and [[Gradac Monastery]],<ref name=\"npkopaonik1\"/> there are also several early and medieval fortresses locally, built by Serbian dynasties. The nearest Serbian medieval castle is [[Magli\u010d]].\n\nDuring the Ottoman period, from the 15th century, the mining gradually ceased, but they developed the thermal springs, building [[Turkish baths]]. Remains of one are found in modern [[spa]] of [[Jo\u0161ani\u010dka Banja]].<ref name=\"Politika1\"/>\n\nFirst scientific exploration of the mountain's flora came in 1836-38 when the geologist [[Ami Bou\u00e9]] visited the mountain. He made a collection of Kopaonik's plant life which is today kept in the [[Imperial Natural History Museum]] in [[Vienna]]. Botanist [[Josif Pan\u010di\u0107]] gave the greatest scientific contribution to the plant life on Kopaonik. In 1851 he explored the mountain for the first time, followed by another 18 expeditions.<ref name=\"Politika1\"/>\n\nDuring World War II the [[Yugoslav Partisans]] were active in the region.<ref>{{cite book|author=Branko N.

The nearest Serbian medieval castle is [[Magli\u010d]].\n\nDuring the Ottoman period, from the 15th century, the mining gradually ceased, but they developed the thermal springs, building [[Turkish baths]].

The film was #57 on the year-end list of the top-grossing films of 1966. It was titled ''California Holiday'' in the UK.\n\n==Plot==\nMike McCoy ([[Elvis Presley]]), the lead singer for a traveling band who is also a part-time race car driver, enjoys his carefree single life, which is threatened by three different women who seek to marry him.\n\nEnter Cynthia Foxhugh ([[Shelley Fabares]]), a spoiled heiress and \"daddy's girl,\" who is determined to get what she wants, no matter the cost. Such as was the case when Cynthia's millionaire father Howard ([[Carl Betz]]) tricks Mike and his band into interrupting their music tour to travel to Santa Barbara and serenade Cynthia with \"[[Am I Ready]]\" for her birthday. Cynthia becomes first of the three women who want to marry Mike. Also, apparently knowing about Mike's racing skills, Howard is determined to hire Mike to drive Howard's Fox Five car in an upcoming road race, but Mike prefers to race his own car, a [[AC Cobra|Cobra 427]] sports car, which he tows around the region with his 1929 Model J [[Duesenberg]].\n\nMeanwhile, Mike is stalked and spied upon by Diana St. Clair ([[Diane McBain]]), an author of books for women about men. Diana is in the process of writing her new book, ''The Perfect American Male'', and uses Mike as one of her subjects. Actually, she later reveals to Mike that he is the \"perfect American male,\" thereby planning on Mike to marry her\u2014to the point of already making wedding arrangements.\n\nThe female drummer of Mike's band, Les ([[Deborah Walley]]), is looked upon by Mike and the other band members as a [[tomboy]], and becomes fed up with such treatment. Mike and his other band members are taken aback when at a party, Les picks her moment and reveals her true feminine side, walking back out from a room dressed up in an evening dress. She reveals herself as the third woman who wishes to marry Mike.\n\nFaced with this predicament, Mike must decide which of the three women he will marry\u2014after the race (which Mike wins in a car he does not even own). So, he decides to marry all three of them\u2014to other men. Mike marries Cynthia to Phillip ([[Warren Berlinger]]), a nervous employee of Howard's who is prone to fainting (he had a secret crush on Cynthia since he has known her, which he finally picks up the nerve to tell her). Next, Mike marries Diana to Howard, who fell in love with each other after they met at one of Mike's parties. And finally, Mike marries Les to Lt. Tracy Richards ([[Will Hutchins]]), a police officer whom Les won her way to his heart through his stomach (he likes her gourmet cooking).
