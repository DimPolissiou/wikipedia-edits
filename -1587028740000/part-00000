He started performing at a very young age but spent most of his childhood away from music until his early twenties, when he received a piano from his mother. He recorded a cover of Chris Brown's \"Crawl\" and, in November 2009, uploaded the clip to YouTube. Its popularity encouraged him to continue uploading covers, including a medley of songs from Drake's Take Care released the same day as the album. On September 11, 2012 -- his birthday -- he released My Life, a mixtape featuring some of his first originals written with Cody Tarpley. The following year he signed to Republic, which remastered and re-released My Life. SoMo's self-titled debut album, the majority of which was produced by Mick Schultz (Jeremih), was released in April 2014 and debuted at number six on the Billboard 200. My Life II, featuring an appearance from Trey Songz on the single \"Hide & Freak,\" followed in September 2015. Between May 2016 and January 2017, SoMo released three tracks -- \"Control,\" \"First,\" and \"Play\" -- that were previews of his upcoming second studio album. That album, titled The Answers, finally arrived in March 2017. A mere six months later, SoMo released the mixtape, My Life III, via his own SoMo, LLC imprint. Throughout 2018, he remained prolific, releasing a series of singles that later appeared on his third proper solo album, A Beautiful November, released later that year.\n\n==Career==\nIn 2009, SoMo started recording covers in [[Denton, Texas]].

He started performing at a very young age but spent most of his childhood away from music until his early twenties, when he received a piano from his mother. He recorded a cover of Chris Brown's \"Crawl\" and, in November 2009, uploaded the clip to YouTube. Its popularity encouraged him to continue uploading covers, including a medley of songs from Drake's Take Care released the same day as the album. On September 11, 2012 -- his birthday -- he released My Life, a mixtape featuring some of his first originals written with Cody Tarpley. The following year he signed to Republic, which remastered and re-released My Life. SoMo's self-titled debut album, the majority of which was produced by Mick Schultz (Jeremih), was released in April 2014 and debuted at number six on the Billboard 200. My Life II, featuring an appearance from Trey Songz on the single \"Hide & Freak,\" followed in September 2015. Between May 2016 and January 2017, SoMo released three tracks -- \"Control,\" \"First,\" and \"Play\" -- that were previews of his upcoming second studio album. That album, titled The Answers, finally arrived in March 2017. A mere six months later, SoMo released the mixtape, My Life III, via his own SoMo, LLC imprint. Throughout 2018, he remained prolific, releasing a series of singles that later appeared on his third proper solo album, A Beautiful November, released later that year.\n\n==Career==\nIn 2009, SoMo started recording covers in [[Denton, Texas]].

Measuring approximately {{convert|1|mi|km}} long by {{convert|0.33|mi|km|abbr=}} wide, Hart Island is part of the [[Pelham Islands]] archipelago, to the east of [[City Island, Bronx|City Island]].\n\nThe island's first public use was as a training ground for the [[United States Colored Troops]] in 1864. Since then, Hart Island has been the location of a [[American Civil War prison camps|Union Civil War prison camp]], a [[psychiatric institution]], a [[tuberculosis sanatorium]], a [[potter's field]] with mass burials, a homeless shelter, a boys' [[reformatory]], a jail, and a drug rehabilitation center. Several other structures, such as an amusement park, were planned for Hart Island but not built. During the [[Cold War (1953\u20131962)|Cold War]], [[Nike missile|Nike defense missiles]] were stationed on Hart Island. The island was intermittently used as a prison and a homeless shelter until 1967, and the last inhabited structures were abandoned in 1977. The island now serves as the city's potter's field, run by the [[New York City Department of Correction]] until 2019, when the [[New York City Council]] voted to transfer jurisdiction to the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]].\n\nThe remains of more than one million people are buried on Hart Island, though since the first decade of the 21st century, there are fewer than 1,500 burials a year. Burials on Hart Island include individuals who were not claimed by their families or did not have private funerals; the homeless and the indigent; and mass burials of disease victims.\n\nAccess to the island is restricted by the Department of Correction, which operates an infrequent ferryboat service and imposes strict visitation quotas. Burials are conducted by inmates from the [[Rikers Island]] jail. The Hart Island Project, a public charity founded by visual artist Melinda Hunt, has tried to improve access to the island and make burial records more easily available. Prior to 2019, several laws to transfer jurisdiction to the Parks Department had been proposed to ease public access to Hart Island.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Etymology ==\nThere are numerous theories about the possible origins for the island's name.

Measuring approximately {{convert|1|mi|km}} long by {{convert|0.33|mi|km|abbr=}} wide, Hart Island is part of the [[Pelham Islands]] archipelago, to the east of [[City Island, Bronx|City Island]].\n\nThe island's first public use was as a training ground for the [[United States Colored Troops]] in 1864. Since then, Hart Island has been the location of a [[American Civil War prison camps|Union Civil War prison camp]], a [[psychiatric institution]], a [[tuberculosis sanatorium]], a [[potter's field]] with mass burials, a homeless shelter, a boys' [[reformatory]], a jail, and a drug rehabilitation center. Several other structures, such as an amusement park, were planned for Hart Island but not built. During the [[Cold War (1953\u20131962)|Cold War]], [[Nike missile|Nike defense missiles]] were stationed on Hart Island. The island was intermittently used as a prison and a homeless shelter until 1967, and the last inhabited structures were abandoned in 1977. The island now serves as the city's potter's field, run by the [[New York City Department of Correction]] until 2019, when the [[New York City Council]] voted to transfer jurisdiction to the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]].\n\nThe remains of more than one million people are buried on Hart Island, though since the first decade of the 21st century, there are fewer than 1,500 burials a year. Burials on Hart Island include individuals who were not claimed by their families or did not have private funerals; the homeless and the indigent; and mass burials of disease victims.\n\nAccess to the island is restricted by the Department of Correction, which operates an infrequent ferryboat service and imposes strict visitation quotas. Burials are conducted by inmates from the [[Rikers Island]] jail. The Hart Island Project, a public charity founded by visual artist Melinda Hunt, has tried to improve access to the island and make burial records more easily available. Prior to 2019, several laws to transfer jurisdiction to the Parks Department had been proposed to ease public access to Hart Island.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Etymology ==\nThere are numerous theories about the possible origins for the island's name.

Pakistani politicians and government officials have refused to accept these nearly 300,000 stranded Pakistanis of Bihari origin due to inability to absorb such a large number of immigrants at the moment.\n\nIn May 2008, a Bangladeshi court ruled that Biharis who were either [[minor (law)|minors]] in 1971 or born after 1971 are Bangladeshi citizens and have the right to vote.<ref name=reuters051908>[http://in.reuters.com/article/southAsiaNews/idINIndia-33636220080518 \"Court rules that young Biharis are Bangladesh citizens\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119060855/http://in.reuters.com/article/southAsiaNews/idINIndia-33636220080518 |date=19 November 2016 }}.
