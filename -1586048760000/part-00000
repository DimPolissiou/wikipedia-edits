It was released on October 31, 1984, by [[Sire Records]] as the album's [[lead single]]. The song was written by [[Tom Kelly (musician)|Tom Kelly]] and [[Billy Steinberg]], and produced by [[Nile Rodgers]]; Steinberg said that the song was inspired by his personal experiences of romance. \"Like a Virgin\" was chosen for Madonna by Michael Ostin of [[Warner Bros. Records]] after listening to a demo sung by Kelly. Rodgers initially felt that the song did not have a sufficient [[Hook (music)|hook]], but subsequently changed his opinion after the song was stuck in his head.\n\nMusically, \"Like a Virgin\" is a dance-oriented song, composed of two hooks. Madonna's voice is heard in a high [[register (music)|register]] while a continuous arrangement of synths are heard along the [[bassline]]. The song's lyrics are ambiguous, consisting of hidden innuendos and open to various interpretations. \"Like a Virgin\" received positive reviews from music critics, who frequently called it as one of the defining songs for Madonna. It became her first number-one single on the [[record chart]]s in Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan, and the United States, while reaching the top ten elsewhere.\n\nThe song's [[music video]] portrayed Madonna sailing down the canals of Venice in a gondola, as well as roaming around a palace wearing a white wedding dress. With the video, scholars noted Madonna's portrayal of a sexually independent and strong woman, similarity of a man wearing a lion's mask to that of [[Mark the Evangelist|Saint Mark]] and the link between the eroticism in the video and the vitality of Venice. Madonna has performed the song in seven of her [[List of Madonna live performances|concert tours]]. Most of the time, her performances of \"Like a Virgin\" were associated with strong reaction and uproar from the media.\n\n\"Like a Virgin\" has been covered by a number of artists and has appeared in or been referenced in feature films such as ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'', ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' and ''[[Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason (film)|Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason]]''. Family groups sought to ban it as they believed the song promoted sex outside or without marriage. On the other hand, Madonna's public persona of an indomitable, sexually unashamed, supremely confident woman was widely accepted by the younger generation who emulated her style and fashion. Scholars have credited \"Like a Virgin\" as the song which cemented her position as a [[Pop icon|pop culture icon]].\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Tom Kelly, ASCAP concert, 2011 cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Tom Kelly (musician)|Tom Kelly]] (pictured) co-wrote the song with [[Billy Steinberg]]]]\n\"Like a Virgin\" was written by [[Billy Steinberg]] and [[Tom Kelly (musician)|Tom Kelly]]. The idea for the song originated when Steinberg was living at his father's vineyards in the [[Coachella Valley]], and driving a red pickup truck one day.<ref name=\"digi\"/> In an interview with the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Steinberg explained that the song was not written for Madonna or any female singer but was inspired by his personal experiences.<ref name=\"bronson\"/> At that time Steinberg had just come out of an emotionally challenging relationship, and he had met someone new. That inspired the lyrics for \"Like a Virgin\" about how he coped with the difficult situation. When he took the song to Kelly, they decided that it would be a [[Sentimental ballad|sensitive ballad]], however they could not decide how the word \"virgin\" would fit in it.<ref name=\"digi\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/music/feature/a812470/the-surprising-stories-behind-6-of-madonnas-biggest-hits/|title=The surprising stories behind 6 of Madonna's biggest hits|last=Kheraj|first=Alim|date=October 29, 2016|accessdate=October 30, 2016|work=[[Digital Spy]]}}</ref> Steinberg elaborated: \"I wasn't just trying to get that racy word ''virgin'' in a lyric. I was saying ... that I may not really be a virgin\u2014I've been battered romantically and emotionally like many people\u2014but I'm starting a new relationship and it just feels so good, it's healing all the wounds and making me feel like I've never done this before, because it's so much deeper and more profound than anything I've ever felt.\"<ref name=\"bronson\">{{harvnb|Bronson|2003|p=600}}</ref>\n\nKelly recorded the demo, and invited Michael Ostin of Warner Bros. Records' [[Artist and repertoire|A&R]] department to his house to listen to it. Steinberg and Kelly played four or five tunes for Ostin, and further discussed \"Like a Virgin\"{{spaced ndash}}they were not sure for which artist the song would be suitable.<ref name=\"bronson\"/> Due to meet with Madonna the next day to discuss her second album, Ostin intended on playing the demo to her, believing the lyrics and the groove of the song were perfect for Madonna. \"When I played it for Madonna she went crazy, and knew instantly it was a song for her and that she could make a great record out of it,\" Ostin recalled.<ref name=\"bronson\"/> In 2009, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' interviewer Austin Scaggs asked Madonna what her first impressions were after listening to the demos of \"Like a Virgin\" and \"[[Material Girl]]\". Madonna replied:\n<blockquote>I liked them both because they were ironic and provocative at the same time but also unlike me. I am not a materialistic person, and I certainly wasn't a virgin, and, by the way, how can you be ''like a virgin''? I liked the play on words; I thought they were clever. They're so geeky, they're cool. I never realized they would become my signature songs, especially the second one.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Scaggs|first=Austin|date=October 29, 2009|title=Madonna Looks Back: The Rolling Stone Interview|journal=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=[[Jann Wenner]]|location=San Francisco|issue=1090|page=51|issn=0035-791X}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Recording and production==\n[[File:Avatar-studios.jpg|thumbnail|alt=A pale colored building with small windows|\"Like a Virgin\" was recorded at Power Station Studios in New York City]]\nIn mid-1984, Madonna met producer Nile Rodgers at the [[Avatar Studios|Power Station studios]] (now Avatar Studios) in New York.<ref name=\"sound\">{{cite web|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/sep07/articles/classictracks_0907.htm|title=Classic Tracks: Madonna 'Like A Virgin'|last=Buskin|first=Richard|date=September 2007|work=[[Sound on Sound]]|publisher=SOS Publications Group|accessdate=February 18, 2010}}</ref> Rodgers initially did not want Madonna to record \"Like a Virgin\", as he felt that the lyric 'like a virgin' was not a terrific hook; according to him it was not an all-time catch phrase.<ref name=\"bronson\"/> Rodgers dismissed the song after hearing the demo, which he thought sounded \"really stupid and retarded\". Later, Rodgers had second thoughts: \"It's weird because I couldn't get it out of my head after I played it, even though I didn't really like it. It sounded really [[Bubblegum pop|bubble-gummy]] to me, but it grew on me. I really started to like it. [...] But, my first reaction to it was, 'This is really queer.'\"<ref name=\"rosen\">{{harvnb|Rosen|1996|p=283}}</ref> Rodgers credits Madonna with recognizing the song's potential. He later said: \"I handed my apology to Madonna and said, 'you know... if it's so catchy that it stayed in my head for four days, it must be something. So let's do it.'\" Hence the song was finally recorded.<ref name=\"bronson\"/><ref name=\"rosen\"/> Steinberg reflected on the recording process and commented that:\n<blockquote>\nWhen Madonna recorded it, even as our demo faded out, on the fade you could hear Tom saying, \"When your heart beats, and you hold me, and you love me...\" That was the last thing you heard as our demo faded. Madonna must have listened to it very, very carefully because her record ends with the exact same little ad-libs that our demo did. That rarely happens that someone studies your demo so carefully that they use all that stuff. We were sort of flattered how carefully she followed our demo on that.<ref name=\"bronson\"/><br>\n</blockquote>\nJason Corsaro, the record's [[Audio engineering|audio engineer]], persuaded Rodgers to use [[digital recording]], a new technique at the time which Corsaro believed was going to be the future of recording because test pressings always sounded consistent.<ref name=\"sound\"/> To ensure this, Corsaro used a [[Digital Audio Stationary Head|Sony 3324 24-track digital tape recorder]] and a [[PCM adaptor#Models of PCM adaptors|Sony F1 two-track]] for the stereo mix. Madonna recorded the lead parts in a small, wooden, high-ceilinged piano room at the back of Studio C, also known as Power Station's \"[[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] room\".<ref name=\"sound\"/> Corsaro then placed [[Gobo (recording)|gobos]] around her while using the top capsule of a [[AKG Acoustics#Microphones|stereo AKG C24 tube microphone]], with a [[Schoeps]] [[microphone preamplifier]] and a Pultec equalizer. Once the track met with everybody's approval, [[Robert Sabino]] added the keyboard parts, playing mostly a [[Sequential Circuits Prophet-5]], as well as some [[Rhodes piano]] and [[Piano|acoustic piano]], while Rodgers also played a [[Synclavier]]. Madonna, although not required, was present every minute of the recording sessions and the mixing process, Corsaro commented: \"Nile was there most of the time, but she was there all of the time. She never left\".<ref name=\"sound\"/>\n\n==Composition==\n{{listen\n | filename    = Madonna_- Like a Virgin.ogg\n | title       = \"Like a Virgin\"\n | description = A 20 second sample of the song.

[[Alfred Music Publishing|Alfred Publishing]]|accessdate=January 7, 2010}}</ref> According to Rikky Rooksby, the [[bassline]] on the intro is a re-working of the [[musical notation|three-note]] bass motif present in the [[Four Tops]]' 1965 song \"[[I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)]]\", where Chuck Berry provided the [[chord progression|chord]] arrangement. The bassline also has some similarity with [[Michael Jackson]]'s \"[[Billie Jean]]\" especially during the second [[Song structure (popular music)|verse]]. Madonna sings the song in her high register while drum arrangement by Tony Thompson is heard alongside the bassline, which is also supported by a synthesizer arrangement, giving it a [[chord progression#Circle progressions|circular progression]] through all the seven diatonic chords of I\u2013IV\u2013vii<sup>o</sup>\u2013iii\u2013vi\u2013ii\u2013V\u2013I.<ref name=\"rook1\"/>\n\nRegarding the lyrics, Madonna had commented: \"I like innuendo, I like irony, I like the way things can be taken on different levels.\" This statement highlighted the ambiguity of the lyrics of the song, which is hung on the word 'like'.<ref name=\"rook1\"/> Rooksby interpreted the meaning of the song in different ways to different people. He said that for girls who are really virgins, the song encouraged them to hold their compose before they engage in their very first sexual moment/act. For sexually experienced girls, the song meant that they would be able to re-live the feelings of their first sexual encounter all over again.<ref name=\"rook1\"/> For boys, the song presented a [[narcissism|narcissistic]] image of them making the girl/boy forget her/his past encounters and enjoy their sexual moment/act as if for the very first time.<ref name=\"rook1\"/>\n\n==Critical reception==\n\"Like a Virgin\" is one of Madonna's most famous singles, and was met with predominantly positive critical reception. [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] from [[Allmusic]] said that \"Like a Virgin\" was a definitive statement. He added that the song, and \"[[Material Girl]]\" from the same album, made Madonna an icon. He added that both overshadowed the rest of the record, \"because they are a perfect match of theme and sound.\"<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r12204|pure_url=yes}}|title=Like a Virgin > Overview |last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|date=September 13, 2002|publisher=[[Allmusic]].

Madonna was portrayed as a knowing virgin, a figment of the pornographic mind, as she walked through marble rooms, wearing a wedding gown. It alternated with scenes of a provocative-looking Madonna on board a [[gondola]].<ref>{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=765}}</ref> She commented, \"[Lambert] wanted me to be the modern-day, worldly-wise girl that I am. But then we wanted to go back in time and use myself as an actual virgin.\"<ref name=\"mick\"/> The video starts with Madonna boarding on a boat from the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] and travels to Venice. As she steps down into the city, she moves like a stripper and undulated sinuously. She wears a black dress and blue pants with a number of Christian symbol embedded jewelry around her neck.<ref name=\"plant\">{{harvnb|Plant|2002|p=415}}</ref> She sings the song at full volume as she watches a lion walking between the columns of the [[Punta della Dogana]] of Venice.<ref name=\"plant\"/>\n\nA number of game-playing involving carnival masks, men and lions are portrayed with allusions to eighteenth-century practices and Saint Mark.<ref>{{harvnb|Guilbert|2002|p=78}}</ref> Sheila Whiteley, author of ''Women and popular music: sexuality, identity, and subjectivity'', felt that Madonna's image signified a denial of sexual knowledge, but also portrayed her in simulated writhing on a gondola, thus underpinning the simulation of deceit. The intrusion of a male lion, confirmed the underlying [[Zoophilia|bestial]] discourse of both mythological fairy tale and pornographic sex. Whiteley observed that in the video, Madonna's lover wears the lion's mask and while cavorting with him, Madonna sheds the veneer of innocence and shows her propensity for wild animal passions. Having instilled desire, metaphorically she turns her lover into a Beast.<ref>{{harvnb|Whiteley|2000|p=136}}</ref> Madonna commented about shooting with the lion:\n<blockquote>\n\"The lion didn't do anything he was supposed to do, and I ended up leaning against this pillar with his head in my crotch... I thought he was going to take a bite out of me so I lifted the veil I was wearing and had a stare-down with him and he opened his mouth and let out this huge roar. I got so frightened my heart fell in my shoe. When he finally walked away, the director yelled 'Cut' and I had to take a long breather. But I could really relate to the lion. I feel like in a past life I was a lion or a cat or something.\"<ref name=\"mick\">{{harvnb|Michael|2004|p=65}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n===Reception and analysis===\n{{Quote box|width=25%|align=left|quote=\"For 'Like a Virgin' I said 'Lets do it in Venice!'

It turned into a huge party.\"|source=\u2014Director Mary Lambert on the filming of the video.<ref>{{harvnb|Tannenbaum|Marks|2011|p=15}}</ref>\n}}\nWith the video, scholars noted the expression of Venetian vitality in it. Author Margaret Plant (2002) commented: \"With the lion of Saint Mark and the virginal city to the forefront, old sacrosanct Venice was propelled into a pop world of high-energy gyration, and endless circulation.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Plant|2002|p=413}}</ref> She also noted that Saint Mark was a symbol of a time when sexual crime was punished severely in Venice and acts of rape, homosexuality and fornication incurred the loss of a nose, a hand or sometimes life itself. Madonna appeared to challenge such brutality and stretch the boundaries of tolerance in the video. As the lion-man carried Madonna to the Venetian palace, it symbolized an instance of the Saint taking the simulated Virgin, where Madonna became a symbol for [[Republic of Venice|La Serenissima]], the Republic itself.<ref>{{harvnb|Plant|2002|p=419}}</ref>\n\nPlant also noted that Madonna, in the video, restored the energy and eroticism of Venice, which had its name taken from Venus in familiar elision. As she exchanged her blue top for a black one during the video, Madonna demonstrated her mastery and bravery of the city, which had a reputation of turning out its visitors as victims.<ref name=\"plant\"/> Carol Clerk (2002) commented that with the video, \"Madonna's days as a cheap and cheerful video star were over.

Clerk noted the song attracted an unprecedented level of attention from social groups compared to any female singer's song. \"The main problem was that most of them listened superficially to the lyric of the song, imagining that it detailed or called on an innocent's sexual initiation.\" While one section of the population were outraged at the scandal, others were taking joy at the very notion of a virginal Madonna, who retorted by saying,\n<blockquote>\nI was surprised by how people reacted to \"Like a Virgin\" because when I did that song, to me, I was singing about how something made me feel a certain way&nbsp;\u2013 brand-new and fresh&nbsp;\u2013 and everyone interpreted it as I don't want to be a virgin anymore. Fuck my brains out! That's not what I sang at all. \"Like a Virgin\" was always absolutely ambiguous.<ref name=\"rook1\"/><ref name=\"clerk\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nBiographer [[Andrew Morton (writer)|Andrew Morton]] noted that most of Madonna's admirers were females, who were born-and-brought-up with an image of old-fashioned stereotypes of women as virginal brides, or as whores, or with feminist values that rejected the use of a woman's looks for her self-advancement.<ref name=\"morton\">{{harvnb|Morton|2002|p=766}}</ref> Author William McKeen of ''Rock and roll is here to stay: an anthology'' commented that with the song, Madonna became the last word in attitude and fashion for young girls of that time. He compared that image of Madonna with that of [[Barbie]]. McKeen explained that Madonna intermixed middle-class ideas of femininity with examples of what femininity meant to her, which was having equal opportunity. She offered an aggressive sexuality that implied it was acceptable for women not only to initiate relationships, but also enjoy them.<ref>{{harvnb|McKeen|2000|p=232}}</ref> In addition, according to Morton, at a time when eighties fashions were promoting flat-chested, stick-thin women as ideals of beauty, the more curvaceous Madonna made average girls feel that it was fine to be in the shape they were. A new word called '[[Madonna wannabe]]' was introduced to describe the thousands of girls who tried to emulate Madonna's style. University professors, gender-studies experts and feminists earnestly started discussing her role as a post-modernist style and cultural icon. According to author Debbi Voller, \"Like a Virgin\" gave rise to the icon Madonna.<ref name=\"morton\"/>\n\nThe performance of \"Like a Virgin\" at the first MTV Video Music Awards is considered by MTV as \"one of the most iconic pop performances of all time\". Christina Garibaldi from the channel noted that the performance \"helped make the Video Music Awards a household name... and simultaneously set the bar for every other performer to come after her.

It was released on October 31, 1984, by [[Sire Records]] as the album's [[lead single]]. The song was written by [[Tom Kelly (musician)|Tom Kelly]] and [[Billy Steinberg]], and produced by [[Nile Rodgers]]; Steinberg said that the song was inspired by his personal experiences of romance. \"Like a Virgin\" was chosen for Madonna by Michael Ostin of [[Warner Bros. Records]] after listening to a demo sung by Kelly. Rodgers initially felt that the song did not have a sufficient [[Hook (music)|hook]], but subsequently changed his opinion after the song was stuck in his head.\n\nMusically, \"Like a Virgin\" is a dance-oriented song, composed of two hooks. Madonna's voice is heard in a high [[register (music)|register]] while a continuous arrangement of synths are heard along the [[bassline]]. The song's lyrics are ambiguous, consisting of hidden innuendos and open to various interpretations. \"Like a Virgin\" received positive reviews from music critics, who frequently called it as one of the defining songs for Madonna. It became her first number-one single on the [[record chart]]s in Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan, and the United States, while reaching the top ten elsewhere.\n\nThe song's [[music video]] portrayed Madonna sailing down the canals of Venice in a gondola, as well as roaming around a palace wearing a white wedding dress. With the video, scholars noted Madonna's portrayal of a sexually independent and strong woman, similarity of a man wearing a lion's mask to that of [[Mark the Evangelist|Saint Mark]] and the link between the eroticism in the video and the vitality of Venice. Madonna has performed the song in seven of her [[List of Madonna live performances|concert tours]]. Most of the time, her performances of \"Like a Virgin\" were associated with strong reaction and uproar from the media.\n\n\"Like a Virgin\" has been covered by a number of artists and has appeared in or been referenced in feature films such as ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'', ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' and ''[[Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason (film)|Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason]]''. Family groups sought to ban it as they believed the song promoted sex outside or without marriage. On the other hand, Madonna's public persona of an indomitable, sexually unashamed, supremely confident woman was widely accepted by the younger generation who emulated her style and fashion. Scholars have credited \"Like a Virgin\" as the song which cemented her position as a [[Pop icon|pop culture icon]].\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Tom Kelly, ASCAP concert, 2011 cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Tom Kelly (musician)|Tom Kelly]] (pictured) co-wrote the song with [[Billy Steinberg]]]]\n\"Like a Virgin\" was written by [[Billy Steinberg]] and [[Tom Kelly (musician)|Tom Kelly]]. The idea for the song originated when Steinberg was living at his father's vineyards in the [[Coachella Valley]], and driving a red pickup truck one day.<ref name=\"digi\"/> In an interview with the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Steinberg explained that the song was not written for Madonna or any female singer but was inspired by his personal experiences.<ref name=\"bronson\"/> At that time Steinberg had just come out of an emotionally challenging relationship, and he had met someone new. That inspired the lyrics for \"Like a Virgin\" about how he coped with the difficult situation. When he took the song to Kelly, they decided that it would be a [[Sentimental ballad|sensitive ballad]], however they could not decide how the word \"virgin\" would fit in it.<ref name=\"digi\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/music/feature/a812470/the-surprising-stories-behind-6-of-madonnas-biggest-hits/|title=The surprising stories behind 6 of Madonna's biggest hits|last=Kheraj|first=Alim|date=October 29, 2016|accessdate=October 30, 2016|work=[[Digital Spy]]}}</ref> Steinberg elaborated: \"I wasn't just trying to get that racy word ''virgin'' in a lyric. I was saying ... that I may not really be a virgin\u2014I've been battered romantically and emotionally like many people\u2014but I'm starting a new relationship and it just feels so good, it's healing all the wounds and making me feel like I've never done this before, because it's so much deeper and more profound than anything I've ever felt.\"<ref name=\"bronson\">{{harvnb|Bronson|2003|p=600}}</ref>\n\nKelly recorded the demo, and invited Michael Ostin of Warner Bros. Records' [[Artist and repertoire|A&R]] department to his house to listen to it. Steinberg and Kelly played four or five tunes for Ostin, and further discussed \"Like a Virgin\"{{spaced ndash}}they were not sure for which artist the song would be suitable.<ref name=\"bronson\"/> Due to meet with Madonna the next day to discuss her second album, Ostin intended on playing the demo to her, believing the lyrics and the groove of the song were perfect for Madonna. \"When I played it for Madonna she went crazy, and knew instantly it was a song for her and that she could make a great record out of it,\" Ostin recalled.<ref name=\"bronson\"/> In 2009, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' interviewer Austin Scaggs asked Madonna what her first impressions were after listening to the demos of \"Like a Virgin\" and \"[[Material Girl]]\". Madonna replied:\n<blockquote>I liked them both because they were ironic and provocative at the same time but also unlike me. I am not a materialistic person, and I certainly wasn't a virgin, and, by the way, how can you be ''like a virgin''? I liked the play on words; I thought they were clever. They're so geeky, they're cool. I never realized they would become my signature songs, especially the second one.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Scaggs|first=Austin|date=October 29, 2009|title=Madonna Looks Back: The Rolling Stone Interview|journal=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=[[Jann Wenner]]|location=San Francisco|issue=1090|page=51|issn=0035-791X}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Recording and production==\n[[File:Avatar-studios.jpg|thumbnail|alt=A pale colored building with small windows|\"Like a Virgin\" was recorded at Power Station Studios in New York City]]\nIn mid-1984, Madonna met producer Nile Rodgers at the [[Avatar Studios|Power Station studios]] (now Avatar Studios) in New York.<ref name=\"sound\">{{cite web|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/sep07/articles/classictracks_0907.htm|title=Classic Tracks: Madonna 'Like A Virgin'|last=Buskin|first=Richard|date=September 2007|work=[[Sound on Sound]]|publisher=SOS Publications Group|accessdate=February 18, 2010}}</ref> Rodgers initially did not want Madonna to record \"Like a Virgin\", as he felt that the lyric 'like a virgin' was not a terrific hook; according to him it was not an all-time catch phrase.<ref name=\"bronson\"/> Rodgers dismissed the song after hearing the demo, which he thought sounded \"really stupid and retarded\". Later, Rodgers had second thoughts: \"It's weird because I couldn't get it out of my head after I played it, even though I didn't really like it. It sounded really [[Bubblegum pop|bubble-gummy]] to me, but it grew on me. I really started to like it. [...] But, my first reaction to it was, 'This is really queer.'\"<ref name=\"rosen\">{{harvnb|Rosen|1996|p=283}}</ref> Rodgers credits Madonna with recognizing the song's potential. He later said: \"I handed my apology to Madonna and said, 'you know... if it's so catchy that it stayed in my head for four days, it must be something. So let's do it.'\" Hence the song was finally recorded.<ref name=\"bronson\"/><ref name=\"rosen\"/> Steinberg reflected on the recording process and commented that:\n<blockquote>\nWhen Madonna recorded it, even as our demo faded out, on the fade you could hear Tom saying, \"When your heart beats, and you hold me, and you love me...\" That was the last thing you heard as our demo faded. Madonna must have listened to it very, very carefully because her record ends with the exact same little ad-libs that our demo did. That rarely happens that someone studies your demo so carefully that they use all that stuff. We were sort of flattered how carefully she followed our demo on that.<ref name=\"bronson\"/><br>\n</blockquote>\nJason Corsaro, the record's [[Audio engineering|audio engineer]], persuaded Rodgers to use [[digital recording]], a new technique at the time which Corsaro believed was going to be the future of recording because test pressings always sounded consistent.<ref name=\"sound\"/> To ensure this, Corsaro used a [[Digital Audio Stationary Head|Sony 3324 24-track digital tape recorder]] and a [[PCM adaptor#Models of PCM adaptors|Sony F1 two-track]] for the stereo mix. Madonna recorded the lead parts in a small, wooden, high-ceilinged piano room at the back of Studio C, also known as Power Station's \"[[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] room\".<ref name=\"sound\"/> Corsaro then placed [[Gobo (recording)|gobos]] around her while using the top capsule of a [[AKG Acoustics#Microphones|stereo AKG C24 tube microphone]], with a [[Schoeps]] [[microphone preamplifier]] and a Pultec equalizer. Once the track met with everybody's approval, [[Robert Sabino]] added the keyboard parts, playing mostly a [[Sequential Circuits Prophet-5]], as well as some [[Rhodes piano]] and [[Piano|acoustic piano]], while Rodgers also played a [[Synclavier]]. Madonna, although not required, was present every minute of the recording sessions and the mixing process, Corsaro commented: \"Nile was there most of the time, but she was there all of the time. She never left\".<ref name=\"sound\"/>\n\n==Composition==\n{{listen\n | filename    = Madonna_- Like a Virgin.ogg\n | title       = \"Like a Virgin\"\n | description = A 20 second sample of the song.

[[Alfred Music Publishing|Alfred Publishing]]|accessdate=January 7, 2010}}</ref> According to Rikky Rooksby, the [[bassline]] on the intro is a re-working of the [[musical notation|three-note]] bass motif present in the [[Four Tops]]' 1965 song \"[[I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)]]\", where Chuck Berry provided the [[chord progression|chord]] arrangement. The bassline also has some similarity with [[Michael Jackson]]'s \"[[Billie Jean]]\" especially during the second [[Song structure (popular music)|verse]]. Madonna sings the song in her high register while drum arrangement by Tony Thompson is heard alongside the bassline, which is also supported by a synthesizer arrangement, giving it a [[chord progression#Circle progressions|circular progression]] through all the seven diatonic chords of I\u2013IV\u2013vii<sup>o</sup>\u2013iii\u2013vi\u2013ii\u2013V\u2013I.<ref name=\"rook1\"/>\n\nRegarding the lyrics, Madonna had commented: \"I like innuendo, I like irony, I like the way things can be taken on different levels.\" This statement highlighted the ambiguity of the lyrics of the song, which is hung on the word 'like'.<ref name=\"rook1\"/> Rooksby interpreted the meaning of the song in different ways to different people. He said that for girls who are really virgins, the song encouraged them to hold their compose before they engage in their very first sexual moment/act. For sexually experienced girls, the song meant that they would be able to re-live the feelings of their first sexual encounter all over again.<ref name=\"rook1\"/> For boys, the song presented a [[narcissism|narcissistic]] image of them making the girl/boy forget her/his past encounters and enjoy their sexual moment/act as if for the very first time.<ref name=\"rook1\"/>\n\n==Critical reception==\n\"Like a Virgin\" is one of Madonna's most famous singles, and was met with predominantly positive critical reception. [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] from [[Allmusic]] said that \"Like a Virgin\" was a definitive statement. He added that the song, and \"[[Material Girl]]\" from the same album, made Madonna an icon. He added that both overshadowed the rest of the record, \"because they are a perfect match of theme and sound.\"<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r12204|pure_url=yes}}|title=Like a Virgin > Overview |last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|date=September 13, 2002|publisher=[[Allmusic]].

Madonna was portrayed as a knowing virgin, a figment of the pornographic mind, as she walked through marble rooms, wearing a wedding gown. It alternated with scenes of a provocative-looking Madonna on board a [[gondola]].<ref>{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=765}}</ref> She commented, \"[Lambert] wanted me to be the modern-day, worldly-wise girl that I am. But then we wanted to go back in time and use myself as an actual virgin.\"<ref name=\"mick\"/> The video starts with Madonna boarding on a boat from the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] and travels to Venice. As she steps down into the city, she moves like a stripper and undulated sinuously. She wears a black dress and blue pants with a number of Christian symbol embedded jewelry around her neck.<ref name=\"plant\">{{harvnb|Plant|2002|p=415}}</ref> She sings the song at full volume as she watches a lion walking between the columns of the [[Punta della Dogana]] of Venice.<ref name=\"plant\"/>\n\nA number of game-playing involving carnival masks, men and lions are portrayed with allusions to eighteenth-century practices and Saint Mark.<ref>{{harvnb|Guilbert|2002|p=78}}</ref> Sheila Whiteley, author of ''Women and popular music: sexuality, identity, and subjectivity'', felt that Madonna's image signified a denial of sexual knowledge, but also portrayed her in simulated writhing on a gondola, thus underpinning the simulation of deceit. The intrusion of a male lion, confirmed the underlying [[Zoophilia|bestial]] discourse of both mythological fairy tale and pornographic sex. Whiteley observed that in the video, Madonna's lover wears the lion's mask and while cavorting with him, Madonna sheds the veneer of innocence and shows her propensity for wild animal passions. Having instilled desire, metaphorically she turns her lover into a Beast.<ref>{{harvnb|Whiteley|2000|p=136}}</ref> Madonna commented about shooting with the lion:\n<blockquote>\n\"The lion didn't do anything he was supposed to do, and I ended up leaning against this pillar with his head in my crotch... I thought he was going to take a bite out of me so I lifted the veil I was wearing and had a stare-down with him and he opened his mouth and let out this huge roar. I got so frightened my heart fell in my shoe. When he finally walked away, the director yelled 'Cut' and I had to take a long breather. But I could really relate to the lion. I feel like in a past life I was a lion or a cat or something.\"<ref name=\"mick\">{{harvnb|Michael|2004|p=65}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n===Reception and analysis===\n{{Quote box|width=25%|align=left|quote=\"For 'Like a Virgin' I said 'Lets do it in Venice!'

It turned into a huge party.\"|source=\u2014Director Mary Lambert on the filming of the video.<ref>{{harvnb|Tannenbaum|Marks|2011|p=15}}</ref>\n}}\nWith the video, scholars noted the expression of Venetian vitality in it. Author Margaret Plant (2002) commented: \"With the lion of Saint Mark and the virginal city to the forefront, old sacrosanct Venice was propelled into a pop world of high-energy gyration, and endless circulation.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Plant|2002|p=413}}</ref> She also noted that Saint Mark was a symbol of a time when sexual crime was punished severely in Venice and acts of rape, homosexuality and fornication incurred the loss of a nose, a hand or sometimes life itself. Madonna appeared to challenge such brutality and stretch the boundaries of tolerance in the video. As the lion-man carried Madonna to the Venetian palace, it symbolized an instance of the Saint taking the simulated Virgin, where Madonna became a symbol for [[Republic of Venice|La Serenissima]], the Republic itself.<ref>{{harvnb|Plant|2002|p=419}}</ref>\n\nPlant also noted that Madonna, in the video, restored the energy and eroticism of Venice, which had its name taken from Venus in familiar elision. As she exchanged her blue top for a black one during the video, Madonna demonstrated her mastery and bravery of the city, which had a reputation of turning out its visitors as victims.<ref name=\"plant\"/> Carol Clerk (2002) commented that with the video, \"Madonna's days as a cheap and cheerful video star were over.

Clerk noted the song attracted an unprecedented level of attention from social groups compared to any female singer's song. \"The main problem was that most of them listened superficially to the lyric of the song, imagining that it detailed or called on an innocent's sexual initiation.\" While one section of the population were outraged at the scandal, others were taking joy at the very notion of a virginal Madonna, who retorted by saying,\n<blockquote>\nI was surprised by how people reacted to \"Like a Virgin\" because when I did that song, to me, I was singing about how something made me feel a certain way&nbsp;\u2013 brand-new and fresh&nbsp;\u2013 and everyone interpreted it as I don't want to be a virgin anymore. Fuck my brains out! That's not what I sang at all. \"Like a Virgin\" was always absolutely ambiguous.<ref name=\"rook1\"/><ref name=\"clerk\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nBiographer [[Andrew Morton (writer)|Andrew Morton]] noted that most of Madonna's admirers were females, who were born-and-brought-up with an image of old-fashioned stereotypes of women as virginal brides, or as whores, or with feminist values that rejected the use of a woman's looks for her self-advancement.<ref name=\"morton\">{{harvnb|Morton|2002|p=766}}</ref> Author William McKeen of ''Rock and roll is here to stay: an anthology'' commented that with the song, Madonna became the last word in attitude and fashion for young girls of that time. He compared that image of Madonna with that of [[Barbie]]. McKeen explained that Madonna intermixed middle-class ideas of femininity with examples of what femininity meant to her, which was having equal opportunity. She offered an aggressive sexuality that implied it was acceptable for women not only to initiate relationships, but also enjoy them.<ref>{{harvnb|McKeen|2000|p=232}}</ref> In addition, according to Morton, at a time when eighties fashions were promoting flat-chested, stick-thin women as ideals of beauty, the more curvaceous Madonna made average girls feel that it was fine to be in the shape they were. A new word called '[[Madonna wannabe]]' was introduced to describe the thousands of girls who tried to emulate Madonna's style. University professors, gender-studies experts and feminists earnestly started discussing her role as a post-modernist style and cultural icon. According to author Debbi Voller, \"Like a Virgin\" gave rise to the icon Madonna.<ref name=\"morton\"/>\n\nThe performance of \"Like a Virgin\" at the first MTV Video Music Awards is considered by MTV as \"one of the most iconic pop performances of all time\". Christina Garibaldi from the channel noted that the performance \"helped make the Video Music Awards a household name... and simultaneously set the bar for every other performer to come after her. From that point forward, every artist, when they hit the VMA stage, wanted to have a performance you would forever be talking about.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1978552/madonna-video-music-awards-like-a-virgin/|title=Here's The Wardrobe Malfunction That Made Madonna's 'Like A Virgin' VMA Performance Legendary |first=Christina|last=Garibaldi|date=October 28, 2014|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=September 4, 2017}}</ref> ''Billboard'' ranked it at number two of \"The 100 Greatest Award Show Performances of All Time\", explaining that \"Before Madonna, the best award-show performances could hope for was to get people to buy the record, after her, they became the historical record; the way we remember stars at their most iconic, and the way they demonstrate their immortality, no matter whose names are on the night's envelopes.

He and his brother John worked twelve-hour days as [[Spinning mule#Duties of the operatives|piecers]], tying broken cotton threads on the spinning machines.\n\nNeil Livingstone was a [[Sunday school]] teacher and [[teetotaller]] who handed out Christian tracts on his travels as a door-to-door tea salesman. He extensively read books on theology, travel, and missionary enterprises. This rubbed off on the young David, who became an avid reader, but he also loved scouring the countryside for animal, plant, and geological specimens in local limestone quarries. Neil feared that science books were undermining Christianity and attempted to force his son to read nothing but theology, but David's deep interest in nature and science led him to investigate the relationship between [[Relationship between religion and science|religion and science]].<ref name=\"Ross2006\">{{cite book|last=Ross|first=Andrew C. |title=David Livingstone: Mission and Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6R9gf-lAhPUC|year=2006|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=978-1-85285-565-9}}</ref>{{rp|6}} In 1832, he read ''Philosophy of a Future State'', written by [[Thomas Dick (scientist)|Thomas Dick]], and he found the rationale that he needed to reconcile faith and science and, apart from the Bible, this book was perhaps his greatest philosophical influence.<ref name=\"Blaikie1880\">{{cite book|last=Blaikie|first=William Garden|author-link=William Garden Blaikie |title=The Personal Life of David Livingstone...

Influenced by [[revivalism|revivalistic]] teachings in the United States, Livingstone entirely accepted the proposition put by Charles Finney, Professor of Theology at Oberlin College, Ohio, that \"the Holy Spirit is open to all who ask it\". For Livingstone, this meant a release from the fear of eternal damnation.<ref name=\"Jeal2013\" /> {{rp|13}} Livingstone's reading of missionary [[Karl G\u00fctzlaff]]'s ''Appeal to the Churches of Britain and America on behalf of China'' enabled him to persuade his father that medical study could advance religious ends.<ref name=\"Vetch1893\">{{cite DNB|wstitle=Livingstone, David|first=Robert Hamilton |last=Vetch|p=385|volume=33}}</ref>\n\nLivingstone's experiences in H. Monteith's Blantyre cotton mill were also important from ages 10 to 26, first as a piecer and later as a [[Spinning mule#Duties of the operatives|spinner]]. This monotonous work was necessary to support his impoverished family, but it taught him persistence, endurance, and a natural empathy with all who labour, as expressed by lines that he used to hum from the egalitarian [[A Man's A Man for A' That|Rabbie Burns song]]: \"When man to man, the world o'er/Shall brothers be for a' that\".{{efn|This sentiment today would be expressed along the lines of: \"all people, worldwide, are brothers and sisters, despite everything.\"<ref name=\"Blaikie1880\" />}}\n\n==Education==\nLivingstone attended Blantyre village school, along with the few other mill children with the endurance to do so despite their 14-hour workday (6 am\u20138 pm). Having a family with a strong, ongoing commitment to study reinforced his education. After reading the appeal by Gutzlaff for medical missionaries for China in 1834, he began saving money to enter Anderson's College, Glasgow in 1836 (now [[University of Strathclyde]]), as well as attending [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] and theology lectures at the [[University of Glasgow]].<ref name=\"UnivGlas\">{{cite web | title = The University of Glasgow Story : David Livingstone | author =  | work = University of Glasgow | date = n.d. | accessdate = 2018-07-12 | url = https://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH0220&type=P | language =   | quote =  }}</ref> \n\nTo enter medical school, he required some knowledge of Latin. He was tutored by a local Roman Catholic man, Daniel Gallagher. Later in life, Gallagher became a priest and founded the third oldest Catholic Church in Glasgow: St Simon's, Partick.

In addition to his other studies, he attended divinity lectures by Wardlaw, a leader at this time of vigorous anti-slavery campaigning in the city. \n\nShortly after, he applied to join the [[London Missionary Society]] (LMS) and was accepted subject to missionary training. He was a student at the [[Charing Cross Hospital Medical School]] in 1838\u201340, with his courses covering medical practice, midwifery, and botany. During this period he also spent time on missionary training in London and in [[Ongar, Essex]], to become a minister within the Congregational Union serving under the LMS. While training under the LMS, he and other students were taught Greek, Latin, Hebrew and theology by the Reverend Richard Cecil.<ref name=\"Jeal2013\" /> Despite his impressive personality, he was a plain preacher, described by Cecil as \"worthy but remote from brilliant\"<ref name=\"Jeal2013\" /> and would have been rejected by the LMS had the director not given him a second chance to pass the course.<ref name=\"Blaikie1880\" /> He qualified as a Licentiate of the [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow|Faculty (now Royal College) of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow]] on 16 November 1840, and was later made an Honorary Fellow of the Faculty, on 5 January 1857.<ref name=\"Duncan1896\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/memorialsoffacul00duncuoft|title=Memorials of the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow, 1599\u20131850|last=Duncan|first=Alexander|publisher=MacLehose|year=1896|isbn=|location=Glasgow|pages=[https://archive.org/details/memorialsoffacul00duncuoft/page/100 100], 293|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Vision for Africa==\n[[File:Dance of Landeens.jpg|thumb|[[Zulu people|Zulu]] dance, from Livingstone's ''Narrative of an Expedition to the Zambesi and its Tributaries'']]\nLivingstone hoped to go to China as a missionary, but the [[First Opium War]] broke out in September 1839 and the LMS suggested the [[West Indies]] instead. In 1840, while continuing his medical studies in London, Livingstone met LMS missionary [[Robert Moffat (missionary)|Robert Moffat]], on leave from [[Kuruman]], a missionary outpost in South Africa, north of the [[Orange River]]. He was excited by Moffat's vision of expanding missionary work northwards, and he was also influenced by abolitionist [[Thomas Fowell Buxton|T.F. Buxton]]'s arguments that the African slave trade might be destroyed through the influence of \"legitimate trade\" and the spread of Christianity. Livingstone, therefore, focused his ambitions on Southern Africa.<ref name=\"Vetch1893\" />\n\nLivingstone was deeply influenced by Moffat's judgement that he was the right person to go to the vast plains to the north of [[Bechuanaland]], where he had glimpsed \"the smoke of a thousand villages, where no missionary had ever been\".<ref name=\"Blaikie1880\" /> During this time, he visited [[Mabotsa, Botswana]] (near [[Zeerust]], North West Province, South Africa<ref name=\"Thema\">{{cite journal |last1=Thema |first1=B.C. |title=The Church and Education in Botswana During the 19th Century |journal=Botswana Notes and Records |date=1968 |volume=1 |pages=1\u20134 |publisher=[[Botswana Society]] |jstor=40979214 }}</ref>) an area where there were many [[lions]] terrorizing the villagers. They stated, \"The lion, the lord of the night, kills our cattle and sheep even in the daytime\". Livingstone felt that, if he could kill just one lion, the others would take it as a warning and leave the villages and their livestock alone. Therefore, he led the villagers on a lion hunt. Seeing a large lion, he fired his gun, but the animal was not sufficiently injured to prevent it from attacking him while re-loading, seriously wounding his left arm. The broken bone, even though inexpertly set by himself and a missionary's daughter, bonded strongly, enabling him to shoot and lift heavy weights, though it remained a source of much suffering for the rest of his life, and he was not able to lift the arm higher than his shoulder.<ref name=\"Harrison1954\">{{cite book|last=Harrison|first=Eugene Myers |title=Giants of the Missionary Trail: The Life Stories of Eight Men who Defied Death and Demons | chapter-url=https://www.wholesomewords.org/missions/giants/biolivingstone.html| year=1954|publisher=Scripture Press|chapter=David Livingstone: The Pathfinder of Africa}}</ref><ref name=\"Jeal2013\" />{{rp|59}}\n\n==Exploration of southern and central Africa==\n[[File:Map livingstone travels africa.jpg|thumb|The journeys of Livingstone in Africa between 1851 and 1873]]\n\nLivingstone was obliged to leave his first mission at Mabotsa in Botswana in 1845 after irreconcilable differences emerged between him and his fellow missionary, Rogers Edwards, and because the Bakgatla were proving indifferent to the Gospel.

Just as important had been the three journeys far to the north of Kolobeng which he had undertaken between 1849 and 1851 and which had left him convinced that the best long-term chance for successful evangelising was to explore Africa in advance of European commercial interest and other missionaries by mapping and navigating its rivers which might then become \"Highways\" into the interior.<ref name=\"Jeal2013\" /> {{rp|82, 93, 103\u2013105, 108}}\n\nLivingstone departed from the village of Linyanti, located roughly in the center of the continent on the Zambezi river. Livingstone had reached this point coming from the south, in Capetown, it was the northern frontier missionary post. Livingstone set out from Linyanti to the north-west, up the Zambezi, believing this would map the best \"highway\" into Africa. He had the help of 27 African guides and warriors loaned by Sekeletu, chief of the Kololo in Linyanti. They reached the Portuguese city of Loanda ([[Luanda]]) on the Atlantic after profound difficulties and the near-death of Livingstone from fever. Livingstone realized the route would be too difficult for future traders, so he retraced the journey back to Linyanti. Then with 114 men, loaned by the same chief, he set off east down the Zambezi. On this leg he became the first European to see the Mosi-o-Tunya (\"the smoke that thunders\") waterfall, which he named [[Victoria Falls, Zambia|Victoria Falls]] after [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]].

From Livingstone's ''Narrative'']]\n\nLivingstone believed that he had a spiritual calling for exploration to find routes for commercial trade which would displace slave trade routes, rather than for preaching. He was encouraged by the response in Britain to his discoveries and support for future expeditions, so he resigned from the London Missionary Society in 1857. According to his Victorian biographer W. Garden Blaikie, the reason was to prevent public concerns that his non-missionary activities such as his scientific work might show the LMS to be \"departing from the proper objects of a missionary body\". Livingstone had written to the directors of the society to express complaints about their policies and the clustering of too many missionaries near the Cape Colony, despite the sparse native population.<ref name=\"Blaikie1880\" /> Blaikie, not wishing to offend Livingstone's relatives, still living in 1880 when his book was published, concealed the real reason why Livingstone left the LMS and the manner of it. In a letter from the directors of the LMS, which Livingstone received at Quelimane, he was congratulated on his journey but was told that the directors were \"restricted in their power of aiding plans connected only remotely with the spread of the Gospel\".<ref name=\"Jeal2013\" /> {{rp|156}} \n\nThis brusque rejection of his plan for new mission stations north of the Zambesi and his wider object of opening the interior via the Zambezi, was not enough to make him resign at once. When he was approached by Roderick Murchison, president of the [[Royal Geographical Society]], who put him in touch with the Foreign Secretary, Livingstone said nothing to the LMS directors, even when his leadership of a government expedition to the Zambezi seemed increasingly likely to be funded by the Exchequer. \"I am not yet fairly on with the Government,\" he told a friend, \"but am nearly quite off with the Society (LMS).\" And while he negotiated with the government, he deceived the LMS into thinking that he would return to Africa with their mission to the Kololo in Barotseland, which Livingstone had used his national fame to coerce them into initiating against their better judgement.<ref name=\"Jeal2013\" /> {{rp|169\u2013171, 189}} \n\nThe end result would be the death of a missionary and his wife, the death of a second missionary's wife and the deaths of three children from malaria. Livingstone had suffered over thirty attacks during his journey but had deliberately understated his suffering so as not to discourage the LMS from sending missionaries to the Kololo. Consequently, the missionaries had set out for a marshy region with wholly inadequate supplies of quinine and they had soon weakened and died.<ref name=\"Jeal2013\" /> {{rp|159, 176\u2013185}}\n\nIn May 1857 Livingstone was appointed as Her Majesty's Consul with a roving commission, extending through Mozambique to the areas west of it.<ref>Livingstone to Lord Clarendon 19 March 1857 Clarendon Papers Bodleian Library Dep. c 80</ref>\n\n===Zambezi expedition===<!-- This section is linked from [[Zambezi]] -->\nThe British government agreed to fund Livingstone's idea and he returned to Africa as head of the [[Second Zambesi Expedition]] to examine the natural resources of southeastern Africa and open up the Zambezi River. However, it turned out to be completely impassable to boats past the [[Cahora Bassa]] rapids, a series of [[Waterfall#Types of waterfalls|cataracts]] and [[rapids]] that Livingstone had failed to explore on his earlier travels.<ref name=\"Holmes1996\" />\n[[File:MaryMoffatGravestone.JPG|thumb|Burial site of Mary Moffat Livingstone in Chupanga, Mozambique]]\nThe expedition lasted from March 1858 until the middle of 1864. Expedition members recorded that Livingstone was an inept leader incapable of managing a large-scale project. He was also said to be secretive, self-righteous, and moody, and could not tolerate criticism, all of which severely strained the expedition and which led to his physician [[John Kirk (explorer)|John Kirk]] writing in 1862, \"I can come to no other conclusion than that Dr Livingstone is out of his mind and a most unsafe leader\".<ref name=\"Wright2008\">{{cite book|last=Wright|first=Ed |title=Lost Explorers: Adventurers who Disappeared Off the Face of the Earth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=El1Kplv8Ix8C|year=2008|publisher=Allen & Unwin|isbn=978-1-74196-139-3}}</ref>\n\nArtist [[Thomas Baines]] was dismissed from the expedition on charges of theft (which he vigorously denied). The expedition became the first to reach [[Lake Malawi]] and they explored it in a four-oared [[Captain's gig|gig]]. In 1862, they returned to the coast to await the arrival of a [[steam boat]] specially designed to sail on Lake Malawi. Mary Livingstone arrived along with the boat. She died on 27 April 1862 from [[malaria]] and Livingstone continued his explorations. Attempts to navigate the [[Ruvuma River]] failed because of the continual fouling of the paddle wheels from the bodies thrown in the river by slave traders, and Livingstone's assistants gradually died or left him.<ref name=\"Wright2008\" />\n\nIt was at this point that he uttered his most famous quotation, ''\"I am prepared to go anywhere, provided it be forward.\"'' He eventually returned home in 1864 after the government ordered the recall of the expedition because of its increasing costs and failure to find a navigable route to the interior. The Zambezi Expedition was castigated as a failure in many newspapers of the time, and Livingstone experienced great difficulty in raising funds to further explore Africa. Nevertheless, John Kirk, Charles Meller, and Richard Thornton, the scientists appointed to work under Livingstone, did contribute large collections of botanical, ecological, geological, and ethnographic material to scientific Institutions in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"Wright2008\" />\n\n===Nile River===\nIn January 1866, Livingstone returned to Africa, this time to [[Zanzibar]], and from there he set out to seek the source of the [[Nile]]. [[Richard Francis Burton]], [[John Hanning Speke]], and [[Samuel Baker]] had identified either [[Lake Albert (Africa)|Lake Albert]] or [[Lake Victoria]] as the source (which was partially correct, as the Nile \"bubbles from the ground high in the mountains of [[Burundi]] halfway between [[Lake Tanganyika]] and [[Lake Victoria]]\"<ref name=\"Dugard2012\">{{cite book|last=Dugard|first=Martin |title=Into Africa: The Epic Adventures Of Stanley And Livingstone|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X5xM29LaRZQC&pg=PA384|year=2012|publisher=Transworld|isbn=978-1-4464-3720-9}}</ref>{{rp|384}}), but there was still serious debate on the matter. Livingstone believed that the source was farther south and assembled a team to find it consisting of freed slaves, [[Comoros]] Islanders, twelve [[Sepoy]]s, and two servants from his previous expedition, [[Chuma and Susi]]. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n[[File:Livingstone House, Mikindani, Tanzania.JPG|thumb|This house in Mikindani in southern Tanzania was the starting point for Livingstone's last expedition. He stayed here from 24 March to 7 April 1866.]]\nLivingstone set out from the mouth of the Ruvuma river, but his assistants gradually began deserting him. The Comoros Islanders had returned to Zanzibar and (falsely) informed authorities that Livingstone had died. He reached Lake Malawi on 6 August, by which time most of his supplies had been stolen, including all his medicines. Livingstone then travelled through swamps in the direction of Lake Tanganyika, with his health declining. He sent a message to Zanzibar requesting that supplies be sent to [[Ujiji]] and he then headed west, forced by ill health to travel with slave traders. He arrived at [[Lake Mweru]] on 8 November 1867 and continued on, travelling south to become the first European to see [[Lake Bangweulu]]. Upon finding the [[Lualaba River]], Livingstone theorised that it could have been the high part of the [[Nile River]]; but realised that it in fact flowed into the [[River Congo]] at [[River Congo|Upper Congo Lake]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Livingstone |first1=David |title=Personal Letter to J.

He filled in details of [[Lake Tanganyika]], [[Lake Mweru]], and the course of many rivers, especially the upper Zambezi, and his observations enabled large regions to be mapped which previously had been blank. Even so, the farthest north he reached was the north end of Lake Tanganyika \u2013 still south of the [[Equator]] \u2013 and he did not penetrate the rainforest of the [[River Congo]] any farther downstream than Ntangwe near [[Misisi]].<ref>[http://www.scran.ac.uk/000-000-099-943-C \"Map of Livingstone's travels\"], ''National Museums of Scotland''.

However, the phrase appears in a ''New York Herald'' editorial dated 10 August 1872, and the ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' and the ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' both quote it without questioning its veracity. The words are famous because of their perceived humour, Livingstone being the only other white person for hundreds of miles. Stanley's book suggests that it was really because of embarrassment because he did not dare to embrace him.\n\nDespite Stanley's urgings, Livingstone was determined not to leave Africa until his mission was complete. His illness made him confused and he had judgment difficulties at the end of his life. He explored the Lualaba and, failing to find connections to the Nile, returned to [[Lake Bangweulu]] and its swamps to explore possible rivers flowing out northwards.<ref name=\"LivingstoneWaller1874\" />\n\n==Christianity and Sechele==\nLivingstone is known as \"Africa's greatest missionary,\" yet he is recorded as having converted only one African: [[Sechele I|Sechele]], who was the chief of the [[Koena tribe|Kwena people]] of [[Botswana]] (Kwena are one of the main Sotho-Tswana clans, found in South Africa, Lesotho, and Botswana<ref name=\"Tomkins2013a\">{{cite web | title = The African chief converted to Christianity by Dr Livingstone | last = Tomkins | first = Stephen | work = BBC News | date = 19 March 2013 | accessdate = 2018-07-12 | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-21807368 | quote =  }}</ref> in all three Sotho-Tswana language groupings). Sechele was born in 1812. His father died when Sechele was 10, and two of his uncles divided the tribe, which forced Sechele to leave his home for nine years. When Sechele returned, he took over one of his uncle's tribes; at that point, he met David Livingstone.<ref name=\"Ross2006\" /> {{Pages needed |date=November 2014}}\nLivingstone was known through a large part of Africa for treating the natives with respect, and the tribes that he visited returned his respect with faith and loyalty. He could never permanently convert the tribesmen to Christianity, however. Among other reasons, Sechele, by then the leader of the African tribe, did not like the way that Livingstone could not demand rain of his God like his rainmakers, who said that they could. After long hesitation from Livingstone, he baptised Sechele and had the church completely embrace him. Sechele was now a part of the church, but he continued to act according to his African culture, which went against Livingstone's teachings.<ref name=\"Horne1999\">{{cite book|last=Horne|first=C.

He had five wives, and when Livingstone told him to get rid of four of them, it shook the foundations of the Kwena tribe. After he finally divorced the women, Livingstone baptised them all and everything went well. However, one year later one of his ex-wives became pregnant and Sechele was the father. Sechele begged Livingstone not to give up on him because his faith was still strong, but Livingstone left the country and went north to continue his Christianizing attempts.<ref name=\"Tomkins2013\" /> {{Pages needed |date=November 2014}}\n\nLivingstone immediately became interested in Sechele, and especially his ability to read.

In the estimation of Neil Parsons of the University of Botswana, Sechele \"did more to propagate Christianity in 19th-century southern Africa than virtually any single European missionary\".

He was a poor leader of his peers, and he ended up on his last expedition as an individualist explorer with servants and porters but no expert support around him. At the same time, he did not use the brutal methods of maverick explorers such as [[Henry Morton Stanley|Stanley]] to keep his retinue of porters in line and his supplies secure. For these reasons, he accepted help and hospitality from 1867 onwards from Mohamad Bogharib and Mohamad bin Saleh (also known as \"Mpamari\"), traders who kept and traded in [[slavery|slaves]], as he recounts in his journals. They, in turn, benefited from Livingstone's influence with local people, which facilitated Mpamari's release from bondage to [[Kazembe|Mwata Kazembe]]. Livingstone was furious to discover that some of the replacement porters sent at his request from Ujiji were slaves.<ref name=\"LivingstoneWaller1874\" />\n\nLivingstone's figures on slaves have however been criticised as highly exaggerated.<ref name=\"TeelockPeerthum2017\">{{cite book|last1=Teelock|first1=Vijayalakshmi|last2=Peerthum|first2=Satyendra|title=Transition from Slavery in Zanzibar and Mauritius|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0iXUDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA47|year=2017|publisher=CODESRIA|isbn=978-2-86978-680-6|pages=47\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Rijpma2015\">{{cite book|last=Rijpma|first=Sjoerd |title=David Livingstone and the Myth of African Poverty and Disease: A Close Examination of his Writing on the Pre-colonial Era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Jj8CQAAQBAJ&pg=PA161|year=2015|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-29373-1|pages=161\u2013}}</ref>\n{{clear left}}\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Livingstone statue2.jpg|thumb|A new statue of David Livingstone on the Zambian side of [[Victoria Falls]]]]\nBy the late 1860s Livingstone's reputation in Europe had suffered owing to the failure of the missions he set up, and of the Zambezi Expedition; and his ideas about the source of the Nile were not supported. His expeditions were hardly models of order and organisation. His reputation was rehabilitated by Stanley and his newspaper,<ref name=\"Holmes1996\" /> and by the loyalty of Livingstone's servants whose long journey with his body inspired wonder. The publication of his last journal revealed stubborn determination in the face of suffering.<ref name=\"Blaikie1880\" />\n\nIn 1860, the [[Universities' Mission to Central Africa]] was founded at his request. Many important missionaries, such as [[Leader Stirling]] and [[Miss Annie Allen]], would later work for this group.

He inspired abolitionists of the slave trade, explorers, and missionaries. He opened up Central Africa to missionaries who initiated the education and healthcare for Africans, and trade by the [[African Lakes Company]]. He was held in some esteem by many African chiefs and local people and his name facilitated relations between them and the British.<ref name=\"Blaikie1880\" />\n\n[[File:David Livingstone statue, Princes Street Gardens, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|Livingstone statue, Edinburgh by [[Amelia Robertson Hill]]]]\nPartly as a result, within 50 years of his death, colonial rule was established in Africa, and white settlement was encouraged to extend further into the interior. However, what Livingstone envisaged for \"colonies\" was not what we now know as colonial rule, but rather settlements of dedicated Christian Europeans who would live among the people to help them work out ways of living that did not involve slavery.<ref name=\"Tomkins2013\" /> Livingstone was part of an evangelical and nonconformist movement in Britain which during the 19th century helped change the national mindset from the notion of a divine right to rule 'lesser races', to more modernly ethical ideas in foreign policy.<ref name=\"Barnett1986\">{{cite book|last=Barnett|first=Correlli |title=The Audit of War: The Illusion and Reality of Britain as a Great Nation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=39a0AAAAIAAJ|year=1986|publisher=MacMillan|isbn=978-0-333-35376-9}}</ref>\n\n[[David Livingstone Centre|The David Livingstone Centre]] in Blantyre celebrates his life and is based in the house in which he was born, on the site of the mill in which he started his working life.

Nonetheless, at a time when countries are being renamed and statues are being toppled, Livingstone has not fallen. Despite modern Africans' animosity toward other Europeans, such as Cecil Rhodes, Livingstone endures as a heroic legend.

He and his brother John worked twelve-hour days as [[Spinning mule#Duties of the operatives|piecers]], tying broken cotton threads on the spinning machines.\n\nNeil Livingstone was a [[Sunday school]] teacher and [[teetotaller]] who handed out Christian tracts on his travels as a door-to-door tea salesman. He extensively read books on theology, travel, and missionary enterprises. This rubbed off on the young David, who became an avid reader, but he also loved scouring the countryside for animal, plant, and geological specimens in local limestone quarries. Neil feared that science books were undermining Christianity and attempted to force his son to read nothing but theology, but David's deep interest in nature and science led him to investigate the relationship between [[Relationship between religion and science|religion and science]].<ref name=\"Ross2006\">{{cite book|last=Ross|first=Andrew C. |title=David Livingstone: Mission and Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6R9gf-lAhPUC|year=2006|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=978-1-85285-565-9}}</ref>{{rp|6}} In 1832, he read ''Philosophy of a Future State'', written by [[Thomas Dick (scientist)|Thomas Dick]], and he found the rationale that he needed to reconcile faith and science and, apart from the Bible, this book was perhaps his greatest philosophical influence.<ref name=\"Blaikie1880\">{{cite book|last=Blaikie|first=William Garden|author-link=William Garden Blaikie |title=The Personal Life of David Livingstone...

Influenced by [[revivalism|revivalistic]] teachings in the United States, Livingstone entirely accepted the proposition put by Charles Finney, Professor of Theology at Oberlin College, Ohio, that \"the Holy Spirit is open to all who ask it\".

Monteith's Blantyre cotton mill were also important from ages 10 to 26, first as a piecer and later as a [[Spinning mule#Duties of the operatives|spinner]]. This monotonous work was necessary to support his impoverished family, but it taught him persistence, endurance, and a natural empathy with all who labour, as expressed by lines that he used to hum from the egalitarian [[A Man's A Man for A' That|Rabbie Burns song]]: \"When man to man, the world o'er/Shall brothers be for a' that\".{{efn|This sentiment today would be expressed along the lines of: \"all people, worldwide, are brothers and sisters, despite everything.\"<ref name=\"Blaikie1880\" />}}\n\n==Education==\nLivingstone attended Blantyre village school, along with the few other mill children with the endurance to do so despite their 14-hour workday (6 am\u20138 pm). Having a family with a strong, ongoing commitment to study reinforced his education. After reading the appeal by Gutzlaff for medical missionaries for China in 1834, he began saving money to enter Anderson's College, Glasgow in 1836 (now [[University of Strathclyde]]), as well as attending [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] and theology lectures at the [[University of Glasgow]].<ref name=\"UnivGlas\">{{cite web | title = The University of Glasgow Story : David Livingstone | author =  | work = University of Glasgow | date = n.d. | accessdate = 2018-07-12 | url = https://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH0220&type=P | language =   | quote =  }}</ref> \n\nTo enter medical school, he required some knowledge of Latin. He was tutored by a local Roman Catholic man, Daniel Gallagher. Later in life, Gallagher became a priest and founded the third oldest Catholic Church in Glasgow: St Simon's, Partick.

In addition to his other studies, he attended divinity lectures by Wardlaw, a leader at this time of vigorous anti-slavery campaigning in the city. \n\nShortly after, he applied to join the [[London Missionary Society]] (LMS) and was accepted subject to missionary training. He was a student at the [[Charing Cross Hospital Medical School]] in 1838\u201340, with his courses covering medical practice, midwifery, and botany. During this period he also spent time on missionary training in London and in [[Ongar, Essex]], to become a minister within the Congregational Union serving under the LMS. While training under the LMS, he and other students were taught Greek, Latin, Hebrew and theology by the Reverend Richard Cecil.<ref name=\"Jeal2013\" /> Despite his impressive personality, he was a plain preacher, described by Cecil as \"worthy but remote from brilliant\"<ref name=\"Jeal2013\" /> and would have been rejected by the LMS had the director not given him a second chance to pass the course.<ref name=\"Blaikie1880\" /> He qualified as a Licentiate of the [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow|Faculty (now Royal College) of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow]] on 16 November 1840, and was later made an Honorary Fellow of the Faculty, on 5 January 1857.<ref name=\"Duncan1896\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/memorialsoffacul00duncuoft|title=Memorials of the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow, 1599\u20131850|last=Duncan|first=Alexander|publisher=MacLehose|year=1896|isbn=|location=Glasgow|pages=[https://archive.org/details/memorialsoffacul00duncuoft/page/100 100], 293|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Vision for Africa==\n[[File:Dance of Landeens.jpg|thumb|[[Zulu people|Zulu]] dance, from Livingstone's ''Narrative of an Expedition to the Zambesi and its Tributaries'']]\nLivingstone hoped to go to China as a missionary, but the [[First Opium War]] broke out in September 1839 and the LMS suggested the [[West Indies]] instead. In 1840, while continuing his medical studies in London, Livingstone met LMS missionary [[Robert Moffat (missionary)|Robert Moffat]], on leave from [[Kuruman]], a missionary outpost in South Africa, north of the [[Orange River]]. He was excited by Moffat's vision of expanding missionary work northwards, and he was also influenced by abolitionist [[Thomas Fowell Buxton|T.F. Buxton]]'s arguments that the African slave trade might be destroyed through the influence of \"legitimate trade\" and the spread of Christianity. Livingstone, therefore, focused his ambitions on Southern Africa.<ref name=\"Vetch1893\" />\n\nLivingstone was deeply influenced by Moffat's judgement that he was the right person to go to the vast plains to the north of [[Bechuanaland]], where he had glimpsed \"the smoke of a thousand villages, where no missionary had ever been\".<ref name=\"Blaikie1880\" /> During this time, he visited [[Mabotsa, Botswana]] (near [[Zeerust]], North West Province, South Africa<ref name=\"Thema\">{{cite journal |last1=Thema |first1=B.C. |title=The Church and Education in Botswana During the 19th Century |journal=Botswana Notes and Records |date=1968 |volume=1 |pages=1\u20134 |publisher=[[Botswana Society]] |jstor=40979214 }}</ref>) an area where there were many [[lions]] terrorizing the villagers. They stated, \"The lion, the lord of the night, kills our cattle and sheep even in the daytime\". Livingstone felt that, if he could kill just one lion, the others would take it as a warning and leave the villages and their livestock alone. Therefore, he led the villagers on a lion hunt. Seeing a large lion, he fired his gun, but the animal was not sufficiently injured to prevent it from attacking him while re-loading, seriously wounding his left arm. The broken bone, even though inexpertly set by himself and a missionary's daughter, bonded strongly, enabling him to shoot and lift heavy weights, though it remained a source of much suffering for the rest of his life, and he was not able to lift the arm higher than his shoulder.<ref name=\"Harrison1954\">{{cite book|last=Harrison|first=Eugene Myers |title=Giants of the Missionary Trail: The Life Stories of Eight Men who Defied Death and Demons | chapter-url=https://www.wholesomewords.org/missions/giants/biolivingstone.html| year=1954|publisher=Scripture Press|chapter=David Livingstone: The Pathfinder of Africa}}</ref><ref name=\"Jeal2013\" />{{rp|59}}\n\n==Exploration of southern and central Africa==\n[[File:Map livingstone travels africa.jpg|thumb|The journeys of Livingstone in Africa between 1851 and 1873]]\n\nLivingstone was obliged to leave his first mission at Mabotsa in Botswana in 1845 after irreconcilable differences emerged between him and his fellow missionary, Rogers Edwards, and because the Bakgatla were proving indifferent to the Gospel.

Just as important had been the three journeys far to the north of Kolobeng which he had undertaken between 1849 and 1851 and which had left him convinced that the best long-term chance for successful evangelising was to explore Africa in advance of European commercial interest and other missionaries by mapping and navigating its rivers which might then become \"Highways\" into the interior.<ref name=\"Jeal2013\" /> {{rp|82, 93, 103\u2013105, 108}}\n\nLivingstone departed from the village of Linyanti, located roughly in the center of the continent on the Zambezi river. Livingstone had reached this point coming from the south, in Capetown, it was the northern frontier missionary post. Livingstone set out from Linyanti to the north-west, up the Zambezi, believing this would map the best \"highway\" into Africa. He had the help of 27 African guides and warriors loaned by Sekeletu, chief of the Kololo in Linyanti. They reached the Portuguese city of Loanda ([[Luanda]]) on the Atlantic after profound difficulties and the near-death of Livingstone from fever. Livingstone realized the route would be too difficult for future traders, so he retraced the journey back to Linyanti. Then with 114 men, loaned by the same chief, he set off east down the Zambezi. On this leg he became the first European to see the Mosi-o-Tunya (\"the smoke that thunders\") waterfall, which he named [[Victoria Falls, Zambia|Victoria Falls]] after [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]. Eventually he successfully reached [[Quelimane]] on the Indian Ocean, having mapped most of the course of the Zambezi river.<ref name=\"Jeal2013\" /> {{rp|126, 147\u20138}}\n\nIn this way Livingstone became the first European to cross south-central Africa which had never been crossed by Europeans at that [[latitude]] before. Livingstone's accomplishment made him famous.<ref name=\"Jeal2013\" /> {{rp|126, 147\u20138}} But it was not without precedent; a few years earlier, in 1853&ndash;1854, two Arab traders crossed the continent from [[Zanzibar]] to [[Benguela]]; and in the first decade of the 1800s, two native traders crossed from Angola to Mozambique; and Portuguese traders had already penetrated to the middle of the continent from both sides.{{sfn|Jeal|1973b|p=159}} These non-European accomplishments were little known or cared about in Europe and so Livingstone was hailed the explorer who \"opened up\" Africa.{{sfn|Jeal|1973b|p=159}}\n\n[[File:Preaching from a Waggon (David Livingstone) by The London Missionary Society.jpg|thumb|Livingstone preaching the gospel to unconverted Africans.

His motto\u2014now inscribed on his statue at Victoria Falls\u2014was \"{{visible anchor|Christianity, Commerce and Civilization}}\", a combination that he hoped would form an alternative to the slave trade, and impart dignity to the Africans in the eyes of Europeans.<ref name=\"Tomkins2013\">{{cite book|last=Tomkins|first=Stephen |title=David Livingstone: The Unexplored Story|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wZv7G67rWuwC|year=2013|publisher=Lion Books|isbn=978-0-7459-5568-1}}</ref> He believed that the key to achieving these goals was the navigation of the [[Zambezi River]] as a Christian commercial highway into the interior.<ref name=\"Holmes1996\">{{cite book|last=Holmes|first=Tim |title=Spectrum Guide to Zambia|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xlUwAQAAIAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Struik|isbn=978-1-86872-012-5|chapter=The History}}</ref> He returned to Britain to garner support for his ideas, and to publish a book on his travels which brought him fame as one of the leading explorers of the age.\n\n[[File:Gang of Captives at Mbame\u2019s.jpg|thumb|Slave traders and their captives bound in chains and collared with 'taming sticks'. From Livingstone's ''Narrative'']]\n\nLivingstone believed that he had a spiritual calling for exploration to find routes for commercial trade which would displace slave trade routes, rather than for preaching. He was encouraged by the response in Britain to his discoveries and support for future expeditions, so he resigned from the London Missionary Society in 1857. According to his Victorian biographer W. Garden Blaikie, the reason was to prevent public concerns that his non-missionary activities such as his scientific work might show the LMS to be \"departing from the proper objects of a missionary body\". Livingstone had written to the directors of the society to express complaints about their policies and the clustering of too many missionaries near the Cape Colony, despite the sparse native population.<ref name=\"Blaikie1880\" /> Blaikie, not wishing to offend Livingstone's relatives, still living in 1880 when his book was published, concealed the real reason why Livingstone left the LMS and the manner of it. In a letter from the directors of the LMS, which Livingstone received at Quelimane, he was congratulated on his journey but was told that the directors were \"restricted in their power of aiding plans connected only remotely with the spread of the Gospel\".<ref name=\"Jeal2013\" /> {{rp|156}} \n\nThis brusque rejection of his plan for new mission stations north of the Zambesi and his wider object of opening the interior via the Zambezi, was not enough to make him resign at once. When he was approached by Roderick Murchison, president of the [[Royal Geographical Society]], who put him in touch with the Foreign Secretary, Livingstone said nothing to the LMS directors, even when his leadership of a government expedition to the Zambezi seemed increasingly likely to be funded by the Exchequer. \"I am not yet fairly on with the Government,\" he told a friend, \"but am nearly quite off with the Society (LMS).\" And while he negotiated with the government, he deceived the LMS into thinking that he would return to Africa with their mission to the Kololo in Barotseland, which Livingstone had used his national fame to coerce them into initiating against their better judgement.<ref name=\"Jeal2013\" /> {{rp|169\u2013171, 189}} \n\nThe end result would be the death of a missionary and his wife, the death of a second missionary's wife and the deaths of three children from malaria. Livingstone had suffered over thirty attacks during his journey but had deliberately understated his suffering so as not to discourage the LMS from sending missionaries to the Kololo. Consequently, the missionaries had set out for a marshy region with wholly inadequate supplies of quinine and they had soon weakened and died.<ref name=\"Jeal2013\" /> {{rp|159, 176\u2013185}}\n\nIn May 1857 Livingstone was appointed as Her Majesty's Consul with a roving commission, extending through Mozambique to the areas west of it.<ref>Livingstone to Lord Clarendon 19 March 1857 Clarendon Papers Bodleian Library Dep. c 80</ref>\n\n===Zambezi expedition===<!-- This section is linked from [[Zambezi]] -->\nThe British government agreed to fund Livingstone's idea and he returned to Africa as head of the [[Second Zambesi Expedition]] to examine the natural resources of southeastern Africa and open up the Zambezi River. However, it turned out to be completely impassable to boats past the [[Cahora Bassa]] rapids, a series of [[Waterfall#Types of waterfalls|cataracts]] and [[rapids]] that Livingstone had failed to explore on his earlier travels.<ref name=\"Holmes1996\" />\n[[File:MaryMoffatGravestone.JPG|thumb|Burial site of Mary Moffat Livingstone in Chupanga, Mozambique]]\nThe expedition lasted from March 1858 until the middle of 1864. Expedition members recorded that Livingstone was an inept leader incapable of managing a large-scale project. He was also said to be secretive, self-righteous, and moody, and could not tolerate criticism, all of which severely strained the expedition and which led to his physician [[John Kirk (explorer)|John Kirk]] writing in 1862, \"I can come to no other conclusion than that Dr Livingstone is out of his mind and a most unsafe leader\".<ref name=\"Wright2008\">{{cite book|last=Wright|first=Ed |title=Lost Explorers: Adventurers who Disappeared Off the Face of the Earth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=El1Kplv8Ix8C|year=2008|publisher=Allen & Unwin|isbn=978-1-74196-139-3}}</ref>\n\nArtist [[Thomas Baines]] was dismissed from the expedition on charges of theft (which he vigorously denied). The expedition became the first to reach [[Lake Malawi]] and they explored it in a four-oared [[Captain's gig|gig]]. In 1862, they returned to the coast to await the arrival of a [[steam boat]] specially designed to sail on Lake Malawi. Mary Livingstone arrived along with the boat. She died on 27 April 1862 from [[malaria]] and Livingstone continued his explorations. Attempts to navigate the [[Ruvuma River]] failed because of the continual fouling of the paddle wheels from the bodies thrown in the river by slave traders, and Livingstone's assistants gradually died or left him.<ref name=\"Wright2008\" />\n\nIt was at this point that he uttered his most famous quotation, ''\"I am prepared to go anywhere, provided it be forward.\"'' He eventually returned home in 1864 after the government ordered the recall of the expedition because of its increasing costs and failure to find a navigable route to the interior. The Zambezi Expedition was castigated as a failure in many newspapers of the time, and Livingstone experienced great difficulty in raising funds to further explore Africa. Nevertheless, John Kirk, Charles Meller, and Richard Thornton, the scientists appointed to work under Livingstone, did contribute large collections of botanical, ecological, geological, and ethnographic material to scientific Institutions in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"Wright2008\" />\n\n===Nile River===\nIn January 1866, Livingstone returned to Africa, this time to [[Zanzibar]], and from there he set out to seek the source of the [[Nile]]. [[Richard Francis Burton]], [[John Hanning Speke]], and [[Samuel Baker]] had identified either [[Lake Albert (Africa)|Lake Albert]] or [[Lake Victoria]] as the source (which was partially correct, as the Nile \"bubbles from the ground high in the mountains of [[Burundi]] halfway between [[Lake Tanganyika]] and [[Lake Victoria]]\"<ref name=\"Dugard2012\">{{cite book|last=Dugard|first=Martin |title=Into Africa: The Epic Adventures Of Stanley And Livingstone|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X5xM29LaRZQC&pg=PA384|year=2012|publisher=Transworld|isbn=978-1-4464-3720-9}}</ref>{{rp|384}}), but there was still serious debate on the matter. Livingstone believed that the source was farther south and assembled a team to find it consisting of freed slaves, [[Comoros]] Islanders, twelve [[Sepoy]]s, and two servants from his previous expedition, [[Chuma and Susi]]. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n[[File:Livingstone House, Mikindani, Tanzania.JPG|thumb|This house in Mikindani in southern Tanzania was the starting point for Livingstone's last expedition. He stayed here from 24 March to 7 April 1866.]]\nLivingstone set out from the mouth of the Ruvuma river, but his assistants gradually began deserting him. The Comoros Islanders had returned to Zanzibar and (falsely) informed authorities that Livingstone had died. He reached Lake Malawi on 6 August, by which time most of his supplies had been stolen, including all his medicines. Livingstone then travelled through swamps in the direction of Lake Tanganyika, with his health declining. He sent a message to Zanzibar requesting that supplies be sent to [[Ujiji]] and he then headed west, forced by ill health to travel with slave traders. He arrived at [[Lake Mweru]] on 8 November 1867 and continued on, travelling south to become the first European to see [[Lake Bangweulu]]. Upon finding the [[Lualaba River]], Livingstone theorised that it could have been the high part of the [[Nile River]]; but realised that it in fact flowed into the [[River Congo]] at [[River Congo|Upper Congo Lake]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Livingstone |first1=David |title=Personal Letter to J.

He filled in details of [[Lake Tanganyika]], [[Lake Mweru]], and the course of many rivers, especially the upper Zambezi, and his observations enabled large regions to be mapped which previously had been blank. Even so, the farthest north he reached was the north end of Lake Tanganyika \u2013 still south of the [[Equator]] \u2013 and he did not penetrate the rainforest of the [[River Congo]] any farther downstream than Ntangwe near [[Misisi]].<ref>[http://www.scran.ac.uk/000-000-099-943-C \"Map of Livingstone's travels\"], ''National Museums of Scotland''.

However, the phrase appears in a ''New York Herald'' editorial dated 10 August 1872, and the ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' and the ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' both quote it without questioning its veracity. The words are famous because of their perceived humour, Livingstone being the only other white person for hundreds of miles. Stanley's book suggests that it was really because of embarrassment because he did not dare to embrace him.\n\nDespite Stanley's urgings, Livingstone was determined not to leave Africa until his mission was complete. His illness made him confused and he had judgment difficulties at the end of his life. He explored the Lualaba and, failing to find connections to the Nile, returned to [[Lake Bangweulu]] and its swamps to explore possible rivers flowing out northwards.<ref name=\"LivingstoneWaller1874\" />\n\n==Christianity and Sechele==\nLivingstone is known as \"Africa's greatest missionary,\" yet he is recorded as having converted only one African: [[Sechele I|Sechele]], who was the chief of the [[Koena tribe|Kwena people]] of [[Botswana]] (Kwena are one of the main Sotho-Tswana clans, found in South Africa, Lesotho, and Botswana<ref name=\"Tomkins2013a\">{{cite web | title = The African chief converted to Christianity by Dr Livingstone | last = Tomkins | first = Stephen | work = BBC News | date = 19 March 2013 | accessdate = 2018-07-12 | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-21807368 | quote =  }}</ref> in all three Sotho-Tswana language groupings). Sechele was born in 1812. His father died when Sechele was 10, and two of his uncles divided the tribe, which forced Sechele to leave his home for nine years. When Sechele returned, he took over one of his uncle's tribes; at that point, he met David Livingstone.<ref name=\"Ross2006\" /> {{Pages needed |date=November 2014}}\nLivingstone was known through a large part of Africa for treating the natives with respect, and the tribes that he visited returned his respect with faith and loyalty. He could never permanently convert the tribesmen to Christianity, however. Among other reasons, Sechele, by then the leader of the African tribe, did not like the way that Livingstone could not demand rain of his God like his rainmakers, who said that they could. After long hesitation from Livingstone, he baptised Sechele and had the church completely embrace him. Sechele was now a part of the church, but he continued to act according to his African culture, which went against Livingstone's teachings.<ref name=\"Horne1999\">{{cite book|last=Horne|first=C. Silvester |title=David Livingstone: Man of Prayer and Action|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8xwKvY6zhpcC|year=1999|publisher=Christian Liberty Press|isbn=978-1-930092-11-2}}</ref>{{rp|20}}\n\nSechele was no different from any other man of his tribe in believing in [[polygamy]]. He had five wives, and when Livingstone told him to get rid of four of them, it shook the foundations of the Kwena tribe. After he finally divorced the women, Livingstone baptised them all and everything went well. However, one year later one of his ex-wives became pregnant and Sechele was the father. Sechele begged Livingstone not to give up on him because his faith was still strong, but Livingstone left the country and went north to continue his Christianizing attempts.<ref name=\"Tomkins2013\" /> {{Pages needed |date=November 2014}}\n\nLivingstone immediately became interested in Sechele, and especially his ability to read. Being a quick learner, Sechele learned the alphabet in two days and soon called English a second language. After teaching his wives the skill, he wrote the Bible in his native tongue.<ref name=\"Livingstone1857\">{{cite book|last=Livingstone|first=David |title=Missionary Travels and Researches in South Africa: Including a Sketch of Sixteen Years' Residence in the Interior of Africa|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.33342|year=1857|publisher=Murray|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.33342/page/n34 16]}}</ref>\n\nAfter Livingstone left the Kwena tribe, Sechele remained faithful to Christianity and led missionaries to surrounding tribes as well as converting nearly his entire Kwena people. In the estimation of Neil Parsons of the University of Botswana, Sechele \"did more to propagate Christianity in 19th-century southern Africa than virtually any single European missionary\". Although Sechele was a self-proclaimed Christian, many European missionaries disagreed.

He was a poor leader of his peers, and he ended up on his last expedition as an individualist explorer with servants and porters but no expert support around him. At the same time, he did not use the brutal methods of maverick explorers such as [[Henry Morton Stanley|Stanley]] to keep his retinue of porters in line and his supplies secure. For these reasons, he accepted help and hospitality from 1867 onwards from Mohamad Bogharib and Mohamad bin Saleh (also known as \"Mpamari\"), traders who kept and traded in [[slavery|slaves]], as he recounts in his journals. They, in turn, benefited from Livingstone's influence with local people, which facilitated Mpamari's release from bondage to [[Kazembe|Mwata Kazembe]].

The single was released on 23 September 2015, by [[PMR Records]] and [[Island Records]], as the fourth single from their studio album ''[[Caracal (album)|Caracal]]'' (2015). \"Magnets\" is an atmospheric [[electropop]] song with influences of [[synth-pop|techno-pop]] along with electronic beats, clattering percussion loops, synths and tribal drums in its instrumentation. Its lyrics describe the risk taken by two lovers restricted from being together for moral reasons.\n\n\"Magnets\" was well received by [[music journalism|music critics]] with many praising its production and Lorde's vocal delivery. ''Rolling Stone'' included the song in its year-end list. An accompanying music video was directed by Ryan Hope and was released on 29 September 2015. Critics praised its dark story line and visuals.

It was written by Howard Lawrence, Guy Lawrence, Lorde and produced by [[Jimmy Napes|James Napier]] and Disclosure. The single was released on 23 September 2015, by [[PMR Records]] and [[Island Records]], as the fourth single from their studio album ''[[Caracal (album)|Caracal]]'' (2015). \"Magnets\" is an atmospheric [[electropop]] song with influences of [[synth-pop|techno-pop]] along with electronic beats, clattering percussion loops, synths and tribal drums in its instrumentation. Its lyrics describe the risk taken by two lovers restricted from being together for moral reasons.\n\n\"Magnets\" was well received by [[music journalism|music critics]] with many praising its production and Lorde's vocal delivery. ''Rolling Stone'' included the song in its year-end list. An accompanying music video was directed by Ryan Hope and was released on 29 September 2015. Critics praised its dark story line and visuals. The track became Disclosure's most successful hit in Australia and New Zealand, peaking at number 14 and number two respectively, becoming their highest-charting single on both countries. In the United States, \"Magnets\" became their first single to impact [[alternative radio]] and [[adult album alternative|adult alternative]] radio, placing at number 21 on the [[Rock Airplay]] chart and number 13 on the [[Alternative Songs]] chart.\n\n==Background and recording==\n[[File:Lorde in Seattle 2013 - 2.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Lorde smiling as she performs on-stage in white attire|Lorde co-wrote and was featured on \"Magnets\".

It was widely rumored that guitarists [[Erik Turner]] and [[Joey Allen]] had not played a note on the album and that all guitar work had been performed by ex-[[Streets (band)|Streets]] guitarist and session musician [[Mike Slamer]].<ref>[http://cityboy.org/recordings.html Info from Cityboy Recordings]</ref> While the rumor has never been verified, Slamer's wife confirmed in 1998 that her husband played guitar on the record.<ref>[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/4551/msinterview020598.html&date=2009-10-25+10:08:20 Interview with Slamer's wife]</ref> Mike Slamer has stated in interviews that he played guitar and the lead solos on the album.\nProducer Beau Hill stated in a 2012 interview that Slamer did in fact play on the album. Beau had said to the band that the \"songs are really great, but I think we\u2019re a little weak in the solo department and so I like to bring somebody in\". Beau also stated that \"everybody in the band signed off on it and everything was done above ground\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/interviews/interviews/beau_hill_your_only_constraint_is_your_own_imagination.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112033139/http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/interviews/interviews/beau_hill_your_only_constraint_is_your_own_imagination.html |archivedate=2012-01-12 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the recording of the album, [[vocalist]] [[Jani Lane]] walked in on his best friend in bed with his girlfriend, leading to his [[nervous breakdown]], and its release was delayed by several months while Lane recovered. These events would later be recounted in the single \"[[I Saw Red]]\" on the band's following album, ''[[Cherry Pie (album)|Cherry Pie]]''.<ref>[http://rockhole.bravepages.com/warrant.html Rockhole Bravepages.com]</ref>\n\nThe record was produced and engineered by [[Beau Hill]], who also contributed keyboards and backing vocals. It was recorded at The Enterprise in [[Burbank, California]].\n\n==Songs==\nThe album's themes, which include materialism (\"32 Pennies\", \"D.R.F.S.R\"), sex (\"[[Down Boys]]\", \"So Damn Pretty\", \"Cold Sweat\"), heartbreak (\"[[Heaven (Warrant song)|Heaven]]\") and loneliness (\"[[Sometimes She Cries]]\"), would be echoed on later Warrant releases.\n\nThe debut single from the band was \"Down Boys\", the song has been described as \"one of the toughest, heaviest songs in [Warrant's] catalog, and certainly at the top of both categories in terms of their hit singles.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/down-boys-t927275|title=Warrant - Down Boys review |publisher=[[Allmusic]]| date=| accessdate=27 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe second single was the smash hit \"[[Heaven (Warrant song)|Heaven]]\" which took Warrant's record company by surprise.

Beau had said to the band that the \"songs are really great, but I think we\u2019re a little weak in the solo department and so I like to bring somebody in\".

While trying to find a way out, the demon Belphegor possesses Jack's corpse and offers his help, blasting the souls out of the reanimated corpses. With an infestation of ghosts on the loose, the three reluctantly form an alliance with the demon. With the nearby town of [[Harlan, Kansas]] in danger, the Winchesters and Castiel begin an evacuation while facing off with many ghosts, including former enemies Constance Welch, Mary Worthington and [[John Wayne Gacy]]. The group manages to safely evacuate most of the town and Belphegor casts a spell that traps the ghosts inside the abandoned town. However, he reveals that there were two to three billion souls in Hell who were all released when Chuck opened the doors. Additionally, this opened Lucifer's Cage, potentially releasing Michael to wreak havoc as well. Castiel proves unable to heal Sam's gunshot wound from when he tried to kill Chuck and discovers a strange energy he has never felt before blocking Castiel's powers. With only a day or two to sort things out before the real authorities show up, Sam suggests that if they stop the end of the world this time, they will truly be free as Chuck has abandoned their world as he did other worlds in the past such as Apocalypse World.\n| LineColor       = C8894E\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Supernatural (season 15)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 309\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| Title           = Raising Hell\n| DirectedBy      = [[Robert Singer (producer)|Robert Singer]]\n| WrittenBy       = Brad Buckner & Eugenie Ross-Leming\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|10|17}}\n| ProdCode        = T13.21753\n| Viewers         = 1.16<ref name=\"15.02\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/thursday-final-ratings-october-17-2019/|title='Young Sheldon' and 'Legacies' adjust up, 'How to Get Away with Murder' adjusts down: Thursday final ratings|last=Rejent|first=Joseph|work=[[TV by the Numbers]]|date=October 18, 2019|accessdate=October 18, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191018220901/https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/thursday-final-ratings-october-17-2019/|archive-date=October 18, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Still in Harlan, Kansas, the Winchesters and their hunter allies struggle to contain both the ghosts and the restless citizens as the barrier begins to weaken. Led by [[Francis Tumblety]], better known as the infamous serial killer [[Jack the Ripper]], the ghosts plot their escape while killing as many people as they can. The Winchesters are joined by Rowena, who works on a spell to more permanently contain the ghosts and Arthur Ketch who reveals he was hired by a demon named Ardat to assassinate Belphegor. To their surprise, Sam and Dean also receive help from the ghost of Kevin Tran who had been cast into Hell instead of Heaven as Chuck claimed. The Winchesters succeed in containing the ghosts in a crystal, but more rise from Hell. Having learned that he cannot go to Heaven, Kevin decides to wander the Earth as a ghost rather than risk returning to Hell. At the same time, Chuck seeks the help of Amara in [[Reno, Nevada]]. Chuck is revealed to have been severely weakened and diminished when Sam shot him and Amara, seeing that her brother hasn't changed from the petulant narcissistic being he always was, refuses to help and abandons her brother who is trapped on Earth and has developed a link with Sam.\n| LineColor       = C8894E\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Supernatural (season 15)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 310\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| Title           = The Rupture\n| DirectedBy      = [[Charles Beeson (director)|Charles Beeson]]\n| WrittenBy       = Robert Berens\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|10|24}}\n| ProdCode        = T13.21754\n| Viewers         = 1.24<ref name=\"15.03\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/thursday-final-ratings-october-24-2019/|title='Law & Order: SVU' adjusts down: Thursday final ratings|last=Rejent|first=Joseph|work=TV by the Numbers|date=October 25, 2019|accessdate=October 25, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191025205529/https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/thursday-final-ratings-october-24-2019/|archive-date=October 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Rowena attempts to use a spell from the ''Book of the Damned'' to strengthen the barrier, but discovers that the barrier is too weak and will inevitably fall. Belphegor offers a solution where they retrieve Lilith's crook from Hell and use it to draw in all of the escaped souls and demons while Sam and Rowena perform a spell to close the rupture. At the same time, the demon Ardat brutally murders Arthur Ketch while seeking out Belphegor who travels into Hell with Castiel. After they retrieve the crook, Ardat attacks, revealing that Belphegor is using the Winchesters to gain power in Hell for himself. Belphegor kills Ardat and attempts to draw all of the souls and demons inside of himself to gain unlimited power, but is smote by Castiel, destroying the crook. With no other way, Rowena decides to use a spell that requires the sacrifice of her own life to draw the souls and demons inside of herself and then travel into Hell. At Rowena's request, Sam reluctantly fatally stabs Rowena who casts the souls and demons back into Hell. Sam and Dean are left devastated by the losses of Arthur and Rowena and Dean accuses Castiel of being responsible for everything going wrong.

Still reeling from the death of Rowena, Sam reluctantly joins Dean on a hunt in Beaverdale, Iowa where the head cheerleader, Suzie, was apparently killed by a vampire and another cheerleader, Tory, was abducted. Using security footage of the abduction, the Winchesters identify Suzie's boyfriend Billy's family as the culprits and rescue Tory. Billy was recently turned into a vampire and accidentally killed Suzie when he lost control of his bloodlust. Though his parents have been trying to protect him, a guilt-ridden Billy recognizes that he has become a monster and has his parents blame the murder and kidnapping on him while the Winchesters take Billy out into the woods to kill him. While Dean wants to continue fighting monsters for the sake of the people who have believed in them, Sam displays a more cynical and depressed view. At the same time, God visits Becky Rosen, having lost his sense of purpose. Becky convinces him to start writing again, but is horrified by the dark ending God has in mind for the Winchesters.

However, Andy, who hates what they are doing, kills his brother and then himself. The girl the Winchesters were protecting turns out to be [[Lilith (Supernatural)|Lilith]], resurrected by God from the Empty and in search of The Equalizer, the gun God created to kill Jack. Lilith destroys the gun and reveals that God's intended endgame is for the Winchesters to kill each other.

As Eileen fears returning to Hell or going insane, Dean suggests using Rowena's journals to create a Soul Catcher to contain her. However, Sam finds a resurrection spell Rowena was creating that could potentially bring Eileen back to life. The spell brings him into conflict with two witches who seek the spell for their own use. With the help of Dean and Eileen, Sam dispatches the witches, using a spell he learned from Rowena to kill one. At the same time, Castiel enjoys a vacation until he learns of a series of strange deaths in the area. Suspecting a djinn, Castiel helps a mother whose son has gone missing, ultimately discovering the local sheriff to be the culprit. Castiel kills the djinn with his angel blade and decides to return to helping people.

Lee explains that after a particularly bad hunt, he developed a view that the world is broken and he is owed to enjoy himself. Dean is able to kill the marid and reluctantly kills Lee, feeling that Lee is a monster and it is his duty as a hunter. At the same time, Castiel suggests exploring Sam's link with God to learn more, but it backfires and makes Sam unconscious.

Donatello discovers from Metatron's notes that God has a secret fear that he only shared with his favorite, but God briefly takes control of Donatello and threatens to destroy everything they love if they don't stop. Refusing to stop and suspecting God's favorite to be Michael, the Winchesters and Castiel travel into Hell where they learn that Rowena has become the new Queen of Hell. Rowena's demons discover that Michael is no longer in Hell and she urges Dean and Castiel to mend their relationship. Having escaped the Cage, Michael now shares control of his body with Adam, but is left directionless and kills Lilith when the demon tries to take him to God. The Winchesters and Castiel capture Michael and attempt to convince him to help them with the assistance of Adam, but the archangel refuses to hear them out. Instead, Castiel shows Michael his memories of several of God's betrayals including the war with the Darkness, the alternate reality Michael and the murder of Jack. Completely disillusioned, Michael reveals that God can be trapped and provides them with the spell to do it. The spell requires a flower that only exists in Purgatory and Michael opens a twelve-hour portal for them but refuses to stay and help.

God attempts to use Eileen to cut out the thing that is festering in Sam that is blocking God's ability to heal the wound, only to realize that it is hope. In response, God shows Sam the future if they win, where monsters run increasingly rampant upon the Earth, both innocent people and their friends die, and Castiel had to be locked in the Ma'lak Box after going crazy from taking the Mark of Cain. Sam and Dean are eventually turned into vampires and during a final confrontation, Dean kills Jody Mills before Sam is killed by Bobby. God explains that the monsters running rampant is a consequence of locking him away: without God around, darkness prevails in the world. At the same time, Dean and Castiel return to Purgatory in search of a Leviathan Blossom which they learn sprouts from the remains of a Leviathan. The two are ambushed by Leviathans working for a vengeful Eve, but manage to escape with the blossom and make up. Dean and Castiel attempt to use the spell to trap God, but Sam refuses to complete it, allowing God to heal his wound and regain his full power.

In the aftermath, Sam and Eileen share a kiss, but Eileen decides to leave for the time being.

After Castiel rescues Jack from a Grigori, the Winchester family is finally reunited. Jack explains that Billie kept him hidden in the Empty, waiting for God to leave to resurrect him. Jack has been following Billie's plan which, if he continues to follow it, will make Jack strong enough to kill God.\n| LineColor       = C8894E\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Supernatural (season 15)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 319\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 12\n| Title           = Galaxy Brain\n| DirectedBy      = Richard Speight Jr.\n| WrittenBy       = {{StoryTeleplay|s=Meredith Glynn & Robert Berens|t=Robert Berens}}\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|16}}\n| ProdCode        = T13.21762\n| Viewers         = 0.98<ref name=\"15.12\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-monday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-16-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Monday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.16.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=March 17, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=March 17, 2020}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Four weeks ago on Earth 2, God explains to a store clerk his creation of alternate worlds and his decision to end them all. As the Winchesters and Castiel deal with the return of Jack, who is still soulless, Jody Mills is kidnapped by Dark Kaia who demands that they keep their promise to her and send Dark Kaia back to the Bad Place. Dark Kaia reveals that the Bad Place is dying and their Kaia is still alive, trapped in the other world. Horrified that Kaia has been trapped for two years in another universe, the group attempts to find a way back, hindered by Jack's inability to use his powers without drawing attention. Jack eventually convinces a Reaper named Merle to help them temporarily hide his use of powers from God, allowing the Winchesters and Dark Kaia to cross to the Bad Place and rescue their Kaia. Dark Kaia chooses to die with her world as it is consumed while Kaia returns home with Jody to be reunited with Claire. In the aftermath, Billie kills Merle for her failure to keep Jack in check and warns that they must all play their parts if they are to beat God. Billie reveals that one of the books in her library describes God's ultimate demise, but refuses to explain more than the fact that Jack and the Winchesters are an integral part of it. Satisfied with the destruction he has wrought, God departs Earth 2 to continue destroying other worlds.\n| LineColor       = C8894E\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Supernatural (season 15)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 320\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 13\n| Title           = Destiny's Child\n| DirectedBy      = Amyn Kaderali\n| WrittenBy       = Brad Buckner & Eugenie Ross-Leming\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|23}}\n| ProdCode        = T13.21763\n| Viewers         = 1.06<ref name=\"15.13\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-monday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-23-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Monday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.23.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=March 24, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=March 24, 2020}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Billie warns the Winchesters that God is almost done destroying alternate universes and will soon turn his attention back to their own world. To continue Jack's quest to become stronger, Billie directs them to find the Occultum, a mysterious mystical object. The Winchesters track the Occultum to Anael who reveals that she gave it to [[Ruby (Supernatural)|Ruby]] before she died and Ruby hid it in Hell. However, this proves to be a trap as Anael hires demons to kill the Winchesters. In order to find out where it is really hidden, Castiel has Jack send him into the Empty where the Shadow, manifesting in the form of [[Meg Masters|Meg]], allows him to awaken Ruby. In exchange for Castiel promising to try to get her out, Ruby directs him to the Occultum's hiding place though Castiel is briefly tortured by the Shadow before Jack gets him out again. To keep God from knowing what they are up to, the Winchesters rescue a pair of alternate Sams and Deans trapped between worlds and have their counterparts pose as them. Though attacked by hellhounds guarding the Occultum, they are able to retrieve it and the Occultum transports Jack to the [[Garden of Eden]] where he is confronted by a mysterious young girl and the Snake before being returned to Earth. In the aftermath, the alternate Sam and Dean depart for new lives in [[Brazil]] while a crying Jack expresses remorse for Mary Winchester's death and begs forgiveness. To Sam and Dean's shock, Castiel reveals that the Garden of Eden has restored Jack's lost soul.\n| LineColor       = C8894E\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Supernatural (season 15)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 321\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 14\n| Title           = Last Holiday\n| RTitle          = <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/listings/20200312cw03/|title=(#1514) \"Last Holiday\"|work=The Futon Critic|accessdate=March 13, 2020}}</ref>\n| DirectedBy      = [[Eduardo S\u00e1nchez (director)|Eduardo Sanchez]]\n| WrittenBy       = Jeremy Adams\n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = C8894E\n}}\n{{^|Episode list/sublist|Supernatural (season 15)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 322\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 15\n| Title           = \n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = C8894E\n}}\n{{^|Episode list/sublist|Supernatural (season 15)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 323\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 16\n| Title           = \n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = C8894E\n}}\n{{^|Episode list/sublist|Supernatural (season 15)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 324\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 17\n| Title           = \n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = C8894E\n}}\n{{^|Episode list/sublist|Supernatural (season 15)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 325\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 18\n| Title           = \n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = C8894E\n}}\n{{^|Episode list/sublist|Supernatural (season 15)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 326\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 19\n| Title           = \n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = C8894E\n}}\n{{^|Episode list/sublist|Supernatural (season 15)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 327\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 20\n| Title           = \n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = C8894E\n}}\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n==Production==\nOn January 31, 2019, [[The CW]] renewed the series for a fifteenth season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/cw-renews-flash-charmed-riverdale-supernatural-6-more-1181714|title=CW Renews 'The Flash,' 'Charmed,' 'Riverdale,' 'Supernatural,' 6 More|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|last=Goldberg|first=Lesley|date=January 31, 2019|accessdate=January 31, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190202015411/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/cw-renews-flash-charmed-riverdale-supernatural-6-more-1181714|archive-date=February 2, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> On March 22, series stars [[Jared Padalecki]], [[Jensen Ackles]], and [[Misha Collins]] announced that the 20-episode fifteenth season of ''Supernatural'' would also be its last.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvline.com/2019/03/22/supernatural-final-season-15-cancelled-cw/|title=Supernatural to End With Season 15|website=[[TVLine]]|last=Gelman|first=Vlada|date=March 22, 2019|accessdate=March 22, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190322205713/https://tvline.com/2019/03/22/supernatural-final-season-15-cancelled-cw/|archive-date=March 22, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Ackles, who last directed the episode \"[[The Bad Seed (Supernatural)|The Bad Seed]]\" from the eleventh season, directed the first episode filmed for the season, which aired chronologically as the fourth episode.

While trying to find a way out, the demon Belphegor possesses Jack's corpse and offers his help, blasting the souls out of the reanimated corpses. With an infestation of ghosts on the loose, the three reluctantly form an alliance with the demon. With the nearby town of [[Harlan, Kansas]] in danger, the Winchesters and Castiel begin an evacuation while facing off with many ghosts, including former enemies Constance Welch, Mary Worthington and [[John Wayne Gacy]]. The group manages to safely evacuate most of the town and Belphegor casts a spell that traps the ghosts inside the abandoned town. However, he reveals that there were two to three billion souls in Hell who were all released when Chuck opened the doors. Additionally, this opened Lucifer's Cage, potentially releasing Michael to wreak havoc as well. Castiel proves unable to heal Sam's gunshot wound from when he tried to kill Chuck and discovers a strange energy he has never felt before blocking Castiel's powers. With only a day or two to sort things out before the real authorities show up, Sam suggests that if they stop the end of the world this time, they will truly be free as Chuck has abandoned their world as he did other worlds in the past such as Apocalypse World.\n| LineColor       = C8894E\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Supernatural (season 15)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 309\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| Title           = Raising Hell\n| DirectedBy      = [[Robert Singer (producer)|Robert Singer]]\n| WrittenBy       = Brad Buckner & Eugenie Ross-Leming\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|10|17}}\n| ProdCode        = T13.21753\n| Viewers         = 1.16<ref name=\"15.02\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/thursday-final-ratings-october-17-2019/|title='Young Sheldon' and 'Legacies' adjust up, 'How to Get Away with Murder' adjusts down: Thursday final ratings|last=Rejent|first=Joseph|work=[[TV by the Numbers]]|date=October 18, 2019|accessdate=October 18, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191018220901/https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/thursday-final-ratings-october-17-2019/|archive-date=October 18, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Still in Harlan, Kansas, the Winchesters and their hunter allies struggle to contain both the ghosts and the restless citizens as the barrier begins to weaken. Led by [[Francis Tumblety]], better known as the infamous serial killer [[Jack the Ripper]], the ghosts plot their escape while killing as many people as they can. The Winchesters are joined by Rowena, who works on a spell to more permanently contain the ghosts and Arthur Ketch who reveals he was hired by a demon named Ardat to assassinate Belphegor. To their surprise, Sam and Dean also receive help from the ghost of Kevin Tran who had been cast into Hell instead of Heaven as Chuck claimed. The Winchesters succeed in containing the ghosts in a crystal, but more rise from Hell. Having learned that he cannot go to Heaven, Kevin decides to wander the Earth as a ghost rather than risk returning to Hell. At the same time, Chuck seeks the help of Amara in [[Reno, Nevada]]. Chuck is revealed to have been severely weakened and diminished when Sam shot him and Amara, seeing that her brother hasn't changed from the petulant narcissistic being he always was, refuses to help and abandons her brother who is trapped on Earth and has developed a link with Sam.\n| LineColor       = C8894E\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Supernatural (season 15)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 310\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| Title           = The Rupture\n| DirectedBy      = [[Charles Beeson (director)|Charles Beeson]]\n| WrittenBy       = Robert Berens\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|10|24}}\n| ProdCode        = T13.21754\n| Viewers         = 1.24<ref name=\"15.03\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/thursday-final-ratings-october-24-2019/|title='Law & Order: SVU' adjusts down: Thursday final ratings|last=Rejent|first=Joseph|work=TV by the Numbers|date=October 25, 2019|accessdate=October 25, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191025205529/https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/thursday-final-ratings-october-24-2019/|archive-date=October 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Rowena attempts to use a spell from the ''Book of the Damned'' to strengthen the barrier, but discovers that the barrier is too weak and will inevitably fall. Belphegor offers a solution where they retrieve Lilith's crook from Hell and use it to draw in all of the escaped souls and demons while Sam and Rowena perform a spell to close the rupture. At the same time, the demon Ardat brutally murders Arthur Ketch while seeking out Belphegor who travels into Hell with Castiel. After they retrieve the crook, Ardat attacks, revealing that Belphegor is using the Winchesters to gain power in Hell for himself. Belphegor kills Ardat and attempts to draw all of the souls and demons inside of himself to gain unlimited power, but is smote by Castiel, destroying the crook. With no other way, Rowena decides to use a spell that requires the sacrifice of her own life to draw the souls and demons inside of herself and then travel into Hell. At Rowena's request, Sam reluctantly fatally stabs Rowena who casts the souls and demons back into Hell. Sam and Dean are left devastated by the losses of Arthur and Rowena and Dean accuses Castiel of being responsible for everything going wrong. Realizing that Dean still blames him for Mary's death, Castiel reveals that his powers are failing and decides that its time to move on with the situation seemingly under control.\n| LineColor       = C8894E\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Supernatural (season 15)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 311\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n| Title           = Atomic Monsters\n| DirectedBy      = [[Jensen Ackles]]\n| WrittenBy       = Davy Perez\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|11|7}}\n| ProdCode        = T13.21751\n| Viewers         = 1.10<ref name=\"15.04\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/tv-ratings-thursday-november-7-2019/|title=Chargers vs. Raiders adjusts up: Thursday final ratings|last=Rejent|first=Joseph|work=TV by the Numbers|date=November 8, 2019|accessdate=November 8, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191108214556/https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/tv-ratings-thursday-november-7-2019/|archive-date=November 8, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Sam experiences a nightmare where he, under the influence of demon blood, appears to be leading several demons and kills several hunters including Dean and his old vampire friend Benny. Still reeling from the death of Rowena, Sam reluctantly joins Dean on a hunt in Beaverdale, Iowa where the head cheerleader, Suzie, was apparently killed by a vampire and another cheerleader, Tory, was abducted. Using security footage of the abduction, the Winchesters identify Suzie's boyfriend Billy's family as the culprits and rescue Tory. Billy was recently turned into a vampire and accidentally killed Suzie when he lost control of his bloodlust. Though his parents have been trying to protect him, a guilt-ridden Billy recognizes that he has become a monster and has his parents blame the murder and kidnapping on him while the Winchesters take Billy out into the woods to kill him. While Dean wants to continue fighting monsters for the sake of the people who have believed in them, Sam displays a more cynical and depressed view. At the same time, God visits Becky Rosen, having lost his sense of purpose. Becky convinces him to start writing again, but is horrified by the dark ending God has in mind for the Winchesters. God makes Becky and her family vanish and begins preparing his plan to bring the Winchesters to a dark end.\n| LineColor       = C8894E\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Supernatural (season 15)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 312\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 5\n| Title           = Proverbs 17:3\n| DirectedBy      = [[Richard Speight Jr.]]\n| WrittenBy       = Steve Yockey\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|11|14}}\n| ProdCode        = T13.21755\n| Viewers         = 1.30<ref name=\"15.05\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/thursday-final-rating-november-14-2019/|title=Thursday Night Football and 'Superstore' adjust up: Thursday final ratings|last=Rejent|first=Joseph|work=TV by the Numbers|date=November 15, 2019|accessdate=November 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191115214855/https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/thursday-final-rating-november-14-2019/|archive-date=November 15, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Sam continues to have nightmares of dark alternate worlds.

However, Andy, who hates what they are doing, kills his brother and then himself. The girl the Winchesters were protecting turns out to be [[Lilith (Supernatural)|Lilith]], resurrected by God from the Empty and in search of The Equalizer, the gun God created to kill Jack. Lilith destroys the gun and reveals that God's intended endgame is for the Winchesters to kill each other.

Eileen's soul was dragged to Hell by the hellhound that killed her, but she managed to escape when God opened Hell. As Eileen fears returning to Hell or going insane, Dean suggests using Rowena's journals to create a Soul Catcher to contain her. However, Sam finds a resurrection spell Rowena was creating that could potentially bring Eileen back to life. The spell brings him into conflict with two witches who seek the spell for their own use. With the help of Dean and Eileen, Sam dispatches the witches, using a spell he learned from Rowena to kill one. At the same time, Castiel enjoys a vacation until he learns of a series of strange deaths in the area. Suspecting a djinn, Castiel helps a mother whose son has gone missing, ultimately discovering the local sheriff to be the culprit. Castiel kills the djinn with his angel blade and decides to return to helping people.

Lee explains that after a particularly bad hunt, he developed a view that the world is broken and he is owed to enjoy himself. Dean is able to kill the marid and reluctantly kills Lee, feeling that Lee is a monster and it is his duty as a hunter. At the same time, Castiel suggests exploring Sam's link with God to learn more, but it backfires and makes Sam unconscious.

Donatello discovers from Metatron's notes that God has a secret fear that he only shared with his favorite, but God briefly takes control of Donatello and threatens to destroy everything they love if they don't stop. Refusing to stop and suspecting God's favorite to be Michael, the Winchesters and Castiel travel into Hell where they learn that Rowena has become the new Queen of Hell. Rowena's demons discover that Michael is no longer in Hell and she urges Dean and Castiel to mend their relationship. Having escaped the Cage, Michael now shares control of his body with Adam, but is left directionless and kills Lilith when the demon tries to take him to God. The Winchesters and Castiel capture Michael and attempt to convince him to help them with the assistance of Adam, but the archangel refuses to hear them out. Instead, Castiel shows Michael his memories of several of God's betrayals including the war with the Darkness, the alternate reality Michael and the murder of Jack. Completely disillusioned, Michael reveals that God can be trapped and provides them with the spell to do it. The spell requires a flower that only exists in Purgatory and Michael opens a twelve-hour portal for them but refuses to stay and help.

God attempts to use Eileen to cut out the thing that is festering in Sam that is blocking God's ability to heal the wound, only to realize that it is hope. In response, God shows Sam the future if they win, where monsters run increasingly rampant upon the Earth, both innocent people and their friends die, and Castiel had to be locked in the Ma'lak Box after going crazy from taking the Mark of Cain. Sam and Dean are eventually turned into vampires and during a final confrontation, Dean kills Jody Mills before Sam is killed by Bobby. God explains that the monsters running rampant is a consequence of locking him away: without God around, darkness prevails in the world. At the same time, Dean and Castiel return to Purgatory in search of a Leviathan Blossom which they learn sprouts from the remains of a Leviathan. The two are ambushed by Leviathans working for a vengeful Eve, but manage to escape with the blossom and make up. Dean and Castiel attempt to use the spell to trap God, but Sam refuses to complete it, allowing God to heal his wound and regain his full power. God reveals that Sam's visions were actually God's memories of alternate Sam and Dean's and he is confident that they will end the same before departing. In the aftermath, Sam and Eileen share a kiss, but Eileen decides to leave for the time being.

The pool hall is revealed to be run by the goddess Fortuna who explains that her kind were in fact created by God and she holds a grudge against him. Though Fortuna wins, Sam and Dean impress her as being true heroes and she chooses to restore their luck anyway. At the same time, Castiel receives a call about a man who was murdered by having his heart ripped out and eaten and to Castiel's shock, the culprit is a resurrected Jack. Castiel discovers that Jack is targeting Grigori, fallen angels who have been feeding on the souls of innocent people, one of whom had murdered Claire Novak's mother nearly five years before. After Castiel rescues Jack from a Grigori, the Winchester family is finally reunited. Jack explains that Billie kept him hidden in the Empty, waiting for God to leave to resurrect him. Jack has been following Billie's plan which, if he continues to follow it, will make Jack strong enough to kill God.\n| LineColor       = C8894E\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Supernatural (season 15)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 319\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 12\n| Title           = Galaxy Brain\n| DirectedBy      = Richard Speight Jr.\n| WrittenBy       = {{StoryTeleplay|s=Meredith Glynn & Robert Berens|t=Robert Berens}}\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|16}}\n| ProdCode        = T13.21762\n| Viewers         = 0.98<ref name=\"15.12\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-monday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-16-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Monday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.16.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=March 17, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=March 17, 2020}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Four weeks ago on Earth 2, God explains to a store clerk his creation of alternate worlds and his decision to end them all. As the Winchesters and Castiel deal with the return of Jack, who is still soulless, Jody Mills is kidnapped by Dark Kaia who demands that they keep their promise to her and send Dark Kaia back to the Bad Place. Dark Kaia reveals that the Bad Place is dying and their Kaia is still alive, trapped in the other world. Horrified that Kaia has been trapped for two years in another universe, the group attempts to find a way back, hindered by Jack's inability to use his powers without drawing attention. Jack eventually convinces a Reaper named Merle to help them temporarily hide his use of powers from God, allowing the Winchesters and Dark Kaia to cross to the Bad Place and rescue their Kaia. Dark Kaia chooses to die with her world as it is consumed while Kaia returns home with Jody to be reunited with Claire. In the aftermath, Billie kills Merle for her failure to keep Jack in check and warns that they must all play their parts if they are to beat God. Billie reveals that one of the books in her library describes God's ultimate demise, but refuses to explain more than the fact that Jack and the Winchesters are an integral part of it.

To continue Jack's quest to become stronger, Billie directs them to find the Occultum, a mysterious mystical object. The Winchesters track the Occultum to Anael who reveals that she gave it to [[Ruby (Supernatural)|Ruby]] before she died and Ruby hid it in Hell. However, this proves to be a trap as Anael hires demons to kill the Winchesters. In order to find out where it is really hidden, Castiel has Jack send him into the Empty where the Shadow, manifesting in the form of [[Meg Masters|Meg]], allows him to awaken Ruby. In exchange for Castiel promising to try to get her out, Ruby directs him to the Occultum's hiding place though Castiel is briefly tortured by the Shadow before Jack gets him out again. To keep God from knowing what they are up to, the Winchesters rescue a pair of alternate Sams and Deans trapped between worlds and have their counterparts pose as them. Though attacked by hellhounds guarding the Occultum, they are able to retrieve it and the Occultum transports Jack to the [[Garden of Eden]] where he is confronted by a mysterious young girl and the Snake before being returned to Earth. In the aftermath, the alternate Sam and Dean depart for new lives in [[Brazil]] while a crying Jack expresses remorse for Mary Winchester's death and begs forgiveness.
