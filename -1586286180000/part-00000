As of March 2020, [[List of Progress flights|Progress spacecraft have flown]] most of the uncrewed missions to the ISS.\n\n==Spaceports==\n\n===Baikonur Cosmodrome===\n[[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] in Kazakhstan is the oldest and busiest spaceport. The first module of the ISS was launched from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 81]] as the uncrewed spacecraft [[Zarya]] in 1998 and flew uncrewed for about two years before the first crew arrived. The Progress spacecraft is the most frequent cargo ship sent from Baikonur to the station, bringing supplies such as food, fuel, gas, experiments and parts. Its light payload is offset by its ability to deliver critical replacement parts at short notice. Fresh fruit and vegetables from earth are an important part of the crew's diet.\n\n===Tanegashima Space Center===\n[[File:H-IIB F2 launching HTV2.jpg|thumb|left|Kounotori departing Tanegashima space center bound for the International Space Station]]\nLocated in Japan on an island {{convert|115|km}} south of Ky\u016bsh\u016b, the [[Tanegashima Space Center]] (TCS) is the launch site for H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV), called {{nihongo3|[[Oriental Stork]] or [[White Stork]]|\u3053\u3046\u306e\u3068\u308a|'''Kounotori'''}}, used to resupply the [[Japanese Experiment Module|''Kib\u014d'' Japanese Experiment Module]] (JEM) and the ISS. The name ''Kounotori'' was chosen for the HTV by JAXA because \"a white stork carries an image of conveying an important thing (a baby, happiness, and other joyful things), therefore, it precisely expresses the HTV's mission to transport essential materials to the ISS\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jaxa.jp/press/2010/11/20101111_kounotori_e.html |title=\"KOUNOTORI\" Chosen as Nickname of the H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV) |publisher=JAXA |date=11 November 2010 |accessdate=11 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nWhite Kounotori can carry {{convert|6000|kg}} of cargo in total, about {{convert|3500|-|4500|kg}} of which is accessible by the crew in the pressurized section, the remainder is unpressurised cargo on Exposed Pallet to be handled by the ISS's robotic arm.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://iss.jaxa.jp/en/htv/overview/ |title=HTV Overview |publisher=JAXA |accessdate=4 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Guiana Space Centre===\nThe European Space Agency (ESA) uses the [[Guiana Space Centre]] or, more commonly, Centre Spatial Guyanais (CSG). It is a French spaceport near Kourou in French Guiana. Operational since 1968, it is particularly suitable as a location for a spaceport due to its proximity to the equator, and that launches are in a favorable direction over water. The near-equatorial launch location provides an advantage for launches to low-inclination (or geostationary) Earth orbits compared to launches from spaceports at higher latitude, the eastward boost provided by the Earth's rotation is about {{convert|463|m/s}} (1,035 miles per hour) at this spaceport.\n\nThe ESA's Automated Transfer Vehicle weighs {{convert|20.7|tonnes|kg}} at launch and has a cargo capacity of {{convert|8|tonnes|kg}} ({{convert|1500|to|5500|kg}} of dry cargo, up to {{convert|1000|kg}} of water, nitrogen, oxygen, air), with up to two gases per flight, and up to {{convert|4700|kg}} of propellant for the re-boost and refueling the station.\n\n===Cape Canaveral===\n[[File:CRS-15 Mission (41281637670).jpg|thumb|left|[[SpaceX Dragon]] cargo Launch to [[ISS]] aboard a [[Falcon 9]] ]]\n[[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]], located in [[Florida]], USA, has been operational since 1950; with its first orbital launch occurring in 1958. All of NASA's crewed [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] and [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] missions were launched from the Cape, along with some of the earlier [[Apollo program|Apollo]] missions. Cape Canaveral is adjacent to the [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|Kennedy Space Center]], where the majority of Apollo missions and all\nthe [[Space Shuttle]] missions were launched from. Under contract with NASA, [[SpaceX]] launches the [[SpaceX Dragon|Dragon spacecraft]] to resupply the American portion of the ISS. The Dragon can transport {{convert|6000|kg}} of pressurized and unpressurized cargo and can return {{convert|3000|kg}} to Earth. It is the only uncrewed resupply vehicle capable of returning a payload.\n\n===Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport===\nThe [[Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport]], located at [[Wallops Island]], Virginia, USA, is the launch site for the [[Northrop Grumman]] [[Cygnus (spacecraft)|Cygnus]] spacecraft for resupplying the American portion of the ISS.\n\n==Current and completed spaceflights==\nThis is a list of uncrewed spaceflights to the International Space Station. ''Assembly flights are indicated in '''bold text'''''.\n\n''Note'': Russia has delivered cargo via the uncrewed missions of [[Progress (spacecraft)|Progress]] since the launch of the ISS, while the U.S. had used Space Shuttles for hybrid human/cargo missions, resulting in greater number of Russian uncrewed flights to the ISS. Since the discontinuation of the Space Shuttle program in 2011, the numbers of crewed and uncrewed flights by the U.S. and Russia are more closely matched.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n!

Resupply missions typically use the Russian [[Progress (spacecraft)|Progress]] spacecraft, European [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]]s, Japanese [[Kounotori (spacecraft)|Kounotori]] vehicles, and the American [[SpaceX Dragon|Dragon]] and [[Cygnus (spacecraft)|Cygnus]] spacecraft. The primary docking system for Progress spacecraft is the automated [[Kurs (docking system)|Kurs]] system, with the manual [[TORU]] system as a backup. ATVs also use Kurs, however they are not equipped with TORU. Progress and ATV can remain docked for up to six months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaMI/ATV/SEMBW0PR4CF_0.html |title=ESA&nbsp;\u2014 ATV&nbsp;\u2014 Crew role in mission control |publisher=Esa.int |date=2011-03-02 |accessdate=2011-05-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaHS/ESA4ZJ0VMOC_iss_0.html |title=ESA&nbsp;\u2014 Human Spaceflight and Exploration&nbsp;\u2014 International Space Station&nbsp;\u2014 Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) |publisher=Esa.int |date=2009-01-16 |accessdate=2011-05-23}}</ref> The other spacecraft \u2014 the Japanese [[H-II Transfer Vehicle|HTV]], the [[SpaceX Dragon]] and the Northrop Grumman<ref>https://spacenews.com/acquisition-of-orbital-atk-approved-company-renamed-northrop-grumman-innovation-systems/</ref> [[Cygnus (spacecraft)|Cygnus]] \u2014 rendezvous with the station before being grappled using [[Canadarm2]] and berthed at the [[nadir]] port of the [[Harmony (ISS module)|Harmony]] or [[Unity (ISS module)|Unity]] module for one to two months. As of March 2020, [[List of Progress flights|Progress spacecraft have flown]] most of the uncrewed missions to the ISS.\n\n==Spaceports==\n\n===Baikonur Cosmodrome===\n[[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] in Kazakhstan is the oldest and busiest spaceport. The first module of the ISS was launched from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 81]] as the uncrewed spacecraft [[Zarya]] in 1998 and flew uncrewed for about two years before the first crew arrived. The Progress spacecraft is the most frequent cargo ship sent from Baikonur to the station, bringing supplies such as food, fuel, gas, experiments and parts. Its light payload is offset by its ability to deliver critical replacement parts at short notice. Fresh fruit and vegetables from earth are an important part of the crew's diet.\n\n===Tanegashima Space Center===\n[[File:H-IIB F2 launching HTV2.jpg|thumb|left|Kounotori departing Tanegashima space center bound for the International Space Station]]\nLocated in Japan on an island {{convert|115|km}} south of Ky\u016bsh\u016b, the [[Tanegashima Space Center]] (TCS) is the launch site for H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV), called {{nihongo3|[[Oriental Stork]] or [[White Stork]]|\u3053\u3046\u306e\u3068\u308a|'''Kounotori'''}}, used to resupply the [[Japanese Experiment Module|''Kib\u014d'' Japanese Experiment Module]] (JEM) and the ISS. The name ''Kounotori'' was chosen for the HTV by JAXA because \"a white stork carries an image of conveying an important thing (a baby, happiness, and other joyful things), therefore, it precisely expresses the HTV's mission to transport essential materials to the ISS\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jaxa.jp/press/2010/11/20101111_kounotori_e.html |title=\"KOUNOTORI\" Chosen as Nickname of the H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV) |publisher=JAXA |date=11 November 2010 |accessdate=11 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nWhite Kounotori can carry {{convert|6000|kg}} of cargo in total, about {{convert|3500|-|4500|kg}} of which is accessible by the crew in the pressurized section, the remainder is unpressurised cargo on Exposed Pallet to be handled by the ISS's robotic arm.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://iss.jaxa.jp/en/htv/overview/ |title=HTV Overview |publisher=JAXA |accessdate=4 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Guiana Space Centre===\nThe European Space Agency (ESA) uses the [[Guiana Space Centre]] or, more commonly, Centre Spatial Guyanais (CSG). It is a French spaceport near Kourou in French Guiana. Operational since 1968, it is particularly suitable as a location for a spaceport due to its proximity to the equator, and that launches are in a favorable direction over water. The near-equatorial launch location provides an advantage for launches to low-inclination (or geostationary) Earth orbits compared to launches from spaceports at higher latitude, the eastward boost provided by the Earth's rotation is about {{convert|463|m/s}} (1,035 miles per hour) at this spaceport.\n\nThe ESA's Automated Transfer Vehicle weighs {{convert|20.7|tonnes|kg}} at launch and has a cargo capacity of {{convert|8|tonnes|kg}} ({{convert|1500|to|5500|kg}} of dry cargo, up to {{convert|1000|kg}} of water, nitrogen, oxygen, air), with up to two gases per flight, and up to {{convert|4700|kg}} of propellant for the re-boost and refueling the station.\n\n===Cape Canaveral===\n[[File:CRS-15 Mission (41281637670).jpg|thumb|left|[[SpaceX Dragon]] cargo Launch to [[ISS]] aboard a [[Falcon 9]] ]]\n[[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]], located in [[Florida]], USA, has been operational since 1950; with its first orbital launch occurring in 1958. All of NASA's crewed [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] and [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] missions were launched from the Cape, along with some of the earlier [[Apollo program|Apollo]] missions. Cape Canaveral is adjacent to the [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|Kennedy Space Center]], where the majority of Apollo missions and all\nthe [[Space Shuttle]] missions were launched from. Under contract with NASA, [[SpaceX]] launches the [[SpaceX Dragon|Dragon spacecraft]] to resupply the American portion of the ISS. The Dragon can transport {{convert|6000|kg}} of pressurized and unpressurized cargo and can return {{convert|3000|kg}} to Earth. It is the only uncrewed resupply vehicle capable of returning a payload.\n\n===Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport===\nThe [[Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport]], located at [[Wallops Island]], Virginia, USA, is the launch site for the [[Northrop Grumman]] [[Cygnus (spacecraft)|Cygnus]] spacecraft for resupplying the American portion of the ISS.\n\n==Current and completed spaceflights==\nThis is a list of uncrewed spaceflights to the International Space Station. ''Assembly flights are indicated in '''bold text'''''.\n\n''Note'': Russia has delivered cargo via the uncrewed missions of [[Progress (spacecraft)|Progress]] since the launch of the ISS, while the U.S. had used Space Shuttles for hybrid human/cargo missions, resulting in greater number of Russian uncrewed flights to the ISS. Since the discontinuation of the Space Shuttle program in 2011, the numbers of crewed and uncrewed flights by the U.S. and Russia are more closely matched.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n!

The moment the onion starts to [[Browning (partial cooking)|brown]], add {{convert|300|g|oz|frac=2|disp=sqbr}} of chopped from tomatoes or tomato paste, and season with salt and pepper. When the tomatoes are cooked, pour in one finger of strong [[vinegar]] or two fingers of weak vinegar, diluted in a large glass of water. Let boil for a few more minutes, then discard the garlic and strain the rest of the ingredients, pressing hard against the mesh. Put the strained sauce back on the fire along with whatever fish you may have on hand, including [[sole (fish)|sole]], [[red mullet]], [[gurnard (disambiguation)|gurnard]], [[dogfish (disambiguation)|dogfish]], [[mantis shrimp]], and other types of fish in season, leaving the small fish whole and cutting the big ones into small pieces. Taste for seasoning; but in any case it is not a bad idea to add a little [[olive oil]], since the amount of [[soffritto]] was quite small.

From the [[Devonian]] to the early [[Jurassic]] is the pre-volcanic sedimentary period. Environment of Hong Kong alternated between a river plain and a shallow sea setting. Rocks of this period are characterized by a variety of [[fossil]]s, heavily folded strata and steeply tilted beds. Later, from the middle Jurassic to the early [[Cretaceous]] period, Hong Kong experienced a volcanic period. It is marked by the massive coverage of volcanic lava, ash, and granitic rocks. From the middle Cretaceous onward, it is the post-volcanic sedimentary period. It is represented by reddish colored sedimentary rocks which as an indication of an arid tropical climate during deposition.<ref name=\":4\"/>\n\nMajor rock units in Hong Kong are shown by chronological order in the table below.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Geological Stratigraphy of Hong Kong<ref name=\":4\"/>\n!Period\n!Representative Formations\n!Dominant rock types\n!Deposition environment\n!Notes\n|-\n|Devonian (ca. 416 - 359 million years old)\n|Bluff Head formation\n|Brownish folded [[sandstone]]\n|River channels\n|the oldest rock in Hong Kong, age determined by Placoderm fossils\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Carboniferous (ca. 359 - 299 million years old)\n|Yuen Long formation\n|white or greyish [[marble]]\n|marine\n|metamorphosed in Mesozoic volcanic period, formed iron ore in [[Ma On Shan mine]]\n|-\n|Lok Ma Chau formation\n|metasandstones and siltstone [[graphite]] beds\n|deltaic swamps\n|metamorphosed in Mesozoic volcanic period\n|-\n|Permian (ca. 299 - 252 million years old)\n|Tolo Harbour formation\n|[[siltstone]], sandstone, [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]]\n|tidal shore\n|oldest [[Ammonoidea|ammonoid]] fossils in Hong Kong\n|-\n|Triassic (ca. 252 - 201 million years old)\n|missing\n|N/A\n|N/A\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |Jurassic (ca. 201 - 145 million years old)\n|Tolo Channel formation\n|black mudstone, grey siltstone\n|shallow marine\n|\n|-\n|Tuen Mun formation\n|[[Andesite|Andesitic]] lava and crystal [[tuff]] [[breccia]]\n|volcanic arc\n|Volcanic period started here.\n|-\n|Tsuen Wan Volcanic Group\n|coarse ash crystal tuff\n|back-arc volcano\n|covered a large area in New Territories\n|-\n|Lantau Volcanic Group\n|[[rhyolite]] with larger crystals (porphoritic)\n|back-arc volcano\n|related to Lantau caldera and [[Dike swarm|dyke swarm]], covered most of Lantau island\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" |Cretaceous (ca. 145 - 66 million years old)\n|Mount Davis formation\n|coarse ash crystal tuff\n|back-arc volcano\n|related to Kowloon granite\n|-\n|High Island formation\n|fine ash tuff\n|back-arc volcano\n|formed [[Columnar jointing|hexagonal columnar joint]]\n|-\n|Kau Sai Chau Volcanic Group\n|[[lapilli]] bearing tuff with rhyolitic bands\n|back-arc volcano\n|Volcanic period ended here\n|-\n|Pat Sin Leng formation\n|reddish conglomerate and ash bearing sandstone\n|river plain\n|volcanic ashes mixed with depositions, the red colour showed an arid climate\n|-\n|Port Island formation\n|reddish conglomerate and sandstone\n|river plain\n|\n|-\n|Paleogene (ca. 66 - 23 million years old)\n|Ping Chau formation\n|calcium carbonate bearing siltstones\n|lake\n|Sea stacks and wave-cut platforms are found on Ping Chau formation\n|}\n\n== Igneous rocks ==\nThe geology of Hong Kong is dominated by igneous rocks. They are rocks related to volcanic eruptions.

The crust was therefore partially melted and [[magma]] was formed. The magma rose and formed a [[magma chamber]] beneath surface. Volcanoes were therefore formed above the magma chamber. When erupted, [[volcanic ash]], pieces of rocks, and some magma were expelled. These materials then eventually cooled down and became [[volcanic rock]]s. These rocks cooled down quickly once they reached the Earth's surface. Mineral crystals in these rocks are therefore very small.\n\n'''Volcanic rocks''' are widely distributed in Hong Kong (green areas in Fig.1). They formed most of the highest mountains in Hong Kong, such as [[Tai Mo Shan]] (957&nbsp;m, the highest mountain) and [[Lantau Peak]] (934&nbsp;m, the second highest mountain).<ref name=\":02\"/> In the eastern part of Hong Kong, these volcanic rocks form hexagonal columnar cooling joints. They can be seen from the [[High Island Reservoir|High Island reservoir]] and islands nearby.

Undeformed sedimentary rocks always form horizontal layers. However, if deformed, sedimentary rocks can form deformation structures such as folds that record tectonic activities. Fossils are often better preserved in sedimentary rocks.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the oldest sedimentary rocks come from [[Devonian]] period (~416million years ago), dated by [[Placodermi|Placoderm]] (a Devonian fish) fossils discovered in Bluff Head formation in northeast [[New Territories]]. The youngest sedimentary rocks come from [[Paleogene]] (~50million years ago) in [[Tung Ping Chau]] at the very northeast of Hong Kong.<ref name=\":02\"/>\n\n=== Tung Ping Chau erosion features ===\n[[File:Tung_Ping_Chau_6.jpg|thumb|275x275px|Photo from Lung Lok Shui, Tung Ping Chau.

Various deformed structures such as folds, kink bands, microfaults and sheared rocks can be observed on Ma Shi Chau.<ref name=\":02\"/>\n\n== Metamorphic rocks ==\n[[Metamorphic rock]]s made up less than 1% of Hong Kong land surface. They are found in [[Lok Ma Chau]] near the border with [[Shenzhen]], [[Ma On Shan (town)|Ma On Shan]] and [[Yuen Long]]. However, metamorphic rocks in Ma On Shan and Yuen Long were only seen in [[borehole]]s.<ref name=\":02\"/> Metamorphic rocks are sedimentary rocks or igneous rocks that are altered under high temperature and pressure but are not melted. Atoms are re-arranged and new minerals are formed. Metamorphic rocks in Hong Kong are all altered sedimentary rocks formed in [[Carboniferous]] period. Then until the middle [[Jurassic]] volcanic activity, magma chambers were formed and they intruded into older rocks. The heat of the magma together with active movements along major faults in Hong Kong, created a high temperature and pressure environment, causing the relatively older Carboniferous sedimentary layers to alter. Rocks in Lok Ma Chau became meta-sedimentary rocks and [[phyllite]]s, which were low-grade metamorphic rocks. This indicates that Lok Ma Chau rocks were not much altered. However, rocks in Ma On Shan and Yuen Long, which were originally [[limestone]]s, became a high-grade [[marble]]. These rocks were significantly altered by the high temperature of [[Intrusive rock|magma intrusions]].<ref name=\":02\"/>\n\n=== Ma On Shan Iron ore ===\nIron ore ore bodies were found in Ma On Shan. They are both located near a granitic body, where hot magma intrusions existed during late Jurassic. The hot magma carried metal ores to the crust from the mantle as it rose. Metal ores are concentrated into hot fluids as it forced itself into cracks of the Ma On Shan limestone. The hot concentrated fluid ([[hydrothermal fluid]]) triggered chemical reactions. This process finally produced [[skarn]], which an altered rock that carried the concentrated metal ores.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Strange|first=P. J.|last2=Woods|first2=P.

It is a group of vertical sheets of rocks formed by magma and lava flowing into northeast trending cracks in pre-existing granitic rocks on Lantau Island. Those cracks were related to the northeast trending faults. The Lantau caldera, which was the volcanic centre of the magma, is also bounded by faults and exhibits an elongated shape towards the northeast. These structures recorded the active strike-slip motion of the northeast trending faults in Lantau Island during Late Jurassic. (~148 million years ago).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=D.

From the [[Devonian]] to the early [[Jurassic]] is the pre-volcanic sedimentary period. Environment of Hong Kong alternated between a river plain and a shallow sea setting. Rocks of this period are characterized by a variety of [[fossil]]s, heavily folded strata and steeply tilted beds. Later, from the middle Jurassic to the early [[Cretaceous]] period, Hong Kong experienced a volcanic period. It is marked by the massive coverage of volcanic lava, ash, and granitic rocks. From the middle Cretaceous onward, it is the post-volcanic sedimentary period. It is represented by reddish colored sedimentary rocks which as an indication of an arid tropical climate during deposition.<ref name=\":4\"/>\n\nMajor rock units in Hong Kong are shown by chronological order in the table below.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Geological Stratigraphy of Hong Kong<ref name=\":4\"/>\n!Period\n!Representative Formations\n!Dominant rock types\n!Deposition environment\n!Notes\n|-\n|Devonian (ca. 416 - 359 million years old)\n|Bluff Head formation\n|Brownish folded [[sandstone]]\n|River channels\n|the oldest rock in Hong Kong, age determined by Placoderm fossils\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Carboniferous (ca. 359 - 299 million years old)\n|Yuen Long formation\n|white or greyish [[marble]]\n|marine\n|metamorphosed in Mesozoic volcanic period, formed iron ore in Ma On Shan mine\n|-\n|Lok Ma Chau formation\n|metasandstones and siltstone [[graphite]] beds\n|deltaic swamps\n|metamorphosed in Mesozoic volcanic period\n|-\n|Permian (ca. 299 - 252 million years old)\n|Tolo Harbour formation\n|[[siltstone]], sandstone, [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]]\n|tidal shore\n|oldest [[Ammonoidea|ammonoid]] fossils in Hong Kong\n|-\n|Triassic (ca. 252 - 201 million years old)\n|missing\n|N/A\n|N/A\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |Jurassic (ca. 201 - 145 million years old)\n|Tolo Channel formation\n|black mudstone, grey siltstone\n|shallow marine\n|\n|-\n|Tuen Mun formation\n|[[Andesite|Andesitic]] lava and crystal [[tuff]] [[breccia]]\n|volcanic arc\n|Volcanic period started here.\n|-\n|Tsuen Wan Volcanic Group\n|coarse ash crystal tuff\n|back-arc volcano\n|covered a large area in New Territories\n|-\n|Lantau Volcanic Group\n|[[rhyolite]] with larger crystals (porphoritic)\n|back-arc volcano\n|related to Lantau caldera and [[Dike swarm|dyke swarm]], covered most of Lantau island\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" |Cretaceous (ca. 145 - 66 million years old)\n|Mount Davis formation\n|coarse ash crystal tuff\n|back-arc volcano\n|related to Kowloon granite\n|-\n|High Island formation\n|fine ash tuff\n|back-arc volcano\n|formed [[Columnar jointing|hexagonal columnar joint]]\n|-\n|Kau Sai Chau Volcanic Group\n|[[lapilli]] bearing tuff with rhyolitic bands\n|back-arc volcano\n|Volcanic period ended here\n|-\n|Pat Sin Leng formation\n|reddish conglomerate and ash bearing sandstone\n|river plain\n|volcanic ashes mixed with depositions, the red colour showed an arid climate\n|-\n|Port Island formation\n|reddish conglomerate and sandstone\n|river plain\n|\n|-\n|Paleogene (ca. 66 - 23 million years old)\n|Ping Chau formation\n|calcium carbonate bearing siltstones\n|lake\n|Sea stacks and wave-cut platforms are found on Ping Chau formation\n|}\n\n== Igneous rocks ==\nThe geology of Hong Kong is dominated by igneous rocks.

The Lion Rock is part of the Kowloon granite that covers Kowloon, Victoria Harbour and northern [[Hong Kong Island]]. The middle part of the Kowloon granite was subjected to heavier weathering, forming the Victoria Harbour, where Hong Kong started its development. To the north of Kowloon, granite formed the Lion Rock, and hills lining up along the northern boundary of Kowloon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cedd.gov.hk/eng/about-us/organisation/org_geo/services/pub_info/memoirs/geology/vol/klk/index.html|title=Kowloon Granite - Klk|website=www.cedd.gov.hk|access-date=2019-10-08}}</ref> Most of the buildings on the two sides of Victoria Harbour are sitting on the Kowloon granite.\n\nThe Kowloon granite exhibits a circular shape surrounding Victoria Harbour, and is surrounded by volcanic rocks.

Undeformed sedimentary rocks always form horizontal layers. However, if deformed, sedimentary rocks can form deformation structures such as folds that record tectonic activities. Fossils are often better preserved in sedimentary rocks.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the oldest sedimentary rocks come from [[Devonian]] period (~416million years ago), dated by [[Placodermi|Placoderm]] (a Devonian fish) fossils discovered in Bluff Head formation in northeast [[New Territories]]. The youngest sedimentary rocks come from [[Paleogene]] (~50million years ago) in [[Tung Ping Chau]] at the very northeast of Hong Kong.<ref name=\":02\"/>\n\n=== Tung Ping Chau erosion features ===\n[[File:Tung_Ping_Chau_6.jpg|thumb|275x275px|Photo from Lung Lok Shui, Tung Ping Chau.

This reflects a hot and humid climate during Paleogene that increase oxidation of iron in the rock and a quiet water setting which deposits fine sediments.

Red lines show the limbs,the blue line shows the axis]][[Ma Shi Chau]] is a [[tidal island]] in the [[Tolo Harbour]] in northeast New Territories. It is an important special area for geological studies. It contains rocks from three different formations: [[Permian]] sedimentary rocks, Early Cretaceous volcanic rocks and middle Cretaceous sedimentary rocks. Fossils of [[Ammonoidea|ammonoids]], corals and [[Bivalvia|bivalves]] were found in the black Permian sedimentary rocks.<ref>Yim, W. S., Nau, P. S., & Rosen, B. R. (1981).

Ma Shi Chau is very close to a major fault (Tolo channel fault).<ref name=\":4\" /> Rocks on Ma Shi Chau are therefore subjected to deformation by fault activities. Various deformed structures such as folds, kink bands, microfaults and sheared rocks can be observed on Ma Shi Chau.<ref name=\":02\"/>\n\n== Metamorphic rocks ==\n[[Metamorphic rock]]s made up less than 1% of Hong Kong land surface. They are found in [[Lok Ma Chau]] near the border with [[Shenzhen]], [[Ma On Shan (town)|Ma On Shan]] and [[Yuen Long]]. However, metamorphic rocks in Ma On Shan and Yuen Long were only seen in [[borehole]]s.<ref name=\":02\"/> Metamorphic rocks are sedimentary rocks or igneous rocks that are altered under high temperature and pressure but are not melted. Atoms are re-arranged and new minerals are formed. Metamorphic rocks in Hong Kong are all altered sedimentary rocks formed in [[Carboniferous]] period. Then until the middle [[Jurassic]] volcanic activity, magma chambers were formed and they intruded into older rocks. The heat of the magma together with active movements along major faults in Hong Kong, created a high temperature and pressure environment, causing the relatively older Carboniferous sedimentary layers to alter. Rocks in Lok Ma Chau became meta-sedimentary rocks and [[phyllite]]s, which were low-grade metamorphic rocks. This indicates that Lok Ma Chau rocks were not much altered. However, rocks in Ma On Shan and Yuen Long, which were originally [[limestone]]s, became a high-grade [[marble]]. These rocks were significantly altered by the high temperature of [[Intrusive rock|magma intrusions]].<ref name=\":02\"/>\n\n=== Ma On Shan Iron ore ===\nIron ore ore bodies were found in Ma On Shan. They are both located near a granitic body, where hot magma intrusions existed during late Jurassic. The hot magma carried metal ores to the crust from the mantle as it rose. Metal ores are concentrated into hot fluids as it forced itself into cracks of the Ma On Shan limestone. The hot concentrated fluid ([[hydrothermal fluid]]) triggered chemical reactions. This process finally produced [[skarn]], which an altered rock that carried the concentrated metal ores.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Strange|first=P. J.|last2=Woods|first2=P.

Some faults represent structures that were active during the period of Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous volcanic activity and facilitated the rise of magma to the surface. Faults in Hong Kong formed interesting features that can be traced to understand their activities.<ref name=rgs/>\n\n=== Lantau dyke swarm ===\nThe Lantau [[Dike swarm|dyke swarm]] is located on east [[Lantau Island]]. It is a group of vertical sheets of rocks formed by magma and lava flowing into northeast trending cracks in pre-existing granitic rocks on Lantau Island. Those cracks were related to the northeast trending faults. The Lantau caldera, which was the volcanic centre of the magma, is also bounded by faults and exhibits an elongated shape towards the northeast. These structures recorded the active strike-slip motion of the northeast trending faults in Lantau Island during Late Jurassic. (~148 million years ago).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=D.

This time, however, Kurzweil embraces the term ''[[Technological singularity|the Singularity]]'', which was popularized by [[Vernor Vinge]] in his 1993 essay \"The Coming Technological Singularity\" more than a decade earlier.{{sfn|Vinge|2005}}\n\nKurzweil describes his [[Accelerating change#Kurzweil's The Law of Accelerating Returns|law of accelerating returns]] which predicts an exponential increase in technologies like [[computer]]s, [[genetics]], [[nanotechnology]], [[robotics]] and [[artificial intelligence]]. Once the Singularity has been reached, Kurzweil says that machine intelligence will be infinitely more powerful than all human intelligence combined. Afterwards he predicts intelligence will radiate outward from the planet until it saturates the universe. The Singularity is also the point at which machines intelligence and humans would merge.\n\n==Content==\n\n===Exponential growth===\nKurzweil characterizes [[evolution]] throughout all time as progressing through six epochs, each one building on the one before. He says the four epochs which have occurred so far are ''Physics and Chemistry'', ''Biology and DNA'', ''Brains'', and ''Technology''. Kurzweil predicts the Singularity will coincide with the next epoch, ''The Merger of Human Technology with Human Intelligence''. After the Singularity he says the final epoch will occur, ''The Universe Wakes Up''.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2005|p=15}}\n\nKurzweil explains that evolutionary progress is [[exponential function|exponential]] because of [[positive feedback]]; the results of one stage are used to create the next stage. Exponential growth is deceptive, nearly flat at first until it hits what Kurzweil calls \"the knee in the curve\" then rises almost vertically.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2005|p=10}} In fact Kurzweil believes evolutionary progress is super-exponential because more resources are deployed to the winning process. As an example of super-exponential growth Kurzweil cites the computer chip business. The overall budget for the whole industry increases over time, since the fruits of exponential growth make it an attractive investment; meanwhile the additional budget fuels more innovation which makes the industry grow even faster, effectively an example of \"double\" exponential growth.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2005|pp=40-41}}\n\nKurzweil says evolutionary progress looks smooth, but that really it is divided into paradigms, specific methods of solving problems. Each paradigm starts with slow growth, builds to rapid growth, and then levels off. As one paradigm levels off, pressure builds to find or develop a new paradigm. So what looks like a single smooth curve is really series of smaller [[Sigmoid function|S curves]].{{sfn|Kurzweil|2005|pp=43-44}} For example, Kurzweil notes that when [[vacuum tube]]s stopped getting faster, cheaper [[transistor]]s became popular and continued the overall exponential growth.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2005|pp=67}}\n\nKurzweil calls this exponential growth the law of accelerating returns, and he believes it applies to many human-created technologies such as [[computer memory]], [[transistor]]s, [[microprocessor]]s, [[DNA sequencing]], [[magnetic storage]], [[history of the Internet|the number of Internet hosts]], [[Internet traffic]], decrease in device size, and nanotech citations and patents.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2005|pp=56-84}} Kurzweil cites two historical examples of exponential growth: the [[Human Genome Project]] and the [[Internet growth|growth of the Internet]].{{sfn|Kurzweil|2005|p=12}} Kurzweil claims the whole world economy is in fact growing exponentially, although short term booms and busts tend to hide this trend.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2005|p=97}}\n\n===Computational capacity===\n[[File:PPTMooresLawai.jpg|thumb|alt=Plot showing Moore's law|[[Moore's Law]]]]\n[[File:Moore's_Law_over_120_Years.png|thumb|213x213px|An updated version of Moore's Law over 120 Years (based on [[Ray Kurzweil|Kurzweil's]] [[c:File:PPTMooresLawai.jpg|graph]]). The 7 most recent data points are all [[Nvidia GPUs|NVIDIA GPUs]].]]\n\nA fundamental pillar of Kurzweil's argument is that to get to the Singularity, computational capacity is as much of a bottleneck as other things like quality of algorithms and understanding of the human brain. [[Moore's Law]] predicts the capacity of integrated circuits grows exponentially, but not indefinitely. Kurzweil feels the increase in the capacity of integrated circuits will probably slow by the year 2020.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=67}} He feels confident that a new paradigm will debut at that point to carry on the exponential growth predicted by his law of accelerating returns. Kurzweil describes four paradigms of computing that came before integrated circuits: electromechanical, relay, vacuum tube, and transistors.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=67}}  What technology will follow integrated circuits, to serve as the sixth paradigm, is unknown, but Kurzweil believes nanotubes are the most likely alternative among a number of possibilities:\n<blockquote>nanotubes and nanotube circuitry, molecular computing, self-assembly in nanotube circuits, biological systems emulating circuit assembly, [[Dna computing|computing with DNA]], [[spintronics]] (computing with the spin of electrons), [[Optical computing|computing with light]], and [[quantum computing]].{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|pp=112-113}}</blockquote>\n\nSince Kurzweil believes [[computational capacity]] will continue to grow exponentially long after Moore's Law ends it will eventually rival the raw computing power of the human brain. Kurzweil looks at several different estimates of how much computational capacity is in the brain and settles on 10<sup>16</sup> calculations per second and 10<sup>13</sup> bits of memory. He writes that $1,000 will buy computer power equal to a single brain \"by around 2020\"{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=126}} while by 2045, the onset of the Singularity, he says the same amount of money will buy one billion times more power than all human brains combined today.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=136}} Kurzweil admits the exponential trend in increased computing power will hit a limit eventually, but he calculates that limit to be trillions of times beyond what is necessary for the Singularity.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=134}}\n\n===The brain===\n[[File:PPTExponentialGrowthof Computing.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Plot showing the exponential growth of computing|Exponential Growth of Computing]]\n\nKurzweil notes that computational capacity alone will not create artificial intelligence. He asserts that the best way to build machine intelligence is to first understand human intelligence. The first step is to image the brain, to peer inside it. Kurzweil claims imaging technologies such as [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] and [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] are increasing exponentially in resolution{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|pp=160-161}} while he predicts even greater detail will be obtained during the 2020s when it becomes possible to scan the brain from the inside using nanobots.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=163-167}} Once the physical structure and connectivity information are known, Kurzweil says researchers will have to produce functional models of sub-cellular components and synapses all the way up to whole brain regions.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|pp=167-181}} The human brain is \"a complex hierarchy of complex systems, but it does not represent a level of complexity beyond what we are already capable of handling\".{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=145}}\n\nBeyond reverse engineering the brain in order to understand and emulate it, Kurzweil introduces the idea of \"uploading\" a specific brain with every mental process intact, to be instantiated on a \"suitably powerful computational substrate\". He writes that general modeling requires 10<sup>16</sup> calculations per second and 10<sup>13</sup> bits of memory, but then explains uploading requires additional detail, perhaps as many as 10<sup>19</sup> cps and 10<sup>18</sup> bits. Kurzweil says the technology to do this will be available by 2040.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|pp=199-200}} Rather than an instantaneous scan and conversion to digital form, Kurzweil feels humans will most likely experience gradual conversion as portions of their brain are augmented with neural implants, increasing their proportion of non-biological intelligence slowly over time.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|pp=201}}\n\nKurzweil believes there is \"no objective test that can conclusively determine\" the presence of consciousness.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=378}} Therefore, he says nonbiological intelligences will claim to have consciousness and \"the full range of emotional and spiritual experiences that humans claim to have\";{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=377}} he feels such claims will generally be accepted.\n\n===Genetics, nanotechnology and robotics (AI)===\nKurzweil says revolutions in [[genetics]], [[nanotechnology]] and [[robotics]] will usher in the beginning of the Singularity.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=205}} Kurzweil feels with sufficient genetic technology it should be possible to maintain the body indefinitely, reversing aging while curing [[cancer]], [[heart disease]] and other illnesses.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|pp=212-219}} Much of this will be possible thanks to nanotechnology, the second revolution, which entails the molecule by molecule construction of tools which themselves can \"rebuild the physical world\".{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|pp=226-227}} Finally, the revolution in robotics will really be the development of strong AI, defined as machines which have human-level intelligence or greater.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=260}} This development will be the most important of the century, \"comparable in importance to the development of biology itself\".{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=296}}\n\nKurzweil concedes that every technology carries with it the risk of misuse or abuse, from viruses and nanobots to out-of-control AI machines. He believes the only countermeasure is to invest in defensive technologies, for example by allowing new genetics and medical treatments, monitoring for dangerous pathogens, and creating limited moratoriums on certain technologies. As for artificial intelligence Kurzweil feels the best defense is to increase the \"values of liberty, tolerance, and respect for knowledge and diversity\" in society, because \"the nonbiological intelligence will be embedded in our society and will reflect our values\".{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|pp=422-424}}\n\n===The Singularity===\n{{main|Technological singularity}}\n[[File:Countdown_to_Singularity_-_Linear.svg|thumb|alt=Plot showing the countdown the singularity|Countdown to the Singularity]]\n\nKurzweil touches on the history of the Singularity concept, tracing it back to [[John von Neumann]] in the 1950s and [[I. J. Good]] in the 1960s. He compares his Singularity to that of a mathematical or astrophysical singularity. While his ideas of a Singularity is not actually infinite, he says it looks that way from any limited perspective.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2005|p=23}}\n\nDuring the Singularity, Kurzweil predicts that \"human life will be irreversibly transformed\"{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=7}} and that humans will transcend the \"limitations of our biological bodies and brain\".{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=9}} He looks beyond the Singularity to say that \"the intelligence that will emerge will continue to represent the human civilization.\" Further, he feels that \"future machines will be human, even if they are not biological\".{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=30}}\n\nKurzweil claims once nonbiological intelligence predominates the nature of human life will be radically altered:{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=299}} there will be radical changes in how humans learn, work, play, and wage war.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2005|pp=331-341}} Kurzweil envisions nanobots which allow people to eat whatever they want while remaining thin and fit, provide copious energy, fight off infections or cancer, replace organs and augment their brains. Eventually people's bodies will contain so much augmentation they'll be able to alter their \"physical manifestation at will\".{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|pp=301-310}}\n\nKurzweil says the law of accelerating returns suggests that once a civilization develops primitive mechanical technologies, it is only a few centuries before they achieve everything outlined in the book, at which point it will start expanding outward, saturating the universe with intelligence. Since people have found no evidence of other civilizations, Kurzweil believes humans are likely alone in the universe. Thus Kurzweil concludes it is humanity's destiny to do the saturating, enlisting all matter and energy in the process.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=344}}{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=365}}\n\nAs for individual identities during these radical changes, Kurzweil suggests people think of themselves as an evolving pattern rather than a specific collection of molecules. Kurzweil says evolution moves towards \"greater complexity, greater elegance, greater knowledge, greater intelligence, greater beauty, greater creativity, and greater levels of subtle attributes such as love\".{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=389}} He says that these attributes, in the limit, are generally used to describe God. That means, he continues, that evolution is moving towards a conception of God and that the transition away from biological roots is in fact a spiritual undertaking.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=389}}\n\n==Predictions==\n{{Main|Predictions made by Ray Kurzweil#The_Singularity_is_Near_(2005)|l1=Predictions made by Ray Kurzweil}}\n\nKurzweil does not include an actual written timeline of the past and future, as he did in ''The Age of Intelligent Machines'' and ''The Age of Spiritual Machines'', however he still makes many specific predictions. Kurzweil writes that by 2010 a supercomputer will have the computational capacity to emulate human intelligence{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=25}} and \"by around 2020\" this same capacity will be available \"for one thousand dollars\".{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=126}} After that milestone he expects human brain scanning to contribute to an effective model of human intelligence \"by the mid-2020s\".{{sfn|Kurzweil|2005|p=25}} These two elements will culminate in computers that can pass the [[Turing test]] by 2029.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2005|p=200}} By the early 2030s the amount of non-biological computation will exceed the \"capacity of all living biological human intelligence\".{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=125}} Finally the exponential growth in computing capacity will lead to the Singularity. Kurzweil spells out the date very clearly: \"I set the date for the Singularity\u2014representing a profound and disruptive transformation in human capability\u2014as 2045\".{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=136}}\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Analysis===\nA common criticism of the book relates to the \"exponential growth fallacy\". As an example, in 1969, man landed on the moon. Extrapolating exponential growth from there one would expect huge lunar bases and manned missions to distant planets. Instead, exploration stalled or even regressed after that. [[Paul Davies]] writes \"the key point about exponential growth is that it never lasts\"<ref name=davies /> often due to resource constraints. On the other hand, it has been shown that the global acceleration until recently followed a hyperbolic rather than exponential pattern.<ref>Korotayev, Andrey.

''Journal of Big History'' 2/3 (2018): 83-84.</ref>\n\n[[Theodore Modis]] says \"nothing in nature follows a pure exponential\" and suggests the [[logistic function]] is a better fit for \"a real growth process\". The logistic function looks like an exponential at first but then tapers off and flattens completely. For example, world population and the United States's oil production both appeared to be rising exponentially, but both have leveled off because they were logistic. Kurzweil says  \"the knee in the curve\" is the time when the exponential trend is going to explode, while Modis claims if the process is logistic when you hit the \"knee\" the quantity you are measuring is only going to increase by a factor of 100 more.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Modis|first=Theodore|title=The Singularity Myth|journal=Technological Forecasting & Social Change|year=2006|volume=73.2|url=http://www.growth-dynamics.com/articles/Kurzweil.htm|accessdate=2013-02-13|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030072409/http://www.growth-dynamics.com/articles/Kurzweil.htm|archivedate=2012-10-30}}</ref>\n\nWhile some critics complain that the law of accelerating returns is not a law of nature<ref name=davies /> others question the religious motivations or implications of Kurzweil's Singularity. The buildup towards the Singularity is compared with Judeo-Christian end-of-time scenarios. Beam calls it \"a [[Buck Rogers]] vision of the hypothetical Christian Rapture\".<ref name=beam /> [[John N. Gray|John Gray]] says \"the Singularity echoes apocalyptic myths in which history is about to be interrupted by a world-transforming event\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gray|first=John|title=On the Road to Immortality|journal=The New York Review of Books|date=2011-11-24|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/nov/24/road-immortality/?pagination=false|accessdate=2013-03-19}}</ref>\n\nThe radical nature of Kurzweil's predictions is often discussed. [[Anthony Doerr]] says that before you \"dismiss it as techno-zeal\" consider that \"every day the line between what is human and what is not quite human blurs a bit more\". He lists technology of the day, in 2006, like computers that land [[Supersonic aircraft|supersonic airplanes]] or [[In vitro fertilisation|in vitro fertility treatments]] and asks whether [[brain implants]] that access the internet or robots in our blood really are that unbelievable.<ref name=doerr />\n\nIn regard to reverse engineering the brain, neuroscientist [[David Linden|David J. Linden]] writes that \"Kurzweil is conflating biological data collection with biological insight\". He feels that data collection might be growing exponentially, but insight is increasing only linearly. For example, the speed and cost of sequencing genomes is also improving exponentially, but our understanding of genetics is growing very slowly. As for nanobots Linden believes the spaces available in the brain for navigation are simply too small. He acknowledges that someday we will fully understand the brain, just not on Kurzweil's timetable.<ref>{{cite web|last=Linden|first=David|title=The Singularity is Far: A Neruoscientist's View|url=http://boingboing.net/2011/07/14/far.html|publisher=Boing Boing|accessdate=2013-02-19}}</ref>\n\n===Reviews===\n[[Paul Davies]] wrote in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' that ''The Singularity is Near'' is a \"breathless romp across the outer reaches of technological possibility\" while warning that the \"exhilarating speculation is great fun to read, but needs to be taken with a huge dose of salt.\"<ref name=\"davies\">{{cite journal|last=Davies|first=Paul|title=When computers take over|journal=Nature|date=2006-03-23|volume=440|pages=421\u2013422|url=http://www.singularity.com/When_computers_take_over.pdf|accessdate=2013-02-15|doi=10.1038/440421a }}</ref>\n\n[[Anthony Doerr]] in [[The Boston Globe]] wrote \"Kurzweil's book is surprisingly elaborate, smart, and persuasive.

Inspired by the book, Ptolemy directed and produced the film ''[[Transcendent Man]]'', which went on to bring more attention to the book.\n\nKurzweil also directed his own film adaptation, produced in partnership with [[Terasem Movement|Terasem]]; ''The Singularity is Near'' mixes documentary interviews with a science-fiction story involving his robotic avatar Ramona's transformation into an [[artificial general intelligence]]. Screened at the [[World Film Festival]], the [[Woodstock Film Festival]], the [[Warsaw International FilmFest]], the [[San Antonio Film Festival]] in 2010 and the [[San Francisco Indie Film Festival]] in 2011, the movie was released generally on July 20, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Release dates for The Singularity Is Near|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1049412/releaseinfo|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=2013-02-14}}</ref> It is available on DVD or digital download.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://store.singularity.com/|title=The Singularity Is Near, The Movie}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://singularity.com/themovie/ |title=''Singularity Is Near'' movie trailer}}</ref>\n\nThe 2014 film ''[[Lucy (2014 film)|Lucy]]'' is roughly based upon the predictions made by Kurzweil about what the year 2045 will look like, including the immortality of man.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://beginningandend.com/the-lucy-film-transhumanisms-false-promise-to-become-a-god/|title=The Lucy Film: Transhumanism's False Promise To Become A God - Beginning And End|work=Beginning And End}}</ref>\n\n==Translations==\n* [[:zh:\u5947\u9ede\u8feb\u8fd1|\u5947\u70b9\u8feb\u8fd1]] [\u5947\u70b9\u4e34\u8fd1] Translator: Zhenhua Dong\n* Dutch: De singulariteit is nabij\n* French: L'humanit\u00e9 2.0\n* Hungarian: A szingularit\u00e1s k\u00fcsz\u00f6b\u00e9n\n* Italian: La singolarit\u00e0 \u00e8 vicina\n* Korean: \ud2b9\uc774\uc810\uc774 \uc628\ub2e4\n* Spanish: La Singularidad est\u00e1 cerca\n* German: Menschheit 2.0\n* Polish: Nadchodzi Osobliwo\u015b\u0107\n* Hebrew:  Kineret \u05d4\u05e1\u05d9\u05e0\u05d2\u05d5\u05dc\u05e8\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea \u05de\u05ea\u05e7\u05e8\u05d1\u05ea 2012\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Limits to computation]]\n* [[Paradigm shift]]\n* [[Simulated reality]]\n* [[Singularitarianism]]\n* [[Technological singularity]]\n<!-- * [[Timeline of the future in forecasts]] -->\n* [[Transcendent Man]]\n* [[Transhumanism]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|last=Kurzweil|first=Ray|title=The Singularity is Near|year=2005|publisher=Viking Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-670-03384-3|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/singularityisnea00kurz}} [http://hfg-resources.googlecode.com/files/SingularityIsNear.pdf PDF]\n* {{cite web|last=Vinge|first=Vernor|title=Vernor Vinge on the Singularity|url=http://mindstalk.net/vinge/vinge-sing.html|publisher=San Diego State University|date=1993|accessdate=11 April 2013}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.singularity.com Singularity.com, Official Site for the Book]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110728121511/http://www.viceland.com/int/v16n4/htdocs/ray-kurzweil-800.php ''Vice'' Magazine interview with Ray Kurzweil] - Link down, 5/11/15\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cc5gIj3jz44 Documentary- ''The Singularity of Ray Kurzweil'' on YouTube]\n* [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB112811088248757062 ''Wall Street Journal'' review by Glenn Harlan Reynolds]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121120071541/http://www.johnhorgan.org/brain_chips_and_other_dreams_of_the_cyber_evangelists_43702.htm ''Brain Chips and Other Dreams of the Cyber-Evangelists'' by John Horgan]\n* {{IMDb title|1049412}}\n* [https://spectrum.ieee.org/singularity ''IEEE Spectrum special report on the Singularity'']\n* [http://www.ted.com/talks/aubrey_de_grey_says_we_can_avoid_aging.html Aubrey de Gray: A roadmap to end aging]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Singularity Is Near}}\n[[Category:Books by Ray Kurzweil]]\n[[Category:2005 non-fiction books]]\n[[Category:Futurology books]]\n[[Category:Singularitarianism]]\n[[Category:Transhumanist books]]\n[[Category:Futurology documentaries]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox book\n|name             = The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology\n|title_orig       =\n|translator       =\n|image            = The-Singularity-Is-Near.jpg\n|caption          =\n|alt=Cover of The Singularity is Near\n|author           = [[Raymond Kurzweil]]\n|illustrator      =\n|cover_artist     =\n|country          = United States\n|language         = English\n|series           =\n|subject          =\n|genre            =\n|publisher        = Viking\n|pub_date         = 2005\n|english_pub_date =\n|media_type       =\n|pages            = 652\n|isbn             = 978-0-670-03384-3\n|oclc             = 57201348\n|dewey            = 153.9\n|congress         = QP376 .K85\n|preceded_by      = [[The Age of Spiritual Machines]]\n|followed_by      = [[How to Create a Mind|How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed]]\n}}\n'''''The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology''''' is a 2005 non-fiction book about [[artificial intelligence]] and the future of humanity by inventor and [[futurist]] [[Ray Kurzweil]].\n\nThe book builds on the ideas introduced in Kurzweil's previous books, ''[[The Age of Intelligent Machines]]'' (1990) and ''[[The Age of Spiritual Machines]]'' (1999). This time, however, Kurzweil embraces the term ''[[Technological singularity|the Singularity]]'', which was popularized by [[Vernor Vinge]] in his 1993 essay \"The Coming Technological Singularity\" more than a decade earlier.{{sfn|Vinge|2005}}\n\nKurzweil describes his [[Accelerating change#Kurzweil's The Law of Accelerating Returns|law of accelerating returns]] which predicts an exponential increase in technologies like [[computer]]s, [[genetics]], [[nanotechnology]], [[robotics]] and [[artificial intelligence]]. Once the Singularity has been reached, Kurzweil says that machine intelligence will be infinitely more powerful than all human intelligence combined. Afterwards he predicts intelligence will radiate outward from the planet until it saturates the universe. The Singularity is also the point at which machines intelligence and humans would merge.\n\n==Content==\n\n===Exponential growth===\nKurzweil characterizes [[evolution]] throughout all time as progressing through six epochs, each one building on the one before. He says the four epochs which have occurred so far are ''Physics and Chemistry'', ''Biology and DNA'', ''Brains'', and ''Technology''. Kurzweil predicts the Singularity will coincide with the next epoch, ''The Merger of Human Technology with Human Intelligence''. After the Singularity he says the final epoch will occur, ''The Universe Wakes Up''.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2005|p=15}}\n\nKurzweil explains that evolutionary progress is [[exponential function|exponential]] because of [[positive feedback]]; the results of one stage are used to create the next stage. Exponential growth is deceptive, nearly flat at first until it hits what Kurzweil calls \"the knee in the curve\" then rises almost vertically.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2005|p=10}} In fact Kurzweil believes evolutionary progress is super-exponential because more resources are deployed to the winning process. As an example of super-exponential growth Kurzweil cites the computer chip business. The overall budget for the whole industry increases over time, since the fruits of exponential growth make it an attractive investment; meanwhile the additional budget fuels more innovation which makes the industry grow even faster, effectively an example of \"double\" exponential growth.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2005|pp=40-41}}\n\nKurzweil says evolutionary progress looks smooth, but that really it is divided into paradigms, specific methods of solving problems. Each paradigm starts with slow growth, builds to rapid growth, and then levels off. As one paradigm levels off, pressure builds to find or develop a new paradigm. So what looks like a single smooth curve is really series of smaller [[Sigmoid function|S curves]].{{sfn|Kurzweil|2005|pp=43-44}} For example, Kurzweil notes that when [[vacuum tube]]s stopped getting faster, cheaper [[transistor]]s became popular and continued the overall exponential growth.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2005|pp=67}}\n\nKurzweil calls this exponential growth the law of accelerating returns, and he believes it applies to many human-created technologies such as [[computer memory]], [[transistor]]s, [[microprocessor]]s, [[DNA sequencing]], [[magnetic storage]], [[history of the Internet|the number of Internet hosts]], [[Internet traffic]], decrease in device size, and nanotech citations and patents.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2005|pp=56-84}} Kurzweil cites two historical examples of exponential growth: the [[Human Genome Project]] and the [[Internet growth|growth of the Internet]].{{sfn|Kurzweil|2005|p=12}} Kurzweil claims the whole world economy is in fact growing exponentially, although short term booms and busts tend to hide this trend.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2005|p=97}}\n\n===Computational capacity===\n[[File:PPTMooresLawai.jpg|thumb|alt=Plot showing Moore's law|[[Moore's Law]]]]\n[[File:Moore's_Law_over_120_Years.png|thumb|213x213px|An updated version of Moore's Law over 120 Years (based on [[Ray Kurzweil|Kurzweil\u2019s]] [[c:File:PPTMooresLawai.jpg|graph]]). The 7 most recent data points are all [[Nvidia GPUs|NVIDIA GPUs]].]]\n\nA fundamental pillar of Kurzweil's argument is that to get to the Singularity, computational capacity is as much of a bottleneck as other things like quality of algorithms and understanding of the human brain. [[Moore's Law]] predicts the capacity of integrated circuits grows exponentially, but not indefinitely. Kurzweil feels the increase in the capacity of integrated circuits will probably slow by the year 2020.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=67}} He feels confident that a new paradigm will debut at that point to carry on the exponential growth predicted by his law of accelerating returns. Kurzweil describes four paradigms of computing that came before integrated circuits: electromechanical, relay, vacuum tube, and transistors.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=67}}  What technology will follow integrated circuits, to serve as the sixth paradigm, is unknown, but Kurzweil believes nanotubes are the most likely alternative among a number of possibilities:\n<blockquote>nanotubes and nanotube circuitry, molecular computing, self-assembly in nanotube circuits, biological systems emulating circuit assembly, [[Dna computing|computing with DNA]], [[spintronics]] (computing with the spin of electrons), [[Optical computing|computing with light]], and [[quantum computing]].{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|pp=112-113}}</blockquote>\n\nSince Kurzweil believes [[computational capacity]] will continue to grow exponentially long after Moore's Law ends it will eventually rival the raw computing power of the human brain. Kurzweil looks at several different estimates of how much computational capacity is in the brain and settles on 10<sup>16</sup> calculations per second and 10<sup>13</sup> bits of memory. He writes that $1,000 will buy computer power equal to a single brain \"by around 2020\"{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=126}} while by 2045, the onset of the Singularity, he says the same amount of money will buy one billion times more power than all human brains combined today.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=136}} Kurzweil admits the exponential trend in increased computing power will hit a limit eventually, but he calculates that limit to be trillions of times beyond what is necessary for the Singularity.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=134}}\n\n===The brain===\n[[File:PPTExponentialGrowthof Computing.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Plot showing the exponential growth of computing|Exponential Growth of Computing]]\n\nKurzweil notes that computational capacity alone will not create artificial intelligence. He asserts that the best way to build machine intelligence is to first understand human intelligence. The first step is to image the brain, to peer inside it. Kurzweil claims imaging technologies such as [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] and [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] are increasing exponentially in resolution{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|pp=160-161}} while he predicts even greater detail will be obtained during the 2020s when it becomes possible to scan the brain from the inside using nanobots.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=163-167}} Once the physical structure and connectivity information are known, Kurzweil says researchers will have to produce functional models of sub-cellular components and synapses all the way up to whole brain regions.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|pp=167-181}} The human brain is \"a complex hierarchy of complex systems, but it does not represent a level of complexity beyond what we are already capable of handling\".{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=145}}\n\nBeyond reverse engineering the brain in order to understand and emulate it, Kurzweil introduces the idea of \"uploading\" a specific brain with every mental process intact, to be instantiated on a \"suitably powerful computational substrate\". He writes that general modeling requires 10<sup>16</sup> calculations per second and 10<sup>13</sup> bits of memory, but then explains uploading requires additional detail, perhaps as many as 10<sup>19</sup> cps and 10<sup>18</sup> bits. Kurzweil says the technology to do this will be available by 2040.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|pp=199-200}} Rather than an instantaneous scan and conversion to digital form, Kurzweil feels humans will most likely experience gradual conversion as portions of their brain are augmented with neural implants, increasing their proportion of non-biological intelligence slowly over time.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|pp=201}}\n\nKurzweil believes there is \"no objective test that can conclusively determine\" the presence of consciousness.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=378}} Therefore, he says nonbiological intelligences will claim to have consciousness and \"the full range of emotional and spiritual experiences that humans claim to have\";{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=377}} he feels such claims will generally be accepted.\n\n===Genetics, nanotechnology and robotics (AI)===\nKurzweil says revolutions in [[genetics]], [[nanotechnology]] and [[robotics]] will usher in the beginning of the Singularity.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=205}} Kurzweil feels with sufficient genetic technology it should be possible to maintain the body indefinitely, reversing aging while curing [[cancer]], [[heart disease]] and other illnesses.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|pp=212-219}} Much of this will be possible thanks to nanotechnology, the second revolution, which entails the molecule by molecule construction of tools which themselves can \"rebuild the physical world\".{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|pp=226-227}} Finally, the revolution in robotics will really be the development of strong AI, defined as machines which have human-level intelligence or greater.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=260}} This development will be the most important of the century, \"comparable in importance to the development of biology itself\".{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=296}}\n\nKurzweil concedes that every technology carries with it the risk of misuse or abuse, from viruses and nanobots to out-of-control AI machines. He believes the only countermeasure is to invest in defensive technologies, for example by allowing new genetics and medical treatments, monitoring for dangerous pathogens, and creating limited moratoriums on certain technologies. As for artificial intelligence Kurzweil feels the best defense is to increase the \"values of liberty, tolerance, and respect for knowledge and diversity\" in society, because \"the nonbiological intelligence will be embedded in our society and will reflect our values\".{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|pp=422-424}}\n\n===The Singularity===\n{{main|Technological singularity}}\n[[File:Countdown_to_Singularity_-_Linear.svg|thumb|alt=Plot showing the countdown the singularity|Countdown to the Singularity]]\n\nKurzweil touches on the history of the Singularity concept, tracing it back to [[John von Neumann]] in the 1950s and [[I. J. Good]] in the 1960s. He compares his Singularity to that of a mathematical or astrophysical singularity. While his ideas of a Singularity is not actually infinite, he says it looks that way from any limited perspective.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2005|p=23}}\n\nDuring the Singularity, Kurzweil predicts that \"human life will be irreversibly transformed\"{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=7}} and that humans will transcend the \"limitations of our biological bodies and brain\".{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=9}} He looks beyond the Singularity to say that \"the intelligence that will emerge will continue to represent the human civilization.\" Further, he feels that \"future machines will be human, even if they are not biological\".{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=30}}\n\nKurzweil claims once nonbiological intelligence predominates the nature of human life will be radically altered:{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=299}} there will be radical changes in how humans learn, work, play, and wage war.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2005|pp=331-341}} Kurzweil envisions nanobots which allow people to eat whatever they want while remaining thin and fit, provide copious energy, fight off infections or cancer, replace organs and augment their brains. Eventually people's bodies will contain so much augmentation they'll be able to alter their \"physical manifestation at will\".{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|pp=301-310}}\n\nKurzweil says the law of accelerating returns suggests that once a civilization develops primitive mechanical technologies, it is only a few centuries before they achieve everything outlined in the book, at which point it will start expanding outward, saturating the universe with intelligence. Since people have found no evidence of other civilizations, Kurzweil believes humans are likely alone in the universe. Thus Kurzweil concludes it is humanity's destiny to do the saturating, enlisting all matter and energy in the process.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=344}}{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=365}}\n\nAs for individual identities during these radical changes, Kurzweil suggests people think of themselves as an evolving pattern rather than a specific collection of molecules. Kurzweil says evolution moves towards \"greater complexity, greater elegance, greater knowledge, greater intelligence, greater beauty, greater creativity, and greater levels of subtle attributes such as love\".{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=389}} He says that these attributes, in the limit, are generally used to describe God. That means, he continues, that evolution is moving towards a conception of God and that the transition away from biological roots is in fact a spiritual undertaking.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=389}}\n\n==Predictions==\n{{Main|Predictions made by Ray Kurzweil#The_Singularity_is_Near_(2005)|l1=Predictions made by Ray Kurzweil}}\n\nKurzweil does not include an actual written timeline of the past and future, as he did in ''The Age of Intelligent Machines'' and ''The Age of Spiritual Machines'', however he still makes many specific predictions. Kurzweil writes that by 2010 a supercomputer will have the computational capacity to emulate human intelligence{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=25}} and \"by around 2020\" this same capacity will be available \"for one thousand dollars\".{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=126}} After that milestone he expects human brain scanning to contribute to an effective model of human intelligence \"by the mid-2020s\".{{sfn|Kurzweil|2005|p=25}} These two elements will culminate in computers that can pass the [[Turing test]] by 2029.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2005|p=200}} By the early 2030s the amount of non-biological computation will exceed the \"capacity of all living biological human intelligence\".{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=125}} Finally the exponential growth in computing capacity will lead to the Singularity. Kurzweil spells out the date very clearly: \"I set the date for the Singularity\u2014representing a profound and disruptive transformation in human capability\u2014as 2045\".{{sfn|Kurzweil|2006|p=136}}\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Analysis===\nA common criticism of the book relates to the \"exponential growth fallacy\". As an example, in 1969, man landed on the moon. Extrapolating exponential growth from there one would expect huge lunar bases and manned missions to distant planets. Instead, exploration stalled or even regressed after that. [[Paul Davies]] writes \"the key point about exponential growth is that it never lasts\"<ref name=davies /> often due to resource constraints. On the other hand, it has been shown that the global acceleration until recently followed a hyperbolic rather than exponential pattern.<ref>Korotayev, Andrey.

''Journal of Big History'' 2/3 (2018): 83-84.</ref>\n\n[[Theodore Modis]] says \"nothing in nature follows a pure exponential\" and suggests the [[logistic function]] is a better fit for \"a real growth process\". The logistic function looks like an exponential at first but then tapers off and flattens completely. For example, world population and the United States's oil production both appeared to be rising exponentially, but both have leveled off because they were logistic. Kurzweil says  \"the knee in the curve\" is the time when the exponential trend is going to explode, while Modis claims if the process is logistic when you hit the \"knee\" the quantity you are measuring is only going to increase by a factor of 100 more.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Modis|first=Theodore|title=The Singularity Myth|journal=Technological Forecasting & Social Change|year=2006|volume=73.2|url=http://www.growth-dynamics.com/articles/Kurzweil.htm|accessdate=2013-02-13|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030072409/http://www.growth-dynamics.com/articles/Kurzweil.htm|archivedate=2012-10-30}}</ref>\n\nWhile some critics complain that the law of accelerating returns is not a law of nature<ref name=davies /> others question the religious motivations or implications of Kurzweil's Singularity. The buildup towards the Singularity is compared with Judeo-Christian end-of-time scenarios. Beam calls it \"a [[Buck Rogers]] vision of the hypothetical Christian Rapture\".<ref name=beam /> [[John N. Gray|John Gray]] says \"the Singularity echoes apocalyptic myths in which history is about to be interrupted by a world-transforming event\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gray|first=John|title=On the Road to Immortality|journal=The New York Review of Books|date=2011-11-24|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/nov/24/road-immortality/?pagination=false|accessdate=2013-03-19}}</ref>\n\nThe radical nature of Kurzweil's predictions is often discussed. [[Anthony Doerr]] says that before you \"dismiss it as techno-zeal\" consider that \"every day the line between what is human and what is not quite human blurs a bit more\". He lists technology of the day, in 2006, like computers that land [[Supersonic aircraft|supersonic airplanes]] or [[In vitro fertilisation|in vitro fertility treatments]] and asks whether [[brain implants]] that access the internet or robots in our blood really are that unbelievable.<ref name=doerr />\n\nIn regard to reverse engineering the brain, neuroscientist [[David Linden|David J. Linden]] writes that \"Kurzweil is conflating biological data collection with biological insight\". He feels that data collection might be growing exponentially, but insight is increasing only linearly. For example, the speed and cost of sequencing genomes is also improving exponentially, but our understanding of genetics is growing very slowly. As for nanobots Linden believes the spaces available in the brain for navigation are simply too small. He acknowledges that someday we will fully understand the brain, just not on Kurzweil's timetable.<ref>{{cite web|last=Linden|first=David|title=The Singularity is Far: A Neruoscientist's View|url=http://boingboing.net/2011/07/14/far.html|publisher=Boing Boing|accessdate=2013-02-19}}</ref>\n\n===Reviews===\n[[Paul Davies]] wrote in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' that ''The Singularity is Near'' is a \"breathless romp across the outer reaches of technological possibility\" while warning that the \"exhilarating speculation is great fun to read, but needs to be taken with a huge dose of salt.\"<ref name=\"davies\">{{cite journal|last=Davies|first=Paul|title=When computers take over|journal=Nature|date=2006-03-23|volume=440|pages=421\u2013422|url=http://www.singularity.com/When_computers_take_over.pdf|accessdate=2013-02-15|doi=10.1038/440421a }}</ref>\n\n[[Anthony Doerr]] in [[The Boston Globe]] wrote \"Kurzweil's book is surprisingly elaborate, smart, and persuasive.

Inspired by the book, Ptolemy directed and produced the film ''[[Transcendent Man]]'', which went on to bring more attention to the book.\n\nKurzweil also directed his own film adaptation, produced in partnership with [[Terasem Movement|Terasem]]; ''The Singularity is Near'' mixes documentary interviews with a science-fiction story involving his robotic avatar Ramona's transformation into an [[artificial general intelligence]]. Screened at the [[World Film Festival]], the [[Woodstock Film Festival]], the [[Warsaw International FilmFest]], the [[San Antonio Film Festival]] in 2010 and the [[San Francisco Indie Film Festival]] in 2011, the movie was released generally on July 20, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Release dates for The Singularity Is Near|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1049412/releaseinfo|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=2013-02-14}}</ref> It is available on DVD or digital download.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://store.singularity.com/|title=The Singularity Is Near, The Movie}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://singularity.com/themovie/ |title=''Singularity Is Near'' movie trailer}}</ref>\n\nThe 2014 film ''[[Lucy (2014 film)|Lucy]]'' is roughly based upon the predictions made by Kurzweil about what the year 2045 will look like, including the immortality of man.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://beginningandend.com/the-lucy-film-transhumanisms-false-promise-to-become-a-god/|title=The Lucy Film: Transhumanism's False Promise To Become A God - Beginning And End|work=Beginning And End}}</ref>\n\n==Translations==\n* [[:zh:\u5947\u9ede\u8feb\u8fd1|\u5947\u70b9\u8feb\u8fd1]] [\u5947\u70b9\u4e34\u8fd1] Translator: Zhenhua Dong\n* Dutch: De singulariteit is nabij\n* French: L'humanit\u00e9 2.0\n* Hungarian: A szingularit\u00e1s k\u00fcsz\u00f6b\u00e9n\n* Italian: La singolarit\u00e0 \u00e8 vicina\n* Korean: \ud2b9\uc774\uc810\uc774 \uc628\ub2e4\n* Spanish: La Singularidad est\u00e1 cerca\n* German: Menschheit 2.0\n* Polish: Nadchodzi Osobliwo\u015b\u0107\n* Hebrew:  Kineret \u05d4\u05e1\u05d9\u05e0\u05d2\u05d5\u05dc\u05e8\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea \u05de\u05ea\u05e7\u05e8\u05d1\u05ea 2012\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Limits to computation]]\n* [[Paradigm shift]]\n* [[Simulated reality]]\n* [[Singularitarianism]]\n* [[Technological singularity]]\n<!-- * [[Timeline of the future in forecasts]] -->\n* [[Transcendent Man]]\n* [[Transhumanism]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|last=Kurzweil|first=Ray|title=The Singularity is Near|year=2005|publisher=Viking Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-670-03384-3|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/singularityisnea00kurz}} [http://hfg-resources.googlecode.com/files/SingularityIsNear.pdf PDF]\n* {{cite web|last=Vinge|first=Vernor|title=Vernor Vinge on the Singularity|url=http://mindstalk.net/vinge/vinge-sing.html|publisher=San Diego State University|date=1993|accessdate=11 April 2013}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.singularity.com Singularity.com, Official Site for the Book]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110728121511/http://www.viceland.com/int/v16n4/htdocs/ray-kurzweil-800.php ''Vice'' Magazine interview with Ray Kurzweil] - Link down, 5/11/15\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cc5gIj3jz44 Documentary- ''The Singularity of Ray Kurzweil'' on YouTube]\n* [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB112811088248757062 ''Wall Street Journal'' review by Glenn Harlan Reynolds]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121120071541/http://www.johnhorgan.org/brain_chips_and_other_dreams_of_the_cyber_evangelists_43702.htm ''Brain Chips and Other Dreams of the Cyber-Evangelists'' by John Horgan]\n* {{IMDb title|1049412}}\n* [https://spectrum.ieee.org/singularity ''IEEE Spectrum special report on the Singularity'']\n* [http://www.ted.com/talks/aubrey_de_grey_says_we_can_avoid_aging.html Aubrey de Gray: A roadmap to end aging]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Singularity Is Near}}\n[[Category:Books by Ray Kurzweil]]\n[[Category:2005 non-fiction books]]\n[[Category:Futurology books]]\n[[Category:Singularitarianism]]\n[[Category:Transhumanist books]]\n[[Category:Futurology documentaries]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eComputational capacity:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Singularity_Is_Near"}
