{"title_page": "Howard Ellis", "text_new": "{{about||the economist|Howard S. Ellis|the New Zealand public servant and cricketer|Howard Ellis (public servant)}}\n{{infobox person/wikidata|fetchwikidata=ALL}}\n'''Howard Ellis''' (1892\u20131968){{fact|date=July 2019}} was a prominent [[Chicago]] [[lawyer]] and one of the name partners of [[Kirkland & Ellis]].\n\n==Biography==\n\nHoward Ellis was born in [[Washington Court House, Ohio]] on January 15, 1892.  He was educated at the [[University of Chicago]], receiving an [[LL.B.]] in 1914 and an [[LL.D.]] in 1915.  He was [[admitted to the bar]] in 1915.\n\nAfter law school, Ellis was hired by [[Weymouth Kirkland]] and, with Kirkland, joined the [[Chicago]] [[law firm]] of McCormick, Kirkland, Patterson & Fleming, the predecessor firm of [[Kirkland & Ellis]].  Eager to participate in [[World War I]], in 1918, Ellis volunteered to serve in the [[United States Army]] but was rejected for physical deficiencies.  He therefore went to [[France]] in April 1918 and served in the [[French Foreign Legion]] for the remainder of the war.  After the war, Ellis returned to McCormick, Kirkland, Patterson & Fleming.  There, Ellis became a close associate of [[Weymouth Kirkland]] and participated in some of Kirkland's most famous cases.\n\nIn 1919, Kirkland and Ellis defended [[Robert R. McCormick]] and the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' in a [[libel]] suit brought by [[Henry Ford]].  The ''Tribune'' had run an editorial in which it called Ford an [[anarchist]] for saying that any of his workers who volunteered to serve in the [[National Guard of the United States]] (which was then mobilized on the U.S. - [[Mexico]] border to prevent the [[Mexican Revolution]] from spilling into the United States) would be fired.  At the three-month trial, Kirkland and Ellis argued that the ''Tribune'''s editorializing was [[fair comment]].  Ford ultimately prevailed in the case, but the [[jury]] awarded Ford only six cents in damages and six cents for costs.  McCormick and the ''Tribune'' refused to pay the twelve cents, and Ford ultimately collected nothing.\n\nKirkland and Ellis again represented the ''Tribune'' when [[Mayor of Chicago]] [[William Hale Thompson]] brought a series of libel actions against the ''Tribune''.\n\nKirkland and Ellis would win a major battle for freedom of the press in the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] with ''[[Near v. Minnesota]]'', 283 U.S. 697 (1931).  In that case, a Minnesota trial judge had declared a small Minnesota newspaper to be a public nuisance and permanently enjoined the newspaper from publishing because it had adversely criticized certain local politicians in violation of an injunction.  When McCormick, who was then Chairman of the [[American Newspaper Publishers Association]]'s Committee on Free Speech, found out about the case, he persuaded the American Newspaper Publishers Association to intervene in the case, with Kirkland serving as their lawyer.  Kirkland lost the case in the [[Minnesota Supreme Court]] but later convinced the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] to declare that [[censorship]] was unconstitutional.\n\nEllis later represented the ''Tribune'' when [[antitrust]] charges were brought against the [[Associated Press]].  Ellis ultimately argued this case successfully in the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nDuring the largest antitrust case in history at the time - that involving [[DuPont]] - Ellis represented the [[Du Pont family]].

He was educated at the [[University of Chicago]], receiving an [[LL.B.]] in 1914 and an [[LL.D.]] in 1915.  He was [[admitted to the bar]] in 1915.\n\nAfter law school, Ellis was hired by [[Weymouth Kirkland]] and, with Kirkland, joined the [[Chicago]] [[law firm]] of McCormick, Kirkland, Patterson & Fleming, the predecessor firm of [[Kirkland & Ellis]].  Eager to participate in [[World War I]], in 1918, Ellis volunteered to serve in the [[United States Army]] but was rejected for physical deficiencies.  He therefore went to [[France]] in April 1918 and served in the [[French Foreign Legion]] for the remainder of the war.  After the war, Ellis returned to McCormick, Kirkland, Patterson & Fleming.  There, Ellis became a close associate of [[Weymouth Kirkland]] and participated in some of Kirkland's most famous cases.\n\nIn 1919, Kirkland and Ellis defended [[Robert R. McCormick]] and the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' in a [[libel]] suit brought by [[Henry Ford]].  The ''Tribune'' had run an editorial in which it called Ford an [[anarchist]] for saying that any of his workers who volunteered to serve in the [[National Guard of the United States]] (which was then mobilized on the U.S. - [[Mexico]] border to prevent the [[Mexican Revolution]] from spilling into the United States) would be fired.  At the three-month trial, Kirkland and Ellis argued that the ''Tribune'''s editorializing was [[fair comment]].  Ford ultimately prevailed in the case, but the [[jury]] awarded Ford only six cents in damages and six cents for costs.  McCormick and the ''Tribune'' refused to pay the twelve cents, and Ford ultimately collected nothing.\n\nKirkland and Ellis again represented the ''Tribune'' when [[Mayor of Chicago]] [[William Hale Thompson]] brought a series of libel actions against the ''Tribune''.\n\nKirkland and Ellis would win a major battle for freedom of the press in the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] with ''[[Near v. Minnesota]]'', 283 U.S. 697 (1931).  In that case, a Minnesota trial judge had declared a small Minnesota newspaper to be a public nuisance and permanently enjoined the newspaper from publishing because it had adversely criticized certain local politicians in violation of an injunction.  When McCormick, who was then Chairman of the [[American Newspaper Publishers Association]]'s Committee on Free Speech, found out about the case, he persuaded the American Newspaper Publishers Association to intervene in the case, with Kirkland serving as their lawyer.  Kirkland lost the case in the [[Minnesota Supreme Court]] but later convinced the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] to declare that [[censorship]] was unconstitutional.\n\nEllis later represented the ''Tribune'' when [[antitrust]] charges were brought against the [[Associated Press]].  Ellis ultimately argued this case successfully in the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nDuring the largest antitrust case in history at the time - that involving [[DuPont]] - Ellis represented the [[Du Pont family]].  (The government was attempting to force the Du Ponts to dispose of their stock holdings in [[General Motors]] and the [[United States Rubber Company]].)\n\nAfter the death of Weymouth Kirkland in 1965, Ellis served as managing partner of the firm, which by then was known as Kirkland, Ellis, Hodson, Chaffetz, and Masters.\n\nEllis died in his sleep on February 18, 1968.  He was 76 years old.  He was survived by his wife, the former Maude Martin Evers; the couple did not have any children.\n\n==Further reading==\n*\"Howard Ellis, Attorney, Dies: Fought for Freedom of the Press\", ''Chicago Tribune'', Feb. 19, 1968\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ellis, Howard}}\n[[Category:1892 births]]\n[[Category:1968 deaths]]\n[[Category:Illinois lawyers]]\n[[Category:Soldiers of the French Foreign Legion]]\n[[Category:University of Chicago Law School alumni]]\n[[Category:People from Washington Court House, Ohio]]\n[[Category:Kirkland & Ellis alumni]]\n", "name_user": "Nihiltres", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Simplified hatnote syntax", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Ellis"}

Grettton & A. Steven, ''Property, Trusts and Succession'' 2nd edn. (London, 2016), page 5. </ref> Most individuals will have one patrimony, but in the case of a [[trustee]], an individual may have two separate patrimonies.<ref>G. Grettton & A. Steven, ''Property, Trusts and Succession''2nd edn. (London, 2016), page 5.</ref> An important distinction must be made when regard is made to a patrimony's rights, the distinction between personal and real rights. \n\n=== Personal Rights and Real Rights ===\nScots law follows the [[Roman law]] classification of rights falling into either of two categories:  a ''jus in personam'' or a ''jus in rem'', which the works of Barry Nicholas describes as: \n\n\"Any claim is either i''n rem'' or ''in personam'', and there is an unbridgeable division between them. '''An action ''in rem'' asserts a relationship between a person and a thing, an action ''in personam'' a relationship between persons'''. The Romans think in terms of actions not of rights, but in substance one action asserts a right over a thing, the other a right against a person, and hence comes the modern dichotomy between rights ''in rem'' and rights ''in personam.'' Obviously there cannot be a dispute between a person and a thing, and therefore even in an action ''in rem'' there must be a defendant, but he is there not because he is alleged to be under any duty to the plaintiff but because by some act he is denying the alleged right of the plaintiff.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Nicholas|first=Barry|title=An Introduction to Roman Law|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1962|isbn=9780198760634|location=London|pages=100}}</ref> \n\nIn Scots law, a personal right typically is created in [[contract|contractual agreements]] (eg: a contract for sale, a contract of loan, a contract of hire, etc.) or as a result of the defender committing a [[Delict (Scots law)|delict]] (eg: breach of a duty of care), with the result is the pursuer (in other jurisdictions this is termed the ''[[plaintiff]]'' or ''[[Plaintiff|claimant]]'') brings to a Scottish court an action against an individual. A real right is held in the property itself and is enforceable against the world, a pursuer can sue in relation to a real right where the defender interferes with the pursuer's real right.<ref>''Burnett's Trustees v Grainger'' [2004] UKHL 8, per Lord Rodger of Earlsferry at para 87.</ref> Accordingly, within Scots Private law, personal rights belong to the '''[[law of obligations]]''' whereas '''real rights fall within the law of property'''.<ref>See Scotland Act 1998 s.126(4).</ref>\n\n=== The ''Numerus Clausus''===\nScots law only recognises a defined number of real rights, which follows the legal principle shared with other jurisdictions,<ref>For a comparative discussion, see B.

This means that where an individual contracts to purchase property from another, they only hold a contractual right to the property not a right ''in rem.'' The principle of ''[[Numerus clausus (law)|numerus clausus]]'' is explained in a Australian context by Edgeworth as: \n\n\"In essence, the principle holds that landowners are not at liberty to customise land rights, in the sense of reworking them in an entirely novel way to suit their particular individual needs and circumstances. Rather, <u>any new rights must fit within firmly established pigeonholes, of which the law permits only a small and finite number.</u> The principle applies regardless of the terms of any agreement that parties might reach for the purpose of creating such an interest, so it is irrelevant that a specific contractual arrangement to create a wholly novel interest might be free and\n\nfair.\"<ref>B.

This creates classes of property with different respective legal rules governing each class of property. There are two distinctions that are made in Scots law: \n\n# The distinction between corporeal and incorporeal property.  \n# The distinction between moveable and heritable property.  \n\n=== Distinction between Corporeal and Incorporeal Property ===\nThis distinction existed in Roman law,<ref>Justinian ''Institutes'' II,2,1\u20133</ref> it divides property (things) between:  \n\n'''1)''' Property which can be seen physically (''corpus'') '''corporeal property,''' (eg: a house, a piece of land, a car, a chair, etc.)''';''' and  \n\n'''2)''' Property which cannot be seen physically is known as '''incorporeal''' property (eg: a right to payment under a contract, a lease in a house, a right in [[delict]] for payment for damages, [[copyright]], etc.). \n\n=== Distinction between Heritable (Immoveable) and Moveable Property ===\nThis distinction separates property between: \n\n'''1) Heritable (also termed 'immoveable'),''' which is land and the buildings and structures upon it;<ref>Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012, s.113.\n\n\"\u201cland\u201d includes\u2014\n\n(a) buildings and other structures,\n\n(b) the seabed of the territorial sea of the United Kingdom adjacent to Scotland (including land within the ebb and flow of the tide at ordinary spring tides), and\n\n(c) other land covered with water,\"</ref> and  \n\n'''2) Moveable''' property is property which can be physically moved.  Bell, the institutional writer, defines moveables as: \"''Whatever moves, or is capable of being moved from place to place without injury or change of nature in itself, or in the subject with which it is connected, is moveable''\"<ref>Bell, ''Principles of the Law of Scotland'', 10th edn., (1899), 1472. </ref> \n\nThe distinction between moveable and immoveable (heritable) can be difficult when dealing with corporeal property, such as where corporeal moveable property (eg: a factory machine, shelves, fixtures & fittings, etc.) has been affixed to the land around it (which is heritable property). In this situation, the law of [[Accession (property law)|accession]] must apply to determine whether the moveable property has acceeded to (ie: become part of) the heritable property (land). The distinction between heritable and moveable property is also important in relation to [[Diligence (Scots law)|Scots insolvency and diligence law]] and [[Intestacy|succession and inheritance law]] in Scotland, as different rules apply to each class. \n\nAll property belongs to one of each distinction, resulting in four classes of property in Scots law, each with their own specific rules, these are:\n\n*[[Corporeal heritable property in Scots law|Corporeal heritable property]] (eg: land, building, apartment etc)\n*[[Incorporeal heritable property in Scots law|Incorporeal heritable property]] (eg: a lease, a right in a contract for sale of a house, a liferent etc.)\n*[[Corporeal moveable property in Scots law|Corporeal moveable property]] (eg: furniture, car, books, etc.)\n*[[Incorporeal moveable property]] (eg: intellectual property rights, rights of payment arising from contract or delict, etc.)\n\n== Other Legal Rules Relating to Property in Scotland ==\n\n===Feudal law===\n[[Feudalism]] had been the system of land ownership in Scots law for 800 years from the [[Davidian Revolution]] until the commencement of the Abolition of Feudal Tenure (Scotland) Act 2000.<ref>{{Cite news|last=BBC News|first=|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4048529.stm|title=Age-old Scots property rights end|date=Sunday, 28 November, 2004|work=BBC News Scotland|access-date=12/04/2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==== '''Operation of the Feudal System''' ====\nThe feudal system operated by vesting the ownership of all land in Scotland in the [[Crown Estate Scotland|Crown]] (ie: The King/Queen). The Crown could make feudal grants of land vesting ownership in a Crown vassal. Vassals had obligations to their superiors, known as [[wiktionary:reddendo|re''ddendo'']] and typically were monetary in nature such as the ''[[feu duty]].'' Historically vassals could be called upon for military service, such as the ''wardholding'' until its abolishment after the [[Jacobite risings|Jacobite revolution]].<ref>I. Duffus, Archivist of The Nine Incorporated Trades of Dundee, http://ninetradesofdundee.co.uk/download/scottish_history/scottish_history_documents_and_pictures/history/Land%20Ownership.pdf</ref> Over time the most common form of feudal grants became the ''feufarm'' which carried with an obligation pay a ''feuduty''.<ref>I. Duffus, Archivist of The Nine Incorporated Trades of Dundee, <nowiki>http://ninetradesofdundee.co.uk/download/scottish_history/scottish_history_documents_and_pictures/history/Land%20Ownership.pdf</nowiki></ref> The Crown vassals, could make grants of land, such as by ''feufarm'', to sub-vassals, in a process called ''sub-infeudation'' and these sub-vassals could make further grants, through ''sub-infeudation'', to sub-sub-vassals. The sub-infeudation process could carry on indefinitely, leading to a long complex chain of ownership leading ultimately back to the Crown. Alternatively, a vassal could substitute their place with another individual in the feudal chain by a disposition.<ref>Steven, A. and Gretton, G. (2017) ''Property, Trusts and Succession,'' 503''.''</ref> \n\nThe feudal system was starkly different from the Civilian law \"bedrock\"<ref>Steven, A. and Gretton, G. (2017) ''Property, Trusts and Succession,'' 503. </ref> that Scots law had operated on before its introduction. The result was a hybrid of feudal/civilian law whereby:<blockquote>\"the granter of a feu disposition retained an interest in the property - the superiority (or ''dominium directum''). This interest gave the granter the right to enforce conditions over the property. The grantee had the right to possess the property (or ''dominium utile''), providing that they did not breach any of the conditions set by the granter.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rosdev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/2ARM/pages/58690451/Historic+Deed+Types|title=Registers of Scotland Manuals|website=rosdev.atlassian.net|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> </blockquote>One of the most important conditions in property law that a superior could make was the use of [[Real burdens in scots law|real burdens]], restrictions which were placed on the use of the land. These feudal burdens are still of limited applicability under the Title Condition (Scotland) Act 2003.\n\n====  '''Feudal Reform and Abolition''' ====\n\n\nOver the 800 years of its usage, feudal law was subject to various reforms limiting the powers of superiors and reforming the system in favour of the ''dominium utile'' as ownership of land became wider. By the late-20th century, the passage of the Conveyancing and Feudal Reform (Scotland) Act 1974 had mitigated the payments system of owners of feu to their ''[[feudal superior]]'' (dominium directum) in the form of a ''[[feu duty]].'' However, ''a''round 10% of landowners in Scotland still had to make ''feu duty'' payments by 1999.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/381941.stm|title=BBC News {{!}} UK Politics {{!}} Feudal system faces axe|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> This enabled organisations such as the [[Church of Scotland]], who historically were feudal superiors of large tracts of land, were able to receive ''feu duty'' revenue amounting to \u00a330,000 a year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4048529.stm|title=Age-old Scots property rights end|date=2004-11-28|access-date=2020-04-12|language=en-GB}}</ref> With feudalism deemed \"outdated and archaic\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/381941.stm|title=BBC News {{!}} UK Politics {{!}} Feudal system faces axe|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> by the new [[Scottish Government|Scottish Executive]], a major package of land reform (the [[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000]], the [[Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003]] and the [[Tenements (Scotland) Act 2004]]) was passed by the Scottish Parliament which eliminated the feudal system.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4048529.stm|title=Age-old Scots property rights end|date=28 November 2004|newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]}}</ref> Section 1 of the 2000 Act is unequivocal:<blockquote>\"The feudal system of land tenure, that is to say the entire system whereby land is held by a vassal on perpetual tenure from a superior is, on the appointed day, abolished.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2000/5/section/1/data.htm|title=Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000|last=Participation|first=Expert|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> </blockquote>The 2000 Act provided that all vassals (termed the ''dominium utile'') would convert into full ownership on the appointed day,<ref>Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000, s.2(1).</ref> and that any other feudal estate (such as superiorities or ''dominium directum)'' in Scotland would cease to exist.<ref>Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000, s.2(2)</ref> The appointed day was 28 November 2004,<ref>Scottish Government, ''Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 guidance,'' https://www2.gov.scot/Topics/Justice/law/17975/Abolition</ref> on this date feudalism in Scotland ended . \n\n===Udal Law===\nThe [[Northern Isles]] became part of Scotland as a result of a pledge made by [[Christian I of Denmark|Christian I]] to [[James III of Scotland]] in exchange for the marriage of [[Margaret of Denmark, Queen of Scotland|Margaret]], Christian I's daughter to James III.<ref>B.Crawford, 'The Pawning of Orkney and Shetland' (1969) ''Scottish Historical Review'' 35\u201353, Appendix.<br /></ref> However, as part of Norway, the Northern Isles had used [[Udal Law]], which is based on the Magnus Code (also known as the ''Gulathing'' law) of 1274.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Magnus-VI|title=Magnus VI {{!}} king of Norway|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>  Scandanavian legal systems never adopted feudalism and such have a starkly different property regime to Scots law that is shared with Udal law.<ref>G.

However, large areas of Scots property law still remain governed by pre-existing legal authority predating the creation of the Scottish Parliament on 12 May 1999, so its '''current''' [[sources of law]] include: \n\n* The works of the [[Scots law#Academic writings|Institutional Writers]].\n*[[Common law]] decisions of the Scottish courts, including [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|judgments of the House of Lords]] (and its successor, the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]]), in civil appeals from the Court of Session.\n*[[List of Acts of the Parliament of Scotland to 1707|Acts of the Parliament of the Kingdom of Scotland]].\n*[[Act of Parliament (UK)|Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain, latterly Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom]].\n*[[Act of the Scottish Parliament|Acts of the Scottish Parliament.]]\n\n== Recognised Property Rights in Scots Law ==\n\n==='''Patrimony'''  ===\nIndividuals (both human and [[Legal person|juristic]]) have a patrimony, also known as 'estate', containing all the individual's rights with an economic value and all their liabilities.<ref>G. Grettton & A. Steven, ''Property, Trusts and Succession'' 2nd edn. (London, 2016), page 5. </ref> Most individuals will have one patrimony, but in the case of a [[trustee]], an individual may have two separate patrimonies.<ref>G. Grettton & A. Steven, ''Property, Trusts and Succession''2nd edn. (London, 2016), page 5.</ref> An important distinction must be made when regard is made to a patrimony's rights, the distinction between personal and real rights. \n\n=== Personal Rights and Real Rights ===\nScots law follows the [[Roman law]] classification of rights falling into either of two categories:  a ''jus in personam'' or a ''jus in rem'', which the works of Barry Nicholas describes as: \n\n\"Any claim is either i''n rem'' or ''in personam'', and there is an unbridgeable division between them. '''An action ''in rem'' asserts a relationship between a person and a thing, an action ''in personam'' a relationship between persons'''. The Romans think in terms of actions not of rights, but in substance one action asserts a right over a thing, the other a right against a person, and hence comes the modern dichotomy between rights ''in rem'' and rights ''in personam.'' Obviously there cannot be a dispute between a person and a thing, and therefore even in an action ''in rem'' there must be a defendant, but he is there not because he is alleged to be under any duty to the plaintiff but because by some act he is denying the alleged right of the plaintiff.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Nicholas|first=Barry|title=An Introduction to Roman Law|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1962|isbn=9780198760634|location=London|pages=100}}</ref> \n\nIn Scots law, a personal right typically is created in [[contract|contractual agreements]] (eg: a contract for sale, a contract of loan, a contract of hire, etc.) or as a result of the defender committing a [[Delict (Scots law)|delict]] (eg: breach of a duty of care), with the result is the pursuer (in other jurisdictions this is termed the ''[[plaintiff]]'' or ''[[Plaintiff|claimant]]'') brings to a Scottish court an action against an individual. A real right is held in the property itself and is enforceable against the world, a pursuer can sue in relation to a real right where the defender interferes with the pursuer's real right.<ref>''Burnett's Trustees v Grainger'' [2004] UKHL 8, per Lord Rodger of Earlsferry at para 87.</ref> Accordingly, within Scots Private law, personal rights belong to the '''[[law of obligations]]''' whereas '''real rights fall within the law of property'''.<ref>See Scotland Act 1998 s.126(4).</ref>\n\n=== The ''Numerus Clausus''===\nScots law only recognises a defined number of real rights, which follows the legal principle shared with other jurisdictions,<ref>For a comparative discussion, see B. Akkermans, ''The Principle of Numerus Clausus in European Property Law'' (Intersentia, 2008) vol 75, 75.</ref> that only real rights within the ''numerus clausus'' (closed number) are competent.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Swadling|first=William|date=2000|title='Opening the numerus clausus'|url=|journal=Law Quarterly Review|volume=116|pages=354|via=}}</ref> Without the valid creation of a recognised real right, an individual only holds a personal right against another. This means that where an individual contracts to purchase property from another, they only hold a contractual right to the property not a right ''in rem.'' The principle of ''[[Numerus clausus (law)|numerus clausus]]'' is explained in a Australian context by Edgeworth as: \n\n\"In essence, the principle holds that landowners are not at liberty to customise land rights, in the sense of reworking them in an entirely novel way to suit their particular individual needs and circumstances. Rather, <u>any new rights must fit within firmly established pigeonholes, of which the law permits only a small and finite number.</u> The principle applies regardless of the terms of any agreement that parties might reach for the purpose of creating such an interest, so it is irrelevant that a specific contractual arrangement to create a wholly novel interest might be free and\n\nfair.\"<ref>B. Edgeworth, 'The Numerus Clausus Principle in Contemporary Australian Property Law' (2006) 32 Monash U L Rev 387, 387.</ref> \n\nIn Scots property law, the real rights falling within the ''numerus clausus'' have never been formally codified, but it is considered that the primary real right is [[Ownership in Scots Law|ownership]] and subordinate to ownership are the lesser real rights<ref>''Erskine'' II,1,1, 'inferior real rights'.

This creates classes of property with different respective legal rules governing each class of property. There are two distinctions that are made in Scots law: \n\n# The distinction between corporeal and incorporeal property.  \n# The distinction between moveable and heritable property.  \n\n=== Distinction between Corporeal and Incorporeal Property ===\nThis distinction existed in Roman law,<ref>Justinian ''Institutes'' II,2,1\u20133</ref> it divides property (things) between:  \n\n'''1)''' Property which can be seen physically (''corpus'') '''corporeal property,''' (eg: a house, a piece of land, a car, a chair, etc.)''';''' and  \n\n'''2)''' Property which cannot be seen physically is known as '''incorporeal''' property (eg: a right to payment under a contract, a lease in a house, a right in [[delict]] for payment for damages, [[copyright]], etc.). \n\n=== Distinction between Heritable (Immoveable) and Moveable Property ===\nThis distinction separates property between: \n\n'''1) Heritable (also termed 'immoveable'),''' which is land and the buildings and structures upon it;<ref>Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012, s.113.\n\n\"\u201cland\u201d includes\u2014\n\n(a) buildings and other structures,\n\n(b) the seabed of the territorial sea of the United Kingdom adjacent to Scotland (including land within the ebb and flow of the tide at ordinary spring tides), and\n\n(c) other land covered with water,\"</ref> and  \n\n'''2) Moveable''' property is property which can be physically moved.  Bell, the institutional writer, defines moveables as: \"''Whatever moves, or is capable of being moved from place to place without injury or change of nature in itself, or in the subject with which it is connected, is moveable''\"<ref>Bell, ''Principles of the Law of Scotland'', 10th edn., (1899), 1472. </ref> \n\nThe distinction between moveable and immoveable (heritable) can be difficult when dealing with corporeal property, such as where corporeal moveable property (eg: a factory machine, shelves, fixtures & fittings, etc.) has been affixed to the land around it (which is heritable property). In this situation, the law of [[Accession (property law)|accession]] must apply to determine whether the moveable property has acceeded to (ie: become part of) the heritable property (land). The distinction between heritable and moveable property is also important in relation to [[Diligence (Scots law)|Scots insolvency and diligence law]] and [[Intestacy|succession and inheritance law]] in Scotland, as different rules apply to each class. \n\nAll property belongs to one of each distinction, resulting in four classes of property in Scots law, each with their own specific rules, these are:\n\n*[[Corporeal heritable property in Scots law|Corporeal heritable property]] (eg: land, building, apartment etc)\n*[[Incorporeal heritable property in Scots law|Incorporeal heritable property]] (eg: a lease, a right in a contract for sale of a house, a liferent etc.)\n*[[Corporeal moveable property in Scots law|Corporeal moveable property]] (eg: furniture, car, books, etc.)\n*[[Incorporeal moveable property]] (eg: intellectual property rights, rights of payment arising from contract or delict, etc.)\n\n== Other Legal Rules Relating to Property in Scotland ==\n\n=====Feudal law=====\n[[Feudalism]] had been the system of land ownership in Scots law for 800 years from the [[Davidian Revolution]] until the commencement of the Abolition of Feudal Tenure (Scotland) Act 2000.<ref>{{Cite news|last=BBC News|first=|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4048529.stm|title=Age-old Scots property rights end|date=Sunday, 28 November, 2004|work=BBC News Scotland|access-date=12/04/2020|url-status=live}}</ref> \n\n'''Operation of the Feudal System'''\n\nThe feudal system operated by vesting the ownership of all land in Scotland in the [[Crown Estate Scotland|Crown]] (ie: The King/Queen). The Crown could make feudal grants of land vesting ownership in a Crown vassal. Vassals had obligations to their superiors, known as [[wiktionary:reddendo|re''ddendo'']] and typically were monetary in nature such as the ''[[feu duty]].'' Historically vassals could be called upon for military service, such as the ''wardholding'' until its abolishment after the [[Jacobite risings|Jacobite revolution]].<ref>I. Duffus, Archivist of The Nine Incorporated Trades of Dundee, http://ninetradesofdundee.co.uk/download/scottish_history/scottish_history_documents_and_pictures/history/Land%20Ownership.pdf</ref> Over time the most common form of feudal grants became the ''feufarm'' which carried with an obligation pay a ''feuduty''.<ref>I. Duffus, Archivist of The Nine Incorporated Trades of Dundee, <nowiki>http://ninetradesofdundee.co.uk/download/scottish_history/scottish_history_documents_and_pictures/history/Land%20Ownership.pdf</nowiki></ref> The Crown vassals, could make grants of land, such as by ''feufarm'', to sub-vassals, in a process called ''sub-infeudation'' and these sub-vassals could make further grants, through ''sub-infeudation'', to sub-sub-vassals. The sub-infeudation process could carry on indefinitely, leading to a long complex chain of ownership leading ultimately back to the Crown. Alternatively, a vassal could substitute their place with another individual in the feudal chain by a disposition.<ref>Steven, A. and Gretton, G. (2017) ''Property, Trusts and Succession,'' 503''.''</ref> \n\nThe feudal system was starkly different from the Civilian law \"bedrock\"<ref>Steven, A. and Gretton, G. (2017) ''Property, Trusts and Succession,'' 503. </ref> that Scots law had operated on before its introduction. The result was a hybrid of feudal/civilian law whereby:<blockquote>\"the granter of a feu disposition retained an interest in the property - the superiority (or ''dominium directum''). This interest gave the granter the right to enforce conditions over the property. The grantee had the right to possess the property (or ''dominium utile''), providing that they did not breach any of the conditions set by the granter.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rosdev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/2ARM/pages/58690451/Historic+Deed+Types|title=Registers of Scotland Manuals|website=rosdev.atlassian.net|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> </blockquote>One of the most important conditions in property law that a superior could make was the use of [[Real burdens in scots law|real burdens]], restrictions which were placed on the use of the land. These feudal burdens are still of limited applicability under the Title Condition (Scotland) Act 2003.\n\n\n'''Feudal Reform and Abolition'''\n\nOver the 800 years of its usage, feudal law was subject to various reforms limiting the powers of superiors and reforming the system in favour of the ''dominium utile'' as ownership of land became wider. By the late-20th century, the passage of the Conveyancing and Feudal Reform (Scotland) Act 1974 had mitigated the payments system of owners of feu to their ''[[feudal superior]]'' (dominium directum) in the form of a ''[[feu duty]].'' However, ''a''round 10% of landowners in Scotland still had to make ''feu duty'' payments by 1999.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/381941.stm|title=BBC News {{!}} UK Politics {{!}} Feudal system faces axe|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> This enabled organisations such as the [[Church of Scotland]], who historically were feudal superiors of large tracts of land, were able to receive ''feu duty'' revenue amounting to \u00a330,000 a year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4048529.stm|title=Age-old Scots property rights end|date=2004-11-28|access-date=2020-04-12|language=en-GB}}</ref> With feudalism deemed \"outdated and archaic\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/381941.stm|title=BBC News {{!}} UK Politics {{!}} Feudal system faces axe|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> by the new [[Scottish Government|Scottish Executive]], a major package of land reform (the [[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000]], the [[Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003]] and the [[Tenements (Scotland) Act 2004]]) was passed by the Scottish Parliament which eliminated the feudal system.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4048529.stm|title=Age-old Scots property rights end|date=28 November 2004|newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]}}</ref> Section 1 of the 2000 Act is unequivocal:<blockquote>\"The feudal system of land tenure, that is to say the entire system whereby land is held by a vassal on perpetual tenure from a superior is, on the appointed day, abolished.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2000/5/section/1/data.htm|title=Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000|last=Participation|first=Expert|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> </blockquote>The 2000 Act provided that all vassals (termed the ''dominium utile'') would convert into full ownership on the appointed day,<ref>Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000, s.2(1).</ref> and that any other feudal estate (such as superiorities or ''dominium directum)'' in Scotland would cease to exist.<ref>Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000, s.2(2)</ref> The appointed day was 28 November 2004,<ref>Scottish Government, ''Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 guidance,'' https://www2.gov.scot/Topics/Justice/law/17975/Abolition</ref> on this date feudalism in Scotland ended . \n\n=====Udal Law=====\nThe [[Northern Isles]] became part of Scotland as a result of a pledge made by [[Christian I of Denmark|Christian I]] to [[James III of Scotland]] in exchange for the marriage of [[Margaret of Denmark, Queen of Scotland|Margaret]], Christian I's daughter to James III.<ref>B.Crawford, 'The Pawning of Orkney and Shetland' (1969) ''Scottish Historical Review'' 35\u201353, Appendix.<br /></ref> However, as part of Norway, the Northern Isles had used [[Udal Law]], which is based on the Magnus Code (also known as the ''Gulathing'' law) of 1274.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Magnus-VI|title=Magnus VI {{!}} king of Norway|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>  Scandanavian legal systems never adopted feudalism and such have a starkly different property regime to Scots law that is shared with Udal law.<ref>G.
