One of the runners is steerable. Originally, such craft were boats with a support structure, riding on the runners and steered with a rear blade, as with a conventional rudder. As iceboats evolved, the structure became a frame with a seat or cockpit for the iceboat sailor, resting on runners.

V<sub>A</sub> is generated by the combination of iceboat velocity (V<sub>B</sub>) and true wind velocity (V<sub>T</sub>).<ref>See page 204 of {{cite book\n |last = Bethwaite\n |first = Frank\n |title = High Performance Sailing\n |publisher = Adlard Coles Nautical\n |year = 2007\n |isbn = 978-0-7136-6704-2}}</ref>\n\n=== Attainable speeds ===\nDifferent classes of iceboat can achieve speeds, as follow. \n\n* [[International DN]]: {{Convert|55-68|mph|km/h|abbr=}}.<ref name=\"Boat_Speed\">{{Citation\n | first = Bob\n | last = Dill\n | contribution = Sailing Yacht Design for Maximum Speed\n | contribution-url = http://static1.1.sqspcdn.com/static/f/572109/24503675/1394724903587/Sailing+Yacht+Design+for+Maximum+Speed.pdf?token=5pzNaaWIFu%2F7e3pN5RiQ2e6MmmM%3D\n | title = The 16th Chesapeake Sailing Yacht Symposium\n | date = March 2003\n | pages =\n | place = Anapolis\n | publisher = SNAME\n | url = http://www.sname.org/chesapeakesailingyachtsymposiumcsys/pastpapers/16thcsys }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dill|first=Bob|date=February 2004|title=Putting Numbers on Iceboat Performance|url=https://www.nalsa.org/Articles/Cetus/Iceboat%20Sailing%20Performance-Cetus.pdf|journal=International DN Ice Yacht Racing Association Newsletter|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n* Classic iceboats and Skeeters: {{Convert|100-150|mph|km/h|abbr=}}.

He is mainly known for his conflict with [[Alfred the Great]].\n\n==Founder of the Danelaw==\nIt is not known how Guthrum consolidated his rule as king over the other Danish chieftains of the [[Danelaw]] (Danish-ruled territory of England), but by 874 he was able to wage a war against [[Wessex]] and its King, Alfred.\n\nIn 875, the Danish forces, then under Guthrum and [[Halfdan Ragnarsson]], divided, Halfdan's contingent returning north to Northumbria, while Guthrum's forces went to East Anglia, quartering themselves at [[Cambridge]] for the year.\n\nBy 876, Guthrum had acquired various parts of the kingdoms of [[Mercia]] and [[Northumbria]] and then turned his attention to acquiring Wessex, where his first confrontation with Alfred took place on the south coast. Guthrum sailed his army around [[Poole Harbour]] and linked up with another Viking army that was invading the area between the [[River Frome, Dorset|Frome]] and [[River Piddle|Piddle]] rivers which was ruled by Alfred.<ref>Collingwood, M. A. and Powell, F. Y. ''Scandinavian Britain'' (New York: Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, 1908), p. 94.</ref> According to the historian [[Asser]], Guthrum won his initial battle with Alfred, and he captured the ''[[castellum]]'' as well as the ancient square earthworks known as the Wareham, where there was a convent of nuns.\n\nAlfred successfully brokered a peace settlement, but by 877 this peace was broken as Guthrum led his army raiding further into Wessex, thus forcing Alfred to confront him in a series of skirmishes that Guthrum continued to win. At Exeter, which Guthrum had also captured, Alfred made a peace treaty, with the result that Guthrum left Wessex to winter in Gloucester.\n\n==Surprise attack==\n[[File:KENT-338E94. Early Medieval silver coin, penny of Aethelstan II Guthran. (FindID 132251).jpg|thumb|Silver penny of \u00c6thelstan]]\n\nOn Epiphany, 6 January 878, Guthrum made a surprise night-time attack on Alfred and his court at [[Chippenham]], [[Wiltshire]]. It being a Christian feast day the Saxons were presumably taken by surprise\u2014indeed it is possible that Wulfhere, the [[Ealdorman]] of Wiltshire, allowed the attack through either negligence or intent, for on Alfred's return to power later in 878 Wulfhere was stripped of his role as Ealdorman.\n\nAlfred fled the attack with a few retainers and took shelter in the marshes of Somerset, staying in the small village of [[Athelney]]. Over the next few months he built up his force and waged a guerrilla war against Guthrum from his fastness in the fens. After a few months Alfred called his loyal men to Egbert's Stone, and from there they travelled to Edington to fight the invaders.\n\n==Defeat by Alfred==\nGuthrum's hopes of conquering all of Wessex came to an end with his defeat at the hands of Alfred at the [[Battle of Edington]] in 878.  At Edington, Guthrum's entire army was routed by Alfred's and fled to their encampment where they were besieged by Alfred's [[fyrd]] for two weeks.  According to the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', Guthrum's army was able to negotiate a peace treaty known as the [[Treaty of Wedmore]].<ref name=\"chronicle\">''Anglo Saxon Chronicle'' Trans. by M. J. Swanton (New York, Routledge: 1996).</ref> The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' recorded the event:\n\n{{quote|Then the raiding army granted him (Alfred) hostages and great oaths that they would leave his kingdom and also promised him that their king (Guthrum) would receive baptism; and they fulfilled it. And three weeks later the king Guthrum came to him, one of thirty of the most honourable men who were in the raiding army, at [[Aller, Somerset|Aller]] \u2013 and that is near [[Athelney]] \u2013 and the king received him at [[baptism]]; and his [[chrism]] loosing was at [[Wedmore]].<ref name=\"chronicle\" />}}\n\n===Conversion to Christianity and peace===\n[[File:A Chronicle of England - Page 052 - Baptism of King Guthorm.jpg|thumb|A Victorian representation of Guthrum's baptism.]]\nUnder the [[Treaty of Wedmore]], the borders dividing the lands of Alfred and Guthrum were established,<ref>Davis, R. H. C. ''From Alfred the Great to Stephen'' (London, The Hambledon Press: 1991) p. 48.</ref> Guthrum converted to Christianity, and he took on the Christian name \u00c6thelstan with Alfred as his godfather.\n\nGuthrum upheld his end of the treaty and left the boundary that separated the Danelaw from English England unmolested. Guthrum, although failing to conquer Wessex, turned towards the lands to the east that the treaty had allotted under his control. Guthrum withdrew his army from the western borders facing Alfred's territory and moved eastward before eventually settling in the Kingdom of Guthrum in [[Kingdom of the East Angles|East Anglia]] in 879.

He is mainly known for his conflict with [[Alfred the Great]].\n\n==Founder of the Danelaw==\nIt is not known how Guthrum consolidated his rule as king over the other Danish chieftains of the [[Danelaw]] (Danish-ruled territory of England), but by 874 he was able to wage a war against [[Wessex]] and its King, Alfred.\n\nIn 875, the Danish forces, then under Guthrum and [[Halfdan Ragnarsson]], divided, Halfdan's contingent returning north to Northumbria, while Guthrum's forces went to East Anglia, quartering themselves at [[Cambridge]] for the year.\n\nBy 876, Guthrum had acquired various parts of the kingdoms of [[Mercia]] and [[Northumbria]] and then turned his attention to acquiring Wessex, where his first confrontation with Alfred took place on the south coast. Guthrum sailed his army around [[Poole Harbour]] and linked up with another Viking army that was invading the area between the [[River Frome, Dorset|Frome]] and [[River Piddle|Piddle]] rivers which was ruled by Alfred.<ref>Collingwood, M. A. and Powell, F. Y. ''Scandinavian Britain'' (New York: Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, 1908), p. 94.</ref> According to the historian [[Asser]], Guthrum won his initial battle with Alfred, and he captured the ''[[castellum]]'' as well as the ancient square earthworks known as the Wareham, where there was a convent of nuns.\n\nAlfred successfully brokered a peace settlement, but by 877 this peace was broken as Guthrum led his army raiding further into Wessex, thus forcing Alfred to confront him in a series of skirmishes that Guthrum continued to win. At Exeter, which Guthrum had also captured, Alfred made a peace treaty, with the result that Guthrum left Wessex to winter in Gloucester.\n\n==Surprise attack==\n[[File:KENT-338E94. Early Medieval silver coin, penny of Aethelstan II Guthran. (FindID 132251).jpg|thumb|Silver penny of \u00c6thelstan]]\n\nOn Epiphany, 6 January 878, Guthrum made a surprise night-time attack on Alfred and his court at [[Chippenham]], [[Wiltshire]]. It being a Christian feast day the Saxons were presumably taken by surprise\u2014indeed it is possible that Wulfhere, the [[Ealdorman]] of Wiltshire, allowed the attack through either negligence or intent, for on Alfred's return to power later in 878 Wulfhere was stripped of his role as Ealdorman.\n\nAlfred fled the attack with a few retainers and took shelter in the marshes of Somerset, staying in the small village of [[Athelney]]. Over the next few months he built up his force and waged a guerrilla war against Guthrum from his fastness in the fens. After a few months Alfred called his loyal men to Egbert's Stone, and from there they travelled to Edington to fight the invaders.\n\n==Defeat by Alfred==\nGuthrum's hopes of conquering all of Wessex came to an end with his defeat at the hands of Alfred at the [[Battle of Edington]] in 878.  At Edington, Guthrum's entire army was routed by Alfred's and fled to their encampment where they were besieged by Alfred's [[fyrd]] for two weeks.  According to the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', Guthrum's army was able to negotiate a peace treaty known as the [[Treaty of Wedmore]].<ref name=\"chronicle\">''Anglo Saxon Chronicle'' Trans. by M. J. Swanton (New York, Routledge: 1996).</ref> The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' recorded the event:\n\n{{quote|Then the raiding army granted him (Alfred) hostages and great oaths that they would leave his kingdom and also promised him that their king (Guthrum) would receive baptism; and they fulfilled it. And three weeks later the king Guthrum came to him, one of thirty of the most honourable men who were in the raiding army, at [[Aller, Somerset|Aller]] \u2013 and that is near [[Athelney]] \u2013 and the king received him at [[baptism]]; and his [[chrism]] loosing was at [[Wedmore]].<ref name=\"chronicle\" />}}\n\n===Conversion to Christianity and peace===\n[[File:A Chronicle of England - Page 052 - Baptism of King Guthorm.jpg|thumb|A Victorian representation of Guthrum's baptism.]]\nUnder the [[Treaty of Wedmore]], the borders dividing the lands of Alfred and Guthrum were established,<ref>Davis, R. H. C. ''From Alfred the Great to Stephen'' (London, The Hambledon Press: 1991) p. 48.</ref> Guthrum converted to Christianity, and he took on the Christian name \u00c6thelstan with Alfred as his godfather.\n\nGuthrum upheld his end of the treaty and left the boundary that separated the Danelaw from English England unmolested. Guthrum, although failing to conquer Wessex, turned towards the lands to the east that the treaty had allotted under his control. Guthrum withdrew his army from the western borders facing Alfred's territory and moved eastward before eventually settling in the Kingdom of Guthrum in [[Kingdom of the East Angles|East Anglia]] in 879. He lived there until his death in 890. According to the ''[[Annals of St Neots]]'', a chronicle compiled in [[Bury St Edmunds]], Guthrum was buried at ''Headleage,'' which is usually identified as [[Hadleigh, Suffolk]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dumville |first1=David |last2=Lapidge |first2=Michael |title=The Annals of St Neots with Vita Prima Sancti Neoti, The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle: a Collaborative Edition |location=Cambridge |publisher= |year=1985 |isbn=978-0-85991-117-7}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nGuthrum appears in several works of fiction, including:\n\n*[[G.

It was turned into a gate in the 15th century. Though the gate was demolished in 1762, the name survives as a major street in the [[City of London]].

The street also showcases historic and contemporary office buildings.\n\n[[Moorgate station]] on the [[London Underground]] is remembered for the [[Moorgate tube crash]] of 1975.  In the incident, a train terminating at the station failed to stop and crashed into a brick wall, and 43 people were killed.  This resulted in systems being installed on the Underground which automatically stop trains at dead-ends, which have become known as [[Moorgate control]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Moorgate gate.jpg|left|thumb|An engraving showing Moorgate before it was demolished in 1762]]\nThe earliest descriptions of Moorgate date from the early 15th century, where it was described as only a [[postern]] in the [[London Wall|London city wall]]. Located between [[Bishopsgate]] and [[Cripplegate]] and leading to a [[moorland|moor]] known as [[Moorfields]], it was not one of the larger or more important of the city gates.\n\nIn 1415 an [[local ordinance|ordinance]] enacted that the old postern be demolished.  It was replaced with a newer and larger structure located farther to the west, which included a wooden [[gate]] to be shut at night.  This gate was enlarged again in 1472 and 1511, and then damaged in the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666.  Although the City gates had ceased to have any modern function apart from decoration, it was replaced along with [[Ludgate]], [[Newgate]], and [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]] with a stone gate in 1672.\n\nMoorgate was demolished with most of the other London city wall gates in 1761/2, and the resulting stone was sold for \u00a3166 to the [[City of London Corporation]] to support the [[Starling (architecture)|starlings]] of the newly widened centre arch of the [[London Bridge]].\n\nLittle Moorgate was a gate opposite [[Little Winchester Street]] leading into [[Moorfields]]. It had been demolished by 1755, but gave its name to a street <ref>Boyle, P. ''Boyle's View of London, and its Environs''; 1799. London, accessed at [http://www.londonancestor.com/boyle/str-l.htm] 2008-04-12</ref> that was later removed for the building of a railway.\n\nThe [[Moorfields]] were one of the last pieces of open land in the City of London. The fields were divided into three areas: the Moorfields proper, just inside the City boundaries, north of [[Bethlem Royal Hospital]] (also known as Bedlam, Europe's oldest [[psychiatric hospital]]), and Middle and Upper Moorfields (both also open fields) to the north. Much of Moorfields was developed in 1777 and turned into present day [[Finsbury Circus]].\n\n[[File:Rocque e1 MoorgateCrop.jpg|thumb|300px|Map of [[London Wall]], Moorgate, [[Moorfields]] and [[Bethlem Royal Hospital]] from ''[[John Rocque's Map of London, 1746|John Rocque's Map of London]]'', dated 1746]]\n\nToday, the name survives in the name of the [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] parish of [[St. Mary Moorfields]]; Moorfields the short street parallel with Moorgate; and Moorfields Highwalk, one of the pedestrian \"streets\" at high level in the [[Barbican Estate]].\n\nIn addition, the London Dispensary for curing diseases of the Eye and Ear was founded on the Moorfields in 1805, and evolved to become the present [[Moorfields Eye Hospital]], which is now located on [[City Road]] (known popularly from the second verse of the [[nursery rhyme]] ''[[Pop Goes the Weasel]]''), and is close to [[Old Street station]].\n\n==Moorgate Street and suburb==\n[[File:MoorHouse.jpg|thumb|[[Moor House]]]]\n[[File:City Point building.jpg|thumb|[[CityPoint]]]]\nThe contemporary street of Moorgate runs north from Princes Street and [[Lothbury]] at the back of the [[Bank of England]], across the road named London Wall and the location of the old gate, and then continues north. It is located inside the [[EC postcode area|EC2]] postal district. After leaving the [[City of London]] in the direction of the [[London Borough of Hackney]], the street is known as [[Finsbury Pavement]] (which at one time was known as Moor Fields Pavement) and then City Road. The street was constructed around 1846 as one of the new approaches to [[London Bridge]]. While the street was formally known as \"Moorgate Street\", the street part of the name eventually fell out of use.\n\nA new commercial development on Moorgate, known as [[Moor House]], opened in 2005. The building is located at the corner of Moorgate and London Wall, and was designed by [[Foster and Partners]]. The building has 28,000&nbsp;m\u00b2 of office space in 19 storeys, and is built in the location of a smaller office building built in the 1960s known as Moor House. A 36 m shaft under the building incorporates part of [[Crossrail]]'s new station and ticket hall serving Liverpool Street.\n\nDuring the 1940s-60s, HM Customs and Excise investigation staff were based at Moorgate Hall, 153 Moorgate.\n\nThere is a campus of the [[London Metropolitan University]], formerly a Polytechnic, and part of the [[London Guildhall University]], on Moorgate. The campus houses its business school, a [[library]], and other administrative facilities.\n\nThere is a small side street to the east off of Moorgate, known as Moorgate Place. It now connects to another side street known as Swan Alley, in turn connecting to Moorgate. The side street is the location of the Chartered Accountants' Hall, home of the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales]].\n\nThe [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]] is connected to [[Moorgate station]] via Bassishaw Highwalk. The Guildhall is the home of the [[City of London Corporation]] and the centre of City government since the [[Middle Ages]]. Adjacent and internally connected to the Guildhall is the [[Guildhall Art Gallery]], which houses the art collection of the City of London. It occupies a stone building in a semi-[[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style which was completed in 1999 to replace an earlier building destroyed in 1941.\n\nFinsbury Circus, an oval-shaped [[circus]], branches east out of Moorgate, sitting on the site of the old Bethlem Hospital and part of Moorfields. The gardens in the centre of the circus occupy a 5,000 square metre (1.2&nbsp;[[acre]]s) plot enclosed by railings, and include the immaculate lawn of the City of London Bowls Club.  Built in 1814, it is unusual amongst London's [[Town square|square]]s in being [[ellipse|elliptical]], with the [[major axis]] oriented west-east. According to the [[National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens]], the garden is [[listed building|Grade II listed]].\n\nMoorgate is also the birthplace of [[John Keats]], one of the principal [[poetry|poets]] in the [[England|English]] [[Romanticism|Romantic]] movement.  Keats was born in 1795 in the Swan and Hoop Inn at 199 Moorgate, where his father was an [[Hostler|ostler]]. The pub is now called \"The John Keats at The Globe\", having previously been known as \"The Moorgate Coffee House\", \"The Moorgate\" and \"The John Keats at Moorgate\", only a few yards from Moorgate station.\n\nThe nearest [[London Underground]] and [[National Rail]] station is [[Moorgate station|Moorgate]].\n\n==Redevelopment of the area==\nA number of large buildings are being planned or already built in the neighbouring streets. These include a 43-storey, 140 m residential skyscraper at Milton Court ([[The Heron]]), that is taller than [[CityPoint]], and a 90 m office tower at Ropemaker Place is also being developed by [[British Land]], with construction already underway.\n\n==Nearest places==\n* [[Barbican Estate]]\n\n==Nearby rail and Tube==\n;''[[National Rail]]''\n*[[Liverpool Street station]]\n*[[Moorgate station]]\n\n;''[[London Underground]]''\n*Moorgate station: [[Northern line]] (city branch), [[Circle line (London Underground)|Circle]], [[Hammersmith & City line|Hammersmith & City]] and [[Metropolitan line|Metropolitan]] lines\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n;Books and articles\n* Lange, D.

[[Sunscreen]] can protect the skin from sun damage; sunscreen should be applied at least 20 minutes before exposure, and should be re-applied every four hours. Sunscreen should be applied to all areas of the skin that will be exposed to sunlight, and at least a tablespoon (25&nbsp;ml) should be applied to each limb, the face, chest, and back, to ensure thorough coverage. Many tinted moisturizers, foundations and primers now contain some form of SPF.\n\nSunscreens may come in the form of creams, gels or lotions; their [[Sun protection factor|SPF]] number indicates their effectiveness in protecting the skin from the sun's radiation. There are sunscreens available to suit every skin type; in particular, those with oily skin should choose non-comedogenic sunscreens; those with dry skins should choose sunscreens with moisturizers to help keep skin hydrated, and those with sensitive skin should choose unscented, hypoallergenic sunscreen and spot-test in an inconspicuous place (such as the inside of the elbow or behind the ear) to ensure that it does not irritate the skin.\n\n==Elderly==\n\nSkin ageing is associated with increased vulnerability.<ref name=Kottner2013/> Skin problems including [[pruritus]] are common in the elderly but are often inadequately addressed.<ref name=Beauregard/> A literature review of studies that assessed maintenance of skin integrity in the elderly found most to be low [[levels of evidence]]<ref name=Kottner2013/> but the review concluded that skin-cleansing with synthetic [[detergent]]s or [[amphoterism|amphoteric]] [[surfactant]]s induced less skin dryness than using soap and water.<ref name=Kottner2013/> [[Moisturizer]]s with [[humectant]]s helped with skin dryness, and skin barrier occlusives reduced skin injuries.<ref name=Kottner2013/>\n\n==Acne==\n\n{{Main|Acne}}\nAccording to the American Academy of Dermatology, between 40 and 50 million Americans suffer from acne each year.<ref name=\"aad.org\">{{cite web|url=https://www.aad.org/practicecenter/quality/clinical-guidelines/acne|title=Acne clinical guideline|publisher=American Academy of Dermatology|date=2018}}</ref> While many associate acne with adolescence, acne can occur at any age, with its causes including heredity, hormones, menstruation, food, and emotional stress.<ref name=\"aad.org\"/>\n\nThose with inflammatory acne should exfoliate with caution as the procedure may make conditions worse and consult a dermatologist before treatment.<ref name=\"aad.org\"/> Some anti-acne creams contain drying agents such as [[benzoyl peroxide]] (in concentrations of 2.5 - 10% ).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=333.310|title=Topical Acne Drug Products|publisher=CFR - Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, U.S. Food and Drug Administration|date=1 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Pressure sore==\n\n{{Main|Pressure ulcer}}\n\nPressure sores are injuries to skin and underlying tissue as a result of prolonged pressure on the skin.
