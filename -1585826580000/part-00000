His formal education was limited to primary schooling due to his parents' poor economic condition.\n\nFrom the paddy fields, he strode into the field of fine arts through theatre at the age of 10.<ref>{{Cite news | url = http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/irreplaceable-icon/article5617831.ece | title = Irreplaceable icon | last = Narasimham | first = M.

His most noted roles were in some of the famous dramas of the day: ''Harishchandra'', ''Kanakatara'', ''Vipranarayana'', ''Telugu Talli'', ''Aasajyoti'' and ''Satyanveshanam''. The turning point of his career came when Ghantasala Balaramaiah, a prominent film producer at that time, discovered him by chance at the Vijayawada railway station. He was cast in the lead role of Rama in [[Seeta Rama Jananam]]. This was after his debut in a supporting role in the film ''[[Dharmapatni]]''.\n\n==Stardom==\nFrom very humble beginnings, he went on to star in over 255 films, spanning the Telugu, Tamil and Hindi languages.<ref name=eenadu1>{{cite web | title = Legendary telugu actor ANR passes away at 91 | url = http://www.eenadu.net/Homeinner.aspx?item=break31 | publisher = Eenadu | accessdate = 22 January 2014}}</ref> A majority of his films were both commercial and critical successes.<ref name=\"rediff.com\"/><ref name=\"Nagarjuna about God\"/><ref name=\"Indian Express\"/><ref name=\"Romance Is All\"/><ref name=\"GroupedRef1\">{{Cite web | url = http://www.telugufilmfun.com/celebrity_interviews/Akkineni_Nageswara_Rao_Birthday.php | title = Interview with A.

To avoid being typecast, he shifted paths by doing a surprising comic turn in ''[[Missamma]]''.\n\nAkkineni Nageswara Rao played a range of characters that very few matched. His movie, ''[[Premabhishekam (1981 film)|Premabhishekam]]'' is one of the biggest hits ever in Tollywood, with an amazing 533 days run in Hyderabad. It is still the highest theatrical run in a city for any Telugu movie.\n\nHe was the first to play multiple roles (Nine in all) in the Telugu film ''[[Navarathri]]''. ANR's portrayal of an alcoholic lover in ''[[Devadasu (1953 film)|Devadasu]]'', remains his signature role.  Although ''Devadasu'' has been made in several languages by many others (in Hindi with Dilip Kumar, and later with Shah Rukh Khan), critics unanimously{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} are of the opinion that ANR's portrayal is by far the best. Even Dilip Kumar once famously remarked that ANR's performance outshone even his own.\n\nThough he did the roles of mythological divine figures such as Rama, Krishna and many others, he was famously an agnostic.<ref>{{cite news | title = Nageswara Rao, my father was a humble human being: Son Nagarjuna | url = https://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/interview-nageswara-rao-my-father-was-a-humble-human-being-son-nagarjuna-1958114 | accessdate = 23 December 2018 | work = [[Daily News and Analysis]] | date = 29 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nHe is fondly called ''Natasamrat'' by his fans. Some of his many commercially successful films are ''[[Maya Bazaar]], Samsaram, [[Bratuku Theruvu]], [[Aradhana (1962 film)|Aradhana]], [[Donga Ramudu]], [[Dr. Chakravarthi]], [[Ardhaangi]], [[Mangalya Balam]], [[Illarikam]], [[Shantinivasam]], [[Velugu Needalu]], [[Dasara Bullodu]], [[Bharya Bhartalu]], [[Dharmadata]], [[Batasari]]'' and ''[[College Bullodu]]''. ''[[Sitaramayyagari Manavaralu]]'' was released in 1991, almost 50 years after his debut, and was a huge success at the box office, despite the influx of younger stars.\n\n==Death==\n\nOn 19 October 2013, ANR was diagnosed with stomach cancer.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/anr-struck-by-cancer-of-intestine/article5252056.ece | title = ANR Struck by Cancer of intestine | newspaper = The Hindu | date = 20 October 2013 | last1 = Krishnamoorthy | first1 = Suresh}}</ref> He continued shooting for his final film ''[[Manam (film)|Manam]]'', two weeks after a major laparoscopic surgery, which some doctors feared he wouldn't survive.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/telugu/movies/news-interviews/ANR-dubbed-for-his-film-from-his-death-bed/articleshow/29589880.cms | title = ANR dubbed for his film from his death bed | work = The Times of India}}</ref> He had often said that he wished to act till his death, and Manam proved that.

''[[Manasuloni Maata]]'' is another of his famous books.\n\n==Family==\nANR married Annapurna Kollipara on 18 February 1949. He said several times that he was indebted to her and her family for accepting the match, and that was the main reason why he named most of his enterprises after her. They had 5 children together and 11 grandchildren, most of whom are actively involved in films and in his entrepreneurships.\n\n==Charity==\nANR was very active in social service. Pointing to the sky, he once famously said, \"If there's a presence there, I'm sure he'll want us to perform our earthly duties well and be a good human being rather than blindly worship him\".<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/anr-always/article5606052.ece | title = ANR Always | newspaper = The Hindu | accessdate = 26 February 2014 | date = 22 January 2014 | last1 = Mary | first1 = S.

He strove hard to have it realised under the Janmabhoomi programme during the TDP regime. He was instrumental in the construction of the Akkineni Varadhi (a bridge named after him), which improved his village's economy by facilitating easy connectivity.

His most noted roles were in some of the famous dramas of the day: ''Harishchandra'', ''Kanakatara'', ''Vipranarayana'', ''Telugu Talli'', ''Aasajyoti'' and ''Satyanveshanam''. The turning point of his career came when Ghantasala Balaramaiah, a prominent film producer at that time, discovered him by chance at the Vijayawada railway station. He was cast in the lead role of Rama in [[Seeta Rama Jananam]]. This was after his debut in a supporting role in the film ''[[Dharmapatni]]''.\n\n==Stardom==\nFrom very humble beginnings, he went on to star in over 255 films, spanning the Telugu, Tamil and Hindi languages.<ref name=eenadu1>{{cite web | title = Legendary telugu actor ANR passes away at 91 | url = http://www.eenadu.net/Homeinner.aspx?item=break31 | publisher = Eenadu | accessdate = 22 January 2014}}</ref> A majority of his films were both commercial and critical successes.<ref name=\"rediff.com\"/><ref name=\"Nagarjuna about God\"/><ref name=\"Indian Express\"/><ref name=\"Romance Is All\"/><ref name=\"GroupedRef1\">{{Cite web | url = http://www.telugufilmfun.com/celebrity_interviews/Akkineni_Nageswara_Rao_Birthday.php | title = Interview with A.

To avoid being typecast, he shifted paths by doing a surprising comic turn in ''[[Missamma]]''.\n\nAkkineni Nageswara Rao played a range of characters that very few matched. His movie, ''[[Premabhishekam (1981 film)|Premabhishekam]]'' is one of the biggest hits ever in Tollywood, with an amazing 533 days run in Hyderabad. It is still the highest theatrical run in a city for any Telugu movie.\n\nHe was the first to play multiple roles (Nine in all) in the Telugu film ''[[Navarathri]]''. ANR's portrayal of an alcoholic lover in ''[[Devadasu (1953 film)|Devadasu]]'', remains his signature role.  Although ''Devadasu'' has been made in several languages by many others (in Hindi with Dilip Kumar, and later with Shah Rukh Khan), critics unanimously{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} are of the opinion that ANR's portrayal is by far the best. Even Dilip Kumar once famously remarked that ANR's performance outshone even his own.\n\nThough he did the roles of mythological divine figures such as Rama, Krishna and many others, he was famously an agnostic.<ref>{{cite news | title = Nageswara Rao, my father was a humble human being: Son Nagarjuna | url = https://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/interview-nageswara-rao-my-father-was-a-humble-human-being-son-nagarjuna-1958114 | accessdate = 23 December 2018 | work = [[Daily News and Analysis]] | date = 29 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nHe is fondly called ''Natasamrat'' by his fans. Some of his many commercially successful films are ''[[Maya Bazaar]], Samsaram, [[Bratuku Theruvu]], [[Aradhana (1962 film)|Aradhana]], [[Donga Ramudu]], [[Dr. Chakravarthi]], [[Ardhaangi]], [[Mangalya Balam]], [[Illarikam]], [[Shantinivasam]], [[Velugu Needalu]], [[Dasara Bullodu]], [[Bharya Bhartalu]], [[Dharmadata]], [[Batasari]]'' and ''[[College Bullodu]]''. ''[[Sitaramayyagari Manavaralu]]'' was released in 1991, almost 50 years after his debut, and was a huge success at the box office, despite the influx of younger stars.\n\n==Death==\n\nOn 19 October 2013, ANR was diagnosed with stomach cancer.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/anr-struck-by-cancer-of-intestine/article5252056.ece | title = ANR Struck by Cancer of intestine | newspaper = The Hindu | date = 20 October 2013 | last1 = Krishnamoorthy | first1 = Suresh}}</ref> He continued shooting for his final film ''[[Manam (film)|Manam]]'', two weeks after a major laparoscopic surgery, which some doctors feared he wouldn't survive.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/telugu/movies/news-interviews/ANR-dubbed-for-his-film-from-his-death-bed/articleshow/29589880.cms | title = ANR dubbed for his film from his death bed | work = The Times of India}}</ref> He had often said that he wished to act till his death, and Manam proved that.

''[[Manasuloni Maata]]'' is another of his famous books.\n\n==Family==\nANR married Annapurna Kollipara on 18 February 1949. He said several times that he was indebted to her and her family for accepting the match, and that was the main reason why he named most of his enterprises after her. They had 5 children together and 11 grandchildren, most of whom are actively involved in films and in his entrepreneurships.\n\n==Charity==\nANR was very active in social service. Pointing to the sky, he once famously said, \"If there's a presence there, I'm sure he'll want us to perform our earthly duties well and be a good human being rather than blindly worship him\".<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/anr-always/article5606052.ece | title = ANR Always | newspaper = The Hindu | accessdate = 26 February 2014 | date = 22 January 2014 | last1 = Mary | first1 = S.

He strove hard to have it realised under the Janmabhoomi programme during the TDP regime. He was instrumental in the construction of the Akkineni Varadhi (a bridge named after him), which improved his village's economy by facilitating easy connectivity.
