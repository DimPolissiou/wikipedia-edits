The Mussa Al-Kadhum Brigade consisted of ex-Iraqi-Ottoman officers, whose barracks were located in [[Kadhimyah]].{{sfn|Pollack|2002|p=149}} The United Kingdom provided support and training to the Iraqi Army and the Iraqi Air Force through a small military mission based in [[Baghdad]].<ref>Lyman, p. 25</ref> Iraqi Army Day celebrates the soldiers that fight for Iraq.\n\n===Royal Iraqi Army===\n{{Main|Kingdom of Iraq}}\nFrom 1533 to 1918, [[Ottoman Iraq|Iraq]] was under the rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]], and fought as part of the [[Military of the Ottoman Empire]]. After 1917, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] took control of the country. The first Iraqi military forces established by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] were the [[Iraq Levies]], several battalions of troops tasked to guard the [[Royal Air Force]] ([[RAF]]) bases from which the British controlled Iraq.\n\nIn August 1921, the British installed [[Hashemite]] [[King of Iraq|King]] [[Faisal I of Iraq|Faisal I]] as the client ruler of the [[Mandatory Iraq|British Mandate of Iraq]]. Faisal had been forced out as the [[King of Syria]] by the [[French Third Republic|French]]. Likewise, British authorities selected [[Sunni]] Arab elites from the region for appointments to government and ministry offices in Iraq. The British and the Iraqis formalized the relationship between the two nations with the [[Anglo-Iraqi Treaty|Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1922]]. With Faisal's ascension to the throne, the Iraqi Army became the Royal Iraqi Army (RIrA).\n\nIn 1922, the army totalled 3,618 men. This was well below the 6,000 men requested by the Iraqi monarchy and even less than the British set limit of 4,500. Unattractive salaries hindered early recruiting efforts. At this time, the United Kingdom maintained the right to levy local forces like the British-officered [[Iraq Levies]] which were under direct British control. With a strength of 4,984 men, the Iraq Levies outnumbered the army with its British set limit of 4,500 men.\n\nIn 1924, the army grew to 5,772 men and, by the following year, had grown still more to reach 7,500 men. It was to stay at 7,500 men until 1933. The force now had six infantry battalions, three cavalry regiments, two mountain regiments, and one field battery.<ref>Al-Marashi, pp. 23\u201324</ref>\n\nIn 1932, the [[Kingdom of Iraq]] was granted official independence. This was in accordance with the [[Anglo-Iraqi Treaty (1930)|Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930]], whereby the [[United Kingdom]] would end its official mandate on the condition that the Iraqi government would allow British advisers to take part in government affairs, allow British military bases to remain, and a requirement that Iraq assist the United Kingdom in wartime.<ref>Ghareeb, Edmund A.; Dougherty, Beth K. ''Historical Dictionary of Iraq''. Lanham, Maryland and Oxford: The Scarecrow Press, Ltd., 2004. Pp. lvii.</ref>\n\nUpon achieving independence in 1932, political tensions arose over the continued British presence in Iraq, with Iraq's government and politicians split between those considered pro-British and those who were considered anti-British. The pro-British faction was represented by politicians such as [[Nuri as-Said]] who did not oppose a continued British presence. The anti-British faction was represented by politicians such as [[Rashid Ali al-Gaylani]] who demanded that remaining British influence in the country be removed.<ref name=\"Ghareeb; Dougherty. Pp lvii\">Ghareeb; Dougherty. Pp lvii</ref> In 1936, General [[Bakr Sidqi]], who had won a reputation from suppressing tribal revolts, was named Chief of the General Staff and successfully pressured the King to demand that the Cabinet resign.<ref>S.E.

[[List of Prime Ministers of Iraq|Prime Minister]] [[Taha al-Hashimi]] resigned and Rashid Ali al-Gaylani took his place as Prime Minister.  Rashid Ali also proclaimed himself chief of a \"National Defence Government.\"  He did not overthrow the monarchy, but installed a more compliant [[Regent]].  He also attempted to restrict the rights of the British which were granted them under the 1930 treaty.\n\nOn April 30 Iraqi Army units took the high ground to the south of [[RAF Habbaniya]]. An Iraqi envoy was sent to demand that no movements, either ground or air, were to take place from the base. The British refused the demand and then themselves demanded that the Iraqi units leave the area at once. In addition, the British landed forces at [[Basra]] and the Iraqis demanded that these forces be removed.\n\nAt 0500 hours on 2 May 1941, the [[Anglo-Iraqi War]] broke out between the British and Rashid Ali's new government when the British at [[RAF Habbaniya]] launched [[air strikes]] against the Iraqis. By this time, the army had grown significantly. It had four infantry divisions with some 60,000 men.<ref>Playfair, I.S.O.; and others (2006).

The Iraqi [[1st Division (Iraq)|1st]] and [[3rd Division (Iraq)|3rd Divisions]] were stationed in Baghdad. Also based within Baghdad was the Independent Mechanized Brigade comprising a [[L3/35]] light tank company, an [[Crossley Motors|armoured car company]], two battalions of [[motorized infantry|\"mechanized\" infantry]] transported in trucks, a \"mechanized\" machine-gun company, and a \"mechanized\" artillery brigade. The [[2nd Division (Iraq)|2nd Division]] was stationed in [[Kirkuk]], and the 4th Division was in [[Al Diwaniyah]], on the main rail line from Baghdad to Basra. All these \"mechanized\" infantry units were transported by trucks.\n\nHostilities between the British and the Iraqis lasted from 2 May to 30 May 1941. The German government despatched an aviation unit, [[Fliegerf\u00fchrer Irak]], and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] send limited assistance, but both were too late and far from adequate. In the end, the British were able to march on [[Baghdad]] and Rashid Ali al-Gaylani fled.\n\nAfter the Anglo-Iraqi War ended, Nuri as-Said returned as Prime Minister and dominated the politics of Iraq until the overthrow of the monarchy and his assassination in 1958. Nuri as-Said pursued a largely pro-[[Western world|western policy]] during this period.<ref>Ghareeb; Dougherty. Pp lviii</ref> The army was not disbanded. Instead, it was maintained to hinder possible German offensive actions launched from southern [[RSFSR|Russia]]. British troops left in the late 1940s.\n\n=== 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War ===\nIn the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]], the Iraqis deployed an expeditionary force which peaked at 15,000\u201318,000 men.{{sfn|Pollack|2002|p=150, 156}} In 1948, the army deployed 21,000 men in twelve brigades and the [[Iraqi Air Force|Royal Iraqi Air Force]] deployed 100 planes, mostly British. Initially the Iraqis committed around 3,000<ref>D. Kurzman, ''Genesis 1948'', 1972, p. 382.</ref> men to the war effort including four infantry brigades, one armoured battalion and support personnel. These forces were to operate under Jordanian guidance<ref>I. Pappe, ''The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine'', 2006, p. 129.</ref> During the first truce the Iraqis increased their force to about 10,000.<ref>Kurzman, p. 556.</ref> Ultimately, the Iraqi expeditionary force numbered around 15,000 to 18,000 men.{{sfn|Pollack|2002|p=150}}\n\nThe first Iraqi forces to be deployed reached Jordan in April 1948 under the command of General [[Nur ad-Din Mahmud]]. On 15 May, Iraqi engineers built a [[pontoon bridge]] across the Jordan River and attacked the Israeli settlement of [[Gesher, Israel|Gesher]]. Over 3,000 Iraqi soldiers with armor and air support were unable to defeat less than 50 lightly armed Jewish defenders. Following this defeat Iraqi forces moved into the [[Nablus]]\u2013[[Jenin]]\u2013[[Tulkarm]] strategic triangle, where they suffered heavy casualties in the Israeli attack on Jenin which began on 3 June, but they managed to hold on to their positions. Active Iraqi involvement in the war effectively ended at this point.{{sfn|Pollack|2002|p=149\u2013155}}\n\nIn May 1955 the British finally withdrew from Iraq. The Iraqi authorities said during the withdrawal negotiations that a motorised infantry brigade was to be formed, based at the previous [[RAF Habbaniya]], a location that had been occupied by the British [[Iraq Levies]].<ref>Solomon (Sawa) Solomon, [http://www.edessa.com/history/solmn1.htm \"The Assyrian Levies, The Final Chapter\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722133011/http://www.edessa.com/history/solmn1.htm |date=2011-07-22 }}, ''Nineveh Magazine'' 4Q,93, V16, No4.</ref>\n\n===Republic declared===\n{{Main|Iraqi Republic (1958\u201368)}}\n\nThe [[Hashemite monarchy]] lasted until 1958, when it was overthrown through a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] by the Iraqi Army, known as the [[14 July Revolution]]. King [[Faisal II of Iraq]] along with members of the royal family were murdered. The coup brought [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]] to power. He withdrew from the [[Baghdad Pact]] and established friendly relations with the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nWhen Q\u0101sim distanced himself from [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Abd an-N\u0101sir]], he faced growing opposition from pro-Egypt officers in the Iraqi army. `Arif, who wanted closer cooperation with Egypt, was stripped of his responsibilities and thrown in prison. When the garrison in [[Mosul]] rebelled against Q\u0101sim's policies, he allowed the Kurdish leader [[Mustafa Barzani|Barz\u0101n\u012b]] to return from exile in the Soviet Union to help suppress the pro-N\u0101sir rebels.\n\nThe creation of the new Fifth Division, consisting of mechanized infantry, was announced on 6 January 1959, [[Army Day]].<ref>''[[The Times]]'', 'New Division for Iraq Army,' 7 January 1959</ref> Q\u0101sim was also promoted to the rank of general.\n\nIn 1961, an Army buildup close to [[Kuwait]] in conjunction with Iraqi claims over the small neighbouring state, led to a crisis with British military forces ([[British army|land]], [[Royal Navy|sea]], and [[Royal Air force|air]]) deployed to Kuwait for a period. In 1961, [[Kuwait]] gained independence from Britain and Iraq claimed sovereignty over Kuwait. As in the 1930s, Qasim based Iraq's claim on the assertion that Kuwait had been a district of the Ottoman province of Basra, unjustly severed by the British from the main body of Iraqi state when it had been created in the 1920s.<ref>Tripp, Charles. ''A History of Iraq''. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2002, p.165</ref> Britain reacted strongly to Iraq's claim and sent troops to Kuwait to deter Iraq. Q\u0101sim was forced to back down and in October 1963, Iraq recognized the sovereignty of Kuwait.\n\nQ\u0101sim was assassinated in February 1963, when the [[Ba'ath Party]] [[February 1963 Iraqi coup d'\u00e9tat|took power]] under the leadership of General [[Ahmed Hasan al-Bakr]] ([[Prime Minister of Iraq|prime minister]]) and Colonel [[Abdul Salam Arif]] ([[President of Iraq|president]]). Nine months later `Abd as-Salam Muhammad `Arif led a successful coup against the Ba'ath government. On 13 April 1966, President Abdul Salam Arif died in a helicopter crash and was succeeded by his brother, General [[Abdul Rahman Arif]]. Following the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967, the Ba'ath Party felt strong enough to retake power (17 July 1968). Ahmad Hasan al-Bakr became president and chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC).\n\n===Six-Day War===\n[[File:Iraqi AML-60-20.jpg|thumb|Iraqi Army [[Panhard AML|Panhard AML-60]] armored car, 1970s. Iraq ordered about 250 of these vehicles between 1968 and 1976.]]\nDuring the Six-Day War, the Iraqi [[3rd Division (Iraq)|3rd Armoured Division]] was deployed in eastern Jordan.<ref>Pollack, 2002, p.167</ref> However, the Israeli attack against the West Bank unfolded so quickly that the Iraqi force could not organise itself and reach the front before Jordan ceased fighting. Repeated Israeli airstrikes also held them up so that by the time they did reach the [[Jordan River]] the entire [[West Bank]] was in Israeli hands. During the course of the [[Jordanian campaign (1967)|Jordanian Campaign]] ten Iraqis were killed and 30 Iraqis were wounded, especially as the main battle was in Jerusalem. Fighting also raged in other areas of the West Bank, where Iraqi commandos and Jordanian soldiers defended their positions.<ref>Follow me- The story of the Six Day War 2. Six Day War- Tom Segev</ref>\n\nBarz\u0101n\u012b and the Kurds who had begun a rebellion in 1961 were still causing problems in 1969. The secretary-general of the Ba`th party, [[Saddam Hussein]], was given responsibility to find a solution. It was clear that it was impossible to defeat the Kurds by military means and in 1970 a political agreement was reached between the rebels and the Iraqi government.\n\nFollowing the Arab defeat in 1967, Jordan became a hotbed of Palestinian activity. During this time PLO elements attempted to create a Palestinian state within Jordan caused the Jordanians to launch their full military force against the PLO. As they were doing this Syria invaded Jordan and Iraq moved a brigade in Rihab, Jordan.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Otherwise the only Iraqi activity was that they fired upon some Jordanian aircraft.\n\nIraq sent a 60,000 man expeditionary force to the Syrian front during the [[Yom Kippur War]]. It consisted of the 3rd and [[6th Division (Iraq)|6th Armoured Divisions]], two infantry brigades, twelve artillery battalions, and a special forces brigade. The two armoured divisions were, Pollack says, 'unquestionably the best formations of the Iraqi Army.'(Pollack p.&nbsp;167) Yet during their operations on the Golan Heights, their performance was awful in virtually every category of military effectiveness. Military intelligence, initiative, and small unit independent action was virtually absent.<ref>Pollack p.173-5, citing among others Tzvi Ofer, 'The Iraqi Army in the Yom Kippur War,' transl. 'Hatzav,' Tel Aviv: Ma'arachot, 1986, p.128-65. Pollack notes that the various accounts of Iraqi operations on the Golan Heights are highly contradictory. He relies on Ofer, 1986, which is an Israeli General Staff critique of the official Iraqi General Staff analysis of the battle.</ref>\n\nAfter the war, Iraq started a major military build-up. Active duty manpower doubled, and so did number of divisions, from six to twelve, of which four were now armoured and two mechanised infantry. (Pollack p.&nbsp;182)\n\n===Iran\u2013Iraq war===\n{{see also|Order of battle during the Iran\u2013Iraq War}}\nLater, Saddam Hussein, looking to build fighting power against Iran soon after the outbreak of the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] doubled the size of the Iraqi army from 1981, when it numbered 200,000 soldiers in 12 divisions and 3 independent brigades, to 1985, when it had 500,000 men in 23 divisions and nine brigades. The first new divisions were created in 1981 when the 11th and 12th Border Guard Divisions were converted into infantry formations and the 14th Infantry Division was formed.<ref>Pollack 2002 p.&nbsp;207</ref> Yet the rise in number of divisions is misleading, because during the war Iraqi divisions abandoned a standard organisation with permanent ('organic') brigades assigned to each division. Instead division headquarters were assigned a mission or sector and then assigned brigades to carry out the task - up to eight to ten brigades on some occasions.<ref>Pollack 2002 p.&nbsp;208</ref>\n\nThe war came at a great cost in lives and economic damage - a half a million Iraqi and Iranian soldiers as well as civilians are believed to have died in the war with many more injured and wounded - but brought neither reparations nor change in borders. The conflict is often compared to [[World War I]],<ref>Abrahamian, Ervand, ''A History of Modern Iran'', Cambridge, 2008, p.171</ref> in that the tactics used closely mirrored those of the 1914\u20131918 war, including large scale [[trench warfare]], manned machine-gun posts, bayonet charges, use of [[barbed wire]] across trenches and on [[no-mans land]], [[human wave attacks]] by Iran, and Iraq's extensive use of [[chemical weapons]] (such as [[mustard gas]]) against Iranian [[troops]] and [[civilians]] as well as [[Halabja chemical attack|Iraqi Kurds]].\n\n===Invasion of Kuwait and the Persian Gulf War===\nBy the eve of the [[Invasion of Kuwait]] which led to the 1991 [[Persian Gulf War]], the army was estimated to number 1,000,000 men.<ref>Brassey's, [[IISS]] Military Balance 1989-90, p.101</ref> Just before the [[Persian Gulf War]] began, the force comprised 47 infantry divisions plus 9 armoured and mechanised divisions, grouped in 7 corps.<ref name=\"Michael Eisenstadt 1993, p.124\">Michael Eisenstadt, 'The Iraqi Armed Forces Two Years On, [[Jane's Intelligence Review]], March 1993, p.124</ref> This gave a total of about 56 army divisions, and total land force divisions reached 68 when the 12 [[Iraqi Republican Guard]] divisions were included.<ref>Eisenstadt notes that four IRG security divisions were formed between the invasion of Kuwait and the outbreak of war. They remained in Iraq during the war. Eisenstadt p.124</ref> Although it was said at the time in Western media{{Which|date=July 2018}} that Iraqi troops numbered approximately 545,000 (even 600,000) today some think<ref>Friedman, \"Desert Victory,\" USNI, 1992, 443, 446.</ref> that both the qualitative and quantitative descriptions of the Iraqi army at the time were exaggerated, as they included both temporary and auxiliary support elements. Many{{How many|date=July 2018}} of the Iraqi troops were also young, under-resourced and poorly trained [[conscript]]s. Saddam did not trust the army; among counterbalancing security forces was the [[Iraqi Popular Army]].\n\n[[File:Demolished vehicles line Highway 80 on 18 Apr 1991.jpg|thumb|left|Demolished Iraqi vehicles line the [[Highway of Death]] on 18 April 1991.]]\nThe wide range of suppliers of Iraqi equipment resulted in a lack of standardization in this large heterogeneous force. It additionally suffered from poor training and poor motivation. The majority of Iraqi armoured forces still used old Chinese [[Type 59 tank|Type 59s]] and [[Type 69]]s, Soviet-made [[T-55]]s & [[T-62]]s from the 1950s and 1960s, and some [[T-72]]s from the 1970s in 1991. These machines were not equipped with up-to-date equipment, such as [[thermal sight]]s or [[laser rangefinder]]s, and their effectiveness in modern combat was very limited. The Iraqis failed to find an effective countermeasure to the thermal sights and the [[kinetic energy round|sabot rounds]] used by the [[M1 Abrams]], [[Challenger 1 tank|Challenger 1]] and the other Coalition tanks. This equipment enabled Coalition M1A1s to effectively engage and destroy Iraqi tanks from well outside the distance (e.g. 8,200&nbsp;ft to Iraqi ranges of 6,600&nbsp;ft) that Iraqi tanks could engage.\n\nThe Iraqi tank crews used old, cheap steel [[Kinetic energy penetrator|penetrators]]{{Which|date=July 2018}} against the advanced [[Chobham Armour]] of these US and British tanks, with disastrous results{{Clarify|reason=What were the results?|date=July 2018}}. The Iraqi forces also failed to utilize the advantage that could be gained from using [[urban warfare]]&nbsp;\u2014 fighting within [[Kuwait City]]&nbsp;\u2014 which could have inflicted significant casualties on the attacking forces. Urban combat reduces the range at which fighting occurs and can negate some of the technological advantage that well equipped forces enjoy. Iraqis also tried to use [[Military doctrine#Russia and the Soviet Union|Soviet military doctrine]], but the implementation failed due to the lack of skill of their commanders and the preventive air strikes of the [[USAF]] and [[RAF]] on communication centers and bunkers.\n\nWhile the exact number of Iraqi combat casualties has yet to be firmly determined, sources agree that the losses were substantial. Immediate estimates said up to 100,000 Iraqis were killed. More recent estimates indicate that Iraq probably sustained between 20,000 and 35,000 fatalities, though other figures still maintain fatalities could have been as high as 200,000.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Robert Fisk, ''The Great War For Civilisation; The Conquest of the Middle East'' (Fourth Estate, 2005), p.853.</ref> A report commissioned by the U.S. Air Force, estimated 10,000-12,000 Iraqi combat deaths in the air campaign and as many as 10,000 casualties in the ground war.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Keaney |first=Thomas |author2=Eliot A.

A fifth was formed in 1959. By the outbreak of the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]], the force had grown to nine divisions. By 1990, with wartime expansion, the force had grown greatly to at least 56 divisions, making the Iraqi army the fourth largest army in the world and one of the strongest in the Middle East. After the defeat in the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] in 1991, force size dropped to around 23 divisions, as well as [[Iraqi Republican Guard|Republican Guard]] formations. The new army formed after 2003 was initially planned to be three divisions strong, but was then raised to ten divisions, and the force is now expected to grow to 20 divisions.\n\nThe U.S. [[House Armed Services Committee]] commented in 2007 that \"It is important to note that in the initial fielding plan, five army divisions would be tied to the regions from where they were recruited and the other five would be deployable throughout Iraq. This was partially due to the legacy of some army divisions being formed from the National Guard units and has caused some complications in terms of making these forces available for operations in all areas of Iraq, and the military becoming a truly national, non-sectarian force.\"<ref>[[House Armed Services Committee]], {{cite web|url=http://armedservices.house.gov/pdfs/OI_ISFreport062707/OI_Report_FINAL.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627175546/http://armedservices.house.gov/pdfs/OI_ISFreport062707/OI_Report_FINAL.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=27 June 2007|title=THE CONTINUING CHALLENGE OF BUILDING THE IRAQI SECURITY FORCES (note 53, page 120)|format=PDF|date=27 June 2007}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Department of Defense]] ''Measuring Safety and Security in Iraq'' report of August 2006, plans at that time called for the Iraqi Army to be built up to an approximately 300,000-person force. This was based around an Army with 10 infantry divisions and 6 mechanised infantry division consisting of 36 brigades and 113 battalions (91 infantry, 12 special forces, 24 mechanised infantry, 60 armored battalions, 1 security). Nine Motorized Transportation Regiments, 5 logistics battalions, 2 support battalions, 5 Regional Support Units (RSUs), and 91 Garrison Support Units (GSUs) are intended to provide logistics and support for each division, with Taji National Depot providing  depot-level maintenance and resupply. Each battalion, brigade, and division headquarters will be supported by a Headquarters and Service Company (HSC) providing logistical and maintenance support to its parent organisation. The army will also include 17 SIBs and a Special Operations Forces Brigade consisting of two special operational battalions.<ref name=\"MSSIAug06\">{{cite web|url=http://www.defenselink.mil/pubs/pdfs/Security-Stabilty-ReportAug29r1.pdf|title=United States Department of Defense|website=www.defenselink.mil|access-date=2007-09-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911200618/http://www.defenselink.mil/pubs/pdfs/Security-Stabilty-ReportAug29r1.pdf|archive-date=2007-09-11|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Iraqi tanks during the parade.jpg|thumb|left|Iraqi T-72s pass in review in Baghdad, June 30, 2009.]]\nThe Iraqi Army consists of nine regional joint commands.

The [[Iraqi Ground Forces Command]] does not directly command the army's divisions.\n\nAs of July 2009, the Iraqi Army had 14 divisions (1st-12th, 14th, and 17th, the designation 13 not being used), containing 56 brigades or 185 combat battalions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} The 6th Division and the 17th Division are still missing their fourth manoeuvre brigades.

They are the [[Baghdad Brigade]] formed in the fall of 2008, the [[1st Presidential Brigade]] formed in January 2008, and the [[2nd Presidential Brigade]] formed in the spring of 2009.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n== Rank insignia ==\n{{main|Military ranks of Iraq}}\n\n==Training==\n[[File:Iraqi soldier with AKM.jpg|thumb|left|Iraqi soldiers perform a live-fire exercise using Bulgarian AR-M1 rifles.]]\n[[File:Female iraqi soldier with a Kalashnikov.JPEG|thumb|left|A [[Women in the military|female Iraqi soldier]] during live weapons training at the Jordanian Royal Military Academy.]]\n[[File:Iraqi T-72 tank fires.JPG|thumb|left|An Iraqi Army T-72 tank performs a live-fire training exercise at the [[Besmaya Range Complex|Besmaya Gunnery Range]], in Besmaya, Baghdad, 28 October 2008.]]\n\nThere are three levels of troop capability in the new army: one, two, and three.

Former soldiers are eligible for an abbreviated three-week \"Direct Recruit Replacement Training\" course designed to replace regular basic training to be followed by more training once they have been assigned to a unit.\n\nSoldiers later go on to enroll in more specific advanced courses targeted for their respective fields.  This could involve going to the Military Intelligence School, the Signal School, the Bomb Disposal School, the Combat Arms Branch School, the Engineer School, and the Military Police School.\n\n===Officers===\nThe Iraqi Armed Service and Supply Institute located in [[Taji]] plays a significant role in training aspiring Iraqi [[non-commissioned officer]]s and [[commissioned officers]].  The training is based on a [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Sandhurst]] model, chosen in part due to its shorter graduation time compared to [[United States Military Academy|West Point]]. Much of the Iraqi officer training programme is copied directly from the Sandhurst course.\n\nCMATT's main recruiting stations are located in [[Baghdad]], [[Basra]] and [[Mosul]]. The most desired recruits are individuals who have prior military service or are skilled in specific professions such as first aid, heavy equipment operation, food service and truck driving. A recruitment target of approximately one thousand soldiers is desired to eventually form a 757-man battalion.  Soldier fallout usually occurs due to voluntary withdrawal or failure to meet training standards.\n\nDue to the current demand for these battalions to become active as soon as possible, the first four battalions' officers, non-commissioned officers, and enlisted soldiers are being trained simultaneously (in separate groups). Notable differences in training between CAATT and former training under [[Saddam Hussein|Saddam]]'s regime include schooling in human rights, the laws of land warfare, and tolerance in a multi-ethnic team.\n\nBased on the philosophy used by the U.S. military to boost its own size in response to World War II \u2014 that an army can be built faster by focusing on the training on its leadership rather than enlisted soldiers \u2014 CMATT has pursued a similar strategy of focusing recruitment and training on commissioned and non-commissioned officers for the remaining 23 Iraqi battalions. Upon successful completion of officer training, these groups of officers will form the battalion's leadership cadre, which will then be responsible for overseeing its own recruitment, training, and readiness of its enlisted men. It is hoped that having the Iraqi leadership train its own will overcome problems faced by CAATT's training process; namely recruitment, desertion, and unit loyalty.\n\n===Military Transition Teams===\nAll Iraqi Army battalions have embedded U.S. [[Military transition team]]s, according to the [[National Strategy for Victory in Iraq]]. The MiTTs advise their Iraqi battalions in the areas of intelligence, communications, fire support, logistics and infantry tactics. Larger scale operations are often done jointly with American battalions. This operational training aims to make the battalion self-sustainable tactically, operationally and logistically so that the battalion will be prepared to take over responsibility for battle space.\n\nThe DOD (as of March '07) reported that 6000 advisors arranged in 480+ teams were embedded with Iraqi units.<ref name=\"DOD 03/07\">U.S. Department of Defense, ''Measuring Stability and Security in Iraq (March 2007)'', p.&nbsp;23, p.&nbsp;25</ref> However, in April, the [[Congressional Research Service]] reported that only around 4000 U.S. forces were embedded with Iraqi units at a rate of 10 per battalion.<ref name=\"CRS 2007-04-27\" /> Former U.S. Army analyst [[Andrew Krepinevich]] argued that the roughly twelve advisors per Iraqi battalion (approximately 500 troops) is less than half the sufficient amount needed to efficiently implement the combat advisory effort .<ref>Andrew F.

The Mussa Al-Kadhum Brigade consisted of ex-Iraqi-Ottoman officers, whose barracks were located in [[Kadhimyah]].{{sfn|Pollack|2002|p=149}} The United Kingdom provided support and training to the Iraqi Army and the Iraqi Air Force through a small military mission based in [[Baghdad]].<ref>Lyman, p. 25</ref> Iraqi Army Day celebrates the soldiers that fight for Iraq.\n\n===Royal Iraqi Army===\n{{Main|Kingdom of Iraq}}\nFrom 1533 to 1918, [[Ottoman Iraq|Iraq]] was under the rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]], and fought as part of the [[Military of the Ottoman Empire]]. After 1917, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] took control of the country. The first Iraqi military forces established by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] were the [[Iraq Levies]], several battalions of troops tasked to guard the [[Royal Air Force]] ([[RAF]]) bases from which the British controlled Iraq.\n\nIn August 1921, the British installed [[Hashemite]] [[King of Iraq|King]] [[Faisal I of Iraq|Faisal I]] as the client ruler of the [[Mandatory Iraq|British Mandate of Iraq]]. Faisal had been forced out as the [[King of Syria]] by the [[French Third Republic|French]]. Likewise, British authorities selected [[Sunni]] Arab elites from the region for appointments to government and ministry offices in Iraq. The British and the Iraqis formalized the relationship between the two nations with the [[Anglo-Iraqi Treaty|Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1922]]. With Faisal's ascension to the throne, the Iraqi Army became the Royal Iraqi Army (RIrA).\n\nIn 1922, the army totalled 3,618 men. This was well below the 6,000 men requested by the Iraqi monarchy and even less than the British set limit of 4,500. Unattractive salaries hindered early recruiting efforts. At this time, the United Kingdom maintained the right to levy local forces like the British-officered [[Iraq Levies]] which were under direct British control. With a strength of 4,984 men, the Iraq Levies outnumbered the army with its British set limit of 4,500 men.\n\nIn 1924, the army grew to 5,772 men and, by the following year, had grown still more to reach 7,500 men. It was to stay at 7,500 men until 1933. The force now had six infantry battalions, three cavalry regiments, two mountain regiments, and one field battery.<ref>Al-Marashi, pp. 23\u201324</ref>\n\nIn 1932, the [[Kingdom of Iraq]] was granted official independence. This was in accordance with the [[Anglo-Iraqi Treaty (1930)|Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930]], whereby the [[United Kingdom]] would end its official mandate on the condition that the Iraqi government would allow British advisers to take part in government affairs, allow British military bases to remain, and a requirement that Iraq assist the United Kingdom in wartime.<ref>Ghareeb, Edmund A.; Dougherty, Beth K. ''Historical Dictionary of Iraq''. Lanham, Maryland and Oxford: The Scarecrow Press, Ltd., 2004. Pp. lvii.</ref>\n\nUpon achieving independence in 1932, political tensions arose over the continued British presence in Iraq, with Iraq's government and politicians split between those considered pro-British and those who were considered anti-British. The pro-British faction was represented by politicians such as [[Nuri as-Said]] who did not oppose a continued British presence. The anti-British faction was represented by politicians such as [[Rashid Ali al-Gaylani]] who demanded that remaining British influence in the country be removed.<ref name=\"Ghareeb; Dougherty.

[[List of Prime Ministers of Iraq|Prime Minister]] [[Taha al-Hashimi]] resigned and Rashid Ali al-Gaylani took his place as Prime Minister.  Rashid Ali also proclaimed himself chief of a \"National Defence Government.\"  He did not overthrow the monarchy, but installed a more compliant [[Regent]].  He also attempted to restrict the rights of the British which were granted them under the 1930 treaty.\n\nOn April 30 Iraqi Army units took the high ground to the south of [[RAF Habbaniya]]. An Iraqi envoy was sent to demand that no movements, either ground or air, were to take place from the base. The British refused the demand and then themselves demanded that the Iraqi units leave the area at once. In addition, the British landed forces at [[Basra]] and the Iraqis demanded that these forces be removed.\n\nAt 0500 hours on 2 May 1941, the [[Anglo-Iraqi War]] broke out between the British and Rashid Ali's new government when the British at [[RAF Habbaniya]] launched [[air strikes]] against the Iraqis. By this time, the army had grown significantly. It had four infantry divisions with some 60,000 men.<ref>Playfair, I.S.O.; and others (2006).

The Iraqi [[1st Division (Iraq)|1st]] and [[3rd Division (Iraq)|3rd Divisions]] were stationed in Baghdad. Also based within Baghdad was the Independent Mechanized Brigade comprising a [[L3/35]] light tank company, an [[Crossley Motors|armoured car company]], two battalions of [[motorized infantry|\"mechanized\" infantry]] transported in trucks, a \"mechanized\" machine-gun company, and a \"mechanized\" artillery brigade. The [[2nd Division (Iraq)|2nd Division]] was stationed in [[Kirkuk]], and the 4th Division was in [[Al Diwaniyah]], on the main rail line from Baghdad to Basra. All these \"mechanized\" infantry units were transported by trucks.\n\nHostilities between the British and the Iraqis lasted from 2 May to 30 May 1941. The German government despatched an aviation unit, [[Fliegerf\u00fchrer Irak]], and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] send limited assistance, but both were too late and far from adequate. In the end, the British were able to march on [[Baghdad]] and Rashid Ali al-Gaylani fled.\n\nAfter the Anglo-Iraqi War ended, Nuri as-Said returned as Prime Minister and dominated the politics of Iraq until the overthrow of the monarchy and his assassination in 1958. Nuri as-Said pursued a largely pro-[[Western world|western policy]] during this period.<ref>Ghareeb; Dougherty. Pp lviii</ref> The army was not disbanded. Instead, it was maintained to hinder possible German offensive actions launched from southern [[RSFSR|Russia]]. British troops left in the late 1940s.\n\n=== 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War ===\nIn the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]], the Iraqis deployed an expeditionary force which peaked at 15,000\u201318,000 men.{{sfn|Pollack|2002|p=150, 156}} In 1948, the army deployed 21,000 men in twelve brigades and the [[Iraqi Air Force|Royal Iraqi Air Force]] deployed 100 planes, mostly British. Initially the Iraqis committed around 3,000<ref>D. Kurzman, ''Genesis 1948'', 1972, p. 382.</ref> men to the war effort including four infantry brigades, one armoured battalion and support personnel. These forces were to operate under Jordanian guidance<ref>I. Pappe, ''The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine'', 2006, p. 129.</ref> During the first truce the Iraqis increased their force to about 10,000.<ref>Kurzman, p. 556.</ref> Ultimately, the Iraqi expeditionary force numbered around 15,000 to 18,000 men.{{sfn|Pollack|2002|p=150}}\n\nThe first Iraqi forces to be deployed reached Jordan in April 1948 under the command of General [[Nur ad-Din Mahmud]]. On 15 May, Iraqi engineers built a [[pontoon bridge]] across the Jordan River and attacked the Israeli settlement of [[Gesher, Israel|Gesher]]. Over 3,000 Iraqi soldiers with armor and air support were unable to defeat less than 50 lightly armed Jewish defenders. Following this defeat Iraqi forces moved into the [[Nablus]]\u2013[[Jenin]]\u2013[[Tulkarm]] strategic triangle, where they suffered heavy casualties in the Israeli attack on Jenin which began on 3 June, but they managed to hold on to their positions. Active Iraqi involvement in the war effectively ended at this point.{{sfn|Pollack|2002|p=149\u2013155}}\n\nIn May 1955 the British finally withdrew from Iraq. The Iraqi authorities said during the withdrawal negotiations that a motorised infantry brigade was to be formed, based at the previous [[RAF Habbaniya]], a location that had been occupied by the British [[Iraq Levies]].<ref>Solomon (Sawa) Solomon, [http://www.edessa.com/history/solmn1.htm \"The Assyrian Levies, The Final Chapter\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722133011/http://www.edessa.com/history/solmn1.htm |date=2011-07-22 }}, ''Nineveh Magazine'' 4Q,93, V16, No4.</ref>\n\n===Republic declared===\n{{Main|Iraqi Republic (1958\u201368)}}\n\nThe [[Hashemite monarchy]] lasted until 1958, when it was overthrown through a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] by the Iraqi Army, known as the [[14 July Revolution]]. King [[Faisal II of Iraq]] along with members of the royal family were murdered. The coup brought [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]] to power. He withdrew from the [[Baghdad Pact]] and established friendly relations with the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nWhen Q\u0101sim distanced himself from [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Abd an-N\u0101sir]], he faced growing opposition from pro-Egypt officers in the Iraqi army. `Arif, who wanted closer cooperation with Egypt, was stripped of his responsibilities and thrown in prison. When the garrison in [[Mosul]] rebelled against Q\u0101sim's policies, he allowed the Kurdish leader [[Mustafa Barzani|Barz\u0101n\u012b]] to return from exile in the Soviet Union to help suppress the pro-N\u0101sir rebels.\n\nThe creation of the new Fifth Division, consisting of mechanized infantry, was announced on 6 January 1959, [[Army Day]].<ref>''[[The Times]]'', 'New Division for Iraq Army,' 7 January 1959</ref> Q\u0101sim was also promoted to the rank of general.\n\nIn 1961, an Army buildup close to [[Kuwait]] in conjunction with Iraqi claims over the small neighbouring state, led to a crisis with British military forces ([[British army|land]], [[Royal Navy|sea]], and [[Royal Air force|air]]) deployed to Kuwait for a period. In 1961, [[Kuwait]] gained independence from Britain and Iraq claimed sovereignty over Kuwait. As in the 1930s, Qasim based Iraq's claim on the assertion that Kuwait had been a district of the Ottoman province of Basra, unjustly severed by the British from the main body of Iraqi state when it had been created in the 1920s.<ref>Tripp, Charles. ''A History of Iraq''. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2002, p.165</ref> Britain reacted strongly to Iraq's claim and sent troops to Kuwait to deter Iraq. Q\u0101sim was forced to back down and in October 1963, Iraq recognized the sovereignty of Kuwait.\n\nQ\u0101sim was assassinated in February 1963, when the [[Ba'ath Party]] [[February 1963 Iraqi coup d'\u00e9tat|took power]] under the leadership of General [[Ahmed Hasan al-Bakr]] ([[Prime Minister of Iraq|prime minister]]) and Colonel [[Abdul Salam Arif]] ([[President of Iraq|president]]). Nine months later `Abd as-Salam Muhammad `Arif led a successful coup against the Ba'ath government. On 13 April 1966, President Abdul Salam Arif died in a helicopter crash and was succeeded by his brother, General [[Abdul Rahman Arif]]. Following the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967, the Ba'ath Party felt strong enough to retake power (17 July 1968). Ahmad Hasan al-Bakr became president and chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC).\n\n===Six-Day War===\n[[File:Iraqi AML-60-20.jpg|thumb|Iraqi Army [[Panhard AML|Panhard AML-60]] armored car, 1970s. Iraq ordered about 250 of these vehicles between 1968 and 1976.]]\nDuring the Six-Day War, the Iraqi [[3rd Division (Iraq)|3rd Armoured Division]] was deployed in eastern Jordan.<ref>Pollack, 2002, p.167</ref> However, the Israeli attack against the West Bank unfolded so quickly that the Iraqi force could not organise itself and reach the front before Jordan ceased fighting. Repeated Israeli airstrikes also held them up so that by the time they did reach the [[Jordan River]] the entire [[West Bank]] was in Israeli hands. During the course of the [[Jordanian campaign (1967)|Jordanian Campaign]] ten Iraqis were killed and 30 Iraqis were wounded, especially as the main battle was in Jerusalem. Fighting also raged in other areas of the West Bank, where Iraqi commandos and Jordanian soldiers defended their positions.<ref>Follow me- The story of the Six Day War 2. Six Day War- Tom Segev</ref>\n\nBarz\u0101n\u012b and the Kurds who had begun a rebellion in 1961 were still causing problems in 1969. The secretary-general of the Ba`th party, [[Saddam Hussein]], was given responsibility to find a solution. It was clear that it was impossible to defeat the Kurds by military means and in 1970 a political agreement was reached between the rebels and the Iraqi government.\n\nFollowing the Arab defeat in 1967, Jordan became a hotbed of Palestinian activity. During this time PLO elements attempted to create a Palestinian state within Jordan caused the Jordanians to launch their full military force against the PLO. As they were doing this Syria invaded Jordan and Iraq moved a brigade in Rihab, Jordan.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Otherwise the only Iraqi activity was that they fired upon some Jordanian aircraft.\n\nIraq sent a 60,000 man expeditionary force to the Syrian front during the [[Yom Kippur War]]. It consisted of the 3rd and [[6th Division (Iraq)|6th Armoured Divisions]], two infantry brigades, twelve artillery battalions, and a special forces brigade. The two armoured divisions were, Pollack says, 'unquestionably the best formations of the Iraqi Army.'(Pollack p.&nbsp;167) Yet during their operations on the Golan Heights, their performance was awful in virtually every category of military effectiveness. Military intelligence, initiative, and small unit independent action was virtually absent.<ref>Pollack p.173-5, citing among others Tzvi Ofer, 'The Iraqi Army in the Yom Kippur War,' transl. 'Hatzav,' Tel Aviv: Ma'arachot, 1986, p.128-65. Pollack notes that the various accounts of Iraqi operations on the Golan Heights are highly contradictory. He relies on Ofer, 1986, which is an Israeli General Staff critique of the official Iraqi General Staff analysis of the battle.</ref>\n\nAfter the war, Iraq started a major military build-up. Active duty manpower doubled, and so did number of divisions, from six to twelve, of which four were now armoured and two mechanised infantry. (Pollack p.&nbsp;182)\n\n===Iran\u2013Iraq war===\n{{see also|Order of battle during the Iran\u2013Iraq War}}\nLater, Saddam Hussein, looking to build fighting power against Iran soon after the outbreak of the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] doubled the size of the Iraqi army from 1981, when it numbered 200,000 soldiers in 12 divisions and 3 independent brigades, to 1985, when it had 500,000 men in 23 divisions and nine brigades. The first new divisions were created in 1981 when the 11th and 12th Border Guard Divisions were converted into infantry formations and the 14th Infantry Division was formed.<ref>Pollack 2002 p.&nbsp;207</ref> Yet the rise in number of divisions is misleading, because during the war Iraqi divisions abandoned a standard organisation with permanent ('organic') brigades assigned to each division. Instead division headquarters were assigned a mission or sector and then assigned brigades to carry out the task - up to eight to ten brigades on some occasions.<ref>Pollack 2002 p.&nbsp;208</ref>\n\nThe war came at a great cost in lives and economic damage - a half a million Iraqi and Iranian soldiers as well as civilians are believed to have died in the war with many more injured and wounded - but brought neither reparations nor change in borders. The conflict is often compared to [[World War I]],<ref>Abrahamian, Ervand, ''A History of Modern Iran'', Cambridge, 2008, p.171</ref> in that the tactics used closely mirrored those of the 1914\u20131918 war, including large scale [[trench warfare]], manned machine-gun posts, bayonet charges, use of [[barbed wire]] across trenches and on [[no-mans land]], [[human wave attacks]] by Iran, and Iraq's extensive use of [[chemical weapons]] (such as [[mustard gas]]) against Iranian [[troops]] and [[civilians]] as well as [[Halabja chemical attack|Iraqi Kurds]].\n\n===Invasion of Kuwait and the Persian Gulf War===\nBy the eve of the [[Invasion of Kuwait]] which led to the 1991 [[Persian Gulf War]], the army was estimated to number 1,000,000 men.<ref>Brassey's, [[IISS]] Military Balance 1989-90, p.101</ref> Just before the [[Persian Gulf War]] began, the force comprised 47 infantry divisions plus 9 armoured and mechanised divisions, grouped in 7 corps.<ref name=\"Michael Eisenstadt 1993, p.124\">Michael Eisenstadt, 'The Iraqi Armed Forces Two Years On, [[Jane's Intelligence Review]], March 1993, p.124</ref> This gave a total of about 56 army divisions, and total land force divisions reached 68 when the 12 [[Iraqi Republican Guard]] divisions were included.<ref>Eisenstadt notes that four IRG security divisions were formed between the invasion of Kuwait and the outbreak of war. They remained in Iraq during the war. Eisenstadt p.124</ref> Although it was said at the time in Western media{{Which|date=July 2018}} that Iraqi troops numbered approximately 545,000 (even 600,000) today some think<ref>Friedman, \"Desert Victory,\" USNI, 1992, 443, 446.</ref> that both the qualitative and quantitative descriptions of the Iraqi army at the time were exaggerated, as they included both temporary and auxiliary support elements. Many{{How many|date=July 2018}} of the Iraqi troops were also young, under-resourced and poorly trained [[conscript]]s. Saddam did not trust the army; among counterbalancing security forces was the [[Iraqi Popular Army]].\n\n[[File:Demolished vehicles line Highway 80 on 18 Apr 1991.jpg|thumb|left|Demolished Iraqi vehicles line the [[Highway of Death]] on 18 April 1991.]]\nThe wide range of suppliers of Iraqi equipment resulted in a lack of standardization in this large heterogeneous force. It additionally suffered from poor training and poor motivation. The majority of Iraqi armoured forces still used old Chinese [[Type 59 tank|Type 59s]] and [[Type 69]]s, Soviet-made [[T-55]]s & [[T-62]]s from the 1950s and 1960s, and some [[T-72]]s from the 1970s in 1991. These machines were not equipped with up-to-date equipment, such as [[thermal sight]]s or [[laser rangefinder]]s, and their effectiveness in modern combat was very limited. The Iraqis failed to find an effective countermeasure to the thermal sights and the [[kinetic energy round|sabot rounds]] used by the [[M1 Abrams]], [[Challenger 1 tank|Challenger 1]] and the other Coalition tanks. This equipment enabled Coalition M1A1s to effectively engage and destroy Iraqi tanks from well outside the distance (e.g. 8,200&nbsp;ft to Iraqi ranges of 6,600&nbsp;ft) that Iraqi tanks could engage.\n\nThe Iraqi tank crews used old, cheap steel [[Kinetic energy penetrator|penetrators]]{{Which|date=July 2018}} against the advanced [[Chobham Armour]] of these US and British tanks, with disastrous results{{Clarify|reason=What were the results?|date=July 2018}}. The Iraqi forces also failed to utilize the advantage that could be gained from using [[urban warfare]]&nbsp;\u2014 fighting within [[Kuwait City]]&nbsp;\u2014 which could have inflicted significant casualties on the attacking forces. Urban combat reduces the range at which fighting occurs and can negate some of the technological advantage that well equipped forces enjoy. Iraqis also tried to use [[Military doctrine#Russia and the Soviet Union|Soviet military doctrine]], but the implementation failed due to the lack of skill of their commanders and the preventive air strikes of the [[USAF]] and [[RAF]] on communication centers and bunkers.\n\nWhile the exact number of Iraqi combat casualties has yet to be firmly determined, sources agree that the losses were substantial. Immediate estimates said up to 100,000 Iraqis were killed. More recent estimates indicate that Iraq probably sustained between 20,000 and 35,000 fatalities, though other figures still maintain fatalities could have been as high as 200,000.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Robert Fisk, ''The Great War For Civilisation; The Conquest of the Middle East'' (Fourth Estate, 2005), p.853.</ref> A report commissioned by the U.S. Air Force, estimated 10,000-12,000 Iraqi combat deaths in the air campaign and as many as 10,000 casualties in the ground war.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Keaney |first=Thomas |author2=Eliot A.

A fifth was formed in 1959. By the outbreak of the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]], the force had grown to nine divisions. By 1990, with wartime expansion, the force had grown greatly to at least 56 divisions, making the Iraqi army the fourth largest army in the world and one of the strongest in the Middle East. After the defeat in the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] in 1991, force size dropped to around 23 divisions, as well as [[Iraqi Republican Guard|Republican Guard]] formations. The new army formed after 2003 was initially planned to be three divisions strong, but was then raised to ten divisions, and the force is now expected to grow to 20 divisions.\n\nThe U.S. [[House Armed Services Committee]] commented in 2007 that \"It is important to note that in the initial fielding plan, five army divisions would be tied to the regions from where they were recruited and the other five would be deployable throughout Iraq. This was partially due to the legacy of some army divisions being formed from the National Guard units and has caused some complications in terms of making these forces available for operations in all areas of Iraq, and the military becoming a truly national, non-sectarian force.\"<ref>[[House Armed Services Committee]], {{cite web|url=http://armedservices.house.gov/pdfs/OI_ISFreport062707/OI_Report_FINAL.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627175546/http://armedservices.house.gov/pdfs/OI_ISFreport062707/OI_Report_FINAL.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=27 June 2007|title=THE CONTINUING CHALLENGE OF BUILDING THE IRAQI SECURITY FORCES (note 53, page 120)|format=PDF|date=27 June 2007}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Department of Defense]] ''Measuring Safety and Security in Iraq'' report of August 2006, plans at that time called for the Iraqi Army to be built up to an approximately 300,000-person force. This was based around an Army with 10 infantry divisions and 6 mechanised infantry division consisting of 36 brigades and 113 battalions (91 infantry, 12 special forces, 24 mechanised infantry, 60 armored battalions, 1 security). Nine Motorized Transportation Regiments, 5 logistics battalions, 2 support battalions, 5 Regional Support Units (RSUs), and 91 Garrison Support Units (GSUs) are intended to provide logistics and support for each division, with Taji National Depot providing  depot-level maintenance and resupply. Each battalion, brigade, and division headquarters will be supported by a Headquarters and Service Company (HSC) providing logistical and maintenance support to its parent organisation. The army will also include 17 SIBs and a Special Operations Forces Brigade consisting of two special operational battalions.<ref name=\"MSSIAug06\">{{cite web|url=http://www.defenselink.mil/pubs/pdfs/Security-Stabilty-ReportAug29r1.pdf|title=United States Department of Defense|website=www.defenselink.mil|access-date=2007-09-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911200618/http://www.defenselink.mil/pubs/pdfs/Security-Stabilty-ReportAug29r1.pdf|archive-date=2007-09-11|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Iraqi tanks during the parade.jpg|thumb|left|Iraqi T-72s pass in review in Baghdad, June 30, 2009.]]\nThe Iraqi Army consists of nine regional joint commands.

The [[Iraqi Ground Forces Command]] does not directly command the army's divisions.\n\nAs of July 2009, the Iraqi Army had 14 divisions (1st-12th, 14th, and 17th, the designation 13 not being used), containing 56 brigades or 185 combat battalions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} The 6th Division and the 17th Division are still missing their fourth manoeuvre brigades.

They are the [[Baghdad Brigade]] formed in the fall of 2008, the [[1st Presidential Brigade]] formed in January 2008, and the [[2nd Presidential Brigade]] formed in the spring of 2009.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n== Rank insignia ==\n{{main|Military ranks of Iraq}}\n\n==Training==\n[[File:Iraqi soldier with AKM.jpg|thumb|left|Iraqi soldiers perform a live-fire exercise using Bulgarian AR-M1 rifles.]]\n[[File:Female iraqi soldier with a Kalashnikov.JPEG|thumb|left|A [[Women in the military|female Iraqi soldier]] during live weapons training at the Jordanian Royal Military Academy.]]\n[[File:Iraqi T-72 tank fires.JPG|thumb|left|An Iraqi Army T-72 tank performs a live-fire training exercise at the [[Besmaya Range Complex|Besmaya Gunnery Range]], in Besmaya, Baghdad, 28 October 2008.]]\n\nThere are three levels of troop capability in the new army: one, two, and three.

Former soldiers are eligible for an abbreviated three-week \"Direct Recruit Replacement Training\" course designed to replace regular basic training to be followed by more training once they have been assigned to a unit.\n\nSoldiers later go on to enroll in more specific advanced courses targeted for their respective fields.  This could involve going to the Military Intelligence School, the Signal School, the Bomb Disposal School, the Combat Arms Branch School, the Engineer School, and the Military Police School.\n\n===Officers===\nThe Iraqi Armed Service and Supply Institute located in [[Taji]] plays a significant role in training aspiring Iraqi [[non-commissioned officer]]s and [[commissioned officers]].  The training is based on a [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Sandhurst]] model, chosen in part due to its shorter graduation time compared to [[United States Military Academy|West Point]]. Much of the Iraqi officer training programme is copied directly from the Sandhurst course.\n\nCMATT's main recruiting stations are located in [[Baghdad]], [[Basra]] and [[Mosul]]. The most desired recruits are individuals who have prior military service or are skilled in specific professions such as first aid, heavy equipment operation, food service and truck driving. A recruitment target of approximately one thousand soldiers is desired to eventually form a 757-man battalion.  Soldier fallout usually occurs due to voluntary withdrawal or failure to meet training standards.\n\nDue to the current demand for these battalions to become active as soon as possible, the first four battalions' officers, non-commissioned officers, and enlisted soldiers are being trained simultaneously (in separate groups). Notable differences in training between CAATT and former training under [[Saddam Hussein|Saddam]]'s regime include schooling in human rights, the laws of land warfare, and tolerance in a multi-ethnic team.\n\nBased on the philosophy used by the U.S. military to boost its own size in response to World War II \u2014 that an army can be built faster by focusing on the training on its leadership rather than enlisted soldiers \u2014 CMATT has pursued a similar strategy of focusing recruitment and training on commissioned and non-commissioned officers for the remaining 23 Iraqi battalions. Upon successful completion of officer training, these groups of officers will form the battalion's leadership cadre, which will then be responsible for overseeing its own recruitment, training, and readiness of its enlisted men. It is hoped that having the Iraqi leadership train its own will overcome problems faced by CAATT's training process; namely recruitment, desertion, and unit loyalty.\n\n===Military Transition Teams===\nAll Iraqi Army battalions have embedded U.S. [[Military transition team]]s, according to the [[National Strategy for Victory in Iraq]]. The MiTTs advise their Iraqi battalions in the areas of intelligence, communications, fire support, logistics and infantry tactics. Larger scale operations are often done jointly with American battalions. This operational training aims to make the battalion self-sustainable tactically, operationally and logistically so that the battalion will be prepared to take over responsibility for battle space.\n\nThe DOD (as of March '07) reported that 6000 advisors arranged in 480+ teams were embedded with Iraqi units.<ref name=\"DOD 03/07\">U.S. Department of Defense, ''Measuring Stability and Security in Iraq (March 2007)'', p.&nbsp;23, p.&nbsp;25</ref> However, in April, the [[Congressional Research Service]] reported that only around 4000 U.S. forces were embedded with Iraqi units at a rate of 10 per battalion.<ref name=\"CRS 2007-04-27\" /> Former U.S. Army analyst [[Andrew Krepinevich]] argued that the roughly twelve advisors per Iraqi battalion (approximately 500 troops) is less than half the sufficient amount needed to efficiently implement the combat advisory effort .<ref>Andrew F.

The second phase started from November 1899 when the Revolutionary army was dissipated into \"guerrilla\" -style warfare. This was based on smaller organized units of soldiers and local civilian supporters. Leadership became arbitrary with succession of \"generals\" and \"commanders\" based on who was second in command from the hierarchy of the old republic or who has more supporters or people under one's command. The remnants of the First Philippine Republic continued the struggle for independence into local regional and provincial levels as late as 1915.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history.state.gov/milestones/1899-1913/war |title=The Philippine-American War, 1899\u20131902 |publisher=Office of the Historian, Foreign Service Institute |website=United States Department of State |access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{refbegin}}\n===Works cited in footnotes===\n* Almario, Virgilio (1998) *Rebolusyong Filipino, Intimas Memorias, memoirs of  Colonel Sityar, in Spanish, page 197,  translated to Tagalog by Almario\n* {{cite book|last= Alvarez|first=Santiago V.|title=The katipunan and the revolution: memoirs of a general : with the original Tagalog text|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F3q-krDckHwC|year=1992|publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press|isbn=978-971-550-077-7|ref=harv}}<!--note: also mentions \n\na General Mariano Alvarez (Apoy) on p.43, \na Lieutenant General Artemio Ricarte (Vibora) on p. 80, \na General Emilio Aguinaldo (Magdalo) on p.132, \na General Ramon Bernardo (Salogo) on p.145 & 163, \na General Luis Malinis on p.147,157 \na General Lucino de la Cruz (Ipo-Ipo) on p.150,\na General Francisco de Asis (Labe, Heneral Kiko) on p.152-153, 155-156, & 164-169\na General Vincente Leyba (Kalentong) on p.159 \na General Felipe Estrella on p. 182-189\na General Eusebio Roque  (Maestrong Sebio,Dimabunggo) on p. 182-189\na General Julian Santos on p. 195\na General Salvador Estrella on p. 197\na General Modesto Ritual on p.201-202 \na Information about \"Kolorum\" (Colorum) and religious-insurrection movements on p. 207\n-->\n\n* {{cite book|last= Halili|first=M.c.|title=Philippine history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gUt5v8ET4QYC|year=2004|publisher=Rex Bookstore, Inc.|isbn=978-971-23-3934-9|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last= Linn|first=Brian McAllister|authorlink=Brian McAllister Linn|title=The U.S. Army and Counterinsurgency in the Philippine War, 1899-1902|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-5WOrmt_VxcC|year=2000|publisher=UNC Press Books|isbn=978-0-8078-4948-4 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Nakpil|first=Carmen Guerrero |title=Whatever: a new collection of later essays, 1987-2001|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fV0Ro1qPjXAC|year=2002|publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press|isbn=978-971-550-417-1|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite news |url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/98377/king-of-the-philippines |title=King of the Philippines |last=Ocampo |first=Ambeth |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=October 21, 2016 |access-date=December 27, 2017}}\n* {{cite book |last= Ochosa |first= Orlino |date= January 1, 1995|title=Bandoleros, Outlawed Guerrillas of the Philippine-American War, 1903-1907 |url=https://www.bookdepository.com/Bandoleros-Outlawed-Guerrillas-Philippine-American-War-1903-1907-Orlino-Ochosa/9789711005559 |location=United States of America |publisher=New Day Publishers |isbn=9711005557|ref=harv}}<!--\nnote: also mentions \n\na General Macario Sakay on  p.25\n-->\n* {{cite book|last1=Zaide|first1=Sonia M.|last2=Zaide|first2=Gregorio F.|title=The Philippines: a unique nation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B6ZtAQAACAAJ|year=1999|publisher=All-Nations Publishing Co.|isbn=978-971-642-064-7|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|title=United States Congressional Serial Set|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HwtHAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA664|year=1902|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office}}<!--\nnote: also mentions \n\na General Berixio Consola on  p.292\n-->\n* {{Google books| kO_WgIWHPH8C|Report of the Lieutenant-General Commanding the Army, Part 9 - U.S. Government Printing Office, 1902}}<!--note: also mentions\n\na Colonel Norberto Mayo on p. 175\n--> \n* {{Google books| ML9MAAAAYAAJ|1904 Annual Report of the Secretary of War: Volume 7 United States War Dept|page=38}}\n* {{Google books| ZEhUAAAAIAAJ|1907 Congressional Serial Set - U.S. Government Printing Office|page=240}}\n* {{cite web |url=https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/ulatfilipino/311705/sino-si-heneral-kalentong-na-kilalang-kalye-sa-mandaluyong/story/ |title=Sino Si Heneral Kalentong Na Kilalang Kalye Sa Mandaluyong?

First phase was the conventional military warfare \nbetween two organized armies: The US Forces and the First Philippine Republican Army. This was period was from February to November \n1899. The second phase started from November 1899 when the Revolutionary army was dissipated into \"guerrilla\" -style warfare. This was based on smaller organized units of soldiers and local civilian supporters. Leadership became arbitrary with succession of \"generals\" and \"commanders\" based on who was second in command from the hierarchy of the old republic or who has more supporters or people under one's command.

Since the 1980s, Iraq was widely assumed to have been producing and extensively running the programs of [[Iraqi biological weapons program|biological]], [[Iraqi chemical weapons program|chemical]] and [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear weapons]]. Iraq made extensive use of chemical weapons during the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] in the 1980s, including [[Anfal genocide|against its own Kurdish population]]. France and the Soviet Union assisted Iraq in the development of its nuclear program, but its primary facility was destroyed by [[Israel]] in 1981 in a [[Operation Opera|surprise air strike]].\n\nAfter the [[Gulf War]] in 1990, the [[UNSCOM|United Nations]] located and destroyed large quantities of Iraqi chemical weapons and related equipment and materials with varying degrees of Iraqi cooperation and obstruction, but the Iraqi cooperation later diminished in 1998.<ref>\nCleminson, Ronald.

September 2003\n</ref> The disarmament issue remained tense throughout the [[Iraq disarmament timeline 1990\u20132003|1990s]] with U.S. at the UN, repeatedly demanding Iraq to allow inspections teams to its facilities. Finally, this disarmament crises reached to its climax in [[Iraq disarmament crisis timeline 2001-2003|2002-2003]], when [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]] demanded a complete end to what he alleged was Iraqi production of [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]], and reasoned with [[President of Iraq|Iraqi President]] [[Saddam Hussein]] to comply with [[List of United Nations Security Council resolutions concerning Iraq|UN Resolutions]] requiring [[UN weapons inspectors]] unfettered access to areas those inspectors thought might have weapons production facilities.\n\nSince the [[Gulf War]] in 1991, Iraq had been [[United Nations actions regarding Iraq|restricted]] by the [[United Nations]] (UN) from developing or possessing such weapons. It was also required to permit inspections to confirm Iraqi compliance. Bush repeatedly backed demands for unfettered inspection and disarmament with threats of invasion. On 20 March 2003, a [[Multinational force in Iraq|multinational alliance]] containing the armed forces of the [[United States armed forces|United States]] and [[British forces|United Kingdom]] launched an [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion]] of Iraq in 2003. After the [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq (2007\u20132011)|withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq]] in 2011, a number of [[failed Iraqi peace initiatives]] were revealed.\n\n==Background==\nIn the decade following the 1991 Gulf War, the [[United Nations]] passed 16 [[United Nations Security Council Resolution|Security Council resolutions]] calling for the complete elimination of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. [[United Nations member states|Member states]] communicated their frustration over the years that Iraq was impeding the work of the [[United Nations Special Commission|special commission]] and failing to take seriously its disarmament obligations. Iraqi security forces had on several occasions physically prevented weapons inspectors from doing their job and in at least one case, took documents away from them.\n\nOn 29 September 1998, the [[United States Congress]] passed the ''[[Iraq Liberation Act]]'' supporting the efforts of [[Iraqi anti-Saddam groups|Iraqi opposition groups]] to remove Saddam Hussein from office. The Act was signed by President Clinton on 31 October 1998. On the same day, Iraq announced it would no longer cooperate with United Nations weapons inspectors.\n\nThe UN, under [[Kofi Annan]], brokered a deal wherein Iraq would allow weapons inspectors back into the country. Iraq ceased cooperating with inspectors only days later. The inspectors left the country in December. Inspectors returned the following year as part of The [[United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission]] (UNMOVIC).\n\n[[Paul Wolfowitz]], the military analyst for the [[United States Department of Defense]] under [[Ronald Reagan]], had formulated a new [[United States foreign policy|foreign policy]] with regard to Iraq and other \"potential aggressor states\", dismissing \"containment\" in favor of \"[[Preemptive war|preemption]]\", with the goal of striking first to eliminate threats.\n\nThis policy was short-lived, however, and Clinton, along with [[George H. W. Bush]], [[Colin Powell]], and other former Bush administration officials, dismissed calls for preemption in favor of continued containment. This was the policy of George W. Bush as well for his first several months in office. The [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] brought to life Wolfowitz's and other \"hawks'\" advocacy for [[pre-emptive war|preemptive action]]; Iraq was widely agreed to be a likely subject of this new policy. Powell continued to support the philosophy behind containment.\n\nFollowing the Gulf War, the [[Iraqi Army]] was reduced to 23 divisions with a total of about 375,000 troops. The [[Iraqi Air Force]] was reduced to less than 300 aircraft. The [[Iraqi Navy]] was almost completely destroyed, and its few remaining operational vessels were in a poor state of repair, the crews were estimated to be in a poor state of readiness, and its capabilities were reduced to that of limited mining and raiding missions.<ref>\n{{cite web |author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/navy.htm |title=Iraqi Navy |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |accessdate=2013-06-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130401124247/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/navy.htm |archive-date=2013-04-01 |url-status=live }}\n</ref> Any rebuilding that was done went into the [[Republican Guard (Iraq)|Republican Guard]], and the formation of the [[Special Republican Guard]].\n\n==2002\u20132003==\n[[File:Powell UN Iraq presentation, alleged Mobile Production Facilities.jpg|thumb|300px|Diagram of alleged Mobile Production Facility For Biological Agents, presented by [[Colin Powell]] before the [[United Nations]].]]\n\n{{Main|United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441}}\n{{Expand section|date=September 2007}}\nDuring late 2002 and into 2003, the [[United States government]] continued to call for \"[[regime change]]\" in [[Iraq]] and threatened to use military force to overthrow the Iraqi government unless Iraq rid itself of all [[weapons of mass destruction]] (WMD) it supposedly possessed and convinced the UN that it had done so.\n\nUS diplomatic pressure to bring Iraq to compliance quickly created a diplomatic crisis in the UN, where some members were in agreement with the U.S. position, while others dissented, notably the permanent Security Council members [[France]], [[Russia]] and the [[People's Republic of China]], and fellow [[NATO]] members [[Germany]] and [[Belgium]].\n\nThe [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] began a military buildup in the region, and after pushing hard gained passage of [[UN Security Council Resolution 1441]]. Led by [[Hans Blix]], Head of the [[United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission]] (UNMOVIC) and [[Mohamed ElBaradei]] [[Director General]] of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA), the Resolution brought weapons inspectors back to Iraq in November 2002.\n\nInspectors began visiting sites where WMD production was suspected, but found no evidence of such activities, except for 18 undeclared empty 122&nbsp;mm chemical rockets that were destroyed under UNMOVIC supervision.

Two exceptions exist to the rule: self-defense (Article 51) or an authorization by the Security Council to protect international peace and security (Chapter VII).\n\nThe government of the United States said publicly, and the British pledged privately, that they were willing to invade Iraq with or without Security Council authorization.<ref>\n[http://politics.guardian.co.uk/iraq/story/0,,1700881,00.html Blair-Bush deal before Iraq war revealed in secret memo] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127195733/http://politics.guardian.co.uk/iraq/story/0,,1700881,00.html |date=2007-11-27 }} [[The Guardian]] February 3, 2006\n</ref>\n\nThere have been two military actions carried out with the approval of the Security Council. These two instances were the [[Korean War]] and the [[1991 Gulf War]].\n\nThe United States does not recognize the jurisdiction of any international court over its citizens or military, holding that the [[United States Supreme Court]] is its final authority. One example of this policy is that the United States did not ratify the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) treaty, and on 6 May 2002 it informed the UN that it has no intention to do so.\n\nAs of 24 February 2005 neither Iraq nor the United States have ratified the ICC treaty, and therefore neither the US attack on Iraq nor subsequent actions in Iraq fall under the jurisdiction of the ICC. The actions of signatories such as the United Kingdom and [[Spain]] could however fall under the ICC jurisdiction.\n\nOn March 17, 2003, [[Peter Goldsmith, Baron Goldsmith|Peter Goldsmith]], [[Attorney General for England and Wales]], set out his government's legal justification for an invasion of Iraq. He said that the 1990 [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 678|Security Council Resolution 678]] authorised force against Iraq, which was suspended but not terminated by the 1991 [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 687|Resolution 687]], which imposed continuing obligations on Iraq to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction. A material breach of resolution 687 would revive the authority to use force under resolution 678. In Resolution 1441 the Security Council determined that Iraq was in material breach of resolution 687 because it had not fully carried out its obligations to disarm, and in early 2003 sent teams of weapons inspectors to verify the [[facts on the ground]].\n\nMost member governments of the United Nations Security Council made clear that in their view, after resolution 1441 there was still no authorization for the use of force.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.worldpress.org/specials/iraq/ |title=International Law - War in Iraq - United Nations - Iraq |publisher=Worldpress.org |accessdate=2013-06-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730223344/http://worldpress.org/specials/iraq/ |archive-date=2013-07-30 |url-status=live }}\n</ref> However, the US and its allies argued that no resolution authorizing the invasion would be necessary anyway as they acted in self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter and by [[customary international law]].

Since Iraq was not actively disarming themselves and hid WMDs from UN inspectors many times, the US and its allies had every right to assume that Iraq was holding WMDs. If the UN failed to force compliance, the US and the UK - as parties of the 1991 conflict - would invade Iraq without the UN, as they had already done in their intervention in the [[Kosovo War]]. [[Yoram Dinstein]] equates this to [[police officers]] cornering a convicted violent felon and saying \"put your hands on your head\", but instead he pulls something small and black (whether a gun or not) out of his pocket. Officers would have been justified in shooting him because he could have possessed something that is dangerous.<ref>{{cite book |title=War, Aggression and Self-Defence |pages=298\u2013299 |date=December 12, 2011 |author=Yoram Dinstein |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}</ref>\n\n===Authority under US Constitution===\nThe [[US Constitution|Constitution]] grants the power to declare war exclusively to the [[United States Congress]], but declares the President to be [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[US military]]. Because of this division of power, there has long been controversy regarding the authority of the President outside of a declared war. Nonetheless, of the many instances the United States has exercised force outside its borders, only five have been as part of a [[Declaration of war by the United States|declared war]].\n\nIn 1973, amid increasing domestic controversy about the [[Vietnam War]], Congress passed the [[War Powers Resolution]] to limit the ability of the president to undertake prolonged military action without Congressional authority. No president since has recognized the constitutionality of this act, and most legal scholars believe it would not survive a challenge in court.\n\nTo avoid initiating a crisis under the War Powers Resolution, the Bush administration sought explicit approval from the Congress to exercise force in Iraq. On October 9, 2002, the Congress passed the [[Iraq Resolution]] which explicitly authorized the President to use the Armed Forces of the United States as he determines to be necessary and appropriate. This raises the issue of whether or not Congress has the authority to delegate legislative power to the executive branch.  However, in a recent [[United States Supreme Court]] case, ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]],'' the Supreme Court ruled that the [[military commissions]] that the President had established, (and defended by arguing that he was given the power to create military courts by this resolution), were unconstitutional because they were unauthorized by Congress.\n\nThe Constitution also provides that international treaties ratified by the United States are among the highest law of the land ([[US Constitution]], Article VI). The UN Charter is a treaty ratified by the US, which forbids member states, including the US, from attacking fellow member states, including Iraq, except in two carefully circumscribed situations (see [[UN Charter]]).\n\n==Aftermath==\nAfter the invasion of Iraq, the [[Iraq Survey Group]], headed by [[David Kay]] was formed to find the alleged weapons of mass destruction. Apart from a small quantity of degraded pre-1991 shells, nothing was found.<ref>\n{{cite web |last=Hanley |first=Charles J. |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2005-09-02-WMD-indepth_x.htm |title=Piecing together the story of the weapons that weren't |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=2005-09-06 |accessdate=2013-06-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925111915/http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2005-09-02-WMD-indepth_x.htm |archive-date=2012-09-25 |url-status=live }}\n</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[United Nations actions regarding Iraq]]\n* [[Iraq disarmament crisis timeline 1990-1996]], [[Iraq disarmament crisis timeline 1997-2000|1997-2000]], [[Iraq disarmament crisis timeline 2001-2003|2001-2003]]\n* [[Blair's tests for Iraq Disarmament]]\n* [[Support and opposition for the U.S. plan to invade Iraq]]\n* [[Disarmament of Libya]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2857347.stm UK Attorney General's Iraq response] - BBC News\n* [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1915996.stm Blair - \"We are ready to act on Iraq\"] - BBC News\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20030316065557/http://slate.msn.com/id/2079678/ Bully Bush] - Slate Magazine\n* [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A59403-2003Mar7.html Some Evidence on Iraq Called Fake] - Washington Post\n* [http://www.iiss.org/news-more.php?itemID=88 Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction: A Net Assessment] - International Institute for Strategic Studies\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081130173110/http://www.wsws.org/category/me-iraq.shtml News & Analysis: Iraq] - World Socialist Web Site\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20021124113736/http://www.washtimes.com/world/20020816-17858616.htm Rice makes case against Iraq to Britain] -  Washington Times\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20030227102603/http://www.counterpunch.com/leopold02192003.html The Origins of the Bush Iraq War Plan] Counterpunch, February 19, 2003\n* [https://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2003/10/ma_273_01.html The Thirty Year Itch] - Mother Jones\n* [http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110003156 When Will Americans Come?] - Wall Street Journal\n* [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2003/03/02/IN123519.DTL  Who Armed Iraq?] - San Francisco Chronicle\n* [http://www.truthaboutwar.org/ Examines Reasons for War] - American Liberty Foundation\n* [https://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,914020,00.html Law unto themselves] - Guardian\n{{Iraq War}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Iraq Disarmament Crisis}}\n[[Category:Iraq and weapons of mass destruction]]\n[[Category:History of the foreign relations of the United States]]\n[[Category:Iraq\u2013United States relations]]\n[[Category:Iraq\u2013United Kingdom relations]]\n[[Category:Military disbanding and disarmament]]\n", "text_old": "{{redirects here|Iraq crisis|the Iraq Crisis that began in 2011|Iraqi insurgency (2011\u2013present)}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{Refimprove|date=September 2007}}\n{{Cleanup-rewrite|date=May 2009}}\n}}\n\n[[File:Powell-anthrax-vial.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Colin Powell]] holding a model vial of [[anthrax]] while giving a presentation to the [[United Nations Security Council]]]]\n[[File:WeaponsInspector.JPG|thumb|right|300px|A UN weapons inspector in Iraq.]]\n\nThe '''Iraq disarmament crisis''' was claimed as one of primary issues that led to the [[Multi-National Force \u2013 Iraq|multinational]] [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion]] of [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]] on 20 March 2003. Since the 1980s, Iraq was widely assumed to have been producing and extensively running the programs of [[Iraqi biological weapons program|biological]], [[Iraqi chemical weapons program|chemical]] and [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear weapons]].

September 2003\n</ref> The disarmament issue remained tense throughout the [[Iraq disarmament timeline 1990\u20132003|1990s]] with U.S. at the UN, repeatedly demanding Iraq to allow inspections teams to its facilities. Finally, this disarmament crises reached to its climax in [[Iraq disarmament crisis timeline 2001-2003|2002-2003]], when [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]] demanded a complete end to what he alleged was Iraqi production of [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]], and reasoned with [[President of Iraq|Iraqi President]] [[Saddam Hussein]] to comply with [[List of United Nations Security Council resolutions concerning Iraq|UN Resolutions]] requiring [[UN weapons inspectors]] unfettered access to areas those inspectors thought might have weapons production facilities.\n\nSince the [[Gulf War]] in 1991, Iraq had been [[United Nations actions regarding Iraq|restricted]] by the [[United Nations]] (UN) from developing or possessing such weapons. It was also required to permit inspections to confirm Iraqi compliance. Bush repeatedly backed demands for unfettered inspection and disarmament with threats of invasion. On 20 March 2003, a [[Multinational force in Iraq|multinational alliance]] containing the armed forces of the [[United States armed forces|United States]] and [[British forces|United Kingdom]] launched an [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion]] of Iraq in 2003. After the [[withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq]] in 2011, a number of [[failed Iraqi peace initiatives]] were revealed.\n\n==Background==\nIn the decade following the 1991 Gulf War, the [[United Nations]] passed 16 [[United Nations Security Council Resolution|Security Council resolutions]] calling for the complete elimination of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. [[United Nations member states|Member states]] communicated their frustration over the years that Iraq was impeding the work of the [[United Nations Special Commission|special commission]] and failing to take seriously its disarmament obligations. Iraqi security forces had on several occasions physically prevented weapons inspectors from doing their job and in at least one case, took documents away from them.\n\nOn 29 September 1998, the [[United States Congress]] passed the ''[[Iraq Liberation Act]]'' supporting the efforts of [[Iraqi anti-Saddam groups|Iraqi opposition groups]] to remove Saddam Hussein from office. The Act was signed by President Clinton on 31 October 1998. On the same day, Iraq announced it would no longer cooperate with United Nations weapons inspectors.\n\nThe UN, under [[Kofi Annan]], brokered a deal wherein Iraq would allow weapons inspectors back into the country. Iraq ceased cooperating with inspectors only days later. The inspectors left the country in December. Inspectors returned the following year as part of The [[United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission]] (UNMOVIC).\n\n[[Paul Wolfowitz]], the military analyst for the [[United States Department of Defense]] under [[Ronald Reagan]], had formulated a new [[United States foreign policy|foreign policy]] with regard to Iraq and other \"potential aggressor states\", dismissing \"containment\" in favor of \"[[Preemptive war|preemption]]\", with the goal of striking first to eliminate threats.\n\nThis policy was short-lived, however, and Clinton, along with [[George H. W. Bush]], [[Colin Powell]], and other former Bush administration officials, dismissed calls for preemption in favor of continued containment. This was the policy of George W. Bush as well for his first several months in office. The [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] brought to life Wolfowitz's and other \"hawks'\" advocacy for [[pre-emptive war|preemptive action]]; Iraq was widely agreed to be a likely subject of this new policy. Powell continued to support the philosophy behind containment.\n\nFollowing the Gulf War, the [[Iraqi Army]] was reduced to 23 divisions with a total of about 375,000 troops. The [[Iraqi Air Force]] was reduced to less than 300 aircraft. The [[Iraqi Navy]] was almost completely destroyed, and its few remaining operational vessels were in a poor state of repair, the crews were estimated to be in a poor state of readiness, and its capabilities were reduced to that of limited mining and raiding missions.<ref>\n{{cite web |author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/navy.htm |title=Iraqi Navy |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |accessdate=2013-06-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130401124247/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/navy.htm |archive-date=2013-04-01 |url-status=live }}\n</ref> Any rebuilding that was done went into the [[Republican Guard (Iraq)|Republican Guard]], and the formation of the [[Special Republican Guard]].\n\n==2002\u20132003==\n[[File:Powell UN Iraq presentation, alleged Mobile Production Facilities.jpg|thumb|300px|Diagram of alleged Mobile Production Facility For Biological Agents, presented by [[Colin Powell]] before the [[United Nations]].]]\n\n{{Main|United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441}}\n{{Expand section|date=September 2007}}\nDuring late 2002 and into 2003, the [[United States government]] continued to call for \"[[regime change]]\" in [[Iraq]] and threatened to use military force to overthrow the Iraqi government unless Iraq rid itself of all [[weapons of mass destruction]] (WMD) it supposedly possessed and convinced the UN that it had done so.\n\nUS diplomatic pressure to bring Iraq to compliance quickly created a diplomatic crisis in the UN, where some members were in agreement with the U.S. position, while others dissented, notably the permanent Security Council members [[France]], [[Russia]] and the [[People's Republic of China]], and fellow [[NATO]] members [[Germany]] and [[Belgium]].\n\nThe [[Presidency of George W.

These two instances were the [[Korean War]] and the [[1991 Gulf War]].\n\nThe United States does not recognize the jurisdiction of any international court over its citizens or military, holding that the [[United States Supreme Court]] is its final authority. One example of this policy is that the United States did not ratify the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) treaty, and on 6 May 2002 it informed the UN that it has no intention to do so.\n\nAs of 24 February 2005 neither Iraq nor the United States have ratified the ICC treaty, and therefore neither the US attack on Iraq nor subsequent actions in Iraq fall under the jurisdiction of the ICC. The actions of signatories such as the United Kingdom and [[Spain]] could however fall under the ICC jurisdiction.\n\nOn March 17, 2003, [[Peter Goldsmith, Baron Goldsmith|Peter Goldsmith]], [[Attorney General for England and Wales]], set out his government's legal justification for an invasion of Iraq. He said that the 1990 [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 678|Security Council Resolution 678]] authorised force against Iraq, which was suspended but not terminated by the 1991 [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 687|Resolution 687]], which imposed continuing obligations on Iraq to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction. A material breach of resolution 687 would revive the authority to use force under resolution 678. In Resolution 1441 the Security Council determined that Iraq was in material breach of resolution 687 because it had not fully carried out its obligations to disarm, and in early 2003 sent teams of weapons inspectors to verify the [[facts on the ground]].\n\nMost member governments of the United Nations Security Council made clear that in their view, after resolution 1441 there was still no authorization for the use of force.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.worldpress.org/specials/iraq/ |title=International Law - War in Iraq - United Nations - Iraq |publisher=Worldpress.org |accessdate=2013-06-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730223344/http://worldpress.org/specials/iraq/ |archive-date=2013-07-30 |url-status=live }}\n</ref> However, the US and its allies argued that no resolution authorizing the invasion would be necessary anyway as they acted in self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter and by [[customary international law]]. The exercise of that right could not be banned by ceasefire. Since Iraq was not actively disarming themselves and hid WMDs from UN inspectors many times, the US and its allies had every right to assume that Iraq was holding WMDs. If the UN failed to force compliance, the US and the UK - as parties of the 1991 conflict - would invade Iraq without the UN, as they had already done in their intervention in the [[Kosovo War]]. [[Yoram Dinstein]] equates this to [[police officers]] cornering a convicted violent felon and saying \"put your hands on your head\", but instead he pulls something small and black (whether a gun or not) out of his pocket. Officers would have been justified in shooting him because he could have possessed something that is dangerous.<ref>{{cite book |title=War, Aggression and Self-Defence |pages=298\u2013299 |date=December 12, 2011 |author=Yoram Dinstein |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}</ref>\n\n===Authority under US Constitution===\nThe [[US Constitution|Constitution]] grants the power to declare war exclusively to the [[United States Congress]], but declares the President to be [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[US military]]. Because of this division of power, there has long been controversy regarding the authority of the President outside of a declared war. Nonetheless, of the many instances the United States has exercised force outside its borders, only five have been as part of a [[Declaration of war by the United States|declared war]].\n\nIn 1973, amid increasing domestic controversy about the [[Vietnam War]], Congress passed the [[War Powers Resolution]] to limit the ability of the president to undertake prolonged military action without Congressional authority. No president since has recognized the constitutionality of this act, and most legal scholars believe it would not survive a challenge in court.\n\nTo avoid initiating a crisis under the War Powers Resolution, the Bush administration sought explicit approval from the Congress to exercise force in Iraq. On October 9, 2002, the Congress passed the [[Iraq Resolution]] which explicitly authorized the President to use the Armed Forces of the United States as he determines to be necessary and appropriate. This raises the issue of whether or not Congress has the authority to delegate legislative power to the executive branch.  However, in a recent [[United States Supreme Court]] case, ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]],'' the Supreme Court ruled that the [[military commissions]] that the President had established, (and defended by arguing that he was given the power to create military courts by this resolution), were unconstitutional because they were unauthorized by Congress.\n\nThe Constitution also provides that international treaties ratified by the United States are among the highest law of the land ([[US Constitution]], Article VI). The UN Charter is a treaty ratified by the US, which forbids member states, including the US, from attacking fellow member states, including Iraq, except in two carefully circumscribed situations (see [[UN Charter]]).\n\n==Aftermath==\nAfter the invasion of Iraq, the [[Iraq Survey Group]], headed by [[David Kay]] was formed to find the alleged weapons of mass destruction.

However, for the remainder of the medieval period, the seat was not summoned to send an official. This changed with [[Henry VIII]]\u2019s grant of two Members of Parliament to the town, which is believed to have been incorporated as a [[borough status in the United Kingdom|borough]] in 1246, after the issue of a charter by [[Henry III of England|Henry III]]. At the close of the Middle Ages, in the [[Tudor period]], Wigan was one of four boroughs in Lancashire possessing Royal Charters; the others were [[Lancaster (UK Parliament constituency)|Lancaster]], [[Liverpool (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool]] and [[Preston (UK Parliament constituency)|Preston]].\n\nFollowing the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885]], single-member constituencies were imposed nationwide{{#tag:ref|Exceptions were the twenty-three borough constituencies, the [[City of London (UK Parliament constituency)|City of London]] and the Universities of [[Oxford University (UK Parliament constituency)|Oxford]], [[Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge]] and [[Dublin University (UK Parliament constituency)|Dublin]]|group= n}}, meaning the seat saw a reduction of the number of its members.\n\nThe death of [[Roger Stott]] in office in 1999 made him the fourth Wigan MP in the twentieth century to die in office (uniquely for a constituency in the United Kingdom); the others were [[John Parkinson (UK politician)|John Parkinson]], [[Ronald Williams (Labour politician)|Ronald Williams]] and [[William Foster (UK politician)|William Foster]].\n\n===Political history===\nWigan is considered a [[safe seat]] given that it has been held by the Labour Party since 1918, with solid majorities ranging from 1,018 votes (2.2%) in 1931 to 22,643 votes (51.7%) in 1997.\n\n===Prominent frontbenchers===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Member of Parliament!!Notability\n|-\n| [[William Ewart (British politician)|William Ewart]] || \n*Carried the Hanging in Chains Act of 1834, abolishing hanging in chains\n*Carried a bill in 1837 to abolish capital punishment for cattle-stealing and similar offences \n*Carried the [[Public Libraries Act 1850]], establishing free libraries supported out of public rates \n*Instrumental in the passage of the [[Weights and Measures Acts (UK)|Metric Weights and Measures Act 1864]]\n|-\n| [[Algernon Egerton]] || [[Parliamentary and Financial Secretary to the Admiralty|Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty]] (1874\u201380)\n|-\n| [[Alan Fitch]] || [[Vice-Chamberlain of the Household]] (1968\u201370)\n|-\n|[[Roger Stott]] || \n*Joint Chairman of the [[Council for Arab-British Understanding]] \n*[[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] to [[James Callaghan]] (1976\u201379)\n|-\n| [[Lisa Nandy]] || \n*[[Shadow Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] under [[Keir Starmer]] \n*[[2020 Labour Party leadership election]] contender who placed third.\n|}\n\n==Boundaries==\n'''1832\u20131918:''' The Township of Wigan.<ref>[[Parliamentary Boundaries Act 1832]]</ref>\n*In 1835 Wigan became a [[Municipal borough]], using the then current Parliamentary boundaries of the Township.<ref>[[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://maps.nls.uk/view/102344045|title=View: Lancashire XCIII (includes: Billinge and Winstanley; Orrell; Wigan.) - Ordnance Survey Six-inch England and Wales, 1842-1952|website=maps.nls.uk}}</ref>\n*In 1888 Wigan Municipal Borough became the [[County Borough of Wigan]] on the same boundaries.<ref>[[Local Government Act 1888]]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/lancs/vol4|title=A History of the County of Lancaster &#124; British History Online|website=www.british-history.ac.uk}}</ref>\n*In 1904 [[Pemberton Urban District]] was dissolved, with the area covered by it becoming part of the County Borough of Wigan.<ref>A History of the County of Lancaster: Volume 4</ref> However, for Parliamentary purposes, that area remained part of [[Ince (UK Parliament constituency)|South-West Lancashire, Ince Division]]<ref>[[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885]]</ref> until the Parliamentary boundaries were redefined in 1918.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\">[[Representation of the People Act 1918]]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://maps.nls.uk/view/101103203|title=View: Lancashire XCIII.SE (includes: Ashton in Makerfield; Ince in Makerfield; Wigan.) - Ordnance Survey Six-inch England and Wales, 1842-1952|website=maps.nls.uk}}</ref><ref>Local Administrative Units: Northern England, Frederic A.

places called upon to send a representative, then known as a \u2018burgess,\u2019 to the [[Model Parliament]].

An entity can be anything that is relevant to health care. It usually represents a disease or a [[pathogen]], but it can also be an isolated symptom or (developmental) anomaly of the body. There are also classes for reasons for contact with health services, social circumstances of the patient, and external causes of injury or death. The collection of all ICD-11 entities is called the '''Foundation Component'''. From this common core, various subsets can be derived; for example, the [[ICD-O]] is a derivative classification optimized for use in [[oncology]]. The primary derivative of the Foundation is called the '''ICD-11 MMS''', and it is this system that is commonly referred to as simply \"the ICD-11\".<ref name=\"Chute_(2018)\">{{Cite journal | first=Christopher G. | last=Chute | date=2018 | title=The rendering of human phenotype and rare diseases in ICD-11 | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5959961/ | journal=[[Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease]] | volume=41 | issue=3 | pages=563\u2013569 | doi=10.1007/s10545-018-0172-5 | quote=<small>The primary linearization, and the one most users will recognize and likely believe is \u201cthe ICD-11\u201d, is the Mortality and Morbidity Statistics (MMS) linearization.</small>}}</ref> MMS stands for Mortality and Morbidity Statistics.

The Pneumonia node in turn has various children, including Bacterial pneumonia (entity id: {{ICD11|1323682030|1323682030}}) and Viral pneumonia (entity id: {{ICD11|1024154490|1024154490}}).\n\nFrom the Foundation Component, a Linearization can be derived. A Linearization is a subset of entities from the Foundation, optimized for a particular field or situation. The website of the WHO compares this to a store of books. The Foundation is the entire store, from which a therapist can make a selection that fits their profession. For instance, an [[oncologist]] will need different 'books' than an [[ophthalmologist]].<ref name=\"Foundation_User_Guide\" />\n\nAs of 2020, the website of the WHO features six officially approved ICD-11 linearizations:<ref>{{Cite web | title=Download Area | url=https://icd.who.int/dev11/downloads/ | website=icd.who.int | publisher=World Health Organization}}</ref>\n\n* The ICD-11 MMS (or simply \"the ICD-11\");\n* The [[International Classification of Primary Care|Primary Care Low Resource Setting Linearization]];\n* The [[Dermatology]] Speciality Linearization;\n* The [[Neurology]] Speciality Linearization;\n* The [[Ophthalmology]] Speciality Linearization;\n* The [[International Classification of Diseases for Oncology]] (ICD-O).\n\nThe ICD-11 is part of the [[WHO-FIC]], a family of classifications that also includes the [[ICF]] and the [[ICHI]].<ref>{{Cite web | author=WHO | title=1.1.3 ICD in the context of WHO Family of International Classifications (WHO-FIC) | url=https://icd.who.int/icd11refguide/en/index.html#1.1.3ICDandWHO-FIC&#124;icd-in-the-context-of-who-family-of-international-classifications-whofic&#124;c1-1-3 | website=icd.who.int}}</ref>\n\n===ICD-11 MMS===\n[[File:ICD-11 MMS tiny portion.png|right|thumb|250px|A tiny portion of the ICD-11 MMS, as displayed in [https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en the ICD-11 Browser]. Note the gray nodes and the [[maroon]]-colored residual nodes.]]\nThe ICD-11 MMS is the primary derivative of the Foundation Component, and it is this taxonomy that is commonly referred to and recognized as \"the ICD-11\".<ref name=\"Chute_(2018)\" /> The abbreviation is variously written with or without a [[hyphen]] between 11 and MMS (\"ICD-11 MMS\" or \"ICD-11-MMS\"). MMS stands for Mortality and Morbidity Statistics.\n\nThe ICD-11 MMS takes the form of a [[hierarchy]] consisting of tens of thousands of entities. Entities can be chapters, blocks or categories. A chapter is a top level entity of the hierarchy; the MMS contains 28 of them (see [[#Chapters|Chapters]] section below). A block is used to group related categories or blocks together. A category can be anything that is relevant to health care. Every category has a unique, alphanumeric code called an ICD-11 code, or just ICD code. Chapters and blocks never have ICD-11 codes, and therefore cannot be diagnosed. An ICD-11 code is not the same as an entity id.\n\nUnlike the Foundation, all entities of a Linearization, including the MMS, must be mutually exclusive of each other and can only have a single parent.<ref name=\"Foundation_User_Guide\" /> Therefore, the hierarchy of the MMS contains gray nodes.<ref>See these screenshots: [https://archive.fo/tzqXX/d6dd919a3e1700f0f7c8ef70ef899e5ee5c826c4.png 1], [https://archive.fo/AzkYs/62fbae3bdd00a3fb409f6bba472d443663e01eae.png 2].</ref> These nodes appear as children in the hierarchy, but actually have a different parent node. They originally belong to a different block or chapter, but are also listed elsewhere because of overlap. For example, the aforementioned [[Pneumonia]] ({{ICD11|CA40}}) has two parents in the Foundation: \"Lung infections\" (location) and \"Certain infectious or parasitic diseases\" ([[etiology]]). In the MMS, Pneumonia is categorized in the \"Lung infections\", with a gray node in \"Certain infectious or parasitic diseases\". The same goes for [[injuries]], [[poisonings]], [[neoplasms]], and developmental anomalies, which can occur in almost any part of the body. They each have their own chapters, but their categories also have gray nodes in the chapters of the organs they affect. For instance, the [[blood cancers]], including all forms of [[leukemia]], are in the \"Neoplasms\" chapter, but they are also displayed as gray nodes in the chapter \"Diseases of the blood or blood-forming organs\".\n\nThe ICD-11 MMS also contains residual categories, or residual nodes. These are the 'Other specified' and 'Unspecified' categories, miscellaneous classes which can be used to code conditions that do not fit with any of the more specific MMS entities.<ref>{{Cite web | author=WHO | title=2.3.3 Residual categories \u2013 \u2018Other\u2019 and \u2018Unspecified\u2019 | url=https://icd.who.int/icd11refguide/en/index.html#2.03CodeAlso%7Cresidual-categories-other-and-unspecified%7Cc2-3-3 | website=ICD-11 Reference Guide}}</ref> In the ICD-11 Browser, residual nodes are displayed in a [[maroon]] color.<ref>[[Talk:ICD-11#Residual nodes are maroon-colored]]</ref> Residual categories are not in the Foundation, and therefore are the only classes with derivative entity ids: their ids are the same as their parent nodes, with \"/mms/otherspecified\" or \"/mms/unspecified\" tagged at the end. Their ICD codes always end with Y for 'Other specified' categories, or Z for 'Unspecified' categories (e.g. {{ICD11|1C4Y}} and {{ICD11|1C4Z}}).\n\n==Chapters==\nBelow is a list of all chapters of the ICD-11 MMS, the primary linearization of the Foundation Component.\n\n{| \n| {{ordered list|\n| [[ICD-11 MMS Chapter 1: Certain infectious or parasitic diseases|'''1A00\u20131H0Z''' &nbsp;Certain infectious or parasitic diseases]]\n| '''2A00\u20132F9Z''' &nbsp;Neoplasms\n| '''3A00\u20133C0Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the blood or blood-forming organs\n| '''4A00\u20134B4Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the immune system\n| '''5A00\u20135D46''' &nbsp;Endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases\n| '''6A00\u20136E8Z''' &nbsp;Mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorders\n| '''7A00\u20137B2Z''' &nbsp;Sleep-wake disorders\n| '''8A00\u20138E7Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the nervous system\n| '''9A00\u20139E1Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the visual system\n| '''AA00\u2013AC0Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the ear or mastoid process\n| '''BA00\u2013BE2Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the circulatory system\n| '''CA00\u2013CB7Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the respiratory system\n| '''DA00\u2013DE2Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the digestive system\n| '''EA00\u2013EM0Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the skin\n}}\n| {{ordered list|start=15\n| '''FA00\u2013FC0Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the musculoskeletal system or connective tissue\n| '''GA00\u2013GC8Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the genitourinary system\n| '''HA00\u2013HA8Z''' &nbsp;Conditions related to sexual health\n| '''JA00\u2013JB6Z''' &nbsp;Pregnancy, childbirth or the puerperium\n| '''KA00\u2013KD5Z''' &nbsp;Certain conditions originating in the perinatal period\n| '''LA00\u2013LD9Z''' &nbsp;Developmental anomalies\n| '''MA00\u2013MH2Y''' &nbsp;Symptoms, signs or clinical findings, not elsewhere classified\n| '''NA00\u2013NF2Z''' &nbsp;Injury, poisoning or certain other consequences of external causes\n| '''PA00\u2013PL2Z''' &nbsp;External causes of morbidity or mortality\n| '''QA00\u2013QF4Z''' &nbsp;Factors influencing health status or contact with health services\n| '''RA00\u2013RA26''' &nbsp;Codes for special purposes\n| '''SA00\u2013SJ3Z''' &nbsp;Supplementary Chapter Traditional Medicine Conditions - Module I\n| '''VA00\u2013VC50''' &nbsp;Supplementary section for functioning assessment\n| '''X...\u2013X...''' &nbsp;Extension Codes\n}}\n|}\n\nUnlike the [[ICD-10]], the ICD-11 MMS features no codes beginning with \"I\" or \"O\". This is to prevent confusion, because in many fonts, the capital letter L resembles the small letter l and the number 1 (one), and the capital letter O resembles a 0 (zero).\n\n==Changes==\nBelow is a summary of notable changes made to the ICD-11 compared to the ICD-10. One improvement of the ICD-11 MMS is a more flexible coding structure. In the ICD-10, every code starts with a letter and a two digit number (e.g. {{ICD10|P35}}). In a subcategory, this is followed by a dot and a single number (e.g. {{ICD10|P35.2}}), causing an artificial limitation of 10 subcategories per group (.0 to .9). In the ICD-11 MMS, this is resolved: after the 9, the digit continues with an A, then a B, and so on, theoretically allowing 36 subcategories (e.g. {{ICD11|KA62.A}}).<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2019)\">{{Cite journal | first=Geoffrey M. | last=Reed | display-authors=etal | date=2019 | title=Innovations and changes in the ICD\u201011 classification of mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders | url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wps.20611 | journal=[[World Psychiatry]] | volume=18 | issue=1 | doi=10.1002/wps.20611 | quote=<small>In the ICD\u201010, the number of groupings of disorders was artificially constrained by the decimal coding system used in the classification</small>}}</ref>\n\n===Mental disorders===\n\n====Overview====\nThe following mental disorders have been newly added to the ICD-11: [[Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B83}}), [[Binge eating disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B82}}), [[Bipolar type II disorder]] ({{ICD11|6A61}}), [[Body dysmorphic disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B21}}), [[Body integrity dysphoria]] ({{ICD11|6C21}}), [[Catatonia]] ({{ICD11|486722075|486722075}}), [[Complex post-traumatic stress disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B41}}), [[Excoriation disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B25.1}}), [[Frotteuristic disorder]] ({{ICD11|6D34}}), [[Gaming disorder]] ({{ICD11|6C51}}) [[Hoarding disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B24}}), [[Intermittent explosive disorder]] ({{ICD11|6C73}}), [[Olfactory reference disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B22}}), and [[Prolonged grief disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B42}}).<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2019)\" />\n\nOther notable changes include:<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2019)\" />\n\n* All [[personality disorders]] have been removed, and a dimensional model is used instead; see [[#Personality disorders|Personality disorders section]].\n* All subtypes of [[Schizophrenia]] (e.g. [[Paranoid schizophrenia|paranoid]], [[Disorganized schizophrenia|hebephrenic]], [[Catatonic schizophrenia|catatonic]]) have been removed. Instead, a dimensional model is used with the category Symptomatic manifestations of primary psychotic disorders ({{ICD11|6A25}}), which allows the coding for [[Positive symptoms]] ({{ICD11|6A25.0}}), [[Negative symptoms]] ({{ICD11|6A25.1}}), [[Depression (mood)|Depressive]] symptoms ({{ICD11|6A25.2}}), [[Manic]] symptoms ({{ICD11|6A25.3}}), [[:wikt:psychomotor|Psychomotor]] symptoms ({{ICD11|6A25.4}}), and [[Cognitive]] symptoms ({{ICD11|6A25.5}}).\n* [[Persistent mood disorders]] ({{ICD10|F34}}), which consists of [[Cyclothymia]] ({{ICD10|F34.0}}) and [[Dysthymia]] ({{ICD10|F34.1}}), have been deleted.\n* The ICD-10 differentiates between [[Phobic anxiety disorders]] ({{ICD10|F40}}), such as [[Agoraphobia]] ({{ICD10|F40.0}}), and Other anxiety disorders ({{ICD10|F41}}), such as [[Generalized anxiety disorder]] ({{ICD10|F41.1}}). The ICD-11 merges both groups together as [[Anxiety or fear-related disorders]] ({{ICD11|1336943699|1336943699}}).\n* All [[Pervasive developmental disorders]] ({{ICD10|F84}}) are merged into one category, [[Autism spectrum disorder]] ({{ICD11|6A02}}), except for [[Rett syndrome]], which is moved to the developmental anomalies chapter ({{ICD11|LD90.4}}).\n* [[Hyperkinetic disorders]] ({{ICD10|F90}}) is renamed [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] ({{ICD11|6A05}}), and a distinction in subtypes is made between [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder predominantly inattentive|predominantly inattentive]] ({{ICD11|6A05.0}}), predominantly hyperactive-impulsive ({{ICD11|6A05.1}}), and combined ({{ICD11|6A05.2}}). Hyperkinetic conduct disorder ({{ICD10|F90.1}}) has been removed.\n* [[Acute stress reaction]] ({{ICD10|F43.0}}) has been moved out of the mental disorder chapter, and placed in the chapter \"Factors influencing health status or contact with health services\" ({{ICD11|QE84}}). Thus, in the ICD-11, Acute stress reaction is no longer considered a mental disorder.<ref>{{Cite web | first=Jonathan D. | last=Raskin | title=What\u2019s New in the International Classification of Diseases? | url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/making-meaning/201807/what-s-new-in-the-international-classification-diseases | website=[[Psychology Today]] | date=25 July 2018 | archive-url=https://archive.fo/20200405171146/https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/making-meaning/201807/what-s-new-in-the-international-classification-diseases | archive-date=5 April 2020 | url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAsides from the updates made for the ICD-11, the WHO has also created an ICD-11 version of the ''Clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines'' (CDDG). A book of the same name was released in 1992<ref>[https://books.google.com/books/about/The_ICD_10_Classification_of_Mental_and.html?id=DFM0DgAAQBAJ Google Books entry on the CDDG]</ref> for the ICD-10, which was also known as the \"Blue Book\". It contains expanded definitions and diagnostic criteria for the mental disorders, whereas the ICD-10/-11 mental disorders chapters contain only short summaries. The ICD chapters are meant as a quick reference point, whereas the CDDG is meant for extensive diagnosing by health care professionals. To differentiate the old and the new version, the newest revision is called the ICD\u201011 CDDG. The WHO described the development of the ICD\u201011 CDDG as \"the most global, multilingual, multidisciplinary and participative revision process ever implemented for a [[classification of mental disorders]]\", involving nearly 15,000 clinicians from 155 countries.<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2019)\" /> As of April 2020, no release date of the ICD-11 CDDG has been given.\n\n====Personality disorders====\nThe [[personality disorder]] (PD) section has been completely revamped. All PDs have been merged into one: Personality disorder ({{ICD11|6D10}}), which can be coded as Mild ({{ICD11|6D10.0}}), Moderate ({{ICD11|6D10.1}}), Severe ({{ICD11|6D10.2}}), or severity unspecified ({{ICD11|6D10.Z}}). There is also an additional category called Personality difficulty ({{ICD11|QE50.7}}), which can be used to describe personality traits that are problematic, but do not rise to the level of a PD. Once a personality disorder or difficulty has been established, it may be specified by one or more Prominent personality traits or patterns ({{ICD11|6D11}}). The ICD-11 uses five trait domains: (1) [[Negative affectivity]] ({{ICD11|6D11.0}}); (2) Detachment ({{ICD11|6D11.1}}), (3) [[Dissociality]] ({{ICD11|6D11.2}}), (4) [[Disinhibition]] ({{ICD11|6D11.3}}), and (5) [[Anankastia]] ({{ICD11|6D11.4}}). Listed directly underneath is Borderline pattern ({{ICD11|6D11.5}}), a category similar to [[Borderline personality disorder]]. This is not a trait in itself but a combination of traits.\n\nDescribed as a clinical equivalent to the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five model]],[chance for change] the five-trait system addresses several problems of the old category-based system. Of the ten PDs in the ICD-10, two were used with a disproportionate high frequency: [[Borderline personality disorder|Emotionally unstable personality disorder, borderline type]] ({{ICD10|F60.3}}) and [[Antisocial personality disorder|Dissocial (antisocial) personality disorder]] ({{ICD10|F60.2}}).{{ref label|a|a}} Many categories overlapped, and individuals with severe disorders often met the requirements for multiple PDs, which Reed et al. (2019) described as \"artificial [[Comorbidity#Mental health|comorbidity]]\".<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2019)\" /> PD was therefore reconceptualized in terms of a general dimension of severity, focusing on five negative personality traits which a person can have to various degrees.<ref name=\"Reed_(2018)\">{{Cite journal | first=Geoffrey M. | last=Reed | date=2018 | title=Progress in developing a classification of personality disorders for ICD\u201011 | url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wps.20533 | journal=World Psychiatry | volume=17 | issue=2 | pages=227-229 | doi=10.1002/wps.20533 | quote=PD was conceptualized in terms of a general dimension of severity, continuous with normal personality variation and sub\u2010threshold personality difficulty.}}</ref>\n\nThere was considerable debate regarding this new dimensional model, with many believing that categorical diagnosing should not be abandoned. In particular, there was disagreement about the status of Borderline personality disorder. Reed (2018) wrote: \"Some research suggests that borderline PD is not an independently valid category, but rather a [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity#Sociology|heterogeneous]] marker for PD severity. Other researchers view borderline PD as a valid and distinct clinical entity, and claim that 50 years of research support the validity of the category. Many \u2013 though by no means all \u2013 clinicians appear to be aligned with the latter position. In the absence of more definitive data, there seemed to be little hope of accommodating these opposing views. However, the WHO took seriously the concerns being expressed that access to services for patients with borderline PD, which has increasingly been achieved in some countries based on arguments of treatment efficacy, might be seriously undermined.\"<ref name=\"Reed_(2018)\" /> Thus, the WHO believed the inclusion of a Borderline pattern category to be a \"pragmatic compromise\".<ref name=\"Watts_(2019)\">{{Cite journal | first=Jay | last=Watts | date=2019 | title=Problems with the ICD-11 classification of personality disorder | url=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(19)30127-0/fulltext | journal=[[The Lancet Psychiatry]] | volume=6 | issue=6 | pages=461-463 | doi=10.1016/S2215-0366(19)30127-0}}</ref>\n\nThe Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD) included near the end of the [[DSM-5]] is similar to the PD-system of the ICD-11, although much larger and more comprehensive.<ref>[[DSM-5]], [https://books.google.nl/books?id=-JivBAAAQBAJ&lpg=PT1241&pg=PT1212#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 761-781].</ref> It was considered for inclusion in the ICD-11, but the WHO decided against it because it was considered \"too complicated for implementation in most clinical settings around the world\",<ref name=\"Reed_(2018)\" /> since an explicit aim of the WHO was to develop a simple and efficient method that could also be used in low-resource settings.<ref name=\"Watts_(2019)\" />\n\n====Gaming disorder====\n[[Gaming disorder]] ({{ICD11|6C51}}) has been newly added to the ICD-11, and placed in the group \"Disorders due to addictive behaviours\", alongside [[Gambling disorder]] ({{ICD11|6C50}}). The latter was called Pathological gambling ({{ICD10|F63.0}}) in the ICD-10. Aside from Gaming disorder, the ICD-11 also features Hazardous gaming ({{ICD11|QE22}}), an ancillary category that can be used to identify problematic gaming which does not rise to the level of a disorder.\n\nAlthough a majority<ref name=\"Rumpf_et_al._(2018)\">{{Cite journal | first=Hans-J\u00fcrgen | last=Rumpf | display-authors=etal | date=2018 | title=Including gaming disorder in the ICD-11: The need to do so from a clinical and public health perspective | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326427203_Including_gaming_disorder_in_the_ICD-11_The_need_to_do_so_from_a_clinical_and_public_health_perspective_Commentary_on_A_weak_scientific_basis_for_gaming_disorder_Let_us_err_on_the_side_of_caution_van_ | journal=[[Journal of Behavioral Addictions]] | volume=7 | issue=3 | pages=556-561 |doi=10.1556/2006.7.2018.59 | quote=<small>Their arguments led to a series of commentaries, most of which were in favor of including the new diagnosis of GD in the ICD-11.</small>}}</ref> of scholars supported the inclusion of Gaming disorder (GD), a significant number did not.

As such, the sexual dysfunctions that were considered \"non-organic\" were included in the mental disorder chapter, while those that were considered \"organic\" were for the most part listed in the chapter on diseases of the [[genitourinary system]].

The ICD-11 replaces these with two main categories: [[Hypoactive sexual desire dysfunction]] ({{ICD11|HA00}}) and [[Sexual arousal dysfunction]] ({{ICD11|HA01}}). The latter has two subcategories: [[Female sexual arousal dysfunction]] ({{ICD11|HA01.0}}) and [[Male erectile dysfunction]] ({{ICD11|HA01.1}}). The difference between Hypoactive sexual desire dysfunction and Sexual arousal dysfunction is that in the former, there is a reduced or absent desire for sexual activity. In the latter, there is insufficient physical and emotional response to sexual activity, even though there still is a ''desire'' to engage in satisfying sex. The WHO acknowledged that there is an overlap between desire and arousal, but they are not the same. Management should focus on their distinct features. Furthermore, while there is no \"Male sexual arousal dysfunction\", the WHO has emphasized that Sexual arousal dysfunction can applied to both men and women, with female sexual dysfunction and male erectile problems being (sub)classified separately.<ref>Reed et al. (2016): <small>\"[T]he proposed ICD\u201011 category Hypoactive sexual desire dysfunction can be applied to both men and women, while Female sexual arousal dysfunction is classified separately. (\u2026) Although there is significant comorbidity between desire and arousal dysfunction, the overlap of these conditions does not mean that they are one and the same; research suggests that management should be targeted toward their distinct features.\"</small></ref>\n\nThe ICD-10 contains the categories [[Vaginismus]] ({{ICD10|N94.2}}), Nonorganic vaginismus ({{ICD10|F52.5}}), [[Dyspareunia]] ({{ICD10|N94.1}}), and Nonorganic dyspareunia ({{ICD10|F52.6}}). As the WHO aimed to steer away from the aforementioned \"outdated mind/body split\", the organic and nonorganic disorders were merged. Vaginismus has been reclassified as [[Sexual pain\u2010penetration disorder]] ({{ICD11|HA20}}). Dyspareunia ({{ICD11|GA12}}) has been retained. A related condition is [[Vulvodynia]], which is in the ICD-9 ({{ICD9|625.7}}), but not in the ICD-10. It has been re-added to the ICD-11 ({{ICD11|GA34.02}}).<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2016)\" />\n\nSexual dysfunctions and Sexual pain\u2010penetration disorder can be coded alongside a temporal qualifier, \"lifelong\" or \"acquired\", and a situational qualifier, \"general\" or \"situational\". Furthermore, the ICD-11 offers five aetiological qualifiers, or \"Associated with\u2026\" categories, to further specify the diagnosis.<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2016)\" /> For example, a woman who experiences sexual problems [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor#Sexual dysfunction|due to adverse effects of an SSRI antidepressant]] may be diagnosed with \"Female sexual arousal dysfunction, acquired, generalised\" ({{ICD11|HA01.02}}) combined with \"Associated with use of psychoactive substance or medication\" ({{ICD11|HA40.2}}).\n\n====Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder====\n[[Excessive sexual drive]] ({{ICD10|F52.7}}) from the ICD-10 has been reclassified as [[Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder]] (CSBD, {{ICD11|6C72}}) and listed under Impulse control disorders. The WHO was unwilling to overpathologize sexual behaviour, stating that having a high [[Libido|sexual drive]] is not necessarily a disorder, so long as these people do not exhibit impaired control over their behavior, significant distress, or impairment in functioning.<ref name=\"Kraus_et_al._(2018)\">{{Cite journal | first=Shane W. | last=Kraus | display-authors=etal | date=2018 | title=Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder in the ICD\u201011 | url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wps.20499 | journal=World Psychiatry | volume=17 | issue=1 | pages=109-110 | doi=10.1002/wps.20499}}</ref> Kraus et al.

Experiencing shame and guilt about sex is not a reliable indicator of a sex disorder, Kraus stated.<ref name=\"Kraus_et_al._(2018)\" />\n\nThere was debate on whether CSBD should be considered a (behavioral) addiction. It has been claimed that [[neuroimaging]] shows overlap between compulsive sexual behavior and substance-use disorder through common [[neurotransmitter]] systems.<ref>{{Cite journal | first1=Shane W. | last1=Kraus | first2=Valerie | last2=Voon | first3=Marc N. | last3=Potenza | date=2016 | title=Should compulsive sexual behavior be considered an addiction? | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4990495/ | journal=[[Addiction (journal)|Addiction]] | volume=111 | issue=12 | pages=2097\u20132106 | doi=10.1111/add.13297}}</ref> Nonetheless, it was ultimately decided to place the disorder in the Impulse control disorders group. Kraus et al. wrote that, for the ICD-11, \"a relatively conservative position has been recommended, recognizing that we do not yet have definitive information on whether the processes involved in the development and maintenance of the disorder [CSBD] are equivalent to those observed in substance use disorders, gambling and gaming\".<ref name=\"Kraus_et_al._(2018)\" />\n\n====Paraphilic disorders====\n[[Paraphilic disorders]], called Disorders of sexual preference in the ICD-10, have remained in the mental disorders chapter, although they have gray nodes in the sexual health chapter. The ICD-10 categories [[Fetishism]] ({{ICD10|F65.0}}) and [[Fetishistic transvestism]] ({{ICD10|F65.1}}) were removed because, if they don't cause distress or harm, they are not considered mental disorders. [[Frotteuristic disorder]] ({{ICD11|6D34}}) has been newly added.<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2016)\" />\n\n====Gender incongruence====\n[[Transgenderism]] and [[gender dysphoria]] are called Gender incongruence in the ICD-11. In the ICD-10, the group Gender identity disorders ({{ICD10|F64}}) consisted of three main categories: [[Transsexualism]] ({{ICD10|F64.0}}), [[Dual-role transvestism]] ({{ICD10|F64.1}}), and [[Gender identity disorder of childhood]] ({{ICD10|F64.2}}). In the ICD-11, Dual-role transvestism was deleted due to a lack of public health or clinical relevance.<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2016)\" /> Transsexualism was renamed Gender incongruence of adolescence or adulthood ({{ICD11|HA60}}), and Gender identity disorder of childhood was renamed Gender incongruence of childhood ({{ICD11|HA61}}).\n\nIn the ICD-10, the Gender identity disorders were placed in the mental disorders chapter, following what was customary at the time. Throughout the 20st century, both the ICD and the [[DSM]] approached transgenderism from a psychopathological position, as transgenderism presents a discrepancy between someone's biologically assigned sex and the sex they perceive to have. Since this causes mental distress, it was consequently considered a mental disorder, with distress or discomfort being a core diagnostic feature.<ref>{{Cite journal | first1=Jack | last1=Drescher | first2=Peggy | last2=Cohen-Kettenis | first3=Sam | last3=Winter | date=2012 | title=Minding the body: Situating gender identity diagnoses in the ICD-11 | journal=[[International Review of Psychiatry]] | volume=24 | issue=6 | pages=568\u2013577 | doi=10.3109/09540261.2012.741575 | quote=<small>Until the middle of the 20th century, with rare exceptions, transgender presentations were usually classified as psychopathological.</small>}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | first1=Peggy T | last1=Cohen-Kettenis | first2=Friedemann | last2=Pf\u00e4fflin | title=The DSM Diagnostic Criteria for Gender Identity Disorder in Adolescents and Adults | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38019925_The_DSM_Diagnostic_Criteria_for_Gender_Identity_Disorder_in_Adolescents_and_Adults | journal=[[Archives of Sexual Behavior]] | volume=39 | issue=2 | doi=10.1007/s10508-009-9562-y | quote=<small>The DSM has consistently approached gender problems from the position that a divergence between the assigned sex or \u201cthe\u201d physical sex (assuming that \u201cphysical sex\u201d is a one-dimensional construct) and \u201cthe\u201d psychological sex (gender) per se signals a psychiatric disorder.

An entity can be anything that is relevant to health care. It usually represents a disease or a [[pathogen]], but it can also be an isolated symptom or (developmental) anomaly of the body. There are also classes for reasons for contact with health services, social circumstances of the patient, and external causes of injury or death. The collection of all ICD-11 entities is called the '''Foundation Component'''. From this common core, various subsets can be derived; for example, the [[ICD-O]] is a derivative classification optimized for use in [[oncology]]. The primary derivative of the Foundation is called the '''ICD-11 MMS''', and it is this system that is commonly referred to as simply \"the ICD-11\".<ref name=\"Chute_(2018)\">{{Cite journal | first=Christopher G. | last=Chute | date=2018 | title=The rendering of human phenotype and rare diseases in ICD-11 | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5959961/ | journal=[[Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease]] | volume=41 | issue=3 | pages=563\u2013569 | doi=10.1007/s10545-018-0172-5 | quote=<small>The primary linearization, and the one most users will recognize and likely believe is \u201cthe ICD-11\u201d, is the Mortality and Morbidity Statistics (MMS) linearization.</small>}}</ref> MMS stands for Mortality and Morbidity Statistics.

Thus, the node Pneumonia (entity id: {{ICD11|142052508|142052508}}) has two parents: Lung infections (entity id: {{ICD11|915779102|915779102}}) and Certain infectious or parasitic diseases (entity id: {{ICD11|1435254666|1435254666}}). The Pneumonia node in turn has various children, including Bacterial pneumonia (entity id: {{ICD11|1323682030|1323682030}}) and Viral pneumonia (entity id: {{ICD11|1024154490|1024154490}}).\n\nFrom the Foundation Component, a Linearization can be derived. A Linearization is a subset of entities from the Foundation, optimized for a particular field or situation. The website of the WHO compares this to a store of books. The Foundation is the entire store, from which a therapist can make a selection that fits their profession. For instance, an [[oncologist]] will need different 'books' than an [[ophthalmologist]].<ref name=\"Foundation_User_Guide\" />\n\nAs of 2020, the website of the WHO features six officially approved ICD-11 linearizations:<ref>{{Cite web | title=Download Area | url=https://icd.who.int/dev11/downloads/ | website=icd.who.int | publisher=World Health Organization}}</ref>\n\n* The ICD-11 MMS (or simply \"the ICD-11\");\n* The [[International Classification of Primary Care|Primary Care Low Resource Setting Linearization]];\n* The [[Dermatology]] Speciality Linearization;\n* The [[Neurology]] Speciality Linearization;\n* The [[Ophthalmology]] Speciality Linearization;\n* The [[International Classification of Diseases for Oncology]] (ICD-O).\n\nThe ICD-11 is part of the [[WHO-FIC]], a family of classifications that also includes the [[ICF]] and the [[ICHI]].<ref>{{Cite web | author=WHO | title=1.1.3 ICD in the context of WHO Family of International Classifications (WHO-FIC) | url=https://icd.who.int/icd11refguide/en/index.html#1.1.3ICDandWHO-FIC&#124;icd-in-the-context-of-who-family-of-international-classifications-whofic&#124;c1-1-3 | website=icd.who.int}}</ref>\n\n===ICD-11 MMS===\n[[File:ICD-11 MMS tiny portion.png|right|thumb|250px|A tiny portion of the ICD-11 MMS, as displayed in [https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en the ICD-11 Browser]. Note the gray nodes and the [[maroon]]-colored residual nodes.]]\nThe ICD-11 MMS is the primary derivative of the Foundation Component, and it is this taxonomy that is commonly referred to and recognized as \"the ICD-11\".<ref name=\"Chute_(2018)\" /> The abbreviation is variously written with or without a [[hyphen]] between 11 and MMS (\"ICD-11 MMS\" or \"ICD-11-MMS\"). MMS stands for Mortality and Morbidity Statistics.\n\nThe ICD-11 MMS takes the form of a [[hierarchy]] consisting of tens of thousands of entities. Entities can be chapters, blocks or categories. A chapter is a top level entity of the hierarchy; the MMS contains 28 of them (see [[#Chapters|Chapters]] section below). A block is used to group related categories or blocks together. A category can be anything that is relevant to health care. Every category has a unique, alphanumeric code called an ICD-11 code, or just ICD code. Chapters and blocks never have ICD-11 codes, and therefore cannot be diagnosed. An ICD-11 code is not the same as an entity id.\n\nUnlike the Foundation, all entities of a Linearization, including the MMS, must be mutually exclusive of each other and can only have a single parent.<ref name=\"Foundation_User_Guide\" /> Therefore, the hierarchy of the MMS contains gray nodes.<ref>See these screenshots: [https://archive.fo/tzqXX/d6dd919a3e1700f0f7c8ef70ef899e5ee5c826c4.png 1], [https://archive.fo/AzkYs/62fbae3bdd00a3fb409f6bba472d443663e01eae.png 2].</ref> These nodes appear as children in the hierarchy, but actually have a different parent node. They originally belong to a different block or chapter, but are also listed elsewhere because of overlap. For example, the aforementioned [[Pneumonia]] ({{ICD11|CA40}}) has two parents in the Foundation: \"Lung infections\" (location) and \"Certain infectious or parasitic diseases\" ([[etiology]]). In the MMS, Pneumonia is categorized in the \"Lung infections\", with a gray node in \"Certain infectious or parasitic diseases\". The same goes for [[injuries]], [[poisonings]], [[neoplasms]], and developmental anomalies, which can occur in almost any part of the body. They each have their own chapters, but their categories also have gray nodes in the chapters of the organs they affect. For instance, the [[blood cancers]], including all forms of [[leukemia]], are in the \"Neoplasms\" chapter, but they are also displayed as gray nodes in the chapter \"Diseases of the blood or blood-forming organs\".\n\nThe ICD-11 MMS also contains residual categories, or residual nodes. These are the 'Other specified' and 'Unspecified' categories, miscellaneous classes which can be used to code conditions that do not fit with any of the more specific MMS entities.<ref>{{Cite web | author=WHO | title=2.3.3 Residual categories \u2013 \u2018Other\u2019 and \u2018Unspecified\u2019 | url=https://icd.who.int/icd11refguide/en/index.html#2.03CodeAlso%7Cresidual-categories-other-and-unspecified%7Cc2-3-3 | website=ICD-11 Reference Guide}}</ref> In the ICD-11 Browser, residual nodes are displayed in a [[maroon]] color.<ref>[[Talk:ICD-11#Residual nodes are maroon-colored]]</ref> Residual categories are not in the Foundation, and therefore are the only classes with derivative entity ids: their ids are the same as their parent nodes, with \"/mms/otherspecified\" or \"/mms/unspecified\" tagged at the end. Their ICD codes always end with Y for 'Other specified' categories, or Z for 'Unspecified' categories (e.g. {{ICD11|1C4Y}} and {{ICD11|1C4Z}}).\n\n==Chapters==\nBelow is a list of all chapters of the ICD-11 MMS, the primary linearization of the Foundation Component.\n\n{| \n| {{ordered list|\n| [[ICD-11 MMS Chapter 1: Certain infectious or parasitic diseases|'''1A00\u20131H0Z''' &nbsp;Certain infectious or parasitic diseases]]\n| '''2A00\u20132F9Z''' &nbsp;Neoplasms\n| '''3A00\u20133C0Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the blood or blood-forming organs\n| '''4A00\u20134B4Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the immune system\n| '''5A00\u20135D46''' &nbsp;Endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases\n| '''6A00\u20136E8Z''' &nbsp;Mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorders\n| '''7A00\u20137B2Z''' &nbsp;Sleep-wake disorders\n| '''8A00\u20138E7Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the nervous system\n| '''9A00\u20139E1Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the visual system\n| '''AA00\u2013AC0Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the ear or mastoid process\n| '''BA00\u2013BE2Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the circulatory system\n| '''CA00\u2013CB7Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the respiratory system\n| '''DA00\u2013DE2Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the digestive system\n| '''EA00\u2013EM0Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the skin\n}}\n| {{ordered list|start=15\n| '''FA00\u2013FC0Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the musculoskeletal system or connective tissue\n| '''GA00\u2013GC8Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the genitourinary system\n| '''HA00\u2013HA8Z''' &nbsp;Conditions related to sexual health\n| '''JA00\u2013JB6Z''' &nbsp;Pregnancy, childbirth or the puerperium\n| '''KA00\u2013KD5Z''' &nbsp;Certain conditions originating in the perinatal period\n| '''LA00\u2013LD9Z''' &nbsp;Developmental anomalies\n| '''MA00\u2013MH2Y''' &nbsp;Symptoms, signs or clinical findings, not elsewhere classified\n| '''NA00\u2013NF2Z''' &nbsp;Injury, poisoning or certain other consequences of external causes\n| '''PA00\u2013PL2Z''' &nbsp;External causes of morbidity or mortality\n| '''QA00\u2013QF4Z''' &nbsp;Factors influencing health status or contact with health services\n| '''RA00\u2013RA26''' &nbsp;Codes for special purposes\n| '''SA00\u2013SJ3Z''' &nbsp;Supplementary Chapter Traditional Medicine Conditions - Module I\n| '''VA00\u2013VC50''' &nbsp;Supplementary section for functioning assessment\n| '''X...\u2013X...''' &nbsp;Extension Codes\n}}\n|}\n\nUnlike the [[ICD-10]], the ICD-11 MMS features no codes beginning with \"I\" or \"O\". This is to prevent confusion, because in many fonts, the capital letter L resembles the small letter l and the number 1 (one), and the capital letter O resembles a 0 (zero).\n\n==Changes==\nBelow is a summary of notable changes made to the ICD-11 compared to the ICD-10. One improvement of the ICD-11 MMS is a more flexible coding structure. In the ICD-10, every code starts with a letter and a two digit number (e.g. {{ICD10|P35}}). In a subcategory, this is followed by a dot and a single number (e.g. {{ICD10|P35.2}}), causing an artificial limitation of 10 subcategories per group (.0 to .9). In the ICD-11 MMS, this is resolved: after the 9, the digit continues with an A, then a B, and so on, theoretically allowing 36 subcategories (e.g. {{ICD11|KA62.A}}).<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2019)\">{{Cite journal | first=Geoffrey M. | last=Reed | display-authors=etal | date=2019 | title=Innovations and changes in the ICD\u201011 classification of mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders | url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wps.20611 | journal=[[World Psychiatry]] | volume=18 | issue=1 | doi=10.1002/wps.20611 | quote=<small>In the ICD\u201010, the number of groupings of disorders was artificially constrained by the decimal coding system used in the classification</small>}}</ref>\n\n===Mental disorders===\n\n====Overview====\nThe following mental disorders have been newly added to the ICD-11: [[Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B83}}), [[Binge eating disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B82}}), [[Bipolar type II disorder]] ({{ICD11|6A61}}), [[Body dysmorphic disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B21}}), [[Body integrity dysphoria]] ({{ICD11|6C21}}), [[Catatonia]] ({{ICD11|486722075|486722075}}), [[Complex post-traumatic stress disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B41}}), [[Excoriation disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B25.1}}), [[Frotteuristic disorder]] ({{ICD11|6D34}}), [[Gaming disorder]] ({{ICD11|6C51}}) [[Hoarding disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B24}}), [[Intermittent explosive disorder]] ({{ICD11|6C73}}), [[Olfactory reference disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B22}}), and [[Prolonged grief disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B42}}).<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2019)\" />\n\nOther notable changes include:<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2019)\" />\n\n* All [[personality disorders]] have been removed, and a dimensional model is used instead; see [[#Personality disorders|Personality disorders section]].\n* All subtypes of [[Schizophrenia]] (e.g. [[Paranoid schizophrenia|paranoid]], [[Disorganized schizophrenia|hebephrenic]], [[Catatonic schizophrenia|catatonic]]) have been removed. Instead, a dimensional model is used with the category Symptomatic manifestations of primary psychotic disorders ({{ICD11|6A25}}), which allows the coding for [[Positive symptoms]] ({{ICD11|6A25.0}}), [[Negative symptoms]] ({{ICD11|6A25.1}}), [[Depression (mood)|Depressive]] symptoms ({{ICD11|6A25.2}}), [[Manic]] symptoms ({{ICD11|6A25.3}}), [[:wikt:psychomotor|Psychomotor]] symptoms ({{ICD11|6A25.4}}), and [[Cognitive]] symptoms ({{ICD11|6A25.5}}).\n* [[Persistent mood disorders]] ({{ICD10|F34}}), which consists of [[Cyclothymia]] ({{ICD10|F34.0}}) and [[Dysthymia]] ({{ICD10|F34.1}}), have been deleted.\n* The ICD-10 differentiates between [[Phobic anxiety disorders]] ({{ICD10|F40}}), such as [[Agoraphobia]] ({{ICD10|F40.0}}), and Other anxiety disorders ({{ICD10|F41}}), such as [[Generalized anxiety disorder]] ({{ICD10|F41.1}}).

Hyperkinetic conduct disorder ({{ICD10|F90.1}}) has been removed.\n* [[Acute stress reaction]] ({{ICD10|F43.0}}) has been moved out of the mental disorder chapter, and placed in the chapter \"Factors influencing health status or contact with health services\" ({{ICD11|QE84}}).

The ICD chapters are meant as a quick reference point, whereas the CDDG is meant for extensive diagnosing by health care professionals. To differentiate the old and the new version, the newest revision is called the ICD\u201011 CDDG. The WHO described the development of the ICD\u201011 CDDG as \"the most global, multilingual, multidisciplinary and participative revision process ever implemented for a [[classification of mental disorders]]\", involving nearly 15,000 clinicians from 155 countries.<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2019)\" /> As of April 2020, no release date of the ICD-11 CDDG has been given.\n\n====Personality disorders====\nThe [[personality disorder]] (PD) section has been completely revamped. All PDs have been merged into one: Personality disorder ({{ICD11|6D10}}), which can be coded as Mild ({{ICD11|6D10.0}}), Moderate ({{ICD11|6D10.1}}), Severe ({{ICD11|6D10.2}}), or severity unspecified ({{ICD11|6D10.Z}}). There is also an additional category called Personality difficulty ({{ICD11|QE50.7}}), which can be used to describe personality traits that are problematic, but do not rise to the level of a PD. Once a personality disorder or difficulty has been established, it may be specified by one or more Prominent personality traits or patterns ({{ICD11|6D11}}). The ICD-11 uses five trait domains: (1) [[Negative affectivity]] ({{ICD11|6D11.0}}); (2) Detachment ({{ICD11|6D11.1}}), (3) [[Dissociality]] ({{ICD11|6D11.2}}), (4) [[Disinhibition]] ({{ICD11|6D11.3}}), and (5) [[Anankastia]] ({{ICD11|6D11.4}}). Listed directly underneath is Borderline pattern ({{ICD11|6D11.5}}), a category similar to [[Borderline personality disorder]]. This is not a trait in itself but a combination of traits.\n\nDescribed as a clinical equivalent to the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five model]],[chance for change] the five-trait system addresses several problems of the old category-based system. Of the ten PDs in the ICD-10, two were used with a disproportionate high frequency: [[Borderline personality disorder|Emotionally unstable personality disorder, borderline type]] ({{ICD10|F60.3}}) and [[Antisocial personality disorder|Dissocial (antisocial) personality disorder]] ({{ICD10|F60.2}}).{{ref label|a|a}} Many categories overlapped, and individuals with severe disorders often met the requirements for multiple PDs, which Reed et al. (2019) described as \"artificial [[Comorbidity#Mental health|comorbidity]]\".<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2019)\" /> PD was therefore reconceptualized in terms of a general dimension of severity, focusing on five negative personality traits which a person can have to various degrees.<ref name=\"Reed_(2018)\">{{Cite journal | first=Geoffrey M. | last=Reed | date=2018 | title=Progress in developing a classification of personality disorders for ICD\u201011 | url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wps.20533 | journal=World Psychiatry | volume=17 | issue=2 | pages=227-229 | doi=10.1002/wps.20533 | quote=PD was conceptualized in terms of a general dimension of severity, continuous with normal personality variation and sub\u2010threshold personality difficulty.}}</ref>\n\nThere was considerable debate regarding this new dimensional model, with many believing that categorical diagnosing should not be abandoned. In particular, there was disagreement about the status of Borderline personality disorder. Reed (2018) wrote: \"Some research suggests that borderline PD is not an independently valid category, but rather a [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity#Sociology|heterogeneous]] marker for PD severity. Other researchers view borderline PD as a valid and distinct clinical entity, and claim that 50 years of research support the validity of the category. Many \u2013 though by no means all \u2013 clinicians appear to be aligned with the latter position. In the absence of more definitive data, there seemed to be little hope of accommodating these opposing views. However, the WHO took seriously the concerns being expressed that access to services for patients with borderline PD, which has increasingly been achieved in some countries based on arguments of treatment efficacy, might be seriously undermined.\"<ref name=\"Reed_(2018)\" /> Thus, the WHO believed the inclusion of a Borderline pattern category to be a \"pragmatic compromise\".<ref name=\"Watts_(2019)\">{{Cite journal | first=Jay | last=Watts | date=2019 | title=Problems with the ICD-11 classification of personality disorder | url=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(19)30127-0/fulltext | journal=[[The Lancet Psychiatry]] | volume=6 | issue=6 | pages=461-463 | doi=10.1016/S2215-0366(19)30127-0}}</ref>\n\nThe Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD) included near the end of the [[DSM-5]] is similar to the PD-system of the ICD-11, although much larger and more comprehensive.<ref>[[DSM-5]], [https://books.google.nl/books?id=-JivBAAAQBAJ&lpg=PT1241&pg=PT1212#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 761-781].</ref> It was considered for inclusion in the ICD-11, but the WHO decided against it because it was considered \"too complicated for implementation in most clinical settings around the world\",<ref name=\"Reed_(2018)\" /> since an explicit aim of the WHO was to develop a simple and efficient method that could also be used in low-resource settings.<ref name=\"Watts_(2019)\" />\n\n====Gaming disorder====\n[[Gaming disorder]] ({{ICD11|6C51}}) has been newly added to the ICD-11, and placed in the group \"Disorders due to addictive behaviours\", alongside [[Gambling disorder]] ({{ICD11|6C50}}). The latter was called Pathological gambling ({{ICD10|F63.0}}) in the ICD-10. Aside from Gaming disorder, the ICD-11 also features Hazardous gaming ({{ICD11|QE22}}), an ancillary category that can be used to identify problematic gaming which does not rise to the level of a disorder.\n\nAlthough a majority<ref name=\"Rumpf_et_al._(2018)\">{{Cite journal | first=Hans-J\u00fcrgen | last=Rumpf | display-authors=etal | date=2018 | title=Including gaming disorder in the ICD-11: The need to do so from a clinical and public health perspective | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326427203_Including_gaming_disorder_in_the_ICD-11_The_need_to_do_so_from_a_clinical_and_public_health_perspective_Commentary_on_A_weak_scientific_basis_for_gaming_disorder_Let_us_err_on_the_side_of_caution_van_ | journal=[[Journal of Behavioral Addictions]] | volume=7 | issue=3 | pages=556-561 |doi=10.1556/2006.7.2018.59 | quote=<small>Their arguments led to a series of commentaries, most of which were in favor of including the new diagnosis of GD in the ICD-11.</small>}}</ref> of scholars supported the inclusion of Gaming disorder (GD), a significant number did not.

They agreed that GD could be a coping strategy for an underlying disorder, but that in this debate, \"[[Comorbidity#Mental health|comorbidity]] is more often the rule than the exception\". For example, a person can have an [[Alcoholism|alcohol dependence]] due to [[PTSD]]. In clinical practice, ''both'' disorders need to be diagnosed and treated. Rumpf et al. also warned that the lack of a GD category might jeopardize insurance reimbursement of treatments.<ref>Rumpf et al. (2018): <small>\"The argument of potential stigmatization is not speci\ufb01c to GD but relates to many other well-established mental disorders.

The ICD-11 replaces these with two main categories: [[Hypoactive sexual desire dysfunction]] ({{ICD11|HA00}}) and [[Sexual arousal dysfunction]] ({{ICD11|HA01}}). The latter has two subcategories: [[Female sexual arousal dysfunction]] ({{ICD11|HA01.0}}) and [[Male erectile dysfunction]] ({{ICD11|HA01.1}}). The difference between Hypoactive sexual desire dysfunction and Sexual arousal dysfunction is that in the former, there is a reduced or absent desire for sexual activity. In the latter, there is insufficient physical and emotional response to sexual activity, even though there still is a ''desire'' to engage in satisfying sex. The WHO acknowledged that there is an overlap between desire and arousal, but they are not the same. Management should focus on their distinct features. Furthermore, while there is no \"Male sexual arousal dysfunction\", the WHO has emphasized that Sexual arousal dysfunction can applied to both men and women, with female sexual dysfunction and male erectile problems being (sub)classified separately.<ref>Reed et al. (2016): <small>\"[T]he proposed ICD\u201011 category Hypoactive sexual desire dysfunction can be applied to both men and women, while Female sexual arousal dysfunction is classified separately.

As the WHO aimed to steer away from the aforementioned \"outdated mind/body split\", the organic and nonorganic disorders were merged. Vaginismus has been reclassified as [[Sexual pain\u2010penetration disorder]] ({{ICD11|HA20}}). Dyspareunia ({{ICD11|GA12}}) has been retained. A related condition is [[Vulvodynia]], which is in the ICD-9 ({{ICD9|625.7}}), but not in the ICD-10.

Furthermore, the ICD-11 offers five aetiological qualifiers, or \"Associated with\u2026\" categories, to further specify the diagnosis.<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2016)\" /> For example, a woman who experiences sexual problems [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor#Sexual dysfunction|due to adverse effects of an SSRI antidepressant]] may be diagnosed with \"Female sexual arousal dysfunction, acquired, generalised\" ({{ICD11|HA01.02}}) combined with \"Associated with use of psychoactive substance or medication\" ({{ICD11|HA40.2}}).\n\n====Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder====\n[[Excessive sexual drive]] ({{ICD10|F52.7}}) from the ICD-10 has been reclassified as [[Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder]] (CSBD, {{ICD11|6C72}}) and listed under Impulse control disorders. The WHO was unwilling to overpathologize sexual behaviour, stating that having a high [[Libido|sexual drive]] is not necessarily a disorder, so long as these people do not exhibit impaired control over their behavior, significant distress, or impairment in functioning.<ref name=\"Kraus_et_al._(2018)\">{{Cite journal | first=Shane W. | last=Kraus | display-authors=etal | date=2018 | title=Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder in the ICD\u201011 | url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wps.20499 | journal=World Psychiatry | volume=17 | issue=1 | pages=109-110 | doi=10.1002/wps.20499}}</ref> Kraus et al.

Kraus et al. wrote that, for the ICD-11, \"a relatively conservative position has been recommended, recognizing that we do not yet have definitive information on whether the processes involved in the development and maintenance of the disorder [CSBD] are equivalent to those observed in substance use disorders, gambling and gaming\".<ref name=\"Kraus_et_al._(2018)\" />\n\n====Paraphilic disorders====\n[[Paraphilic disorders]], called Disorders of sexual preference in the ICD-10, have remained in the mental disorders chapter, although they have gray nodes in the sexual health chapter. The ICD-10 categories [[Fetishism]] ({{ICD10|F65.0}}) and [[Fetishistic transvestism]] ({{ICD10|F65.1}}) were removed because, if they don't cause distress or harm, they are not considered mental disorders. [[Frotteuristic disorder]] ({{ICD11|6D34}}) has been newly added.<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2016)\" />\n\n====Gender incongruence====\n[[Transgenderism]] and [[gender dysphoria]] are called Gender incongruence in the ICD-11. In the ICD-10, the group Gender identity disorders ({{ICD10|F64}}) consisted of three main categories: [[Transsexualism]] ({{ICD10|F64.0}}), [[Dual-role transvestism]] ({{ICD10|F64.1}}), and [[Gender identity disorder of childhood]] ({{ICD10|F64.2}}). In the ICD-11, Dual-role transvestism was deleted due to a lack of public health or clinical relevance.<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2016)\" /> Transsexualism was renamed Gender incongruence of adolescence or adulthood ({{ICD11|HA60}}), and Gender identity disorder of childhood was renamed Gender incongruence of childhood ({{ICD11|HA61}}).\n\nIn the ICD-10, the Gender identity disorders were placed in the mental disorders chapter, following what was customary at the time. Throughout the 20st century, both the ICD and the [[DSM]] approached transgenderism from a psychopathological position, as transgenderism presents a discrepancy between someone's biologically assigned sex and the sex they perceive to have. Since this causes mental distress, it was consequently considered a mental disorder, with distress or discomfort being a core diagnostic feature.<ref>{{Cite journal | first1=Jack | last1=Drescher | first2=Peggy | last2=Cohen-Kettenis | first3=Sam | last3=Winter | date=2012 | title=Minding the body: Situating gender identity diagnoses in the ICD-11 | journal=[[International Review of Psychiatry]] | volume=24 | issue=6 | pages=568\u2013577 | doi=10.3109/09540261.2012.741575 | quote=<small>Until the middle of the 20th century, with rare exceptions, transgender presentations were usually classified as psychopathological.</small>}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | first1=Peggy T | last1=Cohen-Kettenis | first2=Friedemann | last2=Pf\u00e4fflin | title=The DSM Diagnostic Criteria for Gender Identity Disorder in Adolescents and Adults | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38019925_The_DSM_Diagnostic_Criteria_for_Gender_Identity_Disorder_in_Adolescents_and_Adults | journal=[[Archives of Sexual Behavior]] | volume=39 | issue=2 | doi=10.1007/s10508-009-9562-y | quote=<small>The DSM has consistently approached gender problems from the position that a divergence between the assigned sex or \u201cthe\u201d physical sex (assuming that \u201cphysical sex\u201d is a one-dimensional construct) and \u201cthe\u201d psychological sex (gender) per se signals a psychiatric disorder.

Croxton]], part of the force participating in [[Wilson's Raid]]. The Battle of Munford and a minor action at Hendersonville, North Carolina on the same day were the last battles of the [[American Civil War]] in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War]] (east of the [[Mississippi River]]).\n\nThe [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] soldiers in the battle were described as convalescents, home guards, and pardoned deserters, while the Union cavalry was a veteran force armed with 7-shot [[Spencer repeating rifle|Spencer repeating carbines]]. The Confederate forces were commanded by General [[Benjamin Jefferson Hill]]. Confederate Lieutenant [[Lewis E. Parsons]] had two cannons which fired several rounds before they were overrun. The Union troops won the brief battle. Parsons was appointed provisional governor of Alabama in June after the war's end.\n\nThe Union and Confederate soldiers killed that day are described by author Rex Miller as the last to die in open combat by contending military forces.<ref>Miller, Rex, ''Croxton's Raid'', pp.80-81</ref>\n\n{{quote\n|THE LAST BATTLE.\n\nNumerous battles have been written up as \"the last fight of the rebellion.\" Without disputing in regard to the matter it is a fact, not generally known, that a battalion (the saber battalion) of the Second Michigan cavalry, under brevet Major Whittemore, charged the force under General Hill, near Talladega, Alabama, on the 23d of April, 1865, and was supported by the regiment and brigade, scattering the entire Confederate force and capturing the artillery, and many prisoners.

The PCjr was positioned as a complement to the very successful [[IBM Personal Computer]] (PC), competing with other [[home computer]]s such as the [[Apple II series]] and the [[Commodore 64]]. It retains the IBM PC's [[Intel 8088|8088]] [[CPU]] and [[BIOS]] interface, but provides enhanced graphics and sound capabilities over the original IBM PC, [[ROM cartridge]] slots, joystick ports, and an infrared wireless keyboard. The PCjr supports expansion via \"sidecar\" modules, which are attached to the side of the unit. New software such as ''[[King's Quest I]]'' showcased its [[PC gaming]] capabilities.\n\nDespite widespread anticipation, the PCjr's launch was unsuccessful. IBM's inexperience with the consumer market led to unclear positioning, with analysts believing that IBM was unsuccessful at justifying the PCjr's higher cost in comparison to competitors such as the Commodore 64 and Apple II. It is only partially [[IBM PC compatible|IBM compatible]], so compatibility with existing PC software such as the [[killer app]] [[Lotus 1-2-3]] was not guaranteed. The PCjr's [[chiclet keyboard]] was widely criticized for its poor quality, with critics stating that it was unsuitable for extended use such as word processing. The PCjr's expandability is limited, and it was initially offered with up to 128&nbsp;KB of RAM only, insufficient for many IBM PC programs.\n\nIn 1984, IBM offered free replacement keyboards with a more traditional design, and a new 512&nbsp;KB RAM upgrade. A large advertising campaign promoted the PCjr's compatibility with \"over 1000\" of the most popular IBM PC applications (including a new [[porting|port]] of Lotus 1-2-3), and new discounted pricing and other bundle offers. PCjr sales greatly increased, amazing observers that saw it as a failure.\n\nBy January 1985, when the discounts ended, IBM had sold 250,000 PCjr computers, with 200,000 in the fourth quarter of 1984 alone. Unable to sell the computer without discounts, IBM abruptly discontinued the PCjr in March 1985 and would not produce a home-oriented computer until the [[IBM PS/1|PS/1]] in 1990. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' described the PCjr as \"one of the biggest flops in the history of computing\", with critics comparing it to the [[Edsel|Ford Edsel]] and [[New Coke]]. Inexpensive and almost entirely compatible [[PC clone]]s became popular in 1985 including the [[Tandy 1000]]. The Tandy was much more successful than the PCjr it imitated, and PCjr's enhanced graphics and sound standards became known as \"[[Tandy Graphics Adapter|Tandy-compatible]]\".\n\n==Description==\n\n===Overview===\nAnnounced November 1, 1983, and first shipped in late January 1984,<ref name=\"sanger19840517\">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/17/business/ibm-s-problems-with-junior.html?pagewanted=all | title=I.B.M.'s Problems with Junior | accessdate=February 25, 2011 | author=Sanger, David E. | date=May 17, 1984 | newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref> the PCjr&mdash;nicknamed \"Peanut\" before its debut<ref name=\"time19840402\" />&mdash;came in two models: the '''4860-004''', with 64&nbsp;[[kilobyte|KB]] of memory, priced at US$669 ({{Inflation|US|669|1983|fmt=eq}}); and the '''4860-067''', with 128&nbsp;KB of memory and a 360&nbsp;KB 5.25-inch floppy disk drive, priced at US$1,269 ({{Inflation|US|1269|1983|fmt=eq}}). It was manufactured for IBM in [[Lewisburg, Tennessee]] by [[Teledyne Technologies|Teledyne]]. The PCjr promised a high degree of compatibility with the [[IBM PC]], which was already a popular business computer, in addition to offering built-in color graphics and 3 voice sound that was better than the standard [[PC speaker|PC-speaker]] sound and [[Color Graphics Adapter|color graphics]] of the standard IBM PC and compatibles of the day.  The PCjr was also the first PC compatible machine that was expressly designed to support [[page flipping]] for graphics operations. Since the PCjr uses system [[Random-access memory|RAM]] to store video content, and the location of this storage area can be changed, it can perform flicker-free animation and other effects that are difficult or impossible to produce on contemporary PC clones.\n\n====Video====\nUnlike the standard IBM PC, the PCjr has onboard video hardware. It is an improved subset of the [[Color/Graphics Adapter|CGA]] standard. The four CGA video modes (40x25 text, 80x25 text, 320x200x4, and 640x200x2 graphics) are supported in addition to three new graphics modes (160x200x16, 320x200x16, and 640x200x4). The 80x25 text mode, 320x200x16, and 640x200x4 modes are referred to in IBM's documentation as \"the high bandwidth modes\"; they are not supported on base models with only 64k of memory. The PCjr also has a composite video out and can support artifact colors on a TV or composite monitor much like the CGA cards, although the colors are slightly different. The PCjr also has palette registers which allow the colors to be redefined for any of the available 16\u2014this feature was retained in EGA and VGA cards. When the BIOS is used to set a video mode, it always sets up the PCjr palette table (i.e. the 16 palette registers) to emulate the CGA color palette for that mode.  Programs specifically written to use PCjr graphics can subsequently reprogram the palette table to use any colors desired.  Palette changes must be made during horizontal or vertical blanking periods of a video frame in order to avoid corrupting the display.  However, the provision of a vertical retrace interrupt (on IRQ5) simplifies this and also makes seamless page-flipping much easier. Although standard PC video cards had a flag to indicate that the vertical retrace was in progress, the PCjr added for the first time the ability to generate raster or VBLANK interrupts on IRQ 5. This allows the use of mixed video modes. The PCjr video subsystem also has a little-known graphics blink feature, which toggles the palette between the first and second groups of eight palette registers at the same rate used for the text blink feature, and a palette bit-masking feature that can be used to switch between palette subsets without reprogramming palette registers, by forcing one or more bits of each pixel value to zero before the value is used to look up the color in the palette table.\n\nVideo modes on the PCjr use varying amounts of system memory; 40x25 text mode uses 1k and 320x200x16 and 640x200x4 use 32k. Multiple text or graphics pages can be used as long as there is enough memory for them, thus the two largest modes allow only two graphics pages. The ability to page flip graphics modes answered one of the common criticisms of the CGA card, which had 16k of video memory and only supports multiple pages in text mode. Of the three new modes, 160x200x16 mode has the same layout as CGA graphics modes; the odd and even scanlines are stored in the first and second half of the video buffer, each half being 8k in size, and every four bits represents one pixel. The 320x200x16 and 640x200x4 modes have four blocks of scanlines; every four or two bits respectively represents a pixel.\n\nSince the PCjr uses the main system RAM for the video buffer, less memory is available for software than on a standard PC, which has its video memory in the A000h-BFFFh segments, above conventional memory.\n\n====Software====\nThe register mapping of the PCjr's video hardware is different from the standard CGA card, so software that tries to modify or read registers directly will not work\u2014the PCjr has a \"gate\" register in which the user writes the number of the video register to be accessed, followed by the value to be written into it.  Alteration of other CRTC registers cannot be assumed to produce the same results from the PCjr video system as from the CGA (and might damage the monitor).  (Programs for the CGA that manipulate the CRTC start address and that rely on address wrap-around above address 0xBC000 may not work correctly on the PCjr, because it always has a 32&nbsp;KB contiguous block of RAM in the video area from address 0xB8000 through 0xBFFFF.) The PCjr's video memory cannot be moved above 128k if expansion memory is added; some PC software that ran off of self-booting disks (mainly games) would not work on a PCjr if the software required more than 128k.\n\nPC DOS 2.10 was the minimum version of DOS required for the PCjr; IBM's OEM versions of MS-DOS supported the machine up to DOS 3.30, but memory expansion was required for DOS 3.20 and 3.30.\n\n====Hardware====\nThe PCjr display hardware consists primarily of two chips on the system board: a standard Motorola 6845 CRTC like the one used in the MDA and CGA adapters, and a custom IBM chip called the [[Video Gate Array]] (VGA)<ref name=\"vga\">VGA should not be confused with the later [[Video Graphics Array]] standard that IBM released with the [[PS/2]] line in 1987.</ref>{{r|nortonpcjrvideo19840124}}  The 6845 is responsible for the basic raster timing and video data address sequencing, and the Video Gate Array contains all the additional timing logic, the video data demultiplexing and color processing logic, and the programmable palette table logic, as well as the logic for multiplexing RAM access between the 8088 CPU and the video generation circuitry.  The 6845 CRTC and the VGA together are completely responsible for refreshing the internal DRAM of the PCjr (64 or 128&nbsp;KB), and this complicates the process of switching video modes on the PCjr.  (Resetting the VGA, which must be done during certain video mode switches, must be done by code not running from the internal RAM, and if the CRTC or the VGA is disabled for too long, the contents of the internal RAM can be lost.)  Additional external DRAM, in sidecar expansion modules, is refreshed separately, not by the CRTC and VGA.\n\n[[File:IBM PCB Jr Motherboard.jpg|thumb|IBM PC Jr Motherboard]]\n\n[[File:IBM PCB Jr Internal.jpg|thumb|IBM PC Jr Internal]]\n\n====Sound====\nThe PCjr's sound is provided by a [[Texas Instruments]] [[SN76496]] which can produce three square waves of varying amplitude and frequency along with a noise channel powered by a [[shift register]].<ref name=\"nortonpcjraudio19840124\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kSzKzjWHeVEC&lpg=PA61&pg=PA137#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=Sound Abilities: The PCjr | work=PC Magazine | date=January 24, 1984 | accessdate=October 23, 2013 | author=Norton, Peter | pages=137}}</ref> This device is sometimes also called a PSG (Programmable Sound Generator), and essentially equivalent devices were also used in the contemporary [[Sega Master System]] and the later [[Sega Genesis|Sega Mega Drive/Genesis]]. The PCjr design also allows for an analog sound source in an expansion-bus \"sidecar\" module, and software-controlled internal analog switch can select the source for the sound output from among the PC speaker, the SN76489, the cassette port, or the expansion-bus sound source.  Only one sound source can be selected at a time; the sources cannot be mixed.\n\n====Processor speed====\nThe PCjr's 4.77&nbsp;MHz [[Intel 8088]] [[CPU]] is faster than that of other computers that were aimed at the home market at the time,{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} though the stock PCjr usually does not run at the full rated 4.77&nbsp;MHz because access to the internal RAM is slowed by [[wait state]]s added by the Video Gate Array to synchronize shared access to RAM between the CPU and the video hardware. IBM claimed that an average of two wait states are added, but the designers of the Tandy 1000 claimed that six was a more accurate figure.<ref name=\"vose198412\">{{Cite magazine |last=Vose |first=G. Michael |date=December 1984 |title=The Tandy 1000 |url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1984-12/1984_12_BYTE_09-13_Communications#page/n99/mode/2up |magazine=BYTE |pages=98\u2013104}}</ref> However, this does not apply to programs or data located in ROM, including software on ROM cartridges plugged into the front of the PCjr, or located in additional RAM in a sidecar attachment; it only applies to the first 64 KB or 128 KB of RAM inside the system unit.  Therefore, under some circumstances the 8088 in the PCjr actually can run at the rated 4.77&nbsp;MHz.  The most common instances in which this maximum speed would be achieved are when running games or productivity applications from ROM cartridges; this would be a reason for PCjr users to prefer software in cartridges to software on disk media.  In fact, because the PCjr video subsystem continuously refreshes the system internal DRAM transparently, without disturbing the CPU, programs running from ROM on the PCjr will actually run slightly faster on the PCjr than on an IBM PC or XT.  This is because the PC and XT keep their DRAM refreshed by using a DMA channel to periodically request the bus from the CPU in order to perform a refresh cycle, whereas a program running from ROM on a PCjr will never be suspended for internal DRAM refresh cycles. To increase the system-speed of the IBM PCjr you can install a [[NEC V20]] instead of the 8088.\n\n====Wireless keyboard====\nThe detached wireless infrared keyboard promised a degree of convenience none of its competitors had, eliciting visions of word processing wirelessly from one's [[couch]] with the computer connected to a TV set as a display.{{r|hoffmann198403}}  For infrared wireless operation, it was powered by four common AA cells.  A keyboard cord option, that plugged into the keyboard with a modular 4-position telephone plug and into the back of the computer with a 6-pin (2x3) header connected, was also available for increased security and reliability. The cord also eliminated dependence on batteries; the keyboard IR receiver was automatically disabled when the keyboard cord was attached to the computer.\n\n===Differences from the IBM PC===\nWith a built-in [[RF modulator]], the PCjr can send video and audio to a television receiver; it also has an audio output jack to connect to an amplifier. The PCjr Color Display sold by IBM included an internal amplified speaker, being the only IBM monitor in the PC line to do so. [[IBM BASIC#IBM PCjr Cartridge BASIC|Cartridge BASIC]] enhances the standard IBM BASIC with commands to support the new video and audio functionality.<ref name=\"nortonpcjrvideo19840124\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kSzKzjWHeVEC&lpg=PA61&pg=PA128#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=Screening the PCjr's Color, Video, And Memory Options | work=PC Magazine | date=January 24, 1984 | access-date=October 23, 2013 | author=Norton, Peter | pages=128}}</ref>{{r|nortonpcjraudio19840124}} Two joystick ports are also evidence of IBM's goal for marketing the PCjr as a home-friendly machine to compete with popular home machines like the Commodore 64, the Atari home computers, and the Apple II line. Other than the [[Tandy 1000]], which was designed as an enhanced PCjr clone to directly compete with the PCjr, and [[PC1512|Amstrad IBM PC compatible]] lines a few years later, the dual built-in joystick ports introduced by the PCjr never became standard on IBM PC compatibles, and have not been seen since. However, the single 15-pin D-subminiature joystick port common on later PCs supports two two-axis, two-button joysticks like those supported by the PCjr, and the 15-pin port can be split out to two separate joystick ports with a passive Y-adapter cable.\n\nFurther reinforcing the \"home-friendly\" goal, the PCjr also introduced two [[ROM cartridge]] slots on the front of the unit, meant to load software quickly and easily. The cartridges are plugged in from the front, prompting the computer to automatically reboot and run the software. This is more [[Usability|user-friendly]] than other home computer systems, which must be powered off when a cartridge was removed or inserted and come with warnings about damage to the computer if this requirement is ignored. Loading and saving data from cartridge software is possible via the floppy drive. The cartridge BASIC for the PCjr, in particular, gives programmers the advantage of a real programming language always ready without taking up system memory, as it was firmware, with its own address space. Being stored in ROM the BASIC loads very quickly, not needing access to the floppy disk or other storage.\n\nCartridges can also replace the system BIOS and other firmware.<ref name=\"norton19840320\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1tFFnOMCvv4C&lpg=PA477&pg=PA111#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=Unearthing The PCjr's Secrets | work=PC Magazine | date=March 20, 1984 | access-date=October 24, 2013 | author=Norton, Peter | pages=111}}</ref> A number of patches from various vendors are included on a single \"combo-cartridge\", licensed and sold by PC Enterprises, to support add-on hardware, bypass certain limitations of design, and keep up with changing OS requirements.\n\nExpansions (such as additional parallel ports, serial ports, memory, etc.) to the PCjr are provided via add-on [[daisy chain (electrical engineering)|\"sidecars\" that attach to the side of the PCjr]]. Multiple expansions are stacked together, increasing the width of the machine.\n\nThe floppy controller on the PCjr had its I/O registers mapped into different ports than on the PC, since the PCjr also did not have DMA, the BIOS routines for handling floppy access were different and more complex than those on the PC. Software that tried to perform direct, low-level disk access (mainly utilities, but also the occasional game such as ''Dunzhin: Warrior of Ras'') would not work unless it was rewritten for the PCjr.\n\nThe internal floppy drive on the PCjr was a half-height [[Qume]] 5.25\" unit; IBM also used these drives in the PC Portable, but the PCjr units were specially equipped with a small fan to prevent overheating since the computer did not have a case fan.\n\nThe PCjr's video uses 32&nbsp;kB of RAM as [[shared graphics memory]], which prevents using additional memory with the built-in 128&nbsp;KB under DOS.{{r|norton19840320}}  The specific issue is that while additional external RAM can be added directly above the internal RAM, making a [[flat memory model|flat model]], if the display is used, its buffer must reside somewhere within the first 128&nbsp;KB of RAM (from where it is mirrored at address 0xB8000).  Stock MS-DOS is not prepared to work around the video buffer in low RAM, using RAM both below and above it.  Two obvious solutions exist: Use the additional memory as a [[RAM drive]], or not use the built-in 128&nbsp;KB.<ref name=\"norton19840626\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IGkuDrOYjOcC&lpg=PA407&pg=PA98#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=Adding to Junior's Memory | work=PC Magazine | date=June 26, 1984 | access-date=October 24, 2013 | author=Norton, Peter | pages=98}}</ref>  Another option would be to load a special DOS device driver or TSR, which would claim the RAM selected for use as the video buffer, causing DOS to load other drivers and programs above it.

The PCjr was positioned as a complement to the very successful [[IBM Personal Computer]] (PC), competing with other [[home computer]]s such as the [[Apple II series]] and the [[Commodore 64]]. It retains the IBM PC's [[Intel 8088|8088]] [[CPU]] and [[BIOS]] interface, but provides enhanced graphics and sound capabilities over the original IBM PC, [[ROM cartridge]] slots, joystick ports, and an infrared wireless keyboard. The PCjr supports expansion via \"sidecar\" modules, which are attached to the side of the unit. New software such as ''[[King's Quest I]]'' showcased its [[PC gaming]] capabilities.\n\nDespite widespread anticipation, the PCjr's launch was unsuccessful. IBM's inexperience with the consumer market led to unclear positioning, with analysts believing that IBM was unsuccessful at justifying the PCjr's higher cost in comparison to competitors such as the Commodore 64 and Apple II. It is only partially [[IBM PC compatible|IBM compatible]], so compatibility with existing PC software such as the [[killer app]] [[Lotus 1-2-3]] was not guaranteed. The PCjr's [[chiclet keyboard]] was widely criticized for its poor quality, with critics stating that it was unsuitable for extended use such as word processing. The PCjr's expandability is limited, and it was initially offered with up to 128&nbsp;KB of RAM only, insufficient for many IBM PC programs.\n\nIn 1984, IBM offered free replacement keyboards with a more traditional design, and a new 512&nbsp;KB RAM upgrade. A large advertising campaign promoted the PCjr's compatibility with \"over 1000\" of the most popular IBM PC applications (including a new [[porting|port]] of Lotus 1-2-3), and new discounted pricing and other bundle offers. PCjr sales greatly increased, amazing observers that saw it as a failure.\n\nBy January 1985, when the discounts ended, IBM had sold 250,000 PCjr computers, with 200,000 in the fourth quarter of 1984 alone. Unable to sell the computer without discounts, IBM abruptly discontinued the PCjr in March 1985 and would not produce a home-oriented computer until the [[IBM PS/1|PS/1]] in 1990. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' described the PCjr as \"one of the biggest flops in the history of computing\", with critics comparing it to the [[Edsel|Ford Edsel]] and [[New Coke]]. Inexpensive and almost entirely compatible [[PC clone]]s became popular in 1985 including the [[Tandy 1000]]. The Tandy was much more successful than the PCjr it imitated, and PCjr's enhanced graphics and sound standards became known as \"[[Tandy Graphics Adapter|Tandy-compatible]]\".\n\n==Description==\n\n===Overview===\nAnnounced November 1, 1983, and first shipped in late January 1984,<ref name=\"sanger19840517\">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/17/business/ibm-s-problems-with-junior.html?pagewanted=all | title=I.B.M.'s Problems with Junior | accessdate=February 25, 2011 | author=Sanger, David E. | date=May 17, 1984 | newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref> the PCjr&mdash;nicknamed \"Peanut\" before its debut<ref name=\"time19840402\" />&mdash;came in two models: the '''4860-004''', with 64&nbsp;[[kilobyte|KB]] of memory, priced at US$669 ({{Inflation|US|669|1983|fmt=eq}}); and the '''4860-067''', with 128&nbsp;KB of memory and a 360&nbsp;KB 5.25-inch floppy disk drive, priced at US$1,269 ({{Inflation|US|1269|1983|fmt=eq}}). It was manufactured for IBM in [[Lewisburg, Tennessee]] by [[Teledyne Technologies|Teledyne]]. The PCjr promised a high degree of compatibility with the [[IBM PC]], which was already a popular business computer, in addition to offering built-in color graphics and 3 voice sound that was better than the standard [[PC speaker|PC-speaker]] sound and [[Color Graphics Adapter|color graphics]] of the standard IBM PC and compatibles of the day.  The PCjr was also the first PC compatible machine that was expressly designed to support [[page flipping]] for graphics operations. Since the PCjr uses system [[Random-access memory|RAM]] to store video content, and the location of this storage area can be changed, it can perform flicker-free animation and other effects that are difficult or impossible to produce on contemporary PC clones.\n\n====Video====\nUnlike the standard IBM PC, the PCjr has onboard video hardware. It is an improved subset of the [[Color/Graphics Adapter|CGA]] standard. The four CGA video modes (40x25 text, 80x25 text, 320x200x4, and 640x200x2 graphics) are supported in addition to three new graphics modes (160x200x16, 320x200x16, and 640x200x4). The 80x25 text mode, 320x200x16, and 640x200x4 modes are referred to in IBM's documentation as \"the high bandwidth modes\"; they are not supported on base models with only 64k of memory. The PCjr also has a composite video out and can support artifact colors on a TV or composite monitor much like the CGA cards, although the colors are slightly different. The PCjr also has palette registers which allow the colors to be redefined for any of the available 16\u2014this feature was retained in EGA and VGA cards. When the BIOS is used to set a video mode, it always sets up the PCjr palette table (i.e. the 16 palette registers) to emulate the CGA color palette for that mode.  Programs specifically written to use PCjr graphics can subsequently reprogram the palette table to use any colors desired.  Palette changes must be made during horizontal or vertical blanking periods of a video frame in order to avoid corrupting the display.  However, the provision of a vertical retrace interrupt (on IRQ5) simplifies this and also makes seamless page-flipping much easier. Although standard PC video cards had a flag to indicate that the vertical retrace was in progress, the PCjr added for the first time the ability to generate raster or VBLANK interrupts on IRQ 5. This allows the use of mixed video modes. The PCjr video subsystem also has a little-known graphics blink feature, which toggles the palette between the first and second groups of eight palette registers at the same rate used for the text blink feature, and a palette bit-masking feature that can be used to switch between palette subsets without reprogramming palette registers, by forcing one or more bits of each pixel value to zero before the value is used to look up the color in the palette table.\n\nVideo modes on the PCjr use varying amounts of system memory; 40x25 text mode uses 1k and 320x200x16 and 640x200x4 use 32k. Multiple text or graphics pages can be used as long as there is enough memory for them, thus the two largest modes allow only two graphics pages. The ability to page flip graphics modes answered one of the common criticisms of the CGA card, which had 16k of video memory and only supports multiple pages in text mode. Of the three new modes, 160x200x16 mode has the same layout as CGA graphics modes; the odd and even scanlines are stored in the first and second half of the video buffer, each half being 8k in size, and every four bits represents one pixel. The 320x200x16 and 640x200x4 modes have four blocks of scanlines; every four or two bits respectively represents a pixel.\n\nSince the PCjr uses the main system RAM for the video buffer, less memory is available for software than on a standard PC, which has its video memory in the A000h-BFFFh segments, above conventional memory.\n\n====Software====\nThe register mapping of the PCjr's video hardware is different from the standard CGA card, so software that tries to modify or read registers directly will not work\u2014the PCjr has a \"gate\" register in which the user writes the number of the video register to be accessed, followed by the value to be written into it.  Alteration of other CRTC registers cannot be assumed to produce the same results from the PCjr video system as from the CGA (and might damage the monitor).  (Programs for the CGA that manipulate the CRTC start address and that rely on address wrap-around above address 0xBC000 may not work correctly on the PCjr, because it always has a 32&nbsp;KB contiguous block of RAM in the video area from address 0xB8000 through 0xBFFFF.) The PCjr's video memory cannot be moved above 128k if expansion memory is added; some PC software that ran off of self-booting disks (mainly games) would not work on a PCjr if the software required more than 128k.\n\nPC DOS 2.10 was the minimum version of DOS required for the PCjr; IBM's OEM versions of MS-DOS supported the machine up to DOS 3.30, but memory expansion was required for DOS 3.20 and 3.30.\n\n====Hardware====\nThe PCjr display hardware consists primarily of two chips on the system board: a standard Motorola 6845 CRTC like the one used in the MDA and CGA adapters, and a custom IBM chip called the [[Video Gate Array]] (VGA)<ref name=\"vga\">VGA should not be confused with the later [[Video Graphics Array]] standard that IBM released with the [[PS/2]] line in 1987.</ref>{{r|nortonpcjrvideo19840124}}  The 6845 is responsible for the basic raster timing and video data address sequencing, and the Video Gate Array contains all the additional timing logic, the video data demultiplexing and color processing logic, and the programmable palette table logic, as well as the logic for multiplexing RAM access between the 8088 CPU and the video generation circuitry.  The 6845 CRTC and the VGA together are completely responsible for refreshing the internal DRAM of the PCjr (64 or 128&nbsp;KB), and this complicates the process of switching video modes on the PCjr.  (Resetting the VGA, which must be done during certain video mode switches, must be done by code not running from the internal RAM, and if the CRTC or the VGA is disabled for too long, the contents of the internal RAM can be lost.)  Additional external DRAM, in sidecar expansion modules, is refreshed separately, not by the CRTC and VGA.\n\n[[File:IBM PCB Jr Motherboard.jpg|thumb|IBM PC Jr Motherboard]]\n\n[[File:IBM PCB Jr Internal.jpg|thumb|IBM PC Jr Internal]]\n\n====Sound====\nThe PCjr's sound is provided by a [[Texas Instruments]] [[SN76496]] which can produce three square waves of varying amplitude and frequency along with a noise channel powered by a [[shift register]].<ref name=\"nortonpcjraudio19840124\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kSzKzjWHeVEC&lpg=PA61&pg=PA137#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=Sound Abilities: The PCjr | work=PC Magazine | date=January 24, 1984 | accessdate=October 23, 2013 | author=Norton, Peter | pages=137}}</ref> This device is sometimes also called a PSG (Programmable Sound Generator), and essentially equivalent devices were also used in the contemporary [[Sega Master System]] and the later [[Sega Genesis|Sega Mega Drive/Genesis]]. The PCjr design also allows for an analog sound source in an expansion-bus \"sidecar\" module, and software-controlled internal analog switch can select the source for the sound output from among the PC speaker, the SN76489, the cassette port, or the expansion-bus sound source.  Only one sound source can be selected at a time; the sources cannot be mixed.\n\n====Processor speed====\nThe PCjr's 4.77&nbsp;MHz [[Intel 8088]] [[CPU]] is faster than that of other computers that were aimed at the home market at the time,{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} though the stock PCjr usually does not run at the full rated 4.77&nbsp;MHz because access to the internal RAM is slowed by [[wait state]]s added by the Video Gate Array to synchronize shared access to RAM between the CPU and the video hardware. IBM claimed that an average of two wait states are added, but the designers of the Tandy 1000 claimed that six was a more accurate figure.<ref name=\"vose198412\">{{Cite magazine |last=Vose |first=G. Michael |date=December 1984 |title=The Tandy 1000 |url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1984-12/1984_12_BYTE_09-13_Communications#page/n99/mode/2up |magazine=BYTE |pages=98\u2013104}}</ref> However, this does not apply to programs or data located in ROM, including software on ROM cartridges plugged into the front of the PCjr, or located in additional RAM in a sidecar attachment; it only applies to the first 64 KB or 128 KB of RAM inside the system unit.  Therefore, under some circumstances the 8088 in the PCjr actually can run at the rated 4.77&nbsp;MHz.  The most common instances in which this maximum speed would be achieved are when running games or productivity applications from ROM cartridges; this would be a reason for PCjr users to prefer software in cartridges to software on disk media.  In fact, because the PCjr video subsystem continuously refreshes the system internal DRAM transparently, without disturbing the CPU, programs running from ROM on the PCjr will actually run slightly faster on the PCjr than on an IBM PC or XT.  This is because the PC and XT keep their DRAM refreshed by using a DMA channel to periodically request the bus from the CPU in order to perform a refresh cycle, whereas a program running from ROM on a PCjr will never be suspended for internal DRAM refresh cycles. To increase the system-speed of the IBM PCjr you can install a [[NEC V20]] instead of the 8088.\n\n====Wireless keyboard====\nThe detached wireless infrared keyboard promised a degree of convenience none of its competitors had, eliciting visions of word processing wirelessly from one's [[couch]] with the computer connected to a TV set as a display.{{r|hoffmann198403}}  For infrared wireless operation, it was powered by four common AA cells.  A keyboard cord option, that plugged into the keyboard with a modular 4-position telephone plug and into the back of the computer with a 6-pin (2x3) header connected, was also available for increased security and reliability. The cord also eliminated dependence on batteries; the keyboard IR receiver was automatically disabled when the keyboard cord was attached to the computer.\n\n===Differences from the IBM PC===\nWith a built-in [[RF modulator]], the PCjr can send video and audio to a television receiver; it also has an audio output jack to connect to an amplifier. The PCjr Color Display sold by IBM included an internal amplified speaker, being the only IBM monitor in the PC line to do so. [[IBM BASIC#IBM PCjr Cartridge BASIC|Cartridge BASIC]] enhances the standard IBM BASIC with commands to support the new video and audio functionality.<ref name=\"nortonpcjrvideo19840124\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kSzKzjWHeVEC&lpg=PA61&pg=PA128#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=Screening the PCjr's Color, Video, And Memory Options | work=PC Magazine | date=January 24, 1984 | access-date=October 23, 2013 | author=Norton, Peter | pages=128}}</ref>{{r|nortonpcjraudio19840124}} Two joystick ports are also evidence of IBM's goal for marketing the PCjr as a home-friendly machine to compete with popular home machines like the Commodore 64, the Atari home computers, and the Apple II line. Other than the [[Tandy 1000]], which was designed as an enhanced PCjr clone to directly compete with the PCjr, and [[PC1512|Amstrad IBM PC compatible]] lines a few years later, the dual built-in joystick ports introduced by the PCjr never became standard on IBM PC compatibles, and have not been seen since. However, the single 15-pin D-subminiature joystick port common on later PCs supports two two-axis, two-button joysticks like those supported by the PCjr, and the 15-pin port can be split out to two separate joystick ports with a passive Y-adapter cable.\n\nFurther reinforcing the \"home-friendly\" goal, the PCjr also introduced two [[ROM cartridge]] slots on the front of the unit, meant to load software quickly and easily. The cartridges are plugged in from the front, prompting the computer to automatically reboot and run the software. This is more [[Usability|user-friendly]] than other home computer systems, which must be powered off when a cartridge was removed or inserted and come with warnings about damage to the computer if this requirement is ignored. Loading and saving data from cartridge software is possible via the floppy drive. The cartridge BASIC for the PCjr, in particular, gives programmers the advantage of a real programming language always ready without taking up system memory, as it was firmware, with its own address space. Being stored in ROM the BASIC loads very quickly, not needing access to the floppy disk or other storage.\n\nCartridges can also replace the system BIOS and other firmware.<ref name=\"norton19840320\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1tFFnOMCvv4C&lpg=PA477&pg=PA111#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=Unearthing The PCjr's Secrets | work=PC Magazine | date=March 20, 1984 | access-date=October 24, 2013 | author=Norton, Peter | pages=111}}</ref> A number of patches from various vendors are included on a single \"combo-cartridge\", licensed and sold by PC Enterprises, to support add-on hardware, bypass certain limitations of design, and keep up with changing OS requirements.\n\nExpansions (such as additional parallel ports, serial ports, memory, etc.) to the PCjr are provided via add-on [[daisy chain (electrical engineering)|\"sidecars\" that attach to the side of the PCjr]]. Multiple expansions are stacked together, increasing the width of the machine.\n\nThe floppy controller on the PCjr had its I/O registers mapped into different ports than on the PC, since the PCjr also did not have DMA, the BIOS routines for handling floppy access were different and more complex than those on the PC. Software that tried to perform direct, low-level disk access (mainly utilities, but also the occasional game such as ''Dunzhin: Warrior of Ras'') would not work unless it was rewritten for the PCjr.\n\nThe internal floppy drive on the PCjr was a half-height [[Qume]] 5.25\" unit; IBM also used these drives in the PC Portable, but the PCjr units were specially equipped with a small fan to prevent overheating since the computer did not have a case fan.\n\nThe PCjr's video uses 32&nbsp;kB of RAM as [[shared graphics memory]], which prevents using additional memory with the built-in 128&nbsp;KB under DOS.{{r|norton19840320}}  The specific issue is that while additional external RAM can be added directly above the internal RAM, making a [[flat memory model|flat model]], if the display is used, its buffer must reside somewhere within the first 128&nbsp;KB of RAM (from where it is mirrored at address 0xB8000).  Stock MS-DOS is not prepared to work around the video buffer in low RAM, using RAM both below and above it.  Two obvious solutions exist: Use the additional memory as a [[RAM drive]], or not use the built-in 128&nbsp;KB.<ref name=\"norton19840626\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IGkuDrOYjOcC&lpg=PA407&pg=PA98#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=Adding to Junior's Memory | work=PC Magazine | date=June 26, 1984 | access-date=October 24, 2013 | author=Norton, Peter | pages=98}}</ref>  Another option would be to load a special DOS device driver or TSR, which would claim the RAM selected for use as the video buffer, causing DOS to load other drivers and programs above it.  A fourth option would be not to use MS-DOS, or to use a specially modified version of it.  For programs running from ROM cartridges, not using DOS was a very viable option, even in the mid-1980s when the PCjr was being marketed.\n[[File:IBM PC Jr BASIC Cartridge.jpg|thumb|IBM PC Jr BASIC Cartridge]]\n\n===Differences from other personal computers===\nThe PCjr initially shipped with a wireless [[chiclet keyboard]] called the \"Freeboard\",<ref name=\"halfhill198410\"/> powered by four AA batteries to provide infrared line-of-sight wireless communication.

Estridge said \"It turned out that we had it all wrong\" by expecting that first-time computer users would buy PCjr.{{r|sanger19850707}} Spinnaker's Bowman said \"IBM didn't talk to anybody when they designed this product. They tried to enter a market segment without knowing anything about the customers\".{{r|ap19850321}} Even PCjr's end surprised the company. When it announced the discontinuation IBM promised to continue to support the computer, as it did with mainframes. The press criticized the company, however, for orphaning the product. Executives admitted that the reaction was another example of IBM not understanding the consumer market.{{r|sanger19850707}}\n\n[[Sell-side analyst]] Barbara Isgur correctly predicted in 1984 that the PCjr \"will probably establish the standard operating system for the home market as it has in business.

The machine and its many successors sold well, unlike the PCjr, partly because the Tandy 1000 was sold in ubiquitous [[Radio Shack]] stores and partly because it was less costly, easier to expand, and almost entirely compatible with the IBM PC. The PCjr's enhanced graphics and sound standards became known as \"[[Tandy Graphics Adapter|Tandy-compatible]]\", and many PC games advertised their Tandy support. A company developed a PCjr modification that made it compatible with Tandy software.<ref name=\"loguidice2014\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=wZnpAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA97&pg=PA96#v=onepage&f=false | title=Vintage Game Consoles: An Inside Look at Apple, Atari, Commodore, Nintendo, and the Greatest Gaming Platforms of All Time | publisher=CRC Press |author1=Loguidice, Bill |author2=Barton, Matt | year=2014 | pages=95\u201397 | isbn=978-1135006518}}</ref>\n\n\"[The PCjr] was a nice enough machine, a little underpowered for its price, but not fatally flawed.

Consumers began purchasing DOS computers for the home in large numbers; Radio Shack estimated that half of Tandy 1000 sales went to homes, not offices. The inexpensive clones succeeded with consumers where the PCjr had failed; unlike the IBM product, they were as fast as or faster than the IBM PC and highly compatible.<ref name=\"halfhill198612\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1986-12-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_079_1986_Dec#page/n33/mode/2up | title=The MS-DOS Invasion / IBM Compatibles Are Coming Home | work=Compute! | date=December 1986 | accessdate=November 9, 2013 | author=Halfhill, Tom R. | pages=32}}</ref>\n\nSeveral upgrades for the PCjr were designed by IBM/Teledyne but never reached the store shelves before the IBM PCjr was canceled. These included a wireless joystick and various memory/drive upgrades. PC Enterprises became the last of the major third party vendors to supply full service, parts, and add-ons, extending the functional life of the PCjr to about 10 years, often buying out inventory and rights for PCjr support.\n\nOther manufacturers provided support items for PCjr fans, such as hard drive attachments and specialized sidecars that the user could use to enhance the system. The PCjr was able to run other software designed for the PC, such as word processor, database and spreadsheet programs ran well on the PCjr with 128K of memory. When fully expanded to over 600K memory, the PCjr would run all IBM PC software.<ref>http://oldcomputers.net/ibm-pcjr.html see the comments.</ref>\n\n\nIBM returned to the home market in 1990 with the [[IBM PS/1|PS/1]].

Federal Aviation Administration. effective November 9, 2017</ref> The airport serves [[Downtown Los Angeles]] and the northern [[Greater Los Angeles area]], including [[Glendale, California|Glendale]], [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], and the [[San Fernando Valley]]. It is closer to [[Griffith Park]], [[Hollywood]], and [[Downtown Los Angeles]] than [[Los Angeles International Airport]] (LAX), and is the only airport in the area with a [[Burbank-Bob Hope Airport (Metrolink station)|direct rail connection]] to [[downtown Los Angeles]]. Non-stop flights mostly serve cities in the [[western United States]], while [[JetBlue Airways]] has daily flights to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|New York City]] and [[Logan International Airport|Boston]].\n\nOriginally the entire airport was within the Burbank city limits, but the north end of Runway 15/33 has been extended into the city of Los Angeles. The airport is owned by the '''Burbank\u2013Glendale\u2013Pasadena Airport Authority''' and controlled by the governments of those cities. The Airport Authority contracts with TBI Airport Management, Inc., to operate the airport, which has its own police and fire departments, the [[Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority Police]]. Boarding uses portable boarding steps or ramps rather than [[jet bridge]]s.

One of these airlines was Pacific Air Transport (PAT), which Boeing had acquired because of PAT's west coast mail contract in January 1928.<ref>D. D.

Carpenter, ''A Preliminary Report on the Airports or Landing Fields of Los Angeles County, prepared for the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, October 1, 1926'', typescript in the LAX Archive.

Regional Planning Commission, County of Los Angeles, ''Master Plan'' (Los Angeles, CA: Hall of Records, 1929.) Some authors claim, without documentation, that a federal Department of Commerce survey identified the site. The fact that Dr. Carpenter had been the Los Angeles meteorologist for the U. S.

The airport and its handsome Spanish Revival-style terminal was a showy competitor to nearby [[Grand Central Airport (United States)|Grand Central Airport]] in [[Glendale (California)|Glendale]], which was then Los Angeles' main airline terminal. The new Burbank facility was actually the largest commercial airport in the Los Angeles area until it was eclipsed in 1946 by the [[Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles Airport]] in [[Westchester, California|Westchester]] when that facility (formerly Mines Field, then Los Angeles Municipal Airport) commenced scheduled airline operations.\n\nThe Burbank facility remained United Airport until 1934 when it was renamed ''Union Air Terminal''. The name change came the same year that Federal anti-trust actions caused United Aircraft and Transport to dissolve, which took effect September 26, 1934. The Union Air Terminal moniker stuck until [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] bought the airport in 1940 and renamed it ''Lockheed Air Terminal''.\n\nIn March 1939 sixteen airline departures a day were scheduled out of Burbank: eight on [[United Airlines]], five on [[Western Airlines]] and three on [[TWA]] ([[American Airlines]]' three departures were still at Glendale).<ref>{{Citation |last= |first= |year=1939 |title=Official Aviation Guide |publisher= Official Aviation Guide Company |location=Chicago IL |page= |accessdate= }}</ref> Commercial air traffic continued even while Lockheed's extensive factories supplied the war effort and developed military and civil aircraft into the mid-1960s. The April 1957 OAG lists nine weekday departures on Western, six on United, six on [[Pacific Air Lines]], one on [[TWA]] and one on [[American Airlines]] (a nonstop to Chicago [[Midway Airport]]). [[Pacific Southwest Airlines]] (PSA) had 48 [[Douglas DC-4]] departures a week to SFO and SAN (PSA did not fly out of LAX until 1958).<ref>{{Citation |last= |first= |year=1957 |title=Official Airline Guide |publisher=American Aviation Publications |location=Washington DC |page= |accessdate= }}</ref>  In 1958, Oakland-based [[Transocean Air Lines]] was operating [[Lockheed Constellation]] propliner service three times a week nonstop to Honolulu as well as a Constellation flight operated twice a week on a round trip routing of Oakland - Burbank - Chicago Midway Airport - New York [[Idlewild Airport]] (now [[JFK Airport]]) - Hartford.<ref>http://www.timetableimages.com, Oct. 27, 1958 Transocean Air Lines system timetable</ref>  By the summer of 1962, PSA was operating all of its nonstop flights to San Francisco and San Diego with new [[Lockheed L-188 Electra]] turboprop aircraft with a combined total of 32 departures a week from Burbank.<ref>http://www.timetableimages.com, June 25, 1962 PSA - Pacific Southwest Airlines system timetable</ref>\n\n[[File:Lockheed L-188 Electra, Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA) JP7769673.jpg|thumb|Pacific Southwest Lockheed L-188 Electra, 1962]]\nJet service arrived at Burbank during the late 1960s with [[Pacific Air Lines]] operating [[Boeing 727-100]]s nonstop to Las Vegas and San Francisco as well one-stop direct to Eureka/Arcata. [[Pacific Southwest Airlines]] (PSA) flew from Burbank to the San Francisco Bay Area and San Diego with 727s, and [[Hughes Airwest]] (previously Air West) flew [[Douglas DC-9-10]]s and [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30]]s nonstop to Las Vegas, Phoenix, Salt Lake City and Denver with one-stop DC-9s to [[Houston Hobby Airport]].  Hughes Airwest even operated one-stop DC-9 jet service to [[Grand Canyon National Park Airport]] near the south rim of the Grand Canyon. In 1986 [[United Airlines]] [[Boeing 767-200]]s flew nonstop to [[Chicago O'Hare Airport]]; the wide body 767 was the largest passenger airliner ever to serve Burbank. [[AirCal]] [[McDonnell Douglas MD-80]]s flew nonstop to the Bay Area and direct to Lake Tahoe.\n\nIn 1967 Lockheed renamed the facility ''Hollywood-Burbank Airport''. In 1970 [[Continental Airlines]] began [[Boeing 727-200]] flights to Portland and Seattle via San Jose and also flew the short hop to Ontario. Continental later offered flights to Chicago via Ontario. Continental went on to serve Denver with nonstop Boeing 727-200s from BUR. [[Alaska Airlines]] began serving Burbank in 1981 with Boeing 727-100s and 727-200s flying nonstop and direct to Seattle and Portland, which was Alaska Air's first service to southern California.<ref>http://www.departedflights.com, 1981 Alaska Airlines annual report</ref> [[Aloha Airlines]] pioneered nonstop jet service from BUR to Hawaii, flying [[Boeing 737-700]]s to Honolulu before ceasing all passenger operations.\n\nA 1973 decision by the [[United States Supreme Court]] in ''City of Burbank v. Lockheed Air Terminal, Inc.'' overturned an airport curfew imposed by the city of [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] on flights between 11:00 PM and 7:00 AM under the U.S. Constitution's [[Supremacy Clause]] on the grounds that airports were subject to federal oversight by the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] and under the terms of the [[Noise Control Act]] of 1972.<ref>[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/411/624/case.html ''City of Burbank v.

Airport funding sources include FAA grants, parking fees, landing fees charged to airlines, as well as rents from restaurants and other concession businesses operating at the airport. There are also fees charged on airline tickets sold, including passenger facility charges and federal taxes. Once the funding is nailed down, the Airport Authority will bid for the project. The replacement terminal is expected to encompass 355,000 square feet and the same number of gates (14).

Westover's intended landing field was not Bob Hope Airport (then Union Air Terminal), but a nearby landing field, Lockheed Aircraft Company Plant B-1 Airfield (34.189\u00b0N, 118.331\u00b0W), 1 mile southeast of Bob Hope Airport, which existed from ca. 1928 until World War II.  The site is now the Empire Center Shopping Center, with a Staples, Lowe's, and Target where the runway had been.\n* On August 6, 1945, leading U.S. fighter ace [[Richard Bong]] was killed when his plane's primary fuel pump malfunctioned during takeoff on the acceptance flight of P-80A 44-85048. Bong either forgot to switch to the auxiliary fuel pump, or for some reason was unable to do so. Bong bailed out of the aircraft but was too low for his parachute to deploy. The plane crashed into a narrow field at Oxnard St & Satsuma Ave, North Hollywood.\n* On October 31, 1951, a Pacific Southwest DC-3 crashed shortly after take-off into [[Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery]], immediately south of the airport. Though damaged, the fuselage remained intact and there were only very minor injuries.\n* On September 8, 1955, Currey Air Transport Flight 24, a [[Douglas DC-3]] bound for [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], crashed on the airport property while returning to the airfield after experiencing an engine failure shortly after takeoff.  The plane, N74663, struck a power line on the southern boundary of the airport, causing it to crash into two parked Air Force C-54 aircraft and a [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed Aircraft]] service hangar. The pilot, co-pilot and an airport employee on the ground were killed; the plane's stewardess and one passenger were seriously injured.  The remaining 29 passengers on board received minor injuries.\n* On December 14, 1962, a [[Flying Tiger Line]] Lockheed L-1049H Super Constellation freighter (N6913C) crashed in dense fog 1-1/2 miles west of the airport during an instrument landing system (ILS) approach to Runway 07.  The Constellation clipped a telephone pole and billboard and crashed in an industrial and residential neighborhood near the intersection of Lankershim Boulevard and Vose Street in [[North Hollywood, California|North Hollywood]] after the aircraft's 38-year-old pilot suffered a heart attack at a critical point in the landing approach.  All five occupants of the Constellation\u2014the pilot, co-pilot, flight engineer and two non-revenue passengers\u2014died in the crash.  Also killed were two persons in a commercial building and a teen-age girl in a house that were among the structures struck by the plane.\n* On December 5, 1982, [[Douglas C-53]] N163E operated by P Crossman was damaged beyond repair in a taxiing accident.<ref name=ASN051282>{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19821205-0 |title=N163E Accident report |publisher=Aviation Safety Network |accessdate=July 13, 2010}}</ref>\n* On March 5, 2000, [[Southwest Airlines Flight 1455]], upon landing on Runway 8 at Burbank following a flight from [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], overran the runway, injuring 44.  The [[Boeing 737]] crashed through a metal blast barrier at the end of the runway, then an airport [[perimeter fence]], and came to rest in the traffic lanes of Hollywood Way, a main north\u2013south thoroughfare.  The plane stopped close to a [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] gasoline station located across the street from the runway.  The incident resulted in the dismissal of the pilots.  The Chevron gasoline station was subsequently closed and removed due to safety concerns.\n*On September 21, 2005, [[JetBlue Flight 292]] took off from Burbank, and the nose gear failed to retract and instead jammed sideways. The aircraft spent several hours in the air before safely making an emergency landing at [[Los Angeles International Airport|LAX]], with 140 passengers and 6 crew members aboard. The [[Airbus A320]] was originally bound for [[JFK International Airport]], in [[New York City, New York|New York City]]. After the aircraft took off, the incident was quickly captured by news helicopters which ran feed that was shown live nationally on cable news. Notably, many passengers on the flight said they watched images of their own aircraft's flight on JetBlue's LiveTV system.\n* On October 13, 2006, a [[Gulfstream Aerospace]] jet overran the runway upon landing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/aviationquery/brief2.aspx?ev_id=20061101X01596&ntsbno=LAX07IA008 |title=N113AR Accident report |publisher=[[National Transportation Safety Board]] |accessdate=November 16, 2014}}</ref> There were no reported injuries amongst the five passengers and two crew members.

The airport and its handsome Spanish Revival-style terminal was a showy competitor to nearby [[Grand Central Airport (United States)|Grand Central Airport]] in [[Glendale (California)|Glendale]], which was then Los Angeles' main airline terminal. The new Burbank facility was actually the largest commercial airport in the Los Angeles area until it was eclipsed in 1946 by the [[Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles Airport]] in [[Westchester, California|Westchester]] when that facility (formerly Mines Field, then Los Angeles Municipal Airport) commenced scheduled airline operations.\n\nThe Burbank facility remained United Airport until 1934 when it was renamed ''Union Air Terminal''. The name change came the same year that Federal anti-trust actions caused United Aircraft and Transport to dissolve, which took effect September 26, 1934. The Union Air Terminal moniker stuck until [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] bought the airport in 1940 and renamed it ''Lockheed Air Terminal''.\n\nIn March 1939 sixteen airline departures a day were scheduled out of Burbank: eight on [[United Airlines]], five on [[Western Airlines]] and three on [[TWA]] ([[American Airlines]]' three departures were still at Glendale).<ref>{{Citation |last= |first= |year=1939 |title=Official Aviation Guide |publisher= Official Aviation Guide Company |location=Chicago IL |page= |accessdate= }}</ref> Commercial air traffic continued even while Lockheed's extensive factories supplied the war effort and developed military and civil aircraft into the mid-1960s. The April 1957 OAG lists nine weekday departures on Western, six on United, six on [[Pacific Air Lines]], one on [[TWA]] and one on [[American Airlines]] (a nonstop to Chicago [[Midway Airport]]). [[Pacific Southwest Airlines]] (PSA) had 48 [[Douglas DC-4]] departures a week to SFO and SAN (PSA did not fly out of LAX until 1958).<ref>{{Citation |last= |first= |year=1957 |title=Official Airline Guide |publisher=American Aviation Publications |location=Washington DC |page= |accessdate= }}</ref>  In 1958, Oakland-based [[Transocean Air Lines]] was operating [[Lockheed Constellation]] propliner service three times a week nonstop to Honolulu as well as a Constellation flight operated twice a week on a round trip routing of Oakland - Burbank - Chicago Midway Airport - New York [[Idlewild Airport]] (now [[JFK Airport]]) - Hartford.<ref>http://www.timetableimages.com, Oct. 27, 1958 Transocean Air Lines system timetable</ref>  By the summer of 1962, PSA was operating all of its nonstop flights to San Francisco and San Diego with new [[Lockheed L-188 Electra]] turboprop aircraft with a combined total of 32 departures a week from Burbank.<ref>http://www.timetableimages.com, June 25, 1962 PSA - Pacific Southwest Airlines system timetable</ref>\n\n[[File:Lockheed L-188 Electra, Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA) JP7769673.jpg|thumb|Pacific Southwest Lockheed L-188 Electra, 1962]]\nJet service arrived at Burbank during the late 1960s with [[Pacific Air Lines]] operating [[Boeing 727-100]]s nonstop to Las Vegas and San Francisco as well one-stop direct to Eureka/Arcata.

Hughes Airwest even operated one-stop DC-9 jet service to [[Grand Canyon National Park Airport]] near the south rim of the Grand Canyon. In 1986 [[United Airlines]] [[Boeing 767-200]]s flew nonstop to [[Chicago O'Hare Airport]]; the wide body 767 was the largest passenger airliner ever to serve Burbank. [[AirCal]] [[McDonnell Douglas MD-80]]s flew nonstop to the Bay Area and direct to Lake Tahoe.\n\nIn 1967 Lockheed renamed the facility ''Hollywood-Burbank Airport''. In 1970 [[Continental Airlines]] began [[Boeing 727-200]] flights to Portland and Seattle via San Jose and also flew the short hop to Ontario. Continental later offered flights to Chicago via Ontario. Continental went on to serve Denver with nonstop Boeing 727-200s from BUR. [[Alaska Airlines]] began serving Burbank in 1981 with Boeing 727-100s and 727-200s flying nonstop and direct to Seattle and Portland, which was Alaska Air's first service to southern California.<ref>http://www.departedflights.com, 1981 Alaska Airlines annual report</ref> [[Aloha Airlines]] pioneered nonstop jet service from BUR to Hawaii, flying [[Boeing 737-700]]s to Honolulu before ceasing all passenger operations.\n\nA 1973 decision by the [[United States Supreme Court]] in ''City of Burbank v.

Airport funding sources include FAA grants, parking fees, landing fees charged to airlines, as well as rents from restaurants and other concession businesses operating at the airport. There are also fees charged on airline tickets sold, including passenger facility charges and federal taxes. Once the funding is nailed down, the Airport Authority will bid for the project. The replacement terminal is expected to encompass 355,000 square feet and the same number of gates (14).

The result is a challenging landing for even the most experienced pilots.\n\n* On September 21, 1938, [[USAAC]] Chief Maj. Gen. [[Oscar Westover]] was killed in the crash of [[Northrop A-17]]AS, ''36-349'', c/n 289, '1', out of [[Bolling Field]], [[Washington, D.C.]], in a crosswind short of the runway. The single-engined attack design, used as a high-speed staff transport, crashed into a house at 1007 Scott Road in Burbank. Also killed was Westover's mechanic, S/Sgt Samuel Hymes.<ref name=\"Bowers, Peter M. 1972, p. 33\">Bowers, Peter M., \"''Captain of the Clouds''\", Airpower, Granada Hills, California, July 1972, Volume 2, Number 4, p. 33.</ref> (Another source identifies him as Sgt.

Westover's intended landing field was not Bob Hope Airport (then Union Air Terminal), but a nearby landing field, Lockheed Aircraft Company Plant B-1 Airfield (34.189\u00b0N, 118.331\u00b0W), 1 mile southeast of Bob Hope Airport, which existed from ca. 1928 until World War II.  The site is now the Empire Center Shopping Center, with a Staples, Lowe's, and Target where the runway had been.\n* On August 6, 1945, leading U.S. fighter ace [[Richard Bong]] was killed when his plane's primary fuel pump malfunctioned during takeoff on the acceptance flight of P-80A 44-85048. Bong either forgot to switch to the auxiliary fuel pump, or for some reason was unable to do so. Bong bailed out of the aircraft but was too low for his parachute to deploy. The plane crashed into a narrow field at Oxnard St & Satsuma Ave, North Hollywood.\n* On October 31, 1951, a Pacific Southwest DC-3 crashed shortly after take-off into [[Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery]], immediately south of the airport. Though damaged, the fuselage remained intact and there were only very minor injuries.\n* On September 8, 1955, Currey Air Transport Flight 24, a [[Douglas DC-3]] bound for [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], crashed on the airport property while returning to the airfield after experiencing an engine failure shortly after takeoff.  The plane, N74663, struck a power line on the southern boundary of the airport, causing it to crash into two parked Air Force C-54 aircraft and a [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed Aircraft]] service hangar. The pilot, co-pilot and an airport employee on the ground were killed; the plane's stewardess and one passenger were seriously injured.  The remaining 29 passengers on board received minor injuries.\n* On December 14, 1962, a [[Flying Tiger Line]] Lockheed L-1049H Super Constellation freighter (N6913C) crashed in dense fog 1-1/2 miles west of the airport during an instrument landing system (ILS) approach to Runway 07.  The Constellation clipped a telephone pole and billboard and crashed in an industrial and residential neighborhood near the intersection of Lankershim Boulevard and Vose Street in [[North Hollywood, California|North Hollywood]] after the aircraft's 38-year-old pilot suffered a heart attack at a critical point in the landing approach.  All five occupants of the Constellation\u2014the pilot, co-pilot, flight engineer and two non-revenue passengers\u2014died in the crash.  Also killed were two persons in a commercial building and a teen-age girl in a house that were among the structures struck by the plane.\n* On December 5, 1982, [[Douglas C-53]] N163E operated by P Crossman was damaged beyond repair in a taxiing accident.<ref name=ASN051282>{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19821205-0 |title=N163E Accident report |publisher=Aviation Safety Network |accessdate=July 13, 2010}}</ref>\n* On March 5, 2000, [[Southwest Airlines Flight 1455]], upon landing on Runway 8 at Burbank following a flight from [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], overran the runway, injuring 44.  The [[Boeing 737]] crashed through a metal blast barrier at the end of the runway, then an airport [[perimeter fence]], and came to rest in the traffic lanes of Hollywood Way, a main north\u2013south thoroughfare.  The plane stopped close to a [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] gasoline station located across the street from the runway.  The incident resulted in the dismissal of the pilots.  The Chevron gasoline station was subsequently closed and removed due to safety concerns.\n*On September 21, 2005, [[JetBlue Flight 292]] took off from Burbank, and the nose gear failed to retract and instead jammed sideways. The aircraft spent several hours in the air before safely making an emergency landing at [[Los Angeles International Airport|LAX]], with 140 passengers and 6 crew members aboard. The [[Airbus A320]] was originally bound for [[JFK International Airport]], in [[New York City, New York|New York City]]. After the aircraft took off, the incident was quickly captured by news helicopters which ran feed that was shown live nationally on cable news. Notably, many passengers on the flight said they watched images of their own aircraft's flight on JetBlue's LiveTV system.\n* On October 13, 2006, a [[Gulfstream Aerospace]] jet overran the runway upon landing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/aviationquery/brief2.aspx?ev_id=20061101X01596&ntsbno=LAX07IA008 |title=N113AR Accident report |publisher=[[National Transportation Safety Board]] |accessdate=November 16, 2014}}</ref> There were no reported injuries amongst the five passengers and two crew members. [[New York Yankees]] third baseman [[Alex Rodriguez]] was on board, on his way to attend the funeral of teammate [[Cory Lidle]]. Rodriguez was uninjured, but the accident happened two days after [[2006 New York City plane crash|the fatal plane crash of his teammate]].\n* On December 6, 2018, [[Southwest Airlines]] Flight 278 from Oakland overran the runway in heavy rain. The flight was stopped by the [[Engineered materials arrestor system|EMAS]] installed following the [[Southwest Airlines Flight 1455]] incident in 2000.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/flights/2018/12/06/southwest-airlines-plane-skids-off-runway-burbank-airport-california/2226932002/|title=Southwest plane skids off the runway in rainy weather in California|website=USA TODAY|first=Dawn |last=Gilbertson|date=December 6, 2018|access-date= 6 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[California World War II Army Airfields]]\n* [[List of airports in California]]\n* {{Air Force Historical Research Agency}}\n{{Portal bar|World War II|Los Angeles|Aviation}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Hollywood Burbank Airport}}\n* [http://hollywoodburbankairport.com/ Hollywood Burbank Airport], official site\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090107083529/http://www.burbank.com/burbank-airport.php Burbank Airport] at Burbank.com\n* [http://msrmaps.com/map.aspx?t=4&s=12&lat=34.2037&lon=-118.3592&w=600&h=700&lp=---+None+--- Aerial image as of March 2004] from [[USGS]] ''[[The National Map]]''\n* {{FAA-diagram|00067}}\n* {{FAA-procedures|BUR}}\n{{US-airport|BUR}}\n* [https://acukwik.com/Airport-Info/KBUR AC-U-KWIK information for KBUR]\n\n<!--Navigation boxes--><br />\n{{Geographic location\n|Center    = Bob Hope Airport\n|North     = [[Sun Valley, Los Angeles|Sun Valley]] and ''[[Verdugo Mountains]]'' \n|Northeast = ''[[Verdugo Mountains]]'' and [[Sunland-Tujunga, Los Angeles]]\n|East      = [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] and ''[[Interstate 5#California|I-5]]''\n|Southeast = [[Burbank, California|Burbank]]\n|South     = [[Toluca Lake, Los Angeles]]\n|Southwest = [[North Hollywood, Los Angeles|North Hollywood]]\n|West      = [[North Hollywood, Los Angeles|North Hollywood]] and ''[[Interstate 170|I-170]]'' \n|Northwest = [[Sun Valley, Los Angeles|Sun Valley]]\n}}\n\n{{Burbank, California}}\n{{Public Transportation in Greater Los Angeles|state=collapsed}}\n{{Greater Los Angeles Airports}}\n{{Bob Hope}}\n\n[[Category:Airports in Los Angeles County, California]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Burbank, California]]\n[[Category:Public transportation in Los Angeles County, California]]\n[[Category:Public transportation in the San Fernando Valley]]\n[[Category:Transportation in the San Fernando Valley]]\n[[Category:Airports established in 1930]]\n[[Category:1930 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:Airfields of the United States Army Air Forces Technical Service Command]]\n[[Category:Airfields of the United States Army Air Forces in California]]\n", "name_user": "Cnwilliams", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguated:Metrolink\u2192Metrolink (California)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Burbank_Airport"}
