British forces besieged and captured the city of [[Havana]], which at the time was an important [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] naval base in the [[Caribbean]], and dealt a serious blow to the [[Spanish Navy]]. Havana was subsequently returned to Spain under the 1763 [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] that formally ended the war.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Anglo-Spanish War (1762\u20131763)}}\nHavana in the late 18th century was a major port and naval base, and also the strongest fortress in Spanish America. Its royal shipyard with access to abundant supplies of resistant hardwoods was capable of building [[first-rate]] warships and had been developed by the Bourbon monarchy as the most important of its three naval shipyards.<ref name=\"Roger50\">Roger p. 50</ref><ref name=\"Schneider72-73\">Schneider pp. 72-73</ref> There had been several previous plans to attack Havana, including one proposed to [[Edward Vernon|Vernon]] in 1739, which he rejected in favour of an attack on  [[Battle of Porto Bello|Portobello]],<ref name=\"Bradley201\">Bradley p. 201</ref> but no successful attack since it was comprehensively fortified,<ref name=\"Schneider21\">Schneider p. 21</ref> and the strength of its fortifications and difficulty that large sailing warships would have in making an undetected approach from the north convinced the Spanish commanders it would be virtually impossible to capture, if its fortifications were in good order and it was properly garrisoned. Its wealth and ability to feed its population also suggested that it could resist being starved into surrender.<ref name=\"Roger50-51\">Roger pp. 50-51</ref><ref name=\"Schneider61,106\">Schneider pp. 61,106</ref>\n\nBritain had been formally at war with France since May 1756, but Spain under [[Ferdinand VI of Spain| Ferdinand VI]] remained neutral. After Ferdinand's death on 1759, his half-brother [[Charles III of Spain| Charles III]] reversed Ferdinand's policy and, by the [[Treaty of Paris (1761)]], re-established the so-called [[Pacte de Famille| Family Compact]] between France and Spain. This treaty involved an offensive alliance directed against Britain, and in December 1761, Spain placed an [[Economic sanctions| embargo]] on British trade, seized British goods and expelled British merchants. In response to this, Britain declared war on Spain in January 1762.<ref>Danley and Speelman pp. 431-432</ref> \n\n===Spanish preparations===\nBefore involving his country in the conflict raging in Europe and across the world, Charles III made provisions to defend the [[Spanish colonies]] against the [[British Royal Navy]]. For the defence of Cuba, he appointed [[Juan de Prado Mayera Portocarrero y Luna|Juan de Prado]] as commander-in-chief.  De Prado arrived at [[Havana]] in February 1761 and began work to improve the fortifications of the city.<ref name=\"Schneider82\">Schneider p. 82</ref>\n\nIn June 1761, a flotilla of seven [[ships of the line]] under the command of Admiral [[Gutierre de Hevia]] arrived at Havana, transporting two regular infantry regiments (Espa\u00f1a and Arag\u00f3n) totalling 996 men, bringing the Havana garrison to 2,400 regular infantry. There were also 6,300 sailors and marines aboard the ships.<ref>Greentree p. 15</ref> However, [[yellow fever]] had reduced the defending forces of the city by the time the siege began to 1,900 regular infantry, 750 marines, around 5,000 sailors and 2,000 to 3,000 armed militia, besides several thousand more without firearms or training.<ref>Greentree p. 20</ref> The main garrison consisted of:\n[[File:A plan of the Havana and its environs, with the several posts and attacks by Thomas Kitchin.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A plan of Havana and its environs in 1762, by [[Thomas Kitchen]]]]\n* Espa\u00f1a Infantry Regiment (481)\n* Arag\u00f3n Infantry Regiment (265)\n* Havana Infantry Regiment (856)\n* Edinburgh's Dragoons (150)\n* Army's gunners (104)\n* Navy's gunners and marines (750)\n\nHavana had one of the finest natural harbours in the [[West Indies]] with a 180&nbsp;m wide and 800&nbsp;m long entrance channel giving access to the harbour. Two strong [[fortress]]es defended the entrance channel; on the north side of the channel stood the very strong ''Castillo de los Tres Reyes del Morro'' (known in English as [[Morro Castle (Havana)|Morro Castle]]) on the rocky Cavannos Ridge. It had 64 heavy guns and was garrisoned by 700 men. However, it had been noted that most of its guns faced Havana's port and bay, and that it was overlooked by the unfortified hill of La Cabana. Although it had been proposed to fortify La Cabana, the project had been delayed and no guns had been installed there.<ref>Greentree p. 30</ref>The south side was defended by the older ''[[San Salvador de la Punta Fortress|Castillo de San Salvador de la Punta]]''.<ref name=\"Schneider68\">Schneider p. 68</ref> The channel could also be blocked by a [[boom (navigational barrier)|boom chain]] extending from El Morro to La Punta. Havana itself lay on the south side along the channel and was surrounded by a wall {{convert|5|km|mi}} long.<ref name=\"Schneider54\">Schneider p. 54</ref>\n\n===British preparations===\nTwo days after the declaration of war with Spain, on the advice of [[George Anson, 1st Baron Anson| Lord Anson]], the British cabinet chose Havana as a major objective in its attack on Spain because of its strategic importance, believing that its permanent loss would weaken Spanish influence in the Caribbean. Detailed plans were made for a combined naval and military attack on Havana, relying on the Royal Navy's superiority in numbers and effectiveness over the Spanish fleet. Vice-Admiral Sir [[George Pocock]], with seven ships-of-the-line and a frigate, was to transport a military force under the command of [[George Keppel, 3rd Earl of Albemarle]] to the [[West Indies]], to join the West Indies naval squadron, then under the command of [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney| Rear-Admiral Rodney, who was commanding operations against [[Martinique]], taking on additional troops and proceeding to the northwest of [[Haiti]] to embark 4,000 men from the British colonies in North America, commanded by [[Jeffrey Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffrey Amherst]]. It was to keep its final destination in doubt until it launched its amphibious attack on Havana.<ref name=\"Bradley223-224\">Bradley pp. 223-224</ref> These plans were modified to meet circumstances, as Rodney and [[Robert Monckton| General ]Monckton] commanding the troops had captured Martinique before Pocock sailed, 3,000 British and American troops from New York did not arrive at Havana until late July, and the plan to take up to 2,000 slaves from [[Jamaica]] to act as [[Pioneer (military)| pioneers]] only produced 600 slaves, as many owners were reluctant to part with them.<ref name=\"Bradley224-225\">Bradley pp. 224-225</ref> A plan by Amherst to assemble a force of 8,000 men for an attack on [[French Louisiana|Louisiana]] was dismissed by Albemarle as impractical.<ref>Danley and Speelman p.320</ref>\n\nDuring the month of February, British troops embarked; they consisted of:\n* [[Cheshire regiment|22nd Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[34th Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[56th Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[72nd Richmond's Regiment of Foot]]\n\nOn 5 March the British expedition sailed from [[Spithead]], England, with 7 ships of the line and 4,365 men aboard 64 transports, and arrived in [[Barbados]] on 20 April.  Five days later the expedition reached [[Fort-de-France|Fort Royal]] on the recently conquered island of [[Martinique]] where it picked up the remainder of Major-General [[Robert Monckton]]'s expedition, still numbering 8,461 men. Rear Admiral [[George Rodney]]'s squadron, amounting to 8 ships of the line also joined the expedition bringing the total number of ships of the line to 15.\n\nOn 23 May the expedition, now off the northwest corner of Saint-Domingue (present-day [[Haiti]]), was further reinforced by [[Sir James Douglas, 1st Baronet|Sir James Douglas]]' squadron from [[Port Royal, Jamaica]]. The force under Albemarle now amounted to 21 ships of the line, 24 lesser warships, and 168 other vessels, carrying some 14,000 seamen and marines plus another 3,000 hired sailors and 12,826 regulars.\n{{wide image|L'escadre anglaise pour attaquer La Havane en 1762.jpg|800px|align-cap=center|General view of the English squadron}}\n\n==Siege==\nThe  normal approach to Havana, on the north coast of Cuba, was to sail west parallel to the south coast of the island on the prevailing south-easterly wind, then to round its western tip and sail east towards Havana, against the wind. This last section, more than 200 [[mile]]s ling, would take a large squadron at least one week, and probably several, giving ample warning for Havana to prepare. To the north of Havana, as far as [[the Bahamas]] is a wide expanse of shallow water, [[reef]]s and small islands or [[cay]]s], accessible only to small boats except for one deep water channel, the [[Old Bahama Channel]] which is only some 10 miles wide at its narrowest. Although the Spanish navigators that charted it thought too dangerous for large warships, it was surveyed by a British frigate, whose captain left parties of his men in the cays to mark the extremities of the channel, allowing the whole fleet to pass through it, safely and undetected.<ref name=\"Bradley225\">Bradley p. 225</ref><ref name=\"Roger50-52\">Roger pp. 50-52</ref>    \n\nOn 6 June the British force came into sight of Havana. Immediately, 12 British ships of the line were sent to the mouth of the entrance channel to block in the Spanish fleet. The British planned to begin the operations by the reduction of the Morro fortress, on the north side of the channel, through a formal [[Vauban]]-style siege. The commanding position of this fort over the city would then force the Spanish commander to surrender. However, this plan did not take into account the fact that the fortress was located on a rocky promontory where it was impossible to dig approach trenches and that a large ditch cut into the rock protected the fort on the land side.\n[[File:Standard guide to Cuba - a new and complete guide to the island of Cuba, with maps, illustrations, routes of travel, history, and an English-Spanish phrase book (1909) (14801359763).jpg|thumb|Map of the Siege]]\n\nThe Spanish force under Prado and Admiral Hevia, surprised by the size of the attacking force, adopted a delaying defensive strategy. It had several advantages besides the hope of a relief force. Firstly, the [[hurricane]] season would begin in late August, putting the British fleet in danger: the wet weather starting earlier in that month would probably also initiate an outbreak of [[yellow fever]] among the besiegers.<ref name=\"Schneider126-127\">Schneider pp. 126-127</ref> Secondly, despite some losses from tropical diseases Prado had 1,500 Spanish regular soldiers and some 2,300 colonial [[militiamen]], as well as sailors from the fleet. The ships of the Spanish fleet was kept in the harbour while its sailors, gunners and marines were sent to garrison the fortresses of Morro and Punta which were placed under the command of naval officers.<ref name=\"Schneider121\">Schneider p. 121</ref> Most of the shot and powder of the fleet as well as its best guns were also transferred to these two fortresses. Meanwhile, regular troops were assigned to the defence of the city. Prado also ordered all women, children and the old and infirm to leave the city, leaving only men able to bear arms.<ref name=\"Schneider135\">Schneider p. 135</ref>\n\nThe channel entrance was immediately closed with the [[boom (navigational barrier)|boom chain]]. Furthermore, 3 ships of the line (''Asia'' (64), ''Europa'' (64) and ''Neptuno'' (74)) were selected among the fleet for their poor condition and sunk behind the boom chain. Realising the importance of the Morro, the Spanish commanders gave it top priority.<ref name=\"Schneider122\">Schneider p. 122</ref>\n\nThe following day British troops were landed northeast of Havana, and began advancing west the next day.<ref>Guiteras pp. 79-80</ref> They met a militia party that was easily pushed back. By the end of the day, British infantry had reached the vicinity of Havana.<ref>Pockock p. 221</ref>  The defence of the Morro was assigned to [[Luis Vicente de Velasco e Isla]], a naval officer, who immediately took measures to prepare and provision the fortress for a siege.<ref name=\"Schneider121\">Schneider p. 121</ref>\n\n===Siege of El Morro===\n[[File:LindsayCambridge.jpg|thumb|left|Bombardment of the Morro Castle, Havana, 1 July 1762 by [[Richard Paton]]]]\nOn 11 June a British party stormed a detached redoubt on the Cavannos heights.<ref>Guiteras p. 84</ref> Only then did the British command realise how strong the Morro was, surrounded by brushwood and protected by a large ditch.<ref>Pockock p. 226</ref>  With the arrival of their siege train the next day, the British began erecting batteries among the trees on La Cabana hill overlooking the Morro (some {{convert|7|m|ft}} higher) as well as the city and the bay. Surprisingly, this hill had been left undefended by the Spanish army despite its well-known strategic importance.<ref>Pockock p. 227</ref>  The king of Spain had even instructed Prado to fortify this hill, a task that he considered the most urgent among those confided to his commander.<ref name=\"Bradley226-227\">Bradley pp. 226-227</ref>\n\nTwo days later a British detachment landed at [[Torre\u00f3n de la Chorrera]], on the west side of the harbour. Meanwhile, Colonel [[Patrick Mackellar]], an engineer, was overseeing the construction of the siege works against the Morro.<ref>Pockock pp. 223-224</ref> Since digging trenches was impossible, he resolved to erect breastworks instead.<ref name=\"Bradley227-228\">Bradley pp. 227-228</ref> He planned to mine towards a bastion of the Morro once his siege works would have reached the ditch and to create a runway across this ditch with the rubble produced by his mining activities.\n\nBy 22 June, four British batteries totalling twelve heavy guns and 38 mortars opened fire on the Morro from La Cabana. Mackellar gradually advanced his breastworks towards the ditch under cover of these batteries so by the end of the month the British had increased their daily direct hits on the Morro to 500.<ref>Pockock p. 229</ref>  Velasco was losing as many as 30 men each day, and the workload of repairing the fortress every night was so exhausting that men had to be rotated into the fort from the city every three days. Velasco finally managed to convince Prado that a raid was necessary against the British batteries. At dawn on 29 June 988 men (a mixed company of grenadiers, marines, engineers, and slaves) attacked the siege works. They reached the British batteries from the rear and started to spike guns, but British reaction was swift, and the attackers were repulsed before they caused any serious damage.<ref>Pockock pp. 230-231</ref>\n[[File:Dominic Serres the Elder - The Capture of Havana, 1762, the English Battery before Morro Castle.jpg|thumb|300px|right|British siege guns before Morro Castle, by Dominic Serres]]\n\nOn 1 July, the British launched a combined land and naval attack on the Morro. The fleet detached four ships of the line for this purpose: [[HMS Stirling Castle (1742)|HMS ''Stirling Castle'']], [[HMS Dragon (1760)|HMS ''Dragon'']], [[HMS St Michael (1669)|HMS ''Marlborough'']] and [[HMS Cambridge (1755)|HMS ''Cambridge'']].<ref>Guiteras pp. 95-96</ref> The naval and land artillery simultaneously opened fire on the Morro. However, naval guns were ineffective, the fort being located too high.<ref>Pockock pp. 231-232</ref>  Counter-fire from thirty guns of the Morro inflicted 192 casualties and seriously damaged the ships, one of which was later scuttled, forcing them to withdraw. Meanwhile, the bombardment by the land artillery was far more effective. By the end of the day, only three Spanish guns were still effective on the side of the Morro facing the British batteries. The next day however British breastworks around the Morro caught fire and the batteries were burned down, destroying the product of much of the work undertaken since mid June.<ref>Pockock p. 237</ref> Velasco immediately capitalised on this event, remounting many guns and repairing breaches in the fortifications of the Morro.<ref>Guiteras p. 97</ref>\n\nSince its arrival at Havana, the British army had heavily suffered from [[yellow fever]] and was now at half strength. Since the [[Atlantic hurricane season|hurricane season]] was approaching, Albemarle was now engaged in a race against time. He ordered the batteries to be rebuilt with the help of men of the fleet. Many [[32-pounder gun]]s were taken from the lower deck of several ships to equip these new batteries.\n\nBy 17 July the new British batteries had progressively silenced most of Velasco's guns, leaving only two of them operational. With the absence of artillery cover, it now became impossible for the Spanish troops to repair the damage being inflicted on the Morro.<ref>Guiteras p. 104</ref> Mackellar was also able to resume construction of siege works to approach the fortress. With the army in such a bad condition, work progressed rather slowly. All hope of the British army now resided in the expected arrival of reinforcements from North America.\n\nThe progress of siege works over the next few days allowed the British to begin the mining towards the right bastion of the Morro.<ref>Guiteras pp. 104-105</ref> Meanwhile, the now unopposed British artillery was daily hitting the Morro up to 600 times, causing some sixty casualties. Velasco had now no hope but to destroy British siege works and so on 22 July 1,300 regulars, seamen and militia sallied from Havana in three columns and attacked the siege works surrounding the Morro. The British repelled the Spanish sortie who thus withdrew to their lines and the siege works were left relatively intact.<ref>Guiteras pp. 107-108</ref>\n[[File:Joshua reynolds, ritratto del general maggiore william keppel, 1762-65 ca.jpg|thumb|left|General [[William Keppel (British Army officer, born 1727)|William Keppel]], ''Storming the Morro Castle'', by [[Joshua Reynolds]]]]\n\nOn 24 July Albemarle offered Velasco the opportunity to surrender, allowing him to write his own terms of capitulation. Velasco answered that the issue would rather be settled by force of arms. Three days later the reinforcements from North America led by Colonel Burton finally arrived.<ref>Guiteras pp. 116-117</ref> During their journey, they had been attacked by the French, who captured some 500 men. These reinforcements consisted of:\n* [[46th (South Devonshire) Regiment of Foot|46th Thomas Murray's Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[58th (Rutlandshire) Regiment of Foot|58th Anstruther's Regiment of Foot]]\n* American provincials (3,000 men)\n* [[Gorham's Rangers|Gorham's]] and [[Danks' Rangers]] - which were combined into a 253-man ranger corps.\n\nOn 29 July the mine near the right bastion of the Morro fort was completed and ready to explode.<ref name=\"Schneider151\">Schneider p. 151</ref> Albemarle vainly feigned an assault, hoping that Velasco would finally decide to surrender. On the contrary, Velasco decided to launched a desperate attack from the sea upon the British miners in the ditch.<ref>Pockock p. 239</ref> At 2:00 am the next day two Spanish schooners attacked the miners from the sea. Their attack was unsuccessful and they had to withdraw. At 1:00 pm the British finally detonated the mine. The debris of the explosion partly filled the ditch but Albemarle judged it passable,<ref name=\"Schneider155\">Schneider p. 155</ref> and launched an assault, sending 699 picked men against the right bastion. Before the Spanish could react, sixteen men gained a foothold on the bastion.<ref>Pockock p. 241</ref> Velasco rushed to the breach with his troops, and was mortally wounded during the ensuing hand-to-hand fighting. The Spanish troops fell back, leaving the British in control of the Morro fort.<ref>Guiteras pp. 124-125</ref> Velasco was transported back to Havana, but by 31 July had died of his wounds.<ref name=\"Schneider151,225\">Schneider pp. 151, 225</ref>\n\nThe British then occupied a position commanding the city of Havana as well as the bay.<ref>Pockock p. 244</ref> Artillery batteries were brought up along the north side of the entrance channel from the Morro fort to La Cabana hill, where they could be trained directly on the town.<ref>Guiteras p. 142</ref>\n[[File:Spanish flag RMG RP-76-19.jpg|thumb|300px|Parts of a patched Spanish flag captured during the assault on Moro Castle, showing arms of [[Castille and Leon]] with [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon arms]] in centre surrounded by [[Order of the Golden Fleece]] (from [[Royal Museums Greenwich]])]]\n\n===Surrender===\nOn 11 August, after Prado had rejected the demand for surrender sent to him by Albemarle, the British batteries opened fire on Havana.<ref>Guiteras p. 144</ref> A total of 47 guns (15 \u00d7 32-pdrs, 32 \u00d7 24-pdrs), 10 mortars and 5 howitzers pounded the city from a distance of 500\u2013800 m. By the end of the day [[San Salvador de la Punta Fortress|Fort la Punta]] was silenced. Prado had no other choice left but to surrender.<ref>Guiteras pp. 146-147</ref>\n\nThe next day negotiations of the articles of capitulation went on, and Prado and his army obtained the honours of war on 13 August.<ref>Guiteras pp. 149,163</ref> Hevia neglected to burn his fleet which fell intact in the hands of the British.\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Dominic Serres the Elder - The Captured Spanish Fleet at Havana, August-September 1762.jpg|thumb|left|The Captured Spanish Fleet at Havana, August\u2013September 1762, by Dominic Serres]]\nOn 14 August the British entered the city. They had obtained possession of the most important harbour in the [[Spanish West Indies]] along with military equipment, 1,828,116 Spanish pesos and merchandise valued around 1,000,000 Spanish pesos. Furthermore, they had seized 20% of the ships of the line of the Spanish Navy, namely ''Aquil\u00f3n'' (74), ''Conquistador'' (74), ''Reina'' (70), ''San Antonio'' (64), ''Tigre'' (70), ''San Jenaro'' (60), ''\u00c1frica'' (70), ''Am\u00e9rica'' (60), ''Infante'' (74) and ''Soberano'' (74), together with 3 frigates, 9 smaller vessels including the ''Marte'' (18) commanded by [[Domingo de Bonechea]] and some armed vessels belonging to trading companies (Compa\u00f1\u00eda de La Habana and Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Caracas). Furthermore, two new almost-completed ships of the line were seized in the dockyards \u2013 ''San Carlos'' (80) and ''Santiago'' (60 or 80). [[Prize money payments]] of \u00a3122,697 each were made to Pocock as naval commander and to Albemarle as military commander, with \u00a324,539 paid to  [[Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel|Commodore Keppel]], the naval second-in-command who was Albemarle's younger brother. Each of the 42 naval captains present received \u00a31,600 as prize money.<ref>Roger p. 257</ref> The military second-in-command,  [[George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield|Lieutenant-General Eliott]], received the same amount as Commodore Keppel, as the two shared a fifteenth part of the prize pool, as against the third shared by their commanders.<ref>Pockock p. 216</ref>\n\n[[File:The Piazza at Havana RMG BHC0418.tiff|thumb|British troops at the [[Plaza Vieja, Havana|Plaza Vieja]] during their occupation of Havana]]\nDuring the siege the British had lost 2,764 killed, wounded, captured or deserted,<ref name=\"Marley291\"/> but by 18 October also had lost 4,708 dead from sickness.<ref name=\"Diefendorf\">Diefendorf p. 202</ref> One of the most depleted brigades was transferred to North America where it lost a further 360 men within a month of arrival. Three ships of the line were lost either as a direct result of Spanish gunfire or severe damage received which would cause their demise later. Shortly after the siege {{HMS|Stirling Castle|1742|6}} was declared unserviceable and was stripped and scuttled.<ref>Winfield p. 49</ref> [[HMS St Michael (1669)|HMS ''Marlborough'']] sank in the Atlantic due to extensive damage received during the siege, and {{HMS|Temple|1758|6}} was lost while returning to Britain for repairs.<ref>Lavery p. 177</ref>\n\nOn their return to Spain Prado and Hevia were court-martialed and convicted.\n\nThe loss of Havana and Western Cuba was a serious blow to Spain. Not only were the financial losses considerable, the loss in prestige was even greater. This defeat, together with the [[Battle of Manila (1762)|conquest of Manila by the British]] one and a half months later, meant the loss of Spain's 'Key to the New World and Rampart of the West Indies' as well as its colonial capital of the [[Spanish East Indies]].<ref name=\"Schneider6\">Schneider p. 6</ref> This confirmed British [[naval supremacy]], and showed the fragility of the [[Spanish Empire]]. Just as the earlier [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] had forced the British government into a thorough review of its military, this war forced the Spanish government into undertaking a similar process. The invasions of Navana and Manilla were the catalyst for profound political and military reforms in the Spanish overseas empire.<ref name=\"Schneider222\">Schneider p. 222</ref>\n\nHavana and Manila were returned to Spain as a result of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] signed in February 1763, but the British occupation lasted until April 1763, when a newly appointed  [[Captaincy General of Cuba|Captain General of Cuba]] arrived to re-establish Spanish rule.

British forces besieged and captured the city of [[Havana]], which at the time was an important [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] naval base in the [[Caribbean]], and dealt a serious blow to the [[Spanish Navy]]. Havana was subsequently returned to Spain under the 1763 [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] that formally ended the war.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Anglo-Spanish War (1762\u20131763)}}\nHavana in the late 18th century was a major port and naval base, and also the strongest fortress in Spanish America. Its royal shipyard with access to abundant supplies of resistant hardwoods was capable of building [[first-rate]] warships and had been developed by the Bourbon monarchy as the most important of its three naval shipyards.<ref name=\"Roger50\">Roger p. 50</ref><ref name=\"Schneider72-73\">Schneider pp. 72-73</ref> There had been several previous plans to attack Havana, including one proposed to [[Edward Vernon|Vernon]] in 1739, which he rejected in favour of an attack on  [[Battle of Porto Bello|Portobello]],<ref name=\"Bradley201\">Bradley p. 201</ref> but no successful attack since it was comprehensively fortified,<ref name=\"Schneider21\">Schneider p. 21</ref> and the strength of its fortifications and difficulty that large sailing warships would have in making an undetected approach from the north convinced the Spanish commanders it would be virtually impossible to capture, if its fortifications were in good order and it was properly garrisoned. Its wealth and ability to feed its population also suggested that it could resist being starved into surrender.<ref name=\"Roger50-51\">Roger pp. 50-51</ref><ref name=\"Schneider61,106\">Schneider pp. 61,106</ref>\n\nBritain had been formally at war with France since May 1756, but Spain under [[Ferdinand VI of Spain| Ferdinand VI]] remained neutral. After Ferdinand's death on 1759, his half-brother [[Charles III of Spain| Charles III]] reversed Ferdinand's policy and, by the [[Treaty of Paris (1761)]], re-established the so-called [[Pacte de Famille| Family Compact]] between France and Spain. This treaty involved an offensive alliance directed against Britain, and in December 1761, Spain placed an [[Economic sanctions| embargo]] on British trade, seized British goods and expelled British merchants. In response to this, Britain declared war on Spain in January 1762.<ref>Danley and Speelman pp. 431-432</ref> \n\n===Spanish preparations===\nBefore involving his country in the conflict raging in Europe and across the world, Charles III made provisions to defend the [[Spanish colonies]] against the [[British Royal Navy]]. For the defence of Cuba, he appointed [[Juan de Prado Mayera Portocarrero y Luna|Juan de Prado]] as commander-in-chief.  De Prado arrived at [[Havana]] in February 1761 and began work to improve the fortifications of the city.<ref name=\"Schneider82\">Schneider p. 82</ref>\n\nIn June 1761, a flotilla of seven [[ships of the line]] under the command of Admiral [[Gutierre de Hevia]] arrived at Havana, transporting two regular infantry regiments (Espa\u00f1a and Arag\u00f3n) totalling 996 men, bringing the Havana garrison to 2,400 regular infantry. There were also 6,300 sailors and marines aboard the ships.<ref>Greentree p. 15</ref> However, [[yellow fever]] had reduced the defending forces of the city by the time the siege began to 1,900 regular infantry, 750 marines, around 5,000 sailors and 2,000 to 3,000 armed militia, besides several thousand more without firearms or training.<ref>Greentree p. 20</ref> The main garrison consisted of:\n[[File:A plan of the Havana and its environs, with the several posts and attacks by Thomas Kitchin.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A plan of Havana and its environs in 1762, by [[Thomas Kitchen]]]]\n* Espa\u00f1a Infantry Regiment (481)\n* Arag\u00f3n Infantry Regiment (265)\n* Havana Infantry Regiment (856)\n* Edinburgh's Dragoons (150)\n* Army's gunners (104)\n* Navy's gunners and marines (750)\n\nHavana had one of the finest natural harbours in the [[West Indies]] with a 180&nbsp;m wide and 800&nbsp;m long entrance channel giving access to the harbour. Two strong [[fortress]]es defended the entrance channel; on the north side of the channel stood the very strong ''Castillo de los Tres Reyes del Morro'' (known in English as [[Morro Castle (Havana)|Morro Castle]]) on the rocky Cavannos Ridge. It had 64 heavy guns and was garrisoned by 700 men. However, it had been noted that most of its guns faced Havana's port and bay, and that it was overlooked by the unfortified hill of La Cabana. Although it had been proposed to fortify La Cabana, the project had been delayed and no guns had been installed there.<ref>Greentree p. 30</ref>The south side was defended by the older ''[[San Salvador de la Punta Fortress|Castillo de San Salvador de la Punta]]''.<ref name=\"Schneider68\">Schneider p. 68</ref> The channel could also be blocked by a [[boom (navigational barrier)|boom chain]] extending from El Morro to La Punta. Havana itself lay on the south side along the channel and was surrounded by a wall {{convert|5|km|mi}} long.<ref name=\"Schneider54\">Schneider p. 54</ref>\n\n===British preparations===\nTwo days after the declaration of war with Spain, on the advice of [[George Anson, 1st Baron Anson| Lord Anson]], the British cabinet chose Havana as a major objective in its attack on Spain because of its strategic importance, believing that its permanent loss would weaken Spanish influence in the Caribbean. Detailed plans were made for a combined naval and military attack on Havana, relying on the Royal Navy's superiority in numbers and effectiveness over the Spanish fleet. Vice-Admiral Sir [[George Pocock]], with seven ships-of-the-line and a frigate, was to transport a military force under the command of [[George Keppel, 3rd Earl of Albemarle]] to the [[West Indies]], to join the West Indies naval squadron, then under the command of [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney| Rear-Admiral Rodney, who was commanding operations against [[Martinique]], taking on additional troops and proceeding to the northwest of [[Haiti]] to embark 4,000 men from the British colonies in North America, commanded by [[Jeffrey Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffrey Amherst]]. It was to keep its final destination in doubt until it launched its amphibious attack on Havana.<ref name=\"Bradley223-224\">Bradley pp. 223-224</ref> These plans were modified to meet circumstances, as Rodney and [[Robert Monckton| General ]Monckton] commanding the troops had captured Martinique before Pocock sailed, 3,000 British and American troops from New York did not arrive at Havana until late July, and the plan to take up to 2,000 slaves from [[Jamaica]] to act as [[Pioneer (military)| pioneers]] only produced 600 slaves, as many owners were reluctant to part with them.<ref name=\"Bradley224-225\">Bradley pp. 224-225</ref> A plan by Amherst to assemble a force of 8,000 men for an attack on [[French Louisiana|Louisiana]] was dismissed by Albemarle as impractical.<ref>Danley and Speelman p.320</ref>\n\nDuring the month of February, British troops embarked; they consisted of:\n* [[Cheshire regiment|22nd Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[34th Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[56th Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[72nd Richmond's Regiment of Foot]]\n\nOn 5 March the British expedition sailed from [[Spithead]], England, with 7 ships of the line and 4,365 men aboard 64 transports, and arrived in [[Barbados]] on 20 April.  Five days later the expedition reached [[Fort-de-France|Fort Royal]] on the recently conquered island of [[Martinique]] where it picked up the remainder of Major-General [[Robert Monckton]]'s expedition, still numbering 8,461 men. Rear Admiral [[George Rodney]]'s squadron, amounting to 8 ships of the line also joined the expedition bringing the total number of ships of the line to 15.\n\nOn 23 May the expedition, now off the northwest corner of Saint-Domingue (present-day [[Haiti]]), was further reinforced by [[Sir James Douglas, 1st Baronet|Sir James Douglas]]' squadron from [[Port Royal, Jamaica]]. The force under Albemarle now amounted to 21 ships of the line, 24 lesser warships, and 168 other vessels, carrying some 14,000 seamen and marines plus another 3,000 hired sailors and 12,826 regulars.\n{{wide image|L'escadre anglaise pour attaquer La Havane en 1762.jpg|800px|align-cap=center|General view of the English squadron}}\n\n==Siege==\nThe  normal approach to Havana, on the north coast of Cuba, was to sail west parallel to the south coast of the island on the prevailing south-easterly wind, then to round its western tip and sail east towards Havana, against the wind. This last section, more than 200 [[mile]]s ling, would take a large squadron at least one week, and probably several, giving ample warning for Havana to prepare. To the north of Havana, as far as [[the Bahamas]] is a wide expanse of shallow water, [[reef]]s and small islands or [[cay]s], accessible only to small boats except for one deep water channel, the [[Old Bahama Channel]] which is only some 10 miles wide at its narrowest. Although the Spanish navigators that charted it thought too dangerous for large warships, it was surveyed by a British frigate, whose captain left parties of his men in the cays to mark the extremities of the channel, allowing the whole fleet to pass through it, safely and undetected.<ref name=\"Bradley225\">Bradley p. 225</ref><ref name=\"Roger50-52\">Roger pp. 50-52</ref>    \n\nOn 6 June the British force came into sight of Havana. Immediately, 12 British ships of the line were sent to the mouth of the entrance channel to block in the Spanish fleet. The British planned to begin the operations by the reduction of the Morro fortress, on the north side of the channel, through a formal [[Vauban]]-style siege. The commanding position of this fort over the city would then force the Spanish commander to surrender. However, this plan did not take into account the fact that the fortress was located on a rocky promontory where it was impossible to dig approach trenches and that a large ditch cut into the rock protected the fort on the land side.\n[[File:Standard guide to Cuba - a new and complete guide to the island of Cuba, with maps, illustrations, routes of travel, history, and an English-Spanish phrase book (1909) (14801359763).jpg|thumb|Map of the Siege]]\n\nThe Spanish force under Prado and Admiral Hevia, surprised by the size of the attacking force, adopted a delaying defensive strategy. It had several advantages besides the hope of a relief force. Firstly, the [[hurricane]] season would begin in late August, putting the British fleet in danger: the wet weather starting earlier in that month would probably also initiate an outbreak of [[yellow fever]] among the besiegers.<ref name=\"Schneider126-127\">Schneider pp. 126-127</ref> Secondly, despite some losses from tropical diseases Prado had 1,500 Spanish regular soldiers and some 2,300 colonial [[militiamen]], as well as sailors from the fleet. The ships of the Spanish fleet was kept in the harbour while its sailors, gunners and marines were sent to garrison the fortresses of Morro and Punta which were placed under the command of naval officers.<ref name=\"Schneider121\">Schneider p. 121</ref> Most of the shot and powder of the fleet as well as its best guns were also transferred to these two fortresses. Meanwhile, regular troops were assigned to the defence of the city. Prado also ordered all women, children and the old and infirm to leave the city, leaving only men able to bear arms.<ref name=\"Schneider135\">Schneider p. 135</ref>\n\nThe channel entrance was immediately closed with the [[boom (navigational barrier)|boom chain]]. Furthermore, 3 ships of the line (''Asia'' (64), ''Europa'' (64) and ''Neptuno'' (74)) were selected among the fleet for their poor condition and sunk behind the boom chain. Realising the importance of the Morro, the Spanish commanders gave it top priority.<ref name=\"Schneider122\">Schneider p. 122</ref>\n\nThe following day British troops were landed northeast of Havana, and began advancing west the next day.<ref>Guiteras pp. 79-80</ref> They met a militia party that was easily pushed back. By the end of the day, British infantry had reached the vicinity of Havana.<ref>Pockock p. 221</ref>  The defence of the Morro was assigned to [[Luis Vicente de Velasco e Isla]], a naval officer, who immediately took measures to prepare and provision the fortress for a siege.<ref name=\"Schneider121\">Schneider p. 121</ref>\n\n===Siege of El Morro===\n[[File:LindsayCambridge.jpg|thumb|left|Bombardment of the Morro Castle, Havana, 1 July 1762 by [[Richard Paton]]]]\nOn 11 June a British party stormed a detached redoubt on the Cavannos heights.<ref>Guiteras p. 84</ref> Only then did the British command realise how strong the Morro was, surrounded by brushwood and protected by a large ditch.<ref>Pockock p. 226</ref>  With the arrival of their siege train the next day, the British began erecting batteries among the trees on La Cabana hill overlooking the Morro (some {{convert|7|m|ft}} higher) as well as the city and the bay. Surprisingly, this hill had been left undefended by the Spanish army despite its well-known strategic importance.<ref>Pockock p. 227</ref>  The king of Spain had even instructed Prado to fortify this hill, a task that he considered the most urgent among those confided to his commander.<ref name=\"Bradley226-227\">Bradley pp. 226-227</ref>\n\nTwo days later a British detachment landed at [[Torre\u00f3n de la Chorrera]], on the west side of the harbour. Meanwhile, Colonel [[Patrick Mackellar]], an engineer, was overseeing the construction of the siege works against the Morro.<ref>Pockock pp. 223-224</ref> Since digging trenches was impossible, he resolved to erect breastworks instead.<ref name=\"Bradley227-228\">Bradley pp. 227-228</ref> He planned to mine towards a bastion of the Morro once his siege works would have reached the ditch and to create a runway across this ditch with the rubble produced by his mining activities.\n\nBy 22 June, four British batteries totalling twelve heavy guns and 38 mortars opened fire on the Morro from La Cabana. Mackellar gradually advanced his breastworks towards the ditch under cover of these batteries so by the end of the month the British had increased their daily direct hits on the Morro to 500.<ref>Pockock p. 229</ref>  Velasco was losing as many as 30 men each day, and the workload of repairing the fortress every night was so exhausting that men had to be rotated into the fort from the city every three days. Velasco finally managed to convince Prado that a raid was necessary against the British batteries. At dawn on 29 June 988 men (a mixed company of grenadiers, marines, engineers, and slaves) attacked the siege works. They reached the British batteries from the rear and started to spike guns, but British reaction was swift, and the attackers were repulsed before they caused any serious damage.<ref>Pockock pp. 230-231</ref>\n[[File:Dominic Serres the Elder - The Capture of Havana, 1762, the English Battery before Morro Castle.jpg|thumb|300px|right|British siege guns before Morro Castle, by Dominic Serres]]\n\nOn 1 July, the British launched a combined land and naval attack on the Morro. The fleet detached four ships of the line for this purpose: [[HMS Stirling Castle (1742)|HMS ''Stirling Castle'']], [[HMS Dragon (1760)|HMS ''Dragon'']], [[HMS St Michael (1669)|HMS ''Marlborough'']] and [[HMS Cambridge (1755)|HMS ''Cambridge'']].<ref>Guiteras pp. 95-96</ref> The naval and land artillery simultaneously opened fire on the Morro. However, naval guns were ineffective, the fort being located too high.<ref>Pockock pp. 231-232</ref>  Counter-fire from thirty guns of the Morro inflicted 192 casualties and seriously damaged the ships, one of which was later scuttled, forcing them to withdraw. Meanwhile, the bombardment by the land artillery was far more effective. By the end of the day, only three Spanish guns were still effective on the side of the Morro facing the British batteries. The next day however British breastworks around the Morro caught fire and the batteries were burned down, destroying the product of much of the work undertaken since mid June.<ref>Pockock p. 237</ref> Velasco immediately capitalised on this event, remounting many guns and repairing breaches in the fortifications of the Morro.<ref>Guiteras p. 97</ref>\n\nSince its arrival at Havana, the British army had heavily suffered from [[yellow fever]] and was now at half strength. Since the [[Atlantic hurricane season|hurricane season]] was approaching, Albemarle was now engaged in a race against time. He ordered the batteries to be rebuilt with the help of men of the fleet. Many [[32-pounder gun]]s were taken from the lower deck of several ships to equip these new batteries.\n\nBy 17 July the new British batteries had progressively silenced most of Velasco's guns, leaving only two of them operational. With the absence of artillery cover, it now became impossible for the Spanish troops to repair the damage being inflicted on the Morro.<ref>Guiteras p. 104</ref> Mackellar was also able to resume construction of siege works to approach the fortress. With the army in such a bad condition, work progressed rather slowly. All hope of the British army now resided in the expected arrival of reinforcements from North America.\n\nThe progress of siege works over the next few days allowed the British to begin the mining towards the right bastion of the Morro.<ref>Guiteras pp. 104-105</ref> Meanwhile, the now unopposed British artillery was daily hitting the Morro up to 600 times, causing some sixty casualties. Velasco had now no hope but to destroy British siege works and so on 22 July 1,300 regulars, seamen and militia sallied from Havana in three columns and attacked the siege works surrounding the Morro. The British repelled the Spanish sortie who thus withdrew to their lines and the siege works were left relatively intact.<ref>Guiteras pp. 107-108</ref>\n[[File:Joshua reynolds, ritratto del general maggiore william keppel, 1762-65 ca.jpg|thumb|left|General [[William Keppel (British Army officer, born 1727)|William Keppel]], ''Storming the Morro Castle'', by [[Joshua Reynolds]]]]\n\nOn 24 July Albemarle offered Velasco the opportunity to surrender, allowing him to write his own terms of capitulation. Velasco answered that the issue would rather be settled by force of arms. Three days later the reinforcements from North America led by Colonel Burton finally arrived.<ref>Guiteras pp. 116-117</ref> During their journey, they had been attacked by the French, who captured some 500 men. These reinforcements consisted of:\n* [[46th (South Devonshire) Regiment of Foot|46th Thomas Murray's Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[58th (Rutlandshire) Regiment of Foot|58th Anstruther's Regiment of Foot]]\n* American provincials (3,000 men)\n* [[Gorham's Rangers|Gorham's]] and [[Danks' Rangers]] - which were combined into a 253-man ranger corps.\n\nOn 29 July the mine near the right bastion of the Morro fort was completed and ready to explode.<ref name=\"Schneider151\">Schneider p. 151</ref> Albemarle vainly feigned an assault, hoping that Velasco would finally decide to surrender. On the contrary, Velasco decided to launched a desperate attack from the sea upon the British miners in the ditch.<ref>Pockock p. 239</ref> At 2:00 am the next day two Spanish schooners attacked the miners from the sea. Their attack was unsuccessful and they had to withdraw. At 1:00 pm the British finally detonated the mine. The debris of the explosion partly filled the ditch but Albemarle judged it passable,<ref name=\"Schneider155\">Schneider p. 155</ref> and launched an assault, sending 699 picked men against the right bastion. Before the Spanish could react, sixteen men gained a foothold on the bastion.<ref>Pockock p. 241</ref> Velasco rushed to the breach with his troops, and was mortally wounded during the ensuing hand-to-hand fighting. The Spanish troops fell back, leaving the British in control of the Morro fort.<ref>Guiteras pp. 124-125</ref> Velasco was transported back to Havana, but by 31 July had died of his wounds.<ref name=\"Schneider151,225\">Schneider pp. 151, 225</ref>\n\nThe British then occupied a position commanding the city of Havana as well as the bay.<ref>Pockock p. 244</ref> Artillery batteries were brought up along the north side of the entrance channel from the Morro fort to La Cabana hill, where they could be trained directly on the town.<ref>Guiteras p. 142</ref>\n[[File:Spanish flag RMG RP-76-19.jpg|thumb|300px|Parts of a patched Spanish flag captured during the assault on Moro Castle, showing arms of [[Castille and Leon]] with [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon arms]] in centre surrounded by [[Order of the Golden Fleece]] (from [[Royal Museums Greenwich]])]]\n\n===Surrender===\nOn 11 August, after Prado had rejected the demand for surrender sent to him by Albemarle, the British batteries opened fire on Havana.<ref>Guiteras p. 144</ref> A total of 47 guns (15 \u00d7 32-pdrs, 32 \u00d7 24-pdrs), 10 mortars and 5 howitzers pounded the city from a distance of 500\u2013800 m. By the end of the day [[San Salvador de la Punta Fortress|Fort la Punta]] was silenced. Prado had no other choice left but to surrender.<ref>Guiteras pp. 146-147</ref>\n\nThe next day negotiations of the articles of capitulation went on, and Prado and his army obtained the honours of war on 13 August.<ref>Guiteras pp. 149,163</ref> Hevia neglected to burn his fleet which fell intact in the hands of the British.\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Dominic Serres the Elder - The Captured Spanish Fleet at Havana, August-September 1762.jpg|thumb|left|The Captured Spanish Fleet at Havana, August\u2013September 1762, by Dominic Serres]]\nOn 14 August the British entered the city. They had obtained possession of the most important harbour in the [[Spanish West Indies]] along with military equipment, 1,828,116 Spanish pesos and merchandise valued around 1,000,000 Spanish pesos. Furthermore, they had seized 20% of the ships of the line of the Spanish Navy, namely ''Aquil\u00f3n'' (74), ''Conquistador'' (74), ''Reina'' (70), ''San Antonio'' (64), ''Tigre'' (70), ''San Jenaro'' (60), ''\u00c1frica'' (70), ''Am\u00e9rica'' (60), ''Infante'' (74) and ''Soberano'' (74), together with 3 frigates, 9 smaller vessels including the ''Marte'' (18) commanded by [[Domingo de Bonechea]] and some armed vessels belonging to trading companies (Compa\u00f1\u00eda de La Habana and Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Caracas). Furthermore, two new almost-completed ships of the line were seized in the dockyards \u2013 ''San Carlos'' (80) and ''Santiago'' (60 or 80). [[Prize money payments]] of \u00a3122,697 each were made to Pocock as naval commander and to Albemarle as military commander, with \u00a324,539 paid to  [[Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel|Commodore Keppel]], the naval second-in-command who was Albemarle's younger brother. Each of the 42 naval captains present received \u00a31,600 as prize money.<ref>Roger p. 257</ref> The military second-in-command,  [[George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield|Lieutenant-General Eliott]], received the same amount as Commodore Keppel, as the two shared a fifteenth part of the prize pool, as against the third shared by their commanders.<ref>Pockock p. 216</ref>\n\n[[File:The Piazza at Havana RMG BHC0418.tiff|thumb|British troops at the [[Plaza Vieja, Havana|Plaza Vieja]] during their occupation of Havana]]\nDuring the siege the British had lost 2,764 killed, wounded, captured or deserted,<ref name=\"Marley291\"/> but by 18 October also had lost 4,708 dead from sickness.<ref name=\"Diefendorf\">Diefendorf p. 202</ref> One of the most depleted brigades was transferred to North America where it lost a further 360 men within a month of arrival.

Not only were the financial losses considerable, the loss in prestige was even greater. This defeat, together with the [[Battle of Manila (1762)|conquest of Manila by the British]] one and a half months later, meant the loss of Spain's 'Key to the New World and Rampart of the West Indies' as well as its colonial capital of the [[Spanish East Indies]].<ref name=\"Schneider6\">Schneider p. 6</ref> This confirmed British [[naval supremacy]], and showed the fragility of the [[Spanish Empire]]. Just as the earlier [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] had forced the British government into a thorough review of its military, this war forced the Spanish government into undertaking a similar process. The invasions of Navana and Manilla were the catalyst for profound political and military reforms in the Spanish overseas empire.<ref name=\"Schneider222\">Schneider p. 222</ref>\n\nHavana and Manila were returned to Spain as a result of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] signed in February 1763, but the British occupation lasted until April 1763, when a newly appointed  [[Captaincy General of Cuba|Captain General of Cuba]] arrived to re-establish Spanish rule. Spain was required to cede [[Spanish Florida|Florida]] and [[Menorca]] to Great Britain and pay the [[Manila Ransom]].<ref name=\"Schneider219, 224\">Schneider pp. 219, 224</ref> Spain received [[French Louisiana]] as a payment for intervening in the war on the side of the French and as compensation for having lost Florida.<ref name=\"Schneider225\">Schneider p. 225</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\nNumerous paintings and drawings of the battle were made, notably by [[Dominic Serres]]:\n<gallery widths=\"145\" heights=\"115\">\nFile:Dominic Serres the Elder - The Capture of Havana, 1762- The Morro Castle and the Boom Defence Before the Attack.jpg|The Morro Castle and the [[boom (navigational barrier)|Boom Defence]] Before the Attack\nFile:Dominic Serres the Elder - The Capture of Havana, 1762- the Landing, 7th June.jpg|The Landing, 7 June\nFile:Dominic Serres the Elder - The Capture of Havana, 1762, Landing Cannon and Stores, 30 June.jpg|Landing Cannon and Stores, 30 June\nFile:Dominic Serres the Elder - The Capture of Havana, 1762.jpg|Approach of British forces before Morro Castle\nFile:The Capture of Havana, 1762- Storming of Morro Castle, 30 July RMG L6229.tiff|Storming of Morro Castle, 30 July\nFile:British ships in the Seven Years War before Havana.jpg|Bombardment of the Morro Castle ([[Rafael Monle\u00f3n]])\nFile:El Morro.jpg|[[Castillo de los Tres Reyes Magos del Morro|El Morro fortress]] in Havana, built in 1589\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n===Further reading===\n* {{cite book|last1=Bradley|first1=Peter|title=British Maritime Enterprise in the New World: From the Late Fifteenth to the Mid-eighteenth Century|date=1999|publisher=Edwin Mellen Press Ltd|isbn=9780773478664}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Brumwell|first1=Stephen|title=Redcoats: The British Soldier and War in the Americas, 1755\u20131763|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521807832}}\n* Danley, Mark and Speelman, Patrick (2012).

After a brief service in the {{USS|Sabine|1855|2}} he was given a presidential appointment soon afterwards to enter the [[U.S. Naval Academy]] on July 27, 1866, graduating from that institution on June 7, 1870, as a passed [[midshipman]]. He received his commission as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] in November 1873 after a series of cruises onboard screw [[sloops]].\n\n\n==Naval career==\nVreeland was further promoted to master and then [[lieutenant]] after successive tours of duty on board the [[steamboat|screw steamer]] {{USS|Alert|AS-4|2}}, the [[gunboat]] {{USS|Ashuelot|1865|2}} and the [[sloop-of-war]] {{USS|Ticonderoga|1863|2}}. He was then assigned to the [[United States Naval Observatory|Nautical Almanac Office]] of the [[US Naval Observatory]] in November 1881 after a brief period ashore awaiting orders. In March 1884, Lt. Vreeland began a three-year tour at sea aboard the sloop-of-war {{USS|Hartford|1858|2}}, after which he was assigned for two years at the [[Bureau of Navigation (United States Navy)|Bureau of Navigation]]. He was then assigned briefly (from July to September 1889) with the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]] and reported to the [[United States Coast Survey|Coast Survey]] late in October, a posting he took until the spring of 1893, when Vreeland was assigned a series of tours as naval attach\u00e9 \u2014 first in [[Rome, Italy|Rome]], [[Vienna, Austria|Vienna]] and finally in [[Berlin, Germany|Berlin]].\n\nAfter returning home in late 1896, Lt. Vreeland was posted to the [[battleship]] {{USS|Massachusetts|BB-2|2}} in mid-January 1897, and served aboard her until he was transferred to the [[gunboat]] {{USS|Helena|PG-9|2}} at the end of June, whereupon he served through most of the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] on blockade duty off the port of [[Manzanillo, Cuba|Manzanillo]] until the end of July 1898, even though he was named [[executive officer]] of the [[cruiser]] {{USS|Dolphin|PG-24|2}} in April of that year. He did not actually assume those duties until August 24. He was detached from the ''Dolphin'' to serve aboard the {{USS|Olympia|C-6|2}} on November 6 that same year, but was ordered to the {{USS|Concord|PG-3|2}} instead on December 30 due to change in orders. Vreeland was promoted to [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|lieutenant commander]], and served aboard various vessels in the [[Asiatic Squadron]]. He returned home on board the [[hospital ship]] {{USS|Solace|AH-2|2}} in March 1900. From April 1900 to before August 1902 he was a member of the [[Board of Inspection and Survey]], during which time he was promoted to full [[commander]] in mid-August 1901. After his duty in the Board, he supervised the fitting out of the new monitor {{USS|Arkansas|BM-7|2}} (later renamed the ''Ozark'') and assumed command upon her commissioning on October 28 of that year.\n\nTwo years later, Vreeland relinquished command of the ''Ozark'' and served on shore a series of special assignments for the [[Department of the Navy]] for the next few years, during which he received his promotion to [[Captain (United States)|captain]] on April 13, 1906. After finishing his on-shore assignments in [[Washington, D.C.]] on April 17, 1907, Capt. Vreeland went to [[New York Shipbuilding Corporation|New York Ship]] in [[Camden, New Jersey]] the next day to commission the new {{sclass-|Connecticut|battleship}} {{USS|Kansas|BB-21|2}}. He commanded the battleship for the next two years, which was an auspicious time, for the ''Kansas'' was picked to be part of the \"[[Great White Fleet]]\" that sailed around the world. Soon after the Fleet returned to [[Hampton Roads]] on February 22, 1909, he gave up his command of the ''Kansas'' and returned home to await orders. On May 10, he succeeded Captain [[Raymond P. Rodgers]] as Chief Intelligence Officer, the head of the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]] until December 8, when he was succeeded by Captain [[Templin M. Potts]]. \n\nAs his promotion to rear admiral was becoming imminent, he broke his flag in the {{USS|Virginia|BB-13|2}} as Commander, 4th Division, [[United States Atlantic Fleet|Atlantic Fleet]]. On December 27, he became Rear Admiral Charles Vreeland.\n\nOn April 19, 1911, he reported ashore for further duty in Washington. In the newly devised aide system for managing the Navy, Vreeland became one of the four principal advisors of the [[Secretary of the Navy]], [[George von Lengerke Meyer]]. As Aide for Inspections, he reached the pinnacle of naval command. During his tenure, he represented the Navy at the coronation of [[George V of the United Kingdom]], as well as heading the so-called \"Vreeland Board\" which reinvestigated the sinking of the {{USS|Maine|ACR-1|2}} in 1898, the controversial report of which  \u2014 now widely regarded as erroneous \u2014 concluded that an external explosion sank the ''Maine''.\n\nOn December 12, Rear Admiral Vreeland ended his tour of duty as Aide for Inspections and succeeded Rear Admiral [[Richard Wainwright (Rear Admiral)|Richard Wainwright]] as the second Aide for Operations. While in that position, Vreeland struggled to improve the defenses in the [[Philippines|Philippine Islands]], agitated for increased naval construction, particularly of [[battlecruiser]]s, and supported the development of U.S. [[naval aviation]]. It was also during his tenure that naval aviation found a permanent home in [[Pensacola, Florida]]. On February 11, 1903, he was succeeded by [[Bradley Fiske|Bradley A. Fiske]] as Aide for Operations, and Vreeland finished out his naval career as member of both the General and Joint Boards. He retired on March 10, 1914.\n\nRear Admiral Charles E.

A SOA service is a discrete unit of functionality that can be accessed remotely and acted upon and updated independently, such as retrieving a credit card statement online. SOA is also intended to be independent of vendors, products and technologies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb833022.aspx|title=Chapter 1: Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)|website=msdn.microsoft.com|access-date=2016-09-21|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206132542/https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb833022.aspx |archivedate=February 6, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nA service has four properties according to one of many definitions of SOA:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.opengroup.org/standards/soa|title=Service-Oriented Architecture Standards - The Open Group|website=www.opengroup.org}}</ref>\n# It logically represents a business activity with a specified outcome.\n# It is self-contained.\n# It is a [[black box]] for its consumers, meaning the consumer does not have to be aware of the service's inner workings.\n# It may consist of other underlying services.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.opengroup.org/soa/source-book/soa/soa.htm |title=What Is SOA? |website=www.opengroup.org |access-date=2016-09-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819141303/http://opengroup.org/soa/source-book/soa/soa.htm |archivedate=August 19, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nDifferent services can be used in conjunction to provide the functionality of a large [[Software applications|software application]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cloud Computing: A Practical Approach|last=Velte|first=Anthony T.|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2010|isbn=978-0-07-162694-1|location=|pages=|via=}}</ref> a principle SOA shares with [[modular programming]]. Service-oriented architecture integrates distributed, separately maintained and deployed software components. It is enabled by technologies and standards that facilitate components' communication and cooperation over a network, especially over an IP network.\n\nSOA is related to the idea of an [[application programming interface]] (API), an interface or communication protocol between different parts of a computer program intended to simplify the implementation and maintenance of software.  An API can be thought of as the service, and the SOA the architecture that allows the service to operate.\n\n== Overview ==\nIn SOA, services use protocols that describe how they [[Message passing|pass]] and parse messages using description [[metadata]]. This metadata describes both the functional characteristics of the service and quality-of-service characteristics. Service-oriented architecture aims to allow users to combine large chunks of functionality to form applications which are built purely from existing services and combining them in an ad hoc manner. A service presents a simple interface to the requester that abstracts away the underlying complexity acting as a black box. Further users can also access these independent services without any knowledge of their internal implementation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/library/ws-migratesoa/ |title=Migrating to a service-oriented architecture, Part 1 |date=2008-12-09 |access-date=2016-09-21 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209120916/http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/library/ws-migratesoa/ |archivedate=December 9, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n== Defining concepts ==\nThe related buzzword [[service-orientation]] promotes ''[[loose coupling]]'' between services.

One example is [[SOAP]], which has gained broad industry acceptance after recommendation of Version 1.2 from the W3C<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/2003/06/soap12-pressrelease |title=SOAP Version 1.2 \u306e\u516c\u958b\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066 (W3C \u52e7\u544a) |language=ja |publisher=W3.org |accessdate=August 13, 2012 }}</ref> (World Wide Web Consortium) in 2003. These standards (also referred to as [[List of web service specifications|web service specifications]]) also provide greater interoperability and some protection from lock-in to proprietary vendor software. One can, however, also implement SOA using any other service-based technology, such as [[Jini]], [[CORBA]] or [[Representational State Transfer|REST]].\n\nArchitectures can operate independently of specific technologies and can therefore be implemented using a wide range of technologies, including:\n* [[Web services]] based on WSDL and [[SOAP]]\n* Messaging, e.g., with ActiveMQ, JMS, RabbitMQ\n* RESTful HTTP, with [[Representational state transfer]] (REST) constituting its own constraints-based architectural style\n* [[OPC Unified Architecture|OPC-UA]]\n* [[Windows Communication Foundation|WCF]] (Microsoft's implementation of Web services, forming a part of WCF)\n* [[Apache Thrift]]\n* [[gRPC]]\n* [[SORCER]]\n\nImplementations can use one or more of these protocols and, for example, might use a file-system mechanism to communicate data following a defined interface specification between processes conforming to the SOA concept. The key is independent services with defined interfaces that can be called to perform their tasks in a standard way, without a service having foreknowledge of the calling application, and without the application having or needing knowledge of how the service actually performs its tasks. SOA enables the development of applications that are built by combining loosely coupled and [[interoperable]] services.\n\nThese services inter-operate based on a formal definition (or contract, e.g., WSDL) that is independent of the underlying platform and programming language. The interface definition [[Information hiding|hides the implementation]] of the language-specific service. SOA-based systems can therefore function independently of development technologies and platforms (such as Java, .NET, etc.). Services written in C# running on .NET platforms and services written in Java running on [[Java Platform, Enterprise Edition|Java EE]] platforms, for example, can both be consumed by a common composite application (or client). Applications running on either platform can also consume services running on the other as web services that facilitate reuse. Managed environments can also wrap COBOL legacy systems and present them as software services.<sup>[[Service-oriented architecture#cite note-23|.]]</sup><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fujitsu.com/global/documents/about/resources/publications/fstj/archives/vol42-3/paper18.pdf|title=. \"Case Study of System Architecture that use COBOL assets\"|last=Okishima|first=Haruhiru|date=2006|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n[[High-level programming language]]s such as [[BPEL]] and specifications such as [[WS-CDL]] and [[WS-Coordination]] extend the service concept by providing a method of defining and supporting orchestration of fine-grained services into more coarse-grained business services, which architects can in turn incorporate into workflows and business processes implemented in [[composite applications]] or [[Enterprise portal|portals]].\n\n[[Service-oriented modeling]] is an SOA framework that identifies the various disciplines that guide SOA practitioners to conceptualize, analyze, design, and architect their service-oriented assets. The [[Service-oriented modeling#Service-oriented modeling framework|Service-oriented modeling framework (SOMF)]] offers a modeling language and a work structure or \"map\" depicting the various components that contribute to a successful service-oriented modeling approach. It illustrates the major elements that identify the \"what to do\" aspects of a service development scheme. The model enables practitioners to craft a [[project plan]] and to identify the milestones of a service-oriented initiative. SOMF also provides a common modeling notation to address alignment between business and IT organizations.[[File:SOA Elements.png|thumb|450px|right|Elements of SOA, by Dirk Krafzig, Karl Banke, and Dirk Slama<ref>''Enterprise SOA''.

It can also simplify interconnection to\u2014and usage of\u2014existing IT (legacy) assets.\n\nWith SOA, the idea is that an organization can look at a problem holistically. A business has more overall control. Theoretically there would not be a mass of developers using whatever tool sets might please them. But rather they would be coding to a standard that is set within the business. They can also develop enterprise-wide SOA that encapsulates a business-oriented infrastructure. SOA has also been illustrated as a highway system providing efficiency for car drivers. The point being that if everyone had a car, but there was no highway anywhere, things would be limited and disorganized, in any attempt to get anywhere quickly or efficiently. IBM Vice President of Web Services Michael Liebow says that SOA \"builds highways\".<ref>Elizabeth Millard (January 2005). \"Building a Better Process\". ''Computer User''. Page 20.</ref>\n\nIn some respects, SOA could be regarded as an architectural evolution rather than as a revolution. It captures many of the [[best practice]]s of previous software architectures. In communications systems, for example, little development of solutions that use truly static bindings to talk to other equipment in the network has taken place. By embracing a SOA approach, such systems can position themselves to stress the importance of well-defined, highly inter-operable interfaces. Other predecessors of SOA include [[Component-based software engineering]] and Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) of remote objects, for instance, in [[CORBA]].\n\nA service comprises a stand-alone unit of functionality available only via a formally defined interface. Services can be some kind of \"nano-enterprises\" that are easy to produce and improve. Also services can be \"mega-corporations\" constructed as the coordinated work of subordinate services.\n\nReasons for treating the implementation of services as separate projects from larger projects include:\n# Separation promotes the concept to the business that services can be delivered quickly and independently from the larger and slower-moving projects common in the organization. The business starts understanding systems and simplified user interfaces calling on services. This advocates [[agility]]. That is to say, it fosters business innovations and speeds up time-to-market.<ref>Brayan Zimmerli (November 11, 2009) [https://web.archive.org/web/20101105063545/http://www.brayan.com/projects/BenefitsOfSOA/default.htm Business Benefits of SOA], ''University of Applied Science of Northwestern Switzerland, School of Business''</ref>\n# Separation promotes the decoupling of services from consuming projects. This encourages good design insofar as the service is designed without knowing who its consumers are.\n# Documentation and test artifacts of the service are not embedded within the detail of the larger project. This is important when the service needs to be reused later.\n\nSOA promises to simplify testing indirectly. Services are autonomous, stateless, with fully documented interfaces, and separate from the cross-cutting concerns of the implementation. If an organization possesses appropriately defined test data, then a corresponding stub is built that reacts to the test data when a service is being built. A full set of regression tests, scripts, data, and responses is also captured for the service. The service can be tested as a 'black box' using existing stubs corresponding to the services it calls. Test environments can be constructed where the primitive and out-of-scope services are stubs, while the remainder of the mesh is test deployments of full services. As each interface is fully documented with its own full set of regression test documentation, it becomes simple to identify problems in test services. Testing evolves to merely validate that the test service operates according to its documentation, and finds gaps in documentation and test cases of all services within the environment. Managing the data state of [[idempotent]] services is the only complexity.\n\nExamples may prove useful to aid in documenting a service to the level where it becomes useful. The documentation of some APIs within the Java Community Process provide good examples. As these are exhaustive, staff would typically use only important subsets. The 'ossjsa.pdf' file within [[Java Platform, Standard Edition|JSR-89]] exemplifies such a file.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110726070810/https://cds.sun.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/WFS/CDS-CDS_Developer-Site/en_US/-/USD/ViewProductDetail-Start?ProductRef=7854-oss_service_activation-1.0-fr-spec-oth-JSpec%40CDS-CDS_Developer JSR-000089 OSS Service Activation API Specification 1.0 Final Release]. sun.com</ref>\n\n== Criticism ==\nSOA has been conflated with [[Web service]]s;<ref>{{cite web|author=Joe McKendrick|title=Bray: SOA too complex; 'just vendor BS'|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/service-oriented/bray-soa-too-complex-just-vendor-bs/597|publisher=ZDNet}}</ref> however, Web services are only one option to implement the patterns that comprise the SOA style. In the absence of native or binary forms of remote procedure call (RPC), applications could run more slowly and require more processing power, increasing costs. Most implementations do incur these overheads, but SOA can be implemented using technologies (for example, [[Java Business Integration]] (JBI), [[Windows Communication Foundation]] (WCF) and [[data distribution service]] (DDS)) that do not depend on remote procedure calls or translation through XML or JSON. At the same time, emerging open-source XML parsing technologies (such as [[VTD-XML]]) and various XML-compatible binary formats promise to significantly improve SOA performance.<ref>Jimmy Zhang (February 20, 2008) [http://xml.sys-con.com/read/453082.htm \"Index XML Documents with VTD-XML\"].

This constraint has the drawback that it could reduce the overall [[scalability]] of the service provider if the service-provider needs to retain the shared context for each consumer. It also increases the coupling between a service provider and a consumer and makes switching service providers more difficult.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.jpmorgenthal.com/morgenthal/?p=31 | title=The Reason SOA Isn't Delivering Sustainable Software | date=June 19, 2009 | publisher=jpmorgenthal.com | accessdate=June 27, 2009 }}</ref> Ultimately, some critics feel that SOA services are still too constrained by applications they represent.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/soa-services-still-too-constrained-by-applications-they-represent/ | title=SOA services still too constrained by applications they represent | date=June 27, 2009 | publisher=zdnet.com | accessdate=June 27, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nA primary challenge faced by service-oriented architecture is managing of metadata. Environments based on SOA include many services which communicate among each other to perform tasks. Due to the fact that the design may involve multiple services working in conjunction, an Application may generate millions of messages. Further services may belong to different organizations or even competing firms creating a huge trust issue. Thus SOA governance comes into the scheme of things.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.opengroup.org/soa/source-book/soa_refarch/governance.htm|title=Governance Layer|website=www.opengroup.org|access-date=2016-09-22}}</ref>\n\nAnother major problem faced by SOA is the lack of a uniform testing framework. There are no tools that provide the required features for testing these services in a service-oriented architecture.

Service-oriented architecture integrates distributed, separately maintained and deployed software components. It is enabled by technologies and standards that facilitate components' communication and cooperation over a network, especially over an IP network.\n\nSOA is related to the idea of an [[application programming interface]] (API), an interface or communication protocol between different parts of a computer program intended to simplify the implementation and maintenance of software.  An API can be thought of as the service, and the SOA the architecture that allows the service to operate.\n\n== Overview ==\nIn SOA, services use protocols that describe how they [[Message passing|pass]] and parse messages using description [[metadata]]. This metadata describes both the functional characteristics of the service and quality-of-service characteristics. Service-oriented architecture aims to allow users to combine large chunks of functionality to form applications which are built purely from existing services and combining them in an ad hoc manner. A service presents a simple interface to the requester that abstracts away the underlying complexity acting as a black box. Further users can also access these independent services without any knowledge of their internal implementation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/library/ws-migratesoa/ |title=Migrating to a service-oriented architecture, Part 1 |date=2008-12-09 |access-date=2016-09-21 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209120916/http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/library/ws-migratesoa/ |archivedate=December 9, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n== Defining concepts ==\nThe related buzzword [[service-orientation]] promotes ''[[loose coupling]]'' between services.

One example is [[SOAP]], which has gained broad industry acceptance after recommendation of Version 1.2 from the W3C<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/2003/06/soap12-pressrelease |title=SOAP Version 1.2 \u306e\u516c\u958b\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066 (W3C \u52e7\u544a) |language=ja |publisher=W3.org |accessdate=August 13, 2012 }}</ref> (World Wide Web Consortium) in 2003. These standards (also referred to as [[List of web service specifications|web service specifications]]) also provide greater interoperability and some protection from lock-in to proprietary vendor software. One can, however, also implement SOA using any other service-based technology, such as [[Jini]], [[CORBA]] or [[Representational State Transfer|REST]].\n\nArchitectures can operate independently of specific technologies and can therefore be implemented using a wide range of technologies, including:\n* [[Web services]] based on WSDL and [[SOAP]]\n* Messaging, e.g., with ActiveMQ, JMS, RabbitMQ\n* RESTful HTTP, with [[Representational state transfer]] (REST) constituting its own constraints-based architectural style\n* [[OPC Unified Architecture|OPC-UA]]\n* [[Windows Communication Foundation|WCF]] (Microsoft's implementation of Web services, forming a part of WCF)\n* [[Apache Thrift]]\n* [[gRPC]]\n* [[SORCER]]\n\nImplementations can use one or more of these protocols and, for example, might use a file-system mechanism to communicate data following a defined interface specification between processes conforming to the SOA concept. The key is independent services with defined interfaces that can be called to perform their tasks in a standard way, without a service having foreknowledge of the calling application, and without the application having or needing knowledge of how the service actually performs its tasks. SOA enables the development of applications that are built by combining loosely coupled and [[interoperable]] services.\n\nThese services inter-operate based on a formal definition (or contract, e.g., WSDL) that is independent of the underlying platform and programming language. The interface definition [[Information hiding|hides the implementation]] of the language-specific service. SOA-based systems can therefore function independently of development technologies and platforms (such as Java, .NET, etc.). Services written in C# running on .NET platforms and services written in Java running on [[Java Platform, Enterprise Edition|Java EE]] platforms, for example, can both be consumed by a common composite application (or client). Applications running on either platform can also consume services running on the other as web services that facilitate reuse. Managed environments can also wrap COBOL legacy systems and present them as software services.<sup>[[Service-oriented architecture#cite note-23|.]]</sup><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fujitsu.com/global/documents/about/resources/publications/fstj/archives/vol42-3/paper18.pdf|title=. \"Case Study of System Architecture that use COBOL assets\"|last=Okishima|first=Haruhiru|date=2006|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n[[High-level programming language]]s such as [[BPEL]] and specifications such as [[WS-CDL]] and [[WS-Coordination]] extend the service concept by providing a method of defining and supporting orchestration of fine-grained services into more coarse-grained business services, which architects can in turn incorporate into workflows and business processes implemented in [[composite applications]] or [[Enterprise portal|portals]].\n\n[[Service-oriented modeling]] is an SOA framework that identifies the various disciplines that guide SOA practitioners to conceptualize, analyze, design, and architect their service-oriented assets. The [[Service-oriented modeling#Service-oriented modeling framework|Service-oriented modeling framework (SOMF)]] offers a modeling language and a work structure or \"map\" depicting the various components that contribute to a successful service-oriented modeling approach. It illustrates the major elements that identify the \"what to do\" aspects of a service development scheme. The model enables practitioners to craft a [[project plan]] and to identify the milestones of a service-oriented initiative. SOMF also provides a common modeling notation to address alignment between business and IT organizations.[[File:SOA Elements.png|thumb|450px|right|Elements of SOA, by Dirk Krafzig, Karl Banke, and Dirk Slama<ref>''Enterprise SOA''. Prentice Hall, 2005</ref>]]\n[[File:SOA Metamodel.svg|thumb|450px|right|SOA meta-model, The Linthicum Group, 2007]]\n\n== Organizational benefits ==\nSome [[enterprise architect]]s believe that SOA can help businesses respond more quickly and more cost-effectively to changing market conditions.<ref>Christopher Koch [http://www.cio.com.au/index.php/id;1350140708 A New Blueprint For The Enterprise], ''CIO Magazine'', March 1, 2005</ref> This style of ''architecture'' promotes reuse at the macro (service) level rather than micro (classes) level. It can also simplify interconnection to\u2014and usage of\u2014existing IT (legacy) assets.\n\nWith SOA, the idea is that an organization can look at a problem holistically. A business has more overall control. Theoretically there would not be a mass of developers using whatever tool sets might please them. But rather they would be coding to a standard that is set within the business. They can also develop enterprise-wide SOA that encapsulates a business-oriented infrastructure. SOA has also been illustrated as a highway system providing efficiency for car drivers. The point being that if everyone had a car, but there was no highway anywhere, things would be limited and disorganized, in any attempt to get anywhere quickly or efficiently. IBM Vice President of Web Services Michael Liebow says that SOA \"builds highways\".<ref>Elizabeth Millard (January 2005). \"Building a Better Process\". ''Computer User''. Page 20.</ref>\n\nIn some respects, SOA could be regarded as an architectural evolution rather than as a revolution. It captures many of the [[best practice]]s of previous software architectures. In communications systems, for example, little development of solutions that use truly static bindings to talk to other equipment in the network has taken place. By embracing a SOA approach, such systems can position themselves to stress the importance of well-defined, highly inter-operable interfaces. Other predecessors of SOA include [[Component-based software engineering]] and Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) of remote objects, for instance, in [[CORBA]].\n\nA service comprises a stand-alone unit of functionality available only via a formally defined interface. Services can be some kind of \"nano-enterprises\" that are easy to produce and improve. Also services can be \"mega-corporations\" constructed as the coordinated work of subordinate services.\n\nReasons for treating the implementation of services as separate projects from larger projects include:\n# Separation promotes the concept to the business that services can be delivered quickly and independently from the larger and slower-moving projects common in the organization. The business starts understanding systems and simplified user interfaces calling on services. This advocates [[agility]]. That is to say, it fosters business innovations and speeds up time-to-market.<ref>Brayan Zimmerli (November 11, 2009) [https://web.archive.org/web/20101105063545/http://www.brayan.com/projects/BenefitsOfSOA/default.htm Business Benefits of SOA], ''University of Applied Science of Northwestern Switzerland, School of Business''</ref>\n# Separation promotes the decoupling of services from consuming projects. This encourages good design insofar as the service is designed without knowing who its consumers are.\n# Documentation and test artifacts of the service are not embedded within the detail of the larger project. This is important when the service needs to be reused later.\n\nSOA promises to simplify testing indirectly. Services are autonomous, stateless, with fully documented interfaces, and separate from the cross-cutting concerns of the implementation. If an organization possesses appropriately defined test data, then a corresponding stub is built that reacts to the test data when a service is being built. A full set of regression tests, scripts, data, and responses is also captured for the service. The service can be tested as a 'black box' using existing stubs corresponding to the services it calls. Test environments can be constructed where the primitive and out-of-scope services are stubs, while the remainder of the mesh is test deployments of full services. As each interface is fully documented with its own full set of regression test documentation, it becomes simple to identify problems in test services. Testing evolves to merely validate that the test service operates according to its documentation, and finds gaps in documentation and test cases of all services within the environment. Managing the data state of [[idempotent]] services is the only complexity.\n\nExamples may prove useful to aid in documenting a service to the level where it becomes useful. The documentation of some APIs within the Java Community Process provide good examples. As these are exhaustive, staff would typically use only important subsets. The 'ossjsa.pdf' file within [[Java Platform, Standard Edition|JSR-89]] exemplifies such a file.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110726070810/https://cds.sun.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/WFS/CDS-CDS_Developer-Site/en_US/-/USD/ViewProductDetail-Start?ProductRef=7854-oss_service_activation-1.0-fr-spec-oth-JSpec%40CDS-CDS_Developer JSR-000089 OSS Service Activation API Specification 1.0 Final Release]. sun.com</ref>\n\n== Criticism ==\nSOA has been conflated with [[Web service]]s;<ref>{{cite web|author=Joe McKendrick|title=Bray: SOA too complex; 'just vendor BS'|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/service-oriented/bray-soa-too-complex-just-vendor-bs/597|publisher=ZDNet}}</ref> however, Web services are only one option to implement the patterns that comprise the SOA style. In the absence of native or binary forms of remote procedure call (RPC), applications could run more slowly and require more processing power, increasing costs. Most implementations do incur these overheads, but SOA can be implemented using technologies (for example, [[Java Business Integration]] (JBI), [[Windows Communication Foundation]] (WCF) and [[data distribution service]] (DDS)) that do not depend on remote procedure calls or translation through XML or JSON. At the same time, emerging open-source XML parsing technologies (such as [[VTD-XML]]) and various XML-compatible binary formats promise to significantly improve SOA performance.<ref>Jimmy Zhang (February 20, 2008) [http://xml.sys-con.com/read/453082.htm \"Index XML Documents with VTD-XML\"].

This constraint has the drawback that it could reduce the overall [[scalability]] of the service provider if the service-provider needs to retain the shared context for each consumer. It also increases the coupling between a service provider and a consumer and makes switching service providers more difficult.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.jpmorgenthal.com/morgenthal/?p=31 | title=The Reason SOA Isn't Delivering Sustainable Software | date=June 19, 2009 | publisher=jpmorgenthal.com | accessdate=June 27, 2009 }}</ref> Ultimately, some critics feel that SOA services are still too constrained by applications they represent.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/soa-services-still-too-constrained-by-applications-they-represent/ | title=SOA services still too constrained by applications they represent | date=June 27, 2009 | publisher=zdnet.com | accessdate=June 27, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nA primary challenge faced by service-oriented architecture is managing of metadata. Environments based on SOA include many services which communicate among each other to perform tasks. Due to the fact that the design may involve multiple services working in conjunction, an Application may generate millions of messages. Further services may belong to different organizations or even competing firms creating a huge trust issue. Thus SOA governance comes into the scheme of things.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.opengroup.org/soa/source-book/soa_refarch/governance.htm|title=Governance Layer|website=www.opengroup.org|access-date=2016-09-22}}</ref>\n\nAnother major problem faced by SOA is the lack of a uniform testing framework. There are no tools that provide the required features for testing these services in a service-oriented architecture.

The notion of complexity-hiding and reuse, but also the concept of loosely coupling services has inspired researchers to elaborate on similarities between the two philosophies, SOA and Web 2.0, and their respective applications. Some argue Web 2.0 and SOA have significantly different elements and thus can not be regarded \"parallel philosophies\", whereas others consider the two concepts as complementary and regard Web 2.0 as the global SOA.<ref name=\"sch\">{{ cite journal | url=http://www.alexandria.unisg.ch/Publikationen/37270| title=Web 2.0 and SOA: Converging Concepts Enabling the Internet of Services | journal=IT Professional | volume=9 | issue=3 | pages=36\u201341 | accessdate=February 23, 2008 |author1=Christoph Schroth  |author2=Till Janner | year=2007 | doi=10.1109/MITP.2007.60 }}</ref>\n\nThe philosophies of Web 2.0 and SOA serve different user needs and thus expose differences with respect to the design and also the technologies used in real-world applications.
