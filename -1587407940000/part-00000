It was his first release through RCA, which would be his label for the next decade. Following the [[hard rock]] sound of ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'', ''Hunky Dory'' marked a move towards [[art rock]] and [[art pop]] styles. Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]] and Bowie himself, it was recorded in mid-1971 at [[Trident Studios]] in London and featured [[Rick Wakeman]] on piano and the musicians who would later be known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]. The album cover, photographed by Brian Ward and airbrushed by Terry Pastor, was influenced by a [[Marlene Dietrich]] photo book that Bowie took with him to the photoshoot.<ref>{{cite book |title=1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die |last=Dimery |first=Robert |year=2005 |publisher=Quintet Publishing |location=London |isbn=978-1-84403-392-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/1001albumsyoumus0000unse_l0q0/page/254 254] |url=https://archive.org/details/1001albumsyoumus0000unse_l0q0/page/254 }}</ref>\n\nThe album was initially released to favourable critical and commercial reception but wasn't a major success until the commercial breakthrough of his following album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' (1972). It was supported by the singles \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\" in 1972 and \"[[Life on Mars (song)|Life on Mars?]]\" in 1973. Retrospectively, ''Hunky Dory'' has received critical acclaim and is regarded as one of Bowie's best works. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' chose it as part of their \"100 best albums of all time\" list in January 2010, with journalist [[Josh Tyrangiel]] praising Bowie's \"earthbound ambition to be a [[Bohemianism|boho]] poet with prodigal style\".<ref name=time /> The album has been reissued multiple times and remastered in 2015 as part of the ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' box set.\n\n== Production ==\nWith new bass player [[Trevor Bolder]] replacing [[Tony Visconti]], ''Hunky Dory'' was the first production featuring all the members of the band that would become known the following year as Ziggy Stardust's [[The Spiders from Mars|Spiders From Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]. Also debuting with Bowie, in Visconti's place as producer, was another key contributor to the Ziggy phase, [[Ken Scott]]. The album's sleeve would bear the credit \"Produced by Ken Scott (assisted by the actor)\". The \"actor\" was Bowie himself, whose \"pet conceit\", in the words of ''[[NME]]'' critics [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]], was \"to think of himself as an actor\".{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=7\u201311}} Keyboardist [[Rick Wakeman]], then of the [[Strawbs]] and a noted [[session musician]], plays the piano on the album.\n\n== Style and themes ==\nAuthor [[Peter Doggett]] describes ''Hunky Dory'' as \"a collective of attractively accessible pop songs, through which Bowie tested out his feelings about the nature of stardom and power.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=11}} Musical biographer David Buckley said of the album: \"Its almost easy-listening status and conventional musical sensibility has detracted from the fact that, lyrically, this record lays down the blueprint for Bowie's future career.\"<ref name=buckstrange1>{{cite book |title=Strange Fascination \u2013 David Bowie: The Definitive Story |last=Buckley |first=David |year=2000 |origyear=1999 |publisher=Virgin Books |location=London |isbn=0-7535-0457-X |page=112}}</ref> The opening track, \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\", focused on the compulsive nature of artistic reinvention (\"Strange fascination, fascinating me/Changes are taking the pace I'm going through\") and distancing oneself from the rock mainstream (\"Look out, you rock 'n' rollers\"). However, the composer also took time to pay tribute to his influences with the tracks \"[[Song for Bob Dylan]]\", \"[[Andy Warhol (David Bowie song)|Andy Warhol]]\" and the [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]] inspired \"[[Queen Bitch]]\".\n\nFollowing the [[hard rock]] of Bowie's previous album ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'', ''Hunky Dory'' saw the partial return of the fey pop singer of ''[[Space Oddity (album)|Space Oddity]]'', with light fare such as \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" (dedicated to his young son, known at the time as [[Duncan Jones|Zowie Bowie]] but legally named Duncan Zowie Haywood Jones) and the cover \"Fill Your Heart\" sitting alongside heavier material like the [[occult]]-tinged \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\" (whose lyric mentions the Golden Dawn (i.e. the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]) and [[Aleister Crowley]]) and the semi-autobiographical \"[[The Bewlay Brothers]]\". Between the two extremes was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\", whose pop tune hid lyrics, inspired by [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], predicting the imminent replacement of modern man by \"the [[\u00dcbermensch|Homo Superior]]\", and which has been cited as a direct precursor to \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\" from Bowie's next album, ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from

It was his first release through RCA, which would be his label for the next decade. Following the [[hard rock]] sound of ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'', ''Hunky Dory'' marked a move towards [[art rock]] and [[art pop]] styles. Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]] and Bowie himself, it was recorded in mid-1971 at [[Trident Studios]] in London and featured [[Rick Wakeman]] on piano and the musicians who would later be known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]. The album cover, photographed by Brian Ward and airbrushed by Terry Pastor, was influenced by a [[Marlene Dietrich]] photo book that Bowie took with him to the photoshoot.<ref>{{cite book |title=1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die |last=Dimery |first=Robert |year=2005 |publisher=Quintet Publishing |location=London |isbn=978-1-84403-392-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/1001albumsyoumus0000unse_l0q0/page/254 254] |url=https://archive.org/details/1001albumsyoumus0000unse_l0q0/page/254 }}</ref>\n\nThe album was initially released to favourable critical and commercial reception but wasn't a major success until the commercial breakthrough of his following album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' (1972). It was supported by the singles \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\" in 1972 and \"[[Life on Mars (song)|Life on Mars?]]\" in 1973. Retrospectively, ''Hunky Dory'' has received critical acclaim and is regarded as one of Bowie's best works. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' chose it as part of their \"100 best albums of all time\" list in January 2010, with journalist [[Josh Tyrangiel]] praising Bowie's \"earthbound ambition to be a [[Bohemianism|boho]] poet with prodigal style\".<ref name=time /> The album has been reissued multiple times and remastered in 2015 as part of the ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' box set.\n\n== Production ==\nWith new bass player [[Trevor Bolder]] replacing [[Tony Visconti]], ''Hunky Dory'' was the first production featuring all the members of the band that would become known the following year as Ziggy Stardust's [[The Spiders from Mars|Spiders From Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]. Also debuting with Bowie, in Visconti's place as producer, was another key contributor to the Ziggy phase, [[Ken Scott]]. The album's sleeve would bear the credit \"Produced by Ken Scott (assisted by the actor)\". The \"actor\" was Bowie himself, whose \"pet conceit\", in the words of ''[[NME]]'' critics [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]], was \"to think of himself as an actor\".{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=7\u201311}} Keyboardist [[Rick Wakeman]], then of the [[Strawbs]] and a noted [[session musician]], plays the piano on the album.\n\n== Style and themes ==\nAuthor [[Peter Doggett]] describes ''Hunky Dory'' as \"a collective of attractively accessible pop songs, through which Bowie tested out his feelings about the nature of stardom and power.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=11}} Musical biographer David Buckley said of the album: \"Its almost easy-listening status and conventional musical sensibility has detracted from the fact that, lyrically, this record lays down the blueprint for Bowie's future career.\"<ref name=buckstrange1>{{cite book |title=Strange Fascination \u2013 David Bowie: The Definitive Story |last=Buckley |first=David |year=2000 |origyear=1999 |publisher=Virgin Books |location=London |isbn=0-7535-0457-X |page=112}}</ref> The opening track, \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\", focused on the compulsive nature of artistic reinvention (\"Strange fascination, fascinating me/Changes are taking the pace I'm going through\") and distancing oneself from the rock mainstream (\"Look out, you rock 'n' rollers\"). However, the composer also took time to pay tribute to his influences with the tracks \"[[Song for Bob Dylan]]\", \"[[Andy Warhol (David Bowie song)|Andy Warhol]]\" and the [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]] inspired \"[[Queen Bitch]]\".\n\nFollowing the [[hard rock]] of Bowie's previous album ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'', ''Hunky Dory'' saw the partial return of the fey pop singer of ''[[Space Oddity (album)|Space Oddity]]'', with light fare such as \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" (dedicated to his young son, known at the time as [[Duncan Jones|Zowie Bowie]] but legally named Duncan Zowie Haywood Jones) and the cover \"Fill Your Heart\" sitting alongside heavier material like the [[occult]]-tinged \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\" (whose lyric mentions the Golden Dawn (i.e. the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]) and [[Aleister Crowley]]) and the semi-autobiographical \"[[The Bewlay Brothers]]\". Between the two extremes was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\", whose pop tune hid lyrics, inspired by [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], predicting the imminent replacement of modern man by \"the [[\u00dcbermensch|Homo Superior]]\", and which has been cited as a direct precursor to \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\" from Bowie's next album, ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from
