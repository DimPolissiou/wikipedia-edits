Rising artists Valens, Richardson, and [[Dion and the Belmonts]] had joined the tour as well. The long journeys between venues on board the cold, uncomfortable tour buses adversely affected the performers, with cases of [[influenza|flu]] and even [[frostbite]]. After stopping at Clear Lake to perform, and frustrated by such conditions, Holly chose to charter a plane to reach their next venue in [[Moorhead, Minnesota]]. Richardson, suffering from flu, swapped places with Jennings, taking his seat on the plane, while Allsup lost his seat to Valens on a [[coin toss]].\n\nSoon after takeoff, late at night and in poor, wintry weather conditions, the pilot lost control of the light aircraft, a [[Beechcraft Bonanza]], which subsequently crashed into a cornfield. All four on board were killed, and the event has since been mentioned in various songs and films. A number of monuments have been erected at the crash site and in Clear Lake, where an annual memorial concert is also held at the [[Surf Ballroom]], the venue that hosted the artists' last performance.\n\n==Background==\n[[Buddy Holly]] terminated his association with [[the Crickets]] in November 1958. For the start of the \"Winter Dance Party\" [[concert tour|tour]], he assembled a band consisting of [[Waylon Jennings]] (bass), [[Tommy Allsup]] (guitar), and [[Carl Bunch]] (drums), with the opening vocals of [[Frankie Sardo]]. The tour was set to cover 24 [[Midwest]]ern cities in as many days. New hit artist [[Ritchie Valens]], [[The Big Bopper|\"The Big Bopper\" J. P. Richardson]], and [[Dion DiMucci]] (and his band [[Dion and the Belmonts|The Belmonts]]) joined the tour to promote their recordings and make an extra profit.<ref name=\"Suddath\"/>{{sfn|Everitt|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=H4TSH_b7IHYC&pg=PA10 10]}}\n\n[[File:Winter Dance Party Tour Schedule, 1959.svg|thumb|<!--left|-->Winter Dance Party Tour schedule, 1959]]\nThe 1959 tour began in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], on January&nbsp;23 and the performance at Clear Lake on February&nbsp;2 was the eleventh of 24 scheduled locations. The amount of travel soon became a logistical problem. The distances between venues had not been properly considered when the performances were scheduled; instead of \"circling\" around the Midwest to each town, the tour erratically zig-zagged across the region, with distances between cities over {{convert|400|mi}}. [[General Artists Corporation]], the organization that booked the tour, later received considerable criticism for their seemingly total disregard for the conditions they forced the touring musicians to endure:\n\n{{quote|They didn't care. It was like they threw darts at a map ... The tour from hell \u2013 that's what they named it \u2013 and it's not a bad name.|''Buddy Holly historian Bill Griggs''<ref name=\"startribune.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.startribune.com/2009-buddy-holly-the-tour-from-hell/38282249/ |title=Buddy Holly: The tour from hell |website=Star Tribune}}</ref>}}\n\nThe entire company of musicians traveled together in one bus, although the buses used for the tour were wholly inadequate, breaking down and being replaced frequently. Griggs estimates that five separate buses were used in the first eleven days of the tour \u2013 \"reconditioned school buses, not good enough for school kids.\"<ref name=\"startribune.com\"/> The artists themselves were responsible for loading and unloading equipment at each stop, as no road crew assisted them. Adding to the disarray, the buses were not equipped for the weather, which consisted of waist-deep snow in several areas and varying temperatures from {{cvt|20|F}} to as low as {{cvt|\u221236|F}}. One bus had a heating system that broke down shortly after the tour began, in [[Appleton, Wisconsin]].\n\nLater, Richardson and Valens began experiencing [[influenza|flu]]-like symptoms and drummer Bunch was hospitalized for severely [[frostbitten]] feet, after the tour bus broke down in the middle of the highway in subzero temperatures near [[Ironwood, Michigan]]. The musicians replaced that bus with another school bus, and kept traveling.{{sfn|Everitt|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=H4TSH_b7IHYC&pg=PA13 13]}} After Bunch was hospitalized, Carlo Mastrangelo of The Belmonts took over the drumming duties. When Dion and The Belmonts were performing, the drum seat was taken by either Valens or Holly. As Holly's group had been the backing band for all of the acts, Holly, Valens, and DiMucci took turns playing drums for each other at the performances in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]], and [[Clear Lake, Iowa]].<ref name=\"WeGoNews\">{{cite web |url=http://www.robertlemon.name/myhurley//links.htm |title=Connection to Buddy Holly Death |publisher=WeGoNews.com |accessdate=February 3, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn Monday, February 2, the tour arrived in Clear Lake, west of [[Mason City, Iowa|Mason City]], having driven {{convert|350|mi}} from the previous day's concert in Green Bay. The town in northern Iowa had not been a scheduled stop; tour promoters hoped to fill the open date and called the manager of the local [[Surf Ballroom]], Carroll Anderson (1920\u20132006), and offered him the show. He accepted, and they set the show for that night. By the time Holly arrived at the venue that evening, he was frustrated with the ongoing problems with the bus. The next scheduled destination after Clear Lake was [[Moorhead, Minnesota]], a {{convert|365|mi|-1|adj=on}} drive north-northwest (and, reflecting the poor planning, a journey that would take them directly back through two towns they had already played within the last week.) No let up after that was in sight, as the following day, they were scheduled to travel back almost directly south to [[Sioux City, Iowa]], a {{convert|325|mi|-1|adj=on}} trip.\n\nHolly chartered a plane to fly himself and his band to [[Fargo, North Dakota]], which is adjacent to Moorhead. The rest of the party would have picked him up in Moorhead, saving him the journey in the bus and leaving him time to get some rest.{{sfn|Everitt|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=H4TSH_b7IHYC&pg=PA13 13]}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Flight arrangements==\n[[File:Beech 35 N3188V Jan1949 (11124699236).jpg|thumb|alt=refer to caption|A V-tailed [[Beechcraft Bonanza|Bonanza]] similar to N3794N, the accident aircraft]]\nAnderson called Hubert Jerry Dwyer (1930\u20132016), owner of the Dwyer Flying Service in Mason City, to charter the plane to fly to Fargo's [[Hector International Airport|Hector Airport]], the closest one to Moorhead.{{sfn|Everitt|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=H4TSH_b7IHYC&pg=PA14 14]}} Flight arrangements were made with Roger Peterson, a 21-year-old local pilot described as a \"young married man who built his life around flying.\"<ref name=\"CAB1\"/>\n\nThe flying service charged a fee of $36 per passenger for the flight on the 1947 single-engined, V-tailed [[Beechcraft 35 Bonanza]] ([[Aircraft registration#United States|registration]] {{Airreg|N|3794N}}), which seated three passengers plus the pilot.{{sfn|Schuck, Raymond|p=16|2012}} A&nbsp;popular misconception, originating from [[Don McLean]]'s eponymous [[American Pie (song)|song about the crash]], was that the plane was called ''American Pie'';<!-- In fact,--> no record exists of any name ever having been given to N3794N.<ref>{{cite web |title=American Pie |url=http://www.snopes.com/music/artists/americanpie.asp |website=Snopes.com |accessdate=April 16, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe most widely accepted version of events was that Richardson had contracted flu during the tour and asked Jennings for his seat on the plane. When Holly learned that Jennings was not going to fly, he said in jest: \"Well, I hope your ol' bus freezes up.\" Jennings responded: \"Well, I hope your ol' plane crashes,\" a humorous but ill-fated response that haunted him for the rest of his life.{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p=70}} Valens, who once had a [[fear of flying]], asked Allsup for his seat on the plane. The two agreed to [[coin toss|toss a coin]] to decide.{{sfn|Everitt|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=H4TSH_b7IHYC&pg=PA14 14]}} Bob Hale, a [[disc jockey]] with Mason City's [[KRIB|KRIB-AM]], was working the concert that night and flipped the coin in the ballroom's side-stage room shortly before the musicians departed for the airport. Valens won the coin toss for the seat on the flight.\n\nIn contradiction to the testimony of Allsup and Jennings, Dion has since said that Holly approached him along with Valens and Richardson to join the flight, not Holly's bandmates. In a 2009 interview, Dion said that Holly called him, Valens, and Richardson into a vacant dressing room during Sardo's performance and said \"I've chartered a plane, we're the guys making the money [we should be the ones flying ahead]...the only problem is there are only two available seats.\" According to Dion, it was Valens, not Richardson, who had fallen ill, so Valens and Dion flipped a coin for the seat. In his interview, no mention is made of Jennings or Allsup being invited on the plane. Dion said he won the toss, but ultimately decided that since the $36 fare ({{Inflation|US|36|1959|r=-1|fmt=eq}}{{inflation-fn|US}}) equaled the monthly rent his parents paid for his childhood apartment, he could not justify the indulgence.<ref>{{cite book |last=DiMucci |first=Dion |title=The Wanderer |page=89 |publisher=Beech Tree Books |year=1988}}</ref>\n\n==Take-off and crash==\nAfter the show ended, Anderson drove Holly, Valens, and Richardson to nearby [[Mason City Municipal Airport]],{{sfn|Everitt|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=H4TSH_b7IHYC&pg=PA15 15]}} whose [[elevation]] is {{convert|1214|ft}} [[Sea level#AMSL|AMSL]].

It emerged that Peterson had over four years of flying experience, of which one was with Dwyer Flying Service, and had accumulated 711 flying hours, of which 128 were on Bonanzas. He had also logged 52 hours of [[Instrument flight rules|instrument flight training]], although he had passed only his written examination, and was not yet qualified to operate in weather that required flying solely by reference to instruments. He and Dwyer Flying Service itself were certified to operate only under [[visual flight rules]], which essentially require that the pilot must be able to see where he is going. However, on the night of the accident, visual flight would have been virtually impossible due to the low clouds, the lack of a visible horizon, and the absence of ground lights over the sparsely populated area.<ref name=\"CAB1\"/> Furthermore, Peterson, who had failed an instrument [[FAA Practical Test|checkride]] nine months before the accident, had received his instrument training on airplanes equipped with a conventional [[artificial horizon]] as a source of aircraft attitude information, while N3794N was equipped with an older-type Sperry F3 attitude [[gyroscope]]. Crucially, the two types of instruments display the same [[Flight dynamics (fixed-wing aircraft)|aircraft pitch attitude]] information in graphically opposite ways.<ref name=\"CAB1\"/> Another contributing factor was the \"seriously inadequate\" weather briefing provided to Peterson, which \"failed to even mention adverse flying conditions which should have been highlighted.\"<ref name=\"CAB1\"/> \nThe CAB concluded that the probable cause of the accident was \"the pilot's unwise decision\" to attempt a flight that required skills he did not have.<ref name=\"CAB1\"/>\n\n==Subsequent investigations==\nOn March 6, 2007, in [[Beaumont, Texas|Beaumont]], Texas, Richardson's body was [[exhumation|exhumed]] for reburial. This was due to the State of Texas Historical Sign being awarded to the Big Bopper, and a bronze statue would subsequently be erected at his grave. Forest Lawn cemetery did not allow above-ground monuments at that specific site, and his body was moved at the cemetery's expense to another area that would be better suited. As the body was to be placed in a new casket while above ground, the musician's son, Jay Perry Richardson, took the opportunity to have his father's body re-examined to verify the original coroner's findings, and asked forensic anthropologist [[William M. Bass]] to carry out the procedure. A longstanding rumor surrounding the accident, which this re-examination sought to confirm or dispel, asserted that an accidental firearm discharge took place on board the aircraft and caused the crash. Another longstanding theory surmised that Richardson initially survived the crash and subsequently crawled out of the wreckage in search of help before succumbing to his injuries, prompted by the fact that his body was found farther from the plane than the other victims. Bass and his team took several X-rays of Richardson's body and eventually concluded that the musician had indeed died instantly from extensive, unsurvivable fractures to virtually every bone in his body. No traces of lead were found from any bullet, nor any indication that he had been shot. Coroner Smiley's original 1959 report was, therefore, confirmed as accurate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockin50s.com/exhumation.htm |first=Bill |last=Griggs |title=Big Bopper Exhumation |accessdate=April 26, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Autopsy of 'Big Bopper' to Address Rumors About 1959 Plane Crash |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/17/AR2007011701976.html |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=January 18, 2007 |accessdate=April 26, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2015, the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) received a request to reopen the investigation into the accident.<ref name=KITV28252437>{{cite web |url=http://www.ktiv.com/story/28252437/2015/03/03/board-considering-reopening-plane-crash-investigation |title=Board considers reopening investigation into plane crash that caused the death of Buddy Holly |publisher=KITV |date=March 3, 2015 |accessdate=March 4, 2015}}</ref> The request was made by L.

Rising artists Valens, Richardson, and [[Dion and the Belmonts]] had joined the tour as well. The long journeys between venues on board the cold, uncomfortable tour buses adversely affected the performers, with cases of [[influenza|flu]] and even [[frostbite]]. After stopping at Clear Lake to perform, and frustrated by such conditions, Holly chose to charter a plane to reach their next venue in [[Moorhead, Minnesota]]. Richardson, suffering from flu, swapped places with Jennings, taking his seat on the plane, while Allsup lost his seat to Valens on a [[coin toss]].\n\nSoon after takeoff, late at night and in poor, wintry weather conditions, the pilot lost control of the light aircraft, a [[Beechcraft Bonanza]], which subsequently crashed into a cornfield. All four on board were killed, and the event has since been mentioned in various songs and films. A number of monuments have been erected at the crash site and in Clear Lake, where an annual memorial concert is also held at the [[Surf Ballroom]], the venue that hosted the artists' last performance.\n\n==Background==\n[[Buddy Holly]] terminated his association with [[the Crickets]] in November 1958. For the start of the \"Winter Dance Party\" [[concert tour|tour]], he assembled a band consisting of [[Waylon Jennings]] (bass), [[Tommy Allsup]] (guitar), and [[Carl Bunch]] (drums), with the opening vocals of [[Frankie Sardo]]. The tour was set to cover 24 [[Midwest]]ern cities in as many days. New hit artist [[Ritchie Valens]], [[The Big Bopper|\"The Big Bopper\" J. P. Richardson]], and [[Dion DiMucci]] (and his band [[Dion and the Belmonts|The Belmonts]]) joined the tour to promote their recordings and make an extra profit.<ref name=\"Suddath\"/>{{sfn|Everitt|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=H4TSH_b7IHYC&pg=PA10 10]}}\n\n[[File:Winter Dance Party Tour Schedule, 1959.svg|thumb|<!--left|-->Winter Dance Party Tour schedule, 1959]]\nThe 1959 tour began in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], on January&nbsp;23 and the performance at Clear Lake on February&nbsp;2 was the eleventh of 24 scheduled locations. The amount of travel soon became a logistical problem. The distances between venues had not been properly considered when the performances were scheduled; instead of \"circling\" around the Midwest to each town, the tour erratically zig-zagged across the region, with distances between cities over {{convert|400|mi}}. [[General Artists Corporation]], the organization that booked the tour, later received considerable criticism for their seemingly total disregard for the conditions they forced the touring musicians to endure:\n\n{{quote|They didn't care. It was like they threw darts at a map ... The tour from hell \u2013 that's what they named it \u2013 and it's not a bad name.|''Buddy Holly historian Bill Griggs''<ref name=\"startribune.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.startribune.com/2009-buddy-holly-the-tour-from-hell/38282249/ |title=Buddy Holly: The tour from hell |website=Star Tribune}}</ref>}}\n\nThe entire company of musicians traveled together in one bus, although the buses used for the tour were wholly inadequate, breaking down and being replaced frequently. Griggs estimates that five separate buses were used in the first eleven days of the tour \u2013 \"reconditioned school buses, not good enough for school kids.\"<ref name=\"startribune.com\"/> The artists themselves were responsible for loading and unloading equipment at each stop, as no road crew assisted them. Adding to the disarray, the buses were not equipped for the weather, which consisted of waist-deep snow in several areas and varying temperatures from {{cvt|20|F}} to as low as {{cvt|\u221236|F}}. One bus had a heating system that broke down shortly after the tour began, in [[Appleton, Wisconsin]].\n\nLater, Richardson and Valens began experiencing [[influenza|flu]]-like symptoms and drummer Bunch was hospitalized for severely [[frostbitten]] feet, after the tour bus broke down in the middle of the highway in subzero temperatures near [[Ironwood, Michigan]]. The musicians replaced that bus with another school bus, and kept traveling.{{sfn|Everitt|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=H4TSH_b7IHYC&pg=PA13 13]}} After Bunch was hospitalized, Carlo Mastrangelo of The Belmonts took over the drumming duties. When Dion and The Belmonts were performing, the drum seat was taken by either Valens or Holly. As Holly's group had been the backing band for all of the acts, Holly, Valens, and DiMucci took turns playing drums for each other at the performances in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]], and [[Clear Lake, Iowa]].<ref name=\"WeGoNews\">{{cite web |url=http://www.robertlemon.name/myhurley//links.htm |title=Connection to Buddy Holly Death |publisher=WeGoNews.com |accessdate=February 3, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn Monday, February 2, the tour arrived in Clear Lake, west of [[Mason City, Iowa|Mason City]], having driven {{convert|350|mi}} from the previous day's concert in Green Bay. The town in northern Iowa had not been a scheduled stop; tour promoters hoped to fill the open date and called the manager of the local [[Surf Ballroom]], Carroll Anderson (1920\u20132006), and offered him the show. He accepted, and they set the show for that night. By the time Holly arrived at the venue that evening, he was frustrated with the ongoing problems with the bus. The next scheduled destination after Clear Lake was [[Moorhead, Minnesota]], a {{convert|365|mi|-1|adj=on}} drive north-northwest (and, reflecting the poor planning, a journey that would take them directly back through two towns they had already played within the last week.) No let up after that was in sight, as the following day, they were scheduled to travel back almost directly south to [[Sioux City, Iowa]], a {{convert|325|mi|-1|adj=on}} trip.\n\nHolly chartered a plane to fly himself and his band to [[Fargo, North Dakota]], which is adjacent to Moorhead. The rest of the party would have picked him up in Moorhead, saving him the journey in the bus and leaving him time to get some rest.{{sfn|Everitt|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=H4TSH_b7IHYC&pg=PA13 13]}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Flight arrangements==\n[[File:Beech 35 N3188V Jan1949 (11124699236).jpg|thumb|alt=refer to caption|A V-tailed [[Beechcraft Bonanza|Bonanza]] similar to N3794N, the accident aircraft]]\nAnderson called Hubert Jerry Dwyer (1930\u20132016), owner of the Dwyer Flying Service in Mason City, to charter the plane to fly to Fargo's [[Hector International Airport|Hector Airport]], the closest one to Moorhead.{{sfn|Everitt|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=H4TSH_b7IHYC&pg=PA14 14]}} Flight arrangements were made with Roger Peterson, a 21-year-old local pilot described as a \"young married man who built his life around flying.\"<ref name=\"CAB1\"/>\n\nThe flying service charged a fee of $36 per passenger for the flight on the 1947 single-engined, V-tailed [[Beechcraft 35 Bonanza]] ([[Aircraft registration#United States|registration]] {{Airreg|N|3794N}}), which seated three passengers plus the pilot.{{sfn|Schuck, Raymond|p=16|2012}} A&nbsp;popular misconception, originating from [[Don McLean]]'s eponymous [[American Pie (song)|song about the crash]], was that the plane was called ''American Pie'';<!-- In fact,--> no record exists of any name ever having been given to N3794N.<ref>{{cite web |title=American Pie |url=http://www.snopes.com/music/artists/americanpie.asp |website=Snopes.com |accessdate=April 16, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe most widely accepted version of events was that Richardson had contracted flu during the tour and asked Jennings for his seat on the plane. When Holly learned that Jennings was not going to fly, he said in jest: \"Well, I hope your ol' bus freezes up.\" Jennings responded: \"Well, I hope your ol' plane crashes,\" a humorous but ill-fated response that haunted him for the rest of his life.{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p=70}} Valens, who once had a [[fear of flying]], asked Allsup for his seat on the plane. The two agreed to [[coin toss|toss a coin]] to decide.{{sfn|Everitt|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=H4TSH_b7IHYC&pg=PA14 14]}} Bob Hale, a [[disc jockey]] with Mason City's [[KRIB|KRIB-AM]], was working the concert that night and flipped the coin in the ballroom's side-stage room shortly before the musicians departed for the airport. Valens won the coin toss for the seat on the flight.\n\nIn contradiction to the testimony of Allsup and Jennings, Dion has since said that Holly approached him along with Valens and Richardson to join the flight, not Holly's bandmates. In a 2009 interview, Dion said that Holly called him, Valens, and Richardson into a vacant dressing room during Sardo's performance and said \"I've chartered a plane, we're the guys making the money [we should be the ones flying ahead]...the only problem is there are only two available seats.\" According to Dion, it was Valens, not Richardson, who had fallen ill, so Valens and Dion flipped a coin for the seat. In his interview, no mention is made of Jennings or Allsup being invited on the plane. Dion said he won the toss, but ultimately decided that since the $36 fare ({{Inflation|US|36|1959|r=-1|fmt=eq}}{{inflation-fn|US}}) equaled the monthly rent his parents paid for his childhood apartment, he could not justify the indulgence.<ref>{{cite book |last=DiMucci |first=Dion |title=The Wanderer |page=89 |publisher=Beech Tree Books |year=1988}}</ref>\n\n==Take-off and crash==\nAfter the show ended, Anderson drove Holly, Valens, and Richardson to nearby [[Mason City Municipal Airport]],{{sfn|Everitt|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=H4TSH_b7IHYC&pg=PA15 15]}} whose [[elevation]] is {{convert|1214|ft}} [[Sea level#AMSL|AMSL]].

It emerged that Peterson had over four years of flying experience, of which one was with Dwyer Flying Service, and had accumulated 711 flying hours, of which 128 were on Bonanzas. He had also logged 52 hours of [[Instrument flight rules|instrument flight training]], although he had passed only his written examination, and was not yet qualified to operate in weather that required flying solely by reference to instruments. He and Dwyer Flying Service itself were certified to operate only under [[visual flight rules]], which essentially require that the pilot must be able to see where he is going. However, on the night of the accident, visual flight would have been virtually impossible due to the low clouds, the lack of a visible horizon, and the absence of ground lights over the sparsely populated area.<ref name=\"CAB1\"/> Furthermore, Peterson, who had failed an instrument [[FAA Practical Test|checkride]] nine months before the accident, had received his instrument training on airplanes equipped with a conventional [[artificial horizon]] as a source of aircraft attitude information, while N3794N was equipped with an older-type Sperry F3 attitude [[gyroscope]]. Crucially, the two types of instruments display the same [[Flight dynamics (fixed-wing aircraft)|aircraft pitch attitude]] information in graphically opposite ways.<ref name=\"CAB1\"/> Another contributing factor was the \"seriously inadequate\" weather briefing provided to Peterson, which \"failed to even mention adverse flying conditions which should have been highlighted.\"<ref name=\"CAB1\"/> \nThe CAB concluded that the probable cause of the accident was \"the pilot's unwise decision\" to attempt a flight that required skills he did not have.<ref name=\"CAB1\"/>\n\n==Subsequent investigations==\nOn March 6, 2007, in [[Beaumont, Texas|Beaumont]], Texas, Richardson's body was [[exhumation|exhumed]] for reburial. This was due to the State of Texas Historical Sign being awarded to the Big Bopper, and a bronze statue would subsequently be erected at his grave. Forest Lawn cemetery did not allow above-ground monuments at that specific site, and his body was moved at the cemetery's expense to another area that would be better suited. As the body was to be placed in a new casket while above ground, the musician's son, Jay Perry Richardson, took the opportunity to have his father's body re-examined to verify the original coroner's findings, and asked forensic anthropologist [[William M. Bass]] to carry out the procedure. A longstanding rumor surrounding the accident, which this re-examination sought to confirm or dispel, asserted that an accidental firearm discharge took place on board the aircraft and caused the crash. Another longstanding theory surmised that Richardson initially survived the crash and subsequently crawled out of the wreckage in search of help before succumbing to his injuries, prompted by the fact that his body was found farther from the plane than the other victims. Bass and his team took several X-rays of Richardson's body and eventually concluded that the musician had indeed died instantly from extensive, unsurvivable fractures to virtually every bone in his body. No traces of lead were found from any bullet, nor any indication that he had been shot. Coroner Smiley's original 1959 report was, therefore, confirmed as accurate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockin50s.com/exhumation.htm |first=Bill |last=Griggs |title=Big Bopper Exhumation |accessdate=April 26, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Autopsy of 'Big Bopper' to Address Rumors About 1959 Plane Crash |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/17/AR2007011701976.html |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=January 18, 2007 |accessdate=April 26, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2015, the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) received a request to reopen the investigation into the accident.<ref name=KITV28252437>{{cite web |url=http://www.ktiv.com/story/28252437/2015/03/03/board-considering-reopening-plane-crash-investigation |title=Board considers reopening investigation into plane crash that caused the death of Buddy Holly |publisher=KITV |date=March 3, 2015 |accessdate=March 4, 2015}}</ref> The request was made by L.

Recently, frameworks allow the development of native apps for all platforms using languages other than each standard native language. \n* Hybrid apps embed a mobile web site inside a native app, possibly using a hybrid framework.  This allows development using web technologies (and possibly directly copying code from an existing mobile web site) while also retaining certain advantages of native apps (e.g. direct access to device hardware, offline operation, app store visibility).\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2018}}\nIn earlier computing models like client\u2013server, the processing load for the application was shared between code on the server and code installed on each client locally.  In other words, an application had its own pre-compiled client program which served as its [[user interface]] and had to be separately installed on each user's [[personal computer]]. An upgrade to the server-side code of the application would typically also require an upgrade to the client-side code installed on each user workstation, adding to the [[technical support|support]] cost and decreasing [[productivity]].  In addition, both the client and server components of the application were usually tightly bound to a particular [[computer architecture]] and [[operating system]] and [[porting]] them to others was often prohibitively expensive for all but the largest applications.  (Nowadays, [[native app]]s for mobile devices are also hobbled by some or all of the foregoing issues.)\n\nIn contrast, web applications use [[web document]]s written in a standard format such as [[HTML]] and [[JavaScript]], which are supported by a variety of web browsers. Web applications can be considered as a specific variant of client\u2013server software where the client software is downloaded to the client machine when visiting the relevant web page, using standard procedures such as [[HTTP]]. Client web software updates may happen each time the web page is visited. During the session, the web browser interprets and displays the pages, and acts as the ''universal'' client for any web application.\n\nIn the early days of the [[World Wide Web|Web]], each individual web page was delivered to the client as a static document, but the sequence of pages could still provide an interactive experience, as user input was returned through web [[Form (web)|form]] elements embedded in the page markup. However, ''every'' significant change to the web page required a round trip back to the server to refresh the entire page.\n\nIn 1995, [[Netscape]] introduced a [[client-side scripting]] language called [[JavaScript]] allowing programmers to add some [[Dynamic HTML|dynamic elements]] to the user interface that ran on the client side. So instead of sending data to the server in order to generate an entire web page, the embedded scripts of the downloaded page can perform various tasks such as input validation or showing/hiding parts of the page.\n\nIn 1996, Macromedia introduced [[Adobe Flash|Flash]], a [[vector graphics|vector animation]] player that could be added to browsers as a [[plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] to embed animations on the web pages. It allowed the use of a scripting language to program interactions on the client side with no need to communicate with the server.\n\nIn 1999, the \"web application\" concept was introduced in the Java language in the Servlet Specification version 2.2. [2.1?].<ref name=\"jgurufaq\">{{cite web | url = http://www.jguru.com/faq/view.jsp?EID=129328 | title = What is a web application (or \"webapp\")? | author = Alex Chaffee | date = 2000-08-17 | accessdate = 2008-07-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | url = http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/download.html | title = Java Servlet Specification (\"Specification\") Version: 2.2 Final Release | author = James Duncan Davidson, Danny Coward | publisher = [[Sun Microsystems]] | pages = 43\u201346 | date = 1999-12-17 | accessdate = 2008-07-27}}</ref> At that time both JavaScript and [[XML]] had already been developed, but [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] had still not yet been coined and the [[XMLHttpRequest]] object had only been recently introduced on Internet Explorer 5 as an ActiveX object.<ref name=\"apple\">{{cite web |url = https://developer.apple.com/internet/webcontent/xmlhttpreq.html | title = Dynamic HTML and XML: The XMLHttpRequest Object | publisher = Apple Inc | accessdate = 2008-06-25}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, the term Ajax was coined, and applications like [[Gmail]] started to make their client sides more and more interactive. A web page script is able to contact the server for storing/retrieving data without downloading an entire web page.\n\nIn 2011, [[HTML5]] was finalized, which provides graphic and multimedia capabilities without the need of client side plug-ins. HTML5 also enriched the semantic content of documents. The APIs and [[document object model]] (DOM) are no longer afterthoughts, but are fundamental parts of the HTML5 specification. [[WebGL]] API paved the way for advanced 3D graphics based on HTML5 canvas and JavaScript language. These have significant importance in creating truly platform and browser independent [[Rich Internet application|rich web applications]].\n\n==Interface==\nThrough [[Java (Sun)|Java]], [[JavaScript]], [[DHTML]], [[Adobe Flash|Flash]], [[Microsoft Silverlight|Silverlight]] and other technologies, application-specific methods such as drawing on the screen, playing audio, and access to the keyboard and mouse are all possible. Many services have worked to combine all of these into a more familiar interface that adopts the appearance of an operating system. General purpose techniques such as [[drag and drop]] are also supported by these technologies. Web developers often use client-side scripting to add functionality, especially to create an interactive experience that does not require page reloading. Recently, technologies have been developed to coordinate client-side scripting with server-side technologies such as [[ASP.NET]], [[J2ee|J2EE]], [[Plack (software)|Perl/Plack]] and [[PHP]].\n\n[[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]], a web development technique using a combination of various technologies, is an example of technology which creates a more interactive experience.\n\n==Structure==\nApplications are usually broken into logical chunks called \"tiers\", where every tier is assigned a role.<ref name=\"ntiered\" /> Traditional applications consist only of 1 tier, which resides on the client machine, but web applications lend themselves to an n-tiered approach by nature.<ref name=\"ntiered\" /> Though many variations are possible, the most common structure is the [[Three-tier (computing)|three-tiered]] application.<ref name=\"ntiered\" /> In its most common form, the three tiers are called ''presentation'', ''application'' and ''storage'', in this order. A web browser is the first tier (presentation), an engine using some dynamic Web content technology (such as [[Active Server Pages|ASP]], [[Common Gateway Interface|CGI]], [[ColdFusion]], [[Dart (programming language)|Dart]], [[Java Servlet|JSP/Java]], [[Node.js]], [[PHP]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]] or [[Ruby on Rails]]) is the middle tier (application logic), and a database is the third tier (storage).<ref name=\"ntiered\" /> The web browser sends requests to the middle tier, which services them by making queries and updates against the database and generates a user interface. \n\nFor more complex applications, a 3-tier solution may fall short, and it may be beneficial to use an n-tiered approach, where the greatest benefit is breaking the business logic, which resides on the application tier, into a more fine-grained model.<ref name=\"ntiered\" /> Another benefit may be adding an integration tier that separates the data tier from the rest of tiers by providing an easy-to-use interface to access the data.<ref name=\"ntiered\" /> For example, the client data would be accessed by calling a \"list_clients()\" function instead of making an SQL query directly against the client table on the database. This allows the underlying database to be replaced without making any change to the other tiers.<ref name=\"ntiered\" />\n\nThere are some who view a web application as a two-tier architecture. This can be a \"smart\" client that performs all the work and queries a \"dumb\" server, or a \"dumb\" client that relies on a \"smart\" server.<ref name=\"ntiered\" /> The client would handle the presentation tier, the server would have the database (storage tier), and the business logic (application tier) would be on one of them or on both.<ref name=\"ntiered\" /> While this increases the scalability of the applications and separates the display and the database, it still doesn't allow for true specialization of layers, so most applications will outgrow this model.<ref name=\"ntiered\">{{cite web|url=http://krunal-ajax-javascript.blogspot.bg/2008/09/benefits-of-using-n-tiered-approach-for.html|title=Benefits of using the n-tiered approach for web applications|author=Jeremy Petersen|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Business use==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2018}}\n\nAn emerging strategy for application software companies is to provide web access to software previously distributed as local applications.  Depending on the type of application, it may require the development of an entirely different browser-based interface, or merely adapting an existing application to use different presentation technology. These programs allow the user to pay a monthly or yearly fee for use of a software application without having to install it on a local hard drive. A company which follows this strategy is known as an [[application service provider]] (ASP), and ASPs are currently receiving much attention in the software industry.\n\nSecurity breaches on these kinds of applications are a major concern because it can involve both enterprise information and private customer data. Protecting these assets is an important part of any web application and there \nare some key operational areas that must be included in the development process.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://content.dell.com/us/en/enterprise/d/large-business/secure-app-development.aspx|title= Top Tips for Secure App Development|publisher=Dell.com | accessdate=2012-06-22}}</ref> This includes processes for authentication, authorization, asset handling, input, and logging and auditing. Building security into the applications from the beginning can be more effective and less disruptive in the long run.\n\n[[Cloud computing]] model web applications are [[software as a service]] (SaaS). There are business applications provided as SaaS for enterprises for a fixed or usage-dependent fee. Other web applications are offered free of charge, often generating income from advertisements shown in web application interface.\n\n==Development==\n{{Main|Web application development}}\nWriting web applications is often simplified by the use of [[web application framework]]. These frameworks facilitate [[rapid application development]] by allowing a development team to focus on the parts of their application which are unique to their goals without having to resolve common development issues such as user management.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://docforge.com/wiki/Web_application_framework | title=Web application framework | author=Multiple (wiki) | work=Docforge | accessdate=2010-03-06 }}</ref> Many of the frameworks in use are [[open-source software]].\n\nThe use of web application frameworks can often reduce the number of errors in a program, both by making the code simpler, and by allowing one team to concentrate on the framework while another focuses on a specified use case.  In applications which are exposed to constant [[Hacker (computer security)|hacking]] attempts on the Internet, [[Software Development Security|security-related]] problems can be caused by errors in the program. Frameworks can also promote the use of best practices<ref>{{cite web | url=http://docforge.com/wiki/Framework | title=Framework | author=Multiple (wiki) | work=Docforge | accessdate=2010-03-06 }}</ref> such as [[Post/Redirect/Get|GET after POST]].\n\nIn addition, there is potential for the development of applications on [[Internet operating system]]s, although currently there are not many viable platforms that fit this model.\n\n==Applications==\nExamples of browser applications are simple office software ([[word processor]]s, [[List of online spreadsheets|online spreadsheets]], see how to convert excel to a web app<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nocodeappbuilder.fastmoneynews.com/make-excel-look-like-an-application/|title=Make excel look like an application|date=2020-04-09|website=No Code App Builder|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> and [[Web based presentation tools|presentation tools]]), but can also include more advanced applications such as project management, [[computer-aided design]], [[video editing]], and [[Point of sale|point-of-sale]].\n\n<br />\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Internet}}\n*[[Software as a service|Software as a service (SaaS)]]\n*[[Web 2.0]]\n*[[Web engineering]]\n*[[Web service]]s\n*[[Web Science]]s\n*[[Web widget]]\n*[[Single-page application]]\n*[[Ajax (programming)]]\n*[[Web development tools]]\n*[[Browser game]]\n* [[API economy]]\n* [[Mobile app]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Web-based applications}}\n*[http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/ HTML5 Draft recommendation],  changes to HTML and related APIs to ease authoring of web-based applications.\n*[http://www.paulgraham.com/road.html The Other Road Ahead] &mdash; An article arguing that the future lies on the server, not rich interfaces on the client\n*{{Curlie|Computers/Internet/On_the_Web/Web_Applications|Web Applications}}\n*[http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/ Web Applications Working Group] at the [http://www.w3.org/ World Wide Web Consortium] (W3C)\n\n{{Web interfaces}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Web Application}}\n[[Category:Software architecture]]\n[[Category:Web applications| ]]\n[[Category:Web development]]\n[[Category:User interface techniques]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=February 2018}}\n[[File:Horde-portal.png|thumb|[[Horde (software)|Horde]] [[groupware]] is an [[open-source software|open-source]] web application.]]\nIn computing, a '''web application''' or '''web app''' is a [[Client\u2013server model|client\u2013server]] [[computer program]] that the client (including the user interface and client-side logic) runs in a web browser.

Recently, frameworks allow the development of native apps for all platforms using languages other than each standard native language. \n* Hybrid apps embed a mobile web site inside a native app, possibly using a hybrid framework.  This allows development using web technologies (and possibly directly copying code from an existing mobile web site) while also retaining certain advantages of native apps (e.g. direct access to device hardware, offline operation, app store visibility).\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2018}}\nIn earlier computing models like client\u2013server, the processing load for the application was shared between code on the server and code installed on each client locally.  In other words, an application had its own pre-compiled client program which served as its [[user interface]] and had to be separately installed on each user's [[personal computer]]. An upgrade to the server-side code of the application would typically also require an upgrade to the client-side code installed on each user workstation, adding to the [[technical support|support]] cost and decreasing [[productivity]].  In addition, both the client and server components of the application were usually tightly bound to a particular [[computer architecture]] and [[operating system]] and [[porting]] them to others was often prohibitively expensive for all but the largest applications.  (Nowadays, [[native app]]s for mobile devices are also hobbled by some or all of the foregoing issues.)\n\nIn contrast, web applications use [[web document]]s written in a standard format such as [[HTML]] and [[JavaScript]], which are supported by a variety of web browsers. Web applications can be considered as a specific variant of client\u2013server software where the client software is downloaded to the client machine when visiting the relevant web page, using standard procedures such as [[HTTP]]. Client web software updates may happen each time the web page is visited. During the session, the web browser interprets and displays the pages, and acts as the ''universal'' client for any web application.\n\nIn the early days of the [[World Wide Web|Web]], each individual web page was delivered to the client as a static document, but the sequence of pages could still provide an interactive experience, as user input was returned through web [[Form (web)|form]] elements embedded in the page markup. However, ''every'' significant change to the web page required a round trip back to the server to refresh the entire page.\n\nIn 1995, [[Netscape]] introduced a [[client-side scripting]] language called [[JavaScript]] allowing programmers to add some [[Dynamic HTML|dynamic elements]] to the user interface that ran on the client side. So instead of sending data to the server in order to generate an entire web page, the embedded scripts of the downloaded page can perform various tasks such as input validation or showing/hiding parts of the page.\n\nIn 1996, Macromedia introduced [[Adobe Flash|Flash]], a [[vector graphics|vector animation]] player that could be added to browsers as a [[plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] to embed animations on the web pages. It allowed the use of a scripting language to program interactions on the client side with no need to communicate with the server.\n\nIn 1999, the \"web application\" concept was introduced in the Java language in the Servlet Specification version 2.2. [2.1?].<ref name=\"jgurufaq\">{{cite web | url = http://www.jguru.com/faq/view.jsp?EID=129328 | title = What is a web application (or \"webapp\")? | author = Alex Chaffee | date = 2000-08-17 | accessdate = 2008-07-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | url = http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/download.html | title = Java Servlet Specification (\"Specification\") Version: 2.2 Final Release | author = James Duncan Davidson, Danny Coward | publisher = [[Sun Microsystems]] | pages = 43\u201346 | date = 1999-12-17 | accessdate = 2008-07-27}}</ref> At that time both JavaScript and [[XML]] had already been developed, but [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] had still not yet been coined and the [[XMLHttpRequest]] object had only been recently introduced on Internet Explorer 5 as an ActiveX object.<ref name=\"apple\">{{cite web |url = https://developer.apple.com/internet/webcontent/xmlhttpreq.html | title = Dynamic HTML and XML: The XMLHttpRequest Object | publisher = Apple Inc | accessdate = 2008-06-25}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, the term Ajax was coined, and applications like [[Gmail]] started to make their client sides more and more interactive. A web page script is able to contact the server for storing/retrieving data without downloading an entire web page.\n\nIn 2011, [[HTML5]] was finalized, which provides graphic and multimedia capabilities without the need of client side plug-ins. HTML5 also enriched the semantic content of documents. The APIs and [[document object model]] (DOM) are no longer afterthoughts, but are fundamental parts of the HTML5 specification. [[WebGL]] API paved the way for advanced 3D graphics based on HTML5 canvas and JavaScript language. These have significant importance in creating truly platform and browser independent [[Rich Internet application|rich web applications]].\n\n==Interface==\nThrough [[Java (Sun)|Java]], [[JavaScript]], [[DHTML]], [[Adobe Flash|Flash]], [[Microsoft Silverlight|Silverlight]] and other technologies, application-specific methods such as drawing on the screen, playing audio, and access to the keyboard and mouse are all possible. Many services have worked to combine all of these into a more familiar interface that adopts the appearance of an operating system. General purpose techniques such as [[drag and drop]] are also supported by these technologies. Web developers often use client-side scripting to add functionality, especially to create an interactive experience that does not require page reloading. Recently, technologies have been developed to coordinate client-side scripting with server-side technologies such as [[ASP.NET]], [[J2ee|J2EE]], [[Plack (software)|Perl/Plack]] and [[PHP]].\n\n[[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]], a web development technique using a combination of various technologies, is an example of technology which creates a more interactive experience.\n\n==Structure==\nApplications are usually broken into logical chunks called \"tiers\", where every tier is assigned a role.<ref name=\"ntiered\" /> Traditional applications consist only of 1 tier, which resides on the client machine, but web applications lend themselves to an n-tiered approach by nature.<ref name=\"ntiered\" /> Though many variations are possible, the most common structure is the [[Three-tier (computing)|three-tiered]] application.<ref name=\"ntiered\" /> In its most common form, the three tiers are called ''presentation'', ''application'' and ''storage'', in this order. A web browser is the first tier (presentation), an engine using some dynamic Web content technology (such as [[Active Server Pages|ASP]], [[Common Gateway Interface|CGI]], [[ColdFusion]], [[Dart (programming language)|Dart]], [[Java Servlet|JSP/Java]], [[Node.js]], [[PHP]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]] or [[Ruby on Rails]]) is the middle tier (application logic), and a database is the third tier (storage).<ref name=\"ntiered\" /> The web browser sends requests to the middle tier, which services them by making queries and updates against the database and generates a user interface.\n\nFor more complex applications, a 3-tier solution may fall short, and it may be beneficial to use an n-tiered approach, where the greatest benefit is breaking the business logic, which resides on the application tier, into a more fine-grained model.<ref name=\"ntiered\" /> Another benefit may be adding an integration tier that separates the data tier from the rest of tiers by providing an easy-to-use interface to access the data.<ref name=\"ntiered\" /> For example, the client data would be accessed by calling a \"list_clients()\" function instead of making an SQL query directly against the client table on the database. This allows the underlying database to be replaced without making any change to the other tiers.<ref name=\"ntiered\" />\n\nThere are some who view a web application as a two-tier architecture. This can be a \"smart\" client that performs all the work and queries a \"dumb\" server, or a \"dumb\" client that relies on a \"smart\" server.<ref name=\"ntiered\" /> The client would handle the presentation tier, the server would have the database (storage tier), and the business logic (application tier) would be on one of them or on both.<ref name=\"ntiered\" /> While this increases the scalability of the applications and separates the display and the database, it still doesn't allow for true specialization of layers, so most applications will outgrow this model.<ref name=\"ntiered\">{{cite web|url=http://krunal-ajax-javascript.blogspot.bg/2008/09/benefits-of-using-n-tiered-approach-for.html|title=Benefits of using the n-tiered approach for web applications|author=Jeremy Petersen|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Business use==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2018}}\n\nAn emerging strategy for application software companies is to provide web access to software previously distributed as local applications.  Depending on the type of application, it may require the development of an entirely different browser-based interface, or merely adapting an existing application to use different presentation technology. These programs allow the user to pay a monthly or yearly fee for use of a software application without having to install it on a local hard drive. A company which follows this strategy is known as an [[application service provider]] (ASP), and ASPs are currently receiving much attention in the software industry.\n\nSecurity breaches on these kinds of applications are a major concern because it can involve both enterprise information and private customer data. Protecting these assets is an important part of any web application and there \nare some key operational areas that must be included in the development process.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://content.dell.com/us/en/enterprise/d/large-business/secure-app-development.aspx|title= Top Tips for Secure App Development|publisher=Dell.com | accessdate=2012-06-22}}</ref> This includes processes for authentication, authorization, asset handling, input, and logging and auditing. Building security into the applications from the beginning can be more effective and less disruptive in the long run.\n\n[[Cloud computing]] model web applications are [[software as a service]] (SaaS). There are business applications provided as SaaS for enterprises for a fixed or usage-dependent fee. Other web applications are offered free of charge, often generating income from advertisements shown in web application interface.\n\n==Development==\n{{Main|Web application development}}\nWriting web applications is often simplified by the use of [[web application framework]]. These frameworks facilitate [[rapid application development]] by allowing a development team to focus on the parts of their application which are unique to their goals without having to resolve common development issues such as user management.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://docforge.com/wiki/Web_application_framework | title=Web application framework | author=Multiple (wiki) | work=Docforge | accessdate=2010-03-06 }}</ref> Many of the frameworks in use are [[open-source software]].\n\nThe use of web application frameworks can often reduce the number of errors in a program, both by making the code simpler, and by allowing one team to concentrate on the framework while another focuses on a specified use case.  In applications which are exposed to constant [[Hacker (computer security)|hacking]] attempts on the Internet, [[Software Development Security|security-related]] problems can be caused by errors in the program. Frameworks can also promote the use of best practices<ref>{{cite web | url=http://docforge.com/wiki/Framework | title=Framework | author=Multiple (wiki) | work=Docforge | accessdate=2010-03-06 }}</ref> such as [[Post/Redirect/Get|GET after POST]].\n\nIn addition, there is potential for the development of applications on [[Internet operating system]]s, although currently there are not many viable platforms that fit this model.\n\n==Applications==\nExamples of browser applications are simple office software ([[word processor]]s, [[List of online spreadsheets|online spreadsheets]], and [[Web based presentation tools|presentation tools]]), but can also include more advanced applications such as project management, [[computer-aided design]], [[video editing]], and [[Point of sale|point-of-sale]].\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Internet}}\n*[[Software as a service|Software as a service (SaaS)]]\n*[[Web 2.0]]\n*[[Web engineering]]\n*[[Web service]]s\n*[[Web Science]]s\n*[[Web widget]]\n*[[Single-page application]]\n*[[Ajax (programming)]]\n*[[Web development tools]]\n*[[Browser game]]\n* [[API economy]]\n* [[Mobile app]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Web-based applications}}\n*[http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/ HTML5 Draft recommendation],  changes to HTML and related APIs to ease authoring of web-based applications.\n*[http://www.paulgraham.com/road.html The Other Road Ahead] &mdash; An article arguing that the future lies on the server, not rich interfaces on the client\n*{{Curlie|Computers/Internet/On_the_Web/Web_Applications|Web Applications}}\n*[http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/ Web Applications Working Group] at the [http://www.w3.org/ World Wide Web Consortium] (W3C)\n\n{{Web interfaces}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Web Application}}\n[[Category:Software architecture]]\n[[Category:Web applications| ]]\n[[Category:Web development]]\n[[Category:User interface techniques]]\n", "name_user": "Nocodeappbuilder", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eReferences:see an example of excel to web app)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application"}

({{IPA-es|\u02c8santos la\u02c8\u0263una}}), commonly known as '''Santos Laguna''' or '''Santos''', is a Mexican professional [[Association football|football]] club who were the champions of the Liga MX Clausura. Located in northern Mexico and representing the urban area of La [[Comarca Lagunera]], made up of [[Torre\u00f3n Municipality|Torre\u00f3n]], [[G\u00f3mez Palacio Municipality|G\u00f3mez Palacio]] and [[Lerdo Municipality|Lerdo]] municipalities and straddling [[Durango]] and [[Coahuila]] states, Santos Laguna plays in [[Liga MX]].\n\nSantos Laguna was founded in 1983 and reached Mexico's top division after buying the [[\u00c1ngeles de Puebla]] club. The club debuted in Mexico's top division in the 1988\u201389 tournament. They have won six tournaments: [[Primera Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico Invierno 1996|Invierno 1996]], [[Primera Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico Verano 2001|Verano 2001]], [[Primera Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico Clausura 2008|Clausura 2008]], [[2011\u201312 Primera Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico season#Torneo Clausura|Clausura 2012]], [[2014\u201315 Liga MX season#Torneo Clausura|Clausura 2015]], [[2017\u201318 Liga MX season#Torneo Clausura|Clausura 2018]].

Santos Laguna won the Apertura 2014 [[Copa MX]].\n\nSantos is the third football club formed in the Laguna region, after the unsuccessful Laguna Football Club and Football Club Torreon (which formed the Black Lions of the University Deportivo Guadalajara and Neza, respectively). In 2018, the club celebrated its 35th anniversary with a change in their logo. In a February 17, 2013 poll, by Consulta Mitofsky,<ref>[http://www.cronica.com.mx/notas/2013/731578.html Chivas y Am\u00e9rica: los m\u00e1s populares] (10 de marzo de 2013) (Spanish)</ref> it was the fifth-most-popular team in Mexico.\n\n==History==\n\n==={{anchor|Foundation and early years}}Formation and early years===\nSantos Laguna was founded in 1983 by the [[Mexican Social Security Institute]] (IMSS) of the state of [[Durango]] as Santos IMSS. Since the late 1970s, the IMSS had sponsored a national football tournament with teams from across the country. Jose Diaz Couder, IMSS head of social services in [[G\u00f3mez Palacio, Durango|G\u00f3mez Palacio]], was invited to participate in the tournaments despite the fact that he did not have a team. He appealed to the players he knew to form a team, based on [[Asturias F.C.]]\n\nIn 1987 Tuberos de Veracruz, part of the [[Segunda Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico]], was purchased by IMSS and moved to [[Santa Cruz Tlaxcala (municipality)|Santa Cruz, Tlaxcala]]. The first Santos Laguna team spent less than a year in Tlaxcala before moving to G\u00f3mez Palacio. A lack of facilities spurred efforts to obtain Moctezuma Stadium (Estadio Corona) in Torreon, owned by John Abusaid, and the Saints made their first home in the former Estadio Corona. On September 4, 1988 Los Guerreros played their first game as Santos Laguna, winning 2\u20130.\n\n===={{anchor|Segunda Division \"A\"}}Segunda Division A====\nWhen the IMSS sold its professional sports clubs, Salvador Necochea Sagi bought Santos Laguna. In their first year in the Second Division A, the Warriors avoided relegation with three wins, two draws and one loss. William (the Clash) Galindo, Carlos Gonz\u00e1lez, Julio Cesar Armend\u00e1riz, Tomas Moreno and Fernando de la Rosa were notable players.\n\nIn 1989 Los Guerreros earned their nickname when, after a poor start, they finished 10th. Their fan base grew, and the club's owners bought the first Estadio Corona. The club underwent changes the following year, replacing its logo with the current one and playing in green and white stripes. Of the 18 founding members of the Second Division B, two won promotion to the first division: the Autonomous University of Tamaulipas and Santos Laguna.\n\n===Promotion to Primera Division===\n[[File:Juan Pablo Rodr\u00edguez.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Juan Pablo Rodr\u00edguez]], footballer with more presences in the history of the club.]]\nIn 1988 Santos Laguna purchased the Puebla Angels, giving them Cristian Saavedra, Wilson Graniolatti, Martin Zuniga and Miguel Herrera and a record of three wins, four draws and one loss. Lucas Ochoa scored the club's first First Division goal and the Warriors, led by Carlos Ortiz, avoided relegation with Herrera's two goals paving the way for a 3\u20131 defeat of Atletico in Potosino.\n\nIn 1991, Grupo Modelo became majority owner of the club and Ramon Ramirez made his First Division debut with a goal against Club Deportivo Guadalajara. Late the following year, club president Armando Navarro Gasc\u00f3n and his wife were killed in an automobile accident.\n\nPresident Alberto Canedo and Chilean coach [[Pedro Garc\u00eda Barros|Pedro Garc\u00eda]] arrived in 1993. Grupo Modelo made a strong investment in reinforcements, Antonio \"El Turco\" Apud, [[Daniel Guzm\u00e1n]], Olaf Heredia, Diego Silva, [[H\u00e9ctor Adomaitis]] and Richard Zambrano who joined players coming from Second Division such as Jos\u00e9 Guadalupe Rubio and Pedro Mu\u00f1oz. The 1993\u201394 season saw the team for the first time qualify for the playoffs in the First Division and managed to reach the final coinciding with their tenth anniversary of founding, though lost in overtime in the second leg of the final against Club Deportivo Estudiantes Tecos who were coached by [[Victor Manuel Vucetich]].\n\nIn 1994, key player [[Ram\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez (footballer)|Ram\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez]] left for Guadalajara but Santos qualified for the playoffs a second time. Los Guerreros participated in the 1995 [[CONCACAF]] Champions Cup, and were eliminated in the first round by Deportivo FAS of El Salvador. Argentine [[Mauro Camoranesi]] played 13 games with Santos, scoring one goal before returning to Uruguay. Other notable players that season and the following one were [[Gabriel Caballero]], [[Francisco Gabriel de Anda]] and [[Miguel Espa\u00f1a]].\n\nChilean Cristian Montecinos reached the third league during the 1996 regular season, and Santos Laguna won their first First Divisi\u00f3n title with new player [[Jared Borghetti]]. In the Verano 1997 tournament, Santos Laguna was eliminated by Guadalajara 5\u20130 in the Estadio Jalisco. Santos Laguna played poorly in the Invierno 1997 tournament, winning three games out of 17 and tied for last in the standings with Pumas UNAM and UAG Tecos. In 1998 the club reached one of the two [[Copa Libertadores#Renaissance: 1990\u20131999|qualifying finals]] for the [[Copa Libertadores]], which was played on September 9 in [[Los Angeles]].\n\n==={{anchor|2000 years}}2000s===\n[[File:Club_Santos_Laguna,_2013.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A match between Santos Laguna and [[Houston Dynamo]] corresponding to the quarterfinals of the [[Concacaf Champions League]] 2012-2013.]]\nIn the summer 2000 season, Santos Laguna was strengthened by the arrivals of Rodrigo Ruiz and Luis Romero. During the regular season, the Warriors lost only two games and finished second in the overall standings behind Toluca.\n\nIn the 2001 summer season, the club won their second league championship. During the winter 2001 season Santos Laguna, with eight losses, failed to qualify for the play-offs and finished eighth overall. In summer 2002, the Warriors were fourth in the overall standings but were eliminated 1\u20130 in the semi-finals by Necaxa at the Estadio Corona. Santos Laguna qualified for the CONCACAF Champions Cup that year for the second time. The Warriors defeated Tauro FC of Panama by aggregate score of 5\u20133; in the next round, at home, Santos Laguna lost 3\u20132 overall to the U.S. champion Kansas City Wizards. At the end of the summer tournament, Fernando Quirarte and his coaching staff stepped down; Quirarte was replaced by Sergio Bueno, who was soon sacked in favor of Luis Fernando Tena. Finishing eighth overall, Santos Laguna defeated defending champion and leader Global America 5\u20134 at Azteca Stadium. The Warriors qualified for the group stage of the Merconorte Cup, defeating the Kansas City Wizards and Barcelona of Guayaquil twice each and Sporting Cristal once; their only loss was to Sporting Cristal, 2\u20131.\n\nFor the 2003 Apertura tournament (the club's 20th anniversary) reinforcements arrived in the form of Vicente Matias Vuoso and Sixto Peralta, Argentines who had played for Manchester City and Inter Milan. In the match at Estadio Corona against Monterrey, 10 goals were scored. The Warriors qualified for the play-offs, but were eliminated in the quarter-finals, Luis Fernando Tena's contract was not renewed, and he was replaced by Eduardo De la Torre.\n\nThe Warriors began 2004 well, qualifying for the Copa Libertadores by defeating Atlas Guadalajara 4\u20133, but were injured, inconsistent and tired in the Clausura. The club, put up for sale, was in a precarious financial position but played two tournaments and finished 14th overall. In the Copa Libertadores, despite unpaid wages, Santos Laguna ended the group stage undefeated. In the second round, the Warriors were eliminated by River Plate after a struggle.\n\nDuring Apertura 2004 the club was abandoned by the Ministry of Finance, who withdrew financial support and returned it to former owner Grupo Modelo with instructions not to invest more money in the franchise until current owner Carlos Ahumada Kurtz solved his legal problems. The club payroll was restructured, players were cut and Santos Laguna did not qualify for the play-offs.\n\nIn the 2005 Clausura, the Warriors' Vicente Matias Vuoso won the scoring championship with 15 points and Rodrigo Ruiz set a Mexican record for scoring passes with 12 assists. Santos Laguna was plagued by injuries during the Apertura tournament. The Clausura 2006 tournament was disastrous for the club.\n\n{{football squad on pitch|align=right\n|  GK = '''[[Oswaldo S\u00e1nchez|S\u00e1nchez (C)]]'''\n|  RB = '''[[Iv\u00e1n Estrada|Estrada]]'''\n| RCB = '''[[Rafael Figueroa|Figueroa]]'''\n| LCB = '''[[Fernando Ortiz (footballer)|Ortiz]]'''\n|  LB = '''[[Edgar Castillo|Castillo]]'''\n|  RM = '''[[Fernando Arce|Arce]]'''\n|  LM = '''[[Daniel Ludue\u00f1a|Ludue\u00f1a]]'''\n| RCM = '''[[Juan Pablo Rodr\u00edguez|Rodr\u00edguez]]'''\n| LCF = '''[[Vicente Mat\u00edas Vuoso|Vuoso]]'''\n| LCM = '''[[Walter Jim\u00e9nez|Jim\u00e9nez]]'''\n| RCF = '''[[Christian Ben\u00edtez|Ben\u00edtez]]'''\n| caption = [[Primera Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico Clausura 2008|Clausura 2008]] champions\n}}\n\nThe Apertura 2007 was one of the team's best seasons. With the arrival of the Ecuadorian Christian Benitez, Santos Laguna lost only one match and was visited by Pele.\nFor the Clausura 2008, the club scored 36 goals in the regular season. On June 1, 2008 Santos Laguna won their third Clausura championship, defeating Cruz Azul. The club began Apertura 2008 at Azteca Stadium against America.\n\nClausura 2009 was disastrous for the Warriors; coach Daniel Guzman was dismissed and replaced by Sergio Bueno, and the club's fortunes improved somewhat. In the CONCACAF Champions League quarter-finals against the Montreal Impact in Montreal's Olympic Stadium before a crowd of 55,571, the Impact surprised and won 2\u20130.

However, Santos did not qualify for the play-offs and was unable to repeat its championship. At the end of the season, Benjam\u00edn Galindo sacked his two assistants before he himself was dismissed.\n\nIn the Clausura 2013, Portuguese manager [[Pedro Caixinha]] was hired based on a recommendation by former Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho.

Santos Laguna finished sixth during the regular season. They defeated Atlas 3\u20131 on aggregate in the quarter-finals and lost to Cruz Azul 0\u20133 and 2\u20131 in the semi-finals.

In 2000, Santos Laguna signed a sponsorship agreement with [[Soriana]].\n{{clear}}\n\n==={{anchor|Kits}}Kit===\n<center>\n{|\n| \n{{Football kit | pattern_la = _whiteborder | pattern_b = _whitesides2 | pattern_ra = _whiteborder | pattern_so = _band_white | leftarm = 008000 | body = 008000 | rightarm = 008000 | shorts = 008000 | socks = FFFFFF | title = 1983\u201384}}\n|\n{{Football kit | pattern_la = _white_hoops | pattern_b = _whitehoops | pattern_ra = _white_hoops | pattern_so = _band_white | leftarm = 0B610B | body = 006633 | rightarm = 0B610B | shorts = 0B610B | socks = FFFFFF | title = 1996\u201397}}\n|\n{{Football kit | pattern_la = _green_shoulders | pattern_b = _whitehoops | pattern_ra = _green_shoulders | pattern_so = _band_white | leftarm = FFFFFF | body = 008000 | rightarm = FFFFFF | shorts = 088A08 | socks = FFFFFF | title = 2000\u201301}}\n|\n{{Football kit | pattern_la = _white_hoops | pattern_b = _whitehoops | pattern_ra = _white_hoops | leftarm = 008000 | body = 008000 | rightarm = 008000 | shorts = 008000 | socks = FFFFFF | title = 2007\u201308}}\n|\n{{Football kit | pattern_la =_whiteborder | pattern_b =_3stripesonwhite| pattern_ra = _whiteborder | leftarm = FFFFFF | body = 008000 | rightarm = FFFFFF | shorts = FFFFFF | socks = 008000 | title = 2008\u201309}}\n|\n{{Football kit | pattern_la = _celtic1213h | pattern_b = _guarani11t | pattern_ra = _celtic1213h | pattern_so = _hoops_green_2 | leftarm = 008000 | body = 008000 | rightarm = 008000 | shorts = FFFFFF | socks = FFFFFF | title = 2009\u201310}}\n|}\n</center>\n\n<center>\n{|\n|\n{{Football kit | pattern_la = _thin black hoops | pattern_b = _thingreenhoops | pattern_ra = _thin black hoops| leftarm        = 008000 | body = 000000 | rightarm  = 008000 | shorts = 000000 | socks = 000000| title = 2010}}\n|\n{{Football kit | pattern_la=_slaguna1011h | pattern_b=_slaguna1011h | pattern_ra=_slaguna1011h | pattern_sh= _slaguna1011h | pattern_so= _3whitebands | leftarm=FFFFFF | body=FFFFFF | rightarm=FFFFFF | shorts=000001 | socks=009900 | title = 2011}}\n|\n{{Football kit | pattern_la=_slaguna1112h| pattern_b=_slaguna1112h | pattern_ra=_slaguna1112h | pattern_sh=_white_stripes | pattern_so=_slaguna1112h | leftarm=FFFFFF | body=FFFFFF | rightarm=FFFFFF | shorts=006000 | socks=FFFFFF | title = 2012}}\n|\n{{Football kit |pattern_la =_slaguna1213h | pattern_b=_slaguna1213h | pattern_ra =_slaguna1213h | pattern_sh=_white stripes | pattern_so=_slaguna1213h | leftarm=000040 | body=000040 | rightarm=000040 | shorts=006000 | socks=000040 | title = 2013}}\n|\n{{Football kit | pattern_la=_slaguna1213t | pattern_b=_slaguna1213t | pattern_ra=_slaguna1213t | pattern_sh=_white stripes | pattern_so=_slaguna1213h | leftarm=FFFFFF | body=FFFFFF | rightarm=FFFFFF | shorts=006000 | socks=00FF40 | title = 30th-anniversary edition}}\n|\n{{Football kit | pattern_la =_slaguna1314h | pattern_b=_slaguna1314h | pattern_ra =_slaguna1314h | pattern_sh=_slaguna1314h | pattern_so=_slaguna1314h | leftarm=000040 | body=000040 | rightarm=000040 | shorts=006000 | socks=000040 | title = 2014}}\n|}\n</center>\n\n==Grounds==\n===Corona Stadium===\n[[File:Estadio corona.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=Football pitch after a goal was scored|[[Estadio Corona (1970)|Old Corona Stadium (1970-2009)]]]]\nCorona Stadium, in [[Torre\u00f3n, Coahuila]], was one of the smallest [[Association football|football]] stadiums in Mexico with a capacity of 20,100. Known as Montezuma Stadium, it opened on July 2, 1970, for a friendly match between the now-defunct [[Club de F\u00fatbol Torre\u00f3n|CF Torre\u00f3n]] and [[C.D. Guadalajara|Guadalajara]]. The stadium was demolished on November 2, 2009.\n\n===New Corona Stadium===\nSantos Laguna plays at the $100 million [[Estadio Corona]], with a capacity of 30,050. Construction began on February 22, 2008, and on November 11, 2009, the stadium opened for a friendly match between Santos Laguna and [[Santos FC]] from the Brazilian [[S\u00e9rie A]]. The sellout crowd included Mexican president [[Felipe Calder\u00f3n]] and Brazilian legend [[Pel\u00e9]]. Santos Laguna won, 2\u20131.\n\n[[File:Un partido de Santos Laguna vs. Gimnasia de La Plata.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=Football pitch during a game, seen from one end|[[Estadio Corona (2009)|New Corona Stadium (2009-)]]]]\n\n\n==Symbols==\n\n==={{anchor|Logo}}Insignia===\n[[File:SantosLagunaLogo2008.png|100px|thumb|alt=Green Gothic \"S\" under a gold halo|Club logo]]\n\nSantos Laguna's home colors are green and white. When Santos Laguna was founded in 1983, its crest was white with green stripes and letters (similar to that of [[Santos FC]]). In 1991, when [[Grupo Modelo]] bought the club, the crest became similar to the current one. In 1996, a star was added to the badge after winning their first title in the [[1996\u201397 Mexican Primera Divisi\u00f3n season#Tornero Invierno 1996|Invierno 1996]] tournament. After winning their second title in 2001, another star was added and switched to a darker shade of green with a black outline. As of 2012, the stars have been placed outside of the badge. In 2018, the club used a special badge, incorporating the number '35' for the club's 35th anniversary. A sixth star was added after winning the [[2017\u201318 Liga MX season#Torneo Clausura|Clausura 2018]] tournament.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clubsantos.mx/contenidos/escudo|title=Escudo|language=Spanish|accessdate=23 June 2018|trans-title=Badge|work=clubsantos.mx}}</ref>\n\n{{Gallery\n|align=center\n|File:Santos Laguna.png\n|Badge style in use since 2012.\n}}\n\n==={{anchor|Anthem}}Songs===\nIn 1991, when the club was in danger of relegation to the second division, Santos adopted their first team song: \"Es hora de ganar\", by [[Ricardo Serna]]. In April 1994, Serna wrote \"Santos Campeon\". Two years later, Chilean composer Martin Ibarreche Wilt Labarca was commissioned to write \"Verdiblanco el corazon\". In 1997 Serna wrote \"Hymn to the Fans\", and in May 2001 the club introduced \"Venceremos\".

They have won six tournaments: [[Primera Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico Invierno 1996|Invierno 1996]], [[Primera Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico Verano 2001|Verano 2001]], [[Primera Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico Clausura 2008|Clausura 2008]], [[2011\u201312 Primera Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico season#Torneo Clausura|Clausura 2012]], [[2014\u201315 Liga MX season#Torneo Clausura|Clausura 2015]], [[2017\u201318 Liga MX season#Torneo Clausura|Clausura 2018]]. The club reached the finals in [[1993-94 Mexican Primera Divisi\u00f3n season|the 1993\u201394 season]], [[Primera Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico Verano 2000|Verano 2000]], [[2009\u201310 Primera Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico season#Torneo Bicentenario|Bicentenario 2010]], [[2010\u201311 Primera Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico season|Apertura 2010]] and [[2011\u201312 Primera Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico season|Apertura 2011]]. Santos Laguna won the Apertura 2014 [[Copa MX]].\n\nSantos is the third football club formed in the Laguna region, after the unsuccessful Laguna Football Club and Football Club Torreon (which formed the Black Lions of the University Deportivo Guadalajara and Neza, respectively). In 2018, the club celebrated its 35th anniversary with a change in their logo. In a February 17, 2013 poll, by Consulta Mitofsky,<ref>[http://www.cronica.com.mx/notas/2013/731578.html Chivas y Am\u00e9rica: los m\u00e1s populares] (10 de marzo de 2013) (Spanish)</ref> it was the fifth-most-popular team in Mexico.\n\n==History==\n\n==={{anchor|Foundation and early years}}Formation and early years===\nSantos Laguna was founded in 1983 by the [[Mexican Social Security Institute]] (IMSS) of the state of [[Durango]] as Santos IMSS. Since the late 1970s, the IMSS had sponsored a national football tournament with teams from across the country. Jose Diaz Couder, IMSS head of social services in [[G\u00f3mez Palacio, Durango|G\u00f3mez Palacio]], was invited to participate in the tournaments despite the fact that he did not have a team. He appealed to the players he knew to form a team, based on [[Asturias F.C.]]\n\nIn 1987 Tuberos de Veracruz, part of the [[Segunda Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico]], was purchased by IMSS and moved to [[Santa Cruz Tlaxcala (municipality)|Santa Cruz, Tlaxcala]]. The first Santos Laguna team spent less than a year in Tlaxcala before moving to G\u00f3mez Palacio. A lack of facilities spurred efforts to obtain Moctezuma Stadium (Estadio Corona) in Torreon, owned by John Abusaid, and the Saints made their first home in the former Estadio Corona. On September 4, 1988 Los Guerreros played their first game as Santos Laguna, winning 2\u20130.\n\n===={{anchor|Segunda Division \"A\"}}Segunda Division A====\nWhen the IMSS sold its professional sports clubs, Salvador Necochea Sagi bought Santos Laguna. In their first year in the Second Division A, the Warriors avoided relegation with three wins, two draws and one loss. William (the Clash) Galindo, Carlos Gonz\u00e1lez, Julio Cesar Armend\u00e1riz, Tomas Moreno and Fernando de la Rosa were notable players.\n\nIn 1989 Los Guerreros earned their nickname when, after a poor start, they finished 10th. Their fan base grew, and the club's owners bought the first Estadio Corona. The club underwent changes the following year, replacing its logo with the current one and playing in green and white stripes. Of the 18 founding members of the Second Division B, two won promotion to the first division: the Autonomous University of Tamaulipas and Santos Laguna.\n\n===Promotion to Primera Division===\n[[File:Juan Pablo Rodr\u00edguez.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Juan Pablo Rodr\u00edguez]], footballer with more presences in the history of the club.]]\nIn 1988 Santos Laguna purchased the Puebla Angels, giving them Cristian Saavedra, Wilson Graniolatti, Martin Zuniga and Miguel Herrera and a record of three wins, four draws and one loss. Lucas Ochoa scored the club's first First Division goal and the Warriors, led by Carlos Ortiz, avoided relegation with Herrera's two goals paving the way for a 3\u20131 defeat of Atletico in Potosino.\n\nIn 1991, Grupo Modelo became majority owner of the club and Ramon Ramirez made his First Division debut with a goal against Club Deportivo Guadalajara. Late the following year, club president Armando Navarro Gasc\u00f3n and his wife were killed in an automobile accident.\n\nPresident Alberto Canedo and Chilean coach [[Pedro Garc\u00eda Barros|Pedro Garc\u00eda]] arrived in 1993. Grupo Modelo made a strong investment in reinforcements, Antonio \"El Turco\" Apud, [[Daniel Guzm\u00e1n]], Olaf Heredia, Diego Silva, [[H\u00e9ctor Adomaitis]] and Richard Zambrano who joined players coming from Second Division such as Jos\u00e9 Guadalupe Rubio and Pedro Mu\u00f1oz. The 1993\u201394 season saw the team for the first time qualify for the playoffs in the First Division and managed to reach the final coinciding with their tenth anniversary of founding, though lost in overtime in the second leg of the final against Club Deportivo Estudiantes Tecos who were coached by [[Victor Manuel Vucetich]].\n\nIn 1994, key player [[Ram\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez (footballer)|Ram\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez]] left for Guadalajara but Santos qualified for the playoffs a second time. Los Guerreros participated in the 1995 [[CONCACAF]] Champions Cup, and were eliminated in the first round by Deportivo FAS of El Salvador. Argentine [[Mauro Camoranesi]] played 13 games with Santos, scoring one goal before returning to Uruguay. Other notable players that season and the following one were [[Gabriel Caballero]], [[Francisco Gabriel de Anda]] and [[Miguel Espa\u00f1a]].\n\nChilean Cristian Montecinos reached the third league during the 1996 regular season, and Santos Laguna won their first First Divisi\u00f3n title with new player [[Jared Borghetti]]. In the Verano 1997 tournament, Santos Laguna was eliminated by Guadalajara 5\u20130 in the Estadio Jalisco. Santos Laguna played poorly in the Invierno 1997 tournament, winning three games out of 17 and tied for last in the standings with Pumas UNAM and UAG Tecos. In 1998 the club reached one of the two [[Copa Libertadores#Renaissance: 1990\u20131999|qualifying finals]] for the [[Copa Libertadores]], which was played on September 9 in [[Los Angeles]].\n\n==={{anchor|2000 years}}2000s===\n[[File:Club_Santos_Laguna,_2013.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A match between Santos Laguna and [[Houston Dynamo]] corresponding to the quarterfinals of the [[Concacaf Champions League]] 2012-2013.]]\nIn the summer 2000 season, Santos Laguna was strengthened by the arrivals of Rodrigo Ruiz and Luis Romero. During the regular season, the Warriors lost only two games and finished second in the overall standings behind Toluca.\n\nIn the 2001 summer season, the club won their second league championship. During the winter 2001 season Santos Laguna, with eight losses, failed to qualify for the play-offs and finished eighth overall. In summer 2002, the Warriors were fourth in the overall standings but were eliminated 1\u20130 in the semi-finals by Necaxa at the Estadio Corona. Santos Laguna qualified for the CONCACAF Champions Cup that year for the second time. The Warriors defeated Tauro FC of Panama by aggregate score of 5\u20133; in the next round, at home, Santos Laguna lost 3\u20132 overall to the U.S. champion Kansas City Wizards. At the end of the summer tournament, Fernando Quirarte and his coaching staff stepped down; Quirarte was replaced by Sergio Bueno, who was soon sacked in favor of Luis Fernando Tena. Finishing eighth overall, Santos Laguna defeated defending champion and leader Global America 5\u20134 at Azteca Stadium. The Warriors qualified for the group stage of the Merconorte Cup, defeating the Kansas City Wizards and Barcelona of Guayaquil twice each and Sporting Cristal once; their only loss was to Sporting Cristal, 2\u20131.\n\nFor the 2003 Apertura tournament (the club's 20th anniversary) reinforcements arrived in the form of Vicente Matias Vuoso and Sixto Peralta, Argentines who had played for Manchester City and Inter Milan. In the match at Estadio Corona against Monterrey, 10 goals were scored. The Warriors qualified for the play-offs, but were eliminated in the quarter-finals, Luis Fernando Tena's contract was not renewed, and he was replaced by Eduardo De la Torre.\n\nThe Warriors began 2004 well, qualifying for the Copa Libertadores by defeating Atlas Guadalajara 4\u20133, but were injured, inconsistent and tired in the Clausura. The club, put up for sale, was in a precarious financial position but played two tournaments and finished 14th overall. In the Copa Libertadores, despite unpaid wages, Santos Laguna ended the group stage undefeated. In the second round, the Warriors were eliminated by River Plate after a struggle.\n\nDuring Apertura 2004 the club was abandoned by the Ministry of Finance, who withdrew financial support and returned it to former owner Grupo Modelo with instructions not to invest more money in the franchise until current owner Carlos Ahumada Kurtz solved his legal problems. The club payroll was restructured, players were cut and Santos Laguna did not qualify for the play-offs.\n\nIn the 2005 Clausura, the Warriors' Vicente Matias Vuoso won the scoring championship with 15 points and Rodrigo Ruiz set a Mexican record for scoring passes with 12 assists. Santos Laguna was plagued by injuries during the Apertura tournament. The Clausura 2006 tournament was disastrous for the club.\n\n{{football squad on pitch|align=right\n|  GK = '''[[Oswaldo S\u00e1nchez|S\u00e1nchez (C)]]'''\n|  RB = '''[[Iv\u00e1n Estrada|Estrada]]'''\n| RCB = '''[[Rafael Figueroa|Figueroa]]'''\n| LCB = '''[[Fernando Ortiz (footballer)|Ortiz]]'''\n|  LB = '''[[Edgar Castillo|Castillo]]'''\n|  RM = '''[[Fernando Arce|Arce]]'''\n|  LM = '''[[Daniel Ludue\u00f1a|Ludue\u00f1a]]'''\n| RCM = '''[[Juan Pablo Rodr\u00edguez|Rodr\u00edguez]]'''\n| LCF = '''[[Vicente Mat\u00edas Vuoso|Vuoso]]'''\n| LCM = '''[[Walter Jim\u00e9nez|Jim\u00e9nez]]'''\n| RCF = '''[[Christian Ben\u00edtez|Ben\u00edtez]]'''\n| caption = [[Primera Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico Clausura 2008|Clausura 2008]] champions\n}}\n\nThe Apertura 2007 was one of the team's best seasons. With the arrival of the Ecuadorian Christian Benitez, Santos Laguna lost only one match and was visited by Pele.\nFor the Clausura 2008, the club scored 36 goals in the regular season. On June 1, 2008 Santos Laguna won their third Clausura championship, defeating Cruz Azul. The club began Apertura 2008 at Azteca Stadium against America.\n\nClausura 2009 was disastrous for the Warriors; coach Daniel Guzman was dismissed and replaced by Sergio Bueno, and the club's fortunes improved somewhat. In the CONCACAF Champions League quarter-finals against the Montreal Impact in Montreal's Olympic Stadium before a crowd of 55,571, the Impact surprised and won 2\u20130. Apertura 2009 opened the Nuevo Estadio Corona; Bueno was dismissed and replaced by Ruben Omar Romano.\n\n==={{anchor|2010 years}}2010s===\n{{football squad on pitch|align=right\n|  GK = '''[[Oswaldo S\u00e1nchez|S\u00e1nchez (C)]]'''\n|  RB = '''[[Jorge Iv\u00e1n Estrada|Estrada]]'''\n| RCB = '''[[Aar\u00f3n Galindo|Galindo]]'''\n| LCB = '''[[Felipe Baloy|Baloy]]'''\n|  LB = '''[[Osmar Mares|Mares]]'''\n|  RM = '''[[Carlos Darwin Quintero|Quintero]]'''\n|  LM = '''[[Christian Su\u00e1rez|Su\u00e1rez]]'''\n| RCM = '''[[Juan Pablo Rodr\u00edguez|Rodr\u00edguez]]'''\n|  AM = '''[[Daniel Ludue\u00f1a|Ludue\u00f1a]]'''\n| LCM = '''[[Rodolfo Salinas|Salinas]]'''\n|  CF = '''[[Oribe Peralta|Peralta]]'''\n| caption = [[2011\u201312 Mexican Primera Divisi\u00f3n season|Clausura 2012]] champions\n}}\n\nIn 2010 Santos fell just short of the title, losing 4\u20133 to Toluca. For the Apertura Christian Benitez returned to the club, contributing to their rise to the top of the table and scoring 14 goals. The Saints lost 3\u20130 to Monterrey, their second consecutive final loss.\nIn the Clausura Ruben Omar Romano, unpopular with fans, was dismissed on February 20, 2011. Two days later, Diego Cocca debuted as coach in a 2\u20130 loss to Cruz Azul. Cocca lost his first six games before a 3\u20130 Week 12 victory over Cruz Azul, and the team did not qualify for the play-offs.\n\nCocca began Apertura 2011 with the support of the board and players, he was dismissed on September 3 and Eduardo Rergis became the interim coach. On September 12 Benjamin Galindo was appointed as new coach, with Hector Lopez his assistant. Under Galindo, Santos won five consecutive games and reached fourth place.\n\nIn the 2011\u201312 CONCACAF Champions League, Santos defeated the [[Seattle Sounders FC]] in the quarter-finals and [[Toronto FC]] in the semi-finals. In the final, the club lost to Rayados of Monterrey. In the 2012 Clausura, Santos Laguna finished in first place for the second time in its history. In the quarter-finals, the club won 6\u20134 on aggregate. The first game of the semi-finals, against the UANL Tigres at the Estadio Universitario, ended in a 1\u20131 draw and Santos won the second game to advance to the final. After playing Monterrey to a 1\u20131 draw at Estadio Tecnologico, Santos Laguna won the second game 2\u20131 with goals by Daniel Ludue\u00f1a and Oribe Peralta for the club's fourth title.\n\nThe Apertura 2012 featured Edgar Gerardo Lugo and rising defensive stars Monarcas Morelia and Oswaldo Alanis. However, Santos did not qualify for the play-offs and was unable to repeat its championship. At the end of the season, Benjam\u00edn Galindo sacked his two assistants before he himself was dismissed.\n\nIn the Clausura 2013, Portuguese manager [[Pedro Caixinha]] was hired based on a recommendation by former Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho. Daniel Ludue\u00f1a and Christian Suarez were transferred to the Pachuca Soccer Club in exchange for Mauro Cejas, Nestor Calderon and promising Colombian Andres Renteria. Santos Laguna finished sixth during the regular season. They defeated Atlas 3\u20131 on aggregate in the quarter-finals and lost to Cruz Azul 0\u20133 and 2\u20131 in the semi-finals. In the 2012\u201313 CONCACAF Champions League, Santos again reached the final against Club de F\u00fatbol Monterrey. The first game was a scoreless tie, and Monterrey won the second game 4\u20132.\n\nFor the Apertura 2013, Santos sold Ivan Estrada to Pachuca and transferred Herculez Gomez, Gerardo Lugo and Aaron Galindo. After the June purchase of Grupo Modelo by Belgian-Brazilian company AB InBev, on August 8 Grupo Modelo announced the sale of Santos Laguna to new company Orlegi Sports (led by Alejandro Irarragorri and other Mexican businessmen). The new owners said that they would continue their sponsorship.\n\nAfter defeating [[Atlante F.C.|Atlante]] 3\u20131 in the latter half of the [[2013\u201314 Liga MX season|Apertura 2013]], Santos Laguna secured a berth in the [[2014 Copa Libertadores|Copa Libertadores]] for the second time in their history.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.vavel.com/mx/futbol-mexicano/2013/10/27/santos-laguna/274012.html | language=Spanish | date=27 October 2013 | author=Borboa, Salvador | publisher=Vavel | title=Santos, el primer clasificado a la Copa Libertadores | accessdate=12 April 2020}}</ref> ''Los Guerreros'' finished undefeated at the top of Group 8, which included [[2012\u201313 Copa Argentina|Copa Argentina winners]] [[Arsenal de Sarand\u00ed]], [[2012\u201313 Uruguayan Primera Divisi\u00f3n season|Uruguayan league champions]] [[Pe\u00f1arol]] and [[2012\u201313 Venezuelan Primera Divisi\u00f3n season|Venezuelan league runners-up]] [[Deportivo Anzo\u00e1tegui S.C.|Deportivo Anzo\u00e1tegui]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.espn.com.mx/noticias/nota?s=mex&id=2045086&type=story | language=Spanish | date=17 March 2014 | author=Padilla, Cristian | publisher=ESPN | title=Santos Laguna, en 2 participaciones, tiene buenos n\u00fameros en Libertadores | accessdate=12 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://expansion.mx/deportes/2014/02/18/santos-vence-2-0-al-penarol-y-es-lider-de-grupo-en-la-copa-libertadores | language=Spanish | date=18 February 2014 | author=Reuters | publisher=Expansi\u00f3n | title=Santos vence 2-0 al Pe\u00f1arol y es l\u00edder de grupo en la Copa Libertadores | accessdate=12 April 2020}}</ref> In the away leg of the Round of 16, Santos Laguna faced Argentinian side [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Lan\u00fas|Lan\u00fas]], which they lost 2-1.

Construction began on February 22, 2008, and on November 11, 2009, the stadium opened for a friendly match between Santos Laguna and [[Santos FC]] from the Brazilian [[S\u00e9rie A]]. The sellout crowd included Mexican president [[Felipe Calder\u00f3n]] and Brazilian legend [[Pel\u00e9]].

When Santos Laguna was founded in 1983, its crest was white with green stripes and letters (similar to that of [[Santos FC]]). In 1991, when [[Grupo Modelo]] bought the club, the crest became similar to the current one. In 1996, a star was added to the badge after winning their first title in the [[1996\u201397 Mexican Primera Divisi\u00f3n season#Tornero Invierno 1996|Invierno 1996]] tournament. After winning their second title in 2001, another star was added and switched to a darker shade of green with a black outline. As of 2012, the stars have been placed outside of the badge. In 2018, the club used a special badge, incorporating the number '35' for the club's 35th anniversary. A sixth star was added after winning the [[2017\u201318 Liga MX season#Torneo Clausura|Clausura 2018]] tournament.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clubsantos.mx/contenidos/escudo|title=Escudo|language=Spanish|accessdate=23 June 2018|trans-title=Badge|work=clubsantos.mx}}</ref>\n\n{{Gallery\n|align=center\n|File:Santos Laguna.png\n|Badge style in use since 2012.\n}}\n\n==={{anchor|Anthem}}Songs===\nIn 1991, when the club was in danger of relegation to the second division, Santos adopted their first team song: \"Es hora de ganar\", by [[Ricardo Serna]].

It later served as a base from which missionaries could accompany [[Charles the Great|Charlemagne]]'s armies in their political and military [[Saxon Wars|campaigns]] to fully conquer and convert pagan [[Old Saxony|Saxony]].\n\nThe initial grant for the abbey was signed by [[Carloman (mayor of the palace)|Carloman]], [[Mayor of the Palace]] in [[Austrasia]] (in office 741\u201347), the son of [[Charles Martel]]. The support of the Mayors of the Palace, and later of the early Pippinid and [[Carolingian]] rulers, was important to Boniface's success. Fulda also received support from many of the leading families of the Carolingian world. Sturm, whose tenure as abbot lasted from 747 until 779, was most likely related to the Agilolfing dukes of [[Bavaria]].\n\nFulda also received large and constant donations from the Etichonids, a leading family in [[Alsace]], and from the [[Conradines]], predecessors of the [[Salian]] [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s. Under Sturm, the donations Fulda received from these and other important families helped in the establishment of daughter-houses near Fulda.\n[[File:St Boniface - Baptising-Martyrdom - Sacramentary of Fulda - 11Century.jpg|thumb|St Boniface [[baptizing]] and undergoing [[martyr]]dom \u2013 from the Sacramentary of Fulda]]\n\n{{nowrap|After his martyrdom}} by the [[Frisians|Frisian]]s, the relics of Saint Boniface were brought back to Fulda. Because of the stature this afforded the monastery, the donations increased, and Fulda could establish daughter-houses further away, for example in [[Hamelin]]. Meanwhile, Saint [[Lullus]], successor of Boniface as [[archbishop of Mainz]], tried to absorb the abbey into his archbishopric, but failed. This was one reason that he founded [[Hersfeld Abbey]] \u2014 to limit the attempts of the enlargement of Fulda.\n[[File:Braun Fulda UBHD.jpg|thumb|Fulda in the 16th century]]\nBetween 790 and 819 the community rebuilt the main [[monastery]] church to more fittingly house the [[relic]]s.
