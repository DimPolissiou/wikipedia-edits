The penultimate episode of the series, it was released alongside seven others on [[Netflix]] on January 31, 2020, with [[Amy Winfrey]] directing and Alison Tafel writing. The episode places titular character [[BoJack Horseman (character)|BoJack Horseman]] in a vivid [[near-death experience]], in the form of a [[Party#Dinner party|dinner party]] and [[talent show]] featuring important figures from his life who have died. It was widely praised for its use of symbolism, animation style, and numerous callbacks to prior episodes.\n\n== Plot ==\nBojack and a child-age Sarah Lynn arrive at the front door of a large house. They are unceremoniously greeted by a young Beatrice Horseman, who invites them inside and asks for their help shooing a stray bird out of the house. Inside, Bojack finds a reprieved Herb Kazzaz, as well as Crackerjack Sugarman, Corduroy Jackson Jackson, and [[Zach Braff]] struggling to catch it. After successfully chasing it out, Bojack and the others are informed by Beatrice of the start of their scheduled dinner party, where each guest is served a meal reflective of a pivotal time in their life. As the guests discuss the best and worst parts of their lives, Sarah Lynn ages progressively, and a variety of existential perspectives are shared and debated. Throughout the meal, BoJack becomes increasingly bothered by a black tar-like liquid dripping onto him from the ceiling. A new arrival, introduced as BoJack\u2019s father Butterscotch, takes the physical appearance of BoJack\u2019s childhood idol, [[Secretariat (horse)|Secretariat]] and joins them at the table. Soon afterward, BoJack suddenly coughs up a large amount of the black liquid onto the dinner table which amuses his company. As the meal reaches its end, Beatrice invites the guests to a show in the next room. Bojack bids them all farewell, certain that he will imminently awake from the dream he believes he's in.\n\nNow alone at the dinner table, BoJack is surprised to find himself still there. In the next room, a dark theatre, Herb welcomes the party guests as he begins hosting a talent show in which they are each due to perform. Bojack notices a dark, ominous door located in the back area of the stage. Up first, Sarah Lynn performs a [[reprise]] of \u201c[[BoJack Horseman (season 5)|Don\u2019t Stop Dancing \u2018Til The Curtains Fall]]\u201d, followed by her plummet into the apparently bottomless, infinite blackness on the other side of the door. Following Corduroy\u2019s [[aerial silk]] act and similar disappearance into the darkness, an uneasy BoJack heads out to the balcony for a cigarette with Butterscotch/Secretariat, where the two manage to bond and form closure. Looking down, BoJack notices the silhouette of a horse floating in a swimming pool.\n\nBack in the theatre, Bojack begins to panic. He inadvertently pushes Zach Braff through the dark door as his [[roller skating]] routine begins. Starting to remember details of his bender from the previous episode, Bojack recalls that he went into his old house's swimming pool and called [[Diane Nguyen|Diane]]. Secretariat then performs a poem that expresses regret over his suicide, fearing the impending door as it moves incrementally closer, until his abrupt fall in ends his performance mid-sentence. Now highly disturbed, BoJack tries to escape. Unable to leave the theatre, Herb chimes that BoJack isn't dreaming, but mentally processing his own death, and that he should tranquilly accept his fate. Performing next is Beatrice, who [[Ribbon (rhythmic gymnastics)|ribbon dances]] to a musical number performed by Crackerjack on trumpet. Their performance concludes with a Crackerjack [[paratrooper]]-style dive through the door while tied to Beatrice, who gets consumed by the tar created from his exit.  With only two people left, Herb introduces Bojack as the next performer. In a final conversation, Herb muses of mortality, telling BoJack there is no \u201c[[Afterlife|other side]],\u201d before submerging into the blackness and leaving Bojack alone in the theater.\n\nStanding at the microphone, Bojack suddenly sprints from the stage in a desperate attempt to escape. The black tar has now begun to consume his surroundings, rapidly growing and in fast pursuit. As he runs back through the house, he feverishly searches for a phone. To his horror, he watches as the bird he expelled from the house earlier becomes swallowed by the tar. He successfully finds a [[landline]] in the kitchen and seemingly manages to reach Diane. As they talk, BoJack remembers that, in real life, after getting out of the pool to call her, his call actually went to [[voicemail]]. He then returned to the pool where he presumably [[Drowning|drowned]]. Finally succumbing to this, Bojack's projection of Diane\u2019s voice calmly agrees to stay on the phone with him as the tar engulfs his body.\n\nDuring the credits, rather than any music, a flatlining heart monitor is heard; however, partway through, it starts beeping normally.\n\n==Reception==\n\"The View From Halfway Down\" received widespread critical acclaim, and has been called one of the best episodes of the entire series.
