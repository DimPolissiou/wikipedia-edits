{"title_page": "King John and the Bishop", "text_new": "\"'''King John and the Bishop'''\" is an English [[folk-song]] dating back at least{{clarify|reason=at the earliest? at the latest?|date=August 2018}} to the 16th century. It is catalogued in [[Child Ballads]] as number 45 and [[Roud Folk Song Index]] 302.\n\n<!--The song recounts the poor relationship between [[John of England|King John]] and the archbishop of Canterbury, but is also an example of a [[riddle]]-song. -->\nIt tells how [[John of England|King John]], covetous of the bishop of Canterbury's wealth, compels him on pain of death to answer three impossible questions. The bishop's shepherd appears in disguise to substitute in his place, and answers the questions cleverly in [[riddle]] fashion, after which the appeased king rewards the shepherd and spares the bishop. Like the ballad, historical King John had a reputation of confiscating property from the clergy.<ref group=\"lower-alpha\">{{Harvnb|Philips|1723|loc=''Old Ballads'' II, pp.49-50}}, in commentary to the ballad: \"..when [King John] had taken a Mind to any Man's Estate, (especially a Churchman's, for those he frequently chased)\" it would have been out of character for him to as allow as much as three days to his victim, or so the anthologist has heard from skeptics who felt the ballad must have originally featured some other monarch.</ref>\n\nThe ballad is classified as [[Aarne-Thompson classification system|Aarne-Thompson]] folktale type \"AT 922\" of the shepherd substituting for the priest to answer the king's questions (For analogues, see [[#Parallels|Parallels]] below). Analogues are widespread, some of them being literary works dating to medieval times<!--REWRITTEN FROM:It is theoretically possible that it began as mythic folk tale, and was superimposed onto a story from history and then written as a song.-->.<!--CAN'T FIND THIS CLAIM: [[Francis James Child]] makes the comment that the roots of this ballad may be much older - perhaps going back to the sixth century, when riddling was a much stronger tradition in English poetry.-->\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[John of England|King John]] in the opening lines is described as a man who did much wrong and did little to uphold what was right. Enraged that the bishop (variant B, the abbot) of [[Canterbury]] maintained a household with many servants and riches paid by comfortable income, the king summons him to court, accuses him of treason, threatening him with beheading and the confiscation of income afterwards, unless the cleric can correctly answer three questions:\n\n*How long does it take to travel the whole world?\n*How much money am I worth?\n*What am I thinking?\n\nThe king sends the bishop off, allowing a thinking period of twenty days (B, three days).<ref group=\"lower-alpha\">In A he then rides to Oxford and Cambridge seeking learned men to give him the right answer, only to be derided. In B he rides straight to his country home.</ref> The distressed bishop returns to his shepherd (who in A is his own half-brother), and confides his dilemma. The shepherd says, \"Lend me your clothes, I will deliver the correct answers for you\". The disguised shepherd then meets King John. His answers are:\n\n*A twenty-four-hour day. If you rise in the morning and follow the sun's movement the whole day long, until you wait for the sun to come up in the same place the following morning. Then you'll have traveled the world around. \n*[[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] sold [[Christ]] for [[thirty pieces of silver]]. You are worth almost as much as Christ. You are worth 29 pieces of silver.\n*You are thinking I am the bishop of Canterbury. In fact I am a shepherd in disguise.\n\nImpressed by the clever response, the king offers the appointment of the shepherd as bishop. This the shepherd diffidently declines, at which the king awards him a monetary pension, and pardons the bishop as well.<ref group=\"lower-alpha\">In B, the pension is four pounds per week, which calculates to a larger sum. In A, the king offers 300 pounds a year, the brother offers 50 more, and the shepherd declares he no longer will tolerate keeping sheep for his brother.</ref>\n\n==Commentary==\nOn the one hand the song is an oblique reference to the poor relationship between King John and the archbishop of Canterbury. On the other hand, it can be enjoyed as a clever [[riddle]]-song. <!--DUBIOUS OR MISWORDED: [[Francis James Child]] makes the comment that the roots of this ballad may be much older - perhaps going back to the sixth century, when riddling was a much stronger tradition in English poetry. (see [[Exeter Book]] and [[Anglo-Saxon literature]]). -->\n\n===The ''Derry down'' refrain===\nThe \"Derry down\" chorus belongs very much to the sixteenth century, and occurs in many ballads.<ref>\"Derry down\" occurs in ''The Huntsman's Delight; or The Forester's Pleasure'', ''Roxburghe ballads'' Vol. VII, p.557- with the lines \"Derry derry down/Among the leaves so green O\" is referred to by the title \"The Keeper\" by some sources.</ref> William Chappell ventured to guess that the ballad entitled \"A defence for [[wikt:milkmaids|Mylkemaydes]] against the terme of [[wikt:malkin|Mawken]]\" (before 1563-4), with the refrain \"Down, a-downe, &c.\" might have been set to the same tune.<!--RS BUT OFF TOPIC?--><!--UNRELIABLE SOURCE ELABORATES: A website dedicated to the printed books of William Chappell (\"Popular music of Olden Time\") suggests that milkmaids frequently sang as they went milking. The explanation of the \"Derry down, down hey, derry down\" might be the milkmaids pulling the cow teats down. (see [http://www.traditionalmusic.co.uk/popular-music-olden-times-1/popular-music-of-olden-times1%20-%200449.htm Olden Times]). However no other site endorses this theory.-->\n\n===Historical Background===\nKing John's father, [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], indirectly made a martyr of [[Thomas Becket|Thomas a Beckett]]. Like his father, John had a conflict with the Catholic Church, and refused to ratify the Pope's choice for the post of the Archbishop of Canterbury, Stephen Langton. The Pope responded with bureaucratic constraints, and in retaliation John removed from office several bishops.\n\nThe idea that a shepherd, or the lesser brother of a bishop, could out-wit a king, is quite subversive. Most of the [[Robin Hood]] ballads have the same characteristics, except that the sheriff is in place of the king. King John is closely associated with Robin Hood, so perhaps this is not a coincidence.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThere is also the suggestion that the educated bishop (or abbot) is not as wise as the uneducated brother (or shepherd) - implying there is a \"native wit\" that is more valuable than school-book wisdom.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe song has been found in England, Scotland, and the United States.<ref name=\"waltz\">{{cite web|author1=Robert B.

It was printed with this title in 1776 in [[John Hawkins (author)|Hawkins']] ''History of Music''. It also appears as \"Shakinge of the Sheetes\" in William Ballet's lute manuscript. A tune of this title appears in the [[Stationers' Register]] of 1568/9. The title is also mentioned in a play of 1560. The words that accompany this tune are a witty comparison between the bedsheets (a dance of life) and the winding sheets (the dance of death). \"Shaking of the sheets\" is sung by [[Steeleye Span]] on the album ''[[Tempted and Tried]]'' and by [[The City Waites]] on ''Ghosts, Witches and Demons'' (1995).\n\n[[John Playford]]'s 1650 manual ''[[The Dancing Master]]'' gives the tune as \"The Night Peece\". Only with difficulty can the words of the Percy manuscript text, be made to fit this version of the tune. The tune also goes by the name \"Derry Down\". \"The Night Peece\" is the name of a dance in Playford's books.\n\n==Musical adaptations==\nIn 1891 Charles Josph Frost wrote a cantata \"King John and the Abbot of Canterbury\" based on the ballad.\n\n===Other songs with the same tune===\n[[Thomas Baker (attorney)|Thomas Baker]]'s 1703 play ''Tunbridge-Walks; or, The Yeoman of Kent'' contains the ballad, but only the opening verses. This was followed by instances of the tune being used on stage several times over the next 50 years, with different words.

It is catalogued in [[Child Ballads]] as number 45 and [[Roud Folk Song Index]] 302.\n\n<!--The song recounts the poor relationship between [[John of England|King John]] and the archbishop of Canterbury, but is also an example of a [[riddle]]-song. -->\nIt tells how [[John of England|King John]], covetous of the bishop of Canterbury's wealth, compels him on pain of death to answer three impossible questions. The bishop's shepherd appears in disguise to substitute in his place, and answers the questions cleverly in [[riddle]] fashion, after which the appeased king rewards the shepherd and spares the bishop. Like the ballad, historical King John had a reputation of confiscating property from the clergy.<ref group=\"lower-alpha\">{{Harvnb|Philips|1723|loc=''Old Ballads'' II, pp.49-50}}, in commentary to the ballad: \"..when [King John] had taken a Mind to any Man's Estate, (especially a Churchman's, for those he frequently chased)\" it would have been out of character for him to as allow as much as three days to his victim, or so the anthologist has heard from skeptics who felt the ballad must have originally featured some other monarch.</ref>\n\nThe ballad is classified as [[Aarne-Thompson classification system|Aarne-Thompson]] folktale type \"AT 922\" of the shepherd substituting for the priest to answer the king's questions (For analogues, see [[#Parallels|Parallels]] below). Analogues are widespread, some of them being literary works dating to medieval times<!--REWRITTEN FROM:It is theoretically possible that it began as mythic folk tale, and was superimposed onto a story from history and then written as a song.-->.<!--CAN'T FIND THIS CLAIM: [[Francis James Child]] makes the comment that the roots of this ballad may be much older - perhaps going back to the sixth century, when riddling was a much stronger tradition in English poetry.-->\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[John of England|King John]] in the opening lines is described as a man did much wrong and did little to uphold what was right. Enraged that the bishop (variant B, the abbot) of [[Canterbury]] maintained a household with many servants and riches paid by comfortable income, the king summons him to court, accuses him of treason, threatening him with beheading and the confiscation of income afterwards, unless the cleric can correctly answer three questions:\n\n*How long does it take to travel the whole world?\n*How much money am I worth?\n*What am I thinking?\n\nThe king sends the bishop off, allowing a thinking period of twenty days (B, three days).<ref group=\"lower-alpha\">In A he then rides to Oxford and Cambridge seeking learned men to give him the right answer, only to be derided. In B he rides straight to his country home.</ref> The distressed bishop returns to his shepherd (who in A is his own half-brother), and confides his dilemma. The shepherd says, \"Lend me your clothes, I will deliver the correct answers for you\". The disguised shepherd then meets King John. His answers are:\n\n*A twenty-four-hour day. If you rise in the morning and follow the sun's movement the whole day long, until you wait for the sun to come up in the same place the following morning. Then you'll have traveled the world around. \n*[[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] sold [[Christ]] for [[thirty pieces of silver]]. You are worth almost as much as Christ. You are worth 29 pieces of silver.\n*You are thinking I am the bishop of Canterbury. In fact I am a shepherd in disguise.\n\nImpressed by the clever response, the king offers the appointment of the shepherd as bishop. This the shepherd diffidently declines, at which the king awards him a monetary pension, and pardons the bishop as well.<ref group=\"lower-alpha\">In B, the pension is four pounds per week, which calculates to a larger sum. In A, the king offers 300 pounds a year, the brother offers 50 more, and the shepherd declares he no longer will tolerate keeping sheep for his brother.</ref>\n\n==Commentary==\nOn the one hand the song is an oblique reference to the poor relationship between King John and the archbishop of Canterbury. On the other hand, it can be enjoyed as a clever [[riddle]]-song. <!--DUBIOUS OR MISWORDED: [[Francis James Child]] makes the comment that the roots of this ballad may be much older - perhaps going back to the sixth century, when riddling was a much stronger tradition in English poetry. (see [[Exeter Book]] and [[Anglo-Saxon literature]]). -->\n\n===The ''Derry down'' refrain===\nThe \"Derry down\" chorus belongs very much to the sixteenth century, and occurs in many ballads.<ref>\"Derry down\" occurs in ''The Huntsman's Delight; or The Forester's Pleasure'', ''Roxburghe ballads'' Vol. VII, p.557- with the lines \"Derry derry down/Among the leaves so green O\" is referred to by the title \"The Keeper\" by some sources.</ref> William Chappell ventured to guess that the ballad entitled \"A defence for [[wikt:milkmaids|Mylkemaydes]] against the terme of [[wikt:malkin|Mawken]]\" (before 1563-4), with the refrain \"Down, a-downe, &c.\" might have been set to the same tune.<!--RS BUT OFF TOPIC?--><!--UNRELIABLE SOURCE ELABORATES: A website dedicated to the printed books of William Chappell (\"Popular music of Olden Time\") suggests that milkmaids frequently sang as they went milking. The explanation of the \"Derry down, down hey, derry down\" might be the milkmaids pulling the cow teats down. (see [http://www.traditionalmusic.co.uk/popular-music-olden-times-1/popular-music-of-olden-times1%20-%200449.htm Olden Times]). However no other site endorses this theory.-->\n\n===Historical Background===\nKing John's father, [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], indirectly made a martyr of [[Thomas Becket|Thomas a Beckett]]. Like his father, John had a conflict with the Catholic Church, and refused to ratify the Pope's choice for the post of the Archbishop of Canterbury, Stephen Langton. The Pope responded with bureaucratic constraints, and in retaliation John removed from office several bishops.\n\nThe idea that a shepherd, or the lesser brother of a bishop, could out-wit a king, is quite subversive. Most of the [[Robin Hood]] ballads have the same characteristics, except that the sheriff is in place of the king. King John is closely associated with Robin Hood, so perhaps this is not a coincidence.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThere is also the suggestion that the educated bishop (or abbot) is not as wise as the uneducated brother (or shepherd) - implying there is a \"native wit\" that is more valuable than school-book wisdom.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe song has been found in England, Scotland, and the United States.<ref name=\"waltz\">{{cite web|author1=Robert B.

The tale appears in English under the title \"The Priest and the Clerk\" (Dasent tr.) or \"The Parson and The Sexton\" (Patrick Shaw Iversen tr.). In the folktale, a priest who is in the habit of shouting everyone else to swerve when he is travelling the road gets in trouble by behaving the same way before the king, who threatens to defrock him if he is not competent to answer them. The priest condescendingly says a fool can stump ten wise men with questions, and refuses to the king, so his clerk makes the appearance. When asked \"How far the east is from west?\" the clerk replies \"A day's journey,\" for that is the course the sun takes between rising and setting. The king's worth? -- No more than 29 silver pieces (''{{linktext|S\u00f8lv|penge}}'') since Christ was worth [[thirty pieces of silver]]. The king's thought? -- that the priest stands before him, but he must stand corrected for he is the clerk. By the king's decree, the clerk was appointed priest and the priest demoted to clerk.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last1=Asbj\u00f8rnsen|editor-first1=Peter Christen|editor-last2=Moe|editor-first2=J\u00f8rgen|chapter=86.

It was printed with this title in 1776 in [[John Hawkins (author)|Hawkins']] ''History of Music''. It also appears as \"Shakinge of the Sheetes\" in William Ballet's lute manuscript. A tune of this title appears in the [[Stationers' Register]] of 1568/9. The title is also mentioned in a play of 1560. The words that accompany this tune are a witty comparison between the bedsheets (a dance of life) and the winding sheets (the dance of death). \"Shaking of the sheets\" is sung by [[Steeleye Span]] on the album ''[[Tempted and Tried]]'' and by [[The City Waites]] on ''Ghosts, Witches and Demons'' (1995).\n\n[[John Playford]]'s 1650 manual ''[[The Dancing Master]]'' gives the tune as \"The Night Peece\". Only with difficulty can the words of the Percy manuscript text, be made to fit this version of the tune. The tune also goes by the name \"Derry Down\". \"The Night Peece\" is the name of a dance in Playford's books.\n\n==Musical adaptations==\nIn 1891 Charles Josph Frost wrote a cantata \"King John and the Abbot of Canterbury\" based on the ballad.\n\n===Other songs with the same tune===\n[[Thomas Baker (attorney)|Thomas Baker]]'s 1703 play ''Tunbridge-Walks; or, The Yeoman of Kent'' contains the ballad, but only the opening verses.

Clines can show smooth, continuous gradation in a character, or they may show more abrupt changes in the trait from one geographic region to the next.<ref name=\"Endler\" />\n\nA cline refers to a spatial gradient in a specific, singular trait, rather than a gradient in a [[population]] as a whole.<ref name= \"Huxley biography\">{{cite book|last1=Dronamraju|first1=Krishna R.|last2=Needham|first2=Joseph|title=If I Am To Be Remembered: Correspondence Of Julian Huxley|date=1993|publisher=World Scientific|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xrLsCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT195&lpg=PT195&dq=continuous+discontinuous+clines#v=onepage&q=continuous%20discontinuous%20clines&f=false|isbn=9789814505192}}</ref> A single population can therefore theoretically have as many clines as it has traits.<ref name=\"Forest genetics\" /> Additionally, Huxley recognised that these multiple independent clines may not act in concordance with each other. For example, it has been observed that in Australia, birds generally become smaller the further towards the north of the country they are found. In contrast, the intensity of their plumage colouration follows a different geographical trajectory, being most vibrant where humidity is highest and becoming less vibrant further into the arid centre of the country.<ref name= \"Mayr1963\">{{cite book|last1=Mayr|first1=Ernst|title=Populations, species, and evolution: an abridgment of Animal species and evolution|date=1963|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|url=https://archive.org/details/animalspeciesevo00mayr|url-access=registration|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref>  \nBecause of this, clines were defined by Huxley as being an \u201cauxiliary taxonomic principle\u201d; that is, clinal variation in a species is not awarded taxonomic recognition in the way [[subspecies]] or [[species]] are.<ref name=\"Huxley\" />\n\nWhile the terms \u201c[[ecotype]]\u201d and \u201ccline\u201d are sometimes used interchangeably, they do in fact differ in that \u201cecotype\u201d refers to a population which differs from other populations in a number of characters, rather than the single character that varies amongst populations in a cline.<ref name=\"Forest genetics\">{{cite book|last1=White|first1=Timothy L.|last2=Adams|first2=W.

This diversifying force is countered by gene flow, which has a homogenising effect on populations and prevents [[speciation]] through causing [[genetic admixture]] and blurring any distinct genetic boundaries.<ref name=\"Mayr1963\" />\n\n===Development of clines===\nClines are generally thought to arise under one of two conditions: \u201cprimary differentiation\u201d (also known as \"primary contact\" or \"primary intergradation\" ), or \u201csecondary contact\u201d (also known as \"secondary introgression\", or \"secondary intergradation\").<ref name=\"Endler\" /><ref name=\"Mayr1942\" /><ref name=\"Joseph\" />\n\n====Primary differentiation====\n[[File:Final Primary Differentiation.svg|thumb|upright=1|Primary differentiation is demonstrated using the peppered moth as an example, with a change in an environmental variable such as sooty coverage of trees imposing a selective pressure on a previously uniformly coloured moth population. This causes the frequency of melanic morphs to increase the more soot there is on vegetation.]]\nClines produced through this way are generated by spatial heterogeneity in environmental conditions. The mechanism of selection acting upon organisms is therefore external. Species ranges frequently span environmental gradients (e.g. humidity, rainfall, temperature, or day length) and, according to natural selection, different environments will favour different [[genotype]]s or [[phenotype]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Darwin|first1=Charles R.|title=On the Origin of Species by means of natural selection, or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life|url=https://archive.org/details/onoriginofspec00darw|date=1859|publisher=London: John Murray}}</ref> In this way, when previously genetically or phenotypically uniform populations spread into novel environments, they will evolve to be uniquely adapted to the local environment, in the process potentially creating a gradient in a genotypic or phenotypic trait.\n\nSuch clines in characters can not be maintained through selection alone if lots of gene flow occurred between populations, as this would tend to swamp out the effects of local adaptation.

During the 19th century, when the industrial sector gained traction, coal emissions blackened vegetation across northwest England and parts of northern Wales. As a result of this, lighter [[morph (zoology)|morph]]s of the moth were more visible to predators against the blackened tree trunks and were therefore more heavily predated relative to the darker morphs. Consequently, the frequency of the more [[Crypsis|cryptic]] melanic morph of the peppered moth increased drastically in northern England. This cline in morph colour, from a dominance of lighter morphs in the west of England (which did not suffer as heavily from pollution), to the higher frequency of melanic forms in the north, has slowly been degrading since limitations to sooty emissions were introduced in the 1960s.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Saccheri|first1=Illik J.|last2=Rousset|first2=Francois|last3=Watts|first3=Phillip C.|last4=Brakefield|first4=Paul M.|last5=Cook|first5=Laurence M.|title=Selection and gene flow on a diminishing cline of melanic peppered moths|journal=PNAS|date=2008|volume=105|issue=42|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n====Secondary contact====\n{{main|Secondary contact}}\n[[File:Secondary Introgression.svg|thumb|upright=1|Secondary contact between two previously isolated populations.

This means that the fitness of individuals is independent of the external environment, and selection is instead dependent on the genome of the individual. Intrinsic, or endogenous, selection can give rise to clines in characters through a variety of mechanisms. One way it may act is through [[heterozygote]] disadvantage, in which intermediate genotypes have a lower relative fitness than either homozygote genotypes. Because of this disadvantage, one allele will tend to become fixed in a given population, such that populations will consist largely of either ''AA'' ([[homozygote|homozygous]] dominant) or ''aa'' (homozygous recessive) individuals.<ref name=\"Bazykin1969\">{{cite journal|last1=Bazykin|first1=A.

Characters that could be maintained by such frequency-dependent selective pressures include warning signals ([[aposematism]]). For example, aposematic signals in ''[[Heliconius]]'' butterflies sometimes display steep clines between populations, which are maintained through [[Frequency-dependent selection#Positive|positive frequency dependence]].<ref name=\"Richard1993\" /> This is because heterozygosity, [[mutation]]s and [[Genetic recombination|recombination]] can all produce patterns that deviate from those well-established signals which mark prey as being unpalatable. These individuals are then predated more heavily relative to their counterparts with \"normal\" markings (i.e. selected against), creating populations dominated by a particular  pattern of warning signal. As with heterozygote disadvantage, when these populations join, a narrow cline of intermediate individuals could be produced, maintained by gene flow counteracting selection.<ref name=\"Richard1993\" /><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mallet|first1=James|last2=Barton|first2=Nicholas H.|title=Strong natural selection in a warning-colour hybrid zone|journal=Evolution|date=1989|volume=43|issue=2|jstor=2409217|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nSecondary contact  could lead to a cline with a steep gradient if heterozygote disadvantage or frequency-dependent selection exists, as intermediates are heavily selected against. Alternatively, steep clines could exist because the populations have only recently established secondary contact, and the character in the original allopatric populations had a large degree of differentiation. As genetic admixture between the population increases with time however, the steepness of the cline is likely to decrease as the difference in character is eroded. However, if the character in the original allopatric populations was not very differentiated to begin with, the cline between the populations need not display a very steep gradient.<ref name=\"Endler\" /> Because both primary differentiation and secondary contact can therefore give rise to similar or identical clinal patterns (e.g. gently sloping clines), distinguishing which of these two processes is responsible for generating a cline is difficult and often impossible.<ref name=\"Endler\" /> However, in some circumstances a cline and a geographic variable (such as humidity) may be very tightly linked, with a change in one corresponding closely to a change in the other. In such cases it may be tentatively concluded that the cline is generated by primary differentiation and therefore moulded by environmental selective pressures.<ref name=\"Joseph\" />\n\n====No selection (drift/migration balance)====\nWhile selection can therefore clearly play a key role in creating clines, it is theoretically feasible that they might be generated by [[genetic drift]] alone. It is unlikely that large-scale clines in genotype or phenotype frequency will be produced solely by drift. However, across smaller geographical scales and in smaller populations, drift could produce temporary clines.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Futuyma|first1=Douglas|title=Evolution|url=https://archive.org/details/evolution0000futu|url-access=registration|date=2005|publisher=Sinauer Associates}}</ref> The fact that drift is a weak force upholding the cline however means that clines produced this way are often random (i.e. uncorrelated with environmental variables) and subject to breakdown or reversal over time.<ref name=\"Endler\" /> Such clines are therefore unstable and sometimes called \u201ctransient clines\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Polechov\u00e1|first1=Jitka|last2=Barton|first2=Nick|title=Genetic Drift Widens the Expected Cline but Narrows the Expected Cline Width|journal=Genetics|date=September 2011|volume=189|issue=1|pages=227\u2013235|doi=10.1534/genetics.111.129817|pmid=21705747|pmc=3176109}}</ref>\n\n==Clinal structure and terminology==\n[[File:Character-Cline Diagram.svg|thumb|upright=1|Clinal characters change from one end of the geographic range to another.

However, it may also reflect a sudden environmental change or boundary.

In this way, these clines are both biologically (no clear subgroups) and geographically (contiguous distribution) continuous. \nContinuous clines can be further sub-divided into smooth and stepped clines. \n*Continuous smooth clines are characterised by the lack of any abrupt changes or delineation in the genetic or phenotypic trait across the cline, instead displaying a smooth gradation throughout. Huxley recognised that this type of cline, with its uniform slope throughout, was unlikely to be common. \n*Continuous stepped clines consist of an overall shallow cline, interspersed by sections of much steeper slope. The shallow slope represents the populations, and the shorter, steeper sections the larger change in character between populations.<ref name=\"hedrick\">{{cite book|last1=Hedrick|first1=Philip|title=Genetics of Populations|date=2011|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning}}</ref> Stepped clines can be further subdivided into horizontally stepped clines, and obliquely stepped clines. \n**Horizontally stepped clines show no intra-population variation or gradation in the character, therefore displaying a horizontal gradient. These uniform populations are connected by steeper sections of the cline, characterised by larger changes in the form of the character. However, because in continuous clines all populations exchange genetic material, the intergradation zone between the groups can never have a vertical slope.<ref name=\"hedrick\" /> \n**In obliquely stepped clines, conversely, each population also demonstrates a cline in the character, albeit of a shallower slope than the clines connecting the populations together. Huxley compared obliquely stepped clines to looking like a \u201cstepped ramp\u201d, rather than taking on the formation of a staircase as in the case of horizontally stepped clines.<ref name=\"Huxley biography\" />\n\n===Discontinuous stepped clines===\nUnlike in continuous clines, in discontinuous clines the populations of species are allopatric, meaning there is very little or no gene flow amongst populations. The genetic or phenotypic trait in question always shows a steeper gradient between groups than within groups, as in continuous clines. Discontinuous clines follow the same principles as continuous clines by displaying either\n*Horizontally stepped clines, where intra-group variation is very small or non-existent and the geographic space separating groups shows a sharp change in character\n*Obliquely stepped clines, where there is some intra-group gradation, but this is less than the gradation in the character between populations<ref name=\"Huxley\" />\n\n==Clines and speciation==\n[[File:Parapatric Speciation Schematic.svg|thumb|upright=1|[[Parapatric speciation]]]]\nIt was originally assumed that geographic isolation was a necessary precursor to speciation ([[allopatric speciation]]).<ref name=\"Mayr1942\">{{cite book|last1=Mayr|first1=Ernst|title=Systematics and the Origin of Species from the viewpoint of a zoologist|url=https://archive.org/details/systematicsorigi0000mayr_p8z7|url-access=registration|date=1942|publisher=Columbia University Press}}</ref> The possibility that clines may be a precursor to speciation was therefore ignored, as they were assumed to be evidence of the fact that in contiguous populations gene flow was too strong a force of homogenisation, and selection too weak a force of differentiation, for speciation to take place.<ref name=\"Endler\" /> However, the existence of particular types of clines, such as [[ring species]], in which populations did not differentiate in allopatry but the terminal ends of the cline nonetheless do not interbreed, cast into doubt whether complete geographical isolation of populations is an absolute requirement for speciation.\n\nBecause clines can exist in populations connected by some degree of gene flow, the generation of new species from a previously clinal population is termed [[parapatric speciation]]. Both extrinsic and intrinsic selection can serve to generate varying degrees of [[reproductive isolation]] and thereby instigate the process of [[speciation]]. For example, through environmental selection acting on populations and favouring particular allele frequencies, large genetic differences between populations may accumulate (this would be reflected in clinal structure by the presence of numerous very steep clines). If the local genetic differences are great enough, it may lead unfavourable combinations of genotypes and therefore to hybrids being at a decreased fitness relative to the parental lines. When this hybrid disadvantage is great enough, natural selection will select for [[Reproductive isolation#Pre-zygotic isolation|pre-zygotic]] traits in the homozygous parental lines that reduce the likelihood of disadvantageous hybridisation - in other words, natural selection will favour traits that promote assortative mating in the parental lines.<ref name=\"EoE\">{{cite book|last1=Jorgensen|first1=Sven|last2=Fath|first2=Brian|title=Encyclopaedia of Ecology|date=2014|publisher=Newnes}}</ref> This is known as [[Reinforcement (speciation)|reinforcement]] and plays an important role in parapatric and [[sympatric speciation]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Coyne|first1=Jerry A.|last2=Orr|first2=H.

Character states can however additionally be represented using isophenes, defined by Ernst Mayr as \u201clines of equal expression of a clinally varying character\u201d.<ref name=\"Mayr1963\" /> In other words, areas on maps that demonstrate the same biological phenomenon or character will be connected by something that resembles a contour line. When mapping clines therefore, which follow a character gradation from one extreme to the other, isophenes will transect clinal lines at a right angle.\n\n==Examples of clines==\n[[File:Northern red fox & southern desert red fox.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Bergmann's Rule demonstrated showing the difference in size between a larger northern fox, whose range spans colder regions, and a smaller desert fox, whose range is primarily in hot regions.]]\nAlthough the term \u201ccline\u201d was first officially coined by Huxley in 1938, gradients and geographic variations in the character states of species have been observed for centuries. Indeed, some gradations have been considered so ubiquitous that they have been labelled [[Biological rules|ecological \u201crules\u201d]]. One commonly cited example of a gradient in morphology is [[Gloger's rule|Gloger's Rule]], named after [[C. L. Gloger|Constantin Gloger]], who observed in 1833 that environmental factors and the pigmentation of avian [[plumage]] tend to covary with each other, such that birds found in arid areas near the Equator tend to be much darker than those in less arid areas closer to the Poles.  Since then, this rule has been extended to include many other animals, including flies, butterflies, and wolves.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Huggett|first1=Richard J.|title=Fundamentals of Biogeography|date=2004|publisher=Psychology Press}}</ref>\n\nOther ecogeographical rules include [[Bergmann\u2019s rule|Bergmann's Rule]], coined by [[Carl Bergmann (anatomist)|Carl Bergmann]] in 1857, which states that [[Homeothermy|homeotherms]] closer to the Equator tend to be smaller than their more northerly or southerly conspecifics.<ref name=\"Wool\" /> One of the proposed reasons for this cline is that larger animals have a relatively smaller surface area to volume ratio and therefore improved heat conservancy \u2013 an important advantage in cold climates.<ref name=\"Wool\">{{cite book|last1=Wool|first1=David|title=The Driving Forces of Evolution: Genetic Processes in Populations|date=2006|publisher=CRC Press|page=163|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ydWuuBw6xeYC&dq=huxley+1942+cline|isbn=9781578084456}}</ref> The role of the environment in imposing a selective pressure and producing this cline has been heavily implicated due to the fact that Bergmann\u2019s Rule has been observed across many independent lineages of species and continents.

The populations elsewhere along the cline interbreed with their geographically adjacent populations as in a standard cline. In the case of ''[[Larus]]'' gulls, the habitats of the end populations even overlap, which introduces questions as to what constitutes a species: nowhere along the cline can a line be drawn between the populations, but they are unable to interbreed.\n\nIn humans, clines in the frequency of blood types has allowed scientists to infer past population migrations. For example, the Type B blood group reaches its highest frequency in Asia, but become less frequent further west. From this, it has been possible to infer that some Asian populations migrated towards Europe around 2,000 years ago, causing genetic admixture in an [[isolation by distance]] model. In contrast to this cline, blood Type A shows the reverse pattern, reaching its highest frequency in Europe and declining in frequency towards Asia.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Birx|first1=H.

This diversifying force is countered by gene flow, which has a homogenising effect on populations and prevents [[speciation]] through causing [[genetic admixture]] and blurring any distinct genetic boundaries.<ref name=\"Mayr1963\" />\n\n===Development of clines===\nClines are generally thought to arise under one of two conditions: \u201cprimary differentiation\u201d (also known as \"primary contact\" or \"primary intergradation\" ), or \u201csecondary contact\u201d (also known as \"secondary introgression\", or \"secondary intergradation\").<ref name=\"Endler\" /><ref name=\"Mayr1942\" /><ref name=\"Joseph\" />\n\n====Primary differentiation====\n[[File:Final Primary Differentiation.svg|thumb|upright=1|Primary differentiation is demonstrated using the peppered moth as an example, with a change in an environmental variable such as sooty coverage of trees imposing a selective pressure on a previously uniformly coloured moth population.

The mechanism of selection acting upon organisms is therefore external. Species ranges frequently span environmental gradients (e.g. humidity, rainfall, temperature, or day length) and, according to natural selection, different environments will favour different [[genotype]]s or [[phenotype]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Darwin|first1=Charles R.|title=On the Origin of Species by means of natural selection, or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life|url=https://archive.org/details/onoriginofspec00darw|date=1859|publisher=London: John Murray}}</ref> In this way, when previously genetically or phenotypically uniform populations spread into novel environments, they will evolve to be uniquely adapted to the local environment, in the process potentially creating a gradient in a genotypic or phenotypic trait.\n\nSuch clines in characters can not be maintained through selection alone if lots of gene flow occurred between populations, as this would tend to swamp out the effects of local adaptation. However, because species usually tend to have a limited dispersal range (e.g. in an [[isolation by distance]] model), restricted gene flow can serve as a type of barrier which encourages geographic differentiation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wright|first1=Sewall|title=Isolation by Distance|journal=Genetics|date=1943|volume=28|issue=2|pages=114\u2013138|pmc=1209196|pmid=17247074}}</ref> However, some degree of migration is often required to maintain a cline; without it, [[speciation]] is likely to eventually occur, as local adaptation can cause reproductive isolation between populations.<ref name=\"Endler\" />\n\nA classic example of the role of environmental gradients in creating clines is that of the peppered moth, [[Peppered moth|''Biston betularia'']], in the UK. During the 19th century, when the industrial sector gained traction, coal emissions blackened vegetation across northwest England and parts of northern Wales. As a result of this, lighter [[morph (zoology)|morph]]s of the moth were more visible to predators against the blackened tree trunks and were therefore more heavily predated relative to the darker morphs. Consequently, the frequency of the more [[Crypsis|cryptic]] melanic morph of the peppered moth increased drastically in northern England. This cline in morph colour, from a dominance of lighter morphs in the west of England (which did not suffer as heavily from pollution), to the higher frequency of melanic forms in the north, has slowly been degrading since limitations to sooty emissions were introduced in the 1960s.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Saccheri|first1=Illik J.|last2=Rousset|first2=Francois|last3=Watts|first3=Phillip C.|last4=Brakefield|first4=Paul M.|last5=Cook|first5=Laurence M.|title=Selection and gene flow on a diminishing cline of melanic peppered moths|journal=PNAS|date=2008|volume=105|issue=42|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n====Secondary contact====\n{{main|Secondary contact}}\n[[File:Secondary Introgression.svg|thumb|upright=1|Secondary contact between two previously isolated populations.

This secondary contact scenario may occur, for example, when climatic conditions change, allowing the ranges of populations to expand and meet.<ref name=\"Mayr1942\" /> Because over time the effect of gene flow will tend to eventually swamp out any regional differences and cause one large homogenous population, for a stable cline to be maintained when two populations join there must usually be a selective pressure maintaining a degree of differentiation between the two populations.<ref name=\"Endler\" />\n\nThe mechanism of selection maintaining the clines in this scenario is often intrinsic. This means that the fitness of individuals is independent of the external environment, and selection is instead dependent on the genome of the individual. Intrinsic, or endogenous, selection can give rise to clines in characters through a variety of mechanisms. One way it may act is through [[heterozygote]] disadvantage, in which intermediate genotypes have a lower relative fitness than either homozygote genotypes. Because of this disadvantage, one allele will tend to become fixed in a given population, such that populations will consist largely of either ''AA'' ([[homozygote|homozygous]] dominant) or ''aa'' (homozygous recessive) individuals.<ref name=\"Bazykin1969\">{{cite journal|last1=Bazykin|first1=A.

Characters that could be maintained by such frequency-dependent selective pressures include warning signals ([[aposematism]]). For example, aposematic signals in ''[[Heliconius]]'' butterflies sometimes display steep clines between populations, which are maintained through [[Frequency-dependent selection#Positive|positive frequency dependence]].<ref name=\"Richard1993\" /> This is because heterozygosity, [[mutation]]s and [[Genetic recombination|recombination]] can all produce patterns that deviate from those well-established signals which mark prey as being unpalatable. These individuals are then predated more heavily relative to their counterparts with \"normal\" markings (i.e. selected against), creating populations dominated by a particular  pattern of warning signal. As with heterozygote disadvantage, when these populations join, a narrow cline of intermediate individuals could be produced, maintained by gene flow counteracting selection.<ref name=\"Richard1993\" /><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mallet|first1=James|last2=Barton|first2=Nicholas H.|title=Strong natural selection in a warning-colour hybrid zone|journal=Evolution|date=1989|volume=43|issue=2|jstor=2409217|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nSecondary contact  could lead to a cline with a steep gradient if heterozygote disadvantage or frequency-dependent selection exists, as intermediates are heavily selected against. Alternatively, steep clines could exist because the populations have only recently established secondary contact, and the character in the original allopatric populations had a large degree of differentiation. As genetic admixture between the population increases with time however, the steepness of the cline is likely to decrease as the difference in character is eroded. However, if the character in the original allopatric populations was not very differentiated to begin with, the cline between the populations need not display a very steep gradient.<ref name=\"Endler\" /> Because both primary differentiation and secondary contact can therefore give rise to similar or identical clinal patterns (e.g. gently sloping clines), distinguishing which of these two processes is responsible for generating a cline is difficult and often impossible.<ref name=\"Endler\" /> However, in some circumstances a cline and a geographic variable (such as humidity) may be very tightly linked, with a change in one corresponding closely to a change in the other. In such cases it may be tentatively concluded that the cline is generated by primary differentiation and therefore moulded by environmental selective pressures.<ref name=\"Joseph\" />\n\n====No selection (drift/migration balance)====\nWhile selection can therefore clearly play a key role in creating clines, it is theoretically feasible that they might be generated by [[genetic drift]] alone. It is unlikely that large-scale clines in genotype or phenotype frequency will be produced solely by drift. However, across smaller geographical scales and in smaller populations, drift could produce temporary clines.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Futuyma|first1=Douglas|title=Evolution|url=https://archive.org/details/evolution0000futu|url-access=registration|date=2005|publisher=Sinauer Associates}}</ref> The fact that drift is a weak force upholding the cline however means that clines produced this way are often random (i.e. uncorrelated with environmental variables) and subject to breakdown or reversal over time.<ref name=\"Endler\" /> Such clines are therefore unstable and sometimes called \u201ctransient clines\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Polechov\u00e1|first1=Jitka|last2=Barton|first2=Nick|title=Genetic Drift Widens the Expected Cline but Narrows the Expected Cline Width|journal=Genetics|date=September 2011|volume=189|issue=1|pages=227\u2013235|doi=10.1534/genetics.111.129817|pmid=21705747|pmc=3176109}}</ref>\n\n==Clinal structure and terminology==\n[[File:Character-Cline Diagram.svg|thumb|upright=1|Clinal characters change from one end of the geographic range to another.

It has been previously outlined that such steep clines may be the result of two previously allopatric populations with a large degree of difference in the trait having only recently established gene flow, or where there is strong selection against hybrids. However, it may also reflect a sudden environmental change or boundary. Examples of rapidly changing environmental boundaries like this include abrupt changes in the heavy metal content of soils, and the consequent narrow clines produced between populations of ''[[Agrostis]]'' that are either adapted to these soils with high metal content, or adapted to \"normal\" soil.<ref name=\"Endler\" /><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jain|first1=S K|last2=Bradshaw|first2=A D|title=Evolutionary divergence among adjacent plant populations I.

In this way, these clines are both biologically (no clear subgroups) and geographically (contiguous distribution) continuous. \nContinuous clines can be further sub-divided into smooth and stepped clines. \n*Continuous smooth clines are characterised by the lack of any abrupt changes or delineation in the genetic or phenotypic trait across the cline, instead displaying a smooth gradation throughout. Huxley recognised that this type of cline, with its uniform slope throughout, was unlikely to be common. \n*Continuous stepped clines consist of an overall shallow cline, interspersed by sections of much steeper slope. The shallow slope represents the populations, and the shorter, steeper sections the larger change in character between populations.<ref name=\"hedrick\">{{cite book|last1=Hedrick|first1=Philip|title=Genetics of Populations|date=2011|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning}}</ref> Stepped clines can be further subdivided into horizontally stepped clines, and obliquely stepped clines. \n**Horizontally stepped clines show no intra-population variation or gradation in the character, therefore displaying a horizontal gradient. These uniform populations are connected by steeper sections of the cline, characterised by larger changes in the form of the character. However, because in continuous clines all populations exchange genetic material, the intergradation zone between the groups can never have a vertical slope.<ref name=\"hedrick\" /> \n**In obliquely stepped clines, conversely, each population also demonstrates a cline in the character, albeit of a shallower slope than the clines connecting the populations together. Huxley compared obliquely stepped clines to looking like a \u201cstepped ramp\u201d, rather than taking on the formation of a staircase as in the case of horizontally stepped clines.<ref name=\"Huxley biography\" />\n\n===Discontinuous stepped clines===\nUnlike in continuous clines, in discontinuous clines the populations of species are allopatric, meaning there is very little or no gene flow amongst populations. The genetic or phenotypic trait in question always shows a steeper gradient between groups than within groups, as in continuous clines. Discontinuous clines follow the same principles as continuous clines by displaying either\n*Horizontally stepped clines, where intra-group variation is very small or non-existent and the geographic space separating groups shows a sharp change in character\n*Obliquely stepped clines, where there is some intra-group gradation, but this is less than the gradation in the character between populations<ref name=\"Huxley\" />\n\n==Clines and speciation==\n[[File:Parapatric Speciation Schematic.svg|thumb|upright=1|[[Parapatric speciation]]]]\nIt was originally assumed that geographic isolation was a necessary precursor to speciation ([[allopatric speciation]]).<ref name=\"Mayr1942\">{{cite book|last1=Mayr|first1=Ernst|title=Systematics and the Origin of Species from the viewpoint of a zoologist|url=https://archive.org/details/systematicsorigi0000mayr_p8z7|url-access=registration|date=1942|publisher=Columbia University Press}}</ref> The possibility that clines may be a precursor to speciation was therefore ignored, as they were assumed to be evidence of the fact that in contiguous populations gene flow was too strong a force of homogenisation, and selection too weak a force of differentiation, for speciation to take place.<ref name=\"Endler\" /> However, the existence of particular types of clines, such as [[ring species]], in which populations did not differentiate in allopatry but the terminal ends of the cline nonetheless do not interbreed, cast into doubt whether complete geographical isolation of populations is an absolute requirement for speciation.\n\nBecause clines can exist in populations connected by some degree of gene flow, the generation of new species from a previously clinal population is termed [[parapatric speciation]]. Both extrinsic and intrinsic selection can serve to generate varying degrees of [[reproductive isolation]] and thereby instigate the process of [[speciation]]. For example, through environmental selection acting on populations and favouring particular allele frequencies, large genetic differences between populations may accumulate (this would be reflected in clinal structure by the presence of numerous very steep clines). If the local genetic differences are great enough, it may lead unfavourable combinations of genotypes and therefore to hybrids being at a decreased fitness relative to the parental lines. When this hybrid disadvantage is great enough, natural selection will select for [[Reproductive isolation#Pre-zygotic isolation|pre-zygotic]] traits in the homozygous parental lines that reduce the likelihood of disadvantageous hybridisation - in other words, natural selection will favour traits that promote assortative mating in the parental lines.<ref name=\"EoE\">{{cite book|last1=Jorgensen|first1=Sven|last2=Fath|first2=Brian|title=Encyclopaedia of Ecology|date=2014|publisher=Newnes}}</ref> This is known as [[Reinforcement (speciation)|reinforcement]] and plays an important role in parapatric and [[sympatric speciation]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Coyne|first1=Jerry A.|last2=Orr|first2=H.

Character states can however additionally be represented using isophenes, defined by Ernst Mayr as \u201clines of equal expression of a clinally varying character\u201d.<ref name=\"Mayr1963\" /> In other words, areas on maps that demonstrate the same biological phenomenon or character will be connected by something that resembles a contour line. When mapping clines therefore, which follow a character gradation from one extreme to the other, isophenes will transect clinal lines at a right angle.\n\n==Examples of clines==\n[[File:Northern red fox & southern desert red fox.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Bergmann's Rule demonstrated showing the difference in size between a larger northern fox, whose range spans colder regions, and a smaller desert fox, whose range is primarily in hot regions.]]\nAlthough the term \u201ccline\u201d was first officially coined by Huxley in 1938, gradients and geographic variations in the character states of species have been observed for centuries. Indeed, some gradations have been considered so ubiquitous that they have been labelled [[Biological rules|ecological \u201crules\u201d]]. One commonly cited example of a gradient in morphology is [[Gloger's rule|Gloger's Rule]], named after [[C. L. Gloger|Constantin Gloger]], who observed in 1833 that environmental factors and the pigmentation of avian [[plumage]] tend to covary with each other, such that birds found in arid areas near the Equator tend to be much darker than those in less arid areas closer to the Poles.  Since then, this rule has been extended to include many other animals, including flies, butterflies, and wolves.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Huggett|first1=Richard J.|title=Fundamentals of Biogeography|date=2004|publisher=Psychology Press}}</ref>\n\nOther ecogeographical rules include [[Bergmann\u2019s rule|Bergmann's Rule]], coined by [[Carl Bergmann (anatomist)|Carl Bergmann]] in 1857, which states that [[Homeothermy|homeotherms]] closer to the Equator tend to be smaller than their more northerly or southerly conspecifics.<ref name=\"Wool\" /> One of the proposed reasons for this cline is that larger animals have a relatively smaller surface area to volume ratio and therefore improved heat conservancy \u2013 an important advantage in cold climates.<ref name=\"Wool\">{{cite book|last1=Wool|first1=David|title=The Driving Forces of Evolution: Genetic Processes in Populations|date=2006|publisher=CRC Press|page=163|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ydWuuBw6xeYC&dq=huxley+1942+cline|isbn=9781578084456}}</ref> The role of the environment in imposing a selective pressure and producing this cline has been heavily implicated due to the fact that Bergmann\u2019s Rule has been observed across many independent lineages of species and continents. For example, the [[house sparrow]], which was introduced in the early 1850s to the eastern United States, evolved a north-south gradient in size soon after its introduction. This gradient reflects the gradient that already existed in the house sparrow\u2019s native range in Europe.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Huggett|first1=Richard J.|title=Geoecology: An evolutionary approach|date=1995|publisher=Routledge|url=https://archive.org/details/geoecologyevolut0000hugg|url-access=registration|isbn=9780415086899}}</ref> \n\t\n[[File:Ring Species (gene flow around a barrier) BLANK.png|thumb|right|Interbreeding populations represented by a gradient of coloured circles around a geographic barrier]]\n[[File:Ring species seagull.svg|thumb|right|The ''Larus'' gulls interbreed in a ring around the arctic.<br />1: ''Larus argentatus argentatus'', 2: ''Larus fuscus'' (''sensu stricto''), 3: ''Larus fuscus heuglini'', 4: ''Larus argentatus birulai'', 5: ''Larus argentatus vegae'', 6: ''Larus argentatus smithsonianus'', 7: ''Larus argentatus argenteus'']]\n[[Ring species]]<ref>''Fundamentals of biogeography'', Richard J.

The populations elsewhere along the cline interbreed with their geographically adjacent populations as in a standard cline. In the case of ''[[Larus]]'' gulls, the habitats of the end populations even overlap, which introduces questions as to what constitutes a species: nowhere along the cline can a line be drawn between the populations, but they are unable to interbreed.\n\nIn humans, clines in the frequency of blood types has allowed scientists to infer past population migrations. For example, the Type B blood group reaches its highest frequency in Asia, but become less frequent further west. From this, it has been possible to infer that some Asian populations migrated towards Europe around 2,000 years ago, causing genetic admixture in an [[isolation by distance]] model. In contrast to this cline, blood Type A shows the reverse pattern, reaching its highest frequency in Europe and declining in frequency towards Asia.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Birx|first1=H.
