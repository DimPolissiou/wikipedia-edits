John J. Shipherd]] and 39 missionaries, including Oberlin faculty, students, and alumni, came to Michigan to create a college, which Shipherd deemed \"New Oberlin.\"\n\nThe original land for the college was to be in present-day [[Ingham County]], approximately {{convert|25|mi|km|spell=in}} from where the college stands. Olivetian lore says that while Shipherd was on a trip to the site in Ingham County, his horse continued to get lost, and would always wander back to a hill above a swamp, which is where Olivet's Campus Square exists today. Shipherd decided that powers from above must be drawing the horse back to this site, and Shipherd deemed that this would become the site for \"New Oberlin.\" He then chose to name it Olivet, however, after the biblical [[Mount of Olives]]. Shortly after the founding of the college, John Shipherd succumbed to malaria, as many other early Olivetians would.\n\nIt is said that the founders of Olivet College believed in three essential components: first was a [[coeducational]] experience; service was another integral part of the founders' visions, as the founders helped to build the surrounding community as well as the broader community; they also believed that an education could be had by anyone, not just those \"rich in the world's goods.\" Abolitionist beliefs, along with a coeducational experience, led the state legislature to deny a charter for the college until thirteen years after the first courses were offered. Some Olivetians believe that the charter was denied because of possible competition with [[Michigan College]].\n\nThe first courses began in December 1844. Because President Reuben Hatch's petition for a charter was denied, Olivet became the Olivet Institute, and remained a two-year school until chartered in 1859.\n\nThe 20th century saw Olivet College become a liberal arts school, with a short-lived attempt at an [[Oxford]]-style curriculum from 1934 to 1944.\n\nAfter assuming leadership in 2010, President Steven Corey announced the \"Olivet College 2020 and Beyond Strategic Plan\", which includes renovating existing buildings and facilities, creating a new student center, increasing endowment, and expand the student population to 1,500.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.olivetcollege.edu/about/strategic-plan/|title=Strategic Plan \u00bb Olivet College|work=Olivet College|access-date=2017-07-12|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\nOlivet offers 32 programs that lead to a [[bachelor's degree]] and a [[master's degree]] of Business Administration in Insurance.

The film was adapted from Chayefsky's only novel and is his final screenplay. Both the novel and the film are based in part on [[John C. Lilly]]'s [[sensory deprivation]] research conducted in [[isolation tank]]s under the influence of [[psychoactive drugs]] like [[mescaline]], [[ketamine]], and [[LSD]].\n\nIt marked the film debut of [[William Hurt]] and [[Drew Barrymore]]. Chayefsky withdrew from the project after disputes with Russell and took his name off the credits, substituting \"Sidney Aaron,\" his actual first and middle names.\n\nThe [[film score]] was composed by [[John Corigliano]] (with [[Christopher Keene]] conducting). The film was nominated for the [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound Mixing]].\n\n==Plot==\nEdward Jessup is a [[psychopathologist]] who, while studying [[schizophrenia]], begins to think that \"our [[Altered state of consciousness|other states of consciousness]] are as real as our waking states.\" Edward begins experimenting with [[sensory deprivation]] using a [[flotation tank]], aided by two like-minded researchers, Arthur Rosenberg and Mason Parrish. At a faculty party, he meets fellow \"whiz kid\" and [[biological anthropologist]] Emily, and the two eventually marry.\n\nSeven years later, Edward and Emily have two daughters, are on the brink of divorce, and reunite with the couple who first introduced them. When Edward hears of a Mexican tribe that experiences shared illusion states, he travels to Mexico to participate in what is apparently an [[Ayahuasca]] Ceremony. During the walk into the bush, his guide says that the indigenous tribe they are meeting works with ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'', which they are collecting for next year's ceremonies. The tribe calls one of the ingredients of the mixture they use \"First Flower.\"  An indigenous elder is seen with ''[[Banisteriopsis caapi]]'' root in his hand before cutting Edward's hand, adding blood to the mixture he is preparing. Immediately after consuming the mixture, Edward experiences bizarre, intense hallucinations. He returns to the U.S. with a [[tincture]] and continues taking it to trigger altered states of consciousness.\n\nWhen toxic concentrations of the substance make increased dosage dangerous, Edward returns to sensory deprivation, believing it will enhance the effects of the substance at his current dose. Repairing a disused tank in a medical school, Edward uses it to experience a series of increasingly drastic visions, including one of early [[Hominidae]]. Monitored by his colleagues, Edward insists that his visions have \"externalized\". Emerging from the tank, his mouth bloody, frantically writing notes because he is unable to speak, Edward insists on being X-rayed before he \"reconstitutes.\" A radiologist inspecting the X-rays says they belong to a gorilla.\n\nIn later experiments, Edward experiences actual, physical [[biological devolution]]. At one stage he emerges from the isolation tank as a feral and curiously small-statured, light-skinned [[Human evolution|caveman]], going on a rampage through some streets in town before returning to his natural form. Despite his colleagues' concern, Edward stubbornly continues.\n\nIn the final experiment, Edward experiences a more profound regression, transforming into an amorphous mass of conscious, primordial matter. An energy wave released from the experiment stuns Edward's colleagues and destroys his tank. Emily arrives to find a swirling maelstrom where the tank had been. She searches the vortex for Edward, finding him as he is on the brink of becoming a non-physical form of proto-consciousness and possibly disappearing from our version of reality altogether.\n\nHis friends bring Edward home, hoping that the transformations will end. Watched over by Emily, Edward begins to uncontrollably regress again, the transformations no longer requiring the intake of \"first flower\" or sensory deprivation. Urging Edward to fight the change, Emily grabs his hand, immediately being enveloped by the primordial energy emanating from Edward. The sight of his wife apparently being consumed by the energy stirs the human consciousness in Edward's devolving form. He fights the transformation and returns to his human form. In the final scene, Edward embraces Emily, and she returns to normal.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[William Hurt]] as Dr. Edward \"Eddie\" Jessup\n* [[Blair Brown]] as Emily Jessup\n* [[Bob Balaban]] as Arthur Rosenberg\n* [[Charles Haid]] as Mason Parrish\n* [[Thaao Penghlis]] as Eduardo Echeverria\n* [[Drew Barrymore]] as Margaret Jessup\n* Megan Jeffers as Grace Jessup\n* [[Dori Brenner]] as Sylvia Rosenberg\n* Peter Brandon as Alan Hobart\n* [[George Gaynes]] as Dr. Wissenschaft\n* [[Jack Murdock (actor)|Jack Murdock]] as Hector Orteco\n* [[John Larroquette]] as X-ray technician\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe film had its origins with a meeting Paddy Chayefsky had with his friends [[Bob Fosse]] and [[Herb Gardner]] at the Russian Tea Room in 1975. They were feeling \"disgruntled\" and as a joke conceived a movie they could make together. They wanted to pitch something to [[Dino De Laurentiis]], who was making ''King Kong''.

Chayefsky reportedly tried to have Russell removed as director, but by then the film was already well under way, and the studio already had replaced one director (Penn).\n\nRussell said Chayefsky \"didn't like the color of the paint on the isolation tank. Then it went on to other things. He didn't like the lighting, then he didn't like the machinery, then he thought I was making the actors appear drunk in a scene where they were written to be slightly tipsy in a bar...

If it is not wholly visionary at every juncture, it is at least dependably\u2014even exhilaratingly\u2014bizarre. Its strangeness, which borders cheerfully on the ridiculous, is its most enjoyable feature.\"<ref name=\"nyt\"/> She also called it \"in fine shape as long as it revels in its own craziness, making no claims on the viewer's reason. But when it asks you to believe that what you're watching may really be happening, and to wonder what it means, it is asking far too much. By the time it begins straining for an ending both happy and hysterical, it has lost all of its mystery, and most of its magic.\"<ref name=\"nyt\"/>\n\nRichard Corliss began his review of the film thus:<ref name=\"time\"/>\n:This one has everything: sex, violence, comedy, thrills, tenderness. It's an anthology and apotheosis of American pop movies: ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'', ''[[Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932 film)|Murders in the Rue Morgue]]'', ''[[The Nutty Professor (1963 film)|The Nutty Professor]]'', ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001]]'', ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', ''[[Love Story (1970 film)|Love Story]]''. It opens at fever pitch and then starts soaring\u2014into genetic fantasy, into a precognitive dream of delirium and delight. Madness is its subject and substance, style and spirit. The film changes tone, even form, with its hero's every new mood and mutation. It expands and contracts with his mind until both almost crack. It keeps threatening to go bonkers, then makes good on its threat, and still remains as lucid as an aerialist on a [[high wire]]. It moves with the loping energy of a crafty psychopath, or of film makers gripped with the potential of blowing the moviegoer's mind out through his eyes and ears. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to ''Altered States''.\n\nCorliss calls the film a \"dazzling piece of science fiction\"; he recognizes the film's dialogue as clearly Chayefsky's, with characters that are \"endlessly reflective and articulate, spitting out litanies of adjectives, geysers of abstract nouns, chemical chains of relative clauses\", dialogue that's a \"welcome antidote to all those recent...movies in which brutal characters speak only words of one syllable and four letters.\"<ref name=\"time\"/>  But the film is ultimately Russell's, who inherited a \"cast of unknowns\" chosen by its original director and \"gets an erotic, neurotic charge from the talking-heads scenes that recall [[Arthur Penn|Penn]] at his best.\"<ref name=\"time\"/>\n\nPauline Kael, on the other hand, wrote that the \"grotesquely inspired\" combination of \"Russell, with his show-biz-Catholic glitz mysticism, and Chayefsky, with his show-biz-Jewish ponderousness\" results in an \"aggressively silly picture\" that \"isn't really enjoyable.\"<ref name=Kael>{{cite book|last=Kael|first=Pauline|title=Taking It All In|url=https://archive.org/details/takingitallin00kaelrich|url-access=registration|year=1984|publisher=Holt, Rinhart and Winstone|location=New York|isbn=0-03-069361-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/takingitallin00kaelrich/page/127 127\u2013132]}}</ref>\n\n[[John C. Lilly]] liked the film, and noted the following in an ''[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]]'' magazine interview published in January 1983:\n:The scene in which the scientist becomes cosmic energy and his wife grabs him and brings him back to human form is straight out of my ''Dyadic Cyclone'' (1976)...As for the scientist's regression into an ape-like being, the late Dr. Craig Enright, who started me on K (ketamine) while taking a trip with me here by the isolation tank, suddenly \"became\" a chimp, jumping up and down and hollering for twenty-five minutes. Watching him, I was frightened. I asked him later, \"Where the hell were you?\" He said, \"I became a pre-hominid, and I was in a tree. A leopard was trying to get me. So I was trying to scare him away.\"  The manuscript of ''The Scientist'' (1978) was in the hands of Bantam, the publishers. The head of Bantam called and said, \"Paddy Chayefsky would like to read your manuscript. Will you give him your permission?\" I said, \"Only if he calls me and asks permission.\" He didn't call.

The film was adapted from Chayefsky's only novel and is his final screenplay. Both the novel and the film are based in part on [[John C. Lilly]]'s [[sensory deprivation]] research conducted in [[isolation tank]]s under the influence of [[psychoactive drugs]] like [[mescaline]], [[ketamine]], and [[LSD]].\n\nIt marked the film debut of [[William Hurt]] and [[Drew Barrymore]]. Chayefsky withdrew from the project after disputes with Russell and took his name off the credits, substituting \"Sidney Aaron,\" his actual first and middle names.\n\nThe [[film score]] was composed by [[John Corigliano]] (with [[Christopher Keene]] conducting). The film was nominated for the [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound Mixing]].\n\n==Plot==\nEdward Jessup is a [[psychopathologist]] who, while studying [[schizophrenia]], begins to think that \"our [[Altered state of consciousness|other states of consciousness]] are as real as our waking states.\" Edward begins experimenting with [[sensory deprivation]] using a [[flotation tank]], aided by two like-minded researchers, Arthur Rosenberg and Mason Parrish. At a faculty party, he meets fellow \"whiz kid\" and [[biological anthropologist]] Emily, and the two eventually marry.\n\nSeven years later, Edward and Emily have two daughters, are on the brink of divorce, and reunite with the couple who first introduced them. When Edward hears of a Mexican tribe that experiences shared illusion states, he travels to Mexico to participate in what is apparently an [[Ayahuasca]] Ceremony. During the walk into the bush, his guide says that the indigenous tribe they are meeting works with ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'', which they are collecting for next year's ceremonies. The tribe calls one of the ingredients of the mixture they use \"First Flower.\"  An indigenous elder is seen with ''[[Banisteriopsis caapi]]'' root in his hand before cutting Edward's hand, adding blood to the mixture he is preparing. Immediately after consuming the mixture, Edward experiences bizarre, intense hallucinations. He returns to the U.S. with a [[tincture]] and continues taking it to trigger altered states of consciousness.\n\nWhen toxic concentrations of the substance make increased dosage dangerous, Edward returns to sensory deprivation, believing it will enhance the effects of the substance at his current dose. Repairing a disused tank in a medical school, Edward uses it to experience a series of increasingly drastic visions, including one of early [[Hominidae]]. Monitored by his colleagues, Edward insists that his visions have \"externalized\". Emerging from the tank, his mouth bloody, frantically writing notes because he is unable to speak, Edward insists on being X-rayed before he \"reconstitutes.\" A radiologist inspecting the X-rays says they belong to a gorilla.\n\nIn later experiments, Edward experiences actual, physical [[biological devolution]]. At one stage he emerges from the isolation tank as a feral and curiously small-statured, light-skinned [[Human evolution|caveman]], going on a rampage through some streets in town before returning to his natural form. Despite his colleagues' concern, Edward stubbornly continues.\n\nIn the final experiment, Edward experiences a more profound regression, transforming into an amorphous mass of conscious, primordial matter. An energy wave released from the experiment stuns Edward's colleagues and destroys his tank. Emily arrives to find a swirling maelstrom where the tank had been. She searches the vortex for Edward, finding him as he is on the brink of becoming a non-physical form of proto-consciousness and possibly disappearing from our version of reality altogether.\n\nHis friends bring Edward home, hoping that the transformations will end. Watched over by Emily, Edward begins to uncontrollably regress again, the transformations no longer requiring the intake of \"first flower\" or sensory deprivation. Urging Edward to fight the change, Emily grabs his hand, immediately being enveloped by the primordial energy emanating from Edward. The sight of his wife apparently being consumed by the energy stirs the human consciousness in Edward's devolving form. He fights the transformation and returns to his human form. In the final scene, Edward embraces Emily, and she returns to normal.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[William Hurt]] as Dr. Edward \"Eddie\" Jessup\n* [[Blair Brown]] as Emily Jessup\n* [[Bob Balaban]] as Arthur Rosenberg\n* [[Charles Haid]] as Mason Parrish\n* [[Thaao Penghlis]] as Eduardo Echeverria\n* [[Drew Barrymore]] as Margaret Jessup\n* Megan Jeffers as Grace Jessup\n* [[Dori Brenner]] as Sylvia Rosenberg\n* Peter Brandon as Alan Hobart\n* [[George Gaynes]] as Dr. Wissenschaft\n* [[Jack Murdock (actor)|Jack Murdock]] as Hector Orteco\n* [[John Larroquette]] as X-ray technician\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe film had its origins with a meeting Paddy Chayefsky had with his friends [[Bob Fosse]] and [[Herb Gardner]] at the Russian Tea Room in 1975.

During this time Chayefsky and Russell had a massive dispute and the writer left the project. He did not appear on set during filming, contrary to his normal practice.<ref name=\"mann\">Russell Films 'Altered States'.

He was joking but he wasn't joking\u2019.\"<ref name=\"danger\"/>\n\nItzkoff's book chronicles the making of ''Altered States'' and claims that Russell, objecting to Chayefsky's interference, had the writer banned from the set. Chayefsky reportedly tried to have Russell removed as director, but by then the film was already well under way, and the studio already had replaced one director (Penn).\n\nRussell said Chayefsky \"didn't like the color of the paint on the isolation tank. Then it went on to other things. He didn't like the lighting, then he didn't like the machinery, then he thought I was making the actors appear drunk in a scene where they were written to be slightly tipsy in a bar... There was a lot of embarrassing dialogue, and there was a hell of a lot more in the original script than there is now; it was a verbose script.\"<ref name=\"jay\">'Mad doctor' Russell creates a monster hit. Scott, Jay.

Film critic [[Janet Maslin]], in her review of the film, thought it \"easy to guess why\":<ref name=\"nyt\">[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B07E6DB1339F936A15751C1A966948260 Review of ''Altered States''], a December 25, 1980, article in ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref>\n:It's easy to guess why [screenwriter Chayefsky] and [director Ken Russell] didn't see eye to eye. The direction, without being mocking or campy, treats outlandish material so matter-of-factly that it often has a facetious ring. The screenplay, on the other hand, cries out to be taken seriously, as it addresses, with no particular sagacity, the death of God and the [[origin of man|origins of man]].\n\nFilm critic [[Richard Corliss]] attributed Chayefsky's disavowal of the film to distress over \"the intensity of the performances and the headlong pace at which the actors read his dialogue.\"<ref name=\"time\">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,922287-1,00.html Invasion of the Mind Snatcher], a December 1980 review by [[Richard Corliss]] in [[Time (magazine)|Time]]''</ref>\n\n\"Paddy's hallucinations were impossible to film,\" said Russell later. \"He'd write a direction, something like Interstellar gas shot through 5 million miles of universe like a puff of cigarette smoke.' But when I read the script, I realized the picture would only succeed to the extent that it dramatized a certain experience common to all men.

He later said \"I thought I would hate Hollywood, but I rather liked it.

If it is not wholly visionary at every juncture, it is at least dependably\u2014even exhilaratingly\u2014bizarre. Its strangeness, which borders cheerfully on the ridiculous, is its most enjoyable feature.\"<ref name=\"nyt\"/> She also called it \"in fine shape as long as it revels in its own craziness, making no claims on the viewer's reason. But when it asks you to believe that what you're watching may really be happening, and to wonder what it means, it is asking far too much. By the time it begins straining for an ending both happy and hysterical, it has lost all of its mystery, and most of its magic.\"<ref name=\"nyt\"/>\n\nRichard Corliss began his review of the film thus:<ref name=\"time\"/>\n:This one has everything: sex, violence, comedy, thrills, tenderness. It's an anthology and apotheosis of American pop movies: ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'', ''[[Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932 film)|Murders in the Rue Morgue]]'', ''[[The Nutty Professor (1963 film)|The Nutty Professor]]'', ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001]]'', ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', ''[[Love Story (1970 film)|Love Story]]''. It opens at fever pitch and then starts soaring\u2014into genetic fantasy, into a precognitive dream of delirium and delight. Madness is its subject and substance, style and spirit. The film changes tone, even form, with its hero's every new mood and mutation. It expands and contracts with his mind until both almost crack. It keeps threatening to go bonkers, then makes good on its threat, and still remains as lucid as an aerialist on a [[high wire]]. It moves with the loping energy of a crafty psychopath, or of film makers gripped with the potential of blowing the moviegoer's mind out through his eyes and ears. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to ''Altered States''.\n\nCorliss calls the film a \"dazzling piece of science fiction\"; he recognizes the film's dialogue as clearly Chayefsky's, with characters that are \"endlessly reflective and articulate, spitting out litanies of adjectives, geysers of abstract nouns, chemical chains of relative clauses\", dialogue that's a \"welcome antidote to all those recent...movies in which brutal characters speak only words of one syllable and four letters.\"<ref name=\"time\"/>  But the film is ultimately Russell's, who inherited a \"cast of unknowns\" chosen by its original director and \"gets an erotic, neurotic charge from the talking-heads scenes that recall [[Arthur Penn|Penn]] at his best.\"<ref name=\"time\"/>\n\nPauline Kael, on the other hand, wrote that the \"grotesquely inspired\" combination of \"Russell, with his show-biz-Catholic glitz mysticism, and Chayefsky, with his show-biz-Jewish ponderousness\" results in an \"aggressively silly picture\" that \"isn't really enjoyable.\"<ref name=Kael>{{cite book|last=Kael|first=Pauline|title=Taking It All In|url=https://archive.org/details/takingitallin00kaelrich|url-access=registration|year=1984|publisher=Holt, Rinhart and Winstone|location=New York|isbn=0-03-069361-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/takingitallin00kaelrich/page/127 127\u2013132]}}</ref>\n\n[[John C. Lilly]] liked the film, and noted the following in an ''[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]]'' magazine interview published in January 1983:\n:The scene in which the scientist becomes cosmic energy and his wife grabs him and brings him back to human form is straight out of my ''Dyadic Cyclone'' (1976)...As for the scientist's regression into an ape-like being, the late Dr. Craig Enright, who started me on K (ketamine) while taking a trip with me here by the isolation tank, suddenly \"became\" a chimp, jumping up and down and hollering for twenty-five minutes. Watching him, I was frightened. I asked him later, \"Where the hell were you?\" He said, \"I became a pre-hominid, and I was in a tree. A leopard was trying to get me. So I was trying to scare him away.\"  The manuscript of ''The Scientist'' (1978) was in the hands of Bantam, the publishers. The head of Bantam called and said, \"Paddy Chayefsky would like to read your manuscript. Will you give him your permission?\" I said, \"Only if he calls me and asks permission.\" He didn't call.

In the 1830s, it attempted to conduct [[Indian Removal]] of the [[Seminole]] and [[Creek people]]s, who had migrated south to escape European-American encroachment in Georgia and Alabama. After many Seminole were forcibly removed from the area or moved south to the Everglades during the [[Seminole Wars]], planters developed cotton plantations based on enslaved labor.\n\nBy the 1850s and 1860s, Leon County had become part of the \"cotton kingdom\" of the Deep South. It ranked fifth of all [[Florida]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] counties in the production of cotton from the 20 major plantations. Uniquely among Confederate capitals east of the [[Mississippi River]], in the [[American Civil War]] Tallahassee was never captured by Union forces.

According to an article written in Africology: The Journal of Pan African Studies, The library was built on the campus of Florida A&M University because the city refused the donation based on the fact that it would have to serve the black citizens.  \"The facility boasted modern amenities such as electricity, indoor plumbing and water supplied by the city. In later years, the Library served as an art gallery, religious center, and in 1976, became the founding home of the Black Archives Research Center and Museum.

According to the Leon County Public Library's website, the American Association of University Women formed the Friends of the Library organization in 1954.  The formation of the Friends of the Library was in direct response to the fact that \"Tallahassee was the only state capital in the United States not offering free public library service.\" <ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\">Leon County.

In 1956 the first Leon County free public library opened on March 21.  The first building used to house the library was The Columns, one of the  oldest remaining antebellum homes in the Leon County area located at Park Avenue and Adams street (the building today is home of the James Madison Institute).\n\nIn order to expand library services the Junior League of Tallahassee donated a bookmobile to the library. The vehicle was later donated to the Leon County Sheriff's Office to be used as a paddy wagon for its Road Prison.\nIn 1962 the library moved to the old Elks Club building at 127 North Monroe Street. Public transit in the city of Tallahassee was desegregated by 1958, yet it would several more years before the public library system would experience integration.\n\nIn the early 70's Jefferson and Wakulla counties joined the Leon County Public Library System, forming the Leon, Jefferson, and Wakulla County Public Library System. According to the library's web site, \"Leon County provided administrative and other services to the two smaller counties, while each supported the direct costs of their library services and their share of Leon's administrative costs.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  In 1975 the system started a branch library in the Bond community, a predominantly black community on the city's Southside. Wakulla County left the library cooperative in 1975 to start its own library system and in 1978 the main library moved to a location in Tallahassee's Northwood Mall.  Jefferson County left the library cooperative in 1980 and the library reverted to the Leon County Public Library.  In 1989 \"ground breaking was held on March 4 for a new $8.5 million main library facility with 88,000 feet of space. The site was next door to the library's original home, The Columns, which had been moved in 1971 to 100 N.

In the 1830s, it attempted to conduct [[Indian Removal]] of the [[Seminole]] and [[Creek people]]s, who had migrated south to escape European-American encroachment in Georgia and Alabama. After many Seminole were forcibly removed from the area or moved south to the Everglades during the [[Seminole Wars]], planters developed cotton plantations based on enslaved labor.\n\nBy the 1850s and 1860s, Leon County had become part of the \"cotton kingdom\" of the Deep South. It ranked fifth of all [[Florida]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] counties in the production of cotton from the 20 major plantations. Uniquely among Confederate capitals east of the [[Mississippi River]], in the [[American Civil War]] Tallahassee was never captured by Union forces. No Union soldiers set foot in Leon County until the [[Reconstruction Era]].\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|702|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|667|sqmi}} are land and {{convert|35|sqmi}} (5.0%) are water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> Unlike much of Florida, most of Leon County has rolling hills, part of north Florida's [[Red Hills Region]].

This library was the first and only public library in the city of Tallahassee until 1955.  The philanthropist, Andrew Carnegie offered the city of Tallahassee money to build a public library in 1906. According to an article written in Africology: The Journal of Pan African Studies, The library was built on the campus of Florida A&M University because the city refused the donation based on the fact that it would have to serve the black citizens.  \"The facility boasted modern amenities such as electricity, indoor plumbing and water supplied by the city. In later years, the Library served as an art gallery, religious center, and in 1976, became the founding home of the Black Archives Research Center and Museum. By functioning both as a repository for archival records and a museum for historical regalia, the center continues to render academic support to educational institutions, civic, political, religious and Museum.

On November 17, 1978, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe Carnegie Library of Tallahassee which only served the black community became the only free public library in the city until 1955.  According to the Leon County Public Library's website, the American Association of University Women formed the Friends of the Library organization in 1954.  The formation of the Friends of the Library was in direct response to the fact that \"Tallahassee was the only state capital in the United States not offering free public library service.\" <ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\">Leon County. (2002-2016). Library History. Retrieved April 09, 2018, from Leon County Florida Government: http://cms.leoncountyfl.gov/Library/LibraryInformation/Library-History</ref>  One year later, the library was established in May by legislative action and was developed by citizens and civic groups.  In 1956 the first Leon County free public library opened on March 21.  The first building used to house the library was The Columns, one of the  oldest remaining antebellum homes in the Leon County area located at Park Avenue and Adams street (the building today is home of the James Madison Institute).\n\nIn order to expand library services the Junior League of Tallahassee donated a bookmobile to the library. The vehicle was later donated to the Leon County Sheriff's Office to be used as a paddy wagon for its Road Prison.\nIn 1962 the library moved to the old Elks Club building at 127 North Monroe Street. Public transit in the city of Tallahassee was desegregated by 1958, yet it would several more years before the public library system would experience integration.\n\nIn the early 70's Jefferson and Wakulla counties joined the Leon County Public Library System, forming the Leon, Jefferson, and Wakulla County Public Library System. According to the library's web site, \"Leon County provided administrative and other services to the two smaller counties, while each supported the direct costs of their library services and their share of Leon's administrative costs.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  In 1975 the system started a branch library in the Bond community, a predominantly black community on the city's Southside. Wakulla County left the library cooperative in 1975 to start its own library system and in 1978 the main library moved to a location in Tallahassee's Northwood Mall.  Jefferson County left the library cooperative in 1980 and the library reverted to the Leon County Public Library.  In 1989 \"ground breaking was held on March 4 for a new $8.5 million main library facility with 88,000 feet of space. The site was next door to the library's original home, The Columns, which had been moved in 1971 to 100 N. Duval.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  The new library had its grand opening in 1991 and was renamed in 1993 in honor of former Governor LeRoy Collins.\n\n==Points of interest==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Alfred B.

The 35-year period (1940\u20131974) preceding and including the UCLA streak was characterized by less dynasties, however: 20 different men's teams won titles during that span. In comparison, the women's game to date has produced 35% less (tournament) parity, with 13 schools winning all 35 titles offered since its inception.\n\nPast rosters of UCLA basketball teams have included greats such as [[Rafer Johnson]] who was the 1960 Olympic Decathlon Champion, [[Gail Goodrich]], [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] (then known as Lew Alcindor), [[Bill Walton]], [[Reggie Miller]] and [[Walt Hazzard]].

Morgan Athletics Center in November 1983, UCLA established an athletics Hall of Fame with 25 charter members representing a cross-section of the school's athletic history.  Each year, a minimum of one and a maximum of eight former UCLA athletes, coaches or administrators are added to the Hall of Fame.  Upon its 23rd year of existence, The Hall of Fame was moved to a new location facing Westwood Plaza. The new Hall of Fame is now double in size after its renovation and expansion, which was completed in the Winter of 2000. The first floor in the east wing of the new J.D.
