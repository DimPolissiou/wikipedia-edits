Humf lives in the middle flat with Wallace at the top of him and Loon at the bottom of him. Humf is short, round, cuddly and curious about the world around him. He has a rather square shaped toy named Crispy Cakehead\n\n'''Wallace'''\n\nWallace is a green hairy thing who runs around a lot and often ruins games on Humf and Loon, though not deliberately. He laughs quite a lot, too, and lives on the very top floor of the 3-story building. He always says hello more than once and his other catchphrase is saying things are his \"favourite thing\". He also loves to play Supertiger, Elephants. & falling down, most o f the time with his friends Humf and Loon.\n\n'''Loon'''\n\nLoon is a pink feathery thing who lives in the flat below Humf. She loves to go out to the park and the supermarket, most of the time with her friends Humf and Wallace, along with her mum. She is the only one of the three friends who has yet to be shown a dad. She is also described as being a snob as she always gets her own way.\n\n==Places==\n'''The characters homes'''\n\nMost episodes will spend some time in one or another of the main characters flats.\n\n'''The park'''\n\nOften, episodes will spend some time in a local park which is within walking distance of the flats and involves crossing a road to get there. The park has play equipment as well as a sand pit and green open spaces to run around in.\n\n==Typical plot==\nIn general, plots are centred on Humf and his exploration of the world. An example would be when Humf and his friends go to the park and see litter on the floor. They discuss it and then start to pick it up and put it in the bin with increasing vigour. Humf's mum interrupts when he goes to pick up a banana skin and explains that to be safe they should not attempt to pick up all litter as some is yucky.\n\n==Other details==\nThe series is aimed at pre-school children and was created by [[Andrew Brenner]], directed by [[Neil Fitzgibben]] and produced by [[Alexi Wheeler]].\n\n==Episode list==\n===Season 1===\n# Humf's Shadow\n# Humf Hangs Up The Laundry\n# Humf Is Hiding\n# Humf And The Ants\n# Humf's Friends\n# Humf Is A Furry Thing\n# Humf And The Scary Thing\n# Humf's Special Stick\n# Humf And The Hole In The Park\n# Humf And The Balloons\n# Humf's Special Cup\n# Humf's Ball\n# Humf's Favourite Book\n# Humf Wakes Up Early\n# Humf's Picnic\n# Humf And The Tickle Monster\n# Humf And The Moon\n# Humf And All The Stars\n# Uncle Hairy's Band\n# Humf Goes Fast\n# Humf's New Word\n# Humf Gets Lost\n# Humf Bakes Biscuits\n# Humf In The Fog\n# Slow Down Wallace\n# Humf And The Big Boots\n# Wallace's Bath\n# Humf's Painting\n# Loon's New Handbag\n# Wallace Pretends Too Much\n# Loon's Pushchair\n# Humf Goes Very High\n# Wallace's Quiet Game\n# Humf's Red Mittens\n# Humf Climbs A Mountain\n# Uncle Hairy's Restaurant\n# Uncle Hairy's Cinema\n# Humf And The Fluffy Thing\n# Mum And Dad's Party\n# Loon's Ballet Lesson\n# Humf's Surprise\n# Humf And The Bed Bugs\n# Humf And Wallace Fall Down\n# Humf Changes His Mind\n# Dad Goes On An Aeroplane\n# Humf Puts It In The Bin\n# Humf's Dog\n# Humf And Loon's Special Treat\n# Wallace's Favourite Toy\n# Wallace's Tie\n===Season 2===\n# Uncle Hairy's Keys\n# Sitting Next To Uncle Hairy\n# Mum's Flower\n# Fireman Wallace\n# Loon's Treasure\n# Loon's Jack In The Box\n# Humf's Splinter\n# Wallace Won't Come Home\n# Wallace's Bubbles\n# Uncle Hairy's Takeaway\n# Loon's paddling Pool\n# Loon's Best Friend\n# Humf Goes Swimming\n# Humf's New Name\n# Humf's Busy Family\n# Loon's Blackboard\n# Crispy Cakehead Is Sad\n# Loon's House\n# Humf And The Wind\n# Humf is Very Big\n# Humf's Mum's Phone\n# Everybody Copies Uncle Hairy\n# Humf's Dad Stays in Bed\n# Flora Comes to Babysit\n# Loon Goes Far Away\n# Loon Gets Stuck\n# Uncle Hairy's Magic\n# Wallace Gets Very Cross\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.nickjr.co.uk/shows/humf/default.aspx Humf on Nick Jr.]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140530194005/http://www.humf.tv/ Humf Site] (archived via Wayback Machine)\n\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:British children's animated television programmes]]\n[[Category:British children's television programmes]]\n[[Category:Nick Jr. original programming]]\n[[Category:2000s British animated television series]]\n[[Category:British flash animated television series]]\n[[Category:Television series by Entertainment One]]\n[[Category:2008 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2009 British television series endings]]\n[[Category:2000s British children's television series]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{tone|date=February 2014}}\n{{more citations needed|date=February 2014}}\n}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2012}}\n{{Use British English|date=August 2012}}\n{{Infobox television|\n| show_name = Humf\n| image = \n| caption =\n| runtime = 7 minutes\n| genre = [[Children's television series]]\n| country = United Kingdom\n| company = King Rollo Films\n| network = [[Nick Jr. (UK and Ireland)|Nick Jr.]]\n| first_aired = {{start date|2008|10|3}}\n| last_aired = {{end date|2010|5|20}}\n}}\n\n'''''Humf''''' is a British animated children's television program featuring a \"furry thing\" called Humf.
