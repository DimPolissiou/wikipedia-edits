It is customarily split into an Early and Late division.<ref>Nakata (1972: 175)</ref> Politically, the first half of Late Middle Japanese consists of the end of the [[Heian period]] known as ''Insei'' and the [[Kamakura period]]; the second half of Late Middle Japanese consists of the [[Muromachi period]].\n\n==Background==\nThe end of the 12th century was a time of transition from the [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] society of the nobles in the [[Heian period]] to the [[Feudalism|feudalistic]] society of the [[Samurai|warrior]] class. Accompanying this change, the political center moved with establishment of various [[shogunate]]s in the east.\n\nVarious new Buddhist movements began and [[literacy]] increased due their spread.<ref>Kond\u014d (2005: 97)</ref>\n\nIn the middle of 16th century, [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[Missionary|missionaries]] arrived in [[Japan]]. While introducing western concepts and technology, they also shared their language. Various Portuguese [[gairaigo|loanword]]s entered the language.<ref>Shibatani (1990: 121)</ref>\n\nIn an attempt to spread their [[Kirishitan|religion]], the Portuguese missionaries studied and learned Japanese. They created a number of linguistic [[Arte da Lingoa de Iapam|grammars]], [[Nippo Jisho|dictionaries]], and even translated some of their literature. These resources have proven extremely valuable in Late Middle Japanese studies.\n\n==Phonology==\n\n===Vowels===\nThere were five [[vowel]]s: /i, e, a, o, u/.\n\n* /i/: {{IPA|[i]}}\n* /e/: {{IPA|[je]}}, {{IPA|[e]}}?\n* /a/: {{IPA|[a]}}\n* /o/: {{IPA|[wo]}}, {{IPA|[o]}}?\n* /u/: {{IPA|[u]}}\n\nInitially, /e/ and /o/ were realized with [[semivowel]]s {{IPA|[j]}} and {{IPA|[w]}}, respectively.{{dubious|date=October 2012}} This is a result of earlier mergers inherited from Early Middle Japanese. However, it is unclear and a matter of debate as to how they were realized when preceded by a consonant.<ref name=\"nakata\">Nakata (1972: 181)</ref>\n\nIn addition, there were two types of long ''o'': {{IPA|[\u0254\u02d0]}} and {{IPA|[o\u02d0]}}.

The ''tar-'' type becomes more archaic and is continually reduced in distribution. In Modern Japanese a few [[Japanese adjectives#naru-adjectives|''naru''-adjectives]] and [[Japanese adjectives#taru-adjectives|''taru''-adjectives]] remain as [[Fossilization (linguistics)|fossils]].\n\n===Hypothetical===\nThe realis base develops into the hypothetical.<ref>Yamaguchi (1997:96)</ref> The [[Realis moods|realis]] base was used to describe something that has already occurred. This usage begins to fade and results in hypothetical usage that have not already occurred. Note that Modern Japanese only has a hypothetical, not a realis base anymore.\n\n===Imperative===\nThe imperative traditionally concluded without any suffix or with -yo. During this period, the suffix -i was attached to lower bigrade, k-irregular and s-irregular verbs:<ref>Yamaguchi (1997:97)</ref>\n*kure + i: kurei \"give me\"\n*ko + i: koi \"come\"\n*se + i: sei \"do\"\n\n[[Jo\u00e3o Rodrigues (missionary)|Jo\u00e3o Rodrigues]] notes in ''[[Arte da Lingoa de Japam]]'' that -yo could be replaced with -ro as in miyo > miro \"look\".<ref name=\"yamaguchi\">Yamaguchi (1997:97\u201398)</ref> Note that the eastern dialects of Old Japanese during the 8th century also contained this -ro imperative. It is also the standard imperative in Modern Japanese.\n\n===Tense and aspect===\nThe tense and aspect systems undergo radical changes. The perfective n-, t-, and r- as well as the past tense k-/s- and ker- become obsolete. In their place tar- develops from perfective aspect into a common past tense. This eventually becomes ''ta'', the modern past tense marker.<ref>Shibatani (1990:123)</ref>\n\n===Particles===\nA new case particle ''de'' is developed from ''ni te''.<ref>Kond\u014d (2005: 113-114)</ref>\n\nThe conjecture suffix -mu undergoes a number of phonological changes: mu > m > N > \u0169. Combining with the vowel from the irrealis base to which it attaches, it would then become a long vowel sometimes with a preceding -y-.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Japanese words of Portuguese origin]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Doi\n  | first = Tadao\n  | authorlink = \n  | title = Jidaibetsu Kokugo Daijiten: Muromachi Jidaihen I\n  | publisher = [[Sanseido|Sanseid\u014d]]\n  | year = 1985\n  | location = T\u014dky\u014d\n  | pages = \n  | url = \n  | language = Japanese\n  | doi = \n  | isbn = 4-385-13296-8\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Doi\n  | first = Tadao\n  | authorlink = \n  | title = [[Arte da Lingoa de Japam|Nihon Daibunten]]\n  | publisher = [[Sanseido|Sanseid\u014d]]\n  | year = 1955\n  | origyear = 1604-1608\n  | location = \n  | pages = \n  | url = \n  | doi = \n  | language = Japanese\n  | isbn = 978-4-8301-0297-4 }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Doi\n  | first = Tadao\n  | authorlink =\n  | title = [[Nippo Jisho|H\u014dyaku Nippo Jisho]]\n  | publisher = [[Iwanami Shoten Publishing|Iwanami Shoten]]\n  | year = 1980\n  | origyear = 1603\n  | location = T\u014dky\u014d\n  | pages =\n  | url = \n  | language = Japanese\n  | doi = \n  | isbn =4-00-080021-3\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Frellesvig\n  | first = Bjarke\n  | authorlink = \n  | title = A Case Study in Diachronic Phonology: The Japanese Onbin Sound Changes\n  | publisher = Aarhus University Press\n  | year = 1995\n  | location = \n  | pages = \n  | url = \n  | doi = \n  | isbn = 87-7288-489-4 }}\n* Frellesvig, Bjarke (2010).

The name is derived from the name of an [[extinct language]] called ''[[Chibcha language|Chibcha]]'' or ''Muysccubun'', once spoken by the people who lived on the [[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]] of which the city of [[Bogot\u00e1]] was the southern capital at the time of the Spanish [[Conquista]]. However, genetic and linguistic data now indicate that the original heart of Chibchan languages and Chibchan-speaking peoples may not have been in Colombia at all, but in the area of the [[Costa Rica]]-[[Panama]] border, where one finds the greatest variety of Chibchan languages.\n\n==External relations==\nA larger family called ''[[Macro-Chibchan]]'', which would contain the [[Misumalpan languages]], [[Xinca language|Xinca]], and [[Lenca language|Lenca]], was found convincing by Kaufman (1990).{{fcn|date=June 2019}}\n\n==Classification==\n* A\n** Waim\u00ed (Guaymi)\n*** [[Guaym\u00ed language|Guaym\u00ed]] (Ng\u00e4bere, Movere) \u2013 170,000 speakers, vulnerable in [[Panama]], endangered in [[Costa Rica]]\n*** [[Buglere language|Buglere]] (Bogot\u00e1) \u2013 18,000 speakers, endangered\n** [[Boruca language|Bor\u0169ca]] (Brunca) \u2013 140 speakers, moribund\n** [[Talamanca languages|Talamanca]]\n*** [[Huetar language|Huetar]] (G\u00fcetar) \u2020\n*** [[Bribri language|Bribri]] (Talamanca), 7,000 speakers \u2013 vulnerable in [[Costa Rica]], endangered in [[Panama]]\n*** [[Cab\u00e9car language|Cab\u00e9car]] (Talamanca) \u2013 8,800 speakers, vulnerable\n*** [[Teribe language|Teribe]] (Norte\u00f1o) \u2013 3,300 speakers, endangered\n* B\n** [[Paya language|Pech]] (Paya) \u2013 990 speakers, endangered\n** [[Dorasque language|Dorasque]] \u2020\n** [[Votic languages|Votic]]\n*** [[Rama language|Rama]] \u2013 740 speakers, moribund\n*** [[Voto language|Voto]] \u2020\n*** [[Mal\u00e9ku language|Mal\u00e9ku]] (Guatuso) \u2013 750 speakers, endangered\n*** [[Corobic\u00ed language|Corobic\u00ed]] \u2013 northwestern Costa Rica \u2020\n** Cuna\u2013Colombian\n*** [[Kuna language|Kuna]] (Dulegaya) \u2013 60,600 speakers, vulnerable in [[Panama]], endangered in [[Colombia]]\n*** Chibcha\u2013Motilon\n**** [[Bar\u00ed language|Bar\u00ed]] (Motil\u00f3n) \u2013 5,000 speakers, vulnerable\n**** Chibcha\u2013Tunebo\n***** [[Chibcha language|Chibcha]] \u2020\n***** [[Duit language|Duit]] (Muisca) \u2020\n***** [[Uwa language|U'wa]] (Tunebo) \u2013 2,550 speakers, endangered\n***** [[Guanes|Guane]] \u2020 \u2013 Colombia\n*** Arwako\u2013Chimila\n**** [[Chimila language|Chimila]] \u2013 350 speakers, endangered\n**** Arwako\n***** [[Wiwa language|Wiwa]] (Malayo, Guamaca) \u2013 1,850 speakers, endangered\n***** [[Kankuamo language|Kankuamo]] \u2020\n***** [[Arhuaco language|Arhuaco]] (Ika) \u2013 8,000 speakers, vulnerable\n***** [[Kogi language|Kogi]] ([[Cogui]]) \u2013 9,910 speakers, vulnerable\n\nThe extinct languages of [[Santa Fe de Antioquia|Antioquia]], [[Old Cat\u00edo]] and [[Nutabe language|Nutabe]] have been shown to be Chibchan (Adelaar & Muysken, 2004:49).

The name is derived from the name of an [[extinct language]] called ''[[Chibcha language|Chibcha]]'' or ''Muysccubun'', once spoken by the people who lived on the [[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]] of which the city of [[Bogot\u00e1]] was the southern capital at the time of the Spanish [[Conquista]]. However, genetic and linguistic data now indicate that the original heart of Chibchan languages and Chibchan-speaking peoples may not have been in Colombia at all, but in the area of the [[Costa Rica]]-[[Panama]] border, where one finds the greatest variety of Chibchan languages.\n\n==External relations==\nA larger family called ''[[Macro-Chibchan]]'', which would contain the [[Misumalpan languages]], [[Xinca language|Xinca]], and [[Lenca language|Lenca]], was found convincing by Kaufman (1990).{{fcn|date=June 2019}}\n\n==Classification==\n* A\n** Waim\u00ed (Guaymi)\n*** [[Guaym\u00ed language|Guaym\u00ed]] (Ng\u00e4bere, Movere) \u2013 170,000 speakers, vulnerable in [[Panama]], endangered in [[Costa Rica]]\n*** [[Buglere language|Buglere]] (Bogot\u00e1) \u2013 18,000 speakers, endangered\n** [[Boruca language|Bor\u0169ca]] (Brunca) \u2013 140 speakers, moribund\n** [[Talamanca languages|Talamanca]]\n*** [[Huetar language|Huetar]] (G\u00fcetar) \u2020\n*** [[Bribri language|Bribri]] (Talamanca), 7,000 speakers \u2013 vulnerable in [[Costa Rica]], endangered in [[Panama]]\n*** [[Cab\u00e9car language|Cab\u00e9car]] (Talamanca) \u2013 8,800 speakers, vulnerable\n*** [[Teribe language|Teribe]] (Norte\u00f1o) \u2013 3,300 speakers, endangered\n* B\n** [[Paya language|Pech]] (Paya) \u2013 990 speakers, endangered\n** [[Dorasque language|Dorasque]] \u2020\n** [[Votic languages|Votic]]\n*** [[Rama language|Rama]] \u2013 740 speakers, moribund\n*** [[Voto language|Voto]] \u2020\n*** [[Mal\u00e9ku language|Mal\u00e9ku]] (Guatuso) \u2013 750 speakers, endangered\n*** [[Corobic\u00ed language|Corobic\u00ed]] \u2013 northwestern Costa Rica \u2020\n** Cuna\u2013Colombian\n*** [[Kuna language|Kuna]] (Dulegaya) \u2013 60,600 speakers, vulnerable in [[Panama]], endangered in [[Colombia]]\n*** Chibcha\u2013Motilon\n**** [[Bar\u00ed language|Bar\u00ed]] (Motil\u00f3n) \u2013 5,000 speakers, vulnerable\n**** Chibcha\u2013Tunebo\n***** [[Chibcha language|Chibcha]] \u2020\n***** [[Duit language|Duit]] (Muisca) \u2020\n***** [[Uwa language|U'wa]] (Tunebo) \u2013 2,550 speakers, endangered\n***** [[Guanes|Guane]] \u2020 \u2013 Colombia\n*** Arwako\u2013Chimila\n**** [[Chimila language|Chimila]] \u2013 350 speakers, endangered\n**** Arwako\n***** [[Wiwa language|Wiwa]] (Malayo, Guamaca) \u2013 1,850 speakers, endangered\n***** [[Kankuamo language|Kankuamo]] \u2020\n***** [[Arhuaco language|Arhuaco]] (Ika) \u2013 8,000 speakers, vulnerable\n***** [[Kogi language|Kogi]] ([[Cogui]]) \u2013 9,910 speakers, vulnerable\n\nThe extinct languages of [[Santa Fe de Antioquia|Antioquia]], [[Old Cat\u00edo]] and [[Nutabe language|Nutabe]] have been shown to be Chibchan (Adelaar & Muysken, 2004:49).
