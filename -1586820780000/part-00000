Universal Studios Japan in 2017|publisher=}}</ref> The previous attraction had closed on May 31, 2016. The ride film was reanimated in higher quality and with a higher aspect ratio through a fisheye lens to accommodate the IMAX dome screens from the previous ride. The most recent version of the ride opened in Universal Studios Japan on April 21, 2017 in the then-new Minion Park area. This ride boasts more content than the others, with a third pre-show video, a more immersive ride experience, and a wider field of view. The notable thing about the Japanese version of the ride is its lack of 3D goggles due to the new screens. As a result, all references to the goggles are edited out of the pre-show videos.\n\nOn May 7, 2019, Universal Parks announced that they have removed 3D from the attraction in Hollywood, removing the need for 3D glasses and converting the ride film to 2D. The preshow has also been modified, removing all mention of the 3D safety goggles. A few months later on July 18, 2019, Universal Parks announced that the Orlando version would follow suit and convert from 3-D to 2-D. In regards to the change, Universal has stated that they \"consistently evaluate and refine our guest experiences\", and \"are excited for guests to experience Despicable Me: Minion Mayhem this way\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.insideuniversal.net/2019/05/universal-parks-to-remove-3d-from-despicable-me-minion-mayhem-attractions/|title=Universal Parks to remove 3D from Despicable Me: Minion Mayhem attractions|publisher=Inside Universal|date=July 18, 2019|accessdate=July 20, 2019|first=Brian|last=Glenn}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n[[Universal Orlando Resort]] announced that the attraction is being designed by their [[Universal Creative]] company in association with [[Illumination Entertainment]] and ''Despicable Me'' film producer [[Chris Meledandri]]. The ride is a [[motion simulator]] and features multiple characters from the film, including Gru, Margo, Edith, Agnes and the [[Minions (Despicable Me)|Minions]].\n\nThe attraction at Universal Studios Florida is located in Soundstage 42 in the Production Central area. The soundstage previously housed [[The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera (ride)|The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera]] from 1990 until 2002 and [[Jimmy Neutron's Nicktoon Blast]] from 2003 until 2011.<ref name=\"Details distinguish Universal Studios' Despicable Me ride\">{{cite news|last=Bevil|first=Dewayne|title=Details distinguish Universal Studios' Despicable Me ride|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2012-07-05/travel/os-universal-studios-despicable-me-ride-20120705_1_jimmy-neutron-s-nicktoon-blast-universal-attraction-gru|accessdate=March 13, 2013|newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|date=July 5, 2012|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]}}</ref> The attraction at Universal Studios Hollywood is located on the former site of T2-3D: Battle Across Time on the Upper Lot. The attraction at Universal Studios Japan is located on the former site of Back to the Future: The Ride in the San Francisco area in a new area called Minion Park.<ref name=\"'Despicable Me' attraction coming to Universal Studios Hollywood\" /> The ride is also slated to open in 2021 at Universal Studios Singapore.\n\n===Experience===\n{{long plot|section|date=July 2015}}\n\n===='''Queue'''====\n===='''Universal Studios Florida:'''====\nGuests enter the queue for [['Despicable Me: Minion Mayhem']]\n\n====First pre-show room ''(Gru's living room)'' ====\nFirst, the guests enter the room. Then the pre-show starts with Gru, Margo, Edith, and Agnes, who welcome the guests to their house through a remote camera, and explain to them that they will be trained as minions. Gru tells guests what to expect during their time as Minions. Afterwards, Gru orders the guests to proceed to his lab just as the camera battery runs out. Then a voice tells the guests safety instructions (the Japan version and now the ride in Orlando also provides visual safety instructions on the monitors). Next, the doors open to Gru's laboratory with Gru explaining what to do while the guests enter the lab; the guests should stay in their row.\n\n====Second pre-show room ''(Gru's laboratory)'' ====\nIn this pre-show room, just before the ride, Gru, along with some Minions, enter the room and explains the public are there for a reason: henching for the world's #1 supervillain. Gru explains his newest scheme: turning human beings into Minions using a new device called the Minion Gun created by Doctor Nefario. Gru explains that there were a few snags in the initial Minionization test runs, and that all of the errors are eradicated, as far as the guests know. Next, the whole audience is given a routine body scan to make sure there are not any \"human germs\" in the lab by using high-density lasers. However, the scan is cut short due to a critical error: Gru becomes alarmed when the scan proves that some of the guests \"have not showered in like a week\", and he remarks on how gross that is. Luckily for the audience, Gru is in a bit of a time crunch and he warns the rest of the audience that he will hit them with his \"Pistola de peo\u201d (Spanish for \"fart gun\") if any of them are thinking of backing out of the process. A spotlight shines on the gun, which is mounted in the corner of the room. The Minions cry and beg that Gru doesn't hit them with the gun. However, at that moment, the girls show up, and Gru tells the audience to ignore them. Agnes and Margo start to explain to the audience that they should not be scared of Gru by calling him \"just a big, bald teddy bear\". Margo remarks that \u201cthere is no way he will shoot you with a Fart Gun\u201d, however she is proven to be wrong as Gru activates the Fart Gun, causing it to spray out into the audience. Everyone holds their breath, but Edith states that it actually released a banana scent. Upon hearing this, the Minions go crazy and start banging on the windows, much to Gru's dismay. Afterwards, Agnes wants to give a present to Gru. He states that he would love to accept it, but he needs her to wait, explaining that he is really behind schedule and has to train the public who are on the verge of becoming Minions. Margo eagerly asks Gru if the trio can assist him by training the guests: Gru thinks for a moment, but responds with: \"I do not think so.\" However, as Edith starts begging, Gru says that the training is very technical. It all becomes clear when Edith explains that their foster father has been reluctant for a while, not wanting to accept his daughters' willings. When Margo and Edith finally explain to Gru that the Minion training is \"not like it's rocket science, or even fourth grade science\" and that \"a trained monkey can do it,\" he agrees irate, calmly explaining to the audience that he will leave his daughters in charge of the training. Once Edith hears this, she explains to the guests that they \"are so doomed.\" Gru, however, orders the public to not listen to her, despite him saying that Edith might be right for once. He leaves the room and wishes the guests luck in their training, and at exactly the same time Agnes attempts to catch up with him to give him her anniversary gift of the girls\u2019 adoption. Edith, however, tells her that Gru already left, which filled Agnes with sorrow, causing her to realize that Gru may have forgotten the anniversary of their adoption. Margo explains to her that he has not, and that also they have an important job to do: transforming the audience into Minions and training them for Gru's bidding. Margo's determination to initiate the training causes Edith to be pumped up and say: \"Let's do this!\". After that, the doors to the ride are opened, the public is let through. In Japan, the guests wait in their rows until they are directed to their individual safety briefing rooms by a lab assistant.\n\n====Safety video/final preshow (''Japan only'')====\nOnce the riders are ushered into their holding rooms, the girls greet them and are amazed at how many people volunteered for \"Minion Training\". Edith worriedly remarks \u201cWoah. Someone should tell them what happened to the last bunch.\u201d Margo tells her to stop as Gru tells the guests that being a minion is serious business, and if they make it through training in one piece, they can do something fun, like get ice cream or watch a movie. Then he explains that because there was a high level of losses with previous recruits, he is being forced to show them a safety video. He hands it over to the girls who explain the safety rules, including not to eat or drink, secure all loose articles, etc. The Minions demonstrate these rules in a humorous manner as they're explained. After the video ends, Margo pleads for the audience to abide by the given rules & Agnes tells the guests to enjoy their new life as Minions. A recap of the rules is displayed on the screen as the guests are ushered into the garage/boarding area.\n\n====Ride====\n[[File:Despicable Me - Minion Mayhem, Universal Studios Hollywood.jpg|thumb|right|''Despicable Me Minion Mayhem'' at Universal Studios Hollywood]]\nWith a loud bang, the ride vehicle springs to life, shooting forward before rising up a huge tunnel. Lights turn on to reveal a bunch of Minions cheering the guests on and waving to them as they rise. At the top, the vehicle arrives at a conveyor belt and is pushed forward towards a large set of doors. Once the doors open, riders see Gru's daughters on a hovercraft (Japanese version only; the Hollywood and Florida versions have the doors open, revealing Gru's daughters zap the riders).\n\nOnce Edith orders Kevin the Minion to zap the riders, he pulls a lever which activates the Minion Gun, transforming the riders into Minions. Next, the riders get pushed down a long tube to training by the girls. Margo welcomes the guests to the Minion Training Grounds. The vehicle dives down a ramp alongside other Minions and launches over a ramp and straight into a corkscrew. As the vehicle slows down and returns to the upright position, Margo instructs the guests, stating that: \"This is where we test your \"strength, speed and ability to not die\". As the riders attempt to dodge the water sprayers, mist is sprayed on the audience from the ceiling as the sprayers are fired. The vehicle bounces off a trampoline and vaults onto a cactus, crushing a Minion in the process. Once they land, they are forced to dodge giant fly swatters, narrowly missing a few. The vehicle then dives through a laser maze simulation, only to get zapped at the end. A Minion gets zapped too and its skin puffs up, causing Agnes to scream \u201cHe\u2019s so fluffy!!\u201d The laser wears off and the vehicle brakes in front of a crowd of Minions holding \u201cStop\u201d signs. A huge boxing glove launches two Minions into a mattress, seemingly knocking them unconscious, and just when they think they're safe, another boxing glove launches into the car, sending two Minions flying alongside the vehicle as it is launched backwards, landing on a trapdoor that opens and sends the car down a pit, knocking over other Minions and coming to an abrupt stop at a chasm. This is where the girls put the recruits' problem solving and teamwork skills to the test; the latter are forced to create a huge, human hand-like Minion-chain to get across the other side. However, once Edith uses a huge banana as bait, the Minions get distracted by it. They erratically reach for the banana, jumping into the vehicle to grab it which causes the Minion-chain to break apart and the riders to unintentionally plummet down a long hole to the bomb transportation sector, which is a restricted area; Gru appears on a screen, questioning what the riders are doing in the restricted area. The cart brakes at another chasm where Margo states that \u201cwe\u2019ve gotta get you out of here\u201d, panicked, Suddenly, the worst happens: a bomb drops from a claw holder and explodes far below, starting a chain reaction which causes other bombs to explode in the bomb transportation room; when the girls get startled by the explosions, Agnes loses her gift and the guests attempt to retrieve it by plummeting into the abyss and dodging the bombs. The vehicle lands on a set of moving cogs, and the car narrowly misses a set of two buzzsaws. Agnes grabs the gift, but her celebration is cut short when a gust of wind shoots up from below, sending the gift and the vehicle flying into the air, hanging off a girder suspended in mid air. The gift rolls off the girder and falls down, with Agnes barely catching it. However, the vehicle lunges down into the conveyor belt below and causes multiple missiles to launch, with Kevin the Minion riding one into the sky. Gru arrives, attempting to catch the riders but a crowd of Minions send him rolling backwards on a missile. He falls into a vat of radioactive acid only to be nearly saved by grabbing onto the hovering vehicle that Margo, Edith and Agnes are riding. However, as Agnes is about to give her present to Gru, he gets unexpectedly knocked off the vehicle by a huge mallet unseen. He bounces off various objects before landing on a spring platform. The girls continue and fly out of harm's way, but as Gru remarks that he is okay, the platform activates and launches him upwards. As he falls back down, he gets hit by the mallet again and launched straight at the riders. The vehicle is pushed back past Kevin, who is still riding the rocket and screaming, and launches into the machine the girls are riding in. They get pushed off their vehicle and into another sector of the lab. Agnes grabs her gift as everything around them starts floating, making Margo realize that they are in the anti-gravity recycling room. To make matters worse, a huge robot arm rises from under and pushes the girls up towards a set of crushers. When this happens, Margo warns her younger siblings to just hold on to the robot arm. A large tremor causes the girls to grab hold of the arm. This shocks Agnes and causes her to let go of her gift, sending it floating into the crushers above. She panics and frees herself from Margo's grip to retrieve the gift, much to Margo's concern. As she attempts to float off to recover the gift, the riders narrowly avoid a bomb and the crushers. However, once Agnes recovers her present by barely avoiding a huge spiked crusher, she starts floating into a huge oscillating fan, when, all of a sudden, Gru arrives, blocking the crushers with a steel beam and saving Agnes. Seeing each other, Gru and Agnes hug when suddenly the crushers start moving again, leaving Gru no choice but to summon all of his strength to stop the huge crusher just in time, saving all of them, including himself, from being smashed. Because of Gru's strength and pressure that he used to both save Agnes and stop the huge crusher, the anti-gravity recycling room's power goes down, and the riders, along with Gru and his daughters, plummet towards the ground and land safely on a crowd of Minions. Once both the Gru residence and the guests land safely on the Minions, Gru opens Agnes' present, revealing a doll replica of himself. Despite it being \u201ca little squashed and burnt\", Gru finds it \"absolutely perfect\", and gives his daughters a hug, also gifting the trio with \u201ca little something\": an amusement park-like anniversary party, asking if they really thought he would forget the most important day of his life, the day he adopted his girls. Once the huge doors open to the party, the riders follow the Gru residence, now riding on a hovering vehicle, through the party. The vehicle plummets down a rollercoaster and crashes into the car ahead of them. They dodge various rides and decorations, knocking over a Minion and launching into the stage. Once there, Gru congratulates us of being successful in their training. However, Kevin arrives, riding the stray rocket from earlier. It is launched at the Minion Gun, right next to Gru however, the gun breaks and goes off on the riders, causing the effects to be reversed, transforming the guests into humans again. Once this happens, Gru gets disappointed, realizing the riders are \"human again,\" and he orders someone off-screen for the next troop. (This is where the ride ends in Orlando and Hollywood as the doors from the start close) The vehicle is pushed backwards and slowly lowers down through the same hole they came up through. Rainbow-coloured mist is sprayed which covers the vehicle as it reaches the bottom and the ride ends. Once the vehicle's doors open, guests exit the lab.\n\n====Post-show====\nAfter the ride (in Florida and Hollywood), the doors open to a dance party with the public dancing to \"[[Boogie Fever]],\" along with a costumed Minion. In Japan, the exit corridors are fitted with rainbow lights and 'Fun, Fun, Fun' plays as the guests exit down some ramps.<ref name=\"Details distinguish Universal Studios' Despicable Me ride\" />\n\n===Gift shop===\nIn May 2012, the ride's gift shop ''Super Silly Stuff'' opened at Universal Studios Florida,<ref name=\"Pictures: Universal Studios introduces SpongeBob StorePants and Super Silly Stuff (plus movement at Jaws)\" /> replacing the Nickstuff store. The Hollywood version opened in March 2014 replacing T2 Gear & Supply Co. The store sells ''Despicable Me''-related merchandise. The store is themed to the theme park Gru, Margo, Edith, and Agnes visited in the first ''Despicable Me'' film, Super Silly Fun Land. At Universal Studios Japan, an alternate version called the Minion Mart opened in mid 2015, replacing the Back to the Future Gifts store. However, this was closed and replaced by multiple other shops with the opening of Minion Park and the ride.\n\n===Special effects===\nAs well as the entire ride being a motion simulator, other physical effects are used. Mist and water are sprayed from the ceiling on to the audience during key points of the show, wind blows in riders' faces throughout the ride, and various light effects flash in sync with the action on the screen.\n\n==Voice cast==\n*[[Steve Carell]] as Gru\n*[[Miranda Cosgrove]] as Margo\n*[[Dana Gaier]] as Edith\n*[[Elsie Fisher]] as Agnes\n*[[Pierre Coffin]] as The [[Minions (Despicable Me)|Minions]]\nDr. Nefario appeared but had no lines.\n\n==Accolades==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+List of awards and nominations\n!

Universal Studios Japan in 2017|publisher=}}</ref> The previous attraction had closed on May 31, 2016. The ride film was reanimated in higher quality and with a higher aspect ratio through a fisheye lens to accommodate the IMAX dome screens from the previous ride. The most recent version of the ride opened in Universal Studios Japan on April 21, 2017 in the then-new Minion Park area. This ride boasts more content than the others, with a third pre-show video, a more immersive ride experience, and a wider field of view. The notable thing about the Japanese version of the ride is its lack of 3D goggles due to the new screens. As a result, all references to the goggles are edited out of the pre-show videos.\n\nOn May 7, 2019, Universal Parks announced that they have removed 3D from the attraction in Hollywood, removing the need for 3D glasses and converting the ride film to 2D. The preshow has also been modified, removing all mention of the 3D safety goggles. A few months later on July 18, 2019, Universal Parks announced that the Orlando version would follow suit and convert from 3-D to 2-D. In regards to the change, Universal has stated that they \"consistently evaluate and refine our guest experiences\", and \"are excited for guests to experience Despicable Me: Minion Mayhem this way\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.insideuniversal.net/2019/05/universal-parks-to-remove-3d-from-despicable-me-minion-mayhem-attractions/|title=Universal Parks to remove 3D from Despicable Me: Minion Mayhem attractions|publisher=Inside Universal|date=July 18, 2019|accessdate=July 20, 2019|first=Brian|last=Glenn}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n[[Universal Orlando Resort]] announced that the attraction is being designed by their [[Universal Creative]] company in association with [[Illumination Entertainment]] and ''Despicable Me'' film producer [[Chris Meledandri]].

Then a voice tells the guests safety instructions (the Japan version and now the ride in Orlando also provides visual safety instructions on the monitors). Next, the doors open to Gru's laboratory with Gru explaining what to do while the guests enter the lab; the guests should stay in their row.\n\n====Second pre-show room ''(Gru's laboratory)'' ====\nIn this pre-show room, just before the ride, Gru, along with some Minions, enter the room and explains the public are there for a reason: henching for the world's #1 supervillain. Gru explains his newest scheme: turning human beings into Minions using a new device called the Minion Gun created by Doctor Nefario. Gru explains that there were a few snags in the initial Minionization test runs, and that all of the errors are eradicated, as far as the guests know. Next, the whole audience is given a routine body scan to make sure there are not any \"human germs\" in the lab by using high-density lasers. However, the scan is cut short due to a critical error: Gru becomes alarmed when the scan proves that some of the guests \"have not showered in like a week\", and he remarks on how gross that is. Luckily for the audience, Gru is in a bit of a time crunch and he warns the rest of the audience that he will hit them with his \"Pistola de peo\u201d (Spanish for \"fart gun\") if any of them are thinking of backing out of the process. A spotlight shines on the gun, which is mounted in the corner of the room. The Minions cry and beg that Gru doesn't hit them with the gun. However, at that moment, the girls show up, and Gru tells the audience to ignore them. Agnes and Margo start to explain to the audience that they should not be scared of Gru by calling him \"just a big, bald teddy bear\". Margo remarks that \u201cthere is no way he will shoot you with a Fart Gun\u201d, however she is proven to be wrong as Gru activates the Fart Gun, causing it to spray out into the audience. Everyone holds their breath, but Edith states that it actually released a banana scent. Upon hearing this, the Minions go crazy and start banging on the windows, much to Gru's dismay. Afterwards, Agnes wants to give a present to Gru. He states that he would love to accept it, but he needs her to wait, explaining that he is really behind schedule and has to train the public who are on the verge of becoming Minions. Margo eagerly asks Gru if the trio can assist him by training the guests: Gru thinks for a moment, but responds with: \"I do not think so.\" However, as Edith starts begging, Gru says that the training is very technical. It all becomes clear when Edith explains that their foster father has been reluctant for a while, not wanting to accept his daughters' willings. When Margo and Edith finally explain to Gru that the Minion training is \"not like it's rocket science, or even fourth grade science\" and that \"a trained monkey can do it,\" he agrees irate, calmly explaining to the audience that he will leave his daughters in charge of the training. Once Edith hears this, she explains to the guests that they \"are so doomed.\" Gru, however, orders the public to not listen to her, despite him saying that Edith might be right for once. He leaves the room and wishes the guests luck in their training, and at exactly the same time Agnes attempts to catch up with him to give him her anniversary gift of the girls\u2019 adoption. Edith, however, tells her that Gru already left, which filled Agnes with sorrow, causing her to realize that Gru may have forgotten the anniversary of their adoption. Margo explains to her that he has not, and that also they have an important job to do: transforming the audience into Minions and training them for Gru's bidding. Margo's determination to initiate the training causes Edith to be pumped up and say: \"Let's do this!\". After that, the doors to the ride are opened, the public is let through. In Japan, the guests wait in their rows until they are directed to their individual safety briefing rooms by a lab assistant.\n\n====Safety video/final preshow (''Japan only'')====\nOnce the riders are ushered into their holding rooms, the girls greet them and are amazed at how many people volunteered for \"Minion Training\". Edith worriedly remarks \u201cWoah. Someone should tell them what happened to the last bunch.\u201d Margo tells her to stop as Gru tells the guests that being a minion is serious business, and if they make it through training in one piece, they can do something fun, like get ice cream or watch a movie. Then he explains that because there was a high level of losses with previous recruits, he is being forced to show them a safety video. He hands it over to the girls who explain the safety rules, including not to eat or drink, secure all loose articles, etc. The Minions demonstrate these rules in a humorous manner as they're explained. After the video ends, Margo pleads for the audience to abide by the given rules & Agnes tells the guests to enjoy their new life as Minions. A recap of the rules is displayed on the screen as the guests are ushered into the garage/boarding area.\n\n====Ride====\n[[File:Despicable Me - Minion Mayhem, Universal Studios Hollywood.jpg|thumb|right|''Despicable Me Minion Mayhem'' at Universal Studios Hollywood]]\nWith a loud bang, the ride vehicle springs to life, shooting forward before rising up a huge tunnel. Lights turn on to reveal a bunch of Minions cheering the guests on and waving to them as they rise. At the top, the vehicle arrives at a conveyor belt and is pushed forward towards a large set of doors. Once the doors open, riders see Gru's daughters on a hovercraft (Japanese version only; the Hollywood and Florida versions have the doors open, revealing Gru's daughters zap the riders).\n\nOnce Edith orders Kevin the Minion to zap the riders, he pulls a lever which activates the Minion Gun, transforming the riders into Minions. Next, the riders get pushed down a long tube to training by the girls. Margo welcomes the guests to the Minion Training Grounds. The vehicle dives down a ramp alongside other Minions and launches over a ramp and straight into a corkscrew. As the vehicle slows down and returns to the upright position, Margo instructs the guests, stating that: \"This is where we test your \"strength, speed and ability to not die\". As the riders attempt to dodge the water sprayers, mist is sprayed on the audience from the ceiling as the sprayers are fired. The vehicle bounces off a trampoline and vaults onto a cactus, crushing a Minion in the process. Once they land, they are forced to dodge giant fly swatters, narrowly missing a few. The vehicle then dives through a laser maze simulation, only to get zapped at the end. A Minion gets zapped too and its skin puffs up, causing Agnes to scream \u201cHe\u2019s so fluffy!!\u201d The laser wears off and the vehicle brakes in front of a crowd of Minions holding \u201cStop\u201d signs. A huge boxing glove launches two Minions into a mattress, seemingly knocking them unconscious, and just when they think they're safe, another boxing glove launches into the car, sending two Minions flying alongside the vehicle as it is launched backwards, landing on a trapdoor that opens and sends the car down a pit, knocking over other Minions and coming to an abrupt stop at a chasm. This is where the girls put the recruits' problem solving and teamwork skills to the test; the latter are forced to create a huge, human hand-like Minion-chain to get across the other side. However, once Edith uses a huge banana as bait, the Minions get distracted by it. They erratically reach for the banana, jumping into the vehicle to grab it which causes the Minion-chain to break apart and the riders to unintentionally plummet down a long hole to the bomb transportation sector, which is a restricted area; Gru appears on a screen, questioning what the riders are doing in the restricted area. The cart brakes at another chasm where Margo states that \u201cwe\u2019ve gotta get you out of here\u201d, panicked, Suddenly, the worst happens: a bomb drops from a claw holder and explodes far below, starting a chain reaction which causes other bombs to explode in the bomb transportation room; when the girls get startled by the explosions, Agnes loses her gift and the guests attempt to retrieve it by plummeting into the abyss and dodging the bombs. The vehicle lands on a set of moving cogs, and the car narrowly misses a set of two buzzsaws. Agnes grabs the gift, but her celebration is cut short when a gust of wind shoots up from below, sending the gift and the vehicle flying into the air, hanging off a girder suspended in mid air. The gift rolls off the girder and falls down, with Agnes barely catching it. However, the vehicle lunges down into the conveyor belt below and causes multiple missiles to launch, with Kevin the Minion riding one into the sky. Gru arrives, attempting to catch the riders but a crowd of Minions send him rolling backwards on a missile. He falls into a vat of radioactive acid only to be nearly saved by grabbing onto the hovering vehicle that Margo, Edith and Agnes are riding. However, as Agnes is about to give her present to Gru, he gets unexpectedly knocked off the vehicle by a huge mallet unseen. He bounces off various objects before landing on a spring platform. The girls continue and fly out of harm's way, but as Gru remarks that he is okay, the platform activates and launches him upwards. As he falls back down, he gets hit by the mallet again and launched straight at the riders. The vehicle is pushed back past Kevin, who is still riding the rocket and screaming, and launches into the machine the girls are riding in. They get pushed off their vehicle and into another sector of the lab. Agnes grabs her gift as everything around them starts floating, making Margo realize that they are in the anti-gravity recycling room. To make matters worse, a huge robot arm rises from under and pushes the girls up towards a set of crushers. When this happens, Margo warns her younger siblings to just hold on to the robot arm. A large tremor causes the girls to grab hold of the arm. This shocks Agnes and causes her to let go of her gift, sending it floating into the crushers above. She panics and frees herself from Margo's grip to retrieve the gift, much to Margo's concern. As she attempts to float off to recover the gift, the riders narrowly avoid a bomb and the crushers. However, once Agnes recovers her present by barely avoiding a huge spiked crusher, she starts floating into a huge oscillating fan, when, all of a sudden, Gru arrives, blocking the crushers with a steel beam and saving Agnes. Seeing each other, Gru and Agnes hug when suddenly the crushers start moving again, leaving Gru no choice but to summon all of his strength to stop the huge crusher just in time, saving all of them, including himself, from being smashed. Because of Gru's strength and pressure that he used to both save Agnes and stop the huge crusher, the anti-gravity recycling room's power goes down, and the riders, along with Gru and his daughters, plummet towards the ground and land safely on a crowd of Minions. Once both the Gru residence and the guests land safely on the Minions, Gru opens Agnes' present, revealing a doll replica of himself. Despite it being \u201ca little squashed and burnt\", Gru finds it \"absolutely perfect\", and gives his daughters a hug, also gifting the trio with \u201ca little something\": an amusement park-like anniversary party, asking if they really thought he would forget the most important day of his life, the day he adopted his girls. Once the huge doors open to the party, the riders follow the Gru residence, now riding on a hovering vehicle, through the party. The vehicle plummets down a rollercoaster and crashes into the car ahead of them. They dodge various rides and decorations, knocking over a Minion and launching into the stage. Once there, Gru congratulates us of being successful in their training. However, Kevin arrives, riding the stray rocket from earlier. It is launched at the Minion Gun, right next to Gru however, the gun breaks and goes off on the riders, causing the effects to be reversed, transforming the guests into humans again. Once this happens, Gru gets disappointed, realizing the riders are \"human again,\" and he orders someone off-screen for the next troop. (This is where the ride ends in Orlando and Hollywood as the doors from the start close) The vehicle is pushed backwards and slowly lowers down through the same hole they came up through. Rainbow-coloured mist is sprayed which covers the vehicle as it reaches the bottom and the ride ends. Once the vehicle's doors open, guests exit the lab.\n\n====Post-show====\nAfter the ride (in Florida and Hollywood), the doors open to a dance party with the public dancing to \"[[Boogie Fever]],\" along with a costumed Minion. In Japan, the exit corridors are fitted with rainbow lights and 'Fun, Fun, Fun' plays as the guests exit down some ramps.<ref name=\"Details distinguish Universal Studios' Despicable Me ride\" />\n\n===Gift shop===\nIn May 2012, the ride's gift shop ''Super Silly Stuff'' opened at Universal Studios Florida,<ref name=\"Pictures: Universal Studios introduces SpongeBob StorePants and Super Silly Stuff (plus movement at Jaws)\" /> replacing the Nickstuff store. The Hollywood version opened in March 2014 replacing T2 Gear & Supply Co. The store sells ''Despicable Me''-related merchandise. The store is themed to the theme park Gru, Margo, Edith, and Agnes visited in the first ''Despicable Me'' film, Super Silly Fun Land. At Universal Studios Japan, an alternate version called the Minion Mart opened in mid 2015, replacing the Back to the Future Gifts store. However, this was closed and replaced by multiple other shops with the opening of Minion Park and the ride.\n\n===Special effects===\nAs well as the entire ride being a motion simulator, other physical effects are used. Mist and water are sprayed from the ceiling on to the audience during key points of the show, wind blows in riders' faces throughout the ride, and various light effects flash in sync with the action on the screen.\n\n==Voice cast==\n*[[Steve Carell]] as Gru\n*[[Miranda Cosgrove]] as Margo\n*[[Dana Gaier]] as Edith\n*[[Elsie Fisher]] as Agnes\n*[[Pierre Coffin]] as The [[Minions (Despicable Me)|Minions]]\nDr. Nefario appeared but had no lines.\n\n==Accolades==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+List of awards and nominations\n!

The story unfolds in the picturesque township in Lucknow where a Brahmin's son Abeer falls for a Kayastha's daughter Leher. The show portrays the often heard though never-seen-before love story of people from different castes battling their own families and the society in order to unite. The story plays on the popular adage, 'Love is blind' but is also a scathing critique on our country's obsession with caste and class.\n\nAbeer Bajpayee comes from a very wealthy family and being the family's only son gives him the benefit of being the apple of everyone's eyes. He is a student at the local university pursuing a degree in law so that he can follow his father's footsteps. Everybody likes to follow Abeer because he is popular.\n\nThe Bajpayees have a Kayasth family, the Mathurs, as their neighbor. There is a rift between both the families because of a building construction (common wall) problem, while building their houses. Mr. Kulbhushan Mathur and his family is delighted to receive his elder brother, Mr. Brijbhushan Mathur, who works in the electricity department and is transferred to Lucknow. Brijbhushan is accompanied by his wife (played by [[Prachi Shah]]) whom he lovingly calls 'Dulhan' and his two daughters, Guddan (Leher) and Bittan.\n\nAbeer sees Leher when she is moving her luggage from the truck into the house and is attracted towards her. He even helps her unload the truck without her taking any notice and while helping her, he picks up her payal which falls to the ground in the rush and keeps it with him. He is really smitten by her and tries to talk to her so that he can know her name but she only brushes him away whenever he tries to even attempt to talk to her. She even doesn't tell him her name, until he knows it from Bittan. Abeer helps Leher's family with a lot of things much to the dislike of his family thereby creating a rift between him and his family. After a lot of drama, Abeer and Leher marry each other and the show progresses.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gaurav Khanna]] as Abeer Bajpayee\n* [[Yami Gautam]] as Leher Mathur / Guddan (Leher Bajpayee after marrying Abeer)\n* [[Parul Gulati]] as Bittan\n* [[Bhupinder Singh (actor) |Bhupinder Singh]] as Triyogi Narayan Bajpayee (Abeer's father)\n* Aishwarya Narkar as Sudha Triyogi Narayan Bajpayee\n* [[Prachi Shah]] / Shweta Gautam as Mridula Mathur (Leher and Bittan's mother)\n* Meeankshi Verma as Dadi\n* Rajveer Singh Palawat as Banke\n* [[Tushar Dalvi]] as Brijbhushan Mathur (Leher and Bittan's father)\n* [[Rohitash Gaud]] as Kulbhushan Mathur (Brijbhushan's younger brother)\n* Akhlaque Khan as Ankur Mathur (Kulbhushan's son)\n* Indu Verma as Rama Mathur\n* Puneet Tejwani as Madhav Shukla\n* [[Amit Behl]] as Mr. Shukla (Madhav's father)\n* [[Nupur Alankar]] as Mrs.Shukla (Madhav's mother)\n* [[Chandan K Anand]] as Omi (The college goon)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://epaper.hindustantimes.com/ArticleImage.aspx?article=30_01_2010_550_002&mode=1 News Article on Yeh Pyar Na Hoga Kam]\n* [http://yehpyaarnahogakam.blogspot.com/2009/12/yeh-pyaar-na-hoga-kam-to-replace-bigg.html Yeh Pyar Na Hoga Kam to replace Bigg Boss 3]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100110054635/http://entertainment.in.msn.com/tv/article.aspx?cp-documentid=3303966 Indu Verma in Yeh Pyar Na Hoga Kam]\n* [http://colorstv.in/show/yeh-pyaar-na-hoga-kam Yeh Pyar Na Hoga Kam, website] at [[Colors (TV channel)|Colors]]\n\n{{Colors Programmes}}\n\n[[Category:Colors (TV channel) series]]\n[[Category:Indian drama television series]]\n[[Category:Indian television soap operas]]\n[[Category:2009 Indian television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2010 Indian television series endings]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Indian English|date=May 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2015}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name            = Yeh Pyar Na Hoga Kam\n| image                = http://s899.photobucket.com/user/GauravKhanna/media/YehPyarNaHogaKam.jpg.html\n| caption              = ''Yeh Pyar Na Hoga Kam'' Title card\n| genre                = [[Drama]]\n| creator              = COLORS Creative Team\n| developer            = Deepak Panth\n| writer               = Rajita Sharma\n| director             = Nitin jindal,<br>Sunand Baranwal\n| creative_director    = Rajita Sharma <br> Shantanu Agrawal\n| starring             = <br>[[Yami Gautam]]<br>[[Gaurav Khanna]]\n| theme_music_composer = \n| opentheme            = \"Yeh Pyar Na Hoga Kam\" \n| voices               =  Harshwardhan Dixit\n| country              = [[India]]\n| language             = [[Hindi language|Hindi]]\n| num_seasons          = 01\n| num_episodes         = 161\n| executive_producer   = \n| producer             = Dheeraj Kumar <br> Zuby Kochchar\n| editor               = Rochak Ahuja\n| location             = Mumbai\n| cinematography       = \n| camera               = [[Multi-camera]]\n| runtime              = Approx. 24 minutes\n| company              = [[Creative Eye Limited]]\n| channel              = [[Viacom 18|Colors TV]]\n| picture_format       = [[576i]] ([[SDTV]])\n| first_aired          = {{start date|df=yes|2009|12|28}}\n| last_aired           = {{end date|df=yes|2010|9|2}}\n| website              = \n}}\n\n'''''Yeh Pyar Na Hoga Kam''''' (English: ''This Love Will Not Diminish'') was an Indian television series starring [[Yami Gautam]] which aired on the [[Colors (TV channel)|Colors]] channel Monday - Thursday at 9pm [[Indian Standard Time|IST]].

He married Hon. Letitia Coote, daughter of [[Richard Coote, 1st Baron Coote]], and Mary St. George. His father Robert (d. 1656) was a [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwellian]] who made a fortune in [[Dublin]], largely by provisioning Cromwell's army; Robert Molesworth the younger supported [[William III of England|William of Orange]] and was made William's ambassador to [[Denmark]]. In 1695 he became a prominent member of the [[Privy Council of Ireland]]. The same year he stood for [[Dublin County (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Dublin County]] in the [[Irish House of Commons]], a seat he held until 1703. Subsequently, he represented [[Swords (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Swords]] until 1715. In the following year, he was created '''Viscount Molesworth''', of Swords, in the [[Peerage of Ireland]].\n\nMolesworth's ''An Account of Denmark, as it was in the Year 1692'' (published 1694) was somewhat influential in  the burgeoning field of [[political science]] in the period.  He made a case for comparative political analysis, comparing the political situation of a country to the health of an individual; a disease, he reasoned, can only be diagnosed by comparing it to its instantiation in other people (Thompson, 495).\n\n==Life and career==\n\nRobert Molesworth was born two days after his fathers' death on 9 September 1656; his mother Judith Bysse later remarried Sir William Tichborne of Beaulieu. He was probably raised by his mothers' family, the Bysses,  at [[Brackenstown]], near [[Swords, County Dublin]].  His grandfather, [[John Bysse]], was an eminent lawyer who became  [[Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer]] under [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]. In 1675, Robert graduated from [[Trinity College, Dublin]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]]. On 15 August 1676, shortly before his 20th birthday, he was married in Dublin to Letitia Coote, third daughter of Richard Coote (1620\u20131683), 1st Baron Coote of  Colooney, and Mary St. George, daughter of George St. George, Deputy Admiral of [[Connacht|Connaught]].  Letitia's brother [[Richard Coote, 1st Earl of Bellomont|Richard]]   was created [[Earl of Bellomont]] and served as Governor of [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Massachusetts]] and [[New Hampshire]] for [[William III of England|William III]] from 1697 until his sudden death in 1701. Robert and Letitia Molesworth subsequently settled at the [[Bysse]] family seat, Brackenstown House, where according to a letter of 1721 Letitia bore seventeen children, nine of whom were still living at the time.\n\nOn 7 May 1689, young Molesworth, an active supporter of the Williamites, was attainted by King [[James II of England|James II's]] Catholic-dominated [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]]. His estate, valued at \u00a32825 per annum, was duly confiscated. James had succeeded his brother Charles II as king of England, Ireland and Scotland early in 1685. Although initially fearful of alienating English and Irish Protestant opinion, James came under the influence of the Catholic [[Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell]] and determined to make the island of Ireland a Catholic stronghold. Tyrconnell also secured the king's agreement to revise the [[Act of Settlement 1662|1662 Act of Settlement]], which had confirmed many of the leading [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwellian]] planters in their estates. Over the course of the next two years, war raged across Ireland between the rival armies of James II and the Dutch Protestant, William of Orange, who was invited to take the throne of England by the Parliament in 1688. The decisive victory of the Williamite forces at the [[battle of the Boyne]] in 1690, and the [[battle of Aughrim]] in 1691, confirmed the new Protestant monarchy and finally secured New English interests in Ireland. The age of the Protestant Ascendancy had begun.\n\nRobert Molesworth, an ardent [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]], became a prominent figure in the new Williamite administration. Contemporaries acknowledged his opinions on politics and economy with considerable respect. From July 1689 to December 1692 he served as British Ambassador to the Court of [[Denmark\u2013Norway|Denmark]], during which time he wrote a spirited attack on [[Danish absolutism]] in a treatise entitled ''An Account of Denmark as it was in the Year 1692''.  From 1695 to 1698 he stood as Whig MP in both the English and Irish Parliaments, representing [[Camelford (UK Parliament constituency)|Camelford]] and [[Dublin City (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Dublin City]] respectively. In August 1697, he was appointed to the Irish Privy Council, an effective cabinet charged with the governance of Ireland and the introduction of the \"Penal Laws\".  From 1703 to 1715 he represented Swords as MP in the Irish Parliament.  Between November 1714 and December 1715 he served in the fruitful post of [[Commissioner of Trade and Plantations]].\n\nOn 16 July 1716, Robert was advanced to the Irish peerage as Baron of [[Phillipstown, Ireland|Phillipstown]] and Viscount Molesworth of Swords \"in reward for his steadfast adherence to the House of Hanover\". He took his seat as such on 1 July 1719. In his later years he established the \"Molesworth Circle\", a group of eminent scientists, philosophers and thinkers who met at Brackenstown and are said to have introduced the spread of \"politeness\" in 18th century Ireland. Other members of this Whig-minded intellectual circle included [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury]], [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]], [[James Arbuckle]], [[John Toland]] and [[Jonathan Swift]]. Molesworth's pamphlet ''Considerations on the Agriculture and Employment of the Poor of Ireland'' prompted Swift to address the last of his celebrated Drapier's Letters to Molesworth in 1724.\n\nWhen the so-called [[South Sea Bubble]] burst in 1720, the 1st Viscount was perhaps the most vehement of those seeking vengeance against the company directors. He and his grandson, Robert Molesworth, had invested heavily in the company. He advised that, as no law existed for punishing such companies, the government \"ought upon this occasion follow the example of the ancient Romans, who, having no law against parricide, because their legislators supposed no son could be so unnaturally wicked as to embrue his hands in his father's blood, made a law to punish this heinous crime as soon as it was committed. They adjudged the guilty wretch to be sewn into a sack and thrown alive into the Tiber\". The Whig statesman declared that he would be quite \"satisfied to see [the South-Sea Company directors] tied in like manner in sacks, and thrown into the Thames.\"\n\n==Family==\n\nWith his wife Letitia, Molesworth had eleven sons and six daughters:<ref>[https://anaccountofdenmark.wordpress.com/children-of-the-1st-viscount/ Children of the 1st Viscount Molesworth] - William Molesworth, MA (Cantab), MLitt (Dub)</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/stream/genealogicalhera00inburk#page/776/mode/2up A Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary of the Peerage and Baronetage of the British Empire], by Sir Bernard Burke. 1869 Edition, published by Harrison, 59 Pall Mall.</ref>\n[[File:Molesworth.jpg|thumb|upright|Robert  Molesworth's  direct descendant [[Guilford Lindsey Molesworth|Sir Guilford Lindsey Molesworth]] (d.1925)]]\n* John Molesworth, 2nd Viscount Molesworth of Swords (4 December 1679 -  17th or 18 February 1725/26).

He married Hon. Letitia Coote, daughter of [[Richard Coote, 1st Baron Coote]], and Mary St. George. His father Robert (d. 1656) was a [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwellian]] who made a fortune in [[Dublin]], largely by provisioning Cromwell's army; Robert Molesworth the younger supported [[William III of England|William of Orange]] and was made William's ambassador to [[Denmark]]. In 1695 he became a prominent member of the [[Privy Council of Ireland]]. The same year he stood for [[Dublin County (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Dublin County]] in the [[Irish House of Commons]], a seat he held until 1703. Subsequently, he represented [[Swords (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Swords]] until 1715. In the following year, he was created '''Viscount Molesworth''', of Swords, in the [[Peerage of Ireland]].\n\nMolesworth's ''An Account of Denmark, as it was in the Year 1692'' (published 1694) was somewhat influential in  the burgeoning field of [[political science]] in the period.  He made a case for comparative political analysis, comparing the political situation of a country to the health of an individual; a disease, he reasoned, can only be diagnosed by comparing it to its instantiation in other people (Thompson, 495).\n\n==Life and career==\n\nRobert Molesworth was born two days after his fathers' death on 9 September 1656; his mother Judith Bysse later remarried Sir William Tichborne of Beaulieu. He was probably raised by his mothers' family, the Bysses,  at [[Brackenstown]], near [[Swords, County Dublin]].  His grandfather, [[John Bysse]], was an eminent lawyer who became  [[Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer]] under [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]. In 1675, Robert graduated from [[Trinity College, Dublin]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]]. On 15 August 1676, shortly before his 20th birthday, he was married in Dublin to Letitia Coote, third daughter of Richard Coote (1620\u20131683), 1st Baron Coote of  Colooney, and Mary St. George, daughter of George St. George, Deputy Admiral of [[Connacht|Connaught]].  Letitia's brother [[Richard Coote, 1st Earl of Bellomont|Richard]]   was created [[Earl of Bellomont]] and served as Governor of [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Massachusetts]] and [[New Hampshire]] for [[William III of England|William III]] from 1697 until his sudden death in 1701. Robert and Letitia Molesworth subsequently settled at the [[Bysse]] family seat, Brackenstown House, where according to a letter of 1721 Letitia bore seventeen children, nine of whom were still living at the time.\n\nOn 7 May 1689, young Molesworth, an active supporter of the Williamites, was attainted by King [[James II of England|James II's]] Catholic-dominated [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]]. His estate, valued at \u00a32825 per annum, was duly confiscated. James had succeeded his brother Charles II as king of England, Ireland and Scotland early in 1685. Although initially fearful of alienating English and Irish Protestant opinion, James came under the influence of the Catholic [[Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell]] and determined to make the island of Ireland a Catholic stronghold. Tyrconnell also secured the king's agreement to revise the [[Act of Settlement 1662|1662 Act of Settlement]], which had confirmed many of the leading [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwellian]] planters in their estates. Over the course of the next two years, war raged across Ireland between the rival armies of James II and the Dutch Protestant, William of Orange, who was invited to take the throne of England by the Parliament in 1688. The decisive victory of the Williamite forces at the [[battle of the Boyne]] in 1690, and the [[battle of Aughrim]] in 1691, confirmed the new Protestant monarchy and finally secured New English interests in Ireland. The age of the Protestant Ascendancy had begun.\n\nRobert Molesworth, an ardent [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]], became a prominent figure in the new Williamite administration. Contemporaries acknowledged his opinions on politics and economy with considerable respect. From July 1689 to December 1692 he served as British Ambassador to the Court of [[Denmark\u2013Norway|Denmark]], during which time he wrote a spirited attack on [[Danish absolutism]] in a treatise entitled ''An Account of Denmark as it was in the Year 1692''.  From 1695 to 1698 he stood as Whig MP in both the English and Irish Parliaments, representing [[Camelford (UK Parliament constituency)|Camelford]] and [[Dublin City (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Dublin City]] respectively. In August 1697, he was appointed to the Irish Privy Council, an effective cabinet charged with the governance of Ireland and the introduction of the \"Penal Laws\".  From 1703 to 1715 he represented Swords as MP in the Irish Parliament.  Between November 1714 and December 1715 he served in the fruitful post of [[Commissioner of Trade and Plantations]].\n\nOn 16 July 1716, Robert was advanced to the Irish peerage as Baron of [[Phillipstown, Ireland|Phillipstown]] and Viscount Molesworth of Swords \"in reward for his steadfast adherence to the House of Hanover\". He took his seat as such on 1 July 1719. In his later years he established the \"Molesworth Circle\", a group of eminent scientists, philosophers and thinkers who met at Brackenstown and are said to have introduced the spread of \"politeness\" in 18th century Ireland. Other members of this Whig-minded intellectual circle included [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury]], [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]], [[James Arbuckle]], [[John Toland]] and [[Jonathan Swift]]. Molesworth's pamphlet ''Considerations on the Agriculture and Employment of the Poor of Ireland'' prompted Swift to address the last of his celebrated Drapier's Letters to Molesworth in 1724.\n\nWhen the so-called [[South Sea Bubble]] burst in 1720, the 1st Viscount was perhaps the most vehement of those seeking vengeance against the company directors. He and his grandson, Robert Molesworth, had invested heavily in the company. He advised that, as no law existed for punishing such companies, the government \"ought upon this occasion follow the example of the ancient Romans, who, having no law against parricide, because their legislators supposed no son could be so unnaturally wicked as to embrue his hands in his father's blood, made a law to punish this heinous crime as soon as it was committed. They adjudged the guilty wretch to be sewn into a sack and thrown alive into the Tiber\". The Whig statesman declared that he would be quite \"satisfied to see [the South-Sea Company directors] tied in like manner in sacks, and thrown into the Thames.\"\n\n==Family==\n\nWith his wife Letitia, Molesworth had eleven sons and six daughters:<ref>[https://anaccountofdenmark.wordpress.com/children-of-the-1st-viscount/ Children of the 1st Viscount Molesworth] - William Molesworth, MA (Cantab), MLitt (Dub)</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/stream/genealogicalhera00inburk#page/776/mode/2up A Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary of the Peerage and Baronetage of the British Empire], by Sir Bernard Burke. 1869 Edition, published by Harrison, 59 Pall Mall.</ref>\n[[File:Molesworth.jpg|thumb|upright|Robert  Molesworth's  direct descendant [[Guilford Lindsey Molesworth|Sir Guilford Lindsey Molesworth]] (d.1925)]]\n* John Molesworth, 2nd Viscount Molesworth of Swords (4 December 1679 -  17th or 18 February 1725/26).
