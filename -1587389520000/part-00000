During the high-water mark of Pickett's charge on 3 July 1863 the colors of the 14th Tennessee Infantry C.S.A. were planted 50 yards in front of the center of Sergeant Major Hincks' regiment. There were no Confederates standing near it but several were lying down around it. \"Major Ellis called for volunteers to capture the flag and instantly Major Hincks, Major Broatch and Lieutenant Brigham leaped the wall. Brigham was shot down by a retreating rebel, but the other two sped on, Hincks finally outstripping Broatch ran straight and swift for the color, amid a storm of shot. Swinging his saber over the prostrate Confederates and uttering a terrific yell, he seized the flag and hastily returned to the line.\" <ref name=Page />{{rp|154}}\n\nThe 14th Tennessee carried 12 battle honors on its flag.

Hincks, United States Army, for extraordinary heroism on 3 July 1863, while serving with 14th Connecticut Infantry, in action at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. During the high-water mark of Pickett's charge on 3 July 1863 the colors of the 14th Tennessee Infantry C.S.A. were planted 50 yards in front of the center of Sergeant Major Hincks' regiment. There were no Confederates standing near it but several were lying down around it. \"Major Ellis called for volunteers to capture the flag and instantly Major Hincks, Major Broatch and Lieutenant Brigham leaped the wall. Brigham was shot down by a retreating rebel, but the other two sped on, Hincks finally outstripping Broatch ran straight and swift for the color, amid a storm of shot. Swinging his saber over the prostrate Confederates and uttering a terrific yell, he seized the flag and hastily returned to the line.\" <ref name=Page />{{rp|154}}\n\nThe 14th Tennessee carried 12 battle honors on its flag. The devotion to duty shown by Sergeant Major Hincks gave encouragement to many of his comrades at a crucial moment of the battle.\n\n==Corporal Joseph Pierce==\n\n{{Empty section|date=October 2019}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Connecticut Civil War units]]\n\n==References==\n* Page, Charles D.

His father was a [[novelist]], [[critic]], and [[screenwriter]]. Two documentary films by [[Bert Haanstra]] for which his father wrote the scenarios were nominated for an [[Academy Award for Documentary Feature]], one won a [[Golden Bear (award)|Golden Bear]] for Short Film. His maternal grandfather, [[Dirk Roosenburg]] (1887\u20131962), was a [[Modern architecture|modernist architect]] who worked for [[Hendrik Petrus Berlage]], before opening his own practice. Rem Koolhaas has a brother, Thomas, and a sister, Annabel. His paternal cousin was the architect and urban planner [[Teun Koolhaas]] (1940\u20132007). The family lived consecutively in Rotterdam (until 1946), [[Amsterdam]] (1946\u20131952), [[Jakarta]] (1952\u20131955), and Amsterdam (from 1955).<ref>{{cite web\n  | last = Moor\n  | first = Wam de\n  | title = Koolhaas, Anthonie (1912\u20131992)\n  | work = Biografisch Woordenboek van Nederland\n  | publisher = Instituut voor Nederlandse Geschiedenis\n  | date = 13 March 2008\n  | url = http://www.inghist.nl/Onderzoek/Projecten/BWN/lemmata/bwn5/koolhaas\n  | accessdate = 14 May 2008 |language=nl}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Anthonie Koolhaas |work=De [[Boekenweek]] |url=http://www.schenkt.nl/Biografieen/koolhaas.htm |accessdate=14 May 2008 |language=nl |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201101236/http://www.schenkt.nl/Biografieen/koolhaas.htm |archivedate=1 December 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n  | last = Anker\n  | first = Eva van den\n  | title = Dirk Roosenburg\n  | work = Archipedia\n  | publisher = Architectenweb\n  | url = http://www.architectenweb.nl/aweb/archipedia/archipedia.asp?ID=789\n  | accessdate = 14 May 2008 |language=nl}}</ref>\n\nHis father strongly supported the Indonesian cause for autonomy from the colonial Dutch in his writing.

They were later joined by one of Koolhaas's students, [[Zaha Hadid]] \u2013 who would soon go on to achieve success in her own right. An early work which would mark their difference from the then dominant [[postmodern]] classicism of the late 1970s, was their contribution to the [[Venice Biennale]] of 1980, curated by Italian architect [[Paolo Portoghesi]], titled \"Presence of the Past\". Each architect had to design a stage-like \"frontage\" to a [[Potemkin village|Potemkin]]-type internal street; the fa\u00e7ades by {{Interlanguage link multi|Costantino Dardi|it}}, [[Frank Gehry]] and OMA were the only ones that did not employ [[Post-Modern]] architecture motifs or historical references.\n\nOther early critically received (yet unbuilt) projects included the [[Parc de la Villette]], Paris (1982) and the residence for the [[Taoiseach|Prime Minister of Ireland]] (1979), as well as the [[Kunsthal]] in Rotterdam (1992). These schemes would attempt to put into practice many of the findings Koolhaas made in his book ''Delirious New York'' (1978),<ref>Koolhaas, Rem (1978) ''Delirious New York: A retroactive Manifesto for Manhattan'', Academy Editions, London; republished, The Monacelli Press, 1994, {{ISBN|1885254008}}</ref> which was written while he was a visiting scholar at the [[Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies]] in New York, directed by [[Peter Eisenman]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Valentina|last=Ciuffi|title=Rem Koolhaas is stating 'the end' of his career, says Peter Eisenman|date=2014-06-09|url=https://www.dezeen.com/2014/06/09/rem-koolhaas-at-the-end-of-career-says-peter-eisenman/|website=dezeen.com|accessdate=2019-08-07}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2006, Rem Koolhaas was commissioned to develop [[111 First Street]] in [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]] across the [[Hudson River]] from [[Manhattan]], working with real estate developer [[Louis Dubin]].<ref name=tws2nov16>{{cite news\n |title        = Rem Koolhaas Commissioned for Development of 111 First Street in Jersey City, N.J.\n |quote        = ...the commissioning of The Office for Metropolitan Architecture (OMA) of Rem Koolhaas, an internationally renowned architect, for development of 111 First St., in Jersey City, N.J.\n |publisher    = BlueVerticalStudio\n |date         = 18 September 2006\n |url          = http://www.blueverticalstudio.com/go/?p=1988\n |accessdate   = 2 November 2009\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20071211011055/http://blueverticalstudio.com/go/?p=1988\n |archive-date = 11 December 2007\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2008, Rem Koolhaas was invited for a European \"group of the wise\" under the chairmanship of former Spanish prime minister [[Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez]] to help 'design' the future [[European Union]].

Koolhaas analyzes the \"chance-like\" nature of city life: \"The City is an addictive machine from which there is no escape\" \"Rem Koolhaas...defined the city as a collection of \u201cred hot spots.\u201d<ref>Klingmann, A (2007) ''Brandscapes: Architecture in the Experience Economy''. Mit Press, {{ISBN|0262515032}}</ref> ([[Anna Klingmann]]).  As Koolhaas himself has acknowledged, this approach had already been evident in the Japanese [[Metabolist Movement]] in the 1960s and early 1970s.\n[[File:Seattle Central Library by architect Rem Koolhaas, view from 5th Ave.jpg|thumb|[[Seattle Central Library]] Seattle, USA, designed by [[Office for Metropolitan Architecture|OMA]]]]\nA key aspect of architecture that Koolhaas interrogates is the \"[[brief (architecture)|Program]]\": with the rise of modernism in the 20th century the \"Program\" became the key theme of architectural design. The notion of the Program involves \"an act to edit function and human activities\" as the pretext of architectural design: epitomised in the maxim [[form follows function]], first popularised by architect [[Louis Henri Sullivan|Louis Sullivan]] at the beginning of the 20th century. The notion was first questioned in ''Delirious New York'', in his analysis of high-rise architecture in Manhattan. An early design method derived from such thinking was \"cross-programming\", introducing unexpected functions in room programmes, such as running tracks in skyscrapers. More recently, Koolhaas unsuccessfully proposed the inclusion of hospital units for the homeless into the Seattle Public Library project (2003).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.archdaily.com/449282/happy-birthday-rem-koolhaas-2|title=Spotlight: Rem Koolhaas|date=17 November 2018|website=ArchDaily}}</ref>\n\n===S,M,L,XL===\nThe next landmark publication by Koolhaas was ''[[S,M,L,XL]]'', together with [[Bruce Mau]], [[Jennifer Sigler]], and [[Hans Werlemann]] (1995),<ref>Koolhaas, Rem; Werlemann, Hans and Mau, Bruce (1994) ''S,M,L,XL'', The Monacelli Press, New York, (2nd edition 1998) {{ISBN|1885254865}}</ref> a 1376-page tome combining essays, manifestos, diaries, fiction, travelogues, and meditations on the contemporary city. The layout of the huge book transformed architectural publishing, and such books\u2014full-colour graphics and dense texts\u2014have since become common. Ostensibly, ''S,M,L,XL'' gives a record of the actual implementation of \"Manhattanism\" throughout the various (mostly unrealized) projects and texts OMA had generated up to that time. The part lexicon-type layout (with a marginal \"dictionary\" composed by [[Jennifer Sigler]], who also edited the book) spawned a number of concepts that have become common in later architectural theory, in particular \"Bigness\": 'old' architectural principles (composition, scale, proportion, detail) no longer apply when a building acquires Bigness. This was demonstrated in OMA's scheme for the development of \"[[Euralille]]\" (1990\u201394), a new centre for the city of [[Lille]] in France, a city returned to prominence by its position on the new rail route from Paris to London via the [[Channel Tunnel]]. OMA sited a train station, two centres for commerce and trade, an urban park, and 'Congrexpo' ([[:fr:Lille Grand Palais|Lille Grand Palais]], a contemporary \"[[Grand Palais]]\" with a large concert hall, three auditoria and an exhibition space) with [[Cecil Balmond]]. In another essay in the book, titled \"The Generic City\", Koolhaas declares that progress, identity, architecture, the city and the street are things of the past: \u201cRelief \u2026 it\u2019s over. That is the story of the city. The city is no longer. We can leave the theatre now...\u201d\n\n===Project on the city===\n[[File:Be Dutch Embassy 01.JPG|thumb|[[Embassy of the Netherlands, Berlin]], Germany, opened in 2004. Koolhaas's design won the [[Architekturpreis Berlin]] in 2003 and the [[Mies van der Rohe Award for European Architecture]] in 2005.]]\n\nKoolhaas's next landmark publications were a product of his position as professor at [[Harvard University]], in the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design|Design school]]'s \"Project on the City\"; firstly the 720-page ''Mutations'',<ref>Koolhaas, Rem ''et al.'' (2001) ''Mutations'', Arc en r\u00eave centre d\u2019architecture, Bordeaux, {{ISBN|84-95273-51-9}}.</ref> followed by ''The Harvard Design School Guide to Shopping'' (2002)<ref>Koolhaas, Rem; Chung, Chuihua Judy; Inaba, Jeffrey and Leong, Sze Tsung (2002) ''The Harvard Design School Guide to Shopping. Harvard Design School Project on the City 2'', Taschen, New York, {{ISBN|3822860476}}</ref> and ''The Great Leap Forward'' (2002).<ref>Koolhaas, Rem ''et al.'' (2002) ''The Great Leap Forward. Harvard Design School Project on the City'', Taschen, New York, {{ISBN|3822860484}}</ref> All three books involved Koolhaas's students analysing what others would regard as \"non-cities\", sprawling conglomerates such as [[Lagos]] in [[Nigeria]], west Africa, which the authors argue are highly functional despite a lack of infrastructure. The authors also examine the influence of shopping habits and the recent rapid growth of cities in [[China]]. Critics of the books have criticised Koolhaas for being cynical \u2013 as if Western [[capitalism]] and [[globalization]] demolish all cultural identity \u2013 highlighted in the notion expounded in the books that \"In the end, there will be little else for us to do but shop\". However, such cynicism can alternatively be read as a \"realism\" about the transformation of cultural life, where airports and even museums (due to finance problems) rely just as much on operating gift shops.\n\nWhen it comes to transforming these observations into practice, Koolhaas mobilizes what he regards as the omnipotent forces of urbanism into unique design forms and connections organised along the lines of present-day society. Koolhaas continuously incorporates his observations of the contemporary city within his design activities: calling such a condition the \u2018culture of congestion\u2019. Again, shopping is examined for \"intellectual comfort\", whilst the unregulated taste and densification of Chinese cities is analysed according to \"performance\", a criterion involving variables with debatable credibility: density, newness, shape, size, money etc. For example, in his design for the new [[China Central Television Headquarters|CCTV headquarters]] in Beijing (2009), Koolhaas did not opt for the stereotypical skyscraper, often used to symbolise and landmark such government enterprises, but instead designed a series of volumes which not only tie together the numerous departments onto the nebulous site, but also introduced routes (again, the concept of cross-programming) for the general public through the site, allowing them some degree of access to the production procedure. Through his ruthlessly raw approach, Koolhaas hopes to extract the architect from the anxiety of a dead profession and resurrect a contemporary interpretation of the sublime, however fleeting it may be.\n\nIn 2003, ''Content'', a 544-page magazine-style book designed by [[Andandand Creative|&&& Creative]] and published by Koolhaas, gives an overview of the last decade of OMA projects<ref>Koolhaas, Rem (2003) ''Content'', Taschen, New York, {{ISBN|3822830704}}</ref> including his designs for the [[Prada]] shops,<ref name=\"Luxury\"/> the [[Seattle Public Library]], a plan to save [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] from Harvard by rechanneling the [[Charles River]], Lagos' future as Earth's third-biggest city, as well as interviews with [[Martha Stewart]] and [[Robert Venturi]] and [[Denise Scott Brown]].\n\n===OMA===\nIn the late nineties, while working on the design for the new headquarters for Universal<ref>{{cite web |title=OMA Universal Studios project records |url=https://www.cca.qc.ca/en/archives/219994/oma-universal-studios-project-records |website=[[Canadian Centre for Architecture]] |accessdate=April 9, 2020}}</ref> (currently Vivendi), OMA was first exposed to the full pace of change that engulfed the world of media and with it the increasing importance of the virtual domain. It led Rem Koolhaas and the Office for Metropolitan Architecture (OMA) to create a new company, AMO, exclusively dedicated to the investigation and performance in this realm. He is heading the think tank ever since with Reinier de Graaf.\n\n===Volume Magazine===\nIn 2005, Rem Koolhaas co-founded ''[[Volume Magazine]]'' together with [[Mark Wigley]] and [[Ole Bouman]]. ''Volume Magazine'' \u2013 the collaborative project by Archis (Amsterdam), AMO Rotterdam and C-lab ([[Columbia University]] NY) \u2013 is a dynamic experimental think tank devoted to the process of spatial and cultural reflexivity. It goes beyond architecture\u2019s definition of \u2018making buildings\u2019 and reaches out for global views on architecture and design, broader attitudes to social structures, and creating environments to live in. The magazine stands for a journalism which detects and anticipates, is proactive and even pre-emptive \u2013 a journalism which uncovers potentialities, rather than covering done deals.\n\n===European Flag proposal===\n[[File:Union-europea segun rem-koolhaas.svg|thumb|[[European Flag]] proposal]]\n\nFollowing the signing of [[Treaty of Nice|Treaties of Nice]] in May 2001, which made [[Brussels]] the [[Brussels and the European Union|de facto capital of the European Union]], the then President of the [[European Commission]], [[Romano Prodi]] and the Belgian Prime Minister [[Guy Verhofstadt]] invited Koolhaas to discuss the necessities and requirements of a European capital.\n\nDuring these talks and as an impetus for further discussion, Koolhaas and his think-tank AMO \u2013 an independent part of  [[Office for Metropolitan Architecture|OMA]] \u2013 suggested the development of a visual language. This idea inspired a series of drawings and drafts, including the \"[[Barcode]]\". The barcode seeks to unite the flags of the EU member countries into a single, colourful symbol. In the current [[European flag]], there is a fixed number of stars. In the barcode however, new Member States of the EU can be added without space constraints. Originally, the barcode displayed 15 EU countries. In 2004, the symbol was adapted to include the ten new Member States.\n\nSince the time of the first drafts of the barcode it has very rarely been officially used by commercial or political institutions. During the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|Austrian EU Presidency 2006]], it was officially used for the first time. The logo was used for the EU information campaign, but was very negatively criticized. In addition to the initial uproar caused by the Estonian flag stripes being displayed incorrectly, the proposed flag failed to achieve its main objective as a symbol. Critics pointed the lack of capability to relate the signified (the mental concept, the European Union) with the signifier (the physical image, the stripes) as the major problem, as well as the presented justification for the order in which the color stripes were displayed (as every country in the EU should be regarded as equal in importance and priority).\n\n===Architecture, fashion, and theatre===\n[[File:PDRM0102.JPG|thumb|[[Prada]], [[Beverly Hills]], USA]]\n[[File:Second Stage Theatre seating.jpg|thumb|[[Second Stage Theatre]], New York, USA]]\n\nWith his [[Prada]] projects, Koolhaas ventured into providing architecture for the fleeting world of fashion and with celebrity-studded cachet: not unlike Garnier's Opera, the central space of Koolhaas' [[Beverly Hills]] Prada store is occupied by a massive central staircase, ostensibly displaying select wares, but mainly the shoppers themselves. The notion of selling a [[brand]] rather than marketing clothes was further emphasised in the Prada store on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] in Manhattan, New York,<ref name=\"Luxury\"/> which had previously been owned by the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation|Guggenheim]]: the museum signs were not removed during the outfitting of the new store, as if emphasizing the premises as a cultural institution.<ref>Anette Baldauf (2004) \"Branded\", in ''Learning from Calvin Klein'', Umbau 21.</ref> The Broadway Prada store opened in December 2001, cost \u20ac32 million to build, and has 2,300 square meters of retail space.<ref name=\"Luxury\"/>\n\nPrior to his Prada project in New York, Koolhaas was behind another remodeling project on the other side of town.  Koolhaas redesigned a 1929 bank and transformed it into a one-of-a-kind, 296 seat, performance space for [[Second Stage Theatre]] in [[Manhattan]].\n\n===21st Century Office===\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=July 2010}}\nAt the moment Koolhaas' constructions sites are in China:{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} the massive [[CCTV Headquarters|Central China Television Headquarters Building]] in Beijing, China, and the new building for the [[Shenzhen Stock Exchange]], the equivalent of the [[NASDAQ]] in China.\n\nRecently,{{when|date=January 2011}} he has changed the organization of his office to a partnership. Partners next to him are Ellen van Loon, Reinier de Graaf, Shohei Shigematsu, Jason Long, Iyad Alsaka, Victor van der Chijs and managing partner [[David Gianotten]]. The partner [[Ole Scheeren]] left OMA in March 2010 to start his own practice.\n\nKoolhaas now heads offices in Europe (OMA*AMO Rotterdam), North America (OMA*AMO Architecture PC New York) and Asia (OMA Beijing).\n\nOMA Rotterdam: the head office is working on a master plan for the [[White City, London|White City]] area of London; a harbour redevelopment and contemporary art Museum in [[Riga]], the [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia|Cordoba]] Congress Centre in Spain; the redevelopment of the Mercati Generali in [[Rome]], an architectural centre, offices and housing in [[Copenhagen]], the new head office of [[N M Rothschild & Sons|Rothschild Bank]] in London and multi-use towers in Rotterdam and The Hague. It is also working on various masterplans in the Netherlands and Belgium and shopping centres in Rotterdam and [[Ostrava]]. In addition the Rotterdam office has a number of activities in the Middle East including office and residential towers and master plans in [[Dubai]], three master plans in [[Ras al-Khaimah]] and several public buildings in [[Qatar]]. With his Rotterdam office Koolhaas is also designing a science center for [[Hamburg]]\u2019s [[HafenCity]].\n\nOMA New York: the office in Manhattan Koolhaas is leading by Shohei Shigematsu is now designing an extension of Cornell University (NY), 111 First Street, a high rise residential building and hotel in Jersey City (NJ) and a high end residential tower with CAA screening room at [[One Madison Park]] in NYC.\n\nOMA Beijing: In Asia, Koolhaas was working with his team on the office\u2019s largest project to date, the 575,000 m2 China Central Television Headquarters (CCTV) and [[Television Cultural Center]] (TVCC), both completed in Beijing in 2008. (However, the TVCC was damaged by an [[Television Cultural Center#Chinese New Year fire|enormous fire]] in 2009.) Other projects in completion include the new [[Shenzhen Stock Exchange]] and a lush residential tower and residential masterplan in [[Singapore]].\n\nThe influence of OMA has impacted many architecture students and architects who have worked at the office during their careers. Architects such as [[Bjarke Ingels]] ([[Bjarke Ingels Group|BIG]]), [[Jeanne Gang]] (Studio Gang), [[Amale Andraos]] and her husband Dan Wood (WORKac) are just some of the names of the many architects that have worked in the office.\n\n==Views on the nature and role of architecture==\nConsidered one of the most important [[architectural theory|architectural theorists]] and [[urbanists]] of his generation, Koolhaas, in a presentation at the [[Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat|CTBUH]] Awards Symposium (2013), said: \"When I published my last book, \"Content\", in 2003, one chapter was called \"Kill the Skyscraper\". Basically it was an expression of disappointment at the way the skyscraper typology was used and applied. I didn\u2019t think there was a lot of creative life left in [[skyscrapers]]. Therefore, I tried to launch a campaign against the skyscraper in its more uninspired form.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctbuh.org/Awards/SymposiumsCeremonies/OverviewofPastAwards/2013Awards/AwardsDinner/tabid/5948/language/en-US/Default.aspx |title= CCTV Headquarters Named Best Tall Building Worldwide |publisher=[[Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat]] (CTBUH) |date=7 Nov 2013|accessdate=28 June 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nKoolhaas was previously married to [[Madelon Vriesendorp]], an artist who is the mother of his two children, Charlie, a photographer, and Tomas, a filmmaker.<ref name=wmag>{{cite news|last=Lubow|first=Arthur|title=Rem Koolhaas Is Not a Starchitect\n|url=http://www.wmagazine.com/culture/art-and-design/2014/06/rem-koolhaas-venice-architecture-biennale/photos/|accessdate=13 October 2015|newspaper=The W Magazine|date=9 June 2014}}</ref> Koolhaas divorced Vriesendorp in 2012.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.wmagazine.com/story/rem-koolhaas-venice-architecture-biennale|title=Rem Koolhaas Is Not a Starchitect|last=Lubow|first=Arthur|date=|website=W Magazine|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-20|quote=Koolhaas and Blaisse have been together since 1986\u2014not living together, she notes, \u201cbut having a life together.\u201d Three years ago, they began sharing an apartment.

His father was a [[novelist]], [[critic]], and [[screenwriter]]. Two documentary films by [[Bert Haanstra]] for which his father wrote the scenarios were nominated for an [[Academy Award for Documentary Feature]], one won a [[Golden Bear (award)|Golden Bear]] for Short Film. His maternal grandfather, [[Dirk Roosenburg]] (1887\u20131962), was a [[Modern architecture|modernist architect]] who worked for [[Hendrik Petrus Berlage]], before opening his own practice. Rem Koolhaas has a brother, Thomas, and a sister, Annabel. His paternal cousin was the architect and urban planner [[Teun Koolhaas]] (1940\u20132007). The family lived consecutively in Rotterdam (until 1946), [[Amsterdam]] (1946\u20131952), [[Jakarta]] (1952\u20131955), and Amsterdam (from 1955).<ref>{{cite web\n  | last = Moor\n  | first = Wam de\n  | title = Koolhaas, Anthonie (1912\u20131992)\n  | work = Biografisch Woordenboek van Nederland\n  | publisher = Instituut voor Nederlandse Geschiedenis\n  | date = 13 March 2008\n  | url = http://www.inghist.nl/Onderzoek/Projecten/BWN/lemmata/bwn5/koolhaas\n  | accessdate = 14 May 2008 |language=nl}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Anthonie Koolhaas |work=De [[Boekenweek]] |url=http://www.schenkt.nl/Biografieen/koolhaas.htm |accessdate=14 May 2008 |language=nl |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201101236/http://www.schenkt.nl/Biografieen/koolhaas.htm |archivedate=1 December 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n  | last = Anker\n  | first = Eva van den\n  | title = Dirk Roosenburg\n  | work = Archipedia\n  | publisher = Architectenweb\n  | url = http://www.architectenweb.nl/aweb/archipedia/archipedia.asp?ID=789\n  | accessdate = 14 May 2008 |language=nl}}</ref>\n\nHis father strongly supported the Indonesian cause for autonomy from the colonial Dutch in his writing.

They were later joined by one of Koolhaas's students, [[Zaha Hadid]] \u2013 who would soon go on to achieve success in her own right. An early work which would mark their difference from the then dominant [[postmodern]] classicism of the late 1970s, was their contribution to the [[Venice Biennale]] of 1980, curated by Italian architect [[Paolo Portoghesi]], titled \"Presence of the Past\". Each architect had to design a stage-like \"frontage\" to a [[Potemkin village|Potemkin]]-type internal street; the fa\u00e7ades by {{Interlanguage link multi|Costantino Dardi|it}}, [[Frank Gehry]] and OMA were the only ones that did not employ [[Post-Modern]] architecture motifs or historical references.\n\nOther early critically received (yet unbuilt) projects included the [[Parc de la Villette]], Paris (1982) and the residence for the [[Taoiseach|Prime Minister of Ireland]] (1979), as well as the [[Kunsthal]] in Rotterdam (1992). These schemes would attempt to put into practice many of the findings Koolhaas made in his book ''Delirious New York'' (1978),<ref>Koolhaas, Rem (1978) ''Delirious New York: A retroactive Manifesto for Manhattan'', Academy Editions, London; republished, The Monacelli Press, 1994, {{ISBN|1885254008}}</ref> which was written while he was a visiting scholar at the [[Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies]] in New York, directed by [[Peter Eisenman]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Valentina|last=Ciuffi|title=Rem Koolhaas is stating 'the end' of his career, says Peter Eisenman|date=2014-06-09|url=https://www.dezeen.com/2014/06/09/rem-koolhaas-at-the-end-of-career-says-peter-eisenman/|website=dezeen.com|accessdate=2019-08-07}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2006, Rem Koolhaas was commissioned to develop [[111 First Street]] in [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]] across the [[Hudson River]] from [[Manhattan]], working with real estate developer [[Louis Dubin]].<ref name=tws2nov16>{{cite news\n |title        = Rem Koolhaas Commissioned for Development of 111 First Street in Jersey City, N.J.\n |quote        = ...the commissioning of The Office for Metropolitan Architecture (OMA) of Rem Koolhaas, an internationally renowned architect, for development of 111 First St., in Jersey City, N.J.\n |publisher    = BlueVerticalStudio\n |date         = 18 September 2006\n |url          = http://www.blueverticalstudio.com/go/?p=1988\n |accessdate   = 2 November 2009\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20071211011055/http://blueverticalstudio.com/go/?p=1988\n |archive-date = 11 December 2007\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2008, Rem Koolhaas was invited for a European \"group of the wise\" under the chairmanship of former Spanish prime minister [[Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez]] to help 'design' the future [[European Union]].

Koolhaas analyzes the \"chance-like\" nature of city life: \"The City is an addictive machine from which there is no escape\" \"Rem Koolhaas...defined the city as a collection of \u201cred hot spots.\u201d<ref>Klingmann, A (2007) ''Brandscapes: Architecture in the Experience Economy''. Mit Press, {{ISBN|0262515032}}</ref> ([[Anna Klingmann]]).  As Koolhaas himself has acknowledged, this approach had already been evident in the Japanese [[Metabolist Movement]] in the 1960s and early 1970s.\n[[File:Seattle Central Library by architect Rem Koolhaas, view from 5th Ave.jpg|thumb|[[Seattle Central Library]] Seattle, USA, designed by [[Office for Metropolitan Architecture|OMA]]]]\nA key aspect of architecture that Koolhaas interrogates is the \"[[brief (architecture)|Program]]\": with the rise of modernism in the 20th century the \"Program\" became the key theme of architectural design. The notion of the Program involves \"an act to edit function and human activities\" as the pretext of architectural design: epitomised in the maxim [[form follows function]], first popularised by architect [[Louis Henri Sullivan|Louis Sullivan]] at the beginning of the 20th century. The notion was first questioned in ''Delirious New York'', in his analysis of high-rise architecture in Manhattan. An early design method derived from such thinking was \"cross-programming\", introducing unexpected functions in room programmes, such as running tracks in skyscrapers. More recently, Koolhaas unsuccessfully proposed the inclusion of hospital units for the homeless into the Seattle Public Library project (2003).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.archdaily.com/449282/happy-birthday-rem-koolhaas-2|title=Spotlight: Rem Koolhaas|date=17 November 2018|website=ArchDaily}}</ref>\n\n===S,M,L,XL===\nThe next landmark publication by Koolhaas was ''[[S,M,L,XL]]'', together with [[Bruce Mau]], [[Jennifer Sigler]], and [[Hans Werlemann]] (1995),<ref>Koolhaas, Rem; Werlemann, Hans and Mau, Bruce (1994) ''S,M,L,XL'', The Monacelli Press, New York, (2nd edition 1998) {{ISBN|1885254865}}</ref> a 1376-page tome combining essays, manifestos, diaries, fiction, travelogues, and meditations on the contemporary city. The layout of the huge book transformed architectural publishing, and such books\u2014full-colour graphics and dense texts\u2014have since become common. Ostensibly, ''S,M,L,XL'' gives a record of the actual implementation of \"Manhattanism\" throughout the various (mostly unrealized) projects and texts OMA had generated up to that time. The part lexicon-type layout (with a marginal \"dictionary\" composed by [[Jennifer Sigler]], who also edited the book) spawned a number of concepts that have become common in later architectural theory, in particular \"Bigness\": 'old' architectural principles (composition, scale, proportion, detail) no longer apply when a building acquires Bigness. This was demonstrated in OMA's scheme for the development of \"[[Euralille]]\" (1990\u201394), a new centre for the city of [[Lille]] in France, a city returned to prominence by its position on the new rail route from Paris to London via the [[Channel Tunnel]]. OMA sited a train station, two centres for commerce and trade, an urban park, and 'Congrexpo' ([[:fr:Lille Grand Palais|Lille Grand Palais]], a contemporary \"[[Grand Palais]]\" with a large concert hall, three auditoria and an exhibition space) with [[Cecil Balmond]]. In another essay in the book, titled \"The Generic City\", Koolhaas declares that progress, identity, architecture, the city and the street are things of the past: \u201cRelief \u2026 it\u2019s over. That is the story of the city. The city is no longer. We can leave the theatre now...\u201d\n\n===Project on the city===\n[[File:Be Dutch Embassy 01.JPG|thumb|[[Embassy of the Netherlands, Berlin]], Germany, opened in 2004. Koolhaas's design won the [[Architekturpreis Berlin]] in 2003 and the [[Mies van der Rohe Award for European Architecture]] in 2005.]]\n\nKoolhaas's next landmark publications were a product of his position as professor at [[Harvard University]], in the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design|Design school]]'s \"Project on the City\"; firstly the 720-page ''Mutations'',<ref>Koolhaas, Rem ''et al.'' (2001) ''Mutations'', Arc en r\u00eave centre d\u2019architecture, Bordeaux, {{ISBN|84-95273-51-9}}.</ref> followed by ''The Harvard Design School Guide to Shopping'' (2002)<ref>Koolhaas, Rem; Chung, Chuihua Judy; Inaba, Jeffrey and Leong, Sze Tsung (2002) ''The Harvard Design School Guide to Shopping. Harvard Design School Project on the City 2'', Taschen, New York, {{ISBN|3822860476}}</ref> and ''The Great Leap Forward'' (2002).<ref>Koolhaas, Rem ''et al.'' (2002) ''The Great Leap Forward. Harvard Design School Project on the City'', Taschen, New York, {{ISBN|3822860484}}</ref> All three books involved Koolhaas's students analysing what others would regard as \"non-cities\", sprawling conglomerates such as [[Lagos]] in [[Nigeria]], west Africa, which the authors argue are highly functional despite a lack of infrastructure. The authors also examine the influence of shopping habits and the recent rapid growth of cities in [[China]]. Critics of the books have criticised Koolhaas for being cynical \u2013 as if Western [[capitalism]] and [[globalization]] demolish all cultural identity \u2013 highlighted in the notion expounded in the books that \"In the end, there will be little else for us to do but shop\". However, such cynicism can alternatively be read as a \"realism\" about the transformation of cultural life, where airports and even museums (due to finance problems) rely just as much on operating gift shops.\n\nWhen it comes to transforming these observations into practice, Koolhaas mobilizes what he regards as the omnipotent forces of urbanism into unique design forms and connections organised along the lines of present-day society. Koolhaas continuously incorporates his observations of the contemporary city within his design activities: calling such a condition the \u2018culture of congestion\u2019. Again, shopping is examined for \"intellectual comfort\", whilst the unregulated taste and densification of Chinese cities is analysed according to \"performance\", a criterion involving variables with debatable credibility: density, newness, shape, size, money etc. For example, in his design for the new [[China Central Television Headquarters|CCTV headquarters]] in Beijing (2009), Koolhaas did not opt for the stereotypical skyscraper, often used to symbolise and landmark such government enterprises, but instead designed a series of volumes which not only tie together the numerous departments onto the nebulous site, but also introduced routes (again, the concept of cross-programming) for the general public through the site, allowing them some degree of access to the production procedure. Through his ruthlessly raw approach, Koolhaas hopes to extract the architect from the anxiety of a dead profession and resurrect a contemporary interpretation of the sublime, however fleeting it may be.\n\nIn 2003, ''Content'', a 544-page magazine-style book designed by [[Andandand Creative|&&& Creative]] and published by Koolhaas, gives an overview of the last decade of OMA projects<ref>Koolhaas, Rem (2003) ''Content'', Taschen, New York, {{ISBN|3822830704}}</ref> including his designs for the [[Prada]] shops,<ref name=\"Luxury\"/> the [[Seattle Public Library]], a plan to save [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] from Harvard by rechanneling the [[Charles River]], Lagos' future as Earth's third-biggest city, as well as interviews with [[Martha Stewart]] and [[Robert Venturi]] and [[Denise Scott Brown]].\n\n===OMA===\nIn the late nineties, while working on the design for the new headquarters for Universal<ref>{{cite web |title=OMA Universal Studios project records |url=https://www.cca.qc.ca/en/archives/219994/oma-universal-studios-project-records |website=[[Canadian Centre for Architecture]] |accessdate=April 9, 2020}}</ref> (currently Vivendi), OMA was first exposed to the full pace of change that engulfed the world of media and with it the increasing importance of the virtual domain. It led Rem Koolhaas and the Office for Metropolitan Architecture (OMA) to create a new company, AMO, exclusively dedicated to the investigation and performance in this realm. He is heading the think tank ever since with Reinier de Graaf.\n\n===Volume Magazine===\nIn 2005, Rem Koolhaas co-founded ''[[Volume Magazine]]'' together with [[Mark Wigley]] and [[Ole Bouman]]. ''Volume Magazine'' \u2013 the collaborative project by Archis (Amsterdam), AMO Rotterdam and C-lab ([[Columbia University]] NY) \u2013 is a dynamic experimental think tank devoted to the process of spatial and cultural reflexivity. It goes beyond architecture\u2019s definition of \u2018making buildings\u2019 and reaches out for global views on architecture and design, broader attitudes to social structures, and creating environments to live in. The magazine stands for a journalism which detects and anticipates, is proactive and even pre-emptive \u2013 a journalism which uncovers potentialities, rather than covering done deals.\n\n===European Flag proposal===\n[[File:Union-europea segun rem-koolhaas.svg|thumb|[[European Flag]] proposal]]\n\nFollowing the signing of [[Treaty of Nice|Treaties of Nice]] in May 2001, which made [[Brussels]] the [[Brussels and the European Union|de facto capital of the European Union]], the then President of the [[European Commission]], [[Romano Prodi]] and the Belgian Prime Minister [[Guy Verhofstadt]] invited Koolhaas to discuss the necessities and requirements of a European capital.\n\nDuring these talks and as an impetus for further discussion, Koolhaas and his think-tank AMO \u2013 an independent part of  [[Office for Metropolitan Architecture|OMA]] \u2013 suggested the development of a visual language. This idea inspired a series of drawings and drafts, including the \"[[Barcode]]\". The barcode seeks to unite the flags of the EU member countries into a single, colourful symbol. In the current [[European flag]], there is a fixed number of stars. In the barcode however, new Member States of the EU can be added without space constraints. Originally, the barcode displayed 15 EU countries. In 2004, the symbol was adapted to include the ten new Member States.\n\nSince the time of the first drafts of the barcode it has very rarely been officially used by commercial or political institutions. During the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|Austrian EU Presidency 2006]], it was officially used for the first time. The logo was used for the EU information campaign, but was very negatively criticized. In addition to the initial uproar caused by the Estonian flag stripes being displayed incorrectly, the proposed flag failed to achieve its main objective as a symbol. Critics pointed the lack of capability to relate the signified (the mental concept, the European Union) with the signifier (the physical image, the stripes) as the major problem, as well as the presented justification for the order in which the color stripes were displayed (as every country in the EU should be regarded as equal in importance and priority).\n\n===Architecture, fashion, and theatre===\n[[File:PDRM0102.JPG|thumb|[[Prada]], [[Beverly Hills]], USA]]\n[[File:Second Stage Theatre seating.jpg|thumb|[[Second Stage Theatre]], New York, USA]]\n\nWith his [[Prada]] projects, Koolhaas ventured into providing architecture for the fleeting world of fashion and with celebrity-studded cachet: not unlike Garnier's Opera, the central space of Koolhaas' [[Beverly Hills]] Prada store is occupied by a massive central staircase, ostensibly displaying select wares, but mainly the shoppers themselves. The notion of selling a [[brand]] rather than marketing clothes was further emphasised in the Prada store on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] in Manhattan, New York,<ref name=\"Luxury\"/> which had previously been owned by the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation|Guggenheim]]: the museum signs were not removed during the outfitting of the new store, as if emphasizing the premises as a cultural institution.<ref>Anette Baldauf (2004) \"Branded\", in ''Learning from Calvin Klein'', Umbau 21.</ref> The Broadway Prada store opened in December 2001, cost \u20ac32 million to build, and has 2,300 square meters of retail space.<ref name=\"Luxury\"/>\n\nPrior to his Prada project in New York, Koolhaas was behind another remodeling project on the other side of town.  Koolhaas redesigned a 1929 bank and transformed it into a one-of-a-kind, 296 seat, performance space for [[Second Stage Theatre]] in [[Manhattan]].\n\n===21st Century Office===\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=July 2010}}\nAt the moment Koolhaas' constructions sites are in China:{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} the massive [[CCTV Headquarters|Central China Television Headquarters Building]] in Beijing, China, and the new building for the [[Shenzhen Stock Exchange]], the equivalent of the [[NASDAQ]] in China.\n\nRecently,{{when|date=January 2011}} he has changed the organization of his office to a partnership. Partners next to him are Ellen van Loon, Reinier de Graaf, Shohei Shigematsu, Jason Long, Iyad Alsaka, Victor van der Chijs and managing partner [[David Gianotten]]. The partner [[Ole Scheeren]] left OMA in March 2010 to start his own practice.\n\nKoolhaas now heads offices in Europe (OMA*AMO Rotterdam), North America (OMA*AMO Architecture PC New York) and Asia (OMA Beijing).\n\nOMA Rotterdam: the head office is working on a master plan for the [[White City, London|White City]] area of London; a harbour redevelopment and contemporary art Museum in [[Riga]], the [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia|Cordoba]] Congress Centre in Spain; the redevelopment of the Mercati Generali in [[Rome]], an architectural centre, offices and housing in [[Copenhagen]], the new head office of [[N M Rothschild & Sons|Rothschild Bank]] in London and multi-use towers in Rotterdam and The Hague. It is also working on various masterplans in the Netherlands and Belgium and shopping centres in Rotterdam and [[Ostrava]]. In addition the Rotterdam office has a number of activities in the Middle East including office and residential towers and master plans in [[Dubai]], three master plans in [[Ras al-Khaimah]] and several public buildings in [[Qatar]]. With his Rotterdam office Koolhaas is also designing a science center for [[Hamburg]]\u2019s [[HafenCity]].\n\nOMA New York: the office in Manhattan Koolhaas is leading by Shohei Shigematsu is now designing an extension of Cornell University (NY), 111 First Street, a high rise residential building and hotel in Jersey City (NJ) and a high end residential tower with CAA screening room at [[One Madison Park]] in NYC.\n\nOMA Beijing: In Asia, Koolhaas was working with his team on the office\u2019s largest project to date, the 575,000 m2 China Central Television Headquarters (CCTV) and [[Television Cultural Center]] (TVCC), both completed in Beijing in 2008. (However, the TVCC was damaged by an [[Television Cultural Center#Chinese New Year fire|enormous fire]] in 2009.) Other projects in completion include the new [[Shenzhen Stock Exchange]] and a lush residential tower and residential masterplan in [[Singapore]].\n\nThe influence of OMA has impacted many architecture students and architects who have worked at the office during their careers. Architects such as [[Bjarke Ingels]] ([[Bjarke Ingels Group|BIG]]), [[Jeanne Gang]] (Studio Gang), [[Amale Andraos]] and her husband Dan Wood (WORKac) are just some of the names of the many architects that have worked in the office.\n\n==Views on the nature and role of architecture==\nConsidered one of the most important [[architectural theory|architectural theorists]] and [[urbanists]] of his generation, Koolhaas, in a presentation at the [[Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat|CTBUH]] Awards Symposium (2013), said: \"When I published my last book, \"Content\", in 2003, one chapter was called \"Kill the Skyscraper\". Basically it was an expression of disappointment at the way the skyscraper typology was used and applied. I didn\u2019t think there was a lot of creative life left in [[skyscrapers]].

Raised in Napier, he joined the RNZAF in September 1940, and by April 1942 was a [[pilot officer]] serving with the [[Royal Air Force]] in [[European Theatre of World War II|Europe]]. On 8 June 1944, Lamason was in command of a [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster]] heavy bomber that was shot down during a raid on railway marshalling yards near [[Paris]]. [[Parachute|Bailing out]], he was picked up by members of the [[French Resistance]] and hidden at various locations for seven weeks. While attempting to reach Spain along the [[Comet line]], Lamason was double-crossed by a [[Treason|traitor]] within the Resistance and handed over to the [[Gestapo]].\n\nAfter [[interrogation]], he was taken to [[Fresnes prison]]. Classified as a \"Terrorflieger\" (terror flier), he was not accorded [[prisoner-of-war]] (POW) status, but instead treated as a criminal and spy. By 15 August 1944, Lamason was [[Military rank#Field or senior officers|senior officer]] of a group of 168 captured Allied airmen who were taken by train to Buchenwald concentration camp, arriving there five days later.\n\nAt Buchenwald, the airmen were fully shaved, [[Starvation|starved]], denied shoes, and for three weeks forced to sleep outside without shelter in one of the sub-camps known as \"Little Camp\". As senior officer, Lamason took control and instilled a level of [[Military courtesy|military discipline]] and bearing.\n\nFor several weeks Lamason negotiated with the camp authorities to have the airmen transferred to a POW camp, but his requests were denied. At great risk, Lamason secretly got word to the [[Luftwaffe]] of the Allied airmen's captivity and, seven days before their scheduled [[Capital punishment|execution]], 156 of the 168 prisoners were transferred to [[Stalag Luft III]]. Most of the airmen credit their survival at Buchenwald to the leadership and determination of Lamason. After the war, he moved to [[Dannevirke]] and became a farmer until his retirement. During the 1980s and 1990s, he was a regular speaker at [[KLB Club]] and POW reunions.\n\n==Early career==\nLamason was born and raised in [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]], a city in New Zealand's [[North Island]], on 15 September 1918.<ref name=Thompson>Thompson, H.

Raised in Napier, he joined the RNZAF in September 1940, and by April 1942 was a [[pilot officer]] serving with the [[Royal Air Force]] in [[European Theatre of World War II|Europe]]. On 8 June 1944, Lamason was in command of a [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster]] heavy bomber that was shot down during a raid on railway marshalling yards near [[Paris]]. [[Parachute|Bailing out]], he was picked up by members of the [[French Resistance]] and hidden at various locations for seven weeks. While attempting to reach Spain along the [[Comet line]], Lamason was double-crossed by a [[Treason|traitor]] within the Resistance and handed over to the [[Gestapo]].\n\nAfter [[interrogation]], he was taken to [[Fresnes prison]]. Classified as a \"Terrorflieger\" (terror flier), he was not accorded [[prisoner-of-war]] (POW) status, but instead treated as a criminal and spy. By 15 August 1944, Lamason was [[Military rank#Field or senior officers|senior officer]] of a group of 168 captured Allied airmen who were taken by train to Buchenwald concentration camp, arriving there five days later.\n\nAt Buchenwald, the airmen were fully shaved, [[Starvation|starved]], denied shoes, and for three weeks forced to sleep outside without shelter in one of the sub-camps known as \"Little Camp\". As senior officer, Lamason took control and instilled a level of [[Military courtesy|military discipline]] and bearing.\n\nFor several weeks Lamason negotiated with the camp authorities to have the airmen transferred to a POW camp, but his requests were denied. At great risk, Lamason secretly got word to the [[Luftwaffe]] of the Allied airmen's captivity and, seven days before their scheduled [[Capital punishment|execution]], 156 of the 168 prisoners were transferred to [[Stalag Luft III]]. Most of the airmen credit their survival at Buchenwald to the leadership and determination of Lamason. After the war, he moved to [[Dannevirke]] and became a farmer until his retirement. During the 1980s and 1990s, he was a regular speaker at [[KLB Club]] and POW reunions.\n\n==Early career==\nLamason was born and raised in [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]], a city in New Zealand's [[North Island]], on 15 September 1918.<ref name=Thompson>Thompson, H.
