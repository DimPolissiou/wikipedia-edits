It was first shown on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] from 9 October 1971 to 6 November 1983, hosted by [[Nicholas Parsons]]. Special ''Celebrity Sale of the Century'' editions aired occasionally, starting on 2 January 1981 with [[Steve Jones (game show presenter)|Steve Jones]] as host.\n\nThe first series was aired only in the Anglia region, but it rolled out to other regions by 8 January 1972 and achieved full national coverage by 10 May 1975, at which point it was one of the most popular shows on the network \u2013 spawning the often-mocked introductory phrase \"And now, from [[Norwich]], it's the quiz of the week\". Since Norwich was considered a backwater compared to [[London]], it was often used ironically.\n\nIt has been revived twice: first on [[Sky 1|Sky Channel]] from 6 February 1989 to 3 October 1991 hosted by [[Peter Marshall (UK broadcaster)|Peter Marshall]] and then on [[Challenge (TV channel)|Challenge TV]] in 1997 hosted by [[Keith Chegwin]].\n\n==Rules (1971\u20131983; 1997)==\nThe ITV and Challenge versions followed the rules of the original American version. Three contestants start off with \u00a315 (\u00a310 in the earliest series). Questions are worth different values starting with \u00a31, increasing to \u00a33 after the second instant bargain, and finally \u00a35 after the fourth; by the final two ITV series, the values started at \u00a33 but increased to \u00a35 after the fourth instant bargain. The question is asked and players can buzz in at any time. Correct answers add the money to their score and incorrect answers subtract the money from their score with only one player allowed to buzz in on each question. If a contestant runs out of money at any time, they are eliminated from further play, but may remain in their seat for the remainder of the show.\n\n===Instant Bargain and Instant Sale===\nAt four points during gameplay (later five), all contestants would be offered the opportunity to purchase merchandise at a bargain price. The first player to buzz in after the prize was revealed purchased that prize. (In so doing, a \"losing\" contestant might not advance to go shopping at the end of the show, but could leave the show with a considerable haul for one day's play.) In the early days, the prices of all prizes offered were expressed much as one would hear in a department store (e.g., \u00a37.95, \u00a311.95, \u00a314.95, \u00a321.95). All prize values were rounded off to the nearest pound before being subtracted from the score of the player who purchased the prize (later on, prizes were in full pounds, like \u00a38, \u00a312, \u00a315, \u00a322, and increased as the show progressed). Each instant bargain was hidden behind a curtain; the announcer would mention the price, and then the curtain would open as the prize was revealed. If a contestant buzzed in before the curtain opened, it was declared \"No Sale\", the contestant would have the price deducted from his/her score (but not win the prize), and the other contestants could then buzz in.\n\nAlso during the early ITV series, an \"Open Sale\" was offered just before the commercial break, in which a number of smaller gifts were offered for less than \u00a35 each. In this situation, more than one player could buy a given gift, and a player could buy any or all of the prizes on offer.  They could even buy two or more of some items. By 1982, Open Sale had been replaced by an instant bargain.\n\nThe Challenge TV version kept the rules of the ITV version, except there was no \"Open Sale\", and players were spotted \u00a315 to start. There were five rounds with questions being worth \u00a31 in round one, \u00a33 in rounds two and three, and \u00a35 in rounds four and five. Finally, the game ended with 60 seconds of \u00a35 questions. The player in the lead at the end of this round was declared the champion.\n\n==Rules (1989\u20131991)==\nThe Sky Channel version had rules that were based on Australia's 1980\u20131988 format and America's 1983\u20131989 format, with better prizes than before.\n\nIn this format, each player started with \u00a320, and each question was worth only \u00a35.\n\nThere were only three \"Instant Sales\" (renamed Gift Shops), and only the player in the lead could buy.\n\nThe biggest change was the \"Fame Game\": Here, a succession of increasingly larger clues were given to the identity of a famous person, place, or event. In this round, players could buzz-in and answer at any time, with the player shut out for the remainder of the question if they gave an incorrect answer.\n\nIf one of the players buzzed-in and answered correctly, the contestant chose from a game board with nine squares. If all three contestants failed to come up with a right answer, then nobody got to pick. Once chosen, the space selected would be spun around to reveal either a relatively small prize (typically appliances or furniture valued at around a weekly wage) or a bonus money card, which added to the player's score.\n\nThere were \u00a310, \u00a315, and \u00a325 bonuses added each round; in addition, in the third round was a \"Wild Card\", which offered the choice of \u00a3100 or a chance to pick again.\n\nThe game ended with the Speed Round where the host would ask as many questions as possible within 60 seconds. The player with the most money when time ran out won the game.\n\nIf there was a tie for the lead after the Speed Round, another question was asked of the tied players. Answering this question awarded \u00a35 and the win; missing the question deducted \u00a35 and lost the game.\n\n==Shopping==\nThe winning contestant would be given the opportunity to spend their cash total on at least one of four grand prizes at the \"Sale of the Century\" which almost always included a new car. Originally, champions could buy prizes totaling no more than \u00a31,000 (\u00a32,500 in the late 1970s). From 1981 to 1983, any champion who won the game with \u00a3140 or more could choose to purchase one of the lesser four prizes or correctly answer a possible four of five questions, with no risk, to win a car.\n\nOn the 1989\u20131991 and 1997 versions, there were a series of six prizes (five in 1997) and as the contestant's score built up, it applied to the next highest prize, with a car again being the top prize, which was available for \u00a3585 (\u00a3500 in 1997). Like the Australian and American versions, they could buy the prize and leave or risk it and come back. However, unlike the Australian and American versions, there was no cash jackpot available or the chance to buy all the prizes on stage.\n\nOn all versions, losing contestants kept the money and prizes earned.\n\n==Other background information==\nThe series was one of the most consistently high-rating entertainment shows of the 1970s, gaining peak viewing figures of 20 million. This original version of the show was restricted in the prize amount through then national agreements, meaning that the featured cars had to be below set limits. The producers hence preferred to engage with foreign manufacturers to provide better value prize, often including top of the range [[Lada]]s.\n\nOn 22 December 1978, an all-out strike at the [[BBC]] meant that 21.2 million viewers watched the programme, the highest ever rating for a [[game show]] produced by [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]].\n\nBy the time the original version ended, it had awarded 500 contestants over \u00a3500,000 in prizes.\n\nCelebrity special aired occasionally from 2 January 1981, with prizes won going to charities.\n\nThe show is often famed as having been the place that record producer [[Simon Cowell]] made his television debut. The video (of his appearance on the 1989 version) is available on [[YouTube]] and extracts of it were shown during the [[14th National Television Awards|National Television Awards]] in Cowell's VT before receiving the Special Recognition Award from [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]. Cowell appeared on 2 episodes (winning his first game) and won only \u00a320 worth of cooking utensils.\n\nThe show's theme tune, composed by Peter Fenn, was entitled \"Joyful Pete\", in tribute to the show's original producer, Peter Joy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.edp24.co.uk/news/obituaries/peter-fenn-anglia-tv-s-musical-director-wrote-sale-of-the-century-quiz-theme-1-895267 |title=Peter Fenn: Anglia TV's musical director wrote Sale of the Century quiz theme |date=17 May 2011 |accessdate=28 January 2020 |publisher=Eastern Daily Press}}</ref>\n\n==Transmissions==\n===ITV era===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

The producers hence preferred to engage with foreign manufacturers to provide better value prize, often including top of the range [[Lada]]s.\n\nOn 22 December 1978, an all-out strike at the [[BBC]] meant that 21.2 million viewers watched the programme, the highest ever rating for a [[game show]] produced by [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]].\n\nBy the time the original version ended, it had awarded 500 contestants over \u00a3500,000 in prizes.\n\nCelebrity special aired occasionally from 2 January 1981, with prizes won going to charities.\n\nThe show is often famed as having been the place that record producer [[Simon Cowell]] made his television debut. The video (of his appearance on the 1989 version) is available on [[YouTube]] and extracts of it were shown during the [[14th National Television Awards|National Television Awards]] in Cowell's VT before receiving the Special Recognition Award from [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]. Cowell appeared on 2 episodes (winning his first game) and won only \u00a320 worth of cooking utensils.\n\nThe show's theme tune, composed by Peter Fenn, was entitled \"Joyful Pete\", in tribute to the show's original producer, Peter Joy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.edp24.co.uk/news/obituaries/peter-fenn-anglia-tv-s-musical-director-wrote-sale-of-the-century-quiz-theme-1-895267 |title=Peter Fenn: Anglia TV's musical director wrote Sale of the Century quiz theme |date=17 May 2011 |accessdate=28 January 2020 |publisher=Eastern Daily Press}}</ref>\n\n==Transmissions==\n===ITV era===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

The being known as Dharma was able to use energies that he harnessed from Rift (upon that being's defeat in ''[[Worlds Collide (comics)|Worlds Collide]]'') to merge the two universes, creating an entirely new continuity.

Believing Raquel and the Shadow Cabinet agents have kidnapped former ''[[Justice League International]]'' member [[Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi)|Kimiyo Hoshi]] (Dr. Light II), Batman immediately attempts to strike Rocket with a [[batarang]], which she easily deflects with her powers. After berating Batman and informing him that Kimiyo is unharmed, Rocket accompanies the Shadow Cabinet Agents and JLA members to the [[Justice League Satellite]], where they aid Icon, [[Hawkman]], and the rest of the Shadow Cabinet and JLA members in a battle with the [[Shadow Thief]]. Once Shadow Thief is defeated, Rocket and the other Milestone heroes return home by use of the ''Shadowslide'', with Raquel and Augustus presumably returning to Dakota.<ref name=\"jla30\"/>\n\nOn her [[Twitter]] account, writer [[Gail Simone]] mentioned that she had planned on using Rocket at some point during her tenure on ''[[Wonder Woman]]'', but was not allowed to.<ref>\"Tried to use her in WW but wasn't allowed!\" rt @ LindAp7618 @GailSimone Any chance of Rocket from Milestone showing up in BOP?</ref><ref>https://twitter.com/Gailsimone 4:04 AM Apr 30th via web</ref>\nRocket makes a cameo appearance in ''Justice League'', speaking to Wonder Woman.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n\n===Powers===\nNone. All of Rocket's superhuman powers derive from her inertia belt (see Equipment). By using her belt, she can manipulate kinetic energy, granting some super strength, and a kinetic force field.\n\n===Skills===\nRaquel Ervin is a voracious reader and a gifted writer. A former high school gymnast, she is very agile and has quick reflexes. Rocket is also a good hand-to-hand combatant due to her crime fighting experience as Icon's sidekick.\n\n==Equipment==\nAll of Rocket's superhuman powers derive from the inertia winder installed in her belt buckle.<ref name=Icon2>''Icon'' #2</ref> This device is one of two from Icon's escape pod, the other is installed in [[Hardware (comics)|Hardware]]'s current suit of armor.<ref name=hardware16>''Hardware'' #16</ref> When activated, the inertia winder surrounds Rocket in an \"inertia field,\" which absorbs, stores, and redirects any [[kinetic energy]] used against it.<ref name=Icon2>''Icon'' #2</ref> Rocket's inertia field is normally invisible to the human eye. The field glows purple when it absorbs or releases kinetic energy.<ref name=Icon2>''Icon'' #2</ref>\n\nThe inertia field primarily serves as a [[force shield|force field]] that protects her from anything invested with kinetic energy: physical blows,<ref name=Icon2>''Icon'' #2</ref> bullets,<ref name=Icon2>''Icon'' #2</ref> falls,<ref name=Icon13>''Icon'' #13</ref> etc. The maximum amount of kinetic energy Rocket's inertia field can absorb and store is unknown. However, the field nearly reached its limit during Rocket's battle with Oblivion.<ref name=Icon26>''Icon'' #26</ref>\n\nRocket's inertia field normally extends a few inches from her body,<ref name=Icon2>''Icon'' #2</ref> but she can expand the field to enclose much greater areas. She once used it to protect a small crowd of people without any loss of its durability.<ref name=Icon29>''Icon'' #29</ref>\n\nRocket can release the field's stored energy, giving her a range of offensive abilities. She can strike with superhuman force by surrounding her fists with kinetic energy.<ref name=Icon2>''Icon'' #2</ref> By releasing all the energy in the inertia field, she can stagger powerful beings like Icon with a single blow.<ref name=Icon28>''Icon'' #28</ref> However, such a feat would leave Rocket defenseless so she prefers to throw less powerful punches. Furthermore, Rocket has moral qualms about using her full store of kinetic energy against normal human opponents.\n\nRocket can also use kinetic energy to increase the force with which she hurls an object, turning it into a dangerous projectile.<ref name=Icon2>''Icon'' #2</ref> For example, she once hurled a bullet with enough force to rival a shot from a high-caliber rifle. This ability is limited to objects which she can lift and toss with her normal strength.\n\nBy releasing her store kinetic energy in focus beams, Rocket can project powerful energy blasts from her hands.<ref name=Icon2>''Icon'' #2</ref> As with her kinetic punches, the force of these blasts depends on how much kinetic energy she uses.\n\nRecently, Rocket has learned how to use her inertia winder to surround a target within an \"inertialess field.\"<ref name=Icon39>''Icon'' #39</ref> This field's kinetic energy nullifies the energy of anything trapped within down to the molecular level. As a result, Rocket can use the inertialess field to effectively immobilize her opponents. In fact, some opponents can fall unconscious in as much as the field prevents [[oxygen]] molecules from reaching their lungs. The inertialess field consumes enormous amounts of energy and collapses after a few seconds.<ref name=Icon39>''Icon'' #39</ref>\n\nRocket can fly by releasing her inertia field's kinetic energy beneath her, launching her skyward. Initially, she was not very skilled with this ability and thus could only leap over great distances.<ref name=Icon24>''Icon'' #24</ref> However, after training from Darnice, Rocket can use her kinetic energy as a means of propulsion for genuine flight.<ref name=Icon24>''Icon'' #24</ref> Rocket is capable of flying through narrow corridors and performing complex aerial maneuvers.<ref name=Icon28>''Icon'' #28</ref> She can even hover in midair by releasing controlled bursts of kinetic energy beneath her.<ref name=Icon28>''Icon'' #28</ref>\n\nRocket's inertia field has certain weaknesses due to its very nature. First, the field will not activate if a person or object exerts little kinetic energy against it. This makes Rocket vulnerable to stealth attacks, which rely on slower movements and minimal force.<ref name=Icon14>''Icon'' #14</ref> Second, the inertia field offers little protection against weapons based on non-kinetic energy like thermal (e.g., [[flamethrowers]])<ref name=Icon23>''Icon'' #23</ref> or electrical (e.g., [[tasers]]).<ref name=Icon2>''Icon'' #2</ref> Finally, Rocket will begin to feel the force of attacks directed against the field if it is overloaded as occurred in her battle with Oblivion.<ref name=Icon26>''Icon'' #26</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\nRocket appears in ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'', voiced by [[Kali Troy|Kittie]] in \"Usual Suspects\", \"Auld Acquaintance\" and \"Satisfaction\", and by [[Denise Boutte]] in \"Intervention\". In the episode \"Revelation\", she and Icon are shown helping the Justice League fight off a massive plant creature created by the [[Injustice League]]. She reappears in the episode \"Failsafe\", working alongside [[Roy Harper (comics)|Red Arrow]], [[Zatanna]], [[Garth (comics)|Garth]] and [[Tula (Young Justice)|Tula]] as part of a resistance cell trying to stop an alien invasion. She later appears in \"Misplaced,\" saving a bus on the edge of a bridge. In \"Agendas\", [[Wonder Woman]] nominates Rocket for membership in the Justice League, a sentiment which is echoed by both [[Black Canary]] and [[Hawkwoman]]. However, [[Superman]] rejects this notion on the grounds that she is not old enough to join the League. In \"Usual Suspects\", Rocket joins the Team after Icon is inducted into the Justice League; at the end of the episode she learns that stopping worldwide threat level criminals is a normal day for the team. She helped the rest of the team defeat Vandal Savage and the mind controlled Justice League, notably taking down her mentor and incapacitating Wonder Woman.  She displays an attraction to [[Aqualad (Jackson Hyde)|Aqualad]], and kisses him at the end of \"Auld Acquaintance\". \nShe appears in the second season, set five years after the events of \"Auld Acquaintance\". Now an adult, Rocket is shown as a member of the Justice League alongside her former teammate [[Zatanna]]. Later in the season, Rocket is engaged and throws a bridal shower to celebrate with most of the old and new female members of the League and the Team. In \"Intervention\", Rocket assists Zatanna form a containment field around Blue Beetle as part of a plot to break the Reach's control over him. \nShe appears in ''[[Young Justice: Outsiders]]'', two years later after ''Invasion'', as cameo in \"Princes All\" sitting next to Zatana. In \"Triptych\", Rocket prevents [[Brick (comics)|Brick]] from escaping. In \"Home Fires\", she and her son Amistad join [[Iris West]]'s play date group.\n\n===Video Games===\nRocket appears as a playable character in the video game ''[[Young Justice: Legacy]]'', voiced by [[Cree Summer]].\n\n==Notes==\n* Rocket held [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] views on economic and social issues, which resulted in her often clashing with her [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] partner, [[Icon (comics)|Icon]].  Under her influence, Icon eventually began re-evaluating his views.\n* [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]'s ''[[The Souls of Black Folk]]'' was a major influence in shaping Rocket's liberal views.<ref name=Icon1 />\n* Rocket is the first comic book superheroine who is a single teenage mother. The only other one is [[Mirage (DC Comics)|Mirage]], a former member of the Teen Titans. Although [[Stephanie Brown (comics)|Stephanie Brown]], the former [[Batgirl]] and current Spoiler, gave birth at 15, she gave the child up for adoption.<ref name=\"worldofblackheroes.wordpress.com\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Icon (comics)|Icon]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://worldofblackheroes.com/2011/03/09/rocket-raquel-ervin/ World of Black Heroes: Rocket Biography]\n* [http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/r/rocket.htm International Heroes: Rocket]\n* [[DCDatabase:Raquel Ervin (Dakotaverse)|Rocket at the DC Database Project]]\n* [http://www.blacksuperhero.com/exhibithtml/detail.cfm?id=340 Museum of Black Superheroes: Rocket]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n\n{{Milestone Media}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rocket (Comics)}}\n[[Category:Comic book sidekicks]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1993]]\n[[Category:DC Comics female superheroes]]\n[[Category:Black people in comics]]\n[[Category:Female characters in comics]]\n[[Category:African-American superheroes]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Dwayne McDuffie]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox comics character <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n|image= Rocketdcu0.jpg\n|imagesize= <!-- numeral only, defaults to 250 -->\n|converted = y\n|caption = Rocket from Icon #35.

After berating Batman and informing him that Kimiyo is unharmed, Rocket accompanies the Shadow Cabinet Agents and JLA members to the [[Justice League Satellite]], where they aid Icon, [[Hawkman]], and the rest of the Shadow Cabinet and JLA members in a battle with the [[Shadow Thief]]. Once Shadow Thief is defeated, Rocket and the other Milestone heroes return home by use of the ''Shadowslide'', with Raquel and Augustus presumably returning to Dakota.<ref name=\"jla30\"/>\n\nOn her [[Twitter]] account, writer [[Gail Simone]] mentioned that she had planned on using Rocket at some point during her tenure on ''[[Wonder Woman]]'', but was not allowed to.<ref>\"Tried to use her in WW but wasn't allowed!\" rt @ LindAp7618 @GailSimone Any chance of Rocket from Milestone showing up in BOP?</ref><ref>https://twitter.com/Gailsimone 4:04 AM Apr 30th via web</ref>\nRocket makes a cameo appearance in ''Justice League'', speaking to Wonder Woman.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n\n===Powers===\nNone. All of Rocket's superhuman powers derive from her inertia belt (see Equipment). By using her belt, she can manipulate kinetic energy, granting some super strength, and a kinetic force field.\n\n===Skills===\nRaquel Ervin is a voracious reader and a gifted writer. A former high school gymnast, she is very agile and has quick reflexes. Rocket is also a good hand-to-hand combatant due to her crime fighting experience as Icon's sidekick.\n\n==Equipment==\nAll of Rocket's superhuman powers derive from the inertia winder installed in her belt buckle.<ref name=Icon2>''Icon'' #2</ref> This device is one of two from Icon's escape pod, the other is installed in [[Hardware (comics)|Hardware]]'s current suit of armor.<ref name=hardware16>''Hardware'' #16</ref> When activated, the inertia winder surrounds Rocket in an \"inertia field,\" which absorbs, stores, and redirects any [[kinetic energy]] used against it.<ref name=Icon2>''Icon'' #2</ref> Rocket's inertia field is normally invisible to the human eye. The field glows purple when it absorbs or releases kinetic energy.<ref name=Icon2>''Icon'' #2</ref>\n\nThe inertia field primarily serves as a [[force shield|force field]] that protects her from anything invested with kinetic energy: physical blows,<ref name=Icon2>''Icon'' #2</ref> bullets,<ref name=Icon2>''Icon'' #2</ref> falls,<ref name=Icon13>''Icon'' #13</ref> etc. The maximum amount of kinetic energy Rocket's inertia field can absorb and store is unknown. However, the field nearly reached its limit during Rocket's battle with Oblivion.<ref name=Icon26>''Icon'' #26</ref>\n\nRocket's inertia field normally extends a few inches from her body,<ref name=Icon2>''Icon'' #2</ref> but she can expand the field to enclose much greater areas. She once used it to protect a small crowd of people without any loss of its durability.<ref name=Icon29>''Icon'' #29</ref>\n\nRocket can release the field's stored energy, giving her a range of offensive abilities. She can strike with superhuman force by surrounding her fists with kinetic energy.<ref name=Icon2>''Icon'' #2</ref> By releasing all the energy in the inertia field, she can stagger powerful beings like Icon with a single blow.<ref name=Icon28>''Icon'' #28</ref> However, such a feat would leave Rocket defenseless so she prefers to throw less powerful punches. Furthermore, Rocket has moral qualms about using her full store of kinetic energy against normal human opponents.\n\nRocket can also use kinetic energy to increase the force with which she hurls an object, turning it into a dangerous projectile.<ref name=Icon2>''Icon'' #2</ref> For example, she once hurled a bullet with enough force to rival a shot from a high-caliber rifle. This ability is limited to objects which she can lift and toss with her normal strength.\n\nBy releasing her store kinetic energy in focus beams, Rocket can project powerful energy blasts from her hands.<ref name=Icon2>''Icon'' #2</ref> As with her kinetic punches, the force of these blasts depends on how much kinetic energy she uses.\n\nRecently, Rocket has learned how to use her inertia winder to surround a target within an \"inertialess field.\"<ref name=Icon39>''Icon'' #39</ref> This field's kinetic energy nullifies the energy of anything trapped within down to the molecular level. As a result, Rocket can use the inertialess field to effectively immobilize her opponents. In fact, some opponents can fall unconscious in as much as the field prevents [[oxygen]] molecules from reaching their lungs. The inertialess field consumes enormous amounts of energy and collapses after a few seconds.<ref name=Icon39>''Icon'' #39</ref>\n\nRocket can fly by releasing her inertia field's kinetic energy beneath her, launching her skyward. Initially, she was not very skilled with this ability and thus could only leap over great distances.<ref name=Icon24>''Icon'' #24</ref> However, after training from Darnice, Rocket can use her kinetic energy as a means of propulsion for genuine flight.<ref name=Icon24>''Icon'' #24</ref> Rocket is capable of flying through narrow corridors and performing complex aerial maneuvers.<ref name=Icon28>''Icon'' #28</ref> She can even hover in midair by releasing controlled bursts of kinetic energy beneath her.<ref name=Icon28>''Icon'' #28</ref>\n\nRocket's inertia field has certain weaknesses due to its very nature. First, the field will not activate if a person or object exerts little kinetic energy against it. This makes Rocket vulnerable to stealth attacks, which rely on slower movements and minimal force.<ref name=Icon14>''Icon'' #14</ref> Second, the inertia field offers little protection against weapons based on non-kinetic energy like thermal (e.g., [[flamethrowers]])<ref name=Icon23>''Icon'' #23</ref> or electrical (e.g., [[tasers]]).<ref name=Icon2>''Icon'' #2</ref> Finally, Rocket will begin to feel the force of attacks directed against the field if it is overloaded as occurred in her battle with Oblivion.<ref name=Icon26>''Icon'' #26</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\nRocket appears in ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'', voiced by [[Kali Troy|Kittie]] in \"Usual Suspects\", \"Auld Acquaintance\" and \"Satisfaction\", and by [[Denise Boutte]] in \"Intervention\". In the episode \"Revelation\", she and Icon are shown helping the Justice League fight off a massive plant creature created by the [[Injustice League]]. She reappears in the episode \"Failsafe\", working alongside [[Roy Harper (comics)|Red Arrow]], [[Zatanna]], [[Garth (comics)|Garth]] and [[Tula (Young Justice)|Tula]] as part of a resistance cell trying to stop an alien invasion. She later appears in \"Misplaced,\" saving a bus on the edge of a bridge. In \"Agendas\", [[Wonder Woman]] nominates Rocket for membership in the Justice League, a sentiment which is echoed by both [[Black Canary]] and [[Hawkwoman]]. However, [[Superman]] rejects this notion on the grounds that she is not old enough to join the League. In \"Usual Suspects\", Rocket joins the Team after Icon is inducted into the Justice League; at the end of the episode she learns that stopping worldwide threat level criminals is a normal day for the team. She helped the rest of the team defeat Vandal Savage and the mind controlled Justice League, notably taking down her mentor and incapacitating Wonder Woman.  She displays an attraction to [[Aqualad (Jackson Hyde)|Aqualad]], and kisses him at the end of \"Auld Acquaintance\". \nShe appears in the second season, set five years after the events of \"Auld Acquaintance\". Now an adult, Rocket is shown as a member of the Justice League alongside her former teammate [[Zatanna]]. Later in the season, Rocket is engaged and throws a bridal shower to celebrate with most of the old and new female members of the League and the Team. In \"Intervention\", Rocket assists Zatanna form a containment field around Blue Beetle as part of a plot to break the Reach's control over him. \nShe appears in ''[[Young Justice: Outsiders]]'', two years later after ''Invasion'', as cameo in \"Princes All\" sitting next to Zatana. In \"Triptych\", Rocket prevents [[Brick (comics)|Brick]] from escaping. In \"Home Fires\", she and her son Amistad join [[Iris West]]'s play date group.\n\n===Video Games===\nRocket appears as a playable character in the video game ''[[Young Justice: Legacy]]'', voiced by [[Cree Summer]].\n\n==Notes==\n* Rocket held [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] views on economic and social issues, which resulted in her often clashing with her [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] partner, [[Icon (comics)|Icon]].  Under her influence, Icon eventually began re-evaluating his views.\n* [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]'s ''[[The Souls of Black Folk]]'' was a major influence in shaping Rocket's liberal views.<ref name=Icon1>''Icon'' #1</ref>\n* Rocket is the first comic book superheroine who is a single teenage mother. The only other one is [[Mirage (DC Comics)|Mirage]], a former member of the Teen Titans. Although [[Stephanie Brown (comics)|Stephanie Brown]], the former [[Batgirl]] and current Spoiler, gave birth at 15, she gave the child up for adoption.<ref name=\"worldofblackheroes.wordpress.com\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Icon (comics)|Icon]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://worldofblackheroes.com/2011/03/09/rocket-raquel-ervin/ World of Black Heroes: Rocket Biography]\n* [http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/r/rocket.htm International Heroes: Rocket]\n* [[DCDatabase:Raquel Ervin (Dakotaverse)|Rocket at the DC Database Project]]\n* [http://www.blacksuperhero.com/exhibithtml/detail.cfm?id=340 Museum of Black Superheroes: Rocket]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n\n{{Milestone Media}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rocket (Comics)}}\n[[Category:Comic book sidekicks]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1993]]\n[[Category:DC Comics female superheroes]]\n[[Category:Black people in comics]]\n[[Category:Female characters in comics]]\n[[Category:African-American superheroes]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Dwayne McDuffie]]\n", "name_user": "Quebec99", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fix duplicate ref names \u2013You can help!", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_(comics)"}

This derives from [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] [[Water well|wells]] of which Wells used to have many, rising through the chalk of the area. The town became Wells-next-the-Sea from ''juxta mare'' in the fourteenth century to distinguish it from other places of the same name. When the [[Wells and Fakenham Railway]] was opened on 1 December 1857, the terminus was given the name of Wells-on-Sea. In 1956 the Wells Urban District Council voted to (re-)adopt the name Wells-next-the-Sea, and this has been the official name since then.<ref>Description of Wells-next-the-Sea [http://www.wellsnextthesea.info/Wellsonsea/WellsWeb/desc.html www.wellsnextthesea.info/Wellsonsea/WellsWeb/desc.html]. Retrieved 28 November 2011.</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe [[North Sea]] is now a mile from the town; the main channel which once wandered through marshes, grazed by sheep for hundreds of years, was confined by earthworks to the west in 1859 when Holkham Estate reclaimed some 800 hectares of saltmarsh north-west of Wells with the building of a mile-long bank.<ref>Nature Reserve : The Beach : Holkham Hall and Estate \u2013 North Norfolk, England [http://www.holkham.co.uk/html/nature_reserve.html www.holkham.co.uk/html/nature_reserve.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215011258/http://www.holkham.co.uk/html/nature_reserve.html |date=15 December 2014 }}</ref> This reclamation was claimed to have reduced the tidal scour though the West Fleet which provided much of the water entered the channel to its north.\n\nBecause the town has no river running through it, it relies on the tides to scour the harbour. The problem of siltation had preoccupied the merchants of the town for hundreds of years and occupied the attentions of various engineers, leading eventually to disputes which came to court in the eighteenth century. [[John Coode (engineer)|Sir John Coode]], who had been knighted for his work on the completion of Portland harbour was recruited to solve its siltation problems in the 1880s. No attempted solution proved permanent. The growth of faster marine traffic whose wake washes at the banks of the marshes has widened the channel and reduced tidal flow further.\n\nThe town has been a seaport since before the fourteenth century when it supplied grain to London and subsequently to the miners of the north east in return for which Wells was supplied with coal. Until the nineteenth century, it was easier to carry bulk cargoes by sea than overland. Wells was also a fishing port: in 1337 it is recorded as having had thirteen fishing boats; next door Holkham had nine. Its mariners brought first herring and then cod from Iceland in quantity between the fifteenth and seventeenth  centuries. The regulation of the harbour in order to preserve its use was by Act of Parliament in 1663; and in 1769 Harbour Commissioners were appointed with powers over vessels entering and leaving (as they still have today). The Quay was substantially rebuilt in 1845 as part of attempts to improve the town. At the same time, Improvement Commissioners were appointed with the task of making the town commodious and attractive to residents and  the burgeoning tourist trade.  As a small port, it built ships until the late nineteenth century; it never transferred to building motor vessels or to steel hulls. The coming of the railway in 1857 reduced the harbour trade but it revived briefly after the Second World War for the import of fertilizer and animal feed. In 1982 there were 258 ship movements into the harbour.<ref>{{cite book | title= Wells next the Sea: a small port in a wide world | author=Arguile, Roger  | year=2014| isbn=978-1-909796-49-2 }}</ref>\n\nWells was also from early days a manufactury of [[malt]]. At its height the town boasted up to twelve [[Malt house|maltings]], having in 1750 contributed a third of the exports of malt from the country, mostly to Holland,  more than any other port save Yarmouth. Eventually, the sole maltsters in the town were F. & G. Smith who bought out the competition around the turn of the nineteenth century.  Seeing falling demand after the Great War they closed the operation down in 1929. Other agriculture-related enterprises were, over the following years,  bought out or closed. The post-war revival of the harbour trade was the last industrial feature of the town until the coming of the wind farms. Small coasters, mostly from across the Channel,{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} brought in fertiliser and animal feed, latterly mostly soya beans, from the late 1960s until 1992 when changes in government regulations and the increasing size of vessels made the port uneconomic. Wind-farm support began in 2009 with the building of the [[Sheringham Shoal Offshore Wind Farm]].\n\n==Geography==\nThe town has long thrived as a seaport and is now also a [[seaside resort]] with a popular beach that can be reached on foot or by a narrow gauge railway that runs partway alongside the mile-long sea wall north of the harbour. The beach is known for its long flat terrain, abstract sand dunes, varied unique [[beach hut]]s and a [[naturist]] area situated to the west at Holkham. A land-locked brackish pool called Abraham's Bosom was for many years used for pleasure boating and canoeing; it is all that remains of the West Fleet which once drained the Holkham marshes. The beach is backed by dense [[pine]] woods which are part of the [[Holkham National Nature Reserve]]. The woods comprise [[Scots pine]], [[Maritime pine]] and [[Corsican Pine]] growing on sand.<ref>Holkham National Nature Reserve [http://www.holkham.co.uk/naturereserve/ holkham.co.uk/naturereserve/]</ref>\n\nMore pinewoods exist to the east of the beach over the shipping channel at an area called the East Hills. This can be accessed on foot at low tide though all of the tidal sands in the area are extremely dangerous due to the speed and currents of the rising tide.  It is not advisable to cross the channel without detailed local knowledge.\n\nThe majority of shops and other such businesses are now found on Staithe Street but up to the 1960s commercial premises were also to be found along High Street which continues south towards St Nicholas's Church. The church burned after a lightning strike in 1879; the exterior shows the original stonework, but the interior, while light and airy, shows the want of stained glass. The Victorian bench ends are worth a look. [[John Fryer (sailor)|John Fryer]], Captain Bligh's [[sailing master]] on [[HMS Bounty|HMS ''Bounty'']] was born at Wells, and is buried in the churchyard. His gravestone is in the church porch.\n\nThe distinctive landmark of the seafront is the granary with its overhanging gantry on the quay, started in 1904 and finished in 1905. This has now been converted into flats, having ceased operating as a granary in 1990. The maritime tradition of the town meant it used to have a remarkable number of public houses for a town of its size although many of these have since closed. The northern end of the town used to be notable for parallel 'yards', narrow rows of cottages similar to the northern '[[ginnel]]s', which may derive from the rebuilding of the port in the eleventh century. (The original port is reputed to have been adjacent to the church.) Most of these remain though some have been lost to development and [[slum clearance]]. The 1953 flood affected the northern edge of the town, breaching the beach bank and causing damage to houses in the east end. It also destroyed the pine woods which had been planted in the nineteenth century to stabilise the dunes and which fringed Abraham's Bosom. Today there is a large moving flood gate next to the harbour car park and many of the houses have their own flood defences.\n\nA feature of the town is the area known as The Buttlands, a large green ringed by lime trees. Large elegant Georgian houses overlook The Buttlands, as do the Crown Hotel, Globe Inn and the Wells Catholic Church. If you exit The Buttlands down the hill at its south-west corner you can see Ware Hall,a medieval house which was rebuilt over a period of years from the 1970s by Miss May Savidge, who brought it in parts when she moved from [[Ware, Hertfordshire|Ware]] in Hertfordshire.<ref>[http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/the_house_that_may_built_1_700239 The house that May built], Eastern Daily Press, 28 November 2007</ref>\n\n[[Wells Harbour]] was a significant port in the sixteenth century with 19 ships over 16 tons burden operating out of Wells in 1580, making it the major port in the area; the main trade was corn.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Port of Wells: 1100 Years of History | author=Pooley, Graham | year=1992 | isbn=978-0-9516120-1-9 }}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n===Railways===\n[[File:Wells next the seamap 1946.png|thumb|250px|right|A map of Wells-next-the-Sea from 1946]]\n[[File:Wells-next-the-sea lifeboat statiion cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Wells-next-the-Sea Lifeboat Station]]]]\n[[File:Wells-next-the-sea lifeboat coming home by Dennis Smith.jpg|thumb|Wells-next-the-Sea lifeboat being towed to the lifeboat house]]\n\nFormerly the town was served by [[Wells-on-Sea railway station]] and was connected to the [[British Rail]] network by two lines. The line westwards towards King's Lynn was never reinstated after damage in the [[North Sea flood of 1953]], while the line to Norwich via Fakenham, Dereham and Wymondham was a victim of the '[[Beeching Axe]]' of the 1960s.

The junior school was relocated to the former Secondary Modern school when a new secondary school, [[Alderman Peel High School]], was built in the late 1960s, part of which is upon the former railway line to the west towards King's Lynn. For several years, these buildings housed a field studies centre.  More recently, though, the former school has been converted to social housing units.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n===Buses===\nWells was located on the high-profile 'Coasthopper' bus route between [[King's Lynn]] and [[Cromer]]. In April 2018, Stagecoach ceased operations in Norfolk. The Coasthopper service was split into two sections at Wells-next-the-Sea: the section from King's Lynn to Wells was rebranded as the ''Coastliner'' 36, extended inland from Wells to [[Fakenham]], and taken over by [[Lynx (bus company)|Lynx]]; while the section from Wells to Cromer was branded as the 4 and taken over by Sanders Coaches.\n\n==Lifeboat==\nThe [[Wells-next-the-Sea Lifeboat Station|current lifeboat station]], housing both an all-weather lifeboat and an inshore rescue boat, is at the harbour entrance. The old lifeboat house, now used as the harbour offices, is at the western end of the quay. A new [[Shannon-class lifeboat|''Shannon''-class lifeboat]] is planned to replace the current boat in 2021 requiring a new much larger lifeboat station; the fate of the current station is uncertain.\n\nIn 1880, in the [[Wells lifeboat disaster]], 11 of the 13 crew drowned, leaving 10 widows and 27 children without fathers.

This derives from [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] [[Water well|wells]] of which Wells used to have many, rising through the chalk of the area. The town became Wells-next-the-Sea from ''juxta mare'' in the fourteenth century to distinguish it from other places of the same name. When the [[Wells and Fakenham Railway]] was opened on 1 December 1857, the terminus was given the name of Wells-on-Sea. In 1956 the Wells Urban District Council voted to (re-)adopt the name Wells-next-the-Sea, and this has been the official name since then.<ref>Description of Wells-next-the-Sea [http://www.wellsnextthesea.info/Wellsonsea/WellsWeb/desc.html www.wellsnextthesea.info/Wellsonsea/WellsWeb/desc.html]. Retrieved 28 November 2011.</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe [[North Sea]] is now a mile from the town; the main channel which once wandered through marshes, grazed by sheep for hundreds of years, was confined by earthworks to the west in 1859 when Holkham Estate reclaimed some 800 hectares of saltmarsh north-west of Wells with the building of a mile-long bank.<ref>Nature Reserve : The Beach : Holkham Hall and Estate \u2013 North Norfolk, England [http://www.holkham.co.uk/html/nature_reserve.html www.holkham.co.uk/html/nature_reserve.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215011258/http://www.holkham.co.uk/html/nature_reserve.html |date=15 December 2014 }}</ref> This reclamation was claimed to have reduced the tidal scour though the West Fleet which provided much of the water entered the channel to its north.\n\nBecause the town has no river running through it, it relies on the tides to scour the harbour. The problem of siltation had preoccupied the merchants of the town for hundreds of years and occupied the attentions of various engineers, leading eventually to disputes which came to court in the eighteenth century. [[John Coode (engineer)|Sir John Coode]], who had been knighted for his work on the completion of Portland harbour was recruited to solve its siltation problems in the 1880s. No attempted solution proved permanent. The growth of faster marine traffic whose wake washes at the banks of the marshes has widened the channel and reduced tidal flow further.\n\nThe town has been a seaport since before the fourteenth century when it supplied grain to London and subsequently to the miners of the north east in return for which Wells was supplied with coal. Until the nineteenth century, it was easier to carry bulk cargoes by sea than overland. Wells was also a fishing port: in 1337 it is recorded as having had thirteen fishing boats; next door Holkham had nine. Its mariners brought first herring and then cod from Iceland in quantity between the fifteenth and seventeenth  centuries. The regulation of the harbour in order to preserve its use was by Act of Parliament in 1663; and in 1769 Harbour Commissioners were appointed with powers over vessels entering and leaving (as they still have today). The Quay was substantially rebuilt in 1845 as part of attempts to improve the town. At the same time, Improvement Commissioners were appointed with the task of making the town commodious and attractive to residents and  the burgeoning tourist trade.  As a small port, it built ships until the late nineteenth century; it never transferred to building motor vessels or to steel hulls. The coming of the railway in 1857 reduced the harbour trade but it revived briefly after the Second World War for the import of fertilizer and animal feed. In 1982 there were 258 ship movements into the harbour.<ref>{{cite book | title= Wells next the Sea: a small port in a wide world | author=Arguile, Roger  | year=2014| isbn=978-1-909796-49-2 }}</ref>\n\nWells was also from early days a manufactury of [[malt]]. At its height the town boasted up to twelve [[Malt house|maltings]], having in 1750 contributed a third of the exports of malt from the country, mostly to Holland,  more than any other port save Yarmouth. Eventually, the sole maltsters in the town were F. & G. Smith who bought out the competition around the turn of the nineteenth century.  Seeing falling demand after the Great War they closed the operation down in 1929. Other agriculture-related enterprises were, over the following years,  bought out or closed. The post-war revival of the harbour trade was the last industrial feature of the town until the coming of the wind farms. Small coasters, mostly from across the Channel,{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} brought in fertiliser and animal feed, latterly mostly soya beans, from the late 1960s until 1992 when changes in government regulations and the increasing size of vessels made the port uneconomic. Wind-farm support began in 2009 with the building of the [[Sheringham Shoal Offshore Wind Farm]].\n\n==Geography==\nThe town has long thrived as a seaport and is now also a [[seaside resort]] with a popular beach that can be reached on foot or by a narrow gauge railway that runs partway alongside the mile-long sea wall north of the harbour. The beach is known for its long flat terrain, abstract sand dunes, varied unique [[beach hut]]s and a [[naturist]] area situated to the west at Holkham. A land-locked brackish pool called Abraham's Bosom was for many years used for pleasure boating and canoeing; it is all that remains of the West Fleet which once drained the Holkham marshes. The beach is backed by dense [[pine]] woods which are part of the [[Holkham National Nature Reserve]]. The woods comprise [[Scots pine]], [[Maritime pine]] and [[Corsican Pine]] growing on sand.<ref>Holkham National Nature Reserve [http://www.holkham.co.uk/naturereserve/ holkham.co.uk/naturereserve/]</ref>\n\nMore pinewoods exist to the east of the beach over the shipping channel at an area called the East Hills. This can be accessed on foot at low tide though all of the tidal sands in the area are extremely dangerous due to the speed and currents of the rising tide.  It is not advisable to cross the channel without detailed local knowledge.\n\nThe majority of shops and other such businesses are now found on Staithe Street but up to the 1960s commercial premises were also to be found along High Street which continues south towards St Nicholas's Church. The church burned after a lightning strike in 1879; the exterior shows the original stonework, but the interior is sparse and lacks interest. [[John Fryer (sailor)|John Fryer]], Captain Bligh's [[sailing master]] on [[HMS Bounty|HMS ''Bounty'']] was born at Wells, and is buried in the churchyard. His gravestone is in the church porch.\n\nThe distinctive landmark of the seafront is the granary with its overhanging gantry on the quay, started in 1904 and finished in 1905. This has now been converted into flats, having ceased operating as a granary in 1990. The maritime tradition of the town meant it used to have a remarkable number of public houses for a town of its size although many of these have since closed. The northern end of the town used to be notable for parallel 'yards', narrow rows of cottages similar to the northern '[[ginnel]]s', which may derive from the rebuilding of the port in the eleventh century.

Most of them cross [[Newark Bay]] or the [[Passaic River]] into [[Hudson County, New Jersey|Hudson]] or [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen]] counties. The [[Newark Bay Bridge]] carries [[Interstate 78 in New Jersey|Interstate 78]] over Newark Bay from Newark to [[Bayonne, New Jersey|Bayonne]] and is currently the most southern bridge crossing the bay. The [[Upper Bay Bridge]], a [[vertical-lift bridge]] located just north of the [[Newark Bay Bridge]], carries a freight train line over the bay from [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] to [[Bayonne, New Jersey|Bayonne]].\n\nThe [[PD Draw]] is an abandoned and partially dismantled railroad bridge across the Passaic River from Newark to [[Kearny, New Jersey|Kearny]]. The [[Lincoln Highway Passaic River Bridge]] carries [[U.S. Route 1/9 Truck|Truck 1/9]] across the Passaic River and is currently the southern most crossing of the river before it reaches the bay. It is a vertical-lift bridge and was the route that the [[Lincoln Highway]] used to cross the river. The [[Pulaski Skyway]], the most famous bridge entirely in New Jersey, carries [[U.S. Route 1/9|Route 1/9]] across the [[Passaic River]], [[Kearny Point]], and the [[Hackensack River]] from Newark through [[Kearny, New Jersey|Kearny]] to [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]].\n\nThe [[Point-No-Point Bridge]] is a railroad [[swing bridge]] that carries a freight line across the Passaic River between Newark and Kearny. The [[Jackson Street Bridge]] is a historic vehicular swing bridge across the Passaic from Newark to [[Harrison, New Jersey|Harrison]].  The [[Dock Bridge]], listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] carries four tracks of the Northeast Corridor rail line and two tracks of the PATH on two vertical lift spans from Newark Penn Station to Harrison.\n\nThe [[New Jersey Route 158|Center Street Bridge]] is a former railroad, rapid transit, and road bridge connecting Newark and Harrison. The [[Bridge Street Bridge (Newark)|Bridge Street Bridge]] is another vehicular swing bridge across the Passaic from Newark to Harrison, as is the [[Clay Street Bridge]], a swing bridge that connects Newark and [[East Newark, New Jersey|East Newark]].\n\n==Municipalities==\n[[Image:Essex County, New Jersey Municipalities.png|thumb|right|400px|Index map of Essex County Municipalities (click to see index key)]]\n\n<mapframe latitude=\"40.7838\" longitude=\"-74.2538\" zoom=\"10\" width=\"300\" height=\"400\" text=\"Interactive map of municipalities in Essex County\">\n{\n  \"type\": \"ExternalData\",\n  \"service\": \"geoshape\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"fill\": \"#07c63e\"\n  },\n  \"query\": \"# Municipalities in Essex County SELECT ?id ?idLabel (CONCAT('[[', ?idLabel, ']]') AS ?title) ?OSM_relation_ID WHERE {  ?id wdt:P131 wd:Q128077.
