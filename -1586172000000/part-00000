{"title_page": "Schubert calculus", "text_new": "{{more footnotes|date=October 2016}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], '''Schubert calculus''' is a branch of [[algebraic geometry]] introduced in the nineteenth century by [[Hermann Schubert]], in order to solve various counting problems of [[projective geometry]] (part of [[enumerative geometry]]). It was a precursor of several more modern theories, for example [[characteristic class]]es, and in particular its algorithmic aspects are still of current interest. The phrase \"Schubert calculus\" is sometimes used to mean the enumerative geometry of linear subspaces, roughly equivalent to describing the cohomology ring of Grassmannians, and sometimes used to mean the more general enumerative geometry of nonlinear varieties. Even more generally, \u201cSchubert calculus\u201d is often understood to encompass the study of analogous questions in [[generalized cohomology theories]].\n\nThe objects introduced by Schubert are the '''Schubert cells''', which are [[locally closed]] sets in a [[Grassmannian]] defined by conditions of [[incidence (geometry)|incidence]] of a linear subspace in projective space with a given [[Flag (linear algebra)|flag]]. For details see [[Schubert variety]].\n\nThe [[intersection theory]] of these cells, which can be seen as the product structure in the [[cohomology ring]] of the Grassmannian of associated [[cohomology class]]es, in principle allows the prediction of the cases where intersections of cells results in a finite set of points, which are potentially concrete answers to enumerative questions. A supporting theoretical result is that the Schubert cells (or rather, their classes) span the whole cohomology ring.\n\nIn detailed calculations the combinatorial aspects enter as soon as the cells have to be indexed. Lifted from the [[Grassmannian]], which is a [[homogeneous space]], to the [[general linear group]] that acts on it, similar questions are involved in the [[Bruhat decomposition]] and classification of [[parabolic subgroup]]s (by [[block matrix]]).\n\nPutting Schubert's system on a rigorous footing is [[Hilbert's fifteenth problem]].\n\n== Construction ==\nSchubert calculus can be constructed using the [[Chow ring]] of the [[Grassmannian]] where the generating cycles are represented by geometrically meaningful data.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=|first=|url=https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/joeharris/files/000-final-3264.pdf|title=3264 and All That|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=132, section 4.1; 200, section 6.2.1}}</ref> Denote <math>G(k,V)</math> as the Grassmannian of <math>k</math>-planes in a fixed <math>n</math>-dimensional vector space <math>V</math>. Note sometimes this is denoted as <math>G(k,n)</math> if the vector space isn't explicitly given. Associated to an arbitrary complete flag <math>\\mathcal{V}</math><blockquote><math>0 \\subset V_1 \\subset \\cdots \\subset V_{n-1} \\subset V_n = V</math></blockquote>and a decreasing <math>k</math>-tuple of integers <math>\\mathbf{a} = (a_1,\\ldots, a_k)</math> where<blockquote><math>n-k \\geq a_1 \\geq a_2 \\geq \\cdots \\geq a_k \\geq 0</math></blockquote>there are '''Schubert cycles''' (which are called '''Schubert cells''' when considering cellular homology instead of the Chow ring) <math>\\Sigma_{\\mathbf{a}}(\\mathcal{V}) \\subset G(k,V)</math> defined as<blockquote><math>\\Sigma_{\\mathbf{a}}(\\mathcal{V}) = \\{ \\Lambda \\in G(k,V) : \\dim (V_{n-k +i - a_i} \\cap \\Lambda) \\geq i \\text{ for all } i \\geq 0   \\}</math></blockquote>Since the class <math>[\\Sigma_{\\mathbb{a}}(\\mathcal{V})] \\in A^*(G(k,V))</math> does not depend on the complete flag, the class can be written as<blockquote><math>\\sigma_{\\mathbb{a}} := [\\Sigma_{\\mathbb{a}}] \\in A^*(G(k,V)) </math></blockquote>which are called '''Schubert classes'''. It can be shown these classes generate the Chow ring, and the associated intersection theory is called '''Schubert calculus'''. Note given a sequence <math>\\mathbb{a} = (a_1,\\ldots, a_j, 0, \\ldots, 0)</math> the Schubert class <math>\\sigma_{(a_1,\\ldots, a_j,0,\\ldots,0)}</math> is typically denoted as just <math>\\sigma_{(a_1,\\ldots, a_j)}</math>. Also, the Schubert classes given by a single integer, <math>\\sigma_{a_1}</math>, are called '''special classes'''. Using the Giambeli formula below, all of the Schubert classes can be generated from these special classes.\n\n=== Explanation of definition ===\nInitially the definition looks a little bit awkward. Given a generic <math>k</math>-plane <math>\\Lambda \\subset V</math> it will have only a zero intersection with <math>V_i</math> for <math>i \\leq n-k</math> and <math>\\dim(V_{n-k+i} \\cap \\Lambda) = i</math> for <math>i > n-k</math>. For example, in <math>G(4,9)</math> given a <math>4</math>-plane <math>\\Lambda</math>, this is cut out by a system of five linear equations. The <math>2</math>-plane <math>V_2</math> is not guaranteed to intersect at anywhere other than the origin since there are five free parameters it could live in. Furthermore, once <math>\\dim(V_i) + \\dim(\\Lambda) > n</math>, then they necessarily intersect. This means, the expected dimension of intersection of <math>V_5</math> and <math>\\Lambda</math> should have dimension <math>1</math>, the intersection of  <math>V_6</math> and <math>\\Lambda</math> should have dimension <math>2</math>, and so on. These cycles then define special subvarieties of <math>G(k,n)</math>.\n\n=== Properties ===\n\n==== Inclusion ====\nThere is a partial ordering on all <math>k</math>-tuples where <math>\\mathbb{a} \\geq \\mathbb{b}</math> if <math>a_i \\geq b_i</math> for every <math>i</math>. This gives the inclusion of Schubert cycles<blockquote><math>\\Sigma_{\\mathbb{a}} \\subset \\Sigma_{\\mathbb{b}} \\iff a \\geq b</math></blockquote>showing an increase of the indices corresponds to an even greater specialization of subvarieties.\n\n==== Codimension formula ====\nA Schubert cycle <math>\\Sigma_{\\mathbb{a}}</math> has codimension<blockquote><math>\\sum a_i</math></blockquote>which is stable under inclusions of Grassmannians. That is, the inclusion<blockquote><math>i: G(k,n) \\hookrightarrow G(k+1,n+1)</math></blockquote>given by adding the extra basis element <math>e_{n+1}</math> to each <math>k</math>-plane, giving a <math>(k+1)</math>-plane, has the property<blockquote><math>i^*(\\sigma_{\\mathbb{a}}) = \\sigma_{\\mathbb{a}}</math></blockquote>Also, the inclusion<blockquote><math>j:G(k,n) \\hookrightarrow G(k,n+1)</math></blockquote>given by inclusion of the <math>k</math>-plane has the same pullback property.\n\n=== Intersection product ===\nThe intersection product was first established using the Pieri and Giambelli formulas.\n\n==== Pieri formula ====\nIn the special case <math>\\mathbb{b} = (b,0,\\ldots, 0)</math>, there is an explicit formula of the product of <math>\\sigma_b</math> with an arbitrary Schubert class <math>\\sigma_{a_1,\\ldots, a_k}</math> given by<blockquote><math>\\sigma_b\\cdot\\sigma_{a_1,\\ldots, a_k} = \\sum_{\n\\begin{matrix}|c| = |a| + b \\\\\na_i \\leq c_i \\leq a_{i-1}\n\\end{matrix}    \n} \\sigma_{\\mathbb{c}}</math></blockquote>Note <math>|\\mathbb{a}| = a_1 + \\cdots + a_k</math>. This formula is called the '''Pieri formula''' and can be used to determine the intersection product of any two Schubert classes when combined with the Giambelli formula. For example<blockquote><math>\\sigma_1 \\cdot \\sigma_{4,2,1} = \\sigma_{5,2,1} + \\sigma_{4,3,1} + \\sigma_{4,2,1,1} </math></blockquote>and<blockquote><math>\\sigma_2 \\cdot \\sigma_{4,3} = \\sigma_{4,3,2} + \\sigma_{4,4,1} + \\sigma_{5,3,1} + \\sigma_{5,4} + \\sigma_{6,3} </math></blockquote>\n\n==== Giambellia formula ====\nSchubert classes with tuples of length two or more can be described as a determinental equation using the classes of only one tuple. The '''Giambelli formula''' reads as the equation<blockquote><math>\\sigma_{(a_1,\\ldots, a_k)} = \\begin{vmatrix}\n\\sigma_{a_1} & \\sigma_{a_1 + 1} & \\sigma_{a_1 + 2} & \\cdots & \\sigma_{a_1 + k - 1} \\\\\n\\sigma_{a_2 - 1} & \\sigma_{a_2} & \\sigma_{a_2 + 1} & \\cdots & \\sigma_{a_2 + k - 2} \\\\\n\\sigma_{a_3 - 2} & \\sigma_{a_3 - 1} & \\sigma_{a_3} & \\cdots & \\sigma_{a_3 + k - 3} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n\\sigma_{a_k - k + 1} & \\sigma_{a_k - k + 2} & \\sigma_{a_k - k + 3} & \\cdots & \\sigma_{a_k}\n\\end{vmatrix}</math></blockquote>given by the determinant of a <math>(k,k)</math>-matrix. For example,<blockquote><math>\\sigma_{2,2} = \\begin{vmatrix}\n\\sigma_2 & \\sigma_3 \\\\\n\\sigma_1 & \\sigma_2\n\\end{vmatrix} = \\sigma_2^2 - \\sigma_1\\cdot\\sigma_3</math></blockquote>and<blockquote><math>\\sigma_{2,1,1} = \\begin{vmatrix}\n\\sigma_2 & \\sigma_3 & \\sigma_4 \\\\\n\\sigma_0 & \\sigma_1 & \\sigma_2 \\\\\n0 & \\sigma_0 & \\sigma_1\n\\end{vmatrix}</math></blockquote>\n\n== Relation with Chern classes ==\nThere is an easy description of the cohomology ring, or the Chow ring, of the Grassmannian using the Chern classes of two natural vector bundles over the grassmannian <math>G(k,n)</math>. There is a sequence of vector bundles<blockquote><math>0 \\to T \\to \\underline{V} \\to Q \\to 0</math></blockquote>where <math>\\underline{V}</math> is the trivial vector bundle of rank <math>n</math>, the fiber of <math>T</math> over <math>\\Lambda \\in G(k,n)</math> is the subspace <math>\\Lambda \\subset V</math>, and <math>Q</math> is the quotient vector bundle (which exists since the rank is constant on each of the fibers). The Chern classes of these two associated bundles are<blockquote><math>c_i(T) = (-1)^i\\sigma_{(1,\\ldots, 1)}</math></blockquote>where <math>(1,\\ldots, 1)</math> is an <math>i</math>-tuple and<blockquote><math>c_i(Q) = \\sigma_i</math></blockquote>The tautological sequence then gives the presentation of the Chow ring as<blockquote><math>A^*(G(k,n)) = \\frac{\n    \\mathbb{Z}[c_1(T), \\ldots, c_k(T), c_1(Q),\\ldots, c_{n-k}(Q)]\n}{(c(T)c(Q) - 1)}</math></blockquote>\n\n== G(2,4) ==\nOne of the classical examples analyzed is the Grassmannian <math>G(2,4)</math> since it parameterizes lines in <math>\\mathbb{P}^3</math>. Schubert calculus can be used to find the number of lines on a [[Cubic surface]].\n\n=== Chow ring ===\nThe Chow ring has the presentation<blockquote>\n<math>A^*(G(2,4)) = \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}[\\sigma_1,\\sigma_{1,1}, \\sigma_2]}{(1 - \\sigma_1 + \\sigma_{1,1})(1 + \\sigma_1 +  \\sigma_2) = 1}</math></blockquote>\nand as a graded Abelian group it is given by<blockquote><math>\\begin{align}\nA^0(G(2,4)) &= \\mathbb{Z}\\cdot 1 \\\\\nA^2(G(2,4)) &= \\mathbb{Z}\\cdot \\sigma_1 \\\\\nA^4(G(2,4)) &= \\mathbb{Z}\\cdot \\sigma_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\cdot \\sigma_{1,1}\\\\\nA^6(G(2,4)) &= \\mathbb{Z}\\cdot\\sigma_{2,1} \\\\\nA^8(G(2,4)) &= \\mathbb{Z}\\cdot\\sigma_{2,2} \\\\\n\\end{align}</math><ref>{{Cite book|last=Katz|first=Sheldon|title=Enumerative Geometry and String Theory|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=96}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Lines on a cubic surface ===\nThis Chow ring can be used to compute the number of lines on a cubic surface.<ref name=\":0\" /> Recall a line in <math>\\mathbb{P}^3</math> gives a dimension two subspace of <math>\\mathbb{A}^4</math>, hence <math>\\mathbb{G}(1,3) \\cong G(2,4)</math>. Also, the equation of a line can be given as a section of <math>\\Gamma(\\mathbb{G}(1,3), T^*)</math>. Since a cubic surface <math>X</math> is given as a generic homogeneous cubic polynomial, this is given as a generic section <math>s \\in \\Gamma(\\mathbb{G}(1,3),\\text{Sym}^3(T^*))</math>. Then, a line <math>L \\subset \\mathbb{P}^3</math> is a subvariety of <math>X</math> if and only if the section vanishes on <math>[L] \\in \\mathbb{G}(1,3)</math>. Therefore, the [[Euler class]] of <math>\\text{Sym}^3(T^*)</math> can be integrated over <math>\\mathbb{G}(1,3)</math> to get the number of points where the generic section vanishes on <math>\\mathbb{G}(1,3)</math>. In order to get the Euler class, the total Chern class of <math>T^*</math> must be computed, which is given as<blockquote><math>c(T^*) = 1 + \\sigma_1 + \\sigma_{1,1}</math></blockquote>Then, the splitting formula reads as the formal equation<blockquote><math>\\begin{align}\nc(T^*) &= (1 + \\alpha)(1 + \\beta) \\\\\n&= 1 + \\alpha + \\beta + \\alpha\\cdot\\beta\n\\end{align}</math></blockquote>where <math>c(\\mathcal{L}) = 1+\\alpha</math> and <math>c(\\mathcal{M}) = 1 + \\beta</math> for formal line bundles <math>\\mathcal{L},\\mathcal{M}</math>. The splitting equation gives the relations<blockquote><math>\\sigma_1 = \\alpha + \\beta</math> and <math>\\sigma_{1,1} = \\alpha\\cdot\\beta</math>.</blockquote>Since <math>\\text{Sym}^3(T^*)</math> can be read as the direct sum of formal vector bundles<blockquote><math>\\text{Sym}^{3}(T^{*}) = \\mathcal{L}^{\\oplus 3} \\oplus (\\mathcal{L}^{\\oplus 2} \\otimes \\mathcal{M})\n\\oplus(\\mathcal{L}\\otimes\\mathcal{M}^{\\oplus 2})\\oplus \\mathcal{M}^3</math></blockquote>whose total Chern class is<blockquote><math>c(\\text{Sym}^3(T^*)) = (1 + 3\\alpha)(1 + 2\\alpha + \\beta)(1 + \\alpha  + 2\\beta)(1 + 3\\beta)</math></blockquote>hence<blockquote><math>\\begin{align}\nc_4(\\text{Sym}^4(T^*)) &= 3\\alpha (2\\alpha + \\beta) (\\alpha + 2\\beta) 3\\beta \\\\\n&=9\\alpha\\beta(2(\\alpha + \\beta)^2 + \\alpha\\beta) \\\\\n&= 9\\sigma_{1,1}(2\\sigma_1^2 + \\sigma_{1,1}) \\\\\n&= 27\\sigma_{2,2}\n\\end{align}</math></blockquote>using the fact<blockquote><math>\\sigma_{1,1}\\cdot \\sigma_1^2 = \\sigma_{2,1}\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_{2,2}</math> and <math>\\sigma_{1,1}\\cdot \\sigma_{1,1} = \\sigma_{2,2}</math></blockquote>Then, the integral is<blockquote><math>\\int_{\\mathbb{G}(1,3)}27\\sigma_{2,2} = 27</math></blockquote>since <math>\\sigma_{2,2}</math> is the top class. Therefore there are <math>27</math> lines on a cubic surface.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Enumerative geometry]]\n* [[Chow ring]]\n* [[Intersection theory]]\n*[[Grassmannian]]\n* [[CW complex]]\n*[[Giambelli's formula]]\n*[[Pieri's formula]]\n*[[Chern class]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* Summer school notes http://homepages.math.uic.edu/~coskun/poland.html\n*[[Phillip Griffiths]] and [[Joe Harris (mathematician)|Joseph Harris]] (1978), ''Principles of Algebraic Geometry'', Chapter 1.5\n* {{cite book | editor=Felix E.

Schubert calculus can be used to find the number of lines on a [[Cubic surface]].\n\n=== Chow ring ===\nThe Chow ring has the presentation<blockquote>\n<math>A^*(G(2,4)) = \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}[\\sigma_1,\\sigma_{1,1}, \\sigma_2]}{(1 - \\sigma_1 + \\sigma_{1,1})(1 + \\sigma_1 +  \\sigma_2) = 1}</math></blockquote>\nand as a graded Abelian group it is given by<blockquote><math>\\begin{align}\nA^0(G(2,4)) &= \\mathbb{Z}\\cdot 1 \\\\\nA^2(G(2,4)) &= \\mathbb{Z}\\cdot \\sigma_1 \\\\\nA^4(G(2,4)) &= \\mathbb{Z}\\cdot \\sigma_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\cdot \\sigma_{1,1}\\\\\nA^6(G(2,4)) &= \\mathbb{Z}\\cdot\\sigma_{2,1} \\\\\nA^8(G(2,4)) &= \\mathbb{Z}\\cdot\\sigma_{2,2} \\\\\n\\end{align}</math><ref>{{Cite book|last=Katz|first=Sheldon|title=Enumerative Geometry and String Theory|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=96}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Lines on a cubic surface ===\nThis Chow ring can be used to compute the number of lines on a cubic surface<ref name=\":0\" />. Recall a line in <math>\\mathbb{P}^3</math> gives a dimension two subspace of <math>\\mathbb{A}^4</math>, hence <math>\\mathbb{G}(1,3) \\cong G(2,4)</math>. Also, the equation of a line can be given as a section of <math>\\Gamma(\\mathbb{G}(1,3), T^*)</math>. Since a cubic surface <math>X</math> is given as a generic homogeneous cubic polynomial, this is given as a generic section <math>s \\in \\Gamma(\\mathbb{G}(1,3),\\text{Sym}^3(T^*))</math>. Then, a line <math>L \\subset \\mathbb{P}^3</math> is a subvariety of <math>X</math> if and only if the section vanishes on <math>[L] \\in \\mathbb{G}(1,3)</math>. Therefore, the [[Euler class]] of <math>\\text{Sym}^3(T^*)</math> can be integrated over <math>\\mathbb{G}(1,3)</math> to get the number of points where the generic section vanishes on <math>\\mathbb{G}(1,3)</math>. In order to get the Euler class, the total Chern class of <math>T^*</math> must be computed, which is given as<blockquote><math>c(T^*) = 1 + \\sigma_1 + \\sigma_{1,1}</math></blockquote>Then, the splitting formula reads as the formal equation<blockquote><math>\\begin{align}\nc(T^*) &= (1 + \\alpha)(1 + \\beta) \\\\\n&= 1 + \\alpha + \\beta + \\alpha\\cdot\\beta\n\\end{align}</math></blockquote>where <math>c(\\mathcal{L}) = 1+\\alpha</math> and <math>c(\\mathcal{M}) = 1 + \\beta</math> for formal line bundles <math>\\mathcal{L},\\mathcal{M}</math>. The splitting equation gives the relations<blockquote><math>\\sigma_1 = \\alpha + \\beta</math> and <math>\\sigma_{1,1} = \\alpha\\cdot\\beta</math>.</blockquote>Since <math>\\text{Sym}^3(T^*)</math> can be read as the direct sum of formal vector bundles<blockquote><math>\\text{Sym}^{3}(T^{*}) = \\mathcal{L}^{\\oplus 3} \\oplus (\\mathcal{L}^{\\oplus 2} \\otimes \\mathcal{M})\n\\oplus(\\mathcal{L}\\otimes\\mathcal{M}^{\\oplus 2})\\oplus \\mathcal{M}^3</math></blockquote>whose total Chern class is<blockquote><math>c(\\text{Sym}^3(T^*)) = (1 + 3\\alpha)(1 + 2\\alpha + \\beta)(1 + \\alpha  + 2\\beta)(1 + 3\\beta)</math></blockquote>hence<blockquote><math>\\begin{align}\nc_4(\\text{Sym}^4(T^*)) &= 3\\alpha (2\\alpha + \\beta) (\\alpha + 2\\beta) 3\\beta \\\\\n&=9\\alpha\\beta(2(\\alpha + \\beta)^2 + \\alpha\\beta) \\\\\n&= 9\\sigma_{1,1}(2\\sigma_1^2 + \\sigma_{1,1}) \\\\\n&= 27\\sigma_{2,2}\n\\end{align}</math></blockquote>using the fact<blockquote><math>\\sigma_{1,1}\\cdot \\sigma_1^2 = \\sigma_{2,1}\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_{2,2}</math> and <math>\\sigma_{1,1}\\cdot \\sigma_{1,1} = \\sigma_{2,2}</math></blockquote>Then, the integral is<blockquote><math>\\int_{\\mathbb{G}(1,3)}27\\sigma_{2,2} = 27</math></blockquote>since <math>\\sigma_{2,2}</math> is the top class. Therefore there are <math>27</math> lines on a cubic surface.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Enumerative geometry]]\n* [[Chow ring]]\n* [[Intersection theory]]\n*[[Grassmannian]]\n* [[CW complex]]\n*[[Giambelli's formula]]\n*[[Pieri's formula]]\n*[[Chern class]]\n\n==References==\n\n* Summer school notes http://homepages.math.uic.edu/~coskun/poland.html\n\n*[[Phillip Griffiths]] and [[Joe Harris (mathematician)|Joseph Harris]] (1978), ''Principles of Algebraic Geometry'', Chapter 1.5\n* {{cite book | editor=Felix E.

[[DXP reductoisomerase]] reduces and rearranges the molecules within DXP<ref name=\":0\" /> in the presence of [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate|NADPH]],<ref name=\":1\" /> forming MEP.<ref name=\":0\" /> Next, MEP is converted to 4-(cytidine 5\u2019-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol (CDP-ME) in the presence of CTP via the enzyme MEP cytidylyltransferase. CDP-ME is then converted, in the presence of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], to 2-phospho-4-(cytidine 5\u2019-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol (CDP-ME2P). The conversion to CDP-ME2P is catalyzed by the enzyme [[4-(cytidine 5'-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase|CDP-ME kinase]]. Next, CDP-ME2P is converted to 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate (MECDP). This reaction occurs when MECDP synthase catalyzes the reaction and CMP is eliminated from the CDP-ME2P molecule. MECDP is then converted to (e)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate (HMBDP) via [[4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate synthase|HMBDP synthase]] in the presence of [[flavodoxin]] and NADPH.

The central double bond of this tri-cis-\u03b6-carotene is isomerized by the [[zeta-carotene isomerase]] Z-ISO and the resulting 9,9'-di-cis-\u03b6-carotene is dehydrogenated again via a [[9,9'-Dicis-zeta-carotene desaturase|\u03b6-carotene desaturase (ZDS)]]. This again introduces two double bonds, resulting in 7,9,7\u2019,9\u2019-tetra-cis-lycopene. [[CRTISO]], a carotenoid isomerase, is needed to convert the [[Cis\u2013trans isomerism|cis]]-lycopene into an [[Cis\u2013trans isomerism|all-trans]] lycopene in the presence of reduced [[Flavin adenine dinucleotide|FAD]].\n\nThis all-trans lycopene is cyclized; [[Cyclic compound|cyclization]] gives rise to carotenoid diversity, which can be distinguished based on the end groups. There can be either a [[Beta-ring|beta ring]] or an epsilon ring, each generated by a different enzyme ([[lycopene beta-cyclase]]  [beta-LCY] or [[lycopene epsilon-cyclase]] [epsilon-LCY]). [[Alpha-Carotene|Alpha-carotene]] is produced when the all-trans lycopene first undergoes reaction with epsilon-LCY then a second reaction with beta-LCY; whereas [[Beta-Carotene|beta-carotene]] is produced by two reactions with beta-LCY.

Structurally, carotenoids take the form of a [[polyene]] hydrocarbon chain which is sometimes terminated by rings, and may or may not have additional oxygen atoms attached.\n* Carotenoids with molecules containing oxygen, such as [[lutein]] and [[zeaxanthin]], are known as '''[[xanthophyll]]s'''.\n* The unoxygenated (oxygen free) carotenoids such as [[alpha-Carotene|\u03b1-carotene]], [[beta-Carotene|\u03b2-carotene]], and [[lycopene]], are known as '''[[carotene]]s'''. Carotenes typically contain only carbon and hydrogen (i.e., are [[hydrocarbon]]s), and are in the subclass of [[unsaturated hydrocarbon]]s.\n\nTheir color, ranging from pale yellow through bright orange to deep red, is directly linked to their structure. Xanthophylls are often yellow, hence their class name. The [[Double bond|double carbon-carbon bonds]] interact with each other in a process called [[Conjugated system|conjugation]], which allows electrons in the molecule to move freely across these areas of the molecule. As the number of conjugated double bonds increases, electrons associated with conjugated systems have more room to move, and require less energy to change states. This causes the range of energies of light absorbed by the molecule to decrease. As more wavelengths of light are absorbed from the longer end of the visible spectrum, the compounds acquire an increasingly red appearance.\n\nCarotenoids are usually [[lipophilic]] due to the presence of long [[Saturated and unsaturated compounds|unsaturated]] [[aliphatic]] chains as in some [[fatty acid]]s.

CDP-ME is then converted, in the presence of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], to 2-phospho-4-(cytidine 5\u2019-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol (CDP-ME2P). The conversion to CDP-ME2P is catalyzed by the enzyme [[4-(cytidine 5'-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase|CDP-ME kinase]]. Next, CDP-ME2P is converted to 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate (MECDP). This reaction occurs when MECDP synthase catalyzes the reaction and CMP is eliminated from the CDP-ME2P molecule. MECDP is then converted to (e)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate (HMBDP) via [[4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate synthase|HMBDP synthase]] in the presence of [[flavodoxin]] and NADPH.

The central double bond of this tri-cis-\u03b6-carotene is isomerized by the [[zeta-carotene isomerase]] Z-ISO and the resulting 9,9'-di-cis-\u03b6-carotene is dehydrogenated again via a [[9,9'-Dicis-zeta-carotene desaturase|\u03b6-carotene desaturase (ZDS)]]. This again introduces two double bonds, resulting in 7,9,7\u2019,9\u2019-tetra-cis-lycopene. [[CRTISO]], a carotenoid isomerase, is needed to convert the [[Cis\u2013trans isomerism|cis]]-lycopene into an [[Cis\u2013trans isomerism|all-trans]] lycopene in the presence of reduced [[Flavin adenine dinucleotide|FAD]].\n\nThis all-trans lycopene is cyclized; [[Cyclic compound|cyclization]] gives rise to carotenoid diversity, which can be distinguished based on the end groups.

Structurally, carotenoids take the form of a [[polyene]] hydrocarbon chain which is sometimes terminated by rings, and may or may not have additional oxygen atoms attached.\n* Carotenoids with molecules containing oxygen, such as [[lutein]] and [[zeaxanthin]], are known as '''[[xanthophyll]]s'''.\n* The unoxygenated (oxygen free) carotenoids such as [[alpha-Carotene|\u03b1-carotene]], [[beta-Carotene|\u03b2-carotene]], and [[lycopene]], are known as '''[[carotene]]s'''. Carotenes typically contain only carbon and hydrogen (i.e., are [[hydrocarbon]]s), and are in the subclass of [[unsaturated hydrocarbon]]s.\n\nTheir color, ranging from pale yellow through bright orange to deep red, is directly linked to their structure. Xanthophylls are often yellow, hence their class name. The [[Double bond|double carbon-carbon bonds]] interact with each other in a process called [[Conjugated system|conjugation]], which allows electrons in the molecule to move freely across these areas of the molecule. As the number of conjugated double bonds increases, electrons associated with conjugated systems have more room to move, and require less energy to change states. This causes the range of energies of light absorbed by the molecule to decrease. As more wavelengths of light are absorbed from the longer end of the visible spectrum, the compounds acquire an increasingly red appearance.\n\nCarotenoids are usually [[lipophilic]] due to the presence of long [[Saturated and unsaturated compounds|unsaturated]] [[aliphatic]] chains as in some [[fatty acid]]s. The physiological absorption of these [[fat-soluble vitamin]]s in humans and other organisms depends directly on the presence of fats and [[bile salt]]s.<ref name=lpi/>\n\n==Foods==\n[[Beta-carotene]], found in [[pumpkin]]s, [[sweet potato]], [[carrot]]s and [[winter squash]], is responsible for their orange-yellow colors.<ref name=lpi/> Dried carrots have the highest amount of carotene of any food per 100 gram serving, measured in retinol activity equivalents (provitamin A equivalents).<ref>{{Cite web|title = Foods Highest in Retinol Activity Equivalent|url = http://nutritiondata.self.com/foods-000100000000000000000-w.html|website = nutritiondata.self.com|accessdate = 2015-12-04}}</ref> Vietnamese [[gac]] fruit contains the highest known concentration of the carotenoid [[lycopene]].<ref>{{cite journal|pmc=4779482|year=2015|author1=Tran|first1=X.

Not only is real-time RT-PCR now the method of choice for quantification of gene expression, it is also the preferred method of obtaining results from [[Microarray analysis techniques|array analyses]] and gene expressions on a global scale. Currently, there are four different fluorescent DNA probes available for the real-time RT-PCR detection of PCR products: [[SYBR Green]], [[TaqMan]], [[molecular beacon]]s, and [[scorpion probe]]s. All of these probes allow the detection of PCR products by generating a fluorescent signal. While the SYBR Green dye emits its fluorescent signal simply by binding to the double-stranded DNA in solution, the TaqMan probes', molecular beacons' and scorpions' generation of fluorescence depend on [[F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer|F\u00f6rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)]] coupling of the dye molecule and a quencher moiety to the oligonucleotide substrates.<ref>{{Cite book | last1 = Holden | first1 = M.

The intensity of the fluorescence increases as the PCR products accumulate. This technique is easy to use since designing of probes is not necessary given lack of specificity of its binding. However, since the dye does not discriminate the double-stranded DNA from the PCR products and those from the primer-dimers, overestimation of the target concentration is a common problem. Where accurate quantification is an absolute necessity, further assay for the validation of results must be performed. Nevertheless, among the real-time RT-PCR product detection methods, SYBR Green is the most economical and easiest to use.<ref name=\"pmid11017702\"/><ref name=\"pmid11227069\"/>\n[[File:Taqman.png|thumb|Taqman probes]]\n; [[TaqMan]] probes: TaqMan probes are oligonucleotides that have a fluorescent probe attached to the 5' end and a quencher to the 3' end. During PCR amplification, these probes will hybridize to the target sequences located in the [[amplicon]] and as polymerase replicates the template with TaqMan bound, it also cleaves the fluorescent probe due to polymerase 5'- nuclease activity. Because the close proximity between the quench molecule and the fluorescent probe normally prevents fluorescence from being detected through FRET, the decoupling results in the increase of intensity of fluorescence proportional to the number of the probe cleavage cycles. Although well-designed TaqMan probes produce accurate real-time RT-PCR results, it is expensive and time-consuming to synthesize when separate probes must be made for each mRNA target analyzed.<ref name=\"pmid11017702\"/><ref name=\"pmid18645596\"/><ref name=\"pmid15613819\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Yang DK, Kweon CH, Kim BH, etal |title=TaqMan reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for the detection of Japanese encephalitis virus |journal=J.

However, whereas the TaqMan fluorescent probes are cleaved during amplification, molecular beacon probes remain intact and rebind to a new target during each reaction cycle. When free in solution, the close proximity of the fluorescent probe and the quencher molecule prevents fluorescence through FRET. However, when molecular beacon probes hybridize to a target, the fluorescent dye and the quencher are separated resulting in the emittance of light upon excitation. As is with the TaqMan probes, molecular beacons are expensive to synthesize and require separate probes for each RNA target.<ref name=\"pmid16060372\"/>\n; [[Scorpion probe]]s: The scorpion probes, like molecular beacons, will not be fluorescent active in an unhybridized state, again, due to the fluorescent probe on the 5' end being quenched by the moiety on the 3' end of an oligonucleotide. With Scorpions, however, the 3' end also contains sequence that is complementary to the extension product of the primer on the 5' end. When the Scorpion extension binds to its complement on the amplicon, the Scorpion structure opens, prevents FRET, and enables the fluorescent signal to be measured.<ref name=\"pmid15240248\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Sharkey FH, Banat IM, Marchant R |title=Detection and quantification of gene expression in environmental bacteriology |journal=Appl.

Not only is real-time RT-PCR now the method of choice for quantification of gene expression, it is also the preferred method of obtaining results from [[Microarray analysis techniques|array analyses]] and gene expressions on a global scale. Currently, there are four different fluorescent DNA probes available for the real-time RT-PCR detection of PCR products: [[SYBR Green]], [[TaqMan]], [[molecular beacon]]s, and [[scorpion probe]]s. All of these probes allow the detection of PCR products by generating a fluorescent signal. While the SYBR Green dye emits its fluorescent signal simply by binding to the double-stranded DNA in solution, the TaqMan probes', molecular beacons' and scorpions' generation of fluorescence depend on [[F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer|F\u00f6rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)]] coupling of the dye molecule and a quencher moiety to the oligonucleotide substrates.<ref>{{Cite book | last1 = Holden | first1 = M.

The intensity of the fluorescence increases as the PCR products accumulate. This technique is easy to use since designing of probes is not necessary given lack of specificity of its binding. However, since the dye does not discriminate the double-stranded DNA from the PCR products and those from the primer-dimers, overestimation of the target concentration is a common problem. Where accurate quantification is an absolute necessity, further assay for the validation of results must be performed. Nevertheless, among the real-time RT-PCR product detection methods, SYBR Green is the most economical and easiest to use.<ref name=\"pmid11017702\"/><ref name=\"pmid11227069\"/>\n[[File:Taqman.png|thumb|Taqman probes]]\n; [[TaqMan]] probes: TaqMan probes are oligonucleotides that have a fluorescent probe attached to the 5' end and a quencher to the 3' end. During PCR amplification, these probes will hybridize to the target sequences located in the [[amplicon]] and as polymerase replicates the template with TaqMan bound, it also cleaves the fluorescent probe due to polymerase 5'- nuclease activity. Because the close proximity between the quench molecule and the fluorescent probe normally prevents fluorescence from being detected through FRET, the decoupling results in the increase of intensity of fluorescence proportional to the number of the probe cleavage cycles. Although well-designed TaqMan probes produce accurate real-time RT-PCR results, it is expensive and time-consuming to synthesize when separate probes must be made for each mRNA target analyzed.<ref name=\"pmid11017702\"/><ref name=\"pmid18645596\"/><ref name=\"pmid15613819\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Yang DK, Kweon CH, Kim BH, etal |title=TaqMan reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for the detection of Japanese encephalitis virus |journal=J.

However, whereas the TaqMan fluorescent probes are cleaved during amplification, molecular beacon probes remain intact and rebind to a new target during each reaction cycle. When free in solution, the close proximity of the fluorescent probe and the quencher molecule prevents fluorescence through FRET. However, when molecular beacon probes hybridize to a target, the fluorescent dye and the quencher are separated resulting in the emittance of light upon excitation. As is with the TaqMan probes, molecular beacons are expensive to synthesize and require separate probes for each RNA target.<ref name=\"pmid16060372\"/>\n; [[Scorpion probe]]s: The scorpion probes, like molecular beacons, will not be fluorescent active in an unhybridized state, again, due to the fluorescent probe on the 5' end being quenched by the moiety on the 3' end of an oligonucleotide. With Scorpions, however, the 3' end also contains sequence that is complementary to the extension product of the primer on the 5' end. When the Scorpion extension binds to its complement on the amplicon, the Scorpion structure opens, prevents FRET, and enables the fluorescent signal to be measured.<ref name=\"pmid15240248\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Sharkey FH, Banat IM, Marchant R |title=Detection and quantification of gene expression in environmental bacteriology |journal=Appl.

RT-PCR is widely used in the diagnosis of genetic diseases and, semiquantitatively, in the determination of the abundance of specific different RNA molecules within a cell or tissue as a measure of [[Gene expression#Techniques and tools|gene expression]].\n\n=== Research methods ===\n\nRT-PCR is commonly used in research methods to measure gene expression. For example, Lin et al. used qRT-PCR to measure expression of Gal genes in yeast cells. First, Lin et al. engineered a mutation of a protein suspected to participate in the regulation of Gal genes. This mutation was hypothesized to selectively abolish Gal expression. To confirm this, gene expression levels of yeast cells containing this mutation were analyzed using qRT-PCR. The researchers were able to conclusively determine that the mutation of this regulatory protein reduced Gal expression.<ref name=\"pmid22308403\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Lin L, Chamberlain L, Zhu LJ, Green MR | title = Analysis of Gal4-directed transcription activation using Tra1 mutants selectively defective for interaction with Gal4 | journal = Proc.

Because most eukaryotic genes contain [[introns]], which are present in the genome but not in the mature mRNA, the cDNA generated from a RT-PCR reaction is the exact (without regard to the error-prone nature of reverse transcriptases) DNA sequence that would be directly translated into [[protein]] after [[transcription]]. When these genes are expressed in prokaryotic cells for the sake of protein production or purification, the RNA produced directly from transcription need not undergo splicing as the transcript contains only [[exons]].

It was fought on 19 September 1356 in Nouaill\u00e9, near the city of [[Poitiers]] in [[Aquitaine]], western France. [[Edward, the Black Prince]], led an army of [[Kingdom of England|English]], [[Principality of Wales|Welsh]], [[Duchy of Brittany|Breton]] and [[Duchy of Gascony|Gascon]] troops, many of them veterans of the [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]]. They were attacked by a larger French force led by [[King John II of France]], which included allied [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scottish]] forces. The French were heavily defeated; an English counter-attack captured King John, along with [[Philip the Bold|his youngest son]], and much of the French nobility who were present.{{sfn|Blockmans|Prevenier|1999|pp=14\u201315}}\n\nThe effect of the defeat on France was catastrophic, leaving [[Charles V of France|Dauphin Charles]] to rule the country. Charles faced [[Jacquerie|populist revolts across the kingdom]] in the wake of the battle, which had destroyed the prestige of the French upper-class. The Edwardian phase of the war ended four years later in 1360, [[Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny|on favourable terms for England]].\n\nPoitiers was the second major English victory of the [[Hundred Years' War]], coming a decade after the [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]] and about half a century before the [[Battle of Agincourt]]. The town and battle were often referred to as ''Poictiers'' in contemporaneous recordings, a name commemorated by [[HMS Poictiers|several warships of the Royal Navy]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Kendall B.

Edward had been reluctant to pay homage to Philip in his role as [[Duke of Aquitaine]], resulting in Philip's confiscation of those lands in 1337, an act which provoked war between the two nations. Three years later, Edward declared himself [[King of France]]. The war had begun well for the English. They had achieved naval domination early in the conflict at the [[Battle of Sluys]] in 1340,<ref>Henri de Wailly. Introduction by Emmanuel Bourassin, ''Crecy 1346: Anatomy of a Battle'' (Blandford Press, Poole, Dorset 1987) p. 10</ref> devastated the south west of France during the [[Gascon campaign of 1345]] and [[Lancaster's chevauch\u00e9e of 1346|Lancaster's chevauch\u00e9e]] the following year, inflicted a severe defeat on the French army at [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy|Cr\u00e9cy]] in 1346, and [[Siege of Calais (1346\u20131347)|captured Calais in 1347]].\n\nIn the late 1340s and early 1350s, the [[Black Death]] had devastated the population of Western Europe, even claiming Philip's wife, [[Joan the Lame|Queen Joan]], as well as one of Edward's daughters, also named [[Joan of England|Joan]]; due to the disruption caused by the plague, all significant military campaigning was brought to a halt. Philip himself died in 1350, and was succeeded by his son, who was crowned King John II. In 1355, Edward III laid out plans for a second major campaign. His eldest son, [[Edward, the Black Prince]], now an experienced soldier following the Cr\u00e9cy campaign, landed at [[Bordeaux]] in Aquitaine, leading his army on a march through southern France to [[Carcassonne]]. Unable to take the heavily fortified settlement, Edward withdrew back to Bordeaux. In early 1356, the [[Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster|Duke of Lancaster]] led an army through [[Normandy]], while Edward led his army on a great [[chevauch\u00e9e]] from Bordeaux on 8 August 1356.<ref>William W. Lace, ''The Hundred Years' War'' {{ISBN|978-1-56006-233-2}}, 1/1994</ref>\n\nEdward's forces met little resistance, sacking numerous settlements, until they reached the [[Loire]] river at [[Tours]]. They were unable to take the castle or burn the town due to a heavy rainstorm. This delay allowed King John to attempt to pin down and destroy Edward's army. John, who had been besieging [[Breteuil, Eure|Breteuil]] in [[Normandy]], organised the bulk of his army at [[Chartres]] to the north of Tours. In order to increase the speed of his army's march, he dismissed between 15,000 and 20,000 of his lower quality infantry, just as Edward turned back to Bordeaux.<ref>Jonathan Sumption, ''The Hundred Years' War: Vol. 2: Trial by Fire'' (London: Faber, 2001), pp. 223, 227\u2013228</ref> The French rode hard and cut in front of the English army, crossing the bridge over the Vienne at Chauvigny. Learning of this, the Black Prince quickly moved his army south.

He deployed his front line of longbowmen behind a particularly prominent thick hedge, through which the road ran at right angles. The Earl of Douglas, commanding the Scottish division in the French army, advised King John that the attack should be delivered on foot, with horses being particularly vulnerable to English arrows. John heeded this advice, his army leaving its baggage behind and forming up on foot in front of the English. The English gained vantage points on the natural high ground in order for their longbowmen to have an advantage over the heavily armoured French troops.{{citation needed|date = September 2018}}\n\n==== English army ====\nThe English army was led by [[Edward, the Black Prince]], and composed primarily of English and Welsh troops, though there was a large contingent of [[Duchy of Gascony|Gascon]] and [[Duchy of Brittany|Breton]] soldiers with the army. Edward's army consisted of approximately 2,000 [[longbow]]men, 3,000 [[men-at-arms]], and a force of 1,000 Gascon infantry.\n\nLike the earlier engagement at [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy|Cr\u00e9cy]], the power of the English army lay in the [[longbow]], a tall, thick self-bow made of yew. Longbows had demonstrated their effectiveness against massed infantry and cavalry in several battles, such as [[Battle of Falkirk|Falkirk]] in 1298, [[Battle of Halidon Hill|Halidon Hill]] in 1333, and [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy|Cr\u00e9cy]] in 1346. Poitiers was the second of three major English victories of the [[Hundred Years' War]] attributed to the longbow, though its effectiveness against armoured French knights and men-at-arms has been disputed.<ref>{{cite book|last1 = Strickland|first1= Matthew|last2= Hardy|first2= Robert|date= 2005|pages= 272\u2013278|title = The Great Warbow: From Hastings to the Mary Rose|publisher = Sutton Publishing|isbn = 9780750931670}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|ref=harv |last=Kaiser |first=Robert E. |date=December 2003 |title=Medieval Military Surgery |journal=Medieval History Magazine|volume=1 |issue=4 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rogers |first1=Clifford J.|title=The Efficacy of the Medieval Longbow: A Reply to Kelly DeVries|journal=War in History|date=1998|volume=5|issue=2 |pages= 233\u201342 |url=https://www.academia.edu/13146838/_The_Efficacy_of_the_Medieval_Longbow_A_Reply_to_Kelly_DeVries_War_in_History_5_no._2_1998_233-42}}</ref>\n\n[[Geoffrey the Baker]] wrote that the English archers under the Earl of Salisbury \"made their arrows prevail over the [French] knights' armour\",<ref>Edward Maunde Thompson, ''Chronicle of Geoffrey le Baker'', (Oxford at the Clarendon Press 1889) p. 147 (\"''coegerunt sagittas armis militaribus prevalere''\")</ref> but the bowmen on the other flank, under Warwick, were initially ineffective against the mounted French men-at-arms who enjoyed the double protection of steel plate armour and large leather shields.<ref>{{cite book|last=Barber|first=Richard|title=The Life and Campaigns of the Black Prince|year=1986|publisher=Boydell Press|location=Woodbridge|isbn=0-85115-435-2|page=76}}</ref> Once Warwick's archers redeployed to a position where they could hit the unarmored sides and backs of the horses, however, they quickly routed the cavalry force opposing them.

Green, ''The Battle of Poitiers 1356'', (Tempus Publishing, Charleston, S.C., 2002)</ref><ref>Edward Maunde Thompson, ''Chronicle of Geoffrey le Baker'', (Oxford at the Clarendon Press 1889) p. 304</ref>\n\nThe English army was an experienced force; many archers were veterans of the earlier [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]], and two of the key commanders, [[John Chandos|Sir John Chandos]], and [[Jean III de Grailly, captal de Buch|Captal de Buch]] were both experienced soldiers. The English army's divisions were led by [[Edward, the Black Prince]], the [[Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]], the [[William de Montagu, 2nd Earl of Salisbury|Earl of Salisbury]], Sir John Chandos and [[Jean III de Grailly, captal de Buch|Captal de Buch]].\n\n==== French army ====\nThe French army was led by King John, and was composed largely of native French soldiers, though there was a contingent of [[Holy Roman Empire|German knights]], and a large force of [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scottish]] soldiers. The latter force was led by the [[William Douglas, 1st Earl of Douglas|Earl of Douglas]] and fought in the King's own division.<ref>William F. Skene, ''John of Fordun\u2019s Chronicle of the Scottish Nation'', (Edinburgh Edmonston and Douglas 1872), p. 365</ref> The French army at the battle comprised approximately 8,000 men-at-arms and 3,000 common infantry, though John had made the decision to leave behind the vast majority of his infantry, numbering up to 20,000, in order to overtake and force the English to battle.\n\nThe French army was arrayed in three \"battles\" or divisions. The vanguard was led by the [[Charles V of France|Dauphin Charles]], the second by the [[Philip, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], while the third, the largest, was led by the King himself.\n\n=== Negotiations ===\nPrior to the battle, the local prelate, [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[H\u00e9lie de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord (cardinal)|H\u00e9lie de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord]] attempted to broker a truce between the two sides, as recorded in the writings of the English commander, Sir John Chandos.<ref>Mildred K. Pope; Eleanor C. Lodge, ''Life of the Black Prince by the Herald of Sir John Chandos'' (Oxford, UK Clarendon Press 1910), p. 857</ref> Attending the conference on the French side were King John, the [[Earl of Tankerville|Count of Tankerville]], the Archbishop of Sens, and [[Jean II de Talaru|Jean de Talaru]]. Representing the English were the [[Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]], the [[Robert d'Ufford, 1st Earl of Suffolk|Earl of Suffolk]], [[Bartholomew de Burghersh, 2nd Baron Burghersh|Bartholomew de Burghersh]], [[James Audley]], and Sir John Chandos. The English offered to hand over all of the war booty they had taken on their raids throughout France, as well as a seven-year truce. John, who believed his force could easily overwhelm the English, declined their proposal. John's counter suggestion that the Black Prince and his army should surrender was flatly rejected.\n\n=== Fighting begins ===\n[[File:Battle of Poitiers 1356 map-en.svg|300px|thumb|Map of the battle]]\n\nAt the start of the battle, the English removed their [[Wagon train|baggage train]] from the field, prompting a hasty French assault, believing that what they saw was the English retreating.<ref name=\"MM99\">{{cite book|ref=harv |last=Urban |first=William L. |year=2006|title=Medieval Mercenaries: The Business of War|publisher=Greenhill Books |location=London|page=99}}</ref> The fighting began with a charge by a [[forlorn hope]] of 300 [[Holy Roman Empire|German]] knights, led by [[Jean de Clermont]]. The attack was a disaster, with many of the knights shot down or killed by English soldiery. According to [[Froissart's Chronicles|Froissart]], the English archers then shot their bows at the massed French infantry.<ref>https://www.britishbattles.com/one-hundred-years-war/battle-of-poitiers/</ref> The Dauphin's division reached the English line. Exhausted by a long march in heavy equipment and harassed by the hail of arrows, the division was repulsed after approximately two hours of combat.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://home.eckerd.edu/~oberhot/poitiers.htm |title=Battle of Poitiers |first=Tom |last=Oberhofer |publisher=[[Eckerd College]] |access-date=2018-09-17 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe retreating vanguard collided with the advancing division of the [[Philip, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], throwing the French army into chaos. Seeing the Dauphin's troops falling back, Orl\u00e9ans' division fell back in confusion. The third, and strongest, division led by the King advanced, and the two withdrawing divisions coalesced and resumed their advance against the English. Believing that the retreat of the first two French divisions marked the withdrawal of the French, Edward had ordered a force under [[Jean III de Grailly, captal de Buch|Captal de Buch]] to pursue. Sir John Chandos urged the Prince to launch this force upon the main body of the French army under the King. Seizing upon this idea, Edward ordered all his men-at-arms and knights to mount for the charge, while de Buch's men, already mounted, were instructed to advance around the French left flank and rear.<ref>This section reflects the traditional narrative of the battle, which relies to a substantial extent on the chronicle of Jean Froissart. For an alternative narrative based on the assumption that Froissart's narrative is not reliable, see Clifford J. Rogers, [https://www.academia.edu/34425406/The_Battle_of_Poitiers_1356_English_Version_ \"The Battle of Poitiers, 1356\"] (English-language version of  \"La batalla de Poitiers (1356)\", ''Desperta  Ferro.

With the French stunned by the attack, the impetus carried the English and Gascon forces right into their line. Simultaneously, de Buch's mobile reserve of mounted troops fell upon the French left flank and rear. With the French army fearful of encirclement, their cohesion disintegrated as many soldiers attempted to flee the field. Low on arrows, the English and Welsh archers abandoned their bows and ran forward to join the mel\u00e9e. Around this time, King John and his son, [[Philip the Bold]], found themselves surrounded. As written by Froissart, an exiled French knight fighting with the English, Sir Denis Morbeke of Artois approached the king, requesting the King's surrender. The King is said to have replied, \"To whom shall I yield me? Where is my cousin the Prince of Wales? If I might see him, I would speak with him\". Denis replied; \"Sir, he is not here; but yield you to me and I shall bring you to him\". The king handed him his right gauntlet, saying; \"I yield me to you\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Froissart |first=Jean |authorlink=Jean Froissart |editor-first=Charles |editor-last=Eliot |title=Chronicle and Romance: Froissart, Malory, Holinshed |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.126239 |accessdate=2018-09-17| year=1910 |page=[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.126239/page/n56 52] |chapter=The Battle of Poitiers |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the surrender of the King and his son Philip, the French army broke up and left the field, ending the battle.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\nFollowing the battle, Edward resumed his march back to the English stronghold at Bordeaux. [[Jean de Venette]], a Carmelite friar, vividly describes the chaos that ensued following the battle. The demise of the French nobility at the battle, only ten years from the catastrophe at [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy|Cr\u00e9cy]], threw the kingdom into chaos. The realm was left in the hands of the [[Charles V of France|Dauphin Charles]], who faced [[Jacquerie|popular rebellion across the kingdom]] in the wake of the defeat. Jean writes that the French nobles brutally repressed the rebellions, robbing, despoiling, and pillaging the peasants' goods. [[Free company|Mercenary companies]] hired by both sides added to the destruction, plundering the peasants and the churches.<ref>Jean Birdsall, Richard A. Newhall, ''The Chronicles of Jean de Venette '' (Columbia University Press 1953) p. 6</ref>\n\nCharles, to the misery of the French peasantry, began to raise additional funds to pay for the [[ransom]] of his father, and to continue the war effort. Capitalising on the discontent in France, [[Edward III of England|King Edward]] assembled his army at [[Calais]] in 1359 and led his army on a campaign against [[Rheims]]. Unable to take Rheims or the French capital, [[Paris]], Edward moved his army to [[Chartres]]. Later, the Dauphin Charles offered to open negotiations, and Edward agreed.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nThe [[Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny]] was ratified on 24 October 1360, ending the Edwardian phase of the [[Hundred Years' War]]. In it, Edward agreed to renounce his claims to the French throne, in exchange for full sovereign rights over an expanded Aquitaine and Calais, essentially restoring the former [[Angevin Empire]].<ref>Hersch Lauterpacht, \"Volume 20 of International Law Reports, Cambridge University Press, 1957, {{ISBN|0-521-46365-3}}, p. 118</ref>\n\n== Nobles and men-at-arms present ==\n=== English ===\n[[Jean Froissart|Froissart]] states that these men fought with the Black Prince:\n* [[Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick]]\n* [[William de Ufford, 2nd Earl of Suffolk]]\n* [[William de Montacute, 2nd Earl of Salisbury]]\n* [[John de Vere, 7th Earl of Oxford]]<ref>Edward Maunde Thompson, ''Chronicle of Geoffrey le Baker'', (Oxford at the Clarendon Press 1889) p. 248</ref>\n* [[Reginald de Cobham, 1st Baron Cobham]]\n* [[Edward le Despencer, 1st Baron le Despencer]]<ref>David Nicolle, Graham Turner, ''Poitiers 1356: The Capture of a King'' (U.K. Osprey Publishing, 2004), p. 10</ref>\n* [[James Audley|Lord James Audley]]\n* Lord Peter Audley\n* [[Thomas de Berkeley, 3rd Baron Berkeley|Thomas, Lord Berkeley]]\n* [[Ralph Basset, 4th Baron Basset of Drayton|Ralph, Lord Basset]]\n* [[Fulke FitzWarine, 3rd Baron FitzWarine|Fulk, Lord FitzWarin]]\n* Lord Delaware\n* Lord Manne\n* [[John de Willoughby, 3rd Baron Willoughby de Eresby|John, Lord Willoughby]]\n* Lord Bartholomew de Burghersh\n* [[Thomas Felton (died 1381)|Thomas, Lord of Felton]]<ref>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Felton, * Thomas (d.1381)|volume=18|page=308}}</ref>\n* Lord Richard of Pembroke\n* Lord Stephen of Cosington\n* Lord Bradetane\n* Lord of Pommiers\n* Lord of [[Langoiran|Languiran]]\n* [[Jean III de Grailly, captal de Buch|Captal of Buch]]\n* Lord John the 69th of Caumont\n* Lord de [[Lesparre-M\u00e9doc|Lesparre]]\n* Lord of [[Rauzan]]\n* Lord of Condon\n* Lord of [[Montferrand (district of Clermont-Ferrand)|Montferrand]]\n* Lord of [[Landiras]]\n* Lord Soudic of Latrau\n* Lord Eustace d'Aubrecicourt\n* Lord John of Ghistelles\n* Lord Daniel Pasele\n* Lord Denis of Amposta<ref>John Bourchier; G.

It was fought on 19 September 1356 in Nouaill\u00e9, near the city of [[Poitiers]] in [[Aquitaine]], western France. [[Edward, the Black Prince]], led an army of [[Kingdom of England|English]], [[Principality of Wales|Welsh]], [[Duchy of Brittany|Breton]] and [[Duchy of Gascony|Gascon]] troops, many of them veterans of the [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]]. They were attacked by a larger French force led by [[King John II of France]], which included allied [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scottish]] forces. The French were heavily defeated; an English counter-attack captured King John, along with [[Philip the Bold|his youngest son]], and much of the French nobility who were present.{{sfn|Blockmans|Prevenier|1999|pp=14\u201315}}\n\nThe effect of the defeat on France was catastrophic, leaving [[Charles V of France|Dauphin Charles]] to rule the country. Charles faced [[Jacquerie|populist revolts across the kingdom]] in the wake of the battle, which had destroyed the prestige of the French upper-class. The Edwardian phase of the war ended four years later in 1360, [[Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny|on favourable terms for England]].\n\nPoitiers was the second major English victory of the [[Hundred Years' War]], coming a decade after the [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]] and about half a century before the [[Battle of Agincourt]]. The town and battle were often referred to as ''Poictiers'' in contemporaneous recordings, a name commemorated by [[HMS Poictiers|several warships of the Royal Navy]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Kendall B.

Edward had been reluctant to pay homage to Philip in his role as [[Duke of Aquitaine]], resulting in Philip's confiscation of those lands in 1337, an act which provoked war between the two nations. Three years later, Edward declared himself [[King of France]]. The war had begun well for the English. They had achieved naval domination early in the conflict at the [[Battle of Sluys]] in 1340,<ref>Henri de Wailly.

Philip himself died in 1350, and was succeeded by his son, who was crowned King John II. In 1355, Edward III laid out plans for a second major campaign. His eldest son, [[Edward, the Black Prince]], now an experienced soldier following the Cr\u00e9cy campaign, landed at [[Bordeaux]] in Aquitaine, leading his army on a march through southern France to [[Carcassonne]]. Unable to take the heavily fortified settlement, Edward withdrew back to Bordeaux. In early 1356, the [[Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster|Duke of Lancaster]] led an army through [[Normandy]], while Edward led his army on a great [[chevauch\u00e9e]] from Bordeaux on 8 August 1356.<ref>William W. Lace, ''The Hundred Years' War'' {{ISBN|978-1-56006-233-2}}, 1/1994</ref>\n\nEdward's forces met little resistance, sacking numerous settlements, until they reached the [[Loire]] river at [[Tours]]. They were unable to take the castle or burn the town due to a heavy rainstorm. This delay allowed King John to attempt to pin down and destroy Edward's army. John, who had been besieging [[Breteuil, Eure|Breteuil]] in [[Normandy]], organised the bulk of his army at [[Chartres]] to the north of Tours. In order to increase the speed of his army's march, he dismissed between 15,000 and 20,000 of his lower quality infantry, just as Edward turned back to Bordeaux.<ref>Jonathan Sumption, ''The Hundred Years' War: Vol. 2: Trial by Fire'' (London: Faber, 2001), pp. 223, 227\u2013228</ref> The French rode hard and cut in front of the English army, crossing the bridge over the Vienne at Chauvigny. Learning of this, the Black Prince quickly moved his army south.

He deployed his front line of longbowmen behind a particularly prominent thick hedge, through which the road ran at right angles. The Earl of Douglas, commanding the Scottish division in the French army, advised King John that the attack should be delivered on foot, with horses being particularly vulnerable to English arrows. John heeded this advice, his army leaving its baggage behind and forming up on foot in front of the English. The English gained vantage points on the natural high ground in order for their longbowmen to have an advantage over the heavily armoured French troops.{{citation needed|date = September 2018}}\n\n==== English army ====\nThe English army was led by [[Edward, the Black Prince]], and composed primarily of English and Welsh troops, though there was a large contingent of [[Duchy of Gascony|Gascon]] and [[Duchy of Brittany|Breton]] soldiers with the army. Edward's army consisted of approximately 2,000 [[longbow]]men, 3,000 [[men-at-arms]], and a force of 1,000 Gascon infantry.\n\nLike the earlier engagement at [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy|Cr\u00e9cy]], the power of the English army lay in the [[longbow]], a tall, thick self-bow made of yew. Longbows had demonstrated their effectiveness against massed infantry and cavalry in several battles, such as [[Battle of Falkirk|Falkirk]] in 1298, [[Battle of Halidon Hill|Halidon Hill]] in 1333, and [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy|Cr\u00e9cy]] in 1346. Poitiers was the second of three major English victories of the [[Hundred Years' War]] attributed to the longbow, though its effectiveness against armoured French knights and men-at-arms has been disputed.<ref>{{cite book|last1 = Strickland|first1= Matthew|last2= Hardy|first2= Robert|date= 2005|pages= 272\u2013278|title = The Great Warbow: From Hastings to the Mary Rose|publisher = Sutton Publishing|isbn = 9780750931670}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|ref=harv |last=Kaiser |first=Robert E. |date=December 2003 |title=Medieval Military Surgery |journal=Medieval History Magazine|volume=1 |issue=4 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rogers |first1=Clifford J.|title=The Efficacy of the Medieval Longbow: A Reply to Kelly DeVries|journal=War in History|date=1998|volume=5|issue=2 |pages= 233\u201342 |url=https://www.academia.edu/13146838/_The_Efficacy_of_the_Medieval_Longbow_A_Reply_to_Kelly_DeVries_War_in_History_5_no._2_1998_233-42}}</ref>\n\n[[Geoffrey the Baker]] wrote that the English archers under the Earl of Salisbury \"made their arrows prevail over the [French] knights' armour\",<ref>Edward Maunde Thompson, ''Chronicle of Geoffrey le Baker'', (Oxford at the Clarendon Press 1889) p. 147 (\"''coegerunt sagittas armis militaribus prevalere''\") (</ref> but the bowmen on the other flank, under Warwick, were initially ineffective against the mounted French men-at-arms who enjoyed the double protection of steel plate armour and large leather shields.<ref>{{cite book|last=Barber|first=Richard|title=The Life and Campaigns of the Black Prince|year=1986|publisher=Boydell Press|location=Woodbridge|isbn=0-85115-435-2|page=76}}</ref> Once Warwick's archers redeployed to a position where they could hit the unarmored sides and backs of the horses, however, they quickly routed the cavalry force opposing them.

The English army's divisions were led by [[Edward, the Black Prince]], the [[Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]], the [[William de Montagu, 2nd Earl of Salisbury|Earl of Salisbury]], Sir John Chandos and [[Jean III de Grailly, captal de Buch|Captal de Buch]].\n\n==== French army ====\nThe French army was led by King John, and was composed largely of native French soldiers, though there was a contingent of [[Holy Roman Empire|German knights]], and a large force of [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scottish]] soldiers. The latter force was led by the [[William Douglas, 1st Earl of Douglas|Earl of Douglas]] and fought in the King's own division.<ref>William F. Skene, ''John of Fordun\u2019s Chronicle of the Scottish Nation'', (Edinburgh Edmonston and Douglas 1872), p. 365</ref> The French army at the battle comprised approximately 8,000 men-at-arms and 3,000 common infantry, though John had made the decision to leave behind the vast majority of his infantry, numbering up to 20,000, in order to overtake and force the English to battle.\n\nThe French army was arrayed in three \"battles\" or divisions. The vanguard was led by the [[Charles V of France|Dauphin Charles]], the second by the [[Philip, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], while the third, the largest, was led by the King himself.\n\n=== Negotiations ===\nPrior to the battle, the local prelate, [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[H\u00e9lie de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord (cardinal)|H\u00e9lie de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord]] attempted to broker a truce between the two sides, as recorded in the writings of the English commander, Sir John Chandos.<ref>Mildred K. Pope; Eleanor C. Lodge, ''Life of the Black Prince by the Herald of Sir John Chandos'' (Oxford, UK Clarendon Press 1910), p. 857</ref> Attending the conference on the French side were King John, the [[Earl of Tankerville|Count of Tankerville]], the Archbishop of Sens, and [[Jean II de Talaru|Jean de Talaru]]. Representing the English were the [[Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]], the [[Robert d'Ufford, 1st Earl of Suffolk|Earl of Suffolk]], [[Bartholomew de Burghersh, 2nd Baron Burghersh|Bartholomew de Burghersh]], [[James Audley]], and Sir John Chandos. The English offered to hand over all of the war booty they had taken on their raids throughout France, as well as a seven-year truce. John, who believed his force could easily overwhelm the English, declined their proposal. John's counter suggestion that the Black Prince and his army should surrender was flatly rejected.\n\n=== Fighting begins ===\n[[File:Battle of Poitiers 1356 map-en.svg|300px|thumb|Map of the battle]]\n\nAt the start of the battle, the English removed their [[Wagon train|baggage train]] from the field, prompting a hasty French assault, believing that what they saw was the English retreating.<ref name=\"MM99\">{{cite book|ref=harv |last=Urban |first=William L. |year=2006|title=Medieval Mercenaries: The Business of War|publisher=Greenhill Books |location=London|page=99}}</ref> The fighting began with a charge by a [[forlorn hope]] of 300 [[Holy Roman Empire|German]] knights, led by [[Jean de Clermont]]. The attack was a disaster, with many of the knights shot down or killed by English soldiery. According to [[Froissart's Chronicles|Froissart]], the English archers then shot their bows at the massed French infantry.<ref>https://www.britishbattles.com/one-hundred-years-war/battle-of-poitiers/</ref> The Dauphin's division reached the English line. Exhausted by a long march in heavy equipment and harassed by the hail of arrows, the division was repulsed after approximately two hours of combat.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://home.eckerd.edu/~oberhot/poitiers.htm |title=Battle of Poitiers |first=Tom |last=Oberhofer |publisher=[[Eckerd College]] |access-date=2018-09-17 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe retreating vanguard collided with the advancing division of the [[Philip, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], throwing the French army into chaos. Seeing the Dauphin's troops falling back, Orl\u00e9ans' division fell back in confusion. The third, and strongest, division led by the King advanced, and the two withdrawing divisions coalesced and resumed their advance against the English. Believing that the retreat of the first two French divisions marked the withdrawal of the French, Edward had ordered a force under [[Jean III de Grailly, captal de Buch|Captal de Buch]] to pursue. Sir John Chandos urged the Prince to launch this force upon the main body of the French army under the King. Seizing upon this idea, Edward ordered all his men-at-arms and knights to mount for the charge, while de Buch's men, already mounted, were instructed to advance around the French left flank and rear.<ref>This section reflects the traditional narrative of the battle, which relies to a substantial extent on the chronicle of Jean Froissart.

With the French stunned by the attack, the impetus carried the English and Gascon forces right into their line. Simultaneously, de Buch's mobile reserve of mounted troops fell upon the French left flank and rear. With the French army fearful of encirclement, their cohesion disintegrated as many soldiers attempted to flee the field. Low on arrows, the English and Welsh archers abandoned their bows and ran forward to join the mel\u00e9e. Around this time, King John and his son, [[Philip the Bold]], found themselves surrounded. As written by Froissart, an exiled French knight fighting with the English, Sir Denis Morbeke of Artois approached the king, requesting the King's surrender. The King is said to have replied, \"To whom shall I yield me? Where is my cousin the Prince of Wales? If I might see him, I would speak with him\". Denis replied; \"Sir, he is not here; but yield you to me and I shall bring you to him\".

[[Jean de Venette]], a Carmelite friar, vividly describes the chaos that ensued following the battle. The demise of the French nobility at the battle, only ten years from the catastrophe at [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy|Cr\u00e9cy]], threw the kingdom into chaos. The realm was left in the hands of the [[Charles V of France|Dauphin Charles]], who faced [[Jacquerie|popular rebellion across the kingdom]] in the wake of the defeat. Jean writes that the French nobles brutally repressed the rebellions, robbing, despoiling, and pillaging the peasants' goods. [[Free company|Mercenary companies]] hired by both sides added to the destruction, plundering the peasants and the churches.<ref>Jean Birdsall, Richard A. Newhall, ''The Chronicles of Jean de Venette '' (Columbia University Press 1953) p. 6</ref>\n\nCharles, to the misery of the French peasantry, began to raise additional funds to pay for the [[ransom]] of his father, and to continue the war effort. Capitalising on the discontent in France, [[Edward III of England|King Edward]] assembled his army at [[Calais]] in 1359 and led his army on a campaign against [[Rheims]]. Unable to take Rheims or the French capital, [[Paris]], Edward moved his army to [[Chartres]]. Later, the Dauphin Charles offered to open negotiations, and Edward agreed.{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\nThe [[Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny]] was ratified on 24 October 1360, ending the Edwardian phase of the [[Hundred Years' War]]. In it, Edward agreed to renounce his claims to the French throne, in exchange for full sovereign rights over an expanded Aquitaine and Calais, essentially restoring the former [[Angevin Empire]].<ref>Hersch Lauterpacht, \"Volume 20 of International Law Reports, Cambridge University Press, 1957, {{ISBN|0-521-46365-3}}, p. 118</ref>\n\n== Nobles and men-at-arms present ==\n=== English ===\n[[Jean Froissart|Froissart]] states that these men fought with the Black Prince:\n* [[Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick]]\n* [[William de Ufford, 2nd Earl of Suffolk]]\n* [[William de Montacute, 2nd Earl of Salisbury]]\n* [[John de Vere, 7th Earl of Oxford]]<ref>Edward Maunde Thompson, ''Chronicle of Geoffrey le Baker'', (Oxford at the Clarendon Press 1889) p. 248</ref>\n* [[Reginald de Cobham, 1st Baron Cobham]]\n* [[Edward le Despencer, 1st Baron le Despencer]]<ref>David Nicolle, Graham Turner, ''Poitiers 1356: The Capture of a King'' (U.K. Osprey Publishing, 2004), p. 10</ref>\n* [[James Audley|Lord James Audley]]\n* Lord Peter Audley\n* [[Thomas de Berkeley, 3rd Baron Berkeley|Thomas, Lord Berkeley]]\n* [[Ralph Basset, 4th Baron Basset of Drayton|Ralph, Lord Basset]]\n* [[Fulke FitzWarine, 3rd Baron FitzWarine|Fulk, Lord FitzWarin]]\n* Lord Delaware\n* Lord Manne\n* [[John de Willoughby, 3rd Baron Willoughby de Eresby|John, Lord Willoughby]]\n* Lord Bartholomew de Burghersh\n* [[Thomas Felton (died 1381)|Thomas, Lord of Felton]]<ref>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Felton, * Thomas (d.1381)|volume=18|page=308}}</ref>\n* Lord Richard of Pembroke\n* Lord Stephen of Cosington\n* Lord Bradetane\n* Lord of Pommiers\n* Lord of [[Langoiran|Languiran]]\n* [[Jean III de Grailly, captal de Buch|Captal of Buch]]\n* Lord John the 69th of Caumont\n* Lord de [[Lesparre-M\u00e9doc|Lesparre]]\n* Lord of [[Rauzan]]\n* Lord of Condon\n* Lord of [[Montferrand (district of Clermont-Ferrand)|Montferrand]]\n* Lord of [[Landiras]]\n* Lord Soudic of Latrau\n* Lord Eustace d'Aubrecicourt\n* Lord John of Ghistelles\n* Lord Daniel Pasele\n* Lord Denis of Amposta<ref>John Bourchier; G.
