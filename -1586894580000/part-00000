''{{lang|fo|Oyar}}'' represents the plural of ''{{lang|fo|oy}}'', older Faroese for \"island\". Due to sound changes, the modern Faroese word for island is ''oyggj''. The first element, ''{{lang|fo|f\u00f8r}}'', may reflect an Old Norse word ''{{lang|non|f\u00e6r}}'' (sheep), although this analysis is sometimes disputed because Faroese now uses the word ''{{lang|fo|sey\u00f0ur}}'' (from Old Norse ''{{lang|non|sau\u00f0r}}'') to mean \"sheep\". Another possibility is that the Irish monks, who settled the island around 625, had already given the islands a name related to the Gaelic word ''{{lang|ga|fearrann}}'', meaning \"land\" or \"estate\". This name could then have been passed on to the Norwegian settlers, who then added ''{{lang|fo|oyar}}'' (islands).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ordnet.dk/ddo/ordbog?query=f%C3%A6r%C3%B8ske|title=f\u00e6r\u00f8ske \u2014 Den Danske Ordbog|website=ordnet.dk}}</ref> The name thus translates as either \"Islands of Sheep\" or \"Islands of Fearrann\".\n\nIn [[Danish language|Danish]], the name ''{{lang|da|F\u00e6r\u00f8erne}}'' contains the same elements, though ''{{lang|da|\u00f8erne}}'' is the definite plural of ''{{lang|da|\u00f8}}'' (island).\n\nIn English, it may be seen as redundant to say ''the Faroe Islands'', since the ''oe'' comes from an element meaning \"island\". This is seen in the [[BBC]] [[Shipping Forecast]], where the waters around the islands are called ''Faeroes''. The name is also sometimes spelled \"Faeroe\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Faroe Islands|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/faroe+islands|website=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|accessdate=20 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Faeroe Islands|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Faeroe%20Islands|website=[[Dictionary.com]]|accessdate=20 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of the Faroe Islands}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2014}}\n\nArchaeological evidence shows settlers living on the Faroe Islands in two successive periods before the Norse arrived, the first between 300 and 600 AD and the second between 600 and 800 AD.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Church | first1 = M.

Sigmundur introduced Christianity, forcing Tr\u00f3ndur \u00ed G\u00f8tu to convert or face beheading and, although Sigmundur was subsequently murdered, Norwegian taxation was upheld. Norwegian control of the Faroes continued until 1814, although, when the [[Kingdom of Norway (872\u20131397)]] entered the [[Kalmar Union]] with Denmark, it gradually resulted in Danish control of the islands. The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] with [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Lutheranism|Evangelical Lutheranism]] and [[Reformed]] reached the Faroes in 1538. When the union between Denmark and Norway dissolved as a result of the [[Treaty of Kiel]] in 1814, Denmark retained possession of the Faroe Islands; Norway itself was joined in a union with Sweden.\n\nFollowing the turmoil caused by the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1803-1815) in 1816, the Faroe Islands became a county in the [[Kingdom of Denmark|Danish Kingdom]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cidob.org/en/publications/publication_series/monographs/monographs/secession_and_counter_secession_an_international_relations_perspective|title=CIDOB - Secession and Counter-secession.

The trade monopoly in the Faroe Islands was abolished in 1856, after which the area developed as a modern fishing nation with its own [[fishing fleet]].

The overall character of the climate of the islands is influenced by the strong warming influence of the Atlantic Ocean, which produces the [[North Atlantic Current]]. This, together with the remoteness of any source of landmass-induced warm or cold airflows, ensures that winters are mild (mean temperature 3.0 to 4.0&nbsp;\u00b0C or 37 to 39&nbsp;\u00b0F) while summers are cool (mean temperature 9.5 to 10.5&nbsp;\u00b0C or 49 to 51&nbsp;\u00b0F).\n\nThe islands are windy, cloudy, and cool throughout the year with an average of 210 rainy or snowy days per year. The islands lie in the path of depressions moving northeast, making strong winds and heavy rain possible at all times of the year. Sunny days are rare and overcast days are common. [[Hurricane Faith]] struck the Faroe Islands on 5 September 1966 with sustained winds over 100&nbsp;mph (160&nbsp;km/h) and only then did the storm cease to be a tropical system.<ref>GHCN Climate data, Thorshavn series 1881 to 2007</ref>\n\n[[File:Faroe Islands, Eysturoy, Funningsfj\u00f8r\u00f0ur (fjord) in October.jpg|left|thumb|An October evening on [[Eysturoy]]]]\nThe climate varies greatly over small distances, due to the altitude, ocean currents, topography, and winds. Precipitation varies considerably throughout the archipelago. In some highland areas, snow cover may last for months with snowfalls possible for the greater part of the year (on the highest peaks, summer snowfall is by no means rare), while in some sheltered coastal locations, several years pass without any snowfall whatsoever. T\u00f3rshavn receives frosts more often than other areas just a short distance to the south. Snow also is seen at a much higher frequency than on outlying islands nearby.

Until 2007, there were seven electoral districts, each comprising a ''s\u00fdsla'', while Streymoy was divided into a northern and southern part ([[T\u00f3rshavn]] region). However, on 25 October 2007, changes were made such that the entire country is one electoral district, giving each vote equal weight.\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n{{main|Regions of the Faroe Islands|Municipalities of the Faroe Islands}}\n[[File:Map of the Faroe Islands en.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Relief map of the Faroe Islands]]\n\nAdministratively, the islands are divided into 29 [[Municipalities of the Faroe Islands|municipalities]] (''kommunur'') within which there are 120 or so [[list of towns in the Faroe Islands|settlements]].\n\nTraditionally, there are also the [[Regions of the Faroe Islands|six ''s\u00fdslur'']] (similar to the British \"shire\": [[Nor\u00f0oyar]], [[Eysturoy]], [[Streymoy]], [[V\u00e1gar]], [[Sandoy]], and [[Su\u00f0uroy]]). Although today ''[[s\u00fdsla]]'' technically means \"police district\", the term is still commonly used to indicate a geographical region. In earlier times, each ''s\u00fdsla'' had its own [[Thing (assembly)|assembly]], the so-called ''v\u00e1rting'' (\"spring assembly\").\n\n=== Relationship with Denmark ===\n{{Multiple issues|{{POV section|date=March 2020}}{{More citations needed section|date=March 2020}}|section=yes}}\nThe Faroe Islands have been under Norwegian-Danish control since 1388. The 1814 [[Treaty of Kiel]] terminated the [[Denmark\u2013Norway|Danish\u2013Norwegian]] union, and Norway came under the rule of the [[King of Sweden]], while the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and [[Greenland]] remained Danish possessions. From ancient times the Faroe Islands had a parliament (''L\u00f8gting''), which was abolished in 1816, and the Faroe Islands were to be governed as an ordinary [[Counties of Denmark|Danish amt]] (county), with the [[Prefect|Amtmand]] as its head of government. In 1851, the ''L\u00f8gting'' was reinstated, but, until 1948, served mainly as an advisory body.\n\nThe islands are home to a notable [[Faroese independence|independence movement]] that has seen an increase in popularity within recent decades. At the end of [[World War II]], some of the population favoured independence from Denmark, and on 14 September 1946, [[1946 Faroese independence referendum|an independence referendum]] was held on the question of [[secession]]. It was a consultative referendum; the parliament was not bound to follow the people's vote. This was the first time that the Faroese people had been asked whether they favoured independence or wanted to continue within the [[Danish kingdom]].\n\n[[File:Queen Margrethe 21-06-2005 V\u00e1gur.jpg|thumb|left|Queen [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Margrethe II]], monarch of the [[Unity of the Realm]], during a visit to [[V\u00e1gur]] in 2005]]\nThe result of the vote was a majority in favour of secession. The Speaker of the L\u00f8gting, together with the majority, started the process of becoming a sovereign nation. The minority of the L\u00f8gting left in protest, because they thought these actions were illegal. One parliament member, J\u00e1kup \u00ed J\u00e1kupsstovu, was shunned from his own party, the Social Democratic Party, because he joined the majority of the L\u00f8gting.\n\nThe Speaker of the L\u00f8gting declared the Faroe Islands independent on 18 September 1946.\n\nOn 25 September 1946, a Danish prefect announced to the L\u00f8gting, that the king had dissolved the parliament and wanted new elections, therefore not honoring the wish of the majority.\n\nA parliamentary election was held a few months later, in which the political parties that favoured staying in the Danish kingdom increased their share of the vote and formed a coalition. Based on this, they chose to reject secession. Instead, a compromise was made and the [[Folketing]] passed a home-rule law that went into effect in 1948. The Faroe Islands' status as a Danish ''amt'' was thereby brought to an end; the Faroe Islands were given a high degree of self-governance, supported by a financial [[subsidy]] from Denmark to recompense expenses the islands have on Danish services.\n\nIn protest to the new Home Rule Act, the Republic Party (Tj\u00f3\u00f0veldi), was founded.\n\nAt present, the islanders are about evenly split between those favouring independence and those who prefer to continue as a part of the Kingdom of Denmark. Within both camps there is a wide range of opinions. Of those who favour independence, some are in favour of an immediate [[unilateral declaration of independence]]. Others see it as something to be attained gradually and with the full consent of the Danish government and the [[Danish nation]]. In the unionist camp there are also many who foresee and welcome a gradual increase in autonomy even while strong ties with Denmark are maintained.\n\n{{As of|2011}}, a new draft Faroese constitution is being drawn up. However the draft has been declared by the former [[Danish Prime Minister]], [[Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen]], as incompatible with Denmark's constitution and if the Faroese political parties wish to continue with it, then they must declare independence.<ref>[http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2011/07/06/denmark-and-faroe-islands-in-constitutional-clash/ Denmark and Faroe Islands in constitutional clash], IceNews 6 July 2011</ref>\n\n=== Relationship with the European Union ===\n{{main|Faroe Islands and the European Union}}\nAs explicitly asserted by both [[treaties of the European Union]], the Faroe Islands are not part of the [[European Union]]. The Faroes are not grouped with the EU when it comes to international trade; for instance, when the EU and Russia imposed reciprocal trade sanctions on each other over the [[War in Donbass]] in 2014, the Faroes began exporting significant amounts of fresh [[salmon]] to Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/faeroe-islands-boom-by-selling-salmon-to-russia-1424483776|title=Faeroe Islands Boom by Selling Salmon to Russia|first=Anton|last=Troianovski|date=21 February 2015|publisher=|via=Wall Street Journal}}</ref> Moreover, a [[special member state territories and the European Union#Faroe Islands|protocol]] to the treaty of accession of Denmark to the European Communities stipulates that Danish nationals residing in the Faroe Islands are not considered Danish nationals within the meaning of the treaties. Hence, Danish people living in the Faroes are not [[citizenship of the European Union|citizens of the European Union]] (though other EU nationals living there remain EU citizens). The Faroes are not covered by the [[Schengen Agreement]], but there are no border checks when travelling between the Faroes and any Schengen country (the Faroes have been part of the [[Nordic Passport Union]] since 1966, and since 2001 there have been no permanent border checks between the Nordic countries and the rest of the [[Schengen Area]] as part of the Schengen agreement).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tinganes.fo/logir/Rikislogartilmaeli/2001Schengen.htm |title=Implementation of Schengen convention by the prime minister as approved by the L\u00f8gting |publisher=Tinganes.fo |date= |accessdate=25 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721114619/http://www.tinganes.fo/logir/Rikislogartilmaeli/2001Schengen.htm |archive-date=21 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Relationship with international organisations ===\nThe Faroe Islands are not a fully independent country, but they do have political relations directly with other countries through agreement with Denmark.

Later, when the Vikings colonised the islands, there was a considerable increase in the population. However, it never exceeded 5,000 until the 19th century. Around 1349, about half the population perished in the [[Black Death]] plague.\n\nOnly with the rise of the deep-sea fishery (and thus independence from agriculture in the islands' harsh terrain) and with general progress in the health service was rapid population growth possible in the Faroes. Beginning in the 19th century, the population increased tenfold in 200 years.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1990s, the Faroe Islands entered a deep economic crisis leading to heavy emigration; however, this trend reversed in subsequent years to a net immigration. This has been in the form of a population replacement as young Faroese women leave and are replaced with Asian/Pacific brides.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-24637771|title=Faroe Islands: Men 'must import brides'|work=BBC News|date=23 October 2013}}</ref>\nIn 2011, there were 2,155 more men than women between the age of 0 to 59 in the Faroe Islands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in.fo/news-detail/news/faid-kvinnurnar-heimaftur/|title=F\u00e1i\u00f0 kvinnurnar heimaftur|last=Rana|first=Danjal av|date=22 January 2015|publisher=Sosialurin \u2013 in.fo|language=Faroese|accessdate=4 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Faroese population is spread across most of the area; it was not until recent decades that significant urbanisation occurred. Industrialisation has been remarkably decentralised, and the area has therefore maintained quite a viable rural culture. Nevertheless, villages with poor harbour facilities have been the losers in the development from agriculture to fishing, and in the most peripheral agricultural areas, also known as [[\u00datoyggjar]] \"Outer Islands\", there are few young people. In recent decades, the village-based social structure has nevertheless been placed under pressure, giving way to a rise in interconnected \"centres\" that are better able to provide goods and services than the badly connected periphery. This means that shops and services are now relocating en masse from the villages into the centres, and slowly but steadily the Faroese population is concentrating in and around the centres.\n\nIn the 1990s, the government abandoned the old national policy of developing the villages (Bygdamenning), and instead began a process of regional development (\u00d8kismenning). The term \"region\" referred to the large islands of the Faroes. Nevertheless, the government was unable to press through the structural reform of merging small rural municipalities to create sustainable, decentralised entities that could drive forward regional development. As regional development has been difficult on the administrative level, the government has instead invested heavily in infrastructure, interconnecting the regions.\n\nIn general, it is becoming less valid to regard the Faroes as a society based on separate islands and regions. The huge investments in roads, bridges and sub-sea tunnels (see also [[Transport in the Faroe Islands]]) have bound the islands together, creating a coherent economic and cultural sphere that covers almost 90% of the population. From this perspective it is reasonable to regard the Faroes as a dispersed city or even to refer to it as the ''Faroese Network City''.{{citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\n[[File:Faroe stamp 048 europe (v u hammershaimb).jpg|thumb|upright|A stamp commemorating [[V.

Today, around 10% of the Faroese population are members of the Open Brethren community (''Br\u00f8\u00f0rasamkoman''). About 3% belong to the [[Charismatic Movement]]. There are several charismatic churches around the islands, the largest of which, called Keldan (The Spring), has about 200 to 300 members. About 2% belong to other Christian groups. The [[Adventism|Adventists]] operate a private school in T\u00f3rshavn. [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] also have four congregations with a total of 121 members. The Roman Catholic congregation has about 170 members and falls under the jurisdiction of Denmark's [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Copenhagen]].

The F\u00f3lkask\u00fali also provides optional preschool education as well as the tenth year of education that is a prerequisite to get admitted to upper secondary education. Students that complete compulsory education are allowed to continue education in a [[vocational school]], where they can have job-specific training and education. Since the fishing industry is an important part of [[Economy of the Faroe Islands|country's economy]], maritime schools are an important part of Faroese education. Upon completion of the tenth year of F\u00f3lkask\u00fali, students can continue to upper secondary education which consists of several different types of schools. Higher education is offered at the [[University of the Faroe Islands]]; a part of Faroese youth moves abroad to pursue higher education, mainly in [[Denmark]].

The Faroe Islands were long isolated from the main cultural phases and movements that swept across parts of Europe. This means that they have maintained a great part of their traditional culture. The language spoken is [[Faroese language|Faroese]], which is one of three insular [[North Germanic languages]] descended from the [[Old Norse]] language spoken in Scandinavia in the [[Viking Age]], the others being [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and the extinct [[Norn language|Norn]], which is thought to have been mutually intelligible with Faroese. Until the 15th century, Faroese had a similar orthography to Icelandic and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], but after the Reformation in 1538, the ruling [[Norway|Norwegians]] outlawed its use in schools, churches and official documents. Although a rich spoken tradition survived, for 300 years the language was not written down. This means that all poems and stories were handed down orally. These works were split into the following divisions: sagnir (historical), \u00e6vint\u00fdr (stories) and [[kv\u00e6\u00f0i]] (ballads), often set to music and the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] chain dance. These were eventually written down in the 19th century.\n\n===Faroese literature===\n{{main|Faroese literature}}\n[[File:Faroe stamp 364 rasmussen and skardi.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Regin \u00ed L\u00ed\u00f0|Rasmus Rasmussen]], the writer who wrote the first novel in the [[Faroese language]] (poetical name: Regin \u00ed L\u00ed\u00f0) and [[S\u00edmun av Skar\u00f0i]], the poet who wrote the Faroese national hymn]]\nFaroese written literature has only really developed in the past 100\u2013200 years. This is mainly because of the islands' isolation, and also because the [[Faroese language]] was not written down in a standardised format until 1890. The Danish language was also encouraged at the expense of Faroese. Nevertheless, the Faroes have produced several authors and poets. A rich centuries-old oral tradition of folk tales and Faroese folk songs accompanied the [[Faroese dance|Faroese chain dance]]. The people learned these songs and stories by heart, and told or sang them to each other, teaching the younger generations too. This kind of literature was gathered in the 19th century and early 20th century. The Faroese folk songs, in Faroese called ''kv\u00e6\u00f0i'', are still in use although not so large-scale as earlier. Some of the Faroese folk songs have been used by the Faroese Viking metal band [[T\u00fdr (band)|T\u00fdr]], i.e., ''[[Ormurin Langi]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Ormurin-Langi/dp/B0042GGCG4 |title=Ormurin Langi: T\u00fdr: MP3 Downloads |date=31 August 2010 |accessdate=14 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe first [[List of novels written in Faroese|Faroese novel]], ''B\u00e1belstorni\u00f0'' by [[Regin \u00ed L\u00ed\u00f0]], was published in 1909; the second novel was published 18 years later. In the period 1930 to 1940 a writer from the village Sk\u00e1lav\u00edk on Sandoy island, [[He\u00f0in Br\u00fa]], published three novels: ''Lognbr\u00e1'' (1930), ''Fastat\u00f8kur'' (1935) and ''Fe\u00f0gar \u00e1 fer\u00f0'' (English title: ''The old man and his sons'') (1940).

Jacobsen]] (1937\u20132012), a schoolteacher from [[Sandv\u00edk]], wrote short stories, plays, children's books and even novels. Most Faroese writers write in Faroese; two exceptions are [[William Heinesen]] (1900\u201391) and [[J\u00f8rgen-Frantz Jacobsen]] (1900\u201338).\n\nWomen were not so visible in the early Faroese literature except for [[Helena Patursson]] (1864\u20131916), but in the last decades of the 20th century and in the beginning of the 21st century female writers like [[Ebba Hentze]] (born 1933) wrote children's books, short stories, etc. [[Gu\u00f0ri\u00f0 Helmsdal]] published the first modernistic collecticoon of poems, ''L\u00fdtt lot'', in 1963, which at the same time was the first collection of Faroese poems written by a woman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ms.fo/?page_id=1099 |title=Gu\u00f0ri\u00f0 Helmsdal |publisher=Ms.fo |date= |accessdate=14 March 2014}}</ref> Her daughter, [[Rakel Helmsdal]] (born 1966), is also a writer, best known for her children's books, for which she has won several prizes and nominations.

Some of these writers have been nominated for the [[Nordic Council's Literature Prize]] two to six times, but have never won it.

[[B\u00e1r\u00f0ur Oskarsson]] (born 1972) is a children's book writer and illustrator; his books won prizes in the Faroes, Germany and the [[West Nordic Council's Children and Youth Literature Prize]] (2006). Though not born in the Faroe Islands, Matthew Landrum an American poet and editor for the Structo magazine, has written a collection of poems about the Islands.

Multiple Danish Music Award winner [[Teitur Lassen]] calls the Faroes home and is arguably the islands' most internationally well-known musical export.\n\nThe Islands have their own [[orchestra]] (the classical ensemble ''Aldub\u00e1ran'') and many different choirs; the best-known of these is ''Havnark\u00f3ri\u00f0''. The best-known local Faroese composers are [[Sunleif Rasmussen]] and [[Kristian Blak]], who is also head of the record company [[Tutl]]. The first Faroese opera was by Sunleif Rasmussen. It is entitled ''\u00cd \u00d3\u00f0amansgar\u00f0i'' (The Madman's Garden) and was premiered on 12 October 2006 at the Nordic House. The opera is based on a short story by the writer [[William Heinesen]].\n\nYoung Faroese musicians who have gained much popularity recently are [[Eiv\u00f8r P\u00e1lsd\u00f3ttir]], Anna Katrin Egilstr\u00f8\u00f0, Lena (Lena Andersen), [[H\u00f8gni Reistrup]], [[H\u00f8gni Lisberg]], HEI\u00d0RIK ([[Hei\u00f0rik \u00e1 Heygum]]), [[Gu\u00f0ri\u00f0 Hansd\u00f3ttir]] and [[Brandur Enni]].\n\nWell-known bands include [[T\u00fdr (band)|T\u00fdr]], Gestir, [[Hamfer\u00f0]], [[The Ghost (Faroese band)|The Ghost]], [[Boys in a Band]], ORKA, [[:fo:200 (rokkb\u00f3lkur)|200]], Grandma's Basement, [[Sic (band)|SIC]], and the former band Clickhaze.\n\nThe festival of contemporary and classical music, ''Summart\u00f3nar'', is held each summer. The [[G! Festival]] in [[Nor\u00f0rag\u00f8ta]] in July and [[Summarfestivalurin]] in [[Klaksv\u00edk]] in August are both large, open-air music festivals for popular music with both local and international musicians participating. Havnar Jazzfelag was established 21 November 1975, and is still active. Currently Havnar Jazzfelag is arranging VetrarJazz amongst other jazz-festivals in The Faroe Islands.\n\n===The Nordic House in the Faroe Islands===\nThe [[Nordic House in the Faroe Islands]] ({{lang-fo|Nor\u00f0urlandah\u00fasi\u00f0}}) is the most important cultural institution in the Faroes. Its aim is to support and promote [[Scandinavia]]n and Faroese culture, locally and in the Nordic region. [[Erlendur Patursson]] (1913\u201386), Faroese member of the [[Nordic Council]], raised the idea of a Nordic cultural house in the Faroe Islands. A Nordic competition for architects was held in 1977, in which 158 architects participated. Winners were Ola Steen from [[Norway]] and Kolbr\u00fan Ragnarsd\u00f3ttir from [[Iceland]]. By staying true to [[folklore]], the architects built the Nordic House to resemble an enchanted hill of [[elf|elves]]. The house opened in [[T\u00f3rshavn]] in 1983. The Nordic House is a cultural organization under the Nordic Council. The Nordic House is run by a steering committee of eight, of whom three are Faroese and five from other Nordic countries. There is also a local advisory body of fifteen members, representing Faroese cultural organizations. The House is managed by a director appointed by the steering committee for a four-year term.\n\n===Traditional food===\n{{main|Faroese cuisine}}\nTraditional Faroese food is mainly based on meat, seafood and potatoes and uses few fresh vegetables. Mutton of the [[Faroe sheep]] is the basis of many meals, and one of the most popular treats is ''[[skerpikj\u00f8t]]'', well aged, wind-dried mutton, which is quite chewy. The drying shed, known as a ''hjallur'', is a standard feature in many Faroese homes, particularly in the small towns and villages. Other traditional foods are ''r\u00e6st kj\u00f8t'' (semi-dried mutton) and ''r\u00e6stur fiskur'', matured fish. Another Faroese specialty is ''[[tv\u00f8st og spik]]'', made from [[pilot whale]] meat and [[blubber]]. (A parallel meat/fat dish made with [[offal]] is ''[[garnat\u00e1lg]]''.) The tradition of consuming meat and blubber from pilot whales arises from the fact that a single kill can provide many meals. Fresh fish also features strongly in the traditional local diet, as do [[seabird]]s, such as [[Faroese puffin]]s, and their eggs. Dried fish is also commonly eaten.\n[[File:Dog as truck driver.jpg|thumb|right|Truck delivering [[Cadbury]] chocolate in the Faroe Islands]]\nThere are two breweries in the Faroe Islands. The first brewery is called [[F\u00f6roya Bj\u00f3r]] and has produced beer since 1888 with exports mainly to Iceland and Denmark. The second brewery is called Okkara Bryggjar\u00ed and was founded in 2010. A local specialty is ''fredrikk'', a special brew made in [[N\u00f3lsoy]]. Production of hard alcohol such as [[snaps]] is forbidden in the Faroe Islands, hence the Faroese [[akvavit]] is produced abroad.\n\nSince the friendly British occupation, the Faroese have been fond of British food, in particular [[fish and chips]] and British-style chocolate such as [[Cadbury Dairy Milk]], which is found in many of the island's shops.<ref>{{cite news |title=Nordic holiday ideas |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/sep/02/scandinavia-holidays-sweden-lapland |work=The Guardian |date=2 September 2011|last = Dixon|first = Rachel}}</ref>\n\n===Whaling===\n{{main|Whaling in the Faroe Islands}}\n[[File:Whaling in the Faroe Islands in August 2012.JPG|thumb|Boats driving a pod of pilot whales into a bay of [[Su\u00f0uroy]] in 2012]]\nThere are records of drive hunts in the Faroe Islands dating from 1584.<ref>{{cite book |first=Philippa |last=Brakes |chapter=A background to whaling |year=2004 |editor=Philippa Brakes |editor2=Andrew Butterworth |editor3=Mark Simmonds |editor4=Philip Lymbery |title=Troubled Waters: A Review of the Welfare Implications of Modern Whaling Activities |isbn=0-9547065-0-1 |page=7 |chapter-url=http://www.wdcs.org/submissions_bin/troubledwaters.pdf}}</ref> [[Whaling in the Faroe Islands]] is regulated by Faroese authorities but not by the [[International Whaling Commission]] as there are disagreements about the Commission's legal authority to regulate [[cetacea]]n hunts. Hundreds of [[long-finned pilot whale]]s (''Globicephala melaena'') could be killed in a year, mainly during the summer. The hunts, called ''grindadr\u00e1p'' in Faroese, are non-commercial and are organized on a community level; anyone can participate. When a whale pod by chance is spotted near land the participating hunters first surround the pilot whales with a wide semicircle of boats and then slowly and quietly begin to drive the whales towards the chosen authorised bay.<ref name=\"Home\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whaling.fo/en/home/|title=Home|publisher=}}</ref> When a pod of whales has been stranded the killing is begun.\n\nFaroese animal welfare legislation, which also applies to whaling, requires that animals are killed as quickly and with as little suffering as possible. A regulation spinal lance is used to sever the [[spinal cord]], which also severs the major blood supply to the brain, ensuring both loss of consciousness and death within seconds. The spinal lance has been introduced as preferred standard equipment for killing pilot whales and has been shown to reduce killing time to 1\u20132 seconds.<ref name=\"Home\"/>\n\nThis \"grindadr\u00e1p\" is legal and provides food for many people in the Faroe Islands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whaling.fo/thepilot.htm#Drivingthewhales |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324072829/http://www.whaling.fo/thepilot.htm |title=Whales and whaling in the Faroe Islands |publisher=Faroese Government |accessdate=5 December 2006 |archivedate=24 March 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wdcs.org/dan/publishing.nsf/allweb/99E632F7502FCC3B802568F20048794C |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031231236/http://www.wdcs.org/dan/publishing.nsf/allweb/99E632F7502FCC3B802568F20048794C |title=Why do whales and dolphins strand? |publisher=[[WDCS]] |accessdate=5 December 2006 |archivedate=31 October 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Nicole|last=Chrismar|date=28 July 2006|title=Dolphins Hunted for Sport and Fertilizer|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=2248161&page=1|publisher=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=21 July 2009}}</ref> However, a study has found whale meat and blubber to currently be contaminated with [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and not recommended for human consumption, as too much may cause such adverse health effects as birth defects of the nervous system, high blood pressure, damaged immune system, increased risk for developing [[Parkinson's disease]], [[hypertension]], [[arteriosclerosis]], and [[Diabetes mellitus type 2]]:\n{{quote|Therefore we recommend that adults eat no more than one to two meals a month.

Garments include sweaters, scarves, and gloves. Faroese jumpers have distinct Nordic patterns; each village has some regional variations handed down from mother to daughter. There has recently been a strong revival of interest in Faroese knitting, with young people knitting and wearing updated versions of old patterns emphasized by strong colours and bold patterns. This appears to be a reaction to the loss of traditional lifestyles, and as a way to maintain and assert cultural tradition in a rapidly-changing society. Many young people study and move abroad, and this helps them maintain cultural links with their specific Faroese heritage.\n\nThere has also been a great interest in Faroese [[sweater]]s<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/10/sarah-lund-jumper-copyright-the-killing|title=Sarah Lund's jumper is exhibit A in a legal battle|first=Mark|last=Townsend|date=9 August 2014|work=The Guardian}}</ref> from the TV series ''[[The Killing (Danish TV series)|The Killing]]'', where the main actress (Detective Inspector Sarah Lund, played by [[Sofie Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l]]) wears Faroese sweaters.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/9533226/Fans-of-The-Killing-can-now-knit-their-own-Sarah-Lund-jumper.html|title=Fans of 'The Killing' can now knit their own Sarah Lund jumper|last=Hall|first=James|date=2012-09-10|access-date=2020-01-28|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>\n\n[[Lace knitting]] is a traditional handicraft. The most distinctive trait of [[Faroese lace shawls]] is the centre-back [[gusset]] shaping. Each shawl consists of two triangular side panels, a trapezoid-shaped back gusset, an edge treatment, and usually shoulder shaping. These are worn by all generations of women, particularly as part of the traditional Faroese costume as an overgarment.\n\n[[File:Faroese folk dance club from vagar.jpg|thumb|left|Faroese folk dancers, some of them in national costume]]\nThe traditional Faroese national dress is also a local handicraft that people spend a lot of time, money, and effort to assemble. It is worn at weddings and traditional dancing events, and on feast days. The cultural significance of the garment should not be underestimated, both as an expression of local and national identity and a passing on and reinforcing of traditional skills that bind local communities together.\n\nA young Faroese person is normally handed down a set of children's Faroese clothes that have passed from generation to generation. Children are [[confirmed]] at age 14, and normally start to collect the pieces to make an adult outfit, which is considered as a rite of passage. Traditionally the aim would have been to complete the outfit by the time a young person was ready to marry and wear the clothes at the ceremony\u2014though it is mainly only men who do this now.\n\nEach piece is intricately hand-knitted, dyed, woven or embroidered to the specifications of the wearer. For example, the man's waistcoat is put together by hand in bright blue, red or black fine wool. The front is then intricately embroidered with colourful silk threads, often by a female relative. The motifs are often local Faroese flowers or herbs. After this, a row of Faroese-made solid silver buttons are sewn on the outfit.\n\nWomen wear embroidered silk, cotton or wool shawls and pinafores that can take months to weave or embroider with local flora and fauna. They are also adorned with a handwoven black and red ankle-length skirt, knitted black and red jumper, a velvet belt, and black 18th century style shoes with silver buckles. The outfit is held together by a row of solid silver buttons, silver chains and locally-made silver brooches and belt buckles, often fashioned with Viking style motifs.\n\nBoth men's and women's national dress are extremely costly and can take many years to assemble. Women in the family often work together to assemble the outfits, including knitting the close-fitting jumpers, weaving and embroidering, sewing and assembling the national dress.\n\nThis tradition binds together families, passes on traditional crafts, and reinforces the Faroese culture of traditional village life in the context of a modern society.\n\n===Public holidays===\n[[File:F\u00f8roysk fl\u00f8gg \u00e1 \u00d3lavs\u00f8ku.jpg|thumb|The annual ''\u00d3lavs\u00f8ka'' parade on 28 July 2005.]]\n{{see also|Public holidays in Denmark}}\n''[[\u00d3lavs\u00f8ka]]'' is on 29 July; it commemorates the death of [[Saint Olaf]].

''{{lang|fo|Oyar}}'' represents the plural of ''{{lang|fo|oy}}'', older Faroese for \"island\". Due to sound changes, the modern Faroese word for island is ''oyggj''. The first element, ''{{lang|fo|f\u00f8r}}'', may reflect an Old Norse word ''{{lang|non|f\u00e6r}}'' (sheep), although this analysis is sometimes disputed because Faroese now uses the word ''{{lang|fo|sey\u00f0ur}}'' (from Old Norse ''{{lang|non|sau\u00f0r}}'') to mean \"sheep\". Another possibility is that the Irish monks, who settled the island around 625, had already given the islands a name related to the Gaelic word ''{{lang|ga|fearrann}}'', meaning \"land\" or \"estate\". This name could then have been passed on to the Norwegian settlers, who then added ''{{lang|fo|oyar}}'' (islands).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ordnet.dk/ddo/ordbog?query=f%C3%A6r%C3%B8ske|title=f\u00e6r\u00f8ske \u2014 Den Danske Ordbog|website=ordnet.dk}}</ref> The name thus translates as either \"Islands of Sheep\" or \"Islands of Fearrann\".\n\nIn [[Danish language|Danish]], the name ''{{lang|da|F\u00e6r\u00f8erne}}'' contains the same elements, though ''{{lang|da|\u00f8erne}}'' is the definite plural of ''{{lang|da|\u00f8}}'' (island).\n\nIn English, it may be seen as redundant to say ''the Faroe Islands'', since the ''oe'' comes from an element meaning \"island\". This is seen in the [[BBC]] [[Shipping Forecast]], where the waters around the islands are called ''Faeroes''.

Precipitation varies considerably throughout the archipelago. In some highland areas, snow cover may last for months with snowfalls possible for the greater part of the year (on the highest peaks, summer snowfall is by no means rare), while in some sheltered coastal locations, several years pass without any snowfall whatsoever. T\u00f3rshavn receives frosts more often than other areas just a short distance to the south. Snow also is seen at a much higher frequency than on outlying islands nearby.

Although today ''[[s\u00fdsla]]'' technically means \"police district\", the term is still commonly used to indicate a geographical region. In earlier times, each ''s\u00fdsla'' had its own [[Thing (assembly)|assembly]], the so-called ''v\u00e1rting'' (\"spring assembly\").\n\n=== Relationship with Denmark ===\n{{Multiple issues|{{POV section|date=March 2020}}{{More citations needed section|date=March 2020}}|section=yes}}\nThe Faroe Islands have been under Norwegian-Danish control since 1388. The 1814 [[Treaty of Kiel]] terminated the [[Denmark\u2013Norway|Danish\u2013Norwegian]] union, and Norway came under the rule of the [[King of Sweden]], while the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and [[Greenland]] remained Danish possessions. From ancient times the Faroe Islands had a parliament (''L\u00f8gting''), which was abolished in 1816, and the Faroe Islands were to be governed as an ordinary [[Counties of Denmark|Danish amt]] (county), with the [[Prefect|Amtmand]] as its head of government. In 1851, the ''L\u00f8gting'' was reinstated, but, until 1948, served mainly as an advisory body.\n\nThe islands are home to a notable [[Faroese independence|independence movement]] that has seen an increase in popularity within recent decades. At the end of [[World War II]], some of the population favoured independence from Denmark, and on 14 September 1946, [[1946 Faroese independence referendum|an independence referendum]] was held on the question of [[secession]]. It was a consultative referendum; the parliament was not bound to follow the people's vote. This was the first time that the Faroese people had been asked whether they favoured independence or wanted to continue within the [[Danish kingdom]].\n\n[[File:Queen Margrethe 21-06-2005 V\u00e1gur.jpg|thumb|left|Queen [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Margrethe II]], monarch of the [[Unity of the Realm]], during a visit to [[V\u00e1gur]] in 2005]]\nThe result of the vote was a majority in favour of secession. The Speaker of the L\u00f8gting, together with the majority, started the process of becoming a sovereign nation. The minority of the L\u00f8gting left in protest, because they thought these actions were illegal. One parliament member, J\u00e1kup \u00ed J\u00e1kupsstovu, was shunned from his own party, the Social Democratic Party, because he joined the majority of the L\u00f8gting.\n\nThe Speaker of the L\u00f8gting declared the Faroe Islands independent on 18 September 1946.\n\nOn 25 September 1946, a Danish prefect announced to the L\u00f8gting, that the king had dissolved the parliament and wanted new elections, therefore not honoring the wish of the majority.\n\nA parliamentary election was held a few months later, in which the political parties that favoured staying in the Danish kingdom increased their share of the vote and formed a coalition. Based on this, they chose to reject secession. Instead, a compromise was made and the [[Folketing]] passed a home-rule law that went into effect in 1948. The Faroe Islands' status as a Danish ''amt'' was thereby brought to an end; the Faroe Islands were given a high degree of self-governance, supported by a financial [[subsidy]] from Denmark to recompense expenses the islands have on Danish services.\n\nIn protest to the new Home Rule Act, the Republic Party (Tj\u00f3\u00f0veldi), was founded.\n\nAt present, the islanders are about evenly split between those favouring independence and those who prefer to continue as a part of the Kingdom of Denmark. Within both camps there is a wide range of opinions. Of those who favour independence, some are in favour of an immediate [[unilateral declaration of independence]]. Others see it as something to be attained gradually and with the full consent of the Danish government and the [[Danish nation]]. In the unionist camp there are also many who foresee and welcome a gradual increase in autonomy even while strong ties with Denmark are maintained.\n\n{{As of|2011}}, a new draft Faroese constitution is being drawn up. However the draft has been declared by the former [[Danish Prime Minister]], [[Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen]], as incompatible with Denmark's constitution and if the Faroese political parties wish to continue with it, then they must declare independence.<ref>[http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2011/07/06/denmark-and-faroe-islands-in-constitutional-clash/ Denmark and Faroe Islands in constitutional clash], IceNews 6 July 2011</ref>\n\n=== Relationship with the European Union ===\n{{main|Faroe Islands and the European Union}}\nAs explicitly asserted by both [[treaties of the European Union]], the Faroe Islands are not part of the [[European Union]]. The Faroes are not grouped with the EU when it comes to international trade; for instance, when the EU and Russia imposed reciprocal trade sanctions on each other over the [[War in Donbass]] in 2014, the Faroes began exporting significant amounts of fresh [[salmon]] to Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/faeroe-islands-boom-by-selling-salmon-to-russia-1424483776|title=Faeroe Islands Boom by Selling Salmon to Russia|first=Anton|last=Troianovski|date=21 February 2015|publisher=|via=Wall Street Journal}}</ref> Moreover, a [[special member state territories and the European Union#Faroe Islands|protocol]] to the treaty of accession of Denmark to the European Communities stipulates that Danish nationals residing in the Faroe Islands are not considered Danish nationals within the meaning of the treaties. Hence, Danish people living in the Faroes are not [[citizenship of the European Union|citizens of the European Union]] (though other EU nationals living there remain EU citizens). The Faroes are not covered by the [[Schengen Agreement]], but there are no border checks when travelling between the Faroes and any Schengen country (the Faroes have been part of the [[Nordic Passport Union]] since 1966, and since 2001 there have been no permanent border checks between the Nordic countries and the rest of the [[Schengen Area]] as part of the Schengen agreement).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tinganes.fo/logir/Rikislogartilmaeli/2001Schengen.htm |title=Implementation of Schengen convention by the prime minister as approved by the L\u00f8gting |publisher=Tinganes.fo |date= |accessdate=25 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721114619/http://www.tinganes.fo/logir/Rikislogartilmaeli/2001Schengen.htm |archive-date=21 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Relationship with international organisations ===\nThe Faroe Islands are not a fully independent country, but they do have political relations directly with other countries through agreement with Denmark.

Later, when the Vikings colonised the islands, there was a considerable increase in the population. However, it never exceeded 5,000 until the 19th century. Around 1349, about half the population perished in the [[Black Death]] plague.\n\nOnly with the rise of the deep-sea fishery (and thus independence from agriculture in the islands' harsh terrain) and with general progress in the health service was rapid population growth possible in the Faroes. Beginning in the 19th century, the population increased tenfold in 200 years.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1990s, the Faroe Islands entered a deep economic crisis leading to heavy emigration; however, this trend reversed in subsequent years to a net immigration. This has been in the form of a population replacement as young Faroese women leave and are replaced with Asian/Pacific brides.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-24637771|title=Faroe Islands: Men 'must import brides'|work=BBC News|date=23 October 2013}}</ref>\nIn 2011, there were 2,155 more men than women between the age of 0 to 59 in the Faroe Islands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in.fo/news-detail/news/faid-kvinnurnar-heimaftur/|title=F\u00e1i\u00f0 kvinnurnar heimaftur|last=Rana|first=Danjal av|date=22 January 2015|publisher=Sosialurin \u2013 in.fo|language=Faroese|accessdate=4 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Faroese population is spread across most of the area; it was not until recent decades that significant urbanisation occurred. Industrialisation has been remarkably decentralised, and the area has therefore maintained quite a viable rural culture. Nevertheless, villages with poor harbour facilities have been the losers in the development from agriculture to fishing, and in the most peripheral agricultural areas, also known as [[\u00datoyggjar]] \"Outer Islands\", there are few young people. In recent decades, the village-based social structure has nevertheless been placed under pressure, giving way to a rise in interconnected \"centres\" that are better able to provide goods and services than the badly connected periphery. This means that shops and services are now relocating en masse from the villages into the centres, and slowly but steadily the Faroese population is concentrating in and around the centres.\n\nIn the 1990s, the government abandoned the old national policy of developing the villages (Bygdamenning), and instead began a process of regional development (\u00d8kismenning). The term \"region\" referred to the large islands of the Faroes. Nevertheless, the government was unable to press through the structural reform of merging small rural municipalities to create sustainable, decentralised entities that could drive forward regional development. As regional development has been difficult on the administrative level, the government has instead invested heavily in infrastructure, interconnecting the regions.\n\nIn general, it is becoming less valid to regard the Faroes as a society based on separate islands and regions. The huge investments in roads, bridges and sub-sea tunnels (see also [[Transport in the Faroe Islands]]) have bound the islands together, creating a coherent economic and cultural sphere that covers almost 90% of the population. From this perspective it is reasonable to regard the Faroes as a dispersed city or even to refer to it as the ''Faroese Network City''.{{citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\n[[File:Faroe stamp 048 europe (v u hammershaimb).jpg|thumb|upright|A stamp commemorating [[V.

It is difficult to say exactly how many people worldwide speak the Faroese language, because many ethnic Faroese live in Denmark, and few who are born there return to the Faroes with their parents or as adults.\n\nFaroese belongs to the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] branch of [[Indo-European languages]]. Written Faroese (grammar and vocabulary) is most similar to [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and to their ancestor [[Old Norse]], though the spoken language is closer to [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] dialects of [[Western Norway]]. Faroese is the first official language of the island while [[Danish language|Danish]], the second, is taught in schools and can be used by the Faroese government in public relations.<ref name=\"folang\"/>\n\nFaroese language policy provides for the active creation of new terms in Faroese suitable for modern life.\n\n=== Religion ===\n{{main|Religion in the Faroe Islands}}\nAccording to the ''[[F\u00e6reyinga saga]]'', [[Sigmundur Brestisson]] brought Christianity to the islands in 999.

According to official statistics from 2019, 79.7% of the Faroese population are members of the state church, the [[Church of the Faroe Islands]] (F\u00f3lkakirkjan), following a form of [[Lutheranism]].<ref>[https://statbank.hagstova.fo/pxweb/en/H2/H2__MM__MM03/atrud_prgj.px/ Parishes, 1st January (2000-2019)] Statistics Faroe Islands</ref> The F\u00f3lkakirkjan became an independent church in 2007; previously it had been a diocese within the [[Church of Denmark]]. Faroese members of the clergy who have had historical importance include [[Venceslaus Ulricus Hammershaimb]] (1819\u20131909), [[Fr\u00ed\u00f0rikur Petersen]] (1853\u20131917) and, perhaps most significantly, [[J\u00e1kup Dahl]] (1878\u20131944), who had a great influence in ensuring that the [[Faroese language]] was spoken in the church instead of [[Danish language|Danish]]. Participation in churches is more prevalent among the Faroese population than among most other Scandinavians.\n\nIn the late 1820s, the Christian [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] religious movement, the [[Plymouth Brethren]], was established in England. In 1865, a member of this movement, [[William Gibson Sloan]], travelled to the Faroes from [[Shetland]]. At the turn of the 20th century, the Faroese Plymouth Brethren numbered thirty. Today, around 10% of the Faroese population are members of the Open Brethren community (''Br\u00f8\u00f0rasamkoman''). About 3% belong to the [[Charismatic Movement]]. There are several charismatic churches around the islands, the largest of which, called Keldan (The Spring), has about 200 to 300 members. About 2% belong to other Christian groups. The [[Adventism|Adventists]] operate a private school in T\u00f3rshavn. [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] also have four congregations with a total of 121 members. The Roman Catholic congregation has about 170 members and falls under the jurisdiction of Denmark's [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Copenhagen]]. The municipality of [[T\u00f3rshavn]] has an old [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] school.\n[[File:Kunoy, Faroe Islands (2).JPG|thumb|Church in [[Kunoy]]]]\n\nThere are also around fifteen [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith|Bah\u00e1'\u00eds]] who meet at four different places. The [[Ahmadiyya]]s established a community in the Faroe Islands in 2010. Unlike [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]] and [[Iceland]] with [[Heathenry (new religious movement)#Forn Si\u00f0r|Forn Si\u00f0r]], the Faroes have no organised Heathen community.\n\nThe best-known church buildings in the Faroe Islands include [[T\u00f3rshavn Cathedral]], [[Olaf II of Norway]]'s Church and the [[Magnus Cathedral]] in [[Kirkjub\u00f8ur]]; the Vesturkirkjan and the Maria Church, both of which are situated in T\u00f3rshavn; the church of [[F\u00e1mjin]]; the octagonal church in [[Hald\u00f3rsv\u00edk]]; Christianskirkjan in [[Klaksv\u00edk]]; and also the two pictured here.\n\nIn 1948, Victor Danielsen (Plymouth Brethren) completed the first Bible translation into Faroese from different modern languages. Jacob Dahl and Kristian Osvald Vider\u00f8 (F\u00f3lkakirkjan) completed the second translation in 1961. The latter was translated from the original Biblical languages ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]) into Faroese.\n\nAccording to the 2011 Census, there were 33,018 Christians (95.44%), 23 Muslims (0.07%), 7 [[Hindu]]s (0.02%), 66 [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] (0.19%), 12 [[Jews]] (0.03%), 13 Baha'i (0.04%), 3 [[Sikhism|Sikhs]] (0.01%), 149 others (0.43%), 85 with more than one belief (0.25%), and 1,397 with no religion (4.04%).<ref>{{cite web|title=CS 10.1.2 Population by religious faith, educational attainment, occupation, country of birth, year of arrival in the country and place of usual residence.|url=http://www.hagstova.fo/en/statbank/census/2011/religion/religion-educaton-and-country-of-birth|website=Statistics Faroe Islands|accessdate=1 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002070910/http://www.hagstova.fo/en/statbank/census/2011/religion/religion-educaton-and-country-of-birth|archive-date=2 October 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Education ===\n{{main|Education in the Faroe Islands}}\nThe levels of education in the Faroe Islands are [[primary education|primary]], [[secondary education|secondary]] and [[higher education|higher]] education.

Students that complete compulsory education are allowed to continue education in a [[vocational school]], where they can have job-specific training and education. Since the fishing industry is an important part of [[Economy of the Faroe Islands|country's economy]], maritime schools are an important part of Faroese education. Upon completion of the tenth year of F\u00f3lkask\u00fali, students can continue to upper secondary education which consists of several different types of schools. Higher education is offered at the [[University of the Faroe Islands]]; a part of Faroese youth moves abroad to pursue higher education, mainly in [[Denmark]].

The Faroe Islands were long isolated from the main cultural phases and movements that swept across parts of Europe. This means that they have maintained a great part of their traditional culture. The language spoken is [[Faroese language|Faroese]], which is one of three insular [[North Germanic languages]] descended from the [[Old Norse]] language spoken in Scandinavia in the [[Viking Age]], the others being [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and the extinct [[Norn language|Norn]], which is thought to have been mutually intelligible with Faroese. Until the 15th century, Faroese had a similar orthography to Icelandic and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], but after the Reformation in 1538, the ruling [[Norway|Norwegians]] outlawed its use in schools, churches and official documents. Although a rich spoken tradition survived, for 300 years the language was not written down. This means that all poems and stories were handed down orally. These works were split into the following divisions: sagnir (historical), \u00e6vint\u00fdr (stories) and [[kv\u00e6\u00f0i]] (ballads), often set to music and the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] chain dance. These were eventually written down in the 19th century.\n\n===Faroese literature===\n{{main|Faroese literature}}\n[[File:Faroe stamp 364 rasmussen and skardi.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Regin \u00ed L\u00ed\u00f0|Rasmus Rasmussen]], the writer who wrote the first novel in the [[Faroese language]] (poetical name: Regin \u00ed L\u00ed\u00f0) and [[S\u00edmun av Skar\u00f0i]], the poet who wrote the Faroese national hymn]]\nFaroese written literature has only really developed in the past 100\u2013200 years. This is mainly because of the islands' isolation, and also because the [[Faroese language]] was not written down in a standardised format until 1890. The Danish language was also encouraged at the expense of Faroese. Nevertheless, the Faroes have produced several authors and poets. A rich centuries-old oral tradition of folk tales and Faroese folk songs accompanied the [[Faroese dance|Faroese chain dance]]. The people learned these songs and stories by heart, and told or sang them to each other, teaching the younger generations too. This kind of literature was gathered in the 19th century and early 20th century. The Faroese folk songs, in Faroese called ''kv\u00e6\u00f0i'', are still in use although not so large-scale as earlier. Some of the Faroese folk songs have been used by the Faroese Viking metal band [[T\u00fdr (band)|T\u00fdr]], i.e., ''[[Ormurin Langi]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Ormurin-Langi/dp/B0042GGCG4 |title=Ormurin Langi: T\u00fdr: MP3 Downloads |date=31 August 2010 |accessdate=14 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe first [[List of novels written in Faroese|Faroese novel]], ''B\u00e1belstorni\u00f0'' by [[Regin \u00ed L\u00ed\u00f0]], was published in 1909; the second novel was published 18 years later.

Some of these writers have been nominated for the [[Nordic Council's Literature Prize]] two to six times, but have never won it.

[[B\u00e1r\u00f0ur Oskarsson]] (born 1972) is a children's book writer and illustrator; his books won prizes in the Faroes, Germany and the [[West Nordic Council's Children and Youth Literature Prize]] (2006). Though not born in the Faroe Islands, Matthew Landrum an American poet and editor for the Structo magazine, has written a collection of poems about the Islands.

Multiple Danish Music Award winner [[Teitur Lassen]] calls the Faroes home and is arguably the islands' most internationally well-known musical export.\n\nThe Islands have their own [[orchestra]] (the classical ensemble ''Aldub\u00e1ran'') and many different choirs; the best-known of these is ''Havnark\u00f3ri\u00f0''. The best-known local Faroese composers are [[Sunleif Rasmussen]] and [[Kristian Blak]], who is also head of the record company [[Tutl]]. The first Faroese opera was by Sunleif Rasmussen. It is entitled ''\u00cd \u00d3\u00f0amansgar\u00f0i'' (The Madman's Garden) and was premiered on 12 October 2006 at the Nordic House. The opera is based on a short story by the writer [[William Heinesen]].\n\nYoung Faroese musicians who have gained much popularity recently are [[Eiv\u00f8r P\u00e1lsd\u00f3ttir]], Anna Katrin Egilstr\u00f8\u00f0, Lena (Lena Andersen), [[H\u00f8gni Reistrup]], [[H\u00f8gni Lisberg]], HEI\u00d0RIK ([[Hei\u00f0rik \u00e1 Heygum]]), [[Gu\u00f0ri\u00f0 Hansd\u00f3ttir]] and [[Brandur Enni]].\n\nWell-known bands include [[T\u00fdr (band)|T\u00fdr]], Gestir, [[Hamfer\u00f0]], [[The Ghost (Faroese band)|The Ghost]], [[Boys in a Band]], ORKA, [[:fo:200 (rokkb\u00f3lkur)|200]], Grandma's Basement, [[Sic (band)|SIC]], and the former band Clickhaze.\n\nThe festival of contemporary and classical music, ''Summart\u00f3nar'', is held each summer. The [[G! Festival]] in [[Nor\u00f0rag\u00f8ta]] in July and [[Summarfestivalurin]] in [[Klaksv\u00edk]] in August are both large, open-air music festivals for popular music with both local and international musicians participating. Havnar Jazzfelag was established 21 November 1975, and is still active. Currently Havnar Jazzfelag is arranging VetrarJazz amongst other jazz-festivals in The Faroe Islands.\n\n===The Nordic House in the Faroe Islands===\nThe [[Nordic House in the Faroe Islands]] ({{lang-fo|Nor\u00f0urlandah\u00fasi\u00f0}}) is the most important cultural institution in the Faroes. Its aim is to support and promote [[Scandinavia]]n and Faroese culture, locally and in the Nordic region. [[Erlendur Patursson]] (1913\u201386), Faroese member of the [[Nordic Council]], raised the idea of a Nordic cultural house in the Faroe Islands. A Nordic competition for architects was held in 1977, in which 158 architects participated. Winners were Ola Steen from [[Norway]] and Kolbr\u00fan Ragnarsd\u00f3ttir from [[Iceland]]. By staying true to [[folklore]], the architects built the Nordic House to resemble an enchanted hill of [[elf|elves]]. The house opened in [[T\u00f3rshavn]] in 1983. The Nordic House is a cultural organization under the Nordic Council. The Nordic House is run by a steering committee of eight, of whom three are Faroese and five from other Nordic countries. There is also a local advisory body of fifteen members, representing Faroese cultural organizations. The House is managed by a director appointed by the steering committee for a four-year term.\n\n===Traditional food===\n{{main|Faroese cuisine}}\nTraditional Faroese food is mainly based on meat, seafood and potatoes and uses few fresh vegetables. Mutton of the [[Faroe sheep]] is the basis of many meals, and one of the most popular treats is ''[[skerpikj\u00f8t]]'', well aged, wind-dried mutton, which is quite chewy. The drying shed, known as a ''hjallur'', is a standard feature in many Faroese homes, particularly in the small towns and villages. Other traditional foods are ''r\u00e6st kj\u00f8t'' (semi-dried mutton) and ''r\u00e6stur fiskur'', matured fish. Another Faroese specialty is ''[[tv\u00f8st og spik]]'', made from [[pilot whale]] meat and [[blubber]]. (A parallel meat/fat dish made with [[offal]] is ''[[garnat\u00e1lg]]''.) The tradition of consuming meat and blubber from pilot whales arises from the fact that a single kill can provide many meals. Fresh fish also features strongly in the traditional local diet, as do [[seabird]]s, such as [[Faroese puffin]]s, and their eggs. Dried fish is also commonly eaten.\n[[File:Dog as truck driver.jpg|thumb|right|Truck delivering [[Cadbury]] chocolate in the Faroe Islands]]\nThere are two breweries in the Faroe Islands. The first brewery is called [[F\u00f6roya Bj\u00f3r]] and has produced beer since 1888 with exports mainly to Iceland and Denmark. The second brewery is called Okkara Bryggjar\u00ed and was founded in 2010. A local specialty is ''fredrikk'', a special brew made in [[N\u00f3lsoy]]. Production of hard alcohol such as [[snaps]] is forbidden in the Faroe Islands, hence the Faroese [[akvavit]] is produced abroad.\n\nSince the friendly British occupation, the Faroese have been fond of British food, in particular [[fish and chips]] and British-style chocolate such as [[Cadbury Dairy Milk]], which is found in many of the island's shops.<ref>{{cite news |title=Nordic holiday ideas |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/sep/02/scandinavia-holidays-sweden-lapland |work=The Guardian |date=2 September 2011|last = Dixon|first = Rachel}}</ref>\n\n===Whaling===\n{{main|Whaling in the Faroe Islands}}\n[[File:Whaling in the Faroe Islands in August 2012.JPG|thumb|Boats driving a pod of pilot whales into a bay of [[Su\u00f0uroy]] in 2012]]\nThere are records of drive hunts in the Faroe Islands dating from 1584.<ref>{{cite book |first=Philippa |last=Brakes |chapter=A background to whaling |year=2004 |editor=Philippa Brakes |editor2=Andrew Butterworth |editor3=Mark Simmonds |editor4=Philip Lymbery |title=Troubled Waters: A Review of the Welfare Implications of Modern Whaling Activities |isbn=0-9547065-0-1 |page=7 |chapter-url=http://www.wdcs.org/submissions_bin/troubledwaters.pdf}}</ref> [[Whaling in the Faroe Islands]] is regulated by Faroese authorities but not by the [[International Whaling Commission]] as there are disagreements about the Commission's legal authority to regulate [[cetacea]]n hunts. Hundreds of [[long-finned pilot whale]]s (''Globicephala melaena'') could be killed in a year, mainly during the summer. The hunts, called ''grindadr\u00e1p'' in Faroese, are non-commercial and are organized on a community level; anyone can participate. When a whale pod by chance is spotted near land the participating hunters first surround the pilot whales with a wide semicircle of boats and then slowly and quietly begin to drive the whales towards the chosen authorised bay.<ref name=\"Home\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whaling.fo/en/home/|title=Home|publisher=}}</ref> When a pod of whales has been stranded the killing is begun.\n\nFaroese animal welfare legislation, which also applies to whaling, requires that animals are killed as quickly and with as little suffering as possible. A regulation spinal lance is used to sever the [[spinal cord]], which also severs the major blood supply to the brain, ensuring both loss of consciousness and death within seconds. The spinal lance has been introduced as preferred standard equipment for killing pilot whales and has been shown to reduce killing time to 1\u20132 seconds.<ref name=\"Home\"/>\n\nThis \"grindadr\u00e1p\" is legal and provides food for many people in the Faroe Islands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whaling.fo/thepilot.htm#Drivingthewhales |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324072829/http://www.whaling.fo/thepilot.htm |title=Whales and whaling in the Faroe Islands |publisher=Faroese Government |accessdate=5 December 2006 |archivedate=24 March 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wdcs.org/dan/publishing.nsf/allweb/99E632F7502FCC3B802568F20048794C |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031231236/http://www.wdcs.org/dan/publishing.nsf/allweb/99E632F7502FCC3B802568F20048794C |title=Why do whales and dolphins strand? |publisher=[[WDCS]] |accessdate=5 December 2006 |archivedate=31 October 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Nicole|last=Chrismar|date=28 July 2006|title=Dolphins Hunted for Sport and Fertilizer|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=2248161&page=1|publisher=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=21 July 2009}}</ref> However, a study has found whale meat and blubber to currently be contaminated with [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and not recommended for human consumption, as too much may cause such adverse health effects as birth defects of the nervous system, high blood pressure, damaged immune system, increased risk for developing [[Parkinson's disease]], [[hypertension]], [[arteriosclerosis]], and [[Diabetes mellitus type 2]]:\n{{quote|Therefore we recommend that adults eat no more than one to two meals a month.

Many young people study and move abroad, and this helps them maintain cultural links with their specific Faroese heritage.\n\nThere has also been a great interest in Faroese [[sweater]]s<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/10/sarah-lund-jumper-copyright-the-killing|title=Sarah Lund's jumper is exhibit A in a legal battle|first=Mark|last=Townsend|date=9 August 2014|work=The Guardian}}</ref> from the TV series ''[[The Killing (Danish TV series)|The Killing]]'', where the main actress (Detective Inspector Sarah Lund, played by [[Sofie Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l]]) wears Faroese sweaters.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/9533226/Fans-of-The-Killing-can-now-knit-their-own-Sarah-Lund-jumper.html|title=Fans of 'The Killing' can now knit their own Sarah Lund jumper|last=Hall|first=James|date=2012-09-10|access-date=2020-01-28|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>\n\n[[Lace knitting]] is a traditional handicraft. The most distinctive trait of [[Faroese lace shawls]] is the centre-back [[gusset]] shaping. Each shawl consists of two triangular side panels, a trapezoid-shaped back gusset, an edge treatment, and usually shoulder shaping. These are worn by all generations of women, particularly as part of the traditional Faroese costume as an overgarment.\n\n[[File:Faroese folk dance club from vagar.jpg|thumb|left|Faroese folk dancers, some of them in national costume]]\nThe traditional Faroese national dress is also a local handicraft that people spend a lot of time, money, and effort to assemble. It is worn at weddings and traditional dancing events, and on feast days. The cultural significance of the garment should not be underestimated, both as an expression of local and national identity and a passing on and reinforcing of traditional skills that bind local communities together.\n\nA young Faroese person is normally handed down a set of children's Faroese clothes that have passed from generation to generation. Children are [[confirmed]] at age 14, and normally start to collect the pieces to make an adult outfit, which is considered as a rite of passage. Traditionally the aim would have been to complete the outfit by the time a young person was ready to marry and wear the clothes at the ceremony\u2014though it is mainly only men who do this now.\n\nEach piece is intricately hand-knitted, dyed, woven or embroidered to the specifications of the wearer. For example, the man's waistcoat is put together by hand in bright blue, red or black fine wool. The front is then intricately embroidered with colourful silk threads, often by a female relative. The motifs are often local Faroese flowers or herbs. After this, a row of Faroese-made solid silver buttons are sewn on the outfit.\n\nWomen wear embroidered silk, cotton or wool shawls and pinafores that can take months to weave or embroider with local flora and fauna. They are also adorned with a handwoven black and red ankle-length skirt, knitted black and red jumper, a velvet belt, and black 18th century style shoes with silver buckles. The outfit is held together by a row of solid silver buttons, silver chains and locally-made silver brooches and belt buckles, often fashioned with Viking style motifs.\n\nBoth men's and women's national dress are extremely costly and can take many years to assemble. Women in the family often work together to assemble the outfits, including knitting the close-fitting jumpers, weaving and embroidering, sewing and assembling the national dress.\n\nThis tradition binds together families, passes on traditional crafts, and reinforces the Faroese culture of traditional village life in the context of a modern society.\n\n===Public holidays===\n[[File:F\u00f8roysk fl\u00f8gg \u00e1 \u00d3lavs\u00f8ku.jpg|thumb|The annual ''\u00d3lavs\u00f8ka'' parade on 28 July 2005.]]\n{{see also|Public holidays in Denmark}}\n''[[\u00d3lavs\u00f8ka]]'' is on 29 July; it commemorates the death of [[Saint Olaf]].

{"title_page": "Gender mainstreaming", "text_new": "{{Feminism sidebar |theory}}\n\n'''Gender mainstreaming''' is the [[public policy]] concept of assessing the different implications for people of different genders of any planned [[policy]] action, including [[legislation]] and [[Program (management)|programmes]], in all areas and levels. Mainstreaming essentially offers a pluralistic approach that values the diversity among people of different genders.\n\nThe concept of gender mainstreaming was first proposed at the 1985 Third World Conference on Women in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]]. The idea has been pushed in the [[United Nations]] development community. The idea was formally featured in 1995 at the [[Fourth World Conference on Women]] in [[Beijing]], [[China]], and was cited in the document that resulted from the conference, the [[Beijing Platform for Action]].\n\n== Definition ==\nMost definitions of gender mainstreaming conform to the UN [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]] formally defined concept:\n: Mainstreaming a gender perspective is the process of assessing the implications for women and men of any planned action, including legislation, policies or programmes, in all areas and at all levels. It is a strategy for making women's as well as men's concerns and experiences an integral dimension of the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes in all political, economic and societal spheres so that women and men benefit equally and inequality is not perpetuated. The ultimate goal is to achieve [[gender equality]].<ref>United Nations. \"[https://www.un.org/documents/ga/docs/52/plenary/a52-3.htm Report of the Economic and Social Council for 1997]\". A/52/3.18 September 1997.</ref>\nThere are different approaches to gender mainstreaming:\n\n''Institutional perspective:''  The ways in which specific organizations adopt and implement mainstreaming policies. This will often involve an analysis of how national politics intersects with international norms and practices.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Gender Matters in Global Politics: A Feminist Introduction to International Relations|last=Shepard|first=Laura J.|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>\n\n''Discursive'' ''perspective:'' Queries the ways in which mainstreaming reproduces power relations through language and issue-framing. This approach will often involve looking at documents, resolutions and peace agreements to see how they reproduce the narratives of gender in a political context.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThese approaches are not necessarily competing, and can be seen as complementary.\n\nThe ways in which approaches are used, however, can also reflect differing feminist theories. For example, ''liberal feminism'' is strongly invoked by mainstreaming through the binary approach of gender in strict relation to the public sphere of policymaking. ''Poststructuralist feminism'' can be seen in mainstreaming thought which seeks to displace gender difference as the sole axis of difference and to highlight the diversity of policy its ramifications.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Principles==\n[[File:Col.

Gender Mainstreaming in the European Constitution-Making Process\", Social Politics 12(3): 417</ref>\n\nLombardo notes that \"[t]here should be evidence that [[gender equality]] objective and policies of special concern for women (for example, [[social policy]]) have been prioritized in the organization among competing objectives (in terms of financial and human resources, type of measures adopted, voting systems used, and so forth).\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Incorporating gender into politics and decision making===\n\nPuechguirbal takes a discursive approach to argue that in order to successfully mainstream a gendered perspective in politics, language needs to be reevaluated and used to change the parameters of how women are perceived.\n\nHistorically, documents concerning international agreements, peacekeeping arrangements and legal resolutions have perpetuated stereotypes that disempower women. This can be seen through the use of language, even as simply as in the UN Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration program's (DDR) motto: 'One man, on weapon'.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nReference of gender issues should be found in all [[policy]] areas. \"There must be evidence that the [[mainstream]] political agenda has been reoriented by rethinking and rearticulating [[policy]] ends and means from a gender perspective,\" Lombardo says, referencing [[Rounaq Jahan]], a political scientists, feminist leader and author.<ref name=\"Lombardo, E. 2005\">Lombardo, E., (2005) \"Integrating or Setting the Agenda?

Various feminist research has concluded that men and women experience violent conflict differently and moreover, the current policies surrounding PCPB are insufficient in addressing the disadvantaged position of women in male-dominated power structures that are further reinforced by peace-building efforts, both from the domestic and international communities. Gender mainstreaming in PCPB would emphasize the importance of gendered considerations of particular issues that disproportionally affect women in post-conflict settings. This would mean that policy reflected an acknowledgment of the many instances of wartime sexualized violence perpetrated on women, among other issues that (primarily) women face during conflict. A major focus of the effort towards gender mainstreaming in post-conflict peace-building policy is to lessen the international community's inclination towards building a return to 'normal' for the post-conflict region. Much of feminist research has found that returning to 'normal' is of little comfort for women, who were burdened by the patriarchal systems that were in place before conflict broke out. As Handrahan<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Handrahan|first=Lori|date=|title=Conflict, gender, ethnicity and post-conflict reconstruction|url=|journal=Security Dialogue|volume=35|pages=429\u2013445|via=University of Victoria library database}}</ref> notes, the international community involved in much of PCPB \"tolerates high levels of violence against women in their own societies.\" Policy that prioritized gender in its applications and goals would seek to build a society where women are better off than they were before conflict broke out.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Shifts in institutional culture===\n\nGender mainstreaming can be seen as a process of organizational change.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bibbings|first=Sharleene May|title=The politics of mainstreaming in critical perspective|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Pub.|location=Newcastle upon Tyne|isbn=9781443835121}}</ref> Gender mainstreaming must be institutionalized through concrete steps, mechanisms, and processes in all parts of the organization.<ref name=\"Charlesworth, H 2005\"/> According to Lombardo, this change involves three aspects: [[policy]] process, [[policy]] mechanisms; and [[policy]] actors. She explains as follows:\n\n\"1. A shift in [[policy]] process means that the process \"is reorganized so that ordinary actors know how to incorporate a gender perspective\" or that gender expertise is included \"as normal requirement for [[policy]]-makers\" (Council of Europe 1998, 165<ref>Council of Europe. 1998. Gender Mainstreaming: Conceptual Framework, Methodology and Presentation of Good Practices: Final Report of Activities of the Group of Specialists on Mainstreaming. EG-S-MS. Strasbourg: Council of Europe</ref>).\n\n2. A shift in [[policy]] mechanism involves (a) the adoption of horizontal cooperation on [[gender]] issues across all [[policy]] areas, levels, and departments; and (b) the use of appropriate [[policy]] tools and techniques to integrate the gender variable in all policies and to monitor and evaluate all policies from a [[gender]] perspective.\n\n3. The range of [[policy]] actors participating in the policy-making process is broadened to include, apart from policy-makers and civil servants, gender experts and civil society.\"<ref>Lombardo, E., (2005) \"Integrating or Setting the Agenda? Gender Mainstreaming in the European Constitution-Making Process\", Social Politics 12(3): 417-18</ref>\n\n== Gender budgeting ==\n{{Main|Gender budgeting}}\n\nGender budgeting encompasses activities and initiatives aiming at the preparation of [[budget]]s or the analysis of policies and budgets from a gender perspective. It can also be referred to as gender-sensitive budgeting or gender-responsive budgeting. Gender budgeting does not aim at creating separate budgets for women, or only increasing spending on women\u2019s programmes. It is rather concerned with addressing budgetary [[gender inequality]] concerns, as for instance, how gender hierarchies influence budgets, and gender-based unpaid or low paid work.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002316/231646e.pdf|title=A Guide for Gender Equality in Teacher Education Policy and Practices|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100069-0|location=|pages=72\u201375}}</ref>\n\n==Examples==\nAs Jacqui True says, \"[m]ainstreaming was established as a global strategy for achieving [[gender equality]], and in turn for achieving sustainable economic development in the 1995 [[Beijing Platform for Action]] ratified by all [[United Nations]] member states. It is now incumbent upon nation-states and international organizations to carry out gender mainstreaming. As such, mainstreaming has achieved widespread endorsement by individual governments, regional supra-state bodies.\"<ref>True, Jacqui, Mainstreaming Gender in Global Public Policy, International Feminist Journal of Politics, 2010, 369</ref> What follows is a non-exhaustive list of examples of these endorsements.\n\n===Nicaragua===\nThe election of 1990 in [[Nicaragua]] brought to office the first female [[President (government title)|president]] in the Americas.

In 1993 the existing outdated Sandinista Women's organization, the Nicaraguan Institute for Research on Women, was revitalized and renamed by the Chamorro government as the Nicaraguan Institute for Woman (INIM).

Local feminist organizations have different views on gender mainstreaming. Some groups considered that the Commission on Women Rights Promotion under [[Executive Yuan]] should be expanded, while other groups, including the [[National Alliance of Taiwan Women's Associations]], considered that gender mainstreaming is not promotion of women's rights but an assessment of all policies and requires a specific organization.<ref>Lin, Fang-Mei. \"\u6027\u5225\u4e3b\u6d41\u5316\u5728\u53f0\u7063\uff1a\u5f9e\u570b\u969b\u767c\u5c55\u5230\u5728\u5730\u5316\u5be6\u8e10\".

It opened important opportunities for specific policies in new [[policy]] areas, whereas in some other it diluted [[positive action]]. She also claims that, at least as of 2003, gender mainstreaming has failed to affect core [[policy]] areas or radically transform [[policy]] processes within the European Institutions.<ref name=\"Stratigaki, M 2005\">Stratigaki, M., (2005) \"Gender Mainstreaming vs Positive Action. An Ongoing Conflict in EU Gender Equality Policy\", ''European Journal of Women's Studies'' 12 (2): 165-186.</ref>\n\nSome say that gender mainstreaming has not increased women's participation in decision making. As Charlesworth notes, \"[i]n the most readily measurable area, the United Nations' employment of women in professional and managerial posts, progress has been glacial. In 2004, women held 37.4 percent of these positions. The annual growth rate toward the 50 percent target [...] is predicted to be 0.4 percent. On top of this slow growth, there is a considerable hierarchy based on sex. On June 30, 2004, women held 83.3 percent of positions at the lowest professional level, P-1, but just 16.7 percent at the highest staff level, Under-Secretary-General.\"<ref name=\"Charlesworth, H 2005\"/> In a similar vein, concerning the [[European Union]], Lombardo reports that as of 2003 women represented only 20 percent of the representatives of the head of state or government the member states, 10 percent of the representatives of national parliaments, 31.25 percent of the representatives of the [[European Parliament]] and so forth.<ref>Lombardo, E., (2005) \"Integrating or Setting the Agenda? Gender Mainstreaming in the European Constitution-Making Process\", Social Politics 12(3): 422</ref>\n\nTrue claims that mainstreaming gender does not end in simply increasing the number of women within a specific institution. It is about changing social consciousness, so that the effects of a policy for both women and men are truly analyzed before they are implemented. While it is necessary for [[feminists]] to engage with mainstream institutions, the ability of gender mainstreaming to deconstruct the embedded masculinization of institutions varies depending on the characteristics of the policy, the political nature of the institution, and the depth of the institution's consultation with civil society and other members of the women's rights movement.<ref>\"True, J. (2010) \"Mainstreaming Gender in International Relations\". ''Gender Matters in Global Politics'' (New York: Routledge) L.J. Shepherd (Ed.) 194\"</ref> The danger of gender mainstreaming is that large compromises can be made for small gains and can lead to what feminist and sociology professor Carol Dines calls \"trickle-down [[feminism]]\"\u2014i.e., \"working to increase the ranks of women in elite jobs without a strategy for wider economic and social change represents a kind of \"trickle-down [[feminism]].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/25/having-it-all-women-anne-marie-slaughter |title='Having it all' looks very different for women stuck in low-paid jobs &#124; Gail Dines &#124; Comment is free |publisher=theguardian.com |date=2014-04-23 |accessdate=2014-06-05}}</ref>\n\n===Poor implementation===\nCharlesworth remarks that \"[a]lthough it has not been difficult to encourage the adoption of the vocabulary of mainstreaming, there is little evidence of monitoring or follow-up. A consistent problem for all the organizations that adopted gender mainstreaming is the translation of the commitment into action.\"<ref name=\"Charlesworth, H 2005\"/> She continues: \"A review of gender mainstreaming policies implemented under the [[United Nations Development Programme]], [[World Bank]], and [[ILO]] found inadequate budgeting for the gender components of projects, insufficient development of analytical skills, poor supervision of the implementation of gender components and a general lack of political commitment both within the organization and at the country level.\"<ref name=\"Charlesworth, H 2005\"/>\n\n===Hindering progress===\nStratigaki claims that [[positive action]] was sidelined after the launch of gender mainstreaming as a result of the specific way gender mainstreaming was used by the opponents of [[gender equality]]. According to Stratigaki, \"[a]lmost all analyses of [gender mainstreaming] agree that it is a strategy which complements but does not replace previous gender specific equality policies like equal treatment legislation and positive action.\" However, she states too that \"in a hostile gender equality policy environments (i.e. patriarchal structures of institutional organisations or the prevalence of policy objectives contrary to gender equality etc.), [gender mainstreaming] may be conceived and applied as an alternative to positive action and used to downplay the final overall objective of [[gender equality]].<ref name=\"Stratigaki, M 2005\"/>\n\nTrue is of the opinion that in practice, attempts to mainstream gender within international institutions have led to the marginalization and increasing invisibility of gender in each policy area. Anne-Marie Goetz, a Clinical Professor at [[NYU]], and Joanne Sandler, a consultant for gender equality and organizational development, argue that ironically, mainstreaming gender runs the risk of becoming everyone's responsibility, yet nobody's at the same time.<ref name=\"True, J., 2010, p. 196\">True, Jacqui (2010). Laura J. Shepherd, ed. ''Gender Mainstreaming in International Institutions''. New York: Routledge. p. 196</ref> Gender mainstreaming can allow those in power who are not genuinely interested in the women's movement to adopt the language of women's rights, a reflection of power politics that becomes more of a tool used to legitimize the actions of governments. Gender mainstreaming then becomes more about advising governments than advancing gender equality.<ref name=\"True, J., 2010, p. 198\">True, Jacqui (2010). Laura J. Shepherd, ed. ''Mainstreaming Gender in International Institutions''. New York: Routledge. p. 198</ref>\n\n===Other criticism===\n\nAs differences are silenced, the kind of [[feminism]] that is likely to be mainstreamed could be a western or middle class brand of feminism. When mainstreaming decisions within international organizations are made by elites can undermine the input of local women's groups.<ref name=Palmary>{{cite journal|author1=Palmary, I.|author2=Nunez, L.|year=2009|title=The Orthodoxy of Gender Mainstreaming: Reflecting on Gender Mainstreaming as Strategy for Accomplishing the Millennium Development Goals|journal=Journal of Health Management|volume=11|issue=65|pages=65\u201378|doi=10.1177/097206340901100105}}</ref>{{rp|72}}\n\nWhen gender mainstreaming policies are drafted without consulting sections of the women's movement (i.e., women's rights civil society groups), they lack ground level-expertise. [[Policy]] decisions related to gender that are made without consulting sections of the women's movement do not demonstrate a clear political willingness to addressing gender inequality. When institutions reach out to the women's rights movement, it demonstrates transparency, inclusiveness, accountability and the implementation process is more likely to be monitored with diligence.<ref name=\"True, J., 2010, p. 199\">True, Jacqui (2010).

Mainstreaming essentially offers a pluralistic approach that values the diversity among people of different genders.\n\nThe concept of gender mainstreaming was first proposed at the 1985 Third World Conference on Women in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]]. The idea has been pushed in the [[United Nations]] development community. The idea was formally featured in 1995 at the [[Fourth World Conference on Women]] in [[Beijing]], [[China]], and was cited in the document that resulted from the conference, the [[Beijing Platform for Action]].\n\n== Definition ==\nMost definitions of gender mainstreaming conform to the UN [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]] formally defined concept:\n: Mainstreaming a gender perspective is the process of assessing the implications for women and men of any planned action, including legislation, policies or programmes, in all areas and at all levels. It is a strategy for making women's as well as men's concerns and experiences an integral dimension of the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes in all political, economic and societal spheres so that women and men benefit equally and inequality is not perpetuated. The ultimate goal is to achieve [[gender equality]].<ref>United Nations. \"[https://www.un.org/documents/ga/docs/52/plenary/a52-3.htm Report of the Economic and Social Council for 1997]\".

For example, ''liberal feminism'' is strongly invoked by mainstreaming through the binary approach of gender in strict relation to the public sphere of policymaking. ''Poststructuralist feminism'' can be seen in mainstreaming thought which seeks to displace gender difference as the sole axis of difference and to highlight the diversity of policy its ramifications.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Principles==\n[[File:Col.

This can be seen through the use of language, even as simply as in the UN Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration program's (DDR) motto: 'One man, on weapon'.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nReference of gender issues should be found in all [[policy]] areas. \"There must be evidence that the [[mainstream]] political agenda has been reoriented by rethinking and rearticulating [[policy]] ends and means from a gender perspective,\" Lombardo says, referencing [[Rounaq Jahan]], a political scientists, feminist leader and author.<ref name=\"Lombardo, E. 2005\">Lombardo, E., (2005) \"Integrating or Setting the Agenda?

Various feminist research has concluded that men and women experience violent conflict differently and moreover, the current policies surrounding PCPB are insufficient in addressing the disadvantaged position of women in male-dominated power structures that are further reinforced by peace-building efforts, both from the domestic and international communities. Gender mainstreaming in PCPB would emphasize the importance of gendered considerations of particular issues that disproportionally affect women in post-conflict settings. This would mean that policy reflected an acknowledgment of the many instances of wartime sexualized violence perpetrated on women, among other issues that (primarily) women face during conflict. A major focus of the effort towards gender mainstreaming in post-conflict peace-building policy is to lessen the international community's inclination towards building a return to 'normal' for the post-conflict region. Much of feminist research has found that returning to 'normal' is of little comfort for women, who were burdened by the patriarchal systems that were in place before conflict broke out. As Handrahan<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Handrahan|first=Lori|date=|title=Conflict, gender, ethnicity and post-conflict reconstruction|url=|journal=Security Dialogue|volume=35|pages=429\u2013445|via=University of Victoria library database}}</ref> notes, the international community involved in much of PCPB \"tolerates high levels of violence against women in their own societies.\" Policy that prioritized gender in its applications and goals would seek to build a society where women are better off than they were before conflict broke out.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Shifts in institutional culture===\n\nGender mainstreaming can be seen as a process of organizational change.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bibbings|first=Sharleene May|title=The politics of mainstreaming in critical perspective|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Pub.|location=Newcastle upon Tyne|isbn=9781443835121}}</ref> Gender mainstreaming must be institutionalized through concrete steps, mechanisms, and processes in all parts of the organization.<ref name=\"Charlesworth, H 2005\"/> According to Lombardo, this change involves three aspects: [[policy]] process, [[policy]] mechanisms; and [[policy]] actors. She explains as follows:\n\n\"1. A shift in [[policy]] process means that the process \"is reorganized so that ordinary actors know how to incorporate a gender perspective\" or that gender expertise is included \"as normal requirement for [[policy]]-makers\" (Council of Europe 1998, 165<ref>Council of Europe. 1998. Gender Mainstreaming: Conceptual Framework, Methodology and Presentation of Good Practices: Final Report of Activities of the Group of Specialists on Mainstreaming. EG-S-MS. Strasbourg: Council of Europe</ref>).\n\n2. A shift in [[policy]] mechanism involves (a) the adoption of horizontal cooperation on [[gender]] issues across all [[policy]] areas, levels, and departments; and (b) the use of appropriate [[policy]] tools and techniques to integrate the gender variable in all policies and to monitor and evaluate all policies from a [[gender]] perspective.\n\n3. The range of [[policy]] actors participating in the policy-making process is broadened to include, apart from policy-makers and civil servants, gender experts and civil society.\"<ref>Lombardo, E., (2005) \"Integrating or Setting the Agenda?

It can also be referred to as gender-sensitive budgeting or gender-responsive budgeting. Gender budgeting does not aim at creating separate budgets for women, or only increasing spending on women\u2019s programmes.

In 1993 the existing outdated Sandinista Women's organization, the Nicaraguan Institute for Research on Women, was revitalized and renamed by the Chamorro government as the Nicaraguan Institute for Woman (INIM).

The [[European Employment Strategy]] requires governments to adopt an approach that complies with the concept of gender mainstreaming, while deciding on employment policies.<ref name=\"Rubery, Jill 2005\">Rubery, Jill, 2005, Reflections on Gender Mainstreaming: An Example of Feminist Economics in Action?, Feminist Economics 11(3), November 2005, 1</ref><ref>Woodward, Alison E. 2008.

Taking stock in Brussels Journal of European Social Policy (2008) 18 (3): 4</ref> Some concrete examples: new equal opportunities acts requiring mainstreaming (e.g., in France social partners are required to promote gender equality through collective bargaining); mainstreaming or [[gender]] assessment in individual ministries or areas of public services (e.g., in Finland and Sweden); and [[gender]] assessment of all new pieces of legislation.<ref>Rubery, Jill, 2005, Reflections on Gender Mainstreaming: An Example of Feminist Economics in Action?, Feminist Economics 11(3), November 2005, 9-10</ref> According to Jill Rubery, a Professor of comparative employment system at Manchester School of Management, so far \"the experience has been mixed: though the argument that increasing women's employment is critical to the achievement of Europe's aspirations for a higher employment rate has been widely accepted, there is a much weaker and more fragile commitment to improving the quality of work available to women.\"<ref name=\"Rubery, Jill 2005\"/>\n\nA second example is the Transnational Women's Networks.<ref name=\"Lang, S. 2009\">Lang, S., 2009, Assessing Advocacy: European Transnational Women's Networks and Gender Mainstreaming, 12</ref> As such we can cite the [[European Women's Lobby]] (EWL) as an important women's organization at EU level that was created in 1990.

The EIGE has as mandate to \"provide expertise, improve knowledge and raise visibility of equality between men and women\".<ref name=\"Calvo 2013\"/>{{rp|53}}\n\nObviously there are many more initiatives on EU level, to name a few: Advisory Committee on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men,<ref name=\"Calvo 2013\"/>{{rp|57}} High Level Group on Gender Mainstreaming,<ref name=\"Calvo 2013\"/>{{rp|58}} Inter-Service Group on Gender Equality,<ref name=\"Calvo 2013\"/> Informal Group of Experts on Gender Equality in Development Cooperation,<ref name=\"Calvo 2013\"/>{{rp|61}} Women in Europe for our Common Future.<ref name=\"Lang, S. 2009\"/>\n\n==Criticism==\n\n===Ineffective results===\nMaria Stratigaki, Assistant Professor at the Department of Social Policy of [[Panteion University]], claims that the transformative effect of gender mainstreaming was minimal and its application has led to contradictory results. It opened important opportunities for specific policies in new [[policy]] areas, whereas in some other it diluted [[positive action]]. She also claims that, at least as of 2003, gender mainstreaming has failed to affect core [[policy]] areas or radically transform [[policy]] processes within the European Institutions.<ref name=\"Stratigaki, M 2005\">Stratigaki, M., (2005) \"Gender Mainstreaming vs Positive Action. An Ongoing Conflict in EU Gender Equality Policy\", ''European Journal of Women's Studies'' 12 (2): 165-186.</ref>\n\nSome say that gender mainstreaming has not increased women's participation in decision making. As Charlesworth notes, \"[i]n the most readily measurable area, the United Nations' employment of women in professional and managerial posts, progress has been glacial. In 2004, women held 37.4 percent of these positions. The annual growth rate toward the 50 percent target [...] is predicted to be 0.4 percent. On top of this slow growth, there is a considerable hierarchy based on sex. On June 30, 2004, women held 83.3 percent of positions at the lowest professional level, P-1, but just 16.7 percent at the highest staff level, Under-Secretary-General.\"<ref name=\"Charlesworth, H 2005\"/> In a similar vein, concerning the [[European Union]], Lombardo reports that as of 2003 women represented only 20 percent of the representatives of the head of state or government the member states, 10 percent of the representatives of national parliaments, 31.25 percent of the representatives of the [[European Parliament]] and so forth.<ref>Lombardo, E., (2005) \"Integrating or Setting the Agenda? Gender Mainstreaming in the European Constitution-Making Process\", Social Politics 12(3): 422</ref>\n\nTrue claims that mainstreaming gender does not end in simply increasing the number of women within a specific institution. It is about changing social consciousness, so that the effects of a policy for both women and men are truly analyzed before they are implemented. While it is necessary for [[feminists]] to engage with mainstream institutions, the ability of gender mainstreaming to deconstruct the embedded masculinization of institutions varies depending on the characteristics of the policy, the political nature of the institution, and the depth of the institution's consultation with civil society and other members of the women's rights movement.<ref>\"True, J. (2010) \"Mainstreaming Gender in International Relations\". ''Gender Matters in Global Politics'' (New York: Routledge) L.J. Shepherd (Ed.) 194\"</ref> The danger of gender mainstreaming is that large compromises can be made for small gains and can lead to what feminist and sociology professor Carol Dines calls \"trickle-down [[feminism]]\"\u2014i.e., \"working to increase the ranks of women in elite jobs without a strategy for wider economic and social change represents a kind of \"trickle-down [[feminism]].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/25/having-it-all-women-anne-marie-slaughter |title='Having it all' looks very different for women stuck in low-paid jobs &#124; Gail Dines &#124; Comment is free |publisher=theguardian.com |date=2014-04-23 |accessdate=2014-06-05}}</ref>\n\n===Poor implementation===\nCharlesworth remarks that \"[a]lthough it has not been difficult to encourage the adoption of the vocabulary of mainstreaming, there is little evidence of monitoring or follow-up. A consistent problem for all the organizations that adopted gender mainstreaming is the translation of the commitment into action.\"<ref name=\"Charlesworth, H 2005\"/> She continues: \"A review of gender mainstreaming policies implemented under the [[United Nations Development Programme]], [[World Bank]], and [[ILO]] found inadequate budgeting for the gender components of projects, insufficient development of analytical skills, poor supervision of the implementation of gender components and a general lack of political commitment both within the organization and at the country level.\"<ref name=\"Charlesworth, H 2005\"/>\n\n===Hindering progress===\nStratigaki claims that [[positive action]] was sidelined after the launch of gender mainstreaming as a result of the specific way gender mainstreaming was used by the opponents of [[gender equality]]. According to Stratigaki, \"[a]lmost all analyses of [gender mainstreaming] agree that it is a strategy which complements but does not replace previous gender specific equality policies like equal treatment legislation and positive action.\" However, she states too that \"in a hostile gender equality policy environments (i.e. patriarchal structures of institutional organisations or the prevalence of policy objectives contrary to gender equality etc.), [gender mainstreaming] may be conceived and applied as an alternative to positive action and used to downplay the final overall objective of [[gender equality]].<ref name=\"Stratigaki, M 2005\"/>\n\nTrue is of the opinion that in practice, attempts to mainstream gender within international institutions have led to the marginalization and increasing invisibility of gender in each policy area. Anne-Marie Goetz, a Clinical Professor at [[NYU]], and Joanne Sandler, a consultant for gender equality and organizational development, argue that ironically, mainstreaming gender runs the risk of becoming everyone's responsibility, yet nobody's at the same time.<ref name=\"True, J., 2010, p. 196\">True, Jacqui (2010). Laura J. Shepherd, ed. ''Gender Mainstreaming in International Institutions''. New York: Routledge. p. 196</ref> Gender mainstreaming can allow those in power who are not genuinely interested in the women's movement to adopt the language of women's rights, a reflection of power politics that becomes more of a tool used to legitimize the actions of governments. Gender mainstreaming then becomes more about advising governments than advancing gender equality.<ref name=\"True, J., 2010, p. 198\">True, Jacqui (2010). Laura J. Shepherd, ed. ''Mainstreaming Gender in International Institutions''. New York: Routledge. p. 198</ref>\n\n===Other criticism===\n\nAs differences are silenced, the kind of [[feminism]] that is likely to be mainstreamed could be a western or middle class brand of feminism. When mainstreaming decisions within international organizations are made by elites can undermine the input of local women's groups.<ref name=Palmary>{{cite journal|author1=Palmary, I.|author2=Nunez, L.|year=2009|title=The Orthodoxy of Gender Mainstreaming: Reflecting on Gender Mainstreaming as Strategy for Accomplishing the Millennium Development Goals|journal=Journal of Health Management|volume=11|issue=65|pages=65\u201378|doi=10.1177/097206340901100105}}</ref>{{rp|72}}\n\nWhen gender mainstreaming policies are drafted without consulting sections of the women's movement (i.e., women's rights civil society groups), they lack ground level-expertise. [[Policy]] decisions related to gender that are made without consulting sections of the women's movement do not demonstrate a clear political willingness to addressing gender inequality. When institutions reach out to the women's rights movement, it demonstrates transparency, inclusiveness, accountability and the implementation process is more likely to be monitored with diligence.<ref name=\"True, J., 2010, p. 199\">True, Jacqui (2010). Laura J. Shepherd, ed. Mainstreaming Gender in International Institutions. New York: Routledge. p. 192.</ref> For example, the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs), as an attempt at mainstreaming gender into development, were formed with minimal consultation with women's groups. The MDGs have led to a considerable amount of theoretically discourse about the goals but less analysis about how they will be implemented.<ref name=Palmary/>{{rp|78}}\n\nTrue highlights the tendency for gender mainstreaming to become a guise under which women are used as economic subjects.<ref name=\":1\" /> Women are framed in terms of advancing economic growth, as opposed to the inherent normative ideal for women and men to hold equal positions of power in society.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal bar|Feminism}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Feminist economics]]\n* [[Gender and security sector reform]]\n* [[Gender Empowerment Measure]]\n* [[Gender mainstreaming in teacher education policy]]\n* [[Gender mainstreaming in mine action]]\n* [[History of feminism]]\n* [[Material feminism]]\n* [[Special measures for gender equality in the United Nations]]\n* [[Youth mainstreaming]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://www.un.org/womenwatch WomenWatch], the United Nations Internet Gateway on Gender Equality and Empowerment of Women\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20091009065232/http://www.undp.org/women/ Women's Empowerment], the United Nations Development Programme's gateway on women's empowerment and gender equality\n*[http://brs.skl.se/brsbibl/kata_documents/doc39566_1.pdf Active work for Gender Equality]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, SALAR's booklet \"Active work for Gender Equality \u2013 a challenge for municipalities and county councils\"\"\n*[http://www.eige.europa.eu EIGE], the European Institute for Gender Equality official website\n*[http://www.genderCoP.eu The European Community of Practice on Gender Mainstreaming], The European Commission's learning network on Gender Mainstreaming within the European Social Fund (ESF)\"\"\n* [https://biblioguias.cepal.org/RegionalGenderAgenda/ Libguide on Gender Regional Agenda]\n\n{{Feminism}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gender Mainstreaming}}\n[[Category:Feminism and society]]\n[[Category:Feminist terminology]]\n[[Category:Women]]\n[[Category:Gender and society]]\n[[Category:Public policy]]\n", "name_user": "Astrophobe", "label": "safe", "comment": "+link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_mainstreaming"}

Jeff's first interest in bluegrass and country music came from seeing the [[Hee Haw]] television show that started in 1971. Jeff started to play guitar in high school and joined the high school bluegrass band The ''Suburban Grass''. The band played at schools, coffeehouses and then local bars. In college Jeff discovered his love for bluegrass from a dorm mate that played mandolin. Jeff's dorm mate introduced Jeff to [[Doc Watson]], a pioneer of bluegrass music. Jeff studied [[Dan Crary]], [[Norman Blake (American musician)|Norman Blake]], [[Don Reno]], [[Bill Monroe]], [[Lester Flatt]], [[Earl Scruggs]], [[Foggy Mountain Boys]] and [[The Stanley Brothers]]. After listing to and learning form the classics, Jeff studied the new bluegrass artists like [[Sam Bush]] and [[JD Crowe]]. The next band Jeff joined was The Johnsons. Jeff White and The Johnsons came in 1st place in the Best Bluegrass Band in America contest, put on by [[KFC]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] in 1979. Winning the contest earned them a free recording session in RCA's Nashville studio on [[Music row]]. Tom Collins, an album producer with Real Music City Records, helped them make two singles. In 1981 Jeff White and The Johnsons where named the Best New Bluegrass Band.

The railway originally formed as the '''Prince Edward County Railway''' in 1879, running between [[Picton, Ontario|Picton]] and Trenton, where it connected with the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] that ran between [[Montreal]] and [[Toronto]]. After being purchased by a group of investors and receiving a new charter to build northward, the railway renamed as the COR in 1882 and the company started building towards the gold fields at [[Madoc, Ontario|Eldorado]] and newly discovered iron fields in Coe Hill.\n\nOn reaching Coe Hill in 1884, the mine was found to have low grade ore, nearly bankrupting the company. Expansion continued to other mining areas around [[Bancroft, Ontario|Bancroft]], along with two wholly owned subsidiary lines, the '''Ontario, Belmont and Northern Railway''', later known as the '''Marmora Railway''', and the '''Bessemer and Barry's Bay Railway'''. The later was supposed to connect to the [[Ottawa, Arnprior and Parry Sound Railway]] (OA&PS) at [[Barry's Bay, Ontario|Barry's Bay]], but these plans were shelved. A new route to the OA&PS was selected to [[Whitney, Ontario|Whitney]], just outside [[Algonquin Provincial Park]]. Construction on this final portion reached [[Maynooth, Ontario|Maynooth]] in 1907 but was never completed, and the line ultimately ended in the now abandoned town of Wallace, about 25 kilometres south of Whitney.\n\nThe COR was taken over by [[William Mackenzie (railway entrepreneur)|Mackenzie]] and [[Donald Mann|Mann]] in 1910, along with the [[Irondale, Bancroft and Ottawa Railway]] which was connected to the COR north of Bancroft in July 1910. Both lines were then merged into their [[Canadian Northern Railway]] (CNoR) in 1911. After CNoR was nationalized 1918, the lines became part of the [[Canadian National Railways]] (CN) system in 1923. CN operated the COR as the '''Maynooth Subdivision'''. Sections of the line north of Maynooth were lifted in 1965, and the entire rest of the line in 1985. All of the side branches had been abandoned much earlier, typically when the ore deposits dried up.\n\nMuch of the route of the COR has been re-purposed as a multi-use recreational [[rail trail]], which has a variety of names depending on its location, with the '''Hastings Heritage Trail''' being a prominent part.\n\n==History==\n\n===Prince Edward County Railway===\n[[Prince Edward County, Ontario|Prince Edward County]] is a large peninsula on eastern [[Lake Ontario]]. It is roughly triangular in shape with its apex pointed to the east, and its connection to the mainland at the northwestern corner. It was first settled starting in 1784 by [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] after the [[American Revolutionary War]], and depended largely on fishing and barley in its early days.\n\nThe [[Grand Trunk Railway]] (GTR) reached [[Belleville, Ontario|Belleville]] on its way to Toronto in 1855, opening new markets to the County. Local businessmen began considering a railway to collect produce from across the peninsula and connecting with the GTR at Trenton, on the north side of the land bridge with the mainland.{{sfn|Brown|2011}} The Prince Edward County Railway company (PECR) was formed in 1873{{efn|Sources disagree on the date, some suggesting that it was formed in 1879 and opened in 1880, while others give 1873 as the formation and 1879 as the opening date.}} and began construction due west out of Picton towards the western shore of the peninsula, then turning northward for Trenton. Due to financial constraints, the line finally completed in 1879 and opened for service in October.{{sfn|Brown|2011}} In 1976 a large branch was wyed off west of Picton to serve large quarries north of town, near Elmbrook.\n\n===Expansion to Coe Hill===\nThe opening of [[Central Ontario]] during the 19th Century was driven primarily by the discovery of a number of mineral deposits, notably gold and iron ore. As mines grew, principally in the area of [[Marmora, Ontario|Marmora]] and [[Madoc, Ontario|Madoc]], a race formed between a series of railways companies who wanted to serve these markets. Among the many claimants were the [[Victoria Railway]] (VicR) that ran through [[Lindsay, Ontario|Lindsay]], a combined rail and water route by the [[Cobourg and Peterborough Railway]] (C&P), and a potential extension of the [[Toronto and Nipissing Railway]]. None of these were well placed though, as they ran towards Toronto instead of east to the major markets and shipping routes. The only line that appeared to be well positioned was a proposed branch of the [[Grand Junction Railway (Ontario)|Grand Junction Railway]] (GJR) out of Belleville. Since the new mining areas were directly north of both Trenton and Belleville, the PERC was also in an ideal location as a starting point.\n\nWilliam Coe of [[Madoc, Ontario|Madoc]] found [[iron ore]] deposits outside Brinklow and began looking for ways to commercialize the find. He contacted [[George William McMullen]], a railway promoter in [[Chicago]] who had been born and raised in Picton. McMullen started looking for partners, and found [[Samuel Ritchey]], a businessman from [[Ohio]] who was looking for new ventures. Rickey, McMullen and McMullen's brother J.B. bought the PECR in 1880 to serve as the basis for a rapid expansion. In 1881 the group purchased 70,000 acres of land for the mines, and transferred the deeds to the company.{{sfn|Bray}} The group then petitioned the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario|Ontario Legislature]] for the rights to rename the company and start construction northward, which was granted on 10 March 1882.{{sfn|Walker|2013}} The land deeds were transferred to the newly formed Coe Hill Mining Company, and the railway was renamed the Central Ontario Railway.{{sfn|Bray}}\n\nThe route was selected to take the line through several other mining areas, including Marmora, Deloro and Malone, before reaching Eldorado. The line reached Marmora in 1883 and the newly formed [[Wollaston, Ontario|Coe Hill]] in 1884.{{efn|Most sources agree this took place in 1884, either directly or by saying \"two years later\" after formation of the company in 1882. One source states Coe Hill was not reached until 1889, but this appears to be an error.}} The first load of ore left the station on 2 June 1884,{{sfn|Walker|2013}} but when the samples reached [[Cleveland]] for analysis the results showed that the ore was too low grade to be useful for mining, leaving the company on the verge of bankruptcy.{{sfn|Bray}}\n\n===Further routes and branches===\n[[File:Central Ontario Railway in Bancroft.jpg|thumb|A Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR) passenger train heads south out of Bancroft station in 1910.]]\n\nFrom that point the company turned to servicing other mines and sawmills in the area and constructed a number of branch lines. As early as May 1891, the '''Ontario, Belmont & Northern Railway''' (OB&NR), a wholly owned subsidiary of the COR, received a charter to build a branch line to the iron mines in the Marmora area. Construction did not start for some time, and the 14.5&nbsp;km line from Marmora Junction near Belmar to the Cordova mines was finally completed in July 1896. Later that year the branch was renamed to become the '''Marmora Railway & Mining Company'''.\n\nStarting in 1899 the mainline was extended further north, not from the original terminus in Coe Hill which became a branch line, but by via a wye off the line south of Brinklow and running almost due north from that point, roughly following the route of the modern [[Ontario Highway 62]]. The 19.55 mile extension to Bancroft opened on 2 November 1900.{{sfn|Walker|2013}} Another subsidiary line, the '''Bessemer and Barry's Bay Railway''', was chartered in 1904 (although apparently formed in the late 1800s) to branch off the COR at L'Amable, just south of Bancroft, and run eastward to connect to Bessemer and the Child's Mine. Later, plans were made to use this branch as the basis for an extension all the way to the  [[Ottawa, Arnprior and Parry Sound Railway]], at that time the busiest railway in Canada,<ref>\"Track and Tower\" brochure, Friends of Algonquin Park</ref> meeting it at [[Barry's Bay, Ontario|Barry's Bay]]. However, the extension plans were never taken up and the B&BB remained a spur ending Child's Mine.\n\nA connection with the OA&PS, by this time reorganized to become part of the [[Canadian Atlantic Railway]] (CAR), remained desirable. A new route running from the Bancroft  terminus was selected, running almost due north to meet the CAR near [[Whitney, Ontario|Whitney]], just outside today's [[Algonquin Provincial Park]]. Construction on this link reached Maynooth on 7 November 1907, Lake St. Peter in 1909, and Wallace in 1911<ref name=bob>[http://www.railwaybob.com/Constituents/CNoRConstituents.htm \"Central Ontario Railway\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140217020851/http://www.railwaybob.com/Constituents/CNoRConstituents.htm |date=February 17, 2014 }}, Railway Bob</ref> - so-named for the line's surveyor and chief engineer.{{sfn|Lyons|1986|loc=Chapter 7}} By this time the logging era had reached its peak and traffic was dwindling on the COR, and further expansion was abandoned, leaving the end of the line a turnaround-wye next to Joseph Lavalley's farm in Wallace.{{sfn|Lyons|1986|loc=Chapter 7}}\n\n===Leasing, purchase and abandonment===\n[[File:Maynooth Station 1971.jpg|thumb|By the time this photo was taken in 1971, the COR north of Maynooth had been abandoned and the section north of Bancroft was little used. Maynooth station is already in shabby condition.]]\n\nIn 1910 the entire COR was leased by the [[Irondale, Bancroft and Ottawa Railway]], which was itself purchased by the [[Canadian Northern Railway]] (CNoR) in 1911. The Canadian government took control of the CNoR in 1916, and folded its holdings into the forming [[Canadian National Railways]] (CNR) in 1918.<ref name=bob/> Under CN ownership, various sections were renamed as subdivisions; the line from Picton to Trenton became the '''Picton Subdivision''',<ref>[http://www.cnr-in-ontario.com/Subdivisions/Picton.html \"C.N.Rys. Picton Subdivision\"]</ref> the mainline to Maynooth became the '''Maynooth Subdivision''',<ref>[http://www.cnr-in-ontario.com/Subdivisions/Maynooth.html \"C.N.Rys. Maynooth Subdivision\"]</ref> while the various spurs became the '''Coe Hill Subdivision''',<ref>[http://www.cnr-in-ontario.com/Subdivisions/Coe_Hill.html \"C.N.Rys. Coe Hill Subdivision\"]</ref> the '''Marmora Subdivision''',<ref>[http://www.cnr-in-ontario.com/Subdivisions/Marmora.html \"C.N.Rys. Marmora Subdivision\"]</ref> and the '''Bessemer Subdivision'''.<ref>[http://www.cnr-in-ontario.com/Subdivisions/Bessemer.html \"C.N.Rys. Bessemer Subdivision\"]</ref>\n\nThe line was kept active by a series of small lumber mills that opened in the Lake McKenzie area. McConnell's Mill near the current intersection of McKenzie Lake Road and [[Ontario Highway 127]] was the first of these, and later taken over by the [[Rathburn Lumber|Rathbun Lumber Company]]. Judson Gunters opened a mill slightly to the north around 1918, which gives its name to maps to this day. The final mill in the area opened in 1943 when J.S.L. McRea moved his mill from Lake of Two Rivers in Algonquin to the area just north of Wallace. This mill operated until 1952.{{sfn|Lyons|1986|loc=Chapter 7}}\n\nWith the closing of the McRea mill and several other businesses in the area, traffic on the northern section of the line quickly dwindled. By 1955 all the business in Wallace had closed, and the COR ran a single train to the town every Wednesday to deliver mail. This section was abandoned in 1960, leaving the terminus at Lake St. Peter. On 22 April 1964 CNR applied to abandon the entire line from Wallace to Bird's Creek, just north of Bancroft where the COR met the Irondale (at today's \"Y\" Road). But only a smaller section, from Maynooth to Lake St. Peter was abandoned in 1965,{{sfn|Lyons|1986|loc=Chapter 7}} along with most of the spurs. The remainder of the line was abandoned by CNR in 1984, and the rails lifted either that year or the next. Today only a 1.5&nbsp;km long section of the line remains, used by [[CN Rail]] as a siding to service the grain terminal at Trenton junction.\n\n===Conversion to rail-trail===\n[[File:Northern end of the Central Ontario Railway.JPG|thumb|Looking south from the northernmost \"navigable\" point of the COR, at the ghost town of Gunters.]]\n[[File:Maynooth Ontario railway station.jpg|thumb|Maynooth Station on the COR, about 2 km east of the town of Maynooth, Ontario. The station was the northernmost major station on the Central Ontario Railway.]]\n\nMost of the COR, including the original PECR route, has been converted to rail-trail use. After its abandonment the line has increasingly been turned to local authorities for maintenance.\n\nThe route of the original PECR was purchased by Prince Edward County in 1997 and is now known as the [http://www.ontariotrails.on.ca/trails-a-z/millennium-trail-1 Millennium Trail], running for 49&nbsp;km out of Picton and ending just outside Trenton.<ref>[http://www.pecounty.on.ca/government/eng_dev_works/pdf/MilleniumTrailMap.pdf Map of the Millennium Trail] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826023249/http://pecounty.on.ca/government/eng_dev_works/pdf/MilleniumTrailMap.pdf |date=2014-08-26 }}.</ref>\n\nThe 17&nbsp;km section between [[Ontario Highway 401|the 401]] at Trenton and Glen Ross had been re-used for roadways and other uses, as well as being in a built-up area. The unused sections in this area only started conversion to trail use in the 2000s, and several of these sections opened in 2011. Just north of Trenton this is known as the Jack Lange Memorial Trail, and from there, from just south of {{Not a typo|Glen Miller}} to Glen Ross, it becomes the Lower Trent Trail.<ref>[http://www.friendsofthetrail.ca \"Welcome to the Lower Trent Trail\"]</ref>\n\nThe largest section of the trail network is the {{convert|156|km|adj=on}} long four-season [https://web.archive.org/web/20140515175353/http://www.hastingscounty.com/discovering-hastings/hastings-heritage-trail.html Hastings Heritage Trail], stretching from Glen Ross all the way to [[Lake St. Peter Provincial Park]] outside Maynooth.<ref>[http://www.ontariotrailmaps.ca/5G.page Map of the Hastings Heritage Trail]</ref> This is the official end of the line, where it hits the border between [[Hastings County]] and [[South Algonquin]]. The trail remains in good repair, signed and used, north of this border to its current ending point near [[McKenzie Lake (Madawaska River)|McKenzie Lake]], at the intersection of McKenzie Lake Road and McKenzie North Road, marked on many maps as the village of Gunters.<ref>[https://maps.google.ca/maps?q=gunters+ontario \"Gunters, Ontario\"], as it appears in Google Maps.</ref>\n\nThe short remaining section from Gunters to Wallace is used for a variety of purposes, including section of McKenzie Lake Road, [[Hydro One]] lines providing local service, and in some areas simply abandoned and heavily overgrown. The ultimate terminus can be seen a few meters to the west of McKenzie Lake Road at the [[ghost town]] of Wallace.\n\n==Route==\n[[File:Central Ontario Railway map 1910.pdf|thumb|This map, from the COR's June 1910 passenger timetable, shows the route running all the way to Whitney. It actually ended near the \"Y\" in \"RAILWAY\", in Sabine County.]]\nThe original Prince Edward County Railway ran almost due west out of Picton towards the western shore of the Prince Edward County peninsula. It turned northwest at [[Wellington, Ontario|Wellington]] and then due north at [[Hillier, Ontario|Hillier]] before turning northwest again at Consecon to loop around the western end of the [[Bay of Quinte]] and then northeast for the short remaining distance to Trenton. There were ten stations on the line, Picton, Bloomfield at 4.22 miles, Hallowell 7.59 miles, Wellington 10.97 miles, Niles' Corner 14.90 miles, Hillier 16.55 miles, Consecon 21.32 miles, [[Weller's Bay]] 25.64 miles, Canal 27.02 miles and Trenton 30.60 miles.<ref>[http://www.bellevillemodelrailroad.org/index.php/local-history/100-prince-edward-county-railway \"Prince Edward County Railway\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002074301/http://www.bellevillemodelrailroad.org/index.php/local-history/100-prince-edward-county-railway |date=October 2, 2013 }}</ref> This section of the line was abandoned in 1984 and the rails removed, but now the majority is used for a recreational trail. The original Picton Station is located on Main Street, and is occupied by C.F. Evans Lumber Company.\n\nFrom Trenton the line ran almost due north through Frankford, Glen Ross, Anson, Bonariaw, Marmora Station (just northeast of Marmora) and Deloror. Here it turned northeast toward Malone, and then east through Madoc to Eldorado. The line then turned north to run through Bannockburn, Millbridge Station and Gilmour, before turning west just south of Brinklow and running through Ormsby to its end just southwest of Coe Hill.\n\nThe Bancroft extension wyed off near Brinklow at Ormsby Junction, running north through Brinklow and detouring to the east en route to serve Detlor before reaching Bancroft. The next extension took it north from Bancroft to Maynooth Station (east of Maynooth). The original plans would have had it run roughly northeast along the route of [[Ontario Highway 62]] to [[Barry's Bay]], but instead took it northward along the route of [[Ontario Highway 127]] through [[Lake St. Peter Provincial Park]] before ultimately ending in the bush near McKenzie Lake.\n\nThere were two main spur lines. One split just south of Marmora at Belmar Station to run northwest to Cordova Mines, and the other split at Bessemer Junction near Detlor running east-northeast to Childs Mine.\n\nThe COR was joined by several other railways in the area. The [[Grand Junction Railway (Ontario)|Grand Junction Railway]] (GJR) ran between [[Peterborough, Ontario|Peterborough]] and Belleville and met the COR in a wye junction just outside the town of Anson, near [[Stirling, Ontario|Stirling]]. A branch of the GJR, the Belleville and North Hastings Railway (B&NH), later met the COR about 1&nbsp;km west of Eldorado. The [[Bay of Quinte Railway]] was extended to meet the COR just north of Eldorado at Bannockburn, reaching this point in 1902.<ref>[http://vishwawalking.ca/hastings-heritage-trail/hast-hertge-trl-of-2-lkes.html \"Trail of Two Lakes, Belleville and North Hastings Line\"]</ref><ref>[http://www.bellevillemodelrailroad.org/index.php/local-history/93-belleville-north-hastings \"Belleville and North Hastings Railway\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002041723/http://www.bellevillemodelrailroad.org/index.php/local-history/93-belleville-north-hastings |date=October 2, 2013 }}</ref> The final connection was to the [[Irondale, Bancroft and Ottawa Railway|Irondale, Bancroft and Ottawa]] which met the COR just north of Bancroft in 1910, meeting it at what it today known as \"Y\" Road, named for the wye intersection.\n\nMain stations on the line included Picton, Bloomfield, Wellington, Trenton, Frankford, Marmora, Coe Hill, Bancroft and Maynooth. Several stations have survived; the original Picton station was moved and became a private home, while the second station remains in use as a lumberyard. Hallowell was moved to Stanley Street in Bloomfield as a children's playhouse, Bloomfield moved to West Lake as a summer residence, Consecon is abandoned in place, Frankford moved to Stockdale as a restaurant, Marmora and Coe Hill both moved to a park to become information centres, Bancroft's station remains in place and is now a museum, Maynooth was abandoned in place (see image at top) and Lake St. Peter was moved to an unknown location.\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite web |first=Matt |last=Bray |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/ritchie_samuel_j_13E.html |title=Ritchie, Samuel J. |website=[[Dictionary of Canadian Biography]] |volume=XIII |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite web |first=Ron |last=Brown |url=http://countryroadshastings.ca/current-issue-s2.php?command=viewArticle&ID=7&currentFeed=3 |title=The ghost rail lines of Hastings County |website=Country Roads |date=17 June 2011 |ref=harv |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130624023930/http://countryroadshastings.ca/current-issue-s2.php?command=viewArticle&ID=7&currentFeed=3 |archivedate=24 June 2013 }}\n* {{cite web |first=Jim |last=Walker |url=http://blog.harveyhistoricalsociety.ca/canadian-railways/ |title=Canadian Railways |website=Harvey Historical Society |date=1 February 2013 |ref=harv |access-date=4 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000358/http://blog.harveyhistoricalsociety.ca/canadian-railways/ |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}\n* {{cite book |last=Lyons |first=Bob |title=Whitney: Island in the Shield |publisher=Bancroft Times |year=1986 |ref=harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.flickr.com/photos/castelmar/105663683/ This image] is a marked up version of the map in the 1910 timetable, highlighting nearby railways.

The railway originally formed as the '''Prince Edward County Railway''' in 1879, running between [[Picton, Ontario|Picton]] and Trenton, where it connected with the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] that ran between [[Montreal]] and [[Toronto]]. After being purchased by a group of investors and receiving a new charter to build northward, the railway renamed as the COR in 1882 and the company started building towards the gold fields at [[Madoc, Ontario|Eldorado]] and newly discovered iron fields in Coe Hill.\n\nOn reaching Coe Hill in 1884, the mine was found to have low grade ore, nearly bankrupting the company. Expansion continued to other mining areas around [[Bancroft, Ontario|Bancroft]], along with two wholly owned subsidiary lines, the '''Ontario, Belmont and Northern Railway''', later known as the '''Marmora Railway''', and the '''Bessemer and Barry's Bay Railway'''. The later was supposed to connect to the [[Ottawa, Arnprior and Parry Sound Railway]] (OA&PS) at [[Barry's Bay, Ontario|Barry's Bay]], but these plans were shelved. A new route to the OA&PS was selected to [[Whitney, Ontario|Whitney]], just outside [[Algonquin Provincial Park]]. Construction on this final portion reached [[Maynooth, Ontario|Maynooth]] in 1907 but was never completed, and the line ultimately ended in the now abandoned town of Wallace, about 25 kilometres south of Whitney.\n\nThe COR was taken over by [[William Mackenzie (railway entrepreneur)|Mackenzie]] and [[Donald Mann|Mann]] in 1910, along with the [[Irondale, Bancroft and Ottawa Railway]] which was connected to the COR north of Bancroft in July 1910. Both lines were then merged into their [[Canadian Northern Railway]] (CNoR) in 1911. After CNoR was nationalized 1918, the lines became part of the [[Canadian National Railways]] (CN) system in 1923. CN operated the COR as the '''Maynooth Subdivision'''. Sections of the line north of Maynooth were lifted in 1965, and the entire rest of the line in 1985. All of the side branches had been abandoned much earlier, typically when the ore deposits dried up.\n\nMuch of the route of the COR has been re-purposed as a multi-use recreational [[rail trail]], which has a variety of names depending on its location, with the '''Hastings Heritage Trail''' being a prominent part.\n\n==History==\n\n===Prince Edward County Railway===\n[[Prince Edward County, Ontario|Prince Edward County]] is a large peninsula on eastern [[Lake Ontario]]. It is roughly triangular in shape with its apex pointed to the east, and its connection to the mainland at the northwestern corner. It was first settled starting in 1784 by [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] after the [[American Revolutionary War]], and depended largely on fishing and barley in its early days.\n\nThe [[Grand Trunk Railway]] (GTR) reached [[Belleville, Ontario|Belleville]] on its way to Toronto in 1855, opening new markets to the County. Local businessmen began considering a railway to collect produce from across the peninsula and connecting with the GTR at Trenton, on the north side of the land bridge with the mainland.{{sfn|Brown|2011}} The Prince Edward County Railway company (PECR) was formed in 1873{{efn|Sources disagree on the date, some suggesting that it was formed in 1879 and opened in 1880, while others give 1873 as the formation and 1879 as the opening date.}} and began construction due west out of Picton towards the western shore of the peninsula, then turning northward for Trenton. Due to financial constraints, the line finally completed in 1879 and opened for service in October.{{sfn|Brown|2011}} In 1976 a large branch was wyed off west of Picton to serve large quarries north of town, near Elmbrook.\n\n===Expansion to Coe Hill===\nThe opening of [[Central Ontario]] during the 19th Century was driven primarily by the discovery of a number of mineral deposits, notably gold and iron ore. As mines grew, principally in the area of [[Marmora, Ontario|Marmora]] and [[Madoc, Ontario|Madoc]], a race formed between a series of railways companies who wanted to serve these markets. Among the many claimants were the [[Victoria Railway]] (VicR) that ran through [[Lindsay, Ontario|Lindsay]], a combined rail and water route by the [[Cobourg and Peterborough Railway]] (C&P), and a potential extension of the [[Toronto and Nipissing Railway]]. None of these were well placed though, as they ran towards Toronto instead of east to the major markets and shipping routes. The only line that appeared to be well positioned was a proposed branch of the [[Grand Junction Railway (Ontario)|Grand Junction Railway]] (GJR) out of Belleville. Since the new mining areas were directly north of both Trenton and Belleville, the PERC was also in an ideal location as a starting point.\n\nWilliam Coe of [[Madoc, Ontario|Madoc]] found [[iron ore]] deposits outside Brinklow and began looking for ways to commercialize the find. He contacted [[George William McMullen]], a railway promoter in [[Chicago]] who had been born and raised in Picton. McMullen started looking for partners, and found [[Samuel Ritchey]], a businessman from [[Ohio]] who was looking for new ventures. Rickey, McMullen and McMullen's brother J.B. bought the PECR in 1880 to serve as the basis for a rapid expansion. In 1881 the group purchased 70,000 acres of land for the mines, and transferred the deeds to the company.{{sfn|Bray}} The group then petitioned the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario|Ontario Legislature]] for the rights to rename the company and start construction northward, which was granted on 10 March 1882.{{sfn|Walker|2013}} The land deeds were transferred to the newly formed Coe Hill Mining Company, and the railway was renamed the Central Ontario Railway.{{sfn|Bray}}\n\nThe route was selected to take the line through several other mining areas, including Marmora, Deloro and Malone, before reaching Eldorado. The line reached Marmora in 1883 and the newly formed [[Wollaston, Ontario|Coe Hill]] in 1884.{{efn|Most sources agree this took place in 1884, either directly or by saying \"two years later\" after formation of the company in 1882. One source states Coe Hill was not reached until 1889, but this appears to be an error.}} The first load of ore left the station on 2 June 1884,{{sfn|Walker|2013}} but when the samples reached [[Cleveland]] for analysis the results showed that the ore was too low grade to be useful for mining, leaving the company on the verge of bankruptcy.{{sfn|Bray}}\n\n===Further routes and branches===\n[[File:Central Ontario Railway in Bancroft.jpg|thumb|A Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR) passenger train heads south out of Bancroft station in 1910.]]\n\nFrom that point the company turned to servicing other mines and sawmills in the area and constructed a number of branch lines. As early as May 1891, the '''Ontario, Belmont & Northern Railway''' (OB&NR), a wholly owned subsidiary of the COR, received a charter to build a branch line to the iron mines in the Marmora area. Construction did not start for some time, and the 14.5&nbsp;km line from Marmora Junction near Belmar to the Cordova mines was finally completed in July 1896. Later that year the branch was renamed to become the '''Marmora Railway & Mining Company'''.\n\nStarting in 1899 the mainline was extended further north, not from the original terminus in Coe Hill which became a branch line, but by via a wye off the line south of Brinklow and running almost due north from that point, roughly following the route of the modern [[Ontario Highway 62]]. The 19.55 mile extension to Bancroft opened on 2 November 1900.{{sfn|Walker|2013}} Another subsidiary line, the '''Bessemer and Barry's Bay Railway''', was chartered in 1904 (although apparently formed in the late 1800s) to branch off the COR at L'Amable, just south of Bancroft, and run eastward to connect to Bessemer and the Child's Mine. Later, plans were made to use this branch as the basis for an extension all the way to the  [[Ottawa, Arnprior and Parry Sound Railway]], at that time the busiest railway in Canada,<ref>\"Track and Tower\" brochure, Friends of Algonquin Park</ref> meeting it at [[Barry's Bay, Ontario|Barry's Bay]]. However, the extension plans were never taken up and the B&BB remained a spur ending Child's Mine.\n\nA connection with the OA&PS, by this time reorganized to become part of the [[Canadian Atlantic Railway]] (CAR), remained desirable. A new route running from the Bancroft  terminus was selected, running almost due north to meet the CAR near [[Whitney, Ontario|Whitney]], just outside today's [[Algonquin Provincial Park]]. Construction on this link reached Maynooth on 7 November 1907, Lake St. Peter in 1909, and Wallace in 1911<ref name=bob>[http://www.railwaybob.com/Constituents/CNoRConstituents.htm \"Central Ontario Railway\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140217020851/http://www.railwaybob.com/Constituents/CNoRConstituents.htm |date=February 17, 2014 }}, Railway Bob</ref> - so-named for the line's surveyor and chief engineer.{{sfn|Lyons|1986|loc=Chapter 7}} By this time the logging era had reached its peak and traffic was dwindling on the COR, and further expansion was abandoned, leaving the end of the line a turnaround-wye next to Joseph Lavalley's farm in Wallace.{{sfn|Lyons|1986|loc=Chapter 7}}\n\n===Leasing, purchase and abandonment===\n[[File:Maynooth Station 1971.jpg|thumb|By the time this photo was taken in 1971, the COR north of Maynooth had been abandoned and the section north of Bancroft was little used. Maynooth station is already in shabby condition.]]\n\nIn 1910 the entire COR was leased by the [[Irondale, Bancroft and Ottawa Railway]], which was itself purchased by the [[Canadian Northern Railway]] (CNoR) in 1911. The Canadian government took control of the CNoR in 1916, and folded its holdings into the forming [[Canadian National Railways]] (CNR) in 1918.<ref name=bob/> Under CN ownership, various sections were renamed as subdivisions; the line from Picton to Trenton became the '''Picton Subdivision''',<ref>[http://www.cnr-in-ontario.com/Subdivisions/Picton.html \"C.N.Rys. Picton Subdivision\"]</ref> the mainline to Maynooth became the '''Maynooth Subdivision''',<ref>[http://www.cnr-in-ontario.com/Subdivisions/Maynooth.html \"C.N.Rys. Maynooth Subdivision\"]</ref> while the various spurs became the '''Coe Hill Subdivision''',<ref>[http://www.cnr-in-ontario.com/Subdivisions/Coe_Hill.html \"C.N.Rys.

Marmora Subdivision\"]</ref> and the '''Bessemer Subdivision'''.<ref>[http://www.cnr-in-ontario.com/Subdivisions/Bessemer.html \"C.N.Rys. Bessemer Subdivision\"]</ref>\n\nThe line was kept active by a series of small lumber mills that opened in the Lake McKenzie area. McConnell's Mill near the current intersection of McKenzie Lake Road and [[Ontario Highway 127]] was the first of these, and later taken over by the [[Rathburn Lumber|Rathbun Lumber Company]]. Judson Gunters opened a mill slightly to the north around 1918, which gives its name to maps to this day. The final mill in the area opened in 1943 when J.S.L. McRea moved his mill from Lake of Two Rivers in Algonquin to the area just north of Wallace. This mill operated until 1952.{{sfn|Lyons|1986|loc=Chapter 7}}\n\nWith the closing of the McRea mill and several other businesses in the area, traffic on the northern section of the line quickly dwindled. By 1955 all the business in Wallace had closed, and the COR ran a single train to the town every Wednesday to deliver mail. This section was abandoned in 1960, leaving the terminus at Lake St. Peter. On 22 April 1964 CNR applied to abandon the entire line from Wallace to Bird's Creek, just north of Bancroft where the COR met the Irondale (at today's \"Y\" Road). But only a smaller section, from Maynooth to Lake St. Peter was abandoned in 1965,{{sfn|Lyons|1986|loc=Chapter 7}} along with most of the spurs. The remainder of the line was abandoned by CNR in 1984, and the rails lifted either that year or the next. Today only a 1.5&nbsp;km long section of the line remains, used by [[CN Rail]] as a siding to service the grain terminal at Trenton junction.\n\n===Conversion to rail-trail===\n[[File:Northern end of the Central Ontario Railway.JPG|thumb|Looking south from the northernmost \"navigable\" point of the COR, at the ghost town of Gunters.]]\n[[File:Maynooth Ontario railway station.jpg|thumb|Maynooth Station on the COR, about 2 km east of the town of Maynooth, Ontario. The station was the northernmost major station on the Central Ontario Railway.]]\n\nMost of the COR, including the original PECR route, has been converted to rail-trail use. After its abandonment the line has increasingly been turned to local authorities for maintenance.\n\nThe route of the original PECR was purchased by Prince Edward County in 1997 and is now known as the [http://www.ontariotrails.on.ca/trails-a-z/millennium-trail-1 Millennium Trail], running for 49&nbsp;km out of Picton and ending just outside Trenton.<ref>[http://www.pecounty.on.ca/government/eng_dev_works/pdf/MilleniumTrailMap.pdf Map of the Millennium Trail] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826023249/http://pecounty.on.ca/government/eng_dev_works/pdf/MilleniumTrailMap.pdf |date=2014-08-26 }}.</ref>\n\nThe 17&nbsp;km section between [[Ontario Highway 401|the 401]] at Trenton and Glen Ross had been re-used for roadways and other uses, as well as being in a built-up area. The unused sections in this area only started conversion to trail use in the 2000s, and several of these sections opened in 2011. Just north of Trenton this is known as the Jack Lange Memorial Trail, and from there, from just south of {{Not a typo|Glen Miller}} to Glen Ross, it becomes the Lower Trent Trail.<ref>[http://www.friendsofthetrail.ca \"Welcome to the Lower Trent Trail\"]</ref>\n\nThe largest section of the trail network is the 156&nbsp;km long four-season [https://web.archive.org/web/20140515175353/http://www.hastingscounty.com/discovering-hastings/hastings-heritage-trail.html Hastings Heritage Trail], stretching from Glen Ross all the way to [[Lake St. Peter Provincial Park]] outside Maynooth.<ref>[http://www.ontariotrailmaps.ca/5G.page Map of the Hastings Heritage Trail]</ref> This is the official end of the line, where it hits the border between [[Hastings County]] and [[South Algonquin]]. The trail remains in good repair, signed and used, north of this border to its current ending point near [[McKenzie Lake (Moore Creek)|McKenzie Lake]], at the intersection of McKenzie Lake Road and McKenzie Lake North, marked on many maps as the village of Gunters.<ref>[https://maps.google.ca/maps?q=gunters+ontario \"Gunters, Ontario\"], as it appears in Google Maps.</ref>\n\nThe short remaining section from Gunters to Wallace is used for a variety of purposes, including section of McKenzie Lake Road, [[Hydro One]] lines providing local service, and in some areas simply abandoned and heavily overgrown. The ultimate terminus can be seen a few meters to the west of McKenzie Lake Road at the [[ghost town]] of Wallace.\n\n==Route==\n[[File:Central Ontario Railway map 1910.pdf|thumb|This map, from the COR's June 1910 passenger timetable, shows the route running all the way to Whitney. It actually ended near the \"Y\" in \"RAILWAY\", in Sabine County.]]\nThe original Prince Edward County Railway ran almost due west out of Picton towards the western shore of the Prince Edward County peninsula. It turned northwest at [[Wellington, Ontario|Wellington]] and then due north at [[Hillier, Ontario|Hillier]] before turning northwest again at Consecon to loop around the western end of the [[Bay of Quinte]] and then northeast for the short remaining distance to Trenton. There were ten stations on the line, Picton, Bloomfield at 4.22 miles, Hallowell 7.59 miles, Wellington 10.97 miles, Niles' Corner 14.90 miles, Hillier 16.55 miles, Consecon 21.32 miles, [[Weller's Bay]] 25.64 miles, Canal 27.02 miles and Trenton 30.60 miles.<ref>[http://www.bellevillemodelrailroad.org/index.php/local-history/100-prince-edward-county-railway \"Prince Edward County Railway\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002074301/http://www.bellevillemodelrailroad.org/index.php/local-history/100-prince-edward-county-railway |date=October 2, 2013 }}</ref> This section of the line was abandoned in 1984 and the rails removed, but now the majority is used for a recreational trail. The original Picton Station is located on Main Street, and is occupied by C.F. Evans Lumber Company.\n\nFrom Trenton the line ran almost due north through Frankford, Glen Ross, Anson, Bonariaw, Marmora Station (just northeast of Marmora) and Deloror. Here it turned northeast toward Malone, and then east through Madoc to Eldorado. The line then turned north to run through Bannockburn, Millbridge Station and Gilmour, before turning west just south of Brinklow and running through Ormsby to its end just southwest of Coe Hill.\n\nThe Bancroft extension wyed off near Brinklow at Ormsby Junction, running north through Brinklow and detouring to the east en route to serve Detlor before reaching Bancroft. The next extension took it north from Bancroft to Maynooth Station (east of Maynooth). The original plans would have had it run roughly northeast along the route of [[Ontario Highway 62]] to [[Barry's Bay]], but instead took it northward along the route of [[Ontario Highway 127]] through [[Lake St. Peter Provincial Park]] before ultimately ending in the bush near McKenzie Lake.\n\nThere were two main spur lines. One split just south of Marmora at Belmar Station to run northwest to Cordova Mines, and the other split at Bessemer Junction near Detlor running east-northeast to Childs Mine.\n\nThe COR was joined by several other railways in the area. The [[Grand Junction Railway (Ontario)|Grand Junction Railway]] (GJR) ran between [[Peterborough, Ontario|Peterborough]] and Belleville and met the COR in a wye junction just outside the town of Anson, near [[Stirling, Ontario|Stirling]]. A branch of the GJR, the Belleville and North Hastings Railway (B&NH), later met the COR about 1&nbsp;km west of Eldorado. The [[Bay of Quinte Railway]] was extended to meet the COR just north of Eldorado at Bannockburn, reaching this point in 1902.<ref>[http://vishwawalking.ca/hastings-heritage-trail/hast-hertge-trl-of-2-lkes.html \"Trail of Two Lakes, Belleville and North Hastings Line\"]</ref><ref>[http://www.bellevillemodelrailroad.org/index.php/local-history/93-belleville-north-hastings \"Belleville and North Hastings Railway\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002041723/http://www.bellevillemodelrailroad.org/index.php/local-history/93-belleville-north-hastings |date=October 2, 2013 }}</ref> The final connection was to the [[Irondale, Bancroft and Ottawa Railway|Irondale, Bancroft and Ottawa]] which met the COR just north of Bancroft in 1910, meeting it at what it today known as \"Y\" Road, named for the wye intersection.\n\nMain stations on the line included Picton, Bloomfield, Wellington, Trenton, Frankford, Marmora, Coe Hill, Bancroft and Maynooth. Several stations have survived; the original Picton station was moved and became a private home, while the second station remains in use as a lumberyard. Hallowell was moved to Stanley Street in Bloomfield as a children's playhouse, Bloomfield moved to West Lake as a summer residence, Consecon is abandoned in place, Frankford moved to Stockdale as a restaurant, Marmora and Coe Hill both moved to a park to become information centres, Bancroft's station remains in place and is now a museum, Maynooth was abandoned in place (see image at top) and Lake St. Peter was moved to an unknown location.\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite web |first=Matt |last=Bray |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/ritchie_samuel_j_13E.html |title=Ritchie, Samuel J. |website=[[Dictionary of Canadian Biography]] |volume=XIII |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite web |first=Ron |last=Brown |url=http://countryroadshastings.ca/current-issue-s2.php?command=viewArticle&ID=7&currentFeed=3 |title=The ghost rail lines of Hastings County |website=Country Roads |date=17 June 2011 |ref=harv |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130624023930/http://countryroadshastings.ca/current-issue-s2.php?command=viewArticle&ID=7&currentFeed=3 |archivedate=24 June 2013 }}\n* {{cite web |first=Jim |last=Walker |url=http://blog.harveyhistoricalsociety.ca/canadian-railways/ |title=Canadian Railways |website=Harvey Historical Society |date=1 February 2013 |ref=harv |access-date=4 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000358/http://blog.harveyhistoricalsociety.ca/canadian-railways/ |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}\n* {{cite book |last=Lyons |first=Bob |title=Whitney: Island in the Shield |publisher=Bancroft Times |year=1986 |ref=harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.flickr.com/photos/castelmar/105663683/ This image] is a marked up version of the map in the 1910 timetable, highlighting nearby railways.
