{"title_page": "College rivalry", "text_new": "{{original research|date=March 2013}}\n[[File:Japan National Stadium 200111b20.jpg|thumb|300px|The rugby game Classic [[Meiji University]] versus [[Waseda University]] at 56th [[All-Japan University Rugby Championship]] - Final ([[Japan National Stadium (2019)|Japan National Stadium]])]]\nPairs of schools, [[college]]s and [[universities]], especially when they are close to each other either geographically or in their areas of specialization, often establish a '''college rivalry''' with each other over the years. This [[List of sports rivalries|rivalry]] can extend to both [[academia|academics]] and [[College athletics|athletics]], the latter being typically better known to the general public. These schools place an added emphasis on emerging victorious in any event that includes their rival. This may include the creation of a special trophy or other commemoration of the event. While many of these rivalries have arisen spontaneously, some have been created by college officials in efforts to sell more tickets and support their programs.\n\n==Definition of a sports rivalry==\nRivalries traverse many different fields within society. A rivalry develops from the product of competition and ritualism between different parties. A rivalry is defined as \"a perceptual categorizing process in which actors identify which states are sufficiently threatening competitors\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=William|title=Identifying Rivals and Rivalries in World Politics|journal=International Studies Quarterly|year=2001|volume=45|pages=557|doi=10.1111/0020-8833.00214}}</ref> Ritualism is \"a series of ... iterated acts or performances that are ... famous in terms 'not entirely encoded by the performer'; that is, they are imbued by meanings external to the performer\".<ref name=\"Seligman\">{{cite journal|last=Seligman|first=Adam B. |title=Ritual, the Self, and Sincerity|journal=Social Research: An International Quarterly|volume = 76 | issue = 4| date = Winter 2009|pages = 1073\u20131096|publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/527713/pdf}}</ref> Everyone that is part of the sports event in some capacity becomes a part of the ritualism. Teams get together before the game to warm up, coaches shake hands with each other, captains have a determinant of who gets the ball first, everyone stands during the national anthem, the fans sit in specific areas, they make certain gestures with their hands throughout the game, they wear specific gear that is associated with the team, and they have the same post-game practices every game of every season of every year.<ref name=\"Clotfelter 2011 72\">{{cite book|last=Clotfelter|first=Charles|title=Big-Time Sports in American Universities|year=2011|pages=72}}</ref> It is through this consistency of playing the same teams yearly that \"these rivalries have shown remarkable staying power\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Clotfelter|first=Charles|title=Big-Time Sports in American Universities|year=2011|pages=49\u201350}}</ref> Specifically, it is society's drive to disrupt these original rituals that start rivalries. [[Horst Helle]] says, \"society needs a particular quantitative relationship of harmony and disharmony, association and competition, favour and disfavour, in order to take shape in a specific way\".<ref name=\"Seligman\"/> Society is drawn to this in sports because this is a principal characteristic in everyday life, which can be seen in historic religious rivalries, such as the contemporary example of sectarianism in Glasgow. Within an area, differences between two types of people can drive the start of a rivalry. Competition and support keep the rivalry going.\n\nIn sports, competition tests who has better skill and ability at the time of the game through play. Many rivalries persist because the competition is between two teams that have similar abilities. Spectators gravitate towards competitive rivalries because they are interesting to watch and unpredictable. Society follows competitions because competitions influence \"the unity of society\".<ref name=\"Helle 2008 949\">{{cite journal|last=Helle|first=Horst|title=Soziologie Der Konkurrenz \u2013 Sociology of Competition by Georg Simmel|journal=Canadian Journal of Sociology|year=2008|volume=33|series=4|pages=949}}</ref> Being loyal to one team in a rivalry brings a sense of belonging to a community of supporters that are hoping that the team they are rooting for wins. The fans of the two different teams do not sit next to each other because this disrupts the community. In a similar way, competition displays an indirect way of fighting.<ref name=\"Helle 2008 949\"/> Society does not condone direct fighting as a way of getting something so this is the most passive aggressive way of fighting. Because this is an acceptable practice, there are many supporters of competition as they fuel a way for the people to participate in a rivalry without the consequences of fighting. However, when the competition is not enough in sports and the tensions are high fighting does ensue.\n\n==Important contributors that fuel a rivalry==\nAn important precursor to having a rivalry is having intense competitive play between two sports teams within the ritualistic structure of the game. A competition is \"a form of struggle fought by means of objective performances, to the advantage of a third [party]\",<ref>{{cite journal|last=Helle|first=Horst|title=Soziologie Der Konkurrenz \u2013 Sociology of Competition by Georg Simmel|journal=Canadian Journal of Sociology|year=2008|volume=33|series=4|pages=946}}</ref> which in sports is driven by the team dynamic, and external outlets such as the fans and the media. These external outlets give rivalries more distinctive importance. An example of a rivalry that embodies this is the [[Yankees\u2013Red Sox rivalry]].\n\n===The team dynamic===\nIn such sports as basketball and football there is a stress on the importance of teamwork. This is so because the team is a smaller society that needs to function properly. This means that they need good communication and get necessary goals accomplished for the team. Because of this, the individual on the team is seen as less important than the group as everyone works toward the goal of making the group the best it can possibly be. Players do this \"in the form of obedience to authority, group loyalty, and the willingness to sacrifice for the good of the group.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Coakley|first=Jay|title=Sports in Society|year=2004|pages=435}}</ref>\n\n===The spectators===\nThe spectators, also known as fans, of sporting events are the largest population associated with the event. Fans exhibit \"intangible feelings of pride, solidarity, and pleasure\" for a particular team<ref>{{cite book|last=Clotfelter|first=Charles|title=Big-Time Sports in American Universities|year=2011|pages=200}}</ref> and brand loyalty, which means that they \"heavily identify[y] with a particular team or university and have shown that the self-esteem of these ardent fans can be affected by their team's success in competition\".<ref name=\"Clotfelter 2011 72\"/> This is important in rivalries because fans can determine the outcome of the game and the overall mood throughout the game. The fans have a lot of power because of this fact and therefore possess indirect power and determination on the outcome of the game.\n\n===The media===\nThe media connect the team, with the fans and the rest of the world. \"The media do[es not] 'tell it like it is.' Rather, they tell it in a way that supports the interests of those who benefit from cultural commitments to competition, productivity, and material success.\"<ref name=\"Coakley 2004 428\">{{cite book|last=Coakley|first=Jay|title=Sports in Society|year=2004|pages=428}}</ref> This is known as consumerism because the media influences society's emotions to think of the rivalries in a way that will get people to be as passionate about the game as they want to be. It is spectators' enjoyment of sports and the associated rivalries that drive media sport consumption.<ref name=\"Coakley 2004 428\"/>\n\nFans become constitutively invested in a team, commercial enterprises find ways to make money off them, the media covers analysis of the rivalry, and the teams become emotionally invested, leading to tensions between the teams.\n\n==Australia==\n\n*'''[[Prince Alfred College]]''' and '''[[St Peter's College, Adelaide|Saint Peter's College]]'''\nEach sport has an annual intercollegiate showdown between the two prestigious schools, known as the \"Intercol\". These are considered by the two colleges to be the most important games of the season, and the fiercely fought matches draw big crowds of students and old scholars from both schools. The Intercols have been played for over 100 years. The Cricket Intercollegiate match has been competed in since 1878. According to Richard Sproull this is \"the oldest unbroken annual contest in the history of cricket\" (Weekend Australian 5/6 December 1992). For the sport of rowing, the intercol is competed during South Australia's 'Head of the River Regatta', on the second to last Saturday of the first school term, with one of the two school's taking out the statewide title nearly every year since its beginning. \n*'''[[Nudgee College]]''' and '''[[Gregory Terrace (school)|Gregory Terrace]]'''\nIn 1991, the following legend was printed in the Centennial Rugby Programme, dubbed \u2013 \"The Battle of The Colours\", for the 100th anniversary of the annual Nudgee vs Terrace rugby match. The legend has it that the two St Joseph's, who both wore the Christian Brothers traditional Blue and White, played off in a Rugby game to decide who would keep the prestigious colours. As the story goes Nudgee won the match seeing them keep the colours with Gregory Terrace changing to the now famed Red and Black. This fierce rivalry has continued ever since in every sport yet Rugby continues to stand head and shoulders above the rest, with crowds of up to 10 000 attending First XV fixtures. As two of the biggest Rugby schools in Australia the schools also compete for the St Joseph's Cup. \n*'''[[Jane Franklin Hall]]''', '''[[St. John Fisher College (University of Tasmania)|John Fisher College]]''' and [[Christ College (University of Tasmania)|'''Christ College''']]\nIntercollege Sport has been played between Jane Franklin Hall, Christ College and St. John Fisher College for many years, with many sports played, most importantly Rugby, Cricket and Australian Rules football. These matches are fiercely contested, indeed playing a part in the winning Rugby side is considered the crowning achievement in ones time at college. Jane Franklin Hall has had the edge in sporting prowess over the years in most sports \u2013 with its winning streak in Soccer extending back to the mid 1980s, for example \u2013 apart from Rugby which is very tightly contested, with Christ College coming out the victor more often over recent years. Each year, the colleges compete for the Intercollege Cup, which is decided based on points earned from sporting results. Each sport is allocated various points for first, second and third, and weighted to reward the college that wins the more prestigious sports of Rugby, Football and Cricket, with Rugby given the highest weighting.\n\n==Belgium==\n*'''[[Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain]]''' and '''[[Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles]]'''.\n*'''[[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]]''' and '''[[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]]'''.\nRivalry started in the 1830s when the [[Free University of Brussels (1834\u20131969)|Free University of Brussels]] was established as a [[non-religious]] and [[freethinking]] university whereas the old [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834\u20131968)|Catholic University of Leuven]] \u2013 refounded in 1835 \u2013 remained under Church control. The rivalry survived the division of the two original foundations into separate Dutch-speaking and French-speaking establishments, in 1968 and 1970 respectively. Nowadays control of the Church over the two catholic universities has diminished and they are largely pluralist, accepting students and professors from all religions and backgrounds, but the rivalry with the two secular universities in Brussels continues. This rivalry finds expression mainly among academics and traditional student activities as intercollegiate sports remain largely developed in Belgium.\n\n==Canada==\n*'''[[Carleton University]]''' and '''[[University of Ottawa]]'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/historic-football-rivalry-between-carleton-ottawa-reborn-1.1913598|title=Historic football rivalry between Carleton, Ottawa reborn|date=5 October 2013|publisher=|accessdate=12 December 2015}}</ref>\nThese two schools are cross-city rivals in [[Ottawa, Ontario]] and have historically had the largest football rivalry in the country. The [[Carleton Ravens]] and the [[Ottawa Gee-Gees]] played the annual [[Panda Game]] from 1955 to 1998, which consistently garnered a national spotlight and was renowned for its size and popularity. The Panda Game was absent for 15 years after Carleton shut down their football program, but was revived in 2013 when Carleton restarted their football program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arc.library.carleton.ca/exhibits/ravens_football/panda|title=Panda-monium|website = Archives and Research Collections|publisher=Carleton University| url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150429163333/http://arc.library.carleton.ca/exhibits/ravens_football/panda|archivedate =29 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe rivalry is also on display on the basketball court, where both schools' teams are among the best in Canada.\n*'''[[University of Western Ontario]]''' and '''[[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]]'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://queensjournal.ca/story/2012-09-18/features/some-things-never-change/?flavour=mobile|title=Some things never change|publisher=The Queen's Journal|accessdate=|last = Shouldice|first = Alison|date = 18 September 2012}}</ref>\nThese two universities have one of the oldest rivalries in Canada.

A final opposing Paris to, for example, Lyon would see students from all over France cheering for Lyon, especially with the anthem \"Province unie, tous contre Paris !\" (\"Province united, all against Paris !\", the \"province\" being a somewhat pejorative term used to designate any place in France outside of Paris). The Paris students would respond by boasting their status as a Grande \u00e9cole and \u00e9lite institution.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\n==Greece==\n*'''[[University of Macedonia]]''' and '''[[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]]''' in [[Thessaloniki]].\n\n==Hong Kong==\n*'''[[Chinese University of Hong Kong|The Chinese University of Hong Kong]]''', and '''[[University of Hong Kong|The University of Hong Kong]]'''\n\n==India==\n*'''[[Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad]]''', and '''[[Indian Institute of Management Bangalore]]'''{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n*'''[[St. Stephen's College, Delhi]]''', and '''[[Hindu College, University of Delhi]]'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/stephen-s-hindu-in-t20-battle/cid/515887|title=Stephen's & Hindu in T20 battle|last=|first=|date=2008-12-20|website=[[Telegraph India]]|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/the-clash-of-delhi-university-s-sporting-titans/story-DHYpIYbStFiWS4T9kqNU2K.html|title=The clash of Delhi University\u2019s sporting titans|date=2018-09-07|website=Hindustan Times|language=en|access-date=2020-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/22247349/the-capital-transition|title=The Capital transition|last=Santhanam|first=S.|date=2012-07-31|website=[[ESPN Cricinfo]]|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-27|quote=There were players like [[Hari Gidwani]] who would skip a [[Ranji Trophy|Ranji]] game to play for his Hindu College.

[[College]]s within each University are also known to nurture keen rivalries, such as that between [[Oriel College, Oxford]] and [[Pembroke College, Oxford]], centred around rowing, that between [[Exeter College, Oxford]] and [[Jesus College, Oxford]], both being directly opposite each other on Turl Street, or that between [[Brasenose College, Oxford]] and [[Lincoln College, Oxford]], one of two pairs of \"[[semi-detached]]\" colleges in Oxbridge \u2013 the other being [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]] and [[Trinity College, Oxford|Trinity College]] in Broad Street, Oxford. Another keen rivalry is that between [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford]], and [[the Queen's College, Oxford]], dating back to the time when the Queen's College owned St Edmund Hall. In Cambridge, rivalries exist between '''[[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's]]''' and '''[[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity]]''', two of the richest colleges of the university and all of Oxbridge.

It can be traced to their foundation in the 1820s when King's College was established as an [[Anglican]] alternative to the secular University College. The [[third-oldest university in England debate]] between the two universities and other parties continues to this day.\n\n'''[[King's College London]]''' and '''[[University of Bradford]]''' also have a departmental rivalry.

This violence and rivalry subsided with the relocating from Watson's and the change to both School becoming day schools rather than boarding. Today the rivalry extends only to the sports pitch although there is rumour of a raid in the 1970/80s of a group of Watsonian finding themselves in the Heriots cafeteria with several stink bombs.<ref>https://www.george-heriots.com/assets/0002/5144/Quadrangle_Spring_2013.pdf</ref>\n*'''[[Epsom College]]''' and '''[[St John's School,Leatherhead]]''', are have a rivalry in sports, especially rugby and hockey.\n\n==United States==<!-- This section is linked from [[College football]] -->\n{{see also|List of NCAA college football rivalry games|List of black college football classics}}\nSchool rivalries are important in the United States, especially in [[college athletics|intercollegiate sports]].

One of several sports rivalries involving teams from Chicago and Milwaukee, alongside the [[Brewers\u2013Cubs rivalry]] and (by proxy) the [[Bears\u2013Packers rivalry]]. The rivalry reached its zenith in the late 1970s, when both DePaul and Marquette were national powers. However, the rivalry has, as of late, heavily favored Marquette, with the Milwaukee school winning approximately four out of every five meetings since the early 1990s.\n*'''[[Georgetown Hoyas]]''' and '''[[St. John's Red Storm]]''' \u2014 These two \"Catholic 7\" schools, neither of which plays Division I FBS football (Georgetown plays in Division I FCS, and St. John's has no football program), had their basketball teams rise to prominence in the 1980s, having numerous meetings that impacted the [[1985 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Championship]] as well as the Big East title. Both teams were known for their charismatic coaches, [[John Thompson (basketball)|John Thompson]] at Georgetown and [[Lou Carnesecca]] at St. John's. Rivalry has declined in recent years. This rivalry has also influenced other sports, as the two schools' baseball teams opened [[Citi Field]] on March 29, 2009 with the third game of a three-game series that started at Georgetown. The Hoyas won the game, and the series.\n* '''Georgetown Hoyas''' and '''Villanova Wildcats''' \u2014 These two Division I FCS football schools share an intense rivalry in basketball, stemming from [[1984\u201385 Villanova Wildcats men's basketball team|Villanova's]] defeat of [[John Thompson (basketball)|John Thompson]]'s [[1984\u201385 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team|Hoya team]] in the [[1985 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1985 NCAA championship]] game. The rivalry takes on a religious tone as [[Order of Saint Augustine|Augustinian]] (Villanova) versus [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] (Georgetown). Jokes about the opposing orders fly back and forth during the week preceding Villanova-Georgetown. In recent years the rivalry has undergone somewhat of a revival, with both teams enjoying success in the regular season and recent NCAA tournaments. This rivalry continues in the reconfigured Big East.<ref>{{cite web|title=Georgetown 66, Villanova 64|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=250150222|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=1 September 2013|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> \n* '''Providence Friars''' and '''Villanova Wildcats''' \u2014 The two smallest schools in the original Big East battle each year.

This [[List of sports rivalries|rivalry]] can extend to both [[academia|academics]] and [[College athletics|athletics]], the latter being typically better known to the general public. These schools place an added emphasis on emerging victorious in any event that includes their rival. This may include the creation of a special trophy or other commemoration of the event. While many of these rivalries have arisen spontaneously, some have been created by college officials in efforts to sell more tickets and support their programs.\n\n==Definition of a sports rivalry==\nRivalries traverse many different fields within society. A rivalry develops from the product of competition and ritualism between different parties. A rivalry is defined as \"a perceptual categorizing process in which actors identify which states are sufficiently threatening competitors\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=William|title=Identifying Rivals and Rivalries in World Politics|journal=International Studies Quarterly|year=2001|volume=45|pages=557|doi=10.1111/0020-8833.00214}}</ref> Ritualism is \"a series of ... iterated acts or performances that are ... famous in terms 'not entirely encoded by the performer'; that is, they are imbued by meanings external to the performer\".<ref name=\"Seligman\">{{cite journal|last=Seligman|first=Adam B. |title=Ritual, the Self, and Sincerity|journal=Social Research: An International Quarterly|volume = 76 | issue = 4| date = Winter 2009|pages = 1073\u20131096|publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/527713/pdf}}</ref> Everyone that is part of the sports event in some capacity becomes a part of the ritualism. Teams get together before the game to warm up, coaches shake hands with each other, captains have a determinant of who gets the ball first, everyone stands during the national anthem, the fans sit in specific areas, they make certain gestures with their hands throughout the game, they wear specific gear that is associated with the team, and they have the same post-game practices every game of every season of every year.<ref name=\"Clotfelter 2011 72\">{{cite book|last=Clotfelter|first=Charles|title=Big-Time Sports in American Universities|year=2011|pages=72}}</ref> It is through this consistency of playing the same teams yearly that \"these rivalries have shown remarkable staying power\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Clotfelter|first=Charles|title=Big-Time Sports in American Universities|year=2011|pages=49\u201350}}</ref> Specifically, it is society's drive to disrupt these original rituals that start rivalries. [[Horst Helle]] says, \"society needs a particular quantitative relationship of harmony and disharmony, association and competition, favour and disfavour, in order to take shape in a specific way\".<ref name=\"Seligman\"/> Society is drawn to this in sports because this is a principal characteristic in everyday life, which can be seen in historic religious rivalries, such as the contemporary example of sectarianism in Glasgow. Within an area, differences between two types of people can drive the start of a rivalry. Competition and support keep the rivalry going.\n\nIn sports, competition tests who has better skill and ability at the time of the game through play. Many rivalries persist because the competition is between two teams that have similar abilities. Spectators gravitate towards competitive rivalries because they are interesting to watch and unpredictable. Society follows competitions because competitions influence \"the unity of society\".<ref name=\"Helle 2008 949\">{{cite journal|last=Helle|first=Horst|title=Soziologie Der Konkurrenz \u2013 Sociology of Competition by Georg Simmel|journal=Canadian Journal of Sociology|year=2008|volume=33|series=4|pages=949}}</ref> Being loyal to one team in a rivalry brings a sense of belonging to a community of supporters that are hoping that the team they are rooting for wins. The fans of the two different teams do not sit next to each other because this disrupts the community. In a similar way, competition displays an indirect way of fighting.<ref name=\"Helle 2008 949\"/> Society does not condone direct fighting as a way of getting something so this is the most passive aggressive way of fighting. Because this is an acceptable practice, there are many supporters of competition as they fuel a way for the people to participate in a rivalry without the consequences of fighting. However, when the competition is not enough in sports and the tensions are high fighting does ensue.\n\n==Important contributors that fuel a rivalry==\nAn important precursor to having a rivalry is having intense competitive play between two sports teams within the ritualistic structure of the game. A competition is \"a form of struggle fought by means of objective performances, to the advantage of a third [party]\",<ref>{{cite journal|last=Helle|first=Horst|title=Soziologie Der Konkurrenz \u2013 Sociology of Competition by Georg Simmel|journal=Canadian Journal of Sociology|year=2008|volume=33|series=4|pages=946}}</ref> which in sports is driven by the team dynamic, and external outlets such as the fans and the media. These external outlets give rivalries more distinctive importance. An example of a rivalry that embodies this is the [[Yankees\u2013Red Sox rivalry]].\n\n===The team dynamic===\nIn such sports as basketball and football there is a stress on the importance of teamwork. This is so because the team is a smaller society that needs to function properly. This means that they need good communication and get necessary goals accomplished for the team. Because of this, the individual on the team is seen as less important than the group as everyone works toward the goal of making the group the best it can possibly be. Players do this \"in the form of obedience to authority, group loyalty, and the willingness to sacrifice for the good of the group.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Coakley|first=Jay|title=Sports in Society|year=2004|pages=435}}</ref>\n\n===The spectators===\nThe spectators, also known as fans, of sporting events are the largest population associated with the event. Fans exhibit \"intangible feelings of pride, solidarity, and pleasure\" for a particular team<ref>{{cite book|last=Clotfelter|first=Charles|title=Big-Time Sports in American Universities|year=2011|pages=200}}</ref> and brand loyalty, which means that they \"heavily identify[y] with a particular team or university and have shown that the self-esteem of these ardent fans can be affected by their team's success in competition\".<ref name=\"Clotfelter 2011 72\"/> This is important in rivalries because fans can determine the outcome of the game and the overall mood throughout the game. The fans have a lot of power because of this fact and therefore possess indirect power and determination on the outcome of the game.\n\n===The media===\nThe media connect the team, with the fans and the rest of the world. \"The media do[es not] 'tell it like it is.' Rather, they tell it in a way that supports the interests of those who benefit from cultural commitments to competition, productivity, and material success.\"<ref name=\"Coakley 2004 428\">{{cite book|last=Coakley|first=Jay|title=Sports in Society|year=2004|pages=428}}</ref> This is known as consumerism because the media influences society's emotions to think of the rivalries in a way that will get people to be as passionate about the game as they want to be. It is spectators' enjoyment of sports and the associated rivalries that drive media sport consumption.<ref name=\"Coakley 2004 428\"/>\n\nFans become constitutively invested in a team, commercial enterprises find ways to make money off them, the media covers analysis of the rivalry, and the teams become emotionally invested, leading to tensions between the teams.\n\n==Australia==\n\n*'''[[Prince Alfred College]]''' and '''[[St Peter's College, Adelaide|Saint Peter's College]]'''\nEach sport has an annual intercollegiate showdown between the two prestigious schools, known as the \"Intercol\". These are considered by the two colleges to be the most important games of the season, and the fiercely fought matches draw big crowds of students and old scholars from both schools. The Intercols have been played for over 100 years. The Cricket Intercollegiate match has been competed in since 1878. According to Richard Sproull this is \"the oldest unbroken annual contest in the history of cricket\" (Weekend Australian 5/6 December 1992). For the sport of rowing, the intercol is competed during South Australia's 'Head of the River Regatta', on the second to last Saturday of the first school term, with one of the two school's taking out the statewide title nearly every year since its beginning. \n*'''[[Nudgee College]]''' and '''[[Gregory Terrace (school)|Gregory Terrace]]'''\nIn 1991, the following legend was printed in the Centennial Rugby Programme, dubbed \u2013 \"The Battle of The Colours\", for the 100th anniversary of the annual Nudgee vs Terrace rugby match. The legend has it that the two St Joseph's, who both wore the Christian Brothers traditional Blue and White, played off in a Rugby game to decide who would keep the prestigious colours. As the story goes Nudgee won the match seeing them keep the colours with Gregory Terrace changing to the now famed Red and Black. This fierce rivalry has continued ever since in every sport yet Rugby continues to stand head and shoulders above the rest, with crowds of up to 10 000 attending First XV fixtures. As two of the biggest Rugby schools in Australia the schools also compete for the St Joseph's Cup. \n*'''[[Jane Franklin Hall]]''', '''[[St. John Fisher College (University of Tasmania)|John Fisher College]]''' and [[Christ College (University of Tasmania)|'''Christ College''']]\nIntercollege Sport has been played between Jane Franklin Hall, Christ College and St. John Fisher College for many years, with many sports played, most importantly Rugby, Cricket and Australian Rules football. These matches are fiercely contested, indeed playing a part in the winning Rugby side is considered the crowning achievement in ones time at college. Jane Franklin Hall has had the edge in sporting prowess over the years in most sports \u2013 with its winning streak in Soccer extending back to the mid 1980s, for example \u2013 apart from Rugby which is very tightly contested, with Christ College coming out the victor more often over recent years. Each year, the colleges compete for the Intercollege Cup, which is decided based on points earned from sporting results. Each sport is allocated various points for first, second and third, and weighted to reward the college that wins the more prestigious sports of Rugby, Football and Cricket, with Rugby given the highest weighting.\n\n==Belgium==\n*'''[[Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain]]''' and '''[[Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles]]'''.\n*'''[[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]]''' and '''[[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]]'''.\nRivalry started in the 1830s when the [[Free University of Brussels (1834\u20131969)|Free University of Brussels]] was established as a [[non-religious]] and [[freethinking]] university whereas the old [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834\u20131968)|Catholic University of Leuven]] \u2013 refounded in 1835 \u2013 remained under Church control. The rivalry survived the division of the two original foundations into separate Dutch-speaking and French-speaking establishments, in 1968 and 1970 respectively. Nowadays control of the Church over the two catholic universities has diminished and they are largely pluralist, accepting students and professors from all religions and backgrounds, but the rivalry with the two secular universities in Brussels continues. This rivalry finds expression mainly among academics and traditional student activities as intercollegiate sports remain largely developed in Belgium.\n\n==Canada==\n*'''[[Carleton University]]''' and '''[[University of Ottawa]]'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/historic-football-rivalry-between-carleton-ottawa-reborn-1.1913598|title=Historic football rivalry between Carleton, Ottawa reborn|date=5 October 2013|publisher=|accessdate=12 December 2015}}</ref>\nThese two schools are cross-city rivals in [[Ottawa, Ontario]] and have historically had the largest football rivalry in the country.

[[College]]s within each University are also known to nurture keen rivalries, such as that between [[Oriel College, Oxford]] and [[Pembroke College, Oxford]], centred around rowing, that between [[Exeter College, Oxford]] and [[Jesus College, Oxford]], both being directly opposite each other on Turl Street, or that between [[Brasenose College, Oxford]] and [[Lincoln College, Oxford]], one of two pairs of \"[[semi-detached]]\" colleges in Oxbridge \u2013 the other being [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]] and [[Trinity College, Oxford|Trinity College]] in Broad Street, Oxford. Another keen rivalry is that between [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford]], and [[the Queen's College, Oxford]], dating back to the time when the Queen's College owned St Edmund Hall. In Cambridge, rivalries exist between '''[[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's]]''' and '''[[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity]]''', two of the richest colleges of the university and all of Oxbridge.

The [[third-oldest university in England debate]] between the two universities and other parties continues to this day.\n\n'''[[King's College London]]''' and '''[[University of Bradford]]''' also have a departmental rivalry.

This violence and rivalry subsided with the relocating from Watson's and the change to both School becoming day schools rather than boarding. Today the rivalry extends only to the sports pitch although there is rumour of a raid in the 1970/80s of a group of Watsonian finding themselves in the Heriots cafeteria with several stink bombs.<ref>https://www.george-heriots.com/assets/0002/5144/Quadrangle_Spring_2013.pdf</ref>\n*'''[[Epsom College]]''' and '''[[St John's School,Leatherhead]]''', are have a rivalry in sports, especially rugby and hockey.\n\n==United States==<!-- This section is linked from [[College football]] -->\n{{see also|List of NCAA college football rivalry games|List of black college football classics}}\nSchool rivalries are important in the United States, especially in [[college athletics|intercollegiate sports]].

One of several sports rivalries involving teams from Chicago and Milwaukee, alongside the [[Brewers\u2013Cubs rivalry]] and (by proxy) the [[Bears\u2013Packers rivalry]]. The rivalry reached its zenith in the late 1970s, when both DePaul and Marquette were national powers. However, the rivalry has, as of late, heavily favored Marquette, with the Milwaukee school winning approximately four out of every five meetings since the early 1990s.\n*'''[[Georgetown Hoyas]]''' and '''[[St. John's Red Storm]]''' \u2014 These two \"Catholic 7\" schools, neither of which plays Division I FBS football (Georgetown plays in Division I FCS, and St. John's has no football program), had their basketball teams rise to prominence in the 1980s, having numerous meetings that impacted the [[1985 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Championship]] as well as the Big East title. Both teams were known for their charismatic coaches, [[John Thompson (basketball)|John Thompson]] at Georgetown and [[Lou Carnesecca]] at St. John's. Rivalry has declined in recent years. This rivalry has also influenced other sports, as the two schools' baseball teams opened [[Citi Field]] on March 29, 2009 with the third game of a three-game series that started at Georgetown. The Hoyas won the game, and the series.\n* '''Georgetown Hoyas''' and '''Villanova Wildcats''' \u2014 These two Division I FCS football schools share an intense rivalry in basketball, stemming from [[1984\u201385 Villanova Wildcats men's basketball team|Villanova's]] defeat of [[John Thompson (basketball)|John Thompson]]'s [[1984\u201385 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team|Hoya team]] in the [[1985 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1985 NCAA championship]] game. The rivalry takes on a religious tone as [[Order of Saint Augustine|Augustinian]] (Villanova) versus [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] (Georgetown). Jokes about the opposing orders fly back and forth during the week preceding Villanova-Georgetown. In recent years the rivalry has undergone somewhat of a revival, with both teams enjoying success in the regular season and recent NCAA tournaments. This rivalry continues in the reconfigured Big East.<ref>{{cite web|title=Georgetown 66, Villanova 64|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=250150222|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=1 September 2013|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> \n* '''Providence Friars''' and '''Villanova Wildcats''' \u2014 The two smallest schools in the original Big East battle each year.

No. 5, Sept 1980</ref> Its dark coloration and distinct song are what separates it as a subspecies of other seaside sparrows. Found in the marshes of Florida's Atlantic Coast on Merrit Island and the upper St. Johns River, the dusky seaside sparrow was geographically isolated from other seaside sparrows (Hill 239). It was categorized as a subspecies in 1973. Even though the dusky's mitochondrial DNA is the same as the mitochondrial DNA of other seaside sparrow populations, DNA testing by itself does not demonstrate that its subspecies classification is undeserving (Hill 239). In 1981, only five dusky seaside sparrows remained, all being males. Conservation efforts were made by trying to breed the remaining duskies with Scott's seaside sparrows in order to create half dusky hybrid offspring. \"Unfortunately, although the Fish and Wildlife Service initially supported the crossbreeding program, it withdrew its support due to Interior's hybrid policy\" (Hill 239). Due to only the males being left, even though duskies could be crossbred with other seaside sparrows, there would never be another pure dusky seaside sparrow again.<ref>[http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1424&context=ealr The Endangered Species Act: What Do We Mean by Species?], from the ''Boston College Environmental Affairs Law Review'', volume 20, issue 2, article 3; by Kevin D.

Since it has been established that the dusky sparrow had a very small inhabited locale, it was isolated from other sparrows for a very long time. Assuming that the mtDNA in sparrows evolves at the rate which is estimated for mammals and other birds (approximately 2\u20134% every million years), then the last time the dusky sparrow was in contact with Scott's seaside sparrow was approximately 250,000\u2013500,000 years ago, giving plenty of time for the dusky sparrow to establish differences between other varieties of species, such as its unique plumage and call.<ref>[https://search.proquest.com/docview/213550432]</ref>\n\n== Causes for extinction ==\n[[File:Ammodramus maritimus.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration by [[John James Audubon]]]] \n[[Image:Ammodramus maritimus nigrescens.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration by [[Martin Johnson Heade]]]]\nWhen Merritt Island was flooded with the goal of reducing the [[mosquito]] population around the [[Kennedy Space Center]], the sparrows' nesting grounds were devastated, and their numbers plummeted. Later, the marshes surrounding the river were drained to facilitate highway construction; this was a further blow. Eventually, pollution and pesticides took such a high toll that by 1979, only six dusky seaside sparrows were known to exist \u2014 all of whom were males; a female was last sighted in 1975.\n\n== Last specimens ==\n[[Captive breeding]] of all remaining dusky seaside sparrows with the [[Scott's seaside sparrow]] (''A. m. peninsulae'') from Florida's gulf coast was approved in 1979.  By 1980 five dusky seaside sparrows were in a captive breeding facility in Gainesville, Florida. One, banded in 1978 with an orange leg band, was unique.\n\n\"Orange Band\" was left by himself on the St. Johns Unit of the St. Johns NWR<ref>[http://www.fws.gov/refuges/profiles/index.cfm?id=41573 St. Johns National Wildlife Refuge] at the [[US Fish and Wildlife Service]]; retrieved October 26, 2012</ref> after a yellow-leg-banded dusky was captured in 1979. Field observations of color banded sparrows from 1975 to 1979 indicated that dusky seaside sparrows seldom traveled more than a mile or two in their lifetimes. In April 1980, \"Orange Band\" was again observed on the St. Johns Unit, but was surprisingly captured in June eight miles south on the Beeline Unit in the company of a dusky with a green leg band. Before finding \"Green Band\", \"Orange Band\" passed the general vicinity of the two unbanded dusky seaside sparrows.\n\nIn 1983 the last four living dusky seaside sparrows were taken to the [[Walt Disney World Resort]], to continue [[crossbreeding]] and living out their days in a protected habitat on the [[Discovery Island (Bay Lake)|Discovery Island]] nature reserve. By March 31, 1986, only \"Orange Band\" remained.\n\nDespite being blind in one eye, \"Orange Band\" reached extreme old age for a sparrow, living at least nine years, and possibly as many as thirteen, before dying on June 17, 1987.\n\nAfter the death of the final \"pure\" dusky sparrow, the breeding program was discontinued due to the fact that it was thought the hybrids that exist could not reproduce to create dusky sparrows, since they did not share the proper mtDNA that dusky sparrows possess. However, research done on a similar species known as ''Passerella iliaca'', or the fox sparrow,  was able to show that some subspecies of one plumage group had the plumage of another despite having the \"wrong\" mtDNA type.  This potentially meant that if the breeding program was continued with the dusky sparrow hybrids, sparrows with the same color plumage as the dusky sparrows would eventually be produced. Unfortunately, shortly after the breeding program was halted, the remaining hybrid sparrows either died or escaped captivity, leading to the final extinction of the taxon.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0006-3207(95)00010-2 |title=Conservation genetics of the extinct dusky seaside sparrow Ammodramus maritimus nigrescens |journal=Biological Conservation |volume=74 |issue=1 |pages=69\u201371 |year=1995 |last1=Zink |first1=Robert M. |last2=Kale |first2=Herbert W. }}</ref>\n\n\"Green Band\" proved elusive, and was never recaptured after having been banded.

Assuming that the mtDNA in sparrows evolves at the rate which is estimated for mammals and other birds (approximately 2\u20134% every million years), then the last time the dusky sparrow was in contact with Scott's seaside sparrow was approximately 250,000\u2013500,000 years ago, giving plenty of time for the dusky sparrow to establish differences between other varieties of species, such as its unique plumage and call.<ref>[https://search.proquest.com/docview/213550432]</ref>\n\n== Causes for extinction ==\n[[File:Ammodramus maritimus.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration by [[John James Audubon]]]] \n[[Image:Ammodramus maritimus nigrescens.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration by [[Martin Johnson Heade]]]]\nWhen Merritt Island was flooded with the goal of reducing the [[mosquito]] population around the [[Kennedy Space Center]], the sparrows' nesting grounds were devastated, and their numbers plummeted. Later, the marshes surrounding the river were drained to facilitate highway construction; this was a further blow. Eventually, pollution and pesticides took such a high toll that by 1979, only six dusky seaside sparrows were known to exist \u2014 all of whom were males; a female was last sighted in 1975.\n\n== Last specimens ==\n[[Captive breeding]] of all remaining dusky seaside sparrows with the [[Scott's seaside sparrow]] (''A. m. peninsulae'') from Florida's gulf coast was approved in 1979.  By 1980 five dusky seaside sparrows were in a captive breeding facility in Gainesville, Florida. One, banded in 1978 with an orange leg band, was unique.\n\n\"Orange Band\" was left by himself on the St. Johns Unit of the St. Johns NWR<ref>[http://www.fws.gov/refuges/profiles/index.cfm?id=41573 St. Johns National Wildlife Refuge] at the [[US Fish and Wildlife Service]]; retrieved October 26, 2012</ref> after a yellow-leg-banded dusky was captured in 1979. Field observations of color banded sparrows from 1975 to 1979 indicated that dusky seaside sparrows seldom traveled more than a mile or two in their lifetimes. In April 1980, \"Orange Band\" was again observed on the St. Johns Unit, but was surprisingly captured in June eight miles south on the Beeline Unit in the company of a dusky with a green leg band. Before finding \"Green Band\", \"Orange Band\" passed the general vicinity of the two unbanded dusky seaside sparrows.\n\nIn 1983 the last four living dusky seaside sparrows were taken to the [[Walt Disney World Resort]], to continue [[crossbreeding]] and living out their days in a protected habitat on the [[Discovery Island (Bay Lake)|Discovery Island]] nature reserve. By March 31, 1986, only \"Orange Band\" remained.\n\nDespite being blind in one eye, \"Orange Band\" reached extreme old age for a sparrow, living at least nine years, and possibly as many as thirteen, before dying on June 17, 1987.\n\nAfter the death of the final \"pure\" dusky sparrow, the breeding program was discontinued due to the fact that it was thought the hybrids that exist could not reproduce to create dusky sparrows, since they did not share the proper mtDNA that dusky sparrows possess. However, research done on a similar species known as ''Passerella iliaca'', or the fox sparrow,  was able to show that some subspecies of one plumage group had the plumage of another despite having the \"wrong\" mtDNA type.  This potentially meant that if the breeding program was continued with the dusky sparrow hybrids, sparrows with the same color plumage as the dusky sparrows would eventually be produced. Unfortunately, shortly after the breeding program was halted, the remaining hybrid sparrows either died or escaped captivity, leading to the final extinction of the taxon.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0006-3207(95)00010-2 |title=Conservation genetics of the extinct dusky seaside sparrow Ammodramus maritimus nigrescens |journal=Biological Conservation |volume=74 |issue=1 |pages=69\u201371 |year=1995 |last1=Zink |first1=Robert M. |last2=Kale |first2=Herbert W. }}</ref>\n\n\"Green Band\" proved elusive, and was never recaptured after having been banded.

Sladen also reprised [[Sarah Jane Smith]] in a spin-off series simply entitled ''[[Sarah Jane Smith: Comeback|Sarah Jane Smith]]''. Sladen never appeared as Sarah alongside any incarnation of the Doctor for Big Finish; a series with Tom Baker was planned, but was never recorded due to Sladen's untimely death in April 2011.\n\nInitially Matthew Waterhouse declined to reprise the role of Adric so the character was recast and played by [[Andrew Sachs]] as [[The Boy That Time Forgot|an older version of the character]]. Waterhouse later returned to the role on an ongoing basis.\n\nBig Finish also started ''[[Doctor Who - The Companion Chronicles|The Companion Chronicles]]'' series of plays, featuring a companion or friend of the Doctor and a supporting cast member.

These plays were rebroadcast on BBC7 beginning in July 2006. ''The Chimes of Midnight'' was repeated again as part of \"''The New Eighth Doctor Adventures''\" Series 1 & 2 in 2009.\n\nIn January 2007, a new series of Eighth Doctor audio adventures was broadcast on BBC7.  These starred McGann alongside Sheridan Smith as the aforementioned new companion Lucie Miller.  There were eight 50-minute episodes in total; the first and last stories were two-parters, and the rest were single episodes.  These adventures have since been released on CD. In 2008, BBC7 broadcast the second series of ''The New Eighth Doctor Adventures'' (which Big Finish had already released on CD) bar the final two-part story. All fourteen episodes were then repeated in 2009, and the final two-part story later that year. Big Finish has gone on to produce two further series of these ''Adventures'', and four selected stories from the third series were aired in 2010, with BBC Radio 4 Extra (as Radio 7 became) skipping ahead to the fourth series in early 2013.\n\nIn May/June 2011, BBC Radio 4 Extra broadcast the Fifth Doctor stories ''Cobwebs'', ''The Whispering Forest,'' and ''Cradle of the Snake''. In May/June 2012, these were followed by the Seventh Doctor stories ''A Thousand Tiny Wings'', ''Survival of the Fittest'', ''Klein's Story'' and ''The Architects of History''. For the fiftieth anniversary of the show, BBC Radio 4 Extra repeated several stories and broadcast two new stories; ''[[Protect and Survive]]'' starring Sylvester McCoy and ''1963: Fanfare for the Common Men'' starring Peter Davison.

Sladen also reprised [[Sarah Jane Smith]] in a spin-off series simply entitled ''[[Sarah Jane Smith: Comeback|Sarah Jane Smith]]''. Sladen never appeared as Sarah alongside any incarnation of the Doctor for Big Finish; a series with Tom Baker was planned, but was never recorded due to Sladen's untimely death in April 2011.\n\nInitially Matthew Waterhouse declined to reprise the role of Adric so the character was recast and played by [[Andrew Sachs]] as [[The Boy That Time Forgot|an older version of the character]]. Waterhouse later returned to the role on an ongoing basis.\n\nBig Finish also started ''[[Doctor Who - The Companion Chronicles|The Companion Chronicles]]'' series of plays, featuring a companion or friend of the Doctor and a supporting cast member.

These plays were rebroadcast on BBC7 beginning in July 2006. ''The Chimes of Midnight'' was repeated again as part of \"''The New Eighth Doctor Adventures''\" Series 1 & 2 in 2009.\n\nIn January 2007, a new series of Eighth Doctor audio adventures was broadcast on BBC7.  These starred McGann alongside Sheridan Smith as the aforementioned new companion Lucie Miller.  There were eight 50-minute episodes in total; the first and last stories were two-parters, and the rest were single episodes.  These adventures have since been released on CD. In 2008, BBC7 broadcast the second series of ''The New Eighth Doctor Adventures'' (which Big Finish had already released on CD) bar the final two-part story. All fourteen episodes were then repeated in 2009, and the final two-part story later that year. Big Finish has gone on to produce two further series of these ''Adventures'', and four selected stories from the third series were aired in 2010, with BBC Radio 4 Extra (as Radio 7 became) skipping ahead to the fourth series in early 2013.\n\nIn May/June 2011, BBC Radio 4 Extra broadcast the Fifth Doctor stories ''Cobwebs'', ''The Whispering Forest,'' and ''Cradle of the Snake''. In May/June 2012, these were followed by the Seventh Doctor stories ''A Thousand Tiny Wings'', ''Survival of the Fittest'', ''Klein's Story'' and ''The Architects of History''. For the fiftieth anniversary of the show, BBC Radio 4 Extra repeated several stories and broadcast two new stories; ''[[Protect and Survive]]'' starring Sylvester McCoy and ''1963: Fanfare for the Common Men'' starring Peter Davison.

This overexpression often correlates with poor projected outcomes in several different types of cancers, including blood cancers such as acute myeloid leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Healthy or normal cells use CD47 to avoid detection by macrophages by signaling the SIRP-alpha receptor that they are not to be eaten. Macrophages are the first responders of the body's immune system, phagocytosing, or \u201ceating,\u201d any abnormal, old or foreign cells.\n\nTo escape elimination by macrophages, cancer cells utilize this \u201cdon\u2019t eat me\u201d signaling ability. Macrophages can only perceive threats when the \u201ceat me\u201d signals significantly outnumber the \u201cdon\u2019t eat me\u201d signals present on a foreign invader pathogen or damaged/abnormal cell.\n\nForty Seven's magrolimab (previously referred to as 5F9) attaches to CD47 expressors on cancerous cells, blocking the interaction with a macrophage's SIRP-alpha. This mechanism blocks the \u201cdon\u2019t eat me\u201d signal and activates the \u201ceat me\u201d signal. \n \nNormal cells do not produce \u201ceat me signals\u201d or other giveaway signs and so are generally immune to the effects of magrolimab and do not become a target for antibodies.\n<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Huang |first1=Yuting |title=Targeting CD47: the achievements and concerns of current studies on cancer immunotherapy |journal=Journal of Thoracic Disease |date=February 2017 |volume=9(2) |doi=10.21037/jtd.2017.02.30 |pmid=28275508 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5334085/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Clinical Trials Using Anti-CD47 Monoclonal Antibody Hu5F9-G4 |url=https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials/intervention/anti-cd47-monoclonal-antibody-hu5f9-g4 |website=Cancer.Gov |accessdate=7 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Forty Seven, Inc.

This overexpression often correlates with poor projected outcomes in several different types of cancers, including blood cancers such as acute myeloid leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Healthy or normal cells use CD47 to avoid detection by macrophages by signaling the SIRP-alpha receptor that they are not to be eaten. Macrophages are the first responders of the body\u2019s immune system, phagocytosing, or \u201ceating,\u201d any abnormal, old or foreign cells.\n\nTo escape elimination by macrophages, cancer cells utilize this \u201cdon\u2019t eat me\u201d signaling ability. Macrophages can only perceive threats when the \u201ceat me\u201d signals significantly outnumber the \u201cdon\u2019t eat me\u201d signals present on a foreign invader pathogen or damaged/abnormal cell. \n\nForty Seven\u2019s magrolimab (previously referred to as 5F9) attaches to CD47 expressors on cancerous cells, blocking the interaction with a macrophage\u2019s SIRP-alpha. This mechanism blocks the \u201cdon\u2019t eat me\u201d signal and activates the \u201ceat me\u201d signal. \n \nNormal cells do not produce \u201ceat me signals\u201d or other giveaway signs and so are generally immune to the effects of magrolimab and do not become a target for antibodies.\n<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Huang |first1=Yuting |title=Targeting CD47: the achievements and concerns of current studies on cancer immunotherapy |journal=Journal of Thoracic Disease |date=February 2017 |volume=9(2) |doi=10.21037/jtd.2017.02.30 |pmid=28275508 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5334085/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Clinical Trials Using Anti-CD47 Monoclonal Antibody Hu5F9-G4 |url=https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials/intervention/anti-cd47-monoclonal-antibody-hu5f9-g4 |website=Cancer.Gov |accessdate=7 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Forty Seven, Inc.
