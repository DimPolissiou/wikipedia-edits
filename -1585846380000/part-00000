Use <code>\\ </code> or <code>' '</code> to express whitespace.\n* Extended regex formatting (Perl 5's <code>/x</code>) is now the default.\n\n===Implicit changes===\nSome of the features of Perl 5 regular expressions are more powerful in Raku because of their ability to encapsulate the expanded features of Raku rules. For example, in Perl 5, there were positive and negative lookahead operators <code>(?=...)</code> and <code>(?!...)</code>. In Raku these same features exist, but are called <code><nowiki><before ...></nowiki></code> and <code><nowiki><!before ...></nowiki></code>.\n\nHowever, because <code>before</code> can encapsulate arbitrary rules, it can be used to express lookahead as a [[syntactic predicate]] for a grammar. For example, the following [[parsing expression grammar]] describes the classic [[context-sensitive grammar|non-context-free]] language <math> \\{ a^n b^n c^n : n \\ge 1 \\} </math>:\n\n S \u2190 &(A !b) a+ B\n A \u2190 a A? b\n B \u2190 b B? c\n\nIn Raku rules that would be:\n\n<source lang=\"perl6\">\nrule S { <before <A> <!before b>> a+ <B> }\nrule A { a <A>? b }\nrule B { b <B>? c }\n</source>\n\nOf course, given the ability to mix rules and regular code, that can be simplified even further:\n<source lang=\"Perl6\">\nrule S { (a+) (b+) (c+) <{$0.elems == $1.elems == $2.elems}> }\n</source>\nHowever, this makes use of [[Assertion (computing)|assertions]], which is a subtly different concept in Raku rules, but more substantially different in parsing theory, making this a semantic rather than syntactic predicate. The most important difference in practice is performance. There is no way for the rule engine to know what conditions the assertion may match, so no optimization of this process can be made.\n\n==Integration with Perl==\nIn many languages, regular expressions are entered as strings, which are then passed to library routines that parse and compile them into an internal state. In Perl 5, regular expressions shared some of the [[lexical analysis]] with Perl's scanner. This simplified many aspects of regular expression usage, though it added a great deal of complexity to the scanner. In Raku, rules are part of the grammar of the language. No separate parser exists for rules, as it did in Perl 5. This means that code, embedded in rules, is parsed at the same time as the rule itself and its surrounding code. For example, it is possible to nest rules and code without re-invoking the parser:\n\n<source lang=\"perl6\">\nrule ab {\n    (a.) # match \"a\" followed by any character\n    # Then check to see if that character was \"b\"\n    # If so, print a message.\n    { $0 ~~ /b {say \"found the b\"}/ }\n}\n</source>\n\nThe above is a single block of Raku code that contains an outer rule definition, an inner block of assertion code, and inside of that a regex that contains one more level of assertion.\n\n== Implementation ==\n\n=== Keywords ===\nThere are several keywords used in conjunction with Raku rules:\n\n;regex: A named or anonymous regex that ignores whitespace within the regex by default.\n;token: A named or anonymous regex that implies the <code>:ratchet</code> modifier.\n;rule:  A named or anonymous regex that implies the <code>:ratchet</code> and <code>:sigspace</code> modifiers.\n;rx:    An anonymous regex that takes arbitrary delimiters such as <code>//</code> where regex only takes braces.\n;m:     An operator form of anonymous regex that performs matches with arbitrary delimiters.\n;mm:    Shorthand for m with the <code>:sigspace</code> modifier.\n;s:     An operator form of anonymous regex that performs substitution with arbitrary delimiters.\n;ss:    Shorthand for s with the <code>:sigspace</code> modifier.\n;<code>/.../</code>: Simply placing a regex between slashes is shorthand for <code>rx/.../</code>.\n\nHere is an example of typical use:\n<source lang=\"perl6\">\ntoken word { \\w+ }\nrule phrase { <word> [ \\, <word> ]* \\. }\nif $string ~~ / <phrase> \\n / {\n    ...\n}\n</source>\n\n=== Modifiers ===\nModifiers may be placed after any of the regex keywords, and before the delimiter. If a regex is named, the modifier comes after the name. Modifiers control the way regexes are parsed and how they behave. They are always introduced with a leading <code>:</code> character.\n\nSome of the more important modifiers include:\n\n* <code>:i</code> or <code>:ignorecase</code> &ndash; Perform matching without respect to case.\n* <code>:m</code> or <code>:ignoremark</code> &ndash; Perform matching without respect to combining characters.\n* <code>:g</code> or <code>:global</code> &ndash; Perform the match more than once on a given target string.\n* <code>:s</code> or <code>:sigspace</code> &ndash; Replace whitespace in the regex with a whitespace-matching rule, rather than simply ignoring it.\n* <code>:Perl5</code> &ndash; Treat the regex as a Perl 5 regular expression.\n* <code>:ratchet</code> &ndash; Never perform backtracking in the rule.\n\nFor example:\n<source lang=\"Perl6\">\n regex addition { :ratchet :sigspace <term> \\+ <expr> }\n</source>\n\n=== Grammars ===\nA grammar may be defined using the <code>grammar</code> operator. A grammar is essentially just a [[namespace]] for rules:\n<source lang=\"perl6\">\ngrammar Str::SprintfFormat {\n    regex format_token { \\%: <index>? <precision>? <modifier>? <directive> }\n    token index { \\d+ \\$ }\n    token precision { <flags>? <vector>? <precision_count> }\n    token flags { <[\\ +0\\#\\-]>+ }\n    token precision_count { [ <[1-9]>\\d* | \\* ]?

In contrast to [[Karl Marx]]'s perspective, Lassalle rejected the concept of the [[State (polity)|state]] as a class-based power structure whose main function was to preserve existing class structures, therefore Lassalle also rejected the [[Marxism|Marxist]] view that the state was destined to \"[[Withering away of the state|wither away]]\". Lassalle considered the state to be an entity independent of class allegiances and as an instrument of justice that would therefore be essential for the achievement of socialism.{{sfn|Berlau|1949|p=21}}\n\nEarly concepts of state socialism were articulated by [[Anarchism|anarchist]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] philosophers who opposed the concept of the state. In ''[[Statism and Anarchy]]'', [[Mikhail Bakunin]] identified a [[Statism|statist]] tendency within the Marxist movement which he contrasted to [[libertarian socialism]] and attributed to Marx's philosophy. Bakunin predicted that Marx's theory of transition from [[capitalism]] to [[socialism]] involving the working class seizing state power in a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] would eventually lead to an usurpation of power by the state apparatus acting in its own self-interest, ushering in a new form of capitalism rather than establishing socialism.<ref>Bakunin, Mikhail (1873).

The dictatorial power of this learned minority is concealed by the fiction of a pseudo-representative government which presumes to express the will of the people\".</ref>\n\nAs a political ideology, state socialism rose to prominence during the 20th century [[Bolshevik]], [[Leninist]] and later [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] revolutions where single-party control over the state and by extension over the political and economic spheres of society was justified as a means to safeguard the [[Communist revolution|revolution]] against [[counter-revolutionary]] insurrection and foreign invasion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Flank|first=Lenny|title=Rise and Fall of the Leninist State: A Marxist History of the Soviet Union|publisher=Red and Black Publishers|date=August 2008|isbn=978-1-931859-25-7|page=57|quote=Lenin defended his actions, arguing that the Revolution could be consolidated 'only through dictatorship, because the realization of the transformations immediately and unconditionally necessary for the proletariat and the peasantry will call forth the desperate resistance of the landlords, of the big bourgeoisie, and of Tsarism.

Political philosophies contrasted to state socialism include [[libertarian socialist]] philosophies such as [[anarchism]], [[De Leonism]], [[economic democracy]], [[free-market socialism]], [[libertarian Marxism]] and [[syndicalism]].

In [[Marxism|Marxist theory]], socialism is projected to emerge in the most developed capitalist economies where capitalism suffers the greatest amount of internal contradictions and class conflict. On the other hand, state socialism became a revolutionary theory for the poorest, often quasi-feudal, countries of the world.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Badie|first1=Bertrand|last2=Berg-Schlosser|first2=Dirk|last3=Morlino|first3=Leonardo|title=International Encyclopedia of Political Science|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2011|isbn=978-1412959636|page=2457|quote=Marxist theory was elaborated for, and based on, the most developed countries of the world.

Such systems are described as [[state capitalism]] because the state engages in [[capital accumulation]], mostly as part of the [[primitive accumulation of capital]] (see also the Soviet theory of the [[primitive socialist accumulation]]). The difference is that the state acts as a public entity and engages in this activity in order to achieve socialism by re-investing the accumulated capital into the society, whether be in more healthcare, education, employment or consumer goods, whereas in capitalist societies the surplus extracted from the working class is spent in whatever needs the owners of the means of production wants.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Badie|first1=Bertrand|last2=Berg-Schlosser|first2=Dirk|last3=Morlino|first3=Leonardo|title= International Encyclopedia of Political Science|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2011|isbn=978-1412959636|page=2459|quote=The repressive state apparatus is in fact acting as an instrument of state capitalism to carry out the process of capital accumulation through forcible extraction of surplus from the working class and peasantry.}}</ref>\n\n=== Role of the state in socialism ===\nIn the traditional view of socialism, thinkers like [[Friedrich Engels]] and [[Henri de Saint-Simon]] took the position that the state will change in nature in a socialist society, with the function of the state changing from one of political rule over people into a scientific administration of the processes of production. Specifically, the state would become a coordinating economic entity consisting of interdependent inclusive associations rather than a mechanism of class and political control, in the process ceasing to be a state in the traditional definition.<ref>{{cite book|title=Socialism: Utopian and Scientific|publisher=Marxists Internert Archive|last=Engels|first=Friedrich|chapter-url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch01.htm|date=1880|chapter=The Development of Utopian Socialism|accessdate=12 January 2016|quote=In 1816, he declares that politics is the science of production, and foretells the complete absorption of politics by economics.

But with the victory of Leninism in Russia, all dissent was silenced, and socialism became identified with 'democratic centralism', 'central planning', and State ownership of the means of production.}}</ref>\n\n== Political perspectives ==\nState socialism was traditionally advocated as a means for achieving [[public ownership]] of the means of production through [[nationalization]] of industry. This was intended to be a transitional phase in the process of building a socialist economy. The goals of nationalization were to dispossess large capitalists and consolidate industry so that profit would go toward [[public finance]] rather than private fortune. Nationalization would be the first step in a long-term process of socializing production, introducing employee management and reorganizing production to [[Production for use|directly produce for use]] rather than profit.<ref name=\"The Economics of Feasible Socialism Revisted, 1991. P.176\">Nove, Alexander (1991). ''The Economics of Feasible Socialism Revisited''. Routledge. p. 176. \"The original notion was that nationalization would achieve three objectives. One was to dispossess the big capitalists. The second was to divert the profits from private appropriation to the public purse. Thirdly, the nationalized sector would serve the public good rather than try to make private profits. [...] To these objectives some (but not all) would add some sort of workers' control, the accountability of management to employees\".</ref>\n\n[[Social democrats]] and other [[democratic socialists]] argued for a gradual, peaceful transition from capitalism to socialism. They wish to neutralize or to abolish capitalism, respectively, but through political reform rather than [[revolution]]. This method of gradualism implies utilization of the existing state apparatus and machinery of government to gradually move society toward socialism and is sometimes derided by other socialists as a form of [[socialism from above]] or political elitism for relying on electoral means to achieve socialism.<ref>Draper, Hal (1963). [http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/contemp/pamsetc/twosouls/twosouls.htm \"The Two Souls of Socialism\"]. \"Ferdinand Lassalle is the prototype of the state-socialist -- which means, one who aims to get socialism handed down by the existing state\".</ref>\n\nIn contrast, [[Marxism]] and [[revolutionary socialism]] holds that a [[proletarian revolution]] is the only practical way to implement fundamental changes in the structure of society. Socialists who advocate [[representative democracy]] believe that after a certain period of time under socialism the state will \"[[Withering away of the state|wither away]]\" because class distinctions cease to exist and representative democracy would be replaced by [[direct democracy]] in the remaining public associations comprising the former state. Political power would be decentralized and distributed evenly among the population, producing a [[communist society]].\n\n=== In communist states ===\n{{main|Communist state}}\nThe economic model adopted in the former [[Soviet Union]], [[Eastern Bloc]] and other [[communist states]] is often described as a form of state socialism. The ideological basis for this system was the [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] theory of [[socialism in one country]]. The system that emerged in the 1930s in the Soviet Union was based on state ownership of the means of production and centralized planning, along with bureaucratic management of the workplace by state officials that were ultimately subordinate to the all-encompassing [[communist party]]. Rather than the producers controlling and managing production, the party controlled both the government machinery which directed the national economy on behalf of the communist party and planned the production and distribution of capital goods.\n\nBecause of this, [[Classical Marxism|classical]] and [[orthodox Marxists]] as well as [[Trotskyist]] groups denounced the communist states as being [[Stalinist]] and their economies as being [[state capitalist]] or representing [[Deformed workers' state|deformed]] or [[degenerated workers' state]]s, respectively. Within the socialist movement, there is criticism towards the use of the term socialist states in relation to countries such as [[China]] and previously of Soviet Union and Eastern and Central European states before what some term the \"[[Revolutions of 1989|collapse of Stalinism]]\" in 1989.<ref>Committee for a Workers' International (June 1992).

In particular, some Trotskyist schools call those countries degenerated workers' states to contrast them with proper socialism (i.e. workers' states) while other Trotskyist schools call them state capitalist to emphasize the lack of true socialism and presence of defining capitalist characteristics (wage labor, commodity production and bureaucratic control over workers).\n\n=== In Germany ===\n{{main|State Socialism (Germany)}}\n[[Otto von Bismarck]] implemented a set of social programs between 1883 and 1889 following his [[anti-socialist laws]], partly as remedial measures to appease the working class and detract support for the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD). Bismarck's biographer [[A. J. P. Taylor]] said: \"It would be unfair to say that Bismarck took up social welfare solely to weaken the Social Democrats; he had had it in mind for a long time, and believed in it deeply. But as usual he acted on his beliefs at the exact moment when they served a practical need\".<ref>Taylor, A. J. P. (1955). ''Bismarck. The Man and the Statesman''. London: Hamish Hamilton. p. 202. \"Since he could not shake the Centre, he would win over the Social Democrats\u2014not certainly by appealing to their leaders, whom he was persecuting and sending to prison, but by a constructive social programme, which he hoped would detach the working-class voters from the Social Democratic party. It would be unfair to say that Bismarck took up social welfare solely to weaken the Social Democrats; he had had it in mind for a long time, and believed in it deeply. But as usual he acted on his beliefs at the exact moment when they served a practical need. challenge drove him forward. He first avowed his social programme when Bebel taunted him with his old friendship with Lassalle. He answered by calling himself a Socialist, indeed a more practical Socialist than the Social Democrats; and he provocatively rejoiced in echoing Frederick the Great's wish to be le ''roi des guex'', king of the poor. Richter, the Progressive leader, called Bismarck's proposals 'not Socialistic, but Communistic'. The proposal was merely that part of the cost of Socials Insurance should be borne by the state; and nowadays Bismarck seems the progressive, Richter the unenlightened reactionary\".</ref> When a reference was made to his friendship with [[Ferdinand Lassalle]] (a nationalist and state-oriented socialist), Bismarck said that he was a more practical socialist than the Social Democrats.<ref>Taylor, A.

They use the term state socialism in contrast with their own form of socialism which involves either [[collective ownership]] (in the form of [[worker cooperative]]s) or [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]] without [[Central planning|centralized state planning]].

Bakunin predicted that Marx's theory of transition from [[capitalism]] to [[socialism]] involving the working class seizing state power in a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] would eventually lead to an usurpation of power by the state apparatus acting in its own self-interest, ushering in a new form of capitalism rather than establishing socialism.<ref>Bakunin, Mikhail (1873).

It is often contrasted with non-state or anti-state forms of socialism such as those that advocate direct [[Socialism#Self-managed economy|self-management]] [[adhocracy]] and direct [[worker's cooperative|cooperative]] ownership and management of the means of production. Political philosophies contrasted to state socialism include [[libertarian socialist]] philosophies such as [[anarchism]], [[De Leonism]], [[economic democracy]], [[free-market socialism]], [[libertarian Marxism]] and [[syndicalism]]. These forms of socialism are opposed to hierarchical [[Technocracy|technocratic socialism]], [[scientific management]] and [[Economic planning|state-directed economic planning]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lra.le.ac.uk/handle/2381/3186|title=Redistribution Under State Socialism: A USSR and PRC Comparison|publisher=Leicester Research Archive|accessdate=21 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe modern concept of state socialism, when used in reference to Soviet-style economic and political systems, emerged from a deviation in Marxist theory starting with [[Vladimir Lenin]]. In [[Marxism|Marxist theory]], socialism is projected to emerge in the most developed capitalist economies where capitalism suffers the greatest amount of internal contradictions and class conflict. On the other hand, state socialism became a revolutionary theory for the poorest, often quasi-feudal, countries of the world.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Badie|first1=Bertrand|last2=Berg-Schlosser|first2=Dirk|last3=Morlino|first3=Leonardo|title=International Encyclopedia of Political Science|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2011|isbn=978-1412959636|page=2457|quote=Marxist theory was elaborated for, and based on, the most developed countries of the world. Although the state socialist project originated from Marxist theory, it was, however, a deviation from the original theory of Karl Marx.

Such systems are described as [[state capitalism]] because the state engages in [[capital accumulation]], mostly as part of the [[primitive accumulation of capital]] (see also the Soviet theory of the [[primitive socialist accumulation]]). The difference is that the state acts as a public entity and engages in this activity in order to achieve socialism by re-investing the accumulated capital into the society, whether be in more healthcare, education, employment or consumer goods, whereas in capitalist societies the surplus extracted from the working class is spent in whatever needs the owners of the means of production wants.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Badie|first1=Bertrand|last2=Berg-Schlosser|first2=Dirk|last3=Morlino|first3=Leonardo|title= International Encyclopedia of Political Science|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2011|isbn=978-1412959636|page=2459|quote=The repressive state apparatus is in fact acting as an instrument of state capitalism to carry out the process of capital accumulation through forcible extraction of surplus from the working class and peasantry.}}</ref>\n\n=== Role of the state in socialism ===\nIn the traditional view of socialism, thinkers like [[Friedrich Engels]] and [[Henri de Saint-Simon]] took the position that the state will change in nature in a socialist society, with the function of the state changing from one of political rule over people into a scientific administration of the processes of production. Specifically, the state would become a coordinating economic entity consisting of interdependent inclusive associations rather than a mechanism of class and political control, in the process ceasing to be a state in the traditional definition.<ref>{{cite book|title=Socialism: Utopian and Scientific|publisher=Marxists Internert Archive|last=Engels|first=Friedrich|chapter-url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch01.htm|date=1880|chapter=The Development of Utopian Socialism|accessdate=12 January 2016|quote=In 1816, he declares that politics is the science of production, and foretells the complete absorption of politics by economics.

But with the victory of Leninism in Russia, all dissent was silenced, and socialism became identified with 'democratic centralism', 'central planning', and State ownership of the means of production.}}</ref>\n\n== Political perspectives ==\nState socialism was traditionally advocated as a means for achieving [[public ownership]] of the means of production through [[nationalization]] of industry. This was intended to be a transitional phase in the process of building a socialist economy. The goals of nationalization were to dispossess large capitalists and consolidate industry so that profit would go toward [[public finance]] rather than private fortune. Nationalization would be the first step in a long-term process of socializing production, introducing employee management and reorganizing production to [[Production for use|directly produce for use]] rather than profit.<ref name=\"The Economics of Feasible Socialism Revisted, 1991. P.176\">Nove, Alexander (1991). ''The Economics of Feasible Socialism Revisited''. Routledge. p. 176. \"The original notion was that nationalization would achieve three objectives. One was to dispossess the big capitalists. The second was to divert the profits from private appropriation to the public purse. Thirdly, the nationalized sector would serve the public good rather than try to make private profits. [...] To these objectives some (but not all) would add some sort of workers' control, the accountability of management to employees\".</ref>\n\n[[Social democrats]] and other [[democratic socialists]] argued for a gradual, peaceful transition from capitalism to socialism. They wish to neutralize or to abolish capitalism, respectively, but through political reform rather than [[revolution]]. This method of gradualism implies utilization of the existing state apparatus and machinery of government to gradually move society toward socialism and is sometimes derided by other socialists as a form of [[socialism from above]] or political elitism for relying on electoral means to achieve socialism.<ref>Draper, Hal (1963). [http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/contemp/pamsetc/twosouls/twosouls.htm \"The Two Souls of Socialism\"]. \"Ferdinand Lassalle is the prototype of the state-socialist -- which means, one who aims to get socialism handed down by the existing state\".</ref>\n\nIn contrast, [[Marxism]] and [[revolutionary socialism]] holds that a [[proletarian revolution]] is the only practical way to implement fundamental changes in the structure of society. Socialists who advocate [[representative democracy]] believe that after a certain period of time under socialism the state will \"[[Withering away of the state|wither away]]\" because class distinctions cease to exist and representative democracy would be replaced by [[direct democracy]] in the remaining public associations comprising the former state. Political power would be decentralized and distributed evenly among the population, producing a [[communist society]].\n\n=== In communist states ===\n{{main|Communist state}}\nThe economic model adopted in the former [[Soviet Union]], [[Eastern Bloc]] and other [[communist states]] is often described as a form of state socialism. The ideological basis for this system was the [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] theory of [[socialism in one country]]. The system that emerged in the 1930s in the Soviet Union was based on state ownership of the means of production and centralized planning, along with bureaucratic management of the workplace by state officials that were ultimately subordinate to the all-encompassing [[communist party]]. Rather than the producers controlling and managing production, the party controlled both the government machinery which directed the national economy on behalf of the communist party and planned the production and distribution of capital goods.\n\nBecause of this, [[Classical Marxism|classical]] and [[orthodox Marxists]] as well as [[Trotskyist]] groups denounced the communist states as being [[Stalinist]] and their economies as being [[state capitalist]] or representing [[Deformed workers' state|deformed]] or [[degenerated workers' state]]s, respectively. Within the socialist movement, there is criticism towards the use of the term socialist states in relation to countries such as [[China]] and previously of Soviet Union and Eastern and Central European states before what some term the \"[[Revolutions of 1989|collapse of Stalinism]]\" in 1989.<ref>Committee for a Workers' International (June 1992).

In particular, some Trotskyist schools call those countries degenerated workers' states to contrast them with proper socialism (i.e. workers' states) while other Trotskyist schools call them state capitalist to emphasize the lack of true socialism and presence of defining capitalist characteristics (wage labor, commodity production and bureaucratic control over workers).\n\n=== In Germany ===\n{{main|State Socialism (Germany)}}\n[[Otto von Bismarck]] implemented a set of social programs between 1883 and 1889 following his [[anti-socialist laws]], partly as remedial measures to appease the working class and detract support for the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD). Bismarck's biographer [[A. J. P. Taylor]] said: \"It would be unfair to say that Bismarck took up social welfare solely to weaken the Social Democrats; he had had it in mind for a long time, and believed in it deeply. But as usual he acted on his beliefs at the exact moment when they served a practical need\".<ref>Taylor, A. J. P. (1955). ''Bismarck. The Man and the Statesman''. London: Hamish Hamilton. p. 202. \"Since he could not shake the Centre, he would win over the Social Democrats\u2014not certainly by appealing to their leaders, whom he was persecuting and sending to prison, but by a constructive social programme, which he hoped would detach the working-class voters from the Social Democratic party. It would be unfair to say that Bismarck took up social welfare solely to weaken the Social Democrats; he had had it in mind for a long time, and believed in it deeply. But as usual he acted on his beliefs at the exact moment when they served a practical need. challenge drove him forward. He first avowed his social programme when Bebel taunted him with his old friendship with Lassalle. He answered by calling himself a Socialist, indeed a more practical Socialist than the Social Democrats; and he provocatively rejoiced in echoing Frederick the Great's wish to be le ''roi des guex'', king of the poor. Richter, the Progressive leader, called Bismarck's proposals 'not Socialistic, but Communistic'. The proposal was merely that part of the cost of Socials Insurance should be borne by the state; and nowadays Bismarck seems the progressive, Richter the unenlightened reactionary\".</ref> When a reference was made to his friendship with [[Ferdinand Lassalle]] (a nationalist and state-oriented socialist), Bismarck said that he was a more practical socialist than the Social Democrats.<ref>Taylor, A. J. P. (1955). ''Bismarck. The Man and the Statesman''. London: Hamish Hamilton. p. 202.</ref> These policies were informally referred to as State Socialism by liberal and conservative opponents and the term was later adopted by supporters of the programs in a further attempt to detract the working class from the SPD, with the goal of making the working class content with a nationalist-oriented capitalist [[welfare state]].<ref>Von Bismarck, Otto (15 March 1884).

They use the term state socialism in contrast with their own form of socialism which involves either [[collective ownership]] (in the form of [[worker cooperative]]s) or [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]] without [[Central planning|centralized state planning]]. Those libertarian socialists believe there is no need for a state in a socialist system because there would be no class to suppress and no need for an institution based on coercion and therefore regard the state being a remnant of capitalism.<ref name=\"Schumpeter 2008\"/> Most hold that [[statism]] is itself antithetical to true socialism, the goal of which is the eyes of socialists such as [[William Morris]], who wrote as follows in a ''Commonweal'' article: \"State Socialism? \u2014 I don't agree with it; in fact I think the two words contradict one another, and that it is the business of Socialism to destroy the State and put Free Society in its place\".<ref>William Morris (17 May 1890).

The TUNS School of Computer Science was merged with Dalhousie's Computer Science division (which had previously been a part of the Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science) following the 1997 amalgamation to become the [[Faculty of Computer Science, Dalhousie University|Faculty of Computer Science]].\n\nIn honour of Dr. Sexton, Dalhousie University has named the former TUNS campus the '''Sexton Campus'''.  There are also two buildings and a prestigious scholarship named after Dr. Sexton.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[T-Room]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Dalhousie University}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Technical University Of Nova Scotia}}\n[[Category:Dalhousie University]]\n[[Category:Defunct universities and colleges in Canada]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1907]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions disestablished in 1997]]\n[[Category:Engineering universities and colleges in Canada]]\n[[Category:Architecture schools in Canada]]\n[[Category:Modernist architecture in Canada]]\n[[Category:Universities and colleges in Halifax, Nova Scotia]]\n[[Category:1907 establishments in Nova Scotia]]\n[[Category:1997 disestablishments in Nova Scotia]]\n", "name_user": "Jonahrapp", "label": "safe", "comment": "reworded, was awkward before", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_University_of_Nova_Scotia"}

{"title_page": "Badan Standardisasi Nasional", "text_new": "{{2p|date=November 2019}}{{Advert|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe '''National Standardization Body''' of Indonesia ({{lang-id|Badan Nasional Standardisasi}}, BSN) is the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) member body for [[Indonesia]].\n'''Badan''' '''Standardisasi''' '''Nasional''' is a non-ministerial Indonesian government agency with the main task of carrying out governmental tasks in the field of [[standardization]] and [[conformity assessment]] in Indonesia. \n\n=='''Tasks'''==\nThe following are the main tasks of BSN:\n#Facilitating stakeholders in developing and maintaining SNI. The process is carried out by the SNI Formulation Technical Committee consisting of representatives from producers, consumers, experts / universities, and the government. Determination of SNI is carried out by the Head of BSN through the Decree of the Head of BSN.\n#Actively involved in various International Organizations such as ISO, IEC, CAC, APEC, APLAC, ILAC, PAC, ASEAN, and so on. Active participation of BSN can be in the form of attending international standard formulation sessions in order to fight for the interests of Indonesia, as well as hosting the session / hosting.\n#As the secretariat of the National Accreditation Committee (KAN), which continues to develop accreditation and certification schemes and fight for mutual recognition internationally, allowing the results of certification and laboratory tests conducted by the Indonesian Conformity Assessment Agency to be recognized worldwide.\n#Encouraging the central government, regional governments, associations, industry, and universities to participate actively in developing and promoting SNI. The efforts of BSN to encourage stakeholders to jointly conduct standardization and conformity assessment activities, are formally formulated through the signing of the Cooperation Text (MOU).\n#Empowering business practitioners to implement SNI with various incentive and promotion programs as well as SNI Award for consistent and excellent business practitioners in applying SNI\n#Conducting research and testing of SNI products in the market, of which the results can be inputs for relevant Ministries that have the capacity to be market supervisors. The research activities conducted by BSN can also be included for SNI development and maintenance activities.\n#Providing standard information and sales services, both SNI and international standards\n#Organizing National Standards of Measurement Unit that enable metrological activities in Indonesia to be recognized by the world. [1]\n\n=='''Function'''==\n#Assessment and formulation of national policies in the field of national standardization;\n#Coordination of functional activities in implementing BSN tasks;\n#Facilitating and fostering the activities of government agencies in the field of national standardization;\n#Carrying out domestic and international cooperation activities in the field of standardization, and;\n#Implementation of guidance and general administrative services in the fields of general planning, administration, organization and governance, staffing, finance, filing, coding, equipment and household.\n\n=='''Authority'''==\nIn carrying out these functions, BSN has the authority of:\n\n#Macro national planning in the field;\n#Formulation of policies in its field to support macro development;\n#Determination of information systems in their fields;\n#Other authorities in accordance with the provisions of the applicable laws and regulations, namely:\n##formulation and implementation of certain policies in the field of national standardization;\n##formulation and stipulation of accreditation system policy of certification bodies, inspection bodies and laboratories;\n##stipulation of Indonesian National Standard (SNI);\n##conducting research and development in its fields;\n##organizing education and training in its fields.\n\n=='''History'''==\nThe establishment of BSN is inseparable from the long history of standardization in Indonesia, the development and application of standards began from the Dutch and Japanese colonial times, until after the independence proclamation which declared Indonesia to be officially sovereign. Standardization was used as a means of supporting colonial economic activities so that it could run smoothly. The official institution related to standardization activities began in 1928 in the Dutch East Indies, with the establishment of the Stichting Fonds voor de Normalisatie in Nederlands Indie (Normalization Foundation in the Indies) and the Normalization Road (Normalization Council) located in Bandung, Indonesia. Dutch engineers who were mostly civil engineers began to set standards for building materials, transportation equipment followed by electrical installation standards and requirements for external lines. During World War II and during the Japanese occupation (1942-1945) we could consider that formal standardization activities were halted. On August 17, 1945 Indonesia's independence was proclaimed. Indonesia immediately formed a government and planned development to improve the standard of living and welfare of the people towards equality with other countries.\n\nIn 1951 the amendment to the \"Raad Normalization\" statute was formed and the Indonesian Normalization Fund Foundation (YDNI) was formed. In 1955 YDNI represented Indonesia as a member of the ISO international standards organization and in 1966 YDNI successfully represented Indonesia as a member of the International Electrotechnical Commission / IEC.\n\nIn the field of standardization Law No. 10 of 1961 known as the \"Goods Act\". It turns out that this law has not been able to be a means of managing overall standardization activities. At that time, standardization activities were still sectoral, carried out by various departments, including the Ministry of Industry (Indonesian Industrial Standards), the Ministry of Trade (Trade Standards), the Ministry of Public Works (Indonesian Construction and Building Standards), the Ministry of Agriculture (Indonesian-Agriculture Agricultural Standards; Indonesian Agricultural Standards-Animal Husbandry), Ministry of Forestry (Indonesian Forestry Standards), as well as several government institutions / agencies.\n\nThe government began to place standardization as a strategic function in supporting national development. In 1973, the \"National System Development for Standardization\" program was established as a priority. In 1976, the National Standardization System Preparation Committee was formed. In 1984, with the Decree of the President of the Republic of Indonesia the National Standardization Board (DSN) was formed with the main task of establishing standardization policies, coordinating and fostering cooperation in the field of national standardization. The Chairperson of the National Standardization Board is held by the State Minister for Research and Technology, Prof. Dr. Ing. H. Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie, FREng.\n\nThrough the struggle of the previous leadership, Alm. Ir. Herudi Kartowisastro, on March 27, 1997, the government dissolved the DSN which subsequently changed to the National Standardization Body. BSN itself is a Non-Ministry Government Institution (LPNK) that is given the task by the government to foster and coordinate all standardization and conformity assessment activities in Indonesia. The establishment of BSN was based on Presidential Decree No. 13 of 1997 perfected by Presidential Decree No. 166 of 2000 concerning Position, Duties, Functions, Authority, Organizational Structure and Work Procedures of Non-Departmental Government Institutions as amended several times, and the most recent by Presidential Decree No. 4 of 2018, concerning the National Standardization Agency.\n\nIn order to enhance the development of the Indonesian National Standard (SNI), the government established Government Regulation No. 102 of 2000 concerning National Standardization. On September 14, 2014, Law No. 20 of 2014 concerning Standardization and Conformity Assessment was stipulated. With the existence of this Law, the government will further strengthen the existence and role of BSN in the development process in Indonesia both in the context of physical development, efficient management of natural resources, and the development of highly competitive Indonesian people.\nWelcoming the era of globalization which demands high competitiveness, as well as the implementation of Law No. 20 of 2014, the BSN successfully reorganized itself to include a new structure namely the Deputy for the National Standard Measuring Unit (SNSU) in 2018. With the Deputy, BSN was more able to optimally implement the quality infrastructure (Standardization, Conformity Assessment, Metrology) in order to actualize a system that allows products to meet the quality and requirements of Safety, Security, Health, and Environmental Sustainability (K3L); life can be more comfortable, safe and orderly; the dignity of the nation will be lifted because Indonesia can compete more internationally. \n\n=='''Organization'''==\nThe National Standardization Agency Organization consists of the Chairman, Main Secretariat, Deputy for Standards Development, Deputy for Application of Standards and Conformity Assessment, Deputy for Accreditation, Deputy for National Standards for Measuring Units, Inspectorates, Research and Development Center for Human Resources, and Data and Systems Center Information.\n\n==='''Chairman of BSN'''=== \nThe Chairman of BSN is under and directly responsible to the President of the Republic of Indonesia with the task of: \n#Leading the BSN in accordance with the legislation in force; \n#Preparing national policies and general policies in accordance with the duties of BSN; \n#Establishing technical policies for the tasks implementation of BSN as its responsibility; \n#Fostering and carrying out cooperation with other agencies and organizations.\n\n===='''Main Secretariat'''==== \nThe Main Secretariat has the task of carrying out coordination of the implementation of tasks, coaching, and providing administrative support to all organizational units within the BSN.

The process is carried out by the SNI Formulation Technical Committee consisting of representatives from producers, consumers, experts / universities, and the government. Determination of SNI is carried out by the Head of BSN through the Decree of the Head of BSN.\n#Actively involved in various International Organizations such as ISO, IEC, CAC, APEC, APLAC, ILAC, PAC, ASEAN, and so on. Active participation of BSN can be in the form of attending international standard formulation sessions in order to fight for the interests of Indonesia, as well as hosting the session / hosting.\n#As the secretariat of the National Accreditation Committee (KAN), which continues to develop accreditation and certification schemes and fight for mutual recognition internationally, allowing the results of certification and laboratory tests conducted by the Indonesian Conformity Assessment Agency to be recognized worldwide.\n#Encouraging the central government, regional governments, associations, industry, and universities to participate actively in developing and promoting SNI. The efforts of BSN to encourage stakeholders to jointly conduct standardization and conformity assessment activities, are formally formulated through the signing of the Cooperation Text (MOU).\n#Empowering business practitioners to implement SNI with various incentive and promotion programs as well as SNI Award for consistent and excellent business practitioners in applying SNI\n#Conducting research and testing of SNI products in the market, of which the results can be inputs for relevant Ministries that have the capacity to be market supervisors. The research activities conducted by BSN can also be included for SNI development and maintenance activities.\n#Providing standard information and sales services, both SNI and international standards\n#Organizing National Standards of Measurement Unit that enable metrological activities in Indonesia to be recognized by the world. [1]\n\n=='''Function'''==\n#Assessment and formulation of national policies in the field of national standardization;\n#Coordination of functional activities in implementing BSN tasks;\n#Facilitating and fostering the activities of government agencies in the field of national standardization;\n#Carrying out domestic and international cooperation activities in the field of standardization, and;\n#Implementation of guidance and general administrative services in the fields of general planning, administration, organization and governance, staffing, finance, filing, coding, equipment and household.\n\n=='''Authority'''==\nIn carrying out these functions, BSN has the authority of:\n\n#Macro national planning in the field;\n#Formulation of policies in its field to support macro development;\n#Determination of information systems in their fields;\n#Other authorities in accordance with the provisions of the applicable laws and regulations, namely:\n##formulation and implementation of certain policies in the field of national standardization;\n##formulation and stipulation of accreditation system policy of certification bodies, inspection bodies and laboratories;\n##stipulation of Indonesian National Standard (SNI);\n##conducting research and development in its fields;\n##organizing education and training in its fields.\n\n=='''History'''==\nThe establishment of BSN is inseparable from the long history of standardization in Indonesia, the development and application of standards began from the Dutch and Japanese colonial times, until after the independence proclamation which declared Indonesia to be officially sovereign. Standardization was used as a means of supporting colonial economic activities so that it could run smoothly. The official institution related to standardization activities began in 1928 in the Dutch East Indies, with the establishment of the Stichting Fonds voor de Normalisatie in Nederlands Indie (Normalization Foundation in the Indies) and the Normalization Road (Normalization Council) located in Bandung, Indonesia. Dutch engineers who were mostly civil engineers began to set standards for building materials, transportation equipment followed by electrical installation standards and requirements for external lines. During World War II and during the Japanese occupation (1942-1945) we could consider that formal standardization activities were halted. On August 17, 1945 Indonesia's independence was proclaimed. Indonesia immediately formed a government and planned development to improve the standard of living and welfare of the people towards equality with other countries.\n\nIn 1951 the amendment to the \"Raad Normalization\" statute was formed and the Indonesian Normalization Fund Foundation (YDNI) was formed. In 1955 YDNI represented Indonesia as a member of the ISO international standards organization and in 1966 YDNI successfully represented Indonesia as a member of the International Electrotechnical Commission / IEC.\n\nIn the field of standardization Law No. 10 of 1961 known as the \"Goods Act\". It turns out that this law has not been able to be a means of managing overall standardization activities. At that time, standardization activities were still sectoral, carried out by various departments, including the Ministry of Industry (Indonesian Industrial Standards), the Ministry of Trade (Trade Standards), the Ministry of Public Works (Indonesian Construction and Building Standards), the Ministry of Agriculture (Indonesian-Agriculture Agricultural Standards; Indonesian Agricultural Standards-Animal Husbandry), Ministry of Forestry (Indonesian Forestry Standards), as well as several government institutions / agencies.\n\nThe government began to place standardization as a strategic function in supporting national development. In 1973, the \"National System Development for Standardization\" program was established as a priority. In 1976, the National Standardization System Preparation Committee was formed. In 1984, with the Decree of the President of the Republic of Indonesia the National Standardization Board (DSN) was formed with the main task of establishing standardization policies, coordinating and fostering cooperation in the field of national standardization. The Chairperson of the National Standardization Board is held by the State Minister for Research and Technology, Prof. Dr. Ing. H. Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie, FREng.\n\nThrough the struggle of the previous leadership, Alm. Ir. Herudi Kartowisastro, on March 27, 1997, the government dissolved the DSN which subsequently changed to the National Standardization Body. BSN itself is a Non-Ministry Government Institution (LPNK) that is given the task by the government to foster and coordinate all standardization and conformity assessment activities in Indonesia. The establishment of BSN was based on Presidential Decree No. 13 of 1997 perfected by Presidential Decree No. 166 of 2000 concerning Position, Duties, Functions, Authority, Organizational Structure and Work Procedures of Non-Departmental Government Institutions as amended several times, and the most recent by Presidential Decree No. 4 of 2018, concerning the National Standardization Agency.\n\nIn order to enhance the development of the Indonesian National Standard (SNI), the government established Government Regulation No. 102 of 2000 concerning National Standardization. On September 14, 2014, Law No. 20 of 2014 concerning Standardization and Conformity Assessment was stipulated. With the existence of this Law, the government will further strengthen the existence and role of BSN in the development process in Indonesia both in the context of physical development, efficient management of natural resources, and the development of highly competitive Indonesian people.\nWelcoming the era of globalization which demands high competitiveness, as well as the implementation of Law No. 20 of 2014, the BSN successfully reorganized itself to include a new structure namely the Deputy for the National Standard Measuring Unit (SNSU) in 2018. With the Deputy, BSN was more able to optimally implement the quality infrastructure (Standardization, Conformity Assessment, Metrology) in order to actualize a system that allows products to meet the quality and requirements of Safety, Security, Health, and Environmental Sustainability (K3L); life can be more comfortable, safe and orderly; the dignity of the nation will be lifted because Indonesia can compete more internationally. \n\n=='''Organization'''==\nThe National Standardization Agency Organization consists of the Chairman, Main Secretariat, Deputy for Standards Development, Deputy for Application of Standards and Conformity Assessment, Deputy for Accreditation, Deputy for National Standards for Measuring Units, Inspectorates, Research and Development Center for Human Resources, and Data and Systems Center Information.\n\n==='''Chairman of BSN'''=== \nThe Chairman of BSN is under and directly responsible to the President of the Republic of Indonesia with the task of: \n#Leading the BSN in accordance with the legislation in force; \n#Preparing national policies and general policies in accordance with the duties of BSN; \n#Establishing technical policies for the tasks implementation of BSN as its responsibility; \n#Fostering and carrying out cooperation with other agencies and organizations.\n\n===='''Main Secretariat'''==== \nThe Main Secretariat has the task of carrying out coordination of the implementation of tasks, coaching, and providing administrative support to all organizational units within the BSN.
