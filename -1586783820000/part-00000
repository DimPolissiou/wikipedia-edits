Lamar coach  [[Holly Bruder]] did not want to start the decisive game because of the threatening weather, but tournament director Dave King opted to have the game played, since it was the last day that had been scheduled for the tournament.

Lamar coach  [[Holly Bruder]] did not want to start the decisive game because of the threatening weather, but tournament director Dave King opted to have the game played, since it was the last day that had been scheduled for the tournament. In the second Finals game, Lamar scored four runs in the top half of the sixth inning to take a 5\u20133 lead. With two outs in the bottom of the inning, the rains resumed, soaking the field and making it unplayable.

{"title_page": "Middle-earth in film", "text_new": "[[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novels ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', set in [[Middle-earth]], have been the subject of various film adaptations. There were many early failed attempts to bring the fictional universe to life in screen, some even rejected by the author himself, who was skeptical of the prospects of an adaptation. While animated and [[Sagan om ringen (1971 film)|live-action shorts]] were made off of Tolkien in 1967 and 1971, the first commercial depiction of the book onscreen was in an  [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|animated TV special in 1977]]. In 1978 the first big screen adaptation of the fictional setting was introduced in the animated ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.  \n\nThe rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt films]] before being sold perpetually to [[United Artists]], who then partially passed them to [[Fantasy Films|Fantasy films]]. During this time, filmmakers who attempted to adapt Tolkien's works include [[William L. Snyder|William Snyder]], [[Peter Shaffer]], [[John Boorman]], [[Ralph Bakshi]], [[Peter Jackson]] and [[Guillermo del Toro|Guillermo Del Toro]]. Other filmmakers and producers who were interested in an adaptation included [[Walt Disney]], [[Forrest J Ackerman|Forrest Ackerman]], [[Denis O'Bell|Denis O'Dell]] (who contacted [[David Lean]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]] to direct) and [[Heinz Edelmann]]. \n\n[[New Line Cinema]] released the first part of director [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]] in 2001 as part of a trilogy and several actors and roles were introduced once again in a trilogy in [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]]. In 2017, Amazon co-operated with New Line to acquire the TV rights to adapt a new prequel show set in a period glimpsed during a flashback in ''The Lord of the Rings'' films. \n\nCollectively, the New Line franchise has received a record 37 [[Academy Award]] nominations, winning 17, and three special awards, also a record. Along with [[The Godfather trilogy|''The Godfather'' trilogy]], it is one of two film series to date to have received three [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture nominations]]. The third film in Peter Jackson's trilogy, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', was the first and, as of 2020, only high-fantasy film to win Best Picture, as well as the second sequel to do so after ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''. Along with ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' and ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' holds the record for Academy Awards won by a single film (not bringing into account two Technical Achievement Awards given to its crew) and is the only one of the three films to win every category for which it was nominated.\n\nThere have also been a biopic of Tolkien's, as well as [[fan film]]s of Middle-earth such as ''[[The Hunt for Gollum]]'' and ''[[Born of Hope]]'', which were uploaded to YouTube on May 8, 2009 and December 11, 2009 respectively.\n\n==Early attempts==\nTolkien watched films,<ref name=\":13\" /> but always had a mistrust of the medium<ref name=\":14\" /> and of his books' suitability for dramatization.<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/04/19/jrr-tolkien-film-my-books-its-easier-to-film-the-odyssey/|title=JRR Tolkien: 'Film my books?

An animator of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] sent a memo suggesting that elements of ''The Hobbit'' and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring]]'' cycle could be incorporated into the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winning animated anthology film, ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=99-108}}</ref> According to animator [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], Walt Disney wanted to make a ''Lord of the Rings'' feature in the 1950s, but his storyboard artists deemed it too complex, lengthy and scary for a Disney feature.<ref name=\":0\" /> These attempts were the basis of the rumour (perpetuated later by [[Ralph Bakshi]]) that Disney held the rights to Tolkien's works before [[United Artists]], which is untrue. On these rumours it was later said in the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] that Disney deemed that Tolkien's writings \"lacked the kind of humor that audiences expect from Disney animation\u201d and that \u201cany attempt to alter story to inject such humor might result in bad will and vocal resentment among Tolkien devotees.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1972, Disney storyman [[Vance Gerry]] pitched an animated adaptation dedicated to ''The Hobbit''. He illustrated [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], and produced a synopsis of the work, prefacing that the Disney company had \u201cnever done a cartoon with this much story\u201d, admitting that \u201cthere are far more incidents in the story than we could ever use\u201d and that \u201cmany sections are too frightening for our purposes.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://66.media.tumblr.com/cc128fe690496073b8ff9852fcdbfad0/tumblr_os2m0nY2O61vi7r4lo4_1280.jpg|title=The Hobbit, 11/10/1972|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> He suggested cutting the scarier sequences, which would possibly include the spiders. The pitch was never green-lit, and the project died until 1996.\n\n=== Forrest J. Ackerman ===\nIn June 1956, animator [[Al Brodax]] reached out to Tolkien's publisher's with a proposal for an animated film adaptation of his works, appearantly of ''The Lord of the Rings''. Tolkien was cautiously interested, saying he should \"welcome the idea\" of a film, \"quite apart from the glint of money\",<ref name=\":2\" /> but nothing came out of it.\n\nAt the end of the year, Tolkien was approached by American agent [[Forrest J. Ackerman]], who had an interest in producing an animated film based on Tolkien's work for am amateur screenwriter and acquaintance called Morton Grady Zimmerman. Ackerman, a literary agent and genre fan, wanted to get into producing films with this project. \n\nAckerman showed Tolkien artwork by [[Ron Cobb]] and pitched Zimmerman's story synopsis, according to which the story would be condensed to a three-hour animated film, combined with miniature photography and live-action shot around [[California]], and would be presented with two intermissions.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{ME-ref|letters|#261}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Hughes|first=David|title=Tales From Development Hell (New Updated Edition): The Greatest Movies Never Made?|publisher=Titan|year=2012|isbn=9780857687319|location=|pages=8}}</ref> Tolkien already had objections at this phase \u2013 [[Lothl\u00f3rien|Lothlorien]] was described to him as a fairy-castle, and the story had been greatly condensed<ref name=\":3\" /> \u2013 but he liked the concept art, which he describes as akin to [[Arthur Rackham]]<ref>{{ME-ref|letters|#17}}</ref> as opposed to Walt Disney, whom he loathed. He delayed in reviewing the synopsis until urged by Unwin, and once he delivered his initial notes to Ackerman, the agent was granted a six-month option on the book, if he could find a producer to finance the project. In looking for a studio, he intended to make the film with [[American International Pictures]], but president James Nicholson declined, as did other studio heads.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTolkien was sent a 55-page<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bogstad|first=Janice M.

He complained of divergence from not only the tone of the book (such as a \"fairy-tale\" depiction of [[Lothl\u00f3rien]], as well as elements cut \"upon which [the book's] characteristic and peculiar tone principally depends\") but also the character representation (such as Sam leaving Frodo to [[Shelob]] and going on to [[Mount Doom]] alone). In addition, he took issue with dialogue changes as regards to the \"style and sentiment\" of characters, and with intercutting between the storylines of Frodo and Aragorn. He suggested eliminating the battle of [[Helm's Deep]] to better emphasize the defense of [[Minas Tirith]], as well as cutting characters out instead of diminishing their roles. Tolkien protested against added \"incantations, blue lights, and some irrelevant magic\" and \"a preference for fights\".<ref name=\"Screenplays\">{{cite web|url=http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|title=Three Rings for Hollywood: Scripts for The Lord of the Rings by Zimmerman, Boorman, and Beagle|author=Croft, Janet B.|date=2004-04-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903220627/http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|archivedate=2006-09-03|accessdate=2006-11-29}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Tolkien didn't wish to kill the project \"which I think promised well on the pictorial side.\"<ref name=\":20\">{{Cite book|last=Hammond|first=Wayne G.|title=The J.R.R.

Tolkien received a suggestion in fan-mail to have ''The Hobbit'' adapted to a serial in four intervals, which was declined by [[Rayner Unwin]] for its potential to \"incarcerate us in the local odeons for nine or ten hours.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Rembrandt films ===\nIn 1961, [[William L. Snyder]] negotiated the rights to adapt ''The Hobbit'' to animation. His company, Rembrandt films, had won multiple Oscars for animated shorts, and he contacted Tolkien's agent for the rights to ''The Hobbit.'' Unlike Ackerman, Snyder could raise sufficient funds for Tolkien and Unwin to enter negotiations to lease ''The Hobbit'' to him for five years, and give him creative freedom in adapting the book in exchange for a precentage off of the revenue. Due to a mishap in the publishing of the first edition of ''The Hobbit'' (and, later on, ''The Lord of the Rings'') the books were public domain in the US, which gave Snyder leverage to renegotiate the conditions of the lease. Tolkien and Unwin only received a $15,000 advance.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite book|last=Lee|first=Stuart D.|title=A Companion to J. R. R. Tolkien|publisher=Wiley|year=2020|isbn=9781119656029|location=|pages=518-521}}</ref> While Tolkien was aware that Snyder was \"sure to perpetrate [...] many objectionable things\",<ref name=\":0\" /> he agreed to lease the rights to the producer in 1962. In 1964 Tolkien was still wondering if a film will be made, and what it will be like, and Snyder reported that a script was being finalized.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSnyder commissioned cartoonist [[Gene Deitch]] to write a script for a feature-length ''Hobbit'' cartoon, during which he took significant liberties with the text, inserting a princess of Dale who undertakes the Quest and ends up married to Bilbo. Since ''The Lord of the Rings'' wasn't published in the US at the time, Deitch only became aware of it later on,<ref name=\":0\" /> and incorporated the concept of the Ring of Power into the Gollum (or Goloom, as he's called in the piece) episode later in the writing, making a sequel based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' possible.\n\nWhen a deal with [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]] fell through and the rights we due to expire, Snyder commissioned Deitch to quickly make a condensed film that would fulfill the requirements of the contract. The deal was for an animated, colour film but didn't specify length, and so Deitch had to compress the story into [[The Hobbit (1966 film)|an animated short]], which was screened in [[New York City|New York]] in 1967. This prolonged Snyder's lease on the rights, which Snyder was now aware were highly prized.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch's film technically constitues the first onscreen depiction of any of Tolkien's works, but it amounts to little more than a narrated picture-book, with a narrator telling the short story (twelve minutes in length) over a series of animation stills. The film was only exhibited once in a projection room at New York to around twelve spectactors who were pulled from the street, provided the admission money by the exhibitors so that they may sign a document stating that they payed to see a colour film based on ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch recalled that the extended lease extended to the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'', and that the rights to both novels were sold back Tolkien for a higher price.<ref name=\"Deitch\">{{cite web|url=http://genedeitchcredits.com/roll-the-credits-01/40-william-l-snyder/|title=William L.

Carole Ward suggested adapting ''The Lord of the Rings'' for TV in 1964, to air on the newly-launched [[BBC Two|BBC2]]. [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] launched a competing offer, according to which the book will be adapted via puppetry, which Tolkien found contemptous. Another attempt at purchasing the TV rights was made in 1968, which would put it concurrently with the cinema rights being sold to United Artists. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond.|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing.|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=65-67}}</ref>\n\n=== United Artists ===\nProducer [[Samuel Gelfman]] first inquired about the rights to the books in 1959. The idea of live-action fantasy became fashionable in the early 1960s due to the success of [[Ray Harryhausen]]'s Stop-motion productions.

United Artists were the studio behind several of the lucrative widescreen epics of the decade. In the 1960s, long widescreen epics (presented as a [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow]] with an intermission) still proved successful, but few sequels were made in that genre, and therefore Katzka-Bernie commissioned Sir [[Peter Shaffer]] to write a treatment for a single, three-hour film adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings'', which was deemed \"elegant\",<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://thequietus.com/articles/25681-ralph-bakshi-the-lord-of-the-rings-animation-review-anniversary|title=The Lord of the Rings Animation Review Anniversary|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> keeping ''The Hobbit'' in mind as a potential prequel. Merchandizing was of little concern at the time, but the rights to make profit off of such productions was included in the contract.\n\nNegotiations extended until 1969, when the rights were sold off for $250,000 (adjusted for inflation, the modern equivalent is about $1.5 million) and 7.5% of gross receipts, minus expenses, to be paid to Tolkien. Shaffer's script never got off of the ground, but the rights were sold to United Artists in perpetuity, including the option to pass the rights to another studio. [[Arlo Guthrie]] pitched an animated feature to the studio, but UA were adamant they wanted the film to be live-action, although the contract options an animated film.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStanley Unwin suggested that Tolkien's inexperience in dealing with movie producers led to the generous conditions of the contract.<ref name=\":16\" /> Now elderly, Tolkien's desire to set-up a trust fund for his grandchildren could indicate that he might not have expected to live and see the resulting film, and wanted to use the profits to take care of his ailing wife.<ref name=\":0\" /> The increase in income tax rates at the time decreased Tolkien's profits off of book sales, and he expected a fall-off in the sales in years to come.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/focus-tolkien-sold-film-rights-to-lord-of-the-rings-to-avoid-taxman-ttwv6qh3rlv|title=Focus: Tolkien sold film rights to Lord of the Rings to avoid taxman|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In 1968, Tolkien expressed skepticism about adapting his works to film, saying \"its easier to film the Odyssey\"<ref name=\":15\" />, although he reportedly exhibited cautious enthusiasm in the conversations with Gelfman and in a later correspondence with John Boorman. \n\n==== Apple films ====\nDuring this period, [[The Beatles]] were on a three-picture deal with United Artists. Their previous two features, ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'', were directed by [[Richard Lester]] and were financially successful. When it became clear that the animated [[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]] would not count as part of this deal, Denis O'Dell (head of the Beatles' [[Apple Films]]) entered negotiations for their third film. He came up with the idea of a ''Lord of the Rings'' \"multimedia musical extravaganza\",<ref name=\":11\" /> starring the Beatles as the four Hobbits. He eventually learned that UA themselves were in negotiations for the rights.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=O'Dell|first=Dennis|title=At the Apple's core: the Beatles from the inside|publisher=Peter Owen Limited|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=92-105}}</ref>\n\nIn conversation with studio heads [[David V. Picker|David]] and Arnold Picker, it was decided that [[Richard Lester]] wasn't up for such an undertaking and a \"star director\" was required. O'Dell shortlisted Sir [[David Lean]] (with his writer at-the-time, [[Robert Bolt]]), [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]]. Lean and Kubrick, in particular, had experience in adapting literary works into lucrative widescreen epics, while Antonioni recently made his breakout English-language film in ''[[Blowup]]''.\n\nO'Dell phoned Lean once he got back to the hotel. Lean was a fan of ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and his brother [[Edward Tangye Lean|Tangye]] was an acquaintance of Tolkien's. He was interested, but busy with preproduction on ''[[Ryan's Daughter]]''. \"Its a very interesting idea, Denis. Unfortunately I'm tied up at the moment with a little love story I'm going to do out here.\u201d<ref name=\":4\" /> Another project Lean had recently declined in favour of ''Ryan's Daughter'' was a [[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]] biopic, which Lean first pitched in 1958. When Bolt pulled out in order to stay on Lean's film, he used a rhetoric similar to what Lean used to turn down O'Dell. In 1972, Lean and Bolt were in conversations to adapt [[Dune (novel)#Early stalled attempts|''Dune'']], but declined.<ref>Lean and Bolt were approached with a treatment written by [[Robert Greenhut|Bob Greenhut]]. A similarly labyrinthine project, Dune passed to [[Rospo Pallenberg]], [[Alejandro Jodorowsky|Alejandro Jodorowski]], [[Ridley Scott]], [[Dune (1984 film)|David Lynch]] (who released a film adaptation in 1984), [[Frank Herbert's Dune|John Harrison]] (who directed a TV miniseries in 2000), [[Peter Berg]], [[Pierre Morel]] and finally to [[Denis Villeneuve|Denis Villenueve]].\n\n\n</ref>\n\nDenis next contacted Kubrick, who hadn't read the books, but was sent copies to read during the voyage back the UK. Meanwhile, O'Dell left to [[India]] to visit the Beatles, with the books in his suitcase. At the behest of [[Donovan]], who had previously been musically and cinematically interested in the books, the band divided the three volumes among themselves (Harrison was absent on the day of O'Dell's arrival) and began to think \"seriously\" about the idea.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nAccording to O'Dell, [[John Lennon|Lennon]] (reportedly the most taken with the books) fancied the role of Gandalf, but [[George Harrison|Harrison]] later recalled that John eventually wanted to swap for Frodo. Ringo wanted to play Sam, and [[Paul McCartney|McCartney]], also taken with the book, coveted Frodo. He later told Jackson that Lennon would have been Gollum, [[Ringo Starr|Ringo]] Sam and Harrison Gandalf.

Bakshi then shot character actors playing to the recording in empty soundstages, and later rotoscoped the performances.<ref name=\":8\" /> Bakshi later regretted his use of the rotoscoping technique, stating that he made a mistake by tracing the source footage rather than using it as a guide.<ref name=\"DirectorsSeries-1\">{{cite video|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9111970495147326968|title=The Directors Series: Interview with Ralph Bakshi (Part One)|date=|people=Gallagher, John A.|publisher=Google Video|location=|time=|accessdate=|format=|quote=|medium=}}</ref> Live-action footage for crowd scenes was shot in Death Valley and in Spain.<ref name=\":8\" /> To cut ballooning costs, cinematographer Timothy Galfas suggested solarizing the crowd scenes, to create a pseudo-animated look.

Although Jackson and Walsh re-read ''The Hobbit'' and even commissioned their workshop at WETA for some concept art, the rights to ''The Hobbit'' proved difficult because they were split between Zaentz and United Artists. [[Harvey Weinstein]] tried to purchase them from the studio, but was unsuccessful. \n\nIt was decided to move ahead with two ''Lord of the Rings'' films, leaving ''The Hobbit'' as a possible prequel. While filming, Jackson told Elijah Wood he wasn't interested in directing ''The Hobbit'', but during post-production on ''The Two Towers'', spoke more enthusiastically of it with composer Howard Shore.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rhino.com/article/interview-howard-shore-the-lord-of-the-rings|title=INTERVIEW: Howard Shore (\u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d)|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Jackson also later made joking remarks about TV spinoff shows.<ref>The Two Towers: Director's Commentary</ref>\n===''The Lord of the Rings''===\n{{Main article|The Lord of the Rings (film series)}}\nEventually, with Miramax owner [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] becoming increasingly uneasy with the sheer scope of the proposed project, the Weinsteins suggested reducing the project to a single, two-hour  film. Jackson was willing to consider this, if the film was to be around four hours in length, but Miramax limited it to two hours, and offered suggestions in order to achieve this, namely amalgamating Gondor and Rohan. They contacted [[Hossein Amini]] to rewrite and threatened to get [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] or [[Quentin Tarantino]] to direct.\n\nJackson refused, and was given the opportunity to find another studio to take over. In 1999, New Line Cinema assumed production responsibility (while Miramax executives [[Bob Weinstein]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] retained on-screen credits as executive producers). The three films were shot simultaneously. They featured extensive [[computer-generated imagery]], including major battle scenes utilizing the \"[[Massive (software)|Massive]]\" software program. The first film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' was released on December 19, 2001, the second film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]'' on December 18, 2002 and the third film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]'' worldwide on December 17, 2003.

New Line suggested [[Sam Raimi]] to direct, but in 2008, Guillermo Del Toro was chosen to direct a two-film adaptation of The Hobbit, produced by Jackson and co-written with Walsh, Boyens and Del Toro. Time constraints caused Del Toro to bow out, and Jackson stepped-in to direct.

1977]]\n[[Category:Adaptations of works by J. R. R. Tolkien|Films]]\n[[Category:Middle-earth films| ]]\n", "text_old": "[[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novels ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', set in [[Middle-earth]], have been the subject of various film adaptations. There were many early failed attempts to bring the fictional universe to life in screen, some even rejected by the author himself, who was skeptical of the prospects of an adaptation. While animated and [[Sagan om ringen (1971 film)|live-action shorts]] were made off of Tolkien in 1967 and 1971, the first commercial depiction of the book onscreen was in an  [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|animated TV special in 1977]]. In 1978 the first big screen adaptation of the fictional setting was introduced in the animated ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.  \n\nThe rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt films]] before being sold perpetually to [[United Artists]], who then partially passed them to [[Fantasy Films|Fantasy films]]. During this time, filmmakers who attempted to adapt Tolkien's works include [[William L. Snyder|William Snyder]], [[Peter Shaffer]], [[John Boorman]], [[Ralph Bakshi]], [[Peter Jackson]] and [[Guillermo del Toro|Guillermo Del Toro]]. Other filmmakers and producers who were interested in an adaptation included [[Walt Disney]], [[Forrest J Ackerman|Forrest Ackerman]], [[Denis O'Bell|Denis O'Dell]] (who contacted [[David Lean]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]] to direct) and [[Heinz Edelmann]]. \n\n[[New Line Cinema]] released the first part of director [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]] in 2001 as part of a trilogy and several actors and roles were introduced once again in a trilogy in [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]]. In 2017, Amazon co-operated with New Line to acquire the TV rights to adapt a new prequel show set in a period glimpsed during a flashback in ''The Lord of the Rings'' films. \n\nCollectively, the New Line franchise has received a record 37 [[Academy Award]] nominations, winning 17, and three special awards, also a record. Along with [[The Godfather trilogy|''The Godfather'' trilogy]], it is one of two film series to date to have received three [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture nominations]]. The third film in Peter Jackson's trilogy, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', was the first and, as of 2020, only high-fantasy film to win Best Picture, as well as the second sequel to do so after ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''. Along with ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' and ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' holds the record for Academy Awards won by a single film (not bringing into account two Technical Achievement Awards given to its crew) and is the only one of the three films to win every category for which it was nominated.\n\nThere have also been a biopic of Tolkien's, as well as [[fan film]]s of Middle-earth such as ''[[The Hunt for Gollum]]'' and ''[[Born of Hope]]'', which were uploaded to YouTube on May 8, 2009 and December 11, 2009 respectively.\n\n==Early attempts==\nTolkien watched films,<ref name=\":13\" /> but always had a mistrust of the medium<ref name=\":14\" /> and of his books' suitability for dramatization.<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/04/19/jrr-tolkien-film-my-books-its-easier-to-film-the-odyssey/|title=JRR Tolkien: 'Film my books?

An animator of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] sent a memo suggesting that elements of ''The Hobbit'' and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring]]'' cycle could be incorporated into the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winning animated anthology film, ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=99-108}}</ref> According to animator [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], Walt Disney wanted to make a ''Lord of the Rings'' feature in the 1950s, but his storyboard artists deemed it too complex, lengthy and scary for a Disney feature.<ref name=\":0\" /> These attempts were the basis of the rumour (perpetuated later by [[Ralph Bakshi]]) that Disney held the rights to Tolkien's works before [[United Artists]], which is untrue. On these rumours it was later said in the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] that Disney deemed that Tolkien's writings \"lacked the kind of humor that audiences expect from Disney animation\u201d and that \u201cany attempt to alter story to inject such humor might result in bad will and vocal resentment among Tolkien devotees.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1972, Disney storyman [[Vance Gerry]] pitched an animated adaptation dedicated to ''The Hobbit''. He illustrated [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], and produced a synopsis of the work, prefacing that the Disney company had \u201cnever done a cartoon with this much story\u201d, admitting that \u201cthere are far more incidents in the story than we could ever use\u201d and that \u201cmany sections are too frightening for our purposes.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://66.media.tumblr.com/cc128fe690496073b8ff9852fcdbfad0/tumblr_os2m0nY2O61vi7r4lo4_1280.jpg|title=The Hobbit, 11/10/1972|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> He suggested cutting the scarier sequences, which would possibly include the spiders. The pitch was never green-lit, and the project died until 1996.\n\n=== Forrest J. Ackerman ===\nIn June 1956, animator [[Al Brodax]] reached out to Tolkien's publisher's with a proposal for an animated film adaptation of his works, appearantly of ''The Lord of the Rings''. Tolkien was cautiously interested, saying he should \"welcome the idea\" of a film, \"quite apart from the glint of money\",<ref name=\":2\" /> but nothing came out of it.\n\nAt the end of the year, Tolkien was approached by American agent [[Forrest J. Ackerman]], who had an interest in producing an animated film based on Tolkien's work for am amateur screenwriter and acquaintance called Morton Grady Zimmerman. Ackerman, a literary agent and genre fan, wanted to get into producing films with this project. \n\nAckerman showed Tolkien artwork by [[Ron Cobb]] and pitched Zimmerman's story synopsis, according to which the story would be condensed to a three-hour animated film, combined with miniature photography and live-action shot around [[California]], and would be presented with two intermissions.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{ME-ref|letters|#261}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Hughes|first=David|title=Tales From Development Hell (New Updated Edition): The Greatest Movies Never Made?|publisher=Titan|year=2012|isbn=9780857687319|location=|pages=8}}</ref> Tolkien already had objections at this phase \u2013 [[Lothl\u00f3rien|Lothlorien]] was described to him as a fairy-castle, and the story had been greatly condensed<ref name=\":3\" /> \u2013 but he liked the concept art, which he describes as akin to [[Arthur Rackham]]<ref>{{ME-ref|letters|#17}}</ref> as opposed to Walt Disney, whom he loathed. He delayed in reviewing the synopsis until urged by Unwin, and once he delivered his initial notes to Ackerman, the agent was granted a six-month option on the book, if he could find a producer to finance the project. In looking for a studio, he intended to make the film with [[American International Pictures]], but president James Nicholson declined, as did other studio heads.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTolkien was sent a 55-page<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bogstad|first=Janice M.

He complained of divergence from not only the tone of the book (such as a \"fairy-tale\" depiction of [[Lothl\u00f3rien]], as well as elements cut \"upon which [the book's] characteristic and peculiar tone principally depends\") but also the character representation (such as Sam leaving Frodo to [[Shelob]] and going on to [[Mount Doom]] alone). In addition, he took issue with dialogue changes as regards to the \"style and sentiment\" of characters, and with intercutting between the storylines of Frodo and Aragorn. He suggested eliminating the battle of [[Helm's Deep]] to better emphasize the defense of [[Minas Tirith]], as well as cutting characters out instead of diminishing their roles. Tolkien protested against added \"incantations, blue lights, and some irrelevant magic\" and \"a preference for fights\".<ref name=\"Screenplays\">{{cite web|url=http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|title=Three Rings for Hollywood: Scripts for The Lord of the Rings by Zimmerman, Boorman, and Beagle|author=Croft, Janet B.|date=2004-04-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903220627/http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|archivedate=2006-09-03|accessdate=2006-11-29}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Tolkien didn't wish to kill the project \"which I think promised well on the pictorial side.\"<ref name=\":20\">{{Cite book|last=Hammond|first=Wayne G.|title=The J.R.R.

Tolkien received a suggestion in fan-mail to have ''The Hobbit'' adapted to a serial in four intervals, which was declined by [[Rayner Unwin]] for its potential to \"incarcerate us in the local odeons for nine or ten hours.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Rembrandt films ===\nIn 1961, [[William L. Snyder]] negotiated the rights to adapt ''The Hobbit'' to animation. His company, Rembrandt films, had won multiple Oscars for animated shorts, and he contacted Tolkien's agent for the rights to ''The Hobbit.'' Unlike Ackerman, Snyder could raise sufficient funds for Tolkien and Unwin to enter negotiations to lease ''The Hobbit'' to him for five years, and give him creative freedom in adapting the book in exchange for a precentage off of the revenue. Due to a mishap in the publishing of the first edition of ''The Hobbit'' (and, later on, ''The Lord of the Rings'') the books were public domain in the US, which gave Snyder leverage to renegotiate the conditions of the lease. Tolkien and Unwin only received a $15,000 advance.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite book|last=Lee|first=Stuart D.|title=A Companion to J. R. R. Tolkien|publisher=Wiley|year=2020|isbn=9781119656029|location=|pages=518-521}}</ref> While Tolkien was aware that Snyder was \"sure to perpetrate [...] many objectionable things\",<ref name=\":0\" /> he agreed to lease the rights to the producer in 1962. In 1964 Tolkien was still wondering if a film will be made, and what it will be like, and Snyder reported that a script was being finalized.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSnyder commissioned cartoonist [[Gene Deitch]] to write a script for a feature-length ''Hobbit'' cartoon, during which he took significant liberties with the text, inserting a princess of Dale who undertakes the Quest and ends up married to Bilbo. Since ''The Lord of the Rings'' wasn't published in the US at the time, Deitch only became aware of it later on,<ref name=\":0\" /> and incorporated the concept of the Ring of Power into the Gollum (or Goloom, as he's called in the piece) episode later in the writing, making a sequel based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' possible.\n\nWhen a deal with [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]] fell through and the rights we due to expire, Snyder commissioned Deitch to quickly make a condensed film that would fulfill the requirements of the contract.

Carole Ward suggested adapting ''The Lord of the Rings'' for TV in 1964, to air on the newly-launched [[BBC Two|BBC2]]. [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] launched a competing offer, according to which the book will be adapted via puppetry, which Tolkien found contemptous. Another attempt at purchasing the TV rights was made in 1968, which would put it concurrently with the cinema rights being sold to United Artists. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond.|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing.|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=65-67}}</ref>\n\n=== United Artists ===\nProducer [[Samuel Gelfman]] first inquired about the rights to the books in 1959.

United Artists were the studio behind several of the lucrative widescreen epics of the decade. In the 1960s, long widescreen epics (presented as a [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow]] with an intermission) still proved successful, but few sequels were made in that genre, and therefore Katzka-Bernie commissioned Sir [[Peter Shaffer]] to write a treatment for a single, three-hour film adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings'', which was deemed \"elegant\",<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://thequietus.com/articles/25681-ralph-bakshi-the-lord-of-the-rings-animation-review-anniversary|title=The Lord of the Rings Animation Review Anniversary|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> keeping ''The Hobbit'' in mind as a potential prequel. Merchandizing was of little concern at the time, but the rights to make profit off of such productions was included in the contract.\n\nNegotiations extended until 1969, when the rights were sold off for $250,000 (adjusted for inflation, the modern equivalent is about $1.5 million) and 7.5% of gross receipts, minus expenses, to be paid to Tolkien. Shaffer's script never got off of the ground, but the rights were sold to United Artists in perpetuity, including the option to pass the rights to another studio. [[Arlo Guthrie]] pitched an animated feature to the studio, but UA were adamant they wanted the film to be live-action, although the contract options an animated film.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStanley Unwin suggested that Tolkien's inexperience in dealing with movie producers led to the generous conditions of the contract.<ref name=\":16\" /> Now elderly, Tolkien's desire to set-up a trust fund for his grandchildren could indicate that he might not have expected to live and see the resulting film, and wanted to use the profits to take care of his ailing wife.<ref name=\":0\" /> The increase in income tax rates at the time decreased Tolkien's profits off of book sales, and he expected a fall-off in the sales in years to come.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/focus-tolkien-sold-film-rights-to-lord-of-the-rings-to-avoid-taxman-ttwv6qh3rlv|title=Focus: Tolkien sold film rights to Lord of the Rings to avoid taxman|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In 1968, Tolkien expressed skepticism about adapting his works to film, saying \"its easier to film the Odyssey\"<ref name=\":15\" />, although he reportedly exhibited cautious enthusiasm in the conversations with Gelfman and in a later correspondence with John Boorman. \n\n==== Apple films ====\nDuring this period, [[The Beatles]] were on a three-picture deal with United Artists. Their previous two features, ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'', were directed by [[Richard Lester]] and were financially successful. When it became clear that the animated [[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]] would not count as part of this deal, Denis O'Dell (head of the Beatles' [[Apple Films]]) entered negotiations for their third film. He came up with the idea of a ''Lord of the Rings'' \"multimedia musical extravaganza\",<ref name=\":11\" /> starring the Beatles as the four Hobbits. He eventually learned that UA themselves were in negotiations for the rights.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=O'Dell|first=Dennis|title=At the Apple's core: the Beatles from the inside|publisher=Peter Owen Limited|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=92-105}}</ref>\n\nIn conversation with studio heads [[David V. Picker|David]] and Arnold Picker, it was decided that [[Richard Lester]] wasn't up for such an undertaking and a \"star director\" was required. O'Dell shortlisted Sir [[David Lean]] (with his writer at-the-time, [[Robert Bolt]]), [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]]. Lean and Kubrick, in particular, had experience in adapting literary works into widescreen epics, while Antonioni recently made his breakout English-language film in ''[[Blowup]]''.\n\nO'Dell phoned Lean once he got back to the hotel. Lean was a fan of ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and his brother [[Edward Tangye Lean|Tangye]] was an acquaintance of Tolkien's. He was interested, but busy with ''[[Ryan's Daughter]]''. \"Its a very interesting idea, Denis. Unfortunately I'm tied up at the moment with a little love story I'm going to do out here.\u201d<ref name=\":4\" /> Around this time, Lean's writer [[Robert Bolt]] turned down writing a [[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]] biopic for the same reason, and in the early 1970s both Bolt and Lean would pull out of an adaptation of [[Dune (novel)#Adaptations|Dune]], which would then be briefly attached to [[Rospo Pallenberg]] and eventually passing to [[Denis Villeneuve|Denis Villenueve]].\n\nDenis contacted Kubrick, who hadn't read the books, but was sent copies to read during the voyage back the UK. Meanwhile, O'Dell left to [[India]] to visit the Beatles, with the books in his suitcase. At the behest of [[Donovan]], who had previously been musically and cinematically interested in the books, the band divided the three volumes among themselves (Harrison was absent on the day of O'Dell's arrival) and began to think \"seriously\" about the idea.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nAccording to O'Dell, [[John Lennon|Lennon]] (reportedly the most taken with the books) fancied the role of Gandalf, but [[George Harrison|Harrison]] later recalled that John eventually wanted to swap for Frodo. Ringo wanted to play Sam, and [[Paul McCartney|McCartney]], also taken with the book, coveted Frodo. He later told Jackson that Lennon would have been Gollum, [[Ringo Starr|Ringo]] Sam and Harrison Gandalf.

When they started, they contemplated a three-film structure, but \u201cwe didn't know how that middle film would work\u201d<ref name=\":7\" /> without a beginning and an end. Conkling even started writing one long, three-and-a-half hour feature of the entire work. Early drafts of Conkling's included Farmer Maggot, Tom Bombadil, the Old Forest, Glorfindel, Arwen, and several songs. \n\nHowever, with $200,000 spent, Dan Melnick was fired from MGM.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> Bakshi contacted [[Saul Zaentz]], who had helped finance ''Fritz the Cat'', and persuaded him to produce ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> Zaentz had recently produced the Academy Award winning adaptation of ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]],'' distributed by United Artists, and agreed to buy the project. UA stayed as the distributors. The first film was budgeted at $8 million.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lord-rings-almost-starred-mick-jagger-1160023|title=How the Battle for 'Lord of the Rings' Nearly Broke a Director|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nSince Bakshi was primarily interested in Tolkien's more adult-oriented novel, Zaentz' Fantasy films procured the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'' as well as the rights to produce ''The Hobbit''. The rights to distribute the prequel remained with United Artists.\n\nAfter several drafts, Conkling's work was deemed unsatisfactory by Bakshi and Zaentz, who brought Peter S. Beagle to do rewrites. He insisted a complete overhaul was necessary, and wrote a version which began at Bilbo's Farewell Party, and continued until Saruman's Death, while Frodo and Sam left Cirith Ungol. This was abbreviated and cut in later revisions (adding a brief prologue in the process) so as to allow for a two-and-a-half hour movie.<ref name=\":7\" /> The final revisions overlapped with the voice recording in London, and account for some incosistencies like the spelling of Saruman's name in the film. Bakshi was approached by [[Mick Jagger]]<ref name=\":8\" /> and [[David Carradine]]<ref name=\":19\" /> for roles in the film, and Carradine even suggested that Bakshi do it in live-action.\n\nBakshi went to England to recruit a voice cast from the BBC Drama Repertory Company, including [[Christopher Guard]], [[William Squire]], Michael Scholes, [[Anthony Daniels]] and Sir [[John Hurt]]. Bakshi then shot character actors playing to the recording in empty soundstages, and later rotoscoped the performances.<ref name=\":8\" /> Bakshi later regretted his use of the rotoscoping technique, stating that he made a mistake by tracing the source footage rather than using it as a guide.<ref name=\"DirectorsSeries-1\">{{cite video|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9111970495147326968|title=The Directors Series: Interview with Ralph Bakshi (Part One)|date=|people=Gallagher, John A.|publisher=Google Video|location=|time=|accessdate=|format=|quote=|medium=}}</ref> Live-action footage for crowd scenes was shot in Death Valley and in Spain.<ref name=\":8\" /> To cut ballooning costs, cinematographer Timothy Galfas suggested solarizing the crowd scenes, to create a pseudo-animated look.

The whole project lasted less than 18 months.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nAt this time, Arthur Krim resigned from United Artists and was replaced by Andy Albeck, who objected to marketing the film as the first of two parts. After test screenings, it was decided to switch the other of the last two sequences, so that the film wouldn't end on the cliffhanger of Frodo and Sam being led into a trap by Gollum.

Although Jackson and Walsh re-read ''The Hobbit'' and even commissioned their workshop at WETA for some concept art, the rights to ''The Hobbit'' proved difficult because they were split between Zaentz and United Artists. [[Harvey Weinstein]] tried to purchase them from the studio, but was unsuccessful. \n\nIt was decided to move ahead with two ''Lord of the Rings'' films, leaving ''The Hobbit'' as a possible prequel. While filming, Jackson told Elijah Wood he wasn't interested in directing ''The Hobbit'', but during post-production on ''The Two Towers'', spoke more enthusiastically of it with composer Howard Shore.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rhino.com/article/interview-howard-shore-the-lord-of-the-rings|title=INTERVIEW: Howard Shore (\u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d)|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Jackson also later made joking remarks about TV spinoff shows.<ref>The Two Towers: Director's Commentary</ref>\n===''The Lord of the Rings''===\n{{Main article|The Lord of the Rings (film series)}}\nEventually, with Miramax owner [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] becoming increasingly uneasy with the sheer scope of the proposed project, the Weinsteins suggested reducing the project to a single, two-hour  film. Jackson was willing to consider this, if the film was to be around four hours in length, but Miramax limited it to two hours, and offered suggestions in order to achieve this, namely amalgamating Gondor and Rohan. They contacted [[Hossein Amini]] to rewrite and threatened to get [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] or [[Quentin Tarantino]] to direct.\n\nJackson refused, and was given the opportunity to find another studio to take over. In 1999, New Line Cinema assumed production responsibility (while Miramax executives [[Bob Weinstein]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] retained on-screen credits as executive producers). The three films were shot simultaneously. They featured extensive [[computer-generated imagery]], including major battle scenes utilizing the \"[[Massive (software)|Massive]]\" software program.
