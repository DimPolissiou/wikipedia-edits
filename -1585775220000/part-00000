As with all azole antifungal agents, ketoconazole works principally by inhibiting the [[enzyme]] [[cytochrome P450]] [[14\u03b1-demethylase]] (CYP51A1).<ref name=\"pmid6304148\"/> This enzyme participates in the [[sterol]] [[biosynthesis]] pathway that leads from [[lanosterol]] to [[ergosterol]]. Lower doses of [[fluconazole]] and [[itraconazole]] are required to kill fungi compared to ketoconazole, as they have been found to have a greater [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for fungal cell membranes.\n\nResistance to ketoconazole has been observed in a number of clinical fungal isolates, including ''Candida albicans''. Experimentally, resistance usually arises as a result of mutations in the sterol biosynthesis pathway. Defects in the sterol 5-6 desaturase enzyme reduce the toxic effects of azole inhibition of the 14-alpha demethylation step. [[Multidrug resistance|Multidrug-resistance]] (MDR) genes can also play a role in reducing cellular levels of the drug. As azole antifungals all act at the same point in the sterol pathway, resistant isolates are normally cross-resistant to all members of the azole family.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cartledge JD, Midgley J, Gazzard BG | title = Clinically significant azole cross-resistance in Candida isolates from HIV-positive patients with oral candidosis | journal = AIDS | volume = 11 | issue = 15 | pages = 1839\u201344 | date = December 1997 | pmid = 9412702 | doi = 10.1097/00002030-199715000-00008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sanglard D, Ischer F, Monod M, Bille J | title = Cloning of Candida albicans genes conferring resistance to azole antifungal agents: characterization of CDR2, a new multidrug ABC transporter gene | journal = Microbiology | volume = 143 ( Pt 2) | issue = Pt 2 | pages = 405\u201316 | date = February 1997 | pmid = 9043118 | doi = 10.1099/00221287-143-2-405 }}</ref>\n\n====Antihormonal activity====\nAs an [[antiandrogen]], ketoconazole operates through at least two [[mechanism of action|mechanisms]] of action.

As with all azole antifungal agents, ketoconazole works principally by inhibiting the [[enzyme]] [[cytochrome P450]] [[14\u03b1-demethylase]] (CYP51A1).<ref name=\"pmid6304148\"/> This enzyme participates in the [[sterol]] [[biosynthesis]] pathway that leads from [[lanosterol]] to [[ergosterol]]. Lower doses of [[fluconazole]] and [[itraconazole]] are required to kill fungi compared to ketoconazole, as they have been found to have a greater [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for fungal cell membranes.\n\nResistance to ketoconazole has been observed in a number of clinical fungal isolates, including ''Candida albicans''. Experimentally, resistance usually arises as a result of mutations in the sterol biosynthesis pathway. Defects in the sterol 5-6 desaturase enzyme reduce the toxic effects of azole inhibition of the 14-alpha demethylation step. [[Multidrug resistance|Multidrug-resistance]] (MDR) genes can also play a role in reducing cellular levels of the drug. As azole antifungals all act at the same point in the sterol pathway, resistant isolates are normally cross-resistant to all members of the azole family.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cartledge JD, Midgley J, Gazzard BG | title = Clinically significant azole cross-resistance in Candida isolates from HIV-positive patients with oral candidosis | journal = AIDS | volume = 11 | issue = 15 | pages = 1839\u201344 | date = December 1997 | pmid = 9412702 | doi = 10.1097/00002030-199715000-00008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sanglard D, Ischer F, Monod M, Bille J | title = Cloning of Candida albicans genes conferring resistance to azole antifungal agents: characterization of CDR2, a new multidrug ABC transporter gene | journal = Microbiology | volume = 143 ( Pt 2) | issue = Pt 2 | pages = 405\u201316 | date = February 1997 | pmid = 9043118 | doi = 10.1099/00221287-143-2-405 }}</ref>\n\n====Antihormonal activity====\nAs an [[antiandrogen]], ketoconazole operates through at least two [[mechanism of action|mechanisms]] of action.

It is the 3rd largest city in Vidarbha, situated about 290&nbsp;miles (580&nbsp;km) east of the state capital, [[Mumbai]], and 140&nbsp;miles (250&nbsp;km) west of the second capital, [[Nagpur]]. Akola is the administrative headquarters of [[Akola district|Akola District]] located in [[Amravati Division]]. Akola city is governed by the [[Akola Municipal Corporation]].\n\nThe city is known for the vibrant [[Varhadi language]]. The city of Akola is located in the north-central part of Maharashtra state, western India, on the banks of Morna River and it is an important district in Vidarbha region of Maharashtra State. Although not much of a tourist destination, it still is an important historical, cultural, political, agricultural city. The place is a prominent road and rail junction in the Tapti River valley; which is a commercial trading center.\n\nAkola is an important educational center as well, with several colleges affiliated with the Sant Gadge Baba Amravati University. The place is gradually developing into a great market center. The main language spoken by the people of Akola is Marathi; some communities also speak Urdu and Hindi.\n\nAkola District has an area of about 5,431 square kilometers and had a population of 1,818,617 at the 2011 census). Akola district includes seven [[taluka]]s which are Akola, Akot, Telhara, Balapur, Barshitakli, Murtijapur and Patur. Akola is the third-largest city in [[Vidarbha]] region after [[Nagpur]] and [[Amravati]]. [[Marathi language|Marathi]] is the most spoken and dominant language. Akola District is bordered on the north and east by [[Amravati district|Amravati District]], on the south by [[Washim District]], and on the west by [[Buldhana district|Buldhana District]].\n\n==History==\nAkola District along with the rest of the [[Berar Province|Berar]] province was part of the legendary [[monarchy|kingdom]] of [[Vidarbha]] mentioned in the [[Mahabharata]]. Barar also formed part of the [[Maurya Empire|Mauryan Empire]] during the reign of [[Ashoka the Great|Ashoka]] (272 to 231 BCE). Berar later came under the rule of the [[Satavahana]] dynasty (2nd century BCE\u20132nd century CE), the [[Vakataka]] dynasty (3rd to 6th centuries), the [[Chalukya dynasty]] (6th to 8th centuries), the [[Rashtrakuta]] dynasty (8th to 10th centuries), the Chalukyas again (10th to 12th centuries) and finally the [[Yadava dynasty]] of [[Daulatabad, Maharashtra|Devagiri]] (late 12th to early 14th centuries). A period of [[Muslim]] rule began when [[Alauddin Khalji|Ala ud din Khalji]], [[Delhi Sultanate|Sultan of Delhi]], conquered the region in the early 14th century. The region was part of the [[Bahmani Sultanate]], which broke away from the Delhi Sultanate in the mid-14th century. The Bahmani Sultanate broke up into smaller sultanates at the end of the 15th century, and in 1572 Berar became part of the [[Nizam Shahi]] sultanate, based at [[Ahmadnagar|Ahmednagar]]. The Nizam Shahis ceded Berar to the [[Mughal Empire]] in 1595. The Mughals ruled the [[Berar Province]] during the 17th century. As Mughal rule started to unravel at the start of the 18th century, [[Qamar-ud-din Khan, Asif Jah I|Asaf Jah I]], [[Nizam]] of [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]] seized the southern provinces of the empire (including Berar) in 1724, forming an independent state.\n\nAkola has been a part of India's mythological past. The place is mentioned as a part of the Berar province and the legendary kingdom of Vidarbha in the Mahabharata. Berar also formed a part of the Mauryan Empire during the reign of Ashoka (272 to 231 BCE). The province later came under the rule of the Satavahana dynasty (2nd-century BCE-2nd century CE), the Vakatakas (3rd to 6th centuries), the Chalukyan dynasty (6th to 8th centuries), the Rashtrakuta dynasty (8th to 10th centuries). The Chalukyas regained control of the region in the 10th to 12th centuries respectively and finally the Yadava dynasty of Devagiri (late 12th to early 14th centuries). Allauddin Khilji of the Delhi Sultanate conquered the region in the early 14th century that eventually became a part of the Bahmani Sultanate, which broke away from the Delhi Sultanate in the mid-14th century. The Bahmani Sultanate broke up into smaller sultanates at the end of the 15th century, and in 1572 Berar became part of the Nizam Shahi sultanate, based at Ahmednagar. The Nizam Shahs conceded Berar to the Mughal Empire in 1595. The Mughals ruled the province during the 17th century. As Mughal rule started to unravel at the start of the 18th century, Asaf Jah I, Nizam of Hyderabad seized the southern provinces of the empire (including Berar) in 1724, forming an independent state.\n\nThe rise of the Maratha Empire from 1674 to 1760 saw the region coming under the command of Chhatrapati Shivaji succeeded by his sons. In 1749, at the time of death of Shahu, he appointed Peshwa as the head of the Maratha Empire with certain conditions to follow. The Third battle of Panipat in 1761 crippled the Maratha Empire and corroded the power of Peshwa forever. But still, the Berar province remained under the Marathas.\n\nThe Battle of Aragon in1803 was fought here between the British and the Marathas during the Second Anglo-Maratha War. The Third Anglo-Maratha War saw the defeat of the last Peshwa, Baji Rao II by the British. In 1853, the Akola district together with the rest of Berar came under the administration of the British East India Company. Berar was divided into East and West Berar with Akola district being included in West Berar. In 1903, Berar was leased to the Nizam of Hyderabad by the British East India Company in return for the debt.\n\nAfter India's Independence in 1947 from British Government entire India including Berar province was divided into different states and a new Maharashtra state under the Government of Maharashtra was formed, with Akola district under it.\n\nMauryan Empire, Satavahana, Chalukyas, the Rashtrakutas, Vakatakas, Sultan of Delhi, Bahmani Sultanate, Nizam Shahi sultanate, Mughals, Nizams, Marathas, Peshwas and British. Chhatrapati Shivaji, Sambhaji, Shahuji, Gopalrao Bajirao Khedkar, Dr. Panjabrao Deshmukh, King Akol Singh, Sant Gajanan Maharaj, Brijlal Biyani, Sundarabai Khandelwal, Raosaheb Devraobaba Digambarji, Bhartiya, Samarth Ramdas Swami, etc.\n\n.\n\nThe Congress's proposed linguistic provinces plan before the Independence of India had positioned Akola as the headquarters of the Berar region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/ambedkar_partition/101.html|title=101|publisher=|accessdate=19 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/ambedkar_partition/tables/101a.html|title=101a|publisher=|accessdate=19 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nAfter India gained its independence in 1947, the states and provinces were reorganized in 1956. Berar was divided among different states. Akola became a part of bilingual [[Mumbai|Bombay]] state which was further divided into two states in 1960. Akola became a part of the new Maharashtra State.

Akola has a very good grain market, oil mills, dal ([[pulses]]) mills and is known for the production of cotton. The IT sector is also growing at a fast pace.\n\nAkola, called Cotton City, is known for its [[cotton]] production and is the largest cotton-producing district in India. The city is also famous for its [[pulse]]s (dal), oil and [[Cotton mill|textile mills]]. The city had all along been an important commercial and trading center. The facility of goods transportation and communication system in the form of railway and roads in addition to the extension of the electric grid system and establishment of the Paras\nThermal Power Station ensuring adequate electric power supply has contributed to the industrial development of the city in recent years.\n\nThe Dr. Panjabrao Deshmukh Krishi Vidyapeeth with its headquarters at Akola came into existence on 20 October 1969 and it added to the importance and development of the city.\n\n===Agriculture===\n[[File:Cotton Plant.png|right|thumb|A full-grown cotton plant]]\nAgriculture is the main occupation of the people in rural parts of the region. Cotton, [[Soybean]] and [[Sorghum|jawar]] (sorghum) are the essential crops grown in the district. Other important crops of the region are [[wheat]], [[sunflower]], [[canola]], [[peanut]], [[Pearl millet|Bajra]] (pearl millet), Harbara (chickpeas), Toor (pigeon peas), Urad and Moong (green gram). Most crops are dependent on the monsoon. Only 15% of Maharashtra's gross cropped area is irrigated, compared with the national average of 32.9% in 1989\u201390. Vidarbha's Amravati division's (including Akola District) share of gross cropped area under irrigation of 9%.\n\nConsidered one of Maharashtra's least developed regions, Vidarbha has seen not only farmers' suicides but also deaths caused by malnutrition.

Bharat Krishak Samaj, one of the leading organizations of farmers in India, is very active in the Akola region. It has played a crucial role in promoting the voice of the common farmers of the Vidarbha region to the attention of the [[Government of India|Indian government]] under the chairmanship of Prakash Shriram Mankar. Oil and dal mills are becoming rampant in this region because of the crops taken. Textile mills are also increasing to support the cotton-growing industry.\n\n===Akola MIDC Industrial Area===\nThe Akola MIDC Industrial Area is the largest and most economical industrial area in the division. It has four prominent industrial zones on the outskirts of the city. Cotton and [[jowar]] are the predominant crops grown in the district. Oil and dal mills are also rampant. The economy is mostly agriculture-based. Nowadays, the [[soybean]] crop is an important crop as major soybean plants have come up in the area. The total land under Akola MIDC Industrial area is 6.25&nbsp; km<sup>2</sup>. There are about 25 factories (3 large factories and 22 small factories) currently in production and another 10 small factories are in the process of being constructed. Maharashtra Government has sanctioned growth centers close to the Akola MIDC area.

Akola city is governed by the [[Akola Municipal Corporation]].\n\nThe city is known for the vibrant [[Varhadi language]]. The city of Akola is located in the north-central part of Maharashtra state, western India, on the banks of Morna River and it is an important district in Vidarbha region of Maharashtra State. Although not much of a tourist destination, it still is an important historical, cultural, political, agricultural city.

Akola District is bordered on the north and east by [[Amravati district|Amravati District]], on the south by [[Washim District]], and on the west by [[Buldhana district|Buldhana District]].\n\n==History==\nAkola District along with the rest of the [[Berar Province|Berar]] province was part of the legendary [[monarchy|kingdom]] of [[Vidarbha]] mentioned in the [[Mahabharata]]. Barar also formed part of the [[Maurya Empire|Mauryan Empire]] during the reign of [[Ashoka the Great|Ashoka]] (272 to 231 BCE). Berar later came under the rule of the [[Satavahana]] dynasty (2nd century BCE\u20132nd century CE), the [[Vakataka]] dynasty (3rd to 6th centuries), the [[Chalukya dynasty]] (6th to 8th centuries), the [[Rashtrakuta]] dynasty (8th to 10th centuries), the Chalukyas again (10th to 12th centuries) and finally the [[Yadava dynasty]] of [[Daulatabad, Maharashtra|Devagiri]] (late 12th to early 14th centuries). A period of [[Muslim]] rule began when [[Alauddin Khalji|Ala ud din Khalji]], [[Delhi Sultanate|Sultan of Delhi]], conquered the region in the early 14th century. The region was part of the [[Bahmani Sultanate]], which broke away from the Delhi Sultanate in the mid-14th century. The Bahmani Sultanate broke up into smaller sultanates at the end of the 15th century, and in 1572 Berar became part of the [[Nizam Shahi]] sultanate, based at [[Ahmadnagar|Ahmednagar]]. The Nizam Shahis ceded Berar to the [[Mughal Empire]] in 1595. The Mughals ruled the [[Berar Province]] during the 17th century. As Mughal rule started to unravel at the start of the 18th century, [[Qamar-ud-din Khan, Asif Jah I|Asaf Jah I]], [[Nizam]] of [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]] seized the southern provinces of the empire (including Berar) in 1724, forming an independent state.\n\nAkola has been a part of India's mythological past. The place is mentioned as a part of the Berar province and the legendary kingdom of Vidarbha in the Mahabharata. Berar also formed a part of the Mauryan Empire during the reign of Ashoka (272 to 231 BCE). The province later came under the rule of the Satavahana dynasty (2nd-century BCE-2nd century CE), the Vakatakas (3rd to 6th centuries), the Chalukyan dynasty (6th to 8th centuries), the Rashtrakuta dynasty (8th to 10th centuries). The Chalukyas regained control of the region in the 10th to 12th centuries respectively and finally the Yadava dynasty of Devagiri (late 12th to early 14th centuries). Allauddin Khilji of the Delhi Sultanate conquered the region in the early 14th century that eventually became a part of the Bahmani Sultanate, which broke away from the Delhi Sultanate in the mid-14th century. The Bahmani Sultanate broke up into smaller sultanates at the end of the 15th century, and in 1572 Berar became part of the Nizam Shahi sultanate, based at Ahmednagar. The Nizam Shahs conceded Berar to the Mughal Empire in 1595. The Mughals ruled the province during the 17th century. As Mughal rule started to unravel at the start of the 18th century, Asaf Jah I, Nizam of Hyderabad seized the southern provinces of the empire (including Berar) in 1724, forming an independent state.\n\nThe rise of the Maratha Empire from 1674 to 1760 saw the region coming under the command of Chhatrapati Shivaji succeeded by his sons. In 1749, at the time of death of Shahu, he appointed Peshwa as the head of the Maratha Empire with certain conditions to follow. The Third battle of Panipat in 1761 crippled the Maratha Empire and corroded the power of Peshwa forever. But still, the Berar province remained under the Marathas.\n\nThe Battle of Aragon in1803 was fought here between the British and the Marathas during the Second Anglo-Maratha War. The Third Anglo-Maratha War saw the defeat of the last Peshwa, Baji Rao II by the British. In 1853, the Akola district together with the rest of Berar came under the administration of the British East India Company. Berar was divided into East and West Berar with Akola district being included in West Berar. In 1903, Berar was leased to the Nizam of Hyderabad by the British East India Company in return for the debt.\n\nAfter India's Independence in 1947 from British Government entire India including Berar province was divided into different states and a new Maharashtra state under the Government of Maharashtra was formed, with Akola district under it.\n\nMauryan Empire, Satavahana, Chalukyas, the Rashtrakutas, Vakatakas, Sultan of Delhi, Bahmani Sultanate, Nizam Shahi sultanate, Mughals, Nizams, Marathas, Peshwas and British. Chhatrapati Shivaji, Sambhaji, Shahuji, Gopalrao Bajirao Khedkar, Dr. Panjabrao Deshmukh, King Akol Singh, Sant Gajanan Maharaj, Brijlal Biyani, Sundarabai Khandelwal, Raosaheb Devraobaba Digambarji, Bhartiya, Samarth Ramdas Swami, etc.\n\n.\n\nThe Congress's proposed linguistic provinces plan before the Independence of India had positioned Akola as the headquarters of the Berar region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/ambedkar_partition/101.html|title=101|publisher=|accessdate=19 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/ambedkar_partition/tables/101a.html|title=101a|publisher=|accessdate=19 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nAfter India gained its independence in 1947, the states and provinces were reorganized in 1956. Berar was divided among different states. Akola became a part of bilingual [[Mumbai|Bombay]] state which was further divided into two states in 1960. Akola became a part of the new Maharashtra State. The [[Narnala fort]], Akot fort, [[Akola fort]] and [[Balapur Fort]] are some of the famous monuments in Akola.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{IndiaCensusPop\n|title=Population growth\n|1981=225412\n|1991=328043\n|2001=400520\n|2011=425817\n|estimate=\n|estyear=\n|estref=\n|footnote=Source:Census of India<ref name=\"Mahapopulation\">{{cite web|url=http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/english/ecoSurvey/ataglanc.pdf |title=Mahapopulation |website=Census of India |publisher=www.maharashtra.gov.in |language=Marathi |accessdate=2008-06-04 |format=PDF |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303204222/http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/english/ecoSurvey/ataglanc.pdf |archivedate=3 March 2009 }}</ref>\n}}\n\n{{As of|2011}} India [[census]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040616075334/http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archivedate=2004-06-16|title= Census of India 2001: Data from the 2001 Census, including cities, villages and towns  (Provisional)|accessdate=2008-11-01|website= |publisher= Census Commission of India}}</ref>\nAkola City has a population of 425,817 and an area of about 124&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.\nPost municipal limit extension in Aug 2016, City of Akola has a population of 537,137 and an area of 124 sq.km.<ref>[[Akola Municipal Corporation]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Geography and climate==\nAkola is located at latitude 20.7\u00b0 North and longitude 77.07\u00b0 East.

[[English language|English]] names variously applied to different species include '''poplar''' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|p|\u0252|p|.|l|\u0259r}}, '''[[aspen]]''', and '''[[Populus sect.

The shoots are stout, with (unlike in the related [[willow]]s) the terminal bud present. The [[leaf|leaves]] are spirally arranged, and vary in shape from triangular to circular or (rarely) lobed, and with a long [[petiole (botany)|petiole]]; in species in the sections ''Populus'' and ''Aigeiros'', the petioles are laterally flattened, so that breezes easily cause the leaves to wobble back and forth, giving the whole tree a \"twinkling\" appearance in a breeze. Leaf size is very variable even on a single tree, typically with small leaves on side shoots, and very large leaves on strong-growing lead shoots. The leaves often turn bright gold to yellow before they fall during autumn.<ref name=rdm>Meikle, R. D. (1984). ''Willows and Poplars of Great Britain and Ireland''.

They are borne in long, drooping, sessile or pedunculate [[catkin]]s produced from buds formed in the axils of the leaves of the previous year. The flowers are each seated in a cup-shaped disk which is borne on the base of a scale which is itself attached to the rachis of the catkin. The scales are obovate, lobed, and fringed, membranous, hairy or smooth, and usually caducous. The male flowers are without [[calyx (botany)|calyx]] or [[Corolla (flower)|corolla]], and comprise a group of four to 60 [[stamen]]s inserted on a disk; filaments are short and pale yellow; [[anther]]s are oblong, purple or red, introrse, and two-celled; the cells open longitudinally. The female flower also has no calyx or corolla, and comprises a single-celled ovary seated in a cup-shaped disk. The style is short, with two to four stigmata, variously lobed, and numerous ovules. Pollination is by wind, with the female catkins lengthening considerably between pollination and maturity. The [[fruit]] is a two- to four-valved [[dehiscence (botany)|dehiscent]] [[capsule (fruit)|capsule]], green to reddish-brown, mature in midsummer, containing numerous minute light brown [[seed]]s surrounded by tufts of long, soft, white hairs which aid wind dispersal.<ref name=rdm/><ref name=Keeler>{{cite book | last =Keeler | first =H.

They have the advantage of growing to a very large size at a rapid pace. Almost all poplars take root readily from cuttings or where broken branches lie on the ground (they also often have remarkable suckering abilities, and can form huge colonies from a single original tree, such as the famous ''[[Pando (tree)|Pando]]'' forest made of thousands of ''[[Populus tremuloides]]'' clones).\n\nTrees with [[fastigiate]] (erect, columnar) branching are particularly popular, and are widely grown across Europe and southwest Asia. However, like [[willow]]s, poplars have very vigorous and invasive root systems stretching up to 40&nbsp;m from the trees; planting close to houses or ceramic water pipes may result in damaged foundations and cracked walls and pipes due to their search for moisture.\n\nA simple, reproducible, high-frequency micropropagation protocol in eastern cottonwood ''Populus deltoides'' has been reported by Yadav et al. 2009.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1007/s11816-009-0088-5 | volume=3 | issue=3 | title=High frequency direct plant regeneration from leaf, internode, and root segments of Eastern Cottonwood (Populus deltoides) | year=2009 | journal=Plant Biotechnology Reports | pages=175\u2013182 | last1=Yadav | first1=Rakesh }}</ref>\n\n===India===\n[[File:KDJHPOP.JPG|left|thumb|upright|Popular ''Populus'' variety G48 in Punjab, India; Jhalli Farms Village Niara/Hoshiarpur]]\n\nIn India, the poplar is grown commercially by farmers, mainly in the Punjab region. Common poplar varieties are:\n* G48 (grown in the plains of Punjab, Haryana, UP)\n* w22 (grown in mountainous regions, e.g., Himachal Pradesh, Pathankot, Jammu)\n\nThe trees are grown from ''kalam'' or cuttings, harvested annually in January and February, and commercially available up to 15{{nbsp}}November.\n\nMost commonly used to make [[plywood]], [[Yamuna Nagar]] in [[Haryana]] state has a large plywood industry reliant upon poplar.

The shoots are stout, with (unlike in the related [[willow]]s) the terminal bud present.

They are borne in long, drooping, sessile or pedunculate [[catkin]]s produced from buds formed in the axils of the leaves of the previous year. The flowers are each seated in a cup-shaped disk which is borne on the base of a scale which is itself attached to the rachis of the catkin. The scales are obovate, lobed, and fringed, membranous, hairy or smooth, and usually caducous. The male flowers are without [[calyx (botany)|calyx]] or [[Corolla (flower)|corolla]], and comprise a group of four to 60 [[stamen]]s inserted on a disk; filaments are short and pale yellow; [[anther]]s are oblong, purple or red, introrse, and two-celled; the cells open longitudinally. The female flower also has no calyx or corolla, and comprises a single-celled ovary seated in a cup-shaped disk. The style is short, with two to four stigmata, variously lobed, and numerous ovules. Pollination is by wind, with the female catkins lengthening considerably between pollination and maturity. The [[fruit]] is a two- to four-valved [[dehiscence (botany)|dehiscent]] [[capsule (fruit)|capsule]], green to reddish-brown, mature in midsummer, containing numerous minute light brown [[seed]]s surrounded by tufts of long, soft, white hairs which aid wind dispersal.<ref name=rdm/><ref name=Keeler>{{cite book | last =Keeler | first =H.

However, like [[willow]]s, poplars have very vigorous and invasive root systems stretching up to 40&nbsp;m from the trees; planting close to houses or ceramic water pipes may result in damaged foundations and cracked walls and pipes due to their search for moisture.\n\nA simple, reproducible, high-frequency micropropagation protocol in eastern cottonwood ''Populus deltoides'' has been reported by Yadav et al. 2009.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1007/s11816-009-0088-5 | volume=3 | issue=3 | title=High frequency direct plant regeneration from leaf, internode, and root segments of Eastern Cottonwood (Populus deltoides) | year=2009 | journal=Plant Biotechnology Reports | pages=175\u2013182 | last1=Yadav | first1=Rakesh }}</ref>\n\n===India===\n[[File:KDJHPOP.JPG|left|thumb|upright|Popular ''Populus'' variety G48 in Punjab, India; Jhalli Farms Village Niara/Hoshiarpur]]\n\nIn India, the poplar is grown commercially by farmers, mainly in the Punjab region. Common poplar varieties are:\n* G48 (grown in the plains of Punjab, Haryana, UP)\n* w22 (grown in mountainous regions, e.g., Himachal Pradesh, Pathankot, Jammu)\n\nThe trees are grown from ''kalam'' or cuttings, harvested annually in January and February, and commercially available up to 15{{nbsp}}November.\n\nMost commonly used to make [[plywood]], [[Yamuna Nagar]] in [[Haryana]] state has a large plywood industry reliant upon poplar.

A [[Plague (disease)|plague]] of 1710\u20131711 left the city without inhabitants, although it recovered fast, and in 1754 received a privilege to hold a market and four fairs per year. In 1792 Akmen\u0117 city rights  were reconfirmed and a [[coat of arms]] was granted.\n\nAfter the [[Partitions of Poland|Partitions of Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth]] the neighborhoods were donated to the wife of [[Russian Empire|Russian]] General Fitinhof.\n\n==The Jewish community==\n\nAccording to the records [[Jews]] arrived in Akmen\u0117 <ref name=JewishGen>[http://www.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/pinkas_lita/lit_00155.html \"Akmian\" \u2013 Encyclopedia of Jewish Communities in Lithuania]</ref> in the eighteenth century. By the mid-nineteenth century the majority of the population in the town was Jewish. The first mass migration of Jews followed the notorious [[May Laws]] of 1881. Many of the Jews who left in the face of increasing [[Tsarist]] persecution settled in [[Cork (city)|Cork, Ireland]], where Jews today still refer to themselves as Akmianers.\n\nIn 1915, some of the Jews were expelled into the Russian interior.\n\nBy 1939 the Jewish community had fallen in number to around 30 families. At the end of June 1941, following the [[Nazi occupation of Lithuania]], Jewish people were arrested. The [[Rollkommando Hamann]] with the help of local collaborators, shot and killed three Jews, and on August 4, 1941, all the remaining prisoners were transferred to three silos on the bank of the river [[Venta River|Venta]], near [[Ma\u017eeikiai]]. The men were taken immediately to dig pits and the women were imprisoned in Ma\u017eeikiai together with other Jewish women prisoners. All of them were murdered together with the Jews of Ma\u017eeikiai and the surroundings on August 9, 1941. In 1958, one of the nationalists who escorted the Jews from Akmen\u0117 to Ma\u017eeikiai was tried for his involvement in the murder of the Jewish population.<ref name=JewishGen/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{commons category|Akmen\u0117}}\n{{Siauliai County}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Akmene}}\n[[Category:Akmen\u0117 District Municipality]]\n[[Category:Cities in Lithuania]]\n[[Category:Cities in \u0160iauliai County]]\n[[Category:Shavelsky Uyezd]]\n[[Category:Holocaust locations in Lithuania]]\n[[Category:Akmen\u0117| ]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akmen%C4%97"}
