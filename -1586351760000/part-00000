She popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of [[COBOL]], an early [[high-level programming language]] still in use today.\n\nPrior to joining the Navy, Hopper earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from [[Yale University]] and was a professor of mathematics at [[Vassar College]]. Hopper attempted to enlist in the Navy during [[World War II]] but was rejected because she was 34 years old. She instead joined the Navy Reserves. Hopper began her computing career in 1944 when she worked on the Harvard Mark I team led by [[Howard H. Aiken]]. In 1949, she joined the [[Eckert\u2013Mauchly Computer Corporation]] and was part of the team that developed the [[UNIVAC I]] computer.  At Eckert\u2013Mauchly she began developing the compiler. She believed that a programming language based on English was possible.  Her compiler converted English terms into [[machine code]] understood by computers. By 1952, Hopper had finished her program [[Linker (computing)|linker]] (originally called a compiler), which was written for the [[A-0 System]].<ref name=\"Spencer85\">{{cite book|title=Computers and Information Processing|publisher=C.E.

In 1959, she participated in the [[CODASYL]] consortium, which consulted Hopper to guide them in creating a machine-independent programming language. This led to the [[COBOL]] language, which was inspired by her idea of a language being based on English words.

She popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of [[COBOL]], an early [[high-level programming language]] still in use today.\n\nPrior to joining the Navy, Hopper earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from [[Yale University]] and was a professor of mathematics at [[Vassar College]]. Hopper attempted to enlist in the Navy during [[World War II]] but was rejected because she was 34 years old. She instead joined the Navy Reserves. Hopper began her computing career in 1944 when she worked on the Harvard Mark I team led by [[Howard H. Aiken]]. In 1949, she joined the [[Eckert\u2013Mauchly Computer Corporation]] and was part of the team that developed the [[UNIVAC I]] computer.  At Eckert\u2013Mauchly she began developing the compiler. She believed that a programming language based on English was possible.  Her compiler converted English terms into [[machine code]] understood by computers. By 1952, Hopper had finished her program [[Linker (computing)|linker]] (originally called a compiler), which was written for the [[A-0 System]].<ref name=\"Spencer85\">{{cite book|title=Computers and Information Processing|publisher=C.E.

In 1959, she participated in the [[CODASYL]] consortium, which consulted Hopper to guide them in creating a machine-independent programming language. This led to the [[COBOL]] language, which was inspired by her idea of a language being based on English words. In 1966, she retired from the Naval Reserve, but in 1967 the Navy recalled her to active duty.  She retired from the Navy in 1986 and found work as a consultant for the [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], sharing her computing experiences.\n\nThe U.S. Navy {{sclass-|Arleigh Burke|destroyer|0}} guided-missile destroyer {{USS|Hopper}} was named for her, as was the [[Cray XE6]] \"Hopper\" supercomputer at [[NERSC]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nersc.gov/users/computational-systems/retired-systems/hopper/|title=Hopper|website=www.nersc.gov|access-date=2016-03-19}}</ref> During her lifetime, Hopper was awarded 40 honorary degrees from universities across the world.

Hopper's request to transfer to the regular Navy at the end of the war was declined due to her advanced age of 38. She continued to serve in the Navy Reserve.

In the meantime, she published her first paper on the subject, compilers, in 1952. In the early 1950s, the company was taken over by the [[Remington Rand]] corporation, and it was while she was working for them that her original [[compiler]] work was done.  The program was known as the A compiler and its first version was [[A-0 programming language|A-0]].<ref name=\"mcgee2004\" />{{rp|11}}\n\nIn 1952, she had an operational link-loader, which at the time was referred to as a compiler.

So I decided data processors ought to be able to write their programs in English, and the computers would translate them into machine code.

The new language extended Hopper's FLOW-MATIC language with some ideas from the [[IBM]] equivalent, [[COMTRAN]].  Hopper's belief that programs should be written in a language that was close to English (rather than in [[machine code]] or in languages close to machine code, such as [[assembly language]]s) was captured in the new business language, and COBOL went on to be the most ubiquitous business language to date.<ref name=\"KWB\">{{cite book |last=Beyer |first=Kurt W. |title=Grace Hopper and the Invention of the Information Age |accessdate= |edition= |year=2009 |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-262-01310-9}}</ref> Among the members of the committee that worked on COBOL was [[Mount Holyoke College]] alumnus [[Jean E.

Pictures]] and based on characters that appear in [[American comic book]]s by [[DC Comics]]. The shared universe, much like the original [[DC Universe]] in comic books and the television programs, was established by [[Crossover (fiction)|crossing over]] common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters. The films have been in production since 2011 and in that time Warner Bros. has distributed eight films, with a multitude of other planned films in various stages of development. It is the [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest-grossing franchises and film series|eleventh-highest-grossing film franchise]] of all time, having grossed over $5.48 billion at the global box office. Its highest-grossing film is ''[[Aquaman (film)|Aquaman]]'', which earned over $1.15 billion worldwide, becoming the [[List of films based on DC Comics publications|highest-grossing DC film]] to date.\n\nThe films are written and directed by a variety of individuals and feature large, often [[Ensemble cast|ensemble]] casts. [[Henry Cavill]], [[Ben Affleck]], [[Gal Gadot]], [[Ezra Miller]], [[Jason Momoa]] and [[Ray Fisher (actor)|Ray Fisher]], among others, star in several films. However, unlike the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], the franchise has non-linear, loosely connected storylines, with greater autonomy for the filmmakers who create each individual film. The first film in the DCEU was ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' (2013), followed by ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016), ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'' (2016), ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'' (2017), ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]'' (2017), ''[[Aquaman (film)|Aquaman]]'' (2018), ''[[Shazam! (film)|Shazam!]]'' (2019), and ''[[Birds of Prey (2020 film)|Birds of Prey]]'' (2020). The franchise will continue with ''[[Wonder Woman 1984]]'' in 2020, ''[[The Batman (film)|The Batman]]'', ''[[The Suicide Squad (film)|The Suicide Squad]]'', and ''Black Adam'' in 2021; and ''Shazam! 2'', ''The Flash'', and ''Aquaman 2'' in 2022.\n\n== Development ==\nIn 2002, [[Wolfgang Petersen]] was set to direct a ''[[Superman in film#Batman vs. Superman (2001\u20132002)|Batman vs. Superman]]'' film from a script by [[Akiva Goldsman]].<ref name=\"BvSNewsweek\"/> Warner Bros. canceled development to focus on individual Superman and Batman projects after [[J.

Several television series featuring DC characters and storylines have their own shared continuity, frequently referred to as the [[Arrowverse]].<ref name=\"Arrowverse\"/> DC's [[chief creative officer]] [[Geoff Johns]] explained DC's difference in approach to [[Marvel Studios]] and their cinematic universe, saying, \"We look at it as the [[multiverse]]. We have our TV universe and our film universe, but they all co-exist. For us, creatively, it's about allowing everyone to make the best possible product, to tell the best story, to do the best world. Everyone has a vision and you really want to let the visions shine through ... It's just a different approach.\"<ref name=\"GoeffJonesBuzzFeed\"/> In June 2015, Warner Bros. president of creative development Greg Silverman expanded on DC's approach to their cinematic universe, saying, \"We ... take these beloved characters and put them in the hands of master filmmakers and make sure they all coordinate with each other. You'll see the difference when you see ... the things that we are working on.\"<ref name=\"SilvermanTHR\"/>\n\nIn May 2016, following criticism of ''Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice'', Warner Bros. established a [[DC Films]] division with Geoff Johns and Warner Bros. executive vice president Jon Berg as its heads,<ref name=\"GeoffJohnsVulture\"/> which oversees production to form a cohesive creative direction for the franchise.<ref name=\"Shakeup\"/><ref name=\"WarnerBrosResponse\"/> DC Films would not be fully autonomous, as Johns reported to DC president [[Diane Nelson (comics)|Diane Nelson]] and Berg reported to Silverman.<ref name=\"Shakeup\"/> [[Charles Roven]] was also moved from his day-by-day producer role on future DC films, which he had served since 2005's ''Batman Begins'', to an administrative executive producer role.<ref name=\"RovenFallout\"/> In December, Silverman was ousted from his role in Warner Bros., and [[Toby Emmerich]] was promoted to president and chief content officer, in his place.<ref name=\"EmmerichCCO\"/> By January 2017, Johns and Berg reported to Emmerich.<ref name=\"GreenLanternWriters\"/> Following the financial and critical success of ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'' in June 2017, Johns stated that moving forward the films will focus on the heart, humor, hope, heroics, and optimism of the characters.<ref name=\"GeoffJohnsTheWrap\"/> As a result of [[Justice League (film)|''Justice League'']]'s underperformance at the box office, Berg left his position by January 2018 and became a production partner with [[Roy Lee]].<ref name=\"Shakeup2\"/><ref name=\"HamadaVariety\"/> DC also sought to deemphasize the shared nature of their films, with Diane Nelson stating, \"Our intention, certainly, moving forward is using the continuity to help make sure nothing is diverging in a way that doesn't make sense, but there's no insistence upon an overall storyline or interconnectivity in that universe... Moving forward, you'll see the DC movie universe being a universe, but one that comes from the heart of the filmmaker who's creating them.\"<ref name=\"RethinkVulture\"/>\n\nIn January 2018, [[Walter Hamada]] was appointed the President of DC Films and co-runner of the DCEU, replacing Berg.<ref name=\"HamadaVariety\"/> The following month, Chantal Nong was named Vice President of DC Films.<ref name=\"ChantalNongVP\"/> The pair were hired to oversee the franchise with Johns, as the key production team managers.<ref name=\"HamadaVariety\"/> However, Johns stepped down from his executive roles at DC in June 2018. He created a production company, Mad Ghost Productions, to have a greater hands-on role in various DC media as a writer and producer.<ref name=\"GeoffJohnsExit\"/> After the financial success of ''Aquaman'', Warner Bros.

with the naming convention of the already established [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU).<ref name=\"DCMarvelForbes\"/><ref name=\"DCCUYahoo\"/><ref name=\"DCCU-EW\"/> Keith Staskiewicz, writing for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', coined the term \"DC Extended Universe\u2122\" as a joke in an article of his about ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' on July 1, 2015.<ref name=\"DCEU-EW\"/><ref name=\"DCEU-SR\"/> This term and the abbreviation DCEU quickly spread among the press and fans thinking of it as the official name of the franchise over the following years.<ref name=\"TheyAreLegend\"/><ref name=\"BvSEmpireCover\"/> According to ''[[Vulture.com|Vulture]]'' writer Abraham Riesman, DC confirmed to him in September 2017 that the term is not used internally and they do not consider it official.<ref name=\"DCEU-SR\"/> In 2016, as part of ''DC Films Presents: Dawn of the Justice League'', both Geoff Johns and [[Kevin Smith]] referred to the franchise's name as being the \"Justice League Universe\".<ref name=\"JLU-SR\"/> During the [[DC Films]] panel at [[San Diego Comic-Con]] 2018, a video banner displayed the words \"Welcome to the Worlds of DC\", after showcasing some upcoming films. As a result, some media outlets interpreted this as DC officially naming their shared film universe as the \"Worlds of DC\".<ref name=\"WoDC-SR\"/><ref name=\"WoDCForbes\"/> Despite this, there has been no official announcement from Warner Bros. nor DC Films to confirm this.}} is an unofficial term used to refer to an American [[media franchise]] and [[shared universe]] that is centered on a [[film series|series]] of [[superhero film]]s, distributed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] and based on characters that appear in [[American comic book]]s by [[DC Comics]]. The shared universe, much like the original [[DC Universe]] in comic books and the television programs, was established by [[Crossover (fiction)|crossing over]] common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters. The films have been in production since 2011 and in that time Warner Bros. has distributed eight films, with a multitude of other planned films in various stages of development. It is the [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest-grossing franchises and film series|eleventh-highest-grossing film franchise]] of all time, having grossed over $5.48 billion at the global box office. Its highest-grossing film is ''[[Aquaman (film)|Aquaman]]'', which earned over $1.15 billion worldwide, becoming the [[List of films based on DC Comics publications|highest-grossing DC film]] to date.\n\nThe films are written and directed by a variety of individuals and feature large, often [[Ensemble cast|ensemble]] casts. [[Henry Cavill]], [[Ben Affleck]], [[Gal Gadot]], [[Ezra Miller]], [[Jason Momoa]] and [[Ray Fisher (actor)|Ray Fisher]], among others, star in several films. However, unlike the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], the franchise has non-linear, loosely connected storylines, with greater autonomy for the filmmakers who create each individual film. The first film in the DCEU was ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' (2013), followed by ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016), ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'' (2016), ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'' (2017), ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]'' (2017), ''[[Aquaman (film)|Aquaman]]'' (2018), ''[[Shazam! (film)|Shazam!]]'' (2019), and ''[[Birds of Prey (2020 film)|Birds of Prey]]'' (2020). The franchise will continue with ''[[Wonder Woman 1984]]'' in 2020, ''[[The Batman (film)|The Batman]]'', ''[[The Suicide Squad (film)|The Suicide Squad]]'', and ''Black Adam'' in 2021; and ''Shazam! 2'', ''The Flash'', and ''Aquaman 2'' in 2022.\n\n== Development ==\nIn 2002, [[Wolfgang Petersen]] was set to direct a ''[[Superman in film#Batman vs. Superman (2001\u20132002)|Batman vs. Superman]]'' film from a script by [[Akiva Goldsman]].<ref name=\"BvSNewsweek\"/> Warner Bros. canceled development to focus on individual Superman and Batman projects after [[J. J. Abrams]] submitted another draft for ''Superman: Flyby''.<ref name=\"DevelopmentHell\"/><ref name=\"BalePetersenMTV\"/> In February 2007, Warner Bros. hired husband and wife duo Michele and [[Kieran Mulroney]] to write a script for a ''[[Justice League]]'' film.<ref name=\"JusticeVariety2007\"/> [[Christian Bale]], who starred as Batman in ''[[Batman Begins]]'' (2005), was not approached to reprise the role,<ref name=\"BaleJusticeLeague\"/> nor was [[Brandon Routh]], who starred as Superman in ''[[Superman Returns]]'' (2006).<ref name=\"RouthJusticeLeague\"/> [[George Miller (director)|George Miller]] was hired to direct the film,<ref name=\"MillerVariety\"/> reportedly titled ''Justice League Mortal'',<ref name=\"JLMortalVariety\"/> with [[Armie Hammer]] cast as Batman, [[D. J. Cotrona]] as Superman, [[Adam Brody]] as Flash, [[Santiago Cabrera]] as Aquaman, [[Common (rapper)|Common]] as Green Lantern, [[Megan Gale]] as Wonder Woman, [[Hugh Keays-Byrne]] as [[Martian Manhunter]] and [[Jay Baruchel]] as [[Maxwell Lord]].<ref name=\"GaleWonderWoman\"/> The project was put on indefinite hold in January 2008, after failing to secure [[tax breaks]] for filming in Australia, as well as the [[2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike]] preventing progress on the script.<ref name=\"JusticeLeagueCancelled\"/>\n\nIn 2013, a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the [[Superman in film|''Superman'' franchise]], ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'', was set to lay the groundwork for future DC films.<ref name=\"ManOfSteelEW\"/> The film contained references to other characters in the [[DC Universe]], so if it were a success, it could launch a shared universe.<ref name=\"MoSBleedingCool\"/><ref name=\"ManofSteelSR\"/> Days before ''Man of Steel''{{'}}s release in June, it was reported that director [[Zack Snyder]] and screenwriter [[David S. Goyer]] would be returning for a sequel, which was being fast-tracked by Warner Bros.<ref name=\"GoyerMoSSequel\"/> In July, at [[San Diego Comic-Con]], it was revealed that the sequel would include Batman in a main role, establishing the shared universe.<ref name=\"LATimesCC2013\"/><ref name=\"EWCC2013\"/> In October 2014, Warner Bros. announced a slate of ten DC films.<ref name=\"2014Slate\"/>\n\n[[File:Geoff Johns by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|left|Geoff Johns has served in various positions in DC Films and the DCEU.]]\nWhile the rival [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) includes television productions, DC's crossover series is a shared continuity for films. Several television series featuring DC characters and storylines have their own shared continuity, frequently referred to as the [[Arrowverse]].<ref name=\"Arrowverse\"/> DC's [[chief creative officer]] [[Geoff Johns]] explained DC's difference in approach to [[Marvel Studios]] and their cinematic universe, saying, \"We look at it as the [[multiverse]]. We have our TV universe and our film universe, but they all co-exist. For us, creatively, it's about allowing everyone to make the best possible product, to tell the best story, to do the best world. Everyone has a vision and you really want to let the visions shine through ... It's just a different approach.\"<ref name=\"GoeffJonesBuzzFeed\"/> In June 2015, Warner Bros. president of creative development Greg Silverman expanded on DC's approach to their cinematic universe, saying, \"We ... take these beloved characters and put them in the hands of master filmmakers and make sure they all coordinate with each other. You'll see the difference when you see ... the things that we are working on.\"<ref name=\"SilvermanTHR\"/>\n\nIn May 2016, following criticism of ''Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice'', Warner Bros. established a [[DC Films]] division with Geoff Johns and Warner Bros. executive vice president Jon Berg as its heads,<ref name=\"GeoffJohnsVulture\"/> which oversees production to form a cohesive creative direction for the franchise.<ref name=\"Shakeup\"/><ref name=\"WarnerBrosResponse\"/> DC Films would not be fully autonomous, as Johns reported to DC president [[Diane Nelson (comics)|Diane Nelson]] and Berg reported to Silverman.<ref name=\"Shakeup\"/> [[Charles Roven]] was also moved from his day-by-day producer role on future DC films, which he had served since 2005's ''Batman Begins'', to an administrative executive producer role.<ref name=\"RovenFallout\"/> In December, Silverman was ousted from his role in Warner Bros., and [[Toby Emmerich]] was promoted to president and chief content officer, in his place.<ref name=\"EmmerichCCO\"/> By January 2017, Johns and Berg reported to Emmerich.<ref name=\"GreenLanternWriters\"/> Following the financial and critical success of ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'' in June 2017, Johns stated that moving forward the films will focus on the heart, humor, hope, heroics, and optimism of the characters.<ref name=\"GeoffJohnsTheWrap\"/> As a result of [[Justice League (film)|''Justice League'']]'s underperformance at the box office, Berg left his position by January 2018 and became a production partner with [[Roy Lee]].<ref name=\"Shakeup2\"/><ref name=\"HamadaVariety\"/> DC also sought to deemphasize the shared nature of their films, with Diane Nelson stating, \"Our intention, certainly, moving forward is using the continuity to help make sure nothing is diverging in a way that doesn't make sense, but there's no insistence upon an overall storyline or interconnectivity in that universe... Moving forward, you'll see the DC movie universe being a universe, but one that comes from the heart of the filmmaker who's creating them.\"<ref name=\"RethinkVulture\"/>\n\nIn January 2018, [[Walter Hamada]] was appointed the President of DC Films and co-runner of the DCEU, replacing Berg.<ref name=\"HamadaVariety\"/> The following month, Chantal Nong was named Vice President of DC Films.<ref name=\"ChantalNongVP\"/> The pair were hired to oversee the franchise with Johns, as the key production team managers.<ref name=\"HamadaVariety\"/> However, Johns stepped down from his executive roles at DC in June 2018. He created a production company, Mad Ghost Productions, to have a greater hands-on role in various DC media as a writer and producer.<ref name=\"GeoffJohnsExit\"/> After the financial success of ''Aquaman'', Warner Bros. CEO [[Kevin Tsujihara]] said the upcoming slate of DC films would be focused on individual character stories instead of interconnectivity.<ref name=\"TsujiharaLATimes\"/>\n\n== Released films ==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center; width:99%;\"\n|-\n!
