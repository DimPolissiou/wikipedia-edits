It helps learners understand the causes and consequences of climate change, prepares them to live with the [[effects of global warming|impacts of climate change]] and empowers learners to take appropriate actions to adopt more [[Sustainable living|sustainable lifestyles]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002330/233083e.pdf|title=Not Just Hot Air: Putting Climate Change Education into Practice|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100101-7|location=|pages=6, 8, 10, 32, 40, 44, 46, 48, 58}}</ref>\n\nCCE helps policymakers understand the urgency and importance of putting mechanisms into place to combat climate change on a national and global scale. Communities learn about how climate change will affect them, what they can do to protect themselves from negative consequences, and how they can reduce their own [[climate footprint]]. In particular, CCE helps increase the resilience of already vulnerable communities who are the most likely to be adversely affected by climate change.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nCCE is rooted in [[Education for sustainable development]] (ESD).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== UNESCO Climate Change Education for Sustainable Development programme ==\nEstablished in 2010, the [[UNESCO]] Climate Change Education for Sustainable Development programme (CCESD) aims to help people understand climate change by expanding CCE activities in [[Nonformal learning|nonformal education]] through the media, networking and partnerships. It is grounded in the holistic approach of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) which incorporates key sustainable development issues such as climate change, [[disaster risk reduction]] and others into education, in a way that addresses the interdependence of environmental sustainability, economic viability and social justice. It promotes participatory teaching and learning methods that motivate and empower learners to change their behaviour and take action for sustainable development. The programme seeks to help people understand the impact of global warming today and increase \u2018climate literacy\u2019, especially among young people, and aims to make education a more central part of the international response to climate change. UNESCO works with national governments to integrate CCE into national [[Curriculum|curricula]] and to develop innovative teaching and learning approaches for doing so.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Selected country profiles regarding CCE and ESD ==\n\n=== Australia ===\nAustralia has been at the forefront of [[Education for sustainable development|education for sustainability]], adopting in 2000 a national plan entitled Environmental Education for a Sustainable Future. A number of initiatives and bodies were created to implement the national plan, including the Australian Sustainable Schools Initiative and [[Australian Research Institute for Environment and Sustainability]]. These provided a strong foundation for Australia\u2019s strategy, launched in 2006, to respond to the [[Education for sustainable development#United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development .28DESD.29|UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development]]. The strategy set out the goal to mainstream sustainability through a holistic approach that engages the community through education and [[lifelong learning]]. Whereas climate change was referred to as one of a number of environmental concerns in the first national plan, a new plan launched in 2009, entitled Living Sustainably: the Australian Government\u2019s National Action Plan for Education for Sustainability, had a greater focus on climate change and its impacts on other natural resources within a wider global context. The new plan incorporated climate change within education for sustainability, rather than establishing a new and potentially competing field of Climate Change Education. Australia introduced its first-ever national curriculum in 2014, including sustainability as one of three cross-curriculum subjects.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSince 2009, Climate Change Education has been most evident in the [[TVET (Technical and Vocational Education and Training)|VET sector]]. [[Council of Australian Governments|COAG]] endorsed the Green Skills Agreement in 2009, and the Ministerial Council for Vocational and Technical Education published the National VET Sector Sustainability Policy and Action Plan (2009-2012). These initiatives aimed to provide workers with the skills needed to transition to a low-carbon economy and VET teachers with suitable training packages to promote education for sustainability.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== China ===\nChina introduced [[environmental education]] in the late 1970s as a result of increased attention to sustainable development and the need to protect the environment. Following the [[Earth Summit|United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] (Rio de Janeiro, 1992), environmental education moved towards environment, population and development, and finally education for sustainable development.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Chinese government has produced a number of policy documents identifying environmental education and ESD as key to quality education. In 2003, the Ministry of Education issued the first guiding policy - the Guidelines for Implementing Environmental Education in Elementary and Secondary School - on environmental education in China. ESD was formally incorporated into the national education policy in 2010 in The National Education Outline 2010-2020, and further integrated in some local education policies. National climate change policies and plans in China refer to education but do not specifically address CCE. This has resulted in limited institutional support to date. There is no national ESD or CCE action plan or official policy to inform its implementation.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn China, ESD mainly refers to providing individuals with the scientific knowledge, learning capacity, values and lifestyle choices to meet the country\u2019s sustainable development objectives. CCE is most commonly implemented as a component of ESD. A number of educational approaches have been adopted to facilitate the implementation of ESD. These include integrating ESD values into school philosophy, [[curriculum development]], capacity-building of teachers and educators, ESD pedagogical approaches and ESD and CCE thematic activities.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nESD is a component of compulsory education, but is limited in higher education, VET and adult education. The Ministry of Education has recently issued a guidance document that identified the VET sector in particular as needing to be reformed to meet the sustainable development objectives of the Chinese economy.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Denmark ===\nDenmark and its neighbouring countries began working together in the 1990s to formulate a policy for ESD. While Denmark signed the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] (UNECE) declaration on ESD in 2005, it did not adopt a strategy until 2009, just before the half-way point of the DESD. The Ministry of Education, which was made responsible for the DESD, organised a consultation process on how to promote ESD before adopting its strategy in 2009.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe UN Climate Summit (COP15) held in Denmark in December 2009 provided the impetus to develop of a number of national ESD policy initiatives. A national strategy on ESD was developed with a substantial climate change component. The aim of the strategy is to make citizens more responsible for their actions by improving their scientific knowledge. The ESD strategy notes that climate change should not be the sole focus of ESD, though the concrete initiatives that are part of the strategy mostly support the CCE projects and activities that were part of COP15 preparations.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA new national school curriculum adopted in 2009 included elements of ESD and CCE. The concept of sustainability was embedded in the goals describing the interrelationships between nature and society. CCE is mostly approached as teaching climate science, but it was also included in subjects such as geography and social studies, where the interrelationships between human behaviour, consumption and climate are examined.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThere has been no explicit policy change in the TVET sector to upgrade skills to respond to climate change and environmental issues. However, it is important to note that the Danish TVET sector had previously reflected skills related to ecological modernisation in areas such as energy generation, [[waste management]] and agriculture. While the new government identified the economic and environmental climate change crises as important, education is only referred to in relation to the economic crisis. There is no mention of climate change or sustainability with regard to education, and the platform documentation on \u2018green transition\u2019 does not mention education. Overall, no policy strategy has been set to promote ESD, CCE, or the \u2018greening\u2019 of TVET as part of the government\u2019s sustainable development and climate change policies. Government initiatives support NGO-led projects to raise community awareness of climate change. A national network on ESD was established with funding through to 2013.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Dominican Republic ===\nThe Dominican Republic has taken a lead role in promoting ESD. Environmental education was made mandatory for all schools in 1998 and this has since evolved into ESD. In 2000, the General Law of Environment and Natural Resources changed the way environmental education was taught, moving from a subject matter to a cross-cutting and interdisciplinary theme. Risk management is also an important aspect of MINERD\u2019s strategic plan, and has been integrated into the school curriculum as a cross-cutting subject. In 2004, the Environmental Education Strategy for Sustainable Development was adopted, which fosters formal and non-formal ESD. It is based on constructivism and uses a variety of pedagogical techniques that promote participatory learning.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Ten-year 2008-2018 Education Plan (PDE) addresses the issue of quality education, including sustainable development and a culture of peace. It also established a process for periodic review of the curriculum. Climate change is also being introduced into the curriculum. The National Teacher Training Institute (INAFOCAM) and the Salom\u00e9 Ure\u00f1a Higher Institute for Teacher Training (ISFODOSU) provide support for environmental education through teacher training and curriculum support. The Ten-year 2008-2018 Higher Education Plan (PDES) includes environmental issues in the curricula and establishes a research programme to promote sustainable development.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Dominican Republic has been involved in a number of ESD and CCE initiatives that have helped build local capacity, including:\n* formal, non-formal and informal projects on ESD led by governmental agencies, civil society organizations, young leaders and local communities;\n* UN: CC Learn Project, which supports the design and implementation of results-oriented and sustainable learning to address climate change (see the detailed case study in this Report);\n* National Strategy to Strengthen Human Resource Capacities to Advance Green, Low Emission and Climate Resilient Development (ENDVBERC);\n* teacher training supported by the UN: CC Learn-UNITAR, and the UNESCO-CCESD pilot programme.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===UK===\n====England====\nEnvironmental and development education have been present in England since the 1970s, when civil society organizations took the lead. From the late 1990s, the UK government promoted sustainable development and ESD at the local, regional and national levels. However, while a number of strategic government reports addressed CCE, government policy has focused less on ESD since 2010.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe 2008 report Brighter Futures \u2013 Greener Lives: Sustainable Development Action Plan 2008-2010 outlined a number of specific initiatives related to Climate Change Education using an ESD approach. This included empowering youth with the skills, knowledge and freedom to voice their opinions and make a difference. The same year, CCE was introduced into the [[Key Stage 3]] (11 to 14 year-olds) geography curriculum.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe report '' Education for Sustainable Development in the UK 2010'' noted that there were signs of substantial progress in embedding ESD-related policies and developing practices in the UK across a wide range of sectors in 2008 and 2009. For example, documents in 2009 highlighted the \u2018Sustainable Schools\u2019 project that aims to empower youth to cope with the future challenges facing the planet. The aim is for all schools to be \u2018Sustainable Schools\u2019 by 2020.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====Scotland====\nThe Scottish Government commissioned a\nclimate change TV advert, <ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Smb3jZUPHA</ref> possibly as part of public awareness program.{{OR|date=November 2019}}\n\n=== Republic of Korea ===\nThe Republic of Korea has a number of policies and initiatives supporting environmental education. In 2008, the Environmental Education Promotion Act encouraged the development of environmental education. It aimed to raise national environmental awareness, to encourage people to develop research and inquiry skills, and to put what they learn into action.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Ministry of Environment, in its 2011-2015 Environmental Education Master Plan, proposed a policy agenda for environmental education to be implemented through formal education, social environmental education and educational infrastructure approaches. The various approaches in the formal education area include:\n* \u2018Environment and Green Growth\u2019 as an elective subject in middle and high school curricula, and classes in elementary school designed to integrate environmental education; \n* the establishment of the Natural Environmental Studies Institute that o ers interactive youth programmes for environmental studies;\n* Environment Model Schools, designed to demonstrate best-practice;\n* \u2018Low Carbon Challenge\u2019 involving ten universities;\n* in-service training for teachers to upskill, specializing in environmental education.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== '''Vietnam''' ===\nThe development of ESD in Vietnam took place in the most recent decades. The National Council of Sustainable Development was formed in 2006 to acknowledge the United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (DESD) (<ref name=\":04\">{{Cite web|url=https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000190101|title=Climate change education for sustainable development: the UNESCO climate change initiative|last=|first=|date=|website=unesdoc.unesco.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>). A committee consisting of high-ranking leaders such as government leaders and ministers were appointed to develop an education for sustainability guideline.\n\nThe Ministry for Education and Training (MOET) played an important role to push forward establishment goals for ESD and CCE. Furthermore, they were also able to recognize the climate change impacts overall in Vietnam such as increase in average temperature and sea rise level. From 1951-2000, Vietnam\u2019s global average temperature increased about 0.5-0.7 Celsius, and sea level had risen about 20 cm (<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite journal|date=2014|editor-last=Shaw|editor-first=Rajib|editor2-last=Oikawa|editor2-first=Yukihiko|title=Education for Sustainable Development and Disaster Risk Reduction|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-4-431-55090-7|journal=Disaster Risk Reduction|doi=10.1007/978-4-431-55090-7|issn=2196-4106}}</ref>). These two factors had put a hold on the growing socioeconomic achievements; therefore, MOET acted on the development education aspects to mitigate climate change in the future (<ref name=\":12\" />). The first key steps MOET promoted toward ESD and CCE were ''the National Action Plan of Education for Sustainable Development of Viet Nam in 2010 and the Action Plan for Response to Climate Change of the Education Sector for the period of 2011-2015 (''<ref name=\":04\" />'').''\n\n''Action Plan of Education for Sustainable Development''\n\nIn 2016, Vietnam, Costa Rica, and Kenya started their partnership with UNESCO to establish high standard ESD policies at a regional and global level (<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/focussdgs.html|title=UNESCO Global Action Programme On Education For Sustainable Development|last=|first=|date=10 February 2020|website=UNESCO Digital library|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>). Through UNESCO, there were four main projects that the countries can get involved in different socioeconomic levels such as ''Advancing ESD policy development,  A whole-institution approach to climate change through the UNESCO Associated Schools Network (ASPnet), Sustainability starts with teachers, Empower youth ESD leaders as change agents, and Community for ESD.''\n\n\n\n''Climate Change Education''\n\n\u00a0 In 2009, MOET was able to develop and implement environmental education (EE) and CCE education into formal education curriculum. This gained approval from ESD standpoints (<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/themes/education-sustainable-development|title=Education for Sustainable Development|last=https://plus.google.com/+UNESCO|date=2013-05-10|website=UNESCO|language=en|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/focussdgs.html|title=Proposal for Sustainable Development Goals .:.

From 1951-2000, Vietnam\u2019s global average temperature increased about 0.5-0.7 Celsius, and sea level had risen about 20 cm (<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite journal|date=2014|editor-last=Shaw|editor-first=Rajib|editor2-last=Oikawa|editor2-first=Yukihiko|title=Education for Sustainable Development and Disaster Risk Reduction|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-4-431-55090-7|journal=Disaster Risk Reduction|doi=10.1007/978-4-431-55090-7|issn=2196-4106}}</ref>).

Interest in [[local currency]] moved on to other designs such as [[time-based currency]] and dollar-backed local voucher schemes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n===Internet networks===\nOn the whole, the movement was slow to adapt to the internet and to the possibility of networking together. Reluctance to engage with technology, a belief in decentralisation/localisation and lack of funds all contributed to this.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nExamples of LETS networks based on free software are the [[Cape Town]]-based [[Community Exchange System]] (CES), which {{as of|lc=yes|March 2019}} links to the [[Geneva]]-based Community Forge<ref>[http://communityforge.net/ CommunityForge]</ref> and [[Spain|Spanish]]  IntegralCES.<ref>[http://integralces.net/]</ref><ref name=CESstats/>\n\n== Criteria ==\n\nLETS networks facilitate exchange between members by providing a directory of offers and needs and by allowing a line of [[interest]]-free credit to each. Members' [[IOU]]s are logged in a centralised accounting system which publishes a directory as well as balances visible to all members. In case of a default, the loss of value or units is absorbed equally by all members, which makes it a [[mutual credit]] exchange. For instance, a member may earn credit by doing childcare for one person and spend it later on carpentry with another person in the same network, or they may spend first and earn later.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nIn many countries, the distinction between LETS and [[timebanking]] is not clear, as many LETS use time as their unit of account.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nAs per Linton's definition, LETS are generally considered to have the following five fundamental criteria:<ref name=\"LETS1\"/>\n* Cost of service: from the community for the community\n* Consent: there is no compulsion to trade\n* Disclosure: information about balances is available to all members\n* Equivalence to the national currency\n* No interest\n\nAccording to a 1996 survey by LetsLink UK, only 13% of LETS networks actually practise equivalence, with most groups establishing alternative systems of valuation \"in order to divorce [themselves] entirely from the mainstream economy.\"<ref>{{Cite book| first=Jonathan | last=Croall | year=1997 | title=LETS Act Locally | publisher=Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation | isbn=0-903319-81-0}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| first=Peter | last=Lang | year=1994 | title=LETS Work: Rebuilding the Local Economy | publisher=Grover Books | isbn=1-899233-00-8}}</ref> Michael Linton has stated that such systems are \"personal money\" networks rather than LETS.<ref name=\"LETS1\" />\n\n== Operation ==\nA list of services offered by network members is put together to create a LETS scheme, and trading takes place between members using a local currency. The LETS foundation is a virtual currency, a check book, a directory as well as a transparent accounting system built on trust and community regulation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=North |first1=Peter |title=Explorations in heterotopia: Local Exchange Trading Schemes (LETS) and the micropolitics of money and livelihood |journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space |date=1999 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=69\u201386 |doi=10.1068/d170069 |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1068/d170069 |issn=0263-7758}}</ref>\nThe first LETS required nothing more than a telephone, an answering machine and a notebook.<ref>{{cite podcast|url=http://media.blubrry.com/extraenvironmentalist/p/extraenvironmentalist.com/audio/low/Ep45_final_lowbitrate.mp3 |title=Opening Money |host=The Extraenvironmentalist |date=2012-11-07}}</ref> Since then, there have been several attempts to improve the process with software, printed notes, and other familiar aspects of traditional currencies.\n# Local people set up an organization to trade between themselves, often paying a small membership fee to cover administration costs\n# Members maintain a directory of offers and wants to help facilitate trades\n# Upon trading, members may 'pay' each other with printed notes, log the transaction in log books or online, or  write cheques which are later cleared by the system accountant.\n# Members whose balances exceed specified limits (positive or negative) are obliged to move their balance back towards zero by spending or earning.\n\nLETS is a full-fledged monetary or exchange system, unlike direct [[barter (economics)|barter]]. LETS members are able to earn credits from any member and spend them with anyone else on the scheme. Since the details are worked out by the users, there is much variation between schemes.\n\nLETS is not a scheme for avoiding the payment of taxation, and generally groups encourage all members to personally undertake their liabilities to the state for all taxation, including income tax and goods and services tax.  In a number of countries, various government taxation authorities have examined LETS along with other forms of [[counter trade]], and made rulings concerning their use. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}  Generally for personal arrangements, social arrangements, hobbies or pastimes, there are no taxation implications.  This generally covers the vast majority of LETS transactions.{{Disputed inline|Tax|date=May 2010}}  Taxation liabilities accrue when a [[tradesperson]] or professional person provides his or her professional services in payment for LETS units, or a registered or incorporated business sells part of its product for LETS units.  In such cases, the businesses are generally encouraged to sell the service or product partly for LETS units and partly in the national currency, to allow the payment of all required taxation. This does imply, however, that in situations where national-currency expenditures would be tax-deductible, LETS must be as well.\n\nIn a number of countries, LETS have been encouraged as a social security initiative.  For example, in Australia, [[Peter Baldwin (politician)|Peter Baldwin]], a former Minister of Social Security in the Keating government, encouraged LETS as a way of letting welfare recipients borrow against their welfare entitlement for urgent personal needs or to establish themselves in business.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\nSince their commencement over 30 years ago, LETS have been highly innovative in adapting to the needs of their local communities in all kinds of ways.  For example, in Australia, people have built houses using LETS in place of a bank [[mortgage loan|mortgage]], freeing the owner from onerous interest payments.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\n== Benefits ==\nLETS can help [[community building|revitalise and build community]] by allowing a wider cross-section of the [[community]]\u2014individuals, small businesses, local services and [[Non-profit organization|voluntary group]]s\u2014to save money and resources in cooperation with others and extend their purchasing power. Other benefits may include social contact, health care, tuition and training, support for local enterprise and new businesses. One goal of this approach is to stimulate the economies of economically depressed towns that have goods and services, but little official currency: the LETS scheme does not require outside sources of income as stimulus.\nThe environmental benefits of enhanced locals' self-reliance involve less-distance transport (as local goods are substituted for imports) and more evident environmental effects. Moreover, diverse local economies support sustainability by decreasing the need to use assets in an inefficient manner to satisfy external consumer demands. That also requires improving the local [[Quality_of_life]] without having to make expenditures.  There is no doubt that LETS allow much greater self-direction and flexibility in employment patterns than the mainstream, conventional economy and, in particular, enable the skills of the unemployed to be valued and used.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Seyfang |first1=Gill J. |title=Local Exchange Trading Systems and Sustainable Development |journal=Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development |date=1 March 1996 |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=5\u201345 |doi=10.1080/00139157.1996.9933457 |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00139157.1996.9933457?journalCode=venv20 |issn=0013-9157}}</ref>\n\n== Limitations ==\nEven though LETS are strongly oriented towards the formal market economy, they disengage from it by establishing small, cooperative exchange enclaves in which trust and intimacy relationships are cultivated. And it also means that there is a small range of services available. LETS members must be economically involved outside to meet their needs.

Interest in [[local currency]] moved on to other designs such as [[time-based currency]] and dollar-backed local voucher schemes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n===Internet networks===\nOn the whole, the movement was slow to adapt to the internet and to the possibility of networking together. Reluctance to engage with technology, a belief in decentralisation/localisation and lack of funds all contributed to this.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nExamples of LETS networks based on free software are the [[Cape Town]]-based [[Community Exchange System]] (CES), which {{as of|lc=yes|March 2019}} links to the [[Geneva]]-based Community Forge<ref>[http://communityforge.net/ CommunityForge]</ref> and [[Spain|Spanish]]  IntegralCES.<ref>[http://integralces.net/]</ref><ref name=CESstats/>\n\n== Criteria ==\n\nLETS networks facilitate exchange between members by providing a directory of offers and needs and by allowing a line of [[interest]]-free credit to each. Members' [[IOU]]s are logged in a centralised accounting system which publishes a directory as well as balances visible to all members. In case of a default, the loss of value or units is absorbed equally by all members, which makes it a [[mutual credit]] exchange. For instance, a member may earn credit by doing childcare for one person and spend it later on carpentry with another person in the same network, or they may spend first and earn later.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nIn many countries, the distinction between LETS and [[timebanking]] is not clear, as many LETS use time as their unit of account.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nAs per Linton's definition, LETS are generally considered to have the following five fundamental criteria:<ref name=\"LETS1\"/>\n* Cost of service: from the community for the community\n* Consent: there is no compulsion to trade\n* Disclosure: information about balances is available to all members\n* Equivalence to the national currency\n* No interest\n\nAccording to a 1996 survey by LetsLink UK, only 13% of LETS networks actually practise equivalence, with most groups establishing alternative systems of valuation \"in order to divorce [themselves] entirely from the mainstream economy.\"<ref>{{Cite book| first=Jonathan | last=Croall | year=1997 | title=LETS Act Locally | publisher=Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation | isbn=0-903319-81-0}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| first=Peter | last=Lang | year=1994 | title=LETS Work: Rebuilding the Local Economy | publisher=Grover Books | isbn=1-899233-00-8}}</ref> Michael Linton has stated that such systems are \"personal money\" networks rather than LETS.<ref name=\"LETS1\" />\n\n== Operation ==\nA list of services offered by network members is put together to create a LETS scheme, and trading takes place between members using a local currency. The LETS foundation is a virtual currency, a check book, a directory as well as a transparent accounting system built on trust and community regulation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=North |first1=Peter |title=Explorations in heterotopia: Local Exchange Trading Schemes (LETS) and the micropolitics of money and livelihood |journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space |date=1999 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=69\u201386 |doi=10.1068/d170069 |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1068/d170069 |issn=0263-7758}}</ref>\nThe first LETS required nothing more than a telephone, an answering machine and a notebook.<ref>{{cite podcast|url=http://media.blubrry.com/extraenvironmentalist/p/extraenvironmentalist.com/audio/low/Ep45_final_lowbitrate.mp3 |title=Opening Money |host=The Extraenvironmentalist |date=2012-11-07}}</ref> Since then, there have been several attempts to improve the process with software, printed notes, and other familiar aspects of traditional currencies.\n# Local people set up an organization to trade between themselves, often paying a small membership fee to cover administration costs\n# Members maintain a directory of offers and wants to help facilitate trades\n# Upon trading, members may 'pay' each other with printed notes, log the transaction in log books or online, or  write cheques which are later cleared by the system accountant.\n# Members whose balances exceed specified limits (positive or negative) are obliged to move their balance back towards zero by spending or earning.\n\nLETS is a full-fledged monetary or exchange system, unlike direct [[barter (economics)|barter]]. LETS members are able to earn credits from any member and spend them with anyone else on the scheme. Since the details are worked out by the users, there is much variation between schemes.\n\nLETS is not a scheme for avoiding the payment of taxation, and generally groups encourage all members to personally undertake their liabilities to the state for all taxation, including income tax and goods and services tax.  In a number of countries, various government taxation authorities have examined LETS along with other forms of [[counter trade]], and made rulings concerning their use. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}  Generally for personal arrangements, social arrangements, hobbies or pastimes, there are no taxation implications.  This generally covers the vast majority of LETS transactions.{{Disputed inline|Tax|date=May 2010}}  Taxation liabilities accrue when a [[tradesperson]] or professional person provides his or her professional services in payment for LETS units, or a registered or incorporated business sells part of its product for LETS units.  In such cases, the businesses are generally encouraged to sell the service or product partly for LETS units and partly in the national currency, to allow the payment of all required taxation. This does imply, however, that in situations where national-currency expenditures would be tax-deductible, LETS must be as well.\n\nIn a number of countries, LETS have been encouraged as a social security initiative.  For example, in Australia, [[Peter Baldwin (politician)|Peter Baldwin]], a former Minister of Social Security in the Keating government, encouraged LETS as a way of letting welfare recipients borrow against their welfare entitlement for urgent personal needs or to establish themselves in business.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\nSince their commencement over 30 years ago, LETS have been highly innovative in adapting to the needs of their local communities in all kinds of ways.  For example, in Australia, people have built houses using LETS in place of a bank [[mortgage loan|mortgage]], freeing the owner from onerous interest payments.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\n== Benefits ==\nLETS can help [[community building|revitalise and build community]] by allowing a wider cross-section of the [[community]]\u2014individuals, small businesses, local services and [[Non-profit organization|voluntary group]]s\u2014to save money and resources in cooperation with others and extend their purchasing power. Other benefits may include social contact, health care, tuition and training, support for local enterprise and new businesses. One goal of this approach is to stimulate the economies of economically depressed towns that have goods and services, but little official currency: the LETS scheme does not require outside sources of income as stimulus.\nThe environmental benefits of enhanced locals' self-reliance involve less-distance transport (as local goods are substituted for imports) and more evident environmental effects. Moreover, diverse local economies support sustainability by decreasing the need to use assets in an inefficient manner to satisfy external consumer demands. That also requires improving the local [[Quality_of_life]] without having to make expenditures.  There is no doubt that LETS allow much greater self-direction and flexibility in employment patterns than the [[Traditional_economy]] and, in particular, enable the skills of the unemployed to be valued and used.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Seyfang |first1=Gill J. |title=Local Exchange Trading Systems and Sustainable Development |journal=Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development |date=1 March 1996 |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=5\u201345 |doi=10.1080/00139157.1996.9933457 |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00139157.1996.9933457?journalCode=venv20 |issn=0013-9157}}</ref>\n\n== Limitations ==\nEven though LETS are strongly oriented towards the formal market economy, they disengage from it by establishing small, cooperative exchange enclaves in which trust and intimacy relationships are cultivated. And it also means that there is a small range of services available. LETS members must be economically involved outside to meet their needs.

Fomalhaut b has subsequently been described as a low-mass planet whose surrounding dust cloud is entirely responsible for its detection or, most recently, debris from a [[Disrupted planet|collision]] of [[asteroid]]s instead.  <ref name=\"NYT-20200420\">{{cite news |last=Andrews |first=Robin Goerge |title=The Case of the Disappearing Exoplanet - Fomalhaut b was one of the first planets around another star to be directly imaged by telescopes.

Here, the former explains most of the 0.6&nbsp;\u03bcm brightness and planet thermal emission contributes to much of the 0.8&nbsp;\u03bcm brightness. Their non-detections with ground-based infrared data suggested that Fomalhaut b had to be less massive than about 3 Jupiter masses.\n\nHowever, Fomalhaut b should be detectable in space-based infrared data if its mass is between 1-3 Jupiter masses.  But sensitive infrared Spitzer Space Telescope observations failed to detect Fomalhaut b, implying that Fomalhaut b has less than 1 Jupiter mass.<ref name=\"Janson2012\"/>  Furthermore, although the planet was thought to be a plausible explanation for Fomalhaut's eccentric debris ring, measurements in the Kalas et al. paper hinted that it was moving too fast (i.e. not apsidally aligned) for this explanation to work.  Finally, researchers analyzing September\u2013October 2011 [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]] (ALMA) data for Fomalhaut's debris ring suggested an alternate hypothesis: that the ring could be shaped by much smaller, shepherding planets, neither of which needed to be Fomalhaut b.<ref name=\"Boley2012\">{{Cite journal |title=Constraining the Planetary System of Fomalhaut Using High-resolution ALMA Observations |first=Aaron |last=Boley |journal=Astrophysical Journal |date=2012 |arxiv = 1204.0007|bibcode = 2012ApJ...750L..21B |doi = 10.1088/2041-8205/750/1/L21 |volume=750 |pages=L21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=36681 |title=ALMA Reveals Workings of Nearby Planetary System |accessdate=2012-04-18}}</ref>  These results invoked skepticism about Fomalhaut b's status as an extrasolar planet.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20945-new-doubts-about-poster-child-of-exoplanets.html |author=Lisa Grossman |title=New doubts about 'poster child' of exoplanets |journal=New Scientist |publisher=Reed Business Information Ltd. |date=21 September 2011 |accessdate=2013-12-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Yudhijit Bhattacharjee |title=Celebrated Exoplanet Vanishes in a Cloud of Dust-Or Maybe Not |journal=Science |page=515 |volume=335 |date=3 February 2012 |bibcode = 2012Sci...335..515B |doi = 10.1126/science.335.6068.515 |issue=6068}}</ref>\n\n==Recovery, independent confirmation by Hubble and further additional findings==\nOn October 24, 2012, a team led by Thayne Currie at the [[University of Toronto]] announced the first independent recovery of Fomalhaut b and revived the claim that Fomalhaut b identifies a planet.<ref name=\"Currie\"/> They reanalyzed the original Hubble data using new, more powerful algorithms for separating planet light from starlight and confirmed that Fomalhaut b does exist. They also provided a new detection of Fomalhaut b at 0.4&nbsp;\u00b5m.\nThey modeled the optical detections and infrared upper limits for Fomalhaut b, showing that Fomalhaut b's emission can be completely explained by starlight scattered by small dust and arguing that this dust surrounds an unseen planetary-mass object.   Thus, they consider Fomalhaut b to plausibly be a \"planet identified from direct imaging\" even if Fomalhaut b is not, strictly speaking, a directly imaged planet insofar as the light does not come from a planetary atmosphere.<ref name=\"Currie\"/>\n\nA second paper made public a day later and led by Raphael Galicher and Christian Marois at the [[Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics]] also independently recovered Fomalhaut b and confirmed the new 0.4&nbsp;\u00b5m detection, claiming the spectral energy distribution (SED) of Fomalhaut b cannot be explained as due to direct or scattered radiation from a massive planet. They considered two models to explain the SED: (1) a large circumplanetary disk around a massive, but unseen, planet and (2) the aftermath of a collision during the past 100 years of two Kuiper belt objects of radii about 50&nbsp;km.<ref name=\"Galicher\"/>\n\nSubsequent Hubble data obtained in 2010 and 2012 with the [[STIS]] instrument by [[Paul Kalas]] and collaborators again recovered Fomalhaut b<ref name=\"Kalas2013\"/>.   However, analysis of Fomalhaut b's astrometry showed that the object has a high eccentricity (e = 0.8), its orbit (projected on the sky) crosses the plane of Fomalhaut's debris ring, and thus it is unlikely to be the object sculpting the debris ring's sharp inner edge.  Fomalhaut b's high eccentricity may be evidence for a significant dynamical interaction with a hitherto unseen planet at a smaller orbital separation.\n\nAnalyses of additional [[STIS]] data obtained in 2013 and 2014 argue that Fomalhaut b is fading and expanding in size, a behavior that may support the interpretation of Fomalhaut b as a collision between two asteroid-sized objects <ref name=\"PNAS-20200420\"/>.\n\nThe revival of the claim that Fomalhaut b is (possibly) a planet after it had been discounted led some to nickname the object a \"zombie planet\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/fomalhaut-exo.html|work=NASA |title= New Study Brings a Doubted Exoplanet 'Back from the Dead'|accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref> although this is a non-technical term used in press material and does not appear in any peer-reviewed manuscript.\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\nAssuming that Fomalhaut b's orbit is in the same plane as the debris disk located exterior to it, it orbits [[Fomalhaut]] at a distance of approximately {{convert|115|AU|km mi|lk=in|abbr=on}}.

However, longer-term monitoring of Fomalhaut b may show evidence that the object is fading with time <ref name=\"PNAS-20200420\"/>.\n\nIn order for Fomalhaut b to be detectable at optical wavelengths, it must have an emitting area much larger than the physical size of a planet,<ref name=\"Kalas2008\"/> a fact further strengthening the case that what we see as Fomalhaut b is not light coming from a planetary atmosphere.

Models of Fomalhaut b sculpting the star's debris disk give a mass 0.5 times that of Jupiter.

Here, the former explains most of the 0.6&nbsp;\u03bcm brightness and planet thermal emission contributes to much of the 0.8&nbsp;\u03bcm brightness. Their non-detections with ground-based infrared data suggested that Fomalhaut b had to be less massive than about 3 Jupiter masses.\n\nHowever, Fomalhaut b should be detectable in space-based infrared data if its mass is between 1-3 Jupiter masses.  But sensitive infrared Spitzer Space Telescope observations failed to detect Fomalhaut b, implying that Fomalhaut b has less than 1 Jupiter mass.<ref name=\"Janson2012\"/>  Furthermore, although the planet was thought to be a plausible explanation for Fomalhaut's eccentric debris ring, measurements in the Kalas et al. paper hinted that it was moving too fast (i.e. not apsidally aligned) for this explanation to work.  Finally, researchers analyzing September\u2013October 2011 [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]] (ALMA) data for Fomalhaut's debris ring suggested an alternate hypothesis: that the ring could be shaped by much smaller, shepherding planets, neither of which needed to be Fomalhaut b.<ref name=\"Boley2012\">{{Cite journal |title=Constraining the Planetary System of Fomalhaut Using High-resolution ALMA Observations |first=Aaron |last=Boley |journal=Astrophysical Journal |date=2012 |arxiv = 1204.0007|bibcode = 2012ApJ...750L..21B |doi = 10.1088/2041-8205/750/1/L21 |volume=750 |pages=L21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=36681 |title=ALMA Reveals Workings of Nearby Planetary System |accessdate=2012-04-18}}</ref>  These results invoked skepticism about Fomalhaut b's status as an extrasolar planet.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20945-new-doubts-about-poster-child-of-exoplanets.html |author=Lisa Grossman |title=New doubts about 'poster child' of exoplanets |journal=New Scientist |publisher=Reed Business Information Ltd. |date=21 September 2011 |accessdate=2013-12-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Yudhijit Bhattacharjee |title=Celebrated Exoplanet Vanishes in a Cloud of Dust-Or Maybe Not |journal=Science |page=515 |volume=335 |date=3 February 2012 |bibcode = 2012Sci...335..515B |doi = 10.1126/science.335.6068.515 |issue=6068}}</ref>\n\n==Recovery, independent confirmation by Hubble and further additional findings==\nOn October 24, 2012, a team led by Thayne Currie at the [[University of Toronto]] announced the first independent recovery of Fomalhaut b and revived the claim that Fomalhaut b identifies a planet.<ref name=\"Currie\"/> They reanalyzed the original Hubble data using new, more powerful algorithms for separating planet light from starlight and confirmed that Fomalhaut b does exist. They also provided a new detection of Fomalhaut b at 0.4&nbsp;\u00b5m.\nThey modeled the optical detections and infrared upper limits for Fomalhaut b, showing that Fomalhaut b's emission can be completely explained by starlight scattered by small dust and arguing that this dust surrounds an unseen planetary-mass object.   Thus, they consider Fomalhaut b to plausibly be a \"planet identified from direct imaging\" even if Fomalhaut b is not, strictly speaking, a directly imaged planet insofar as the light does not come from a planetary atmosphere.<ref name=\"Currie\"/>\n\nA second paper made public a day later and led by Raphael Galicher and Christian Marois at the [[Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics]] also independently recovered Fomalhaut b and confirmed the new 0.4&nbsp;\u00b5m detection, claiming the spectral energy distribution (SED) of Fomalhaut b cannot be explained as due to direct or scattered radiation from a massive planet. They considered two models to explain the SED: (1) a large circumplanetary disk around a massive, but unseen, planet and (2) the aftermath of a collision during the past 100 years of two Kuiper belt objects of radii about 50&nbsp;km.<ref name=\"Galicher\"/>\n\nSubsequent Hubble data obtained in 2010 and 2012 with the [[STIS]] instrument by [[Paul Kalas]] and collaborators again recovered Fomalhaut b<ref name=\"Kalas2013\"/>.   However, analysis of Fomalhaut b's astrometry showed that the object has a high eccentricity (e = 0.8), its orbit (projected on the sky) crosses the plane of Fomalhaut's debris ring, and thus it is unlikely to be the object sculpting the debris ring's sharp inner edge.  Fomalhaut b's high eccentricity may be evidence for a significant dynamical interaction with a hitherto unseen planet at a smaller orbital separation.\n\nAnalyses of additional [[STIS]] data obtained in 2013 and 2014 argue that Fomalhaut b is fading and expanding in size, a behavior that may support the interpretation of Fomalhaut b as a collision between two asteroid-sized objects <ref name=\"PNAS-20200420\"/>.\n\nThe revival of the claim that Fomalhaut b is (possibly) a planet after it had been discounted led some to nickname the object a \"zombie planet\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/fomalhaut-exo.html|work=NASA |title= New Study Brings a Doubted Exoplanet 'Back from the Dead'|accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref> although this is a non-technical term used in press material and does not appear in any peer-reviewed manuscript.\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\nAssuming that Fomalhaut b's orbit is in the same plane as the debris disk located exterior to it, it orbits [[Fomalhaut]] at a distance of approximately {{convert|115|AU|km mi|lk=in|abbr=on}}.

It is almost nothing, if you will, even compared with other Jewish dialects, [[Judeo-Spanish]] for instance, that are more or less used literally; all this is true, but from the linguistic point of view, Judeo-German is worth as much as Judeo-Italian [{{lang|it|giudeo-italiano}}], to name it so, since for the [[Philology|glottological science]] the different forms of human speech are important in themselves and not by its number of speakers or the artistic forms they are used in. Moreover, a remarkable difference between Judeo-German and Judeo-Italian [{{lang|it|giudeo-italiano}}], that is also valuable from the scientific point of view, is that while the former is so different from German as to constitute an independent dialect, the latter by contrast is not essentially a different thing from the language of Italy, or from the individual dialects of the different provinces of Italy&nbsp;....

The use of words for 'school' to mean 'synagogue' dates back to the [[Roman Empire]]. The Judeo-Italian distinction between {{lang|itk|scola}} and {{lang|itk|scuola}} parallels the Standard Yiddish distinction between {{lang|yi|shul/shil}} for 'synagogue' and {{lang|yi|shule}} for 'school'. Another example is Yiddish {{lang|yi|iente}}, from the Judeo-Italian {{lang|itk|yientile}} ('[[gentile]]', 'non-Jew', 'Christian'), as differentiated from the standard Italian {{lang|it|gentile}}, meaning 'noble', 'gentleman'.<ref>[http://www.jochnowitz.net/Essays/yiddaily.html www.jochnowitz.net]</ref>\n\n==Dialects==\nJudeo-Italian regional dialects ({{lang|it|ghettaioli}}, {{lang|it|giudeeschi}}), include:\n* [[Judeo-Ferraran]] ({{lang|itk|giudeo-ferrarese}}) in [[Ferrara]]\n* [[Judeo-Florentine]] ({{lang|itk|giudeo-fiorentino}}, {{lang|it|iodiesco}}) in [[Florence]]\n* [[Judeo-Mantuan]] ({{lang|itk|giudeo-mantovano}}) in [[Mantua]]\n* [[Judeo-Modenan]] ({{lang|itk|giudeo-modenese}}) in [[Modena]]\n* [[Judeo-Piedmontese]] ({{lang|itk|giudeo-piemontese}}) in the region of [[Piedmont]]\n* [[Judeo-Reggian]] ({{lang|itk|giudeo-reggiano}}) in the region of [[Reggio Emilia]] of [[Emilia-Romagna]]\n* [[Judeo-Roman]] ({{lang|itk|giudeo-romanesco}}) in [[Rome]]\n* [[Judeo-Venetian]] ({{lang|itk|giudeo-veneziano}}) in [[Venice]]\n* [[Bagitto]] ({{lang|itk|giudeo-livornese}}) in [[Livorno]]\n\nAt least two Judeo-Italian varieties, based on the [[Sicilian language|Salentino]] and [[Venetian language|Venetian]] languages, were also used in [[Corfu]]<ref>[http://archive/indo-european/europe/judeo-italian-corfiote/?searchterm=Judeo-Italian]{{Dead link|date=April 2011}}</ref>{{crossref| (see relevant section in [[Corfiot Italians#Italkian with Venetian/Apulian influences|Corfiot Italians]])}}.\n\n==Characteristics==\nAll of the spoken Judeo-Italian varieties used combination of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] verb stems with [[Italian language|Italian]] conjugations (e.g., {{lang|he|\u05d0\u05db\u05dc\u05e8}} {{lang|itk|akhlare}}, 'to eat'; {{lang|he|\u05d2\u05e0\u05d1\u05d9\u05e8}} {{lang|itk|gannaviare}}, 'to steal'; {{lang|he|\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8\u05e8}} {{lang|itk|dabberare}}, 'to speak'; {{lang|he-Latn|\u05dc\u05db\u05d8\u05d9\u05e8}} {{lang|itk|lekhtire}}, 'to go'). Similarly, there are abstract nouns such as {{lang|he-Latn|\u05d8\u05d5\u05d1\u05d6\u05d4}} {{lang|itk|tovezza}}, 'goodness'.  This feature is unique among [[Jewish languages]], although there are arguably parallels in [[Jewish English languages|Jewish English]] dialect.\n\nAlso common are lexical incorporations from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], particularly those applicable to daily life.  Terms from other Jewish languages such as [[Yiddish]] and [[Judeo-Spanish]] were also incorporated. Bagitto, the dialect of [[Livorno]], is particularly rich in [[loanword]]s from Judeo-Spanish and [[Judeo-Portuguese]].\n\nIt was claimed by Cassuto that most Judeo-Italian dialects reflect the Italian dialect of places further to the south, due to the fact that since the expulsion of the Jews from the [[Kingdom of Naples]], the general direction of Jewish migration in Italy had been northward.<ref name=\"Cassuto\" />\n\n== Use in works and publications ==\n\nOne of the most accessible ways to view the Judeo-Italian language is by looking at translations of [[Hebrew Bible|biblical texts]] such as the [[Torah]] and [[Hagiographa]].

In [[English language|English]], ''Judeo-Italian'' was first used by [[Lazaro Belleli]] in 1904 for his article '' Jud\u00e6o-Greek and Jud\u00e6o-Italian'' in the [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] (vol. 7, 310-313), describing the languages of the [[Jew]]s of [[Corfu]].<ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/8950-judaeo-greek-and-judaeo-italian Jud\u00e6o-Greek and Jud\u00e6o-Italian]</ref> In Italian, [[Giuseppe Cammeo]] referred to a ''Gergo giudaico-italiano'' in his 1909 article ''Studj dialettali''  (Vessillo Israelitico 57 (1909); the term first appears on p.&nbsp;169).  That same year, [[Umberto Cassuto]] used the term  ''giudeo-italiano'', in the following:\n\n:Actually, while the existence of a Jud\u00e6o-German dialect is universally known, almost nobody [[Transalpine|beyond the Alps]] suspects that the Italian Jews have, or at least had, not to say a dialect of their own, but at least a way of speaking with peculiar features. True, in practice its importance, limited to the everyday use of some thousand people, is almost nothing versus that of Jud\u00e6o-German, spoken by millions of individuals that often do not know any other language, and has  [[Yiddish literature|its own literature]], [[Yiddish press|its own journalism]], [[Yiddish theater|its own theater]], and thus, almost the importance of a real language... It is almost nothing, if you will, even compared with other Jewish dialects, [[Judaeo-Spanish|Jud\u00e6o-Spanish]] for instance, that are more or less used literally; all this is true, but from the linguistic point of view, Jud\u00e6o-German is worth as much as Jud\u00e6o-Italian [''giudeo-italiano''], to name it so, since for the [[philology|glottological science]] the different forms of human speech are important in themselves and not by its number of speakers or the artistic forms they are used in. Moreover, a remarkable difference between Jud\u00e6o-German and Jud\u00e6o-Italian [''giudeo-italiano''], that is also valuable from the scientific point of view, is that while the former is so different from German as to constitute an independent dialect, the latter by contrast is not essentially a different thing from the language of Italy, or from the individual dialects of the different provinces of Italy...\n:256:\n:...It was natural that the Jud\u00e6o-Italian jargon [''gergo giudeo-italiano''] would disappear in a short while.\n:([[Umberto Cassuto]] \u201cParlata ebraica.\u201d Vessillo Israelitico 57 (1909): 255-256)<ref name=\"Cassuto!\">''Infatti, mentre \u00e8 universalmente nota l\u2019esistenza di un dialetto giudeo-tedesco, quasi nessuno sospetta oltr\u2019alpe che gli ebrei italiani abbiano pure, o almeno abbiano avuto, non dir\u00f2 un loro dialetto, ma almeno una loro parlata con peculiari caratteri.

The Hebrew title of the 1609 Venice Haggadah uses the word \"italiano\" for the language of [[Leon of Modena|Leone Modena]]'s translation (u-fitrono bi-leshon i\u1e6dalyano; \u05d5\u05e4\u05ea\u05e8\u05d5\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d1\u05dc\u05e9\u05d5\u05df \u05d0\u05d9\u05d8\u05dc\u05d9\u05d0\u05e0\u05d5).\n*Other historic descriptions are \"''Latino''\" and \"''Volgare''\", both of which were commonly used in the Middle Ages to mean Italian in general.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishlanguages.org/judeo-italian |title=Judeo-Italian |publisher=jewishlanguages.org |accessdate=2019-09-26}}</ref>\n*After the institution of the [[Ghetto]] forced Jewish communities throughout Italy into segregation, the term '''ghettaiolo''' was identified with local Jewish varieties of regional dialects.\n*Another native name type is ''giudeesco'' (e.g., Judeo-Florentine ''iodiesco''; < *IUD\u00c6\u012cSCU[M], or an assimilation of the hiatus {{IPA|/a\u02c8e/}} *giudaesco < *IUDA\u012cSCU[M]).\n*The neologism '''Italkian''' was coined in 1942 by Solomon Birnbaum (''see [[#References|References]]''), who modelled the word on the modern Hebrew adjective  \u05d9\u05ea-/\u05d0\u05d8\u05dc\u05e7\u05d9 ''italki(t)'', \u201cItalian\u201d, from the middle Hebrew adjective \u05d0\u05d9\u05d8\u05dc\u05e7\u05d9  (< ITALICU[M]), \u201cItalic\u201d or \u201cRoman\u201d.\n\n==Influence on Yiddish==\nAccording to some scholars, there are some Judeo-Italian loan words that have found their way into [[Yiddish]].<ref name=\"Italian Dialect or Jewish Language?\"/> For example, the word in Judeo-Italian for \"synagogue\" is ''scola'', as opposed to \"school,\" which is ''scuola''. The use of words for \"school\" to mean \"synagogue\" dates back to the [[Roman Empire]]. The Judeo-Italian distinction between ''scola'' and ''scuola'' parallels the Standard Yiddish distinction between ''shul/shil'' for 'synagogue' and ''shule'' for 'school'. Another example is ''iente'', from the Judeo-Italian yientile, as differentiated from the standard Italian ''gentile'', meaning 'noble'.<ref>[http://www.jochnowitz.net/Essays/yiddaily.html www.jochnowitz.net]</ref>\n\n==Dialects==\nJudeo-Italian regional dialects (''ghettaioli'' ''giudeeschi''), including:\n* [[Judeo-Ferraran]] (giudeo-ferrarese) from [[Ferrara]]\n* [[Judeo-Florentine]] (giudeo-fiorentino, iodiesco) from [[Florence]]\n* [[Judeo-Mantuan]] (giudeo-mantovano) from [[Mantua]]\n* [[Judeo-Modenan]] (giudeo-modenese) from [[Modena]]\n* [[Judaeo-Piedmontese]] (giudeo-piemontese) from the region of [[Piedmont]]\n* [[Judeo-Reggian]] (giudeo-reggiano) from the region of [[Reggio Emilia]] in [[Emilia-Romagna]]\n* [[Judeo-Roman]] (giudeo-romanesco) from [[Rome]]\n* [[Judeo-Venetian]] (giudeo-veneziano) from [[Venice]].\n* [[Bagitto]] (giudeo-livornese) from [[Livorno]].\n\nAt least two Judeo-Italian varieties, based on [[Sicilian language|Salentino]] and [[Venetian language|Venetian]] varieties were also used in [[Corfu]]<ref>[http://archive/indo-european/europe/judeo-italian-corfiote/?searchterm=Judeo-Italian] {{Dead link|date=April 2011}}</ref> (see relevant section in [[Corfiot Italians#Italkian with Venetian/Apulian influences|Corfiot Italians]]).\n\n==Characteristics==\nAll of the spoken Judeo-Italian varieties used a unique (among [[Jewish languages]], although there are arguably parallels in [[Jewish English languages|Jewish English]] usage) combination of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] verb stems with [[Italian language|Italian]] conjugations (''e.g.'', \"\u05d0\u05db\u05dc\u05e8 ''akhlare''\", to eat; \"\u05d2\u05e0\u05d1\u05d9\u05e8 ''gannaviare''\", to steal; \"\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8\u05e8 ''dabberare''\", to speak; \"\u05dc\u05db\u05d8\u05d9\u05e8 ''lekhtire''\", to go). Similarly there are abstract nouns such as \"\u05d8\u05d5\u05d1\u05d6\u05d4 ''tovezza''\", goodness.\n\nAlso common are lexical incorporations from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], particularly those applicable to daily life.  Terms from other Jewish languages such as [[Yiddish]] and [[Judaeo-Spanish]] were also incorporated.\n\nBagitto, the dialect of [[Livorno]], is particularly rich in [[loanword]]s from Judaeo-Spanish and [[Judaeo-Portuguese]].\n\nIt was claimed by Cassuto that most Judeo-Italian dialects reflect the Italian dialect of places further to the south, due to the fact that since the expulsion of the Jews from the [[Kingdom of Naples]] the general direction of Jewish migration in Italy has been northward.\n\n== Visuals ==\n\nThe Judeo-Italian language can be found in a [[Haggadah]], a Jewish prayer book typically used during a seder. Judeo-Italian is represented in this [[1716 Venice Haggadah]]. <ref name=\"Venice Haggadah\">{{cite web|url=https://www.baumanrarebooks.com/rare-books/haggadah/seder-haggadah-shel-pesah/83168.aspx|title=Seder Haggadah Shel Pesah|website=Bauman Rare Books|accessdate=27 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Library of Congress/ISO information ==\n\"Italkian\" is not used by the [[Library of Congress]] as a subject heading, neither does it figure as a reference to Judeo-Italian.
