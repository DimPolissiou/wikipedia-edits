It is currently the training base of the [[North Melbourne Football Club]], an [[Australian rules football]] club, and up to the end of the [[1985 VFL season|1985 season]] it was used as the team's home ground for [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League]] (VFL) matches.\n\n==History==\n\nThe North Melbourne Recreation Reserve is an inner-suburban sporting facility which is distinguished by its long standing association with the [[North Melbourne Football Club]]; it has served as the home of North Melbourne for more than 125 years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Arden St History|url=http://www.nmfc.com.au/club/history/arden-st-history|publisher=North Melbourne Football Club|accessdate=2 January 2017}}</ref>\nthe North Melbourne cricket were also there but footy clubs are so selfish and need the grounds for 12months? when footy was created it was to get the cricketers fit for cricket season - cricket is more important\n\nNot much is known about the exact date that Arden St Oval was officially opened, but local history purports it as being as old as the suburb itself. The [[Hotham Cricket Club]] served as the ground's only tenants until 1882 when they amalgamated with the Hotham Football Club - as they were then known -  to effect improvements to the ground. Before then, the Hotham Football Club had been playing home matches at [[Royal Park, Melbourne|Royal Park]], near the present site of the Melbourne Zoo.\nThe first game of Australian football ever played at the ground took place on 29 April 1882, when Hotham defeated Royal Park. Three years later, the ground became permanently reserved to the Crown. The football and cricket clubs changed their names to North Melbourne on 23 March 1888, after the Town of Hotham reverted to the name of North Melbourne in August 1887.\n\nThe sharing agreement between the cricket and footy clubs was not all rosy, and by the late 1890s the two entities ended up in court over a dispute about the use of the cricket pavilion by a visiting football team. The court ruled in favour of the cricket club citing that since it was Crown land, it was illegal to fence off any part of it for the benefit of either party.\n\n[[File:ArdenSt1980.png|thumb|right|250px|Arden St in 1980.

By mid-1909, the control of the Recreation Reserve had shifted to the Parks and Gardens Committee of the Melbourne City Council, meaning that the State Minister for Lands had final say over the use of the reserve. In 1921, the [[Essendon Football Club]] attempted to move to the ground after its home ground, the [[East Melbourne Cricket Ground]], was [[1921 VFA season#Closure of the East Melbourne Cricket Ground|closed]], and the North Melbourne Football Club disbanded as it sought to amalgamate with Essendon; but the State Minister for Lands vetoed Essendon's move. This prompted Essendon to move to the [[Windy Hill, Essendon|Essendon Recreation Reserve]], and the re-formed North Melbourne returned the following season to Arden Street.\n\nIn 1922, management of the ground was transferred from the Melbourne City Council to the North Melbourne Football and Cricket Clubs. Improvements to the ground that year, made in an attempt to increase revenue, included the installation of hot showers in the change rooms.\n\nIn early 1925, North Melbourne was finally admitted to the [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League]] (VFL). The invitation to join the VFL came at a time when local support for the club was at an all-time high prompting further upgrading of facilities. This included the construction of the main grandstand in 1928, with seating for 2,000 spectators.\n\nIn 1965, North Melbourne [[1965 VFA season#North Melbourne's move to Coburg Oval|moved its playing and training base]] from the Arden Street Oval to [[Coburg City Oval|Coburg Oval]].<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|page=51|author=|date=30 March 1965|title=North gets lease}}</ref> The move was intended to be permanent, with some initial negotiations seeking long-term leases for up to 40 years,<ref name=\"sun3nov\">{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|page=34|author=|date=3 November 1964|title=North can have a new oval}}</ref> but it was ultimately cancelled after only eight months, and North Melbourne returned to the Arden Street Oval in 1966.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|page=51|author=|date=28 September 1965|title=Coburg to drop stand?}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|page=52|author=|date=29 September 1965|title=North to quit Coburg}}</ref>\n\nUntil the late 1960s, the 1906 and 1928 grandstands were the only major structures associated with the Recreation Reserve, until the construction of the new administration building and Social Club after 1966.<ref name=\"melbourne.vic.gov.au\">{{cite web|url=http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/opm/bc/CTEE/meetings/CaC_51_200602140700.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091014114500/http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/opm/bc/CTEE/meetings/CaC_51_200602140700.pdf |archivedate=14 October 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nThe North Melbourne Football Club continued to use the site as its home ground until 1985, when the club began using the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] for its home matches. The last VFL match was played there on 17 August 1985 when North Melbourne defeated [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] by 50 points. The record attendance at the ground is 35,116 in 1949. The highest score was North Melbourne's 29.19 (193) in 1983 versus [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]].\n\nThe club continued to maintain the Arden Street Oval as a training and administrative base after shifting home games away. From 2002 until 2010, the club based its administration to offices at [[Docklands Stadium]] (which was then serving as its home ground), before returning to upgraded Arden Street Oval offices in early 2010; but it has maintained Arden Street as its training base continuously throughout that time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nmfc.com.au/club/history/arden-st-history|title=Arden St history|publisher=North Melbourne Football Club|accessdate=21 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006 the ground became the subject of an arson attack, with several portable buildings including the gymnasium, coaches' offices and players' lounge being destroyed by fire in the early hours of 22 July, the morning after the Kangaroos suffered a 72-point loss to the [[Adelaide Football Club|Adelaide Crows]] at [[Football Park|AAMI Stadium]].

Remnants of this stand, the concrete players\u2019 race and the base of one of the external staircases, remain in the terraced area{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}. The players\u2019 race still connects the players\u2019 dressing rooms in the Football Club administration building with the oval.  In 1909, plans for a new grandstand, to cost \u00a31,000, were drawn up by local councillor and club founder [[James Henry Gardiner|J H Gardiner]]{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}. Despite the popularity of the club, it was deemed{{by whom|date=July 2015}} that too few finals games were scheduled for the ground to\nwarrant the construction of another stand{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}.\n\n===1928 Grand Stand===\n\nNorth's move to the VFL in 1925 prompted significant upgrading of the club's facilities.\nAlmost symbolic of the club's new status as a member of the VFL was the construction of the brick grandstand in 1928, with seating for 2,000 spectators. Located to the south-east of the existing 1906 stand, it was built on the site of the small timber pavilion, which was demolished, and another even smaller structure to the south-east which was apparently re-located elsewhere. The designer was H E Morton and the builder was J E Morison. \n[[File:WbNORTHstand gallery 470x313.jpg|thumb|right|125px|1928 Grandstand]]\n\nThe foundation stone reads as follows:<br>\nNORTH MELBOURNE RECREATION RESERVE<br>\nTHIS TABLET WAS UNVEILED BY THE<br>\nRIGHT HONORABLE THE LORD MAYOR OF MELBOURNE<br>\nALDERMAN SIR STEPHEN MORELL<br>\nON SATURDAY 24TH MARCH 1928<br>\nCOMMITTEE 1927-28\nCOUNCILLOR DR KENT HUGHES, CHAIRMAN<br>\nL.

MORTON, J. C. MORISON,<br>\nENGINEER BUILDER\n\nThe main grandstand seated prominent members and administrators of the football club up until the club stopped playing games there in 1984. From then on, it fell into disrepair and was eventually closed off to the public in 1991. It housed the club gym for a few years before bird droppings inside the roof began to present a safety hazard. The grandstand was eventually demolished in 2006 after failed attempts to find funds to repair the structure, much to the disappointment of the [[North-West Melbourne Association]]. A new administration and football facility was built in its place.<ref name=\"melbourne.vic.gov.au\" />\n\n===Harold R. Henderson Pavilion===\n[[File:Harold HendPav.JPG|thumb|right|125px|Harold Henderson Pavilion]]\nThe Harold R Henderson Pavilion is the latest stand to be built. It was constructed in the late '60s following the club's disastrous move to the Coburg City Oval. Led by Allen Aylett and Harold R. Henderson, a committee was formed that aimed to redevelop the ground so that there would never be a repeat of the club's relocation to Coburg. Along with new administration facilities, a new first rate social club was built that became the envy of other VFL clubs during the 70s.\n\nThe pavilion itself set a new benchmark in football standards, with the introduction of corporate hospitality where clients could enjoy the football in comfort. These improvements were responsible for the great success North achieved during the 70s.\n\nAfter 1985, the Pavilion was converted into the 'Kanga Kasino' that housed the clubs pokie machines. In 2002, North Melbourne acquired the Captain's Bar at the newly constructed Docklands Stadium, and the pokies were moved there. From 2002-2009 the Pavilion held the club gym, and North's official merchandise store the 'Roo Shop'.\n\nThe Pavilion was demolished in 2009 as part of the development of the oval.\n\n===Betting Ring===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:WbLANDMARK2 narrowweb 200x270.jpg|thumb|right|125px|Betting ring]] -->\nThe betting ring was a concreted area beneath a roof, behind the 1928 grandstand, on the corner of Arden and Fogarty streets. The betting ring was built for greyhound meetings that were held at Arden St from 1957-62. The dogs ran on a track that formed a perimeter around the cricket oval. While the betting ring was alive with punters and bookmakers, only those in the ring's top corner, at the northern end, had a view past the grandstand and across the terraces to the finishing line.\nAfter the demise of greyhound racing at Arden Street, the betting ring served as a car park and equipment shelter. Much of the area was taken up by the Bob Dempster Memorial Nets, which were built on the oval in 1975, before being shifted to the corner of the betting ring closest to the intersection of Arden and Fogarty streets. furniture.<ref name=\"theage.com.au\">http://www.theage.com.au/news/Sport/Betting-ring-Arden-Street/2005/05/06/1115092682894.html</ref>\n\nIn 2006, the betting ring was destroyed in an arson attack.\n\n===Outer Shed===\n\nAt the eastern goals, and along the Macaulay Street boundary, stood small shelters for the spectators. These shelters were demolished in the aftermath of the 1985 [[Bradford City stadium fire]] in England, when the Metropolitan Fire Brigade declared them a fire hazard.\n\n==The Gasometer==\n[[File:Gasometer1111.JPG|thumb|right|125px|Gasometer]]\n\nOne of the iconic{{POV statement|date=July 2015}} features of VFL football at Arden Street was the gigantic [[gasometer]] that towered over the ground. The giant gas works structure was located along Macaulay Road and became synonymous with [[North Melbourne]] in the football world{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}. The gasometer was so well known that [[Mick Nolan (footballer)|Mick Nolan]] was affectionately labelled the \"Galloping Gasometer\" by footy fans due to his large size and resemblance to the structure{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}.\n\n==Tenants==\nApart from its aborted move to Coburg in 1965, and times when the ground was being upgraded, the Arden St Oval has served as the permanent home of the North Melbourne Football \nClub from 1882 until now. Apart from this, boxing, cricket, cycling, hurling and greyhound racing have all been accommodated at Arden Street Oval at some stage.\n\nThe original tenant of the oval was the North Melbourne Cricket Club. The cricket club first started playing at the ground in 1868. The cricket club began to share the oval with the football club in 1882, with the football club using the oval in winter, and the cricket club using the oval in the summer. Historically this arrangement has been difficult and the North Melbourne cricket and football clubs have not got along. In 2007, the cricket club moved its First and Second XIs playing base to J. J. Holland Park in neighbouring [[Kensington, Victoria|Kensington]], but its Third and Fourth XIs remained at Arden Street; the club left Arden Street altogether in 2010,<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Age|title=North set to end a long tradition|author=Brad Beitzel|date=14 February 2010|accessdate=25 April 2014|url=http://www.theage.com.au/sport/cricket/north-set-to-end-a-long-tradition-20100213-nymy.html|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC}}</ref> playing and training nomadically at Holland Park, [[Albert Park and Lake|Albert Park]] and [[Royal Park, Melbourne|Royal Park]] for a couple of years<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/AboutCouncil/Meetings/Lists/CouncilMeetingAgendaItems/Attachments/9645/5.4.pdf|title=North Melbourne Recreation Reserve \u2013 Oval Redevelopment|date=13 March 2012|author=Graham Porteous|accessdate=25 April 2014}}</ref> before moving permanently to the outer north-western suburb of [[Greenvale, Victoria|Greenvale]] in 2013.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Hume Leader|title=Hume Leader looks back on the biggest stories of 2013|author=Liam McAleer|url=http://melbourne.vic.cricket.com.au/pageitem.aspx?id=76340&id2=1&eID=3&entityID=|accessdate=7 April 2014|date=31 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1957-62, the Melbourne Greyhound Racing Association used Arden St to hold its Greyhound meetings. The dogs ran on a track that formed a perimeter around the oval. Races were held on Monday nights and regularly attracted crowds of 5000, with double that number in attendance on the night when Rookie Rebel won the first Australian Cup in 1958. The Arden Street days are described as being the best in the history of Melbourne greyhound racing. Melbourne Greyhound Racing Association shifted its meetings to Olympic Park in 1962 after the Arden Street's ground committee sought to cash in on the popularity of the dogs by doubling the rent.<ref name=\"theage.com.au\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themeadows.org.au/aboutUs_history.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527062653/http://themeadows.org.au/aboutUs_history.php |archivedate=27 May 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nIn the winter of 1965, after North Melbourne had moved to Coburg, Arden Street Oval was rented by the VFL \u2013 in large part to prevent other football codes from renting it.

The upgraded facilities will also serve the community with a Gymnasium, Basketball Courts and Change rooms. The new administration of James Brayshaw worked with various Government agencies including the Melbourne City Council, Victorian State Government, and the Commonwealth Government to have the new facilities increased in size and value from the original $10 million, to a final plan costing $16 million, and providing the NMFC and local community with some of the best amenities of any club in the AFL.\n\nThe new development was opened in time for the 2010 season. The development includes offices for the football department and administration of the NMFC as well as training facilities. As housed in the building is a fencing centre, community gym, basketball court and 'The Huddle' which is a community learning centre.\n\nIn 2013 Arden Street was touted as a possible location for the proposed new 'boutique Stadium' in Melbourne. Other possible sites included [[Punt Road Oval]], home of the [[Richmond Football Club]].\n\nIn 2016, the [[North Melbourne Football Club]] announced they would be playing a game against [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] at Arden Street Oval as part of the 2017 pre-season competition.<ref>{{cite web|title=More Arden St footy?|url=http://www.nmfc.com.au/news/2016-12-08/more-arden-st-footy|publisher=North Melbourne Football Club|accessdate=24 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Edmund|first1=Sam|title=AFL pre-season fixture 2017: Who will your team play in the lead up to Round 1?|url=http://www.news.com.au/sport/afl/afl-preseason-fixture-2017-who-will-your-team-play-in-the-lead-up-to-round-1/news-story/2a73a7a4d996e19a47310a30e982b53b|website=news.com.au|accessdate=24 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Talent|first1=Justin|title=2017 AFL PRE-SEASON GAMES REVEALED|url=https://www.sen.com.au/news/2016/12/07/2017-afl-pre-season-games-revealed/|publisher=SEN|accessdate=24 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Pre-season fixture announced|url=http://www.hawthornfc.com.au/news/2016-12-07/preseason-fixture-announced|publisher=Hawthorn Football Club|accessdate=24 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*{{Austadiums|6}}\n*[http://afltables.com/afl/crowds/vn_arden_st.html VFL/AFL Attendance Records]\n*[http://afltables.com/afl/venues/arden_st.html Team Scoring Records]\n*[http://www.aroundthegrounds.bellestorie.com/arden/arden.html \"Around the Grounds\" - Web Documentary - Arden Street]\n\n{{North Melbourne Football Club}}\n{{AFL grounds}}\n{{MelbourneRacing}}\n\n[[Category:Defunct Australian Football League grounds]]\n[[Category:North Melbourne Football Club]]\n[[Category:Sports venues in Melbourne]]\n[[Category:Defunct greyhound racing venues in Australia]]\n[[Category:Defunct cricket grounds in Australia]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2015}}\n{{Use Australian English|date=January 2015}}\n{{Infobox venue\n| stadium_name      = Arden Street Oval\n| nickname          = \n| image             = [[File:Arden street from air.jpg|300px]]\n| caption           = Arden Street Oval from the air in 2007 (during redevelopment)\n| location          = Arden Street, [[North Melbourne, Victoria]]\n| coordinates       = {{coord|37|47|57|S|144|56|28|E|display=it}}\n| broke_ground      = 1850s\n| opened            = 1850s\n| closed            = \n| demolished        = \n| owner             = [[Melbourne City Council]]\n| operator          = [[North Melbourne Football Club]]\n| surface           = Grass\n| construction_cost = [[Australian dollar|A$]]16 m (Redevelopment)\n| architect         = Williams Ross Architects\n| tenants           = [[North Melbourne Football Club]] (1882-1964, 1966-present)<br>[[North Melbourne Cricket Club]] (1868-2008)<br>\n[[Hurling|Irish Hurling]] (1930s)<br>[[Melbourne Greyhound Racing Association]] (1957-1962)<br>[[Fencing Victoria]] (2010- )\n| seating_capacity  = 5,000<ref>{{cite web|title=Arden Street Oval|url=http://www.austadiums.com/stadiums/stadiums.php?id=6|publisher=Austadiums|accessdate=24 December 2016}}</ref>\n| record_attendance   = 35,116 ([[1949 VFL season#Round 19|27/8/1949]])\n| former_names      = Hotham Cricket Ground<br>North Melbourne Recreation Reserve<br>Aegis Park\n|}}\n\n'''Arden Street Oval''' (also known as '''North Melbourne Cricket Ground''') is a sports oval in [[North Melbourne, Victoria|North Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].

This prompted Essendon to move to the [[Windy Hill, Essendon|Essendon Recreation Reserve]], and the re-formed North Melbourne returned the following season to Arden Street.\n\nIn 1922, management of the ground was transferred from the Melbourne City Council to the North Melbourne Football and Cricket Clubs. Improvements to the ground that year, made in an attempt to increase revenue, included the installation of hot showers in the change rooms.\n\nIn early 1925, North Melbourne was finally admitted to the [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League]] (VFL). The invitation to join the VFL came at a time when local support for the club was at an all-time high prompting further upgrading of facilities. This included the construction of the main grandstand in 1928, with seating for 2,000 spectators.\n\nIn 1965, North Melbourne [[1965 VFA season#North Melbourne's move to Coburg Oval|moved its playing and training base]] from the Arden Street Oval to [[Coburg City Oval|Coburg Oval]].<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|page=51|author=|date=30 March 1965|title=North gets lease}}</ref> The move was intended to be permanent, with some initial negotiations seeking long-term leases for up to 40 years,<ref name=\"sun3nov\">{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|page=34|author=|date=3 November 1964|title=North can have a new oval}}</ref> but it was ultimately cancelled after only eight months, and North Melbourne returned to the Arden Street Oval in 1966.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|page=51|author=|date=28 September 1965|title=Coburg to drop stand?}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|page=52|author=|date=29 September 1965|title=North to quit Coburg}}</ref>\n\nUntil the late 1960s, the 1906 and 1928 grandstands were the only major structures associated with the Recreation Reserve, until the construction of the new administration building and Social Club after 1966.<ref name=\"melbourne.vic.gov.au\">{{cite web|url=http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/opm/bc/CTEE/meetings/CaC_51_200602140700.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091014114500/http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/opm/bc/CTEE/meetings/CaC_51_200602140700.pdf |archivedate=14 October 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nThe North Melbourne Football Club continued to use the site as its home ground until 1985, when the club began using the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] for its home matches. The last VFL match was played there on 17 August 1985 when North Melbourne defeated [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] by 50 points. The record attendance at the ground is 35,116 in 1949. The highest score was North Melbourne's 29.19 (193) in 1983 versus [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]].\n\nThe club continued to maintain the Arden Street Oval as a training and administrative base after shifting home games away. From 2002 until 2010, the club based its administration to offices at [[Docklands Stadium]] (which was then serving as its home ground), before returning to upgraded Arden Street Oval offices in early 2010; but it has maintained Arden Street as its training base continuously throughout that time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nmfc.com.au/club/history/arden-st-history|title=Arden St history|publisher=North Melbourne Football Club|accessdate=21 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006 the ground became the subject of an arson attack, with several portable buildings including the gymnasium, coaches' offices and players' lounge being destroyed by fire in the early hours of 22 July, the morning after the Kangaroos suffered a 72-point loss to the [[Adelaide Football Club|Adelaide Crows]] at [[Football Park|AAMI Stadium]].

Remnants of this stand, the concrete players\u2019 race and the base of one of the external staircases, remain in the terraced area{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}. The players\u2019 race still connects the players\u2019 dressing rooms in the Football Club administration building with the oval.  In 1909, plans for a new grandstand, to cost \u00a31,000, were drawn up by local councillor and club founder [[James Henry Gardiner|J H Gardiner]]{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}. Despite the popularity of the club, it was deemed{{by whom|date=July 2015}} that too few finals games were scheduled for the ground to\nwarrant the construction of another stand{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}.\n\n===1928 Grand Stand===\n\nNorth's move to the VFL in 1925 prompted significant upgrading of the club's facilities.\nAlmost symbolic of the club's new status as a member of the VFL was the construction of the brick grandstand in 1928, with seating for 2,000 spectators. Located to the south-east of the existing 1906 stand, it was built on the site of the small timber pavilion, which was demolished, and another even smaller structure to the south-east which was apparently re-located elsewhere. The designer was H E Morton and the builder was J E Morison. \n[[File:WbNORTHstand gallery 470x313.jpg|thumb|right|125px|1928 Grandstand]]\n\nThe foundation stone reads as follows:<br>\nNORTH MELBOURNE RECREATION RESERVE<br>\nTHIS TABLET WAS UNVEILED BY THE<br>\nRIGHT HONORABLE THE LORD MAYOR OF MELBOURNE<br>\nALDERMAN SIR STEPHEN MORELL<br>\nON SATURDAY 24TH MARCH 1928<br>\nCOMMITTEE 1927-28\nCOUNCILLOR DR KENT HUGHES, CHAIRMAN<br>\nL.

MORTON, J. C. MORISON,<br>\nENGINEER BUILDER\n\nThe main grandstand seated prominent members and administrators of the football club up until the club stopped playing games there in 1984. From then on, it fell into disrepair and was eventually closed off to the public in 1991. It housed the club gym for a few years before bird droppings inside the roof began to present a safety hazard. The grandstand was eventually demolished in 2006 after failed attempts to find funds to repair the structure, much to the disappointment of the [[North-West Melbourne Association]]. A new administration and football facility was built in its place.<ref name=\"melbourne.vic.gov.au\" />\n\n===Harold R. Henderson Pavilion===\n[[File:Harold HendPav.JPG|thumb|right|125px|Harold Henderson Pavilion]]\nThe Harold R Henderson Pavilion is the latest stand to be built. It was constructed in the late '60s following the club's disastrous move to the Coburg City Oval. Led by Allen Aylett and Harold R. Henderson, a committee was formed that aimed to redevelop the ground so that there would never be a repeat of the club's relocation to Coburg. Along with new administration facilities, a new first rate social club was built that became the envy of other VFL clubs during the 70s.\n\nThe pavilion itself set a new benchmark in football standards, with the introduction of corporate hospitality where clients could enjoy the football in comfort. These improvements were responsible for the great success North achieved during the 70s.\n\nAfter 1985, the Pavilion was converted into the 'Kanga Kasino' that housed the clubs pokie machines. In 2002, North Melbourne acquired the Captain's Bar at the newly constructed Docklands Stadium, and the pokies were moved there. From 2002-2009 the Pavilion held the club gym, and North's official merchandise store the 'Roo Shop'.\n\nThe Pavilion was demolished in 2009 as part of the development of the oval.\n\n===Betting Ring===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:WbLANDMARK2 narrowweb 200x270.jpg|thumb|right|125px|Betting ring]] -->\nThe betting ring was a concreted area beneath a roof, behind the 1928 grandstand, on the corner of Arden and Fogarty streets. The betting ring was built for greyhound meetings that were held at Arden St from 1957-62. The dogs ran on a track that formed a perimeter around the cricket oval. While the betting ring was alive with punters and bookmakers, only those in the ring's top corner, at the northern end, had a view past the grandstand and across the terraces to the finishing line.\nAfter the demise of greyhound racing at Arden Street, the betting ring served as a car park and equipment shelter. Much of the area was taken up by the Bob Dempster Memorial Nets, which were built on the oval in 1975, before being shifted to the corner of the betting ring closest to the intersection of Arden and Fogarty streets. furniture.<ref name=\"theage.com.au\">http://www.theage.com.au/news/Sport/Betting-ring-Arden-Street/2005/05/06/1115092682894.html</ref>\n\nIn 2006, the betting ring was destroyed in an arson attack.\n\n===Outer Shed===\n\nAt the eastern goals, and along the Macaulay Street boundary, stood small shelters for the spectators. These shelters were demolished in the aftermath of the 1985 [[Bradford City stadium fire]] in England, when the Metropolitan Fire Brigade declared them a fire hazard.\n\n==The Gasometer==\n[[File:Gasometer1111.JPG|thumb|right|125px|Gasometer]]\n\nOne of the iconic{{POV statement|date=July 2015}} features of VFL football at Arden Street was the gigantic [[gasometer]] that towered over the ground. The giant gas works structure was located along Macaulay Road and became synonymous with [[North Melbourne]] in the football world{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}. The gasometer was so well known that [[Mick Nolan (footballer)|Mick Nolan]] was affectionately labelled the \"Galloping Gasometer\" by footy fans due to his large size and resemblance to the structure{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}.\n\n==Tenants==\nApart from its aborted move to Coburg in 1965, and times when the ground was being upgraded, the Arden St Oval has served as the permanent home of the North Melbourne Football \nClub from 1882 until now. Apart from this, boxing, cricket, cycling, hurling and greyhound racing have all been accommodated at Arden Street Oval at some stage.\n\nThe original tenant of the oval was the North Melbourne Cricket Club. The cricket club first started playing at the ground in 1868. The cricket club began to share the oval with the football club in 1882, with the football club using the oval in winter, and the cricket club using the oval in the summer. Historically this arrangement has been difficult and the North Melbourne cricket and football clubs have not got along. In 2007, the cricket club moved its First and Second XIs playing base to J. J. Holland Park in neighbouring [[Kensington, Victoria|Kensington]], but its Third and Fourth XIs remained at Arden Street; the club left Arden Street altogether in 2010,<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Age|title=North set to end a long tradition|author=Brad Beitzel|date=14 February 2010|accessdate=25 April 2014|url=http://www.theage.com.au/sport/cricket/north-set-to-end-a-long-tradition-20100213-nymy.html|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC}}</ref> playing and training nomadically at Holland Park, [[Albert Park and Lake|Albert Park]] and [[Royal Park, Melbourne|Royal Park]] for a couple of years<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/AboutCouncil/Meetings/Lists/CouncilMeetingAgendaItems/Attachments/9645/5.4.pdf|title=North Melbourne Recreation Reserve \u2013 Oval Redevelopment|date=13 March 2012|author=Graham Porteous|accessdate=25 April 2014}}</ref> before moving permanently to the outer north-western suburb of [[Greenvale, Victoria|Greenvale]] in 2013.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Hume Leader|title=Hume Leader looks back on the biggest stories of 2013|author=Liam McAleer|url=http://melbourne.vic.cricket.com.au/pageitem.aspx?id=76340&id2=1&eID=3&entityID=|accessdate=7 April 2014|date=31 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1957-62, the Melbourne Greyhound Racing Association used Arden St to hold its Greyhound meetings. The dogs ran on a track that formed a perimeter around the oval. Races were held on Monday nights and regularly attracted crowds of 5000, with double that number in attendance on the night when Rookie Rebel won the first Australian Cup in 1958. The Arden Street days are described as being the best in the history of Melbourne greyhound racing. Melbourne Greyhound Racing Association shifted its meetings to Olympic Park in 1962 after the Arden Street's ground committee sought to cash in on the popularity of the dogs by doubling the rent.<ref name=\"theage.com.au\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themeadows.org.au/aboutUs_history.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527062653/http://themeadows.org.au/aboutUs_history.php |archivedate=27 May 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nIn the winter of 1965, after North Melbourne had moved to Coburg, Arden Street Oval was rented by the VFL \u2013 in large part to prevent other football codes from renting it.

The upgraded facilities will also serve the community with a Gymnasium, Basketball Courts and Change rooms. The new administration of James Brayshaw worked with various Government agencies including the Melbourne City Council, Victorian State Government, and the Commonwealth Government to have the new facilities increased in size and value from the original $10 million, to a final plan costing $16 million, and providing the NMFC and local community with some of the best amenities of any club in the AFL.\n\nThe new development was opened in time for the 2010 season. The development includes offices for the football department and administration of the NMFC as well as training facilities. As housed in the building is a fencing centre, community gym, basketball court and 'The Huddle' which is a community learning centre.\n\nIn 2013 Arden Street was touted as a possible location for the proposed new 'boutique Stadium' in Melbourne. Other possible sites included [[Punt Road Oval]], home of the [[Richmond Football Club]].\n\nIn 2016, the [[North Melbourne Football Club]] announced they would be playing a game against [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] at Arden Street Oval as part of the 2017 pre-season competition.<ref>{{cite web|title=More Arden St footy?|url=http://www.nmfc.com.au/news/2016-12-08/more-arden-st-footy|publisher=North Melbourne Football Club|accessdate=24 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Edmund|first1=Sam|title=AFL pre-season fixture 2017: Who will your team play in the lead up to Round 1?|url=http://www.news.com.au/sport/afl/afl-preseason-fixture-2017-who-will-your-team-play-in-the-lead-up-to-round-1/news-story/2a73a7a4d996e19a47310a30e982b53b|website=news.com.au|accessdate=24 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Talent|first1=Justin|title=2017 AFL PRE-SEASON GAMES REVEALED|url=https://www.sen.com.au/news/2016/12/07/2017-afl-pre-season-games-revealed/|publisher=SEN|accessdate=24 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Pre-season fixture announced|url=http://www.hawthornfc.com.au/news/2016-12-07/preseason-fixture-announced|publisher=Hawthorn Football Club|accessdate=24 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*{{Austadiums|6}}\n*[http://afltables.com/afl/crowds/vn_arden_st.html VFL/AFL Attendance Records]\n*[http://afltables.com/afl/venues/arden_st.html Team Scoring Records]\n*[http://www.aroundthegrounds.bellestorie.com/arden/arden.html \"Around the Grounds\" - Web Documentary - Arden Street]\n\n{{North Melbourne Football Club}}\n{{AFL grounds}}\n{{MelbourneRacing}}\n\n[[Category:Defunct Australian Football League grounds]]\n[[Category:North Melbourne Football Club]]\n[[Category:Sports venues in Melbourne]]\n[[Category:Defunct greyhound racing venues in Australia]]\n[[Category:Defunct cricket grounds in Australia]]\n", "name_user": "112.141.180.7", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eHistory)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arden_Street_Oval"}

In some countries, a habilitation degree is a required formal qualification to independently teach and examine a designated subject at the university level.\n\n==History and etymology==\nThe term '''habilitation''' is derived from the [[Medieval Latin]] {{lang|la|habilitare}}, meaning \"to make suitable, to fit\", from [[Classical Latin]] {{wikt-lang|la|habilis}} \"fit, proper, skillful\". The degree developed in Germany in the seventeenth century ({{circa|1652}}).<ref>Arguably one of the earliest German habilitation holders is [[Erhard Weigel]] (Dr. phil. hab., Leipzig, 1652, according to the [http://erhard-weigel-gesellschaft.de.dedi2970.your-server.de/biographie-weigels/ Erhard Weigel Gesselschaft] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114124147/http://erhard-weigel-gesellschaft.de.dedi2970.your-server.de/biographie-weigels/ |date=14 November 2016 }}).</ref> Initially, habilitation was synonymous with '''doctoral qualification'''. The term became synonymous with '''post-doctoral qualification''' in Germany in the 19th century \"when holding a doctorate seemed no longer sufficient to guarantee a proficient transfer of knowledge to the next generation\".<ref>Christian Fleck, ''Sociology in Austria'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2015.</ref> Afterwards, it became normal in the German university system to write two doctoral theses: the inaugural thesis ({{lang|de|Inauguraldissertation}}), completing a course of study; and the habilitation thesis ({{lang|de|[[Habilitationsschrift]]}}), which opens the road to a professorship.<ref>Carl Brockelmann, ''History of the Arabic Written Tradition'', Volume 1, BRILL, 2016, p. vii.</ref>\n\n==Prevalence==\nHabilitation qualifications exist in:\n*Belgium (French-speaking part: ''Agr\u00e9gation de l'enseignement sup\u00e9rieur'', until 2010) \n*Brazil ([[:pt:Livre-doc\u00eancia|livre-doc\u00eancia]])\n*France (''Habilitation \u00e0 diriger des recherches'', \"accreditation to supervise research\", abbreviated HDR)\n*Switzerland (Priv.-Doz. and/or Dr. habil.)\n*Germany (Priv.-Doz. and/or Dr. habil.)\n*Poland (dr hab., doktor habilitowany)\n*Austria (formerly Univ.-Doz., now Priv.-Doz.)\n*Egypt (\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0629 \u0100limiyya/Al-Azhar)\n*Denmark (dr. med./scient./phil.)\n*Italy (Abilitazione scientifica nazionale, since 2012)\n*Bulgaria (Docent)\n*Portugal (Agrega\u00e7\u00e3o)\n*Romania (abilitare)\n*Czechia (doc., docent)\n*Finland (Dosentti/Docent)\n*Slovakia (Docent)\n*Sweden (Docent)\n*Hungary, Latvia (Dr. habil.)\n*Slovenia, \n*Greece (\u03c5\u03c6\u03b7\u03b3\u03b5\u03c3\u03af\u03b1, \u03c5\u03c6\u03b7\u03b3\u03b7\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2), abolished in 1983\n*Armenia, Azerbaijan, Lithuania (Habil. dr.; currently abolished and no longer conferred, but those who have earned the degree earlier will use it for life)\n*Moldova, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia ([[Doktor nauk]]){{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nA similar concept known as [[:pt:Livre-doc\u00eancia|livre-doc\u00eancia]] exists in some private universities in Brazil, and in the three state universities of the [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|state of S\u00e3o Paulo]], where it is a pre-requisite of full professorship.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}, as well as at the Federal University of S\u00e3o Paulo (UNIFESP).\n\n==Process==\nA habilitation thesis can be either '''cumulative''' (based on previous research, be it articles or monographs) or '''monographical''', i.e., a specific, unpublished thesis, which then tends to be very long. While cumulative habilitations are predominant in some fields (such as [[medicine]]), they have been, since about a century ago, almost unheard of in others (such as [[law]]).\n\nThe level of scholarship of a habilitation is considerably higher than for a doctoral dissertation in the same academic tradition in terms of quality and quantity, and must be accomplished independently, without direction or guidance of a faculty supervisor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/imperia/md/content/chemie/ordnungenplaene/habil/habilordnung.pdf|format=PDF|title=Habilitationsordnung (Laws and regulations of the Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum, Germany)|language=German|publisher=ruhr-uni-bochum.de|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091014190030/http://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/imperia/md/content/chemie/ordnungenplaene/habil/habilordnung.pdf|archivedate=14 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/stud/prom-habil/index.html|title=PhD and Postdoc|work=fu-berlin.de}}</ref> In the [[science]]s, publication of numerous (sometimes ten or more)<ref>{{cite web|title=A guide to documentation on habilitation and professorship procedures at the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University in Brno|url=http://www.med.muni.cz/dokumenty/html/guide_habilitation_and_prof_procedures.html|publisher=Masaryk University in Brno|accessdate=17 April 2013}}</ref> research articles is required during the habilitation period of about four to ten years. In the [[humanities]], a major book publication may be a prerequisite for defense.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nIt is possible to get a professorship without habilitation, if the search committee attests the candidate to have qualifications equaling those of a habilitation and the higher ranking bodies (the university's [[senate]] and the country's ministry of education) approve of that. However, while some subjects make liberal use of this (e.g., the natural sciences in order to employ candidates from countries with different systems and the arts to employ active artists), in other subjects it is rarely done.\n\nThe habilitation is awarded after a public lecture, to be held after the thesis has been accepted, and after which the '''''venia legendi''''' (Latin: \"permission to read\", i.e., to lecture) is bestowed. In some areas, such as law, philosophy, theology and sociology, the ''venia'', and thus the habilitation, is only given for certain sub-fields (such as [[criminal law]], [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]], or [[philosophy of science]], [[practical philosophy]] etc.); in others, for the entire field.\n\nAlthough disciplines and countries vary in the typical number of years for obtaining habilitation after getting a doctorate, it usually takes longer than for the American [[academic tenure]]. For example, in Poland, the statutory time for getting a habilitation (traditionally, although not obligatorily, relying on a book publication) is eight years. Theoretically, if an assistant professor does not succeed in obtaining habilitation in this time, he should be moved to a position of a lecturer, with a much higher teaching load and no research obligations, or even be dismissed. In practice, however, on many occasions schools extend the deadlines for habilitation for most scholars if they do not make it in time, and there is evidence that they are able to finish it in a near future.\n\n=== Brazil ===\n''Livre-doc\u00eancia'' is a title (similar to '''''Habilitation''''' in Germany) granted to holders of doctorate degrees upon submission of a cumulative thesis followed by a [[Oral exam|''viva voce'' examination]]. It has practically disappeared amongst Brazilian Federal [[Higher education|HEIs]], but it is still required at a few institutions (notably in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo) for admissions as a [[Professor]] (Professor Titular).\n\n===France<!--'Docteur d'\u00c9tat', 'Doctorat d'\u00c9tat', 'State doctor', 'State doctorate', 'Habilitation \u00e0 Diriger des Recherches' and 'Habilitation \u00e0 diriger des recherches' redirect here-->===\n{{see also|Doctorate#France|Agr\u00e9gation#In higher education}}\nThe degree of '''''Docteur d'\u00c9tat'''''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> (State Doctor; abbreviated ''DrE'') or '''''Doctorat d'\u00c9tat'''''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> (State Doctorate), called ''[[Doctorat \u00e8s lettres]]'' (Doctor of Letters) before the 1950s,<ref name=\"Schrift p. 208\">Alan D.

This requirement does not apply to the members of Directeur de Recherche corps who are assimilated to Professeur by the French Conseil National des Universit\u00e9s (CNU).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000267752|title=Arr\u00eat\u00e9 du 7 ao\u00fbt 2006 relatif \u00e0 la formation doctorale. - Legifrance|work=legifrance.gouv.fr}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000520453|title=D\u00e9cret n\u00b084-431 du 6 juin 1984 fixant les dispositions statutaires communes applicables aux enseignants-chercheurs et portant statut particulier du corps des professeurs des universit\u00e9s et du corps des ma\u00eetres de conf\u00e9rences. - Legifrance|work=legifrance.gouv.fr}}</ref> Depending on the field, the French Habilitation requires consistent research from 3 to 10 years after appointment as an Associate Professor (Ma\u00eetre de Conf\u00e9rences), a substantial amount of significant publications, the supervision of at least one PhD student from start to graduation, and a successful track record securing extramural funding as a principal investigator. Exceptional postdoctoral researchers who are not yet appointed to a university could also obtain the Habilitation if they meet the other requirements (although this is exceptional). The Habilitation committee is constituted by a majority of external and sometimes foreign referees. The French Habilitation entitles Associate Professors (Ma\u00eetres de Conf\u00e9rences) to apply for Full Professor positions (Professeur des Universit\u00e9s).\n\n===Germany<!--'Habilitationsschrift' redirects here-->===\n{{see also|Doctorate#Germany|#History and etymology}}\nIn order to hold the rank of Full Professor within the German system, it is necessary to have attained the habilitation or \"habilitation-equivalent achievements\" that can be demonstrated by leading a research group, being a [[junior professor]], or other achievements in research and teaching. The habilitation is thus a qualification at a higher level than the German [[Doctorate|doctoral degree]] awarded during ''[[promotion (academic)|Promotion]]''. It is usually earned after several years of independent research, either \"internally\" while working at a university in a position as a ''{{lang|de|Wissenschaftlicher Assistent}}'' (\"scientific assistant\", a position equivalent to assistant professor when filled by a doctorate-holder) or ''{{lang|de|Akademischer Rat}}'' (lecturer) or \"externally\" as a practitioner such as high school teacher, lawyer, etc.\n\nOnly those candidates receiving the highest or second-highest grade for their doctoral thesis are encouraged to proceed to the habilitation. Since 2006, in some federal states of Germany, there have been new restrictions by the federal laws regarding the degree of the doctoral thesis which allow only excellent candidates to enter the process of ''Habilitation''.\n\nOnce the habilitation thesis ('''''Habilitationsschrift''''', often simply '''''Habilitation''''')<!--italics per MOS:Ety; boldface per WP:R#PLA--> and all other requirements are completed, the candidate (called ''Habilitand'' in German) \"has habilitated himself\" and receives the degree ''Dr. habil.'' (with the specification, such as ''Dr. rer. nat. habil.''). It depends on the state or on the university whether the habilitation counts ''de jure'' as an additional doctorate separate from the original one (in which case he would be a ''Dr. rer. nat. Dr. rer. nat. habil.'').\n\nA distinct procedure, but a formality after completing the habilitation, is officially receiving the ''venia legendi'', Latin for \"permission for lecturing\", or the ''ius docendi'', \"right of teaching\" a specific academic subject at universities for a lifetime. Someone in possession of the ''venia legendi'' but not any [[professorship]] is called a ''[[Privatdozent]]'' (for men) or ''Privatdozentin'' (for women), abbreviated ''PD'' or ''Priv.-Doz.''. The status as a Privatdozent requires doing some (generally unpaid) teaching even in order to keep up the title (''Titellehre'' or titular teaching).\n\nNote that the distinction ''Dr. habil.'' is almost never used together with ''Privatdozent'', as it is implied therein, and only rarely with ''Professor'', in which it used to be implied.\n\n===Austria===\nIn Austria the procedure is currently regulated by national law (Austrian University Act UG2002 \u00a7103<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&Gesetzesnummer=20002128|title=Bundesrecht konsolidiert: Gesamte Rechtsvorschrift f\u00fcr Universit\u00e4tsgesetz 2002, Fassung vom 08.06.2019|work=bka.gv.at}}</ref>). The graduation process includes additionally to the sub-commission of the senate (including students representatives for a hearing on the teaching capabilities of the candidate) an external reviewer. Holding a Habilitation allows academics to do research and supervise (PhD, MSc, ...) on behalf of this university. As it is an academic degree, this is even valid if the person is not enrolled (or not enrolled anymore) at this institution (''Habilitation ad personam''). Appointment to a full professorship with an international finding commission includes a ''[[venia docendi]]'' (UG2002 \u00a798(12)), which is restricted to the time of the appointment (UG2002 \u00a798(13) \u2013 ''Habilitation ad positionem'').\n\nWhile the Habilitation ensures the rights of the independent research and the supervision, it is on behalf of the statute of the universities to give those rights also to, e.g., associate professors without Habilitation. Currently the major Austrian universities do that only for master's level students, but not for PhD programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://satzung.univie.ac.at/studienrecht/|title=Satzung der Universit\u00e4t Wien \u00bb Studienrecht|work=univie.ac.at}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uni-graz.at/zvwww/gesetze/satzung-ug02-06.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606222105/http://www.uni-graz.at/zvwww/gesetze/satzung-ug02-06.pdf |archivedate=6 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uibk.ac.at/fakultaeten-servicestelle/pruefungsreferate/recht.html.en|title=Legal basis|work=Universit\u00e4t Innsbruck|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606224731/http://www.uibk.ac.at/fakultaeten-servicestelle/pruefungsreferate/recht.html.en|archivedate=6 June 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Italy===\nIn the Italian legal system, \"habilitations\" are different types of acts and authorizations.\n\n'''Habilitations for associate and full professorships in Universities'''\n\nRegarding university habilitations, the so-called \"Gelmini Reform\" of the research and university teaching system (Italian Law 240 of year 2010 and subsequent modifications) has established the '''national scientific habilitation''' for the calls in the role of associate professor and full professor (called \"''abilitazione scientifica nazionale''\", or '''ASN'''). \nThis means that, as a prerequisite for being able to be selected by a university committee to fill these roles, it is necessary to have obtained the scientific qualification for the relative kind of teaching.\nFor STEM fields (so called \"bibliometric fields\"), the qualifications requires a two-steps evaluation:\n\n(1) first a '''quantitative''' assessment, as each candidate for and ASN as associate or full professor must have at least 2 out of these 3 requirements: having published more papers than most associate or full professors in Italian universities, having received more citations than most associate or full professors in Italian universities, having an h-index higher than most associate or full professors in Italian universities;\n\n(2) then, a specific committee (one for each scientific sub-field) will '''qualitatively''' evaluate the scientific CV of the candidates, considering funding, mobility, autonomy of the research, awards won, and so on.\n\nThe successful candidate will then receive his or her ASN habilitation as associate or full professor (or, in some instances, for both) and may thus apply for those vacancies in Italian universities.\n\nThe ASN habilitation also allows to compete for 3-years tenure-track assistant professorship positions (called RTDb in the Italian system, as for \"''ricercatore a tempo determinato di tipo b''\"). \nAt the end of the 3-years contract the assistant professor must have a valid ASN habilitation in order to become a permanent associate professor, otherwise he or she is permanently laid off.\nTo prevent this (which may be disastrous to already undermanned Italian departments), it is common practice to award RTDb positions to people ''already'' habilitated as associate or full professors, which is in ''practical'' contrast with the ''spirit'' of the \"Gelmini-reform\".\n\nThe ASN habilitation is valid for 6 years, but a candidate can apply again to renew his or her habilitation 4 years after having received it.\nIf an ASN habilitation application fails, the candidate can apply again, but only after a 12 months hiatus.\n\nDue to extreme scarcity of tenure track positions in Italy, the ASN habilitation validity has been recently increased to 9 years through a government's decree in October 2019.\n\n'''Professional qualifications'''\n\nIn the field of free regulated professions, protected by a professional body (architects, lawyers, engineers, doctors, pharmacists, journalists ...), it identifies the state examination, more properly called \"state examination for the qualification for the exercise of professions\" that allows the already graduated students or the ones having the necessary titles to register in the list of professionals and work. Many state exams include the possession of a specific qualification among the requirements. For example, to participate in the exam for the habilitation for the profession for an architect or an engineer, you must have already graduated from a university. However, in order to actually practice the profession it is necessary to register with the relevant professional association and, if the profession is exercised independently, it is necessary to have a VAT number. These exams are usually organized by the professional orders with the collaboration of the universities in the area.\n\nIn other cases, especially in the case of the health professions or of the childcare professional, not protected by a professional nature, the degree itself is a qualifying title.\n\nFinally, some habilitations, since their activities can't be done autonomously, need to be hired in a suitable structure in order to effectively carry out the profession in question. This is for example the case of the education sector: once the qualifying examination has been passed, a public competition must be won for recruitment in an upper or lower secondary school.\n\n===Portugal===\nIn the Portuguese legal system, there are two types of habilitation degree. The first is normally given to university professors and is named '''''agrega\u00e7\u00e3o''''' <ref>https://dre.pt/application/conteudo/639289</ref>[https://dre.pt/application/conteudo/639289 Decrew of Law 239/2007] while the second is named '''''habilita\u00e7\u00e3o''''' and is more used by doctoral researchers working in institutes outside universities<ref>https://dre.pt/application/conteudo/534996</ref> [https://dre.pt/application/conteudo/534996 Decrew of Law 124/99]. Legally they are equivalent and are required for a professor (agrega\u00e7\u00e3o) or a researcher (habilita\u00e7\u00e3o) to reach the top of their specific careers (Full Professor or Coordinator Researcher). Both degree aims to evaluate if the candidate has achieved significant outputs in terms of scientific activity, including also activities in postgraduation supervision.\n\nThe process to obtain any of the degrees is very similar, with minor changes. Any PhD holder can submit an habilitation thesis to obtain the degree. For ''Agrega\u00e7\u00e3o'', the thesis is composed by a detailed CV of the achievements obtained after concluding the PhD; an detailed report of an academic course taught at the university (or a proposed course to be taught); and the summary of a lesson to be given. For ''Habilita\u00e7\u00e3o'', the academic course report is replaced by a research proposal or a proposal for advanced PhD studies.\n\nAfter the candidate submits the habilitation thesis, a jury composed from 5 to 9 Full Professors or Coordinator Researchers, first evaluates the submitted documents and the majority needs to approve the request by the candidate. If approved, the candidate then needs to defend his thesis in a 2-day public defense. During each day, the public defense has a duration of 2 hours. On the first day, the curriculum of the candidate is discussed (for both degrees) and in the case of \"agrega\u00e7\u00e3o\", the candidate also needs to present the academic course selected. In the second day, the candidate needs to present a lecture (agrega\u00e7\u00e3o) or a proposal of a research project (habilita\u00e7\u00e3o).\n\nFor ''Agrega\u00e7\u00e3o'', the first day of the public defense is the thesis is composed by a detailed CV of the achievements obtained after concluding the PhD; an detailed report of an academic course taught at the university (or a proposed course to be taught); and the summary of a lesson to be given. For ''Habilita\u00e7\u00e3o'', the academic course report is replaced by a research proposal or a proposal for advanced PhD studies.\n\n==Equivalent degrees==\nThe [[Doktor nauk|Doctor of Science]] in Russia and some other countries formerly part of the Soviet Union or the Eastern bloc is equivalent to a Habilitation. The cumulative form of the habilitation can be compared to the [[higher doctorate]]s, such as the D.Sc. ([[Doctor of Science]]), Litt.D. (Doctor of Letters), LL.D. (Doctor of Laws) and D.D. (Doctor of Divinity) found in the UK, Ireland, and some Commonwealth countries, which are awarded on the basis of a career of published work. However, higher doctorates from these countries are often not recognized by any [[German state]] as being equivalent to the habilitation.<ref name=\"anabin\">{{cite web |title=Anabin database |date=24 July 2009 |work=Anabin database (in German, click on \"Abschlusstypen\", then select L\u00e4nderauswahl \"Gro\u00dfbritannien\", then \"Doctor of/in\") |url=https://anabin.kmk.org/no_cache/filter/hochschulabschluesse.html|accessdate=13 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the position or title of an Associate Professor (or higher) at a European Union-based university is systematically translated into or compared to titles such as ''Universit\u00e4tsprofessor (W2)'' (Germany), ''f\u00f8rsteamanuensis'' (Norway), or ''Doktor hab.'' (Poland) by institutions such as the ''[[European Commission]] Directorate-General for Research'',<ref>[https://ec.europa.eu/research/science-society/document_library/pdf_06/she_figures_2009_en.pdf  European Commission Directorate-General for Research on Seniority Grades of Academic Staff, p. 129 and pp. 133ff] accessed September 26, 2017.</ref> and therefore usually implies the holder of such title has a degree equivalent to habilitation.\n\n==Debate==\n\n===German debate about the habilitation===\nIn 2004, the habilitation was the subject of a major political debate in Germany. The former Federal Minister for Education and Science, [[Edelgard Bulmahn]], aimed to abolish the system of the habilitation and replace it by the alternative concept of the junior professor: a researcher should first be employed for up to six years as a \"junior professor\" (a non-[[tenure]]d position roughly equivalent to [[assistant professor]] in the United States) and so prove his/her suitability for holding a tenured professorship.\n\nMany, especially researchers in the [[natural science]]s, as well as young researchers, have long demanded the abandonment of the habilitation as they think it to be an unnecessary and time-consuming obstacle in an academic career, contributing to the [[brain drain]] of talented young researchers who think their chances of getting a professorship at a reasonable age to be better abroad and hence move, for example, to the UK or USA. Many feel overly dependent on their supervising Principal Investigators (the professor heading the research group) as superiors have the power to delay the process of completing the habilitation. A further problem comes with funding support for those who wish to pursue a habilitation where older candidates often feel discriminated against, for example under the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|DFG]]'s Emmy-Noether programme. Furthermore, internal \"soft\" money might be only  budgeted to pay for younger postdoctoral scientists. Because of the need to chase short-term research contracts, many researchers in the natural sciences apply for more transparent career development opportunities in other countries. In summary, a peer-reviewed demonstration of a successful academic development and international out-look is considered more than compensation for an habilitation  where there is evidence of grant applications, well-cited publications, a network of collaborators, lecturing and organisational experience, and experience of having worked and published abroad.\n\nOn the other hand, amongst many senior researchers, especially in [[medicine]], the [[humanities]] and the [[social science]]s, the habilitation was\u2014and still is\u2014regarded as a valuable instrument of quality control (''venia legendi'') before giving somebody a tenured position for life.\n\nBavaria, Saxony and Thuringia, three [[States of Germany|states]] with conservative governments, filed suit at the [[German Constitutional Court]] against the new law replacing the habilitation with the junior professor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wdr.de/themen/forschung/bildung/juniorprofessur/|title=WDR - Informationen und Nachrichten vom Westdeutschen Rundfunk|last=|first=|date=2016-02-27|website=www.wdr.de|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-12}}</ref> The Court concurred with their argument that the [[Bundestag]] (the federal parliament) cannot pass such a law, because the [[German constitution]] explicitly states that affairs of education are the sole responsibility of the states and declared the law to be invalid in June 2004. In reaction, a new federal law was passed, giving the states more freedom regarding habilitations and junior professors. The junior professor has since been legally established in all states, but it is still possible\u2014and encouraged\u2014for an academic career in many subjects in Germany to pursue a habilitation.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [http://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/stud/prom-habil/index.html A short description of PhD and Habilitation at the Free University of Berlin, Germany]\n* [http://www.euroeducation.net/prof/ausco.htm Education in Austria at the European Education Directory]\n* [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/285/5433/1525?ck=nck ''Germany tries to break its Habilitation Habit'' article in the science magazin of the AAAS]\n* [http://portal.mytum.de/archiv/kompendium_rechtsangelegenheiten/habilitationsordnung/engl.Vers._HabilO_mit_AES_13.12.05.pdf Habilitation procedure at the Technical University of Munich, Germany]\n* [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-261281/Hungary Higher Education in Hungary at the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]\n* [http://www.cnatdcu.ro/metodologie/abilitare/ Habilitation in Romania]\n\n{{Academic degrees}}\n\n\n[[Category:Academic degrees]]\n[[Category:Higher doctorates]]\n", "text_old": "{{see also|Postdoctoral research}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n'''Habilitation''' defines the qualification to conduct self-contained university teaching and is the key for access to a professorship in many European countries.

While cumulative habilitations are predominant in some fields (such as [[medicine]]), they have been, since about a century ago, almost unheard of in others (such as [[law]]).\n\nThe level of scholarship of a habilitation is considerably higher than for a doctoral dissertation in the same academic tradition in terms of quality and quantity, and must be accomplished independently, without direction or guidance of a faculty supervisor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/imperia/md/content/chemie/ordnungenplaene/habil/habilordnung.pdf|format=PDF|title=Habilitationsordnung (Laws and regulations of the Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum, Germany)|language=German|publisher=ruhr-uni-bochum.de|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091014190030/http://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/imperia/md/content/chemie/ordnungenplaene/habil/habilordnung.pdf|archivedate=14 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/stud/prom-habil/index.html|title=PhD and Postdoc|work=fu-berlin.de}}</ref> In the [[science]]s, publication of numerous (sometimes ten or more)<ref>{{cite web|title=A guide to documentation on habilitation and professorship procedures at the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University in Brno|url=http://www.med.muni.cz/dokumenty/html/guide_habilitation_and_prof_procedures.html|publisher=Masaryk University in Brno|accessdate=17 April 2013}}</ref> research articles is required during the habilitation period of about four to ten years.

However, while some subjects make liberal use of this (e.g., the natural sciences in order to employ candidates from countries with different systems and the arts to employ active artists), in other subjects it is rarely done.\n\nThe habilitation is awarded after a public lecture, to be held after the thesis has been accepted, and after which the '''''venia legendi''''' (Latin: \"permission to read\", i.e., to lecture) is bestowed. In some areas, such as law, philosophy, theology and sociology, the ''venia'', and thus the habilitation, is only given for certain sub-fields (such as [[criminal law]], [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]], or [[philosophy of science]], [[practical philosophy]] etc.); in others, for the entire field.\n\nAlthough disciplines and countries vary in the typical number of years for obtaining habilitation after getting a doctorate, it usually takes longer than for the American [[academic tenure]]. For example, in Poland, the statutory time for getting a habilitation (traditionally, although not obligatorily, relying on a book publication) is eight years. Theoretically, if an assistant professor does not succeed in obtaining habilitation in this time, he should be moved to a position of a lecturer, with a much higher teaching load and no research obligations, or even be dismissed. In practice, however, on many occasions schools extend the deadlines for habilitation for most scholars if they do not make it in time, and there is evidence that they are able to finish it in a near future.\n\n=== Brazil ===\n''Livre-doc\u00eancia'' is a title (similar to '''''Habilitation''''' in Germany) granted to holders of doctorate degrees upon submission of a cumulative thesis followed by a [[Oral exam|''viva voce'' examination]].

This requirement does not apply to the members of Directeur de Recherche corps who are assimilated to Professeur by the French Conseil National des Universit\u00e9s (CNU).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000267752|title=Arr\u00eat\u00e9 du 7 ao\u00fbt 2006 relatif \u00e0 la formation doctorale. - Legifrance|work=legifrance.gouv.fr}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000520453|title=D\u00e9cret n\u00b084-431 du 6 juin 1984 fixant les dispositions statutaires communes applicables aux enseignants-chercheurs et portant statut particulier du corps des professeurs des universit\u00e9s et du corps des ma\u00eetres de conf\u00e9rences. - Legifrance|work=legifrance.gouv.fr}}</ref> Depending on the field, the French Habilitation requires consistent research from 3 to 10 years after appointment as an Associate Professor (Ma\u00eetre de Conf\u00e9rences), a substantial amount of significant publications, the supervision of at least one PhD student from start to graduation, and a successful track record securing extramural funding as a principal investigator. Exceptional postdoctoral researchers who are not yet appointed to a university could also obtain the Habilitation if they meet the other requirements (although this is exceptional). The Habilitation committee is constituted by a majority of external and sometimes foreign referees. The French Habilitation entitles Associate Professors (Ma\u00eetres de Conf\u00e9rences) to apply for Full Professor positions (Professeur des Universit\u00e9s).\n\n===Germany<!--'Habilitationsschrift' redirects here-->===\n{{see also|Doctorate#Germany|#History and etymology}}\nIn order to hold the rank of Full Professor within the German system, it is necessary to have attained the habilitation or \"habilitation-equivalent achievements\" that can be demonstrated by leading a research group, being a [[junior professor]], or other achievements in research and teaching. The habilitation is thus a qualification at a higher level than the German [[Doctorate|doctoral degree]] awarded during ''[[promotion (academic)|Promotion]]''. It is usually earned after several years of independent research, either \"internally\" while working at a university in a position as a ''{{lang|de|Wissenschaftlicher Assistent}}'' (\"scientific assistant\", a position equivalent to assistant professor when filled by a doctorate-holder) or ''{{lang|de|Akademischer Rat}}'' (lecturer) or \"externally\" as a practitioner such as high school teacher, lawyer, etc.\n\nOnly those candidates receiving the highest or second-highest grade for their doctoral thesis are encouraged to proceed to the habilitation. Since 2006, in some federal states of Germany, there have been new restrictions by the federal laws regarding the degree of the doctoral thesis which allow only excellent candidates to enter the process of ''Habilitation''.\n\nOnce the habilitation thesis ('''''Habilitationsschrift''''', often simply '''''Habilitation''''')<!--italics per MOS:Ety; boldface per WP:R#PLA--> and all other requirements are completed, the candidate (called ''Habilitand'' in German) \"has habilitated himself\" and receives the degree ''Dr. habil.'' (with the specification, such as ''Dr. rer. nat. habil.''). It depends on the state or on the university whether the habilitation counts ''de jure'' as an additional doctorate separate from the original one (in which case he would be a ''Dr. rer. nat. Dr. rer. nat. habil.'').\n\nA distinct procedure, but a formality after completing the habilitation, is officially receiving the ''venia legendi'', Latin for \"permission for lecturing\", or the ''ius docendi'', \"right of teaching\" a specific academic subject at universities for a lifetime. Someone in possession of the ''venia legendi'' but not any [[professorship]] is called a ''[[Privatdozent]]'' (for men) or ''Privatdozentin'' (for women), abbreviated ''PD'' or ''Priv.-Doz.''. The status as a Privatdozent requires doing some (generally unpaid) teaching even in order to keep up the title (''Titellehre'' or titular teaching).\n\nNote that the distinction ''Dr. habil.'' is almost never used together with ''Privatdozent'', as it is implied therein, and only rarely with ''Professor'', in which it used to be implied.\n\n===Austria===\nIn Austria the procedure is currently regulated by national law (Austrian University Act UG2002 \u00a7103<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&Gesetzesnummer=20002128|title=Bundesrecht konsolidiert: Gesamte Rechtsvorschrift f\u00fcr Universit\u00e4tsgesetz 2002, Fassung vom 08.06.2019|work=bka.gv.at}}</ref>). The graduation process includes additionally to the sub-commission of the senate (including students representatives for a hearing on the teaching capabilities of the candidate) an external reviewer. Holding a Habilitation allows academics to do research and supervise (PhD, MSc, ...) on behalf of this university. As it is an academic degree, this is even valid if the person is not enrolled (or not enrolled anymore) at this institution (''Habilitation ad personam''). Appointment to a full professorship with an international finding commission includes a ''[[venia docendi]]'' (UG2002 \u00a798(12)), which is restricted to the time of the appointment (UG2002 \u00a798(13) \u2013 ''Habilitation ad positionem'').\n\nWhile the Habilitation ensures the rights of the independent research and the supervision, it is on behalf of the statute of the universities to give those rights also to, e.g., associate professors without Habilitation. Currently the major Austrian universities do that only for master's level students, but not for PhD programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://satzung.univie.ac.at/studienrecht/|title=Satzung der Universit\u00e4t Wien \u00bb Studienrecht|work=univie.ac.at}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uni-graz.at/zvwww/gesetze/satzung-ug02-06.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606222105/http://www.uni-graz.at/zvwww/gesetze/satzung-ug02-06.pdf |archivedate=6 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uibk.ac.at/fakultaeten-servicestelle/pruefungsreferate/recht.html.en|title=Legal basis|work=Universit\u00e4t Innsbruck|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606224731/http://www.uibk.ac.at/fakultaeten-servicestelle/pruefungsreferate/recht.html.en|archivedate=6 June 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Italy===\nIn the Italian legal system, \"habilitations\" are different types of acts and authorizations.\n\n'''Habilitations for associate and full professorships in Universities'''\n\nRegarding university habilitations, the so-called \"Gelmini Reform\" of the research and university teaching system (Italian Law 240 of year 2010 and subsequent modifications) has established the '''national scientific habilitation''' for the calls in the role of associate professor and full professor (called \"''abilitazione scientifica nazionale''\", or '''ASN'''). \nThis means that, as a prerequisite for being able to be selected by a university committee to fill these roles, it is necessary to have obtained the scientific qualification for the relative kind of teaching.\nFor STEM fields (so called \"bibliometric fields\"), the qualifications requires a two-steps evaluation:\n\n(1) first a '''quantitative''' assessment, as each candidate for and ASN as associate or full professor must have at least 2 out of these 3 requirements: having published more papers than most associate or full professors in Italian universities, having received more citations than most associate or full professors in Italian universities, having an h-index higher than most associate or full professors in Italian universities;\n\n(2) then, a specific committee (one for each scientific sub-field) will '''qualitatively''' evaluate the scientific CV of the candidates, considering funding, mobility, autonomy of the research, awards won, and so on.\n\nThe successful candidate will then receive his or her ASN habilitation as associate or full professor (or, in some instances, for both) and may thus apply for those vacancies in Italian universities.\n\nThe ASN habilitation also allows to compete for 3-years tenure-track assistant professorship positions (called RTDb in the Italian system, as for \"''ricercatore a tempo determinato di tipo b''\"). \nAt the end of the 3-years contract the assistant professor must have a valid ASN habilitation in order to become a permanent associate professor, otherwise he or she is permanently laid off.\nTo prevent this (which may be disastrous to already undermanned Italian departments), it is common practice to award RTDb positions to people ''already'' habilitated as associate or full professors, which is in ''practical'' contrast with the ''spirit'' of the \"Gelmini-reform\".\n\nThe ASN habilitation is valid for 6 years, but a candidate can apply again to renew his or her habilitation 4 years after having received it.\nIf an ASN habilitation application fails, the candidate can apply again, but only after a 12 months hiatus.\n\nDue to extreme scarcity of tenure track positions in Italy, the ASN habilitation validity has been recently increased to 9 years through a government's decree in October 2019.\n\n'''Professional qualifications'''\n\nIn the field of free regulated professions, protected by a professional body (architects, lawyers, engineers, doctors, pharmacists, journalists ...), it identifies the state examination, more properly called \"state examination for the qualification for the exercise of professions\" that allows the already graduated students or the ones having the necessary titles to register in the list of professionals and work. Many state exams include the possession of a specific qualification among the requirements. For example, to participate in the exam for the habilitation for the profession for an architect or an engineer, you must have already graduated from a university. However, in order to actually practice the profession it is necessary to register with the relevant professional association and, if the profession is exercised independently, it is necessary to have a VAT number. These exams are usually organized by the professional orders with the collaboration of the universities in the area.\n\nIn other cases, especially in the case of the health professions or of the childcare professional, not protected by a professional nature, the degree itself is a qualifying title.\n\nFinally, some habilitations, since their activities can't be done autonomously, need to be hired in a suitable structure in order to effectively carry out the profession in question. This is for example the case of the education sector: once the qualifying examination has been passed, a public competition must be won for recruitment in an upper or lower secondary school.\n\n===Portugal===\nIn the Portuguese legal system, there are two types of habilitation degree. The first is normally given to university professors and is named '''''agrega\u00e7\u00e3o''''' <ref>https://dre.pt/application/conteudo/639289</ref>[https://dre.pt/application/conteudo/639289 Decrew of Law 239/2007] while the second is named '''''habilita\u00e7\u00e3o''''' and is more used by doctoral researchers working in institutes outside universities<ref>https://dre.pt/application/conteudo/534996</ref> [https://dre.pt/application/conteudo/534996 Decrew of Law 124/99]. Legally they are equivalent and are required for a professor (agrega\u00e7\u00e3o) or a researcher (habilita\u00e7\u00e3o) to reach the top of their specific careers (Full Professor or Coordinator Researcher). Both degree aims to evaluate if the candidate has achieved significant outputs in terms of scientific activity, including also activities in postgraduation supervision.\n\nThe process to obtain any of the degrees is very similar, with minor changes. Any PhD holder can submit an habilitation thesis to obtain the degree. For ''Agrega\u00e7\u00e3o'', the thesis is composed by a detailed CV of the achievements obtained after concluding the PhD; an detailed report of an academic course taught at the university (or a proposed course to be taught); and the summary of a lesson to be given. For ''Habilita\u00e7\u00e3o'', the academic course report is replaced by a research proposal or a proposal for advanced PhD studies.\n\nAfter the candidate submits the habilitation thesis, a jury composed from 5 to 9 Full Professors or Coordinator Researchers, first evaluates the submitted documents and the majority needs to approve the request by the candidate. If approved, the candidate then needs to defend his thesis in a 2-day public defense. During each day, the public defense has a duration of 2 hours. On the first day, the curriculum of the candidate is discussed (for both degrees) and in the case of \"agrega\u00e7\u00e3o\", the candidate also needs to present the academic course selected. In the second day, the candidate needs to present a lecture (agrega\u00e7\u00e3o) or a proposal of a research project (habilita\u00e7\u00e3o).\n\nFor ''Agrega\u00e7\u00e3o'', the first day of the public defense is the thesis is composed by a detailed CV of the achievements obtained after concluding the PhD; an detailed report of an academic course taught at the university (or a proposed course to be taught); and the summary of a lesson to be given. For ''Habilita\u00e7\u00e3o'', the academic course report is replaced by a research proposal or a proposal for advanced PhD studies.\n\n==Equivalent degrees==\nThe [[Doktor nauk|Doctor of Science]] in Russia and some other countries formerly part of the Soviet Union or the Eastern bloc is equivalent to a Habilitation. The cumulative form of the habilitation can be compared to the [[higher doctorate]]s, such as the D.Sc. ([[Doctor of Science]]), Litt.D. (Doctor of Letters), LL.D. (Doctor of Laws) and D.D. (Doctor of Divinity) found in the UK, Ireland, and some Commonwealth countries, which are awarded on the basis of a career of published work. However, higher doctorates from these countries are often not recognized by any [[German state]] as being equivalent to the habilitation.<ref name=\"anabin\">{{cite web |title=Anabin database |date=24 July 2009 |work=Anabin database (in German, click on \"Abschlusstypen\", then select L\u00e4nderauswahl \"Gro\u00dfbritannien\", then \"Doctor of/in\") |url=https://anabin.kmk.org/no_cache/filter/hochschulabschluesse.html|accessdate=13 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the position or title of an Associate Professor (or higher) at a European Union-based university is systematically translated into or compared to titles such as ''Universit\u00e4tsprofessor (W2)'' (Germany), ''f\u00f8rsteamanuensis'' (Norway), or ''Doktor hab.'' (Poland) by institutions such as the ''[[European Commission]] Directorate-General for Research'',<ref>[https://ec.europa.eu/research/science-society/document_library/pdf_06/she_figures_2009_en.pdf  European Commission Directorate-General for Research on Seniority Grades of Academic Staff, p. 129 and pp. 133ff] accessed September 26, 2017.</ref> and therefore usually implies the holder of such title has a degree equivalent to habilitation.\n\n==Debate==\n\n===German debate about the habilitation===\nIn 2004, the habilitation was the subject of a major political debate in Germany. The former Federal Minister for Education and Science, [[Edelgard Bulmahn]], aimed to abolish the system of the habilitation and replace it by the alternative concept of the junior professor: a researcher should first be employed for up to six years as a \"junior professor\" (a non-[[tenure]]d position roughly equivalent to [[assistant professor]] in the United States) and so prove his/her suitability for holding a tenured professorship.\n\nMany, especially researchers in the [[natural science]]s, as well as young researchers, have long demanded the abandonment of the habilitation as they think it to be an unnecessary and time-consuming obstacle in an academic career, contributing to the [[brain drain]] of talented young researchers who think their chances of getting a professorship at a reasonable age to be better abroad and hence move, for example, to the UK or USA. Many feel overly dependent on their supervising Principal Investigators (the professor heading the research group) as superiors have the power to delay the process of completing the habilitation. A further problem comes with funding support for those who wish to pursue a habilitation where older candidates often feel discriminated against, for example under the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|DFG]]'s Emmy-Noether programme. Furthermore, internal \"soft\" money might be only  budgeted to pay for younger postdoctoral scientists. Because of the need to chase short-term research contracts, many researchers in the natural sciences apply for more transparent career development opportunities in other countries. In summary, a peer-reviewed demonstration of a successful academic development and international out-look is considered more than compensation for an habilitation  where there is evidence of grant applications, well-cited publications, a network of collaborators, lecturing and organisational experience, and experience of having worked and published abroad.\n\nOn the other hand, amongst many senior researchers, especially in [[medicine]], the [[humanities]] and the [[social science]]s, the habilitation was\u2014and still is\u2014regarded as a valuable instrument of quality control (''venia legendi'') before giving somebody a tenured position for life.\n\nBavaria, Saxony and Thuringia, three [[States of Germany|states]] with conservative governments, filed suit at the [[German Constitutional Court]] against the new law replacing the habilitation with the junior professor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wdr.de/themen/forschung/bildung/juniorprofessur/|title=WDR - Informationen und Nachrichten vom Westdeutschen Rundfunk|last=|first=|date=2016-02-27|website=www.wdr.de|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-12}}</ref> The Court concurred with their argument that the [[Bundestag]] (the federal parliament) cannot pass such a law, because the [[German constitution]] explicitly states that affairs of education are the sole responsibility of the states and declared the law to be invalid in June 2004. In reaction, a new federal law was passed, giving the states more freedom regarding habilitations and junior professors. The junior professor has since been legally established in all states, but it is still possible\u2014and encouraged\u2014for an academic career in many subjects in Germany to pursue a habilitation.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [http://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/stud/prom-habil/index.html A short description of PhD and Habilitation at the Free University of Berlin, Germany]\n* [http://www.euroeducation.net/prof/ausco.htm Education in Austria at the European Education Directory]\n* [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/285/5433/1525?ck=nck ''Germany tries to break its Habilitation Habit'' article in the science magazin of the AAAS]\n* [http://portal.mytum.de/archiv/kompendium_rechtsangelegenheiten/habilitationsordnung/engl.Vers._HabilO_mit_AES_13.12.05.pdf Habilitation procedure at the Technical University of Munich, Germany]\n* [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-261281/Hungary Higher Education in Hungary at the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]\n* [http://www.cnatdcu.ro/metodologie/abilitare/ Habilitation in Romania]\n\n{{Academic degrees}}\n\n\n[[Category:Academic degrees]]\n[[Category:Higher doctorates]]\n", "name_user": "172.218.170.146", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(changed \"Czech Republic\" to \"Czechia\" to reflect current naming convention)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habilitation"}

Shaken by the economic crisis of the time, Heinrich saw a way out of his misery in gelatin production. The raw material for this could be purchased cheaply, as it was produced in the large tanneries as residual material. With around 60 employees, the factory was already producing photographic gelatin in 1884, which was an important material for the rapidly emerging photography in the 19th century. In 1887 the Koepff brothers acquired the competing company A. & C. Wolff in [[Heilbronn]]. Both locations had 320 employees who produced 400 tonnes of gelatin per year. In 1901 a major fire destroyed large parts of the factory. The brothers quarreled over reconstruction. Heinrich went to Heilbronn and Paul Koepff continued to run the rebuilt plant alone under the name G\u00f6ppinger Gelatin Factory Paul Koepff. In 1911 he sold the factory to DGF AG,<ref>''[https://www.nutraceuticalsworld.com/issues/2002-06/view_supply-source/supply-source-dgf-stoess-ag-the-gelatin-experts/ DGF Stoess AG: The Gelatine Experts]''. Nutraceuticals World, (German), January 6, 2002.</ref> which already operated gelatin factories in Schweinfurt and H\u00f6chst. Paul Koepff was henceforth on the board of directors and continued to manage his former company as director. In 1929 Paul Koepff jr. took over the management of the [[G\u00f6ppingen]] plant from his father, who died in 1953. The Gelita [[Brand]] was introduced in 1934. After the [[World War II]], Paul Koepff Jr. became managing director of the Stoess company in Eberbach. In 1949 he built up a gelatin capsule factory there. In the course of the decades, DGF AG bought various factories worldwide. In 1965 it was taken over by the \"Chem. Werke Stoess\" in [[Heidelberg]]. In that year Heinrich Koepff took over the majority of shares of the G\u00f6ppingen plant and through his marriage to the granddaughter of the company founder, Gerda Stoess, the companies merged. In 1972, the association traded under the name DGF Stoess & Co. GmbH. In 1989, the company was converted into a public limited company. The gelatin production division was renamed the Gelita Group in 1999.<ref>''Gelita Establishes New Names''.

Gelita was preceded by the founding of the \"Gebr\u00fcder K\u00f6pff Company\",<ref>''[https://www.goeppingen.de/site/Goeppingen-Internet/get/params_E833624684/2934416/1727%20Papierm\u00fchle.pdf Papier aus G\u00f6ppingen]''. Website of the City G\u00f6ppingen, (German), seen February, 2020.</ref> Heinrich Koepff's small [[tannery]], in 1883. Shaken by the economic crisis of the time, Heinrich saw a way out of his misery in gelatin production. The raw material for this could be purchased cheaply, as it was produced in the large tanneries as residual material. With around 60 employees, the factory was already producing photographic gelatin in 1884, which was an important material for the rapidly emerging photography in the 19th century. In 1887 the Koepff brothers acquired the competing company A. & C. Wolff in [[Heilbronn]]. Both locations had 320 employees who produced 400 tonnes of gelatin per year. In 1901 a major fire destroyed large parts of the factory. The brothers quarreled over reconstruction. Heinrich went to Heilbronn and Paul Koepff continued to run the rebuilt plant alone under the name G\u00f6ppinger Gelatin Factory Paul Koepff. In 1911 he sold the factory to DGF AG,<ref>''[https://www.nutraceuticalsworld.com/issues/2002-06/view_supply-source/supply-source-dgf-stoess-ag-the-gelatin-experts/ DGF Stoess AG: The Gelatine Experts]''. Nutraceuticals World, (German), January 6, 2002.</ref> which already operated gelatin factories in Schweinfurt and H\u00f6chst. Paul Koepff was henceforth on the board of directors and continued to manage his former company as director. In 1929 Paul Koepff jr. took over the management of the [[G\u00f6ppingen]] plant from his father, who died in 1953. The Gelita [[Brand]] was introduced in 1934. After the [[World War II]], Paul Koepff jr. became managing director of the Stoess company in Eberbach. In 1949 he built up a gelatin capsule factory there. In the course of the decades, DGF AG bought various factories worldwide. In 1965 it was taken over by the \"Chem. Werke Stoess\" in [[Heidelberg]]. In that year Heinrich Koepff took over the majority of shares of the G\u00f6ppingen plant and through his marriage to the granddaughter of the company founder, Gerda Stoess, the companies merged. In 1972, the association traded under the name DGF Stoess & Co. GmbH. In 1989, the company was converted into a public limited company. The gelatin production division was renamed the Gelita Group in 1999.<ref>''Gelita Establishes New Names''.

Originally a feature of [[Google+]], Hangouts became a stand-alone product in 2013, when Google also began integrating features from Google+ Messenger and [[Google Talk]] into Hangouts. In 2017, Google began developing Hangouts into a product aimed at enterprise communication. Hangouts is now part of the G Suite line of products and consists of two primary products: [[#Google Meet|Google Meet]] and [[#Google Chat|Google Chat]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/hangouts/ras-Y5TGI40|title=Re: Hangouts Classic - Google Product Forms|last=Vaid|first=Paritosh|date=December 3, 2018|website=Google Product Forms|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181203081016/https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/hangouts/ras-Y5TGI40|archive-date=December 3, 2018|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> Google has also begun integrating features of [[Google Voice]], its [[Voice over IP|IP telephony]] product, into Hangouts, stating that Hangouts is designed to be \"the future\" of Voice.

These have included the enterprise-oriented [[Google Talk]] (based on [[XMPP]]), [[Google+]]Messenger, and the Hangouts feature of Google+, which provided chat, voice, videoconferencing features. However, its increasingly fragmented and non-unified suite of messaging offerings was also facing growing competition from services such as [[Facebook Messenger]], [[iMessage]], and [[WhatsApp]]. A decision was made to scrap the existing Google Talk system and code a new messaging product through a collaboration with multiple development teams.<ref name=verge-hangouts>{{cite web|title=Exclusive: Inside Hangouts, Google's big fix for its messaging mess|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/15/4318830/inside-hangouts-googles-big-fix-for-its-messaging-mess|website=The Verge|accessdate=May 17, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003094853/http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/15/4318830/inside-hangouts-googles-big-fix-for-its-messaging-mess|archive-date=October 3, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFollowing reports that the new service would be known as \"Babel\", the service officially launched as Hangouts during the [[Google I/O]] conference on May 15, 2013.<ref name=verge-hangouts/><ref name=engadget-babel>{{cite web|title=Google's rumored Babel chat service will reportedly launch as Hangouts|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/05/10/google-babel-to-become-hangouts-chat-system/|publisher=Engadget|accessdate=May 17, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607183041/http://www.engadget.com/2013/05/10/google-babel-to-become-hangouts-chat-system/|archive-date=June 7, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn February 16, 2015, Google announced it would be discontinuing Google Talk and instructed users to migrate to the Hangouts app on the Chrome browser platform.<ref>{{cite web|title=Google Talk Discontinued;

However, because it uses a proprietary protocol<ref name=verge-hangouts/> instead of the [[XMPP]] [[open standard]] protocol used by Google Talk, most third-party applications which had access to Google Talk do not have access to Google+ Hangouts.\n\nChat histories are saved online, allowing them to be synced between devices.
