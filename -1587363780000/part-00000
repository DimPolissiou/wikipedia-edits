Codwell Auditorium]]\nIn the 1970s Houston ISD had been [[Desegregation in the United States|desegregated]]. As the Fifth Ward as a neighborhood experienced a surge in crime, Houston ISD rezoned the [[Denver Harbor, Houston|Denver Harbor]] neighborhood, which had many White residents, to Wheatley. At that time the neighborhood was quickly becoming Hispanic. Many area Hispanic students preferred to attend [[Austin High School (Houston)|Austin High School]] and [[Furr High School]] as they became the majority population at those schools. John Nova Lomax of the ''[[Houston Press]]'' stated that pride and discipline at Wheatley began to disintegrate in the 1970s, as counselors complained about a low level of morale among the students. The school abolished [[corporal punishment]] around that time, since White parents did not want Black teachers to physically punish white students, and Black parents did not want White teachers to physically punish black students. In addition, many of Wheatley's new White teachers, many of whom did not live in the Fifth Ward, had a lack of experience in teaching inner city Black students. Wylie Henry, a former HISD board member, said that many of the new White teachers \"came in and tried to be kids' friends instead of their teachers.\"<ref name=\"Wrong3\"/> In 1979 Principal Herald stated that integration caused the best students and teachers to leave the school.<ref name=Westp178/>\n\nIn 1976<!--down a point--> the school was in the bottom twelfth [[percentile]] for reading; this meant that 88% of U.S. high school students had better reading scores than Wheatley students<!--The same article stated that the 1977 score means Wheatley did worse than 89% of US HS students-->. In 1977 it declined to the bottom 11th. In 1978 HISD proposed using smaller classes, higher teaching salary, and a redesigned educational program to ameliorate Wheatley's academic problems. In 1979 Herald stated that test scores had declined.<ref name=Westp178/>\n\nThat year Herald also stated that the situation at the school was more peaceful in the 1970s than during the [[Civil Rights Movement]]; he added that 50% of Wheatley students were attempting to gain admission in to university and that some gifted individuals still remained at the school.<ref name=Westp178/>\n\nIn the mid-1980s, as [[crack cocaine]] became an epidemic in many inner-city neighborhoods, Wheatley students and teachers complained about security issues regarding some area apartments. In 1985 three youngsters walked onto the campus and shot an English teacher who had been conducting drill team rehearsals in the cafeteria. In 1986 a Hispanic student who had transferred from [[Dallas]] shot another Hispanic student in the face. After Joan Raymond became superintendent in 1986, she considered closing Wheatley because of difficulties in making the school have acceptable academic achievement and safety. Michael Berryhill of the ''[[Houston Press]]'' said that it was not politically possible to have the school closed since there were too many Wheatley alumni who did not want their school to be closed.<ref name=\"Wrong4\">Berryhill, Michael. \"What's Wrong With Wheatley?.\" ''[[Houston Press]]''.

Codwell Auditorium]]\nIn the 1970s Houston ISD had been [[Desegregation in the United States|desegregated]]. As the Fifth Ward as a neighborhood experienced a surge in crime, Houston ISD rezoned the [[Denver Harbor, Houston|Denver Harbor]] neighborhood, which had many White residents, to Wheatley. At that time the neighborhood was quickly becoming Hispanic. Many area Hispanic students preferred to attend [[Austin High School (Houston)|Austin High School]] and [[Furr High School]] as they became the majority population at those schools. John Nova Lomax of the ''[[Houston Press]]'' stated that pride and discipline at Wheatley began to disintegrate in the 1970s, as counselors complained about a low level of morale among the students. The school abolished [[corporal punishment]] around that time, since White parents did not want Black teachers to physically punish white students, and Black parents did not want White teachers to physically punish black students. In addition, many of Wheatley's new White teachers, many of whom did not live in the Fifth Ward, had a lack of experience in teaching inner city Black students. Wylie Henry, a former HISD board member, said that many of the new White teachers \"came in and tried to be kids' friends instead of their teachers.\"<ref name=\"Wrong3\"/> In 1979 Principal Herald stated that integration caused the best students and teachers to leave the school.<ref name=Westp178/>\n\nIn 1976<!--down a point--> the school was in the bottom twelfth [[percentile]] for reading; this meant that 88% of U.S. high school students had better reading scores than Wheatley students<!--The same article stated that the 1977 score means Wheatley did worse than 89% of US HS students-->. In 1977 it declined to the bottom 11th. In 1978 HISD proposed using smaller classes, higher teaching salary, and a redesigned educational program to ameliorate Wheatley's academic problems. In 1979 Herald stated that test scores had declined.<ref name=Westp178/>\n\nThat year Herald also stated that the situation at the school was more peaceful in the 1970s than during the [[Civil Rights Movement]]; he added that 50% of Wheatley students were attempting to gain admission in to university and that some gifted individuals still remained at the school.<ref name=Westp178/>\n\nIn the mid-1980s, as [[crack cocaine]] became an epidemic in many inner-city neighborhoods, Wheatley students and teachers complained about security issues regarding some area apartments. In 1985 three youngsters walked onto the campus and shot an English teacher who had been conducting drill team rehearsals in the cafeteria. In 1986 a Hispanic student who had transferred from [[Dallas]] shot another Hispanic student in the face. After Joan Raymond became superintendent in 1986, she considered closing Wheatley because of difficulties in making the school have acceptable academic achievement and safety. Michael Berryhill of the ''[[Houston Press]]'' said that it was not politically possible to have the school closed since there were too many Wheatley alumni who did not want their school to be closed.<ref name=\"Wrong4\">Berryhill, Michael. \"What's Wrong With Wheatley?.\" ''[[Houston Press]]''.

It is an alternative to tools such as REdit,<ref>[http://www.mactech.com/articles/mactech/Vol.02/02.05/ResourceEditors/index.html MacTech - All About Resource Editors]</ref> and the resource [[compiler]] ''Rez.'' For the average user, ResEdit is generally easier to use, because it uses a [[graphical user interface]]. Although it had been intended to be a developer tool, [[power user]]s often use it to edit icons, menus, and other elements of an application's [[Graphical user interface|GUI]], customizing it to their own preferences.\n\nResources on the Macintosh can be of many different types, and in fact any arbitrary data can be turned into a resource. While the [[System 7|system]] defines many standard formats for particular kinds of resources (for example, an icon, or a window template), programmers are also free to define their own. ResEdit includes support for editing many of the standard types and for creating arbitrary resources with any structure a programmer saw fit.\n\n[[File:ResEditPatch.png|right|Patch a [[Relisys]] driver to Primax]]\nResEdit is one of the earliest examples of a GUI layout tool, an essential component for [[rapid application development]]. For example, the [[classic Mac OS]] defines a standard resource called a dialog template and a dialog items list (resource types 'DLOG' and 'DITL' respectively). In ResEdit, it's possible to simply create these types and add GUI elements to them in an almost [[WYSIWYG]] fashion, such that a user interface could be designed directly as it would appear to the end user of the application. Later, the application code can create a functional [[dialog box]] using the stored resource data which matches the appearance you lay out in ResEdit. While hardly a revolutionary concept today, when ResEdit first appeared in the mid-1980s, this was a considerable innovation. ResEdit includes standard editors for window templates (<code>WIND</code>), menus (<code>MENU</code>), dialog boxes, controls (<code>CNTL</code>), color palettes (<code>clut</code> and <code>pltt</code>), icons (<code>ICON</code>, <code>cicn</code>, <code>ICN#</code>), and various other standard types.\n\nOne of ResEdit's most powerful features (which first appeared with ResEdit version 2.0) is the ability to define arbitrary data structures as resources using a simple template building feature. Here, the programmer can simply add elemental data types to a list to define a template (itself stored as a resource of type <code>TMPL</code>). This template allows ResEdit to build a GUI editor on the fly that allows entry of data and package it into the structure defined in the template. It's a simple matter for a programmer to define a matching data structure in a chosen programming language, such as C, load the resource in a standard manner and access the data as the defined C type. ResEdit includes a number of predefined templates for many standard OS resources that do not require a graphical editor.\n\nResEdit was never upgraded to run natively on [[macOS|Mac OS X]] (or, indeed, on [[PowerPC]]-based Macintoshes), and Apple now discourages the use of resource forks in new macOS applications, preferring the more portable [[NeXT]]-derived [[application bundle]]s. A long-standing third-party commercial alternative named [[Resorcerer]] remains available, and more recently there have been a number of attempts to build open-source macOS-native resource editors, including one called [[ResKnife]]. ResEdit will run in Mac OS X's [[Classic (Mac OS X)|Classic compatibility mode]], but Classic is neither available on [[Apple\u2013Intel architecture|Intel Macintosh computers]], nor in [[Mac OS X v10.5]] or later. However, an Intel Mac can run ResEdit via an emulator such as [[SheepShaver]] or [[Basilisk II]].\n\nThe last official version of ResEdit is 2.1.3, released in August 1994. Unofficial [[hack (computer science)|hack]]s released as ResEdit 2.1.4 and later exist, adding features such as a [[decompiler]] and the ability to edit [[data fork]]s, but these are unsupported by Apple.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.resexcellence.com/2012/11/29/resedit-reference-and-download/|title=ResEdit Reference and Download|quote=ResEdit 2.1.4 was an unofficial, unreleased version that added some extras...ResEdit 3.0 was a development version for the old Copland OS...SuperResEdit was a version put together by someone other than Apple, that had some additional templates (which are now outdated) and came with a utility called Forker.

This resulting film, created nearly 30 years after its inception, was a critical failure and grossed US$2 million from a US$3.5-million budget. However, it did prove to be extremely successful in Europe and Japan. In addition, the success of the music score was able to cover the budget.\n\nCritics such as Tim Hunter and [[Andrew Sarris]], as well as poet [[John Betjeman]] and director [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]], viewed the film as being among Chaplin's best works. Actor [[Jack Nicholson]] is also a big fan of the film.\n\nThe film's theme song, \"[[This Is My Song (1967 song)|This Is My Song]]\", written by Chaplin and performed by [[Petula Clark]], became a worldwide success, topping the charts in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, the Netherlands and Belgium, while reaching number three in the United States and number four in Canada.\n\n==Plot==\nAmbassador-designate to Saudi Arabia Ogden Mears sails back to America after touring the world. At a layover in Hong Kong, Ogden meets Natascha{{snd}}a Russian countess whose parents died after the family was expelled following the [[Russian Revolution]]{{snd}}who then sneaks into his cabin in evening dress to escape her life as a prostitute at a sailors' dance hall. A refugee, she has no passport, and she is forced to hide in his cabin during the voyage.\n\nOgden dislikes the situation, being a married man although seeking a divorce, and he worries how it might affect his career if she is found. But he reluctantly agrees to let her stay. They must then figure out how to get her off the ship, and it is arranged that she marry Hudson, his middle-aged valet.\n\nAlthough it is only a formality, Hudson wishes to consummate the relationship, a wish she does not share. She avoids him until they dock in Honolulu, then jumps off the ship and swims ashore.\n\nOgden's wife Martha arrives in Honolulu to join the cruise, under advice from Washington that they avoid the impropriety of a divorce. Ogden's lawyer friend Harvey, who helped arrange the marriage, meets Natascha ashore and tells her that the immigration officers have accepted her as Hudson's wife, and she will remain in Honolulu. Martha confronts Ogden about Natascha, speaking rather roughly about her and her past lifestyle as a prostitute and the mistress of a gangster, having learned her past from a passenger who was Natascha's customer in Hong Kong. Ogden responds by asking if his wife would have done as well under such circumstances.\n\nThe ship sets sail for the U.S. mainland, but Ogden surprises Natascha in the hotel's cabaret where they begin dancing as he has left the ship and his wife.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast, order and roles per tombstone closing credits --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Marlon Brando]] as Ogden\n* [[Sophia Loren]] as Natascha\n* [[Sydney Chaplin (American actor)|Sydney Chaplin]] as Harvey\n* [[Tippi Hedren]] as Martha\n* [[Patrick Cargill]] as Hudson\n* [[Michael Medwin]] as John Felix, sailor\n* [[Oliver Johnston (actor)|Oliver Johnston]] as Clark, a director of Mears' oil company\n* [[John Paul (actor)|John Paul]] as The Captain\n* [[Angela Scoular]] as The Society Girl (\"Daddy says...\")\n* [[Margaret Rutherford]] as Miss Gaulswallow\n}}\n\nIn addition, [[Charlie Chaplin]] briefly appears as an Old Steward, while his daughters [[Geraldine Chaplin|Geraldine]], [[Josephine Chaplin|Josephine]] and [[Victoria Chaplin|Victoria]] make brief appearances as Girl at Dance (on the ship) and as Two Young Girls (entering the Waikiki Hotel), respectively.\n\n==Production==\nThis was Chaplin's first film in 10 years, after 1957's ''[[A King in New York]]''.  He had written a draft of the script in the late 1930s under the working title ''The Stowaway'', as a starring vehicle for his then-wife [[Paulette Goddard]].\n\nHe originally wanted [[Rex Harrison]] or [[Cary Grant]] to play the lead but eventually Marlon Brando was cast. Both Brando and Sophia Loren agreed to play their parts without reading a script. Shooting began on 25 January 1966 at [[Pinewood Studios]]; it was frequently interrupted by Brando arriving late and then being hospitalised with appendicitis, Chaplin and Brando having the flu, and Loren remarrying [[Carlo Ponti]].<ref name=\"nat\">Nat Segaloff, ''Final Cuts: The Last Films of 50 Great Directors'', Bear Manor Media 2013 p 60-61</ref>\n\nThis is [[Tippi Hedren]]'s first feature film after her break with director [[Alfred Hitchcock]]. She had high hopes for the film, until she received the script. When she realised that she had a small part as Brando's estranged wife, she asked Chaplin to expand her role. Although Chaplin tried to accommodate her, he could not, as the story mostly takes place on a ship that Hedren's character boards near the end of the film. In the end, she remained in the film and later said that it was a pleasure working for him.\n\nHedren described Chaplin's directorial technique in the following way:  \"Chaplin\u2019s method was to act out all our different roles, which was brilliant to watch. Instead of directing, he\u2019d get out there on set and say: 'OK, do this,' and show us how. He\u2019d become Sophia Loren. He\u2019d become me and Marlon.

Vance believes some of Chaplin's own comic vision and optimism is infused in Sophia Loren's role. A dance-hall girl, Loren's character of Natascha\u2014a prostitute\u2014\"perpetuates Chaplin's lifelong fascination with fallen women as heroines. In many ways, Natascha is the proxy for the Tramp in the film, searching for a better life, while always understanding that both happiness and beauty are fleeting. The Tramp's philosophy is expressed by Natascha's dialogue, 'Don't be sad. That's too easy. Be like me. At this moment, I'm very happy...That's all we can ask for\u2014this moment.' This statement can be applied to the film as well: while it is easy to lament its many failures, particularly because it is Chaplin's last film, it is perhaps best to cherish its wonderful, fleeting comic moments.\"<ref>Vance, Jeffrey.

Vance believes some of Chaplin's own comic vision and optimism is infused in Sophia Loren's role. A dance-hall girl, Loren's character of Natascha\u2014a prostitute\u2014\"perpetuates Chaplin's lifelong fascination with fallen women as heroines. In many ways, Natascha is the proxy for the Tramp in the film, searching for a better life, while always understanding that both happiness and beauty are fleeting. The Tramp's philosophy is expressed by Natascha's dialogue, 'Don't be sad. That's too easy. Be like me. At this moment, I'm very happy...That's all we can ask for\u2014this moment.' This statement can be applied to the film as well: while it is easy to lament its many failures, particularly because it is Chaplin's last film, it is perhaps best to cherish its wonderful, fleeting comic moments.\"<ref>Vance, Jeffrey.

It was first recorded by Bruce Woolley and the Camera Club (with [[Thomas Dolby]] on keyboards) for their album ''[[English Garden (album)|English Garden]]'', and later by British new wave/synth-pop group [[the Buggles]], consisting of Horn and Downes. The track was recorded and mixed in 1979, released as their debut single on 7 September 1979 by [[Island Records]], and included on their first album ''[[The Age of Plastic]]''. The backing track was recorded at Virgin's Town House in West London, and mixing and vocal recording would later take place at [[Sarm East Studios]].\n\nThe song relates to concerns about mixed attitudes towards 20th-century inventions and machines for the media arts. Musically, the song performs like an extended jingle and the composition plays in the key of [[D-flat major]] in [[common time]] at a [[tempo]] of 132 [[beats per minute]]. The track has been positively received, with reviewers praising its unusual musical pop elements. Although the song includes several common pop characteristics and six basic chords are used in its structure, Downes and writer Timothy Warner described the piece as musically complicated, due to its use of suspended and minor ninth chords for enhancement that gave the song a \"slightly different feel.\"\n\nUpon release, the single topped sixteen international [[Record chart|music charts]], including those in the UK, Australia, and Japan. It also peaked within the top 10 in Canada, Germany, New Zealand and South Africa, but only reached number 40 in the US. The accompanying [[music video]] was written, directed, and edited by [[Russell Mulcahy]]. It was the [[First music videos aired on MTV|first music video]] shown on [[MTV]] in the US, airing at 12:01{{nbsp}}a.m. on 1 August 1981, and the first video shown on [[MTV Classic (UK & Ireland)|MTV Classic]] in the UK on 1 March 2010.

It was first recorded by Bruce Woolley and the Camera Club (with [[Thomas Dolby]] on keyboards) for their album ''[[English Garden (album)|English Garden]]'', and later by British new wave/synth-pop group [[the Buggles]], consisting of Horn and Downes. The track was recorded and mixed in 1979, released as their debut single on 7 September 1979 by [[Island Records]], and included on their first album ''[[The Age of Plastic]]''. The backing track was recorded at Virgin's Town House in West London, and mixing and vocal recording would later take place at [[Sarm East Studios]].\n\nThe song relates to concerns about mixed attitudes towards 20th-century inventions and machines for the media arts. Musically, the song performs like an extended jingle and the composition plays in the key of [[D-flat major]] in [[common time]] at a [[tempo]] of 132 [[beats per minute]]. The track has been positively received, with reviewers praising its unusual musical pop elements. Although the song includes several common pop characteristics and six basic chords are used in its structure, Downes and writer Timothy Warner described the piece as musically complicated, due to its use of suspended and minor ninth chords for enhancement that gave the song a \"slightly different feel.\"\n\nUpon release, the single topped sixteen international [[Record chart|music charts]], including those in the UK, Australia, and Japan. It also peaked within the top 10 in Canada, Germany, New Zealand and South Africa, but only reached number 40 in the US. The accompanying [[music video]] was written, directed, and edited by [[Russell Mulcahy]]. It was the [[First music videos aired on MTV|first music video]] shown on [[MTV]] in the US, airing at 12:01{{nbsp}}a.m. on 1 August 1981, and the first video shown on [[MTV Classic (UK & Ireland)|MTV Classic]] in the UK on 1 March 2010. The song has received several critical accolades, such as being ranked number 40 on VH1's ''100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders of the '80s''.<ref name=\"VH1\">Ali, Rahsheeda (2 May 2013). {{cite web|url= http://www.vh1.com/music/tuner/2013-05-02/100-greatest-one-hit-wonders-of-the-80s/62/ |title= 100 Greatest One Hit Wonders Of The 80s: 40. \"Video Killed the Radio Star\" \u2013 The Buggles |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130505172248/http://www.vh1.com/music/tuner/2013-05-02/100-greatest-one-hit-wonders-of-the-80s/62/ |archivedate= 5 May 2013}}.

This psychological conflict causes him to ultimately suffer a breakdown, after which he eventually awakens in a sanatorium. Being saved by a sympathetic physician, who attests his insanity to keep him from being imprisoned again by the Nazis, he is finally set free.\n\nAfter happening to be on the same cruise liner as a group of chess enthusiasts and the world chess champion Czentovic, he incidentally stumbles across their game against the champion. Mirko Czentovic is a nearly illiterate and moronic peasant [[child prodigy|prodigy]] possessing no obvious redeeming qualities besides his gift for chess. Dr&nbsp;B helps the chess enthusiasts in managing to draw their game in an almost hopeless position. After this effort, they persuade him to play alone against Czentovic. In a stunning demonstration of his imaginative and combinational powers, Dr&nbsp;B sensationally beats the world champion.\n\nCzentovic immediately suggests a return game to restore his honour. But this time, having sensed that Dr&nbsp;B played quite fast and hardly took time to think, he tries to irritate his opponent by taking several minutes before making a move, thereby putting psychological pressure on Dr&nbsp;B, who gets more and more impatient as the game proceeds. His greatest power turns out to be his greatest weakness: he devolves into rehearsing imagined matches against himself repeatedly and manically. Czentovic's deliberation and placidness drive Dr B to distraction and ultimately to insanity, culminating in an incorrect statement about a check by his bishop, and then him conceding the game, after which Dr&nbsp;B awakens from his frenzy.\n\n==Historical background==\n[[File:Die Erstausgabe der Schachnovelle von Stefan Zweig.jpg|thumb|right|The first edition of ''The Royal Game'']]\nFollowing the [[Anschluss|occupation and annexation]] of Austria by [[Nazi Germany]], the country's [[monarchism|monarchists]] (i.e. supporters of [[Otto von Habsburg]] as the rightful Emperor-Archduke and the rule of the [[House of Habsburg]]), [[conservatism|conservatives]] as well as supporters of [[Engelbert Dollfuss]]' [[Austrofascism|Austrofascist]] regime, were severely persecuted by the Nazis, as they were seen as opponents of the Nazi regime.

This psychological conflict causes him to ultimately suffer a breakdown, after which he eventually awakens in a sanatorium. Being saved by a sympathetic physician, who attests his insanity to keep him from being imprisoned again by the Nazis, he is finally set free.\n\nAfter happening to be on the same cruise liner as a group of chess enthusiasts and the world chess champion Czentovic, he incidentally stumbles across their game against the champion. Mirko Czentovic is a nearly illiterate and moronic peasant [[child prodigy|prodigy]] possessing no obvious redeeming qualities besides his gift for chess. Dr&nbsp;B helps the chess enthusiasts in managing to draw their game in an almost hopeless position. After this effort, they persuade him to play alone against Czentovic. In a stunning demonstration of his imaginative and combinational powers, Dr&nbsp;B sensationally beats the world champion.\n\nCzentovic immediately suggests a return game to restore his honour. But this time, having sensed that Dr&nbsp;B played quite fast and hardly took time to think, he tries to irritate his opponent by taking several minutes before making a move, thereby putting psychological pressure on Dr&nbsp;B, who gets more and more impatient as the game proceeds. His greatest power turns out to be his greatest weakness: he devolves into rehearsing imagined matches against himself repeatedly and manically. Czentovic's deliberation and placidness drive Dr B to distraction and ultimately to insanity, culminating in an incorrect statement about a check by his bishop, and then him conceding the game, after which Dr&nbsp;B awakens from his frenzy.\n\n==Historical background==\n[[File:Die Erstausgabe der Schachnovelle von Stefan Zweig.jpg|thumb|right|The first edition of ''The Royal Game'']]\nFollowing the [[Anschluss|occupation and annexation]] of Austria by [[Nazi Germany]], the country's [[monarchism|monarchists]] (i.e. supporters of [[Otto von Habsburg]] as the rightful Emperor-Archduke and the rule of the [[House of Habsburg]]), [[conservatism|conservatives]] as well as supporters of [[Engelbert Dollfuss]]' [[Austrofascism|Austrofascist]] regime, were severely persecuted by the Nazis, as they were seen as opponents of the Nazi regime.

{"title_page": "Variational Bayesian methods", "text_new": "{{For|the method of approximation in quantum mechanics|Variational method (quantum mechanics)}}\n\n{{More footnotes|date=September 2010}}\n\n'''Variational Bayesian methods''' are a family of techniques for approximating intractable [[integral]]s arising in [[Bayesian inference]] and [[machine learning]].  They are typically used in complex [[statistical model]]s consisting of observed variables (usually termed \"data\") as well as unknown [[parameter]]s and [[latent variable]]s, with various sorts of relationships among the three types of [[random variable]]s, as might be described by a [[graphical model]].  As typical in Bayesian inference, the parameters and latent variables are grouped together as \"unobserved variables\". Variational Bayesian methods are primarily used for two purposes:\n#To provide an analytical approximation to the [[posterior probability]] of the unobserved variables, in order to do [[statistical inference]] over these variables.\n#To derive a [[lower bound]] for the [[marginal likelihood]] (sometimes called the \"evidence\") of the observed data (i.e. the [[marginal probability]] of the data given the model, with marginalization performed over unobserved variables).  This is typically used for performing [[model selection]], the general idea being that a higher marginal likelihood for a given model indicates a better fit of the data by that model and hence a greater probability that the model in question was the one that generated the data. (See also the [[Bayes factor]] article.)\n\nIn the former purpose (that of approximating a posterior probability), variational Bayes is an alternative to [[Monte Carlo sampling]] methods \u2014 particularly, [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] methods such as [[Gibbs sampling]] \u2014 for taking a fully Bayesian approach to [[statistical inference]] over complex [[probability distribution|distributions]] that are difficult to evaluate directly or [[sample (statistics)|sample]]. In particular, whereas Monte Carlo techniques provide a numerical approximation to the exact posterior using a set of samples, Variational Bayes provides a locally-optimal, exact analytical solution to an approximation of the posterior.\n\nVariational Bayes can be seen as an extension of the EM ([[expectation-maximization]]) algorithm from [[maximum a posteriori estimation]] (MAP estimation) of the single most probable value of each parameter to fully Bayesian estimation which computes (an approximation to) the entire [[posterior distribution]] of the parameters and latent variables.  As in EM, it finds a set of optimal parameter values, and it has the same alternating structure as does EM, based on a set of interlocked (mutually dependent) equations that cannot be solved analytically. \n\nFor many applications, variational Bayes produces solutions of comparable accuracy to Gibbs sampling at greater speed.  However, deriving the set of equations used to update the parameters iteratively often requires a large amount of work compared with deriving the comparable Gibbs sampling equations.  This is the case even for many models that are conceptually quite simple, as is demonstrated below in the case of a basic non-hierarchical model with only two parameters and no latent variables.\n\n==Mathematical derivation==\n\n=== Problem ===\n\nIn [[Calculus of variations|variational]] inference, the posterior distribution over a set of unobserved variables <math>\\mathbf{Z} = \\{Z_1 \\dots Z_n\\}</math> given some data <math>\\mathbf{X}</math> is approximated by a so-called '''variational distribution''', <math>Q(\\mathbf{Z})</math>:\n:<math>P(\\mathbf{Z}\\mid \\mathbf{X}) \\approx Q(\\mathbf{Z}).</math>\n\nThe distribution <math>Q(\\mathbf{Z})</math> is restricted to belong to a family of distributions of simpler form (e.g. a family of Gaussian distributions) than <math>P(\\mathbf{Z}\\mid \\mathbf{X})</math>, selected with the intention of making <math>Q(\\mathbf{Z})</math> similar to the true posterior, <math>P(\\mathbf{Z}\\mid \\mathbf{X})</math>. \n\nThe similarity (or dissimilarity) is measured in terms of a dissimilarity function <math>d(Q; P)</math> and hence inference is performed by selecting the distribution <math>Q(\\mathbf{Z})</math> that minimizes <math>d(Q; P)</math>.\n\n=== KL divergence ===\n\nThe most common type of variational Bayes uses the [[Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence]] (KL-divergence) of ''P'' from ''Q'' as the choice of dissimilarity function.  This choice makes this minimization tractable.  The KL-divergence is defined as\n\n:<math>D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(Q \\parallel P) \\triangleq \\sum_\\mathbf{Z}  Q(\\mathbf{Z}) \\log \\frac{Q(\\mathbf{Z})}{P(\\mathbf{Z}\\mid \\mathbf{X})}.</math>\n\nNote that ''Q'' and ''P'' are reversed from what one might expect.  This use of reversed KL-divergence is conceptually similar to the [[expectation-maximization algorithm]]. (Using the KL-divergence in the other way produces the [[expectation propagation]] algorithm.)\n\n=== Intractability ===\n\nVariational techniques are typically used to form an approximation for:\n\n:<math>P(\\mathbf Z \\mid \\mathbf X) = \\frac{P(\\mathbf X \\mid \\mathbf Z)P(\\mathbf Z)}{P(\\mathbf X)} = \\frac{P(\\mathbf X \\mid \\mathbf Z)P(\\mathbf Z)}{\\int_{\\mathbf Z} P(\\mathbf X,\\mathbf Z) \\,d\\mathbf Z}</math>\n\nThe marginalization over <math>\\mathbf Z</math> to calculate <math>P(\\mathbf X)</math> in the denominator is typically intractable, because, for example, the search space of <math>\\mathbf Z</math> is combinatorially large. Therefore, we seek an approximation, using <math>Q(\\mathbf Z) \\approx P(\\mathbf Z \\mid \\mathbf X)</math>.\n\n=== Evidence lower bound ===\nGiven that <math>P(\\mathbf Z \\mid \\mathbf X) = \\frac{P(\\mathbf X, \\mathbf Z)}{P(\\mathbf X)}</math>, the KL-divergence above can also be written as\n\n:<math>\nD_{\\mathrm{KL}}(Q \\parallel P) \n= \\sum_\\mathbf{Z}  Q(\\mathbf{Z}) \\left[ \\log \\frac{Q(\\mathbf{Z})}{P(\\mathbf{Z},\\mathbf{X})} + \\log P(\\mathbf{X}) \\right]\n= \\sum_\\mathbf{Z}  Q(\\mathbf{Z}) \\left[ \\log Q(\\mathbf{Z}) -  \\log P(\\mathbf{Z},\\mathbf{X}) \\right] + \\sum_\\mathbf{Z}  Q(\\mathbf{Z}) \\left[ \\log P(\\mathbf{X}) \\right] \n</math>\n\nBecause <math>P(\\mathbf{X})</math> is a constant with respect to <math>\\mathbf Z</math> and <math>\\sum_\\mathbf{Z} Q(\\mathbf{Z}) = 1</math> because <math>Q(\\mathbf{Z})</math> is a distribution, we have\n:<math>\nD_{\\mathrm{KL}}(Q \\parallel P) = \\sum_\\mathbf{Z}  Q(\\mathbf{Z}) \\left[ \\log Q(\\mathbf{Z}) -  \\log P(\\mathbf{Z},\\mathbf{X}) \\right] + \\log P(\\mathbf{X}) \n</math>\n\nwhich, according to the definition of [[expected value]] (for a discrete [[random variable]]), can be written as follows\n\n:<math>\nD_{\\mathrm{KL}}(Q \\parallel P) \n= \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf Z } \\left[ \\log Q(\\mathbf{Z}) -  \\log P(\\mathbf{Z},\\mathbf{X}) \\right] + \\log P(\\mathbf{X}) \n</math>\n\nwhich can be rearranged to become\n:<math>\n\\log P(\\mathbf{X}) =\nD_{\\mathrm{KL}}(Q \\parallel P) - \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf Z } \\left[ \\log Q(\\mathbf{Z}) -  \\log P(\\mathbf{Z},\\mathbf{X}) \\right] = D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(Q\\parallel P) + \\mathcal{L}(Q)\n</math>\n\nAs the ''log [[model evidence|evidence]]'' <math>\\log P(\\mathbf{X})</math> is fixed with respect to <math>Q</math>, maximizing the final term <math>\\mathcal{L}(Q)</math> minimizes the KL divergence of <math>Q</math> from <math>P</math>.  By appropriate choice of <math>Q</math>, <math>\\mathcal{L}(Q)</math> becomes tractable to compute and to maximize. Hence we have both an analytical approximation <math>Q</math> for the posterior <math>P(\\mathbf{Z}\\mid \\mathbf{X})</math>, and a lower bound <math>\\mathcal{L}(Q)</math> for the evidence <math>\\log P(\\mathbf{X})</math> (since the KL-divergence is always strictly non-negative). \n\nThe lower bound <math>\\mathcal{L}(Q)</math> is known as the (negative) '''variational free energy''' in analogy with [[thermodynamic free energy]] because it can also be expressed as a negative \"energy\" <math>\\operatorname{E}_{Q}[\\log P(\\mathbf{Z},\\mathbf{X})]</math> plus the entropy of <math>Q</math>. The term <math>\\mathcal{L}(Q)</math> is also known as '''Evidence Lower BOund''', abbreviated as '''ELBO''', to emphasize that it is a lower bound on the evidence of the data.\n\n=== Proofs ===\n\nBy generalized Pythagorean theorem of [[Bregman divergence]], of which KL-divergence is a special case, it can be shown that <ref name=Tran2018>{{cite arxiv|title=Copula Variational Bayes inference via information geometry|first1=Viet Hung|last1=Tran|year=2018|eprint=1803.10998|class=cs.IT}}</ref><ref name=\"Martin2014\"/>:\n[[File:Bregman_divergence_Pythagorean.png|right|300px|thumb|Generalized Pythagorean theorem for [[Bregman divergence]] \n<ref name=\"Martin2014\">{{cite journal |last1=Adam\u010d\u00edk |first1=Martin |title=The Information Geometry of Bregman Divergences and Some Applications in Multi-Expert Reasoning |journal=Entropy |date=2014 |volume=16 |issue=12 |page=6338\u20136381|bibcode=2014Entrp..16.6338A |doi=10.3390/e16126338 |doi-access=free }}</ref>.]]\n:<math> \nD_{\\mathrm{KL}}(Q\\parallel P) \\geq D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(Q\\parallel Q^{*}) + D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(Q^{*}\\parallel P), \\forall Q^{*} \\in\\mathcal{C}\n</math>\n\nwhere  <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> is a convex set and the equality holds if: \n\n:<math> Q = Q^{*} \\triangleq \\arg\\min_{Q\\in\\mathcal{C}}D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(Q\\parallel P). </math>\n\nIn this case, the global minimizer <math>Q^{*}(\\mathbf{Z}) = q^{*}(\\mathbf{Z}_1\\mid\\mathbf{Z}_2)q^{*}(\\mathbf{Z}_2) = q^{*}(\\mathbf{Z}_2\\mid\\mathbf{Z}_1)q^{*}(\\mathbf{Z}_1),</math> with <math>\\mathbf{Z}=\\{\\mathbf{Z_1},\\mathbf{Z_2}\\},</math> can be found as follows <ref name=Tran2018/>:\n\n:<math> q^{*}(\\mathbf{Z}_2) \n= \\frac{P(\\mathbf{X})}{\\zeta(\\mathbf{X})}\\frac{P(\\mathbf{Z}_2\\mid\\mathbf{X})}{\\exp(D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(q^{*}(\\mathbf{Z}_1\\mid\\mathbf{Z}_2)\\parallel P(\\mathbf{Z}_1\\mid\\mathbf{Z}_2,\\mathbf{X})))} \n= \\frac{1}{\\zeta(\\mathbf{X})}\\exp\\mathbb{E}_{q^{*}(\\mathbf{Z}_1\\mid\\mathbf{Z}_2)}\\left(\\log\\frac{P(\\mathbf{Z},\\mathbf{X})}{q^{*}(\\mathbf{Z}_1\\mid\\mathbf{Z}_2)}\\right),</math>\n\nin which the normalizing constant is: \n\n:<math>\\zeta(\\mathbf{X}) \n=P(\\mathbf{X})\\int_{\\mathbf{Z}_2}\\frac{P(\\mathbf{Z}_2\\mid\\mathbf{X})}{\\exp(D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(q^{*}(\\mathbf{Z}_1\\mid\\mathbf{Z}_2)\\parallel P(\\mathbf{Z}_1\\mid\\mathbf{Z}_2,\\mathbf{X})))}\n= \\int_{\\mathbf{Z}_{2}}\\exp\\mathbb{E}_{q^{*}(\\mathbf{Z}_1\\mid\\mathbf{Z}_2)}\\left(\\log\\frac{P(\\mathbf{Z},\\mathbf{X})}{q^{*}(\\mathbf{Z}_1\\mid\\mathbf{Z}_2)}\\right).</math>\n\nThe term <math>\\zeta(\\mathbf{X})</math> is often called the [[model evidence|evidence]] lower bound ('''ELBO''') in practice, since <math>P(\\mathbf{X})\\geq\\zeta(\\mathbf{X})=\\exp(\\mathcal{L}(Q^{*}))</math><ref name=Tran2018/>, as shown above.\n\nBy interchanging the roles of <math>\\mathbf{Z}_1</math> and <math>\\mathbf{Z}_2,</math> we can iteratively compute the approximated <math>q^{*}(\\mathbf{Z}_1)</math> and <math>q^{*}(\\mathbf{Z}_2)</math> of the true model's marginals <math>P(\\mathbf{Z}_1\\mid\\mathbf{X})</math> and <math>P(\\mathbf{Z}_2\\mid\\mathbf{X}),</math> respectively. Although this iterative scheme is guaranteed to converge monotonically <ref name=Tran2018/>, the converged <math>Q^{*}</math> is only a local minimizer of <math>D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(Q\\parallel P)</math>.\n\nIf the constrained space <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> is confined within independent space, i.e. <math>q^{*}(\\mathbf{Z}_1\\mid\\mathbf{Z}_2) = q^{*}(\\mathbf{Z_1}),</math>the above iterative scheme will become the so-called mean field approximation <math>Q^{*}(\\mathbf{Z}) = q^{*}(\\mathbf{Z}_1)q^{*}(\\mathbf{Z}_2),</math>as shown below.\n\n==Mean field approximation==\nThe variational distribution <math>Q(\\mathbf{Z})</math> is usually assumed to factorize over some [[partition of a set|partition]] of the latent variables, i.e. for some partition of the latent variables <math>\\mathbf{Z}</math> into <math>\\mathbf{Z}_1 \\dots \\mathbf{Z}_M</math>,\n\n:<math>Q(\\mathbf{Z}) = \\prod_{i=1}^M q_i(\\mathbf{Z}_i\\mid \\mathbf{X})</math>\n\nIt can be shown using the [[calculus of variations]] (hence the name \"variational Bayes\") that the \"best\" distribution <math>q_j^{*}</math> for each of the factors <math>q_j</math> (in terms of the distribution minimizing the KL divergence, as described above) can be expressed as:\n\n:<math>q_j^{*}(\\mathbf{Z}_j\\mid \\mathbf{X}) = \\frac{e^{\\operatorname{E}_{i \\neq j} [\\ln p(\\mathbf{Z}, \\mathbf{X})]}}{\\int e^{\\operatorname{E}_{i \\neq j} [\\ln p(\\mathbf{Z}, \\mathbf{X})]}\\, d\\mathbf{Z}_j}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\operatorname{E}_{i \\neq j} [\\ln p(\\mathbf{Z}, \\mathbf{X})]</math> is the [[expected value|expectation]] of the logarithm of the [[joint probability]] of the data and latent variables, taken over all variables not in the partition.\n\nIn practice, we usually work in terms of logarithms, i.e.:\n\n:<math>\\ln q_j^{*}(\\mathbf{Z}_j\\mid \\mathbf{X}) = \\operatorname{E}_{i \\neq j} [\\ln p(\\mathbf{Z}, \\mathbf{X})] + \\text{constant}</math>\n\nThe constant in the above expression is related to the [[normalizing constant]] (the denominator in the expression above for <math>q_j^{*}</math>) and is usually reinstated by inspection, as the rest of the expression can usually be recognized as being a known type of distribution (e.g. [[Gaussian distribution|Gaussian]], [[gamma distribution|gamma]], etc.).\n\nUsing the properties of expectations, the expression <math>\\operatorname{E}_{i \\neq j} [\\ln p(\\mathbf{Z}, \\mathbf{X})]</math> can usually be simplified into a function of the fixed [[hyperparameter]]s of the [[prior distribution]]s over the latent variables and of expectations (and sometimes higher [[moment (mathematics)|moment]]s such as the [[variance]]) of latent variables not in the current partition (i.e. latent variables not included in <math>\\mathbf{Z}_j</math>). This creates [[circular dependency|circular dependencies]] between the parameters of the distributions over variables in one partition and the expectations of variables in the other partitions.  This naturally suggests an [[iterative]] algorithm, much like EM (the [[expectation-maximization]] algorithm), in which the expectations (and possibly higher moments) of the latent variables are initialized in some fashion (perhaps randomly), and then the parameters of each distribution are computed in turn using the current values of the expectations, after which the expectation of the newly computed distribution is set appropriately according to the computed parameters. An algorithm of this sort is guaranteed to [[limit of a sequence|converge]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Convex Optimization|first1=Stephen P.|last1=Boyd|first2=Lieven|last2=Vandenberghe|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-83378-3|url=https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=October 15, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn other words, for each of the partitions of variables, by simplifying the expression for the distribution over the partition's variables and examining the distribution's functional dependency on the variables in question, the family of the distribution can usually be determined (which in turn determines the value of the constant).  The formula for the distribution's parameters will be expressed in terms of the prior distributions' hyperparameters (which are known constants), but also in terms of expectations of functions of variables in other partitions.  Usually these expectations can be simplified into functions of expectations of the variables themselves (i.e. the [[mean]]s); sometimes expectations of squared variables (which can be related to the [[variance]] of the variables), or expectations of higher powers (i.e. higher [[moment (mathematics)|moment]]s) also appear. In most cases, the other variables' distributions will be from known families, and the formulas for the relevant expectations can be looked up. However, those formulas depend on those distributions' parameters, which depend in turn on the expectations about other variables. The result is that the formulas for the parameters of each variable's distributions can be expressed as a series of equations with mutual, [[nonlinear]] dependencies among the variables. Usually, it is not possible to solve this system of equations directly. However, as described above, the dependencies suggest a simple iterative algorithm, which in most cases is guaranteed to converge. An example will make this process clearer.\n\n==A basic example==\nConsider a simple non-hierarchical Bayesian model consisting of a set of [[independent identically distributed|i.i.d.]] observations from a [[Gaussian distribution]], with unknown [[mean]] and [[variance]].<ref name = bishop>Based on Chapter 10 of ''Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning'' by [[Christopher M. Bishop]]</ref> In the following, we work through this model in great detail to illustrate the workings of the variational Bayes method.\n\nFor mathematical convenience, in the following example we work in terms of the [[precision (statistics)|precision]] \u2014 i.e. the reciprocal of the variance (or in a multivariate Gaussian, the inverse of the [[covariance matrix]]) \u2014 rather than the variance itself.  (From a theoretical standpoint, precision and variance are equivalent since there is a [[one-to-one correspondence]] between the two.)\n\n===The mathematical model===\nWe place [[conjugate prior]] distributions on the unknown mean <math>\\mu</math> and precision <math>\\tau</math>, i.e. the mean also follows a Gaussian distribution while the precision follows a [[gamma distribution]].  In other words:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\tau & \\sim \\operatorname{Gamma}(a_0, b_0) \\\\\n\\mu & \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_0, (\\lambda_0 \\tau)^{-1}) \\\\\n\\{x_1, \\dots, x_N\\} & \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\tau^{-1}) \\\\\nN &= \\text{number of data points}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe [[hyperparameter]]s <math>\\mu_0, \\lambda_0, a_0</math> and <math>b_0</math> in the prior distributions are fixed, given values.  They can be set to small positive numbers to give broad prior distributions indicating ignorance about the prior distributions of <math>\\mu</math> and <math>\\tau</math>.\n\nWe are given <math>N</math> data points <math>\\mathbf{X} = \\{x_1, \\ldots, x_N\\}</math> and our goal is to infer the [[posterior distribution]] <math>q(\\mu, \\tau)=p(\\mu,\\tau\\mid x_1, \\ldots, x_N)</math> of the parameters <math>\\mu</math> and <math>\\tau.</math>\n\n===The joint probability===\nThe [[joint probability]] of all variables can be rewritten as\n\n:<math>p(\\mathbf{X},\\mu,\\tau) = p(\\mathbf{X}\\mid \\mu,\\tau) p(\\mu\\mid \\tau) p(\\tau)</math>\n\nwhere the individual factors are\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\np(\\mathbf{X}\\mid \\mu,\\tau) & = \\prod_{n=1}^N \\mathcal{N}(x_n\\mid \\mu,\\tau^{-1}) \\\\\np(\\mu\\mid \\tau) & = \\mathcal{N} \\left (\\mu\\mid \\mu_0, (\\lambda_0 \\tau)^{-1} \\right ) \\\\\np(\\tau) & = \\operatorname{Gamma}(\\tau\\mid a_0, b_0)\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathcal{N}(x\\mid \\mu,\\sigma^2) & = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} e^{\\frac{-(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}} \\\\\n\\operatorname{Gamma}(\\tau\\mid a,b) & = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(a)} b^a \\tau^{a-1} e^{-b \\tau}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n===Factorized approximation===\nAssume that <math>q(\\mu,\\tau) = q(\\mu)q(\\tau)</math>, i.e. that the posterior distribution factorizes into independent factors for <math>\\mu</math> and <math>\\tau</math>.  This type of assumption underlies the variational Bayesian method.  The true posterior distribution does not in fact factor this way (in fact, in this simple case, it is known to be a [[Gaussian-gamma distribution]]), and hence the result we obtain will be an approximation.\n\n===Derivation of {{math|q(&mu;)}}===\nThen\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\ln q_\\mu^*(\\mu) &= \\operatorname{E}_\\tau\\left[\\ln p(\\mathbf{X}\\mid \\mu,\\tau) + \\ln p(\\mu\\mid \\tau) + \\ln p(\\tau)\\right] + C \\\\\n &= \\operatorname{E}_\\tau\\left[\\ln p(\\mathbf{X}\\mid \\mu,\\tau)\\right] + \\operatorname{E}_\\tau\\left[\\ln p(\\mu\\mid \\tau)\\right] + \\operatorname{E}_{\\tau}\\left[\\ln p(\\tau)\\right] + C \\\\\n &= \\operatorname{E}_\\tau\\left[\\ln \\prod_{n=1}^N \\mathcal{N} \\left (x_n\\mid \\mu,\\tau^{-1} \\right )\\right] + \\operatorname{E}_\\tau\\left[\\ln \\mathcal{N} \\left (\\mu\\mid \\mu_0, (\\lambda_0 \\tau)^{-1} \\right )\\right] + C_2 \\\\\n &= \\operatorname{E}_\\tau\\left[\\ln \\prod_{n=1}^N \\sqrt{\\frac{\\tau}{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{(x_n-\\mu)^2\\tau}{2}}\\right] + \\operatorname{E}_{\\tau}\\left[\\ln \\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda_0 \\tau}{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{(\\mu-\\mu_0)^2\\lambda_0 \\tau}{2}}\\right] + C_2 \\\\\n &= \\operatorname{E}_{\\tau}\\left[\\sum_{n=1}^N \\left(\\frac{1}{2}(\\ln\\tau - \\ln 2\\pi) - \\frac{(x_n-\\mu)^2\\tau}{2}\\right)\\right] + \\operatorname{E}_{\\tau}\\left[\\frac{1}{2}(\\ln \\lambda_0 + \\ln \\tau - \\ln 2\\pi) - \\frac{(\\mu-\\mu_0)^2\\lambda_0 \\tau}{2}\\right] + C_2 \\\\\n &= \\operatorname{E}_{\\tau}\\left[\\sum_{n=1}^N -\\frac{(x_n-\\mu)^2\\tau}{2}\\right] + \\operatorname{E}_{\\tau}\\left[-\\frac{(\\mu-\\mu_0)^2\\lambda_0 \\tau}{2}\\right] + \\operatorname{E}_{\\tau}\\left[\\sum_{n=1}^N \\frac{1}{2}(\\ln\\tau - \\ln 2\\pi)\\right] + \\operatorname{E}_{\\tau}\\left[\\frac{1}{2}(\\ln \\lambda_0 + \\ln \\tau - \\ln 2\\pi)\\right] + C_2 \\\\\n &= \\operatorname{E}_{\\tau}\\left[\\sum_{n=1}^N -\\frac{(x_n-\\mu)^2\\tau}{2}\\right] + \\operatorname{E}_{\\tau}\\left[-\\frac{(\\mu-\\mu_0)^2\\lambda_0 \\tau}{2}\\right] + C_3 \\\\\n &= - \\frac{\\operatorname{E}_{\\tau}[\\tau]}{2} \\left\\{ \\sum_{n=1}^N (x_n-\\mu)^2 + \\lambda_0(\\mu-\\mu_0)^2 \\right\\} + C_3\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nIn the above derivation, <math>C</math>, <math>C_2</math> and <math>C_3</math> refer to values that are constant with respect to <math>\\mu</math>.

We can expand the expectations, using the standard formulas for the expectations of moments of the Gaussian and gamma distributions:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\operatorname{E}[\\tau\\mid a_N, b_N] &= \\frac{a_N}{b_N} \\\\\n\\operatorname{E} \\left [\\mu\\mid\\mu_N,\\lambda_N^{-1} \\right ] &= \\mu_N \\\\\n\\operatorname{E}\\left[X^2 \\right] &= \\operatorname{Var}(X) + (\\operatorname{E}[X])^2 \\\\\n\\operatorname{E} \\left [\\mu^2\\mid\\mu_N,\\lambda_N^{-1} \\right ] &= \\lambda_N^{-1} + \\mu_N^2\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nApplying these formulas to the above equations is trivial in most cases, but the equation for <math>b_N</math> takes more work:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nb_N &= b_0 + \\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{E}_\\mu \\left[\\sum_{n=1}^N (x_n-\\mu)^2 + \\lambda_0(\\mu - \\mu_0)^2\\right] \\\\\n    &= b_0 + \\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{E}_\\mu \\left[ (\\lambda_0+N)\\mu^2 -2 \\left (\\lambda_0\\mu_0 + \\sum_{n=1}^N x_n \\right )\\mu + \\left(\\sum_{n=1}^N x_n^2 \\right ) + \\lambda_0\\mu_0^2 \\right] \\\\\n    &= b_0 + \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (\\lambda_0+N)\\operatorname{E}_\\mu[\\mu^2] -2 \\left (\\lambda_0\\mu_0 + \\sum_{n=1}^N x_n \\right)\\operatorname{E}_\\mu [\\mu] + \\left (\\sum_{n=1}^N x_n^2 \\right ) + \\lambda_0\\mu_0^2 \\right] \\\\\n    &= b_0 + \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (\\lambda_0+N) \\left (\\lambda_N^{-1} + \\mu_N^2 \\right ) -2 \\left (\\lambda_0\\mu_0 + \\sum_{n=1}^N x_n \\right)\\mu_N + \\left(\\sum_{n=1}^N x_n^2 \\right) + \\lambda_0\\mu_0^2 \\right] \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nWe can then write the parameter equations as follows, without any expectations:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\mu_N &= \\frac{\\lambda_0 \\mu_0 + N \\bar{x}}{\\lambda_0 + N} \\\\\n\\lambda_N &= (\\lambda_0 + N) \\frac{a_N}{b_N} \\\\\n\\bar{x} &= \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{n=1}^N x_n \\\\\na_N &= a_0 + \\frac{N+1}{2} \\\\\nb_N &= b_0 + \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (\\lambda_0+N) \\left (\\lambda_N^{-1} + \\mu_N^2 \\right ) -2 \\left (\\lambda_0\\mu_0 + \\sum_{n=1}^N x_n \\right )\\mu_N + \\left (\\sum_{n=1}^N x_n^2 \\right ) + \\lambda_0\\mu_0^2 \\right]\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nNote that there are circular dependencies among the formulas for <math>\\lambda_N</math>and <math>b_N</math>.  This naturally suggests an [[expectation-maximization algorithm|EM]]-like algorithm:\n\n#Compute <math>\\sum_{n=1}^N x_n</math> and <math>\\sum_{n=1}^N x_n^2.</math> Use these values to compute <math>\\mu_N</math> and <math>a_N.</math>\n#Initialize <math>\\lambda_N</math> to some arbitrary value.\n#Use the current value of <math>\\lambda_N,</math> along with the known values of the other parameters, to compute <math>b_N</math>.\n#Use the current value of <math>b_N,</math> along with the known values of the other parameters, to compute <math>\\lambda_N</math>.\n#Repeat the last two steps until convergence (i.e. until neither value has changed more than some small amount).\n\nWe then have values for the hyperparameters of the approximating distributions of the posterior parameters, which we can use to compute any properties we want of the posterior \u2014 e.g. its mean and variance, a 95% highest-density region (the smallest interval that includes 95% of the total probability), etc.\n\nIt can be shown that this algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum.\n\nNote also that the posterior distributions have the same form as the corresponding prior distributions.  We did ''not'' assume this; the only assumption we made was that the distributions factorize, and the form of the distributions followed naturally.  It turns out (see below) that the fact that the posterior distributions have the same form as the prior distributions is not a coincidence, but a general result whenever the prior distributions are members of the [[exponential family]], which is the case for most of the standard distributions.\n\n==Further discussion==\n\n===Step-by-step recipe===\nThe above example shows the method by which the variational-Bayesian approximation to a [[posterior probability]] density in a given [[Bayesian network]] is derived:\n#Describe the network with a [[graphical model]], identifying the observed variables (data) <math>\\mathbf{X}</math> and unobserved variables ([[parameter]]s <math>\\boldsymbol\\Theta</math> and [[latent variable]]s <math>\\mathbf{Z}</math>) and their [[conditional probability distribution]]s.  Variational Bayes will then construct an approximation to the posterior probability <math>p(\\mathbf{Z},\\boldsymbol\\Theta\\mid\\mathbf{X})</math>.  The approximation has the basic property that it is a factorized distribution, i.e. a product of two or more [[statistical independence|independent]] distributions over disjoint subsets of the unobserved variables.\n#Partition the unobserved variables into two or more subsets, over which the independent factors will be derived.  There is no universal procedure for doing this; creating too many subsets yields a poor approximation, while creating too few makes the entire variational Bayes procedure intractable.  Typically, the first split is to separate the parameters and latent variables; often, this is enough by itself to produce a tractable result.  Assume that the partitions are called <math>\\mathbf{Z}_1,\\ldots,\\mathbf{Z}_M</math>.\n#For a given partition <math>\\mathbf{Z}_j</math>, write down the formula for the best approximating distribution <math>q_j^{*}(\\mathbf{Z}_j\\mid \\mathbf{X})</math> using the basic equation <math>\\ln q_j^{*}(\\mathbf{Z}_j\\mid \\mathbf{X}) = \\operatorname{E}_{i \\neq j} [\\ln p(\\mathbf{Z}, \\mathbf{X})] + \\text{constant}</math> .\n#Fill in the formula for the [[joint probability distribution]] using the graphical model.  Any component conditional distributions that don't involve any of the variables in <math>\\mathbf{Z}_j</math> can be ignored; they will be folded into the constant term.\n#Simplify the formula and apply the expectation operator, following the above example.  Ideally, this should simplify into expectations of basic functions of variables not in <math>\\mathbf{Z}_j</math> (e.g. first or second raw [[moment (mathematics)|moment]]s, expectation of a logarithm, etc.).  In order for the variational Bayes procedure to work well, these expectations should generally be expressible analytically as functions of the parameters and/or [[hyperparameter]]s of the distributions of these variables.  In all cases, these expectation terms are constants with respect to the variables in the current partition.\n#The functional form of the formula with respect to the variables in the current partition indicates the type of distribution.  In particular, exponentiating the formula generates the [[probability density function]] (PDF) of the distribution (or at least, something proportional to it, with unknown [[normalization constant]]).  In order for the overall method to be tractable, it should be possible to recognize the functional form as belonging to a known distribution.  Significant mathematical manipulation may be required to convert the formula into a form that matches the PDF of a known distribution.  When this can be done, the normalization constant can be reinstated by definition, and equations for the parameters of the known distribution can be derived by extracting the appropriate parts of the formula.\n#When all expectations can be replaced analytically with functions of variables not in the current partition, and the PDF put into a form that allows identification with a known distribution, the result is a set of equations expressing the values of the optimum parameters as functions of the parameters of variables in other partitions.\n#When this procedure can be applied to all partitions, the result is a set of mutually linked equations specifying the optimum values of all parameters.\n#An [[expectation maximization]] (EM) type procedure is then applied, picking an initial value for each parameter and the iterating through a series of steps, where at each step we cycle through the equations, updating each parameter in turn.  This is guaranteed to converge.\n\n===Most important points===\nDue to all of the mathematical manipulations involved, it is easy to lose track of the big picture.  The important things are:\n#The idea of variational Bayes is to construct an analytical approximation to the [[posterior probability]] of the set of unobserved variables (parameters and latent variables), given the data.  This means that the form of the solution is similar to other [[Bayesian inference]] methods, such as [[Gibbs sampling]] \u2014 i.e. a distribution that seeks to describe everything that is known about the variables.  As in other Bayesian methods \u2014 but unlike e.g. in [[expectation maximization]] (EM) or other [[maximum likelihood]] methods \u2014 both types of unobserved variables (i.e. parameters and latent variables) are treated the same, i.e. as [[random variable]]s.  Estimates for the variables can then be derived in the standard Bayesian ways, e.g. calculating the mean of the distribution to get a single point estimate or deriving a [[credible interval]], highest density region, etc.\n#\"Analytical approximation\" means that a formula can be written down for the posterior distribution.  The formula generally consists of a product of well-known probability distributions, each of which ''factorizes'' over a set of unobserved variables (i.e. it is [[conditionally independent]] of the other variables, given the observed data).  This formula is not the true posterior distribution, but an approximation to it; in particular, it will generally agree fairly closely in the lowest [[moment (mathematics)|moment]]s of the unobserved variables, e.g. the [[mean]] and [[variance]].\n#The result of all of the mathematical manipulations is (1) the identity of the probability distributions making up the factors, and (2) mutually dependent formulas for the parameters of these distributions.  The actual values of these parameters are computed numerically, through an alternating iterative procedure much like EM.\n\n===Compared with expectation maximization (EM)===\nVariational Bayes (VB) is often compared with [[expectation maximization]] (EM).  The actual numerical procedure is quite similar, in that both are alternating iterative procedures that successively converge on optimum parameter values.  The initial steps to derive the respective procedures are also vaguely similar, both starting out with formulas for probability densities and both involving significant amounts of mathematical manipulations.\n\nHowever, there are a number of differences.  Most important is ''what'' is being computed.\n*EM computes point estimates of posterior distribution of those random variables that can be categorized as \"parameters\", but only estimates of the actual posterior distributions of the latent variables (at least in \"soft EM\", and often only when the latent variables are discrete).  The point estimates computed are the [[mode (statistics)|mode]]s of these parameters; no other information is available.\n*VB, on the other hand, computes estimates of the actual posterior distribution of all variables, both parameters and latent variables.  When point estimates need to be derived, generally the [[mean]] is used rather than the mode, as is normal in Bayesian inference.  Concomitant with this, the parameters computed in VB do ''not'' have the same significance as those in EM.  EM computes optimum values of the parameters of the Bayes network itself.  VB computes optimum values of the parameters of the distributions used to approximate the parameters and latent variables of the Bayes network.  For example, a typical Gaussian [[mixture model]] will have parameters for the mean and variance of each of the mixture components.  EM would directly estimate optimum values for these parameters.  VB, however, would first fit a distribution to these parameters \u2014 typically in the form of a [[prior distribution]], e.g. a [[normal-scaled inverse gamma distribution]] \u2014 and would then compute values for the parameters of this prior distribution, i.e. essentially [[hyperparameters]].  In this case, VB would compute optimum estimates of the four parameters of the normal-scaled inverse gamma distribution that describes the joint distribution of the mean and variance of the component.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==A more complex example==\n{{Dispute about|Equation correctness| date=April 2018}}\n[[File:bayesian-gaussian-mixture-vb.svg|right|300px|thumb|Bayesian Gaussian mixture model using [[plate notation]].

They are typically used in complex [[statistical model]]s consisting of observed variables (usually termed \"data\") as well as unknown [[parameter]]s and [[latent variable]]s, with various sorts of relationships among the three types of [[random variable]]s, as might be described by a [[graphical model]].  As typical in Bayesian inference, the parameters and latent variables are grouped together as \"unobserved variables\". Variational Bayesian methods are primarily used for two purposes:\n#To provide an analytical approximation to the [[posterior probability]] of the unobserved variables, in order to do [[statistical inference]] over these variables.\n#To derive a [[lower bound]] for the [[marginal likelihood]] (sometimes called the \"evidence\") of the observed data (i.e. the [[marginal probability]] of the data given the model, with marginalization performed over unobserved variables).  This is typically used for performing [[model selection]], the general idea being that a higher marginal likelihood for a given model indicates a better fit of the data by that model and hence a greater probability that the model in question was the one that generated the data. (See also the [[Bayes factor]] article.)\n\nIn the former purpose (that of approximating a posterior probability), variational Bayes is an alternative to [[Monte Carlo sampling]] methods \u2014 particularly, [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] methods such as [[Gibbs sampling]] \u2014 for taking a fully Bayesian approach to [[statistical inference]] over complex [[probability distribution|distributions]] that are difficult to evaluate directly or [[sample (statistics)|sample]]. In particular, whereas Monte Carlo techniques provide a numerical approximation to the exact posterior using a set of samples, Variational Bayes provides a locally-optimal, exact analytical solution to an approximation of the posterior.\n\nVariational Bayes can be seen as an extension of the EM ([[expectation-maximization]]) algorithm from [[maximum a posteriori estimation]] (MAP estimation) of the single most probable value of each parameter to fully Bayesian estimation which computes (an approximation to) the entire [[posterior distribution]] of the parameters and latent variables.  As in EM, it finds a set of optimal parameter values, and it has the same alternating structure as does EM, based on a set of interlocked (mutually dependent) equations that cannot be solved analytically. \n\nFor many applications, variational Bayes produces solutions of comparable accuracy to Gibbs sampling at greater speed.  However, deriving the set of equations used to update the parameters iteratively often requires a large amount of work compared with deriving the comparable Gibbs sampling equations.  This is the case even for many models that are conceptually quite simple, as is demonstrated below in the case of a basic non-hierarchical model with only two parameters and no latent variables.\n\n==Mathematical derivation==\n\n=== Problem ===\n\nIn [[Calculus of variations|variational]] inference, the posterior distribution over a set of unobserved variables <math>\\mathbf{Z} = \\{Z_1 \\dots Z_n\\}</math> given some data <math>\\mathbf{X}</math> is approximated by a so-called '''variational distribution''', <math>Q(\\mathbf{Z})</math>:\n:<math>P(\\mathbf{Z}\\mid \\mathbf{X}) \\approx Q(\\mathbf{Z}).</math>\n\nThe distribution <math>Q(\\mathbf{Z})</math> is restricted to belong to a family of distributions of simpler form (e.g. a family of Gaussian distributions) than <math>P(\\mathbf{Z}\\mid \\mathbf{X})</math>, selected with the intention of making <math>Q(\\mathbf{Z})</math> similar to the true posterior, <math>P(\\mathbf{Z}\\mid \\mathbf{X})</math>. \n\nThe similarity (or dissimilarity) is measured in terms of a dissimilarity function <math>d(Q; P)</math> and hence inference is performed by selecting the distribution <math>Q(\\mathbf{Z})</math> that minimizes <math>d(Q; P)</math>.\n\n=== KL divergence ===\n\nThe most common type of variational Bayes uses the [[Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence]] (KL-divergence) of ''P'' from ''Q'' as the choice of dissimilarity function.  This choice makes this minimization tractable.  The KL-divergence is defined as\n\n:<math>D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(Q \\parallel P) \\triangleq \\sum_\\mathbf{Z}  Q(\\mathbf{Z}) \\log \\frac{Q(\\mathbf{Z})}{P(\\mathbf{Z}\\mid \\mathbf{X})}.</math>\n\nNote that ''Q'' and ''P'' are reversed from what one might expect.  This use of reversed KL-divergence is conceptually similar to the [[expectation-maximization algorithm]]. (Using the KL-divergence in the other way produces the [[expectation propagation]] algorithm.)\n\n=== Intractability ===\n\nVariational techniques are typically used to form an approximation for:\n\n:<math>P(\\mathbf Z \\mid \\mathbf X) = \\frac{P(\\mathbf X \\mid \\mathbf Z)P(\\mathbf Z)}{P(\\mathbf X)} = \\frac{P(\\mathbf X \\mid \\mathbf Z)P(\\mathbf Z)}{\\int_{\\mathbf Z} P(\\mathbf X,\\mathbf Z) \\,d\\mathbf Z}</math>\n\nThe marginalization over <math>\\mathbf Z</math> to calculate <math>P(\\mathbf X)</math> in the denominator is typically intractable, because, for example, the search space of <math>\\mathbf Z</math> is combinatorially large. Therefore, we seek an approximation, using <math>Q(\\mathbf Z) \\approx P(\\mathbf Z \\mid \\mathbf X)</math>.\n\n=== Evidence lower bound ===\nGiven that <math>P(\\mathbf Z \\mid \\mathbf X) = \\frac{P(\\mathbf X, \\mathbf Z)}{P(\\mathbf X)}</math>, the KL-divergence above can also be written as\n\n:<math>\nD_{\\mathrm{KL}}(Q \\parallel P) \n= \\sum_\\mathbf{Z}  Q(\\mathbf{Z}) \\left[ \\log \\frac{Q(\\mathbf{Z})}{P(\\mathbf{Z},\\mathbf{X})} + \\log P(\\mathbf{X}) \\right]\n= \\sum_\\mathbf{Z}  Q(\\mathbf{Z}) \\left[ \\log Q(\\mathbf{Z}) -  \\log P(\\mathbf{Z},\\mathbf{X}) \\right] + \\sum_\\mathbf{Z}  Q(\\mathbf{Z}) \\left[ \\log P(\\mathbf{X}) \\right] \n</math>\n\nBecause <math>P(\\mathbf{X})</math> is a constant with respect to <math>\\mathbf Z</math> and <math>\\sum_\\mathbf{Z} Q(\\mathbf{Z}) = 1</math> because <math>Q(\\mathbf{Z})</math> is a distribution, we have\n:<math>\nD_{\\mathrm{KL}}(Q \\parallel P) = \\sum_\\mathbf{Z}  Q(\\mathbf{Z}) \\left[ \\log Q(\\mathbf{Z}) -  \\log P(\\mathbf{Z},\\mathbf{X}) \\right] + \\log P(\\mathbf{X}) \n</math>\n\nwhich, according to the definition of [[expected value]] (for a discrete [[random variable]]), can be written as follows\n\n:<math>\nD_{\\mathrm{KL}}(Q \\parallel P) \n= \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf Z } \\left[ \\log Q(\\mathbf{Z}) -  \\log P(\\mathbf{Z},\\mathbf{X}) \\right] + \\log P(\\mathbf{X}) \n</math>\n\nwhich can be rearranged to become\n:<math>\n\\log P(\\mathbf{X}) =\nD_{\\mathrm{KL}}(Q \\parallel P) - \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf Z } \\left[ \\log Q(\\mathbf{Z}) -  \\log P(\\mathbf{Z},\\mathbf{X}) \\right] = D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(Q\\parallel P) + \\mathcal{L}(Q)\n</math>\n\nAs the ''log [[model evidence|evidence]]'' <math>\\log P(\\mathbf{X})</math> is fixed with respect to <math>Q</math>, maximizing the final term <math>\\mathcal{L}(Q)</math> minimizes the KL divergence of <math>P</math> from <math>Q</math>.

This creates [[circular dependency|circular dependencies]] between the parameters of the distributions over variables in one partition and the expectations of variables in the other partitions.  This naturally suggests an [[iterative]] algorithm, much like EM (the [[expectation-maximization]] algorithm), in which the expectations (and possibly higher moments) of the latent variables are initialized in some fashion (perhaps randomly), and then the parameters of each distribution are computed in turn using the current values of the expectations, after which the expectation of the newly computed distribution is set appropriately according to the computed parameters. An algorithm of this sort is guaranteed to [[limit of a sequence|converge]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Convex Optimization|first1=Stephen P.|last1=Boyd|first2=Lieven|last2=Vandenberghe|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-83378-3|url=https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=October 15, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn other words, for each of the partitions of variables, by simplifying the expression for the distribution over the partition's variables and examining the distribution's functional dependency on the variables in question, the family of the distribution can usually be determined (which in turn determines the value of the constant).  The formula for the distribution's parameters will be expressed in terms of the prior distributions' hyperparameters (which are known constants), but also in terms of expectations of functions of variables in other partitions.  Usually these expectations can be simplified into functions of expectations of the variables themselves (i.e. the [[mean]]s); sometimes expectations of squared variables (which can be related to the [[variance]] of the variables), or expectations of higher powers (i.e. higher [[moment (mathematics)|moment]]s) also appear. In most cases, the other variables' distributions will be from known families, and the formulas for the relevant expectations can be looked up. However, those formulas depend on those distributions' parameters, which depend in turn on the expectations about other variables. The result is that the formulas for the parameters of each variable's distributions can be expressed as a series of equations with mutual, [[nonlinear]] dependencies among the variables. Usually, it is not possible to solve this system of equations directly. However, as described above, the dependencies suggest a simple iterative algorithm, which in most cases is guaranteed to converge. An example will make this process clearer.\n\n==A basic example==\nConsider a simple non-hierarchical Bayesian model consisting of a set of [[independent identically distributed|i.i.d.]] observations from a [[Gaussian distribution]], with unknown [[mean]] and [[variance]].<ref name = bishop>Based on Chapter 10 of ''Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning'' by [[Christopher M. Bishop]]</ref> In the following, we work through this model in great detail to illustrate the workings of the variational Bayes method.\n\nFor mathematical convenience, in the following example we work in terms of the [[precision (statistics)|precision]] \u2014 i.e. the reciprocal of the variance (or in a multivariate Gaussian, the inverse of the [[covariance matrix]]) \u2014 rather than the variance itself.  (From a theoretical standpoint, precision and variance are equivalent since there is a [[one-to-one correspondence]] between the two.)\n\n===The mathematical model===\nWe place [[conjugate prior]] distributions on the unknown mean <math>\\mu</math> and precision <math>\\tau</math>, i.e. the mean also follows a Gaussian distribution while the precision follows a [[gamma distribution]].

This naturally suggests an [[expectation-maximization algorithm|EM]]-like algorithm:\n\n#Compute <math>\\sum_{n=1}^N x_n</math> and <math>\\sum_{n=1}^N x_n^2.</math> Use these values to compute <math>\\mu_N</math> and <math>a_N.</math>\n#Initialize <math>\\lambda_N</math> to some arbitrary value.\n#Use the current value of <math>\\lambda_N,</math> along with the known values of the other parameters, to compute <math>b_N</math>.\n#Use the current value of <math>b_N,</math> along with the known values of the other parameters, to compute <math>\\lambda_N</math>.\n#Repeat the last two steps until convergence (i.e. until neither value has changed more than some small amount).\n\nWe then have values for the hyperparameters of the approximating distributions of the posterior parameters, which we can use to compute any properties we want of the posterior \u2014 e.g. its mean and variance, a 95% highest-density region (the smallest interval that includes 95% of the total probability), etc.\n\nIt can be shown that this algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum.\n\nNote also that the posterior distributions have the same form as the corresponding prior distributions.  We did ''not'' assume this; the only assumption we made was that the distributions factorize, and the form of the distributions followed naturally.  It turns out (see below) that the fact that the posterior distributions have the same form as the prior distributions is not a coincidence, but a general result whenever the prior distributions are members of the [[exponential family]], which is the case for most of the standard distributions.\n\n==Further discussion==\n\n===Step-by-step recipe===\nThe above example shows the method by which the variational-Bayesian approximation to a [[posterior probability]] density in a given [[Bayesian network]] is derived:\n#Describe the network with a [[graphical model]], identifying the observed variables (data) <math>\\mathbf{X}</math> and unobserved variables ([[parameter]]s <math>\\boldsymbol\\Theta</math> and [[latent variable]]s <math>\\mathbf{Z}</math>) and their [[conditional probability distribution]]s.  Variational Bayes will then construct an approximation to the posterior probability <math>p(\\mathbf{Z},\\boldsymbol\\Theta\\mid\\mathbf{X})</math>.  The approximation has the basic property that it is a factorized distribution, i.e. a product of two or more [[statistical independence|independent]] distributions over disjoint subsets of the unobserved variables.\n#Partition the unobserved variables into two or more subsets, over which the independent factors will be derived.  There is no universal procedure for doing this; creating too many subsets yields a poor approximation, while creating too few makes the entire variational Bayes procedure intractable.  Typically, the first split is to separate the parameters and latent variables; often, this is enough by itself to produce a tractable result.  Assume that the partitions are called <math>\\mathbf{Z}_1,\\ldots,\\mathbf{Z}_M</math>.\n#For a given partition <math>\\mathbf{Z}_j</math>, write down the formula for the best approximating distribution <math>q_j^{*}(\\mathbf{Z}_j\\mid \\mathbf{X})</math> using the basic equation <math>\\ln q_j^{*}(\\mathbf{Z}_j\\mid \\mathbf{X}) = \\operatorname{E}_{i \\neq j} [\\ln p(\\mathbf{Z}, \\mathbf{X})] + \\text{constant}</math> .\n#Fill in the formula for the [[joint probability distribution]] using the graphical model.  Any component conditional distributions that don't involve any of the variables in <math>\\mathbf{Z}_j</math> can be ignored; they will be folded into the constant term.\n#Simplify the formula and apply the expectation operator, following the above example.  Ideally, this should simplify into expectations of basic functions of variables not in <math>\\mathbf{Z}_j</math> (e.g. first or second raw [[moment (mathematics)|moment]]s, expectation of a logarithm, etc.).  In order for the variational Bayes procedure to work well, these expectations should generally be expressible analytically as functions of the parameters and/or [[hyperparameter]]s of the distributions of these variables.  In all cases, these expectation terms are constants with respect to the variables in the current partition.\n#The functional form of the formula with respect to the variables in the current partition indicates the type of distribution.  In particular, exponentiating the formula generates the [[probability density function]] (PDF) of the distribution (or at least, something proportional to it, with unknown [[normalization constant]]).  In order for the overall method to be tractable, it should be possible to recognize the functional form as belonging to a known distribution.  Significant mathematical manipulation may be required to convert the formula into a form that matches the PDF of a known distribution.  When this can be done, the normalization constant can be reinstated by definition, and equations for the parameters of the known distribution can be derived by extracting the appropriate parts of the formula.\n#When all expectations can be replaced analytically with functions of variables not in the current partition, and the PDF put into a form that allows identification with a known distribution, the result is a set of equations expressing the values of the optimum parameters as functions of the parameters of variables in other partitions.\n#When this procedure can be applied to all partitions, the result is a set of mutually linked equations specifying the optimum values of all parameters.\n#An [[expectation maximization]] (EM) type procedure is then applied, picking an initial value for each parameter and the iterating through a series of steps, where at each step we cycle through the equations, updating each parameter in turn.  This is guaranteed to converge.\n\n===Most important points===\nDue to all of the mathematical manipulations involved, it is easy to lose track of the big picture.  The important things are:\n#The idea of variational Bayes is to construct an analytical approximation to the [[posterior probability]] of the set of unobserved variables (parameters and latent variables), given the data.  This means that the form of the solution is similar to other [[Bayesian inference]] methods, such as [[Gibbs sampling]] \u2014 i.e. a distribution that seeks to describe everything that is known about the variables.  As in other Bayesian methods \u2014 but unlike e.g. in [[expectation maximization]] (EM) or other [[maximum likelihood]] methods \u2014 both types of unobserved variables (i.e. parameters and latent variables) are treated the same, i.e. as [[random variable]]s.  Estimates for the variables can then be derived in the standard Bayesian ways, e.g. calculating the mean of the distribution to get a single point estimate or deriving a [[credible interval]], highest density region, etc.\n#\"Analytical approximation\" means that a formula can be written down for the posterior distribution.  The formula generally consists of a product of well-known probability distributions, each of which ''factorizes'' over a set of unobserved variables (i.e. it is [[conditionally independent]] of the other variables, given the observed data).  This formula is not the true posterior distribution, but an approximation to it; in particular, it will generally agree fairly closely in the lowest [[moment (mathematics)|moment]]s of the unobserved variables, e.g. the [[mean]] and [[variance]].\n#The result of all of the mathematical manipulations is (1) the identity of the probability distributions making up the factors, and (2) mutually dependent formulas for the parameters of these distributions.  The actual values of these parameters are computed numerically, through an alternating iterative procedure much like EM.\n\n===Compared with expectation maximization (EM)===\nVariational Bayes (VB) is often compared with [[expectation maximization]] (EM).  The actual numerical procedure is quite similar, in that both are alternating iterative procedures that successively converge on optimum parameter values.  The initial steps to derive the respective procedures are also vaguely similar, both starting out with formulas for probability densities and both involving significant amounts of mathematical manipulations.\n\nHowever, there are a number of differences.  Most important is ''what'' is being computed.\n*EM computes point estimates of posterior distribution of those random variables that can be categorized as \"parameters\", but only estimates of the actual posterior distributions of the latent variables (at least in \"soft EM\", and often only when the latent variables are discrete).  The point estimates computed are the [[mode (statistics)|mode]]s of these parameters; no other information is available.\n*VB, on the other hand, computes estimates of the actual posterior distribution of all variables, both parameters and latent variables.  When point estimates need to be derived, generally the [[mean]] is used rather than the mode, as is normal in Bayesian inference.  Concomitant with this, the parameters computed in VB do ''not'' have the same significance as those in EM.  EM computes optimum values of the parameters of the Bayes network itself.  VB computes optimum values of the parameters of the distributions used to approximate the parameters and latent variables of the Bayes network.  For example, a typical Gaussian [[mixture model]] will have parameters for the mean and variance of each of the mixture components.  EM would directly estimate optimum values for these parameters.  VB, however, would first fit a distribution to these parameters \u2014 typically in the form of a [[prior distribution]], e.g. a [[normal-scaled inverse gamma distribution]] \u2014 and would then compute values for the parameters of this prior distribution, i.e. essentially [[hyperparameters]].  In this case, VB would compute optimum estimates of the four parameters of the normal-scaled inverse gamma distribution that describes the joint distribution of the mean and variance of the component.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==A more complex example==\n{{Dispute about|Equation correctness| date=April 2018}}\n[[File:bayesian-gaussian-mixture-vb.svg|right|300px|thumb|Bayesian Gaussian mixture model using [[plate notation]].

Now that we have determined the distributions over which these expectations are taken, we can derive formulas for them:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\operatorname{E}_{\\mathbf{\\mu}_k,\\mathbf{\\Lambda}_k}  [(\\mathbf{x}_n - \\mathbf{\\mu}_k)^{\\rm T} \\mathbf{\\Lambda}_k (\\mathbf{x}_n - \\mathbf{\\mu}_k)] & = D\\beta_k^{-1} + \\nu_k (\\mathbf{x}_n - \\mathbf{m}_k)^{\\rm T} \\mathbf{W}_k (\\mathbf{x}_n - \\mathbf{m}_k) \\\\\n\\ln {\\widetilde{\\Lambda}}_k &\\equiv \\operatorname{E}[\\ln |\\mathbf{\\Lambda}_k|] = \\sum_{i=1}^D \\psi \\left(\\frac{\\nu_k + 1 - i}{2}\\right) + D \\ln 2 + \\ln |\\mathbf{W}_k| \\\\\n\\ln {\\widetilde{\\pi}}_k &\\equiv \\operatorname{E}\\left[\\ln |\\pi_k|\\right] = \\psi(\\alpha_k) - \\psi\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^K \\alpha_i\\right)\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThese results lead to\n\n:<math>r_{nk} \\propto {\\widetilde{\\pi}}_k {\\widetilde{\\Lambda}}_k^{1/2} \\exp \\left\\{ - \\frac{D}{2 \\beta_k} - \\frac{\\nu_k}{2} (\\mathbf{x}_n - \\mathbf{m}_k)^{\\rm T} \\mathbf{W}_k (\\mathbf{x}_n - \\mathbf{m}_k) \\right\\}</math>\n\nThese can be converted from proportional to absolute values by normalizing over <math>k</math> so that the corresponding values sum to 1.\n\nNote that:\n\n#The update equations for the parameters <math>\\beta_k</math>, <math>\\mathbf{m}_k</math>, <math>\\mathbf{W}_k</math> and <math>\\nu_k</math> of the variables <math>\\mathbf{\\mu}_k</math> and <math>\\mathbf{\\Lambda}_k</math> depend on the statistics <math>N_k</math>, <math>{\\bar{\\mathbf{x}}}_k</math>, and <math>\\mathbf{S}_k</math>, and these statistics in turn depend on <math>r_{nk}</math>.\n#The update equations for the parameters <math>\\alpha_{1 \\dots K}</math> of the variable <math>\\mathbf{\\pi}</math> depend on the statistic <math>N_k</math>, which depends in turn on <math>r_{nk}</math>.\n#The update equation for <math>r_{nk}</math> has a direct circular dependence on <math>\\beta_k</math>, <math>\\mathbf{m}_k</math>, <math>\\mathbf{W}_k</math> and <math>\\nu_k</math> as well as an indirect circular dependence on <math>\\mathbf{W}_k</math>, <math>\\nu_k</math> and <math>\\alpha_{1 \\dots K}</math> through <math>{\\widetilde{\\pi}}_k</math> and <math>{\\widetilde{\\Lambda}}_k</math>.\n\nThis suggests an iterative procedure that alternates between two steps:\n\n#An E-step that computes the value of <math>r_{nk}</math> using the current values of all the other parameters.\n#An M-step that uses the new value of <math>r_{nk}</math> to compute new values of all the other parameters.\n\nNote that these steps correspond closely with the standard EM algorithm to derive a [[maximum likelihood]] or [[maximum a posteriori]] (MAP) solution for the parameters of a [[Gaussian mixture model]].  The responsibilities <math>r_{nk}</math> in the E step correspond closely to the [[posterior probability|posterior probabilities]] of the latent variables given the data, i.e. <math>p(\\mathbf{Z}\\mid \\mathbf{X})</math>; the computation of the statistics <math>N_k</math>, <math>{\\bar{\\mathbf{x}}}_k</math>, and <math>\\mathbf{S}_k</math> corresponds closely to the computation of corresponding \"soft-count\" statistics over the data; and the use of those statistics to compute new values of the parameters corresponds closely to the use of soft counts to compute new parameter values in normal EM over a Gaussian mixture model.\n\n==Exponential-family distributions==\nNote that in the previous example, once the distribution over unobserved variables was assumed to factorize into distributions over the \"parameters\" and distributions over the \"latent data\", the derived \"best\" distribution for each variable was in the same family as the corresponding prior distribution over the variable.  This is a general result that holds true for all prior distributions derived from the [[exponential family]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Variational message passing]]: a modular algorithm for variational Bayesian inference.\n* [[Expectation-maximization algorithm]]: a related approach which corresponds to a special case of variational Bayesian inference.\n* [[Generalized filtering]]: a variational filtering scheme for nonlinear state space models.\n* [[Calculus of variations]]: the field of mathematical analysis that deals with maximizing or minimizing functionals.\n* [[Maximum entropy discrimination]]: This is a variational inference framework that allows for introducing and accounting for additional large-margin constraints <ref> Sotirios P.
