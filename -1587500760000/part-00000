The term is mostly applied to machines that use water as opposed to [[dry cleaning]] (which uses alternative cleaning fluids and is performed by specialist businesses) or [[ultrasonic cleaner]]s. The user adds [[laundry detergent]], which is sold in liquid or powder form, to the wash water.\n\n==History==\n===Washing by hand===\n{{Main|Laundry#History}}\n[[File:Rhof-histWaschmaschine.ogv|thumb|Irreler Bauerntradition shows an early Miele washing machine at the [[Roscheider Hof Open Air Museum]]]]\n\nLaundering by hand involves soaking, beating, scrubbing, and rinsing dirty textiles. Before [[indoor plumbing]], the [[maids]], [[washerwoman]] (laundress), or [[housewife]] also had to carry all the water used for washing, boiling, and rinsing the laundry; according to an 1886 calculation, some women in the United States fetched water eight to ten times every day from a [[pump]], [[Water well|well]], or spring for these purposes.<ref name=digital>{{cite web | publisher = Digital History | title = Housework in Late 19th Century America | first = Steven | last = Mintz |url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/topic_display.cfm?tcid=93 | accessdate = 13 September 2012}}</ref> Water for the laundry would be hand carried, heated on a fire for washing, then poured into the tub. That made the warm soapy water precious; it would be reused, first to wash the least soiled clothing, then to wash progressively dirtier laundry.\n\nRemoval of soap and water from the clothing after washing was a separate process. First, soap would be rinsed out with clear water. After rinsing, the soaking wet clothing would be formed into a roll and twisted by hand to extract water. The entire process often occupied an entire day of hard work, plus drying and ironing.\n\nEven today, worldwide, probably more people have their clothes handwashed than with a washing machine.{{cn|date=April 2020}} They may use a central facility such as a [[Dhobi Ghat|dhobi ghat]], a simple bucket or bowl, or a local stream.\n\n[[File:Miele 100.jpg|thumb|upright|1930 electric wringer/ mangle washing machine.]]\n[[File:OldMiele2.jpg|thumb|Early [[Miele]] washing machine with a [[Mangle (machine)|mangle]] (probably 1930).]]\n\n===Early machines===\n[[File:Washing machine.jpg|thumb|19th-century Metropolitan washing machine]]\n[[File:Waschmaschine Historisch.jpg|thumb|upright|A vintage German model]]\n\nThe first English [[patent]] \nunder the category of Washing machines was issued in 1691.<ref>''Mothers and Daughters of Invention: Notes for a Revised History of Technology'', Autumn Stanley, [[Rutgers University]] Press, 1995, p. 301</ref>  A drawing of an early washing machine appeared in the January 1752 issue of ''The Gentleman's Magazine'', a British publication.

Basically, these early design patents consisted of a drum washer that was hand-cranked to make the wooden drums rotate.  While the technology was simple enough, it was a milestone in the history of washing machines, as it introduced the idea of \"powered\" washing drums.  As metal drums started to replace the traditional wooden drums, it allowed for the drum to turn above an open fire or an enclosed fire chamber, raising the water temperature for more effective washes.\n\nIt would not be until the 19th century when steam power would be used in washing machine designs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2896500105.html |title=Washing Machine Facts, information, pictures &#124; Encyclopedia.com articles about Washing Machine |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-01}}</ref>\n\nIn 1862, a patented \"compound rotary washing machine, with rollers for wringing or mangling\"  by Richard Lansdale of Pendleton, Manchester, was shown at the [[1862 International Exhibition|1862 London Exhibition]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/1862_London_Exhibition:_Catalogue:_Class_VIII.:_Richard_Lansdale |title=1862 London Exhibition: Catalogue: Class VIII.: Richard Lansdale |publisher=GracesGuide.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-06-19}}</ref>\n\nThe first United States Patent titled \"Clothes Washing\" was granted to Nathaniel Briggs of [[New Hampshire]] in 1797.

The mechanism was now enclosed within a cabinet, and more attention was paid to electrical and mechanical safety. [[Spin dryer]]s were introduced to replace the dangerous power mangle/wringers of the day.\n\nBy 1940, 60% of the 25,000,000 wired homes in the United States had an electric washing machine.

In appearance and mechanical detail, this first machine was not unlike the front loading automatic washers produced today. \n\nAlthough it included many of today's basic features, the machine lacked any drum suspension and therefore had to be anchored to the floor to prevent \"walking\". Because of the components required, the machine was also very expensive. For instance, the Bendix Home Laundry Service Manual (published November 1, 1946) shows that the drum speed change was facilitated by a 2-speed gearbox built to a heavy duty standard (not unlike a car automatic gearbox, albeit at a smaller size). The timer was also probably fairly costly, because miniature electric motors were expensive to produce.\n\nEarly automatic washing machines were usually connected to a water supply via temporary slip-on connectors to sink taps. Later, permanent connections to both the hot and cold water supplies became the norm, as dedicated laundry water hookups became common. Most modern front-loading European machines now only have a cold water connection (called \"cold fill\") and rely completely on internal electric heaters to raise the water temperature.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trocknerland.com/waermepumpentrockner |title=Test & Vergleich |accessdate=March 17, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305225117/http://www.trocknerland.com/waermepumpentrockner/ |archivedate=March 5, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nMany of the early automatic machines had coin-in-the-slot facilities and were installed in the basement laundry rooms of apartment houses.\n\n===World War II and after=== \n{{Globalize |date=September 2016|reason=This is not the \"Washing machine in the US\" article!}}\n[[File:Bendix washing machine. Melbourne Museum.jpg|thumb|A classic Bendix washing machine]]\n[[File:Waschvollautomat Constructa 1950er.jpg|thumb|upright|A 1950s model Constructa]]\n\nAfter the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], US domestic washer production was suspended for the duration of [[World War II]] in favor of manufacturing war [[materiel|material]]. However, numerous US appliance manufacturers were given permission to undertake the research and development of washers during the war years. Many took the opportunity to develop automatic machines, realizing that these represented the future for the industry.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://gogd.tjs-labs.com/show-picture?id=1129064419 | author=A. S. Campbell Co. | title = Your Next Washing Machine (or is it?) |date=1942-12-28 |magazine=Time |page=88 | accessdate = 13 September 2012}}</ref>\n\nA large number of US manufacturers introduced competing automatic machines (mainly of the top-loading type) in the late 1940s and early 1950s. [[General Electric]] also introduced its first top loading automatic model in 1947. This machine had many of the features that are incorporated into modern machines. Another early form of automatic washing machine manufactured by [[The Hoover Company]] used cartridges to program different wash cycles. This system, called the \"Keymatic\", used plastic cartridges with key-like slots and ridges around the edges. The cartridge was inserted into a slot on the machine and a mechanical reader operated the machine accordingly.\n\nSeveral manufacturers produced semi-automatic machines, requiring the user to intervene at one or two points in the wash cycle. A common semi-automatic type (available from Hoover in the UK until at least the 1970s) included two tubs: one with an agitator or impeller for washing, plus another smaller tub for water extraction or centrifugal rinsing.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nSince their introduction, automatic washing machines have relied on [[timer|electromechanical timer]]s to sequence the washing and extraction process. Electromechanical timers consist of a series of [[cam]]s on a common shaft driven by a small electric motor via a [[reduction gearbox]]. At the appropriate time in the wash cycle, each cam actuates a switch to engage or disengage a particular part of the machinery (for example, the drain pump motor). One of the first was invented in 1957 by [[Winston L. Shelton]] and Gresham N. Jennings, then both [[General Electric]] engineers. The device was granted US Patent 2870278.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.google.la/patents/US2870278 | title = Timing mechanism for conducting a selected one of a plurality of sequences of operation | accessdate = 2 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn the early electromechanical timers, the motor ran at a constant speed throughout the wash cycle, although it was possible for the user to truncate parts of the program by manually advancing the control dial. However, by the 1950s demand for greater flexibility in the wash cycle led to the introduction of more sophisticated electrical timers to supplement the electromechanical timer. These newer timers enabled greater variation in functions such as the wash time. With this arrangement, the electric timer motor is periodically switched off to permit the clothing to soak, and is only re-energized just prior to a micro-switch being engaged or disengaged for the next stage of the process.  Fully electronic timers did not become widespread until decades later.\n\nDespite the high cost of automatic washers, manufacturers had difficulty in meeting the demand.[https://www.clashofclansapk.com/clash-of-magic/] Although there were material shortages during the [[Korean War]], by 1953 automatic washing machine sales in the US exceeded those of wringer-type electric machines.\n\nIn the UK and in most of Europe, electric washing machines did not become popular until the 1950s. This was largely because of the economic impact of World War II on the consumer market, which did not properly recover until the late 1950s. The early electric washers were single-tub, wringer-type machines, as fully automatic washing machines were extremely expensive. During the 1960s, twin tub machines briefly became very popular, helped by the low price of the [[Rolls Razor]] washers. Some machines had the ability to pump used wash water into a separate tub for temporary storage, and to later pump it back for re-use. This was done not to save water or soap, but because heated water was expensive and time-consuming to produce. Automatic washing machines did not become dominant in the UK until well into the 1970s and by then were almost exclusively of the front-loader design.\n\nIn early automatic washing machines, any changes in impeller/drum speed were achieved by mechanical means or by a [[rheostat]] on the motor power supply. However, since the 1970s electronic control of motor speed has become a common feature on the more expensive models.\n\n===Modern washers===\n<!-- If you have doubts about something, do not delete text, instead, add the citation needed template or go search for citations! -->\nOver time manufacturers of automatic washers have gone to great lengths to reduce cost. For instance, expensive gearboxes are no longer required, since motor speed can be controlled electronically. Some models can be controlled via WiFi, and have angled drums to facilitate loading. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://panasonic.jp/wash/products/na_vg2400.html|title=\u306a\u306a\u3081\u30c9\u30e9\u30e0\u6d17\u6fef\u4e7e\u71e5\u6a5f NA-VG2400L/R &#124; \u5546\u54c1\u4e00\u89a7 &#124; \u6d17\u6fef\u6a5f\uff0f\u8863\u985e\u4e7e\u71e5\u6a5f &#124; Panasonic|website=panasonic.jp}}</ref>\n\nEven on some expensive washers, the outer drum of front loading machines is often (but not always) made of plastic (it can also be made out of metal but this is expensive). This makes [[Planned obsolescence|changing the main bearings difficult]], as the plastic drum usually cannot be separated into two halves to enable the inner drum to be removed to gain access to the bearing.\n\nSome manufacturers have taken steps to reduce vibration emanating from their washers, by means of reducing or controlling motor speeds, using hydraulic suspensions instead of spring suspensions, and having freely moving steel balls (Samsung VRT) or liquid contained inside a ring mounted on both the front and back sides of the drum in order to counter the weight of the clothes and reduce vibration.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hitachi-hk.com.hk/en/products/index_id_2015.html|title=Home Appliances - Washer - Front Loading Drum Type - BD-W90XWV|website=www.hitachi-hk.com.hk}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hmsi-hitachi.co.th/eng/|title=Hitachi Modern Sales Thailand|website=hmsi-hitachi.co.th}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hmsi-hitachi.co.th/eng/|title=Hitachi Modern Sales Thailand|website=hmsi-hitachi.co.th}}</ref>\n\nSome machines, since 1998<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lg.com/levant_en/press-release/direct-drive-motor-featured-in-lgs-washing-machines-earns-prestigious-vde-certification|title=Drive Motor In LG'S Washing Machines |website=LG Levant |language=en|access-date=2018-12-16}}</ref> now use a direct drive motor, a low aspect ratio device, where the stator assembly is attached to the rear of the outer drum, whilst the co-axial rotor is mounted on the shaft of the inner drum.<ref>{{cite patent|title=Direct drive motor in washing machine|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US7750531B2/en|country=US|number=7750531B2|issue-date=2005-11-08|access-date=2018-12-16}}</ref> Direct drive eliminates the need for a pulley, belt and belt tensioner.

The hexagonal tub spins like a front-loading machine, using only about one third as much water as conventional top-loaders.  This factor has led to an [[Energy Star]] rating for its high efficiency. This type of horizontal axis washer and dryer (with a circular drum) is often used in Europe, where space is limited, as they can be as thin as 40&nbsp;cm in width.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.candy.com.ar/lavado/lavado-carga-superior/evo-plaisir-cyt-861d|title=Candy - Evo Plaisir CYT 861D|website=www.candy.com.ar}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, [[New Zealand]]-based company [[Fisher & Paykel]] introduced its SmartDrive washing machine line in the US. This washing machine uses a computer-controlled system to determine certain factors such as load size and automatically adjusts the wash cycle to match. It also used a mixed system of washing, first with the \"Eco-Active\" wash, using a low level of recirculated water being sprayed on the load followed by a more traditional style wash. The SmartDrive also included direct drive [[brushless DC electric motor]], which simplified the bowl and agitator drive by doing away with the need for a gearbox system.\n\nIn 2000, the British [[inventor]] [[James Dyson]] launched the CR01 [[ContraRotator]], a type of washing machine with two cylinders rotating in opposite directions. It was claimed that this design reduced the wash time and produced cleaner washing than a single cylinder machine. In 2004 there was the launch of the CR02, which was the first washing machine to gain the British Allergy Foundation Seal of Approval. However, neither of the ContraRotator machines are now in production as they were too expensive to manufacture. They were discontinued in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dyson|first=James|title=Inside Dyson: CR01|url=http://content.dyson.co.uk/insideDyson/article.asp?aID=cr01&disType=nonFlash&dir=&cp=&hf=1&js=1|publisher=dyson.co.uk|accessdate=13 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523024545/http://content.dyson.co.uk/insideDyson/article.asp?aID=cr01&disType=nonFlash&dir=&cp=&hf=1&js=1|archive-date=23 May 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-12-18/james-dyson-on-killing-the-contrarotator-his-educative-failure|title=James Dyson on Killing the Contrarotator, His 'Educative Failure'|date=2012-12-18|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-02-19|language=en}}</ref> It is patented under [https://patents.google.com/patent/US7750531B2/en U.S. Patent US7750531B2], [https://patents.google.com/patent/US6311527 U.S. Patent US6311527], [https://patents.google.com/patent/US20010023513 U.S. Patent US20010023513], [https://patents.google.com/patent/US6311527B1/en?q=D06F21%2f04 U.S. Patent US6311527B1], [https://patents.google.com/patent/USD450164 U.S. Patent USD450164].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.international.dyson.com:80/tech/contrarotator/patents.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041112141138/http://www.international.dyson.com/tech/contrarotator/patents.asp|url-status=dead|archive-date=2004-11-12|title=Dyson - Patent and design applications|date=2004-11-12|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, [[Whirlpool Corporation]] introduced the Calypso, the first vertical-axis high efficiency washing machine to be top-loading.

(California)]]\n[[File:Toroidal coord.png|thumb|In a top-loading washer, water circulates primarily along the poloidal axis during the wash cycle, as indicated by the red arrow in this illustration of a [[torus]].]]\n\nThe top loading, vertical axis cloth washer, is the dominant design in the United States and Canada. This design places the clothes in a vertically mounted perforated basket that is contained within a water-retaining tub, with a finned water-pumping [[agitator (device)|agitator]] in the center of the bottom of the basket. Clothes are loaded through the top of the machine, which is usually but not always covered with a hinged door.\n\nDuring the wash cycle, the outer tub is filled with water sufficient to fully immerse and suspend the clothing freely in the basket. The movement of the agitator pushes water outward between the paddles towards the edge of the tub. The water then moves outward, up the sides of the basket, towards the center, and then down towards the agitator to repeat the process, in a circulation pattern similar to the shape of a [[torus]]. The agitator direction is periodically reversed, because continuous motion in one direction would just lead to the water spinning around the basket with the agitator rather than the water being pumped in the torus-shaped motion. Some washers supplement the water-pumping action of the agitator with a large rotating screw on the shaft above the agitator, to help move water downwards in the center of the basket.\n\nSince the agitator and the drum are separate and distinct in a top-loading washing machine, the mechanism of a top-loader is inherently more complicated than a front-loading machine. Manufacturers have devised several ways to control the motion of the agitator during wash and rinse separately from the high speed rotation of the drum required for the spin cycle.\n\nWhile a top-loading washing machine could use a [[universal motor]] or DC brushless motor, it is conventional for top-loading washing machines to use more expensive, heavy, and more electrically efficient and reliable [[induction motor]]s. The action of a front-loading washing machine is better suited to a motor capable of reversing direction with every reversal of the wash basket; a universal motor is noisier, less efficient, doesn't last as long, but is better suited to the task of reversing direction every few seconds.\n\nAn alternative to the oscillating agitator design is the impeller type washtub pioneered by [[The Hoover Company|Hoover]] on its long running ''Hoovermatic'' series of top loading machines.  Here, an [[impeller]] (trademarked by Hoover as a \"Pulsator\") mounted on the side of the tub spins in a constant direction, and creates a fast moving current of water in the tub which drags the clothes through the water along a toroidal path. The impeller design has the advantage of its mechanical simplicity - a single speed motor with belt drive is all that is required to drive the Pulsator with no need for gearboxes or complex electrical controls, but has the disadvantage of lower load capacity in relation to tub size. Hoovermatic machines were made mostly in twin tub format for the European market - (where they competed with [[Hotpoint]]'s ''Supermatic'' line which used the oscillating agitator design) until the early 1990s.  Some industrial garment testing machines still use the Hoover wash action.\n\nThe many different ways different manufacturers have solved the same problem over the years is a good example of many different ways to solve the same [[engineering]] problem with different goals, different manufacturing capabilities and expertise, and different [[patent]] encumbrances.\n\n====Reversible motor====\nIn most current top-loading washers, if the motor spins in one direction, the [[Transmission (mechanics)|gearbox]] drives the agitator; if the motor spins the other way, the gearbox locks the agitator and spins the basket and agitator together. Similarly, if the pump motor rotates one way it recirculates the sudsy water; in the other direction it pumps water from the machine during the spin cycle. Mechanically, this system is very simple.\n\n====Mode-changing transmission====\nIn some top loaders, the motor runs only in one direction. During agitation, the transmission converts the rotation into the alternating motion driving the agitator. During the spin cycle, the timer turns on a [[solenoid]] which engages a [[clutch]] locking the motor's rotation to the wash basket, providing a spin cycle. General Electric's very popular line of Filter-Flo (seen to the right) used a variant of this design where the motor reversed only to pump water out of the machine. The same clutch which allows the heavy tub full of wet clothes to \"slip\" as it comes up to the motor's speed, is also allowed to \"slip\" during agitation to engage a Gentle Cycle for delicate clothes.\n\nWhirlpool (Kenmore) created a popular design demonstrating the complex mechanisms which could be used to produce different motions from a single motor with the so-called \"[[wig wag (washing machines)|wig wag]]\" mechanism, which was used for decades until modern controls rendered it obsolete. In the Whirlpool mechanism, a protruding moving piece oscillates in time with the agitation motion. Two solenoids are mounted to this protruding moving piece, with wires attaching them to the timer. During the cycle, the motor operates continuously, and the solenoids on the \"wig wag\" engage agitation or spin. Despite the wires controlling the solenoids being subject to abrasion and broken connections due to their constant motion and the solenoids operating in a damp environment where corrosion could damage them, these machines were surprisingly reliable.\n\n====Reversible motor with mode-changing transmission====\n\nSome top-loaders, especially compact apartment-sized washers, use a hybrid mechanism. The motor reverses direction every few seconds, often with a pause between direction changes, to perform the agitation. Spin cycle is accomplished by engaging a clutch in the transmission. A separate motorized pump is generally used to drain this style of machine. These machines could easily be implemented with [[universal motor]]s or more modern DC [[brushless motors]], but older ones tend to use a capacitor-start [[induction motor]] with a pause between reversals of agitation.\n\n====Top-load advantages====\n\nThe top-loader's spin cycle between washing and rinsing allows an extremely simple passive [[fabric softener]] dispenser, which operates through [[centrifugal force]] and [[Gravitation|gravity]]. Fabric softener, vinegar, or any other liquid rinse agent, is placed in a cup at the top of the agitator. It \"rides along\" during the wash cycle. When the spin cycle is engaged, the fabric softener is pulled up by a tapered cup and centrifugal force, where it collects in the top of the spinning agitator. Once the spin cycle is completed, centrifugal force no longer suspends the fabric softener and it falls through the center of the agitator to join the rinse water coming into the tub. The same objective must be accomplished by a [[solenoid valve]] or a pump, and associated timer controls and wiring, on a front loader.\n\nA lint trap can also be built into the center of the agitator,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.consul.com.br/produto/lavadora-consul-facilite-9-kg/|title=M\u00e1quina de Lavar Consul 9kg Turbo Lavagem|work=Consul|access-date=2018-02-19|language=pt-BR}}</ref> or on the drum's walls,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://panasonic.jp/wash/product/fa_fw_jfa/auto_cleaning.html|title=FW/FD/FA/JFA\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u7279\u9577\uff1a\u81ea\u52d5\u69fd\u6d17\u6d44/\u30ab\u30d3\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u30bf\u30f3\u30af/\u300c\u30ca\u30ce\u30a4\u30fc\u300d\u69fd\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3 {{!}} \u6d17\u6fef\u6a5f\uff0f\u8863\u985e\u4e7e\u71e5\u6a5f {{!}} Panasonic|website=panasonic.jp|language=ja|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lg.com/in/support/video-tutorials/CT20150045-1394432728524-maintenance|title=LG Video Tutorials: Video: Magic/Lint Filter Cleaning ( Top loading) {{!}} LG India|website=www.lg.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.samsung.com/in/support/skp/faq/137356|title=What is the function of Magic Filter in a Samsung Washing Machine?|website=www.samsung.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.samsung.com/za/support/skp/faq/1139253|title=What is Magic Filter in Samsung Washing Machine ?|website=www.samsung.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.samsung.com/in/support/skp/faq/1138351|title=How to clean the Magic filter in Samsung Washing Machine ?|website=www.samsung.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref>  passively collecting lint from water forced through the agitator. Front-loaders tend to require separate pumps and plumbing to provide lint filters which are often mounted behind covers on the bottom of the machine.\n\nAnother advantage to the top loading design is the reliance on gravity to contain the water, rather than potentially trouble-prone or short-lived front door seals. Top loaders may require less periodic maintenance, since there is no need to clean a door seal or bellows, although a plastic tub may still require a periodic \"maintenance wash\" cycle (described below).\n\nAs with front-loading washers, clothing should not be packed tightly into a top-loading washer. Although wet fabric usually fits into a smaller space than dry fabric, a dense wad of fabric can restrict water circulation, resulting in poor soap distribution and incomplete rinsing. Extremely overloaded top-loading washers can either jam the motion of the agitator, overloading or damaging the motor or gearbox, burning drive belts, or tearing fabrics - many Whirlpool/Kenmore machines even have a mechanical \"fuse\" designed to break before the expensive motor is damaged. Extreme overloading can also push fabrics into the small gap between the underside of the agitator and the bottom of the wash basket, resulting in fabrics wrapped around the agitator shaft, possibly requiring agitator removal to unjam.\n\nSome top-loading machines use mechanisms very similar to front-loading drum machines, and are [[#Variant and hybrid designs|described below]].\n\n===Front-loading===\n[[File:WashingMachine, manufactured by ArcticRomania.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Arctic S.A.|Arctic]] BE1200A+ is a front loading budget model sold in 2008 with {{convert|6|kg|adj=on}} load, LCD indicator, 1200 RPM]]\n[[File:Drum of a washing machine (Bosch Maxx WFO 2440).jpg|thumb|Modern drum of front-loading washing machine (Bosch Maxx WFO 2440)]]\nThe front-loading or horizontal-axis clothes washer is the dominant design in Europe. In the U.S. and elsewhere, most \"high-end\" washing machines are of this type. In addition, most commercial and industrial clothes washers around the world are of the horizontal-axis design.\n\nThis layout mounts the inner basket and outer tub horizontally, and loading is through a door at the front of the machine. The door often but not always contains a transparent window. Agitation is supplied by the back-and-forth rotation of the cylinder and by gravity. The clothes are lifted up by paddles on the inside wall of the drum and then dropped. This motion flexes the weave of the fabric and forces water and detergent solution through the clothes load. Because the wash action does not require the clothing be freely suspended in water, only enough water is needed to moisten the fabric. Because less water is required, front-loaders typically use less soap, and the repeated dropping and folding action of the tumbling can easily produce large amounts of foam or suds.\n\nFront-loaders control water usage through the [[surface tension]] of water, and the [[capillary action|capillary wicking action]] this creates in the fabric weave. A front-loader washer always fills to the same low water level, but a large pile of dry clothing standing in water will soak up the moisture, causing the water level to drop. The washer then refills to maintain the original water level. Because it takes time for this water absorption to occur with a motionless pile of fabric, nearly all front-loaders begin the washing process by slowly tumbling the clothing under the stream of water entering and filling the drum, to rapidly saturate the clothes with water.\n\nFront-loading washers are mechanically simple compared to top-loaders, with the main motor (a [[universal motor]] or [[variable-frequency drive]] motor) normally being connected to the drum via a grooved pulley belt and large [[pulley]] wheel, without the need for a gearbox, clutch or crank. But front-load washers suffer from their own technical problems, due to the drum lying sideways. For example, a top loading washer keeps water inside the tub merely through the force of [[gravity]] pulling down on the water, while a front-loader must tightly seal the door shut with a [[gasket]] to prevent water dripping onto the floor during the wash cycle. This access door is locked shut during the entire wash cycle, since opening the door with the machine in use could result in water gushing out onto the floor. For front-loaders without viewing windows on the door, it is possible to accidentally pinch fabric between the door and the drum, resulting in tearing and damage to the pinched clothing during tumbling and spinning.\n\nNearly all front-loader washers for the consumer market also use a folded flexible [[bellows]] assembly around the door opening, to keep clothing contained inside the basket during the tumbling wash cycle. If this bellows assembly were not used, small articles of clothing such as socks could slip out of the wash basket near the door, and fall down the narrow slot between the outer tub and basket, plugging the drain and possibly jamming rotation of the inner basket. Retrieving lost items from between the outer tub and inner basket can require complete disassembly of the front of the washer and pulling out the entire inner wash basket. Commercial and industrial front-loaders used by businesses (described below) usually do not use the bellows, and instead require all small objects to be placed in a mesh bag to prevent loss near the basket opening.\n\nThe bellows assembly around the door is a potential source of problems for the consumer front-loader. The bellows has a large number of flexible folds to permit the tub to move separately from the door during the high speed extraction cycle. On many machines, these folds can collect lint, dirt, and moisture, resulting in [[Mold (fungus)|mold]] and [[mildew]] growth, and a foul odor. Some front-loading washer operating instructions say the bellows should be wiped down monthly with a strong bleach solution, while others offer a special \"freshening\" cycle where the machine is run empty with a strong dosing of bleach.\n\nThe inherent mechanical weak spot of the front loader design is the [[cantilever]]ed mounting of the inner drum within the outer tub.  The drum bearing has to support the entire weight of the drum, the laundry, and the dynamic loads created by the sloshing of the water and of the imbalance of the load during the spin cycle.  The drum bearing eventually wears out, and usually requires extensive dismantling of the machine to replace, which often results in the machine being [[Write-off|written off]] due to the failure of a relatively inexpensive component that is labor-intensive to renew.  Some manufacturers have compounded this problem by \"overmolding\" the drum bearing into the outer tub to reduce manufacturing costs, but this makes the bearing impossible to renew without replacing the entire outer tub - which usually forces owners to scrap the entire machine - this may be viewed as an implementation of [[Planned obsolescence|built-in obsolescence]].\n\nCompared to top-loading washers, clothing can be packed more tightly in a front loader, up to the full drum volume if using a cottons wash cycle. This is because wet cloth usually fits into a smaller space than dry cloth, and front loaders are able to self-regulate the water needed to achieve correct washing and rinsing. Extreme overloading of front-loading washers pushes fabrics towards the small gap between the loading door and the front of the wash basket, potentially resulting in fabrics lost between the basket and outer tub, and in severe cases, tearing of clothing and jamming the motion of the basket.\n\n===Variant and hybrid designs===\n[[File:European top washingmachine.jpg|thumb|European top loader with horizontal axis rotating drum (2008)]]\n<!-- [[File:tvatt.jpg|thumb|European top loader with horizontal axis rotating drum (2001)]] -->\n\nThere are many variations of the two general designs. Top-loading machines in [[Asia]] use [[impeller]]s instead of agitators. Impellers are similar to agitators except that they do not have the center post extending up in the middle of the wash tub basket.\n\nSome machines which actually load from the top are otherwise much more similar to front-loading horizontal-axis drum machines. They have a drum rotating around a horizontal axis, as a front-loader, but there is no front door; instead there is a liftable lid which provides access to the drum, which has a hatch which can be latched shut. Clothes are loaded, the hatch and lid are closed, and the machine operates and spins just like a front-loader. These machines are narrower but usually taller than front-loaders, usually have a lower capacity, and are intended for use where only a narrow space is available, as is sometimes the case in Europe. They have incidental advantages: they can be loaded without bending down; they do not require a perishable rubber bellows seal; and instead of the drum having a single bearing on one side, it has a pair of symmetrical bearings, one on each side, avoiding asymmetrical bearing loading and potentially increasing life. This type of washing machine is popular in Europe, where space is limited, as a washer can be as little as 40&nbsp;cm wide, and a full washer and dryer installation can be as little as 80&nbsp;cm wide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.candy.fi/en_GB/appliances/wash-dry/top-loading-washing-machines/-/catalog/16314605/clt-272l-s|title=Candy Top loading washing machines. Comfort and efficiency - Candy|website=www.candy.fi|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref>\n\nThere are also [[combo washer dryer]] machines that combine washing cycles and a full drying cycle in the same drum, eliminating the need to transfer wet clothes from a washer to a dryer machine.  In principle, these machines are convenient for overnight cleaning (the combined cycle is considerably longer), but the effective capacity for cleaning larger batches of laundry is drastically reduced. The drying process tends to use much more energy than using two separate devices, because a combo washer dryer not only must dry the clothing, but also needs to dry out the wash chamber itself. These machines are used more in Europe, because they can be fitted into small spaces, and many can be operated without dedicated utility connections. In these machines, the washer and dryer functions often have different capacities, with the dryer usually having the lowest capacity. These machines should not be confused with a dryer on top of a washer installation, or with a laundry center, which is a one piece appliance offering a compromise between a washer-dryer combo and a full washer to the side of the dryer installation or a dryer on top of a washer installation. Laundry centers usually have the dryer on top of the washer, with the controls for both machines being on a single control panel. Often, the controls are simpler than the controls on a washer-dryer combo or a dedicated washer and dryer. Some implementations are patented under [https://patents.google.com/patent/US6343492B1/en?q=D06F37%2f04 US Patent US6343492B1] and [https://patents.google.com/patent/US6363756B1/en?q=D06F37%2f04 US Patent US 6363756B1].\n\n===Comparison===\nTrue front-loaders, and top-loading machines with horizontal-axis drum as described above, can be compared with top-loaders on a number of aspects:\n\n* Efficient cleaning: Front-loaders usually use less energy, water, and detergent compared to the best top-loaders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lanfaxlabs.com.au/washing_machines.htm | title=Laundry Products Research | date=March 2008}}</ref> High efficiency washers use 20% to 60% of the detergent, water and energy of standard\"{{explain|date=February 2020}} washers.  They usually take somewhat longer (20\u2013110 minutes) to wash a load, but are often computer controlled with additional sensors, to adapt the wash cycle to the needs of each load.  As this technology improves, the [[human interface]] will also improve, to make it easier to understand and control the many different cleaning options.\n* Water usage: Front-loaders usually use less water than top-loading residential clothes washers. Estimates are that front-loaders use from one third<ref>{{cite web|url=http://housewares.about.com/lw/Home-Garden/Home-improvement-renovation/Top-Loading-vs-Front-Loading-Washers-Which-is-Better-.htm | title=About.com}}</ref> to one half<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consumerenergycenter.org/home/appliances/washers.html | title=Consumer Energy Center}}</ref> as much water as top-loaders.\n* Spin-dry effectiveness: Front-loaders (and European horizontal axis top loaders and some front loaders) offer much higher maximum spin speeds of up to 2000&nbsp;[[revolutions per minute|RPM]], although home machines tend to be in the 1000 to 1400&nbsp;RPM range, while top-loaders (with agitators) do not exceed 1140&nbsp;RPM.  High-efficiency top-loaders with a wash plate (instead of an agitator) can spin up to 1100 RPM, as their center of gravity is lower.  Higher spin speeds, along with the diameter of the drum, determine the [[g-force]], and a higher g-force removes more residual water, making clothes dry faster. This also reduces energy consumption if clothes are dried in a [[clothes dryer]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n* Cycle length: Top-loaders have tended to have shorter cycle times, in part because their design has traditionally emphasized simplicity and speed of operation more than resource conservation.\n* Wear and abrasion: Top-loaders require an agitator or impeller mechanism to force enough water through clothes to clean them effectively, which greatly increases mechanical wear and tear on fabrics.  Front-loaders use paddles in the drum to repeatedly pick up and drop clothes into water for cleaning; this gentler action causes less wear.  The amount of clothes wear can be roughly gauged by the amount of accumulation in a clothes dryer [[lint (material)|lint]] filter, since the lint largely consists of stray fibers detached from textiles during washing and drying.\n* Difficult items: Top-loaders may have trouble cleaning large items, such as [[sleeping bag]]s or [[pillow]]s, which tend to float on top of the wash water rather than circulate within it. In addition, vigorous top-loader agitator motions may damage delicate fabrics.\n* Noise: Front-loaders tend to operate more quietly than top-loaders because the door seal helps contain noise, and because there is less of a tendency to imbalance. Top-loaders usually need a [[mechanical transmission]] (due to agitators, see above), which can generate more noise than the rubber belt or direct drive found in most front loaders.\n* Compactness: True front-loading machines may be installed underneath counter-height work surfaces. A front-loading washing machine, in a fully fitted kitchen, may even be disguised as a [[kitchen cabinet]].  These models can also be convenient in homes with limited floor area, since the clothes dryer may be installed directly above the washer (\"stacked\" configuration).\n* Water leakage: Top-loading machines are less prone to leakage, because simple [[gravity]] can reliably keep water from spilling out the loading door on top.  True front-loading machines require a flexible seal or gasket on the front door, and the front door must be locked during operation to prevent opening, lest large amounts of water spill out.  This seal may leak and require replacement.  However, many current front-loaders use so little water that they can be stopped mid-cycle for addition or removal of laundry, while keeping the water level in the horizontal tub below the door level.  Best practice installations of either type of machine will include a [[floor drain]] or an overflow catch tray with a drain connection, since neither design is immune to leakage or a [[solenoid valve]] getting stuck in the open position.\n* Maintenance and reliability: Top-loading washers are more tolerant of maintenance neglect, and may not need a regular \"freshening\" cycle to clean door seals and bellows. During the spin cycle, a top-loading tub is free to move about inside the cabinet of the machine, using only a lip around the top of the inner basket and outer tub to keep the spinning water and clothing from spraying out over the edge. Therefore, the potentially problematic door-sealing and door-locking mechanisms used by true front-loaders are not needed. On the other hand, top-loaders use mechanical gearboxes that are more vulnerable to wear than simpler front-load motor drives.\n* Accessibility and ergonomics: Front-loaders are more convenient for [[Dwarfism|very short people]] and those with [[paraplegia]], as the controls are front-mounted and the horizontal drum eliminates the need for standing or climbing. Risers, also referred to as pedestals, often with storage drawers underneath, can be used to raise the door of a true front-loader closer to the user's level.\n* Initial cost: In countries where top-loaders are popular, front-loaders tend to be more expensive to buy than top-loaders, though their lower operating costs can ultimately lead to lower [[total cost of ownership]], especially if energy, detergent, or water are expensive. On the other hand, in countries with a large front-loader user base, top-loaders are usually seen as alternatives and more expensive than basic off-brand front loaders, although without many differences in [[total cost of ownership]] apart from design-originated ones. In addition, manufacturers have tended to include more advanced features such as internal water heating, automatic dirt sensors, and high-speed emptying on front-loaders, although some of these features could be implemented on top-loaders.\n\n==Wash cycles==\n[[File:Waescheschleuder.jpg|thumb|upright|German laundry [[centrifuge]] to extract water from laundry.  The advent of automatic washing machines with spin cycles made such specialized appliances largely obsolete by the 1970s.]]\n\nThe earliest washing machines simply carried out a washing action when loaded with clothes and soap, filled with hot water, and started. Over time machines became more and more automated, first with very complex electromechanical controllers, then fully electronic controllers; users put clothes into the machine, select a suitable program via a switch, start the machine, and come back to remove clean and slightly damp clothes at the end of the cycle. The controller starts and stops many different processes including pumps and valves to fill and empty the drum with water, heating, and rotating at different speeds, with different combinations of settings for different fabrics.\n\n===Washing===\nMany front loading machines have internal electrical heating elements to heat the wash water, to near boiling if desired. The rate of chemical cleaning action of the detergent and other laundry chemicals increases greatly with temperature, in accordance with the [[Arrhenius equation]]. Washing machines with internal heaters can use special detergents formulated to release different chemical ingredients at different temperatures, allowing different type of stains and soils to be cleaned from the clothes as the wash water is heated up by the electrical heater.\n\nHowever, higher-temperature washing uses more energy, and many fabrics and elastics are damaged at higher temperatures. Temperatures exceeding {{convert|40|\u00b0C}} have the undesirable effect of inactivating the [[enzyme]]s when using [[biological detergent]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nMany machines are cold-fill, connected to cold water only, which they heat to [[operating temperature]]. Where water can be heated more cheaply or with less carbon dioxide emission than by electricity, cold-fill operation is inefficient.\n\nFront loaders need to use low-sudsing detergents because the tumbling action of the drum folds air into the clothes load that can cause over-sudsing and overflows.  However, due to efficient use of water and detergent, the sudsing issue with front-loaders can be controlled by simply using less detergent, without lessening cleaning action.\n\n===Rinsing===\nWashing machines perform several rinses after the main wash to remove most of the [[detergent]]. Modern washing machines use less [[water]] due to [[environmental concern]]s; however, this has led to the problem of poor rinsing on many washing machines on the [[Market (economics)|market]],<ref name=\"whitegoodshelp1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whitegoodshelp.co.uk/wordpress/why-cant-modern-washing-machines-rinse-properly/ |title=Why can't modern washing machines rinse properly? |publisher=Whitegoodshelp.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-02-16}}</ref> which can be a problem to people who are [[Allergy|sensitive]] to [[detergent]]s. The [[Allergy UK]] website suggests re-running the rinse cycle, or rerunning the entire wash cycle without [[detergent]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allergyuk.org/fs_handyhints.aspx |title=Allergy Tips and Advice for Household Cleaning |publisher=Allergyuk.org |date= |accessdate=2010-02-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613062143/http://allergyuk.org/fs_handyhints.aspx |archive-date=2010-06-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn response to complaints, many washing machines allow the user to select additional rinse cycles, at the [[expense]] of higher [[water usage]] and longer cycle time.\n\n===Spinning===\nHigher spin speeds, along with larger tub diameters, remove more water, leading to faster drying. On the other hand, avoid [[ironing]] can be obtained not using spin cycle in the washing machine.\n\nIf a heated [[clothes dryer|clothes-dryer]] is used after the wash and spin, energy use is reduced if more water has been removed from clothes. However, faster spinning can crease clothes more. Also, mechanical wear on bearings increases rapidly with rotational speed, reducing life. Early machines would spin at only 300 rpm and, because of lack of any mechanical suspension, would often shake and vibrate.\n\nIn 1976, most front loading washing machines spun at around 700 rpm, or less.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nSeparate spin-driers, without washing functionality, are available for specialized applications.  For example, a small high-speed [[centrifuge]] machine may be provided in [[locker room]]s of communal [[swimming pool]]s to allow wet [[swimsuit]]s to be substantially dried to a slightly damp condition after daily use.\n\n===Maintenance wash===\nMany home washing machines use a plastic, rather than metal, outer shell to contain the wash water; residue can build up on the plastic tub over time. Some manufacturers advise users to perform a regular maintenance or \"freshening\" wash to clean the inside of the washing machine of any [[Mold (fungus)|mold]], [[bacteria]], encrusted detergent, and unspecified dirt more effectively than with a normal wash.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nA maintenance wash is performed without any laundry, on the hottest wash program if there is a heater,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washerhelp.co.uk/usage_2.html |title=Washing machine usage (part 2) |publisher=Washerhelp.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-02-16}}</ref> adding substances such as [[white vinegar]], 100 grams of [[citric acid]], a detergent with bleaching properties, or a proprietary washing machine cleaner.

All else being equal, a machine of higher capacity will cost more to buy, but will be more convenient if large amounts of laundry must be cleaned. Fewer runs of a machine of larger capacity may have lower running costs and better energy and [[water efficiency]] than frequent use of a smaller machine, particularly for large families. Running a large machine with small loads is wasteful.\n\nFor many years energy and water efficiency were not regulated, and little attention was paid to them. From the last part of the twentieth century increasing attention was paid to efficiency, with regulations enforcing some standards, and efficiency being a selling point, both to save on running costs and to reduce [[carbon dioxide]] emissions associated with energy generation, and waste of water.\n\nAs energy and water efficiency became regulated, they became a selling point, however, the effectiveness of rinsing was not regulated, and it didn't directly become a selling point. Therefore, manufacturers tended to reduce the degree of rinsing after washing, saving water and motor energy. This had the side-effect of leaving more detergent residue in clothes. Insufficient rinsing can leave enough detergent in clothes to affect people with allergies or sensitivity.<ref name=\"whitegoodshelp1\"/>\n\n===Europe===\n[[File:Energy label en.svg|thumb|upright|The EU requires washing machines carry an efficiency label]]\nWashing machines display an [[EU Energy Label]] with grades for energy efficiency, washing performance and spin efficiency. Grades for energy efficiency run from A+++ to G (best to worst), providing a simple method for judging running costs. Washing performance and spin efficiency are graded in the range A to G. However, all machines for sale must have washing performance A, such that manufacturers cannot compromise washing performance in order to improve the energy efficiency. This labeling has had the desired effect of driving customers toward more efficient washing machines and away from less efficient ones.\n\nThe TopTenEU and other national TopTen European organizations provide independent recommendations for high efficient washing machines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.topten.eu/english/criteria/washing-machines-2.html&fromid= |title=Selection criteria washing machines |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425102236/http://www.topten.eu/english/criteria/washing-machines-2.html%26fromid%3D |archive-date=April 25, 2016 |publisher=TopTenEU}}</ref>\n\nAccording to newer [[regulation]]s, each washing machine is equipped with a waste water filter. There are two reasons for that. On one hand it has to be ensured that no hazardous [[chemical substance]]s are disposed of improperly through the waste water channel; on the other hand it must also be ensured that in case of a backwards shear in the waste water channel that is possible in case of technical problems, the [[feces]] and other [[waste]] could not enter the washing machine.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|isbn = 978-3-906484-57-0|url = http://www.eawag.ch/forschung/sandec/publikationen/compendium_e/index_EN|title = Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies |edition=2nd |author= Tilley, E. |author2=Ulrich, L. |author3=L\u00fcthi, C. |author4=Reymond, Ph. |author5=Zurbr\u00fcgg, C.|publisher = Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag) |location=Duebendorf, Switzerland|page = 147|year = 2014}}</ref>\n\n===United States===\nTop-loading and front-loading clothes washers are covered by a single Federal Standard regulating energy consumption.

Certified Energy Star units can be compared by their Modified Energy Factor (MEF) and Water Factor (WF) coefficients.\n \nThe MEF tells us how many [[cubic feet]] (about 28.3 liters) of clothes are washed per kWh (kilowatt hour) and is closely related to the configuration of the washer (top-loading, front-loading), its spin speed and the temperatures and the amount of water used in the rinse and wash cycles.\n\nEnergy Star residential clothes washers have a MEF of at least 2.0 (the higher the better), but the best machines may reach 3.5. Energy Star washers have also a WF of less than 6.0 (the lower the better).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=clotheswash.pr_crit_clothes_washers |title=Clothes Washers Key Product Criteria |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151109211645/http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=clotheswash.pr_crit_clothes_washers |archive-date=November 9, 2015 |publisher=Energy Star}}</ref>\n\n==Commercial use==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2012}}\n[[File:Laundry in Paris.jpg|thumb|Commercial washing machines and dryers (at left) in a self-service laundry (Paris, France)]]\n[[File:Laundromat ontario.jpg|thumb|Commercial washing machines in a self-service laundromat (Toronto, Canada)]]\nA commercial washing machine is intended for more frequent use than a consumer washing machine.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Katayama|first=Michiko|last2=Sugihara|first2=Reiko|date=2011-02-14|title=Which type of washing machine should you choose?|journal=International Journal of Consumer Studies|volume=35|issue=2|pages=237\u2013242|doi=10.1111/j.1470-6431.2010.00977.x|issn=1470-6423}}</ref> Durability and functionality is more important than style; most commercial washers are bulky and heavy, often with more expensive stainless steel construction to minimize corrosion in a constantly moist environment. They are built with large easy-to-open service covers, and washers are designed not to require access to the underside for service. Often commercial washers are installed in long rows with a wide access passageway behind all the machines to allow maintenance without moving the heavy machines.\n\n===Laundromat machines===\nMany commercial washers are built for use by the general public, and are installed in publicly accessible [[laundromat]]s or laundrettes, operated by [[currency acceptor|money accepting devices]] or [[Magnetic stripe card|card readers]]. The features of a commercial laundromat washer are more limited than a consumer washer, usually offering just two or three basic wash programs and an option to choose wash cycle temperatures.\n\nThe common front-loading commercial washing machine also differs from consumer models in its expulsion of wash and rinse water. While the consumer models [[pump]] used washer water out, allowing the waste line to be located above the washer, front loading commercial machines generally use only [[gravity]] to expel used water. A drain in the rear, at the bottom of the machine opens at the appointed time during the cycle and water flows out. This creates the need for a drainage trough behind machines, which leads to a filter and drain. The trough is usually part of a cement platform built for the purpose of raising the machines to a convenient height,  and can be seen behind washers at most laundromats.\n\nMost laundromat machines are horizontal-axis front-loading models, because of their lower operating costs (notably lower consumption of expensive hot water).\n\n===Industrial washers===\n<!-- [[File:Lapauw Combi 2000.jpg|thumb|A 1980s Belgian {{convert|180|kg|0|abbr=on}} load industrial washer in a Hotel in Brussels (horizontal axis, front load)]] -->\n[[File:Lapauw Combi 1000.jpg|thumb|upright|A 1980s Belgian {{nowrap|90 kg}} load industrial washer (horizontal axis, front load)]]\nBy contrast, commercial washers for ''internal'' business operations (still often referred to as \"washer/extractor\" machines) may include features absent from domestic machines. Many commercial washers offer an option for automatic injection of five or more different chemical types, so that the operator does not have to deal with constantly measuring out soap products and fabric softeners for each load by hand. Instead, a precise metering system draws the detergents and wash additives directly from large liquid-chemical storage barrels and injects them as needed into the various wash and rinse cycles. Some computer-controlled commercial washers offer the operator  control over the various wash and rinse cycles, allowing the operator to program custom washing cycles.\n\nMost large-scale industrial washers are horizontal-axis machines, but may have front-, side-, or top-load doors. Some industrial clothes washers can batch-process up to {{convert|800|lb}} of textiles at once, and can be used for extremely machine-abusive washing tasks such as [[stone washing]] or fabric [[bleaching]] and [[dyeing]].\n\nAn industrial washer can be mounted on heavy-duty [[shock absorbers]] and attached to a concrete floor, so that it can extract water from even the most severely out-of-balance and heavy wash loads. Noise and vibration is not as unacceptable as in a domestic machine. It may be mounted on [[hydraulic cylinders]], permitting the entire washer to be lifted and tilted so that fabrics can be automatically dumped from the wash drum onto a [[conveyor belt]] once the cycle is complete. \n \nOne special type of continuous-processing washer is known as the [[tunnel washer]].  This specialized high-capacity machine does not have a drum where everything being washed undergoes distinct wash and rinse cycles, but moves the laundry slowly and continuously through a long, large-diameter horizontal-axis rotating tube in the manner of an [[assembly line]], with different processes at different positions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.isopasse.com.br/dicas/lavadora-de-roupas-melhor-marca/|title=Lavadora de Roupas - Qual a melhor marca?|last=Guilherme|date=2017-08-17|website=Isopasse|language=pt-BR|access-date=2018-12-16}}</ref>\n\n==Social impact==\n[[File:Woman's Friend - Indiana State Museum - DSC00433.JPG|thumb|\"Woman's Friend\" machine (c. 1890)]]\nThe historically laborious process of washing clothes ([[wikt:laundry day|a task which often had a whole day set aside to perform]]) has at times been labelled 'woman's work'.

That made the warm soapy water precious; it would be reused, first to wash the least soiled clothing, then to wash progressively dirtier laundry.\n\nRemoval of soap and water from the clothing after washing was a separate process. First, soap would be rinsed out with clear water. After rinsing, the soaking wet clothing would be formed into a roll and twisted by hand to extract water. The entire process often occupied an entire day of hard work, plus drying and ironing.\n\nEven today, worldwide, probably more people have their clothes handwashed than with a washing machine.{{cn|date=April 2020}} They may use a central facility such as a [[Dhobi Ghat|dhobi ghat]], a simple bucket or bowl, or a local stream.\n\n[[File:Miele 100.jpg|thumb|upright|1930 electric wringer/ mangle washing machine.]]\n[[File:OldMiele2.jpg|thumb|Early [[Miele]] washing machine with a [[Mangle (machine)|mangle]] (probably 1930).]]\n\n===Early machines===\n[[File:Washing machine.jpg|thumb|19th-century Metropolitan washing machine]]\n[[File:Waschmaschine Historisch.jpg|thumb|upright|A vintage German model]]\n\nThe first English [[patent]] \nunder the category of Washing machines was issued in 1691.<ref>''Mothers and Daughters of Invention: Notes for a Revised History of Technology'', Autumn Stanley, [[Rutgers University]] Press, 1995, p. 301</ref>  A drawing of an early washing machine appeared in the January 1752 issue of ''The Gentleman's Magazine'', a British publication.

The mechanism was now enclosed within a cabinet, and more attention was paid to electrical and mechanical safety. [[Spin dryer]]s were introduced to replace the dangerous power mangle/wringers of the day.\n\nBy 1940, 60% of the 25,000,000 wired homes in the United States had an electric washing machine. Many of these machines featured a power wringer, although built-in spin dryers were not uncommon.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n===Automatic machines===\n[[File:Mineral Wells May 2017 22 (The Laumdronat and Washing Machine Museum interior).jpg|thumb|The Washing Machine Museum in [[Mineral Wells, Texas]]]]\n\nBendix Home Appliances, a subsidiary of [[Avco]], introduced the first domestic automatic washing machine in 1937,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oUkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA119&dq=Bendix+washer#v=onepage&q=Bendix%20washer&f=false|title=LIFE|publisher=|accessdate=13 February 2016|date=1950-04-24}}</ref> having applied for a patent in the same year.<ref>{{US patent|2165884}}</ref> Avco had licensed the name from [[Bendix Corporation]], an otherwise unrelated company. In appearance and mechanical detail, this first machine was not unlike the front loading automatic washers produced today. \n\nAlthough it included many of today's basic features, the machine lacked any drum suspension and therefore had to be anchored to the floor to prevent \"walking\". Because of the components required, the machine was also very expensive. For instance, the Bendix Home Laundry Service Manual (published November 1, 1946) shows that the drum speed change was facilitated by a 2-speed gearbox built to a heavy duty standard (not unlike a car automatic gearbox, albeit at a smaller size). The timer was also probably fairly costly, because miniature electric motors were expensive to produce.\n\nEarly automatic washing machines were usually connected to a water supply via temporary slip-on connectors to sink taps. Later, permanent connections to both the hot and cold water supplies became the norm, as dedicated laundry water hookups became common. Most modern front-loading European machines now only have a cold water connection (called \"cold fill\") and rely completely on internal electric heaters to raise the water temperature.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trocknerland.com/waermepumpentrockner |title=Test & Vergleich |accessdate=March 17, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305225117/http://www.trocknerland.com/waermepumpentrockner/ |archivedate=March 5, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nMany of the early automatic machines had coin-in-the-slot facilities and were installed in the basement laundry rooms of apartment houses.\n\n===World War II and after=== \n{{Globalize |date=September 2016|reason=This is not the \"Washing machine in the US\" article!}}\n[[File:Bendix washing machine. Melbourne Museum.jpg|thumb|A classic Bendix washing machine]]\n[[File:Waschvollautomat Constructa 1950er.jpg|thumb|upright|A 1950s model Constructa]]\n\nAfter the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], US domestic washer production was suspended for the duration of [[World War II]] in favor of manufacturing war [[materiel|material]]. However, numerous US appliance manufacturers were given permission to undertake the research and development of washers during the war years. Many took the opportunity to develop automatic machines, realizing that these represented the future for the industry.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://gogd.tjs-labs.com/show-picture?id=1129064419 | author=A. S. Campbell Co. | title = Your Next Washing Machine (or is it?) |date=1942-12-28 |magazine=Time |page=88 | accessdate = 13 September 2012}}</ref>\n\nA large number of US manufacturers introduced competing automatic machines (mainly of the top-loading type) in the late 1940s and early 1950s. [[General Electric]] also introduced its first top loading automatic model in 1947. This machine had many of the features that are incorporated into modern machines. Another early form of automatic washing machine manufactured by [[The Hoover Company]] used cartridges to program different wash cycles. This system, called the \"Keymatic\", used plastic cartridges with key-like slots and ridges around the edges. The cartridge was inserted into a slot on the machine and a mechanical reader operated the machine accordingly.\n\nSeveral manufacturers produced semi-automatic machines, requiring the user to intervene at one or two points in the wash cycle. A common semi-automatic type (available from Hoover in the UK until at least the 1970s) included two tubs: one with an agitator or impeller for washing, plus another smaller tub for water extraction or centrifugal rinsing.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nSince their introduction, automatic washing machines have relied on [[timer|electromechanical timer]]s to sequence the washing and extraction process. Electromechanical timers consist of a series of [[cam]]s on a common shaft driven by a small electric motor via a [[reduction gearbox]]. At the appropriate time in the wash cycle, each cam actuates a switch to engage or disengage a particular part of the machinery (for example, the drain pump motor). One of the first was invented in 1957 by [[Winston L. Shelton]] and Gresham N. Jennings, then both [[General Electric]] engineers. The device was granted US Patent 2870278.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.google.la/patents/US2870278 | title = Timing mechanism for conducting a selected one of a plurality of sequences of operation | accessdate = 2 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn the early electromechanical timers, the motor ran at a constant speed throughout the wash cycle, although it was possible for the user to truncate parts of the program by manually advancing the control dial. However, by the 1950s demand for greater flexibility in the wash cycle led to the introduction of more sophisticated electrical timers to supplement the electromechanical timer. These newer timers enabled greater variation in functions such as the wash time. With this arrangement, the electric timer motor is periodically switched off to permit the clothing to soak, and is only re-energized just prior to a micro-switch being engaged or disengaged for the next stage of the process.  Fully electronic timers did not become widespread until decades later.\n\nDespite the high cost of automatic washers, manufacturers had difficulty in meeting the demand.[https://www.clashofclansapk.com/clash-of-magic/] Although there were material shortages during the [[Korean War]], by 1953 automatic washing machine sales in the US exceeded those of wringer-type electric machines.\n\nIn the UK and in most of Europe, electric washing machines did not become popular until the 1950s. This was largely because of the economic impact of World War II on the consumer market, which did not properly recover until the late 1950s. The early electric washers were single-tub, wringer-type machines, as fully automatic washing machines were extremely expensive. During the 1960s, twin tub machines briefly became very popular, helped by the low price of the [[Rolls Razor]] washers. Some machines had the ability to pump used wash water into a separate tub for temporary storage, and to later pump it back for re-use. This was done not to save water or soap, but because heated water was expensive and time-consuming to produce. Automatic washing machines did not become dominant in the UK until well into the 1970s and by then were almost exclusively of the front-loader design.\n\nIn early automatic washing machines, any changes in impeller/drum speed were achieved by mechanical means or by a [[rheostat]] on the motor power supply. However, since the 1970s electronic control of motor speed has become a common feature on the more expensive models.\n\n===Modern washers===\n<!-- If you have doubts about something, do not delete text, instead, add the citation needed template or go search for citations! -->\nOver time manufacturers of automatic washers have gone to great lengths to reduce cost. For instance, expensive gearboxes are no longer required, since motor speed can be controlled electronically. Some models can be controlled via WiFi, and have angled drums to facilitate loading. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://panasonic.jp/wash/products/na_vg2400.html|title=\u306a\u306a\u3081\u30c9\u30e9\u30e0\u6d17\u6fef\u4e7e\u71e5\u6a5f NA-VG2400L/R &#124; \u5546\u54c1\u4e00\u89a7 &#124; \u6d17\u6fef\u6a5f\uff0f\u8863\u985e\u4e7e\u71e5\u6a5f &#124; Panasonic|website=panasonic.jp}}</ref>\n\nEven on some expensive washers, the outer drum of front loading machines is often (but not always) made of plastic (it can also be made out of metal but this is expensive). This makes [[Planned obsolescence|changing the main bearings difficult]], as the plastic drum usually cannot be separated into two halves to enable the inner drum to be removed to gain access to the bearing.\n\nSome manufacturers have taken steps to reduce vibration emanating from their washers, by means of reducing or controlling motor speeds, using hydraulic suspensions instead of spring suspensions, and having freely moving steel balls (Samsung VRT) or liquid contained inside a ring mounted on both the front and back sides of the drum in order to counter the weight of the clothes and reduce vibration.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hitachi-hk.com.hk/en/products/index_id_2015.html|title=Home Appliances - Washer - Front Loading Drum Type - BD-W90XWV|website=www.hitachi-hk.com.hk}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hmsi-hitachi.co.th/eng/|title=Hitachi Modern Sales Thailand|website=hmsi-hitachi.co.th}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hmsi-hitachi.co.th/eng/|title=Hitachi Modern Sales Thailand|website=hmsi-hitachi.co.th}}</ref>\n\nSome machines, since 1998<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lg.com/levant_en/press-release/direct-drive-motor-featured-in-lgs-washing-machines-earns-prestigious-vde-certification|title=Drive Motor In LG'S Washing Machines |website=LG Levant |language=en|access-date=2018-12-16}}</ref> now use a direct drive motor, a low aspect ratio device, where the stator assembly is attached to the rear of the outer drum, whilst the co-axial rotor is mounted on the shaft of the inner drum.<ref>{{cite patent|title=Direct drive motor in washing machine|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US7750531B2/en|country=US|number=7750531B2|issue-date=2005-11-08|access-date=2018-12-16}}</ref> Direct drive eliminates the need for a pulley, belt and belt tensioner.

This type of horizontal axis washer and dryer (with a circular drum) is often used in Europe, where space is limited, as they can be as thin as 40&nbsp;cm in width.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.candy.com.ar/lavado/lavado-carga-superior/evo-plaisir-cyt-861d|title=Candy - Evo Plaisir CYT 861D|website=www.candy.com.ar}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, [[New Zealand]]-based company [[Fisher & Paykel]] introduced its SmartDrive washing machine line in the US. This washing machine uses a computer-controlled system to determine certain factors such as load size and automatically adjusts the wash cycle to match. It also used a mixed system of washing, first with the \"Eco-Active\" wash, using a low level of recirculated water being sprayed on the load followed by a more traditional style wash. The SmartDrive also included direct drive [[brushless DC electric motor]], which simplified the bowl and agitator drive by doing away with the need for a gearbox system.\n\nIn 2000, the British [[inventor]] [[James Dyson]] launched the CR01 [[ContraRotator]], a type of washing machine with two cylinders rotating in opposite directions. It was claimed that this design reduced the wash time and produced cleaner washing than a single cylinder machine. In 2004 there was the launch of the CR02, which was the first washing machine to gain the British Allergy Foundation Seal of Approval. However, neither of the ContraRotator machines are now in production as they were too expensive to manufacture. They were discontinued in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dyson|first=James|title=Inside Dyson: CR01|url=http://content.dyson.co.uk/insideDyson/article.asp?aID=cr01&disType=nonFlash&dir=&cp=&hf=1&js=1|publisher=dyson.co.uk|accessdate=13 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523024545/http://content.dyson.co.uk/insideDyson/article.asp?aID=cr01&disType=nonFlash&dir=&cp=&hf=1&js=1|archive-date=23 May 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-12-18/james-dyson-on-killing-the-contrarotator-his-educative-failure|title=James Dyson on Killing the Contrarotator, His 'Educative Failure'|date=2012-12-18|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-02-19|language=en}}</ref> It is patented under [https://patents.google.com/patent/US7750531B2/en U.S. Patent US7750531B2], [https://patents.google.com/patent/US6311527 U.S. Patent US6311527], [https://patents.google.com/patent/US20010023513 U.S. Patent US20010023513], [https://patents.google.com/patent/US6311527B1/en?q=D06F21%2f04 U.S. Patent US6311527B1], [https://patents.google.com/patent/USD450164 U.S. Patent USD450164].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.international.dyson.com:80/tech/contrarotator/patents.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041112141138/http://www.international.dyson.com/tech/contrarotator/patents.asp|url-status=dead|archive-date=2004-11-12|title=Dyson - Patent and design applications|date=2004-11-12|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, [[Whirlpool Corporation]] introduced the Calypso, the first vertical-axis high efficiency washing machine to be top-loading.

The pans on the inside of the lid are placed atop the agitator, and wash water is pumped through the perforated pans to collect lint. (California)]]\n[[File:Toroidal coord.png|thumb|In a top-loading washer, water circulates primarily along the poloidal axis during the wash cycle, as indicated by the red arrow in this illustration of a [[torus]].]]\n\nThe top loading, vertical axis cloth washer, is the dominant design in the United States and Canada. This design places the clothes in a vertically mounted perforated basket that is contained within a water-retaining tub, with a finned water-pumping [[agitator (device)|agitator]] in the center of the bottom of the basket. Clothes are loaded through the top of the machine, which is usually but not always covered with a hinged door.\n\nDuring the wash cycle, the outer tub is filled with water sufficient to fully immerse and suspend the clothing freely in the basket. The movement of the agitator pushes water outward between the paddles towards the edge of the tub. The water then moves outward, up the sides of the basket, towards the center, and then down towards the agitator to repeat the process, in a circulation pattern similar to the shape of a [[torus]]. The agitator direction is periodically reversed, because continuous motion in one direction would just lead to the water spinning around the basket with the agitator rather than the water being pumped in the torus-shaped motion. Some washers supplement the water-pumping action of the agitator with a large rotating screw on the shaft above the agitator, to help move water downwards in the center of the basket.\n\nSince the agitator and the drum are separate and distinct in a top-loading washing machine, the mechanism of a top-loader is inherently more complicated than a front-loading machine. Manufacturers have devised several ways to control the motion of the agitator during wash and rinse separately from the high speed rotation of the drum required for the spin cycle.\n\nWhile a top-loading washing machine could use a [[universal motor]] or DC brushless motor, it is conventional for top-loading washing machines to use more expensive, heavy, and more electrically efficient and reliable [[induction motor]]s. The action of a front-loading washing machine is better suited to a motor capable of reversing direction with every reversal of the wash basket; a universal motor is noisier, less efficient, doesn't last as long, but is better suited to the task of reversing direction every few seconds.\n\nAn alternative to the oscillating agitator design is the impeller type washtub pioneered by [[The Hoover Company|Hoover]] on its long running ''Hoovermatic'' series of top loading machines.  Here, an [[impeller]] (trademarked by Hoover as a \"Pulsator\") mounted on the side of the tub spins in a constant direction, and creates a fast moving current of water in the tub which drags the clothes through the water along a toroidal path. The impeller design has the advantage of its mechanical simplicity - a single speed motor with belt drive is all that is required to drive the Pulsator with no need for gearboxes or complex electrical controls, but has the disadvantage of lower load capacity in relation to tub size. Hoovermatic machines were made mostly in twin tub format for the European market - (where they competed with [[Hotpoint]]'s ''Supermatic'' line which used the oscillating agitator design) until the early 1990s.  Some industrial garment testing machines still use the Hoover wash action.\n\nThe many different ways different manufacturers have solved the same problem over the years is a good example of many different ways to solve the same [[engineering]] problem with different goals, different manufacturing capabilities and expertise, and different [[patent]] encumbrances.\n\n====Reversible motor====\nIn most current top-loading washers, if the motor spins in one direction, the [[Transmission (mechanics)|gearbox]] drives the agitator; if the motor spins the other way, the gearbox locks the agitator and spins the basket and agitator together. Similarly, if the pump motor rotates one way it recirculates the sudsy water; in the other direction it pumps water from the machine during the spin cycle. Mechanically, this system is very simple.\n\n====Mode-changing transmission====\nIn some top loaders, the motor runs only in one direction. During agitation, the transmission converts the rotation into the alternating motion driving the agitator. During the spin cycle, the timer turns on a [[solenoid]] which engages a [[clutch]] locking the motor's rotation to the wash basket, providing a spin cycle. General Electric's very popular line of Filter-Flo (seen to the right) used a variant of this design where the motor reversed only to pump water out of the machine. The same clutch which allows the heavy tub full of wet clothes to \"slip\" as it comes up to the motor's speed, is also allowed to \"slip\" during agitation to engage a Gentle Cycle for delicate clothes.\n\nWhirlpool (Kenmore) created a popular design demonstrating the complex mechanisms which could be used to produce different motions from a single motor with the so-called \"[[wig wag (washing machines)|wig wag]]\" mechanism, which was used for decades until modern controls rendered it obsolete. In the Whirlpool mechanism, a protruding moving piece oscillates in time with the agitation motion. Two solenoids are mounted to this protruding moving piece, with wires attaching them to the timer. During the cycle, the motor operates continuously, and the solenoids on the \"wig wag\" engage agitation or spin. Despite the wires controlling the solenoids being subject to abrasion and broken connections due to their constant motion and the solenoids operating in a damp environment where corrosion could damage them, these machines were surprisingly reliable.\n\n====Reversible motor with mode-changing transmission====\n\nSome top-loaders, especially compact apartment-sized washers, use a hybrid mechanism. The motor reverses direction every few seconds, often with a pause between direction changes, to perform the agitation. Spin cycle is accomplished by engaging a clutch in the transmission. A separate motorized pump is generally used to drain this style of machine. These machines could easily be implemented with [[universal motor]]s or more modern DC [[brushless motors]], but older ones tend to use a capacitor-start [[induction motor]] with a pause between reversals of agitation.\n\n====Top-load advantages====\n\nThe top-loader's spin cycle between washing and rinsing allows an extremely simple passive [[fabric softener]] dispenser, which operates through [[centrifugal force]] and [[Gravitation|gravity]]. Fabric softener, vinegar, or any other liquid rinse agent, is placed in a cup at the top of the agitator. It \"rides along\" during the wash cycle. When the spin cycle is engaged, the fabric softener is pulled up by a tapered cup and centrifugal force, where it collects in the top of the spinning agitator. Once the spin cycle is completed, centrifugal force no longer suspends the fabric softener and it falls through the center of the agitator to join the rinse water coming into the tub. The same objective must be accomplished by a [[solenoid valve]] or a pump, and associated timer controls and wiring, on a front loader.\n\nA lint trap can also be built into the center of the agitator,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.consul.com.br/produto/lavadora-consul-facilite-9-kg/|title=M\u00e1quina de Lavar Consul 9kg Turbo Lavagem|work=Consul|access-date=2018-02-19|language=pt-BR}}</ref> or on the drum's walls,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://panasonic.jp/wash/product/fa_fw_jfa/auto_cleaning.html|title=FW/FD/FA/JFA\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u7279\u9577\uff1a\u81ea\u52d5\u69fd\u6d17\u6d44/\u30ab\u30d3\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u30bf\u30f3\u30af/\u300c\u30ca\u30ce\u30a4\u30fc\u300d\u69fd\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3 {{!}} \u6d17\u6fef\u6a5f\uff0f\u8863\u985e\u4e7e\u71e5\u6a5f {{!}} Panasonic|website=panasonic.jp|language=ja|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lg.com/in/support/video-tutorials/CT20150045-1394432728524-maintenance|title=LG Video Tutorials: Video: Magic/Lint Filter Cleaning ( Top loading) {{!}} LG India|website=www.lg.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.samsung.com/in/support/skp/faq/137356|title=What is the function of Magic Filter in a Samsung Washing Machine?|website=www.samsung.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.samsung.com/za/support/skp/faq/1139253|title=What is Magic Filter in Samsung Washing Machine ?|website=www.samsung.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.samsung.com/in/support/skp/faq/1138351|title=How to clean the Magic filter in Samsung Washing Machine ?|website=www.samsung.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref>  passively collecting lint from water forced through the agitator. Front-loaders tend to require separate pumps and plumbing to provide lint filters which are often mounted behind covers on the bottom of the machine.\n\nAnother advantage to the top loading design is the reliance on gravity to contain the water, rather than potentially trouble-prone or short-lived front door seals. Top loaders may require less periodic maintenance, since there is no need to clean a door seal or bellows, although a plastic tub may still require a periodic \"maintenance wash\" cycle (described below).\n\nAs with front-loading washers, clothing should not be packed tightly into a top-loading washer. Although wet fabric usually fits into a smaller space than dry fabric, a dense wad of fabric can restrict water circulation, resulting in poor soap distribution and incomplete rinsing. Extremely overloaded top-loading washers can either jam the motion of the agitator, overloading or damaging the motor or gearbox, burning drive belts, or tearing fabrics - many Whirlpool/Kenmore machines even have a mechanical \"fuse\" designed to break before the expensive motor is damaged. Extreme overloading can also push fabrics into the small gap between the underside of the agitator and the bottom of the wash basket, resulting in fabrics wrapped around the agitator shaft, possibly requiring agitator removal to unjam.\n\nSome top-loading machines use mechanisms very similar to front-loading drum machines, and are [[#Variant and hybrid designs|described below]].\n\n===Front-loading===\n[[File:WashingMachine, manufactured by ArcticRomania.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Arctic S.A.|Arctic]] BE1200A+ is a front loading budget model sold in 2008 with {{convert|6|kg|adj=on}} load, LCD indicator, 1200 RPM]]\n[[File:Drum of a washing machine (Bosch Maxx WFO 2440).jpg|thumb|Modern drum of front-loading washing machine (Bosch Maxx WFO 2440)]]\nThe front-loading or horizontal-axis clothes washer is the dominant design in Europe. In the U.S. and elsewhere, most \"high-end\" washing machines are of this type. In addition, most commercial and industrial clothes washers around the world are of the horizontal-axis design.\n\nThis layout mounts the inner basket and outer tub horizontally, and loading is through a door at the front of the machine. The door often but not always contains a transparent window. Agitation is supplied by the back-and-forth rotation of the cylinder and by gravity. The clothes are lifted up by paddles on the inside wall of the drum and then dropped. This motion flexes the weave of the fabric and forces water and detergent solution through the clothes load. Because the wash action does not require the clothing be freely suspended in water, only enough water is needed to moisten the fabric. Because less water is required, front-loaders typically use less soap, and the repeated dropping and folding action of the tumbling can easily produce large amounts of foam or suds.\n\nFront-loaders control water usage through the [[surface tension]] of water, and the [[capillary action|capillary wicking action]] this creates in the fabric weave. A front-loader washer always fills to the same low water level, but a large pile of dry clothing standing in water will soak up the moisture, causing the water level to drop. The washer then refills to maintain the original water level. Because it takes time for this water absorption to occur with a motionless pile of fabric, nearly all front-loaders begin the washing process by slowly tumbling the clothing under the stream of water entering and filling the drum, to rapidly saturate the clothes with water.\n\nFront-loading washers are mechanically simple compared to top-loaders, with the main motor (a [[universal motor]] or [[variable-frequency drive]] motor) normally being connected to the drum via a grooved pulley belt and large [[pulley]] wheel, without the need for a gearbox, clutch or crank. But front-load washers suffer from their own technical problems, due to the drum lying sideways. For example, a top loading washer keeps water inside the tub merely through the force of [[gravity]] pulling down on the water, while a front-loader must tightly seal the door shut with a [[gasket]] to prevent water dripping onto the floor during the wash cycle. This access door is locked shut during the entire wash cycle, since opening the door with the machine in use could result in water gushing out onto the floor. For front-loaders without viewing windows on the door, it is possible to accidentally pinch fabric between the door and the drum, resulting in tearing and damage to the pinched clothing during tumbling and spinning.\n\nNearly all front-loader washers for the consumer market also use a folded flexible [[bellows]] assembly around the door opening, to keep clothing contained inside the basket during the tumbling wash cycle. If this bellows assembly were not used, small articles of clothing such as socks could slip out of the wash basket near the door, and fall down the narrow slot between the outer tub and basket, plugging the drain and possibly jamming rotation of the inner basket. Retrieving lost items from between the outer tub and inner basket can require complete disassembly of the front of the washer and pulling out the entire inner wash basket. Commercial and industrial front-loaders used by businesses (described below) usually do not use the bellows, and instead require all small objects to be placed in a mesh bag to prevent loss near the basket opening.\n\nThe bellows assembly around the door is a potential source of problems for the consumer front-loader. The bellows has a large number of flexible folds to permit the tub to move separately from the door during the high speed extraction cycle. On many machines, these folds can collect lint, dirt, and moisture, resulting in [[mold]] and [[mildew]] growth, and a foul odor. Some front-loading washer operating instructions say the bellows should be wiped down monthly with a strong bleach solution, while others offer a special \"freshening\" cycle where the machine is run empty with a strong dosing of bleach.\n\nThe inherent mechanical weak spot of the front loader design is the [[cantilever]]ed mounting of the inner drum within the outer tub.  The drum bearing has to support the entire weight of the drum, the laundry, and the dynamic loads created by the sloshing of the water and of the imbalance of the load during the spin cycle.  The drum bearing eventually wears out, and usually requires extensive dismantling of the machine to replace, which often results in the machine being [[Write-off|written off]] due to the failure of a relatively inexpensive component that is labor-intensive to renew.  Some manufacturers have compounded this problem by \"overmolding\" the drum bearing into the outer tub to reduce manufacturing costs, but this makes the bearing impossible to renew without replacing the entire outer tub - which usually forces owners to scrap the entire machine - this may be viewed as an implementation of [[Planned obsolescence|built-in obsolescence]].\n\nCompared to top-loading washers, clothing can be packed more tightly in a front loader, up to the full drum volume if using a cottons wash cycle. This is because wet cloth usually fits into a smaller space than dry cloth, and front loaders are able to self-regulate the water needed to achieve correct washing and rinsing. Extreme overloading of front-loading washers pushes fabrics towards the small gap between the loading door and the front of the wash basket, potentially resulting in fabrics lost between the basket and outer tub, and in severe cases, tearing of clothing and jamming the motion of the basket.\n\n===Variant and hybrid designs===\n[[File:European top washingmachine.jpg|thumb|European top loader with horizontal axis rotating drum (2008)]]\n<!-- [[File:tvatt.jpg|thumb|European top loader with horizontal axis rotating drum (2001)]] -->\n\nThere are many variations of the two general designs. Top-loading machines in [[Asia]] use [[impeller]]s instead of agitators. Impellers are similar to agitators except that they do not have the center post extending up in the middle of the wash tub basket.\n\nSome machines which actually load from the top are otherwise much more similar to front-loading horizontal-axis drum machines. They have a drum rotating around a horizontal axis, as a front-loader, but there is no front door; instead there is a liftable lid which provides access to the drum, which has a hatch which can be latched shut. Clothes are loaded, the hatch and lid are closed, and the machine operates and spins just like a front-loader. These machines are narrower but usually taller than front-loaders, usually have a lower capacity, and are intended for use where only a narrow space is available, as is sometimes the case in Europe. They have incidental advantages: they can be loaded without bending down; they do not require a perishable rubber bellows seal; and instead of the drum having a single bearing on one side, it has a pair of symmetrical bearings, one on each side, avoiding asymmetrical bearing loading and potentially increasing life. This type of washing machine is popular in Europe, where space is limited, as a washer can be as little as 40&nbsp;cm wide, and a full washer and dryer installation can be as little as 80&nbsp;cm wide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.candy.fi/en_GB/appliances/wash-dry/top-loading-washing-machines/-/catalog/16314605/clt-272l-s|title=Candy Top loading washing machines. Comfort and efficiency - Candy|website=www.candy.fi|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref>\n\nThere are also [[combo washer dryer]] machines that combine washing cycles and a full drying cycle in the same drum, eliminating the need to transfer wet clothes from a washer to a dryer machine.  In principle, these machines are convenient for overnight cleaning (the combined cycle is considerably longer), but the effective capacity for cleaning larger batches of laundry is drastically reduced. The drying process tends to use much more energy than using two separate devices, because a combo washer dryer not only must dry the clothing, but also needs to dry out the wash chamber itself. These machines are used more in Europe, because they can be fitted into small spaces, and many can be operated without dedicated utility connections. In these machines, the washer and dryer functions often have different capacities, with the dryer usually having the lowest capacity. These machines should not be confused with a dryer on top of a washer installation, or with a laundry center, which is a one piece appliance offering a compromise between a washer-dryer combo and a full washer to the side of the dryer installation or a dryer on top of a washer installation. Laundry centers usually have the dryer on top of the washer, with the controls for both machines being on a single control panel. Often, the controls are simpler than the controls on a washer-dryer combo or a dedicated washer and dryer. Some implementations are patented under [https://patents.google.com/patent/US6343492B1/en?q=D06F37%2f04 US Patent US6343492B1] and [https://patents.google.com/patent/US6363756B1/en?q=D06F37%2f04 US Patent US 6363756B1].\n\n===Comparison===\nTrue front-loaders, and top-loading machines with horizontal-axis drum as described above, can be compared with top-loaders on a number of aspects:\n\n* Efficient cleaning: Front-loaders usually use less energy, water, and detergent compared to the best top-loaders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lanfaxlabs.com.au/washing_machines.htm | title=Laundry Products Research | date=March 2008}}</ref> High efficiency washers use 20% to 60% of the detergent, water and energy of standard\"{{explain|date=February 2020}} washers.  They usually take somewhat longer (20\u2013110 minutes) to wash a load, but are often computer controlled with additional sensors, to adapt the wash cycle to the needs of each load.  As this technology improves, the [[human interface]] will also improve, to make it easier to understand and control the many different cleaning options.\n* Water usage: Front-loaders usually use less water than top-loading residential clothes washers. Estimates are that front-loaders use from one third<ref>{{cite web|url=http://housewares.about.com/lw/Home-Garden/Home-improvement-renovation/Top-Loading-vs-Front-Loading-Washers-Which-is-Better-.htm | title=About.com}}</ref> to one half<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consumerenergycenter.org/home/appliances/washers.html | title=Consumer Energy Center}}</ref> as much water as top-loaders.\n* Spin-dry effectiveness: Front-loaders (and European horizontal axis top loaders and some front loaders) offer much higher maximum spin speeds of up to 2000&nbsp;[[revolutions per minute|RPM]], although home machines tend to be in the 1000 to 1400&nbsp;RPM range, while top-loaders (with agitators) do not exceed 1140&nbsp;RPM.  High-efficiency top-loaders with a wash plate (instead of an agitator) can spin up to 1100 RPM, as their center of gravity is lower.  Higher spin speeds, along with the diameter of the drum, determine the [[g-force]], and a higher g-force removes more residual water, making clothes dry faster. This also reduces energy consumption if clothes are dried in a [[clothes dryer]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n* Cycle length: Top-loaders have tended to have shorter cycle times, in part because their design has traditionally emphasized simplicity and speed of operation more than resource conservation.\n* Wear and abrasion: Top-loaders require an agitator or impeller mechanism to force enough water through clothes to clean them effectively, which greatly increases mechanical wear and tear on fabrics.  Front-loaders use paddles in the drum to repeatedly pick up and drop clothes into water for cleaning; this gentler action causes less wear.  The amount of clothes wear can be roughly gauged by the amount of accumulation in a clothes dryer [[lint (material)|lint]] filter, since the lint largely consists of stray fibers detached from textiles during washing and drying.\n* Difficult items: Top-loaders may have trouble cleaning large items, such as [[sleeping bag]]s or [[pillow]]s, which tend to float on top of the wash water rather than circulate within it. In addition, vigorous top-loader agitator motions may damage delicate fabrics.\n* Noise: Front-loaders tend to operate more quietly than top-loaders because the door seal helps contain noise, and because there is less of a tendency to imbalance. Top-loaders usually need a [[mechanical transmission]] (due to agitators, see above), which can generate more noise than the rubber belt or direct drive found in most front loaders.\n* Compactness: True front-loading machines may be installed underneath counter-height work surfaces. A front-loading washing machine, in a fully fitted kitchen, may even be disguised as a [[kitchen cabinet]].  These models can also be convenient in homes with limited floor area, since the clothes dryer may be installed directly above the washer (\"stacked\" configuration).\n* Water leakage: Top-loading machines are less prone to leakage, because simple [[gravity]] can reliably keep water from spilling out the loading door on top.  True front-loading machines require a flexible seal or gasket on the front door, and the front door must be locked during operation to prevent opening, lest large amounts of water spill out.  This seal may leak and require replacement.  However, many current front-loaders use so little water that they can be stopped mid-cycle for addition or removal of laundry, while keeping the water level in the horizontal tub below the door level.  Best practice installations of either type of machine will include a [[floor drain]] or an overflow catch tray with a drain connection, since neither design is immune to leakage or a [[solenoid valve]] getting stuck in the open position.\n* Maintenance and reliability: Top-loading washers are more tolerant of maintenance neglect, and may not need a regular \"freshening\" cycle to clean door seals and bellows. During the spin cycle, a top-loading tub is free to move about inside the cabinet of the machine, using only a lip around the top of the inner basket and outer tub to keep the spinning water and clothing from spraying out over the edge. Therefore, the potentially problematic door-sealing and door-locking mechanisms used by true front-loaders are not needed. On the other hand, top-loaders use mechanical gearboxes that are more vulnerable to wear than simpler front-load motor drives.\n* Accessibility and ergonomics: Front-loaders are more convenient for [[Dwarfism|very short people]] and those with [[paraplegia]], as the controls are front-mounted and the horizontal drum eliminates the need for standing or climbing. Risers, also referred to as pedestals, often with storage drawers underneath, can be used to raise the door of a true front-loader closer to the user's level.\n* Initial cost: In countries where top-loaders are popular, front-loaders tend to be more expensive to buy than top-loaders, though their lower operating costs can ultimately lead to lower [[total cost of ownership]], especially if energy, detergent, or water are expensive. On the other hand, in countries with a large front-loader user base, top-loaders are usually seen as alternatives and more expensive than basic off-brand front loaders, although without many differences in [[total cost of ownership]] apart from design-originated ones. In addition, manufacturers have tended to include more advanced features such as internal water heating, automatic dirt sensors, and high-speed emptying on front-loaders, although some of these features could be implemented on top-loaders.\n\n==Wash cycles==\n[[File:Waescheschleuder.jpg|thumb|upright|German laundry [[centrifuge]] to extract water from laundry.  The advent of automatic washing machines with spin cycles made such specialized appliances largely obsolete by the 1970s.]]\n\nThe earliest washing machines simply carried out a washing action when loaded with clothes and soap, filled with hot water, and started. Over time machines became more and more automated, first with very complex electromechanical controllers, then fully electronic controllers; users put clothes into the machine, select a suitable program via a switch, start the machine, and come back to remove clean and slightly damp clothes at the end of the cycle. The controller starts and stops many different processes including pumps and valves to fill and empty the drum with water, heating, and rotating at different speeds, with different combinations of settings for different fabrics.\n\n===Washing===\nMany front loading machines have internal electrical heating elements to heat the wash water, to near boiling if desired. The rate of chemical cleaning action of the detergent and other laundry chemicals increases greatly with temperature, in accordance with the [[Arrhenius equation]]. Washing machines with internal heaters can use special detergents formulated to release different chemical ingredients at different temperatures, allowing different type of stains and soils to be cleaned from the clothes as the wash water is heated up by the electrical heater.\n\nHowever, higher-temperature washing uses more energy, and many fabrics and elastics are damaged at higher temperatures. Temperatures exceeding {{convert|40|\u00b0C}} have the undesirable effect of inactivating the [[enzyme]]s when using [[biological detergent]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nMany machines are cold-fill, connected to cold water only, which they heat to [[operating temperature]]. Where water can be heated more cheaply or with less carbon dioxide emission than by electricity, cold-fill operation is inefficient.\n\nFront loaders need to use low-sudsing detergents because the tumbling action of the drum folds air into the clothes load that can cause over-sudsing and overflows.  However, due to efficient use of water and detergent, the sudsing issue with front-loaders can be controlled by simply using less detergent, without lessening cleaning action.\n\n===Rinsing===\nWashing machines perform several rinses after the main wash to remove most of the [[detergent]]. Modern washing machines use less [[water]] due to [[environmental concern]]s; however, this has led to the problem of poor rinsing on many washing machines on the [[Market (economics)|market]],<ref name=\"whitegoodshelp1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whitegoodshelp.co.uk/wordpress/why-cant-modern-washing-machines-rinse-properly/ |title=Why can't modern washing machines rinse properly? |publisher=Whitegoodshelp.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-02-16}}</ref> which can be a problem to people who are [[Allergy|sensitive]] to [[detergent]]s. The [[Allergy UK]] website suggests re-running the rinse cycle, or rerunning the entire wash cycle without [[detergent]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allergyuk.org/fs_handyhints.aspx |title=Allergy Tips and Advice for Household Cleaning |publisher=Allergyuk.org |date= |accessdate=2010-02-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613062143/http://allergyuk.org/fs_handyhints.aspx |archive-date=2010-06-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn response to complaints, many washing machines allow the user to select additional rinse cycles, at the [[expense]] of higher [[water usage]] and longer cycle time.\n\n===Spinning===\nHigher spin speeds, along with larger tub diameters, remove more water, leading to faster drying. On the other hand, avoid [[ironing]] can be obtained not using spin cycle in the washing machine.\n\nIf a heated [[clothes dryer|clothes-dryer]] is used after the wash and spin, energy use is reduced if more water has been removed from clothes. However, faster spinning can crease clothes more. Also, mechanical wear on bearings increases rapidly with rotational speed, reducing life. Early machines would spin at only 300 rpm and, because of lack of any mechanical suspension, would often shake and vibrate.\n\nIn 1976, most front loading washing machines spun at around 700 rpm, or less.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nSeparate spin-driers, without washing functionality, are available for specialized applications.  For example, a small high-speed [[centrifuge]] machine may be provided in [[locker room]]s of communal [[swimming pool]]s to allow wet [[swimsuit]]s to be substantially dried to a slightly damp condition after daily use.\n\n===Maintenance wash===\nMany home washing machines use a plastic, rather than metal, outer shell to contain the wash water; residue can build up on the plastic tub over time. Some manufacturers advise users to perform a regular maintenance or \"freshening\" wash to clean the inside of the washing machine of any [[mold]], [[bacteria]], encrusted detergent, and unspecified dirt more effectively than with a normal wash.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nA maintenance wash is performed without any laundry, on the hottest wash program if there is a heater,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washerhelp.co.uk/usage_2.html |title=Washing machine usage (part 2) |publisher=Washerhelp.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-02-16}}</ref> adding substances such as [[white vinegar]], 100 grams of [[citric acid]], a detergent with bleaching properties, or a proprietary washing machine cleaner.

All else being equal, a machine of higher capacity will cost more to buy, but will be more convenient if large amounts of laundry must be cleaned. Fewer runs of a machine of larger capacity may have lower running costs and better energy and [[water efficiency]] than frequent use of a smaller machine, particularly for large families. Running a large machine with small loads is wasteful.\n\nFor many years energy and water efficiency were not regulated, and little attention was paid to them. From the last part of the twentieth century increasing attention was paid to efficiency, with regulations enforcing some standards, and efficiency being a selling point, both to save on running costs and to reduce [[carbon dioxide]] emissions associated with energy generation, and waste of water.\n\nAs energy and water efficiency became regulated, they became a selling point, however, the effectiveness of rinsing was not regulated, and it didn't directly become a selling point. Therefore, manufacturers tended to reduce the degree of rinsing after washing, saving water and motor energy. This had the side-effect of leaving more detergent residue in clothes. Insufficient rinsing can leave enough detergent in clothes to affect people with allergies or sensitivity.<ref name=\"whitegoodshelp1\"/>\n\n===Europe===\n[[File:Energy label en.svg|thumb|upright|The EU requires washing machines carry an efficiency label]]\nWashing machines display an [[EU Energy Label]] with grades for energy efficiency, washing performance and spin efficiency. Grades for energy efficiency run from A+++ to G (best to worst), providing a simple method for judging running costs. Washing performance and spin efficiency are graded in the range A to G. However, all machines for sale must have washing performance A, such that manufacturers cannot compromise washing performance in order to improve the energy efficiency. This labeling has had the desired effect of driving customers toward more efficient washing machines and away from less efficient ones.\n\nThe TopTenEU and other national TopTen European organizations provide independent recommendations for high efficient washing machines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.topten.eu/english/criteria/washing-machines-2.html&fromid= |title=Selection criteria washing machines |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425102236/http://www.topten.eu/english/criteria/washing-machines-2.html%26fromid%3D |archive-date=April 25, 2016 |publisher=TopTenEU}}</ref>\n\nAccording to newer [[regulation]]s, each washing machine is equipped with a waste water filter. There are two reasons for that. On one hand it has to be ensured that no hazardous [[chemical substance]]s are disposed of improperly through the waste water channel; on the other hand it must also be ensured that in case of a backwards shear in the waste water channel that is possible in case of technical problems, the [[feces]] and other [[waste]] could not enter the washing machine.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|isbn = 978-3-906484-57-0|url = http://www.eawag.ch/forschung/sandec/publikationen/compendium_e/index_EN|title = Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies |edition=2nd |author= Tilley, E. |author2=Ulrich, L. |author3=L\u00fcthi, C. |author4=Reymond, Ph. |author5=Zurbr\u00fcgg, C.|publisher = Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag) |location=Duebendorf, Switzerland|page = 147|year = 2014}}</ref>\n\n===United States===\nTop-loading and front-loading clothes washers are covered by a single Federal Standard regulating energy consumption.

They are built with large easy-to-open service covers, and washers are designed not to require access to the underside for service. Often commercial washers are installed in long rows with a wide access passageway behind all the machines to allow maintenance without moving the heavy machines.\n\n===Laundromat machines===\nMany commercial washers are built for use by the general public, and are installed in publicly accessible [[laundromat]]s or laundrettes, operated by [[currency acceptor|money accepting devices]] or [[Magnetic stripe card|card readers]]. The features of a commercial laundromat washer are more limited than a consumer washer, usually offering just two or three basic wash programs and an option to choose wash cycle temperatures.\n\nThe common front-loading commercial washing machine also differs from consumer models in its expulsion of wash and rinse water. While the consumer models [[pump]] used washer water out, allowing the waste line to be located above the washer, front loading commercial machines generally use only [[gravity]] to expel used water. A drain in the rear, at the bottom of the machine opens at the appointed time during the cycle and water flows out. This creates the need for a drainage trough behind machines, which leads to a filter and drain. The trough is usually part of a cement platform built for the purpose of raising the machines to a convenient height,  and can be seen behind washers at most laundromats.\n\nMost laundromat machines are horizontal-axis front-loading models, because of their lower operating costs (notably lower consumption of expensive hot water).\n\n===Industrial washers===\n<!-- [[File:Lapauw Combi 2000.jpg|thumb|A 1980s Belgian {{convert|180|kg|0|abbr=on}} load industrial washer in a Hotel in Brussels (horizontal axis, front load)]] -->\n[[File:Lapauw Combi 1000.jpg|thumb|upright|A 1980s Belgian {{nowrap|90 kg}} load industrial washer (horizontal axis, front load)]]\nBy contrast, commercial washers for ''internal'' business operations (still often referred to as \"washer/extractor\" machines) may include features absent from domestic machines. Many commercial washers offer an option for automatic injection of five or more different chemical types, so that the operator does not have to deal with constantly measuring out soap products and fabric softeners for each load by hand. Instead, a precise metering system draws the detergents and wash additives directly from large liquid-chemical storage barrels and injects them as needed into the various wash and rinse cycles. Some computer-controlled commercial washers offer the operator  control over the various wash and rinse cycles, allowing the operator to program custom washing cycles.\n\nMost large-scale industrial washers are horizontal-axis machines, but may have front-, side-, or top-load doors. Some industrial clothes washers can batch-process up to {{convert|800|lb}} of textiles at once, and can be used for extremely machine-abusive washing tasks such as [[stone washing]] or fabric [[bleaching]] and [[dyeing]].\n\nAn industrial washer can be mounted on heavy-duty [[shock absorbers]] and attached to a concrete floor, so that it can extract water from even the most severely out-of-balance and heavy wash loads. Noise and vibration is not as unacceptable as in a domestic machine. It may be mounted on [[hydraulic cylinders]], permitting the entire washer to be lifted and tilted so that fabrics can be automatically dumped from the wash drum onto a [[conveyor belt]] once the cycle is complete. \n \nOne special type of continuous-processing washer is known as the [[tunnel washer]].

It often involves armed gangs from one community seeking out defenseless persons or whole families in their homes, slashing and cutting up the male members and sometimes the female members, and raping the latter, and burning all alive including the children. A second source is police killings, which account for a large number of deaths in several major riots for which figures have been provided by inquiry commission reports, and which cannot be justified in terms of \"crowd control\". These killings are disproportionately of Muslims.}}{{sfn|Riaz|2008|p=165|ps=: \"Violence perpetrated against Muslims is now naturalized: riots are 'well-known and accepted transgression of routine political behavior in India.' ...

In particular, scholars fault the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) and the [[Shiv Sena]] for complicity in these incidents of violence{{sfn|Brass|b}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2011|p=376}}{{sfn|Sarkur|2007|p=187}}{{sfn|Brekke|2012|pp=86\u201387}} and of using violence against Muslims as a part of a larger electoral strategy.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2011|p=376}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2011|p=382}} For example, research by Raheel Dhattiwala and Michael Biggs has stated that killings are far higher in areas where the BJP faces stiff electoral opposition than in areas in which it is already strong.{{sfn|Dhattiwala|2012|pp=483\u2013516}} In 1989, the north of India saw an increase in orchestrated attacks on Muslims, and the BJP had further success in the local and state elections.{{sfn|Chandavarkar|2009|p=114}} The [[social anthropologist]] [[Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah]] concludes that the violence in [[Bhagalpur]] in [[1989 Bhagalpur violence|1989]], Hashimpura in [[Hashimpura massacre|1987]] and in [[Moradabad]] [[1980 Moradabad riots|1980]] were organised killings.{{sfn|Tambiah|1997|p=321}} According to [[Ram Puniyani]], the Shiv Sena  were victorious in the elections due to the violence in the 1990s, and the BJP in Gujarat after the 2002 violence.{{sfn|Puniyan|2003|pp=12\u201313}} [[Gyan Prakash]], however, cautions that the BJP's actions in Gujarat do not equate to the entirety of India, and it remains to be seen if the [[Hindutva]] movement has been successful in the deployment of this strategy nationwide.{{sfn|Prakash|2007|pp=177\u2013179}}\n\n===Economic and cultural factors===\nHindu nationalists use the historical [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|subjugation]] of India by Muslims as an excuse for violence. They feel that, since the Partition, Indian Muslims are [[Pro-Pakistan sentiment|allied to Pakistan]] and are possibly radicalised  and, therefore, the Hindus must take defensive steps to avoid repeat of the past wrongs and reassert their pride.{{Original research inline|date=August 2015}}{{sfn|Etzion|2008|pp=123\u2013124}} The higher fertility rate among Muslims has been a recurring theme in the Hindu Right's rhetoric. They claim that the [[Islam in India#Population growth rate|higher]] birth rate among Muslims is part of a plan to turn the Hindus into a minority within their own country.{{Original research inline|date=August 2015}}{{sfn|Weigl|2012|p=19}}\n\nAnother reason given for these outbreaks of violence is the upward mobility of the [[Caste system in India|lower castes]] caused by the expansion of the economy. The violence has become a substitute for class tensions.  Nationalists, rather than deal with the claims from the lower class, instead view Muslims and Christians as not \"fully Indian\" due to their religion,{{sfn|Metcalf|2006|p=89}} and portray those who carry out these attacks as \"heroes\" that defended the majority from \"anti-nationals\".{{sfn|Puniyan|2003|pp=12\u201313}} Muslims are viewed as suspect and their loyalty to the state is questioned because of the ill-will still prevalent after the violence during [[Partition of India|partition]]. According to [[Omar Khalidi]]:\n\n<blockquote>Anti-Muslim violence is planned and executed to render Muslims economically and socially crippled and, as a final outcome of that economic and social backwardness, assimilating them into lower rungs of Hindu society.{{sfn|Puniyan|2003|p=153}}</blockquote>\n\n[[Cultural nationalism]] has also been given as a reason for instances of violence carried out by [[Shiv Sena]] which initially claimed to speak for the people of [[Maharashtra]], but quickly turned their [[rhetoric]] to inciting violence against Muslims. The Shiv Sena were complicit in the violence in 1984 in the town of [[Bhiwandi]], and again in the violence in [[Mumbai|Bombay]] in 1992 and 1993.{{sfn|Chandavarkar|2009|p=29}} Violence has been incited by Sena in 1971 and 1986.{{sfn|Kaur|2005|p=160}}{{sfn|Chandavarkar|2009|p=114}}  According to [[Sudipta Kaviraj]], the [[Vishva Hindu Parishad]] (VHP) are still engaged in the religious conflicts which began in the medieval times.{{sfn|Kaviraj|2010|p=245}}\n\nAnti-Muslim violence creates a security risk for Hindus residing outside of India. Since the 1950s, there have been retaliatory attacks on Hindus in Pakistan and [[Bangladesh]] in response to anti-Muslim violence in India. After the 1992 violence in Bombay, Hindu temples were attacked in [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Dubai]] and [[Thailand]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|2006|p=16}} This recurring violence has become a rigidly conventional pattern which has created a divide between the Muslim and Hindu communities.{{sfn|Shani|2007|p=187}}\n\n[[Jamaat-e-Islami Hind]] has spoken out against these communal clashes, as it believes that the violence not only impacts upon Muslims, but India as a whole, and that these riots are damaging to India's progress.{{sfn|Sikand|2004|p=86}} In Gujarat, the [[Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act]] (TADA) was used in incidents pertaining to communal violence in 1992 and 1993.  The majority of those arrested under the act were Muslim.  Conversely, TADA was not used after the violence carried out against Muslims during the [[Bombay riots]].{{sfn|Singh|2012|p=427}}\n\n===Demographics===\nThe BJP politicians, as well as those of other parties, argue that [[demographics]] play an essential role in Indian elections. The BJP believe that the higher the number of Muslims within a constituency, the higher are the chances of centrist parties  to acquiesce to minority groups' requests, which lowers the chances of Muslims \"building bridges\" with their Hindu neighbours.  As such, according to this argument \"Muslim appeasement\" is the root cause of communal violence.{{sfn|Varshney|2003|p=8}} Susanne and Lloyd Rudolph argue that the economic disparity is a reason for the aggression shown towards Muslims by Hindus.

It often involves armed gangs from one community seeking out defenseless persons or whole families in their homes, slashing and cutting up the male members and sometimes the female members, and raping the latter, and burning all alive including the children. A second source is police killings, which account for a large number of deaths in several major riots for which figures have been provided by inquiry commission reports, and which cannot be justified in terms of \"crowd control\". These killings are disproportionately of Muslims.}}{{sfn|Riaz|2008|p=165|ps=: \"Violence perpetrated against Muslims is now naturalized: riots are 'well-known and accepted transgression of routine political behavior in India.' ...

In particular, scholars fault the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) and the [[Shiv Sena]] for complicity in these incidents of violence{{sfn|Brass|b}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2011|p=376}}{{sfn|Sarkur|2007|p=187}}{{sfn|Brekke|2012|pp=86\u201387}} and of using violence against Muslims as a part of a larger electoral strategy.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2011|p=376}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2011|p=382}} For example, research by Raheel Dhattiwala and Michael Biggs has stated that killings are far higher in areas where the BJP faces stiff electoral opposition than in areas in which it is already strong.{{sfn|Dhattiwala|2012|pp=483\u2013516}} In 1989, the north of India saw an increase in orchestrated attacks on Muslims, and the BJP had further success in the local and state elections.{{sfn|Chandavarkar|2009|p=114}} The [[social anthropologist]] [[Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah]] concludes that the violence in [[Bhagalpur]] in [[1989 Bhagalpur violence|1989]], Hashimpura in [[Hashimpura massacre|1987]] and in [[Moradabad]] [[1980 Moradabad riots|1980]] were organised killings.{{sfn|Tambiah|1997|p=321}} According to [[Ram Puniyani]], the Shiv Sena  were victorious in the elections due to the violence in the 1990s, and the BJP in Gujarat after the 2002 violence.{{sfn|Puniyan|2003|pp=12\u201313}} [[Gyan Prakash]], however, cautions that the BJP's actions in Gujarat do not equate to the entirety of India, and it remains to be seen if the [[Hindutva]] movement has been successful in the deployment of this strategy nationwide.{{sfn|Prakash|2007|pp=177\u2013179}}\n\n===Economic and cultural factors===\nHindu nationalists use the historical [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|subjugation]] of India by Muslims as an excuse for violence. They feel that, since the Partition, Indian Muslims are [[Pro-Pakistan sentiment|allied to Pakistan]] and are possibly radicalised  and, therefore, the Hindus must take defensive steps to avoid repeat of the past wrongs and reassert their pride.{{Original research inline|date=August 2015}}{{sfn|Etzion|2008|pp=123\u2013124}} The higher fertility rate among Muslims has been a recurring theme in the Hindu Right's rhetoric. They claim that the [[Islam in India#Population growth rate|higher]] birth rate among Muslims is part of a plan to turn the Hindus into a minority within their own country.{{Original research inline|date=August 2015}}{{sfn|Weigl|2012|p=19}}\n\nAnother reason given for these outbreaks of violence is the upward mobility of the [[Caste system in India|lower castes]] caused by the expansion of the economy. The violence has become a substitute for class tensions.  Nationalists, rather than deal with the claims from the lower class, instead view Muslims and Christians as not \"fully Indian\" due to their religion,{{sfn|Metcalf|2006|p=89}} and portray those who carry out these attacks as \"heroes\" that defended the majority from \"anti-nationals\".{{sfn|Puniyan|2003|pp=12\u201313}} Muslims are viewed as suspect and their loyalty to the state is questioned because of the ill-will still prevalent after the violence during [[Partition of India|partition]]. According to [[Omar Khalidi]]:\n\n<blockquote>Anti-Muslim violence is planned and executed to render Muslims economically and socially crippled and, as a final outcome of that economic and social backwardness, assimilating them into lower rungs of Hindu society.{{sfn|Puniyan|2003|p=153}}</blockquote>\n\n[[Cultural nationalism]] has also been given as a reason for instances of violence carried out by [[Shiv Sena]] which initially claimed to speak for the people of [[Maharashtra]], but quickly turned their [[rhetoric]] to inciting violence against Muslims. The Shiv Sena were complicit in the violence in 1984 in the town of [[Bhiwandi]], and again in the violence in [[Mumbai|Bombay]] in 1992 and 1993.{{sfn|Chandavarkar|2009|p=29}} Violence has been incited by Sena in 1971 and 1986.{{sfn|Kaur|2005|p=160}}{{sfn|Chandavarkar|2009|p=114}}  According to [[Sudipta Kaviraj]], the [[Vishva Hindu Parishad]] (VHP) are still engaged in the religious conflicts which began in the medieval times.{{sfn|Kaviraj|2010|p=245}}\n\nAnti-Muslim violence creates a security risk for Hindus residing outside of India. Since the 1950s, there have been retaliatory attacks on Hindus in Pakistan and [[Bangladesh]] in response to anti-Muslim violence in India. After the 1992 violence in Bombay, Hindu temples were attacked in [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Dubai]] and [[Thailand]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|2006|p=16}} This recurring violence has become a rigidly conventional pattern which has created a divide between the Muslim and Hindu communities.{{sfn|Shani|2007|p=187}}\n\n[[Jamaat-e-Islami Hind]] has spoken out against these communal clashes, as it believes that the violence not only impacts upon Muslims, but India as a whole, and that these riots are damaging to India's progress.{{sfn|Sikand|2004|p=86}} In Gujarat, the [[Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act]] (TADA) was used in incidents pertaining to communal violence in 1992 and 1993.  The majority of those arrested under the act were Muslim.  Conversely, TADA was not used after the violence carried out against Muslims during the [[Bombay riots]].{{sfn|Singh|2012|p=427}}\n\n===Demographics===\nThe BJP politicians, as well as those of other parties, argue that [[demographics]] play an essential role in Indian elections. The BJP believe that the higher the number of Muslims within a constituency, the higher are the chances of centrist parties  to acquiesce to minority groups' requests, which lowers the chances of Muslims \"building bridges\" with their Hindu neighbours.  As such, according to this argument \"Muslim appeasement\" is the root cause of communal violence.{{sfn|Varshney|2003|p=8}} Susanne and Lloyd Rudolph argue that the economic disparity is a reason for the aggression shown towards Muslims by Hindus. As India's economy expanded due to [[globalization]] and [[investment]] from overseas companies, the expectations of the Hindu population were not matched by the opportunities. Hindu nationalists then encouraged the perception of Muslims as the source of the Hindus' troubles.{{sfn|Price|2012|p=95}}\n\nThe actions of anti-Hindu and [[Insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir|anti-India militant groups]] in [[Kashmir conflict|Kashmir]] and Pakistan have reinforced anti-Muslim feelings in India, which has strengthened the Hindu Right. The [[Hindutva]] discourse portrays Muslims as traitors and state enemies, whose patriotism is suspected.{{sfn|Sikand|2006|p=88}} [[Sumit Ganguly]] argues that the rise in terrorism cannot only be attributed to [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] factors, but also to the violence perpetrated by Hindutva forces.{{sfn|Ganguly|2003|p=10}}\n\n==Major incidents==\n\n===1964 Kolkata===\nRiots between [[Hindu]]s and [[Muslim]]s had left over a hundred people dead, 438 people were injured. Over 7000 people were arrested. 70,000 Muslims have fled their homes and 55,000 were provided protection by the [[Indian army]]. Muslims in Kolkata became more ghettoized than ever before in the aftermath of this riot. The riot was believed to be instigated by violence against Hindus in [[East Pakistan]] (now Bangladesh) and the flow of refugees from there.

Red wigglers are recommended by most vermicomposting experts, as they have some of the best appetites and breed very quickly. Users refer to European nightcrawlers by a variety of other names, including ''dendrobaenas'', ''dendras'', Dutch nightcrawlers, and Belgian nightcrawlers.\n\nContaining water-soluble nutrients, vermicompost is a nutrient-rich [[organic fertilizer]] and soil conditioner in a form that is relatively easy for plants to absorb.<ref name=\"Coyne 2008\"/> Worm castings are sometimes used as an organic fertilizer. Because the earthworms grind and uniformly mix minerals in simple forms, plants need only minimal effort to obtain them. The worms' digestive systems create environments that allow certain species of microbes to thrive to help create a \"living\" soil environment for plants.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=C.A.|title=Earthworm Ecology|date=1998|publisher=CRC Press LLC|isbn=978-1-884015-74-8|pages=189}}</ref> The fraction of soil which has gone through the digestive tract of earthworms is called the [[drilosphere]].<ref>Organic Phosphorus in the Environment, Turner, ''et al.'', Page 91. 2005</ref>\n\n==Design considerations==\n===Suitable worm species===\nOne of the species most often used for composting is the red wiggler or tiger worm (''Eisenia fetida'' or ''Eisenia andrei''); ''[[Lumbricus rubellus]]'' (a.k.a. red earthworm or dilong (China)) is another breed of worm that can be used, but it does not adapt as well to the shallow compost bin as does ''Eisenia fetida''. European nightcrawlers (''Eisenia hortensis'') may also be used. Users refer to European nightcrawlers by a variety of other names, including dendrobaenas, dendras, and nightcrawlers.  African Nightcrawlers (''[[Eudrilus eugeniae]]'') are another set of popular composters. ''[[Lumbricus terrestris]]'' (a.k.a. Canadian nightcrawlers (US) or common earthworm (UK)) are not recommended, since they burrow deeper than most compost bins can accommodate.<ref name=\"thf\">{{cite web | url=http://herronfarms.webs.com/ | title=Composting with earthworms| publisher=Herron Farms Dawsonville Ga. | accessdate=March 26, 2013}}</ref>\n\nBlueworms (''[[Perionyx excavatus]]'') may be used in the tropics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/oc/freepubs/pdf/HG-46.pdf |title=Composting Worms for Hawaii |accessdate=2009-02-22}}</ref>\n\nThese species commonly are found in organic-rich soils throughout Europe and North America and live in rotting [[vegetation]], compost, and [[manure]] piles. They may be an [[invasive species]] in some areas.<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nrri.umn.edu/worms/ |title=Great Lakes Worm Watch |accessdate=2009-02-22}}</ref> As they are shallow-dwelling and feed on decomposing plant matter in the soil, they adapt easily to living on food or plant waste in the confines of a worm bin.\n\nComposting worms are available to order online, from nursery mail-order suppliers or [[angling]] shops where they are sold as [[Bait (luring substance)|bait]]. They can also be collected from compost and manure piles. These species are not the same worms that are found in ordinary soil or on pavement when the soil is flooded by water.\n\n===Large scale===\nLarge-scale vermicomposting is practiced in Canada, Italy, Japan, India, Malaysia, the Philippines, and the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1873/5a709af9fea979c004e281d9f41c0e7bdc90.pdf |title=Vermicomposting: A Better Option for Organic Solid Waste Management |accessdate=2009-02-21 }}</ref>  The vermicompost may be used for farming, landscaping, to create [[compost tea]], or for sale. Some of these operations produce worms for bait and/or home vermicomposting.\n\nThere are two main methods of large-scale vermiculture. Some systems use a [[windrow]], which consists of bedding materials for the earthworms to live in and acts as a large bin; organic material is added to it. Although the windrow has no physical barriers to prevent worms from escaping, in theory they should not due to an abundance of organic matter for them to feed on. Often windrows are used on a concrete surface to prevent predators from gaining access to the worm population.\n\nThe [[Windrow composting|windrow method]] and compost windrow turners were developed by Fletcher Sims Jr. of the Compost Corporation in Canyon, Texas. The Windrow Composting system is noted as a sustainable, cost-efficient way for farmers to manage dairy waste.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Windrow composting systems can be {{sic|nolink=y|feasable}}, cost effective (Research Brief #20) {{!}} Center for Integrated Agricultural Systems|url = http://www.cias.wisc.edu/windrow-composting-systems-can-be-feasable-cost-effective/|website = www.cias.wisc.edu|access-date = 2016-02-21}}</ref>\n[[File:Worm bed wave.svg|thumb|350px|Movement of castings through a worm bed]]\n\nThe second type of large-scale vermicomposting system is the raised bed or flow-through system. Here the worms are fed an inch of \"worm chow\" across the top of the bed, and an inch of castings are harvested from below by pulling a breaker bar across the large mesh screen which forms the base of the bed.\n\nBecause red worms are surface dwellers constantly moving towards the new food source, the flow-through system eliminates the need to separate worms from the castings before packaging. Flow-through systems are well suited to indoor facilities, making them the preferred choice for operations in colder climates.\n\n===Small scale===\n[[File:Wormbin.sample.jpg|thumb|right|Demonstration home scale worm bin at a community garden site (painted [[plywood]])]]\n[[File:Wormbin.jpg|thumb|Diagram of a household-scale worm composting bin]]\nFor vermicomposting at home, a large variety of bins are commercially available, or a variety of adapted containers may be used. They may be made of old plastic containers, wood, [[Styrofoam]], or metal containers. The design of a small bin usually depends on where an individual wishes to store the bin and how they wish to feed the worms.\n\nSome materials are less desirable than others in worm bin construction. Metal containers often conduct heat too readily, are prone to rusting, and may release [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]]s into the vermicompost. Styrofoam containers may release chemicals into the organic material.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Worm Compost Bins - What To Look For and What To Avoid|url = http://www.best-organic-fertilizer.com/worm-compost-bins.html|website = www.best-organic-fertilizer.com|access-date = 2016-02-21}}</ref> Some [[Cedrus|cedars]], [[yellow cedar]], and [[Coast Redwood|redwood]] contain resinous oils that may harm worms,<ref name=raising>{{cite web |url=http://www.p2pays.org/ref/35/34577.pdf |title=Raising Earthworms Successfully |accessdate=2009-03-04}}</ref> although [[Western Red Cedar|western red cedar]] has excellent longevity in composting conditions.

However, wooden bins will eventually decay and need to be replaced.\n\nSmall-scale vermicomposting is well-suited to turn kitchen waste into high-quality [[soil amendment]]s, where space is limited. Worms can decompose organic matter without the additional human physical effort (turning the bin) that [[composting|bin composting]] requires.\n\nComposting worms which are detritivorous (eaters of trash), such as the red wiggler ''Eisenia fetidae'', are epigeic (surface dwellers) and together with symbiotic associated microbes are the ideal vectors for decomposing food waste. Common earthworms such as ''Lumbricus terrestris'' are anecic (deep burrowing) species and hence unsuitable for use in a closed system.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Worm Dictionary and Vermiculture Reference Center|url=http://www.working-worms.com/content/view/43/68/#d|publisher=Working Worms|accessdate=3 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028160939/http://www.working-worms.com/content/view/43/68/#d|archive-date=28 October 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Other soil species that contribute include [[insect]]s, other worms and [[Mold (fungus)|mold]]s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Trautmann |first=Nancy |url=http://compost.css.cornell.edu/invertebrates.html |title=Invertebrates of the Compost Pile |publisher=Cornell Center for the Environment |accessdate=2012-10-03}}</ref>\n\n===Climate and temperature===\nThere may be differences in vermicomposting method depending on the climate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gardeningknowhow.com/composting/vermicomposting/hot-climate-vermiculture.htm|title=High Heat And Worm Bins \u2013 Tips For Vermicomposting When It's Hot|website=Gardening Know How|language=en-US|access-date=2016-02-21}}</ref> It is necessary to monitor the temperatures of large-scale bin systems (which can have high [[Heat capacity|heat-retentive]] properties), as the raw materials or [[feedstock]]s used can [[compost]], heating up the worm bins as they decay and killing the worms.\n\nThe most common worms used in composting systems, redworms (''[[Eisenia foetida]],'' ''[[Eisenia andrei]],'' and ''[[Lumbricus rubellus]]'') feed most rapidly at temperatures of 15\u201325&nbsp;\u00b0C (59-77&nbsp;\u00b0F).

Red wigglers are recommended by most vermicomposting experts, as they have some of the best appetites and breed very quickly. Users refer to European nightcrawlers by a variety of other names, including ''dendrobaenas'', ''dendras'', Dutch nightcrawlers, and Belgian nightcrawlers.\n\nContaining water-soluble nutrients, vermicompost is a nutrient-rich [[organic fertilizer]] and soil conditioner in a form that is relatively easy for plants to absorb.<ref name=\"Coyne 2008\"/> Worm castings are sometimes used as an organic fertilizer. Because the earthworms grind and uniformly mix minerals in simple forms, plants need only minimal effort to obtain them. The worms' digestive systems create environments that allow certain species of microbes to thrive to help create a \"living\" soil environment for plants.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=C.A.|title=Earthworm Ecology|date=1998|publisher=CRC Press LLC|isbn=978-1-884015-74-8|pages=189}}</ref> The fraction of soil which has gone through the digestive tract of earthworms is called the [[drilosphere]].<ref>Organic Phosphorus in the Environment, Turner, ''et al.'', Page 91. 2005</ref>\n\n==Design considerations==\n===Suitable worm species===\nOne of the species most often used for composting is the red wiggler or tiger worm (''Eisenia fetida'' or ''Eisenia andrei''); ''[[Lumbricus rubellus]]'' (a.k.a. red earthworm or dilong (China)) is another breed of worm that can be used, but it does not adapt as well to the shallow compost bin as does ''Eisenia fetida''. European nightcrawlers (''Eisenia hortensis'') may also be used. Users refer to European nightcrawlers by a variety of other names, including dendrobaenas, dendras, and nightcrawlers.  African Nightcrawlers (''[[Eudrilus eugeniae]]'') are another set of popular composters. ''[[Lumbricus terrestris]]'' (a.k.a.

They can also be collected from compost and manure piles. These species are not the same worms that are found in ordinary soil or on pavement when the soil is flooded by water.\n\n===Large scale===\nLarge-scale vermicomposting is practiced in Canada, Italy, Japan, India, Malaysia, the Philippines, and the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1873/5a709af9fea979c004e281d9f41c0e7bdc90.pdf |title=Vermicomposting: A Better Option for Organic Solid Waste Management |accessdate=2009-02-21 }}</ref>  The vermicompost may be used for farming, landscaping, to create [[compost tea]], or for sale. Some of these operations produce worms for bait and/or home vermicomposting.\n\nThere are two main methods of large-scale vermiculture. Some systems use a [[windrow]], which consists of bedding materials for the earthworms to live in and acts as a large bin; organic material is added to it. Although the windrow has no physical barriers to prevent worms from escaping, in theory they should not due to an abundance of organic matter for them to feed on. Often windrows are used on a concrete surface to prevent predators from gaining access to the worm population.\n\nThe [[Windrow composting|windrow method]] and compost windrow turners were developed by Fletcher Sims Jr. of the Compost Corporation in Canyon, Texas. The Windrow Composting system is noted as a sustainable, cost-efficient way for farmers to manage dairy waste.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Windrow composting systems can be {{sic|nolink=y|feasable}}, cost effective (Research Brief #20) {{!}} Center for Integrated Agricultural Systems|url = http://www.cias.wisc.edu/windrow-composting-systems-can-be-feasable-cost-effective/|website = www.cias.wisc.edu|access-date = 2016-02-21}}</ref>\n[[File:Worm bed wave.svg|thumb|350px|Movement of castings through a worm bed]]\n\nThe second type of large-scale vermicomposting system is the raised bed or flow-through system. Here the worms are fed an inch of \"worm chow\" across the top of the bed, and an inch of castings are harvested from below by pulling a breaker bar across the large mesh screen which forms the base of the bed.\n\nBecause red worms are surface dwellers constantly moving towards the new food source, the flow-through system eliminates the need to separate worms from the castings before packaging. Flow-through systems are well suited to indoor facilities, making them the preferred choice for operations in colder climates.\n\n===Small scale===\n[[File:Wormbin.sample.jpg|thumb|right|Demonstration home scale worm bin at a community garden site (painted [[plywood]])]]\n[[File:Wormbin.jpg|thumb|Diagram of a household-scale worm composting bin]]\nFor vermicomposting at home, a large variety of bins are commercially available, or a variety of adapted containers may be used. They may be made of old plastic containers, wood, [[Styrofoam]], or metal containers. The design of a small bin usually depends on where an individual wishes to store the bin and how they wish to feed the worms.\n\nSome materials are less desirable than others in worm bin construction. Metal containers often conduct heat too readily, are prone to rusting, and may release [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]]s into the vermicompost. Styrofoam containers may release chemicals into the organic material.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Worm Compost Bins - What To Look For and What To Avoid|url = http://www.best-organic-fertilizer.com/worm-compost-bins.html|website = www.best-organic-fertilizer.com|access-date = 2016-02-21}}</ref> Some [[Cedrus|cedars]], [[yellow cedar]], and [[Coast Redwood|redwood]] contain resinous oils that may harm worms,<ref name=raising>{{cite web |url=http://www.p2pays.org/ref/35/34577.pdf |title=Raising Earthworms Successfully |accessdate=2009-03-04}}</ref> although [[Western Red Cedar|western red cedar]] has excellent longevity in composting conditions.

However, wooden bins will eventually decay and need to be replaced.\n\nSmall-scale vermicomposting is well-suited to turn kitchen waste into high-quality [[soil amendment]]s, where space is limited. Worms can decompose organic matter without the additional human physical effort (turning the bin) that [[composting|bin composting]] requires.\n\nComposting worms which are detritivorous (eaters of trash), such as the red wiggler ''Eisenia fetidae'', are epigeic (surface dwellers) and together with symbiotic associated microbes are the ideal vectors for decomposing food waste. Common earthworms such as ''Lumbricus terrestris'' are anecic (deep burrowing) species and hence unsuitable for use in a closed system.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Worm Dictionary and Vermiculture Reference Center|url=http://www.working-worms.com/content/view/43/68/#d|publisher=Working Worms|accessdate=3 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028160939/http://www.working-worms.com/content/view/43/68/#d|archive-date=28 October 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Other soil species that contribute include [[insect]]s, other worms and [[mold]]s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Trautmann |first=Nancy |url=http://compost.css.cornell.edu/invertebrates.html |title=Invertebrates of the Compost Pile |publisher=Cornell Center for the Environment |accessdate=2012-10-03}}</ref>\n\n===Climate and temperature===\nThere may be differences in vermicomposting method depending on the climate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gardeningknowhow.com/composting/vermicomposting/hot-climate-vermiculture.htm|title=High Heat And Worm Bins \u2013 Tips For Vermicomposting When It's Hot|website=Gardening Know How|language=en-US|access-date=2016-02-21}}</ref> It is necessary to monitor the temperatures of large-scale bin systems (which can have high [[Heat capacity|heat-retentive]] properties), as the raw materials or [[feedstock]]s used can [[compost]], heating up the worm bins as they decay and killing the worms.\n\nThe most common worms used in composting systems, redworms (''[[Eisenia foetida]],'' ''[[Eisenia andrei]],'' and ''[[Lumbricus rubellus]]'') feed most rapidly at temperatures of 15\u201325&nbsp;\u00b0C (59-77&nbsp;\u00b0F).

If decomposition becomes anaerobic from excess wet feedstock added to the bin, or the layers of food waste have become too deep, the bin will begin to smell of [[ammonia]].\n\n===Moisture===\nMoisture must be maintained above 50%, as lower moisture content will not support worm respiration and can increase worm mortality.

This problem can be avoided by thoroughly covering the waste by at least {{convert|5|cm|in}} of bedding.

Because the small-scale and home systems use a varied mix of feedstocks, the nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium  (NPK) content of the resulting vermicompost will also be inconsistent. NPK testing may be helpful before the vermicompost or tea is applied to the garden.\n\nIn order to avoid over-fertilization issues, such as [[nitrogen burn]], vermicompost can be diluted as a tea 50:50 with water, or as a solid can be mixed in 50:50 with [[potting soil]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Grant|first=Tim|last2=Littlejohn|first2=Gail|title=Teaching Green, The Middle Years |year=2004|publisher=New Society Publishers|location=Gabriola Island, B.C.|isbn=978-0-86571-501-1 |page=121 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v46QjUMYuxkC&pg=PT114}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, the mucous layer created by worms which surrounds their castings allows for a \"time release\" effect, meaning not all nutrients are released at once.

The boundaries of the Roman city were similar to those of the City of London today, though the City extends further west than Londonium's [[Ludgate]], and the Thames was undredged and thus wider than it is today, with Londonium's shoreline slightly north of the City's present shoreline. The Romans built a bridge across the river, as early as AD 50, near to today's [[London Bridge]].\n\n=== Decline ===\nBy the time the [[London Wall]] was constructed, the City's fortunes were in decline, and it faced problems of plague and fire. The Roman Empire entered a long period of [[Decline of the Roman Empire|instability and decline]], including the [[Carausian Revolt]] in Britain. In the 3rd and 4th centuries, the city was under attack from [[Picts]], Scots, and [[Saxons|Saxon]] raiders. The decline continued, both for Londinium and the Empire, and in AD 410 the Romans withdrew entirely from Britain. Many of the Roman public buildings in Londinium by this time had fallen into decay and disuse, and gradually after the formal withdrawal the city became almost (if not, at times, entirely) uninhabited. The centre of trade and population moved away from the walled Londinium to [[Lundenwic]] (\"London market\"), a settlement to the west, roughly in the modern day [[Strand, London|Strand]]/[[Aldwych]]/[[Covent Garden]] area.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n=== Anglo-Saxon restoration ===\n\n{{Main|Anglo-Saxon London}}\nDuring the Anglo-Saxon [[Heptarchy]], the London area came in turn under the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Essex|Essex]], [[Mercia]], and later [[Wessex]], though from the mid 8th century it was frequently under the control or threat of the [[Vikings]].\n[[File:Southwark Bridge City Plaque.JPG|left|thumb|Plaque near [[Southwark Bridge]] noting the activities around the time of [[Alfred the Great|King Alfred]].]]\n\n[[Bede]] records that in AD 604 [[Augustine of Canterbury|St Augustine]] consecrated [[Mellitus]] as the first bishop to the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] kingdom of the [[East Saxons]] and their king, [[S\u00e6berht of Essex|S\u00e6berht]].

The refortified Anglo-Saxon settlement was known as [[Lundenburh]] (\"London Fort\", a [[borough]]).

While London, and indeed England, were afterwards subjected to further periods of Viking and Danish raids and occupation, the establishment of the City of London and the [[Kingdom of England]] prevailed.<ref>''London: The Biography'', 2000, [[Peter Ackroyd]], p.&nbsp;33\u201335</ref>\n\nIn the 10th century, [[Athelstan]] permitted eight [[royal mint|mints]] to be established, compared with six in his capital, [[Winchester, Hampshire|Winchester]], indicating the wealth of the city. [[London Bridge]], which had fallen into ruin following the Roman evacuation and abandonment of Londinium, was rebuilt by the Saxons, but was periodically destroyed by Viking raids and storms.\n\nAs the focus of trade and population was moved back to within the old Roman walls, the older Saxon settlement of Lundenwic was largely abandoned and gained the name of ''Ealdwic'' (the \"old settlement\"). The name survives today as [[Aldwych]] (the \"old market-place\"), a name of a street and an area of the [[City of Westminster]] between [[Westminster]] and the City of London.\n\n=== Medieval era ===\n[[File:Map of London, 1300.svg|thumb|right|Map of London in about 1300]]\n[[File:DeathWatTyler.jpg|thumb|right|A pivotal event during the [[Peasants' Revolt]], 1381: their leader [[Wat Tyler]] is stabbed by [[William Walworth]], Lord Mayor]]\n{{See also|Norman and Medieval London}}\nFollowing the [[Battle of Hastings]], [[William the Conqueror]] marched on London ''(reaching as far as [[Southwark]])'', but failed to get across London Bridge or to defeat the Londoners.

Rather than continuing the war, [[Edgar the \u00c6theling]], [[Edwin, Earl of Mercia|Edwin of Mercia]] and [[Morcar]] of Northumbria surrendered at [[Berkhamsted]]. William granted the citizens of London a charter in 1075; the City was one of a few examples of the English retaining some authority. The City was not covered by the [[Domesday Book]].\n\nWilliam built three castles nearby, to keep Londoners subdued:\n\n* [[Tower of London]]\n* [[Baynard's Castle]]\n* [[Montfichet's Tower]]\n\nAbout 1130, [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] granted a [[Shrievalty of London|sheriff]] to the people of London, along with control of the county of [[Middlesex]]: this meant that the two entities were regarded as one administratively (not that the county was a dependency of the City) until the [[Local Government Act 1888]].<ref name=vch_middlesex>[[Victoria County History]]: A history of the County of Middlesex: Vol 2 pp&nbsp;15\u201360 paragraph 12, [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22153] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531055113/http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22153 |date=31 May 2012 }}. Retrieved 2 April 2012</ref> By 1141 the whole body of the citizenry was considered to constitute a single community. This 'commune' was the origin of the [[City of London Corporation]] and the citizens gained the right to appoint, with the king's consent, a mayor in 1189\u2014and to directly elect the mayor from 1215.\n\nFrom medieval times, the City has been composed of [[Wards of the City of London|25 ancient wards]], each headed by an [[alderman]], who chairs [[Wardmote]]s, which still take place at least annually. A [[Folkmoot]], for the whole of the City held at the outdoor cross of [[St Paul's Cathedral]], was formerly also held. Many of the medieval offices and traditions continue to the present day, demonstrating the unique nature of the City and its [[Corporation of London|Corporation]].\n\nIn 1381, the [[Peasants' Revolt]] affected London. The rebels took the City and the Tower of London, but the rebellion ended after its leader, Wat Tyler, was killed during a confrontation that included Lord Mayor [[William Walworth]].\n\n[[File:Civitas Londinium or The Agas Map of London.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Woodcut map of London|\"Woodcut\" map of London]], dating from the 1560s]]\n[[File:Great fire of london map.png|thumb|right|Map showing the extent of the [[Great Fire of London]], which destroyed nearly 80% of the City]]\n[[File:Great Fire London.jpg|thumb|right|The 1666 Great Fire as depicted in a 17th-century painting: it depicts Old London Bridge, churches, houses, and the Tower of London as seen from a boat near Tower Wharf]]\n\nThe City was burnt severely on a number of occasions, the worst being in 1123 and (more famously) in the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666. Both of these fires were referred to as ''the'' Great Fire. After the fire of 1666, a number of plans were drawn up to remodel the City and its street pattern into a [[renaissance]]-style city with planned urban blocks, squares and boulevards. These plans were almost entirely not taken up, and the medieval street pattern re-emerged almost intact.\n\n=== Early modern period ===\nBy the late 16th century, London increasingly became a major centre for banking, international trade and commerce. The [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]] was founded in 1565 by Sir [[Thomas Gresham]] as a centre of commerce for London's merchants, and gained Royal patronage in 1571. Although no longer used for its original purpose, its location at the corner of [[Cornhill, London|Cornhill]] and [[Threadneedle Street]] continues to be the geographical centre of the City's core of banking and financial services, with the [[Bank of England]] moving to its present site in 1734, opposite the Royal Exchange on Threadneedle Street. Immediately to the south of Cornhill, [[Lombard Street, London|Lombard Street]] was the location from 1691 of [[Lloyd's Coffee House]], which became the world-leading insurance market. London's insurance sector continues to be based in the area, particularly in [[Lime Street (ward)|Lime Street]].\n\nIn 1708, [[Christopher Wren]]'s masterpiece, [[St Paul's Cathedral]], was completed on his birthday. The first service had been held on 2 December 1697, more than 10 years earlier. It replaced the original St Paul's, which had been completely destroyed in the Great Fire of London, and is considered to be one of the finest cathedrals in Britain and a fine example of [[Baroque architecture]].\n\n=== Growth of London ===\n\nThe 18th century was a period of rapid growth for [[London]], reflecting an increasing national population, the early stirrings of the [[Industrial Revolution]], and London's role at the centre of the evolving [[British Empire]]. The urban area expanded beyond the borders of the City of London, most notably during this period towards the [[West End of London|West End]] and [[Westminster]].\n\nExpansion continued and became more rapid by the beginning of the 19th century, with London growing in all directions. To the [[East End of London|East]] the [[Port of London]] grew rapidly during the century, with the construction of many docks, needed as the Thames at the City could not cope with the volume of trade. The arrival of the railways and the [[London Underground|Tube]] meant that London could expand over a much greater area. By the mid-19th century, with London still rapidly expanding in population and area, the City had already become only a small part of the wider metropolis.\n\n=== 19th and 20th centuries ===\nAn attempt was made in 1894 with the [[Royal Commission on the Amalgamation of the City and County of London]] to end the distinction between the City and the surrounding County of London, but a change of government at Westminster meant the option was not taken up. The City as a distinct [[polity]] survived despite its position within the London conurbation and [[History of local government in London|numerous local government reforms]]. Supporting this status, the City was a special [[parliamentary borough]] that elected four members to the [[unreformed House of Commons]], who were retained after the [[Reform Act 1832]]; reduced to two under the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885]]; and ceased to be a separate constituency under the [[Representation of the People Act 1948]]. Since then the City is a minority (in terms of population and area) of the [[Cities of London and Westminster]].\n[[File:St Pauls Cathedral in 1896.JPG|thumb|left|[[St Paul's Cathedral]], 1896.]]\n\nThe City's population fell rapidly in the 19th century and through most of the 20th century, as people moved outwards in all directions to London's vast [[Metro-land|suburbs]], and many residential buildings were demolished to make way for office blocks. Like many areas of London and other British cities, the City fell victim to large scale and highly destructive aerial bombing during [[World War II]], especially in [[the Blitz]]. Whilst St Paul's Cathedral survived the onslaught, large swathes of the area did not and the particularly heavy raids of late December 1940 led to a [[firestorm]] called the [[Second Great Fire of London]].\n\nThere was a major rebuilding programme in the decades following the war, in some parts (such as at the Barbican) dramatically altering the urban landscape. But the destruction of the older historic fabric allowed the construction of modern and larger-scale developments, whereas in those parts not so badly affected by bomb damage the City retains its older character of smaller buildings. The street pattern, which is still largely medieval, was altered slightly in places, although there is a more recent trend of reversing some of the post-war modernist changes made, such as at [[Paternoster Square]].\n\nThe City suffered terrorist attacks including the [[1993 Bishopsgate bombing]] ([[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]]) and the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] ([[Islamic terrorism|Islamist]]). In response to the 1993 bombing, a system of road barriers, checkpoints and surveillance cameras referred to as the \"[[ring of steel (London)|ring of steel]]\" has been maintained to control entry points to the City.\n\nThe 1970s saw the construction of tall office buildings including the 600-foot (183&nbsp;m), 47-storey [[Natwest Tower]], the first skyscraper in the UK. Office space development has intensified especially in the central, northern and eastern parts, with skyscrapers including [[30 St Mary Axe|30 St. Mary Axe]] (\"the Gherkin\"'), [[122 Leadenhall Street|Leadenhall Building]] (\"the Cheesegrater\"), [[20 Fenchurch Street]] (\"the Walkie-Talkie\"), the [[Broadgate Tower]] and the [[Heron Tower]], the tallest in the City. Another skyscraper, [[22 Bishopsgate]], is under construction.\n\nThe main residential section of the City today is the [[Barbican Estate]], constructed between 1965 and 1976. The [[Museum of London]] is based there, as are a number of other services provided by the Corporation.\n\n''For a history of the etymology behind the City's streets see: [[Street names of the City of London]]''\n\n== Governance ==\n[[File:Guildhall, Londres, Inglaterra, 2014-08-11, DD 139.JPG|thumb|[[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]] is the ceremonial and administrative centre of the City.]]\n[[File:London MMB \u00bb2K9 Mansion House.jpg|thumb|[[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]] is the official residence of the Lord Mayor.]]\n[[File:Lord Mayor of London - John Stuttard - Nov 2006.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Stuttard]], Lord Mayor of the City of London 2006\u20132007, during the Lord Mayor's Show of 2006.]]\n{{Contradicts other|Freedom of the City|here|Necessity of Freedom of the City to stand for election?|date=June 2018}}\n{{See also|City of London Corporation|History of local government in England#The City of London}}\nThe City has a unique political status, a legacy of its uninterrupted integrity as a corporate city since the [[Heptarchy|Anglo-Saxon period]] and its singular relationship with the [[British monarchy|Crown]].

Unlike other English local authorities, the Corporation has two council bodies: the (now largely ceremonial) [[Court of Aldermen]] and the [[Court of Common Council]]. The [[Court of Aldermen]] represents the wards, with each ward (irrespective of size) returning one Alderman. The chief executive of the Corporation holds the ancient office of [[Town Clerk of London]].\n\nThe City is a [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] which has a Commission of Lieutenancy headed by the Lord Mayor instead of a [[Lord-Lieutenant]] and has [[Sheriffs of the City of London|two Sheriffs]] instead of a [[High Sheriff]] (see [[list of Sheriffs of London]]), quasi-judicial offices appointed by the [[Livery Company|Livery Companies]], an ancient political system based on the representation and [[Guild|protection of trades (Guilds)]].

The procedure of review is unique in the United Kingdom as it is not conducted by the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] or a local government boundary commission every 8 to 12 years, which is the case for all other [[Wards and electoral divisions of the United Kingdom|wards in Great Britain]]. Particular churches, [[livery company]] halls and other historic buildings and structures are associated with a ward, such as St Paul's Cathedral with [[Castle Baynard]], and London Bridge with Bridge; boundary changes in 2003 removed some of these historic connections.\n\nEach ward elects an [[Alderman]] to the [[Court of Aldermen]], and [[Commoners]] (the City equivalent of a [[Councillor]]) to the [[Court of Common Council]] of the Corporation. Only electors who are [[Freeman of the City of London|Freemen of the City of London]] are eligible to stand. The number of Commoners a ward sends to the Common Council varies from two to ten, depending on the number of electors in each ward. Since the 2003 review it has been agreed that the four more residential wards: [[Portsoken]], [[Queenhithe]], [[Aldersgate]] and [[Cripplegate]] together elect 20 of the 100 Commoners, whereas the business-dominated remainder elect the remaining 80 Commoners. 2003 and 2013 boundary changes have increased the residential emphasis of the mentioned four wards.\n\nCensus data provides eight nominal rather than 25 real wards, all of varying size and population.

Most of its voters are representatives of businesses and other bodies that occupy premises in the City. Its ancient wards have very unequal numbers of voters. In elections, both the businesses based in the City and the residents of the City vote.\n\nThe City of London Corporation was not reformed by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], because it had a more extensive electoral franchise than any other borough or city; in fact, it widened this further with its own equivalent legislation allowing one to become a [[Freedom of the City|freeman]] without being a [[liveryman]]. In 1801, the City had a population of about 130,000, but increasing development of the City as a central business district led to this falling to below 5,000 after the Second World War.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} It has risen slightly to around 9,000 since, largely due to the development of the [[Barbican Estate]].

However the boundaries of the City of London no longer coincide with the old city wall, as the City expanded its jurisdiction slightly over time. During the [[medieval]] era, the City's jurisdiction expanded westwards, crossing the historic western border of the original settlement\u2014the [[River Fleet]]\u2014along [[Fleet Street]] to [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]]. The City also took in the other \"City bars\" which were situated just beyond the old walled area, such as at Holborn, Aldersgate, Bishopsgate and Aldgate. These were the important entrances to the City and their control was vital in maintaining the City's special privileges over certain trades.\n[[File:Temple-bar-griffin.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Dragon statue on the [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]] monument, which marks the boundary between the City of London and [[City of Westminster]].]]\n\nMost of the wall has disappeared, but several sections remain visible. A section near the [[Museum of London]] was revealed after the devastation of an air raid on 29 December 1940 at the height of the [[The Blitz|Blitz]]. Other visible sections are at [[St Alphage London Wall|St Alphage]], and there are two sections near the [[Tower of London]]. The River Fleet was [[canal]]ised after the Great Fire of 1666 and then in stages was bricked up and has been since the 18th century one of London's \"[[Subterranean rivers of London|lost rivers or streams]]\", today underground as a [[storm drain]].\n\nThe boundary of the City was unchanged until minor boundary changes on 1 April 1994, when it expanded slightly to the west, north and east, taking small parcels of land from the London Boroughs of [[City of Westminster|Westminster]], [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]], [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]], [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]] and [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]]. The main purpose of these changes was to tidy up the boundary where it had been rendered obsolete by changes in the urban landscape. In this process the City also lost small parcels of land, though there was an overall net gain (the City grew from 1.05 to 1.12 square miles). Most notably, the changes placed the (then recently developed) [[Broadgate]] estate entirely in the City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si1993/Uksi_19931445_en_1.htm |title=The City and London Borough Boundaries Order 1993 |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |date=4 July 2011 |accessdate=30 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620210431/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si1993/Uksi_19931445_en_1.htm |archivedate=20 June 2010  }}</ref>\n\n[[Southwark]], to the south of the City on the other side of the [[River Thames|Thames]], was within the City between 1550 and 1899 as the ''Ward of [[Bridge Without]]'', a situation connected with the [[Guildable Manor]].

It turns east along [[Holborn]] to Holborn Circus, and then goes north east to [[Charterhouse Street]]. As it crosses [[Farringdon Road]] it becomes the boundary with Islington. It continues to [[Aldersgate]], goes north, and turns east into some back streets soon after Aldersgate becomes [[Goswell Road]], since 1994 embracing all of the Corporation's Golden Lane Estate. Here, at Baltic Street West, is the most northerly extent. The boundary includes all of the [[Barbican Estate]] and continues east along Ropemaker Street and its continuation on the other side of [[Moorgate]], becomes South Place. It goes north, reaching the border with Hackney, then east, north, east on back streets, with Worship Street forming a northern boundary, so as to include the [[Broadgate]] estate. The boundary then turns south at [[Norton Folgate]] and becomes the border with [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]]. It continues south into [[Bishopsgate]], and takes some backstreets to Middlesex Street ([[Petticoat Lane]]) where it continues south-east then south. It then turns south-west, crossing the [[Minories]] so as to exclude the [[Tower of London]], and then reaches the river. It then runs up the centre of the Thames, with the exception that [[Blackfriars Bridge]] falls within the City; the City controls [[London Bridge]] (as part of [[Bridge (ward)|Bridge]] ward) but only half of the river underneath it, a feature which is unique in British local administration.\n\nThe boundaries are marked by black bollards bearing the City's emblem, and by [[dragon boundary mark]]s at major entrances, such as Holborn.

Of the $3.98&nbsp;trillion daily global turnover, as measured in 2009, trading in London accounted for around $1.85&nbsp;trillion, or 46.7% of the total.<ref name=citylondon /> The [[pound sterling]], the currency of the United Kingdom, is globally the fourth most traded currency and the third most held [[reserve currency]].\n\nSince 1991 [[Canary Wharf]], a few miles east of the City in Tower Hamlets, has become another centre for London's financial services industry which houses many banks and other institutions formerly located in the Square Mile. Although growth has continued in both locations, and there have been relocations in both directions, the Corporation has come to realise that its planning policies may have been causing financial firms to choose Canary Wharf as a location.\n\n=== Headquarters ===\n[[File:Paternoster Square.jpg|thumb|[[Paternoster Square]], since 2004 the home of the [[London Stock Exchange]]]]\nMany major global companies have their headquarters in the City, including [[Aviva]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aviva.com/about-us/contact-us/|title=Contact us|accessdate=15 August 2010|publisher=Aviva|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007062338/http://www.aviva.com/about-us/contact-us/|archive-date=7 October 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[BT Group]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.btplc.com/thegroup/contactbt/index.cfm|title=Contact BT|accessdate=15 August 2010|publisher=BT Group|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6DosNnqp9?url=http://www.btplc.com/thegroup/contactbt/index.cfm|archive-date=20 January 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Lloyds Banking Group]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/about_us/company_contacts.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310191913/http://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/about_us/company_contacts.asp|url-status=dead|archive-date=10 March 2009|title=Company Contacts|accessdate=15 August 2010|publisher=Lloyds Banking Group}}</ref> [[Old Mutual]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldmutual.com/ir/contacts.jsp|title=Investor Relations Contacts|accessdate=15 August 2010|publisher=Old Mutual|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829165111/http://www.oldmutual.com/ir/contacts.jsp|archive-date=29 August 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Prudential plc|Prudential]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prudential.co.uk/prudential-plc/siteservices/directory/plccontact/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060106183040/http://www.prudential.co.uk/prudential-plc/siteservices/directory/plccontact/|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 January 2006|title=Contact|accessdate=15 August 2010|publisher=Prudential}}</ref> [[Schroders plc|Schroders]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schroders.com/en/contact-us/worldwide-locations/uk/|title=Contact us|accessdate=3 November 2016|publisher=Schroders|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104014437/http://www.schroders.com/en/contact-us/worldwide-locations/uk/|archive-date=4 November 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Standard Chartered Bank|Standard Chartered]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.standardchartered.com/uk/contact-us/en/|title=Contact Us|accessdate=15 August 2010|publisher=Standard Chartered|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829014438/http://www.standardchartered.com/uk/contact-us/en/|archive-date=29 August 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> and [[Unilever PLC|Unilever]].<ref>[http://www.unilever.com/resource/unilever-registered-offices.aspx Unilever registered offices] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830072007/http://www.unilever.com/resource/unilever-registered-offices.aspx |date=30 August 2010 }}</ref>\n\nA number of the world's largest law firms are headquartered in the City, including four of the \"[[Magic Circle (law firms)|Magic Circle]]\" law firms ([[Allen & Overy]], [[Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer]], [[Linklaters]] and [[Slaughter & May]]), as well as other firms such as [[DLA Piper]], [[Eversheds Sutherland]], [[Herbert Smith Freehills]] and [[Hogan Lovells]].\n\n=== Other sectors ===\n[[File:Barbican Centre City of London.jpg|thumb|right|Barbican Centre]]\nWhilst the financial sector, and related businesses and institutions, continue to dominate, the economy is not limited to that sector. The legal profession has a strong presence, especially in the west and north (i.e., towards the [[Inns of Court]]). Retail businesses were once important, but have gradually moved to the [[West End of London]], though it is now Corporation policy to encourage retailing in some locations, for example at [[Cheapside]] near St Paul's. The City has a number of visitor attractions, mainly based on its historic heritage as well as the [[Barbican Centre]] and adjacent [[Museum of London]], though tourism is not at present a major contributor to the City's economy or character. The City has many pubs, bars and restaurants, and the \"night-time\" economy does feature in the [[Bishopsgate]] area, towards [[Shoreditch]]. The meat market [[Smithfield Market|at Smithfield]], wholly within the City, continues to be one of London's main markets (the only one remaining in central London) and the country's largest [[butcher|meat market]]. In the east is [[Leadenhall Market]], a fresh food market that is also a visitor attraction.\n\n=== Retail and residential ===\nThe trend for purely office development is beginning to reverse as the Corporation encourages residential use, albeit with development occurring when it arises on windfall sites. The City has a target of 90 additional dwellings per year.<ref>[http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/LGNL_Services/Environment_and_planning/Planning/Local_Development_Framework/core_strategy.htm City of London Corporation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100512135507/http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/LGNL_Services/Environment_and_planning/Planning/Local_Development_Framework/core_strategy.htm |date=12 May 2010 }} Core Strategy</ref> Some of the extra accommodation is in small pre-[[World War II]] [[listed building]]s, which are not suitable for occupation by the large companies which now provide much of the City's employment. Recent residential developments include \"the Heron\", a high-rise residential building on the Milton Court site adjacent to the Barbican, and the [[Heron Tower#Heron Plaza|Heron Plaza]] development on Bishopsgate is also expected to include residential parts.\n\nSince the 1990s, the City has diversified away from near exclusive office use in other ways. For example, several hotels and the first [[department store]] opened in the 2000s. A shopping centre was more recently opened at [[One New Change]], [[Cheapside]] (near St Paul's Cathedral) in October 2010, which is open seven days a week. However, large sections remain quiet at weekends, especially in the eastern section, and it is quite common to find shops, [[Public house|pubs]] and cafes closed on these days.\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\n=== Historical buildings ===\nFire bombing and post-[[World War II]] redevelopment have meant that the City, despite its history, has fewer intact historic structures than one might expect. Nonetheless, there remain many dozens of (mostly Victorian and Edwardian) fine buildings, typically in historicist and [http://claxity.com/ neoclassical style]. They include the [[Monument to the Great Fire of London]] (\"the Monument\"), [[St Paul's Cathedral]], [[Guildhall, London|the Guildhall]], the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]], [[Dr. Johnson's House]], [[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]] and a [[:Category:Churches in the City of London|great many churches]], many designed by [[Sir Christopher Wren]], who also designed St Paul's. [[2 King's Bench Walk]] and [[Prince Henry's Room]] are notable historic survivors of heavy bombing of [[Temple, London|the Temple]] area, which has largely been rebuilt to its historic form. Another example of a bomb-damaged place having been restored is [[Staple Inn]] on Holborn. A few small sections of the Roman [[London Wall]] exist, for example near the Tower of London and in the Barbican area. Among the twentieth-century [[listed buildings]] are [[Bracken House, London|Bracken House]], the first post World War II buildings in the country to be given statutory protection, and the whole of the [[Barbican Estate|Barbican]] and [[Golden Lane Estate]].\n\nThe [[Tower of London]] is not in the City, but is a notable visitor attraction which brings tourists to the southeast of the City. Other landmark buildings with historical significance include the [[Bank of England]], the [[Old Bailey]], the [[Custom House, City of London|Custom House]], [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield Market]], [[Leadenhall Market]] and [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]]. Noteworthy contemporary buildings include a number of modern high-rise buildings (see section below) as well as the [[Lloyd's building]].\n\n[[File:Royal Exchange Panorama.jpg|centre|thumb|upright=2.25|The Bank of England (left) and the Royal Exchange (centre) are two of the many significant buildings in the City of London.]]\n\n=== Skyscrapers and tall buildings ===\n{{See also|List of tallest buildings and structures in London}}\n\n[[File:2016-02 City of London.jpg|thumb|The City skyline in February 2016, including [[20 Fenchurch Street]] (left), the [[122 Leadenhall Street|Leadenhall Building]] (centre) and [[30 St Mary Axe]] (right)]]\n\n;Completed\n\nA growing number of tall buildings and skyscrapers are principally used by the financial sector.

The boundaries of the Roman city were similar to those of the City of London today, though the City extends further west than Londonium's [[Ludgate]], and the Thames was undredged and thus wider than it is today, with Londonium's shoreline slightly north of the City's present shoreline. The Romans built a bridge across the river, as early as AD 50, near to today's [[London Bridge]].\n\n=== Decline ===\nBy the time the London Wall was constructed, the City's fortunes were in decline, and it faced problems of plague and fire. The Roman Empire entered a long period of [[Decline of the Roman Empire|instability and decline]], including the [[Carausian Revolt]] in Britain. In the 3rd and 4th centuries, the city was under attack from [[Picts]], Scots, and [[Saxons|Saxon]] raiders. The decline continued, both for Londinium and the Empire, and in AD 410 the Romans withdrew entirely from Britain. Many of the Roman public buildings in Londinium by this time had fallen into decay and disuse, and gradually after the formal withdrawal the city became almost (if not, at times, entirely) uninhabited. The centre of trade and population moved away from the walled Londinium to [[Lundenwic]] (\"London market\"), a settlement to the west, roughly in the modern day [[Strand, London|Strand]]/[[Aldwych]]/[[Covent Garden]] area.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n=== Anglo-Saxon restoration ===\n\n{{Main|Anglo-Saxon London}}\nDuring the Anglo-Saxon [[Heptarchy]], the London area came in turn under the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Essex|Essex]], [[Mercia]], and later [[Wessex]], though from the mid 8th century it was frequently under the control or threat of the [[Vikings]].\n[[File:Southwark Bridge City Plaque.JPG|left|thumb|Plaque near [[Southwark Bridge]] noting the activities around the time of [[Alfred the Great|King Alfred]].]]\n\n[[Bede]] records that in AD 604 [[Augustine of Canterbury|St Augustine]] consecrated [[Mellitus]] as the first bishop to the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] kingdom of the [[East Saxons]] and their king, [[S\u00e6berht of Essex|S\u00e6berht]].

The refortified Anglo-Saxon settlement was known as [[Lundenburh]] (\"London Fort\", a [[borough]]).

While London, and indeed England, were afterwards subjected to further periods of Viking and Danish raids and occupation, the establishment of the City of London and the [[Kingdom of England]] prevailed.<ref>''London: The Biography'', 2000, [[Peter Ackroyd]], p.&nbsp;33\u201335</ref>\n\nIn the 10th century, [[Athelstan]] permitted eight [[royal mint|mints]] to be established, compared with six in his capital, [[Winchester, Hampshire|Winchester]], indicating the wealth of the city. [[London Bridge]], which had fallen into ruin following the Roman evacuation and abandonment of Londinium, was rebuilt by the Saxons, but was periodically destroyed by Viking raids and storms.\n\nAs the focus of trade and population was moved back to within the old Roman walls, the older Saxon settlement of Lundenwic was largely abandoned and gained the name of ''Ealdwic'' (the \"old settlement\"). The name survives today as [[Aldwych]] (the \"old market-place\"), a name of a street and an area of the [[City of Westminster]] between [[Westminster]] and the City of London.\n\n=== Medieval era ===\n[[File:Map of London, 1300.svg|thumb|right|Map of London in about 1300]]\n[[File:DeathWatTyler.jpg|thumb|right|A pivotal event during the [[Peasants' Revolt]], 1381: their leader [[Wat Tyler]] is stabbed by [[William Walworth]], Lord Mayor]]\n{{See also|Norman and Medieval London}}\nFollowing the [[Battle of Hastings]], [[William the Conqueror]] marched on London ''(reaching as far as [[Southwark]])'', but failed to get across London Bridge or to defeat the Londoners.

Rather than continuing the war, [[Edgar the \u00c6theling]], [[Edwin, Earl of Mercia|Edwin of Mercia]] and [[Morcar]] of Northumbria surrendered at [[Berkhamsted]]. William granted the citizens of London a charter in 1075; the City was one of a few examples of the English retaining some authority. The City was not covered by the [[Domesday Book]].\n\nWilliam built three castles nearby, to keep Londoners subdued:\n\n* [[Tower of London]]\n* [[Baynard's Castle]]\n* [[Montfichet's Tower]]\n\nAbout 1130, [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] granted a [[Shrievalty of London|sheriff]] to the people of London, along with control of the county of [[Middlesex]]: this meant that the two entities were regarded as one administratively (not that the county was a dependency of the City) until the [[Local Government Act 1888]].<ref name=vch_middlesex>[[Victoria County History]]: A history of the County of Middlesex: Vol 2 pp&nbsp;15\u201360 paragraph 12, [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22153] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531055113/http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22153 |date=31 May 2012 }}. Retrieved 2 April 2012</ref> By 1141 the whole body of the citizenry was considered to constitute a single community. This 'commune' was the origin of the [[City of London Corporation]] and the citizens gained the right to appoint, with the king's consent, a mayor in 1189\u2014and to directly elect the mayor from 1215.\n\nFrom medieval times, the City has been composed of [[Wards of the City of London|25 ancient wards]], each headed by an [[alderman]], who chairs [[Wardmote]]s, which still take place at least annually. A [[Folkmoot]], for the whole of the City held at the outdoor cross of [[St Paul's Cathedral]], was formerly also held. Many of the medieval offices and traditions continue to the present day, demonstrating the unique nature of the City and its [[Corporation of London|Corporation]].\n\nIn 1381, the [[Peasants' Revolt]] affected London. The rebels took the City and the Tower of London, but the rebellion ended after its leader, Wat Tyler, was killed during a confrontation that included Lord Mayor [[William Walworth]].\n\n[[File:Civitas Londinium or The Agas Map of London.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Woodcut map of London|\"Woodcut\" map of London]], dating from the 1560s]]\n[[File:Great fire of london map.png|thumb|right|Map showing the extent of the [[Great Fire of London]], which destroyed nearly 80% of the City]]\n[[File:Great Fire London.jpg|thumb|right|The 1666 Great Fire as depicted in a 17th-century painting: it depicts Old London Bridge, churches, houses, and the Tower of London as seen from a boat near Tower Wharf]]\n\nThe City was burnt severely on a number of occasions, the worst being in 1123 and (more famously) in the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666. Both of these fires were referred to as ''the'' Great Fire. After the fire of 1666, a number of plans were drawn up to remodel the City and its street pattern into a [[renaissance]]-style city with planned urban blocks, squares and boulevards. These plans were almost entirely not taken up, and the medieval street pattern re-emerged almost intact.\n\n=== Early modern period ===\nBy the late 16th century, London increasingly became a major centre for banking, international trade and commerce. The [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]] was founded in 1565 by Sir [[Thomas Gresham]] as a centre of commerce for London's merchants, and gained Royal patronage in 1571. Although no longer used for its original purpose, its location at the corner of [[Cornhill, London|Cornhill]] and [[Threadneedle Street]] continues to be the geographical centre of the City's core of banking and financial services, with the [[Bank of England]] moving to its present site in 1734, opposite the Royal Exchange on Threadneedle Street. Immediately to the south of Cornhill, [[Lombard Street, London|Lombard Street]] was the location from 1691 of [[Lloyd's Coffee House]], which became the world-leading insurance market. London's insurance sector continues to be based in the area, particularly in [[Lime Street (ward)|Lime Street]].\n\nIn 1708, [[Christopher Wren]]'s masterpiece, [[St Paul's Cathedral]], was completed on his birthday. The first service had been held on 2 December 1697, more than 10 years earlier. It replaced the original St Paul's, which had been completely destroyed in the Great Fire of London, and is considered to be one of the finest cathedrals in Britain and a fine example of [[Baroque architecture]].\n\n=== Growth of London ===\n\nThe 18th century was a period of rapid growth for [[London]], reflecting an increasing national population, the early stirrings of the [[Industrial Revolution]], and London's role at the centre of the evolving [[British Empire]]. The urban area expanded beyond the borders of the City of London, most notably during this period towards the [[West End of London|West End]] and [[Westminster]].\n\nExpansion continued and became more rapid by the beginning of the 19th century, with London growing in all directions. To the [[East End of London|East]] the [[Port of London]] grew rapidly during the century, with the construction of many docks, needed as the Thames at the City could not cope with the volume of trade. The arrival of the railways and the [[London Underground|Tube]] meant that London could expand over a much greater area. By the mid-19th century, with London still rapidly expanding in population and area, the City had already become only a small part of the wider metropolis.\n\n=== 19th and 20th centuries ===\nAn attempt was made in 1894 with the [[Royal Commission on the Amalgamation of the City and County of London]] to end the distinction between the City and the surrounding County of London, but a change of government at Westminster meant the option was not taken up. The City as a distinct [[polity]] survived despite its position within the London conurbation and [[History of local government in London|numerous local government reforms]]. Supporting this status, the City was a special [[parliamentary borough]] that elected four members to the [[unreformed House of Commons]], who were retained after the [[Reform Act 1832]]; reduced to two under the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885]]; and ceased to be a separate constituency under the [[Representation of the People Act 1948]]. Since then the City is a minority (in terms of population and area) of the [[Cities of London and Westminster]].\n[[File:St Pauls Cathedral in 1896.JPG|thumb|left|[[St Paul's Cathedral]], 1896.]]\n\nThe City's population fell rapidly in the 19th century and through most of the 20th century, as people moved outwards in all directions to London's vast [[Metro-land|suburbs]], and many residential buildings were demolished to make way for office blocks. Like many areas of London and other British cities, the City fell victim to large scale and highly destructive aerial bombing during [[World War II]], especially in [[the Blitz]]. Whilst St Paul's Cathedral survived the onslaught, large swathes of the area did not and the particularly heavy raids of late December 1940 led to a [[firestorm]] called the [[Second Great Fire of London]].\n\nThere was a major rebuilding programme in the decades following the war, in some parts (such as at the Barbican) dramatically altering the urban landscape. But the destruction of the older historic fabric allowed the construction of modern and larger-scale developments, whereas in those parts not so badly affected by bomb damage the City retains its older character of smaller buildings. The street pattern, which is still largely medieval, was altered slightly in places, although there is a more recent trend of reversing some of the post-war modernist changes made, such as at [[Paternoster Square]].\n\nThe City suffered terrorist attacks including the [[1993 Bishopsgate bombing]] ([[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]]) and the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] ([[Islamic terrorism|Islamist]]). In response to the 1993 bombing, a system of road barriers, checkpoints and surveillance cameras referred to as the \"[[ring of steel (London)|ring of steel]]\" has been maintained to control entry points to the City.\n\nThe 1970s saw the construction of tall office buildings including the 600-foot (183&nbsp;m), 47-storey [[Natwest Tower]], the first skyscraper in the UK. Office space development has intensified especially in the central, northern and eastern parts, with skyscrapers including [[30 St Mary Axe|30 St. Mary Axe]] (\"the Gherkin\"'), [[122 Leadenhall Street|Leadenhall Building]] (\"the Cheesegrater\"), [[20 Fenchurch Street]] (\"the Walkie-Talkie\"), the [[Broadgate Tower]] and the [[Heron Tower]], the tallest in the City. Another skyscraper, [[22 Bishopsgate]], is under construction.\n\nThe main residential section of the City today is the [[Barbican Estate]], constructed between 1965 and 1976. The [[Museum of London]] is based there, as are a number of other services provided by the Corporation.\n\n''For a history of the etymology behind the City's streets see: [[Street names of the City of London]]''\n\n== Governance ==\n[[File:Guildhall, Londres, Inglaterra, 2014-08-11, DD 139.JPG|thumb|[[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]] is the ceremonial and administrative centre of the City.]]\n[[File:London MMB \u00bb2K9 Mansion House.jpg|thumb|[[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]] is the official residence of the Lord Mayor.]]\n[[File:Lord Mayor of London - John Stuttard - Nov 2006.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Stuttard]], Lord Mayor of the City of London 2006\u20132007, during the Lord Mayor's Show of 2006.]]\n{{Contradicts other|Freedom of the City|here|Necessity of Freedom of the City to stand for election?|date=June 2018}}\n{{See also|City of London Corporation|History of local government in England#The City of London}}\nThe City has a unique political status, a legacy of its uninterrupted integrity as a corporate city since the [[Heptarchy|Anglo-Saxon period]] and its singular relationship with the [[British monarchy|Crown]]. Historically its system of government was not unusual, but it was not reformed by the [[Municipal Reform Act 1835]] and little changed by later reforms.\n\nIt is administered by the [[City of London Corporation]], headed by the [[Lord Mayor of London]] (''not the same as the more recent [[Mayor of London]]''), which is responsible for a number of functions and has interests in land beyond the City's boundaries. Unlike other English local authorities, the Corporation has two council bodies: the (now largely ceremonial) [[Court of Aldermen]] and the [[Court of Common Council]]. The [[Court of Aldermen]] represents the wards, with each ward (irrespective of size) returning one Alderman. The chief executive of the Corporation holds the ancient office of [[Town Clerk of London]].\n\nThe City is a [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] which has a Commission of Lieutenancy headed by the Lord Mayor instead of a [[Lord-Lieutenant]] and has [[Sheriffs of the City of London|two Sheriffs]] instead of a [[High Sheriff]] (see [[list of Sheriffs of London]]), quasi-judicial offices appointed by the [[Livery Company|Livery Companies]], an ancient political system based on the representation and [[Guild|protection of trades (Guilds)]]. Senior members of the Livery Companies are known as [[Liveryman|Liverymen]] and form the Common Hall, which chooses the Lord Mayor, the Sheriffs and certain other officers.\n\n=== Wards ===\n{{Main|Wards of the City of London}}\nThe City is made up of [[:Category:Wards of the City of London|25 wards]].

The procedure of review is unique in the United Kingdom as it is not conducted by the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] or a local government boundary commission every 8 to 12 years, which is the case for all other [[Wards and electoral divisions of the United Kingdom|wards in Great Britain]]. Particular churches, [[livery company]] halls and other historic buildings and structures are associated with a ward, such as St Paul's Cathedral with [[Castle Baynard]], and London Bridge with Bridge; boundary changes in 2003 removed some of these historic connections.\n\nEach ward elects an [[Alderman]] to the [[Court of Aldermen]], and [[Commoners]] (the City equivalent of a [[Councillor]]) to the [[Court of Common Council]] of the Corporation. Only electors who are [[Freeman of the City of London|Freemen of the City of London]] are eligible to stand. The number of Commoners a ward sends to the Common Council varies from two to ten, depending on the number of electors in each ward. Since the 2003 review it has been agreed that the four more residential wards: [[Portsoken]], [[Queenhithe]], [[Aldersgate]] and [[Cripplegate]] together elect 20 of the 100 Commoners, whereas the business-dominated remainder elect the remaining 80 Commoners. 2003 and 2013 boundary changes have increased the residential emphasis of the mentioned four wards.\n\nCensus data provides eight nominal rather than 25 real wards, all of varying size and population. Being subject to renaming and definition at any time, these census 'wards' are notable in that four of the eight wards accounted for 67% of the 'square mile' and held 86% of the population, and these were in fact similar to and named after four City of London wards:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|+ Extract of census 'wards' where approximate to underlying legal wards<ref name=ons>{{cite web|url=http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk|title=Neighbourhood Statistics|first=Neil|last=Sillitoe|date=14 April 2008|access-date=19 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030211201309/http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/|archive-date=11 February 2003|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Census ward\n! rowspan=\"2\"|% of the City<br />of London\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Residents\n! colspan=\"2\"|% of built-upon land\n|-\n!Commercial\n!Residential\n|-\n|Cripplegate (east half of [[Barbican Estate|Barbican]] neighbourhood)||10.0%\t||2,782\t\t||79%\t||21%\n|-\n|Aldersgate (west half of Barbican neighbourhood)||4.5%\t||1,465\t\t||81%\t||19%\n|-\n|Farringdon Without (and much of Castle Baynard)||22.1%||1,099\t\t||90%\t||10%\n|-\n|Portsoken (contains [[Aldgate tube station|Aldgate Underground station]])||6.6%||985||86%||14%\n|}\n\n=== Elections ===\nThe City has a unique electoral system.

In elections, both the businesses based in the City and the residents of the City vote.\n\nThe City of London Corporation was not reformed by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], because it had a more extensive electoral franchise than any other borough or city; in fact, it widened this further with its own equivalent legislation allowing one to become a [[Freedom of the City|freeman]] without being a [[liveryman]]. In 1801, the City had a population of about 130,000, but increasing development of the City as a central business district led to this falling to below 5,000 after the Second World War.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} It has risen slightly to around 9,000 since, largely due to the development of the [[Barbican Estate]].

Under the new system, the number of non-resident voters has doubled from 16,000 to 32,000.

Bodies employing fewer than ten people may appoint one voter; those employing ten to 50 people one voter for every five employees; those employing more than 50 people ten voters and one additional voter for each 50 employees beyond the first 50.

However the boundaries of the City of London no longer coincide with the old city wall, as the City expanded its jurisdiction slightly over time. During the [[medieval]] era, the City's jurisdiction expanded westwards, crossing the historic western border of the original settlement\u2014the [[River Fleet]]\u2014along [[Fleet Street]] to [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]]. The City also took in the other \"City bars\" which were situated just beyond the old walled area, such as at Holborn, Aldersgate, Bishopsgate and Aldgate. These were the important entrances to the City and their control was vital in maintaining the City's special privileges over certain trades.\n[[File:Temple-bar-griffin.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Dragon statue on the [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]] monument, which marks the boundary between the City of London and [[City of Westminster]].]]\n\nMost of the wall has disappeared, but several sections remain visible. A section near the [[Museum of London]] was revealed after the devastation of an air raid on 29 December 1940 at the height of the [[The Blitz|Blitz]]. Other visible sections are at [[St Alphage London Wall|St Alphage]], and there are two sections near the [[Tower of London]]. The River Fleet was [[canal]]ised after the Great Fire of 1666 and then in stages was bricked up and has been since the 18th century one of London's \"[[Subterranean rivers of London|lost rivers or streams]]\", today underground as a [[storm drain]].\n\nThe boundary of the City was unchanged until minor boundary changes on 1 April 1994, when it expanded slightly to the west, north and east, taking small parcels of land from the London Boroughs of [[City of Westminster|Westminster]], [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]], [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]], [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]] and [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]]. The main purpose of these changes was to tidy up the boundary where it had been rendered obsolete by changes in the urban landscape. In this process the City also lost small parcels of land, though there was an overall net gain (the City grew from 1.05 to 1.12 square miles). Most notably, the changes placed the (then recently developed) [[Broadgate]] estate entirely in the City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si1993/Uksi_19931445_en_1.htm |title=The City and London Borough Boundaries Order 1993 |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |date=4 July 2011 |accessdate=30 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620210431/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si1993/Uksi_19931445_en_1.htm |archivedate=20 June 2010  }}</ref>\n\n[[Southwark]], to the south of the City on the other side of the [[River Thames|Thames]], was within the City between 1550 and 1899 as the ''Ward of [[Bridge Without]]'', a situation connected with the [[Guildable Manor]].

It turns east along [[Holborn]] to Holborn Circus, and then goes north east to [[Charterhouse Street]]. As it crosses [[Farringdon Road]] it becomes the boundary with Islington. It continues to [[Aldersgate]], goes north, and turns east into some back streets soon after Aldersgate becomes [[Goswell Road]], since 1994 embracing all of the Corporation's Golden Lane Estate. Here, at Baltic Street West, is the most northerly extent. The boundary includes all of the [[Barbican Estate]] and continues east along Ropemaker Street and its continuation on the other side of [[Moorgate]], becomes South Place. It goes north, reaching the border with Hackney, then east, north, east on back streets, with Worship Street forming a northern boundary, so as to include the [[Broadgate]] estate. The boundary then turns south at [[Norton Folgate]] and becomes the border with [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]]. It continues south into [[Bishopsgate]], and takes some backstreets to Middlesex Street ([[Petticoat Lane]]) where it continues south-east then south. It then turns south-west, crossing the [[Minories]] so as to exclude the [[Tower of London]], and then reaches the river. It then runs up the centre of the Thames, with the exception that [[Blackfriars Bridge]] falls within the City; the City controls [[London Bridge]] (as part of [[Bridge (ward)|Bridge]] ward) but only half of the river underneath it, a feature which is unique in British local administration.\n\nThe boundaries are marked by black bollards bearing the City's emblem, and by [[dragon boundary mark]]s at major entrances, such as Holborn. A more substantial monument marks the boundary at [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]] on Fleet Street.\n\nIn some places the financial district extends slightly beyond the boundaries, notably to the north and east, into the London Boroughs of Tower Hamlets, Hackney and Islington, and informally these locations are seen as part of the \"Square Mile\". Since the 1990s the eastern fringe, extending into Hackney and Tower Hamlets, has increasingly been a focus for large office developments due to the availability of large sites compared to within the City.\n\n=== Gardens and public art ===\n{{See also|List of public art in the City of London}}\n[[File:Finsbury Circus.jpg|thumb|right|[[Finsbury Circus]], the largest public open space, seen from [[Tower 42]]]]\nThe City has no sizeable parks within its boundary, but does have a network of a large number of gardens and small open spaces, many of them maintained by the Corporation.

In the east is [[Leadenhall Market]], a fresh food market that is also a visitor attraction.\n\n=== Retail and residential ===\nThe trend for purely office development is beginning to reverse as the Corporation encourages residential use, albeit with development occurring when it arises on windfall sites. The City has a target of 90 additional dwellings per year.<ref>[http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/LGNL_Services/Environment_and_planning/Planning/Local_Development_Framework/core_strategy.htm City of London Corporation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100512135507/http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/LGNL_Services/Environment_and_planning/Planning/Local_Development_Framework/core_strategy.htm |date=12 May 2010 }} Core Strategy</ref> Some of the extra accommodation is in small pre-[[World War II]] [[listed building]]s, which are not suitable for occupation by the large companies which now provide much of the City's employment. Recent residential developments include \"the Heron\", a high-rise residential building on the Milton Court site adjacent to the Barbican, and the [[Heron Tower#Heron Plaza|Heron Plaza]] development on Bishopsgate is also expected to include residential parts.\n\nSince the 1990s, the City has diversified away from near exclusive office use in other ways. For example, several hotels and the first [[department store]] opened in the 2000s. A shopping centre was more recently opened at [[One New Change]], [[Cheapside]] (near St Paul's Cathedral) in October 2010, which is open seven days a week. However, large sections remain quiet at weekends, especially in the eastern section, and it is quite common to find shops, [[Public house|pubs]] and cafes closed on these days.\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\n=== Historical buildings ===\nFire bombing and post-[[World War II]] redevelopment have meant that the City, despite its history, has fewer intact historic structures than one might expect. Nonetheless, there remain many dozens of (mostly Victorian and Edwardian) fine buildings, typically in historicist and [http://claxity.com/ neoclassical style]. They include the [[Monument to the Great Fire of London]] (\"the Monument\"), [[St Paul's Cathedral]], [[Guildhall, London|the Guildhall]], the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]], [[Dr. Johnson's House]], [[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]] and a [[:Category:Churches in the City of London|great many churches]], many designed by [[Sir Christopher Wren]], who also designed St Paul's. [[2 King's Bench Walk]] and [[Prince Henry's Room]] are notable historic survivors of heavy bombing of [[Temple, London|the Temple]] area, which has largely been rebuilt to its historic form. Another example of a bomb-damaged place having been restored is [[Staple Inn]] on Holborn. A few small sections of the Roman [[London Wall]] exist, for example near the Tower of London and in the Barbican area. Among the twentieth-century [[listed buildings]] are [[Bracken House, London|Bracken House]], the first post World War II buildings in the country to be given statutory protection, and the whole of the [[Barbican Estate|Barbican]] and [[Golden Lane Estate]].\n\nThe [[Tower of London]] is not in the City, but is a notable visitor attraction which brings tourists to the southeast of the City. Other landmark buildings with historical significance include the [[Bank of England]], the [[Old Bailey]], the [[Custom House, City of London|Custom House]], [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield Market]], [[Leadenhall Market]] and [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]]. Noteworthy contemporary buildings include a number of modern high-rise buildings (see section below) as well as the [[Lloyd's building]].\n\n[[File:Royal Exchange Panorama.jpg|centre|thumb|upright=2.25|The Bank of England (left) and the Royal Exchange (centre) are two of the many significant buildings in the City of London.]]\n\n=== Skyscrapers and tall buildings ===\n{{See also|List of tallest buildings and structures in London}}\n\n[[File:2016-02 City of London.jpg|thumb|The City skyline in February 2016, including [[20 Fenchurch Street]] (left), the [[122 Leadenhall Street|Leadenhall Building]] (centre) and [[30 St Mary Axe]] (right)]]\n\n;Completed\n\nA growing number of tall buildings and skyscrapers are principally used by the financial sector.

Other species are used in [[cheesemaking]]. According to the ''Dictionary of the Fungi'' (10th edition, 2008), the widespread genus contains over 300 species.<ref name=Kirk2008/>\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe genus was first described in the scientific literature by [[Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link]] in his 1809 work ''Observationes in ordines plantarum naturales'', writing \"Penicillium.

The common apple rot fungus ''P.&nbsp;expansum'' was selected as the [[type species]].<ref name=Samson1985/>\n\nIn a 1979 [[monograph]], John I. Pitt divided ''Penicillium'' into four [[subgenera]] based on conidiophore [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] and branching pattern: ''Aspergilloides'', ''Biverticillium'', ''Furcatum'', and ''Penicillium''.<ref name=Pitt1979/>\n\n=== Species ===\n{{main|List of Penicillium species}}\n[[File:Ascomycetes.jpg|thumb|right|Various fungi including ''Penicillium'' and ''Aspergillus'' species growing in [[axenic culture]]]]\n[[File:Penicilliummandarijntjes.jpg|thumb|right|Some penicillium mold on [[mandarin orange]]s ]]\n\nSelected species include;\n* ''[[Penicillium albocoremium]]''\n* ''[[Penicillium aurantiogriseum]]''\n* ''[[Penicillium bilaiae]]'', which is an agricultural inoculant\n* ''[[Penicillium camemberti]]'', which is used in the production of [[Camembert (cheese)|Camembert]] and [[Brie cheese|Brie]] [[cheese]]s\n* ''[[Penicillium candidum]]'', which is used in making Brie and Camembert.

[[Conidiophores]] are at the end of each branch accompanied by green spherical constricted units called [[conidiospores]]. These individual units play a significant role in reproduction; conidiospores are the main dispersal route of the fungi. \n\nSexual reproduction involves the production of [[ascospore]]s, commencing with the fusion of an [[archegonium]] and an [[antheridium]], with sharing of nuclei. The irregularly distributed [[ascus|asci]] contain eight unicellular ascospores each.\n\n== Ecology ==\nSpecies of ''Penicillium'' are ubiquitous soil fungi preferring cool and moderate climates, commonly present wherever organic material is available. [[Saprophytic]] species of ''Penicillium'' and ''[[Aspergillus]]'' are among the best-known representatives of the [[Eurotiales]] and live mainly on organic biodegradable substances. Commonly known in America as [[Mold (fungus)|mold]]s, they are among the main causes of [[food spoilage]], especially species of [[subgenus]] ''Penicillium''.<ref name=Samson2004/> Many species produce highly toxic [[mycotoxin]]s. The ability of these ''Penicillium'' species to grow on seeds and other stored foods depends on their propensity to thrive in low humidity and to colonize rapidly by aerial dispersion while the seeds are sufficiently moist.<ref name=Pitt2000/> Some species have a blue color, commonly growing on old bread and giving it a blue fuzzy texture.\n\nSome ''Penicillium'' species affect the fruits and bulbs of plants, including ''[[Penicillium expansum|P.&nbsp;expansum]]'', apples and pears; ''[[Penicillium digitatum|P.&nbsp;digitatum]]'', citrus fruits;<ref name=Baigre2003/> and ''[[Penicillium allii|P.&nbsp;allii]]'', garlic.<ref name=Valdez2006/> Some species are known to be pathogenic to animals; ''[[Penicillium corylophilum|P.&nbsp;corylophilum]]'', ''[[Penicillium fellutanum|P.&nbsp;fellutanum]]'', ''[[Penicillium implicatum|P.&nbsp;implicatum]]'', ''[[Penicillium janthinellum|P.&nbsp;janthinellum]]'', ''[[Penicillium viridicatum|P.&nbsp;viridicatum]]'', and ''[[Penicillium waksmanii|P.&nbsp;waksmanii]]'' are potential pathogens of [[mosquitoes]].<ref name=daCosta1998/> \n\n''Penicillium'' species are present in the air and dust of indoor environments, such as homes and public buildings. The fungus can be readily transported from the outdoors, and grow indoors using building material or accumulated soil to obtain nutrients for growth. ''Penicillium'' growth can still occur indoors even if the relative humidity is low, as long as there is sufficient moisture available on a given surface. A British study determined that ''Aspergillus''- and ''Penicillium''-type spores were the most prevalent in the indoor air of residential properties, and exceeded outdoor levels.<ref name=Fairs2010/> Even [[Tile#Ceiling tiles|ceiling tile]]s can support the growth of ''Penicillium''\u2014as one study demonstrated\u2014if the [[relative humidity]] is 85% and the moisture content of the tiles is greater than 2.2%.<ref name=Chang1995/>\n\nSome ''Penicillium'' species cause damage to machinery and the combustible materials and lubricants used to run and maintain them. For example, ''[[Penicillium chrysogenum|P.&nbsp;chrysogenum]] (formerly [[P. chrysogenum|P. notatum]])'', ''[[Penicillium steckii|P.&nbsp;steckii]]'', ''[[Penicillium notatum|&nbsp;]][[Penicillium cyclopium|P.&nbsp;cyclopium]]'', and ''[[Penicillium nalgiovensis|P.&nbsp;nalgiovensis]]'' affect fuels; ''P.&nbsp;chrysogenum'', ''[[Penicillium rubrum|P.&nbsp;rubrum]]'', and ''[[Penicillium verrucosum|P.&nbsp;verrucosum]]'' cause damage to oils and lubricants; ''[[Penicillium regulosum|P.&nbsp;regulosum]]'' damages optical and protective glass.<ref name=Semenov2003/>\n\n== Economic value ==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 200\n| image1    = Penicillin core.svg\n| caption1  = Core structure of penicillin\n| image2    = Griseofulvin.svg\n| caption2  = Griseofulvin\n}}\nSeveral species of the genus ''Penicillium'' play a central role in the production of cheese and of various meat products. To be specific, ''Penicillium'' molds are found in [[Blue cheese]]. ''[[Penicillium camemberti]]'' and ''[[Penicillium roqueforti]]'' are the molds on [[Camembert]], [[Brie]], [[Roquefort]], and many other cheeses. ''[[Penicillium nalgiovense]]'' is used in soft mold-ripened cheeses, such as Nal\u017eovy (ellischau) cheese, and to improve the taste of sausages and hams, and to prevent colonization by other molds and bacteria.<ref name=\"Mr\u00e1zek2015\"/><ref name=Marianski2009/>\n\nIn addition to their importance in the food industry, species of ''Penicillium'' and ''Aspergillus'' serve in the production of a number of biotechnologically produced [[enzyme]]s and other macromolecules, such as [[gluconic acid|gluconic]], [[citric acid|citric]], and [[tartaric acid]]s, as well as several [[pectinase]]s, [[lipase]], [[amylase]]s, [[cellulase]]s, and [[protease]]s.  Some ''Penicillium'' species have shown potential for use in [[bioremediation]], more specifically [[mycoremediation]], because of their ability to break down a variety of [[Environmental xenobiotic|xenobiotic compounds]].<ref name=Leitao2009/> Penicillium also prevents bacteria from affecting the body.{{fact|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe genus includes a wide variety of species molds that are the source molds of major [[antibiotic]]s. [[Penicillin]], a drug produced by ''[[Penicillium chrysogenum|P.&nbsp;chrysogenum]] (formerly P.&nbsp;notatum),'' was accidentally discovered by [[Alexander Fleming]] in 1929, and found to inhibit the growth of [[Gram-positive]] bacteria (see [[beta-lactams]]). Its potential as an antibiotic was realized in the late 1930s, and [[Howard Florey]] and [[Ernst Chain]] purified and concentrated the compound. The drug's success in saving soldiers in World War II who had been dying from infected wounds resulted in Fleming, Florey and Chain jointly winning the [[Nobel Prize in Medicine]] in 1945.<ref name=Rifkind2005/>\n\n[[Griseofulvin]] is an [[antifungal drug]] and a potential [[chemotherapeutic agent]]<ref name=Singh2008/> that was discovered in ''[[Penicillium griseofulvum|P.&nbsp;griseofulvum]]''.<ref name=DeCarli1988/> Additional species that produce compounds capable of inhibiting the growth of tumor cells ''[[in vitro]]'' include: ''[[Penicillium pinophilum|P.&nbsp;pinophilum]]'',<ref name=Nicoletti2009/> ''[[Penicillium canescens|P.&nbsp;canescens]]'',<ref name=Nicoletti2008/> and ''[[Penicillium glabrum|P.&nbsp;glabrum]]''.<ref name=Nicoletti2008/>\n\n==Reproduction==\nAlthough many [[eukaryote]]s are able to reproduce [[Sexual reproduction|sexually]], as much as 20% of [[fungus|fungal]] species had been thought to reproduce exclusively by [[Asexual reproduction|asexual]] means. However recent studies have revealed that [[sex]] occurs even in some of the supposedly asexual species.

Other species are used in [[cheesemaking]]. According to the ''Dictionary of the Fungi'' (10th edition, 2008), the widespread genus contains over 300 species.<ref name=Kirk2008/>\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe genus was first described in the scientific literature by [[Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link]] in his 1809 work ''Observationes in ordines plantarum naturales'', writing \"Penicillium. Thallus e floccis caespitosis septatis simplicibus aut ramosis fertilibus erectis apice penicillatis\", where penicillatis referred to \"pencil-like\" (referring to a [[Pencil#Camel.27s hair pencil|Camel's hair pencil brush]].<ref>Identification and nomenclature of the genus Penicillium, C.M.

The common apple rot fungus ''P.&nbsp;expansum'' was selected as the [[type species]].<ref name=Samson1985/>\n\nIn a 1979 [[monograph]], John I. Pitt divided ''Penicillium'' into four [[subgenera]] based on conidiophore [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] and branching pattern: ''Aspergilloides'', ''Biverticillium'', ''Furcatum'', and ''Penicillium''.<ref name=Pitt1979/>\n\n=== Species ===\n{{main|List of Penicillium species}}\n[[File:Ascomycetes.jpg|thumb|right|Various fungi including ''Penicillium'' and ''Aspergillus'' species growing in [[axenic culture]]]]\n[[File:Penicilliummandarijntjes.jpg|thumb|right|Some penicillium mold on [[mandarin orange]]s ]]\n\nSelected species include;\n* ''[[Penicillium albocoremium]]''\n* ''[[Penicillium aurantiogriseum]]''\n* ''[[Penicillium bilaiae]]'', which is an agricultural inoculant\n* ''[[Penicillium camemberti]]'', which is used in the production of [[Camembert (cheese)|Camembert]] and [[Brie cheese|Brie]] [[cheese]]s\n* ''[[Penicillium candidum]]'', which is used in making Brie and Camembert.

[[Conidiophores]] are at the end of each branch accompanied by green spherical constricted units called [[conidiospores]]. These individual units play a significant role in reproduction; conidiospores are the main dispersal route of the fungi. \n\nSexual reproduction involves the production of [[ascospore]]s, commencing with the fusion of an [[archegonium]] and an [[antheridium]], with sharing of nuclei. The irregularly distributed [[ascus|asci]] contain eight unicellular ascospores each.\n\n== Ecology ==\nSpecies of ''Penicillium'' are ubiquitous soil fungi preferring cool and moderate climates, commonly present wherever organic material is available. [[Saprophytic]] species of ''Penicillium'' and ''[[Aspergillus]]'' are among the best-known representatives of the [[Eurotiales]] and live mainly on organic biodegradable substances. Commonly known in America as [[mold]]s, they are among the main causes of [[food spoilage]], especially species of [[subgenus]] ''Penicillium''.<ref name=Samson2004/> Many species produce highly toxic [[mycotoxin]]s. The ability of these ''Penicillium'' species to grow on seeds and other stored foods depends on their propensity to thrive in low humidity and to colonize rapidly by aerial dispersion while the seeds are sufficiently moist.<ref name=Pitt2000/> Some species have a blue color, commonly growing on old bread and giving it a blue fuzzy texture.\n\nSome ''Penicillium'' species affect the fruits and bulbs of plants, including ''[[Penicillium expansum|P.&nbsp;expansum]]'', apples and pears; ''[[Penicillium digitatum|P.&nbsp;digitatum]]'', citrus fruits;<ref name=Baigre2003/> and ''[[Penicillium allii|P.&nbsp;allii]]'', garlic.<ref name=Valdez2006/> Some species are known to be pathogenic to animals; ''[[Penicillium corylophilum|P.&nbsp;corylophilum]]'', ''[[Penicillium fellutanum|P.&nbsp;fellutanum]]'', ''[[Penicillium implicatum|P.&nbsp;implicatum]]'', ''[[Penicillium janthinellum|P.&nbsp;janthinellum]]'', ''[[Penicillium viridicatum|P.&nbsp;viridicatum]]'', and ''[[Penicillium waksmanii|P.&nbsp;waksmanii]]'' are potential pathogens of [[mosquitoes]].<ref name=daCosta1998/> \n\n''Penicillium'' species are present in the air and dust of indoor environments, such as homes and public buildings. The fungus can be readily transported from the outdoors, and grow indoors using building material or accumulated soil to obtain nutrients for growth. ''Penicillium'' growth can still occur indoors even if the relative humidity is low, as long as there is sufficient moisture available on a given surface. A British study determined that ''Aspergillus''- and ''Penicillium''-type spores were the most prevalent in the indoor air of residential properties, and exceeded outdoor levels.<ref name=Fairs2010/> Even [[Tile#Ceiling tiles|ceiling tile]]s can support the growth of ''Penicillium''\u2014as one study demonstrated\u2014if the [[relative humidity]] is 85% and the moisture content of the tiles is greater than 2.2%.<ref name=Chang1995/>\n\nSome ''Penicillium'' species cause damage to machinery and the combustible materials and lubricants used to run and maintain them. For example, ''[[Penicillium chrysogenum|P.&nbsp;chrysogenum]] (formerly [[P. chrysogenum|P. notatum]])'', ''[[Penicillium steckii|P.&nbsp;steckii]]'', ''[[Penicillium notatum|&nbsp;]][[Penicillium cyclopium|P.&nbsp;cyclopium]]'', and ''[[Penicillium nalgiovensis|P.&nbsp;nalgiovensis]]'' affect fuels; ''P.&nbsp;chrysogenum'', ''[[Penicillium rubrum|P.&nbsp;rubrum]]'', and ''[[Penicillium verrucosum|P.&nbsp;verrucosum]]'' cause damage to oils and lubricants; ''[[Penicillium regulosum|P.&nbsp;regulosum]]'' damages optical and protective glass.<ref name=Semenov2003/>\n\n== Economic value ==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 200\n| image1    = Penicillin core.svg\n| caption1  = Core structure of penicillin\n| image2    = Griseofulvin.svg\n| caption2  = Griseofulvin\n}}\nSeveral species of the genus ''Penicillium'' play a central role in the production of cheese and of various meat products. To be specific, ''Penicillium'' molds are found in [[Blue cheese]]. ''[[Penicillium camemberti]]'' and ''[[Penicillium roqueforti]]'' are the molds on [[Camembert]], [[Brie]], [[Roquefort]], and many other cheeses. ''[[Penicillium nalgiovense]]'' is used in soft mold-ripened cheeses, such as Nal\u017eovy (ellischau) cheese, and to improve the taste of sausages and hams, and to prevent colonization by other molds and bacteria.<ref name=\"Mr\u00e1zek2015\"/><ref name=Marianski2009/>\n\nIn addition to their importance in the food industry, species of ''Penicillium'' and ''Aspergillus'' serve in the production of a number of biotechnologically produced [[enzyme]]s and other macromolecules, such as [[gluconic acid|gluconic]], [[citric acid|citric]], and [[tartaric acid]]s, as well as several [[pectinase]]s, [[lipase]], [[amylase]]s, [[cellulase]]s, and [[protease]]s.  Some ''Penicillium'' species have shown potential for use in [[bioremediation]], more specifically [[mycoremediation]], because of their ability to break down a variety of [[Environmental xenobiotic|xenobiotic compounds]].<ref name=Leitao2009/> Penicillium also prevents bacteria from affecting the body.{{fact|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe genus includes a wide variety of species molds that are the source molds of major [[antibiotic]]s. [[Penicillin]], a drug produced by ''[[Penicillium chrysogenum|P.&nbsp;chrysogenum]] (formerly P.&nbsp;notatum),'' was accidentally discovered by [[Alexander Fleming]] in 1929, and found to inhibit the growth of [[Gram-positive]] bacteria (see [[beta-lactams]]). Its potential as an antibiotic was realized in the late 1930s, and [[Howard Florey]] and [[Ernst Chain]] purified and concentrated the compound. The drug's success in saving soldiers in World War II who had been dying from infected wounds resulted in Fleming, Florey and Chain jointly winning the [[Nobel Prize in Medicine]] in 1945.<ref name=Rifkind2005/>\n\n[[Griseofulvin]] is an [[antifungal drug]] and a potential [[chemotherapeutic agent]]<ref name=Singh2008/> that was discovered in ''[[Penicillium griseofulvum|P.&nbsp;griseofulvum]]''.<ref name=DeCarli1988/> Additional species that produce compounds capable of inhibiting the growth of tumor cells ''[[in vitro]]'' include: ''[[Penicillium pinophilum|P.&nbsp;pinophilum]]'',<ref name=Nicoletti2009/> ''[[Penicillium canescens|P.&nbsp;canescens]]'',<ref name=Nicoletti2008/> and ''[[Penicillium glabrum|P.&nbsp;glabrum]]''.<ref name=Nicoletti2008/>\n\n==Reproduction==\nAlthough many [[eukaryote]]s are able to reproduce [[Sexual reproduction|sexually]], as much as 20% of [[fungus|fungal]] species had been thought to reproduce exclusively by [[Asexual reproduction|asexual]] means. However recent studies have revealed that [[sex]] occurs even in some of the supposedly asexual species.  For example, sexual capability was recently shown for the fungus ''[[Penicillium roqueforti]]'', used as a starter for [[blue cheese]] production.<ref name=\"pmid23185400\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ropars J, Dupont J, Fontanillas E, Rodr\u00edguez de la Vega RC, Malagnac F, Coton M, Giraud T, L\u00f3pez-Villavicencio M |title=Sex in cheese: evidence for sexuality in the fungus Penicillium roqueforti |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=7 |issue=11 |pages=e49665 |year=2012 |pmid=23185400 |pmc=3504111 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0049665 }}</ref>  This finding was based, in part, on evidence for functional [[mating type]] (MAT) genes that are involved in fungal sexual compatibility, and the presence in the sequenced genome of most of the important genes known to be involved in [[meiosis]].

{"title_page": "Stack machine", "text_new": "{{For|stack machines in automata theory|Pushdown automaton}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{Essay-like|date=August 2011}}\n{{Original research|section|date=February 2016}}}}\nIn [[computer science]], [[computer engineering]] and [[programming language implementation]]s, a '''stack machine''' is a type of computer. In some cases, the term refers to a software scheme that simulates a stack machine.\n\nThe main difference from other computers is that most of its instructions operate on a [[stack (data structure)|pushdown stack]] of numbers rather than numbers held in [[processor registers]]. Because the operands used in the instructions are always in a known location (at the top of the stack), the instructions themselves do not require [[memory address]]es or register numbers to supply their operands. This leads to an [[instruction set architecture]] (ISA) style known as a '''zero address format'''.<ref>{{cite magazine |first= Bob |last=Beard  |magazine= Computer RESURRECTION |date= Autumn 1997 |url=http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/CCS/res/res18.htm#c |title=The KDF9 Computer - 30 Years On}}</ref>\n\nStacks are not unique to stack machines; most [[programming language]]s make extensive use of stacks to support [[subroutine]]s and [[method call]]s. For this reason, stack machines more closely mimic the inner workings of the programs that run on them, assuming the programs are written in [[high level language]]s. This has led to a number of [[central processor unit]] designs that implement stack machines in order to provide higher performance. In practice, however, these designs have been outperformed by the traditional [[register machine]] systems, and have remained a niche player in the market.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Practical expression-stack machines==\nA \"stack machine\" is a computer that uses a last-in, first-out [[stack (data structure)|stack]] to hold short-lived temporary values. Most of its instructions assume that operands will be from the stack, and results placed in the stack.\n\nFor a typical instruction such as {{code|Add}} the computer takes both operands from the topmost (most recent) values of the stack. The computer replaces those two values with the sum, which the computer calculates when it performs the {{code|Add}} instruction.  The instruction's operands are \"popped\" off the stack, and its result(s) are then \"pushed\" back onto the stack, ready for the next instruction.   Most stack instructions have only an [[opcode]] commanding an operation, with no additional fields to identify a constant, register or memory cell.  The stack easily holds more than two inputs or more than one result, so a richer set of operations can be computed.  Integer constant operands are often pushed by separate {{code|Load Immediate}} instructions.  Memory is often accessed by separate {{code|Load}} or {{code|Store}} instructions containing a memory address or calculating the address from values in the stack.\n\nFor speed, a stack machine often implements some part of its stack with registers. To execute quickly, operands of the [[arithmetic logic unit]] (ALU) may be the top two registers of the stack and the result from the ALU is stored in the top register of the stack.  Some stack machines have a stack of limited size, implemented as a register file. The ALU will access this with an index. Some machines have a stack of unlimited size, implemented as an array in RAM accessed by a \"top of stack\" address register. This is slower, but the number of flip-flops is less, making a less-expensive, more compact CPU.  Its topmost N values may be [[Cache (computing)|cached]] for speed. A few machines have both an expression stack in memory and a separate register stack. In this case, software, or an interrupt may move data between them.\n\nThe [[instruction set]] carries out most ALU actions with postfix ([[reverse Polish notation]]) operations that work only on the expression stack, not on data registers or main memory cells. This can be very convenient for executing high-level languages, because most arithmetic expressions can be easily translated into postfix notation.\n\nIn contrast, [[register machine]]s hold temporary values in a small, fast array of [[Processor register|register]]s.  [[Accumulator machine]]s have only one general-purpose register.  [[Belt machine]]s use a FIFO queue to hold temporary values.  Memory-to-memory machines do not have any temporary registers usable by a programmer.\n\nStack machines may have their expression stack and their [[call stack|call-return stack]] separated or as one integrated structure. If they are separated, the instructions of the stack machine can be [[instruction pipelining|pipelined]] with fewer interactions and less design complexity. Usually it can run faster.\n\nSome technical handheld calculators use reverse Polish notation in their keyboard interface, instead of having parenthesis keys.  This is a form of stack machine.  The Plus key relies on its two operands already being at the correct topmost positions of the user-visible stack.\n\n===Advantages of stack machine instruction sets===\n====Very compact object code====\nIn stack machine code, the most frequent instructions consist of just an opcode selecting the operation.  This can easily fit in 6 bits or less.  Branches, load immediates, and load/store instructions require an argument field, but stack machines often arrange that the frequent cases of these still fit together with the opcode into a compact group of bits.  The selection of operands from prior results is done implicitly by ordering the instructions.  In contrast, register machines require two or three register-number fields per ALU instruction to select operands; the densest register machines average about 16 bits per instruction.\n\nThe instructions for accumulator or memory-to-memory machines are not padded out with multiple register fields.  Instead, they use compiler-managed anonymous variables for subexpression values.  These temporary locations require extra memory reference instructions which take more code space than for the stack machine, or even compact register machines.\n\nAll practical stack machines have variants of the load\u2013store opcodes for accessing [[local variable]]s and [[formal parameter]]s without explicit address calculations.  This can be by offsets from the current top-of-stack address, or by offsets from a stable frame-base register.  Register machines handle this with a register+offset address mode, but use a wider offset field.\n\n[[Instruction set#Code density|Dense machine code]] was very valuable in the 1960s, when main memory was very expensive and very limited even on mainframes. It became important again on the initially-tiny memories of minicomputers and then microprocessors. Density remains important today, for smartphone applications, applications downloaded into browsers over slow Internet connections, and in ROMs for embedded applications. A more general advantage of increased density is improved effectiveness of caches and instruction prefetch.\n\nSome of the density of [[Burroughs large systems#B6500|Burroughs B6700]] code was due to moving vital operand information elsewhere, to 'tags' on every data word or into tables of pointers.  The Add instruction itself was generic or polymorphic.  It had to fetch the operand to discover whether this was an integer add or floating point add.  The Load instruction could find itself tripping on an [[Addressing mode|indirect address]], or worse, a disguised call to a [[call-by-name]] [[thunk]] routine.  The generic opcodes required fewer opcode bits but made the hardware more like an interpreter, with less opportunity to pipeline the common cases.\n\n====Simple compilers====\nCompilers for stack machines are simpler and quicker to build than compilers for other machines.  Code generation is trivial and independent of prior or subsequent code. The picture shows the syntax tree corresponding to the example expression ''A''*(''B''-''C'')+(''D''+''E'').\n\n[[File:AST binary tree arith variables.svg|thumb|Binary syntax tree for the expression ''A''*(''B''-''C'') + (''D''+''E'')]]\n\nThe compiled code for a simple stack machine would take the form (corresponding to the expressions' reverse Polish notation ''A'' ''B'' ''C'' - * ''D'' ''E'' + +):\n\n                  # stack contents (leftmost = top):\n  push A          #           A\n  push B          #     B     A\n  push C          # C   B     A\n  subtract        #     B-C   A\n  multiply        #           A*(B-C)\n  push D          #     D     A*(B-C)\n  push E          # E   D     A*(B-C)\n  add             #     D+E   A*(B-C)\n  add             #           A*(B-C)+(D+E)\n\nThe arithmetic operations 'subtract', 'multiply', and 'add' act on the two topmost operands of the stack.\n\nSuch simple compilation can be done by the parsing pass.  No register management is needed. Most stack machines can copy stack entries to avoid memory access (which is much slower), but these are usually trivial.  The same opcode that handles the frequent common case of an add, an indexed load, or a function call will also handle the general case involving complex subexpressions and nested calls. The compiler and the CPU do not need special cases for instructions that have separate calculation paths for addresses.\n\nThis simplicity has allowed compilers to fit onto very small machines.  The simple compilers allowed new product lines to get to market quickly, and allowed new operating systems to be written entirely in a high level language rather than in assembly.  For example, the [[UCSD Pascal|UCSD p-System]] supported a complete student programming environment on early 8-bit microprocessors with poor instruction sets and little RAM, by compiling to a virtual stack machine rather than to the actual hardware.\n\nThe downside to the simplicity of compilers for stack machines, is that pure stack machines have fewer optimisations (see subsections in [[#Performance disadvantages of stack machines|\u00a7 performance disadvantages of stack machines]]). However optimisation of compiled stack code is quite possible. Back-end optimisation of compiler output has been demonstrated to significantly improve code,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Koopman|first=Philip|title=A Preliminary Exploration of Optimized Stack Code Generation|journal=Journal of Forth applications and Research|year=1994|volume=6|issue=3|url=http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/stack_compiler/stack_co.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Bailey|first=Chris|title=Inter-Boundary Scheduling of Stack Operands: A preliminary Study|journal=Proceedings of Euroforth 2000 Conference|year=2000|url=http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/anton/euroforth/ef00/bailey00.pdf}}</ref> and potentially performance, whilst global optimisation within the compiler itself achieves further gains.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shannon|first=Mark|author2=Bailey C |title=Global Stack Allocation : Register Allocation for Stack Machines|journal=Proceedings of Euroforth Conference 2006|year=2006|url=http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/anton/euroforth2006/papers/shannon.pdf}}</ref>\n\n====Simple interpreters====\nSome stack machine instruction sets are intended for interpretive execution of a virtual machine, rather than driving hardware directly.  Interpreters for virtual stack machines are easier to build than interpreters for register or memory-to-memory machines; the logic for handling memory address modes is in just one place rather than repeated in many instructions.  Stack machines also tend to have fewer variations of an opcode; one generalized opcode will handle both frequent cases and obscure corner cases of memory references or function call setup.  (But code density is often improved by adding short and long forms for the same operation.)\n\n====Fast operand access====\nSince there are no operand fields to decode, stack machines fetch each instruction and its operands at same time. Stack machines can omit the operand fetching stage of a register machine.<ref name=\"koopman89\" /> In addition, except explicit load from memory instructions, the order of operand usage is identical with the order of the operands in the data stack. So excellent prefetching is accomplished easily by keeping operands on the top of stack in fast storage. For example, in the [[Java Optimized Processor]] (JOP) microprocessor the top 2 operands of stack directly enter a data forwarding circuit that is faster than the register file.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jopdesign.com/doc/stack.pdf|format=PDF|title=Design and Implementation of an Efficient Stack Machine|website=Jopdesign.com|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n=====Avoids data passing through memory, faster interpreters=====\nFast access is also useful for interpreters. Most register interpreters specify their registers by number. But a host machine's registers can't be accessed in an indexed array, so a memory array is allotted for virtual registers. Therefore, the instructions of a register interpreter must use memory for passing generated data to the next instruction. This forces register interpreters to be much slower on microprocessors made with a fine process rule (i.e. faster transistors without improving circuit speeds, such as the Haswell x86). These require several clocks for memory access, but only one clock for register access. In the case of a stack machine with a data forwarding circuit instead of a register file, stack interpreters can allot the host machine's registers for the top several operands of the stack instead of the host machine's memory.\n\n====Minimal processor state====\nA machine with an expression stack can get by with just two registers that are visible to a programmer: The top-of-stack address and the next-instruction address.  The minimal hardware implementation has far fewer bits of flipflops or registers.  Faster designs can simply buffer the topmost N stack cells into registers to reduce memory stack cycles.\n\nResponding to an interrupt involves saving the registers to a stack, and then branching to the interrupt handler code.  In a stack machine, most parameters are already on a stack.  Therefore, there is no need to push them there.  Often stack machines respond more quickly to interrupts.  Some register machines deal with this by having multiple register files that can be instantly swapped<ref>8051 CPU Manual, Intel, 1980</ref> but this increases costs and slows down the register file.\n\n===Performance disadvantages of stack machines===\n====More memory references====\nSome in the industry believe that stack machines execute more [[data cache]] cycles for temporary values and local variables than do register machines.<ref>\"Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach\", John L Hennessy, David A Patterson; See the discussion of stack machines.</ref>\n\nOn stack machines, temporary values often get spilled into memory, whereas on machines with many registers these temps usually remain in registers.  (However, these values often need to be spilled into \"activation frames\" at the end of a procedure's definition, basic block, or at the very least, into a memory buffer during interrupt processing).  Values spilled to memory add more cache cycles.  This spilling effect depends on the number of hidden registers used to buffer top-of-stack values, upon the frequency of nested procedure calls, and upon host computer interrupt processing rates.\n\nSome simple stack machines or stack interpreters use no top-of-stack hardware registers.  Those minimal implementations are always slower than standard register machines.  A typical expression such as {{code|X+1}} compiles to {{code|Load X}}; {{code|Load 1}}; {{code|Add}}.  This does implicit writes and reads of the memory stack which were not needed:\n* Load X, push to memory\n* Load 1, push to memory\n* Pop 2 values from memory, add, and push result to memory\nfor a total of 5 data cache references.\n\nThe next step up from this is a stack machine or interpreter with a single top-of-stack register.  The above code then does:\n* Load X into empty TOS register (if hardware machine), or\n* Push TOS register to memory, Load X into TOS register (if interpreter)\n* Push TOS register to memory, Load 1 into TOS register\n* Pop left operand from memory, add to TOS register and leave it there\nfor a total of 5 data cache references, worst-case.  Generally, interpreters don't track emptiness, because they don't have to\u2014anything below the stack pointer is a non-empty value, and the TOS cache register is always kept hot.  Typical Java interpreters do not buffer the top-of-stack this way, however, because the program and stack have a mix of short and wide data values.\n\nIf the hardwired stack machine has N registers to cache the topmost memory stack words, then all spills and refills are avoided in this example and there is only 1 data cache cycle, the same as for a register or accumulator machine.\n\nOn register machines using optimizing compilers, it is very common for the most-used local variables to remain in registers rather than in stack frame memory cells.  This eliminates most data cache cycles for reading and writing those values.  The development of \"stack scheduling\" for performing live-variable analysis, and thus retaining key variables on the stack for extended periods, helps this concern.\n\nOn the other hand, register machines must spill many of their registers to memory across nested procedure calls.  The decision of which registers to spill, and when, is made statically at compile time rather than on the dynamic depth of the calls.  This can lead to more data cache traffic than in an advanced stack machine implementation.\n\n====High cost of factoring out common subexpressions====\nIn register machines, a [[common subexpression]] (a subexpression which is used multiple times with the same result value) can be evaluated just once and its result saved in a fast register. The subsequent reuses have no time or code cost, just a register reference. This optimization speeds simple expressions (for example, loading variable X or pointer P) as well as less-common complex expressions.\n\nWith stack machines, in contrast, results can be stored in one of two ways. Firstly, results can be stored using a temporary variable in memory. Storing and subsequent retrievals cost additional instructions and additional data cache cycles. Doing this is only a win if the subexpression computation costs more in time than fetching from memory, which in most stack CPUs, almost always is the case. It is never worthwhile for simple variables and pointer fetches, because those already have the same cost of one data cache cycle per access. It is only marginally worthwhile for expressions such as {{code|X+1}}. These simpler expressions make up the majority of redundant, optimizable expressions in programs written in non-concatenative languages. An optimizing compiler can only win on redundancies that the programmer could have avoided in the source code.\n\nThe second way leaves a computed value on the data stack, duplicating it as needed. This uses operations to copy stack entries. The stack must be depth shallow enough for the CPU's available copy instructions. Hand-written stack code often uses this approach, and achieves speeds like general-purpose register machines.<ref name=\"koopman89\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/stack_computers/|title=Stack Computers: the new wave -- an on-line book|website=Ece.cmu.edu|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://fpgacpu.ca/stack/Second-Generation_Stack_Computer_Architecture.pdf|format=PDF|title=Second-Generation Stack Computer Architecture|website=Fpgacpu.ca|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~laforest/Second-Generation_Stack_Computer_Architecture.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718112702/http://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~laforest/Second-Generation_Stack_Computer_Architecture.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-18 }} </ref> Unfortunately, algorithms for optimal \"stack scheduling\" are not in wide use by programming languages.\n\n====Rigid code order====\nIn modern machines, the time to fetch a variable from the data cache is often several times longer than the time needed for basic ALU operations.  A program runs faster without stalls if its memory loads can be started several cycles before the instruction that needs that variable.  Complex machines can do this with a deep pipeline and \"out-of-order execution\" that examines and runs many instructions at once.  Register machines can even do this with much simpler \"in-order\" hardware, a shallow pipeline, and slightly smarter compilers. The load step becomes a separate instruction, and that instruction is statically scheduled much earlier in the code sequence.  The compiler puts independent steps in between.\n\nScheduling memory accesses requires explicit, spare registers.  It is not possible on stack machines without exposing some aspect of the micro-architecture to the programmer.  For the expression A-B, the right operand must be evaluated and pushed immediately prior to the Minus step.  Without stack permutation or hardware multithreading, relatively little useful code can be put in between while waiting for the Load B to finish.  Stack machines can work around the memory delay by either having a deep out-of-order execution pipeline covering many instructions at once, or more likely, they can permute the stack such that they can work on other workloads while the load completes, or they can interlace the execution of different program threads, as in the Unisys A9 system.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/burroughs/A-Series/1170057_aSeries_Intro_apr86.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110321233311/http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/burroughs/A-Series/1170057_aSeries_Intro_apr86.pdf |archivedate=2011-03-21 }} </ref>  Today's increasingly parallel computational loads suggests, however, this might not be the disadvantage it's been made out to be in the past.\n\n=====Able to use out-of-order execution=====\nThe [[Tomasulo algorithm]] finds [[instruction-level parallelism]] by issuing instructions as their data becomes available.  Conceptually, the addresses of positions in a stack are no different than the register indexes of a register file.  This view permits the [[out-of-order execution]] of the Tomasulo algorithm to be used with stack machines.\n\nOut-of-order execution in stack machines seems to reduce or avoid many theoretical and practical difficulties.<ref name=\"boost\">{{cite web|last1=Chatterji|first1=Satrajit|last2=Ravindran|first2=Kaushik|title=BOOST: Berkeley's Out of Order Stack Thingie|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228556746_BOOST_Berkeley's_Out-of-Order_Stack_Thingy|website=Research Gate|publisher=Kaushik Ravindran|accessdate=16 February 2016|ref=boost}}</ref> The cited research shows that such a stack machine can exploit instruction-level parallelism, and the resulting hardware must cache data for the instructions. Such machines effectively bypass most memory accesses to the stack.  The result achieves throughput (instructions per [[Clock rate|clock]]) comparable to [[RISC]] register machines, with much higher code densities (because operand addresses are implicit).\n\nA stack machine's compact code naturally fits more instructions in cache, and therefore could achieve better [[CPU cache|cache]] efficiency, reducing memory costs or permitting faster memory systems for a given cost. In addition, most stack-machine instruction is very simple, made from only one opcode field or one operand field. Thus, stack-machines require very little electronic resources to decode each instruction.\n\nOne issue brought up in the research was that it takes about 1.88 stack-machine instructions to do the work of a register machine's RISC instruction.\nCompetitive out-of-order stack machines therefore require about twice as many electronic resources to track instructions (\"issue stations\"). This might be compensated by savings in instruction cache and memory and instruction decoding circuits.\n\n====Hides a faster register machine inside====\nSome simple stack machines have a chip design which is fully customized all the way down to the level of individual registers.  The top of stack address register and the N top of stack data buffers are built from separate individual register circuits, with separate adders and ad hoc connections.\n\nHowever, most stack machines are built from larger circuit components where the N data buffers are stored together within a register file and share read/write buses.  The decoded stack instructions are mapped into one or more sequential actions on that hidden register file. Loads and ALU ops act on a few topmost registers, and implicit spills and fills act on the bottommost registers. The decoder allows the instruction stream to be compact.  But if the code stream instead had explicit register-select fields which directly manipulated the underlying register file, the compiler could make better use of all registers and the program would run faster.\n\n[[Microcode|Microprogrammed]] stack machines are an example of this.  The inner microcode engine is some kind of RISC-like register machine or a [[VLIW]]-like machine using multiple register files.  When controlled directly by task-specific microcode, that engine gets much more work completed per cycle than when controlled indirectly by equivalent stack code for that same task.\n\nThe object code translators for the [[HP 3000]] and [[Tandem Computers|Tandem]] T/16 are another example.<ref>{{cite journal|title=HP3000 Emulation on HP Precision Architecture Computers|author1=Arndt Bergh|author2=Keith Keilman|author3=Daniel Magenheimer|author4=James Miller|journal=Hewlett-Packard Journal|date=December 1987|pages=87-89|url=http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/pdfs/IssuePDFs/1987-12.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref><ref>Migrating a CISC Computer Family onto RISC via Object Code Translation, K. Andrews and D. Sand, Proceedings of ASPLOS-V, October, 1992</ref>\nThey translated stack code sequences into equivalent sequences of RISC code.  Minor 'local' optimizations removed much of the overhead of a stack architecture.  Spare registers were used to factor out repeated address calculations.  The translated code still retained plenty of emulation overhead from the mismatch between original and target machines. Despite that burden, the cycle efficiency of the translated code matched the cycle efficiency of the original stack code.  And when the source code was recompiled directly to the register machine via optimizing compilers, the efficiency doubled.  This shows that the stack architecture and its non-optimizing compilers were wasting over half of the power of the underlying hardware.\n\nRegister files are good tools for computing because they have high bandwidth and very low latency, compared to memory references via data caches.  In a simple machine, the register file allows reading two independent registers and writing of a third, all in one ALU cycle with one-cycle or less latency.  Whereas the corresponding data cache can start only one read or one write (not both) per cycle, and the read typically has a latency of two ALU cycles.  That's one third of the throughput at twice the pipeline delay.  In a complex machine like [[Athlon]] that completes two or more instructions per cycle, the register file allows reading of four or more independent registers and writing of two others, all in one ALU cycle with one-cycle latency.  Whereas the corresponding dual-ported data cache can start only two reads or writes per cycle, with multiple cycles of latency.  Again, that's one third of the throughput of registers.  It is very expensive to build a cache with additional ports.\n\n====More instructions, slower interpreters====\nInterpreters for virtual stack machines are often slower than interpreters for other styles of virtual machine.<ref>{{cite web|title=\"Virtual Machine Showdown: Stack vs. Register Machine\"|author1=Yunhe Shi|author2=David Gregg|author3=Andrew Beatty|author4=M.

Every variable load or constant requires its own separate Load instruction, instead of being bundled within the instruction which uses that value.  The separated instructions may be simple and faster running, but the total instruction count is still higher.\n\nIn some interpreters, the interpreter must execute a N-way switch jump to decode the next opcode and branch to its steps for that particular opcode. Another method for selecting opcodes is [[threaded code]]. The host machine's prefetch mechanisms are unable to predict and fetch the target of that indexed or indirect jump.  So the host machine's execution pipeline must restart each time the hosted interpreter decodes another virtual instruction.  This happens more often for virtual stack machines than for other styles of virtual machine.<ref>{{cite web|title='The Case for Virtual Register Machines'|author1=Brian Davis|author2=Andrew Beatty|author3=Kevin Casey|author4=David Gregg|author5=John Waldron|url=http://www.scss.tcd.ie/David.Gregg/papers/Gregg-SoCP-2005.pdf|format=PDF|website=Scss.tcd.ie|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nAndroid's [[Dalvik (software)|Dalvik]] virtual machine for Java uses a virtual-register 16-bit instruction set instead of Java's usual 8-bit stack code, to minimize instruction count and opcode dispatch stalls.

The stack machine code must reload the object pointer for each pointer+offset calculation. A common fix for this is to add some register-machine features to the stack machine: a visible register file dedicated to holding addresses, and register-style instructions for doing loads and simple address calculations. It is uncommon to have the registers be fully general purpose, because then there is no strong reason to have an expression stack and postfix instructions.\n\nAnother common hybrid is to start with a register machine architecture, and add another memory address mode which emulates the push or pop operations of stack machines: 'memaddress = reg; reg += instr.displ'. This was first used in [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]]'s [[PDP-11]] minicomputer. This feature was carried forward in [[VAX]] computers and in [[Motorola 6800]] and [[Motorola 68000|M68000]] microprocessors. This allowed the use of simpler stack methods in early compilers. It also efficiently supported virtual machines using stack interpreters or [[threaded code]]. However, this feature did not help the register machine's own code to become as compact as pure stack machine code. Also, the execution speed was less than when compiling well to the register architecture. It is faster to change the top-of-stack pointer only occasionally (once per call or return) rather than constantly stepping it up and down throughout each program statement, and it is even faster to avoid memory references entirely.\n\nMore recently, so-called second-generation stack machines have adopted a dedicated collection of registers to serve as address registers, off-loading the task of memory addressing from the data stack. For example, MuP21 relies on a register called \"A\", while the more recent GreenArrays processors relies on two registers: A and B.\n\nThe Intel x86 family of microprocessors have a register-style (accumulator) instruction set for most operations, but use stack instructions for its [[x87]], [[Intel 8087]] floating point arithmetic, dating back to the iAPX87 (8087) coprocessor for the 8086 and 8088. That is, there are no programmer-accessible floating point registers, but only an 80-bit wide, 8 deep stack. The x87 relies heavily on the x86 CPU for assistance in performing its operations.\n\n===Commercial stack machines===\n{{see also|High-level language computer architecture}}\nExamples of stack instruction sets directly executed in hardware include\n* The F18A architecture of the 144-processor GA144 chip from GreenArrays, Inc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenarraychips.com/home/documents/index.html#architecture,|title=GreenArrays, Inc. - Documents|website=Greenarraychips.com|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colorforth.com/inst.htm#colorForth,|title=\"Instruction set of the F18A cores (named  colorForth for historical reasons).\"|website=Colorforth.com|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenarraychips.com/|title=\"GreenArrays, Inc.\"|website=Greenarraychips.com|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref>\n* the [[Burroughs large systems]] architecture (since 1961)\n* the [[Xerox Daybreak | Xerox Dandelion]] introduced April 27, 1981, utilized a stack machine architecture to save memory.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mesa Processor Principles of Operation |url=http://www.digibarn.com/friends/alanfreier/princops/00yTableOfContents.html |website=DigiBarn Computer Museum |publisher=Xerox |accessdate=23 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=DigiBarn: The Xerox Star 8010 \"Dandelion\" |url=http://www.digibarn.com/collections/systems/xerox-8010/index.html |publisher=DigiBarn Computer Museum |accessdate=23 December 2019}}</ref>\n* the [[English Electric KDF9]] machine.

Each nested call creates a new '''stack frame''' in memory, which persists until that call completes.  This call-return stack may be entirely managed by the hardware via specialized address registers and special address modes in the instructions.  Or it may be merely a set of conventions followed by the compilers, using generic registers and register+offset address modes.  Or it may be something in between.\n\nSince this technique is now nearly universal, even on register machines, it is not helpful to refer to all these machines as stack machines.  That term is commonly reserved for machines which also use an expression stack and stack-only arithmetic instructions to evaluate the pieces of a single statement.\n\nComputers commonly provide direct, efficient access to the program's global variables and to the local variables of only the current innermost procedure or function, the topmost stack frame.  'Up level' addressing of the contents of callers' stack frames is usually not needed and not supported as directly by the hardware.  If needed, compilers support this by passing in frame pointers as additional, hidden parameters.\n\nSome Burroughs stack machines do support up-level refs directly in the hardware, with specialized address modes and a special 'display' register file holding the frame addresses of all outer scopes.  No subsequent computer lines have done this in hardware.  When [[Niklaus Wirth]] developed the first [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] compiler for the [[CDC 6000 series|CDC 6000]], he found that it was faster overall to pass in the frame pointers as a chain, rather than constantly updating complete arrays of frame pointers.  This software method also adds no overhead for common languages like C which lack up-level refs.\n\nThe same Burroughs machines also supported nesting of tasks or threads.  The task and its creator share the stack frames that existed at the time of task creation, but not the creator's subsequent frames nor the task's own frames.  This was supported by a [[Parent pointer tree|cactus stack]], whose layout diagram resembled the trunk and arms of a [[Saguaro]] cactus.  Each task had its own memory segment holding its stack and the frames that it owns.  The base of this stack is linked to the middle of its creator's stack.  In machines with a conventional flat address space, the creator stack and task stacks would be separate heap objects in one heap.\n\nIn some programming languages, the outer-scope data environments are not always nested in time.  These languages organize their procedure 'activation records' as separate heap objects rather than as stack frames appended to a linear stack.\n\nIn simple languages like [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]] that lack local variables and naming of parameters, stack frames would contain nothing more than return branch addresses and frame management overhead.  So their return stack holds bare return addresses rather than frames.  The return stack is separate from the data value stack, to improve the flow of call setup and returns.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Belt machine]]\n* [[Stack-oriented programming language]]\n* [[Concatenative programming language]]\n* [[Comparison of application virtual machines]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/stack_computers/ ''Stack Computers: the new wave'' book by Philip J.

In some cases, the term refers to a software scheme that simulates a stack machine.\n\nThe main difference from other computers is that most of its instructions operate on a [[stack (data structure)|pushdown stack]] of numbers rather than numbers held in [[processor registers]]. Because the operands used in the instructions are always in a known location, the top of the stack, the instructions themselves do not require [[memory address]]es or register numbers to supply their operands. This leads to an [[instruction set architecture]] (ISA) style known as a '''zero address format'''.<ref>{{cite magazine |first= Bob |last=Beard  |magazine= Computer RESURRECTION |date= Autumn 1997 |url=http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/CCS/res/res18.htm#c |title=The KDF9 Computer - 30 Years On}}</ref>\n\nStacks are not unique to stack machines; most [[programming language]]s make extensive use of stacks to support [[subroutine]]s and [[method call]]s. For this reason, stack machines more closely mimic the inner workings of the programs that run on them, assuming the programs are written in [[high level language]]s. This has led to a number of [[central processor unit]] designs that implement stack machines in order to provide higher performance. In practice, however, these designs have been outperformed by the traditional [[register machine]] systems, and have remained a niche player in the market.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Practical expression-stack machines==\nA \"stack machine\" is a computer that uses a last-in, first-out [[stack (data structure)|stack]] to hold short-lived temporary values. Most of its instructions assume that operands will be from the stack, and results placed in the stack.\n\nFor a typical instruction such as {{code|Add}} the computer takes both operands from the topmost (most recent) values of the stack. The computer replaces those two values with the sum, which the computer calculates when it performs the {{code|Add}} instruction.  The instruction's operands are \"popped\" off the stack, and its result(s) are then \"pushed\" back onto the stack, ready for the next instruction.   Most stack instructions have only an [[opcode]] commanding an operation, with no additional fields to identify a constant, register or memory cell.  The stack easily holds more than two inputs or more than one result, so a richer set of operations can be computed.  Integer constant operands are often pushed by separate {{code|Load Immediate}} instructions.  Memory is often accessed by separate {{code|Load}} or {{code|Store}} instructions containing a memory address or calculating the address from values in the stack.\n\nFor speed, a stack machine often implements some part of its stack with registers. To execute quickly, operands of the [[arithmetic logic unit]] (ALU) may be the top two registers of the stack and the result from the ALU is stored in the top register of the stack.  Some stack machines have a stack of limited size, implemented as a register file. The ALU will access this with an index. Some machines have a stack of unlimited size, implemented as an array in RAM accessed by a \"top of stack\" address register. This is slower, but the number of flip-flops is less, making a less-expensive, more compact CPU.  Its topmost N values may be [[Cache (computing)|cached]] for speed. A few machines have both an expression stack in memory and a separate register stack. In this case, software, or an interrupt may move data between them.\n\nThe [[instruction set]] carries out most ALU actions with postfix ([[reverse Polish notation]]) operations that work only on the expression stack, not on data registers or main memory cells. This can be very convenient for executing high-level languages, because most arithmetic expressions can be easily translated into postfix notation.\n\nIn contrast, [[register machine]]s hold temporary values in a small, fast array of [[Processor register|register]]s.  [[Accumulator machine]]s have only one general-purpose register.  [[Belt machine]]s use a FIFO queue to hold temporary values.  Memory-to-memory machines do not have any temporary registers usable by a programmer.\n\nStack machines may have their expression stack and their [[call stack|call-return stack]] separated or as one integrated structure. If they are separated, the instructions of the stack machine can be [[instruction pipelining|pipelined]] with fewer interactions and less design complexity. Usually it can run faster.\n\nSome technical handheld calculators use reverse Polish notation in their keyboard interface, instead of having parenthesis keys.  This is a form of stack machine.  The Plus key relies on its two operands already being at the correct topmost positions of the user-visible stack.\n\n===Advantages of stack machine instruction sets===\n====Very compact object code====\nIn stack machine code, the most frequent instructions consist of just an opcode selecting the operation.  This can easily fit in 6 bits or less.  Branches, load immediates, and load/store instructions require an argument field, but stack machines often arrange that the frequent cases of these still fit together with the opcode into a compact group of bits.  The selection of operands from prior results is done implicitly by ordering the instructions.  In contrast, register machines require two or three register-number fields per ALU instruction to select operands; the densest register machines average about 16 bits per instruction.\n\nThe instructions for accumulator or memory-to-memory machines are not padded out with multiple register fields.  Instead, they use compiler-managed anonymous variables for subexpression values.  These temporary locations require extra memory reference instructions which take more code space than for the stack machine, or even compact register machines.\n\nAll practical stack machines have variants of the load\u2013store opcodes for accessing [[local variable]]s and [[formal parameter]]s without explicit address calculations.  This can be by offsets from the current top-of-stack address, or by offsets from a stable frame-base register.  Register machines handle this with a register+offset address mode, but use a wider offset field.\n\n[[Instruction set#Code density|Dense machine code]] was very valuable in the 1960s, when main memory was very expensive and very limited even on mainframes. It became important again on the initially-tiny memories of minicomputers and then microprocessors. Density remains important today, for smartphone applications, applications downloaded into browsers over slow Internet connections, and in ROMs for embedded applications. A more general advantage of increased density is improved effectiveness of caches and instruction prefetch.\n\nSome of the density of [[Burroughs large systems#B6500|Burroughs B6700]] code was due to moving vital operand information elsewhere, to 'tags' on every data word or into tables of pointers.  The Add instruction itself was generic or polymorphic.  It had to fetch the operand to discover whether this was an integer add or floating point add.  The Load instruction could find itself tripping on an [[Addressing mode|indirect address]], or worse, a disguised call to a [[call-by-name]] [[thunk]] routine.  The generic opcodes required fewer opcode bits but made the hardware more like an interpreter, with less opportunity to pipeline the common cases.\n\n====Simple compilers====\nCompilers for stack machines are simpler and quicker to build than compilers for other machines.  Code generation is trivial and independent of prior or subsequent code. The picture shows the syntax tree corresponding to the example expression ''A''*(''B''-''C'')+(''D''+''E'').\n\n[[File:AST binary tree arith variables.svg|thumb|Binary syntax tree for the expression ''A''*(''B''-''C'') + (''D''+''E'')]]\n\nThe compiled code for a simple stack machine would take the form (corresponding to the expressions' reverse Polish notation ''A'' ''B'' ''C'' - * ''D'' ''E'' + +):\n\n                  # stack contents (leftmost = top):\n  push A          #           A\n  push B          #     B     A\n  push C          # C   B     A\n  subtract        #     B-C   A\n  multiply        #           A*(B-C)\n  push D          #     D     A*(B-C)\n  push E          # E   D     A*(B-C)\n  add             #     D+E   A*(B-C)\n  add             #           A*(B-C)+(D+E)\n\nThe arithmetic operations 'subtract', 'multiply', and 'add' act on the two topmost operands of the stack.\n\nSuch simple compilation can be done by the parsing pass.  No register management is needed. Most stack machines can copy stack entries to avoid memory access (which is much slower), but these are usually trivial.  The same opcode that handles the frequent common case of an add, an indexed load, or a function call will also handle the general case involving complex subexpressions and nested calls. The compiler and the CPU do not need special cases for instructions that have separate calculation paths for addresses.\n\nThis simplicity has allowed compilers to fit onto very small machines.  The simple compilers allowed new product lines to get to market quickly, and allowed new operating systems to be written entirely in a high level language rather than in assembly.  For example, the [[UCSD Pascal|UCSD p-System]] supported a complete student programming environment on early 8-bit microprocessors with poor instruction sets and little RAM, by compiling to a virtual stack machine rather than to the actual hardware.\n\nThe downside to the simplicity of compilers for stack machines, is that pure stack machines have fewer optimisations (see subsections in [[#Performance disadvantages of stack machines|\u00a7 performance disadvantages of stack machines]]). However optimisation of compiled stack code is quite possible. Back-end optimisation of compiler output has been demonstrated to significantly improve code,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Koopman|first=Philip|title=A Preliminary Exploration of Optimized Stack Code Generation|journal=Journal of Forth applications and Research|year=1994|volume=6|issue=3|url=http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/stack_compiler/stack_co.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Bailey|first=Chris|title=Inter-Boundary Scheduling of Stack Operands: A preliminary Study|journal=Proceedings of Euroforth 2000 Conference|year=2000|url=http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/anton/euroforth/ef00/bailey00.pdf}}</ref> and potentially performance, whilst global optimisation within the compiler itself achieves further gains.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shannon|first=Mark|author2=Bailey C |title=Global Stack Allocation : Register Allocation for Stack Machines|journal=Proceedings of Euroforth Conference 2006|year=2006|url=http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/anton/euroforth2006/papers/shannon.pdf}}</ref>\n\n====Simple interpreters====\nSome stack machine instruction sets are intended for interpretive execution of a virtual machine, rather than driving hardware directly.  Interpreters for virtual stack machines are easier to build than interpreters for register or memory-to-memory machines; the logic for handling memory address modes is in just one place rather than repeated in many instructions.  Stack machines also tend to have fewer variations of an opcode; one generalized opcode will handle both frequent cases and obscure corner cases of memory references or function call setup.  (But code density is often improved by adding short and long forms for the same operation.)\n\n====Fast operand access====\nSince there are no operand fields to decode, stack machines fetch each instruction and its operands at same time. Stack machines can omit the operand fetching stage of a register machine.<ref name=\"koopman89\" /> In addition, except explicit load from memory instructions, the order of operand usage is identical with the order of the operands in the data stack. So excellent prefetching is accomplished easily by keeping operands on the top of stack in fast storage. For example, in the [[Java Optimized Processor]] (JOP) microprocessor the top 2 operands of stack directly enter a data forwarding circuit that is faster than the register file.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jopdesign.com/doc/stack.pdf|format=PDF|title=Design and Implementation of an Efficient Stack Machine|website=Jopdesign.com|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n=====Avoids data passing through memory, faster interpreters=====\nFast access is also useful for interpreters. Most register interpreters specify their registers by number. But a host machine's registers can't be accessed in an indexed array, so a memory array is allotted for virtual registers. Therefore, the instructions of a register interpreter must use memory for passing generated data to the next instruction. This forces register interpreters to be much slower on microprocessors made with a fine process rule (i.e. faster transistors without improving circuit speeds, such as the Haswell x86). These require several clocks for memory access, but only one clock for register access. In the case of a stack machine with a data forwarding circuit instead of a register file, stack interpreters can allot the host machine's registers for the top several operands of the stack instead of the host machine's memory.\n\n====Minimal processor state====\nA machine with an expression stack can get by with just two registers that are visible to a programmer: The top-of-stack address and the next-instruction address.  The minimal hardware implementation has far fewer bits of flipflops or registers.  Faster designs can simply buffer the topmost N stack cells into registers to reduce memory stack cycles.\n\nResponding to an interrupt involves saving the registers to a stack, and then branching to the interrupt handler code.  In a stack machine, most parameters are already on a stack.  Therefore, there is no need to push them there.  Often stack machines respond more quickly to interrupts.  Some register machines deal with this by having multiple register files that can be instantly swapped<ref>8051 CPU Manual, Intel, 1980</ref> but this increases costs and slows down the register file.\n\n===Performance disadvantages of stack machines===\n====More memory references====\nSome in the industry believe that stack machines execute more [[data cache]] cycles for temporary values and local variables than do register machines.<ref>\"Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach\", John L Hennessy, David A Patterson; See the discussion of stack machines.</ref>\n\nOn stack machines, temporary values often get spilled into memory, whereas on machines with many registers these temps usually remain in registers.  (However, these values often need to be spilled into \"activation frames\" at the end of a procedure's definition, basic block, or at the very least, into a memory buffer during interrupt processing).  Values spilled to memory add more cache cycles.  This spilling effect depends on the number of hidden registers used to buffer top-of-stack values, upon the frequency of nested procedure calls, and upon host computer interrupt processing rates.\n\nSome simple stack machines or stack interpreters use no top-of-stack hardware registers.  Those minimal implementations are always slower than standard register machines.  A typical expression such as {{code|X+1}} compiles to {{code|Load X}}; {{code|Load 1}}; {{code|Add}}.  This does implicit writes and reads of the memory stack which were not needed:\n* Load X, push to memory\n* Load 1, push to memory\n* Pop 2 values from memory, add, and push result to memory\nfor a total of 5 data cache references.\n\nThe next step up from this is a stack machine or interpreter with a single top-of-stack register.  The above code then does:\n* Load X into empty TOS register (if hardware machine), or\n* Push TOS register to memory, Load X into TOS register (if interpreter)\n* Push TOS register to memory, Load 1 into TOS register\n* Pop left operand from memory, add to TOS register and leave it there\nfor a total of 5 data cache references, worst-case.  Generally, interpreters don't track emptiness, because they don't have to\u2014anything below the stack pointer is a non-empty value, and the TOS cache register is always kept hot.  Typical Java interpreters do not buffer the top-of-stack this way, however, because the program and stack have a mix of short and wide data values.\n\nIf the hardwired stack machine has N registers to cache the topmost memory stack words, then all spills and refills are avoided in this example and there is only 1 data cache cycle, the same as for a register or accumulator machine.\n\nOn register machines using optimizing compilers, it is very common for the most-used local variables to remain in registers rather than in stack frame memory cells.  This eliminates most data cache cycles for reading and writing those values.  The development of \"stack scheduling\" for performing live-variable analysis, and thus retaining key variables on the stack for extended periods, helps this concern.\n\nOn the other hand, register machines must spill many of their registers to memory across nested procedure calls.  The decision of which registers to spill, and when, is made statically at compile time rather than on the dynamic depth of the calls.  This can lead to more data cache traffic than in an advanced stack machine implementation.\n\n====High cost of factoring out common subexpressions====\nIn register machines, a [[common subexpression]] (a subexpression which is used multiple times with the same result value) can be evaluated just once and its result saved in a fast register. The subsequent reuses have no time or code cost, just a register reference. This optimization speeds simple expressions (for example, loading variable X or pointer P) as well as less-common complex expressions.\n\nWith stack machines, in contrast, results can be stored in one of two ways. Firstly, results can be stored using a temporary variable in memory. Storing and subsequent retrievals cost additional instructions and additional data cache cycles. Doing this is only a win if the subexpression computation costs more in time than fetching from memory, which in most stack CPUs, almost always is the case. It is never worthwhile for simple variables and pointer fetches, because those already have the same cost of one data cache cycle per access. It is only marginally worthwhile for expressions such as {{code|X+1}}. These simpler expressions make up the majority of redundant, optimizable expressions in programs written in non-concatenative languages. An optimizing compiler can only win on redundancies that the programmer could have avoided in the source code.\n\nThe second way leaves a computed value on the data stack, duplicating it as needed. This uses operations to copy stack entries. The stack must be depth shallow enough for the CPU's available copy instructions. Hand-written stack code often uses this approach, and achieves speeds like general-purpose register machines.<ref name=\"koopman89\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/stack_computers/|title=Stack Computers: the new wave -- an on-line book|website=Ece.cmu.edu|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://fpgacpu.ca/stack/Second-Generation_Stack_Computer_Architecture.pdf|format=PDF|title=Second-Generation Stack Computer Architecture|website=Fpgacpu.ca|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~laforest/Second-Generation_Stack_Computer_Architecture.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718112702/http://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~laforest/Second-Generation_Stack_Computer_Architecture.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-18 }} </ref> Unfortunately, algorithms for optimal \"stack scheduling\" are not in wide use by programming languages.\n\n====Rigid code order====\nIn modern machines, the time to fetch a variable from the data cache is often several times longer than the time needed for basic ALU operations.  A program runs faster without stalls if its memory loads can be started several cycles before the instruction that needs that variable.  Complex machines can do this with a deep pipeline and \"out-of-order execution\" that examines and runs many instructions at once.  Register machines can even do this with much simpler \"in-order\" hardware, a shallow pipeline, and slightly smarter compilers. The load step becomes a separate instruction, and that instruction is statically scheduled much earlier in the code sequence.  The compiler puts independent steps in between.\n\nScheduling memory accesses requires explicit, spare registers.  It is not possible on stack machines without exposing some aspect of the micro-architecture to the programmer.  For the expression A-B, the right operand must be evaluated and pushed immediately prior to the Minus step.  Without stack permutation or hardware multithreading, relatively little useful code can be put in between while waiting for the Load B to finish.  Stack machines can work around the memory delay by either having a deep out-of-order execution pipeline covering many instructions at once, or more likely, they can permute the stack such that they can work on other workloads while the load completes, or they can interlace the execution of different program threads, as in the Unisys A9 system.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/burroughs/A-Series/1170057_aSeries_Intro_apr86.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110321233311/http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/burroughs/A-Series/1170057_aSeries_Intro_apr86.pdf |archivedate=2011-03-21 }} </ref>  Today's increasingly parallel computational loads suggests, however, this might not be the disadvantage it's been made out to be in the past.\n\n=====Able to use out-of-order execution=====\nThe [[Tomasulo algorithm]] finds [[instruction-level parallelism]] by issuing instructions as their data becomes available.  Conceptually, the addresses of positions in a stack are no different than the register indexes of a register file.  This view permits the [[out-of-order execution]] of the Tomasulo algorithm to be used with stack machines.\n\nOut-of-order execution in stack machines seems to reduce or avoid many theoretical and practical difficulties.<ref name=\"boost\">{{cite web|last1=Chatterji|first1=Satrajit|last2=Ravindran|first2=Kaushik|title=BOOST: Berkeley's Out of Order Stack Thingie|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228556746_BOOST_Berkeley's_Out-of-Order_Stack_Thingy|website=Research Gate|publisher=Kaushik Ravindran|accessdate=16 February 2016|ref=boost}}</ref> The cited research shows that such a stack machine can exploit instruction-level parallelism, and the resulting hardware must cache data for the instructions. Such machines effectively bypass most memory accesses to the stack.  The result achieves throughput (instructions per [[Clock rate|clock]]) comparable to [[RISC]] register machines, with much higher code densities (because operand addresses are implicit).\n\nA stack machine's compact code naturally fits more instructions in cache, and therefore could achieve better [[CPU cache|cache]] efficiency, reducing memory costs or permitting faster memory systems for a given cost. In addition, most stack-machine instruction is very simple, made from only one opcode field or one operand field. Thus, stack-machines require very little electronic resources to decode each instruction.\n\nOne issue brought up in the research was that it takes about 1.88 stack-machine instructions to do the work of a register machine's RISC instruction.\nCompetitive out-of-order stack machines therefore require about twice as many electronic resources to track instructions (\"issue stations\"). This might be compensated by savings in instruction cache and memory and instruction decoding circuits.\n\n====Hides a faster register machine inside====\nSome simple stack machines have a chip design which is fully customized all the way down to the level of individual registers.  The top of stack address register and the N top of stack data buffers are built from separate individual register circuits, with separate adders and ad hoc connections.\n\nHowever, most stack machines are built from larger circuit components where the N data buffers are stored together within a register file and share read/write buses.  The decoded stack instructions are mapped into one or more sequential actions on that hidden register file. Loads and ALU ops act on a few topmost registers, and implicit spills and fills act on the bottommost registers. The decoder allows the instruction stream to be compact.  But if the code stream instead had explicit register-select fields which directly manipulated the underlying register file, the compiler could make better use of all registers and the program would run faster.\n\n[[Microcode|Microprogrammed]] stack machines are an example of this.  The inner microcode engine is some kind of RISC-like register machine or a [[VLIW]]-like machine using multiple register files.  When controlled directly by task-specific microcode, that engine gets much more work completed per cycle than when controlled indirectly by equivalent stack code for that same task.\n\nThe object code translators for the [[HP 3000]] and [[Tandem Computers|Tandem]] T/16 are another example.<ref>{{cite journal|title=HP3000 Emulation on HP Precision Architecture Computers|author1=Arndt Bergh|author2=Keith Keilman|author3=Daniel Magenheimer|author4=James Miller|journal=Hewlett-Packard Journal|date=December 1987|pages=87-89|url=http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/pdfs/IssuePDFs/1987-12.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref><ref>Migrating a CISC Computer Family onto RISC via Object Code Translation, K. Andrews and D. Sand, Proceedings of ASPLOS-V, October, 1992</ref>\nThey translated stack code sequences into equivalent sequences of RISC code.  Minor 'local' optimizations removed much of the overhead of a stack architecture.  Spare registers were used to factor out repeated address calculations.  The translated code still retained plenty of emulation overhead from the mismatch between original and target machines. Despite that burden, the cycle efficiency of the translated code matched the cycle efficiency of the original stack code.  And when the source code was recompiled directly to the register machine via optimizing compilers, the efficiency doubled.  This shows that the stack architecture and its non-optimizing compilers were wasting over half of the power of the underlying hardware.\n\nRegister files are good tools for computing because they have high bandwidth and very low latency, compared to memory references via data caches.  In a simple machine, the register file allows reading two independent registers and writing of a third, all in one ALU cycle with one-cycle or less latency.  Whereas the corresponding data cache can start only one read or one write (not both) per cycle, and the read typically has a latency of two ALU cycles.  That's one third of the throughput at twice the pipeline delay.  In a complex machine like [[Athlon]] that completes two or more instructions per cycle, the register file allows reading of four or more independent registers and writing of two others, all in one ALU cycle with one-cycle latency.  Whereas the corresponding dual-ported data cache can start only two reads or writes per cycle, with multiple cycles of latency.  Again, that's one third of the throughput of registers.  It is very expensive to build a cache with additional ports.\n\n====More instructions, slower interpreters====\nInterpreters for virtual stack machines are often slower than interpreters for other styles of virtual machine.<ref>{{cite web|title=\"Virtual Machine Showdown: Stack vs. Register Machine\"|author1=Yunhe Shi|author2=David Gregg|author3=Andrew Beatty|author4=M. Anton Ertle|url=http://usenix.org/events/vee05/full_papers/p153-yunhe.pdf|format=PDF|website=Usenix.org|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref> This slowdown is worst when running on host machines with deep execution pipelines, such as current x86 chips.\n\nA program has to execute more instructions when compiled to a stack machine than when compiled to a register machine or memory-to-memory machine.  Every variable load or constant requires its own separate Load instruction, instead of being bundled within the instruction which uses that value.  The separated instructions may be simple and faster running, but the total instruction count is still higher.\n\nIn some interpreters, the interpreter must execute a N-way switch jump to decode the next opcode and branch to its steps for that particular opcode. Another method for selecting opcodes is [[threaded code]]. The host machine's prefetch mechanisms are unable to predict and fetch the target of that indexed or indirect jump.  So the host machine's execution pipeline must restart each time the hosted interpreter decodes another virtual instruction.  This happens more often for virtual stack machines than for other styles of virtual machine.<ref>{{cite web|title='The Case for Virtual Register Machines'|author1=Brian Davis|author2=Andrew Beatty|author3=Kevin Casey|author4=David Gregg|author5=John Waldron|url=http://www.scss.tcd.ie/David.Gregg/papers/Gregg-SoCP-2005.pdf|format=PDF|website=Scss.tcd.ie|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nAndroid's [[Dalvik (software)|Dalvik]] virtual machine for Java uses a virtual-register 16-bit instruction set instead of Java's usual 8-bit stack code, to minimize instruction count and opcode dispatch stalls.  Arithmetic instructions directly fetch or store local variables via 4-bit (or larger) instruction fields.

The stack machine code must reload the object pointer for each pointer+offset calculation. A common fix for this is to add some register-machine features to the stack machine: a visible register file dedicated to holding addresses, and register-style instructions for doing loads and simple address calculations. It is uncommon to have the registers be fully general purpose, because then there is no strong reason to have an expression stack and postfix instructions.\n\nAnother common hybrid is to start with a register machine architecture, and add another memory address mode which emulates the push or pop operations of stack machines: 'memaddress = reg; reg += instr.displ'. This was first used in [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]]'s [[PDP-11]] minicomputer. This feature was carried forward in [[VAX]] computers and in [[Motorola 6800]] and [[Motorola 68000|M68000]] microprocessors. This allowed the use of simpler stack methods in early compilers. It also efficiently supported virtual machines using stack interpreters or [[threaded code]]. However, this feature did not help the register machine's own code to become as compact as pure stack machine code. Also, the execution speed was less than when compiling well to the register architecture. It is faster to change the top-of-stack pointer only occasionally (once per call or return) rather than constantly stepping it up and down throughout each program statement, and it is even faster to avoid memory references entirely.\n\nMore recently, so-called second-generation stack machines have adopted a dedicated collection of registers to serve as address registers, off-loading the task of memory addressing from the data stack. For example, MuP21 relies on a register called \"A\", while the more recent GreenArrays processors relies on two registers: A and B.\n\nThe Intel x86 family of microprocessors have a register-style (accumulator) instruction set for most operations, but use stack instructions for its [[x87]], [[Intel 8087]] floating point arithmetic, dating back to the iAPX87 (8087) coprocessor for the 8086 and 8088. That is, there are no programmer-accessible floating point registers, but only an 80-bit wide, 8 deep stack. The x87 relies heavily on the x86 CPU for assistance in performing its operations.\n\n===Commercial stack machines===\n{{see also|High-level language computer architecture}}\nExamples of stack instruction sets directly executed in hardware include\n* The F18A architecture of the 144-processor GA144 chip from GreenArrays, Inc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenarraychips.com/home/documents/index.html#architecture,|title=GreenArrays, Inc. - Documents|website=Greenarraychips.com|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colorforth.com/inst.htm#colorForth,|title=\"Instruction set of the F18A cores (named  colorForth for historical reasons).\"|website=Colorforth.com|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenarraychips.com/|title=\"GreenArrays, Inc.\"|website=Greenarraychips.com|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref>\n* the [[Burroughs large systems]] architecture (since 1961)\n* the [[Xerox Daybreak | Xerox Dandelion]] introduced April 27, 1981, utilized a stack machine architecture to save memory.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mesa Processor Principles of Operation |url=http://www.digibarn.com/friends/alanfreier/princops/00yTableOfContents.html |website=DigiBarn Computer Museum |publisher=Xerox |accessdate=23 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=DigiBarn: The Xerox Star 8010 \"Dandelion\" |url=http://www.digibarn.com/collections/systems/xerox-8010/index.html |publisher=DigiBarn Computer Museum |accessdate=23 December 2019}}</ref>\n* the [[English Electric KDF9]] machine.

Each nested call creates a new '''stack frame''' in memory, which persists until that call completes.  This call-return stack may be entirely managed by the hardware via specialized address registers and special address modes in the instructions.  Or it may be merely a set of conventions followed by the compilers, using generic registers and register+offset address modes.  Or it may be something in between.\n\nSince this technique is now nearly universal, even on register machines, it is not helpful to refer to all these machines as stack machines.  That term is commonly reserved for machines which also use an expression stack and stack-only arithmetic instructions to evaluate the pieces of a single statement.\n\nComputers commonly provide direct, efficient access to the program's global variables and to the local variables of only the current innermost procedure or function, the topmost stack frame.  'Up level' addressing of the contents of callers' stack frames is usually not needed and not supported as directly by the hardware.  If needed, compilers support this by passing in frame pointers as additional, hidden parameters.\n\nSome Burroughs stack machines do support up-level refs directly in the hardware, with specialized address modes and a special 'display' register file holding the frame addresses of all outer scopes.  No subsequent computer lines have done this in hardware.  When [[Niklaus Wirth]] developed the first [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] compiler for the [[CDC 6000 series|CDC 6000]], he found that it was faster overall to pass in the frame pointers as a chain, rather than constantly updating complete arrays of frame pointers.  This software method also adds no overhead for common languages like C which lack up-level refs.\n\nThe same Burroughs machines also supported nesting of tasks or threads.  The task and its creator share the stack frames that existed at the time of task creation, but not the creator's subsequent frames nor the task's own frames.  This was supported by a [[Parent pointer tree|cactus stack]], whose layout diagram resembled the trunk and arms of a [[Saguaro]] cactus.  Each task had its own memory segment holding its stack and the frames that it owns.  The base of this stack is linked to the middle of its creator's stack.  In machines with a conventional flat address space, the creator stack and task stacks would be separate heap objects in one heap.\n\nIn some programming languages, the outer-scope data environments are not always nested in time.  These languages organize their procedure 'activation records' as separate heap objects rather than as stack frames appended to a linear stack.\n\nIn simple languages like [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]] that lack local variables and naming of parameters, stack frames would contain nothing more than return branch addresses and frame management overhead.  So their return stack holds bare return addresses rather than frames.  The return stack is separate from the data value stack, to improve the flow of call setup and returns.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Belt machine]]\n* [[Stack-oriented programming language]]\n* [[Concatenative programming language]]\n* [[Comparison of application virtual machines]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/stack_computers/ ''Stack Computers: the new wave'' book by Philip J.
