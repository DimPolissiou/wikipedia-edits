On February 17, an e-mail from one participant indicated that the type of social gathering on the ''Diamond Princess'' cruise ship wasn't that different from a mall, school, or work environment. Another February 17 e-mail indicated that non-pharmaceutical interventions (\"NPI\") such as school and business closures would be difficult for local officials to direct without federal action to provide political cover. By the third week of February, the group had \"effectively concluded that the United States had already lost the fight to contain the virus, and that it needed to switch to mitigation\" such as NPI's. This was based on the \"realization that many people in the country were likely infected and capable of spreading the disease, but not showing any symptoms.\"  For instance, by the time of the European travel ban on March 11 (a containment strategy), the group considered such containment steps ineffective. Trump still had not directed NPI's as of March 11. As late as March 13, the CDC was still questioning the benefit of closing schools.

The need to eliminate the warlords was seen as necessary by both Mao Zedong and Chiang Kai-shek, but for different reasons. For Mao, their elimination would end the [[Feudalism in China|feudal system in China]], encouraging and preparing the country for [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialism]] and [[communism]]. For Chiang, the warlords were a great threat to the [[central government]]. This basic dissimilarity in motivation continued throughout the years of fighting against Japanese occupation in China, in spite of a common enemy.\n\nMao's Communist forces mobilized the peasantry in rural China against the Japanese, and at the time of the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender in 1945]] the Chinese Communist Party had built an army of nearly a million soldiers. The pressure Mao's forces placed on the Japanese benefitted the Soviet Union, and thus the CCP forces were supplied by the Soviets. The ideological unity of the CCP, and the experience acquired in fighting the Japanese, prepared it for the next battles against the Kuomintang. Though Chiang's forces were well equipped by the US, they lacked effective leadership, political unity and experience.  \n\nIn January 1949, Chiang Kai-shek stepped down as leader of the KMT and was replaced by his vice-president, [[Li Zongren]]. Li and Mao entered into negotiations for peace, but Nationalist hardliners rejected Mao's demands. \n\nThe Communist military capability was a deciding factor in resolving the impasse, and when Li sought an additional delay in mid-April 1949, the Chinese Red Army crossed the [[Yangtze]] (Chang) River. Chiang fled to the [[Geography of Taiwan|island of Formosa]] (Taiwan), where approximately 300,000 soldiers had already been [[Airlift|airlifted]]. \n\n== Relocation of forces and people ==\nOver the course of 4 months beginning in August 1948, the ROC leaders relocated the [[Republic of China Air Force]] to Taiwan,  taking over 80 flights and 3 ships.<ref name=\":3\" /> {{Interlanguage link|Chen Chin-chang|zh|\u9673\u9326\u660c|WD=}} writes in his book on the subject that an average of 50 or 60 planes flew daily between Taiwan and China transporting fuel and ammunition between August 1948 and December 1949.\n\nChiang also sent the [[Republic of China Navy|26 naval vessels]] of the Nationalist army to Taiwan. The final Communist assault against Nationalist forces began on {{Format date|1949|April|20}} and continued until the end of summer.

The amount of gold that was moved differs according to sources, but it is usually estimated as between three million to five million [[tael]]s (approximately 113.6-115.2 tons; one tael is 37.2 grams). Other than gold, KMT brought old relics, which are now kept in the [[National Palace Museum]] in Taipei, Taiwan. Some scholars say the movement of gold and treasure was one of a number of protective measures against the Japanese invasion and occupation, similar to how European governments transferred gold to other locations during World War II. \n\nThere are different opinions on treasures that are at Taiwan's national palace museum. Some in China view the relocation as looting. Others believe these treasures have been accidentally protected, and might have been lost forever due to the [[Four Olds]] campaign during the [[Cultural Revolution]].

His generals and admirals planned possible dates to deploy while soldiers and field officers prepared for battle, according to the government archives.\n\n=== Chronology ===\n'''April 1, 1961:'''  The year witnessed the advent of the Project National Glory. The office was built by the [[Republic of China Armed Forces]] together with the [[Ministry of National Defense (Republic of China)|Ministry of National Defense]] in the town of [[Sanxia District|Sanxia]], [[Taipei County]] (now a district in [[New Taipei City]]).  Army [[Lieutenant General]] Zhu Yuancong took the role of governor and officially launched the project to compose a prudent plan of operations to recover the lost territories in mainland China. At the same time, the establishment of {{Clarify span|Project Juguan|Is this the same as Project Guoguan?|date=December 2018}} came to light whereby military members began to work out a possible alliance with American troops to attack mainland China.\n\n'''April 1964:'''  During this year, Chiang Kai-shek arranged an ensemble of air-raid shelters and five military offices at [[Cihu Mausoleum#Lake and residence|Lake Cihu]] ({{Lang-zh|c=|s=|t=\u6148\u6e56}}), which served as a secret command centre. Following the establishment of Project National Glory, several sub-plans were put into place, such as the frontal area of the enemy, rear area special warfare, [[surprise attack]], take advantage of the counterattack, and assistance against tyranny. \n\nHowever, the [[United States Armed Forces]] and the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]], together with the [[United States Department of State|State Department]], strongly opposed Project National Glory; rejecting the KMT plan to retake mainland China. Thus, every week American troops checked the inventory of [[Republic of China Marine Corps]] [[Amphibious vehicle|amphibious landing vehicles]] used by ROC and ordered American military advisory group members to fly over the Project National Glory camp on scouting missions. These flyovers infuriated Chiang Kai-Shek.\n\n'''June 17, 1965:'''  Chiang Kai-shek visited the [[Republic of China Military Academy]] to convene with all mid level and higher officers to devise and launch the counterattack.\n\n'''June 24, 1965:'''  A multitude of soldiers{{How many|date=November 2018}} died during a training drill to feign a Communist attack on major naval bases in southern Taiwan near [[Zuoying District]]. The deaths that occurred during the happening were the first but not the last in Project National Glory.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n'''August 6, 1965:'''  A [[People's Liberation Army Navy]] [[torpedo boat]] ambushed and sunk 200 soldiers as the ''Zhangjiang'' naval warship carried out assignment Tsunami Number 1, in an attempt to transport [[special forces]] to the vicinity of the Eastern mainland Chinese coastal island of [[Dongshan Island|Dongshan]] to carry out an [[Intelligence gathering network|intelligence gathering]] operation.\n\n'''November 1965:'''  Chiang Kai-shek ordered two other naval vessels, the ''CNS Shan Hai'' and the ''CNS Lin Huai'' to pick up injured soldiers from Taiwan's offshore islands of [[Magong]] and [[Wuqiu, Kinmen|Wuqiu]]. Nonetheless, the vessels were attacked by 12 PRC ships, the Lin Huai sunk, and roughly 90 soldiers and sailors were [[killed in action]]. Surprised by the heavy loss of life in the naval battle at Magong, Chiang gave up all hope for Project National Glory.\n\nAfter several unsuccessful feigned invasions between August 1971 and June 1973, in the lead up to the main landings, the 1973 coup which witnessed [[Nie Rongzhen]]'s rise to power in Beijing{{clarify|date=January 2019}} drove Chiang to call off all further false attacks and commence full landing operations. Having said this, according to Gen Huang Chih-chung, who was an army colonel at the time and part of the planning process, Chiang Kai-shek never completely gave up the desire to recapture China; \"even when he died (in 1975), he was still hoping the international situation would change and that the Communists would be wiped out one day.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Failure and shift of focus to modernization ===\nThe failure of Chiang's Project National Glory changed the course of Chinese and Taiwanese history, forever altering [[Cross-Strait relations|China-Taiwan relations]].

(1950)]]\nIn late 1949, having been almost destroyed by the Chinese Communists, the Kuomintang relocated to Taiwan and reinvented itself. Not only did the KMT leadership build a new party, but it built a new polity on Taiwan that created economic prosperity. From August 1950 to October 1952, more than four hundred working meetings were held almost four times a week to discuss how to build a new political party and implement Nationalist government policies. On August 5, 1950, Chiang chose the Central Reform Committee (CRC) to serve as the party's core leadership for planning and acting. The CRC members were on average young with an average age of 47 and all had [[Academic degree|college degrees]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.policyarchive.org/handle/10207/11838|title=Breaking with the Past: The Kuomintang Central Reform Committee on Taiwan, 1950-52 - PolicyArchive|website=www.policyarchive.org|access-date=2018-07-16}}</ref>\n\nThe new CRC had six goals. \n\n# Make the KMT a [[revolutionary]] democratic party.\n# Recruit peasants, workers, youth, intellectuals, and capitalists.\n# Adhere to [[democratic centralism]].\n# Establish the [[work team]] as the basic organizational unit.\n# Maintain high standards of leadership and obey the party's decisions,\n# Adopt Dr. [[Sun Yat-sen]]\u2019s [[Three Principles of the People]] as the KMT's ideology.\n\nAll CRC members took an oath to fulfill the party's ultimate goals which is to get rid of the Communists and recover the Chinese mainland.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=CIA memorandum ollenhauer meeting 23 October 1952 October 21 1952 secret nara|last=|first=|date=|doi = 10.1163/9789004287648.useo_b03301}}</ref>\n\n=== Expanding the Party's social foundation ===\nHaving organized a cohesive, loyal party, Chiang Kai-shek wanted to extend its influence deep into Taiwan's society in order to broaden its social base. One way to do that was to select new members from different socioeconomic groups. Various party branch members were ordered to recruit new members, especially students and teachers. New members had to show loyalty to the KMT party, understand what the party represented, obey party principles, and perform services for the party. In return, the CRC promised to pay attention to society's needs, which helped the CRC define a clear political purpose. Party policy also targeted ways to improve ordinary people's [[living conditions]]. Having new party branches made up of people of similar social status was a strategy that improved relations with workers, business leaders, farmers, intellectuals.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moss|first=R.

By October 1952, KMT membership had reached nearly 282,000, compared to the 50,000 members who had fled to Taiwan. More significant, more than half the party members were Taiwanese.

They also prevented [[Communist Party of China|communist]] infiltration, and recruited new party members after investigating their backgrounds, in order to hold regular meetings to discuss party strategy. The new party, then, behaved very differently from the way it had before 1949, with its work teams having new managerial and training responsibilities. According to the KMT's new rules, all party members had to join a work team and attend its meetings so that the party leadership could discover who was loyal and active. According to one report, in the summer of 1952, the KMT's Taiwan provincial party headquarters had at least thirty thousand work-team units in the field, each unit having at least nine members who worked in various state agencies, areas of Taiwan, and occupations.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Current Publications Received|journal=The Social Studies|volume=43|issue=1|pages=47\u201348|doi=10.1080/00220973.1938.11017690|issn=0037-7996|year = 1952}}</ref> Gradually, the party expanded its influence in society and in the state.\n\n=== Local political reforms ===\nAn important KMT tactic was to promote limited, local-level political reforms to enhance the party's authority with the Taiwanese people. To legitimize the Republic of China (ROC) as the central government for all China, Taiwan's Nationalist government needed [[elected representatives]] for all China. Thus, in 1947 more than one thousand mainlanders in [[Nanking]] were [[Elections in the Republic of China|elected]] by the Chinese people as members of the [[National Assembly (Republic of China)|National Assembly]], [[Legislative Yuan]], and the [[Control Yuan]]. After coming to Taiwan, those representatives were permitted to hold their seats until the next ROC election could be held on the mainland, thus legitimizing the ROC's control of Taiwan.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wachman|first=Alan M.|title=Taiwan: A Political History.

However, having so many local elections in a year, many voters became convinced that the KMT wanted to advance [[Pluralist democracy|political pluralism]]. Party leaders tried to broaden their influence, while only slowly allowing opposing politicians to compete, by giving political lessons to teach voters how democracy should work. \n\nIn January 1951, the first elections for county and city council were held. In April, other elections followed for county and municipal offices. In December 1951, the [[Taiwan Provincial Consultative Council|Taiwan Provisional Provincial Assembly]] was organized.

The need to eliminate the warlords was seen as necessary by both Mao Zedong and Chiang Kai-shek, but for different reasons. For Mao, their elimination would end the [[Feudalism in China|feudal system in China]], encouraging and preparing the country for [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialism]] and [[communism]]. For Chiang, the warlords were a great threat to the [[central government]]. This basic dissimilarity in motivation continued throughout the years of fighting against Japanese occupation in China, in spite of a common enemy.\n\nMao's Communist forces mobilized the peasantry in rural China against the Japanese, and at the time of the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender in 1945]] the Chinese Communist Party had built an army of nearly a million soldiers. The pressure Mao's forces placed on the Japanese benefitted the Soviet Union, and thus the CCP forces were supplied by the Soviets. The ideological unity of the CCP, and the experience acquired in fighting the Japanese, prepared it for the next battles against the Kuomintang. Though Chiang's forces were well equipped by the US, they lacked effective leadership, political unity and experience.  \n\nIn January 1949, Chiang Kai-shek stepped down as leader of the KMT and was replaced by his vice-president, [[Li Zongren]]. Li and Mao entered into negotiations for peace, but Nationalist hardliners rejected Mao's demands. \n\nThe Communist military capability was a deciding factor in resolving the impasse, and when Li sought an additional delay in mid-April 1949, the Chinese Red Army crossed the [[Yangtze]] (Chang) River. Chiang fled to the [[Geography of Taiwan|island of Formosa]] (Taiwan), where approximately 300,000 soldiers had already been [[Airlift|airlifted]]. \n\n== Relocation of forces and people ==\nOver the course of 4 months beginning in August 1948, the ROC leaders relocated the [[Republic of China Air Force]] to Taiwan,  taking over 80 flights and 3 ships.<ref name=\":3\" /> {{Interlanguage link|Chen Chin-chang|zh|\u9673\u9326\u660c|WD=}} writes in his book on the subject that an average of 50 or 60 planes flew daily between Taiwan and China transporting fuel and ammunition between August 1948 and December 1949.\n\nChiang also sent the [[Republic of China Navy|26 naval vessels]] of the Nationalist army to Taiwan. The final Communist assault against Nationalist forces began on {{Format date|1949|April|20}} and continued until the end of summer.

Other than gold, KMT brought old relics, which are now kept in the [[National Palace Museum]] in Taipei, Taiwan. Some scholars say the movement of gold and treasure was one of a number of protective measures against the Japanese invasion and occupation, similar to how European governments transferred gold to other locations during World War II. \n\nThere are different opinions on treasures that are at Taiwan's national palace museum. Some in China view the relocation as looting.

His generals and admirals planned possible dates to deploy while soldiers and field officers prepared for battle, according to the government archives.\n\n=== Chronology ===\n'''April 1, 1961:'''  The year witnessed the advent of the Project National Glory. The office was built by the [[Republic of China Armed Forces]] together with the [[Ministry of National Defense (Republic of China)|Ministry of National Defense]] in the town of [[Sanxia District|Sanxia]], [[Taipei County]] (now a district in [[New Taipei City]]).  Army [[Lieutenant General]] Zhu Yuancong took the role of governor and officially launched the project to compose a prudent plan of operations to recover the lost territories in mainland China. At the same time, the establishment of {{Clarify span|Project Juguan|Is this the same as Project Guoguan?|date=December 2018}} came to light whereby military members began to work out a possible alliance with American troops to attack mainland China.\n\n'''April 1964:'''  During this year, Chiang Kai-shek arranged an ensemble of air-raid shelters and five military offices at [[Cihu Mausoleum#Lake and residence|Lake Cihu]] ({{Lang-zh|c=|s=|t=\u6148\u6e56}}), which served as a secret command centre. Following the establishment of Project National Glory, several sub-plans were put into place, such as the frontal area of the enemy, rear area special warfare, [[surprise attack]], take advantage of the counterattack, and assistance against tyranny. \n\nHowever, the [[United States Armed Forces]] and the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]], together with the [[United States Department of State|State Department]], strongly opposed Project National Glory; rejecting the KMT plan to retake mainland China. Thus, every week American troops checked the inventory of [[Republic of China Marine Corps]] [[Amphibious vehicle|amphibious landing vehicles]] used by ROC and ordered American military advisory group members to fly over the Project National Glory camp on scouting missions. These flyovers infuriated Chiang Kai-Shek.\n\n'''June 17, 1965:'''  Chiang Kai-shek visited the [[Republic of China Military Academy]] to convene with all mid level and higher officers to devise and launch the counterattack.\n\n'''June 24, 1965:'''  A multitude of soldiers{{How many|date=November 2018}} died during a training drill to feign a Communist attack on major naval bases in southern Taiwan near [[Zuoying District]]. The deaths that occurred during the happening were the first but not the last in Project National Glory.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n'''August 6, 1965:'''  A [[People's Liberation Army Navy]] [[torpedo boat]] ambushed and sunk 200 soldiers as the ''Zhangjiang'' naval warship carried out assignment Tsunami Number 1, in an attempt to transport [[special forces]] to the vicinity of the Eastern mainland Chinese coastal island of [[Dongshan Island|Dongshan]] to carry out an [[Intelligence gathering network|intelligence gathering]] operation.\n\n'''November 1965:'''  Chiang Kai-shek ordered two other naval vessels, the ''CNS Shan Hai'' and the ''CNS Lin Huai'' to pick up injured soldiers from Taiwan's offshore islands of [[Magong]] and [[Wuqiu, Kinmen|Wuqiu]]. Nonetheless, the vessels were attacked by 12 PRC ships, the Lin Huai sunk, and roughly 90 soldiers and sailors were [[killed in action]]. Surprised by the heavy loss of life in the naval battle at Magong, Chiang gave up all hope for Project National Glory.\n\nAfter several unsuccessful feigned invasions between August 1971 and June 1973, in the lead up to the main landings, the 1973 coup which witnessed [[Nie Rongzhen]]'s rise to power in Beijing{{clarify|date=January 2019}} drove Chiang to call off all further false attacks and commence full landing operations. Having said this, according to Gen Huang Chih-chung, who was an army colonel at the time and part of the planning process, Chiang Kai-shek never completely gave up the desire to recapture China; \"even when he died (in 1975), he was still hoping the international situation would change and that the Communists would be wiped out one day.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Failure and shift of focus to modernization ===\nThe failure of Chiang's Project National Glory changed the course of Chinese and Taiwanese history, forever altering [[Cross-Strait relations|China-Taiwan relations]].

Not only did the KMT leadership build a new party, but it built a new polity on Taiwan that created economic prosperity. From August 1950 to October 1952, more than four hundred working meetings were held almost four times a week to discuss how to build a new political party and implement Nationalist government policies. On August 5, 1950, Chiang chose the Central Reform Committee (CRC) to serve as the party's core leadership for planning and acting.

One way to do that was to select new members from different socioeconomic groups. Various party branch members were ordered to recruit new members, especially students and teachers. New members had to show loyalty to the KMT party, understand what the party represented, obey party principles, and perform services for the party. In return, the CRC promised to pay attention to society's needs, which helped the CRC define a clear political purpose. Party policy also targeted ways to improve ordinary people's [[living conditions]]. Having new party branches made up of people of similar social status was a strategy that improved relations with workers, business leaders, farmers, intellectuals.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moss|first=R.

They also prevented [[Communist Party of China|communist]] infiltration, and recruited new party members after investigating their backgrounds, in order to hold regular meetings to discuss party strategy. The new party, then, behaved very differently from the way it had before 1949, with its work teams having new managerial and training responsibilities. According to the KMT's new rules, all party members had to join a work team and attend its meetings so that the party leadership could discover who was loyal and active. According to one report, in the summer of 1952, the KMT's Taiwan provincial party headquarters had at least thirty thousand work-team units in the field, each unit having at least nine members who worked in various state agencies, areas of Taiwan, and occupations.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Current Publications Received|journal=The Social Studies|volume=43|issue=1|pages=47\u201348|doi=10.1080/00220973.1938.11017690|issn=0037-7996|year = 1952}}</ref> Gradually, the party expanded its influence in society and in the state.\n\n=== Local political reforms ===\nAn important KMT tactic was to promote limited, local-level political reforms to enhance the party's authority with the Taiwanese people. To legitimize the Republic of China (ROC) as the central government for all China, Taiwan's Nationalist government needed [[elected representatives]] for all China. Thus, in 1947 more than one thousand mainlanders in [[Nanking]] were [[Elections in the Republic of China|elected]] by the Chinese people as members of the [[National Assembly (Republic of China)|National Assembly]], [[Legislative Yuan]], and the [[Control Yuan]]. After coming to Taiwan, those representatives were permitted to hold their seats until the next ROC election could be held on the mainland, thus legitimizing the ROC's control of Taiwan.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wachman|first=Alan M.|title=Taiwan: A Political History.

Chiang Kai-shek believed that, in this authoritarian polity, local elections could promote [[Democracy in China|Taiwan's eventual democracy]]. People did not believe that the KMT would ever not interfere with such elections. However, having so many local elections in a year, many voters became convinced that the KMT wanted to advance [[Pluralist democracy|political pluralism]]. Party leaders tried to broaden their influence, while only slowly allowing opposing politicians to compete, by giving political lessons to teach voters how democracy should work. \n\nIn January 1951, the first elections for county and city council were held. In April, other elections followed for county and municipal offices. In December 1951, the [[Taiwan Provincial Consultative Council|Taiwan Provisional Provincial Assembly]] was organized. Its members were appointed by county and municipal assemblies.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kron, Jr, N F|date=1980-07-01|title=Development regulation changes local elected leaders can make to promote energy conservation|doi=10.2172/5865360|osti=5865360|url=https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5865360}}</ref> Through [[Martial law in Taiwan|martial law]] and the control of local election rules, the KMT won most of those local elections but claimed that [[free elections]] had been held. Chiang believed that enough [[liberty]] had been granted. Therefore, party leaders continued to emphasize that martial law was still necessary.\n\n== Views on the legality of the KMT takeover of Taiwan ==\nThere are opposing views on the legality of the KMT takeover of Taiwan. At the time of the retreat to Taiwan, the KMT maintained that they were a [[government in exile]]. The Chinese Communist government maintains to this day that the Republic of China on Taiwan is a renegade province that must eventually return to rule by the mainland.\n\nAccording to an article published in 1955 on the legal status of Taiwan, \"It has been charged that Chiang Kai-shek has no claim to the island because he is 'merely a fugitive quartering his army' there and besides, his is a government in exile.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Claude S.|title=The International Legal Status of Formosa|journal=The Western Political Quarterly|volume=10|issue=2|pages=276\u2013289|doi=10.2307/443689|jstor=443689|year=1957|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/68790/2/10.1177_106591295701000203.pdf}}</ref> Moreover, the [[Treaty of San Francisco]], which was officially signed by 48 nations on 8 September 1951, did not specify to whom Japan was ceding [[Geography of Taiwan|Taiwan]] and [[Pescadores]].  \n\nAccording to Professor Gene Hsiao, \"since the San Francisco Peace Treaty and the separate KMT treaty with Japan did not specify to whom Japan was ceding Taiwan and the Pescadores, the implication of the U.S. position was that legally, and insofar as the signatories of those two treaties were concerned, Taiwan became an 'ownerless' island and the KMT, by its own assent to the American policy, a foreign government-in-exile.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://homepage.usask.ca/~llr130/ctir1/ctir1.pdf|title=Let Taiwan be Taiwan|last=Marc J.

Meanwhile, Oregon held a special election in 2016 to fill an unexpired term.\n\nMany of the states holding gubernatorial elections [[Term limits in the United States#Gubernatorial term limits|have term limits]] which made some multi-term governors ineligible for re-election. Two [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] governors were term-limited while six incumbent Democratic governors were eligible for re-election. Among [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] governors, twelve were term-limited while eleven could seek re-election. One [[Independent politician|independent]] governor was eligible for re-election.\n\nElections were held in 26 of the 33 states with Republican governors, 9 of the 16 states with Democratic governors, 1 state (Alaska) with an independent governor, 2 territories (Guam and Northern Mariana Islands) with Republican governors, 1 territory (U.S. Virgin Islands) with an independent governor and the District of Columbia with a Democratic mayor. Incumbent state governors running to be reelected included 14 Republicans, 5 Democrats and 1 independent. Territorial incumbents running included one Republican and one independent. The incumbent Democratic mayor of Washington, D.C. also ran for re-election.\n\nDemocrats gained control of 9 state and territorial governorships that had previously been held by Republicans and an independent.

These predictions look at factors such as the strength of the incumbent (if the incumbent is running for re-election), the strength of the candidates, and the partisan leanings of the state (reflected in part by the state's [[Cook Partisan Voting Index]] rating). The predictions assign ratings to each seat, with the rating indicating the predicted advantage that a party has in winning that seat. Most election predictors use \"<u>tossup</u>\" to indicate that neither party has an advantage, \"<u>lean</u>\" to indicate that one party has a slight advantage, \"<u>likely\" or \"favored</u>\" to indicate that one party has a significant but not insurmountable advantage and \"<u>safe\" or \"solid</u>\" to indicate that one party has a near-certain chance of victory. Some predictions also include a \"<u>tilt</u>\" rating that indicates that one party has an advantage that is not quite as strong as the \"lean\" rating would indicate (except Fox News, where \"likely\" is the highest rating given). Governors whose names are in parentheses are not contesting the election.\n<!-- Colors:\nstyle=\"background:#f66\"|{{sort|104|Safe R}}\nstyle=\"background:#f99\"|{{sort|103|Likely R}}\nstyle=\"background:#fcc\"|{{sort|102|Lean R}}\nstyle=\"background:#fdd\"|{{sort|101|Tilt R}}\n{{sort|100|Tossup}}\nstyle=\"background:#ddf\"|{{sort|099|Tilt D}}\nstyle=\"background:#ccf\"|{{sort|098|Lean D}}\nstyle=\"background:#99f\"|{{sort|097|Likely D}}\nstyle=\"background:#66f\"|{{sort|096|Safe D}}\n-->\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- valign=bottom\n!

gubernatorial elections''' were held on November 6, 2018 in 36 states and three territories. These elections formed part of the [[2018 United States elections]]. Other coinciding elections were the [[2018 United States Senate elections]] and the [[2018 United States House of Representatives elections]]. The last regular gubernatorial elections for all but three of the states took place in [[2014 United States gubernatorial elections|2014]]. Governors in New Hampshire and Vermont serve two-year terms, meaning that their most recent gubernatorial elections took place in [[2016 United States gubernatorial elections|2016]]. Meanwhile, Oregon held a special election in 2016 to fill an unexpired term.\n\nMany of the states holding gubernatorial elections [[Term limits in the United States#Gubernatorial term limits|have term limits]] which made some multi-term governors ineligible for re-election. Two [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] governors were term-limited while six incumbent Democratic governors were eligible for re-election. Among [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] governors, twelve were term-limited while eleven could seek re-election. One [[Independent politician|independent]] governor was eligible for re-election.\n\nElections were held in 26 of the 33 states with Republican governors, 9 of the 16 states with Democratic governors, 1 state (Alaska) with an independent governor, 2 territories (Guam and Northern Mariana Islands) with Republican governors, 1 territory (U.S. Virgin Islands) with an independent governor and the District of Columbia with a Democratic mayor. Incumbent state governors running to be reelected included 14 Republicans, 5 Democrats and 1 independent. Territorial incumbents running included one Republican and one independent. The incumbent Democratic mayor of Washington, D.C. also ran for re-election.\n\nDemocrats gained control of 9 state and territorial governorships that had previously been held by Republicans and an independent. They picked up Republican-held open seats in the states of [[2018 Kansas gubernatorial election|Kansas]], [[2018 Maine gubernatorial election|Maine]], [[2018 Michigan gubernatorial election|Michigan]], [[2018 Nevada gubernatorial election|Nevada]] and [[2018 New Mexico gubernatorial election|New Mexico]], in addition to defeating Republican incumbents in [[2018 Illinois gubernatorial election|Illinois]] and [[2018 Wisconsin gubernatorial election|Wisconsin]] and not losing any seats of their own. Additionally, they won the Republican controlled territory of ([[2018 Guamanian gubernatorial election|Guam]]) and the independent controlled territory of the ([[2018 United States Virgin Islands gubernatorial election|U.S. Virgin Islands]]). Republicans won the governorship of [[2018 Alaska gubernatorial election|Alaska]] previously held by an independent.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/06/us/elections/results-governor-elections.html|title=Governor Election Results: Democrats Retake Several States|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 6, 2018|accessdate=December 11, 2018}}</ref> Democrats also won the total popular vote for the year's gubernatorial elections for the second year in a row.\n\n== Nominations ==\nIn 2018, all states held primary elections to decide major nominees for the general election.  California held a [[nonpartisan blanket primary]] to select nominees while the other 35 states held partisan primaries.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329020377|title=Changing Outcomes: Electoral Competition in the Gubernatorial Primaries of 2018|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-12-12}}</ref> Nominations were contested except in Democratic primaries in Pennsylvania, South Dakota and Alaska and in Republican primaries in New Mexico, Iowa, Maryland, New Hampshire and New York.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Because the primary did not yield a candidate winning the state-required minimum share of the vote, runoff elections were held for Republican nominations in South Carolina, Georgia and Oklahoma as well as for the Democratic nomination in Texas, four of the ten states with a runoff requirement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ballotpedia.org/Runoff_election|title=Runoff election|website=Ballotpedia|language=en|access-date=2018-12-12}}</ref> In Georgia and Oklahoma, the runoff reversed the order of finish in the first primary.\n\nOn average, there were 4.5 candidates per contested gubernatorial nomination and the average nominee received 61% of the vote cast.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> The extent of competition varied widely across primaries, both within and across states.

These predictions look at factors such as the strength of the incumbent (if the incumbent is running for re-election), the strength of the candidates, and the partisan leanings of the state (reflected in part by the state's [[Cook Partisan Voting Index]] rating). The predictions assign ratings to each seat, with the rating indicating the predicted advantage that a party has in winning that seat. Most election predictors use \"<u>tossup</u>\" to indicate that neither party has an advantage, \"<u>lean</u>\" to indicate that one party has a slight advantage, \"<u>likely\" or \"favored</u>\" to indicate that one party has a significant but not insurmountable advantage and \"<u>safe\" or \"solid</u>\" to indicate that one party has a near-certain chance of victory. Some predictions also include a \"<u>tilt</u>\" rating that indicates that one party has an advantage that is not quite as strong as the \"lean\" rating would indicate (except Fox News, where \"likely\" is the highest rating given). Governors whose names are in parentheses are not contesting the election.\n<!-- Colors:\nstyle=\"background:#f66\"|{{sort|104|Safe R}}\nstyle=\"background:#f99\"|{{sort|103|Likely R}}\nstyle=\"background:#fcc\"|{{sort|102|Lean R}}\nstyle=\"background:#fdd\"|{{sort|101|Tilt R}}\n{{sort|100|Tossup}}\nstyle=\"background:#ddf\"|{{sort|099|Tilt D}}\nstyle=\"background:#ccf\"|{{sort|098|Lean D}}\nstyle=\"background:#99f\"|{{sort|097|Likely D}}\nstyle=\"background:#66f\"|{{sort|096|Safe D}}\n-->\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- valign=bottom\n!

This is particularly true during periods of increasing scarcity and shortages ([[resource depletion|depletion and overconsumption of resources]]).\n\n==Classification==\n{{See also|United Nations Framework Classification for Resources}}\nThere are various methods of categorizing natural resources, these include source of origin, stage of development, and by their renewability.\n\nOn the basis of origin, natural resources may be divided into two types:\n\n* ''Biotic'' \u2014  Biotic resources are obtained from the [[biosphere]] (living and organic material), such as [[forest]]s and [[animal]]s, and the materials that can be obtained from them. [[Fossil fuel]]s such as [[coal]] and [[petroleum]] are also included in this category because they are formed from decayed organic matter.\n* ''Abiotic'' \u2013 Abiotic resources are those that come from non-living, non-organic material. Examples of abiotic resources include [[wikt:land|land]], fresh [[water]], [[air]], [[rare earth metals]] and heavy metals including [[ore]]s, such as, [[gold]], [[iron]], [[copper]], [[silver]], etc.\n\nConsidering their stage of development, natural resources may be referred to in the following ways:\n\n* ''Potential resources'' \u2014 Potential resources are those that may be used in the future\u2014for example, [[petroleum]] in sedimentary rocks that, until drilled out and put to use remains a ''potential'' resource\n* ''Actual resources'' \u2014 Those resources that have been surveyed, quantified and qualified and, are currently used\u2014development, such as [[wood processing]], depends on technology and cost\n* ''Reserve resources'' \u2014 The part of an actual resource that can be developed profitably in the future\n* ''Stock resources'' \u2014 Those that have been surveyed, but cannot be used due to lack of technology\u2014for example, [[hydrogen]]\n\nMany natural resources can be categorized as either renewable or non-renewable:\n\n* ''[[Renewable resources]]'' \u2014 Renewable resources can be replenished naturally. Some of these resources, like sunlight, air, wind, water, etc. are continuously available and their quantities are not noticeably affected by human consumption. Though many renewable resources do not have such rapid recovery rate, these resources are susceptible to depletion by over-use. Resources from a human use perspective are classified as renewable so long as the rate of replenishment/recovery exceeds that of the rate of consumption. They replenish easily compared to Non-renewable resources.\n* ''[[Non-renewable resources]]'' \u2013 Non-renewable resources either form slowly or do not naturally form in the environment. Minerals are the most common resource included in this category. From the human perspective, resources are non-renewable when their rate of consumption exceeds the rate of replenishment/recovery; a good example of this are fossil fuels, which are in this category because their rate of formation is extremely slow (potentially millions of years), meaning they are considered non-renewable.

Spike managed the band for ten bucks a week.  After limited success, Spike suggested he would join the band.  Eventually the band evolved from the Feather Merchants to  Spike Jones and His City Slickers.\n\nPorter was happy with being a creative force but not being the leader of a band.

He was brought in by Ray Johnson, who he had met at [[Oregon State University|Oregon State Agriculture College]]. They joined Marshall Smith and Dwight Snyder who had formed the Foursome in 1926.  Prior to Porter joing the group they had recorded for [[Columbia Records]]. The Foursome's biggest hit was the song [[Walkin' My Baby Back Home (song)|Walkin' My Baby Back Home]] in 1932.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1196067/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm, retrieved 4/11/20</ref>  There was one thing that separated the Foursome from the many, many other vocal quartettes in the USA; the Foursome also played Ocarinas in harmony, which was not an easy thing to do. When they were in Hollywood shooting [[Born to Dance]] (1936) Porter ran into [[Bing Crosby]].  Bing had met him in Spokane in the Twenties where Porter and Ray Johnson were musicians playing a gig in a dance band. Crosby liked the Foursome's singing, but realized the ocarinas, and also Porter's clarinet, could add a fresh sound to old songs.  He invited them to back him up on his radio show [[The Kraft Music Hall]].<ref>Bing Crosby: A Pocketful of Dreams-the Early Years, 1903-1940 Paperback, Gary Giddins,Back Bay Books; Reprint edition (October 8, 2002) {{ISBN|978-0316886451}}</ref> Bing also brought them into the recording studio to record songs for Decca such as [[Sweet Georgia Brown]]; Ida, Sweet as Apple Cider; My Honey's Loving Arms; [[Chinatown, My Chinatown]] and others in 1937. In 1938 they backed up Dick Powell on several recordings, and they backed up Bing on When the Bloom is on the Sage. They were even busier in 1939 backing up [[Pinky Tomlin]], Shirley Ross, Dick Powell and Bing.  One of the songs with Bing was the [[Johnny Burke]] and [[James V. Monaco|James V Monaco]] song \"Sweet Potato Piper,\" inspired by the Foursome, for the 1940 film [[The Road to Singapore]].<ref>https://adp.library.ucsb.edu/index.php/talent/detail/87222/Foursome_The_Vocal_group, retired 4/11/20</ref>\n\n== With Spike Jones ==\n\n[[Spike Jones]] played the drums on Foursome recordings.  Spike came up with idea that Porter should start a band.  Porter created The Feather Mechants, a six piece band, that did zany material, such as Freddie Fisher's Snickelfritz Band did. Spike managed the band for ten bucks a week.  After limited success, Spike suggested he would join the band.  Eventually the band evolved from the Feather Merchants to  Spike Jones and His City Slickers.\n\nPorter was happy with being a creative force but not being the leader of a band.  With the Slickers he could write songs, sing and play on records, and let Spike book the gigs.  Porter was the lead vocalist, and also played clarinet and arranged.<ref>https://www.allmusic.com/artist/king-jackson-mn0001191546, retrieved 4/11/20</ref> Among the songs Porter wrote. \"Siam\" and \"Pass the Biscuits Mirandy\" became part of the band's book.
