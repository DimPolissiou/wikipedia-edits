He was a scion of the [[Rathore]] clan. His father was [[Ganga Rathore of Marwar|Rao Ganga Ji]] and his mother was Rani Padmavati of [[Sirohi]]. Rao Maldev fought in the [[Battle of Khanwa]] as a young prince, the defeat at Khanwa greatly weakened all the Rajput kingdoms in India, but [[Marwar]] under Maldev's capable rule turned into a powerful Rajput Kingdom that resisted foreign rule and challenged them for northern supremacy. Maldev refused to ally with either the [[Sur Empire]] or the [[Mughal Empire]] after [[Humayun]] regained control of north India in 1555.

Consistent with his democratic ideals of education, Lindsay also warned of the dangers of training the specialist intellect in the natural sciences and the need to introduce elements of social sciences at university level by broadening the academic agenda.  Lindsay believed technological excesses sponsored by the state without a review of the social and political consequences had been a major contributor to Germany's downfall.  This was to heavily influence Keele's curriculum.<ref name=\"Kolbert13\">Kolbert (2000), p.13</ref> On 13 March 1946, Lindsay wrote to [[Walter Hamilton Moberly|Sir Walter Moberly]], chair of the [[University Grants Committee (UK)|University Grants Committee]] (UGC), suggesting the creation of a college \"on new lines\".<ref name=\"Kolbert19\">Kolbert (2000), p.19</ref> The committee wanted a university for the 20th century that could overcome the division between arts and sciences, and what Moberly was calling the \"evil of departmentalism\".  The UGC argued that \"The tasks of the modern citizen and the study of modern society should be central to the curriculum.\" North Staffordshire was seen as an ideal site since it \"presented many typical problems thrown up by modern industrial conglomerations, such as those posed by technical innovation in the pottery and mining industries.\" The college could become a \"social laboratory\" for industries and the local communities they catered for.<ref>{{Cite book|title=British Labour and Higher Education: Ideologies, Policies and Practice|last=Talor|first=Richard|publisher=Continuum|year=2011|isbn=978-0-8264-4094-5|location=London, UK|page=50|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n[[File:Keele University Clock House.jpg|alt=Keele University Clock House|thumb|left|Keele University Clock House]]\nNormal practice was for new colleges (such as Southampton, Exeter and Nottingham) to be launched without degree-awarding powers. Students would instead matriculate with and take [[external degree]]s from the [[University of London]]. Lindsay wanted to \"get rid of the London external degree\" and instead found a college with degree-awarding authority, as well as the power to set its own syllabus, perhaps acting under the sponsorship of an established university. This would allow the college to start afresh in the setting of its curriculum.  Lindsay wrote to the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford, tentatively requesting such sponsorship.<ref name=\"Kolbert19\" />\n\nAn exploratory committee was established by Stoke-on-Trent City Council, and, having secured public funding from the UGC in January 1948,<ref>Kolbert (2000), p.22, 30</ref> the committee acquired [[Keele Hall]] on the outskirts of Newcastle-under-Lyme from its owner, Ralph Sneyd.<ref name=\"Kolbert37\">Kolbert (2000), p.37</ref> The Hall was purchased together with the bulk of the Sneyd estate and a number of prefabricated structures erected by the Army during the [[Second World War]] for \u00a331,000.<ref name=\"Kolbert37\" />\n\nIn August 1949 the university college was granted the right to award its own degrees.<ref>Kolbert, JM ''Keele: The First 50 Years'', Melandrium Books; 2000. p39</ref>  The first graduate was [[George Eason]], who had studied mathematics at [[Birmingham University]] and gained a BSc in 1951.

Alternatives were considered, including \"The University of Stoke\" or \"Stoke-on-Trent\", but both were rejected because the estate is situated in the borough of [[Newcastle-under-Lyme]]. \"[[Staffordshire University]]\" was also discussed (this is now the name of the former North Staffordshire Polytechnic).<ref name=\"historyinkeelebuildings\">{{cite web|url=https://www.keele.ac.uk/thekeeleoralhistoryproject/historyinkeelebuildings/ |title=History in Keele Buildings |website=Keele.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-07-24}}</ref>\nThe university is a short distance west of the civil parish of Keele, and it was decided to name it after the village. It is the only establishment of higher education in the UK to be named after a village, and this has long attracted questions as to its location.  Together with Reading, Nottingham, Southampton, Hull, Exeter and Leicester, all university colleges founded a short time before or after the First World War, Keele was identified as one of the \"younger civic universities\" by the [[Robbins Report]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Derek Gillard |url=http://www.educationengland.org.uk/documents/robbins/robbins1963.html |title=Robbins Report 1963&nbsp;\u2013 full text |website=Educationengland.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-07-24}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968 the Royal Commission on Medical Education (1965\u201368) issued the Todd Report,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/1/5643/569 |title=The Todd Report\u2014Views of Royal College of Physicians |publisher=The BMJ |date=1969-03-01 |accessdate=2017-07-24}}</ref> which examined the possibility of a medical school being established at Keele. It was considered that North Staffordshire would be a good site, having a large local population and several hospitals. However, a minimum intake of 150 students each year would be necessary to make a medical school economically and educationally viable, and the university was at that time too small to support a medical school of this size.\n\nKeele's International Relations Department was founded in 1974 by Professor Alan James and was one of the first institutions to offer a full degree in the subject.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keele.ac.uk/spire/internationalrelations/|title=International Relations|website=Keele.ac.uk|accessdate=6 November 2016}}</ref> The Keele World Affairs Group, closely associated, followed suit in 1980.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.keele.ac.uk/keeleworldaffairs/|title=Keele World Affairs|website=Keele.ac.uk|accessdate=6 November 2016}}</ref> Keele's first female professor was appointed to the Chair of Social Work in 1976.<ref>Kolbert, J M ''Keele: The First 50 years'', Melandrium Books; 2000. p.177</ref> In 1978, Keele Department of Postgraduate Medicine was created, although it did not cater for undergraduate medical students.\n\n===Government funding cuts===\n[[File:Keele University Western Entrance.jpg|thumb||left|Keele University western entrance]]\nIn late 1985, after a series of cuts in university funding, Keele briefly considered merging with North Staffordshire Polytechnic, but negotiations collapsed.<ref>Walker, David 'Proposals Would Merge Britain's University of Keele with nearby Polytechnic of North Staffordshire'; Chronicle of Higher Education, 31, 10 (6 November 1985),39, 42</ref> In September 1983, the Secretary of State, via the UGC, had encouraged the idea, asserting that the most radical way of increasing the size of departments and diminishing their number is by the merger of institutions. At the time, Keele had a population of 2,700 students, compared to 6,000 at the less academically exclusive Polytechnic. [[Edwina Currie]], then Conservative MP for South Derbyshire, remarked, \"A university which is now below 3,000 students has got problems. It simply isn't big enough\".<ref>Kolbert (2000), p.221.</ref> [[Keele University Science & Business Park]] Ltd (KUSP Ltd) opened in 1986, partly to generate and diversify alternative sources of income.\n\nIn 1994, the Oswestry and North Staffordshire School of Physiotherapy (ONSSP), which had been a separate institution based at the Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital in [[Oswestry]], [[Shropshire]], merged with Keele University, becoming Keele's Department of Physiotherapy Studies (now School of [[School of Health and Rehabilitation (Keele University)|Health & Rehabilitation]]). It moved to the Keele University campus. In August 1995, Keele University merged with North Staffordshire College of Nursing and Midwifery, forming the new School of Nursing and Midwifery.\nIn 1998 and 1999 there was some controversy when the university decided to sell the Turner Collection, a valuable collection of printed mathematical books, including some which had belonged to and had been heavily annotated by [[Isaac Newton]], in order to fund major improvements to the university library. Senior university officials authorised the sale of the collection to a private buyer, with no guarantee that it would remain intact or within the UK. Although the sale was legal, it was unpopular among the academic community, and the controversy was fuelled by prolonged negative press coverage suggesting that the \u00a31m sale price was too low and that the collection was certain to be broken up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1998/dec/23/ameliagentleman|title=Fears grow that books from Newton's library may go abroad|last=Gentleman|first=Amelia|date=23 December 1998|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=21 November 2010}}</ref>\n\n===21st Century Developments===\n====New Schools of Medicine, Pharmacy, Nursing and Midwifery====\n[[Sir David Weatherall]] was named as Chancellor in 2000.

When the Templars were condemned and dissolved by the [[Council of Vienne]] in 1311, their possessions were annexed by the [[Knights Hospitallers]] until their dissolution by [[Henry VIII]].<ref>Ward, John 'The Borough of Stoke-upon-Trent, in the Commencement of the Reign of the Reign of her Most Gracious Majesty, Queen Victoria', 1843, W Lewis & Son, London</ref>  The estate was purchased from the Crown by the Sneyd family and remained their property until acquisition by the Stoke-on-Trent Corporation in 1948. Apart from increasing numbers of academic and residential buildings, other facilities include an [[astronomy|astronomical observatory]], [https://www.keele.ac.uk/discover/artskeele/ arts and cultural programme], [[arboretum]], Islamic centre, shops, caf\u00e9s and places to eat and drink.

From the onset, Christian worship was central to University life. Lindsay, first principal of the University College, was an ardent Christian preaching every Sunday in the Library Reading room of Keele Hall.<ref>Kolbert, JM ''Keele The First 50 Years : A Portrait of the University''; Melandrium Books, 2000</ref>  A permanent structure was required and the chapel was built in 1965.

This key particularity of the Keele curriculum led Michael Brawne to remark in 1966 that the university was \"the nearest thing in Britain to the small liberal arts college in the US\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Michael|first=Brawne|date=September 1966|title=Robbins and After: A Critical Survey|url=|journal=The Journal of the Royal Architecture Institute of Canada|volume=43|issue=10|pages=67|via=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Keele University Forest of Light.jpg|thumb|Keele University Forest of Light|alt=]]\n\nStandard three-year degrees were introduced in 1973<ref>Kolbert (2000), p.141</ref> and the numbers of students following the Foundation Year course have steadily dwindled since.

Reproduced in Kolbert (2000), pp.70\u201372</ref> Of the initial intake of 159 students in October 1950, 149 were resident on campus,<ref>Kolbert (2000), p.64</ref> and it was required of the first professors appointed that they should also be in residence.<ref>Kolbert (2000), p.41</ref>  With the expansion of the university, total residency has long since been abandoned, but the proportion of full-time students resident on campus remains above average at 62% in 2011.\n\n=== Faculties, departments and schools ===\nKeele's academic activities are organised into the following 3 faculties and schools:\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n!Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences!!Faculty of Natural Sciences!!Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences\n|-\n|\n*School of Humanities\n*Keele Business School\n*School of Law\n*School of Social, Political and Global Studies\n|\n*School of Computing & Mathematics\n*School of Life Sciences\n*School of Geography, Geology and the Environment\n*School of Chemical & Physical Sciences\n*School of Psychology\n*School of Veterinary Sciences\n\n|\n*School of Allied Health Professionals\n*School of [[Keele University Medical School|Medicine]]\n*School of Nursing & Midwifery\n*School of Pharmacy and Biomedical Engineering\n*School of Primary, Community and Social Care\n|}\n\nAll Keele's courses, with the exception of Medicine and Pharmacy, are modular, with the academic year divided into two semesters, with breaks at Christmas and Easter. There are approximately 14 students to every member of staff.\n\n==Governance==\nThe statutes of the university are laid out in its Royal Charter granted in 1962.  These describe the organisational structure and powers that allow the university to function and govern its affairs.  The Chancellor is appointed by an elected council every 5 years or until resignation and supplemented by a Pro-Chancellor and Deputy Pro-Chancellors.  The Vice-Chancellor, also appointed by the council, requires approval from the senate and is the principal academic and administrative officer of the university.

Consistent with his democratic ideals of education, Lindsay also warned of the dangers of training the specialist intellect in the natural sciences and the need to introduce elements of social sciences at university level by broadening the academic agenda.  Lindsay believed technological excesses sponsored by the state without a review of the social and political consequences had been a major contributor to Germany's downfall.  This was to heavily influence Keele's curriculum.<ref name=\"Kolbert13\">Kolbert (2000), p.13</ref> On 13 March 1946, Lindsay wrote to [[Walter Hamilton Moberly|Sir Walter Moberly]], chair of the [[University Grants Committee (UK)|University Grants Committee]] (UGC), suggesting the creation of a college \"on new lines\".<ref name=\"Kolbert19\">Kolbert (2000), p.19</ref> The committee wanted a university for the 20th century that could overcome the division between arts and sciences, and what Moberly was calling the \"evil of departmentalism\".  The UGC argued that \"The tasks of the modern citizen and the study of modern society should be central to the curriculum.\" North Staffordshire was seen as an ideal site since it \"presented many typical problems thrown up by modern industrial conglomerations, such as those posed by technical innovation in the pottery and mining industries.\" The college could become a \"social laboratory\" for industries and the local communities they catered for.<ref>{{Cite book|title=British Labour and Higher Education: Ideologies, Policies and Practice|last=Talor|first=Richard|publisher=Continuum|year=2011|isbn=978-0-8264-4094-5|location=London, UK|page=50|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n[[File:Keele University Clock House.jpg|alt=Keele University Clock House|thumb|left|Keele University Clock House]]\nNormal practice was for new colleges (such as Southampton, Exeter and Nottingham) to be launched without degree-awarding powers. Students would instead matriculate with and take [[external degree]]s from the [[University of London]]. Lindsay wanted to \"get rid of the London external degree\" and instead found a college with degree-awarding authority, as well as the power to set its own syllabus, perhaps acting under the sponsorship of an established university. This would allow the college to start afresh in the setting of its curriculum.  Lindsay wrote to the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford, tentatively requesting such sponsorship.<ref name=\"Kolbert19\" />\n\nAn exploratory committee was established by Stoke-on-Trent City Council, and, having secured public funding from the UGC in January 1948,<ref>Kolbert (2000), p.22, 30</ref> the committee acquired [[Keele Hall]] on the outskirts of Newcastle-under-Lyme from its owner, Ralph Sneyd.<ref name=\"Kolbert37\">Kolbert (2000), p.37</ref> The Hall was purchased together with the bulk of the Sneyd estate and a number of prefabricated structures erected by the Army during the [[Second World War]] for \u00a331,000.<ref name=\"Kolbert37\" />\n\nIn August 1949 the university college was granted the right to award its own degrees.<ref>Kolbert, JM ''Keele: The First 50 Years'', Melandrium Books; 2000. p39</ref>  The first graduate was [[George Eason]], who had studied mathematics at [[Birmingham University]] and gained a BSc in 1951.

Alternatives were considered, including \"The University of Stoke\" or \"Stoke-on-Trent\", but both were rejected because the estate is situated in the borough of [[Newcastle-under-Lyme]]. \"[[Staffordshire University]]\" was also discussed (this is now the name of the former North Staffordshire Polytechnic).<ref name=\"historyinkeelebuildings\">{{cite web|url=https://www.keele.ac.uk/thekeeleoralhistoryproject/historyinkeelebuildings/ |title=History in Keele Buildings |website=Keele.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-07-24}}</ref>\nThe university is a short distance west of the civil parish of Keele, and it was decided to name it after the village. It is the only establishment of higher education in the UK to be named after a village, and this has long attracted questions as to its location.  Together with Reading, Nottingham, Southampton, Hull, Exeter and Leicester, all university colleges founded a short time before or after the First World War, Keele was identified as one of the \"younger civic universities\" by the [[Robbins Report]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Derek Gillard |url=http://www.educationengland.org.uk/documents/robbins/robbins1963.html |title=Robbins Report 1963&nbsp;\u2013 full text |website=Educationengland.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-07-24}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968 the Royal Commission on Medical Education (1965\u201368) issued the Todd Report,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/1/5643/569 |title=The Todd Report\u2014Views of Royal College of Physicians |publisher=The BMJ |date=1969-03-01 |accessdate=2017-07-24}}</ref> which examined the possibility of a medical school being established at Keele. It was considered that North Staffordshire would be a good site, having a large local population and several hospitals. However, a minimum intake of 150 students each year would be necessary to make a medical school economically and educationally viable, and the university was at that time too small to support a medical school of this size.\n\nKeele's International Relations Department was founded in 1974 by Professor Alan James and was one of the first institutions to offer a full degree in the subject.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keele.ac.uk/spire/internationalrelations/|title=International Relations|website=Keele.ac.uk|accessdate=6 November 2016}}</ref> The Keele World Affairs Group, closely associated, followed suit in 1980.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.keele.ac.uk/keeleworldaffairs/|title=Keele World Affairs|website=Keele.ac.uk|accessdate=6 November 2016}}</ref> Keele's first female professor was appointed to the Chair of Social Work in 1976.<ref>Kolbert, J M ''Keele: The First 50 years'', Melandrium Books; 2000. p.177</ref> In 1978, Keele Department of Postgraduate Medicine was created, although it did not cater for undergraduate medical students.\n\n===Government funding cuts===\n[[File:Keele University Western Entrance.jpg|thumb||left|Keele University western entrance]]\nIn late 1985, after a series of cuts in university funding, Keele briefly considered merging with North Staffordshire Polytechnic, but negotiations collapsed.<ref>Walker, David 'Proposals Would Merge Britain's University of Keele with nearby Polytechnic of North Staffordshire'; Chronicle of Higher Education, 31, 10 (6 November 1985),39, 42</ref> In September 1983, the Secretary of State, via the UGC, had encouraged the idea, asserting that the most radical way of increasing the size of departments and diminishing their number is by the merger of institutions. At the time, Keele had a population of 2,700 students, compared to 6,000 at the less academically exclusive Polytechnic. [[Edwina Currie]], then Conservative MP for South Derbyshire, remarked, \"A university which is now below 3,000 students has got problems. It simply isn't big enough\".<ref>Kolbert (2000), p.221.</ref> [[Keele University Science & Business Park]] Ltd (KUSP Ltd) opened in 1986, partly to generate and diversify alternative sources of income.\n\nIn 1994, the Oswestry and North Staffordshire School of Physiotherapy (ONSSP), which had been a separate institution based at the Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital in [[Oswestry]], [[Shropshire]], merged with Keele University, becoming Keele's Department of Physiotherapy Studies (now School of [[School of Health and Rehabilitation (Keele University)|Health & Rehabilitation]]). It moved to the Keele University campus. In August 1995, Keele University merged with North Staffordshire College of Nursing and Midwifery, forming the new School of Nursing and Midwifery.\nIn 1998 and 1999 there was some controversy when the university decided to sell the Turner Collection, a valuable collection of printed mathematical books, including some which had belonged to and had been heavily annotated by [[Isaac Newton]], in order to fund major improvements to the university library. Senior university officials authorised the sale of the collection to a private buyer, with no guarantee that it would remain intact or within the UK. Although the sale was legal, it was unpopular among the academic community, and the controversy was fuelled by prolonged negative press coverage suggesting that the \u00a31m sale price was too low and that the collection was certain to be broken up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1998/dec/23/ameliagentleman|title=Fears grow that books from Newton's library may go abroad|last=Gentleman|first=Amelia|date=23 December 1998|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=21 November 2010}}</ref>\n\n===21st Century Developments===\n====New Schools of Medicine, Pharmacy, Nursing and Midwifery====\n[[Sir David Weatherall]] was named as Chancellor in 2000.

This key particularity of the Keele curriculum led Michael Brawne to remark in 1966 that the university was \"the nearest thing in Britain to the small liberal arts college in the US\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Michael|first=Brawne|date=September 1966|title=Robbins and After: A Critical Survey|url=|journal=The Journal of the Royal Architecture Institute of Canada|volume=43|issue=10|pages=67|via=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Keele University Forest of Light.jpg|thumb|Keele University Forest of Light|alt=]]\n\nStandard three-year degrees were introduced in 1973<ref>Kolbert (2000), p.141</ref> and the numbers of students following the Foundation Year course have steadily dwindled since.

There are approximately 14 students to every member of staff.\n\n==Governance==\nThe statutes of the university are laid out in its Royal Charter granted in 1962.  These describe the organisational structure and powers that allow the university to function and govern its affairs.  The Chancellor is appointed by an elected council every 5 years or until resignation and supplemented by a Pro-Chancellor and Deputy Pro-Chancellors.  The Vice-Chancellor, also appointed by the council, requires approval from the senate and is the principal academic and administrative officer of the university.

They would be employed in \u2018factories\u2019 (equivalent of the English [[workhouse]]) but often had to find their own accommodation, and would be under great pressure to pay for it with sexual services. In this way, all the women convicts tended to be regarded as prostitutes. But it is a popular misconception that they had originally been convicted of prostitution, as this was not a transportable offence.\n\n==Background==\n{{further|Bloody Code}}\nOwing to industrialisation and the growth of city-slums, as well as the unemployment of soldiers and sailors following the American War of Independence, England was experiencing a high crime rate around 1780. The prisons were overcrowded; there was no attempt to segregate the prisoners by their offence, age or sex.\n\nIn response to growing crime, the British government began to issue harsh punishments such as public hangings or [[exile]]. During the 18th and 19th centuries many prisoners were transported to Australia to carry out their sentence, a relatively small percentage of whom were women (between 1788 and 1852, male convicts outnumbered the female convicts six to one<ref>Hughes 244</ref>). Convict women varied from small children to old women, but the majority were in their twenties or thirties. The British Government called for more women of \u201cmarriageable\u201d age to be sent to Australia in order to promote family development for [[emancipated]] convicts and free [[settler]]s.\n\nDespite the belief that convict women during the transportation period were all prostitutes, no women were transported for that offence. The majority of women sent to Australia were convicted for what would now be considered minor offences (such as petty theft), most did not receive sentences of more than seven years. Many women were driven to prostitution upon their arrival in Australia as means of survival because they were often required to house themselves or buy clothing and bedding on their own.\n\n==Convict population of New South Wales during the period==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

Ships continued to transport convicts to Western Australia until 1868. The beginning of the transportation years brought ships at inconsistent times and the death rate on these ships remained high; in the [[Second Fleet (Australia)|Second Fleet]], 267 out of 1,006 prisoners died at sea. However, at the peak of transportation, the death rate was a little more than one percent.<ref>Hughes 145</ref>\n\n[[Ralph Clark]], an officer on board the [[Friendship (ship)|''Friendship'']] in the First Fleet, kept a journal of his journey to Australia.

Women used their bodies as a way of bettering their conditions. On the ''Lady Juliana'', a ship in the Second Fleet, female convicts began to pair off with the seamen. John Nicol, a Scottish steward recalled, \"Every man on board took a wife from among the convicts, they nothing loath.\"<ref>Hughes 251</ref> These relationships were not always just . Nicol himself expresses his desire to marry and bring back to England his convict \"wife\", Sarah Whitlam, after her release.\n\n==Female factories==\n[[File:Parramatta Female Factory.jpg|thumb|[[Parramatta Female Factory]], painted by [[Augustus Earle]], c. 1826]]\n[[File:Cascades Female Factory 1844.jpg|thumb|Detail of a lithograph by [[John Skinner Prout]] showing the [[Cascades Female Factory]], 1844]]\nFemale factories in Australia housed convict women who were awaiting assignment, [[pregnant]] or undergoing punishment. They were called factories because the women were expected to work and because they also employed free working women. Task work was established in female factories in 1849, requiring the occupants to do chores, needle-work and washing. If extra work was done, the convict's sentence might be shortened.<ref>[http://www.femalefactory.com.au/FFRG/hobart.htm Female Factory Research Group, \"Hobart Town Female Factory\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720064903/http://www.femalefactory.com.au/FFRG/hobart.htm |date=July 20, 2008 }}</ref> Punishments for misconduct in the factories were often humiliating, a common one was to shave the woman's head.\n\nConditions in these factories were miserable. In the [[Parramatta female factory]] the occupants were not given [[mattress]]es or blankets to sleep on and the social conditions inside were indecent.\n\nThe Parramatta female factory was the first built in Australia and was located in [[Parramatta]], New South Wales. The factory had room for only a third of the female prisoners; the rest had to find lodgings with the local settlers at some cost (usually about four shillings a week).<ref>Hughes 255</ref> Many women could only pay for this cost by offering sexual services. Their customers were usually the male convicts who came and left the factory as they pleased.\n\nIn 1819 [[Macquarie County, New South Wales|Macquarie]] had ex-convict Francis Greenway create a new design for the factory. This new design had the inmates divided into three categories: the \"general\", \"merit\" and \"crime\" class.<ref>Hughes 256</ref> The \"crime\" class women had their hair cropped as a mark of disgrace and were the incorrigibles. The \"merit\" or first class comprised women who had been well behaved for at least six months and women who had recently arrived from England. These girls were eligible to marry and eligible for assignment. The second or \"general\" class was made up of women who were sentenced for minor offences and could be transferred to the first class after a period of [[probation]]. This class consisted of many women who had become pregnant during their assigned service. The factory at Parramatta was a source of wives for settlers and emancipated convicts. With a written permit from the Reverend [[Samuel Marsden]] and a written note to the [[matron]], a [[bachelor]] could take his pick of a willing \"factory lass.\"\n\n==Family and marriage==\n[[Marriage]] between male and female convicts and raising a family was encouraged because of the government\u2019s intentions of developing a free colony. It was the objective of the British government to establish a [[colony]] in Australia rather than have it remain as a penal settlement. This compelled the government to send more women to Australia as a way of establishing a native population. On the arrival of 'female' ships, colonists would swarm to the dock to bargain for a [[domestic worker|servant]]. High-ranking officers had first pick. Some women were taken as [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]]es, others as servants. There were no legal ties for these assignments, so a settler could dismiss a convict woman freely. When this did occur, it created a class of woman who often resorted to prostitution in order to feed and house themselves properly.\n\nMale convicts had the chance to select a bride from the female factories by a system called 'convict courtship'. The male convicts came to the female factories to inspect the women, who had to line up for the occasion. If the male convict saw a woman that he liked, he made a motion at her to signal that he wanted to choose her. Most women accepted the offering. This process was often described as similar to the one in which slaves were selected.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Damousi|first1=Joy|title=Depraved and Disorderly|date=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0 521 58323 3}}</ref>\n\nThe Reverend Samuel Marsden categorized the women convicts into being married or prostitutes.

They would be employed in \u2018factories\u2019 (equivalent of the English [[workhouse]]) but often had to find their own accommodation, and would be under great pressure to pay for it with sexual services. In this way, all the women convicts tended to be regarded as prostitutes. But it is a popular misconception that they had originally been convicted of prostitution, as this was not a transportable offence.\n\n==Background==\n{{further|Bloody Code}}\nOwing to industrialisation and the growth of city-slums, as well as the unemployment of soldiers and sailors following the American War of Independence, England was experiencing a high crime rate around 1780. The prisons were overcrowded; there was no attempt to segregate the prisoners by their offence, age or sex.\n\nIn response to growing crime, the British government began to issue harsh punishments such as public hangings or [[exile]]. During the 18th and 19th centuries many prisoners were transported to Australia to carry out their sentence, a relatively small percentage of whom were women (between 1788 and 1852, male convicts outnumbered the female convicts six to one<ref>Hughes 244</ref>). Convict women varied from small children to old women, but the majority were in their twenties or thirties. The British Government called for more women of \u201cmarriageable\u201d age to be sent to Australia in order to promote family development for [[emancipated]] convicts and free [[settler]]s.\n\nDespite the belief that convict women during the transportation period were all prostitutes, no women were transported for that offence. The majority of women sent to Australia were convicted for what would now be considered minor offences (such as petty theft), most did not receive sentences of more than seven years. Many women were driven to prostitution upon their arrival in Australia as means of survival because they were often required to house themselves or buy clothing and bedding on their own.\n\n==Convict population of New South Wales during the period==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

Ships continued to transport convicts to Western Australia until 1868. The beginning of the transportation years brought ships at inconsistent times and the death rate on these ships remained high; in the [[Second Fleet (Australia)|Second Fleet]], 267 out of 1,006 prisoners died at sea. However, at the peak of transportation, the death rate was a little more than one percent.<ref>Hughes 145</ref>\n\n[[Ralph Clark]], an officer on board the [[Friendship (ship)|''Friendship'']] in the First Fleet, kept a journal of his journey to Australia. In his journal, he described the women on board as \"abandoned wenches\", contrasting their characteristics with the supposed virtues of his wife in England.<ref>{{cite book| title=[[The Fatal Shore]]| first=Robert| last=Hughes| authorlink=Robert Hughes (critic)| publisher=[[Alfred A.

Women used their bodies as a way of bettering their conditions. On the ''Lady Juliana'', a ship in the Second Fleet, female convicts began to pair off with the seamen. John Nicol, a Scottish steward recalled, \"Every man on board took a wife from among the convicts, they nothing loath.\"<ref>Hughes 251</ref> These relationships were not always just . Nicol himself expresses his desire to marry and bring back to England his convict \"wife\", Sarah Whitlam, after her release.\n\n==Female factories==\n[[File:Parramatta Female Factory.jpg|thumb|[[Parramatta Female Factory]], painted by [[Augustus Earle]], c. 1826]]\n[[File:Cascades Female Factory 1844.jpg|thumb|Detail of a lithograph by [[John Skinner Prout]] showing the [[Cascades Female Factory]], 1844]]\nFemale factories in Australia housed convict women who were awaiting assignment, [[pregnant]] or undergoing punishment. They were called factories because the women were expected to work and because they also employed free working women. Task work was established in female factories in 1849, requiring the occupants to do chores, needle-work and washing. If extra work was done, the convict's sentence might be shortened.<ref>[http://www.femalefactory.com.au/FFRG/hobart.htm Female Factory Research Group, \"Hobart Town Female Factory\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720064903/http://www.femalefactory.com.au/FFRG/hobart.htm |date=July 20, 2008 }}</ref> Punishments for misconduct in the factories were often humiliating, a common one was to shave the woman's head.\n\nConditions in these factories were miserable. In the [[Parramatta female factory]] the occupants were not given [[mattress]]es or blankets to sleep on and the social conditions inside were indecent.\n\nThe Parramatta female factory was the first built in Australia and was located in [[Parramatta]], New South Wales. The factory had room for only a third of the female prisoners; the rest had to find lodgings with the local settlers at some cost (usually about four shillings a week).<ref>Hughes 255</ref> Many women could only pay for this cost by offering sexual services. Their customers were usually the male convicts who came and left the factory as they pleased.\n\nIn 1819 [[Macquarie County, New South Wales|Macquarie]] had ex-convict Francis Greenway create a new design for the factory. This new design had the inmates divided into three categories: the \"general\", \"merit\" and \"crime\" class.<ref>Hughes 256</ref> The \"crime\" class women had their hair cropped as a mark of disgrace and were the incorrigibles. The \"merit\" or first class comprised women who had been well behaved for at least six months and women who had recently arrived from England. These girls were eligible to marry and eligible for assignment. The second or \"general\" class was made up of women who were sentenced for minor offences and could be transferred to the first class after a period of [[probation]]. This class consisted of many women who had become pregnant during their assigned service. The factory at Parramatta was a source of wives for settlers and emancipated convicts. With a written permit from the Reverend [[Samuel Marsden]] and a written note to the [[matron]], a [[bachelor]] could take his pick of a willing \"factory lass.\"\n\n==Family and marriage==\n[[Marriage]] between male and female convicts and raising a family was encouraged because of the government\u2019s intentions of developing a free colony. It was the objective of the British government to establish a [[colony]] in Australia rather than have it remain as a penal settlement. This compelled the government to send more women to Australia as a way of establishing a native population. On the arrival of 'female' ships, colonists would swarm to the dock to bargain for a [[domestic worker|servant]]. High-ranking officers had first pick. Some women were taken as [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]]es, others as servants. There were no legal ties for these assignments, so a settler could dismiss a convict woman freely. When this did occur, it created a class of woman who often resorted to prostitution in order to feed and house themselves properly.\n\nMale convicts had the chance to select a bride from the female factories by a system called 'convict courtship'. The male convicts came to the female factories to inspect the women, who had to line up for the occasion. If the male convict saw a woman that he liked, he made a motion at her to signal that he wanted to choose her. Most women accepted the offering. This process was often described as similar to the one in which slaves were selected.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Damousi|first1=Joy|title=Depraved and Disorderly|date=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0 521 58323 3}}</ref>\n\nThe Reverend Samuel Marsden categorized the women convicts into being married or prostitutes.

Their musical style is often considered to fall under the genres \"[[doom metal]]\", \"[[funeral doom]]\", and \"[[grindcore]]\".\n\n==Films==\n===Theatrical films===\n\n====''The Chipmunk Adventure'' (1987)====\n{{Main|The Chipmunk Adventure}}\nWhen [[David Seville]] goes off to [[Europe]] on a business trip, [[Alvin and the Chipmunks|the Chipmunks]], Alvin, Simon and Theodore, are left at home with their babysitter, Miss Beatrice Miller. While the three are playing an arcade game of ''Around the World in Thirty Days'' with [[the Chipettes]], Alvin and Brittany argue over which would win an actual race around the world, since Brittany beat Alvin in the video game. [[Diamond]] [[smugglers]] Claudia and Klaus Furschtein overhear the conversation and approach the children, telling them that they will provide them with the means for a real race around the world by [[hot air balloon]], with the winner receiving $100,000.\n\n====''Alvin and the Chipmunks'' (2007)====\n{{Main|Alvin and the Chipmunks (film)}}\nIn a tree farm, three musically inclined chipmunks, Alvin ([[Justin Long]]), the mischievous troublemaker, Simon ([[Matthew Gray Gubler]]), the smart one in the trio, and Theodore ([[Jesse McCartney]]) the chubby sweethearted chipmunk, find their tree cut down and are transported to Los Angeles. Once there, they meet frustrated songwriter David Seville ([[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]]), and despite a poor house-wrecking first impression, they impress him with their singing talent. Seeing the opportunity for success, both human and chipmunks make a pact for them to sing his songs. While that ambition proves a frustrating struggle with the difficult trio, the dream does come true after all. However, that success presents its own trials as their unscrupulous record executive, Ian Hawke ([[David Cross]]), plans to break up this family to exploit the boys. Can Dave and the Chipmunks discover what they really value amid the superficial glamour around them?\n\n====''Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel'' (2009)====\n{{Main|Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel}}\nPop sensations Alvin ([[Justin Long]]), Simon ([[Matthew Gray Gubler]]) and Theodore ([[Jesse McCartney]]) end up in the care of Dave Seville ([[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]])'s twenty-something cousin Toby ([[Zachary Levi]]). The boys must put aside music super stardom to return to school, and are tasked with saving the school's music program by winning the $25,000 prize in a battle of the bands. But the Chipmunks unexpectedly meet their match in three singing chipmunks known as The Chipettes\u2014Brittany ([[Christina Applegate]]), Jeanette ([[Anna Faris]]) and Eleanor ([[Amy Poehler]]). Romantic and musical sparks are ignited when the Chipmunks and Chipettes square off.\n\n====''Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked'' (2011)====\n{{Main|Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked}}\nDave ([[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]]), the Chipmunks, and the Chipettes enjoy fun and mischief on a luxury cruise before their seafaring vacation takes an unexpected detour to an uncharted island. Now, the harder Alvin ([[Justin Long]]) and friends search for a way back to civilization, the more obvious it becomes that they aren't alone on this secluded island paradise.\n\n====''Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip'' (2015)====\n{{Main|Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip}}\nThrough a series of misunderstandings, Alvin ([[Justin Long]]), Simon ([[Matthew Gray Gubler]]) and Theodore ([[Jesse McCartney]]) come to believe that Dave ([[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]]) is going to propose to his new girlfriend in Miami...and dump them. They have three days to get to him and stop the proposal, saving themselves not only from losing Dave but possibly from gaining a terrible stepbrother.\n\n===Direct-to-video films===\n\n====''Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet Frankenstein'' (1999)====\n{{Main|Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet Frankenstein}}\nWhen the Chipmunks take a break from their concert, they get lost, and eventually get locked inside the park. They find their way to the \"Frankenstein's Castle\" attraction, where a real [[Victor Frankenstein|Dr. Victor Frankenstein]] is working on his [[Frankenstein's monster|monster]]. The monster is brought to life, and the doctor sends it in pursuit of the Chipmunks. In their escape, the monster retrieves Theodore's dropped [[teddy bear]]. Now it's up to the Chipmunks to get back his teddy bear and do something to the monster.\n\n====''Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet the Wolfman'' (2000)====\n{{Main|Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet the Wolfman}}\nWhen Alvin has nightmares of meeting the [[Werewolf|Wolfman]], which led him waking up screaming in horror, Simon and Dave conclude that Alvin's been watching too many horror films at night. Alvin says that it is because their new neighbor, [[Larry Talbot|Lawrence Talbot]], creeps him out and speculates that he is hiding something. Theodore is having trouble with Nathan, a bully, and will not go to the principal, who plans to retire due to Alvin's daily mishaps, for help; Alvin sticks up for him, however.\n\n====''Little Alvin and the Mini-Munks'' (2003)====\n{{Main|Little Alvin and the Mini-Munks}}\nLa-Lu, a friend of David Seville, has put up a banner saying \"Welcome Chipmunks\" on the porch of her magic cottage. One of her friends, Gilda (a talking pessimistic  [[cockatoo]]) believes that having children around is a bad idea. PC (a talking laid back [[frog]] with a surfer dude accent who believes he is one kiss away from being [[Prince Charming]]) says that his mom used to say \"nothing warms up a home like children's laughter\". Dave arrives with Alvin, Brittany, Simon, Jeanette, Theodore, and Eleanor. Dave needs the weekend to himself to write a new song, and La-Lu is happy to have five pre-schoolers and a baby stay with her and her friends. Sam and Lou, two [[gopher (animal)|gophers]], report to the viewers at home about the feelings the characters are experiencing via going into their heads and viewing an abstract inner visual manifestation of what the characters are thinking and or feeling. Alvin doesn't like that Dave is gone, and La-Lu explains that she felt the same way when she was little and reassures him that Dave will return for him and the others soon.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office performance===\n\nThe live action animated films are the [[List of highest grossing live-action/animated films#Highest-grossing live-action/animated film franchises and series|highest-grossing live-action/animated film series]] and [[List of highest-grossing musicals|6th highest-grossing musicals film series]] of all time.

While the three are playing an arcade game of ''Around the World in Thirty Days'' with [[the Chipettes]], Alvin and Brittany argue over which would win an actual race around the world, since Brittany beat Alvin in the video game. [[Diamond]] [[smugglers]] Claudia and Klaus Furschtein overhear the conversation and approach the children, telling them that they will provide them with the means for a real race around the world by [[hot air balloon]], with the winner receiving $100,000.\n\n====''Alvin and the Chipmunks'' (2007)====\n{{Main|Alvin and the Chipmunks (film)}}\nIn a tree farm, three musically inclined chipmunks, Alvin ([[Justin Long]]), the mischievous troublemaker, Simon ([[Matthew Gray Gubler]]), the smart one in the trio, and Theodore ([[Jesse McCartney]]) the chubby sweethearted chipmunk, find their tree cut down and are transported to Los Angeles. Once there, they meet frustrated songwriter David Seville ([[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]]), and despite a poor house-wrecking first impression, they impress him with their singing talent. Seeing the opportunity for success, both human and chipmunks make a pact for them to sing his songs. While that ambition proves a frustrating struggle with the difficult trio, the dream does come true after all. However, that success presents its own trials as their unscrupulous record executive, Ian Hawke ([[David Cross]]), plans to break up this family to exploit the boys. Can Dave and the Chipmunks discover what they really value amid the superficial glamour around them?\n\n====''Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel'' (2009)====\n{{Main|Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel}}\nPop sensations Alvin ([[Justin Long]]), Simon ([[Matthew Gray Gubler]]) and Theodore ([[Jesse McCartney]]) end up in the care of Dave Seville ([[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]])'s twenty-something cousin Toby ([[Zachary Levi]]). The boys must put aside music super stardom to return to school, and are tasked with saving the school's music program by winning the $25,000 prize in a battle of the bands. But the Chipmunks unexpectedly meet their match in three singing chipmunks known as The Chipettes\u2014Brittany ([[Christina Applegate]]), Jeanette ([[Anna Faris]]) and Eleanor ([[Amy Poehler]]). Romantic and musical sparks are ignited when the Chipmunks and Chipettes square off.\n\n====''Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked'' (2011)====\n{{Main|Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked}}\nDave ([[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]]), the Chipmunks, and the Chipettes enjoy fun and mischief on a luxury cruise before their seafaring vacation takes an unexpected detour to an uncharted island. Now, the harder Alvin ([[Justin Long]]) and friends search for a way back to civilization, the more obvious it becomes that they aren't alone on this secluded island paradise.\n\n====''Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip'' (2015)====\n{{Main|Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip}}\nThrough a series of misunderstandings, Alvin ([[Justin Long]]), Simon ([[Matthew Gray Gubler]]) and Theodore ([[Jesse McCartney]]) come to believe that Dave ([[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]]) is going to propose to his new girlfriend in Miami...and dump them. They have three days to get to him and stop the proposal, saving themselves not only from losing Dave but possibly from gaining a terrible stepbrother.\n\n===Direct-to-video films===\n\n====''Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet Frankenstein'' (1999)====\n{{Main|Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet Frankenstein}}\nWhen the Chipmunks take a break from their concert, they get lost, and eventually get locked inside the park. They find their way to the \"Frankenstein's Castle\" attraction, where a real [[Victor Frankenstein|Dr. Victor Frankenstein]] is working on his [[Frankenstein's monster|monster]]. The monster is brought to life, and the doctor sends it in pursuit of the Chipmunks. In their escape, the monster retrieves Theodore's dropped [[teddy bear]]. Now it's up to the Chipmunks to get back his teddy bear and do something to the monster.\n\n====''Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet the Wolfman'' (2000)====\n{{Main|Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet the Wolfman}}\nWhen Alvin has nightmares of meeting the [[Werewolf|Wolfman]], which led him waking up screaming in horror, Simon and Dave conclude that Alvin's been watching too many horror films at night. Alvin says that it is because their new neighbor, [[Larry Talbot|Lawrence Talbot]], creeps him out and speculates that he is hiding something. Theodore is having trouble with Nathan, a bully, and will not go to the principal, who plans to retire due to Alvin's daily mishaps, for help; Alvin sticks up for him, however.\n\n====''Little Alvin and the Mini-Munks'' (2003)====\n{{Main|Little Alvin and the Mini-Munks}}\nLa-Lu, a friend of David Seville, has put up a banner saying \"Welcome Chipmunks\" on the porch of her magic cottage. One of her friends, Gilda (a talking pessimistic  [[cockatoo]]) believes that having children around is a bad idea. PC (a talking laid back [[frog]] with a surfer dude accent who believes he is one kiss away from being [[Prince Charming]]) says that his mom used to say \"nothing warms up a home like children's laughter\". Dave arrives with Alvin, Brittany, Simon, Jeanette, Theodore, and Eleanor. Dave needs the weekend to himself to write a new song, and La-Lu is happy to have five pre-schoolers and a baby stay with her and her friends. Sam and Lou, two [[gopher (animal)|gophers]], report to the viewers at home about the feelings the characters are experiencing via going into their heads and viewing an abstract inner visual manifestation of what the characters are thinking and or feeling. Alvin doesn't like that Dave is gone, and La-Lu explains that she felt the same way when she was little and reassures him that Dave will return for him and the others soon.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office performance===\n\nThe live action animated films are the [[List of highest grossing live-action/animated films#Highest-grossing live-action/animated film franchises and series|highest-grossing live-action/animated film series]] and [[List of highest-grossing musicals|6th highest-grossing musicals film series]] of all time.
