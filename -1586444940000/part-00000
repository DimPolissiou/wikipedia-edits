{"title_page": "History of Denmark", "text_new": "{{Scandinavia|History}}\nThe '''history of Denmark''' as a unified kingdom began in the 8th century, but historic documents describe the geographic area and the people living there\u2014the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]]\u2014as early big but as 500 AD. These early Big ass booty documents include the writings of [[Jordanes]] and [[Procopius]]. With the [[Christianization of Scandinavia#Denmark|Christianization of the Danes]] c. 960 AD, it is clear that there existed a kingship. Queen [[Margrethe II]] can trace her lineage back to the [[Viking]] kings [[Gorm the Old]] and [[Harald Bluetooth]] from this time, thus making the [[Monarchy of Denmark]] the oldest in Europe.<ref>http://madmonaco.blogspot.com/2010/06/oldest-monarchy.html http://www.royalinsight.net/content/danish-monarchy-overview {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015221435/http://royalinsight.net/content/danish-monarchy-overview |date=2012-10-15 }}</ref> The area now known as [[Denmark]] has a rich [[prehistory]], having been populated by several prehistoric cultures and people for about 12,000 years, since the end of the [[Paleolithic|last ice age]].\n\nDenmark's history has particularly been influenced by its geographical location between the [[North Sea|North]] and [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] seas, a strategically and economically important placement between [[Sweden]] and [[Germany]], at the center of mutual struggles for control of the Baltic Sea (''[[dominium maris baltici]]''). Denmark was long in disputes with Sweden over control of [[Sk\u00e5nelandene]] and with Germany over control of [[Schleswig]] (a Danish [[fief]]) and [[Holstein]] (a German fief).\n\nEventually, Denmark lost these conflicts and ended up ceding first [[Sk\u00e5neland]] to Sweden and later [[Schleswig-Holstein]] to the [[German Empire]]. After the eventual cession of [[Norway in 1814]], Denmark retained control of the old Norwegian colonies of the [[Faroe Islands]], [[Greenland]] and [[Iceland]]. During the 20th century, Iceland gained independence, Greenland and the Faroese became integral parts of the [[Kingdom of Denmark]] and [[North Schleswig]] reunited with Denmark in 1920 after a referendum. During [[World War II]], Denmark was [[Occupation of Denmark|occupied]] by [[Nazi Germany]], but was eventually liberated by British forces of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in 1945,<ref>The remote Danish island of [[Bornholm]] in the Baltic Sea was liberated by Soviet forces of the Allies. This led to some political turmoil and conflict, occasionally resurfacing in modern times.</ref> after which it joined the [[United Nations]]. In the aftermath of World War II, and with the emergence of the subsequent [[Cold War]], Denmark was quick to join the military alliance of [[Member states of NATO|NATO]] as a founding member in 1949.\n\n== Prehistoric Denmark ==\n{{see also|Prehistory of Scandinavia}}\nThe Scandinavian region has a rich [[prehistory]], having been populated by several prehistoric cultures and people for about 12,000 years, since the end of the [[Weichselian glaciation|last ice age]]. During the ice age, all of Scandinavia was covered by [[glacier]]s most of the time, except for the southwestern parts of what we now know as Denmark. When the ice began retreating, the barren tundras were soon inhabited by reindeer and elk, and [[Ahrensburg culture|Ahrenburg]] and [[Swiderian culture|Swiderian]] hunters from the south followed them here to hunt occasionally. The geography then was very different from what we know today. Sea levels were much lower; the island of [[Great Britain]] was connected by a land bridge to mainland Europe and the large area between Great Britain and the [[Jutland|Jutlandic peninsula]] - now beneath the [[North Sea]] and known as [[Doggerland]] - was inhabited by tribes of hunter-gatherers. As the climate warmed up, forceful rivers of meltwater started to flow and shape the virgin lands, and more stable flora and fauna gradually began emerging in Scandinavia, and Denmark in particular. The first human settlers to inhabit Denmark and Scandinavia permanently were the [[Maglemosian culture|Maglemosian people]], residing in seasonal camps and exploiting the land, sea, rivers and lakes. It was not until around 6,000 BC that the approximate geography of Denmark as we know it today had been shaped.\n\nDenmark has some unique natural conditions for preservation of artifacts, providing [[Archaeology of Denmark|a rich and diverse archeological record]] from which to understand the prehistoric cultures of this area.\n\n=== Stone and Bronze Age ===\n[[File:Br\u00e6nde-Stene.jpg|400px|right|thumb|Stone Dolmen near Vinstrup, N\u00f8rhald. Built in the 3rd millennium BC.]]\n{{see also|Neolithic|Nordic Stone Age|Nordic Bronze Age}} \nThe [[Last glacial period|Weichsel glaciation]] covered all of Denmark most of the time, except the western coasts of Jutland. It ended around 13,000 years ago, allowing humans to move back into the previously ice-covered territories and establish permanent habitation. During the first post-glacial millennia, the landscape gradually changed from [[tundra]] to light forest, and varied fauna including now-extinct [[megafauna]] appeared. Early prehistoric cultures uncovered in modern Denmark include the [[Maglemosian Culture]] (9,500-6,000 BC); the [[Kongemose culture]] (6,000-5,200 BC), the [[Erteb\u00f8lle culture]] (5,300-3,950 BC), and the [[Funnelbeaker culture]] (4,100-2,800 BC).\n\n[[Image:Solvognen - Do 2010 1276.jpg|thumb|left|The famous [[Trundholm sun chariot]] (called ''[[Solvognen]]'' in Danish), a sculpture of the sun pulled by a mare. Scholars have dated it to some time in the 15th century BC and believe that it illustrates an important concept expressed in [[Nordic Bronze Age]] mythology.]]\nThe first inhabitants of this early post-glacial landscape in the so-called [[Boreal (period)|Boreal period]], were very small and scattered populations living from hunting of [[reindeer]] and other land mammals and gathering whatever fruits the climate was able to offer. Around 8,300 BC the temperature rose drastically, now with summer temperatures around 15 degrees Celsius, and the landscape changed into dense forests of [[aspen]], [[birch]] and [[pine]] and the reindeer moved north, while [[aurochs]] and [[moose|elk]] arrived from the south.

Eight of the 22 had died before reaching 20 years of age - testifying to the hardness of hunter-gatherer life in the cold north.<ref>Jensen 2003:24</ref> Based on estimates of the amount of game animals, scholars estimate the population of Denmark to have been between 3,300-8,000 persons in the time around 7,000 BC.<ref>Jensen 2003:32</ref> It is believed that the early hunter-gatherers lived nomadically, exploiting different environments at different times of the year, gradually shifting to the use of semi permanent base camps.<ref>Jensen 2003:34</ref>\n\nWith the rising temperatures, sea levels also rose, and during the [[Atlantic (period)|Atlantic period]], Denmark evolved from a contiguous landmass around 11,000 BC to a series of islands by 4,500 BC. The inhabitants then shifted to a seafood based diet, which allowed the population to increase.\n\n[[Agriculture|Agricultural]] settlers made inroads around 3,000 BC. Many [[dolmen]]s and rock tombs (especially [[passage grave]]s) date from this period. The [[Nordic Bronze Age]] period in Denmark, from about 1,500 BC, featured a culture that buried its dead, with their worldly goods, beneath [[Tumulus|burial mounds]]. The many finds of gold and bronze from this era include beautiful religious artifacts and musical instruments, and provide the earliest evidence of [[social class]]es and [[Social stratification|stratification]].\n\n{{clear left}}\n\n=== Iron Age ===\n{{see also|Nordic Iron Age}}\n[[File:Gundestrup cauldron - F.I.4277.jpg|thumb|The silver [[Gundestrup Cauldron]], with what some scholars interpret as Celtic depictions, exemplifies the trade relations of the period.]]\nDuring the [[Pre-Roman Iron Age]] (from the 4th to the 1st century BC), the climate in Denmark and southern [[Scandinavia]] became cooler and wetter, limiting agriculture and setting the stage for local groups to migrate southward into [[Germania]]. At around this time people began to extract iron from the [[bog iron|ore]] in [[peat bog]]s. Evidence of strong [[Celts|Celtic]] cultural influence dates from this period in Denmark, and in much of northwest Europe, and survives in some of the older place names.\n\nFrom the first to the fifth century, the [[Roman Empire]] interacted with Jutland and the Danish isles in many ways, ranging from commerce to a possible \"client state\" relationship.<ref>[http://researchomnia.blogspot.com/2015/08/roman-client-state-in-denmark.html Roman \"client state\" in Denmark]</ref> This period is therefore referred to as the Roman Iron Age.\n\nThe [[Roman Empire|Roman provinces]], whose frontiers stopped short of Denmark, nevertheless maintained trade routes and relations with Danish or proto-Danish peoples, as attested by finds of Roman coins. The earliest known [[runic]] inscription dates back to c. 200 AD. Depletion of cultivated land in the last century BC seems to have contributed to increasing migrations in northern Europe and increasing conflict between Teutonic tribes and Roman settlements in [[Gaul]]. Roman artifacts are especially common in finds from the 1st century. It seems clear that some part of the Danish warrior [[aristocracy]] served in the [[Roman army]].<ref>Birger Storgaard, ''Cosmopolitan aristocrats'', pp. 106-125 in: ''The Spoils of Victory - The North in the shadow of the Roman Empire'', Nationalmuseet, 2003. {{ISBN|87-7602-006-1}}.</ref>\n\nOccasionally during this time, both animal and [[human sacrifice]] occurred and bodies were immersed in [[bog]]s. In {{As of|2008|alt= recent times}} some of these [[bog body|bog bodies]] have emerged very well-preserved, providing valuable information about the religion and people who lived in Denmark during this period. Some of the most well-preserved bog bodies from the Nordic Iron Age are the [[Tollund Man]] and the [[Grauballe Man]].\n\nFrom around the 5th to the 7th century, [[Northern Europe]] experienced mass migrations. This period and its [[material culture]] are referred to as the [[Germanic Iron Age]].\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"160px\" heights=\"130\">\nFile:Tollundmannen.jpg|The face of Tollundmanden, one of the best preserved bog body finds.\nFile:Dejbjerg wagon, Nationalmuseet Copenhagen.jpg|The [[Dejbjerg wagon]] from the Pre-Roman Iron Age, thought to be a ceremonial wagon.\nFile:Nydamboat.2.jpg|The [[Nydam Mose|Nydam oak boat]], a [[ship burial]] from the Roman Iron Age.

The Danish people were among those known as [[Viking]]s, during the 8th\u201311th centuries. Viking explorers first discovered and settled in [[Iceland]] in the 9th century, on their way from the [[Faroe Islands]]. From there, [[Greenland]] and [[Vinland]] (probably [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]) were also settled. Utilizing their great skills in shipbuilding and navigation they raided and conquered parts of [[France]] and the [[British Isles]].\n\n[[File:Aros viking town.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The fortified Viking town of [[Aarhus|Aros]] ([[Aarhus]]), 950 AD.]]\nThey also excelled in trading along the coasts and rivers of Europe, running trade routes from Greenland in the north to [[Constantinople]] in the south via [[Russia]]n and [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] rivers, most notably along the River [[Dnieper]] and via Kiev, then being the capital of [[Kiev Rus]]. The Danish Vikings were most active in Britain, [[Ireland]], [[France]], [[Spain]], Portugal and Italy where they raided, conquered and settled (their earliest settlements included sites in the [[Danelaw]], [[Ireland]] and [[Normandy]]). The Danelaw encompassed the Northeastern half of what now constitutes [[England]], where Danes settled and Danish law and rule prevailed. Prior to this time, England consisted of approximately seven independent [[Anglo-Saxon]] kingdoms. The Danes conquered (terminated) all of these except for the kingdom of [[Wessex]]. [[Alfred the Great]], king of Wessex, emerged from these trials as the sole remaining English king, and thereby as the first English [[Monarch]].\n\nIn the early 9th century, [[Charlemagne]]'s Christian empire had expanded to the southern border of the Danes, and Frankish sources (e.g. [[Notker the Stammerer|Notker of St Gall]]) provide the earliest historical evidence of the Danes. These report a King [[Gudfred]], who appeared in present-day [[Holstein]] with a navy in 804 where diplomacy took place with the [[Franks]]; In 808, King Gudfred attacked the [[Obotrites]] and conquered the city of [[Reric]] whose population was displaced or abducted to [[Hedeby]]. In 809, King Godfred and emissaries of Charlemagne failed to negotiate peace, despite the sister of Godfred being a concubine of Charlemagne, and the next year King Godfred attacked the [[Frisians]] with 200 ships.\n\nViking raids along the coast of France and the Netherlands were large-scale. Paris was besieged and the Loire Valley devastated during the 10th century. One group of Danes was granted permission to settle in northwestern France under the condition that they defend the place from future attacks. As a result, the region became known as \"Normandy\" and it was the descendants of these settlers who conquered England in 1066.\n\n[[File:Dannevirke.english.png|thumb|left|upright=1.0|Map showing [[Danevirke]] and [[H\u00e6rvejen]].]]\nIn addition, a few Danes are believed to have participated with the Norwegians who moved west into the Atlantic Ocean, settling in the [[Shetland Isles]], the [[Faeroe Islands]], [[Iceland]], and [[Greenland]]. The Greenland Norse persisted from about 1000 AD to about 1450 AD. Seasonal trading camps have been recently discovered on [[Baffin Island]] containing European cordage, metal traces, masonry, and rat remains. Brief Viking expeditions to North America around 1000 did not result in any lasting settlements. Other Viking raids into Germany and the Mediterranean were short-lived and had no lasting effect.\n\nThe oldest parts of the defensive works of Danevirke near [[Hedeby]] at least date from the summer of 755 and were expanded with large works in the 10th century. The size and number of troops needed to man it indicates a quite powerful ruler in the area, which might be consistent with the kings of the Frankish sources. In 815 AD, Emperor [[Louis the Pious]] attacked Jutland apparently in support of a contender to the throne, perhaps [[Harald Klak]], but was turned back by the sons of Godfred, who most likely were the sons of the above-mentioned Godfred. At the same time [[Ansgar|St. Ansgar]] travelled to Hedeby and started the Catholic [[Christianisation of Scandinavia]].\n\n[[Gorm the Old]] ({{lang-da|Gorm den Gamle}}, {{lang-non|Gormr gamli}}, {{lang-la|Gormus Senex}}<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/gri_33125008656585|page=[https://archive.org/details/gri_33125008656585/page/n391 338]|quote=gormus senex.|title=De origine et usu obeliscorum|last=Zoega|first=Georg|date=1797-01-01|publisher=Typis Lazzarinii Typographi Cameralis|language=la}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zQX5Hd1YQtoC&pg=PA557&lpg=PA557&dq=%22gormus+senex%22#v=onepage&q=%22gormus%20senex%22&f=false|title=Thormodi Torf\u00e6i ...

The extent of Harald's Danish Kingdom is unknown, although it is reasonable to believe that it stretched from the defensive line of Dannevirke, including the Viking city of Hedeby, across Jutland, the Danish isles and into southern present day [[Sweden]]; [[Scania]] and perhaps [[Halland]] and [[Blekinge]]. Furthermore, the Jelling stones attest that Harald had also \"won\" [[Norway]].<ref name=\"Britannica Online Encyclopedia\">Staff.

By 1014, England had completely submitted to the Danes. However, distance and a lack of common interests prevented a lasting union, and Harald's son [[Cnut the Great]] barely maintained the link between the two countries, which completely broke up during the reign of his son [[Hardecanute]]. A final attempt by the Norwegians under [[Harald Hardrada]] to reconquer England failed, but did pave the way for William the Conqueror's takeover in 1066.<ref name=\"Britannica Online Encyclopedia\"/>\n\n=== Christianity, expansion and the establishment of the Kingdom of Denmark ===\n{{see also|North Sea Empire}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| image1 = Jelling gr Stein 1.JPG\n| width1 = 250\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Jelling gr Stein 3.JPG\n| width2 = 141\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Often regarded as Denmark's \"birth certificate\", the large [[Jelling stones|Jelling Stone]] announces the unification and Christianization of Denmark by [[Harald Bluetooth]] c. 980\n}}\n\nThe history of [[Christianity]] in Denmark overlaps with that of the Viking Age. Various petty kingdoms existed throughout the area now known as Denmark for many years. Between c. 960 and the early 980s, [[Harald Bluetooth]] appears to have established a kingdom in the lands of the Danes which stretched from Jutland to Sk\u00e5ne. Around the same time, he received a visit from a German [[missionary]] who, according to legend,<ref>Adam of Bremen, History of the Archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen, trans. Francis J. Tschan (New York, 2002), pp. 77\u201378.</ref> survived an [[trial by ordeal|ordeal by fire]], which convinced Harald to convert to [[Christianity]].\n\nThe new [[religion]], which replaced the old [[Norse mythology|Norse religious practices]], had many advantages for the king. Christianity brought with it some support from the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. It also allowed the king to dismiss many of his opponents who adhered to the old mythology. At this early stage there is no evidence that the Danish Church was able to create a stable administration that Harald could use to exercise more effective control over his kingdom, but it may have contributed to the development of a centralising political and religious ideology among the social elite which sustained and enhanced an increasingly powerful kingship.\n\n[[England]] broke away from Danish control in 1035 and Denmark fell into disarray for some time. Sweyn Estridsen's son, [[Canute IV of Denmark|Canute IV]], raided England for the last time in 1085. He planned another invasion to take the [[List of English monarchs|throne of England]] from an aging [[William I of England|William I]]. He called up a fleet of 1,000 Danish ships, 60 Norwegian [[Longship|long boats]], with plans to meet with another 600 ships under [[Robert I, Count of Flanders|Duke Robert of Flanders]] in the summer of 1086. Canute, however, was beginning to realise that the imposition of the tithe on Danish peasants and nobles to fund the expansion of monasteries and churches and a new [[Tax per head|head tax]] (Danish:nefgjald) had brought his people to the verge of rebellion. Canute took weeks to arrive where the fleet had assembled at Struer, but he found only the [[Norway|Norwegians]] still there.\n\nCanute thanked the Norwegians for their patience and then went from assembly to assembly (Danish:landsting) outlawing any sailor, captain or soldier who refused to pay a fine which amounted to more than a years harvest for most farmers. Canute and his [[Housecarl|housecarls]] fled south with a growing army of rebels on his heels. Canute fled to the royal property outside the town of Odense on Funen with his two brothers. After several attempts to break in and then bloody hand-to-hand fighting in the church, Benedict was cut down, and Canute was struck in the head by a large stone and then speared from the front. He died at the base of the main altar on 10 July 1086, where he was buried by the Benedictines. When Queen Edele came to take Canute's body to Flanders, a light allegedly shone around the church and it was taken as a sign that Canute should remain where he was.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole paragraph. The last sentence reads like a legend.|date=May 2012}}\n\nThe death of St. Canute marks the end of the Viking Age. Never again would massive flotillas of [[Scandinavia]]ns meet each year to ravage the rest of Christian Europe.\n\nCanute's nephew [[Sweyn II of Denmark|Sweyn Estridson]] (1020\u201374) re-established strong royal Danish authority and built a good relationship with [[Archbishop]] [[Adalbert of Hamburg]]-[[Archbishopric of Bremen|Bremen]] \u2014 at that time the Archbishop of all of [[Scandinavia]].\n\nIn the early 12th century, Denmark became the seat of an independent [[ecclesiastical province|church province]] of Scandinavia. Not long after that, [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]] established their own archbishoprics, free of Danish control. The mid-12th century proved a difficult time for the kingdom of Denmark. Violent [[civil war]]s rocked the land. Eventually, [[Valdemar I of Denmark|Valdemar the Great]] (1131\u201382), gained control of the kingdom, stabilizing it and reorganizing the administration. King Valdemar and [[Absalon]] (''ca'' 1128\u20131201), the [[Roskilde (titular see)|bishop of Roskilde]], rebuilt the country.\n\nDuring Valdemar's reign construction began of a castle in the village of Havn, leading eventually to the foundation of [[Copenhagen]], the modern capital of Denmark. Valdemar and Absalon built Denmark into a major power in the [[Baltic Sea]], a power which later competed with the [[Hanseatic League]], the counts of [[Holstein]], and the [[Teutonic Knights]] for trade, territory, and influence throughout the Baltic. In 1168, Valdemar and Absalon gained a foothold on the southern shore of the Baltic, when they subdued the [[Principality of R\u00fcgen]].\n\nIn the 1180s, [[Mecklenburg]] and the [[Duchy of Pomerania]] came under Danish control, too. In the new southern provinces, the Danes promoted Christianity (mission of the [[Rani (Slavic tribe)|Rani]], monasteries like [[Eldena Abbey]]) and settlement (Danish participation in the ''[[Ostsiedlung]]''). The Danes lost most of their southern gains after the [[Battle of Bornh\u00f6ved (1227)]], but the Rugian principality stayed with Denmark until 1325.\n\n{{Scandinavia map, 1219}}\n\nIn 1202, [[Valdemar II of Denmark|Valdemar II]] became king and launched various \"[[crusades]]\" to claim territories, notably modern [[Estonia]]. Once these efforts were successful, a period in history known as the [[Danish Estonia]] began. Legend has it that the Danish flag, the [[Flag of Denmark|Dannebrog]] fell from the sky during the [[Battle of Lyndanisse|Battle of Lindanise]] in Estonia in 1219. A series of Danish defeats culminating in the Battle of Bornh\u00f6ved on 22 July 1227 cemented the loss of Denmark's north German territories. Valdemar himself was saved only by the courageous actions of a German knight who carried Valdemar to safety on his horse.\n\nFrom that time on, Valdemar focused his efforts on domestic affairs. One of the changes he instituted was the feudal system where he gave properties to men with the understanding that they owed him service. This increased the power of the noble families ({{lang-da|h\u00f8jadelen}}) and gave rise to the lesser nobles ({{lang-da|lavadelen}}) who controlled most of Denmark. Free peasants lost the traditional rights and privileges they had enjoyed since Viking times.[3]\n\nThe king of Denmark had difficulty maintaining control of the kingdom in the face of opposition from the [[nobility]] and from the Church. An extended period of strained relations between the crown and the [[Pope]]s of [[Rome]] took place, known as the \"archiepiscopal conflicts\".\n\nBy the late 13th century, royal power had waned, and the nobility forced the king to grant a [[charter]], considered Denmark's first [[constitution]]. Following the [[Battle of Bornh\u00f6ved (1227)|Battle of Bornh\u00f6ved]] in 1227, a weakened Denmark provided windows of opportunity to both the Hanseatic League and the [[count of Holstein|Counts of Holstein]]. The Holstein Counts gained control of large portions of Denmark because the king would grant them fiefs in exchange for money to finance royal operations.\n\nValdemar spent the remainder of his life putting together a code of laws for [[Jutland]], [[Zealand]] and [[Sk\u00e5ne]]. These codes were used as Denmark's legal code until 1683. This was a significant change from the local law making at the regional assemblies ({{lang-da|landting}}), which had been the long-standing tradition. Several methods of determining guilt or innocence were outlawed including trial by ordeal and trial by combat. The [[Code of Jutland]] ({{lang-da|Jyske Lov}}) was approved at meeting of the nobility at Vordingborg in 1241 just prior to Valdemar's death. Because of his position as \"the king of Dannebrog\" and as a legislator, Valdemar enjoys a central position in Danish history. To posterity the civil wars and dissolution that followed his death made him appear to be the last king of a golden age.\n\nThe [[Middle Ages]] saw a period of close cooperation between the [[The Crown|Crown]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Thousands of church buildings sprang up throughout the country during this time. The economy expanded during the 12th century, based mostly on the lucrative [[herring]]-trade, but the 13th century turned into a period of difficulty and saw the temporary collapse of royal authority.\n\n=== Count rule ===\n[[File:Danmarks kongel\u00f8se tid.png|thumb|left|upright=1.1|The kingless time 1332\u20131340]]\nDuring the disastrous reign of [[Christopher II of Denmark|Christopher II]] (1319\u20131332), most of the country was seized by the provincial counts (except Sk\u00e5ne, which was taken over by Sweden) after numerous peasant revolts and conflicts with the Church. For eight years after Christopher's death, Denmark had no king, and was instead controlled by the counts. After one of them, [[Gerhard III of Holstein-Rendsburg]], was assassinated in 1340, Christopher's son [[Valdemar IV of Denmark|Valdemar]] was chosen as king, and gradually began to recover the territories, which was finally completed in 1360.\n\nThe [[Black Death]], which came to Denmark during these years, also aided Valdemar's campaign. His continued efforts to expand the kingdom after 1360 brought him into open conflict with the Hanseatic League. He conquered [[Gotland]], much to the displeasure of the League, which lost [[Visby]], an important trading town located there.\n\nThe Hanseatic alliance with Sweden to attack Denmark initially proved a fiasco since Danish forces captured a large Hanseatic fleet, and ransomed it back for an enormous sum. Luckily for the League, the Jutland nobles revolted against the heavy taxes levied to fight the expansionist war in the Baltic; the two forces worked against the king, forcing him into exile in 1370. For several years, the Hanseatic League controlled the fortresses on \"[[\u00d6resund|the sound]]\" between Sk\u00e5ne and Zealand.\n\n=== Margaret and the Kalmar Union (1397\u20131523)===\n{{main|Kalmar Union}}\n\n[[Margaret I of Denmark|Margaret I]], the daughter of Valdemar Atterdag, found herself married off to [[Haakon VI of Norway|H\u00e5kon VI of Norway]] in an attempt to join the two kingdoms, along with Sweden, since H\u00e5kon had kinship ties to the Swedish royal family. The dynastic plans called for her son, [[Olaf IV of Norway|Olaf II]] to rule the three kingdoms, but after his early death in 1387 she took on the role herself (1387\u20131412). During her lifetime (1353\u20131412) the three kingdoms of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden (including the [[Faroe Islands]], as well as [[Iceland]], [[Greenland]], and present-day [[Finland]]) became linked under her capable rule, in what became known as the [[Kalmar Union]], made official in 1397.\n[[File:Roskilde Margrethe1 grave.jpg|thumb|250px|The tomb of [[Margaret I of Denmark|Margaret I]] in [[Roskilde Cathedral]].]]\n\nHer successor, [[Eric VII of Denmark|Eric of Pomerania]] (King of Denmark from 1412 to 1439), lacked Margaret's skill and thus directly caused the breakup of the Kalmar Union. Eric's foreign policy engulfed Denmark in a succession of wars with the Holstein counts and the city of L\u00fcbeck. When the Hanseatic League imposed a trade embargo on Scandinavia, the Swedes (who saw their mining industry adversely affected) rose up in revolt. The three countries of the Kalmar Union all declared Eric deposed in 1439.\n\nHowever, support for the idea of regionalism continued, so when Eric's nephew [[Christopher of Bavaria]] came to the throne in 1440, he managed to get himself elected in all three kingdoms, briefly reuniting Scandinavia (1442\u20131448). The Swedish nobility grew increasingly unhappy with Danish rule and the union soon became merely a legal concept with little practical application. During the subsequent reigns of Christian I (1450\u20131481) and Hans (1481\u20131513), tensions grew, and several wars between Sweden and Denmark erupted.\n\nIn the early 16th century, [[Christian II of Denmark|Christian II]] (reigned 1513\u20131523) came to power. He allegedly declared, \"If the hat on my head knew what I was thinking, I would pull it off and throw it away.\" This quotation apparently refers to his devious and [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli|machiavellian]] political dealings. He conquered Sweden in an attempt to reinforce the union, and had about 100 leaders of the Swedish anti-unionist forces killed in what came to be known as the [[Stockholm Bloodbath]] of November 1520. The bloodbath destroyed any lingering hope of Scandinavian union.\n\nIn the aftermath of [[Sweden]]'s definitive secession from the [[Kalmar Union]] in 1521, [[civil war]] and the [[Protestant Reformation]] followed in Denmark and Norway. When things settled down, the [[Privy Council]] of Denmark had lost some of its influence, and that of Norway no longer existed. The two kingdoms, known as [[Denmark\u2013Norway]], operated in a personal union under a single monarch. Norway kept its separate laws and some institutions, such as a royal [[chancellor]], separate coinage and a separate army. As a hereditary kingdom, Norway's status as separate from Denmark remained important to the royal dynasty in its struggles to win elections as kings of Denmark. The two kingdoms remained tied until 1814.\n\n== Early Modern Denmark ==\n[[Image:Daniaeregnitypvs.jpg|thumb|right|250px| Abraham Ortelius's 1570 map of Denmark including parts on the Scandinavian peninsula.]]\n\n=== The Reformation ===\n{{main|Reformation in Denmark\u2013Norway and Holstein}}\n[[Image:Hans Tausen - Jacob Kornerup efter maleri i Ribe Domkirke.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Hans Tausen]] was one of the first Lutheran preachers, and later a bishop, in Denmark.]]\nThe [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], which originated in the German lands in the early 16th century from the ideas of [[Martin Luther]] (1483\u20131546), had a considerable impact on Denmark. The Danish Reformation started in the mid-1520s. Some Danes wanted access to the [[Bible]] in their own language. In 1524 Hans Mikkelsen and [[Christiern Pedersen]] translated the [[New Testament]] into Danish; it became an instant best-seller.<ref name=\"runeberg.org\"/>\n\nThose who had traveled to [[Wittenberg]] in Saxony and come under the influence of the teachings of [[Martin Luther|Luther]] and his associates included [[Hans Tausen]], a Danish monk in the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of St John Hospitallers]]. On Good Friday in 1525, Tausen used the pulpit at [[Antvorskov]] Abbey Church to proclaim Luther's reforms. His scandalized superiors ordered him out of Zealand and held him in the priory at [[Viborg, Denmark|Viborg]] under close confinement until he should come to his senses.<ref name=\"runeberg.org\">{{cite web\n|url= http://runeberg.org/dbl/17/\n|title= Tausen, Hans, 1494-1561, evangelisk Reformator og Biskop\n|accessdate= 2008-09-09\n|author= C.

Within days Tausen's ideas swept through the town. The then radical ideas of Luther found a receptive audience. Tausen's preaching converted ordinary people, merchants, nobles, and monks and even the Prior grew to appreciate Tausen and ordered his release. Tausen preached openly: much to the consternation of Bishop J\u00f8n Friis, who lost his ability to do anything about the Lutherans and retreated to Hald Castle.<ref name=\"runeberg.org\"/>\n\nAfter preaching in the open air, Tausen gained the use of a small chapel, which soon proved too small for the crowds who attended services in Danish. His followers broke open a Franciscan Abbey so they could listen to Tausen, who packed the church daily for services. The town leaders protected Tausen from the Bishop of Viborg.<ref name=\"runeberg.org\"/>\nViborg became the center for the Danish Reformation for a time. Lutheranism spread quickly to [[Aarhus]] and [[Aalborg]].\n\nWithin months King [[Frederick I of Denmark|Frederick]] appointed Tausen as one of his personal chaplains (October 1526) in order to protect him from Catholics. Tausen's version of Luther's ideas spread throughout Denmark. Copenhagen became a hotbed of reformist activity and Tausen moved there to continue his work. His reputation preceded him and the excitement of hearing the liturgy in Danish brought thousands of people out to hear him. With the kings' permission, churches in Copenhagen opened their doors to the Lutherans and held services for Catholics and for Lutherans at different times of the day.\n\nAt Our Lady Church, the main church of Copenhagen, Bishop Ronnow refused to admit the \"heretics\". In December 1531, a mob stormed the [[Church of Our Lady, Copenhagen|Church of Our Lady]] in Copenhagen, encouraged by Copenhagen's fiery mayor, [[Ambrosius Bogbinder]]. They tore down statues and side-altars and destroyed artwork and reliquaries. Frederick I's policy of toleration insisted that the two competing groups share churches and pulpits peacefully, but this satisfied neither Lutherans nor Catholics.\n\nLuther's ideas spread rapidly as a consequence of a powerful combination of popular enthusiasm for church reform and a royal eagerness to secure greater wealth through the seizure of church lands and property. In Denmark the reformation increased the crown's revenues by 300%.\n\n==== Dissatisfaction with the Catholic Church ====\nDissatisfaction with the established Catholic Church had already been widespread in Denmark. Many people viewed the [[tithe]]s and fees \u2014 a constant source of irritation for farmers and merchants \u2014 as unjust. This became apparent once word got out that King Frederick and his son, [[Christian III of Denmark|Duke Christian]] had no sympathy with Franciscans who persistently made the rounds of the parishes to collect food, money, and clothing in addition to the tithes. Between 1527 and 1536 many towns petitioned the king to close the Franciscan houses.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Kr\u00f8nike om Gr\u00e5brodrenes Udjagelse''\n</ref>\n\nFrederick obliged by sending letters authorizing the closure of the monasteries, often offering a small sum of money to help the brothers on their way. With the royal letter in hand, mobs forcibly closed [[Franciscan]] abbeys all over Denmark. They beat up monks, two of whom died.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The closure of Franciscan houses occurred systematically in Copenhagen, Viborg, Aalborg, Randers, Malm\u00f6 and ten other cities; in all, 28 monasteries or houses closed. People literally hounded Franciscan monks out of the towns.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nNo other order faced such harsh treatment. Considering how strongly many people felt about removing all traces of Catholic traditions from Danish churches, surprisingly little violence took place. Luther's teaching had become so overwhelmingly popular that Danes systematically cleared churches of statues, paintings, wall-hangings, reliquaries and other Catholic elements without interference. The only exceptions came in individual churches where the local churchmen refused to permit reform.\n\n[[Image:Christian III of Denmark.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Christian III of Denmark|King Christian III]] carried out the Protestant Reformation in Slesvig, Holsten, Denmark and Norway.]]\n[[Frederick I of Denmark|Frederick I]] died in 1533; the Viborg Assembly (Danish:landsting) [[Election of Christian III|proclaimed his son, Duke Christian of Schleswig, King Christian III]]. The State Council (Danish: Rigsr\u00e5d) on Zealand, led by the Catholic bishops, took control of the country and refused to recognize the election of Christian III, a staunch Lutheran. The regents feared Christian's zeal for Luther's ideas would tip the balance and disenfranchise Catholics \u2014 both peasants and nobles.\n\nThe State Council encouraged Count [[Christopher of Oldenburg]] to become Regent of Denmark. Christian III quickly raised an army to enforce his election, including mercenary troops from Germany. Count Christopher raised an army (including troops from [[Mecklenburg]] and [[Oldenburg]] and the Hanseatic League, especially [[L\u00fcbeck]]) to restore his Catholic uncle King [[Christian II]] (deposed in 1523). This resulted in a three-year civil war called the [[Count's Feud]] (Danish: ''Grevens Fejde'').\n\n==== Count's Feud (1534\u20131536) ====\nArmed rebellion by Catholic peasants led by [[Skipper Clement]] started in northern Jutland. Rebellion swept across [[Funen]], Zealand and Sk\u00e5ne. Christian III's army soundly defeated an army of Catholic nobles at Svenstrup on 16 October 1534. Christian forced a truce with the [[Hanseatic League]], which had sent troops to help Count Christopher. Christian III's army, under [[Johan Rantzau]], chased the rebels all the way back to [[Aalborg]] and then massacred over 2,000 of them inside the city in December 1534.\n\nThe Protestants captured Skipper Clement (1534), and later executed him in 1536. Christian III's mercenary troops put an end to Catholic hopes on Zealand and then Funen. Sk\u00e5ne rebels went as far as proclaiming Christian II king again. King [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav Vasa]] of Sweden sent two separate armies to ravage [[Halland]] and Sk\u00e5ne into submission. Besiegers finally starved the last hold-outs in the rebellion, Copenhagen and [[Malm\u00f8]], into surrender in July 1536. By the spring of 1536, Christian III had taken firm control.\n\n==== State Lutheranism ====\nDenmark became officially Lutheran on 30 October 1536 by decree of King Christian III, and in 1537 the reconstituted State Council approved the [[Church Order (Lutheran)|Lutheran Ordinances]] which was worked out by Danish theologians and [[Johannes Bugenhagen]], based on the [[Augsburg Confession]] and Luther's [[Small Catechism|Little Catechism]]. The government established the Danish National Church (Danish: ''Folkekirken'') as the [[state church]]. All of Denmark's Catholic bishops went to prison until such time as they converted to Luther's reform. The authorities released them when they promised to marry and to support the reforms.\n\nIf they agreed, they received property and spent the rest of their lives as wealthy landowners. If they refused conversion, they died in prison. The State confiscated Church lands to pay for the armies that had enforced Christian III's election. Priests swore allegiance to Lutheranism or found new employment. The new owners turned monks out of their monasteries and abbeys. Nuns in a few places gained permission to live out their lives in nunneries, though without governmental financial support. The Crown closed churches, abbeys, priories and cathedrals, giving their property to local nobles or selling it.\n\nThe King appointed Danish superintendents (later bishops) to oversee Lutheran orthodoxy in the church. Denmark became part of a Lutheran heartland extending through Scandinavia and northern Germany. The Catholic Church everywhere in Scandinavia had sealed its fate by supporting hopeless causes: Christian II and the emperor Charles V in Denmark, Norwegian independence in that country, and in Sweden the Kalmar Union. Geographical distance also prevented them from receiving anything more than a sympathetic ear from Rome.\n\nThe 17th century saw a period of strict Lutheran [[orthodoxy]] in Denmark, with harsh punishments visited on suspected followers of either [[John Calvin|Calvinism]] or [[Huldrych Zwingli]]. Lutheran authorities treated Catholics harshly \u2014 in the fear that they might undermine the king, government, and national church. In a delayed result of the Reformation, Denmark became embroiled in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) on the Protestant side.\n\n=== The loss of Eastern Denmark ===\n{{see also|Dominium maris baltici}}\n\nThe [[Denmark\u2013Norway|Dano-Norwegian Kingdom]] grew wealthy during the 16th century, largely because of the increased traffic through the [[\u00d8resund]], which Danes could tax because Denmark controlled both sides of the Sound. The trade in grain exports from [[Poland]] to the [[Netherlands]] and to the rest of Europe grew enormously at this time, and the Danish kings did not hesitate to cash in on it. The Sound duty was only repealed in the 1840s.\n\nThe Danish economy benefited from the [[Eighty Years' War]] (1568\u20131648) in the [[Netherlands]] because a large number of skilled refugees from that area (the most economically advanced in Europe) came to Denmark. This helped to modernize many aspects of society and to establish trading links between Denmark and the Netherlands.\n\n[[Denmark\u2013Norway]] had a reputation as a relatively powerful kingdom at this time. European politics of the 16th century revolved largely around the struggle between Catholic and Protestant forces, so it seemed almost inevitable that Denmark, a strong, unified Lutheran kingdom, would get drawn into the larger war when it came. The [[Thirty Years' War]] went badly for the Protestant states in the early 1620s, and a call went out to [[Denmark\u2013Norway]] to \"save the Protestant cause\".\n\nKing [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]], who was also a duke of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] on the basis of his possessions in [[Duchy of Holstein|Holstein]], decided to intervene in the conflict raging in northern Germany. The campaign [[Battle of Wolgast|ended in defeat]], and Jutland was occupied by the imperial army of [[Albrecht von Wallenstein]]. In the [[Treaty of L\u00fcbeck]], Christian made peace and agreed to not intervene in Germany again. The war in Germany had been very expensive and [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] saw no other recourse than to raise the Sound tolls. Unfortunately, this act pushed the [[Netherlands]] away from Denmark and into the arms of Sweden.\n\n==== Torstenson War (1643\u20131645)====\n[[File:Danmark f\u00f8r 1645.png|thumb|Denmark before 1645]]\nIn 1643, Sweden's armies, under the command of [[Lennart Torstensson]], suddenly invaded Denmark without declaring war. The ensuing conflict became known as the [[Torstenson War]]. The [[Netherlands]], wishing to end the Danish stranglehold on the Baltic, joined the Swedes in their war against [[Denmark\u2013Norway]]. In October 1644, a combined Dutch-Swedish fleet destroyed 80 percent of the Danish fleet in the Battle of Femern. The result of this defeat proved disastrous for [[Denmark\u2013Norway]]: in the [[Second treaty of Br\u00f6msebro (1645)]] Denmark ceded to Sweden the Norwegian provinces [[Jemtland]], [[Herjedalen]] and [[\u00c4lvdalen Municipality|\u00c4lvdalen]] as well as the Danish islands of [[Gotland]] and [[Saaremaa|\u00d8sel]]. [[Halland]] went to Sweden for a period of 30 years and the [[Netherlands]] were exempted from paying the Sound Duty.\n\n[[File:Danmark f\u00f8r 1658.png|thumb|Denmark before 1658]]\n[[File:Scandinavia 1658.gif|thumb|right|'''Treaty of Roskilde, 1658'''.<br />{{legend|#FF0000|Halland, previously occupied by Sweden for a 30-year period under the terms of the Peace of Br\u00f6msebro negotiated in 1645, was now ceded}}\n{{legend|#FFFF00|the Scanian lands and Bohus County were ceded}}\n{{legend|#B404AE|Tr\u00f8ndelag and Bornholm provinces, which were ceded in 1658, but rebelled against Sweden and returned to Danish rule in [[Treaty of Copenhagen (1660)|1660]].}}]]\n\nNevertheless, Danes remember Christian IV as one of the great kings of Denmark. He had a very long reign, from 1588 to 1648, and has become known as \"the architect on the Danish throne\" because of the large number of building [[project]]s he undertook. Many of the great buildings of Denmark date from his reign. After the death of Christian IV in 1648, his son Frederick succeeded him.\n\n==== Second Northern War (1655\u20131660) ====\nIn 1657, during the [[Second Northern War]], [[Denmark\u2013Norway]] launched a war of revenge against Sweden (then distracted in Poland) which turned into a complete disaster. The war became a disaster for two reasons: Primarily, because Denmark's new powerful ally, the [[Netherlands]], remained neutral as Denmark was the aggressor and Sweden the defender. Secondly, the [[Great Belt|Belts]] froze over in a rare occurrence during the winter of 1657\u20131658, allowing [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden]] to [[March across the Belts|lead his armies across the ice]] to invade [[Zealand]].\n\nIn the following [[Treaty of Roskilde]], [[Denmark\u2013Norway]] capitulated and gave up all of [[Terra Scania|Eastern Denmark]] (Danish: Sk\u00e5ne, Halland, Blekinge and [[Bornholm]]), in addition to the counties of [[Bahusia]] (Norwegian: B\u00e5huslen) and [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]] in Norway. [[Holstein-Gottorp]] was also tied to Sweden, providing a gateway for future invasions from the south.\n\nBut the Second Northern War was not yet over. Three months after the peace treaty was signed, [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden]] held a council of war where he decided to simply wipe Denmark from the map and unite all of Scandinavia under his rule. Once again the Swedish army arrived outside Copenhagen. However, this time the Danes did not panic or surrender. Instead, they decided to fight and prepared to defend Copenhagen.\n\n[[File:T\u00e5get \u00f6ver b\u00e4lt2.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[March across the Belts]] in 1658]]\n[[Frederick III of Denmark]] had stayed in his capital and now encouraged the citizens of Copenhagen to resist the Swedes, by saying he would die in his nest. Furthermore, this unprovoked declaration of war by Sweden finally triggered the alliance that [[Denmark\u2013Norway]] had with the [[Netherlands]]. A powerful Dutch fleet was sent to Copenhagen with vital supplies and reinforcements, which saved the city from being captured during the [[Assault on Copenhagen|Swedish attack]]. Furthermore, [[Brandenburg-Prussia]], the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and the [[Habsburg monarchy]] had gathered large forces to aid [[Denmark\u2013Norway]] and fighting continued into 1659. \n[[File:Battle in k\u00f8ge bay-claus moinichen 1686.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Battle of K\u00f8ge Bay (1677)|Battle of K\u00f8ge Bay]] in 1677]]\n\n[[Charles X Gustav of Sweden]] suddenly died of an illness in early 1660, while planning an invasion of Norway. Following his death, Sweden made peace in the [[Treaty of Copenhagen (1660)|Treaty of Copenhagen]]. The Swedes returned [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]] to Norway and [[Bornholm]] to Denmark, but kept both [[Bahusia]] and [[Terra Scania]]. The [[Netherlands]] and other European powers accepted the settlement, not wanting both coasts of the Sound controlled by Denmark. This treaty established the boundaries between Norway, Denmark, and Sweden that still exist today. All in all, Sweden had now surpassed Denmark as the most powerful country in Scandinavia.\n\n=== Absolutism ===\n\nAs a result of the disaster in the war against Sweden, [[Frederick III of Denmark|King Frederick III]] (reigned 1648\u20131670) succeeded in convincing the nobles to give up some of their powers and their exemption from taxes, leading to the era of [[political absolutism|absolutism]] in Denmark. The country's main objective in the following decades was the recovery of its lost provinces from Sweden. In the 1670s, [[Denmark\u2013Norway]] had regained enough strength to start [[Scanian War|a war with Sweden to recover its lost provinces]]. However, in spite of Denmark's outside support, naval dominance and initial support from the population of [[Terra Scania|the former eastern provinces]], the war ended in a bitter [[Peace of Lund|stalemate]].\n\n==== Great Northern War (1700\u20131721) ====\nA renewed attack during the [[Great Northern War|Third Northern War]] (1700\u20131721) first resulted in the unfavourable [[Peace of Travendal]], but after Denmark's re-entry into the war and Sweden's ultimate defeat by a large alliance, Sweden was no longer a threat to Denmark. However, the great powers opposed any Danish territorial gains, which meant the [[Treaty of Frederiksborg]] did not return the former eastern provinces to Denmark. Furthermore, Denmark was even forced to return [[Swedish Pomerania]], [[Siege of Stralsund (1711\u20131715)|held by Danish forces since 1715]], to Sweden. Denmark now had no hope of recovering its lost provinces from Sweden. As noted earlier, the rest of Europe was simply against the Sound being controlled by a single nation ever again.\n\nFor most of the 18th century, Denmark was at peace. The only time when war threatened was in 1762, when the [[Duke of Holstein-Gottorp]] became Tsar [[Peter III of Russia]] and declared war on Denmark over his ancestral claims in [[Schleswig]]. Before any fighting could begin, however, he was overthrown by his wife, who took control of Russia as Tsarina [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] (Catherine the Great).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Elements of General History, Ancient and Modern|first=Lord Alexander Fraser|last=Tytler Woodhouselee|authorlink=Alexander Fraser Tytler, Lord Woodhouselee|pages=[https://archive.org/details/elementsofgenera02wood/page/428 428]\u2013429|year=1823|publisher=H. Hill|url=https://archive.org/details/elementsofgenera02wood|accessdate=4 November 2016}}</ref> Empress Catherine withdrew her husband's demands and negotiated the transfer of ducal [[Schleswig-Holstein]] to the Danish crown in return for Russian control of the [[County of Oldenburg]] and adjacent lands within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], an exchange that was formalized with the 1773 [[Treaty of Tsarskoye Selo]]. The alliance that accompanied the territorial exchange tied Denmark's foreign policy to Russia's and led directly to Denmark's involvement in a series of wars over the succeeding decades.\n\nWith the suspension of the Danish [[diet (assembly)|diet]], that body disappeared for a couple of centuries. During this time power became increasingly centralized in Copenhagen. Frederick's government reorganized itself in a much more hierarchical manner, built around the king as a focal point of administration. Crown officials dominated the administration, as well as a new group of bureaucrats, much to the dismay of the traditional aristocracy, who saw their own influence curtailed even further. The absolutist kings of Denmark were quite weak compared to their Swedish counterparts, and non-noble landlords became the real rulers of the country. They used their influence to pass laws that favored themselves.\n\nThe administration and laws underwent \"modernization\" during this period. In 1683, the ''Danske lov 1683'' ([[Danish Code]]) standardized and collected all the old provincial laws. Other initiatives included the standardization of all [[weights and measures]] throughout the kingdom, and an agricultural survey and registry. This survey allowed the government to begin taxing landowners directly, moving it beyond dependence on revenue from [[crown land]]s.\n\nThe population of Denmark rose steadily through this period, from 600,000 in 1660 (after the loss of territory to Sweden) to 700,000 in 1720. By 1807, it had risen to 978,000.\n\n==== Changes in the agricultural economy ====\nAttempts to diversify the economy away from agriculture failed. During this period, little industry existed, except for a very small amount in Copenhagen (population: 30,000). In the late 17th century a small amount of industry did develop, catering to the military. Denmark suffered in part because of its lack of natural resources. It had nothing much to export except agricultural products. The Netherlands bought the largest share of Denmark's exports. The landlords, only about 300 in number, nevertheless owned 90% of the land in the country.\n\nRural administration remained primarily the preserve of the large landholders and of a few law-enforcement officials. In 1733, low crop prices caused the introduction of [[adscription]], an effort by the landlords to obtain cheap labor. The effect of this was to turn the previously free Danish peasantry into serfs. The adscription system tied rural laborers to their place of birth and required them to rent farms on the estates.\n\nAs rent, peasants were required to work the landlords' plots and could not negotiate contracts or demand payment for improvements made to the farm. Peasants who refused to rent a farm were subject to six years of military service. Danish agriculture was very inefficient and unproductive as a result, since the peasants had no motivation to perform anything more than the absolute minimum of work. Attempts to sell Danish grain in Norway failed because of its low quality compared to grain from the Baltic.\n\nIn the late 18th century, extensive agricultural reforms took place, involving the abolition of the old [[Open field system|open-field system]] and the amalgamation of many smaller farms into larger ones. With the abolition of the adscription system, the military could now only obtain manpower through conscription. These reforms were possible because agricultural prices steadily rose in the second half of the century.\n\nThroughout the 18th century, the Danish economy did very well, largely on the basis of expanded agricultural output to meet growing demand across Europe. Danish merchant ships also traded around Europe and the North Atlantic, venturing to new [[Danish colonization of the Americas|Danish colonies]] in the Caribbean and North Atlantic.\n\n==== The Enlightenment and Danish nationalism ====\n[[Image:Forrige Grev Iohan Frid. Struensee og Grev Enevold Brandt forreffillet og afbildet po hiul og Steyler d. 28 Aprill 1772.jpg|thumb|180px|Denmark's social reformers [[Johann Friedrich Struensee|Struensee]] and [[Enevold Brandt|Brandt]] quartered and displayed on the wheel on 28 April 1772]]\nNew propriety and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas became popular among the [[middle class]]es of Denmark, arousing increased interest in [[personal liberty]]. In the last 15 years of the 18th century, the authorities relaxed the censorship which had existed since the beginning of the 17th century. At the same time, a sense of Danish nationalism began to develop. Hostility increased against Germans and Norwegians present at the royal court. Pride in the Danish language and culture increased, and eventually a law banned \"foreigners\" from holding posts in the government. Antagonism between Germans and Danes increased from the mid-18th century on.\n\nIn the 1770s, during the reign of the mentally unstable Christian VII (1766\u20131808), the queen's lover, a German doctor named [[Johann Friedrich Struensee]], became the real ruler of the country. Filled with the ideas of the Enlightenment, he attempted a number of radical reforms including freedom of the press and religion. But it was short-lived. The landlords feared that the reforms were a threat to their power, while the commoners believed that religious freedom was an invitation to atheism.\n\nIn 1772, Struensee was arrested, tried, and convicted of crimes against the majesty, his right hand was cut off following his beheading, his remains were quartered and put on display on top of spikes on the commons west of Copenhagen. The next 12 years were a period of unmitigated reaction until a group of reformers gained power in 1784.\n\n=====Reforms=====\nDenmark became the model of enlightened despotism, partially influenced by the ideas of the French Revolution. Denmark thus adopted liberalizing reforms in line with those of the French Revolution, with no direct contact. Danes were aware of French ideas and agreed with them, as it moved from Danish absolutism to a liberal constitutional system between 1750\u20131850. The change of government in 1784 was caused by a power vacuum created when King Christian VII took ill, and influence shifted to the crown prince (who later became King Frederick VI) and reform-oriented landowners. Between 1784 and 1815, the abolition of [[serfdom]] made the majority of the peasants into landowners. The government also introduced [[free trade]] and [[universal education]]. In contrast to France under the '''ancien regime''', agricultural reform was intensified in Denmark, civil rights were extended to the peasants, the finances of the Danish state were healthy, and there were no external or internal crises. That is, reform was gradual and the regime itself carried out agrarian reforms that had the effect of weakening absolutism by creating a class of independent peasant freeholders. Much of the initiative came from well-organized liberals who directed political change in the first half of the 19th century.<ref>Henrik Horstboll, and Uffe Osterg\u00e5rd, \"Reform and Revolution: The French Revolution and the Case of Denmark, ''Scandinavian Journal of History'' (1990) 15#3 pp 155-179</ref>\n\n=====Newspapers=====\nDanish news media first appeared in the 1540s, when handwritten fly sheets reported on the news. In 1666, [[Anders Bording]], the father of Danish journalism, began a state paper. The royal privilege to bring out a newspaper was issued to Joachim Wielandt in 1720. University officials handled the censorship, but in 1770 Denmark became one of the first nations of the world to provide for press freedom; it ended in 1799. In 1795\u20131814, the press, led by intellectuals and civil servants, called out for a more just and modern society, and spoke out for the oppressed tenant farmers against the power of the old aristocracy.<ref>Thorkild Kj\u00e6rgaard, \"The rise of press and public opinion in eighteenth\u2010century Denmark\u2014Norway.\" ''Scandinavian journal of History'' 14.4 (1989): 215-230. He stresses the role</ref>\n\nIn 1834, the first liberal newspaper appeared, one that gave much more emphasis to actual news content rather than opinions. The newspapers championed the Revolution of 1848 in Denmark. The new constitution of 1849 liberated the Danish press. Newspapers flourished in the second half of the 19th century, usually tied to one or another political party or labor union. Modernization, bringing in new features and mechanical techniques, appeared after 1900. The total circulation was 500,000 daily in 1901, more than doubling to 1.2 million in 1925. The German occupation brought informal censorship; some offending newspaper buildings were simply blown up by the Nazis. During the war, the underground produced 550 newspapers\u2014small, surreptitiously printed sheets that encouraged sabotage and resistance.<ref>Kenneth E.

Denmark also controlled traditional colonies{{citation needed|reason=Greenland and Iceland where part of the Kingdom and did not have colonial status.|date=October 2016}} in Greenland and Iceland in the north Atlantic, obtained through the union with Norway. [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] (reigned 1588\u20131648) first initiated the policy of expanding Denmark's overseas trade, as part of the [[mercantilist]] trend then popular in European governing circles. Denmark established its own first colony at [[Tranquebar]], or Trankebar, on India's south coast, in 1620.\n\nIn the [[Caribbean]] Denmark started a colony on [[Saint Thomas, United States Virgin Islands|St Thomas]] in 1671, [[Saint John, United States Virgin Islands|St John]] in 1718, and purchased [[Saint Croix]] from [[France]] in 1733. Denmark maintained its Indian colony, Tranquebar, as well as several other smaller colonies there, for about two hundred years. The [[Danish East India Company]] operated out of Tranquebar.\n\nDuring its heyday, the Danish East Indian Company and the [[Swedish East India Company]] imported more tea than the [[British East India Company]] \u2014 and smuggled 90% of it into Britain, where it sold at a huge profit. Both of the Scandinavia-based East India Companies folded during the course of the Napoleonic Wars. Denmark also maintained other colonies, forts, and bases in West Africa, primarily for the purpose of [[Slavery|slave]]-trading.\n\n== 19th century ==\n{{anchor|The 19th century}}\n{{see|Danish Golden Age}}\n\n=== The Napoleonic Wars ===\n\n[[Image:Slaget p\u00e5 reden.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The Battle of Copenhagen, 1801.]]\n\nThe long decades of peace came to an abrupt end during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Britain felt threatened by the Armed Neutrality Treaty of 1794, which originally involved Denmark and Sweden, and later Prussia and Russia. The [[Royal Navy|British fleet]] [[Battle of Copenhagen (1801)|attacked Copenhagen]] in 1801, destroying much of Denmark's navy. Denmark nonetheless managed to remain largely uninvolved in the Napoleonic Wars until 1807. The British [[Naval fleet|fleet]] [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|bombarded Copenhagen]] again that year, causing considerable destruction to the city. They then captured the entire Danish fleet so that it could not be used by France to invade Britain (as the French had lost their own fleet at Trafalgar in 1805), leading to the [[Gunboat War]] (1807\u20131814). The confiscation of the Danish navy was widely criticised in Britain.\n\nIn 1809 Danish forces fighting on the French side participated in defeating the anti-Bonapartist German rebellion led by [[Ferdinand von Schill]], at the [[Battle of Stralsund (1809)|Battle of Stralsund]]. By 1813, Denmark could no longer bear the war costs, and the [[National bankruptcy|state was bankrupt]]. When in the same year the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|Sixth Coalition]] isolated Denmark by clearing Northern Germany of French forces, [[Frederick VI of Denmark|Frederick VI]] had to make peace. Accordingly, the unfavourable [[Treaty of Kiel]] was concluded in January 1814 with Sweden and Great Britain, and another peace was signed with Russia in February.\n\nThe post-Napoleonic [[Congress of Vienna]] demanded the dissolution of the Dano-Norwegian union, and this was confirmed by the [[Treaty of Kiel]] in 1814. The treaty transferred [[Heligoland]] to Great Britain and [[Norway]] from the Danish to the Swedish crown, Denmark was to be satisfied with [[Swedish Pomerania]]. But the [[Norway in 1814|Norwegians revolted]], declared their independence, and elected crown-prince Christian Frederick (the future [[Christian VIII of Denmark|Christian VIII]]) as their king. However, the Norwegian independence movement failed to attract any support from the European powers. After a brief war with Sweden, Christian had to abdicate in order to preserve Norwegian autonomy, established in a [[personal union]] with Sweden. In favour of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], Denmark renounced her claims to Swedish Pomerania at the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1815), and instead was satisfied with the [[Duchy of Lauenburg]] and a Prussian payment of 3.5 million talers. Prussia also took over a Danish 600,000-taler debt to Sweden.\n\nThis period also counts as \"the Golden Age\" of Danish [[intellectual history]]. A sign of renewed intellectual vigor was the introduction of compulsory schooling in 1814. Literature, painting, sculpture, and philosophy all experienced an unusually vibrant period. The stories of [[Hans Christian Andersen]] (1805\u20131875) became popular not only in Denmark, but all over Europe and in the United States.<ref>{{cite book |title=Hans Christian Andersen: Danish Writer and Citizen of the World | editor=Sven Hakon Rossel |year=1996 |publisher=Rodopi |isbn= |pages=52\u201354 }}</ref> The ideas of the philosopher [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]] (1813\u20131855) spread far beyond Denmark, influencing not only his own era, but proving instrumental in the development of new philosophical systems after him. The sculptures of [[Bertel Thorvaldsen|Thorvaldsen]] (1770\u20131834) grace public buildings all over Denmark and other artists appreciated and copied his style. [[N. F. S. Grundtvig|Grundtvig]] (1783\u20131872) tried to reinvigorate the Danish National Church and contributed to the hymns used by the church in Denmark.\n\n=== Nationalism and liberalism ===\n{{see also|History of Schleswig-Holstein}}\n[[File:Grundlovgivende rigsforsamling - Constantin Hansen.jpg|thumb|''Den Grundlovgivende Rigsforsamling''<br /> The Constitutional Assembly created The [[Constitution of Denmark|Danish constitution]], 1860\u20131864 painting by [[Constantin Hansen]].]]\nThe Danish [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[nationalism|national]] movements gained momentum in the 1830s, and after the European revolutions of 1848 Denmark became a [[constitutional monarchy]] on 5 June 1849. The growing [[bourgeoisie]] had demanded a share in government, and in an attempt to avert the sort of bloody revolution occurring elsewhere in Europe, [[Frederick VII of Denmark|Frederick VII]] gave in to the demands of the citizens. A new constitution emerged, [[Separation of powers|separating the powers]] and granting the [[suffrage|franchise]] to all adult males, as well as freedom of the press, religion, and association. The king became head of the [[executive branch]]. The [[legislative branch]] consisted of two parliamentary chambers; the [[Folketing]], comprising members elected by the general population, and the [[Landsting (Denmark)|Landsting]], elected by landowners. Denmark also gained an independent [[judiciary]].\n\nAnother significant result of the revolution was the [[abolitionism|abolition of slavery]] in the [[Danish West Indies]], the Danish colony in the Caribbean, which at an earlier part of its history witnessed the biggest slave auctions in the world.<ref>Neville A.T. Hall, and B. W. Higman, ''Slave Society in the Danish West Indies: St. Thomas, St. John, and St. Croix'' (Aarhus Universitetsforlag, 1992).</ref> In 1845 Denmark's other tropical colony, [[Tranquebar]] in India, was sold to Britain.\n\nThe Danish king's realm still consisted of the islands, the northern half of the [[Jutland]] peninsula, and the [[Duchy of Schleswig]] in [[real union]] with the [[Duchy of Holstein]].\n\n[[File:F\u00f8rste Infanteriregiment i Haandgem\u00e6ng med Regimentet Martini.png|thumb|left|Danish Infantry regiment in a fight with regiment \"Martini\". Contemporary illustration of the 1864 [[Second Schleswig War]].]]\nThe islands and Jutland together constituted the kingdom, whereas the monarch held the duchies in [[personal union]] with the kingdom. The duchy of Schleswig constituted a Danish [[fief]], while the Duchy of Holstein remained a part of the [[German Confederation]].\n\nSince the early 18th century, and even more so from the early 19th century, the Danes had become used to viewing the duchies and the kingdom as increasingly unified in one [[Sovereign state|state]]. This view, however, clashed with that of the German majority in the duchies, also enthused by liberal and national trends, which led to a movement known as Schleswig-Holsteinism. Schleswig-Holsteinists aimed for independence from Denmark. The [[First Schleswig War]] (1848\u20131851) broke out after constitutional change in 1849 and ended with the ''status quo'' because of the intervention of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and other Great Powers.\n\nMuch debate took place in Denmark as to how to deal with the question of Schleswig-Holstein. National-Liberals demanded permanent ties between Schleswig and Denmark, but stated that Holstein could do as it pleased. However, international events overtook domestic Danish politics, and Denmark faced war against both [[Prussia]] and [[Austria]] in what became known as the [[Second Schleswig War]] (1864). The war lasted from February to October 1864. Denmark was easily beaten by Prussia and Austria, and obliged to relinquish both Schleswig and Holstein.\n\nThe war caused Denmark as a nation severe trauma, forcing it to reconsider its place in the world. The loss of Schleswig-Holstein came as the latest in the long series of defeats and territorial loss that had begun in the 17th century. The Danish state had now lost some of the richest areas of the kingdom: Sk\u00e5ne to Sweden and Schleswig to Germany, so the nation focused on developing the poorer areas of the country. Extensive agricultural improvements took place in Jutland, and a new form of nationalism, which emphasized the \"small\" people, the decency of rural Denmark, and the shunning of wider aspirations, developed.\n\n=== Industrialisation ===\n[[Industrialisation]] came to Denmark in the second half of the 19th century. The nation's first railroads were constructed in the 1850s, and improved communications and overseas trade allowed industry to develop in spite of Denmark's lack of natural resources. Trade unions developed starting in the 1870s. There was a considerable migration of people from the countryside to the cities, and Danish agriculture became centered around the export of dairy and meat products.\n\nThe two concepts of internationalism and nationalism have become very much part of the history of the Danish [[Labour movement]].\n\nThe Labour movement gathered momentum when social issues became associated with internationalism. Socialist theory and organisational contact with the [[International Workingmen's Association|First International]], which linked labour movements in various countries, paved the way. [[Louis Pio]] emerged as the driving force. In 1871, following the bloody defeat of the [[Paris Commune]], he started publishing socialist journalism. He campaigned strongly for an independent organisation of the workers under their own management, and organised a Danish branch of the First International. This became the foundation stone for the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democratic Party]] under the name of ''Den Internationale Arbejderforening for Danmark'' (The International Labour Association for Denmark). As a combination of union and political party, it adroitly brought together national and international elements.\n\nPio saw internationalism as vital for the success of the workers' struggle: without internationalism, no progress. He pointed out that the middle classes cooperated across national frontiers and used nationalistic rhetoric as a weapon against the workers and their liberation.\n\nThe Danish section started organising strikes and demonstrations for higher wages and social reforms. Demands were moderate, but enough to provoke the employers and the forces of [[Law and order (politics)|law and order]]. Things came to a head in the Battle of [[F\u00e6lledparken|F\u00e6lleden]] on 5 May 1872. The authorities arrested the three leaders, Louis Pio, [[Poul Geleff]] and Harald Brix, charged them and convicted them of high treason. The three left Denmark for the United States to set up the ill-starred and short-lived socialist colony near Hays City, in [[Ellis County, Kansas]].\n\nBack in Denmark, the emerging political situation made possible by the new Danish door of independence alarmed many of the existing elites, since it inevitably [[empowerment|empowered]] the peasantry. Simple men with little education replaced professors and professionals in positions of power. The peasants, in coalition with liberal and radical elements from the cities, eventually won a majority of seats in the Folketing. Even though constitutional changes had taken place to boost the power of the Landsting, the Left ''[[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]]'' Party demanded to form the government, but the king, still the head of the executive branch, refused. However, in 1901, king [[Christian IX of Denmark|Christian IX]] gave in and asked [[Johan Henrik Deuntzer]], a member of Venstre, to form a government, the [[Cabinet of Deuntzer]]. This began a tradition of [[parliamentary government]], and with the exception of the [[Easter Crisis of 1920]], no government since 1901 has ruled against a parliamentary majority in the Folketing.\n\n=== Monetary union ===\n{{main|Scandinavian Monetary Union}}\n[[File:Two 20kr gold coins.png|thumb|right|Two golden 20 kr coins from the Scandinavian Monetary Union, which was based on a [[gold standard]]. The coin to the left is Swedish and the right one is Danish.]]\n\nThe [[Scandinavian Monetary Union]], a [[monetary union]] formed by Sweden and Denmark on 5 May 1873, fixed both their [[currency|currencies]] against [[gold standard|gold]] [[Par value|at par]] to each other. [[Norway]], governed in union with Sweden, entered the monetary union two years later in 1875 by pegging its currency to gold at the same level as Denmark and Sweden (.403&nbsp;gram).<ref>[http://www.nationalbanken.dk/dnuk/hist.nsf/side/From_silver_standard_to_gold_standard From silver standard to gold standard] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103214722/http://www.nationalbanken.dk/dnuk/hist.nsf/side/From_silver_standard_to_gold_standard |date=2013-11-03 }}, retrieved 2008-08-05</ref> The monetary union proved one of the few tangible results of the [[Scandinavist]] political movement of the 19th century.\n\nThe union provided fixed exchange-rates and stability in monetary terms, but the member-countries continued to issue their own separate currencies. In an outcome not initially foreseen, the perceived security led to a situation where the formally separate currencies circulated on a basis of \"as good as\" the [[legal tender]] virtually throughout the entire area.\n\nThe outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914 brought an end to the monetary union. Sweden abandoned the tie to gold on 2 August 1914, and without a fixed exchange rate the free circulation came to an end.\n\n== 20th century ==\n\n=== 1901\u20131939 ===\nIn the early decades of the 20th century the new [[Det Radikale Venstre|Radical Party]] and the older [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre Party]] shared government. During this time women gained the [[Women's suffrage|right to vote]] (1915), and the United States purchased some of Denmark's colonial holdings: the three islands of [[Saint John, United States Virgin Islands|St. John]], [[St. Croix]], and [[Saint Thomas, United States Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]] in the [[West Indies]]. The period also saw Denmark inaugurating important social and labour-market reforms, laying the basis for the {{As of|2008|alt=present}} [[welfare state]].\n\nDenmark remained [[Neutral country|neutral]] during [[World War I]], but the conflict affected the country to a considerable extent. As its economy was heavily based on exports, the unrestricted German submarine warfare was a serious problem. Denmark had no choice but to sell many of its exports to Germany instead of overseas nations. Widespread [[war profiteer|profiteering]] took place, but commerce also suffered great disruption because of the conflict and because of the ensuing financial instability in Europe. Rationing was instituted, and there were food and fuel shortages. In addition, Denmark was forced by Berlin to mine the Sound to prevent British ships from entering it. Following the defeat of Germany in the war (1918), the [[Treaty of Versailles]] (1919) mandated the [[Schleswig Plebiscites]], which resulted in the return of [[Northern Schleswig]] ({{As of|2008|alt=now}} [[Southern Jutland|South Jutland]]) to Denmark. The king and parts of the opposition grumbled that Prime Minister [[Carl Theodor Zahle]] (in office 1909\u20131910 and 1913\u20131920) did not use Germany's defeat to take back a bigger portion of the province, which Denmark had lost in the [[Second Schleswig War]] in 1864. The king and the opposition wanted to take over the city of [[Flensburg]], while the cabinet insisted on only claiming areas where a majority of Danes lived, which led to a plebiscite in the affected areas over whether they wanted to become a part of [[Denmark]] or remain within [[Germany]]. Believing that he had the support of the people, King Christian X used his [[reserve power]] to dismiss Zahle's cabinet, sparking the [[Easter Crisis of 1920]]. As a result of the Easter Crisis, the king promised to no longer interfere in politics. Although the [[Danish Constitution]] was not amended at that time, Danish monarchs have stayed out of politics since then. The end of the war also prompted the Danish government to finish negotiating with [[Iceland]], resulting in Iceland becoming a sovereign [[Kingdom of Iceland|Kingdom]] on 1 December 1918 while retaining the Danish monarch as [[head of state]].\n\nIn the [[1924 Danish Folketing election|1924 Folketing election]] the [[Social Democrat]]s, under the charismatic [[Thorvald Stauning]], became Denmark's largest parliamentary political party, a position they maintained until 2001. Since the opposition still held a majority of the seats in the [[Landsting (Denmark)|Landsting]], Stauning had to co-operate with some of the right-wing parties, making the Social Democrats a more mainstream party. He succeeded in brokering an important deal in the 1930s which brought an end to the [[Great Depression]] in Denmark, and also laid the foundation for a welfare state.\n\nDenmark joined the [[League of Nations]] in 1920 and during the interwar period was active in promoting peaceful solutions to international issues. With the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]] in Germany during the 1930s, the country found itself in a very precarious situation. Berlin refused to recognize its post-1920 border with Denmark, however the Nazi regime was preoccupied with more important matters and did not make any issue of it. The Danes tried unsuccessfully to obtain recognition of the border from their neighbor, but otherwise went out of their way to avoid antagonizing Germany.\n\n=== Second World War ===\n{{main|Occupation of Denmark}}\n[[Image:Christian X.jpg|left|thumb|During the German occupation, King Christian X became a powerful symbol of national sovereignty. This image dates from the King's birthday, 26 September 1940. Note the lack of a guard.]]\n\nIn 1939, Hitler offered nonaggression pacts to the Scandinavian nations. While Sweden and Norway refused, Denmark readily accepted. When WWII began that fall, Copenhagen declared its neutrality. Nevertheless, Germany (so as to secure communications for its invasion of Norway) occupied Denmark on April 9, 1940, meeting limited resistance. British forces, however, [[British occupation of the Faroe Islands in World War II|occupied]] the [[Faroe Islands]] (12 April 1940) and [[Invasion of Iceland|invaded]] [[Iceland]] (10 May 1940) in pre-emptive moves to prevent German occupation. Following a [[1944 Icelandic referendum|plebiscite]], Iceland declared its independence on June 17, 1944 and became a republic, dissolving its union with Denmark.\n\nThe Nazi occupation of Denmark unfolded in a unique manner. The Monarchy remained. The conditions of occupation started off very leniently (although the authorities banned [[Communist Party of Denmark|Danmarks Kommunistiske Parti]] (the Communist party) when the Wehrmacht [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]] in June 1941), and Denmark retained its own government. The new coalition government tried to protect the population from Nazi rule through compromise. The Germans allowed the Folketing to remain in session. Despite [[Deportation of the Danish police|deportations of nearly 2,000 of its members]], the police remained largely under Danish control, and the German authorities stayed one step removed from the population. However, the Nazi demands eventually became intolerable for the Danish government, so, in 1943, it resigned and Germany assumed full control of Denmark. From that point, an armed resistance movement grew against the occupying forces. Towards the end of the war, Denmark grew increasingly difficult for Germany to control, but the country remained under occupation until near the end of the war. On 4 May 1945, German forces in Denmark, North West Germany, and the Netherlands surrendered to the Allies. On 5 May 1945, British troops liberated Copenhagen. Three days later, the war ended.\n\nDenmark succeeded in smuggling most of its Jewish population to Sweden, in 1943, when the Nazis threatened deportation; see [[Rescue of the Danish Jews]]. Danish doctors refused to treat German citizens fleeing from Germany. Some 13,000 died in 1945 from various causes.<ref>Manfred Ertel.

Denmark had originally tried to form an alliance with Norway and Sweden only, but this attempt had failed. A [[Nordic Council]] later emerged however, with the aim of co-ordinating Nordic policies. Later on, in a [[1972 Danish European Communities membership referendum|referendum in 1972]], Danes voted in favour of joining the [[European Community]], the predecessor of the [[European Union]], and Denmark became a member on 1 January 1973. Since then, Denmark has proven a hesitant member of the European community, opting out of many proposals, including the [[Euro]], which the country rejected in a [[2000 Danish euro referendum|referendum in 2000]].\n\n== 21st century ==\n[[File:President George W.

Eight years later, he resigned from his office in April 2009 due to upcoming as the [[Secretary General of NATO|NATO Secretary-General]], and then [[Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen]] will be sworn in as Prime Minister in his first term from 2009 to 2011.\n\nIn the [[2011 Danish general election|2011 Folketing elections]], the incumbent centre-right coalition led by Venstre lost power to a centre-left coalition led by the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] making [[Helle Thorning-Schmidt]], the country's first female Prime Minister.

These early documents include the writings of [[Jordanes]] and [[Procopius]]. With the [[Christianization of Scandinavia#Denmark|Christianization of the Danes]] c. 960 AD, it is clear that there existed a kingship. Queen [[Margrethe II]] can trace her lineage back to the [[Viking]] kings [[Gorm the Old]] and [[Harald Bluetooth]] from this time, thus making the [[Monarchy of Denmark]] the oldest in Europe.<ref>http://madmonaco.blogspot.com/2010/06/oldest-monarchy.html http://www.royalinsight.net/content/danish-monarchy-overview {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015221435/http://royalinsight.net/content/danish-monarchy-overview |date=2012-10-15 }}</ref> The area now known as [[Denmark]] has a rich [[prehistory]], having been populated by several prehistoric cultures and people for about 12,000 years, since the end of the [[Paleolithic|last ice age]].\n\nDenmark's history has particularly been influenced by its geographical location between the [[North Sea|North]] and [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] seas, a strategically and economically important placement between [[Sweden]] and [[Germany]], at the center of mutual struggles for control of the Baltic Sea (''[[dominium maris baltici]]''). Denmark was long in disputes with Sweden over control of [[Sk\u00e5nelandene]] and with Germany over control of [[Schleswig]] (a Danish [[fief]]) and [[Holstein]] (a German fief).\n\nEventually, Denmark lost these conflicts and ended up ceding first [[Sk\u00e5neland]] to Sweden and later [[Schleswig-Holstein]] to the [[German Empire]]. After the eventual cession of [[Norway in 1814]], Denmark retained control of the old Norwegian colonies of the [[Faroe Islands]], [[Greenland]] and [[Iceland]]. During the 20th century, Iceland gained independence, Greenland and the Faroese became integral parts of the [[Kingdom of Denmark]] and [[North Schleswig]] reunited with Denmark in 1920 after a referendum. During [[World War II]], Denmark was [[Occupation of Denmark|occupied]] by [[Nazi Germany]], but was eventually liberated by British forces of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in 1945,<ref>The remote Danish island of [[Bornholm]] in the Baltic Sea was liberated by Soviet forces of the Allies. This led to some political turmoil and conflict, occasionally resurfacing in modern times.</ref> after which it joined the [[United Nations]]. In the aftermath of World War II, and with the emergence of the subsequent [[Cold War]], Denmark was quick to join the military alliance of [[Member states of NATO|NATO]] as a founding member in 1949.\n\n== Prehistoric Denmark ==\n{{see also|Prehistory of Scandinavia}}\nThe Scandinavian region has a rich [[prehistory]], having been populated by several prehistoric cultures and people for about 12,000 years, since the end of the [[Weichselian glaciation|last ice age]]. During the ice age, all of Scandinavia was covered by [[glacier]]s most of the time, except for the southwestern parts of what we now know as Denmark. When the ice began retreating, the barren tundras were soon inhabited by reindeer and elk, and [[Ahrensburg culture|Ahrenburg]] and [[Swiderian culture|Swiderian]] hunters from the south followed them here to hunt occasionally. The geography then was very different from what we know today. Sea levels were much lower; the island of [[Great Britain]] was connected by a land bridge to mainland Europe and the large area between Great Britain and the [[Jutland|Jutlandic peninsula]] - now beneath the [[North Sea]] and known as [[Doggerland]] - was inhabited by tribes of hunter-gatherers. As the climate warmed up, forceful rivers of meltwater started to flow and shape the virgin lands, and more stable flora and fauna gradually began emerging in Scandinavia, and Denmark in particular. The first human settlers to inhabit Denmark and Scandinavia permanently were the [[Maglemosian culture|Maglemosian people]], residing in seasonal camps and exploiting the land, sea, rivers and lakes. It was not until around 6,000 BC that the approximate geography of Denmark as we know it today had been shaped.\n\nDenmark has some unique natural conditions for preservation of artifacts, providing [[Archaeology of Denmark|a rich and diverse archeological record]] from which to understand the prehistoric cultures of this area.\n\n=== Stone and Bronze Age ===\n[[File:Br\u00e6nde-Stene.jpg|400px|right|thumb|Stone Dolmen near Vinstrup, N\u00f8rhald. Built in the 3rd millennium BC.]]\n{{see also|Neolithic|Nordic Stone Age|Nordic Bronze Age}} \nThe [[Last glacial period|Weichsel glaciation]] covered all of Denmark most of the time, except the western coasts of Jutland. It ended around 13,000 years ago, allowing humans to move back into the previously ice-covered territories and establish permanent habitation. During the first post-glacial millennia, the landscape gradually changed from [[tundra]] to light forest, and varied fauna including now-extinct [[megafauna]] appeared. Early prehistoric cultures uncovered in modern Denmark include the [[Maglemosian Culture]] (9,500-6,000 BC); the [[Kongemose culture]] (6,000-5,200 BC), the [[Erteb\u00f8lle culture]] (5,300-3,950 BC), and the [[Funnelbeaker culture]] (4,100-2,800 BC).\n\n[[Image:Solvognen - Do 2010 1276.jpg|thumb|left|The famous [[Trundholm sun chariot]] (called ''[[Solvognen]]'' in Danish), a sculpture of the sun pulled by a mare. Scholars have dated it to some time in the 15th century BC and believe that it illustrates an important concept expressed in [[Nordic Bronze Age]] mythology.]]\nThe first inhabitants of this early post-glacial landscape in the so-called [[Boreal (period)|Boreal period]], were very small and scattered populations living from hunting of [[reindeer]] and other land mammals and gathering whatever fruits the climate was able to offer. Around 8,300 BC the temperature rose drastically, now with summer temperatures around 15 degrees Celsius, and the landscape changed into dense forests of [[aspen]], [[birch]] and [[pine]] and the reindeer moved north, while [[aurochs]] and [[moose|elk]] arrived from the south.

The inhabitants then shifted to a seafood based diet, which allowed the population to increase.\n\n[[Agriculture|Agricultural]] settlers made inroads around 3,000 BC. Many [[dolmen]]s and rock tombs (especially [[passage grave]]s) date from this period. The [[Nordic Bronze Age]] period in Denmark, from about 1,500 BC, featured a culture that buried its dead, with their worldly goods, beneath [[Tumulus|burial mounds]]. The many finds of gold and bronze from this era include beautiful religious artifacts and musical instruments, and provide the earliest evidence of [[social class]]es and [[Social stratification|stratification]].\n\n{{clear left}}\n\n=== Iron Age ===\n{{see also|Nordic Iron Age}}\n[[File:Gundestrup cauldron - F.I.4277.jpg|thumb|The silver [[Gundestrup Cauldron]], with what some scholars interpret as Celtic depictions, exemplifies the trade relations of the period.]]\nDuring the [[Pre-Roman Iron Age]] (from the 4th to the 1st century BC), the climate in Denmark and southern [[Scandinavia]] became cooler and wetter, limiting agriculture and setting the stage for local groups to migrate southward into [[Germania]]. At around this time people began to extract iron from the [[bog iron|ore]] in [[peat bog]]s. Evidence of strong [[Celts|Celtic]] cultural influence dates from this period in Denmark, and in much of northwest Europe, and survives in some of the older place names.\n\nFrom the first to the fifth century, the [[Roman Empire]] interacted with Jutland and the Danish isles in many ways, ranging from commerce to a possible \"client state\" relationship.<ref>[http://researchomnia.blogspot.com/2015/08/roman-client-state-in-denmark.html Roman \"client state\" in Denmark]</ref> This period is therefore referred to as the Roman Iron Age.\n\nThe [[Roman Empire|Roman provinces]], whose frontiers stopped short of Denmark, nevertheless maintained trade routes and relations with Danish or proto-Danish peoples, as attested by finds of Roman coins. The earliest known [[runic]] inscription dates back to c. 200 AD. Depletion of cultivated land in the last century BC seems to have contributed to increasing migrations in northern Europe and increasing conflict between Teutonic tribes and Roman settlements in [[Gaul]]. Roman artifacts are especially common in finds from the 1st century. It seems clear that some part of the Danish warrior [[aristocracy]] served in the [[Roman army]].<ref>Birger Storgaard, ''Cosmopolitan aristocrats'', pp. 106-125 in: ''The Spoils of Victory - The North in the shadow of the Roman Empire'', Nationalmuseet, 2003. {{ISBN|87-7602-006-1}}.</ref>\n\nOccasionally during this time, both animal and [[human sacrifice]] occurred and bodies were immersed in [[bog]]s. In {{As of|2008|alt= recent times}} some of these [[bog body|bog bodies]] have emerged very well-preserved, providing valuable information about the religion and people who lived in Denmark during this period. Some of the most well-preserved bog bodies from the Nordic Iron Age are the [[Tollund Man]] and the [[Grauballe Man]].\n\nFrom around the 5th to the 7th century, [[Northern Europe]] experienced mass migrations. This period and its [[material culture]] are referred to as the [[Germanic Iron Age]].\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"160px\" heights=\"130\">\nFile:Tollundmannen.jpg|The face of Tollundmanden, one of the best preserved bog body finds.\nFile:Dejbjerg wagon, Nationalmuseet Copenhagen.jpg|The [[Dejbjerg wagon]] from the Pre-Roman Iron Age, thought to be a ceremonial wagon.\nFile:Nydamboat.2.jpg|The [[Nydam Mose|Nydam oak boat]], a [[ship burial]] from the Roman Iron Age.

The Danish people were among those known as [[Viking]]s, during the 8th\u201311th centuries. Viking explorers first discovered and settled in [[Iceland]] in the 9th century, on their way from the [[Faroe Islands]]. From there, [[Greenland]] and [[Vinland]] (probably [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]) were also settled. Utilizing their great skills in shipbuilding and navigation they raided and conquered parts of [[France]] and the [[British Isles]].\n\n[[File:Aros viking town.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The fortified Viking town of [[Aarhus|Aros]] ([[Aarhus]]), 950 AD.]]\nThey also excelled in trading along the coasts and rivers of Europe, running trade routes from Greenland in the north to [[Constantinople]] in the south via [[Russia]]n and [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] rivers, most notably along the River [[Dnieper]] and via Kiev, then being the capital of [[Kiev Rus]]. The Danish Vikings were most active in Britain, [[Ireland]], [[France]], [[Spain]], Portugal and Italy where they raided, conquered and settled (their earliest settlements included sites in the [[Danelaw]], [[Ireland]] and [[Normandy]]). The Danelaw encompassed the Northeastern half of what now constitutes [[England]], where Danes settled and Danish law and rule prevailed. Prior to this time, England consisted of approximately seven independent [[Anglo-Saxon]] kingdoms. The Danes conquered (terminated) all of these except for the kingdom of [[Wessex]]. [[Alfred the Great]], king of Wessex, emerged from these trials as the sole remaining English king, and thereby as the first English [[Monarch]].\n\nIn the early 9th century, [[Charlemagne]]'s Christian empire had expanded to the southern border of the Danes, and Frankish sources (e.g. [[Notker the Stammerer|Notker of St Gall]]) provide the earliest historical evidence of the Danes. These report a King [[Gudfred]], who appeared in present-day [[Holstein]] with a navy in 804 where diplomacy took place with the [[Franks]]; In 808, King Gudfred attacked the [[Obotrites]] and conquered the city of [[Reric]] whose population was displaced or abducted to [[Hedeby]]. In 809, King Godfred and emissaries of Charlemagne failed to negotiate peace, despite the sister of Godfred being a concubine of Charlemagne, and the next year King Godfred attacked the [[Frisians]] with 200 ships.\n\nViking raids along the coast of France and the Netherlands were large-scale. Paris was besieged and the Loire Valley devastated during the 10th century. One group of Danes was granted permission to settle in northwestern France under the condition that they defend the place from future attacks. As a result, the region became known as \"Normandy\" and it was the descendants of these settlers who conquered England in 1066.\n\n[[File:Dannevirke.english.png|thumb|left|upright=1.0|Map showing [[Danevirke]] and [[H\u00e6rvejen]].]]\nIn addition, a few Danes are believed to have participated with the Norwegians who moved west into the Atlantic Ocean, settling in the [[Shetland Isles]], the [[Faeroe Islands]], [[Iceland]], and [[Greenland]]. The Greenland Norse persisted from about 1000 AD to about 1450 AD. Seasonal trading camps have been recently discovered on [[Baffin Island]] containing European cordage, metal traces, masonry, and rat remains. Brief Viking expeditions to North America around 1000 did not result in any lasting settlements. Other Viking raids into Germany and the Mediterranean were short-lived and had no lasting effect.\n\nThe oldest parts of the defensive works of Danevirke near [[Hedeby]] at least date from the summer of 755 and were expanded with large works in the 10th century. The size and number of troops needed to man it indicates a quite powerful ruler in the area, which might be consistent with the kings of the Frankish sources. In 815 AD, Emperor [[Louis the Pious]] attacked Jutland apparently in support of a contender to the throne, perhaps [[Harald Klak]], but was turned back by the sons of Godfred, who most likely were the sons of the above-mentioned Godfred. At the same time [[Ansgar|St. Ansgar]] travelled to Hedeby and started the Catholic [[Christianisation of Scandinavia]].\n\n[[Gorm the Old]] ({{lang-da|Gorm den Gamle}}, {{lang-non|Gormr gamli}}, {{lang-la|Gormus Senex}}<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/gri_33125008656585|page=[https://archive.org/details/gri_33125008656585/page/n391 338]|quote=gormus senex.|title=De origine et usu obeliscorum|last=Zoega|first=Georg|date=1797-01-01|publisher=Typis Lazzarinii Typographi Cameralis|language=la}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zQX5Hd1YQtoC&pg=PA557&lpg=PA557&dq=%22gormus+senex%22#v=onepage&q=%22gormus%20senex%22&f=false|title=Thormodi Torf\u00e6i ...

The extent of Harald's Danish Kingdom is unknown, although it is reasonable to believe that it stretched from the defensive line of Dannevirke, including the Viking city of Hedeby, across Jutland, the Danish isles and into southern present day [[Sweden]]; [[Scania]] and perhaps [[Halland]] and [[Blekinge]]. Furthermore, the Jelling stones attest that Harald had also \"won\" [[Norway]].<ref name=\"Britannica Online Encyclopedia\">Staff.

By 1014, England had completely submitted to the Danes. However, distance and a lack of common interests prevented a lasting union, and Harald's son [[Cnut the Great]] barely maintained the link between the two countries, which completely broke up during the reign of his son [[Hardecanute]]. A final attempt by the Norwegians under [[Harald Hardrada]] to reconquer England failed, but did pave the way for William the Conqueror's takeover in 1066.<ref name=\"Britannica Online Encyclopedia\"/>\n\n=== Christianity, expansion and the establishment of the Kingdom of Denmark ===\n{{see also|North Sea Empire}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| image1 = Jelling gr Stein 1.JPG\n| width1 = 250\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Jelling gr Stein 3.JPG\n| width2 = 141\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Often regarded as Denmark's \"birth certificate\", the large [[Jelling stones|Jelling Stone]] announces the unification and Christianization of Denmark by [[Harald Bluetooth]] c. 980\n}}\n\nThe history of [[Christianity]] in Denmark overlaps with that of the Viking Age. Various petty kingdoms existed throughout the area now known as Denmark for many years. Between c. 960 and the early 980s, [[Harald Bluetooth]] appears to have established a kingdom in the lands of the Danes which stretched from Jutland to Sk\u00e5ne. Around the same time, he received a visit from a German [[missionary]] who, according to legend,<ref>Adam of Bremen, History of the Archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen, trans. Francis J. Tschan (New York, 2002), pp. 77\u201378.</ref> survived an [[trial by ordeal|ordeal by fire]], which convinced Harald to convert to [[Christianity]].\n\nThe new [[religion]], which replaced the old [[Norse mythology|Norse religious practices]], had many advantages for the king. Christianity brought with it some support from the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. It also allowed the king to dismiss many of his opponents who adhered to the old mythology. At this early stage there is no evidence that the Danish Church was able to create a stable administration that Harald could use to exercise more effective control over his kingdom, but it may have contributed to the development of a centralising political and religious ideology among the social elite which sustained and enhanced an increasingly powerful kingship.\n\n[[England]] broke away from Danish control in 1035 and Denmark fell into disarray for some time. Sweyn Estridsen's son, [[Canute IV of Denmark|Canute IV]], raided England for the last time in 1085. He planned another invasion to take the [[List of English monarchs|throne of England]] from an aging [[William I of England|William I]]. He called up a fleet of 1,000 Danish ships, 60 Norwegian [[Longship|long boats]], with plans to meet with another 600 ships under [[Robert I, Count of Flanders|Duke Robert of Flanders]] in the summer of 1086. Canute, however, was beginning to realise that the imposition of the tithe on Danish peasants and nobles to fund the expansion of monasteries and churches and a new [[Tax per head|head tax]] (Danish:nefgjald) had brought his people to the verge of rebellion. Canute took weeks to arrive where the fleet had assembled at Struer, but he found only the [[Norway|Norwegians]] still there.\n\nCanute thanked the Norwegians for their patience and then went from assembly to assembly (Danish:landsting) outlawing any sailor, captain or soldier who refused to pay a fine which amounted to more than a years harvest for most farmers. Canute and his [[Housecarl|housecarls]] fled south with a growing army of rebels on his heels. Canute fled to the royal property outside the town of Odense on Funen with his two brothers. After several attempts to break in and then bloody hand-to-hand fighting in the church, Benedict was cut down, and Canute was struck in the head by a large stone and then speared from the front. He died at the base of the main altar on 10 July 1086, where he was buried by the Benedictines. When Queen Edele came to take Canute's body to Flanders, a light allegedly shone around the church and it was taken as a sign that Canute should remain where he was.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole paragraph. The last sentence reads like a legend.|date=May 2012}}\n\nThe death of St. Canute marks the end of the Viking Age. Never again would massive flotillas of [[Scandinavia]]ns meet each year to ravage the rest of Christian Europe.\n\nCanute's nephew [[Sweyn II of Denmark|Sweyn Estridson]] (1020\u201374) re-established strong royal Danish authority and built a good relationship with [[Archbishop]] [[Adalbert of Hamburg]]-[[Archbishopric of Bremen|Bremen]] \u2014 at that time the Archbishop of all of [[Scandinavia]].\n\nIn the early 12th century, Denmark became the seat of an independent [[ecclesiastical province|church province]] of Scandinavia. Not long after that, [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]] established their own archbishoprics, free of Danish control. The mid-12th century proved a difficult time for the kingdom of Denmark. Violent [[civil war]]s rocked the land. Eventually, [[Valdemar I of Denmark|Valdemar the Great]] (1131\u201382), gained control of the kingdom, stabilizing it and reorganizing the administration. King Valdemar and [[Absalon]] (''ca'' 1128\u20131201), the [[Roskilde (titular see)|bishop of Roskilde]], rebuilt the country.\n\nDuring Valdemar's reign construction began of a castle in the village of Havn, leading eventually to the foundation of [[Copenhagen]], the modern capital of Denmark. Valdemar and Absalon built Denmark into a major power in the [[Baltic Sea]], a power which later competed with the [[Hanseatic League]], the counts of [[Holstein]], and the [[Teutonic Knights]] for trade, territory, and influence throughout the Baltic. In 1168, Valdemar and Absalon gained a foothold on the southern shore of the Baltic, when they subdued the [[Principality of R\u00fcgen]].\n\nIn the 1180s, [[Mecklenburg]] and the [[Duchy of Pomerania]] came under Danish control, too. In the new southern provinces, the Danes promoted Christianity (mission of the [[Rani (Slavic tribe)|Rani]], monasteries like [[Eldena Abbey]]) and settlement (Danish participation in the ''[[Ostsiedlung]]''). The Danes lost most of their southern gains after the [[Battle of Bornh\u00f6ved (1227)]], but the Rugian principality stayed with Denmark until 1325.\n\n{{Scandinavia map, 1219}}\n\nIn 1202, [[Valdemar II of Denmark|Valdemar II]] became king and launched various \"[[crusades]]\" to claim territories, notably modern [[Estonia]]. Once these efforts were successful, a period in history known as the [[Danish Estonia]] began. Legend has it that the Danish flag, the [[Flag of Denmark|Dannebrog]] fell from the sky during the [[Battle of Lyndanisse|Battle of Lindanise]] in Estonia in 1219. A series of Danish defeats culminating in the Battle of Bornh\u00f6ved on 22 July 1227 cemented the loss of Denmark's north German territories. Valdemar himself was saved only by the courageous actions of a German knight who carried Valdemar to safety on his horse.\n\nFrom that time on, Valdemar focused his efforts on domestic affairs. One of the changes he instituted was the feudal system where he gave properties to men with the understanding that they owed him service. This increased the power of the noble families ({{lang-da|h\u00f8jadelen}}) and gave rise to the lesser nobles ({{lang-da|lavadelen}}) who controlled most of Denmark. Free peasants lost the traditional rights and privileges they had enjoyed since Viking times.[3]\n\nThe king of Denmark had difficulty maintaining control of the kingdom in the face of opposition from the [[nobility]] and from the Church. An extended period of strained relations between the crown and the [[Pope]]s of [[Rome]] took place, known as the \"archiepiscopal conflicts\".\n\nBy the late 13th century, royal power had waned, and the nobility forced the king to grant a [[charter]], considered Denmark's first [[constitution]]. Following the [[Battle of Bornh\u00f6ved (1227)|Battle of Bornh\u00f6ved]] in 1227, a weakened Denmark provided windows of opportunity to both the Hanseatic League and the [[count of Holstein|Counts of Holstein]]. The Holstein Counts gained control of large portions of Denmark because the king would grant them fiefs in exchange for money to finance royal operations.\n\nValdemar spent the remainder of his life putting together a code of laws for [[Jutland]], [[Zealand]] and [[Sk\u00e5ne]]. These codes were used as Denmark's legal code until 1683. This was a significant change from the local law making at the regional assemblies ({{lang-da|landting}}), which had been the long-standing tradition. Several methods of determining guilt or innocence were outlawed including trial by ordeal and trial by combat. The [[Code of Jutland]] ({{lang-da|Jyske Lov}}) was approved at meeting of the nobility at Vordingborg in 1241 just prior to Valdemar's death. Because of his position as \"the king of Dannebrog\" and as a legislator, Valdemar enjoys a central position in Danish history. To posterity the civil wars and dissolution that followed his death made him appear to be the last king of a golden age.\n\nThe [[Middle Ages]] saw a period of close cooperation between the [[The Crown|Crown]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Thousands of church buildings sprang up throughout the country during this time. The economy expanded during the 12th century, based mostly on the lucrative [[herring]]-trade, but the 13th century turned into a period of difficulty and saw the temporary collapse of royal authority.\n\n=== Count rule ===\n[[File:Danmarks kongel\u00f8se tid.png|thumb|left|upright=1.1|The kingless time 1332\u20131340]]\nDuring the disastrous reign of [[Christopher II of Denmark|Christopher II]] (1319\u20131332), most of the country was seized by the provincial counts (except Sk\u00e5ne, which was taken over by Sweden) after numerous peasant revolts and conflicts with the Church. For eight years after Christopher's death, Denmark had no king, and was instead controlled by the counts. After one of them, [[Gerhard III of Holstein-Rendsburg]], was assassinated in 1340, Christopher's son [[Valdemar IV of Denmark|Valdemar]] was chosen as king, and gradually began to recover the territories, which was finally completed in 1360.\n\nThe [[Black Death]], which came to Denmark during these years, also aided Valdemar's campaign. His continued efforts to expand the kingdom after 1360 brought him into open conflict with the Hanseatic League. He conquered [[Gotland]], much to the displeasure of the League, which lost [[Visby]], an important trading town located there.\n\nThe Hanseatic alliance with Sweden to attack Denmark initially proved a fiasco since Danish forces captured a large Hanseatic fleet, and ransomed it back for an enormous sum. Luckily for the League, the Jutland nobles revolted against the heavy taxes levied to fight the expansionist war in the Baltic; the two forces worked against the king, forcing him into exile in 1370. For several years, the Hanseatic League controlled the fortresses on \"[[\u00d6resund|the sound]]\" between Sk\u00e5ne and Zealand.\n\n=== Margaret and the Kalmar Union (1397\u20131523)===\n{{main|Kalmar Union}}\n\n[[Margaret I of Denmark|Margaret I]], the daughter of Valdemar Atterdag, found herself married off to [[Haakon VI of Norway|H\u00e5kon VI of Norway]] in an attempt to join the two kingdoms, along with Sweden, since H\u00e5kon had kinship ties to the Swedish royal family. The dynastic plans called for her son, [[Olaf IV of Norway|Olaf II]] to rule the three kingdoms, but after his early death in 1387 she took on the role herself (1387\u20131412). During her lifetime (1353\u20131412) the three kingdoms of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden (including the [[Faroe Islands]], as well as [[Iceland]], [[Greenland]], and present-day [[Finland]]) became linked under her capable rule, in what became known as the [[Kalmar Union]], made official in 1397.\n[[File:Roskilde Margrethe1 grave.jpg|thumb|250px|The tomb of [[Margaret I of Denmark|Margaret I]] in [[Roskilde Cathedral]].]]\n\nHer successor, [[Eric VII of Denmark|Eric of Pomerania]] (King of Denmark from 1412 to 1439), lacked Margaret's skill and thus directly caused the breakup of the Kalmar Union. Eric's foreign policy engulfed Denmark in a succession of wars with the Holstein counts and the city of L\u00fcbeck. When the Hanseatic League imposed a trade embargo on Scandinavia, the Swedes (who saw their mining industry adversely affected) rose up in revolt. The three countries of the Kalmar Union all declared Eric deposed in 1439.\n\nHowever, support for the idea of regionalism continued, so when Eric's nephew [[Christopher of Bavaria]] came to the throne in 1440, he managed to get himself elected in all three kingdoms, briefly reuniting Scandinavia (1442\u20131448). The Swedish nobility grew increasingly unhappy with Danish rule and the union soon became merely a legal concept with little practical application. During the subsequent reigns of Christian I (1450\u20131481) and Hans (1481\u20131513), tensions grew, and several wars between Sweden and Denmark erupted.\n\nIn the early 16th century, [[Christian II of Denmark|Christian II]] (reigned 1513\u20131523) came to power. He allegedly declared, \"If the hat on my head knew what I was thinking, I would pull it off and throw it away.\" This quotation apparently refers to his devious and [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli|machiavellian]] political dealings. He conquered Sweden in an attempt to reinforce the union, and had about 100 leaders of the Swedish anti-unionist forces killed in what came to be known as the [[Stockholm Bloodbath]] of November 1520. The bloodbath destroyed any lingering hope of Scandinavian union.\n\nIn the aftermath of [[Sweden]]'s definitive secession from the [[Kalmar Union]] in 1521, [[civil war]] and the [[Protestant Reformation]] followed in Denmark and Norway. When things settled down, the [[Privy Council]] of Denmark had lost some of its influence, and that of Norway no longer existed. The two kingdoms, known as [[Denmark\u2013Norway]], operated in a personal union under a single monarch. Norway kept its separate laws and some institutions, such as a royal [[chancellor]], separate coinage and a separate army. As a hereditary kingdom, Norway's status as separate from Denmark remained important to the royal dynasty in its struggles to win elections as kings of Denmark. The two kingdoms remained tied until 1814.\n\n== Early Modern Denmark ==\n[[Image:Daniaeregnitypvs.jpg|thumb|right|250px| Abraham Ortelius's 1570 map of Denmark including parts on the Scandinavian peninsula.]]\n\n=== The Reformation ===\n{{main|Reformation in Denmark\u2013Norway and Holstein}}\n[[Image:Hans Tausen - Jacob Kornerup efter maleri i Ribe Domkirke.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Hans Tausen]] was one of the first Lutheran preachers, and later a bishop, in Denmark.]]\nThe [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], which originated in the German lands in the early 16th century from the ideas of [[Martin Luther]] (1483\u20131546), had a considerable impact on Denmark. The Danish Reformation started in the mid-1520s. Some Danes wanted access to the [[Bible]] in their own language. In 1524 Hans Mikkelsen and [[Christiern Pedersen]] translated the [[New Testament]] into Danish; it became an instant best-seller.<ref name=\"runeberg.org\"/>\n\nThose who had traveled to [[Wittenberg]] in Saxony and come under the influence of the teachings of [[Martin Luther|Luther]] and his associates included [[Hans Tausen]], a Danish monk in the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of St John Hospitallers]]. On Good Friday in 1525, Tausen used the pulpit at [[Antvorskov]] Abbey Church to proclaim Luther's reforms. His scandalized superiors ordered him out of Zealand and held him in the priory at [[Viborg, Denmark|Viborg]] under close confinement until he should come to his senses.<ref name=\"runeberg.org\">{{cite web\n|url= http://runeberg.org/dbl/17/\n|title= Tausen, Hans, 1494-1561, evangelisk Reformator og Biskop\n|accessdate= 2008-09-09\n|author= C.

Within days Tausen's ideas swept through the town. The then radical ideas of Luther found a receptive audience. Tausen's preaching converted ordinary people, merchants, nobles, and monks and even the Prior grew to appreciate Tausen and ordered his release. Tausen preached openly: much to the consternation of Bishop J\u00f8n Friis, who lost his ability to do anything about the Lutherans and retreated to Hald Castle.<ref name=\"runeberg.org\"/>\n\nAfter preaching in the open air, Tausen gained the use of a small chapel, which soon proved too small for the crowds who attended services in Danish. His followers broke open a Franciscan Abbey so they could listen to Tausen, who packed the church daily for services. The town leaders protected Tausen from the Bishop of Viborg.<ref name=\"runeberg.org\"/>\nViborg became the center for the Danish Reformation for a time. Lutheranism spread quickly to [[Aarhus]] and [[Aalborg]].\n\nWithin months King [[Frederick I of Denmark|Frederick]] appointed Tausen as one of his personal chaplains (October 1526) in order to protect him from Catholics. Tausen's version of Luther's ideas spread throughout Denmark. Copenhagen became a hotbed of reformist activity and Tausen moved there to continue his work. His reputation preceded him and the excitement of hearing the liturgy in Danish brought thousands of people out to hear him. With the kings' permission, churches in Copenhagen opened their doors to the Lutherans and held services for Catholics and for Lutherans at different times of the day.\n\nAt Our Lady Church, the main church of Copenhagen, Bishop Ronnow refused to admit the \"heretics\". In December 1531, a mob stormed the [[Church of Our Lady, Copenhagen|Church of Our Lady]] in Copenhagen, encouraged by Copenhagen's fiery mayor, [[Ambrosius Bogbinder]]. They tore down statues and side-altars and destroyed artwork and reliquaries. Frederick I's policy of toleration insisted that the two competing groups share churches and pulpits peacefully, but this satisfied neither Lutherans nor Catholics.\n\nLuther's ideas spread rapidly as a consequence of a powerful combination of popular enthusiasm for church reform and a royal eagerness to secure greater wealth through the seizure of church lands and property. In Denmark the reformation increased the crown's revenues by 300%.\n\n==== Dissatisfaction with the Catholic Church ====\nDissatisfaction with the established Catholic Church had already been widespread in Denmark. Many people viewed the [[tithe]]s and fees \u2014 a constant source of irritation for farmers and merchants \u2014 as unjust. This became apparent once word got out that King Frederick and his son, [[Christian III of Denmark|Duke Christian]] had no sympathy with Franciscans who persistently made the rounds of the parishes to collect food, money, and clothing in addition to the tithes. Between 1527 and 1536 many towns petitioned the king to close the Franciscan houses.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Kr\u00f8nike om Gr\u00e5brodrenes Udjagelse''\n</ref>\n\nFrederick obliged by sending letters authorizing the closure of the monasteries, often offering a small sum of money to help the brothers on their way. With the royal letter in hand, mobs forcibly closed [[Franciscan]] abbeys all over Denmark. They beat up monks, two of whom died.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The closure of Franciscan houses occurred systematically in Copenhagen, Viborg, Aalborg, Randers, Malm\u00f6 and ten other cities; in all, 28 monasteries or houses closed. People literally hounded Franciscan monks out of the towns.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nNo other order faced such harsh treatment. Considering how strongly many people felt about removing all traces of Catholic traditions from Danish churches, surprisingly little violence took place. Luther's teaching had become so overwhelmingly popular that Danes systematically cleared churches of statues, paintings, wall-hangings, reliquaries and other Catholic elements without interference. The only exceptions came in individual churches where the local churchmen refused to permit reform.\n\n[[Image:Christian III of Denmark.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Christian III of Denmark|King Christian III]] carried out the Protestant Reformation in Slesvig, Holsten, Denmark and Norway.]]\n[[Frederick I of Denmark|Frederick I]] died in 1533; the Viborg Assembly (Danish:landsting) [[Election of Christian III|proclaimed his son, Duke Christian of Schleswig, King Christian III]]. The State Council (Danish: Rigsr\u00e5d) on Zealand, led by the Catholic bishops, took control of the country and refused to recognize the election of Christian III, a staunch Lutheran. The regents feared Christian's zeal for Luther's ideas would tip the balance and disenfranchise Catholics \u2014 both peasants and nobles.\n\nThe State Council encouraged Count [[Christopher of Oldenburg]] to become Regent of Denmark. Christian III quickly raised an army to enforce his election, including mercenary troops from Germany. Count Christopher raised an army (including troops from [[Mecklenburg]] and [[Oldenburg]] and the Hanseatic League, especially [[L\u00fcbeck]]) to restore his Catholic uncle King [[Christian II]] (deposed in 1523). This resulted in a three-year civil war called the [[Count's Feud]] (Danish: ''Grevens Fejde'').\n\n==== Count's Feud (1534\u20131536) ====\nArmed rebellion by Catholic peasants led by [[Skipper Clement]] started in northern Jutland. Rebellion swept across [[Funen]], Zealand and Sk\u00e5ne. Christian III's army soundly defeated an army of Catholic nobles at Svenstrup on 16 October 1534. Christian forced a truce with the [[Hanseatic League]], which had sent troops to help Count Christopher. Christian III's army, under [[Johan Rantzau]], chased the rebels all the way back to [[Aalborg]] and then massacred over 2,000 of them inside the city in December 1534.\n\nThe Protestants captured Skipper Clement (1534), and later executed him in 1536. Christian III's mercenary troops put an end to Catholic hopes on Zealand and then Funen. Sk\u00e5ne rebels went as far as proclaiming Christian II king again. King [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav Vasa]] of Sweden sent two separate armies to ravage [[Halland]] and Sk\u00e5ne into submission. Besiegers finally starved the last hold-outs in the rebellion, Copenhagen and [[Malm\u00f8]], into surrender in July 1536. By the spring of 1536, Christian III had taken firm control.\n\n==== State Lutheranism ====\nDenmark became officially Lutheran on 30 October 1536 by decree of King Christian III, and in 1537 the reconstituted State Council approved the [[Church Order (Lutheran)|Lutheran Ordinances]] which was worked out by Danish theologians and [[Johannes Bugenhagen]], based on the [[Augsburg Confession]] and Luther's [[Small Catechism|Little Catechism]]. The government established the Danish National Church (Danish: ''Folkekirken'') as the [[state church]]. All of Denmark's Catholic bishops went to prison until such time as they converted to Luther's reform. The authorities released them when they promised to marry and to support the reforms.\n\nIf they agreed, they received property and spent the rest of their lives as wealthy landowners. If they refused conversion, they died in prison. The State confiscated Church lands to pay for the armies that had enforced Christian III's election. Priests swore allegiance to Lutheranism or found new employment. The new owners turned monks out of their monasteries and abbeys. Nuns in a few places gained permission to live out their lives in nunneries, though without governmental financial support. The Crown closed churches, abbeys, priories and cathedrals, giving their property to local nobles or selling it.\n\nThe King appointed Danish superintendents (later bishops) to oversee Lutheran orthodoxy in the church. Denmark became part of a Lutheran heartland extending through Scandinavia and northern Germany. The Catholic Church everywhere in Scandinavia had sealed its fate by supporting hopeless causes: Christian II and the emperor Charles V in Denmark, Norwegian independence in that country, and in Sweden the Kalmar Union. Geographical distance also prevented them from receiving anything more than a sympathetic ear from Rome.\n\nThe 17th century saw a period of strict Lutheran [[orthodoxy]] in Denmark, with harsh punishments visited on suspected followers of either [[John Calvin|Calvinism]] or [[Huldrych Zwingli]]. Lutheran authorities treated Catholics harshly \u2014 in the fear that they might undermine the king, government, and national church. In a delayed result of the Reformation, Denmark became embroiled in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) on the Protestant side.\n\n=== The loss of Eastern Denmark ===\n{{see also|Dominium maris baltici}}\n\nThe [[Denmark\u2013Norway|Dano-Norwegian Kingdom]] grew wealthy during the 16th century, largely because of the increased traffic through the [[\u00d8resund]], which Danes could tax because Denmark controlled both sides of the Sound. The trade in grain exports from [[Poland]] to the [[Netherlands]] and to the rest of Europe grew enormously at this time, and the Danish kings did not hesitate to cash in on it. The Sound duty was only repealed in the 1840s.\n\nThe Danish economy benefited from the [[Eighty Years' War]] (1568\u20131648) in the [[Netherlands]] because a large number of skilled refugees from that area (the most economically advanced in Europe) came to Denmark. This helped to modernize many aspects of society and to establish trading links between Denmark and the Netherlands.\n\n[[Denmark\u2013Norway]] had a reputation as a relatively powerful kingdom at this time. European politics of the 16th century revolved largely around the struggle between Catholic and Protestant forces, so it seemed almost inevitable that Denmark, a strong, unified Lutheran kingdom, would get drawn into the larger war when it came. The [[Thirty Years' War]] went badly for the Protestant states in the early 1620s, and a call went out to [[Denmark\u2013Norway]] to \"save the Protestant cause\".\n\nKing [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]], who was also a duke of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] on the basis of his possessions in [[Duchy of Holstein|Holstein]], decided to intervene in the conflict raging in northern Germany. The campaign [[Battle of Wolgast|ended in defeat]], and Jutland was occupied by the imperial army of [[Albrecht von Wallenstein]]. In the [[Treaty of L\u00fcbeck]], Christian made peace and agreed to not intervene in Germany again. The war in Germany had been very expensive and [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] saw no other recourse than to raise the Sound tolls. Unfortunately, this act pushed the [[Netherlands]] away from Denmark and into the arms of Sweden.\n\n==== Torstenson War (1643\u20131645)====\n[[File:Danmark f\u00f8r 1645.png|thumb|Denmark before 1645]]\nIn 1643, Sweden's armies, under the command of [[Lennart Torstensson]], suddenly invaded Denmark without declaring war. The ensuing conflict became known as the [[Torstenson War]]. The [[Netherlands]], wishing to end the Danish stranglehold on the Baltic, joined the Swedes in their war against [[Denmark\u2013Norway]]. In October 1644, a combined Dutch-Swedish fleet destroyed 80 percent of the Danish fleet in the Battle of Femern. The result of this defeat proved disastrous for [[Denmark\u2013Norway]]: in the [[Second treaty of Br\u00f6msebro (1645)]] Denmark ceded to Sweden the Norwegian provinces [[Jemtland]], [[Herjedalen]] and [[\u00c4lvdalen Municipality|\u00c4lvdalen]] as well as the Danish islands of [[Gotland]] and [[Saaremaa|\u00d8sel]]. [[Halland]] went to Sweden for a period of 30 years and the [[Netherlands]] were exempted from paying the Sound Duty.\n\n[[File:Danmark f\u00f8r 1658.png|thumb|Denmark before 1658]]\n[[File:Scandinavia 1658.gif|thumb|right|'''Treaty of Roskilde, 1658'''.<br />{{legend|#FF0000|Halland, previously occupied by Sweden for a 30-year period under the terms of the Peace of Br\u00f6msebro negotiated in 1645, was now ceded}}\n{{legend|#FFFF00|the Scanian lands and Bohus County were ceded}}\n{{legend|#B404AE|Tr\u00f8ndelag and Bornholm provinces, which were ceded in 1658, but rebelled against Sweden and returned to Danish rule in [[Treaty of Copenhagen (1660)|1660]].}}]]\n\nNevertheless, Danes remember Christian IV as one of the great kings of Denmark. He had a very long reign, from 1588 to 1648, and has become known as \"the architect on the Danish throne\" because of the large number of building [[project]]s he undertook. Many of the great buildings of Denmark date from his reign. After the death of Christian IV in 1648, his son Frederick succeeded him.\n\n==== Second Northern War (1655\u20131660) ====\nIn 1657, during the [[Second Northern War]], [[Denmark\u2013Norway]] launched a war of revenge against Sweden (then distracted in Poland) which turned into a complete disaster. The war became a disaster for two reasons: Primarily, because Denmark's new powerful ally, the [[Netherlands]], remained neutral as Denmark was the aggressor and Sweden the defender. Secondly, the [[Great Belt|Belts]] froze over in a rare occurrence during the winter of 1657\u20131658, allowing [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden]] to [[March across the Belts|lead his armies across the ice]] to invade [[Zealand]].\n\nIn the following [[Treaty of Roskilde]], [[Denmark\u2013Norway]] capitulated and gave up all of [[Terra Scania|Eastern Denmark]] (Danish: Sk\u00e5ne, Halland, Blekinge and [[Bornholm]]), in addition to the counties of [[Bahusia]] (Norwegian: B\u00e5huslen) and [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]] in Norway. [[Holstein-Gottorp]] was also tied to Sweden, providing a gateway for future invasions from the south.\n\nBut the Second Northern War was not yet over. Three months after the peace treaty was signed, [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden]] held a council of war where he decided to simply wipe Denmark from the map and unite all of Scandinavia under his rule. Once again the Swedish army arrived outside Copenhagen. However, this time the Danes did not panic or surrender. Instead, they decided to fight and prepared to defend Copenhagen.\n\n[[File:T\u00e5get \u00f6ver b\u00e4lt2.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[March across the Belts]] in 1658]]\n[[Frederick III of Denmark]] had stayed in his capital and now encouraged the citizens of Copenhagen to resist the Swedes, by saying he would die in his nest. Furthermore, this unprovoked declaration of war by Sweden finally triggered the alliance that [[Denmark\u2013Norway]] had with the [[Netherlands]]. A powerful Dutch fleet was sent to Copenhagen with vital supplies and reinforcements, which saved the city from being captured during the [[Assault on Copenhagen|Swedish attack]]. Furthermore, [[Brandenburg-Prussia]], the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and the [[Habsburg monarchy]] had gathered large forces to aid [[Denmark\u2013Norway]] and fighting continued into 1659. \n[[File:Battle in k\u00f8ge bay-claus moinichen 1686.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Battle of K\u00f8ge Bay (1677)|Battle of K\u00f8ge Bay]] in 1677]]\n\n[[Charles X Gustav of Sweden]] suddenly died of an illness in early 1660, while planning an invasion of Norway. Following his death, Sweden made peace in the [[Treaty of Copenhagen (1660)|Treaty of Copenhagen]]. The Swedes returned [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]] to Norway and [[Bornholm]] to Denmark, but kept both [[Bahusia]] and [[Terra Scania]]. The [[Netherlands]] and other European powers accepted the settlement, not wanting both coasts of the Sound controlled by Denmark. This treaty established the boundaries between Norway, Denmark, and Sweden that still exist today. All in all, Sweden had now surpassed Denmark as the most powerful country in Scandinavia.\n\n=== Absolutism ===\n\nAs a result of the disaster in the war against Sweden, [[Frederick III of Denmark|King Frederick III]] (reigned 1648\u20131670) succeeded in convincing the nobles to give up some of their powers and their exemption from taxes, leading to the era of [[political absolutism|absolutism]] in Denmark. The country's main objective in the following decades was the recovery of its lost provinces from Sweden. In the 1670s, [[Denmark\u2013Norway]] had regained enough strength to start [[Scanian War|a war with Sweden to recover its lost provinces]]. However, in spite of Denmark's outside support, naval dominance and initial support from the population of [[Terra Scania|the former eastern provinces]], the war ended in a bitter [[Peace of Lund|stalemate]].\n\n==== Great Northern War (1700\u20131721) ====\nA renewed attack during the [[Great Northern War|Third Northern War]] (1700\u20131721) first resulted in the unfavourable [[Peace of Travendal]], but after Denmark's re-entry into the war and Sweden's ultimate defeat by a large alliance, Sweden was no longer a threat to Denmark. However, the great powers opposed any Danish territorial gains, which meant the [[Treaty of Frederiksborg]] did not return the former eastern provinces to Denmark. Furthermore, Denmark was even forced to return [[Swedish Pomerania]], [[Siege of Stralsund (1711\u20131715)|held by Danish forces since 1715]], to Sweden. Denmark now had no hope of recovering its lost provinces from Sweden. As noted earlier, the rest of Europe was simply against the Sound being controlled by a single nation ever again.\n\nFor most of the 18th century, Denmark was at peace. The only time when war threatened was in 1762, when the [[Duke of Holstein-Gottorp]] became Tsar [[Peter III of Russia]] and declared war on Denmark over his ancestral claims in [[Schleswig]]. Before any fighting could begin, however, he was overthrown by his wife, who took control of Russia as Tsarina [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] (Catherine the Great).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Elements of General History, Ancient and Modern|first=Lord Alexander Fraser|last=Tytler Woodhouselee|authorlink=Alexander Fraser Tytler, Lord Woodhouselee|pages=[https://archive.org/details/elementsofgenera02wood/page/428 428]\u2013429|year=1823|publisher=H. Hill|url=https://archive.org/details/elementsofgenera02wood|accessdate=4 November 2016}}</ref> Empress Catherine withdrew her husband's demands and negotiated the transfer of ducal [[Schleswig-Holstein]] to the Danish crown in return for Russian control of the [[County of Oldenburg]] and adjacent lands within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], an exchange that was formalized with the 1773 [[Treaty of Tsarskoye Selo]]. The alliance that accompanied the territorial exchange tied Denmark's foreign policy to Russia's and led directly to Denmark's involvement in a series of wars over the succeeding decades.\n\nWith the suspension of the Danish [[diet (assembly)|diet]], that body disappeared for a couple of centuries. During this time power became increasingly centralized in Copenhagen. Frederick's government reorganized itself in a much more hierarchical manner, built around the king as a focal point of administration. Crown officials dominated the administration, as well as a new group of bureaucrats, much to the dismay of the traditional aristocracy, who saw their own influence curtailed even further. The absolutist kings of Denmark were quite weak compared to their Swedish counterparts, and non-noble landlords became the real rulers of the country. They used their influence to pass laws that favored themselves.\n\nThe administration and laws underwent \"modernization\" during this period. In 1683, the ''Danske lov 1683'' ([[Danish Code]]) standardized and collected all the old provincial laws. Other initiatives included the standardization of all [[weights and measures]] throughout the kingdom, and an agricultural survey and registry. This survey allowed the government to begin taxing landowners directly, moving it beyond dependence on revenue from [[crown land]]s.\n\nThe population of Denmark rose steadily through this period, from 600,000 in 1660 (after the loss of territory to Sweden) to 700,000 in 1720. By 1807, it had risen to 978,000.\n\n==== Changes in the agricultural economy ====\nAttempts to diversify the economy away from agriculture failed. During this period, little industry existed, except for a very small amount in Copenhagen (population: 30,000). In the late 17th century a small amount of industry did develop, catering to the military. Denmark suffered in part because of its lack of natural resources. It had nothing much to export except agricultural products. The Netherlands bought the largest share of Denmark's exports. The landlords, only about 300 in number, nevertheless owned 90% of the land in the country.\n\nRural administration remained primarily the preserve of the large landholders and of a few law-enforcement officials. In 1733, low crop prices caused the introduction of [[adscription]], an effort by the landlords to obtain cheap labor. The effect of this was to turn the previously free Danish peasantry into serfs. The adscription system tied rural laborers to their place of birth and required them to rent farms on the estates.\n\nAs rent, peasants were required to work the landlords' plots and could not negotiate contracts or demand payment for improvements made to the farm. Peasants who refused to rent a farm were subject to six years of military service. Danish agriculture was very inefficient and unproductive as a result, since the peasants had no motivation to perform anything more than the absolute minimum of work. Attempts to sell Danish grain in Norway failed because of its low quality compared to grain from the Baltic.\n\nIn the late 18th century, extensive agricultural reforms took place, involving the abolition of the old [[Open field system|open-field system]] and the amalgamation of many smaller farms into larger ones. With the abolition of the adscription system, the military could now only obtain manpower through conscription. These reforms were possible because agricultural prices steadily rose in the second half of the century.\n\nThroughout the 18th century, the Danish economy did very well, largely on the basis of expanded agricultural output to meet growing demand across Europe. Danish merchant ships also traded around Europe and the North Atlantic, venturing to new [[Danish colonization of the Americas|Danish colonies]] in the Caribbean and North Atlantic.\n\n==== The Enlightenment and Danish nationalism ====\n[[Image:Forrige Grev Iohan Frid. Struensee og Grev Enevold Brandt forreffillet og afbildet po hiul og Steyler d. 28 Aprill 1772.jpg|thumb|180px|Denmark's social reformers [[Johann Friedrich Struensee|Struensee]] and [[Enevold Brandt|Brandt]] quartered and displayed on the wheel on 28 April 1772]]\nNew propriety and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas became popular among the [[middle class]]es of Denmark, arousing increased interest in [[personal liberty]]. In the last 15 years of the 18th century, the authorities relaxed the censorship which had existed since the beginning of the 17th century. At the same time, a sense of Danish nationalism began to develop. Hostility increased against Germans and Norwegians present at the royal court. Pride in the Danish language and culture increased, and eventually a law banned \"foreigners\" from holding posts in the government. Antagonism between Germans and Danes increased from the mid-18th century on.\n\nIn the 1770s, during the reign of the mentally unstable Christian VII (1766\u20131808), the queen's lover, a German doctor named [[Johann Friedrich Struensee]], became the real ruler of the country. Filled with the ideas of the Enlightenment, he attempted a number of radical reforms including freedom of the press and religion. But it was short-lived. The landlords feared that the reforms were a threat to their power, while the commoners believed that religious freedom was an invitation to atheism.\n\nIn 1772, Struensee was arrested, tried, and convicted of crimes against the majesty, his right hand was cut off following his beheading, his remains were quartered and put on display on top of spikes on the commons west of Copenhagen. The next 12 years were a period of unmitigated reaction until a group of reformers gained power in 1784.\n\n=====Reforms=====\nDenmark became the model of enlightened despotism, partially influenced by the ideas of the French Revolution. Denmark thus adopted liberalizing reforms in line with those of the French Revolution, with no direct contact. Danes were aware of French ideas and agreed with them, as it moved from Danish absolutism to a liberal constitutional system between 1750\u20131850. The change of government in 1784 was caused by a power vacuum created when King Christian VII took ill, and influence shifted to the crown prince (who later became King Frederick VI) and reform-oriented landowners. Between 1784 and 1815, the abolition of [[serfdom]] made the majority of the peasants into landowners. The government also introduced [[free trade]] and [[universal education]]. In contrast to France under the '''ancien regime''', agricultural reform was intensified in Denmark, civil rights were extended to the peasants, the finances of the Danish state were healthy, and there were no external or internal crises. That is, reform was gradual and the regime itself carried out agrarian reforms that had the effect of weakening absolutism by creating a class of independent peasant freeholders. Much of the initiative came from well-organized liberals who directed political change in the first half of the 19th century.<ref>Henrik Horstboll, and Uffe Osterg\u00e5rd, \"Reform and Revolution: The French Revolution and the Case of Denmark, ''Scandinavian Journal of History'' (1990) 15#3 pp 155-179</ref>\n\n=====Newspapers=====\nDanish news media first appeared in the 1540s, when handwritten fly sheets reported on the news. In 1666, [[Anders Bording]], the father of Danish journalism, began a state paper. The royal privilege to bring out a newspaper was issued to Joachim Wielandt in 1720. University officials handled the censorship, but in 1770 Denmark became one of the first nations of the world to provide for press freedom; it ended in 1799. In 1795\u20131814, the press, led by intellectuals and civil servants, called out for a more just and modern society, and spoke out for the oppressed tenant farmers against the power of the old aristocracy.<ref>Thorkild Kj\u00e6rgaard, \"The rise of press and public opinion in eighteenth\u2010century Denmark\u2014Norway.\" ''Scandinavian journal of History'' 14.4 (1989): 215-230. He stresses the role</ref>\n\nIn 1834, the first liberal newspaper appeared, one that gave much more emphasis to actual news content rather than opinions. The newspapers championed the Revolution of 1848 in Denmark. The new constitution of 1849 liberated the Danish press. Newspapers flourished in the second half of the 19th century, usually tied to one or another political party or labor union. Modernization, bringing in new features and mechanical techniques, appeared after 1900. The total circulation was 500,000 daily in 1901, more than doubling to 1.2 million in 1925. The German occupation brought informal censorship; some offending newspaper buildings were simply blown up by the Nazis. During the war, the underground produced 550 newspapers\u2014small, surreptitiously printed sheets that encouraged sabotage and resistance.<ref>Kenneth E. Olson, ''The history makers: The press of Europe from its beginnings through 1965'' (LSU Press, 1966) pp 50 \u2013 64, 433</ref>\n\n=== Colonial ventures ===\n\n{{main|Danish colonization of the Americas|Danish colonial empire}}\n\n[[Image:Denmark-Norway and possessions.png|right|300px|thumb|Map showing Denmark\u2013Norway and its colonial possessions c. 1800]]\n\nDenmark maintained a number of [[colonies]] outside Scandinavia, starting in the 17th century and lasting until the 20th century. Denmark also controlled traditional colonies{{citation needed|reason=Greenland and Iceland where part of the Kingdom and did not have colonial status.|date=October 2016}} in Greenland and Iceland in the north Atlantic, obtained through the union with Norway. [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] (reigned 1588\u20131648) first initiated the policy of expanding Denmark's overseas trade, as part of the [[mercantilist]] trend then popular in European governing circles. Denmark established its own first colony at [[Tranquebar]], or Trankebar, on India's south coast, in 1620.\n\nIn the [[Caribbean]] Denmark started a colony on [[Saint Thomas, United States Virgin Islands|St Thomas]] in 1671, [[Saint John, United States Virgin Islands|St John]] in 1718, and purchased [[Saint Croix]] from [[France]] in 1733. Denmark maintained its Indian colony, Tranquebar, as well as several other smaller colonies there, for about two hundred years. The [[Danish East India Company]] operated out of Tranquebar.\n\nDuring its heyday, the Danish East Indian Company and the [[Swedish East India Company]] imported more tea than the [[British East India Company]] \u2014 and smuggled 90% of it into Britain, where it sold at a huge profit. Both of the Scandinavia-based East India Companies folded during the course of the Napoleonic Wars. Denmark also maintained other colonies, forts, and bases in West Africa, primarily for the purpose of [[Slavery|slave]]-trading.\n\n== 19th century ==\n{{anchor|The 19th century}}\n{{see|Danish Golden Age}}\n\n=== The Napoleonic Wars ===\n\n[[Image:Slaget p\u00e5 reden.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The Battle of Copenhagen, 1801.]]\n\nThe long decades of peace came to an abrupt end during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Britain felt threatened by the Armed Neutrality Treaty of 1794, which originally involved Denmark and Sweden, and later Prussia and Russia. The [[Royal Navy|British fleet]] [[Battle of Copenhagen (1801)|attacked Copenhagen]] in 1801, destroying much of Denmark's navy. Denmark nonetheless managed to remain largely uninvolved in the Napoleonic Wars until 1807. The British [[Naval fleet|fleet]] [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|bombarded Copenhagen]] again that year, causing considerable destruction to the city. They then captured the entire Danish fleet so that it could not be used by France to invade Britain (as the French had lost their own fleet at Trafalgar in 1805), leading to the [[Gunboat War]] (1807\u20131814). The confiscation of the Danish navy was widely criticised in Britain.\n\nIn 1809 Danish forces fighting on the French side participated in defeating the anti-Bonapartist German rebellion led by [[Ferdinand von Schill]], at the [[Battle of Stralsund (1809)|Battle of Stralsund]]. By 1813, Denmark could no longer bear the war costs, and the [[National bankruptcy|state was bankrupt]]. When in the same year the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|Sixth Coalition]] isolated Denmark by clearing Northern Germany of French forces, [[Frederick VI of Denmark|Frederick VI]] had to make peace. Accordingly, the unfavourable [[Treaty of Kiel]] was concluded in January 1814 with Sweden and Great Britain, and another peace was signed with Russia in February.\n\nThe post-Napoleonic [[Congress of Vienna]] demanded the dissolution of the Dano-Norwegian union, and this was confirmed by the [[Treaty of Kiel]] in 1814. The treaty transferred [[Heligoland]] to Great Britain and [[Norway]] from the Danish to the Swedish crown, Denmark was to be satisfied with [[Swedish Pomerania]]. But the [[Norway in 1814|Norwegians revolted]], declared their independence, and elected crown-prince Christian Frederick (the future [[Christian VIII of Denmark|Christian VIII]]) as their king. However, the Norwegian independence movement failed to attract any support from the European powers. After a brief war with Sweden, Christian had to abdicate in order to preserve Norwegian autonomy, established in a [[personal union]] with Sweden. In favour of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], Denmark renounced her claims to Swedish Pomerania at the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1815), and instead was satisfied with the [[Duchy of Lauenburg]] and a Prussian payment of 3.5 million talers. Prussia also took over a Danish 600,000-taler debt to Sweden.\n\nThis period also counts as \"the Golden Age\" of Danish [[intellectual history]]. A sign of renewed intellectual vigor was the introduction of compulsory schooling in 1814. Literature, painting, sculpture, and philosophy all experienced an unusually vibrant period. The stories of [[Hans Christian Andersen]] (1805\u20131875) became popular not only in Denmark, but all over Europe and in the United States.<ref>{{cite book |title=Hans Christian Andersen: Danish Writer and Citizen of the World | editor=Sven Hakon Rossel |year=1996 |publisher=Rodopi |isbn= |pages=52\u201354 }}</ref> The ideas of the philosopher [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]] (1813\u20131855) spread far beyond Denmark, influencing not only his own era, but proving instrumental in the development of new philosophical systems after him. The sculptures of [[Bertel Thorvaldsen|Thorvaldsen]] (1770\u20131834) grace public buildings all over Denmark and other artists appreciated and copied his style. [[N. F. S. Grundtvig|Grundtvig]] (1783\u20131872) tried to reinvigorate the Danish National Church and contributed to the hymns used by the church in Denmark.\n\n=== Nationalism and liberalism ===\n{{see also|History of Schleswig-Holstein}}\n[[File:Grundlovgivende rigsforsamling - Constantin Hansen.jpg|thumb|''Den Grundlovgivende Rigsforsamling''<br /> The Constitutional Assembly created The [[Constitution of Denmark|Danish constitution]], 1860\u20131864 painting by [[Constantin Hansen]].]]\nThe Danish [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[nationalism|national]] movements gained momentum in the 1830s, and after the European revolutions of 1848 Denmark became a [[constitutional monarchy]] on 5 June 1849. The growing [[bourgeoisie]] had demanded a share in government, and in an attempt to avert the sort of bloody revolution occurring elsewhere in Europe, [[Frederick VII of Denmark|Frederick VII]] gave in to the demands of the citizens. A new constitution emerged, [[Separation of powers|separating the powers]] and granting the [[suffrage|franchise]] to all adult males, as well as freedom of the press, religion, and association. The king became head of the [[executive branch]]. The [[legislative branch]] consisted of two parliamentary chambers; the [[Folketing]], comprising members elected by the general population, and the [[Landsting (Denmark)|Landsting]], elected by landowners. Denmark also gained an independent [[judiciary]].\n\nAnother significant result of the revolution was the [[abolitionism|abolition of slavery]] in the [[Danish West Indies]], the Danish colony in the Caribbean, which at an earlier part of its history witnessed the biggest slave auctions in the world.<ref>Neville A.T. Hall, and B. W. Higman, ''Slave Society in the Danish West Indies: St. Thomas, St. John, and St. Croix'' (Aarhus Universitetsforlag, 1992).</ref> In 1845 Denmark's other tropical colony, [[Tranquebar]] in India, was sold to Britain.\n\nThe Danish king's realm still consisted of the islands, the northern half of the [[Jutland]] peninsula, and the [[Duchy of Schleswig]] in [[real union]] with the [[Duchy of Holstein]].\n\n[[File:F\u00f8rste Infanteriregiment i Haandgem\u00e6ng med Regimentet Martini.png|thumb|left|Danish Infantry regiment in a fight with regiment \"Martini\". Contemporary illustration of the 1864 [[Second Schleswig War]].]]\nThe islands and Jutland together constituted the kingdom, whereas the monarch held the duchies in [[personal union]] with the kingdom. The duchy of Schleswig constituted a Danish [[fief]], while the Duchy of Holstein remained a part of the [[German Confederation]].\n\nSince the early 18th century, and even more so from the early 19th century, the Danes had become used to viewing the duchies and the kingdom as increasingly unified in one [[Sovereign state|state]]. This view, however, clashed with that of the German majority in the duchies, also enthused by liberal and national trends, which led to a movement known as Schleswig-Holsteinism. Schleswig-Holsteinists aimed for independence from Denmark. The [[First Schleswig War]] (1848\u20131851) broke out after constitutional change in 1849 and ended with the ''status quo'' because of the intervention of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and other Great Powers.\n\nMuch debate took place in Denmark as to how to deal with the question of Schleswig-Holstein. National-Liberals demanded permanent ties between Schleswig and Denmark, but stated that Holstein could do as it pleased. However, international events overtook domestic Danish politics, and Denmark faced war against both [[Prussia]] and [[Austria]] in what became known as the [[Second Schleswig War]] (1864). The war lasted from February to October 1864. Denmark was easily beaten by Prussia and Austria, and obliged to relinquish both Schleswig and Holstein.\n\nThe war caused Denmark as a nation severe trauma, forcing it to reconsider its place in the world. The loss of Schleswig-Holstein came as the latest in the long series of defeats and territorial loss that had begun in the 17th century. The Danish state had now lost some of the richest areas of the kingdom: Sk\u00e5ne to Sweden and Schleswig to Germany, so the nation focused on developing the poorer areas of the country. Extensive agricultural improvements took place in Jutland, and a new form of nationalism, which emphasized the \"small\" people, the decency of rural Denmark, and the shunning of wider aspirations, developed.\n\n=== Industrialisation ===\n[[Industrialisation]] came to Denmark in the second half of the 19th century. The nation's first railroads were constructed in the 1850s, and improved communications and overseas trade allowed industry to develop in spite of Denmark's lack of natural resources. Trade unions developed starting in the 1870s. There was a considerable migration of people from the countryside to the cities, and Danish agriculture became centered around the export of dairy and meat products.\n\nThe two concepts of internationalism and nationalism have become very much part of the history of the Danish [[Labour movement]].\n\nThe Labour movement gathered momentum when social issues became associated with internationalism. Socialist theory and organisational contact with the [[International Workingmen's Association|First International]], which linked labour movements in various countries, paved the way. [[Louis Pio]] emerged as the driving force. In 1871, following the bloody defeat of the [[Paris Commune]], he started publishing socialist journalism. He campaigned strongly for an independent organisation of the workers under their own management, and organised a Danish branch of the First International. This became the foundation stone for the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democratic Party]] under the name of ''Den Internationale Arbejderforening for Danmark'' (The International Labour Association for Denmark). As a combination of union and political party, it adroitly brought together national and international elements.\n\nPio saw internationalism as vital for the success of the workers' struggle: without internationalism, no progress. He pointed out that the middle classes cooperated across national frontiers and used nationalistic rhetoric as a weapon against the workers and their liberation.\n\nThe Danish section started organising strikes and demonstrations for higher wages and social reforms. Demands were moderate, but enough to provoke the employers and the forces of [[Law and order (politics)|law and order]]. Things came to a head in the Battle of [[F\u00e6lledparken|F\u00e6lleden]] on 5 May 1872. The authorities arrested the three leaders, Louis Pio, [[Poul Geleff]] and Harald Brix, charged them and convicted them of high treason. The three left Denmark for the United States to set up the ill-starred and short-lived socialist colony near Hays City, in [[Ellis County, Kansas]].\n\nBack in Denmark, the emerging political situation made possible by the new Danish door of independence alarmed many of the existing elites, since it inevitably [[empowerment|empowered]] the peasantry. Simple men with little education replaced professors and professionals in positions of power. The peasants, in coalition with liberal and radical elements from the cities, eventually won a majority of seats in the Folketing. Even though constitutional changes had taken place to boost the power of the Landsting, the Left ''[[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]]'' Party demanded to form the government, but the king, still the head of the executive branch, refused. However, in 1901, king [[Christian IX of Denmark|Christian IX]] gave in and asked [[Johan Henrik Deuntzer]], a member of Venstre, to form a government, the [[Cabinet of Deuntzer]]. This began a tradition of [[parliamentary government]], and with the exception of the [[Easter Crisis of 1920]], no government since 1901 has ruled against a parliamentary majority in the Folketing.\n\n=== Monetary union ===\n{{main|Scandinavian Monetary Union}}\n[[File:Two 20kr gold coins.png|thumb|right|Two golden 20 kr coins from the Scandinavian Monetary Union, which was based on a [[gold standard]]. The coin to the left is Swedish and the right one is Danish.]]\n\nThe [[Scandinavian Monetary Union]], a [[monetary union]] formed by Sweden and Denmark on 5 May 1873, fixed both their [[currency|currencies]] against [[gold standard|gold]] [[Par value|at par]] to each other. [[Norway]], governed in union with Sweden, entered the monetary union two years later in 1875 by pegging its currency to gold at the same level as Denmark and Sweden (.403&nbsp;gram).<ref>[http://www.nationalbanken.dk/dnuk/hist.nsf/side/From_silver_standard_to_gold_standard From silver standard to gold standard] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103214722/http://www.nationalbanken.dk/dnuk/hist.nsf/side/From_silver_standard_to_gold_standard |date=2013-11-03 }}, retrieved 2008-08-05</ref> The monetary union proved one of the few tangible results of the [[Scandinavist]] political movement of the 19th century.\n\nThe union provided fixed exchange-rates and stability in monetary terms, but the member-countries continued to issue their own separate currencies. In an outcome not initially foreseen, the perceived security led to a situation where the formally separate currencies circulated on a basis of \"as good as\" the [[legal tender]] virtually throughout the entire area.\n\nThe outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914 brought an end to the monetary union. Sweden abandoned the tie to gold on 2 August 1914, and without a fixed exchange rate the free circulation came to an end.\n\n== 20th century ==\n\n=== 1901\u20131939 ===\nIn the early decades of the 20th century the new [[Det Radikale Venstre|Radical Party]] and the older [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre Party]] shared government. During this time women gained the [[Women's suffrage|right to vote]] (1915), and the United States purchased some of Denmark's colonial holdings: the three islands of [[Saint John, United States Virgin Islands|St. John]], [[St. Croix]], and [[Saint Thomas, United States Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]] in the [[West Indies]]. The period also saw Denmark inaugurating important social and labour-market reforms, laying the basis for the {{As of|2008|alt=present}} [[welfare state]].\n\nDenmark remained [[Neutral country|neutral]] during [[World War I]], but the conflict affected the country to a considerable extent. As its economy was heavily based on exports, the unrestricted German submarine warfare was a serious problem. Denmark had no choice but to sell many of its exports to Germany instead of overseas nations. Widespread [[war profiteer|profiteering]] took place, but commerce also suffered great disruption because of the conflict and because of the ensuing financial instability in Europe. Rationing was instituted, and there were food and fuel shortages. In addition, Denmark was forced by Berlin to mine the Sound to prevent British ships from entering it. Following the defeat of Germany in the war (1918), the [[Treaty of Versailles]] (1919) mandated the [[Schleswig Plebiscites]], which resulted in the return of [[Northern Schleswig]] ({{As of|2008|alt=now}} [[Southern Jutland|South Jutland]]) to Denmark. The king and parts of the opposition grumbled that Prime Minister [[Carl Theodor Zahle]] (in office 1909\u20131910 and 1913\u20131920) did not use Germany's defeat to take back a bigger portion of the province, which Denmark had lost in the [[Second Schleswig War]] in 1864. The king and the opposition wanted to take over the city of [[Flensburg]], while the cabinet insisted on only claiming areas where a majority of Danes lived, which led to a plebiscite in the affected areas over whether they wanted to become a part of [[Denmark]] or remain within [[Germany]]. Believing that he had the support of the people, King Christian X used his [[reserve power]] to dismiss Zahle's cabinet, sparking the [[Easter Crisis of 1920]]. As a result of the Easter Crisis, the king promised to no longer interfere in politics. Although the [[Danish Constitution]] was not amended at that time, Danish monarchs have stayed out of politics since then. The end of the war also prompted the Danish government to finish negotiating with [[Iceland]], resulting in Iceland becoming a sovereign [[Kingdom of Iceland|Kingdom]] on 1 December 1918 while retaining the Danish monarch as [[head of state]].\n\nIn the [[1924 Danish Folketing election|1924 Folketing election]] the [[Social Democrat]]s, under the charismatic [[Thorvald Stauning]], became Denmark's largest parliamentary political party, a position they maintained until 2001. Since the opposition still held a majority of the seats in the [[Landsting (Denmark)|Landsting]], Stauning had to co-operate with some of the right-wing parties, making the Social Democrats a more mainstream party. He succeeded in brokering an important deal in the 1930s which brought an end to the [[Great Depression]] in Denmark, and also laid the foundation for a welfare state.\n\nDenmark joined the [[League of Nations]] in 1920 and during the interwar period was active in promoting peaceful solutions to international issues. With the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]] in Germany during the 1930s, the country found itself in a very precarious situation. Berlin refused to recognize its post-1920 border with Denmark, however the Nazi regime was preoccupied with more important matters and did not make any issue of it. The Danes tried unsuccessfully to obtain recognition of the border from their neighbor, but otherwise went out of their way to avoid antagonizing Germany.\n\n=== Second World War ===\n{{main|Occupation of Denmark}}\n[[Image:Christian X.jpg|left|thumb|During the German occupation, King Christian X became a powerful symbol of national sovereignty. This image dates from the King's birthday, 26 September 1940. Note the lack of a guard.]]\n\nIn 1939, Hitler offered nonaggression pacts to the Scandinavian nations. While Sweden and Norway refused, Denmark readily accepted. When WWII began that fall, Copenhagen declared its neutrality. Nevertheless, Germany (so as to secure communications for its invasion of Norway) occupied Denmark on April 9, 1940, meeting limited resistance. British forces, however, [[British occupation of the Faroe Islands in World War II|occupied]] the [[Faroe Islands]] (12 April 1940) and [[Invasion of Iceland|invaded]] [[Iceland]] (10 May 1940) in pre-emptive moves to prevent German occupation. Following a [[1944 Icelandic referendum|plebiscite]], Iceland declared its independence on June 17, 1944 and became a republic, dissolving its union with Denmark.\n\nThe Nazi occupation of Denmark unfolded in a unique manner. The Monarchy remained. The conditions of occupation started off very leniently (although the authorities banned [[Communist Party of Denmark|Danmarks Kommunistiske Parti]] (the Communist party) when the Wehrmacht [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]] in June 1941), and Denmark retained its own government. The new coalition government tried to protect the population from Nazi rule through compromise. The Germans allowed the Folketing to remain in session. Despite [[Deportation of the Danish police|deportations of nearly 2,000 of its members]], the police remained largely under Danish control, and the German authorities stayed one step removed from the population. However, the Nazi demands eventually became intolerable for the Danish government, so, in 1943, it resigned and Germany assumed full control of Denmark. From that point, an armed resistance movement grew against the occupying forces. Towards the end of the war, Denmark grew increasingly difficult for Germany to control, but the country remained under occupation until near the end of the war. On 4 May 1945, German forces in Denmark, North West Germany, and the Netherlands surrendered to the Allies. On 5 May 1945, British troops liberated Copenhagen. Three days later, the war ended.\n\nDenmark succeeded in smuggling most of its Jewish population to Sweden, in 1943, when the Nazis threatened deportation; see [[Rescue of the Danish Jews]]. Danish doctors refused to treat German citizens fleeing from Germany. Some 13,000 died in 1945 from various causes.<ref>Manfred Ertel.

Denmark had originally tried to form an alliance with Norway and Sweden only, but this attempt had failed. A [[Nordic Council]] later emerged however, with the aim of co-ordinating Nordic policies. Later on, in a [[1972 Danish European Communities membership referendum|referendum in 1972]], Danes voted in favour of joining the [[European Community]], the predecessor of the [[European Union]], and Denmark became a member on 1 January 1973. Since then, Denmark has proven a hesitant member of the European community, opting out of many proposals, including the [[Euro]], which the country rejected in a [[2000 Danish euro referendum|referendum in 2000]].\n\n== 21st century ==\n[[File:President George W.

On behalf of all [[Scandinavia]]ns.\n\nVenstre leader [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]] won the [[2001 Danish general election|2001]], [[2005 Danish general election|2005]], and [[2007 Danish general election|2007 Folketing election]]s and formed a new government and was in his first few months challenged after the Social Democrat Prime Minister [[Poul Nyrup Rasmussen]] admitted defeat. Eight years later, he resigned from his office in April 2009 due to upcoming as the [[Secretary General of NATO|NATO Secretary-General]], and then [[Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen]] will be sworn in as Prime Minister in his first term from 2009 to 2011.\n\nIn the [[2011 Danish general election|2011 Folketing elections]], the incumbent centre-right coalition led by Venstre lost power to a centre-left coalition led by the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] making [[Helle Thorning-Schmidt]], the country's first female Prime Minister. The Social Liberal Party and the Socialist People's Party became part of the three-party government. The new parliament convened on 4 October 2011.\n\nIn 2015, Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen won the [[2015 Danish general election|Folketing election]] and formed a new twice government and was in his second office. Although the ruling [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] became the largest party in the Folketing and increased their seat count, the opposition [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre party]] was able to form a minority government headed by [[Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen]] with the support of the [[Danish People's Party]], the [[Liberal Alliance (Denmark)|Liberal Alliance]] and the [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party]].\n\nIn the [[2019 Danish general election|2019 Folkeing election]], comprising parties that supported the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]]' leader [[Mette Frederiksen]] as candidate for Prime Minister.

Meanwhile, the incumbent governing coalition, consisting of [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]], the [[Liberal Alliance (Denmark)|Liberal Alliance]] and the [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party]] whilst receiving outside parliamentary support from the [[Danish People's Party]] and [[Nunatta Qitornai]], was reduced to 76 seats (including the [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]]-affiliated [[Union Party (Faroe Islands)|Union Party]] in the [[Faroe Islands]]).\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Denmark|Faroe Islands|History}}\n* [[List of Danish monarchs]]\n** [[Danish monarchs' family tree]]\n* [[List of Danish chronicles]]\n* [[History of Christianity in Denmark]]\n* [[Politics of Denmark]]\n* [[Politics of the Faroe Islands]]\n* [[Politics of Greenland]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{further|History of Scandinavia#Further reading}}\n* Bain [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=Obs0AAAAQBAJ online]\n*Derry, T.

They are accompanied by Eug\u00e9nie's father Baron Hartley, who believes they're in town on business. In fact, Eug\u00e9nie has secretly married The Earl of Clarendon and has come to visit him; they are staying in the Earl's ''petite maison'', near his palace. Eug\u00e9nie is dismayed that the Earl has gone out of town despite knowing about their plans to visit. Madame Murer\u2014who is the only member of Eug\u00e9nie's family that knows about the wedding\u2014tries to reassure Eug\u00e9nie that noblemen like the Earl simply have busy schedules. (It's of note that the script frequently indicates that Eug\u00e9nie's father, the Baron, is not a nobleman.) Eug\u00e9nie is even more concerned because she is already pregnant, and still hasn't told her father about her marriage, due to the insistence of Madame Murer and the Earl that it should be kept a secret. The Baron has even started to prepare an arranged marriage for her to someone else\u2014an old military man by the name of Cowerly.\n\nEventually the Earl arrives to visit Eug\u00e9nie. His valet, Drink, prepares to announce him, but chides his master: Drink knows that the Earl's marriage to Eug\u00e9nie was not valid and in fact was completely staged. Furthermore, the Earl is preparing to marry someone else very soon. The Earl complains that another of his servants, his Steward who had pretended to be the minister at his fraudulent wedding, is also feeling regrets and will probably attempt to write to Madame Murer with the truth. He tells Drink to make sure to check any mail that's received at the house and withhold anything that looks like it might be from the Steward. Drink finally leaves to announce the Earl, during which time the Earl admits in monologue that he does truly love Eug\u00e9nie but has been pressured by his uncle to marry someone else; he is so terrified of his uncle and so ashamed of his own behavior that he can't bring himself to confess what he's done.\n\nWhen Eug\u00e9nie and Madame Murer finally greet the Earl, Eug\u00e9nie inquires as to why he has been so distant; the Earl responds with various lies which appease Eug\u00e9nie. The Baron comes in and after meeting the Earl, congratulates him about his upcoming wedding to Lady Winchester, daughter of the Duke of Winchester. Eug\u00e9nie and Madame Murer are horrified at this news, and the flustered Earl quickly lies and assures everyone that the stories of him getting married are just a rumor that's going around. The ladies retire and the two men exit together.\n\n=== Act Two. ===\n\nLater, the Earl sneaks back into the house alone in order to talk with Drink: he instructs Drink to make sure that nobody comes to visit Eug\u00e9nie or her family until after his wedding is concluded, and he specifically warns about the Baron's friend Captain Cowerly (the brother of Eug\u00e9nie's fianc\u00e9 Cowerly.) Meanwhile, Drink has intercepted the letter from the Steward and hidden it. Once the ladies are alone, Drink gives them the remainder of the mail, which includes the news that Eug\u00e9nie's brother Sir Charles, an officer in the army, has been in a duel with his Colonel; the Colonel lost after being disarmed, but is now trying to have Charles assassinated. Eug\u00e9nie worries over her brother and gives the news to her father. Soon afterward Captain Cowerly comes into the house, complaining that the servants were insisting that nobody was home and that he had to barge his way in. After being greeted, Cowerly inquires as to where Sir Charles is at. The Baron and Madame Murer are amazed that he already knows about Sir Charles's troubles, and Cowerly explains that not only has he already spoken with Charles in London, but in fact had assumed that the reason for the family's visit was because Charles was there. Gradually the conversation turns to Earl Clarendon, and Cowerly reveals the family is staying in the Earl's ''petite maison'' (a house where parties and sexual trysts are had) and confirms that the Earl is about to marry someone else. Eug\u00e9nie becomes physically unwell at the news and is taken away by her aunt.\n\n=== Act Three. ===\n\nLater, the Baron goes to comfort Eug\u00e9nie. Eug\u00e9nie decides she should not conceal the truth from her father anymore and admits to him that she has secretly married the Earl. The Baron is outraged by this news; just when he's beginning to calm down, Madame Murer enters and scolds him for his behavior and argues for the merits of the Earl. The Baron, meanwhile, argues that the Earl is a heartless womanizer. When Eug\u00e9nie finally reveals she is already pregnant, the Baron is forced to give his blessing to the marriage; but both he and Eug\u00e9nie remain confused as to why everyone seems to think the Earl is going to marry someone else if he is already married to Eug\u00e9nie. They decide to ask Drink about what's going on. When Drink is called in, the Baron grabs him by the throat and demands answers; Drink is so frightened and confused that he mistakenly thinks they've learned that the marriage between the Earl and Eug\u00e9nie was fraudulent, and winds up delivering to them the letter from the Steward since he believes they already know the contents. Eug\u00e9nie and Madame Murer are horrified when they learn the truth, and the Baron is beside himself with outrage; he claims he will disown Eug\u00e9nie, and storms off. Eug\u00e9nie tearfully asks her aunt that they depart from London, but Madame Murer insists she should meet the Earl one more time\u2014her plan is to call out a minister and to arm the servants, and have essentially a [[shotgun wedding]] for Eug\u00e9nie and the Earl.\n\n=== Act Four. ===\n\nWhen the Earl arrives at Madame Murer's request, he brings along a companion he had rescued from an attack in the street\u2014this man, it turns out, is Eug\u00e9nie's brother Sir Charles. When Madame Murer and the servants try to ambush the Earl, Sir Charles -- feeling indebted for the Earl's help to him -- comes to his defense and allows the Earl to escape; however, Sir Charles indicates that he expects to duel with the Earl later on to settle the matter of Eug\u00e9nie's marriage honorably. Eug\u00e9nie is rendered catatonic by the whole incident and is finally taken away to bed, while Sir Charles swears he will avenge her.\n\n=== Act Five. ===\n\nThe final act occurs very early in the morning; the family has been up all night fretting over Eug\u00e9nie's condition, and they even seem to fear that she may die from grief. She is able to emerge from her room, in a weakened state, to try to convince Sir Charles not to fight the Earl\u2014she insists that she'd rather be known as a \"foresworn wretch\" than to see the Earl harmed. Charles does not listen to her and leaves to fight the Earl: he returns almost immediately, lamenting that when he tried to fight the Earl, his sword shattered and the Earl escaped. Everyone assumes the Earl ran off to go through with this wedding to Lady Winchester. Later, to their surprise, the Earl forces his way into the house and throws himself at Eug\u00e9nie's feet: he declares that he loves her and has done everything in his power to set things right, including admitting to his uncle all that he's done, and calling off the other wedding. Initially Eug\u00e9nie seems to be so near death that she hasn't even heard him, but at last she gathers \"what bits of energy remain\" to reply with a rejection of his offer for marriage: she has been too badly mistreated to ever forgive him. The Earl pleads, and tries to get the Baron or Madame Murer to back him up, but they side with Eug\u00e9nie. At last the Earl delivers a rousing speech in which he argues that, if Eug\u00e9nie won't marry him for her own sake, then at least she should wed him for the sake of their child. This argument moves the Baron and he agrees to grant Eug\u00e9nie to the Earl; at which news Eug\u00e9nie's attitude (and health) do a complete turnaround, and she gladly accepts the Earl's hand.\n\n==References==\nde Beaumarchais, Pierre-Augustin Caron, and Talia Felix. \"Eugenia.\" Createspace, 2011.\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Eugenie}}\n[[Category:1767 plays]]\n[[Category:French plays]]\n[[Category:Plays by Pierre Beaumarchais]]\n", "text_old": "{{italic title}}\n{{refimprove|date=July 2011}}\n[[Image:Eugenie_play.png|thumb|Scene from the final act of ''Eug\u00e9nie''.]]\n'''''Eug\u00e9nie''''' is a play in five acts by [[Pierre Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais]].

He was the founder of the [[Marriott Corporation]] (which became [[Marriott International]] in 1993), the parent company of  the world's largest [[hospitality]], [[hotel chain]]s, and [[food service]]s companies.  The Marriott company rose from a small [[root beer]] stand in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1927 to a chain of family [[restaurant]]s by 1932, to its first motel in 1957. By the time he died, the Marriott company operated 1,400 restaurants and 143 hotels and [[resort]]s worldwide, including two [[Marriott's Great America (disambiguation)|theme parks]], earned [[United States dollar|US$]]4.5 billion in revenue annually with 154,600 employees.

A wide variety of ominous or [[hell]]ish supernatural dogs occur in mythologies around the world. Features that have been attributed to hellhounds include mangled black fur, glowing red eyes, super strength and speed, [[ghost]]ly or phantom characteristics, and a foul odor. \nCertain European legends state that if someone stares into a hellhound's eyes three times or more, that person will surely die. In cultures that associate the afterlife with fire, hellhounds may have fire-based abilities and appearance. They are often assigned to guard the entrances to the [[underworld|world of the dead]], such as graveyards and burial grounds, or undertake other duties related to the [[afterlife]] or the [[supernatural]], such as hunting lost souls or guarding a supernatural treasure. In European legends, seeing a hellhound or hearing it howl may be an omen or even a cause of death. They are said to be the protectors of the supernatural, guarding the secrecy of supernatural creatures, or beings, from the world.\n\nSome supernatural dogs, such as the Welsh [[C\u0175n Annwn]], were regarded as benign, but encountering such [[hellbeast]]s was still considered a sign of imminent death.\n\n==Examples from folklore==\nThe most famous hellhound is most likely [[Cerberus]] from [[Greek mythology]]. Hellhounds are also famous for appearing in [[Northern Europe]]an [[mythology]] and [[folklore]] as a part of the [[Wild Hunt]]. These hounds are given several different names in local folklore, but they display typical hellhound characteristics. The myth is common across [[Great Britain]], and many names are given to the [[apparitional experience|apparitions]]: [[Moddey Dhoo]] of the Isle of Man, [[Gwyllgi]] of Wales. Other [[Black dog (ghost)|ghostly black dogs]] exist in legend. The earliest mention of these myths are in both [[Walter Map]]'s ''De Nugis Curialium'' (1190) and the Welsh myth cycle of the [[Four Branches of the Mabinogi|Four Branches of the ''Mabinogi'']] (c. tenth to thirteenth century).\n\nIn southern Mexico and [[Central America]] folklore, the [[cadejo]] is a big black dog that haunts travellers who walk late at night on rural roads. The term is also common in American blues music, such as with [[Robert Johnson]]'s 1937 song, \"[[Hellhound on My Trail]]\".\n\nIn Greek mythology the hellhound Cerberus belonged to [[Hades]], the Greek god of the underworld. Cerberus was said to be a massive, three-headed black dog that guarded the entrance to the underworld.\n\n===Appalachian Hellhound===\nDescribed as a very large dark black dog like creature that in some regions has only 3 toes. It is said to hunt the back mountain roads of Kentucky and West Virginia. It is likely this legend stems from earlier Scots Irish and Welsh folklore though some claim to see it still today.<ref>http://creepyhistory.com/2017/12/01/the-hell-hound-of-appalachia/</ref>\n\n===Barghest===\n{{Main|Barghest}}\n'''Barghest''', '''Bargtjest''', '''Bo-guest''', '''Bargest''' or '''Barguest''' is the name often given in the north of [[England]], especially in [[Yorkshire]], to a legendary monstrous [[Black dog (ghost)|black dog]] with huge teeth and claws, though in other cases the name can refer to a [[ghost]] or [[household deity|household elf]], especially in Northumberland and Durham (see [[Cauld Lad of Hylton]]). One is said to frequent a remote gorge named [[Troller's Gill]]. There is also a story of a Barghest entering the city of [[York]] occasionally, where, according to legend, it preys on lone travelers in the city's narrow [[Snickelways of York|Snickelways]]. [[Whitby]] is also associated with the spectre.<ref>Shaw Jeffrey,  ''Whitby Lore and Legend'' (1923)</ref> A famous Barghest was said to live near Darlington which was said to take the form of a headless man (who would vanish in flames), a headless lady, a white cat, a dog, rabbit and black dog. Another was said to live in an \"uncannie-looking\" dale between Darlington and Houghton, near Throstlenest.<ref name=\"Henderson\">{{cite book|last=Henderson|first=William|title=Notes on the folk-lore of the northern counties of England and the borders|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Notes_on_the_folk-lore_of_the_northern_counties_of_England_and_the_borders/Chapter_7#275|edition=2nd|year=1879|publisher=Folk-Lore Society|page=275|chapter=Ch. 7}}</ref>\n\nThe derivation of the word ''barghest'' is disputed. ''[[Ghost]]'' in the north of England was once pronounced ''guest'', and the name is thought to be ''burh-ghest'': town-ghost. Others explain it as German ''Berg-geist'' (mountain spirit), or ''B\u00e4r-geist'' (bear-spirit), in allusion to its alleged appearance at times as a bear. Another mooted derivation is \"Bier-Geist\", the \"spirit of the funeral bier\".\n\n===Bearer of Death===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\nThe Bearer of Death is a term used in describing the Hellhound. Hellhounds have been said to be as black as coal and smell of burning brimstone. They tend to leave behind a burned area wherever they go. Their eyes are a deep, bright, and almost glowing red. They have razor sharp teeth, super strength, and speed, and are commonly associated with graveyards and the underworld. Hellhounds are called '''The Bearers of Death''' because they were supposedly created by ancient demons to serve as heralds of death. According to legend, seeing one leads to a person's death. Sometimes it is said to be once; other times it requires three sightings for the curse to take effect and kill the victim. These factors make the Hellhound a feared symbol and worthy of the name \"Bearer of Death\".\n\n===Black Shuck===\n{{Main|Black Shuck}}\n'''Black Shuck''' or '''Old Shuck''' is the name given to a [[ghost]]ly black dog said to roam the [[Norfolk]], [[Essex]], and [[Suffolk]] coastline of England. For centuries, locals have told tales of a large black dog with malevolent flaming red eyes. According to reports, the beast varies in size and stature from that of a large [[dog]] to the size of a [[horse]]. Sometimes Black Shuck has appeared headless, and at other times he appears to float on a carpet of [[mist]]. According to [[folklore]], the spectre often haunts [[graveyard]]s, sideroads, [[Junction (road)|crossroads]] and dark [[forest]]s.\n\nThere are [[legend]]s of Black Shuck roaming the Anglian countryside since before [[Vikings]]. His name may derive from the [[Old English]] word ''scucca'' meaning \"[[demon]]\", or possibly from the local [[dialect]] word ''shucky'' meaning \"shaggy\" or \"[[hairy]]\". The legend may have been part of the inspiration for the [[Sherlock Holmes]] [[novel]] ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles]]''.\n\nIt is said that his appearance bodes ill to the beholder, although not always. More often than not, stories tell of Black Shuck terrifying his victims, but leaving them alone to continue living normal lives; in some cases it has supposedly happened before close relatives to the observer die or become ill. In other tales the dog is considered relatively benign, and said to accompany women on their way home in the role of protector rather than a portent of ill omen.<ref>The Tollesbury Midwife</ref>\n\nOne of the most notable reports of Black Shuck is of his appearance at the [[church (building)|churches]] of [[Bungay, Suffolk|Bungay]] and [[Blythburgh]] in Suffolk. On 4 August 1577, at Blythburgh, Black Shuck is said to have burst in through the church doors. He ran up the nave, past a large congregation, killing a man and boy and causing the church tower to collapse through the roof. As the dog departed, he left scorch marks on the north door that remain to this day. Two men were touched by the beast and fell down dead.\n\nThe encounter on the same day at Bungay was described in ''A Strange and Terrible Wonder'' by the Reverend [[Abraham Fleming]] in 1577:\n\n{{quote|This black dog, or the devil in such a linenesse (God hee knoweth al who worketh all,) running all along down the body of the church with great swiftness, and incredible haste, among the people, in a visible forum and shape, passed between two persons, as they were kneeling upon their knees, and occupied in prayer as it seemed, wrung the necks of them both at one instant clene backward, in so much that even at a moment where they knelled, they strangely died.}}\n\nOther accounts attribute the event to [[lightning]] or the [[Devil]]. The scorch marks on the door are referred to by the locals as \"the devil's fingerprints\".\n\n===Dip===\nIn Catalan myth, [[Dip (Catalan myth)|Dip]] is an evil, black, hairy dog, an emissary of the Devil, who sucks people's blood. Like other figures associated with demons in Catalan myth, he is lame in one leg. Dip is pictured on the escutcheon of Pratdip.\n\n===C\u0175n Annwn===\n{{Main|C\u0175n Annwn}}\nIn [[Welsh mythology]] and folklore, '''C\u0175n Annwn''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|k|u\u02d0|n|_|\u02c8|\u00e6|n|\u028a|n}}; \"hounds of [[Annwn]]\") were the spectral hounds of Annwn, the [[otherworld]] of Welsh myth. They were associated with a form of the [[Wild Hunt]], presided over by [[Gwynn ap Nudd]] (rather than [[Arawn]], king of Annwn in the [[Mabinogi|First Branch of the Mabinogi]]). [[Christians]] came to dub these mythical creatures as \"The Hounds of Hell\" or \"Dogs of Hell\" and theorised they were therefore owned by Satan.<ref>{{cite book |last = Pugh |first = Jane |title = Welsh Ghostly Encounters |publisher = Gwasg Carreg Gwalch |year = 1990|isbn = 0-86381-791-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title = Celtic Mythology |publisher = Geddes and Grosset |year = 1999|isbn = 1-85534-299-5}}</ref> However, the Annwn of medieval Welsh tradition is an otherworldly paradise and not a hell or abode of dead souls.\n\nIn [[Wales]], they were associated with [[Bird migration|migrating]] [[goose|geese]], supposedly because their honking in the night is reminiscent of barking dogs. They are supposed to hunt on specific nights (the eves of [[John the Apostle|St. John]], [[Martin of Tours|St. Martin]], Saint [[Michael the Archangel]], [[All Saints' Day|All Saints]], [[Christmas]], [[New Year]], [[Saint Agnes]], [[Saint David]], and [[Good Friday]]), or just in the autumn and winter. Some say Arawn only hunts from Christmas to [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} The C\u0175n Annwn also came to be regarded as the escorts of souls on their journey to the [[Otherworld]].\nThe hounds are sometimes accompanied by a fearsome hag called [[Mallt-y-Nos]], \"Matilda of the Night\". An alternative name in Welsh folklore is C\u0175n Mamau (\"Hounds of the Mothers\").\n\nIn other traditions similar spectral hounds are found, e.g., Gabriel Hounds ([[England]]), Ratchets ([[England]]), Yell Hounds ([[Isle of Man]]), related to [[Herne the Hunter]]'s hounds, which form part of the [[Wild Hunt]].\n\nHunting grounds for the C\u0175n Annwn are said to include the mountain of [[Cadair Idris]], where it is believed \"the howling of these huge dogs foretold death to anyone who heard them\".{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}\n\nAccording to Welsh folklore, their growling is loudest when they are at a distance, and as they draw nearer, it grows softer and softer. Their coming is generally seen as a death portent.\n\n===Moddey Dhoo===\nThe [[Moddey Dhoo]], also referred to as Mauthe Dhoog, is known to inhabit only one locale; Peel Castle on the Isle of Man.  The most famous interaction occurred between the dog and a guard.  The guard, emboldened by alcohol, determined that he would find and deal with this haunter.  So off he went alone down the corridors of the castle.  Shortly thereafter, his screams were heard.  When he was found, he mentioned only the dog.  Several days later he died.<ref>Rose, Carol.

According to Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, the yeth hound is a headless dog, said to be the spirit of an unbaptised child, which rambles through the woods at night making wailing noises. The yeth hound is also mentioned in The Denham Tracts.\n\n===Church Grim===\n{{main|Church grim}}\nThe '''Church Grim''', '''Kirk Grim''', '''Kyrkogrim''' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]) or '''Kirkonv\u00e4ki''' ([[Finnish language|Finnish]]) is a figure from [[English folklore|English]] and [[Scandinavian folklore]].

It is huge, black, with eyes the size of saucers and (in some versions of the legend) a chain which it drags behind it, the sound of which is often the first warning victims have of its presence.  After ambushing its victim it circles them at great speed, terrifying them, although never doing physical harm.

It is said to resemble the dog of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics, with the pointed ears and thin bodies, but consumed by age old demonic rot. Its chain portends of its arrival and after circling its prey for a short amount of time it chooses whether or not that soul is worth \"tagging\" for demonic possession.

It has the ability to breathe fire. However, the Fourth Edition depicts them as nearly skeletal canines wreathed in flame. The hell hound enjoys causing pain and suffering and it hunts accordingly. A favorite pack tactic is to silently surround prey, and then cause two hell hounds to close in and make the victim back into another hell hound's fiery breath. They will attack with their claws and teeth if they have to. If the prey manages to escape, the hell hounds will pursue it relentlessly. Hell hounds are also quick and agile. Another type of hell hound is the Nessian warhound. Nessian warhounds are coal black mastiffs the size of [[draft horse]]s, and are often fitted with shirts of infernal chainmail. Hell hounds cannot speak, but understand Infernal.\n\nThe hell hound was ranked ninth among the ten best low-level monsters by the authors of ''Dungeons & Dragons For Dummies''.

A wide variety of ominous or [[hell]]ish supernatural dogs occur in mythologies around the world. Features that have been attributed to hellhounds include mangled black fur, glowing red eyes, super strength and speed, [[ghost]]ly or phantom characteristics, and a foul odor. \nCertain European legends state that if someone stares into a hellhound's eyes three times or more, that person will surely die. In cultures that associate the afterlife with fire, hellhounds may have fire-based abilities and appearance. They are often assigned to guard the entrances to the [[underworld|world of the dead]], such as graveyards and burial grounds, or undertake other duties related to the [[afterlife]] or the [[supernatural]], such as hunting lost souls or guarding a supernatural treasure. In European legends, seeing a hellhound or hearing it howl may be an omen or even a cause of death. They are said to be the protectors of the supernatural, guarding the secrecy of supernatural creatures, or beings, from the world.\n\nSome supernatural dogs, such as the Welsh [[C\u0175n Annwn]], were regarded as benign, but encountering such [[hellbeast]]s was still considered a sign of imminent death.\n\n==Examples from folklore==\nThe most famous hellhound is most likely [[Cerberus]] from [[Greek mythology]]. Hellhounds are also famous for appearing in [[Northern Europe]]an [[mythology]] and [[folklore]] as a part of the [[Wild Hunt]]. These hounds are given several different names in local folklore, but they display typical hellhound characteristics. The myth is common across [[Great Britain]], and many names are given to the [[apparitional experience|apparitions]]: [[Moddey Dhoo]] of the Isle of Man, [[Gwyllgi]] of Wales. Other [[Black dog (ghost)|ghostly black dogs]] exist in legend. The earliest mention of these myths are in both [[Walter Map]]'s ''De Nugis Curialium'' (1190) and the Welsh myth cycle of the [[Four Branches of the Mabinogi|Four Branches of the ''Mabinogi'']] (c. tenth to thirteenth century).\n\nIn southern Mexico and [[Central America]] folklore, the [[cadejo]] is a big black dog that haunts travellers who walk late at night on rural roads. The term is also common in American blues music, such as with [[Robert Johnson]]'s 1937 song, \"[[Hellhound on My Trail]]\".\n\nIn Greek mythology the hellhound Cerberus belonged to [[Hades]], the Greek god of the underworld. Cerberus was said to be a massive, three-headed black dog that guarded the entrance to the underworld.\n\n===Appalachian Hellhound===\nDescribed as a very large dark black dog like creature that in some regions has only 3 toes. It is said to hunt the back mountain roads of Kentucky and West Virginia. It is likely this legend stems from earlier Scots Irish and Welsh folklore though some claim to see it still today.<ref>http://creepyhistory.com/2017/12/01/the-hell-hound-of-appalachia/</ref>\n\n===Barghest===\n{{Main|Barghest}}\n'''Barghest''', '''Bargtjest''', '''Bo-guest''', '''Bargest''' or '''Barguest''' is the name often given in the north of [[England]], especially in [[Yorkshire]], to a legendary monstrous [[Black dog (ghost)|black dog]] with huge teeth and claws, though in other cases the name can refer to a [[ghost]] or [[household deity|household elf]], especially in Northumberland and Durham (see [[Cauld Lad of Hylton]]). One is said to frequent a remote gorge named [[Troller's Gill]]. There is also a story of a Barghest entering the city of [[York]] occasionally, where, according to legend, it preys on lone travelers in the city's narrow [[Snickelways of York|Snickelways]]. [[Whitby]] is also associated with the spectre.<ref>Shaw Jeffrey,  ''Whitby Lore and Legend'' (1923)</ref> A famous Barghest was said to live near Darlington which was said to take the form of a headless man (who would vanish in flames), a headless lady, a white cat, a dog, rabbit and black dog. Another was said to live in an \"uncannie-looking\" dale between Darlington and Houghton, near Throstlenest.<ref name=\"Henderson\">{{cite book|last=Henderson|first=William|title=Notes on the folk-lore of the northern counties of England and the borders|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Notes_on_the_folk-lore_of_the_northern_counties_of_England_and_the_borders/Chapter_7#275|edition=2nd|year=1879|publisher=Folk-Lore Society|page=275|chapter=Ch. 7}}</ref>\n\nThe derivation of the word ''barghest'' is disputed. ''[[Ghost]]'' in the north of England was once pronounced ''guest'', and the name is thought to be ''burh-ghest'': town-ghost. Others explain it as German ''Berg-geist'' (mountain spirit), or ''B\u00e4r-geist'' (bear-spirit), in allusion to its alleged appearance at times as a bear. Another mooted derivation is \"Bier-Geist\", the \"spirit of the funeral bier\".\n\n===Bearer of Death===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\nThe Bearer of Death is a term used in describing the Hellhound. Hellhounds have been said to be as black as coal and smell of burning brimstone. They tend to leave behind a burned area wherever they go. Their eyes are a deep, bright, and almost glowing red. They have razor sharp teeth, super strength, and speed, and are commonly associated with graveyards and the underworld. Hellhounds are called '''The Bearers of Death''' because they were supposedly created by ancient demons to serve as heralds of death. According to legend, seeing one leads to a person's death. Sometimes it is said to be once; other times it requires three sightings for the curse to take effect and kill the victim. These factors make the Hellhound a feared symbol and worthy of the name \"Bearer of Death\".\n\n===Black Shuck===\n{{Main|Black Shuck}}\n'''Black Shuck''' or '''Old Shuck''' is the name given to a [[ghost]]ly black dog said to roam the [[Norfolk]], [[Essex]], and [[Suffolk]] coastline of England. For centuries, locals have told tales of a large black dog with malevolent flaming red eyes. According to reports, the beast varies in size and stature from that of a large [[dog]] to the size of a [[horse]]. Sometimes Black Shuck has appeared headless, and at other times he appears to float on a carpet of [[mist]]. According to [[folklore]], the spectre often haunts [[graveyard]]s, sideroads, [[Junction (road)|crossroads]] and dark [[forest]]s.\n\nThere are [[legend]]s of Black Shuck roaming the Anglian countryside since before [[Vikings]]. His name may derive from the [[Old English]] word ''scucca'' meaning \"[[demon]]\", or possibly from the local [[dialect]] word ''shucky'' meaning \"shaggy\" or \"[[hairy]]\". The legend may have been part of the inspiration for the [[Sherlock Holmes]] [[novel]] ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles]]''.\n\nIt is said that his appearance bodes ill to the beholder, although not always. More often than not, stories tell of Black Shuck terrifying his victims, but leaving them alone to continue living normal lives; in some cases it has supposedly happened before close relatives to the observer die or become ill. In other tales the dog is considered relatively benign, and said to accompany women on their way home in the role of protector rather than a portent of ill omen.<ref>The Tollesbury Midwife</ref>\n\nOne of the most notable reports of Black Shuck is of his appearance at the [[church (building)|churches]] of [[Bungay, Suffolk|Bungay]] and [[Blythburgh]] in Suffolk. On 4 August 1577, at Blythburgh, Black Shuck is said to have burst in through the church doors. He ran up the nave, past a large congregation, killing a man and boy and causing the church tower to collapse through the roof. As the dog departed, he left scorch marks on the north door that remain to this day. Two men were touched by the beast and fell down dead.\n\nThe encounter on the same day at Bungay was described in ''A Strange and Terrible Wonder'' by the Reverend [[Abraham Fleming]] in 1577:\n\n{{quote|This black dog, or the devil in such a linenesse (God hee knoweth al who worketh all,) running all along down the body of the church with great swiftness, and incredible haste, among the people, in a visible forum and shape, passed between two persons, as they were kneeling upon their knees, and occupied in prayer as it seemed, wrung the necks of them both at one instant clene backward, in so much that even at a moment where they knelled, they strangely died.}}\n\nOther accounts attribute the event to [[lightning]] or the [[Devil]]. The scorch marks on the door are referred to by the locals as \"the devil's fingerprints\".\n\n===Dip===\nIn Catalan myth, [[Dip (Catalan myth)|Dip]] is an evil, black, hairy dog, an emissary of the Devil, who sucks people's blood. Like other figures associated with demons in Catalan myth, he is lame in one leg. Dip is pictured on the escutcheon of Pratdip.\n\n===C\u0175n Annwn===\n{{Main|C\u0175n Annwn}}\nIn [[Welsh mythology]] and folklore, '''C\u0175n Annwn''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|k|u\u02d0|n|_|\u02c8|\u00e6|n|\u028a|n}}; \"hounds of [[Annwn]]\") were the spectral hounds of Annwn, the [[otherworld]] of Welsh myth. They were associated with a form of the [[Wild Hunt]], presided over by [[Gwynn ap Nudd]] (rather than [[Arawn]], king of Annwn in the [[Mabinogi|First Branch of the Mabinogi]]). [[Christians]] came to dub these mythical creatures as \"The Hounds of Hell\" or \"Dogs of Hell\" and theorised they were therefore owned by Satan.<ref>{{cite book |last = Pugh |first = Jane |title = Welsh Ghostly Encounters |publisher = Gwasg Carreg Gwalch |year = 1990|isbn = 0-86381-791-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title = Celtic Mythology |publisher = Geddes and Grosset |year = 1999|isbn = 1-85534-299-5}}</ref> However, the Annwn of medieval Welsh tradition is an otherworldly paradise and not a hell or abode of dead souls.\n\nIn [[Wales]], they were associated with [[Bird migration|migrating]] [[goose|geese]], supposedly because their honking in the night is reminiscent of barking dogs. They are supposed to hunt on specific nights (the eves of [[John the Apostle|St. John]], [[Martin of Tours|St. Martin]], Saint [[Michael the Archangel]], [[All Saints' Day|All Saints]], [[Christmas]], [[New Year]], [[Saint Agnes]], [[Saint David]], and [[Good Friday]]), or just in the autumn and winter. Some say Arawn only hunts from Christmas to [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} The C\u0175n Annwn also came to be regarded as the escorts of souls on their journey to the [[Otherworld]].\nThe hounds are sometimes accompanied by a fearsome hag called [[Mallt-y-Nos]], \"Matilda of the Night\". An alternative name in Welsh folklore is C\u0175n Mamau (\"Hounds of the Mothers\").\n\nIn other traditions similar spectral hounds are found, e.g., Gabriel Hounds ([[England]]), Ratchets ([[England]]), Yell Hounds ([[Isle of Man]]), related to [[Herne the Hunter]]'s hounds, which form part of the [[Wild Hunt]].\n\nHunting grounds for the C\u0175n Annwn are said to include the mountain of [[Cadair Idris]], where it is believed \"the howling of these huge dogs foretold death to anyone who heard them\".{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}\n\nAccording to Welsh folklore, their growling is loudest when they are at a distance, and as they draw nearer, it grows softer and softer. Their coming is generally seen as a death portent.\n\n===Moddey Dhoo===\nThe [[Moddey Dhoo]], also referred to as Mauthe Dhoog, is known to inhabit only one locale; Peel Castle on the Isle of Man.  The most famous interaction occurred between the dog and a guard.  The guard, emboldened by alcohol, determined that he would find and deal with this haunter.  So off he went alone down the corridors of the castle.  Shortly thereafter, his screams were heard.  When he was found, he mentioned only the dog.  Several days later he died.<ref>Rose, Carol.

According to Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, the yeth hound is a headless dog, said to be the spirit of an unbaptised child, which rambles through the woods at night making wailing noises. The yeth hound is also mentioned in The Denham Tracts.\n\n===Church Grim===\n{{main|Church grim}}\nThe '''Church Grim''', '''Kirk Grim''', '''Kyrkogrim''' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]) or '''Kirkonv\u00e4ki''' ([[Finnish language|Finnish]]) is a figure from [[English folklore|English]] and [[Scandinavian folklore]]. They are said to be the attendant spirits of churches, overseeing the welfare of their particular [[Church (building)|church]]. English Church Grims are said to enjoy loudly ringing the [[church bell|bells]]. They may appear as [[Black dog (ghost)|black dogs]] or as small, misshapen, dark-skinned people.<ref name=arrow>Arrowsmith, Nancy ''A Field Guide to the Little People'', [[London]]:Pan 1978 {{ISBN|0-330-25425-1}}</ref>\n\nThe Swedish Kyrkogrim are said to be the [[spirit]]s of animals sacrificed by [[early Christians]] at the building of a new church.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Reimund Kvideland|author2=Henning K.

It is huge, black, with eyes the size of saucers and (in some versions of the legend) a chain which it drags behind it, the sound of which is often the first warning victims have of its presence.  After ambushing its victim it circles them at great speed, terrifying them, although never doing physical harm.  Its appearance is said to herald a storm.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/jersey/about_jersey/folklore/black_dog.shtml |title=Folklore \u2013 The Black Dog of Bouley Bay |publisher=BBC |date=27 November 2014}}</ref> It has been theorised that the legend of the Black Dog was promoted \u2013 or even invented \u2013 by smugglers, perhaps with the aid of a costume, in order to keep people away from their activities in the Bay.  Another theory has it that ''Le Tchan'' (\"The Dog\") is an aural corruption of ''Le Chouan'', a J\u00e8rriais term for a French Royalist [[French Emigration (1789\u20131815)|\u00e9migr\u00e9]] (many of which took refuge in the Island during the [[French Revolution]]), and the legend took off from there.<ref>Hilsdon, Sonia. ''Jersey Witches, Ghosts & Traditions''. Norwich: Jarrold Colour Publications, 1984. Print.</ref>\n\nA similarly described apparition has been accredited to the Salt Lake Valley, of Utah State. It is said to resemble the dog of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics, with the pointed ears and thin bodies, but consumed by age old demonic rot. Its chain portends of its arrival and after circling its prey for a short amount of time it chooses whether or not that soul is worth \"tagging\" for demonic possession. Those \"tagged\" are said to suffer from paranormally bad luck when attempting righteous endeavors and great success at evil, tempting them to commit foul deeds throughout life leaving their soul for the Devil, once they die.\n\n==Fiction==\n{{example farm|section|date=September 2014}}\nHellhounds are a common monstrous creature in fantasy fiction and horror fiction, though they sometimes appear in other genres such as detective novels, or other uses.\n\n===In film===\n*A Hellhound named Sammael is one of the main antagonists in the first ''[[Hellboy (2004 film)|Hellboy]]'' film.\n*Hellhounds appear in the motion picture ''[[The Omen]]''.\n*Hellhounds appear in the movie ''[[Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief]]'' as pets of Persephone and Hades, differing from the books' portrayal of them.\n*A Hellhound named Thorn is the guardian of the vampire Max in ''[[The Lost Boys]]''.\n*Hellhounds appear in the [[Don Bluth]] film ''[[All Dogs Go to Heaven]]''.

It is classified as an [[Outsider (Dungeons & Dragons)|outsider]] from the [[Nine Hells]].\n\nThe hell hound was introduced to the game in its first supplement, ''[[Greyhawk (supplement)|Greyhawk]]'' (1975).<ref>[[Gary Gygax|Gygax, Gary]] and Robert Kuntz. ''[[Greyhawk (supplement)|Supplement I: Greyhawk]]'' (TSR, 1975)</ref> The hell hound appeared in the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set|D&D Basic Set]]'' (1977), the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Expert Set|D&D Expert Set]]'' (1981, 1983). and the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Rules Cyclopedia]]'' (1991).

''[[Monster Manual]]'' ([[Wizards of the Coast]], 2008).</ref>\n\nA hell hound resembles a mangy, skinny, somewhat demonic [[hyena]]-like creature with red eyes and draconic ears. It has the ability to breathe fire. However, the Fourth Edition depicts them as nearly skeletal canines wreathed in flame. The hell hound enjoys causing pain and suffering and it hunts accordingly. A favorite pack tactic is to silently surround prey, and then cause two hell hounds to close in and make the victim back into another hell hound's fiery breath. They will attack with their claws and teeth if they have to. If the prey manages to escape, the hell hounds will pursue it relentlessly. Hell hounds are also quick and agile. Another type of hell hound is the Nessian warhound. Nessian warhounds are coal black mastiffs the size of [[draft horse]]s, and are often fitted with shirts of infernal chainmail. Hell hounds cannot speak, but understand Infernal.\n\nThe hell hound was ranked ninth among the ten best low-level monsters by the authors of ''Dungeons & Dragons For Dummies''. The authors described them as the \"first serious representative of a class of monsters your players will be fighting against for their whole careers: evil outsiders,\" and that they are interesting because they \"introduce players to monsters with an area-effect attack (their fiery breath).\"<ref name=\"Dummies\">{{cite book|last=Slavicsek|first=Bill|authorlink=Bill Slavicsek|first2=Rich|last2=Baker|authorlink2=Richard Baker (game designer)|first3=Jeff|last3=Grubb|authorlink3=Jeff Grubb |title=Dungeons & Dragons For Dummies|publisher=For Dummies|year=2006|pages=373|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xNU7E01MCEgC&pg=PA361&dq=%22mind+flayer%22|accessdate=2009-02-12 | isbn=978-0-7645-8459-6}}</ref>\n\n===In literature===\n* In [[Rick Riordan]]'s book ''[[Percy Jackson & the Olympians]]'', the inventor [[Daedalus]] has a pet hellhound called Mrs. O'Leary, who later becomes Percy's pet.

{"title_page": "Canadian federal budget", "text_new": "{{for|the most recent Canadian budget|2019 Canadian federal budget}}\n{{More references|date=October 2019}}\n{{Original research|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn [[Canada]], '''federal budgets''' are presented annually by the [[Government of Canada]] to identify planned government spending, expected government revenue, and forecast economic conditions for the upcoming year.\n\nFederal budgets are usually released in February or March, before the start of the [[fiscal year]].  All of the provinces also present budgets.  Since provincial finances are dependent on money from the federal government, these budgets are usually released after the federal one.\n\n== Budget process ==\nThe budget is announced in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] by the [[Minister of Finance (Canada)|Minister of Finance]], who traditionally [[new shoes on budget day|wears new shoes while doing so]].<ref name=\"lop\">{{Cite web |url=https://lop.parl.ca/sites/ParlInfo/default/en_CA/Parliament/procedure/budgets |title=Finance Ministers Wearing New Shoes on Budget Day |website=Parlinfo |publisher=Library of Parliament |access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref> The Budget is then voted on by the House of Commons.  Budgets are a [[confidence (politics)|confidence]] measure, and if the House votes against it the government can fall, as happened to [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Joe Clark]]'s government in 1980.  The governing party strictly enforces [[party discipline]], usually expelling from the party caucus any government [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) who votes against the budget.  Opposition parties almost always vote against the budget.  In cases of [[minority government]], the government has normally had to include major concessions to one of the smaller parties to ensure passage of the budget.\n\nHistorically the [[official opposition]] used to prepare a complete alternative budget and present this alternative to the Canadian people along with the main budget.  In recent years, opposition parties are more likely to pick only certain aspects to criticize.  The [[Reform Party of Canada|Reform Party]] revived this practice for a time, however. A complete alternative budget is today produced each year by the [[Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives]], a non-partisan think-tank.\n\nTraditionally, the budget process was immensely secretive with little consultation.  Under Prime Minister [[Louis St. Laurent]], the Finance Minister famously would type the entire budget himself so that no secretary could read it.  This secrecy was felt to be needed for inside information could enable individuals to profit from upcoming government decisions.  The secrecy also had a large political component, as it would help undermine the response by the opposition.\n\nUnder Prime Minister [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]] and his Finance Minister [[Paul Martin]], this changed considerably.  Most of the budget would be released well before its announcement, especially any major changes so as to get feedback from the populace and the market.\n\nThe process of creating the budget is a complex one which begins within the working ranks for the Federal Government. Each year, the various departments that make up the Government (for example, Health, Transportation, Foreign Affairs, Dept of Defence, Industry, CRA, etc.) submit what are called 'The Main Estimates' to The Treasury Board Secretariat. These documents identify the planned expenditure of each department, linking these proposed expenses to programs, to objectives and ultimately to the priorities of the current ruling Government. The Treasury Board Secretariat combines these budget estimates and compiles an initial proposed budget.  From there, the Cabinet and Prime Minister's Office adjust the budget based on a series of economic, social and political factors. In reality, decisions are usually made with the primary intent of re-election and so often include advantages for key regions and lobby groups.\n\nFollowing the budget, Parliament (the Canadian Parliament) will pass an Appropriation Act (called the 'Interim Supply') which will allow individual departments to spend 3/12th of their annual budget. (The Government of Canada Fiscal Year runs from April 1 to March 31.) This partial authority enables Parliament to spend more time in examining the Estimates documents. In June, Parliament appropriates the full supply.\n\n== Summary of budgets presented since 2005 ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Fiscal year\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Tabled on\n! rowspan=\"2\"|(Unofficial) Subtitle\n! colspan=\"3\"|Minister of Finance\n! colspan=\"5\"|Initial Budget Implementation Act\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Ministry\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"|Name\n!

All of the provinces also present budgets.  Since provincial finances are dependent on money from the federal government, these budgets are usually released after the federal one.\n\n== Budget process ==\nThe budget is announced in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] by the [[Minister of Finance (Canada)|Minister of Finance]], who traditionally [[new shoes on budget day|wears new shoes while doing so]].<ref name=\"lop\">{{Cite web |url=https://lop.parl.ca/sites/ParlInfo/default/en_CA/Parliament/procedure/budgets |title=Finance Ministers Wearing New Shoes on Budget Day |website=Parlinfo |publisher=Library of Parliament |access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref> The Budget is then voted on by the House of Commons.  Budgets are a [[confidence (politics)|confidence]] measure, and if the House votes against it the government can fall, as happened to [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Joe Clark]]'s government in 1980.  The governing party strictly enforces [[party discipline]], usually expelling from the party caucus any government [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) who votes against the budget.  Opposition parties almost always vote against the budget.  In cases of [[minority government]], the government has normally had to include major concessions to one of the smaller parties to ensure passage of the budget.\n\nHistorically the [[official opposition]] used to prepare a complete alternative budget and present this alternative to the Canadian people along with the main budget.  In recent years, opposition parties are more likely to pick only certain aspects to criticize.  The [[Reform Party of Canada|Reform Party]] revived this practice for a time, however. A complete alternative budget is today produced each year by the [[Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives]], a non-partisan think-tank.\n\nTraditionally, the budget process was immensely secretive with little consultation.  Under Prime Minister [[Louis St. Laurent]], the Finance Minister famously would type the entire budget himself so that no secretary could read it.  This secrecy was felt to be needed for inside information could enable individuals to profit from upcoming government decisions.  The secrecy also had a large political component, as it would help undermine the response by the opposition.\n\nUnder Prime Minister [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]] and his Finance Minister [[Paul Martin]], this changed considerably.  Most of the budget would be released well before its announcement, especially any major changes so as to get feedback from the populace and the market.\n\nThe process of creating the budget is a complex one which begins within the working ranks for the Federal Government. Each year, the various departments that make up the Government (for example, Health, Transportation, Foreign Affairs, Dept of Defence, Industry, CRA, etc.) submit what are called 'The Main Estimates' to The Treasury Board Secretariat. These documents identify the planned expenditure of each department, linking these proposed expenses to programs, to objectives and ultimately to the priorities of the current ruling Government. The Treasury Board Secretariat combines these budget estimates and compile an initial proposed budget.  From there, the Cabinet and Prime Minister's Office adjust the budget based on a series of economic, social and political factors. In reality, decisions are usually made with the primary intent of re-election and so often include advantages for key regions and lobby groups.\n\nFollowing the budget, Parliament (the Canadian Parliament) will pass an Appropriation Act (called the 'Interim Supply') which will allow individual departments to spend 3/12th of their annual budget. (The Government of Canada Fiscal Year runs from April 1 to March 31.) This partial authority enables Parliament to spend more time in examining the Estimates documents. In June, Parliament appropriates the full supply.\n\n== Summary of budgets presented since 2005 ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Fiscal year\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Tabled on\n! rowspan=\"2\"|(Unofficial) Subtitle\n! colspan=\"3\"|Minister of Finance\n! colspan=\"5\"|Initial Budget Implementation Act\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Ministry\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"|Name\n!

The Bell and Edison patents, however, were commercially decisive, because they dominated telephone technology and were upheld by court decisions in the United States.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Antonio Meucci.jpg|[[Antonio Meucci]], 1854, constructed telephone-like devices.\nFile:JPReis.jpg|[[Johann Philipp Reis]], 1860, constructed prototype'' 'make-and-break' ''telephones, today called [[Reis telephone]].\nFile:Alexander Graham Bell.jpg| [[Alexander Graham Bell]] was awarded the first U.S. patent for the invention of the telephone in 1876.\nFile:Portrait elisha gray.jpg|[[Elisha Gray]], 1876, designed a telephone using a [[water microphone]] in Highland Park, Illinois.\nFile:Tivadar Puskas.jpg|[[Tivadar Pusk\u00e1s]] proposed the [[telephone exchange|telephone switchboard exchange]] in 1876.\nFile:Thomas_Edison,_1878.jpg|[[Thomas Edison]] invented the [[carbon microphone]] which produced a strong telephone signal.\n</gallery>\n[[File:USPTO Telephone Patent No. 174465.jpg|thumb|The master telephone patent granted to Bell, 174465, March 10, 1876]] \nThe modern telephone is the result of work of many people.<ref>Lewis Coe (1995), \"The Telephone and Its Several Inventors\"</ref> [[Alexander Graham Bell]] was, however, the first to patent the telephone, as an \"apparatus for transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically\".

On 3 November 1877, Coy applied for and received a franchise from the [[Bell Telephone Company]] for New Haven and Middlesex Counties. Coy, along with Herrick P. Frost and Walter Lewis, who provided the capital, established the District Telephone Company of New Haven on 15 January 1878.<ref name=\"DofInterior-NPS\" />\n\nThe switchboard built by Coy was, according to one source, constructed of \"carriage bolts, handles from teapot lids and bustle wire.\" According to the company records, all the furnishings of the office, including the switchboard, were worth less than forty dollars. While the switchboard could connect as many as sixty-four customers, only two conversations could be handled simultaneously and six connections had to be made for each call.<ref name=\"DofInterior-NPS\" />\n\nThe District Telephone Company of New Haven went into operation with only twenty-one subscribers, who paid $1.50 per month. By 21 February 1878, however, when the first telephone directory was published by the company, fifty subscribers were listed. Most of these were businesses and listings such as physicians, the police, and the post office; only eleven residences were listed, four of which were for persons associated with the company.<ref name=\"DofInterior-NPS\" />\n\nThe New Haven District Telephone Company grew quickly and was reorganized several times in its first years.

Some used [[Water microphone|liquid transmitters]] which soon went out of use. Some were dynamic: their diaphragms vibrated a coil of wire in the field of a permanent magnet or vice versa. Such [[sound-powered telephone]]s survived in small numbers through the 20th century in military and maritime applications where the ability to create its own electrical power was crucial. Most, however, used Edison/Berliner carbon transmitters, which were much louder than the other kinds, even though they required [[induction coil]]s, actually acting as [[impedance matching]] transformers to make it compatible to the line impedance. The Edison patents kept the Bell monopoly viable into the 20th century, by which time [[Public switched telephone network|telephone networks]] were more important than the instrument.\n\nEarly telephones were locally powered, using a dynamic transmitter or else powering the transmitter with a [[local battery]]. One of the jobs of [[outside plant]] personnel was to visit each telephone periodically to inspect the battery. During the 20th century, \"[[common battery]]\" operation came to dominate, powered by \"talk battery\" from the telephone exchange over the same wires that carried the voice signals. Late in the century, wireless handsets brought a revival of local battery power.\n\nThe earliest telephones had only one wire for both transmitting and receiving of audio, and used a [[single-wire earth return|ground return]] path, as was found in [[telegraph]] systems. The earliest dynamic telephones also had only one opening for sound, and the user alternately listened and spoke (rather, shouted) into the same hole. Sometimes the instruments were operated in pairs at each end, making conversation more convenient but also more expensive.\n\n[[File:1st Telephone Central Office.jpg|thumb|Historical marker commemorating the first telephone central office in New York State (1878)]]\nAt first, the benefits of a ''switchboard'' exchange were not exploited. Instead, telephones were leased in pairs to the [[subscriber]], for example one for his home and one for his shop, and the subscriber had to arrange with telegraph contractors to construct a line between them. Users who wanted the ability to speak to three or four different shops, suppliers etc. would obtain and set up three or four pairs of telephones. [[Western Union]], already using telegraph exchanges, quickly extended the principle to its telephones in New York City and San Francisco, and Bell was not slow in appreciating the potential.\n\nSignaling began in an appropriately primitive manner. The user alerted the other end, or the exchange operator, by whistling into the transmitter. Exchange operation soon resulted in telephones being equipped with a bell, first operated over a second wire and later with the same wire using a condenser. Telephones connected to the earliest [[Strowger switch|Strowger]] automatic exchanges had seven wires, one for the [[Changeover switch|knife switch]], one for each [[telegraph key]], one for the bell, one for the push button and two for speaking.\n\nRural and other telephones that were not on a common battery exchange had hand cranked \"[[telephone magneto|magneto]]\" generators to produce an alternating current to ring the bells of other telephones on the line and to alert the exchange operator.\n\nIn 1877 and 1878, [[Thomas Edison#Carbon telephone transmitter|Edison invented and developed the carbon microphone]] used in all telephones along with the Bell receiver until the 1980s. After protracted patent litigation, a federal court ruled in 1892 that Edison and not [[Emile Berliner]] was the inventor of the carbon microphone. The carbon microphone was also used in radio broadcasting and public address work through the 1920s.\n\n[[File:1896 telephone.jpg|thumb|1896 Telephone ([[Sweden]])]]\n\nIn the 1890s a new smaller style of telephone was introduced, the [[candlestick telephone]], packaged in three parts. The transmitter stood on a stand, known as a \"candlestick\" for its shape, hence the name. When not in use, the receiver hung on a hook with a switch in it, known as a \"switchhook.\" Previous telephones required the user to operate a separate switch to connect either the voice or the bell. With the new kind, the user was less likely to leave the phone \"off the hook\". In phones connected to magneto exchanges, the bell, induction coil, battery, and magneto were in a separate [[bell box]] called a \"[[ringer box]].\" In phones connected to common battery exchanges, the ringer box was installed under a desk, or other out of the way place, since it did not need a battery or magneto.\n\nCradle designs were also used at this time, having a handle with the receiver and transmitter attached, separate from the cradle base that housed the magneto crank and other parts. They were larger than the \"candlestick\" and more popular.\n\nDisadvantages of single-wire operation, such as [[crosstalk]] and hum from nearby AC power wires, had already led to the use of [[twisted pair]]s and, for [[long-distance telephone]]s, [[four-wire circuit]]s. Users at the beginning of the 20th century did not place [[long-distance call]]s from their own telephones but made an appointment to use a special sound-proofed long-distance [[telephone booth]] furnished with the latest technology.\n\nAround 1893, the country leading the world in telephones per 100 persons (teledensity) was Sweden with 0.55 in the whole country but 4 in Stockholm (10,000 out of a total of 27,658 subscribers).<ref>\n{{cite book|first=Alfred Roslin|last=Bennett|title=Telephone Systems of the Continent of Europe|year=1895|url=https://archive.org/stream/telephonesystems00bennrich#page/332/|page=337|accessdate=14 June 2012|ref=harv}}\n</ref> This compares with 0.4 in the US for that year.<ref>\n{{cite web|title=Early U.S. Telephone Industry Data|url=http://www.galbithink.org/telcos/early-telephone-data.htm|accessdate=15 June 2012}}\n</ref> Telephone service in Sweden developed through a variety of institutional forms: the [[International Bell Telephone Company]] (a U.S. multinational), town and village co-operatives, the General Telephone Company of Stockholm (a Swedish private company), and the Swedish Telegraph Department (part of the Swedish government). Since Stockholm consists of islands, telephone service offered relatively large advantages, but had to use submarine cables extensively. Competition between Bell Telephone and General Telephone, and later between General Telephone and the Swedish Telegraph Dept., was intense.\n\nIn 1893, the U.S. was considerably behind Sweden, New Zealand, Switzerland, and Norway in teledensity. The U.S. became the world leadership in teledensity with the rise of many independent telephone companies after the Bell patents expired in 1893 and 1894.\n\n== 20th-century developments ==\n[[File:OldReciever-ElementsOfElectricity-Pg43.png|thumb|Old Receiver schematic, c.1906]]\n[[File:W48 DBP.jpg|thumb|A German [[rotary dial]] telephone, the [[W48 (telephone)|W48]]]]\n[[File:Transmitting tower top us.jpg|thumb|Top of cellular telephone tower]]\n\nBy 1904, over three million phones in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corp.att.com/history/history1.html |title=AT&T: History: Origins |publisher=Corp.att.com |accessdate=2012-08-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820015455/http://www.corp.att.com/history/history1.html |archivedate=20 August 2012 }}</ref> were connected by manual switchboard exchanges. By 1914, the U.S. was the world leader in telephone density and had more than twice the teledensity of Sweden, New Zealand, Switzerland, and Norway. The relatively good performance of the U.S. occurred despite competing telephone networks not interconnecting.<ref>{{cite web |title=Leaders in the early spread of telephone service |url=http://purplemotes.net/2010/03/21/leaders-in-the-early-spread-of-telephone-service/ |date=21 March 2010 |publisher=Purplemotes.net |accessdate= }}</ref> On January 6th, 1927, W.

A [[carbon microphone|carbon granule transmitter]] and electromagnetic receiver were united in a single molded plastic handle, which when not in use were placed in a cradle in the base unit. The circuit diagram<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.porticus.org/bell/images/we-102.jpg |title=Archived copy |access-date=29 May 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616083345/http://www.porticus.org/bell/images/we-102.jpg |archive-date=16 June 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> of the model 102 shows the direct connection of the receiver to the line, while the transmitter was induction coupled, with energy supplied by a local battery. The coupling transformer, battery, and ringer were in a separate enclosure from the desk set. The [[rotary dial]] in the base interrupted the line current by repeatedly but very briefly disconnecting the line 1 to 10 times for each digit, and the hook switch (in the center of the circuit diagram) permanently disconnected the line and the transmitter battery while the handset was on the cradle.\n\nStarting in the 1930s, the base of the telephone also enclosed its bell and induction coil, obviating the need for a separate ringer box. Power was supplied to each subscriber line by central-office batteries instead of the user's local battery, which required periodic service. For the next half century, the network behind the telephone grew progressively larger and much more efficient, and, after the rotary dial was added, the instrument itself changed little until [[Touch-Tone]] signaling started replacing the rotary dial in the 1960s.\n\nThe [[history of mobile phones]] can be traced back to two-way radios permanently installed in vehicles such as taxicabs, police cruisers, railroad trains, and the like. Later versions such as the so-called transportables or \"bag phones\" were equipped with a cigarette-lighter plug so that they could also be carried, and thus could be used as either mobile two-way radios or as portable phones by being patched into the telephone network.\n\nIn December 1947, [[Bell Labs]] engineers [[Douglas H.

Cellular technology was undeveloped until the 1960s, when Richard H. Frenkiel and [[Joel S.

Engel, head of research at AT&T's [[Bell Labs]]. This began the era of the handheld cellular-mobile phone.\n\nCable-television companies began to use their fast-developing cable networks with ducting under the streets of the United Kingdom in the late 1980s to provide telephony services in association with major telephone companies.

On 3 November 1877, Coy applied for and received a franchise from the [[Bell Telephone Company]] for New Haven and Middlesex Counties. Coy, along with Herrick P. Frost and Walter Lewis, who provided the capital, established the District Telephone Company of New Haven on 15 January 1878.<ref name=\"DofInterior-NPS\" />\n\nThe switchboard built by Coy was, according to one source, constructed of \"carriage bolts, handles from teapot lids and bustle wire.\" According to the company records, all the furnishings of the office, including the switchboard, were worth less than forty dollars. While the switchboard could connect as many as sixty-four customers, only two conversations could be handled simultaneously and six connections had to be made for each call.<ref name=\"DofInterior-NPS\" />\n\nThe District Telephone Company of New Haven went into operation with only twenty-one subscribers, who paid $1.50 per month. By 21 February 1878, however, when the first telephone directory was published by the company, fifty subscribers were listed. Most of these were businesses and listings such as physicians, the police, and the post office; only eleven residences were listed, four of which were for persons associated with the company.<ref name=\"DofInterior-NPS\" />\n\nThe New Haven District Telephone Company grew quickly and was reorganized several times in its first years. By 1880, the company had the right from the [[Bell Telephone Company]] to service all of Connecticut and western Massachusetts. As it expanded, the company was first renamed Connecticut Telephone, and then [[Southern New England Telephone]] in 1882.<ref name=\"DofInterior-NPS\" /> The site of the first telephone exchange was granted a designation as a [[National Historic Landmark]] on 23 April 1965.

Some used [[Water microphone|liquid transmitters]] which soon went out of use. Some were dynamic: their diaphragms vibrated a coil of wire in the field of a permanent magnet or vice versa. Such [[sound-powered telephone]]s survived in small numbers through the 20th century in military and maritime applications where the ability to create its own electrical power was crucial. Most, however, used Edison/Berliner carbon transmitters, which were much louder than the other kinds, even though they required [[induction coil]]s, actually acting as [[impedance matching]] transformers to make it compatible to the line impedance. The Edison patents kept the Bell monopoly viable into the 20th century, by which time [[Public switched telephone network|telephone networks]] were more important than the instrument.\n\nEarly telephones were locally powered, using a dynamic transmitter or else powering the transmitter with a [[local battery]]. One of the jobs of [[outside plant]] personnel was to visit each telephone periodically to inspect the battery. During the 20th century, \"[[common battery]]\" operation came to dominate, powered by \"talk battery\" from the telephone exchange over the same wires that carried the voice signals. Late in the century, wireless handsets brought a revival of local battery power.\n\nThe earliest telephones had only one wire for both transmitting and receiving of audio, and used a [[single-wire earth return|ground return]] path, as was found in [[telegraph]] systems. The earliest dynamic telephones also had only one opening for sound, and the user alternately listened and spoke (rather, shouted) into the same hole. Sometimes the instruments were operated in pairs at each end, making conversation more convenient but also more expensive.\n\n[[File:1st Telephone Central Office.jpg|thumb|Historical marker commemorating the first telephone central office in New York State (1878)]]\nAt first, the benefits of a ''switchboard'' exchange were not exploited. Instead, telephones were leased in pairs to the [[subscriber]], for example one for his home and one for his shop, and the subscriber had to arrange with telegraph contractors to construct a line between them. Users who wanted the ability to speak to three or four different shops, suppliers etc. would obtain and set up three or four pairs of telephones. [[Western Union]], already using telegraph exchanges, quickly extended the principle to its telephones in New York City and San Francisco, and Bell was not slow in appreciating the potential.\n\nSignaling began in an appropriately primitive manner. The user alerted the other end, or the exchange operator, by whistling into the transmitter. Exchange operation soon resulted in telephones being equipped with a bell, first operated over a second wire and later with the same wire using a condenser. Telephones connected to the earliest [[Strowger switch|Strowger]] automatic exchanges had seven wires, one for the [[Changeover switch|knife switch]], one for each [[telegraph key]], one for the bell, one for the push button and two for speaking.\n\nRural and other telephones that were not on a common battery exchange had hand cranked \"[[telephone magneto|magneto]]\" generators to produce an alternating current to ring the bells of other telephones on the line and to alert the exchange operator.\n\nIn 1877 and 1878, [[Thomas Edison#Carbon telephone transmitter|Edison invented and developed the carbon microphone]] used in all telephones along with the Bell receiver until the 1980s. After protracted patent litigation, a federal court ruled in 1892 that Edison and not [[Emile Berliner]] was the inventor of the carbon microphone. The carbon microphone was also used in radio broadcasting and public address work through the 1920s.\n\n[[File:1896 telephone.jpg|thumb|1896 Telephone ([[Sweden]])]]\n\nIn the 1890s a new smaller style of telephone was introduced, the [[candlestick telephone]], packaged in three parts. The transmitter stood on a stand, known as a \"candlestick\" for its shape, hence the name. When not in use, the receiver hung on a hook with a switch in it, known as a \"switchhook.\" Previous telephones required the user to operate a separate switch to connect either the voice or the bell. With the new kind, the user was less likely to leave the phone \"off the hook\". In phones connected to magneto exchanges, the bell, induction coil, battery, and magneto were in a separate [[bell box]] called a \"[[ringer box]].\" In phones connected to common battery exchanges, the ringer box was installed under a desk, or other out of the way place, since it did not need a battery or magneto.\n\nCradle designs were also used at this time, having a handle with the receiver and transmitter attached, separate from the cradle base that housed the magneto crank and other parts. They were larger than the \"candlestick\" and more popular.\n\nDisadvantages of single-wire operation, such as [[crosstalk]] and hum from nearby AC power wires, had already led to the use of [[twisted pair]]s and, for [[long-distance telephone]]s, [[four-wire circuit]]s. Users at the beginning of the 20th century did not place [[long-distance call]]s from their own telephones but made an appointment to use a special sound-proofed long-distance [[telephone booth]] furnished with the latest technology.\n\nAround 1893, the country leading the world in telephones per 100 persons (teledensity) was Sweden with 0.55 in the whole country but 4 in Stockholm (10,000 out of a total of 27,658 subscribers).<ref>\n{{cite book|first=Alfred Roslin|last=Bennett|title=Telephone Systems of the Continent of Europe|year=1895|url=https://archive.org/stream/telephonesystems00bennrich#page/332/|page=337|accessdate=14 June 2012|ref=harv}}\n</ref> This compares with 0.4 in the US for that year.<ref>\n{{cite web|title=Early U.S. Telephone Industry Data|url=http://www.galbithink.org/telcos/early-telephone-data.htm|accessdate=15 June 2012}}\n</ref> Telephone service in Sweden developed through a variety of institutional forms: the [[International Bell Telephone Company]] (a U.S. multinational), town and village co-operatives, the General Telephone Company of Stockholm (a Swedish private company), and the Swedish Telegraph Department (part of the Swedish government). Since Stockholm consists of islands, telephone service offered relatively large advantages, but had to use submarine cables extensively. Competition between Bell Telephone and General Telephone, and later between General Telephone and the Swedish Telegraph Dept., was intense.\n\nIn 1893, the U.S. was considerably behind Sweden, New Zealand, Switzerland, and Norway in teledensity. The U.S. became the world leadership in teledensity with the rise of many independent telephone companies after the Bell patents expired in 1893 and 1894.\n\n== 20th-century developments ==\n[[File:OldReciever-ElementsOfElectricity-Pg43.png|thumb|Old Receiver schematic, c.1906]]\n[[File:W48 DBP.jpg|thumb|A German [[rotary dial]] telephone, the [[W48 (telephone)|W48]]]]\n[[File:Transmitting tower top us.jpg|thumb|Top of cellular telephone tower]]\n\nBy 1904, over three million phones in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corp.att.com/history/history1.html |title=AT&T: History: Origins |publisher=Corp.att.com |accessdate=2012-08-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820015455/http://www.corp.att.com/history/history1.html |archivedate=20 August 2012 }}</ref> were connected by manual switchboard exchanges. By 1914, the U.S. was the world leader in telephone density and had more than twice the teledensity of Sweden, New Zealand, Switzerland, and Norway. The relatively good performance of the U.S. occurred despite competing telephone networks not interconnecting.<ref>{{cite web |title=Leaders in the early spread of telephone service |url=http://purplemotes.net/2010/03/21/leaders-in-the-early-spread-of-telephone-service/ |date=21 March 2010 |publisher=Purplemotes.net |accessdate= }}</ref> On January 6th, 1927, W.

A [[carbon microphone|carbon granule transmitter]] and electromagnetic receiver were united in a single molded plastic handle, which when not in use were placed in a cradle in the base unit. The circuit diagram<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.porticus.org/bell/images/we-102.jpg |title=Archived copy |access-date=29 May 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616083345/http://www.porticus.org/bell/images/we-102.jpg |archive-date=16 June 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> of the model 102 shows the direct connection of the receiver to the line, while the transmitter was induction coupled, with energy supplied by a local battery. The coupling transformer, battery, and ringer were in a separate enclosure from the desk set. The [[rotary dial]] in the base interrupted the line current by repeatedly but very briefly disconnecting the line 1 to 10 times for each digit, and the hook switch (in the center of the circuit diagram) permanently disconnected the line and the transmitter battery while the handset was on the cradle.\n\nStarting in the 1930s, the base of the telephone also enclosed its bell and induction coil, obviating the need for a separate ringer box. Power was supplied to each subscriber line by central-office batteries instead of the user's local battery, which required periodic service. For the next half century, the network behind the telephone grew progressively larger and much more efficient, and, after the rotary dial was added, the instrument itself changed little until [[Touch-Tone]] signaling started replacing the rotary dial in the 1960s.\n\nThe [[history of mobile phones]] can be traced back to two-way radios permanently installed in vehicles such as taxicabs, police cruisers, railroad trains, and the like. Later versions such as the so-called transportables or \"bag phones\" were equipped with a cigarette-lighter plug so that they could also be carried, and thus could be used as either mobile two-way radios or as portable phones by being patched into the telephone network.\n\nIn December 1947, [[Bell Labs]] engineers [[Douglas H. Ring]] and [[W. Rae Young]] proposed hexagonal cell transmissions for mobile phones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.privateline.com/archive/Ringcellreport1947.pdf |title=1947 memo by Douglas H.

Cellular technology was undeveloped until the 1960s, when Richard H. Frenkiel and [[Joel S. Engel]] of Bell Labs developed the electronics.\n\nMeanwhile, the 1956 inauguration of the [[TAT-1]] cable and later [[international direct dialing]] were important steps in putting together the various continental telephone networks into a [[global network]].\n\nOn 3 April 1973, Motorola manager [[Martin Cooper (inventor)|Martin Cooper]] placed a cellular-phone call (in front of reporters) to Dr. Joel S.

In addition to replacing the traditional [[plain old telephone service]] (POTS) systems, IP telephony also competes with [[mobile phone]] networks by offering free or lower cost service via [[WiFi]] [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|hotspots]].
