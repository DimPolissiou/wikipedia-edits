The 10 foot (3 m) diameter 1.5 mile (2.4 km) [[Water tunnel (physical infrastructure)|water tunnel]] was completed in 1951 and delivers up to 500 cubic feet per second (14.2m<sup>3</sup>/s) to the Montgomery Reservoir about a mile southwest of the pass, from which the water is piped 70 miles (113 km) to Colorado Springs.

The city's population was 1,895 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].  Rainier is on the south bank of the Columbia River across from [[Kelso, Washington|Kelso]] and [[Longview, Washington]].\n\n==History==\nRainier was founded in 1851 on the south bank of the [[Columbia River]] by Charles E. Fox, the town's first postman. First called Eminence, its name was later changed to Fox's Landing and finally to Rainier. The name Rainier was taken from [[Mount Rainier]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]], which can be seen from hills above the city.  Rainier was incorporated in 1881.<ref name=\"Lewis and Clark's Columbia River\">{{cite web |title=Lewis and Clark's Columbia River|url=http://www.columbiariverimages.com/Regions/Places/rainier_oregon.html| date=November 2008|publisher=ColumbiaRiverImages.com}}</ref>\n\nFor much of the last quarter of the twentieth century, Rainier was known to the rest of [[Oregon]] as home to [[Trojan Nuclear Power Plant]], the only commercial [[nuclear reactor]] in the state, which supplied [[electricity]] to [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] and its suburbs starting in March 1976.  This reactor was closed periodically due to structural problems, and in January 1993, it was decommissioned after cracks developed in the steam tubes. On May 21, 2006, the cooling tower was demolished.\n\nThe closing of the Trojan plant set off a decline in the number of businesses in the city.  While some retail and services are available in the city, currently the only supermarket in the city is a Grocery Outlet.  Services are available in neighboring [[Clatskanie, Oregon|Clatskanie]], [[St. Helens, Oregon|St. Helens]], and in [[Longview, Washington]]. Longview is opposite Rainier, across the Columbia River, and connected to Rainier by the Lewis and Clark Bridge.\n\n{{wide image|Rainier, oregon.jpg|1500px|A panorama of Rainier, Oregon from Longview, Washington.

In the past, these places acted as separate communities. Today, most businesses and services have left these rural sites, and the communities are part of a large unincorporated area that receive services out of Rainier. These communities include [[Fern Hill, Columbia County, Oregon|Fern Hill]], Hudson, Alston, [[Apiary, Oregon|Apiary]], [[Goble, Oregon|Goble]], and [[Prescott, Oregon|Prescott]]. Except for Prescott, which is an [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] city (despite having neither a post office nor a separate telephone exchange), little remains to identify these places today other than left-over identifying signs or historic landmarks, such as abandoned or converted school buildings. Residents here may say they live in Rainier or will alternatively use the name of the individual community. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nThe [[Lewis and Clark Bridge (Columbia River)|Lewis and Clark Bridge]] spans the Columbia River, linking Rainier to [[Longview, Washington]]. It is the only bridge, that spans the entire width of the river, between [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] and [[Astoria, Oregon]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1890= 238\n|1900= 522\n|1910= 1359\n|1920= 1287\n|1930= 1353\n|1940= 1183\n|1950= 1285\n|1960= 1152\n|1970= 1731\n|1980= 1655\n|1990= 1674\n|2000= 1687\n|2010= 1895\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=2006\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018CenPopScriptOnlyDirtyFixDoNotUse\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n[[File:Rainier-Longview 1973.jpg|thumb|left|View across the Columbia River in 1973]]\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name =\"wwwcensusgov\">{{cite web|title=U.S. Census website|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-12-21}}</ref> of 2010, there were 1,895 people, 818 households, and 502 families living in the city.

The city's population was 1,895 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].  Rainier is on the south bank of the Columbia River across from [[Kelso, Washington|Kelso]] and [[Longview, Washington]].\n\n==History==\nRainier was founded in 1851 on the south bank of the [[Columbia River]] by Charles E. Fox, the town's first postman. First called Eminence, its name was later changed to Fox's Landing and finally to Rainier. The name Rainier was taken from [[Mount Rainier]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]], which can be seen from hills above the city.  Rainier was incorporated in 1881.<ref name=\"Lewis and Clark's Columbia River\">{{cite web |title=Lewis and Clark's Columbia River|url=http://www.columbiariverimages.com/Regions/Places/rainier_oregon.html| date=November 2008|publisher=ColumbiaRiverImages.com}}</ref>\n\nFor much of the last quarter of the twentieth century, Rainier was known to the rest of [[Oregon]] as home to [[Trojan Nuclear Power Plant]], the only commercial [[nuclear reactor]] in the state, which supplied [[electricity]] to [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] and its suburbs starting in March 1976.  This reactor was closed periodically due to structural problems, and in January 1993, it was decommissioned after cracks developed in the steam tubes. On May 21, 2006, the cooling tower was demolished.\n\nThe closing of the Trojan plant set off a decline in the number of businesses in the city.  While some retail and services are available in the city, currently the only supermarket in the city is a Grocery Outlet.  Services are available in neighboring [[Clatskanie, Oregon|Clatskanie]], [[St. Helens, Oregon|St. Helens]], and in [[Longview, Washington]]. Longview is opposite Rainier, across the Columbia River, and connected to Rainier by the Lewis and Clark Bridge.\n\n{{wide image|Rainier, oregon.jpg|1500px|A panorama of Rainier, Oregon from Longview, Washington.  This is a montage of eight separate photographs and can be scrolled.}}\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Trojan_implosion.gif|thumb|right|Implosion of Trojan Nuclear plant cooling tower in 2006]]\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|2.62|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|1.76|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.86|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-12-21|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|archivedate=2012-01-25}}</ref>\n\nRainier is surrounded by a number of rural communities. In the past, these places acted as separate communities. Today, most businesses and services have left these rural sites, and the communities are part of a large unincorporated area that receive services out of Rainier. These communities include [[Fern Hill, Columbia County, Oregon|Fern Hill]], Hudson, Alston, [[Apiary, Oregon|Apiary]], [[Goble, Oregon|Goble]], and [[Prescott, Oregon|Prescott]]. Except for Prescott, which is an [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] city (despite having neither a post office nor a separate telephone exchange), little remains to identify these places today other than left-over identifying signs or historic landmarks, such as abandoned or converted school buildings. Residents here may say they live in Rainier or will alternatively use the name of the individual community. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nThe [[Lewis and Clark Bridge (Columbia River)|Lewis and Clark Bridge]] spans the Columbia River, linking Rainier to [[Longview, Washington]]. It is the only bridge, that spans the entire width of the river, between [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] and [[Astoria, Oregon]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1890= 238\n|1900= 522\n|1910= 1359\n|1920= 1287\n|1930= 1353\n|1940= 1183\n|1950= 1285\n|1960= 1152\n|1970= 1731\n|1980= 1655\n|1990= 1674\n|2000= 1687\n|2010= 1895\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=2006\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018CenPopScriptOnlyDirtyFixDoNotUse\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n[[File:Rainier-Longview 1973.jpg|thumb|left|View across the Columbia River in 1973]]\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name =\"wwwcensusgov\">{{cite web|title=U.S. Census website|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-12-21}}</ref> of 2010, there were 1,895 people, 818 households, and 502 families living in the city.
