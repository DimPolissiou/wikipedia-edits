The episode first aired on [[NBC]] on 18 October 1985. It featured guest star [[Bruce McGill]] as an eccentric retired police officer attempting to aid [[Miami-Dade Police Department|Metro-Dade]] detectives [[Sonny Crockett|James \"Sonny\" Crockett]] and [[Rico Tubbs|Ricardo \"Rico\" Tubbs]] in the search for a missing drug lord.\n\nThe episode was the second of four in the series directed by Jim Johnston, and was written by [[John Mankiewicz]] and Douglas Lloyd McIntosh based on a story idea by McIntosh and [[Joel Surnow]]. \"Out Where the Buses Don't Run\" was well-received critically, earning a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nomination for [[Film editing|editor]] Robert A. Daniels, and appearing in [[TV Guide]]'s 1997 list of the \"[[TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time|100 Greatest TV Episodes of All Time]]\".\n\n==Plot==\nWhen [[James \"Sonny\" Crockett]] ([[Don Johnson]]) and [[Ricardo Tubbs]] ([[Philip Michael Thomas]]) arrest a small-scale drug dealer, they receive a visit at the police station from a man Crockett recognises as retired Vice officer Hank Weldon ([[Bruce McGill]]). Weldon informs the pair that the man they have arrested works for a [[drug lord]] called Tony Arcaro, who disappeared five years before after narrowly avoiding a conviction.\n\nSuspicious of Weldon's motives, and his seemingly unstable mental condition, Crockett and Tubbs visit his former police partner Marty Lang ([[David Strathairn]]), who informs them that Weldon was discharged on medical grounds rather than having retired. He had painstakingly built up a case against Arcaro and suffered a breakdown when the drug lord walked free on a technicality. When the pair go to leave, they find that Weldon has followed them, and is both defensive and furious concerning their visit to his partner. However, he reveals that Arcaro's successor, Freddie Constanza, is to be [[Contract killing|shot]] that day on Arcaro's orders. All three reach the location of the hit in time to witness Constanza being killed, and Weldon is arrested on suspicion of involvement.\n\nWeldon is later released uncharged, and acting on information he overheard from his cell-mate, tips off Crockett and Tubbs to the location of a drug deal involving Arcaro's men. When the deal is interrupted and Arcaro found to be absent, Weldon is enraged and storms off. That night, Weldon places a call to the police station claiming he has found Arcaro. When Crockett and Tubbs arrive at the scene, an abandoned tenement building, they find a disturbed but lucid Weldon, who begins to tear down a plaster wall. [[Immurement|Immured]] inside the wall is the corpse of Tony Arcaro and a newspaper from the day of his acquittal.

The episode first aired on [[NBC]] on 18 October 1985. It featured guest star [[Bruce McGill]] as an eccentric retired police officer attempting to aid [[Miami-Dade Police Department|Metro-Dade]] detectives [[Sonny Crockett|James \"Sonny\" Crockett]] and [[Rico Tubbs|Ricardo \"Rico\" Tubbs]] in the search for a missing drug lord.\n\nThe episode was the second of four in the series directed by [[Jim Johnston (director)|Jim Johnston]], and was written by [[John Mankiewicz]] and Douglas Lloyd McIntosh based on a story idea by McIntosh and [[Joel Surnow]]. \"Out Where the Buses Don't Run\" was well-received critically, earning a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nomination for [[Film editing|editor]] Robert A. Daniels, and appearing in [[TV Guide]]'s 1997 list of the \"[[TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time|100 Greatest TV Episodes of All Time]]\".\n\n==Plot==\nWhen [[James \"Sonny\" Crockett]] ([[Don Johnson]]) and [[Ricardo Tubbs]] ([[Philip Michael Thomas]]) arrest a small-scale drug dealer, they receive a visit at the police station from a man Crockett recognises as retired Vice officer Hank Weldon ([[Bruce McGill]]). Weldon informs the pair that the man they have arrested works for a [[drug lord]] called Tony Arcaro, who disappeared five years before after narrowly avoiding a conviction.\n\nSuspicious of Weldon's motives, and his seemingly unstable mental condition, Crockett and Tubbs visit his former police partner Marty Lang ([[David Strathairn]]), who informs them that Weldon was discharged on medical grounds rather than having retired. He had painstakingly built up a case against Arcaro and suffered a breakdown when the drug lord walked free on a technicality. When the pair go to leave, they find that Weldon has followed them, and is both defensive and furious concerning their visit to his partner. However, he reveals that Arcaro's successor, Freddie Constanza, is to be [[Contract killing|shot]] that day on Arcaro's orders. All three reach the location of the hit in time to witness Constanza being killed, and Weldon is arrested on suspicion of involvement.\n\nWeldon is later released uncharged, and acting on information he overheard from his cell-mate, tips off Crockett and Tubbs to the location of a drug deal involving Arcaro's men. When the deal is interrupted and Arcaro found to be absent, Weldon is enraged and storms off. That night, Weldon places a call to the police station claiming he has found Arcaro. When Crockett and Tubbs arrive at the scene, an abandoned tenement building, they find a disturbed but lucid Weldon, who begins to tear down a plaster wall. [[Immurement|Immured]] inside the wall is the corpse of Tony Arcaro and a newspaper from the day of his acquittal. Weldon does not admit to having killed Arcaro in response to the court trial, while Lang later confesses to helping build the wall\u2014to help his partner, flatly stating \"He was my partner; you understand, you understand?\" to Crockett, who confirms \"Yeah\", that he does...\n\n==Production==\n\n{{quote box\n|quote = The guy was a cop who had cracked up and spent the last seven or eight years in a lockup in Ft.

The season premiered on November 4, 1988, with the episode \"Hostile Takeover (Part 2)\". The series concluded on May 21, 1989, with \"Freefall\", after 17 episodes, but later NBC aired three new episodes after the series finale. They were \"World of Trouble\" (June 14, 1989), \"Miracle Man\" (June 21, 1989), and \"Leap of Faith\" (June 28, 1989). Additionally, [[USA Network]] aired \"Too Much, Too Late\" on January 25, 1990, since NBC would not show that episode due to its strong topic of [[child molestation]] (NBC and USA are now owned by [[NBC Universal|the same company]]). Season five regular cast members included [[Don Johnson]], [[Philip Michael Thomas]], [[Saundra Santiago]], [[Michael Talbott]], [[Olivia Brown]], and [[Edward James Olmos]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #C0C0C0\" | No.<br/>overall\n! style=\"background-color: #C0C0C0\" | No. in<br />season\n! style=\"background-color: #C0C0C0\" | Title\n! style=\"background-color: #C0C0C0\" | Directed by\n! style=\"background-color: #C0C0C0\" | Written by\n! style=\"background-color: #C0C0C0\" | Original air date\n! style=\"background-color: #C0C0C0\" | Production<br />code\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber= 92\n |EpisodeNumber2= 1\n |RTitle= \"Hostile Takeover\" (Part 2)\n |DirectedBy= [[Don Johnson]]\n |WrittenBy= Ken Solarz\n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1988|11|4}}\n |ProdCode= 63905  \t \n |ShortSummary= Sonny still assumes the identity of Burnett, unaware of his past as a police officer.

One of its earliest colonies, the planet Cynosura, has declared independence and is attempting to establish its own sphere of influence as Earth's rival. The already tense situation escalates after Earth discovers and claimed a ideally habitable world named Meraz; after negotiations over joint access to Meraz break down, the Cynosurans decide to seize the planet by force. Meraz is undefended, as the Cynosurans have made it clear that they would consider the stationing of an armed garrison there tantamount to a declaration of war.\n\nAt the orbital headquarters of Earth's Star Corps, a class of graduating cadets is assigned their new postings. Seven of the new ensigns: Oort, Fujisaki, Pressler, Vallas, McGinty, Dundee, and Jackson  are assigned a training cruise on the corvette Surprise, in the company of only two experienced officers, captain Ridnoer and first officer Ivorstetter.\n\nThe Surprise begins its patrol, which includes a docking with an Earth carrier. Meanwhile, a Cynosuran task force of five heavy cruisers intercepts a mail ship headed for Meraz and tortures its pilot to death for information. \n\nThe Surprise jumps into the Meraz system and is almost immediately ambushed by the Cynosuran task force. Vastly outgunned and with its FTL drive disabled, the corvette flees. After both of the ship's officers are lost in action, Ensign Oort assumes command.  The trainees manage to fake their ship's crash on the moon of a gas giant, and the Cynosurans resume their cautious approach to Meraz.\n\nOn the ice moon, the trainees debate their course of action. Since the Cynosurans are obviously planning to exterminate the 25,000 Earth colonists on Meraz, they vote to relaunch the ship and do everything possible to prevent the attack. Ensign Jackson protests the decision as suicidal, and demands that the Surprise either lay low or surrender to the Cynosurans. He is outvoted, and the trainees begin repairing the ship. The disgruntled Jackson attempts to violently sabotage the launch and kidnaps Oort, Vallas and McGinty, planning on murdering them.

Dictionary.com. Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary. Merriam-Webster, Inc. (accessed: November 24, 2007).</ref> are two flaps of skin on either side of the [[human]] [[vagina]]l opening in the [[vulva]], situated between the [[labia majora]] (Latin for ''larger lips;'' also called outer labia, or outer lips). The labia minora vary widely in size, color and shape from individual to individual.\n\nThe labia minora are [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to the male [[urethra]]l surface of the penis.<ref>http://www.meddean.luc.edu/lumen/MedEd/GrossAnatomy/pelvis/homology.html</ref>\n\n==Structure and functioning==\nThe labia minora extend from the [[clitoris]] obliquely downward, laterally, and backward on either side of the [[vulval vestibule]], ending between the bottom of the vulval vestibule and the labia majora. The [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] ends (bottom) of the labia minora are usually joined across the middle line by a fold of skin, named the [[frenulum of labia minora]] or fourchette.<ref name=\"Gray's\"/>\n\nOn the front, each lip forks dividing into two portions surrounding the clitoris. The upper part of each lip passes above the clitoris to meet the upper part of the other lip\u2014which will often be a little larger or smaller\u2014forming a fold which overhangs the [[glans clitoridis]] (clitoral tip or head); this fold is named the [[clitoral hood]]. The lower part passes beneath the glans clitoridis and becomes united to its under surface, forming, with the inner lip of the opposite side, the ''frenulum clitoridis''.<ref name=\"Gray's\"/>\n[[File:Vulva labeled english.jpg|thumb|left|Depilated human [[vulva]] with anatomical feature labels]]\nThe clitoral hood, analogously to the [[foreskin]] of the [[penis]] in men and also termed, like the latter, by the Latin word ''[[Clitoral hood|prepuce]]'', serves to cover most of the time the shaft and sometimes the glans (which is very sensitive to the touch) to protect the clitoris from mechanical irritation and from dryness. Yet the hood is movable and can slide during [[clitoral erection]] or be pulled upwards a little for greater exposure of the clitoris to sexual stimulation.\n\nThe frenulum (Latin for ''little bridle'') is an elastic band of tissue attached by its one end to the clitoral shaft and glans and by its other end to the prepuce. It allows two-way shifting of the clitoral hood: firstly, it can extend to let the hood be moved upwards to expose the glans for stimulation or hygienic cleansing, and secondly, it contracts to pull the hood back to protect it.\n\n===Histology===\nOn the opposed surfaces of the labia minora are numerous [[sebaceous gland]]s not associated with hair follicles.<ref name=\"Gray's\">{{Gray's|page=1265\u20131266|inline=1}}</ref> They are lined by [[stratified squamous epithelium]] on those surfaces.<ref name=\":0\">Manual of Obstetrics. (3rd ed.). Elsevier. pp. 1-16. {{ISBN|9788131225561}}.</ref>{{page needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nLike the whole area of the vulval vestibule, the mucus secreted by those glands protects the labia from dryness and mechanical irritation.\n\n===Variation===\nBeing thinner than the outer labia, the inner labia can be also more narrow than the former, or wider than labia majora, thus protruding in the [[pudendal cleft]] and making the term ''minora'' (Latin for smaller) essentially inapplicable in these cases.\n\nThe reception of wider and/or longer labia varies considerably between different people, with some men and women stressing the beauty of bigger labia while other women who have such ones complain of some discomfort either from mechanical irritation by their tighter clothes or from their own or their peers' negative attitude to the image of less compact female genitalia than is stereotypical for them.\n\nThey can also be smooth or frilled, the latter being more typical of longer or wider inner labia.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2004, researchers from the Department of Gynaecology, Elizabeth Garret Anderson Hospital in London, measured the labia and other genital structures of 50 women from the age of 18 to 50, with a mean age of 35.6.

Its proponents stress the beauty of long labia and their positive role in sexual stimulation of both partners.\n\n[[Labiaplasty]] is also sometimes sought by women who have asymmetrical labia minora to adjust the shape of the structures towards identical size.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n[[Labia stretching]] has traditionally been practiced in some African nations.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n=== Functioning ===\nThe inner lips serve to protect from mechanical irritation, dryness and infections the highly sensitive area of the [[vulval vestibule]] with vaginal and urethral openings in it between them. During vaginal sexual intercourse they may contribute to stimulation of the whole vestibule area, the clitoris and the vagina of the woman and the penis of her partner. Stimulation of the clitoris may occur through tension of the clitoral hood and its frenulum by inner labia pulling at them. During sexual arousal they are lubricated by the mucus secreted in the vagina and around it to make penetration painless and protect them from irritation.\n\nAs the [[Urinary meatus|female]] [[Urinary meatus|external urethral opening (meatus)]] is also situated between labia minora, they may play a role in guiding the stream of the urine during [[Urination|female]] [[urination]].\n\n=== Medical conditions ===\nBeing very sensitive by their structure to any irritation, and situated in the excretion area where traces of urine, [[vaginal discharge]], [[smegma]] and even [[feces]] may be present, the inner lips may be susceptible to inflammatory infections of the vulva such as [[vulvitis]].\n\nThe likelihood of inflammation may be reduced through appropriate regular hygienic cleansing of the whole vulval vestibule, using water and medically tested cleansing agents designed for vulvas. To avoid contamination of the vulva with fecal bacteria, it is recommended that the vulva is washed only from front to back, from [[mons pubis]] to the [[perineum]] and [[anus]]. Apart from water and special liquid cleansing agents (lotions), there are commercially available [[wet wipe]]s for female intimate hygiene. Some women wipe the vulval vestibule dry with toilet tissue after urination to avoid irritation and infections from residual drops of the urine in the area.\n\nHowever, incorrect choice of cleansing agents, or their incorrect application, may itself cause labial irritation and require medical attention. Over-vigorous rubbing of the labia of little girls while washing, combined with the lack of [[estrogen]] in their bodies, may lead to the mostly pediatric condition known as [[labial fusion]]. If fused labia prevent urination, urine may accumulate and cause pain and inflammation.\n\nIn adult females, irritation of the area may be caused by wearing too-tight underwear (especially where wider inner labia protrude in the pudendal cleft); while [[G-string]]s, which rub against the labia during body movements, may cause irritation or lead to infection from bacteria transferred from either the external environment or the anus.\n\n==Additional images==\n<gallery>\nFile:Illu repdt female.jpg|Organs of the female reproductive system.\nFile:Clitoris_outer_anatomy.png|Outer anatomy of clitoris.\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* ''[[Femalia]]''\n* [[Labia pride]]\n* [[Labia stretching]]\n* [[Labiaplasty]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Labia minora}}\n\n{{Female reproductive system}}\n{{Portal bar|Anatomy}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Labia Minora}}\n[[Category:Mammal female reproductive system]]\n\n[[sn:Hwabvu hutete]]\n[[de:Schamlippe#Die kleinen (inneren) Schamlippen]]\n[[pl:Wargi sromowe mniejsze]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Flaps of skin on either side of the human vaginal opening in the vulva}}\n{{Infobox anatomy\n| Name        = Labia minora\n| Latin       = labium minus pudendi\n| Image       = Labiaminora.jpg\n| Caption     = Labia minora (inner labia) - vertical folds of skin in the very middle of the photo of a vulva (external female genitals) between rounded thicker labia majora (the outer labia).\n| Width       = 250px\n| Image2      = \n| Caption2    = \n| Precursor   = [[Urogenital folds]]\n| System      = \n| Artery      = \n| Vein        = \n| Nerve       = \n| Lymph       = \n}}\nThe '''labia minora''' (Latin for ''smaller lips,'' singular: ''labium minus'' \"smaller lip\"), also known as the '''inner labia''', '''inner lips''', '''vaginal lips''' or '''nymphae''',<ref>''[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/nymphae nymphae]''. Dictionary.com. Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary. Merriam-Webster, Inc. (accessed: November 24, 2007).</ref> are two flaps of skin on either side of the [[human]] [[vagina]]l opening in the [[vulva]], situated between the [[labia majora]] (Latin for ''larger lips;'' also called outer labia, or outer lips). The labia minora vary widely in size, color and shape from individual to individual.\n\nThe labia minora are [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to the male [[urethra]]l surface of the penis.<ref>http://www.meddean.luc.edu/lumen/MedEd/GrossAnatomy/pelvis/homology.html</ref>\n\n==Structure and functioning==\nThe labia minora extend from the [[clitoris]] obliquely downward, laterally, and backward on either side of the [[vulval vestibule]], ending between the bottom of the vulval vestibule and the labia majora. The [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] ends (bottom) of the labia minora are usually joined across the middle line by a fold of skin, named the [[frenulum of labia minora]] or fourchette.<ref name=\"Gray's\"/>\n\nOn the front, each lip forks dividing into two portions surrounding the clitoris. The upper part of each lip passes above the clitoris to meet the upper part of the other lip\u2014which will often be a little larger or smaller\u2014forming a fold which overhangs the [[glans clitoridis]] (clitoral tip or head); this fold is named the [[clitoral hood]]. The lower part passes beneath the glans clitoridis and becomes united to its under surface, forming, with the inner lip of the opposite side, the ''frenulum clitoridis''.<ref name=\"Gray's\"/>\n[[File:Vulva labeled english.jpg|thumb|left|Depilated human [[vulva]] with anatomical feature labels]]\nThe clitoral hood, analogously to the [[foreskin]] of the [[penis]] in men and also termed, like the latter, by the Latin word ''[[Clitoral hood|prepuce]]'', serves to cover most of the time the shaft and sometimes the glans (which is very sensitive to the touch) to protect the clitoris from mechanical irritation and from dryness. Yet the hood is movable and can slide during [[clitoral erection]] or be pulled upwards a little for greater exposure of the clitoris to sexual stimulation.\n\nThe frenulum (Latin for ''little bridle'') is an elastic band of tissue attached by its one end to the clitoral shaft and glans and by its other end to the prepuce. It allows two-way shifting of the clitoral hood: firstly, it can extend to let the hood be moved upwards to expose the glans for stimulation or hygienic cleansing, and secondly, it contracts to pull the hood back to protect it.\n\n===Histology===\nOn the opposed surfaces of the labia minora are numerous [[sebaceous gland]]s not associated with hair follicles.<ref name=\"Gray's\">{{Gray's|page=1265\u20131266|inline=1}}</ref> They are lined by [[stratified squamous epithelium]] on those surfaces.<ref name=\":0\">Manual of Obstetrics.

Its proponents stress the beauty of long labia and their positive role in sexual stimulation of both partners.\n\n[[Labiaplasty]] is also sometimes sought by women who have asymmetrical labia minora to adjust the shape of the structures towards identical size.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n[[Labia stretching]] has traditionally been practiced in some African nations.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n=== Functioning ===\nThe inner lips serve to protect from mechanical irritation, dryness and infections the highly sensitive area of the [[vulval vestibule]] with vaginal and urethral openings in it between them. During vaginal sexual intercourse they may contribute to stimulation of the whole vestibule area, the clitoris and the vagina of the woman and the penis of her partner. Stimulation of the clitoris may occur through tension of the clitoral hood and its frenulum by inner labia pulling at them. During sexual arousal they are lubricated by the mucus secreted in the vagina and around it to make penetration painless and protect them from irritation.\n\nAs the [[Urinary meatus|female]] [[Urinary meatus|external urethral opening (meatus)]] is also situated between labia minora, they may play a role in guiding the stream of the urine during [[Urination|female]] [[urination]].\n\n=== Medical conditions ===\nBeing very sensitive by their structure to any irritation, and situated in the excretion area where traces of urine, [[vaginal discharge]], [[smegma]] and even [[feces]] may be present, the inner lips may be susceptible to inflammatory infections of the vulva such as [[vulvitis]].\n\nThe likelihood of inflammation may be reduced through appropriate regular hygienic cleansing of the whole vulval vestibule, using water and medically tested cleansing agents designed for vulvas. To avoid contamination of the vulva with fecal bacteria, it is recommended that the vulva is washed only from front to back, from [[mons pubis]] to the [[perineum]] and [[anus]]. Apart from water and special liquid cleansing agents (lotions), there are commercially available [[wet wipe]]s for female intimate hygiene. Some women wipe the vulval vestibule dry with toilet tissue after urination to avoid irritation and infections from residual drops of the urine in the area.\n\nHowever, incorrect choice of cleansing agents, or their incorrect application, may itself cause labial irritation and require medical attention. Over-vigorous rubbing of the labia of little girls while washing, combined with the lack of [[estrogen]] in their bodies, may lead to the mostly pediatric condition known as [[labial fusion]]. If fused labia prevent urination, urine may accumulate and cause pain and inflammation.\n\nIn adult females, irritation of the area may be caused by wearing too-tight underwear (especially where wider inner labia protrude in the pudendal cleft); while [[G-string]]s, which rub against the labia during body movements, may cause irritation or lead to infection from bacteria transferred from either the external environment or the anus.\n\n==Additional images==\n<gallery>\nFile:Illu repdt female.jpg|Organs of the female reproductive system.\nFile:Clitoris_outer_anatomy.png|Outer anatomy of clitoris.\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* ''[[Femalia]]''\n* [[Labia pride]]\n* [[Labia stretching]]\n* [[Labiaplasty]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Labia minora}}\n\n{{Female reproductive system}}\n{{Portal bar|Anatomy}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Labia Minora}}\n[[Category:Mammal female reproductive system]]\n\n[[sn:Hwabvu hutete]]\n[[de:Schamlippe#Die kleinen (inneren) Schamlippen]]\n[[pl:Wargi sromowe mniejsze]]\n", "name_user": "2600:1006:b161:e903:4408:21ab:cb71:bccf", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Replaced a couple of the photos with better photos to get the point across better)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labia_minora"}

The regular series aired from January 26, 1994, and ran for five full seasons. Due to Warner corporate structure and policy concerning syndication in general, and syndication of properties produced by the defunct [[Prime Time Entertainment Network|PTEN]] division in particular, the show has been syndicated only briefly, and did not appear on U.S. television from 2003 through 2018 (though it has aired in other countries). In 2018, the show began airing nightly on the Comet TV Sci-Fi Network. The show spawned six television films and a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series, ''[[Crusade (TV series)|Crusade]]'', which aired in 1999 and ran for 13 episodes. On July 31, 2007, a [[DVD]] was released containing two short films about selected characters from the series.\n\nThe five seasons of the series each correspond to one fictional sequential year in the period 2258\u20132262. Each season shares its name with an episode that is central to that season's plot. As the series starts, the Babylon 5 station is welcoming ambassadors from various races in the galaxy. Earth has just barely survived an accidental war with the powerful [[Minbari]], who, despite their superior technology, mysteriously surrendered at the brink of the destruction of the human race.\n\nSome episodes in the second season were aired out of their intended chronological sequence. Straczynski confirmed that in Season 2, \"A Race Through Dark Places\" should precede \"Soul Mates,\" and that \"Knives\" should precede \"In the Shadow of Z'ha'dum.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=which comes first...|author=Straczynski, J.

As a consequence, several cast members left the series: [[Tamlyn Tomita]] (Lt. Cmdr. [[Laurel Takashima]]), [[Patricia Tallman]] ([[Lyta Alexander]]) and [[Johnny Sekka]] (Dr. [[Benjamin Kyle (Babylon 5)|Benjamin Kyle]]), hence the introduction of Lt. Cmdr. [[Susan Ivanova|Ivanova]] and [[Talia Winters]] in this episode. For that same reason, the episode also recaps many of the relationships between races touched on in the pilot: the Earth-Minbari War, the occupation of Narn, and the decline of the Centauri Republic.\n\nSeason 1 is set during the year 2258, when [[Jeffrey Sinclair|Commander Jeffrey Sinclair]] is in charge of the station, assisted by executive officer [[Susan Ivanova]] and security chief [[Michael Garibaldi]]. The season traces his gradual recollection of his capture by the Minbari during their war with humans. The Minbari came to believe that Sinclair carried the soul of [[List of Babylon 5 characters#V|Valen]], a revered Minbari leader. Inferring that Minbari souls were being reborn as humans, the Minbari surrendered to avoid further [[fratricide]]. This action is a source of internal strife between some Minbari.\n\nMeanwhile, tensions between the Centauri Republic, an empire in decline, and the Narn Regime, a former Centauri dominion which successfully rebelled, are increasing. Seeking for his people to regain their former prominence, Mollari makes a deal with a mysterious ally, Mr. Morden, to strike back at the Narn. On Earth, some humans resent the influence of aliens, and seek to eliminate them from Earth-owned property, including ''Babylon 5''.\n\nMinbari [[Delenn|Ambassador Delenn]] is revealed to belong to the Grey Council, the Minbari ruling body. She eventually transforms into a Minbari/human hybrid, ostensibly to build a bridge between the humans and Minbari. The year ends with the death of [[Earth Alliance (Babylon 5)|Earth Alliance]] president Luis Santiago, which the staff of ''Babylon 5'' believe to have been an assassination.\n{{Episode table |background=#A12800|overall=4 |season=4 |title=19 |director=15 |writer=18 |airdate=14 |prodcode=6 |episodes=\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 1\n |Title = Midnight on the Firing Line\n |DirectedBy = [[Richard Compton]]\n |WrittenBy = [[J.

Historically tense relations between Earth and its Mars colony reach breaking point when Mars declares independence and Earth's government declares martial law and attacks. Sheridan, outraged, withdraws ''Babylon 5'' from the Earth Alliance, supported by the Minbari.\n\nThe fate of ''Babylon 4'' is discovered when Sinclair returns to the station to request Sheridan's help: Sinclair had been destined to use time travel to take ''Babylon 4'' back in time to the previous Minbari-Shadow war, where he is transformed into the revered Minbari leader, Valen, using the same device Delenn used for her transformation.\n\nAmbassador Mollari realizes his deal with the Shadows has become dangerous and tries to sever ties with Mr. Morden, but fails. Kosh informs Sheridan that the Shadows can be fought with telepaths. The Vorlons attack the Shadows at Sheridan's insistence, but the Shadows kill Kosh in retaliation.\n\nSheridan's wife, presumed dead on an archaeological dig on the planet Z'ha'dum years earlier, arrives at the station and convinces Sheridan to accompany her to Z'ha'dum. The Shadows attempt to force Sheridan to join their cause, their ships threatening ''Babylon 5''. Sheridan, guided by Kosh's words, flies a vessel loaded with explosives into the planet while jumping into a large chasm. The Shadow ships withdraw, but Garibaldi, deployed to defend the station, does not return.\n\nThe season ends with the episode \"Z'ha'dum\", which Rowan Kaiser of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' praised as one of ''Babylon 5''{{'}}s strongest. Kaiser particularly stressed the characterization of Sheridan in the episode, helping to give his character meaning that had otherwise been absent or vague in previous episodes.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/babylon-5-zhadum-102103 | title = Babylon 5: \"Z\u2019ha\u2019dum\" | date = September 6, 2013 | accessdate = November 24, 2015 | work = [[The A.V.

The Vorlons alarm the other races when they begin destroying entire planets that have been influenced by the Shadows. Mollari, fearing the Vorlons will destroy Centauri Prime, destroys the Shadow base there and executes Mr. Morden. Sheridan learns that the Vorlons and Shadows were tasked as caretakers for younger races in the galaxy, but due to profound differences in ideology have been at war for eons, using the younger races as pawns in a [[proxy war]]. With the help of other ancient races, Sheridan convinces the Vorlons and Shadows to leave and cease interfering with the younger races.\n\nGaribaldi returns to ''Babylon 5'', with no explanation for his disappearance. He has unexplained changes in behavior and distances himself from the command staff, resigning and relocating to Mars to work with tycoon William Edgars. He also subdues Sheridan, allowing the latter to be kidnapped. It is revealed that Garibaldi was co-opted by the Psi-Corps to spy on Edgars, who is found to be developing a virus to destroy telepaths.\n\nWith the Vorlons and Shadows gone, Earth's totalitarian government attempts to use the captured Sheridan as a propaganda tool, but Garibaldi - now free from Psi-Corps influence - rescues him. A brief civil war breaks out on Earth, culminating in President Clark's suicide and Sheridan's surrender to Earth forces. Ivanova is critically injured in the war, and leaves the station to take command of her own vessel.\n\nThe League of Non-Aligned Worlds are reorganized into an Interstellar Alliance with Earth, Minbar, Narn, and Centauri, acting as a United Nations across the galaxy, with the [[Anla'shok|Rangers]] as their enforcers. Sheridan is made president of the Alliance, and he and Delenn marry.\n\n{{Episode table |background=#990099|overall=4 |season=4 |title=19 |director=15 |writer=18 |airdate=14 |prodcode=6 |episodes=\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 67\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 1\n |Title = The Hour of the Wolf\n |DirectedBy = [[David J.

A conflict arises between Psi-Corps and a group of rogue telepaths that are seeking their own homeworld after learning that the Vorlons created telepaths as weapons against the Shadows. When several telepaths [[martyr]] themselves, Lyta leads attacks against the Psi-Corps, becoming an [[enemy of the state]].\n\nMeanwhile, Alliance trade and civilian ships are being attacked by an unknown force, and evidence is discovered that the Centauri may be involved. Mollari discovers that the Drakh, a Shadow-allied race, have forced the Centauri leadership to precipitate war with the Alliance, in part as revenge for Mollari's turn against the Shadows. Mollari is forced to co-operate when he becomes Emperor, and withdraws the Centauri from the Alliance. Vir becomes the Centauri ambassador on the station.\n\nSeparate stories show the long-standing members of ''Babylon 5'' making plans to leave the station: Sheridan and Delenn move to the Alliance's permanent headquarters on Minbar. Garibaldi, having relapsed in his alcoholism, is aided by Lise, and the two marry and return to Mars. Dr. Franklin takes a position on Earth as head of xenobiology.

Drawing his last breaths, he is met by Lorien, who invites Sheridan to travel beyond the galactic rim.

Michael Straczynski]]. The show centers on the [[Babylon 5 (space station)|Babylon 5]] [[space station]]: a focal point for politics, diplomacy, and conflict during the years 2257\u20132262. With its prominent use of planned [[story arc]]s, the series was often described as a \"novel for television\".<ref name=\"soaps1\">{{cite web|first=Jo-Ann |last=Parks |title=Soap Opera 'Babylon' \u2013 B5 and the Soaps |url=http://www.space.com/sciencefiction/tv/soap_opera_babylon_000317.html |work=SPACE.com |publisher=Imaginova Corp |date=2000-03-17 |accessdate=2009-10-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070420190701/http://www.space.com/sciencefiction/tv/soap_opera_babylon_000317.html |archivedate=April 20, 2007 }}<!-- original cite {{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/sciencefiction/tv/soap_opera_babylon_000317.html |title=Soap Opera 'Babylon' |publisher=Space.com |date=2000-03-17 |accessdate=2006-09-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070420190701/http://www.space.com/sciencefiction/tv/soap_opera_babylon_000317.html |archivedate=2007-04-20 }} --></ref><ref name=\"cnn1\">{{cite news |first=Dennis |last=Michael |title='Babylon 5' prepares for final bow |url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/TV/9811/20/babylon.5/ |work=[[CNN|CNN.com]] |publisher=Cable News Network |date=1998-11-20 |accessdate=2009-10-18}}<!-- Original cite 2 {{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/TV/9811/20/babylon.5/ |title=\"Babylon 5\" Prepares For Final Bow |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=1998-11-20 |accessdate=2007-08-21}} --></ref>\n\nThe pilot film premiered on February 22, 1993. The regular series aired from January 26, 1994, and ran for five full seasons. Due to Warner corporate structure and policy concerning syndication in general, and syndication of properties produced by the defunct [[Prime Time Entertainment Network|PTEN]] division in particular, the show has been syndicated only briefly, and did not appear on U.S. television from 2003 through 2018 (though it has aired in other countries). In 2018, the show began airing nightly on the Comet TV Sci-Fi Network. The show spawned six television films and a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series, ''[[Crusade (TV series)|Crusade]]'', which aired in 1999 and ran for 13 episodes. On July 31, 2007, a [[DVD]] was released containing two short films about selected characters from the series.\n\nThe five seasons of the series each correspond to one fictional sequential year in the period 2258\u20132262. Each season shares its name with an episode that is central to that season's plot. As the series starts, the Babylon 5 station is welcoming ambassadors from various races in the galaxy. Earth has just barely survived an accidental war with the powerful [[Minbari]], who, despite their superior technology, mysteriously surrendered at the brink of the destruction of the human race.\n\nSome episodes in the second season were aired out of their intended chronological sequence. Straczynski confirmed that in Season 2, \"A Race Through Dark Places\" should precede \"Soul Mates,\" and that \"Knives\" should precede \"In the Shadow of Z'ha'dum.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=which comes first...|author=Straczynski, J.

As a consequence, several cast members left the series: [[Tamlyn Tomita]] (Lt. Cmdr. [[Laurel Takashima]]), [[Patricia Tallman]] ([[Lyta Alexander]]) and [[Johnny Sekka]] (Dr. [[Benjamin Kyle (Babylon 5)|Benjamin Kyle]]), hence the introduction of Lt. Cmdr. [[Susan Ivanova|Ivanova]] and [[Talia Winters]] in this episode. For that same reason, the episode also recaps many of the relationships between races touched on in the pilot: the Earth-Minbari War, the occupation of Narn, and the decline of the Centauri Republic.\n\nSeason 1 is set during the year 2258, when [[Jeffrey Sinclair|Commander Jeffrey Sinclair]] is in charge of the station, assisted by executive officer [[Susan Ivanova]] and security chief [[Michael Garibaldi]]. The season traces his gradual recollection of his capture by the Minbari during their war with humans. The Minbari came to believe that Sinclair carried the soul of [[List of Babylon 5 characters#V|Valen]], a revered Minbari leader. Inferring that Minbari souls were being reborn as humans, the Minbari surrendered to avoid further [[fratricide]]. This action is a source of internal strife between some Minbari.\n\nMeanwhile, tensions between the Centauri Republic, an empire in decline, and the Narn Regime, a former Centauri dominion which successfully rebelled, are increasing. Seeking for his people to regain their former prominence, Mollari makes a deal with a mysterious ally, Mr. Morden, to strike back at the Narn. On Earth, some humans resent the influence of aliens, and seek to eliminate them from Earth-owned property, including ''Babylon 5''.\n\nMinbari [[Delenn|Ambassador Delenn]] is revealed to belong to the Grey Council, the Minbari ruling body. She eventually transforms into a Minbari/human hybrid, ostensibly to build a bridge between the humans and Minbari. The year ends with the death of [[Earth Alliance (Babylon 5)|Earth Alliance]] president Luis Santiago, which the staff of ''Babylon 5'' believe to have been an assassination.\n{{Episode table |background=#A12800|overall=4 |season=4 |title=19 |director=15 |writer=18 |airdate=14 |prodcode=6 |episodes=\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 1\n |Title = Midnight on the Firing Line\n |DirectedBy = [[Richard Compton]]\n |WrittenBy = [[J.

Historically tense relations between Earth and its Mars colony reach breaking point when Mars declares independence and Earth's government declares martial law and attacks. Sheridan, outraged, withdraws ''Babylon 5'' from the Earth Alliance, supported by the Minbari.\n\nThe fate of ''Babylon 4'' is discovered when Sinclair returns to the station to request Sheridan's help: Sinclair had been destined to use time travel to take ''Babylon 4'' back in time to the previous Minbari-Shadow war, where he is transformed into the revered Minbari leader, Valen, using the same device Delenn used for her transformation.\n\nAmbassador Mollari realizes his deal with the Shadows has become dangerous and tries to sever ties with Mr. Morden, but fails. Kosh informs Sheridan that the Shadows can be fought with telepaths. The Vorlons attack the Shadows at Sheridan's insistence, but the Shadows kill Kosh in retaliation.\n\nSheridan's wife, presumed dead on an archaeological dig on the planet Z'ha'dum years earlier, arrives at the station and convinces Sheridan to accompany her to Z'ha'dum. The Shadows attempt to force Sheridan to join their cause, their ships threatening ''Babylon 5''. Sheridan, guided by Kosh's words, flies a vessel loaded with explosives into the planet while jumping into a large chasm. The Shadow ships withdraw, but Garibaldi, deployed to defend the station, does not return.\n\nThe season ends with the episode \"Z'ha'dum\", which Rowan Kaiser of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' praised as one of ''Babylon 5''{{'}}s strongest. Kaiser particularly stressed the characterization of Sheridan in the episode, helping to give his character meaning that had otherwise been absent or vague in previous episodes.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/babylon-5-zhadum-102103 | title = Babylon 5: \"Z\u2019ha\u2019dum\" | date = September 6, 2013 | accessdate = November 24, 2015 | work = [[The A.V.

The Vorlons alarm the other races when they begin destroying entire planets that have been influenced by the Shadows. Mollari, fearing the Vorlons will destroy Centauri Prime, destroys the Shadow base there and executes Mr. Morden. Sheridan learns that the Vorlons and Shadows were tasked as caretakers for younger races in the galaxy, but due to profound differences in ideology have been at war for eons, using the younger races as pawns in a [[proxy war]]. With the help of other ancient races, Sheridan convinces the Vorlons and Shadows to leave and cease interfering with the younger races.\n\nGaribaldi returns to ''Babylon 5'', with no explanation for his disappearance. He has unexplained changes in behavior and distances himself from the command staff, resigning and relocating to Mars to work with tycoon William Edgars. He also subdues Sheridan, allowing the latter to be kidnapped. It is revealed that Garibaldi was co-opted by the Psi-Corps to spy on Edgars, who is found to be developing a virus to destroy telepaths.\n\nWith the Vorlons and Shadows gone, Earth's totalitarian government attempts to use the captured Sheridan as a propaganda tool, but Garibaldi - now free from Psi-Corps influence - rescues him. A brief civil war breaks out on Earth, culminating in President Clark's suicide and Sheridan's surrender to Earth forces. Ivanova is critically injured in the war, and leaves the station to take command of her own vessel.\n\nThe League of Non-Aligned Worlds are reorganized into an Interstellar Alliance with Earth, Minbar, Narn, and Centauri, acting as a United Nations across the galaxy, with the [[Anla'shok|Rangers]] as their enforcers. Sheridan is made president of the Alliance, and he and Delenn marry.\n\n{{Episode table |background=#990099|overall=4 |season=4 |title=19 |director=15 |writer=18 |airdate=14 |prodcode=6 |episodes=\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 67\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 1\n |Title = The Hour of the Wolf\n |DirectedBy = [[David J.

A conflict arises between Psi-Corps and a group of rogue telepaths that are seeking their own homeworld after learning that the Vorlons created telepaths as weapons against the Shadows. When several telepaths [[martyr]] themselves, Lyta leads attacks against the Psi-Corps, becoming an [[enemy of the state]].\n\nMeanwhile, Alliance trade and civilian ships are being attacked by an unknown force, and evidence is discovered that the Centauri may be involved. Mollari discovers that the Drakh, a Shadow-allied race, have forced the Centauri leadership to precipitate war with the Alliance, in part as revenge for Mollari's turn against the Shadows. Mollari is forced to co-operate when he becomes Emperor, and withdraws the Centauri from the Alliance. Vir becomes the Centauri ambassador on the station.\n\nSeparate stories show the long-standing members of ''Babylon 5'' making plans to leave the station: Sheridan and Delenn move to the Alliance's permanent headquarters on Minbar. Garibaldi, having relapsed in his alcoholism, is aided by Lise, and the two marry and return to Mars. Dr. Franklin takes a position on Earth as head of xenobiology.

Alone, Sheridan revisits ''Babylon 5'', now being decommissioned, before continuing to the location of the final Vorlon/Shadow encounter. Drawing his last breaths, he is met by Lorien, who invites Sheridan to travel beyond the galactic rim. Sheridan's ship is found adrift and empty some days later.\n\n{{Episode table |background=#694F00|overall=4 |season=4 |title=19 |director=15 |writer=18 |airdate=14 |prodcode=6 |episodes=\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=\u2013\n |EpisodeNumber2=\u2013\n |Title=''[[Babylon 5: In the Beginning]]''\n |DirectedBy=[[Michael Vejar]]\n |WrittenBy = [[J.
