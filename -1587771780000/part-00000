He was a son of Tasciovanus and succeeded his father in the early first century, reigning until c. 40 CE. His first capital was Verulamium (St Albans) but he subsequently moved it to Colchester. Though his power base ws the Catuvellauni and the Trinovantes, his influence extended over a wide area, and his coins, of high quality, are found in north-east Kent, north Berkshire, Bedfordshire and in Cambridgeshire. Most of them carry on the obverse an ear of corn. Geoffrey de Monmouth, not the most reliable of sources, claimed that he was brought up by Augustus Caesar and Suetonius called him \u2018Rex Brittonorum\u2019. He seems to have been assertive in Britain but took care not to antagonise the Romans. A quarrel with his son Adminus, however, may have given the emperor Claudius the pretext for an expedition, which arrived in 43 AD, afrer Cunobelinus\u2019s death.In Shakespeare\u2019s Cymbeline the historical background, borrowed mainlyfrom Holinshed, is sketched in lightly.

Though his power base ws the Catuvellauni and the Trinovantes, his influence extended over a wide area, and his coins, of high quality, are found in north-east Kent, north Berkshire, Bedfordshire and in Cambridgeshire.

The Lakers would beat the Celtics 112-104.\n\n===2010s: Roles reversed===\nBoth the Celtics and Lakers missed the playoffs in the [[2013\u201314 NBA season|2013\u201314 season]], marking only the second time it has happened in the rivalry's history.  With the [[New York Knicks]] also failing to make the playoffs that season, it marked the first time in NBA history that neither the Celtics, Lakers nor the Knicks qualified for the playoffs in the same season.\n\nBut while the Celtics were able to return to the playoffs over the next three seasons and even made the Eastern Conference Finals in [[2017 NBA playoffs|2017]] and [[2018 NBA playoffs|2018]], the Lakers found themselves in a lengthy rebuilding process. Prior to 2014, the Lakers only missed the playoffs four times since moving to Los Angeles, and five times in franchise history.  However, the Lakers proceeded to miss the playoffs a record six consecutive seasons, highlighted by four straight seasons with over 50 losses and a franchise-low 17\u201365 mark during the [[2015\u201316 NBA season|2015\u201316 season]].\n\nNevertheless, the rivalry between the Celtics and the Lakers remained fairly even during this recent period, with the two teams managing a split in the season series four of the last six times. However, battles between the Celtics and the Lakers took a back seat to the emerging [[Cavaliers\u2013Warriors rivalry|rivalry]] between the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] and the [[Golden State Warriors]], who met in four consecutive NBA Finals between 2015 and 2018, where the Cavaliers were led by a big three of [[LeBron James]], [[Kyrie Irving]], and [[Kevin Love]], while the Warriors were led by a big four of [[Stephen Curry]], [[Kevin Durant]], [[Klay Thompson]], and [[Draymond Green]].\n\nNotwithstanding the Celtics' success and the Lakers' struggles during this period, both teams would make their presence felt in subsequent offseasons. The Lakers' run of futility rewarded them with several high first-round picks ([[D'Angelo Russell]], [[Brandon Ingram]] and [[Lonzo Ball]] were selected second overall), while the Celtics benefited from the [[Brooklyn Nets]]' ill-fated 2013 trade for Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett with their top-three selections of [[Jaylen Brown]] and [[Jayson Tatum]]. In addition, the Celtics went on to sign All-Star free agents [[Al Horford]] and [[Gordon Hayward]] in addition to acquiring Kyrie Irving from the Cavaliers. The Lakers would counter by signing LeBron James in the 2018 offseason. The two teams continued to retool in the 2019 offseason; the Lakers acquired [[Anthony Davis]] from the [[New Orleans Pelicans]] while the Celtics brought in [[Kemba Walker]] after Irving left to join the Nets.\n\n==Finals summaries==\n===1959 NBA Finals===\n{{Main|1959 NBA Finals}}\nThis was the first NBA Finals series between the Lakers and the Celtics, and the only such meeting to occur while the Lakers were still in Minneapolis.

Boston would face a tough seven-game series against the [[Syracuse Nationals]] but would eventually emerge victorious, leading Celtic star [[Bob Cousy]] to predict that Boston would sweep Minneapolis.

The Celtics won Game 1, and the two teams would alternate victories through Game 5.  Game 5 was notable for an impressive Lakers' comeback sending it into overtime, but the Celtics would ultimately win that game. In Game 6, the Celtics closed out the Lakers in convincing fashion with a 124\u2013109 victory.<ref name=1968Finals/>\n\n===1969 NBA Finals===\n{{Main|1969 NBA Finals}}\nWith Bill Russell and Sam Jones in their final season, and plagued with injuries, the Celtics struggled to make the NBA playoffs as the fourth and final seed in the Eastern Conference.

However, they won Game 3 and a buzzer-beater by Sam Jones tied the series up at two games apiece. The home team won Games 5 and 6 which set up a dramatic seventh game. Before the game started, Laker's owner [[Jack Kent Cooke]] placed flyers in every seat stating \"When, not if, the Lakers win the title, balloons will be released from the raftors, the USC marching band will play \"[[Happy Days Are Here Again]]\" and broadcaster Chick Hearn will interview Elgin Baylor, Jerry West and Wilt Chamberlain in that order.\"<ref name=heller>{{cite news|last=Heller |first=Dick |title=Cookin' with Cook |date=June 10, 2008 |newspaper=[[The Washington Times]] |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/jun/10/dick-heller-cooke-got-celtics-cookin/print/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018122202/http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/jun/10/dick-heller-cooke-got-celtics-cookin/print/ |archivedate=October 18, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Before the game, the Celtics circulated in their locker room a memo about the Lakers' celebration plans.<ref name=lazenby>{{cite book |last=Lazenby |first=Roland |authorlink=Roland Lazenby |title=The show: The Inside Story of the Spectacular Los Angeles Lakers in the Words of Those Who Lived It |year=2006 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-07-143034-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/showinsidestoryo00laze/page/121 121]\u2013122 |url=https://archive.org/details/showinsidestoryo00laze |url-access=registration |quote=the show roland lazenby. |accessdate=March 19, 2011}}</ref> Russell noted the giant net hanging from the ceiling during pregame warmups and said to West, \"Those [expletive deleted] balloons are staying up there.\"<ref name=heller/> West was furious at the balloons for providing the Celtics extra motivation.<ref name=lazenby/>\n\nBoston played tough through the first half and would keep the game close, with a score of 60\u201360. Remarkably, Boston would pull away and entered the fourth quarter up by 18. It seemed to be over when Lakers center Wilt Chamberlain was injured and replaced by reserve [[Mel Counts]]. The Celtics, however, would begin to show their age when they began missing shots and turning the ball over and Laker Jerry West pulled L.A. to within one. Despite having numerous opportunities, the Lakers couldn't get over the hump and Don Nelson would make an incredible foul-line jump-shot which bounced off the back iron and fell in. During this, another battle was heating up off the court between Jack Kent Cooke and Lakers coach Butch Van Breda Kolff. Chamberlain was pleading for Breda Kolff to put him back in, but he refused.

The Lakers would beat the Celtics 112-104.\n\n===2010s: Roles reversed===\nBoth the Celtics and Lakers missed the playoffs in the [[2013\u201314 NBA season|2013\u201314 season]], marking only the second time it has happened in the rivalry's history.  With the [[New York Knicks]] also failing to make the playoffs that season, it marked the first time in NBA history that neither the Celtics, Lakers nor the Knicks qualified for the playoffs in the same season.\n\nBut while the Celtics were able to return to the playoffs over the next three seasons and even made the Eastern Conference Finals in [[2017 NBA playoffs|2017]] and [[2018 NBA playoffs|2018]], the Lakers found themselves in a lengthy rebuilding process. Prior to 2014, the Lakers only missed the playoffs four times since moving to Los Angeles, and five times in franchise history.  However, the Lakers proceeded to miss the playoffs a record six consecutive seasons, highlighted by four straight seasons with over 50 losses and a franchise-low 17\u201365 mark during the [[2015\u201316 NBA season|2015\u201316 season]].\n\nNevertheless, the rivalry between the Celtics and the Lakers remained fairly even during this recent period, with the two teams managing a split in the season series four of the last six times. However, battles between the Celtics and the Lakers took a back seat to the emerging [[Cavaliers\u2013Warriors rivalry|rivalry]] between the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] and the [[Golden State Warriors]], who met in four consecutive NBA Finals between 2015 and 2018, where the Cavaliers were led by a big three of [[LeBron James]], [[Kyrie Irving]], and [[Kevin Love]], while the Warriors were led by a big four of [[Stephen Curry]], [[Kevin Durant]], [[Klay Thompson]], and [[Draymond Green]].\n\nNotwithstanding the Celtics' success and the Lakers' struggles during this period, both teams would make their presence felt in subsequent offseasons. The Lakers' run of futility rewarded them with several high first-round picks ([[D'Angelo Russell]], [[Brandon Ingram]] and [[Lonzo Ball]] were selected second overall), while the Celtics benefited from the [[Brooklyn Nets]]' ill-fated 2013 trade for Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett with their top-three selections of [[Jaylen Brown]] and [[Jayson Tatum]]. In addition, the Celtics went on to sign All-Star free agents [[Al Horford]] and [[Gordon Hayward]] in addition to acquiring Kyrie Irving from the Cavaliers. The Lakers would counter by signing LeBron James in the 2018 offseason. The two teams continued to retool in the 2019 offseason; the Lakers acquired [[Anthony Davis]] from the [[New Orleans Pelicans]] while the Celtics brought in [[Kemba Walker]] after Irving left to join the Nets.\n\n==Finals summaries==\n===1959 NBA Finals===\n{{Main|1959 NBA Finals}}\nThis was the first NBA Finals series between the Lakers and the Celtics, and the only such meeting to occur while the Lakers were still in Minneapolis.

The Celtics won Game 1, and the two teams would alternate victories through Game 5.

Remarkably, Boston would pull away and entered the fourth quarter up by 18. It seemed to be over when Lakers center Wilt Chamberlain was injured and replaced by reserve [[Mel Counts]]. The Celtics, however, would begin to show their age when they began missing shots and turning the ball over and Laker Jerry West pulled L.A. to within one. Despite having numerous opportunities, the Lakers couldn't get over the hump and Don Nelson would make an incredible foul-line jump-shot which bounced off the back iron and fell in. During this, another battle was heating up off the court between Jack Kent Cooke and Lakers coach Butch Van Breda Kolff. Chamberlain was pleading for Breda Kolff to put him back in, but he refused.

He served as an aide to [[Nathanael Greene]] during the [[Siege of Boston]], participated in the placing of guns on the [[Fortification of Dorchester Heights|Dorchester Heights]] in March 1776, and following the British abandonment of Boston, went with the rest of the Continental Army to New York where he left Greene's staff and was given command of an infantry company.\n\nSent to Canada as part of the reinforcements for [[Benedict Arnold]]'s army besieging Quebec, he arrived just in time to witness the arrival of 8,000 British reinforcements under General [[John Burgoyne]] \u2013 which precipitated the collapse of the American effort in Canada. He became aide to Arnold just prior to the final retreat and left Canada with Arnold on the very last boat out. Shortly thereafter, he left Arnold's service and became an aide to General [[Horatio Gates]] in August 1776.\n\nWhen Gates sent him to Congress with official dispatches about the victory at the [[Battle of Saratoga]] in 1777, Wilkinson kept Congress waiting while he attended to personal affairs. When he finally showed up, he embellished his own role in the victory, and was [[brevet (military)|brevetted]] as a [[brigadier general]] (despite being only 20 years old at the time) on November 6, 1777, and appointed to the newly created Board of War. The promotion over more senior colonels caused an uproar among Continental officers, especially because Wilkinson's gossiping seemed to indicate he was a participant in the [[Conway Cabal]], a conspiracy to replace [[George Washington]] with Horatio Gates as commander-in-chief of the [[Continental Army]]. Gates soon had enough of Wilkinson, and the young officer was compelled to resign in March 1778. On July 29, 1779, Congress appointed him clothier-general of the Army, but he resigned on March 27, 1781, due to his \"lack of aptitude for the job\".<ref name=\"Linklater\"/>{{rp|68}}\n\n==Kentucky ventures==\nAfter his resignation from the Continental Army, Wilkinson reluctantly became a [[brigadier general]] in the [[Pennsylvania militia]] in 1782 and also a state assemblyman in 1783, due to the wishes of George Washington.<ref name=\"Linklater\"/>{{rp|62}} He moved to [[Kentucky]] (at that time, just three counties still belonging to Virginia)  in 1784, and he was active there in efforts to achieve independence from [[Virginia]].\n\nIn April 1787, Wilkinson made a highly controversial trip to [[New Orleans]], which was the capital of [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Spanish colonial Louisiana]].<ref name=\"Linklater\" />{{rp|80}} At that time, Americans were allowed to trade on the [[Mississippi River]], but they had to pay a hefty [[tariff]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Slaughter|first=Thomas|title=The Whiskey Rebellion|year=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=55}}</ref>  Wilkinson met with Spanish Governor [[Esteban Rodr\u00edguez Mir\u00f3]] and managed to convince him to allow Kentucky to have a trading monopoly on the River; in return he promised to promote Spanish interests in the west.<ref>Buescher, John. \"[http://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/24290 Trailing Lewis and Clark]\".

Kentucky had very nearly achieved statehood under the old [[Articles of Confederation]], and there was widespread disappointment when this was delayed because of the new constitution.\n\nLeading up to Kentucky's seventh convention regarding separation from Virginia in November 1788, Wilkinson attempted to gauge the support for Kentucky to seek union with Spain. Wilkinson's ability to win people over with his charm and sincerity got him elected committee chairman at the convention. He advocated for Kentucky to seek independence from Virginia first, and then to consider joining the [[United States|Union of states]] as a second step. For many, joining the Union was conditional upon the Union negotiating with Spain to arrange free navigation on the Mississippi River, a contentious point which many doubted the eastern states would act upon.\n\nUnable to gather enough support for his position at the convention, Wilkinson then approached Mir\u00f3 with a proposal. His intention was to obtain a [[Land grant|grant]] of 60,000 acres (243&nbsp;km\u00b2) in the [[Yazoo lands]], at the junction of the [[Yazoo River]] and the Mississippi (near present-day [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]]). The land was to serve as payment for Wilkinson's efforts on behalf of Spain, and to serve as a refuge in the event he and his supporters had to flee from the United States. Wilkinson asked for and received a pension of $7,000 from Mir\u00f3, while requesting pensions on behalf of several prominent Kentuckians, including: [[Harry Innes]], [[Benjamin Sebastian]], [[John Brown (Kentucky)|John Brown]], [[Caleb Wallace]], [[Benjamin Logan]], [[Isaac Shelby]], [[George Muter]], [[George Nicholas]], and even [[Humphrey Marshall (Senator)|Humphrey Marshall]] (who at one time was a bitter rival of Wilkinson's).\n\nHowever, by 1788 Wilkinson had apparently lost the confidence of officials in [[Spain]]. Mir\u00f3 was not to grant any of the proposed pensions and was forbidden from giving money to support a revolution in Kentucky. Furthermore, Wilkinson continued to secretly receive funds from Spain for many years.\n\n==Second military career==\n{{Wikisource|Lieut. Colonel-commandant Wilkinson's Report, August 24, 1791}}\nIn the [[Northwest Indian War]], Colonel Wilkinson led a force of Kentucky [[Military volunteer|volunteers]] against [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] at [[Ouiatenon]] in May 1791. He commanded a follow-up [[Raid (military)|raid]] that autumn, highlighted by the [[Battle of Kenapacomaqua]]. In October he received a [[Officer (armed forces)|commission]] in the [[U.S. Army]] as lieutenant colonel, commandant of the [[1st Infantry Regiment (United States)#Origins|2nd U.S. Infantry]].\n\n===Rivalry with Wayne===\nWhen the United States government reorganized the Army as the [[Legion of the United States]], President George Washington was faced with the decision of whom to name as its commanding general. The two major candidates for this promotion were Wilkinson and [[Anthony Wayne]]. In the end, the cabinet chose Wayne due to Wilkinson's suspected involvement with the Spanish government. The cabinet promoted Wilkinson to brigadier general as consolation, since the President was aware of Wilkinson's fragile ego.\n\nWilkinson developed a jealousy of Wayne, but he maintained an ostensible respect toward the general. However, upon Wilkinson's refusal of an invitation to Wayne's Christmas party, Wayne developed a full-fledged hatred for Wilkinson, deeming the refusal to be an act of disrespect. For example, Wayne had led the Legion Army against the Native Americans in the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] in August 1794. This battle was a huge victory for the United States, yet Wilkinson had criticized General Wayne's actions during the battle, simply to antagonize him.\n\nWilkinson proceeded to file formal complaints with President Washington, against Wayne and his decisions. Upon finding out about the complaints against him, Wayne decided to fight back, launching an investigation into Wilkinson's history with the Spanish. During all of this time, Wilkinson had renewed his secret alliance with the Spanish government (through the Governor of Louisiana [[Francisco Luis H\u00e9ctor de Carondelet]]), alerting them to the actions of both the US and the French occupancy in North America. When Spanish couriers were intercepted carrying payments for Wilkinson, Wayne's suspicions were confirmed and he attempted to [[court martial]] Wilkinson for his treachery. However, Wayne developed a stomach ulcer and died on December 15, 1796; there was no court-martial. Instead Wilkinson began his first tenure as [[Commanding General of the United States Army|Senior Officer of the Army]], which lasted for about a year and a half. He continued to pass on intelligence to them in return for large sums in gold, but most of his information was of little value.<ref name=\"Nelson, 1999\">Nelson, 1999</ref>\n\n===Quasi-War with France===\nWilkinson was transferred to the southern frontier in 1798. During the [[Quasi-War]] crisis of the late 1790s between [[French First Republic|France]] and the United States, he was given the third-place rank in the U.S. Army behind [[George Washington]] (who, having been succeeded as President by [[John Adams|Adams]], died in December 1799) and [[Alexander Hamilton]]. Among other duties, Wilkinson was charged by Hamilton with establishing a \"Reserve Corps\" of American troops in the lower Ohio River Valley, who would seize the lower Mississippi River Valley and New Orleans in the event of war with France and her ally Spain.\n\nDespite the end of the crisis in mid-1800 and Hamilton being discharged from the Army, Wilkinson, for unknown reasons, continued the plan for the establishment of the base which he named \"Cantonment Wilkinson\" after himself. Located in the [[Indiana Territory]] (now southern [[Illinois]]), the base operated from January 1801 to late 1802 before finally being abandoned. Archaeologists from [[Southern Illinois University]] have located the remains of this base, which is producing much previously-unknown information and artifacts from the daily life of the frontier army.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cantonment Wilkinson (Helm) Site, Pulaski County, Illinois |url=https://sites.google.com/site/southernmostil/home/explorers/cantonment-wilkinsonville |accessdate=2010-07-15 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723041340/https://sites.google.com/site/southernmostil/home/explorers/cantonment-wilkinsonville |archivedate=2015-07-23 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.southernmostillinoishistory.net/wilkinsonville.htm \"Ohio River Valley Forts: Cantonment Wilkinsonville\", ''Southernmost Illinois History''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802234937/http://www.southernmostillinoishistory.net/wilkinsonville.htm |date=2010-08-02 }}</ref>\n\nWilkinson served his second, longer term as [[Commanding General of the United States Army|Senior Officer of the Army]] from June 15, 1800, until January 27, 1812, when former Secretary of War [[Henry Dearborn]] was promoted to [[major general]] over Wilkinson.\n\n===Service under President Jefferson===\nWilkinson remained senior officer of the United States Army under President [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Along with Governor [[William C. C. Claiborne]], Wilkinson shared the honor of taking possession of the [[Louisiana Purchase]] on behalf of the United States in 1803. At this time, Wilkinson renewed his treasonous relationship with Spanish colonial officials, offering advice to them on how to contain American expansion in exchange for the restoration of his pension. Among other things, Wilkinson tipped off the Spanish to the object of the [[Lewis and Clark expedition]] and provided advice to the [[Sebasti\u00e1n Calvo de la Puerta, 1st Marquess of Casa Calvo|Marquess of Casa Calvo]] to aid in his negotiations over the Texas\u2013Louisiana border.<ref name=\"Cox1914\">{{cite journal|title=General Wilkinson and His Later Intrigues With the Spaniards|last=Cox|first=Isaac Joslin|date=July 1914|journal=American Historical Review|volume=XIX|issue=4|pages=794\u2013812|url=https://archive.org/details/generalwilkinson01coxi/}}</ref>\n\n===Connections with Aaron Burr===\nIn 1804\u201305, he met in person with [[Aaron Burr]] and they exchanged letters regarding [[Burr conspiracy|Burr's conspiracy]].  After Burr's arrest he claimed he was leading a group of settlers to take up residence on land in Texas which he had leased from the Spanish government in Mexico, while the government charged him with treason and claimed he intended to separate the then-western states and territories from the United States and establish an independent nation.\n\nWilkinson was both the senior brigadier general of the United States Army and the first [[List of Governors of Missouri|Governor of Louisiana Territory]], which made him someone whose support Burr would cultivate. In 1806 Burr is supposed to have sent a coded, unsigned letter (the \"Cipher Letter\", which Burr later denied having written) to Wilkinson, which stated that he was ready to commence his movement to Texas.  Burr's subsequent efforts to recruit participants in his plans became public, raising fears that he was conspiring with England to start a war with Spain.  Wilkinson became fearful that his role in Burr's plans and/or his spying for Spain would be exposed.  In October 1806 Wilkinson sent to President Jefferson a letter in which he painted Burr's actions in the worst possible light, while portraying himself as innocent of any involvement. Jefferson ordered Burr's arrest, and Burr was apprehended near [[Natchez, Mississippi]].\n\nWilkinson testified at Burr's trial, and the documents presented as evidence included the \"cipher letter\", which Wilkinson had given the prosecution.  However the letter was clearly altered to minimize Wilkinson's culpability.  This forgery, coupled with Wilkinson's obviously self-serving testimony, had the effect of making Burr seem to be the victim of an overzealous government.  The grand jury nearly produced enough votes in favor of indicting Wilkinson for [[misprision of treason]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Harris |first1=Matthew L. |last2=Buckley |first2=Jay H. |date=2012 |title=Zebulon Pike, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Txq4Oh2NjTQC&pg=PA213 |location=Norman, OK |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |page=213 |isbn=978-0-8061-4243-2}}</ref> and foreman [[John Randolph of Roanoke|John Randolph]] said of Wilkinson that he was a \"mammoth of iniquity\", the \"most finished scoundrel\", and \"the only man I ever saw who was from the bark to the very core a villain.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Isenberg |first=Nancy |date=2004 |title=Beyond the Founders: New Approaches to the Political History of the Early American Republic |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UBS8JwARKdkC&pg=PA148 |location=Chapel Hill, NC |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |page=148 |isbn=978-0-8078-2889-2}}</ref>\n\nDuring Burr's trial, Wilkinson placed New Orleans under martial law, against the will of [[William C. C. Claiborne|Governor Claiborne]],<ref>https://www.britannica.com/biography/James-Wilkinson</ref> and imprisoned several people whom he thought may be able to connect him to Burr, along with attorneys who tried to defend them.<ref>https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/founding-traitor/</ref>\n\nHe was removed from the Territorial Governor's office after being publicly criticized for heavy-handed administration and abuse of power (and replaced with [[Meriwether Lewis]]). In addition, his actions around the Burr conspiracy became public, which aroused the public against him and led to two Congressional inquiries into his private ventures and intrigues.  President [[James Madison]], who had succeeded Jefferson in 1809, ordered a military court of inquiry in 1811, which resulted in a [[court-martial]] that exonerated Wilkinson.<ref name=\"Nelson, 1999\"/>\n\n===War of 1812===\nWilkinson was commissioned a [[Major general (United States)|major general]] during the [[War of 1812]] on March 2, 1813. That same month, Wilkinson led the American force which occupied [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] in [[Spanish West Florida]], effectively implementing the inclusion of the [[Mobile District]] in the [[Mississippi Territory]].\n\nHe was then assigned to the [[St. Lawrence River]] [[Theater (warfare)|theater of war]], following [[Henry Dearborn]]'s reassignment. Wilkinson engaged in two failed campaigns (the [[Battle of Crysler's Farm]] and the second [[Battle of Lacolle Mills (1814)|Battle of Lacolle Mills]]). He was then relieved from active duty, but he was cleared in a military inquiry. He was discharged from the Army on June 15, 1815. In 1816, Wilkinson published ''Memoirs of My Own Times'', in a final attempt to clear his name.\n\n==Last years==\nAfter the end of his military career, Wilkinson was appointed as [[U.S. Ambassador to Mexico|U.S. Envoy to Mexico]]. This was during the period of the [[Mexican War of Independence]] against Spain, which was won in 1821. In that year, Wilkinson requested a [[Mexican Texas|Texas]] land grant. While awaiting the Mexican government's approval of his land scheme, Wilkinson died in [[Mexico City]] on December 28, 1825, at the age of 68.  He was buried in Mexico City.<ref name=\"Joseph2007\" />\n\nWilkinson's involvement with the Spanish (as Agent 13) was widely suspected in his own day, but it was not proven until 1854, with Louisiana historian [[Charles Gayarr\u00e9]]'s publication of the American general's correspondence with [[Esteban Rodr\u00edguez Mir\u00f3]], [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Louisiana]]'s colonial governor between 1785 and 1791. Other historians subsequently added to the catalog of Wilkinson's treasonous activities.\n\n==Later view==\nSome 65 years after the general's misdeeds, then-Governor of [[New York (state)|New York]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] condemned him in print: \"In all our history, there is no more despicable character.\"<ref name=\"Stewart\"/>  Historian [[Robert Leckie (author)|Robert Leckie]] characterized him as \"a general who never won a battle or lost a [[court-martial]]\", while [[Frederick Jackson Turner]] called Wilkinson \"the most consummate artist in treason that the nation ever possessed\".  [[George Rogers Clark]] biographer [[Temple Bodley]] said of Wilkinson, \"He had considerable military talent, but used it only for his own gain.\"\n\n==Legacy==\n* [[Frankfort, Kentucky]]'s downtown was created from land owned by Wilkinson, and he designed the layout. A major street, which runs along historic [[Liberty Hall (Frankfort, Kentucky)|Liberty Hall]], was named Wilkinson Street.<ref>[http://www.frankfort.ky.gov/frankfort-history.html Frankfort.ky.gov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101108011812/http://www.frankfort.ky.gov/frankfort-history.html |date=2010-11-08 }}</ref>\n* [[New Orleans]] has a short street called Wilkinson named for James Wilkinson, in the [[French Quarter]] near [[Jackson Square, New Orleans|Jackson Square]].<ref>{{cite book | author=Elaine Lacoste | title= Street Names & Picayune Histories of New Orleans|publisher=Ho'olauna Hawaii, Ltd.|year=1997}} {{ISBN|0-9656409-0-6}}</ref> There is also a Wilkinson Street in [[Mandeville, Louisiana]]. Many of the oldest streets in Mandeville, close to [[Lake Pontchartrain]], are named after prominent New Orleans residents of the late 18th and early 19th centuries or for [[Battle of New Orleans]] heroes.\n* [[Wilkinson County, Georgia]], is named for Wilkinson. A Georgia historical marker on the courthouse square gives a brief biography of the general and identifies him as the source of the county's name. (The entry on the county in the usually reliable reference ''Georgia Place Names'', by the late Kenneth Krakow, confuses James Wilkinson with James Marion Wilkinson, a [[Valdosta, Georgia]], politician and railroad executive, but the latter Wilkinson was born decades after the county was founded.)\n* [[Wilkinson County, Mississippi]], is named for General Wilkinson as well. It was there in the Old Natchez District that Wilkinson spent much of his time, allegedly plotting the Burr Conspiracy; [[Fort Adams, Mississippi|Fort Adams]] (then an important [[U.S. Army]] post) was constructed by Wilkinson as the most southwesterly point in the U.S. and the last American stop on the [[Mississippi River]] before entering [[New Spain|Spanish]] territory.\n* Wilkinson was an avid supporter of the military's short-hair codes. He attempted to prosecute Colonel [[Thomas Butler (soldier)|Thomas Butler]], a veteran of both the Revolution and the Indian wars, for keeping his long hair. Colonel Butler died before the trials closed. He never did cut his long, braided queue prior to his death and a possibly apocryphal story tells that his last request was for a hole to be drilled in his casket so that the queue could hang out and taunt Wilkinson even in death.<ref>Hickey, Donald R.  \"The United States Army Versus Long Hair: The Trials of Colonel Thomas Butler, 1801\u20131805\", Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography 101 (October 1977): 462\u201374 (in print F146.

He served as an aide to [[Nathanael Greene]] during the [[Siege of Boston]], participated in the placing of guns on the [[Fortification of Dorchester Heights|Dorchester Heights]] in March 1776, and following the British abandonment of Boston, went with the rest of the Continental Army to New York where he left Greene's staff and was given command of an infantry company.\n\nSent to Canada as part of the reinforcements for [[Benedict Arnold]]'s army besieging Quebec, he arrived just in time to witness the arrival of 8,000 British reinforcements under General [[John Burgoyne]] \u2013 which precipitated the collapse of the American effort in Canada. He became aide to Arnold just prior to the final retreat and left Canada with Arnold on the very last boat out. Shortly thereafter, he left Arnold's service and became an aide to General [[Horatio Gates]] in August 1776.\n\nWhen Gates sent him to Congress with official dispatches about the victory at the [[Battle of Saratoga]] in 1777, Wilkinson kept Congress waiting while he attended to personal affairs. When he finally showed up, he embellished his own role in the victory, and was [[brevet (military)|brevetted]] as a [[brigadier general]] (despite being only 20 years old at the time) on November 6, 1777, and appointed to the newly created Board of War. The promotion over more senior colonels caused an uproar among Continental officers, especially because Wilkinson's gossiping seemed to indicate he was a participant in the [[Conway Cabal]], a conspiracy to replace [[George Washington]] with Horatio Gates as commander-in-chief of the [[Continental Army]]. Gates soon had enough of Wilkinson, and the young officer was compelled to resign in March 1778. On July 29, 1779, Congress appointed him clothier-general of the Army, but he resigned on March 27, 1781, due to his \"lack of aptitude for the job\".<ref name=\"Linklater\"/>{{rp|68}}\n\n==Kentucky ventures==\nAfter his resignation from the Continental Army, Wilkinson reluctantly became a [[brigadier general]] in the [[Pennsylvania militia]] in 1782 and also a state assemblyman in 1783, due to the wishes of George Washington.<ref name=\"Linklater\"/>{{rp|62}} He moved to [[Kentucky]] (at that time, just three counties still belonging to Virginia)  in 1784, and he was active there in efforts to achieve independence from [[Virginia]].\n\nIn April 1787, Wilkinson made a highly controversial trip to [[New Orleans]], which was the capital of [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Spanish colonial Louisiana]].<ref name=\"Linklater\" />{{rp|80}} At that time, Americans were allowed to trade on the [[Mississippi River]], but they had to pay a hefty [[tariff]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Slaughter|first=Thomas|title=The Whiskey Rebellion|year=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=55}}</ref>  Wilkinson met with Spanish Governor [[Esteban Rodr\u00edguez Mir\u00f3]] and managed to convince him to allow Kentucky to have a trading monopoly on the River; in return he promised to promote Spanish interests in the west.<ref>Buescher, John. \"[http://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/24290 Trailing Lewis and Clark]\".

Kentucky had very nearly achieved statehood under the old [[Articles of Confederation]], and there was widespread disappointment when this was delayed because of the new constitution.\n\nLeading up to Kentucky's seventh convention regarding separation from Virginia in November 1788, Wilkinson attempted to gauge the support for Kentucky to seek union with Spain. Wilkinson's ability to win people over with his charm and sincerity got him elected committee chairman at the convention. He advocated for Kentucky to seek independence from Virginia first, and then to consider joining the [[United States|Union of states]] as a second step. For many, joining the Union was conditional upon the Union negotiating with Spain to arrange free navigation on the Mississippi River, a contentious point which many doubted the eastern states would act upon.\n\nUnable to gather enough support for his position at the convention, Wilkinson then approached Mir\u00f3 with a proposal. His intention was to obtain a [[Land grant|grant]] of 60,000 acres (243&nbsp;km\u00b2) in the [[Yazoo lands]], at the junction of the [[Yazoo River]] and the Mississippi (near present-day [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]]). The land was to serve as payment for Wilkinson's efforts on behalf of Spain, and to serve as a refuge in the event he and his supporters had to flee from the United States. Wilkinson asked for and received a pension of $7,000 from Mir\u00f3, while requesting pensions on behalf of several prominent Kentuckians, including: [[Harry Innes]], [[Benjamin Sebastian]], [[John Brown (Kentucky)|John Brown]], [[Caleb Wallace]], [[Benjamin Logan]], [[Isaac Shelby]], [[George Muter]], [[George Nicholas]], and even [[Humphrey Marshall (Senator)|Humphrey Marshall]] (who at one time was a bitter rival of Wilkinson's).\n\nHowever, by 1788 Wilkinson had apparently lost the confidence of officials in [[Spain]]. Mir\u00f3 was not to grant any of the proposed pensions and was forbidden from giving money to support a revolution in Kentucky. Furthermore, Wilkinson continued to secretly receive funds from Spain for many years.\n\n==Second military career==\n{{Wikisource|Lieut. Colonel-commandant Wilkinson's Report, August 24, 1791}}\nIn the [[Northwest Indian War]], Colonel Wilkinson led a force of Kentucky [[Military volunteer|volunteers]] against [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] at [[Ouiatenon]] in May 1791. He commanded a follow-up [[Raid (military)|raid]] that autumn, highlighted by the [[Battle of Kenapacomaqua]]. In October he received a [[Officer (armed forces)|commission]] in the [[U.S. Army]] as lieutenant colonel, commandant of the [[1st Infantry Regiment (United States)#Origins|2nd U.S. Infantry]].\n\n===Rivalry with Wayne===\nWhen the United States government reorganized the Army as the [[Legion of the United States]], President George Washington was faced with the decision of whom to name as its commanding general. The two major candidates for this promotion were Wilkinson and [[Anthony Wayne]]. In the end, the cabinet chose Wayne due to Wilkinson's suspected involvement with the Spanish government. The cabinet promoted Wilkinson to brigadier general as consolation, since the President was aware of Wilkinson's fragile ego.\n\nWilkinson developed a jealousy of Wayne, but he maintained an ostensible respect toward the general. However, upon Wilkinson's refusal of an invitation to Wayne's Christmas party, Wayne developed a full-fledged hatred for Wilkinson, deeming the refusal to be an act of disrespect. For example, Wayne had led the Legion Army against the Native Americans in the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] in August 1794. This battle was a huge victory for the United States, yet Wilkinson had criticized General Wayne's actions during the battle, simply to antagonize him.\n\nWilkinson proceeded to file formal complaints with President Washington, against Wayne and his decisions. Upon finding out about the complaints against him, Wayne decided to fight back, launching an investigation into Wilkinson's history with the Spanish. During all of this time, Wilkinson had renewed his secret alliance with the Spanish government (through the Governor of Louisiana [[Francisco Luis H\u00e9ctor de Carondelet]]), alerting them to the actions of both the US and the French occupancy in North America. When Spanish couriers were intercepted carrying payments for Wilkinson, Wayne's suspicions were confirmed and he attempted to [[court martial]] Wilkinson for his treachery. However, Wayne developed a stomach ulcer and died on December 15, 1796; there was no court-martial. Instead Wilkinson began his first tenure as [[Commanding General of the United States Army|Senior Officer of the Army]], which lasted for about a year and a half. He continued to pass on intelligence to them in return for large sums in gold, but most of his information was of little value.<ref name=\"Nelson, 1999\">Nelson, 1999</ref>\n\n===Quasi-War with France===\nWilkinson was transferred to the southern frontier in 1798. During the [[Quasi-War]] crisis of the late 1790s between [[French First Republic|France]] and the United States, he was given the third-place rank in the U.S. Army behind [[George Washington]] (who, having been succeeded as President by [[John Adams|Adams]], died in December 1799) and [[Alexander Hamilton]]. Among other duties, Wilkinson was charged by Hamilton with establishing a \"Reserve Corps\" of American troops in the lower Ohio River Valley, who would seize the lower Mississippi River Valley and New Orleans in the event of war with France and her ally Spain.\n\nDespite the end of the crisis in mid-1800 and Hamilton being discharged from the Army, Wilkinson, for unknown reasons, continued the plan for the establishment of the base which he named \"Cantonment Wilkinson\" after himself. Located in the [[Indiana Territory]] (now southern [[Illinois]]), the base operated from January 1801 to late 1802 before finally being abandoned. Archaeologists from [[Southern Illinois University]] have located the remains of this base, which is producing much previously-unknown information and artifacts from the daily life of the frontier army.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cantonment Wilkinson (Helm) Site, Pulaski County, Illinois |url=https://sites.google.com/site/southernmostil/home/explorers/cantonment-wilkinsonville |accessdate=2010-07-15 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723041340/https://sites.google.com/site/southernmostil/home/explorers/cantonment-wilkinsonville |archivedate=2015-07-23 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.southernmostillinoishistory.net/wilkinsonville.htm \"Ohio River Valley Forts: Cantonment Wilkinsonville\", ''Southernmost Illinois History''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802234937/http://www.southernmostillinoishistory.net/wilkinsonville.htm |date=2010-08-02 }}</ref>\n\nWilkinson served his second, longer term as [[Commanding General of the United States Army|Senior Officer of the Army]] from June 15, 1800, until January 27, 1812, when former Secretary of War [[Henry Dearborn]] was promoted to [[major general]] over Wilkinson.\n\n===Service under President Jefferson===\nWilkinson remained senior officer of the United States Army under President [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Along with Governor [[William C. C. Claiborne]], Wilkinson shared the honor of taking possession of the [[Louisiana Purchase]] on behalf of the United States in 1803. At this time, Wilkinson renewed his treasonous relationship with Spanish colonial officials, offering advice to them on how to contain American expansion in exchange for the restoration of his pension. Among other things, Wilkinson tipped off the Spanish to the object of the [[Lewis and Clark expedition]] and provided advice to the [[Sebasti\u00e1n Calvo de la Puerta, 1st Marquess of Casa Calvo|Marquess of Casa Calvo]] to aid in his negotiations over the Texas\u2013Louisiana border.<ref name=\"Cox1914\">{{cite journal|title=General Wilkinson and His Later Intrigues With the Spaniards|last=Cox|first=Isaac Joslin|date=July 1914|journal=American Historical Review|volume=XIX|issue=4|pages=794\u2013812|url=https://archive.org/details/generalwilkinson01coxi/}}</ref>\n\n===Connections with Aaron Burr===\nIn 1804\u201305, he met in person with [[Aaron Burr]] and they exchanged letters regarding [[Burr conspiracy|Burr's conspiracy]].  After Burr's arrest he claimed he was leading a group of settlers to take up residence on land in Texas which he had leased from the Spanish government in Mexico, while the government charged him with treason and claimed he intended to separate the then-western states and territories from the United States and establish an independent nation.\n\nWilkinson was both the senior brigadier general of the United States Army and the first [[List of Governors of Missouri|Governor of Louisiana Territory]], which made him someone whose support Burr would cultivate. In 1806 Burr is supposed to have sent a coded, unsigned letter (the \"Cipher Letter\", which Burr later denied having written) to Wilkinson, which stated that he was ready to commence his movement to Texas.  Burr's subsequent efforts to recruit participants in his plans became public, raising fears that he was conspiring with England to start a war with Spain.  Wilkinson became fearful that his role in Burr's plans and/or his spying for Spain would be exposed.  In October 1806 Wilkinson sent to President Jefferson a letter in which he painted Burr's actions in the worst possible light, while portraying himself as innocent of any involvement. Jefferson ordered Burr's arrest, and Burr was apprehended near [[Natchez, Mississippi]].\n\nWilkinson testified at Burr's trial, and the documents presented as evidence included the \"cipher letter\", which Wilkinson had given the prosecution.  However the letter was clearly altered to minimize Wilkinson's culpability.  This forgery, coupled with Wilkinson's obviously self-serving testimony, had the effect of making Burr seem to be the victim of an overzealous government.  The grand jury nearly produced enough votes in favor of indicting Wilkinson for [[misprision of treason]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Harris |first1=Matthew L. |last2=Buckley |first2=Jay H. |date=2012 |title=Zebulon Pike, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Txq4Oh2NjTQC&pg=PA213 |location=Norman, OK |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |page=213 |isbn=978-0-8061-4243-2}}</ref> and foreman [[John Randolph of Roanoke|John Randolph]] said of Wilkinson that he was a \"mammoth of iniquity\", the \"most finished scoundrel\", and \"the only man I ever saw who was from the bark to the very core a villain.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Isenberg |first=Nancy |date=2004 |title=Beyond the Founders: New Approaches to the Political History of the Early American Republic |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UBS8JwARKdkC&pg=PA148 |location=Chapel Hill, NC |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |page=148 |isbn=978-0-8078-2889-2}}</ref>\n\nDuring Burr's trial, Wilkinson placed New Orleans under martial law, against the will of [[William C. C. Claiborne|Governor Claiborne]],<ref>https://www.britannica.com/biography/James-Wilkinson</ref> and imprisoned several people whom he thought may be able to connect him to Burr, along with attorneys who tried to defend them.<ref>https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/founding-traitor/</ref>\n\nHe was removed from the Territorial Governor's office after being publicly criticized for heavy-handed administration and abuse of power (and replaced with [[Meriwether Lewis]]). In addition, his actions around the Burr conspiracy became public, which aroused the public against him and led to two Congressional inquiries into his private ventures and intrigues.  President [[James Madison]], who had succeeded Jefferson in 1809, ordered a military court of inquiry in 1811, which resulted in a [[court-martial]] that exonerated Wilkinson.<ref name=\"Nelson, 1999\"/>\n\n===War of 1812===\nWilkinson was commissioned a [[Major general (United States)|major general]] during the [[War of 1812]] on March 2, 1813. That same month, Wilkinson led the American force which occupied [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] in [[Spanish West Florida]], effectively implementing the inclusion of the [[Mobile District]] in the [[Mississippi Territory]].\n\nHe was then assigned to the [[St. Lawrence River]] [[Theater (warfare)|theater of war]], following [[Henry Dearborn]]'s reassignment. Wilkinson engaged in two failed campaigns (the [[Battle of Crysler's Farm]] and the second [[Battle of Lacolle Mills (1814)|Battle of Lacolle Mills]]). He was then relieved from active duty, but he was cleared in a military inquiry. He was discharged from the Army on June 15, 1815. In 1816, Wilkinson published ''Memoirs of My Own Times'', in a final attempt to clear his name.\n\n==Last years==\nAfter the end of his military career, Wilkinson was appointed as [[U.S. Ambassador to Mexico|U.S. Envoy to Mexico]]. This was during the period of the [[Mexican War of Independence]] against Spain, which was won in 1821. In that year, Wilkinson requested a [[Mexican Texas|Texas]] land grant. While awaiting the Mexican government's approval of his land scheme, Wilkinson died in [[Mexico City]] on December 28, 1825, at the age of 68.  He was buried in Mexico City.<ref name=\"Joseph2007\" />\n\nWilkinson's involvement with the Spanish (as Agent 13) was widely suspected in his own day, but it was not proven until 1854, with Louisiana historian [[Charles Gayarr\u00e9]]'s publication of the American general's correspondence with [[Esteban Rodr\u00edguez Mir\u00f3]], [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Louisiana]]'s colonial governor between 1785 and 1791. Other historians subsequently added to the catalog of Wilkinson's treasonous activities.\n\n==Later view==\nSome 65 years after the general's misdeeds, then-Governor of [[New York (state)|New York]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] condemned him in print: \"In all our history, there is no more despicable character.\"<ref name=\"Stewart\"/>  Historian [[Robert Leckie (author)|Robert Leckie]] characterized him as \"a general who never won a battle or lost a [[court-martial]]\", while [[Frederick Jackson Turner]] called Wilkinson \"the most consummate artist in treason that the nation ever possessed\".  [[George Rogers Clark]] biographer [[Temple Bodley]] said of Wilkinson, \"He had considerable military talent, but used it only for his own gain.\"\n\n==Legacy==\n* [[Frankfort, Kentucky]]'s downtown was created from land owned by Wilkinson, and he designed the layout. A major street, which runs along historic [[Liberty Hall (Frankfort, Kentucky)|Liberty Hall]], was named Wilkinson Street.<ref>[http://www.frankfort.ky.gov/frankfort-history.html Frankfort.ky.gov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101108011812/http://www.frankfort.ky.gov/frankfort-history.html |date=2010-11-08 }}</ref>\n* [[New Orleans]] has a short street called Wilkinson named for James Wilkinson, in the [[French Quarter]] near [[Jackson Square, New Orleans|Jackson Square]].<ref>{{cite book | author=Elaine Lacoste | title= Street Names & Picayune Histories of New Orleans|publisher=Ho'olauna Hawaii, Ltd.|year=1997}} {{ISBN|0-9656409-0-6}}</ref> There is also a Wilkinson Street in [[Mandeville, Louisiana]]. Many of the oldest streets in Mandeville, close to [[Lake Pontchartrain]], are named after prominent New Orleans residents of the late 18th and early 19th centuries or for [[Battle of New Orleans]] heroes.\n* [[Wilkinson County, Georgia]], is named for Wilkinson. A Georgia historical marker on the courthouse square gives a brief biography of the general and identifies him as the source of the county's name. (The entry on the county in the usually reliable reference ''Georgia Place Names'', by the late Kenneth Krakow, confuses James Wilkinson with James Marion Wilkinson, a [[Valdosta, Georgia]], politician and railroad executive, but the latter Wilkinson was born decades after the county was founded.)\n* [[Wilkinson County, Mississippi]], is named for General Wilkinson as well. It was there in the Old Natchez District that Wilkinson spent much of his time, allegedly plotting the Burr Conspiracy; [[Fort Adams, Mississippi|Fort Adams]] (then an important [[U.S. Army]] post) was constructed by Wilkinson as the most southwesterly point in the U.S. and the last American stop on the [[Mississippi River]] before entering [[New Spain|Spanish]] territory.\n* Wilkinson was an avid supporter of the military's short-hair codes. He attempted to prosecute Colonel [[Thomas Butler (soldier)|Thomas Butler]], a veteran of both the Revolution and the Indian wars, for keeping his long hair. Colonel Butler died before the trials closed. He never did cut his long, braided queue prior to his death and a possibly apocryphal story tells that his last request was for a hole to be drilled in his casket so that the queue could hang out and taunt Wilkinson even in death.<ref>Hickey, Donald R.  \"The United States Army Versus Long Hair: The Trials of Colonel Thomas Butler, 1801\u20131805\", Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography 101 (October 1977): 462\u201374 (in print F146.

After saving it from a pack of [[leopard seals]] on an abandoned ship, and accidentally setting themselves adrift on an iceberg, the egg hatches into their new member, Private, (before the events of the [[Madagascar (2005 film)|first film]]).\n\nTen years later (after the events of the [[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted|previous film]]), the penguins decide to leave the circus to celebrate Private's birthday by breaking into [[United States Bullion Depository|Fort Knox]] in order to treat him to a discontinued snack called \"Cheezy Dibbles\" in the vending machine of their break room. Despite this, Private begins to feel out of place with the team, as he is constantly described as being the \"secretary/mascot\".\n\nSuddenly, they are abducted by the machine and sent to [[Venice]], [[Italy]] by Dr. Octavius Brine, a renowned geneticist who reveals he is actually an octopus named Dave, who has grown resentful of penguins after their cuteness had him shunned from every zoo and aquarium across the globe. Rico swallows Dave's collection of [[snowglobes]] along with a canister of a green substance called the Medusa Serum before the four escape and are chased through the canals and streets of Venice by Dave's henchmen.\n\nWhen cornered, they are rescued by a group of animals from an [[Arctic]] elite undercover inter-species task force agency called \"The North Wind\" consisting of their leader, a [[wolf]] whose name is classified in which Skipper mistakenly calls him \"Classified\" throughout this film, a [[harp seal]] demolitionist named Short Fuse, a [[polar bear]] named Corporal, and an intelligent [[snowy owl]] named Eva, who Kowalski instantly falls in love with. Their mission is to help animals who can't help themselves and have been fighting Dave to protect the penguin population.\n\nAt their hideout, their communication systems are hacked by Dave, who reveals that he has an enormous supply of the Medusa Serum and that he intends to capture the penguins out of every zoo he was kicked out of. Viewing the penguins as a hindrance to their mission, Classified tranquilizes the group and sends them to their most remote base (which happens to be on [[Madagascar]]) but the penguins awaken mid-flight and crash land in the [[Sahara Desert]] before making their way to [[Shanghai, China]], which they mistake for [[Dublin, Ireland]]. Discovering Dave's next target in Shanghai using Dave's snowglobe collection, the penguins ship themselves to the same current location and make their way to the zoo. Skipper disguises Private as a mermaid-tailed penguin (a tourist attraction) to distract Dave from his real target, but Private is captured along with the Shanghai penguins after the North Wind arrives to put a stop to Dave's plan. The penguins take the North Wind's high-tech plane to give chase, but inadvertently self-destruct the machine. They manage to track Private to an island base, using a tracking device planted on him when Classified darted them before planting them in a flight to Madagascar. \n\nMeanwhile, on the island, Dave demonstrates his way to use the medusa serum to genetically mutate the penguins into hideous monsters as an effort to make humans disgusted by them as revenge. Skipper and Classified argue on the best means to rescue the captives and stop Dave, finally settling on Classified's plan of a frontal assault and Skipper agrees to act as a diversion. The North Wind manages to corner Dave in his lair only to be captured by Dave's henchmen as well as the other penguins. Dave demonstrates his mutation ray at full power on Private, apparently disintegrating him with the beam, but unbeknownst to them he escapes at the last minute by using a paper clip he swallowed earlier. Private rescues the North Wind members, who want to [[tactical formation|regroup]] due to lack of equipment, but Private, not wanting to leave anyone behind goes to stop Dave. As Dave's submarine docks at [[New York City|New York]] with the promise of returning the penguins he found to the zoo, he turns the ray on the rest of the penguins, mutating them all into hideous monsters. The city erupts into chaos as the brainwashed, mutated penguins run amok on the terrified human crowd. Getting Skipper, Kowalski and Rico back to their senses, Private decides to connect himself into the ray to return them to normal. After fending off Dave and his henchman, they manage to turn all the penguins back to normal in one huge blast.\n\nPrivate is left THEY ARE CANONICALLY BLACK MEN partially mutated from the machine while the rest of the penguins are restored to normal. Despite his strange new look, the Penguins show their gratitude and new-found respect for Private. Dave (who was caught in the blast) has been turned into a pipsqueak version of himself and is trapped in a snow globe where he is admired by a little girl. Finally seeing one another as equals, Classified promises to grant the Penguins anything they want. In addition to Kowalski getting a kiss from Eva, the Penguins are given their own jet packs and they then fly off above the clouds looking for their new adventures.\n\nIn a [[mid-credits scene]], the Penguins return to the circus and plug Mort into the ray and use him to revert Private back to normal. Mort does not appear to show any side effects from the ray until he manages to swallow King Julien whole, much to the latter's amusement.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{See also|List of Madagascar (franchise) characters}}\n[[File:John Malkovich & Benedict Cumberbatch, Penguins of Madagascar, SDCC 2014.jpg|thumb|[[John Malkovich]] and [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] talking at the ''Penguins of Madagascar'' panel at the 2014 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]]]]\n* [[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]] as Skipper, the leader of the [[penguin]]s.<ref name=USATPeek>{{cite news|last1=Truitt|first1=Brian|title=Sneak Peek: 'Penguins of Madagascar'|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/06/08/penguins-of-madagascar-first-look/9727597/|accessdate=June 9, 2014|work=USA Today|date=June 8, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Chris Miller (animator)|Chris Miller]] as Kowalski, the brains of the penguins.<ref name=USATPeek />\n* [[Christopher Knights]] as Private, the rookie of the penguins.<ref name=USATPeek />\n* [[Conrad Vernon]] as Rico,<ref name=VarietyReview>{{cite news|last1=Berkshire|first1=Geoff|title=Film Review: \u2018Penguins of Madagascar\u2019|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-penguins-of-madagascar-1201353894/|accessdate=November 12, 2014|work=Variety|date=November 12, 2014}}</ref> the loose cannon of the penguins.Vernon replaces [[John DiMaggio]] as the voice of Rico in this film.\n* [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as Classified, a British [[wolf]] and team leader of the North Wind.<ref name=WrapCumberMalko /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/11/benedict-cumberbatch-penguins-of-madagascar |title=Benedict Cumberbatch to voice wolf in new Madagascar movie |first=Ben |last=Beaumont-Thomas |date=June 11, 2014|publisher=The Guardian|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vox.com/2014/11/26/7290373/benedict-cumberbatch-penguins |title=Here are some of Benedict Cumberbatch\u2019s most oddly sexy lines from Penguins of Madagascar |first=Emily Todd |last=VanDerWerff |date=November 26, 2014 |website=Vox}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cartoonbrew.com/feature-film/penguins-of-madagascar-actor-benedict-cumberbatch-thinks-he-worked-on-a-disney-film-105013.html |title=Benedict Cumberbatch Thinks 'Penguins of Madagascar' is A Disney Film |date=October 24, 2014 |website=Cartoon Brew}}</ref>\n* [[Ken Jeong]] as Short Fuse, a Belgian explosive and demolitions expert [[harp seal]] and a member of the North Wind.<ref name=WrapDateSwitch>{{cite web|last=Cunningham|first=Todd|title=DreamWorks Animation Switches Release Dates on \u2018Penguins of Madagascar\u2019 and \u2018Home\u2019|url=https://www.thewrap.com/dreamworks-animation-switches-release-dates-on-penguins-of-madagascar-and-home/|publisher=The Wrap|accessdate=May 21, 2014|date=May 20, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Annet Mahendru]] as Eva, a Russian [[snowy owl]], Kowalski's love interest, and the north wind's intelligence analyst.<ref name=\"USATPeek\" />\n* [[Peter Stormare]] as Corporal, a Norwegian [[polar bear]] and a member of the North Wind who serves as the muscle.<ref name=USATPeek />\n* [[John Malkovich]] as Dave, a villainous and disgruntled [[octopus]] who has the human disguise of Dr. Octavius Brine.<ref name=\"WrapCumberMalko\" /><ref name=\"USATPeek\" /><ref name=\"EWTralierSpies\">{{cite news|last1=McHenry|first1=Jackson|title='The Penguins of Madagascar' trailer: Spies and Benedict Cumberbatch -- VIDEO|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/06/11/penguins-madagascar-benedict-cumberbatch/|accessdate=June 13, 2014|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=June 11, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Werner Herzog]] as a documentary filmmaker.<ref name=SlashFilmRecap>{{cite web|last1=Han|first1=Angie|title=Penguins of Madagascar\u2019 Footage Recap and Panel Highlights [Comic Con 2014]|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/penguins-of-madagascar-footage-comic-con/|publisher=/Film|accessdate=July 25, 2014|date=July 25, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Danny Jacobs (actor)|Danny Jacobs]] as King Julien XIII, a [[ring-tailed lemur]].\n* [[Andy Richter]] as Mort, a [[Goodman's mouse lemur]].\n\n==Production==\nA [[direct-to-video]] film featuring the penguins had been in the works since 2005 when the first ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'' film was released, with a release date initially planned for 2009.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fritz|first=Ben|title=D'Works will rely on animal instinct|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117929100|accessdate=October 27, 2011|newspaper=Variety|date=September 14, 2005}}</ref> The studio announced in March 2011 that the penguin characters would be given their own feature film to be directed by [[Simon J.

After saving it from a pack of [[leopard seals]] on an abandoned ship, and accidentally setting themselves adrift on an iceberg, the egg hatches into their new member, Private, (before the events of the [[Madagascar (2005 film)|first film]]).\n\nTen years later (after the events of the [[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted|previous film]]), the penguins decide to leave the circus to celebrate Private's birthday by breaking into [[United States Bullion Depository|Fort Knox]] in order to treat him to a discontinued snack called \"Cheezy Dibbles\" in the vending machine of their break room. Despite this, Private begins to feel out of place with the team, as he is constantly described as being the \"secretary/mascot\".\n\nSuddenly, they are abducted by the machine and sent to [[Venice]], [[Italy]] by Dr. Octavius Brine, a renowned geneticist who reveals he is actually an octopus named Dave, who has grown resentful of penguins after their cuteness had him shunned from every zoo and aquarium across the globe. Rico swallows Dave's collection of [[snowglobes]] along with a canister of a green substance called the Medusa Serum before the four escape and are chased through the canals and streets of Venice by Dave's henchmen.\n\nWhen cornered, they are rescued by a group of animals from an [[Arctic]] elite undercover inter-species task force agency called \"The North Wind\" consisting of their leader, a [[wolf]] whose name is classified in which Skipper mistakenly calls him \"Classified\" throughout this film, a [[harp seal]] demolitionist named Short Fuse, a [[polar bear]] named Corporal, and an intelligent [[snowy owl]] named Eva, who Kowalski instantly falls in love with. Their mission is to help animals who can't help themselves and have been fighting Dave to protect the penguin population.\n\nAt their hideout, their communication systems are hacked by Dave, who reveals that he has an enormous supply of the Medusa Serum and that he intends to capture the penguins out of every zoo he was kicked out of. Viewing the penguins as a hindrance to their mission, Classified tranquilizes the group and sends them to their most remote base (which happens to be on [[Madagascar]]) but the penguins awaken mid-flight and crash land in the [[Sahara Desert]] before making their way to [[Shanghai, China]], which they mistake for [[Dublin, Ireland]]. Discovering Dave's next target in Shanghai using Dave's snowglobe collection, the penguins ship themselves to the same current location and make their way to the zoo. Skipper disguises Private as a mermaid-tailed penguin (a tourist attraction) to distract Dave from his real target, but Private is captured along with the Shanghai penguins after the North Wind arrives to put a stop to Dave's plan. The penguins take the North Wind's high-tech plane to give chase, but inadvertently self-destruct the machine. They manage to track Private to an island base, using a tracking device planted on him when Classified darted them before planting them in a flight to Madagascar. \n\nMeanwhile, on the island, Dave demonstrates his way to use the medusa serum to genetically mutate the penguins into hideous monsters as an effort to make humans disgusted by them as revenge. Skipper and Classified argue on the best means to rescue the captives and stop Dave, finally settling on Classified's plan of a frontal assault and Skipper agrees to act as a diversion. The North Wind manages to corner Dave in his lair only to be captured by Dave's henchmen as well as the other penguins. Dave demonstrates his mutation ray at full power on Private, apparently disintegrating him with the beam, but unbeknownst to them he escapes at the last minute by using a paper clip he swallowed earlier. Private rescues the North Wind members, who want to [[tactical formation|regroup]] due to lack of equipment, but Private, not wanting to leave anyone behind goes to stop Dave. As Dave's submarine docks at [[New York City|New York]] with the promise of returning the penguins he found to the zoo, he turns the ray on the rest of the penguins, mutating them all into hideous monsters. The city erupts into chaos as the brainwashed, mutated penguins run amok on the terrified human crowd. Getting Skipper, Kowalski and Rico back to their senses, Private decides to connect himself into the ray to return them to normal. After fending off Dave and his henchman, they manage to turn all the penguins back to normal in one huge blast.\n\nPrivate is left partially mutated from the machine while the rest of the penguins are restored to normal. Despite his strange new look, the Penguins show their gratitude and new-found respect for Private. Dave (who was caught in the blast) has been turned into a pipsqueak version of himself and is trapped in a snow globe where he is admired by a little girl. Finally seeing one another as equals, Classified promises to grant the Penguins anything they want. In addition to Kowalski getting a kiss from Eva, the Penguins are given their own jet packs and they then fly off above the clouds looking for their new adventures.\n\nIn a [[mid-credits scene]], the Penguins return to the circus and plug Mort into the ray and use him to revert Private back to normal. Mort does not appear to show any side effects from the ray until he manages to swallow King Julien whole, much to the latter's amusement.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{See also|List of Madagascar (franchise) characters}}\n[[File:John Malkovich & Benedict Cumberbatch, Penguins of Madagascar, SDCC 2014.jpg|thumb|[[John Malkovich]] and [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] talking at the ''Penguins of Madagascar'' panel at the 2014 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]]]]\n* [[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]] as Skipper, the leader of the [[penguin]]s.<ref name=USATPeek>{{cite news|last1=Truitt|first1=Brian|title=Sneak Peek: 'Penguins of Madagascar'|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/06/08/penguins-of-madagascar-first-look/9727597/|accessdate=June 9, 2014|work=USA Today|date=June 8, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Chris Miller (animator)|Chris Miller]] as Kowalski, the brains of the penguins.<ref name=USATPeek />\n* [[Christopher Knights]] as Private, the rookie of the penguins.<ref name=USATPeek />\n* [[Conrad Vernon]] as Rico,<ref name=VarietyReview>{{cite news|last1=Berkshire|first1=Geoff|title=Film Review: \u2018Penguins of Madagascar\u2019|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-penguins-of-madagascar-1201353894/|accessdate=November 12, 2014|work=Variety|date=November 12, 2014}}</ref> the loose cannon of the penguins.Vernon replaces [[John DiMaggio]] as the voice of Rico in this film.\n* [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as Classified, a British [[wolf]] and team leader of the North Wind.<ref name=WrapCumberMalko /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/11/benedict-cumberbatch-penguins-of-madagascar |title=Benedict Cumberbatch to voice wolf in new Madagascar movie |first=Ben |last=Beaumont-Thomas |date=June 11, 2014|publisher=The Guardian|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vox.com/2014/11/26/7290373/benedict-cumberbatch-penguins |title=Here are some of Benedict Cumberbatch\u2019s most oddly sexy lines from Penguins of Madagascar |first=Emily Todd |last=VanDerWerff |date=November 26, 2014 |website=Vox}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cartoonbrew.com/feature-film/penguins-of-madagascar-actor-benedict-cumberbatch-thinks-he-worked-on-a-disney-film-105013.html |title=Benedict Cumberbatch Thinks 'Penguins of Madagascar' is A Disney Film |date=October 24, 2014 |website=Cartoon Brew}}</ref>\n* [[Ken Jeong]] as Short Fuse, a Belgian explosive and demolitions expert [[harp seal]] and a member of the North Wind.<ref name=WrapDateSwitch>{{cite web|last=Cunningham|first=Todd|title=DreamWorks Animation Switches Release Dates on \u2018Penguins of Madagascar\u2019 and \u2018Home\u2019|url=https://www.thewrap.com/dreamworks-animation-switches-release-dates-on-penguins-of-madagascar-and-home/|publisher=The Wrap|accessdate=May 21, 2014|date=May 20, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Annet Mahendru]] as Eva, a Russian [[snowy owl]], Kowalski's love interest, and the north wind's intelligence analyst.<ref name=\"USATPeek\" />\n* [[Peter Stormare]] as Corporal, a Norwegian [[polar bear]] and a member of the North Wind who serves as the muscle.<ref name=USATPeek />\n* [[John Malkovich]] as Dave, a villainous and disgruntled [[octopus]] who has the human disguise of Dr. Octavius Brine.<ref name=\"WrapCumberMalko\" /><ref name=\"USATPeek\" /><ref name=\"EWTralierSpies\">{{cite news|last1=McHenry|first1=Jackson|title='The Penguins of Madagascar' trailer: Spies and Benedict Cumberbatch -- VIDEO|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/06/11/penguins-madagascar-benedict-cumberbatch/|accessdate=June 13, 2014|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=June 11, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Werner Herzog]] as a documentary filmmaker.<ref name=SlashFilmRecap>{{cite web|last1=Han|first1=Angie|title=Penguins of Madagascar\u2019 Footage Recap and Panel Highlights [Comic Con 2014]|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/penguins-of-madagascar-footage-comic-con/|publisher=/Film|accessdate=July 25, 2014|date=July 25, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Danny Jacobs (actor)|Danny Jacobs]] as King Julien XIII, a [[ring-tailed lemur]].\n* [[Andy Richter]] as Mort, a [[Goodman's mouse lemur]].\n\n==Production==\nA [[direct-to-video]] film featuring the penguins had been in the works since 2005 when the first ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'' film was released, with a release date initially planned for 2009.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fritz|first=Ben|title=D'Works will rely on animal instinct|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117929100|accessdate=October 27, 2011|newspaper=Variety|date=September 14, 2005}}</ref> The studio announced in March 2011 that the penguin characters would be given their own feature film to be directed by [[Simon J.
