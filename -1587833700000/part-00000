It connects the [[Buckhead (Atlanta)|Buckhead]] area of [[Atlanta]] with [[Cumming, Georgia|Cumming]]. Its routing exists within portions of [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton]], [[DeKalb County, Georgia|DeKalb]], [[Gwinnett County, Georgia|Gwinnett]], [[Forsyth County, Georgia|Forsyth]] [[County (United States)|counties]].\n\n==Route description==\n[[File:GA State Route 141 in Peachtree Corners.jpg|thumb|State Route 141 in [[Peachtree Corners, Georgia|Peachtree Corners]]]]\nSR&nbsp;141 begins at an [[Intersection (road)|intersection]] with [[U.S. Route 19 in Georgia|US&nbsp;19]]/[[Georgia State Route 9|SR&nbsp;9]] (Roswell Road NE) in the [[Buckhead (Atlanta)|Buckhead neighborhood]] of [[Atlanta]], in [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]]. It travels to the northeast to an intersection with [[Georgia State Route 237|SR&nbsp;237]] (Piedmont Road NE). Just after that intersection, it goes over, but does not have an [[Interchange (road)|interchange]] with [[Georgia State Route 400|SR&nbsp;400]] (T. Harvey Mathis Parkway). Immediately after is the southern terminus of [[Georgia State Route 141 Connector (Atlanta)|SR&nbsp;141 Connector]] (Lenox Road NE). The highway passes just northwest of the Buckhead Heights neighborhood, crosses into [[DeKalb County, Georgia|DeKalb County]], and passes through [[Brookhaven, Georgia|Brookhaven]]. SR&nbsp;141 passes [[Oglethorpe University]] and the Peachtree Golf Club, just before passing through [[Chamblee, Georgia|Chamblee]]. In [[Doraville, Georgia|Doraville]], it has an intersection with [[Georgia State Route 13 Connector (Doraville)|SR&nbsp;13 Connector]] and an interchange with [[Interstate 285 (Georgia)|Interstate 285]] (I-285). The road becomes a freeway on the northeast of the interchange, served by a pair of [[one-way traffic|one-way]] [[frontage road]]s with \"[[Texas U-turn]]s\"; it has a few exits along its length. It enters [[Gwinnett County, Georgia|Gwinnett County]] near the middle of the freeway; near the end of the freeway is [[Georgia State Route 140|SR&nbsp;140]]. It passes through [[Peachtree Corners, Georgia|Peachtree Corners]]. Then, it crosses over the [[Chattahoochee River]] back into Fulton County. It travels through [[Johns Creek, Georgia|Johns Creek]] and meets [[Georgia State Route 120|SR&nbsp;120]] (Abbotts Bridge Road). Northeast of there, it enters [[Forsyth County, Georgia|Forsyth County]]. The roadway curves to the northwest and then to the north. It has an interchange with US&nbsp;19/SR&nbsp;400 (Hospitality Highway), southwest of [[Cumming, Georgia|Cumming]].

The road becomes a freeway on the northeast of the interchange, served by a pair of [[one-way traffic|one-way]] [[frontage road]]s with \"[[Texas U-turn]]s\"; it has a few exits along its length. It enters [[Gwinnett County, Georgia|Gwinnett County]] near the middle of the freeway; near the end of the freeway is [[Georgia State Route 140|SR&nbsp;140]].

Instead, the game takes place in a child's bedroom, placing an emphasis on timing and auditory warnings to complete nights.\n\nUpon release, the game received polarizing reviews from critics; praise centered on its unsettling atmosphere, while others were divided over the game's new mechanics. ''Five Nights at Freddy's 4'' is the only game in the entire series that has no spoken dialogue. The fifth installment, ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location]]'', was released on October 7, 2016.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n<!-- Please do not add speculative content to this section or the plot section from YouTube videos, the FNAF Wiki, or your imagination as they are not considered reliable sources. -->\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Bedroomviewfnaf4.jpg|thumb|left|Instead of the player being in an office they are in a child's bedroom]] -->\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Plushtrap.jpg|thumb|right|The \"Fun with Plushtrap\" minigame.]] -->\nUnlike previous ''Five Nights at Freddy's'' games, the game is not set in a security office, but in a child's bedroom; there are also no [[Closed-circuit television|security cameras]] and instead of \"Phone Guy\", the player is given on-screen instructions to help the player during the game.<ref name=\"KotakuAll\">{{cite web | url=http://kotaku.com/everything-we-know-about-five-nights-at-freddys-4-so-f-1720003919 | title=Everything We Know About Five Nights at Freddy's 4 (So Far) | publisher=Kotaku | date=July 24, 2015 | accessdate=July 25, 2015 | author=Hernandez, Patricia}}</ref> The player is equipped with a flashlight, similar to the [[Five Nights at Freddy's 2|second game]], although the light has unlimited power.<ref name= \"Destruct\">{{cite web | url=http://www.destructoid.com/review-five-nights-at-freddy-s-4-296612.phtml | title=Review: Five Nights at Freddy's 4 | publisher=[[Destructoid]] | date=July 24, 2015 | accessdate=July 25, 2015 | author=Rowen, Nic}}</ref> It can be used to ward away any animatronics seen down the hallway; however, if the player hears either Nightmare Bonnie's or Nightmare Chica's breathing at the door or they see Nightmare Fredbear or Nightmare upon turning on the flashlight, they must immediately close the door. Despite this, the door will eventually open ajar as the player walks away. The player must also monitor the closet to avoid getting attacked by Nightmare Foxy by closing it if necessary, similar to the [[Five Nights at Freddy's|first game]], as well as shooing three miniature animatronics nicknamed 'Freddles' by the FNAF community off the bed before they, once all three are together, summon Nightmare Freddy to attack the player. If the player is not careful in shining the light towards the hallways or leaves the doors, closet and bed unattended for too long, the player will be [[jumpscare]]d, leading to a [[game over]].\n\nAfter beating each night, the player may play a timed minigame titled \"Fun with Plushtrap\" (In Halloween update, Plushtrap is replaced by Nightmare Balloon Boy) in which a plush edition of Springtrap, the central animatronic in ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's 3]]'', must be lured to the top of an \"X\" marked on the ground within a specific amount of time. If the player succeeds, the player will start the next night at 2:00 A.M. (1:00 A.M. in challenge modes) Like the nightmare animatronics, this timed minigame becomes more challenging as the game progresses. The time bonus does not apply to the unlockable modes. Additionally, if the player gets a game over, the bonus is no longer valid for further plays of the same level.\n\nLike previous games, the game's main storyline takes place over five increasingly-difficult nights with unlockable extra levels. The first four nights will put the player against four animatronics: Nightmare Freddy, Nightmare Bonnie, Nightmare Chica and Nightmare Foxy (Nightmare Mangle in Halloween update). Nightmare Fredbear, who combines the scare tactics of the previous four, is the sole attacker on the fifth night. Completing all five nights will unlock an additional sixth night, where the four animatronics will haunt the player until Nightmare Fredbear takes over when the clock hits 4 AM. Completing the sixth night will unlock the \"Nightmare\" night, where the animatronics are very persistent and Nightmare Fredbear is replaced by the highly aggressive Nightmare, who has a unique game over screen compared to other animatronics. A secret code will unlock an eighth night or called as 20/20/20/20 mode based on the Custom Night modes from the first two games, which sets the [[Artificial intelligence|A.I.]] of the animatronics to maximum difficulty. Other unlockables include galleries of the various animatronics and jumpscares, as well as behind-the-scenes looks at the 3D-modelling process for Fredbear and Foxy.<ref name=\"Extras\">{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon| publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene =Extras menu| quote = }}</ref>\n\nAs in most of the previous entries of the series, the story of the game is revealed in interactive [[Retrogaming|Atari-style]] minigame sections between nights. Each of the minigames are set in a time frame corresponding to the five nights, beginning with \"5 days until the party\", up to \"0 days until the party.\"\n\n== Plot ==\nThe game starts with a minigame which shows a child who is locked in his bedroom with plush toys, which he calls his only friends.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Five Nights at Freddy's 4|developer=Scott Cawthon|publisher=|platform=[[Personal computer|PC]]|scene=Night 1 prologue|date=July 23, 2015|quote='''Boy:''' These are my friends.}}</ref> After the player survives the first night, the boy's Fredbear plush tells him that \"he\" (the boy's older brother) is hiding in the house, before the boy is jumpscared by him, who is wearing a Foxy mask.<ref>{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Night 2 prologue| quote = '''Fredbear:''' Now he is hiding again. He won't stop until you find him.}}</ref> After the second night, the boy is abandoned at the pizzeria (implied to be the Fredbear's Family Diner briefly mentioned in the [[Five Nights at Freddy's 2|second]] game), only to be warned by Fredbear's voice that \"he\" is coming and that he must be brave; however, since the boy is afraid of the animatronics and costumed mascots, he ends up bawling. An [[Easter egg (interaction design)|easter egg]] during this scene briefly shows William Afton from the second and [[Five Nights at Freddy's 3|third]] games fitting someone into the Spring Bonnie suit.<ref>{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Night 3 prologue| quote = '''Fredbear:''' You're too late.

I hear they come to life at night. And if you die, they hide your body and never tell anyone.}}</ref> The boy sees his plush toys as his only friends and generally eschews interaction with other people in favor of them. Another easter egg in this minigame establishes the time period, via a commercial or TV show named \"''Fredbear and Friends''\" dated 1983. After the fourth night, it is revealed that he was once locked in the building's parts and services room as a prank.<ref>{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Night 5 prologue| quote = '''You:''' Please let me out.

On THREE! One...two...}}</ref> Suddenly, Fredbear, who was in the middle of singing, forcefully closes his mouth, due to the boy's tears activating the spring locks, and crushes the boy's head while the brother and his friends stare in sheer horror, realizing their mistake.\n \nAfter the sixth night, the boy hears his older brother apologizing to him<ref>{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Night 6 epilogue| quote = '''Voice:''' Can you hear me?

We're still your friends. Do you still believe that? I'm still here. I will put you back together.}}</ref> The characters then fade out one by one, and the faint sound of a [[electrocardiography|heart monitor]] flatlining can be heard, death of the boy and ending the minigames. Following this, the player unlocks Nightmare mode, which is the same as the sixth night with the exception of a new animatronic, Nightmare, a more aggressive version of Nightmare Fredbear.       \n\nThere is a divide in the community about who had the nightmares. Some say it\u2019s the bite victim, as he\u2019s scared of the animatronics and you play as him during the minigames. While, others say it\u2019s the older brother because, after seeing his brother get killed, he got nightmares because of [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]]( Post Traumactic Stress Disorder). \n\nIf the player completes Nightmare mode, an image of a locked metal trunk is displayed; if the player wiggles the padlocks, the game states that \"Perhaps some things are best left forgotten, for now.\"<ref>{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Nightmare epilogue}}</ref> Cawthon remained cryptic about what is inside the trunk, and eventually announced that he would not disclose what was in it. He gave only one clue: \"What's in the box? It's the pieces [of the franchise's story] put together.\"\n\nThroughout the game, if the screen is brightened or the player looks closely enough, the progression of the fate of the child can be seen through objects next to the bed. When the player turns to the bed, looking to the left of the Freddy plush, three objects appear at different points in time: a bottle of pills, an IV drip, and a vase of flowers.\n\nMany people think that the older brother in the minigames is Michael Afton, and that he presumably is the night guard in the first game, as he could have changed his last name.\n\n== Development and release ==\nBeginning April 27, 2015, Cawthon posted images on his website teasing at another game in the series, originally known as ''Five Nights at Freddy's: The Final Chapter''.

It is the fourth installment of the ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's]]'' series. It was originally planned for release on October 31, 2015, the game was pushed forward to August 8, then again to July 23 when it was unexpectedly released on [[Steam (software)|Steam]].<ref name=FNAF4IGN>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/23/five-nights-at-freddys-4-jump-scares-a-surprise-early-release|title=Five Nights at Freddy's 4 Jump-Scares a Surprise Early Release|accessdate= July 23, 2015}}</ref> It was released for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices on July 25, 2015, and for [[iOS]] devices on August 3, 2015.

Instead, the game takes place in a child's bedroom, placing an emphasis on timing and auditory warnings to complete nights.\n\nUpon release, the game received polarizing reviews from critics; praise centered on its unsettling atmosphere, while others were divided over the game's new mechanics. ''Five Nights at Freddy's 4'' is the only game in the entire series that has no spoken dialogue. The fifth installment, ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location]]'', was released on October 7, 2016.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n<!-- Please do not add speculative content to this section or the plot section from YouTube videos, the FNAF Wiki, or your imagination as they are not considered reliable sources. -->\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Bedroomviewfnaf4.jpg|thumb|left|Instead of the player being in an office they are in a child's bedroom]] -->\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Plushtrap.jpg|thumb|right|The \"Fun with Plushtrap\" minigame.]] -->\nUnlike previous ''Five Nights at Freddy's'' games, the game is not set in a security office, but in a child's bedroom; there are also no [[Closed-circuit television|security cameras]] and instead of \"Phone Guy\", the player is given on-screen instructions to help the player during the game.<ref name=\"KotakuAll\">{{cite web | url=http://kotaku.com/everything-we-know-about-five-nights-at-freddys-4-so-f-1720003919 | title=Everything We Know About Five Nights at Freddy's 4 (So Far) | publisher=Kotaku | date=July 24, 2015 | accessdate=July 25, 2015 | author=Hernandez, Patricia}}</ref> The player is equipped with a flashlight, similar to the [[Five Nights at Freddy's 2|second game]], although the light has unlimited power.<ref name= \"Destruct\">{{cite web | url=http://www.destructoid.com/review-five-nights-at-freddy-s-4-296612.phtml | title=Review: Five Nights at Freddy's 4 | publisher=[[Destructoid]] | date=July 24, 2015 | accessdate=July 25, 2015 | author=Rowen, Nic}}</ref> It can be used to ward away any animatronics seen down the hallway; however, if the player hears either Nightmare Bonnie's or Nightmare Chica's breathing at the door or they see Nightmare Fredbear or Nightmare upon turning on the flashlight, they must immediately close the door. Despite this, the door will eventually open ajar as the player walks away. The player must also monitor the closet to avoid getting attacked by Nightmare Foxy by closing it if necessary, similar to the [[Five Nights at Freddy's|first game]], as well as shooing three miniature animatronics nicknamed 'Freddles' by the FNAF community off the bed before they, once all three are together, summon Nightmare Freddy to attack the player. If the player is not careful in shining the light towards the hallways or leaves the doors, closet and bed unattended for too long, the player will be [[jumpscare]]d, leading to a [[game over]].\n\nAfter beating each night, the player may play a timed minigame titled \"Fun with Plushtrap\" (In Halloween update, Plushtrap is replaced by Nightmare Balloon Boy) in which a plush edition of Springtrap, the central animatronic in ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's 3]]'', must be lured to the top of an \"X\" marked on the ground within a specific amount of time. If the player succeeds, the player will start the next night at 2:00 A.M. (1:00 A.M. in challenge modes) Like the nightmare animatronics, this timed minigame becomes more challenging as the game progresses. The time bonus does not apply to the unlockable modes. Additionally, if the player gets a game over, the bonus is no longer valid for further plays of the same level.\n\nLike previous games, the game's main storyline takes place over five increasingly-difficult nights with unlockable extra levels. The first four nights will put the player against four animatronics: Nightmare Freddy, Nightmare Bonnie, Nightmare Chica and Nightmare Foxy (Nightmare Mangle in Halloween update). Nightmare Fredbear, who combines the scare tactics of the previous four, is the sole attacker on the fifth night. Completing all five nights will unlock an additional sixth night, where the four animatronics will haunt the player until Nightmare Fredbear takes over when the clock hits 4 AM. Completing the sixth night will unlock the \"Nightmare\" night, where the animatronics are very persistent and Nightmare Fredbear is replaced by the highly aggressive Nightmare, who has a unique game over screen compared to other animatronics. A secret code will unlock an eighth night or called as 20/20/20/20 mode based on the Custom Night modes from the first two games, which sets the [[Artificial intelligence|A.I.]] of the animatronics to maximum difficulty. Other unlockables include galleries of the various animatronics and jumpscares, as well as behind-the-scenes looks at the 3D-modelling process for Fredbear and Foxy.<ref name=\"Extras\">{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon| publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene =Extras menu| quote = }}</ref>\n\nAs in most of the previous entries of the series, the story of the game is revealed in interactive [[Retrogaming|Atari-style]] minigame sections between nights. Each of the minigames are set in a time frame corresponding to the five nights, beginning with \"5 days until the party\", up to \"0 days until the party.\"\n\n== Plot ==\nThe game starts with a minigame which shows a child who is locked in his bedroom with plush toys, which he calls his only friends.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Five Nights at Freddy's 4|developer=Scott Cawthon|publisher=|platform=[[Personal computer|PC]]|scene=Night 1 prologue|date=July 23, 2015|quote='''Boy:''' These are my friends.}}</ref> After the player survives the first night, the boy's Fredbear plush tells him that \"he\" (the boy's older brother) is hiding in the house, before the boy is jumpscared by him, who is wearing a Foxy mask.<ref>{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Night 2 prologue| quote = '''Fredbear:''' Now he is hiding again. He won't stop until you find him.}}</ref> After the second night, the boy is abandoned at the pizzeria (implied to be the Fredbear's Family Diner briefly mentioned in the [[Five Nights at Freddy's 2|second]] game), only to be warned by Fredbear's voice that \"he\" is coming and that he must be brave; however, since the boy is afraid of the animatronics and costumed mascots, he ends up bawling. An [[Easter egg (interaction design)|easter egg]] during this scene briefly shows William Afton from the second and [[Five Nights at Freddy's 3|third]] games fitting someone into the Spring Bonnie suit.<ref>{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Night 3 prologue| quote = '''Fredbear:''' You're too late. Hurry the other way and find someone who will help! You know what will happen if he catches you! You can find help if you can get past them.

I hear they come to life at night. And if you die, they hide your body and never tell anyone.}}</ref> The boy sees his plush toys as his only friends and generally eschews interaction with other people in favor of them. Another easter egg in this minigame establishes the time period, via a commercial or TV show named \"''Fredbear and Friends''\" dated 1983. After the fourth night, it is revealed that he was once locked in the building's parts and services room as a prank.<ref>{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Night 5 prologue| quote = '''You:''' Please let me out.

On THREE! One...two...}}</ref> Suddenly, Fredbear, who was in the middle of singing, forcefully closes his mouth, due to the boy's tears activating the spring locks, and crushes the boy's head while the brother and his friends stare in sheer horror, realizing their mistake.\n \nAfter the sixth night, the boy hears his older brother apologizing to him<ref>{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Night 6 epilogue| quote = '''Voice:''' Can you hear me? I don't know if you can hear me.

We're still your friends. Do you still believe that? I'm still here. I will put you back together.}}</ref> The characters then fade out one by one, and the faint sound of a [[electrocardiography|heart monitor]] flatlining can be heard, death of the boy and ending the minigames. Following this, the player unlocks Nightmare mode, which is the same as the sixth night with the exception of a new animatronic, Nightmare, a more aggressive version of Nightmare Fredbear.       \n\nThere is a a divide in the community about who had the nightmares. Some say it\u2019s the bite victim, as he\u2019s scared of the animatronics and you play as him during the minigames. While, others say it\u2019s the older brother because, after seeing his brother get killed, he got nightmares because of [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]]( Post Traumactic Stress Disorder). \n\nIf the player completes Nightmare mode, an image of a locked metal trunk is displayed; if the player wiggles the padlocks, the game states that \"Perhaps some things are best left forgotten, for now.\"<ref>{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Nightmare epilogue}}</ref> Cawthon remained cryptic about what is inside the trunk, and eventually announced that he would not disclose what was in it. He gave only one clue: \"What's in the box? It's the pieces [of the franchise's story] put together.\"\n\nThroughout the game, if the screen is brightened or the player looks closely enough, the progression of the fate of the child can be seen through objects next to the bed. When the player turns to the bed, looking to the left of the Freddy plush, three objects appear at different points in time: a bottle of pills, an IV drip, and a vase of flowers.\n\nMany people think that the older brother in the minigames is Michael Afton, and that he presumably is the night guard in the first game, as he could have changed his last name.\n\n== Development and release ==\nBeginning April 27, 2015, Cawthon posted images on his website teasing at another game in the series, originally known as ''Five Nights at Freddy's: The Final Chapter''. The images, featuring the characters from the series, cryptically teased at a release on Halloween.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.vg247.com/2015/04/28/five-nights-at-freddys-4-release-date/ | title = Five Night\u2019s at Freddy\u2019s 4 teased for Halloween release | first =Brenna | last = Hillier | date = April 28, 2015 | accessdate = May 16, 2015 | work = [[VG247]]|publisher = Videogaming 247 Ltd. }}</ref> A trailer was released on July 13, 2015, hinting that the game took place in the main character's house.

H1387]]\n\nThroughout the 20th century, the Hayes village area continued to grow and thrive. Further commercial development occurred on Station Approach because the increased traffic through the railway terminus created an incentive for growth. In the old village area ('Old Hayes'), the former village school was converted to a second, smaller village hall when the local primary school opened in 1937;<ref name=\"hps\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hayes-pri.bromley.sch.uk/346/our-school-history|title=Our School History - Hayes Primary School|website=www.hayes-pri.bromley.sch.uk|language=en|access-date=4 July 2017}}</ref> it lies along George Lane, which was further expanded at around the same time to facilitate further suburban housing developments.\n\n==Modern suburban Hayes==\n\nTo cope with the increase in commuter traffic, the station was rebuilt in 1935, and ''Station Approach'' became the main shopping area,<ref name=\"gazetteer\">{{Cite web|url=http://hidden-london.com/gazetteer/hayes-bromley/|title=Hayes, Bromley - Hidden London|website=hidden-london.com|language=en-US|access-date=4 July 2017}}</ref> including a [[Post Office]], [[petrol station]], two mini-supermarkets and numerous small shops. It also contains a [[public house]] called The New Inn.\n\nMuch of the area to the west and north-west of the original village has been taken over by [[suburbia]]. [[West Wickham]] and Bromley are completely joined with Hayes; and [[Coney Hall]] estate, beyond the [[Orpington]] - [[Croydon]] road is also part of the pattern. To the east and south, however, the open space of [[Hayes Common]] precludes building of any kind.\n\nGrandfields Nursery in West Common Road was hit by a [[V-2 rocket]] in the late afternoon of 9 February 1945, killing four people, including three members of the Grandfield family. Our Lady of the Rosary Catholic Church was later built on the site.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://catholic-hayes.org/past-present/|title=Past & Present|date=14 February 2018|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe old village area along Hayes Street, also known as 'Old Hayes', today contains some small shops, though the local post office closed in 2004 (the nearest is now in the main shopping area near the station). The timbered cottage on the eastern side of Hayes Street was originally the village bakery, then it became a [[newsagent]]s called \"The Walnut Tree\", until 2006, when it changed to residential use. The former village school remains a second village hall; the local primary school in George Lane has expanded in size in recent years, and now has three class groups in each year. It is extremely popular, and many of its pupils go on to [[Hayes School]] in West Common Road.\n\nThe shopping area in ''Old Hayes'' functions as a second hub for commercial businesses, running along Hayes street opposite the church building. It consists of the public house, \"The George\", a mini-market, several hairdressers, a cycle shop, two coffee shops and a fish and chip shop. Next to the church is the village [[Public Library|public]] [[Bromley Borough Libraries Service|library]], occupying the old [[rectory]] building (since replaced by the new rectory), and is surrounded by the library gardens, a small area of parkland containing tennis courts.\n\nHayes Street Farm continues to play an important role in the village setting. Several public pathways and popular walking routes run through the farmland, and regular [[car boot sale]]s are hosted on the farm fields.\n\nThere is a group called Hayes Village Association (HVA) which meet regularly to inform people about local issues. They regularly liaise with Bromley Council on planning matters and they give a voice to residents and businesses on a variety of issues.

H1387]]\n\nThroughout the 20th century, the Hayes village area continued to grow and thrive. Further commercial development occurred on Station Approach because the increased traffic through the railway terminus created an incentive for growth. In the old village area ('Old Hayes'), the former village school was converted to a second, smaller village hall when the local primary school opened in 1937;<ref name=\"hps\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hayes-pri.bromley.sch.uk/346/our-school-history|title=Our School History - Hayes Primary School|website=www.hayes-pri.bromley.sch.uk|language=en|access-date=4 July 2017}}</ref> it lies along George Lane, which was further expanded at around the same time to facilitate further suburban housing developments.\n\n==Modern suburban Hayes==\n\nTo cope with the increase in commuter traffic, the station was rebuilt in 1935, and ''Station Approach'' became the main shopping area,<ref name=\"gazetteer\">{{Cite web|url=http://hidden-london.com/gazetteer/hayes-bromley/|title=Hayes, Bromley - Hidden London|website=hidden-london.com|language=en-US|access-date=4 July 2017}}</ref> including a [[Post Office]], [[petrol station]], two mini-supermarkets and numerous small shops. It also contains a [[public house]] called The New Inn.\n\nMuch of the area to the west and north-west of the original village has been taken over by [[suburbia]]. [[West Wickham]] and Bromley are completely joined with Hayes; and [[Coney Hall]] estate, beyond the [[Orpington]] - [[Croydon]] road is also part of the pattern. To the east and south, however, the open space of [[Hayes Common]] precludes building of any kind.\n\nGrandfields Nursery in West Common Road was hit by a [[V-2 rocket]] in the late afternoon of 9 February 1945, killing four people, including three members of the Grandfield family. Our Lady of the Rosary Catholic Church was later built on the site.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://catholic-hayes.org/past-present/|title=Past & Present|date=14 February 2018|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe old village area along Hayes Street, also known as 'Old Hayes', today contains some small shops, though the local post office closed in 2004 (the nearest is now in the main shopping area near the station). The timbered cottage on the eastern side of Hayes Street was originally the village bakery, then it became a [[newsagent]]s called \"The Walnut Tree\", until 2006, when it changed to residential use. The former village school remains a second village hall; the local primary school in George Lane has expanded in size in recent years, and now has three class groups in each year. It is extremely popular, and many of its pupils go on to [[Hayes School]] in West Common Road.\n\nThe shopping area in ''Old Hayes'' functions as a second hub for commercial businesses, running along Hayes street opposite the church building. It consists of the public house, \"The George\", a mini-market, several hairdressers, a cycle shop, two coffee shops and a fish and chip shop. Next to the church is the village [[Public Library|public]] [[Bromley Borough Libraries Service|library]], occupying the old [[rectory]] building (since replaced by the new rectory), and is surrounded by the library gardens, a small area of parkland containing tennis courts.\n\nHayes Street Farm continues to play an important role in the village setting. Several public pathways and popular walking routes run through the farmland, and regular [[car boot sale]]s are hosted on the farm fields.\n\nThere is a group called Hayes Village Association (HVA) which meet regularly to inform people about local issues. They regularly liaise with Bromley Council on planning matters and they give a voice to residents and businesses on a variety of issues. HVA produce a quarterly magazine with local interest articles and events, as well as details of businesses in the locality.\n\n==Sports and leisure==\n\nThere are numerous playing fields and sports grounds around the periphery of Hayes: such as the Metropolitan Police Sports Ground at the Warren. It is also home, since 1927, to the world-famous Blackheath Harriers Athletics Club (now [[Blackheath and Bromley Harriers Athletic Club]]) at their clubhouse ''The [[Sydney Wooderson]] Centre''.\n\n* Hayes Town FC (Formed 2016).

He had first caught the eye of Barons' manager [[Piper Davis]] in tenth grade, when Davis had Mays try out for the team. Davis encouraged Mays to work on hitting the [[curveball]], coached him periodically for a couple years, and gave Mays a chance to play for the Barons starting in 1947, when Mays was just 16.<ref>Mays, pp. 24, 26, 30</ref> When E.

Mays hit a respectable .262 for the season, but it was also his excellent fielding and baserunning that made him a standout.<ref>Hirsch, p. 38-48</ref>\n\nOver the next several years, a number of major league baseball franchises sent scouts to watch him play. The first was the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]]. The scout who discovered him, Bud Maughn, had been following him for over a year and referred him to the Braves, who then packaged a deal that called for $7,500 down and $7,500 in 30 days. They also planned to give Mays $6,000. The obstacle in the deal was that Tom Hayes, owner of the [[Birmingham Black Barons]], wanted to keep Mays for the balance of the season. Had the team been able to act more quickly, the Braves franchise might have had both Mays and [[Hank Aaron]] in their outfield from 1954 to 1973. The [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] also scouted him and wanted Ray Blades to negotiate a deal, but they were too late. The New York Giants had already signed Mays for $4,000 and assigned him to their Class-B affiliate in [[Trenton, New Jersey]].<ref>June 22, 1950 letter from Eddie Montague to Jack Schwarz</ref>\n\n===Minor leagues===\nAccording to Mays, Eddie Montague had been sent to Birmingham to scout [[Alonzo Perry]] as a potential first baseman for the [[Sioux City Soos]] of the Class-A [[Western League (1900\u20131958)|Western League]], but Montague became interested in Mays instead after watching a doubleheader.<ref>Mays, pp. 44-45</ref> Due to a scandal in Sioux City concerning a Native American's burial in a whites-only cemetery at the time, Sioux City decided not to take Mays, and he was assigned to the [[Trenton Giants]] of the [[Interstate League]] instead.<ref>Mays, pp. 45-46</ref>\n\nAfter Mays batted .353 in Trenton, he began the 1951 season with the class AAA [[Minneapolis Millers]] of the [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]]. During his short time span in Minneapolis, Mays played with two other future Hall of Famers: [[Hoyt Wilhelm]] and [[Ray Dandridge]]. Batting .477 in 35 games and playing excellent defense, Mays was called up to the Giants on May 24, 1951. Mays was at a [[movie theater]] in [[Sioux City, Iowa]] when he found out he was being called up. A message flashed up on the screen that said:  \"WILLIE MAYS CALL YOUR HOTEL.\"<ref>''The Giants of the Polo Grounds'' by Noel Hynd (1988).

Although his .274 average, 68 RBI and 20 homers (in 121 games) were among the lowest of his career, he still won the 1951 [[MLB Rookie of the Year award|Rookie of the Year Award]].

In the middle of May, 1955, Durocher asked him to try for more home runs.<ref>Mays, pp. 128-29</ref> Mays led the league with 51.

In 1957, the first season the [[Gold Glove]] award was presented, he won the first of 12 consecutive [[Gold Glove Award]]s. At the same time, Mays continued to finish in the National League's top-five in a variety of offensive categories. Mays, [[Roberto Clemente]] (also with 12), [[Al Kaline]], [[Andruw Jones]], [[Ken Griffey, Jr.]] and [[Ichiro Suzuki]] are the only outfielders to have ten or more career Gold Gloves. In 1957, Mays became the fourth player in major league history to join the [[20\u201320\u201320 club]] (2B, 3B, HR), something no player had accomplished since 1941.

He had first caught the eye of Barons' manager [[Piper Davis]] in tenth grade, when Davis had Mays try out for the team. Davis encouraged Mays to work on hitting the [[curveball]], coached him periodically for a couple years, and gave Mays a chance to play for the Barons starting in 1947, when Mays was just 16.<ref>Mays, pp. 24, 26, 30</ref> When E. T. Oliver, principal at Mays's high school, threatened to suspend Mays for playing professional ball, Davis and Mays's father convinced him that Mays would still be able to concentrate on his studies.<ref>Mays, p. 32</ref> Mays helped Birmingham win the pennant and advance to the 1948 [[Negro League World Series]], which they lost 4-1 to the [[Homestead Grays]]. Mays hit a respectable .262 for the season, but it was also his excellent fielding and baserunning that made him a standout.<ref>Hirsch, p. 38-48</ref>\n\nOver the next several years, a number of major league baseball franchises sent scouts to watch him play. The first was the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]]. The scout who discovered him, Bud Maughn, had been following him for over a year and referred him to the Braves, who then packaged a deal that called for $7,500 down and $7,500 in 30 days. They also planned to give Mays $6,000. The obstacle in the deal was that Tom Hayes, owner of the [[Birmingham Black Barons]], wanted to keep Mays for the balance of the season. Had the team been able to act more quickly, the Braves franchise might have had both Mays and [[Hank Aaron]] in their outfield from 1954 to 1973. The [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] also scouted him and wanted Ray Blades to negotiate a deal, but they were too late. The New York Giants had already signed Mays for $4,000 and assigned him to their Class-B affiliate in [[Trenton, New Jersey]].<ref>June 22, 1950 letter from Eddie Montague to Jack Schwarz</ref>\n\n===Minor leagues===\nAccording to Mays, Eddie Montague had been sent to Birmingham to scout [[Alonzo Perry]] as a potential first baseman for the [[Sioux City Soos]] of the Class-A [[Western League (1900\u20131958)|Western League]], but Montague became interested in Mays instead after watching a doubleheader.<ref>Mays, pp. 44-45</ref> Due to a scandal in Sioux City concerning a Native American's burial in a whites-only cemetery at the time, Sioux City decided not to take Mays, and he was assigned to the [[Trenton Giants]] of the [[Interstate League]] instead.<ref>Mays, pp. 45-46</ref>\n\nAfter Mays batted .353 in Trenton, he began the 1951 season with the class AAA [[Minneapolis Millers]] of the [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]]. During his short time span in Minneapolis, Mays played with two other future Hall of Famers: [[Hoyt Wilhelm]] and [[Ray Dandridge]]. Batting .477 in 35 games and playing excellent defense, Mays was called up to the Giants on May 24, 1951. Mays was at a [[movie theater]] in [[Sioux City, Iowa]] when he found out he was being called up. A message flashed up on the screen that said:  \"WILLIE MAYS CALL YOUR HOTEL.\"<ref>''The Giants of the Polo Grounds'' by Noel Hynd (1988). New York: Doubleday. page 358. {{ISBN|0-385 23790-1}}</ref>{{efn|Mays's autobiography has the account slightly differently. He remembered the houselights coming on in the middle of a movie and someone mounting the stage to announce, \"If Willie Mays is in the audience, would he please report immediately to his manager at the hotel.\"<ref>Mays, p. 60</ref>}} He appeared in his first major league game the next day in [[Philadelphia]]. Mays moved to [[Harlem, New York]], where his mentor was a [[New York State Boxing Commission]] official and former Harlem Rens basketball legend  \"Strangler\" [[Frank Forbes]].\n\n===Major leagues===\n\n====New York Giants (1951\u20131957)====\nMays began his major league career on a sour note, with no hits in his first 12 [[at bat]]s. On his 13th at-bat, however, he hit a towering home run up and over the left field roof of the [[Polo Grounds]] off future [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Famer]] [[Warren Spahn]].<ref>[http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00016223.html ESPN.com: Mays brought joy to baseball<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Spahn later joked, \"I'll never forgive myself.

Schehr was nevertheless arrested on 13 November 1933 and taken to [[Columbia concentration camp|a Berlin concentration camp]]. He died when he was one of four men shot by [[Gestapo]] officials, reportedly \"while escaping\" during an overnight transport, following arrest.<ref name=JSlauHDK>{{cite web |title= Schehr, John  * 9.2.1896  \u2020 1.2.1934|work=Handbuch der Deutschen Kommunisten| author1=[[Hermann Weber]]|author2=[[Andreas Herbst]] |url= https://www.bundesstiftung-aufarbeitung.de/de/recherche/kataloge-datenbanken/biographische-datenbanken/john-schehr?ID=5063 |publisher=Karl Dietz Verlag, Berlin & Bundesstiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED-Diktatur, Berlin| accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=JSlautGDW>{{cite web|url=https://www.gdw-berlin.de/en/recess/biographies/index_of_persons/biographie/view-bio/john-schehr/?no_cache=1|title=John Schehr:  February 09, 1896 - February 01, 1934 |publisher= Gedenkst\u00e4tte Deutscher Widerstand (German Resistance Memorial Center), Berlin| accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref><ref name= JSlautFreundeskreisET>{{cite web|url=http://www.etg-ziegenhals.de/John_Schehr.html|title=John Schehr (1896 \u2013 1934) |publisher= Freundeskreis \u201eErnst Th\u00e4lmann\u201c e.V., Ziegenhals-Berlin|accessdate=23 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Aftermath of World War II|National Socialist nightmare ended]] Schehr and his three murdered comrades became celebrated, for the benefit of a new generation, in the [[German Democratic Republic|German Democratic Republic (East Germany: 1949-1989)]] by means of a poem written, probably, shortly after the killing, by [[Erich Weinert]].<ref name=JohnSchehruGenossen>{{cite web |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130304112709/http://www.mdr.de/mdr-figaro/hoerspiel/feature/johnschehr100.html|date=2 March 2013| title=John Schehr und Genossen|work=Ein Mord, ein Mythos und die Folgen|publisher=[[MDR Fernsehen |MDR]] (\"Figaro\"), [[Leipzig]]|accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Life ==\n=== Provenance and early years ===\nJohn \"Jonny\" Schehr was born into a working-class family in the [[Ottensen]] quarter of [[Altona|Altona, Hamburg]], at that time a robustly independent municipality, but [[Greater Hamburg Act|subsequently - in 1937 -  subsumed]] into [[Hamburg]].<ref name=JSlauHDK/>   His father worked as a [[hairdresser]].<ref name=JSlautFS/>   As a boy he was particularly close to his mother, born Martha Fischer.<ref name=JSlautFS/>   John Schehr's younger brother, Franz, later recalled that the family always read [[:de:Hamburger Echo|the Hamburger Echo]] and [[:de:Der wahre Jacob|Wahre Jacob]], both staunchly [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] newspapers.<ref name=JSlautFS>:{{cite web|page=4|work=Franz Schehr: Erinnerung an den Bruder|url= https://www.thaelmann-gedenkstaette.de/GSETHP/Rundbriefe/RB40.pdf|publisher=Kuratorium Gedenkst\u00e4tte Ernst Th\u00e4lmann e.V.:  article reproduced in \"Rundbrief aus dem Th\u00e4lmann-Haus\" from \"John Schehr 1896-1934.

Without intending it, he found himself promoted to the rank of a [[Unteroffizier|\"sub-officer\" (''\"Unteroffizier\"'')]].   It is recorded that during one retreat he skilfully led his troops so that they avoided capture.   His brother Walter Schehr was killed in action in 1916.<ref name=JSlautFS/>   The 1914 decision of the party leadership to [[Burgfriedenspolitik|vote in favour]] of [[War bond|war funding]] and forego criticism of the government for the duration of hostilities during the [[First World War|war]] had been contentious among party activists from the outset, and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] finally split over the issue of support for the war in 1917.   John Schehr, like his mentor [[Ernst Th\u00e4lmann]], was one of a large number of mainly left-wing party members who moved across to the breakaway [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany|Independent Social Democratic Party (''\" Unabh\u00e4ngige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\"'' / USPD)]].<ref name=JSlauHDK/><ref name=JSlautFS/>   After the war there was no immediate return to his skilled work, but [[Port of Hamburg|the docks]] continued to function and he joined his brother Franz in work as a [[stevedore]] till 1924.<ref name=JSlautFS/>   In 1919 when, in its turn, the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany|USPD)]], [[Ernst Th\u00e4lmann |Th\u00e4lmann]] and Schehr, were among the early recruits to the newly launched [[Communist Party of Germany |Communist Party]] in the wake of the so-called [[German Revolution of 1918\u20131919 |November revolutions]].<ref name=JSlautGDW/>    Almost all the USPD activists in the Hamburg district made the same move, which can be seen in large measure as a tribute to Ernst Th\u00e4lmann's oratorical and political powers of persuasion.   Schehr quickly became an energetic party activist:  his brother recalled later that during the early 1920s he was out almost every evening, undertaking party work.<ref name=JSlautFS/>   \n\n=== From party activist to party officer ===\n1923 was a year of [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|intensified destitution]] across [[Weimar Germany|Germany]], and a number of [[Cuno strikes|major disturbances]].  In Hamburg Schehr took part in the storming the [[Ottensen]] police station, which was one of police stations in and around Hamburg attacked on 23 October in the context of that year's  [[Hamburg Uprising|October uprising]], carefully planned and choreographed by Ernst Th\u00e4lmann on behalf of [[Communist Party of Germany |the party]].<ref name=JSlautFS/>   In 1924 Schehr became a party \"Polleiter\" (''loosely, \"policy head\"'') for [[Altona, Hamburg| Altona]] where he was already, by this time, a municipal councillor.<ref name=JSlauHDK/>   He also regained his skilled work [[Port of Hamburg|on the docks]].   The next year he accepted a fulltime job working within [[Communist Party of Germany |the party]] apparatus, however.<ref name=JSlauHDK/>   It is clear that John Schehr's advancement in the national party over the next few years owed much to the friendship and political patronage of [[Ernst Th\u00e4lmann]], but he evidently had many friends and admirers among local party activists.   A particular friend and political ally was [[:de:Etkar Andr\u00e9 |Etkar Andr\u00e9]].<ref name=JSlautFS/> \n\n=== Party advancement ===\nIt was nevertheless more likely to have been as a result, primarily, of [[Ernst Th\u00e4lmann|Th\u00e4lmann's]] backing that in 1925, at the tenth party congress, John Schehr was elected to membership of the party appeal's commission (''\"Beschwerdekommissio\"'').   The same congress also voted Schehr onto the list of candidates for [[:de:Liste der Mitglieder der Zentralkomitees der KPD|the Party Central Committee]].<ref name=JSlauHDK/>   The dire economic situation during the early 1920s made this a period of expansion for the [[Communist Party of Germany |communists]] in the industrial regions, and during 1925 John Schehr was appointed to lead the party organisation in the recently established [[Harburg-Wilhelmsburg]] sub-district (''\"Unterbezirksleiter\"'') in succession to [[:de:Johann Skjellerup |Johann Skjellerup]].<ref name=JSlauHDK/><ref name=UBLinHWlautCG/>   The appointment was of short duration, however, since in March 1926 the fulltime paid position was abolished, possibly to save money and possibly in response to a decline in party membership locally.<ref name=UBLinHWlautCG>{{cite web|url=http://www.harbuch.de/frische-themen-artikel/radli3.html|title=Die radikale Linke in Harburg-Wilhelmsburg|work=Nachtrag 2: Organisatorische St\u00e4rken und Schw\u00e4chen, interne Fraktionsk\u00e4mpfe 1924-1931|publisher=Dr. Christian Gotthardt, Hamburg|author=Christian Gotthardt|date=April 2018|accessdate=23 April 2020}}</ref>   In 1927 he was appointed \"Orgleiter\" (''loosely \"Head of Administration\"'') for the party's important Hamburg-Wasserkante district (to the west and north of Hamburg),<ref name=JSlautGDW/><ref name=\"EvansGeary2015\">{{cite book|author1=Anthony McElligott (author) |author2=Dick Geary (compiler-editor)|title=Mobilising the unemployed:  the KPD and the Unemployed Workers' Movement in Hamburg-Altona during the Weimar Republic|work=The German Unemployed (Routledge Revivals): Experiences and Consequences of Mass Unemployment from the Weimar Republic to the Third Reich|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SUfLCQAAQBAJ&pg=PT289 |date=5 June 2015|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-317-54203-2|pages=288\u2013294}}</ref> thereby becoming a key member of the regional party executive under the leadership of regional party secretary [[:de:John Wittorf |John Wittorf]].<ref name=JSlauHDK/>\n\n=== Wittorf affair ===\nAlso in 1927 Schehr was again a delegate at the party's eleventh party congress, held that year in [[Essen]].

[[Ernst Th\u00e4lmann]] was, by some criteria, more heavily and directly implicated, and he was indeed briefly ousted from the [[Central Committee|party Central Committee]], but [[Joseph Stalin]], whose influence over the [[Communist Party of Germany|German party leadership]] was immense, intervened to have Th\u00e4lmann reinstated.

Meanwhile a return to widespread economic austerity, as [[Weimar Germany|Germany]] worked through the savage backwash from the [[Great depression]], was creating a surge across Germany in support for the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]].   This was accompanied by increasing political polarisation leading, after [[July 1932 German federal election|1932]], to deadlock in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag (''national parliament'')]] whereby coalition with on or other of the two populist parties, the [[Nazi Party|National Socialists]] and the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communists]] was mathematically necessary for the more moderate parties to coalesce to form a majority coalition, but both extremist parties were unacceptable coaliation parties either for the moderate parties or form each other.   It was in the resulting context of intensifying crisis that in April 1932 John Schehr was elected to [[:de:Liste der Mitglieder des Landtages (Freistaat Preu\u00dfen) (4. Wahlperiode)|membership]] of the [[Landtag of Prussia|Prussian Landtag (''regional parliament'')]] in [[Berlin]].<ref name=JSlauHDK/>   Three months later, in [[July 1932 German federal election|July 1932]], he was elected to the  [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]].<ref name=JSlautDieLinke/>   (His [[Landtag of Prussia|Landtag]] seat was taken over by his party comrade [[:de:August T\u00fcnnermann|August T\u00fcnnermann]].<ref name=ATlauHDK>{{cite web|title=T\u00fcnnermann, August   * 18.8.1896   \u2020 23.12.1982 |work=Handbuch der Deutschen Kommunisten| author1= [[Hermann Weber]]|author2=[[Andreas Herbst]] |url= https://www.bundesstiftung-aufarbeitung.de/de/recherche/kataloge-datenbanken/biographische-datenbanken/ernst-thaelmann |publisher=Karl Dietz Verlag, Berlin & Bundesstiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED-Diktatur, Berlin| accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref>)\n\nWithin the party Schehr's career continued to advance.   During the middle of 1932 he finally became a member of the [[Communist Party of Germany|party]] [[Central Committee]].   This came about not through any vote of delegates at a party congress, but as a result of being co-opted into membership by the existing members.   He relocated to [[Berlin]], becoming both secretary to the Central Committee and a member of its inner caucus, the Politburo.   Schehr was now, in all but name, deputy to the party leader, [[Ernst Th\u00e4lmann]].   His position in the party aparatus was further strengthened after [[Heinz Neumann]] was stripped of his party funcations and then officially condemned by the leadership in November 1932 and sent as a comintern emissary to [[Spain]].   (Neumann had clashed with Th\u00e4lmann whom he believed, along with [[Joseph Stalin]], was dangerously underestimating the strength of the threat presented by [[Adolf Hitler]].<ref name=HNlauHDK>{{cite web| title=Neumann, Heinz  * 6.7.1902   \u2020 26.11.1937  |work=Handbuch der Deutschen Kommunisten| author1= [[Hermann Weber]]|author2= [[Andreas Herbst]] |url= https://www.bundesstiftung-aufarbeitung.de/de/recherche/kataloge-datenbanken/biographische-datenbanken/heinz-neumann |publisher= Karl Dietz Verlag, Berlin & Bundesstiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED-Diktatur, Berlin| accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref>)\n\nIt was probably in October or November 1932 that the police arrested John Schehr  and discovered \"important material\" concerning the [[Communist Party of Germany|party's]] illegal structures (which included a semi-secret quasi-military operation across the nation and a large \"political\" espionage network on a scale normally associated with foreign governments rather than with domestic political parties).<ref name=JSlauHDK/>   The arrest was apparently made \"because of an instruction from the Ministry of Defence\".<ref name=spiegel12993>{{cite web|url=https://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13682818.html|volume=12/1993|title=Einsamer Wolf unter W\u00f6lfen|work=Eine Moskauer Personalakte der Kommunistischen Internationale erhellt das Bild Herbert Wehners, der nach dem Krieg zum SPD-Vizevorsitzenden und Minister aufstieg.

Over the next few weeks the [[Communist Party of Germany |Communist party]] was outlawed and those of its leaders who had not already gone into hiding or emigrated were rounded up by the [[Gestapo|security services]].  On 7 February 1933 Schehr was one of the participants at the [[:de:Sporthaus Ziegenhals|\"illegal\" Sporthaus Ziegenhals meeting]] held just outside Berlin, and celebrated subsequently (especially during the \"East German\" years) as the last meeting held by the German Communist Party leadership before the participants were arrested and killed, or in some cases managed to escape abroad.<ref name= JSlautFreundeskreisET/><ref name= ZiegenhalsTeilnehmer>{{cite web |  url=http://www.etg-ziegenhals.de/Teilnehmer.html | title= Teilnehmer an der Tagung des ZK der KPD am 07.

It was believed that information gathered and passed on to his handlers by Kattner had enabled the Gestapo to arrest John Schehr, among others.  Kattner's role became known to comrades through the underground press during January 1934 and, after attempts to have him kidnapped and spirited away to Moscow had failed, on 1 February 1934 [[:de:Alfred Kattner|Alfred Kattner]] was shot dead by a party official called [[:de:Hans Schwarz (Parteifunktion\u00e4r)|Hans Schwarz]] in his [[:de:Nowawes|Nowawes]] apartment just outside Berlin.

After the [[Second World War|war]] and the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi nightmare]] were over, on 11 August 1947, with Berlin divided into military zones of occupation, a clandestine operation was undertaken from the [[Soviet occupation zone]].   This involved the kidnapping from what was becoming known as \"West Berlin\" of Sattler, who was smuggled across to the east and secretly sentenced to life imprisonment.   He was officially (but incorrectly) declared dead in 1949.   Although John Schehr and his three fellow victims became heroic figures in the [[Soviet occupation zone]] (relaunched in 1949 as [[East Germany|the German Democratic Republic / \"East Germany\")]], the kidnapping and sentencing of their killer never made it to the national schools curriculum.   Sattler served his sentence and on 15 October 1972 died in prison, aged 74, under circumstances that were never entirely clear.   His youngest daughter, who had been born in 1942, and with her family had escaped to [[West Germany]] after a final cuddle from her father in 1945, grew up convinced that her father was a good man tradduced by Soviet propaganda.  After [[German reunification| reunification]] she was keen to press for his rehabilitation.   She was able to undertake extensive research in the scrupulously maintained files that the [[Stasi|East German security services]] had compiled and maintained during the intervening decades, and she was forced to accept not just that her father was the man who had murdered \"John Schehr\" and his comrades, but that this had been just the first in a succession of escalating atrocities for which Bruno Sattler had been responsible during the [[Nazi Germany|twelve Nazi years]].

Without intending it, he found himself promoted to the rank of a [[Unteroffizier|\"sub-officer\" (''\"Unteroffizier\"'')]].   It is recorded that during one retreat he skilfully led his troops so that they avoided capture.   His brother Walter Schehr was killed in action in 1916.<ref name=JSlautFS/>   The 1914 decision of the party leadership to [[Burgfriedenspolitik|vote in favour]] of [[War bond|war funding]] and forego criticism of the government for the duration of hostilities during the [[First World War|war]] had been contentious among party activists from the outset, and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] finally split over the issue of support for the war in 1917.   John Schehr, like his mentor [[Ernst Th\u00e4lmann]], was one of a large number of mainly left-wing party members who moved across to the breakaway [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany|Independent Social Democratic Party (''\" Unabh\u00e4ngige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\"'' / USPD)]].<ref name=JSlauHDK/><ref name=JSlautFS/>   After the war there was no immediate return to his skilled work, but [[Port of Hamburg|the docks]] continued to function and he joined his brother Franz in work as a [[stevedore]] till 1924.<ref name=JSlautFS/>   In 1919 when, in its turn, the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany|USPD)]], [[Ernst Th\u00e4lmann |Th\u00e4lmann]] and Schehr, were among the early recruits to the newly launched [[Communist Party of Germany |Communist Party]] in the wake of the so-called [[German Revolution of 1918\u20131919 |November revolutions]].<ref name=JSlautGDW/>    Almost all the USPD activists in the Hamburg district made the same move, which can be seen in large measure as a tribute to Ernst Th\u00e4lmann's oratorical and political powers of persuasion.   Schehr quickly became an energetic party activist:  his brother recalled later that during the early 1920s he was out almost every evening, undertaking party work.<ref name=JSlautFS/>   \n\n=== From party activist to party officer ===\n1923 was a year of [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|intensified destitution]] across [[Weimar Germany|Germany]], and a number of [[Cuno strikes|major disturbances]].  In Hamburg Schehr took part in the storming the [[Ottensen]] police station, which was one of police stations in and around Hamburg attacked on 23 October in the context of that year's  [[Hamburg Uprising|October uprising]], carefully planned and choreographed by Ernst Th\u00e4lmann on behalf of [[Communist Party of Germany |the party]].<ref name=JSlautFS/>   In 1924 Schehr became a party \"Polleiter\" (''loosely, \"policy head\"'') for [[Altona, Hamburg| Altona]] where he was already, by this time, a municipal councillor.<ref name=JSlauHDK/>   He also regained his skilled work [[Port of Hamburg|on the docks]].   The next year he accepted a fulltime job working within [[Communist Party of Germany |the party]] apparatus, however.<ref name=JSlauHDK/>   It is clear that John Schehr's advancement in the national party over the next few years owed much to the friendship and political patronage of [[Ernst Th\u00e4lmann]], but he evidently had many friends and admirers among local party activists.   A particular friend and political ally was [[:de:Etkar Andr\u00e9 |Etkar Andr\u00e9]].<ref name=JSlautFS/> \n\n=== Party advancement ===\nIt was nevertheless more likely to have been as a result, primarily, of [[Ernst Th\u00e4lmann|Th\u00e4lmann's]] backing that in 1925, at the tenth party congress, John Schehr was elected to membership of the party appeal's commission (''\"Beschwerdekommissio\"'').   The same congress also voted Schehr onto the list of candidates for [[:de:Liste der Mitglieder der Zentralkomitees der KPD|the Party Central Committee]].<ref name=JSlauHDK/>   The dire economic situation during the early 1920s made this a period of expansion for the [[Communist Party of Germany |communists]] in the industrial regions, and during 1925 John Schehr was appointed to lead the party organisation in the recently established [[Harburg-Wilhelmsburg]] sub-district (''\"Unterbezirksleiter\"'') in succession to [[:de:Johann Skjellerup |Johann Skjellerup]].<ref name=JSlauHDK/><ref name=UBLinHWlautCG/>   The appointment was of short duration, however, since in March 1926 the fulltime paid position was abolished, possibly to save money and possibly in response to a decline in party membership locally.<ref name=UBLinHWlautCG>{{cite web|url=http://www.harbuch.de/frische-themen-artikel/radli3.html|title=Die radikale Linke in Harburg-Wilhelmsburg|work=Nachtrag 2: Organisatorische St\u00e4rken und Schw\u00e4chen, interne Fraktionsk\u00e4mpfe 1924-1931|publisher=Dr. Christian Gotthardt, Hamburg|author=Christian Gotthardt|date=April 2018|accessdate=23 April 2020}}</ref>   In 1927 he was appointed \"Orgleiter\" (''loosely \"Head of Administration\"'') for the party's important Hamburg-Wasserkante district (to the west and north of Hamburg),<ref name=JSlautGDW/><ref name=\"EvansGeary2015\">{{cite book|author1=Anthony McElligott (author) |author2=Dick Geary (compiler-editor)|title=Mobilising the unemployed:  the KPD and the Unemployed Workers' Movement in Hamburg-Altona during the Weimar Republic|work=The German Unemployed (Routledge Revivals): Experiences and Consequences of Mass Unemployment from the Weimar Republic to the Third Reich|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SUfLCQAAQBAJ&pg=PT289 |date=5 June 2015|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-317-54203-2|pages=288\u2013294}}</ref> thereby becoming a key member of the regional party executive under the leadership of regional party secretary [[:de:John Wittorf |John Wittorf]].<ref name=JSlauHDK/>\n\n=== Wittorf affair ===\nAlso in 1927 Schehr was again a delegate at the party's eleventh party congress, held that year in [[Essen]].   Again he was voted onto the list of candidates for [[:de:Liste der Mitglieder der Zentralkomitees der KPD |the Party Central Committee]].<ref name=JSlauHDK/>   As a member of the Control Commission for the Hamburg-Wasserkante party organisation, Schehr was implicated in concealing the embezzlement of party funds by [[:de:John Wittorf |John Wittorf]] during the course of a scandal that blew up in 1928.  [[Ernst Th\u00e4lmann]] was, by some criteria, more heavily and directly implicated, and he was indeed briefly ousted from the [[Central Committee|party Central Committee]], but [[Joseph Stalin]], whose influence over the [[Communist Party of Germany|German party leadership]] was immense, intervened to have Th\u00e4lmann reinstated.   From now on Th\u00e4lmann was seen by party comrades as [[Stalinism|\"Stalin's man\"]]:  it did his career no harm.<ref name=ETlauHDK>{{cite web|title= Th\u00e4lmann, Ernst  * 16.4.1886  \u2020  18.8.1944|work=Handbuch der Deutschen Kommunisten| author1=[[Hermann Weber]]|author2=[[Andreas Herbst]] |url= https://www.bundesstiftung-aufarbeitung.de/de/recherche/kataloge-datenbanken/biographische-datenbanken/ernst-thaelmann |publisher=Karl Dietz Verlag, Berlin & Bundesstiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED-Diktatur, Berlin| accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref>   There was no intervention with such immediate impact on behalf of John Schehr who was stripped of all his party functions in October 1928.   There were even demands for Schehr to be excluded from the party, but that did not happen.<ref name=JSlauHDK/>\n\n=== Political recovery and advancement ===\nFollowing [[Ernst Th\u00e4lmann]]'s rehabilitation Schehr, as Th\u00e4lmann's respected prot\u00e9g\u00e9, quickly recovered his position in the party.  He was reinstated as [[Communist Party of Germany|party]] \"Orgleiter\" for the  Hamburg-Wasserkante district, retaining the post till March 1930.   In 1929, at the eleventh party congress (held in [[Wedding (Berlin)|Berlin-Wedding]]) Schehr was again present as a delegate, and he was yet again included on the candidates list for [[:de:Liste der Mitglieder der Zentralkomitees der KPD |Central Committee membership]].<ref name=JSlauHDK/><ref>Protokoll XII.

Meanwhile a return to widespread economic austerity, as [[Weimar Germany|Germany]] worked through the savage backwash from the [[Great depression]], was creating a surge across Germany in support for the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]].   This was accompanied by increasing political polarisation leading, after [[July 1932 German federal election|1932]], to deadlock in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag (''national parliament'')]] whereby coalition with on or other of the two populist parties, the [[Nazi Party|National Socialists]] and the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communists]] was mathematically necessary for the more moderate parties to coalesce to form a majority coalition, but both extremist parties were unacceptable coaliation parties either for the moderate parties or form each other.   It was in the resulting context of intensifying crisis that in April 1932 John Schehr was elected to [[:de:Liste der Mitglieder des Landtages (Freistaat Preu\u00dfen) (4. Wahlperiode)|membership]] of the [[Landtag of Prussia|Prussian Landtag (''regional parliament'')]] in [[Berlin]].<ref name=JSlauHDK/>   Three months later, in [[July 1932 German federal election|July 1932]], he was elected to the  [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]].<ref name=JSlautDieLinke/>   (His [[Landtag of Prussia|Landtag]] seat was taken over by his party comrade [[:de:August T\u00fcnnermann|August T\u00fcnnermann]].<ref name=ATlauHDK>{{cite web|title=T\u00fcnnermann, August   * 18.8.1896   \u2020 23.12.1982 |work=Handbuch der Deutschen Kommunisten| author1= [[Hermann Weber]]|author2=[[Andreas Herbst]] |url= https://www.bundesstiftung-aufarbeitung.de/de/recherche/kataloge-datenbanken/biographische-datenbanken/ernst-thaelmann |publisher=Karl Dietz Verlag, Berlin & Bundesstiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED-Diktatur, Berlin| accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref>)\n\nWithin the party Schehr's career continued to advance.   During the middle of 1932 he finally became a member of the [[Communist Party of Germany|party]] [[Central Committee]].   This came about not through any vote of delegates at a party congress, but as a result of being co-opted into membership by the existing members.   He relocated to [[Berlin]], becoming both secretary to the Central Committee and a member of its inner caucus, the Politburo.   Schehr was now, in all but name, deputy to the party leader, [[Ernst Th\u00e4lmann]].   His position in the party aparatus was further strengthened after [[Heinz Neumann]] was stripped of his party funcations and then officially condemned by the leadership in November 1932 and sent as a comintern emissary to [[Spain]].   (Neumann had clashed with Th\u00e4lmann whom he believed, along with [[Joseph Stalin]], was dangerously underestimating the strength of the threat presented by [[Adolf Hitler]].<ref name=HNlauHDK>{{cite web| title=Neumann, Heinz  * 6.7.1902   \u2020 26.11.1937  |work=Handbuch der Deutschen Kommunisten| author1= [[Hermann Weber]]|author2= [[Andreas Herbst]] |url= https://www.bundesstiftung-aufarbeitung.de/de/recherche/kataloge-datenbanken/biographische-datenbanken/heinz-neumann |publisher= Karl Dietz Verlag, Berlin & Bundesstiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED-Diktatur, Berlin| accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref>)\n\nIt was probably in October or November 1932 that the police arrested John Schehr  and discovered \"important material\" concerning the [[Communist Party of Germany|party's]] illegal structures (which included a semi-secret quasi-military operation across the nation and a large \"political\" espionage network on a scale normally associated with foreign governments rather than with domestic political parties).<ref name=JSlauHDK/>   The arrest was apparently made \"because of an instruction from the Ministry of Defence\".<ref name=spiegel12993>{{cite web|url=https://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13682818.html|volume=12/1993|title=Einsamer Wolf unter W\u00f6lfen|work=Eine Moskauer Personalakte der Kommunistischen Internationale erhellt das Bild Herbert Wehners, der nach dem Krieg zum SPD-Vizevorsitzenden und Minister aufstieg.

Regardless of the legal basis for the arrest (which remains vague and unclear), as a member of the  [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag (''national parliament'')]] till some months after the [[Machtergreifung |r\u00e9gime change]] in 1933, John Schehr enjoyed certain privileges, and it would appear to have been on account of these that on this occasion his release came so swiftly.<ref name=JSlauHDK/> \n\n=== R\u00e9gime change ===\nThe [[Hitler cabinet|Hitler government]] exploited the continuing parliamentary and political deadlock to [[Machtergreifung |take power]] in January 1933.

Over the next few weeks the [[Communist Party of Germany |Communist party]] was outlawed and those of its leaders who had not already gone into hiding or emigrated were rounded up by the [[Gestapo|security services]].  On 7 February 1933 Schehr was one of the participants at the [[:de:Sporthaus Ziegenhals|\"illegal\" Sporthaus Ziegenhals meeting]] held just outside Berlin, and celebrated subsequently (especially during the \"East German\" years) as the last meeting held by the German Communist Party leadership before the participants were arrested and killed, or in some cases managed to escape abroad.<ref name= JSlautFreundeskreisET/><ref name= ZiegenhalsTeilnehmer>{{cite web |  url=http://www.etg-ziegenhals.de/Teilnehmer.html | title= Teilnehmer an der Tagung des ZK der KPD am 07.

It was believed that information gathered and passed on to his handlers by Kattner had enabled the Gestapo to arrest John Schehr, among others.  Kattner's role became known to comrades through the underground press during January 1934 and, after attempts to have him kidnapped and spirited away to Moscow had failed, on 1 February 1934 [[:de:Alfred Kattner|Alfred Kattner]] was shot dead by a party official called [[:de:Hans Schwarz (Parteifunktion\u00e4r)|Hans Schwarz]] in his [[:de:Nowawes|Nowawes]] apartment just outside Berlin.

After the [[Second World War|war]] and the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi nightmare]] were over, on 11 August 1947, with Berlin divided into military zones of occupation, a clandestine operation was undertaken from the [[Soviet occupation zone]].   This involved the kidnapping from what was becoming known as \"West Berlin\" of Sattler, who was smuggled across to the east and secretly sentenced to life imprisonment.   He was officially (but incorrectly) declared dead in 1949.   Although John Schehr and his three fellow victims became heroic figures in the [[Soviet occupation zone]] (relaunched in 1949 as [[East Germany|the German Democratic Republic / \"East Germany\")]], the kidnapping and sentencing of their killer never made it to the national schools curriculum.   Sattler served his sentence and on 15 October 1972 died in prison, aged 74, under circumstances that were never entirely clear.   His youngest daughter, who had been born in 1942, and with her family had escaped to [[West Germany]] after a final cuddle from her father in 1945, grew up convinced that her father was a good man tradduced by Soviet propaganda.  After [[German reunification| reunification]] she was keen to press for his rehabilitation.   She was able to undertake extensive research in the scrupulously maintained files that the [[Stasi|East German security services]] had compiled and maintained during the intervening decades, and she was forced to accept not just that her father was the man who had murdered \"John Schehr\" and his comrades, but that this had been just the first in a succession of escalating atrocities for which Bruno Sattler had been responsible during the [[Nazi Germany|twelve Nazi years]].   In its own terms it had all amounted to a highly successful career as a senior [[Gestapo]] officer.<ref name=BSlautUG>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130304112709/http://www.mdr.de/mdr-figaro/hoerspiel/feature/johnschehr100.html|date=1 March 2013|title=John Schehr und Genossen - Ein Mord, ein Mythos und die Folgen|author=Udo Grashoff|work=mdr Figaro: Kulturradio| publisher=[[Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk]], Leipzig|accessdate=25 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=BSlautSpiegelLon>{{cite web| title=Beate Niemann: My father was an evil Nazi killer|work=When Beate Niemann was a little girl, her mother always told her the father who vanished when she was a toddler was a man to be proud of.|date=9 March 2011|url= https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/beate-niemann-my-father-was-an-evil-nazi-115062|publisher=[[Daily Mirror]], London|accessdate=25 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== John Schehr und Genossen ==\nIt is not known precisely when [[Erich Weinert]] wrote his [[ballad|ballad-style]] poem \"John Schehr und Genossen\" (''\"John Schehr and comrades\"''), but it appears to have been written very soon after the killings became public knowledge, probably during 1934.
