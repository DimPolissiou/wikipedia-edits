The Index was first launched in May 2009, with subsequent reports being released annually. In 2015 it ranked 165 countries, up from 121 in 2007. The study was conceived by Australian technology entrepreneur [[Steve Killelea]], and is endorsed by individuals such as former UN Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]], [[14th Dalai Lama|the Dalai Lama]], archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]], former President of Finland and 2008 Nobel Peace Prize laureate [[Martti Ahtisaari]], Nobel laureate [[Muhammad Yunus]], economist [[Jeffrey Sachs]], former president of Ireland [[Mary Robinson]], former Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations [[Jan Eliasson]] and former United States president [[Jimmy Carter]]. The updated index is released each year at events in London, Washington, DC; and at the United Nations Secretariat in New York.\n\nThe 2019 GPI indicates [[Iceland]], [[New Zealand]], [[Portugal]], [[Austria]] and [[Denmark]] to be the most peaceful countries and [[Somalia]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Syria]], [[South Sudan]], [[Yemen]], and [[Iraq]]  to be the least peaceful.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://visionofhumanity.org/indexes/global-peace-index/|title=Global Peace Index Map|last=Institute for Economics and Peace|first=|date=|work=Vision of Humanity|access-date=2019-06-12|language=en-US}}</ref> Long-term findings of the 2017 GPI include a less peaceful world over the past decade, a 2.14 per cent deterioration in the global level of peace in the past decade, growing inequality in peace between the most and least peaceful countries, a long-term reduction in the GPI Militarization domain, and a widening impact of terrorism, with historically high numbers of people killed in terrorist incidents over the past 10 years.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== International panel ==\nThe international panel for the 2016 and 2017 GPI consisted of:\n\n* [[Kevin P. Clements|Professor Kevin P. Clements]], ''Foundation Chair of Peace and Conflict Studies and Director, National Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies, University of Otago, New Zealand''\n* [[Sabina Alkire|Dr Sabina Alkire]], ''Director, Oxford Poverty & Human Development Initiative (OPHI), University of Oxford, United Kingdom''\n* Dr Ian Anthony, ''Research Coordinator and Director of the Programme on Arms Control, Disarmament and Non-proliferation, Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), Sweden''\n* Ms Isabelle Arrandon, ''Director of Research and Deputy Director of Communications & Outreach, International Crisis Group, Belgium''\n* Dr Manuela Mesa, ''Director, Centre for Education and Peace Research (CEIPAZ) and President, Spanish Association for Peace Research (AIPAZ), Madrid, Spain''\n* Mr Nick Grono, ''CEO, The Freedom Fund, United Kingdom''\n* Dr Ekaterina Stepanova, ''Head, Unit on Peace and Conflict Studies, Institute of the World Economy and International Relations (IMEMO), Russian Academy of Sciences, Russia''\n\n== Methodology ==\nIn assessing peacefulness, the GPI investigates the extent to which countries are involved in ongoing domestic and international conflicts. It also seeks to evaluate the level of harmony or discord within a nation; ten indicators broadly assess what might be described as a safety and security in society. The assertion is that low crime rates, minimal incidences of terrorist acts and violent demonstrations, harmonious relations with neighboring countries, a stable political scene and a small proportion of the population being internally displaced or refugees can be suggestive of peacefulness.\n\nIn 2017, 23 indicators were used to establish each country's peacefulness score. The indicators were originally selected with the assistance of an expert panel in 2007 and are reviewed by the expert panel on an annual basis. The scores for each indicator are normalized on a scale of 1\u20135, whereby qualitative indicators are banded into five groupings and quantitative ones are scored from 1\u20135, to the third decimal point.

The 0 to 1 scores that resulted were then converted to the 1 to 5 scale. Individual indicators were then weighted according to the expert panel's judgment of their importance. The scores were then tabulated into two weighted sub-indices: internal peace, weighted at 60% of a country's final score, and external peace, weighted at 40% of a country's final score. \u2018Negative Peace\u2019 which is defined as the absence of violence, or fear of violence is used as the definition of peace to create the Global Peace Index. An additional aim of the GPI database is to facilitate deeper study of the concept of positive peace, or those attitudes, institutions, and structures that drive peacefulness in society. The GPI also examines relationships between peace and reliable international measures, including democracy and transparency, education and material well-being. As such, it seeks to understand the relative importance of a range of potential determinants, or \"drivers\", which may influence the nurturing of peaceful societies, both internally and externally.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://visionofhumanity.org/app/uploads/2017/06/GPI17-Report.pdf|title=Global Peace Index Report, Methodology, pg. 113\u2013136|last=Institute for Economics and Peace|date=|website=Visionofhumanity.org|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe main findings of the 2017 Global Peace Index are:<ref name=\":0\" />\n* The overall score for the 2017 GPI improved slightly this year due to gains in six of the nine geographical regions represented. More countries improved their levels of peacefulness, than deteriorated: 93 compared to 68.\n* Peacebuilding activities can be highly cost-effective, providing cost savings 16 times the cost of the intervention.\n* The global economic impact of violence was $14.3 trillion PPP in 2016, equivalent to 12.6 per cent of global GDP, or $1,953 per person. \n*  In Low-Peace environments, the factors that matter the most are related to Well-Functioning Government, Low Levels of Corruption, Acceptance of the Rights of Others and Good Relations with Neighbours\n* Due to armed conflict in MENA, many related indicators such as deaths from internal conflict, number of refugees and IDPs, and organised internal conflict are at high levels.\n* Safety and Security improved due to many countries recording a lower homicide rate and lower levels of political terror.\n\nStatistical analysis is applied to GPI data to uncover specific conditions conducive of peace. Researchers have determined that Positive Peace, which includes the attitudes, institutions, and structures that pre-empt conflict and facilitate functional societies, is the main driver of peace. The eight pillars of positive peace are well-functioning government, sound business environment, acceptance of the rights of others, good relations with neighbors, free flow of information, high levels of human capital, low levels of corruption, and equitable distribution of resources. Well-functioning government, low levels of corruption, acceptance of the rights of others and good relations with neighbours are more important in countries suffering from high levels of violence. Free flow of information and sound business environment become more important when a country is approaching the global average level of peacefulness, also described as the Mid-Peace level. Low levels of corruption is the only Pillar that is strongly significant across all three levels of peacefulness. This suggests it is an important transformational factor at all stages of nations\u2019 development.\n\n== Global Peace Index rankings (2008\u20132019) ==\nNations considered more peaceful have lower index scores. In 2013 researchers at the Institute for Economics and Peace harmonized the Global Peace Index database to ensure that the scores were comparable over time. The GPI Expert Panel decided that the Index would include nations and territories, but not [[Ministate|micro-states]]. Countries covered by the GPI must either have a population of more than 1 million or a land area greater than 20,000 square kilometers.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n<!-- Note that if you want to update this

Professor [[Jeffrey Sachs]], Director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University said: \"The GPI continues its pioneering work in drawing the world\u2019s attention to the massive resources we are squandering in violence and conflict. The lives and money wasted in wars, incarcerations, weapons systems, weapons trade, and more, could be directed to ending poverty, promoting education, and protecting the environment.

The Index was first launched in May 2009, with subsequent reports being released annually. In 2015 it ranked 165 countries, up from 121 in 2007. The study was conceived by Australian technology entrepreneur [[Steve Killelea]], and is endorsed by individuals such as former UN Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]], [[14th Dalai Lama|the Dalai Lama]], archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]], former President of Finland and 2008 Nobel Peace Prize laureate [[Martti Ahtisaari]], Nobel laureate [[Muhammad Yunus]], economist [[Jeffrey Sachs]], former president of Ireland [[Mary Robinson]], former Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations [[Jan Eliasson]] and former United States president [[Jimmy Carter]]. The updated index is released each year at events in London, Washington, DC; and at the United Nations Secretariat in New York.\n\nThe 2019 GPI indicates [[Iceland]], [[New Zealand]], [[Portugal]], [[Austria]] and [[Denmark]] to be the most peaceful countries and [[Somalia]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Syria]], [[South Sudan]], [[Yemen]], and [[Iraq]]  to be the least peaceful.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://visionofhumanity.org/indexes/global-peace-index/|title=Global Peace Index Map|last=Institute for Economics and Peace|first=|date=|work=Vision of Humanity|access-date=2019-06-12|language=en-US}}</ref> Long-term findings of the 2017 GPI include a less peaceful world over the past decade, a 2.14 per cent deterioration in the global level of peace in the past decade, growing inequality in peace between the most and least peaceful countries, a long-term reduction in the GPI Militarization domain, and a widening impact of terrorism, with historically high numbers of people killed in terrorist incidents over the past 10 years.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== International panel ==\nThe international panel for the 2016 and 2017 GPI consisted of:\n\n* [[Kevin P.

It also seeks to evaluate the level of harmony or discord within a nation; ten indicators broadly assess what might be described as a safety and security in society. The assertion is that low crime rates, minimal incidences of terrorist acts and violent demonstrations, harmonious relations with neighboring countries, a stable political scene and a small proportion of the population being internally displaced or refugees can be suggestive of peacefulness.\n\nIn 2017, 23 indicators were used to establish each country's peacefulness score. The indicators were originally selected with the assistance of an expert panel in 2007 and are reviewed by the expert panel on an annual basis. The scores for each indicator are normalized on a scale of 1\u20135, whereby qualitative indicators are banded into five groupings and quantitative ones are scored from 1\u20135, to the third decimal point.

The 0 to 1 scores that resulted were then converted to the 1 to 5 scale. Individual indicators were then weighted according to the expert panel's judgment of their importance. The scores were then tabulated into two weighted sub-indices: internal peace, weighted at 60% of a country's final score, and external peace, weighted at 40% of a country's final score. \u2018Negative Peace\u2019 which is defined as the absence of violence, or fear of violence is used as the definition of peace to create the Global Peace Index. An additional aim of the GPI database is to facilitate deeper study of the concept of positive peace, or those attitudes, institutions, and structures that drive peacefulness in society. The GPI also examines relationships between peace and reliable international measures, including democracy and transparency, education and material well-being. As such, it seeks to understand the relative importance of a range of potential determinants, or \"drivers\", which may influence the nurturing of peaceful societies, both internally and externally.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://visionofhumanity.org/app/uploads/2017/06/GPI17-Report.pdf|title=Global Peace Index Report, Methodology, pg. 113\u2013136|last=Institute for Economics and Peace|date=|website=Visionofhumanity.org|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe main findings of the 2017 Global Peace Index are:<ref name=\":0\" />\n* The overall score for the 2017 GPI improved slightly this year due to gains in six of the nine geographical regions represented. More countries improved their levels of peacefulness, than deteriorated: 93 compared to 68.\n* Peacebuilding activities can be highly cost-effective, providing cost savings 16 times the cost of the intervention.\n* The global economic impact of violence was $14.3 trillion PPP in 2016, equivalent to 12.6 per cent of global GDP, or $1,953 per person. \n*  In Low-Peace environments, the factors that matter the most are related to Well-Functioning Government, Low Levels of Corruption, Acceptance of the Rights of Others and Good Relations with Neighbours\n* Due to armed conflict in MENA, many related indicators such as deaths from internal conflict, number of refugees and IDPs, and organised internal conflict are at high levels.\n* Safety and Security improved due to many countries recording a lower homicide rate and lower levels of political terror.\n\nStatistical analysis is applied to GPI data to uncover specific conditions conducive of peace. Researchers have determined that Positive Peace, which includes the attitudes, institutions, and structures that pre-empt conflict and facilitate functional societies, is the main driver of peace. The eight pillars of positive peace are well-functioning government, sound business environment, acceptance of the rights of others, good relations with neighbors, free flow of information, high levels of human capital, low levels of corruption, and equitable distribution of resources. Well-functioning government, low levels of corruption, acceptance of the rights of others and good relations with neighbours are more important in countries suffering from high levels of violence. Free flow of information and sound business environment become more important when a country is approaching the global average level of peacefulness, also described as the Mid-Peace level. Low levels of corruption is the only Pillar that is strongly significant across all three levels of peacefulness. This suggests it is an important transformational factor at all stages of nations\u2019 development.\n\n== Global Peace Index rankings (2008\u20132019) ==\nNations considered more peaceful have lower index scores. In 2013 researchers at the Institute for Economics and Peace harmonized the Global Peace Index database to ensure that the scores were comparable over time. The GPI Expert Panel decided that the Index would include nations and territories, but not [[Ministate|micro-states]]. Countries covered by the GPI must either have a population of more than 1 million or a land area greater than 20,000 square kilometers.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n<!-- Note that if you want to update this

Professor [[Jeffrey Sachs]], Director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University said: \"The GPI continues its pioneering work in drawing the world\u2019s attention to the massive resources we are squandering in violence and conflict. The lives and money wasted in wars, incarcerations, weapons systems, weapons trade, and more, could be directed to ending poverty, promoting education, and protecting the environment.

It became extremely popular, running through 18 editions in fifty years.\n\nIt was the first cookery book to be published in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] of America: it was printed in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]], in 1742. It contained the first published recipe for \"[[ketchup|katchup]]\", and appears to be the earliest source for [[bread and butter pudding]].\n\nThe book includes recipes not only for foods but for wines, cordial-waters, medicines and salves.\n\n==Book==\n\nThe title page describes ''The Compleat Housewife'' as a\n\n{{quote|collection of several hundred of the most approved receipts, in cookery, pastry, confectionery, preserving, pickles, cakes, creams, jellies, made wines, cordials.

There are no lists of ingredients, these simply being mentioned as needed in the recipes. Most recipes do not mention either oven temperature or cooking time, though for example \"To candy Orange Flowers\" instructs \"set your glasses in a stove with a moderate heat\",<ref>Smith, 1739. Page 206.</ref> and \"To Stew a Rump of Beef\" states \"this requires six or seven hours stewing.\"<ref>Smith, 1739.

Yet, she observes, the English housewife had many varieties of vegetables, 30 kinds of seafood and 35 kinds of poultry (including hares and rabbits). She notes that the book also describes home remedies, the housewife having to function as \" chef, doctor, pharmacist, exterminator, chemist, laundress, and all-around handy-woman.\" Reflecting that the recipes would \"probably never\" be used today, and the medicines are useless, the book remains invaluable for researchers, gives readers a glimpse into the world of [[Jane Austen]] and her contemporaries, and richly documents eighteenth-century English life.<ref name=JASNA>{{cite journal |last1=Mitchell |first1=Christine M. |title=Book Review: The Handy Homemaker, Eighteenth-Century Style |url=http://www.jasna.org/bookrev/br261p22.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010004203/http://jasna.org/bookrev/br261p22.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=10 October 2010 |journal=JASNA News |issue=Spring 2010 |accessdate=26 March 2015 }}</ref>\n\nPatrick Spedding, in ''Script & Print'', notes that the book was very popular in the eighteenth century, with 20 London editions in fifty years.

There are no lists of ingredients, these simply being mentioned as needed in the recipes. Most recipes do not mention either oven temperature or cooking time, though for example \"To candy Orange Flowers\" instructs \"set your glasses in a stove with a moderate heat\",<ref>Smith, 1739. Page 206.</ref> and \"To Stew a Rump of Beef\" states \"this requires six or seven hours stewing.\"<ref>Smith, 1739. Pages 6\u20137.</ref>\n\nThe recipes are predominantly English, but dishes include French and other foreign names, and imported ingredients such as spices.\n\n[[File:Compleat Housewife - A Battalia Pye.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4<!--size for small print sample-->|Recipe for [[Battalia pie|battalia pye]] from Eliza Smith's ''The Compleat Housewife'', 9th edition, 1739.]]\nRecipes are described tersely, and do not generally spell out basic techniques such as how to make pastry; the recipe for \"A [[Battalia pie|Battalia Pye]]\"{{efn|The name means a pie filled with ''beatilles'', small blessed objects (Latin ''beatus'', blessed) such as, according to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], \"Cocks-combs, Goose-gibbets, Ghizzards, Livers, and other Appurtenances of Fowls (1706)\".

Yet, she observes, the English housewife had many varieties of vegetables, 30 kinds of seafood and 35 kinds of poultry (including hares and rabbits). She notes that the book also describes home remedies, the housewife having to function as \" chef, doctor, pharmacist, exterminator, chemist, laundress, and all-around handy-woman.\" Reflecting that the recipes would \"probably never\" be used today, and the medicines are useless, the book remains invaluable for researchers, gives readers a glimpse into the world of [[Jane Austen]] and her contemporaries, and richly documents eighteenth-century English life.<ref name=JASNA>{{cite journal |last1=Mitchell |first1=Christine M. |title=Book Review: The Handy Homemaker, Eighteenth-Century Style |url=http://www.jasna.org/bookrev/br261p22.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010004203/http://jasna.org/bookrev/br261p22.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=10 October 2010 |journal=JASNA News |issue=Spring 2010 |accessdate=26 March 2015 }}</ref>\n\nPatrick Spedding, in ''Script & Print'', notes that the book was very popular in the eighteenth century, with 20 London editions in fifty years.

Both are fearful that he will be sent to fight in the [[Portuguese Colonial War]]. Late and depressed, Rosa then travels by [[Trams in Lisbon|tram]] to Ant\u00f3nia's flat to babysit for her daughter Amelia. On arriving back (late) at his base, Daniel is oblivious to the imminent [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]]. Captain [[Salgueiro Maia]] arrests the base commander at gunpoint and orders the soldiers to assemble on parade in the middle of the night; he asks them to come with him to Lisbon to overthrow the government. Maia's erudite but cynical and cautious colleague Major Gervasio refuses to take part, as does Lieutenant Lob\u00e3o.\n\nMeanwhile, in [[Lisbon]], left-wing journalist/lecturer Antonia is having a row with her estranged husband Manuel, a [[Portuguese Army]] captain, over atrocities he has been involved with during the Colonial War. Rosa having arrived to babysit, Antonia then goes to a formal reception where she pleads with her brother (Filipe Correia), a minister in the government, to release one of her students who had been arrested by the [[PIDE#DGS|DGS (secret police)]]. Filipe refuses to help and returns to his conversation with Brigadier Pais. The head of the DGS (Salieri) is also present at the reception; he recognises Antonia and subsequently assaults her in a toilet. Ant\u00f3nia returns home in despair, not realising that her estranged husband Manuel is also a coup plotter. Manuel and his colleague prepare to seize control of the R\u00e1dio Clube Portugu\u00eas, a radio station, from which communiques on behalf of the [[Armed Forces Movement]] will be broadcast.\n\nMeanwhile, simultaneously, Maia and his troops are preparing to set off for Lisbon, and the other coup plotters are also preparing to move into position. The signal for the coup to start is the playing of [[Grandola, Vila Morena]] on the radio shortly after midnight on 25 April. Maia's troops set off in a column of armoured vehicles. Manuel, Fonseca, Botelho and Silva capture the R\u00e1dio Clube Portugu\u00eas in Lisbon. A signal is given by morse code by car headlights to prisoners being held in prison by the DGS. Maia's armoured column has to stop in open countryside due to a breakdown by one of the key armoured vehicles; at this point Major Gervasio arrives in a conspicuous red sports car and joins the rebels. Maia's troops arrive in the [[Pra\u00e7a do Com\u00e9rcio]] in Lisbon, but are threatened by a naval warship and by a column of tanks commanded by Brigadier Pais (who remains loyal to the regime). Following a stand-off, with Lab\u00e3o and Maia both threatened with being shot, many of Pais' troops defect to the rebels. On entering the Government offices in the Praca do Comercio, Maia discovers that the ministers have fled to the [[Republican National Guard (Portugal)|GNR]] headquarters at [[Carmo Convent (Lisbon)|Carmo]] in Lisbon. There are several asides, including where the young conscript soldier in the opening scenes of the film meets Rosa again, placing a carnation in the barrel of his rifle (and are later discovered inside a military armoured car whilst making love).\n\nAt the GNR barracks, a further stand-off ensues, with the regime leaders (including [[Marcelo Caetano]]) trapped inside. Also trapped in their nearby headquarters, a group of DGS officers open fire from the windows at the crowd in the street outside, killing four - the only fatalities of the Carnation Revolution. Virgilio is one of the casualties. Maia eventually ordering his troops to shoot at the building with machine-gun fire. Following this atrocity, Maia threatens to blow up the building with artillery.\n\nShortly before Maia's deadline expires, emissaries from General [[Ant\u00f3nio de Sp\u00ednola]] arrive, to negotiate the surrender of the regime's leaders. Spinola himself arrives, places Gerv\u00e1sio in local command (despite having spent almost the entire day avoiding any action) and orders Maia to convey the arrested Caetano, Correira and the other leaders to an air force base, from whence they are flown to [[Madeira]] and then on to exile in Brazil.

Both are fearful that he will be sent to fight in the [[Portuguese Colonial War]]. Late and depressed, Rosa then travels by [[Trams in Lisbon|tram]] to Ant\u00f3nia's flat to babysit for her daughter Amelia. On arriving back (late) at his base, Daniel is oblivious to the imminent [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]]. Captain [[Salgueiro Maia]] arrests the base commander at gunpoint and orders the soldiers to assemble on parade in the middle of the night; he asks them to come with him to Lisbon to overthrow the government. Maia's erudite but cynical and cautious colleague Major Gervasio refuses to take part, as does Lieutenant Lob\u00e3o.\n\nMeanwhile, in [[Lisbon]], left-wing journalist/lecturer Antonia is having a row with her estranged husband Manuel, a [[Portuguese Army]] captain, over atrocities he has been involved with during the Colonial War. Rosa having arrived to babysit, Antonia then goes to a formal reception where she pleads with her brother (Filipe Correia), a minister in the government, to release one of her students who had been arrested by the [[PIDE#DGS|DGS (secret police)]]. Filipe refuses to help and returns to his conversation with General Pais. The head of the DGS (Salieri) is also present at the reception; he recognises Antonia and subsequently assaults her in a toilet. Ant\u00f3nia returns home in despair, not realising that her estranged husband Manuel is also a coup plotter. Manuel and his colleague prepare to seize control of the R\u00e1dio Clube Portugu\u00eas, a radio station, from which communiques on behalf of the [[Armed Forces Movement]] will be broadcast.\n\nMeanwhile, simultaneously, Maia and his troops are preparing to set off for Lisbon, and the other coup plotters are also preparing to move into position. The signal for the coup to start is the playing of [[Grandola, Vila Morena]] on the radio shortly after midnight on 25 April. Maia's troops set off in a column of armoured vehicles. Manuel, Fonseca, Botelho and Silva capture the R\u00e1dio Clube Portugu\u00eas in Lisbon. A signal is given by morse code by car headlights to prisoners being held in prison by the DGS. Maia's armoured column has to stop in open countryside due to a breakdown by one of the key armoured vehicles; at this point Major Gervasio arrives in a conspicuous red sports car and joins the rebels. Maia's troops arrive in the [[Pra\u00e7a do Com\u00e9rcio]] in Lisbon, but are threatened by a naval warship and by a column of tanks commanded by General Pais (who remains loyal to the regime). Following a stand-off, with Lab\u00e3o and Maia both threatened with being shot, many of Pais' troops defect to the rebels. On entering the Government offices in the Praca do Comercio, Maia discovers that the ministers have fled to the [[Republican National Guard (Portugal)|GNR]] headquarters at [[Carmo Convent (Lisbon)|Carmo]] in Lisbon. There are several asides, including where the young conscript soldier in the opening scenes of the film meets Rosa again, placing a carnation in the barrel of his rifle (and are later discovered inside a military armoured car whilst making love).\n\nAt the GNR barracks, a further stand-off ensues, with the regime leaders (including [[Marcelo Caetano]]) trapped inside. Also trapped in their nearby headquarters, a group of DGS officers open fire from the windows at the crowd in the street outside, killing four - the only fatalities of the Carnation Revolution. Virgilio is one of the casualties. Maia eventually ordering his troops to shoot at the building with machine-gun fire. Following this atrocity, Maia threatens to blow up the building with artillery.\n\nShortly before Maia's deadline expires, emissaries from General [[Ant\u00f3nio de Sp\u00ednola]] arrive, to negotiate the surrender of the regime's leaders. Spinola himself arrives, places Gerv\u00e1sio in local command (despite having spent almost the entire day avoiding any action) and orders Maia to convey the arrested Caetano, Correira and the other leaders to an air force base, from whence they are flown to [[Madeira]] and then on to exile in Brazil. The film closes with the release of the political prisoners, including Antonia's lover (Emilio), and Manuel and Maia narrowly avoid being attacked by a crowd when they are mistaken for DGS/PIDE officers rather than soldiers.\n\nIt is then revealed that Ant\u00f2nia and Emilio will both go into politics, she on the left but he ultimately on the centre-right; after two years together they separate. Manuel will drift into alcoholism and Maia was to die from cancer in his late 40s.

This kind of farming operates with a much greater degree of involvement of consumers and other stakeholders than usual \u2014 resulting in a stronger consumer-producer relationship.<ref name=\"csa21\">{{cite book|author=Committee on Twenty-First Century Systems Agriculture, Board on Agriculture and Natural Resources, Division on Earth and Life Sciences |title=Toward Sustainable Agricultural Systems in the 21st Century|year=2010|publisher=National Academies Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=9780309148962|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wdm4qMW1azgC&lpg=PT227&dq=CSA%20consumer%20farmer%20relationship&pg=PT227#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> The core design includes developing a cohesive consumer group that is willing to fund a whole season's budget in order to get quality foods. The system has many variations on how the farm budget is supported by the consumers and how the producers then deliver the foods. CSA theory purports that the more a farm embraces whole-farm, whole-budget support, the more it can focus on quality and reduce the risk of food waste.\n\n===Structure===\nCommunity-supported agriculture farms in the United States today share three common characteristics: an emphasis on community and/or local produce, share or subscriptions sold prior to season, and weekly deliveries to members/subscribers. Though CSA operation varies from farm to farm and has evolved over time, these three characteristics have remained constant.<ref name=\"2009survey\">[http://api.ning.com/files/3FyohVhrK-m5eIn2G2jfkF2vpDUXaYlfQtSpRUvy4u2WE1tMaovZ673Tnfo*fd8T3ysBa9ncJb4Z81pTNEIQUaoTvYJIe6Qs/NESAWGCSA2001.pdf 2009 Survey of Community Supported Agriculture Producers], University of Kentucky, accessed 05-15-2013.</ref> The functioning of a CSA also relies on four practical arrangements: for farmers to know the needs of a community, for consumers to have the opportunity to express to farmers what their needs and financial limitations are, for commitments between farmers and consumers to be consciously established, and for farmers needs to be recognized.<ref name=\"Lamb\">[http://www.thecenterforsocialresearch.org/sites/default/files/assests/csr/about/csa.pdf \"Community Supported Agriculture\"]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, The Center for Social Research. Accessed 05-15-2013.</ref>\n\nFrom this base, four main types of CSAs have been developed:\n\n* Farmer managed: A farmer sets up and maintains a CSA, recruits subscribers, and controls management of the CSA.\n* Shareholder/subscriber: Local residents set up a CSA and hire a farmer to grow crops, and shareholders/subscribers control most management.\n* Farmer cooperative: Multiple farmers develop a CSA program.\n* Farmer-shareholder cooperative: Farmers and local residents set up and cooperatively manage a CSA.<ref name=\"CSA\">[http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/rbs/CDP-TN20.PDF \"Community Supported Agriculture\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823234251/http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/rbs/CDP-TN20.PDF |date=2012-08-23 }}, Technotes: Office of Community Development, US Department of Agriculture, accessed 05-15-2013.</ref>\n\nIn most original CSAs, a core group of members existed.  This core group of members helped to make decisions about and run the CSA including marketing, distribution, administrative, and community organization functions.  CSAs with a core group of members are most profitable and successful.  However, in 1999, 72 percent of CSAs did not have a core group of members.  CSAs with a core group of members operate more successfully as a farmer-shareholder cooperative and CSAs without a group of core members rely much more on subscriptions and run most prominently as shareholder/subscriber CSAs.<ref name=\"survey1999\">[http://www.cias.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/csaacross.pdf] \"CSA Across the Nation\" Center for Integrated Agricultural Services. Accessed 05-22-2013</ref>\n\n===Ideology===\n\nCommunity-supported agriculture in America was influenced by the ideas of [[Rudolf Steiner]], an Austrian philosopher. He developed the concepts of [[anthroposophy]] and [[biodynamic agriculture]]. The Temple-Wilton Community Farm used his ideas to develop three main goals of CSAs:\n\n* New forms of property ownership: the idea that land should be held in common by a community through a legal trust, which leases the land to farmers\n* New forms of cooperation: the idea that a network of human relationships should replace the traditional system of employers and employees\n* New forms of economy: that the economy should not be based on increasing profit, but should be based on the actual needs of the people and land involved in an enterprise<ref name=\"McFadden\" />\n\nAs CSAs have increased in both number and size since they were first developed, they have also changed ideologically.  While original CSAs and some more current CSAs are still philosophically oriented, most CSAs today are commercially oriented and community-supported agriculture is predominantly seen as a beneficial marketing strategy.<ref name=\"McFadden\" /> This has led to three ideologically based types of CSAs.  The first type is instrumental, the CSA is considered a market in the traditional sense, instead of an alternative form of economy and relationship. The second type is functional; there is a relationship of solidarity between the farmer and the subscribers, but this extends mostly to social functions, not managerial or administrative functions. This is the most common type of CSA.  The final type is collaborative; this is the closest to the original aims of CSAs where the relationship between the farmer and the subscribers is seen as a partnership.<ref name=\"Devon\">[https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10460-008-9154-9.pdf \"Devon Acres CSA: local struggles in a global food system\"] (2008), retrieved 04-11-2013.</ref>\n\n===Distribution and marketing methods===\n\nShares of a CSA originally and predominantly consist of produce. In more recent years, shares have diversified and include non-produce products including eggs, meat, flowers, honey, dairy and soaps.<ref name=\"2009survey\" />  Share prices vary from CSA to CSA.  Shares are sold as full shares, which feed 2 to 5 people, and half shares, which feed 1 to 3 people.  Prices range from $200 to $500 per season.  Full shares are sold at a median of $400 and half shares are sold at a median of $250.<ref name=\"2001summary\">[http://www.cias.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/csa_survey_01.pdf]\"Community Supported Agriculture Entering the 21st Century\". Accessed 23 May 2013.</ref>  Share prices are mostly determined by overhead costs of production, but are also determined by share prices of other CSAs, variable costs of production, market forces, and income level of the community.<ref name=\"2009survey\" /> Many CSAs have payment plans and low-income options.\n\nShares are distributed in several different ways.  Shares are most often distributed weekly. Most CSAs allow share pick up at the farm.  Shares are also distributed through regional dropoff, direct home or office dropoff, farmers' markets, and community center/church dropoff.<ref name=\"2009survey\" /> For example, the new \"Farmie Markets\" of upstate New York<ref name=\"farmies\">{{cite web | url=http://hudsonvalley.farmiemarket.com/ | title=Farmie Markets of Upstate NY | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131110210351/http://hudsonvalley.farmiemarket.com/ | archivedate=2013-11-10 }}</ref> take orders online and have a number of farmers who send that week's orders to a central point in a limited region, for distribution by the organizers.\n\nCSAs market their farms and shares in different ways.  CSAs employ different channels of marketing to diversify their sales efforts and increase subscriptions.  CSAs use local farmers' markets, restaurants, on-farm retail, wholesale to natural food stores, and wholesale to local groceries in addition to their CSAs to market shares. One problem that CSAs encounter is over-production, so CSAs often sell their produce and products in ways other than shares. Often, CSA farms also sell their products at local farmers' markets. Excess products are sometimes given to food banks.<ref name=\"2009survey\" />\n\n=== Challenges for farmers ===\nMany CSA farmers can capitalize on a closer relationship between customers and their food, since some customers will pay more if they know where it is coming from, who is involved, and have special access to it; for more information, see [[economic rent]].<ref name=\"Galt 341\u2013365\"/> However, some farmers participating in community-supported agriculture do not experience the economic benefits that they are perceived to obtain by participating in an alternative community-based arrangement. Galt's 2013 study of CSA farmers found that many farmers exploited themselves, charging lower fees and prices for their goods than would provide them with financial security.<ref name=\"Galt 341\u2013365\"/> This study suggested that farmers may charge less than they need to earn fair wages due to undervaluing their expenses and to offset the high costs of CSA products and make it more affordable for customers; see [[moral economy]].<ref name=\"Galt 341\u2013365\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Agrarian socialism]]\n* [[Agroecology]]\n* [[Artisanal food]]\n* [[Civic agriculture]]\n* [[Common land]]\n* [[Communalism]]\n* [[Community land trust]]\n* [[Community supported fishery]]\n* [[Community wealth building]]\n* [[Development-supported agriculture]]\n* [[Economic rent]]\n* [[Farmers' market]]\n* [[Local food]]\n* [[Moral economy]]\n* [[Sustainable agriculture]]\n* [[Vegetable box scheme]]\n* [[Worker cooperative]]\n* [[WWOOF]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [http://www.rainmagazine.com/archive/1992/community-supported-agriculture01242014 Bryant, Greg.

The system has many variations on how the farm budget is supported by the consumers and how the producers then deliver the foods. CSA theory purports that the more a farm embraces whole-farm, whole-budget support, the more it can focus on quality and reduce the risk of food waste.\n\n===Structure===\nCommunity-supported agriculture farms in the United States today share three common characteristics: an emphasis on community and/or local produce, share or subscriptions sold prior to season, and weekly deliveries to members/subscribers. Though CSA operation varies from farm to farm and has evolved over time, these three characteristics have remained constant.<ref name=\"2009survey\">[http://api.ning.com/files/3FyohVhrK-m5eIn2G2jfkF2vpDUXaYlfQtSpRUvy4u2WE1tMaovZ673Tnfo*fd8T3ysBa9ncJb4Z81pTNEIQUaoTvYJIe6Qs/NESAWGCSA2001.pdf 2009 Survey of Community Supported Agriculture Producers], University of Kentucky, accessed 05-15-2013.</ref> The functioning of a CSA also relies on four practical arrangements: for farmers to know the needs of a community, for consumers to have the opportunity to express to farmers what their needs and financial limitations are, for commitments between farmers and consumers to be consciously established, and for farmers needs to be recognized.<ref name=\"Lamb\">[http://www.thecenterforsocialresearch.org/sites/default/files/assests/csr/about/csa.pdf \"Community Supported Agriculture\"]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, The Center for Social Research. Accessed 05-15-2013.</ref>\n\nFrom this base, four main types of CSAs have been developed:\n\n* Farmer managed: A farmer sets up and maintains a CSA, recruits subscribers, and controls management of the CSA.\n* Shareholder/subscriber: Local residents set up a CSA and hire a farmer to grow crops, and shareholders/subscribers control most management.\n* Farmer cooperative: Multiple farmers develop a CSA program.\n* Farmer-shareholder cooperative: Farmers and local residents set up and cooperatively manage a CSA.<ref name=\"CSA\">[http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/rbs/CDP-TN20.PDF \"Community Supported Agriculture\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823234251/http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/rbs/CDP-TN20.PDF |date=2012-08-23 }}, Technotes: Office of Community Development, US Department of Agriculture, accessed 05-15-2013.</ref>\n\nIn most original CSAs, a core group of members existed.  This core group of members helped to make decisions about and run the CSA including marketing, distribution, administrative, and community organization functions.  CSAs with a core group of members are most profitable and successful.  However, in 1999, 72 percent of CSAs did not have a core group of members.  CSAs with a core group of members operate more successfully as a farmer-shareholder cooperative and CSAs without a group of core members rely much more on subscriptions and run most prominently as shareholder/subscriber CSAs.<ref name=\"survey1999\">[http://www.cias.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/csaacross.pdf] \"CSA Across the Nation\" Center for Integrated Agricultural Services. Accessed 05-22-2013</ref>\n\n===Ideology===\n\nCommunity-supported agriculture in America was influenced by the ideas of [[Rudolf Steiner]], an Austrian philosopher. He developed the concepts of [[anthroposophy]] and [[biodynamic agriculture]]. The Temple-Wilton Community Farm used his ideas to develop three main goals of CSAs:\n\n* New forms of property ownership: the idea that land should be held in common by a community through a legal trust, which leases the land to farmers\n* New forms of cooperation: the idea that a network of human relationships should replace the traditional system of employers and employees\n* New forms of economy: that the economy should not be based on increasing profit, but should be based on the actual needs of the people and land involved in an enterprise<ref name=\"McFadden\" />\n\nAs CSAs have increased in both number and size since they were first developed, they have also changed ideologically.  While original CSAs and some more current CSAs are still philosophically oriented, most CSAs today are commercially oriented and community-supported agriculture is predominantly seen as a beneficial marketing strategy.<ref name=\"McFadden\" /> This has led to three ideologically based types of CSAs.  The first type is instrumental, the CSA is considered a market in the traditional sense, instead of an alternative form of economy and relationship. The second type is functional; there is a relationship of solidarity between the farmer and the subscribers, but this extends mostly to social functions, not managerial or administrative functions. This is the most common type of CSA.  The final type is collaborative; this is the closest to the original aims of CSAs where the relationship between the farmer and the subscribers is seen as a partnership.<ref name=\"Devon\">[https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10460-008-9154-9.pdf \"Devon Acres CSA: local struggles in a global food system\"] (2008), retrieved 04-11-2013.</ref>\n\n===Distribution and marketing methods===\n\nShares of a CSA originally and predominantly consist of produce. In more recent years, shares have diversified and include non-produce products including eggs, meat, flowers, honey, dairy and soaps.<ref name=\"2009survey\" />  Share prices vary from CSA to CSA.  Shares are sold as full shares, which feed 2 to 5 people, and half shares, which feed 1 to 3 people.  Prices range from $200 to $500 per season.  Full shares are sold at a median of $400 and half shares are sold at a median of $250.<ref name=\"2001summary\">[http://www.cias.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/csa_survey_01.pdf]\"Community Supported Agriculture Entering the 21st Century\". Accessed 23 May 2013.</ref>  Share prices are mostly determined by overhead costs of production, but are also determined by share prices of other CSAs, variable costs of production, market forces, and income level of the community.<ref name=\"2009survey\" /> Many CSAs have payment plans and low-income options.\n\nShares are distributed in several different ways.  Shares are most often distributed weekly. Most CSAs allow share pick up at the farm.  Shares are also distributed through regional dropoff, direct home or office dropoff, farmers' markets, and community center/church dropoff.<ref name=\"2009survey\" /> For example, the new \"Farmie Markets\" of upstate New York<ref name=\"farmies\">{{cite web | url=http://hudsonvalley.farmiemarket.com/ | title=Farmie Markets of Upstate NY | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131110210351/http://hudsonvalley.farmiemarket.com/ | archivedate=2013-11-10 }}</ref> take orders online and have a number of farmers who send that week's orders to a central point in a limited region, for distribution by the organizers.\n\nCSAs market their farms and shares in different ways.  CSAs employ different channels of marketing to diversify their sales efforts and increase subscriptions.  CSAs use local farmers' markets, restaurants, on-farm retail, wholesale to natural food stores, and wholesale to local groceries in addition to their CSAs to market shares. One problem that CSAs encounter is over-production, so CSAs often sell their produce and products in ways other than shares. Often, CSA farms also sell their products at local farmers' markets. Excess products are sometimes given to food banks.<ref name=\"2009survey\" />\n\n=== Challenges for farmers ===\nMany CSA farmers can capitalize on a closer relationship between customers and their food, since some customers will pay more if they know where it is coming from, who is involved, and have special access to it; for more information, see [[economic rent]].<ref name=\"Galt 341\u2013365\"/> However, some farmers participating in community-supported agriculture do not experience the economic benefits that they are perceived to obtain by participating in an alternative community-based arrangement. Galt's 2013 study of CSA farmers found that many farmers exploited themselves, charging lower fees and prices for their goods than would provide them with financial security.<ref name=\"Galt 341\u2013365\"/> This study suggested that farmers may charge less than they need to earn fair wages due to undervaluing their expenses and to offset the high costs of CSA products and make it more affordable for customers; see [[moral economy]].<ref name=\"Galt 341\u2013365\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Agrarian socialism]]\n* [[Agroecology]]\n* [[Artisanal food]]\n* [[Civic agriculture]]\n* [[Common land]]\n* [[Communalism]]\n* [[Community land trust]]\n* [[Community supported fishery]]\n* [[Community wealth building]]\n* [[Development-supported agriculture]]\n* [[Economic rent]]\n* [[Farmers' market]]\n* [[Local food]]\n* [[Moral economy]]\n* [[Sustainable agriculture]]\n* [[Vegetable box scheme]]\n* [[Worker cooperative]]\n* [[WWOOF]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [http://www.rainmagazine.com/archive/1992/community-supported-agriculture01242014 Bryant, Greg.

FEED Projects sells FEED bags and a portion of each bag is donated to the United Nations World Food Programme to feed children around the world.\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}\n[[File:Empire Stores lobby.jpg|thumb|FEED store in [[Dumbo, Brooklyn|Brooklyn]].]]\nBush came up with the idea of a FEED bag while in college at [[Princeton University]]. Intended as a fundraiser for the UN World Food Programme, FEED Projects has grown rapidly since its founding. FEED bags have been supported by many different celebrities, including [[Marcia Cross]], [[Ali Larter]], and [[Elizabeth Berkley]]. Gustafson and Bush also co-founded the [[FEED Foundation]], a 501c3 non-profit with the mission of raising awareness and funds to ensure nutritious school meals for all children as a first step toward improving the global food system.\n\n== Products ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}\nThere are a variety of FEED products available for purchase on the FEED website, with new collections launched seasonally, as well as in person, at the FEED Shop & Cafe in DUMBO, Brooklyn. FEED bags are sold in a variety of models, including duffel bags, backpacks, and totes. Every single product provides school meals when purchased, represented by the number stamped on each bag or accessory. The meals are distributed by the brand's giving partners, the UN World Food Programme (global giving) and No Kid Hungry (US giving). One of the very first bags, The FEED 1 bag, provides one child with a year's worth of meals (185 school meals).\n\n==(RED)==\nIn 2012, FEED Projects is listed as a partner of the (RED) campaign, together with other brands such as [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], Girl, [[American Express]] and [[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]].
