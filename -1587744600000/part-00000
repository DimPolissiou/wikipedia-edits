This new arrangement also frees up space in the departure lounges through the removal of the separate duty-free shops in the West and Central Piers. This however meant that the former public viewing areas of the apron are now airside, making the airport inaccessible to aviation enthusiasts and spectators.\n\nFuture growth is hampered by the airport's location, which is constrained by the M8 motorway to the south, the town of Renfrew to the east and the [[River Clyde]] to the north. At present the areas of [[Drumchapel]], [[Clydebank]], [[Bearsden]], [[Foxbar]], [[Faifley]] and [[Linwood, Renfrewshire|Linwood]] all sit directly underneath the approach paths into the airport, meaning that further increases in traffic may be politically sensitive. The airport is challenged by [[Edinburgh Airport]], which now serves a wider range of European destinations and has grown to overtake Glasgow as Scotland's busiest airport.\n\nThe [[Scottish Government|Scottish Executive]] announced in 2002 that a rail line \u2013 known as the [[Glasgow Airport Rail Link]] (GARL) \u2013 would be built from [[Glasgow Central station]] to Glasgow Airport. The rail link was to be completed by 2012 with the first trains running early in 2013.

Eight people were killed and three seriously injured. No one on the ground was hurt. A [[fatal accident inquiry]] into the accident later found that the aircraft developed an engine malfunction during take off. Although the captain decided to return to the airfield, he mistakenly identified the working engine as the faulty one and shut it down, causing the aircraft to crash.\n* On 30 June 2007, a day after the [[2007 London car bombs|failed car bomb attacks in London]], an [[2007 Glasgow Airport attack|attack at Glasgow International Airport]] occurred. A flaming [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)|Jeep Cherokee]] was driven into the entrance of Main Terminal. Two men, one alight, fled the vehicle before being apprehended by a combination of police officers, airport security officers and witnesses. One of the men died in the following months due to injuries sustained in the attack.

In 1933 the [[Royal Air Force]] [[No. 602 Squadron RAF|602 Squadron]] (City of Glasgow) [[Royal Auxiliary Air Force|Auxiliary Air Force]] moved its [[Westland Wapiti|Wapiti IIA]] aircraft from nearby Renfrew.<ref name=\"smith-abbotsinch\">Smith, Abbotsinch</ref> The RAF Station HQ, however, was not formed until 1 July 1936 when 6 Auxiliary Group, [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber Command]], arrived.<ref name=\"smith-abbotsinch\" /> From May 1939, until moving away in October 1939, the Squadron flew the [[Supermarine Spitfire]].\n\n===1940===\nIn 1940, a [[torpedo]] training unit was formed, which trained both RAF and [[Royal Navy]] crews.<ref name=\"smith-abbotsinch\" /> On 11 August 1943 Abbotsinch was handed over solely to the Royal Navy and it became a [[stone frigate|naval base]]. All [[Her Majesty's Ship]]s and naval bases are given ship names and Abbotsinch's was known as HMS Sanderling since June 1940.<ref name=\"smith-abbotsinch\" /> During the 1950s, the airfield housed a large aircraft storage unit and squadrons of the [[Royal Naval Reserve|Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]].\n\nThe Royal Navy left in October 1963.<ref name=\"smith-abbotsinch\" /> The name [[Sanderling]] was, however, retained as a link between the two: HMS Sanderling's [[ship's bell]] was presented to the new airport and a bar in the airport was named ''The Sanderling Bar''.\n\nThe following units were here at some point:<ref name=\"ABCT\">{{cite web|url=http://www.abct.org.uk/airfields/airfield-finder/abbotsinch-glasgow/ |title=Abbotsinch |publisher=[[Airfields of Britain Conservation Trust]]|accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref>\n{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n* No. 2 Coastal Patrol Flight\n* [[No. 4 Air Experience Flight RAF]]\n* [[No. 4 Gliding School RAF]]\n* No. 6 Aircraft Assembly Unit\n* [[No. 21 Squadron RAF]]\n* [[No. 34 Squadron RAF]]\n* [[No. 88 Squadron RAF]]\n* [[No. 225 Squadron RAF]]\n* [[No. 232 Squadron RAF]]\n* [[No. 239 Squadron RAF]]\n* [[No. 254 Squadron RAF]]\n* [[No. 269 Squadron RAF]]\n* [[No. 309 Squadron RAF]]\n* [[No. 414 Squadron RAF]]\n* [[No. 418 Flight RAF]]\n* [[No. 602 Squadron RAF]]\n* [[No. 607 Squadron RAF]]\n* [[No. 610 Squadron RAF]]\n* [[No. 663 Gliding School RAF]]\n* [[No. 666 Squadron RAF]]\n* [[730 Naval Air Squadron]]\n* [[768 Naval Air Squadron]]\n* [[800 Naval Air Squadron]]\n* [[801 Naval Air Squadron]]\n* [[802 Naval Air Squadron]]\n* [[804 Naval Air Squadron]]\n* [[807 Naval Air Squadron]]\n* [[813 Naval Air Squadron]]\n* [[816 Naval Air Squadron]]\n* [[818 Naval Air Squadron]]\n* [[819 Naval Air Squadron]]\n* [[821 Naval Air Squadron]]\n* [[824 Naval Air Squadron]]\n* [[825 Naval Air Squadron]]\n* [[831 Naval Air Squadron]]\n* [[832 Naval Air Squadron]]\n* [[835 Naval Air Squadron]]\n* [[852 Naval Air Squadron]]\n* [[892 Naval Air Squadron]]\n* [[No. 1441 (Combined Operations Development) Flight RAF]]\n* No. 1680 (Western Isles) Communications Flight RAF\n* [[1702 Naval Air Squadron]]\n* [[1830 Naval Air Squadron]]\n* [[1840 Naval Air Squadron]]\n* [[1843 Naval Air Squadron]]\n* [[No. 1967 Reserve AOP Flight RAF]]\n* Torpedo Training Unit\n* [[Universities of Glasgow and Strathclyde Air Squadron]]\n}}\n\n===1960s===\nIn the 1960s, [[Politics of Glasgow|Glasgow Corporation]] decided that a new airport for the city was required.

Spence's original concrete facade which once looked onto Caledonia Road now fronts the [[check-in]] desks. The original building can be seen more clearly from the rear, with the mock barrel-vaulted roof visible when airside.\n\nA dedicated international departure lounge and pier was added at the western side of the building, leaving the facility with a total of 38 [[Gate (airport)|gates]], bringing its capacity up to nine million passengers per year.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} In 2003, BAA completed redevelopment work on a satellite building (called \"T2\", formerly the St. Andrews Building), to provide a dedicated check-in facility for low-cost airlines, principally Aer Lingus, Virgin Atlantic Airways and formerly [[Thomas Cook Airlines]] until they went into administration.\n\nBy 1996, Glasgow was handling over 5.5&nbsp;million passengers per annum, making it the fourth-largest airport in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/80/airport_data/1996Annual/Table_09_Terminal_and_Transit_Pax_1996.pdf |title=Terminal & Transit Passengers at UK Airports \u2013 1996 |publisher=[[Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)|UK Civil Aviation Authority]] |year=1996 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606114851/http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/80/airport_data/1996Annual/Table_09_Terminal_and_Transit_Pax_1996.pdf |archivedate=6 June 2011  }}</ref>\n\n===Today===\n[[File:16-11-16-Glasgow Airport-RR2 7310.jpg|thumb|right|215px|Terminal 2 building, situated next to the main terminal building]]\n[[File:Glasgowairport3.jpg|thumb|Tail fins at the international pier]]\n[[File:Glasgow Airport DSC 0856 (13765675113).jpg|thumb|right|215px|Glasgow Airport main terminal building]]\nThe airport serves a variety of destinations throughout Europe, North America and the Middle East.

This new arrangement also frees up space in the departure lounges through the removal of the separate duty-free shops in the West and Central Piers. This however meant that the former public viewing areas of the apron are now airside, making the airport inaccessible to aviation enthusiasts and spectators.\n\nFuture growth is hampered by the airport's location, which is constrained by the M8 motorway to the south, the town of Renfrew to the east and the [[River Clyde]] to the north. At present the areas of [[Drumchapel]], [[Clydebank]], [[Bearsden]], [[Foxbar]], [[Faifley]] and [[Linwood, Renfrewshire|Linwood]] all sit directly underneath the approach paths into the airport, meaning that further increases in traffic may be politically sensitive. The airport is challenged by [[Edinburgh Airport]], which now serves a wider range of European destinations and has grown to overtake Glasgow as Scotland's busiest airport.\n\nThe [[Scottish Government|Scottish Executive]] announced in 2002 that a rail line \u2013 known as the [[Glasgow Airport Rail Link]] (GARL) \u2013 would be built from [[Glasgow Central station]] to Glasgow Airport. The rail link was to be completed by 2012 with the first trains running early in 2013. In 2009, however, it was announced by the Scottish Government that the plan had been cancelled.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/8256474.stm | title = Ministers scrap airport rail plan | work = [[BBC News]] | date = 17 September 2009 | access-date = 17 September 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170728210311/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/8256474.stm | archive-date = 28 July 2017 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nCurrently, the airport is easily accessible by road due with direct access to the adjoining M8 motorway. It is also served by a frequent bus service, the Glasgow Airport Express, which operates services to [[Glasgow city centre|city centre]].

Eight people were killed and three seriously injured. No one on the ground was hurt. A [[fatal accident inquiry]] into the accident later found that the aircraft developed an engine malfunction during take off. Although the captain decided to return to the airfield, he mistakenly identified the working engine as the faulty one and shut it down, causing the aircraft to crash.\n* On 30 June 2007, a day after the [[2007 London car bombs|failed car bomb attacks in London]], an [[2007 Glasgow Airport attack|attack at Glasgow International Airport]] occurred. A flaming [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)|Jeep Cherokee]] was driven into the entrance of Main Terminal. Two men, one alight, fled the vehicle before being apprehended by a combination of police officers, airport security officers and witnesses. One of the men died in the following months due to injuries sustained in the attack. New barriers and security measures have been added to prevent a similar incident from taking place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uk-airport-news.info/glasgow-airport-news-221107.htm|title=UK-Airport-News - Airport Transportation|website=www.uk-airport-news.info|access-date=3 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121033949/http://www.uk-airport-news.info/glasgow-airport-news-221107.htm|archive-date=21 November 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Ground transport==\n[[File:First Glasgow airport bus 2019.jpg|thumb|right|Airport express buses are painted in a distinctive livery.]]\nThe airport is currently linked to Glasgow City Centre by Glasgow Shuttle bus service 500.

The prison is operated by [[Her Majesty's Prison Service]].\n\n==History==\nHollesley Bay began in 1887 as a colonial college training those intending to emigrate.  The prison had housed a labour colony for the London unemployed. The land was originally purchased by [[Joseph Fels]], an American soap-manufacturing millionaire and friend of [[George Lansbury]], the prominent Christian Socialist who was also a leading member of the Poplar Board of Guardians. In 1905 Fels transferred the land to the London Unemployed Fund, who in turn handed it over to the Central Unemployed Body for London. Subsequently it was taken over by [[London County Council]].\n\nThere were a number of similar labour colonies across Britain. Their aim was to train unemployed people for work, with a view to helping them escape pauperism. Hollesley Bay was typical in that it mainly involved exposing its inmates to a period of work either on agricultural tasks or in the kitchens and other relatively unskilled activities. There was a short-lived strike among the inmates in May 1922, partly sparked by dissatisfaction over the inmates' levels of pay. It was said to hold around 280 men in 1923, rising to 366 in the late 1920s, and falling to around 200 in 1934. London County Council decided to dispose of the site in 1938.\n\nIn 1938 the [[Prison Commission (England and Wales)|Prison Commission]] purchased the site for use as a [[Borstal and Detention centre]].

The previous landmark old City Hall of 1899-1906 was two blocks from the present one. It was bounded by Larkin Street, McAllister Street, and City Hall Avenue (a street, now built over, which ran from the corner of Grove and Larkin to the corner of McAllister and Leavenworth), largely where the [[Main Library (San Francisco)|current main/central public library building]] and the [[United Nations Plaza (San Francisco)|United Nations (U.N.) Plaza]] stand today.\n\nThe principal architect was [[Arthur Brown, Jr.]], of the firm Bakewell & Brown, whose attention to the finishing details extended to the doorknobs and the typeface to be used in [[signage]]. Brown's [[blueprint]]s of the building are preserved at the Bancroft Library at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Brown also designed the [[War Memorial Opera House|San Francisco War Memorial Opera House]] located opposite of the City Hall, along with the Veterans Building, Temple Emanuel, [[Coit Tower]] and the Federal office building at [[50 United Nations Plaza]].\n\n__TOC__\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:SFCityHallInteriorStairs.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Interior stairs lead to the Board of Supervisor's meeting chamber]]\nThe building's vast open space is more than {{convert|500000|ft2}} and occupies two full city blocks.

It is faced with Madera County granite on the exterior, and Indiana sandstone within, together with finish marbles from Alabama, Colorado, Vermont, and Italy. Much of the statuary is by [[Henri Crenier]].\n\n[[File:SF City Hall weddings.jpg|thumb|The grand staircase is a popular place for wedding gatherings]]\n\nThe Rotunda is a spectacular space and the upper levels are public and handicapped accessible. Opposite the grand staircase, on the second floor, is the office of the Mayor. Bronze busts of former Mayor [[George Moscone]] and his successor, [[Dianne Feinstein]], stand nearby as tacit reminders of the [[George Moscone#Assassination|Moscone assassination]], which took place just a few yards from that spot in the smaller rotunda of the mayor's office entrance.

Prior to the 1960s there were extensive brick plazas, few trees, and a few large, simple, raised, and circular ponds with central fountains, all in a style that discouraged loitering. The plaza was then extensively excavated for underground parking. At this time a central rectangular pond, with an extensive array of water vents (strangely, all in several strict rows and all pointing east, with identical arcs of water, and completely without sculptural embellishment), was added, with extensive groves of trees (again, in 60s [[modernist]] style, planted with absolute military precision on rectangular grids). In the 1990s, with the rise of the problem of [[homelessness]], the plaza was once again remodeled to make it somewhat less habitable\u2014although the most significant change, the replacement of the pond and pumps with a lawn, could be reasonably justified on the basis of [[energy conservation|energy]] and [[water conservation]].\n\n[[File:SF City Hall Election Day 2018.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|San Francisco City Hall with red, white and blue lights on 2018 [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]]]]\nMartha Cohen, director of Special Events, has added color changeable LED lighting to the outside of the Rotunda, and between the exterior columns.

This event was memorialized by students during the [[Free Speech Movement]] at UC Berkeley four years later.\n\nMayor [[George Moscone]] and Supervisor [[Harvey Milk]] were [[Moscone-Milk assassinations|assassinated]] at City Hall in 1978, by former Supervisor [[Dan White]].\n\nThe [[Loma Prieta earthquake]] of 1989 damaged the structure, and twisted the dome four inches (102&nbsp;mm) on its base. Afterward, under the leadership of the San Francisco Bureau of Architecture in collaboration with Carey & Co. preservation architects, and Forell/Elsesser Engineers, work was completed to render the building earthquake resistant through a [[base isolation]] system,<ref group=notes>In an earthquake, the mass of the dome threatens to act as a pendulum, rocking the building's structure and tearing it apart, but the base isolation system of hundreds of rubber and stainless-steel insulators inserted into City Hall's underpinnings should have the effect of disrupting [[seismic wave]]s before they can affect the structure.</ref> which would likely prevent total collapse of the building.

Prior to the 1960s there were extensive brick plazas, few trees, and a few large, simple, raised, and circular ponds with central fountains, all in a style that discouraged loitering. The plaza was then extensively excavated for underground parking. At this time a central rectangular pond, with an extensive array of water vents (strangely, all in several strict rows and all pointing east, with identical arcs of water, and completely without sculptural embellishment), was added, with extensive groves of trees (again, in 60s [[modernist]] style, planted with absolute military precision on rectangular grids). In the 1990s, with the rise of the problem of [[homelessness]], the plaza was once again remodeled to make it somewhat less habitable\u2014although the most significant change, the replacement of the pond and pumps with a lawn, could be reasonably justified on the basis of [[energy conservation|energy]] and [[water conservation]].\n\n[[File:SF City Hall Election Day 2018.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|San Francisco City Hall with red, white and blue lights on 2018 [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]]]]\nMartha Cohen, director of Special Events, has added color changeable LED lighting to the outside of the Rotunda, and between the exterior columns. The colors change to coincide with different events happening in the city and elsewhere.\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe beauty of City Hall has not been lost on filmmakers working in San Francisco; many films have shot scenes in and around the building. Ironically, what may be the best-known scene was set in Washington, DC but filmed at San Francisco City Hall: in ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' a late addition to the production was filmed in the rotunda when it was decided that a [[epilogue|coda]] was needed for Indiana Jones and Marion Ravenwood's relationship.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t7KMUcXNVZ8C&pg=PA82&lpg=PA82 |title=World Film Locations: San Francisco |editor=Harris, Scott Jordan |date=2013 |publisher=Intellect Books, The University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago, Illinois |isbn=978-1-78320-028-3 |pages=82\u201383 |accessdate=29 October 2018}}</ref> The City Hall was also prominently featured throughout and famously at the end of ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978 film)|Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]''.<ref name=poop /> ''[[Dirty Harry]]'' filmed a key scene in the Mayor's office itself.<ref name=poop>{{cite web |url=https://blog.sfgate.com/parenting/2010/11/22/six-best-uses-of-san-francisco-city-hall-in-the-movies/ |title=Six best uses of San Francisco City Hall in the movies |author=Hartlaub, Peter |date=November 22, 2010 |website=The Poop [blog] |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=29 October 2018}}</ref> In the opening sequence of ''[[The Towering Inferno]]'', the film's dedication is superimposed over a shot of City Hall, and the helicopter taking [[Paul Newman]] to the Glass Tower is shown flying over the building.\n\nOther films that feature City Hall include:\n* ''[[Foul Play (1978 film)|Foul Play]]'' (1978)<ref name=poop />\n* ''[[A View to a Kill]]'' (1985)<ref name=kill />\n* ''[[Milk (film)|Milk]]'' (2008)<ref name=poop /><ref>{{cite journal | last=Kit | first=Borys | title='Milk' shoot does the Castro good | journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=February 1, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe scene from ''A View to a Kill'' (the last [[James Bond]] film to star [[Roger Moore]]) is particularly memorable for the blaze which tore through the building as a result of an attempt to kill Bond and [[Stacey Sutton]], however they managed to escape, stealing a fire truck in the process.<ref name=kill>{{cite web |  title=San Francisco City Hall - San Francisco, CA, USA - James Bond - 007 | url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM5HBN_San_Francisco_City_Hall_San_Francisco_CA_USA | publisher=Waymarking.com | date=8 January 2009 | accessdate=2010-03-08}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{stack|{{Portal|San Francisco Bay Area}}}}\n* [[List of San Francisco Designated Landmarks]]\n* [[List of tallest buildings in San Francisco]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=notes}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|San Francisco City Hall}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120408200000/http://www.sfgov.org/index.asp San Francisco City Hall] \u2013 official site\n** [http://sfcityhallevents.org/virtual-tour Virtual tour on the official site]\n* [https://sfch.budryerson.com Virtual Tour of City Hall and Dome] An unofficial guide to items of historic, artistic and architectural interest.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131212172130/http://360panos.com/local/SFCityHall.php 360 degree panoramic photographs of San Francisco's City Hall], from [http://360panos.com Don Bain's 360\u00b0 Panoramas]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090820125630/http://www.sfgov.org/site/cityhall_page.asp?id=5790 San Francisco government] City hall restoration project\n* [http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/hhh.ca0633 Historic American Buildings Survey (Library of Congress): City Hall, Civic Center, San Francisco, San Francisco County, CA]\n* [http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/tf6p3009q4/ Images of City Hall and Civic Center, 1912-1918] and [http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/tf38700828/ The New City Hall, 1915], [[The Bancroft Library]]\n* [http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/details?mid=dcb2e3410f0cb0e829f35152e54be69e 3D model] (Google sketchup/earth)\n\n{{Civic Center, San Francisco}}\n{{Buildings in San Francisco}}\n{{San Francisco Attractions}}\n{{Neighborhoods of San_Francisco}}\n{{Authority Control}}\n[[Category:Arthur Brown Jr. buildings]]\n[[Category:Beaux-Arts architecture in California]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures burned in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake]]\n[[Category:City halls in California]]\n[[Category:Civic Center, San Francisco|.City Hall]]\n[[Category:Government buildings completed in 1915]]\n[[Category:Government buildings with domes]]\n[[Category:Rebuilt buildings and structures in the United States]]\n[[Category:San Francisco Designated Landmarks|San Francisco City Hall]]\n[[Category:Skyscrapers in San Francisco|City Hall]]\n[[Category:Terminating vistas in the United States]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in San Francisco|City Hall]]\n", "name_user": "Hmains", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(new key forCategory:San Francisco Designated Landmarks: \"San Francisco City Hall\" usingHotCat)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_City_Hall"}
