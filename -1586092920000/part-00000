{"title_page": "History of Germany", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}\n{{Redirect|German History|the academic journal|German History (journal)}}\n{{short description|Occurrences and people in Germany throughout history}}\n{{History of Germany}}\nThe concept of [[Germany]] as a distinct region in central Europe can be traced to Roman commander [[Julius Caesar]], who referred to the unconquered area east of the [[Rhine]] as ''[[Germania]]'', thus distinguishing it from [[Gaul]] (France), which he had conquered. The victory of the [[Cherusci|Germanic tribes]] in the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] ([[AD]] 9) prevented annexation by the [[Roman Empire]], although the [[Roman provinces]] of [[Germania Superior]] and [[Germania Inferior]] were established along the [[Rhine]]. Following the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire]], the [[Franks]] conquered the other [[West Germanic languages|West]] [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]]. When the [[Francia|Frankish Empire]] was divided among [[Charles the Great]]'s heirs in 843, the eastern part became [[East Francia]]. In 962, [[Otto I]] became the first [[Holy Roman Emperor]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the medieval German state.\n\nIn the [[Late Middle Ages]], the regional dukes, princes, and bishops gained power at the expense of the emperors. [[Martin Luther]] led the [[Protestant Reformation]] against the Catholic Church after 1517, as the northern states became Protestant, while the southern states remained Catholic. The two parts of the Holy Roman Empire clashed in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648), which was ruinous to the twenty million civilians living in both parts. The Thirty Years' War brought tremendous destruction to Germany; more than 1/4 of the population and 1/2 of the male population in the German states were killed by the catastrophic war. 1648 marked the effective end of the Holy Roman Empire and the beginning of the modern nation-state system, with Germany divided into numerous independent states, such as [[Prussia]], [[Bavaria]], [[Saxony]], [[Austria]] and other states, which also controlled land outside of the area considered \"Germany\".\n\nAfter the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] from 1803\u20131815, feudalism fell away and liberalism and nationalism clashed with reaction. The German revolutions of 1848\u201349 failed. The [[Industrial Revolution]] modernized the German economy, led to the rapid growth of cities and the emergence of the [[History of socialism|socialist movement]] in Germany. Prussia, with its capital [[Berlin]], grew in power. German universities became world-class centers for science and humanities, while music and art flourished. The [[unification of Germany]] (excluding Austria and the German-speaking areas of Switzerland) was achieved under the leadership of the Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] with the formation of the [[German Empire]] in 1871.  This resulted in the ''[[German question|Kleindeutsche L\u00f6sung]]'', (\"small Germany solution\", Germany without Austria), rather than the ''Gro\u00dfdeutsche L\u00f6sung'', (\"greater Germany solution\", Germany with Austria). The new ''[[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]]'', an elected parliament, had only a limited role in the imperial government. Germany joined the other powers in [[German colonial empire|colonial expansion in Africa and the Pacific]].\n\nBy 1900, Germany was the dominant power on the European continent and its rapidly expanding industry had surpassed Britain's while provoking it in [[Anglo-German naval arms race|a naval arms race]]. Germany led the [[Central Powers]] in [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918) against France, Great Britain, Russia and (by 1917) the United States. Defeated and partly occupied, Germany was forced to pay [[war reparations]] by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and was stripped of its colonies as well as of home territory to be ceded to Belgium, France, and Poland, and was banned from uniting with [[Republic of German-Austria|German-settled regions of Austria]]. The [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319]] put an end to the [[Federal monarchy|federal]] [[constitutional monarchy]], which resulted in the establishment of the [[Weimar Republic]], an unstable parliamentary democracy.\n\nIn the early 1930s, the worldwide [[Great Depression]] hit Germany hard, as unemployment soared and people lost confidence in the government. In January 1933, [[Adolf Hitler]] was appointed [[Chancellor of Germany]]. His [[Nazi Party]] quickly established a [[totalitarian]] regime, and [[Nazi Germany]] made increasingly aggressive territorial demands, threatening war if they were not met. [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland]] came in 1936, then annexation of Austria in the ''[[Anschluss]]'' and German-speaking regions of Czechoslovakia with the [[Munich Agreement]] in 1938, and [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|further territory of Czechoslovakia]] in 1939. On 1 September 1939, Germany initiated [[World War II]] in Europe with the [[invasion of Poland]]. After forming a [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|pact with the Soviet Union]] in 1939, Hitler and Stalin divided Eastern Europe. After a \"[[Phoney War]]\" in spring 1940, the Germans swept Denmark and Norway, the Low Countries, and France, giving Germany control of nearly all of Western Europe. Hitler [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]] in June 1941.\n\nRacism, especially [[antisemitism]], was a central feature of the Nazi regime. In Germany, but predominantly in the [[German-occupied Europe|German-occupied areas]], the systematic [[genocide]] program known as [[the Holocaust]] killed 11 million, including Jews, German dissidents, disabled people, Poles, Romanies, Soviets (Russian and non-Russian), and others. In 1942, the German invasion of the Soviet Union faltered, and after the [[Military history of the United States during World War II|United States entered the war]], Britain became the base for massive [[Strategic bombing during World War II|Anglo-American bombings]] of German cities.  Following the Allied [[invasion of Normandy]] (June 1944), the German Army was pushed back on all fronts until the final collapse in May 1945.\n\nUnder [[Allied-occupied Germany|occupation by the Allies]], German territories were split up, Austria was again made a separate country, [[denazification]] took place, and the [[Cold War]] resulted in the division of the country into democratic [[Germany|West Germany]] and communist [[East Germany]], reduced in territory by the establishment of the [[Oder-Neisse line]]. Millions of ethnic Germans were deported from [[Former eastern territories of Germany|pre-war Eastern Germany]], [[Sudetenland]], and from [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944\u20131950)|all over Eastern Europe]], in what is described as the largest scale of ethnic cleansing in history.<ref> {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=D3IDT1RmI38C&printsec=frontcover&dq=gregor+thum+uprooted#v=snippet&q=ethnic%20cleansing&f=false|title=Uprooted: How Breslau Became Wroclaw during the Century of Expulsions|first=Gregor|last= Thum|page=55| year=2011|isbn=978-1-40083-996-4|publisher=Princeton University Press}}</ref>. Germans also fled from Communist areas into West Germany, which experienced rapid [[Wirtschaftswunder|economic expansion]], and became the dominant economy in Western Europe. West Germany was rearmed in the 1950s under the auspices of [[NATO]] but without access to nuclear weapons. The [[France\u2013Germany relations|Franco-German friendship]] became the basis for the political integration of Western Europe in the [[European Union]]. In 1989, the [[Berlin Wall]] was destroyed, the [[Soviet Union]] collapsed, and East Germany was [[Reunification of Germany|reunited with West Germany]] in 1990. In 1998\u20131999, Germany was one of the founding countries of the [[eurozone]]. Germany remains one of the economic powerhouses of Europe, contributing about one-quarter of the eurozone's annual [[gross domestic product]]. In the early 2010s, Germany played a critical role in trying to resolve the escalating euro crisis, especially concerning Greece and other [[Southern European]] nations. In the middle of the decade, the country faced the [[European migrant crisis]] as the main receiver of asylum seekers from [[Syria]] and other troubled regions.\n\n''For more events, see [[Timeline of German history]].''\n\n==Prehistory==\n{{Main|Prehistory of Germany}}\n[[Image:Homo steinheimensis, holotype.jpg|thumb|160px|The 250,000-year-old [[Steinheim skull]]]]\nThe discovery of the [[Mauer 1|Homo heidelbergensis]] mandible in 1907 affirms archaic human presence in Germany by at least 600,000 years ago.{{sfn|Wagner|2010|pp=19726\u201319730}} The oldest complete set of hunting weapons ever found anywhere in the world was excavated from a coal mine in [[Sch\u00f6ningen]], [[Lower Saxony]].

A series of forts and commercial centers were established along the two rivers. Some tribes, such as the [[Ubii]] consequently allied with Rome and readily adopted advanced Roman culture. During the 1st century CE Roman legions conducted extended campaigns into [[Germania|Germania magna]], the area north of the Upper Danube and east of the Rhine, attempting to subdue the various tribes. Roman ideas of administration, the imposition of taxes and a legal framework were frustrated by the total absence of an infrastructure. The campaigns of [[Germanicus]], for example were almost exclusively characterized by frequent massacres of villagers and indiscriminate pillaging. The tribes, however maintained their elusive identities. In 9 AD a coalition of tribes under the [[Cherusci]] chieftain [[Arminius]], who was familiar with Roman tactical doctrines, defeated a sizeable Roman force in the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]]. Consequently, Rome resolved to permanently establish the Rhine/Danube border and refrain from further territorial advance into Germania.{{sfn|Smithsonian (September 2005)}}{{sfn|Ozment|2005|pp=2\u201321}} By AD 100 the frontier along the Rhine and the Danube and the [[Limes Germanicus]] was firmly established.

Although occasionally assisted by war-experienced noblemen like [[G\u00f6tz von Berlichingen]] and [[Florian Geyer]] (in Franconia) and the theologian [[Thomas M\u00fcntzer]] (in Thuringia), the peasant forces lacked military structure, skill, logistics and equipment and as many as 100,000 insurgents were eventually defeated and massacred by the territorial princes.<ref>Michael G.

Overall social and economic disruption caused a dramatic decline in population as a result of pandemic murder and random rape and killings, endemic infectious diseases, crop failures, famine, declining birth rates, wanton burglary, witch-hunts and the emigration of terrified people.

[[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]] was in economically good shape, although its government was seriously mismanaged, and numerous wars had taken their toll. During the time when Prussia rose rapidly within Germany, Saxony was distracted by foreign affairs. The house of Wettin concentrated on acquiring and then holding on to the Polish throne which was ultimately unsuccessful. In [[History of W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]] the duke lavished funds on palaces, mistresses, great celebration, and hunting expeditions. Many of the city-states of Germany were run by bishops, who in reality were from powerful noble families and showed scant interest in religion.

In the process, Prussia became too heterogeneous, lost its identity, and by the 1930s had become an administrative shell of little importance.\n\n===Nobility===\nThe nobility represented the [[Estates of the realm|first estate]] in a typical early modern kingdom of Christian Europe, with Germany being no exception. The empire's pluralistic character also applied to its nobility, that greatly varied in power and wealth, ideas, ambition, loyalty and education. However, there existed the distinction between the ''Imperial nobility'', the direct vassals of the emperor and the ''Territorial nobility'', who have received their [[fief]] from the [[Imperial Estate|territorial princes]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.holyromanempireassociation.com/imperial-nobility-of-germany.html  |title=The Imperial Nobility of Germany  |publisher= Holy Roman Empire Association  | accessdate= 14 April 2019 }}</ref> Many of whom had been impoverished as their standard of life and culture had declined since the end of the Medieval period. In an ever more complex economy, they struggled to compete with the patricians and merchants of the cities. The Thirty Years War marked the reversal of fortunes for those noblemen, who seized the initiative and had understood the requirements of higher education for a lucrative position in the post-war territorial administration. In the Prussian lands east of the Elbe river the system of [[Manorialism|manorial jurisdiction]] guaranteed near universal legal power and economic freedom for the local lords, called [[Junker]]s, who dominated not only the localities, but also the Prussian court, and especially the Prussian army. Increasingly after 1815, a centralized Prussian government based in Berlin took over the powers of the nobles, which in terms of control over the peasantry had been almost absolute. To help the nobility avoid indebtedness, Berlin set up a credit institution to provide capital loans in 1809, and extended the loan network to peasants in 1849. When the German Empire was established in 1871, the Junker nobility controlled the army and the Navy, the bureaucracy, and the royal court; they generally set governmental policies.<ref>{{cite book | first=Eda | last=Segarra | title=A Social History of Germany: 1648\u20131914 | year=1977 | pages=37\u201355, 183\u2013202}}</ref>\n\n===Peasants and rural life===\nPeasants continued to center their lives in the village, where they were members of a corporate body, and to help manage the community resources and monitor the community life. In the East, they were serfs who were bound permanently to parcels of land. In most of Germany, farming was handled by tenant farmers who paid rents and obligatory services to the landlord, who was typically a nobleman. Peasant leaders supervised the fields and ditches and grazing rights, maintained public order and morals, and supported a village court which handled minor offenses. Inside the family the patriarch made all the decisions, and tried to arrange advantageous marriages for his children. Much of the villages' communal life centered around church services and holy days. In Prussia, the peasants drew lots to choose conscripts required by the army. The noblemen handled external relationships and politics for the villages under their control, and were not typically involved in daily activities or decisions.<ref name=sagarra>{{cite book | last =Sagarra | first=Eda | title=A Social History of Germany: 1648\u20131914 | year=1977 | pages=140\u2013154, 341\u201345}}</ref><ref>For details on the life of a representative peasant farmer, who migrated in 1710 to Pennsylvania, see Bernd Kratz, \"Jans Stauffer: A Farmer in Germany before his Emigration to Pennsylvania,\" ''Genealogist,'' Fall 2008, Vol. 22 Issue 2, pp 131\u2013169</ref>\n\n[[Image:Adriaen van Ostade - Peasants in a Tavern.jpg|thumb|\"Peasants in a Tavern\" by [[Adriaen van Ostade]] (c. 1635), at the Alte Pinakothek, Munich]]\n\nThe emancipation of the serfs came in 1770\u20131830, beginning with Schleswig in 1780. The peasants were now ex-serfs and could own their land, buy and sell it, and move about freely. The nobles approved for now they could buy land owned by the peasants. The chief reformer was [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein|Baron vom Stein]] (1757\u20131831), who was influenced by [[The Enlightenment]], especially the free market ideas of [[Adam Smith]].<ref>{{cite book | first=Guy Stanton | last=Ford | title=Stein and the era of reform in Prussia, 1807\u20131815 | publisher=Princeton University Press | year=1922 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/steinanderarefo01fordgoog/page/n205 199]\u2013220 | url=https://archive.org/details/steinanderarefo01fordgoog}}</ref> The end of serfdom raised the personal legal status of the peasantry. A bank was set up so that landowners could borrow government money to buy land from peasants (the peasants were not allowed to use it to borrow money to buy land until 1850). The result was that the large landowners obtained larger estates, and many peasants became landless tenants, or moved to the cities or to America. The other German states imitated Prussia after 1815. In sharp contrast to the violence that characterized land reform in the French Revolution, Germany handled it peacefully. In Schleswig the peasants, who had been influenced by the Enlightenment, played an active role; elsewhere they were largely passive. Indeed, for most peasants, customs and traditions continued largely unchanged, including the old habits of deference to the nobles whose legal authority remained quite strong over the villagers. Although the peasants were no longer tied to the same land as serfs had been, the old paternalistic relationship in East Prussia lasted into the 20th century.<ref name=sagarra/>\n\nThe agrarian reforms in northwestern Germany in the era 1770\u20131870 were driven by progressive governments and local elites. They abolished [[feudal obligations]] and divided collectively owned common land into private parcels and thus created a more efficient market-oriented rural economy, which increased productivity and population growth and strengthened the traditional social order because wealthy peasants obtained most of the former common land, while the rural proletariat was left without land; many left for the cities or America. Meanwhile, the division of the common land served as a buffer preserving social peace between nobles and peasants.<ref>{{citation | first=Stefan | last=Brakensiek | title=Agrarian Individualism in North-Western Germany, 1770\u20131870 | newspaper=German History | date=April 1994 | volume=12 | issue=2 | pages=137\u2013179}}</ref> In the east the serfs were emancipated but the [[Junker|Junker class]] maintained its large estates and monopolized political power.<ref>{{citation | first=J.

No longer did the owner's wife take charge of all the females in the different families in the whole house.  In the new system, farm owners became more professionalized and profit-oriented. They managed the fields and the household exterior according to the dictates of technology, science, and economics. Farm wives supervised family care and the household interior, to which strict standards of cleanliness, order, and thrift applied. The result was the spread of formerly urban bourgeois values into rural Germany.<ref>Marion W. Gray and June K.

They had to provide for their own supervision, health, schooling, and old-age. At the same time, because of the demographic transition, there were far fewer children, allowing for much greater attention to each child. Increasingly the middle-class family valued its privacy and its inward direction, shedding too-close links with the world of work.<ref>Nipperdey, ch 2.</ref> Furthermore, the working classes, the middle classes and the upper classes became physically, psychologically and politically more separate.

In order to secure a satisfactory marriage, a woman needed to bring a substantial dowry. In the wealthier families, daughters received their dowry from their families, whereas the poorer women needed to work in order to save their wages so as to improve their chances to wed. Under the German laws, women had property rights over their dowries and inheritances, a valuable benefit as high mortality rates resulted in successive marriages.

The liberal spirit of the [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and Revolutionary era diverged toward the [[Romanticism]] of [[Edmund Burke]], [[Joseph de Maistre]] and [[Novalis]]. The victorious members of the Coalition had negotiated a new peaceful balance of powers in Vienna and agreed to maintain a stable German heartland that keeps French imperialism at bay. However, the idea of reforming the defunct [[Holy Roman Empire]] was discarded. [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]]'s [[German mediatization|reorganization of the German states]] was continued and the remaining princes were allowed to keep their titles. In 1813, in return for guarantees from the Allies that the sovereignty and integrity of the Southern German states ([[Grand Duchy of Baden|Baden]], [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]], and [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]]) would be preserved, they broke with France.{{sfn|Carr|1991|pp=1\u20132}}\n\n===German Confederation===\n{{main|German Confederation|North German Confederation}}\n\nDuring the 1815 [[Congress of Vienna]] the 39 former states of the ''Confederation of the Rhine'' joined the [[German Confederation]], a loose agreement for mutual defense. Attempts of economic integration and customs coordination were frustrated by repressive anti-national policies. Great Britain approved of the union, convinced that a stable, peaceful entity in central Europe could discourage aggressive moves by France or Russia. Most historians, however, concluded, that the Confederation was weak and ineffective and an obstacle to German nationalism. The union was undermined by the creation of the [[Zollverein]] in 1834, the [[German revolutions of 1848\u201349|1848 revolutions]], the rivalry between Prussia and Austria and was finally dissolved in the wake of the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866,{{sfn|Lee|1985|pp=332\u201346}} to be replaced by the [[North German Confederation]] during the same year.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Loyd E. |last=Lee |title=The German Confederation and the Consolidation of State Power in the South German States, 1815\u20131848 |journal=Consortium on Revolutionary Europe, 1750\u20131850: Proceedings |year=1985 |volume=15 |pages=332\u2013346 |issn=0093-2574 }}</ref>\n\n===Society and economy===\n\n====Population====\nBetween 1815 and 1865 the population of the German Confederation (excluding Austria) grew around 60% from 21 million to 34 million.{{sfn|Nipperdey|1996|p=86}} Simultaneously the [[Demographic Transition]] took place as the high birth rates and high death rates of the pre-industrial country shifted to low birth and death rates of the fast-growing industrialized urban economic and agricultural system. Increased agricultural productivity secured a steady food supply, as famines and epidemics declined. This allowed people to marry earlier, and have more children. The high birthrate was offset by a very high rate of infant mortality and after 1840, large-scale emigration to the [[United States]]. Emigration totaled at 480,000 in the 1840s, 1,200,000 in the 1850s, and at 780,000 in the 1860s. The upper and middle classes first practiced birth control, soon to be universally adopted.{{sfn|Nipperdey|1996|pp=87\u201392, 99}}\n\n====Industrialization====\n[[File:Krupp-Werke in Essen 1864.jpeg|thumb|220px|The [[Krupp|Krupp-Works]] in [[Essen]], 1864]]\nIn 1800, Germany's social structure was poorly suited to entrepreneurship or economic development. Domination by France during the French Revolution (1790s to 1815), however, produced important institutional reforms, that included the abolition of feudal restrictions on the sale of large landed estates, the reduction of the power of the guilds in the cities, and the introduction of a new, more efficient commercial law. The idea, that these reforms were beneficial for Industrialization has been contested.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/97701/1/787963348.pdf  |title=The French Revolution and German industrialization: The new institutional economics rewrites history  |publisher= Leibniz Institute of Agricultural Development in Transition Economies | author=Michael Kopsidis, Daniel W. Bromley  | accessdate= 13 April 2019 }}</ref> Nevertheless, traditionalism remained strong in the many small principalities. Until 1850, the guilds, the landed aristocracy, the churches and the government bureaucracies maintained many rules and restrictions that held entrepreneurship in low esteem and given little opportunity to develop. From the 1830s and 1840s, Prussia, Saxony and other states introduced agriculture based on sugar beets, turnips and potatoes, that yielded higher crops, which enabled a surplus rural population to move to industrial areas.\n\nIn the early 19th century the Industrial Revolution was in full swing in Britain, France, and Belgium. The various small federal states in Germany developed only slowly and independently as competition was strong. Early investments for the railway network during the 1830s came almost exclusively from private hands. Without a central regulatory agency the construction projects were quickly realized. Actual industrialization only took off after 1850 in the wake of the railroad construction.<ref name=\"Mitchell2006\"/> The textile industry grew rapidly, profiting from the elimination of tariff barriers by the Zollverein.<ref>{{citation | first=Richard | last=Tilly | chapter=Germany: 1815\u20131870 | editor-first=Rondo |editor-last=Cameron | title=Banking in the Early Stages of Industrialization: A Study in Comparative Economic History | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1967 | pages=151\u2013182}}</ref> During the second half of the 19th century the German industry grew exponentially and by 1900, Germany was an industrial world leader along with Britain and the United States.\n\nHistorian [[Thomas Nipperdey]] remarks:\n<blockquote>On the whole, industrialisation in Germany must be considered to have been positive in its effects. Not only did it change society and the countryside, and finally the world...it created the modern world we live in. It solved the problems of population growth, under-employment and pauperism in a stagnating economy, and abolished dependency on the natural conditions of agriculture, and finally hunger. It created huge improvements in production and both short- and long-term improvements in living standards. However, in terms of social inequality, it can be assumed that it did not change the relative levels of income. Between 1815 and 1873 the statistical distribution of wealth was on the order of 77% to 23% for entrepreneurs and workers respectively. On the other hand, new problems arose, in the form of interrupted growth and new crises, such as urbanisation, 'alienation', new underclasses, proletariat and proletarian misery, new injustices and new masters and, eventually, class warfare.<ref>Thomas Nipperdey, ''Germany from Napoleon to Bismarck: 1800\u20131866'' (1996) p 178</ref></blockquote>\n\n====Urbanization====\nIn 1800 the population was predominantly rural, as only 10% lived in communities of 5,000 or more people, and only 2% lived in cities of more than 100,000 people. After 1815, the urban population grew rapidly, due to the influx of young people from the rural areas. Berlin grew from 172,000 in 1800, to 826,000 inhabitants in 1870, Hamburg from 130,000 to 290,000, Munich from 40,000 to 269,000 and Dresden from 60,000 to 177,000.<ref>Nipperdey, ''Germany from Napoleon to Bismarck: 1800\u20131866'' (1996) pp. 96\u201397</ref>\n\n====Railways====\n{{Main|History of rail transport in Germany}}\n[[File:Friedrich List und die erste grosse Eisenbahn 2.jpg|thumb|[[Friedrich List]]'s concept for a German railway net from 1833]]\nThe takeoff stage of economic development came with the railroad revolution in the 1840s, which opened up new markets for local products, created a pool of middle managers, increased the demand for engineers, architects and skilled machinists and stimulated investments in coal and iron. Political disunity of three dozen states and a pervasive conservatism made it difficult to build railways in the 1830s. However, by the 1840s, trunk lines did link the major cities; each German state was responsible for the lines within its own borders. Economist [[Friedrich List]] summed up the advantages to be derived from the development of the railway system in 1841:\n* 1. As a means of national defence, it facilitates the concentration, distribution and direction of the army.\n* 2. It is a means to the improvement of the culture of the nation. It brings talent, knowledge and skill of every kind readily to market.\n* 3. It secures the community against dearth and famine, and against excessive fluctuation in the prices of the necessaries of life.\n* 4. It promotes the spirit of the nation, as it has a tendency to destroy the Philistine spirit arising from isolation and provincial prejudice and vanity. It binds nations by ligaments, and promotes an interchange of food and of commodities, thus making it feel to be a unit. The iron rails become a nerve system, which, on the one hand, strengthens public opinion, and, on the other hand, strengthens the power of the state for police and governmental purposes.<ref>Nipperdey, ''Germany from Napoleon to Bismarck: 1800\u20131866'' (1996) p.&nbsp;165</ref>\n\nLacking a technological base at first, engineering and hardware was imported from Britain. In many cities, the new railway shops were the centres of technological awareness and training, so that by 1850, Germany was self-sufficient in meeting the demands of railroad construction, and the railways were a major impetus for the growth of the new steel industry. Observers found that even as late as 1890, their engineering was inferior to Britain. However, German unification in 1870 stimulated consolidation, nationalisation into state-owned companies, and further rapid growth. Unlike the situation in France, the goal was the support of industrialisation. Eventually numerous lines criss-crossed the Ruhr area and other industrial centers and provided good connections to the major ports of Hamburg and Bremen. By 1880, 9,400 locomotives pulled 43,000 passengers and 30,000 tons of freight a day.<ref name=\"Mitchell2006\">{{cite book|author=Allan Mitchell|title=The Great Train Race: Railways and the Franco-German Rivalry, 1815\u20131914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mZ6pkm-WgWMC|year=2006|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-84545-136-3}}</ref>\n\n====Newspapers and magazines====\n{{main|History of German journalism|History of newspapers and magazines#Germany}}\nWhile there existed no national newspaper the many states issued a great variety of printed media, although they rarely exceeded regional significance. In a typical town existed one or two outlets, urban centers, such as Berlin and Leipzig had dozens. The audience was limited to a few percent of male adults, chiefly from the aristocratic and upper middle class. Liberal publishers outnumbered conservative ones by a wide margin. Foreign governments bribed editors to guarantee a favorable image.<ref>Theodore S. Hamerow, ''The Social Foundations of German Unification, 1858\u20131871: Ideas and Institutions'' (1969) pp 284\u201391</ref> Censorship was strict, and the imperial government issued the political news that was supposed to be published. After 1871, strict press laws were enforced by Bismarck to contain the Socialists and hostile editors. Editors focused on political commentary, culture, the arts, high culture and the popular serialized novels. Magazines were politically more influential and attracted intellectual authors.<ref>Kenneth E. Olson, ''The history makers: The press of Europe from its beginnings through 1965'' (LSU Press, 1966) pp 99\u2013134</ref>\n\n====Science and culture during the 18th and 19th century====\n19th-century artists and intellectuals were greatly inspired by the ideas of the French Revolution and the great poets and writers [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] (1749\u20131832), [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] (1729\u20131781) and [[Friedrich Schiller]] (1759\u20131805). The [[Sturm und Drang]] [[Romanticism|romantic]] movement was embraced and emotion was given free expression in reaction to the perceived rationalism of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Philosophical principles and methods were revolutionized by [[Immanuel Kant]]'s paradigm shift. [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] (1770\u20131827) was the most influential composer of the period from [[Classical period (music)|classical]] to [[Romantic music]]. His use of tonal architecture in such a way as to allow significant expansion of musical forms and structures was immediately recognized as bringing a new dimension to music. His later piano music and string quartets, especially, showed the way to a completely unexplored musical universe, and influenced [[Franz Schubert]] (1797\u20131828) and [[Robert Schumann]] (1810\u20131856). In opera, a new Romantic atmosphere combining supernatural terror and melodramatic plot in a folkloric context was first successfully achieved by [[Carl Maria von Weber]] (1786\u20131826) and perfected by [[Richard Wagner]] (1813\u20131883) in his [[Ring Cycle]]. The [[Brothers Grimm]] (1785\u20131863 & 1786\u20131859) collected folk stories into the popular [[Grimm's Fairy Tales]] and are ranked among the founding fathers of [[German studies]], who initiated the work on the [[Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch]] (\"The German Dictionary\"), the most comprehensive work on the German language.<ref>Elmer H. Antonsen, James W. Marchand, and Ladislav Zgusta, eds. ''The Grimm brothers and the Germanic past'' (John Benjamins Publishing, 1990).</ref>\n\nUniversity professors developed international reputations, especially in the humanities led by history and philology, which brought a new historical perspective to the study of political history, theology, philosophy, language, and literature. With [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] (1770\u20131831), [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]] (1775\u20131854), [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] (1788\u20131860), [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844\u20131900), [[Max Weber]] (1864\u20131920), [[Karl Marx]] (1818\u20131883) and [[Friedrich Engels]] (1820\u20131895) in philosophy, [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] (1768\u20131834) in theology and [[Leopold von Ranke]] (1795\u20131886) in history became famous. The [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]], founded in 1810, became the world's leading university. Von Ranke, for example, professionalized history and set the world standard for historiography. By the 1830s mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology had emerged with world class science, led by [[Alexander von Humboldt]] (1769\u20131859) in natural science and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] (1777\u20131855) in mathematics. Young intellectuals often turned to politics, but their support for the failed revolution of 1848 forced many into exile.<ref name=sheehan>{{cite book | first=James J. |last=Sheehan | title=German History: 1770\u20131866 | year=1989 | pages=75, 207\u2013291, 291\u2013323, 324\u2013371, 802\u2013820}}</ref>\n\n{{Gallery\n|title= 18th- and 19th-century German artists, scientists and philosophers\n|align=center\n|width=120\n|File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|[[Immanuel Kant]] (1724\u20131804)\n|File:Gotthold Ephraim Lessing.PNG|[[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] (1729\u20131781)\n|File:Goethe (Stieler 1828).jpg|[[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] (1749\u20131832)\n|File:Joseph v Fraunhofer.jpg|[[Joseph von Fraunhofer]] (1787\u20131826), physicist and optical lens manufacturer (1787\u20131826)\n|File:Friedrich Schiller by Ludovike Simanowiz.jpg|[[Friedrich Schiller]] (1759\u20131805)\n|File:AvHumboldt.jpg|[[Alexander von Humboldt]] (1769\u20131859)\n|File:Beethoven.jpg|[[Ludwig van Beethoven]] (1770\u20131827)\n|File:Hegel portrait by Schlesinger 1831.jpg|[[Friedrich Hegel]] (1770\u20131831)\n|File:Carl Friedrich Gauss.jpg|[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] (1777\u20131855)\n|File:Grimm.jpg|[[Brothers Grimm]] (1785\u20131863 & 1786\u20131859)\n|File:Ernst_Werner_von_Siemens.jpg|[[Werner von Siemens]] (1816\u20131892)\n|File:Karl Marx_001.jpg|[[Karl Marx]] (1818\u20131883)\n|\n}}\n\n====Religion====\n{{main|Prussian Union of churches}}\n[[File:Friedrich Wilhelm III., K\u00f6nig von Preu\u00dfen (unbekannter Maler).jpg|200px|right|thumb|King Frederick William III ruled Prussia 1797 to 1840]]\nTwo main developments reshaped religion in Germany. Across the land, there was a movement to unite the larger Lutheran and the smaller Reformed Protestant churches. The churches themselves brought this about in Baden, Nassau, and Bavaria. However, in Prussia King [[Frederick William III]] was determined to handle unification entirely on his own terms, without consultation. His goal was to unify the Protestant churches, and to impose a single standardized liturgy, organization and even architecture. The long-term goal was to have fully centralized royal control of all the Protestant churches. In a series of proclamations over several decades the [[Prussian Union of churches|''Church of the Prussian Union'']] was formed, bringing together the more numerous Lutherans, and the less numerous Reformed Protestants. The government of Prussia now had full control over church affairs, with the king himself recognized as the leading bishop. Opposition to unification came from the \"Old Lutherans\" in Silesia who clung tightly to the theological and liturgical forms they had followed since the days of Luther. The government attempted to crack down on them, so they went underground. Tens of thousands migrated, [[German Australian|to South Australia]], and especially to the United States, where they formed the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod|Missouri Synod]], which is still in operation as a conservative denomination. Finally in 1845 a new king [[Frederick William IV]] offered a general amnesty and allowed the Old Lutherans to form a separate church association with only nominal government control.<ref>Christopher Clark, ''Iron Kingdom'' (2006) pp 412\u201319</ref><ref>Christopher Clark, \"Confessional policy and the limits of state action: Frederick William III and the Prussian Church Union 1817\u201340.\" ''Historical Journal'' 39.04 (1996) pp: 985\u20131004. {{JSTOR|2639865}}</ref><ref>Hajo Holborn, ''A History of Modern Germany 1648\u20131840'' (1964) pp 485\u201391</ref>\n\nFrom the religious point of view of the typical Catholic or Protestant, major changes were underway in terms of a much more personalized religiosity that focused on the individual more than the church or the ceremony. The rationalism of the late 19th century faded away, and there was a new emphasis on the psychology and feeling of the individual, especially in terms of contemplating sinfulness, redemption, and the mysteries and the revelations of Christianity. [[Pietism|Pietistic revivals]] were common among Protestants. Among, Catholics there was a sharp increase in popular pilgrimages. In 1844 alone, half a million pilgrims made a pilgrimage to the city of Trier in the Rhineland to view the [[Seamless robe of Jesus]], said to be the robe that Jesus wore on the way to his crucifixion. Catholic bishops in Germany had historically been largely independent of Rome, but now the Vatican exerted increasing control, a new \"[[ultramontanism]]\" of Catholics highly loyal to Rome.<ref>Christopher Clark, ''Iron Kingdom'' (2006) pp 419\u201321</ref> A sharp controversy broke out in 1837\u201338 in the largely Catholic Rhineland over the religious education of children of mixed marriages, where the mother was Catholic and the father Protestant. The government passed laws to require that these children always be raised as Protestants, contrary to Napoleonic law that had previously prevailed and allowed the parents to make the decision. It put the Catholic Archbishop under house arrest. In 1840, the new King Frederick William IV sought reconciliation and ended the controversy by agreeing to most of the Catholic demands. However Catholic memories remained deep and led to a sense that Catholics always needed to stick together in the face of an untrustworthy government.<ref>Holborn, ''A History of Modern Germany 1648\u20131840'' (1964) pp 498\u2013509</ref>\n\n===Politics of restoration and revolution===\n{{Main|German Confederation}}\n\n====After Napoleon====\n[[File:Hambacher Fest 1832.jpg|thumb|At the [[Hambach Festival]] in 1832, intellectuals with various political backgrounds were among the first to use the future [[Flag of Germany]] and called for a [[German question|unified German nation]].]]\n[[File:Nationalversammlung in der Paulskirche.jpg|thumb|Frankfurt 1848]]\n[[File:Maerz1848 berlin.jpg|thumb|Liberal and nationalist pressure led to the unsuccessful [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848 in the German states]]]]\n[[File:BismarckRoonMoltke.jpg|thumb|[[Otto von Bismarck]], [[Albrecht Graf von Roon]] and [[Helmut von Moltke]], the senior political and military strategists of Prussia during the 1860s]]\nAfter the fall of Napoleon, Europe's statesmen convened in Vienna in 1815 for the reorganisation of European affairs, under the leadership of the [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Austrian Prince Metternich]]. The political principles agreed upon at this [[Congress of Vienna]] included the restoration, legitimacy and solidarity of rulers for the repression of revolutionary and nationalist ideas.\n\nThe [[German Confederation]] ({{lang-de|Deutscher Bund}}) was founded, a loose union of 39 states (35 ruling princes and 4 free cities) under Austrian leadership, with a Federal Diet ({{lang-de|[[Bundesversammlung (German Confederation)|Bundestag]]}}) meeting in [[Frankfurt am Main]]. It was a loose coalition that failed to satisfy most nationalists. The member states largely went their own way, and Austria had its own interests.\n\nIn 1819 a student radical assassinated the reactionary playwright [[August Friedrich Ferdinand von Kotzebue|August von Kotzebue]], who had scoffed at liberal student organisations. In one of the few major actions of the German Confederation, Prince Metternich called a conference that issued the repressive [[Carlsbad Decrees]], designed to suppress liberal agitation against the conservative governments of the German states.<ref>{{cite book | first=A.J.P. |last=Taylor | title=The Course of German History | year=2001 | page=52}}</ref> The Decrees terminated the fast-fading nationalist fraternities ({{lang-de|[[Burschenschaft]]en}}), removed liberal university professors, and expanded the censorship of the press.

In May the German National Assembly (the [[Frankfurt Parliament]]) met in Frankfurt to draw up a national German constitution.\n\nBut the 1848 revolution turned out to be unsuccessful: [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|King Frederick William IV of Prussia]] refused the imperial crown, the Frankfurt parliament was dissolved, the ruling princes repressed the risings by military force, and the German Confederation was re-established by 1850. Many leaders went into exile, including a number who went to the United States and became a political force there.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wittke|first1=C.

Dissent was vigorously suppressed, and many Germans emigrated to America following the collapse of the 1848 uprisings. Frederick William IV became extremely depressed and melancholic during this period, and was surrounded by men who advocated [[clericalism]] and [[Divine right of kings|absolute divine monarchy]]. The Prussian people once again lost interest in politics. Prussia not only expanded its territory but began to industrialize rapidly, while maintaining a strong agricultural base.\n\n====Bismarck takes charge (1862\u20131866)====\nIn 1857, the Prussian king [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Frederick William IV]] suffered a stroke and his brother [[William I, German Emperor|William]] served as regent until 1861 when he became King William I. Although conservative, William was very pragmatic. His most significant accomplishment was the naming of [[Otto von Bismarck]] as Prussian minister president in 1862. The cooperation of Bismarck, Defense Minister [[Albrecht von Roon]], and Field Marshal [[Helmut von Moltke]] set the stage for the military victories over Denmark, Austria, and France, that led to the unification of Germany.<ref>Holborn, ''A History of Modern Germany: 1840\u20131945'' pp 131\u201367</ref><ref>Edgar Feuchtwanger, ''Bismarck: A Political History'' (2nd ed., Routledge, 2014) pp 83\u201398</ref>\n\nIn 1863\u201364, disputes between Prussia and Denmark over [[Duchy of Schleswig|Schleswig]] escalated, which was not part of the German Confederation, and which Danish nationalists wanted to incorporate into the Danish kingdom. The conflict led to the [[Second War of Schleswig]] in 1864. Prussia, joined by Austria, easily defeated Denmark and occupied [[Jutland]]. The Danes were forced to cede both the Duchy of Schleswig and the [[Duchy of Holstein]] to Austria and Prussia. The subsequent management of the two duchies led to tensions between Austria and Prussia. Austria wanted the duchies to become an independent entity within the German Confederation, while Prussia intended to annex them. The disagreement served as a pretext for the [[Seven Weeks War]] between Austria and Prussia, that broke out in June 1866. In July, the two armies clashed at Sadowa-K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz (Bohemia) in an [[Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz|enormous battle]] involving half a million men. Prussian superior logistics and the modern breech-loading [[needle gun]]s superioity over the slow [[muzzle-loading rifle]]s of the Austrians, proved to be elementary for Prussia's victory.

He fostered alliances in Europe to contain France on the one hand and aspired to consolidate Germany's influence in Europe on the other. His principal domestic policies focused on the suppression of socialism and the reduction of the strong influence of the Roman Catholic Church on its adherents. He issued a series of anti-socialist laws in accord with a set of social laws, that included universal health care, pension plans and other social security programs. His [[Kulturkampf]] policies were vehemently resisted by Catholics, who organized political opposition in the Center (Zentrum) Party. German industrial and economic power had grown to match Britain by 1900.\n\nIn 1888, the young and ambitious Kaiser [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Wilhelm II]] became emperor. He rejected advice from experienced politicians and ordered Bismarck's resignation in 1890. He opposed Bismarck's careful and delicate foreign policy and was determined to pursue colonialist policies, as Britain and France had been doing for centuries. The Kaiser promoted the active colonization of Africa and Asia for the lands that were not already colonies of other European powers. The Kaiser took a mostly unilateral approach in Europe only allied with the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and embarked on a dangerous naval arms race with Britain. His aggressive and erroneous policies greatly contributed to the situation in which the assassination of the Austrian-Hungarian crown prince would spark off [[World War I]].\n\n===Bismarck era===\n\n====The new empire====\n[[File:Wernerprokla.jpg|thumb|200px|On 18 January 1871, the German Empire was proclaimed in the [[Hall of Mirrors]] of the [[Palace of Versailles]].

When Prussia suggested the Hohenzollern candidate, [[Leopold, Prince of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen|Prince Leopold]] as successor, France vehemently objected. The matter evolved into a [[Ems Dispatch|diplomatic scandal]] and in July 1870, France resolved to end it in a [[Franco-Prussian War|full-scale war]]. The conflict was quickly decided as Prussia, joined by forces of a pan-German alliance never gave up the tactical initiative. A series of victories in north-eastern France followed and another French army group was simultaneously encircled at Metz.

However, even Prussia itself, which accounted for two-thirds of the territory as well as of the population, had emerged from the empire's periphery as a newcomer. It also faced colossal cultural and economic internal divisions. The Prussian provinces of Westphalia and the Rhineland for example had been under French control [[Confederation of the Rhine|during the previous decades]].

The [[League of Three Emperors]] was signed in 1873 by Russia, Austria, and Germany. It stated that [[republicanism]] and [[socialism]] were common enemies and that the three powers would discuss any matters concerning foreign policy. Bismarck needed good relations with Russia in order to keep France isolated. Russia fought a victorious [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|war against the Ottoman Empire]] from 1877 to 1878 and attempted to [[Treaty of San Stefano|establish]] the [[Principality of Bulgaria]], that was strongly opposed by France and Britain in particular, as they were long concerned with the preservation of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and Russian containment at the [[Bosphorus Strait]] and the Black Sea. Germany hosted the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878, where a more moderate peace settlement was agreed upon.\n\nIn 1879, Germany formed the [[Dual Alliance (1879)|Dual Alliance]] with Austria-Hungary, an agreement of mutual military assistance in the case of an attack from Russia, which was not satisfied with the agreement of the Congress of Berlin. The establishment of the Dual Alliance led Russia to take a more conciliatory stance and in 1887, the so-called [[Reinsurance Treaty]] was signed between Germany and Russia. In it, the two powers agreed on mutual military support in the case that France attacked Germany or an Austrian attack on Russia. Russia turned its attention eastward to Asia and remained largely inactive in European politics for the next 25 years. In 1882, Italy, seeking supporters for its interests in [[North Africa]] against France's colonial policy, joined the Dual Alliance, which became the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]]. In return for German and Austrian support, Italy committed itself to assisting Germany in the case of a French attack.<ref>{{Citation | first=Patricia A. | last=Weitsman | title=Dangerous alliances: proponents of peace, weapons of war | year=2004 | page=79}}</ref>\n\nBismarck had always argued that the acquisition of overseas colonies was impractical and the burden of administration and maintenance would outweigh the benefits. Eventually, Bismarck gave way, and a number of colonies were established in Africa ([[Togo]], the [[Kamerun|Cameroons]], [[German South-West Africa]], and [[German East Africa]]) and in [[Oceania]] ([[German New Guinea]], the [[Bismarck Archipelago]], and the [[Marshall Islands]]). Consequently, Bismarck initiated the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1885, a formal meeting of the European colonial powers, who sought to \"established international guidelines for the acquisition of African territory\" (see [[Colonisation of Africa]]). Its outcome, the ''General Act of the Berlin Conference'', can be seen as the formalisation of the \"Scramble for Africa\" and \"[[New Imperialism]]\".<ref>{{cite book | first=Kirsten |last=Belgum | title=Popularizing the Nation: Audience, Representation, and the Production of Identity in \"Die Gartenlaube,\" 1853\u20131900 | year=1998 |page=149}}</ref>\n\n===Wilhelminian Era (1888\u20131918)===\n\n====Wilhelm II====\n[[File:1890 Bismarcks Ruecktritt.jpg|thumb|upright|\"[[Dropping the Pilot]]\" \u2013 British editorial cartoon depicting Bismarck's dismissal by Wilhelm II in 1890]]\nEmperor William I died in 1888.

Russia promptly formed a closer relationship with France in the [[Franco-Russian Alliance|Dual Alliance of 1894]], as both countries were concerned about the novel disagreeability of Germany. Furthermore, Anglo\u2013German relations provided, from a British point of view, no basis for any consensus as the Kaiser refused to divert from his, although somewhat peculiarly desperate and anachronistic, aggressive imperial engagement and the [[Anglo-German naval arms race|naval arms race]] in particular.

Germany stood behind its ally Austria in a confrontation with Serbia, but Serbia was under the protection of Russia, which was allied to France. Germany was the leader of the Central Powers, which included Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and later Bulgaria; arrayed against them were the Allies, consisting chiefly of Russia, France, Britain, and in 1915 Italy.\n\nIn explaining why neutral Britain went to war with Germany, author Paul M. Kennedy recognized it was critical for war that Germany become economically more powerful than Britain, but he downplays the disputes over economic trade imperialism, the Baghdad Railway, confrontations in Central and Eastern Europe, high-charged political rhetoric and domestic pressure-groups. Germany's reliance time and again on sheer power, while Britain increasingly appealed to moral sensibilities, played a role, especially in seeing the invasion of Belgium as a necessary military tactic or a profound moral crime. The German invasion of Belgium was not important because the British decision had already been made and the British were more concerned with the fate of France. Kennedy argues that by far the main reason was London's fear that a repeat of 1870&nbsp;\u2013 when Prussia and the German states smashed France&nbsp;\u2013 would mean that Germany, with a powerful army and navy, would control the English Channel and northwest France. British policy makers insisted that would be a catastrophe for British security.<ref>{{cite book | first=Paul M. |last=Kennedy | title=The Rise of the Anglo-German Antagonism, 1860\u20131914 | year=1980 | pages=464\u2013470}}</ref>\n\n====Western Front====\nIn the west, Germany sought a quick victory by encircling Paris using the [[Schlieffen Plan]]. But it failed due to Belgian resistance, Berlin's diversion of troops, and very stiff French resistance on the [[Marne (river)|Marne]], north of Paris.\n\nThe [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] became an extremely bloody battleground of [[trench warfare]]. The stalemate lasted from 1914 until early 1918, with ferocious battles that moved forces a few hundred yards at best along a line that stretched from the [[North Sea]] to the Swiss border. The British imposed a tight naval blockade in the [[North Sea]] which lasted until 1919, sharply reducing Germany's overseas access to raw materials and foodstuffs. Food scarcity became a serious problem by 1917.<ref>{{cite book | first=J.M. |last=Winter | title=Capital Cities at War: Paris, London, Berlin, 1914\u20131919 | year=1999}}</ref>\n\nThe United States joined with the Allies in April 1917.

In the east, there were decisive victories against the Russian army, the trapping and defeat of large parts of the Russian contingent at the [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Battle of Tannenberg]], followed by huge Austrian and German successes. The breakdown of Russian forces \u2013 exacerbated by internal turmoil caused by the 1917 [[Russian Revolution]] \u2013 led to the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Russia\u2013Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] the Bolsheviks were forced to sign on 3 March 1918 as Russia withdrew from the war.

Causes involved the transfer of many farmers and food workers into the military, an overburdened railroad system, shortages of coal, and the British blockade that cut off imports from abroad. The winter of 1916\u20131917 was known as the \"turnip winter,\" because that vegetable, usually fed to livestock, was used by people as a substitute for potatoes and meat, which were increasingly scarce. Thousands of soup kitchens were opened to feed the hungry people, who grumbled that the farmers were keeping the food for themselves. Even the army had to cut the rations for soldiers.<ref>{{cite book | first=Roger | last=Chickering | title=Imperial Germany and the Great War, 1914\u20131918 | year=2004 | pages=141\u201342}}</ref> Morale of both civilians and soldiers continued to sink.\n\n1918 was also the year of the deadly [[1918 flu pandemic|1918 Spanish Flu pandemic]] which struck hard at a population weakened by years of malnutrition.\n\n===Revolution 1918===\n{{main|German Revolution of 1918\u201319|Treaty of Versailles}}\n\nThe end of October 1918, in [[Wilhelmshaven]], in northern Germany, saw the beginning of the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319]]. Units of the German Navy refused to set sail for a last, large-scale operation in a war which they saw as good as lost, initiating the uprising. On 3 November, the revolt spread to other cities and states of the country, in many of which workers' and soldiers' councils were established. Meanwhile, Hindenburg and the senior commanders had lost confidence in the Kaiser and his government. The Kaiser and all German ruling princes abdicated. On 9 November 1918, the Social Democrat [[Philipp Scheidemann]] proclaimed a Republic.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 175-01448, Berlin, Reichskanzlei, Philipp Scheidemann.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Philipp Scheidemann]] proclaims a [[Weimar Republic|German Republic]] on 9 November 1918.]]\nOn 11 November, [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|the Compi\u00e8gne armistice]] was signed, ending the war. The [[Treaty of Versailles]] was signed on 28 June 1919. Germany was to cede Alsace-Lorraine to France. Eupen-Malm\u00e9dy would temporarily be ceded to Belgium, with a plebiscite to be held to allow the people the choice of the territory either remaining with Belgium or being returned to German control. Following a plebiscite, the territory was allotted to Belgium on 20 September 1920. The future of [[Northern Schleswig|North Schleswig]] was to be decided by plebiscite. In the [[Schleswig Plebiscites]], the Danish-speaking population in the north voted for Denmark and the southern, German speaking populace, part voted for Germany. Schleswig was thus partitioned. Holstein remained German without a referendum. [[Klaip\u0117da|Memel]] was ceded to the Allied and Associated powers, to decide the future of the area. On 9 January 1923, Lithuanian forces invaded the territory. Following negotiations, on 8 May 1924, the League of Nations ratified the annexation on the grounds that Lithuania accepted the [[Memel Statute]], a power-sharing arrangement to protect non-Lithuanians in the territory and its autonomous status. Until 1929, German-Lithuanian co-operation increased and this power sharing arrangement worked. Poland was restored and most of the provinces of [[Province of Posen|Posen]] and [[West Prussia]], and some areas of [[Upper Silesia]] were reincorporated into the reformed country after plebiscites and independence uprisings. All German colonies were to be handed over to League of Nations, who then assigned them as [[League of Nations mandate|Mandates]] to Australia, France, Japan, New Zealand, Portugal, and the United Kingdom. The new owners were required to act as a disinterested trustee over the region, promoting the welfare of its inhabitants in a variety of ways until they were able to govern themselves. The left and right banks of the Rhine were to be permanently demilitarised. The industrially important [[Saarland]] was to be governed by the [[League of Nations]] for 15 years and its coalfields administered by France. At the end of that time a plebiscite was to determine the Saar's future status. To ensure execution of the treaty's terms, Allied troops would occupy the left (German) bank of the Rhine for a period of 5\u201315 years. The German army was to be limited to 100,000 officers and men; the general staff was to be dissolved; vast quantities of war material were to be handed over and the manufacture of munitions rigidly curtailed. The navy was to be similarly reduced, and no military aircraft were allowed. Germany was also required to pay [[World War I reparations|reparations]] for all civilian damage caused during the war.\n\n==Weimar Republic, 1919\u20131933==\n{{Main|Weimar Republic}}\n\n===Overview===\n[[File:Karte des Deutschen Reiches, Weimarer Republik-Drittes Reich 1919\u20131937.svg|250px|thumb|right|Germany 1919\u20131938]]\n\nThe humiliating peace terms in the [[Treaty of Versailles]] provoked bitter indignation throughout Germany, and seriously weakened the new democratic regime. In December 1918, the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD) was founded, and in 1919 it tried and failed to overthrow the new republic. [[Adolf Hitler]] in 1919 took control of the new [[National Socialist German Workers' Party]] (NSDAP), which failed in a [[Beer Hall Putsch|coup in Munich in 1923]]. Both parties, as well as parties supporting the republic, built militant auxiliaries that engaged in increasingly violent street battles. Electoral support for both parties increased after 1929 as the Great Depression hit the economy hard, producing many unemployed men who became available for the paramilitary units. The Nazis (formerly the German Workers' Party), with a mostly rural and lower middle class base, overthrew the Weimar regime and ruled Germany in 1933\u20131945.\n\n===The early years===\nOn 11 August 1919, the [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] constitution came into effect, with [[Friedrich Ebert]] as first President.\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00015, Friedrich Ebert(cropped).jpg|thumb|150px|[[Friedrich Ebert]]]]\nOn 30 December 1918, the [[Communist Party of Germany]] was founded by the [[Spartacus League]], who had split from the Social Democratic Party during the war. It was headed by [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Karl Liebknecht]], and rejected the parliamentary system. In 1920, about 300,000 members from the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany]] joined the party, transforming it into a mass organization. The Communist Party had a following of about 10% of the electorate.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Deutscher Bundestag|title=The political parties in the Weimar Republic|url=http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/artandhistory/history/factsheets/parties_weimar_republic.pdf|accessdate=18 September 2011|date=March 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125164124/http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/artandhistory/history/factsheets/parties_weimar_republic.pdf|archive-date=25 November 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Flag of Germany (3-2 aspect ratio).svg|thumb|Flag of the Weimar Republic, 1919\u20131933]]\n\nIn the first months of 1920, the [[Reichswehr]] was to be reduced to 100,000 men, in accordance with the Treaty of Versailles. This included the dissolution of many [[Freikorps]] \u2013 units made up of volunteers. In an attempt at a coup d'\u00e9tat in March 1920, the [[Kapp Putsch]], extreme right-wing politician Wolfgang Kapp let Freikorps soldiers march on Berlin and proclaimed himself Chancellor of the Reich. After four days the coup d'\u00e9tat collapsed, due to popular opposition and lack of support by the civil servants and the officers. Other cities were shaken by strikes and rebellions, which were bloodily suppressed.\n\nGermany was the first state to establish diplomatic relations with the new [[Soviet Union]]. Under the [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1922|Treaty of Rapallo]], Germany accorded the Soviet Union ''de jure'' recognition, and the two signatories mutually cancelled all pre-war debts and renounced war claims.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1989-040-27, Gustav Stresemann.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Gustav Stresemann]], German Chancellor in 1923 and [[List of Nobel Peace Prize laureates|Nobel Peace Prize laureate]] in 1926]]\n\nWhen Germany defaulted on its reparation payments, French and Belgian troops occupied the heavily industrialised Ruhr district (January 1923). The German government encouraged the population of the Ruhr to [[passive resistance]]: shops would not sell goods to the foreign soldiers, coal-miners would not dig for the foreign troops, trams in which members of the occupation army had taken a seat would be left abandoned in the middle of the street. The passive resistance proved effective, insofar as the occupation became a loss-making deal for the French government. But the Ruhr fight also led to [[hyperinflation]], and many who lost all their fortune would become bitter enemies of the Weimar Republic, and voters of the anti-democratic right. See [[1920s German inflation]].\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-C06886, Paul v. Hindenburg.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul von Hindenburg]], German President in 1925\u20131934]]\n\nIn September 1923, the deteriorating economic conditions led Chancellor [[Gustav Stresemann]] to call an end to the passive resistance in the Ruhr. In November, his government introduced a new currency, the [[German rentenmark|Rentenmark]] (later: [[German reichsmark|Reichsmark]]), together with other measures to stop the hyperinflation. In the following six years the economic situation improved. In 1928, Germany's industrial production even regained the pre-war levels of 1913.\n\nThe national elections of 1924 led to a swing to the right. Field Marshal [[Paul von Hindenburg]] was [[1925 German presidential election|elected]] President in 1925.\n\nIn October 1925 the [[Treaty of Locarno]] was signed by Germany, France, Belgium, Britain and Italy; it recognised Germany's borders with France and Belgium. Moreover, Britain, Italy and Belgium undertook to assist France in the case that German troops marched into the demilitarised Rheinland. Locarno paved the way for Germany's admission to the [[League of Nations]] in 1926.\n\n===Reparations===\nThe actual amount of reparations that Germany was obliged to pay out was not the 132 billion marks decided in the London Schedule of 1921 but rather the 50 million marks stipulated in the A and B Bonds. Historian Sally Marks says the 112 billion marks in \"C bonds\" were entirely chimerical\u2014a device to fool the public into thinking Germany would pay much more. The actual total payout from 1920 to 1931 (when payments were suspended indefinitely) was 20 billion [[German gold mark]]s, worth about US$5 billion or \u00a31 billion British pounds. 12.5 billion was cash that came mostly from loans from New York bankers. The rest was goods like coal and chemicals, or from assets like railway equipment. The reparations bill was fixed in 1921 on the basis of a German capacity to pay, not on the basis of Allied claims. The highly publicized rhetoric of 1919 about paying for all the damages and all the veterans' benefits was irrelevant for the total, but it did determine how the recipients spent their share. Germany owed reparations chiefly to France, Britain, Italy and Belgium; the US received $100 million.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Marks | first1 = Sally | year = 1978 | title = The Myths of Reparations | journal = Central European History | volume = 11 | issue = 3| pages = 231\u201355 | jstor=4545835 | doi=10.1017/s0008938900018707}}</ref>\n\n===Economic collapse and political problems, 1929\u20131933===\nThe [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] marked the beginning of the worldwide [[Great Depression]], which hit Germany as hard as any nation. In July 1931, the ''Darmst\u00e4tter und Nationalbank'' \u2013 one of the biggest German banks \u2013 failed. In early 1932, the number of unemployed had soared to more than 6,000,000.\n\nOn top of the collapsing economy came a political crisis: the political parties represented in the ''Reichstag'' were unable to build a governing majority in the face of escalating extremism from the far right (the Nazis, NSDAP). In March 1930, President Hindenburg appointed [[Heinrich Br\u00fcning]] Chancellor, invoking article 48 of Weimar's constitution, which allowed him to override the Parliament. To push through his package of austerity measures against a majority of Social Democrats, Communists and the NSDAP (Nazis), Br\u00fcning made use of emergency decrees and dissolved Parliament. In March and April 1932, Hindenburg was re-elected in the [[1932 German presidential election|German presidential election of 1932]].{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=247\u2013283}}\n\nThe Nazi Party was the largest party in the national elections of 1932. On 31 July 1932 it received 37.3% of the votes, and in the election on 6 November 1932 it received less, but still the largest share, 33.1%, making it the biggest party in the ''Reichstag''. The Communist KPD came third, with 15%.<ref>Richard F. Hamilton, '' Who Voted for Hitler?'' (1982)</ref> Together, the anti-democratic parties of the far right were now able to hold a considerable share of seats in Parliament, but they were at sword's point with the political left, fighting it out in the streets. The Nazis were particularly successful among Protestants, among unemployed young voters, among the lower middle class in the cities and among the rural population. It was weakest in Catholic areas and in large cities. On 30 January 1933, pressured by former Chancellor [[Franz von Papen]] and other conservatives, President Hindenburg appointed Hitler as Chancellor.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=283\u2013308}}\n\n===Science and culture in 19th and 20th century===\n{{Main|Science and technology in Germany}}\nThe Weimar years saw a flowering of [[German science]] and high culture, before the Nazi regime resulted in a decline in the scientific and cultural life in Germany and forced many renowned scientists and writers to flee.\nGerman recipients dominated the [[Nobel laureates by country|Nobel prizes in science]].<ref>{{cite web | url= http://nobelprize.org/ | title = Nobel Prize | publisher= Nobelprize.org |accessdate=19 November 2009}}</ref> Germany dominated the world of physics before 1933, led by [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], [[Wilhelm Conrad R\u00f6ntgen]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Otto Hahn]], [[Max Planck]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]].

The [[Gestapo]] (secret police) under [[Heinrich Himmler]] destroyed the political opposition and persecuted the Jews, trying to force them into exile, while taking their property. The Party took control of the courts, local government, and all civic organizations except the Protestant and Catholic churches. All expressions of public opinion were controlled by Hitler's propaganda minister, [[Joseph Goebbels]], who made effective use of film, mass rallies, and Hitler's hypnotic speaking. The Nazi state idolized Hitler as its F\u00fchrer (leader), putting all powers in his hands. [[Nazi propaganda]] centered on Hitler and was quite effective in creating what historians called the \"Hitler Myth\"\u2014that Hitler was all-wise and that any mistakes or failures by others would be corrected when brought to his attention.<ref>{{cite book |first=Ian |last=Kershaw | authorlink =Ian Kershaw| title=The \"Hitler Myth\": Image and Reality in the Third Reich | year=2001|title-link=The \"Hitler Myth\": Image and Reality in the Third Reich }}</ref> In fact Hitler had a narrow range of interests and decision making was diffused among overlapping, feuding power centers; on some issues he was passive, simply assenting to pressures from whoever had his ear.

On the evening of 27 February 1933, the [[Reichstag fire|''Reichstag'' building was set afire]]. Hitler swiftly blamed an alleged Communist uprising, and convinced President Hindenburg to sign the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]], which rescinded most German civil liberties, including rights of assembly and freedom of the press. The decree allowed the police to detain people indefinitely without charges or a court order. Four thousand members of the [[Communist Party of Germany]] were arrested.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=329\u2013334}} Communist agitation was banned, but at this time not the Communist Party itself. Communists and Socialists were brought into hastily prepared [[Nazi concentration camp]]s such as [[Kemna concentration camp]], where they were at the mercy of the [[Gestapo]], the newly established secret police force. Communist ''Reichstag'' deputies were taken into [[protective custody]] (despite their constitutional privileges).\n\n[[File:WWII, Europe, Germany, \"Nazi Hierarchy, Hitler, Goering, Goebbels, Hess\", The Desperate Years p143 - NARA - 196509.jpg|thumb|Some of the leaders of the Nazi regime (left to right): [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], [[Joseph Goebbels]] and [[Rudolf Hess]]]]\nDespite the terror and unprecedented propaganda, the last free General Elections of 5 March 1933, while resulting in 43.9% failed to gave the majority for the NSDAP as Hitler had hoped. Together with the [[German National People's Party]] (DNVP), however, he was able to form a slim majority government. In March 1933, the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]], an amendment to the [[Weimar Constitution]], passed in the Reichstag by a vote of 444 to 94.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=354}} To obtain the two-thirds majority needed to pass the bill, accommodations were made to the Catholic [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], and the Nazis used the provisions of the Reichstag Fire Decree to keep several Social Democratic deputies from attending, and the Communists deputies had already been banned.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=336}} This amendment allowed Hitler and his cabinet to pass laws\u2014even laws that violated the constitution\u2014without the consent of the president or the Reichstag.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=351}} The Enabling Act formed the basis for the dictatorship, dissolution of the [[States of Germany|L\u00e4nder]]; the trade unions and all political parties other than the Nazi Party were suppressed. A centralised totalitarian state was established, no longer based on the liberal [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] constitution. Germany left the [[League of Nations]]. The coalition parliament was rigged by defining the absence of arrested and murdered deputies as voluntary and therefore cause for their exclusion as wilful absentees. Subsequently, in July the Centre Party was voluntarily dissolved in a ''quid pro quo'' with the [[Holy See|Pope]] under the ''anti-communist'' [[Pope Pius XI]] for the ''[[Reichskonkordat]]''; and by these manoeuvres Hitler achieved movement of these Catholic voters into the Nazi Party, and a long-awaited international diplomatic acceptance of his regime. According to Professor Dick Geary the Nazis gained a larger share of their vote in Protestant areas than in Catholic areas, in the elections held between 1928 and November 1932.<ref>{{cite journal | first=Dick | last=Geary | title=Who voted for the Nazis?

In response, Hitler used the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] and Gestapo to purge the entire SA leadership\u2014along with a number of Hitler's political adversaries (such as [[Gregor Strasser]] and former chancellor [[Kurt von Schleicher]]). It became known as the [[Night of the Long Knives]] and took place from 30 June to 2 July 1934.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=309\u2013314}} As a reward, the SS became an independent organisation under the command of the ''[[Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS]]'' Heinrich Himmler. He would rise to become Chief of German Police in June 1936 and already had control over the concentration camps system. Upon Hindenburg's death on 2 August 1934, Hitler's cabinet passed a law proclaiming the presidency to be vacant and transferred the role and powers of the head of state to Hitler as Chancellor and F\u00fchrer (Leader).\n\n===Antisemitism and the Holocaust===\n{{main|History of the Jews in Germany#Jews under the Nazis (1933\u201345)|The Holocaust}}\n[[File:Buchenwald-bei-Weimar-am-24-April-1945.jpg|thumb|U.S. Senator [[Alben W.

When opponents tried to appease him, he accepted the gains that were offered, then went to the next target. That aggressive strategy worked as Germany pulled out of the [[League of Nations]] (1933), rejected the [[Versailles Treaty]] and began to re-arm (1935), won back the Saar (1935), remilitarized the Rhineland (1936), formed an alliance (\"axis\") with Mussolini's Italy (1936), sent massive military aid to Franco in the Spanish Civil War (1936\u201339), annexed Austria (1938), took over Czechoslovakia after the British and French ''appeasement'' of the Munich Agreement of 1938, formed a peace pact with [[Joseph Stalin]]'s Soviet Union in August 1939, and finally invaded Poland on 1 September 1939.

On 12 March 1938, German troops marched into Austria, where an attempted Nazi coup had been unsuccessful in 1934. When Austrian-born Hitler entered [[Vienna]], he was greeted by loud cheers. Four weeks later, 99% of Austrians voted in favour of the annexation ([[Anschluss]]) of their country Austria to the [[German Reich]]. After Austria, Hitler turned to [[Czechoslovakia]], where the 3.5&nbsp;million-strong [[Sudeten German]] minority was demanding equal rights and self-government. At the [[Munich Agreement|Munich Conference]] of September 1938, Hitler, the Italian leader Benito Mussolini, British Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] and French Prime Minister [[\u00c9douard Daladier]] agreed upon the cession of Sudeten territory to the German Reich by [[Czechoslovakia]]. Hitler thereupon declared that all of German Reich's territorial claims had been fulfilled. However, hardly six months after the Munich Agreement, in March 1939, Hitler used the smoldering quarrel between [[Slovak people|Slovaks]] and [[Czechs]] as a pretext for taking over the rest of Czechoslovakia as the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]]. In the same month, he secured the return of [[Klaip\u0117da Region|Memel]] from [[Lithuania]] to Germany.

That meant that people had accumulated large paper assets, and that official prices and wages did not reflect reality, as the black market dominated the economy and more than half of all transactions were taking place unofficially. On 21 June 1948, the Western Allies withdrew the old currency and replaced it with the new [[Deutsche Mark]] at the rate of 1 new per 10 old. This wiped out 90% of government and private debt, as well as private savings. Prices were decontrolled, and labor unions agreed to accept a 15% wage increase, despite the 25% rise in prices. The result was that prices of German export products held steady, while profits and earnings from exports soared and were poured back into the economy. The currency reforms were simultaneous with the $1.4 billion in [[Marshall Plan]] money coming in from the United States, which was used primarily for investment.\n\nIn addition, the Marshall Plan forced German companies, as well as those in all of Western Europe, to modernize their business practices and take account of the international market. Marshall Plan funding helped overcome bottlenecks in the surging economy caused by remaining controls (which were removed in 1949), and Marshall Plan business reforms opened up a greatly expanded market for German exports. Overnight, consumer goods appeared in the stores, because they could be sold for realistic prices, emphasizing to Germans that their economy had turned a corner.<ref name=tipton />\n\nThe success of the currency reform angered the Soviets, who cut off all road, rail, and canal links between the western zones and [[West Berlin]].

Under his leadership, the German government sought to reduce tensions with the [[Soviet Union]] and improve relations with the [[German Democratic Republic]], a policy known as the ''[[Ostpolitik]]''.<ref name=weber/> Relations between the two German states had been icy at best, with propaganda barrages in each direction. The heavy outflow of talent from East Germany prompted the building of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1961, which worsened [[Cold War]] tensions and prevented East Germans from travel. Although anxious to relieve serious hardships for divided families and to reduce friction, Brandt's ''Ostpolitik'' was intent on holding to its concept of \"two German states in one German nation.\"\n\n''Ostpolitik'' was opposed by the conservative elements in Germany, but won Brandt an international reputation and the Nobel Peace Prize in 1971.<ref>{{cite book | editor-first=Carole |editor-last=Fink |editor2-first=Bernd |editor2-last=Schaefer | title=Ostpolitik, 1969\u20131974: European and Global Responses | year=2009}}</ref> In September 1973, both West and East Germany were admitted to the [[United Nations]].

The [[Ruhr]] region was hardest hit, as its easy-to-reach coal mines petered out, and expensive German coal was no longer competitive. Likewise the Ruhr steel industry went into sharp decline, as its prices were undercut by lower-cost suppliers such as Japan. The welfare system provided a safety net for the large number of unemployed workers, and many factories reduced their labor force and began to concentrate on high-profit specialty items. After 1990 the Ruhr moved into service industries and high technology. Cleaning up the heavy air and water pollution became a major industry in its own right. Meanwhile, formerly rural Bavaria became a high-tech center of industry.<ref name=ardagh/>\n\nA spy scandal forced Brandt to step down as Chancellor while remaining as party leader. He was replaced by [[Helmut Schmidt]] (b. 1918), of the SPD, who served as Chancellor in 1974\u20131982. Schmidt continued the ''Ostpolitik'' with less enthusiasm. He had a [[PhD]] in economics and was more interested in domestic issues, such as reducing [[inflation]]. The debt grew rapidly as he borrowed to cover the cost of the ever more expensive welfare state.<ref>{{cite book | first=Hans-Werner |last=Sinn |title=Can Germany be saved?: the malaise of the world's first welfare state | publisher=MIT Press | year=2007 | page=183}}</ref> After 1979, foreign policy issues grew central as the Cold War turned hot again. The German peace movement mobilized hundreds of thousands of demonstrators to protest against American deployment in Europe of new [[medium-range ballistic missile]]s.

Lambsdorff argued that the result would be economic growth, which would itself solve both the social problems and the financial problems. As a consequence, the FDP switched allegiance to the CDU and Schmidt lost his parliamentary majority in 1982.

Thousands of East Germans also tried to reach the West by staging sit-ins at West German diplomatic facilities in other East European capitals, most notably in Prague. The exodus generated demands within East Germany for political change, and [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|mass demonstrations in several cities]] continued to grow.\n\nUnable to stop the growing civil unrest, [[Erich Honecker]] was forced to resign in October, and on 9 November, East German authorities unexpectedly allowed East German citizens to enter West Berlin and West Germany. Hundreds of thousands of people took advantage of the opportunity; new crossing points were opened in the Berlin Wall and along the border with West Germany. This led to the acceleration of the process of reforms in East Germany that ended with the [[German reunification]] that came into force on 3 October 1990.<ref>For primary sources in English translation and a brief survey see Konrad H.

Proponents of the ''Sonderweg'' theory such as [[Fritz Fischer]] point to such events of the [[Revolution of 1848]], the [[authoritarianism]] of the Second Empire and the continuation of the Imperial elite into the Weimar and Nazi periods. Opponents such as [[Gerhard Ritter]] of the ''Sonderweg'' theory argue that proponents of the theory are guilty of seeking selective examples, and there was much contingency and chance in German history. In addition, there was much debate within the supporters of the ''Sonderweg'' concept as for the reasons for the ''Sonderweg'', and whether or not the ''Sonderweg'' ended in 1945. Was there a Sonderweg? Winkler says:\n:\"For a long time, educated Germans answered it in the positive, initially by laying claim to a special German mission, then, after the collapse of 1945, by criticizing Germany's deviation from the West. Today, the negative view is predominant. Germany did not, according to the now prevailing opinion, differ from the great European nations to an extent that would justify speaking of a 'unique German path.'

The victory of the [[Cherusci|Germanic tribes]] in the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] ([[AD]] 9) prevented annexation by the [[Roman Empire]], although the [[Roman provinces]] of [[Germania Superior]] and [[Germania Inferior]] were established along the [[Rhine]]. Following the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire]], the [[Franks]] conquered the other [[West Germanic languages|West]] [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]]. When the [[Francia|Frankish Empire]] was divided among [[Charles the Great]]'s heirs in 843, the eastern part became [[East Francia]]. In 962, [[Otto I]] became the first [[Holy Roman Emperor]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the medieval German state.\n\nIn the [[Late Middle Ages]], the regional dukes, princes, and bishops gained power at the expense of the emperors. [[Martin Luther]] led the [[Protestant Reformation]] against the Catholic Church after 1517, as the northern states became Protestant, while the southern states remained Catholic. The two parts of the Holy Roman Empire clashed in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648), which was ruinous to the twenty million civilians living in both parts. The Thirty Years' War brought tremendous destruction to Germany; more than 1/4 of the population and 1/2 of the male population in the German states were killed by the catastrophic war. 1648 marked the effective end of the Holy Roman Empire and the beginning of the modern nation-state system, with Germany divided into numerous independent states, such as [[Prussia]], [[Bavaria]], [[Saxony]], [[Austria]] and other states, which also controlled land outside of the area considered \"Germany\".\n\nAfter the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] from 1803\u20131815, feudalism fell away and liberalism and nationalism clashed with reaction. The German revolutions of 1848\u201349 failed. The [[Industrial Revolution]] modernized the German economy, led to the rapid growth of cities and the emergence of the [[History of socialism|socialist movement]] in Germany. Prussia, with its capital [[Berlin]], grew in power. German universities became world-class centers for science and humanities, while music and art flourished. The [[unification of Germany]] (excluding Austria and the German-speaking areas of Switzerland) was achieved under the leadership of the Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] with the formation of the [[German Empire]] in 1871.  This resulted in the ''[[German question|Kleindeutsche L\u00f6sung]]'', (\"small Germany solution\", Germany without Austria), rather than the ''Gro\u00dfdeutsche L\u00f6sung'', (\"greater Germany solution\", Germany with Austria). The new ''[[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]]'', an elected parliament, had only a limited role in the imperial government. Germany joined the other powers in [[German colonial empire|colonial expansion in Africa and the Pacific]].\n\nBy 1900, Germany was the dominant power on the European continent and its rapidly expanding industry had surpassed Britain's while provoking it in [[Anglo-German naval arms race|a naval arms race]]. Germany led the [[Central Powers]] in [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918) against France, Great Britain, Russia and (by 1917) the United States. Defeated and partly occupied, Germany was forced to pay [[war reparations]] by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and was stripped of its colonies as well as of home territory to be ceded to Belgium, France, and Poland, and was banned from uniting with [[Republic of German-Austria|German-settled regions of Austria]]. The [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319]] put an end to the [[Federal monarchy|federal]] [[constitutional monarchy]], which resulted in the establishment of the [[Weimar Republic]], an unstable parliamentary democracy.\n\nIn the early 1930s, the worldwide [[Great Depression]] hit Germany hard, as unemployment soared and people lost confidence in the government. In January 1933, [[Adolf Hitler]] was appointed [[Chancellor of Germany]]. His [[Nazi Party]] quickly established a [[totalitarian]] regime, and [[Nazi Germany]] made increasingly aggressive territorial demands, threatening war if they were not met. [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland]] came in 1936, then annexation of Austria in the ''[[Anschluss]]'' and German-speaking regions of Czechoslovakia with the [[Munich Agreement]] in 1938, and [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|further territory of Czechoslovakia]] in 1939. On 1 September 1939, Germany initiated [[World War II]] in Europe with the [[invasion of Poland]]. After forming a [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|pact with the Soviet Union]] in 1939, Hitler and Stalin divided Eastern Europe. After a \"[[Phoney War]]\" in spring 1940, the Germans swept Denmark and Norway, the Low Countries, and France, giving Germany control of nearly all of Western Europe. Hitler [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]] in June 1941.\n\nRacism, especially [[antisemitism]], was a central feature of the Nazi regime. In Germany, but predominantly in the [[German-occupied Europe|German-occupied areas]], the systematic [[genocide]] program known as [[the Holocaust]] killed 11 million, including Jews, German dissidents, disabled people, Poles, Romanies, Soviets (Russian and non-Russian), and others. In 1942, the German invasion of the Soviet Union faltered, and after the [[Military history of the United States during World War II|United States entered the war]], Britain became the base for massive [[Strategic bombing during World War II|Anglo-American bombings]] of German cities.  Following the Allied [[invasion of Normandy]] (June 1944), the German Army was pushed back on all fronts until the final collapse in May 1945.\n\nUnder [[Allied-occupied Germany|occupation by the Allies]], German territories were split up, Austria was again made a separate country, [[denazification]] took place, and the [[Cold War]] resulted in the division of the country into democratic [[Germany|West Germany]] and communist [[East Germany]], reduced in territory by the establishment of the [[Oder-Neisse line]]. Millions of ethnic Germans were deported from [[Former eastern territories of Germany|pre-war Eastern Germany]], [[Sudetenland]], and from [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944\u20131950)|all over Eastern Europe]], in what is described as the largest scale of ethnic cleansing in history.<ref> {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=D3IDT1RmI38C&printsec=frontcover&dq=gregor+thum+uprooted#v=snippet&q=ethnic%20cleansing&f=false|title=Uprooted: How Breslau Became Wroclaw during the Century of Expulsions|first=Gregor|last= Thum|page=55| year=2011|isbn=978-1-40083-996-4|publisher=Princeton University Press}}</ref>. Germans also fled from Communist areas into West Germany, which experienced rapid [[Wirtschaftswunder|economic expansion]], and became the dominant economy in Western Europe. West Germany was rearmed in the 1950s under the auspices of [[NATO]] but without access to nuclear weapons. The [[France\u2013Germany relations|Franco-German friendship]] became the basis for the political integration of Western Europe in the [[European Union]]. In 1989, the [[Berlin Wall]] was destroyed, the [[Soviet Union]] collapsed, and East Germany was [[Reunification of Germany|reunited with West Germany]] in 1990. In 1998\u20131999, Germany was one of the founding countries of the [[eurozone]]. Germany remains one of the economic powerhouses of Europe, contributing about one-quarter of the eurozone's annual [[gross domestic product]]. In the early 2010s, Germany played a critical role in trying to resolve the escalating euro crisis, especially concerning Greece and other [[Southern European]] nations. In the middle of the decade, the country faced the [[European migrant crisis]] as the main receiver of asylum seekers from [[Syria]] and other troubled regions.\n\n''For more events, see [[Timeline of German history]].''\n\n==Prehistory==\n{{Main|Prehistory of Germany}}\n[[Image:Homo steinheimensis, holotype.jpg|thumb|160px|The 250,000-year-old [[Steinheim Skull]]]]\nThe discovery of the [[Mauer 1|Homo heidelbergensis]] mandible in 1907 affirms archaic human presence in Germany by at least 600,000 years ago.{{sfn|Wagner|2010|pp=19726\u201319730}} The oldest complete set of hunting weapons ever found anywhere in the world was excavated from a coal mine in [[Sch\u00f6ningen]], [[Lower Saxony]].

A series of forts and commercial centers were established along the two rivers. Some tribes, such as the [[Ubii]] consequently allied with Rome and readily adopted advanced Roman culture. During the 1st century CE Roman legions conducted extended campaigns into [[Germania|Germania magna]], the area north of the Upper Danube and east of the Rhine, attempting to subdue the various tribes. Roman ideas of administration, the imposition of taxes and a legal framework were frustrated by the total absence of an infrastructure. The campaigns of [[Germanicus]], for example were almost exclusively characterized by frequent massacres of villagers and indiscriminate pillaging. The tribes, however maintained their elusive identities. In 9 AD a coalition of tribes under the [[Cherusci]] chieftain [[Arminius]], who was familiar with Roman tactical doctrines, defeated a sizeable Roman force in the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]]. Consequently, Rome resolved to permanently establish the Rhine/Danube border and refrain from further territorial advance into Germania.{{sfn|Smithsonian (September 2005)}}{{sfn|Ozment|2005|pp=2\u201321}} By AD 100 the frontier along the Rhine and the Danube and the [[Limes Germanicus]] was firmly established. Several Germanic tribes lived under Roman rule south and west of the border, as described in [[Tacitus]]'s ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]''. These lands represent the modern states [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], southern [[Bavaria]], southern [[Hesse]], [[Saarland]] and the [[Rhineland]].

The ideas of the reformation spread rapidly, as the new technology of the modern printing press ensured cheap mass copies and distribution of the theses and helped by the [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]]'s wars with France and the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]].<ref name=ski/> Hiding in the [[Wartburg Castle]], Luther translated the Bible into German, thereby greatly contributing to the establishment of the modern German language. This is highlighted by the fact that Luther spoke only a local dialect of minor importance during that time. After the publication of his Bible, his dialect suppressed others and constitutes to a great extent what is now modern German. With the [[Protestation at Speyer|protestation]] of the Lutheran princes at the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] of [[Second Diet of Speyer|Speyer]] in 1529 and the acceptance and adoption of the Lutheran [[Augsburg Confession]] by the Lutheran princes beginning in 1530, the separate Lutheran church was established.<ref>John Lotherington, ''The German Reformation'' (2014)</ref>\n\n{{Main|German Peasants' War}}\nThe 1524/25 [[German Peasants' War]], that began in the southwest in [[Alsace]] and [[Swabia]] and spread further east into [[Franconia]], [[Thuringia]] and Austria, was a series of economic and religious revolts of the rural lower classes, encouraged by the rhethoric of various radical religious reformers and Anabaptists against the ruling feudal lords. Although occasionally assisted by war-experienced noblemen like [[G\u00f6tz von Berlichingen]] and [[Florian Geyer]] (in Franconia) and the theologian [[Thomas M\u00fcntzer]] (in Thuringia), the peasant forces lacked military structure, skill, logistics and equipment and as many as 100,000 insurgents were eventually defeated and massacred by the territorial princes.<ref>Michael G.

Its intent was to challenge and contain the Protestant Reformation via apologetic and polemical writings and decrees, ecclesiastical reconfiguration, wars and imperial political maneuverings. In 1547 [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|emperor Charles V]] defeated the [[Schmalkaldic League]], a military alliance of Protestant rulers.<ref>John Lotherington, ''The Counter-Reformation'' (2015)</ref> The 1555 [[Peace of Augsburg]] decreed the recognition of the Lutheran Faith and religious division of the empire. It also stipulated the ruler's right to determine the official confession in his principality (''[[Cuius regio, eius religio]]''). The Counter-Reformation eventually failed to reintegrate the central and northern German Lutheran states.

The conflict increasingly evolved into a struggle between the French House of Bourbon and the House of Habsburg for predominance in Europe, for which the central German territories of the empire served as the battle ground.<ref>{{cite book | first=Peter H. |last=Wilson | title=The Thirty Years War: Europe's Tragedy | year=2009}}</ref>\n\nThe war ranks among the most catastrophic in history as three decades of constant warfare and destruction have left the land devastated. Marauding armies incessantly pillaged the countryside, seized and levied heavy taxes on cities and indiscriminately plundered the food stocks of the peasantry. There were also the countless bands of murderous outlaws, sick, homeless, disrupted people and invalid soldiery. Overall social and economic disruption caused a dramatic decline in population as a result of pandemic murder and random rape and killings, endemic infectious diseases, crop failures, famine, declining birth rates, wanton burglary, witch-hunts and the emigration of terrified people. Estimates vary between a 38% drop from 16 million people in 1618 to 10 million by 1650 and a mere 20% drop from 20 million to 16 million.

Luther's translation of the Bible into German was a decisive impulse for the increase of literacy and stimulated printing and distribution of religious books and pamphlets. From 1517 onward religious pamphlets flooded Germany and much of Europe. The Reformation instigated a media revolution as by 1530 over 10,000 individual works are published with a total of ten million copies. Luther strengthened his attacks on Rome by depicting a \"good\" against \"bad\" church. It soon became clear that print could be used for propaganda in the Reformation for particular agendas. Reform writers used pre-Reformation styles, clich\u00e9s, and stereotypes and changed items as needed for their own purposes.<ref>{{cite book | first=Mark U. | last=Edwards, Jr. | title=Printing, Propaganda, and Martin Luther | year=1994}}</ref> Especially effective were Luther's ''Small Catechism'', for use of parents teaching their children, and ''Larger Catechism,'' for pastors.<ref>See texts at [http://www.projectwittenberg.org/pub/resources/text/wittenberg/wittenberg-luther.html#sw-hymn Project Wittenberg: \"Selected Hymns of Martin Luther\"]</ref> Using the German vernacular they expressed the Apostles' Creed in simpler, more personal, Trinitarian language. Illustrations in the newly translated Bible and in many tracts popularized Luther's ideas. [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] (1472\u20131553), the great painter patronized by the electors of Wittenberg, was a close friend of Luther, and illustrated Luther's theology for a popular audience. He dramatized Luther's views on the relationship between the Old and New Testaments, while remaining mindful of Luther's careful distinctions about proper and improper uses of visual imagery.<ref>{{cite journal | first=Christoph |last=Weimer |title=Luther and Cranach on Justification in Word and Image | journal=Lutheran Quarterly | year=2004 | volume =18 |issue=4 |pages=387\u2013405}}</ref>\n\nLuther's German translation of the Bible was also decisive for the [[German language]] and its evolution from [[Early New High German]] to Modern Standard. His bible promoted the development of non-local forms of language and exposed all speakers to forms of German from outside their own area.\n\n===Science===\nThe German astronomical community played a central role in Europe in the early modern period. Several non-German scientists contributed to the community, such as [[Copernicus]], the instigator of the [[scientific revolution]] who lived in [[Royal Prussia]], a dependency of the King of Poland and [[Tycho Brahe]], who worked in [[Kingdom of Denmark|Denmark]] and [[Kingdom of Bohemia (1526-1648)|Bohemia]].

The empire's pluralistic character also applied to its nobility, that greatly varied in power and wealth, ideas, ambition, loyalty and education. However, there existed the distinction between the ''Imperial nobility'', the direct vassals of the emperor and the ''Territorial nobility'', who have received their [[fief]] from the [[Imperial Estate|territorial princes]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.holyromanempireassociation.com/imperial-nobility-of-germany.html  |title=The Imperial Nobility of Germany  |publisher= Holy Roman Empire Association  | accessdate= 14 April 2019 }}</ref> Many of whom had been impoverished as their standard of life and culture had declined since the end of the Medieval period. In an ever more complex economy, they struggled to compete with the patricians and merchants of the cities. The Thirty Years War marked the reversal of fortunes for those noblemen, who seized the initiative and had understood the requirements of higher education for a lucrative position in the post-war territorial administration. In the Prussian lands east of the Elbe river the system of [[Manorialism|manorial jurisdiction]] guaranteed near universal legal power and economic freedom for the local lords, called [[Junker]]s, who dominated not only the localities, but also the Prussian court, and especially the Prussian army. Increasingly after 1815, a centralized Prussian government based in Berlin took over the powers of the nobles, which in terms of control over the peasantry had been almost absolute. To help the nobility avoid indebtedness, Berlin set up a credit institution to provide capital loans in 1809, and extended the loan network to peasants in 1849. When the German Empire was established in 1871, the Junker nobility controlled the army and the Navy, the bureaucracy, and the royal court; they generally set governmental policies.<ref>{{cite book | first=Eda | last=Segarra | title=A Social History of Germany: 1648\u20131914 | year=1977 | pages=37\u201355, 183\u2013202}}</ref>\n\n===Peasants and rural life===\nPeasants continued to center their lives in the village, where they were members of a corporate body, and to help manage the community resources and monitor the community life. In the East, they were serfs who were bound permanently to parcels of land. In most of Germany, farming was handled by tenant farmers who paid rents and obligatory services to the landlord, who was typically a nobleman. Peasant leaders supervised the fields and ditches and grazing rights, maintained public order and morals, and supported a village court which handled minor offenses. Inside the family the patriarch made all the decisions, and tried to arrange advantageous marriages for his children. Much of the villages' communal life centered around church services and holy days. In Prussia, the peasants drew lots to choose conscripts required by the army.

A bank was set up so that landowners could borrow government money to buy land from peasants (the peasants were not allowed to use it to borrow money to buy land until 1850). The result was that the large landowners obtained larger estates, and many peasants became landless tenants, or moved to the cities or to America. The other German states imitated Prussia after 1815. In sharp contrast to the violence that characterized land reform in the French Revolution, Germany handled it peacefully. In Schleswig the peasants, who had been influenced by the Enlightenment, played an active role; elsewhere they were largely passive. Indeed, for most peasants, customs and traditions continued largely unchanged, including the old habits of deference to the nobles whose legal authority remained quite strong over the villagers. Although the peasants were no longer tied to the same land as serfs had been, the old paternalistic relationship in East Prussia lasted into the 20th century.<ref name=sagarra/>\n\nThe agrarian reforms in northwestern Germany in the era 1770\u20131870 were driven by progressive governments and local elites. They abolished [[feudal obligations]] and divided collectively owned common land into private parcels and thus created a more efficient market-oriented rural economy, which increased productivity and population growth and strengthened the traditional social order because wealthy peasants obtained most of the former common land, while the rural proletariat was left without land; many left for the cities or America.

In order to secure a satisfactory marriage, a woman needed to bring a substantial dowry. In the wealthier families, daughters received their dowry from their families, whereas the poorer women needed to work in order to save their wages so as to improve their chances to wed. Under the German laws, women had property rights over their dowries and inheritances, a valuable benefit as high mortality rates resulted in successive marriages.

War broke out in 1792 as Austria and Prussia invaded France, but were defeated at the [[Battle of Valmy]] (1792). The German lands saw armies marching back and forth, bringing devastation (albeit on a far lower scale than the [[Thirty Years' War]], almost two centuries before), but also bringing new ideas of liberty and civil rights for the people.

Domination by France during the French Revolution (1790s to 1815), however, produced important institutional reforms, that included the abolition of feudal restrictions on the sale of large landed estates, the reduction of the power of the guilds in the cities, and the introduction of a new, more efficient commercial law.

Until 1850, the guilds, the landed aristocracy, the churches and the government bureaucracies maintained many rules and restrictions that held entrepreneurship in low esteem and given little opportunity to develop. From the 1830s and 1840s, Prussia, Saxony and other states introduced agriculture based on sugar beets, turnips and potatoes, that yielded higher crops, which enabled a surplus rural population to move to industrial areas.\n\nIn the early 19th century the Industrial Revolution was in full swing in Britain, France, and Belgium. The various small federal states in Germany developed only slowly and independently as competition was strong. Early investments for the railway network during the 1830s came almost exclusively from private hands. Without a central regulatory agency the construction projects were quickly realized. Actual industrialization only took off after 1850 in the wake of the railroad construction.<ref name=\"Mitchell2006\"/> The textile industry grew rapidly, profiting from the elimination of tariff barriers by the Zollverein.<ref>{{citation | first=Richard | last=Tilly | chapter=Germany: 1815\u20131870 | editor-first=Rondo |editor-last=Cameron | title=Banking in the Early Stages of Industrialization: A Study in Comparative Economic History | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1967 | pages=151\u2013182}}</ref> During the second half of the 19th century the German industry grew exponentially and by 1900, Germany was an industrial world leader along with Britain and the United States.\n\nHistorian [[Thomas Nipperdey]] remarks:\n<blockquote>On the whole, industrialisation in Germany must be considered to have been positive in its effects. Not only did it change society and the countryside, and finally the world...it created the modern world we live in. It solved the problems of population growth, under-employment and pauperism in a stagnating economy, and abolished dependency on the natural conditions of agriculture, and finally hunger. It created huge improvements in production and both short- and long-term improvements in living standards. However, in terms of social inequality, it can be assumed that it did not change the relative levels of income. Between 1815 and 1873 the statistical distribution of wealth was on the order of 77% to 23% for entrepreneurs and workers respectively. On the other hand, new problems arose, in the form of interrupted growth and new crises, such as urbanisation, 'alienation', new underclasses, proletariat and proletarian misery, new injustices and new masters and, eventually, class warfare.<ref>Thomas Nipperdey, ''Germany from Napoleon to Bismarck: 1800\u20131866'' (1996) p 178</ref></blockquote>\n\n====Urbanization====\nIn 1800 the population was predominantly rural, as only 10% lived in communities of 5,000 or more people, and only 2% lived in cities of more than 100,000 people. After 1815, the urban population grew rapidly, due to the influx of young people from the rural areas. Berlin grew from 172,000 in 1800, to 826,000 inhabitants in 1870, Hamburg from 130,000 to 290,000, Munich from 40,000 to 269,000 and Dresden from 60,000 to 177,000.<ref>Nipperdey, ''Germany from Napoleon to Bismarck: 1800\u20131866'' (1996) pp. 96\u201397</ref>\n\n====Railways====\n{{Main|History of rail transport in Germany}}\n[[File:Friedrich List und die erste grosse Eisenbahn 2.jpg|thumb|[[Friedrich List]]'s concept for a German railway net from 1833]]\nThe takeoff stage of economic development came with the railroad revolution in the 1840s, which opened up new markets for local products, created a pool of middle managers, increased the demand for engineers, architects and skilled machinists and stimulated investments in coal and iron. Political disunity of three dozen states and a pervasive conservatism made it difficult to build railways in the 1830s. However, by the 1840s, trunk lines did link the major cities; each German state was responsible for the lines within its own borders. Economist [[Friedrich List]] summed up the advantages to be derived from the development of the railway system in 1841:\n* 1. As a means of national defence, it facilitates the concentration, distribution and direction of the army.\n* 2. It is a means to the improvement of the culture of the nation. It brings talent, knowledge and skill of every kind readily to market.\n* 3. It secures the community against dearth and famine, and against excessive fluctuation in the prices of the necessaries of life.\n* 4. It promotes the spirit of the nation, as it has a tendency to destroy the Philistine spirit arising from isolation and provincial prejudice and vanity. It binds nations by ligaments, and promotes an interchange of food and of commodities, thus making it feel to be a unit. The iron rails become a nerve system, which, on the one hand, strengthens public opinion, and, on the other hand, strengthens the power of the state for police and governmental purposes.<ref>Nipperdey, ''Germany from Napoleon to Bismarck: 1800\u20131866'' (1996) p.&nbsp;165</ref>\n\nLacking a technological base at first, engineering and hardware was imported from Britain. In many cities, the new railway shops were the centres of technological awareness and training, so that by 1850, Germany was self-sufficient in meeting the demands of railroad construction, and the railways were a major impetus for the growth of the new steel industry. Observers found that even as late as 1890, their engineering was inferior to Britain. However, German unification in 1870 stimulated consolidation, nationalisation into state-owned companies, and further rapid growth. Unlike the situation in France, the goal was the support of industrialisation. Eventually numerous lines criss-crossed the Ruhr area and other industrial centers and provided good connections to the major ports of Hamburg and Bremen. By 1880, 9,400 locomotives pulled 43,000 passengers and 30,000 tons of freight a day.<ref name=\"Mitchell2006\">{{cite book|author=Allan Mitchell|title=The Great Train Race: Railways and the Franco-German Rivalry, 1815\u20131914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mZ6pkm-WgWMC|year=2006|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-84545-136-3}}</ref>\n\n====Newspapers and magazines====\n{{main|History of German journalism|History of newspapers and magazines#Germany}}\nWhile there existed no national newspaper the many states issued a great variety of printed media, although they rarely exceeded regional significance. In a typical town existed one or two outlets, urban centers, such as Berlin and Leipzig had dozens. The audience was limited to a few percent of male adults, chiefly from the aristocratic and upper middle class. Liberal publishers outnumbered conservative ones by a wide margin. Foreign governments bribed editors to guarantee a favorable image.<ref>Theodore S.

After 1871, strict press laws were enforced by Bismarck to contain the Socialists and hostile editors. Editors focused on political commentary, culture, the arts, high culture and the popular serialized novels. Magazines were politically more influential and attracted intellectual authors.<ref>Kenneth E. Olson, ''The history makers: The press of Europe from its beginnings through 1965'' (LSU Press, 1966) pp 99\u2013134</ref>\n\n====Science and culture during the 18th and 19th century====\n19th-century artists and intellectuals were greatly inspired by the ideas of the French Revolution and the great poets and writers [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] (1749\u20131832), [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] (1729\u20131781) and [[Friedrich Schiller]] (1759\u20131805). The [[Sturm und Drang]] [[Romanticism|romantic]] movement was embraced and emotion was given free expression in reaction to the perceived rationalism of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Philosophical principles and methods were revolutionized by [[Immanuel Kant]]'s paradigm shift. [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] (1770\u20131827) was the most influential composer of the period from [[Classical period (music)|classical]] to [[Romantic music]]. His use of tonal architecture in such a way as to allow significant expansion of musical forms and structures was immediately recognized as bringing a new dimension to music. His later piano music and string quartets, especially, showed the way to a completely unexplored musical universe, and influenced [[Franz Schubert]] (1797\u20131828) and [[Robert Schumann]] (1810\u20131856). In opera, a new Romantic atmosphere combining supernatural terror and melodramatic plot in a folkloric context was first successfully achieved by [[Carl Maria von Weber]] (1786\u20131826) and perfected by [[Richard Wagner]] (1813\u20131883) in his [[Ring Cycle]]. The [[Brothers Grimm]] (1785\u20131863 & 1786\u20131859) collected folk stories into the popular [[Grimm's Fairy Tales]] and are ranked among the founding fathers of [[German studies]], who initiated the work on the [[Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch]] (\"The German Dictionary\"), the most comprehensive work on the German language.<ref>Elmer H. Antonsen, James W. Marchand, and Ladislav Zgusta, eds. ''The Grimm brothers and the Germanic past'' (John Benjamins Publishing, 1990).</ref>\n\nUniversity professors developed international reputations, especially in the humanities led by history and philology, which brought a new historical perspective to the study of political history, theology, philosophy, language, and literature. With [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] (1770\u20131831), [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]] (1775\u20131854), [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] (1788\u20131860), [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844\u20131900), [[Max Weber]] (1864\u20131920), [[Karl Marx]] (1818\u20131883) and [[Friedrich Engels]] (1820\u20131895) in philosophy, [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] (1768\u20131834) in theology and [[Leopold von Ranke]] (1795\u20131886) in history became famous. The [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]], founded in 1810, became the world's leading university. Von Ranke, for example, professionalized history and set the world standard for historiography. By the 1830s mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology had emerged with world class science, led by [[Alexander von Humboldt]] (1769\u20131859) in natural science and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] (1777\u20131855) in mathematics. Young intellectuals often turned to politics, but their support for the failed revolution of 1848 forced many into exile.<ref name=sheehan>{{cite book | first=James J. |last=Sheehan | title=German History: 1770\u20131866 | year=1989 | pages=75, 207\u2013291, 291\u2013323, 324\u2013371, 802\u2013820}}</ref>\n\n{{Gallery\n|title= 18th- and 19th-century German artists, scientists and philosophers\n|align=center\n|width=120\n|File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|[[Immanuel Kant]] (1724\u20131804)\n|File:Gotthold Ephraim Lessing.PNG|[[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] (1729\u20131781)\n|File:Goethe (Stieler 1828).jpg|[[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] (1749\u20131832)\n|File:Joseph v Fraunhofer.jpg|[[Joseph von Fraunhofer]] (1787\u20131826), physicist and optical lens manufacturer (1787\u20131826)\n|File:Friedrich Schiller by Ludovike Simanowiz.jpg|[[Friedrich Schiller]] (1759\u20131805)\n|File:AvHumboldt.jpg|[[Alexander von Humboldt]] (1769\u20131859)\n|File:Beethoven.jpg|[[Ludwig van Beethoven]] (1770\u20131827)\n|File:Hegel portrait by Schlesinger 1831.jpg|[[Friedrich Hegel]] (1770\u20131831)\n|File:Carl Friedrich Gauss.jpg|[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] (1777\u20131855)\n|File:Grimm.jpg|[[Brothers Grimm]] (1785\u20131863 & 1786\u20131859)\n|File:Ernst_Werner_von_Siemens.jpg|[[Werner von Siemens]] (1816\u20131892)\n|File:Karl Marx_001.jpg|[[Karl Marx]] (1818\u20131883)\n|\n}}\n\n====Religion====\n{{main|Prussian Union of churches}}\n[[File:Friedrich Wilhelm III., K\u00f6nig von Preu\u00dfen (unbekannter Maler).jpg|200px|right|thumb|King Frederick William III ruled Prussia 1797 to 1840]]\nTwo main developments reshaped religion in Germany. Across the land, there was a movement to unite the larger Lutheran and the smaller Reformed Protestant churches. The churches themselves brought this about in Baden, Nassau, and Bavaria. However, in Prussia King [[Frederick William III]] was determined to handle unification entirely on his own terms, without consultation. His goal was to unify the Protestant churches, and to impose a single standardized liturgy, organization and even architecture. The long-term goal was to have fully centralized royal control of all the Protestant churches. In a series of proclamations over several decades the [[Prussian Union of churches|''Church of the Prussian Union'']] was formed, bringing together the more numerous Lutherans, and the less numerous Reformed Protestants. The government of Prussia now had full control over church affairs, with the king himself recognized as the leading bishop. Opposition to unification came from the \"Old Lutherans\" in Silesia who clung tightly to the theological and liturgical forms they had followed since the days of Luther. The government attempted to crack down on them, so they went underground. Tens of thousands migrated, [[German Australian|to South Australia]], and especially to the United States, where they formed the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod|Missouri Synod]], which is still in operation as a conservative denomination. Finally in 1845 a new king [[Frederick William IV]] offered a general amnesty and allowed the Old Lutherans to form a separate church association with only nominal government control.<ref>Christopher Clark, ''Iron Kingdom'' (2006) pp 412\u201319</ref><ref>Christopher Clark, \"Confessional policy and the limits of state action: Frederick William III and the Prussian Church Union 1817\u201340.\" ''Historical Journal'' 39.04 (1996) pp: 985\u20131004. {{JSTOR|2639865}}</ref><ref>Hajo Holborn, ''A History of Modern Germany 1648\u20131840'' (1964) pp 485\u201391</ref>\n\nFrom the religious point of view of the typical Catholic or Protestant, major changes were underway in terms of a much more personalized religiosity that focused on the individual more than the church or the ceremony. The rationalism of the late 19th century faded away, and there was a new emphasis on the psychology and feeling of the individual, especially in terms of contemplating sinfulness, redemption, and the mysteries and the revelations of Christianity. [[Pietism|Pietistic revivals]] were common among Protestants. Among, Catholics there was a sharp increase in popular pilgrimages. In 1844 alone, half a million pilgrims made a pilgrimage to the city of Trier in the Rhineland to view the [[Seamless robe of Jesus]], said to be the robe that Jesus wore on the way to his crucifixion. Catholic bishops in Germany had historically been largely independent of Rome, but now the Vatican exerted increasing control, a new \"[[ultramontanism]]\" of Catholics highly loyal to Rome.<ref>Christopher Clark, ''Iron Kingdom'' (2006) pp 419\u201321</ref> A sharp controversy broke out in 1837\u201338 in the largely Catholic Rhineland over the religious education of children of mixed marriages, where the mother was Catholic and the father Protestant. The government passed laws to require that these children always be raised as Protestants, contrary to Napoleonic law that had previously prevailed and allowed the parents to make the decision. It put the Catholic Archbishop under house arrest. In 1840, the new King Frederick William IV sought reconciliation and ended the controversy by agreeing to most of the Catholic demands. However Catholic memories remained deep and led to a sense that Catholics always needed to stick together in the face of an untrustworthy government.<ref>Holborn, ''A History of Modern Germany 1648\u20131840'' (1964) pp 498\u2013509</ref>\n\n===Politics of restoration and revolution===\n{{Main|German Confederation}}\n\n====After Napoleon====\n[[File:Hambacher Fest 1832.jpg|thumb|At the [[Hambach Festival]] in 1832, intellectuals with various political backgrounds were among the first to use the future [[Flag of Germany]] and called for a [[German question|unified German nation]].]]\n[[File:Nationalversammlung in der Paulskirche.jpg|thumb|Frankfurt 1848]]\n[[File:Maerz1848 berlin.jpg|thumb|Liberal and nationalist pressure led to the unsuccessful [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848 in the German states]]]]\n[[File:BismarckRoonMoltke.jpg|thumb|[[Otto von Bismarck]], [[Albrecht Graf von Roon]] and [[Helmut von Moltke]], the senior political and military strategists of Prussia during the 1860s]]\nAfter the fall of Napoleon, Europe's statesmen convened in Vienna in 1815 for the reorganisation of European affairs, under the leadership of the [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Austrian Prince Metternich]]. The political principles agreed upon at this [[Congress of Vienna]] included the restoration, legitimacy and solidarity of rulers for the repression of revolutionary and nationalist ideas.\n\nThe [[German Confederation]] ({{lang-de|Deutscher Bund}}) was founded, a loose union of 39 states (35 ruling princes and 4 free cities) under Austrian leadership, with a Federal Diet ({{lang-de|[[Bundesversammlung (German Confederation)|Bundestag]]}}) meeting in [[Frankfurt am Main]]. It was a loose coalition that failed to satisfy most nationalists. The member states largely went their own way, and Austria had its own interests.\n\nIn 1819 a student radical assassinated the reactionary playwright [[August Friedrich Ferdinand von Kotzebue|August von Kotzebue]], who had scoffed at liberal student organisations. In one of the few major actions of the German Confederation, Prince Metternich called a conference that issued the repressive [[Carlsbad Decrees]], designed to suppress liberal agitation against the conservative governments of the German states.<ref>{{cite book | first=A.J.P. |last=Taylor | title=The Course of German History | year=2001 | page=52}}</ref> The Decrees terminated the fast-fading nationalist fraternities ({{lang-de|[[Burschenschaft]]en}}), removed liberal university professors, and expanded the censorship of the press.

As industrialisation developed, the need for a unified German state with a uniform currency, legal system, and government became more and more obvious.\n\n====1848====\n{{Main|Revolutions of 1848 in the German states}}\nGrowing discontent with the political and social order imposed by the Congress of Vienna led to the outbreak, in 1848, of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|March Revolution]] in the German states. In May the German National Assembly (the [[Frankfurt Parliament]]) met in Frankfurt to draw up a national German constitution.\n\nBut the 1848 revolution turned out to be unsuccessful: [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|King Frederick William IV of Prussia]] refused the imperial crown, the Frankfurt parliament was dissolved, the ruling princes repressed the risings by military force, and the German Confederation was re-established by 1850. Many leaders went into exile, including a number who went to the United States and became a political force there.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wittke|first1=C.

Dissent was vigorously suppressed, and many Germans emigrated to America following the collapse of the 1848 uprisings. Frederick William IV became extremely depressed and melancholic during this period, and was surrounded by men who advocated [[clericalism]] and [[Divine right of kings|absolute divine monarchy]]. The Prussian people once again lost interest in politics. Prussia not only expanded its territory but began to industrialize rapidly, while maintaining a strong agricultural base.\n\n====Bismarck takes charge (1862\u20131866)====\nIn 1857, the Prussian king [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Frederick William IV]] suffered a stroke and his brother [[William I, German Emperor|William]] served as regent until 1861 when he became King William I. Although conservative, William was very pragmatic. His most significant accomplishment was the naming of [[Otto von Bismarck]] as Prussian minister president in 1862. The cooperation of Bismarck, Defense Minister [[Albrecht von Roon]], and Field Marshal [[Helmut von Moltke]] set the stage for the military victories over Denmark, Austria, and France, that led to the unification of Germany.<ref>Holborn, ''A History of Modern Germany: 1840\u20131945'' pp 131\u201367</ref><ref>Edgar Feuchtwanger, ''Bismarck: A Political History'' (2nd ed., Routledge, 2014) pp 83\u201398</ref>\n\nIn 1863\u201364, disputes between Prussia and Denmark over [[Duchy of Schleswig|Schleswig]] escalated, which was not part of the German Confederation, and which Danish nationalists wanted to incorporate into the Danish kingdom. The conflict led to the [[Second War of Schleswig]] in 1864. Prussia, joined by Austria, easily defeated Denmark and occupied [[Jutland]]. The Danes were forced to cede both the Duchy of Schleswig and the [[Duchy of Holstein]] to Austria and Prussia. The subsequent management of the two duchies led to tensions between Austria and Prussia. Austria wanted the duchies to become an independent entity within the German Confederation, while Prussia intended to annex them. The disagreement served as a pretext for the [[Seven Weeks War]] between Austria and Prussia, that broke out in June 1866. In July, the two armies clashed at Sadowa-K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz (Bohemia) in an [[Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz|enormous battle]] involving half a million men. Prussian superior logistics and the modern breech-loading [[needle gun]]s superioity over the slow [[muzzle-loading rifle]]s of the Austrians, proved to be elementary for Prussia's victory. The battle had also decided the [[Austria\u2013Prussia rivalry|struggle for hegemony]] in Germany and Bismarck was deliberately lenient with defeated Austria, that was to play only a subordinate role in future German affairs.<ref>Holborn, ''A History of Modern Germany: 1840\u20131945'' pp 167\u201388</ref><ref>Feuchtwanger, ''Bismarck: A Political History'' (2014) pp 99\u2013147</ref>\n\n====North German Confederation, 1866\u20131871====\n{{Main|North German Confederation}}\n\nAfter the [[Seven Weeks War]] the German Confederation was dissolved and the [[North German Federation]] (German ''Norddeutscher Bund'') was established under the leadership of Prussia.

He fostered alliances in Europe to contain France on the one hand and aspired to consolidate Germany's influence in Europe on the other. His principal domestic policies focused on the suppression of socialism and the reduction of the strong influence of the Roman Catholic Church on its adherents. He issued a series of anti-socialist laws in accord with a set of social laws, that included universal health care, pension plans and other social security programs. His [[Kulturkampf]] policies were vehemently resisted by Catholics, who organized political opposition in the Center (Zentrum) Party. German industrial and economic power had grown to match Britain by 1900.\n\nIn 1888, the young and ambitious Kaiser [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Wilhelm II]] became emperor. He rejected advice from experienced politicians and ordered Bismarck's resignation in 1890. He opposed Bismarck's careful and delicate foreign policy and was determined to pursue colonialist policies, as Britain and France had been doing for centuries. The Kaiser promoted the active colonization of Africa and Asia for the lands that were not already colonies of other European powers. The Kaiser took a mostly unilateral approach in Europe only allied with the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and embarked on a dangerous naval arms race with Britain. His aggressive and erroneous policies greatly contributed to the situation in which the assassination of the Austrian-Hungarian crown prince would spark off [[World War I]].\n\n===Bismarck era===\n\n====The new empire====\n[[File:Wernerprokla.jpg|thumb|200px|On 18 January 1871, the German Empire was proclaimed in the [[Hall of Mirrors]] of the [[Palace of Versailles]].

When Prussia suggested the Hohenzollern candidate, [[Leopold, Prince of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen|Prince Leopold]] as successor, France vehemently objected. The matter evolved into a [[Ems Dispatch|diplomatic scandal]] and in July 1870, France resolved to end it in a [[Franco-Prussian War|full-scale war]]. The conflict was quickly decided as Prussia, joined by forces of a pan-German alliance never gave up the tactical initiative. A series of victories in north-eastern France followed and another French army group was simultaneously encircled at Metz. A few weeks later, the French army contingent under Emperor [[Napoleon III]]'s personal command was finally forced to capitulate in the [[Battle of Sedan|fortress of Sedan]].<ref name=\"R\u00fcstow1872\">{{cite book|author=Wilhelm R\u00fcstow|title=The War for the Rhine Frontier, 1870: Its Political and Military History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9cBVAAAAYAAJ|year=1872|publisher=Blackwood}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=miun.acj5737.0001.001;view=1up;seq=11 |title= History of the war between Germany and France | publisher = HathiTrust Digital Library |author=James D.

The starving city surrendered in January 1871 and Jules Favre signed the surrender at Versailles. France was forced to pay indemnities of 5&nbsp;billion francs and cede [[Alsace-Lorraine]] to Germany.

However, even Prussia itself, which accounted for two-thirds of the territory as well as of the population, had emerged from the empire's periphery as a newcomer. It also faced colossal cultural and economic internal divisions. The Prussian provinces of Westphalia and the Rhineland for example had been under French control [[Confederation of the Rhine|during the previous decades]].

The [[League of Three Emperors]] was signed in 1873 by Russia, Austria, and Germany. It stated that [[republicanism]] and [[socialism]] were common enemies and that the three powers would discuss any matters concerning foreign policy. Bismarck needed good relations with Russia in order to keep France isolated. Russia fought a victorious [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|war against the Ottoman Empire]] from 1877 to 1878 and attempted to [[Treaty of San Stefano|establish]] the [[Principality of Bulgaria]], that was strongly opposed by France and Britain in particular, as they were long concerned with the preservation of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and Russian containment at the [[Bosphorus Strait]] and the Black Sea. Germany hosted the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878, where a more moderate peace settlement was agreed upon.\n\nIn 1879, Germany formed the [[Dual Alliance (1879)|Dual Alliance]] with Austria-Hungary, an agreement of mutual military assistance in the case of an attack from Russia, which was not satisfied with the agreement of the Congress of Berlin. The establishment of the Dual Alliance led Russia to take a more conciliatory stance and in 1887, the so-called [[Reinsurance Treaty]] was signed between Germany and Russia. In it, the two powers agreed on mutual military support in the case that France attacked Germany or an Austrian attack on Russia. Russia turned its attention eastward to Asia and remained largely inactive in European politics for the next 25 years. In 1882, Italy, seeking supporters for its interests in [[North Africa]] against France's colonial policy, joined the Dual Alliance, which became the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]]. In return for German and Austrian support, Italy committed itself to assisting Germany in the case of a French attack.<ref>{{Citation | first=Patricia A. | last=Weitsman | title=Dangerous alliances: proponents of peace, weapons of war | year=2004 | page=79}}</ref>\n\nBismarck had always argued that the acquisition of overseas colonies was impractical and the burden of administration and maintenance would outweigh the benefits. Eventually, Bismarck gave way, and a number of colonies were established in Africa ([[Togo]], the [[Kamerun|Cameroons]], [[German South-West Africa]], and [[German East Africa]]) and in [[Oceania]] ([[German New Guinea]], the [[Bismarck Archipelago]], and the [[Marshall Islands]]). Consequently, Bismarck initiated the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1885, a formal meeting of the European colonial powers, who sought to \"established international guidelines for the acquisition of African territory\" (see [[Colonisation of Africa]]). Its outcome, the ''General Act of the Berlin Conference'', can be seen as the formalisation of the \"Scramble for Africa\" and \"[[New Imperialism]]\".<ref>{{cite book | first=Kirsten |last=Belgum | title=Popularizing the Nation: Audience, Representation, and the Production of Identity in \"Die Gartenlaube,\" 1853\u20131900 | year=1998 |page=149}}</ref>\n\n===Wilhelminian Era (1888\u20131918)===\n\n====Wilhelm II====\n[[File:1890 Bismarcks Ruecktritt.jpg|thumb|upright|\"[[Dropping the Pilot]]\" \u2013 British editorial cartoon depicting Bismarck's dismissal by Wilhelm II in 1890]]\nEmperor William I died in 1888.

Russia promptly formed a closer relationship with France in the [[Franco-Russian Alliance|Dual Alliance of 1894]], as both countries were concerned about the novel disagreeability of Germany. Furthermore, Anglo\u2013German relations provided, from a British point of view, no basis for any consensus as the Kaiser refused to divert from his, although somewhat peculiarly desperate and anachronistic, aggressive imperial engagement and the [[Anglo-German naval arms race|naval arms race]] in particular. Von Holstein's analysis proved to be mistaken on every point, Wilhelm, however, failed too, as he did not adopt a nuanced political dialogue.

Germany stood behind its ally Austria in a confrontation with Serbia, but Serbia was under the protection of Russia, which was allied to France. Germany was the leader of the Central Powers, which included Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and later Bulgaria; arrayed against them were the Allies, consisting chiefly of Russia, France, Britain, and in 1915 Italy.\n\nIn explaining why neutral Britain went to war with Germany, author Paul M. Kennedy recognized it was critical for war that Germany become economically more powerful than Britain, but he downplays the disputes over economic trade imperialism, the Baghdad Railway, confrontations in Central and Eastern Europe, high-charged political rhetoric and domestic pressure-groups. Germany's reliance time and again on sheer power, while Britain increasingly appealed to moral sensibilities, played a role, especially in seeing the invasion of Belgium as a necessary military tactic or a profound moral crime. The German invasion of Belgium was not important because the British decision had already been made and the British were more concerned with the fate of France. Kennedy argues that by far the main reason was London's fear that a repeat of 1870&nbsp;\u2013 when Prussia and the German states smashed France&nbsp;\u2013 would mean that Germany, with a powerful army and navy, would control the English Channel and northwest France. British policy makers insisted that would be a catastrophe for British security.<ref>{{cite book | first=Paul M. |last=Kennedy | title=The Rise of the Anglo-German Antagonism, 1860\u20131914 | year=1980 | pages=464\u2013470}}</ref>\n\n====Western Front====\nIn the west, Germany sought a quick victory by encircling Paris using the [[Schlieffen Plan]]. But it failed due to Belgian resistance, Berlin's diversion of troops, and very stiff French resistance on the [[Marne (river)|Marne]], north of Paris.\n\nThe [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] became an extremely bloody battleground of [[trench warfare]]. The stalemate lasted from 1914 until early 1918, with ferocious battles that moved forces a few hundred yards at best along a line that stretched from the [[North Sea]] to the Swiss border. The British imposed a tight naval blockade in the [[North Sea]] which lasted until 1919, sharply reducing Germany's overseas access to raw materials and foodstuffs. Food scarcity became a serious problem by 1917.<ref>{{cite book | first=J.M. |last=Winter | title=Capital Cities at War: Paris, London, Berlin, 1914\u20131919 | year=1999}}</ref>\n\nThe United States joined with the Allies in April 1917. The entry of the United States into the war \u2013 following Germany's declaration of unrestricted submarine warfare \u2013 marked a decisive turning-point against Germany.<ref>{{cite book | first=Hew | last=Strachan | title=The First World War | year=2004}}</ref>\n\n====Eastern Front====\nMore wide open was the fighting on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]]. In the east, there were decisive victories against the Russian army, the trapping and defeat of large parts of the Russian contingent at the [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Battle of Tannenberg]], followed by huge Austrian and German successes. The breakdown of Russian forces \u2013 exacerbated by internal turmoil caused by the 1917 [[Russian Revolution]] \u2013 led to the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Russia\u2013Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] the Bolsheviks were forced to sign on 3 March 1918 as Russia withdrew from the war. It gave Germany control of Eastern Europe.

[http://afs.sagepub.com/content/3/1/121 online]\n</ref>\nMeanwhile, conditions deteriorated rapidly on the home front, with severe food shortages reported in all urban areas. Causes involved the transfer of many farmers and food workers into the military, an overburdened railroad system, shortages of coal, and the British blockade that cut off imports from abroad. The winter of 1916\u20131917 was known as the \"turnip winter,\" because that vegetable, usually fed to livestock, was used by people as a substitute for potatoes and meat, which were increasingly scarce. Thousands of soup kitchens were opened to feed the hungry people, who grumbled that the farmers were keeping the food for themselves. Even the army had to cut the rations for soldiers.<ref>{{cite book | first=Roger | last=Chickering | title=Imperial Germany and the Great War, 1914\u20131918 | year=2004 | pages=141\u201342}}</ref> Morale of both civilians and soldiers continued to sink.\n\n1918 was also the year of the deadly [[1918 flu pandemic|1918 Spanish Flu pandemic]] which struck hard at a population weakened by years of malnutrition.\n\n===Revolution 1918===\n{{main|German Revolution of 1918\u201319|Treaty of Versailles}}\n\nThe end of October 1918, in [[Wilhelmshaven]], in northern Germany, saw the beginning of the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319]]. Units of the German Navy refused to set sail for a last, large-scale operation in a war which they saw as good as lost, initiating the uprising. On 3 November, the revolt spread to other cities and states of the country, in many of which workers' and soldiers' councils were established. Meanwhile, Hindenburg and the senior commanders had lost confidence in the Kaiser and his government. The Kaiser and all German ruling princes abdicated. On 9 November 1918, the Social Democrat [[Philipp Scheidemann]] proclaimed a Republic.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 175-01448, Berlin, Reichskanzlei, Philipp Scheidemann.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Philipp Scheidemann]] proclaims a [[Weimar Republic|German Republic]] on 9 November 1918.]]\nOn 11 November, [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|the Compi\u00e8gne armistice]] was signed, ending the war. The [[Treaty of Versailles]] was signed on 28 June 1919. Germany was to cede Alsace-Lorraine to France. Eupen-Malm\u00e9dy would temporarily be ceded to Belgium, with a plebiscite to be held to allow the people the choice of the territory either remaining with Belgium or being returned to German control. Following a plebiscite, the territory was allotted to Belgium on 20 September 1920. The future of [[Northern Schleswig|North Schleswig]] was to be decided by plebiscite. In the [[Schleswig Plebiscites]], the Danish-speaking population in the north voted for Denmark and the southern, German speaking populace, part voted for Germany. Schleswig was thus partitioned. Holstein remained German without a referendum. [[Klaip\u0117da|Memel]] was ceded to the Allied and Associated powers, to decide the future of the area. On 9 January 1923, Lithuanian forces invaded the territory. Following negotiations, on 8 May 1924, the League of Nations ratified the annexation on the grounds that Lithuania accepted the [[Memel Statute]], a power-sharing arrangement to protect non-Lithuanians in the territory and its autonomous status. Until 1929, German-Lithuanian co-operation increased and this power sharing arrangement worked. Poland was restored and most of the provinces of [[Province of Posen|Posen]] and [[West Prussia]], and some areas of [[Upper Silesia]] were reincorporated into the reformed country after plebiscites and independence uprisings. All German colonies were to be handed over to League of Nations, who then assigned them as [[League of Nations mandate|Mandates]] to Australia, France, Japan, New Zealand, Portugal, and the United Kingdom. The new owners were required to act as a disinterested trustee over the region, promoting the welfare of its inhabitants in a variety of ways until they were able to govern themselves. The left and right banks of the Rhine were to be permanently demilitarised. The industrially important [[Saarland]] was to be governed by the [[League of Nations]] for 15 years and its coalfields administered by France. At the end of that time a plebiscite was to determine the Saar's future status. To ensure execution of the treaty's terms, Allied troops would occupy the left (German) bank of the Rhine for a period of 5\u201315 years. The German army was to be limited to 100,000 officers and men; the general staff was to be dissolved; vast quantities of war material were to be handed over and the manufacture of munitions rigidly curtailed. The navy was to be similarly reduced, and no military aircraft were allowed. Germany was also required to pay [[World War I reparations|reparations]] for all civilian damage caused during the war.\n\n==Weimar Republic, 1919\u20131933==\n{{Main|Weimar Republic}}\n\n===Overview===\n[[File:Karte des Deutschen Reiches, Weimarer Republik-Drittes Reich 1919\u20131937.svg|250px|thumb|right|Germany 1919\u20131938]]\n\nThe humiliating peace terms in the [[Treaty of Versailles]] provoked bitter indignation throughout Germany, and seriously weakened the new democratic regime. In December 1918, the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD) was founded, and in 1919 it tried and failed to overthrow the new republic. [[Adolf Hitler]] in 1919 took control of the new [[National Socialist German Workers' Party]] (NSDAP), which failed in a [[Beer Hall Putsch|coup in Munich in 1923]]. Both parties, as well as parties supporting the republic, built militant auxiliaries that engaged in increasingly violent street battles. Electoral support for both parties increased after 1929 as the Great Depression hit the economy hard, producing many unemployed men who became available for the paramilitary units. The Nazis (formerly the German Workers' Party), with a mostly rural and lower middle class base, overthrew the Weimar regime and ruled Germany in 1933\u20131945.\n\n===The early years===\nOn 11 August 1919, the [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] constitution came into effect, with [[Friedrich Ebert]] as first President.\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00015, Friedrich Ebert(cropped).jpg|thumb|150px|[[Friedrich Ebert]]]]\nOn 30 December 1918, the [[Communist Party of Germany]] was founded by the [[Spartacus League]], who had split from the Social Democratic Party during the war. It was headed by [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Karl Liebknecht]], and rejected the parliamentary system. In 1920, about 300,000 members from the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany]] joined the party, transforming it into a mass organization. The Communist Party had a following of about 10% of the electorate.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Deutscher Bundestag|title=The political parties in the Weimar Republic|url=http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/artandhistory/history/factsheets/parties_weimar_republic.pdf|accessdate=18 September 2011|date=March 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125164124/http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/artandhistory/history/factsheets/parties_weimar_republic.pdf|archive-date=25 November 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Flag of Germany (3-2 aspect ratio).svg|thumb|Flag of the Weimar Republic, 1919\u20131933]]\n\nIn the first months of 1920, the [[Reichswehr]] was to be reduced to 100,000 men, in accordance with the Treaty of Versailles. This included the dissolution of many [[Freikorps]] \u2013 units made up of volunteers. In an attempt at a coup d'\u00e9tat in March 1920, the [[Kapp Putsch]], extreme right-wing politician Wolfgang Kapp let Freikorps soldiers march on Berlin and proclaimed himself Chancellor of the Reich. After four days the coup d'\u00e9tat collapsed, due to popular opposition and lack of support by the civil servants and the officers. Other cities were shaken by strikes and rebellions, which were bloodily suppressed.\n\nGermany was the first state to establish diplomatic relations with the new [[Soviet Union]]. Under the [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1922|Treaty of Rapallo]], Germany accorded the Soviet Union ''de jure'' recognition, and the two signatories mutually cancelled all pre-war debts and renounced war claims.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1989-040-27, Gustav Stresemann.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Gustav Stresemann]], German Chancellor in 1923 and [[List of Nobel Peace Prize laureates|Nobel Peace Prize laureate]] in 1926]]\n\nWhen Germany defaulted on its reparation payments, French and Belgian troops occupied the heavily industrialised Ruhr district (January 1923). The German government encouraged the population of the Ruhr to [[passive resistance]]: shops would not sell goods to the foreign soldiers, coal-miners would not dig for the foreign troops, trams in which members of the occupation army had taken a seat would be left abandoned in the middle of the street. The passive resistance proved effective, insofar as the occupation became a loss-making deal for the French government. But the Ruhr fight also led to [[hyperinflation]], and many who lost all their fortune would become bitter enemies of the Weimar Republic, and voters of the anti-democratic right. See [[1920s German inflation]].\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-C06886, Paul v. Hindenburg.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul von Hindenburg]], German President in 1925\u20131934]]\n\nIn September 1923, the deteriorating economic conditions led Chancellor [[Gustav Stresemann]] to call an end to the passive resistance in the Ruhr. In November, his government introduced a new currency, the [[German rentenmark|Rentenmark]] (later: [[German reichsmark|Reichsmark]]), together with other measures to stop the hyperinflation. In the following six years the economic situation improved. In 1928, Germany's industrial production even regained the pre-war levels of 1913.\n\nThe national elections of 1924 led to a swing to the right. Field Marshal [[Paul von Hindenburg]] was [[1925 German presidential election|elected]] President in 1925.\n\nIn October 1925 the [[Treaty of Locarno]] was signed by Germany, France, Belgium, Britain and Italy; it recognised Germany's borders with France and Belgium. Moreover, Britain, Italy and Belgium undertook to assist France in the case that German troops marched into the demilitarised Rheinland. Locarno paved the way for Germany's admission to the [[League of Nations]] in 1926.\n\n===Reparations===\nThe actual amount of reparations that Germany was obliged to pay out was not the 132 billion marks decided in the London Schedule of 1921 but rather the 50 million marks stipulated in the A and B Bonds. Historian Sally Marks says the 112 billion marks in \"C bonds\" were entirely chimerical\u2014a device to fool the public into thinking Germany would pay much more. The actual total payout from 1920 to 1931 (when payments were suspended indefinitely) was 20 billion [[German gold mark]]s, worth about US$5 billion or \u00a31 billion British pounds. 12.5 billion was cash that came mostly from loans from New York bankers. The rest was goods like coal and chemicals, or from assets like railway equipment. The reparations bill was fixed in 1921 on the basis of a German capacity to pay, not on the basis of Allied claims. The highly publicized rhetoric of 1919 about paying for all the damages and all the veterans' benefits was irrelevant for the total, but it did determine how the recipients spent their share. Germany owed reparations chiefly to France, Britain, Italy and Belgium; the US received $100 million.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Marks | first1 = Sally | year = 1978 | title = The Myths of Reparations | journal = Central European History | volume = 11 | issue = 3| pages = 231\u201355 | jstor=4545835 | doi=10.1017/s0008938900018707}}</ref>\n\n===Economic collapse and political problems, 1929\u20131933===\nThe [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] marked the beginning of the worldwide [[Great Depression]], which hit Germany as hard as any nation. In July 1931, the ''Darmst\u00e4tter und Nationalbank'' \u2013 one of the biggest German banks \u2013 failed. In early 1932, the number of unemployed had soared to more than 6,000,000.\n\nOn top of the collapsing economy came a political crisis: the political parties represented in the ''Reichstag'' were unable to build a governing majority in the face of escalating extremism from the far right (the Nazis, NSDAP). In March 1930, President Hindenburg appointed [[Heinrich Br\u00fcning]] Chancellor, invoking article 48 of Weimar's constitution, which allowed him to override the Parliament. To push through his package of austerity measures against a majority of Social Democrats, Communists and the NSDAP (Nazis), Br\u00fcning made use of emergency decrees and dissolved Parliament. In March and April 1932, Hindenburg was re-elected in the [[1932 German presidential election|German presidential election of 1932]].{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=247\u2013283}}\n\nThe Nazi Party was the largest party in the national elections of 1932. On 31 July 1932 it received 37.3% of the votes, and in the election on 6 November 1932 it received less, but still the largest share, 33.1%, making it the biggest party in the ''Reichstag''. The Communist KPD came third, with 15%.<ref>Richard F. Hamilton, '' Who Voted for Hitler?'' (1982)</ref> Together, the anti-democratic parties of the far right were now able to hold a considerable share of seats in Parliament, but they were at sword's point with the political left, fighting it out in the streets. The Nazis were particularly successful among Protestants, among unemployed young voters, among the lower middle class in the cities and among the rural population. It was weakest in Catholic areas and in large cities. On 30 January 1933, pressured by former Chancellor [[Franz von Papen]] and other conservatives, President Hindenburg appointed Hitler as Chancellor.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=283\u2013308}}\n\n===Science and culture in 19th and 20th century===\n{{Main|Science and technology in Germany}}\nThe Weimar years saw a flowering of [[German science]] and high culture, before the Nazi regime resulted in a decline in the scientific and cultural life in Germany and forced many renowned scientists and writers to flee.\nGerman recipients dominated the [[Nobel laureates by country|Nobel prizes in science]].<ref>{{cite web | url= http://nobelprize.org/ | title = Nobel Prize | publisher= Nobelprize.org |accessdate=19 November 2009}}</ref> Germany dominated the world of physics before 1933, led by [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], [[Wilhelm Conrad R\u00f6ntgen]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Otto Hahn]], [[Max Planck]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]].

The decree allowed the police to detain people indefinitely without charges or a court order. Four thousand members of the [[Communist Party of Germany]] were arrested.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=329\u2013334}} Communist agitation was banned, but at this time not the Communist Party itself. Communists and Socialists were brought into hastily prepared [[Nazi concentration camp]]s such as [[Kemna concentration camp]], where they were at the mercy of the [[Gestapo]], the newly established secret police force. Communist ''Reichstag'' deputies were taken into [[protective custody]] (despite their constitutional privileges).\n\n[[File:WWII, Europe, Germany, \"Nazi Hierarchy, Hitler, Goering, Goebbels, Hess\", The Desperate Years p143 - NARA - 196509.jpg|thumb|Some of the leaders of the Nazi regime (left to right): [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], [[Joseph Goebbels]] and [[Rudolf Hess]]]]\nDespite the terror and unprecedented propaganda, the last free General Elections of 5 March 1933, while resulting in 43.9% failed to gave the majority for the NSDAP as Hitler had hoped. Together with the [[German National People's Party]] (DNVP), however, he was able to form a slim majority government. In March 1933, the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]], an amendment to the [[Weimar Constitution]], passed in the Reichstag by a vote of 444 to 94.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=354}} To obtain the two-thirds majority needed to pass the bill, accommodations were made to the Catholic [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], and the Nazis used the provisions of the Reichstag Fire Decree to keep several Social Democratic deputies from attending, and the Communists deputies had already been banned.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=336}} This amendment allowed Hitler and his cabinet to pass laws\u2014even laws that violated the constitution\u2014without the consent of the president or the Reichstag.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=351}} The Enabling Act formed the basis for the dictatorship, dissolution of the [[States of Germany|L\u00e4nder]]; the trade unions and all political parties other than the Nazi Party were suppressed. A centralised totalitarian state was established, no longer based on the liberal [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] constitution. Germany left the [[League of Nations]]. The coalition parliament was rigged by defining the absence of arrested and murdered deputies as voluntary and therefore cause for their exclusion as wilful absentees. Subsequently, in July the Centre Party was voluntarily dissolved in a ''quid pro quo'' with the [[Holy See|Pope]] under the ''anti-communist'' [[Pope Pius XI]] for the ''[[Reichskonkordat]]''; and by these manoeuvres Hitler achieved movement of these Catholic voters into the Nazi Party, and a long-awaited international diplomatic acceptance of his regime. According to Professor Dick Geary the Nazis gained a larger share of their vote in Protestant areas than in Catholic areas, in the elections held between 1928 and November 1932.<ref>{{cite journal | first=Dick | last=Geary | title=Who voted for the Nazis?

In response, Hitler used the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] and Gestapo to purge the entire SA leadership\u2014along with a number of Hitler's political adversaries (such as [[Gregor Strasser]] and former chancellor [[Kurt von Schleicher]]). It became known as the [[Night of the Long Knives]] and took place from 30 June to 2 July 1934.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=309\u2013314}} As a reward, the SS became an independent organisation under the command of the ''[[Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS]]'' Heinrich Himmler. He would rise to become Chief of German Police in June 1936 and already had control over the concentration camps system. Upon Hindenburg's death on 2 August 1934, Hitler's cabinet passed a law proclaiming the presidency to be vacant and transferred the role and powers of the head of state to Hitler as Chancellor and F\u00fchrer (Leader).\n\n===Antisemitism and the Holocaust===\n{{main|History of the Jews in Germany#Jews under the Nazis (1933\u201345)|The Holocaust}}\n[[File:Buchenwald-bei-Weimar-am-24-April-1945.jpg|thumb|U.S. Senator [[Alben W.

When opponents tried to appease him, he accepted the gains that were offered, then went to the next target. That aggressive strategy worked as Germany pulled out of the [[League of Nations]] (1933), rejected the [[Versailles Treaty]] and began to re-arm (1935), won back the Saar (1935), remilitarized the Rhineland (1936), formed an alliance (\"axis\") with Mussolini's Italy (1936), sent massive military aid to Franco in the Spanish Civil War (1936\u201339), annexed Austria (1938), took over Czechoslovakia after the British and French ''appeasement'' of the Munich Agreement of 1938, formed a peace pact with [[Joseph Stalin]]'s Soviet Union in August 1939, and finally invaded Poland on 1 September 1939.

On 12 March 1938, German troops marched into Austria, where an attempted Nazi coup had been unsuccessful in 1934. When Austrian-born Hitler entered [[Vienna]], he was greeted by loud cheers. Four weeks later, 99% of Austrians voted in favour of the annexation ([[Anschluss]]) of their country Austria to the [[German Reich]]. After Austria, Hitler turned to [[Czechoslovakia]], where the 3.5&nbsp;million-strong [[Sudeten German]] minority was demanding equal rights and self-government. At the [[Munich Agreement|Munich Conference]] of September 1938, Hitler, the Italian leader Benito Mussolini, British Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] and French Prime Minister [[\u00c9douard Daladier]] agreed upon the cession of Sudeten territory to the German Reich by [[Czechoslovakia]]. Hitler thereupon declared that all of German Reich's territorial claims had been fulfilled. However, hardly six months after the Munich Agreement, in March 1939, Hitler used the smoldering quarrel between [[Slovak people|Slovaks]] and [[Czechs]] as a pretext for taking over the rest of Czechoslovakia as the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]]. In the same month, he secured the return of [[Klaip\u0117da Region|Memel]] from [[Lithuania]] to Germany.

That meant that people had accumulated large paper assets, and that official prices and wages did not reflect reality, as the black market dominated the economy and more than half of all transactions were taking place unofficially. On 21 June 1948, the Western Allies withdrew the old currency and replaced it with the new [[Deutsche Mark]] at the rate of 1 new per 10 old. This wiped out 90% of government and private debt, as well as private savings. Prices were decontrolled, and labor unions agreed to accept a 15% wage increase, despite the 25% rise in prices. The result was that prices of German export products held steady, while profits and earnings from exports soared and were poured back into the economy. The currency reforms were simultaneous with the $1.4 billion in [[Marshall Plan]] money coming in from the United States, which was used primarily for investment.\n\nIn addition, the Marshall Plan forced German companies, as well as those in all of Western Europe, to modernize their business practices and take account of the international market. Marshall Plan funding helped overcome bottlenecks in the surging economy caused by remaining controls (which were removed in 1949), and Marshall Plan business reforms opened up a greatly expanded market for German exports. Overnight, consumer goods appeared in the stores, because they could be sold for realistic prices, emphasizing to Germans that their economy had turned a corner.<ref name=tipton />\n\nThe success of the currency reform angered the Soviets, who cut off all road, rail, and canal links between the western zones and [[West Berlin]]. This was the [[Berlin Blockade]], which lasted from 24 June 1948 to 12 May 1949. In response, the U.S. and Britain launched an airlift of food and coal and distributed the new currency in West Berlin as well.

Agenda 2010 had five goals: tax cuts; labor market deregulation, especially relaxing rules protecting workers from dismissal and setting up [[Hartz concept]] job training; modernizing the welfare state by reducing entitlements; decreasing bureaucratic obstacles for small businesses; and providing new low-interest loans to local governments.<ref>{{cite book | first=Paul |last=Hockenos |title=Joschka Fischer and the making of the Berlin Republic | year=2008 | pages=313\u201314}}</ref>\n\nOn 26 December 2004 during a [[Christmas Day|Christmas holiday]] and [[Boxing Day]] celebration, a several thousands of [[Germans]] in [[Thailand]] and the other part across the region of [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]] were [[Countries affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|affected by the catastrophic tsunami]] from the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|magnitude 9.0 earthquake]] off the [[Indonesia]]n island's west coast of [[Sumatra]], and many thousands are lost of German lives. A memorial service held at [[Berlin Cathedral]] and [[Bundestag]] on 20 January 2005. On behalf of all [[Germans]].\n\nOn 22 May 2005, after the SPD lost to the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU) in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]] announced he would call federal elections \"as soon as possible\". A [[motion of confidence]] was subsequently defeated in the [[Bundestag]] on 1 July 2005 by 151 to 296 (with 148 abstaining), after Schr\u00f6der urged members not to vote for his government in order to trigger new elections. In response, a grouping of left-wing SPD dissidents and the neo-communist [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism]] agreed to run on a joint ticket in the general election, with Schr\u00f6der's rival [[Oskar Lafontaine]] leading the new group.\n\n===Merkel===\nFrom 2005 to 2009, Germany was ruled by a [[grand coalition]] led by the CDU's [[Angela Merkel]] as chancellor. Since the [[2009 German federal election|2009 elections]], Merkel has headed a centre-right government of the CDU/CSU and FDP.<ref>{{cite book | editor-first=Silvia |editor-last=Bolgherini | editor2-first=Florian |editor2-last=Grotz | title=Germany After the Grand Coalition: Governance and Politics in a Turbulent Environment | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | year=2010}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Angela Merkel und Jos\u00e9 Barroso vor dem Brandenburger Tor.jpg|thumb|upright|left|German chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] with [[Jos\u00e9 Barroso]] in 2007 promoting the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] to reform the EU.]]\n\nTogether with France and other EU states, Germany has played the leading role in the [[European Union]]. Germany (especially under Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]]) was one of the main supporters of admitting many East European countries to the EU. Germany is at the forefront of European states seeking to exploit the momentum of monetary union to advance the creation of a more unified and capable European political, defence and security apparatus. German Chancellor Schr\u00f6der expressed an interest in a permanent seat for Germany in the [[UN Security Council]], identifying France, Russia, and Japan as countries that explicitly backed Germany's bid. Germany formally adopted the Euro on 1 January 1999 after permanently fixing the Deutsche Mark rate on 31 December 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/1998/html/pr981231_2.en.html |title= Determination of the euro conversion rates  | publisher = European Central Bank   |date=31 December 1998    |accessdate= 4 March 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/1999/1099lead.pdf |title= The Launch of the Euro  | publisher = Federal Reserve   |author=Carol C.

Since 2002, German troops formed part of the [[International Security Assistance Force]] in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|war in Afghanistan]], resulting in the first German [[German Armed Forces casualties in Afghanistan|casualties]] in combat missions since World War II.\n\nIn [[Late-2000s recession|the worldwide economic recession]] that began in 2008, Germany did relatively well. However, the economic instability of Greece and several other EU nations in 2010\u201311 forced Germany to reluctantly sponsor a massive financial rescue.\n\nIn the wake of the 2011 natural disaster to the nuclear industry in [[Japan]] following its [[2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami|9.0 magnitude earthquake and tsunami]], German public opinion turned sharply against [[nuclear power in Germany]], which produces a fourth of the electricity supply. In response Merkel has announced plans to close down the nuclear system over the next decade, and to rely even more heavily on wind and other alternative energy sources, in addition to coal and natural gas.<ref>{{cite news | first=Steven |last=Mufson |title=Germany to close all of its nuclear plants by 2022 | newspaper =Washington Post | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/germany-to-close-all-of-its-nuclear-plants-by-2022/2011/05/30/AG0op1EH_story.html | date= 30 May 2011}}</ref> For further information, see [[Germany in 2011]].\n\nGermany was affected by the [[European migrant crisis]] in 2015 as it became the final destination of choice for many asylum seekers from [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]] entering the EU.

Proponents of the ''Sonderweg'' theory such as [[Fritz Fischer]] point to such events of the [[Revolution of 1848]], the [[authoritarianism]] of the Second Empire and the continuation of the Imperial elite into the Weimar and Nazi periods. Opponents such as [[Gerhard Ritter]] of the ''Sonderweg'' theory argue that proponents of the theory are guilty of seeking selective examples, and there was much contingency and chance in German history. In addition, there was much debate within the supporters of the ''Sonderweg'' concept as for the reasons for the ''Sonderweg'', and whether or not the ''Sonderweg'' ended in 1945. Was there a Sonderweg? Winkler says:\n:\"For a long time, educated Germans answered it in the positive, initially by laying claim to a special German mission, then, after the collapse of 1945, by criticizing Germany's deviation from the West. Today, the negative view is predominant. Germany did not, according to the now prevailing opinion, differ from the great European nations to an extent that would justify speaking of a 'unique German path.' And, in any case, no country on earth ever took what can be described as the 'normal path.'\"<ref>Heinrich August Winkler, ''Germany: The Long Road West'' (2006), vol 1 p 1</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Germany}}\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Conservatism in Germany]]\n* [[Economic history of Germany]]\n* [[Feminism in Germany]]\n* [[Family tree of the German monarchs|German monarchs Family tree]]\n* [[History of Austria]]\n* [[History of Berlin]]\n* [[History of German foreign policy]]\n* [[History of German journalism]]\n* [[History of German women]]\n* [[History of the Jews in Germany]]\n* [[Liberalism in Germany]]\n* [[List of Chancellors of Germany]]\n* [[List of German monarchs]]\n* Medieval [[Ostsiedlung|East Colonisation]] by German noblemen and farmers\n* [[Military history of Germany]]\n* [[Names of Germany]] for terminology applied to Germany\n* [[Politics of Germany]]\n* [[Territorial evolution of Germany]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n===Footnotes===\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|last=Barraclough|first=Geoffrey|title=The Origins of Modern Germany?|year=1984|ref={{sfnref|Barraclough|1984}}}}\n* {{cite book | last = Beevor | first = Antony | title = The Second World War | year = 2012 | publisher = Little, Brown | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-316-02374-0 | ref = harv| title-link = The Second World War (book) }}\n* {{cite book|last=Bradbury|first=Jim|author-link=Jim Bradbury|title=The Routledge Companion to Medieval Warfare|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3FRsBgAAQBAJ|series=Routledge Companions to History|publisher=[[Routledge Press|Routledge]]|date=2004|isbn=9781134598472|ref={{sfnref|Bradbury|2004}}}}\n* {{cite book|last=Bowman|first=Alan K.|first2=Peter|last2=Garnsey|first3=Averil|last3=Cameron|title=The Crisis of Empire, A.D. 193\u2013337|series=The Cambridge Ancient History|volume=12|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-521-30199-2|ref={{sfnref|Bowman|2005}}}}\n* {{cite book|last=Carr|first=William| authorlink = William Carr (historian) |title=A History of Germany: 1815-1990|date=1991|edition=4|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-340-55930-7|ref={{sfnref|Carr|1991}}}}\n* {{cite book|last=Carsten|first=Francis|title=The Origins of Prussia|year=1958|ref={{sfnref|Carsten|1958}}}}\n* {{cite book|last=Claster|first=Jill N.|title=Medieval Experience: 300\u20131400|publisher=[[New York University Press]]|year=1982|isbn=978-0-8147-1381-5|ref={{sfnref|Claster|1982}}|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_g6n9}}\n* {{cite book|last=Damminger|first=Folke|chapter=Dwellings, Settlements and Settlement Patterns in Merovingian Southwest Germany and adjacent areas|editor-last=Wood|editor-first=Ian|editor-link=Ian S.

The four semifinalists ([[Cuba national football team|Cuba]], [[Guadeloupe national football team|Guadeloupe]], [[Haiti national football team|Haiti]], and hosts [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]]) qualified for the [[2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup|2007]] edition of the [[CONCACAF Gold Cup]]. In all, 24 of the eligible countries participated (5 did not enter and 1 withdrew).\n\n[[Haiti national football team|Haiti]] eventually won the tournament despite having to qualify for the finals through a play-off of third-place teams from the second round and finishing second in its final-round group. Haiti beat eight-time champion and host Trinidad and Tobago in the final, although Trinidad and Tobago was missing overseas players that had helped them qualify for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]. [[Guadeloupe national football team|Guadeloupe]] were the surprise of the tournament, as former French international [[Jocelyn Angloma]] came out of retirement to help the team advance to the semifinals, qualifying for its first Gold Cup in the process.

Guyana surprised many by dominating Group A, and Surinam qualified for the second round as well. Group host Netherlands Antilles finished last by capturing a lone draw. Group B did not go to form, either; though Barbados fulfilled widely held expectations by winning, host Antigua & Barbuda produced a minor shock by also making it out of the group at the expense of St. Kitts & Nevis. St. Kitts had a late penalty kick to be taken by [[Atiba Harris]] that if made would have eliminated Antigua & Barbuda in the group's final game, but the Antiguan goalkeeper saved the penalty. Group C went to form, save only that the British Virgin Islands withdrew before group play started. Bermuda expectedly dominated the group. The shocker of the round, though occurred in Group D, where host Jamaica, widely considered the best national footballing side in the Caribbean, did not advance to the second round. Jamaica lost their second game to St. Vincent & Grenadines 2\u20131. Playing in the final game on the group's last day knowing they had to defeat Haiti by 3 goals to qualify, Jamaica could only muster a 2\u20130 victory, meaning that St. Vincent & Grenadines pulled the upset and advanced to the second round based on goals scored. Despite their loss to Jamaica, Haiti won the group based on goal differential. Host Cuba won Group E, with the Bahamas advancing as well by defeating a surprisingly competitive Turks & Caicos team. In Group F, the French departments of Martinique and host Guadeloupe carried on easily, with the host winning the group.\n\n===Group A===\nPlayed in [[Netherlands Antilles]] at [[Stadion Ergilio Hato]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=165|Team\n!width=20|Pld\n!width=20|W\n!width=20|D\n!width=20|L\n!width=20|GF\n!width=20|GA\n!width=20|GD\n!width=20|Pts\n|- align=center style=\"background:#ccffcc;\"\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{fb|GUY}}\n|3||3||0||0||11||0||+11||'''9'''\n|- align=center style=\"background:#ccffcc;\"\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{fb|SUR}}\n|3||2||0||1||2||5||\u22123||'''6'''\n|- align=center style=\"background:#f5f5f5;\"\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{fb|GRN}}\n|3||0||1||2||1||3||\u22122||'''1'''\n|- align=center style=\"background:#f5f5f5;\"\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{fb|ANT}}\n|3||0||1||2||1||7||\u22126||'''1'''\n|}\n\n{{footballbox|date = 6 September 2006|team1 = {{fb-rt|SUR}}|score = 0\u20135|report= |team2 = {{fb|GUY}}|goals1 = |goals2 =[[Gregory Richardson|Richardson]] {{goal|4}}<br />[[Nigel Codrington|Codrington]] {{goal|15||73}}<br /> [[Randolph Jerome|Jerome]] {{goal|42}}<br />[[Anthony Abrams|Abrams]] {{goal|90}}|stadium = [[Stadion Ergilio Hato]], [[Willemstad]] | referee = Rudolph Angela ([[Aruba]])\n}}\n{{footballbox|date = 6 September 2006|team1 = {{fb-rt|ANT}}|score = 1\u20131|report= |team2 = {{fb|GRN}}|goals1 = [[Tyrone Maria|Maria]] {{goal|1}}|goals2 =[[Dennis Rennie|Rennie]] {{goal|52}}|stadium = [[Stadion Ergilio Hato]], [[Willemstad]] | referee = Willy Minyetty<br />([[Dominican Republic]])\n}}\n----\n{{footballbox|date = 8 September 2006|team1 = {{fb-rt|SUR}}|score = 1\u20130|report= |team2 = {{fb|GRN}}|goals1 = [[Gorden Kinsaine|Kinsaine]] {{goal|35}}|goals2 = |stadium = [[Stadion Ergilio Hato]], [[Willemstad]] | referee = Lee Davis<br> ([[Trinidad & Tobago]])\n}}\n{{footballbox|date = 8 September 2006|team1 = {{fb-rt|ANT}}|score = 0\u20135|report= |team2 = {{fb|GUY}}|goals1 = |goals2 = [[Nigel Codrington|Codrington]] {{goal|35||58}}<br />[[Shawn Bishop|Bishop]] {{goal|64}}<br />[[Anthony Abrams|Abrams]] {{goal|84}}<br />[[Randolph Jerome|Jerome]] {{goal|89}}|stadium = [[Stadion Ergilio Hato]], [[Willemstad]] | referee = Felix Suazo<br />([[Dominican Republic]])\n}}\n\n----\n{{footballbox|date = 10 September 2006|team1 = {{fb-rt|GRN}}|score = 0\u20131|report= |team2 = {{fb|GUY}}|goals1 = |goals2 = [[Shawn Bishop|Bishop]] {{goal|46}} |stadium = [[Stadion Ergilio Hato]], [[Willemstad]] | referee = Rudolph Angela ([[Aruba]])\n}}\n{{footballbox|date = 10 September 2006|team1 = {{fb-rt|ANT}}|score = 0\u20131|report= |team2 = {{fb|SUR}}|goals1 = |goals2 = [[Orlando Grootfaam|Grootfaam]] {{goal|4}} |stadium = [[Stadion Ergilio Hato]], [[Willemstad]]| referee = Felix Suazo<br />([[Dominican Republic]])}}\n\n===Group B===\nPlayed in [[Antigua and Barbuda]] at [[Antigua Recreation Ground]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=165|Team\n!width=20|Pld\n!width=20|W\n!width=20|D\n!width=20|L\n!width=20|GF\n!width=20|GA\n!width=20|GD\n!width=20|Pts\n|- align=center style=\"background:#ccffcc;\"\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{fb|BRB}}\n|3||2||1||0||11||3||+8||'''7'''\n|- align=center style=\"background:#ccffcc;\"\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{fb|ATG}}\n|3||2||0||1||7||6||+1||'''6'''\n|- align=center style=\"background:#f5f5f5;\"\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{fb|SKN}}\n|3||1||1||1||7||3||+4||'''4'''\n|- align=center style=\"background:#f5f5f5;\"\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{fb|AIA}}\n|3||0||0||3||5||18||\u221213||'''0'''\n|}\n\n{{footballbox\n|date = 20 September 2006\n|team1 = {{fb-rt|BRB}}\n|score = 1\u20131| report=\n|team2 = {{fb|SKN}}\n|goals1 = [[Paul Ifill|Ifill]] {{goal|42}}\n|goals2 = [[Atiba Harris|Harris]] {{goal|60}}\n|stadium = [[Antigua Recreation Ground]], [[St. John's, Antigua and Barbuda|St. Johns]]\n|attendance = 300| referee = Courtney Campbell ([[Jamaica]])\n}}\n{{footballbox\n|date = 20 September 2006\n|team1 = {{fb-rt|ATG}}\n|score = 5\u20133| report=\n|team2 = {{fb|AIA}}\n|goals1 = [[Peter Byers|Byers]] {{goal|8|pen.|16||71|pen.}}<br />[[Tamarley Thomas|T.

two teams from each first-stage group qualified for the second stage of the competition. Those teams were split into three groups of four teams, called Groups G, H and I. The top two teams in each of these three groups qualified for the finals with {{fb|TRI}}, making seven teams. The best third-place team from Groups G, H, and I qualified as the eighth team in the final competition. This was to have been determined by a single round-robin playoff between the three teams, to be called Group J; however, when Dominican Republic withdrew, the remaining two teams played a two-game series for the right to move on.\n\n===Summary===\nAll three groups went largely to form. It was a wonderful round for host teams, with all three advancing and two winning their group.  Host Barbados advanced easily out of Group G, only a tie with Bermuda marring their group performance.  They were accompanied by St. Vincent and the Grenadines.  Guyana proved perfect as hosts of Group H, and Guadeloupe also did well enough to advance.  Finally, Cuba and host Martinique smashed the other two teams in Group I to move forward, with Cuba winning the group based on goal differential.  The third-place teams (Bermuda, Dominican Republic, and Haiti) were to have been drawn together in Group J.  However, Dominican Republic withdrew, leaving Bermuda and Haiti to contest a two-game set.  After achieving a 2\u20130 win in the first match, Haiti were overwhelming favourites in the second match.  With Haiti leading by two goals in stoppage time of the second half, a thrilling goal by \u00c9liph\u00e8ne Cadet (to add to his goal in the first match) gave Haiti a 3\u20130 victory, a 5\u20130 aggregate win, and with it the final spot in the final stage.\n\n===Group G===\nPlayed in [[Barbados]] at [[Barbados National Stadium]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=245|Team\n!width=20|Pld\n!width=20|W\n!width=20|D\n!width=20|L\n!width=20|GF\n!width=20|GA\n!width=20|GD\n!width=20|Pts\n|- align=center style=\"background:#ccffcc;\"\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{fb|BRB}}\n|3||2||1||0||6||2||+4||'''7'''\n|- align=center style=\"background:#ccffcc;\"\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{fb|VIN}}\n|3||2||0||1||6||5||+1||'''6'''\n|- align=center style=\"background:#ffffcc;\"\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{fb|BER}}\n|3||1||1||1||5||4||+1||'''4'''\n|- align=center style=\"background:\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{fb|BAH}}\n|3||0||0||3||3||9||\u22126||'''0'''\n|}\n\n{{footballbox\n|date = 19 November 2006\n|team1 = {{fb-rt|BER}}\n|score = 0\u20133 | report=\n|team2 = {{fb|VIN}}\n|goals1 =\n|goals2 = [[Marlon James (footballer)|M.

the biennial [[Caribbean Cup]], the finals of which were contested in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] between 12 January and 23 January 2007. The four semifinalists ([[Cuba national football team|Cuba]], [[Guadeloupe national football team|Guadeloupe]], [[Haiti national football team|Haiti]], and hosts [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]]) qualified for the [[2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup|2007]] edition of the [[CONCACAF Gold Cup]]. In all, 24 of the eligible countries participated (5 did not enter and 1 withdrew).\n\n[[Haiti national football team|Haiti]] eventually won the tournament despite having to qualify for the finals through a play-off of third-place teams from the second round and finishing second in its final-round group. Haiti beat eight-time champion and host Trinidad and Tobago in the final, although Trinidad and Tobago was missing overseas players that had helped them qualify for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]. [[Guadeloupe national football team|Guadeloupe]] were the surprise of the tournament, as former French international [[Jocelyn Angloma]] came out of retirement to help the team advance to the semifinals, qualifying for its first Gold Cup in the process. [[Cuba national football team|Cuba]] continued its development in the region by finishing in third place.\n\n==Prize money==\n* {{fb|HAI}}, as the '''winner''', received US$120,000 (UK \u00a364,022).\n* {{fb|TRI}}, as the '''runner up''', received US$70,000 (UK \u00a337,350).\n* {{fb|CUB}}, as the '''third-place team''', received US$50,000 (UK \u00a326,680).\n* {{fb|GLP|local}}, as the '''fourth-place team''', received US$30,000 (UK \u00a316,009).\n* Each of the ten host countries received a subsistence package of US$20,000 (UK \u00a310,673).  Additionally, the '''host''' of the '''Digicel Caribbean Cup Final''' received US$150,000 (UK \u00a380,047) to compensate for the increased costs of holding the final round of the competition.\n\n(UK \u00a3 values calculated on 28 September 2006)\n\n==First Qualifying Round==\n{{fb|TRI}} receive bye to final round. {{fb|ARU}}, {{fb|GYF|local}}, {{fb|MSR}}, {{fb|PUR}} and {{fb|Sint Maarten}} did not enter.\n\n===Summary===\nThe first round produced some notable upsets. Guyana surprised many by dominating Group A, and Surinam qualified for the second round as well. Group host Netherlands Antilles finished last by capturing a lone draw. Group B did not go to form, either; though Barbados fulfilled widely held expectations by winning, host Antigua & Barbuda produced a minor shock by also making it out of the group at the expense of St. Kitts & Nevis. St. Kitts had a late penalty kick to be taken by [[Atiba Harris]] that if made would have eliminated Antigua & Barbuda in the group's final game, but the Antiguan goalkeeper saved the penalty. Group C went to form, save only that the British Virgin Islands withdrew before group play started. Bermuda expectedly dominated the group. The shocker of the round, though occurred in Group D, where host Jamaica, widely considered the best national footballing side in the Caribbean, did not advance to the second round. Jamaica lost their second game to St. Vincent & Grenadines 2\u20131. Playing in the final game on the group's last day knowing they had to defeat Haiti by 3 goals to qualify, Jamaica could only muster a 2\u20130 victory, meaning that St. Vincent & Grenadines pulled the upset and advanced to the second round based on goals scored. Despite their loss to Jamaica, Haiti won the group based on goal differential. Host Cuba won Group E, with the Bahamas advancing as well by defeating a surprisingly competitive Turks & Caicos team. In Group F, the French departments of Martinique and host Guadeloupe carried on easily, with the host winning the group.\n\n===Group A===\nPlayed in [[Netherlands Antilles]] at [[Stadion Ergilio Hato]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=165|Team\n!width=20|Pld\n!width=20|W\n!width=20|D\n!width=20|L\n!width=20|GF\n!width=20|GA\n!width=20|GD\n!width=20|Pts\n|- align=center style=\"background:#ccffcc;\"\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{fb|GUY}}\n|3||3||0||0||11||0||+11||'''9'''\n|- align=center style=\"background:#ccffcc;\"\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{fb|SUR}}\n|3||2||0||1||2||5||\u22123||'''6'''\n|- align=center style=\"background:#f5f5f5;\"\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{fb|GRN}}\n|3||0||1||2||1||3||\u22122||'''1'''\n|- align=center style=\"background:#f5f5f5;\"\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{fb|ANT}}\n|3||0||1||2||1||7||\u22126||'''1'''\n|}\n\n{{footballbox|date = 6 September 2006|team1 = {{fb-rt|SUR}}|score = 0\u20135|report= |team2 = {{fb|GUY}}|goals1 = |goals2 =[[Gregory Richardson|Richardson]] {{goal|4}}<br />[[Nigel Codrington|Codrington]] {{goal|15||73}}<br /> [[Randolph Jerome|Jerome]] {{goal|42}}<br />[[Anthony Abrams|Abrams]] {{goal|90}}|stadium = [[Stadion Ergilio Hato]], [[Willemstad]] | referee = Rudolph Angela ([[Aruba]])\n}}\n{{footballbox|date = 6 September 2006|team1 = {{fb-rt|ANT}}|score = 1\u20131|report= |team2 = {{fb|GRN}}|goals1 = [[Tyrone Maria|Maria]] {{goal|1}}|goals2 =[[Dennis Rennie|Rennie]] {{goal|52}}|stadium = [[Stadion Ergilio Hato]], [[Willemstad]] | referee = Willy Minyetty<br />([[Dominican Republic]])\n}}\n----\n{{footballbox|date = 8 September 2006|team1 = {{fb-rt|SUR}}|score = 1\u20130|report= |team2 = {{fb|GRN}}|goals1 = [[Gorden Kinsaine|Kinsaine]] {{goal|35}}|goals2 = |stadium = [[Stadion Ergilio Hato]], [[Willemstad]] | referee = Lee Davis<br> ([[Trinidad & Tobago]])\n}}\n{{footballbox|date = 8 September 2006|team1 = {{fb-rt|ANT}}|score = 0\u20135|report= |team2 = {{fb|GUY}}|goals1 = |goals2 = [[Nigel Codrington|Codrington]] {{goal|35||58}}<br />[[Shawn Bishop|Bishop]] {{goal|64}}<br />[[Anthony Abrams|Abrams]] {{goal|84}}<br />[[Randolph Jerome|Jerome]] {{goal|89}}|stadium = [[Stadion Ergilio Hato]], [[Willemstad]] | referee = Felix Suazo<br />([[Dominican Republic]])\n}}\n\n----\n{{footballbox|date = 10 September 2006|team1 = {{fb-rt|GRN}}|score = 0\u20131|report= |team2 = {{fb|GUY}}|goals1 = |goals2 = [[Shawn Bishop|Bishop]] {{goal|46}} |stadium = [[Stadion Ergilio Hato]], [[Willemstad]] | referee = Rudolph Angela ([[Aruba]])\n}}\n{{footballbox|date = 10 September 2006|team1 = {{fb-rt|ANT}}|score = 0\u20131|report= |team2 = {{fb|SUR}}|goals1 = |goals2 = [[Orlando Grootfaam|Grootfaam]] {{goal|4}} |stadium = [[Stadion Ergilio Hato]], [[Willemstad]]| referee = Felix Suazo<br />([[Dominican Republic]])}}\n\n===Group B===\nPlayed in [[Antigua and Barbuda]] at [[Antigua Recreation Ground]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=165|Team\n!width=20|Pld\n!width=20|W\n!width=20|D\n!width=20|L\n!width=20|GF\n!width=20|GA\n!width=20|GD\n!width=20|Pts\n|- align=center style=\"background:#ccffcc;\"\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{fb|BRB}}\n|3||2||1||0||11||3||+8||'''7'''\n|- align=center style=\"background:#ccffcc;\"\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{fb|ATG}}\n|3||2||0||1||7||6||+1||'''6'''\n|- align=center style=\"background:#f5f5f5;\"\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{fb|SKN}}\n|3||1||1||1||7||3||+4||'''4'''\n|- align=center style=\"background:#f5f5f5;\"\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{fb|AIA}}\n|3||0||0||3||5||18||\u221213||'''0'''\n|}\n\n{{footballbox\n|date = 20 September 2006\n|team1 = {{fb-rt|BRB}}\n|score = 1\u20131| report=\n|team2 = {{fb|SKN}}\n|goals1 = [[Paul Ifill|Ifill]] {{goal|42}}\n|goals2 = [[Atiba Harris|Harris]] {{goal|60}}\n|stadium = [[Antigua Recreation Ground]], [[St. John's, Antigua and Barbuda|St. Johns]]\n|attendance = 300| referee = Courtney Campbell ([[Jamaica]])\n}}\n{{footballbox\n|date = 20 September 2006\n|team1 = {{fb-rt|ATG}}\n|score = 5\u20133| report=\n|team2 = {{fb|AIA}}\n|goals1 = [[Peter Byers|Byers]] {{goal|8|pen.|16||71|pen.}}<br />[[Tamarley Thomas|T.

two teams from each first-stage group qualified for the second stage of the competition. Those teams were split into three groups of four teams, called Groups G, H and I. The top two teams in each of these three groups qualified for the finals with {{fb|TRI}}, making seven teams. The best third-place team from Groups G, H, and I qualified as the eighth team in the final competition. This was to have been determined by a single round-robin playoff between the three teams, to be called Group J; however, when Dominican Republic withdrew, the remaining two teams played a two-game series for the right to move on.\n\n===Summary===\nAll three groups went largely to form. It was a wonderful round for host teams, with all three advancing and two winning their group.  Host Barbados advanced easily out of Group G, only a tie with Bermuda marring their group performance.  They were accompanied by St. Vincent and the Grenadines.  Guyana proved perfect as hosts of Group H, and Guadeloupe also did well enough to advance.  Finally, Cuba and host Martinique smashed the other two teams in Group I to move forward, with Cuba winning the group based on goal differential.  The third-place teams (Bermuda, Dominican Republic, and Haiti) were to have been drawn together in Group J.  However, Dominican Republic withdrew, leaving Bermuda and Haiti to contest a two-game set.  After achieving a 2\u20130 win in the first match, Haiti were overwhelming favourites in the second match.  With Haiti leading by two goals in stoppage time of the second half, a thrilling goal by \u00c9liph\u00e8ne Cadet (to add to his goal in the first match) gave Haiti a 3\u20130 victory, a 5\u20130 aggregate win, and with it the final spot in the final stage.\n\n===Group G===\nPlayed in [[Barbados]] at [[Barbados National Stadium]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=245|Team\n!width=20|Pld\n!width=20|W\n!width=20|D\n!width=20|L\n!width=20|GF\n!width=20|GA\n!width=20|GD\n!width=20|Pts\n|- align=center style=\"background:#ccffcc;\"\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{fb|BRB}}\n|3||2||1||0||6||2||+4||'''7'''\n|- align=center style=\"background:#ccffcc;\"\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{fb|VIN}}\n|3||2||0||1||6||5||+1||'''6'''\n|- align=center style=\"background:#ffffcc;\"\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{fb|BER}}\n|3||1||1||1||5||4||+1||'''4'''\n|- align=center style=\"background:\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{fb|BAH}}\n|3||0||0||3||3||9||\u22126||'''0'''\n|}\n\n{{footballbox\n|date = 19 November 2006\n|team1 = {{fb-rt|BER}}\n|score = 0\u20133 | report=\n|team2 = {{fb|VIN}}\n|goals1 =\n|goals2 = [[Marlon James (footballer)|M.

The championship was originally created by the Mexican promotion [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL) in 1946. The promotion had control of the championship from 1946 until 1996 and again from 2007 until 2010. From 1996 until 2007 the championship was promoted mainly in Japan, first as one of eight championships that made up the [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] (NJPW) [[J-Crown|J-Crown Championship]]. After the J-Crown was discontinued the title remained in Japan being promoted by the [[Toryumon (\u00daltimo Drag\u00f3n)|Toryumon]] promotion up until 2007 when it returned to Mexico and CMLL. CMLL was a member of the National Wrestling Alliance up until the late 1980s but chose to keep the championship and the NWA prefix after leaving the NWA. \n\nThe championship predates the creation of the National Wrestling Alliance in 1948 and was initially known simply as the \"World Welterweight Championship\", promoted by [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre|Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre]] (EMLL). When EMLL joined the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] in 1952, the title was given the NWA prefix.<ref name=NWAEMLL>{{cite book|author=Hornbaker, Tim|title= National Wrestling Alliance: the untold story of the monopoly that strangled pro wrestling|publisher=ECW Press|year=2007|chapter=International Expansion|pages=24\u201325|isbn=978-1-55022-741-3}}</ref> In the late 1980s, EMLL withdrew from the NWA and changed its name to Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL).<ref>{{cite book|author=Madigan, Dan|title=Mondo Lucha a Go-Go: the bizarre & honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling|publisher=HarperColins Publisher|year=2007|chapter=The start of the journey|pages=15\u201328|isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}</ref> CMLL retained ownership of three NWA-branded championships which originated in the promotion.{{efn|name=NWAWelterweight}} The other two were the [[NWA World Middleweight Championship]] and the [[NWA World Light Heavyweight Championship]].

The championship would switch hands in each round of the tournament as [[\u00daltimo Drag\u00f3n]] won it the next night and then [[Great Sasuke]], who won the tournament. In 1996 and 1997 the championship was defended as part of the J-Crown until the J-Crown was broken up into the original individual championships, after which it was once again inactive until early 1999 when Dragon Kid became the first Toryumon-promoted champion. From 1999 until 2007 the championship was promoted exclusively by Toryumon, mainly in Japan and occasionally in Torymon's Mexican branch.

The championship was originally created by the Mexican promotion [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL) in 1946. The promotion had control of the championship from 1946 until 1996 and again from 2007 until 2010. From 1996 until 2007 the championship was promoted mainly in Japan, first as one of eight championships that made up the [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] (NJPW) [[J-Crown|J-Crown Championship]]. After the J-Crown was discontinued the title remained in Japan being promoted by the [[Toryumon (\u00daltimo Drag\u00f3n)|Toryumon]] promotion up until 2007 when it returned to Mexico and CMLL. CMLL was a member of the National Wrestling Alliance up until the late 1980s but chose to keep the championship and the NWA prefix after leaving the NWA. \n\nThe championship predates the creation of the National Wrestling Alliance in 1948 and was initially known simply as the \"World Welterweight Championship\", promoted by [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre|Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre]] (EMLL). When EMLL joined the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] in 1952, the title was given the NWA prefix.<ref name=NWAEMLL>{{cite book|author=Hornbaker, Tim|title= National Wrestling Alliance: the untold story of the monopoly that strangled pro wrestling|publisher=ECW Press|year=2007|chapter=International Expansion|pages=24\u201325|isbn=978-1-55022-741-3}}</ref> In the late 1980s, EMLL withdrew from the NWA and changed its name to Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL).<ref>{{cite book|author=Madigan, Dan|title=Mondo Lucha a Go-Go: the bizarre & honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling|publisher=HarperColins Publisher|year=2007|chapter=The start of the journey|pages=15\u201328|isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}</ref> CMLL retained ownership of three NWA-branded championships which originated in the promotion.{{efn|name=NWAWelterweight}} The other two were the [[NWA World Middleweight Championship]] and the [[NWA World Light Heavyweight Championship]].

From 1999 until 2007 the championship was promoted exclusively by Toryumon, mainly in Japan and occasionally in Torymon's Mexican branch.
