These conflicts occurred in North America from the time of the earliest colonial settlements in the 17th century until the early 20th century. The various wars resulted from a wide variety of factors, including cultural clashes, land disputes, and criminal acts committed by both sides. The European powers and their colonies also enlisted Indian tribes to help them conduct warfare against each other's colonial settlements.\n\nAfter the [[American Revolution]], many conflicts were local to specific states or regions and frequently involved disputes over land use; some entailed cycles of violent reprisal. In Canada, 11 [[Numbered Treaties]] covering most of the First Nations lands limited the number of such conflicts.\n\nAs settlers spread westward across America and Canada after 1780, armed conflicts increased in size, duration, and intensity between settlers and various Indian and First Nation tribes. The climax came in the [[War of 1812]], when major Indian coalitions in the Midwest and the South fought against the United States and lost. Conflict with settlers became much less common and was usually resolved by treaty, often through sale or exchange of territory between the federal government and specific tribes. The [[Indian Removal Act]] of 1830 authorized the American government to enforce the Indian removal from east of the Mississippi River to the west on the [[American frontier]], especially Oklahoma. The federal policy of removal was eventually refined in the West, as American settlers kept expanding their territories, to relocate Indian tribes to specially designated and federally protected and subsidized reservations.\n\n==Colonial period (1609\u20131774)==\n{{further|European colonization of the Americas}}\n[[File:1622 massacre jamestown de Bry.jpg|thumb|[[Indian massacre of 1622]]]]\n[[File:Siege of Fort Detroit.jpg|thumb|right|[[Siege of Fort Detroit]] during [[Pontiac's Rebellion]] in 1763]]\nThe colonization of America by the English, French, Spanish, Dutch, and Swedish was resisted by some Indian tribes and assisted by other tribes. Wars and other armed conflicts in the 17th and 18th centuries included:\n* [[Beaver Wars]] (1609\u20131701) between the [[Iroquois]] and the French, who allied with the [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquians]]\n* [[Anglo-Powhatan Wars]] (1610\u201314, 1622\u201332, 1644\u201346), including the [[Indian massacre of 1622|1622 Jamestown Massacre]], between English colonists and the [[Powhatan Confederacy]] in the [[Colony of Virginia]]\n* [[Pequot War]] of 1636\u201338 between the [[Pequot]] tribe and colonists from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and [[Connecticut Colony]] and allied tribes\n* [[Kieft's War]] (1643\u201345) in the Dutch territory of [[New Netherland]] ([[New Jersey]] and [[New York (state)|New York]]) between colonists and the [[Lenape]] people\n* [[Peach Tree War]] (1655), the large-scale attack by the [[Susquehannock]]s and allied tribes on several New Netherland settlements along the Hudson River\n* [[Esopus Wars]] (1659\u20131663), conflicts between the [[Esopus tribe]] of Lenape Indians and colonial New Netherlanders in [[Ulster County, New York]]\n* [[King Philip's War]] (1675\u201378) in [[New England]] between colonists and the [[Narragansett people]]\n* [[Tuscarora War]] (1711\u201315) in the [[Province of North Carolina]]\n* [[Yamasee War]] (1715\u201317) in the [[Province of South Carolina]]\n* [[Dummer's War]] (1722\u201325) in northern New England and French [[Acadia]] ([[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]])\n* [[Pontiac's War]] (1763\u201366) in the [[Great Lakes region]]<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/1001264.pdf |title=Operational Art in Pontiac's War |first=Thomas R. |last=Church |date=January 2015 |access-date=7 November 2018 |publisher=[[School of Advanced Military Studies]] |agency=United States Army Command and General Staff College |work=Defense Technical Information Center }}</ref>\n* [[Lord Dunmore's War]] (1774) in western Virginia ([[Kentucky]] and [[West Virginia]])\n\nIn several instances, the conflicts were a reflection of European rivalries, with Indian tribes splitting their alliances among the powers, generally siding with their trading partners. Various tribes fought on each side in [[King William's War]], [[Queen Anne's War]], [[Dummer's War]], [[King George's War]], and the [[French and Indian War]], allying with British or French colonists according to their own self interests.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Merrell | first1 = James H. | year = 2012 | title = Second Thoughts on Colonial Historians and American Indians | url = | journal = William and Mary Quarterly | volume = 69 | issue = 3| pages = 451\u2013512 | doi=10.5309/willmaryquar.69.3.0451}}</ref>\n\n==East of the Mississippi (1775\u20131842)==\n{{further|Sixty Years' War|Origins of the War of 1812|War of 1812}}\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"width:20em; font-size:11px; background:#efefef; margin-bottom:0;\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | '''Indian Wars<br />East of the Mississippi (post-1775)'''\n|-\n|\n* [[Western theater of the American Revolutionary War|American Revolution]] (1775\u20131783)\n* [[Cherokee\u2013American wars]] (1776\u20131794)\n* [[Northwest Indian War]] (1785\u20131795)\n* [[Nickajack Expedition]] (1794)\n* [[Sabine Expedition]] (1806)\n* [[War of 1812]] (1811\u20131815)\n** [[Tecumseh's War]] (1811\u20131813)\n** [[Creek War]] (1813\u20131814)\n** [[Peoria War]] (1813)\n* [[First Seminole War]] (1817\u20131818)\n* [[Winnebago War]] (1827)\n* [[Black Hawk War]] (1832)\n* [[Creek War of 1836|Creek War]] (1836)\n* Florida\u2013Georgia Border War (1836)\n* [[Second Seminole War]] (1835\u20131842)\n|}\n\nBritish merchants and government agents began supplying weapons to Indians living in the United States following the Revolution (1783-1812) in the hope that, if a war broke out, they would fight on the British side. The British further planned to set up an Indian nation in the Ohio-Wisconsin area to block further American expansion.<ref>Francis M. Carroll, ''A Good and Wise Measure: The Search for the Canadian-American Boundary, 1783\u20131842'' (2001) pp 23-25</ref> The US protested and declared war in [[War of 1812|1812]]. Most Indian tribes supported the British, especially those allied with [[Tecumseh]], but they were ultimately defeated by General [[William Henry Harrison]]. The War of 1812 spread to Indian rivalries, as well.\n\nMany refugees from defeated tribes went over the border to Canada; those in the South went to Florida while it was under Spanish control. During the early 19th century, the federal government was under pressure by settlers in many regions to expel Indians from their areas. The [[Indian Removal Act]] of 1830 offered Indians the choices of assimilating and giving up tribal membership, [[Indian removal|relocation]] to an Indian reservation with an exchange or payment for lands, or moving west. Some resisted fiercely, most notably the Seminoles in a [[First Seminole War|series of wars in Florida]]. They were never defeated, although some Seminoles did remove to Indian Territory. The United States gave up on the remainder, by then living defensively deep in the swamps and Everglades. Others were moved to reservations west of the Mississippi River, most famously the Cherokee whose relocation was called the \"[[Trail of Tears]].\"\n\n===American Revolutionary War 1775\u20131783===\n{{Main|Western theater of the American Revolutionary War}}\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2018}}\nThe [[American Revolutionary War]] was essentially two parallel wars for the American Patriots. The war in the east was a struggle against British rule, while the war in the west was an \"Indian War\". The newly proclaimed United States competed with the British for control of the territory east of the [[Mississippi River]]. Some Indians sided with the British, as they hoped to reduce American settlement and expansion. In one writer's opinion, the Revolutionary War was \"the most extensive and destructive\" Indian war in United States history.<ref>Raphael, ''People's History'', 244.</ref>\n\n[[File:Boone abduction.jpg|thumb|The abduction of [[Capture and rescue of Jemima Boone|Jemima Boone]] by [[Shawnee]] in 1776]]\nSome Indian tribes were divided over which side to support in the war, such as the [[Iroquois]] Confederacy based in New York and Pennsylvania who split: the [[Oneida people|Oneida]] and [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]] sided with the American Patriots, and the [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]], [[Seneca people|Seneca]], [[Cayuga people|Cayuga]], and [[Onondaga people|Onondaga]] sided with the British. The Iroquois tried to avoid fighting directly against one another, but the Revolution eventually forced intra-Iroquois combat, and both sides lost territory following the war. The Crown aided the landless Iroquois by rewarding them with a [[Six Nations 40, Ontario|reservation at Grand River]] in [[Ontario]] and some other lands. In the Southeast, the [[Cherokee]] split into a pro-patriot faction versus a pro-British faction that the Americans referred to as the [[Chickamauga Cherokee]]; they were led by [[Dragging Canoe]]. Many other tribes were similarly divided.\n\nWhen the British made peace with the Americans in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], they ceded a vast amount of Indian territory to the United States. Indian tribes who had sided with the British and had fought against the Americans were enemy combatants, as far as the United States was concerned; they were a conquered people who had lost their land.\n\n===Cherokee\u2013American wars===\n{{Main|Cherokee\u2013American wars}}\nThe frontier conflicts were almost non-stop, beginning with Cherokee involvement in the American Revolutionary War and continuing through late 1794. The so-called \"Chickamauga Cherokee\", later called \"Lower Cherokee,\" were from the [[Overhill Cherokee|Overhill Towns]] and later from the Lower Towns, Valley Towns, and Middle Towns. They followed war leader [[Dragging Canoe]] southwest, first to the [[Chickamauga Creek]] area near [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], then to the Five Lower Towns where they were joined by groups of [[Creek people|Muskogee]], white [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Tories]], runaway slaves, and renegade [[Chickasaw]], as well as by more than a hundred [[Shawnee]]. The primary targets of attack were the [[Washington District, North Carolina|Washington District]] colonies along the [[Watauga River|Watauga]], [[Holston River|Holston]], and [[Nolichucky River]]s, and in Carter's Valley in upper eastern Tennessee, as well as the settlements along the [[Cumberland River]] beginning with [[Fort Nashborough]] in 1780, even into Kentucky, plus against the [[State of Franklin|Franklin settlements]], and later states of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. The scope of attacks by the Chickamauga and their allies ranged from quick raids by small war parties to large campaigns by four or five hundred warriors, and once more than a thousand. The Upper Muskogee under Dragging Canoe's close ally [[Alexander McGillivray]] frequently joined their campaigns and also operated separately, and the settlements on the Cumberland came under attack from the Chickasaw, Shawnee from the north, and Delaware. Campaigns by Dragging Canoe and his successor [[John Watts (Cherokee chief)|John Watts]] were frequently conducted in conjunction with campaigns in the [[Northwest Territory]]. The colonists generally responded with attacks in which Cherokee settlements were completely destroyed, though usually without great loss of life on either side. The wars continued until the Treaty of [[Tellico Blockhouse]] in November 1794.<ref>Wiley Sword, ''President Washington's Indian War: The Struggle for the Old Northwest, 1790-1795'' (University of Oklahoma Press, 1985).</ref>\n\n===Northwest Indian War===\n{{Main|Northwest Indian War}}\n[[File:Fallen timbers.jpg|thumb|right|The Battle of Fallen Timbers]]\nIn 1787, the [[Northwest Ordinance]] officially organized the [[Northwest Territory]] for settlement, and American settlers began pouring into the region. Violence erupted as Indian tribes resisted, and so the administration of President [[George Washington]] sent armed expeditions into the area. However, in the [[Northwest Indian War]], a pan-tribal confederacy led by [[Blue Jacket]] (Shawnee), [[Little Turtle]] (Miami),<ref>Harvey Lewis Carter, ''The Life and Times of Little Turtle: First Sagamore of the Wabash'' (1987)</ref> [[Buckongahelas]] (Lenape), and [[Egushawa]] (Ottawa) defeated armies led by Generals [[Josiah Harmar]] and [[Arthur St. Clair]]. General St. Clair's defeat was the most severe loss ever inflicted upon an American army by Indians. The Americans attempted to negotiate a settlement, but Blue Jacket and the Shawnee-led confederacy insisted on a boundary line that the Americans found unacceptable, and so a new expedition was dispatched led by General [[Anthony Wayne]]. Wayne's army defeated the Indian confederacy at the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] in 1794. The Indians had hoped for British assistance; when that was not forthcoming, they were compelled to sign the [[Treaty of Greenville]] in 1795, which ceded Ohio and part of Indiana to the United States.<ref>Gregory Evans Dowd, ''A Spirited Resistance: The North American Indian Struggle for Unity, 1745-1815'' (Johns Hopkins U.P. 1992.)</ref>\n\n===Tecumseh, the Creek War, and the War of 1812===\n[[File:Creek War Treaty 1814.jpg|right|thumb|[[Treaty of Fort Jackson]] with the Creeks, 1814]]\nBy 1800, the Indian population was approximately 600,000 in the continental United States. By 1890, their population had declined to about 250,000.<ref>Thornton, Russel (1990). ''American Indian holocaust and survival: a population history since 1492''. University of Oklahoma Press. p. 43. {{ISBN|0-8061-2220-X}}.</ref> In 1800, [[William Henry Harrison]] became governor of the [[Indiana Territory]], under the direction of President [[Thomas Jefferson]], and he pursued an aggressive policy of obtaining titles to Indian lands. Shawnee brothers [[Tecumseh]] and [[Tenskwatawa]] organized [[Tecumseh's War]], another pan-tribal resistance to westward settlement.\n\nTecumseh was in the South attempting to recruit allies among the [[Creek (people)|Creeks]], [[Cherokee]]s, and [[Choctaw]]s when Harrison marched against the Indian confederacy, defeating Tenskwatawa and his followers at the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]] in 1811. The Americans hoped that the victory would end the militant resistance, but Tecumseh instead chose to ally openly with the British, who were soon at war with the Americans in the [[War of 1812]]. The [[Creek War]] (1813\u201314) began as a tribal conflict within the Creek tribe, but it became part of the larger struggle against American expansion. Tecumseh was killed by Harrison's army at the [[Battle of the Thames]], ending the resistance in the Old Northwest. The [[First Seminole War]] in 1818 resulted in the transfer of Florida from Spain to the United States in 1819.\n\n===Second Seminole War===\n{{Main|Second Seminole War|Seminole Wars}}\nAmerican settlers began to push into Florida, which was now an American territory and had some of the most fertile lands in the nation. Paul Hoffman claims that covetousness, racism, and \"self-defense\" against Indian raids played a major part in the settlers' determination to \"rid Florida of Indians once and for all\".<ref>Hoffman, Paul (2002). \"Florida's Frontiers\". Indiana Press. pgs. 295-304</ref> To compound the tension, runaway black slaves sometimes found refuge in Seminole camps, and the result was clashes between white settlers and the Indians residing there. [[Andrew Jackson]] sought to alleviate this problem by signing the [[Indian Removal Act]], which stipulated the relocation of Indians out of Florida\u2014by force if necessary. The [[Seminoles]] were relatively new arrivals in Florida, led by such powerful leaders as [[Aripeka]] (Sam Jones), [[Micanopy]], and [[Osceola]], and they had no intention of leaving their new lands. They retaliated against the settlers, and this led to the [[Second Seminole War]], the longest and most costly war that the Army ever waged against Indians.\n\nIn May 1830, the Indian Removal Act was passed by Congress which stipulated forced removal of Indians to Oklahoma. The [[Treaty of Paynes Landing]] was signed in May 1832 by a few Seminole chiefs who later recanted, claiming that they were tricked or forced to sign and making it clear that they would not consent to relocating to a reservation out west. The Seminoles' continued resistance to relocation led Florida to prepare for war. The St. Augustine Militia asked the US War Department for the loan of 500 muskets, and 500 volunteers were mobilized under Brig. Gen. [[Richard K. Call]]. Indian war parties raided farms and settlements, and families fled to forts or large towns, or out of the territory altogether. A war party led by Osceola captured a Florida militia supply train, killing eight of its guards and wounding six others; most of the goods taken were recovered by the militia in another fight a few days later. Sugar plantations were destroyed along the Atlantic coast south of [[St. Augustine, Florida]], with many of the slaves on the plantations joining the Seminoles.\n\n[[File:Attackblockhouse.png|thumb|Attack of the Seminoles on the blockhouse in December 1835]]\nThe US Army had 11 companies (about 550 soldiers) stationed in Florida. [[Fort King]] (Ocala) had only one company of soldiers, and it was feared that they might be overrun by the Seminoles. Three companies were stationed at [[Fort Brooke]] (Tampa), with another two expected imminently, so the army decided to send two companies to Fort King. On December 23, 1835, the two companies totaling 110 men left Fort Brooke under the command of Major [[Francis L. Dade]]. Seminoles shadowed the marching soldiers for five days, and they ambushed them and [[Dade Massacre|wiped out the command]] on December 28. Only three men survived, and one was hunted down and killed by a Seminole the next day. Survivors Ransome Clarke and Joseph Sprague returned to Fort Brooke. Clarke died of his wounds later, and he provided the only account of the battle from the army's perspective. The Seminoles lost three men and five wounded. On the same day as the massacre, Osceola and his followers shot and killed Agent Wiley Thompson and six others during an ambush outside of Fort King.\n\nOn December 29, General Clinch left Fort Drane with 750 soldiers, including 500 volunteers on an enlistment due to end January 1, 1836. The group was traveling to a Seminole stronghold called the [[Cove of the Withlacoochee]], an area of many lakes on the southwest side of the [[Withlacoochee River (Florida)|Withlacoochee River]]. When they reached the river, the soldiers could not find the ford, so Clinch ferried his regular troops across the river in a single canoe. Once they were across and had relaxed, the Seminoles attacked. The troops fixed bayonets and charged them, at the cost of four dead and 59 wounded. The militia provided cover as the army troops then withdrew across the river.\n\n[[File:Dademassacresite.jpg|thumb|The [[Dade Massacre]] was the US Army's worst defeat at the hands of Seminoles]]\nIn the [[Battle of Lake Okeechobee]], Colonel [[Zachary Taylor]] saw the first major action of the campaign. He left [[Fort Gardiner]] on the upper [[Kissimmee River]] with 1,000 men on December 19 and headed towards [[Lake Okeechobee]]. In the first two days, 90 Seminoles surrendered. On the third day, Taylor stopped to build [[Fort Basinger, Florida|Fort Basinger]] where he left his sick and enough men to guard the Seminoles who had surrendered. Taylor's column caught up with the main body of the Seminoles on the north shore of Lake Okeechobee on December 25.\n\nThe Seminoles were led by \"Alligator\", Sam Jones, and the recently escaped [[Wild Cat (Seminole)|Coacoochee]], and they were positioned in a hammock surrounded by [[Cladium|sawgrass]]. The ground was thick mud, and sawgrass easily cuts and burns the skin. Taylor had about 800 men, while the Seminoles numbered fewer than 400. Taylor sent in the Missouri volunteers first, moving his troops squarely into the center of the swamp. His plan was to make a direct attack rather than encircle the Indians. All his men were on foot. As soon as they came within range, the Indians opened with heavy fire. The volunteers broke and their commander Colonel Gentry was fatally wounded, so they retreated back across the swamp. The fighting in the sawgrass was deadliest for five companies of the Sixth Infantry; every officer but one was killed or wounded, along with most of their non-commissioned officers. The soldiers suffered 26 killed and 112 wounded, compared to 11 Seminoles killed and 14 wounded. No Seminoles were captured, although Taylor did capture 100 ponies and 600 head of cattle.\n\n[[File:Seminole War in Everglades.jpg|thumb|Marines searching for the Seminoles among the mangroves]]\nBy 1842, the war was winding down and most Seminoles had left Florida for Oklahoma. The US Army officially recorded 1,466 deaths in the Second Seminole War, mostly from disease. The number killed in action is less clear. Mahon reports{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} 328 regular army killed in action, while Missall reports{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} that Seminoles killed 269 officers and men. Almost half of those deaths occurred in the Dade Massacre, Battle of Lake Okeechobee, and Harney Massacre. Similarly, Mahon reports{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} 69 deaths for the Navy, while Missal reports{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} 41 for the Navy and Marine Corps. Mahon and the Florida Board of State Institutions agree{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} that 55 volunteer officers and men were killed by the Seminoles, while Missall says{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} that the number is unknown. A northern newspaper carried a report{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} that more than 80 civilians were killed by Indians in Florida in 1839. By the end of 1843, 3,824 Indians had been shipped from Florida to the Indian Territory.\n\n==West of the Mississippi (1811\u20131924)==\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"width:20em; font-size:11px; background:#efefef; margin-bottom:0;\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | '''Indian Wars<br />West of the Mississippi'''\n|-\n|\n* [[Arikara War]] (1823)\n* [[Osage Indian War]] (1837)\n* [[Texas\u2013Indian wars]] (1836\u20131877)\n** [[Comanche Wars]] (1836\u20131877)\n** [[Antelope Hills expedition]] (1858)\n** [[Comanche Campaign]] (1867\u20131875)\n** [[Red River War]] (1874\u20131875)\n** [[Buffalo Hunters' War]] (1876\u20131877)\n* [[Cayuse War]] (1847\u20131855)\n* [[Apache Wars]] (1849\u20131924)\n** [[Jicarilla War]] (1849\u20131855)\n** [[Apache Wars#Chiricahua Wars|Chiricahua Wars]] (1860\u20131886)\n** [[Yavapai War|Tonto War]] (1871\u20131875)\n** [[Victorio's War]] (1879\u20131880)\n** [[Apache Wars#Geronimo's War|Geronimo's War]] (1881\u20131886)\n** [[Post 1887 Apache Wars period]] (1887\u20131924)\n* [[Yuma War]] (1850\u20131853)\n* [[Ute Wars]] (1850\u20131923)\n** [[Battle at Fort Utah]] (1850)\n** [[Walker War]] (1853\u20131854)\n** [[Tintic War]] (1856)\n** [[Black Hawk War (1865\u201372)|Black Hawk War]] (1865\u20131872)\n** [[White River War]] (1879)\n** [[Ute War]] (1887)\n** [[Bluff War]] (1914\u20131915)\n** [[Bluff Skirmish]] (1921)\n** [[Posey War]] (1923)\n* [[Sioux Wars]] (1854\u20131891)\n** [[First Sioux War]] (1854-1856)\n** [[Dakota War of 1862|Dakota War]] (1862)\n** [[Colorado War]] (1863\u20131865)\n** [[Powder River Expedition (1865)|Powder River War]] (1865)\n** [[Red Cloud's War]] (1866\u20131868)\n** [[Battle of Beecher Island]] (1868)\n** [[Great Sioux War of 1876|Great Sioux War]] (1876\u20131877)\n** [[Northern Cheyenne Exodus]] (1878-1879)\n** [[Ghost Dance War]] (1890\u20131891)\n* [[Rogue River Wars]] (1855\u20131856)\n* [[Yakima War]] (1855\u20131858)\n** [[Puget Sound War]] (1855\u20131856)\n** [[Coeur d'Alene War]] (1858)\n* [[Mohave War]] (1858\u20131859)\n* [[Navajo Wars#American period|Navajo Wars]] (1849\u20131866)\n* [[Paiute War]] (1860)\n* [[Yavapai Wars]] (1861\u20131875)\n* [[Snake War]] (1864\u20131869)\n* [[Hualapai War (1865\u201370)|Hualapai War]] (1865\u20131870)\n* [[Modoc War]] (1872\u20131873)\n* [[Nez Perce War]] (1877)\n* [[Bannock War]] (1878)\n* [[Crow War]] (1887)\n* [[Bannock War of 1895|Bannock Uprising]] (1895)\n* [[Yaqui Uprising]] (1896)\n* [[Battle of Sugar Point]] (1898)\n* [[Crazy Snake Rebellion]] (1909)\n* [[Battle of Kelley Creek]] (1911)\n* [[Battle of Kelley Creek#Last Massacre|Last Massacre]] (1911)\n* [[Battle of Bear Valley]] (1918)\n|}\n\nThe series of conflicts in the western United States between Indians, American settlers, and the United States Army are generally known as the Indian Wars. Many of these conflicts occurred during and after the Civil War until the closing of the frontier in about 1890.  However, regions of the West that were settled before the Civil War saw significant conflicts prior to 1860, such as Texas, New Mexico, Utah, Oregon, California, and Washington state.\n\nVarious statistics have been developed concerning the devastation of these wars on the peoples involved. Gregory Michno used records dealing with figures \"as a direct result of\" engagements and concluded that \"of the 21,586 total casualties tabulated in this survey, military personnel and civilians accounted for 6,596 (31%), while Indian casualties totaled about 14,990 (69%)\" for the period of 1850\u201390. However, Michno says that he \"used the army's estimates in almost every case\" and \"the number of casualties in this study are inherently biased toward army estimations\". His work includes almost nothing on \"Indian war parties\", and he states that \"army records are often incomplete\".<ref>{{Cite book| first = Gregory| last = Michno| title = Encyclopedia of Indian wars: western battles and skirmishes, 1850\u20131890| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MmNtF5n-VuEC&pg=PA353&dq#v=onepage&q=&f=false| publisher = Mountain Press Publishing| year = 2003| page = 353| isbn = 978-0-87842-468-9}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Michno, more conflicts with Indians occurred in the states bordering Mexico than in the interior states. Arizona ranked highest, with 310 known battles fought within the state's boundaries between Americans and Indians. Also, Arizona ranked highest of the states in deaths from the wars. At least 4,340 people were killed, including both the settlers and the Indians, over twice as many as occurred in Texas, the second highest-ranking state. Most of the deaths in Arizona were caused by the [[Apache]]s. Michno also says that 51 percent of the battles took place in Arizona, Texas, and New Mexico between 1850 and 1890, as well as 37 percent of the casualties in the country west of the Mississippi River.<ref>Michno, pg. 367</ref>\n\n===Background===\nAmerican settlers and fur trappers had spread into the western United States territories and had established the [[Santa Fe Trail]] and the [[Oregon Trail]]. Relations were generally peaceful between American settlers and Indians. The Bents of [[Bent's Fort]] on the Santa Fe Trail had friendly relations with the Cheyenne and Arapaho, and peace was established on the Oregon Trail by the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1851)|Treaty of Fort Laramie]] signed in 1851 between the United States and the Plains Indians and the Indians of the northern Rocky Mountains. The treaty allowed passage by settlers, building roads, and stationing troops along the Oregon Trail.\n\n[[File: Western Indian Wars.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|Battles, army posts, and the general location of tribes in the American West]]\nThe [[Pike's Peak Gold Rush]] of 1859 introduced a substantial white population into the Front Range of the Rockies, supported by a trading lifeline that crossed the central Great Plains. Advancing settlement following the passage of the [[Homestead Act]] and the growing [[First Transcontinental Railroad|transcontinental railways]] following the Civil War further destabilized the situation, placing white settlers into direct competition for the land and resources of the Great Plains and the Rocky Mountain West.<ref>''The Battle of Beecher Island and the Indian War of 1867\u20131869'', by John H.

Many tribes fought American settlers at one time or another, from the [[Ute Tribe|Utes]] of the [[Great Basin]] to the [[Nez Perce tribe]] of [[Idaho]]. But the [[Sioux]] of the [[Great Plains|Northern Plains]] and the [[Apache Tribe|Apaches]] of the Southwest waged the most aggressive warfare, led by resolute, militant leaders such as [[Red Cloud]] and [[Crazy Horse]]. The Sioux were relatively new arrivals on the Plains, as they had been sedentary farmers in the [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes region]] previously. They moved west, displacing other Indian tribes and becoming feared warriors. The Apaches supplemented their economy by raiding other tribes, and they practiced warfare to avenge the death of a kinsman.\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], Army units were withdrawn to fight the war in the east. They were replaced by the volunteer infantry and cavalry raised by the states of California and Oregon, by the western territorial governments, or by the local militias. These units fought the Indians and kept open communications with the east, holding the west for the Union and defeating the Confederate attempt to capture the New Mexico Territory. After 1865, national policy called for all Indians either to [[Cultural assimilation of Native Americans|assimilate into the American population]] as citizens, or to live peacefully on reservations. Raids and wars between tribes were not allowed, and armed Indian bands off a reservation were the responsibility of the Army to round up and return.\n\n===Texas===\n{{Main|Texas\u2013Indian wars|Comanche-Mexico War}}\n\nIn the 18th century, [[Spanish Texas|Spanish settlers in Texas]] came into conflict with the Apaches, Comanches, and Karankawas, among other tribes. Large numbers of American settlers reached Texas in the 1830s, and a series of armed confrontations broke out until the 1870s, mostly between Texans and Comanches. During the same period, the Comanches and their allies raided hundreds of miles deep into Mexico (see [[Comanche\u2013Mexico Wars]]).\n\n[[File:Scalping wilbarger.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Josiah P. Wilbarger]] being scalped by Comanches, 1833]]\n\nThe first notable battle was the [[Fort Parker massacre]] in 1836, in which a huge war party of Comanches, Kiowas, Wichitas, and Delawares attacked the Texan outpost at Fort Parker. A small number of settlers were killed during the raid, and the abduction of [[Cynthia Ann Parker]] and two other children caused widespread outrage among Texans.\n\nThe [[Republic of Texas]] was declared and secured some sovereignty in their war with Mexico, and the Texas government under President [[Sam Houston]] pursued a policy of engagement with the Comanches and Kiowas. Houston had lived with the Cherokees, but the Cherokees joined with Mexican forces to fight against Texas. Houston resolved the conflict without resorting to arms, refusing to believe that the Cherokees would take up arms against his government.<ref>{{cite web| last=Krenek | first=Thomas H.| title=Sam Houston | work=Handbook of Texas Online| publisher=Texas State Historical Association| url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fho73 | accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref> The administration of [[Mirabeau B. Lamar]] followed Houston's and took a very different policy towards the Indians. Lamar removed the Cherokees to the west and then sought to deport the Comanches and Kiowas. This led to a series of battles, including the [[Council House Fight]], in which the Texas militia killed 33 Comanche chiefs at a peace parley. The Comanches retaliated with the [[Great Raid of 1840]], and the [[Battle of Plum Creek]] followed several days later.\n\n[[File:Chief Quanah Parker of the Kwahadi Comanche2.jpg|thumb|[[Quanah Parker]], son of a Comanche Chief and a Texas settler; his family's story spans the history of the [[Texas\u2013Indian wars]]]]\n\nThe Lamar Administration was known for its failed and expensive Indian policy; the cost of the war with the Indians exceeded the annual revenue of the government throughout his four-year term. It was followed by a second Houston administration, which resumed the previous policy of diplomacy. Texas signed treaties with all of the tribes, including the Comanches. In the 1840s and 1850s, the Comanches and their allies shifted most of their raiding activities to Mexico, using Texas as a safe haven from Mexican retaliation.\n\nTexas joined the Union in 1846, and the Federal government and Texas took up the struggle between the Plains Indians and the settlers. The conflicts were particularly vicious and bloody on the Texas frontier in 1856 through 1858, as settlers continued to expand their settlements into the [[Comancheria]]. The first Texan incursion into the heart of the Comancheria was in 1858, the so-called [[Antelope Hills Expedition]] marked by the [[Battle of Little Robe Creek]].\n\nThe battles between settlers and Indians continued in 1860, and Texas militia destroyed an Indian camp at the [[Battle of Pease River]]. In the aftermath of the battle, the Texans learned that they had recaptured Cynthia Ann Parker, the little girl captured by the Comanches in 1836. She returned to live with her family, but she missed her children, including her son [[Quanah Parker]]. He was the son of Parker and Comanche Chief [[Peta Nocona]], and he became a Comanche war chief at the [[Second Battle of Adobe Walls]]. He ultimately surrendered to the overwhelming force of the federal government and moved to a reservation in southwestern Oklahoma in 1875.\n\n===Pacific Northwest===\n{{Main|Cayuse War|Yakima War|Puget Sound War|Rogue River Wars|Spokane \u2013 Coeur d'Alene \u2013 Paloos War|Snake War|Nez Perce War|Bannock War|Sheepeater Indian War}}\n\nA number of wars occurred in the wake of the [[Oregon Treaty]] of 1846 and the creation of [[Oregon Territory]] and [[Washington Territory]]. Among the causes of conflict were a sudden immigration to the region and a series of gold rushes throughout the [[Pacific Northwest]]. The [[Whitman massacre]] of 1847 triggered the [[Cayuse War]], which led to fighting from the [[Cascade Range]] to the Rocky Mountains. The Cayuse were defeated in 1855, but the conflict had expanded and continued in what became known as the [[Yakima War]] (1855\u20131858). Washington Territory Governor [[Isaac Stevens]] tried to compel Indian tribes to sign treaties ceding land and establishing reservations. The [[Yakama Nation|Yakama]] signed one of the treaties negotiated during the [[Walla Walla Council (1855)|Walla Walla Council]] of 1855, establishing the [[Yakama Indian Reservation]], but Stevens' attempts served mainly to intensify hostilities. Gold discoveries near [[Fort Colville]] resulted in many miners crossing Yakama lands via [[Naches Pass]], and conflicts rapidly escalated into violence. It took several years for the Army to defeat the Yakama, during which time war spread to the [[Puget Sound region]] west of the Cascades. The [[Puget Sound War]] of 1855\u20131856 was triggered in part by the Yakima War and in part by the use of intimidation to compel tribes to sign land cession treaties. The [[Treaty of Medicine Creek]] of 1855 established an unrealistically small reservation on poor land for the [[Nisqually tribe|Nisqually]] and [[Puyallup tribe]]s. Violence broke out in the [[White River (Washington)|White River]] valley, along the route to Naches Pass and connecting Nisqually and Yakama lands. The Puget Sound War is often remembered in connection with the [[Battle of Seattle (1856)]] and the execution of Nisqually [[Chief Leschi]], a central figure of the war.<ref name=beckey>{{cite book |last= Beckey |first= Fred |authorlink= Fred Beckey |title= Range of Glaciers: The Exploration and Survey of the Northern Cascade Range |publisher= Oregon Historical Society Press |year= 2003 |isbn= 978-0-87595-243-7 |pages= 101\u2013114}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Chief leschi.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nisqually tribe|Nisqually]] Chief [[Leschi (Native American leader)|Leschi]] was hanged for murder in 1858. He was exonerated by Washington State in 2004.]]\n\nIn 1858, the fighting spread on the east side of the Cascades. This second phase of the Yakima War is known as the [[Spokane \u2013 Coeur d'Alene \u2013 Paloos War|Coeur d'Alene War]]. The Yakama, [[Palus tribe|Palouse]], [[Spokane people|Spokane]], and [[Coeur d'Alene people|Coeur d'Alene]] tribes were defeated at the [[Battle of Four Lakes]] in late 1858.<ref name=beckey/>\n\nIn southwest Oregon, tensions and skirmishes escalated between American settlers and the [[Rogue River (tribe)|Rogue River peoples]] into the [[Rogue River Wars]] of 1855\u20131856. The [[California Gold Rush]] helped fuel a large increase in the number of people traveling south through the [[Rogue Valley|Rogue River Valley]]. Gold discoveries continued to trigger violent conflict between prospectors and Indians. Beginning in 1858, the [[Fraser Canyon Gold Rush]] in British Columbia drew large numbers of miners, many from Washington, Oregon, and California, culminating in the [[Fraser Canyon War]]. This conflict occurred in Canada, but the militias involved were formed mostly of Americans. The discovery of gold in Idaho and Oregon in the 1860s led to similar conflicts which culminated in the [[Bear River Massacre]] in 1863 and [[Snake War]] from 1864 to 1868.\n\nIn the late 1870s, another series of armed conflicts occurred in Oregon and Idaho, spreading east into Wyoming and Montana. The [[Nez Perce War]] of 1877 is known particularly for [[Chief Joseph]] and the four-month, 1,200-mile fighting retreat of a band of about 800 Nez Perce, including women and children. The Nez Perce War was caused by a large influx of settlers, the appropriation of Indian lands, and a gold rush\u2014this time in Idaho. The Nez Perce engaged 2,000 American soldiers of different military units, as well as their Indian auxiliaries. They fought \"eighteen engagements, including four major battles and at least four fiercely contested skirmishes\", according to Alvin Josephy.<ref>Alvin M. Josephy: Nez Perce Summer, 1877: The US Army and the Nee-Me-Poo Crisis; {{ISBN|978-0-917298-82-0}}, pp 632-633</ref> Chief Joseph and the Nez Perce were much admired for their conduct in the war and their fighting ability.<ref>Josephy, pp. 632-633</ref>\n\nThe [[Bannock War]] broke out the following year for similar reasons. The [[Sheepeater Indian War]] in 1879 was the last conflict in the area.\n\n===Southwest===\n{{Main|Navajo Wars|Yuma War|Mohave War|Apache Wars|Black Hawk War (1865\u20131872)|Apache\u2013Mexico Wars|Long Walk of the Navajo|Yavapai Wars}}\n[[File:Apache chieff Geronimo (right) and his warriors in 1886.jpg|thumb|[[Geronimo]] (right) and his warriors in 1886]]\nConflicts arose in the southwestern United States following the acquisition of [[Alta California]] and [[Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico]] from Mexico at the end of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] in 1848, and the [[Gadsden Purchase]] in 1853. These spanned from 1846 to at least 1895. The first conflicts were in the [[New Mexico Territory]], and later in California and the [[Utah Territory]] during and after the [[California Gold Rush]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nIndian tribes in the southwest had been engaged in cycles of trading and fighting with one another and with settlers for centuries prior to the United States gaining control of the region. These conflicts with the United States involved every non-pueblo tribe in the region and often were a continuation of Mexican\u2013Spanish conflicts. The [[Navajo Wars]] and [[Apache Wars]] are perhaps the best known. The last major campaign of the military against Indians in the Southwest involved 5,000 troops in the field, and resulted in the surrender of [[Chiricahua]] Apache [[Geronimo]] and his band of 24 warriors, women, and children in 1886. {{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===California===\n{{Main|California Indian Wars|Gila Expedition|Mariposa War|Klamath and Salmon River War|Modoc War|Bald Hills War|Pitt River Expedition|Mendocino War|Owens Valley Indian War|Snake War}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}\nThe U.S. Army kept a small garrison west of the Rockies, but the [[California Gold Rush]] brought a great influx of miners and settlers into the area. The result was that most of the early conflicts with the California Indians involved local parties of miners or settlers. During the [[American Civil War]], California volunteers replaced Federal troops and won the ongoing [[Bald Hills War]] and the [[Owens Valley Indian War]] and engaged in minor actions in northern California. California and Oregon volunteer garrisons in [[Nevada]], Oregon, Idaho, Utah, New Mexico, and the [[Arizona Territory|Arizona]] Territories also engaged in conflicts with the Apache, Cheyenne, Goshute, Navajo, Paiute, Shoshone, Sioux, and Ute Indians from 1862 to 1866. Following the Civil War, California was mostly pacified, but federal troops replaced the volunteers and again took up the struggle against Indians in the remote regions of the [[Mojave Desert]], and in the northeast against the [[Snake War|Snakes]] (1864\u20131868) and [[Modoc War|Modocs]] (1872\u20131873).\n\n===Great Basin===\n{{Main|Ute Wars|Walker War|Paiute War|Bear River Massacre|Goshute War|Snake War|Black Hawk War (Utah)|Bannock War|White River War}}\n\nThe tribes of the [[Great Basin]] were mostly [[Shoshone]], and they were greatly affected by the [[Oregon Trail|Oregon]] and [[California Trail]]s and by [[Mormon pioneers]] to Utah. The Shoshone had friendly relations with American and British fur traders and trappers, beginning with their encounter with [[Lewis and Clark]].\n\nThe traditional way of life of the Indians was disrupted, and they began raiding travelers along the trails and aggression toward Mormon settlers. During the American Civil War, the [[California Volunteers]] stationed in Utah responded to complaints, which resulted in the [[Bear River Massacre]].<ref>''The Shoshoni Frontier and the Bear River Massacre'', Brigham D.

The number of Sioux dead in the uprising is mostly undocumented. After the war, 303 Sioux warriors were convicted of murder and rape by U.S. military tribunals and sentenced to death.  Most of the death sentences were commuted by President Lincoln, but on December 26, 1862, in [[Mankato, Minnesota]], 38 Dakota Sioux men were [[hanging|hanged]] in what is still today the largest penal mass [[capital punishment|execution]] in U.S. history.<ref name=\"shultz\">{{cite book|last=Carley|first=Kenneth|title=The Sioux Uprising of 1862|year=1961|publisher=[[Minnesota Historical Society]]|page=65|quote=Most of the thirty-nine were baptized, including Tatemima (or Round Wind), who was reprieved at the last minute.}}</ref>\n\nAfter the expulsion of the Dakota, some refugees and warriors made their way to [[Lakota people|Lakota]] lands in what is now [[North Dakota]].

The Sioux retreated further, but again faced an American army in 1864; this time, Gen.

Control of the Great Plains fell under the Army's [[Department of the Missouri]], an administrative area of over 1,000,000&nbsp;mi<sup>2</sup> encompassing all land between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains. Maj. Gen. [[Winfield S. Hancock]] had led the department in 1866 but had mishandled his campaign, resulting in [[Sioux]] and [[Cheyenne]] raids that attacked mail stagecoaches, burned the stations, and killed the employees. They also raped, killed, and kidnapped many settlers on the frontier.<ref>Roy Morris, Jr., ''Sheridan: The Life and Wars of General Phil Sheridan'' (1992) p. 299.</ref>\n\n[[Philip Sheridan]] was the military governor of Louisiana and Texas in 1866, but President Johnson removed him from that post, claiming that he was ruling over the area with absolute tyranny and insubordination. Shortly after, Hancock was removed as head of the Department of the Missouri and Sheridan replaced him in August 1867.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Border Command: General Phil Sheridan in the West|last=Rister|first=Carl|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1944|isbn=|location=Westport Connecticut|pages=30\u2013122}}</ref> He was ordered to pacify the plains and take control of the Indians there, and he immediately called [[George Armstrong Custer|General Custer]] back to command of the [[7th Cavalry Regiment|7th Cavalry]]; Hancock had suspended him.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Custerology: The Enduring Legacy of the Indian Wars and George Armstrong Custer|last=Elliot|first=Michael|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=103\u2013146}}</ref>\n\n[[File:The Battle of Prairie Dog Creek.jpg|thumb|The Battle of Prairie Dog Creek (August 21, 1867) ended the Army's offensive operations on the Kansas frontier for the year.]]\n\nThe Department of Missouri was in poor shape upon Sheridan's arrival. Commissioners from the government had signed a peace treaty in October 1867 with the [[Comanche]], [[Kiowa]], Kiowa Apache, [[Cheyenne]], and [[Arapaho]] which offered them reservation land to live on along with food and supplies,<ref name=\":0\" /> but Congress failed to pass it. The promised supplies from the government were not reaching the Indians and they were beginning to starve, numbering an estimated 6,000. Sheridan had only 2,600 men at the time to control them and to defend against any raids or attacks, and only 1,200 of his men were mounted.<ref name=\":3\" /> These men were also under-supplied and stationed at forts that were in poor condition. They were also mostly unproven units that replaced retired veterans from the Civil War.\n\nSheridan attempted to improve the conditions of the military outpost and the Indians on the plains through a peace-oriented strategy. Toward the beginning of his command, members of the Cheyenne and Arapaho followed him on his travels from [[Fort Larned National Historic Site|Fort Larned]] to [[Fort Dodge, Iowa|Fort Dodge]] where he spoke to them. They brought their problems to him and explained how the promised supplies were not being delivered. In response, Sheridan gave them a generous supply of rations. Shortly after, the Saline Valley settlements were attacked,{{by whom|date=May 2019}} and that was followed by other violent raids and kidnappings in the region.{{by whom|date=May 2019}} Sheridan wanted to respond in force but was constrained by the government's peace policy and the lack of well-supplied mounted troops.<ref name=\":0\" /> He could not deploy official military units, so he commissioned a group of 47 frontiersmen and sharpshooters called [[Solomon's Avengers]]. They investigated the raids near Arickaree Creek and were attacked by Indians on September 17, 1868. The Avengers were under siege for eight days by some 700 Indian warriors, but they were able to keep them at bay until military units arrived to help. The Avengers lost six men and another 15 were wounded. Sherman finally gave Sheridan authority to respond in force to these threats.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Terrible Swift Sword: The Life of General Philip H.

His forces were better fed and clothed than the Indians and they could launch a campaign in the winter months. His winter campaign of 1868 started with the [[19th Kansas Volunteers]] from Custer's 7th Cavalry, along with five battalions of infantry under Major John H. Page setting out from Fort Dodge on November 5. A few days later, a force moved from [[Fort Bascom]] to [[Fort Cobb]] consisting of units of the [[5th Cavalry Regiment]] and two companies of infantry, where they met up with units from the [[3rd Cavalry Regiment (United States)|3rd Cavalry]] leaving from Fort Lyon. Sheridan directed the opening month of the campaign from [[Fort Supply|Camp Supply]]. The Units from the 5th and 3rd Cavalry met at Fort Cobb without any sign of the 19th Kansas, but they had a lead on a band of Indians nearby and Custer led a force after them.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=The Personal Memoirs of P.

Custer lost 21 men killed and 13 men wounded, and a unit went missing under Major Elliott's command. Custer shot 675 ponies that were vital for the Indians' survival on the plains.<ref name=\":1\" /> Immediately following the battle, Sheridan received backlash from Washington politicians who defended Black Kettle as a peace-loving Indian. This began the controversy as to whether the event was best described as a military victory or as a massacre, a discussion which endures among historians to this day.\n\n[[File:Indian history for young folks (1919) (14566708480).jpg|thumb|U.S. cavalry attacking an Indian village]]\nFollowing Washita, Sheridan oversaw the refitting of the 19th Kansas and personally led them down the Washita River toward the Wichita Mountains. He met with Custer along the Washita River and they searched for Major Elliott's missing unit. They found the bodies of the missing unit and the bodies of Mrs. Blynn and her child who had been taken by Indians the previous summer near Fort Lyon.<ref name=\":1\" /> The defeat at Washita had scared many of the tribes and Sheridan was able to round up the majority of the Kiowa and Comanche people at Fort Cobb in December and get them to reservations. He began negotiations with Chief Little Robe of the Cheyennes and with [[Yellow Bear]] about living on the reservations.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Phil Sheridan and His Army.|last=Hutton|first=Paul|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|year=1985|isbn=|location=Lincoln Nebraska|pages=28\u2013120}}</ref> Sheridan then began the construction of Camp Sill, later called [[Fort Sill]], named after General Sill who died at [[Stones River National Battlefield|Stone River]].\n\nSheridan was called back to Washington following the election of [[Ulysses S. Grant|President Grant]]. He was informed of his promotion to lieutenant general of the army and reassigned from the department. Sheridan protested and was allowed to stay in Missouri with the rank of lieutenant general. The last remnants of Indian resistance came from Tall Bull Dog soldiers and elements of the [[Sioux]] and Northern Cheyenne tribes. The 5th Cavalry from [[Fort McPherson]] were sent to handle the situation on the Platte River in Nebraska. In May, the two forces collided at Summit Springs and the Indians were pursued out of the region. This brought an end to Sheridan's campaign, as the Indians had successfully been removed from the Platte and Arkansas and the majority of those in Kansas had been settled onto reservations. Sheridan left in 1869 to take command of the Army and was replaced by Major General Schofield.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n====Red Cloud's War and the Treaty of Fort Laramie====\n{{Main|Red Cloud's War|Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)}}\n\n====Black Hills War====\n[[File:Custer Staghounds.jpg|thumb|right|Custer and [[Bloody Knife]] (kneeling left), Custer's favorite [[United States Army Indian Scouts|Indian Scout]]]]\nIn 1875, the [[Great Sioux War of 1876\u201377]] erupted when the Dakota gold rush penetrated the [[Black Hills]]. The government decided to stop evicting trespassers from the Black Hills and offered to buy the land from the Sioux. When they refused, the government decided instead to take the land and gave the Lakota until January 31, 1876 to return to reservations. The tribes did not return to the reservations by the deadline, and Lt. Colonel [[George Custer]] found the main encampment of the Lakota and their allies at the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]]. Custer and his men were separated from their main body of troops, and they were all killed by the far more numerous Indians led by [[Crazy Horse]] and inspired by [[Sitting Bull]]'s earlier vision of victory. The [[Anheuser-Busch]] brewing company made prints of a dramatic painting that depicted \"Custer's Last Fight\" and had them framed and hung in many American saloons as an advertising campaign, helping to create a popular image of this battle.<ref>{{cite book| last = Griske| first = Michael| title = The Diaries of John Hunton| publisher = Heritage Books| year = 2005| pages = 78\u201379| isbn = 978-0-7884-3804-2 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anheuser-busch.com/historyOfMarketing.html|title=Community \u2013 Diversity |publisher=Anheuser-Busch |date= |accessdate=2011-05-28}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Woundedknee1891.jpg|thumb|right|Mass grave for the dead Lakota following the [[Wounded Knee Massacre]]]]\nThe Lakotas conducted a [[Ghost Dance]] ritual on the reservation at Wounded Knee, [[South Dakota]] in 1890, and the Army attempted to subdue them.

{{lang-fr|Guerres des Premi\u00e8res Nations}}) is the collective name for the various armed conflicts that were fought by European governments and colonists, and later by the governments and settlers, against various American Indian and First Nation tribes. These conflicts occurred in North America from the time of the earliest colonial settlements in the 17th century until the early 20th century. The various wars resulted from a wide variety of factors, including cultural clashes, land disputes, and criminal acts committed by both sides. The European powers and their colonies also enlisted Indian tribes to help them conduct warfare against each other's colonial settlements.\n\nAfter the [[American Revolution]], many conflicts were local to specific states or regions and frequently involved disputes over land use; some entailed cycles of violent reprisal. In Canada, 11 [[Numbered Treaties]] covering most of the First Nations lands limited the number of such conflicts.\n\nAs settlers spread westward across America and Canada after 1780, armed conflicts increased in size, duration, and intensity between settlers and various Indian and First Nation tribes. The climax came in the [[War of 1812]], when major Indian coalitions in the Midwest and the South fought against the United States and lost. Conflict with settlers became much less common and was usually resolved by treaty, often through sale or exchange of territory between the federal government and specific tribes. The [[Indian Removal Act]] of 1830 authorized the American government to enforce the Indian removal from east of the Mississippi River to the west on the [[American frontier]], especially Oklahoma. The federal policy of removal was eventually refined in the West, as American settlers kept expanding their territories, to relocate Indian tribes to specially designated and federally protected and subsidized reservations.\n\n==Colonial period (1609\u20131774)==\n{{further|European colonization of the Americas}}\n[[File:1622 massacre jamestown de Bry.jpg|thumb|[[Indian massacre of 1622]]]]\n[[File:Siege of Fort Detroit.jpg|thumb|right|[[Siege of Fort Detroit]] during [[Pontiac's Rebellion]] in 1763]]\nThe colonization of America by the English, French, Spanish, Dutch, and Swedish was resisted by some Indian tribes and assisted by other tribes. Wars and other armed conflicts in the 17th and 18th centuries included:\n* [[Beaver Wars]] (1609\u20131701) between the [[Iroquois]] and the French, who allied with the [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquians]]\n* [[Anglo-Powhatan Wars]] (1610\u201314, 1622\u201332, 1644\u201346), including the [[Indian massacre of 1622|1622 Jamestown Massacre]], between English colonists and the [[Powhatan Confederacy]] in the [[Colony of Virginia]]\n* [[Pequot War]] of 1636\u201338 between the [[Pequot]] tribe and colonists from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and [[Connecticut Colony]] and allied tribes\n* [[Kieft's War]] (1643\u201345) in the Dutch territory of [[New Netherland]] ([[New Jersey]] and [[New York (state)|New York]]) between colonists and the [[Lenape]] people\n* [[Peach Tree War]] (1655), the large-scale attack by the [[Susquehannock]]s and allied tribes on several New Netherland settlements along the Hudson River\n* [[Esopus Wars]] (1659\u20131663), conflicts between the [[Esopus tribe]] of Lenape Indians and colonial New Netherlanders in [[Ulster County, New York]]\n* [[King Philip's War]] (1675\u201378) in [[New England]] between colonists and the [[Narragansett people]]\n* [[Tuscarora War]] (1711\u201315) in the [[Province of North Carolina]]\n* [[Yamasee War]] (1715\u201317) in the [[Province of South Carolina]]\n* [[Dummer's War]] (1722\u201325) in northern New England and French [[Acadia]] ([[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]])\n* [[Pontiac's War]] (1763\u201366) in the [[Great Lakes region]]<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/1001264.pdf |title=Operational Art in Pontiac's War |first=Thomas R. |last=Church |date=January 2015 |access-date=7 November 2018 |publisher=[[School of Advanced Military Studies]] |agency=United States Army Command and General Staff College |work=Defense Technical Information Center }}</ref>\n* [[Lord Dunmore's War]] (1774) in western Virginia ([[Kentucky]] and [[West Virginia]])\n\nIn several instances, the conflicts were a reflection of European rivalries, with Indian tribes splitting their alliances among the powers, generally siding with their trading partners.

The British further planned to set up an Indian nation in the Ohio-Wisconsin area to block further American expansion.<ref>Francis M. Carroll, ''A Good and Wise Measure: The Search for the Canadian-American Boundary, 1783\u20131842'' (2001) pp 23-25</ref> The US protested and declared war in [[War of 1812|1812]]. Most Indian tribes supported the British, especially those allied with [[Tecumseh]], but they were ultimately defeated by General [[William Henry Harrison]]. The War of 1812 spread to Indian rivalries, as well.\n\nMany refugees from defeated tribes went over the border to Canada; those in the South went to Florida while it was under Spanish control. During the early 19th century, the federal government was under pressure by settlers in many regions to expel Indians from their areas. The [[Indian Removal Act]] of 1830 offered Indians the choices of assimilating and giving up tribal membership, [[Indian removal|relocation]] to an Indian reservation with an exchange or payment for lands, or moving west. Some resisted fiercely, most notably the Seminoles in a [[First Seminole War|series of wars in Florida]]. They were never defeated, although some Seminoles did remove to Indian Territory. The United States gave up on the remainder, by then living defensively deep in the swamps and Everglades. Others were moved to reservations west of the Mississippi River, most famously the Cherokee whose relocation was called the \"[[Trail of Tears]].\"\n\n===American Revolutionary War 1775\u20131783===\n{{Main|Western theater of the American Revolutionary War}}\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2018}}\nThe [[American Revolutionary War]] was essentially two parallel wars for the American Patriots. The war in the east was a struggle against British rule, while the war in the west was an \"Indian War\". The newly proclaimed United States competed with the British for control of the territory east of the [[Mississippi River]]. Some Indians sided with the British, as they hoped to reduce American settlement and expansion. In one writer's opinion, the Revolutionary War was \"the most extensive and destructive\" Indian war in United States history.<ref>Raphael, ''People's History'', 244.</ref>\n\n[[File:Boone abduction.jpg|thumb|The abduction of [[Capture and rescue of Jemima Boone|Jemima Boone]] by [[Shawnee]] in 1776]]\nSome Indian tribes were divided over which side to support in the war, such as the [[Iroquois]] Confederacy based in New York and Pennsylvania who split: the [[Oneida people|Oneida]] and [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]] sided with the American Patriots, and the [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]], [[Seneca people|Seneca]], [[Cayuga people|Cayuga]], and [[Onondaga people|Onondaga]] sided with the British. The Iroquois tried to avoid fighting directly against one another, but the Revolution eventually forced intra-Iroquois combat, and both sides lost territory following the war. The Crown aided the landless Iroquois by rewarding them with a [[Six Nations 40, Ontario|reservation at Grand River]] in [[Ontario]] and some other lands. In the Southeast, the [[Cherokee]] split into a pro-patriot faction versus a pro-British faction that the Americans referred to as the [[Chickamauga Cherokee]]; they were led by [[Dragging Canoe]]. Many other tribes were similarly divided.\n\nWhen the British made peace with the Americans in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], they ceded a vast amount of Indian territory to the United States. Indian tribes who had sided with the British and had fought against the Americans were enemy combatants, as far as the United States was concerned; they were a conquered people who had lost their land.\n\n===Cherokee\u2013American wars===\n{{Main|Cherokee\u2013American wars}}\nThe frontier conflicts were almost non-stop, beginning with Cherokee involvement in the American Revolutionary War and continuing through late 1794. The so-called \"Chickamauga Cherokee\", later called \"Lower Cherokee,\" were from the [[Overhill Cherokee|Overhill Towns]] and later from the Lower Towns, Valley Towns, and Middle Towns. They followed war leader [[Dragging Canoe]] southwest, first to the [[Chickamauga Creek]] area near [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], then to the Five Lower Towns where they were joined by groups of [[Creek people|Muskogee]], white [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Tories]], runaway slaves, and renegade [[Chickasaw]], as well as by more than a hundred [[Shawnee]]. The primary targets of attack were the [[Washington District, North Carolina|Washington District]] colonies along the [[Watauga River|Watauga]], [[Holston River|Holston]], and [[Nolichucky River]]s, and in Carter's Valley in upper eastern Tennessee, as well as the settlements along the [[Cumberland River]] beginning with [[Fort Nashborough]] in 1780, even into Kentucky, plus against the [[State of Franklin|Franklin settlements]], and later states of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. The scope of attacks by the Chickamauga and their allies ranged from quick raids by small war parties to large campaigns by four or five hundred warriors, and once more than a thousand. The Upper Muskogee under Dragging Canoe's close ally [[Alexander McGillivray]] frequently joined their campaigns and also operated separately, and the settlements on the Cumberland came under attack from the Chickasaw, Shawnee from the north, and Delaware. Campaigns by Dragging Canoe and his successor [[John Watts (Cherokee chief)|John Watts]] were frequently conducted in conjunction with campaigns in the [[Northwest Territory]]. The colonists generally responded with attacks in which Cherokee settlements were completely destroyed, though usually without great loss of life on either side. The wars continued until the Treaty of [[Tellico Blockhouse]] in November 1794.<ref>Wiley Sword, ''President Washington's Indian War: The Struggle for the Old Northwest, 1790-1795'' (University of Oklahoma Press, 1985).</ref>\n\n===Northwest Indian War===\n{{Main|Northwest Indian War}}\n[[File:Fallen timbers.jpg|thumb|right|The Battle of Fallen Timbers]]\nIn 1787, the [[Northwest Ordinance]] officially organized the [[Northwest Territory]] for settlement, and American settlers began pouring into the region. Violence erupted as Indian tribes resisted, and so the administration of President [[George Washington]] sent armed expeditions into the area. However, in the [[Northwest Indian War]], a pan-tribal confederacy led by [[Blue Jacket]] (Shawnee), [[Little Turtle]] (Miami),<ref>Harvey Lewis Carter, ''The Life and Times of Little Turtle: First Sagamore of the Wabash'' (1987)</ref> [[Buckongahelas]] (Lenape), and [[Egushawa]] (Ottawa) defeated armies led by Generals [[Josiah Harmar]] and [[Arthur St. Clair]]. General St. Clair's defeat was the most severe loss ever inflicted upon an American army by Indians. The Americans attempted to negotiate a settlement, but Blue Jacket and the Shawnee-led confederacy insisted on a boundary line that the Americans found unacceptable, and so a new expedition was dispatched led by General [[Anthony Wayne]]. Wayne's army defeated the Indian confederacy at the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] in 1794. The Indians had hoped for British assistance; when that was not forthcoming, they were compelled to sign the [[Treaty of Greenville]] in 1795, which ceded Ohio and part of Indiana to the United States.<ref>Gregory Evans Dowd, ''A Spirited Resistance: The North American Indian Struggle for Unity, 1745-1815'' (Johns Hopkins U.P. 1992.)</ref>\n\n===Tecumseh, the Creek War, and the War of 1812===\n[[File:Creek War Treaty 1814.jpg|right|thumb|[[Treaty of Fort Jackson]] with the Creeks, 1814]]\nBy 1800, the Indian population was approximately 600,000 in the continental United States. By 1890, their population had declined to about 250,000.<ref>Thornton, Russel (1990). ''American Indian holocaust and survival: a population history since 1492''. University of Oklahoma Press. p. 43. {{ISBN|0-8061-2220-X}}.</ref> In 1800, [[William Henry Harrison]] became governor of the [[Indiana Territory]], under the direction of President [[Thomas Jefferson]], and he pursued an aggressive policy of obtaining titles to Indian lands. Shawnee brothers [[Tecumseh]] and [[Tenskwatawa]] organized [[Tecumseh's War]], another pan-tribal resistance to westward settlement.\n\nTecumseh was in the South attempting to recruit allies among the [[Creek (people)|Creeks]], [[Cherokee]]s, and [[Choctaw]]s when Harrison marched against the Indian confederacy, defeating Tenskwatawa and his followers at the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]] in 1811. The Americans hoped that the victory would end the militant resistance, but Tecumseh instead chose to ally openly with the British, who were soon at war with the Americans in the [[War of 1812]]. The [[Creek War]] (1813\u201314) began as a tribal conflict within the Creek tribe, but it became part of the larger struggle against American expansion. Tecumseh was killed by Harrison's army at the [[Battle of the Thames]], ending the resistance in the Old Northwest. The [[First Seminole War]] in 1818 resulted in the transfer of Florida from Spain to the United States in 1819.\n\n===Second Seminole War===\n{{Main|Second Seminole War|Seminole Wars}}\nAmerican settlers began to push into Florida, which was now an American territory and had some of the most fertile lands in the nation. Paul Hoffman claims that covetousness, racism, and \"self-defense\" against Indian raids played a major part in the settlers' determination to \"rid Florida of Indians once and for all\".<ref>Hoffman, Paul (2002). \"Florida's Frontiers\". Indiana Press. pgs. 295-304</ref> To compound the tension, runaway black slaves sometimes found refuge in Seminole camps, and the result was clashes between white settlers and the Indians residing there. [[Andrew Jackson]] sought to alleviate this problem by signing the [[Indian Removal Act]], which stipulated the relocation of Indians out of Florida\u2014by force if necessary. The [[Seminoles]] were relatively new arrivals in Florida, led by such powerful leaders as [[Aripeka]] (Sam Jones), [[Micanopy]], and [[Osceola]], and they had no intention of leaving their new lands. They retaliated against the settlers, and this led to the [[Second Seminole War]], the longest and most costly war that the Army ever waged against Indians.\n\nIn May 1830, the Indian Removal Act was passed by Congress which stipulated forced removal of Indians to Oklahoma. The [[Treaty of Paynes Landing]] was signed in May 1832 by a few Seminole chiefs who later recanted, claiming that they were tricked or forced to sign and making it clear that they would not consent to relocating to a reservation out west. The Seminoles' continued resistance to relocation led Florida to prepare for war. The St. Augustine Militia asked the US War Department for the loan of 500 muskets, and 500 volunteers were mobilized under Brig. Gen. [[Richard K. Call]]. Indian war parties raided farms and settlements, and families fled to forts or large towns, or out of the territory altogether. A war party led by Osceola captured a Florida militia supply train, killing eight of its guards and wounding six others; most of the goods taken were recovered by the militia in another fight a few days later. Sugar plantations were destroyed along the Atlantic coast south of [[St. Augustine, Florida]], with many of the slaves on the plantations joining the Seminoles.\n\n[[File:Attackblockhouse.png|thumb|Attack of the Seminoles on the blockhouse in December 1835]]\nThe US Army had 11 companies (about 550 soldiers) stationed in Florida. [[Fort King]] (Ocala) had only one company of soldiers, and it was feared that they might be overrun by the Seminoles. Three companies were stationed at [[Fort Brooke]] (Tampa), with another two expected imminently, so the army decided to send two companies to Fort King. On December 23, 1835, the two companies totaling 110 men left Fort Brooke under the command of Major [[Francis L. Dade]]. Seminoles shadowed the marching soldiers for five days, and they ambushed them and [[Dade Massacre|wiped out the command]] on December 28. Only three men survived, and one was hunted down and killed by a Seminole the next day. Survivors Ransome Clarke and Joseph Sprague returned to Fort Brooke. Clarke died of his wounds later, and he provided the only account of the battle from the army's perspective. The Seminoles lost three men and five wounded. On the same day as the massacre, Osceola and his followers shot and killed Agent Wiley Thompson and six others during an ambush outside of Fort King.\n\nOn December 29, General Clinch left Fort Drane with 750 soldiers, including 500 volunteers on an enlistment due to end January 1, 1836. The group was traveling to a Seminole stronghold called the [[Cove of the Withlacoochee]], an area of many lakes on the southwest side of the [[Withlacoochee River (Florida)|Withlacoochee River]]. When they reached the river, the soldiers could not find the ford, so Clinch ferried his regular troops across the river in a single canoe. Once they were across and had relaxed, the Seminoles attacked. The troops fixed bayonets and charged them, at the cost of four dead and 59 wounded. The militia provided cover as the army troops then withdrew across the river.\n\n[[File:Dademassacresite.jpg|thumb|The [[Dade Massacre]] was the US Army's worst defeat at the hands of Seminoles]]\nIn the [[Battle of Lake Okeechobee]], Colonel [[Zachary Taylor]] saw the first major action of the campaign. He left [[Fort Gardiner]] on the upper [[Kissimmee River]] with 1,000 men on December 19 and headed towards [[Lake Okeechobee]]. In the first two days, 90 Seminoles surrendered. On the third day, Taylor stopped to build [[Fort Basinger, Florida|Fort Basinger]] where he left his sick and enough men to guard the Seminoles who had surrendered. Taylor's column caught up with the main body of the Seminoles on the north shore of Lake Okeechobee on December 25.\n\nThe Seminoles were led by \"Alligator\", Sam Jones, and the recently escaped [[Wild Cat (Seminole)|Coacoochee]], and they were positioned in a hammock surrounded by [[Cladium|sawgrass]]. The ground was thick mud, and sawgrass easily cuts and burns the skin. Taylor had about 800 men, while the Seminoles numbered fewer than 400. Taylor sent in the Missouri volunteers first, moving his troops squarely into the center of the swamp. His plan was to make a direct attack rather than encircle the Indians. All his men were on foot. As soon as they came within range, the Indians opened with heavy fire. The volunteers broke and their commander Colonel Gentry was fatally wounded, so they retreated back across the swamp. The fighting in the sawgrass was deadliest for five companies of the Sixth Infantry; every officer but one was killed or wounded, along with most of their non-commissioned officers. The soldiers suffered 26 killed and 112 wounded, compared to 11 Seminoles killed and 14 wounded. No Seminoles were captured, although Taylor did capture 100 ponies and 600 head of cattle.\n\n[[File:Seminole War in Everglades.jpg|thumb|Marines searching for the Seminoles among the mangroves]]\nBy 1842, the war was winding down and most Seminoles had left Florida for Oklahoma. The US Army officially recorded 1,466 deaths in the Second Seminole War, mostly from disease. The number killed in action is less clear. Mahon reports{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} 328 regular army killed in action, while Missall reports{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} that Seminoles killed 269 officers and men. Almost half of those deaths occurred in the Dade Massacre, Battle of Lake Okeechobee, and Harney Massacre. Similarly, Mahon reports{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} 69 deaths for the Navy, while Missal reports{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} 41 for the Navy and Marine Corps.

Many of these conflicts occurred during and after the Civil War until the closing of the frontier in about 1890.  However, regions of the West that were settled before the Civil War saw significant conflicts prior to 1860, such as Texas, New Mexico, Utah, Oregon, California, and Washington state.\n\nVarious statistics have been developed concerning the devastation of these wars on the peoples involved. Gregory Michno used records dealing with figures \"as a direct result of\" engagements and concluded that \"of the 21,586 total casualties tabulated in this survey, military personnel and civilians accounted for 6,596 (31%), while Indian casualties totaled about 14,990 (69%)\" for the period of 1850\u201390. However, Michno says that he \"used the army's estimates in almost every case\" and \"the number of casualties in this study are inherently biased toward army estimations\". His work includes almost nothing on \"Indian war parties\", and he states that \"army records are often incomplete\".<ref>{{Cite book| first = Gregory| last = Michno| title = Encyclopedia of Indian wars: western battles and skirmishes, 1850\u20131890| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MmNtF5n-VuEC&pg=PA353&dq#v=onepage&q=&f=false| publisher = Mountain Press Publishing| year = 2003| page = 353| isbn = 978-0-87842-468-9}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Michno, more conflicts with Indians occurred in the states bordering Mexico than in the interior states. Arizona ranked highest, with 310 known battles fought within the state's boundaries between Americans and Indians. Also, Arizona ranked highest of the states in deaths from the wars. At least 4,340 people were killed, including both the settlers and the Indians, over twice as many as occurred in Texas, the second highest-ranking state. Most of the deaths in Arizona were caused by the [[Apache]]s. Michno also says that 51 percent of the battles took place in Arizona, Texas, and New Mexico between 1850 and 1890, as well as 37 percent of the casualties in the country west of the Mississippi River.<ref>Michno, pg. 367</ref>\n\n===Background===\nAmerican settlers and fur trappers had spread into the western United States territories and had established the [[Santa Fe Trail]] and the [[Oregon Trail]]. Relations were generally peaceful between American settlers and Indians. The Bents of [[Bent's Fort]] on the Santa Fe Trail had friendly relations with the Cheyenne and Arapaho, and peace was established on the Oregon Trail by the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1851)|Treaty of Fort Laramie]] signed in 1851 between the United States and the Plains Indians and the Indians of the northern Rocky Mountains. The treaty allowed passage by settlers, building roads, and stationing troops along the Oregon Trail.\n\n[[File: Western Indian Wars.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|Battles, army posts, and the general location of tribes in the American West]]\nThe [[Pike's Peak Gold Rush]] of 1859 introduced a substantial white population into the Front Range of the Rockies, supported by a trading lifeline that crossed the central Great Plains. Advancing settlement following the passage of the [[Homestead Act]] and the growing [[First Transcontinental Railroad|transcontinental railways]] following the Civil War further destabilized the situation, placing white settlers into direct competition for the land and resources of the Great Plains and the Rocky Mountain West.<ref>''The Battle of Beecher Island and the Indian War of 1867\u20131869'', by John H.

Many tribes fought American settlers at one time or another, from the [[Ute Tribe|Utes]] of the [[Great Basin]] to the [[Nez Perce tribe]] of [[Idaho]]. But the [[Sioux]] of the [[Great Plains|Northern Plains]] and the [[Apache Tribe|Apaches]] of the Southwest waged the most aggressive warfare, led by resolute, militant leaders such as [[Red Cloud]] and [[Crazy Horse]]. The Sioux were relatively new arrivals on the Plains, as they had been sedentary farmers in the [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes region]] previously. They moved west, displacing other Indian tribes and becoming feared warriors. The Apaches supplemented their economy by raiding other tribes, and they practiced warfare to avenge the death of a kinsman.\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], Army units were withdrawn to fight the war in the east. They were replaced by the volunteer infantry and cavalry raised by the states of California and Oregon, by the western territorial governments, or by the local militias. These units fought the Indians and kept open communications with the east, holding the west for the Union and defeating the Confederate attempt to capture the New Mexico Territory. After 1865, national policy called for all Indians either to [[Cultural assimilation of Native Americans|assimilate into the American population]] as citizens, or to live peacefully on reservations. Raids and wars between tribes were not allowed, and armed Indian bands off a reservation were the responsibility of the Army to round up and return.\n\n===Texas===\n{{Main|Texas\u2013Indian wars|Comanche-Mexico War}}\n\nIn the 18th century, [[Spanish Texas|Spanish settlers in Texas]] came into conflict with the Apaches, Comanches, and Karankawas, among other tribes. Large numbers of American settlers reached Texas in the 1830s, and a series of armed confrontations broke out until the 1870s, mostly between Texans and Comanches. During the same period, the Comanches and their allies raided hundreds of miles deep into Mexico (see [[Comanche\u2013Mexico Wars]]).\n\n[[File:Scalping wilbarger.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Josiah P. Wilbarger]] being scalped by Comanches, 1833]]\n\nThe first notable battle was the [[Fort Parker massacre]] in 1836, in which a huge war party of Comanches, Kiowas, Wichitas, and Delawares attacked the Texan outpost at Fort Parker. A small number of settlers were killed during the raid, and the abduction of [[Cynthia Ann Parker]] and two other children caused widespread outrage among Texans.\n\nThe [[Republic of Texas]] was declared and secured some sovereignty in their war with Mexico, and the Texas government under President [[Sam Houston]] pursued a policy of engagement with the Comanches and Kiowas. Houston had lived with the Cherokees, but the Cherokees joined with Mexican forces to fight against Texas. Houston resolved the conflict without resorting to arms, refusing to believe that the Cherokees would take up arms against his government.<ref>{{cite web| last=Krenek | first=Thomas H.| title=Sam Houston | work=Handbook of Texas Online| publisher=Texas State Historical Association| url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fho73 | accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref> The administration of [[Mirabeau B. Lamar]] followed Houston's and took a very different policy towards the Indians. Lamar removed the Cherokees to the west and then sought to deport the Comanches and Kiowas. This led to a series of battles, including the [[Council House Fight]], in which the Texas militia killed 33 Comanche chiefs at a peace parley. The Comanches retaliated with the [[Great Raid of 1840]], and the [[Battle of Plum Creek]] followed several days later.\n\n[[File:Chief Quanah Parker of the Kwahadi Comanche2.jpg|thumb|[[Quanah Parker]], son of a Comanche Chief and a Texas settler; his family's story spans the history of the [[Texas\u2013Indian wars]]]]\n\nThe Lamar Administration was known for its failed and expensive Indian policy; the cost of the war with the Indians exceeded the annual revenue of the government throughout his four-year term. It was followed by a second Houston administration, which resumed the previous policy of diplomacy. Texas signed treaties with all of the tribes, including the Comanches. In the 1840s and 1850s, the Comanches and their allies shifted most of their raiding activities to Mexico, using Texas as a safe haven from Mexican retaliation.\n\nTexas joined the Union in 1846, and the Federal government and Texas took up the struggle between the Plains Indians and the settlers. The conflicts were particularly vicious and bloody on the Texas frontier in 1856 through 1858, as settlers continued to expand their settlements into the [[Comancheria]]. The first Texan incursion into the heart of the Comancheria was in 1858, the so-called [[Antelope Hills Expedition]] marked by the [[Battle of Little Robe Creek]].\n\nThe battles between settlers and Indians continued in 1860, and Texas militia destroyed an Indian camp at the [[Battle of Pease River]]. In the aftermath of the battle, the Texans learned that they had recaptured Cynthia Ann Parker, the little girl captured by the Comanches in 1836. She returned to live with her family, but she missed her children, including her son [[Quanah Parker]]. He was the son of Parker and Comanche Chief [[Peta Nocona]], and he became a Comanche war chief at the [[Second Battle of Adobe Walls]]. He ultimately surrendered to the overwhelming force of the federal government and moved to a reservation in southwestern Oklahoma in 1875.\n\n===Pacific Northwest===\n{{Main|Cayuse War|Yakima War|Puget Sound War|Rogue River Wars|Spokane \u2013 Coeur d'Alene \u2013 Paloos War|Snake War|Nez Perce War|Bannock War|Sheepeater Indian War}}\n\nA number of wars occurred in the wake of the [[Oregon Treaty]] of 1846 and the creation of [[Oregon Territory]] and [[Washington Territory]]. Among the causes of conflict were a sudden immigration to the region and a series of gold rushes throughout the [[Pacific Northwest]]. The [[Whitman massacre]] of 1847 triggered the [[Cayuse War]], which led to fighting from the [[Cascade Range]] to the Rocky Mountains. The Cayuse were defeated in 1855, but the conflict had expanded and continued in what became known as the [[Yakima War]] (1855\u20131858). Washington Territory Governor [[Isaac Stevens]] tried to compel Indian tribes to sign treaties ceding land and establishing reservations. The [[Yakama Nation|Yakama]] signed one of the treaties negotiated during the [[Walla Walla Council (1855)|Walla Walla Council]] of 1855, establishing the [[Yakama Indian Reservation]], but Stevens' attempts served mainly to intensify hostilities. Gold discoveries near [[Fort Colville]] resulted in many miners crossing Yakama lands via [[Naches Pass]], and conflicts rapidly escalated into violence. It took several years for the Army to defeat the Yakama, during which time war spread to the [[Puget Sound region]] west of the Cascades. The [[Puget Sound War]] of 1855\u20131856 was triggered in part by the Yakima War and in part by the use of intimidation to compel tribes to sign land cession treaties. The [[Treaty of Medicine Creek]] of 1855 established an unrealistically small reservation on poor land for the [[Nisqually tribe|Nisqually]] and [[Puyallup tribe]]s. Violence broke out in the [[White River (Washington)|White River]] valley, along the route to Naches Pass and connecting Nisqually and Yakama lands. The Puget Sound War is often remembered in connection with the [[Battle of Seattle (1856)]] and the execution of Nisqually [[Chief Leschi]], a central figure of the war.<ref name=beckey>{{cite book |last= Beckey |first= Fred |authorlink= Fred Beckey |title= Range of Glaciers: The Exploration and Survey of the Northern Cascade Range |publisher= Oregon Historical Society Press |year= 2003 |isbn= 978-0-87595-243-7 |pages= 101\u2013114}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Chief leschi.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nisqually tribe|Nisqually]] Chief [[Leschi (Native American leader)|Leschi]] was hanged for murder in 1858. He was exonerated by Washington State in 2004.]]\n\nIn 1858, the fighting spread on the east side of the Cascades. This second phase of the Yakima War is known as the [[Spokane \u2013 Coeur d'Alene \u2013 Paloos War|Coeur d'Alene War]]. The Yakama, [[Palus tribe|Palouse]], [[Spokane people|Spokane]], and [[Coeur d'Alene people|Coeur d'Alene]] tribes were defeated at the [[Battle of Four Lakes]] in late 1858.<ref name=beckey/>\n\nIn southwest Oregon, tensions and skirmishes escalated between American settlers and the [[Rogue River (tribe)|Rogue River peoples]] into the [[Rogue River Wars]] of 1855\u20131856. The [[California Gold Rush]] helped fuel a large increase in the number of people traveling south through the [[Rogue Valley|Rogue River Valley]]. Gold discoveries continued to trigger violent conflict between prospectors and Indians. Beginning in 1858, the [[Fraser Canyon Gold Rush]] in British Columbia drew large numbers of miners, many from Washington, Oregon, and California, culminating in the [[Fraser Canyon War]]. This conflict occurred in Canada, but the militias involved were formed mostly of Americans. The discovery of gold in Idaho and Oregon in the 1860s led to similar conflicts which culminated in the [[Bear River Massacre]] in 1863 and [[Snake War]] from 1864 to 1868.\n\nIn the late 1870s, another series of armed conflicts occurred in Oregon and Idaho, spreading east into Wyoming and Montana. The [[Nez Perce War]] of 1877 is known particularly for [[Chief Joseph]] and the four-month, 1,200-mile fighting retreat of a band of about 800 Nez Perce, including women and children. The Nez Perce War was caused by a large influx of settlers, the appropriation of Indian lands, and a gold rush\u2014this time in Idaho. The Nez Perce engaged 2,000 American soldiers of different military units, as well as their Indian auxiliaries. They fought \"eighteen engagements, including four major battles and at least four fiercely contested skirmishes\", according to Alvin Josephy.<ref>Alvin M. Josephy: Nez Perce Summer, 1877: The US Army and the Nee-Me-Poo Crisis; {{ISBN|978-0-917298-82-0}}, pp 632-633</ref> Chief Joseph and the Nez Perce were much admired for their conduct in the war and their fighting ability.<ref>Josephy, pp. 632-633</ref>\n\nThe [[Bannock War]] broke out the following year for similar reasons. The [[Sheepeater Indian War]] in 1879 was the last conflict in the area.\n\n===Southwest===\n{{Main|Navajo Wars|Yuma War|Mohave War|Apache Wars|Black Hawk War (1865\u20131872)|Apache\u2013Mexico Wars|Long Walk of the Navajo|Yavapai Wars}}\n[[File:Apache chieff Geronimo (right) and his warriors in 1886.jpg|thumb|[[Geronimo]] (right) and his warriors in 1886]]\nConflicts arose in the southwestern United States following the acquisition of [[Alta California]] and [[Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico]] from Mexico at the end of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] in 1848, and the [[Gadsden Purchase]] in 1853. These spanned from 1846 to at least 1895. The first conflicts were in the [[New Mexico Territory]], and later in California and the [[Utah Territory]] during and after the [[California Gold Rush]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nIndian tribes in the southwest had been engaged in cycles of trading and fighting with one another and with settlers for centuries prior to the United States gaining control of the region. These conflicts with the United States involved every non-pueblo tribe in the region and often were a continuation of Mexican\u2013Spanish conflicts. The [[Navajo Wars]] and [[Apache Wars]] are perhaps the best known. The last major campaign of the military against Indians in the Southwest involved 5,000 troops in the field, and resulted in the surrender of [[Chiricahua]] Apache [[Geronimo]] and his band of 24 warriors, women, and children in 1886. {{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===California===\n{{Main|California Indian Wars|Gila Expedition|Mariposa War|Klamath and Salmon River War|Modoc War|Bald Hills War|Pitt River Expedition|Mendocino War|Owens Valley Indian War|Snake War}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}\nThe U.S. Army kept a small garrison west of the Rockies, but the [[California Gold Rush]] brought a great influx of miners and settlers into the area. The result was that most of the early conflicts with the California Indians involved local parties of miners or settlers. During the [[American Civil War]], California volunteers replaced Federal troops and won the ongoing [[Bald Hills War]] and the [[Owens Valley Indian War]] and engaged in minor actions in northern California. California and Oregon volunteer garrisons in [[Nevada]], Oregon, Idaho, Utah, New Mexico, and the [[Arizona Territory|Arizona]] Territories also engaged in conflicts with the Apache, Cheyenne, Goshute, Navajo, Paiute, Shoshone, Sioux, and Ute Indians from 1862 to 1866. Following the Civil War, California was mostly pacified, but federal troops replaced the volunteers and again took up the struggle against Indians in the remote regions of the [[Mojave Desert]], and in the northeast against the [[Snake War|Snakes]] (1864\u20131868) and [[Modoc War|Modocs]] (1872\u20131873).\n\n===Great Basin===\n{{Main|Ute Wars|Walker War|Paiute War|Bear River Massacre|Goshute War|Snake War|Black Hawk War (Utah)|Bannock War|White River War}}\n\nThe tribes of the [[Great Basin]] were mostly [[Shoshone]], and they were greatly affected by the [[Oregon Trail|Oregon]] and [[California Trail]]s and by [[Mormon pioneers]] to Utah. The Shoshone had friendly relations with American and British fur traders and trappers, beginning with their encounter with [[Lewis and Clark]].\n\nThe traditional way of life of the Indians was disrupted, and they began raiding travelers along the trails and aggression toward Mormon settlers. During the American Civil War, the [[California Volunteers]] stationed in Utah responded to complaints, which resulted in the [[Bear River Massacre]].<ref>''The Shoshoni Frontier and the Bear River Massacre'', Brigham D.

After six weeks of fighting in Minnesota, led mostly by Chief [[Taoyateduta]] (aka, Little Crow), records conclusively show that more than 500 U.S. soldiers and settlers died in the conflict, though many more may have died in small raids or after being captured. The number of Sioux dead in the uprising is mostly undocumented. After the war, 303 Sioux warriors were convicted of murder and rape by U.S. military tribunals and sentenced to death.  Most of the death sentences were commuted by President Lincoln, but on December 26, 1862, in [[Mankato, Minnesota]], 38 Dakota Sioux men were [[hanging|hanged]] in what is still today the largest penal mass [[capital punishment|execution]] in U.S. history.<ref name=\"shultz\">{{cite book|last=Carley|first=Kenneth|title=The Sioux Uprising of 1862|year=1961|publisher=[[Minnesota Historical Society]]|page=65|quote=Most of the thirty-nine were baptized, including Tatemima (or Round Wind), who was reprieved at the last minute.}}</ref>\n\nAfter the expulsion of the Dakota, some refugees and warriors made their way to [[Lakota people|Lakota]] lands in what is now [[North Dakota]]. Battles continued between Minnesota regiments and combined Lakota and Dakota forces through 1864, as Colonel [[Henry Hastings Sibley|Henry Sibley]] pursued the Sioux into Dakota Territory. Sibley's army defeated the Lakota and Dakota in three major battles in 1863: the [[Battle of Dead Buffalo Lake]] on July 26, 1863, the [[Battle of Stony Lake]] on July 28, 1863, and the [[Battle of Whitestone Hill]] on September 3, 1863. The Sioux retreated further, but again faced an American army in 1864; this time, Gen. [[Alfred Sully]] led a force from near [[Fort Pierre, South Dakota]], and decisively defeated the Sioux at the [[Battle of Killdeer Mountain]] on July 28, 1864.\n\n====Colorado War, Sand Creek Massacre, and the Sioux War of 1865====\n{{Main|Colorado War|Sand Creek massacre|Powder River Expedition (1865)}}\n[[File:Mochi Southern Cheyenne.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mochi (Cheyenne)|Mochi]], a Southern Cheyenne in Black Kettle's camp, became a warrior after her experiences at the [[Sand Creek massacre]]]]\n\nOn November 29, 1864, the Colorado territory militia responded to a series of Indian attacks on white settlements by attacking a Cheyenne and Arapaho encampment on Sand Creek in southeastern Colorado, under orders to take no prisoners.

This attack was followed up by numerous raids along the South Platte both east and west of Julesburg, and by a second raid on Julesburg in early February.

Control of the Great Plains fell under the Army's [[Department of the Missouri]], an administrative area of over 1,000,000&nbsp;mi<sup>2</sup> encompassing all land between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains. Maj. Gen. [[Winfield S. Hancock]] had led the department in 1866 but had mishandled his campaign, resulting in [[Sioux]] and [[Cheyenne]] raids that attacked mail stagecoaches, burned the stations, and killed the employees. They also raped, killed, and kidnapped many settlers on the frontier.<ref>Roy Morris, Jr., ''Sheridan: The Life and Wars of General Phil Sheridan'' (1992) p. 299.</ref>\n\n[[Philip Sheridan]] was the military governor of Louisiana and Texas in 1866, but President Johnson removed him from that post, claiming that he was ruling over the area with absolute tyranny and insubordination. Shortly after, Hancock was removed as head of the Department of the Missouri and Sheridan replaced him in August 1867.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Border Command: General Phil Sheridan in the West|last=Rister|first=Carl|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1944|isbn=|location=Westport Connecticut|pages=30\u2013122}}</ref> He was ordered to pacify the plains and take control of the Indians there, and he immediately called [[George Armstrong Custer|General Custer]] back to command of the [[7th Cavalry Regiment|7th Cavalry]]; Hancock had suspended him.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Custerology: The Enduring Legacy of the Indian Wars and George Armstrong Custer|last=Elliot|first=Michael|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=103\u2013146}}</ref>\n\n[[File:The Battle of Prairie Dog Creek.jpg|thumb|The Battle of Prairie Dog Creek (August 21, 1867) ended the Army's offensive operations on the Kansas frontier for the year.]]\n\nThe Department of Missouri was in poor shape upon Sheridan's arrival. Commissioners from the government had signed a peace treaty in October 1867 with the [[Comanche]], [[Kiowa]], Kiowa Apache, [[Cheyenne]], and [[Arapaho]] which offered them reservation land to live on along with food and supplies,<ref name=\":0\" /> but Congress failed to pass it. The promised supplies from the government were not reaching the Indians and they were beginning to starve, numbering an estimated 6,000. Sheridan had only 2,600 men at the time to control them and to defend against any raids or attacks, and only 1,200 of his men were mounted.<ref name=\":3\" /> These men were also under-supplied and stationed at forts that were in poor condition. They were also mostly unproven units that replaced retired veterans from the Civil War.\n\nSheridan attempted to improve the conditions of the military outpost and the Indians on the plains through a peace-oriented strategy. Toward the beginning of his command, members of the Cheyenne and Arapaho followed him on his travels from [[Fort Larned National Historic Site|Fort Larned]] to [[Fort Dodge, Iowa|Fort Dodge]] where he spoke to them. They brought their problems to him and explained how the promised supplies were not being delivered. In response, Sheridan gave them a generous supply of rations. Shortly after, the Saline Valley settlements were attacked,{{by whom|date=May 2019}} and that was followed by other violent raids and kidnappings in the region.{{by whom|date=May 2019}} Sheridan wanted to respond in force but was constrained by the government's peace policy and the lack of well-supplied mounted troops.<ref name=\":0\" /> He could not deploy official military units, so he commissioned a group of 47 frontiersmen and sharpshooters called [[Solomon's Avengers]]. They investigated the raids near Arickaree Creek and were attacked by Indians on September 17, 1868. The Avengers were under siege for eight days by some 700 Indian warriors, but they were able to keep them at bay until military units arrived to help. The Avengers lost six men and another 15 were wounded. Sherman finally gave Sheridan authority to respond in force to these threats.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Terrible Swift Sword: The Life of General Philip H.

His forces were better fed and clothed than the Indians and they could launch a campaign in the winter months. His winter campaign of 1868 started with the [[19th Kansas Volunteers]] from Custer's 7th Cavalry, along with five battalions of infantry under Major John H. Page setting out from Fort Dodge on November 5. A few days later, a force moved from [[Fort Bascom]] to [[Fort Cobb]] consisting of units of the [[5th Cavalry Regiment]] and two companies of infantry, where they met up with units from the [[3rd Cavalry Regiment (United States)|3rd Cavalry]] leaving from Fort Lyon. Sheridan directed the opening month of the campaign from [[Fort Supply|Camp Supply]]. The Units from the 5th and 3rd Cavalry met at Fort Cobb without any sign of the 19th Kansas, but they had a lead on a band of Indians nearby and Custer led a force after them.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=The Personal Memoirs of P.

Custer lost 21 men killed and 13 men wounded, and a unit went missing under Major Elliott's command. Custer shot 675 ponies that were vital for the Indians' survival on the plains.<ref name=\":1\" /> Immediately following the battle, Sheridan received backlash from Washington politicians who defended Black Kettle as a peace-loving Indian. This began the controversy as to whether the event was best described as a military victory or as a massacre, a discussion which endures among historians to this day.\n\n[[File:Indian history for young folks (1919) (14566708480).jpg|thumb|U.S. cavalry attacking an Indian village]]\nFollowing Washita, Sheridan oversaw the refitting of the 19th Kansas and personally led them down the Washita River toward the Wichita Mountains. He met with Custer along the Washita River and they searched for Major Elliott's missing unit. They found the bodies of the missing unit and the bodies of Mrs. Blynn and her child who had been taken by Indians the previous summer near Fort Lyon.<ref name=\":1\" /> The defeat at Washita had scared many of the tribes and Sheridan was able to round up the majority of the Kiowa and Comanche people at Fort Cobb in December and get them to reservations. He began negotiations with Chief Little Robe of the Cheyennes and with [[Yellow Bear]] about living on the reservations.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Phil Sheridan and His Army.|last=Hutton|first=Paul|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|year=1985|isbn=|location=Lincoln Nebraska|pages=28\u2013120}}</ref> Sheridan then began the construction of Camp Sill, later called [[Fort Sill]], named after General Sill who died at [[Stones River National Battlefield|Stone River]].\n\nSheridan was called back to Washington following the election of [[Ulysses S. Grant|President Grant]]. He was informed of his promotion to lieutenant general of the army and reassigned from the department. Sheridan protested and was allowed to stay in Missouri with the rank of lieutenant general. The last remnants of Indian resistance came from Tall Bull Dog soldiers and elements of the [[Sioux]] and Northern Cheyenne tribes. The 5th Cavalry from [[Fort McPherson]] were sent to handle the situation on the Platte River in Nebraska. In May, the two forces collided at Summit Springs and the Indians were pursued out of the region. This brought an end to Sheridan's campaign, as the Indians had successfully been removed from the Platte and Arkansas and the majority of those in Kansas had been settled onto reservations. Sheridan left in 1869 to take command of the Army and was replaced by Major General Schofield.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n====Red Cloud's War and the Treaty of Fort Laramie====\n{{Main|Red Cloud's War|Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)}}\n\n====Black Hills War====\n[[File:Custer Staghounds.jpg|thumb|right|Custer and [[Bloody Knife]] (kneeling left), Custer's favorite [[United States Army Indian Scouts|Indian Scout]]]]\nIn 1875, the [[Great Sioux War of 1876\u201377]] erupted when the Dakota gold rush penetrated the [[Black Hills]]. The government decided to stop evicting trespassers from the Black Hills and offered to buy the land from the Sioux. When they refused, the government decided instead to take the land and gave the Lakota until January 31, 1876 to return to reservations. The tribes did not return to the reservations by the deadline, and Lt. Colonel [[George Custer]] found the main encampment of the Lakota and their allies at the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]]. Custer and his men were separated from their main body of troops, and they were all killed by the far more numerous Indians led by [[Crazy Horse]] and inspired by [[Sitting Bull]]'s earlier vision of victory. The [[Anheuser-Busch]] brewing company made prints of a dramatic painting that depicted \"Custer's Last Fight\" and had them framed and hung in many American saloons as an advertising campaign, helping to create a popular image of this battle.<ref>{{cite book| last = Griske| first = Michael| title = The Diaries of John Hunton| publisher = Heritage Books| year = 2005| pages = 78\u201379| isbn = 978-0-7884-3804-2 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anheuser-busch.com/historyOfMarketing.html|title=Community \u2013 Diversity |publisher=Anheuser-Busch |date= |accessdate=2011-05-28}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Woundedknee1891.jpg|thumb|right|Mass grave for the dead Lakota following the [[Wounded Knee Massacre]]]]\nThe Lakotas conducted a [[Ghost Dance]] ritual on the reservation at Wounded Knee, [[South Dakota]] in 1890, and the Army attempted to subdue them.

Maher took Don and me to dinner, confiding in us their hopes for this new institution that they, along with the Sisters of Mary of Namur, had founded. They wanted it to make a difference in America and the world. We saw that we shared with them a piety toward the ideals of our nation (a cast of mind already becoming rare) and a conviction that we were witnessing the end of a long cultural era. We all agreed that the hope for our national ideals and indeed the world lay in American education. Further, like them, we held the conviction that not a college, but only a very fine university, even if small, could make any difference in the nation\u2019s educational scheme.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nLouise Cowan described that unique curriculum that defined UD this way in the same 2006 speech to faculty \"We conceived of a Catholic university as an opportunity for generosity on the part of the Church\u2014the great texts from the past having been preserved in a Christian culture and now in danger again of being lost, a treasure trove as definite as the collection of art in the Vatican museum. And this meant, of course, that we conceived of a Catholic university\u2019s chief task as educational, not specifically religious. We all agreed\u2014the Bishop too, who had earned a doctoral degree at Louvain\u2014that the kind of liberal learning that had developed ex corde ecclesia was something the Church could offer a world much in need of it.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n\"Assured that we would have freedom to plan a curriculum if we came here, Don and I imagined what could be done with Catholic higher education. If we did cast our lot in with this new school, we made clear, it would have to be a real university\u2013one dedicated to liberal learning for all its students. The world did not need another moderately good college. We were eager to develop innovative programs that would give an entire school a genuine education, for we felt sure that such a curriculum would ignite sparks, spread into a kind of firestorm, and eventually illumine an entire nation. We had converted to Catholicism in 1956 and had both taught at [[Vanderbilt University]] before coming to TCU. Our ideas of education had been shaped by our friendship with the Southern Agrarians, along with study of Newman, Dawson, Maritain, Gilson, and intense reading in the brilliant theology of the forties and fifties\u2014de Lubac, Guardini, Sertillanges, Rahner, [[John Courtney Murray]]\u2014as well as C.S. Lewis and T.S. Eliot. All these writers were concerned with the relation of truth to culture. And all recognized that the culture we took for granted was in decline.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nLouise Cowan was hired that summer to run the English department and in that role she designed the Literary Tradition sequence of four courses which is at the heart of the text based core curriculum which developed in those first few years of the 1960s and which would go on to define a UD education thenceforth.\n\nDonald Cowan was also hired in 1959 to teach Physics.  At the end of the sixth year of the University, when the school's prominent though controversial 2nd President, Robert Morris, left UD, Dr. Donald Cowan was asked by the Board of Trustees to become the President of the college.\n\nFrom 1962 to his resignation in 1977, Donald Cowan was both the leader of UD and it defining force.  With his wife's charismatic personality and his collaboration with the Board of Trustees, the University of Dallas became a nationally prominent school especially in the world of classical learning and orthodox Catholic belief.\n\n\"Under Donald Cowan, the university set its mission as a place of intellectual inquiry rooted in Catholic philosophy and a spiritual world view\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dmagazine.com/publications/d-magazine/1996/march/wanted-a-new-president-for-ud/|title=Wanted: A New President for UD - D Magazine|work=D Magazine|access-date=2017-04-18|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nIn their years together at UD, the Cowans cultivated relationships among Dallas' rich and powerful citizens very well.  Though some occasionally considered the reverence given to the Cowans by high society to be a little too strong, few would dispute that the Cowans left a mark both on the college and on Dallas society that lasted long after their official leadership ended in the late 1970s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dmagazine.com/publications/d-magazine/1979/may/the-prime-of-louise-cowan/|title=The Prime of Louise Cowan - D Magazine|work=D Magazine|access-date=2017-04-18|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nAfter the resignation of Don Cowan in 1977, there was a period of about a decade where the Cowans did not have any role at UD, but they returned in 1989 and Louise resumed to teaching a class in the Russian Novel and advising graduate students in the Braniff Graduate School.  Donald Cowan was less visible in those years leading up to his death in 2002.

Haggerty Art Village is separated from the rest of campus by a wooded grove, and the social atmosphere around the village is considerably different from the rest of the university. One notable feature of the graduate art program is that it provides all accepted graduates a full tuition scholarship, allowing them to study for three years and receive both their MA and MFA degrees.\n\n'''Offerings'''\n<br/>Haggerty Art Village itself features printmaking (all forms, plus papermaking and letterpress studios), painting, sculpture (well-equipped and spacious woodworking and metalworking studios), and ceramics facilities, though graduate students are not bound to a single medium, and receive their degree as a broader \"art\" classification (despite this, students are required to choose an adviser, based on which medium they might employ the most). There is also a Mac lab for digital photography and web design seminars. The program is small and intimate, and allows students to exhibit work both on and off campus. University of Dallas MFA candidates typically go on to successful artistic careers nationwide, and students come from a variety of backgrounds (there have also been numerous international students). Each student receives a private studio space in a collective studio environment. At this time, there are 16 graduate art students, indicative of the competitive nature of the acceptance process. In addition to flexible studio art courses and independent studio work, graduate art students are required to fulfill numerous art seminar credits, as well as take four art history courses throughout their time at UD (modern and contemporary art, plus two others; many students choose to create their own independent coursework). Because the UD art faculty are linked to the Dallas - Ft. Worth arts community, there are often graduate field trips to various Dallas - Ft. Worth art institutions, such as the Nasher Sculpture Center, the Dallas Museum of Art, the Modern in Ft. Worth, and several others.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n'''Beatrice Haggerty'''\n<br/> The University's gallery is named after [[Beatrice Haggerty]] who was influential in forming the Art Village. Haggerty's involvement with the art program emerged from a personal need when her daughter Kathleen was seriously injured in an auto accident. The Haggerty gift of the first art building in 1960 was engineered for her therapy. At the time Dallas was not highly developed, so Haggerty suggested to her husband [[Patrick E. Haggerty]] that the new university could benefit by a small building for sculpture. In return, their daughter had access to the needed therapeutic work. Giving an alternative opportunity of recovery for her daughter, Beatrice Haggerty simultaneously cultivated partnerships and future opportunity for the university's art program to flourish. After the completion of the [[Patrick and Beatrice Haggerty Museum of Art]] in Wisconsin, Haggerty again donated to fund the building of the first art building at the University of Dallas in 1960. It is currently one of six structures that make up the Haggerty Art Village. \nIn 1994 a \u201cBelong, Believe, Become\u201d campaign was launched to fund the completion of the entire art village. Haggerty promised the \u201cseed money,\u201d remarking: \u201cI would like to see the art center finished.\u201d The funds would renovate the older art buildings and add a multipurpose art history building, a new sculpture facility, and an art foundations building. This donation served the first part of the 125 million dollar campus wide aid campaign. \nThe original investments of the Haggerty family helped to establish a respectful, healthy, safe environment that promotes the values of quality and creativity in the visual communication of artist and their art. As a prominent member of gardening clubs and possessing an eye for aesthetic landscaping, Beatrice advocated to uphold the natural beauty of the campus\u2019 trees and to maintain an environment for all artists to find inspiration. Currently, the exhibitions in the [[Beatrice M. Haggerty Gallery]] are designed to encourage a dialogue between the University of Dallas and the broader artistic community by inviting an array of contemporary artists, both national and international, to the university's campus.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Novinski|first1=Lyle|title=Personal Notes: on Pat Haggerty|date=2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Novinski|first1=Lyle|title=Personal Notes: The Haggerty Art Village|date=2017}}</ref>\n\n'''O'Neil Ford Buildings'''\n<br/>The first University of Dallas art building was completed in 1960 through the benevolence of Mr. and Mrs. [[Patrick E. Haggerty]]. The objective was to create a space that would allow artists to be cultivated and challenged. Designed by [[O'Neil Ford]] and his firm Ford, Powell and Carson of San Antonio, the associated architects Landry and Landry of Dallas, the building is separate from the rest of campus by a wooded grove. Using simple materials, the building features both exhibition and gathering spaces with high ceilings and natural light. To further encourage the making of art, the building includes three, semi private studios. This first building was opened in 1960 and was dedicated by the Bishop of Dallas, most Reverend Thomas K. Gorman, and attended by Sr.[[Mary Corita Kent]], renowned contemporary print-maker from Immaculate Heart College in Los Angeles\nIn 1965, the University of Dallas welcomed its second art building designed by Ford. This building provided studios and a frame shop for both painting and printmaking studios.\nIn 1975, a third art building designed by Ford was established. The space was created for both ceramics and graduate studios. Additionally, the building served as a printmaking expansion, drawing room, and art history classroom and kiln shed.\nThese buildings were the first of six structures to form the Haggerty Art Village.\n\nO'Neil Ford also designed the main buildings on the Mall of the university.  Those buildings, built thanks to the large gift in 1964 from Mr. Blakely and Mr. Braniff, and the tower on the end of the mall built later were designed by Mr. Ford to be both typical of the architecture of the American Southwest and were built using stronger and more durable building methods than most modern construction.\n\n[[File:AroundTheArtVillage2.jpeg|thumb|left|A view of the printmaking studios through a grove of trees, Haggerty Art Village, University of Dallas, Texas]]\n'''Galleries'''\n<br/>Haggerty Art Village features the Upper Gallery, which can be merged for one, large exhibition, or separated into two distinct exhibitions. The Upper Gallery is fully equipped with track lighting and movable walls. Many students show in the Upper Gallery for their MA on-campus exhibitions. In addition to the Upper Gallery, there is a small studio space gallery, which usually shows group exhibitions featuring recent graduate work. The art history building features the [[Beatrice M. Haggerty Gallery]], which hosts an eclectic array of exhibits, featuring works by artists from around the United States and the rest of the world. There are other places outside of the Art Village to show work: Gorman Lecture Center Foyer is commonly used, as is the Braniff Lounge (called \"the fishbowl\" by students for its many windows and natural light).{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n'''National Print Invitational'''\n\nStarted by Juergen Strunck in 1974, the National Print Invitational was an annual exhibit that allowed printmakers from all over the US to share their work without paying entry fees. With no fee, a couple hundred submissions were narrowed down to roughly 50 by the university printmaking graduate students.\n\nAfter the initial $2000 university funding was spent and not replenished, continued fundraising was mostly accomplished through membership fees: for $200 a year, members received a print as well as funded future exhibits.<ref>Interview with Juergen Strunck</ref>\n\nWith Strunck\u2019s retirement, the National Print Invitational ended after many successful years of supporting not only artists in the immediate community, but nationally as well. Hardcopies of all invites are located in the Matrix and Printmaking Collection in the Beatrice M. Haggerty Gallery, with the exception of the first NPI, which does not have an invite.\n\n'''Matrix Program'''\nThe Matrix Program invites visiting artists from around the country. It allows students to print an edition of that artist's work. Artists have included [[Endi E. Poskovic]]. Students who participate in printing the edition typically receive a finished, numbered print to add to their personal print collection. Matrix donors feature several citizens of the [[Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex]] community appreciative of the arts. For their donations, they receive a print by every other Matrix artist (Matrix artists are divided into \"small edition\" and \"large edition\" semesters; donors receive \"large edition\" prints). The program also features a student-curated exhibition of the artists' work, complete with an opening reception and an artist demo session.\n\n'''NCECA Conference'''\n<br/>The University of Dallas was the local sponsor for the [[National Council on Education for the Ceramic Arts]]' (NCECA) 32nd annual Conference in 1998 with the central theme of \u201cHeroes, Icons, History, Memory.\u201d The University\u2019s [[Dan Hammett]] acted as the [[Dallas\u2013Fort Worth]] Onsite Conference Chair and has served the organization in various capacities for seventeen years.<ref name=\"Lyle Novinski 2017. pp. 22\">Interview with Lyle Novinski. \"Notes on the History of the Art Department Graduate Program\". 2017. pp. 22</ref> A Clay Traditions exhibition appeared in conjunction with the March Conference, promoting the mission of ceramic education.<ref name=\"udallas.edu\">{{cite web|url=https://www.udallas.edu/constantin/academics/programs/art/ceramics/nceca.php|title=NCECA|website=Udallas.edu}}</ref> Instructors from various institutions combined the different roles of teacher and artist, providing a cross section of contemporary work in clay. The University started the ceramic exhibition and elevated the Conference's visibility through exhibitions and P.B.S. style films released throughout the country.<ref name=\"Lyle Novinski 2017. pp. 22\"/> In all, three exhibitions<ref name=\"Lyle Novinski 2017. pp. 20\">Interview with Lyle Novinski. \"Notes on the History of the Art Department Graduate Program\". 2017. pp. 20</ref> were presented on the campus to make available the visual icons of the organization to students.<ref name=\"udallas.edu\"/> Hammett mounted the work of Professor [[Harding Black]], a regionally respected Texas artist, in upstairs Haggar; the work of [[Maria Martinez]], an artist from New Mexico; and a national Student Competition in the University Gallery in Haggar which no longer exists.<ref name=\"Lyle Novinski 2017. pp. 20\"/> On the Irving Campus by the Madonna Pond, the Constantin Arch serves as a continuing testament to the organization. Designer Robert Harrison constructed the brick, cement, steel, and ceramic tile structure over four days with University art professors, Dan Hammett and [[Cameron Schoepp]], and students.<ref>\"University of Dallas Magazine\" Spring/Summer 1998, pp. 8</ref> Hammett's position on the national Board of NCECA has been beneficial for the Graduate and undergraduate ceramic students, whom he takes to the national Conference each year.\n\n'''The Celebration of Japanese Arts'''\nThe university agreed to house one of the most renowned and respected swordsmiths in Japan in the spring of 1980.  Master Yoshindo Yoshihara hoped to come to the United States and demonstrate how blades were forged and ultimately produce the first Samurai blades forged in the Western Hemisphere.  In the early spring of 1980, the garden between the art buildings was transformed into a Japanese setting with plants and a gravel surface to welcome the guests.  The project began on Holy Saturday, after the lighting of the fire of sacramental order.  Yoshihara, inside the Kaji-Ba, struck the first fire with flint and steel at the forge, and began with raw ore that had been transported from Japan. Along with Yoshihara and his assistants there was also a hibaki maker, grinder, and a polisher.  The scabbard and hibaki makers sat on tatami mats inside the sculpture studio, which is currently the printmaking studio at the university.  16 blades were completed, and three from raw ore.  One is in the Metropolitan, one in Boston, and the third in on the University of Dallas Campus.   A week long Shinsa was offered in upstairs Haggar. Here the blades made by Yoshihara were evaluated and approved for transportation.\nAlong with the smithing, The Samurai Sword Museum in Kyoto offered to send an exhibition of spear heads, blades, kutani, and Tsuba.  The University also housed an exhibition of Japanese ceramics in the Art building.  The blades were displayed in the University Gallery, located then where the student life offices are now. They were considered so valuable that they were guarded during the day. So precious were they that no catalogue or identifying labels were permitted.  The oldest was 10th century.\nAlso offered in the Campus wide Celebration of the Japanese Arts was a tea ceremony, flower arranging, and kite flying. Among the UD Community Education programs was an eight-week instructional class on \"Beginning Ikebana Japanese Floral Art\" along with a four-week lecture series on \"Zen and Contemporary American Literature\" and an eight-week lecture series on \"Treasures of Japanese Civilization.\"  A 30-minute, 16mm film \u201c Samurai\u201d was made by Lowell Jordan that shows the process of the forging of the blades on the University campus.  The film was shown on PBS and also won a silver medal at an International film Festival.\n\n===Media===\nThe University of Dallas' student newspaper is ''The University News'' and its yearbook is ''The Crusader''. The ''University News'' is published weekly on Wednesdays.\n\n===Residence life===\nOn campus residency is required of all students who have not yet attained senior status or who are under 21 and are not married, not a veteran of the military or who do not live with their parents or relatives in the [[Dallas \u2013 Fort Worth Metroplex|Dallas-Fort Worth]] area. These requirements change from year to year depending upon the size of the incoming freshman class; for instance, in 2009, all students with senior credit standing were required to live off campus. Freshmen live in traditional single-sex halls, while upperclassmen live either in co-ed dormitories or off-campus.\n\nThere are five traditional halls. Jerome, Augustine and Gregory halls are all-female halls. These halls were last renovated in 1998, 1995, and 2014 respectively. Theresa and Madonna halls are all-male halls. These halls were renovated in 2000 and 2014 respectively. Clark Hall is the only co-ed dormitory and was built in 2010. The final hall is O'Connell hall. Renovated in 2010, O'Connell hall housing is based upon campus population housing needs for any given year. This hall may house new students, continuing students or a combination of both by floor if necessary.\n\n===Cost of Attendance===\nThe cost of attendance for the University of Dallas is dependent on the student's commuter status. For an on-campus student, the cost of attendance for the 2019-2020 school year is $59,600. For an off-campus resident in Texas, the cost of attendance for the 2019-2020 school year is $55,640. For a student living with parents or relatives, the cost of attendance for the 2019-2020 school year is $51,340.<ref name=\"Cost of Attendance\">{{cite web|url=https://udallas.edu/offices/finaid/undergrad-fa/udergrad-cost-attend/index.php|title=Cost|website=Udallas.edu}}</ref>\n\n==Notable people==\n<!---needs citations to tie notable person to school per [[WP:NLIST]] & [[WP:LISTPEOPLE]]--->\n\n===Alumni===\n\nNotable alumni include:\n\n====Intellectuals, artists and entertainers====\n*[[Larry Arnhart]] - Political theorist\n*[[Jeffrey Bishop]] - Philosopher, physician and bioethicist (Director of the [[Albert Gnaegi Center for Health Care Ethics]]) at [[St. Louis University]]\n*[[L.

In a 2006 speech, [[Louise Cowan]] related the encounter this way: \"When this University was completing its third year, and Gene Constantin, Ed Maher, Bishop Gorman, and Msgr. Maher took Don and me to dinner, confiding in us their hopes for this new institution that they, along with the Sisters of Mary of Namur, had founded. They wanted it to make a difference in America and the world. We saw that we shared with them a piety toward the ideals of our nation (a cast of mind already becoming rare) and a conviction that we were witnessing the end of a long cultural era. We all agreed that the hope for our national ideals and indeed the world lay in American education. Further, like them, we held the conviction that not a college, but only a very fine university, even if small, could make any difference in the nation\u2019s educational scheme.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nLouise Cowan described that unique curriculum that defined UD this way in the same 2006 speech to faculty \"We conceived of a Catholic university as an opportunity for generosity on the part of the Church\u2014the great texts from the past having been preserved in a Christian culture and now in danger again of being lost, a treasure trove as definite as the collection of art in the Vatican museum. And this meant, of course, that we conceived of a Catholic university\u2019s chief task as educational, not specifically religious. We all agreed\u2014the Bishop too, who had earned a doctoral degree at Louvain\u2014that the kind of liberal learning that had developed ex corde ecclesia was something the Church could offer a world much in need of it.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n\"Assured that we would have freedom to plan a curriculum if we came here, Don and I imagined what could be done with Catholic higher education. If we did cast our lot in with this new school, we made clear, it would have to be a real university\u2013one dedicated to liberal learning for all its students. The world did not need another moderately good college. We were eager to develop innovative programs that would give an entire school a genuine education, for we felt sure that such a curriculum would ignite sparks, spread into a kind of firestorm, and eventually illumine an entire nation. We had converted to Catholicism in 1956 and had both taught at [[Vanderbilt University]] before coming to TCU. Our ideas of education had been shaped by our friendship with the Southern Agrarians, along with study of Newman, Dawson, Maritain, Gilson, and intense reading in the brilliant theology of the forties and fifties\u2014de Lubac, Guardini, Sertillanges, Rahner, [[John Courtney Murray]]\u2014as well as C.S. Lewis and T.S. Eliot. All these writers were concerned with the relation of truth to culture. And all recognized that the culture we took for granted was in decline.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nLouise Cowan was hired that summer to run the English department and in that role she designed the Literary Tradition sequence of four courses which is at the heart of the text based core curriculum which developed in those first few years of the 1960s and which would go on to define a UD education thenceforth.\n\nDonald Cowan was also hired in 1959 to teach Physics.  At the end of the sixth year of the University, when the school's prominent though controversial 2nd President, Robert Morris, left UD, Dr. Donald Cowan was asked by the Board of Trustees to become the President of the college.\n\nFrom 1962 to his resignation in 1977, Donald Cowan was both the leader of UD and it defining force.  With his wife's charismatic personality and his collaboration with the Board of Trustees, the University of Dallas became a nationally prominent school especially in the world of classical learning and orthodox Catholic belief.\n\n\"Under Donald Cowan, the university set its mission as a place of intellectual inquiry rooted in Catholic philosophy and a spiritual world view\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dmagazine.com/publications/d-magazine/1996/march/wanted-a-new-president-for-ud/|title=Wanted: A New President for UD - D Magazine|work=D Magazine|access-date=2017-04-18|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nIn their years together at UD, the Cowans cultivated relationships among Dallas' rich and powerful citizens very well.  Though some occasionally considered the reverence given to the Cowans by high society to be a little too strong, few would dispute that the Cowans left a mark both on the college and on Dallas society that lasted long after their official leadership ended in the late 1970s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dmagazine.com/publications/d-magazine/1979/may/the-prime-of-louise-cowan/|title=The Prime of Louise Cowan - D Magazine|work=D Magazine|access-date=2017-04-18|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nAfter the resignation of Don Cowan in 1977, there was a period of about a decade where the Cowans did not have any role at UD, but they returned in 1989 and Louise resumed to teaching a class in the Russian Novel and advising graduate students in the Braniff Graduate School.

Haggerty Art Village is separated from the rest of campus by a wooded grove, and the social atmosphere around the village is considerably different from the rest of the university. One notable feature of the graduate art program is that it provides all accepted graduates a full tuition scholarship, allowing them to study for three years and receive both their MA and MFA degrees.\n\n'''Offerings'''\n<br/>Haggerty Art Village itself features printmaking (all forms, plus papermaking and letterpress studios), painting, sculpture (well-equipped and spacious woodworking and metalworking studios), and ceramics facilities, though graduate students are not bound to a single medium, and receive their degree as a broader \"art\" classification (despite this, students are required to choose an adviser, based on which medium they might employ the most). There is also a Mac lab for digital photography and web design seminars. The program is small and intimate, and allows students to exhibit work both on and off campus. University of Dallas MFA candidates typically go on to successful artistic careers nationwide, and students come from a variety of backgrounds (there have also been numerous international students). Each student receives a private studio space in a collective studio environment. At this time, there are 16 graduate art students, indicative of the competitive nature of the acceptance process. In addition to flexible studio art courses and independent studio work, graduate art students are required to fulfill numerous art seminar credits, as well as take four art history courses throughout their time at UD (modern and contemporary art, plus two others; many students choose to create their own independent coursework). Because the UD art faculty are linked to the Dallas - Ft. Worth arts community, there are often graduate field trips to various Dallas - Ft. Worth art institutions, such as the Nasher Sculpture Center, the Dallas Museum of Art, the Modern in Ft. Worth, and several others.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n'''Beatrice Haggerty'''\n<br/> The University's gallery is named after [[Beatrice Haggerty]] who was influential in forming the Art Village. Haggerty's involvement with the art program emerged from a personal need when her daughter Kathleen was seriously injured in an auto accident. The Haggerty gift of the first art building in 1960 was engineered for her therapy. At the time Dallas was not highly developed, so Haggerty suggested to her husband [[Patrick E. Haggerty]] that the new university could benefit by a small building for sculpture. In return, their daughter had access to the needed therapeutic work. Giving an alternative opportunity of recovery for her daughter, Beatrice Haggerty simultaneously cultivated partnerships and future opportunity for the university's art program to flourish. After the completion of the [[Patrick and Beatrice Haggerty Museum of Art]] in Wisconsin, Haggerty again donated to fund the building of the first art building at the University of Dallas in 1960. It is currently one of six structures that make up the Haggerty Art Village. \nIn 1994 a \u201cBelong, Believe, Become\u201d campaign was launched to fund the completion of the entire art village. Haggerty promised the \u201cseed money,\u201d remarking: \u201cI would like to see the art center finished.\u201d The funds would renovate the older art buildings and add a multipurpose art history building, a new sculpture facility, and an art foundations building. This donation served the first part of the 125 million dollar campus wide aid campaign. \nThe original investments of the Haggerty family helped to establish a respectful, healthy, safe environment that promotes the values of quality and creativity in the visual communication of artist and their art. As a prominent member of gardening clubs and possessing an eye for aesthetic landscaping, Beatrice advocated to uphold the natural beauty of the campus\u2019 trees and to maintain an environment for all artists to find inspiration. Currently, the exhibitions in the [[Beatrice M. Haggerty Gallery]] are designed to encourage a dialogue between the University of Dallas and the broader artistic community by inviting an array of contemporary artists, both national and international, to the university's campus.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Novinski|first1=Lyle|title=Personal Notes: on Pat Haggerty|date=2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Novinski|first1=Lyle|title=Personal Notes: The Haggerty Art Village|date=2017}}</ref>\n\n'''O'Neil Ford Buildings'''\n<br/>The first University of Dallas art building was completed in 1960 through the benevolence of Mr. and Mrs. [[Patrick E. Haggerty]]. The objective was to create a space that would allow artists to be cultivated and challenged. Designed by [[O'Neil Ford]] and his firm Ford, Powell and Carson of San Antonio, the associated architects Landry and Landry of Dallas, the building is separate from the rest of campus by a wooded grove. Using simple materials, the building features both exhibition and gathering spaces with high ceilings and natural light. To further encourage the making of art, the building includes three, semi private studios. This first building was opened in 1960 and was dedicated by the Bishop of Dallas, most Reverend Thomas K. Gorman, and attended by Sr.[[Mary Corita Kent]], renowned contemporary print-maker from Immaculate Heart College in Los Angeles\nIn 1965, the University of Dallas welcomed its second art building designed by Ford. This building provided studios and a frame shop for both painting and printmaking studios.\nIn 1975, a third art building designed by Ford was established. The space was created for both ceramics and graduate studios. Additionally, the building served as a printmaking expansion, drawing room, and art history classroom and kiln shed.\nThese buildings were the first of six structures to form the Haggerty Art Village.\n\nO'Neil Ford also designed the main buildings on the Mall of the university.  Those buildings, built thanks to the large gift in 1964 from Mr. Blakely and Mr. Braniff, and the tower on the end of the mall built later were designed by Mr. Ford to be both typical of the architecture of the American Southwest and were built using stronger and more durable building methods than most modern construction.\n\n[[File:AroundTheArtVillage2.jpeg|thumb|left|A view of the printmaking studios through a grove of trees, Haggerty Art Village, University of Dallas, Texas]]\n'''Galleries'''\n<br/>Haggerty Art Village features the Upper Gallery, which can be merged for one, large exhibition, or separated into two distinct exhibitions. The Upper Gallery is fully equipped with track lighting and movable walls. Many students show in the Upper Gallery for their MA on-campus exhibitions. In addition to the Upper Gallery, there is a small studio space gallery, which usually shows group exhibitions featuring recent graduate work. The art history building features the [[Beatrice M. Haggerty Gallery]], which hosts an eclectic array of exhibits, featuring works by artists from around the United States and the rest of the world. There are other places outside of the Art Village to show work: Gorman Lecture Center Foyer is commonly used, as is the Braniff Lounge (called \"the fishbowl\" by students for its many windows and natural light).{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n'''National Print Invitational'''\n\nStarted by Juergen Strunck in 1974, the National Print Invitational was an annual exhibit that allowed printmakers from all over the US to share their work without paying entry fees. With no fee, a couple hundred submissions were narrowed down to roughly 50 by the university printmaking graduate students.\n\nAfter the initial $2000 university funding was spent and not replenished, continued fundraising was mostly accomplished through membership fees: for $200 a year, members received a print as well as funded future exhibits.<ref>Interview with Juergen Strunck</ref>\n\nWith Strunck\u2019s retirement, the National Print Invitational ended after many successful years of supporting not only artists in the immediate community, but nationally as well. Hardcopies of all invites are located in the Matrix and Printmaking Collection in the Beatrice M. Haggerty Gallery, with the exception of the first NPI, which does not have an invite.\n\n'''Matrix Program'''\nThe Matrix Program invites visiting artists from around the country. It allows students to print an edition of that artist's work. Artists have included [[Endi E. Poskovic]]. Students who participate in printing the edition typically receive a finished, numbered print to add to their personal print collection. Matrix donors feature several citizens of the [[Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex]] community appreciative of the arts. For their donations, they receive a print by every other Matrix artist (Matrix artists are divided into \"small edition\" and \"large edition\" semesters; donors receive \"large edition\" prints). The program also features a student-curated exhibition of the artists' work, complete with an opening reception and an artist demo session.\n\n'''NCECA Conference'''\n<br/>The University of Dallas was the local sponsor for the [[National Council on Education for the Ceramic Arts]]' (NCECA) 32nd annual Conference in 1998 with the central theme of \u201cHeroes, Icons, History, Memory.\u201d The University\u2019s [[Dan Hammett]] acted as the [[Dallas\u2013Fort Worth]] Onsite Conference Chair and has served the organization in various capacities for seventeen years.<ref name=\"Lyle Novinski 2017. pp. 22\">Interview with Lyle Novinski. \"Notes on the History of the Art Department Graduate Program\". 2017. pp. 22</ref> A Clay Traditions exhibition appeared in conjunction with the March Conference, promoting the mission of ceramic education.<ref name=\"udallas.edu\">{{cite web|url=https://www.udallas.edu/constantin/academics/programs/art/ceramics/nceca.php|title=NCECA|website=Udallas.edu}}</ref> Instructors from various institutions combined the different roles of teacher and artist, providing a cross section of contemporary work in clay.

Master Yoshindo Yoshihara hoped to come to the United States and demonstrate how blades were forged and ultimately produce the first Samurai blades forged in the Western Hemisphere.  In the early spring of 1980, the garden between the art buildings was transformed into a Japanese setting with plants and a gravel surface to welcome the guests.  The project began on Holy Saturday, after the lighting of the fire of sacramental order.  Yoshihara, inside the Kaji-Ba, struck the first fire with flint and steel at the forge, and began with raw ore that had been transported from Japan. Along with Yoshihara and his assistants there was also a hibaki maker, grinder, and a polisher.  The scabbard and hibaki makers sat on tatami mats inside the sculpture studio, which is currently the printmaking studio at the university.  16 blades were completed, and three from raw ore.  One is in the Metropolitan, one in Boston, and the third in on the University of Dallas Campus.   A week long Shinsa was offered in upstairs Haggar. Here the blades made by Yoshihara were evaluated and approved for transportation.\nAlong with the smithing, The Samurai Sword Museum in Kyoto offered to send an exhibition of spear heads, blades, kutani, and Tsuba.  The University also housed an exhibition of Japanese ceramics in the Art building.  The blades were displayed in the University Gallery, located then where the student life offices are now. They were considered so valuable that they were guarded during the day. So precious were they that no catalogue or identifying labels were permitted.  The oldest was 10th century.\nAlso offered in the Campus wide Celebration of the Japanese Arts was a tea ceremony, flower arranging, and kite flying. Among the UD Community Education programs was an eight-week instructional class on \"Beginning Ikebana Japanese Floral Art\" along with a four-week lecture series on \"Zen and Contemporary American Literature\" and an eight-week lecture series on \"Treasures of Japanese Civilization.\"  A 30-minute, 16mm film \u201c Samurai\u201d was made by Lowell Jordan that shows the process of the forging of the blades on the University campus.  The film was shown on PBS and also won a silver medal at an International film Festival.\n\n===Media===\nThe University of Dallas' student newspaper is ''The University News'' and its yearbook is ''The Crusader''. The ''University News'' is published weekly on Wednesdays.\n\n===Residence life===\nOn campus residency is required of all students who have not yet attained senior status or who are under 21 and are not married, not a veteran of the military or who do not live with their parents or relatives in the [[Dallas \u2013 Fort Worth Metroplex|Dallas-Fort Worth]] area. These requirements change from year to year depending upon the size of the incoming freshman class; for instance, in 2009, all students with senior credit standing were required to live off campus. Freshmen live in traditional single-sex halls, while upperclassmen live either in co-ed dormitories or off-campus.\n\nThere are five traditional halls. Jerome, Augustine and Gregory halls are all-female halls. These halls were last renovated in 1998, 1995, and 2014 respectively. Theresa and Madonna halls are all-male halls. These halls were renovated in 2000 and 2014 respectively. Clark Hall is the only co-ed dormitory and was built in 2010. The final hall is O'Connell hall.

It is in [[H\u00f6xter (district)|H\u00f6xter]] district and [[Detmold (region)|Detmold]] region. Warburg is the midpoint in the ''Warburger B\u00f6rde''. Since March 2012 the city is allowed to call 'Hanseatic City Warburg'.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Blick vom Desenberg \u00fcber Warburg (10573190534).jpg|thumb|right|Warburg as seen from the Desenberg]]\nThe main town, consisting of the Old Town (''Altstadt'') and the New Town (''Neustadt'') and bearing the same name as the whole town, is a hill town. While the Old Town lies in the Diemel Valley, the New Town rises on the heights above the Diemel. The Warburg municipal area borders in the west on the [[Sauerland]] and in the northwest on the [[Eggegebirge]] foothills, while in the north and northeast the ''Warburger B\u00f6rde'' abuts the town and in the south stretches the Diemel Valley.\n\n=== Constituent communities ===\n[[File:WeldaOstWestDirection.jpg|thumb|right|The constituent community [[Welda]]]]\nWarburg consists of the following 16 centres:\n* Bonenburg (1,107 inhabitants)\n* Calenberg (459 inhabitants)\n* Dalheim (95 inhabitants)\n* Daseburg (1,354 inhabitants)\n* [[D\u00f6ssel]] (651 inhabitants)\n* Germete (997 inhabitants)\n* Herlinghausen (446 inhabitants)\n* Hohenwepel (683 inhabitants)\n* Menne (846 inhabitants)\n* N\u00f6rde (780 inhabitants)\n* Ossendorf (1,332 inhabitants)\n* Rimbeck (1,603 inhabitants)\n* Scherfede (3,105 inhabitants)\n* Warburg (10,663 inhabitants)\n* [[Welda]] (889 inhabitants)\n* Wormeln (652 inhabitants)\n\n== History ==\n{{Infobox country\n|native_name            = ''Freie Reichsstadt Warburg''\n|conventional_long_name = Imperial Free City of Warburg\n|common_name            = Warburg\n|\n|era                    = Middle Ages\n|status                 = City-state\n|empire                 = Holy Roman Empire\n|government_type        = Republic\n|\n|year_start             = 10th century\n|year_end               = 1802\n|\n|event_start            = Old Town founded\n|date_start             = before 1036\n|event1                 = [[Personal union]] with<br>{{spaces|4}}[[Prince-Bishopric of Paderborn|Bp Paderborn]]\n|date_event1            = <br>1020s\n|event2                 = [[Imperial immediacy]]\n|date_event2            = 1180\n|event3                 = Joined [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic Lg.]]\n|date_event3            = 1364\n|event4                 = [[Thirty Years' War|Annexed]] to [[Duchy of Brunswick|Brunswick]]\n|date_event4            = 1622\u201348\n|event_end              = [[German Mediatisation|Mediatised]] to [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]\n|date_end               = \n|event_post             = Annexed to [[Kingdom of Westphalia|Westphalia]]\n|date_post              = 1807\u201315\n|\n|p1                     = \n|image_p1               = \n|s1                     = Kingdom of Prussia\n|flag_s1                = Flag of the Kingdom of Prussia (1750-1801).svg\n|\n|capital                = <nowiki>Warburg</nowiki>\n|\n|footnotes              = \n}}\n\n=== Prehistory ===\nIn the [[4th millennium BC]], there was a [[megalith]] culture in the Warburg area.\n\n=== Protohistory ===\nIn the 1st century AD, there were [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] settlers south of the Desenberg.\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nIn the 8th century, there was a Saxon noble seat west of the town. In the 8th and 9th centuries came the [[Christianization]] of the [[Saxons]] in the Diemel area.\n\nThe name Warburg was first mentioned in a document sometime around 1010, although [[archaeology|archaeological]] finds have established that there were already people living in what is now Warburg by [[protohistory|protohistoric]] times. The first definite documentary mention came in 1036.\n[[File:Warburg Altstadt.jpg|thumb|293x293px|Old-Town Warburg with view to the Lutheran Church]]\nIn the 11th century there was on the ''Warburger Burgberg'' (\"Castle Mountain\") the \"Wartburg\", under whose protection people came and settled. The castle was at first owned by Count Dodiko, whose estate, according to documents, passed in 1020 to the [[Bishop of Paderborn]] when the Count's only son met his end in an accident. Eventually, sometime between 1021 and 1033, the Emperor further granted to the bishop the Count's rights. About 1180, the Old Town was granted town rights.\n\nFrom the castle hill, there was a good view over the Diemel Valley, such that a close watch could be kept on the [[ford (crossing)|ford]] that merchants had to cross going to Warburg and [[Paderborn]]. This ford on the Diemel was a crossroads of several ancient commercial roads and was crucial in the town's development into a central place. The Warburg New Town was founded in 1228\u201329 by [[Bernhard IV. zur Lippe]], Bishop of Paderborn, to bolster his political position in the Diemel area against encroachment by the [[Bishop of Cologne]]. About 1239, the New Town had been built into a complete town in its own right, and the townsfolk there had full civil rights after the [[Dortmund]] and [[Marsberg]] models. In 1260, the New Town was granted the right to build a town wall, not only against armies from afar, but even \u2013 expressly \u2013 against the Old Town.\n\nIn 1364, both the Old Town and the New Town became members of the [[Hanseatic League]]. By 1436, they had forgotten their differences, uniting that year into one town.\n\n==== Unification of the two towns ====\n[[File:Gipsabdruck Warburger Neustadt, Der Grote Breff von 1436.jpg|thumb|left|Plaster stamp of the seal of Warburg New Town under the constitutional document \"Der Grote Breff\" from 1436]]\nThe two towns, the Old Town and the New Town, joined in 1436 into one town. In ''Der Grote Breff'' (\"The Great Letter\"), the newly united town's constitution was precisely framed and sealed. Both former towns' seals are to be seen on the Great Letter. On the cast seal (in the picture), two defensive towers with a double wall are to be seen. Under the town gate stands the Bishop of Paderborn with a staff. The circumscription reads: ''\"Sigillium burgensium in wartborch\"''. The Great Letter is written in [[Middle Low German]], the Hanseatic League's language, and stands as a substantial legal document.\n[[File:Warburg-Blick-auf-Rathaus-Neustadtkirche.jpg|thumb|Town Hall ''Between the Towns'' in Warburg, built in 1568]]\nHitherto, the Old Town's and the New Town's council meetings had each been taking place in their respective town halls, each on their respective marketplaces. Now, however, there were two [[mayor]]s. This was solved by allowing each mayor to head the unified town for half the year. Furthermore, both town halls were used for council meetings, again, each for half the year. However, the problem of having two town halls was not fully resolved until 132 years after the two former towns had merged. Only then, in 1568, was the new ''Rathaus Zwischen den St\u00e4dten'' \u2013 Town Hall Between the Towns \u2013 built.\n\nThe common Town Hall, in the form of preserved [[Renaissance]] buildings, was built right on the former boundary between the two former towns, with two separate entrances for ''Altst\u00e4dter'' and ''Neust\u00e4dter'' (\"Old Towners\" and \"New Towners\"). In 1902\u201303, it was expanded with a [[Timber framing|half-timbered]] floor. It stands right where a gate, the ''Liebfrauentor'' (roughly, \"Gate of Our Lady\"), once stood. In the Middle Ages, this was the only gateway between the two then separate towns.\n\nThe Old Town's former Town Hall, renovated in 1973, nowadays serves [[gastronomy|gastronomical]] and residential ends. The New Town's former Town Hall served various purposes ranging from Town Hall cellar to assembly hall to market hall before it had to be torn down in 1803 owing to decrepitude.\n\nThere arose yet another superfluous government building in 1975 after the communities of the old ''[[Amt (subnational entity)|Amt]]'' of Warburg-Land were amalgamated with Warburg, namely the ''Amt'' administration building on Kasseler Stra\u00dfe, which was forsaken by the district authorities in favour of the ''Beh\u00f6rdenhaus'' (\"Authority House\") on Bahnhofstra\u00dfe.\n\n=== Modern times ===\n[[File:Merian, Matth\u00e4us - Topographia Westphaliae - Warburgum, 1647.jpg|thumb|[[Matth\u00e4us Merian]]: ''Warburgum''. Engraving from the ''Topographia Westphaliae'' from 1647]]\nIn the early 17th century, Warburg was a well known and rich trading town. Outside the town walls rose \"die H\u00fcffert\" as a new part of the town. In the [[Thirty Years' War]], great parts of die H\u00fcffert and other villages in the area were sacked and destroyed, impoverishing the town. In 1622, the town was captured by [[Christian the Younger of Brunswick, Bishop of Halberstadt]], who is sometimes called in [[German language|German]] ''der tolle Christian'' \u2013 \"Christian the Mad\". By 1628, the town was changing overlords and occupation armies repeatedly as the war dragged on, ending up in Imperial hands by the time the war ended in 1648.\n\nOn 5 June 1695, [[Johann Conrad Schlaun]] was born in N\u00f6rde near Warburg (now one of Warburg's constituent communities).\n\n[[File:SbW 2639.jpg|thumb|[[Historical reenactment|Reenactment]] for the 250th anniversary of the ''Battle of Warburg'']]\nOn 31 July 1760, during the [[Seven Years' War]], Warburg was the scene of a battle that now bears its name. Twenty-four thousand [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]], [[Electorate of Hanover|Hanoverian]], Hessian and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] troops fought under Prince [[Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick|Ferdinand of Brunswick]] and the [[Crown Prince]] of [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]] (or Hesse-Cassel) against a [[France|French]] army of 21,500 soldiers led by Lieutenant-General Le Chevalier du Muy and the [[Victor-Fran\u00e7ois, 2nd duc de Broglie|Duke of Broglie]]. The Prussians and their allies won, killing 8,000 French soldiers while losing only 1,500 themselves, leaving them free to sack the town. A tower on the Desenberg recalls the [[Battle of Warburg]].\n\nOn 3 August 1802, Prussian troops came into Warburg in anticipation of the decisions of [[German Mediatisation]] (''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]''). From 1807 to 1813, in the [[Napoleon]]ic Era, Warburg belonged to the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]]. After the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815, Warburg was once again assigned to Prussia. The next year, it became a district seat.\n\nIn 1850, the [[Hamm\u2013Warburg railway|railway from Hamm]] was opened. In 1892 \u2013 244 years after it had ended \u2013 Warburg at last paid off the last of the debts that it had incurred because of the Thirty Years' War.\n\nIn 1933, at the March elections, the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] won 67.2% of the vote in Warburg to the [[NSDAP]]'s 21.8%.\n\nDuring [[World War II]] there was a [[Prisoner of war]] camp [[Oflag VI-B]] in the suburb D\u00f6ssel. 20 September 1943, 47 Polish officers escaped through a tunnel. 37 were recaptured and executed by the Gestapo.\n\nOn 1 April 1945, Warburg was captured by [[United States|American]] troops.\n\nOn 1 January 1975 came municipal reorganization, which saw 16 formerly independent municipalities merged into a new greater town of Warburg. Also, the districts of Warburg and H\u00f6xter were united, taking the latter's name. In 1983, Warburg became a founding member of the Wesphalian Hanseatic League (''Westf\u00e4lischer Hansebund'').\n\n=== History of the districts ===\n\n==== Welda ====\nThe lands around Warburg's constituent community of Welda, once a border town between [[Westphalia]], [[Waldeck, Hesse|Waldeck]] and [[Hesse]], have yielded forth archaeological evidence of a [[Celt]]ic presence. It has been confirmed that the village was once visited in 1856 by Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm, who went on to become the \"Ninety-Nine-Day Emperor\", Kaiser [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Friedrich III]]. He presented the church with a [[Eucharist|Communion]] [[Chalice (cup)|chalice]]. After the [[Second World War]], in 1945, there was an American [[internment|prison camp]] at Welda holding roughly 80,000 German [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]].\n\n==== Wormeln ====\nLikewise, Wormeln's surrounding area has yielded archaeological finds that point to ancient settlement.\n\nThere is believed to have been a parish in Wormeln by about 780, with church patrons [[Simon the Zealot]] and [[Judah (Biblical figure)|Judah]]. Wormeln had its first documentary mention in 1018 in a donation document from Count [[Dodiko]] to [[Meinwerk, Bishop of Paderborn]].\n\nAbout 1246, the Counts of Everstein founded the Wormeln [[Cistercian Convent]] of the \"Nuns of the Grey Order\" [[Cistercians]]. On 16 September 1810, [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte]], King of Westphalia in Napoleonic times, decreed the convent's dissolution.\n\n=== Population ===\n<small>(each time at 31 December)</small>\n*1998 \u2013 24,130\n*1999 \u2013 24,234\n*2000 \u2013 24,204\n*2001 \u2013 24,218\n*2002 \u2013 24,273\n*2003 \u2013 24,292\n*2004 \u2013 24,380\n\n== Religion ==\n\n=== Christianity ===\n[[File:Warburger Neustadtkirche.jpg|thumb|211x211px|catholic Church ''St. John-Baptiste'' in Warburg ''New-town'']]\nDuring the [[Saxon Wars]] in the 8th century the area round the Diemel was incorporated into the [[Frankish realm]]. Beside other places Warburg is presumed to be the location were the [[Irminsul]], an old Saxon sacred pillar. The Austrian abbot [[Saint Sturm|Sturm]]ius proselytized the area around the Diemel and [[Weser]] in 774. So the area around Warburg was Christianized from 774 on.\n[[File:Warburg, Germany - panoramio (12).jpg|thumb|cathoric Church ''St. Mary-Visitation'' in Warburg ''Old-Town'']]\n\n==== Catholic church ====\nAs most of Warburg's inhabitants are Catholic it is part of the center zone of the [[Catholic Archdiocese of Paderborn]]. Many theologians as Otto Beckmann, Anton Corvinus or Julius Dammann, office bearers of the church like Johann Conrad Schlaun or Arnold G\u00fcldenpfennig and church artists like Josef Kohlschein come from Warburg.\n\n==== Syriac Orthodox ====\n[[File:Syrisch-orthodoxes Kloster, ehemaliges Dominikanerkloster.JPG|thumb|The syriac orthodox monastery (former monastery of Dominican-fraternity) in Warburg]]\nThe [[Syriac Orthodox Church]]'s bishopric of Germany was founded in 1997 and has its Episcopal seat in the former [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] monastery in Warburg. After the monastery was renovated, it is now used as the Syriac Orthodox Monastery of Mor Yacqub of Sarugh, and as a centre for the community in Westphalia. The Body of Patriarch [[Ignatius Zakka I Iwas]] is buried here.<ref>http://sor.cua.edu/</ref>\n\n=== Jewish life in Warburg ===\n[[File:J\u00fcdischer Friedhof, Warburg.JPG|thumb|The Jewish cemetery in Warburg]]\nWarburg had in bygone days an important [[Jew]]ish community. Around the year  1800, roughly 200 of Warburg's 2,000 townsfolk were Jewish, and about 1900, some 300 of the 5,000 people in the town were. The sharp upswing in the population as a whole was due to migration from the countryside, industries setting up shop in town, and railway operations.\n\nIn the 16th century, the Warburg family - originally from [[Venice]] - took the town's name as their own and moved in the second half of the 18th century to [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]] ([[Hamburg]]), where the brothers Moses Marcus and Gerson Warburg built up the Bankinstitut M&M Warburg in 1798. From this family also came the natural scientists Otto and [[Emil Warburg]] the art historian and cultural theorist Abraham Moritz Warburg, better known as [[Aby Warburg]], who founded the Warburg Institute.\n\nAnother well known Warburg Jewish family were the Oppenheims, among whom was [[Hermann Oppenheim]], a famous German [[neurologist]]. Yet another famous townsman was Emil Herz, a publisher at the [[Ullstein-Verlag]] (until the [[Nazis]] forced him out as the company's director in 1934, after he had worked there for 30 years), who described in his book something of Jewish life in Warburg.\n\nThere is still a Jewish [[cemetery]] in Warburg today. The [[synagogue]], which stood in the Old Town, was destroyed on ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' (9 November 1938).\n\n== Culture ==\n\n=== Buildings ===\n[[File:Eckmaenneken-Haus, erbaut 1471, Warburg.JPG|thumb|The ''Eckm\u00e4nneken-Haus'' (Corner figure house), built in 1471]]\n[[File:Warburg, Hauptstra\u00dfe.JPG|thumb|Warburg, Main street (Hauptstra\u00dfe)]]\n*Historic Old and New towns\n*Town Hall \"between the towns\"\n*Town hall was once its castle\n*Partial city wall with remainders of the medieval city walls from both towns\n*Five defensive towers (Frankenturm, Chattenturm, Johannesturm, Biermannsturm and Sackturm)\n*Two town gates (Johannestor and Sacktor)\n*Half-timbered houses among the oldest in Nordrhein-Westfalen (for example:Hirsch-Apotheke, Corvinushaus, Eckm\u00e4nneken-Haus, Haus B\u00f6ttrich)\n*Catholic Oldtown church 'St. Maria-Heimsuchung' (1299)\n*Catholic Newtown church 'St. Johannes Baptist' (1264)\n*Ev.

The old town's citizens first erected the connection wall of the castle to the ''Johannistor-Tower''. Because of height of the castle mountain the ''Chattenturm'' was constructed. The round ''Sackturm'' (Saxon tower) next to the ''Sacktor'' (Saxon Gate) was erected in 1443 while the ''Sacktor'' was built around 1300. Until 1830, the town castle had about ten city towers and nine city gates. In the walls of the old town, there were five gates and four in the new town, of which only the ''Sacktor'' and the ''Johannistor'' have been preserved. Between 1801 and 1840, the other gates were taken down.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Frankenturm, erbaut 1350, Warburg.jpg|Frankenturm, built 1350, Warburg\nFile:Sackturm, erbaut 1443, und Sacktor, Warburg.jpg|Sackturm, built 1443, and Sacktor, Warburg\nFile:Sacktor, Warburg.jpg|Sacktor, built about 1300, Warburg\nFile:Sackturm, erbaut 1443, Warburg.jpg|Sackturm, built 1443, Warburg (view from castle graveyard)\nFile:Biermannsturm, erbaut Mitte 15.

The [[fleur-de-lis]] charge seen in today's arms originally appeared on [[coin]]s minted in the town, beginning in 1227. Smaller town seals in the 14th century also showed the lis, with the gateway only appearing on the greater seal.\n\nFor a time in the 20th century, Warburg used a coat of arms based on the old greater seal, showing the walls, towers and gateway, but not the bishop. His place was taken by a fleur-de-lis. The town, however, readopted the fleur-de-lis-only composition on 30 June 1977.<ref>[http://www.ngw.nl/int/dld/w/warburg.htm Heraldry of the World: Warburg]</ref>\n\n=== Town friendships ===\n* {{Flagicon|Germany}} [[Falkenberg/Elster]], Germany, since 1991\n* {{Flagicon|Germany}} [[Luckau]], Germany, since 1992\n* {{Flagicon|Austria}} [[Walchsee]], [[Austria]] (through the constituent community of Scherfede)\n\n=== Town partnerships ===\n* {{Flagicon|Poland}} [[Prochowice]], [[Poland]], since 1997\n* {{Flagicon|Belgium}} [[Ledegem]]-Sint-Eloois-Winkel, [[Belgium]], since 1998\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\nWarburg stands as a middle centre in an area shaped by [[agriculture]].

With the \"Prussian Fire Order\" in the early 19th century, even the outlying communities were obliged to lay the groundwork for [[firefighting]].\n\nBeginning about 1850 in what is today Warburg's municipal area, the first structures of modern [[fire brigade]]s were taking shape as \"dousing and spraying teams\". These were the beginnings of the Ossendorf and Scherfede fire brigades.\n\nAfter the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870\u20131871), it was [[veteran]]s who had the idea of setting up volunteer fire brigades after the French example of the ''pompiers''. Thus arose the Wormeln fire brigade.\n\nIn the main town of Warburg, the volunteer fire brigade was founded in 1889, and quickly thereafter, the same happened in communities throughout the ''Warburger Land''. After the fire in Hohenwepel in 1912, they were established in D\u00f6ssel, Hohenwepel and Menne.\n\nToday's Warburg volunteer fire brigade was founded in 1975 by merging the town's and all newly amalgamated centres' former volunteer fire brigades.\n\n==Famous people==\nThe following personalities were born in Warburg:\n*[[Antonius Corvinus]], [[theologian]]\n*[[Antonius Eisenhoit]], goldsmith\n*[[Johann Conrad Schlaun]], [[Baroque]] building master (born in N\u00f6rde near Warburg)\n*[[Arnold G\u00fcldenpfennig]], Paderborn cathedral and diocesan building master\n*[[Ignatz Urban]], [[botanist]]\n*[[Hermann Oppenheim]], [[Charit\u00e9]] neurologist\n*[[Emil Herz]], [[Germanist]] and Ullstein publishing director\n*[[Rudolf von Delius]], writer, publisher\n*[[Heinrich Emmerich]], [[cartography|cartographic]] leader in the [[Holy See|Vatican]] (born in D\u00f6ssel near Warburg)\n*[[Heinrich Holtgreve]], painter and artistic educator\n*[[Manfred Grothe]], suffragan bishop in the [[Bishopric of Paderborn]]\n\nThe following personalities were not born in Warburg, but lived and worked in the town:\n*[[Lorenz Humburg]] (1906\u20131994), painter, worked as an art teacher at Warburg [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasien]]\n*[[Christoph Cardinal Sch\u00f6nborn]] (born 1945), Archbishop of [[Vienna]], joined the Domican Order in Warburg in 1963\n*[[Josef Wirmer]] (1901\u20131944), jurist and [[Widerstand|Resistance]] fighter against [[National Socialism]]; a memorial stone is dedicated to him at the Gymnasium Marianum\n*[[Franz-Josef W\u00fcrmeling]], (1900\u20131986), family minister, Gymnasium Marianum old boy\n\n==See also==\n* [[Hardehausen Abbey]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons|Warburg|Warburg}}\n* [https://www.warburg.de/ Warburg]\n* [https://warburg-touristik.de/33-er-warburg/geschichte/67-mueseum-im-qsternq Museum im Stern \u2013 Information on town history, etc.]\n\n{{Lower Rhenish\u2013Westphalian Circle}}\n{{Towns and municipalities in H\u00f6xter district}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Towns in North Rhine-Westphalia]]\n[[Category:Members of the Hanseatic League]]\n[[Category:1802 disestablishments]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in the 10th century]]\n[[Category:H\u00f6xter (district)]]\n[[Category:1430s establishments in the Holy Roman Empire]]\n[[Category:1436 establishments in Europe]]\n[[Category:Holocaust locations in Germany]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the town in Germany||}}\n{{Infobox German location\n|type               = Stadt\n|image_coa            = Stadtwappen der Stadt Warburg.svg\n|coordinates       = {{coord|51|30|00|N|09|10|11|E|format=dms|display=inline,title}}\n|image_plan          = Warburg in HX.svg\n|state        = Nordrhein-Westfalen\n|district             = H\u00f6xter\n|elevation              = 230\n|area            = 168.71\n|population         = 23688\n|Stand             = 2009-06-30\n|postal_code               = 34414\n|area_code           = 0 56 41\n|licence               = HX\n|Kfz-alt           = WAR\n|Gemeindeschl\u00fcssel = 05 7 62 036\n|divisions        = 16 \n|Stra\u00dfe            = Bahnhofstra\u00dfe 28\n|website           = [https://www.warburg.de www.warburg.de]\n|mayor     = Michael Stickeln\n|party            = CDU\n}}\n[[File:Stadtpanorama-Warburg-2013.jpg|thumb|right|Warburg city panorama with sights]]\n'''Warburg''' is a town in eastern [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] on the river [[Diemel]] near the three-state point shared by [[Hessen]], [[Lower Saxony]] and North Rhine-Westphalia. It is in [[H\u00f6xter (district)|H\u00f6xter]] district and [[Detmold (region)|Detmold]] region. Warburg is the midpoint in the ''Warburger B\u00f6rde''.

In the 8th and 9th centuries came the [[Christianization]] of the [[Saxons]] in the Diemel area.\n\nThe name Warburg was first mentioned in a document sometime around 1010, although [[archaeology|archaeological]] finds have established that there were already people living in what is now Warburg by [[protohistory|protohistoric]] times. The first definite documentary mention came in 1036.\n[[File:Warburg Altstadt.jpg|thumb|293x293px|Old-Town Warburg with view to the Lutheran Church]]\nIn the 11th century there was on the ''Warburger Burgberg'' (\"Castle Mountain\") the \"Wartburg\", under whose protection people came and settled. The castle was at first owned by Count Dodiko, whose estate, according to documents, passed in 1020 to the [[Bishop of Paderborn]] when the Count's only son met his end in an accident. Eventually, sometime between 1021 and 1033, the Emperor further granted to the bishop the Count's rights. About 1180, the Old Town was granted town rights.\n\nFrom the castle hill, there was a good view over the Diemel Valley, such that a close watch could be kept on the [[ford (crossing)|ford]] that merchants had to cross going to Warburg and [[Paderborn]]. This ford on the Diemel was a crossroads of several ancient commercial roads and was crucial in the town's development into a central place. The Warburg New Town was founded in 1228\u201329 by [[Bernhard IV. zur Lippe]], Bishop of Paderborn, to bolster his political position in the Diemel area against encroachment by the [[Bishop of Cologne]]. About 1239, the New Town had been built into a complete town in its own right, and the townsfolk there had full civil rights after the [[Dortmund]] and [[Marsberg]] models. In 1260, the New Town was granted the right to build a town wall, not only against armies from afar, but even \u2013 expressly \u2013 against the Old Town.\n\nIn 1364, both the Old Town and the New Town became members of the [[Hanseatic League]]. By 1436, they had forgotten their differences, uniting that year into one town.\n\n==== Unification of the two towns ====\n[[File:Gipsabdruck Warburger Neustadt, Der Grote Breff von 1436.jpg|thumb|left|Plaster stamp of the seal of Warburg New Town under the constitutional document \"Der Grote Breff\" from 1436]]\nThe two towns, the Old Town and the New Town, joined in 1436 into one town. In ''Der Grote Breff'' (\"The Great Letter\"), the newly united town's constitution was precisely framed and sealed. Both former towns' seals are to be seen on the Great Letter. On the cast seal (in the picture), two defensive towers with a double wall are to be seen. Under the town gate stands the Bishop of Paderborn with a staff. The circumscription reads: ''\"Sigillium burgensium in wartborch\"''. The Great Letter is written in [[Middle Low German]], the Hanseatic League's language, and stands as a substantial legal document.\n[[File:Warburg-Blick-auf-Rathaus-Neustadtkirche.jpg|thumb|Town Hall ''Between the Towns'' in Warburg, built in 1568]]\nHitherto, the Old Town's and the New Town's council meetings had each been taking place in their respective town halls, each on their respective marketplaces. Now, however, there were two [[mayor]]s. This was solved by allowing each mayor to head the unified town for half the year. Furthermore, both town halls were used for council meetings, again, each for half the year. However, the problem of having two town halls was not fully resolved until 132 years after the two former towns had merged. Only then, in 1568, was the new ''Rathaus Zwischen den St\u00e4dten'' \u2013 Town Hall Between the Towns \u2013 built.\n\nThe common Town Hall, in the form of preserved [[Renaissance]] buildings, was built right on the former boundary between the two former towns, with two separate entrances for ''Altst\u00e4dter'' and ''Neust\u00e4dter'' (\"Old Towners\" and \"New Towners\"). In 1902\u201303, it was expanded with a [[Timber framing|half-timbered]] floor. It stands right where a gate, the ''Liebfrauentor'' (roughly, \"Gate of Our Lady\"), once stood. In the Middle Ages, this was the only gateway between the two then separate towns.\n\nThe Old Town's former Town Hall, renovated in 1973, nowadays serves [[gastronomy|gastronomical]] and residential ends. The New Town's former Town Hall served various purposes ranging from Town Hall cellar to assembly hall to market hall before it had to be torn down in 1803 owing to decrepitude.\n\nThere arose yet another superfluous government building in 1975 after the communities of the old ''[[Amt (subnational entity)|Amt]]'' of Warburg-Land were amalgamated with Warburg, namely the ''Amt'' administration building on Kasseler Stra\u00dfe, which was forsaken by the district authorities in favour of the ''Beh\u00f6rdenhaus'' (\"Authority House\") on Bahnhofstra\u00dfe.\n\n=== Modern times ===\n[[File:Merian, Matth\u00e4us - Topographia Westphaliae - Warburgum, 1647.jpg|thumb|[[Matth\u00e4us Merian]]: ''Warburgum''. Engraving from the ''Topographia Westphaliae'' from 1647]]\nIn the early 17th century, Warburg was a well known and rich trading town. Outside the town walls rose \"die H\u00fcffert\" as a new part of the town. In the [[Thirty Years' War]], great parts of die H\u00fcffert and other villages in the area were sacked and destroyed, impoverishing the town. In 1622, the town was captured by [[Christian the Younger of Brunswick, Bishop of Halberstadt]], who is sometimes called in [[German language|German]] ''der tolle Christian'' \u2013 \"Christian the Mad\". By 1628, the town was changing overlords and occupation armies repeatedly as the war dragged on, ending up in Imperial hands by the time the war ended in 1648.\n\nOn 5 June 1695, [[Johann Conrad Schlaun]] was born in N\u00f6rde near Warburg (now one of Warburg's constituent communities).\n\n[[File:SbW 2639.jpg|thumb|[[Historical reenactment|Reenactment]] for the 250th anniversary of the ''Battle of Warburg'']]\nOn 31 July 1760, during the [[Seven Years' War]], Warburg was the scene of a battle that now bears its name. Twenty-four thousand [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]], [[Electorate of Hanover|Hanoverian]], Hessian and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] troops fought under Prince [[Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick|Ferdinand of Brunswick]] and the [[Crown Prince]] of [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]] (or Hesse-Cassel) against a [[France|French]] army of 21,500 soldiers led by Lieutenant-General Le Chevalier du Muy and the [[Victor-Fran\u00e7ois, 2nd duc de Broglie|Duke of Broglie]]. The Prussians and their allies won, killing 8,000 French soldiers while losing only 1,500 themselves, leaving them free to sack the town. A tower on the Desenberg recalls the [[Battle of Warburg]].\n\nOn 3 August 1802, Prussian troops came into Warburg in anticipation of the decisions of [[German Mediatisation]] (''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]''). From 1807 to 1813, in the [[Napoleon]]ic Era, Warburg belonged to the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]]. After the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815, Warburg was once again assigned to Prussia. The next year, it became a district seat.\n\nIn 1850, the [[Hamm\u2013Warburg railway|railway from Hamm]] was opened. In 1892 \u2013 244 years after it had ended \u2013 Warburg at last paid off the last of the debts that it had incurred because of the Thirty Years' War.\n\nIn 1933, at the March elections, the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] won 67.2% of the vote in Warburg to the [[NSDAP]]'s 21.8%.\n\nDuring [[World War II]] there was a [[Prisoner of war]] camp [[Oflag VI-B]] in the suburb D\u00f6ssel. 20 September 1943, 47 Polish officers escaped through a tunnel. 37 were recaptured and executed by the Gestapo.\n\nOn 1 April 1945, Warburg was captured by [[United States|American]] troops.\n\nOn 1 January 1975 came municipal reorganization, which saw 16 formerly independent municipalities merged into a new greater town of Warburg. Also, the districts of Warburg and H\u00f6xter were united, taking the latter's name. In 1983, Warburg became a founding member of the Wesphalian Hanseatic League (''Westf\u00e4lischer Hansebund'').\n\n=== History of the districts ===\n\n==== Welda ====\nThe lands around Warburg's constituent community of Welda, once a border town between [[Westphalia]], [[Waldeck, Hesse|Waldeck]] and [[Hesse]], have yielded forth archaeological evidence of a [[Celt]]ic presence. It has been confirmed that the village was once visited in 1856 by Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm, who went on to become the \"Ninety-Nine-Day Emperor\", Kaiser [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Friedrich III]]. He presented the church with a [[Eucharist|Communion]] [[Chalice (cup)|chalice]]. After the [[Second World War]], in 1945, there was an American [[internment|prison camp]] at Welda holding roughly 80,000 German [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]].\n\n==== Wormeln ====\nLikewise, Wormeln's surrounding area has yielded archaeological finds that point to ancient settlement.\n\nThere is believed to have been a parish in Wormeln by about 780, with church patrons [[Simon the Zealot]] and [[Judah (Biblical figure)|Judah]]. Wormeln had its first documentary mention in 1018 in a donation document from Count [[Dodiko]] to [[Meinwerk, Bishop of Paderborn]].\n\nAbout 1246, the Counts of Everstein founded the Wormeln [[Cistercian Convent]] of the \"Nuns of the Grey Order\" [[Cistercians]]. On 16 September 1810, [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte]], King of Westphalia in Napoleonic times, decreed the convent's dissolution.\n\n=== Population ===\n<small>(each time at 31 December)</small>\n*1998 \u2013 24,130\n*1999 \u2013 24,234\n*2000 \u2013 24,204\n*2001 \u2013 24,218\n*2002 \u2013 24,273\n*2003 \u2013 24,292\n*2004 \u2013 24,380\n\n== Religion ==\n\n=== Christianity ===\n[[File:Warburger Neustadtkirche.jpg|thumb|211x211px|catholic Church ''St. John-Baptiste'' in Warburg ''New-town'']]\nDuring the [[Saxon Wars]] in the 8th century the area round the Diemel was incorporated into the [[Frankish realm]]. Beside other places Warburg is presumed to be the location were the [[Irminsul]], an old Saxon sacred pillar. The Austrian abbot [[Saint Sturm|Sturm]]ius proselytized the area around the Diemel and [[Weser]] in 774. So the area around Warburg was Christianized from 774 on.\n[[File:Warburg, Germany - panoramio (12).jpg|thumb|cathoric Church ''St. Mary-Visitation'' in Warburg ''Old-Town'']]\n\n==== Catholic church ====\nAs most of Warburg's inhabitants are Catholic it is part of the center zone of the [[Catholic Archdiocese of Paderborn]]. Many theologians as Otto Beckmann, Anton Corvinus or Julius Dammann, office bearers of the church like Johann Conrad Schlaun or Arnold G\u00fcldenpfennig and church artists like Josef Kohlschein come from Warburg.\n\n==== Syriac Orthodox ====\n[[File:Syrisch-orthodoxes Kloster, ehemaliges Dominikanerkloster.JPG|thumb|The syriac orthodox monastery (former monastery of Dominican-fraternity) in Warburg]]\nThe [[Syriac Orthodox Church]]'s bishopric of Germany was founded in 1997 and has its Episcopal seat in the former [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] monastery in Warburg. After the monastery was renovated, it is now used as the Syriac Orthodox Monastery of Mor Yacqub of Sarugh, and as a centre for the community in Westphalia. The Body of Patriarch [[Ignatius Zakka I Iwas]] is buried here.<ref>http://sor.cua.edu/</ref>\n\n=== Jewish life in Warburg ===\n[[File:J\u00fcdischer Friedhof, Warburg.JPG|thumb|The Jewish cemetery in Warburg]]\nWarburg had in bygone days an important [[Jew]]ish community. Around the year  1800, roughly 200 of Warburg's 2,000 townsfolk were Jewish, and about 1900, some 300 of the 5,000 people in the town were. The sharp upswing in the population as a whole was due to migration from the countryside, industries setting up shop in town, and railway operations.\n\nIn the 16th century, the Warburg family - originally from [[Venice]] - took the town's name as their own and moved in the second half of the 18th century to [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]] ([[Hamburg]]), where the brothers Moses Marcus and Gerson Warburg built up the Bankinstitut M&M Warburg in 1798. From this family also came the natural scientists Otto and [[Emil Warburg]] the art historian and cultural theorist Abraham Moritz Warburg, better known as [[Aby Warburg]], who founded the Warburg Institute.\n\nAnother well known Warburg Jewish family were the Oppenheims, among whom was [[Hermann Oppenheim]], a famous German [[neurologist]]. Yet another famous townsman was Emil Herz, a publisher at the [[Ullstein-Verlag]] (until the [[Nazis]] forced him out as the company's director in 1934, after he had worked there for 30 years), who described in his book something of Jewish life in Warburg.\n\nThere is still a Jewish [[cemetery]] in Warburg today. The [[synagogue]], which stood in the Old Town, was destroyed on ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' (9 November 1938).\n\n== Culture ==\n\n=== Buildings ===\n[[File:Eckmaenneken-Haus, erbaut 1471, Warburg.JPG|thumb|The ''Eckm\u00e4nneken-Haus'' (Corner figure house), built in 1471]]\n[[File:Warburg, Hauptstra\u00dfe.JPG|thumb|Warburg, Main street (Hauptstra\u00dfe)]]\n*Historic Old and New towns\n*Town Hall \"between the towns\"\n*Town hall was once its castle\n*Partial city wall with remainders of the medieval city walls from both towns\n*Five defensive towers (Frankenturm, Chattenturm, Johannesturm, Biermannsturm and Sackturm)\n*Two town gates (Johannestor and Sacktor)\n*Half-timbered houses among the oldest in Nordrhein-Westfalen (for example:Hirsch-Apotheke, Corvinushaus, Eckm\u00e4nneken-Haus, Haus B\u00f6ttrich)\n*Catholic Oldtown church 'St. Maria-Heimsuchung' (1299)\n*Catholic Newtown church 'St. Johannes Baptist' (1264)\n*Ev.

The old town's citizens first erected the connection wall of the castle to the ''Johannistor-Tower''. Because of height of the castle mountain the ''Chattenturm'' was constructed. The round ''Sackturm'' (Saxon tower) next to the ''Sacktor'' (Saxon Gate) was erected in 1443 while the ''Sacktor'' was built around 1300. Until 1830, the town castle had about ten city towers and nine city gates. In the walls of the old town, there were five gates and four in the new town, of which only the ''Sacktor'' and the ''Johannistor'' have been preserved. Between 1801 and 1840, the other gates were taken down.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Frankenturm, erbaut 1350, Warburg.jpg|Frankenturm, built 1350, Warburg\nFile:Sackturm, erbaut 1443, und Sacktor, Warburg.jpg|Sackturm, built 1443, and Sacktor, Warburg\nFile:Sacktor, Warburg.jpg|Sacktor, built about 1300, Warburg\nFile:Sackturm, erbaut 1443, Warburg.jpg|Sackturm, built 1443, Warburg (view from castle graveyard)\nFile:Biermannsturm, erbaut Mitte 15.

The [[fleur-de-lis]] charge seen in today's arms originally appeared on [[coin]]s minted in the town, beginning in 1227. Smaller town seals in the 14th century also showed the lis, with the gateway only appearing on the greater seal.\n\nFor a time in the 20th century, Warburg used a coat of arms based on the old greater seal, showing the walls, towers and gateway, but not the bishop. His place was taken by a fleur-de-lis. The town, however, readopted the fleur-de-lis-only composition on 30 June 1977.<ref>[http://www.ngw.nl/int/dld/w/warburg.htm Heraldry of the World: Warburg]</ref>\n\n=== Town friendships ===\n* {{Flagicon|Germany}} [[Falkenberg/Elster]], Germany, since 1991\n* {{Flagicon|Germany}} [[Luckau]], Germany, since 1992\n* {{Flagicon|Austria}} [[Walchsee]], [[Austria]] (through the constituent community of Scherfede)\n\n=== Town partnerships ===\n* {{Flagicon|Poland}} [[Prochowice]], [[Poland]], since 1997\n* {{Flagicon|Belgium}} [[Ledegem]]-Sint-Eloois-Winkel, [[Belgium]], since 1998\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\nWarburg stands as a middle centre in an area shaped by [[agriculture]].

With the \"Prussian Fire Order\" in the early 19th century, even the outlying communities were obliged to lay the groundwork for [[firefighting]].\n\nBeginning about 1850 in what is today Warburg's municipal area, the first structures of modern [[fire brigade]]s were taking shape as \"dousing and spraying teams\". These were the beginnings of the Ossendorf and Scherfede fire brigades.\n\nAfter the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870\u20131871), it was [[veteran]]s who had the idea of setting up volunteer fire brigades after the French example of the ''pompiers''. Thus arose the Wormeln fire brigade.\n\nIn the main town of Warburg, the volunteer fire brigade was founded in 1889, and quickly thereafter, the same happened in communities throughout the ''Warburger Land''.

''An Historical Geography of the Ottoman Empire'', Leiden: Brill, 1968, p. 70</ref> The Republic reached its peak in the 15th and 16th centuries, when its [[thalassocracy]] rivalled that of the [[Republic of Venice]] and other Italian maritime republics.\n\nFor centuries, Dubrovnik was an ally of [[Ancona]], the other Adriatic [[maritime republic]] rival of Venice, which was itself the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s chief rival for control of the Adriatic. This alliance enabled the two towns set on opposite sides of the Adriatic to resist attempts by the Venetians to make the Adriatic a \"Venetian Bay\", also controlling directly or indirectly all the Adriatic ports. Ancona and Dubrovnik developed an alternative trade route to the Venetian (Venice-[[Austria]]-[[Germany]]): starting in Dubrovnik it went on to Ancona, through [[Florence]] and ended in [[Flanders]] [//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/Repubbliche_marinare_-_fondachi_anconitani.png as seen on this map].\n\nThe Republic of Ragusa received its own Statutes as early as 1272,  which, among other things, codified Roman practice and local customs. The Statutes included prescriptions for [[Urban planning|town planning]] and the regulation of quarantine (for sanitary reasons).<ref>{{cite book|publisher=Naprijed, Naklada|location=Zagreb|title=The Croatian Adriatic Tourist Guide|page=354|date=July 1999|editor-last=Radovinovic|editor-first=Radovan|isbn=953-178-097-8}}</ref>\n\nThe Republic was an early adopter of what are now regarded as modern laws and institutions: a medical service was introduced in 1301, with the first [[pharmacy]], still operating to this day, being opened in 1317. An [[almshouse]] was opened in 1347, and the first quarantine hospital (Lazarete) was established in 1377. [[Slave trading]] was abolished in 1418, and an [[orphanage]] opened in 1432. A {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} [[water supply network|water supply system]], instead of a cistern, was constructed in 1438 by the Neapolitan architect and engineer Onofrio della Cava. He completed the aqueduct with two public fountains. He also built a number of mills along one of its branches.\n\nThe city was ruled by the local [[aristocracy]] which was of Latin-Dalmatian extraction and formed two [[city council]]s. As usual for the time, they maintained a strict system of [[social class]]es. The republic abolished the [[History of slavery|slave trade]] early in the 15th century and valued liberty highly. The city successfully balanced its sovereignty between the interests of Venice and the [[Ottoman Empire]] for centuries.\n\nThe languages spoken by the people were the Romance Dalmatian and common Croatian. The latter started to replace Dalmatian little by little from the 11th century among the common inhabitants of the city. [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Venetian Language|Venetian]] would become important languages of culture and trade in Dubrovnik. At the same time, Dubrovnik became a cradle of [[Croatian literature]].\n\n[[File:Onofrio's Fountain, Dubrovnik, Croatia.JPG|thumb|right|Big Onofrio's fountain (1438)]]\nThe economic wealth of the Republic was partially the result of the land it developed, but especially of seafaring trade. With the help of skilled diplomacy, Dubrovnik merchants travelled lands freely and the city had a huge fleet of [[Cargo ship|merchant ships]] ([[wiktionary:argosy|argosy]]) that travelled all over the world. From these travels they founded some settlements, from India to America, and brought parts of their culture and flora home with them. One of its keys to success was not conquering, but trading and sailing under a white flag with the {{lang-la|Libertas}} word  (freedom) prominently featured on it. The flag was adopted when slave trading was abolished in 1418.\n\nMany [[Marrano|Conversos]], Jews from Spain and [[Portugal]], were attracted to the city. In May 1544, a ship landed there filled exclusively with Portuguese refugees, as Balthasar de Faria reported to King John. During this time there worked in the city one of the most famous cannon and bell founders of his time: [[Ivan Rabljanin]] (Magister Johannes Baptista Arbensis de la Tolle). Already in 1571 Dubrovnik sold its protectorate over some Christian settlements in other parts of the Ottoman Empire to France and [[Venice]]. At that time there was also a colony of Dubrovnik in [[Fes]] in Morocco. The bishop of Dubrovnik was a [[Cardinal protector]] in 1571. At that time there were only 16 other countries which had Cardinal protectors; those being France, Spain, Austria, Portugal, Poland, England, Scotland, Ireland, Naples, Sicily, Sardinia, Savoy, Lucca, Greece, Illyria, Armenia and Lebanon.\n[[File:Ragusa.png|thumb|left|Territory of the Republic before 1808]]\n\nThe Republic gradually declined due to a combination of a [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] shipping crisis and the catastrophic [[1667 Dubrovnik earthquake|earthquake of 1667]]<ref>Husebye, Eystein Sverre.

In 1699, the Republic was forced to sell [[Neum|two mainland patches of its territory]] to the Ottomans in order to avoid being caught in the clash with advancing Venetian forces. Today this strip of land belongs to [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and is that country's only direct access to the Adriatic. A highlight of Dubrovnik's diplomacy was the involvement in the [[Diplomacy in the American Revolutionary War#Ragusa|American Revolution]].<ref>''Dubrovnik and the American Revolution: Francesco Favi's Letters,'' Francesco Favi, ed. by [[Wayne S. Vucinich]], Ragusan Press, 1977.</ref>\n\nOn 27 May 1806, the forces of the [[First French Empire|Empire of France]] occupied the neutral [[Republic of Ragusa]]. Upon entering Ragusan territory without permission and approaching the capital, the French General [[Jacques Lauriston]] demanded that his troops be allowed to rest and be provided with food and drink in the city before continuing on to take possession of their holdings in the [[Bay of Kotor]]. However, this was a deception because as soon as they entered the city, they proceeded to occupy it in the name of Napoleon.{{sfn|Vojnovi\u0107|2009|p=187-189}} Almost immediately after the beginning of the French occupation, Russian and Montenegrin troops entered Ragusan territory and began fighting the French army, raiding and pillaging everything along the way and culminating in a siege of the occupied city (during which 3,000 cannonballs fell on the city).{{sfn|Vojnovi\u0107|2009|p=240-241,247}} In 1808 [[Auguste Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Louis Viesse de Marmont|Marshal Marmont]] issued a proclamation abolishing the [[Republic of Ragusa]] and amalgamating its territory into the French Empire's client state, the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy]]. Marmont claimed the newly created title of \"Duke of Ragusa\" (''Duc de Raguse'') and in 1810 Ragusa, together with [[Istria]] and [[Dalmatia]], went to the newly created French [[Illyrian Provinces]].\n\nAfter seven years of French occupation, encouraged by the desertion of French soldiers after the failed [[French Invasion of Russia|invasion of Russia]] and the reentry of Austria in the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|war]], all the social classes of the Ragusan people rose up in a general insurrection, led by the patricians, against the Napoleonic invaders.{{sfn|Vojnovi\u0107|2009|p=147}} On 18 June 1813, together with British forces they forced the surrender of the French garrison of the island of [[\u0160ipan]], soon also the heavily fortified town of [[Ston]] and the island of [[Lopud]], after which the insurrection spread throughout the mainland, starting with [[Konavle]].{{sfn|Vojnovi\u0107|2009|p=150-154}} They then [[Siege of Ragusa|laid siege]] to the occupied city, helped by the British [[Royal Navy]], who had enjoyed [[Adriatic campaign of 1807\u20131814|unopposed domination over the Adriatic sea]], under the command of Captain [[William Hoste]], with his ships HMS ''Bacchante'' and {{HMS|Saracen|1812|6}}. Soon the population inside the city joined the insurrection.{{sfn|Vojnovi\u0107|2009|p=191}} The [[Austrian Empire]] sent a force under General Todor Milutinovi\u0107 offering to help their Ragusan allies.{{sfn|Vojnovi\u0107|2009|p=172-173}} However, as was soon shown, their intention was to in fact replace the French occupation of Ragusa with their own. Seducing one of the temporary governors of the Republic, [[Biagio Bernardo Caboga]], with promises of power and influence (which were later cut short and who died in ignominy, branded as a traitor by his people), they managed to convince him to keep the gate to the east closed to the Ragusan forces and to let Austrian forces enter the City from the west, once the French garrison of 500 troops under General [[Joseph H\u00e9lie D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Perruquet de Montrichard|Joseph de Montrichard]] had surrendered.{{sfn|Vojnovi\u0107|2009|p=194}}\n\nAfter this, the Flag of Saint Blaise was flown alongside the Austrian and British colors, but only for two days because, on 30 January, General Milutinovi\u0107 ordered Mayor Sabo Giorgi to lower it. Overwhelmed by a feeling of deep patriotic pride, Giorgi, the last Rector of the Republic, refused to do so \"for the masses had hoisted it\". Subsequent events proved that Austria took every possible opportunity to invade the entire coast of the eastern Adriatic, from Venice to [[Kotor]]. The Austrians did everything in their power to eliminate the Ragusa issue at the [[Congress of Vienna]]. Ragusan representative [[Miho Bona]], elected at the last meeting of the Major Council, was denied participation in the Congress, while Milutinovi\u0107, prior to the final agreement of the allies, assumed complete control of the city.<ref name=\"Cosic2000\">{{cite journal |title=Dubrovnik Under French Rule (1810\u20131814) |first=Stjepan |last=\u0106osi\u0107 |url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/12648 |format=PDF |journal=[[Dubrovnik Annals]] |year=2000 |issue=4 |pages=103\u2013142 |accessdate=11 September 2009}}</ref>{{rp|141\u2013142}}\n\nRegardless of the fact that the government of the Ragusan Republic never signed any capitulation nor relinquished its sovereignty, which according to the rules of [[Klemens von Metternich]] that Austria adopted for the Vienna Congress should have meant that the Republic would be restored, the Austrian Empire managed to convince the other allies to allow it to keep the territory of the Republic.{{sfn|Vojnovi\u0107|2009|p=208-210}} While many smaller and less significant cities and former countries were permitted an audience, that right was refused to the representative of the Ragusan Republic.{{sfn|Vojnovi\u0107|2009|p=270-272}} All of this was in blatant contradiction to the solemn treaties that the Austrian Emperors signed with the Republic: the first on 20 August 1684, in which [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] promises and guarantees inviolate liberty (\"inviolatam libertatem\") to the Republic, and the second in 1772, in which the Empress [[Maria Theresa]] promises protection and respect of the inviolability of the freedom and territory of the Republic.{{sfn|Vojnovi\u0107|2009|p=217-218}}.\n\n===Languages===\nThe [[official language]] until 1472 was [[Latin]].

To oppose the demographics change due to increased Slavic immigration from the Balkans, the native Romance population of Ragusa, which made up the oligarchic government of the Republic, tried to prohibit the use of any Slavic languages in official councils.<ref>{{cite book|author=J.

They introduced a series of modifications intended to slowly centralise the bureaucratic, tax, religious, educational, and trade structure. These steps largely failed, despite the intention of wanting to stimulate the economy. Once the personal, political and economic damage of [[Napoleonic Wars|the Napoleonic Wars]] had been overcome, new movements began to form in the region, calling for a political reorganisation of the Adriatic along national lines. {{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}\n\nThe combination of these two forces\u2014a flawed Habsburg administrative system and new national movement claiming ethnicity as the founding block toward a community\u2014posed a particularly perplexing problem: Dalmatia was a province ruled by the [[German language|German-speaking]] [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg monarchy]], with bilingual (Serbo-Croatian- and Italian-speaking) elites that dominated the general population consisting of a Slavic Catholic majority, as well as a [[Orthodox Church|Slavic Orthodox]] minority.

Close to the Pile Gate stands the Big Onofrio's Fountain in the middle of a small square. It may have been inspired by the former Romanesque baptistry of the former cathedral in Buni\u0107 Square. The sculptural elements were lost in the earthquake of 1667. Water jets gush out of the mouth of the sixteen [[Mascaron (architecture)|mascaron]]s. The Little Onofrio's Fountain stands at the eastern side of the Placa, supplying water the market place in the Lu\u017ea Square.

It was rebuilt in 1929 as it had lost its stability through an earthquake and was in danger of falling. The brass face of the clock shows the phases of the moon. Two human figures strike the bell every hour. The tower stands next to the House of the Main Guard, also built in Gothic style. It was the residence of the admiral, commander-in-chief of the army. The Baroque portal was built between 1706 and 1708 by the Venetian architect [[Marino Gropelli]] (who also built St Blaise's church).\n\nIn 1418, the Republic of Ragusa, as Dubrovnik was then named, erected a statue of Roland (Ital. Orlando) as a symbol of loyalty to [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Luxembourg]] (1368\u20131437), King of Hungary and Croatia (as of 1387), Prince-Elector of Brandenburg (between 1378 and 1388 and again between 1411 and 1415), German King (as of 1411), King of Bohemia (as of 1419) and Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (as of 1433), who helped by a successful war alliance against Venice to retain Ragusa's independence. It stands in the middle of Lu\u017ea Square. Roland statues were typical symbols of city autonomy or independence, often erected under Sigismund in his Electorate of Brandenburg. In 1419 the sculptor [[Bonino of Milano]], with the help of local craftsmen, replaced the first Roland with the present Gothic statue. Its forearm was for a long time the unit of measure in Dubrovnik: one [[ell]] of Dubrovnik is equal to {{convert|51.2|cm|1|abbr=on}}.\n\n==== Monuments gallery ====\n{{Gallery cleanup}}\n<gallery>\nFile:Dubrovnik D81 3977 (38603495616).jpg|Big Onofrio's fountain\nFile:Dubrovnik D81 4017 (37941866864).jpg|Stradun, the main street of Dubrovnik\nFile:Dubrovnik D81 4021 (38659772061).jpg|Old city of Dubrovnik\nFile:Saint Blaise's Church, Dubrovnik - September 2017.jpg|Saint Blaise's Church\nFile:Saint Ignatius Church, Dubrovnik - September 2017.jpg|Saint Ignatius Church\nFile:Main street-Dubrovnik-1.jpg|Stradun, the main street of Dubrovnik\nFile:2011 Dubrownik, Mury miejskie.jpg|City walls\nFile:2011 Dubrownik, Fasada ko\u015bcio\u0142a (02).jpg|Church's fa\u00e7ade\nFile:2011 Dubrownik, Brama Pile (02).jpg|Pile Gate\n</gallery>\n\n===Walls of Dubrovnik===\n{{Main|Walls of Dubrovnik}}\nA feature of Dubrovnik is its walls (1.3 million visitors in 2018), which run almost {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=off}} around the city.

It was recorded in various forms in the medieval period, ''Rausia, Lavusa, Labusa, Raugia, Rachusa''. Various attempts have been made to etymologize the name.

A connection to the name of [[Ragusa, Italy|Sicilian Ragusa]] has also been proposed. Putanec (1993) gives a review of etymological suggestion, and favours an explanation of the name as pre-Greek (\"[[Pelasgians#Language|Pelasgian]]\"), from a root cognate to Greek {{lang|grc|\u1fe5\u03b1\u03b3\u03ae}} \"fissure\", with a suffix ''-ussa'' also found in the Greek name of [[Bra\u010d]], ''Elaphousa''.<ref name=Putanec>{{cite journal|first=Valentin|last=Putanec|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/69329|title=Naziv Labusedum iz 11. st. za grad Dubrovnik|journal=Rasprave|publisher=[[Institute of Croatian Language and Linguistics]]|date=June 1993|volume=19|language=hr|pages=289\u2013301|format=PDF|accessdate=2 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe classical explanation of the name is due to [[Constantine VII]]'s ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' (10th century).

''An Historical Geography of the Ottoman Empire'', Leiden: Brill, 1968, p. 70</ref> The Republic reached its peak in the 15th and 16th centuries, when its [[thalassocracy]] rivalled that of the [[Republic of Venice]] and other Italian maritime republics.\n\nFor centuries, Dubrovnik was an ally of [[Ancona]], the other Adriatic [[maritime republic]] rival of Venice, which was itself the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s chief rival for control of the Adriatic. This alliance enabled the two towns set on opposite sides of the Adriatic to resist attempts by the Venetians to make the Adriatic a \"Venetian Bay\", also controlling directly or indirectly all the Adriatic ports. Ancona and Dubrovnik developed an alternative trade route to the Venetian (Venice-[[Austria]]-[[Germany]]): starting in Dubrovnik it went on to Ancona, through [[Florence]] and ended in [[Flanders]] [//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/Repubbliche_marinare_-_fondachi_anconitani.png as seen on this map].\n\nThe Republic of Ragusa received its own Statutes as early as 1272,  which, among other things, codified Roman practice and local customs. The Statutes included prescriptions for [[Urban planning|town planning]] and the regulation of quarantine (for sanitary reasons).<ref>{{cite book|publisher=Naprijed, Naklada|location=Zagreb|title=The Croatian Adriatic Tourist Guide|page=354|date=July 1999|editor-last=Radovinovic|editor-first=Radovan|isbn=953-178-097-8}}</ref>\n\nThe Republic was an early adopter of what are now regarded as modern laws and institutions: a medical service was introduced in 1301, with the first [[pharmacy]], still operating to this day, being opened in 1317. An [[almshouse]] was opened in 1347, and the first quarantine hospital (Lazarete) was established in 1377. [[Slave trading]] was abolished in 1418, and an [[orphanage]] opened in 1432. A {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} [[water supply network|water supply system]], instead of a cistern, was constructed in 1438 by the Neapolitan architect and engineer Onofrio della Cava. He completed the aqueduct with two public fountains. He also built a number of mills along one of its branches.\n\nThe city was ruled by the local [[aristocracy]] which was of Latin-Dalmatian extraction and formed two [[city council]]s. As usual for the time, they maintained a strict system of [[social class]]es. The republic abolished the [[History of slavery|slave trade]] early in the 15th century and valued liberty highly. The city successfully balanced its sovereignty between the interests of Venice and the [[Ottoman Empire]] for centuries.\n\nThe languages spoken by the people were the Romance Dalmatian and common Croatian. The latter started to replace Dalmatian little by little from the 11th century among the common inhabitants of the city. [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Venetian Language|Venetian]] would become important languages of culture and trade in Dubrovnik. At the same time, Dubrovnik became a cradle of [[Croatian literature]].\n\n[[File:Onofrio's Fountain, Dubrovnik, Croatia.JPG|thumb|right|Big Onofrio's fountain (1438)]]\nThe economic wealth of the Republic was partially the result of the land it developed, but especially of seafaring trade. With the help of skilled diplomacy, Dubrovnik merchants travelled lands freely and the city had a huge fleet of [[Cargo ship|merchant ships]] ([[wiktionary:argosy|argosy]]) that travelled all over the world. From these travels they founded some settlements, from India to America, and brought parts of their culture and flora home with them. One of its keys to success was not conquering, but trading and sailing under a white flag with the {{lang-la|Libertas}} word  (freedom) prominently featured on it. The flag was adopted when slave trading was abolished in 1418.\n\nMany [[Marrano|Conversos]], Jews from Spain and [[Portugal]], were attracted to the city. In May 1544, a ship landed there filled exclusively with Portuguese refugees, as Balthasar de Faria reported to King John. During this time there worked in the city one of the most famous cannon and bell founders of his time: [[Ivan Rabljanin]] (Magister Johannes Baptista Arbensis de la Tolle). Already in 1571 Dubrovnik sold its protectorate over some Christian settlements in other parts of the Ottoman Empire to France and [[Venice]]. At that time there was also a colony of Dubrovnik in [[Fes]] in Morocco. The bishop of Dubrovnik was a [[Cardinal protector]] in 1571. At that time there were only 16 other countries which had Cardinal protectors; those being France, Spain, Austria, Portugal, Poland, England, Scotland, Ireland, Naples, Sicily, Sardinia, Savoy, Lucca, Greece, Illyria, Armenia and Lebanon.\n[[File:Ragusa.png|thumb|left|Territory of the Republic before 1808]]\n\nThe Republic gradually declined due to a combination of a [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] shipping crisis and the catastrophic [[1667 Dubrovnik earthquake|earthquake of 1667]]<ref>Husebye, Eystein Sverre.

In 1699, the Republic was forced to sell [[Neum|two mainland patches of its territory]] to the Ottomans in order to avoid being caught in the clash with advancing Venetian forces. Today this strip of land belongs to [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and is that country's only direct access to the Adriatic. A highlight of Dubrovnik's diplomacy was the involvement in the [[Diplomacy in the American Revolutionary War#Ragusa|American Revolution]].<ref>''Dubrovnik and the American Revolution: Francesco Favi's Letters,'' Francesco Favi, ed. by [[Wayne S. Vucinich]], Ragusan Press, 1977.</ref>\n\nOn 27 May 1806, the forces of the [[First French Empire|Empire of France]] occupied the neutral [[Republic of Ragusa]]. Upon entering Ragusan territory without permission and approaching the capital, the French General [[Jacques Lauriston]] demanded that his troops be allowed to rest and be provided with food and drink in the city before continuing on to take possession of their holdings in the [[Bay of Kotor]]. However, this was a deception because as soon as they entered the city, they proceeded to occupy it in the name of Napoleon.{{sfn|Vojnovi\u0107|2009|p=187-189}} Almost immediately after the beginning of the French occupation, Russian and Montenegrin troops entered Ragusan territory and began fighting the French army, raiding and pillaging everything along the way and culminating in a siege of the occupied city (during which 3,000 cannonballs fell on the city).{{sfn|Vojnovi\u0107|2009|p=240-241,247}} In 1808 [[Auguste Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Louis Viesse de Marmont|Marshal Marmont]] issued a proclamation abolishing the [[Republic of Ragusa]] and amalgamating its territory into the French Empire's client state, the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy]]. Marmont claimed the newly created title of \"Duke of Ragusa\" (''Duc de Raguse'') and in 1810 Ragusa, together with [[Istria]] and [[Dalmatia]], went to the newly created French [[Illyrian Provinces]].\n\nAfter seven years of French occupation, encouraged by the desertion of French soldiers after the failed [[French Invasion of Russia|invasion of Russia]] and the reentry of Austria in the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|war]], all the social classes of the Ragusan people rose up in a general insurrection, led by the patricians, against the Napoleonic invaders.{{sfn|Vojnovi\u0107|2009|p=147}} On 18 June 1813, together with British forces they forced the surrender of the French garrison of the island of [[\u0160ipan]], soon also the heavily fortified town of [[Ston]] and the island of [[Lopud]], after which the insurrection spread throughout the mainland, starting with [[Konavle]].{{sfn|Vojnovi\u0107|2009|p=150-154}} They then [[Siege of Ragusa|laid siege]] to the occupied city, helped by the British [[Royal Navy]], who had enjoyed [[Adriatic campaign of 1807\u20131814|unopposed domination over the Adriatic sea]], under the command of Captain [[William Hoste]], with his ships HMS ''Bacchante'' and {{HMS|Saracen|1812|6}}. Soon the population inside the city joined the insurrection.{{sfn|Vojnovi\u0107|2009|p=191}} The [[Austrian Empire]] sent a force under General Todor Milutinovi\u0107 offering to help their Ragusan allies.{{sfn|Vojnovi\u0107|2009|p=172-173}} However, as was soon shown, their intention was to in fact replace the French occupation of Ragusa with their own. Seducing one of the temporary governors of the Republic, [[Biagio Bernardo Caboga]], with promises of power and influence (which were later cut short and who died in ignominy, branded as a traitor by his people), they managed to convince him to keep the gate to the east closed to the Ragusan forces and to let Austrian forces enter the City from the west, once the French garrison of 500 troops under General [[Joseph H\u00e9lie D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Perruquet de Montrichard|Joseph de Montrichard]] had surrendered.{{sfn|Vojnovi\u0107|2009|p=194}}\n\nAfter this, the Flag of Saint Blaise was flown alongside the Austrian and British colors, but only for two days because, on 30 January, General Milutinovi\u0107 ordered Mayor Sabo Giorgi to lower it. Overwhelmed by a feeling of deep patriotic pride, Giorgi, the last Rector of the Republic, refused to do so \"for the masses had hoisted it\". Subsequent events proved that Austria took every possible opportunity to invade the entire coast of the eastern Adriatic, from Venice to [[Kotor]]. The Austrians did everything in their power to eliminate the Ragusa issue at the [[Congress of Vienna]]. Ragusan representative [[Miho Bona]], elected at the last meeting of the Major Council, was denied participation in the Congress, while Milutinovi\u0107, prior to the final agreement of the allies, assumed complete control of the city.<ref name=\"Cosic2000\">{{cite journal |title=Dubrovnik Under French Rule (1810\u20131814) |first=Stjepan |last=\u0106osi\u0107 |url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/12648 |format=PDF |journal=[[Dubrovnik Annals]] |year=2000 |issue=4 |pages=103\u2013142 |accessdate=11 September 2009}}</ref>{{rp|141\u2013142}}\n\nRegardless of the fact that the government of the Ragusan Republic never signed any capitulation nor relinquished its sovereignty, which according to the rules of [[Klemens von Metternich]] that Austria adopted for the Vienna Congress should have meant that the Republic would be restored, the Austrian Empire managed to convince the other allies to allow it to keep the territory of the Republic.{{sfn|Vojnovi\u0107|2009|p=208-210}} While many smaller and less significant cities and former countries were permitted an audience, that right was refused to the representative of the Ragusan Republic.{{sfn|Vojnovi\u0107|2009|p=270-272}} All of this was in blatant contradiction to the solemn treaties that the Austrian Emperors signed with the Republic: the first on 20 August 1684, in which [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] promises and guarantees inviolate liberty (\"inviolatam libertatem\") to the Republic, and the second in 1772, in which the Empress [[Maria Theresa]] promises protection and respect of the inviolability of the freedom and territory of the Republic.{{sfn|Vojnovi\u0107|2009|p=217-218}}.\n\n===Languages===\nThe [[official language]] until 1472 was [[Latin]].

To oppose the demographics change due to increased Slavic immigration from the Balkans, the native Romance population of Ragusa, which made up the oligarchic government of the Republic, tried to prohibit the use of any Slavic languages in official councils.<ref>{{cite book|author=J.

They introduced a series of modifications intended to slowly centralise the bureaucratic, tax, religious, educational, and trade structure. These steps largely failed, despite the intention of wanting to stimulate the economy. Once the personal, political and economic damage of [[Napoleonic Wars|the Napoleonic Wars]] had been overcome, new movements began to form in the region, calling for a political reorganisation of the Adriatic along national lines. {{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}\n\nThe combination of these two forces\u2014a flawed Habsburg administrative system and new national movement claiming ethnicity as the founding block toward a community\u2014posed a particularly perplexing problem: Dalmatia was a province ruled by the [[German language|German-speaking]] [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg monarchy]], with bilingual (Serbo-Croatian- and Italian-speaking) elites that dominated the general population consisting of a Slavic Catholic majority, as well as a [[Orthodox Church|Slavic Orthodox]] minority.

Close to the Pile Gate stands the Big Onofrio's Fountain in the middle of a small square. It may have been inspired by the former Romanesque baptistry of the former cathedral in Buni\u0107 Square. The sculptural elements were lost in the earthquake of 1667. Water jets gush out of the mouth of the sixteen [[Mascaron (architecture)|mascaron]]s. The Little Onofrio's Fountain stands at the eastern side of the Placa, supplying water the market place in the Lu\u017ea Square. The sculptures ware made by the Milanese artist [[Pietro di Martino]] (who also sculpted the ornaments in the Rector's Palace and made a statue \u2013 now lost \u2013 for the Franciscan church).\n\nThe {{convert|31|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} [[Dubrovnik Bell Tower]], built in 1444, is one of the symbols of the free city state of Ragusa. It was built by the local architects Gruba\u010devi\u0107, Uti\u0161enovi\u0107 and Radon\u010di\u0107. It was rebuilt in 1929 as it had lost its stability through an earthquake and was in danger of falling. The brass face of the clock shows the phases of the moon. Two human figures strike the bell every hour. The tower stands next to the House of the Main Guard, also built in Gothic style. It was the residence of the admiral, commander-in-chief of the army. The Baroque portal was built between 1706 and 1708 by the Venetian architect [[Marino Gropelli]] (who also built St Blaise's church).\n\nIn 1418, the Republic of Ragusa, as Dubrovnik was then named, erected a statue of Roland (Ital.

He debuted for them in 1919 and became Kiwi number 125<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kiwis Roll of Honour\n| publisher = New Zealand Rugby League\n| url =https://nzrl.co.nz/kiwis-home/past-kiwis/\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921. In 1922 he made an effort to establish Rugby League in the Tauranga area which failed however he did play matches for Tauranga and a Bay of Plenty league team who played against Auckland and the touring [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] team.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Harriet and Albert Iles, whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League and Rugby Union Playing Career==\n===Auckland and New Zealand Rugby League===\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The following season he debuted for the Grafton senior team and played in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|Auckland first grade competition]]. He was fortunate to play alongside the likes of New Zealand rugby league legends [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Dougie McGregor]], the later having already played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] rugby team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game Notes and Comments\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 15915\n| date = 1915-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150512.2.124.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators. Auckland won 45-9 with Iles scoring a try in the corner \u201cafter a cross-field run\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nOnce again in [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Iles was a prolific try scorer for Newton notching 10 tries in total including tries in the Roope Rooster semi final against [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]], and the semi final replay against the same opponents when the first match was abandoned near the end after Ponsonby fans encroached on the field and refused to move. Newton went on to win the Roope Rooster for the first time in their clubs history<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Roope Rooster Competition/Final Won by Newton/Game Played in Downpour\n| page =4\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17253\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190901.2.9.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-20}}</ref>. \n\nIles was picked to play for Auckland against New Zealand on May 24. It was the first of 3 games he would play for them this season. The match was a warmup for the Australian Tour for the New Zealand side and was won by New Zealand 25-19 in front of 8,000 spectators at the [[Auckland Domain]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title =New Zealand Beats Auckland/Keenly Contested Game\n| page =9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17170\n| date = 1919-05-26\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190526.2.105.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His next appearance was against the Returned Soldiers team as part of the Peace Day celebration program. It was held at the Auckland Domain on July 20 and featured athletics, rugby union, rugby league, football, and hockey matches. The Returned Soldiers team won 26-24 with Iles scoring two second half tries for the losing Auckland team<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Northern Union Grade\n| page =9\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 172\n| date = 1919-07-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190722.2.130\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His last ever match in an Auckland jersey was played against [[Rugby League Hawkes Bay|Hawke\u2019s Bay]] at [[Eden Park]] on August 9 with 9,000 watching on. Iles scored two more tries. The first after receiving a pass from [[Bert Laing]] and \u201ccutting in neatly and scoring\u201d, while his second saw him picking up the ball in the open \u201coutpacing the opposition and swerving past McCarthy [to score] a good try\u201d<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Representative Match/Auckland V Hawke\u2019s Bay\n| page =9\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17235\n| date = 1911-08-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190811.2.111.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-18}}</ref>.\n\nIles was to make his [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] debut two weeks later. He played all of his 4 matches for New Zealand in 4 consecutive weekends. New Zealand had sent a touring team to [[Australia]] where they had played 11 matches against various teams but no tests<ref>{{cite news\n| title = All Blacks Tour 1919\n| publisher = Rugby League Project\n| url = https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/all-blacks-tour-1919/summary.html\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. After this tour they returned home and [[Australia national rugby league team|Australia]] sent a touring team to New Zealand<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kangaroos Tour 1919\n| publisher = Rugby League Project\n| url = https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/kangaroos-tour-1919/summary.html\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Iles had played in a trial on May 14 to make the tour but was not selected.\n\nOn August 23 he played his first test for New Zealand at the [[Basin Reserve]] in [[Wellington]] and went down 21-44 in front of 8,000 spectators<ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football/Australia V New Zealand\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Dominion, Volume 12, Issue 282\n| date = 1919-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DOM19190825.2.88\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Iles had a happier time of it in the second test which New Zealand won at Sydenham Park in [[Christchurch]]. Iles scored a try which was described \u201cfollowing an exchange of kicks between the two full-backs the New Zealanders swept down in a line and Iles got over\u201d, this made the score 21-2 to New Zealand. They would go on to win 26-10 in front of 6,000<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game/Australia v New Zealand/Visitors Outclassed\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Dominion, Volume 12, Issue 288\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DOM19190901.2.78\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The third test was played in Auckland at the Domain with a huge crowd of 24,300 present to see New Zealand go down 23-34<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Third League Test/Australia v New Zealand/Win for the Visitors/Score 34 Points to 23/Fast and Open Game\n| page = 9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17259\n| date = 1919-09-08\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190908.2.119\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n===Move to Tauranga and Switch to Rugby Union===\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In a bizarre situation Iles played for Auckland against his own Bay of Plenty union in a match on 31 July when an Auckland back was unable to make the trip to Tauranga and Iles was asked to take his place. Bay of Plenty won 17-10 but Iles played brilliantly and comment was made that he shouldn't have been left out of the Bay team in the first place\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Bay of Plenty Footballers Defeat Auckland Representatives\n| page =3\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume XLVIII, Issue 7464, 2 August 1920, Page 3\n| date = 1920-08-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19200802.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. In September Iles made a return to [[Eden Park]], this time in a Bay of Plenty rugby jersey where they were defeated 17-34 to Auckland. Iles set up Bay of Plenty\u2019s first try and then scored two himself<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Auckland V Bay of Plenty/The Visitors Defeated\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVII, Issue 17580\n| date = 1920-09-20\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19200920.2.106\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. \n\nIsles was playing for the Tauranga Football Club in the Jordan Cup competition for clubs and he also regularly appeared for the Tauranga representative team in Kusab Cup fixtures. His debut season in the code continued to be an impressive one. In a match for Tauranga against Te Puke in the Kusab Cup he ran in 3 tries in a 9-6 win\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Keen Football Contest in Te Puke on Saturday for the Kusab Cup\n| page =2\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume XLVIII, Issue 7474, 16 August 1920, Page 2\n| date = 1920-08-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19200816.2.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

The match was played at [[Rotorua]] with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the first try to David Werahiko Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\n===Effort to Introduce Rugby League to Tauranga===\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the [[Tauranga]] area in 1922. The Tauranga Rugby League was started and they looked to play rugby league teams from other areas. The league was officially formed in March, 1922 <ref>{{cite news| title = Under League Rules/Decisions of Executive\n| page = 3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LIX, Issue 18053, 30 March 1922, Page 3\n| date = 1922-03-30\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19220330.2.16.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee.

Tauranga took on the Rotorua team on the Tauranga Domain. As well as George Iles playing, David Borell and Arthur Iles also played in the match. Rotorua won a high scoring match 29-28 with both Iles and Borell scoring tries\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Rotorua Wins by One Point\n| page =4\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8092\n| date = 1922-09-18\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220918.2.24\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.\n\nA game against the touring [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] was also arranged which was a remarkable achievement in itself given that rugby league was not even played in the area until a month earlier. The match was between New South Wales and Bay of Plenty. George Iles naturally played and the team also featured future Kiwi [[George Gardiner (rugby league)|George Gardiner]] while the visiting NSW team featured the likes of [[Frank Burge]] and [[Reg Latta]]. New South Wales won the match 29 points to 5 with Borell scoring a try and Joseph Rogers kicking a goal for the local team\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Kangaroos 29 Bay of Plenty 5\n| page =4\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8101\n| date = 1922-09-28\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220928.2.33\n| accessdate = 2020-04-11}}</ref>.\n\nOn September 30 Tauranga again made history by playing in the first ever rugby league game in [[Te Puke]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.3\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. Efforts were then made to arrange a match with an Auckland team and this eventuated with Auckland sending a very strong team down to play in Tauranga on October 7. It wasn\u2019t a Tauranga side who took on Auckland rather a Bay of Plenty team with players from throughout the district. George Iles captained the Bay of Plenty side and they performed well only going down 27-33 to an Auckland team which featured a large number of New Zealand international players such as [[Clarrie Polson]], [[Wally Somers]], and future Kiwi\u2019s [[Lou Brown (rugby league)|Lou Brown]], [[Neville St George]], and [[James Lawrence O\u2019Brien|Jim Brown]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland League Team in Tauranga/Match Against Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| work = Bay of Plenty Times| volume=LI| issue=8109\n| date = 1922-10-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19221007.2.15\n| accessdate = 2020-03-11}}</ref>. Iles scored a try against his former team.\n\nIn September Iles went on the attack again, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League.

He debuted for them in 1919 and became Kiwi number 125<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kiwis Roll of Honour\n| publisher = New Zealand Rugby League\n| url =https://nzrl.co.nz/kiwis-home/past-kiwis/\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921. In 1922 he made an effort to establish Rugby League in the Tauranga area which failed however he did play matches for Tauranga and a Bay of Plenty league team who played against Auckland.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Harriet and Albert Iles, whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League and Rugby Union Playing Career==\n===Auckland and New Zealand Rugby League===\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The following season he debuted for the Grafton senior team and played in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|Auckland first grade competition]]. He was fortunate to play alongside the likes of New Zealand rugby league legends [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Dougie McGregor]], the later having already played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] rugby team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game Notes and Comments\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 15915\n| date = 1915-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150512.2.124.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators. Auckland won 45-9 with Iles scoring a try in the corner \u201cafter a cross-field run\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nOnce again in [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Iles was a prolific try scorer for Newton notching 10 tries in total including tries in the Roope Rooster semi final against [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]], and the semi final replay against the same opponents when the first match was abandoned near the end after Ponsonby fans encroached on the field and refused to move. Newton went on to win the Roope Rooster for the first time in their clubs history<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Roope Rooster Competition/Final Won by Newton/Game Played in Downpour\n| page =4\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17253\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190901.2.9.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-20}}</ref>. \n\nIles was picked to play for Auckland against New Zealand on May 24. It was the first of 3 games he would play for them this season. The match was a warmup for the Australian Tour for the New Zealand side and was won by New Zealand 25-19 in front of 8,000 spectators at the [[Auckland Domain]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title =New Zealand Beats Auckland/Keenly Contested Game\n| page =9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17170\n| date = 1919-05-26\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190526.2.105.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His next appearance was against the Returned Soldiers team as part of the Peace Day celebration program. It was held at the Auckland Domain on July 20 and featured athletics, rugby union, rugby league, football, and hockey matches. The Returned Soldiers team won 26-24 with Iles scoring two second half tries for the losing Auckland team<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Northern Union Grade\n| page =9\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 172\n| date = 1919-07-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190722.2.130\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His last ever match in an Auckland jersey was played against [[Rugby League Hawkes Bay|Hawke\u2019s Bay]] at [[Eden Park]] on August 9 with 9,000 watching on. Iles scored two more tries. The first after receiving a pass from [[Bert Laing]] and \u201ccutting in neatly and scoring\u201d, while his second saw him picking up the ball in the open \u201coutpacing the opposition and swerving past McCarthy [to score] a good try\u201d<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Representative Match/Auckland V Hawke\u2019s Bay\n| page =9\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17235\n| date = 1911-08-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190811.2.111.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-18}}</ref>.\n\nIles was to make his [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] debut two weeks later. He played all of his 4 matches for New Zealand in 4 consecutive weekends. New Zealand had sent a touring team to [[Australia]] where they had played 11 matches against various teams but no tests<ref>{{cite news\n| title = All Blacks Tour 1919\n| publisher = Rugby League Project\n| url = https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/all-blacks-tour-1919/summary.html\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Iles had played in a trial on May 14 to make the tour but was not selected.\n\nOn August 23 he played his first test for New Zealand at the [[Basin Reserve]] in [[Wellington]] and went down 21-44 in front of 8,000 spectators<ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football/Australia V New Zealand\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Dominion, Volume 12, Issue 282\n| date = 1919-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DOM19190825.2.88\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Iles had a happier time of it in the second test which New Zealand won at Sydenham Park in [[Christchurch]]. Iles scored a try which was described \u201cfollowing an exchange of kicks between the two full-backs the New Zealanders swept down in a line and Iles got over\u201d, this made the score 21-2 to New Zealand.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n===Move to Tauranga and Switch to Rugby Union===\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In a bizarre situation Iles played for Auckland against his own Bay of Plenty union in a match on 31 July when an Auckland back was unable to make the trip to Tauranga and Iles was asked to take his place. Bay of Plenty won 17-10 but Iles played brilliantly and comment was made that he shouldn't have been left out of the Bay team in the first place\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Bay of Plenty Footballers Defeat Auckland Representatives\n| page =3\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume XLVIII, Issue 7464, 2 August 1920, Page 3\n| date = 1920-08-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19200802.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

His debut season in the code continued to be an impressive one. In a match for Tauranga against Te Puke in the Kusab Cup he ran in 3 tries in a 9-6 win\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Keen Football Contest in Te Puke on Saturday for the Kusab Cup\n| page =2\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume XLVIII, Issue 7474, 16 August 1920, Page 2\n| date = 1920-08-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19200816.2.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

The match was played at [[Rotorua]] with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the first try to David Werahiko Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\n===Effort to Introduce Rugby League to Tauranga===\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the [[Tauranga]] area in 1922. The Tauranga Rugby League was started and they looked to play rugby league teams from other areas. The league was officially formed in March, 1922 <ref>{{cite news| title = Under League Rules/Decisions of Executive\n| page = 3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LIX, Issue 18053, 30 March 1922, Page 3\n| date = 1922-03-30\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19220330.2.16.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in [[Australia]] and [[Auckland]] than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Tauranga took on the Rotorua team on the Tauranga Domain. As well as George Iles playing, David Borell and Arthur Iles also played in the match. Rotorua won a high scoring match 29-28 with both Iles and Borell scoring tries\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Rotorua Wins by One Point\n| page =4\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8092\n| date = 1922-09-18\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220918.2.24\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.\n\nA game against the touring [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] was also arranged which was a remarkable achievement in itself given that rugby league was not even played in the area until a month earlier. The match was between New South Wales and Bay of Plenty. George Iles naturally played and the team also featured future Kiwi [[George Gardiner (rugby league)|George Gardiner]] while the visiting NSW team featured the likes of [[Frank Burge]] and [[Reg Latta]]. New South Wales won the match 29 points to 5 with Borell scoring a try and Joseph Rogers kicking a goal for the local team\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Kangaroos 29 Bay of Plenty 5\n| page =4\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8101\n| date = 1922-09-28\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220928.2.33\n| accessdate = 2020-04-11}}</ref>.\n\nOn September 30 Tauranga again made history by playing in the first ever rugby league game in [[Te Puke]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.3\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. Efforts were then made to arrange a match with an Auckland team and this eventuated with Auckland sending a very strong team down to play in Tauranga on October 7. It wasn\u2019t a Tauranga side who took on Auckland rather a Bay of Plenty team with players from throughout the district. George Iles captained the Bay of Plenty side and they performed well only going down 27-33 to an Auckland team which featured a large number of New Zealand international players such as [[Clarrie Polson]], [[Wally Somers]], and future Kiwi\u2019s [[Lou Brown (rugby league)|Lou Brown]], [[Neville St George]], and [[James Lawrence O\u2019Brien|Jim Brown]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland League Team in Tauranga/Match Against Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| work = Bay of Plenty Times| volume=LI| issue=8109\n| date = 1922-10-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19221007.2.15\n| accessdate = 2020-03-11}}</ref>. Iles scored a try against his former team.\n\nIn September Iles went on the attack again, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League.

His father is so rich that he hates even the smell of the poor, and despises anyone who talks about giving money as alms. Sri Krishna's family, too, doesn't mind the opulence they have. Coming from this family, he falls in love with Satya ([[Poorna]]), who thinks the rich become richer by exploiting the poor. In order to make Satya fall for him, Krishna starts acting as a poor chap, with a poor family. He buys his way out to show Satya that he helps the poor, and unintentionally becomes their savior of sorts. When Satya accepts his love, he recruits his family to help him convince her completely. So the rich father becomes a banana seller, rich mother becomes a bajji seller, etc. However, it turns out that Satya is the daughter of Nagineedu (Nagineedu) a factionist from Kurnool who has a rivalry with another faction leader Venkatappa([[Jaya Prakash Reddy]]). She urges her father to share his riches with his followers, an idea which his father doesn't take. But on knowing that she wants to marry a poor boy, he doesn't mind it. In order to get them married Krishna asks her father to act as a Head Master. Both families in their disguises respectively meet and arrange the marriage of Krishna and Satya.

His father is so rich that he hates even the smell of the poor, and despises anyone who talks about giving money as alms. Sri Krishna's family, too, doesn't mind the opulence they have. Coming from this family, he falls in love with Satya ([[Poorna]]), who thinks the rich become richer by exploiting the poor. In order to make Satya fall for him, Krishna starts acting as a poor chap, with a poor family. He buys his way out to show Satya that he helps the poor, and unintentionally becomes their savior of sorts. When Satya accepts his love, he recruits his family to help him convince her completely. So the rich father becomes a banana seller, rich mother becomes a bajji seller, etc. However, it turns out that Satya is the daughter of Nagineedu (Nagineedu) a factionist from Kurnool who has a rivalry with another faction leader Venkatappa([[Jaya Prakash Reddy]]). She urges her father to share his riches with his followers, an idea which his father doesn't take. But on knowing that she wants to get married to a poor boy, he doesn't mind it. In order to get them married Krishna asks her father to act as a Head Master. Both families in their disguises respectively meet and arrange the marriage of Krishna and Satya. Faction leader Venkatappa attacks the family of GK to kill Nagineedu. Knowing the truth about Nagineedu, GK is angered and cancels the marriage. Krishna uses his brain to try to help resolve issues between Venkatappa and Nagineedu and also convinces his father GK for the marriage.
