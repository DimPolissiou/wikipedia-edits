Mary Mahy, a formerly homeless woman, had created the Harvest for the Hungry program and was receptive to the idea of a free medical clinic.  With her support and assistance, the UCSD Student-Run Free Clinic Project gained access to several rooms in the church that they could use during the evenings.  Thus, the first UCSD Student-Run Free Clinic site was opened at the Pacific Beach United Methodist Church on in January 1997.  On that first night, 10 patients came seeking aid and over the next few months the clinic became very busy.\n\nA minister from the First Lutheran Church in Downtown San Diego, who was passionate about social justice and serving the homeless, heard about the free clinic that had started in Pacific Beach.  He approached Dr. Beck and asked if a second site could be started at his church.  This coincided with rising student interest for the project and with a sufficient number of medical student volunteers, a second site was opened in October 1997.\n\nThe medical students then became interested in reaching out to underserved minority populations.  Initially, Dr. Beck approached an inner city church.  Though the congregation was primarily middle-class, the pastor of the church referred Dr. Beck to his wife, Dr. Louilyn Hargett, who was the leader at Baker Elementary School.  Dr. Hargett along with the school's principal, Krisi Dean, welcomed the creation of a clinic and became partners with the UCSD Student-Run Free Clinic Project.  During 1998, the San Diego Unified School District approved the request to use school buildings for a medical clinic.  It was the school board's hope that the clinic would help to affirm the idea that school was at the center of the community.

The Community Law Project addresses all areas of law related to the indigent client, with more emphasis being in the areas of Family, Consumer, Administrative, and Immigration law.

A medical student or a team of medical students conduct a comprehensive interview including information about the patient's present condition, [[history of the present illness]], social and [[family history]].  A physical examination on the patient is also performed.  The medical student(s) then presents the patient's case to an [[attending physician]] and together they talk with the patient.  The attending, medical student and patient collaborate to determine the best course of action.  If needed, medications are ordered from the pharmacy and are then dispensed to the patient.<ref>{{cite web |title = UCSD Student-Run Free Clinic Project Project: Clinic Sites|url =http://meded.ucsd.edu/freeclinic/clinicsites.html|accessdate= 2008-07-05}}</ref>\n\n===Pacific Beach United Methodist Church (PB)===\n1561 Thomas Street<br>\nSan Diego, CA 92109\n\n===First Lutheran Church (Downtown)===\n1420 Third Avenue<br>\nSan Diego, CA 92101\n\n===Baker Elementary School (Baker)===\n4041 T Street<br>\nSan Diego, CA 92113\n\n===Golden Avenue Elementary (Golden Avenue)===\n8025 Lincoln Street<br>\nLemon Grove, CA 91945\n\n==Nationwide impact==\nThe UCSD Student-Run Free Clinic Project created a national faculty development program in 1999 called, \"Addressing the Health Needs of the Underserved\" with grant funding.

A physical examination on the patient is also performed.  The medical student(s) then presents the patient's case to an [[attending physician]] and together they talk with the patient.

After encountering a group of [[Apache]] prisoners under the care of a [[racist]] [[US Army]] [[sergeant]] and his men and giving them some water, Billy speaks with a friend about a possible job position far from there. When he's out he discovers that all the Indians were murdered save for one girl taken as [[sex slave]] for the [[soldiers]].\n\nBilly follows the soldiers in search for the girl that he wants to save, finding that she escape on her own. After earning her trust, both Billy and the Indian girl named Flower travel together. They come across a cabin where Billy avoids an ambush by the owner and his son, keeping them both at hand with his shotgun. Decided to take some goods from the cabin, the owners offer to sell what he want for money or in exchange of sex with Flower, which he reacts angrily, forcing them to run. \n\nBilly and Flower keep their march together in the wilderness using only Billy's horse, until they found a [[wild horse]] that Billy domesticates. They fall in love soon after and make love. Then they're found by the Sergeant and his men who were alerted of their whereabouts by the cabin owners. They beat-up Billy and tied him to a trunk, kill the wild horse, then proceed to [[gang-rape]] Flower, and steal the remaining horse.\n\nAfter they leave, Flower releases Billy of his bindings, but when he separates from her temporary she commits [[suicide]]. Heartbroken, Billy buries Flower and searches for vengeance.\n\nBilly follow the soldiers ambushing them in the middle of the night and kills them. After that he returns to the town willing to take the job his friend offer him in order to leave forever the gunslinger life. When he's leaving the place, he's shot by the owners of the cabin.
