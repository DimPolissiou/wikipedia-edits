When the summer comes to an end, Sandy\u2014who is going back to Australia\u2014frets that they may never meet again, but Danny tells her that their love is \"only beginning\". The film moves to the start of the seniors' term at Rydell High School. Danny is a member and leader of the T-Birds [[greaser (subculture)|greaser]] gang, consisting of his best friend Kenickie, Doody, Sonny, and Putzie. The Pink Ladies, a clique of greaser girls, also arrive, consisting of leader Rizzo, Frenchy, Marty, and Jan.\n\nAfter her parents decide not to return to Australia, Sandy enrolls at Rydell and is befriended by Frenchy, who considers dropping out of school to become a beautician. Unaware of each other's presence at Rydell, Danny and Sandy tell their respective groups the accounts of events during the pair's brief romance, without initially mentioning the other's name (\"Summer Nights\"). Sandy's version emphasizes the romance of the relationship, while Danny's version is more sexual.\n\nWhen Sandy finally says Danny's name, Rizzo arranges a surprise reunion for the two, but Danny is forced to maintain his bad-boy attitude in front of his pals, upsetting Sandy, who storms off and begins dating Tom, a [[jock (subculture)|jock]]. Kenickie unveils the used car, Greased Lightnin', that he plans on restoring and racing (\"Greased Lightnin'\"). Frenchy invites the girls to a pajama party, but Sandy falls ill from the sight of blood after getting her ears pierced by Frenchy, Rizzo starts to make fun of Sandy (\"Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee\"). While Sandy is outside, she soon starts to think of Danny, and how much she loves him even though he hurt her (\"Hopelessly Devoted to You\"). Rizzo departs to have sex with Kenickie, during which his condom breaks. The two are disturbed by Leo, leader of the T-Birds' rival gang, the Scorpions, and his girlfriend Cha-Cha.\n\nIn an attempt to impress Sandy, Danny turns to Coach Calhoun to get into sports, eventually becoming a runner. He reunites with Sandy and they attempt to go on a date, but their friends crash it. Kenickie and a distressed Rizzo argue and split up. Left alone, Frenchy is visited by a [[guardian angel]] who advises her to return to school after a mishap in beauty class leaves her with candy-pink hair (\"Beauty School Dropout\").\n\nThe school dance arrives, broadcast live on television and hosted by DJ Vince Fontaine, who flirts with Marty. Rizzo and Kenickie attempt to spite one another by bringing Leo and Cha-Cha as their dates. Danny and Sandy arrive together and dance well during the chaotic [[hand jive]] contest (\"Born to Hand Jive\"); just before the end of the contest Sonny pulls Sandy off the dance floor, and Cha-Cha cuts in to win the contest with Danny, causing Sandy to leave the event broken-hearted.\n\nDanny tries to make it up to Sandy by taking her to a drive-in theater (\"Alone at the Drive-in Movies\") but forces himself on her, causing Sandy to leave (\"Sandy\"). Meanwhile Rizzo fears she is pregnant after missing a period and confides in Marty, but Marty tells Sonny and he inadvertently spreads the rumor to Kenickie, the apparent father, though Rizzo denies this to him. At school, Rizzo is getting laughed at by other girls, and she soon realizes that she isn't as tough as she seems (\"There Are Worse Things I Could Do\").\n\nOn race day, Kenickie suffers a concussion when hit by his own car door, so Danny takes the wheel. He and Leo race until Leo crashes and leaves humiliated, with Danny as the victor. Sandy watches from afar, concluding she still loves Danny, and decides to change her attitude and look to impress him; she then asks Frenchy for help to achieve this goal (\"Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee (Reprise)\").\n\nOn the last day of school, Principal McGee and her assistant Blanche sob about the departing class.

He made a number of casting recommendations that Stigwood ultimately accepted, including suggesting [[Randal Kleiser]] (who had never directed a theatrical feature before this but had directed Travolta in the 1976 telefilm ''[[The Boy in the Plastic Bubble]]'') as director, and [[Olivia Newton-John]], then known almost exclusively as a multiple Grammy winning pop and country singer, as Sandy.<ref>{{cite web|last=Travolta|first=John|title=Inside the Actor's Studio}}</ref> Newton-John had done little acting before this film, with only two film credits (1965's ''[[Funny Things Happen Down Under]]'' and the unreleased 1970 film ''[[Toomorrow (film)|Toomorrow]]'', which predated her singing breakthrough) to her name up to that time.

When Carr saw the footage of the scene with Coca-Cola products and signage, he ordered director Randal Kleiser to either reshoot the scene with Pepsi products or remove the Coca-Cola logos from the scene. As reshoots were deemed too expensive and time-consuming, optical mattes were used to cover up or blur out the Coca-Cola references. The 'blurring' covered up trademarked menu signage and a large wall poster, but a red cooler with the logo could not be sufficiently altered so was left unchanged.

When the summer comes to an end, Sandy\u2014who is going back to Australia\u2014frets that they may never meet again, but Danny tells her that their love is \"only beginning\". The film moves to the start of the seniors' term at Rydell High School. Danny is a member and leader of the T-Birds [[greaser (subculture)|greaser]] gang, consisting of his best friend Kenickie, Doody, Sonny, and Putzie. The Pink Ladies, a clique of greaser girls, also arrive, consisting of leader Rizzo, Frenchy, Marty, and Jan.\n\nAfter her parents decide not to return to Australia, Sandy enrolls at Rydell and is befriended by Frenchy, who considers dropping out of school to become a beautician. Unaware of each other's presence at Rydell, Danny and Sandy tell their respective groups the accounts of events during the pair's brief romance, without initially mentioning the other's name (\"Summer Nights\"). Sandy's version emphasizes the romance of the relationship, while Danny's version is more sexual.\n\nWhen Sandy finally says Danny's name, Rizzo arranges a surprise reunion for the two, but Danny is forced to maintain his bad-boy attitude in front of his pals, upsetting Sandy, who storms off and begins dating Tom, a [[jock (subculture)|jock]]. Kenickie unveils the used car, Greased Lightnin', that he plans on restoring and racing (\"Greased Lightnin'\"). Frenchy invites the girls to a pajama party, but Sandy falls ill from the sight of blood after getting her ears pierced by Frenchy, Rizzo starts to make fun of Sandy (\"Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee\"). While Sandy is outside, she soon starts to think of Danny, and how much she loves him even though he hurt her (\"Hopelessly Devoted to You\"). Rizzo departs to have sex with Kenickie, during which his condom breaks. The two are disturbed by Leo, leader of the T-Birds' rival gang, the Scorpions, and his girlfriend Cha-Cha.\n\nIn an attempt to impress Sandy, Danny turns to Coach Calhoun to get into sports, eventually becoming a runner. He reunites with Sandy and they attempt to go on a date, but their friends crash it. Kenickie and a distressed Rizzo argue and split up. Left alone, Frenchy is visited by a [[guardian angel]] who advises her to return to school after a mishap in beauty class leaves her with candy-pink hair (\"Beauty School Dropout\").\n\nThe school dance arrives, broadcast live on television and hosted by DJ Vince Fontaine, who flirts with Marty. Rizzo and Kenickie attempt to spite one another by bringing Leo and Cha-Cha as their dates. Danny and Sandy arrive together and dance well during the chaotic [[hand jive]] contest (\"Born to Hand Jive\"); just before the end of the contest Sonny pulls Sandy off the dance floor, and Cha-Cha cuts in to win the contest with Danny, causing Sandy to leave the event broken-hearted.\n\nDanny tries to make it up to Sandy by taking her to a drive-in theater (\"Alone at the Drive-in Movies\") but forces himself on her, causing Sandy to leave (\"Sandy\"). Meanwhile Rizzo fears she is pregnant after missing a period and confides in Marty, but Marty tells Sonny and he inadvertently spreads the rumor to Kenickie, the apparent father, though Rizzo denies this to him. At school, Rizzo is getting laughed at by other girls, and she soon realizes that she isn't as tough as she seems (\"There Are Worse Things I Could Do\").\n\nOn race day, Kenickie suffers a concussion when hit by his own car door, so Danny takes the wheel. He and Leo race until Leo crashes and leaves humiliated, with Danny as the victor. Sandy watches from afar, concluding she still loves Danny, and decides to change her attitude and look to impress him; she then asks Frenchy for help to achieve this goal (\"Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee (Reprise)\").\n\nOn the last day of school, Principal McGee and her assistant Blanche sob about the departing class. Rizzo discovers she is not pregnant and reunites with Kenickie. Danny has lettered in track but is shocked when Sandy arrives dressed as a female T-Bird. In song (\"You're the One That I Want\"), they confess their mutual love and reconcile. The class celebrates their graduation at the fair on school grounds (\"We Go Together\"). Sandy and Danny depart in Greased Lightnin', which takes flight (\"Grease\").\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Principal cast===\n* [[John Travolta]] as Danny Zuko, who lives a double life as leader of the greaser gang the T-Birds and as Sandy's boyfriend\n* [[Olivia Newton-John]] as Sandy Olsson, Danny's girlfriend and an Australian [[immigrant]] and [[ing\u00e9nue]], who transforms from square to greaser\n* [[Stockard Channing]] as Betty Rizzo, Kenickie's girlfriend and the cynical leader of the Pink Ladies clique\n* [[Jeff Conaway]] as Kenickie Murdoch, Danny's best friend, Rizzo's boyfriend and the owner of Greased Lightnin'\n* [[Barry Pearl]] as Doody, a member of the T-Birds; he pairs with Frenchy at the school dance\n* [[Michael Tucci]] as Sonny, a trouble-making wannabe womanizer and T-Bird who courts Marty with little success over the course of the film\n* [[Kelly Ward]] as Putzie, a member of the T-Birds whose relationship with Jan builds over the course of the film\n* [[Didi Conn]] as Frenchy, Sandy's closest friend in the Pink Ladies and an aspiring beautician\n* [[Jamie Donnelly]] as Jan, a quirky member of the Pink Ladies with a liking for [[Ipana]] toothpaste\n* [[Dinah Manoff]] as Marty Maraschino, a member of the Pink Ladies whose attractiveness regularly draws the attention of men, including Sonny and Vince Fontaine\n\n===Secondary cast===\n* [[Eve Arden]] as Principal McGee, who shows discomfort at the goings-on at Rydell High.\n* [[Dody Goodman]] as Secretary Blanche Hodel, who enjoys even the wilder antics at the school.\n* [[Sid Caesar]] as Coach Vince Calhoun, the tough-talking gym teacher and coach of all the school's perennially losing sports teams\n* [[Eddie Deezen]] as Eugene Felsnic, the class nerd\n* [[Susan Buckner]] as Patty Simcox, the head cheerleader and a rival for Danny's affections\n* [[Lorenzo Lamas]] as Tom Chisum, a popular jock who competes for Sandy's affections\n* [[Dennis Cleveland Stewart|Dennis C.

He made a number of casting recommendations that Stigwood ultimately accepted, including suggesting [[Randal Kleiser]] (who had never directed a theatrical feature before this but had directed Travolta in the 1976 telefilm ''[[The Boy in the Plastic Bubble]]'') as director, and [[Olivia Newton-John]], then known almost exclusively as a multiple Grammy winning pop and country singer, as Sandy.<ref>{{cite web|last=Travolta|first=John|title=Inside the Actor's Studio}}</ref> Newton-John had done little acting before this film, with only two film credits (1965's ''[[Funny Things Happen Down Under]]'' and the unreleased 1970 film ''[[Toomorrow (film)|Toomorrow]]'', which predated her singing breakthrough) to her name up to that time. Before accepting the role, Newton-John requested a [[screen test]] for ''Grease'' to avoid another career setback.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20071391,00.html |title=Ohh Sandy! \u2013 Olivia Newton-John |work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |first=Robert |last=Windeler |date=July 31, 1978 |accessdate=November 10, 2008}}</ref> The screen test was done with the drive-in movie scene. Newton-John, who is native to England and lived most of her life in Australia, was unable to perform with a convincing American accent, and thus her character was rewritten to be Australian. Before Newton-John was hired, [[Allan Carr]] was considering numerous names such as [[Ann-Margret]], [[Susan Dey]] and [[Marie Osmond]] for the lead role; Newton-John agreed to a reduced asking price in exchange for star billing.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> In a case of life imitating art, Newton-John's own musical career would undergo a transformation similar to that of the Sandy Olsson character; her next album after ''Grease'', the provocatively titled ''[[Totally Hot]]'', featured a much more sexual and pop-oriented approach, with Newton-John appearing on the album cover in similar all-leather attire and teased hair.<ref name=\"google3\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Mo7xm-X1r4C&pg=PA334#PPA335,M1 |title=All music guide to country: the ... |publisher= Google Books |date= |accessdate=August 13, 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[Jeff Conaway]], like Travolta, had previously appeared in the stage version of ''Grease''; he had played Danny Zuko during the show's run on Broadway.<ref name=newsdayobit>{{cite news|authorlink=Frank Lovece |last=Lovece |first=Frank |url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/obituaries/grease-taxi-star-jeff-conaway-dies-1.2907909 |title='Grease,' 'Taxi' Star Jeff Conaway Dies |work=[[Newsday]] |date=May 27, 2011 |url-status=live|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5z4Hujzwq?url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/obituaries/grease-taxi-star-jeff-conaway-dies-1.2907909?p= |archivedate=May 30, 2011 |df= }} (Subscription required.) .

The drive-in movie scenes were shot at the Burbank Pickwick Drive-In (it was closed and torn down in 1989 and a shopping center took its place).

When Carr saw the footage of the scene with Coca-Cola products and signage, he ordered director Randal Kleiser to either reshoot the scene with Pepsi products or remove the Coca-Cola logos from the scene. As reshoots were deemed too expensive and time-consuming, optical mattes were used to cover up or blur out the Coca-Cola references. The 'blurring' covered up trademarked menu signage and a large wall poster, but a red cooler with the logo could not be sufficiently altered so was left unchanged. According to Kleiser, \"We just had to hope that Pepsi wouldn't complain.

The illustration incorporates many examples of optical phenomena including perspective effects, the rainbow, mirrors, and refraction.]]\nTwo major theories on vision prevailed in [[classical antiquity]]. The first theory, the [[Emission theory (vision)|emission theory]], was supported by such thinkers as [[Euclid]] and [[Ptolemy]], who believed that sight worked by the [[eye]] emitting [[Ray (optics)|rays]] of [[light]]. The second theory, the intromission theory supported by [[Aristotle]] and his followers, had physical forms entering the eye from an object. Previous Islamic writers (such as [[al-Kindi]]) had argued essentially on Euclidean, Galenist, or Aristotelian lines. The strongest influence on the ''Book of Optics'' was from Ptolemy's [[Ptolemy#Optics|''Optics'']], while the description of the anatomy and physiology of the eye was based on Galen's account.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|2001|p=lxxix}}.</ref> Alhazen's achievement was to come up with a theory that successfully combined parts of the mathematical ray arguments of Euclid, the medical tradition of [[Galen]], and the intromission theories of Aristotle. Alhazen's intromission theory followed al-Kindi (and broke with Aristotle) in asserting that \"from each point of every colored body, illuminated by any light, issue light and color along every straight line that can be drawn from that point\".<ref name=\"{{harvnb|lindberg|1976|p=73}}.\">{{harvnb|Lindberg|1976|p=73}}.</ref> This however left him with the problem of explaining how a coherent image was formed from many independent sources of radiation; in particular, every point of an object would send rays to every point on the eye. What Alhazen needed was for each point on an object to correspond to one point only on the eye.<ref name=\"{{harvnb|lindberg|1976|p=73}}.\"/> He attempted to resolve this by asserting that the eye would only perceive perpendicular rays from the object\u2014for any one point on the eye, only the ray that reached it directly, without being refracted by any other part of the eye, would be perceived. He argued, using a physical analogy, that perpendicular rays were stronger than oblique rays: in the same way that a ball thrown directly at a board might break the board, whereas a ball thrown obliquely at the board would glance off, perpendicular rays were stronger than refracted rays, and it was only perpendicular rays which were perceived by the eye. As there was only one perpendicular ray that would enter the eye at any one point, and all these rays would converge on the centre of the eye in a cone, this allowed him to resolve the problem of each point on an object sending many rays to the eye; if only the perpendicular ray mattered, then he had a one-to-one correspondence and the confusion could be resolved.<ref>{{harv|Lindberg|1976|p=74}}</ref> He later asserted (in book seven of the ''Optics'') that other rays would be refracted through the eye and perceived ''as if'' perpendicular.<ref>{{harv|Lindberg|1976|p=76}}</ref>\n\nHis arguments regarding perpendicular rays do not clearly explain why ''only'' perpendicular rays were perceived; why would the weaker oblique rays not be perceived more weakly?<ref>{{harvnb|Lindberg|1976|p=75}}</ref> His later argument that refracted rays would be perceived as if perpendicular does not seem persuasive.<ref>{{harvnb|Lindberg|1976|pages=76\u201378}}</ref> However, despite its weaknesses, no other theory of the time was so comprehensive, and it was enormously influential, particularly in Western Europe. Directly or indirectly, his ''De Aspectibus'' ([[Book of Optics]]) inspired much activity in optics between the 13th and 17th centuries.<ref name=\"{{harvnb|lindberg|1976|p=86}}.\">{{harvnb|Lindberg|1976|p=86}}.</ref> [[Kepler]]'s later theory of the [[retina]]l image (which resolved the problem of the correspondence of points on an object and points in the eye) built directly on the conceptual framework of Alhazen.<ref name=\"{{harvnb|lindberg|1976|p=86}}.\"/>\n\nAlhazen showed through experiment that light travels in straight lines, and carried out various experiments with [[lens (optics)|lenses]], [[mirror]]s, [[refraction]], and [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{harvnb|Al Deek|2004}}.</ref> His analyses of reflection and refraction considered the vertical and horizontal components of light rays separately.<ref>{{harvnb|Heeffer|2003}}.</ref>\n\nThe [[camera obscura]] was known to the [[History of Science and Technology in China|ancient Chinese]], and was described by the [[Han Chinese]] [[polymath]]ic [[genius]] [[Shen Kuo]] in his scientific book ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'', published in the year 1088 C.E. Aristotle had discussed the basic principle behind it in his ''Problems'', but Alhazen's work also contained the first clear description, outside of [[History of science and technology in China|China]], of [[camera obscura]] in the areas of the [[middle east]], [[Europe]], [[Africa]] and [[India]].<ref>{{harvnb|Kelley|Milone|Aveni|2005|p=83}}: \"The first clear description of the device appears in the ''Book of Optics'' of Alhazen.\"</ref> and early analysis<ref>{{harvtxt|Wade|Finger|2001}}: \"The principles of the camera obscura first began to be correctly analysed in the eleventh century, when they were outlined by Ibn al-Haytham.\"</ref> of the device.\n\nAlhazen used his [[camera obscura]] to observe the eclipse. In his essay \"On the Form of the Eclipse\" he writes that he observed the sickle-like shape of the sun at the time of an eclipse. The introduction to his essay reads as follows: The image of the sun at the time of the eclipse, unless it is total, demonstrates that when its light passes through a narrow, round hole and is cast on a plane opposite to the hole it takes on the form of a moonsickle. His findings solidified the importance in the history of the [[camera obscura]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of Photography|last=Eder|first=Josef|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1945|location=New York|pages=37}}</ref>\n\nAlhazen studied the process of sight, the structure of the eye, image formation in the eye, and the [[visual system]]. Ian P. Howard argued in a 1996 ''[[Perception (journal)|Perception]]'' article that Alhazen should be credited with many discoveries and theories previously attributed to Western Europeans writing centuries later. For example, he described what became in the 19th century [[Hering's law of equal innervation]]. He wrote a description of vertical [[horopter]]s 600 years before [[Aguilonius]] that is actually closer to the modern definition than Aguilonius's\u2014and his work on [[binocular disparity]] was repeated by Panum in 1858.<ref>{{harvnb|Howard|1996}}.</ref> Craig Aaen-Stockdale, while agreeing that Alhazen should be credited with many advances, has expressed some caution, especially when considering Alhazen in isolation from [[Ptolemy]], with whom Alhazen was extremely familiar. Alhazen corrected a significant error of Ptolemy regarding binocular vision, but otherwise his account is very similar; Ptolemy also attempted to explain what is now called Hering's law.<ref>{{harvnb|Aaen-Stockdale|2008}}</ref> In general, Alhazen built on and expanded the optics of Ptolemy.<ref>{{harvnb|Wade|1998|pages=240,316,334,367}}; {{harvnb|Howard|Wade|1996|pages=1195,1197,1200}}.</ref> In a more detailed account of Ibn al-Haytham's contribution to the study of binocular vision based on Lejeune<ref>{{harvnb|Lejeune|1958}}.</ref> and Sabra,<ref name=\"{{harvnb|sabra|1989}}.\">{{harvnb|Sabra|1989}}.</ref> Raynaud<ref>{{harvnb|Raynaud|2003}}.</ref> showed that the concepts of correspondence, homonymous and crossed diplopia were in place in Ibn al-Haytham's optics. But contrary to Howard, he explained why Ibn al-Haytham did not give the circular figure of the horopter and why, by reasoning experimentally, he was in fact closer to the discovery of Panum's fusional area than that of the Vieth-M\u00fcller circle. In this regard, Ibn al-Haytham's theory of binocular vision faced two main limits: the lack of recognition of the role of the retina, and obviously the lack of an experimental investigation of ocular tracts.\n\n[[File:Alhazen1652.png|left|thumb|upright|The structure of the [[human eye]] according to Ibn al-Haytham.

It comprises drawing lines from two points in the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] of a circle meeting at a point on the [[circumference]] and making equal angles with the [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] at that point. This is equivalent to finding the point on the edge of a circular [[billiard table]] at which a player must aim a cue ball at a given point to make it bounce off the table edge and hit another ball at a second given point. Thus, its main application in optics is to solve the problem, \"Given a light source and a spherical mirror, find the point on the mirror where the light will be reflected to the eye of an observer.\" This leads to an [[Quartic equation|equation of the fourth degree]].<ref>\n{{harvnb|O'Connor|Robertson|1999}}, {{harvnb|Weisstein|2008}}.</ref> This eventually led Alhazen to derive a formula for the sum of [[fourth power]]s, where previously only the formulas for the sums of squares and cubes had been stated. His method can be readily generalized to find the formula for the sum of any integral powers, although he did not himself do this (perhaps because he only needed the fourth power to calculate the volume of the paraboloid he was interested in). He used his result on sums of integral powers to perform what would now be called an [[Integral|integration]], where the formulas for the sums of integral squares and fourth powers allowed him to calculate the volume of a [[paraboloid]].<ref>{{harvnb|Katz|1995|pp=165\u20139 &amp; 173\u20134}}.</ref> Alhazen eventually solved the problem using [[conic section]]s and a geometric proof. His solution was extremely long and complicated and may not have been understood by mathematicians reading him in Latin translation. \nLater mathematicians used [[Descartes]]' analytical methods to analyse the problem.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1992}}.</ref> An algebraic solution to the problem was finally found in 1965 by Jack M.

He conducted experiments with [[projectile]]s and concluded that only the impact of [[perpendicular]] projectiles on surfaces was forceful enough to make them penetrate, whereas surfaces tended to deflect [[Oblique angle|oblique]] projectile strikes. For example, to explain refraction from a rare to a dense medium, he used the mechanical analogy of an iron ball thrown at a thin slate covering a wide hole in a metal sheet. A perpendicular throw breaks the slate and passes through, whereas an oblique one with equal force and from an equal distance does not.<ref>{{harvnb|Russell|1996|p=695}}.</ref> He also used this result to explain how intense, direct light hurts the eye, using a mechanical analogy: Alhazen associated 'strong' lights with perpendicular rays and 'weak' lights with oblique ones.

Alhazen argued against Ptolemy's refraction theory, and defined the problem in terms of perceived, rather than real, enlargement. He said that judging the distance of an object depends on there being an uninterrupted sequence of intervening bodies between the object and the observer. When the Moon is high in the sky there are no intervening objects, so the Moon appears close. The perceived size of an object of constant angular size varies with its perceived distance. Therefore, the Moon appears closer and smaller high in the sky, and further and larger on the horizon. Through works by [[Roger Bacon]], [[John Pecham]] and Witelo based on Alhazen's explanation, the Moon illusion gradually came to be accepted as a psychological phenomenon, with the refraction theory being rejected in the 17th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Hershenson|1989|pp=9\u201310}}.</ref> Although Alhazen is often credited with the perceived distance explanation, he was not the first author to offer it. [[Cleomedes]] ({{circa}} 2nd century) gave this account (in addition to refraction), and he credited it to [[Posidonius]] ({{circa}} 135\u201350 BC).<ref>{{harvnb|Ross|2000}}.</ref> Ptolemy may also have offered this explanation in his ''Optics'', but the text is obscure.<ref>{{harvnb|Ross|Ross|1976}}.</ref> Alhazen's writings were more widely available in the Middle Ages than those of these earlier authors, and that probably explains why Alhazen received the credit.\n\n== Other works on physics ==\n\n=== Optical treatises ===\n\nBesides the ''Book of Optics'', Alhazen wrote several other treatises on the same subject, including his ''Risala fi l-Daw''' (''Treatise on Light''). He investigated the properties of [[luminance]], the [[rainbow]], [[eclipse]]s, twilight, and [[moonlight]]. Experiments with mirrors and the refractive interfaces between air, water, and glass cubes, hemispheres, and quarter-spheres provided the foundation for his theories on [[catoptrics]].<ref name=\"{{harvnb|el-bizri|2006}}.\">{{harvnb|El-Bizri|2006}}.</ref>\n\n=== Celestial physics ===\nAlhazen discussed the [[physics]] of the celestial region in his ''Epitome of Astronomy'', arguing that Ptolemaic models must be understood in terms of physical objects rather than abstract hypotheses\u2014in other words that it should be possible to create physical models where (for example) none of the celestial bodies would collide with each other. The suggestion of mechanical models for the Earth centred [[Ptolemaic model]] \"greatly contributed to the eventual triumph of the Ptolemaic system among the Christians of the West\". Alhazen's determination to root astronomy in the realm of physical objects was important, however, because it meant astronomical hypotheses \"were accountable to the [[Physical law|laws of physics]]\", and could be criticised and improved upon in those terms.<ref>{{harvnb|Duhem|1969|p=28}}.</ref>\n\nHe also wrote ''Maqala fi daw al-qamar'' (''On the Light of the Moon'').\n\n=== Mechanics ===\n\nIn his work, Alhazen discussed theories on the [[Motion (physics)|motion]] of a body.<ref name=\"{{harvnb|el-bizri|2006}}.\"/> In his ''Treatise on Place'', Alhazen disagreed with [[Aristotle]]'s view that nature abhors a void, and he used [[geometry]] in an attempt to demonstrate that place (''al-makan'') is the imagined three-dimensional void between the inner surfaces of a containing body.<ref name=\"{{harvnb|el-bizri|2007}}.\">{{harvnb|El-Bizri|2007}}.</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Astronomy}}<!-- -Anchor for a wikilink in Celestial Spheres article.

It is stationary in its [the world's] middle, fixed in it and not moving in any direction nor moving with any of the varieties of motion, but always at rest.<ref>{{harvnb|Langermann|1990}}, chap. 2, sect. 22, p. 61</ref>}}\n\nThe book is a non-technical explanation of Ptolemy's [[Almagest]], which was eventually translated into [[Hebrew]] and [[Latin]] in the 13th and 14th centuries and subsequently had an influence on astronomers such as [[Georg von Peuerbach]]<ref name=\"{{harvnb|lorch|2008}}.\">{{harvnb|Lorch|2008}}.</ref> during the European [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]].<ref>{{harvnb|Langermann|1990|pp=34\u201341}}; {{harvnb|Gondhalekar|2001|p=21}}.</ref>\n\n=== ''Doubts Concerning Ptolemy'' ===\n\nIn his ''Al-Shuk\u016bk \u201bal\u0101 Batlamy\u016bs'', variously translated as ''Doubts Concerning Ptolemy'' or ''Aporias against Ptolemy'', published at some time between 1025 and 1028, Alhazen criticized [[Ptolemy]]'s ''Almagest'', ''Planetary Hypotheses'', and ''Optics'', pointing out various contradictions he found in these works, particularly in astronomy. Ptolemy's ''Almagest'' concerned mathematical theories regarding the motion of the planets, whereas the ''Hypotheses'' concerned what Ptolemy thought was the actual configuration of the planets. Ptolemy himself acknowledged that his theories and configurations did not always agree with each other, arguing that this was not a problem provided it did not result in noticeable error, but Alhazen was particularly scathing in his criticism of the inherent contradictions in Ptolemy's works.<ref name=\"{{harvnb|sabra|1998}}.\">{{harvnb|Sabra|1998}}.</ref> He considered that some of the mathematical devices Ptolemy introduced into astronomy, especially the [[equant]], failed to satisfy the physical requirement of uniform circular motion, and noted the absurdity of relating actual physical motions to imaginary mathematical points, lines and circles:<ref>{{harvnb|Langermann|1990|pp=8\u201310}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Ptolemy assumed an arrangement (''hay'a'') that cannot exist, and the fact that this arrangement produces in his imagination the motions that belong to the planets does not free him from the error he committed in his assumed arrangement, for the existing motions of the planets cannot be the result of an arrangement that is impossible to exist...  [F]or a man to imagine a circle in the heavens, and to imagine the planet moving in it does not bring about the planet's motion.<ref>{{harvnb|Sabra|1978b|p=121, n. 13}}</ref>}}\n\nHaving pointed out the problems, Alhazen appears to have intended to resolve the contradictions he pointed out in Ptolemy in a later work. Alhazen believed there was a \"true configuration\" of the planets that Ptolemy had failed to grasp. He intended to complete and repair Ptolemy's system, not to replace it completely.<ref name=\"{{harvnb|sabra|1998}}.\"/> In the ''Doubts Concerning Ptolemy'' Alhazen set out his views on the difficulty of attaining scientific knowledge and the need to question existing authorities and theories:\n\n{{quote|Truth is sought for itself [but] the truths, [he warns] are immersed in uncertainties [and the scientific authorities (such as Ptolemy, whom he greatly respected) are] not immune from error...<ref name=\"{{harvnb|sabra|1989}}.\"/>}}\n\nHe held that the criticism of existing theories\u2014which dominated this book\u2014holds a special place in the growth of scientific knowledge.\n\n=== ''Model of the Motions of Each of the Seven Planets'' ===\n\nAlhazen's ''The Model of the Motions of Each of the Seven Planets'' was written {{circa}} 1038. Only one damaged manuscript has been found, with only the introduction and the first section, on the theory of planetary motion, surviving. (There was also a second section on astronomical calculation, and a third section, on astronomical instruments.) Following on from his ''Doubts on Ptolemy'', Alhazen described a new, geometry-based planetary model, describing the motions of the planets in terms of spherical geometry, infinitesimal geometry and trigonometry. He kept a geocentric universe and assumed that celestial motions are uniformly circular, which required the inclusion of [[epicycles]] to explain observed motion, but he managed to eliminate Ptolemy's [[equant]]. In general, his model didn't try to provide a causal explanation of the motions, but concentrated on providing a complete, geometric description that could explain observed motions without the contradictions inherent in Ptolemy's model.<ref>{{harvnb|Rashed|2007}}.</ref>\n\n=== Other astronomical works ===\n\nAlhazen wrote a total of twenty-five astronomical works, some concerning technical issues such as ''Exact Determination of the Meridian'', a second group concerning accurate astronomical observation, a third group concerning various astronomical problems and questions such as the location of the [[Milky Way]]; Alhazen argued for a distant location, based on the fact that it does not move in relation to the fixed stars.<ref>{{harvnb|Mohamed|2000|pp=49\u201350}}</ref> The fourth group consists of ten works on astronomical theory, including the ''Doubts'' and ''Model of the Motions'' discussed above.<ref>{{harvnb|Rashed|2007|pp=8\u20139}}.</ref>\n\n== Mathematical works ==\n[[File:AlhazenSummation.png|thumb|150px|Alhazen's geometrically proven summation formula]]\nIn [[Islamic mathematics|mathematics]], Alhazen built on the mathematical works of [[Euclid]] and [[Thabit ibn Qurra]] and worked on \"the beginnings of the link between [[algebra]] and [[geometry]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Faruqi|2006|pp=395\u20136}}:\n{{quote|In seventeenth century Europe the problems formulated by Ibn al-Haytham (965\u20131041) became known as 'Alhazen's problem'. ...

Al-Haytham also worked on analytical geometry and the beginnings of the link between algebra and geometry.

He used this to find the volume of a [[paraboloid]]. He could find the integral formula for any polynomial without having developed a general formula.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2691411 |author=Katz, Victor J. |title=Ideas of Calculus in Islam and India |jstor=2691411 |journal=Mathematics Magazine |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=163\u2013174 |year=1995 }} [165\u20139, 173\u20134]</ref>\n\n== Other works ==\n\n=== ''Influence of Melodies on the Souls of Animals'' ===\n\nAlhazen also wrote a ''Treatise on the Influence of Melodies on the Souls of Animals'', although no copies have survived.

He carried out a detailed scientific study of the annual [[inundation]] of the Nile River, and he drew plans for building a [[dam]], at the site of the modern-day [[Aswan Dam]].

He was voiced by [[Alfred Molina]] in the episode.\n\nOver forty years previously, [[Jacob Bronowski]] presented Alhazen's work in a similar television documentary (and the corresponding book), ''[[The Ascent of Man]]''. In episode 5 (''The Music of the Spheres''), Bronowski remarked that in his view, Alhazen was \"the one really original scientific mind that Arab culture produced\", whose theory of optics was not improved on till the time of Newton and Leibniz.\n\nH. J. J. Winter, a British historian of science, summing up the importance of Ibn al-Haytham in the history of [[physics]] wrote:\n<blockquote>After the death of Archimedes no really great physicist appeared until Ibn al-Haytham. If, therefore, we confine our interest only to the history of physics, there is a long period of over twelve hundred years during which the Golden Age of Greece gave way to the era of Muslim Scholasticism, and the experimental spirit of the noblest physicist of Antiquity lived again in the Arab Scholar from Basra.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Winter |first1=H.

Most of his works are now lost, but more than 50 of them have survived to some extent. Nearly half of his surviving works are on mathematics, 23 of them are on astronomy, and 14 of them are on optics, with a few on other subjects.<ref>{{harvnb|Rashed|2002a|p=773}}.</ref> Not all his

The illustration incorporates many examples of optical phenomena including perspective effects, the rainbow, mirrors, and refraction.]]\nTwo major theories on vision prevailed in [[classical antiquity]]. The first theory, the [[Emission theory (vision)|emission theory]], was supported by such thinkers as [[Euclid]] and [[Ptolemy]], who believed that sight worked by the [[eye]] emitting [[Ray (optics)|rays]] of [[light]]. The second theory, the intromission theory supported by [[Aristotle]] and his followers, had physical forms entering the eye from an object. Previous Islamic writers (such as [[al-Kindi]]) had argued essentially on Euclidean, Galenist, or Aristotelian lines. The strongest influence on the ''Book of Optics'' was from Ptolemy's [[Ptolemy#Optics|''Optics'']], while the description of the anatomy and physiology of the eye was based on Galen's account.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|2001|p=lxxix}}.</ref> Alhazen's achievement was to come up with a theory that successfully combined parts of the mathematical ray arguments of Euclid, the medical tradition of [[Galen]], and the intromission theories of Aristotle. Alhazen's intromission theory followed al-Kindi (and broke with Aristotle) in asserting that \"from each point of every colored body, illuminated by any light, issue light and color along every straight line that can be drawn from that point\".<ref name=\"{{harvnb|lindberg|1976|p=73}}.\">{{harvnb|Lindberg|1976|p=73}}.</ref> This however left him with the problem of explaining how a coherent image was formed from many independent sources of radiation; in particular, every point of an object would send rays to every point on the eye. What Alhazen needed was for each point on an object to correspond to one point only on the eye.<ref name=\"{{harvnb|lindberg|1976|p=73}}.\"/> He attempted to resolve this by asserting that the eye would only perceive perpendicular rays from the object\u2014for any one point on the eye, only the ray that reached it directly, without being refracted by any other part of the eye, would be perceived. He argued, using a physical analogy, that perpendicular rays were stronger than oblique rays: in the same way that a ball thrown directly at a board might break the board, whereas a ball thrown obliquely at the board would glance off, perpendicular rays were stronger than refracted rays, and it was only perpendicular rays which were perceived by the eye. As there was only one perpendicular ray that would enter the eye at any one point, and all these rays would converge on the centre of the eye in a cone, this allowed him to resolve the problem of each point on an object sending many rays to the eye; if only the perpendicular ray mattered, then he had a one-to-one correspondence and the confusion could be resolved.<ref>{{harv|Lindberg|1976|p=74}}</ref> He later asserted (in book seven of the ''Optics'') that other rays would be refracted through the eye and perceived ''as if'' perpendicular.<ref>{{harv|Lindberg|1976|p=76}}</ref>\n\nHis arguments regarding perpendicular rays do not clearly explain why ''only'' perpendicular rays were perceived; why would the weaker oblique rays not be perceived more weakly?<ref>{{harvnb|Lindberg|1976|p=75}}</ref> His later argument that refracted rays would be perceived as if perpendicular does not seem persuasive.<ref>{{harvnb|Lindberg|1976|pages=76\u201378}}</ref> However, despite its weaknesses, no other theory of the time was so comprehensive, and it was enormously influential, particularly in Western Europe. Directly or indirectly, his ''De Aspectibus'' ([[Book of Optics]]) inspired much activity in optics between the 13th and 17th centuries.<ref name=\"{{harvnb|lindberg|1976|p=86}}.\">{{harvnb|Lindberg|1976|p=86}}.</ref> [[Kepler]]'s later theory of the [[retina]]l image (which resolved the problem of the correspondence of points on an object and points in the eye) built directly on the conceptual framework of Alhazen.<ref name=\"{{harvnb|lindberg|1976|p=86}}.\"/>\n\nAlhazen showed through experiment that light travels in straight lines, and carried out various experiments with [[lens (optics)|lenses]], [[mirror]]s, [[refraction]], and [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{harvnb|Al Deek|2004}}.</ref> His analyses of reflection and refraction considered the vertical and horizontal components of light rays separately.<ref>{{harvnb|Heeffer|2003}}.</ref>\n\nThe [[camera obscura]] was known to the [[History of Science and Technology in China|ancient Chinese]], and was described by the [[Han Chinese]] [[polymath]]ic [[genius]] [[Shen Kuo]] in his scientific book ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'', published in the year 1088 C.E. Aristotle had discussed the basic principle behind it in his ''Problems'', but Alhazen's work also contained the first clear description, outside of [[History of science and technology in China|China]], of [[camera obscura]] in the areas of the [[middle east]], [[Europe]], [[Africa]] and [[India]].<ref>{{harvnb|Kelley|Milone|Aveni|2005|p=83}}: \"The first clear description of the device appears in the ''Book of Optics'' of Alhazen.\"</ref> and early analysis<ref>{{harvtxt|Wade|Finger|2001}}: \"The principles of the camera obscura first began to be correctly analysed in the eleventh century, when they were outlined by Ibn al-Haytham.\"</ref> of the device.\n\nAlhazen used his [[camera obscura]] to observe the eclipse. In his essay \"On the Form of the Eclipse\" he writes that he observed the sickle-like shape of the sun at the time of an eclipse. The introduction to his essay reads as follows: The image of the sun at the time of the eclipse, unless it is total, demonstrates that when its light passes through a narrow, round hole and is cast on a plane opposite to the hole it takes on the form of a moonsickle. His findings solidified the importance in the history of the [[camera obscura]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of Photography|last=Eder|first=Josef|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1945|location=New York|pages=37}}</ref>\n\nAlhazen studied the process of sight, the structure of the eye, image formation in the eye, and the [[visual system]]. Ian P. Howard argued in a 1996 ''[[Perception (journal)|Perception]]'' article that Alhazen should be credited with many discoveries and theories previously attributed to Western Europeans writing centuries later. For example, he described what became in the 19th century [[Hering's law of equal innervation]]. He wrote a description of vertical [[horopter]]s 600 years before [[Aguilonius]] that is actually closer to the modern definition than Aguilonius's\u2014and his work on [[binocular disparity]] was repeated by Panum in 1858.<ref>{{harvnb|Howard|1996}}.</ref> Craig Aaen-Stockdale, while agreeing that Alhazen should be credited with many advances, has expressed some caution, especially when considering Alhazen in isolation from [[Ptolemy]], with whom Alhazen was extremely familiar. Alhazen corrected a significant error of Ptolemy regarding binocular vision, but otherwise his account is very similar; Ptolemy also attempted to explain what is now called Hering's law.<ref>{{harvnb|Aaen-Stockdale|2008}}</ref> In general, Alhazen built on and expanded the optics of Ptolemy.<ref>{{harvnb|Wade|1998|pages=240,316,334,367}}; {{harvnb|Howard|Wade|1996|pages=1195,1197,1200}}.</ref> In a more detailed account of Ibn al-Haytham's contribution to the study of binocular vision based on Lejeune<ref>{{harvnb|Lejeune|1958}}.</ref> and Sabra,<ref name=\"{{harvnb|sabra|1989}}.\">{{harvnb|Sabra|1989}}.</ref> Raynaud<ref>{{harvnb|Raynaud|2003}}.</ref> showed that the concepts of correspondence, homonymous and crossed diplopia were in place in Ibn al-Haytham's optics. But contrary to Howard, he explained why Ibn al-Haytham did not give the circular figure of the horopter and why, by reasoning experimentally, he was in fact closer to the discovery of Panum's fusional area than that of the Vieth-M\u00fcller circle. In this regard, Ibn al-Haytham's theory of binocular vision faced two main limits: the lack of recognition of the role of the retina, and obviously the lack of an experimental investigation of ocular tracts.\n\n[[File:Alhazen1652.png|left|thumb|upright|The structure of the [[human eye]] according to Ibn al-Haytham.

It comprises drawing lines from two points in the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] of a circle meeting at a point on the [[circumference]] and making equal angles with the [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] at that point. This is equivalent to finding the point on the edge of a circular [[billiard table]] at which a player must aim a cue ball at a given point to make it bounce off the table edge and hit another ball at a second given point. Thus, its main application in optics is to solve the problem, \"Given a light source and a spherical mirror, find the point on the mirror where the light will be reflected to the eye of an observer.\" This leads to an [[Quartic equation|equation of the fourth degree]].<ref>\n{{harvnb|O'Connor|Robertson|1999}}, {{harvnb|Weisstein|2008}}.</ref> This eventually led Alhazen to derive a formula for the sum of [[fourth power]]s, where previously only the formulas for the sums of squares and cubes had been stated. His method can be readily generalized to find the formula for the sum of any integral powers, although he did not himself do this (perhaps because he only needed the fourth power to calculate the volume of the paraboloid he was interested in). He used his result on sums of integral powers to perform what would now be called an [[Integral|integration]], where the formulas for the sums of integral squares and fourth powers allowed him to calculate the volume of a [[paraboloid]].<ref>{{harvnb|Katz|1995|pp=165\u20139 &amp; 173\u20134}}.</ref> Alhazen eventually solved the problem using [[conic section]]s and a geometric proof. His solution was extremely long and complicated and may not have been understood by mathematicians reading him in Latin translation. \nLater mathematicians used [[Descartes]]' analytical methods to analyse the problem.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1992}}.</ref> An algebraic solution to the problem was finally found in 1965 by Jack M.

He conducted experiments with [[projectile]]s and concluded that only the impact of [[perpendicular]] projectiles on surfaces was forceful enough to make them penetrate, whereas surfaces tended to deflect [[Oblique angle|oblique]] projectile strikes. For example, to explain refraction from a rare to a dense medium, he used the mechanical analogy of an iron ball thrown at a thin slate covering a wide hole in a metal sheet. A perpendicular throw breaks the slate and passes through, whereas an oblique one with equal force and from an equal distance does not.<ref>{{harvnb|Russell|1996|p=695}}.</ref> He also used this result to explain how intense, direct light hurts the eye, using a mechanical analogy: Alhazen associated 'strong' lights with perpendicular rays and 'weak' lights with oblique ones.

Alhazen argued against Ptolemy's refraction theory, and defined the problem in terms of perceived, rather than real, enlargement. He said that judging the distance of an object depends on there being an uninterrupted sequence of intervening bodies between the object and the observer. When the Moon is high in the sky there are no intervening objects, so the Moon appears close. The perceived size of an object of constant angular size varies with its perceived distance. Therefore, the Moon appears closer and smaller high in the sky, and further and larger on the horizon. Through works by [[Roger Bacon]], [[John Pecham]] and Witelo based on Alhazen's explanation, the Moon illusion gradually came to be accepted as a psychological phenomenon, with the refraction theory being rejected in the 17th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Hershenson|1989|pp=9\u201310}}.</ref> Although Alhazen is often credited with the perceived distance explanation, he was not the first author to offer it. [[Cleomedes]] ({{circa}} 2nd century) gave this account (in addition to refraction), and he credited it to [[Posidonius]] ({{circa}} 135\u201350 BC).<ref>{{harvnb|Ross|2000}}.</ref> Ptolemy may also have offered this explanation in his ''Optics'', but the text is obscure.<ref>{{harvnb|Ross|Ross|1976}}.</ref> Alhazen's writings were more widely available in the Middle Ages than those of these earlier authors, and that probably explains why Alhazen received the credit.\n\n== Other works on physics ==\n\n=== Optical treatises ===\n\nBesides the ''Book of Optics'', Alhazen wrote several other treatises on the same subject, including his ''Risala fi l-Daw''' (''Treatise on Light''). He investigated the properties of [[luminance]], the [[rainbow]], [[eclipse]]s, twilight, and [[moonlight]]. Experiments with mirrors and the refractive interfaces between air, water, and glass cubes, hemispheres, and quarter-spheres provided the foundation for his theories on [[catoptrics]].<ref name=\"{{harvnb|el-bizri|2006}}.\">{{harvnb|El-Bizri|2006}}.</ref>\n\n=== Celestial physics ===\nAlhazen discussed the [[physics]] of the celestial region in his ''Epitome of Astronomy'', arguing that Ptolemaic models must be understood in terms of physical objects rather than abstract hypotheses\u2014in other words that it should be possible to create physical models where (for example) none of the celestial bodies would collide with each other. The suggestion of mechanical models for the Earth centred [[Ptolemaic model]] \"greatly contributed to the eventual triumph of the Ptolemaic system among the Christians of the West\". Alhazen's determination to root astronomy in the realm of physical objects was important, however, because it meant astronomical hypotheses \"were accountable to the [[Physical law|laws of physics]]\", and could be criticised and improved upon in those terms.<ref>{{harvnb|Duhem|1969|p=28}}.</ref>\n\nHe also wrote ''Maqala fi daw al-qamar'' (''On the Light of the Moon'').\n\n=== Mechanics ===\n\nIn his work, Alhazen discussed theories on the [[Motion (physics)|motion]] of a body.<ref name=\"{{harvnb|el-bizri|2006}}.\"/> In his ''Treatise on Place'', Alhazen disagreed with [[Aristotle]]'s view that nature abhors a void, and he used [[geometry]] in an attempt to demonstrate that place (''al-makan'') is the imagined three-dimensional void between the inner surfaces of a containing body.<ref name=\"{{harvnb|el-bizri|2007}}.\">{{harvnb|El-Bizri|2007}}.</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Astronomy}}<!-- -Anchor for a wikilink in Celestial Spheres article.

It is stationary in its [the world's] middle, fixed in it and not moving in any direction nor moving with any of the varieties of motion, but always at rest.<ref>{{harvnb|Langermann|1990}}, chap. 2, sect. 22, p. 61</ref>}}\n\nThe book is a non-technical explanation of Ptolemy's [[Almagest]], which was eventually translated into [[Hebrew]] and [[Latin]] in the 13th and 14th centuries and subsequently had an influence on astronomers such as [[Georg von Peuerbach]]<ref name=\"{{harvnb|lorch|2008}}.\">{{harvnb|Lorch|2008}}.</ref> during the European [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]].<ref>{{harvnb|Langermann|1990|pp=34\u201341}}; {{harvnb|Gondhalekar|2001|p=21}}.</ref>\n\n=== ''Doubts Concerning Ptolemy'' ===\n\nIn his ''Al-Shuk\u016bk \u201bal\u0101 Batlamy\u016bs'', variously translated as ''Doubts Concerning Ptolemy'' or ''Aporias against Ptolemy'', published at some time between 1025 and 1028, Alhazen criticized [[Ptolemy]]'s ''Almagest'', ''Planetary Hypotheses'', and ''Optics'', pointing out various contradictions he found in these works, particularly in astronomy. Ptolemy's ''Almagest'' concerned mathematical theories regarding the motion of the planets, whereas the ''Hypotheses'' concerned what Ptolemy thought was the actual configuration of the planets. Ptolemy himself acknowledged that his theories and configurations did not always agree with each other, arguing that this was not a problem provided it did not result in noticeable error, but Alhazen was particularly scathing in his criticism of the inherent contradictions in Ptolemy's works.<ref name=\"{{harvnb|sabra|1998}}.\">{{harvnb|Sabra|1998}}.</ref> He considered that some of the mathematical devices Ptolemy introduced into astronomy, especially the [[equant]], failed to satisfy the physical requirement of uniform circular motion, and noted the absurdity of relating actual physical motions to imaginary mathematical points, lines and circles:<ref>{{harvnb|Langermann|1990|pp=8\u201310}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Ptolemy assumed an arrangement (''hay'a'') that cannot exist, and the fact that this arrangement produces in his imagination the motions that belong to the planets does not free him from the error he committed in his assumed arrangement, for the existing motions of the planets cannot be the result of an arrangement that is impossible to exist...  [F]or a man to imagine a circle in the heavens, and to imagine the planet moving in it does not bring about the planet's motion.<ref>{{harvnb|Sabra|1978b|p=121, n. 13}}</ref>}}\n\nHaving pointed out the problems, Alhazen appears to have intended to resolve the contradictions he pointed out in Ptolemy in a later work. Alhazen believed there was a \"true configuration\" of the planets that Ptolemy had failed to grasp. He intended to complete and repair Ptolemy's system, not to replace it completely.<ref name=\"{{harvnb|sabra|1998}}.\"/> In the ''Doubts Concerning Ptolemy'' Alhazen set out his views on the difficulty of attaining scientific knowledge and the need to question existing authorities and theories:\n\n{{quote|Truth is sought for itself [but] the truths, [he warns] are immersed in uncertainties [and the scientific authorities (such as Ptolemy, whom he greatly respected) are] not immune from error...<ref name=\"{{harvnb|sabra|1989}}.\"/>}}\n\nHe held that the criticism of existing theories\u2014which dominated this book\u2014holds a special place in the growth of scientific knowledge.\n\n=== ''Model of the Motions of Each of the Seven Planets'' ===\n\nAlhazen's ''The Model of the Motions of Each of the Seven Planets'' was written {{circa}} 1038. Only one damaged manuscript has been found, with only the introduction and the first section, on the theory of planetary motion, surviving. (There was also a second section on astronomical calculation, and a third section, on astronomical instruments.) Following on from his ''Doubts on Ptolemy'', Alhazen described a new, geometry-based planetary model, describing the motions of the planets in terms of spherical geometry, infinitesimal geometry and trigonometry. He kept a geocentric universe and assumed that celestial motions are uniformly circular, which required the inclusion of [[epicycles]] to explain observed motion, but he managed to eliminate Ptolemy's [[equant]]. In general, his model didn't try to provide a causal explanation of the motions, but concentrated on providing a complete, geometric description that could explain observed motions without the contradictions inherent in Ptolemy's model.<ref>{{harvnb|Rashed|2007}}.</ref>\n\n=== Other astronomical works ===\n\nAlhazen wrote a total of twenty-five astronomical works, some concerning technical issues such as ''Exact Determination of the Meridian'', a second group concerning accurate astronomical observation, a third group concerning various astronomical problems and questions such as the location of the [[Milky Way]]; Alhazen argued for a distant location, based on the fact that it does not move in relation to the fixed stars.<ref>{{harvnb|Mohamed|2000|pp=49\u201350}}</ref> The fourth group consists of ten works on astronomical theory, including the ''Doubts'' and ''Model of the Motions'' discussed above.<ref>{{harvnb|Rashed|2007|pp=8\u20139}}.</ref>\n\n== Mathematical works ==\n[[File:AlhazenSummation.png|thumb|150px|Alhazen's geometrically proven summation formula]]\nIn [[Islamic mathematics|mathematics]], Alhazen built on the mathematical works of [[Euclid]] and [[Thabit ibn Qurra]] and worked on \"the beginnings of the link between [[algebra]] and [[geometry]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Faruqi|2006|pp=395\u20136}}:\n{{quote|In seventeenth century Europe the problems formulated by Ibn al-Haytham (965\u20131041) became known as 'Alhazen's problem'. ...

Al-Haytham also worked on analytical geometry and the beginnings of the link between algebra and geometry.

He used this to find the volume of a [[paraboloid]]. He could find the integral formula for any polynomial without having developed a general formula.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2691411 |author=Katz, Victor J. |title=Ideas of Calculus in Islam and India |jstor=2691411 |journal=Mathematics Magazine |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=163\u2013174 |year=1995 }} [165\u20139, 173\u20134]</ref>\n\n== Other works ==\n\n=== ''Influence of Melodies on the Souls of Animals'' ===\n\nAlhazen also wrote a ''Treatise on the Influence of Melodies on the Souls of Animals'', although no copies have survived.

He carried out a detailed scientific study of the annual [[inundation]] of the Nile River, and he drew plans for building a [[dam]], at the site of the modern-day [[Aswan Dam]].

He was voiced by [[Alfred Molina]] in the episode.\n\nOver forty years previously, [[Jacob Bronowski]] presented Alhazen's work in a similar television documentary (and the corresponding book), ''[[The Ascent of Man]]''. In episode 5 (''The Music of the Spheres''), Bronowski remarked that in his view, Alhazen was \"the one really original scientific mind that Arab culture produced\", whose theory of optics was not improved on till the time of Newton and Leibniz.\n\nH. J. J. Winter, a British historian of science, summing up the importance of Ibn al-Haytham in the history of [[physics]] wrote:\n<blockquote>After the death of Archimedes no really great physicist appeared until Ibn al-Haytham. If, therefore, we confine our interest only to the history of physics, there is a long period of over twelve hundred years during which the Golden Age of Greece gave way to the era of Muslim Scholasticism, and the experimental spirit of the noblest physicist of Antiquity lived again in the Arab Scholar from Basra.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Winter |first1=H.

Most of his works are now lost, but more than 50 of them have survived to some extent. Nearly half of his surviving works are on mathematics, 23 of them are on astronomy, and 14 of them are on optics, with a few on other subjects.<ref>{{harvnb|Rashed|2002a|p=773}}.</ref> Not all his

Two potential overall strategies outlined were: mitigation, in which the aim is to reduce the health impact of the epidemic but not to stop transmission completely; and suppression, where the aim is to reduce transmission rates to a point where case numbers fall. Until this point government actions had been based on a strategy of mitigation, but the modelling predicted that while this would reduce deaths by approximately 2/3, it would still lead to approximately 250,000 deaths from the disease and the health systems becoming overwhelmed.<ref name=\"Imperial16March2020\" /> On the same day as the report was released, the Prime Minister announced

Two potential overall strategies outlined were: mitigation, in which the aim is to reduce the health impact of the epidemic but not to stop transmission completely; and suppression, where the aim is to reduce transmission rates to a point where case numbers fall. Until this point government actions had been based on a strategy of mitigation, but the modelling predicted that while this would reduce deaths by approximately 2/3, it would still lead to approximately 250,000 deaths from the disease and the health systems becoming overwhelmed.<ref name=\"Imperial16March2020\" /> On the same day as the report was released, the Prime Minister announced in a press conference significant changes to the government advice, extending self isolation to whole households, advising social distancing particularly for vulnerable groups, and indicating that

Washington, DC : Center of Military History, 1996. Page 202]).\n* West German military historian Burkhart M\u00fcller-Hillebrand (''Das Heer 1933\u20131945'' Vol 3. Page 262) estimated 265,000 dead from all causes and 1,012,000 missing and prisoners of war on all German battlefronts from Jan 1, 1945 \u2013 April 30, 1945. No breakdown of these figures between the various battlefronts was provided.\n* US Army historian Charles B. MacDonald (''The European Theater of Operations: The Last Offensive'', Center of Military History, United States Army, Washington D.C., 1993, page 478) holds that ''\"exclusive of prisoners of war, all German casualties in the west from D-day to V\u2013E Day probably equaled or slightly exceeded Allied losses\"''. In the related footnote he writes the following: ''\"The only specific figures available are from OB WEST for the period 2 June 1941\u201310 April 1945 as follows: Dead, 80,819; wounded, 265,526; missing, 490,624; total, 836,969. (Of the total, 4,548 casualties were incurred prior to D-day.) See Rpts, Der Heeresarzt im Oberkommando des Heeres Gen St d H/Gen Qu, Az.: 1335 c/d (IIb) Nr.: H.A./263/45 g. Kdos. of 14 Apr 45 and 1335 c/d (Ilb) (no date, but before 1945). The former is in OCMH X 313, a photostat of a document contained in German armament folder H 17/207; the latter in folder 0KW/1561 (OKW Wehrmacht Verluste). These figures are for the field army only, and do not include the Luftwaffe and Waffen-SS. Since the Germans seldom remained in control of the battlefield in a position to verify the status of those missing, a considerable percentage of the missing probably were killed. Time lag in reporting probably precludes these figures' reflecting the heavy losses during the Allied drive to the Rhine in March, and the cut-off date precludes inclusion of the losses in the Ruhr Pocket and in other stages of the fight in central Germany.\"''\n* German military historian R\u00fcdiger Overmans (''Deutsche milit\u00e4rische Verluste im Zweiten Weltkrieg'', Oldenbourg 2000, pp.265\u2013272) maintains, based on extrapolations from a statistical sample of the German military personnel records.(see [[German casualties in World War II]]), that the German armed forces suffered 1,230,045 deaths in the \"Final Battles\" on the Eastern and Western fronts from January to May 1945. This figure is broken down as follows (p. 272): 401,660 killed, 131,066 dead from other causes, 697,319 missing and presumed dead. According to Overmans the figures are calculated at \"todeszeitpunkt\" the point of death, which means the losses occurred between January to May 1945. The number of POW deaths in Western captivity calculated by Overmans, based on the actual reported cases is 76,000 (p. 286). Between 1962 and 1974 by a German government commission, the Maschke Commission put the figure at 31,300 in western captivity.(p. 286) Overmans maintains (pp. 275, 279) that all 1,230,045 deaths occurred during the period from January to May 1945. He states that there is not sufficient data to give an exact breakout of the 1.2 million dead in the final battles (p.174). He did however make a rough estimate of the allocation for total war losses of 5.3 million; 4 million (75%) on the Eastern front, 1 million (20%) in the West and 500,000 (10%) in other theaters. Up until Dec. 1944 losses in the West were 340,000, this indicates losses could be 400,000 to 600,000 deaths in the Western theater from January to May 1945 (p.265). Overmans does not consider the high losses in early 1945 surprising in view of the bitter fighting, he notes that there were many deaths in the Ruhr pocket (p.240) According to Overmans the total dead including POW deaths, in all theaters from Jan\u2013May 1945 was 1,407,000 (January-452,000; February-295,000; March-284,000; April-282,000; May-94,000) No breakout by theater for these losses is provided.(p.239)</ref><br>200,000 captured<br><small>(January\u2013March)</small><br>4,400,000 surrendered<br><small>(April\u2013June)</small><ref>R\u00fcdiger Overmans, Soldaten hinter Stacheldraht.

In preparation for the Allied invasion of Germany, a series of offensive operations were designed to seize and capture the east and west bank of the [[Rhine River]]: [[Operation Veritable]] and [[Operation Grenade]] in February 1945, and [[Operation Lumberjack]] and [[Operation Undertone]] in March 1945. The Allied invasion of Germany started with the Western Allies crossing the Rhine on 22 March 1945 before fanning out and overrunning all of [[western Germany]] from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] in the north to the [[Principal passes of the Alps|Alpine passes]] in the south, where they linked up with troops of the [[United States Army North|U.S. Fifth Army]] in Italy.<ref name=Alps>Fifth Army History \u2022 Race to the Alps, Chapter VI : Conclusion [http://www.milhist.net/mto/racealps.html] \"On 3 May the 85th and 88th [Infantry] Divisions sent task forces north over ice and snow 3 feet deep to seal the Austrian frontier and to gain contact with the American Seventh Army, driving southward from Germany.

This is known as the \"Central Europe campaign\" in [[United States]] military histories.\n\nBy early 1945, events favored the Allied forces in Europe. On the [[Western Front (World War II)#Winter counter-offensives|Western Front]] the Allies had been fighting in Germany with campaigns against the [[Siegfried Line]] since the [[Battle of Aachen]] and the [[Battle of Hurtgen Forest]] in late 1944 and by January 1945 had pushed the Germans back to their starting points during the [[Battle of the Bulge]]. The failure of this offensive exhausted Germany's strategic reserve, leaving it ill-prepared to resist the final Allied campaigns in Europe. Additional losses in the [[Rhineland]] further weakened the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]], leaving shattered remnants of units to defend the east bank of the Rhine. On 7 March, the Allies [[Battle of Remagen|seized the last remaining intact]] [[Ludendorff Bridge|bridge]] across the Rhine at [[Remagen]], and had established a large [[bridgehead]] on the river's east bank. During Operation Lumberjack, [[Operation Plunder]] and Operation Undertone in March 1945, German casualties during February\u2013March 1945 are estimated at 400,000 men, including 280,000 men captured as [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]].{{sfn|Zaloga|Dennis|2006|p=88}}\n\nOn the [[Eastern Front (World War II)#Autumn 1944|Eastern Front]], the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] (including the [[Polish Armed Forces in the East]] under Soviet command) simultaneously with the Western Allies, had [[Vistula-Oder Offensive|taken most of Poland]] and began their offensive into Eastern Germany in February 1945, and by March were within striking distance of [[Berlin]]. The initial advance into Romania, the [[First Jassy\u2013Kishinev Offensive]] in April and May 1944 was a failure; the [[Jassy\u2013Kishinev Offensive|second Offensive]] in August succeeded. The Red Army also pushed deep into Hungary (the [[Budapest Offensive]]) and eastern [[Czechoslovakia]] and temporarily halted at what is now the modern German border on the [[Oder\u2013Neisse line]]. These rapid advances on the Eastern Front destroyed additional veteran German combat units and severely limited German F\u00fchrer [[Adolf Hitler]]'s ability to reinforce his Rhine defenses. With the Western Allies making final preparations for their powerful offensive into the German heartland, victory was imminent.\n\n== Order of battle ==\n\n=== Allied forces ===\nAt the very beginning of 1945, the [[Supreme Allied Commander|Supreme Commander]] of the Allied Expeditionary Force on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]], [[General (United States)|General]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], had 73 divisions under his command in North-western Europe, of which 49 were infantry divisions, 20 armored divisions and four airborne divisions. Forty-nine of these divisions were [[United States Army|American]], 12 [[British Army|British]], eight [[French Army|French]], three [[Canadian Army|Canadian]] and one [[Polish Armed Forces in the West|Polish]]. Another seven American divisions arrived during February,{{sfn|Hastings|2005|p=465}} along with the [[5th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|British 5th Infantry Division]] and [[I Canadian Corps]], both of which had arrived from the fighting on the [[Italian campaign (World War II)|Italian front]]. As the invasion of Germany commenced, Eisenhower had a total of 90 full-strength divisions under his command, with the number of armored divisions now reaching 25. The Allied front along the Rhine stretched {{convert|450|mi|km}} from the river's mouth at the North Sea in the Netherlands to the Swiss border in the south.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=3}}\n\nThe Allied forces along this line were organized into three army groups. In the north, from the North Sea to a point about {{convert|10|mi|km|}} north of Cologne, was the [[21st Army Group]] commanded by [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[Bernard Montgomery]]. Within 21st Army Group the [[First Canadian Army|Canadian 1st Army]] (under [[Harry Crerar]]) held the left flank of the Allied line, with the [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|British 2nd Army]] ([[Miles Dempsey|Miles C. Dempsey]]) in the center and the [[Ninth United States Army|U.S. 9th Army]] ([[William Hood Simpson]]) to the south. Holding the middle of the Allied line from the 9th Army's right flank to a point about {{convert|15|mi|km}} south of [[Mainz]] was the [[Twelfth United States Army Group|12th Army Group]] under the command of [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Omar Bradley]]. Bradley had two American armies, the [[First United States Army|U.S. 1st Army]] ([[Courtney Hodges]]) on the left (north) and the [[United States Army Central|U.S. 3rd Army]] ([[George S. Patton]]) on the right (south). Completing the Allied line to the Swiss border was the [[Sixth United States Army Group|6th Army Group]] commanded by Lieutenant General [[Jacob L. Devers]], with the [[Seventh United States Army|U.S. 7th Army]] ([[Alexander Patch]]) in the north and the [[First Army (France)|French 1st Army]] ([[Jean de Lattre de Tassigny]]) on the Allied right, and southernmost, flank.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|pp=3\u20136}}\n\nAs these three army groups cleared out the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' west of the Rhine, Eisenhower began to rethink his plans for the final drive across the Rhine and into the heart of Germany. Originally, Eisenhower had planned to draw all his forces up to the west bank of the Rhine, using the river as a natural barrier to help cover the inactive sections of his line. The main thrust beyond the river was to be made in the north by Montgomery's 21 Army Group, elements of which were to proceed east to a juncture with the U.S. 1st Army as it made a secondary advance northeast from below the [[Ruhr]] River. If successful, this pincer movement would envelop the industrial Ruhr area, neutralizing the largest concentration of German industrial capacity left.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=6}}\n\n=== German forces ===\nFacing the Allies was [[OB West|''Oberbefehlshaber West'']] (\"Army Command West\") commanded by [[Generalfeldmarschall]] [[Albert Kesselring]], who had taken over from Generalfeldmarschall [[Gerd von Rundstedt]] on 10 March. Although Kesselring brought an outstanding track record as a defensive strategist with him from the Italian campaign, he did not have the resources to make a coherent defense. During the fighting west of the Rhine up to March 1945, the German Army on the Western Front had been reduced to a strength of only 26 divisions, organized into three army groups (''[[Army Group H|H]]'', ''[[Army Group B|B]]'' and ''[[Army Group G|G]]''). Little or no reinforcement was forthcoming as the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]] continued to concentrate most forces against the Soviets; it was estimated that the Germans had 214 divisions on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] in April.{{sfn|Keegan|1989|p=182}}\n\nOn 21 March, Army Group H headquarters became ''Oberbefehlshaber Nordwest'' (\"Army Command Northwest\") commanded by [[Ernst Busch (military)|Ernst Busch]] leaving the former Army Group H commander\u2014[[Johannes Blaskowitz]]\u2014to lead \"Army Command Netherlands\" ([[25th Army (Wehrmacht)|25th Army]]) cut off in the Netherlands. Busch\u2014whose main unit was the [[1st Parachute Army (Wehrmacht)|German 1st Parachute Army]] \u2014was to form the right wing of the German defenses. In the center of the front, defending the Ruhr, Kesselring had Field Marshal [[Walther Model]] commanding Army Group B ([[15th Army (Wehrmacht)|15th Army]] and [[5th Panzer Army]]) and in the south [[Paul Hausser]]'s Army Group G ([[7th Army (Wehrmacht)|7th Army]], [[1st Army (Wehrmacht)|1st Army]] and [[19th Army (Wehrmacht)|19th Army]]).{{sfn|Keegan|1989|p=182}}<ref>{{cite web|first=Marcus|last=Wendel|url=http://www.axishistory.com/index.php?id=30|title= Heer|work=Axis History Factbook}}</ref>\n\n== Eisenhower's plans ==\nAfter capturing the Ruhr, Eisenhower planned to have the 21st Army Group continue its drive east across the [[North German Plain|plains of northern Germany]] to Berlin. The 12th and 6th Army Groups were to mount a subsidiary offensive to keep the Germans off balance and diminish their ability to stop the northern thrust. This secondary drive would also give Eisenhower a degree of flexibility in case the northern attack ran into difficulties.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=6}}\n\nFor several reasons, Eisenhower began to readjust these plans toward the end of March. First, his headquarters received reports that Soviet forces held a bridgehead over the [[Oder|Oder River]], {{convert|30|mi|km}} from Berlin. Since the Allied armies on the Rhine were more than {{convert|300|mi|km}} from Berlin, with the [[Elbe|Elbe River]], {{convert|200|mi|km}} ahead, still to be crossed it seemed clear that the Soviets would capture Berlin long before the Western Allies could reach it. Eisenhower thus turned his attention to other objectives, most notably a rapid meet-up with the Soviets to cut the German Army in two and prevent any possibility of a unified defense. Once this was accomplished the remaining German forces could be [[defeat in detail|defeated in detail]].{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=6}}\n\nIn addition, there was the matter of the Ruhr. Although the Ruhr area still contained a significant number of Axis troops and enough industry to retain its importance as a major objective, Allied intelligence reported that much of the region's armament industry was moving southeast, deeper into Germany. This increased the importance of the southern offensives across the Rhine.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=6}}\n\nAlso focusing Eisenhower's attention on the southern drive was concern over the \"[[National redoubt#Germany|National redoubt]].\" According to rumor, Hitler's most fanatically loyal troops were preparing to make a lengthy, last-ditch stand in the natural fortresses formed by the rugged alpine mountains of southern Germany and western Austria. If they held out for a year or more, dissension between the Soviet Union and the Western Allies might give them political leverage for some kind of favorable peace settlement. In reality, by the time of the Allied Rhine crossings the ''Wehrmacht'' had suffered such severe defeats on both the Eastern and Western Fronts that it could barely manage to mount effective delaying actions, much less muster enough troops to establish a well-organized alpine resistance force. Still, Allied intelligence could not entirely discount the possibility that remnants of the German forces would attempt a suicidal last stand in the Alps. Denying this opportunity became another argument for rethinking the role of the southern drive through Germany.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=7}}\n\nPerhaps the most compelling reason for increasing the emphasis on this southern drive had more to do with the actions of Americans than those of Germans. While Montgomery was carefully and cautiously planning for the main thrust in the north, complete with massive artillery preparation and an airborne assault, American forces in the south were displaying the kind of basic aggressiveness that Eisenhower wanted to see. On 7 March, Hodges's U.S. 1st Army [[Battle of Remagen|captured]] the last intact [[Ludendorff Bridge|bridge over the Rhine]] at [[Remagen]] and steadily expanded the [[bridgehead]].{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=7}}\n\nTo the south in the [[Saarpfalz-Kreis|Saar-Palatinate]] region, Patton's U.S. 3rd Army had dealt a devastating blow to the German 7th Army and, in conjunction with the U.S. 7th Army, had nearly destroyed the German 1st Army. In five days of battle, from 18\u201322 March, Patton's forces captured over 68,000 Germans. These bold actions eliminated the last German positions west of the Rhine. Although Montgomery's drive was still planned as the main effort, Eisenhower believed that the momentum of the American forces to the south should not be squandered by having them merely hold the line at the Rhine or make only limited diversionary attacks beyond it. By the end of March, the Supreme Commander thus leaned toward a decision to place more responsibility on his southern forces. The events of the first few days of the final campaign would be enough to convince him that this was the proper course of action.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=7}}\n\n== Occupation process ==\nWhen Allied soldiers arrived in a town, its leaders and remaining residents typically used white flags, bedsheets, and tablecloths to signal surrender. The officer in charge of the unit capturing the area, typically a company or battalion, accepted responsibility over the town. Soldiers posted copies of General Eisenhower's ''[[:de:File:Proklamation Nr. 1 - Zweisprachige Bekanntmachung des Obersten Befehlshabers der alliierten Streitkr\u00e4fte Dwight D. Eisenhower (deutschsprachiger Teil).jpg|Proclamation No. 1]]'', which began with \"We come as a victorious army, not as oppressors.\" The proclamation demanded compliance with all orders by the commanding officer, instituted a strict curfew and limited travel, and confiscated all communications equipment and weapons. After a day or two, specialized [[Office of Military Government, United States]] (OMGUS) units took over. Soldiers requisitioned housing and office space as needed from residents. At first this was done informally with occupants evicted immediately and taking with them few personal possessions, but the process became standardized, with three hours' notice and OMGUS personnel providing receipts for buildings' contents. The displaced residents nonetheless had to find housing on their own.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=38\u201339}}\n\n== Operations ==\nOn 19 March, Eisenhower told Bradley to prepare the 1st Army for a breakout from the Remagen bridgehead any time after 22 March. The same day, in response to the 3rd Army's robust showing in the Saar-Palatinate region, and to have another strong force on the Rhine's east bank guarding the 1st Army's flank, Bradley gave Patton the go-ahead for an assault crossing of the Rhine as soon as possible.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=8}}\n\nThese were exactly the orders Patton had hoped for, he felt that if a sufficiently strong force could be thrown across the river and significant gains made, then Eisenhower might transfer responsibility for the main drive through Germany from Montgomery's 21st Army Group to Bradley's 12th. Patton also appreciated the opportunity he now had to beat Montgomery across the river and win for the 3rd Army the coveted distinction of making the first assault crossing of the Rhine in modern history. To accomplish this, he had to move quickly.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=8}}\n\nOn 21 March, Patton ordered his [[XII Corps (United States)|XII Corps]] to prepare for an assault over the Rhine on the following night, one day before Montgomery's scheduled crossing. While this was short notice, it did not catch the XII Corps completely unaware. As soon as Patton had received the orders on the 19th to make a crossing, he had begun sending assault boats, bridging equipment and other supplies forward from depots in [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]] where they had been stockpiled since autumn in the expectation of just such an opportunity. Seeing this equipment moving up, his frontline soldiers did not need any orders from higher headquarters to tell them what it meant.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=9}}\n\nThe location of the river-crossing assault was critical. Patton knew that the most obvious place to jump the river was at Mainz or just downstream, north of the city. The choice was obvious because the [[Main River]], flowing northward {{convert|30|mi|km}} east of and parallel to the Rhine, turns west and empties into the Rhine at Mainz and an advance south of the city would involve crossing two rivers rather than one. However, Patton also realized that the Germans were aware of this difficulty and would expect his attack north of Mainz. Thus, he decided to feint at Mainz while making his real effort at [[Nierstein-Oppenheim|Nierstein and Oppenheim]], {{convert|9|-|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of the city. Following this primary assault, which XII Corps would undertake, [[VIII Corps (United States)|VIII Corps]] would execute supporting crossings at [[Boppard]] and [[Sankt Goar|St. Goar]], {{convert|25|-|30|mi|km}} northwest of Mainz.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=9}}\n\nThe terrain in the vicinity of Nierstein and Oppenheim was conducive to artillery support, with high ground on the west bank overlooking relatively flat land to the east. However, the same flat east bank meant that the bridgehead would have to be rapidly and powerfully reinforced and expanded beyond the river since there was no high ground for a bridgehead defense. The importance of quickly obtaining a deep bridgehead was increased by the fact that the first access to a decent road network was over {{convert|6|mi|km}} inland at the town of Gro\u00df- Gerau.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=9}}\n\n=== U.S. 12th Army Group crosses the Rhine (22 March) ===\n[[File:Crossing of the Rhine.jpg|thumb|The crossing of the Rhine between 22 and 28 March 1945]]\nOn 22 March, with a bright moon lighting the late-night sky, elements of U.S. XII Corps\u2032 [[5th Infantry Division (United States)|5th Infantry Division]] began the 3rd Army's Rhine crossing. At Nierstein assault troops did not meet any resistance. As the first boats reached the east bank, seven startled Germans surrendered and then paddled themselves unescorted to the west bank to be placed in custody. Upstream at Oppenheim, however, the effort did not proceed so casually. The first wave of boats was halfway across when the Germans began pouring machine-gun fire into their midst. An intense exchange of fire lasted for about thirty minutes as assault boats kept pushing across the river and those men who had already made it across mounted attacks against the scattered defensive strongpoints. Finally the Germans surrendered, and by midnight units moved out laterally to consolidate the crossing sites and to attack the first villages beyond the river. German resistance everywhere was sporadic, and the hastily mounted counterattacks invariably burned out quickly, causing few casualties. The Germans lacked both the manpower and the heavy equipment to make a more determined defense.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|pp=9\u201310}}\n\nBy midafternoon on 23 March, all three regiments of the 5th Infantry Division were in the bridgehead, and an attached regiment from the [[90th Infantry Division (United States)|90th Infantry Division]] was crossing. Tanks and tank destroyers had been ferried across all morning, and by evening a [[Treadway bridge]] was open to traffic. By midnight, infantry units had pushed the boundary of the bridgehead more than {{convert|5|mi|km}} inland, ensuring the unqualified success of the first modern assault crossing of the Rhine.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=10}}\n\nTwo more 3rd Army crossings\u2014both by VIII Corps\u2014quickly followed. In the early morning hours of 25 March, elements of the [[87th Infantry Division (United States)|87th Infantry Division]] crossed the Rhine to the north at Boppard, and then some 24 hours later elements of the [[89th Infantry Division (United States)|89th Infantry Division]] crossed {{convert|8|mi|km}} south of Boppard at St. Goar. Although the defense of these sites was somewhat more determined than that XII Corps had faced, the difficulties of the Boppard and St. Goar crossings were compounded more by terrain than by German resistance. VIII Corps crossing sites were located along the [[Rhine Gorge]], where the river had carved a deep chasm between two mountain ranges, creating precipitous canyon walls over {{convert|300|ft|m}} high on both sides. In addition, the river flowed quickly and with unpredictable currents along this part of its course. Still, despite the terrain and German machine-gun and {{convert|20|mm|in|2}} [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] [[Autocannon|cannon]] fire, VIII Corps troops managed to gain control of the east bank's heights, and by dark on 26 March, with German resistance crumbling all along the Rhine, they were preparing to continue the drive the next morning.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=11}}\n\n=== U.S. 6th Army Group crosses the Rhine (26 March) ===\nAdding to the Germans\u2032 woes, the 6th Army Group made an assault across the Rhine on 26 March. At [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], about {{convert|25|mi|km}} south of Mainz, the 7th Army's [[XV Corps (United States)|XV Corps]] established a bridgehead, which it consolidated with the southern shoulder of the 3rd Army's bridgehead early the next day. After overcoming stiff initial resistance, XV Corps also advanced beyond the Rhine, opposed primarily by small German strongpoints sited in roadside villages.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=11}}\n\n=== British 21st Army Group plans ''Operation Plunder'' ===\nOn the night of 23/24 March, after the XII Corps\u2032 assault of the Rhine, Bradley had announced his success. The 12th Army Group commander said that American troops could cross the Rhine anywhere, without aerial bombardment or airborne troops, a direct jab at Montgomery whose troops were at that very moment preparing to launch their own Rhine assault following an intense and elaborate aerial and artillery preparation and with the assistance of two airborne divisions, the American [[17th Airborne Division (United States)|17th]] and the British [[6th Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|6th]].{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=11}}\n\nMontgomery was exhibiting his now legendary meticulous and circumspect approach to such enterprises, a lesson he had learned early in the [[North African campaign]]. Thus, as his forces had approached the east bank of the river, Montgomery proceeded with one of the most intensive buildups of material and manpower of the war. His detailed plans, code-named [[Operation Plunder]], were comparable to the Normandy invasion in terms of numbers of men and extent of equipment, supplies, and ammunition to be used. The 21st Army Group had 30 full-strength divisions, 11 each in the British 2nd and U.S. 9th Armies and eight in the Canadian 1st Army, providing Montgomery with more than 1,250,000 men.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=11}}\n\nPlunder called for the 2nd Army to cross at three locations along the 21st Army Group front\u2014at [[Rees, Germany|Rees]], [[Xanten]] and [[Rheinberg]]. The crossings would be preceded by several weeks of aerial bombing and a final massive artillery preparation. A heavy bombing campaign by [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] and [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] forces, known as the \"Interdiction of Northwest Germany\", designed primarily to destroy the [[Line of communication|lines of communication]] and supply connecting the Ruhr to the rest of Germany had been underway since February.<ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/AAF/III/AAF-III-21.html Chapter 21: From the Rhine to the Elbe]</ref> The intention was to create a line from Bremen south to Neuwied. The main targets were rail yards, bridges and communication centers, with a secondary focus on fuel processing and storage facilities and other important industrial sites. During the three days leading up to Montgomery's attack, targets in front of the 21st Army Group zone and in the Ruhr area to the southeast were pummeled by about 11,000 sorties, effectively sealing off the Ruhr while easing the burden on Montgomery's assault forces.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=12}}\n\nMontgomery had originally planned to attach one corps of the U.S. 9th Army to the British 2nd Army, which would use only two of the corps\u2032 divisions for the initial assault. The rest of the 9th Army would remain in reserve until the bridgehead was ready for exploitation. The 9th Army's commander, Lieutenant General William Hood Simpson and the 2nd Army's Lieutenant-General Miles C. Dempsey took exception to this approach. Both believed that the plan squandered the great strength in men and equipment that the 9th Army had assembled and ignored the many logistical problems of placing the 9th Army's crossing sites within the 2nd Army's zone.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=12}}\n\nMontgomery responded to these concerns by making a few small adjustments to the plan. Although he declined to increase the size of the American crossing force beyond two divisions, he agreed to keep it under 9th Army rather than 2nd Army control. To increase Simpson's ability to bring his army's strength to bear for exploitation, Montgomery also agreed to turn the bridges at [[Wesel]], just north of the inter-army boundary, over to the 9th Army once the bridgehead had been secured.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=12}}\n\nIn the southernmost sector of the 21st Army Group's attack, the 9th Army's assault divisions were to cross the Rhine along an {{convert|11|mi|km}} section of the front, south of Wesel and the [[Lippe River]]. This force would block any German counterattack from the Ruhr. Because of the poor road network on the east bank of this part of the Rhine, a second 9th Army corps was to cross over the promised Wesel bridges through the British zone north of the Lippe River, which had an abundance of good roads. After driving east nearly {{convert|100|mi|km}}, this corps was to meet elements of the 1st Army near [[Paderborn]], completing the encirclement of the Ruhr.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=12}}\n\nAnother important aspect of Montgomery's plan was [[Operation Varsity]], in which two divisions of Major General [[Matthew Ridgway]]'s [[XVIII Airborne Corps]] were to make an airborne assault over the Rhine. In a departure from standard airborne doctrine, which called for a jump deep behind enemy lines several hours prior to an amphibious assault, Varsity's drop zones were close behind the German front, within Allied artillery range. Additionally, to avoid being caught in the artillery preparation, the paratroopers would jump only after the amphibious troops had reached the Rhine's east bank. The wisdom of putting lightly-armed paratroopers so close to the main battlefield was debated, and the plan for amphibious forces to cross the Rhine prior to the parachute drop raised questions as to the utility of making an airborne assault at all. However, Montgomery believed that the paratroopers would quickly link up with the advancing river assault forces, placing the strongest force within the bridgehead as rapidly as possible. Once the bridgehead was secured the British 6th Airborne Division would be transferred to 2nd Army control, while the U.S. 17th Airborne Division would revert to 9th Army control.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=13}}\n\n=== Montgomery launches ''Operation Plunder'' (23 March) ===\n{{Main|Operation Plunder}}\nPlunder began on the evening of 23 March with the assault elements of the British 2nd Army massed against three main crossing sites: Rees in the north, Xanten in the center, and Wesel in the south. The two 9th Army divisions tasked for the assault concentrated in the Rheinberg area south of Wesel. At the northern crossing site, elements of [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|British XXX Corps]] began the assault (Operation Turnscrew) about 21:00, attempting to distract the Germans from the main crossings at Xanten in the center and Rheinberg to the south. The initial assault waves crossed the river quickly, meeting only light opposition. Meanwhile, Operation Widgeon began {{convert|2|mi|km}} north of Wesel as the 2nd Army's [[1st Special Service Brigade|1st Commando Brigade]] slipped across the river and waited within {{convert|1|mi}} of the city while it was demolished by one thousand tons of bombs delivered by [[RAF Bomber Command]]. Entering in the night, the commandos secured the city late on the morning of 24 March, although scattered resistance continued until dawn on the 25th. The 2nd Army's [[XII Corps (United Kingdom)|XII Corps]] and the 9th Army's [[XVI Corps (United States)|XVI Corps]] began the main effort about 02:00 on 24 March, following a massive artillery and air bombardment.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=13}}\n\nFor the American crossing, Simpson had chosen the veteran [[30th Infantry Division (United States)|30th]] and [[79th Infantry Division (United States)|79th Infantry Divisions]] of the XVI Corps. The 30th was to cross between Wesel and Rheinberg while the 79th assaulted south of Rheinberg. In reserve were the XVI Corps\u2032 [[8th Armored Division (United States)|8th Armored Division]], and [[35th Infantry Division (United States)|35th]] and [[75th Infantry Division (United States)|75th Infantry Divisions]], as well as the 9th Army's [[XIII Corps (United States)|XIII]] and [[XIX Corps (United States)|XIX Corps]], each with three divisions. Simpson planned to commit the XIX Corps as soon as possible after the bridgehead had been secured, using the XIII Corps to hold the Rhine south of the crossing sites.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=13}}\n\nAfter an hour of extremely intense artillery preparation, which Eisenhower himself viewed from the front, the 30th Infantry Division began its assault. The artillery fire had been so effective and so perfectly timed that the assault battalions merely motored their storm boats across the river and claimed the east bank against almost no resistance. As subsequent waves of troops crossed, units fanned out to take the first villages beyond the river to only the weakest of opposition. An hour later, at 03:00, the 79th Infantry Division began its crossing upriver, achieving much the same results. As heavier equipment was ferried across the Rhine, both divisions began pushing east, penetrating {{convert|3|-|6|mi|km}} into the German defensive line that day.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=16}}\n\n[[File:C-47 transport planes release hundreds of paratroops.jpg|thumb|left|[[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Douglas C-47]] transport aircraft drop hundreds of paratroopers on 24 March as part of [[Operation Varsity]].]]\n\nTo the north, the British crossings had also gone well, with the ground and airborne troops linking up by nightfall. By then, the paratroopers had taken all their first day's objectives in addition to 3,500 prisoners.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=16}}\n\nTo the south, the discovery of a defensive gap in front of the 30th Infantry Division fostered the hope that a full-scale breakout would be possible on 25 March. When limited objective attacks provoked little response on the morning of the 25th, the division commander Major General [[Leland Hobbs]] formed two mobile task forces to make deeper thrusts with an eye toward punching through the defense altogether and breaking deep into the German rear. However, Hobbs had not fully taken into account the nearly nonexistent road network in front of the XVI Corps bridgehead. Faced with trying to make rapid advances through dense forest on rutted dirt roads and muddy trails, which could be strongly defended by a few determined soldiers and well placed roadblocks, the task forces advanced only about {{convert|2|mi|km}} on the 25th. The next day they gained some more ground, and one even seized its objective, having slogged a total of {{convert|6|mi|km}}, but the limited progress forced Hobbs to abandon the hope for a quick breakout.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=16}}\n\nIn addition to the poor roads, the 30th Division's breakout attempts were also hampered by the [[16th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|German 116th Panzer Division]]. The only potent unit left for commitment against the Allied Rhine crossings in the north, the 116th began moving south from the Dutch\u2013German border on 25 March against what the Germans considered their most dangerous threat, the U.S. 9th Army. The enemy armored unit began making its presence felt almost immediately, and by the end of 26 March the combination of the ''panzer'' division and the rough terrain had conspired to sharply limit the 30th Division's forward progress. With the 79th Infantry Division meeting fierce resistance to the south, Simpson's only recourse was to commit some of his forces waiting on the west bank of the Rhine. Late on 26 March, the 8th Armored Division began moving into the bridgehead.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=16}}\n\nAlthough the armored division bolstered his offensive capacity within the bridgehead, Simpson was more interested in sending the XIX Corps across the Wesel bridges, as Montgomery had agreed, and using the better roads north of the Lippe to outflank the enemy in front of the 30th Division. Unfortunately, because of pressure from the Germans in the northern part of the 2nd Army bridgehead, the British were having trouble completing their bridges at Xanten and were therefore bringing most of their traffic across the river at Wesel. With Montgomery allowing use of the Wesel bridges to the 9th Army for only five out of every 24 hours, and with the road network north of the Lippe under 2nd Army control, General Simpson was unable to commit or maneuver sufficient forces to make a rapid flanking drive.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=17}}\n\n=== German Army Group B surrounded in the Ruhr pocket (1 April) ===\n[[File:Encirclement of the Ruhr.jpg|thumb|300px|Encirclement of the Ruhr and other Allied operations between 29 March and 4 April 1945]]\nBy 28 March, the 8th Armored Division had expanded the bridgehead by only about {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} and still had not reached [[Dorsten]], a town about {{convert|15|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of the Rhine, whose road junction promised to expand the XVI Corps\u2032 offensive options. On the same day, however, Montgomery announced that the east bound roads out of Wesel would be turned over to the 9th Army on 30 March with the Rhine bridges leading into that city changing hands a day later. Also on 28 March, elements of the U.S. 17th Airborne Division operating north of the Lippe River in conjunction with British armored forces\u2014dashed to a point some {{convert|30|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of Wesel, opening a corridor for the XIX Corps and handily outflanking Dorsten and the enemy to the south. Simpson now had both the opportunity and the means to unleash the power of the 9th Army and begin in earnest the northern drive to surround the Ruhr.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=17}}\n\nSimpson began by moving elements of the XIX Corps\u2032 [[2nd Armored Division (United States)|2nd Armored Division]] into the XVI Corps bridgehead on 28 March with orders to cross the Lippe east of Wesel, thereby avoiding that city's traffic jams. After passing north of the Lippe on 29 March, the 2nd Armored Division broke out late that night from the forward position that the XVIII Airborne Corps had established around [[Haltern]], {{convert|12|mi|km|abbr=on}} northeast of Dorsten. On the 30th and 31st, the 2nd Armored made an uninterrupted {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} drive east to [[Beckum, Germany|Beckum]], cutting two of the Ruhr's three remaining rail lines and severing the [[autobahn]] to Berlin. As the rest of the XIX Corps flowed into the wake of this spectacular drive, the 1st Army was completing its equally remarkable thrust around the southern and eastern edges of the Ruhr.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=17}}\n\nThe 1st Army's drive from the Remagen bridgehead began with a breakout before dawn on 25 March. German Field Marshal Walter Model, whose ''Army Group B'' was charged with the defense of the Ruhr, had deployed his troops heavily along the east\u2013west [[Sieg]] River south of [[Cologne]], thinking that the Americans would attack directly north from the Remagen bridgehead. Instead, the 1st Army struck eastward, heading for [[Gie\u00dfen|Giessen]] and the [[Lahn River]], {{convert|65|mi|km|abbr=on}} beyond Remagen, before turning north toward Paderborn and a linkup with the 9th Army. All three corps of the 1st Army participated in the breakout, which on the first day employed five infantry and two armored divisions. The [[VII Corps (United States)|U.S. VII Corps]], on the left, had the hardest going due to the German concentration north of the bridgehead, yet its armored columns managed to advance {{convert|12|mi|km|abbr=on}} beyond their line of departure. The [[III Corps (United States)|U.S. III Corps]], in the center, did not commit its armor on the first day of the breakout, but still made a gain of {{convert|4|mi|km|abbr=on}}. The [[V Corps (United States)|U.S. V Corps]] on the right advanced {{convert|5|-|8|mi|km|abbr=on}}, incurring minimal casualties.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=20}}\n\nBeginning the next day, 26 March, the armored divisions of all three corps turned these initial gains into a complete breakout, shattering all opposition and roaming at will throughout the enemy's rear areas. By the end of 28 March, Hodges\u2032 1st Army had crossed the Lahn, having driven at least {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} beyond the original line of departure, capturing thousands of German soldiers in the process. Nowhere, it seemed, were the Germans able to resist in strength. On 29 March, the 1st Army turned toward Paderborn, about {{convert|80|mi|km|abbr=on}} north of Giessen, its right flank covered by the 3rd Army, which had broken out of its own bridgeheads and was headed northeast toward [[Battle of Kassel (1945)|Kassel]].{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=20}}\n\nA task force of the VII Corps\u2032 [[3rd Armored Division (United States)|3rd Armored Division]], which included some of the new [[M26 Pershing]] heavy tanks, spearheaded the drive for Paderborn on 29 March. By attaching an infantry regiment of the [[104th Infantry Division (United States)|104th Infantry Division]] to the armored division and following the drive closely with the rest of the 104th Division, the VII Corps was well prepared to hold any territory gained. Rolling northward {{convert|45|mi|km|abbr=on}} without casualties, the mobile force stopped for the night {{convert|15|mi|km|abbr=on}} from its objective. Taking up the advance again the next day, it immediately ran into stiff opposition from students of an SS ''panzer'' replacement training center located near Paderborn. Equipped with about 60 tanks, the students put up a fanatical resistance, stalling the American armor all day. When the task force failed to advance on 31 March, Maj. Gen. [[J. Lawton Collins]], commander of the VII Corps, asked Simpson if his 9th Army, driving eastward north of the Ruhr, could provide assistance. Simpson, in turn, ordered a combat command of the 2nd Armored Division, which had just reached Beckum, to make a {{convert|15|mi|km|abbr=on}} advance southeast to [[Lippstadt]], midway between Beckum and the stalled 3rd Armored Division spearhead. Early in the afternoon of 1 April elements of the 2nd and 3rd Armored Divisions met at Lippstadt, linking the 9th and 1st Armies and sealing the prized [[Ruhr Area|Ruhr industrial complex]], along with Model's ''Army Group B'', within American lines.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=20}}\n\nAs March turned to April the offensive east of the Rhine was progressing in close accordance with Allied plans. All the armies assigned to cross the Rhine had elements east of the river, including the Canadian 1st Army in the north, which sent a division through the British bridgehead at Rees, and the French 1st Army in the south, which on 31 March established its own bridgehead by assault crossings at [[Germersheim]] and [[Speyer]], about {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of Mainz. With spectacular thrusts being made beyond the Rhine nearly every day and the enemy's capacity to resist fading at an ever-accelerating rate, the campaign to finish Germany was transitioning into a general pursuit.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=21}}\n\nIn the center of the Allied line, Eisenhower inserted the new [[Fifteenth United States Army|15th Army]], under U.S. 12th Army Group control to hold the western edge of the [[Ruhr Pocket]] along the Rhine while the 9th and 1st Armies squeezed the remaining German defenders there from the north, east, and south. Following the reduction of the Ruhr, the 15th Army was to take over occupation duties in the region as the 9th,{{sfn|Universal Newsreel staff|1945}} 1st and 3rd Armies pushed farther into Germany.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=21}}\n\n=== Eisenhower switches his main thrust to U.S. 12th Army Group front (28 March) ===\nOn 28 March, as these developments unfolded, Eisenhower announced his decision to adjust his plans governing the future course of the offensive. Once the Ruhr was surrounded, he wanted the 9th Army transferred from the British 21st Army Group to the U.S. 12th Army Group. After the reduction of the Ruhr Pocket, the main thrust east would be made by Bradley's 12th Army Group in the center, rather than by Montgomery's 21st Army Group in the north as originally planned. Montgomery's forces were to secure Bradley's northern flank while Devers\u2032 6th U.S. Army Group covered Bradley's southern shoulder. Furthermore, the main objective was no longer Berlin, but [[Leipzig]] where a juncture with the Soviet Army would split the remaining German forces in two. Once this was done, the 21st Army Group would take [[L\u00fcbeck]] and [[Wismar]] on the [[Baltic Sea]], cutting off the Germans remaining in the [[Jutland]] peninsula of [[Denmark]], while the 6th U.S. Army Group and the 3rd Army drove south into Austria.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=21}}\n\nThe British Prime Minister and Chiefs of Staff strongly opposed the new plan. Despite the Russian proximity to Berlin, they argued that the city was still a critical political, if not military, objective. Eisenhower, supported by the American Chiefs of Staff, disagreed. His overriding objective was the swiftest military victory possible. Should the U.S. political leadership direct him to take Berlin, or if a situation arose in which it became militarily advisable to seize the German capital, Eisenhower would do so. Otherwise, he would pursue those objectives that would end the war soonest. In addition, since Berlin and the rest of Germany had already been divided into occupation zones by representatives of the Allied governments at the [[Yalta Conference]], Eisenhower saw no political advantage in a race for Berlin. Any ground the Western Allies gained in the future Soviet zone would merely be relinquished to the Soviets after the war. In the end the campaign proceeded as Eisenhower had planned it.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=22}}\n\n=== Ruhr pocket cleared (18 April) ===\n[[File:Advance through Germany - 5-18 April 1945.jpg|thumb|300px|The reduction of the Ruhr Pocket and advance to Elbe and Mulde rivers between 5 and 18 April 1945]]\n\nThe first step in realizing Eisenhower's plan was the eradication of the Ruhr Pocket. Even before the encirclement had been completed, the Germans in the Ruhr had begun making attempts at a breakout to the east. All had been unceremoniously repulsed by the vastly superior Allied forces. Meanwhile, the 9th and 1st Armies began preparing converging attacks using the east-west Ruhr River as a boundary line. The 9th Army's XVI Corps, which had taken up position north of the Ruhr area after crossing the Rhine, would be assisted in its southward drive by two divisions of the XIX Corps, the rest of which would continue to press eastward along with the XIII Corps. South of the Ruhr River, the 1st Army's northward attack was to be executed by the XVIII Airborne Corps, which had been transferred to Hodges after Operation Varsity, and the III Corps, with the 1st Army's V and VII Corps continuing the offensive east. The 9th Army's sector of the Ruhr Pocket, although only about 1/3 the size of the 1st Army's sector south of the river, contained the majority of the densely urbanized industrial area within the encirclement. The 1st Army's area, on the other hand, was composed of rough, heavily forested terrain with a poor road network.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|pp=22\u201323}}\n\nBy 1 April, when the trap closed around the Germans in the Ruhr, their fate was sealed. In a matter of days they would all be killed or captured. On 4 April, the day it shifted to Bradley's control, the 9th Army began its attack south toward the Ruhr River. In the south, the 1st Army's III Corps launched its strike on the 5th and the XVIII Airborne Corps joined in on the 6th, both pushing generally northward. German resistance, initially rather determined, dwindled rapidly. By 13 April, the 9th Army had cleared the northern part of the pocket, while elements of the XVIII Airborne Corps\u2032 [[8th Infantry Division (United States)|8th Infantry Division]] reached the southern bank of the Ruhr, splitting the southern section of the pocket in two. Thousands of prisoners were being taken every day; from 16\u201318 April, when all opposition ended and the remnants of German ''Army Group B'' formally surrendered, German troops had been surrendering in droves throughout the region. Army Group B commander Model committed suicide on 21 April.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=23}}\n\nThe final tally of prisoners taken in the Ruhr reached 325,000, far beyond anything the Americans had anticipated. Tactical commanders hastily enclosed huge open fields with barbed wire creating makeshift prisoner of war camps, where the inmates awaited the end of the war and their chance to return home. Also looking forward to going home, tens of thousands of freed forced laborers and Allied prisoners of war further strained the American logistical system.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=23}}\n\n=== U.S. 12th Army Group prepares its final thrust ===\nMeanwhile, the remaining Allied forces north, south, and east of the Ruhr had been adjusting their lines in preparation for the final advance through Germany. Under the new concept, Bradley's 12th U.S. Army Group would make the main effort, with Hodges' 1st Army in the center heading east for about {{convert|130|mi|km|abbr=on}} toward the city of Leipzig and the [[Elbe]] River. To the north, the 9th Army's XIX and XIII Corps would also drive for the Elbe, toward [[Magdeburg]], about {{convert|65|mi|km|abbr=on}} north of Leipzig, although the army commander, General Simpson, hoped he would be allowed to go all the way to Berlin. To the south, Patton's 3rd Army was to drive east to [[Chemnitz]], about {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} southeast of Leipzig, but well short of the Elbe, and then turn southeast into [[Austria]]. At the same time, General Devers' 6th U.S. Army Group would move south through [[Bavaria]] and the [[Black Forest]] to Austria and the [[Alps]], ending the threat of any Nazi last-ditch stand there.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|pp=23,26}}\n\nOn 4 April, as it paused to allow the rest of the 12th U.S. Army Group to catch up, the 3rd Army made two notable discoveries. Near the town of Merkers, elements of the 90th Infantry Division found a sealed salt mine containing a large portion of the German national treasure. The hoard included vast quantities of German paper currency, stacks of priceless paintings, piles of looted gold and silver jewelry and household objects, and an estimated $250,000,000 worth of gold bars and coins of various nations. But the other discovery made by the 3rd Army on 4 April horrified and angered those who saw it. When the 4th Armored Division and elements of the 89th Infantry Division captured the small town of [[Ohrdruf]], a few miles south of [[Gotha (town)|Gotha]], they found the [[Ohrdruf concentration camp|first concentration camp]] taken by the Western Allies.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=26}}\n\n=== U.S. 12th Army Group advances to the Elbe (9 April) ===\nThe 4 April pause in the 3rd Army advance allowed the other armies under Bradley's command to reach the [[Leine]] River, about {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of Paderborn. Thus all three armies of the 12th U.S. Army Group were in a fairly even north\u2013south line, enabling them to advance abreast of each other to the Elbe. By 9 April, both the 9th and 1st Armies had seized bridgeheads over the Leine, prompting Bradley to order an unrestricted eastward advance. On the morning of 10 April, the 12th U.S. Army Group's drive to the Elbe began in earnest.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=26}}\n\nThe Elbe River was the official eastward objective, but many American commanders still eyed Berlin. By the evening of 11 April, elements of the 9th Army's 2nd Armored Division\u2014seemingly intent on demonstrating how easily their army could take that coveted prize\u2014had dashed {{convert|73|mi|km|abbr=on}} to reach the Elbe southeast of Magdeburg, just {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} short of the German capital. On 12 April, additional 9th Army elements attained the Elbe and by the next day were on the opposite bank hopefully awaiting permission to drive on to Berlin. But two days later, on 15 April, they had to abandon these hopes. Eisenhower sent Bradley his final word on the matter: the 9th Army was to stay put\u2014there would be no effort to take Berlin. Simpson subsequently turned his troops' attention to mopping up pockets of local resistance.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=26}}\n[[File:Coburg1945.jpg|thumb|left|American tanks in Coburg on 25 April]]\n\nIn the center of the 12th U.S. Army Group, Hodges\u2032 1st Army faced somewhat stiffer opposition, though it hardly slowed the pace. As its forces approached Leipzig, about {{convert|60|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of Magdeburg and {{convert|15|mi|km|abbr=on}} short of the [[Mulde River]], the 1st Army ran into one of the few remaining centers of organized resistance. Here the Germans turned a thick defense belt of antiaircraft guns against the American ground troops with devastating effects. Through a combination of flanking movements and night attacks, First Army troops were able to destroy or bypass the guns, moving finally into Leipzig, which formally surrendered on the morning of 20 April. By the end of the day, the units that had taken Leipzig joined the rest of the 1st Army on the [[Mulde]], where it had been ordered to halt.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=27}}\n\nMeanwhile, on the 12th U.S. Army Group's southern flank, the 3rd Army had advanced apace, moving {{convert|30|mi|km|abbr=on}} eastward to take [[Erfurt]] and [[Weimar]], and then, by 12 April, another {{convert|30|mi|km|abbr=on}} through the old 1806 [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt|Jena Napoleonic battlefield]] area. On that day, Eisenhower instructed Patton to halt the 3rd Army at the Mulde River, about {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} short of its original objective, Chemnitz. The change resulted from an agreement between the American and Soviet military leadership based on the need to establish a readily identifiable geographical line to avoid accidental clashes between the converging Allied forces. However, as the 3rd Army began pulling up to the Mulde on 13 April, the XII Corps\u2014Patton's southernmost force\u2014continued moving southeast alongside the 6th U.S. Army Group to clear southern Germany and move into Austria. After taking [[Coburg]], about {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of Erfurt, on 11 April, XII Corps troops captured [[Bayreuth]], {{convert|35|mi|km|abbr=on}} farther southeast, on 14 April.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=30}}\n\nAs was the case throughout the campaign, the German ability to fight was sporadic and unpredictable during the drive to the [[Elbe\u2013Mulde line]]. Some areas were stoutly defended while in others the enemy surrendered after little more than token resistance. By sending armored spearheads around hotly contested areas, isolating them for reduction by subsequent waves of infantry, Eisenhower's forces maintained their eastward momentum. A German holdout force of 70,000 in the [[Harz]] Mountains\u2014{{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} north of Erfurt\u2014was neutralized in this way, as were the towns of Erfurt, [[Jena]], and Leipzig.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=30}}\n\n=== U.S. First Army makes first contact with the advancing Soviets (25 April) ===\n[[File:Final Operations - 19 April-7 Mai 1945.jpg|300px|thumb|The final operations of the Western Allied armies between 19 April and 7 May 1945 and the change in the Soviet front line over this period]]\n\nEvery unit along the Elbe\u2013Mulde line was anxious to be the first to meet the Red Army. By the last week of April, it was well known that the Soviets were close, and dozens of American patrols were probing beyond the east bank of the Mulde, hoping to meet them. Elements of the 1st Army's V Corps made first contact. At 11:30 on 25 April, a small patrol from the [[69th Infantry Division (United States)|69th Infantry Division]] met a lone Soviet horseman in the village of [[N\u00fcnchritz|Leckwitz]]. Several other patrols from the 69th had similar encounters later that day, and on 26 April the division commander, Maj. Gen. [[Emil F. Reinhardt]], met Maj. Gen. Vladimir Rusakov of the Russian 58th Guards Infantry Division at [[Torgau]] in the first official link-up ceremony.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=30}}\n<!-- Vladimir Rusakov needs a separate link on the disambugation page as only the Mexican painter is currently listed. -->\n\n25 April is known as [[Elbe Day]].\n\n=== U.S. 6th Army Group heads for Austria ===\nWhile the 12th U.S. Army Group made its eastward thrust, Devers\u2032 6th U.S. Army Group to the south had the dual mission of protecting the 12th U.S. Army Group's right flank and eliminating any German attempt to make a last stand in the Alps of southern Germany and western Austria. To accomplish both objectives, Patch's 7th Army on Devers\u2032 left was to make a great arc, first driving northeastward alongside Bradley's flank, then turning south with the 3rd Army to take [[Nuremberg]] and [[Munich]], ultimately continuing into Austria. The French 1st Army, under de Lattre de Tassigny, was to attack to the south and southeast, taking [[Stuttgart]] before moving to the Swiss border and into Austria.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=31}}\n\nInitially, the opposition in the 6th U.S. Army Group's sector was stiffer than that facing the 12th U.S. Army Group. The German forces there were simply in less disarray than those to the north. Nevertheless, the 7th Army broke out of its Rhine bridgehead, just south of [[Frankfurt]], on 28 March, employing elements of three corps\u2014the [[XV Corps (United States)|XV Corps]] to the north, the [[XXI Corps (United States)|XXI Corps]] in the center, and the [[VI Corps (United States)|VI Corps]] to the south. The XV Corps\u2032 [[45th Infantry Division (United States)|45th Infantry Division]] fought for six days before taking the city of [[Aschaffenburg]], {{convert|35|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of the Rhine, on 3 April. To the south, elements of the VI Corps met unexpectedly fierce resistance at [[Battle of Heilbronn (1945)|Heilbronn]], {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} into the German rear. Despite a wide armored thrust to envelop the enemy defenses, it took nine days of intense fighting to bring Heilbronn fully under American control. Still, by 11 April 7th Army had penetrated the German defenses in depth, especially in the north, and was ready to begin its wheeling movement southeast and south. Thus, on 15 April when Eisenhower ordered Patton's entire 3rd Army to drive southeast down the [[Danube]] River valley to [[Linz]], and south to [[Salzburg]] and central Austria, he also instructed the 6th U.S. Army Group to make a similar turn into southern Germany and western Austria.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|pp=31\u201332}}\n[[File:3.

In a double envelopment, the French captured Stuttgart on 21 April, and by the next day both the French and the VI Corps had elements on the Danube. Similarly, the 3rd Army on the 6th U.S. Army Group's left flank had advanced rapidly against very little resistance, its lead elements reaching the river on 24 April.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=32}}\n\nAs the 6th U.S. Army Group and the 3rd Army finished clearing southern Germany and approached Austria, it was clear to most observers, Allied and German alike, that the war was nearly over. Many towns flew white flags of surrender to spare themselves the otherwise inevitable destruction suffered by those that resisted, while German troops surrendered by the tens of thousands, sometimes as entire units.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=32}}\n\n=== Link-up of U.S. forces in Germany and Italy (4 May) ===\nOn 30 April, elements of 7th Army's XV and XXI Corps captured Munich, {{convert|30|mi|km}} south of the Danube, while the first elements of its VI Corps had already entered Austria two days earlier.

On 29 April, the British made an assault crossing of the Elbe, supported on the following day by the recently reattached XVIII Airborne Corps. The bridgehead expanded rapidly, and by 2 May Lubeck and Wismar, {{convert|40|-|50|mi|km}} beyond the river, were in Allied hands, sealing off the Germans in the Jutland Peninsula.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=33}}\n\nOn the 21st Army Group's left, one corps of the Canadian 1st Army reached the North Sea near the Dutch\u2013German border on 16 April, while another drove through the central Netherlands, trapping the German forces remaining in that country. However, concerned that the bypassed Germans would flood much of the nation and cause complete [[Dutch famine of 1944\u201345|famine]] among a Dutch population already near starvation, Eisenhower approved an agreement with the local German commanders to allow the Allies to air-drop food into the country in return for a local ceasefire on the battlefield. The [[Operations Manna and Chowhound|ensuing airdrops]], which began on 29 April,{{sfn|RAF staff|2005|loc=April 1945}} marked the beginning of what was to become a colossal effort to put war-torn Europe back together again.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nOn 6 May, the [[1st Armoured Division (Poland)]] seized the [[Kriegsmarine]] naval base in [[Wilhelmshaven]], where General Maczek accepted the capitulation of the fortress, naval base, East Frisian Fleet and more than 10 infantry divisions.\n\n=== German surrender (8 May) ===\n[[File:Allied army positions on 10 May 1945.png|right|thumb|Final positions of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] armies, May 1945]]\n{{Main|End of World War II in Europe}}\n\nBy the end of April, the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] was in tatters. Of the land still under Nazi control almost none was actually in Germany. With his escape route to the south severed by the 12th Army Group's eastward drive and Berlin surrounded by the Soviets, Hitler committed suicide on 30 April, leaving to his successor, [[Grand Admiral]] [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]], the task of capitulation. After attempting to strike a deal whereby he would surrender only to the Western Allies, a proposal that was summarily rejected on 7 May, D\u00f6nitz granted his representative, [[Alfred Jodl]], permission to effect a complete surrender on all fronts. The appropriate documents were signed on the same day and became effective on 8 May. Despite scattered resistance from a few isolated units, the war in Europe was over.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=34}}\n\n== Analysis ==\n[[File:U.S Airfields in Europa as of 8 May 1945.jpg|right|thumb|U.S. Airfields in Europe as of 8 May 1945]]\n\nBy the beginning of the Central Europe campaign, Allied victory in Europe was inevitable. Having gambled his future ability to defend Germany on the Ardennes offensive and lost, Hitler had no real strength left to stop the powerful Allied armies. The Western Allies still had to fight, often bitterly, for victory. Even when the hopelessness of the German situation became obvious to his most loyal subordinates, Hitler refused to admit defeat. Only when Soviet artillery was falling around his Berlin headquarters bunker did he begin to perceive the final outcome.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=34}}\n\nThe crossing of the Rhine, the encirclement and reduction of the Ruhr, and the sweep to the Elbe\u2013Mulde line and the Alps all established the final campaign on the Western Front as a showcase for Allied superiority in maneuver warfare. Drawing on the experience gained during the campaign in Normandy and the [[Allied advance from Paris to the Rhine]], the Western Allies demonstrated in Central Europe their capability of absorbing the lessons of the past. By attaching [[mechanized infantry]] units to armored divisions, they created a hybrid of strength and mobility that served them well in the pursuit warfare through Germany. Key to the effort was the logistical support that kept these forces fueled, and the determination to maintain the forward momentum at all costs. These mobile forces made great thrusts to isolate pockets of German troops, which were mopped up by additional infantry following close behind. The Allies rapidly eroded any remaining ability to resist.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|pp=34\u201335}}\n\nFor their part, captured German soldiers often claimed to be most impressed not by American armor or infantry but by the artillery. They frequently remarked on its accuracy and the swiftness of its target acquisition\u2014and especially the prodigious amount of artillery ammunition expended.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=35}}\n\nIn retrospect, very few questionable decisions were made concerning the execution of the campaign. For example, Patton potentially could have made his initial Rhine crossing north of Mainz and avoided the losses incurred crossing the Main. Further north the airborne landings during Operation Plunder in support of the 21st Army Group's crossing of the Rhine were probably not worth the risk. But because of the decisive efforts plotted by Patton was turned down, the losses couldn't be averted and by far can say the Allied victory was postponed up to an extent of a month.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=35}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe food situation in occupied Germany was initially very dire. By the spring of 1946 the official ration in the American zone was no more than {{convert|1275|Cal|kJ}} per day, with some areas probably receiving as little as {{convert|700|Cal|kJ}} per day. In the British zone the food situation was dire, as found during a visit by the British publisher [[Victor Gollancz]] in October and November 1946. In [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] the normal 28-day allocation should have been {{convert|1548|Cal|kJ}} including {{convert|10|kg}} of bread, but as there was limited grain the bread ration was only {{convert|8.5|kg}}. However, as there was only sufficient bread for about 50% of this \"called up\" ration, the total deficiency was about 50%, not 15% as stated in a ministerial reply in the British Parliament on 11 December. So only about {{convert|770|Cal|kJ}} would have been supplied, and he said the German winter ration would be {{convert|1000|Cal|kJ}} as the recent increase was \"largely mythical\". His book includes photos taken on the visit and critical letters and newspaper articles by him published in several British newspapers; ''The Times, the Daily Herald, the Manchester Guardian'', etc.<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Victor Gollancz|Gollancz, Victor]] |title= In Darkest Germany|year=1947 |publisher=Victor Gollancz, London|pages=116, 125\u20136 |quote= | url= |isbn= }}</ref>\n\nDuring and immediately following the invasion, vengeful US troops  engaged in mass rape.<ref>{{cite magazine |last= Wiegrefe|first= Klaus|date= 2 March 2015|title= Were Americans As Bad as the Soviets?|url= https://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/book-claims-us-soldiers-raped-190-000-german-women-post-wwii-a-1021298.html |magazine= Der Spiegel|location= Hamburg|publisher= Spiegel-Verlag|access-date= 28 December 2019}}</ref> Some occupation soldiers took advantage of the desperate food situation by exploiting their ample supply of food and cigarettes (the currency of the black market) to get to the local German girls as what became known as ''frau bait'' (''[[The New York Times]]'', 25 June 1945).

Washington, DC : Center of Military History, 1996. Page 202]).\n* West German military historian Burkhart M\u00fcller-Hillebrand (''Das Heer 1933\u20131945'' Vol 3. Page 262) estimated 265,000 dead from all causes and 1,012,000 missing and prisoners of war on all German battlefronts from Jan 1, 1945 \u2013 April 30, 1945. No breakdown of these figures between the various battlefronts was provided.\n* US Army historian Charles B. MacDonald (''The European Theater of Operations: The Last Offensive'', Center of Military History, United States Army, Washington D.C., 1993, page 478) holds that ''\"exclusive of prisoners of war, all German casualties in the west from D-day to V\u2013E Day probably equaled or slightly exceeded Allied losses\"''. In the related footnote he writes the following: ''\"The only specific figures available are from OB WEST for the period 2 June 1941\u201310 April 1945 as follows: Dead, 80,819; wounded, 265,526; missing, 490,624; total, 836,969. (Of the total, 4,548 casualties were incurred prior to D-day.) See Rpts, Der Heeresarzt im Oberkommando des Heeres Gen St d H/Gen Qu, Az.: 1335 c/d (IIb) Nr.: H.A./263/45 g. Kdos. of 14 Apr 45 and 1335 c/d (Ilb) (no date, but before 1945). The former is in OCMH X 313, a photostat of a document contained in German armament folder H 17/207; the latter in folder 0KW/1561 (OKW Wehrmacht Verluste). These figures are for the field army only, and do not include the Luftwaffe and Waffen-SS. Since the Germans seldom remained in control of the battlefield in a position to verify the status of those missing, a considerable percentage of the missing probably were killed. Time lag in reporting probably precludes these figures' reflecting the heavy losses during the Allied drive to the Rhine in March, and the cut-off date precludes inclusion of the losses in the Ruhr Pocket and in other stages of the fight in central Germany.\"''\n* German military historian R\u00fcdiger Overmans (''Deutsche milit\u00e4rische Verluste im Zweiten Weltkrieg'', Oldenbourg 2000, pp.265\u2013272) maintains, based on extrapolations from a statistical sample of the German military personnel records.(see [[German casualties in World War II]]), that the German armed forces suffered 1,230,045 deaths in the \"Final Battles\" on the Eastern and Western fronts from January to May 1945. This figure is broken down as follows (p. 272): 401,660 killed, 131,066 dead from other causes, 697,319 missing and presumed dead. According to Overmans the figures are calculated at \"todeszeitpunkt\" the point of death, which means the losses occurred between January to May 1945. The number of POW deaths in Western captivity calculated by Overmans, based on the actual reported cases is 76,000 (p. 286). Between 1962 and 1974 by a German government commission, the Maschke Commission put the figure at 31,300 in western captivity.(p. 286) Overmans maintains (pp. 275, 279) that all 1,230,045 deaths occurred during the period from January to May 1945. He states that there is not sufficient data to give an exact breakout of the 1.2 million dead in the final battles (p.174). He did however make a rough estimate of the allocation for total war losses of 5.3 million; 4 million (75%) on the Eastern front, 1 million (20%) in the West and 500,000 (10%) in other theaters. Up until Dec. 1944 losses in the West were 340,000, this indicates losses could be 400,000 to 600,000 deaths in the Western theater from January to May 1945 (p.265). Overmans does not consider the high losses in early 1945 surprising in view of the bitter fighting, he notes that there were many deaths in the Ruhr pocket (p.240) According to Overmans the total dead including POW deaths, in all theaters from Jan\u2013May 1945 was 1,407,000 (January-452,000; February-295,000; March-284,000; April-282,000; May-94,000) No breakout by theater for these losses is provided.(p.239)</ref><br>200,000 captured<br><small>(January\u2013March)</small><br>4,400,000 surrendered<br><small>(April\u2013June)</small><ref>R\u00fcdiger Overmans, Soldaten hinter Stacheldraht.

Col., Commanding Officer, ''Summary History of the [[289th Engineer Combat Battalion]] \u2013 WW II'', 1990, U.S. Army Heritage and Education Center, Carlisle, PA</ref> Combined with the capture of ''[[Berchtesgaden]]'', any hope of Nazi leadership continuing to wage war from a so-called \"[[National redoubt#Germany|National redoubt]]\" or escape through the Alps was crushed, shortly followed by unconditional German surrender on 8 May 1945. This is known as the \"Central Europe campaign\" in [[United States]] military histories.\n\nBy early 1945, events favored the Allied forces in Europe. On the [[Western Front (World War II)#Winter counter-offensives|Western Front]] the Allies had been fighting in Germany with campaigns against the [[Siegfried Line]] since the [[Battle of Aachen]] and the [[Battle of Hurtgen Forest]] in late 1944 and by January 1945 had pushed the Germans back to their starting points during the [[Battle of the Bulge]]. The failure of this offensive exhausted Germany's strategic reserve, leaving it ill-prepared to resist the final Allied campaigns in Europe. Additional losses in the [[Rhineland]] further weakened the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]], leaving shattered remnants of units to defend the east bank of the Rhine. On 7 March, the Allies [[Battle of Remagen|seized the last remaining intact]] [[Ludendorff Bridge|bridge]] across the Rhine at [[Remagen]], and had established a large [[bridgehead]] on the river's east bank. During Operation Lumberjack, [[Operation Plunder]] and Operation Undertone in March 1945, German casualties during February\u2013March 1945 are estimated at 400,000 men, including 280,000 men captured as [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]].{{sfn|Zaloga|Dennis|2006|p=88}}\n\nOn the [[Eastern Front (World War II)#Autumn 1944|Eastern Front]], the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] (including the [[Polish Armed Forces in the East]] under Soviet command) simultaneously with the Western Allies, had [[Vistula-Oder Offensive|taken most of Poland]] and began their offensive into Eastern Germany in February 1945, and by March were within striking distance of [[Berlin]]. The initial advance into Romania, the [[First Jassy\u2013Kishinev Offensive]] in April and May 1944 was a failure; the [[Jassy\u2013Kishinev Offensive|second Offensive]] in August succeeded. The Red Army also pushed deep into Hungary (the [[Budapest Offensive]]) and eastern [[Czechoslovakia]] and temporarily halted at what is now the modern German border on the [[Oder\u2013Neisse line]]. These rapid advances on the Eastern Front destroyed additional veteran German combat units and severely limited German F\u00fchrer [[Adolf Hitler]]'s ability to reinforce his Rhine defenses. With the Western Allies making final preparations for their powerful offensive into the German heartland, victory was imminent.\n\n== Order of battle ==\n\n=== Allied forces ===\nAt the very beginning of 1945, the [[Supreme Allied Commander|Supreme Commander]] of the Allied Expeditionary Force on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]], [[General (United States)|General]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], had 73 divisions under his command in North-western Europe, of which 49 were infantry divisions, 20 armored divisions and four airborne divisions. Forty-nine of these divisions were [[United States Army|American]], 12 [[British Army|British]], eight [[French Army|French]], three [[Canadian Army|Canadian]] and one [[Polish Armed Forces in the West|Polish]]. Another seven American divisions arrived during February,{{sfn|Hastings|2005|p=465}} along with the [[5th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|British 5th Infantry Division]] and [[I Canadian Corps]], both of which had arrived from the fighting on the [[Italian campaign (World War II)|Italian front]]. As the invasion of Germany commenced, Eisenhower had a total of 90 full-strength divisions under his command, with the number of armored divisions now reaching 25. The Allied front along the Rhine stretched {{convert|450|mi|km}} from the river's mouth at the North Sea in the Netherlands to the Swiss border in the south.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=3}}\n\nThe Allied forces along this line were organized into three army groups. In the north, from the North Sea to a point about {{convert|10|mi|km|}} north of Cologne, was the [[21st Army Group]] commanded by [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[Bernard Montgomery]]. Within 21st Army Group the [[First Canadian Army|Canadian 1st Army]] (under [[Harry Crerar]]) held the left flank of the Allied line, with the [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|British 2nd Army]] ([[Miles Dempsey|Miles C. Dempsey]]) in the center and the [[Ninth United States Army|U.S. 9th Army]] ([[William Hood Simpson]]) to the south. Holding the middle of the Allied line from the 9th Army's right flank to a point about {{convert|15|mi|km}} south of [[Mainz]] was the [[Twelfth United States Army Group|12th Army Group]] under the command of [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Omar Bradley]]. Bradley had two American armies, the [[First United States Army|U.S. 1st Army]] ([[Courtney Hodges]]) on the left (north) and the [[United States Army Central|U.S. 3rd Army]] ([[George S. Patton]]) on the right (south). Completing the Allied line to the Swiss border was the [[Sixth United States Army Group|6th Army Group]] commanded by Lieutenant General [[Jacob L. Devers]], with the [[Seventh United States Army|U.S. 7th Army]] ([[Alexander Patch]]) in the north and the [[First Army (France)|French 1st Army]] ([[Jean de Lattre de Tassigny]]) on the Allied right, and southernmost, flank.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|pp=3\u20136}}\n\nAs these three army groups cleared out the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' west of the Rhine, Eisenhower began to rethink his plans for the final drive across the Rhine and into the heart of Germany. Originally, Eisenhower had planned to draw all his forces up to the west bank of the Rhine, using the river as a natural barrier to help cover the inactive sections of his line. The main thrust beyond the river was to be made in the north by Montgomery's 21 Army Group, elements of which were to proceed east to a juncture with the U.S. 1st Army as it made a secondary advance northeast from below the [[Ruhr]] River. If successful, this pincer movement would envelop the industrial Ruhr area, neutralizing the largest concentration of German industrial capacity left.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=6}}\n\n=== German forces ===\nFacing the Allies was [[OB West|''Oberbefehlshaber West'']] (\"Army Command West\") commanded by [[Generalfeldmarschall]] [[Albert Kesselring]], who had taken over from Generalfeldmarschall [[Gerd von Rundstedt]] on 10 March. Although Kesselring brought an outstanding track record as a defensive strategist with him from the Italian campaign, he did not have the resources to make a coherent defense. During the fighting west of the Rhine up to March 1945, the German Army on the Western Front had been reduced to a strength of only 26 divisions, organized into three army groups (''[[Army Group H|H]]'', ''[[Army Group B|B]]'' and ''[[Army Group G|G]]''). Little or no reinforcement was forthcoming as the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]] continued to concentrate most forces against the Soviets; it was estimated that the Germans had 214 divisions on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] in April.{{sfn|Keegan|1989|p=182}}\n\nOn 21 March, Army Group H headquarters became ''Oberbefehlshaber Nordwest'' (\"Army Command Northwest\") commanded by [[Ernst Busch (military)|Ernst Busch]] leaving the former Army Group H commander\u2014[[Johannes Blaskowitz]]\u2014to lead \"Army Command Netherlands\" ([[25th Army (Wehrmacht)|25th Army]]) cut off in the Netherlands. Busch\u2014whose main unit was the [[1st Parachute Army (Wehrmacht)|German 1st Parachute Army]] \u2014was to form the right wing of the German defenses. In the center of the front, defending the Ruhr, Kesselring had Field Marshal [[Walther Model]] commanding Army Group B ([[15th Army (Wehrmacht)|15th Army]] and [[5th Panzer Army]]) and in the south [[Paul Hausser]]'s Army Group G ([[7th Army (Wehrmacht)|7th Army]], [[1st Army (Wehrmacht)|1st Army]] and [[19th Army (Wehrmacht)|19th Army]]).{{sfn|Keegan|1989|p=182}}<ref>{{cite web|first=Marcus|last=Wendel|url=http://www.axishistory.com/index.php?id=30|title= Heer|work=Axis History Factbook}}</ref>\n\n== Eisenhower's plans ==\nAfter capturing the Ruhr, Eisenhower planned to have the 21st Army Group continue its drive east across the [[North German Plain|plains of northern Germany]] to Berlin. The 12th and 6th Army Groups were to mount a subsidiary offensive to keep the Germans off balance and diminish their ability to stop the northern thrust. This secondary drive would also give Eisenhower a degree of flexibility in case the northern attack ran into difficulties.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=6}}\n\nFor several reasons, Eisenhower began to readjust these plans toward the end of March. First, his headquarters received reports that Soviet forces held a bridgehead over the [[Oder|Oder River]], {{convert|30|mi|km}} from Berlin. Since the Allied armies on the Rhine were more than {{convert|300|mi|km}} from Berlin, with the [[Elbe|Elbe River]], {{convert|200|mi|km}} ahead, still to be crossed it seemed clear that the Soviets would capture Berlin long before the Western Allies could reach it. Eisenhower thus turned his attention to other objectives, most notably a rapid meet-up with the Soviets to cut the German Army in two and prevent any possibility of a unified defense. Once this was accomplished the remaining German forces could be [[defeat in detail|defeated in detail]].{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=6}}\n\nIn addition, there was the matter of the Ruhr. Although the Ruhr area still contained a significant number of Axis troops and enough industry to retain its importance as a major objective, Allied intelligence reported that much of the region's armament industry was moving southeast, deeper into Germany. This increased the importance of the southern offensives across the Rhine.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=6}}\n\nAlso focusing Eisenhower's attention on the southern drive was concern over the \"[[National redoubt#Germany|National redoubt]].\" According to rumor, Hitler's most fanatically loyal troops were preparing to make a lengthy, last-ditch stand in the natural fortresses formed by the rugged alpine mountains of southern Germany and western Austria. If they held out for a year or more, dissension between the Soviet Union and the Western Allies might give them political leverage for some kind of favorable peace settlement. In reality, by the time of the Allied Rhine crossings the ''Wehrmacht'' had suffered such severe defeats on both the Eastern and Western Fronts that it could barely manage to mount effective delaying actions, much less muster enough troops to establish a well-organized alpine resistance force. Still, Allied intelligence could not entirely discount the possibility that remnants of the German forces would attempt a suicidal last stand in the Alps. Denying this opportunity became another argument for rethinking the role of the southern drive through Germany.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=7}}\n\nPerhaps the most compelling reason for increasing the emphasis on this southern drive had more to do with the actions of Americans than those of Germans. While Montgomery was carefully and cautiously planning for the main thrust in the north, complete with massive artillery preparation and an airborne assault, American forces in the south were displaying the kind of basic aggressiveness that Eisenhower wanted to see. On 7 March, Hodges's U.S. 1st Army [[Battle of Remagen|captured]] the last intact [[Ludendorff Bridge|bridge over the Rhine]] at [[Remagen]] and steadily expanded the [[bridgehead]].{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=7}}\n\nTo the south in the [[Saarpfalz-Kreis|Saar-Palatinate]] region, Patton's U.S. 3rd Army had dealt a devastating blow to the German 7th Army and, in conjunction with the U.S. 7th Army, had nearly destroyed the German 1st Army. In five days of battle, from 18\u201322 March, Patton's forces captured over 68,000 Germans. These bold actions eliminated the last German positions west of the Rhine. Although Montgomery's drive was still planned as the main effort, Eisenhower believed that the momentum of the American forces to the south should not be squandered by having them merely hold the line at the Rhine or make only limited diversionary attacks beyond it. By the end of March, the Supreme Commander thus leaned toward a decision to place more responsibility on his southern forces. The events of the first few days of the final campaign would be enough to convince him that this was the proper course of action.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=7}}\n\n== Occupation process ==\nWhen Allied soldiers arrived in a town, its leaders and remaining residents typically used white flags, bedsheets, and tablecloths to signal surrender. The officer in charge of the unit capturing the area, typically a company or battalion, accepted responsibility over the town. Soldiers posted copies of General Eisenhower's ''[[:de:File:Proklamation Nr. 1 - Zweisprachige Bekanntmachung des Obersten Befehlshabers der alliierten Streitkr\u00e4fte Dwight D. Eisenhower (deutschsprachiger Teil).jpg|Proclamation No. 1]]'', which began with \"We come as a victorious army, not as oppressors.\" The proclamation demanded compliance with all orders by the commanding officer, instituted a strict curfew and limited travel, and confiscated all communications equipment and weapons. After a day or two, specialized [[Office of Military Government, United States]] (OMGUS) units took over. Soldiers requisitioned housing and office space as needed from residents. At first this was done informally with occupants evicted immediately and taking with them few personal possessions, but the process became standardized, with three hours' notice and OMGUS personnel providing receipts for buildings' contents. The displaced residents nonetheless had to find housing on their own.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=38\u201339}}\n\n== Operations ==\nOn 19 March, Eisenhower told Bradley to prepare the 1st Army for a breakout from the Remagen bridgehead any time after 22 March. The same day, in response to the 3rd Army's robust showing in the Saar-Palatinate region, and to have another strong force on the Rhine's east bank guarding the 1st Army's flank, Bradley gave Patton the go-ahead for an assault crossing of the Rhine as soon as possible.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=8}}\n\nThese were exactly the orders Patton had hoped for, he felt that if a sufficiently strong force could be thrown across the river and significant gains made, then Eisenhower might transfer responsibility for the main drive through Germany from Montgomery's 21st Army Group to Bradley's 12th. Patton also appreciated the opportunity he now had to beat Montgomery across the river and win for the 3rd Army the coveted distinction of making the first assault crossing of the Rhine in modern history. To accomplish this, he had to move quickly.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=8}}\n\nOn 21 March, Patton ordered his [[XII Corps (United States)|XII Corps]] to prepare for an assault over the Rhine on the following night, one day before Montgomery's scheduled crossing. While this was short notice, it did not catch the XII Corps completely unaware. As soon as Patton had received the orders on the 19th to make a crossing, he had begun sending assault boats, bridging equipment and other supplies forward from depots in [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]] where they had been stockpiled since autumn in the expectation of just such an opportunity. Seeing this equipment moving up, his frontline soldiers did not need any orders from higher headquarters to tell them what it meant.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=9}}\n\nThe location of the river-crossing assault was critical. Patton knew that the most obvious place to jump the river was at Mainz or just downstream, north of the city. The choice was obvious because the [[Main River]], flowing northward {{convert|30|mi|km}} east of and parallel to the Rhine, turns west and empties into the Rhine at Mainz and an advance south of the city would involve crossing two rivers rather than one. However, Patton also realized that the Germans were aware of this difficulty and would expect his attack north of Mainz. Thus, he decided to feint at Mainz while making his real effort at [[Nierstein-Oppenheim|Nierstein and Oppenheim]], {{convert|9|-|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of the city. Following this primary assault, which XII Corps would undertake, [[VIII Corps (United States)|VIII Corps]] would execute supporting crossings at [[Boppard]] and [[Sankt Goar|St. Goar]], {{convert|25|-|30|mi|km}} northwest of Mainz.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=9}}\n\nThe terrain in the vicinity of Nierstein and Oppenheim was conducive to artillery support, with high ground on the west bank overlooking relatively flat land to the east. However, the same flat east bank meant that the bridgehead would have to be rapidly and powerfully reinforced and expanded beyond the river since there was no high ground for a bridgehead defense. The importance of quickly obtaining a deep bridgehead was increased by the fact that the first access to a decent road network was over {{convert|6|mi|km}} inland at the town of Gro\u00df- Gerau.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=9}}\n\n=== U.S. 12th Army Group crosses the Rhine (22 March) ===\n[[File:Crossing of the Rhine.jpg|thumb|The crossing of the Rhine between 22 and 28 March 1945]]\nOn 22 March, with a bright moon lighting the late-night sky, elements of U.S. XII Corps\u2032 [[5th Infantry Division (United States)|5th Infantry Division]] began the 3rd Army's Rhine crossing. At Nierstein assault troops did not meet any resistance. As the first boats reached the east bank, seven startled Germans surrendered and then paddled themselves unescorted to the west bank to be placed in custody. Upstream at Oppenheim, however, the effort did not proceed so casually. The first wave of boats was halfway across when the Germans began pouring machine-gun fire into their midst. An intense exchange of fire lasted for about thirty minutes as assault boats kept pushing across the river and those men who had already made it across mounted attacks against the scattered defensive strongpoints. Finally the Germans surrendered, and by midnight units moved out laterally to consolidate the crossing sites and to attack the first villages beyond the river. German resistance everywhere was sporadic, and the hastily mounted counterattacks invariably burned out quickly, causing few casualties. The Germans lacked both the manpower and the heavy equipment to make a more determined defense.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|pp=9\u201310}}\n\nBy midafternoon on 23 March, all three regiments of the 5th Infantry Division were in the bridgehead, and an attached regiment from the [[90th Infantry Division (United States)|90th Infantry Division]] was crossing. Tanks and tank destroyers had been ferried across all morning, and by evening a [[Treadway bridge]] was open to traffic. By midnight, infantry units had pushed the boundary of the bridgehead more than {{convert|5|mi|km}} inland, ensuring the unqualified success of the first modern assault crossing of the Rhine.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=10}}\n\nTwo more 3rd Army crossings\u2014both by VIII Corps\u2014quickly followed. In the early morning hours of 25 March, elements of the [[87th Infantry Division (United States)|87th Infantry Division]] crossed the Rhine to the north at Boppard, and then some 24 hours later elements of the [[89th Infantry Division (United States)|89th Infantry Division]] crossed {{convert|8|mi|km}} south of Boppard at St. Goar. Although the defense of these sites was somewhat more determined than that XII Corps had faced, the difficulties of the Boppard and St. Goar crossings were compounded more by terrain than by German resistance. VIII Corps crossing sites were located along the [[Rhine Gorge]], where the river had carved a deep chasm between two mountain ranges, creating precipitous canyon walls over {{convert|300|ft|m}} high on both sides. In addition, the river flowed quickly and with unpredictable currents along this part of its course. Still, despite the terrain and German machine-gun and {{convert|20|mm|in|2}} [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] [[Autocannon|cannon]] fire, VIII Corps troops managed to gain control of the east bank's heights, and by dark on 26 March, with German resistance crumbling all along the Rhine, they were preparing to continue the drive the next morning.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=11}}\n\n=== U.S. 6th Army Group crosses the Rhine (26 March) ===\nAdding to the Germans\u2032 woes, the 6th Army Group made an assault across the Rhine on 26 March. At [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], about {{convert|25|mi|km}} south of Mainz, the 7th Army's [[XV Corps (United States)|XV Corps]] established a bridgehead, which it consolidated with the southern shoulder of the 3rd Army's bridgehead early the next day. After overcoming stiff initial resistance, XV Corps also advanced beyond the Rhine, opposed primarily by small German strongpoints sited in roadside villages.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=11}}\n\n=== British 21st Army Group plans ''Operation Plunder'' ===\nOn the night of 23/24 March, after the XII Corps\u2032 assault of the Rhine, Bradley had announced his success. The 12th Army Group commander said that American troops could cross the Rhine anywhere, without aerial bombardment or airborne troops, a direct jab at Montgomery whose troops were at that very moment preparing to launch their own Rhine assault following an intense and elaborate aerial and artillery preparation and with the assistance of two airborne divisions, the American [[17th Airborne Division (United States)|17th]] and the British [[6th Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|6th]].{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=11}}\n\nMontgomery was exhibiting his now legendary meticulous and circumspect approach to such enterprises, a lesson he had learned early in the [[North African campaign]]. Thus, as his forces had approached the east bank of the river, Montgomery proceeded with one of the most intensive buildups of material and manpower of the war. His detailed plans, code-named [[Operation Plunder]], were comparable to the Normandy invasion in terms of numbers of men and extent of equipment, supplies, and ammunition to be used. The 21st Army Group had 30 full-strength divisions, 11 each in the British 2nd and U.S. 9th Armies and eight in the Canadian 1st Army, providing Montgomery with more than 1,250,000 men.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=11}}\n\nPlunder called for the 2nd Army to cross at three locations along the 21st Army Group front\u2014at [[Rees, Germany|Rees]], [[Xanten]] and [[Rheinberg]]. The crossings would be preceded by several weeks of aerial bombing and a final massive artillery preparation. A heavy bombing campaign by [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] and [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] forces, known as the \"Interdiction of Northwest Germany\", designed primarily to destroy the [[Line of communication|lines of communication]] and supply connecting the Ruhr to the rest of Germany had been underway since February.<ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/AAF/III/AAF-III-21.html Chapter 21: From the Rhine to the Elbe]</ref> The intention was to create a line from Bremen south to Neuwied. The main targets were rail yards, bridges and communication centers, with a secondary focus on fuel processing and storage facilities and other important industrial sites. During the three days leading up to Montgomery's attack, targets in front of the 21st Army Group zone and in the Ruhr area to the southeast were pummeled by about 11,000 sorties, effectively sealing off the Ruhr while easing the burden on Montgomery's assault forces.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=12}}\n\nMontgomery had originally planned to attach one corps of the U.S. 9th Army to the British 2nd Army, which would use only two of the corps\u2032 divisions for the initial assault. The rest of the 9th Army would remain in reserve until the bridgehead was ready for exploitation. The 9th Army's commander, Lieutenant General William Hood Simpson and the 2nd Army's Lieutenant-General Miles C. Dempsey took exception to this approach. Both believed that the plan squandered the great strength in men and equipment that the 9th Army had assembled and ignored the many logistical problems of placing the 9th Army's crossing sites within the 2nd Army's zone.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=12}}\n\nMontgomery responded to these concerns by making a few small adjustments to the plan. Although he declined to increase the size of the American crossing force beyond two divisions, he agreed to keep it under 9th Army rather than 2nd Army control. To increase Simpson's ability to bring his army's strength to bear for exploitation, Montgomery also agreed to turn the bridges at [[Wesel]], just north of the inter-army boundary, over to the 9th Army once the bridgehead had been secured.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=12}}\n\nIn the southernmost sector of the 21st Army Group's attack, the 9th Army's assault divisions were to cross the Rhine along an {{convert|11|mi|km}} section of the front, south of Wesel and the [[Lippe River]]. This force would block any German counterattack from the Ruhr. Because of the poor road network on the east bank of this part of the Rhine, a second 9th Army corps was to cross over the promised Wesel bridges through the British zone north of the Lippe River, which had an abundance of good roads. After driving east nearly {{convert|100|mi|km}}, this corps was to meet elements of the 1st Army near [[Paderborn]], completing the encirclement of the Ruhr.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=12}}\n\nAnother important aspect of Montgomery's plan was [[Operation Varsity]], in which two divisions of Major General [[Matthew Ridgway]]'s [[XVIII Airborne Corps]] were to make an airborne assault over the Rhine. In a departure from standard airborne doctrine, which called for a jump deep behind enemy lines several hours prior to an amphibious assault, Varsity\u2032s drop zones were close behind the German front, within Allied artillery range. Additionally, to avoid being caught in the artillery preparation, the paratroopers would jump only after the amphibious troops had reached the Rhine's east bank. The wisdom of putting lightly-armed paratroopers so close to the main battlefield was debated, and the plan for amphibious forces to cross the Rhine prior to the parachute drop raised questions as to the utility of making an airborne assault at all. However, Montgomery believed that the paratroopers would quickly link up with the advancing river assault forces, placing the strongest force within the bridgehead as rapidly as possible. Once the bridgehead was secured the British 6th Airborne Division would be transferred to 2nd Army control, while the U.S. 17th Airborne Division would revert to 9th Army control.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=13}}\n\n=== Montgomery launches ''Operation Plunder'' (23 March) ===\n{{Main|Operation Plunder}}\nPlunder began on the evening of 23 March with the assault elements of the British 2nd Army massed against three main crossing sites: Rees in the north, Xanten in the center, and Wesel in the south. The two 9th Army divisions tasked for the assault concentrated in the Rheinberg area south of Wesel. At the northern crossing site, elements of [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|British XXX Corps]] began the assault (Operation Turnscrew) about 21:00, attempting to distract the Germans from the main crossings at Xanten in the center and Rheinberg to the south. The initial assault waves crossed the river quickly, meeting only light opposition. Meanwhile, Operation Widgeon began {{convert|2|mi|km}} north of Wesel as the 2nd Army's [[1st Special Service Brigade|1st Commando Brigade]] slipped across the river and waited within {{convert|1|mi}} of the city while it was demolished by one thousand tons of bombs delivered by [[RAF Bomber Command]]. Entering in the night, the commandos secured the city late on the morning of 24 March, although scattered resistance continued until dawn on the 25th. The 2nd Army's [[XII Corps (United Kingdom)|XII Corps]] and the 9th Army's [[XVI Corps (United States)|XVI Corps]] began the main effort about 02:00 on 24 March, following a massive artillery and air bombardment.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=13}}\n\nFor the American crossing, Simpson had chosen the veteran [[30th Infantry Division (United States)|30th]] and [[79th Infantry Division (United States)|79th Infantry Divisions]] of the XVI Corps. The 30th was to cross between Wesel and Rheinberg while the 79th assaulted south of Rheinberg. In reserve were the XVI Corps\u2032 [[8th Armored Division (United States)|8th Armored Division]], and [[35th Infantry Division (United States)|35th]] and [[75th Infantry Division (United States)|75th Infantry Divisions]], as well as the 9th Army's [[XIII Corps (United States)|XIII]] and [[XIX Corps (United States)|XIX Corps]], each with three divisions. Simpson planned to commit the XIX Corps as soon as possible after the bridgehead had been secured, using the XIII Corps to hold the Rhine south of the crossing sites.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=13}}\n\nAfter an hour of extremely intense artillery preparation, which Eisenhower himself viewed from the front, the 30th Infantry Division began its assault. The artillery fire had been so effective and so perfectly timed that the assault battalions merely motored their storm boats across the river and claimed the east bank against almost no resistance. As subsequent waves of troops crossed, units fanned out to take the first villages beyond the river to only the weakest of opposition. An hour later, at 03:00, the 79th Infantry Division began its crossing upriver, achieving much the same results. As heavier equipment was ferried across the Rhine, both divisions began pushing east, penetrating {{convert|3|-|6|mi|km}} into the German defensive line that day.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=16}}\n\n[[File:C-47 transport planes release hundreds of paratroops.jpg|thumb|left|[[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Douglas C-47]] transport aircraft drop hundreds of paratroopers on 24 March as part of [[Operation Varsity]].]]\n\nTo the north, the British crossings had also gone well, with the ground and airborne troops linking up by nightfall. By then, the paratroopers had taken all their first day's objectives in addition to 3,500 prisoners.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=16}}\n\nTo the south, the discovery of a defensive gap in front of the 30th Infantry Division fostered the hope that a full-scale breakout would be possible on 25 March. When limited objective attacks provoked little response on the morning of the 25th, the division commander Major General [[Leland Hobbs]] formed two mobile task forces to make deeper thrusts with an eye toward punching through the defense altogether and breaking deep into the German rear. However, Hobbs had not fully taken into account the nearly nonexistent road network in front of the XVI Corps bridgehead. Faced with trying to make rapid advances through dense forest on rutted dirt roads and muddy trails, which could be strongly defended by a few determined soldiers and well placed roadblocks, the task forces advanced only about {{convert|2|mi|km}} on the 25th. The next day they gained some more ground, and one even seized its objective, having slogged a total of {{convert|6|mi|km}}, but the limited progress forced Hobbs to abandon the hope for a quick breakout.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=16}}\n\nIn addition to the poor roads, the 30th Division's breakout attempts were also hampered by the [[16th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|German 116th Panzer Division]]. The only potent unit left for commitment against the Allied Rhine crossings in the north, the 116th began moving south from the Dutch\u2013German border on 25 March against what the Germans considered their most dangerous threat, the U.S. 9th Army. The enemy armored unit began making its presence felt almost immediately, and by the end of 26 March the combination of the ''panzer'' division and the rough terrain had conspired to sharply limit the 30th Division's forward progress. With the 79th Infantry Division meeting fierce resistance to the south, Simpson's only recourse was to commit some of his forces waiting on the west bank of the Rhine. Late on 26 March, the 8th Armored Division began moving into the bridgehead.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=16}}\n\nAlthough the armored division bolstered his offensive capacity within the bridgehead, Simpson was more interested in sending the XIX Corps across the Wesel bridges, as Montgomery had agreed, and using the better roads north of the Lippe to outflank the enemy in front of the 30th Division. Unfortunately, because of pressure from the Germans in the northern part of the 2nd Army bridgehead, the British were having trouble completing their bridges at Xanten and were therefore bringing most of their traffic across the river at Wesel. With Montgomery allowing use of the Wesel bridges to the 9th Army for only five out of every 24 hours, and with the road network north of the Lippe under 2nd Army control, General Simpson was unable to commit or maneuver sufficient forces to make a rapid flanking drive.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=17}}\n\n=== German Army Group B surrounded in the Ruhr pocket (1 April) ===\n[[File:Encirclement of the Ruhr.jpg|thumb|300px|Encirclement of the Ruhr and other Allied operations between 29 March and 4 April 1945]]\nBy 28 March, the 8th Armored Division had expanded the bridgehead by only about {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} and still had not reached [[Dorsten]], a town about {{convert|15|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of the Rhine, whose road junction promised to expand the XVI Corps\u2032 offensive options. On the same day, however, Montgomery announced that the east bound roads out of Wesel would be turned over to the 9th Army on 30 March with the Rhine bridges leading into that city changing hands a day later. Also on 28 March, elements of the U.S. 17th Airborne Division operating north of the Lippe River in conjunction with British armored forces\u2014dashed to a point some {{convert|30|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of Wesel, opening a corridor for the XIX Corps and handily outflanking Dorsten and the enemy to the south. Simpson now had both the opportunity and the means to unleash the power of the 9th Army and begin in earnest the northern drive to surround the Ruhr.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=17}}\n\nSimpson began by moving elements of the XIX Corps\u2032 [[2nd Armored Division (United States)|2nd Armored Division]] into the XVI Corps bridgehead on 28 March with orders to cross the Lippe east of Wesel, thereby avoiding that city's traffic jams. After passing north of the Lippe on 29 March, the 2nd Armored Division broke out late that night from the forward position that the XVIII Airborne Corps had established around [[Haltern]], {{convert|12|mi|km|abbr=on}} northeast of Dorsten. On the 30th and 31st, the 2nd Armored made an uninterrupted {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} drive east to [[Beckum, Germany|Beckum]], cutting two of the Ruhr's three remaining rail lines and severing the [[autobahn]] to Berlin. As the rest of the XIX Corps flowed into the wake of this spectacular drive, the 1st Army was completing its equally remarkable thrust around the southern and eastern edges of the Ruhr.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=17}}\n\nThe 1st Army's drive from the Remagen bridgehead began with a breakout before dawn on 25 March. German Field Marshal Walter Model, whose ''Army Group B'' was charged with the defense of the Ruhr, had deployed his troops heavily along the east-west [[Sieg]] River south of [[Cologne]], thinking that the Americans would attack directly north from the Remagen bridgehead. Instead, the 1st Army struck eastward, heading for [[Gie\u00dfen|Giessen]] and the [[Lahn River]], {{convert|65|mi|km|abbr=on}} beyond Remagen, before turning north toward Paderborn and a linkup with the 9th Army. All three corps of the 1st Army participated in the breakout, which on the first day employed five infantry and two armored divisions. The [[VII Corps (United States)|U.S. VII Corps]], on the left, had the hardest going due to the German concentration north of the bridgehead, yet its armored columns managed to advance {{convert|12|mi|km|abbr=on}} beyond their line of departure. The [[III Corps (United States)|U.S. III Corps]], in the center, did not commit its armor on the first day of the breakout, but still made a gain of {{convert|4|mi|km|abbr=on}}. The [[V Corps (United States)|U.S. V Corps]] on the right advanced {{convert|5|-|8|mi|km|abbr=on}}, incurring minimal casualties.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=20}}\n\nBeginning the next day, 26 March, the armored divisions of all three corps turned these initial gains into a complete breakout, shattering all opposition and roaming at will throughout the enemy's rear areas. By the end of 28 March, Hodges\u2032 1st Army had crossed the Lahn, having driven at least {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} beyond the original line of departure, capturing thousands of German soldiers in the process. Nowhere, it seemed, were the Germans able to resist in strength. On 29 March, the 1st Army turned toward Paderborn, about {{convert|80|mi|km|abbr=on}} north of Giessen, its right flank covered by the 3rd Army, which had broken out of its own bridgeheads and was headed northeast toward [[Battle of Kassel (1945)|Kassel]].{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=20}}\n\nA task force of the VII Corps\u2032 [[3rd Armored Division (United States)|3rd Armored Division]], which included some of the new [[M26 Pershing]] heavy tanks, spearheaded the drive for Paderborn on 29 March. By attaching an infantry regiment of the [[104th Infantry Division (United States)|104th Infantry Division]] to the armored division and following the drive closely with the rest of the 104th Division, the VII Corps was well prepared to hold any territory gained. Rolling northward {{convert|45|mi|km|abbr=on}} without casualties, the mobile force stopped for the night {{convert|15|mi|km|abbr=on}} from its objective. Taking up the advance again the next day, it immediately ran into stiff opposition from students of an SS ''panzer'' replacement training center located near Paderborn. Equipped with about 60 tanks, the students put up a fanatical resistance, stalling the American armor all day. When the task force failed to advance on 31 March, Maj. Gen. [[J. Lawton Collins]], commander of the VII Corps, asked Simpson if his 9th Army, driving eastward north of the Ruhr, could provide assistance. Simpson, in turn, ordered a combat command of the 2nd Armored Division, which had just reached Beckum, to make a {{convert|15|mi|km|abbr=on}} advance southeast to [[Lippstadt]], midway between Beckum and the stalled 3rd Armored Division spearhead. Early in the afternoon of 1 April elements of the 2nd and 3rd Armored Divisions met at Lippstadt, linking the 9th and 1st Armies and sealing the prized [[Ruhr Area|Ruhr industrial complex]], along with Model's ''Army Group B'', within American lines.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=20}}\n\nAs March turned to April the offensive east of the Rhine was progressing in close accordance with Allied plans. All the armies assigned to cross the Rhine had elements east of the river, including the Canadian 1st Army in the north, which sent a division through the British bridgehead at Rees, and the French 1st Army in the south, which on 31 March established its own bridgehead by assault crossings at [[Germersheim]] and [[Speyer]], about {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of Mainz. With spectacular thrusts being made beyond the Rhine nearly every day and the enemy's capacity to resist fading at an ever-accelerating rate, the campaign to finish Germany was transitioning into a general pursuit.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=21}}\n\nIn the center of the Allied line, Eisenhower inserted the new [[Fifteenth United States Army|15th Army]], under U.S. 12th Army Group control to hold the western edge of the [[Ruhr Pocket]] along the Rhine while the 9th and 1st Armies squeezed the remaining German defenders there from the north, east, and south. Following the reduction of the Ruhr, the 15th Army was to take over occupation duties in the region as the 9th,{{sfn|Universal Newsreel staff|1945}} 1st and 3rd Armies pushed farther into Germany.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=21}}\n\n=== Eisenhower switches his main thrust to U.S. 12th Army Group front (28 March) ===\nOn 28 March, as these developments unfolded, Eisenhower announced his decision to adjust his plans governing the future course of the offensive. Once the Ruhr was surrounded, he wanted the 9th Army transferred from the British 21st Army Group to the U.S. 12th Army Group. After the reduction of the Ruhr Pocket, the main thrust east would be made by Bradley's 12th Army Group in the center, rather than by Montgomery's 21st Army Group in the north as originally planned. Montgomery's forces were to secure Bradley's northern flank while Devers\u2032 6th U.S. Army Group covered Bradley's southern shoulder. Furthermore, the main objective was no longer Berlin, but [[Leipzig]] where a juncture with the Soviet Army would split the remaining German forces in two. Once this was done, the 21st Army Group would take [[L\u00fcbeck]] and [[Wismar]] on the [[Baltic Sea]], cutting off the Germans remaining in the [[Jutland]] peninsula of [[Denmark]], while the 6th U.S. Army Group and the 3rd Army drove south into Austria.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=21}}\n\nThe British Prime Minister and Chiefs of Staff strongly opposed the new plan. Despite the Russian proximity to Berlin, they argued that the city was still a critical political, if not military, objective. Eisenhower, supported by the American Chiefs of Staff, disagreed. His overriding objective was the swiftest military victory possible. Should the U.S. political leadership direct him to take Berlin, or if a situation arose in which it became militarily advisable to seize the German capital, Eisenhower would do so. Otherwise, he would pursue those objectives that would end the war soonest. In addition, since Berlin and the rest of Germany had already been divided into occupation zones by representatives of the Allied governments at the [[Yalta Conference]], Eisenhower saw no political advantage in a race for Berlin. Any ground the Western Allies gained in the future Soviet zone would merely be relinquished to the Soviets after the war. In the end the campaign proceeded as Eisenhower had planned it.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=22}}\n\n=== Ruhr pocket cleared (18 April) ===\n[[File:Advance through Germany - 5-18 April 1945.jpg|thumb|300px|The reduction of the Ruhr Pocket and advance to Elbe and Mulde rivers between 5 and 18 April 1945]]\n\nThe first step in realizing Eisenhower's plan was the eradication of the Ruhr Pocket. Even before the encirclement had been completed, the Germans in the Ruhr had begun making attempts at a breakout to the east. All had been unceremoniously repulsed by the vastly superior Allied forces. Meanwhile, the 9th and 1st Armies began preparing converging attacks using the east-west Ruhr River as a boundary line. The 9th Army's XVI Corps, which had taken up position north of the Ruhr area after crossing the Rhine, would be assisted in its southward drive by two divisions of the XIX Corps, the rest of which would continue to press eastward along with the XIII Corps. South of the Ruhr River, the 1st Army's northward attack was to be executed by the XVIII Airborne Corps, which had been transferred to Hodges after Operation Varsity, and the III Corps, with the 1st Army's V and VII Corps continuing the offensive east. The 9th Army's sector of the Ruhr Pocket, although only about 1/3 the size of the 1st Army's sector south of the river, contained the majority of the densely urbanized industrial area within the encirclement. The 1st Army's area, on the other hand, was composed of rough, heavily forested terrain with a poor road network.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|pp=22\u201323}}\n\nBy 1 April, when the trap closed around the Germans in the Ruhr, their fate was sealed. In a matter of days they would all be killed or captured. On 4 April, the day it shifted to Bradley's control, the 9th Army began its attack south toward the Ruhr River. In the south, the 1st Army's III Corps launched its strike on the 5th and the XVIII Airborne Corps joined in on the 6th, both pushing generally northward. German resistance, initially rather determined, dwindled rapidly. By 13 April, the 9th Army had cleared the northern part of the pocket, while elements of the XVIII Airborne Corps\u2032 [[8th Infantry Division (United States)|8th Infantry Division]] reached the southern bank of the Ruhr, splitting the southern section of the pocket in two. Thousands of prisoners were being taken every day; from 16\u201318 April, when all opposition ended and the remnants of German ''Army Group B'' formally surrendered, German troops had been surrendering in droves throughout the region. Army Group B commander Model committed suicide on 21 April.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=23}}\n\nThe final tally of prisoners taken in the Ruhr reached 325,000, far beyond anything the Americans had anticipated. Tactical commanders hastily enclosed huge open fields with barbed wire creating makeshift prisoner of war camps, where the inmates awaited the end of the war and their chance to return home. Also looking forward to going home, tens of thousands of freed forced laborers and Allied prisoners of war further strained the American logistical system.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=23}}\n\n=== U.S. 12th Army Group prepares its final thrust ===\nMeanwhile, the remaining Allied forces north, south, and east of the Ruhr had been adjusting their lines in preparation for the final advance through Germany. Under the new concept, Bradley's 12th U.S. Army Group would make the main effort, with Hodges' 1st Army in the center heading east for about {{convert|130|mi|km|abbr=on}} toward the city of Leipzig and the [[Elbe]] River. To the north, the 9th Army's XIX and XIII Corps would also drive for the Elbe, toward [[Magdeburg]], about {{convert|65|mi|km|abbr=on}} north of Leipzig, although the army commander, General Simpson, hoped he would be allowed to go all the way to Berlin. To the south, Patton's 3rd Army was to drive east to [[Chemnitz]], about {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} southeast of Leipzig, but well short of the Elbe, and then turn southeast into [[Austria]]. At the same time, General Devers' 6th U.S. Army Group would move south through [[Bavaria]] and the [[Black Forest]] to Austria and the [[Alps]], ending the threat of any Nazi last-ditch stand there.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|pp=23,26}}\n\nOn 4 April, as it paused to allow the rest of the 12th U.S. Army Group to catch up, the 3rd Army made two notable discoveries. Near the town of Merkers, elements of the 90th Infantry Division found a sealed salt mine containing a large portion of the German national treasure. The hoard included vast quantities of German paper currency, stacks of priceless paintings, piles of looted gold and silver jewelry and household objects, and an estimated $250,000,000 worth of gold bars and coins of various nations. But the other discovery made by the 3rd Army on 4 April horrified and angered those who saw it. When the 4th Armored Division and elements of the 89th Infantry Division captured the small town of [[Ohrdruf]], a few miles south of [[Gotha (town)|Gotha]], they found the [[Ohrdruf concentration camp|first concentration camp]] taken by the Western Allies.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=26}}\n\n=== U.S. 12th Army Group advances to the Elbe (9 April) ===\nThe 4 April pause in the 3rd Army advance allowed the other armies under Bradley's command to reach the [[Leine]] River, about {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of Paderborn. Thus all three armies of the 12th U.S. Army Group were in a fairly even north-south line, enabling them to advance abreast of each other to the Elbe. By 9 April, both the 9th and 1st Armies had seized bridgeheads over the Leine, prompting Bradley to order an unrestricted eastward advance. On the morning of 10 April, the 12th U.S. Army Group's drive to the Elbe began in earnest.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=26}}\n\nThe Elbe River was the official eastward objective, but many American commanders still eyed Berlin. By the evening of 11 April, elements of the 9th Army's 2nd Armored Division\u2014seemingly intent on demonstrating how easily their army could take that coveted prize\u2014had dashed {{convert|73|mi|km|abbr=on}} to reach the Elbe southeast of Magdeburg, just {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} short of the German capital. On 12 April, additional 9th Army elements attained the Elbe and by the next day were on the opposite bank hopefully awaiting permission to drive on to Berlin. But two days later, on 15 April, they had to abandon these hopes. Eisenhower sent Bradley his final word on the matter: the 9th Army was to stay put\u2014there would be no effort to take Berlin. Simpson subsequently turned his troops' attention to mopping up pockets of local resistance.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=26}}\n[[File:Coburg1945.jpg|thumb|left|American tanks in Coburg on 25 April]]\n\nIn the center of the 12th U.S. Army Group, Hodges\u2032 1st Army faced somewhat stiffer opposition, though it hardly slowed the pace. As its forces approached Leipzig, about {{convert|60|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of Magdeburg and {{convert|15|mi|km|abbr=on}} short of the [[Mulde River]], the 1st Army ran into one of the few remaining centers of organized resistance. Here the Germans turned a thick defense belt of antiaircraft guns against the American ground troops with devastating effects. Through a combination of flanking movements and night attacks, First Army troops were able to destroy or bypass the guns, moving finally into Leipzig, which formally surrendered on the morning of 20 April. By the end of the day, the units that had taken Leipzig joined the rest of the 1st Army on the [[Mulde]], where it had been ordered to halt.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=27}}\n\nMeanwhile, on the 12th U.S. Army Group's southern flank, the 3rd Army had advanced apace, moving {{convert|30|mi|km|abbr=on}} eastward to take [[Erfurt]] and [[Weimar]], and then, by 12 April, another {{convert|30|mi|km|abbr=on}} through the old 1806 [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt|Jena Napoleonic battlefield]] area. On that day, Eisenhower instructed Patton to halt the 3rd Army at the Mulde River, about {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} short of its original objective, Chemnitz. The change resulted from an agreement between the American and Soviet military leadership based on the need to establish a readily identifiable geographical line to avoid accidental clashes between the converging Allied forces. However, as the 3rd Army began pulling up to the Mulde on 13 April, the XII Corps\u2014Patton's southernmost force\u2014continued moving southeast alongside the 6th U.S. Army Group to clear southern Germany and move into Austria. After taking [[Coburg]], about {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of Erfurt, on 11 April, XII Corps troops captured [[Bayreuth]], {{convert|35|mi|km|abbr=on}} farther southeast, on 14 April.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=30}}\n\nAs was the case throughout the campaign, the German ability to fight was sporadic and unpredictable during the drive to the [[Elbe\u2013Mulde line]]. Some areas were stoutly defended while in others the enemy surrendered after little more than token resistance. By sending armored spearheads around hotly contested areas, isolating them for reduction by subsequent waves of infantry, Eisenhower's forces maintained their eastward momentum. A German holdout force of 70,000 in the [[Harz]] Mountains\u2014{{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} north of Erfurt\u2014was neutralized in this way, as were the towns of Erfurt, [[Jena]], and Leipzig.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=30}}\n\n=== U.S. First Army makes first contact with the advancing Soviets (25 April) ===\n[[File:Final Operations - 19 April-7 Mai 1945.jpg|300px|thumb|The final operations of the Western Allied armies between 19 April and 7 May 1945 and the change in the Soviet front line over this period]]\n\nEvery unit along the Elbe\u2013Mulde line was anxious to be the first to meet the Red Army. By the last week of April, it was well known that the Soviets were close, and dozens of American patrols were probing beyond the east bank of the Mulde, hoping to meet them. Elements of the 1st Army's V Corps made first contact. At 11:30 on 25 April, a small patrol from the [[69th Infantry Division (United States)|69th Infantry Division]] met a lone Soviet horseman in the village of [[N\u00fcnchritz|Leckwitz]]. Several other patrols from the 69th had similar encounters later that day, and on 26 April the division commander, Maj. Gen. [[Emil F. Reinhardt]], met Maj. Gen. Vladimir Rusakov of the Russian 58th Guards Infantry Division at [[Torgau]] in the first official link-up ceremony.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=30}}\n<!-- Vladimir Rusakov needs a separate link on the disambugation page as only the Mexican painter is currently listed. -->\n\n25 April is known as [[Elbe Day]].\n\n=== U.S. 6th Army Group heads for Austria ===\nWhile the 12th U.S. Army Group made its eastward thrust, Devers\u2032 6th U.S. Army Group to the south had the dual mission of protecting the 12th U.S. Army Group's right flank and eliminating any German attempt to make a last stand in the Alps of southern Germany and western Austria. To accomplish both objectives, Patch's 7th Army on Devers\u2032 left was to make a great arc, first driving northeastward alongside Bradley's flank, then turning south with the 3rd Army to take [[Nuremberg]] and [[Munich]], ultimately continuing into Austria. The French 1st Army, under de Lattre de Tassigny, was to attack to the south and southeast, taking [[Stuttgart]] before moving to the Swiss border and into Austria.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=31}}\n\nInitially, the opposition in the 6th U.S. Army Group's sector was stiffer than that facing the 12th U.S. Army Group. The German forces there were simply in less disarray than those to the north. Nevertheless, the 7th Army broke out of its Rhine bridgehead, just south of [[Frankfurt]], on 28 March, employing elements of three corps\u2014the [[XV Corps (United States)|XV Corps]] to the north, the [[XXI Corps (United States)|XXI Corps]] in the center, and the [[VI Corps (United States)|VI Corps]] to the south. The XV Corps\u2032 [[45th Infantry Division (United States)|45th Infantry Division]] fought for six days before taking the city of [[Aschaffenburg]], {{convert|35|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of the Rhine, on 3 April. To the south, elements of the VI Corps met unexpectedly fierce resistance at [[Battle of Heilbronn (1945)|Heilbronn]], {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} into the German rear. Despite a wide armored thrust to envelop the enemy defenses, it took nine days of intense fighting to bring Heilbronn fully under American control. Still, by 11 April 7th Army had penetrated the German defenses in depth, especially in the north, and was ready to begin its wheeling movement southeast and south. Thus, on 15 April when Eisenhower ordered Patton's entire 3rd Army to drive southeast down the [[Danube]] River valley to [[Linz]], and south to [[Salzburg]] and central Austria, he also instructed the 6th U.S. Army Group to make a similar turn into southern Germany and western Austria.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|pp=31\u201332}}\n[[File:3.

In a double envelopment, the French captured Stuttgart on 21 April, and by the next day both the French and the VI Corps had elements on the Danube. Similarly, the 3rd Army on the 6th U.S. Army Group's left flank had advanced rapidly against very little resistance, its lead elements reaching the river on 24 April.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=32}}\n\nAs the 6th U.S. Army Group and the 3rd Army finished clearing southern Germany and approached Austria, it was clear to most observers, Allied and German alike, that the war was nearly over.

On 29 April, the British made an assault crossing of the Elbe, supported on the following day by the recently reattached XVIII Airborne Corps. The bridgehead expanded rapidly, and by 2 May Lubeck and Wismar, {{convert|40|-|50|mi|km}} beyond the river, were in Allied hands, sealing off the Germans in the Jutland Peninsula.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=33}}\n\nOn the 21st Army Group's left, one corps of the Canadian 1st Army reached the North Sea near the Dutch\u2013German border on 16 April, while another drove through the central Netherlands, trapping the German forces remaining in that country.

After attempting to strike a deal whereby he would surrender only to the Western Allies, a proposal that was summarily rejected on 7 May, D\u00f6nitz granted his representative, [[Alfred Jodl]], permission to effect a complete surrender on all fronts. The appropriate documents were signed on the same day and became effective on 8 May. Despite scattered resistance from a few isolated units, the war in Europe was over.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=34}}\n\n== Analysis ==\n[[File:U.S Airfields in Europa as of 8 May 1945.jpg|right|thumb|U.S. Airfields in Europe as of 8 May 1945]]\n\nBy the beginning of the Central Europe campaign, Allied victory in Europe was inevitable. Having gambled his future ability to defend Germany on the Ardennes offensive and lost, Hitler had no real strength left to stop the powerful Allied armies. The Western Allies still had to fight, often bitterly, for victory. Even when the hopelessness of the German situation became obvious to his most loyal subordinates, Hitler refused to admit defeat. Only when Soviet artillery was falling around his Berlin headquarters bunker did he begin to perceive the final outcome.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=34}}\n\nThe crossing of the Rhine, the encirclement and reduction of the Ruhr, and the sweep to the Elbe\u2013Mulde line and the Alps all established the final campaign on the Western Front as a showcase for Allied superiority in maneuver warfare. Drawing on the experience gained during the campaign in Normandy and the [[Allied advance from Paris to the Rhine]], the Western Allies demonstrated in Central Europe their capability of absorbing the lessons of the past. By attaching [[mechanized infantry]] units to armored divisions, they created a hybrid of strength and mobility that served them well in the pursuit warfare through Germany. Key to the effort was the logistical support that kept these forces fueled, and the determination to maintain the forward momentum at all costs. These mobile forces made great thrusts to isolate pockets of German troops, which were mopped up by additional infantry following close behind. The Allies rapidly eroded any remaining ability to resist.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|pp=34\u201335}}\n\nFor their part, captured German soldiers often claimed to be most impressed not by American armor or infantry but by the artillery. They frequently remarked on its accuracy and the swiftness of its target acquisition\u2014and especially the prodigious amount of artillery ammunition expended.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=35}}\n\nIn retrospect, very few questionable decisions were made concerning the execution of the campaign. For example, Patton potentially could have made his initial Rhine crossing north of Mainz and avoided the losses incurred crossing the Main. Further north the airborne landings during Operation Plunder in support of the 21st Army Group's crossing of the Rhine were probably not worth the risk. But because of the decisive efforts plotted by Patton was turned down, the losses couldn't be averted and by far can say the Allied victory was postponed up to an extent of a month.{{sfn|Bedessem|1996|p=35}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe food situation in occupied Germany was initially very dire. By the spring of 1946 the official ration in the American zone was no more than {{convert|1275|Cal|kJ}} per day, with some areas probably receiving as little as {{convert|700|Cal|kJ}} per day. In the British zone the food situation was dire, as found during a visit by the British publisher [[Victor Gollancz]] in October and November 1946. In [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] the normal 28-day allocation should have been {{convert|1548|Cal|kJ}} including {{convert|10|kg}} of bread, but as there was limited grain the bread ration was only {{convert|8.5|kg}}. However, as there was only sufficient bread for about 50% of this \"called up\" ration, the total deficiency was about 50%, not 15% as stated in a ministerial reply in the British Parliament on 11 December. So only about {{convert|770|Cal|kJ}} would have been supplied, and he said the German winter ration would be {{convert|1000|Cal|kJ}} as the recent increase was \"largely mythical\". His book includes photos taken on the visit and critical letters and newspaper articles by him published in several British newspapers; ''The Times, the Daily Herald, the Manchester Guardian'', etc.<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Victor Gollancz|Gollancz, Victor]] |title= In Darkest Germany|year=1947 |publisher=Victor Gollancz, London|pages=116, 125\u20136 |quote= | url= |isbn= }}</ref>\n\nDuring and immediately following the invasion, vengeful US troops  engaged in mass rape.<ref>{{cite magazine |last= Wiegrefe|first= Klaus|date= 2 March 2015|title= Were Americans As Bad as the Soviets?|url= https://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/book-claims-us-soldiers-raped-190-000-german-women-post-wwii-a-1021298.html |magazine= Der Spiegel|location= Hamburg|publisher= Spiegel-Verlag|access-date= 28 December 2019}}</ref> Some occupation soldiers took advantage of the desperate food situation by exploiting their ample supply of food and cigarettes (the currency of the black market) to get to the local German girls as what became known as ''frau bait'' (''[[The New York Times]]'', 25 June 1945).

Saudi forces deployed in the region were limited to some tribal militias, backed by some aircraft and artillery. A small section of the PRSY force began advancing on [[Sharurah]], but was halted.\n\nHaving been informed of the PRSY advance, [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|King Faisal]] ordered [[Sultan bin Abdulaziz]], the Minister of Defense and Aviation, to expel PRSY forces. Sultan commissioned all units in the southern region for the task of attempting to reoccupy al-Wadiah within two days.  \n{{Location map many | Saudi Arabia\n| relief   = yes\n| width    = 300\n| caption  = Location of al-Wadiah on the South Yemeni-Saudi Arabian border\n\n| lat1_deg = 17.310\n| lon1_deg = 47.095\n| pos1 = top\n| label1   = al-Wadiah\n}}\n\n==Saudi counterattack==\n\n===The first phase (air strikes)===\nThe initial part of the conflict was largely limited to aerial battles, with a series of air clashes taking place in late November and early December.<ref name=\"Dictionary\"/>  During this initial period Iraq and Jordan attempted to mediate an end to the conflict.<ref name=\"Dictionary\"/>\n\nThe Royal Saudi Air Force also conducted a series of aerial bombardments. These attacks continued over the course of two days, initially being directed at PRSY Army forces in the region, and later specifically at the PRSY leadership, whilst also attacking PRSY logistics.\n\n===The second phase (ground attack)===\nAt 0945 in the morning, the Saudi ground offensive began advancing on Yemeni positions on two axes: A battalion of Saudi National Guard units, along with some other forces, advanced on Yemeni positions from the West. A second group, composed of exiled Yemenis and Saudi border guards, advanced on Yemeni positions from the east.\n\nDuring the attack PRSY forces were divided into two pockets. A PRSY counterattack failed to unite the pockets. The following day clashes began at dawn, and continued throughout the day. The commander of the PRSY Brigade was killed in the fighting, following which PRSY forces began to withdraw. Saudi forces harassed PRSY forces during the retreat, although stopped at the border under orders.\n\n===The third phase (reinforcement)===\nSaudi forces then proceeded to take up defensive positions within al-Wadiah. Some abandoned PRSY equipment was seized.\n\nThe Saudis claimed to have occupied al-Wadiah by 5 December, and took journalists to the town. Saudi forces claimed to have killed 35 soldiers from the PRSY, and also claimed that they could have marched on Aden, the PRSY capital, had they not been ordered to stop at the border by King Faisal.<ref name=\"Dictionary\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nFollowing the conflict the Saudi government began a large scale program of construction of military sites in the region, whilst also deploying further military forces to [[Sharurah]], close to al-Wadiah.<ref name=\"R&FP\"/> Tensions continued, especially after the 1972 Tripoli Agreement, under which North and South Yemen agreed to merge, due to Saudi hostility to any merger. In March 1973 Saudi Arabia claimed that two PRSY MiGs had attacked al-Wadiah, although the PRSY denied any such incident, and claimed Saudi Arabia was searching for a pretext for military intervention in South Yemen.<ref name=\"Dictionary\"/> There was a brief warming of relations between the two countries in November 1977, although this soon lapsed and ambassadors were recalled by both countries.<ref name=\"Dictionary\"/> There were further reports of clashes in January 1978, including the shooting down of 4 RSAF [[English Electric Lightning|Lightning]]s by a PRSY MiG, although this was denied.

The project consists of the construction and operation of eight [[run-of-river]] [[hydropower plant]]s providing total capacity of 35.4 GW, which will generate an average of 224 GWh/year. The project is located in Dang Town, Subei Mongolian Autonomous County, [[Gansu Province]], China, and was certified by the [[National Development and Reform Commission]] (NDRC) to be in compliance with the \"Measures for the Operation and Management of Clean Development Mechanism Projects in China\". The power generated by the project will be sold to the Gansu power grid which is part of the China Northwest Regional Power Grid (NWPG). This will displace equivalent amounts of electricity generated by the current mix of power sold to the NWPG. The developer of the Gansu Dang River Hydropower Project, which started construction on 1 November 2004, is the Jiayuguan City Tongyuan Hydropower Co., Ltd.

Despite this level of production, experts say that there will be no threat to food security, though there will be an increasing number of farmers who will be \"farming oil\" if the price of [[crude oil]] continues to increase. Based on planned ethanol projects in some provinces in China, the output of corn would be insufficient to provide the raw material for  plants in these provinces.

Recognizing geothermal energy as an alternative and renewable energy resource since the 1970s, China has conducted extensive explorations aiming at identifying high temperature resources for electric generation. Until 2006, 181 geothemal systems had been found on mainland China, with an estimated generation potential of 1,740&nbsp;MW.

Related issues are supervised by multiple organizations such as the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), Ministry of Commerce, State electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC) and so forth. In 2008, the National Energy Administration was founded under the NDRC, however its work has been proven inefficient.<ref name=\"AutoJV-27\"/> In January 2010, the State Council decided to set up a National Energy Commission (NEC), headed by current Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao. The commission will be responsible for drafting a national energy development plan, reviewing energy security and major energy issues and coordinating domestic energy development and international cooperation.<ref name=\"AutoJV-28\"/>\n\nThe Chinese government is implementing multiple policies to promote renewable energy. From 2008 to January 2012, China held the top spot in clean energy investment.<ref name=\"AutoJV-29\"/>  The Renewable Energy Law passed in 2005 explicitly states in its first chapter that the development and the usage of renewable energy is a prioritized area in energy development.<ref name=\"AutoJV-30\"/> The [[Twelfth Five-Year Plan (People's Republic of China)|Twelfth Five-Year Plan]], the current plan, also places great emphasis on green energy.<ref name=\"AutoJV-31\"/> Detailed incentive policies and programs include the Golden Sun program, which provides financial subsidies, technology support and market incentives to facilitate the development of the solar power industry;<ref name=\"AutoJV-32\"/> the Suggestions on Promoting Wind Electricity Industry in 2006, which offers preferential policies for wind power development;<ref name=\"AutoJV-33\"/> and many other policies. Besides promoting policies, China has enacted a number of policies to standardize renewable energy products, to prevent environmental damage, and to regulate the price of green energy. These policies include, but are not limited to Renewable Energy Law,<ref name=\"AutoJV-34\"/> the Safety Regulations of Hydropower Dams<ref name=\"AutoJV-35\"/> and the National Standard of Solar Water Heaters.<ref name=\"AutoJV-36\"/>\n\nSeveral provisions in relevant Chinese laws and regulations address the development of [[methane gas]] in rural China. These provisions include Article 54 of the Agriculture Law of the People's Republic of China,<ref name=\"AutoJV-37\"/> Articles 4 and 11 of the [[Energy Conservation]] Law of the People's Republic of China,<ref name=\"AutoJV-38\"/> Article 18 of the Renewable Energy Law of the People's Republic of China<ref name=\"AutoJV-39\"/> and Article 12 of the Regulations of the People's Republic of China Concerning Restoring [[arable land|Farmland]] to [[Forest]].<ref name=\"AutoJV-40\"/>\n\nOn 20 April 2007, the Environment and Resources Committee of the [[National People's Congress]] and the [[National Development and Reform Commission]] convened a conference on the occasion of the first anniversary of the ''Renewable Energy Law''. There were approximately 250 people who attended the conference from the [[Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Finance]], the [[Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Science and Technology]], the [[Ministry of Agriculture]], the [[Ministry of Construction of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Construction]], the [[General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine]] (AQSIQ), the National Bureau of Forestry, the National Power Network Company, science and technology institutes, oil companies, large energy investment companies, companies manufacturing renewable energy equipment, etc. Other conferences  included the 3rd Annual China Power & Alternative Energy Summit, held from 16\u201320 May 2007, at the Swissotel, Beijing; the 2nd China Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Products and Technology Exhibition, held from 1\u20133 June 2007, in Beijing at the National Agricultural Exhibition Hall; and the 2007 China International Solar Energy and Photovoltaic Engineering Exhibition, held at the Beijing International Exhibition Center from 25\u201329 June 2007. The sponsors of the exhibition included the [[Asia Renewable Energy Association]], the [[China Energy Enterprises Management Association]] and the [[China Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Enterprise Association]].\n\n== ''Clean Development Mechanism'' projects in China ==\n{{Further information|Clean Development Mechanism}}\n\nAccording to the UNFCCC database, by November 2011, China was the leading host nation for CDM projects with 1661 projects (46.32%) of a total of 3586 registered project activities (100%).<ref name=\"AutoJV-41\"/> According to the IGES (Japan), the running total of CERs generated by CDM projects in China at 31 March 2011 was topped by HFC reduction/avoidance projects (365,577 x 1000t/CO2-e) followed by hydro power (227,693), wind power (149,492), N2O decomposition (102,798), and methane recovery (102,067).<ref name=\"AutoJV-42\"/>\n\nAccording to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]], of a total of more than 600 registered CDM Projects worldwide through mid-April 2007, there are now 70 registered CDM projects in China. The pace of Chinese CDM project registration is accelerating; prior to the beginning of 2007 China had 34 registered CDM projects, yet to date in 2007 another 36 Chinese CDM projects have been registered.<ref name=\"AutoJV-43\"/>\n\nThe Shanghai Power Transmission and Distribution Joint Stock Company, a subsidiary of the Shanghai Electric and Gas Group Joint Stock Company entered into a joint venture agreement with Canada's Xantrex Technology, Inc, to build a factory to design, manufacture and sell solar and wind power electric and gas electronics products. The new company is in the final stages of the approval process.<ref name=\"AutoJV-44\"/>\n\nAccording to Theo Ramborst, the General Manager and CEO of [[Bosch Rexroth]] (China) Ltd., a subsidiary of the [[Bosch Group|Bosch Group AG]], a world leader in controls, transmission and machine [[hydraulics]] manufacturing, Bosch Rexroth (China) Ltd. contracted \u20ac120 million in wind turbo generator business in China in 2006, a 66% increase year-on-year. Responding to the increase in wind energy business in China, Bosch Rexroth (China) Ltd. invested {{\u00a5|280 million}} in October 2006 in plant expansions in [[Beijing]] and [[Changzhou]], Jiangsu Province. Earlier in 2006 Bosch Rexroth started up its Shanghai Jinqiao (Golden Bridge) factory, which is involved in the manufacture, installation, distribution and service of transmission and control parts and systems; the Shanghai facility will also serve as Bosch's principal center for technology, personnel and distribution in China.<ref name=\"AutoJV-45\"/>\n\n== Environmental protection and energy conservation ==\nAccording to China's \"Energy Blue Paper\" recently written by the [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]], the average rate of recovery of [[coal]] from [[coal mining|mining]] in China is only 30%, less than one-half the rate of recovery throughout the world; the rate of recovery of coal resources in the US, [[Australia]], [[Germany]] and [[Canada]] is ~80%.  The rate of recovery of coal from mining in [[Shanxi Province]], China's largest source of coal is approximately 40%, though the rate of recovery of village and township coal mines in Shanxi Province is only 10%-20%.  Cumulatively over the course of the past 20 years (1980\u20132000) China has wasted upwards of 28 gigatons of coal.<ref name=\"AutoJV-46\"/> The same causes for a low rate of recovery in coal mining \u2014 that extraction methods are backward \u2014 lead to safety problems in China's [[coal mining]] sector.  Another reason for the low rate of recovery is that the majority of extraction comes from small-scale mining; of the 346.9 gigatons of coal extracted by China, only 98 gigatons has come from large or mid-sized mines while 250 gigatons are extracted from small mines.  Based on coal production in 2005 of 2.19 gigatons and a current rate of recovery of 30%, if China were able to double its rate of recovery it would save approximately 3.5 gigatons of coal.<ref name=\"AutoJV-47\"/>\n\nOn 13 April 2007, the Department of Science, Technology and Education of the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture hosted the Asian regional workshop on [[adaptation to climate change]] organized by the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC). Climate change will affect [[Asian countries]] in different but consistently negative ways.  [[Temperate region]]s will experience changes in [[boreal forest]] cover, while vanishing [[mountain glacier]]s will cause problems such as [[water]] shortages and increased risks of [[glacial lake]] [[flooding]].  Coastal zones are under increasing risk from [[sea level]] rises as well as [[pollution]] and [[overexploitation]] of [[natural resources]].  In 2006 in China storms, floods, heat and drought killed more than 2,700 people; effects ranged from drought in the southwest of China, which were the worst since records began to be kept in the late nineteenth century, to [[floods]] and [[typhoons]] in central and southeastern China.  The weather events in China in 2006 were seen to be a prelude to weather patterns likely to become more common due to [[global warming]].  Topics discussed by representatives of Asian countries and developed countries, international organizations and nongovernmental organizations, included vulnerability assessments, implementing adaptation actions in various sectors of the economy and in specific geographical areas, such as coastal and mountainous regions.<ref name=\"AutoJV-48\"/>\n\nBased on a recently completed survey in 2007, the [[Standardization Administration of China]] plans to further develop and improve standards for conservation and comprehensive utilization of natural resources in the following areas: energy, water, wood and land conservation, development of renewable energy, the comprehensive utilization of mineral resources, recovery, [[recycling]] and reuse of scrap materials and clean production.<ref name=\"AutoJV-49\"/>\n\n== Energy production and consumption ==\nIn 2011, China produced 70% of its energy from coal, emitted more carbon dioxide than the next two largest emitters combined (United States and India) and emissions had been increasing by 10% a year.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/12/greenhouse-gases-make-hig_n_3066775.html | title=China's Carbon Emissions Directly Linked to Rise In Daily Temperature Spikes, Study Finds| first= Seth| last=Borenstein| date= 12 April 2013| access-date= 15 May 2013| publisher=The Huffingtion Post| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306093103/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/12/greenhouse-gases-make-hig_n_3066775.html| archive-date=6 March 2016| url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, China produced 6% of its energy from hydroelectric, <1% from nuclear, and 1% from other renewable energy sources.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/countries/cab.cfm?fips=CH|title=China - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nChinese energy experts estimate that by 2050 the share of electricity from coal will decline to 30%-50%, and that the remaining 50%-70% will come from a combination of [[oil]], [[natural gas]], and [[renewable energy]] sources, including [[hydropower]], [[nuclear power]], [[biomass]], solar energy, wind energy, and other renewable energy sources.<ref name=\"AutoJV-50\"/>\n\nIn 2007, transportation's share of crude oil consumption in China was approximately 35%, but by 2020 crude oil consumption for transportation will increase to 50% of total crude oil consumption.<ref name=\"AutoJV-56\" />\n\nAccording to a study by the Energy Research Institute of the [[National Development and Reform Commission]] on the economic circumstances of China's [[crude oil]] and [[chemical industry]] as of 2007, in recent years China has wasted an average of 400 megatons of coal equivalents per year. In 2006, China consumed 2.46 gigatons coal equivalents, up from 1.4 in 2000. With energy consumption increasing by 10% per year, in the last 5 years total energy consumption exceeded the combined consumption over the previous 20 years. According to Dai Yande, the chairman of the Energy Research Institute of the NDRC, while continued high consumption of energy is unavoidable, China must take steps to change the form of its [[economic growth]] and increase substantially the [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] of industry and society. Among other things, China should find new points of [[economic development]] that move it away from being the \"World's Factory\" and improves energy efficiency. It also must avoid unnecessary waste, foster a sustainable economy and encourage renewable energy to reduce its reliance on [[petrochemical]] energy resources.<ref name=\"AutoJV-52\" />\n\nSince June 2006 when Chinese Premier [[Wen Jiabao]] visited the [[Shenhua Group]]'s [[coal liquefaction]] project and expressed that coal-to-liquids production was one important part of China's [[energy security]], there have been many new \u2018coal to oil' projects announced by many large coal producing provinces and cities. As of the end of 2006, 88 [[methyl alcohol]] projects were planned; their total was 48.5 megatons/year. If all of these projects are built, by 2010 output of methyl alcohol will reach 60 megatons/year. This development rush to build coal to oil projects prompted concerns about a new round of wasteful development and the [[unintended consequence]]s of such rapid development; these include wasteful extraction of coal, excessive water use (this process requires 10 tons of water for every ton of oil produced), and likely increases in the price of coal.<ref name=\"AutoJV-51\" />\n\nChina and [[Russia]] are in talks to link their electric power networks so that China can buy power from the [[Russian Far East]] to supply [[Northeast China]] ([[Dongbei]]). The benefits for China of importing power from neighboring countries include conserving domestic resources, lowering energy consumption, lessening China's dependence on imported oil (80%-90% of which must be shipped through unsafe waters) and reducing pollution discharge. China already has begun to build a 1 MV [[High voltage|high-tension demonstration project]] and an 800 kV direct power transmission project; after 2010 China will have a long-distance high-tension, high-capacity line for international transmission. China also is considering connecting its power transmission lines with [[Mongolia]] and several [[former Soviet states]] that border China; specialists predict that by the year 2020 more than 4 PWh of power will be transmitted to China from neighboring states. In that year China is expected to produce 250 megatons of crude oil and be required to import approximately 350 megatons of crude oil, a reliance on exports of 60%. If China is able to import 620 TWh of power from neighbors, it will be able to reduce crude oil imports by 100 megatons. By importing electricity China will not only reduce its dependence on imported crude oil, but also will enhance energy security by diversifying its foreign energy sources, making China less vulnerable to disruptions in supply.<ref name=\"AutoJV-55\" />\n\nIn 2006 a total of 2.8344 PWh of electricity was generated in China from an installed base of 622 GW of power generating capacity; in 2006 alone an additional 105 GW of installed capacity came on line in China.<ref name=\"AutoJV-53\" /> Experts estimate that another 100 GW of newly installed [[electric power]] generating capacity will again come on-line in 2007, but that 2006 probably was the high-water mark for electric power capacity development in China.<ref name=\"AutoJV-54\" />\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Renewable energy|China}}\n'''China'''\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Wind power in China]]\n* [[Solar power in China]]\n* [[Geothermal power in China]]\n* [[Bioenergy in China]]\n* [[List of power stations in China]]\n* [[List of offshore wind farms in China]]\n* [[Automotive industry in China]]\n* [[Climate change in China]]\n* [[Electric vehicle industry in China]]\n* [[Energy policy of China]]\n* [[Pollution in China]]\n* [[Three Gorges Dam]]\n\n{{Div col end}}\n'''Global'''\n{{Div col|colwidth=27em}}\n* [[Renewable energy in Asia]]\n* [[International Renewable Energy Agency]] (IRENA)\n* [[World energy resources and consumption]]\n* [[Renewable energy commercialization]]\n* [[REN21|The Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century(REN21)]]\n* [[Hydrogen economy]]\n* [[Global warming]]\n* [[Greenhouse effect]]\n* [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]]\n* [[Renewable energy legislation and incentives]]\n* [[Sustainable energy]]\n* [[Renewable energy by country]]{{Div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<!--ref name=\"AutoJV-1\">[http://www.chinaenvironment.net/pace/more.php?id=453_0_5_0 PACE 2007- International Forum on Development in China]</ref-->\n<!--ref name=worldwatch>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5491|title=Powering China's Development: The Role of Renewable Energy|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2014}}</ref-->\n<ref name=\"ecosensorium.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ecosensorium.org/2010/11/china-tops-world-in-clean-energy.html|title=China tops the world in clean energy production|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2014}}</ref>\n<!--ref name=\"AutoJV-2\">[http://eprints.ucl.ac.uk/16051/1/16051.pdf Caprotti F (2009) China's Cleantech Landscape: The Renewable Energy Technology Paradox ''Sustainable Development Law & Policy '' Spring 2009: 6-10]</ref-->\n<!--ref name=\"AutoJV-3\">[http://ecogeek.org/wind-power/2948-china-could-replace-coal-with-wind China Could Replace Coal with Wind]</ref-->\n<!--ref name=\"AutoJV-4\">[http://www.electroiq.com/photovoltaics/2012/03/12/china-to-drop-solar-energy-to-focus-on-nuclear-power.html China to Drop Solar Energy to Focus on Nuclear Power]</ref-->\n<!--ref name=\"AutoJV-5\">[http://www.hydroworld.com/index/display/news_display.1311386642.html China hydro capacity to reach 210 GW by year-end - official]</ref-->\n<ref name=\"AutoJV-6\">[http://cdm.ccchina.gov.cn/english/NewsInfo.asp?NewsId=982 Approval status of CDM projects in China(up to 16 June 2006)]</ref>\n<ref name=\"AutoJV-7\">[http://www.ccchina.gov.cn/WebSite/CCChina/UpFile/File188.pdf China's National Climate Change Programme, 2007-06-04]</ref>\n<ref name=\"AutoJV-8\">{{cite web|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/english/200005/24/eng20000524_41520.html|title=China To Launch Massive Hydropower Construction in 21st Century|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2014}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"AutoJV-9\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=chinas-big-push-for-renewable-energy|title=China's Big Push for Renewable Energy: Scientific American|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2014}}</ref>\n<ref name=renew>{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/story?id=52764|title=China's Wind Power Industry: Blowing Past Expectations|work=Renewable Energy World|accessdate=10 October 2014}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"AutoJV-10\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/feb/03/wind-power-eu|title=Wind power becomes Europe's fastest growing energy source|work=the Guardian|accessdate=10 October 2014}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"AutoJV-11\">{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/31/business/energy-environment/31renew.html | work=The New York Times | title=China Leading Global Race to Make Clean Energy | first=Keith | last=Bradsher | date=30 January 2010}}</ref>\n<ref name=re>[[REN21]] (2009).

The project consists of the construction and operation of eight [[run-of-river]] [[hydropower plant]]s providing total capacity of 35.4 GW, which will generate an average of 224 GWh/year. The project is located in Dang Town, Subei Mongolian Autonomous County, [[Gansu Province]], China, and was certified by the [[National Development and Reform Commission]] (NDRC) to be in compliance with the \"Measures for the Operation and Management of Clean Development Mechanism Projects in China\". The power generated by the project will be sold to the Gansu power grid which is part of the China Northwest Regional Power Grid (NWPG). This will displace equivalent amounts of electricity generated by the current mix of power sold to the NWPG. The developer of the Gansu Dang River Hydropower Project, which started construction on 1 November 2004, is the Jiayuguan City Tongyuan Hydropower Co., Ltd. The Letter of Approval of the NDRC permits the Jiayuguan City Tongyuan Hydropower Co. Ltd. to transfer to Japan Carbon Finance, Ltd., an entity approved by the [[government of Japan]] no more than 1.2 megatons of carbon dioxide emissions in total [[Certified Emission Reduction]]s (CERs) over the seven-year period beginning on 1 May 2007, and ending on 30 April 2014.<ref name=\"AutoJV-7\"/>\n\nIn 2006 there were 10 GW of installed hydropower capacity that went into operation in China. The National Development and Reform Commission also approved thirteen additional hydropower projects in 2006, which cumulatively will have 19.5 GW of power generating capacity. New hydropower projects that were approved and began construction in 2006 include the [[Jinsha River]] [[Xiangjiaba Dam]] (6000&nbsp;MW), the [[Yalong River]] (Second Phase) (4800&nbsp;MW), the [[Lancang River]]'s [[Jinghong Dam]] (1750&nbsp;MW), the [[Beipan River]](1040&nbsp;MW), and the [[Wu River (Yangtze River)|Wu River's]] [[Silin Dam]] (1080&nbsp;MW).

Through all these developments, the Chinese wind industry appeared unaffected by the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132010|global financial crisis]], according to industry observers.<ref name=\"re\" />\n\nBy 2009 China had total installed windpower capacity up to 26 GW.<ref name=\"ecosensorium.org\" /> China has identified wind power as a key growth component of the country's economy.<ref name=\"AutoJV-10\" />\n\nAs of 2010, China has become the world's largest maker of wind turbines, surpassing Denmark, Germany, Spain, and the United States.<ref name=\"AutoJV-11\" /> The initial future target set by the Chinese government was 10 GW by 2010,<ref name=\"AutoJV-12\" /> but the total installed capacity for wind power generation in China had already reached 25.1 GW by the end of 2009.<ref name=\"renew\" /><ref name=\"AutoJV-13\" /> \n\nIn September, 2019, Norwegian energy firm Equinor and state-owned China Power International Holding (CPIH) announced their plan to cooperate in developing offshore wind in China and Europe.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-equinor-renewables-china-idUSKBN1WA1FA|title=Norway's Equinor to cooperate with China's CPIH in offshore wind|date=2019-09-25|work=Reuters|access-date=2019-09-25|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Solar power ===\n[[File:China Photovoltaics Installed Capacity.svg|thumb|PV capacity growth in China]]\n[[File:China GHI mid-size-map 156x152mm-300dpi v20170926.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Global Horizontal Irradiation in China. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://globalsolaratlas.info/|title=Global Solar Atlas|access-date=7 December 2018}}</ref>]]\n{{main|Solar power in China}}\n\nChina produces 63% of the world's solar [[photovoltaics]] (PV).<ref name=\"AutoJV-15\"/> It has emerged as the world's largest manufacturer as of June 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fortune.com/2015/06/18/china-is-utterly-and-totally-dominating-solar-panels |title=China is utterly and totally dominating solar panels |publisher=FORTUNE |access-date=29 October 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nFollowing the new incentive scheme of Golden Sun announced by the government in 2009, there are numerous recent developments and plans announced by industry players that became part of the milestones for solar industry and technology development in China, such as the new thin film solar plant developed by [[Anwell Technologies]] in the Henan province using its own proprietary solar technology. The agreement was signed by LDK for a 500&nbsp;MW solar project in the desert, alongside First Solar and Ordos City. The effort to drive the renewable energy use in China was further assured after the speech of the Chinese President given at the UN climate summit on 22 September 2009 in New York, pledging that China would adopt plans to use 15% of its energy from renewable sources within a decade.<ref name=\"AutoJV-16\" /><ref name=\"AutoJV-17\" /><ref name=\"AutoJV-18\" />\n\nChina has become a world leader in the manufacture of solar photovoltaic technology, with its six biggest solar companies having a combined value of over $15 billion. Around 820&nbsp;MW of solar PV were produced in China in 2007, second only to Japan.<ref name=\"2006 summary\"/>\n\n===Biomass and biofuel===\n{{main|Bioenergy in China}}\n\nChina emerged as the world's third largest producer of [[ethanol]]-based [[bio-fuel]]s (after the [[Biofuel in the United States|U.S]] and [[Energy policy of Brazil|Brazil]]) at the end of the 10th Five Year Plan Period in 2005 and at present ethanol accounts for 20% of total [[automotive]] fuel consumption in China.<ref name=\"AutoJV-21\"/> In the 11th Five Year Plan period (2006 through 2010) China planned to develop six megatons/year of fuel ethanol capacity, which is expected to grow to 15 megatons/year by 2020. Despite this level of production, experts say that there will be no threat to food security, though there will be an increasing number of farmers who will be \"farming oil\" if the price of [[crude oil]] continues to increase. Based on planned ethanol projects in some provinces in China, the output of corn would be insufficient to provide the raw material for  plants in these provinces. In the recently published ''[[World Economic Outlook]]'', the [[International Monetary Fund]] expressed concern that there would be increasing competition worldwide between bio-fuels and food consumption for agricultural products and that that competition would likely continue to result in increases in the price of crops.<ref name=\"AutoJV-22\"/>\n\nWork has begun on the {{\u00a5|250 million}} Kaiyou Green Energy Biomass (Rice Husks) Power Generating project located in the [[Suqian City]] Economic Development Zone in [[Jiangsu Province]]. The Kaiyou Green Energy Biomass Power project will generate 144 GWh/year (equivalent to 16.5 MW) and use 200 kilotonnes/year of crop waste as inputs.<ref name=\"AutoJV-23\"/>\n\nBioenergy is also used at the domestic level in China, both in [[biomass]] stoves<ref name=\"AutoJV-24\"/> and by producing [[biogas]] from animal manure.<ref name=\"AutoJV-25\"/>\n\n=== Geothermal ===\n[[File:Yangbajing.jpg|thumb|right|A 24 MW power station in [[Yangbajain Geothermal Field]] ]]\n{{main|Geothermal power in China}}\n\nGeothermal resources in China are abundant and widely distributed throughout the country. There are over 2,700 hot springs occurring at the surface, with temperatures exceeding 250&nbsp;\u00b0C. In 1990, the total flow rate of thermal water for direct uses amounted to over 9,500&nbsp;kg/s, making China the second direct user of geothermal energy in the world. Recognizing geothermal energy as an alternative and renewable energy resource since the 1970s, China has conducted extensive explorations aiming at identifying high temperature resources for electric generation. Until 2006, 181 geothemal systems had been found on mainland China, with an estimated generation potential of 1,740&nbsp;MW. However, only seven plants, with a total capacity of 32&nbsp;MW, had been constructed and were operating in 2006.<ref name=\"AutoJV-26\"/>\n\n== National laws and policies ==\n{{Further information|Energy policy of China}}\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Energy and Industry Department in 1993, China has been running without a government agency effectively managing the country's energy. Related issues are supervised by multiple organizations such as the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), Ministry of Commerce, State electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC) and so forth. In 2008, the National Energy Administration was founded under the NDRC, however its work has been proven inefficient.<ref name=\"AutoJV-27\"/> In January 2010, the State Council decided to set up a National Energy Commission (NEC), headed by current Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao. The commission will be responsible for drafting a national energy development plan, reviewing energy security and major energy issues and coordinating domestic energy development and international cooperation.<ref name=\"AutoJV-28\"/>\n\nThe Chinese government is implementing multiple policies to promote renewable energy. From 2008 to January 2012, China held the top spot in clean energy investment.<ref name=\"AutoJV-29\"/>  The Renewable Energy Law passed in 2005 explicitly states in its first chapter that the development and the usage of renewable energy is a prioritized area in energy development.<ref name=\"AutoJV-30\"/> The [[Twelfth Five-Year Plan (People's Republic of China)|Twelfth Five-Year Plan]], the current plan, also places great emphasis on green energy.<ref name=\"AutoJV-31\"/> Detailed incentive policies and programs include the Golden Sun program, which provides financial subsidies, technology support and market incentives to facilitate the development of the solar power industry;<ref name=\"AutoJV-32\"/> the Suggestions on Promoting Wind Electricity Industry in 2006, which offers preferential policies for wind power development;<ref name=\"AutoJV-33\"/> and many other policies. Besides promoting policies, China has enacted a number of policies to standardize renewable energy products, to prevent environmental damage, and to regulate the price of green energy. These policies include, but are not limited to Renewable Energy Law,<ref name=\"AutoJV-34\"/> the Safety Regulations of Hydropower Dams<ref name=\"AutoJV-35\"/> and the National Standard of Solar Water Heaters.<ref name=\"AutoJV-36\"/>\n\nSeveral provisions in relevant Chinese laws and regulations address the development of [[methane gas]] in rural China. These provisions include Article 54 of the Agriculture Law of the People's Republic of China,<ref name=\"AutoJV-37\"/> Articles 4 and 11 of the [[Energy Conservation]] Law of the People's Republic of China,<ref name=\"AutoJV-38\"/> Article 18 of the Renewable Energy Law of the People's Republic of China<ref name=\"AutoJV-39\"/> and Article 12 of the Regulations of the People's Republic of China Concerning Restoring [[arable land|Farmland]] to [[Forest]].<ref name=\"AutoJV-40\"/>\n\nOn 20 April 2007, the Environment and Resources Committee of the [[National People's Congress]] and the [[National Development and Reform Commission]] convened a conference on the occasion of the first anniversary of the ''Renewable Energy Law''. There were approximately 250 people who attended the conference from the [[Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Finance]], the [[Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Science and Technology]], the [[Ministry of Agriculture]], the [[Ministry of Construction of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Construction]], the [[General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine]] (AQSIQ), the National Bureau of Forestry, the National Power Network Company, science and technology institutes, oil companies, large energy investment companies, companies manufacturing renewable energy equipment, etc. Other conferences  included the 3rd Annual China Power & Alternative Energy Summit, held from 16\u201320 May 2007, at the Swissotel, Beijing; the 2nd China Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Products and Technology Exhibition, held from 1\u20133 June 2007, in Beijing at the National Agricultural Exhibition Hall; and the 2007 China International Solar Energy and Photovoltaic Engineering Exhibition, held at the Beijing International Exhibition Center from 25\u201329 June 2007. The sponsors of the exhibition included the [[Asia Renewable Energy Association]], the [[China Energy Enterprises Management Association]] and the [[China Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Enterprise Association]].\n\n== ''Clean Development Mechanism'' projects in China ==\n{{Further information|Clean Development Mechanism}}\n\nAccording to the UNFCCC database, by November 2011, China was the leading host nation for CDM projects with 1661 projects (46.32%) of a total of 3586 registered project activities (100%).<ref name=\"AutoJV-41\"/> According to the IGES (Japan), the running total of CERs generated by CDM projects in China at 31 March 2011 was topped by HFC reduction/avoidance projects (365,577 x 1000t/CO2-e) followed by hydro power (227,693), wind power (149,492), N2O decomposition (102,798), and methane recovery (102,067).<ref name=\"AutoJV-42\"/>\n\nAccording to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]], of a total of more than 600 registered CDM Projects worldwide through mid-April 2007, there are now 70 registered CDM projects in China. The pace of Chinese CDM project registration is accelerating; prior to the beginning of 2007 China had 34 registered CDM projects, yet to date in 2007 another 36 Chinese CDM projects have been registered.<ref name=\"AutoJV-43\"/>\n\nThe Shanghai Power Transmission and Distribution Joint Stock Company, a subsidiary of the Shanghai Electric and Gas Group Joint Stock Company entered into a joint venture agreement with Canada's Xantrex Technology, Inc, to build a factory to design, manufacture and sell solar and wind power electric and gas electronics products. The new company is in the final stages of the approval process.<ref name=\"AutoJV-44\"/>\n\nAccording to Theo Ramborst, the General Manager and CEO of [[Bosch Rexroth]] (China) Ltd., a subsidiary of the [[Bosch Group|Bosch Group AG]], a world leader in controls, transmission and machine [[hydraulics]] manufacturing, Bosch Rexroth (China) Ltd. contracted \u20ac120 million in wind turbo generator business in China in 2006, a 66% increase year-on-year. Responding to the increase in wind energy business in China, Bosch Rexroth (China) Ltd. invested {{\u00a5|280 million}} in October 2006 in plant expansions in [[Beijing]] and [[Changzhou]], Jiangsu Province. Earlier in 2006 Bosch Rexroth started up its Shanghai Jinqiao (Golden Bridge) factory, which is involved in the manufacture, installation, distribution and service of transmission and control parts and systems; the Shanghai facility will also serve as Bosch's principal center for technology, personnel and distribution in China.<ref name=\"AutoJV-45\"/>\n\n== Environmental protection and energy conservation ==\nAccording to China's \"Energy Blue Paper\" recently written by the [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]], the average rate of recovery of [[coal]] from [[coal mining|mining]] in China is only 30%, less than one-half the rate of recovery throughout the world; the rate of recovery of coal resources in the US, [[Australia]], [[Germany]] and [[Canada]] is ~80%.  The rate of recovery of coal from mining in [[Shanxi Province]], China's largest source of coal is approximately 40%, though the rate of recovery of village and township coal mines in Shanxi Province is only 10%-20%.  Cumulatively over the course of the past 20 years (1980\u20132000) China has wasted upwards of 28 gigatons of coal.<ref name=\"AutoJV-46\"/> The same causes for a low rate of recovery in coal mining \u2014 that extraction methods are backward \u2014 lead to safety problems in China's [[coal mining]] sector.  Another reason for the low rate of recovery is that the majority of extraction comes from small-scale mining; of the 346.9 gigatons of coal extracted by China, only 98 gigatons has come from large or mid-sized mines while 250 gigatons are extracted from small mines.  Based on coal production in 2005 of 2.19 gigatons and a current rate of recovery of 30%, if China were able to double its rate of recovery it would save approximately 3.5 gigatons of coal.<ref name=\"AutoJV-47\"/>\n\nOn 13 April 2007, the Department of Science, Technology and Education of the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture hosted the Asian regional workshop on [[adaptation to climate change]] organized by the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC). Climate change will affect [[Asian countries]] in different but consistently negative ways.  [[Temperate region]]s will experience changes in [[boreal forest]] cover, while vanishing [[mountain glacier]]s will cause problems such as [[water]] shortages and increased risks of [[glacial lake]] [[flooding]].  Coastal zones are under increasing risk from [[sea level]] rises as well as [[pollution]] and [[overexploitation]] of [[natural resources]].  In 2006 in China storms, floods, heat and drought killed more than 2,700 people; effects ranged from drought in the southwest of China, which were the worst since records began to be kept in the late nineteenth century, to [[floods]] and [[typhoons]] in central and southeastern China.  The weather events in China in 2006 were seen to be a prelude to weather patterns likely to become more common due to [[global warming]].  Topics discussed by representatives of Asian countries and developed countries, international organizations and nongovernmental organizations, included vulnerability assessments, implementing adaptation actions in various sectors of the economy and in specific geographical areas, such as coastal and mountainous regions.<ref name=\"AutoJV-48\"/>\n\nBased on a recently completed survey in 2007, the [[Standardization Administration of China]] plans to further develop and improve standards for conservation and comprehensive utilization of natural resources in the following areas: energy, water, wood and land conservation, development of renewable energy, the comprehensive utilization of mineral resources, recovery, [[recycling]] and reuse of scrap materials and clean production.<ref name=\"AutoJV-49\"/>\n\n== Energy production and consumption ==\nIn 2011, China produced 70% of its energy from coal, emitted more carbon dioxide than the next two largest emitters combined (United States and India) and emissions had been increasing by 10% a year.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/12/greenhouse-gases-make-hig_n_3066775.html | title=China's Carbon Emissions Directly Linked to Rise In Daily Temperature Spikes, Study Finds| first= Seth| last=Borenstein| date= 12 April 2013| access-date= 15 May 2013| publisher=The Huffingtion Post| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306093103/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/12/greenhouse-gases-make-hig_n_3066775.html| archive-date=6 March 2016| url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, China produced 6% of its energy from hydroelectric, <1% from nuclear, and 1% from other renewable energy sources.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/countries/cab.cfm?fips=CH|title=China - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nChinese energy experts estimate that by 2050 the share of electricity from coal will decline to 30%-50%, and that the remaining 50%-70% will come from a combination of [[oil]], [[natural gas]], and [[renewable energy]] sources, including [[hydropower]], [[nuclear power]], [[biomass]], solar energy, wind energy, and other renewable energy sources.<ref name=\"AutoJV-50\"/>\n\nIn 2007, transportation's share of crude oil consumption in China was approximately 35%, but by 2020 crude oil consumption for transportation will increase to 50% of total crude oil consumption.<ref name=\"AutoJV-56\" />\n\nAccording to a study by the Energy Research Institute of the [[National Development and Reform Commission]] on the economic circumstances of China's [[crude oil]] and [[chemical industry]] as of 2007, in recent years China has wasted an average of 400 megatons of coal equivalents per year. In 2006, China consumed 2.46 gigatons coal equivalents, up from 1.4 in 2000. With energy consumption increasing by 10% per year, in the last 5 years total energy consumption exceeded the combined consumption over the previous 20 years. According to Dai Yande, the chairman of the Energy Research Institute of the NDRC, while continued high consumption of energy is unavoidable, China must take steps to change the form of its [[economic growth]] and increase substantially the [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] of industry and society. Among other things, China should find new points of [[economic development]] that move it away from being the \"World's Factory\" and improves energy efficiency. It also must avoid unnecessary waste, foster a sustainable economy and encourage renewable energy to reduce its reliance on [[petrochemical]] energy resources.<ref name=\"AutoJV-52\" />\n\nSince June 2006 when Chinese Premier [[Wen Jiabao]] visited the [[Shenhua Group]]'s [[coal liquefaction]] project and expressed that coal-to-liquids production was one important part of China's [[energy security]], there have been many new \u2018coal to oil' projects announced by many large coal producing provinces and cities. As of the end of 2006, 88 [[methyl alcohol]] projects were planned; their total was 48.5 megatons/year. If all of these projects are built, by 2010 output of methyl alcohol will reach 60 megatons/year. This development rush to build coal to oil projects prompted concerns about a new round of wasteful development and the [[unintended consequence]]s of such rapid development; these include wasteful extraction of coal, excessive water use (this process requires 10 tons of water for every ton of oil produced), and likely increases in the price of coal.<ref name=\"AutoJV-51\" />\n\nChina and [[Russia]] are in talks to link their electric power networks so that China can buy power from the [[Russian Far East]] to supply [[Northeast China]] ([[Dongbei]]). The benefits for China of importing power from neighboring countries include conserving domestic resources, lowering energy consumption, lessening China's dependence on imported oil (80%-90% of which must be shipped through unsafe waters) and reducing pollution discharge. China already has begun to build a 1 MV [[High voltage|high-tension demonstration project]] and an 800 kV direct power transmission project; after 2010 China will have a long-distance high-tension, high-capacity line for international transmission. China also is considering connecting its power transmission lines with [[Mongolia]] and several [[former Soviet states]] that border China; specialists predict that by the year 2020 more than 4 PWh of power will be transmitted to China from neighboring states. In that year China is expected to produce 250 megatons of crude oil and be required to import approximately 350 megatons of crude oil, a reliance on exports of 60%. If China is able to import 620 TWh of power from neighbors, it will be able to reduce crude oil imports by 100 megatons. By importing electricity China will not only reduce its dependence on imported crude oil, but also will enhance energy security by diversifying its foreign energy sources, making China less vulnerable to disruptions in supply.<ref name=\"AutoJV-55\" />\n\nIn 2006 a total of 2.8344 PWh of electricity was generated in China from an installed base of 622 GW of power generating capacity; in 2006 alone an additional 105 GW of installed capacity came on line in China.<ref name=\"AutoJV-53\" /> Experts estimate that another 100 GW of newly installed [[electric power]] generating capacity will again come on-line in 2007, but that 2006 probably was the high-water mark for electric power capacity development in China.<ref name=\"AutoJV-54\" />\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Renewable energy|China}}\n'''China'''\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Wind power in China]]\n* [[Solar power in China]]\n* [[Geothermal power in China]]\n* [[Bioenergy in China]]\n* [[List of power stations in China]]\n* [[List of offshore wind farms in China]]\n* [[Automotive industry in China]]\n* [[Climate change in China]]\n* [[Electric vehicle industry in China]]\n* [[Energy policy of China]]\n* [[Pollution in China]]\n* [[Three Gorges Dam]]\n\n{{Div col end}}\n'''Global'''\n{{Div col|colwidth=27em}}\n* [[Renewable energy in Asia]]\n* [[International Renewable Energy Agency]] (IRENA)\n* [[World energy resources and consumption]]\n* [[Renewable energy commercialization]]\n* [[REN21|The Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century(REN21)]]\n* [[Hydrogen economy]]\n* [[Global warming]]\n* [[Greenhouse effect]]\n* [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]]\n* [[Renewable energy legislation and incentives]]\n* [[Sustainable energy]]\n* [[Renewable energy by country]]{{Div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<!--ref name=\"AutoJV-1\">[http://www.chinaenvironment.net/pace/more.php?id=453_0_5_0 PACE 2007- International Forum on Development in China]</ref-->\n<!--ref name=worldwatch>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5491|title=Powering China's Development: The Role of Renewable Energy|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2014}}</ref-->\n<ref name=\"ecosensorium.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ecosensorium.org/2010/11/china-tops-world-in-clean-energy.html|title=China tops the world in clean energy production|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2014}}</ref>\n<!--ref name=\"AutoJV-2\">[http://eprints.ucl.ac.uk/16051/1/16051.pdf Caprotti F (2009) China's Cleantech Landscape: The Renewable Energy Technology Paradox ''Sustainable Development Law & Policy '' Spring 2009: 6-10]</ref-->\n<!--ref name=\"AutoJV-3\">[http://ecogeek.org/wind-power/2948-china-could-replace-coal-with-wind China Could Replace Coal with Wind]</ref-->\n<!--ref name=\"AutoJV-4\">[http://www.electroiq.com/photovoltaics/2012/03/12/china-to-drop-solar-energy-to-focus-on-nuclear-power.html China to Drop Solar Energy to Focus on Nuclear Power]</ref-->\n<!--ref name=\"AutoJV-5\">[http://www.hydroworld.com/index/display/news_display.1311386642.html China hydro capacity to reach 210 GW by year-end - official]</ref-->\n<ref name=\"AutoJV-6\">[http://cdm.ccchina.gov.cn/english/NewsInfo.asp?NewsId=982 Approval status of CDM projects in China(up to 16 June 2006)]</ref>\n<ref name=\"AutoJV-7\">[http://www.ccchina.gov.cn/WebSite/CCChina/UpFile/File188.pdf China's National Climate Change Programme, 2007-06-04]</ref>\n<ref name=\"AutoJV-8\">{{cite web|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/english/200005/24/eng20000524_41520.html|title=China To Launch Massive Hydropower Construction in 21st Century|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2014}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"AutoJV-9\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=chinas-big-push-for-renewable-energy|title=China's Big Push for Renewable Energy: Scientific American|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2014}}</ref>\n<ref name=renew>{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/story?id=52764|title=China's Wind Power Industry: Blowing Past Expectations|work=Renewable Energy World|accessdate=10 October 2014}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"AutoJV-10\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/feb/03/wind-power-eu|title=Wind power becomes Europe's fastest growing energy source|work=the Guardian|accessdate=10 October 2014}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"AutoJV-11\">{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/31/business/energy-environment/31renew.html | work=The New York Times | title=China Leading Global Race to Make Clean Energy | first=Keith | last=Bradsher | date=30 January 2010}}</ref>\n<ref name=re>[[REN21]] (2009).
