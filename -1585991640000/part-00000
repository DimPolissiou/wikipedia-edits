He made his first appearance in the film ''[[Shrek 2]]'' (2004), soon becoming [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]]'s partner and helper (alongside [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]]). In the film ''[[Shrek the Third]]'' (2007), Puss helps Shrek find the heir to the throne of the Far Far Away Kingdom. The film ''[[Shrek Forever After]]'' (2010) is primarily set in an [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternate universe]], where Puss is [[Princess Fiona]]'s [[pet]] and has gained weight after his retirement. In the [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] and [[prequel]] ''Puss in Boots'', his origins are described. Puss also appears in the [[Netflix]] television series centered on him, ''[[The Adventures of Puss in Boots]]''.\n\nPuss was inspired by the title [[Character (arts)|character]] of the [[fairy tale]] \"[[Puss in Boots]]\". His design, created by Tom Hester, was based on real [[cats]]. Several characters were used as inspirations for Puss's characterization, such as [[Zorro]] and [[Indiana Jones]]. The idea of Puss as the protagonist of a film was explored after his debut appearance. [[Antonio Banderas]] voices Puss in the English, Spanish, and Italian [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubs]] of the ''Shrek'' franchise. While he initially tried a high-pitched voice for the character, he and the ''Shrek 2'' filmmakers decided on a tone that was deeper than his normal voice. Banderas said that voicing Puss was an important part of his career. [[Eric Bauza]] provides Puss's voice in ''The Adventures of Puss in Boots''.\n\nThe character has received generally positive reviews, with critics praising his depiction and considering him a source of [[comic relief]].

Shrek returns to the real universe, where Puss (as his usual self) enjoys the birthday party with the other characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jul/01/shrek-forever-after-film-review|title=Shrek Forever After|date=July 1, 2010|last=Bradshaw|first=Peter|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=July 4, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180704001126/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jul/01/shrek-forever-after-film-review|archive-date=July 4, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all|author-link=Peter Bradshaw}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/shrek-forever/review/|title=Shrek Forever After Review|date=June 1, 2010|last=White|first=James|magazine=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]|access-date=July 4, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180704013649/https://www.empireonline.com/movies/shrek-forever/review/|archive-date=July 4, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/2010/05/21/shrek-forever-after-3/|title=Shrek Forever After|date=May 21, 2010|last=Schwarzbaum|first=Lisa|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|access-date=September 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180921003224/https://ew.com/article/2010/05/21/shrek-forever-after-3/|archive-date=September 21, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all|author-link=Lisa Schwarzbaum}}</ref>\n\n===''Puss in Boots''===\n{{main|Puss in Boots (2011 film)}}\nThe film ''Puss in Boots'' is a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] from, and [[prequel]] to, the ''Shrek'' films.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2011/10/28/feline-less-than-groovy/|title=Feline less than groovy|date=October 28, 2011|last=Lumenick|first=Lou|newspaper=[[New York Post]]|access-date=August 29, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180829171509/https://nypost.com/2011/10/28/feline-less-than-groovy/|archive-date=August 29, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all|author-link=Lou Lumenick}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/75089-guillermo-del-toro-adds-puss-in-boots-cameo|title=Guillermo del Toro Adds Puss in Boots Cameo|date=March 9, 2011|last=Lesnick|first=Silas|website=[[CraveOnline#Owned or associated websites|ComingSoon]]|access-date=August 29, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180829182222/http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/75089-guillermo-del-toro-adds-puss-in-boots-cameo|archive-date=August 29, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=TheIndependent/> It begins by presenting Puss's [[Pseudonym|aliases]], including \"Diablo Gato\",<ref name=Aliases1>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/risky-business/antonio-banderas-salma-hayek-bring-187435|title=Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek Bring 'Puss in Boots' to France (Cannes)|date=May 11, 2011|last=Fernandez|first=Jay A.|magazine=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|access-date=September 20, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180920232447/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/risky-business/antonio-banderas-salma-hayek-bring-187435|archive-date=September 20, 2018|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> \"The Furry Lover\",<ref name=Aliases1/> \"Chupacabra\",<ref name=Aliases1/> \"Frisky Two Times\",<ref name=Aliases2>{{cite web|url=https://www.ocregister.com/2011/10/27/puss-in-boots-is-a-purr-fect-family-film-2/|title='Puss in Boots' is a purr-fect family film|date=October 27, 2011|last=Moore|first=Roger|newspaper=[[Orange County Register]]|access-date=September 20, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180920233229/https://www.ocregister.com/2011/10/27/puss-in-boots-is-a-purr-fect-family-film-2/|archive-date=September 20, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and \"The Ginger Hit Man\".<ref name=Aliases2/> After he was abandoned when he was little, Puss finds shelter at an orphanage in the town of San Ricardo and is adopted by [[List of Shrek characters#Imelda|Imelda]].

Puss performs a heroic act, for which he receives acclaim and his boots. His bond with Humpty begins to fray, and Humpty compels Puss to (unknowingly) rob a bank with him. Puss leaves San Ricardo; years later, he learns who owns the magic beans and plans to steal them. He meets a cat who also wants to steal them: Kitty Softpaws, Humpty's partner. Humpty asks Puss to join them in their search for the beans, and Puss eventually accepts. They find the beans, plant them, and a beanstalk brings them to a castle in the sky. They find the Golden Goose and return with it to the ground. Puss returns to San Ricardo, where he realizes that Humpty has been plotting against him. Puss is arrested, and he learns that the [[List of Shrek characters#Great Terror|Golden Goose's mother]] will come and try to retrieve it. With Kitty's help, Puss escapes, goes to Humpty, and they reconcile. Humpty sacrifices himself to allow Puss to save the Golden Goose and return it to its mother (preventing the town's destruction), and Puss and Kitty escape the town guards.<ref name=IGN2/><ref

in the [[Shrek (franchise)|''Shrek'' franchise]] and the [[title character]] (and protagonist) of the film ''[[Puss in Boots (2011 film)|Puss in Boots]]'' (2011). He made his first appearance in the film ''[[Shrek 2]]'' (2004), soon becoming [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]]'s partner and helper (alongside [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]]). In the film ''[[Shrek the Third]]'' (2007), Puss helps Shrek find the heir to the throne of the Far Far Away Kingdom. The film ''[[Shrek Forever After]]'' (2010) is primarily set in an [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternate universe]], where Puss is [[Princess Fiona]]'s [[pet]] and has gained weight after his retirement. In the [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] and [[prequel]] ''Puss in Boots'', his origins are described. Puss also appears in the [[Netflix]] television series centered on him, ''[[The Adventures of Puss in Boots]]''.\n\nPuss was inspired by the title [[Character (arts)|character]] of the [[fairy tale]] \"[[Puss in Boots]]\". His design, created by Tom Hester, was based on real [[cats]]. Several characters were used as inspirations for Puss's characterization, such as [[Zorro]] and [[Indiana Jones]]. The idea of Puss as the protagonist of a film was explored after his debut appearance. [[Antonio Banderas]] voices Puss in the English, Spanish, and Italian [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubs]] of the ''Shrek'' franchise. While he initially tried a high-pitched voice for the character, he and the ''Shrek 2'' filmmakers decided on a tone that was deeper than his normal voice. Banderas said that voicing Puss was an important part of his career. [[Eric Bauza]] provides Puss's voice in ''The Adventures of Puss in Boots''.\n\nThe character has received generally positive reviews, with critics praising his depiction and considering him a source of [[comic relief]]. Reviewers have regarded Puss as a popular ''Shrek'' character. Banderas's [[voice acting]] has also been praised. Merchandise inspired by the character has been produced.\n\n==Development==\n==={{anchor|Conception and creation}}Concept and creation===\nPuss in Boots is inspired by the [[title character]] of the [[Puss in Boots|fairy tale]] with the same name.<ref name=ComicBookResources>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/director-chris-miller-ventures-into-surreal-world-of-puss-in-boots/|title=Director Chris Miller Ventures Into 'Surreal' World of Puss in Boots|date=October 28, 2011|last=Levin|first=Rob|website=[[Comic Book Resources]]|access-date=June 30, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180703231847/https://www.cbr.com/director-chris-miller-ventures-into-surreal-world-of-puss-in-boots/|archive-date=July 3, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> [[Character (arts)|Character]] designer Tom Hester provided Puss's design, which was based on [[cat]]s owned by ''[[Shrek]]'' [[Film director|director]] [[Andrew Adamson]] and effects supervisor Ken Bielenberg.

Shrek returns to the real universe, where Puss (as his usual self) enjoys the birthday party with the other characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jul/01/shrek-forever-after-film-review|title=Shrek Forever After|date=July 1, 2010|last=Bradshaw|first=Peter|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=July 4, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180704001126/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jul/01/shrek-forever-after-film-review|archive-date=July 4, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all|author-link=Peter Bradshaw}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/shrek-forever/review/|title=Shrek Forever After Review|date=June 1, 2010|last=White|first=James|magazine=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]|access-date=July 4, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180704013649/https://www.empireonline.com/movies/shrek-forever/review/|archive-date=July 4, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/2010/05/21/shrek-forever-after-3/|title=Shrek Forever After|date=May 21, 2010|last=Schwarzbaum|first=Lisa|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|access-date=September 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180921003224/https://ew.com/article/2010/05/21/shrek-forever-after-3/|archive-date=September 21, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all|author-link=Lisa Schwarzbaum}}</ref>\n\n===''Puss in Boots''===\n{{main|Puss in Boots (2011 film)}}\nThe film ''Puss in Boots'' is a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] from, and [[prequel]] to, the ''Shrek'' films.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2011/10/28/feline-less-than-groovy/|title=Feline less than groovy|date=October 28, 2011|last=Lumenick|first=Lou|newspaper=[[New York Post]]|access-date=August 29, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180829171509/https://nypost.com/2011/10/28/feline-less-than-groovy/|archive-date=August 29, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all|author-link=Lou Lumenick}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/75089-guillermo-del-toro-adds-puss-in-boots-cameo|title=Guillermo del Toro Adds Puss in Boots Cameo|date=March 9, 2011|last=Lesnick|first=Silas|website=[[CraveOnline#Owned or associated websites|ComingSoon]]|access-date=August 29, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180829182222/http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/75089-guillermo-del-toro-adds-puss-in-boots-cameo|archive-date=August 29, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=TheIndependent/> It begins by presenting Puss's [[Pseudonym|aliases]], including \"Diablo Gato\",<ref name=Aliases1>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/risky-business/antonio-banderas-salma-hayek-bring-187435|title=Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek Bring 'Puss in Boots' to France (Cannes)|date=May 11, 2011|last=Fernandez|first=Jay A.|magazine=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|access-date=September 20, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180920232447/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/risky-business/antonio-banderas-salma-hayek-bring-187435|archive-date=September 20, 2018|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> \"The Furry Lover\",<ref name=Aliases1/> \"Chupacabra\",<ref name=Aliases1/> \"Frisky Two Times\",<ref name=Aliases2>{{cite web|url=https://www.ocregister.com/2011/10/27/puss-in-boots-is-a-purr-fect-family-film-2/|title='Puss in Boots' is a purr-fect family film|date=October 27, 2011|last=Moore|first=Roger|newspaper=[[Orange County Register]]|access-date=September 20, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180920233229/https://www.ocregister.com/2011/10/27/puss-in-boots-is-a-purr-fect-family-film-2/|archive-date=September 20, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and \"The Ginger Hit Man\".<ref name=Aliases2/> After he was abandoned when he was little, Puss finds shelter at an orphanage in the town of San Ricardo and is adopted by [[List of Shrek characters#Imelda|Imelda]].

Puss performs a heroic act, for which he receives acclaim and his boots. His bond with Humpty begins to fray, and Humpty compels Puss to (unknowingly) rob a bank with him. Puss leaves San Ricardo; years later, he learns who owns the magic beans and plans to steal them. He meets a cat who also wants to steal them: Kitty Softpaws, Humpty's partner. Humpty asks Puss to join them in their search for the beans, and Puss eventually accepts. They find the beans, plant them, and a beanstalk brings them to a castle in the sky. They find the Golden Goose and return with it to the ground. Puss returns to San Ricardo, where he realizes that Humpty has been plotting against him. Puss is arrested, and he learns that the [[List of Shrek characters#Great Terror|Golden Goose's mother]] will come and try to retrieve it. With Kitty's help, Puss escapes, goes to Humpty, and they reconcile. Humpty sacrifices himself to allow Puss to save the Golden Goose and return it to its mother (preventing the town's destruction), and Puss and Kitty escape the town guards.<ref name=IGN2/><ref

The school was founded in 1970 and serves about 1400 students in kindergarten through 12th grade. The school is jointly accredited by the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] and the [[Southern Association of Independent Schools]], and the [[North Carolina Department of Public Instruction]].\n\n==History==\nThe school was founded in 1970, during the period of [[school desegregation in the United States]].\nIn their treatise on [[segregation academies]], the historians David Nevin and Robert Bills argued that, although Charlotte Latin was not founded in response to the desegregation of public schools, the school's early growth could be attributed to parents seeking to avoid racial integration.<ref>{{Cite book| title= The schools that fear built: segregationist academies in the South|last=Nevin| first=David |date=1976| publisher=Acropolis Books |last2= Bills| first2= Robert E| isbn=0874911796| location=Washington| oclc=2645093| page=8}}</ref>\n\nDon Roberson, a leader of an [[desegregation busing|anti-busing]] parents group, enrolled his children in Charlotte Latin, saying, \"I've simply taken my children off the battlefield while I fight the battle.\"<ref name=\"lass2013\">{{cite book| last1=Lassiter| first1= Matthew T.| title=The Silent Majority: Suburban Politics in the Sunbelt South |date=Oct 24, 2013| publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=9781400849420| page=165, 169| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_a0EAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA368&lpg=PA368&dq=charlotte+latin+segregation&source=bl&ots=q0ClbZYNpa&sig=c_EnDNbu09n9EVpFpdrKDZvpNaw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiRnO3BisvYAhWq54MKHe85ALc4ChDoAQgoMAA#v=onepage&q=latin&f=false| accessdate=9 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1970, the [[IRS]] conducted an investigation into the tax exempt status of all newly established private schools that may have been founded in response to the desegregation of public schools. After investigating Charlotte Latin School, the IRS agreed to grant the school tax exempt status after the school published its non-discrimation policy in a local newspaper.<ref>{{citenews |date=October 8, 1970|page= 13|title=Rulings Revealed|location=Statesville, NC|newspaper= Record & Landmark|url= https://www.newspapers.com/image/4141133/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref>\n\nIn September 1970, Charlotte Latin School opened its doors for the first time with 425 students in grades one through nine. The {{convert|50|acre|ha|sing=on}} campus consisted of two buildings: today's Lower School Building and the Administrative Building, which is now Fennebresque Hall. The campus continued to grow with the construction of the 100/200 building, the library (which is now Founders' Hall), and Belk Gymnasium in 1972 and 1973. During 1974\u20131975, an addition to the Lower School was built and the football field was completed.\n\nLatin graduated its first senior class in 1974 and was accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) in 1975, and in 1976\u20131977, Latin was honored as the youngest school in the nation to receive a [[Cum Laude Society]] chapter. It was during the 1976\u201377 school year that the Middle School building also was completed.\n\nDuring 1980\u20131981, the school expanded with the addition of {{convert|42|acre|ha}}, which makes up the South Campus. In 1988, Latin's Upper School received the Blue Ribbon School of Excellence Award from the [[United States Department of Education]].\n\nSwimMAC Carolina, originally named the Mecklenburg Aquatic Club (MAC), opened on the Latin campus in 1990. This 22-lane natatorium is operated by SwimMAC, but also serves as Latin's pool. SwimMAC has produced several Olympians, and has enabled Latin to win numerous swimming titles.{{CN|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn 1998, Charlotte Latin won the Blue Ribbon School of Excellence Award a second time, this time for the Lower School.\n\nDuring the 1999\u20132000 school year, Latin purchased an additional {{convert|30|acre|ha}}, bringing the campus to {{convert|122|acre|ha}}. It is during this time that the Middle School also won the Blue Ribbon School of Excellence Award.\n\nThe Science, Art and Technology Building and the Beck Student Activities Center opened during the 2000\u20132001 school year. At the conclusion of the 2000\u201301 school year, Edward J. Fox, Sr. retired after serving twenty-five years as the school's headmaster. Arch N. McIntosh, Jr. was named as Latin's new headmaster. At the conclusion of the 2018-19 school year, Arch N. McIntosh, Jr. retired after serving 19 years as headmaster. Charles (Chuck) Baldecchi was named his replacement.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{alumni|date=March 2019}}\n{{refimprove section|date=June 2018}}\n}}\n* [[Brenton Bersin]], [[NFL]] wide receiver\n* [[Chris Canty (defensive end)|Chris Canty]], NFL defensive end and [[Super Bowl XLIV]] champion with the [[New York Giants]]\n* [[Michael Chadwick (swimmer)|Michael Chadwick]], [[swimming (sport)|swimmer]] and [[United States|USA]] National swim team member<ref>https://www.teamusa.org/usa-swimming/athletes/Michael-Chadwick Michael Chadwick].

The school is jointly accredited by the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] and the [[Southern Association of Independent Schools]], and the [[North Carolina Department of Public Instruction]].\n\n==History==\nThe school was founded in 1970, during the period of [[school desegregation in the United States]].\nIn their treatise on [[segregation academies]], the historians David Nevin and Robert Bills argued that, although Charlotte Latin was not founded in response to the desegregation of public schools, the school's early growth could be attributed to parents seeking to avoid racial integration.<ref>{{Cite book| title= The schools that fear built: segregationist academies in the South|last=Nevin| first=David |date=1976| publisher=Acropolis Books |last2= Bills| first2= Robert E| isbn=0874911796| location=Washington| oclc=2645093| page=8}}</ref>\n\nDon Roberson, a leader of an [[desegregation busing|anti-busing]] parents group, enrolled his children in Charlotte Latin, saying, \"I've simply taken my children off the battlefield while I fight the battle.\"<ref name=\"lass2013\">{{cite book| last1=Lassiter| first1= Matthew T.| title=The Silent Majority: Suburban Politics in the Sunbelt South |date=Oct 24, 2013| publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=9781400849420| page=165, 169| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_a0EAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA368&lpg=PA368&dq=charlotte+latin+segregation&source=bl&ots=q0ClbZYNpa&sig=c_EnDNbu09n9EVpFpdrKDZvpNaw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiRnO3BisvYAhWq54MKHe85ALc4ChDoAQgoMAA#v=onepage&q=latin&f=false| accessdate=9 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1970, the [[IRS]] conducted an investigation into the tax exempt status of all newly established private private schools that may have been founded in response to the desegregation of public schools. After investigating Charlotte Latin School, the IRS agreed to grant the school tax exempt status after the school published its non-discrimation policy in a local newspaper.<ref>{{citenews |date=October 8, 1970|page= 13|title=Rulings Revealed|location=Statesville, NC|newspaper= Record & Landmark|url= https://www.newspapers.com/image/4141133/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref>\n\nIn September 1970, Charlotte Latin School opened its doors for the first time with 425 students in grades one through nine. The {{convert|50|acre|ha|sing=on}} campus consisted of two buildings: today's Lower School Building and the Administrative Building, which is now Fennebresque Hall. The campus continued to grow with the construction of the 100/200 building, the library (which is now Founders' Hall), and Belk Gymnasium in 1972 and 1973. During 1974\u20131975, an addition to the Lower School was built and the football field was completed.\n\nLatin graduated its first senior class in 1974 and was accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) in 1975, and in 1976\u20131977, Latin was honored as the youngest school in the nation to receive a [[Cum Laude Society]] chapter. It was during the 1976\u201377 school year that the Middle School building also was completed.\n\nDuring 1980\u20131981, the school expanded with the addition of {{convert|42|acre|ha}}, which makes up the South Campus. In 1988, Latin's Upper School received the Blue Ribbon School of Excellence Award from the [[United States Department of Education]].\n\nSwimMAC Carolina, originally named the Mecklenburg Aquatic Club (MAC), opened on the Latin campus in 1990. This 22-lane natatorium is operated by SwimMAC, but also serves as Latin's pool. SwimMAC has produced several Olympians, and has enabled Latin to win numerous swimming titles.{{CN|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn 1998, Charlotte Latin won the Blue Ribbon School of Excellence Award a second time, this time for the Lower School.\n\nDuring the 1999\u20132000 school year, Latin purchased an additional {{convert|30|acre|ha}}, bringing the campus to {{convert|122|acre|ha}}. It is during this time that the Middle School also won the Blue Ribbon School of Excellence Award.\n\nThe Science, Art and Technology Building and the Beck Student Activities Center opened during the 2000\u20132001 school year. At the conclusion of the 2000\u201301 school year, Edward J. Fox, Sr. retired after serving twenty-five years as the school's headmaster. Arch N. McIntosh, Jr. was named as Latin's new headmaster. At the conclusion of the 2018-19 school year, Arch N. McIntosh, Jr. retired after serving 19 years as headmaster. Charles (Chuck) Baldecchi was named his replacement.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{alumni|date=March 2019}}\n{{refimprove section|date=June 2018}}\n}}\n* [[Brenton Bersin]], [[NFL]] wide receiver\n* [[Chris Canty (defensive end)|Chris Canty]], NFL defensive end and [[Super Bowl XLIV]] champion with the [[New York Giants]]\n* [[Michael Chadwick (swimmer)|Michael Chadwick]], [[swimming (sport)|swimmer]] and [[United States|USA]] National swim team member<ref>https://www.teamusa.org/usa-swimming/athletes/Michael-Chadwick Michael Chadwick].
