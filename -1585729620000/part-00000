Many conversions were noted across eastern Anatolia, In [[Hamshen]], [[Yusufeli]], [[Tortum]], [[Ispir]], [[Bayburt]], [[Erzincan]]. Notably a mass conversion to Islam was described by an Armenian cleric Yakob Karnetsi In the region of [[Tayk]] centered around [[Tortum]], a Muslim cleric named Mullah Jaffar was given charge from the Ottomans to take census of the [[Erzurum]] province and to levy taxes. After Mullah Jaffar placed excessively heavy taxes the [[Chalcedonian]] Armenians who belonged to the [[Georgian Orthodox]] church and made up half of the population in Upper Armenia Converted to Islam while the Apostolic Armenians did not,  Yakop Karnetsi described Mullah Jaffar as an enemy of Christians who oppressed Armenians.\n<ref>https://www.academia.edu/10794160/Hemshin_from_Islamicization_to_the_End_of_the_Nineteenth_Century</ref>\n\nIn the region of [[Ispir]](Sper in Armenian) 100 [[Armenia]]n villages were burned down in 1723 and much of the population was converted to [[Islam]] by force. In the region of [[Yusufeli]](Pertakrak in Armenian) [[Armenian Catholic]] priest Inchichian writes that most of the [[Muslim]] population was [[Armenians|Armenian]] in origin but had converted to [[Islam]] to escape brutal taxation and oppression in the early 1700s. he visited the village of Khewag([[Yaylalar]]) and met Islamized Armenians in the village.

In the region of [[Dersim]] the patriarchate of Constantinople reported that groups of [[Armenians]] had converted to [[Alevi]] Islam and had assimilated with Kurdish [[Zazas]] who had migrated to Armenia during Ottoman rule.<ref>http://www.fundamentalarmenology.am/datas/pdfs/292.pdf</ref> similarly in the region of Palu some Armenian villages converted to [[Sunni]] Islam and assimilated into the Sunni Zaza community.<ref>http://westernarmeniatv.com/en/10928/%d5%a4%d5%a5%d6%80%d5%bd%d5%ab%d5%b4%d5%ab-%d5%a1%d5%ac%d6%87%d5%ab%d5%a1%d6%81%d5%a1%d5%ae-%d5%b0%d5%a1%d5%b5%d5%a5%d6%80%d5%a8</ref> \n\nPeriodic forced conversions created a class of crypto-Christian Armenians called Kes-kes (half-half) who practiced both Christian and Muslim rituals. the [[Armenians]] who converted to [[Islam]] lost their Armenian identity because they switched millets, but many kept the Armenian language and culture In eastern Anatolia, however they were eventually turkified except for the Armenians of [[Hamshen]] who kept their language in the isolated [[Pontic Mountains|Pontic]] mountains until Turkish Muslim schools were opened in the 1800s and the western [[Hamshens]] became Turkified as the language was condemned as sinful by Muslim teachers. Only the [[Hopa]] Hamshens have preserved their language in the modern era.<ref>http://www.fundamentalarmenology.am/datas/pdfs/292.pdf</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Hamidian massacres]] when [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] tribes were incited by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] government to attack and destroy [[Armenia]]n settlements many Armenian were forced to convert to Islam throughout eastern Anatolia, In [[Diyarbakir]] 20,000 were converted. Many also converted in [[Mu\u015f|Mush]], [[Van]], and [[Erzurum]]. Although many returned to Christianity after the massacres ended, many remained Muslims and became Kurdified and Turkified. In the region of [[Sivas]] in the early 19th century many Armenian villages were forced to convert to Islam by the local government. The village of Cancova(Cancik) in [[Zara, Turkey|Zara]] was a village of 400 Armenian families in 1877 but only 48 families remained christian by the 20th century. The Catholic Armenians of Perkinik reported that their neighboring village of Glkhategh(now Uzuntepe) was an Armenian village and the Armenians were forcibly converted to Islam and turkified. During the [[Armenian genocide]] of 1915 many Armenians converted to Islam to escape deportation and massacre.<ref>http://www.maggieblanck.com/Azarian/PirkinikJT/ch5.htm</ref>\n\n=== Under Iranian Empires ===\n\n[[File:Bluemosqueyerev.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The [[Blue Mosque, Yerevan]].]]\nThe Iranian [[Safavids]] (who had changed from being Sunni to Shia Muslims by then), established definite control over Armenia and far beyond since the time of [[Shah Ismail I]] in the early 16th century. Even though they often competed with the Ottomans over the territory, what is today Armenia always stayed an integral part of Persian territory, during the following centuries until they had to cede it to Russia following the [[Russo-Persian War (1826-1828)]]. Many Armenians joined the Safavid functions, in the civil administration and the military (the so-called ''ghulams'') since the time of [[Abbas I of Persia|Shah Abbas]] the Great. Especially amongst these elite soldier units, the ghulams (literally meaning ''slaves''), many of them were converted Armenians, alongside the masses of [[Circassians]] and [[Georgians]]. Before joining these functions, whether in the civil administration or military, they always had to convert to Islam, like in the Ottoman Empire, but the ones who stayed Christian (but couldn't get to the highest functions) did not have to pay extra taxes unlike the Ottoman Empire.\n\nAs a part of Abbas his [[scorched earth]] policy during his wars against the Ottomans, and also to boost his empire's economy, he alone deported some 300,000 Armenians from the [[Armenian Highlands|Armenian highland]] including the territory of modern-day [[Armenia]], to the heartland of [[Iran]].<ref>Avedis Krikor Sanjian.

His successors continued to do more of these deportations and replacements with Turcomans and Kurds.\nThe Safavid suzerains also created the [[Erivan Khanate]] over the region, making it similar to a system as was made during the Achaemenid times were satraps would rule the area in place of the king letting the entire Armenian highland stay Muslim ruled, until the early 19th century.\n\nBy the time the Iranians had to cede their centuries long suzerainty over Armenia, the majority of the population in what is now Armenia were Muslims. (Persians, Azerbaijani's, Kurds and North Caucasians)\n\nDue to the early Shi'ite zeal of the Safavids to convert all populations of Iran to Shia Islam, Many Armenians were heavily pressured to convert throughout Eastern Armenia. The Catholic diocese of Nakhichevan reported that in the mid 1600s 130 Armenian families of the villages of Saltaq, Kirne had converted to Islam to avoid losing their belongings. The diocese pleaded with the Pope and the king of Spain to intercede with the Shah of Iran to lessen the persecution of Armenians. in the 1700s Catholic missionaries warned that if the forced conversions didn't stop, the entire Christian Armenian population would disappear from conversions and turkification, writing that there were only a handful Armenians left in the village of guznut in Ordubad province, these accounts indicate that large numbers of eastern Armenians became Muslim not just in Nakhchivan but in all provinces following the demographic disaster of the deportations of Shah Abbas and large settlement of Muslims in Armenia.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPQJ2WxDFxw</ref>\n\nThere were Islamized Armenian villages in what is today Azerbaijan in Shamakhi, Sheki, Vartashen(oguz) and in Gardman which converted during the Safavid period. Nowadays those villages are assimilated into Azeri culture and have lost Armenian cultural identity. The Islamized villages of Sheki were Kish, Zayzit, Parkes, Kungut (Bash and Ghshlagh), Turk-Orban.<ref>[[:hy:%D5%87%D5%A1%D6%84%D5%AB (%D6%84%D5%A1%D5%B2%D5%A1%D6%84)]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Soviet period===\n\nWith the historical provinces being subsumed within the borders of the [[Republic of Turkey]] in 1923, the remainder of Armenia became a part of the [[Soviet Socialist Republic of Armenia]].

His successors continued to do more of these deportations and replacements with Turcomans and Kurds.\nThe Safavid suzerains also created the [[Erivan Khanate]] over the region, making it similar to a system as was made during the Achaemenid times were satraps would rule the area in place of the king letting the entire Armenian highland stay Muslim ruled, until the early 19th century.\n\nBy the time the Iranians had to cede their centuries long suzerainty over Armenia, the majority of the population in what is now Armenia were Muslims. (Persians, Azerbaijani's, Kurds and North Caucasians)\n\nDue to the early Shi'ite zeal of the Safavids to convert all populations of Iran to Shia Islam, Many Armenians were heavily pressured to convert throughout Eastern Armenia. The Catholic diocese of Nakhichevan reported that in the mid 1600s 130 Armenian families of the villages of Saltaq, Kirne had converted to Islam to avoid losing their belongings. The diocese pleaded with the Pope and the king of Spain to intercede with the Shah of Iran to lessen the persecution of Armenians. in the 1700s Catholic missionaries warned that if the forced conversions didn't stop, the entire Christian Armenian population would disappear from conversions and turkification, writing that there were only a handful Armenians left in the village of guznut in Ordubad province, these accounts indicate that large numbers of eastern Armenians became Muslim not just in Nakhchivan but in all provinces following the demographic disaster of the deportations of Shah Abbas and large settlement of Muslims in Armenia.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPQJ2WxDFxw</ref>\n\nThere were Islamized Armenian villages in what is today Azerbaijan in Shamakhi, Sheki, Vartashen(oguz) and in Gardman which converted during the Safavid period. Nowadays those villages are assimilated into Azeri culture and have lost Armenian cultural identity. The Islamized villages of Sheki were Kish, Zayzit, Parkes, Kungut (Bash and Ghshlagh), Turk-Orban.<ref>[[:hy:%D5%87%D5%A1%D6%84%D5%AB (%D6%84%D5%A1%D5%B2%D5%A1%D6%84)]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Soviet period===\n\nWith the historical provinces being subsumed within the borders of the [[Republic of Turkey]] in 1923, the remainder of Armenia became a part of the [[Soviet Socialist Republic of Armenia]]. A small number of Muslims were resident in Armenia while it was a part of the [[Soviet Union]], consisting mainly of [[Azeris]] and [[Kurds]], the great majority of whom left in 1988 after the [[Sumgait Pogroms]] and the [[Nagorno Karabakh War]], which caused the Armenian and Azeri communities of each country to have something of a population exchange, with Armenia getting around 500,000 Armenians priorly living in Azerbaijan outside of the Nagorno Karabakh Republic,<ref name=\"Wiener Zeitung\"/> and the Azeris getting around 724,000 people who were forced from Armenia and Nagorno Karabakh.<ref name=\"Wiener Zeitung\">\"[http://www.wienerzeitung.at/nachrichten/welt/weltpolitik/513109_Gefaehrliche-Toene-im-Frozen-War.html Gef\u00e4hrliche T\u00f6ne im \"Frozen War\"].\" ''[[Wiener Zeitung]]''. 2 January 2013.</ref> \n\n=== Independent Armenia ===\nSince Armenia gained its independence in 1991, the majority of Muslims still living in the country are temporary residents from [[Iran]] and other countries.
