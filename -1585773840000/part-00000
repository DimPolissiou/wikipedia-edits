Sotomayor's nomination was submitted to the [[United States Senate]] on June 1, 2009, when the [[111th United States Congress|111th Congress]] reconvened after its Memorial Day recess. Sotomayor was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on August 6, 2009 by a 68\u201331 vote and was commissioned by President Obama the same day. She was sworn in by [[Chief Justice]] [[John Roberts]] on August 8, 2009.\n\nWhen nominated, Sotomayor was a sitting judge of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]], a position to which she had been appointed by [[Bill Clinton]] in 1998. Earlier, she served on the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]], appointed by [[George H. W. Bush]] in 1992.\n\n== Nomination ==\n=== Potential candidates ===\nOn May 1, 2009, [[David Souter]] announced that he would retire from the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] on June 29, at the start of Court's summer 2009 recess. He had served as an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|associate justice]] for 19 years. This was the first opportunity for [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]], who [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|took office]] in January 2009, to fill a Supreme Court vacancy. The president and his advisors had begun preparing for this eventuality since before he was sworn in as president, during the [[United States presidential transition|transition]]. After Souter's retirement plans were announced, [[Sonia Sotomayor]] received early attention as the front-runner to succeed him. Others topping the various lists of most-likely candidates included: [[Elena Kagan]], [[Diane Wood]] and [[Jennifer Granholm]].<ref>{{cite news| last1=Gerstein| first1=Josh| last2=Allen| first2=Mike| date=May 1, 2009| title=Souter exit starts court war| url=https://www.politico.com/story/2009/04/souter-exit-starts-court-war-021972| publisher=Politico| accessdate=June 23, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| first=Scott| last=Shepard| title=Speculation Already Under Way on Possible Obama Supreme Court Nominations| url=http://www.coxwashington.com/hp/content/reporters/stories/2008/22/2008/11/24/OBAMA_SCOTUS23_COX.html| publisher=Cox News Service| date=November 24, 2008 |access-date=June 23, 2019| url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218161611/http://www.coxwashington.com/hp/content/reporters/stories/2008/22/2008/11/24/OBAMA_SCOTUS23_COX.html| archive-date=February 18, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| first=Sam| last=Stein| title=Inside Obama's Court Deliberations: Sotomayor Most Mentioned | url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/inside-obamas-court-delib_n_194887| work=HuffPost| publisher=Huffington Post| date=May 1, 2009| accessdate=June 23, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Edward A. |last=Adams |title=Who Will Replace Justice Souter? |url=http://abajournal.com/news/who_will_replace_justice_souter |work=ABA Journal |publisher= |date=April 30, 2009 |accessdate=May 1, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/bronx-judge-sonia-sotomayor-latina-supreme-court-replaces-justice-souter-article-1.408228|title=Bronx judge Sonia Sotomayor would be first Latina on Supreme Court if she replaces Justice Souter |date=May 1, 2009|work=The Daily News|accessdate=June 23, 2019 | location=New York | first=Michael | last=Saul}}</ref>\n\n=== Announcement ===\nOn May 26, 2009, President Obama announced that he would nominate Sotomayor to the court.

Senator [[Jeff Sessions]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Alabama|AL]]) brought up Sotomayor's membership in the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund as concern over Sotomayor's decision in reviewing the district court case ''[[Ricci v.

Sotomayor also said she was \"very humbled\" to be nominated, noting also she had seen the American judiciary system from many different perspectives. During her speech, she commented,. \"The task of a judge is not to make the law, it is to apply the law\".<ref name=\"The Hill Day 1\"/> Alexander Bolton of ''The Hill'' attributed such a pledge to [[George W.

During her speech, Sotomayor also narrated her life story from her high school years while she lived in the projects, praising her mother: \"She set the example, studying alongside my brother and me at our kitchen table so that she could become a registered nurse.\"<ref name=\"The Hill Day 1\"/>\n\n=== Day 2 (July 14) ===\nOn July 14, 2009, the first round of questioning began. Committee Chairman [[Patrick Leahy]] (D-[[Vermont|VT]]) began the session, and largely focused on Sotomayor's judicial record. The nominee took the opportunity to explain her ideals, and described herself as impartial and deferential to precedent, noting \"It's important to remember that, as a job, I don't make law.\" Leahy then concentrated on the \"Tarzan burglar\" case, which Sotomayor prosecuted as assistant district attorney in Manhattan during the early 1980s. Sotomayor tied a series of incidents together and persuaded the trial judge to let her try the burglar on a number of crimes in one case. Leahy also gave Sotomayor the opportunity to explain her ruling in the ''[[Ricci v. DeStefano|Ricci]]'' case, which the Supreme Court overturned after a ruling by a panel of which she was a member. Sotomayor stated that the ruling was based on precedent, and that it would have come out differently in light of the standard subsequently established by the Supreme Court on appeal.<ref>[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2009/07/sotomayor-hearings-leahy-plays-defense-out-of-the-box.html Sotomayor hearings: Leahy plays defense out of the box]</ref>\n\nRanking Republican [[Jeff Sessions]] (R-[[Alabama|AL]]) then began questioning, and notably referenced her \"[[q:Sonia Sotomayor#\"A Latina judge's voice\"|wise Latina]]\" remark.

During one of Sotomayor's answers to Grassley, a protester notably erupted, shouting anti-[[Abortion in the United States|abortion]] statements that accused Sotomayor of being a \"baby killer\" and to \"save the babies.\" Grassley then joked that \"people always say I have the ability to turn people on,\" after the heckler had been taken out of the room and arrested by police.<ref>[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2009/07/sotomayor-hearings-protest-then-a-punch-line.html Sotomayor hearings: A protest \u2013 then a punch line]</ref>\n\nSenator [[Russ Feingold]] (D-WI) then questioned her on \"post-[[September 11 attacks|9/11]] policies,\" as well as her opinions on such cases as the Court's decisions in ''[[Rasul v.

Sotomayor responded by saying that \"[she] wouldn't approach the issue of judging in the way the president does.\" It was the first time that Sotomayor publicly attempted to distance herself from the president. Kyl also again referenced her \"wise Latina\" quote, and she again stated that it was meant to inspire young Latino students. Sotomayor also made clear that \"if you look at my history on the bench, you will know that I do not believe that any ethnic, gender or race group has an advantage in sound judging.\" Senator Leahy defended Sotomayor in the face of ridicule by Senator Kyl.<ref>[http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2009/07/14/20090714kyl-sotomayor14-ON.html Kyl forgoes pleasantries, presses Sotomayor]</ref>\n\nIn asking if Sotomayor felt sympathy for victims in cases that she had ruled on\u2014specifically a case involving a [[TWA Flight 800|TWA airliner which exploded]] off the coast of New York, in which the families of the victims, many poor, attempted to sue the manufacturer to recover some of their losses\u2014Senator [[Charles Schumer]] (D-[[New York (state)|NY]]) noted that \"empathy is the opposite of indifference.\" In a later statement, Schumer said that \"in [Sotomayor's] courtroom the rule of law always triumphs,\" with which Sotomayor agreed.<ref>[http://www.rttnews.com/Content/PoliticalNews.aspx?Node=B1&Id=1004621 Schumer Defends Sotomayor From Bias Claims]</ref>\n\nSotomayor's Latina woman statement was once again quoted up by Senator [[Lindsey Graham]] (R-[[South Carolina|SC]]).

Sotomayor demurred from criticizing Congress and more or less passed on answering. Durbin followed up on his death penalty question emphasizing his concern about courts following up on assuring appeals plaintiffs about [[DNA]] evidence that may have come to light since their convictions, and he also brought up the case of ''[[Ledbetter v.

Cornyn also noted a 1996 quote made by Sotomayor, in which she stated that judges can \"change law\". Sotomayor went on to claim that the statement was taken out of context, and that she was explaining the process of law to the public, and that judges \"can't change law. We are not lawmakers.\" Cornyn also asked if President Obama had asked Sotomayor's opinion on abortion rights. She responded that \"[he] did not ask me about any specific legal questions [...] or any social issues.\"<ref>[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5huyApqmCqq9U5Hw9jP5IYR1gSQEwD99EVGE80 Obama didn't ask abortion views, Sotomayor says]</ref> Cornyn ended asking for further explanation about her ruling in the ''Ricci'' case.<ref>[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2009/07/sotomayor-hearings-big-john.html Sotomayor hearings: Big John]</ref><ref>[http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2009/07/68494476/1 Sotomayor hearing resumes]</ref>\n\nSenator Ben Cardin (D-[[Maryland|MD]]) sought to balance Senator Lindsey Graham's selected anonymous statements, decrying about Sotomayor's temperament, by reading positive reviews from fellow lawyers and judges.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2009/07/14/DI2009071402205.html Sotomayor: Senators Begin Questioning, What to Expect Today]</ref> Cardin also raised the [[Voting Rights Act]], and inquired Sotomayor's opinion on the right of the public to participate in voting. Sotomayor stated that voting is a fundamental right, and that the Congress has done a good job in regard to protecting the right to vote. Cardin recognized Sotomayor's achievements at [[Princeton University]], and asked of her opinion of hearing different voices in public schools, as well as steps the federal government could take to further recognize diversity. Sotomayor cited the example of the [[University of Michigan]], which promoted \"as much diversity as possible.\" She also referenced the [[Equal Protection Clause]] under the law. In closing his statement, Cardin finally asked about Sotomayor's opinion on privacy, in terms of technology, and how it should be interpreted under the Constitution, which was \"written in the eighteenth century.\" Sotomayor made it clear that privacy is specifically protected under the Constitution.<ref>[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2009/07/sotomayor-hearings-judicial-temperament-or-temperamental-.html Sotomayor hearings: Judicial temperament \u2013 or temperamental?]</ref>\n\nIn reacting to the outbursts by anti-abortion advocates, Senator [[Tom Coburn]] (R-[[Oklahoma|OK]]) asked numerous questions in regard to abortion under the law. Sotomayor answered by stating that she would need to look at the respective states' laws in the individual cases, and that she would not be able to answer the question without being informed about the details of the specific case. She also made it clear that \"[judges] do not make policy\" in terms of abortion, but only apply the law as it is specified.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120712105617/http://campaignspot.nationalreview.com/post/?q=OGVhN2M2MGFlMTVjYzk2OGM5YTU2NTE5YWExMWQ4NmI= Coburn Turns The Sotomayor Hearings To Abortion]</ref><ref>[http://www.wbt.com/news/details.cfm?ap_id=D99EV3281 Sotomayor declines to talk about abortion views]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Coburn then went on to inquire about the Second Amendment, and referenced ''[[District of Columbia v. Heller]]'', in asking if it was or was not the fundamental right of Americans to bear arms. Sotomayor agreed with Coburn that there is a fundamental and individual right to bear arms under the Second Amendment. Going further, Coburn then inquired about Sotomayor's personal opinion on the right to self-defense, which Sotomayor steadfastly refused to answer according to her own opinion, answering instead by stating that under New York law, facing certain imminent threat, \"you can use force to repel that, and that would be legal.\"<ref>[https://archive.today/20120708002745/http://campaignspot.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MWNlOTE5NzFkOWQ3NDgyMGZkOWNhMmJmZGJhOWMyYmY= Without a Precedent, Sotomayor Has a Hard Time Expressing an Opinion]</ref> Coburn then asked if there was any right to use any foreign law in a judge's rulings in the United States.

Whitehouse then asked about Sotomayor's role in the [[LatinoJustice PRLDEF|Puerto Rican Legal Defense Fund]], inquiring if there was a vetting process in deciding the board members. Sotomayor stated there was none. Whitehouse then went on to ask about search and seizure, as well as the federal government's involvement in warrants, in terms of fighting \"terrorist extremists\". She stated that it was the judge's decision whether a warrant should or should not be issued, based on the evidence presented.<ref>[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2009/07/sotomayor-hearings-thumbs-up-for-the-american-jury-system.html Sotomayor hearings: Thumbs up for the American jury system]</ref>\n\nSenator [[Amy Klobuchar]] (D-[[Minnesota|MN]]) went back to previous statements made by Sotomayor, as to whether rulings should be based on personal feelings or on law. Sotomayor reiterated her statements that she can only \"apply the law\", and not make it. Klobuchar then asked about a child [[pornography]] case, in which a warrant was not properly attained. Sotomayor described that she had sided with the panel, which had ruled that the search was unconstitutional, but the police officers had acted in \"good faith\". Further statements by Klobuchar were very supportive of Sotomayor,<ref>[http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2009/07/13/klobuchar_sotomayor/ Klobuchar: 'I've been very impressed so far']</ref> and noted her sentencings of white collar defendants.<ref>[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2009/07/sotomayor-hearings-finally-moms-take-center-stage.html Sotomayor hearings: Finally, moms take center stage]</ref>\n\nSenator [[Ted Kaufman]] (D-[[Delaware|DE]]) asked about Sotomayor's tenure as a litigator of commercial law cases. Kaufman asked numerous questions about how her commercial practice incorporates itself into her current evaluations and rulings as a judge. Kaufman then referenced a case in which she ruled for legal immunity for the [[New York Stock Exchange]], despite Sotomayor's statement that their \"behavior was egregious\".<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/americasRegulatoryNews/idUSN1534921920090715 US court nominee won't discuss financial regulation]</ref>  Kaufman also asked questions on [[United States antitrust law|antitrust law]], and about how [[economic theory]] related to judicial decisions.<ref>[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2009/07/sotomayor-hearings-talking-business-is-a-bonus-and-a-bore.html Sotomayor hearings: Talking business is a bonus and a bore]</ref>\n\nAfter a brief recess, Senator [[Arlen Specter]] (D-[[Pennsylvania|PA]]) first complimented Sotomayor on her handling of questions during the hearing. Specter then once again brought up the \"wise Latina\" comments, and likened them to similar statements from others currently on the Supreme Court.<ref>[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2009/07/sotomayor-hearings-specter-tries-to-defuse-wise-latina-controversy.html Sotomayor hearings: Arlen Specter tries to defuse 'wise Latina' controversy]</ref> The terror surveillance program was then brought up, with Specter very critical of former President Bush's [[NSA warrantless surveillance controversy|wiretapping of US citizens without warrants]].

Franken asked about the role of [[Internet service providers]] regarding the issue of [[net neutrality]], in speeding up the provider's own content while slowing down other providers' content. Sotomayor stated that the \"role of the court is to not make the policy, it is to wait until Congress acts.\" Franken further pressed by asking \"Isn't there a compelling, overriding, first amendment right here, for Americans to have access to the internet?\" Sotomayor stated that \"rights are rights, and what the court looks at is how Congress balances those rights in a particular situation, and then judge whether that balance is within constitutional boundaries [...] and then we'll look at that and see if it's constitutional.\"<ref>[http://www.multichannel.com/article/315056-Franken_Will_Raise_Network_Neutrality_With_Sotomayor.php Franken Will Raise Network Neutrality With Sotomayor]</ref><ref>[http://news.gaeatimes.com/specter-likes-sotomayors-record-but-not-her-answers-110459/ Specter likes Sotomayor's record, but not her answers]</ref> Franken asked for the definition of \"judicial activism\", which Sotomayor said was neither descriptive of her nor a term she uses, averring that she does not use labels.<ref>[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2009/07/sotomayor-hearings-franken-talks-mason-and-judicial-activism.html Sotomayor hearings: Franken talks 'Mason' and judicial activism]</ref> Franken notably then pulled out his pocket Constitution, referencing the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] in noting the recent decision to uphold the Voting Rights Act, which Sotomayor declined to speak on because the case was pending a future ruling by the Supreme Court. Franken asked if the words ''birth control'' and ''privacy'' were in the Constitution, in reference to previous Senators' statements on whether or not the word ''abortion'' was in the Constitution. Sotomayor answered that neither of those words is in the Constitution, after which Franken asked if the Constitution was \"at all relevant\" in regard to certain issues, which Sotomayor argued against. Franken finally asked if privacy issues were involved in abortion rights, and Sotomayor agreed.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://campaignspot.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YTFlMmYzMGViZGU0MmFjYzljN2VmNDMyODU5YjZhYTM= |title=Al Franken, Determined to Get to the Bottom of the Perry Mason Controversy |access-date=2009-07-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721064714/http://campaignspot.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YTFlMmYzMGViZGU0MmFjYzljN2VmNDMyODU5YjZhYTM= |archive-date=2009-07-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe committee then adjourned to a closed session to review a [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] background check, which is a part of the regular vetting process. Then, after reconvening, Senator Jeff Sessions began his second round of questioning by bringing up the Puerto Rican Legal Defense Fund, and asked if she had been involved in fundraising. Sotomayor stated that board members serve other functions than fundraising, including \"employment, public health, education, and others.\" Senator Leahy then interjected, and followed up on his concerns over the Second Amendment. Senator Kohl then brought up arguments mentioned by Ted Kaufman in regard to antitrust laws, and Sotomayor responded by stating that she would, at the \"court's precedent, [...] apply it\" to the situation. Kohl then gave a statistic stating that the Supreme Court only hears \"about one percent\" of the cases that are brought before the court. Senator Orrin Hatch gave further arguments about the [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|Doctrine of Incorporation]], and further reviewed Sotomayor's statement of \"fidelity to the law\". Hatch also brought up the right to privacy, and that Sotomayor had stated that the Constitution \"cannot be bent\", and that courts \"can apply the words of the Constitution to the facts of the case before them.\" Hatch next brought up once again the issue of \"empathy\" in judicial ruling. Sotomayor once again responded that personal experience does not trump the law.\n\nAfter a recess, Senator Feinstein drew a line of support for Sotomayor. Senator Grassley then brought up the issue of gay marriage, and whether the federal government or the states' governments should decide the issue. Sotomayor described the process, but not her own personal opinion on the matter or how she would approach the case. Grassley continued to press on Sotomayor's rulings in multiple cases, with Sotomayor explaining the process of judging involved in each specific case. Senator Cardin was the final Senator to question Sotomayor, and thanked Sotomayor for her service, and for appearing before the Judiciary Committee. Cardin asked about freedom of religion, and the [[separation of church and state in the United States]], to which Sotomayor was supportive of the law involving freedom of religion, and restriction of the states to form their own religion. Recess was called after Senator Cardin finished questioning.\n\n=== Day 4 (July 16) ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2009}}\nOn July 16, 2009, the second round of questioning continued with Senator Jon Kyl. Kyl immediately began asking about the Supreme Court's precedent in the ''Ricci v. DeStefano'' case. Sotomayor stated that the precedent involved \"the city discriminating a certain race\", despite stating that there was no precedent, while originally ruling on the case. Kyl then asked about her statements involving district and circuit courts, in following precedent. Sotomayor then stated that \"when precedent is set [...] they have policy ramifications.\" Senator Dianne Feinstein then began to follow up on questions raised by Senator Kyl. Feinstein also referenced her wise Latina statement, in stating that Feinstein \"would like to put it in the context of women. In asking if she felt she was an inspiration to women, Sotomayor then stated that \"[her] career as a judge ... does serve as an inspiration for others.\" Feinstein then noted that she thinks Sotomayor will be a great Supreme Court Justice.\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham then began his questioning, asking about whether or not the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] was a fundamental right, which Sotomayor agreed. Graham then asked \"What binds you, when it comes to a fundamental right?\" Sotomayor responded by quickly saying, \"The rule of law.\" Graham then asked about abortion rights, in regard to the Puerto Rican Legal Defense Fund. Sotomayor refused to answer the question. Next asked about the death penalty, and a statement she made in the 1980s in opposition to the death penalty. Graham then stated that her stance on the issues is \"left of center.\" Graham then asked if Sotomayor regretted her wise Latina remark, to which Sotomayor stated that \"it was not [her] intention to leave the impression, that people have gotten from [her] words\" about the wise Latina comment.\n\nSenator Amy Klobuchar, then began her questioning, and began by reading positive letters, casting Sotomayor in a positive light. Senator John Cornyn next questioned statements that she had made in speeches, and how they are \"quite different\" from what \"[she] is saying before the committee.\" Sotomayor answered by stating to \"look at [her] record.\" Next asking about gay marriage, and whether that would be making law, or interpreting the law, if the Supreme Court were to rule in favor of gay marriage, and Sotomayor largely attempted to avoid answering the question. Next asking about campaign contributions, and difference of a contribution and a bribe, and referenced President Barack Obama's large amounts of fundraising from private funds, Sotomayor agreed with the statements that Cornyn made about whether or not it was the right of individuals to contribute. Senator Arlen Specter began his questioning, and asked about the number of cases that the Supreme Court hears, to which Sotomayor responded that \"it appears\" the Supreme Court \"has the capacity to hear more cases.\" Specter raised specific court cases, and referenced his previous questions about the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, to which Sotomayor responded in the same fashion as when she had been asked the question before.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/16/AR2009071601817.html|title=Sen.

Coburn then went on to reiterate his earlier questions about abortion, including whether or not ''Roe v. Wade'' overrode the state's positions on abortion, which Sotomayor stated that she did not know, before Coburn stated that it was. Senator Al Franken then began his questioning, and asked why Sotomayor wants to be a Supreme Court justice. Franken then stated that he would in fact be supporting Sotomayor, after she told a story from when she first began her career.\n\nSenator Jeff Sessions next began a third round of questioning, to raise concerns that he had about some of Sotomayor's answers. Sessions then stated that he would not support a Republican filibuster. Third-round questioning continued with Senators Orrin Hatch, Chuck Grassley, Jon Kyl, Lindsey Graham, John Cornyn, Tom Coburn, and Patrick Leahy briefly raising their concerns, and getting short answers from Sotomayor.\n\n==== Witness testimony ====\nWitness testimony began with Kim Askew and Mary Boies, representing the Standing Committee of the [[American Bar Association]], who reviewed Sotomayor as \"highly qualified\".\n\nThe second series of testimonies involved the ''Ricci v.

During her speech, she commented,. \"The task of a judge is not to make the law, it is to apply the law\".<ref name=\"The Hill Day 1\"/> Alexander Bolton of ''The Hill'' attributed such a pledge to [[George W.

Committee Chairman [[Patrick Leahy]] (D-[[Vermont|VT]]) began the session, and largely focused on Sotomayor's judicial record. The nominee took the opportunity to explain her ideals, and described herself as impartial and deferential to precedent, noting \"It's important to remember that, as a job, I don't make law.\" Leahy then concentrated on the \"Tarzan burglar\" case, which Sotomayor prosecuted as assistant district attorney in Manhattan during the early 1980s. Sotomayor tied a series of incidents together and persuaded the trial judge to let her try the burglar on a number of crimes in one case. Leahy also gave Sotomayor the opportunity to explain her ruling in the ''[[Ricci v. DeStefano|Ricci]]'' case, which the Supreme Court overturned after a ruling by a panel of which she was a member. Sotomayor stated that the ruling was based on precedent, and that it would have come out differently in light of the standard subsequently established by the Supreme Court on appeal.<ref>[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2009/07/sotomayor-hearings-leahy-plays-defense-out-of-the-box.html Sotomayor hearings: Leahy plays defense out of the box]</ref>\n\nRanking Republican [[Jeff Sessions]] (R-[[Alabama|AL]]) then began questioning, and notably referenced her \"[[q:Sonia Sotomayor#\"A Latina judge's voice\"|wise Latina]]\" remark.

During one of Sotomayor's answers to Grassley, a protester notably erupted, shouting anti-[[Abortion in the United States|abortion]] statements that accused Sotomayor of being a \"baby killer\" and to \"save the babies.\" Grassley then joked that \"people always say I have the ability to turn people on,\" after the heckler had been taken out of the room and arrested by police.<ref>[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2009/07/sotomayor-hearings-protest-then-a-punch-line.html Sotomayor hearings: A protest \u2013 then a punch line]</ref>\n\nSenator [[Russ Feingold]] (D-WI) then questioned her on \"post-[[September 11 attacks|9/11]] policies,\" as well as her opinions on such cases as the Court's decisions in ''[[Rasul v.

Sotomayor responded by saying that \"[she] wouldn't approach the issue of judging in the way the president does.\" It was the first time that Sotomayor publicly attempted to distance herself from the president. Kyl also again referenced her \"wise Latina\" quote, and she again stated that it was meant to inspire young Latino students. Sotomayor also made clear that \"if you look at my history on the bench, you will know that I do not believe that any ethnic, gender or race group has an advantage in sound judging.\" Senator Leahy defended Sotomayor in the face of ridicule by Senator Kyl.<ref>[http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2009/07/14/20090714kyl-sotomayor14-ON.html Kyl forgoes pleasantries, presses Sotomayor]</ref>\n\nIn asking if Sotomayor felt sympathy for victims in cases that she had ruled on\u2014specifically a case involving a [[TWA Flight 800|TWA airliner which exploded]] off the coast of New York, in which the families of the victims, many poor, attempted to sue the manufacturer to recover some of their losses\u2014Senator [[Charles Schumer]] (D-[[New York (state)|NY]]) noted that \"empathy is the opposite of indifference.\" In a later statement, Schumer said that \"in [Sotomayor's] courtroom the rule of law always triumphs,\" with which Sotomayor agreed.<ref>[http://www.rttnews.com/Content/PoliticalNews.aspx?Node=B1&Id=1004621 Schumer Defends Sotomayor From Bias Claims]</ref>\n\nSotomayor's Latina woman statement was once again quoted up by Senator [[Lindsey Graham]] (R-[[South Carolina|SC]]).

Sotomayor demurred from criticizing Congress and more or less passed on answering. Durbin followed up on his death penalty question emphasizing his concern about courts following up on assuring appeals plaintiffs about [[DNA]] evidence that may have come to light since their convictions, and he also brought up the case of ''[[Ledbetter v.

Cornyn also noted a 1996 quote made by Sotomayor, in which she stated that judges can \"change law\". Sotomayor went on to claim that the statement was taken out of context, and that she was explaining the process of law to the public, and that judges \"can't change law.

Sotomayor stated that voting is a fundamental right, and that the Congress has done a good job in regard to protecting the right to vote. Cardin recognized Sotomayor's achievements at [[Princeton University]], and asked of her opinion of hearing different voices in public schools, as well as steps the federal government could take to further recognize diversity. Sotomayor cited the example of the [[University of Michigan]], which promoted \"as much diversity as possible.\" She also referenced the [[Equal Protection Clause]] under the law. In closing his statement, Cardin finally asked about Sotomayor's opinion on privacy, in terms of technology, and how it should be interpreted under the Constitution, which was \"written in the eighteenth century.\" Sotomayor made it clear that privacy is specifically protected under the Constitution.<ref>[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2009/07/sotomayor-hearings-judicial-temperament-or-temperamental-.html Sotomayor hearings: Judicial temperament \u2013 or temperamental?]</ref>\n\nIn reacting to the outbursts by anti-abortion advocates, Senator [[Tom Coburn]] (R-[[Oklahoma|OK]]) asked numerous questions in regard to abortion under the law.

Sotomayor agreed with Coburn that there is a fundamental and individual right to bear arms under the Second Amendment. Going further, Coburn then inquired about Sotomayor's personal opinion on the right to self-defense, which Sotomayor steadfastly refused to answer according to her own opinion, answering instead by stating that under New York law, facing certain imminent threat, \"you can use force to repel that, and that would be legal.\"<ref>[https://archive.today/20120708002745/http://campaignspot.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MWNlOTE5NzFkOWQ3NDgyMGZkOWNhMmJmZGJhOWMyYmY= Without a Precedent, Sotomayor Has a Hard Time Expressing an Opinion]</ref> Coburn then asked if there was any right to use any foreign law in a judge's rulings in the United States.

Whitehouse then asked about Sotomayor's role in the [[LatinoJustice PRLDEF|Puerto Rican Legal Defense Fund]], inquiring if there was a vetting process in deciding the board members. Sotomayor stated there was none. Whitehouse then went on to ask about search and seizure, as well as the federal government's involvement in warrants, in terms of fighting \"terrorist extremists\". She stated that it was the judge's decision whether a warrant should or should not be issued, based on the evidence presented.<ref>[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2009/07/sotomayor-hearings-thumbs-up-for-the-american-jury-system.html Sotomayor hearings: Thumbs up for the American jury system]</ref>\n\nSenator [[Amy Klobuchar]] (D-[[Minnesota|MN]]) went back to previous statements made by Sotomayor, as to whether rulings should be based on personal feelings or on law. Sotomayor reiterated her statements that she can only \"apply the law\", and not make it. Klobuchar then asked about a child [[pornography]] case, in which a warrant was not properly attained. Sotomayor described that she had sided with the panel, which had ruled that the search was unconstitutional, but the police officers had acted in \"good faith\". Further statements by Klobuchar were very supportive of Sotomayor,<ref>[http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2009/07/13/klobuchar_sotomayor/ Klobuchar: 'I've been very impressed so far']</ref> and noted her sentencings of white collar defendants.<ref>[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2009/07/sotomayor-hearings-finally-moms-take-center-stage.html Sotomayor hearings: Finally, moms take center stage]</ref>\n\nSenator [[Ted Kaufman]] (D-[[Delaware|DE]]) asked about Sotomayor's tenure as a litigator of commercial law cases. Kaufman asked numerous questions about how her commercial practice incorporates itself into her current evaluations and rulings as a judge. Kaufman then referenced a case in which she ruled for legal immunity for the [[New York Stock Exchange]], despite Sotomayor's statement that their \"behavior was egregious\".<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/americasRegulatoryNews/idUSN1534921920090715 US court nominee won't discuss financial regulation]</ref>  Kaufman also asked questions on [[United States antitrust law|antitrust law]], and about how [[economic theory]] related to judicial decisions.<ref>[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2009/07/sotomayor-hearings-talking-business-is-a-bonus-and-a-bore.html Sotomayor hearings: Talking business is a bonus and a bore]</ref>\n\nAfter a brief recess, Senator [[Arlen Specter]] (D-[[Pennsylvania|PA]]) first complimented Sotomayor on her handling of questions during the hearing. Specter then once again brought up the \"wise Latina\" comments, and likened them to similar statements from others currently on the Supreme Court.<ref>[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2009/07/sotomayor-hearings-specter-tries-to-defuse-wise-latina-controversy.html Sotomayor hearings: Arlen Specter tries to defuse 'wise Latina' controversy]</ref> The terror surveillance program was then brought up, with Specter very critical of former President Bush's [[NSA warrantless surveillance controversy|wiretapping of US citizens without warrants]].

Sotomayor stated that she personally allowed television cameras into her courtroom, but conceded that it is up to the justices on the Supreme Court whether to allow it at that level.<ref>[https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2009/07/13/specter-urges-sotomayor-to-allow-tv-cameras-in-the-court/ Specter Urges Sotomayor to Allow TV Cameras in the Court]</ref>\n\nThe newest member of the committee, Senator [[Al Franken]] (D-MN), noted that the \"hearings are a way for Americans to learn about the court, and the impact on their lives.\" He transitioned to free speech in regard to the internet, and noted the value of such tools as [[Twitter]] to convey the [[facts on the ground]] of the recent [[2009 Iranian election protests|Iranian election protests]]. Franken asked about the role of [[Internet service providers]] regarding the issue of [[net neutrality]], in speeding up the provider's own content while slowing down other providers' content. Sotomayor stated that the \"role of the court is to not make the policy, it is to wait until Congress acts.\" Franken further pressed by asking \"Isn't there a compelling, overriding, first amendment right here, for Americans to have access to the internet?\" Sotomayor stated that \"rights are rights, and what the court looks at is how Congress balances those rights in a particular situation, and then judge whether that balance is within constitutional boundaries [...] and then we'll look at that and see if it's constitutional.\"<ref>[http://www.multichannel.com/article/315056-Franken_Will_Raise_Network_Neutrality_With_Sotomayor.php Franken Will Raise Network Neutrality With Sotomayor]</ref><ref>[http://news.gaeatimes.com/specter-likes-sotomayors-record-but-not-her-answers-110459/ Specter likes Sotomayor's record, but not her answers]</ref> Franken asked for the definition of \"judicial activism\", which Sotomayor said was neither descriptive of her nor a term she uses, averring that she does not use labels.<ref>[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2009/07/sotomayor-hearings-franken-talks-mason-and-judicial-activism.html Sotomayor hearings: Franken talks 'Mason' and judicial activism]</ref> Franken notably then pulled out his pocket Constitution, referencing the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] in noting the recent decision to uphold the Voting Rights Act, which Sotomayor declined to speak on because the case was pending a future ruling by the Supreme Court. Franken asked if the words ''birth control'' and ''privacy'' were in the Constitution, in reference to previous Senators' statements on whether or not the word ''abortion'' was in the Constitution. Sotomayor answered that neither of those words is in the Constitution, after which Franken asked if the Constitution was \"at all relevant\" in regard to certain issues, which Sotomayor argued against. Franken finally asked if privacy issues were involved in abortion rights, and Sotomayor agreed.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://campaignspot.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YTFlMmYzMGViZGU0MmFjYzljN2VmNDMyODU5YjZhYTM= |title=Al Franken, Determined to Get to the Bottom of the Perry Mason Controversy |access-date=2009-07-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721064714/http://campaignspot.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YTFlMmYzMGViZGU0MmFjYzljN2VmNDMyODU5YjZhYTM= |archive-date=2009-07-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe committee then adjourned to a closed session to review a [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] background check, which is a part of the regular vetting process. Then, after reconvening, Senator Jeff Sessions began his second round of questioning by bringing up the Puerto Rican Legal Defense Fund, and asked if she had been involved in fundraising. Sotomayor stated that board members serve other functions than fundraising, including \"employment, public health, education, and others.\" Senator Leahy then interjected, and followed up on his concerns over the Second Amendment. Senator Kohl then brought up arguments mentioned by Ted Kaufman in regard to antitrust laws, and Sotomayor responded by stating that she would, at the \"court's precedent, [...] apply it\" to the situation. Kohl then gave a statistic stating that the Supreme Court only hears \"about one percent\" of the cases that are brought before the court. Senator Orrin Hatch gave further arguments about the [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|Doctrine of Incorporation]], and further reviewed Sotomayor's statement of \"fidelity to the law\". Hatch also brought up the right to privacy, and that Sotomayor had stated that the Constitution \"cannot be bent\", and that courts \"can apply the words of the Constitution to the facts of the case before them.\" Hatch next brought up once again the issue of \"empathy\" in judicial ruling. Sotomayor once again responded that personal experience does not trump the law.\n\nAfter a recess, Senator Feinstein drew a line of support for Sotomayor. Senator Grassley then brought up the issue of gay marriage, and whether the federal government or the states' governments should decide the issue. Sotomayor described the process, but not her own personal opinion on the matter or how she would approach the case. Grassley continued to press on Sotomayor's rulings in multiple cases, with Sotomayor explaining the process of judging involved in each specific case. Senator Cardin was the final Senator to question Sotomayor, and thanked Sotomayor for her service, and for appearing before the Judiciary Committee. Cardin asked about freedom of religion, and the [[separation of church and state in the United States]], to which Sotomayor was supportive of the law involving freedom of religion, and restriction of the states to form their own religion. Recess was called after Senator Cardin finished questioning.\n\n=== Day 4 (July 16) ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2009}}\nOn July 16, 2009, the second round of questioning continued with Senator Jon Kyl. Kyl immediately began asking about the Supreme Court's precedent in the ''Ricci v. DeStefano'' case. Sotomayor stated that the precedent involved \"the city discriminating a certain race\", despite stating that there was no precedent, while originally ruling on the case. Kyl then asked about her statements involving district and circuit courts, in following precedent. Sotomayor then stated that \"when precedent is set [...] they have policy ramifications.\" Senator Dianne Feinstein then began to follow up on questions raised by Senator Kyl. Feinstein also referenced her wise Latina statement, in stating that Feinstein \"would like to put it in the context of women. In asking if she felt she was an inspiration to women, Sotomayor then stated that \"[her] career as a judge ... does serve as an inspiration for others.\" Feinstein then noted that she thinks Sotomayor will be a great Supreme Court Justice.\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham then began his questioning, asking about whether or not the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] was a fundamental right, which Sotomayor agreed. Graham then asked \"What binds you, when it comes to a fundamental right?\" Sotomayor responded by quickly saying, \"The rule of law.\" Graham then asked about abortion rights, in regard to the Puerto Rican Legal Defense Fund. Sotomayor refused to answer the question. Next asked about the death penalty, and a statement she made in the 1980s in opposition to the death penalty. Graham then stated that her stance on the issues is \"left of center.\" Graham then asked if Sotomayor regretted her wise Latina remark, to which Sotomayor stated that \"it was not [her] intention to leave the impression, that people have gotten from [her] words\" about the wise Latina comment.\n\nSenator Amy Klobuchar, then began her questioning, and began by reading positive letters, casting Sotomayor in a positive light. Senator John Cornyn next questioned statements that she had made in speeches, and how they are \"quite different\" from what \"[she] is saying before the committee.\" Sotomayor answered by stating to \"look at [her] record.\" Next asking about gay marriage, and whether that would be making law, or interpreting the law, if the Supreme Court were to rule in favor of gay marriage, and Sotomayor largely attempted to avoid answering the question. Next asking about campaign contributions, and difference of a contribution and a bribe, and referenced President Barack Obama's large amounts of fundraising from private funds, Sotomayor agreed with the statements that Cornyn made about whether or not it was the right of individuals to contribute. Senator Arlen Specter began his questioning, and asked about the number of cases that the Supreme Court hears, to which Sotomayor responded that \"it appears\" the Supreme Court \"has the capacity to hear more cases.\" Specter raised specific court cases, and referenced his previous questions about the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, to which Sotomayor responded in the same fashion as when she had been asked the question before.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/16/AR2009071601817.html|title=Sen.

Coburn then went on to reiterate his earlier questions about abortion, including whether or not ''Roe v. Wade'' overrode the state's positions on abortion, which Sotomayor stated that she did not know, before Coburn stated that it was. Senator Al Franken then began his questioning, and asked why Sotomayor wants to be a Supreme Court justice. Franken then stated that he would in fact be supporting Sotomayor, after she told a story from when she first began her career.\n\nSenator Jeff Sessions next began a third round of questioning, to raise concerns that he had about some of Sotomayor's answers. Sessions then stated that he would not support a Republican filibuster. Third-round questioning continued with Senators Orrin Hatch, Chuck Grassley, Jon Kyl, Lindsey Graham, John Cornyn, Tom Coburn, and Patrick Leahy briefly raising their concerns, and getting short answers from Sotomayor.\n\n==== Witness testimony ====\nWitness testimony began with Kim Askew and Mary Boies, representing the Standing Committee of the [[American Bar Association]], who reviewed Sotomayor as \"highly qualified\".\n\nThe second series of testimonies involved the ''Ricci v.

After a year, he is shown to be working for the covert International Contract Agency, or ICA, under his handler Diana Burnwood. He is sent on a mission to eliminate four crime bosses across the world, before being hired to kill a fifth target, Doctor Kovacs, at the sanitarium where 47 was imprisoned. As events transpire, 47 finds out that all his targets were part of an advanced cloning experiment, with him as the result; the perfect assassin. Professor Ort-Meyer, himself the scientific head of the experiments, is revealed to be the client who ordered the hits and, to protect himself, sends a squad of docile, highly trained 48 clones against 47. With help from a fellow agent, 47 defeats the clones and kills Ort-Meyer. In the aftermath of this revelation, 47 tries to leave his assassin past behind (in ''[[Hitman 2: Silent Assassin]]''), seeking peace in a Sicilian monastery, but is forced to become an assassin when his mentor and friend, Father Vittorio, is kidnapped. Getting back in contact with the ICA, he arranges with Diana that he will work for them if they help trace Father Vittorio. Eventually, it is revealed that Father Vittorio's kidnapping was orchestrated by Sergei Zavorotko, the brother of one of the men whose DNA helped create 47, to bring 47 out of retirement and kill everyone who was in on a deal by Zavorotko to purchase a nuclear warhead. 47 successfully infiltrates Father Vittorio's monastery, killing Zavorotko and all his men. Though Father Vittorio begs 47 to lead a good life, the assassin decides to return to the ICA full-time.\n\nA few years later, 47's reputation has spread far and wide with a list of clients requesting his services. After an operation in [[Paris]] [[France]], 47 himself is nearly killed, prompting [[Hitman: Contracts|flashbacks over previous missions]]. In ''[[Hitman: Blood Money]]'', it emerges that the ICA is under attack from a rival agency called the Franchise, who are planting incriminating evidence against 47 through one of their agents, Alexander Leland Cayne. Eventually, the agency is depleted to the point that Diana and 47 are the only ones left. 47 kills one of the two Franchise assassins and is given a final contract by Diana, who has dissolved the ICA, to take down the Franchise. Soon, an old acquaintance of 47, former CIA agent Smith, reveals that the Franchise, planning to assassinate the US president, is merely a puppet organization for Alpha Xerox, a shadowy political organization who wish to monopolize the cloning techniques that gave birth to 47: they wish to kill the President before he can put a halt to their plans. 47 prevents the assassination, but must go into hiding from the Franchise and the police. At his hideout, he is seemingly betrayed and poisoned by Diana, with the Franchise preparing to cremate the assassin so his DNA cannot be used for further cloning experiments. 47's 'death' is later revealed to be a tactic which would bring 47 within killing range of everyone at the funeral, including Franchise agent Cayne. 47, his identity now a secret, goes into hiding and Diana uses the remains of the Franchise to revive the ICA.\n\nYears later, in ''[[Hitman: Absolution]]'', Diana seemingly betrays the ICA, exposing it to the public. When the Agency learns of her betrayal, they send operatives to eliminate her. During a mission, Diana is forced to suddenly abandon 47 when she sees that the Agency operatives are coming for her. Due to her sudden disconnection from him, 47 is nearly killed during the mission and decides to cut contact with the ICA. The Agency is eventually able to locate 47 once again. Benjamin Travis, who is Diana's superior within the Agency, contracts him to kill Diana and bring a girl she has in her care, Victoria, to the Agency. 47 infiltrates Diana's base and shoots her, but promises to keep Victoria safe from the ICA. It is revealed that Victoria is a clone, like 47, created in secret by Travis, whom the ICA would train to be an assassin. Diana did what she did to protect the girl from becoming like 47. The assassin soon comes into conflict with Blake Dexter, the head of Dexter Industries and a top figure in the criminal underworld, who wishes to sell Victoria to the highest bidder. 47 finds himself fighting to keep Victoria safe as she is hunted by Dexter's forces and the ICA. 47 eventually kills Dexter and his conspirators along with Travis and his lieutenants, saving Victoria. At the end, it is revealed that 47 spared Diana and it is implied that she and 47 are once more working for the ICA.\n\nIn ''[[Hitman (2016 video game)|Hitman]]'', the game's prologue reveals 47's recruitment into the ICA and his first meeting with Diana. While Diana is impressed with 47's skills as a silent assassin, training director Erich Soders believes that 47 is too dangerous as they could find nothing on his background check that gives the ICA any leverage over him. Soders rigs 47's final test so that it would be impossible to complete on his own, although Diana learns of Soders plot and in turn assists 47 in completing the test. Though angered by Diana's actions, Soders reluctantly makes 47 an agent and assigns Diana as his handler. Twenty years later, following the events of the previous game, 47 is sent to Paris to eliminate fashion mogul Viktor Novikov and his partner Dahlia Margolis, who are secretly the ring leaders of the international spy ring IAGO. After completing the contract he is sent to Sapienza, [[Italy]] to eliminate the wealthy bioengineer Silvio Caruso and his Head of Lab Francesca DeSantis who both work for the Ether Bio Corporation and to destroy a genetically engineered virus that targets an individual unique DNA signature. Later, 47 is sent to [[Marrakesh]], [[Morocco]] to eliminate Claus Strandberg and General Zeydan, who are planning to overthrow the Moroccan government. A contract is then issued on an assumed murderer, Jordan Cross and his family's lawyer Ken Morgan in [[Bangkok]]. Diana then reveals that there's been a \u201cshadow client\u201d the entire time, operating out of [[Colorado]]. 47 proceeds to eliminate the lieutenants of the shadow client and discovers evidence that he has been using 47 to hunt members of Providence, a group of global elites who rule the world in secret. 47 also discovers that Erich Soders is a Providence double agent. Realizing his betrayal, 47 is sent to Hokkaido to eliminate Soders and another Providence operative, Yuki Yamazaki. The final cutscene of season 1 shows a Providence operative discussing a partnership with the ICA to track down the shadow client.\n\nIn ''[[Hitman 2 (2018 video game)|Hitman 2]]'', 47 is sent to New Zealand to kill Alma Reynard, one of the Shadow Client's lieutenants, and search her house for information on the Shadow Client. 47 receives information connecting CEO of Kronstadt Industries, Robert Knox, and his daughter, Sierra Knox, to the Shadow Client, and Providence, impressed with their work, authorizes them to eliminate the rest of the Shadow Client's militia, as their attacks on CEOs are causing a global panic. 47 is then sent to Miami to kill the Knoxes, who defected from Providence to the Shadow Client after becoming paranoid about the attacks. After they have been eliminated, the Shadow Client is revealed as Lucas Grey, who attempts to fulfill his own plans along with hacktivist Olivia Hall and insists that they need 47's help to take down Providence. 47 is then sent to Colombia to assassinate drug kingpin Rico Delgado and two other members of the infamous Delgado cartel. After the mission, Diana has flashbacks of her parents being killed in a car bombing. It is revealed that the cartel had been creating fake IDs for the Shadow Client's militia, and 47 is sent to Mumbai to find and eliminate The Maelstrom, the Shadow Client's second lieutenant, as well as two other sea pirates that killed a Providence operative. Grey's location is traced to Romania at the facility where 47 was created. 47 encounters Grey, who reveals himself as Subject 6. As children, he and 47 had attempted to escape Dr. Ort-Meyer's facility, but only Grey succeeded, and 47 had his memory wiped. 47 then remembers that he and 6 made a pact that they would take revenge on whoever made them into assassins, and this prompts a meeting between 47, Grey, Diana, and Hall in Berlin. Grey reveals that Ort-Meyer was a member of Providence which is controlled by \"The Constant\" and three families known as \"The Partners\". Grey's only lead on the Constant is that 47 knows the identity of the Constant. After being injected with the antidote to the memory wiping drug, 47 reveals that the first Constant is an ex-KGB spy named Janus who currently resides in a quiet Vermont suburb. Diana then files a false ICA report claiming Janus is the Shadow Client and that Grey is just a subordinate, giving 47 permission to infiltrate the suburban town and kill Janus and his top bodyguard, Nolan Cassidy, and to search for clues about the Constant's whereabouts. While in Vermont, 47 finds evidence Janus and the Constant were planning to meet at an annual gathering held by a group of the global elite known as \"The Ark Society\" that has ties to Providence. Hall reveals that the gathering is being held on the Isle of Sgail in the North Atlantic, but the Constant, revealed as the man who hired Diana at the end of ''[[Hitman (2016 video game)|Hitman]]'', has implanted himself with a suicide chip that releases lethal poison into his body if he is compromised. 47 is then tasked to eliminate Zoe and Sophia Washington, the chairwomen of The Ark Society who hold the kill-switches for the poison chip, and to assist Grey in extracting the Constant from the island. The game leaves off with the Constant revealing the names of the Partner families and by taunting Diana about what she does not know. In a cutscene, it is revealed that 47 was the one contracted with killing Diana's parents.\n\n==Gameplay==\nSet mainly in a third-person perspective, the core objective in each level of the games is to kill assigned targets (usually multiple and sometimes additional targets as an optional bonus). In most cases, ''Hitman'' allows the player different options to accomplish this task. Players can perform precise assassinations or slaughter indiscriminately in order to achieve the mission goals; however, the games reward a subtle approach by awarding special weapons or cash bonuses if players earn a favourable rank (usually achievable by eliminating only the assigned target, and without raising the alarm doing so). 47 can wear a variety of disguises (such as repairmen, police officers and waiters) to fool enemies and gain access to restricted areas. The focus of ''Hitman'' is not hiding in the shadows from the enemy, but rather blending in amongst them. It is up to the player to initiate violence, since guards do not usually open fire unless provoked.\n\nIn every game, the player character, Agent 47, has limited maneuverability; he cannot jump, scale walls, or mantle up ledges (there are a few pre-scripted places where he can jump from one balcony to another, but these are very rare). This generally limits the player to a single plane of movement, although he is often presented the opportunity to move to higher or lower areas through the use of ladders, stairs, elevators, or hills.\n\nAgent 47 is given the ability to hop over minor obstructions in  ''Codename 47'', and other subsequent installments. In the fourth installment, ''Blood Money'', he is now able to climb certain edifices (such as fencing, vines, loose bricks, crates etc.) and is also given with the option of climbing onto the top of elevators through the hatch, allowing the player to strangle a victim from above.\n\nA major feature in the game is the tension meter or \"Suspicion Meter\", detailing how much attention or suspicion the player is receiving from the public or guards and is dependent on many things. For example, walking around in a guard's uniform with the correct corresponding gun will not gather much notice, whereas running around in a waiter's uniform in a restricted area while carrying a visible weapon instead of an appetizer tray will result in an unwanted confrontation with the guards.\n\nThe second game of the series, ''Silent Assassin'', enforced the concept of kills without firing more than a single shot. As per the number of shots fired and stealth used, ratings were given after every mission. The best of these ratings was Silent Assassin, indicating no more than one shot per target (and a guard) with no alerts raised.\n\nIn most cases, 47 is required to hide any dead bodies, to prevent alarms. As introduced in ''Hitman: Blood Money'', 47 can hide a body in a place such as a garbage dump/rubbish bin. Many targets can be assassinated without firing a single shot; this style of gameplay became more prevalent in ''Blood Money'', where the focus was to make some of 47's hits look like accidents. Accidents can be caused remotely with RU-AP mines acting on some (usually heavy and suspended) object, directly by pushing someone over a railing, and by other, more elaborate methods such as:\n* Replacing a World War I replica gun to be used in the opera ''[[Tosca]]'' with a real World War I era pistol.\n* Crushing a man's neck using weights during his morning workout.\n* Rigging a grill to set a victim on fire.\n\n===Methods of assassination===\nThe ''Hitman'' series permits the player to kill targets (or non-targets) in a variety of ways, using firearms, melee weapons, or conventional objects that 47 picks up (such as shovels, fireplace pokers, pool cues, etc.).  In ''Hitman: Contracts'', melee weapons such as knives can be used to kill in more than one method, including forward stabs, horizontal throat slitting, frontal slashes, repeated stabs under the ribcage, or thrusting the blade into the carotid artery.\n\n47 also has a [[garrote]], or fiber wire. The fiber wire is specially made for strangulation, with reinforced handles. He carries it with him on every mission, even those in which he is stripped of all other weaponry. It is also one of the few weapons which can bypass metal detectors.\n\nTo achieve the ideal 'Silent Assassin' rank, it is required that 47 only kills his assigned targets, and few or no other NPCs. The sedative syringes, or chloroform in ''Hitman 2: Silent Assassin'' (which only has a temporary, dose-dependent effect, unlike syringes), exist for this purpose, so that 47 may incapacitate an innocent person to take items or clothing from their body without harming them, so it does not count against the player in the final ranking. In ''Blood Money'', the ability to add sedatives to food and drink was added, to avoid direct confrontation. ''Blood Money'' also introduced the option to hold any NPC hostage using smaller arms and use them as a human shield, and allows the player to knock the hostage unconscious with the gun, saving the player sedatives for food items or any impeding characters that are seated in chairs. In some missions, if a murder can be made to look like accidental death (using the accident system introduced in ''Blood Money''), some kills will not be counted as hits, but as accidents.  Any civilians or armed personnel who witness a kill will count as witnesses, and will harm the player's rank if they remain alive or alert nearby guards. If however, someone (target or civilian) dies because of an accident, it will not matter if there are witnesses. 47 has the option of killing witnesses before they reach a guard, but the unnecessary murder will still count against his rank, unless he kills them with an accident.  Witnesses also include anybody who sees 47 changing disguises or holding a weapon. In the games prior to ''Blood Money'', the only consequence of having witnesses to a crime is that they will seek out police/guards and trigger an alert.\n\nThere are mission-specific options for killing a target in certain levels. Notable examples include locking a target in a sauna to stimulate a heart condition and cause cardiac arrest, poisoning a target's meal (this becomes more widespread in ''Blood Money''), disguising 47 as a doctor and sabotaging a surgical operation, replacing a prop [[Mauser C96]] handgun with a real one at an opera rehearsal, causing an actor to unwittingly kill the target, and causing stage pyrotechnics to explode and set the target on fire.\n\nIn most cases, it is required that 47 also hide the body of killed or unconscious victims, in order to avoid any unwanted alarm or if this is the desired effect 47 can leave the victims body in a wide open space for all to see.\n\n===''Hitman'' insignia===\n\nThe ''Hitman'' insignia, a stylized [[fleur de lis]], appears in ''Hitman: Codename 47'' on the gates of Prof. Dr. Otto Wolfgang Ort-Meyer's asylum, throughout his laboratory and is formed by Ort-Meyer's pool of blood when 47 kills him at the end of the game. It also appears in 'Hitman: Contracts' on the floor of the cloning lab, this time as though it is the actual floor design, as well as on Ort-Meyer's belt buckle. In ''Blood Money'', it appears on books throughout the levels as an [[easter egg (media)|easter egg]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe symbol is engraved on the handles of his custom [[AMT Hardballer]] pistol; they are referred to as 'Silverballers' in ''Hitman: Contracts'', ''Hitman: Blood Money'' and ''Hitman: Absolution''. After ''Hitman: Contracts'', the symbol is on the slides as well. It is also found on 47's equipment such as his laptop, briefcase and cell phone. In the film, 47 wears a pair of silver cufflinks with his insignia enameled in red.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n==Characters==\n* '''[[Agent 47]]''': A genetically-engineered assassin created from the [[recombinant DNA]] of five of the world's most dangerous criminals. The fact that the DNA came from multiple ethnicities allows 47 to blend in to a certain degree in most places in the world, or at least not look immediately suspicious and out-of-place. His name comes from the last two digits of a bar code on the back of his head \u2013 640509-040147. According to Jacob Andersen, lead designer of ''[[Hitman 2: Silent Assassin]]'', Agent 47 went from being \"a mean old hairy guy\" to having \"hi-tech glasses\" before getting to his current design.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamershell.com/articles/488.html |title=Hitman 2 Interview \u2013 ( Review, Preview, Article, Interview, Q&A ) |accessdate=15 October 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304002754/http://www.gamershell.com/articles/488.html |archivedate=4 March 2016 }}</ref> More inspiration came from \"comic books, Hong Kong movies,\" and other similar media.<ref name=\"PC Int.\">{{cite web |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=145880 |title=GamesRadar+ |accessdate=15 October 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919132927/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=145880 |archivedate=19 September 2009}}</ref> According to game director Rasmus H\u00f8jengaard, the idea of a clone whose future is decided by the people that created him, intrigued the ''Hitman'' team.<ref name=\"PC Int.\" /> H\u00f8jengaard felt the idea of creating the \"ultimate assassin\" by cloning \"evolved with the character before the first ''Hitman'' game was done\".<ref name=\"PC Int.\" /> [[David Bateson]] has voiced 47 in every ''Hitman'' game to date.\n* '''Diana Burnwood''': 47's handler at the Agency. Diana briefs 47 on his assignments, oversees his progress, and serves as his guide over the radio. For the vast majority of the series, 47 never sees Diana, recognising her only by voice, however, they do come face-to-face at the conclusion of ''Hitman: Blood Money'' and ''Hitman: Contracts''. Although Diana usually handles 47's affairs from afar, she turns out to be a major character in ''Hitman: Blood Money''; serving as a double agent, faking 47's death, saving the Agency from liquidation, and dodging death herself a few times.<ref>'''Diana:''' You and I are all that's left of the Agency 47, and I doubt I'll last much longer. [[Eidos Interactive]] ''Hitman: Blood Money'' ([[United States]]) 26 May 2006</ref> In the end, her efforts pay off when the Agency is brought back online.<ref>'''Diana:''' Yes, your Majesty, almost all of our resources are online again. ''Hitman: Blood Money'' ([[United States]]) 26 May 2006</ref>  In ''Hitman:  Absolution'', she is shot by 47 in her home after betraying the agency. Although presumed dead, it is later revealed that 47 had only non-lethally wounded Diana, allowing her to fake her own death. She returns as 47's handler with the ICA in [[Hitman (2016 video game)|the 2016 Hitman]] game. She also presumably continues to care for Victoria, a young girl that she and 47 both rescued from the ICA and other captors. In the [[Hitman (2007 film)|2007 Hitman film]], Diana's only form of contact with 47 is through a synthesized voice via laptop. However, she does directly call 47 by phone in order to warn him that the Organization has targeted him. In [[Hitman: Agent 47]], Diana is portrayed by [[Angelababy]]. Diana is voiced by Vivienne McKee from Hitman: Codename 47 until Hitman: Blood Money, Marsha Thomason in Hitman: Absolution and Jane Perry in Hitman\u2122.\n* '''Agent Carlton Smith''': A fairly inept American [[CIA]] agent with ties to the Agency. He has a tendency to be captured and [[torture]]d by the people he has been assigned to spy on. As a result, the Agency has sent 47 to rescue him on a number of occasions. His torture experiences have caused him to take up drinking on the job, making him even more ineffective. Like 47, Agent Smith dons a variety of disguises, but most often he's seen beaten and stripped down to his American Flag [[boxer shorts]]. He seems to regard 47 as a friend, no doubt because 47 has rescued him so many times.  The feeling is not mutual. 47 initially treats his relationship with Agent Smith as detached and professional, but as he is forced to rescue Smith again and again, he increasingly sees Smith as a hindrance. In ''Hitman: Blood Money'', 47 puts a gun to Smith's head and threatens to kill him, but in the end didn't as Smith provides him a job which will then lead to the White House assassination. Smith's appearance changes somewhat in ''Hitman: Blood Money'', having lost most of his hair through long term alcoholism and depression. In the [[Hitman (2007 film)|Hitman film]], Smith is instead portrayed as a very competent and dutiful CIA agent. In return for assassinating a high priority CIA target (Udre Belicoff, the brother of 47's original target), Smith helps 47 elude arrest by [[Interpol]].\n* '''Mei-Ling''': A young woman from the Chinese mainland, abducted and recruited into the brothel of Hong Kong crime lord Lee Hong. 47 rescues her in exchange for information about her employer in preparation for assassinating him.<ref>'''Mei Ling:''' You foreigner. Then you understand. Listen, you have to help me, please. They kidnapped me and then they brought me here... [...] First you have to get me out of here and then the combination is yours.

[[Eidos Interactive]] ''Hitman 2: Silent Assassin'' 10 January 2002 (''[[United States|US]]'')</ref> Mei-Ling is apparently the first woman who has ever kissed 47; his reaction is different in the original game from the remake. In the original ''Hitman: Codename 47'', 47 reacts with significant revulsion.  In the remake ''Hitman: Contracts'', his reaction is one of detached bemusement. She was known as Lei Ling in the original game.\n* '''Dr. Otto Wolfgang Ort-Meyer''': 47's creator and the ultimate antagonist of ''Hitman: Codename 47''. A brilliant but unhinged individual ostracized by the scientific community for his radical theories on genetic manipulation, Ort-Meyer ran a sophisticated lab hidden beneath a Romanian asylum. There he labored on DNA splicing in an effort to create a flawless human being. He took a great part in raising and indoctrinating 47 at the asylum, where 47 was kept a prisoner until he matured. Ort-Meyer eventually engineered 47's \"escape\" from the asylum in order to test his performance in the real world. The consummate megalomaniac, Ort-Meyer contracted with the Agency to have 47 kill the other 4 men behind the Hitman Project (47's \"fathers\"), so that Ort-Meyer could enjoy the fruits of his labor by himself. Ort-Meyer then attempted to lure 47 to his death, having perfected \"No. 48\", an improved, mindlessly loyal clone. However, Ort-Meyer underestimated how far 47 had advanced. In the final showdown, 47 slaughtered 48 and the clones, then killed Ort-Meyer himself by snapping his neck.\n\n==Games==\nAs of 2019, seven games had been released, all of them developed by [[IO Interactive]].

(2000)====\n{{main|Hitman: Codename 47}}\nThe first installment in the ''Hitman'' series revolves around a test subject known as 47 escaping the asylum where he had been experimented on all his life and being employed by the Agency. 47 meets his handler, Diana Burnwood, who assigns him to kill four criminal masterminds and then a doctor who is revealed to be the one who treated 47 at the asylum. 47 learns that he is a clone who has been trained since birth to become an assassin. The four criminal masterminds that 47 killed were part of the cloning experiment and their deaths were ordered by Professor Wolfgang Ort-Meyer, the one behind the entire cloning process. Ort-Meyer planned 47's escape, so he could have 47 kill the other four associates and use 47 for his own purposes. 47, with the help of a CIA agent named Carlton Smith, returns to the asylum and plans to kill his creator. Ort-Meyer, having prepared for 47's return, sends his group of clones to kill 47. The clones fail their duties and 47 confronts Ort-Meyer. 47 shoots Ort-Meyer, then snaps his neck, killing him.\n\n====''Hitman 2: Silent Assassin'' (2002)====\n{{main|Hitman 2: Silent Assassin}}\nAfter murdering Dr. Ort-Meyer, Agent 47 has faked his death and unofficially resigned from the ICA, leaving behind his life as an assassin, and retreated to a church in Sicily to seek peace. He works as a gardener for Father Vittorio, his best friend and mentor. 47 attends a confession to admit his sins, but Vittorio understands and believes 47 is decent at heart.\n\nOne day, while 47 is working in a garden, Father Vittorio is kidnapped and a ransom note is left for 47. 47 decides to go back to his old job as an assassin to track down Father Vittorio. He contacts his agency, who thought he was dead, and makes a deal with his handler, Diana Burnwood. He states that he will return to his post as an ICA assassin if the agency can help him locate Father Vittorio. They accept the deal.\n\nDiana informs 47 that Father Vittorio was kidnapped by a Sicilian Mafia boss named Giuseppe Giuliano. The man is holding the priest in a cell under his mansion, dubbed Villa Borghese. 47 infiltrates and kills Giuliano, but fails to find Vittorio. 47 is later told by Diana, that a satellite image shows Father Vittorio being taken away by 'Russian-looking types in uniform'.\n\n47 works with the Agency to repay their attempt to find Vittorio, and eventually saves him. As 47 realizes that he cannot find inner peace, 47 leaves the church and narrates that he can never retire in safety and must return to his life as an assassin.\n\n====''Hitman: Contracts'' (2004)====\n{{main|Hitman: Contracts}}\nThe game begins with a cutscene showing a wounded [[Agent 47]] wandering through a dark hotel corridor and entering his room. He collapses and begins to have flashbacks regarding previous assassinations he committed, beginning with the aftermath of killing [[Dr. Otto Wolfgang Ort-Meyer|Dr. Ort-Meyer]] at the end of the [[Hitman: Codename 47|first Hitman game]]. The missions are primarily focused on replays of previous missions in the original game, except played in reverse. The graphics, maps and artificial intelligence have been customized and improved. In the game, 47 visits several locations, including [[Romania]], [[Kamchatka]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Rotterdam]], [[Budapest]], [[Hong Kong]], and finally [[Paris]].\n\n====''Hitman: Blood Money'' (2006)====\n{{main|Hitman: Blood Money}}\nEach mission is framed around the killing of one or more individuals, which the main protagonist, Agent 47 must accomplish. Standing between him and success are armed guards, security checkpoints, possible witnesses and other obstacles. The player guides 47 through the game's levels with the help of a satellite map which can be accessed at any time. The map indicates the layout of each topographical area of the level, the whereabouts of 47 's main targets, and other AI-controlled characters. In order to carry out his mission, 47 may use any method at his disposal to eliminate his targets, regardless of witnesses or violence done to bystanders. Beyond rewarding stealth over bloodshed as is traditional in the series, ''Blood Money'' includes features that directly penalize the player for making too much noise and/or being too violent; either toward their targets, bystanders, or both.\n\n====''Hitman: Absolution'' (2012)====\n{{main|Hitman: Absolution}}\n''Hitman: Absolution'' was announced by [[Square Enix]] and it was released on 20 November 2012 worldwide for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[OS X]], [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]].<ref name=\"hitman5_news\">{{cite web |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/ps3/action/hitman5/news.html?sid=6179961&mode=all |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130124070324/http://uk.gamespot.com/ps3/action/hitman5/news.html?sid=6179961&mode=all |url-status=dead |archive-date=24 January 2013 |title=SCi reveals new Hitman |publisher=Gamespot UK |date=27 September 2007 |accessdate=16 December 2008 }}</ref><ref name=\"hitman5\">{{cite web |url=http://miranda.hemscott.com/ir/seg/pdf/AnnualReport07.pdf |title=Page 17 of SCi Entertainment Group Plc Annual Report 2007 |publisher=SCi Entertainment Group Plc |accessdate=6 February 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105214640/http://miranda.hemscott.com/ir/seg/pdf/AnnualReport07.pdf |archivedate=5 November 2015 }}</ref><ref name=\"hitman_mag_scan\">{{cite web |url=http://img525.imageshack.us/img525/9283/secretgames4ol6uy9.jpg |title=Magazine scan of Hitman: Absolution reveal |publisher=Xbox World |date=9 December 2007 |accessdate=16 December 2008 |format=JPG |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717092040/http://img525.imageshack.us/img525/9283/secretgames4ol6uy9.jpg |archivedate=17 July 2011}}</ref> The fifth installation in the series offers a few different angles from which to observe surroundings.\n\n====''Hitman'' (2016)====\n{{main|Hitman (2016 video game)}}\nA new ''Hitman'' game was originally to be developed by [[Square Enix]] developer Square Enix Montreal, a newly established studio.<ref>{{cite web |last=Lund |first=Karsten |date=25 October 2012 |url=http://gamasutra.com/blogs/KarstenLund/20121025/179479/The_Future_Hitman_Game_on_a_Postit_Square_Enix_Montral.php |title=The Future Hitman Game, on a Post-it: Square Enix Montr\u00e9al |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |accessdate=11 August 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022155821/http://gamasutra.com/blogs/KarstenLund/20121025/179479/The_Future_Hitman_Game_on_a_Postit_Square_Enix_Montral.php |archivedate=22 October 2013}}</ref> However, due to cutbacks and [[layoff]]s at IO Interactive, a Square Enix representative said that IO Interactive will only focus on the ''Hitman'' franchise in the future.<ref>{{cite web |last=Nath |first=Debabrata |date=17 June 2013 |url=http://www.vg247.com/2013/06/17/hitman-studio-faces-lay-off-nearly-half-of-the-staff-lose-jobs/ |title=Hitman studio face lay-offs, nearly half of the staff lose jobs |publisher=[[VG247]] |accessdate=11 August 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824000242/http://www.vg247.com/2013/06/17/hitman-studio-faces-lay-off-nearly-half-of-the-staff-lose-jobs/ |archivedate=24 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Cowan |first=Danny |date=17 June 2013 |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2013/06/17/report-io-interactive-cancels-projects-loses-half-of-staff-to/ |title=Report: IO Interactive cancels projects, loses half of staff to layoffs |publisher=[[Joystiq]] |accessdate=11 August 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728110516/http://www.joystiq.com/2013/06/17/report-io-interactive-cancels-projects-loses-half-of-staff-to |archivedate=28 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Matulef |first=Jeffrey |date=17 June 2013 |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-06-17-io-interactive-lays-off-nearly-half-its-staff |title=IO Interactive cancels everything that isn't Hitman, including Kane & Lynch |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |accessdate=11 August 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820045305/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-06-17-io-interactive-lays-off-nearly-half-its-staff |archivedate=20 August 2013}}</ref>{{clarify|reason=This paragraph makes no sense.

Another film, ''[[Hitman: Agent 47]]'' was released in 2015, also to negative reviews.\n\nThe games revolve around [[Agent 47]], a cloned [[contract killer]], whose flawless record places him in high demand among the wealthy and elite, as he assassinates numerous high-profile criminals across the globe. The first original scriptwriter was Morten Iversen, who wrote the scripts for ''Hitman: Codename 47'' and ''Hitman 2: Silent Assassin''. He also contributed to ''Hitman: Contracts'' and ''Hitman: Blood Money''. The games feature a mix of orchestral and [[electronica]] musical scores, composed by [[Jesper Kyd]].

After a year, he is shown to be working for the covert International Contract Agency, or ICA, under his handler Diana Burnwood. He is sent on a mission to eliminate four crime bosses across the world, before being hired to kill a fifth target, Doctor Kovacs, at the sanitarium where 47 was imprisoned. As events transpire, 47 finds out that all his targets were part of an advanced cloning experiment, with him as the result; the perfect assassin. Professor Ort-Meyer, himself the scientific head of the experiments, is revealed to be the client who ordered the hits and, to protect himself, sends a squad of docile, highly trained 48 clones against 47. With help from a fellow agent, 47 defeats the clones and kills Ort-Meyer. In the aftermath of this revelation, 47 tries to leave his assassin past behind (in ''[[Hitman 2: Silent Assassin]]''), seeking peace in a Sicilian monastery, but is forced to become an assassin when his mentor and friend, Father Vittorio, is kidnapped. Getting back in contact with the ICA, he arranges with Diana that he will work for them if they help trace Father Vittorio. Eventually, it is revealed that Father Vittorio's kidnapping was orchestrated by Sergei Zavorotko, the brother of one of the men whose DNA helped create 47, to bring 47 out of retirement and kill everyone who was in on a deal by Zavorotko to purchase a nuclear warhead. 47 successfully infiltrates Father Vittorio's monastery, killing Zavorotko and all his men. Though Father Vittorio begs 47 to lead a good life, the assassin decides to return to the ICA full-time.\n\nA few years later, 47's reputation has spread far and wide with a list of clients requesting his services. After an operation in [[Paris]] [[France]], 47 himself is nearly killed, prompting [[Hitman: Contracts|flashbacks over previous missions]]. In ''[[Hitman: Blood Money]]'', it emerges that the ICA is under attack from a rival agency called the Franchise, who are planting incriminating evidence against 47 through one of their agents, Alexander Leland Cayne. Eventually, the agency is depleted to the point that Diana and 47 are the only ones left. 47 kills one of the two Franchise assassins and is given a final contract by Diana, who has dissolved the ICA, to take down the Franchise. Soon, an old acquaintance of 47, former CIA agent Smith, reveals that the Franchise, planning to assassinate the US president, is merely a puppet organization for Alpha Xerox, a shadowy political organization who wish to monopolize the cloning techniques that gave birth to 47: they wish to kill the President before he can put a halt to their plans. 47 prevents the assassination, but must go into hiding from the Franchise and the police. At his hideout, he is seemingly betrayed and poisoned by Diana, with the Franchise preparing to cremate the assassin so his DNA cannot be used for further cloning experiments. 47's 'death' is later revealed to be a tactic which would bring 47 within killing range of everyone at the funeral, including Franchise agent Cayne. 47, his identity now a secret, goes into hiding and Diana uses the remains of the Franchise to revive the ICA.\n\nYears later, in ''[[Hitman: Absolution]]'', Diana seemingly betrays the ICA, exposing it to the public. When the Agency learns of her betrayal, they send operatives to eliminate her. During a mission, Diana is forced to suddenly abandon 47 when she sees that the Agency operatives are coming for her. Due to her sudden disconnection from him, 47 is nearly killed during the mission and decides to cut contact with the ICA. The Agency is eventually able to locate 47 once again. Benjamin Travis, who is Diana's superior within the Agency, contracts him to kill Diana and bring a girl she has in her care, Victoria, to the Agency. 47 infiltrates Diana's base and shoots her, but promises to keep Victoria safe from the ICA. It is revealed that Victoria is a clone, like 47, created in secret by Travis, whom the ICA would train to be an assassin. Diana did what she did to protect the girl from becoming like 47. The assassin soon comes into conflict with Blake Dexter, the head of Dexter Industries and a top figure in the criminal underworld, who wishes to sell Victoria to the highest bidder. 47 finds himself fighting to keep Victoria safe as she is hunted by Dexter's forces and the ICA. 47 eventually kills Dexter and his conspirators along with Travis and his lieutenants, saving Victoria. At the end, it is revealed that 47 spared Diana and it is implied that she and 47 are once more working for the ICA.\n\nIn ''[[Hitman (2016 video game)|Hitman]]'', the game's prologue reveals 47's recruitment into the ICA and his first meeting with Diana. While Diana is impressed with 47's skills as a silent assassin, training director Erich Soders believes that 47 is too dangerous as they could find nothing on his background check that gives the ICA any leverage over him. Soders rigs 47's final test so that it would be impossible to complete on his own, although Diana learns of Soders plot and in turn assists 47 in completing the test. Though angered by Diana's actions, Soders reluctantly makes 47 an agent and assigns Diana as his handler. Twenty years later, following the events of the previous game, 47 is sent to Paris to eliminate fashion mogul Viktor Novikov and his partner Dahlia Margolis, who are secretly the ring leaders of the international spy ring IAGO. After completing the contract he is sent to Sapienza, [[Italy]] to eliminate the wealthy bioengineer Silvio Caruso and his Head of Lab Francesca DeSantis who both work for the Ether Bio Corporation and to destroy a genetically engineered virus that targets an individual unique DNA signature. Later, 47 is sent to [[Marrakesh]], [[Morocco]] to eliminate Claus Strandberg and General Zeydan, who are planning to overthrow the Moroccan government. A contract is then issued on an assumed murderer, Jordan Cross and his family's lawyer Ken Morgan in [[Bangkok]]. Diana then reveals that there's been a \u201cshadow client\u201d the entire time, operating out of [[Colorado]]. 47 proceeds to eliminate the lieutenants of the shadow client and discovers evidence that he has been using 47 to hunt members of Providence, a group of global elites who rule the world in secret. 47 also discovers that Erich Soders is a Providence double agent. Realizing his betrayal, 47 is sent to Hokkaido to eliminate Soders and another Providence operative, Yuki Yamazaki. The final cutscene of season 1 shows a Providence operative discussing a partnership with the ICA to track down the shadow client.\n\nIn ''[[Hitman 2 (2018 video game)|Hitman 2]]'', 47 is sent to New Zealand to kill Alma Reynard, one of the Shadow Client's lieutenants, and search her house for information on the Shadow Client. 47 receives information connecting CEO of Kronstadt Industries, Robert Knox, and his daughter, Sierra Knox, to the Shadow Client, and Providence, impressed with their work, authorizes them to eliminate the rest of the Shadow Client's militia, as their attacks on CEOs are causing a global panic. 47 is then sent to Miami to kill the Knoxes, who defected from Providence to the Shadow Client after becoming paranoid about the attacks. After they have been eliminated, the Shadow Client is revealed as Lucas Grey, who attempts to fulfill his own plans along with hacktivist Olivia Hall and insists that they need 47's help to take down Providence. 47 is then sent to Colombia to assassinate drug kingpin Rico Delgado and two other members of the infamous Delgado cartel. After the mission, Diana has flashbacks of her parents being killed in a car bombing. It is revealed that the cartel had been creating fake IDs for the Shadow Client's militia, and 47 is sent to Mumbai to find and eliminate The Maelstrom, the Shadow Client's second lieutenant, as well as two other sea pirates that killed a Providence operative. Grey's location is traced to Romania at the facility where 47 was created. 47 encounters Grey, who reveals himself as Subject 6. As children, he and 47 had attempted to escape Dr. Ort-Meyer's facility, but only Grey succeeded, and 47 had his memory wiped. 47 then remembers that he and 6 made a pact that they would take revenge on whoever made them into assassins, and this prompts a meeting between 47, Grey, Diana, and Hall in Berlin. Grey reveals that Ort-Meyer was a member of Providence which is controlled by \"The Constant\" and three families known as \"The Partners\". Grey's only lead on the Constant is that 47 knows the identity of the Constant. After being injected with the antidote to the memory wiping drug, 47 reveals that the first Constant is an ex-KGB spy named Janus who currently resides in a quiet Vermont suburb. Diana then files a false ICA report claiming Janus is the Shadow Client and that Grey is just a subordinate, giving 47 permission to infiltrate the suburban town and kill Janus and his top bodyguard, Nolan Cassidy, and to search for clues about the Constant's whereabouts. While in Vermont, 47 finds evidence Janus and the Constant were planning to meet at an annual gathering held by a group of the global elite known as \"The Ark Society\" that has ties to Providence. Hall reveals that the gathering is being held on the Isle of Sgail in the North Atlantic, but the Constant, revealed as the man who hired Diana at the end of ''[[Hitman (2016 video game)|Hitman]]'', has implanted himself with a suicide chip that releases lethal poison into his body if he is compromised. 47 is then tasked to eliminate Zoe and Sophia Washington, the chairwomen of The Ark Society who hold the kill-switches for the poison chip, and to assist Grey in extracting the Constant from the island. The game leaves off with the Constant revealing the names of the Partner families and by taunting Diana about what she does not know. In a cutscene, it is revealed that 47 was the one contracted with killing Diana's parents.\n\n==Gameplay==\nSet mainly in a third-person perspective, the core objective in each level of the games is to kill assigned targets (usually multiple and sometimes additional targets as an optional bonus). In most cases, ''Hitman'' allows the player different options to accomplish this task. Players can perform precise assassinations or slaughter indiscriminately in order to achieve the mission goals; however, the games reward a subtle approach by awarding special weapons or cash bonuses if players earn a favourable rank (usually achievable by eliminating only the assigned target, and without raising the alarm doing so). 47 can wear a variety of disguises (such as repairmen, police officers and waiters) to fool enemies and gain access to restricted areas. The focus of ''Hitman'' is not hiding in the shadows from the enemy, but rather blending in amongst them. It is up to the player to initiate violence, since guards do not usually open fire unless provoked.\n\nIn every game, the player character, Agent 47, has limited maneuverability; he cannot jump, scale walls, or mantle up ledges (there are a few pre-scripted places where he can jump from one balcony to another, but these are very rare). This generally limits the player to a single plane of movement, although he is often presented the opportunity to move to higher or lower areas through the use of ladders, stairs, elevators, or hills.\n\nAgent 47 is given the ability to hop over minor obstructions in  ''Codename 47'', and other subsequent installments. In the fourth installment, ''Blood Money'', he is now able to climb certain edifices (such as fencing, vines, loose bricks, crates etc.) and is also given with the option of climbing onto the top of elevators through the hatch, allowing the player to strangle a victim from above.\n\nA major feature in the game is the tension meter or \"Suspicion Meter\", detailing how much attention or suspicion the player is receiving from the public or guards and is dependent on many things. For example, walking around in a guard's uniform with the correct corresponding gun will not gather much notice, whereas running around in a waiter's uniform in a restricted area while carrying a visible weapon instead of an appetizer tray will result in an unwanted confrontation with the guards.\n\nThe second game of the series, ''Silent Assassin'', enforced the concept of kills without firing more than a single shot. As per the number of shots fired and stealth used, ratings were given after every mission. The best of these ratings was Silent Assassin, indicating no more than one shot per target (and a guard) with no alerts raised.\n\nIn most cases, 47 is required to hide any dead bodies, to prevent alarms. As introduced in ''Hitman: Blood Money'', 47 can hide a body in a place such as a garbage dump/rubbish bin. Many targets can be assassinated without firing a single shot; this style of gameplay became more prevalent in ''Blood Money'', where the focus was to make some of 47's hits look like accidents. Accidents can be caused remotely with RU-AP mines acting on some (usually heavy and suspended) object, directly by pushing someone over a railing, and by other, more elaborate methods such as:\n* Replacing a World War I replica gun to be used in the opera ''[[Tosca]]'' with a real World War I era pistol.\n* Crushing a man's neck using weights during his morning workout.\n* Rigging a grill to set a victim on fire.\n\n===Methods of assassination===\nThe ''Hitman'' series permits the player to kill targets (or non-targets) in a variety of ways, using firearms, melee weapons, or conventional objects that 47 picks up (such as shovels, fireplace pokers, pool cues, etc.).  In ''Hitman: Contracts'', melee weapons such as knives can be used to kill in more than one method, including forward stabs, horizontal throat slitting, frontal slashes, repeated stabs under the ribcage, or thrusting the blade into the carotid artery.\n\n47 also has a [[garrote]], or fiber wire. The fiber wire is specially made for strangulation, with reinforced handles. He carries it with him on every mission, even those in which he is stripped of all other weaponry. It is also one of the few weapons which can bypass metal detectors.\n\nTo achieve the ideal 'Silent Assassin' rank, it is required that 47 only kills his assigned targets, and few or no other NPCs. The sedative syringes, or chloroform in ''Hitman 2: Silent Assassin'' (which only has a temporary, dose-dependent effect, unlike syringes), exist for this purpose, so that 47 may incapacitate an innocent person to take items or clothing from their body without harming them, so it does not count against the player in the final ranking. In ''Blood Money'', the ability to add sedatives to food and drink was added, to avoid direct confrontation. ''Blood Money'' also introduced the option to hold any NPC hostage using smaller arms and use them as a human shield, and allows the player to knock the hostage unconscious with the gun, saving the player sedatives for food items or any impeding characters that are seated in chairs. In some missions, if a murder can be made to look like accidental death (using the accident system introduced in ''Blood Money''), some kills will not be counted as hits, but as accidents.  Any civilians or armed personnel who witness a kill will count as witnesses, and will harm the player's rank if they remain alive or alert nearby guards. If however, someone (target or civilian) dies because of an accident, it will not matter if there are witnesses. 47 has the option of killing witnesses before they reach a guard, but the unnecessary murder will still count against his rank, unless he kills them with an accident.  Witnesses also include anybody who sees 47 changing disguises or holding a weapon. In the games prior to ''Blood Money'', the only consequence of having witnesses to a crime is that they will seek out police/guards and trigger an alert.\n\nThere are mission-specific options for killing a target in certain levels. Notable examples include locking a target in a sauna to stimulate a heart condition and cause cardiac arrest, poisoning a target's meal (this becomes more widespread in ''Blood Money''), disguising 47 as a doctor and sabotaging a surgical operation, replacing a prop [[Mauser C96]] handgun with a real one at an opera rehearsal, causing an actor to unwittingly kill the target, and causing stage pyrotechnics to explode and set the target on fire.\n\nIn most cases, it is required that 47 also hide the body of killed or unconscious victims, in order to avoid any unwanted alarm or if this is the desired effect 47 can leave the victims body in a wide open space for all to see.\n\n===''Hitman'' insignia===\n\nThe ''Hitman'' insignia, a stylized [[fleur de lis]], appears in ''Hitman: Codename 47'' on the gates of Prof. Dr. Otto Wolfgang Ort-Meyer's asylum, throughout his laboratory and is formed by Ort-Meyer's pool of blood when 47 kills him at the end of the game. It also appears in 'Hitman: Contracts' on the floor of the cloning lab, this time as though it is the actual floor design, as well as on Ort-Meyer's belt buckle. In ''Blood Money'', it appears on books throughout the levels as an [[easter egg (media)|easter egg]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe symbol is engraved on the handles of his custom [[AMT Hardballer]] pistol; they are referred to as 'Silverballers' in ''Hitman: Contracts'', ''Hitman: Blood Money'' and ''Hitman: Absolution''. After ''Hitman: Contracts'', the symbol is on the slides as well. It is also found on 47's equipment such as his laptop, briefcase and cell phone. In the film, 47 wears a pair of silver cufflinks with his insignia enameled in red.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n==Characters==\n* '''[[Agent 47]]''': A genetically-engineered assassin created from the [[recombinant DNA]] of five of the world's most dangerous criminals. The fact that the DNA came from multiple ethnicities allows 47 to blend in to a certain degree in most places in the world, or at least not look immediately suspicious and out-of-place. His name comes from the last two digits of a bar code on the back of his head \u2013 640509-040147. According to Jacob Andersen, lead designer of ''[[Hitman 2: Silent Assassin]]'', Agent 47 went from being \"a mean old hairy guy\" to having \"hi-tech glasses\" before getting to his current design.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamershell.com/articles/488.html |title=Hitman 2 Interview \u2013 ( Review, Preview, Article, Interview, Q&A ) |accessdate=15 October 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304002754/http://www.gamershell.com/articles/488.html |archivedate=4 March 2016 }}</ref> More inspiration came from \"comic books, Hong Kong movies,\" and other similar media.<ref name=\"PC Int.\">{{cite web |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=145880 |title=GamesRadar+ |accessdate=15 October 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919132927/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=145880 |archivedate=19 September 2009}}</ref> According to game director Rasmus H\u00f8jengaard, the idea of a clone whose future is decided by the people that created him, intrigued the ''Hitman'' team.<ref name=\"PC Int.\" /> H\u00f8jengaard felt the idea of creating the \"ultimate assassin\" by cloning \"evolved with the character before the first ''Hitman'' game was done\".<ref name=\"PC Int.\" /> [[David Bateson]] has voiced 47 in every ''Hitman'' game to date.\n* '''Diana Burnwood''': 47's handler at the Agency. Diana briefs 47 on his assignments, oversees his progress, and serves as his guide over the radio. For the vast majority of the series, 47 never sees Diana, recognising her only by voice, however, they do come face-to-face at the conclusion of ''Hitman: Blood Money'' and ''Hitman: Contracts''. Although Diana usually handles 47's affairs from afar, she turns out to be a major character in ''Hitman: Blood Money''; serving as a double agent, faking 47's death, saving the Agency from liquidation, and dodging death herself a few times.<ref>'''Diana:''' You and I are all that's left of the Agency 47, and I doubt I'll last much longer.

Although presumed dead, it is later revealed that 47 had only non-lethally wounded Diana, allowing her to fake her own death. She returns as 47's handler with the ICA in [[Hitman (2016 video game)|the 2016 Hitman]] game. She also presumably continues to care for Victoria, a young girl that she and 47 both rescued from the ICA and other captors. In the [[Hitman (2007 film)|2007 Hitman film]], Diana's only form of contact with 47 is through a synthesized voice via laptop. However, she does directly call 47 by phone in order to warn him that the Organization has targeted him. In [[Hitman: Agent 47]], Diana is portrayed by [[Angelababy]]. Diana is voiced by Vivienne McKee from Hitman: Codename 47 until Hitman: Blood Money, Marsha Thomason in Hitman: Absolution and Jane Perry in Hitman\u2122.\n* '''Agent Carlton Smith''': A fairly inept American [[CIA]] agent with ties to the Agency. He has a tendency to be captured and [[torture]]d by the people he has been assigned to spy on. As a result, the Agency has sent 47 to rescue him on a number of occasions. His torture experiences have caused him to take up drinking on the job, making him even more ineffective. Like 47, Agent Smith dons a variety of disguises, but most often he's seen beaten and stripped down to his American Flag [[boxer shorts]]. He seems to regard 47 as a friend, no doubt because 47 has rescued him so many times.  The feeling is not mutual. 47 initially treats his relationship with Agent Smith as detached and professional, but as he is forced to rescue Smith again and again, he increasingly sees Smith as a hindrance. In ''Hitman: Blood Money'', 47 puts a gun to Smith's head and threatens to kill him, but in the end didn't as Smith provides him a job which will then lead to the White House assassination. Smith's appearance changes somewhat in ''Hitman: Blood Money'', having lost most of his hair through long term alcoholism and depression. In the [[Hitman (2007 film)|Hitman film]], Smith is instead portrayed as a very competent and dutiful CIA agent. In return for assassinating a high priority CIA target (Udre Belicoff, the brother of 47's original target), Smith helps 47 elude arrest by [[Interpol]].\n* '''Mei-Ling''': A young woman from the Chinese mainland, abducted and recruited into the brothel of Hong Kong crime lord Lee Hong. 47 rescues her in exchange for information about her employer in preparation for assassinating him.<ref>'''Mei Ling:''' You foreigner. Then you understand. Listen, you have to help me, please. They kidnapped me and then they brought me here... [...] First you have to get me out of here and then the combination is yours. [[Eidos Interactive]] ''Hitman: Contracts'' 20 April 2004 (''[[United States|US]]'')</ref> After escaping from Lee Hong, Mei-Ling is later revealed to be prostituting herself to Hayamoto, another [[Asia]]n crime lord.  47 ends up rescuing her again (much to his consternation).<ref>'''47:''' Still living a lousy life I see. I save you from Lee Hong and his Triad outfit in Hong Kong, and first thing after that mess, you're in it with another hotshot crimelord! '''Mei Ling:''' Well, I don't mind. The hours are short and the pay is good. But he is just an old rich bastard and I am bored now. [[Eidos Interactive]] ''Hitman 2: Silent Assassin'' 10 January 2002 (''[[United States|US]]'')</ref> Mei-Ling is apparently the first woman who has ever kissed 47; his reaction is different in the original game from the remake. In the original ''Hitman: Codename 47'', 47 reacts with significant revulsion.  In the remake ''Hitman: Contracts'', his reaction is one of detached bemusement. She was known as Lei Ling in the original game.\n* '''Dr. Otto Wolfgang Ort-Meyer''': 47's creator and the ultimate antagonist of ''Hitman: Codename 47''. A brilliant but unhinged individual ostracized by the scientific community for his radical theories on genetic manipulation, Ort-Meyer ran a sophisticated lab hidden beneath a Romanian asylum. There he labored on DNA splicing in an effort to create a flawless human being. He took a great part in raising and indoctrinating 47 at the asylum, where 47 was kept a prisoner until he matured. Ort-Meyer eventually engineered 47's \"escape\" from the asylum in order to test his performance in the real world. The consummate megalomaniac, Ort-Meyer contracted with the Agency to have 47 kill the other 4 men behind the Hitman Project (47's \"fathers\"), so that Ort-Meyer could enjoy the fruits of his labor by himself. Ort-Meyer then attempted to lure 47 to his death, having perfected \"No. 48\", an improved, mindlessly loyal clone. However, Ort-Meyer underestimated how far 47 had advanced. In the final showdown, 47 slaughtered 48 and the clones, then killed Ort-Meyer himself by snapping his neck.\n\n==Games==\nAs of 2019, seven games had been released, all of them developed by [[IO Interactive]].

(2000)====\n{{main|Hitman: Codename 47}}\nThe first installment in the ''Hitman'' series revolves around a test subject known as 47 escaping the asylum where he had been experimented on all his life and being employed by the Agency. 47 meets his handler, Diana Burnwood, who assigns him to kill four criminal masterminds and then a doctor who is revealed to be the one who treated 47 at the asylum. 47 learns that he is a clone who has been trained since birth to become an assassin. The four criminal masterminds that 47 killed were part of the cloning experiment and their deaths were ordered by Professor Wolfgang Ort-Meyer, the one behind the entire cloning process. Ort-Meyer planned 47's escape, so he could have 47 kill the other four associates and use 47 for his own purposes. 47, with the help of a CIA agent named Carlton Smith, returns to the asylum and plans to kill his creator. Ort-Meyer, having prepared for 47's return, sends his group of clones to kill 47. The clones fail their duties and 47 confronts Ort-Meyer. 47 shoots Ort-Meyer, then snaps his neck, killing him.\n\n====''Hitman 2: Silent Assassin'' (2002)====\n{{main|Hitman 2: Silent Assassin}}\nAfter murdering Dr. Ort-Meyer, Agent 47 has faked his death and unofficially resigned from the ICA, leaving behind his life as an assassin, and retreated to a church in Sicily to seek peace. He works as a gardener for Father Vittorio, his best friend and mentor. 47 attends a confession to admit his sins, but Vittorio understands and believes 47 is decent at heart.\n\nOne day, while 47 is working in a garden, Father Vittorio is kidnapped and a ransom note is left for 47. 47 decides to go back to his old job as an assassin to track down Father Vittorio. He contacts his agency, who thought he was dead, and makes a deal with his handler, Diana Burnwood. He states that he will return to his post as an ICA assassin if the agency can help him locate Father Vittorio. They accept the deal.\n\nDiana informs 47 that Father Vittorio was kidnapped by a Sicilian Mafia boss named Giuseppe Giuliano. The man is holding the priest in a cell under his mansion, dubbed Villa Borghese. 47 infiltrates and kills Giuliano, but fails to find Vittorio. 47 is later told by Diana, that a satellite image shows Father Vittorio being taken away by 'Russian-looking types in uniform'.\n\n47 works with the Agency to repay their attempt to find Vittorio, and eventually saves him. As 47 realizes that he cannot find inner peace, 47 leaves the church and narrates that he can never retire in safety and must return to his life as an assassin.\n\n====''Hitman: Contracts'' (2004)====\n{{main|Hitman: Contracts}}\nThe game begins with a cutscene showing a wounded [[Agent 47]] wandering through a dark hotel corridor and entering his room. He collapses and begins to have flashbacks regarding previous assassinations he committed, beginning with the aftermath of killing [[Dr. Otto Wolfgang Ort-Meyer|Dr. Ort-Meyer]] at the end of the [[Hitman: Codename 47|first Hitman game]]. The missions are primarily focused on replays of previous missions in the original game, except played in reverse. The graphics, maps and artificial intelligence have been customized and improved. In the game, 47 visits several locations, including [[Romania]], [[Kamchatka]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Rotterdam]], [[Budapest]], [[Hong Kong]], and finally [[Paris]].\n\n====''Hitman: Blood Money'' (2006)====\n{{main|Hitman: Blood Money}}\nEach mission is framed around the killing of one or more individuals, which the main protagonist, Agent 47 must accomplish. Standing between him and success are armed guards, security checkpoints, possible witnesses and other obstacles. The player guides 47 through the game's levels with the help of a satellite map which can be accessed at any time. The map indicates the layout of each topographical area of the level, the whereabouts of 47 's main targets, and other AI-controlled characters. In order to carry out his mission, 47 may use any method at his disposal to eliminate his targets, regardless of witnesses or violence done to bystanders. Beyond rewarding stealth over bloodshed as is traditional in the series, ''Blood Money'' includes features that directly penalize the player for making too much noise and/or being too violent; either toward their targets, bystanders, or both.\n\n====''Hitman: Absolution'' (2012)====\n{{main|Hitman: Absolution}}\n''Hitman: Absolution'' was announced by [[Square Enix]] and it was released on 20 November 2012 worldwide for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[OS X]], [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]].<ref name=\"hitman5_news\">{{cite web |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/ps3/action/hitman5/news.html?sid=6179961&mode=all |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130124070324/http://uk.gamespot.com/ps3/action/hitman5/news.html?sid=6179961&mode=all |url-status=dead |archive-date=24 January 2013 |title=SCi reveals new Hitman |publisher=Gamespot UK |date=27 September 2007 |accessdate=16 December 2008 }}</ref><ref name=\"hitman5\">{{cite web |url=http://miranda.hemscott.com/ir/seg/pdf/AnnualReport07.pdf |title=Page 17 of SCi Entertainment Group Plc Annual Report 2007 |publisher=SCi Entertainment Group Plc |accessdate=6 February 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105214640/http://miranda.hemscott.com/ir/seg/pdf/AnnualReport07.pdf |archivedate=5 November 2015 }}</ref><ref name=\"hitman_mag_scan\">{{cite web |url=http://img525.imageshack.us/img525/9283/secretgames4ol6uy9.jpg |title=Magazine scan of Hitman: Absolution reveal |publisher=Xbox World |date=9 December 2007 |accessdate=16 December 2008 |format=JPG |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717092040/http://img525.imageshack.us/img525/9283/secretgames4ol6uy9.jpg |archivedate=17 July 2011}}</ref> The fifth installation in the series offers a few different angles from which to observe surroundings.\n\n====''Hitman'' (2016)====\n{{main|Hitman (2016 video game)}}\nA new ''Hitman'' game was originally to be developed by [[Square Enix]] developer Square Enix Montreal, a newly established studio.<ref>{{cite web |last=Lund |first=Karsten |date=25 October 2012 |url=http://gamasutra.com/blogs/KarstenLund/20121025/179479/The_Future_Hitman_Game_on_a_Postit_Square_Enix_Montral.php |title=The Future Hitman Game, on a Post-it: Square Enix Montr\u00e9al |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |accessdate=11 August 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022155821/http://gamasutra.com/blogs/KarstenLund/20121025/179479/The_Future_Hitman_Game_on_a_Postit_Square_Enix_Montral.php |archivedate=22 October 2013}}</ref> However, due to cutbacks and [[layoff]]s at IO Interactive, a Square Enix representative said that IO Interactive will only focus on the ''Hitman'' franchise in the future.<ref>{{cite web |last=Nath |first=Debabrata |date=17 June 2013 |url=http://www.vg247.com/2013/06/17/hitman-studio-faces-lay-off-nearly-half-of-the-staff-lose-jobs/ |title=Hitman studio face lay-offs, nearly half of the staff lose jobs |publisher=[[VG247]] |accessdate=11 August 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824000242/http://www.vg247.com/2013/06/17/hitman-studio-faces-lay-off-nearly-half-of-the-staff-lose-jobs/ |archivedate=24 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Cowan |first=Danny |date=17 June 2013 |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2013/06/17/report-io-interactive-cancels-projects-loses-half-of-staff-to/ |title=Report: IO Interactive cancels projects, loses half of staff to layoffs |publisher=[[Joystiq]] |accessdate=11 August 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728110516/http://www.joystiq.com/2013/06/17/report-io-interactive-cancels-projects-loses-half-of-staff-to |archivedate=28 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Matulef |first=Jeffrey |date=17 June 2013 |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-06-17-io-interactive-lays-off-nearly-half-its-staff |title=IO Interactive cancels everything that isn't Hitman, including Kane & Lynch |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |accessdate=11 August 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820045305/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-06-17-io-interactive-lays-off-nearly-half-its-staff |archivedate=20 August 2013}}</ref>{{clarify|reason=This paragraph makes no sense.

The film is directed by [[Oz Perkins]], and produced by [[Fred Berger (producer)|Fred Berger]], Brian Kavanaugh-Jones, and Dan Kagan, with a screenplay by Rob Hayes. [[Sophia Lillis]] and Sam Leakey portray the title characters, alongside [[Charles Babalola]], [[Jessica De Gouw]], and [[Alice Krige]]. The story follows Gretel and Hansel as they enter a dark wood in order to find work and food, and then stumble upon the home of a witch.\n\nIt was announced in October 2018 that [[Orion Pictures]] in ''Gretel & Hansel'', a film adaptation based on the German folklore Hansel and Gretel by the Brothers Grimm, with Perkins directing the film from a screenplay he co-wrote with Hayes. At the same time, Lillis was set to star in the film, with other actors being added shortly after, and filming taking place between November and December 2018 in Dublin, Ireland.\n\n''Gretel & Hansel'' was released in North America on January 31, 2020 by Orion Pictures through [[United Artists Releasing]]. The film had grossed $22 million worldwide and received mixed to positive reviews from critics, with praise for its visuals and cinematography, as well as the horror elements and acting, but criticism for the film's pacing.\n\n==Plot==\nA baby that everyone in the village found to be the most precious falls terribly ill one winter. Her father took her to see an enchantress, who removed the illness but left a power within the girl. As she grew older, people in the village went to the girl because she had premonitions of the future. Because she knew everything ended in death, she used her power to kill people, including her father. The child was taken into the woods to be left alone, but she lured other children to a grim fate.\n\nAfter their father's death, teenage Gretel ([[Sophia Lillis]]) and her younger brother Hansel (Sam Leakey) are going to meet a man about a job as a housekeeper. Gretel meets with the man, but he makes his true intentions clear when he asks Gretel if she is still a virgin. The two leave without a job. At night, the siblings' mother rebukes Gretel for not doing what she had to do to get a job and help provide for them. She tells Gretel that she and Hansel must leave because there is no room left in the house. The mother goes as far as threatening to hack Gretel to bits if they don't leave immediately. The siblings flee their home and find a hut to sleep in for the night.\n\nSuddenly, a ghoulish man arises and lets out a horrible scream and makes the kids run away. He chases them outside and attacks Hansel. Before he can get to Gretel, he is killed with an arrow to the head. A hunter ([[Charles Babalola]]) rescues the siblings and takes them into his home for the night and directs them toward others who can provide them with food and work. The following morning, the siblings go outside to forage and seek work. They get frustrated when they find nothing until Gretel spots some mushrooms. They turn out to be \"magic\" mushrooms that cause the two to laugh hysterically. Hansel then wanders until he finds a house that has a cake smell coming from it. Gretel follows as she hears what sounds like a girl's voice beckoning her, seen alongside The Beautiful Child being taken away in a carriage. Gretel tries to stop Hansel from going inside, but he goes anyway and appears to be taken by someone. Gretel tries to start a fire to break inside, but she is greeted by Holda ([[Alice Krige]]), the woman living inside. She invites the siblings inside for a meal and allows them to sleep there in exchange for work.\n \nHolda has Hansel go out into the woods to practice his skills with an axe, while she keeps Gretel at the house. Hansel enjoys his time there because they have plenty of food, but Gretel becomes suspicious of Holda's intentions. Gretel starts to see a vision of the Enchantress and hears children's voices guiding her somewhere, but before she finds out what's going on, she wakes up in her bed. While Hansel goes out, Holda shows Gretel how to tap into her powers as a witch. Gretel goes into the woods and manages to use her power to bring a tree branch near her so she can take a fruit. Meanwhile, Hansel also sees a vision of the Enchantress and spots a satanic carving on a nearby tree. Hansel starts to grow suspicious of Holda. Later in the night, Gretel makes her way into Holda's cellar where Hansel is sitting in a trance. Suddenly, the floor fills with goo, and a younger witch emerges, emptying buckets of guts onto the table before turning them into food, the same that Holda fed the siblings. The next day, Gretel sits with Holda, who eats something and pulls a long strand of a child's hair out of her mouth. Gretel pleads with Holda to let Hansel go, but she refuses.\n\nThrough a series of visions, she tells Gretel the truth about the story of the Beautiful Child: Holda was the girl's mother, and she resented her daughter after she killed her father, and she left the girl in the woods of her own accord. However, the child lingered in Holda's mind, promising to share her powers with her if she trusted the darkness. With that, Holda devoured her other children and took on the disguise of an old woman to appear friendly and lure other children to their fates. Holda straps Gretel to a table in the cellar as she assumes her youthful appearance to lure Hansel into a cage so she can cook him. Gretel manages to use her powers to send a staff toward Holda, impaling her to the wall over the flames. Her body catches fire, and she cries in agony until she is dead, breaking the trance on Hansel and letting Gretel go free. Gretel decides to stay behind at the house while sending Hansel on his way with a horse. The horse brings him back to his old house, where his mother no longer stays. Gretel then sees the spirits of the dead children emerge from the trees, now free at last. However, her fingers turn black just like Holda's did, but her voiceover states that she will be brave and trust in herself.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sophia Lillis]] as Gretel, a 16-year old girl and Hansel's older sister.<ref>{{cite web|first=Borys|last=Kit|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/it-star-sophia-lillis-star-gretel-hansel-film-1149437|title='It' Breakout Sophia Lillis to Star in Fairy Tale Thriller 'Gretel and Hansel' (Exclusive)|date=4 October 2018|website=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=4 July 2019}}</ref>\n* Sam Leakey as Hansel, Gretel's 8-year old brother.

The film is directed by [[Oz Perkins]], and produced by [[Fred Berger (producer)|Fred Berger]], Brian Kavanaugh-Jones, and Dan Kagan, with a screenplay by Rob Hayes. [[Sophia Lillis]] and Sam Leakey portray the title characters, alongside [[Charles Babalola]], [[Jessica De Gouw]], and [[Alice Krige]]. The story follows Gretel and Hansel as they enter a dark wood in order to find work and food, and then stumble upon the home of a witch.\n\nIt was announced in October 2018 that [[Orion Pictures]] in ''Gretel & Hansel'', a film adaptation based on the German folklore Hansel and Gretel by the Brothers Grimm, with Perkins directing the film from a screenplay he co-wrote with Hayes. At the same time, Lillis was set to star in the film, with other actors being added shortly after, and filming taking place between November and December 2018 in Dublin, Ireland.\n\n''Gretel & Hansel'' was released in North America on January 31, 2020 by Orion Pictures through [[United Artists Releasing]]. The film had grossed $22 million worldwide and received mixed to positive reviews from critics, with praise for its visuals and cinematography, as well as the horror elements and acting, but criticism for the film's pacing.\n\n==Plot==\nA baby that everyone in the village found to be the most precious falls terribly ill one winter. Her father took her to see an enchantress, who removed the illness but left a power within the girl. As she grew older, people in the village went to the girl because she had premonitions of the future. Because she knew everything ended in death, she used her power to kill people, including her father. The child was taken into the woods to be left alone, but she lured other children to a grim fate.\n\nAfter their father's death, teenage Gretel ([[Sophia Lillis]]) and her younger brother Hansel (Sam Leakey) are going to meet a man about a job as a housekeeper. Gretel meets with the man, but he makes his true intentions clear when he asks Gretel if she is still a virgin. The two leave without a job. At night, the siblings' mother rebukes Gretel for not doing what she had to do to get a job and help provide for them. She tells Gretel that she and Hansel must leave because there is no room left in the house. The mother goes as far as threatening to hack Gretel to bits if they don't leave immediately. The siblings flee their home and find a hut to sleep in for the night.\n\nSuddenly, a ghoulish man arises and lets out a horrible scream and makes the kids run away. He chases them outside and attacks Hansel. Before he can get to Gretel, he is killed with an arrow to the head. A hunter ([[Charles Babalola]]) rescues the siblings and takes them into his home for the night and directs them toward others who can provide them with food and work. The following morning, the siblings go outside to forage and seek work. They get frustrated when they find nothing until Gretel spots some mushrooms. They turn out to be \"magic\" mushrooms that cause the two to laugh hysterically. Hansel then wanders until he finds a house that has a cake smell coming from it. Gretel follows as she hears what sounds like a girl's voice beckoning her, seen alongside The Beautiful Child being taken away in a carriage. Gretel tries to stop Hansel from going inside, but he goes anyway and appears to be taken by someone. Gretel tries to start a fire to break inside, but she is greeted by Holda ([[Alice Krige]]), the woman living inside. She invites the siblings inside for a meal and allows them to sleep there in exchange for work.\n \nHolda has Hansel go out into the woods to practice his skills with an axe, while she keeps Gretel at the house. Hansel enjoys his time there because they have plenty of food, but Gretel becomes suspicious of Holda's intentions. Gretel starts to see a vision of the Enchantress and hears children's voices guiding her somewhere, but before she finds out what's going on, she wakes up in her bed. While Hansel goes out, Holda shows Gretel how to tap into her powers as a witch. Gretel goes into the woods and manages to use her power to bring a tree branch near her so she can take a fruit. Meanwhile, Hansel also sees a vision of the Enchantress and spots a satanic carving on a nearby tree. Hansel starts to grow suspicious of Holda. Later in the night, Gretel makes her way into Holda's cellar where Hansel is sitting in a trance. Suddenly, the floor fills with goo, and a younger witch emerges, emptying buckets of guts onto the table before turning them into food, the same that Holda fed the siblings. The next day, Gretel sits with Holda, who eats something and pulls a long strand of a child's hair out of her mouth. Gretel pleads with Holda to let Hansel go, but she refuses.\n\nThrough a series of visions, she tells Gretel the truth about the story of the Beautiful Child: Holda was the girl's mother, and she resented her daughter after she killed her father, and she left the girl in the woods of her own accord. However, the child lingered in Holda's mind, promising to share her powers with her if she trusted the darkness. With that, Holda devoured her other children and took on the disguise of an old woman to appear friendly and lure other children to their fates. Holda straps Gretel to a table in the cellar as she assumes her youthful appearance to lure Hansel into a cage so she can cook him. Gretel manages to use her powers to send a staff toward Holda, impaling her to the wall over the flames. Her body catches fire, and she cries in agony until she is dead, breaking the trance on Hansel and letting Gretel go free. Gretel decides to stay behind at the house while sending Hansel on his way with a horse. The horse brings him back to his old house, where his mother no longer stays. Gretel then sees the spirits of the dead children emerge from the trees, now free at last. However, her fingers turn black just like Holda's did, but her voiceover states that she will be brave and trust in herself.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sophia Lillis]] as Gretel, a 16-year old girl and Hansel's older sister.<ref>{{cite web|first=Borys|last=Kit|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/it-star-sophia-lillis-star-gretel-hansel-film-1149437|title='It' Breakout Sophia Lillis to Star in Fairy Tale Thriller 'Gretel and Hansel' (Exclusive)|date=4 October 2018|website=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=4 July 2019}}</ref>\n* Sam Leakey as Hansel, Gretel's 8-year old brother.

The [[Islands of Equatorial Guinea|insular region]] consists of the islands of [[Bioko]] (formerly ''Fernando P\u00f3'') in the Gulf of Guinea and [[Annob\u00f3n Province|Annob\u00f3n]], a small volcanic island which is the only part of the country south of the [[equator]].

He called it ''Formosa'' (\"Beautiful\"), but it quickly took on the name of its European discoverer. [[Fernando P\u00f3 (island)|Fernando P\u00f3]] and Annob\u00f3n were colonized by [[Portugal]] in 1474. The first factories were established on the islands around 1500 as the Portuguese quickly recognized the positives of the islands including volcanic soil and disease-resistant highlands. Despite natural advantages, initial Portuguese efforts in 1507 to establish a sugarcane plantation and town near what is now Concepci\u00f3n on Fernando P\u00f3 failed due to Bubi hostility and fever.<ref>Fegley, Randall (1989). ''Equatorial Guinea: An African Tragedy'', p. 5. Peter Lang, New York. {{ISBN|0820409774}}</ref> The main island's rainy climate, extreme humidity and temperature swings took a major toll on European settlers from the beginning, and it would be centuries before attempts restarted.\n\n===Early Spanish rule and lease to Britain (1778\u20131844)===\nIn 1778, Queen [[Maria I of Portugal]] and King [[Charles III of Spain]] signed the [[Treaty of El Pardo (1778)|Treaty of El Pardo]] which ceded [[Bioko]], adjacent islets, and commercial rights to the [[Bight of Bonny|Bight of Biafra]] between the [[Niger River|Niger]] and [[Ogoue River|Ogoue]] rivers to [[Spanish Empire|Spain]]. Brigadier Felipe Jos\u00e9, Count of Arjelejos sailed from [[Uruguay]] to formally take possession of Bioko from Portugal, landing on the island on October 21, 1778. After sailing for Annob\u00f3n to take possession, the Count died of disease caught on Bioko and the fever-ridden crew mutinied. The crew landed on S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 instead where they were imprisoned by the Portuguese authorities after having lost over 80% of their men to sickness.<ref>Fegley, Randall (1989). ''Equatorial Guinea: An African Tragedy'', p. 6. Peter Lang, New York. {{ISBN|0820409774}}</ref> As a result of this disaster, Spain was thereafter hesitant to invest heavily in their new possession. However, despite the setback Spaniards began to use the island as a base for slave-hunting on the nearby mainland with the support of British merchants. Between 1778 and 1810, the territory of what became Equatorial Guinea was administered by the [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]], based in [[Buenos Aires]].\n\nUnwilling to invest heavily in the development of Fernando P\u00f3, from 1827 to 1843, the Spanish leased a base at Malabo on [[Bioko]] to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] which they had sought as part of their efforts to control the Atlantic [[slavery|slave trade]].<ref>\"Fernando Po\", Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 1911.</ref> Without Spanish permission, the British moved the headquarters of the Mixed Commission for the Suppression of Slave Traffic to Fernando P\u00f3 in 1827, before moving it back to [[Sierra Leone]] under an agreement with Spain in 1843. Spain's decision to abolish slavery in 1817 at British insistence damaged the colony's perceived value to the authorities and so leasing naval bases was an effective revenue earner from an otherwise unprofitable possession.<ref>Fegley, Randall (1989).

An agreement by Spain to sell their African colony to the British was frustrated in 1841 by metropolitan public opinion and angry parliamentarians in Madrid.\n\n===Late 19th century (1844\u20131900)===\nIn 1844, the British restored the island to Spanish sovereignty and the area became known as the \"Territorios Espa\u00f1oles del Golfo de Guinea.\" Due to brutal epidemics Spain still refused to invest much in the colony, and in 1862 a brutal outbreak of yellow fever killed many of the whites that had settled on the island. Despite this, plantations continued to be established by private citizens through third quarter of the 19th century.<ref name=autogenerated3>Fegley, Randall (1989).

The British settled some 2,000 Sierra Leoneans and freed slaves there during their rule, and limited immigration from West Africa and the West Indies continued after the British left. A number of freed Angolan slaves, Portuguese-African creoles and immigrants from Nigeria and Liberia also began to be settled in the colony where they quickly began to join the new group.<ref name=autogenerated1>Fegley, Randall (1989). ''Equatorial Guinea: An African Tragedy'', p. 9. Peter Lang, New York. {{ISBN|0820409774}}</ref> To the local mix were added Cubans, Filipinos, Catalans, Jews and Spaniards of various colours, many of who had deported to Africa for political or other crimes, as well as some settlers backed by the government. \n\nBy 1870 the prognosis of whites that lived on the island was much improved after recommendations that they live in the highlands, and by 1884 much of the minimal administrative machinery and key plantations had moved to [[Pico Basil\u00e9|Basile]] hundreds of metres above sea level. [[Henry Morton Stanley]] had labelled Fernando P\u00f3 \"a jewel which Spain did not polish\" for refusing to enact such a policy. Despite the improved survival chances of Europeans living on the island, [[Mary Kingsley]], who was staying on the island still described Fernando P\u00f3 as 'a more uncomfortable form of execution' for Spaniards appointed there.<ref name=autogenerated3 />\n\nThere was also a trickle of immigration from the neighbouring Portuguese islands, escaped slaves and prospective planters. Although a few of the [[Fernandino peoples|Fernandinos]] were Catholic and Spanish-speaking, about nine-tenths of them were Protestant and English-speaking on the eve of the First World War, and [[pidgin English]] was the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the island. The Sierra Leoneans were particularly well placed as planters while labor recruitment on the [[Ivory Coast|Windward coast]] continued, for they kept family and other connections there and could easily arrange a supply of labor. The Fernandinos proved to become effective traders and middlemen between the natives and Europeans.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> A freed slave from the West Indies by way of Sierra Leone named William Pratt established the cocoa crop on Fernando P\u00f3, forever altering the destiny of the colony.\n\n===Early 20th century (1900\u20131945)===\nSpain had neglected to occupy the large area in the [[Bight of Biafra]] to which it had right by [[treaty]], and the French had busily expanded their occupation at the expense of the area claimed by Spain. Madrid had failed to back the explorations of men like [[Manuel Iradier]] who had signed treaties in the interior as far as Gabon and Cameroon, leaving much of the land out of 'effective occupation' as demanded by the terms of the 1885 [[Berlin Conference]], and events in Cuba and the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] distracted Madrid at an inopportune moment. Minimal government backing for mainland annexation came solely as a result of public opinion and a need for labour on Fernando P\u00f3.<ref>Fegley, Randall (1989).

Land regulations issued in 1904\u20131905 favoured Spaniards, and most of the later big planters arrived from Spain after that. An agreement made with Liberia made in 1914 to import cheap labor greatly favoured wealthy men with ready access to the state, and the shift in labor supplies from Liberia to R\u00edo Muni increased this advantage. Due to malpractice however, the Liberian government eventually ended the treaty after embarrassing revelations about the state of Liberian workers on Fernando P\u00f3 in the Christy Report which brought down the country's president [[Charles D. B. King]] in 1930. In 1940, an estimated 20% of the colony's cocoa production came from African-owned land, nearly all of it was in the hands of Fernandinos.\n\n[[File:Corisco-Saliendo de misa-1910.jpg|thumb|[[Corisco]], 1910]]\nThe greatest constraint to [[economic development]] was a chronic shortage of labour. Pushed into the interior of the island and decimated by alcohol addiction, venereal disease, [[smallpox]], and [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], the indigenous [[Bubi people|Bubi]] population of [[Bioko]] refused to work on [[plantation]]s. Working their own small [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] farms gave them a considerable degree of autonomy.\n\nBy the late nineteenth century, the Bubi were protected from the demands of the planters by Spanish [[Claretians|Claretian]] missionaries, who were very influential in the colony and eventually organised the Bubi into little mission theocracies reminiscent of the famous [[Jesuit]] [[Reducciones|reductions]] in [[Paraguay]]. Catholic penetration was furthered by two small insurrections in 1898 and 1910 protesting [[conscription]] of [[Forced labor|forced labour]] for the plantations. The Bubi were disarmed in 1917, and left dependent on the missionaries.<ref name=\"Clarence-Smith\" /> Serious labour shortages were temporarily solved by a massive influx of refugees from German [[Kamerun]], along with thousands of white German soldiers who stayed on the island for several years.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\nBetween 1926 and 1959 Bioko and Rio Muni were united as the colony of [[Spanish Guinea]]. The economy was based on large [[cocoa bean|cacao]] and [[coffee]] plantations and [[logging]] concessions and the workforce was mostly immigrant [[contract labour]] from [[Liberia]], [[Nigeria]], and [[Cameroun]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Martino, Enrique|title=Clandestine Recruitment Networks in the Bight of Biafra: Fernando P\u00f3's Answer to the Labour Question, 1926\u20131945|journal=International Review of Social History|volume=57|pages=39\u201372|url=http://www.opensourceguinea.org/2013/03/enrique-martino-clandestine-recruitment.html|doi=10.1017/s0020859012000417|year=2012}}</ref> Between 1914 and 1930, an estimated 10,000 Liberians went to Fernando Po under a labour treaty that was stopped altogether in 1930.\n\nWith Liberian workers no longer available, planters of Fernando Po turned to Rio Muni. Campaigns were mounted to subdue the [[Fang people]] in the 1920s, at the time that Liberia was beginning to cut back on recruitment. There were garrisons of the colonial guard throughout the enclave by 1926, and the whole colony was considered 'pacified' by 1929.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/14636204.2013.790703|title=La \u00faltima selva de Espa\u00f1a: Antrop\u00f3fagos, misioneros y guardias civiles.

When the War broke out [[Francisco Franco]] ordered Nationalist forces based in the Canaries to ensure control over Equatorial Guinea. In September 1936 Nationalist forces backed by Falangists from Fernando P\u00f3, in a mirror of what happened in Spain proper 'cleansed' R\u00edo Muni, which under Governor-General Luiz Sanchez Guerra Saez and his deputy Porcel had backed the Republican government. By November the Popular Front and its supporters had been defeated, its leaders executed and Equatorial Guinea secured for Franco. The commander in charge of the occupation, Juan Font\u00e1n Lob\u00e9 was appointed Governor-General by Franco and began to exert more effective Spanish control over the enclave interior.<ref>Fegley, Randall (1989).

Peter Lang, New York. {{ISBN|0820409774}}</ref>\n\nRio Muni had a small population, officially a little over 100,000 in the 1930s, and escape across the frontiers into [[Cameroun]] or [[Gabon]] was very easy. Also, the [[timber]] companies needed increasing numbers of workers, and the spread of [[coffee]] cultivation offered an alternative means of paying taxes{{clarify|date=November 2016}}. Fernando P\u00f3 thus continued to suffer from labour shortages. The French only briefly permitted recruitment in Cameroun, and the main source of labour came to be [[Igbo people|Igbo]] smuggled in canoes from [[Calabar]] in [[Nigeria]]. This resolution to the worker shortage allowed Fernando P\u00f3 to become one of Africa's most productive agricultural areas after the [[Second World War]].<ref name=\"Clarence-Smith\" />\n\n===Final years of Spanish rule (1945\u20131968)===\nPolitically, post-war colonial history has three fairly distinct phases: up to 1959, when its status was raised from 'colonial' to 'provincial', following the approach of the [[Portuguese Empire]]; between 1960 and 1968, when Madrid attempted a partial [[decolonisation]] aimed at keeping the territory as part of the Spanish system; and from 1968 on, after the territory became an independent [[republic]]. The first phase consisted of little more than a continuation of previous policies; these closely resembled the policies of Portugal and France, notably in dividing the population into a vast majority governed as 'natives' or non-citizens, and a very small minority (together with whites) admitted to civic status as ''[[emancipados]]'', [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] to the metropolitan culture being the only permissible means of advancement.<ref>Crowder, Michael, ed. (1984)  ''The Cambridge History of Africa: Volume 8, from C. 1940 to C. 1975''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521224098}}.</ref>\n\nThis 'provincial' phase saw the beginnings of [[nationalism]], but chiefly among small groups who had taken refuge from the ''[[Caudillo]]''{{'}}s paternal hand in Cameroun and Gabon. They formed two bodies: the [[Atanasio Ndongo Miyone|Movimiento Nacional de Liberaci\u00f3n de la Guinea]] (MONALIGE), and the [[Idea Popular de Guinea Ecuatorial]] (IPGE). The pressure they could bring to bear was weak, but the general trend in West Africa was not, and by the late 1960s much of the African continent had been granted independence. Aware of this trend, the Spanish began to increase efforts to prepare the country for independence and massively stepped up development. The Gross National Product per capita in 1965 was $466 which was the highest in black Africa, and the Spanish constructed an international airport at Santa Isabel, a television station and increased the literacy rate to a relatively high 89%. At the same time measures were taken to battle sleeping sickness and leprosy in the enclave, and by 1967 the number of hospital beds per capita in Equatorial Guinea was higher than Spain itself, with 1637 beds in 16 hospitals. All the same, measures to improve education floundered and like in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] by the end of colonial rule the number of Africans in higher education was in only the double digits, and political education necessary to a functioning state was negligible.<ref>Fegley, Randall (1989). ''Equatorial Guinea: An African Tragedy'', p. 59-60. Peter Lang, New York. {{ISBN|0820409774}}</ref>\n\nA decision of 9 August 1963, approved by a referendum of 15 December 1963, gave the territory a measure of autonomy and the administrative promotion of a 'moderate' group, the {{ILL|Movimiento de Uni\u00f3n Nacional de la Guinea Ecuatorial|es}} (MUNGE). This proved a feeble instrument, and, with growing pressure for change from the UN, Madrid was gradually forced to give way to the currents of nationalism. Two General Assembly resolutions were passed in 1965 ordering Spain to grant independence to the colony, and in 1966 a UN Commission toured the country before recommending the same thing. In response, the Spanish declared that they would hold a constitutional convention on 27 October 1967 to negotiate a new constitution for an independent Equatorial Guinea. The conference was attended by 41 local delegates and 25 Spaniards. The Africans were principally divided between Fernandinos and Bubi on one side, who feared a loss of privileges and 'swamping' by the Fang majority, and the R\u00edo Muni Fang nationalists on the other. At the conference the leading Fang figure, the later first president [[Francisco Mac\u00edas Nguema]] gave a controversial speech in which he claimed that [[Adolf Hitler]] had 'saved Africa'<ref>Fegley, Randall (1989). ''Equatorial Guinea: An African Tragedy'', p. 51-52. Peter Lang, New York. {{ISBN|0820409774}}</ref> After nine sessions the conference was suspended due to deadlock between the 'unionists' and 'separatists' who wanted a separate Fernando P\u00f3. Mac\u00edas resolved to travel to the UN to bolster international awareness of the issue, and his firebrand speeches in New York contributed to Spain naming a date for both independence and general elections. In July 1968 virtually all Bubi leaders journed to the UN in New York to try and raise awareness for their cause, but the world community was uninterested in quibbling over the specifics of colonial independence. The 1960s were a time of great optimism over the future of the former African colonies, and groups that had been close to European rulers like the Bubi were not viewed positively.<ref>Fegley, Randall (1989).

Much of his campaigning involved visiting rural areas of R\u00edo Muni and promising young Fang that they would have the houses and wives of the Spanish if they voted for him. In the towns he had instead presented himself as the urbane leader who had bested the Spanish at the UN, and he had won in the second round of voting - greatly helped by the vote-splitting of his rivals. \n\nThe euphoria of independence became quickly overshadowed by problems emanating from the [[Nigerian Civil War]]. Fernando P\u00f3 was inhabited by many Biafra-supporting Ibo migrant workers and many refugees from the breakaway state fled to the island, straining it to breaking point. The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] began running relief flights out of Equatorial Guinea, but Mac\u00edas quickly became spooked and shut the flights down, refusing to allow them to fly diesel fuel for their trucks nor oxygen tanks for medical operations. Very quickly the Biafran separatists were starved into submission without international backing.<ref>Fegley, Randall (1989). ''Equatorial Guinea: An African Tragedy'', p. 60.

Prime Minister [[Francisco Pascual Obama Asue]] was appointed by Obiang and operates under powers delegated by the President. \n\nDuring the four decades of his rule, Obiang has shown little tolerance for opposition. While the country is nominally a multiparty democracy, its elections have generally been considered a sham. According to [[Human Rights Watch]], the dictatorship of President Obiang used an [[oil boom]] to entrench and enrich itself further at the expense of the country's people.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13317174 BBC News \u2013 Equatorial Guinea country profile \u2013 Overview].

The vote on the constitution was taken though neither the text or its content was revealed to the public before the vote. Under the new constitution the president was limited to a maximum of two seven-year terms and would be both the head of state and head of the government, therefore eliminating the prime minister. The new constitution also introduced the figure of a vice president and called for the creation of a 70-member senate with 55 senators elected by the people and the 15 remaining designated by the president. Surprisingly, in the following cabinet reshuffle it was announced that there would be two vice-presidents in clear violation of the constitution that was just taking effect.<ref>[http://www.guineaecuatorialpress.com/noticia.php?id=2668&lang=en Ignacio Milam Tang, new Vice President of the Nation]. guineaecuatorialpress.com. 22 May 2012.</ref>\n\nIn October 2012, during an interview with [[Christiane Amanpour]] on [[CNN]], Obiang was asked whether he would step down at the end of the current term (2009\u20132016) since the new constitution limited the number of terms to two and he has been reelected at least 4 times. Obiang answered he refused to step aside because the new constitution was not retroactive and the two- term limit would only become applicable from 2016.<ref>[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1210/05/ampr.01.html Interview with President Teodoro Obiang of Equatorial Guinea]. CNN. 5 October 2012.</ref>\n\n26 May 2013 elections combined the senate, lower house and mayoral contests all in a single package. Like all previous elections, this was denounced by the opposition and it too was won by Obiang's PDGE. During the electoral contest, the ruling party hosted internal elections which were later scrapped as none of the president's favorite candidates led the internal lists. Ultimately, the ruling party and the satellites of the ruling coalition decided to run not based on the candidates but based on the party. This created a situation where during the election the ruling party's coalition did not provide the names of their candidates so effectively individuals were not running for office, instead the party was the one running for office.\n\nThe May 2013 elections were marked by a series of events including the popular protest planned by a group of activists from the MPP (Movement of Popular Protest) which included several social and political groups. The MPP called for a peaceful protest at the Plaza de la Mujer square on 15 May. MPP coordinator Enrique Nsolo Nzo was arrested and official state media portrayed him as planning to destabilize the country and depose the president. However, and despite speaking under duress and with clear signs of torture, Nsolo said that they had planned a peaceful protest and had indeed obtained all the legal authorizations required to carry out the peaceful protest. In addition to that, he firmly stated that he was not affiliated with any political party. The Plaza de la Mujer square in Malabo was occupied by the police from 13 May and it has been heavily guarded ever since. The government embarked on a [[censorship]] program that affected social sites including Facebook and other websites that were critical to the government of Equatorial Guinea. The censorship was implemented by redirecting online searches to the official government website.\n\nShortly after the elections, opposition party CPDS announced that they were going to protest peacefully against the 26 May elections on 25 June.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cpds-gq.org/attachments/article/269/Comunicado_convocatoria_manifestacion.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221031810/http://www.cpds-gq.org/attachments/article/269/Comunicado_convocatoria_manifestacion.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2014-02-21|title=Convocatorial de Manifestacion, 25 de Junio 2013|work=cpds-gq.org}}</ref> Interior minister Clemente Engonga refused to authorize the protest on the grounds that it could \"destabilize\" the country and CPDS decided to go forward, claiming constitutional right. On the night of 24 June, the CPDS headquarters in Malabo were surrounded by heavily armed police officers to keep those inside from leaving and thus effectively blocking the protest. Several leading members of CPDS were detained in Malabo and others in Bata were kept from boarding several local flights to Malabo.\n\n==Geography==\n{{Main|Geography of Equatorial Guinea}}\nEquatorial Guinea is on the west coast of [[Central Africa]]. The country consists of a mainland territory, [[R\u00edo Muni]], which is bordered by Cameroon to the north and Gabon to the east and south, and five small islands, [[Bioko]], [[Corisco]], [[Annob\u00f3n]], [[Elobey Chico]] (Small Elobey), and [[Elobey Grande]] (Great Elobey). Bioko, the site of the capital, [[Malabo]], lies about {{convert|40|km|sp=us}} off the coast of Cameroon. Annob\u00f3n Island is about {{convert|350|km|sp=us}} west-south-west of [[Cape Lopez]] in Gabon. Corisco and the two Elobey islands are in Corisco Bay, on the border of R\u00edo Muni and Gabon.\n\nEquatorial Guinea lies between latitudes [[4th parallel north|4\u00b0N]] and [[2nd parallel south|2\u00b0S]], and longitudes [[5th meridian west|5\u00b0]] and [[12th meridian east|12\u00b0E]].

According to the ''Encyclopedia of the Stateless Nations'' (2002) 7% of Bioko islanders were [[Igbo people|Igbo]], an ethnic group from southeastern Nigeria.<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the Stateless Nations: A-C|first=James|last=Minahan|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2002|isbn=0-313-32109-4|page=330}}</ref> Equatorial Guinea received [[Asians]] and native Africans from other countries as workers on cocoa and coffee plantations. Other black Africans came from [[Liberia]], Angola, and [[Mozambique]]. Most of the Asian population is [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]], with small numbers of [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indians]].\n\nEquatorial Guinea has also been a destination for fortune-seeking European settlers from Britain, France and Germany. Israelis and [[Moroccan people|Moroccans]] also live and work here. [[Petroleum|Oil extraction]] since the 1990s has contributed to a doubling of the population in Malabo. After independence, thousands of Equatorial Guineans went to Spain. Another 100,000 Equatorial Guineans went to Cameroon, Gabon, and Nigeria because of the dictatorship of [[Francisco Mac\u00edas Nguema]]. Some Equatorial Guinean communities are also found in Latin America, the United States, Portugal, and France.\n\n===Languages===\nFor years, the official languages were [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (the local variant is [[Equatoguinean Spanish]]) and [[French language|French]].<ref name=CIA /> Portuguese was also adopted as an official language in 2010.<ref name=\"CPLP\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cplp.org/id-258.aspx|title=Guin\u00e9 Equatorial|publisher=CPLP|accessdate=28 November 2014|language=Portuguese}}</ref><ref name=\"sol\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sol.pt/noticia/99354|title=Forma\u00e7\u00e3o de professores e programas televisivos introduzem portugu\u00eas na Guin\u00e9-Equatorial|language=Portuguese |trans-title=Teacher formation and television programs introduce Portuguese in Equatorial Guinea|publisher=Sol|date=5 February 2014}}</ref> Spanish has been an official language since 1844.

The [[Islands of Equatorial Guinea|insular region]] consists of the islands of [[Bioko]] (formerly ''Fernando P\u00f3'') in the Gulf of Guinea and [[Annob\u00f3n Province|Annob\u00f3n]], a small volcanic island which is the only part of the country south of the [[equator]].

The mainland region, [[R\u00edo Muni]], is bordered by [[Cameroon]] on the north and [[Gabon]] on the south and east. It is the location of [[Bata, Equatorial Guinea|Bata]], Equatorial Guinea's largest city, and [[Ciudad de la Paz]], the country's planned future capital.

He called it ''Formosa'' (\"Beautiful\"), but it quickly took on the name of its European discoverer. [[Fernando P\u00f3 (island)|Fernando P\u00f3]] and Annob\u00f3n were colonized by [[Portugal]] in 1474. The first factories were established on the islands around 1500 as the Portuguese quickly recognized the positives of the islands including volcanic soil and disease-resistant highlands. Despite natural advantages, initial Portuguese efforts in 1507 to establish a sugarcane plantation and town near what is now Concepci\u00f3n on Fernando P\u00f3 failed due to Bubi hostility and fever.<ref>Fegley, Randall (1989). ''Equatorial Guinea: An African Tragedy'', p. 5. Peter Lang, New York. {{ISBN|0820409774}}</ref> The main island's rainy climate, extreme humidity and temperature swings took a major toll on European settlers from the beginning, and it would be centuries before attempts restarted.\n\n===Early Spanish rule and lease to Britain (1778\u20131844)===\nIn 1778, Queen [[Maria I of Portugal]] and King [[Charles III of Spain]] signed the [[Treaty of El Pardo (1778)|Treaty of El Pardo]] which ceded [[Bioko]], adjacent islets, and commercial rights to the [[Bight of Bonny|Bight of Biafra]] between the [[Niger River|Niger]] and [[Ogoue River|Ogoue]] rivers to [[Spanish Empire|Spain]]. Brigadier Felipe Jos\u00e9, Count of Arjelejos sailed from [[Uruguay]] to formally take possession of Bioko from Portugal, landing on the island on October 21, 1778. After sailing for Annob\u00f3n to take possession, the Count died of disease caught on Bioko and the fever-ridden crew mutinied. The crew landed on S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 instead where they were imprisoned by the Portuguese authorities after having lost over 80% of their men to sickness.<ref>Fegley, Randall (1989). ''Equatorial Guinea: An African Tragedy'', p. 6. Peter Lang, New York. {{ISBN|0820409774}}</ref> As a result of this disaster, Spain was thereafter hesitant to invest heavily in their new possession. However, despite the setback Spaniards began to use the island as a base for slave-hunting on the nearby mainland with the support of British merchants. Between 1778 and 1810, the territory of what became Equatorial Guinea was administered by the [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]], based in [[Buenos Aires]].\n\nUnwilling to invest heavily in the development of Fernando P\u00f3, from 1827 to 1843, the Spanish leased a base at Malabo on [[Bioko]] to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] which they had sought as part of their efforts to control the Atlantic [[slavery|slave trade]].<ref>\"Fernando Po\", Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 1911.</ref> Without Spanish permission, the British moved the headquarters of the Mixed Commission for the Suppression of Slave Traffic to Fernando P\u00f3 in 1827, before moving it back to [[Sierra Leone]] under an agreement with Spain in 1843. Spain's decision to abolish slavery in 1817 at British insistence damaged the colony's perceived value to the authorities and so leasing naval bases was an effective revenue earner from an otherwise unprofitable possession.<ref>Fegley, Randall (1989). ''Equatorial Guinea: An African Tragedy'', p. 6-7. Peter Lang, New York. {{ISBN|0820409774}}</ref> It was from Fernando P\u00f3 that governor [[John Beecroft]] launched the [[Reduction of Lagos|seizure of Lagos]] that marked the first British incursion into Nigeria. An agreement by Spain to sell their African colony to the British was frustrated in 1841 by metropolitan public opinion and angry parliamentarians in Madrid.\n\n===Late 19th century (1844\u20131900)===\nIn 1844, the British restored the island to Spanish sovereignty and the area became known as the \"Territorios Espa\u00f1oles del Golfo de Guinea.\" Due to brutal epidemics Spain still refused to invest much in the colony, and in 1862 a brutal outbreak of yellow fever killed many of the whites that had settled on the island. Despite this, plantations continued to be established by private citizens through third quarter of the 19th century.<ref name=autogenerated3>Fegley, Randall (1989). ''Equatorial Guinea: An African Tragedy'', p. 13. Peter Lang, New York. {{ISBN|0820409774}}</ref>\n\nThe [[plantation]]s of [[Bioko|Fernando P\u00f3]] were mostly run by a black [[Creole elite]], later known as [[Fernandino peoples|Fernandinos]]. The British settled some 2,000 Sierra Leoneans and freed slaves there during their rule, and limited immigration from West Africa and the West Indies continued after the British left. A number of freed Angolan slaves, Portuguese-African creoles and immigrants from Nigeria and Liberia also began to be settled in the colony where they quickly began to join the new group.<ref name=autogenerated1>Fegley, Randall (1989). ''Equatorial Guinea: An African Tragedy'', p. 9. Peter Lang, New York. {{ISBN|0820409774}}</ref> To the local mix were added Cubans, Filipinos, Catalans, Jews and Spaniards of various colours, many of who had deported to Africa for political or other crimes, as well as some settlers backed by the government. \n\nBy 1870 the prognosis of whites that lived on the island was much improved after recommendations that they live in the highlands, and by 1884 much of the minimal administrative machinery and key plantations had moved to [[Pico Basil\u00e9|Basile]] hundreds of metres above sea level. [[Henry Morton Stanley]] had labelled Fernando P\u00f3 \"a jewel which Spain did not polish\" for refusing to enact such a policy. Despite the improved survival chances of Europeans living on the island, [[Mary Kingsley]], who was staying on the island still described Fernando P\u00f3 as 'a more uncomfortable form of execution' for Spaniards appointed there.<ref name=autogenerated3 />\n\nThere was also a trickle of immigration from the neighbouring Portuguese islands, escaped slaves and prospective planters. Although a few of the [[Fernandino peoples|Fernandinos]] were Catholic and Spanish-speaking, about nine-tenths of them were Protestant and English-speaking on the eve of the First World War, and [[pidgin English]] was the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the island. The Sierra Leoneans were particularly well placed as planters while labor recruitment on the [[Ivory Coast|Windward coast]] continued, for they kept family and other connections there and could easily arrange a supply of labor. The Fernandinos proved to become effective traders and middlemen between the natives and Europeans.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> A freed slave from the West Indies by way of Sierra Leone named William Pratt established the cocoa crop on Fernando P\u00f3, forever altering the destiny of the colony.\n\n===Early 20th century (1900\u20131945)===\nSpain had neglected to occupy the large area in the [[Bight of Biafra]] to which it had right by [[treaty]], and the French had busily expanded their occupation at the expense of the area claimed by Spain. Madrid had failed to back the explorations of men like [[Manuel Iradier]] who had signed treaties in the interior as far as Gabon and Cameroon, leaving much of the land out of 'effective occupation' as demanded by the terms of the 1885 [[Berlin Conference]], and events in Cuba and the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] distracted Madrid at an inopportune moment. Minimal government backing for mainland annexation came solely as a result of public opinion and a need for labour on Fernando P\u00f3.<ref>Fegley, Randall (1989).

Land regulations issued in 1904\u20131905 favoured Spaniards, and most of the later big planters arrived from Spain after that. An agreement made with Liberia made in 1914 to import cheap labor greatly favoured wealthy men with ready access to the state, and the shift in labor supplies from Liberia to R\u00edo Muni increased this advantage. Due to malpractice however, the Liberian government eventually ended the treaty after embarrassing revelations about the state of Liberian workers on Fernando P\u00f3 in the Christy Report which brought down the country's president [[Charles D. B. King]] in 1930. In 1940, an estimated 20% of the colony's cocoa production came from African-owned land, nearly all of it was in the hands of Fernandinos.\n\n[[File:Corisco-Saliendo de misa-1910.jpg|thumb|[[Corisco]], 1910]]\nThe greatest constraint to [[economic development]] was a chronic shortage of labour. Pushed into the interior of the island and decimated by alcohol addiction, venereal disease, [[smallpox]], and [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], the indigenous [[Bubi people|Bubi]] population of [[Bioko]] refused to work on [[plantation]]s. Working their own small [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] farms gave them a considerable degree of autonomy.\n\nBy the late nineteenth century, the Bubi were protected from the demands of the planters by Spanish [[Claretians|Claretian]] missionaries, who were very influential in the colony and eventually organised the Bubi into little mission theocracies reminiscent of the famous [[Jesuit]] [[Reducciones|reductions]] in [[Paraguay]]. Catholic penetration was furthered by two small insurrections in 1898 and 1910 protesting [[conscription]] of [[Forced labor|forced labour]] for the plantations. The Bubi were disarmed in 1917, and left dependent on the missionaries.<ref name=\"Clarence-Smith\" /> Serious labour shortages were temporarily solved by a massive influx of refugees from German [[Kamerun]], along with thousands of white German soldiers who stayed on the island for several years.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\nBetween 1926 and 1959 Bioko and Rio Muni were united as the colony of [[Spanish Guinea]]. The economy was based on large [[cocoa bean|cacao]] and [[coffee]] plantations and [[logging]] concessions and the workforce was mostly immigrant [[contract labour]] from [[Liberia]], [[Nigeria]], and [[Cameroun]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Martino, Enrique|title=Clandestine Recruitment Networks in the Bight of Biafra: Fernando P\u00f3's Answer to the Labour Question, 1926\u20131945|journal=International Review of Social History|volume=57|pages=39\u201372|url=http://www.opensourceguinea.org/2013/03/enrique-martino-clandestine-recruitment.html|doi=10.1017/s0020859012000417|year=2012}}</ref> Between 1914 and 1930, an estimated 10,000 Liberians went to Fernando Po under a labour treaty that was stopped altogether in 1930.\n\nWith Liberian workers no longer available, planters of Fernando Po turned to Rio Muni. Campaigns were mounted to subdue the [[Fang people]] in the 1920s, at the time that Liberia was beginning to cut back on recruitment. There were garrisons of the colonial guard throughout the enclave by 1926, and the whole colony was considered 'pacified' by 1929.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/14636204.2013.790703|title=La \u00faltima selva de Espa\u00f1a: Antrop\u00f3fagos, misioneros y guardias civiles.

When the War broke out [[Francisco Franco]] ordered Nationalist forces based in the Canaries to ensure control over Equatorial Guinea. In September 1936 Nationalist forces backed by Falangists from Fernando P\u00f3, in a mirror of what happened in Spain proper 'cleansed' R\u00edo Muni, which under Governor-General Luiz Sanchez Guerra Saez and his deputy Porcel had backed the Republican government. By November the Popular Front and its supporters had been defeated, its leaders executed and Equatorial Guinea secured for Franco. The commander in charge of the occupation, Juan Font\u00e1n Lob\u00e9 was appointed Governor-General by Franco and began to exert more effective Spanish control over the enclave interior.<ref>Fegley, Randall (1989). ''Equatorial Guinea: An African Tragedy'', p. 20-21. Peter Lang, New York. {{ISBN|0820409774}}</ref>\n\nRio Muni had a small population, officially a little over 100,000 in the 1930s, and escape across the frontiers into [[Cameroun]] or [[Gabon]] was very easy. Also, the [[timber]] companies needed increasing numbers of workers, and the spread of [[coffee]] cultivation offered an alternative means of paying taxes{{clarify|date=November 2016}}. Fernando P\u00f3 thus continued to suffer from labour shortages. The French only briefly permitted recruitment in Cameroun, and the main source of labour came to be [[Igbo people|Igbo]] smuggled in canoes from [[Calabar]] in [[Nigeria]]. This resolution to the worker shortage allowed Fernando P\u00f3 to become one of Africa's most productive agricultural areas after the [[Second World War]].<ref name=\"Clarence-Smith\" />\n\n===Final years of Spanish rule (1945\u20131968)===\nPolitically, post-war colonial history has three fairly distinct phases: up to 1959, when its status was raised from 'colonial' to 'provincial', following the approach of the [[Portuguese Empire]]; between 1960 and 1968, when Madrid attempted a partial [[decolonisation]] aimed at keeping the territory as part of the Spanish system; and from 1968 on, after the territory became an independent [[republic]]. The first phase consisted of little more than a continuation of previous policies; these closely resembled the policies of Portugal and France, notably in dividing the population into a vast majority governed as 'natives' or non-citizens, and a very small minority (together with whites) admitted to civic status as ''[[emancipados]]'', [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] to the metropolitan culture being the only permissible means of advancement.<ref>Crowder, Michael, ed. (1984)  ''The Cambridge History of Africa: Volume 8, from C. 1940 to C. 1975''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521224098}}.</ref>\n\nThis 'provincial' phase saw the beginnings of [[nationalism]], but chiefly among small groups who had taken refuge from the ''[[Caudillo]]''{{'}}s paternal hand in Cameroun and Gabon. They formed two bodies: the [[Atanasio Ndongo Miyone|Movimiento Nacional de Liberaci\u00f3n de la Guinea]] (MONALIGE), and the [[Idea Popular de Guinea Ecuatorial]] (IPGE). The pressure they could bring to bear was weak, but the general trend in West Africa was not, and by the late 1960s much of the African continent had been granted independence. Aware of this trend, the Spanish began to increase efforts to prepare the country for independence and massively stepped up development. The Gross National Product per capita in 1965 was $466 which was the highest in black Africa, and the Spanish constructed an international airport at Santa Isabel, a television station and increased the literacy rate to a relatively high 89%. At the same time measures were taken to battle sleeping sickness and leprosy in the enclave, and by 1967 the number of hospital beds per capita in Equatorial Guinea was higher than Spain itself, with 1637 beds in 16 hospitals. All the same, measures to improve education floundered and like in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] by the end of colonial rule the number of Africans in higher education was in only the double digits, and political education necessary to a functioning state was negligible.<ref>Fegley, Randall (1989). ''Equatorial Guinea: An African Tragedy'', p. 59-60. Peter Lang, New York. {{ISBN|0820409774}}</ref>\n\nA decision of 9 August 1963, approved by a referendum of 15 December 1963, gave the territory a measure of autonomy and the administrative promotion of a 'moderate' group, the {{ILL|Movimiento de Uni\u00f3n Nacional de la Guinea Ecuatorial|es}} (MUNGE). This proved a feeble instrument, and, with growing pressure for change from the UN, Madrid was gradually forced to give way to the currents of nationalism. Two General Assembly resolutions were passed in 1965 ordering Spain to grant independence to the colony, and in 1966 a UN Commission toured the country before recommending the same thing. In response, the Spanish declared that they would hold a constitutional convention on 27 October 1967 to negotiate a new constitution for an independent Equatorial Guinea. The conference was attended by 41 local delegates and 25 Spaniards. The Africans were principally divided between Fernandinos and Bubi on one side, who feared a loss of privileges and 'swamping' by the Fang majority, and the R\u00edo Muni Fang nationalists on the other. At the conference the leading Fang figure, the later first president [[Francisco Mac\u00edas Nguema]] gave a controversial speech in which he claimed that [[Adolf Hitler]] had 'saved Africa'<ref>Fegley, Randall (1989). ''Equatorial Guinea: An African Tragedy'', p. 51-52. Peter Lang, New York. {{ISBN|0820409774}}</ref> After nine sessions the conference was suspended due to deadlock between the 'unionists' and 'separatists' who wanted a separate Fernando P\u00f3. Mac\u00edas resolved to travel to the UN to bolster international awareness of the issue, and his firebrand speeches in New York contributed to Spain naming a date for both independence and general elections. In July 1968 virtually all Bubi leaders journed to the UN in New York to try and raise awareness for their cause, but the world community was uninterested in quibbling over the specifics of colonial independence. The 1960s were a time of great optimism over the future of the former African colonies, and groups that had been close to European rulers like the Bubi were not viewed positively.<ref>Fegley, Randall (1989).

Much of his campaigning involved visiting rural areas of R\u00edo Muni and promising young Fang that they would have the houses and wives of the Spanish if they voted for him. In the towns he had instead presented himself as the urbane leader who had bested the Spanish at the UN, and he had won in the second round of voting - greatly helped by the vote-splitting of his rivals. \n\nThe euphoria of independence became quickly overshadowed by problems emanating from the [[Nigerian Civil War]]. Fernando P\u00f3 was inhabited by many Biafra-supporting Ibo migrant workers and many refugees from the breakaway state fled to the island, straining it to breaking point. The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] began running relief flights out of Equatorial Guinea, but Mac\u00edas quickly became spooked and shut the flights down, refusing to allow them to fly diesel fuel for their trucks nor oxygen tanks for medical operations. Very quickly the Biafran separatists were starved into submission without international backing.<ref>Fegley, Randall (1989). ''Equatorial Guinea: An African Tragedy'', p. 60.

The vote on the constitution was taken though neither the text or its content was revealed to the public before the vote. Under the new constitution the president was limited to a maximum of two seven-year terms and would be both the head of state and head of the government, therefore eliminating the prime minister. The new constitution also introduced the figure of a vice president and called for the creation of a 70-member senate with 55 senators elected by the people and the 15 remaining designated by the president. Surprisingly, in the following cabinet reshuffle it was announced that there would be two vice-presidents in clear violation of the constitution that was just taking effect.<ref>[http://www.guineaecuatorialpress.com/noticia.php?id=2668&lang=en Ignacio Milam Tang, new Vice President of the Nation]. guineaecuatorialpress.com. 22 May 2012.</ref>\n\nIn October 2012, during an interview with [[Christiane Amanpour]] on [[CNN]], Obiang was asked whether he would step down at the end of the current term (2009\u20132016) since the new constitution limited the number of terms to two and he has been reelected at least 4 times. Obiang answered he refused to step aside because the new constitution was not retroactive and the two- term limit would only become applicable from 2016.<ref>[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1210/05/ampr.01.html Interview with President Teodoro Obiang of Equatorial Guinea]. CNN. 5 October 2012.</ref>\n\n26 May 2013 elections combined the senate, lower house and mayoral contests all in a single package. Like all previous elections, this was denounced by the opposition and it too was won by Obiang's PDGE. During the electoral contest, the ruling party hosted internal elections which were later scrapped as none of the president's favorite candidates led the internal lists. Ultimately, the ruling party and the satellites of the ruling coalition decided to run not based on the candidates but based on the party. This created a situation where during the election the ruling party's coalition did not provide the names of their candidates so effectively individuals were not running for office, instead the party was the one running for office.\n\nThe May 2013 elections were marked by a series of events including the popular protest planned by a group of activists from the MPP (Movement of Popular Protest) which included several social and political groups. The MPP called for a peaceful protest at the Plaza de la Mujer square on 15 May. MPP coordinator Enrique Nsolo Nzo was arrested and official state media portrayed him as planning to destabilize the country and depose the president. However, and despite speaking under duress and with clear signs of torture, Nsolo said that they had planned a peaceful protest and had indeed obtained all the legal authorizations required to carry out the peaceful protest. In addition to that, he firmly stated that he was not affiliated with any political party. The Plaza de la Mujer square in Malabo was occupied by the police from 13 May and it has been heavily guarded ever since. The government embarked on a [[censorship]] program that affected social sites including Facebook and other websites that were critical to the government of Equatorial Guinea. The censorship was implemented by redirecting online searches to the official government website.\n\nShortly after the elections, opposition party CPDS announced that they were going to protest peacefully against the 26 May elections on 25 June.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cpds-gq.org/attachments/article/269/Comunicado_convocatoria_manifestacion.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221031810/http://www.cpds-gq.org/attachments/article/269/Comunicado_convocatoria_manifestacion.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2014-02-21|title=Convocatorial de Manifestacion, 25 de Junio 2013|work=cpds-gq.org}}</ref> Interior minister Clemente Engonga refused to authorize the protest on the grounds that it could \"destabilize\" the country and CPDS decided to go forward, claiming constitutional right. On the night of 24 June, the CPDS headquarters in Malabo were surrounded by heavily armed police officers to keep those inside from leaving and thus effectively blocking the protest. Several leading members of CPDS were detained in Malabo and others in Bata were kept from boarding several local flights to Malabo.\n\n==Geography==\n{{Main|Geography of Equatorial Guinea}}\nEquatorial Guinea is on the west coast of [[Central Africa]]. The country consists of a mainland territory, [[R\u00edo Muni]], which is bordered by Cameroon to the north and Gabon to the east and south, and five small islands, [[Bioko]], [[Corisco]], [[Annob\u00f3n]], [[Elobey Chico]] (Small Elobey), and [[Elobey Grande]] (Great Elobey). Bioko, the site of the capital, [[Malabo]], lies about {{convert|40|km|sp=us}} off the coast of Cameroon. Annob\u00f3n Island is about {{convert|350|km|sp=us}} west-south-west of [[Cape Lopez]] in Gabon. Corisco and the two Elobey islands are in Corisco Bay, on the border of R\u00edo Muni and Gabon.\n\nEquatorial Guinea lies between latitudes [[4th parallel north|4\u00b0N]] and [[2nd parallel south|2\u00b0S]], and longitudes [[5th meridian west|5\u00b0]] and [[12th meridian east|12\u00b0E]].

From June to August, R\u00edo Muni is dry and Bioko wet; from December to February, the reverse occurs. In between there is gradual transition. Rain or mist occurs daily on Annob\u00f3n, where a cloudless day has never been registered. The temperature at Malabo, Bioko, ranges from {{convert|16|C}} to {{convert|33|C}}, though on the southern [[Moka Plateau]] normal high temperatures are only {{convert|21|C}}. In R\u00edo Muni, the average temperature is about {{convert|27|C}}. Annual [[rainfall]] varied from {{convert|1930|mm|abbr=on}} at Malabo to {{convert|10920|mm|abbr=on}} at [[San Antonio de Ureca|Ureka]], Bioko, but R\u00edo Muni is somewhat drier.<ref>[http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Africa/Equatorial-Guinea-CLIMATE.html Nations Encyclopedia].
