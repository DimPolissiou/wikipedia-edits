The new campus was begun in 1966 on Wascana Lake, to the southeast of the old campus whose buildings, however, remain in use: the old Girls' Residence is now used by the Regina Conservatory of Music; the Normal School, having at various times housed not only the teacher-training facility that is now the University's Department of Education but the [[Royal Saskatchewan Museum|Saskatchewan Museum of Natural History]], war-training facilities during World War II when it was temporarily resumed by the federal crown and latterly the University's Fine Arts Department, is now the [[Canada-Saskatchewan Soundstage]].\n\nThe original design of Regina Campus (as of [[Wascana Centre]] itself) and its initial buildings, in a stark concrete [[modernist]] style, were by [[Minoru Yamasaki]], the architect of the original [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] in New York.<ref name=\"UofR\"/>\n\n{{clear}}\n;Yamasaki's original vision: \n{{quotation |[was that ...the buildings] would be located close enough together that passage between them in the winter could be provided through connecting corridors in the \"podium\" or first [ground] floor of all buildings in the central instructional complex. Each podium would be larger than the remaining floors of the buildings rising above it, thereby creating the impression of separate buildings rising from a common base. The buildings would be constructed around sunken, landscaped courts which would be accessible visually and physically by generous windows and doors from the corridors located along these enclosing walls...<ref>Fletcher, Tom. \"The Work of Minoru Yamasaki,\" ''New York Architecture Images and Notes''.

(St Chad's, a fourth denominational college in Regina, operated by the [[Anglican Church of Canada]] on the former Anglican diocesan property on College Avenue immediately to the east of Regina College, merged with Emmanuel College on the Saskatoon campus in 1964 and, after a period of continuing to operate its private girls' high school closed its Regina facilities in 1970.<ref>Neither the United nor the Anglican Church now maintains any continuing official involvement with the university despite their pioneering work in tertiary education in Regina. After the Anglicans closed their tertiary facility St Chad's girls' school continued to be run by the Sisters of St John the Divine, a Canadian Anglican religious order.

That being said, several of the university's faculties are significantly smaller in the 21st century than they were in the 1970s as priorities have shifted from liberal arts to vocational training.{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source and examples. |date=February 2017}}\n\nThe original Regina College buildings on College Avenue continue in use; the old Girls' Residence is now the Regina Conservatory of Music; in 1997 the Fine Arts Department moved from the old Normal School building to the new W.A.

Since the late 1990s, several new buildings have been added including the Dr. William A. Riddell Centre; the Wakp\u00e1 Tower (South) and Paskw\u0101w Tower (North) Residences; the Centre for Kinesiology, Health & Sport; [[First Nations University of Canada]] and Research & Innovation Centre; along with a significant expansion of the Education Building.\n\nThe building of the Wakp\u00e1 Tower (South) and Paskw\u0101w Tower (North) Residences also involved a significant redevelopment of the landscaping of the campus around a new oval<ref>[https://www.uregina.ca/campusgrowth/projects/completed/academicgreen.shtml \"The Dr Lloyd Barber Academic Green.\"] Retrieved 17 July 2006.</ref> as an aesthetic and community hub of campus. Future plans include construction on the east side of the Ring Road. The goal is to accommodate an enrolment of 25,000.\n\nIn the summer of 2005 the University of Regina hosted the [[2005 Canada Games]].

Men's varsity teams include the Regina Rams (football), basketball, cross country, hockey, swimming, track and field, volleyball and wrestling. Women's varsity teams include basketball, cross country, hockey, soccer, swimming, track and field, volleyball, and wrestling. The University of Regina is also home to several varsity club teams, including cheerleading, curling, dance team, rowing, men's rugby sevens, women's rugby sevens, women's softball, synchronized swimming, ultimate, and triathlon.\n\nIn the summer of [[2005 Canada Games|2005]], the university hosted the [[Canada Summer Games]].\n\n==Media==\nThe university's [[student newspaper]] is ''[[The Carillon]]''. It for many years was an organ of radical student dissent and in the 1960s and 70s frequently had a very high community profile as its editorial postures occasioned vigorous denunciation by university administration figures and in the conservative general press. As student mores in subsequent generations have become less disputatious the ''Carillon'' has evolved into a less political paper which currently is a somewhat conventional newsletter of campus affairs.\n\nThe university is home to the School of Journalism, which was one of the first established in western Canada. The School publishes a student periodical, ''The Crow'', and hosts the annual Minifie lecture, in honour of one of Canada's most illustrious journalists, James M. Minifie (1900\u20131974).\n\nThe University of Regina does not have its own [[campus radio]] station, although the independent [[community radio]] station [[CJTR-FM]] actively solicits volunteers among the school's student body.\n\nThe University of Regina is home to the Interactive Media and Performance Labs ([[IMP Labs]]), which includes programming for the student body as well as members of the community. The Labs have been particularly recognized through the IMP Labs Hip Hop Project with [[Scott Collegiate]]. The directors of this program, Dr. Charity Marsh and Chris Beingessner, received the Lieutenant Governor's Arts Awards for Arts and Learning through the [[Saskatchewan Arts Board]].\n\n==Aboriginal==\nThe University of Regina provides services to Aboriginal people in more remote communities. The University of Regina's SUNTEP program was developed in partnership with specific Aboriginal communities to meet specific needs within Aboriginal communities. Aboriginal Elders are present on campus at University of Regina to provide social supports. Through the University of Regina's K\u00e2spohtamat\u00e2t\u00e2n Mentorship Program Aboriginal students act as role models to younger students still in their home communities.

The new campus was begun in 1966 on Wascana Lake, to the southeast of the old campus whose buildings, however, remain in use: the old Girls' Residence is now used by the Regina Conservatory of Music; the Normal School, having at various times housed not only the teacher-training facility that is now the University's Department of Education but the [[Royal Saskatchewan Museum|Saskatchewan Museum of Natural History]], war-training facilities during World War II when it was temporarily resumed by the federal crown and latterly the University's Fine Arts Department, is now the [[Canada-Saskatchewan Soundstage]].\n\nThe original design of Regina Campus (as of [[Wascana Centre]] itself) and its initial buildings, in a stark concrete [[modernist]] style, were by [[Minoru Yamasaki]], the architect of the original [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] in New York.<ref name=\"UofR\"/>\n\n{{clear}}\n;Yamasaki's original vision: \n{{quotation |[was that ...the buildings] would be located close enough together that passage between them in the winter could be provided through connecting corridors in the \"podium\" or first [ground] floor of all buildings in the central instructional complex.

Riddell Centre<ref name=\"UofR\" /> and the Normal School was substantially renovated to become the [[Canada-Saskatchewan Soundstage]].\n\nThe campus has experienced a recent spurt of growth and expansion, having been static for some two decades after the construction of the Language Institute at the end of the 1970s. Since the late 1990s, several new buildings have been added including the Dr. William A.

Many of the university undergraduate students are enrolled in the co-op program, with the highest percentage being in the faculties of science and engineering. The Faculty of Arts offers an innovative internship program for its undergraduate students.\n\n==Residences==\n[[File:College West.jpg|thumb|right|200px|College West viewed from the South Residence, across the Barber Academic Green]]\n\n[[File:U of R North and South Residences.jpg|thumb|right|250px|North and South Residences, from southwest on Oval]] \nRegina College originally housed male and female student residences which were converted to academic use when the college became affiliated with the University of Saskatchewan in 1934. (The old Girls' Residence now accommodates the Regina Conservatory of Music.)\n\nThe Main (Wascana) Campus has residence space for about 1,200 students on-campus. Each bedroom is single-occupant, but many spaces on campus are designed to facilitate double occupancy, increasing capacity if required to address high demand without building additional residence space. The University of Regina residences have enlivened campus life from the somewhat bleak atmosphere of its founding days:\n\n*College West, the first on-campus residential accommodation, constructed in 1972.<ref name=\"UofR\"/> Offers apartment-style residence living. The building also houses classrooms, academic and business offices and the Bookstore, previously located first in the Classroom Building and then the Administration Humanities Building.\n*La R\u00e9sidence in the Language Institute, gives priority to francophone students and those studying international languages.

Its teams bear the name \"[[Regina Cougars|Cougars]]\" in all sports, except the [[Regina Rams]], which were originally a community junior football team competing in PJFC football without affiliation with the university, and who joined University ranks in 1999 as a member of the Canada West Conference of U Sports. Men's varsity teams include the Regina Rams (football), basketball, cross country, hockey, swimming, track and field, volleyball and wrestling. Women's varsity teams include basketball, cross country, hockey, soccer, swimming, track and field, volleyball, and wrestling. The University of Regina is also home to several varsity club teams, including cheerleading, curling, dance team, rowing, men's rugby sevens, women's rugby sevens, women's softball, synchronized swimming, ultimate, and triathlon.\n\nIn the summer of [[2005 Canada Games|2005]], the university hosted the [[Canada Summer Games]].\n\n==Media==\nThe university's [[student newspaper]] is ''[[The Carillon]]''. It for many years was an organ of radical student dissent and in the 1960s and 70s frequently had a very high community profile as its editorial postures occasioned vigorous denunciation by university administration figures and in the conservative general press. As student mores in subsequent generations have become less disputatious the ''Carillon'' has evolved into a less political paper which currently is a somewhat conventional newsletter of campus affairs.\n\nThe university is home to the School of Journalism, which was one of the first established in western Canada. The School publishes a student periodical, ''The Crow'', and hosts the annual Minifie lecture, in honour of one of Canada's most illustrious journalists, James M. Minifie (1900\u20131974).\n\nThe University of Regina does not have its own [[campus radio]] station, although the independent [[community radio]] station [[CJTR-FM]] actively solicits volunteers among the school's student body.\n\nThe University of Regina is home to the Interactive Media and Performance Labs ([[IMP Labs]]), which includes programming for the student body as well as members of the community. The Labs have been particularly recognized through the IMP Labs Hip Hop Project with [[Scott Collegiate]]. The directors of this program, Dr. Charity Marsh and Chris Beingessner, received the Lieutenant Governor's Arts Awards for Arts and Learning through the [[Saskatchewan Arts Board]].\n\n==Aboriginal==\nThe University of Regina provides services to Aboriginal people in more remote communities. The University of Regina's SUNTEP program was developed in partnership with specific Aboriginal communities to meet specific needs within Aboriginal communities. Aboriginal Elders are present on campus at University of Regina to provide social supports. Through the University of Regina's K\u00e2spohtamat\u00e2t\u00e2n Mentorship Program Aboriginal students act as role models to younger students still in their home communities. The University of Regina has established an Aboriginal Career Centre to assist with the transition to a fulfilling career.<ref>[https://www.uwinnipeg.ca/index/cms-filesystem-action?file=pdfs/conferences/2007/aboriginal-rt-spring-report.pdf.

The main campus lies in La Tour Koenig, Pointe-aux-Sables, within the district of Moka. It was founded following the government of [[Mauritius]] approval of the setting up of the University of Technology, Mauritius in January 2000 and the proclamation of The University of Technology, Mauritius Act on 21 June 2000.\n\nUTM is a member of the [[Association of Commonwealth Universities]] and is listed in the Commonwealth Universities Handbook and in the International Handbook of Universities. UTM is a member of the [[Southern African Regional Universities Association]] (SARUA) - a network of public universities in the [[Southern African Development Community|SADC]] region.\n\n==Organisation==\n[[Image:Utm convocation.jpg|thumb|2008 Convocation Ceremony]] The setting up of the university began with the merging of two public training institutions, the Mauritius Institute of Public Administration and Management and the State Information Training Centre into schools. The School of Business Informatics and Software Engineering, the School of Public Sector Policy and Management and the School of Sustainable Development Science became operational in September 2000. The university started a restructuring process in September 2008. The schools were respectively renamed as School of Innovative Technologies and Engineering, School of Business Management and Finance and School of Sustainable Development and Tourism.\n\nIn-company training is part of the curriculum in the tourism management programmes. It offers programmes on a part-time and distance basis as well as flexible entry and exit points. Many of the programmes are occupationally or vocationally directed, for example, banking and finance, tourism management and marketing, and software engineering.\n\nIt offers short course programmes such as a full-time course for higher executive officers for 15 weeks. In this orientation and approach it differs from traditional universities in the SADC.<ref>Glenda Kruss and Il-haam Petersen.

The main campus lies in La Tour Koenig, Pointe-aux-Sables, within the district of Moka. It was founded following the government of [[Mauritius]] approval of the setting up of the University of Technology, Mauritius in January 2000 and the proclamation of The University of Technology, Mauritius Act on 21 June 2000.\n\nUTM is a member of the [[Association of Commonwealth Universities]] and is listed in the Commonwealth Universities Handbook and in the International Handbook of Universities. UTM is a member of the [[Southern African Regional Universities Association]] (SARUA) - a network of public universities in the [[Southern African Development Community|SADC]] region.\n\n==Organisation==\n[[Image:Utm convocation.jpg|thumb|2008 Convocation Ceremony]] The setting up of the university began with the merging of two public training institutions, the Mauritius Institute of Public Administration and Management and the State Information Training Centre into schools. The School of Business Informatics and Software Engineering, the School of Public Sector Policy and Management and the School of Sustainable Development Science became operational in September 2000. The university started a restructuring process in September 2008. The schools were respectively renamed as School of Innovative Technologies and Engineering, School of Business Management and Finance and School of Sustainable Development and Tourism.\n\nIn-company training is part of the curriculum in the tourism management programmes. It offers programmes on a part-time and distance basis as well as flexible entry and exit points. Many of the programmes are occupationally or vocationally directed, for example, banking and finance, tourism management and marketing, and software engineering.\n\nIt offers short course programmes such as a full-time course for higher executive officers for 15 weeks. In this orientation and approach it differs from traditional universities in the SADC.<ref>Glenda Kruss and Il-haam Petersen.
