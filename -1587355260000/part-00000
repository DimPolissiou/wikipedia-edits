Porrino joined [[Lowenstein Sandler]] as a partner in 2004, and served as vice chair of the firm's litigation department, focusing his practice on criminal and civil trials.\n\nIn 2012, Porrino left private practice for public service. He held a variety of positions at the State of New Jersey, including Director of the Division of Law from 2012 to 2014, Chief Counsel to [[Chris Christie]] from 2014 to 2015, and as the state's Attorney General from 2016 to 2018.\n\nAfter serving as the 60th Attorney General of New Jersey, Porrino returned to [[Lowenstein Sandler]] in 2018 as a partner and chair of the firm's litigation department. He is a crisis manager, having represented numerous private and public companies and individuals in alleged scandals, including Governor Christie during the [[Fort Lee lane closure scandal|\"Bridgegate\" scandal]], and currently represents individuals and businesses of all sizes in civil, criminal, and regulatory matters involving securities, consumer fraud, banking, insurance, tax, antitrust, real estate, and the environment. He also regularly conducts internal investigations for clients faced with allegations of wrongdoing by insiders.\n\nApproximately ten months after completing his term as Attorney General in a Republican administration, Porrino was hired by New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy (D) in October 2018 to represent his office in connection with an anticipated legislative inquiry  of Murphy and his administration. The state legislative panel was to be tasked with looking into certain hiring practices and an alleged sexual assault that occurred during the governor's campaign. The announcement of Porrino's hiring by the Murphy administration was applauded by legislative leaders who were driving the inquiry (\"Sweeney, Coughlin have no problems with Porrino,\" New Jersey Globe, October 22, 2018).\n\n==Christie administration==\nPorrino served as Director of the [[New Jersey Department of Law and Public Safety|Division of Law]] in the Attorney General's Office<ref name=NJ2012/> from February 2012 to January 2014, overseeing a team of 800 state employees, 500 of whom were lawyers.\n\nPorrino argued the landmark Harvey Cedars \u201cdunes\u201d case, before the [[New Jersey Supreme Court]]. The decision in 2013 paved the way for the state's shore protection and the dune construction projects that followed.\n\nFrom January 2014 through July 2015, Porrino served as Chief Counsel to the [[Governorship of Chris Christie|Christie administration]]. On his first day as Chief Counsel, the [[Fort Lee lane closure scandal]], known as \"Bridgegate\", broke in the news media. As Chief Counsel, Porrino navigated the Governor's Office through that crisis and the myriad legal issues that followed.  In that role, he also had broad responsibility overseeing appointments, legislative matters, and all state authorities.\n\nPorrino worked closely with Governor Christie and members of the [[New Jersey Legislature]] to secure the passage of numerous pieces of critical legislation, including the Criminal Justice Reform Act (i.e., bail reform).\n\nHe was involved in the state's controversial [[ExxonMobil-New Jersey environmental contamination settlement]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.njspotlight.com/stories/15/03/05/christie-aide-benefited-from-political-trip-before-settling-with-exxon|title=Christie Aide Took Political Trips Before Exxon Settlement - NJ Spotlight|publisher=|accessdate=17 June 2016}}</ref><ref>Burd, Joshua.

He also regularly conducts internal investigations for clients faced with allegations of wrongdoing by insiders.\n\nApproximately ten months after completing his term as Attorney General in a Republican administration, Porrino was hired by New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy (D) in October 2018 to represent his office in connection with an anticipated legislative inquiry  of Murphy and his administration. The state legislative panel was to be tasked with looking into certain hiring practices and an alleged sexual assault that occurred during the governor's campaign. The announcement of Porrino's hiring by the Murphy administration was applauded by legislative leaders who were driving the inquiry (\"Sweeney, Coughlin have no problems with Porrino,\" New Jersey Globe, October 22, 2018).\n\n==Christie administration==\nPorrino served as Director of the [[New Jersey Department of Law and Public Safety|Division of Law]] in the Attorney General's Office<ref name=NJ2012/> from February 2012 to January 2014, overseeing a team of 800 state employees, 500 of whom were lawyers.\n\nPorrino argued the landmark Harvey Cedars \u201cdunes\u201d case, before the [[New Jersey Supreme Court]]. The decision in 2013 paved the way for the state's shore protection and the dune construction projects that followed.\n\nFrom January 2014 through July 2015, Porrino served as Chief Counsel to the [[Governorship of Chris Christie|Christie administration]]. On his first day as Chief Counsel, the [[Fort Lee lane closure scandal]], known as \"Bridgegate\", broke in the news media. As Chief Counsel, Porrino navigated the Governor's Office through that crisis and the myriad legal issues that followed.  In that role, he also had broad responsibility overseeing appointments, legislative matters, and all state authorities.\n\nPorrino worked closely with Governor Christie and members of the [[New Jersey Legislature]] to secure the passage of numerous pieces of critical legislation, including the Criminal Justice Reform Act (i.e., bail reform).\n\nHe was involved in the state's controversial [[ExxonMobil-New Jersey environmental contamination settlement]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.njspotlight.com/stories/15/03/05/christie-aide-benefited-from-political-trip-before-settling-with-exxon|title=Christie Aide Took Political Trips Before Exxon Settlement - NJ Spotlight|publisher=|accessdate=17 June 2016}}</ref><ref>Burd, Joshua.

He targeted \u201cpill mills\u201d and professionals engaged in indiscriminate prescribing, resulting in more civil and criminal charges filed against medical professionals during his term than during any comparable period in the history of the department. He oversaw the expansion of the state's [[prescription monitoring program]] (PMP), including the implementation of mandatory PMP look-ups by prescribers and interconnectivity with PMPs from a number of other states.<ref name=\"nj.gov\">{{cite web|url=https://nj.gov/oag/newsreleases17/pr20170524c.html|title=State of New Jersey|website=nj.gov}}</ref>\n\nPorrino oversaw the implementation of bail reform in New Jersey.

In a case that received national attention, Porrino led a civil rights action against the Township of Mahwah wherein it was alleged that local officials engaged in a pattern of discrimination to exclude Orthodox Jews.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://patch.com/new-jersey/mahwah/state-files-lawsuit-against-mahwah-excluding-orthodox-jews-attorney-general|title=Mahwah Township Excluded Orthodox Jews, State Claims In Lawsuit|date=October 24, 2017|publisher=}}</ref> \n \nIn the area of juvenile justice, he led the planned closure of a Civil War-era youth prison as part of other important reforms of the state's juvenile justice system.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.insidernj.com/press-release/governor-christie-announces-unprecedented-investment-juvenile-justice-system/|title=Governor Christie Announces Unprecedented Investment in Juvenile Justice System - Insider NJ|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn the area of community policing, Porrino and the department implemented the first statewide community policing grant program, named in honor of fallen police officer Matthew Tarentino.

Byrne plays a geneticist who clones himself.\n\n== Plot ==\nAfter accidentally causing the death of his son, geneticist William Blakely wakes in a house tended by a man who introduces himself as his twin brother.  His brother explains that William was involved in a car crash.  William can remember nothing of his life and must be taught basic concepts, such as how to walk and respond to knock-knock jokes.  Together, they watch old footage of William and his twin as children.  Though William does not recognize his estranged wife Jules, he is entranced by her.  William's brother is finally called to return to work at Next Corp, and he leaves William alone in the house for the day.\n\nAt work, William's brother is revealed to be the real William Blakely \u2013 William 1.  He stole material from the lab to create a clone, William 2.  His assistant, Baxter, tells William 1 that their test subjects have been dying after mere weeks.  Before William 1 can do anything further, his boss, Dr. Archer, takes him to see several security agents, who accuse him of stealing the lab materials.  Dr. Archer supports him, but the security agents remain suspicious.  At the same time, William 2 explores the house and discovers enough evidence that he becomes confused about his origins and identity.  Further confusing William 2 is a phone call apparently from a haggard-sounding version of William (who is later revealed to be the original William, William Zero) who apologizes for leaving him and promises to return.\n\nWilliam 2 angrily confronts William 1.  After interrogating William 1, William 2 ties him up and leaves to find Jules, who he hopes can explain further.  Although overwhelmed by his first experiences in the world, William 2 quickly adapts and locates Jules.  He awkwardly reestablishes contact with her, though she initially rejects him, as she feels abandoned and left alone to deal with her grief.  William 2 secretly follows her around the city and becomes more smitten with her.  Meanwhile, William 1 escapes his bonds and kills a Next Corp security agent who was investigating the house and its grounds.  William 1 recovers a pistol from the agent's body and uses it to kill Dr. Archer.\n\nWilliam 1 quickly returns home and pretends to be bound.  When his clone arrives, he convinces William 2 to take over his life, as William 1 does not wish to return to it.  William 2 reluctantly agrees, and goes to work at Next Corp, where he learns that the animal test subjects are second generation clones.  Baxter explains that cloning a clone causes extensive genetic problems, and William 2, who is experiencing the described symptoms, realizes that he must be a second generation clone, too.  Before he can return home to further question William 1, a security team detains him for further questioning.  Baxter, dubious about the company's ethics, frees him and traps the security team.\n\nAfter growing increasingly suspicious of his neighbor's activities, Lester confronts William 1.  William 1 invites Lester inside, and, after pushing him down a flight of stairs, explains his origins.  The original William Blakely, William Zero, was so overcome by guilt and grief that he abandoned his wife and created a clone, William 1, to replace him.  However, William 1 felt abandoned by his creator once William Zero disappeared.  As he struggled through life with no help, he became bitter and disillusioned, eventually attempting suicide.  Unable to face his own broken life, William 1 created a clone to replace him \u2013 freeing him to seek vengeance on William Zero and the world.\n\nAfter killing Lester, William 1 lures Jules to the house, planning to kill her to spite William Zero.  Although confused by his cold demeanor compared to William 2, Jules does not suspect anything.  William 2 arrives before William 1 can kill Jules, and he tells Jules that he loves her.  After the two embrace, William 2 attempts to dispose of William 1's body, only to be confronted by William Zero.  Knowing he will soon die, William 2 convinces William Zero to return to his wife and promise never to leave her again.  William Zero tearfully agrees, and they arrange for his death to be faked.  Some time later, William Zero is shown together with Jules and his now-cloned son.\n\n== Cast ==\n* Conal Byrne as William 1, William 2, and William Zero\n* [[Amy Seimetz]] as Jules\n* Tim Habeger as Dr. Archer\n* Adam Fristoe as Mr. Langley\n* Scott Poythress as Lester\n* Lake Roberts as Baxter\n* [[Melissa McBride]] as Dr. Ashley Bronson\n* Jeff Rose as Mr. Penn\n* [[A.

Byrne plays a geneticist who clones himself.\n\n== Plot ==\nAfter accidentally causing the death of his son, geneticist William Blakely wakes in a house tended by a man who introduces himself as his twin brother.  His brother explains that William was involved in a car crash.  William can remember nothing of his life and must be taught basic concepts, such as how to walk and respond to knock-knock jokes.  Together, they watch old footage of William and his twin as children.  Though William does not recognize his estranged wife Jules, he is entranced by her.  William's brother is finally called to return to work at Next Corp, and he leaves William alone in the house for the day.\n\nAt work, William's brother is revealed to be the real William Blakely \u2013 William 1.  He stole material from the lab to create a clone, William 2.  His assistant, Baxter, tells William 1 that their test subjects have been dying after mere weeks.  Before William 1 can do anything further, his boss, Dr. Archer, takes him to see several security agents, who accuse him of stealing the lab materials.  Dr. Archer supports him, but the security agents remain suspicious.  At the same time, William 2 explores the house and discovers enough evidence that he becomes confused about his origins and identity.  Further confusing William 2 is a phone call apparently from a haggard-sounding version of William (who is later revealed to be the original William, William Zero) who apologizes for leaving him and promises to return.\n\nWilliam 2 angrily confronts William 1.  After interrogating William 1, William 2 ties him up and leaves to find Jules, who he hopes can explain further.  Although overwhelmed by his first experiences in the world, William 2 quickly adapts and locates Jules.  He awkwardly reestablishes contact with her, though she initially rejects him, as she feels abandoned and left alone to deal with her grief.  William 2 secretly follows her around the city and becomes more smitten with her.  Meanwhile, William 1 escapes his bonds and kills a Next Corp security agent who was investigating the house and its grounds.  William 1 recovers a pistol from the agent's body and uses it kill Dr. Archer.\n\nWilliam 1 quickly returns home and pretends to be bound.  When his clone arrives, he convinces William 2 to take over his life, as William 1 does not wish to return to it.  William 2 reluctantly agrees, and goes to work at Next Corp, where he learns that the animal test subjects are second generation clones.  Baxter explains that cloning a clone causes extensive genetic problems, and William 2, who is experiencing the described symptoms, realizes that he must be a second generation clone, too.  Before he can return home to further question William 1, a security team detains him for further questioning.  Baxter, dubious about the company's ethics, frees him and traps the security team.\n\nAfter growing increasingly suspicious of his neighbor's activities, Lester confronts William 1.  William 1 invites Lester inside, and, after pushing him down a flight of stairs, explains his origins.  The original William Blakely, William Zero, was so overcome by guilt and grief that he abandoned his wife and created a clone, William 1, to replace him.  However, William 1 felt abandoned by his creator once William Zero disappeared.  As he struggled through life with no help, he became bitter and disillusioned, eventually attempting suicide.  Unable to face his own broken life, William 1 created a clone to replace him \u2013 freeing him to seek vengeance on William Zero and the world.\n\nAfter killing Lester, William 1 lures Jules to the house, planning to kill her to spite William Zero.  Although confused by his cold demeanor compared to William 2, Jules does not suspect anything.  William 2 arrives before William 1 can kill Jules, and he tells Jules that he loves her.  After the two embrace, William 2 attempts to dispose of William 1's body, only to be confronted by William Zero.  Knowing he will soon die, William 2 convinces William Zero to return to his wife and promise never to leave her again.  William Zero tearfully agrees, and they arrange for his death to be faked.  Some time later, William Zero is shown together with Jules and his now-cloned son.\n\n== Cast ==\n* Conal Byrne as William 1, William 2, and William Zero\n* [[Amy Seimetz]] as Jules\n* Tim Habeger as Dr. Archer\n* Adam Fristoe as Mr. Langley\n* Scott Poythress as Lester\n* Lake Roberts as Baxter\n* [[Melissa McBride]] as Dr. Ashley Bronson\n* Jeff Rose as Mr. Penn\n* [[A.

Conflicts arose over operational matters, and all non-Navy personnel were reassigned. The unit, renamed [[7th Amphibious Scouts]], received a new mission, to go ashore with the assault boats, buoy channels, erect markers for the incoming craft, handle casualties, take offshore soundings, clear beach obstacles and maintain voice communications linking the troops ashore, incoming boats and nearby ships. The 7th Amphibious Scouts conducted operations in the Pacific for the duration of the conflict, participating in more than 40 landings.<ref name=\"Navy Seal History\"/>\n\nThe third and final Scouts and Raiders organization operated in China. Scouts and Raiders were deployed to fight with the [[Sino-American Cooperative Organization|Sino-American Cooperative Organization, or SACO]]. To help bolster the work of SACO, Admiral [[Ernest J. King]] ordered that 120 officers and 900 men be trained for \"Amphibious Raider\" at the Scout and Raider school at [[Fort Pierce, Florida]]. They formed the core of what was envisioned as a \"guerrilla amphibious organization of Americans and Chinese operating from coastal waters, lakes and rivers employing small steamboats and sampans.\" While most Amphibious Raider forces remained at [[Camp Knox]] in Calcutta, three of the groups saw active service. They conducted a survey of the upper [[Yangtze River]] in the spring of 1945 and, disguised as [[coolies]], conducted a detailed three-month survey of the Chinese coast from [[Shanghai]] to [[Kitchioh]] Wan, near [[Hong Kong]].<ref name=\"Navy Seal History\"/>\n\n=== Naval Combat Demolition Units ===\n[[File:Naval Combat Demolition Unit 45.jpg|thumb|NCDU 45, CEC Ensign Karnowski, Chief Carpenters Mate Conrad C.

On 10 November 1942, the first combat demolition unit successfully cut cable and net barriers across the Wadi Sebou River during [[Operation Torch]] in North Africa. This enabled {{USS|Dallas|DD-199}} to traverse the water and insert [[U.S. Rangers]] who captured the Port Lyautey airdrome.\n\nIn early May 1943, a two-phase \"Naval Demolition Project\" was directed by the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] \"to meet a present and urgent requirement\". The first phase began at Amphibious Training Base (ATB) Solomons, Maryland with the establishment of Operational Naval Demolition Unit No. 1. Six officers and eighteen enlisted men reported from the [[Seabee]]'s NTC [[Camp Peary]] dynamiting and demolition school, for a four-week course.

Most of Kauffman's volunteers came from the navy's [[Civil Engineer Corps]] (CEC) and enlisted seabees. Training commenced with a gruelling week designed to filter out under-performing candidates.\n\nBy April 1944, a total of 34 NCDUs were deployed to England in preparation for [[Operation Overlord]], the amphibious landing at [[Normandy]]. On 6 June 1944, under heavy fire, the NCDUs at [[Omaha Beach]] managed to blow eight complete gaps and two partial gaps in the German defenses. The NCDUs suffered 31 killed and 60 wounded, a casualty rate of 52%. Meanwhile, the NCDUs at [[Utah Beach]] met less intense enemy fire. They cleared {{convert|700|yd|m|abbr=off}} of beach in two hours, another {{convert|900|yd|m|abbr=off}} by the afternoon. Casualties at Utah Beach were significantly lighter with six killed and eleven wounded. During Operation Overlord, not a single demolitioneer was lost to improper handling of explosives. In August 1944,  four NCDUs from Utah Beach plus nine others participated in the landings [[Operation Dragoon]] in southern France.  It was the last amphibious operation in the [[European Theater of Operations]].  With Europe invaded Admiral Turner requisitioned all available NCDUs from Fort Pierce for integration into the UDTs for the Pacific.\n\nThirty NCDUs<ref name=\"UDT Cold\"/>  had been sent to the Pacific prior to Normandy.

In the Mediterranean, a fleet of hired Greek wooden fishing vessels\u2014called caiques\u2014covertly supported OSS agents in Albania, Greece, and Yugoslavia. After Italy surrendered, the MU and the San Marco battalion, an elite Italian special operations naval unit, operated against the Germans. In the Far East, the MU operated in conjunction with an Operational Group to attack Japanese forces on the Arakan coast of Burma. They jointly conducted reconnaissance missions on the Japanese-held coast, sometimes penetrating several miles up enemy-controlled rivers.<ref name=\"Maritime Unit\">{{cite web |last1=United States Army Special Operations Command |title=Maritime Unit |url=https://www.soc.mil/OSS/maritime-unit.html |website=soc.mil |accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe MU developed or used several innovative devices that would later allow for the creation of a special operations combat-diver capability, first in Army Special Forces (Green Berets) and later in US Navy SEAL units. Perhaps the most important invention in the realm of special operations diving was the [[LAR5|Lambertsen Rebreathing Unit]] (LARU) invented by [[Christian Lambertsen|Dr. Christian J. Lambertsen]]. The Lambertsen unit permitted a swimmer to remain underwater for several hours and to approach targets undetected because the LARU did not emit telltale air bubbles. The LARU was later refined, adapted, and the technology used by the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, and NASA. The Army Special Forces Underwater Operations School at Key West, Florida, the home of Special Forces maritime operations, draws its roots from the Maritime Unit.<ref name=\"Maritime Unit\"/>\n\nLambertsen began his involvement with the OSS as a medical student offering the use of his technology to the secretive organization in 1942.

They stripped down, spent 45 minutes in the water in broad daylight. When they got out were taken directly to Admiral Turners [[flagship]] to report, still in their trunks.

Beginning with a detachment of 11 personnel from UDT 3, UDT participation expanded to three teams with a combined strength of 300 men. During the \"Forgotten War\" the UDTs fought intensively, beginning to employ demolition expertise gained from WWII and use it for an offensive role. Continuing to use water as cover and concealment as well as an insertion method, the Korean Era UDTs targeted bridges, tunnels, fishing nets and other maritime and coastal targets. They also developed a close working relationship with the [[Republic of Korea]] [[Republic of Korea Navy Special Warfare Flotilla|Underwater Demolitions Unit (predecessor to the Navy Special Warfare Flotilla)]], which continues today.<ref name=\"Navy Seal History\"/>\n\nThe UDTs refined and developed their commando tactics during the Korean War, through their focused efforts on demolitions and mine disposal. The UDTs also accompanied South Korean commandos on raids in the North to demolish train tunnels. This was frowned upon by higher-ranking officials because they believed it was a non-traditional use of Naval forces. Due to the nature of the war the UDTs maintained a low operational profile. Some of the missions include transporting spies into North Korea and the destruction of North Korean fishing nets used to supply the North Korean Army.<ref name=\"Navy Seal History\"/>\n\nAs part of the Special Operations Group, or SOG, UDTs successfully conducted demolition raids on railroad tunnels and bridges along the Korean coast. The UDTs specialized in a somewhat new mission: Night coastal demolition raids against railroad tunnels and bridges. The UDT men were given the task because, in the words of UDT Lieutenant Ted Fielding, \"We were ready to do what nobody else could do, and what nobody else wanted to do.\" (Ted Fielding was awarded the Silver Star during Korea, and was later promoted to the rank of Captain).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://navysealmuseum.com/about-navy-seals/seal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-story/seal-history-underwater-demolition-teams-in-the-korean-war/ |title=SEAL History: Underwater Demolition Teams in the Korean War |website=National Navy UDT-SEAL Museum |accessdate=24 May 2014}}</ref> On 15 September 1950, UDTs supported Operation Chromite, the amphibious landing at Incheon. UDT 1 and 3 provided personnel who went in ahead of the landing craft, scouting mud flats, marking low points in the channel, clearing fouled propellers, and searching for mines. Four UDT personnel acted as wave-guides for the Marine landing. In October 1950, UDTs supported mine-clearing operations in Wonsan Harbor where frogmen would locate and mark mines for minesweepers. On 12 October 1950, two U.S. minesweepers hit mines and sank. UDTs rescued 25 sailors. The next day, William Giannotti conducted the first U.S. combat operation using an \"aqualung\" when he dove on {{USS|Pledge|AM-277|6}}. For the remainder of the war, UDTs conducted beach and river reconnaissance, infiltrated guerrillas behind the lines from sea, continued mine sweeping operations, and participated in Operation Fishnet, which devastated the North Koreans' fishing capability.<ref name=\"Navy Seal History\"/>\n\n=== Birth of Navy SEALs and the Vietnam War ===\n{{Main|Vietnam War}}\nPresident [[John F.

In a speech, to [[United States Congress|Congress]], on 25 May 1961, Kennedy spoke of his deep respect for the [[Special Forces (United States Army)|United States Army Special Forces]]. While his announcement of the government's [[Apollo program|plan to put a man on the moon]] drew most of the attention, in the same speech he announced his intention to spend over $100&nbsp;million to strengthen U.S. special operations forces and expand American capabilities in unconventional warfare. Some people erroneously credit President Kennedy with creating the Navy SEALs. His announcement was actually only a formal acknowledgement of a process that had been under way since Korea.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://navysealmuseum.com/about-navy-seals/seal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-story/genesis-of-the-u-s-navys-sea-air-land-seal-teams/ |title=Genesis of the U.S. Navy's SEa, Air, Land (SEAL) Teams |website=National Navy UDT-SEAL Museum |accessdate=24 May 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222183844/https://navysealmuseum.com/about-navy-seals/seal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-story/genesis-of-the-u-s-navys-sea-air-land-seal-teams/ |archivedate=22 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe Navy needed to determine its role within the special operations arena. In March 1961, [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Arleigh Burke]], the [[Chief of Naval Operations]], recommended the establishment of [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] and [[Counter-guerrilla warfare|counter-guerrilla]] units. These units would be able to operate from sea, air or land. This was the beginning of the Navy SEALs. All SEALs came from the Navy's [[Underwater Demolition Team]]s, who had already gained extensive experience in [[commando]] warfare in [[Korean War|Korea]]; however, the Underwater Demolition Teams were still necessary to the Navy's amphibious force.<ref name=\"Navy Seal History\" />\n\n[[File:Members of SEAL Delivery Vehicle Team Two (SDVT-2).jpg|thumb|Members of [[SDVT-2|SEAL Delivery Vehicle Team Two]] in a [[Dry Deck Shelter]] of the submerged {{USS|Philadelphia|SSN-690|6}}]]\nThe first two teams were formed in January 1962<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.mil/viewVideo.asp?id=17950 |title=Video gallery: Forged by Adversity |date=2 January 2013 |website=United States Navy |accessdate=24 May 2014}}</ref> and stationed on both US coasts: Team One at [[Naval Amphibious Base Coronado]], in San Diego, California and Team Two at [[Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek]], in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]]. Formed entirely with personnel from UDTs, the SEALs mission was to conduct counter guerilla warfare and clandestine operations in maritime and riverine environments.<ref name=\"Navy Seals History sealswcc.com\"/> Men of the newly formed SEAL Teams were trained in such unconventional areas as [[hand-to-hand combat]], [[HALO jump|high-altitude parachuting]], [[demolitions]], and foreign languages. The SEALs attended Underwater Demolition Team replacement training and they spent some time training in UDTs. Upon making it to a SEAL team, they would undergo a SEAL Basic Indoctrination (SBI) training class at Camp Kerry in the [[Cuyamaca Peak|Cuyamaca Mountains]]. After SBI training class, they would enter a [[platoon]] and conduct platoon training.\n\nAccording to founding SEAL team member [[Roy Boehm]], the SEALs' first missions were directed against communist Cuba. These consisted of deploying from submarines and carrying out beach reconnaissance in prelude to a proposed US amphibious invasion of the island. On at least one occasion Boehm and another SEAL smuggled a CIA agent ashore to take pictures of Soviet nuclear missiles being unloaded on the dockside.<ref>{{cite book |title=First SEAL |first1=Ray |last1=Boehm |first2=Charles |last2=Sasser |year=1997 |location=New York |publisher=Pocket Books |isbn=978-0-67153-625-1 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[United States Pacific Command|Pacific Command]] recognized [[Vietnam]] as a potential hot spot for unconventional forces. At the beginning of 1962, the UDTs started [[hydrographic survey]]s and along with other branches of the US Military, the [[Military Assistance Command Vietnam]] (MACV) was formed. In March 1962, SEALs were deployed to [[South Vietnam]] as advisors for the purpose of training [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] [[commando]]s in the same methods they were trained themselves.\n\nThe [[Central Intelligence Agency]] began using SEALs in [[covert operation]]s in early 1963. The SEALs were involved in the CIA sponsored [[Phoenix Program]] where it targeted key North Vietnamese Army personnel and [[Vietcong]] sympathizers for capture and assassination.\n\nThe SEALs were initially deployed in and around [[Da Nang]], training the South Vietnamese in combat diving, demolitions, and guerrilla/anti-guerrilla tactics. As the war continued, the SEALs found themselves positioned in the [[Rung Sat Special Zone]] where they were to disrupt the enemy supply and troop movements and in the [[Mekong Delta]] to fulfill [[Brown-water navy|riverine]] operations, fighting on the inland waterways.\n\n[[File:NavySeal1967Vietnam.jpg|thumb|left|SEALs on patrol in the [[Mekong Delta]]]]\nCombat with the [[National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam|Viet Cong]] was direct. Unlike the conventional warfare methods of firing artillery into a coordinate location, the SEALs operated close to their targets. Into the late 1960s, the SEALs were successful in a new style of warfare, effective in anti-guerrilla and guerrilla actions. SEALs brought a personal war to the enemy in a previously safe area. The Viet Cong referred to them as \"the men with green faces,\" due to the [[camouflage]] [[Body painting#Use in military|face paint]] the SEALs wore during combat missions.<ref>{{cite book |title=Point Man |first1=James |last1=Watson |first2=Kevin |last2=Dockery |year=1993 |location=New York |publisher=Avon Books |isbn=0-380-71986-X}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1966, a small SEAL Team One detachment arrived in Vietnam to conduct direct actions missions. Operating from [[Nh\u00e0 B\u00e8 Base]], near the R\u1eebng S\u00e1c Special Zone, this detachment signaled the beginning of a SEAL presence that would eventually include 8 SEAL platoons in country on a continuing basis.

The SEALs from Team Two started a unique deployment of SEAL team members working alone with South Vietnamese Commandos ([[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|ARVN]]). In 1967, a SEAL unit named Detachment Bravo (Det Bravo) was formed to operate these mixed US and ARVN units, which were called South Vietnamese [[Provincial Reconnaissance Unit]]s (PRUs).\n\n[[File:Presidential Unit Citation SEAL TEAM TWO 1969-1971.jpg|thumb|[[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] awarded to SEAL Team TWO for extraordinary heroism in Vietnam from July 1969 to June 1971.]]\n\nBy 1970, President [[Richard Nixon]] initiated a Plan of [[Role of United States in the Vietnam War#Vietnamization, 1969\u20131975|Vietnamization]], which would remove the US from the Vietnam War and return the responsibility of defense back to the South Vietnamese. Conventional forces were being withdrawn; the last SEAL platoon left Vietnam on 7 December 1971, the last SEAL advisor, left Vietnam in March 1973. South Vietnam fell to North Vietnamese communist forces in April 1975. The SEALs were among the highest decorated units for their size in the war, receiving by 1974 one [[Medal of Honor]], two [[Navy Cross]]es, 42 [[Silver star]]s, 402 [[Bronze Star]]s, two [[Legions of Merit]], 352 Commendation Medals, and 51 Navy Achievement Medals<ref name=\"SEAL Combat Manual\">{{Cite book |author= |title=US Navy SEAL Combat Manual |year=1974 |page=xvi |url=https://www.federaljack.com/ebooks/US-Navy-SEAL-Combat-Manual.pdf |access-date=25 January 2019 }}.</ref> Later awards would bring the total to three Medals of Honor and five Navy Crosses.

The SEALs' two primary missions were the extraction of Grenada's [[Paul Scoon|Governor-General]] and the capture of Grenada's only radio tower. Neither mission was well briefed or sufficiently supported with timely intelligence and the SEALs ran into trouble from the very beginning. On 24 October 1983, twelve operators from SEAL Team Six and four Air Force Combat Control Team members (CCT) conducted a predawn combat airborne water insertion from C130 Hercules with Zodiac inflatable rubber boats 40 kilometers north of Point Salines, Grenada. The team inserted with full combat gear in bad weather with low visibility conditions and high winds. Four SEALs drowned and were never recovered. SEALs split into two teams and proceeded to their objectives. After digging in at the Governor's mansion, the SEALs realized they had forgotten to load their [[Cryptography|cryptographic]] [[satellite phone]]. As Grenadian and Cuban troops surrounded the team, the SEALs' only radio ran out of battery power, and they used the mansion's land line telephone to call in [[AC-130]] gunship fire support. The SEALs were pinned down in the mansion overnight and were relieved and extracted by a group of Marines the following morning.\n\nThe team sent to the radio station also ran into communication problems. As soon as the SEALs reached the radio facility they found themselves unable to raise their command post. After beating back several waves of Grenadian and Cuban troops supported by [[BTR-60]] armoured personnel carriers, the SEALs decided that their position at the radio tower was untenable. They destroyed the station and fought their way to the water where they hid from patrolling enemy forces. After the enemy had given up their search the SEALs, some wounded, swam into the open sea where they were extracted several hours later after being spotted by a reconnaissance aircraft.\n\n===Iran\u2013Iraq War===\n{{Main|Operation Prime Chance}}\nDuring the closing stages of the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] the United States Navy began conducting operations in the [[Persian Gulf]] to protect US-flagged ships from attack by Iranian naval forces. A secret plan was put in place and dubbed [[Operation Prime Chance]]. Navy SEAL Teams 1 and 2 along with several Special Boat Units and EOD techs were deployed on mobile command barges and transported by helicopters from the [[160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (United States)|Army's 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment]]. Over the course of the operation SEALs conducted [[VBSS]] (Visit, Board, Search, and Seizure) missions to counter Iranian mine laying boats. The only loss of life occurred during the take down of the ''[[Iran Ajr]]<!--Not a spelling error, this is the name of a ship-->''. Evidence gathered on the ''Iran Ajr'' by the SEALs later allowed the US Navy to trace the mines that struck {{USS|Samuel B. Roberts|FFG-58}}. This chain of events led to [[Operation Praying Mantis]], the largest US Naval surface engagement since the Second World War.\n\nDuring Operation Desert Shield and Storm, Navy SEALs trained Kuwaiti Special Forces. They set up naval special operations groups in Kuwait, working with the Kuwaiti Navy in exile. Using these new diving, swimming, and combat skills, these commandos took part in combat operations such as the liberation of the capital city.\n\n===Panama===\n{{Main|United States invasion of Panama}}\n[[File:US Navy 100107-N-0000X-003 Members of Seal Team 4 pose for a group photo before Operation Just Cause.jpg|thumb|Members of SEAL Team 4 immediately before the start of Operation Just Cause]]\nThe United States Navy contributed extensive special operations assets to the invasion of Panama, codenamed [[Operation Just Cause]]. This included SEAL Teams 2 and 4, Naval Special Warfare Unit 8, and Special Boat Unit 26, all falling under Naval Special Warfare Group 2; and the separate [[Naval Special Warfare Development Group]] (DEVGRU). DEVGRU fell under Task Force Blue, while Naval Special Warfare Group 2 composed the entirety of Task Force White. Task Force White was tasked with three principal objectives: the destruction of [[Panamanian Defense Forces]] (PDF) naval assets in Balboa Harbor and the destruction of [[Manuel Noriega]]'s private jet at Paitilla Airport (collectively known as [[Operation Nifty Package]]), as well as isolating PDF forces on Flamenco Island.\n\nThe strike on Balboa Harbor by Task Unit Whiskey is notably marked in SEAL history as the first publicly acknowledged combat swimmer mission since the Second World War. Prior to the commencement of the invasion four Navy SEALs, Lt Edward S. Coughlin, EN-3 Timothy K. Eppley, ET-1 Randy L. Beausoleil, and PH-2 Chris Dye, swam underwater into the harbor on Draeger LAR-V [[rebreathers]] and attached [[C-4 (explosive)|C4 explosives]] to and destroyed Noriega's personal gunboat the ''Presidente Porras''.\n\nTask Unit Papa was tasked with the seizure of Paitilla airfield and the destruction of Noriega's plane there. Several SEALs were concerned about the nature of the mission assigned to them being that airfield seizure was usually the domain of the [[75th Ranger Regiment (United States)|Army Rangers]]. Despite these misgivings and a loss of operational surprise, the SEALs of TU Papa proceeded with their mission. Almost immediately upon landing, the 48 SEALs came under withering fire from the PDF stationed at the airfield. Although Noriega's plane was eventually destroyed, the SEALs suffered four dead and thirteen wounded. Killed were Lt. John Connors, Chief Petty Officer [[Donald L. McFaul|Donald McFaul]], Torpedoman's Mate 2nd Class Issac Rodriguez, and Boatswain's Mate 1st Class Chris Tilghman.\n\n===Persian Gulf War===\n{{main|Gulf War}}\nIn August 1990, SEALs were the first western forces to deploy to the [[Persian Gulf]] as part of [[Gulf War#Operation Desert Shield|Operation Desert Shield]]. They infiltrated the capital city of [[Kuwait]] within hours of the invasion and gathered intelligence and developed plans to rescue US embassy staff should they become hostages. SEALs were also the first to capture Iraqi Prisoners of War when they assaulted nine Kuwaiti Oil platforms on 19 January 1991. On 23 February 1991, a seven-man SEAL team launched a mission to trick the Iraqi military into thinking an amphibious assault on Kuwait by coalition forces was imminent by setting off explosives and placing marking buoys 500 meters off the Kuwaiti coast. The mission was a success and Iraqi forces were diverted east away from the true coalition offensive.{{sfnp|Cawthorne|2008}} The SEALs were first into Kuwait City in their [[Desert Patrol Vehicle]]s when it was recaptured.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|p=14}}\n\n===Somalia Intervention===\nOn 6 December 1992, as part of [[Unified Task Force|Operation Restore Hope]], U.S. Navy SEALs and Special Boat crewmen from Naval Special Warfare Task Unit TRIPOLI began a three-day operation carrying out reconnaissance operations in the vicinity of [[Mogadishu]] airport and harbor; ahead of UNITAFs deployment to the country.

SEAL Teams 3 and 8 also began rotating into Oman from the United States and staging on the island of [[Masirah Island|Masirah]] for operations in Afghanistan. One of the SEALs' immediate concerns was their lack of suitable vehicles to conduct [[special reconnaissance]] (SR) missions in the rough, landlocked terrain of Afghanistan. After borrowing and retrofitting Humvees from the [[75th Ranger Regiment|Army Rangers]] also staging on Masirah, the SEALs inserted into Afghanistan to conduct the SR of what would become [[Camp Rhino]], as part of [[Operation Enduring Freedom#Operation Enduring Freedom \u2013 Afghanistan (OEF-A)|Operation Enduring Freedom \u2013 Afghanistan]] (OEF-A). These early stages of OEF were commanded by a fellow SEAL, [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Albert Calland]].\n\n[[File:US Navy SEALs at Zhawar Kili cave entrance.jpg|thumb|Task Force K-Bar SEALs at one of the entrances to the [[Zhawar Kili]] cave complex]]\nAs part of the CJSOTF (Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force) under the command of General [[Tommy Franks]] at [[CENTCOM]] SEALs from DEVGRU were part of Task Force Sword, which was established in early October 2001. It was a [[Black operation|black]] SOF (Special Operations Forces) unit under direct command of [[JSOC]]. It was a so-called hunter-killer force whose primary objective was of capturing or killing senior leadership and HVT within both al-Qaeda and the Taliban. Sword was initially structured around a two-squadron component of operators from Delta Force (Task Force Green) and DEVGRU (Task Force Blue) supported by a Ranger protection force teams (Task Force Red) and ISA signals intercept and surveillance operators (Task Force Orange) and the 160th SOAR (Task Force Brown). [[Task Force K-Bar]] was established on 10 October 2001, it was formed around a Naval Special Warfare Group consisting of SEALs from SEAL Teams 2, 3 and 8 and Green Berets from 1st Battalion, [[3rd Special Forces Group (United States)|3rd SFG]]; the task force was led by SEAL Captain [[Robert Harward]].\n\nThe task force's principal task was to conduct SR and [[Site Exploitation|SSE]] missions in the south of the country. Other Coalition SOF-particularly [[Kommando Spezialkr\u00e4fte|KSK]], [[Joint Task Force 2|JTF2]] and [[New Zealand Special Air Service]] were assigned to the task force. As part of the JIATF-CT (Joint Interagency Task Force-Counterterrorism) \u2013 intelligence integration and fusion activity manned by personnel from all Operation Enduring Freedom \u2013 Afghanistan (OEF-A) participating units- SEALs from DEVGRU were part of Task Force Bowie, they were embedded in the task force in AFOs (Advanced Force Operations). The AFOs were 45-man reconnaissances units made up of a Delta Force recce specialists augmented by selected SEALs from [[DEVGRU]] and supported by [[Intelligence Support Activity|ISA]]'s technical experts. The AFOs had been raised to support TF Sword and were tasked with intelligence preparation of the battlefield, working closely with the CIA and reported directly to Task Force Sword. The AFOs conducted covert reconnaissance \u2013 sending small 2 or 3 man teams into al-Qaeda 'Backyard' along the border with Pakistan, the AFO operators would deploy observation posts to watch and report enemy movements and numbers as well as environmental reconnaissance; much of the work was done on foot or [[All-terrain vehicle|ATVs]].{{sfnp|Neville|2015|pp=25-31}}\n\nSEALs were present at the [[Battle of Qala-i-Jangi]] in November 2001 alongside their counterparts from the British [[Special Boat Service|SBS]]. Chief Petty Officer [[Stephen Bass]] was awarded the [[Navy Cross]] for his actions during the battle.\n\nBefore the US Marines landed at [[Camp Rhino]] in November 2001, a SEAL recce team from [[SEAL Team 8]] conducted reconnaissance of the area, they were mistakenly engaged by orbiting [[Bell AH-1 SuperCobra|AH-1W attack helicopters]], but the SEALs managed to get a message through to the Marines before they suffered casualties.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|p=44}} The SR mission in the region of Camp Rhino lasted for four days, after which two [[United States Air Force Combat Control Team]]s made a nighttime [[HALO jump]] to assist the SEALs in guiding in [[U.S. Marine Corps|Marines]] from the [[15th Marine Expeditionary Unit]] who seized control of the area and established a [[Forward operating base]].\n\n====Post-invasion====\n[[File:US Navy SEALs in Khawar Kili.jpg|thumb|left|Task Force K-Bar SEALs searching munitions found in the [[Zhawar Kili]] cave complex]]\nIn January 2002, following the [[Battle of Tora Bora]], another series of caves was discovered in [[Zhawar Kili]], just south of [[Tora Bora]]; airstrikes hit the sites before SOF teams were inserted into the area. A SEAL platoon from SEAL Team 3, including several of their Desert Patrol Vehicles, accompanied by a German KSK element, a Norwegian SOF team and [[JTF2]] reconnaissance teams spent some nine days conducting extensive SSE, clearing an estimated 70 caves and 60 structures in the area, recovering a huge amount of both intelligence and munitions, but they didn't encounter any al-Qaeda fighters.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|pp=49-50 & 77}} Subsequent SEAL operations during the invasion of Afghanistan were conducted within Task Force K-Bar, a joint special operations unit of [[United States Army Special Forces|Army Special Forces]], [[Air Force Special Operations Command|United States Air Force Special Tactics Teams]], and special operations forces from Norway, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and Denmark. Task Force K-Bar conducted combat operations in the massive cave complexes near the city of [[Kandahar]] and surrounding territory, the town of Prata Ghar and hundreds of miles of rough terrain in southern and eastern Afghanistan. Over the course of six months Task Force K-Bar killed or captured over 200 Taliban and al Qaeda fighters, and destroyed tens of thousands of pounds of weapons and ordnance.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nIn February 2002, while at Camp Rhino, the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] passed on intelligence from a [[Predator drone]] operating in the [[Paktia]] province that [[Taliban]] Mullah [[Khirullah Said Wali Khairkhwa]] was spotted leaving a building by vehicle convoy. SEALs and Danish [[J\u00e6gerkorpset]] commandos boarded Air Force [[Pave Low]] helicopters and seized Khairkhwa on the road less than two hours later.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|p=78}} The SEALs continued to perform reconnaissance operations for the Marines until leaving after having spent 45 days on the ground.\n\nIn March 2002, SEALs from DEVGRU, SEAL Team 2, 3 and 8 participated extensively in [[Operation Anaconda]].

Their role was to conduct heliborne direct action raids, particularly against HVTs. The Naval Special Operations Task Group was assigned to Operation Iraqi Freedom, and was built around a core of SEAL Teams 8 and 10, Polish [[GROM]], [[Royal Marines]] from [[40 Commando|40]] and [[42 Commando]] under the command of [[3 Commando Brigade]] and attached [[United States Army Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Command|US Psy Ops and civil affairs]] teams. The Naval Task Group was principally tasked with the capture of the port of [[Umm Qasr]], Iraq's only deep-water port; the oil pipeline facilities of the [[Al-Faw Peninsula]]; and the two off-shore platforms the pipelines fed. Once these initial target sets were secured, the Task Group would support conventional forces in the south, conducting reconnaissance and raiding activities. Aviation support was provided by both Marine air of the 15th MEU and [[20th Special Operations Squadron]].{{sfnp|Neville|2015|p=96}}\n\nSeveral days before the beginning of the invasion, two SDV teams were launched from [[Mark V Special Operations Craft]] in the Persian Gulf. Their objectives were the [[Hydrographic survey|hydrographic reconnaissance]] of the [[KAAOT|Al Basrah (MABOT) and Khawr Al Amaya (KAAOT) Oil Terminals]]. After swimming under the terminals and securing their [[SEAL Delivery Vehicle|Mark 8 mod 1s]], the SDV SEALs spent several hours taking pictures and surveying Iraqi activity on both platforms before returning to their boats.{{sfnp|Cawthorne|2008}} On 20 March 2003, SEALs from SEAL Team 8 and 10 (31 SEALs, 2 [[United States Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal|Navy EOD]] a USAF combat controller and several Iraqi interpreters) moved to seize the MABOT oil terminal whilst GROM operators assaulted the KAAOT Oil Terminals. The terminals were quickly seized with no casualties, and explosives which were found on the terminals were made safe by GROM operators.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|p=123}}\n\nThe shore-based pumping stations (known as MMS-Monitoring and Meter Stations) and their pipelines on the Al-Faw Peninsula were [[Battle of Al Faw (2003)|seized by]] 12 SEALS from SEAL Team 3, who were mounted in DPVs. They took off from Kuwait and were inserted under Iraqi anti-aircraft fire by MH-53 helicopters. The target area was 'softened up' by [[Joint Direct Attack Munition|JDAM]] bombs dropped from [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52s]] on Iraqi bunkers, trenches and dugouts around the oil facilities. After a brief firefight in which the SEALs killed 1 Iraqi soldier and captured 13, the SEALs secured the MMS and the pipelines, and were relieved by Royal Marines from 40 Commando. The SEALs advised the Marines, helping coordinate [[Lockheed AC-130|AC-130 Spectres]] fire support onto Iraqi forces. The other shore-based pumping station at Umm Qasr was secured by SEALs and Royal Marines; before they landed, AC-130 Spectres and [[Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II|A-10As]] engaged a nearby [[Surface-to-air missile|SAM]] installation and a responding Iraqi mechanised unit. The SEALs secured the facility itself whilst the Royal Marines cleared Iraqi bunkers, killing several Iraqi soldiers.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|pp=123-126}}{{sfnp|Rossiter|2009|pp=149, 153 & 158-162}}{{sfnp|Kyle|2013}}\n\nOther Naval Task Group operations included elements of three SEAL platoons in GMV trucks and DPVs seizing the al Zubayr MMS, whilst [[I Marine Expeditionary Force|I MEF]] attacked the Rumaylah Oil Fields north of al-Faw. SEALs and [[Special warfare combatant-craft crewmen|Special Boat teams]] helped secure the Khawr Abd Allah and Khawr Az Zubyar waterways, which enabled humanitarian supplies to be delivered to the port of Umm Qasr. SEALs from the unit that secured the al-Faw MMS also conducted reconnaissance on the Shat Al Arab waterway, that was later secured by British forces. SEALs were also involved in various VBSS missions with British and Australian forces to seize Iraqi craft carrying seaborne mines.{{sfnp|Cawthorne|2008}}{{sfnp|Kyle|2013}}{{sfnp|Neville|2015|pp=126-127}}\n\nCoalition military planners were concerned that retreating Iraqi forces would destroy the Mukatayin hydroelectric dam, located 57 miles northeast of Baghdad, in an attempt to slow advancing US troops. In addition to restricting the manoeuvre of Coalition forces, the destruction of the dam would deny critical power needs to the surrounding area, as well as cause massive flooding and loss of Iraqi civilian life. A mixed team of SEALs from SEAL Team 5 and Polish GROM was called in to seize the dam. This force was flown several hours by six US Air Force [[Sikorsky MH-53|MH-53J Pave Lows]]; the force consisted of 20 SEALs (with an extra six SEAL snipers in one helicopter carrying the SEAL command and control element) and two EOD operators along with 35 GROM operators to the dam. The SEALs employed DPVs into blocking positions to defend against counter-attack and roving bands of Iranian bandits that had been crossing the border and raiding Iraqi towns. As in Al Faw, the SEALs found their DPVs (the SEAL unit at the al-Faw MMS lost all but two DPVs when they were bogged down in the oily mud) to be ineffective and this marked the last time they would employ them in Iraq. The SEALs and GROM on foot fast-roped out of their helicopters and immediately stormed the dam. The minimal{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=September 2017}} Iraqi troops guarding the dam surrendered without a fight, and with the exception of a GROM [[soldier]] who broke an ankle during the insertion, no casualties were sustained in the operation. After several hours of searching the dam for remaining hostile forces or any explosives, the SEALs secured the dam and held it for five days until they were relieved by advancing elements of the US Army.{{sfnp|Kyle|2013}}{{sfnp|Neville|2015|p=127}}{{sfnp|Rossiter|2009|p=161}}<ref>{{cite book |title=No Easy Day: The Autobiography of a Navy Seal: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden |first=Mark |last=Owen |year=2012 |location=New York |publisher=Dutton Books |page=[https://archive.org/details/noeasyday00mark/page/49 49] |isbn=978-0-52595-372-2 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Basra (2003)|Battle of Basra]], SEALs along with the [[Brigade Patrol Troop|Brigade Reconnaissance Force]] and [[539 Assault Squadron RM]] attempted a waterborne approach to [[Basra]] via the Shatt al-Arab waterway but were intercepted by [[Islamic Republic of Iran Navy|Iranian Revolutionary Guard]] patrol craft and did not want to engage them so they withdrew. On 6 April 2003, after relocating further up the waterway they successfully infiltrated via the waterway, using SEAL UAVs they called in \"show-of-force\" and an airstrike by a USMC harrier on Iraqi troops, the SEALs then headed to \"[[Ali Hassan al-Majid|Chemical Ali]]'s\" house with SSE teams to find traces of chemical weapons.{{sfnp|Rossiter|2009|pp=325\u2013328}} SEALs carried out missions around [[Nasiriyah]], carrying out reconnaissance on surrounding villages and engaging enemy strong points bypassed by the US Marine advance. Charlie Platoon, SEAL Team 3, later operated ahead of the Marine advance carrying out similar missions.{{sfnp|Kyle|2013}} SEAL and GROM units continued to cooperate throughout the rest of the invasion phase, with raids and anti-sniper missions in [[Baghdad]].{{sfnp|Neville|2015|p=126}}\n\n====Post-invasion Iraq====\n[[File:SEAL Michael A.

This photo was taken during an extraction after a firefight, and the smoke was used to conceal their movements from the enemy.]]\n\nFollowing the invasion, SEAL platoons rotated through [[Iraq]], conducting overwatch for US and Iraqi patrols and directly mentoring local Iraqi forces; they also conducted surveillance and sniping missions into known trouble spots. In September 2004, a SEAL sniper element was tasked with establishing an overwatch and surveillance position overlooking [[Haifa Street]], they were inserted by [[M2 Bradley|Bradley IFVs]] from a unit of the [[9th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|9th Cavalry Regiment]], however they were spotted and engaged by insurgents. The SEALs notified the Bradleys, they drove back, fired on the insurgents and set up a cordon for the SEALs to be extracted, one Bradley was destroyed by a car bomb, there were no casualties and the SEALs were extracted.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|pp=178-179}}\n\nIn the interim between the First Battle of Fallujah and [[Second Battle of Fallujah]], insurgents in [[Fallujah]] knew that the coalition assault was inevitable and under the guidance of the influx of foreign fighters, began to build defensive networks throughout the city-ranging from fortified buildings, trench lines, [[berm]]s, strategically placed [[car bomb]]s and [[Improvised explosive device|IEDs]]. In preparations for the second battle, SEALs conducted reconnaissance near the berms and tested out reports that the insurgents were equipped with night-vision equipment, they proved this by throwing an infra-red chemical light into the street which drew small arms fire. SEALs along with the [[5th Special Forces Group (United States)|5th SFG]], [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Marine Force Recon]] and [[MCSOCOM Detachment One|Det One]] and other JSOC elements were heavily involved in shaping operations prior to the 7 November [[D-Day (military term)|D-DAY]] when coalition forces entered the city. The SOF shaping included sophisticated feints to mislead the insurgents as to the direction of the final assault, close target reconnaissance and direct-action missions where a logistics node or IED factory was targeted. When the offensive on the insurgents in the city began, many of the US Marine companies had SEAL sniper teams attached to them, mainly from SEAL Teams 3, 5 and 10.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|pp=175-178}}\n\nFrom 2005, SEALs were heavily committed to western Iraq in [[Al Anbar Governorate]], [[Tanzim Qaidat al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Rafidayn|AQI]] terrorists who escaped Fallujah had relocated to [[Ramadi]]. A SEAL Task Unit was co-located with the Marines at [[Al Asad Airbase]] and sent elements to Ramadi and [[Habbaniyah]], the SEALs were initially tasked with target development for the Marines and providing sniper overwatch for their patrols. The SEALs were already training an Iraqi Army unit in Habbaniyah, although [[Foreign internal defense|FID]] was their main focus until later that year. A SEAL Task Unit generally comprised two individual SEAL Platoons: each Platoon was made up of seven-man squad elements commanded by a [[junior officer]], three of these Task Units (although a fourth was often added) along with a Special Boat Team detachment and a Headquarters Team (including integral intelligence, targeting and EOD personnel) made up a Naval Special Warfare Squadron. According to [[Dick Couch]], the SEALs began FID with two Iraqi units-the Army Scouts who conducted conventional reconnaissance missions, and the SMP (Special Missions Platoon), a locally formed unit that would later fight alongside the SEALs. Despite several challenges, the SEALs were soon conducted operations with partnered units, particularly in Special Reconnaissance, focusing on the surveillance aspect, whilst conventional US Army or Marines would conduct raids and arrests.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|pp=179-180}} The typical loadout of the SEALs in Ramadi included the M4 carbine, optimised for close quarter battle with a 10-inch barrel equipped with a 6-inch sound suppressor, Surefire flashlight and EOTech sight, short barrel and foregrip and seven magazines.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://corpidelite.net/afm/2017/05/a-navy-seal-loadout-in-ramadi/ |title=A Navy SEAL loadout in Ramadi |website=Corpi d'\u00e9lite.net |language=en-US |access-date=1 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nAs the SEALs were beginning to make headway in Ramadi, AQI was starting to infiltrate the area by targeting local [[Sheikh]]s and convincing them to allow jihadists to marry into local tribes, thus cementing their powerbase and Sheikhs that resisted these advances were met with typical AQI brutality. Al-Qaeda's efforts to install a [[Sharia]]-style shadow government in Ramadi led to AQI's downfall-when in the first half of 2006, in the run-up to the [[Battle of Ramadi (2006)|Second Battle of Ramadi]] SEALs, increasingly partnered with conventional forces of the [[1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division]] which was planning the offensive. SEALs along with the Scouts and SMP, would conduct reconnaissance, surveillance and sniper overwatch tasks; with their own targeting cell, they also began conducting raids on local insurgent leaders. The 1st BCT began the concerted offensive to clear Ramadi of AQI fighters; on 29 September 2006, whilst at a rooftop overwatch position, Petty Officer [[Michael A. Monsoor]] died after leaping upon an enemy grenade during a rooftop firefight, two SEALs on the roof were badly wounded from the grenade fragments and their local Iraqi Scouts ran back into the cover of the building, a fourth SEAL (only lightly wounded), managed to radio his colleagues and get the Scouts to return fire. A SEAL element in a second overwatch position immediately ran through heavy fire to reach Monsoor (whom later died from his wounds in the back of a Bradley IFV) and the wounded SEALs, Monsoor was later awarded the Medal of Honor and the Silver Star. The advances by conventional forces and the SEALs in Ramadi, combined with the brutal tactics of AQI, helped to increase recruitment in a local police initiative-the programme was designed to bring the local Sheikhs' militias into the Iraqi Security Forces. These volunteers would serve locally in their communities to defend them against al-Qaeda, a month after the kidnapping and murder of Sheikh Khalid by AQI (which proved to be the tipping point), the Sheikhs signed a declaration agreeing to fight AQI and by the closing of 2006, even former insurgents were joining the local police (later known as the [[Anbar Awakening]]) by the end of the battle, some 1,100 terrorists were killed.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|pp=180-182}}\n\nIn Fallujah, the SEAL Task Unit were also heavily involved in fighting. In one joint operation to capture an AQI leader, they entered the target building and were engaged resulting in an Iraqi Scout being killed and a SEAL severely wounded, two SEALs returned fire and entered the building, both SEALs entered different rooms, in one room the SEAL encountered three insurgents who opened fired at close range, another SEAL across the hallway was struck in the head and killed, the SEAL in the room with the insurgents killed all three.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|p=182}}\n\nIn September 2009, in a nighttime raid in Fallujah, SEALs captured [[Ahmad Hashim Abd al-Isawi]] (nicknamed the \"Butcher of Fallujah\"), a prominent al-Qaeda terrorist who was the mastermind behind the [[2004 Fallujah ambush]]. Al-Isawai made accusations of mistreatment while in custody, and testified in April 2010 at the ensuing [[court-martial|courts-martial]] against three SEALs (all of whom were acquitted).<ref name=RobinsonBook>{{cite book |title=Honor and Betrayal: The Untold Story of the Navy Seals Who Captured the \"Butcher of Fallujah\"\u2014and the Shameful Ordeal They Later Endured |isbn=978-0-30682-309-1 |year=2013 |last=Robinson |first=Patrick |authorlink=Patrick Robinson (author) |publisher=[[Perseus Book Group]] |url=https://books.google.com/?id=NUQPAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:9780306823091}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Navy SEAL not guilty of charges in Iraq |author=CNN Wire Staff |date=22 April 2010 |accessdate=28 November 2016 |website=[[CNN]] |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/04/22/navy.seal.verdict/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Navy SEAL Found Not Guilty of Assaulting a Suspected Terrorist |website=[[Fox News]] |date=6 May 2010 |url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/05/06/navy-seal-guilty-assaulting-suspected-terrorist.html |accessdate=28 November 2016 |first=Steve |last=Centanni}}</ref> Iraqi authorities later tried and executed al-Isawi by [[hanging]] at some point before November 2013.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Persecuting Our Heroes |first=Ray V. |last=Hartwell |magazine=[[The American Spectator]] |date=26 November 2013 |accessdate=7 December 2016 |url=https://spectator.org/56777_persecuting-our-heroes/}}</ref>\n\nSEALS remained employed throughout the Iraqi Campaign as Task Units or Task Elements until its close in 2011.\n\n===Operation Enduring Freedom \u2013 Philippines===\n{{Main|Operation Enduring Freedom \u2013 Philippines}}\n\nOEF-P was established in 2002 to conduct long-term partnered operations with both Philippine Army special operations and intelligence units, as well as police units to counter the threat posed by the [[Abu Sayyaf|ASG]] and [[Jemaah Islamiyah|JI]] terrorist groups.

Squadrons will normally be deployed and fall under a Joint Task Force (JTF) or a Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force (CJSOTF) as a Special Operations Task Force (SOTF).\n\nEach SEAL Team (or \"squadron\") is commanded by a Navy [[Commander (United States)|commander]] (O-5), and has eight operational SEAL platoons and a headquarters element. Operationally, the \"Team\" is divided into two to four 40-man \"task units\" (or \"troops\"). Each task unit consists of a headquarters element consisting of a task unit commander, typically a [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|lieutenant commander]] (O-4), a task unit senior enlisted (E-8), a targeting/operations officer (O-2/3) and a targeting/operations leading/chief petty officer (E-6/7). Under the HQ element are two to four SEAL platoons of 16 men (two officers and 14 enlisted SEALs, and sometimes assigned non-NSW support personnel); a company-sized combat service support (CSS) and/or combat support (CS) consisting of [[Staff (military)|staff]] N-codes (the Army and Marine Corps use S-codes); N1 Administrative support, N2 Intelligence, N3 Operations, N4 Logistics, N5 Plans and Targeting, N6 Communications, N7 Training, and N8 Air/Medical.\n\nEach 16-man platoon can be task organized for operational purposes into two eight-man squads, four four-man fire teams, or eight two-man sniper/reconnaissance teams. The size of each SEAL \"Team\", or \"squadron\", with two to four task units (containing a total of eight platoons) and support staff is approximately 300 personnel. The typical SEAL platoon has an OIC (officer in charge, usually a lieutenant (O-3), a platoon chief (E-7/E-8), and two squads commanded by a LTJG (O-2) and a squad leader (E-6). The remaining members of the squad are operators (E-4 to E-6) with their specialty skills in ordinance, communications, diving, and medical. The core leadership in the troop and platoon are the commander/OIC and the senior enlisted NCO (Senior Chief/chief).\n\nPlatoon core skills consist of: Sniper, Breacher, Communicator, Maritime/Engineering, Close Air Support, Corpsman, Point-man/Navigator, Primary Driver/Navigator (Rural/Urban/Protective Security), Heavy Weapons Operator, Sensitive Site Exploitation, Air Operations Master, Lead Climber, Lead Diver/Navigator, Interrogator, Explosive Ordnance Disposal, Technical Surveillance, and Advanced Special Operations.\n\n[[Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek]], a [[naval base]] in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]], is home to SEAL Teams 2, 4, DEVGRU,  8, 10, and 18.

He convinced the Commander Naval Operations Support Group, PACIFIC to create a small demonstration team consisting of a cadre of highly qualified freefall jumpers. Its activities were to be conducted on a \"not to interfere\" basis with other military duties and at no cost to the government, other than utilizing normally scheduled aircraft. This group eventually adopted the \"Leap Frogs\" name.<ref name=\"leap-frogs\"/>\n\nThe team was officially commissioned as the U.S. Navy Parachute Team in 1974 by the Chief of Naval Operations and assigned the mission of demonstrating Navy excellence throughout the United States. The East Coast-based \"Chuting Stars\" were disbanded in the 1980s with the \"Leap Frogs\" taking on all official parachute demonstrations within the Navy.\n\nA typical Leap Frogs performance consists of six jumpers leaping out of an aircraft at an altitude of 6,000 feet. After freefalling sometimes using smoke or streamers, the Leap Frogs fly their canopies together to build canopy-relative work formations.

As a result, the joint  Army, Marine Corps and Navy [[Scouts and Raiders|Amphibious Scout and Raider]] School was established in 1942 at [[Fort Pierce, Florida]].<ref name=\"Navy Seals History sealswcc.com\"/> The Scouts and Raiders were formed in September of that year, just nine months after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], from the [[Observer Group]], a joint U.S. Army-Marine-Navy unit. \n\n=== Scouts and Raiders ===\nRecognizing the need for a beach reconnaissance force, a select group of Army and Navy personnel assembled at [[Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek|Amphibious Training Base Little Creek]], Virginia on 15 August 1942 to begin Amphibious Scouts and Raiders (joint) training. The Scouts and Raiders mission was to identify and reconnoiter the objective beach, maintain a position on the designated beach prior to a landing, and guide the assault waves to the landing beach.<ref name=\"Navy Seal History\"/> The unit was led by U.S. Army 1st Lieutenant Lloyd Peddicord as commanding officer, and Navy Ensign John Bell as executive officer. Navy chief petty officers and sailors came from the boat pool at ATB, Solomons, Maryland and Army Raider personnel came from the 3rd and 9th Infantry Divisions. They trained at Little Creek until embarking for the North Africa campaign the following November. Operation TORCH was launched in November 1942 off the Atlantic coast of French Morocco in North Africa. <ref>https://www.navysealmuseum.org/about-navy-seals/seal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-storyseal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-story/seal-history-origins-of-naval-special-warfare-wwii</ref>\n\nThe first group included [[Phil H. Bucklew]], the \"Father of Naval Special Warfare,\" after whom the [[Naval Special Air Force Warfare Center|Naval Special Warfare Center]] building is named. Commissioned in October 1942, this group saw combat in November 1942 during [[Operation Torch]] on the North African Coast. Scouts and Raiders also supported landings in [[Sicily]], [[Salerno]], [[Anzio]], [[Normandy]], and [[southern France]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://navysealmuseum.com/about-navy-seals/seal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-story/seal-history-origins-of-naval-special-warfare-wwii/ |title=SEAL History: Origins of Naval Special Warfare-WWII |website=National Navy UDT-SEAL Museum |accessdate=24 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nA second group of Scouts and Raiders, code-named [[Special Service Unit No. 1]], was established on 7 July 1943, as a joint and [[combined operations]] force. The first mission, in September 1943, was at [[Finschhafen]] in [[Papua New Guinea]]. Later operations were at [[Gasmata]], [[Battle of Arawe|Arawe]], [[Battle of Cape Gloucester|Cape Gloucester]], and the east and south coasts of [[New Britain]], all without any loss of personnel. Conflicts arose over operational matters, and all non-Navy personnel were reassigned. The unit, renamed [[7th Amphibious Scouts]], received a new mission, to go ashore with the assault boats, buoy channels, erect markers for the incoming craft, handle casualties, take offshore soundings, clear beach obstacles and maintain voice communications linking the troops ashore, incoming boats and nearby ships. The 7th Amphibious Scouts conducted operations in the Pacific for the duration of the conflict, participating in more than 40 landings.<ref name=\"Navy Seal History\"/>\n\nThe third and final Scouts and Raiders organization operated in China. Scouts and Raiders were deployed to fight with the [[Sino-American Cooperative Organization|Sino-American Cooperative Organization, or SACO]]. To help bolster the work of SACO, Admiral [[Ernest J. King]] ordered that 120 officers and 900 men be trained for \"Amphibious Raider\" at the Scout and Raider school at [[Fort Pierce, Florida]]. They formed the core of what was envisioned as a \"guerrilla amphibious organization of Americans and Chinese operating from coastal waters, lakes and rivers employing small steamboats and sampans.\" While most Amphibious Raider forces remained at [[Camp Knox]] in Calcutta, three of the groups saw active service. They conducted a survey of the upper [[Yangtze River]] in the spring of 1945 and, disguised as [[coolies]], conducted a detailed three-month survey of the Chinese coast from [[Shanghai]] to [[Kitchioh]] Wan, near [[Hong Kong]].<ref name=\"Navy Seal History\"/>\n\n=== Naval Combat Demolition Units ===\n[[File:Naval Combat Demolition Unit 45.jpg|thumb|NCDU 45, CEC Ensign Karnowski, Chief Carpenters Mate Conrad C.

On 10 November 1942, the first combat demolition unit successfully cut cable and net barriers across the Wadi Sebou River during [[Operation Torch]] in North Africa. This enabled {{USS|Dallas|DD-199}} to traverse the water and insert [[U.S. Rangers]] who captured the Port Lyautey airdrome.\n\nIn early May 1943, a two-phase \"Naval Demolition Project\" was directed by the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] \"to meet a present and urgent requirement\". The first phase began at Amphibious Training Base (ATB) Solomons, Maryland with the establishment of Operational Naval Demolition Unit No. 1. Six officers and eighteen enlisted men reported from the [[Seabee]]'s NTC [[Camp Peary]] dynamiting and demolition school, for a four-week course. Those Seabees, led by Lieutenant Fred Wise CEC, were immediately sent to participate in the invasion of Sicily.<ref name=\"navysealmuseum.org\">{{cite web |url=https://www.navysealmuseum.org/about-navy-seals/seal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-story/seal-history-origins-of-naval-special-warfare-wwii |title=Seal History: Origins of Naval Special Warfare \u2013 WWII |website=Navy Seal Museum Archives |date= |accessdate=18 October 2017}}</ref>  At that time Lieutenant Commander [[Draper L.

Most of Kauffman's volunteers came from the navy's [[Civil Engineer Corps]] (CEC) and enlisted seabees. Training commenced with a gruelling week designed to filter out under-performing candidates.\n\nBy April 1944, a total of 34 NCDUs were deployed to England in preparation for [[Operation Overlord]], the amphibious landing at [[Normandy]]. On 6 June 1944, under heavy fire, the NCDUs at [[Omaha Beach]] managed to blow eight complete gaps and two partial gaps in the German defenses. The NCDUs suffered 31 killed and 60 wounded, a casualty rate of 52%. Meanwhile, the NCDUs at [[Utah Beach]] met less intense enemy fire. They cleared {{convert|700|yd|m|abbr=off}} of beach in two hours, another {{convert|900|yd|m|abbr=off}} by the afternoon. Casualties at Utah Beach were significantly lighter with six killed and eleven wounded. During Operation Overlord, not a single demolitioneer was lost to improper handling of explosives. In August 1944,  four NCDUs from Utah Beach plus nine others participated in the landings [[Operation Dragoon]] in southern France.  It was the last amphibious operation in the [[European Theater of Operations]].  With Europe invaded Admiral Turner requisitioned all available NCDUs from Fort Pierce for integration into the UDTs for the Pacific.\n\nThirty NCDUs<ref name=\"UDT Cold\"/>  had been sent to the Pacific prior to Normandy.

Their training started in November 1943 at Camp Pendleton, California, moved to Santa Catalina Island, California in January 1944, and finally moved to the warmer waters of The Bahamas in March 1944.

In the Mediterranean, a fleet of hired Greek wooden fishing vessels\u2014called caiques\u2014covertly supported OSS agents in Albania, Greece, and Yugoslavia. After Italy surrendered, the MU and the San Marco battalion, an elite Italian special operations naval unit, operated against the Germans. In the Far East, the MU operated in conjunction with an Operational Group to attack Japanese forces on the Arakan coast of Burma. They jointly conducted reconnaissance missions on the Japanese-held coast, sometimes penetrating several miles up enemy-controlled rivers.<ref name=\"Maritime Unit\">{{cite web |last1=United States Army Special Operations Command |title=Maritime Unit |url=https://www.soc.mil/OSS/maritime-unit.html |website=soc.mil |accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe MU developed or used several innovative devices that would later allow for the creation of a special operations combat-diver capability, first in Army Special Forces (Green Berets) and later in US Navy SEAL units. Perhaps the most important invention in the realm of special operations diving was the [[LAR5|Lambertsen Rebreathing Unit]] (LARU) invented by [[Christian Lambertsen|Dr. Christian J. Lambertsen]]. The Lambertsen unit permitted a swimmer to remain underwater for several hours and to approach targets undetected because the LARU did not emit telltale air bubbles. The LARU was later refined, adapted, and the technology used by the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, and NASA. The Army Special Forces Underwater Operations School at Key West, Florida, the home of Special Forces maritime operations, draws its roots from the Maritime Unit.<ref name=\"Maritime Unit\"/>\n\nLambertsen began his involvement with the OSS as a medical student offering the use of his technology to the secretive organization in 1942. In 1944 he would commission as an Army Officer and later joint the OSS as an Operational Swimmer. Lambertsen himself led them the OSS Maritime Unit on covert underwater missions to attach explosives to Japanese ships.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chace |first1=Dave |title=Dr. Christian Lambertsen: 70 years of influence on the military dive community |url=https://www.army.mil/article/75716/dr_christian_lambertsen_70_years_of_influence_on_the_military_dive_community |website=US Army |accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref> Dr. Christian Lambersten is remembered today as the \u2018Father of Military Underwater Operations.

Rear Admiral [[Richmond K. Turner|Kelly Turner]], commander [[V Amphibious Corps]] had ordered a review to get a grip on the problem.  VAC found that the only people having any applicable experience with the material were men in the Naval Construction Battalions.  The Admiral tasked Lt. T. C. Crist (CEC) to develop a method for blasting coral under combat conditions and putting together a team to do it.<ref name=\"UDT Cold\">The Water Is Never Cold, James Douglas O'Dell, 2000, Brassey's, 22841 Quicksilver Drive, Dulles, Va. 20166, {{ISBN|1-57488-275-9}}</ref> Lt.

The second wave of [[landing craft]] ran aground [[coral reefs|coral]] because of unexpected shallows due to the [[tide]]s. As a result, Admiral [[Richmond K. Turner|Kelly Turner]] requested the formation of nine [[underwater demolition teams]] for advance landing [[reconnaissance]] and demolition of beach obstructions. Six would be assigned to VAC in the Central Pacific while the other three would go to [[III Amphibious Corps]] in the South Pacific. UDTs 1 & 2 consisted of men Lt.

E.D. Brewster (CEC) UDT 1 and Lt. Crist (CEC) UDT 2.(Lt. Crist was replaced because Admiral Conolly wanted Line Officers with combat experience). The teams wore fatigues with life-vests and were not expected to leave their boats similar to the NCDUs. However, at Kwajalein [[Fort Pierce]] protocol was changed. Admiral Turner ordered daylight reconnaissance and CEC Ens. Lewis F. Luehrs and Seabee Chief William Atchison wore swim trunks under their fatigues anticipating they would not be able to get what the Admiral wanted by staying in the boat.

The actions of UDT 1 were immediately incorporated in the training which made it distinctly different from that at Fort Pierce. The first head of training was Seabee Lt. T.C. Crist [[Roi-Namur]]. He was in that position briefly from when UDTs 1 & 2 were decommissioned until he was made Commander of UDT 3.\n\nThe UDT uniform had transitioned from the combat fatigues of the NCDUs to trunks, [[swimfins]], [[diving mask]]s and [[Ka-bar]]s.

Beginning with a detachment of 11 personnel from UDT 3, UDT participation expanded to three teams with a combined strength of 300 men. During the \"Forgotten War\" the UDTs fought intensively, beginning to employ demolition expertise gained from WWII and use it for an offensive role. Continuing to use water as cover and concealment as well as an insertion method, the Korean Era UDTs targeted bridges, tunnels, fishing nets and other maritime and coastal targets. They also developed a close working relationship with the [[Republic of Korea]] [[Republic of Korea Navy Special Warfare Flotilla|Underwater Demolitions Unit (predecessor to the Navy Special Warfare Flotilla)]], which continues today.<ref name=\"Navy Seal History\"/>\n\nThe UDTs refined and developed their commando tactics during the Korean War, through their focused efforts on demolitions and mine disposal. The UDTs also accompanied South Korean commandos on raids in the North to demolish train tunnels. This was frowned upon by higher-ranking officials because they believed it was a non-traditional use of Naval forces. Due to the nature of the war the UDTs maintained a low operational profile. Some of the missions include transporting spies into North Korea and the destruction of North Korean fishing nets used to supply the North Korean Army.<ref name=\"Navy Seal History\"/>\n\nAs part of the Special Operations Group, or SOG, UDTs successfully conducted demolition raids on railroad tunnels and bridges along the Korean coast. The UDTs specialized in a somewhat new mission: Night coastal demolition raids against railroad tunnels and bridges. The UDT men were given the task because, in the words of UDT Lieutenant Ted Fielding, \"We were ready to do what nobody else could do, and what nobody else wanted to do.\" (Ted Fielding was awarded the Silver Star during Korea, and was later promoted to the rank of Captain).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://navysealmuseum.com/about-navy-seals/seal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-story/seal-history-underwater-demolition-teams-in-the-korean-war/ |title=SEAL History: Underwater Demolition Teams in the Korean War |website=National Navy UDT-SEAL Museum |accessdate=24 May 2014}}</ref> On 15 September 1950, UDTs supported Operation Chromite, the amphibious landing at Incheon. UDT 1 and 3 provided personnel who went in ahead of the landing craft, scouting mud flats, marking low points in the channel, clearing fouled propellers, and searching for mines. Four UDT personnel acted as wave-guides for the Marine landing. In October 1950, UDTs supported mine-clearing operations in Wonsan Harbor where frogmen would locate and mark mines for minesweepers. On 12 October 1950, two U.S. minesweepers hit mines and sank. UDTs rescued 25 sailors. The next day, William Giannotti conducted the first U.S. combat operation using an \"aqualung\" when he dove on {{USS|Pledge|AM-277|6}}. For the remainder of the war, UDTs conducted beach and river reconnaissance, infiltrated guerrillas behind the lines from sea, continued mine sweeping operations, and participated in Operation Fishnet, which devastated the North Koreans' fishing capability.<ref name=\"Navy Seal History\"/>\n\n=== Birth of Navy SEALs and the Vietnam War ===\n{{Main|Vietnam War}}\nPresident [[John F. Kennedy]], aware of the situation in Southeast Asia, recognized the need for [[unconventional warfare]] and [[special operations]] as a measure against [[guerrilla warfare]]. In a speech, to [[United States Congress|Congress]], on 25 May 1961, Kennedy spoke of his deep respect for the [[Special Forces (United States Army)|United States Army Special Forces]]. While his announcement of the government's [[Apollo program|plan to put a man on the moon]] drew most of the attention, in the same speech he announced his intention to spend over $100&nbsp;million to strengthen U.S. special operations forces and expand American capabilities in unconventional warfare. Some people erroneously credit President Kennedy with creating the Navy SEALs. His announcement was actually only a formal acknowledgement of a process that had been under way since Korea.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://navysealmuseum.com/about-navy-seals/seal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-story/genesis-of-the-u-s-navys-sea-air-land-seal-teams/ |title=Genesis of the U.S. Navy's SEa, Air, Land (SEAL) Teams |website=National Navy UDT-SEAL Museum |accessdate=24 May 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222183844/https://navysealmuseum.com/about-navy-seals/seal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-story/genesis-of-the-u-s-navys-sea-air-land-seal-teams/ |archivedate=22 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe Navy needed to determine its role within the special operations arena. In March 1961, [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Arleigh Burke]], the [[Chief of Naval Operations]], recommended the establishment of [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] and [[Counter-guerrilla warfare|counter-guerrilla]] units. These units would be able to operate from sea, air or land. This was the beginning of the Navy SEALs. All SEALs came from the Navy's [[Underwater Demolition Team]]s, who had already gained extensive experience in [[commando]] warfare in [[Korean War|Korea]]; however, the Underwater Demolition Teams were still necessary to the Navy's amphibious force.<ref name=\"Navy Seal History\" />\n\n[[File:Members of SEAL Delivery Vehicle Team Two (SDVT-2).jpg|thumb|Members of [[SDVT-2|SEAL Delivery Vehicle Team Two]] in a [[Dry Deck Shelter]] of the submerged {{USS|Philadelphia|SSN-690|6}}]]\nThe first two teams were formed in January 1962<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.mil/viewVideo.asp?id=17950 |title=Video gallery: Forged by Adversity |date=2 January 2013 |website=United States Navy |accessdate=24 May 2014}}</ref> and stationed on both US coasts: Team One at [[Naval Amphibious Base Coronado]], in San Diego, California and Team Two at [[Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek]], in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]]. Formed entirely with personnel from UDTs, the SEALs mission was to conduct counter guerilla warfare and clandestine operations in maritime and riverine environments.<ref name=\"Navy Seals History sealswcc.com\"/> Men of the newly formed SEAL Teams were trained in such unconventional areas as [[hand-to-hand combat]], [[HALO jump|high-altitude parachuting]], [[demolitions]], and foreign languages. The SEALs attended Underwater Demolition Team replacement training and they spent some time training in UDTs. Upon making it to a SEAL team, they would undergo a SEAL Basic Indoctrination (SBI) training class at Camp Kerry in the [[Cuyamaca Peak|Cuyamaca Mountains]]. After SBI training class, they would enter a [[platoon]] and conduct platoon training.\n\nAccording to founding SEAL team member [[Roy Boehm]], the SEALs' first missions were directed against communist Cuba. These consisted of deploying from submarines and carrying out beach reconnaissance in prelude to a proposed US amphibious invasion of the island. On at least one occasion Boehm and another SEAL smuggled a CIA agent ashore to take pictures of Soviet nuclear missiles being unloaded on the dockside.<ref>{{cite book |title=First SEAL |first1=Ray |last1=Boehm |first2=Charles |last2=Sasser |year=1997 |location=New York |publisher=Pocket Books |isbn=978-0-67153-625-1 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[United States Pacific Command|Pacific Command]] recognized [[Vietnam]] as a potential hot spot for unconventional forces. At the beginning of 1962, the UDTs started [[hydrographic survey]]s and along with other branches of the US Military, the [[Military Assistance Command Vietnam]] (MACV) was formed. In March 1962, SEALs were deployed to [[South Vietnam]] as advisors for the purpose of training [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] [[commando]]s in the same methods they were trained themselves.\n\nThe [[Central Intelligence Agency]] began using SEALs in [[covert operation]]s in early 1963. The SEALs were involved in the CIA sponsored [[Phoenix Program]] where it targeted key North Vietnamese Army personnel and [[Vietcong]] sympathizers for capture and assassination.\n\nThe SEALs were initially deployed in and around [[Da Nang]], training the South Vietnamese in combat diving, demolitions, and guerrilla/anti-guerrilla tactics. As the war continued, the SEALs found themselves positioned in the [[Rung Sat Special Zone]] where they were to disrupt the enemy supply and troop movements and in the [[Mekong Delta]] to fulfill [[Brown-water navy|riverine]] operations, fighting on the inland waterways.\n\n[[File:NavySeal1967Vietnam.jpg|thumb|left|SEALs on patrol in the [[Mekong Delta]]]]\nCombat with the [[National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam|Viet Cong]] was direct. Unlike the conventional warfare methods of firing artillery into a coordinate location, the SEALs operated close to their targets. Into the late 1960s, the SEALs were successful in a new style of warfare, effective in anti-guerrilla and guerrilla actions. SEALs brought a personal war to the enemy in a previously safe area. The Viet Cong referred to them as \"the men with green faces,\" due to the [[camouflage]] [[Body painting#Use in military|face paint]] the SEALs wore during combat missions.<ref>{{cite book |title=Point Man |first1=James |last1=Watson |first2=Kevin |last2=Dockery |year=1993 |location=New York |publisher=Avon Books |isbn=0-380-71986-X}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1966, a small SEAL Team One detachment arrived in Vietnam to conduct direct actions missions. Operating from [[Nh\u00e0 B\u00e8 Base]], near the R\u1eebng S\u00e1c Special Zone, this detachment signaled the beginning of a SEAL presence that would eventually include 8 SEAL platoons in country on a continuing basis.

The SEALs from Team Two started a unique deployment of SEAL team members working alone with South Vietnamese Commandos ([[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|ARVN]]). In 1967, a SEAL unit named Detachment Bravo (Det Bravo) was formed to operate these mixed US and ARVN units, which were called South Vietnamese [[Provincial Reconnaissance Unit]]s (PRUs).\n\n[[File:Presidential Unit Citation SEAL TEAM TWO 1969-1971.jpg|thumb|[[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] awarded to SEAL Team TWO for extraordinary heroism in Vietnam from July 1969 to June 1971.]]\n\nBy 1970, President [[Richard Nixon]] initiated a Plan of [[Role of United States in the Vietnam War#Vietnamization, 1969\u20131975|Vietnamization]], which would remove the US from the Vietnam War and return the responsibility of defense back to the South Vietnamese. Conventional forces were being withdrawn; the last SEAL platoon left Vietnam on 7 December 1971, the last SEAL advisor, left Vietnam in March 1973. South Vietnam fell to North Vietnamese communist forces in April 1975. The SEALs were among the highest decorated units for their size in the war, receiving by 1974 one [[Medal of Honor]], two [[Navy Cross]]es, 42 [[Silver star]]s, 402 [[Bronze Star]]s, two [[Legions of Merit]], 352 Commendation Medals, and 51 Navy Achievement Medals<ref name=\"SEAL Combat Manual\">{{Cite book |author= |title=US Navy SEAL Combat Manual |year=1974 |page=xvi |url=https://www.federaljack.com/ebooks/US-Navy-SEAL-Combat-Manual.pdf |access-date=25 January 2019 }}.</ref> Later awards would bring the total to three Medals of Honor and five Navy Crosses.

The SEALs' two primary missions were the extraction of Grenada's [[Paul Scoon|Governor-General]] and the capture of Grenada's only radio tower. Neither mission was well briefed or sufficiently supported with timely intelligence and the SEALs ran into trouble from the very beginning. On 24 October 1983, twelve operators from SEAL Team Six and four Air Force Combat Control Team members (CCT) conducted a predawn combat airborne water insertion from C130 Hercules with Zodiac inflatable rubber boats 40 kilometers north of Point Salines, Grenada. The team inserted with full combat gear in bad weather with low visibility conditions and high winds. Four SEALs drowned and were never recovered. SEALs split into two teams and proceeded to their objectives. After digging in at the Governor's mansion, the SEALs realized they had forgotten to load their [[Cryptography|cryptographic]] [[satellite phone]]. As Grenadian and Cuban troops surrounded the team, the SEALs' only radio ran out of battery power, and they used the mansion's land line telephone to call in [[AC-130]] gunship fire support. The SEALs were pinned down in the mansion overnight and were relieved and extracted by a group of Marines the following morning.\n\nThe team sent to the radio station also ran into communication problems. As soon as the SEALs reached the radio facility they found themselves unable to raise their command post. After beating back several waves of Grenadian and Cuban troops supported by [[BTR-60]] armoured personnel carriers, the SEALs decided that their position at the radio tower was untenable. They destroyed the station and fought their way to the water where they hid from patrolling enemy forces. After the enemy had given up their search the SEALs, some wounded, swam into the open sea where they were extracted several hours later after being spotted by a reconnaissance aircraft.\n\n===Iran\u2013Iraq War===\n{{Main|Operation Prime Chance}}\nDuring the closing stages of the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] the United States Navy began conducting operations in the [[Persian Gulf]] to protect US-flagged ships from attack by Iranian naval forces. A secret plan was put in place and dubbed [[Operation Prime Chance]]. Navy SEAL Teams 1 and 2 along with several Special Boat Units and EOD techs were deployed on mobile command barges and transported by helicopters from the [[160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (United States)|Army's 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment]]. Over the course of the operation SEALs conducted [[VBSS]] (Visit, Board, Search, and Seizure) missions to counter Iranian mine laying boats. The only loss of life occurred during the take down of the ''[[Iran Ajr]]<!--Not a spelling error, this is the name of a ship-->''. Evidence gathered on the ''Iran Ajr'' by the SEALs later allowed the US Navy to trace the mines that struck {{USS|Samuel B. Roberts|FFG-58}}. This chain of events led to [[Operation Praying Mantis]], the largest US Naval surface engagement since the Second World War.\n\nDuring Operation Desert Shield and Storm, Navy SEALs trained Kuwaiti Special Forces. They set up naval special operations groups in Kuwait, working with the Kuwaiti Navy in exile. Using these new diving, swimming, and combat skills, these commandos took part in combat operations such as the liberation of the capital city.\n\n===Panama===\n{{Main|United States invasion of Panama}}\n[[File:US Navy 100107-N-0000X-003 Members of Seal Team 4 pose for a group photo before Operation Just Cause.jpg|thumb|Members of SEAL Team 4 immediately before the start of Operation Just Cause]]\nThe United States Navy contributed extensive special operations assets to the invasion of Panama, codenamed [[Operation Just Cause]]. This included SEAL Teams 2 and 4, Naval Special Warfare Unit 8, and Special Boat Unit 26, all falling under Naval Special Warfare Group 2; and the separate [[Naval Special Warfare Development Group]] (DEVGRU). DEVGRU fell under Task Force Blue, while Naval Special Warfare Group 2 composed the entirety of Task Force White. Task Force White was tasked with three principal objectives: the destruction of [[Panamanian Defense Forces]] (PDF) naval assets in Balboa Harbor and the destruction of [[Manuel Noriega]]'s private jet at Paitilla Airport (collectively known as [[Operation Nifty Package]]), as well as isolating PDF forces on Flamenco Island.\n\nThe strike on Balboa Harbor by Task Unit Whiskey is notably marked in SEAL history as the first publicly acknowledged combat swimmer mission since the Second World War. Prior to the commencement of the invasion four Navy SEALs, Lt Edward S. Coughlin, EN-3 Timothy K. Eppley, ET-1 Randy L. Beausoleil, and PH-2 Chris Dye, swam underwater into the harbor on Draeger LAR-V [[rebreathers]] and attached [[C-4 (explosive)|C4 explosives]] to and destroyed Noriega's personal gunboat the ''Presidente Porras''.\n\nTask Unit Papa was tasked with the seizure of Paitilla airfield and the destruction of Noriega's plane there. Several SEALs were concerned about the nature of the mission assigned to them being that airfield seizure was usually the domain of the [[75th Ranger Regiment (United States)|Army Rangers]]. Despite these misgivings and a loss of operational surprise, the SEALs of TU Papa proceeded with their mission. Almost immediately upon landing, the 48 SEALs came under withering fire from the PDF stationed at the airfield. Although Noriega's plane was eventually destroyed, the SEALs suffered four dead and thirteen wounded. Killed were Lt. John Connors, Chief Petty Officer [[Donald L. McFaul|Donald McFaul]], Torpedoman's Mate 2nd Class Issac Rodriguez, and Boatswain's Mate 1st Class Chris Tilghman.\n\n===Persian Gulf War===\n{{main|Gulf War}}\nIn August 1990, SEALs were the first western forces to deploy to the [[Persian Gulf]] as part of [[Gulf War#Operation Desert Shield|Operation Desert Shield]]. They infiltrated the capital city of [[Kuwait]] within hours of the invasion and gathered intelligence and developed plans to rescue US embassy staff should they become hostages. SEALs were also the first to capture Iraqi Prisoners of War when they assaulted nine Kuwaiti Oil platforms on 19 January 1991. On 23 February 1991, a seven-man SEAL team launched a mission to trick the Iraqi military into thinking an amphibious assault on Kuwait by coalition forces was imminent by setting off explosives and placing marking buoys 500 meters off the Kuwaiti coast. The mission was a success and Iraqi forces were diverted east away from the true coalition offensive.{{sfnp|Cawthorne|2008}} The SEALs were first into Kuwait City in their [[Desert Patrol Vehicle]]s when it was recaptured.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|p=14}}\n\n===Somalia Intervention===\nOn 6 December 1992, as part of [[Unified Task Force|Operation Restore Hope]], U.S. Navy SEALs and Special Boat crewmen from Naval Special Warfare Task Unit TRIPOLI began a three-day operation carrying out reconnaissance operations in the vicinity of [[Mogadishu]] airport and harbor; ahead of UNITAFs deployment to the country.

SEAL Teams 3 and 8 also began rotating into Oman from the United States and staging on the island of [[Masirah Island|Masirah]] for operations in Afghanistan. One of the SEALs' immediate concerns was their lack of suitable vehicles to conduct [[special reconnaissance]] (SR) missions in the rough, landlocked terrain of Afghanistan. After borrowing and retrofitting Humvees from the [[75th Ranger Regiment|Army Rangers]] also staging on Masirah, the SEALs inserted into Afghanistan to conduct the SR of what would become [[Camp Rhino]], as part of [[Operation Enduring Freedom#Operation Enduring Freedom \u2013 Afghanistan (OEF-A)|Operation Enduring Freedom \u2013 Afghanistan]] (OEF-A). These early stages of OEF were commanded by a fellow SEAL, [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Albert Calland]].\n\n[[File:US Navy SEALs at Zhawar Kili cave entrance.jpg|thumb|Task Force K-Bar SEALs at one of the entrances to the [[Zhawar Kili]] cave complex]]\nAs part of the CJSOTF (Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force) under the command of General [[Tommy Franks]] at [[CENTCOM]] SEALs from DEVGRU were part of Task Force Sword, which was established in early October 2001. It was a [[Black operation|black]] SOF (Special Operations Forces) unit under direct command of [[JSOC]]. It was a so-called hunter-killer force whose primary objective was of capturing or killing senior leadership and HVT within both al-Qaeda and the Taliban. Sword was initially structured around a two-squadron component of operators from Delta Force (Task Force Green) and DEVGRU (Task Force Blue) supported by a Ranger protection force teams (Task Force Red) and ISA signals intercept and surveillance operators (Task Force Orange) and the 160th SOAR (Task Force Brown). [[Task Force K-Bar]] was established on 10 October 2001, it was formed around a Naval Special Warfare Group consisting of SEALs from SEAL Teams 2, 3 and 8 and Green Berets from 1st Battalion, [[3rd Special Forces Group (United States)|3rd SFG]]; the task force was led by SEAL Captain [[Robert Harward]].\n\nThe task force's principal task was to conduct SR and [[Site Exploitation|SSE]] missions in the south of the country. Other Coalition SOF-particularly [[Kommando Spezialkr\u00e4fte|KSK]], [[Joint Task Force 2|JTF2]] and [[New Zealand Special Air Service]] were assigned to the task force. As part of the JIATF-CT (Joint Interagency Task Force-Counterterrorism) \u2013 intelligence integration and fusion activity manned by personnel from all Operation Enduring Freedom \u2013 Afghanistan (OEF-A) participating units- SEALs from DEVGRU were part of Task Force Bowie, they were embedded in the task force in AFOs (Advanced Force Operations). The AFOs were 45-man reconnaissances units made up of a Delta Force recce specialists augmented by selected SEALs from [[DEVGRU]] and supported by [[Intelligence Support Activity|ISA]]'s technical experts. The AFOs had been raised to support TF Sword and were tasked with intelligence preparation of the battlefield, working closely with the CIA and reported directly to Task Force Sword. The AFOs conducted covert reconnaissance \u2013 sending small 2 or 3 man teams into al-Qaeda 'Backyard' along the border with Pakistan, the AFO operators would deploy observation posts to watch and report enemy movements and numbers as well as environmental reconnaissance; much of the work was done on foot or [[All-terrain vehicle|ATVs]].{{sfnp|Neville|2015|pp=25-31}}\n\nSEALs were present at the [[Battle of Qala-i-Jangi]] in November 2001 alongside their counterparts from the British [[Special Boat Service|SBS]]. Chief Petty Officer [[Stephen Bass]] was awarded the [[Navy Cross]] for his actions during the battle.\n\nBefore the US Marines landed at [[Camp Rhino]] in November 2001, a SEAL recce team from [[SEAL Team 8]] conducted reconnaissance of the area, they were mistakenly engaged by orbiting [[Bell AH-1 SuperCobra|AH-1W attack helicopters]], but the SEALs managed to get a message through to the Marines before they suffered casualties.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|p=44}} The SR mission in the region of Camp Rhino lasted for four days, after which two [[United States Air Force Combat Control Team]]s made a nighttime [[HALO jump]] to assist the SEALs in guiding in [[U.S. Marine Corps|Marines]] from the [[15th Marine Expeditionary Unit]] who seized control of the area and established a [[Forward operating base]].\n\n====Post-invasion====\n[[File:US Navy SEALs in Khawar Kili.jpg|thumb|left|Task Force K-Bar SEALs searching munitions found in the [[Zhawar Kili]] cave complex]]\nIn January 2002, following the [[Battle of Tora Bora]], another series of caves was discovered in [[Zhawar Kili]], just south of [[Tora Bora]]; airstrikes hit the sites before SOF teams were inserted into the area. A SEAL platoon from SEAL Team 3, including several of their Desert Patrol Vehicles, accompanied by a German KSK element, a Norwegian SOF team and [[JTF2]] reconnaissance teams spent some nine days conducting extensive SSE, clearing an estimated 70 caves and 60 structures in the area, recovering a huge amount of both intelligence and munitions, but they didn't encounter any al-Qaeda fighters.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|pp=49-50 & 77}} Subsequent SEAL operations during the invasion of Afghanistan were conducted within Task Force K-Bar, a joint special operations unit of [[United States Army Special Forces|Army Special Forces]], [[Air Force Special Operations Command|United States Air Force Special Tactics Teams]], and special operations forces from Norway, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and Denmark. Task Force K-Bar conducted combat operations in the massive cave complexes near the city of [[Kandahar]] and surrounding territory, the town of Prata Ghar and hundreds of miles of rough terrain in southern and eastern Afghanistan. Over the course of six months Task Force K-Bar killed or captured over 200 Taliban and al Qaeda fighters, and destroyed tens of thousands of pounds of weapons and ordnance.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nIn February 2002, while at Camp Rhino, the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] passed on intelligence from a [[Predator drone]] operating in the [[Paktia]] province that [[Taliban]] Mullah [[Khirullah Said Wali Khairkhwa]] was spotted leaving a building by vehicle convoy.

Their role was to conduct heliborne direct action raids, particularly against HVTs. The Naval Special Operations Task Group was assigned to Operation Iraqi Freedom, and was built around a core of SEAL Teams 8 and 10, Polish [[GROM]], [[Royal Marines]] from [[40 Commando|40]] and [[42 Commando]] under the command of [[3 Commando Brigade]] and attached [[United States Army Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Command|US Psy Ops and civil affairs]] teams. The Naval Task Group was principally tasked with the capture of the port of [[Umm Qasr]], Iraq's only deep-water port; the oil pipeline facilities of the [[Al-Faw Peninsula]]; and the two off-shore platforms the pipelines fed. Once these initial target sets were secured, the Task Group would support conventional forces in the south, conducting reconnaissance and raiding activities. Aviation support was provided by both Marine air of the 15th MEU and [[20th Special Operations Squadron]].{{sfnp|Neville|2015|p=96}}\n\nSeveral days before the beginning of the invasion, two SDV teams were launched from [[Mark V Special Operations Craft]] in the Persian Gulf. Their objectives were the [[Hydrographic survey|hydrographic reconnaissance]] of the [[KAAOT|Al Basrah (MABOT) and Khawr Al Amaya (KAAOT) Oil Terminals]]. After swimming under the terminals and securing their [[SEAL Delivery Vehicle|Mark 8 mod 1s]], the SDV SEALs spent several hours taking pictures and surveying Iraqi activity on both platforms before returning to their boats.{{sfnp|Cawthorne|2008}} On 20 March 2003, SEALs from SEAL Team 8 and 10 (31 SEALs, 2 [[United States Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal|Navy EOD]] a USAF combat controller and several Iraqi interpreters) moved to seize the MABOT oil terminal whilst GROM operators assaulted the KAAOT Oil Terminals. The terminals were quickly seized with no casualties, and explosives which were found on the terminals were made safe by GROM operators.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|p=123}}\n\nThe shore-based pumping stations (known as MMS-Monitoring and Meter Stations) and their pipelines on the Al-Faw Peninsula were [[Battle of Al Faw (2003)|seized by]] 12 SEALS from SEAL Team 3, who were mounted in DPVs. They took off from Kuwait and were inserted under Iraqi anti-aircraft fire by MH-53 helicopters. The target area was 'softened up' by [[Joint Direct Attack Munition|JDAM]] bombs dropped from [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52s]] on Iraqi bunkers, trenches and dugouts around the oil facilities. After a brief firefight in which the SEALs killed 1 Iraqi soldier and captured 13, the SEALs secured the MMS and the pipelines, and were relieved by Royal Marines from 40 Commando. The SEALs advised the Marines, helping coordinate [[Lockheed AC-130|AC-130 Spectres]] fire support onto Iraqi forces. The other shore-based pumping station at Umm Qasr was secured by SEALs and Royal Marines; before they landed, AC-130 Spectres and [[Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II|A-10As]] engaged a nearby [[Surface-to-air missile|SAM]] installation and a responding Iraqi mechanised unit. The SEALs secured the facility itself whilst the Royal Marines cleared Iraqi bunkers, killing several Iraqi soldiers.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|pp=123-126}}{{sfnp|Rossiter|2009|pp=149, 153 & 158-162}}{{sfnp|Kyle|2013}}\n\nOther Naval Task Group operations included elements of three SEAL platoons in GMV trucks and DPVs seizing the al Zubayr MMS, whilst [[I Marine Expeditionary Force|I MEF]] attacked the Rumaylah Oil Fields north of al-Faw. SEALs and [[Special warfare combatant-craft crewmen|Special Boat teams]] helped secure the Khawr Abd Allah and Khawr Az Zubyar waterways, which enabled humanitarian supplies to be delivered to the port of Umm Qasr. SEALs from the unit that secured the al-Faw MMS also conducted reconnaissance on the Shat Al Arab waterway, that was later secured by British forces. SEALs were also involved in various VBSS missions with British and Australian forces to seize Iraqi craft carrying seaborne mines.{{sfnp|Cawthorne|2008}}{{sfnp|Kyle|2013}}{{sfnp|Neville|2015|pp=126-127}}\n\nCoalition military planners were concerned that retreating Iraqi forces would destroy the Mukatayin hydroelectric dam, located 57 miles northeast of Baghdad, in an attempt to slow advancing US troops. In addition to restricting the manoeuvre of Coalition forces, the destruction of the dam would deny critical power needs to the surrounding area, as well as cause massive flooding and loss of Iraqi civilian life. A mixed team of SEALs from SEAL Team 5 and Polish GROM was called in to seize the dam. This force was flown several hours by six US Air Force [[Sikorsky MH-53|MH-53J Pave Lows]]; the force consisted of 20 SEALs (with an extra six SEAL snipers in one helicopter carrying the SEAL command and control element) and two EOD operators along with 35 GROM operators to the dam. The SEALs employed DPVs into blocking positions to defend against counter-attack and roving bands of Iranian bandits that had been crossing the border and raiding Iraqi towns. As in Al Faw, the SEALs found their DPVs (the SEAL unit at the al-Faw MMS lost all but two DPVs when they were bogged down in the oily mud) to be ineffective and this marked the last time they would employ them in Iraq. The SEALs and GROM on foot fast-roped out of their helicopters and immediately stormed the dam. The minimal{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=September 2017}} Iraqi troops guarding the dam surrendered without a fight, and with the exception of a GROM [[soldier]] who broke an ankle during the insertion, no casualties were sustained in the operation. After several hours of searching the dam for remaining hostile forces or any explosives, the SEALs secured the dam and held it for five days until they were relieved by advancing elements of the US Army.{{sfnp|Kyle|2013}}{{sfnp|Neville|2015|p=127}}{{sfnp|Rossiter|2009|p=161}}<ref>{{cite book |title=No Easy Day: The Autobiography of a Navy Seal: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden |first=Mark |last=Owen |year=2012 |location=New York |publisher=Dutton Books |page=[https://archive.org/details/noeasyday00mark/page/49 49] |isbn=978-0-52595-372-2 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Basra (2003)|Battle of Basra]], SEALs along with the [[Brigade Patrol Troop|Brigade Reconnaissance Force]] and [[539 Assault Squadron RM]] attempted a waterborne approach to [[Basra]] via the Shatt al-Arab waterway but were intercepted by [[Islamic Republic of Iran Navy|Iranian Revolutionary Guard]] patrol craft and did not want to engage them so they withdrew. On 6 April 2003, after relocating further up the waterway they successfully infiltrated via the waterway, using SEAL UAVs they called in \"show-of-force\" and an airstrike by a USMC harrier on Iraqi troops, the SEALs then headed to \"[[Ali Hassan al-Majid|Chemical Ali]]'s\" house with SSE teams to find traces of chemical weapons.{{sfnp|Rossiter|2009|pp=325\u2013328}} SEALs carried out missions around [[Nasiriyah]], carrying out reconnaissance on surrounding villages and engaging enemy strong points bypassed by the US Marine advance.

In September 2004, a SEAL sniper element was tasked with establishing an overwatch and surveillance position overlooking [[Haifa Street]], they were inserted by [[M2 Bradley|Bradley IFVs]] from a unit of the [[9th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|9th Cavalry Regiment]], however they were spotted and engaged by insurgents. The SEALs notified the Bradleys, they drove back, fired on the insurgents and set up a cordon for the SEALs to be extracted, one Bradley was destroyed by a car bomb, there were no casualties and the SEALs were extracted.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|pp=178-179}}\n\nIn the interim between the First Battle of Fallujah and [[Second Battle of Fallujah]], insurgents in [[Fallujah]] knew that the coalition assault was inevitable and under the guidance of the influx of foreign fighters, began to build defensive networks throughout the city-ranging from fortified buildings, trench lines, [[berm]]s, strategically placed [[car bomb]]s and [[Improvised explosive device|IEDs]]. In preparations for the second battle, SEALs conducted reconnaissance near the berms and tested out reports that the insurgents were equipped with night-vision equipment, they proved this by throwing an infra-red chemical light into the street which drew small arms fire. SEALs along with the [[5th Special Forces Group (United States)|5th SFG]], [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Marine Force Recon]] and [[MCSOCOM Detachment One|Det One]] and other JSOC elements were heavily involved in shaping operations prior to the 7 November [[D-Day (military term)|D-DAY]] when coalition forces entered the city. The SOF shaping included sophisticated feints to mislead the insurgents as to the direction of the final assault, close target reconnaissance and direct-action missions where a logistics node or IED factory was targeted. When the offensive on the insurgents in the city began, many of the US Marine companies had SEAL sniper teams attached to them, mainly from SEAL Teams 3, 5 and 10.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|pp=175-178}}\n\nFrom 2005, SEALs were heavily committed to western Iraq in [[Al Anbar Governorate]], [[Tanzim Qaidat al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Rafidayn|AQI]] terrorists who escaped Fallujah had relocated to [[Ramadi]]. A SEAL Task Unit was co-located with the Marines at [[Al Asad Airbase]] and sent elements to Ramadi and [[Habbaniyah]], the SEALs were initially tasked with target development for the Marines and providing sniper overwatch for their patrols. The SEALs were already training an Iraqi Army unit in Habbaniyah, although [[Foreign internal defense|FID]] was their main focus until later that year. A SEAL Task Unit generally comprised two individual SEAL Platoons: each Platoon was made up of seven-man squad elements commanded by a [[junior officer]], three of these Task Units (although a fourth was often added) along with a Special Boat Team detachment and a Headquarters Team (including integral intelligence, targeting and EOD personnel) made up a Naval Special Warfare Squadron. According to [[Dick Couch]], the SEALs began FID with two Iraqi units-the Army Scouts who conducted conventional reconnaissance missions, and the SMP (Special Missions Platoon), a locally formed unit that would later fight alongside the SEALs. Despite several challenges, the SEALs were soon conducted operations with partnered units, particularly in Special Reconnaissance, focusing on the surveillance aspect, whilst conventional US Army or Marines would conduct raids and arrests.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|pp=179-180}} The typical loadout of the SEALs in Ramadi included the M4 carbine, optimised for close quarter battle with a 10-inch barrel equipped with a 6-inch sound suppressor, Surefire flashlight and EOTech sight, short barrel and foregrip and seven magazines.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://corpidelite.net/afm/2017/05/a-navy-seal-loadout-in-ramadi/ |title=A Navy SEAL loadout in Ramadi |website=Corpi d'\u00e9lite.net |language=en-US |access-date=1 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nAs the SEALs were beginning to make headway in Ramadi, AQI was starting to infiltrate the area by targeting local [[Sheikh]]s and convincing them to allow jihadists to marry into local tribes, thus cementing their powerbase and Sheikhs that resisted these advances were met with typical AQI brutality. Al-Qaeda's efforts to install a [[Sharia]]-style shadow government in Ramadi led to AQI's downfall-when in the first half of 2006, in the run-up to the [[Battle of Ramadi (2006)|Second Battle of Ramadi]] SEALs, increasingly partnered with conventional forces of the [[1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division]] which was planning the offensive. SEALs along with the Scouts and SMP, would conduct reconnaissance, surveillance and sniper overwatch tasks; with their own targeting cell, they also began conducting raids on local insurgent leaders. The 1st BCT began the concerted offensive to clear Ramadi of AQI fighters; on 29 September 2006, whilst at a rooftop overwatch position, Petty Officer [[Michael A. Monsoor]] died after leaping upon an enemy grenade during a rooftop firefight, two SEALs on the roof were badly wounded from the grenade fragments and their local Iraqi Scouts ran back into the cover of the building, a fourth SEAL (only lightly wounded), managed to radio his colleagues and get the Scouts to return fire. A SEAL element in a second overwatch position immediately ran through heavy fire to reach Monsoor (whom later died from his wounds in the back of a Bradley IFV) and the wounded SEALs, Monsoor was later awarded the Medal of Honor and the Silver Star. The advances by conventional forces and the SEALs in Ramadi, combined with the brutal tactics of AQI, helped to increase recruitment in a local police initiative-the programme was designed to bring the local Sheikhs' militias into the Iraqi Security Forces.

He convinced the Commander Naval Operations Support Group, PACIFIC to create a small demonstration team consisting of a cadre of highly qualified freefall jumpers. Its activities were to be conducted on a \"not to interfere\" basis with other military duties and at no cost to the government, other than utilizing normally scheduled aircraft. This group eventually adopted the \"Leap Frogs\" name.<ref name=\"leap-frogs\"/>\n\nThe team was officially commissioned as the U.S. Navy Parachute Team in 1974 by the Chief of Naval Operations and assigned the mission of demonstrating Navy excellence throughout the United States. The East Coast-based \"Chuting Stars\" were disbanded in the 1980s with the \"Leap Frogs\" taking on all official parachute demonstrations within the Navy.\n\nA typical Leap Frogs performance consists of six jumpers leaping out of an aircraft at an altitude of 6,000 feet. After freefalling sometimes using smoke or streamers, the Leap Frogs fly their canopies together to build canopy-relative work formations. After performances, the Leap Frogs make themselves available to the public to answer questions about the Navy and the Naval Special Warfare community, as well as to sign autographs.\n\n==Influence on foreign units==\n[[File:GROM with Navy SEALs 01.jpg|thumb|right|US Navy SEALs and [[JW GROM|GROM]]\u2014Polish naval warfare team members\u2014practicing boarding skills near Gdansk, Poland, 2009]]\nFrom its predecessors, the [[Underwater Demolition Teams]], to its current form, the SEALs have influenced the training and formation of several foreign units.
