In [[Michigan]], it is a [[Michigan State Trunkline Highway System|state trunkline highway]] that enters the state south of [[Coldwater, Michigan|Coldwater]] and passes the cities of [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]] and [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]] in the [[Lower Peninsula]]. A north\u2013south freeway from the Indiana\u2013Michigan border to the Lansing area, it changes direction to east\u2013west after [[concurrency (road)|running concurrently]] with [[Interstate 96|I-96]]. The freeway continues to Port Huron before terminating in the middle of the twin-span [[Blue Water Bridge]] while running concurrently with [[Interstate 94 in Michigan|I-94]] at the border. There are four related [[Business routes of Interstate 69 in Michigan|business loop]]s for I-69 in the state, connecting the freeway to adjacent cities.\n\nPredecessors to I-69 include the first [[M-29 (Michigan highway)|M-29]], [[U.S. Route 27 in Michigan|US Highway&nbsp;27]] (US&nbsp;27), [[M-78 (Michigan highway)|M-78]] and [[M-21 (Michigan highway)|M-21]]. The freeway was not included on the original Interstate Highway System planning maps in the mid-1950s, but it was added in 1958 along a shorter route. Michigan built segments of freeway for the future Interstate in the 1960s, and the state was granted additional Interstate mileage in 1968 to extend I-69 north and east to Flint. Later extensions in 1973 and 1987 resulted in the modern highway. The first freeway segment designated as I-69 in Michigan opened in 1967, and the last was completed in 1992, finishing Michigan's Interstate System. US&nbsp;27 previously ran concurrently with I-69 from the Indiana\u2013Michigan state line north to the Lansing area, but this designation was removed in 2002.\n\n==Route description==\nThe entirety of I-69 is listed on the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]],<ref name=NHS-MI>{{cite map |title = National Highway System, Michigan |date = April 23, 2006 |location = Lansing |publisher = Michigan Department of Transportation |url = http://www.michigan.gov/documents/MDOT_NHS_Statewide_150626_7.pdf |format = PDF |author = Michigan Department of Transportation |scale = Scale not given |access-date = October 7, 2008 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/6AqxSurw0?url=http://www.michigan.gov/documents/MDOT_NHS_Statewide_150626_7.pdf |archive-date = September 21, 2012 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> which is a network of roadways important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.<ref name=NHS>{{cite web |first1 = Stefan |last1 = Natzke |first2 = Mike |last2 = Neathery |first3 = Kevin |last3 = Adderly |lastauthoramp = yes |url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/national_highway_system/ |title = What is the National Highway System? |work = National Highway System |publisher = [[Federal Highway Administration]] |date = June 20, 2012 |access-date = July 1, 2012 }}</ref> The freeway carries 91,100&nbsp;vehicles [[average annual daily traffic|on average each day]] between [[Interstate 475 (Michigan)|I-475]] and [[M-54 (Michigan highway)|M-54]] in [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]] and 14,085&nbsp;vehicles between [[M-53 (Michigan highway)|M-53]] and Capac Road near the [[Lapeer County, Michigan|Lapeer]]\u2013[[St. Clair County, Michigan|St. Clair]] county line, the highest and lowest traffic counts in 2012, respectively.<ref name=TMIS>{{cite web |author = Bureau of Transportation Planning |url = http://mdotnetpublic.state.mi.us/tmispublic/ |title = Traffic Monitoring Information System |publisher = Michigan Department of Transportation |year = 2012 |access-date = August 18, 2013 }}</ref> I-69 carries the [[Lake Huron Circle Tour]] in the [[Port Huron, Michigan|Port Huron]] area and the I-69 Recreational Heritage Route from the Indiana state line north to the [[Calhoun County, Michigan|Calhoun]]\u2013[[Eaton County, Michigan|Eaton]] county line.<ref name=MDOT13/> I-69 is mostly a four-lane freeway in the state of Michigan, with exceptions in the Lansing and Flint metro areas where it is six lanes and in Port Huron where it is three lanes westbound and three lanes eastbound until eastbound traffic splits into six lanes of local traffic to Port Huron and two lanes to the [[Blue Water Bridge]].\n\n===Northward to Lansing===\n[[File:I-69 exit 70 MI.jpg|thumb|left|Approaching exit&nbsp;70|alt=Photograph]]\nI-69 in Michigan begins at the Indiana state line southeast of [[Kinderhook, Michigan|Kinderhook]] and just north of an interchange with the [[Indiana Toll Road]], which carries [[Interstate 80 in Indiana|I-80]] and [[Interstate 90 in Indiana|I-90]].

Near [[Olivet, Michigan|Olivet]], I-69 begins to turn in a northeasterly direction and curves around the north side of town. On the south side of [[Charlotte, Michigan|Charlotte]], I-69 turns northward, traversing an area to the east of downtown and crossing the former routing of US&nbsp;27, which is now part of the [[Interstate 69 Business (Charlotte, Michigan)|business loop for the city]]. Farther north, the freeway has a junction with [[M-50 (Michigan highway)|M-50]], a bridge over the Battle Creek River, and an interchange with the northern end of the business loop next to [[Fitch H. Beach Airport]]. North of the airport, I-69 turns northeasterly again and parallels Lansing Road, the former route of US&nbsp;27/M-78. The freeway meets the southern end of [[M-100 (Michigan highway)|M-100]] near [[Potterville, Michigan|Potterville]] and continues into the Lansing\u2013[[East Lansing, Michigan|East Lansing]] metropolitan area. Southwest of the state's capital city, I-69 crosses over Lansing Road near [[Lansing Delta Township Assembly]], a factory for [[General Motors]]; northeast of the complex, I-69 merges into I-96.<!--<ref name=MDOT13/><ref name=google/> The two freeways form the only [[palindrome|palindromic]] pairing in the entire [[Interstate Highway System]].--> The combined I-96/I-69 runs northward through the suburban edges of the Lansing area, intersecting the western ends of [[Interstate 496|I-496]] and the [[Interstate 69 Business (Lansing, Michigan)|BL I-69 for Lansing]].

In [[Michigan]], it is a [[Michigan State Trunkline Highway System|state trunkline highway]] that enters the state south of [[Coldwater, Michigan|Coldwater]] and passes the cities of [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]] and [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]] in the [[Lower Peninsula]]. A north\u2013south freeway from the Indiana\u2013Michigan border to the Lansing area, it changes direction to east\u2013west after [[concurrency (road)|running concurrently]] with [[Interstate 96|I-96]]. The freeway continues to Port Huron before terminating in the middle of the twin-span [[Blue Water Bridge]] while running concurrently with [[Interstate 94 in Michigan|I-94]] at the border. There are four related [[Business routes of Interstate 69 in Michigan|business loop]]s for I-69 in the state, connecting the freeway to adjacent cities.\n\nPredecessors to I-69 include the first [[M-29 (Michigan highway)|M-29]], [[U.S. Route 27 in Michigan|US Highway&nbsp;27]] (US&nbsp;27), [[M-78 (Michigan highway)|M-78]] and [[M-21 (Michigan highway)|M-21]]. The freeway was not included on the original Interstate Highway System planning maps in the mid-1950s, but it was added in 1958 along a shorter route. Michigan built segments of freeway for the future Interstate in the 1960s, and the state was granted additional Interstate mileage in 1968 to extend I-69 north and east to Flint. Later extensions in 1973 and 1987 resulted in the modern highway. The first freeway segment designated as I-69 in Michigan opened in 1967, and the last was completed in 1992, finishing Michigan's Interstate System. US&nbsp;27 previously ran concurrently with I-69 from the Indiana\u2013Michigan state line north to the Lansing area, but this designation was removed in 2002.\n\n==Route description==\nThe entirety of I-69 is listed on the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]],<ref name=NHS-MI>{{cite map |title = National Highway System, Michigan |date = April 23, 2006 |location = Lansing |publisher = Michigan Department of Transportation |url = http://www.michigan.gov/documents/MDOT_NHS_Statewide_150626_7.pdf |format = PDF |author = Michigan Department of Transportation |scale = Scale not given |access-date = October 7, 2008 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/6AqxSurw0?url=http://www.michigan.gov/documents/MDOT_NHS_Statewide_150626_7.pdf |archive-date = September 21, 2012 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> which is a network of roadways important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.<ref name=NHS>{{cite web |first1 = Stefan |last1 = Natzke |first2 = Mike |last2 = Neathery |first3 = Kevin |last3 = Adderly |lastauthoramp = yes |url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/national_highway_system/ |title = What is the National Highway System? |work = National Highway System |publisher = [[Federal Highway Administration]] |date = June 20, 2012 |access-date = July 1, 2012 }}</ref> The freeway carries 91,100&nbsp;vehicles [[average annual daily traffic|on average each day]] between [[Interstate 475 (Michigan)|I-475]] and [[M-54 (Michigan highway)|M-54]] in [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]] and 14,085&nbsp;vehicles between [[M-53 (Michigan highway)|M-53]] and Capac Road near the [[Lapeer County, Michigan|Lapeer]]\u2013[[St. Clair County, Michigan|St. Clair]] county line, the highest and lowest traffic counts in 2012, respectively.<ref name=TMIS>{{cite web |author = Bureau of Transportation Planning |url = http://mdotnetpublic.state.mi.us/tmispublic/ |title = Traffic Monitoring Information System |publisher = Michigan Department of Transportation |year = 2012 |access-date = August 18, 2013 }}</ref> I-69 carries the [[Lake Huron Circle Tour]] in the [[Port Huron, Michigan|Port Huron]] area and the I-69 Recreational Heritage Route from the Indiana state line north to the [[Calhoun County, Michigan|Calhoun]]\u2013[[Eaton County, Michigan|Eaton]] county line.<ref name=MDOT13/> I-69 is mostly a four-lane freeway in the state of Michigan, with exceptions in the Lansing and Flint metro areas where it is six lanes and in Port Huron where it is three lanes westbound and three lanes eastbound until eastbound traffic splits into six lanes of local traffic to Port Huron and two lanes to the [[Blue Water Bridge]].\n\n===Northward to Lansing===\n[[File:I-69 exit 70 MI.jpg|thumb|left|Approaching exit&nbsp;70|alt=Photograph]]\nI-69 in Michigan begins at the Indiana state line southeast of [[Kinderhook, Michigan|Kinderhook]] and just north of an interchange with the [[Indiana Toll Road]], which carries [[Interstate 80 in Indiana|I-80]] and [[Interstate 90 in Indiana|I-90]].

The latter is referred to in British nationality law as the \"[[Republic of Ireland]]\" and was previously referred to as \"Eire\" {{sic}}<ref group=\"note\">A misspelling of ''[[\u00c9ire]]''. According to the 1937 [[Constitution of Ireland]], (Article 4) \"the [[Names of the Irish state|name]] of the State is \u00c9ire, or, in the English language, Ireland\" .</ref> between 1937 and 1949 and as the [[Irish Free State]] between 1922 and 1937. (This article does not discuss [[Irish nationality law]]).\n\n== British subjects ==\n\nWhen the [[Irish Free State]] left the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] in 1922, the existing status of \"British subject\" was, from the point of view of British nationality law, left unaffected. Broadly speaking, this was because, as a [[dominion]] within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]], the Irish Free State continued to form part of \"His Majesty's dominions\".\n\nThis British theory of \"British subject\" nationality was not fully shared by the Irish government and as early as the 1920s was discussed in Ireland in the following terms:\n\n{{quote|The meaning of 'citizenship' [in the [[Constitution of the Irish Free State]], which was approved by the British government] is defined only to the extent of saying that the citizen shall 'within the limits of the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State enjoy the privileges and be subject to the obligations of such citizenship'. There appears to be here a suggestion that the status of citizen of the Irish Free State carries no privileges or obligations outside the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State: that the Irish Free State citizen when he goes to France has no 'privileges or obligations' as such. This may not have been intended at all: on the other hand it may have been deliberately inserted in pursuance of a British theory that the citizen of any Dominion, once he gets outside his Dominion, must rely for support on his 'Imperial' status as a 'British Subject'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.difp.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=1355|title=Extract from a memorandum on nationality and citizenship  | work=Documents on Irish Foreign Policy| publisher=[[Royal Irish Academy]], (Irish) Department of Foreign Affairs, [[National Archives of Ireland]] }}</ref>}}\n\n== British subjects with local Irish nationality ==\n\nAccording to Article 3 of the 1922 [[Constitution of the Irish Free State]]\n\n{{quotation|Every person, without distinction of sex, domiciled in the area of the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State (''Saorst\u00e1t Eireann'') at the time of the coming into operation of this Constitution who was born in Ireland or either of whose parents was born in Ireland or who has been ordinarily resident in the area of the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State (Saorst\u00e1t Eireann) for not less than seven years, is a citizen of the Irish Free State (Saorst\u00e1t Eireann) and shall within the limits of the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State (Saorst\u00e1t Eireann) enjoy the privileges and be subject to the obligations of such citizenship [...].}}\n\nThe same Article also stated that \"the conditions governing the future acquisition and termination of citizenship in the Irish Free State\" were to be \"determined by law\". However, no such law was passed until 1935.\n\nFrom the British perspective, Free State citizenship was only enjoyed by its holders \"within the limits of the [Free State's] jurisdiction\". There were some remarkable manifestations of the British perspective in this matter, such as the ''Parkes'' case. In ''Murray v. Parkes'' (1942), the King's Bench Divisional Court found that [[Roscommon]]-born Michael Murray, then aged 33 and living in Leicester, was a [[British subject]] and therefore legitimately subject to conscription into the British Army. ''The Irish Times'' reported on 2 April 1942 that the Court held that<ref>''The Irish Times'', 2 April 1942; See also https://www.jstor.org/pss/1089976</ref>\n\n{{quotation| Murray was a British subject and nothing had deprived him of that status. The legislation that made him a citizen of the Irish Free State did no more than confer on him a national character as an Irish citizen within the wider British nationality. His status was that of a British subject...}}\nThe position has been commented on in the following terms:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://borderireland.info/pubs/BI-01169.pdf |title=BORDERS AND EMPLOYMENT: OPPORTUNITIES AND BARRIERS |first=Elizabeth |last=Meehan |publisher=Institute of Governance, [[Queens University Belfast]] |access-date=29 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005211601/http://borderireland.info/pubs/BI-01169.pdf |archive-date=5 October 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n{{quotation|Thus, the Constitution reflected the twin intentions of the Treaty which, on the one hand, stipulated that the privileges and obligations of Irish citizenship were to be within the limits of the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State\u2019 (reflecting the existence of Northern Ireland and partition) and, on the other, linked them to an external power through the Oath of Allegiance to the British Crown and common citizenship of the Commonwealth. Though unique in the Commonwealth of the day, Irish citizenship, therefore, was not an autonomous status. It was not until the 1930s that 'an Irish citizenship for international purposes was established', independently of a Treaty and Constitution enacted as British statutes. Under the power contemplated in Article 3 of the 1922 Constitution, the Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1935 repealed the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act, 1914 (as amended in 1918). It specified that, under Irish law, Irish citizens (or nationals) were those born in the territory of the whole island of Ireland or those who chose to activate an inherent right to the status derived from either parent, resident or not, who had been born on the island. It drew on the conclusions of the 1930 Commonwealth Conference that each member could define for itself its own nationals while maintaining mutual recognition of common status. It was considered in both Houses from November 1933, passed on 4 April 1935 and signed by the King six days later. Following its enactment, and with mutuality and reciprocity in mind, Ireland introduced its own Aliens Act under which anyone who was not a citizen of S\u00e1orstat \u00c9ireann was an alien. This made the British as alien as any other nationality. But an exemption Order (S.R. + O. No 80 of 1935) excluded them and the peoples of the Commonwealth from the application of the Aliens Act and, hence, permitted the continuation of their free movement into Ireland....The UK, because of the common citizenship of the Commonwealth, had not amended its Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914 (amended 1918) which specified that persons born in what was then the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, as well as the Commonwealth, were British subjects. There being no change in UK law until 1948 meant, as McGuinness<ref>Diarmaid McGuinness, 1998, \u2018Has the Common Travel Area a Future?\u2019. Unpublished paper. Dublin: Law Library, p. 4.</ref> points out, ''that British judicial opinion was able to maintain \u2013 as late as 1942 \u2013 that Ireland's 1922 Constitution \"did no more than confer ... a national character as an Irish citizen within the wider British nationality\"''; and that this remained the case despite the Nationality and Citizenship Act 1935 and the new 1937 Constitution. ''From the British point of view the peoples of all these lands have status as British subjects, and generally there is no discrimination among British subjects as to place of birth within the Commonwealth'' <ref>Irish Independent, 4.2.47, D/T S14002A.</ref> in their access to citizenship rights in the UK.

This was the first example of a Commonwealth member country passing legislation to create its own citizenship distinct from the status of \"British subject\", and it expressly repealed (s. 33) both the British nationality legislation and common law carried over at independence.\n\nWhen the Free State was reconstituted as \"Ireland\" in 1937, following the enactment of the [[Constitution of Ireland]] (''Bunreacht na h\u00c9ireann''), domestic Irish nationality law was left unchanged. References in UK laws to the Free State were soon replaced with \"Eire\", an approximation of the [[Irish language]] name for \"Ireland\", ''[[\u00c9ire]]''.\n\nBritish nationality law continued to recognise citizens of Ireland/\u00c9ire as holding the status of British subjects until the [[British Nationality Act 1948]] came into force on 1 January 1949.\n\n== British Nationality Act 1948 ==\n\n{{Main|British Nationality Act 1948}}\nFollowing Canada's enactment of the [[Canadian Citizenship Act 1946]] (in force from 1 January 1947), the [[Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference]] agreed that every member state, except Ireland which declined to participate at the Conference, would enact its own citizenship law while retaining the common status of British subject. The British Parliament passed the British Nationality Act 1948, which created the status of citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies. Because of [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948|Ireland's impending departure from the Commonwealth]] (on 18 April 1949), special provision was made for the retention by certain Irish citizens of the status of British subject without being citizens of a Commonwealth member state.\n\nAs a result, Irish citizens (\"citizens of Eire\" ''(sic)'') lost British-subject status automatically on 1 January 1949 if they did not acquire citizenship of the UK and Colonies or that of another Commonwealth country, notwithstanding that Ireland did not cease to be one of His Majesty's dominions until 18 April 1949.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mansergh|first1=Nicholas|title=Survey of British Commonwealth Affairs: Problems of Wartime Cooperation and Post-War Change 1939-1952|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136242892}}</ref>\n\nHowever, section 2 of the Act allowed certain Irish citizens who were British subjects before 1949 to apply at any time to the [[Home Secretary|Secretary of State]] to remain British subjects. Applications had to be based on:\n\n* previous Crown service under His Majesty's Government;\n* possession of a British passport; or\n* associations by way of descent, residence or otherwise with the United Kingdom or any [[Crown colony]], [[protectorate]], British [[mandated territory]] or British [[trust territory]].\n\nNo provision was made for the retention of British nationality by Irish citizens born in the Republic of Ireland after 1948. British subject status, as distinct from citizenship of the UK and Colonies, was not transmissible by descent.\n\nFor the purpose of the 1948 act, the \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\" was defined on its post-1922 borders. Hence, birth before 1922 in that part of Ireland that became the Irish Free State was not sufficient ''in itself'' to confer citizenship of the UK and Colonies.{{cn|date=December 2019}} Persons born before 1949 in that part of Ireland that became the Republic of Ireland  became Citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies \"by descent\" in British law on 1 January 1949 if they had a father born in the United Kingdom or a place that was a colony at that date (provided father was married to the person's mother).{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn common with those from the Commonwealth, Irish citizens resident in the United Kingdom, whether they held British subject status or not, were entitled to apply for registration as a Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies after one year's residence, by the 1970s increased to five years.\n\n== Ireland Act 1949 ==\n{{Main|Ireland Act 1949}}\nThe United Kingdom's [[Ireland Act 1949]] came into force on 18 April 1949 and recognised the end of the Irish state's status as a British [[dominion]], which had been effected under the [[Oireachtas|Irish]] [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948]] brought into force in 1949. The 1949 Act was also used by the United Kingdom to \"repair an omission in the British Nationality Act, 1948\".<ref name=hoc1949Jun1>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1949/jun/01/ireland-bill HC Deb 01 June 1949 vol 465 cc2235-51] ([[Secretary of State for Home Affairs]])</ref> The 1948 Act included provisions dealing specifically with the position of \"a person who was a British subject and a citizen of Eire on 31st December, 1948\".<ref name=hoc1949Jun1 /> Because of this, how the British law would apply was dependent on a question of Irish law, namely, who was a \"citizen of Eire\"? The UK Government seriously misunderstood the position under Irish law. The UK [[Secretary of State for Home Affairs]] explained that:<ref name=hoc1949Jun1 />\n\n{{quote|\"[when British Nationality Act was passed the United Kingdom did not know that a person who was born in Southern Ireland of a Southern Irish father and on 6th December, 1922, was domiciled in Northern Ireland was regarded as a citizen of Eire under Eire law. They therefore considered that such a person became a United Kingdom citizen on 1st January, 1949 [in accordance with the British Nationality Act]\".}}\n\nThe impact of this was that many people in Northern Ireland were in theory deprived of a British citizenship status they would otherwise have enjoyed but for Irish law. This was an unintended consequence of the British Nationality Act.\n\nThe Secretary of State also explained the background to the mistake. He reported that under Irish law the question of who was a \"citizen of Eire\" was in part, dependent on whether a person was \"domiciled in the Irish Free State on 6th December, 1922\". In this regard he noted:<ref name=hoc1949Jun1 />\n\n{{quote|\"The important date to bear in mind there is 6th December, 1922, for that was the date...the Irish Free State was constituted, and as constituted on 6th December, 1922, it consisted of the 32 counties with the six counties which now form Northern Ireland having the right to vote themselves out. They did so vote themselves out on 7th December, but on 6th December, 1922, the whole of Ireland, the 32 counties, was the Irish Free State and it was not until 7th December, the next day, the six counties having voted themselves out, that the Irish Free State became confined to the 26 counties.

There appears to be here a suggestion that the status of citizen of the Irish Free State carries no privileges or obligations outside the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State: that the Irish Free State citizen when he goes to France has no 'privileges or obligations' as such. This may not have been intended at all: on the other hand it may have been deliberately inserted in pursuance of a British theory that the citizen of any Dominion, once he gets outside his Dominion, must rely for support on his 'Imperial' status as a 'British Subject'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.difp.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=1355|title=Extract from a memorandum on nationality and citizenship  | work=Documents on Irish Foreign Policy| publisher=[[Royal Irish Academy]], (Irish) Department of Foreign Affairs, [[National Archives of Ireland]] }}</ref>}}\n\n== British subjects with local Irish nationality ==\n\nAccording to Article 3 of the 1922 [[Constitution of the Irish Free State]]\n\n{{quotation|Every person, without distinction of sex, domiciled in the area of the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State (''Saorst\u00e1t Eireann'') at the time of the coming into operation of this Constitution who was born in Ireland or either of whose parents was born in Ireland or who has been ordinarily resident in the area of the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State (Saorst\u00e1t Eireann) for not less than seven years, is a citizen of the Irish Free State (Saorst\u00e1t Eireann) and shall within the limits of the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State (Saorst\u00e1t Eireann) enjoy the privileges and be subject to the obligations of such citizenship [...].}}\n\nThe same Article also stated that \"the conditions governing the future acquisition and termination of citizenship in the Irish Free State\" were to be \"determined by law\". However, no such law was passed until 1935.\n\nFrom the British perspective, Free State citizenship was only enjoyed by its holders \"within the limits of the [Free State's] jurisdiction\". There were some remarkable manifestations of the British perspective in this matter, such as the ''Parkes'' case. In ''Murray v. Parkes'' (1942), the King's Bench Divisional Court found that [[Roscommon]]-born Michael Murray, then aged 33 and living in Leicester, was a [[British subject]] and therefore legitimately subject to conscription into the British Army.

Though unique in the Commonwealth of the day, Irish citizenship, therefore, was not an autonomous status. It was not until the 1930s that 'an Irish citizenship for international purposes was established', independently of a Treaty and Constitution enacted as British statutes. Under the power contemplated in Article 3 of the 1922 Constitution, the Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1935 repealed the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act, 1914 (as amended in 1918). It specified that, under Irish law, Irish citizens (or nationals) were those born in the territory of the whole island of Ireland or those who chose to activate an inherent right to the status derived from either parent, resident or not, who had been born on the island. It drew on the conclusions of the 1930 Commonwealth Conference that each member could define for itself its own nationals while maintaining mutual recognition of common status. It was considered in both Houses from November 1933, passed on 4 April 1935 and signed by the King six days later. Following its enactment, and with mutuality and reciprocity in mind, Ireland introduced its own Aliens Act under which anyone who was not a citizen of S\u00e1orstat \u00c9ireann was an alien. This made the British as alien as any other nationality. But an exemption Order (S.R. + O. No 80 of 1935) excluded them and the peoples of the Commonwealth from the application of the Aliens Act and, hence, permitted the continuation of their free movement into Ireland....The UK, because of the common citizenship of the Commonwealth, had not amended its Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914 (amended 1918) which specified that persons born in what was then the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, as well as the Commonwealth, were British subjects. There being no change in UK law until 1948 meant, as McGuinness<ref>Diarmaid McGuinness, 1998, \u2018Has the Common Travel Area a Future?\u2019. Unpublished paper. Dublin: Law Library, p. 4.</ref> points out, ''that British judicial opinion was able to maintain \u2013 as late as 1942 \u2013 that Ireland's 1922 Constitution \"did no more than confer ... a national character as an Irish citizen within the wider British nationality\"''; and that this remained the case despite the Nationality and Citizenship Act 1935 and the new 1937 Constitution.

This was the first example of a Commonwealth member country passing legislation to create its own citizenship distinct from the status of \"British subject\", and it expressly repealed (s. 33) both the British nationality legislation and common law carried over at independence.\n\nWhen the Free State was reconstituted as \"Ireland\" in 1937, following the enactment of the [[Constitution of Ireland]] (''Bunreacht na h\u00c9ireann''), domestic Irish nationality law was left unchanged. References in UK laws to the Free State were soon replaced with \"Eire\", an approximation of the [[Irish language]] name for \"Ireland\", ''[[\u00c9ire]]''.\n\nBritish nationality law continued to recognise citizens of Ireland/\u00c9ire as holding the status of British subjects until the [[British Nationality Act 1948]] came into force on 1 January 1949.\n\n== British Nationality Act 1948 ==\n\n{{Main|British Nationality Act 1948}}\nFollowing Canada's enactment of the [[Canadian Citizenship Act 1946]] (in force from 1 January 1947), the [[Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference]] agreed that every member state, except Ireland which declined to participate at the Conference, would enact its own citizenship law while retaining the common status of British subject. The British Parliament passed the British Nationality Act 1948, which created the status of citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies. Because of [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948|Ireland's impending departure from the Commonwealth]] (on 18 April 1949), special provision was made for the retention by certain Irish citizens of the status of British subject without being citizens of a Commonwealth member state.\n\nAs a result, Irish citizens (\"citizens of Eire\" ''(sic)'') lost British-subject status automatically on 1 January 1949 if they did not acquire citizenship of the UK and Colonies or that of another Commonwealth country, notwithstanding that Ireland did not cease to be one of His Majesty's dominions until 18 April 1949.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mansergh|first1=Nicholas|title=Survey of British Commonwealth Affairs: Problems of Wartime Cooperation and Post-War Change 1939-1952|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136242892}}</ref>\n\nHowever, section 2 of the Act allowed certain Irish citizens who were British subjects before 1949 to apply at any time to the [[Home Secretary|Secretary of State]] to remain British subjects.

British subject status, as distinct from citizenship of the UK and Colonies, was not transmissible by descent.\n\nFor the purpose of the 1948 act, the \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\" was defined on its post-1922 borders. Hence, birth before 1922 in that part of Ireland that became the Irish Free State was not sufficient ''in itself'' to confer citizenship of the UK and Colonies.{{cn|date=December 2019}} Persons born before 1949 in that part of Ireland that became the Republic of Ireland  became Citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies \"by descent\" in British law on 1 January 1949 if they had a father born in the United Kingdom or a place that was a colony at that date (provided father was married to the person's mother).{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn common with those from the Commonwealth, Irish citizens resident in the United Kingdom, whether they held British subject status or not, were entitled to apply for registration as a Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies after one year's residence, by the 1970s increased to five years.\n\n== Ireland Act 1949 ==\n{{Main|Ireland Act 1949}}\nThe United Kingdom's [[Ireland Act 1949]] came into force on 18 April 1949 and recognised the end of the Irish state's status as a British [[dominion]], which had been effected under the [[Oireachtas|Irish]] [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948]] brought into force in 1949.

They therefore considered that such a person became a United Kingdom citizen on 1st January, 1949 [in accordance with the British Nationality Act]\".}}\n\nThe impact of this was that many people in Northern Ireland were in theory deprived of a British citizenship status they would otherwise have enjoyed but for Irish law. This was an unintended consequence of the British Nationality Act.\n\nThe Secretary of State also explained the background to the mistake. He reported that under Irish law the question of who was a \"citizen of Eire\" was in part, dependent on whether a person was \"domiciled in the Irish Free State on 6th December, 1922\". In this regard he noted:<ref name=hoc1949Jun1 />\n\n{{quote|\"The important date to bear in mind there is 6th December, 1922, for that was the date...the Irish Free State was constituted, and as constituted on 6th December, 1922, it consisted of the 32 counties with the six counties which now form Northern Ireland having the right to vote themselves out. They did so vote themselves out on 7th December, but on 6th December, 1922, the whole of Ireland, the 32 counties, was the Irish Free State and it was not until 7th December, the next day, the six counties having voted themselves out, that the Irish Free State became confined to the 26 counties. Therefore, the Eire law, by inserting the date 6th December, 1922, and attaching to that the domicile, meant that anybody domiciled inside the island of Ireland on 6th December, 1922, was a citizen of Eire.\"}}\n\nThe amendment made to the British Nationality Act under the Ireland Act was intended to make it clear, in summary, that regardless of the position under Irish law, the affected persons domiciled in Northern Ireland on 6 December 1949 would not be deprived of a British citizenship status they would otherwise have enjoyed but for Irish law.\n\nSection 5 of the 1949 Act conferred ''[[Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies|Citizenship of the UK and Colonies]]'' (CUKC) on any Irish-born person meeting all the following criteria:<ref>{{cite journal |title=British Nationality and Irish Citizenship |author=R.

It is sometimes known as \"The First City of Venezuela\", for being the first city in Venezuela to adopt various types of public services, including electricity, as well as for being located adjacent to shores of Lake Maracaibo, where the name of Venezuela allegedly originates.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.geographia.com/venezuela/history.htm|title=Venezuela - An Introduction|website=www.geographia.com|access-date=2019-06-14}}</ref> \n\nEarly indigenous settlements around the area were of [[Arawaks|Arawak]] and [[Kalina people|Carib]] origin.

Founded in 1574 as Nueva Zamora de la Laguna de Maracaibo by Captain [https://www.britannica.com/place/Maracaibo Captain Pedro Maldonado], the city became a transshipment point for inland settlements after [[Gibraltar, Venezuela|Gibraltar]], at the head of the lake, had been destroyed by pirates in 1669. It was not until the first decades of the 17th century that the first town was settled.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Maracaibo|title=Maracaibo {{!}} Venezuela|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-06-14}}</ref> Petroleum was discovered in 1917, leading to a large increase in population from migration.\n\nMaracaibo is served by [[La Chinita International Airport]].

The [[La Chiquinquir\u00e1 Church (Maracaibo)|La Chiquinquir\u00e1 Church]] catholic church within the city.\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe name Maracaibo is said to come from the brave ''[[cacique]]'' (Indian chief) Mara, a young native who valiantly resisted the Spaniards and died fighting them. Legend says that when Mara fell, the Indians shouted \"''Mara kay\u00f3!''\" (Mara fell!), thus originating the city name --although it would be strange for them to shout in Spanish. Other historians say that the first name of this land in the local language was \"Maara-iwo\" meaning \"Place where serpents abound\".\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Royal Coat of Arms of New Zamora of Maracaibo.svg|thumb|First version of Coat of Arms with royal elements, according to ''Discrezi\u00f3n de la laguna de la ciudad de Maracaibo'' in [[General Archive of the Indies]].|left|200px]]\n\n===Foundation===\nThe first indigenous settlements were of [[Arawaks|Arawak]] and [[Kalina people|Carib]] origin. Around the main group were the [[A\u00f1u]] tribe who built rows of [[stilt house]]s all over the northern riviera of the Lake Maracaibo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.efemeridesvenezolanas.com/html/maracaibo.htm|title=Error|author=Irama Iglesias|work=efemeridevenezolana}}</ref> The first Europeans arrived in 1499.\n\nThe city was founded three times: the first time was during the [[Klein-Venedig]] period (1528&ndash;1546), when the [[Welser]] bankers of [[Augsburg]] received a concession over [[Venezuela Province]] from [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I. of Spain]]. In August 1529, the German [[Ambrosius Ehinger]] made his first expedition to [[Lake Maracaibo]], which was bitterly opposed by the indigenous [[Coquivacoa]]. After winning a series of bloody battles, he founded the settlement on 8 September 1529. Ehinger named the settlement New Nuremberg ({{lang-de|Neu-N\u00fcrnberg}}) and the lake after the valiant [[cacique|chieftain]] Mara of the Coquivacoa, who had died in the fighting. The city was renamed Maracaibo after the Spanish took possession.<ref>[http://www.wasistwas.de/geschichte/alle-artikel/artikel/link//aafd6793cf/article/das-imperium-der-welser/-7c05c71e06.html Das Imperium der Welser] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422023929/http://www.wasistwas.de/geschichte/alle-artikel/artikel/link//aafd6793cf/article/das-imperium-der-welser/-7c05c71e06.html |date=2012-04-22 }}</ref> The lack of activity in the zone made [[Nikolaus Federmann]] evacuate the village in 1535 and move its population to [[Santa Marta]] near the then capital of [[Venezuela Province]], [[Santa Ana de Coro]].\n\nA second attempt by Captain [https://www.britannica.com/place/Maracaibo Alonso Pacheco] in 1569 suffered a brief setback when the city had to be evacuated in 1573 due to ferocious attacks by native local tribes. The European settlement returned a short while later, in 1574, however, for which it was re-founded by Captain Pedro Maldonado under Governor [[Diego de Mazariegos]]' command and assuming the name of Nueva Zamora de Maracaibo. \"Nueva Zamora\" comes from Mazariego's place of birth, Zamora, in Spain. Since its definite foundation, the town began to develop as a whole. It is based on the western side of [[Lake Maracaibo]], the dominant feature of the oil-rich [[Maracaibo Basin]]. Favored by prevailing winds and a protected harbour, the city is located on the shores of the lake where the narrows, which eventually lead to the [[Gulf of Venezuela]], first become pronounced.\n\n===Pirates' attacks===\nThe Dutch corsair [[Henrik de Gerard]] plundered Maracaibo in 1614, and in 1642 the city was attacked by the British pirate [[William Jackson (pirate)|William Jackson]]. In 1667, [[l'Olonnais]] with a fleet of eight ships and a crew of six hundred pirates sacked Maracaibo and Gibraltar. En route, l'Olonnais crossed paths with a Spanish treasure ship, which he captured, along with its rich cargo of [[Cocoa bean|cacao]], [[gemstone]]s and more than 260,000 [[pieces of eight]].\n\nIn March 1669, [[Henry Morgan]] sacked Maracaibo, which emptied when his fleet was first spied, and moved on to the Spanish settlement of Gibraltar on the inside of Lake Maracaibo in search of more treasure. A few weeks later, when he attempted to sail out of the lake, Morgan found an occupied fort blocking the inlet to the Caribbean, along with three Spanish ships. These were the ''Magdalena'', the ''San Luis'', and the ''Soledad''. He destroyed the Magdalena and burned the San Luis by sending a dummy ship full of gunpowder to explode near them, after which the crew of the ''Soledad'' surrendered. By faking a landward attack on the fort, thereby convincing the Spanish governor to shift his cannon, he eluded their guns and escaped.<ref>''Harry Morgan's Way'', (AlisonPress, 1977), Dudley Pope, {{ISBN|978-1842324820}}</ref><ref>''Caribbean'', James A.Michener, Guild Publishing, 1989, ASIN: B00EFKMICY</ref>\n\nIn June 1678, [[Michel de Grammont]] French commander of six ships and 700 men captured Maracaibo then followed the plundering of several smaller towns as [[Gibraltar, Venezuela|Gibraltar]], penetrating as far inland as [[Trujillo, Trujillo|Trujillo]].\n\n=== Venezuelan independence ===\n\nIn 1810, the province of Maracaibo did not join the [[First Republic of Venezuela]] and remained loyal to the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish crown]]. Maracaibo then held the seat of the [[Captaincy General of Venezuela]].\n\nIn 1821, uprisings in favor of independence began to lead to warfare and hostility. The [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalists]], led by [[Francisco Tom\u00e1s Morales]], fought with the patriots, led by [[Rafael Urdaneta]], to take back control over the province in the Juana de \u00c1vila Battle, and Morales brought back Spanish rule in 1822 until he was defeated at the [[Battle of Lake Maracaibo]] on 24 July 1823, culminating Venezuela's struggle for independence.\n\n=== Isolation period ===\nFor about 390 years, Maracaibo remained isolated and separated from the rest of the country. Transportation was only possible across the lake by ferry or other marine transport.\n\nCars, buses, and lorries, with their constant flow of manufactured goods and agricultural product, depended on the ferry system between the city and the eastern shore with their roads to connect to the country's motorway system. Maracaibo and the Lake Maracaibo region's economy was more linked to [[Colombia]] than to eastern Venezuela due to the natural route available through Lake Maracaibo then leading to the sea.\n\nThis isolation was both a challenge and an advantage. The very nature of the city's location made for a population known for their independent thought and character. The history of this region is rife with stories about the creation of an independent and sovereign nation apart from Venezuela, a nation called ''La Rep\u00fablica Independiente del Zulia'', which means ''The Independent Republic of Zulia'', but this has never come to be.\n\nIn January 1903, as the naval blockade of Venezuela continued during the negotiations with presidente [[Cipriano Castro]], the German warship ''[[SMS Panther]]'' attempted to enter [[Lake Maracaibo]], which was a center of German commercial activity. On 17 January, it exchanged fire with the settlement of Fort San Carlos, but withdrew after half an hour, as shallow waters prevented it getting close enough to the fort to be effective. The Venezuelans claimed this as a victory, and in response the German commander sent the ''[[SMS Vineta]]'', with heavier weapons, to set an example. On 21 January, the ''SMS Vineta'' bombarded the fort, setting fire to it and destroying it, with the death of 25 civilians in the nearby town.\n\nIn 1908, the ''Friesland'', [[HNLMS Gelderland (1898)|Gelderland]] and [[HNLMS Jacob van Heemskerck (1906)|Jacob van Heemskerck]]\nwere sent to patrol the Venezuelan coast during the ''[[Cipriano Castro|second Castro crisis]]''. ''Friesland'' guarded the entry way to Maracaibo.<ref name=\"scheepvaartmuseum.nl :: Maritieme kalender 1908\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hetscheepvaartmuseum.nl/knowledgebase/calendar%7C1908|publisher=Hetscheepvaartmuseum.nl|title=Maritieme kalender 1908|accessdate=2013-07-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Building of the bridge ===\n[[File:Monumento a la Chinita I.JPG|thumbnail|300px|Basilica of Our Lady of the Rosary of Chiquinquir\u00e1]]\nThe dictatorial regime of General [[Marcos P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez]] in the 1950s set as a goal the construction of a bridge connecting the two lake shores. Various bridge projects for the spanning of the Lake Maracaibo narrows near the city were in the works. The general's government had decided that this \"city of independent thought\" should be more \"connected\" to the rest of the country.\n\nProposals for a bridge design that included rail transport and tourist facilities were seriously considered. The fall of the P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez government on 23 January 1958, quickly led to a less elaborate design project that was approved and funded by a democratic and more conservative government.\n\nThe building of \"El Puente Sobre El Lago de Maracaibo \"General Rafael Urdaneta\"\u2014([[General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge]] over Lake Maracaibo) named after the distinguished General [[Rafael Urdaneta|hero]] of the War of Independence was opened to public traffic in 1962. The project was completed on schedule in 40 months.\n\nThis bridge construction project was a remarkable feat. Built under very difficult conditions, when completed, it became the longest prestressed concrete bridge in the world. The structure is in constant use and remains today as the most important link between Maracaibo, along with much of the state of Zulia, and the rest of Venezuela.\n[[File:Maracaibo city skyline july 2007.jpg|thumb|center|1000px|Panoramic view of Maracaibo City.]]\n\n=== Modern times ===\nMaracaibo has become a large metropolitan city, comprising two municipalities: to the north the municipality of Maracaibo and to the south the San Francisco municipality (established in 1995). In recent years, due to political/economic and cultural reasons, many have moved to Maracaibo from rural areas and other cities (including [[Caracas]]).\n[[File:Ancient office Mene Grande Oil Company.jpg|thumb|right|Former headquarters of the Mene Grande Oil Company]]\nIn the political arena, the citizens of Maracaibo (and most other cities and municipalities in Zulia state) have in recent years voted for a competitive political system in where the governor is from a certain political party and the mayor or mayors are from the opposite political party.\n\nMaracaibo also boasts one of the best universities in the country, the state university. ''[[University of Zulia|La Universidad del Zulia]]'' (LUZ) is well renowned for its excellent law, medical and engineering schools as many other disciplines. Other universities and schools include [[Universidad Dr. Rafael Belloso Chac\u00edn]] (URBE) and [[Universidad Rafael Urdaneta]], with one of the country's leading psychology schools.\n\nThe Diocese of Maracaibo (23 July 1965) was elevated to [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Maracaibo|Archdiocese]] on 30 April 1966 by [[Pope Paulus VI]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dmara.html#hist|title=Maracaibo (Archdiocese) [Catholic-Hierarchy]|author=David M.

The following excerpts describe the local population of Maracaibo:\n\n:''They perform coasting, or long voyages, with equal facility; and when all trade is suspended by the operations of war, they enter privateers. Bred up in the neighbourhood of the lake, they are mostly all expert swimmers and excellent divers. Their reputation stands equally high as soldiers. Those who do not enter into the sea service, form plantations, or assist in cultivating those that belong to their fathers. Nothing proves better their aptitude for this kind of occupation, than the immense flocks of cattle with which the savannas of Maracaybo {{sic}} are covered.''\n\nHe also notes the appreciation of literature, the arts, education, and culture among the people of Maracaibo:\n\n:''But what confers the greatest honour on the inhabitants of Maracaibo, is their application to literature; in which, notwithstanding the wretched state of public education, they make considerable progress....They likewise acquired the art of elocution, and of writing their mother tongue with the greatest purity; in a word, they possessed all the qualities that characterise men of letters.''\n\n==Economy==\nZulia\u00b4s main income comes from oil extraction and refining, agriculture (coffee, rice, maize, cassava, cocoa, sugar cane),\nlivestock production, and mining (clay, limestone, coal and sand{{cn|date=March 2017}}).\n\n=== Medicine ===\n[[Huntington's disease]] prevalence worldwide is 5\u201310 cases per 100,000 persons. One of the highest incidences is in the isolated populations of the Lake Maracaibo region of Venezuela, where HD affects up to 700 per 100,000 persons.<ref>\"Huntington's disease\" ''[[The Lancet]]'' 369 (9557): 218\u201328 [221]. doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60111-1. {{PMID|17240289}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Location ===\nThe Maracaibo Municipality is currently divided into 18 parishes, which are\n{{Maracaibo}}\n\n===Climate===\nMaracaibo is one of the hottest cities of [[Venezuela]]. The [[rain shadow]] of the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]] gives the city a [[semiarid climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification system|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''BSh'') attenuated only by the moderating influence of the lake; Maracaibo\u2019s average historical temperature is {{convert|29|C|F|1}}. In the past, the climate of the city, indeed all along the coast of Lake Maracaibo, was unhealthy due to the combination of high temperatures with high humidity. Today, control of plagues and the effects of urban development has largely eradicated these health problems. The registered high temperature of the city is {{convert|41|C|F|1}}, and the lowest is {{convert|18|C|F|1}}.\n{{Weather box\n|location = Maracaibo (1970\u20131998)\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan record high C = 36.4\n|Feb record high C = 39.4\n|Mar record high C = 37.9\n|Apr record high C = 39.6\n|May record high C = 37.8\n|Jun record high C = 38.0\n|Jul record high C = 38.8\n|Aug record high C = 38.1\n|Sep record high C = 39.0\n|Oct record high C = 36.6\n|Nov record high C = 36.3\n|Dec record high C = 35.8\n|year record high C = 39.6\n|Jan high C = 32.5\n|Feb high C = 32.8\n|Mar high C = 33.1\n|Apr high C = 33.1\n|May high C = 33.1\n|Jun high C = 33.6\n|Jul high C = 34.1\n|Aug high C = 34.2\n|Sep high C = 33.6\n|Oct high C = 32.5\n|Nov high C = 32.4\n|Dec high C = 32.5\n|year high C = 33.1\n|Jan mean C = 27.7\n|Feb mean C = 28.0\n|Mar mean C = 28.6\n|Apr mean C = 29.0\n|May mean C = 29.1\n|Jun mean C = 29.3\n|Jul mean C = 29.5\n|Aug mean C = 29.6\n|Sep mean C = 29.1\n|Oct mean C = 28.3\n|Nov mean C = 28.3\n|Dec mean C = 27.9\n|year mean C = 28.7\n|Jan low C = 22.8\n|Feb low C = 23.2\n|Mar low C = 24.1\n|Apr low C = 24.8\n|May low C = 25.0\n|Jun low C = 24.9\n|Jul low C = 24.9\n|Aug low C = 24.9\n|Sep low C = 24.6\n|Oct low C = 24.1\n|Nov low C = 24.1\n|Dec low C = 23.3\n|year low C = 24.2\n|Jan record low C = 19.2\n|Feb record low C = 18.8\n|Mar record low C = 20.4\n|Apr record low C = 20.7\n|May record low C = 20.5\n|Jun record low C = 20.2\n|Jul record low C = 21.0\n|Aug record low C = 20.2\n|Sep record low C = 20.2\n|Oct record low C = 20.0\n|Nov record low C = 20.6\n|Dec record low C = 18.9\n|year record low C = 18.8\n|rain colour = green\n|Jan rain mm = 5.1\n|Feb rain mm = 2.7\n|Mar rain mm = 5.9\n|Apr rain mm = 52.1\n|May rain mm = 66.8\n|Jun rain mm = 55.4\n|Jul rain mm = 26.5\n|Aug rain mm = 60.0\n|Sep rain mm = 104.0\n|Oct rain mm = 114.4\n|Nov rain mm = 70.6\n|Dec rain mm = 16.9\n|year rain mm = 580.4\n|Jan rain days = 0.6\n|Feb rain days = 0.3\n|Mar rain days = 0.6\n|Apr rain days = 3.6\n|May rain days = 6.1\n|Jun rain days = 6.7\n|Jul rain days = 3.6\n|Aug rain days = 5.8\n|Sep rain days = 8.1\n|Oct rain days = 9.2\n|Nov rain days = 5.3\n|Dec rain days = 1.7\n|year rain days = 51.6\n|unit rain days = 1.0 mm\n|Jan humidity = 69.0\n|Feb humidity = 68.5\n|Mar humidity = 68.0\n|Apr humidity = 71.5\n|May humidity = 73.5\n|Jun humidity = 71.0\n|Jul humidity = 69.0\n|Aug humidity = 69.5\n|Sep humidity = 72.0\n|Oct humidity = 75.0\n|Nov humidity = 73.0\n|Dec humidity = 72.0\n|year humidity = 71.0\n|Jan sun = 266.6\n|Feb sun = 240.8\n|Mar sun = 244.9\n|Apr sun = 183.0\n|May sun = 179.8\n|Jun sun = 201.0\n|Jul sun = 244.9\n|Aug sun = 232.5\n|Sep sun = 192.0\n|Oct sun = 182.9\n|Nov sun = 204.0\n|Dec sun = 238.7\n|year sun = 2611.1\n|source 1 = '''Instituto Nacional de Meteorolog\u00eda e Hidrolog\u00eda (INAMEH)'''<ref name=\"clima-t\">\n{{cite web\n |url=http://www.inameh.gob.ve/documentos/ESTADISTICOS_BASICOS_TyHR_EXTREM.pdf\n |title=Estad\u00edsticos B\u00e1sicos Temperaturas y Humedades Relativas M\u00e1ximas y M\u00ednimas Medias\n |work=INAMEH\n |publisher=Instituto Nacional de Meteorolog\u00eda e Hidrolog\u00eda\n |language=Spanish\n |url-status=dead\n |accessdate=15 May 2014\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615065531/http://www.inameh.gob.ve/documentos/ESTADISTICOS_BASICOS_TyHR_EXTREM.pdf\n |archivedate=15 June 2013\n}}</ref><ref name=\"clima-tm\">\n{{cite web\n |url=http://www.inameh.gob.ve/documentos/ESTADISTICOS_BASICOS_TyHR_MEDIAS.pdf\n |title=Estad\u00edsticos B\u00e1sicos Temperaturas y Humedades Relativas Medias\n |work=INAMEH\n |publisher=Instituto Nacional de Meteorolog\u00eda e Hidrolog\u00eda\n |language=Spanish\n |url-status=dead\n |accessdate=15 May 2014\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615085231/http://www.inameh.gob.ve/documentos/ESTADISTICOS_BASICOS_TyHR_MEDIAS.pdf\n |archivedate=15 June 2013\n}}</ref>\n|source 2 = NOAA (extremes and sun 1961\u20131990),<ref name=\"NOAA\">{{cite web\n| url = ftp://ftp.atdd.noaa.gov/pub/GCOS/WMO-Normals/RA-III/VN/80407.TXT\n| title = Maracaibo Climate Normals 1961-1990\n|publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]\n| accessdate = 15 May 2014}}</ref> [[World Meteorological Organization]] (precipitation, 1961\u20131990)<ref name=WMO>\n{{cite web\n| url = http://worldweather.wmo.int/135/c01197.htm\n| title = World Weather Information Service -

Maracaibo, and the rest of Zulia, are represented in [[baseball]] by the [[\u00c1guilas del Zulia]], a Venezuelan winter league team that plays in the [[Liga Venezolana de B\u00e9isbol Profesional]], and is based in the [[Estadio Luis Aparicio El Grande]]. The city's [[basketball]] team is [[Gaiteros del Zulia]], which plays in the [[Liga Profesional de Baloncesto]] de Venezuela. Its home is the 5.000-people ''Pedro El\u00edas Belisario Aponte'' stadium. Other teams include the [[Uni\u00f3n Atl\u00e9tico Maracaibo]] and the [[Zulia FC]] in [[Football (soccer)|football]], the [[Maracaibo Rugby Football Club]] and the [[Zulianos Rugby Club]].\n\nIn the [[2000 Little League World Series]], the Sierrra Maestra Little League of Maracaibo, Venezuela defeated Bellaire Little League of Bellaire, Texas in the championship game of the 54th Little League World Series. The Coquivocoa Little League team from Maracaibo placed third in the [[1974 Little League World Series]].\n\nRugby in Venezuela was first played in Maracaibo, thanks to the influence of the English community based on the [[Zulia State]]\n\nTeam:\n* Baseball: [[\u00c1guilas del Zulia]] BBC.\n* Basketball: [[Gaiteros del Zulia]]\n* Soccer: [[Uni\u00f3n Atl\u00e9tico Maracaibo]], [[Zulia FC]]\n* Rugby: [[Maracaibo Rugby Football Club \"Oil Blacks\"]], [[Zulianos Rugby Club]]\n\n== Culture ==\n[[File:Calle Carabobo de Maracaibo.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Carabobo street contains much of the city's famous colonial architecture]]\n\nCulture in Maracaibo is very indigenous and unique, is recognized in every state and city in Venezuela, and is very influential with its [[Gaita (music style)|gaitas]], desserts, style, living, and customs. Most major houses of advertising in Venezuela acknowledge how opposite the culture of Maracaibo is from that of Caracas. Studies of both prove, for example, that Caracas' leading soft drink brand is [[Coca-Cola|Coke]], while in Maracaibo it is [[Pepsi]]. This has made many brands create special localized advertising of their products (including several Pepsi commercials spoken by local celebrities).\n\nMarabinos are extremely proud of their city, their culture, and all of Zulia. They usually claim that Venezuela wouldn't be the country it actually is without Zulia. Rivalry with inhabitants of other regions is common, specially with ''Gochos'' (people of the Trujillo, [[M\u00e9rida State|M\u00e9rida]] and T\u00e1chira state) and ''[[Caraque\u00f1o]]s'' (people of the city of [[Caracas]]).\n\nThe Gaita is a style of Venezuelan folk music from Maracaibo. According to [[Joan Corominas]], it may come from gaits, the Gothic word for \"goat\", which is the skin generally used for the membrane of the furro instrument. Other instruments used in gaita include maracas, cuatro, charrasca and tambora (Venezuelan drum). Song themes range from humorous and love songs to protest songs.The style became popular throughout Venezuela in the 1960s, and it fused with other styles such as salsa and merengue in the 1970s. Famous gaita groups include Maracaibo 15, Gran Coquivacoa, Barrio Obrero, Cardenales del \u00c9xito, Koquimba, Melody Gaita, Guaco, Estrellas del Zulia, Saladillo, and many others.\n[[File:Mural (Venezuela).JPG|thumb|1000px|center|Mural in the Libertador Avenue.]]\n\n=== Museums, cultural centers and theaters ===\n[[File:Tranv\u00eda de Maracaibo I.jpg|thumb|240px|Tram of Maracaibo.]]\n* Museo de Arte Contempor\u00e1neo del estado Zulia (MACZUL)\n* Museo [[General Rafael Urdaneta]]\n* Museo Municipal de Artes Gr\u00e1ficas \"Balmiro Le\u00f3n\"\n* Centro de Bellas Artes de Maracaibo\n* Centro de Arte de Maracaibo \"[[L\u00eda Berm\u00fadez]]\"\n* [[Baralt Theater|Teatro Baralt]]\n*Museo de la Gaita\n\n=== Libraries ===\n* [http://www.bibliotecapublicadelzulia.org.ve Biblioteca Publica del Zulia]\n* Biblioteca P\u00fablica \"Arturo Uslar Pietri\"\n* Biblioteca \"Dr. Pedro Alciro Barboza de la Torre\"\n* Biblioteca P\u00fablica \"Sim\u00f3n Palmar\"\n* [http://www.cevaz.org Biblioteca P\u00fablica \"Lu\u00eds Guillermo Pineda Belloso\" (De car\u00e1cter p\u00fablico, biling\u00fce y circulante)]\n* Biblioteca P\u00fablica Especializada \"Pedag\u00f3gica\"\n* Biblioteca P\u00fablica Especializada \"SEDINI\"\n*Biblioteca Privada \"Dr. Nectario Andrade Labarca\"\n\n== Notable natives ==\n{{Cleanup|section|date=November 2010}}\n* [[Betty Cecilia Lugo]] - Philanthropist\n* [[Teolindo Acosta]] - baseball player\n* [[Guaco|Gustavo Aguado]] - musician, singer and leader of Guaco, Venezuela's most influential music band\n* [[Ricardo Aguirre]] - composer and singer\n* [[Daniel Alvarado]] - singer and actor\n* [[Wilson \u00c1lvarez]] - Major League Baseball left-handed pitcher\n* [[Ernesto Aparicio (baseball)|Ernesto Aparicio]] - Major League Baseball baseball player, manager, and team owner\n* [[Luis Aparicio]] - former shortstop in Major League Baseball and member of the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]]\n*[[:es:Pedro Aranguren|Pedro Aranguren]]- militar\n* [[Eduardo Arcila Far\u00edas]] - journalist and historian\n* [[Rafael Maria Baralt]] - diplomat, writer, philologist, historian, first Latin American to occupy a chair at the 'Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola'\n* [[Huascar Barradas]] - flutist\n*[[Rafael Belloso Chac\u00edn]] - physician\n* [[:es:Luis Barrera Linares|Luis Barrera Linares]] - writer, academic, teacher of [[Universidad Simon Bolivar]]\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Bracho]] - baseball pitcher\n* [[Antonio Bri\u00f1ez]] - first manager to win a National Amateur Baseball championship to Venezuela\n* [[Mar\u00eda Calca\u00f1o]] - poet\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Casanova]] - baseball player and manager of the Venezuelan team that won the gold medal in 1959 Panamerican Games\n* [[Abel Castellano Jr.]] - jockey\n* [[Javier Castellano]]- jockey [[Eclipse Award]] 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016.

It is sometimes known as \"The First City of Venezuela\", for being the first city in Venezuela to adopt various types of public services, including electricity, as well as for being located adjacent to shores of Lake Maracaibo, where the name of Venezuela allegedly originates.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.geographia.com/venezuela/history.htm|title=Venezuela - An Introduction|website=www.geographia.com|access-date=2019-06-14}}</ref> \n\nEarly indigenous settlements around the area were of [[Arawaks|Arawak]] and [[Kalina people|Carib]] origin. Maracaibo\u2019s founding date is disputed. There were failed attempts to found the city\u2014in 1529, by Captain [[Ambrosius Ehinger|Ambrosio Ehinger]], and in 1569, by Captain [[Alonso Pacheco]]. Founded in 1574 as Nueva Zamora de la Laguna de Maracaibo by Captain [[Captain Pedro Maldonado]], the city became a transshipment point for inland settlements after [[Gibraltar, Venezuela|Gibraltar]], at the head of the lake, had been destroyed by pirates in 1669. It was not until the first decades of the 17th century that the first town was settled.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Maracaibo|title=Maracaibo {{!}} Venezuela|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-06-14}}</ref> Petroleum was discovered in 1917, leading to a large increase in population from migration.\n\nMaracaibo is served by [[La Chinita International Airport]]. The [[General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge]] connects Maracaibo with the rest of the country. The [[La Chiquinquir\u00e1 Church (Maracaibo)|La Chiquinquir\u00e1 Church]] catholic church within the city.\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe name Maracaibo is said to come from the brave ''[[cacique]]'' (Indian chief) Mara, a young native who valiantly resisted the Spaniards and died fighting them. Legend says that when Mara fell, the Indians shouted \"''Mara kay\u00f3!''\" (Mara fell!), thus originating the city name --although it would be strange for them to shout in Spanish. Other historians say that the first name of this land in the local language was \"Maara-iwo\" meaning \"Place where serpents abound\".\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Royal Coat of Arms of New Zamora of Maracaibo.svg|thumb|First version of Coat of Arms with royal elements, according to ''Discrezi\u00f3n de la laguna de la ciudad de Maracaibo'' in [[General Archive of the Indies]].|left|200px]]\n\n===Foundation===\nThe first indigenous settlements were of [[Arawaks|Arawak]] and [[Kalina people|Carib]] origin. Around the main group were the [[A\u00f1u]] tribe who built rows of [[stilt house]]s all over the northern riviera of the Lake Maracaibo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.efemeridesvenezolanas.com/html/maracaibo.htm|title=Error|author=Irama Iglesias|work=efemeridevenezolana}}</ref> The first Europeans arrived in 1499.\n\nThe city was founded three times: the first time was during the [[Klein-Venedig]] period (1528&ndash;1546), when the [[Welser]] bankers of [[Augsburg]] received a concession over [[Venezuela Province]] from [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I. of Spain]]. In August 1529, the German [[Ambrosius Ehinger]] made his first expedition to [[Lake Maracaibo]], which was bitterly opposed by the indigenous [[Coquivacoa]]. After winning a series of bloody battles, he founded the settlement on 8 September 1529. Ehinger named the settlement New Nuremberg ({{lang-de|Neu-N\u00fcrnberg}}) and the lake after the valiant [[cacique|chieftain]] Mara of the Coquivacoa, who had died in the fighting. The city was renamed Maracaibo after the Spanish took possession.<ref>[http://www.wasistwas.de/geschichte/alle-artikel/artikel/link//aafd6793cf/article/das-imperium-der-welser/-7c05c71e06.html Das Imperium der Welser] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422023929/http://www.wasistwas.de/geschichte/alle-artikel/artikel/link//aafd6793cf/article/das-imperium-der-welser/-7c05c71e06.html |date=2012-04-22 }}</ref> The lack of activity in the zone made [[Nikolaus Federmann]] evacuate the village in 1535 and move its population to [[Santa Marta]] near the then capital of [[Venezuela Province]], [[Santa Ana de Coro]].\n\nA second attempt by Captain [[Alonso Pacheco]] in 1569 suffered a brief setback when the city had to be evacuated in 1573 due to ferocious attacks by native local tribes. The European settlement returned a short while later, in 1574, however, for which it was re-founded by Captain Pedro Maldonado under Governor [[Diego de Mazariegos]]' command and assuming the name of Nueva Zamora de Maracaibo. \"Nueva Zamora\" comes from Mazariego's place of birth, Zamora, in Spain. Since its definite foundation, the town began to develop as a whole. It is based on the western side of [[Lake Maracaibo]], the dominant feature of the oil-rich [[Maracaibo Basin]]. Favored by prevailing winds and a protected harbour, the city is located on the shores of the lake where the narrows, which eventually lead to the [[Gulf of Venezuela]], first become pronounced.\n\n===Pirates' attacks===\nThe Dutch corsair [[Henrik de Gerard]] plundered Maracaibo in 1614, and in 1642 the city was attacked by the British pirate [[William Jackson (pirate)|William Jackson]]. In 1667, [[l'Olonnais]] with a fleet of eight ships and a crew of six hundred pirates sacked Maracaibo and Gibraltar. En route, l'Olonnais crossed paths with a Spanish treasure ship, which he captured, along with its rich cargo of [[Cocoa bean|cacao]], [[gemstone]]s and more than 260,000 [[pieces of eight]].\n\nIn March 1669, [[Henry Morgan]] sacked Maracaibo, which emptied when his fleet was first spied, and moved on to the Spanish settlement of Gibraltar on the inside of Lake Maracaibo in search of more treasure. A few weeks later, when he attempted to sail out of the lake, Morgan found an occupied fort blocking the inlet to the Caribbean, along with three Spanish ships. These were the ''Magdalena'', the ''San Luis'', and the ''Soledad''. He destroyed the Magdalena and burned the San Luis by sending a dummy ship full of gunpowder to explode near them, after which the crew of the ''Soledad'' surrendered. By faking a landward attack on the fort, thereby convincing the Spanish governor to shift his cannon, he eluded their guns and escaped.<ref>''Harry Morgan's Way'', (AlisonPress, 1977), Dudley Pope, {{ISBN|978-1842324820}}</ref><ref>''Caribbean'', James A.Michener, Guild Publishing, 1989, ASIN: B00EFKMICY</ref>\n\nIn June 1678, [[Michel de Grammont]] French commander of six ships and 700 men captured Maracaibo then followed the plundering of several smaller towns as [[Gibraltar, Venezuela|Gibraltar]], penetrating as far inland as [[Trujillo, Trujillo|Trujillo]].\n\n=== Venezuelan independence ===\n\nIn 1810, the province of Maracaibo did not join the [[First Republic of Venezuela]] and remained loyal to the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish crown]]. Maracaibo then held the seat of the [[Captaincy General of Venezuela]].\n\nIn 1821, uprisings in favor of independence began to lead to warfare and hostility. The [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalists]], led by [[Francisco Tom\u00e1s Morales]], fought with the patriots, led by [[Rafael Urdaneta]], to take back control over the province in the Juana de \u00c1vila Battle, and Morales brought back Spanish rule in 1822 until he was defeated at the [[Battle of Lake Maracaibo]] on 24 July 1823, culminating Venezuela's struggle for independence.\n\n=== Isolation period ===\nFor about 390 years, Maracaibo remained isolated and separated from the rest of the country. Transportation was only possible across the lake by ferry or other marine transport.\n\nCars, buses, and lorries, with their constant flow of manufactured goods and agricultural product, depended on the ferry system between the city and the eastern shore with their roads to connect to the country's motorway system. Maracaibo and the Lake Maracaibo region's economy was more linked to [[Colombia]] than to eastern Venezuela due to the natural route available through Lake Maracaibo then leading to the sea.\n\nThis isolation was both a challenge and an advantage. The very nature of the city's location made for a population known for their independent thought and character. The history of this region is rife with stories about the creation of an independent and sovereign nation apart from Venezuela, a nation called ''La Rep\u00fablica Independiente del Zulia'', which means ''The Independent Republic of Zulia'', but this has never come to be.\n\nIn January 1903, as the naval blockade of Venezuela continued during the negotiations with presidente [[Cipriano Castro]], the German warship ''[[SMS Panther]]'' attempted to enter [[Lake Maracaibo]], which was a center of German commercial activity. On 17 January, it exchanged fire with the settlement of Fort San Carlos, but withdrew after half an hour, as shallow waters prevented it getting close enough to the fort to be effective. The Venezuelans claimed this as a victory, and in response the German commander sent the ''[[SMS Vineta]]'', with heavier weapons, to set an example. On 21 January, the ''SMS Vineta'' bombarded the fort, setting fire to it and destroying it, with the death of 25 civilians in the nearby town.\n\nIn 1908, the ''Friesland'', [[HNLMS Gelderland (1898)|Gelderland]] and [[HNLMS Jacob van Heemskerck (1906)|Jacob van Heemskerck]]\nwere sent to patrol the Venezuelan coast during the ''[[Cipriano Castro|second Castro crisis]]''. ''Friesland'' guarded the entry way to Maracaibo.<ref name=\"scheepvaartmuseum.nl :: Maritieme kalender 1908\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hetscheepvaartmuseum.nl/knowledgebase/calendar%7C1908|publisher=Hetscheepvaartmuseum.nl|title=Maritieme kalender 1908|accessdate=2013-07-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Building of the bridge ===\n[[File:Monumento a la Chinita I.JPG|thumbnail|300px|Basilica of Our Lady of the Rosary of Chiquinquir\u00e1]]\nThe dictatorial regime of General [[Marcos P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez]] in the 1950s set as a goal the construction of a bridge connecting the two lake shores. Various bridge projects for the spanning of the Lake Maracaibo narrows near the city were in the works. The general's government had decided that this \"city of independent thought\" should be more \"connected\" to the rest of the country.\n\nProposals for a bridge design that included rail transport and tourist facilities were seriously considered. The fall of the P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez government on 23 January 1958, quickly led to a less elaborate design project that was approved and funded by a democratic and more conservative government.\n\nThe building of \"El Puente Sobre El Lago de Maracaibo \"General Rafael Urdaneta\"\u2014([[General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge]] over Lake Maracaibo) named after the distinguished General [[Rafael Urdaneta|hero]] of the War of Independence was opened to public traffic in 1962. The project was completed on schedule in 40 months.\n\nThis bridge construction project was a remarkable feat. Built under very difficult conditions, when completed, it became the longest prestressed concrete bridge in the world. The structure is in constant use and remains today as the most important link between Maracaibo, along with much of the state of Zulia, and the rest of Venezuela.\n[[File:Maracaibo city skyline july 2007.jpg|thumb|center|1000px|Panoramic view of Maracaibo City.]]\n\n=== Modern times ===\nMaracaibo has become a large metropolitan city, comprising two municipalities: to the north the municipality of Maracaibo and to the south the San Francisco municipality (established in 1995). In recent years, due to political/economic and cultural reasons, many have moved to Maracaibo from rural areas and other cities (including [[Caracas]]).\n[[File:Ancient office Mene Grande Oil Company.jpg|thumb|right|Former headquarters of the Mene Grande Oil Company]]\nIn the political arena, the citizens of Maracaibo (and most other cities and municipalities in Zulia state) have in recent years voted for a competitive political system in where the governor is from a certain political party and the mayor or mayors are from the opposite political party.\n\nMaracaibo also boasts one of the best universities in the country, the state university.

The following excerpts describe the local population of Maracaibo:\n\n:''They perform coasting, or long voyages, with equal facility; and when all trade is suspended by the operations of war, they enter privateers. Bred up in the neighbourhood of the lake, they are mostly all expert swimmers and excellent divers. Their reputation stands equally high as soldiers. Those who do not enter into the sea service, form plantations, or assist in cultivating those that belong to their fathers. Nothing proves better their aptitude for this kind of occupation, than the immense flocks of cattle with which the savannas of Maracaybo {{sic}} are covered.''\n\nHe also notes the appreciation of literature, the arts, education, and culture among the people of Maracaibo:\n\n:''But what confers the greatest honour on the inhabitants of Maracaibo, is their application to literature; in which, notwithstanding the wretched state of public education, they make considerable progress....They likewise acquired the art of elocution, and of writing their mother tongue with the greatest purity; in a word, they possessed all the qualities that characterise men of letters.''\n\n==Economy==\nZulia\u00b4s main income comes from oil extraction and refining, agriculture (coffee, rice, maize, cassava, cocoa, sugar cane),\nlivestock production, and mining (clay, limestone, coal and sand{{cn|date=March 2017}}).\n\n=== Medicine ===\n[[Huntington's disease]] prevalence worldwide is 5\u201310 cases per 100,000 persons.

In the past, the climate of the city, indeed all along the coast of Lake Maracaibo, was unhealthy due to the combination of high temperatures with high humidity.

Maracaibo, and the rest of Zulia, are represented in [[baseball]] by the [[\u00c1guilas del Zulia]], a Venezuelan winter league team that plays in the [[Liga Venezolana de B\u00e9isbol Profesional]], and is based in the [[Estadio Luis Aparicio El Grande]]. The city's [[basketball]] team is [[Gaiteros del Zulia]], which plays in the [[Liga Profesional de Baloncesto]] de Venezuela. Its home is the 5.000-people ''Pedro El\u00edas Belisario Aponte'' stadium. Other teams include the [[Uni\u00f3n Atl\u00e9tico Maracaibo]] and the [[Zulia FC]] in [[Football (soccer)|football]], the [[Maracaibo Rugby Football Club]] and the [[Zulianos Rugby Club]].\n\nIn the [[2000 Little League World Series]], the Sierrra Maestra Little League of Maracaibo, Venezuela defeated Bellaire Little League of Bellaire, Texas in the championship game of the 54th Little League World Series. The Coquivocoa Little League team from Maracaibo placed third in the [[1974 Little League World Series]].\n\nRugby in Venezuela was first played in Maracaibo, thanks to the influence of the English community based on the [[Zulia State]]\n\nTeam:\n* Baseball: [[\u00c1guilas del Zulia]] BBC.\n* Basketball: [[Gaiteros del Zulia]]\n* Soccer: [[Uni\u00f3n Atl\u00e9tico Maracaibo]], [[Zulia FC]]\n* Rugby: [[Maracaibo Rugby Football Club \"Oil Blacks\"]], [[Zulianos Rugby Club]]\n\n== Culture ==\n[[File:Calle Carabobo de Maracaibo.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Carabobo street contains much of the city's famous colonial architecture]]\n\nCulture in Maracaibo is very indigenous and unique, is recognized in every state and city in Venezuela, and is very influential with its [[Gaita (music style)|gaitas]], desserts, style, living, and customs. Most major houses of advertising in Venezuela acknowledge how opposite the culture of Maracaibo is from that of Caracas. Studies of both prove, for example, that Caracas' leading soft drink brand is [[Coca-Cola|Coke]], while in Maracaibo it is [[Pepsi]]. This has made many brands create special localized advertising of their products (including several Pepsi commercials spoken by local celebrities).\n\nMarabinos are extremely proud of their city, their culture, and all of Zulia. They usually claim that Venezuela wouldn't be the country it actually is without Zulia. Rivalry with inhabitants of other regions is common, specially with ''Gochos'' (people of the Trujillo, [[M\u00e9rida State|M\u00e9rida]] and T\u00e1chira state) and ''[[Caraque\u00f1o]]s'' (people of the city of [[Caracas]]).\n\nThe Gaita is a style of Venezuelan folk music from Maracaibo. According to [[Joan Corominas]], it may come from gaits, the Gothic word for \"goat\", which is the skin generally used for the membrane of the furro instrument. Other instruments used in gaita include maracas, cuatro, charrasca and tambora (Venezuelan drum). Song themes range from humorous and love songs to protest songs.The style became popular throughout Venezuela in the 1960s, and it fused with other styles such as salsa and merengue in the 1970s. Famous gaita groups include Maracaibo 15, Gran Coquivacoa, Barrio Obrero, Cardenales del \u00c9xito, Koquimba, Melody Gaita, Guaco, Estrellas del Zulia, Saladillo, and many others.\n[[File:Mural (Venezuela).JPG|thumb|1000px|center|Mural in the Libertador Avenue.]]\n\n=== Museums, cultural centers and theaters ===\n[[File:Tranv\u00eda de Maracaibo I.jpg|thumb|240px|Tram of Maracaibo.]]\n* Museo de Arte Contempor\u00e1neo del estado Zulia (MACZUL)\n* Museo [[General Rafael Urdaneta]]\n* Museo Municipal de Artes Gr\u00e1ficas \"Balmiro Le\u00f3n\"\n* Centro de Bellas Artes de Maracaibo\n* Centro de Arte de Maracaibo \"[[L\u00eda Berm\u00fadez]]\"\n* [[Baralt Theater|Teatro Baralt]]\n*Museo de la Gaita\n\n=== Libraries ===\n* [http://www.bibliotecapublicadelzulia.org.ve Biblioteca Publica del Zulia]\n* Biblioteca P\u00fablica \"Arturo Uslar Pietri\"\n* Biblioteca \"Dr. Pedro Alciro Barboza de la Torre\"\n* Biblioteca P\u00fablica \"Sim\u00f3n Palmar\"\n* [http://www.cevaz.org Biblioteca P\u00fablica \"Lu\u00eds Guillermo Pineda Belloso\" (De car\u00e1cter p\u00fablico, biling\u00fce y circulante)]\n* Biblioteca P\u00fablica Especializada \"Pedag\u00f3gica\"\n* Biblioteca P\u00fablica Especializada \"SEDINI\"\n*Biblioteca Privada \"Dr. Nectario Andrade Labarca\"\n\n== Notable natives ==\n{{Cleanup|section|date=November 2010}}\n* [[Betty Cecilia Lugo]] - Philanthropist\n* [[Teolindo Acosta]] - baseball player\n* [[Guaco|Gustavo Aguado]] - musician, singer and leader of Guaco, Venezuela's most influential music band\n* [[Ricardo Aguirre]] - composer and singer\n* [[Daniel Alvarado]] - singer and actor\n* [[Wilson \u00c1lvarez]] - Major League Baseball left-handed pitcher\n* [[Ernesto Aparicio (baseball)|Ernesto Aparicio]] - Major League Baseball baseball player, manager, and team owner\n* [[Luis Aparicio]] - former shortstop in Major League Baseball and member of the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]]\n*[[:es:Pedro Aranguren|Pedro Aranguren]]- militar\n* [[Eduardo Arcila Far\u00edas]] - journalist and historian\n* [[Rafael Maria Baralt]] - diplomat, writer, philologist, historian, first Latin American to occupy a chair at the 'Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola'\n* [[Huascar Barradas]] - flutist\n*[[Rafael Belloso Chac\u00edn]] - physician\n* [[:es:Luis Barrera Linares|Luis Barrera Linares]] - writer, academic, teacher of [[Universidad Simon Bolivar]]\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Bracho]] - baseball pitcher\n* [[Antonio Bri\u00f1ez]] - first manager to win a National Amateur Baseball championship to Venezuela\n* [[Mar\u00eda Calca\u00f1o]] - poet\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Casanova]] - baseball player and manager of the Venezuelan team that won the gold medal in 1959 Panamerican Games\n* [[Abel Castellano Jr.]] - jockey\n* [[Javier Castellano]]- jockey [[Eclipse Award]] 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016.

This was the third episode of the [[Seinfeld (season 6)|sixth season]]. It aired on October 6, 1994. The episode centers around [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|Jerry]], [[George Costanza|George]], and [[Cosmo Kramer|Kramer]]'s volunteer efforts with a [[PBS]] [[pledge drive]]. Subplots include Jerry's grandmother going on a perilous adventure through the city to deal with bounced birthday checks, [[Elaine Benes|Elaine]] committing a series of misunderstandings stemming from the high-pitched voice of her friend Noreen's boyfriend, and the start of a new trend in eating [[finger food]]s with utensils.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|Jerry]] tells [[Elaine Benes|Elaine]] that her friend Noreen was hitting on him. Elaine is skeptical, since Noreen has a boyfriend. She calls and asks about this, but the person on the end of the line identifies himself as Noreen's boyfriend Dan, who Elaine mistook for Noreen because he is a \"high-talker\" (i.e. his voice is high-pitched). This angers Dan and Noreen, particularly since Jerry's allegation is untrue. When Elaine explains her mistake to Noreen, she is dismayed that her boyfriend's voice can be so easily mistaken for a woman's, and turns her romantic interest towards Jerry.\n\nJerry agrees to help a [[public television]] fundraiser for New York [[PBS]] member station [[WNET-TV]] and [[Cosmo Kramer|Kramer]] volunteers with answering phones. The PBS representative, Kristen, sends Jerry a thank you card. While going over the fundraiser script with him, she notices the card in the trash and is offended. He tries to prove his sentimentality by showing her cards from his grandmother \"Nana\" that he has saved for years. This only offends her further, and Kramer is outraged when he sees Jerry never cashed the checks inside the cards.\n\nAt Monk's, Jerry asks [[George Costanza|George]] to bring a [[New York Yankees|Yankee]] to the pledge drive. Elaine tells them how she witnessed her boss [[Justin Pitt|Mr. Pitt]] eat a [[Snickers]] bar with a knife and fork. George sees this as a classy way of eating. When he asks the waitress about the bill, she points to it with her middle finger, leading George to think she is surreptitiously [[Finger (gesture)|giving him the finger]].\n\nWhen the rest of Yankee management opposes the idea of supporting the pledge drive on the grounds that they already give to [[WPIX|channel 11]] (WPIX-TV, which was at the time of this episode's airing, the real-life over-the-air broadcaster for Yankee games), George changes their minds by insinuating that PBS is classier than channel 11 while eating a Snickers bar with knife and fork. This starts a trend that sweeps the city and evolves to include other [[finger food]]s such as cookies and donuts.\n\nJerry cashes Nana's checks to appease Kramer; since they were written on an account that was abandoned, the account becomes overdrawn. Nana leaves home for the first time in years to go to the branch and settle matters, causing her to be presumed missing. When she calls Jerry from the bank, Elaine answers the phone and assumes it's Dan, since he has been harassing her over Noreen's obsession with Jerry. She tells Nana to drop dead and hangs up. When Dan attempts to confront Jerry about Noreen, Kramer thinks Dan is in love with Jerry. While driving Yankee [[Danny Tartabull]], George sees a driver supposedly give him the middle finger and insists on pursuing him. Catching up with him at a gas station, he finds the driver actually has his hand in a cast and splint that forces his middle finger to be extended. The delay causes Tartabull to miss the pledge drive. Nana calls the drive and Kramer persuades her to donate $1,500. [[Uncle Leo]] panics since Nana is on a [[fixed income]] and can't afford such a large gift, and runs onto the set yelling \"Stop the show!\" In light of the disasters of Tartabull's no-show and the disturbance caused by Leo, Kristin sends Jerry another greeting card, this one of a bunny giving him the finger.\n\n==Production==\nThe episode's writers [[Tom Gammill]] and [[Max Pross]] were talking one day about someone they knew in college who ate his Snickers bars with a knife and fork; [[Larry David]] encouraged them to include this in the episode.<ref name=InsLook>{{cite video |title=Seinfeld Season 6: Inside Look - \"The Pledge Drive\"|medium=DVD |publisher=[[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]]|date=2005}}</ref> Because [[Ian Abercrombie]] could not chew fast enough to finish a bite of Snickers bar between his lines of dialogue, David told him to swallow each bite whole.
