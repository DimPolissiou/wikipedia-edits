By this, Sun meant independence from imperialist domination. To achieve this he believed that China must develop a \"[[Chinese nationalism|China-nationalism]],\" ''[[Zhonghua Minzu]]'', as opposed to an \"ethnic-nationalism,\" so as to unite all of the different ethnicities of China, mainly composed by the [[Five Races Under One Union|five major groups]] of [[Han Chinese|Han]], [[Mongols in China|Mongols]], [[Tibetans]], [[Manchus]], and the [[Islam in China|Muslims]] (such as the [[Uyghurs]]), which together are symbolized by the [[Five Color Flag]] of the First Republic (1911\u20131928). This sense of nationalism is different from the idea of \"ethnocentrism,\" which equates to the same meaning of nationalism in Chinese language. To achieve this he believed that China must develop a \"national consciousness\" so as to unite the Han in the face of imperialist aggression. He argued that \"minzu\", which can be translated as \"people\", \"nationality\" or \"race\", were defined by sharing common blood, livelihood, religion, language and customs.\n\n===''M\u00ednqu\u00e1n''===\nThe Principle of M\u00ednqu\u00e1n (\u6c11\u6b0a\u4e3b\u7fa9, M\u00ednqu\u00e1n Zh\u01d4y\u00ec) is usually translated as \"[[civil rights]]\"; literally \"the People's power\" or \"government by the People.\" To Sun, it represented a Western constitutional government. He divided political life of his ideal for China into two sets of \"powers\": the power of politics and the power of governance.\n\nThe power of politics (\u653f\u6b0a, zh\u00e8ngqu\u00e1n) are the powers of the people to express their political wishes, similar to those vested in the citizenry or the parliaments in other countries, and is represented by the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]]. There are four of these powers: election (\u9078\u8209), [[recall election|recall]] (\u7f77\u514d), [[initiative]] (\u5275\u5236), and [[referendum]] (\u8907\u6c7a). These may be equated to \"[[civil rights]]\".\n\nThe power of governance (\u6cbb\u6b0a, zh\u00ecqu\u00e1n) are the powers of administration. Here he expanded the European-American constitutional theory of a [[Three powers of the State|three-branch government]] and a system of [[Separation of powers#Checks_and_balances|checks and balances]] by incorporating traditional Chinese administrative tradition to create a government of five branches (each of which is called a Yuan (\u9662, yu\u00e0n, literally \"court\"). The [[Legislative Yuan]], the [[Executive Yuan]], and the [[Judicial Yuan]] came from [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]]an thought; the [[Control Yuan]] and the [[Examination Yuan]] came from Chinese tradition. (Note that the Legislative Yuan was first intended as a branch of governance, not strictly equivalent to a national parliament.)\n\n===''M\u00ednsh\u0113ng''===\n{{main article|Socialist ideology of the Kuomintang}}\nThe Principle of M\u00ednsh\u0113ng (\u6c11\u751f\u4e3b\u7fa9, M\u00ednsh\u0113ng Zh\u01d4y\u00ec) is sometimes translated as \"the People's welfare/livelihood,\" \"Government for the People\". The concept may be understood as [[social welfare]] and as a direct criticism of the inadequacies of [[capitalism]]. He was influenced by the American thinker [[Henry George]]. Sun intended to introduce a [[Georgist]] tax reform.<ref>{{cite book|last=Trescott|first=Paul B.|title=Jingji Xue: The History of the Introduction of Western Economic Ideas Into China, 1850-1950|year=2007|publisher=Chinese University Press|pages=46\u201348|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RkJtJm9L7mQC&pg=PA48 |quote=The teachings of your single-taxer, Henry George, will be the basis of our program of reform.|isbn=9789629962425}}</ref> The [[land value tax]] in Taiwan is a legacy thereof. Sun Yat-sen said that land value tax as \"the only means of supporting the government is an infinitely just, reasonable, and equitably distributed tax, and on it we will found our new system.\"<ref>Post, Louis Freeland (April 12, 1912). \"Sun Yat Sen's Economic Program for China\". The Public. 15: 349. Retrieved 8 November 2016.</ref>\n\nHe divided livelihood into four areas: clothing, food, housing, and mobility; and planned out how an ideal (Chinese) government can take care of these for its people. Sun died before he was able to fully explain his vision of this Principle and it has been the subject of much debate within both the Chinese Nationalist and Communist Parties, with the latter suggesting that Sun supported socialism. [[Chiang Kai-shek]] further elaborated the M\u00ednsh\u0113ng principle of both the importance of social well-being and recreational activities for a modernized China in 1953 in Taiwan.<ref name=\"naer\">{{ci\u88dc\u8ff0\u3015|publisher=terms.naer.edu.tw|accessdate=2015-12-24}}</ref>\n\n==Canon==\n[[File:\u674e\u9435\u592b\u5b6b\u4e2d\u5c7112345.jpg| thumb |\"Portrait of Sun Yat-sen\" (1921) [[Li Tiefu]] Oil on Canvas 93\u00d771.7cm]]\nThe most definite (canonical) exposition of these principles was a book compiled from notes of speeches that Sun gave near [[Guangzhou]] (taken by a colleague, [[Huang Changgu]], in consultation with Sun), and therefore is open to interpretation by various parties and interest groups (see below) and may not have been as fully explicated as Sun might have wished. Indeed, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] supplied an annex to the Principle of M\u00ednsh\u0113ng, covering two additional areas of livelihood: education and leisure, and explicitly arguing that M\u00ednsh\u0113ng was not to be seen as supporting either [[communism]] or [[socialism]].\nThe French historian of Chinese history, Marie-Claire Berg\u00e8re's view is that the book is a work of propaganda. Its purpose is to appeal to action rather than to thought. As Sun Yat-sen declared, a principle is not simply an idea; it is \"a faith, a power.\"<ref>{{Cite book  | last1 = Berg\u00e8re | first1 = Marie-Claire (translated by Janet Lloyd) | title = Sun Yat-sen | year = 1994 | publisher = Stanford University Press | location = Stanford | isbn = 0-8047-3170-5 | page = 353 }}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Image:Three Principles of the People Unites China.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A sign on [[Dadan Island]] near [[Quemoy]] (Kinmen) facing [[Mainland China]] proclaiming \"Three Principles of the People Unites China\"]]\nThe Three Principles of the People were claimed as the basis for the ideologies of the Kuomintang under [[Chiang Kai-shek]], of the [[Communist Party of China]] under [[Mao Zedong]], and of the [[Reorganized National Government of China]] under Wang Jingwei. The Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China largely agreed on the meaning of [[nationalism]] but differed sharply on the meaning of democracy and people's welfare, which the former saw in Western social democratic terms and the latter interpreted in Marxist and communist terms. The Japanese collaborationist government interpreted nationalism less in terms of anti-imperialism and more in terms of cooperating with Japan to advance theoretically pan-Asian, but in practice, typically Japanese interests.\n\n===Taiwan (Republic of China)===\nThere were several [[higher education|higher-education]] institutes (university departments/faculties and [[graduate school|graduate institute]]s) in Taiwan that used to devote themselves to the 'research and development' of the Three Principles in this aspect. Since the late 1990s, these institutes have re-oriented themselves so that other political theories are also admitted as worthy of consideration, and have changed their names to be more ideologically neutral (such as Democratic Studies Institute).\n\nIn addition to this institutional phenomenon, many streets and businesses in Taiwan are named \"S\u0101n-m\u00edn\" or for one of the three principles. In contrast to other politically-derived street names, there has been no major renaming of these streets or institutions in the 1990s.\n\nAlthough the term \"Sanmin Zhuyi\" (\u4e09\u6c11\u4e3b\u7fa9) has been less explicitly invoked since the mid-1980s, no major political party has explicitly attacked its principles. The Three Principles of the People remains explicitly part of the platform of the Kuomintang and in the [[Constitution of the Republic of China]].\n\nAs for [[Taiwan independence]] supporters, some have objections regarding the formal constitutional commitment to a particular set of political principles. Also, they have been against the mandatory indoctrination in schools and universities, which have now been abolished in a piecemeal fashion beginning in the late 1990s. However, there is little fundamental hostility to the substantive principles themselves. In these circles, attitudes toward the Three Principles of the People span the spectrum from indifference to reinterpreting the Three Principles of the People [[Taiwanese localization movement|in a local Taiwanese context]] rather than in a pan-Chinese one.\n\n===Vietnam===\nThe Vietnam Revolutionary League was a union of various Vietnamese nationalist groups, run by the pro-Chinese [[Vi\u1ec7t Nam Qu\u1ed1c D\u00e2n \u0110\u1ea3ng]]. The Vi\u1ec7t Nam Qu\u1ed1c D\u00e2n \u0110\u1ea3ng translates directly into Vietnamese Kuomintang, and it was based on the Chinese Kuomintang party. Its stated goal was for unity with China under the Three Principles of the People, and opposition to Japanese and French Imperialists.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/endlesswarvietna00harr|url-access=registration|quote=Chang Fa-Kuei vnqdd.|title=The endless war: Vietnam's struggle for independence|author=James P.

Rapga stated that \"The Sanmin Zhuyi was intended for all peoples under the domination of foreigners, for all those who had been deprived of the rights of man.

The emphasis is put on the separation of the Five Powers which naturally means the separation of certain institutions from the Executive's control.\n\nThe Power of Impeachment (originally under the Control Yuan) has been expanded to include various contemporary functional government institutions. Examples include the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau, advocacy of Ombudsman Commission, Equal Opportunity Commission, Free Press and Freedom of Expression.\n\nThe Power of Examination has been adapted and modified to fit the modern concept of Selection for both political leaders as well as civil servants. This involves institutions like the Elections Department and Public Service Commission.\n\nThe People's Power Party advocates that the institutions included in these two powers, namely the Power of Impeachment and the Power of Selection, to be put under the supervision of Singapore's Elected President.<ref name=\"facebook\">{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/peoplespowerpartysg/info?tab=page_info|title=People&#039;s Power Party - PPP|publisher=facebook.com|accessdate=2015-12-24}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[National Revolutionary Army]]\n* [[Whampoa Military Academy]]\n* [[History of the Republic of China]]\n* [[Politics of the Republic of China]]\n* [[The Six Arrows]]\n* [[Pancasila (politics)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*[[Sun Yat-sen]], translated by Pasquale d'Elia.''The Triple Demism of Sun Yat-Sen''.

To achieve this he believed that China must develop a \"[[Chinese nationalism|China-nationalism]],\" ''[[Zhonghua Minzu]]'', as opposed to an \"ethnic-nationalism,\" so as to unite all of the different ethnicities of China, mainly composed by the [[Five Races Under One Union|five major groups]] of [[Han Chinese|Han]], [[Mongols in China|Mongols]], [[Tibetans]], [[Manchus]], and the [[Islam in China|Muslims]] (such as the [[Uyghurs]]), which together are symbolized by the [[Five Color Flag]] of the First Republic (1911\u20131928). This sense of nationalism is different from the idea of \"ethnocentrism,\" which equates to the same meaning of nationalism in Chinese language. To achieve this he believed that China must develop a \"national consciousness\" so as to unite the Han in the face of imperialist aggression. He argued that \"minzu\", which can be translated as \"people\", \"nationality\" or \"race\", were defined by sharing common blood, livelihood, religion, language and customs.\n\n===''M\u00ednqu\u00e1n''===\nThe Principle of M\u00ednqu\u00e1n (\u6c11\u6b0a\u4e3b\u7fa9, M\u00ednqu\u00e1n Zh\u01d4y\u00ec) is usually translated as \"[[civil rights]]\"; literally \"the People's power\" or \"government by the People.\" To Sun, it represented a Western constitutional government. He divided political life of his ideal for China into two sets of \"powers\": the power of politics and the power of governance.\n\nThe power of politics (\u653f\u6b0a, zh\u00e8ngqu\u00e1n) are the powers of the people to express their political wishes, similar to those vested in the citizenry or the parliaments in other countries, and is represented by the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]]. There are four of these powers: election (\u9078\u8209), [[recall election|recall]] (\u7f77\u514d), [[initiative]] (\u5275\u5236), and [[referendum]] (\u8907\u6c7a). These may be equated to \"[[civil rights]]\".\n\nThe power of governance (\u6cbb\u6b0a, zh\u00ecqu\u00e1n) are the powers of administration. Here he expanded the European-American constitutional theory of a [[Three powers of the State|three-branch government]] and a system of [[Separation of powers#Checks_and_balances|checks and balances]] by incorporating traditional Chinese administrative tradition to create a government of five branches (each of which is called a Yuan (\u9662, yu\u00e0n, literally \"court\"). The [[Legislative Yuan]], the [[Executive Yuan]], and the [[Judicial Yuan]] came from [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]]an thought; the [[Control Yuan]] and the [[Examination Yuan]] came from Chinese tradition. (Note that the Legislative Yuan was first intended as a branch of governance, not strictly equivalent to a national parliament.)\n\n===''M\u00ednsh\u0113ng''===\n{{main article|Socialist ideology of the Kuomintang}}\nThe Principle of M\u00ednsh\u0113ng (\u6c11\u751f\u4e3b\u7fa9, M\u00ednsh\u0113ng Zh\u01d4y\u00ec) is sometimes translated as \"the People's welfare/livelihood,\" \"Government for the People\". The concept may be understood as [[social welfare]] and as a direct criticism of the inadequacies of [[capitalism]]. He was influenced by the American thinker [[Henry George]]. Sun intended to introduce a [[Georgist]] tax reform.<ref>{{cite book|last=Trescott|first=Paul B.|title=Jingji Xue: The History of the Introduction of Western Economic Ideas Into China, 1850-1950|year=2007|publisher=Chinese University Press|pages=46\u201348|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RkJtJm9L7mQC&pg=PA48 |quote=The teachings of your single-taxer, Henry George, will be the basis of our program of reform.|isbn=9789629962425}}</ref> The [[land value tax]] in Taiwan is a legacy thereof. Sun Yat-sen said that land value tax as \"the only means of supporting the government is an infinitely just, reasonable, and equitably distributed tax, and on it we will found our new system.\"<ref>Post, Louis Freeland (April 12, 1912). \"Sun Yat Sen's Economic Program for China\". The Public. 15: 349. Retrieved 8 November 2016.</ref>\n\nHe divided livelihood into four areas: clothing, food, housing, and mobility; and planned out how an ideal (Chinese) government can take care of these for its people. Sun died before he was able to fully explain his vision of this Principle and it has been the subject of much debate within both the Chinese Nationalist and Communist Parties, with the latter suggesting that Sun supported socialism. [[Chiang Kai-shek]] further elaborated the M\u00ednsh\u0113ng principle of both the importance of social well-being and recreational activities for a modernized China in 1953 in Taiwan.<ref name=\"naer\">{{ci\u88dc\u8ff0\u3015|publisher=terms.naer.edu.tw|accessdate=2015-12-24}}</ref>\n\n==Canon==\n[[File:\u674e\u9435\u592b\u5b6b\u4e2d\u5c7112345.jpg| thumb |\"Portrait of Sun Yat-sen\" (1921) [[Li Tiefu]] Oil on Canvas 93\u00d771.7cm]]\nThe most definite (canonical) exposition of these principles was a book compiled from notes of speeches that Sun gave near [[Guangzhou]] (taken by a colleague, [[Huang Changgu]], in consultation with Sun), and therefore is open to interpretation by various parties and interest groups (see below) and may not have been as fully explicated as Sun might have wished. Indeed, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] supplied an annex to the Principle of M\u00ednsh\u0113ng, covering two additional areas of livelihood: education and leisure, and explicitly arguing that M\u00ednsh\u0113ng was not to be seen as supporting either [[communism]] or [[socialism]].\nThe French historian of Chinese history, Marie-Claire Berg\u00e8re's view is that the book is a work of propaganda. Its purpose is to appeal to action rather than to thought. As Sun Yat-sen declared, a principle is not simply an idea; it is \"a faith, a power.\"<ref>{{Cite book  | last1 = Berg\u00e8re | first1 = Marie-Claire (translated by Janet Lloyd) | title = Sun Yat-sen | year = 1994 | publisher = Stanford University Press | location = Stanford | isbn = 0-8047-3170-5 | page = 353 }}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Image:Three Principles of the People Unites China.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A sign on [[Dadan Island]] near [[Quemoy]] (Kinmen) facing [[Mainland China]] proclaiming \"Three Principles of the People Unites China\"]]\nThe Three Principles of the People were claimed as the basis for the ideologies of the Kuomintang under [[Chiang Kai-shek]], of the [[Communist Party of China]] under [[Mao Zedong]], and of the [[Reorganized National Government of China]] under Wang Jingwei. The Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China largely agreed on the meaning of [[nationalism]] but differed sharply on the meaning of democracy and people's welfare, which the former saw in Western social democratic terms and the latter interpreted in Marxist and communist terms. The Japanese collaborationist government interpreted nationalism less in terms of anti-imperialism and more in terms of cooperating with Japan to advance theoretically pan-Asian, but in practice, typically Japanese interests.\n\n===Taiwan (Republic of China)===\nThere were several [[higher education|higher-education]] institutes (university departments/faculties and [[graduate school|graduate institute]]s) in Taiwan that used to devote themselves to the 'research and development' of the Three Principles in this aspect. Since the late 1990s, these institutes have re-oriented themselves so that other political theories are also admitted as worthy of consideration, and have changed their names to be more ideologically neutral (such as Democratic Studies Institute).\n\nIn addition to this institutional phenomenon, many streets and businesses in Taiwan are named \"S\u0101n-m\u00edn\" or for one of the three principles. In contrast to other politically-derived street names, there has been no major renaming of these streets or institutions in the 1990s.\n\nAlthough the term \"Sanmin Zhuyi\" (\u4e09\u6c11\u4e3b\u7fa9) has been less explicitly invoked since the mid-1980s, no major political party has explicitly attacked its principles. The Three Principles of the People remains explicitly part of the platform of the Kuomintang and in the [[Constitution of the Republic of China]].\n\nAs for [[Taiwan independence]] supporters, some have objections regarding the formal constitutional commitment to a particular set of political principles. Also, they have been against the mandatory indoctrination in schools and universities, which have now been abolished in a piecemeal fashion beginning in the late 1990s. However, there is little fundamental hostility to the substantive principles themselves. In these circles, attitudes toward the Three Principles of the People span the spectrum from indifference to reinterpreting the Three Principles of the People [[Taiwanese localization movement|in a local Taiwanese context]] rather than in a pan-Chinese one.\n\n===Vietnam===\nThe Vietnam Revolutionary League was a union of various Vietnamese nationalist groups, run by the pro-Chinese [[Vi\u1ec7t Nam Qu\u1ed1c D\u00e2n \u0110\u1ea3ng]]. The Vi\u1ec7t Nam Qu\u1ed1c D\u00e2n \u0110\u1ea3ng translates directly into Vietnamese Kuomintang, and it was based on the Chinese Kuomintang party. Its stated goal was for unity with China under the Three Principles of the People, and opposition to Japanese and French Imperialists.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/endlesswarvietna00harr|url-access=registration|quote=Chang Fa-Kuei vnqdd.|title=The endless war: Vietnam's struggle for independence|author=James P.

Rapga stated that \"The Sanmin Zhuyi was intended for all peoples under the domination of foreigners, for all those who had been deprived of the rights of man.

The emphasis is put on the separation of the Five Powers which naturally means the separation of certain institutions from the Executive's control.\n\nThe Power of Impeachment (originally under the Control Yuan) has been expanded to include various contemporary functional government institutions. Examples include the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau, advocacy of Ombudsman Commission, Equal Opportunity Commission, Free Press and Freedom of Expression.\n\nThe Power of Examination has been adapted and modified to fit the modern concept of Selection for both political leaders as well as civil servants. This involves institutions like the Elections Department and Public Service Commission.\n\nThe People's Power Party advocates that the institutions included in these two powers, namely the Power of Impeachment and the Power of Selection, to be put under the supervision of Singapore's Elected President.<ref name=\"facebook\">{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/peoplespowerpartysg/info?tab=page_info|title=People&#039;s Power Party - PPP|publisher=facebook.com|accessdate=2015-12-24}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[National Revolutionary Army]]\n* [[Whampoa Military Academy]]\n* [[History of the Republic of China]]\n* [[Politics of the Republic of China]]\n* [[The Six Arrows]]\n* [[Pancasila (politics)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*[[Sun Yat-sen]], translated by Pasquale d'Elia.''The Triple Demism of Sun Yat-Sen''.
