It is one of two active [[Fleet Air Arm]] bases (the other being [[RNAS Culdrose (HMS Seahawk)|RNAS Culdrose)]] and is currently home to the Royal Navy [[AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat|Wildcat HMA2]] and [[Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)|Army Air Corps]] [[AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat|Wildcat AH1]] helicopters as well as the Royal Navy's [[Commando Helicopter Force]] [[AgustaWestland AW101|Merlin]] HCi3/3A/4 and [[AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat|Wildcat AH1]] helicopters.\n\nThe site consists of {{convert|1000|acre|sqmi km2|1|abbr=on}} of airfield sites plus ranges and minor estates. Royal Naval Air Station (RNAS) Yeovilton is a large multi-role air station with an annual budget of some \u00a361 million. The airfield is also home to the [[Fleet Air Arm Museum]] and the station hosts an annual Air Day in July.\n\n==History==\n\nIn 1938, the potential of the land at Yeovilton for use as an airfield was spotted by [[Westland Aircraft]]'s chief test pilot [[Harald Penrose]] and an offer was made to buy the land. The owners, however{{spaced ndash}}the [[Ecclesiastical Commissioners]] of the [[Church of England]]{{spaced ndash}}refused to sell it. In 1939, the Admiralty Air Division commandeered {{convert|417|acre|ha}} of the land and work began on the construction of the site. The runways being completed in 1941 despite problems with poor drainage. A main runway of {{convert|3645|ft|abbr=on|0}} and three subsidiary runways each of {{convert|3000|ft|abbr=on|0}} had been constructed.<ref name=\"berryman\">{{cite book |title=Somerset airfields in the Second World War |last=Berryman |first=David |year=2006 |publisher=Countryside Books |location=Newbury |isbn=1-85306-864-0 |pages=194\u2013219 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ground Crew Working on Fleet Air Arm Aircraft at Rnas Yeovilton, September 1943 TR1275.jpg|thumb|A Fleet Air Arm Supermarine Seafire being refuelled by a petrol bowser at Yeovilton in September 1943.|alt=A Fleet Air Arm Supermarine Seafire being refuelled by a petrol bowser at Yeovilton in September 1943.|left]]\n[[750 Naval Air Squadron]] was formed at [[RNAS Ford]] on 24 May 1939 from the Royal Navy Observer School, but after Ford was bombed early in the war, it moved to RNAS Yeovilton.<ref name=NN>{{cite web|url=http://www.navynews.co.uk/articles/2002/0202/0002022601.asp|title=50 Years Not Out for 750 Squadron|publisher=[[Navy News]]|accessdate=6 February 2010}}</ref> They were joined by [[751 Naval Air Squadron|751]] and [[752 Naval Air Squadron|752]] Squadrons with the Naval Air Fighter School soon following. In addition Westland Aircraft developed a repair facility at the site.  From July 1940, the site was subjected to [[Luftwaffe]] bombing on several occasions. [[794 Naval Air Squadron]] was the first to be formed at the base and served to train other squadrons to practise aerial gunnery, and part of one of the runways was marked up as a flight deck to practise landing on an aircraft carrier. [[827 Naval Air Squadron]] was also stationed at Yeovilton operating [[Fairey Albacore]]s and later [[Fairey Barracuda|Barracuda]]s starting in May 1943, becoming the first squadron to receive Barracudas in any substantial number.<ref name=\"berryman\"/> Several units which were preparing for embarkation were also stationed at the site during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Because of pressure on space at the airfield, satellite sites were set up at [[RNAS Charlton Horethorne (HMS Heron II)|Charlton Horethorne]] and [[Henstridge Airfield|Henstridge]] in 1942. A centre for Air Direction Radar was also established at Speckington Manor on the edge of the airfield.<ref name=\"berryman\"/>\n\nAfter the end of the war, Yeovilton became one of the main demobilization centres for the Royal Navy, with many of the men helping to refurbish the runways while they stayed at the base. In 1952, Yeovilton became the shore base for the fleets all-weather fighters. The runways were further extended by [[Taylor Woodrow]] in 1952 and 1957 to cope with jet aircraft. In May 1953, it became the headquarters of Flag Officer Flying Training.<ref name=\"helis\">{{cite web |url=http://www.helis.com/database/?menu=2&tpais=UK&tbase=27&titulo=UK%20RNAS%20Yeovilton |title=RNAS Yeovilton |accessdate=20 February 2008 |work=Helis.com }}</ref>\n\n[[File:899 Shar Yeovilton.jpg|thumb|[[British Aerospace Sea Harrier|BAe Sea Harrier FRS1]] of 899 Naval Air Squadron at Yeovilton Naval Air Station in 1982.]]\nDuring the 1960s, further development work was undertaken, with the School of Fighter Direction returning to the site and the [[De Havilland Venom|Sea Venoms]] being replaced by the [[de Havilland Sea Vixen]]s then in turn by the [[McDonnell-Douglas]] [[F-4 Phantom II|Phantom FG1]] as a carrier-borne fighter. The 1970s saw the Flag Officer, Naval Air Command (FONAC), transferring from [[RNAS Lee-on-Solent (HMS Daedalus)|RNAS Lee-on-Solent]]. Royal Navy fixed wing operations were phased out, and the [[F-4 Phantom II|Phantoms]] transferred to the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]]. The base remained as the home of the Commando Helicopter Squadrons, using the [[Westland Wessex|Wessex]] HU5 and later the [[Westland Sea King|Sea King]] HC4, and the fixed wing [[Fleet Requirements and Aircraft Direction Unit]] (FRADU) and became the main shore base for the Navy's fleet of [[Sea Harrier]] FRS1 (and later, FA2).

As a result, The Welbeck Estate Group acquired in the nearby town of Ilchester two entire estates of apartments in Hermes Place and Lyster Close that were used by personnel at HMS Heron.

It is one of two active [[Fleet Air Arm]] bases (the other being [[RNAS Culdrose (HMS Seahawk)|RNAS Culdrose)]] and is currently home to the Royal Navy [[AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat|Wildcat HMA2]] and [[Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)|Army Air Corps]] [[AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat|Wildcat AH1]] helicopters as well as the Royal Navy's [[Commando Helicopter Force]] [[AgustaWestland AW101|Merlin]] HCi3/3A/4 and [[AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat|Wildcat AH1]] helicopters.\n\nThe site consists of {{convert|1000|acre|sqmi km2|1|abbr=on}} of airfield sites plus ranges and minor estates. Royal Naval Air Station (RNAS) Yeovilton is a large multi-role air station with an annual budget of some \u00a361 million. The airfield is also home to the [[Fleet Air Arm Museum]] and the station hosts an annual Air Day in July.\n\n==History==\n\nIn 1938, the potential of the land at Yeovilton for use as an airfield was spotted by [[Westland Aircraft]]'s chief test pilot [[Harald Penrose]] and an offer was made to buy the land. The owners, however{{spaced ndash}}the [[Ecclesiastical Commissioners]] of the [[Church of England]]{{spaced ndash}}refused to sell it. In 1939, the Admiralty Air Division commandeered {{convert|417|acre|ha}} of the land and work began on the construction of the site. The runways being completed in 1941 despite problems with poor drainage. A main runway of {{convert|3645|ft|abbr=on|0}} and three subsidiary runways each of {{convert|3000|ft|abbr=on|0}} had been constructed.<ref name=\"berryman\">{{cite book |title=Somerset airfields in the Second World War |last=Berryman |first=David |year=2006 |publisher=Countryside Books |location=Newbury |isbn=1-85306-864-0 |pages=194\u2013219 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ground Crew Working on Fleet Air Arm Aircraft at Rnas Yeovilton, September 1943 TR1275.jpg|thumb|A Fleet Air Arm Supermarine Seafire being refuelled by a petrol bowser at Yeovilton in September 1943.|alt=A Fleet Air Arm Supermarine Seafire being refuelled by a petrol bowser at Yeovilton in September 1943.|left]]\n[[750 Naval Air Squadron]] was formed at [[RNAS Ford]] on 24 May 1939 from the Royal Navy Observer School, but after Ford was bombed early in the war, it moved to RNAS Yeovilton.<ref name=NN>{{cite web|url=http://www.navynews.co.uk/articles/2002/0202/0002022601.asp|title=50 Years Not Out for 750 Squadron|publisher=[[Navy News]]|accessdate=6 February 2010}}</ref> They were joined by [[751 Naval Air Squadron|751]] and [[752 Naval Air Squadron|752]] Squadrons with the Naval Air Fighter School soon following. In addition Westland Aircraft developed a repair facility at the site.  From July 1940, the site was subjected to [[Luftwaffe]] bombing on several occasions. [[794 Naval Air Squadron]] was the first to be formed at the base and served to train other squadrons to practise aerial gunnery, and part of one of the runways was marked up as a flight deck to practise landing on an aircraft carrier. [[827 Naval Air Squadron]] was also stationed at Yeovilton operating [[Fairey Albacore]]s and later [[Fairey Barracuda|Barracuda]]s starting in May 1943, becoming the first squadron to receive Barracudas in any substantial number.<ref name=\"berryman\"/> Several units which were preparing for embarkation were also stationed at the site during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Because of pressure on space at the airfield, satellite sites were set up at [[RNAS Charlton Horethorne (HMS Heron II)|Charlton Horethorne]] and [[Henstridge Airfield|Henstridge]] in 1942. A centre for Air Direction Radar was also established at Speckington Manor on the edge of the airfield.<ref name=\"berryman\"/>\n\nAfter the end of the war, Yeovilton became one of the main demobilization centres for the Royal Navy, with many of the men helping to refurbish the runways while they stayed at the base. In 1952, Yeovilton became the shore base for the fleets all-weather fighters. The runways were further extended by [[Taylor Woodrow]] in 1952 and 1957 to cope with jet aircraft. In May 1953, it became the headquarters of Flag Officer Flying Training.<ref name=\"helis\">{{cite web |url=http://www.helis.com/database/?menu=2&tpais=UK&tbase=27&titulo=UK%20RNAS%20Yeovilton |title=RNAS Yeovilton |accessdate=20 February 2008 |work=Helis.com }}</ref>\n\n[[File:899 Shar Yeovilton.jpg|thumb|[[British Aerospace Sea Harrier|BAe Sea Harrier FRS1]] of 899 Naval Air Squadron at Yeovilton Naval Air Station in 1982.]]\nDuring the 1960s, further development work was undertaken, with the School of Fighter Direction returning to the site and the [[De Havilland Venom|Sea Venoms]] being replaced by the [[de Havilland Sea Vixen]]s then in turn by the [[McDonnell-Douglas]] [[F-4 Phantom II|Phantom FG1]] as a carrier-borne fighter.

The base remained as the home of the Commando Helicopter Squadrons, using the [[Westland Wessex|Wessex]] HU5 and later the [[Westland Sea King|Sea King]] HC4, and the fixed wing [[Fleet Requirements and Aircraft Direction Unit]] (FRADU) and became the main shore base for the Navy's fleet of [[Sea Harrier]] FRS1 (and later, FA2).

As a result, The Welbeck Estate Group acquired in the nearby town of Ilchester two entire estates of apartments in Hermes Place and Lyster Close that were used by personnel at HMS Heron.

Both injuries crippled him for life. Some believe that Timur suffered his crippling injuries while serving as a mercenary to the khan of [[Sistan]] in [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]] in what is today the [[Dashti Margo]] in southwest [[Afghanistan]].

This was the second military expedition that he led, and its success led to further operations, among them the subjugation of [[Khwarezm]] and [[Urgench]].\n\nFollowing Qazaghan's murder, disputes arose among the many claimants to [[sovereign]] power. [[Tughlugh Timur]] of [[Kashgar]], the Khan of the Eastern Chagatai Khanate, another descendant of Genghis Khan, invaded, interrupting this infighting. Timur was sent to negotiate with the invader but joined with him instead and was rewarded with Transoxania. At about this time, his father died and Timur also became chief of the Berlas. Tughlugh then attempted to set his son [[Ilyas Khoja]] over Transoxania, but Timur repelled this invasion with a smaller force.<ref name=hannah />\n\n== Rise to power ==\n[[File:Timur during attack on Balkh 1370.jpg|thumb|Timur commanding the [[Siege of Balkh (1370)|Siege of Balkh]]]]\n\nIt was in this period that Timur reduced the [[Chagatai Khanate|Chagatai khans]] to the position of [[figurehead]]s while he ruled in their name. Also during this period, Timur and his brother-in-law Amir Husayn, who were at first fellow fugitives and wanderers in joint adventures, became rivals and antagonists. The relationship between them began to become strained after Husayn abandoned efforts to carry out Timur's orders to finish off Ilya Khoja (former governor of Mawarannah) close to Tishnet.<ref name=\"marozzi-2004\" />{{rp|40}}\n\nTimur began to gain a following of people in Balkh, consisting of merchants, fellow tribesmen, Muslim clergy, aristocracy and agricultural workers, because of his kindness in sharing his belongings with them. This contrasted Timur's behavior with that of Husayn, who alienated these people, took many possessions from them via his heavy tax laws and selfishly spent the tax money building elaborate structures.<ref name=\"marozzi-2004\" />{{rp|41\u20132}} Around 1370, Husayn surrendered to Timur and was later assassinated, which allowed Timur to be formally proclaimed sovereign at [[Balkh]]. He married Husayn's wife [[Saray Mulk Khanum]], a descendant of Genghis Khan, allowing him to become imperial ruler of the Chaghatay tribe.<ref name=\"marozzi-2004\" />\n\n== Legitimization of Timur's rule ==\n[[File:TimuridEmpire1400.png|thumb|300px|The extent of the [[Timurid Empire]]]]\n\nTimur's Turco-Mongolian heritage provided opportunities and challenges as he sought to rule the Mongol Empire and the Muslim world. According to the Mongol traditions, Timur could not claim the title of ''khan'' or rule the Mongol Empire because he was not a descendant of [[Genghis Khan]]. Therefore, Timur set up a puppet [[Chagatai Khan|Chaghatay Khan]], [[Suurgatmish|Suyurghatmish]], as the nominal ruler of Balkh as he pretended to act as a \"protector of the member of a Chinggisid line, that of Genghis Khan's eldest son, [[Jochi]]\".<ref name=\"manz-2002-3\">{{cite journal|last=Manz|first=Beatrice Forbes|title=Tamerlane's Career and Its Uses|journal=Journal of World History|year=2002|volume=13|page=3|doi=10.1353/jwh.2002.0017}}</ref> Timur instead used the title of [[Amir]] meaning general, and acting in the name of the [[Chagatai Khanate|Chagatai]] ruler of Transoxania.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|106}} To reinforce this position, Timur claimed the title Guregen (royal son-in-law) when he married [[Saray Mulk Khanum]], a princess of Chinggisid descent.<ref name=\":1\" />{{Rp|14}}\n\nAs with the title of Khan, Timur similarly could not claim the supreme title of the Islamic world, [[Caliph]], because the \"office was limited to the [[Quraysh]], the tribe of the [[Prophet Muhammad]]\". Therefore, Timur reacted to the challenge by creating a myth and image of himself as a \"supernatural personal power\" ordained by God.<ref name=\"manz-2002-3\" /> Otherwise he was described as a spiritual descendant of Ali, thus taken lineage of both to Genghis Khan and the Quraysh.<ref>Denise Aigle ''The Mongol Empire between Myth and Reality: Studies in Anthropological History'' BRILL, 28 October 2014 p. 132</ref>\n\n== Period of expansion ==\nTimur spent the next 35 years in various [[List of wars|wars]] and expeditions. He not only consolidated his rule at home by the subjugation of his foes, but sought extension of territory by encroachments upon the lands of foreign potentates. His conquests to the west and northwest led him to the lands near the [[Caspian Sea]] and to the banks of the [[Ural River|Ural]] and the [[Volga]]. Conquests in the south and south-West encompassed almost every province in [[Persia]], including [[Baghdad]], [[Karbala]] and Northern Iraq.\n\nOne of the most formidable of Timur's opponents was another Mongol ruler, a descendant of Genghis Khan named [[Tokhtamysh]]. After having been a refugee in Timur's court, Tokhtamysh became ruler both of the eastern [[White Horde|Kipchak]] and the [[Golden Horde]]. After his accession, he quarreled with Timur over the possession of [[Khiva|Khwarizm]] and [[Azerbaijan]]. However, Timur still supported him against the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Russians]] and in 1382 Tokhtamysh invaded the Muscovite dominion and [[Siege of Moscow (1382)|burned Moscow]].<ref>Nicholas V. Raisanovsky; Mark D. Steinberg: ''A History of Russia'' Seventh Edition, pg 93</ref>\n\n[[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] tradition states that later, in 1395 Timur, having reached the frontier of [[Principality of Ryazan]], had taken [[Elets]] and started advancing towards Moscow. Great Prince [[Vasily I of Moscow]] went with an army to [[Kolomna]] and halted at the banks of the [[Oka River]]. The clergy brought the famed [[Theotokos of Vladimir]] icon from [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] to Moscow. Along the way people prayed kneeling: \u201cO Mother of God, save the land of Russia!\u201d Suddenly, Timur's armies retreated. In memory of this miraculous deliverance of the Russian land from Timur on 26 August, the all-Russian celebration in honor of the Meeting of the Vladimir Icon of the Most Holy Mother of God was established.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://oca.org/saints/lives/2016/08/26/102402-commemoration-of-the-vladimir-icon-of-the-mother-of-god-and-the|title=Commemoration of the Vladimir Icon of the Mother of God and the deliverance of Moscow from the Invasion of Tamerlane|website=oca.org|accessdate=5 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Conquest of Persia ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2019}}\n[[File:Tamerlane Besieging Urganj.JPG|thumb|Timur besieges the historic city of [[Urganj]].]]\n[[File:Timur orders campaign against Georgia.jpg|thumb|Timur orders [[Timur's invasions of Georgia|campaign]] against [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].]]\n[[File:Timur's army attacks Nerges, Georgia.jpg|thumb|Emir Timur's army attacks the survivors of the town of Nerges, in Georgia, in the spring of 1396.]]\n\nAfter the death of [[Abu Sa'id (Ilkhanid dynasty)|Abu Sa'id]], ruler of the [[Ilkhanate]], in 1335, there was a power vacuum in Persia. In the end, Persia was split amongst the [[Muzaffarids (Iran)|Muzaffarids]], [[Kartids]], [[Eretnids]], [[Chobanids]], [[Injuids]], [[Jalayirids]], and [[Sarbadars]]. In 1383, Timur started his lengthy military conquest of Persia, though he already ruled over much of Persian [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] by 1381, after Khwaja Mas'ud, of the [[Sarbadar]] dynasty surrendered. Timur began his Persian campaign with [[Herat]], capital of the [[Kurt dynasty|Kartid dynasty]]. When Herat did not surrender he reduced the city to rubble and massacred most of its citizens; it remained in ruins until [[Shah Rukh]] ordered its reconstruction.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=96ec98LieGsC&pg=PA39&lpg=PA39&dq=siege+of+herat+timur#v=onepage&q=siege%20of%20herat%20timur&f=false|title=Mughal Gardens|work=google.ca|isbn=9780884022350|last1=Wescoat|first1=James L.|last2=Wolschke-Bulmahn|first2=Joachim|year=1996}}</ref> Timur then sent a General to capture rebellious [[Kandahar]]. With the capture of Herat the Kartid kingdom surrendered and became vassals of Timur; it would later be annexed outright less than a decade later in 1389 by Timur's son [[Miran Shah]].\n\nTimur then headed west to capture the [[Zagros Mountains]], passing through [[Mazandaran]]. During his travel through the north of Persia, he captured the then town of [[Tehran]], which surrendered and was thus treated mercifully. He laid siege to [[Soltaniyeh]] in 1384. [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] revolted one year later, so Timur destroyed Isfizar, and the prisoners were cemented into the walls alive. The next year the kingdom of Sistan, under the [[Mihrabanids|Mihrabanid dynasty]], was ravaged, and its capital at [[Zaranj]] was destroyed. Timur then returned to his capital of [[Samarkand]], where he began planning for his [[Timur's invasion of Georgia|Georgian campaign]] and [[Tokhtamysh\u2013Timur war|Golden Horde]] invasion. In 1386, Timur passed through [[Mazandaran]] as he had when trying to capture the Zagros. He went near the city of [[Soltaniyeh]], which he had previously captured but instead turned north and captured [[Tabriz]] with little resistance, along with [[Maragha]]. He ordered heavy taxation of the people, which was collected by Adil Aqa, who was also given control over Soltaniyeh. Adil was later executed because Timur suspected him of corruption.\n\nTimur then went north to begin his Georgian and Golden Horde campaigns, pausing his full-scale invasion of Persia. When he returned, he found his generals had done well in protecting the cities and lands he had conquered in Persia. Though many rebelled, and his son [[Miran Shah]], who may have been [[regent]], was forced to annex rebellious vassal dynasties, his holdings remained. So he proceeded to capture the rest of Persia, specifically the two major southern cities of [[Isfahan]] and [[Shiraz]]. When he arrived with his army at [[Isfahan]] in 1387, the city [[Siege of Isfahan (1387)|immediately surrendered]]; he treated it with relative mercy as he normally did with cities that surrendered (unlike Herat). However, after Isfahan revolted against Timur's taxes by killing the tax collectors and some of Timur's soldiers, he ordered the massacre of the city's citizens; the death toll is reckoned at between 100,000 and 200,000.<ref name=\"Chaliand 2007 87\">{{cite book|last=Chaliand|first=Gerard|title=The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to Al Qaeda|year=2007|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-24709-3|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofterrori00grar|url-access=registration|quote=isfahan Timur.|author2=Arnaud Blin |page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofterrori00grar/page/87 87]}}</ref> An eye-witness counted more than 28 towers constructed of about 1,500 heads each.<ref>Fisher, W.B.; Jackson, P.; Lockhart, L.; Boyle, J.A. : The Cambridge History of Iran, p55.</ref> This has been described as a \"systematic use of terror against towns...an integral element of Tamerlane's strategic element\", which he viewed as preventing bloodshed by discouraging resistance. His massacres were selective and he spared the artistic and educated.<ref name=\"Chaliand 2007 87\" /> This would later influence the next great Persian conqueror: [[Nader Shah]].\n\nTimur then began a five-year campaign to the west in 1392, attacking [[Iranian Kurdistan|Persian Kurdistan]]. In 1393, Shiraz was captured after surrendering, and the Muzaffarids became vassals of Timur, though prince [[Shah Mansur (Persia)|Shah Mansur]] rebelled but was defeated, and the [[Muzafarids]] were annexed. Shortly after Georgia was devastated so that the Golden Horde could not use it to threaten northern Iran. In the same year, Timur caught Baghdad by surprise in August by marching there in only eight days from Shiraz. Sultan [[Ahmad Jalayir]] fled to Syria, where the Mamluk Sultan [[Barquq]] protected him and killed Timur's envoys. Timur left the [[Sarbadar]] prince Khwaja Mas'ud to govern [[Baghdad]], but he was driven out when [[Ahmad Jalayir]] returned. Ahmad was unpopular but got some dangerous help from [[Qara Yusuf]] of the [[Kara Koyunlu]]; he fled again in 1399, this time to the Ottomans.\n\n=== Tokhtamysh\u2013Timur war ===\nIn the meantime, Tokhtamysh, now khan of the [[Golden Horde]], turned against his patron and in 1385 invaded [[Azerbaijan]]. The inevitable response by Timur resulted in the [[Tokhtamysh\u2013Timur war]]. In the initial stage of the war, Timur won a victory at the [[Battle of the Kondurcha River]]. After the battle Tokhtamysh and some of his army were allowed to escape. After Tokhtamysh's initial defeat, Timur invaded Muscovy to the north of Tokhtamysh's holdings. Timur's army burned [[Ryazan]] and advanced on Moscow. He was pulled away before reaching the Oka River by Tokhtamysh's renewed campaign in the south.<ref>Nicholas V. Raisanovsky; Mark D. Steinberg: ''A History of Russia'' Seventh Edition, pg 94</ref>\n\nIn the first phase of the conflict with Tokhtamysh, Timur led an army of over 100,000 men north for more than 700 miles into the steppe. He then rode west about 1,000 miles advancing in a front more than 10 miles wide. During this advance, Timur's army got far enough north to be in a region of [[midnight sun|very long summer days]] causing complaints by his Muslim soldiers about keeping a long schedule of [[salat|prayers]]. It was then that Tokhtamysh's army was boxed in against the east bank of the Volga River in the [[Orenburg]] region and destroyed at the [[Battle of the Kondurcha River]], in 1391.\n\nIn the second phase of the conflict, Timur took a different route against the enemy by invading the realm of Tokhtamysh via the [[Caucasus]] region. In 1395, Timur defeated Tokhtamysh in the [[Battle of the Terek River]], concluding the struggle between the two monarchs. Tokhtamysh was unable to restore his power or prestige, and he was killed about a decade later in the area of present-day [[Tyumen]]. During the course of Timur's campaigns, his army destroyed [[Sarai (city)|Sarai]], the capital of the Golden Horde, and [[Astrakhan]], subsequently disrupting the Golden Horde's [[Silk Road]]. The Golden Horde no longer held power after their losses to Timur.\n\n=== Ismailis ===\nIn May 1393, Timur's army invaded the [[Anjudan]], crippling the [[Ismaili]] village only a year after his assault on the Ismailis in [[Mazandaran]]. The village was prepared for the attack, evidenced by its fortress and system of tunnels. Undeterred, Timur's soldiers flooded the tunnels by cutting into a channel overhead. Timur's reasons for attacking this village are not yet well understood. However, it has been suggested that his [[Timur#Personal life|religious persuasions]] and view of himself as an [[Timur#Indian campaign|executor of divine will]] may have contributed to his motivations.<ref name=\"Virani, Shafique N 2007, p. 116\">Virani, Shafique N.

His invasion did not go unopposed and he encountered resistance from the Governor of [[Meerut]] during the march to Delhi. Timur was still able to continue his approach to Delhi, arriving in 1398, to fight the armies of Sultan Nasir-ud-Din Mahmud Shah Tughluq, which had already been weakened by a succession struggle within the royal family.\n\n=== Capture of Delhi (1398) ===\n[[File:Delhi after sack of Timur Lang, 1398.jpg|thumb|Delhi after sack of Timur Lang, 1398]]\n\nThe battle took place on 17 December 1398. Sultan Nasir-ud-Din Mahmud Shah Tughluq and the army of Mallu Iqbal<ref>Mallu, who later received the title of Iqbal Khan, was a noble in Siri and an ally of Muqarrab Khan, but later on betrayed him and Nusrat Khan, and allied with Nasir-ud-din Mahmud Shah.

Mahajan p.205</ref> had war elephants armored with chain mail and poison on their tusks.<ref name=\"marozzi-2004\" />{{rp|267}} As his Tatar forces were afraid of the elephants, Timur ordered his men to dig a trench in front of their positions. Timur then loaded his camels with as much wood and hay as they could carry. When the war elephants charged, Timur set the hay on fire and prodded the camels with iron sticks, causing them to charge at the elephants howling in pain: Timur had understood that elephants were easily panicked. Faced with the strange spectacle of camels flying straight at them with flames leaping from their backs, the elephants turned around and stampeded back toward their own lines. Timur capitalized on the subsequent disruption in the forces of Nasir-ud-Din Mahmud Shah Tughluq, securing an easy victory. Nasir-ud-Din Mahmud Shah Tughluq fled with remnants of his forces. Delhi was sacked and left in ruins. Before the battle for Delhi, Timur executed 100,000 captives.<ref name=\"EI\" />\n\nThe capture of the Delhi Sultanate was one of Timur's greatest victories, as at that time, Delhi was one of the richest cities in the world. After Delhi fell to Timur's army, uprisings by its citizens against the Turkic-Mongols began to occur, causing a retaliatory bloody massacre within the city walls. After three days of citizens uprising within Delhi, it was said that the city reeked of the decomposing bodies of its citizens with their heads being erected like structures and the bodies left as food for the birds by Timur's soldiers. Timur's invasion and destruction of Delhi continued the chaos that was still consuming India, and the city would not be able to recover from the great loss it suffered for almost a century.<ref name=\"marozzi-2004\" />{{rp|269\u2013274}}\n\n== Campaigns in the Levant ==\n[[File:Behzad timur egyptian.jpg|thumb|Timur defeating the [[Mamluk]] [[Sultan]] [[Nasir-ad-Din Faraj]] of [[Egypt]]]]\n[[File:Chlebowski-Bajazyt w niewoli.jpg|thumb|[[Bayezid I]] being held captive by Timur]]\n\nBefore the end of 1399, Timur started a war with [[Bayezid I]], sultan of the Ottoman Empire, and the [[Mamluk]] sultan of Egypt [[Nasir-ad-Din Faraj]].

Timur cited the killing of [[Hasan ibn Ali]] by the Umayyad caliph [[Muawiyah I]] and the killing of [[Husayn ibn Ali]] by [[Yazid I]] as the reason for his massacre of the inhabitants of Damascus.\n\nTimur invaded Baghdad in June 1401. After the capture of the city, 20,000 of its citizens were massacred. Timur ordered that every soldier should return with at least two severed human heads to show him. When they ran out of men to kill, many warriors killed prisoners captured earlier in the campaign, and when they ran out of prisoners to kill, many resorted to beheading their own wives.<ref>Ibn Arabshah, Timur the Great Amir, p. 168</ref>\n\n== Invasion of Anatolia ==\n\nIn the meantime, years of insulting letters had passed between Timur and Bayezid. Both rulers insulted each other in their own way while Timur preferred to undermine Bayezid's position as a ruler and play down the significance of his military successes. \n\nThis is the excerpt from one of Timur's letters addressed to Ottoman sultan:\n\n\"Believe me, you are but pismire ant: don't seek to fight the elephants for they'll crush you under their feet.

Bayezid was captured in battle and subsequently died in captivity, initiating the twelve-year [[Ottoman Interregnum]] period.

The legend has it that Timur, wounded by an enemy arrow, found shelter at the abandoned ruins of an old fortress in the desert. Lamenting his fate, Timur saw a little ant carrying a grain up the side of a collapsed wall. Thinking that the end was close, Timur directed all his attention to that ant and watched how troubled by the wind or the size of her cargo, the ant fell back down to the ground each time she climbed the wall. Timur counted overall 69 attempts and finally, on the 70th try, the little ant succeeded and made her way into the nest with a precious prize. If an ant can persevere like this, Timur thought, then surely a man can do the same. Inspired by the diligent ant, he decided that he would never again lose hope, and eventually the chain of events, coupled with his persistence and military genius led to him becoming arguably the most powerful monarch of his era.<ref>John C. Johnson, \"Tamerlane and the ant\", Stories, 2011</ref>\n\nThere is a shared view that Timur's real motive for his campaigns was his imperialistic ambition. However, Timur's following words: \"The whole expanse of the inhabited part of the world is not large enough to have two kings\" explains that his true desire was \"to amaze the world\", and through his destructive campaigns, to produce an impression rather than to achieve enduring results. This is supported by the fact that besides Iran, Timur simply plundered the states he invaded with a purpose of enriching his native Samarqand and neglected the conquered areas, which may have resulted in a relatively quick disintegration of his Empire after his death<ref name=\"barthold\">{{cite book |last1=Barthold |first1=V.V. |title=Four studies on the History of Central Asia, vol. 1 |date=1962 |publisher=Leiden, E.J.Brill |pages=59-60 |edition=Second Printing, 1962}}</ref>.   \n\nTimur used Persian expressions in his conversations often, and his motto was the Persian phrase ''r\u0101st\u012b rust\u012b'' ({{lang|fa|\u0631\u0627\u0633\u062a\u06cc \u0631\u0633\u062a\u06cc}}, meaning \"truth is safety\" or ''\"veritas salus\"'').<ref name=Fischel />\n\n== Exchanges with Europe ==\n{{Main|Timurid relations with Europe}}\n[[File:Letter of Tamerlane to Charles VI 1402.jpg|thumb|upright|Letter of Timur to [[Charles VI of France]], 1402, a witness to [[Timurid relations with Europe]].

Relations between the court of [[Henry III of Castile]] and that of Timur played an important part in medieval [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] diplomacy. In 1402, the time of the [[Battle of Ankara]], two Spanish ambassadors were already with Timur: Pelayo de Sotomayor and Fernando de Palazuelos. Later, Timur sent to the court of the [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n#Le\u00f3n and Castile|Kingdom of Le\u00f3n and Castile]] a Chagatai ambassador named Hajji Muhammad al-Qazi with letters and gifts.\n\nIn return, Henry III of Castile sent a famous embassy to Timur's court in Samarkand in 1403\u201306, led by [[Ruy Gonz\u00e1lez de Clavijo]], with two other ambassadors, Alfonso Paez and Gomez de Salazar. On their return, Timur affirmed that he regarded the king of Castile \"as his very own son\".\n\nAccording to Clavijo, Timur's good treatment of the Spanish delegation contrasted with the disdain shown by his host toward the envoys of the \"lord of [[Cathay]]\" (i.e., the Yongle Emperor), the Chinese ruler. Clavijo's visit to Samarkand allowed him to report to the European audience on the news from [[Cathay]] (China), which few Europeans had been able to visit directly in the century that had passed since the travels of [[Marco Polo]].\n\nThe French archives preserve:\n*A 30 July 1402 letter from Timur to [[Charles VI of France]], suggesting that he send traders to Asia.

In fact, it is difficult to define the sphere of either side of the administration and we find Persians and Chaghatays sharing many tasks. (In discussing the settled bureaucracy and the people who worked within it I use the word Persian in a cultural rather than ethnological sense. In almost all the territories which Tem\u00fcr incorporated into his realm Persian was the primary language of administration and literary culture. Thus the language of the settled 'diwan' was Persian and its scribes had to be thoroughly adept in Persian culture, whatever their ethnic origin.) Tem\u00fcr's Chaghatay emirs were often involved in civil and provincial administration and even in financial affairs, traditionally the province of Persian bureaucracy.\"</ref> In addition, during his reign, some contributions to Turkic literature were penned, with Turkic cultural influence expanding and flourishing as a result.

This was the second military expedition that he led, and its success led to further operations, among them the subjugation of [[Khwarezm]] and [[Urgench]].\n\nFollowing Qazaghan's murder, disputes arose among the many claimants to [[sovereign]] power. [[Tughlugh Timur]] of [[Kashgar]], the Khan of the Eastern Chagatai Khanate, another descendant of Genghis Khan, invaded, interrupting this infighting. Timur was sent to negotiate with the invader but joined with him instead and was rewarded with Transoxania. At about this time, his father died and Timur also became chief of the Berlas. Tughlugh then attempted to set his son [[Ilyas Khoja]] over Transoxania, but Timur repelled this invasion with a smaller force.<ref name=hannah />\n\n== Rise to power ==\n[[File:Timur during attack on Balkh 1370.jpg|thumb|Timur commanding the [[Siege of Balkh (1370)|Siege of Balkh]]]]\n\nIt was in this period that Timur reduced the [[Chagatai Khanate|Chagatai khans]] to the position of [[figurehead]]s while he ruled in their name. Also during this period, Timur and his brother-in-law Amir Husayn, who were at first fellow fugitives and wanderers in joint adventures, became rivals and antagonists. The relationship between them began to become strained after Husayn abandoned efforts to carry out Timur's orders to finish off Ilya Khoja (former governor of Mawarannah) close to Tishnet.<ref name=\"marozzi-2004\" />{{rp|40}}\n\nTimur began to gain a following of people in Balkh, consisting of merchants, fellow tribesmen, Muslim clergy, aristocracy and agricultural workers, because of his kindness in sharing his belongings with them. This contrasted Timur's behavior with that of Husayn, who alienated these people, took many possessions from them via his heavy tax laws and selfishly spent the tax money building elaborate structures.<ref name=\"marozzi-2004\" />{{rp|41\u20132}} Around 1370, Husayn surrendered to Timur and was later assassinated, which allowed Timur to be formally proclaimed sovereign at [[Balkh]]. He married Husayn's wife [[Saray Mulk Khanum]], a descendant of Genghis Khan, allowing him to become imperial ruler of the Chaghatay tribe.<ref name=\"marozzi-2004\" />\n\n== Legitimization of Timur's rule ==\n[[File:TimuridEmpire1400.png|thumb|300px|The extent of the [[Timurid Empire]]]]\n\nTimur's Turco-Mongolian heritage provided opportunities and challenges as he sought to rule the Mongol Empire and the Muslim world. According to the Mongol traditions, Timur could not claim the title of ''khan'' or rule the Mongol Empire because he was not a descendant of [[Genghis Khan]]. Therefore, Timur set up a puppet [[Chagatai Khan|Chaghatay Khan]], [[Suurgatmish|Suyurghatmish]], as the nominal ruler of Balkh as he pretended to act as a \"protector of the member of a Chinggisid line, that of Genghis Khan's eldest son, [[Jochi]]\".<ref name=\"manz-2002-3\">{{cite journal|last=Manz|first=Beatrice Forbes|title=Tamerlane's Career and Its Uses|journal=Journal of World History|year=2002|volume=13|page=3|doi=10.1353/jwh.2002.0017}}</ref> Timur instead used the title of [[Amir]] meaning general, and acting in the name of the [[Chagatai Khanate|Chagatai]] ruler of Transoxania.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|106}} To reinforce this position, Timur claimed the title Guregen (royal son-in-law) when he married [[Saray Mulk Khanum]], a princess of Chinggisid descent.<ref name=\":1\" />{{Rp|14}}\n\nAs with the title of Khan, Timur similarly could not claim the supreme title of the Islamic world, [[Caliph]], because the \"office was limited to the [[Quraysh]], the tribe of the [[Prophet Muhammad]]\". Therefore, Timur reacted to the challenge by creating a myth and image of himself as a \"supernatural personal power\" ordained by God.<ref name=\"manz-2002-3\" /> Otherwise he was described as a spiritual descendant of Ali, thus taken lineage of both to Genghis Khan and the Quraysh.<ref>Denise Aigle ''The Mongol Empire between Myth and Reality: Studies in Anthropological History'' BRILL, 28 October 2014 p. 132</ref>\n\n== Period of expansion ==\nTimur spent the next 35 years in various [[List of wars|wars]] and expeditions. He not only consolidated his rule at home by the subjugation of his foes, but sought extension of territory by encroachments upon the lands of foreign potentates. His conquests to the west and northwest led him to the lands near the [[Caspian Sea]] and to the banks of the [[Ural River|Ural]] and the [[Volga]]. Conquests in the south and south-West encompassed almost every province in [[Persia]], including [[Baghdad]], [[Karbala]] and Northern Iraq.\n\nOne of the most formidable of Timur's opponents was another Mongol ruler, a descendant of Genghis Khan named [[Tokhtamysh]]. After having been a refugee in Timur's court, Tokhtamysh became ruler both of the eastern [[White Horde|Kipchak]] and the [[Golden Horde]]. After his accession, he quarreled with Timur over the possession of [[Khiva|Khwarizm]] and [[Azerbaijan]]. However, Timur still supported him against the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Russians]] and in 1382 Tokhtamysh invaded the Muscovite dominion and [[Siege of Moscow (1382)|burned Moscow]].<ref>Nicholas V. Raisanovsky; Mark D. Steinberg: ''A History of Russia'' Seventh Edition, pg 93</ref>\n\n[[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] tradition states that later, in 1395 Timur, having reached the frontier of [[Principality of Ryazan]], had taken [[Elets]] and started advancing towards Moscow. Great Prince [[Vasily I of Moscow]] went with an army to [[Kolomna]] and halted at the banks of the [[Oka River]]. The clergy brought the famed [[Theotokos of Vladimir]] icon from [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] to Moscow. Along the way people prayed kneeling: \u201cO Mother of God, save the land of Russia!\u201d Suddenly, Timur's armies retreated. In memory of this miraculous deliverance of the Russian land from Timur on 26 August, the all-Russian celebration in honor of the Meeting of the Vladimir Icon of the Most Holy Mother of God was established.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://oca.org/saints/lives/2016/08/26/102402-commemoration-of-the-vladimir-icon-of-the-mother-of-god-and-the|title=Commemoration of the Vladimir Icon of the Mother of God and the deliverance of Moscow from the Invasion of Tamerlane|website=oca.org|accessdate=5 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Conquest of Persia ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2019}}\n[[File:Tamerlane Besieging Urganj.JPG|thumb|Timur besieges the historic city of [[Urganj]].]]\n[[File:Timur orders campaign against Georgia.jpg|thumb|Timur orders [[Timur's invasions of Georgia|campaign]] against [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].]]\n[[File:Timur's army attacks Nerges, Georgia.jpg|thumb|Emir Timur's army attacks the survivors of the town of Nerges, in Georgia, in the spring of 1396.]]\n\nAfter the death of [[Abu Sa'id (Ilkhanid dynasty)|Abu Sa'id]], ruler of the [[Ilkhanate]], in 1335, there was a power vacuum in Persia. In the end, Persia was split amongst the [[Muzaffarids (Iran)|Muzaffarids]], [[Kartids]], [[Eretnids]], [[Chobanids]], [[Injuids]], [[Jalayirids]], and [[Sarbadars]]. In 1383, Timur started his lengthy military conquest of Persia, though he already ruled over much of Persian [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] by 1381, after Khwaja Mas'ud, of the [[Sarbadar]] dynasty surrendered. Timur began his Persian campaign with [[Herat]], capital of the [[Kurt dynasty|Kartid dynasty]]. When Herat did not surrender he reduced the city to rubble and massacred most of its citizens; it remained in ruins until [[Shah Rukh]] ordered its reconstruction.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=96ec98LieGsC&pg=PA39&lpg=PA39&dq=siege+of+herat+timur#v=onepage&q=siege%20of%20herat%20timur&f=false|title=Mughal Gardens|work=google.ca|isbn=9780884022350|last1=Wescoat|first1=James L.|last2=Wolschke-Bulmahn|first2=Joachim|year=1996}}</ref> Timur then sent a General to capture rebellious [[Kandahar]]. With the capture of Herat the Kartid kingdom surrendered and became vassals of Timur; it would later be annexed outright less than a decade later in 1389 by Timur's son [[Miran Shah]].\n\nTimur then headed west to capture the [[Zagros Mountains]], passing through [[Mazandaran]]. During his travel through the north of Persia, he captured the then town of [[Tehran]], which surrendered and was thus treated mercifully. He laid siege to [[Soltaniyeh]] in 1384. [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] revolted one year later, so Timur destroyed Isfizar, and the prisoners were cemented into the walls alive. The next year the kingdom of Sistan, under the [[Mihrabanids|Mihrabanid dynasty]], was ravaged, and its capital at [[Zaranj]] was destroyed. Timur then returned to his capital of [[Samarkand]], where he began planning for his [[Timur's invasion of Georgia|Georgian campaign]] and [[Tokhtamysh\u2013Timur war|Golden Horde]] invasion. In 1386, Timur passed through [[Mazandaran]] as he had when trying to capture the Zagros. He went near the city of [[Soltaniyeh]], which he had previously captured but instead turned north and captured [[Tabriz]] with little resistance, along with [[Maragha]]. He ordered heavy taxation of the people, which was collected by Adil Aqa, who was also given control over Soltaniyeh. Adil was later executed because Timur suspected him of corruption.\n\nTimur then went north to begin his Georgian and Golden Horde campaigns, pausing his full-scale invasion of Persia. When he returned, he found his generals had done well in protecting the cities and lands he had conquered in Persia. Though many rebelled, and his son [[Miran Shah]], who may have been [[regent]], was forced to annex rebellious vassal dynasties, his holdings remained. So he proceeded to capture the rest of Persia, specifically the two major southern cities of [[Isfahan]] and [[Shiraz]]. When he arrived with his army at [[Isfahan]] in 1387, the city [[Siege of Isfahan (1387)|immediately surrendered]]; he treated it with relative mercy as he normally did with cities that surrendered (unlike Herat). However, after Isfahan revolted against Timur's taxes by killing the tax collectors and some of Timur's soldiers, he ordered the massacre of the city's citizens; the death toll is reckoned at between 100,000 and 200,000.<ref name=\"Chaliand 2007 87\">{{cite book|last=Chaliand|first=Gerard|title=The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to Al Qaeda|year=2007|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-24709-3|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofterrori00grar|url-access=registration|quote=isfahan Timur.|author2=Arnaud Blin |page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofterrori00grar/page/87 87]}}</ref> An eye-witness counted more than 28 towers constructed of about 1,500 heads each.<ref>Fisher, W.B.; Jackson, P.; Lockhart, L.; Boyle, J.A. : The Cambridge History of Iran, p55.</ref> This has been described as a \"systematic use of terror against towns...an integral element of Tamerlane's strategic element\", which he viewed as preventing bloodshed by discouraging resistance. His massacres were selective and he spared the artistic and educated.<ref name=\"Chaliand 2007 87\" /> This would later influence the next great Persian conqueror: [[Nader Shah]].\n\nTimur then began a five-year campaign to the west in 1392, attacking [[Iranian Kurdistan|Persian Kurdistan]]. In 1393, Shiraz was captured after surrendering, and the Muzaffarids became vassals of Timur, though prince [[Shah Mansur (Persia)|Shah Mansur]] rebelled but was defeated, and the [[Muzafarids]] were annexed. Shortly after Georgia was devastated so that the Golden Horde could not use it to threaten northern Iran. In the same year, Timur caught Baghdad by surprise in August by marching there in only eight days from Shiraz. Sultan [[Ahmad Jalayir]] fled to Syria, where the Mamluk Sultan [[Barquq]] protected him and killed Timur's envoys. Timur left the [[Sarbadar]] prince Khwaja Mas'ud to govern [[Baghdad]], but he was driven out when [[Ahmad Jalayir]] returned. Ahmad was unpopular but got some dangerous help from [[Qara Yusuf]] of the [[Kara Koyunlu]]; he fled again in 1399, this time to the Ottomans.\n\n=== Tokhtamysh\u2013Timur war ===\nIn the meantime, Tokhtamysh, now khan of the [[Golden Horde]], turned against his patron and in 1385 invaded [[Azerbaijan]]. The inevitable response by Timur resulted in the [[Tokhtamysh\u2013Timur war]]. In the initial stage of the war, Timur won a victory at the [[Battle of the Kondurcha River]]. After the battle Tokhtamysh and some of his army were allowed to escape. After Tokhtamysh's initial defeat, Timur invaded Muscovy to the north of Tokhtamysh's holdings. Timur's army burned [[Ryazan]] and advanced on Moscow. He was pulled away before reaching the Oka River by Tokhtamysh's renewed campaign in the south.<ref>Nicholas V. Raisanovsky; Mark D. Steinberg: ''A History of Russia'' Seventh Edition, pg 94</ref>\n\nIn the first phase of the conflict with Tokhtamysh, Timur led an army of over 100,000 men north for more than 700 miles into the steppe. He then rode west about 1,000 miles advancing in a front more than 10 miles wide. During this advance, Timur's army got far enough north to be in a region of [[midnight sun|very long summer days]] causing complaints by his Muslim soldiers about keeping a long schedule of [[salat|prayers]]. It was then that Tokhtamysh's army was boxed in against the east bank of the Volga River in the [[Orenburg]] region and destroyed at the [[Battle of the Kondurcha River]], in 1391.\n\nIn the second phase of the conflict, Timur took a different route against the enemy by invading the realm of Tokhtamysh via the [[Caucasus]] region. In 1395, Timur defeated Tokhtamysh in the [[Battle of the Terek River]], concluding the struggle between the two monarchs. Tokhtamysh was unable to restore his power or prestige, and he was killed about a decade later in the area of present-day [[Tyumen]]. During the course of Timur's campaigns, his army destroyed [[Sarai (city)|Sarai]], the capital of the Golden Horde, and [[Astrakhan]], subsequently disrupting the Golden Horde's [[Silk Road]]. The Golden Horde no longer held power after their losses to Timur.\n\n=== Ismailis ===\nIn May 1393, Timur's army invaded the [[Anjudan]], crippling the [[Ismaili]] village only a year after his assault on the Ismailis in [[Mazandaran]]. The village was prepared for the attack, evidenced by its fortress and system of tunnels. Undeterred, Timur's soldiers flooded the tunnels by cutting into a channel overhead. Timur's reasons for attacking this village are not yet well understood. However, it has been suggested that his [[Timur#Personal life|religious persuasions]] and view of himself as an [[Timur#Indian campaign|executor of divine will]] may have contributed to his motivations.<ref name=\"Virani, Shafique N 2007, p. 116\">Virani, Shafique N.

His invasion did not go unopposed and he encountered resistance from the Governor of [[Meerut]] during the march to Delhi. Timur was still able to continue his approach to Delhi, arriving in 1398, to fight the armies of Sultan Nasir-ud-Din Mahmud Shah Tughluq, which had already been weakened by a succession struggle within the royal family.\n\n=== Capture of Delhi (1398) ===\n[[File:Delhi after sack of Timur Lang, 1398.jpg|thumb|Delhi after sack of Timur Lang, 1398]]\n\nThe battle took place on 17 December 1398. Sultan Nasir-ud-Din Mahmud Shah Tughluq and the army of Mallu Iqbal<ref>Mallu, who later received the title of Iqbal Khan, was a noble in Siri and an ally of Muqarrab Khan, but later on betrayed him and Nusrat Khan, and allied with Nasir-ud-din Mahmud Shah.

Timur then loaded his camels with as much wood and hay as they could carry. When the war elephants charged, Timur set the hay on fire and prodded the camels with iron sticks, causing them to charge at the elephants howling in pain: Timur had understood that elephants were easily panicked. Faced with the strange spectacle of camels flying straight at them with flames leaping from their backs, the elephants turned around and stampeded back toward their own lines. Timur capitalized on the subsequent disruption in the forces of Nasir-ud-Din Mahmud Shah Tughluq, securing an easy victory. Nasir-ud-Din Mahmud Shah Tughluq fled with remnants of his forces. Delhi was sacked and left in ruins. Before the battle for Delhi, Timur executed 100,000 captives.<ref name=\"EI\" />\n\nThe capture of the Delhi Sultanate was one of Timur's greatest victories, as at that time, Delhi was one of the richest cities in the world. After Delhi fell to Timur's army, uprisings by its citizens against the Turkic-Mongols began to occur, causing a retaliatory bloody massacre within the city walls. After three days of citizens uprising within Delhi, it was said that the city reeked of the decomposing bodies of its citizens with their heads being erected like structures and the bodies left as food for the birds by Timur's soldiers. Timur's invasion and destruction of Delhi continued the chaos that was still consuming India, and the city would not be able to recover from the great loss it suffered for almost a century.<ref name=\"marozzi-2004\" />{{rp|269\u2013274}}\n\n== Campaigns in the Levant ==\n[[File:Behzad timur egyptian.jpg|thumb|Timur defeating the [[Mamluk]] [[Sultan]] [[Nasir-ad-Din Faraj]] of [[Egypt]]]]\n[[File:Chlebowski-Bajazyt w niewoli.jpg|thumb|[[Bayezid I]] being held captive by Timur]]\n\nBefore the end of 1399, Timur started a war with [[Bayezid I]], sultan of the Ottoman Empire, and the [[Mamluk]] sultan of Egypt [[Nasir-ad-Din Faraj]].

Timur cited the killing of [[Hasan ibn Ali]] by the Umayyad caliph [[Muawiyah I]] and the killing of [[Husayn ibn Ali]] by [[Yazid I]] as the reason for his massacre of the inhabitants of Damascus.\n\nTimur invaded Baghdad in June 1401. After the capture of the city, 20,000 of its citizens were massacred. Timur ordered that every soldier should return with at least two severed human heads to show him. When they ran out of men to kill, many warriors killed prisoners captured earlier in the campaign, and when they ran out of prisoners to kill, many resorted to beheading their own wives.<ref>Ibn Arabshah, Timur the Great Amir, p. 168</ref>\n\n== Invasion of Anatolia ==\n\nIn the meantime, years of insulting letters had passed between Timur and Bayezid. Both rulers insulted each other in their own way while Timur preferred to undermine Bayezid's position as a ruler and play down the significance of his military successes. \n\nThis is the excerpt from one of Timur's letters addressed to Ottoman sultan:\n\n\"Believe me, you are but pismire ant: don't seek to fight the elephants for they'll crush you under their feet. Shall a petty prince such as you are contend with us? But your rodomontades (braggadocio) are not extraordinary; for a [[Turkmen people|Turcoman]] never spake with judgement.

Bayezid was captured in battle and subsequently died in captivity, initiating the twelve-year [[Ottoman Interregnum]] period. Timur's stated motivation for attacking Bayezid and the Ottoman Empire was the restoration of [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]] authority. Timur saw the Seljuks as the rightful rulers of [[Anatolia]] as they had been granted rule by Mongol conquerors, illustrating again Timur's interest with Genghizid legitimacy.\n\nAfter the Ankara victory, Timur's army ravaged Western Anatolia, with Muslim writers complaining that the Timurid army acted more like a horde of savages than that of a civilized conqueror.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} But Timur did [[Siege of Smyrna|besiege and take]] the city of [[Smyrna]], a stronghold of the Christian [[Knights Hospitalers]], thus he referred to himself as ''[[ghazi warriors|ghazi]]'' or \"Warrior of Islam\".

The legend has it that Timur, wounded by an enemy arrow, found shelter at the abandoned ruins of an old fortress in the desert. Lamenting his fate, Timur saw a little ant carrying a grain up the side of a collapsed wall. Thinking that the end was close, Timur directed all his attention to that ant and watched how troubled by the wind or the size of her cargo, the ant fell back down to the ground each time she climbed the wall. Timur counted overall 69 attempts and finally, on the 70th try, the little ant succeeded and made her way into the nest with a precious prize. If an ant can persevere like this, Timur thought, then surely a man can do the same. Inspired by the diligent ant, he decided that he would never again lose hope, and eventually the chain of events, coupled with his persistence and military genius led to him becoming arguably the most powerful monarch of his era.<ref>John C. Johnson, \"Tamerlane and the ant\", Stories, 2011</ref>\n\nThere is a shared view that Timur's real motive for his campaigns was his imperialistic ambition. However, Timur's following words: \"The whole expanse of the inhabited part of the world is not large enough to have two kings\" explains that his true desire was \"to amaze the world\", and through his destructive campaigns, to produce an impression rather than to achieve enduring results. This is supported by the fact that besides Iran, Timur simply plundered the states he invaded with a purpose of enriching his native Samarqand and neglected the conquered areas, which may have resulted in a relatively quick disintegration of his Empire after his death<ref name=\"barthold\">{{cite book |last1=Barthold |first1=V.V. |title=Four studies on the History of Central Asia, vol. 1 |date=1962 |publisher=Leiden, E.J.Brill |pages=59-60 |edition=Second Printing, 1962}}</ref>.   \n\nTimur used Persian expressions in his conversations often, and his motto was the Persian phrase ''r\u0101st\u012b rust\u012b'' ({{lang|fa|\u0631\u0627\u0633\u062a\u06cc \u0631\u0633\u062a\u06cc}}, meaning \"truth is safety\" or ''\"veritas salus\"'').<ref name=Fischel />\n\n== Exchanges with Europe ==\n{{Main|Timurid relations with Europe}}\n[[File:Letter of Tamerlane to Charles VI 1402.jpg|thumb|upright|Letter of Timur to [[Charles VI of France]], 1402, a witness to [[Timurid relations with Europe]].

Relations between the court of [[Henry III of Castile]] and that of Timur played an important part in medieval [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] diplomacy. In 1402, the time of the [[Battle of Ankara]], two Spanish ambassadors were already with Timur: Pelayo de Sotomayor and Fernando de Palazuelos. Later, Timur sent to the court of the [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n#Le\u00f3n and Castile|Kingdom of Le\u00f3n and Castile]] a Chagatai ambassador named Hajji Muhammad al-Qazi with letters and gifts.\n\nIn return, Henry III of Castile sent a famous embassy to Timur's court in Samarkand in 1403\u201306, led by [[Ruy Gonz\u00e1lez de Clavijo]], with two other ambassadors, Alfonso Paez and Gomez de Salazar. On their return, Timur affirmed that he regarded the king of Castile \"as his very own son\".\n\nAccording to Clavijo, Timur's good treatment of the Spanish delegation contrasted with the disdain shown by his host toward the envoys of the \"lord of [[Cathay]]\" (i.e., the Yongle Emperor), the Chinese ruler. Clavijo's visit to Samarkand allowed him to report to the European audience on the news from [[Cathay]] (China), which few Europeans had been able to visit directly in the century that had passed since the travels of [[Marco Polo]].\n\nThe French archives preserve:\n*A 30 July 1402 letter from Timur to [[Charles VI of France]], suggesting that he send traders to Asia.

He was responsible for the effective destruction of the Nestorian Christian [[Church of the East]] in much of Asia. Thus, while Timur still retains a positive image in Muslim Central Asia, he is vilified by many in [[Arabia]], [[Iraq]], Persia, and India, where some of his greatest atrocities were carried out.

These dolls, representing the lowest price-range (less than US$75), are usually made of welded [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] and bear only a passing resemblance to actual people.  They have an artificial and typically crudely designed vagina or [[Human penis|penis]], but due to their affordability many users are willing to overlook their shortcomings. They often burst at the seams after a few uses, although they are commonly given as [[gag gift]]s and therefore many may not be used at all. In Russia for some years the Bubble Baba Challenge humorously featured participants river rafting on blowup dolls as a matter of entertainment but in 2013 the race was cancelled on \"health and safety\" grounds.<ref>{{cite web | title = Home page | url = http://www.bubblebabachallenge.ru | website = bubblebabachallenge.ru | publisher = The Bubble Baba Challenge }}</ref>\n\nAt the middle market price-range ($100 to approximately $1,000), dolls are made of thicker vinyl or heavy [[latex]] without welded seams or a polyurethane and silicone mixture, typically surrounding a foam core.  Most have plastic [[mannequin]]-style heads and styled wigs, plastic or glass eyes, and occasionally properly moulded hands and feet. Some vinyl dolls can contain water-filled body areas such as the [[breasts]] or [[buttocks]]. Latex dolls were made in Hungary, China and France but only the French manufacturer Domax now remains in production. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nThe manufacturing process causes most latex dolls to be delivered with a fine coating of [[zinc oxide]] covering the skin, which is usually removed by the consumer by placing the doll under the [[shower]]. Otherwise, latex is an inert and non-toxic natural material; although a small percentage of users may discover a [[latex allergy]].\n\nThe most expensive sex dolls (approximately $1,200 and up) are usually made from [[silicone]] (usually above $3,000 at 2016 prices) or [[thermoplastic elastomer]] known as TPE (below $3,000). Dolls made of either material can be very lifelike, with faces and bodies modeled on real people in some instances, with realistic skin material (similar to that used for movie special effects), and with realistic (or even real) [[hair]]. These dolls usually have an articulated [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] or metal [[skeleton]] with flexible joints that allows them to be positioned in a variety of positions for display and for sexual acts. Silicone or TPE dolls are much heavier than vinyl or latex inflatable ones (which consist mostly of air), but are roughly half the weight of a real human being of comparable size.\n\nBecause of their ability to be posed in different positions silicone dolls are popular with artists and photographers as models.<ref>{{cite news | title = Interview with Stacy Leigh | url = http://www.acclaimmag.com/arts/interview-stacy-leigh-nsfw/ | work = Acclaim Mag}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = Home page | url = http://www.dollstory.eu/dollstory.aspx?code=video-poupees-tps&lang=EN | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080412131418/http://www.dollstory.eu/dollstory.aspx?code=video-poupees-tps&lang=EN | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2008-04-12 | publisher = Doll Story (French outlet of Japanese dolls) | quote = These silicone dolls are sold to passionate clients, but also to sculptors, painters and even photographers }} Links to examples of photographic work.</ref>\n\nIn Japan, sex dolls are known as {{nihongo|\"Dutch wives\"|[[:ja:\u30c0\u30c3\u30c1\u30ef\u30a4\u30d5|\u30c0\u30c3\u30c1\u30ef\u30a4\u30d5]]|datchi waifu}}, which now refers to relatively inexpensive dolls.

There are even mailing lists for discussing techniques and experiences with ''MLDs'' (material love dolls) {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}.\n\nSome inflatable sex dolls are made in the form of animals, most notably [[sheep]] and cows.

Having had the dolls seized by [[Her Majesty's Customs and Excise]] officers, [[David Sullivan (publisher)|David Sullivan]]'s Conegate Ltd. took the case all the way to the [[European Court of Justice]], and won in 1987.<ref>Conegate v Commissioners of Customs and Excise (No 121/85) Queen's Bench (1987) 254.</ref> Britain was forced to lift its stringent import prohibitions dating from 1876, because for imports from within the [[European Community]] they constituted a barrier to free trade under the terms of the [[Treaty of Rome]].\n\nShin Takagi, founder of the company Trottla, manufactures lifelike child sex dolls in the belief that doing so provides a safe and legal outlet for men expressing pedophilic desires.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/bradesposito/abf-trottla |publisher=[[Buzzfeed]] |title=These Child Sex Dolls Will Not Be Allowed Into Australia |first=Brad |last=Esposito |date=April 15, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170528010138/https://www.buzzfeed.com/bradesposito/abf-trottla |archive-date=May 28, 2017 |quote=Takagi believes the sex dolls can help aid paedophiles in Australia by stopping them from acting on their desires.}}</ref><ref name=\"Atlantic\">{{cite magazine |magazine=[[The Atlantic]] |title=Can Child Dolls Keep Pedophiles from Offending? |first=Roc |last=Morin |date=January 11, 2016 |access-date=May 27, 2017 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/01/can-child-dolls-keep-pedophiles-from-offending/423324/}}</ref> This has been disputed by [[paraphilia]] researcher Dr. Peter J.

These dolls, representing the lowest price-range (less than US$75), are usually made of welded [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] and bear only a passing resemblance to actual people.  They have an artificial and typically crudely designed vagina or [[Human penis|penis]], but due to their affordability many users are willing to overlook their shortcomings. They often burst at the seams after a few uses, although they are commonly given as [[gag gift]]s and therefore many may not be used at all. In Russia for some years the Bubble Baba Challenge humorously featured participants river rafting on blowup dolls as a matter of entertainment but in 2013 the race was cancelled on \"health and safety\" grounds.<ref>{{cite web | title = Home page | url = http://www.bubblebabachallenge.ru | website = bubblebabachallenge.ru | publisher = The Bubble Baba Challenge }}</ref>\n\nAt the middle market price-range ($100 to approximately $1,000), dolls are made of thicker vinyl or heavy [[latex]] without welded seams or a polyurethane and silicone mixture, typically surrounding a foam core.  Most have plastic [[mannequin]]-style heads and styled wigs, plastic or glass eyes, and occasionally properly moulded hands and feet. Some vinyl dolls can contain water-filled body areas such as the [[breasts]] or [[buttocks]]. Latex dolls were made in Hungary, China and France but only the French manufacturer Domax now remains in production. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nThe manufacturing process causes most latex dolls to be delivered with a fine coating of [[zinc oxide]] covering the skin, which is usually removed by the consumer by placing the doll under the [[shower]]. Otherwise, latex is an inert and non-toxic natural material; although a small percentage of users may discover a [[latex allergy]].\n\nThe most expensive sex dolls (approximately $1,200 and up) are usually made from [[silicone]] (usually above $3,000 at 2016 prices) or [[thermoplastic elastomer]] known as TPE (below $3,000). Dolls made of either material can be very lifelike, with faces and bodies modeled on real people in some instances, with realistic skin material (similar to that used for movie special effects), and with realistic (or even real) [[hair]]. These dolls usually have an articulated [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] or metal [[skeleton]] with flexible joints that allows them to be positioned in a variety of positions for display and for sexual acts. Silicone or TPE dolls are much heavier than vinyl or latex inflatable ones (which consist mostly of air), but are roughly half the weight of a real human being of comparable size.\n\nBecause of their ability to be posed in different positions silicone dolls are popular with artists and photographers as models.<ref>{{cite news | title = Interview with Stacy Leigh | url = http://www.acclaimmag.com/arts/interview-stacy-leigh-nsfw/ | work = Acclaim Mag}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = Home page | url = http://www.dollstory.eu/dollstory.aspx?code=video-poupees-tps&lang=EN | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080412131418/http://www.dollstory.eu/dollstory.aspx?code=video-poupees-tps&lang=EN | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2008-04-12 | publisher = Doll Story (French outlet of Japanese dolls) | quote = These silicone dolls are sold to passionate clients, but also to sculptors, painters and even photographers }} Links to examples of photographic work.</ref>\n\nIn Japan, sex dolls are known as {{nihongo|\"Dutch wives\"|[[:ja:\u30c0\u30c3\u30c1\u30ef\u30a4\u30d5|\u30c0\u30c3\u30c1\u30ef\u30a4\u30d5]]|datchi waifu}}, which now refers to relatively inexpensive dolls.

The market has grown for two main reasons. Firstly, the last twenty years have seen huge improvements over earlier types of sex dolls, and customers come to realize this through using the web. Secondly, the method of retail purchase has also improved, now showing customers what the actual doll, seams, hair, and even orifices look like.\n\nIn China the market has mushroomed on account of the demographic effects of the one child policy and accordingly numerous new Chinese manufacturers have appeared in recent years.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Jiang | first = Quanbao | title = The predicament of bare branches' sexuality | journal = [[Electronic Journal of Human Sexuality]] | volume = 15 | publisher = [[Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality]] | date = September 18, 2012 | url = http://www.ejhs.org/volume15/Bare.html | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\n== Non-standard forms ==\nIn Japan one can purchase inflatable love pillows  or \"[[dakimakura]]\" that are printed with a life-size picture of a porn star or anime character. Other less common novelty love dolls include overweight, intersex, elderly and alien dolls, which are usable for pleasure but also tend to be given as gag gifts. Some inflatable dolls even have the form of children.\n\nSome companies manufacture cloth sex dolls using the same technology that is used to create plush toys. With widespread cultural use of the internet amongst younger generations, numerous forums exist for amateurs who create their own sex dolls from fabric or other materials. There are even mailing lists for discussing techniques and experiences with ''MLDs'' (material love dolls) {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}.\n\nSome inflatable sex dolls are made in the form of animals, most notably [[sheep]] and cows. These dolls are more of a joke gift or party novelty, and are often not suitable for sexual use{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}.\n\n== New materials and technologies ==\nSilicone dolls were at first made from tin-cure silicone but platinum technology has better longevity, less prone to tears and compression marks. For this reason the \"[[RealDoll]]\" manufacturer reported switching from the tin to the platinum material in June 2009<ref>[https://www.documentarystorm.com/guys-and-dolls/ Guys and Dolls Documentary] DocumentaryStorm.com. Retrieved 22 February 2019.</ref> and all other manufacturers have followed suit.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nSince 2012 or so a [[thermoplastic elastomer]] alternative known as TPE has come into common use particularly by Chinese manufacturers which has enabled realistic dolls to be made which are cheaper than those composed of the high quality expensive [[platinum cure silicone]].<ref>[https://dollview.com/silicone-vs-tpe/ DollView.com. Silicone vs TPE Sex Dolls: Which is Better?] DollView.com. 27 April 2018. Retrieved 22 February 2019.</ref>\n\nCybOrgasMatrix dolls used an elastic gel, which they claimed to be superior to silicone in elasticity, [[shape memory]], and durability. Both this company and the company \"First Androids\" once offered pelvic thruster motor, audio capability and heated orifices, though these options are no longer available. Several modern doll manufacturers now offer the last option on their silicone dolls, with the addition of an internal heating system.\n\n==Legal restrictions==\nThe importation of sex dolls for men has been banned in [[Botswana]] according to Section 178 of the Botswana Penal Code. The law further abolishes the right to \"possess, lend, trade in, export, import, and or exhibit obscene objects or any objects tending to corrupt morals in Botswana\", which includes sex dolls.<ref>{{cite news | last = Ngwira | first = Robert | title = Sex dolls banned in Botswana | url = http://www.faceofmalawi.com/2018/02/sex-dolls-banned-in-botswana/ | work = Face of Malawi | date = 5 February 2018 | access-date = 7 February 2018 }}</ref>\n\n===Austria===\n\nAs prostitution is legalized and regulated, there are no legal restrictions concerning sex dolls in [[Austria]] and numerous brothels are offering sex dolls for clients. Although sex dolls originally started appearing in Austria around 1980, they gained popularity in 2017 when a brothel started offering sex doll services to clients.<ref>[http://sexclubwien.com/breaking-news/brothel-vienna-started-using-sex-dolls/ Brothel Vienna started using sex dolls]</ref> This can be contributed to the fact that the dolls have become more realistic in recent years.\n\nIn addition to being able to have intercourse with the sex doll, some places allow clients to purchase sex dolls for themselves. One of the biggest laufhauses in [[Vienna]] offers sex in the [[laufhaus]] with dolls alongside real women.\n\nAccording to brothel owners who offer sex dolls, the dolls are being properly cleaned after every session. Unprotected sex with sex dolls is also allowed, but it is not advised as there is no guarantee that the dolls are being cleaned after each client.<ref>[http://brothelvienna.info/articles/sex-doll-brothels-becoming-more-popular/ Sex doll brothels becoming more popular]</ref>\n\n=== South Korea ===\nIn 2019 the South Korean Supreme Court ruled to legalize the sale of sex dolls.
