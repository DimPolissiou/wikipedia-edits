It was the oldest and most important of the five Greek cities in the region. It gave eastern Libya the classical name ''[[Cyrenaica]]'' that it has retained to modern times. Located nearby is the ancient [[Necropolis of Cyrene]].\n\nCyrene lies in a lush [[valley]] in the [[Jebel Akhdar (Libya)|Jebel Akhdar]] uplands. The city was named after a [[spring (hydrology)|spring]], Kyre, which the Greeks consecrated to [[Apollo]]. It was also the seat of the [[Cyrenaics]], a famous [[Greek philosophy|school of philosophy]] in the fourth century BC, founded by [[Aristippus]], a disciple of [[Socrates]].\n\n==History==\n\n=== Summary of the founding of Cyrene, as told by Herodotus ===\nGrinus, son of Aesanius a descendant of Theras, and king of the island of Thera, had visited the [[Pythia]], the [[oracle]] of [[Delphi]], and offered a [[hecatomb]] to the Pythia on sundry matters. The Pythia had offered the advice to found a new city in [[ancient Libya|Libya]].\n\nMany years passed and the advice was not taken, and Thera had succumbed to a horrific [[drought]] and all of the crops and trees had perished. They again sent to Delphi and were reminded that the Pythia had said several years before to settle in the country of Libya, but this time she specifically said to found a settlement in the land of [[Cyrenaica|Cyrene]].\n\nNot knowing how to get to Libya, they sent a messenger to [[Crete]] to find someone to lead them on their journey. They found a dealer in purple [[dye]]s named Corobius. He had once traveled to an island across from Libya called Platea [or Plataea, modern Jazirat Barda`ah].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.getamap.net/maps/libya/darnah/_plataea/ |title=Plat\u00e6a |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=Get A Map |access-date=23 Nov 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201031714/http://www.getamap.net/maps/libya/darnah/_plataea/ |archive-date=1 December 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Grinus and Corobius sailed to Platea, when they reached their destination they left Corobius with months of supplies and Grinus went back to Thera to collect men to settle the newly made colony. After two years of settling the [[colonies in antiquity#Greek colonies|colony]], they had little success and went back to the Pythia to get advice. The Pythia had repeated her advice to move directly to the country of Libya instead of across from Libya. So they moved to a place called Aziris. They settled there for six years, and were very successful until the Libyans visited the settlement of Aziris to convince the people to move further inland. They were swayed by the Libyans to move and settled into what is now Cyrene. The current king of that time Battus reigned for 40 years, until he passed on and his son, Arcesilaus, took over and reigned for 16 years, with no more or less population change until the Oracle had told the third king, another Battus, to bring [[Greeks|Greek]] citizens to the settlement and with that expansion the Libyans had lost a lot of land surrounding Cyrene.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/630cyrene.asp|title=Internet History Sourcebooks|website=sourcebooks.fordham.edu|access-date=2016-12-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203130152/http://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/630cyrene.asp|archive-date=2016-12-03|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Greek period===\n[[File:Temple of Zeus - Cyrene.jpg|thumb|The Temple of Zeus, Cyrene]]\nAccording to Greek tradition, Cyrene was founded in 631 BC as a settlement of Greeks from the island of [[Santorini|Thera]], traditionally led by [[Battus I of Cyrene|Battus I]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Osborne|first=Robin|year=2009|title=Greece in the Making: 1200\u2013479 BC|publisher=Routledge|location=London|page=8}}</ref> at a site {{convert|10|mi|km|order=flip}} from its associated port, [[Apollonia, Cyrenaica|Apollonia (Marsa Sousa)]].

Cyrene promptly became the chief town of Libya and established commercial relations with all the Greek cities, reaching the height of its prosperity under its own kings in the 5th century BC. Soon after 460 BC it became a [[republic]].

In 276 BC Magas crowned himself king and declared ''de facto'' independence, marrying the daughter of the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid emperor]] and forming with him an alliance in order to invade the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]].\n\nThe invasion was unsuccessful and in 250 BC, after Magas' death, the city was reabsorbed into Ptolemaic Egypt. [[Cyrenaica]] became part of the Ptolemaic empire controlled from Alexandria, and became Roman territory in 96 BC when [[Ptolemy Apion]] bequeathed Cyrenaica to [[Rome]]. In 74 BC the territory was formally transformed into a [[Roman province]].\n\n[[File:Apollo Kitharoidos BM 1380.jpg|right|thumb|[[Apollo of Cyrene|Apollo Kitharoidos]] from Cyrene.

In the [[Acts of the Apostles]] there is mention of people from Cyrene being in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.<ref>{{bibleverse||Acts|2:10|ESV}}</ref> According to the tradition of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]], its founder, [[Saint Mark]] was a native of Cyrene and ordained the first bishop of Cyrene. The [[Roman Martyrology]]<ref>''Martyrologium Romanum (Typographia Vaticana 2001 {{ISBN|978-88-209-7210-3}})</ref> mentions under 4 July a tradition that in the persecution of [[Diocletian]] a bishop Theodorus of Cyrene was scourged and had his tongue cut out. Earlier editions of the Martyrology mentioned what may be the same person also under 26 March. Letter 67 of [[Synesius]] tells of an irregular episcopal ordination carried out by a bishop Philo of Cyrene, which was condoned by [[Athanasius]]. The same letter mentions that a nephew of this Philo, who bore the same name, also became bishop of Cyrene. Although Cyrene was by then ruined, a bishop of Cyrene name Rufus was at the [[Robber Council of Ephesus]] in 449.

Cyrene, with its port of Apollonia (Marsa Susa), remained an important urban center until the [[earthquake]] of 262, which damaged the [[Extramural Sanctuary of Demeter and Persephone at Cyrene, Libya|Sanctuary of Demeter and Persephon]] in Cyrene. After the disaster, the emperor [[Claudius II|Claudius Gothicus]] restored Cyrene, naming it ''Claudiopolis'', but the restorations were poor and precarious. Natural catastrophes and a profound economic decline dictated its death, and in 365 another particularly devastating earthquake destroyed its already meager hopes of recovery. [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] described it in the 4th century as a deserted city, and [[Synesius]], a native of Cyrene, described it in the following century as a vast ruin at the mercy of the nomads. Ultimately, the city fell under [[Arab conquest]] in 643, by which time little was left of the opulent Roman cities of Northern Africa; the ruins of Cyrene are located near the modern village of [[Shahhat]].\n\n==Philosophy==\nCyrene contributed to the intellectual life of the Greeks, through renowned philosophers and mathematicians. Philosophy flourished at the Cyrenaican plateau, the School of Cyrene, known as [[Cyrenaics]] developed here, a minor [[Socratic method|Socratic]] school founded by [[Aristippus]] (perhaps the friend of [[Socrates]], though according to some accounts a grandson of Aristippus with the same name). French Neo-Epicurean philosopher [[Michel Onfray]] has called Cyrene \u201ca philosophical Atlantis\u201d thanks to its huge importance in the birth and initial development of pleasure ethics. \n\nCyrene was the birthplace of [[Eratosthenes]], who later went to [[Alexandria]]. Statues of philosophers, poets, and [[The Nine Muses]], and a bust of [[Demosthenes]] were found in Cyrene.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gB6DcMU94GUC&lpg=PA202&ots=V0GUyMv5Zr&dq=Cyrene%20Athens%20of%20Africa&pg=PA202#v=onepage&q=Cyrene%20Athens%20of%20Africa&f=false|title=Ancient Civilizations of Africa|year=1981|author=G.

It was the oldest and most important of the five Greek cities in the region. It gave eastern Libya the classical name ''[[Cyrenaica]]'' that it has retained to modern times. Located nearby is the ancient [[Necropolis of Cyrene]].\n\nCyrene lies in a lush [[valley]] in the [[Jebel Akhdar (Libya)|Jebel Akhdar]] uplands. The city was named after a [[spring (hydrology)|spring]], Kyre, which the Greeks consecrated to [[Apollo]]. It was also the seat of the [[Cyrenaics]], a famous [[Greek philosophy|school of philosophy]] in the fourth century BC, founded by [[Aristippus]], a disciple of [[Socrates]].\n\n==History==\n\n=== Summary of the founding of Cyrene, as told by Herodotus ===\nGrinus, son of Aesanius a descendant of Theras, and king of the island of Thera, had visited the [[Pythia]], the [[oracle]] of [[Delphi]], and offered a [[hecatomb]] to the Pythia on sundry matters. The Pythia had offered the advice to found a new city in [[ancient Libya|Libya]].\n\nMany years passed and the advice was not taken, and Thera had succumbed to a horrific [[drought]] and all of the crops and trees had perished. They again sent to Delphi and were reminded that the Pythia had said several years before to settle in the country of Libya, but this time she specifically said to found a settlement in the land of [[Cyrenaica|Cyrene]].\n\nNot knowing how to get to Libya, they sent a messenger to [[Crete]] to find someone to lead them on their journey. They found a dealer in purple [[dye]]s named Corobius. He had once traveled to an island across from Libya called Platea [or Plataea, modern Jazirat Barda`ah].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.getamap.net/maps/libya/darnah/_plataea/ |title=Plat\u00e6a |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=Get A Map |access-date=23 Nov 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201031714/http://www.getamap.net/maps/libya/darnah/_plataea/ |archive-date=1 December 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Grinus and Corobius sailed to Platea, when they reached their destination they left Corobius with months of supplies and Grinus went back to Thera to collect men to settle the newly made colony. After two years of settling the [[colonies in antiquity#Greek colonies|colony]], they had little success and went back to the Pythia to get advice. The Pythia had repeated her advice to move directly to the country of Libya instead of across from Libya. So they moved to a place called Aziris. They settled there for six years, and were very successful until the Libyans visited the settlement of Aziris to convince the people to move further inland. They were swayed by the Libyans to move and settled into what is now Cyrene. The current king of that time Battus reigned for 40 years, until he passed on and his son, Arcesilaus, took over and reigned for 16 years, with no more or less population change until the Oracle had told the third king, another Battus, to bring [[Greeks|Greek]] citizens to the settlement and with that expansion the Libyans had lost a lot of land surrounding Cyrene.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/630cyrene.asp|title=Internet History Sourcebooks|website=sourcebooks.fordham.edu|access-date=2016-12-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203130152/http://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/630cyrene.asp|archive-date=2016-12-03|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Greek period===\n[[File:Temple of Zeus - Cyrene.jpg|thumb|The Temple of Zeus, Cyrene]]\nAccording to Greek tradition, Cyrene was founded in 631 BC as a settlement of Greeks from the island of [[Santorini|Thera]], traditionally led by [[Battus I of Cyrene|Battus I]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Osborne|first=Robin|year=2009|title=Greece in the Making: 1200\u2013479 BC|publisher=Routledge|location=London|page=8}}</ref> at a site {{convert|10|mi|km|order=flip}} from its associated port, [[Apollonia, Cyrenaica|Apollonia (Marsa Sousa)]].

[[Cyrenaica]] became part of the Ptolemaic empire controlled from Alexandria, and became Roman territory in 96 BC when [[Ptolemy Apion]] bequeathed Cyrenaica to [[Rome]].

The same letter mentions that a nephew of this Philo, who bore the same name, also became bishop of Cyrene. Although Cyrene was by then ruined, a bishop of Cyrene name Rufus was at the [[Robber Council of Ephesus]] in 449.

Cyrene, with its port of Apollonia (Marsa Susa), remained an important urban center until the [[earthquake]] of 262, which damaged the [[Extramural Sanctuary of Demeter and Persephone at Cyrene, Libya|Sanctuary of Demeter and Persephon]] in Cyrene. After the disaster, the emperor [[Claudius II|Claudius Gothicus]] restored Cyrene, naming it ''Claudiopolis'', but the restorations were poor and precarious. Natural catastrophes and a profound economic decline dictated its death, and in 365 another particularly devastating earthquake destroyed its already meager hopes of recovery. [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] described it in the 4th century as a deserted city, and [[Synesius]], a native of Cyrene, described it in the following century as a vast ruin at the mercy of the nomads. Ultimately, the city fell under [[Arab conquest]] in 643, by which time little was left of the opulent Roman cities of Northern Africa; the ruins of Cyrene are located near the modern village of [[Shahhat]].\n\n==Philosophy==\nCyrene contributed to the intellectual life of the Greeks, through renowned philosophers and mathematicians. Philosophy flourished at the Cyrenaican plateau, the School of Cyrene, known as [[Cyrenaics]] developed here, a minor [[Socratic method|Socratic]] school founded by [[Aristippus]] (perhaps the friend of [[Socrates]], though according to some accounts a grandson of Aristippus with the same name). French Neo-Epicurean philosopher [[Michel Onfray]] has called Cyrene \u201ca philosophical Atlantis\u201d thanks to its huge importance in the birth and initial development of pleasure ethics. \n\nCyrene was the birthplace of [[Eratosthenes]], who later went to [[Alexandria]]. Statues of philosophers, poets, and [[The Nine Muses]], and a bust of [[Demosthenes]] were found in Cyrene.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gB6DcMU94GUC&lpg=PA202&ots=V0GUyMv5Zr&dq=Cyrene%20Athens%20of%20Africa&pg=PA202#v=onepage&q=Cyrene%20Athens%20of%20Africa&f=false|title=Ancient Civilizations of Africa|year=1981|author=G.

The book of 2 Maccabees itself is said by its author to be an abridgment of a five-volume work by a Hellenized Jew by the name of [[Jason of Cyrene]] who lived around 100 BC.\n\nCyrene is also mentioned in the [[New Testament]]. A Cyrenian named [[Simon of Cyrene|Simon]] carried the cross of [[Jesus Christ|Christ]] ([[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 15:21 and parallels). See also [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 2:10 where Jews from Cyrene heard the disciples speaking in their own language in Jerusalem on the day of [[Pentecost]]; 6:9 where some Cyrenian Jews disputed with a disciple named Stephen; 11:20 tells of Jewish Christians originally from Cyrene who (along with believers from Cyprus) first preached the Gospel to non-Jews; 13:1 names Lucius of Cyrene as one of several to whom the Holy Spirit spoke, instructing them to appoint Barnabas and Saul (later Paul) for missionary service.\n\n==Present==\n{{See also|Necropolis of Cyrene}}\nCyrene is now an archeological site near the village of [[Shahhat]]. One of its more significant features is the [[Greek temple|temple]] of [[Apollo]] see [[lists of temples in Libya]] which was originally constructed as early as 7th century BC. Other ancient structures include a temple to [[Demeter]] and a partially unexcavated temple to [[Zeus]] There is a large [[necropolis]] approximately 10&nbsp;km between Cyrene and its ancient port of Apollonia.
