Ricketts played more than 100 games for [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] in England, and has more than 100 appearances in Major League Soccer and has twice been named MLS Goalkeeper of the Year. He was also the captain of the [[Jamaica national football team]], earning 100 caps for his country, until his retirement from international football in 2013.\n\n==Club career==\n===Early career===\nRicketts attended Cornwall College High School where he played on the [[Dacosta Cup]] team. After high school, he played for teams such as [[Wadadah F.C.|Wadadah]], [[Seba United F.C.|Seba United]], Galaxy F.C. and [[Village United F.C.|Village United]] in his native Jamaica. Ricketts alerted English clubs after an impressive performance for Jamaica against Brazil, in a match played at Leicester City FC in 2003. A subsequent trial at Rushden & Diamonds FC \u2013 who already had fellow Reggae Boys' Onandi Lowe and Paul Hall in their ranks \u2013 did not result in a contract offer, and instead Ricketts signed for English Premier League side [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] in 2004.\n\n===Bradford City===\nRicketts never played a game at Bolton and instead moved to [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] initially on a year-long loan in July 2004.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://archive.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/2004/7/28/98706.html |title=Ricketts makes belated debut |date=28 July 2004 |accessdate=28 January 2008 |work=Telegraph & Argus |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416194434/http://archive.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/2004/7/28/98706.html |archivedate=16 April 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref> He spent most of his first season in English football as understudy to Australian [[Paul Henderson (footballer)|Paul Henderson]] before he finally made his debut in April 2005 and played in the final four games.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://archive.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/2005/4/14/91346.html |title=The number one choice |date=14 April 2005 |accessdate=28 January 2008 |work=Telegraph & Argus |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416194454/http://archive.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/2005/4/14/91346.html |archivedate=16 April 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref> During the season break he signed permanently on a two-year deal keeping him at City until 2007.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://archive.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/2005/11/26/182782.html |title=Ricketts has the safest hands in England |date=26 November 2005 |accessdate=28 January 2008 |work=Telegraph & Argus |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416194439/http://archive.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/2005/11/26/182782.html |archivedate=16 April 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref> He missed nine games because of a broken foot early in the [[2005-06 in English football|2005\u201306]] season and was replaced by [[Russell Howarth]].

June 1977) is a Jamaican [[association football|footballer]] who last played as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for [[FC Tulsa (USL)|Tulsa Roughnecks]] in the [[United Soccer League]]. Ricketts played more than 100 games for [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] in England, and has more than 100 appearances in Major League Soccer and has twice been named MLS Goalkeeper of the Year. He was also the captain of the [[Jamaica national football team]], earning 100 caps for his country, until his retirement from international football in 2013.\n\n==Club career==\n===Early career===\nRicketts attended Cornwall College High School where he played on the [[Dacosta Cup]] team. After high school, he played for teams such as [[Wadadah F.C.|Wadadah]], [[Seba United F.C.|Seba United]], Galaxy F.C. and [[Village United F.C.|Village United]] in his native Jamaica. Ricketts alerted English clubs after an impressive performance for Jamaica against Brazil, in a match played at Leicester City FC in 2003. A subsequent trial at Rushden & Diamonds FC \u2013 who already had fellow Reggae Boys' Onandi Lowe and Paul Hall in their ranks \u2013 did not result in a contract offer, and instead Ricketts signed for English Premier League side [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] in 2004.\n\n===Bradford City===\nRicketts never played a game at Bolton and instead moved to [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] initially on a year-long loan in July 2004.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://archive.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/2004/7/28/98706.html |title=Ricketts makes belated debut |date=28 July 2004 |accessdate=28 January 2008 |work=Telegraph & Argus |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416194434/http://archive.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/2004/7/28/98706.html |archivedate=16 April 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref> He spent most of his first season in English football as understudy to Australian [[Paul Henderson (footballer)|Paul Henderson]] before he finally made his debut in April 2005 and played in the final four games.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://archive.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/2005/4/14/91346.html |title=The number one choice |date=14 April 2005 |accessdate=28 January 2008 |work=Telegraph & Argus |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416194454/http://archive.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/2005/4/14/91346.html |archivedate=16 April 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref> During the season break he signed permanently on a two-year deal keeping him at City until 2007.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://archive.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/2005/11/26/182782.html |title=Ricketts has the safest hands in England |date=26 November 2005 |accessdate=28 January 2008 |work=Telegraph & Argus |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416194439/http://archive.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/2005/11/26/182782.html |archivedate=16 April 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref> He missed nine games because of a broken foot early in the [[2005-06 in English football|2005\u201306]] season and was replaced by [[Russell Howarth]].

Saunders filled in well, considering Ricketts started most of the games in the '09 season, but it was not enough to fend off [[Real Salt Lake]], who won via [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalties]].  In 2010, Ricketts was named ''MLS Goalkeeper of the Year''.

Female brown anoles can be distinguished by a light brown stripe that runs over their back, a feature that males lack.\n{{Clear}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"130\">\nFile:Brown Anole - Anolis Sagrei, by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Trudeau.jpg|Male extending dewlap\nFile:Brown Anole, Florida.jpg|[[Florida]] female\nFile:Closeupanole.jpg|Female\nFile:Cuban brown anole (Anolis sagrei sagrei) juvenile.JPG|[[Grand Cayman]] juvenile\nFile:Brown anole.png|Male extending his dewlap in [[Citrus County, Florida]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Life cycle==\nBrown anoles live on average 4-5 years in the wild but have been known to survive up to 8 years in captivity, though reaching this age is uncommon.  They reach sexual maturity one year after hatching, and typically breed in the summer months (depending on the climate) from March-April to August-September. After breeding, the female will lay 1-2 eggs every 7-14 days, burying and then abandoning them.  If viable, the eggs will hatch about seven weeks later, and the hatchlings that survive do so entirely on instinct.\n\n==Shedding==\nBrown anoles [[molt]] in small pieces, unlike some other [[reptile]]s, which molt in one large piece. Anoles may consume the molted [[skin]] to replenish supplies of [[calcium]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Brown Anole |url=http://www.animalspot.net/brown-anole.html |publisher=Animal Spot |accessdate=2017-12-06}}</ref> In captivity, the molted skin may stick to the anole if [[humidity]] is too low. The unshed layer of skin can build up around the [[eye]]s, preventing the lizard from feeding and may lead to [[starvation]]. This can be prevented by maintaining high humidity.\n\n==Diet==\nBrown anoles feed on small [[arthropod]]s such as [[Cricket (insect)|crickets]], [[moth]]s, ants, [[grasshopper]]s, [[cockroach]]es, [[mealworm]]s, [[spider]]s, and [[waxworm]]s. They may also eat other lizards, such as [[skink]]s and the [[Carolina anole]], lizard [[Egg (biology)|egg]]s, and their own molted skin and detached tails. If near water, they eat aquatic arthropods or small [[fish]] \u2013 nearly anything that will fit in their mouths.\n[[File:Brown anole .jpg|alt=brownanoletexas|thumb|Brown anole in [[Rockport, Texas|Rockport]], Texas]]\n\n==Predation==\nAs a defense mechanism, the brown anole can detach most of its tail when pursued or captured. The piece that breaks off will continue to move, possibly distracting the predator and allowing the anole to escape. The lost tail will partially regrow.<ref>Casanova, L. (2004). ''Norops sagrei'' (On-line), [http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Norops_sagrei.html Animal Diversity Web]. Accessed July 31, 2008</ref> If provoked, the brown anole will bite, urinate, and defecate. Also some brown anoles may do a short hiss if caught, injured, or fighting. Predators include [[rat]]s, [[snake]]s, [[bird]]s and many larger animals such as cats.\n\nRecent work in experimentally introduced populations in the Bahamas has shown that body size in the brown anole may not be affected by predation, as was previously thought.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Calsbeek | first1 = R. | last2 = Cox | first2 = R.M. | year = 2010 | title = Experimentally assessing the relative importance of predation and competition as agents of selection | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 465 | issue = 7298| pages = 613\u2013616 | doi=10.1038/nature09020 | pmid=20453837| bibcode = 2010Natur.465..613C }}</ref>\n\n==Communication==\nAnoles use visual cues as their primary signaling mode.<ref>Losos J.B. 2009.

Female brown anoles can be distinguished by a light brown stripe that runs over their back, a feature that males lack.\n{{Clear}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"130\">\nFile:Brown Anole - Anolis Sagrei, by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Trudeau.jpg|Male extending dewlap\nFile:Brown Anole, Florida.jpg|[[Florida]] female\nFile:Closeupanole.jpg|Female\nFile:Cuban brown anole (Anolis sagrei sagrei) juvenile.JPG|[[Grand Cayman]] juvenile\nFile:Brown anole.png|Male extending his dewlap in [[Citrus County, Florida]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Life cycle==\nBrown anoles live on average 4-5 years in the wild but have been known to survive up to 8 years in captivity, though reaching this age is uncommon.  They reach sexual maturity one year after hatching, and typically breed in the summer months (depending on the climate) from March-April to August-September. After breeding, the female will lay 1-2 eggs every 7-14 days, burying and then abandoning them.  If viable, the eggs will hatch about seven weeks later, and the hatchlings that survive do so entirely on instinct.\n\n==Shedding==\nBrown anoles [[molt]] in small pieces, unlike some other [[reptile]]s, which molt in one large piece. Anoles may consume the molted [[skin]] to replenish supplies of [[calcium]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Brown Anole |url=http://www.animalspot.net/brown-anole.html |publisher=Animal Spot |accessdate=2017-12-06}}</ref> In captivity, the molted skin may stick to the anole if [[humidity]] is too low. The unshed layer of skin can build up around the [[eye]]s, preventing the lizard from feeding and may lead to [[starvation]]. This can be prevented by maintaining high humidity.\n\n==Diet==\nBrown anoles feed on small [[arthropod]]s such as [[Cricket (insect)|crickets]], [[moth]]s, ants, [[grasshopper]]s, [[cockroach]]es, [[mealworm]]s, [[spider]]s, and [[waxworm]]s. They may also eat other lizards, such as [[skink]]s and the [[Carolina anole]], lizard [[Egg (biology)|egg]]s, and their own molted skin and detached tails. If near water, they eat aquatic arthropods or small [[fish]] \u2013 nearly anything that will fit in their mouths.\n[[File:Brown anole .jpg|alt=brownanoletexas|thumb|Brown anole in [[Rockport, Texas|Rockport]], Texas]]\n\n==Predation==\nAs a defense mechanism, the brown anole can detach most of its tail when pursued or captured. The piece that breaks off will continue to move, possibly distracting the predator and allowing the anole to escape. The lost tail will partially regrow.<ref>Casanova, L. (2004).

Predators include [[rat]]s, [[snake]]s, [[bird]]s and many larger animals such as cats.\n\nRecent work in experimentally introduced populations in the Bahamas has shown that body size in the brown anole may not be affected by predation, as was previously thought.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Calsbeek | first1 = R. | last2 = Cox | first2 = R.M. | year = 2010 | title = Experimentally assessing the relative importance of predation and competition as agents of selection | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 465 | issue = 7298| pages = 613\u2013616 | doi=10.1038/nature09020 | pmid=20453837| bibcode = 2010Natur.465..613C }}</ref>\n\n==Communication==\nAnoles use visual cues as their primary signaling mode.<ref>Losos J.B. 2009.

The series, often told from multiple [[Narrative mode|points of view]], is mostly set within a fictional United States during various time periods, most notably the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition era]]. It focuses on various people, including [[Alchemy|alchemists]], thieves, thugs, [[American mafia|Mafiosi]] and [[Camorra|Camorristi]], who are unconnected to one another. After an [[Elixir of life|immortality elixir]] is recreated in 1930 [[Manhattan]], the characters begin to cross paths, setting off events that spiral further and further out of control.\n\nThe first novel was released in February 2003 under [[ASCII Media Works]]' (formerly [[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]) [[Dengeki Bunko]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]], twenty-two novels have so far been released. The novels were adapted into a sixteen episode [[anime]] television series directed by [[Takahiro Omori]] and produced by [[Brain's Base]] and [[Aniplex]].</onlyinclude> The first thirteen episodes were aired on [[WOWOW]] from July 26, 2007, to November 1, 2007; the final three were released [[Direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]]. The series was also adapted into a two-volume [[manga]], an [[adventure game|adventure]] video game for the [[Nintendo DS]] and two [[Radio drama in Japan|drama CDs]]. An additional novel was released with the first drama CD and two ''[[gaiden]]'' novels were released in parts with the DVDs of the anime adaption.\n\n[[Funimation]] has dubbed the anime episodes in English, and has licensed them for release in the United States and Canada. The series was also licensed by [[Manga Entertainment]] for English releases in the United Kingdom, and by [[Madman Entertainment]] for releases in Australia and New Zealand. The entire English-dubbed series was streamed through [[Hulu]] during October 2009 and English-subtitled episodes continue to be streamed. Funimation streams English-subtitled and English-dubbed episodes through their website. The series has also aired in the Philippines, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia on [[Animax Asia]]. On January 25, 2016, it was announced that the streaming and DVD home distribution rights for the North American distributor of the anime, Funimation, would expire, which occurred on February 8, 2016.<ref name=\"FunimationLicenseExpire\">{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/daily-briefs/2016-01-26/funimation-baccano-license-to-expire-in-february/.97968|title=Funimation's Baccano!

The first light novel, ''The Rolling Bootlegs'', was awarded the Gold Prize of the ninth [[Dengeki Novel Prize]], held by ASCII Media Works in 2002, after reaching third place. The anime adaptation of the series has been popular in Japan and the United States, and has also received significant praise for its plot, characters, strong dubbing, animation and musical score.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{main|List of Baccano! characters}}\n\nBelow is a summary for the past twenty-two volumes in chronological order.\n\nAboard the ship ''Advenna Avis'' in 1711, a group of [[alchemist]]s summon a demon in the hopes of gaining eternal life. The demon gives them an [[elixir of life|elixir of immortality]] and the method of ending their existence, by \"devouring\" one another, and grants the summoner Maiza Avaro the formula of the elixir. Maiza and most of the alchemists decide that no one else must become immortal; only Szilard Quates opposes. That night, the alchemists begin to disappear, devoured by Szilard. Realizing the threat posed by staying together, they scatter across the globe.\n\nIn New York City during November 1930, Szilard succeeds in recreating the elixir, only to have it stolen by young thug Dallas Genoard. The elixir continually moves around the city because of Dallas, with the three [[American mafia|mafiosi]] Gandor brothers, the two idiotic thieves Isaac Dian and Miria Harvent, and Maiza's protege Firo Prochainezo and their [[Camorra]] family, the Martillo, all passing it around. Szilard makes Dallas an incomplete immortal (meaning he still ages) to retrieve the elixir. However, all other parties accidentally consume the elixir, mistaking it for alcohol, at a party for Firo. Firo falls in love with Szilard's immortal [[homunculus]] Ennis, who betrays Szilard by telling Firo how to devour Szilard, which he does. The Gandor then cement Dallas to a barrel at the bottom of the [[Hudson River]] to punish him for killing Gandor members.\n\nIn late 1931, the Gandor fight the Runorata family for control of the same area after a new drug surfaces. In an attempt to resolve the situation, Luck Gandor asks his adoptive brother Claire Stanfield, a psychopathic assassin and train conductor, to travel to New York. Claire agrees to, and as a conductor, boards the [[Transcontinental railroad|transcontinental train]] the ''Flying Pussyfoot''. The train is hijacked by the Russo and Lemure gangs, who are trying to kidnap a senator's family, and a battle ensues between the two gangs. Jacuzzi Splot, Nice Holystone and their gang attempt to protect the passengers and fight the hijackers, while Claire assumes the identity of the Rail Tracer, a monster that eats train passengers, and slaughters much of the Russo and the Lemure.  During a confrontation between Ladd Russo and Chane Laforet and the Lemure, Claire interrupts and proposes to Chane Laforet, who is the daughter of Huey Laforet, one of the original immortals aboard the ''Advenna Avis''. A serial stowaway and newspaper field agent named Rachel flees Claire and ends up helping in the rescue of the hostages. The last remaining members of the Lemure are eventually defeated by Jacuzzi's gang, while sadistic murderer Ladd Russo is incarcerated and loses his arm to Claire. At the same time, Ennis writes to Isaac and Miria, inviting them to Manhattan. The duo boards the same train and meets Jacuzzi, and unwittingly sway immortal Czeslaw Meyer from enacting malevolent acts via bombs to be used in the New York Drug War.\n\nThe train arrives in New Year 1932 with the survivors going their separate ways: Jacuzzi and Nice escape custody and go into hiding after their base of operations in Chicago was taken over by the Russo family; information gatherer Rachel returns to the Daily Days mostly unscathed; Isaac and Miria introduce Czes to the Martillo family and is subsequently adopted by Firo and Ennis, who later marry, as the latter's brother; and Claire begins his mission to exterminate the enemies of his adoptive brothers, with his intentions to find Chane and marry her after the job is done.\n\nLater that year in 1932, Dallas' sister Eve searches for Dallas, putting her at odds with the Gandor family. These stories involved the Daily Days News Information company and the Runorattas' drug plot with Begg, a drug addicted immortal alchemist acquaintance of Maiza's encroaching Gandor turf through his miracle drugs, testing it on innocent bystanders including a young man named Roy Maddock. Eventually Eve is caught up in the turf war involving drugs with the Runoratta family and Gandors, the ramifications of the turf war affecting two lovers: Gandor speakeasy waitress Edith and her boyfriend, revealed to be Roy. The climax of the conflict results in Luck secretly telling Eve where Dallas is to spare her from bloodshed, and with Claire's help, the turf war ends with bittersweet results for Edith and Roy now associated with the Gandors until they finish the debt they compiled in the story albeit in happier terms.\n\nEventually in 1933, Dallas is pulled out of the river, but shortly after, he is abducted by the Larvae, a group working for Huey Laforet. Meanwhile, Jacuzzi's operations begin to encroach on Gandor and Martillo turf. Representatives (Ronnie Schiatto, Ennis, Maria Barcelito and Tick Jefferson) from both groups converge on Eve's home, where his gang is staying along with Isaac and Miria. At the same time, the Larvae arrive to enlist Jacuzzi's help; they have kidnapped Dallas to prove that immortality is possible, and attempt to convince Jacuzzi into join them however it devolves into an incident at the mansion, forcing both parties to temporarily retreat and attract the attention of Claire after hearing Chane was injured in the batted. Their conflict reaches a prominent building in New York called Mist Wall, the largest branch office of the military equipment researcher and developer Nebula, is bombed according to Huey's plan but mitigated by the intervention of various parties involved. The gangs avert further catastrophe by stopping the Larvae group and with Tick Jefferson making amends with Larvae leader Tim, revealed to be his lost younger brother before once again going their separate ways.\n\nThe next year in 1934 at [[Alcatraz Island]], Ladd Russo befriends Firo, who was framed by fellow Immortal Victor Talbot for the Mist Wall public bombing and Isaac, who was finally caught for his thefts, leaving Miria morose from his arrest. All three men meet Huey Laforet in separate occasions, who was charged with [[treason]] and [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] years ago with affiliation to the Lemures among other terrorist acts. Meanwhile, Christopher Shouldered, Huey's homunculus, and Graham Specter, Ladd's loyal follower, cause an all out war in [[Chicago]] through various battles enacted by the Lamia, Nebula and the Russo family led by a now immortal Placido Russo with each battling for their lives. Afterwards, Jacuzzi and his gang return to Chicago while Ladd attempts to kill Huey and fails thanks to the efforts of Isaac, Firo and Chane's homunculus sister, Leeza Laforet; however, the scuffle resulted in Huey's eye taken with the help of Lamia operative Sham, a homunculus who can take over one's consciousness by contact through his body in the form of water. The homunculus group Lamia (associated with Larvae, the group previously encountered by the cast in 1933) cause trouble for the Russo family while this happens. Several of the Lamia join their forces and others split after the conflict, particularly Christopher joining with the Russo family to protect the androgynous heir Ricardo Russo along with Lamia member Sickle and Graham Spector. Isaac is eventually released from Alcatraz along with Firo after fulfilling their mission. Placido Russo, Ricardo's grandfather and Ladd's uncle, is eventually turned immortal and consumed by Nebula scientist Renee for his failure in stopping the rampage of Chicago, resulting in Ricardo inheriting the crime family.\n\nThe remainder of the plot focuses of an even older faction of Immortals led by Huey's mentor and former lover, Renee Paramedes Branvillier detailed their relationship with the 1711 immortals from the 1700s till the later 1930s and how the corporation Nebula involves themselves against the other crime families by allying themselves with Senator Manfred Beriam, who bears malevolent grudges against immortals.\n\nIn 1935, One particular immortal named Melvi targets Firo in by manipulating the entire cast to partake in a high stakes casino royale party in a newly established building called Ra's Lance run by various Mafia families, however many other characters have various agendas that threatens his plan. He intends to endanger Ennis in order to extract the memories of Szilard Quaites by eating Firo, unaware that his bodyguard is Claire Stanfield, resulting in his defeat. Later, Renee continues to pursue Huey by attempting to reclaim their daughter Chane for an experiment which put her at odds with Claire who intends to marry their daughter. As of this writing, the conflict remains unresolved\n\nIn 2001, Maiza and a few immortals appear in a rural European town to apprehend a fellow alchemist and immortal Elmer C. Albatross, who had been masquerading as a demon and was imprisoned by the locals. They uncover an age old conspiracy detailing the origins of water homunculi from the 1930s (Sham and Leeza Laforet, sister of Chane) and also putting a stop the experiments on the people that had been ongoing in the town as they remained unaware of Szilard Quaite's demise for almost the remaining century, his descendant Bild Quaites later encounters the immortals and reveals the horrific secrets of the village. Phil and Felt Nebil, homunculi resulting from Szilard's experiments are subsequently freed from the village and allowed to wander the earth, ending up in New York after the ordeal.\n\nIn 2002, a cult named SAMPLE launches a heist to replicate the Flying Pussyfoot incident via a twin cruise ship named Exit and Entrance only to be thwarted by Claire Stanfield and Chane Laforet's descendants, Claudia and Charon Walken with Jaccuzi Splot and Nice Holystone's descendant, Bobby Splot along with his gang with unwitting aide from another faction called Mask Makers led by Huey's descendant Luchino B. Campanella. It is eventually revealed that Czes's tormentor Fermet is in fact the mastermind and overall villain of the series after Szilard Quates.\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Grand Central Station Main Concourse Jan 2006.jpg|thumb|left|300px|alt=People walk through a large symmetrical room as an American flag hangs vertically at the center of the far wall.|To portray Manhattan accurately, Ito Satoshi, [[art director]] of the anime series, visited locations such as [[Grand Central Terminal]].]]\n\n[[Ryohgo Narita]] wanted to write a story set during the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] and chose a light novel as the medium because not many of them had that setting. He believed that this choice would better attract the interest of the [[ASCII Media Works]] judges. After Narita saw ''[[The Untouchables (film)|The Untouchables]]'', he spent about ten days working with inspirations and created ''Baccano!'' \"out of [his] useless calculations.\" While writing the first novel ''The Rolling Bootlegs'', he consulted many books while writing and mixed fictional elements with historical situations to create a unique plot flow. The story he originally planned was about an ancient magician who was revived during the Prohibition and began to terrorize New York City. A group of mafiosi then violently oppose the magician. However, the story became very different from the original concept. Narita never wrote a detailed outline for the novel and is relieved by that fact because it allowed the characters to \"move on their own.\" The original stages of the series included more supernatural elements. Maiza Avaro was a [[hypnosis|hypnotist]]; Ennis was a [[succubus]]; Szilard was a magician. In addition, every member of the Camorra, except for Firo, did not survive. Despite the great differences between the characters' initial concepts and the result, Narita is \"glad\" that these ideas were not used in the finished novel.<ref name=\"RollingBootlegsAfterword\">{{cite book|last=Narita|first=Ryohgo|others=illus.

After his graduation, he was offered to publish his next book in August, and he submitted his manuscripts in late April, a bit behind original deadlines. He had written over 400 pages, making the price over [[Japanese yen|\u00a5]]700, which is a high price for a novel written by a newcomer. This worried Narita because it was unlikely anyone would buy the novel. As a result, he and his chief editor decided that the novel would be released in two parts. However, Narita was still anxious about publishing such a long novel.<ref name=\"GrandPunkRailroadLocalAfterword\">{{cite book|last=Narita|first=Ryohgo|others=illus.

As with the first novel, the plot changed because of the characters' \"movements\", most notably Claire Stanfield. Narita noted that all of the Lemure and Russo, with the exception of a character named Neider, were originally planned to die, but Claire's presence in the novel left that concept \"in ruins\". In addition, Chane Laforet, who was not well liked by the author, was also supposed to die, but as time passed, Narita became attached to her and changed her fate.<ref name=\"GrandPunkRailroadExpressAfterword\">{{cite book|last=Narita|first=Ryohgo|others=illus.

Walker states that this is probably the longest casting process [[Funimation]] has held. He comments that because there are a lot of characters and most of them are older men, a character type he does not work with often, choosing voice actors and familiarizing them with their characters was difficult. He asked many directors and actors for recommendations and mainly aimed to cast newcomers, as he felt ''Baccano!'' provided him a chance to discover newer talent. Walker wished to find actors who could provide the dialect and accents of the various time periods and locations, especially when casting for the characters with heavy European accents.<ref name=\"AnimeTodayTylerWalker\">{{cite video |date = December 5, 2008 |title = Anime Today Talks Baccano!

He attempted to take what he could from ''The Untouchables'', especially [[Robert De Niro]]'s portrayal of [[Al Capone]]. Walker watched movies created and set in the 1930s, including but not limited to ''[[The Public Enemy]]'',  ''[[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]]'', ''[[Once Upon a Time in America]]'',  ''[[Miller's Crossing]]'' and various movies starring [[James Cagney]], because he believed they would give him a truer feel on how people of the era sounded and talked. He wanted to capture the lingo and rhythm. Because ''Baccano!'' is a \"stylized gangster flick\" and because of the nature of anime, he made the dialogue  more flowery and lingo-ridden than it would have been in reality.<ref name=\"AnimeTodayTylerWalker\"/>\n\n== Media ==\n\n=== Light novels ===\n{{Main|List of Baccano! light novels}}\nThe ''Baccano!''

The series, often told from multiple [[Narrative mode|points of view]], is mostly set within a fictional United States during various time periods, most notably the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition era]]. It focuses on various people, including [[Alchemy|alchemists]], thieves, thugs, [[American mafia|Mafiosi]] and [[Camorra|Camorristi]], who are unconnected to one another. After an [[Elixir of life|immortality elixir]] is recreated in 1930 [[Manhattan]], the characters begin to cross paths, setting off events that spiral further and further out of control.\n\nThe first novel was released in February 2003 under [[ASCII Media Works]]' (formerly [[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]) [[Dengeki Bunko]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]], twenty-two novels have so far been released. The novels were adapted into a sixteen episode [[anime]] television series directed by [[Takahiro Omori]] and produced by [[Brain's Base]] and [[Aniplex]].</onlyinclude> The first thirteen episodes were aired on [[WOWOW]] from July 26, 2007, to November 1, 2007; the final three were released [[Direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]]. The series was also adapted into a two-volume [[manga]], an [[adventure game|adventure]] video game for the [[Nintendo DS]] and two [[Radio drama in Japan|drama CDs]]. An additional novel was released with the first drama CD and two ''[[gaiden]]'' novels were released in parts with the DVDs of the anime adaption.\n\n[[Funimation]] has dubbed the anime episodes in English, and has licensed them for release in the United States and Canada. The series was also licensed by [[Manga Entertainment]] for English releases in the United Kingdom, and by [[Madman Entertainment]] for releases in Australia and New Zealand. The entire English-dubbed series was streamed through [[Hulu]] during October 2009 and English-subtitled episodes continue to be streamed. Funimation streams English-subtitled and English-dubbed episodes through their website. The series has also aired in the Philippines, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia on [[Animax Asia]].

The first light novel, ''The Rolling Bootlegs'', was awarded the Gold Prize of the ninth [[Dengeki Novel Prize]], held by ASCII Media Works in 2002, after reaching third place. The anime adaptation of the series has been popular in Japan and the United States, and has also received significant praise for its plot, characters, strong dubbing, animation and musical score.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{main|List of Baccano! characters}}\n\nBelow is a summary for the past twenty-two volumes in chronological order. \n\nAboard the ship ''Advenna Avis'' in 1711, a group of [[alchemist]]s summon a demon in the hopes of gaining eternal life. The demon gives them an [[elixir of life|elixir of immortality]] and the method of ending their existence, by \"devouring\" one another, and grants the summoner Maiza Avaro the formula of the elixir. Maiza and most of the alchemists decide that no one else must become immortal; only Szilard Quates opposes. That night, the alchemists begin to disappear, devoured by Szilard. Realizing the threat posed by staying together, they scatter across the globe.\n\nIn New York City during November 1930, Szilard succeeds in recreating the elixir, only to have it stolen by young thug Dallas Genoard. The elixir continually moves around the city because of Dallas, with the three [[American mafia|mafiosi]] Gandor brothers, the two idiotic thieves Isaac Dian and Miria Harvent, and Maiza's protege Firo Prochainezo and their [[Camorra]] family, the Martillo, all passing it around. Szilard makes Dallas an incomplete immortal (meaning he still ages) to retrieve the elixir. However, all other parties accidentally consume the elixir, mistaking it for alcohol, at a party for Firo. Firo falls in love with Szilard's immortal [[homunculus]] Ennis, who betrays Szilard by telling Firo how to devour Szilard, which he does. The Gandor then cement Dallas to a barrel at the bottom of the [[Hudson River]] to punish him for killing Gandor members.\n\nIn late 1931, the Gandor fight the Runorata family for control of the same area after a new drug surfaces. In an attempt to resolve the situation, Luck Gandor asks his adoptive brother Claire Stanfield, a psychopathic assassin and train conductor, to travel to New York. Claire agrees to, and as a conductor, boards the [[Transcontinental railroad|transcontinental train]] the ''Flying Pussyfoot''. The train is hijacked by the Russo and Lemure gangs, who are trying to kidnap a senator's family, and a battle ensues between the two gangs. Jacuzzi Splot, Nice Holystone and their gang attempt to protect the passengers and fight the hijackers, while Claire assumes the identity of the Rail Tracer, a monster that eats train passengers, and slaughters much of the Russo and the Lemure.  During a confrontation between Ladd Russo and Chane Laforet and the Lemure, Claire interrupts and proposes to Chane Laforet, who is the daughter of Huey Laforet, one of the original immortals aboard the ''Advenna Avis''. A serial stowaway and newspaper field agent named Rachel flees Claire and ends up helping in the rescue of the hostages. The last remaining members of the Lemure are eventually defeated by Jacuzzi's gang, while sadistic murderer Ladd Russo is incarcerated and loses his arm to Claire. At the same time, Ennis writes to Isaac and Miria, inviting them to Manhattan. The duo boards the same train and meets Jacuzzi, and unwittingly sway immortal Czeslaw Meyer from enacting malevolent acts via bombs to be used in the New York Drug War.\n\nThe train arrives in New Year 1932 with the survivors going their separate ways: Jacuzzi and Nice escape custody and go into hiding after their base of operations in Chicago was taken over by the Russo family; information gatherer Rachel returns to the Daily Days mostly unscathed; Isaac and Miria introduce Czes to the Martillo family and is subsequently adopted by Firo and Ennis, who later marry, as the latter's brother; and Claire begins his mission to exterminate the enemies of his adoptive brothers, with his intentions to find Chane and marry her after the job is done.\n\nLater that year in 1932, Dallas' sister Eve searches for Dallas, putting her at odds with the Gandor family. These stories involved the Daily Days News Information company and the Runorattas' drug plot with Begg, a drug addicted immortal alchemist acquaintance of Maiza's encroaching Gandor turf through his miracle drugs, testing it on innocent bystanders including a young man named Roy Maddock. Eventually Eve is caught up in the turf war involving drugs with the Runoratta family and Gandors, the ramifications of the turf war affecting two lovers: Gandor speakeasy waitress Edith and her boyfriend, revealed to be Roy. The climax of the conflict results in Luck secretly telling Eve where Dallas is to spare her from bloodshed, and with Claire's help, the turf war ends with bittersweet results for Edith and Roy now associated with the Gandors until they finish the debt they compiled in the story albeit in happier terms.\n\nEventually in 1933, Dallas is pulled out of the river, but shortly after, he is abducted by the Larvae, a group working for Huey Laforet. Meanwhile, Jacuzzi's operations begin to encroach on Gandor and Martillo turf. Representatives (Ronnie Schiatto, Ennis, Maria Barcelito and Tick Jefferson) from both groups converge on Eve's home, where his gang is staying along with Isaac and Miria. At the same time, the Larvae arrive to enlist Jacuzzi's help; they have kidnapped Dallas to prove that immortality is possible, and attempt to convince Jacuzzi into join them however it devolves into an incident at the mansion, forcing both parties to temporarily retreat and attract the attention of Claire after hearing Chane was injured in the batted. Their conflict reaches a prominent building in New York called Mist Wall, the largest branch office of the military equipment researcher and developer Nebula, is bombed according to Huey's plan but mitigated by the intervention of various parties involved. The gangs avert further catastrophe by stopping the Larvae group and with Tick Jefferson making amends with Larvae leader Tim, revealed to be his lost younger brother before once again going their separate ways. \n\nThe next year in 1934 at [[Alcatraz Island]], Ladd Russo befriends Firo, who was framed by fellow Immortal Victor Talbot for the Mist Wall public bombing and Isaac, who was finally caught for his thefts, leaving Miria morose from his arrest. All three men meet Huey Laforet in separate occasions, who was charged with [[treason]] and [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] years ago with affiliation to the Lemures among other terrorist acts. Meanwhile, Christopher Shouldered, Huey's homunculus, and Graham Specter, Ladd's loyal follower, cause an all out war in [[Chicago]] through various battles enacted by the Lamia, Nebula and the Russo family led by a now immortal Placido Russo with each battling for their lives. Afterwards, Jacuzzi and his gang return to Chicago while Ladd attempts to kill Huey and fails thanks to the efforts of Isaac, Firo and Chane's homunculus sister, Leeza Laforet; however, the scuffle resulted in Huey's eye taken with the help of Lamia operative Sham, a homunculus who can take over one's consciousness by contact through his body in the form of water. The homunculus group Lamia (associated with Larvae, the group previously encountered by the cast in 1933) cause trouble for the Russo family while this happens. Several of the Lamia join their forces and others split after the conflict, particularly Christopher joining with the Russo family to protect the androgynous heir Ricardo Russo along with Lamia member Sickle and Graham Spector. Isaac is eventually released from Alcatraz along with Firo after fulfilling their mission. Placido Russo, Ricardo's grandfather and Ladd's uncle, is eventually turned immortal and consumed by Nebula scientist Renee for his failure in stopping the rampage of Chicago, resulting in Ricardo inheriting the crime family.\n\nThe remainder of the plot focuses of an even older faction of Immortals led by Huey's mentor and former lover, Renee Paramedes Branvillier detailed their relationship with the 1711 immortals from the 1700s till the later 1930s and how the corporation Nebula involves themselves against the other crime families by allying themselves with Senator Manfred Beriam, who bears malevolent grudges against immortals. \n\nIn 1935, One particular immortal named Melvi targets Firo in by manipulating the entire cast to partake in a high stakes casino royale party in a newly established building called Ra's Lance run by various Mafia families, however many other characters have various agendas that threatens his plan. He intends to endanger Ennis in order to extract the memories of Szilard Quaites by eating Firo, unaware that his bodyguard is Claire Stanfield, resulting in his defeat. Later, Renee continues to pursue Huey by attempting to reclaim their daughter Chane for an experiment which put her at odds with Claire who intends to marry their daughter. As of this writing, the conflict remains unresolved\n\nIn 2001, Maiza and a few immortals appear in a rural European town to apprehend a fellow alchemist and immortal Elmer C. Albatross, who had been masquerading as a demon and was imprisoned by the locals. They uncover an age old conspiracy detailing the origins of water homunculi from the 1930s (Sham and Leeza Laforet, sister of Chane) and also putting a stop the experiments on the people that had been ongoing in the town as they remained unaware of Szilard Quaite's demise for almost the remaining century, his descendant Bild Quaites later encounters the immortals and reveals the horrific secrets of the village. Phil and Felt Nebil, homunculi resulting from Szilard's experiments are subsequently freed from the village and allowed to wander the earth, ending up in New York after the ordeal.\n\nIn 2002, a cult named SAMPLE launches a heist to replicate the Flying Pussyfoot incident via a twin cruise ship named Exit and Entrance only to be thwarted by Claire Stanfield and Chane Laforet's descendants, Claudia and Charon Walken with Jaccuzi Splot and Nice Holystone's descendant, Bobby Splot along with his gang with unwitting aide from another faction called Mask Makers led by Huey's descendant Luchino B. Campanella. It is eventually revealed that Czes's tormentor Fermet is in fact the mastermind and overall villain of the series after Szilard Quates.\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Grand Central Station Main Concourse Jan 2006.jpg|thumb|left|300px|alt=People walk through a large symmetrical room as an American flag hangs vertically at the center of the far wall.|To portray Manhattan accurately, Ito Satoshi, [[art director]] of the anime series, visited locations such as [[Grand Central Terminal]].]]\n\n[[Ryohgo Narita]] wanted to write a story set during the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] and chose a light novel as the medium because not many of them had that setting. He believed that this choice would better attract the interest of the [[ASCII Media Works]] judges. After Narita saw ''[[The Untouchables (film)|The Untouchables]]'', he spent about ten days working with inspirations and created ''Baccano!'' \"out of [his] useless calculations.\" While writing the first novel ''The Rolling Bootlegs'', he consulted many books while writing and mixed fictional elements with historical situations to create a unique plot flow. The story he originally planned was about an ancient magician who was revived during the Prohibition and began to terrorize New York City. A group of mafiosi then violently oppose the magician. However, the story became very different from the original concept. Narita never wrote a detailed outline for the novel and is relieved by that fact because it allowed the characters to \"move on their own.\" The original stages of the series included more supernatural elements. Maiza Avaro was a [[hypnosis|hypnotist]]; Ennis was a [[succubus]]; Szilard was a magician. In addition, every member of the Camorra, except for Firo, did not survive. Despite the great differences between the characters' initial concepts and the result, Narita is \"glad\" that these ideas were not used in the finished novel.<ref name=\"RollingBootlegsAfterword\">{{cite book|last=Narita|first=Ryohgo|others=illus.

After his graduation, he was offered to publish his next book in August, and he submitted his manuscripts in late April, a bit behind original deadlines. He had written over 400 pages, making the price over [[Japanese yen|\u00a5]]700, which is a high price for a novel written by a newcomer. This worried Narita because it was unlikely anyone would buy the novel. As a result, he and his chief editor decided that the novel would be released in two parts. However, Narita was still anxious about publishing such a long novel.<ref name=\"GrandPunkRailroadLocalAfterword\">{{cite book|last=Narita|first=Ryohgo|others=illus.

As with the first novel, the plot changed because of the characters' \"movements\", most notably Claire Stanfield. Narita noted that all of the Lemure and Russo, with the exception of a character named Neider, were originally planned to die, but Claire's presence in the novel left that concept \"in ruins\". In addition, Chane Laforet, who was not well liked by the author, was also supposed to die, but as time passed, Narita became attached to her and changed her fate.<ref name=\"GrandPunkRailroadExpressAfterword\">{{cite book|last=Narita|first=Ryohgo|others=illus.

Walker states that this is probably the longest casting process [[Funimation]] has held. He comments that because there are a lot of characters and most of them are older men, a character type he does not work with often, choosing voice actors and familiarizing them with their characters was difficult. He asked many directors and actors for recommendations and mainly aimed to cast newcomers, as he felt ''Baccano!'' provided him a chance to discover newer talent. Walker wished to find actors who could provide the dialect and accents of the various time periods and locations, especially when casting for the characters with heavy European accents.<ref name=\"AnimeTodayTylerWalker\">{{cite video |date = December 5, 2008 |title = Anime Today Talks Baccano!

He attempted to take what he could from ''The Untouchables'', especially [[Robert De Niro]]'s portrayal of [[Al Capone]]. Walker watched movies created and set in the 1930s, including but not limited to ''[[The Public Enemy]]'',  ''[[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]]'', ''[[Once Upon a Time in America]]'',  ''[[Miller's Crossing]]'' and various movies starring [[James Cagney]], because he believed they would give him a truer feel on how people of the era sounded and talked. He wanted to capture the lingo and rhythm. Because ''Baccano!'' is a \"stylized gangster flick\" and because of the nature of anime, he made the dialogue  more flowery and lingo-ridden than it would have been in reality.<ref name=\"AnimeTodayTylerWalker\"/>\n\n== Media ==\n\n=== Light novels ===\n{{Main|List of Baccano! light novels}}\nThe ''Baccano!''
