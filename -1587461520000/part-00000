Camels are known to cause serious degradation of local environmental and cultural sites, particularly during dry conditions. An AU$19 million management program was funded in 2009, and, upon completion in 2013, the feral population was estimated to have been reduced to around 300,000.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Misery Coolgardie.jpg|thumb|A prospector riding a camel which held a world record for distance travelled without water (600 miles), 1895]] Camels had been used successfully in desert exploration in other parts of the world. The first suggestion of importing camels into Australia was made in 1822 by Danish-French geographer and journalist [[Conrad Malte-Brun]], whose ''Universal Geography'' contains the following; ;) ;) hellooooo\n\n<blockquote>For such an expedition, men of science and courage ought to be selected. They ought to be provided with all sorts of implements and stores, and with different animals, from the powers and instincts of which they may derive assistance. They should have oxen from Buenos Aires, or from the English settlements, mules from Senegal, and dromedaries from Africa or Arabia. The oxen would traverse the woods and the thickets; the mules would walk securely among rugged rocks and hilly countries; the dromedaries would cross the sandy deserts. Thus the expedition would be prepared for any kind of territory that the interior might present. Dogs also should be taken to raise game, and to discover springs of water; and it has even been proposed to take pigs, for the sake of finding out esculent roots in the soil. When no kangaroos and game are to be found the party would subsist on the flesh of their own flocks. They should be provided with a balloon for spying at a distance any serious obstacle to their progress in particular directions, and for extending the range of observations which the eye would take of such level lands as are too wide to allow any heights beyond them to come within the compass of their view.<ref>Conrad Malte-Brun, ''Universal Geography: Containing the description of India and Oceanica'', Volume III 'containing the description of India and Oceanica', Book LVI 'Oceanica', Part IV 'New Holland and its dependancies', p. 568.

As their knowledge of the Australian outback and economy increased, the cameleers began their own businesses, importing and running [[camel train]]s.

An exchange of skills, knowledge and goods soon developed. Some cameleers assisted Aboriginal people by carrying traditional exchange goods, including red ochre or the narcotic plant [[pituri]], along ancient trade routes such as the [[Birdsville Track]]. The cameleers also brought new commodities such as sugar, tea, tobacco, clothing and metal tools to remote Aboriginal groups. Aboriginal people incorporated camel hair into their traditional string artefacts, and provided information on desert waters and plant resources. Some cameleers employed Aboriginal men and women to assist them on their long desert treks.

The first of Kramer's trips was to the [[Musgrave Ranges]] and [[Mann Ranges]], and was sponsored by the Aborigines Friends Association, which sought a report on Indigenous living conditions. According to Kramer's biography, as the men travelled through the desert and encountered local people, they handed them boiled sweets, tea and sugar and played ''Jesus Loves Me'' on the gramophone. At night, using a \"magic lantern projector\", Kramer showed slides of [[Christmas]] and the life of Christ.

Some traditional food plants harvested by Aboriginal people in these areas are seriously affected by camel-browsing.

Camels are known to cause serious degradation of local environmental and cultural sites, particularly during dry conditions.

The first suggestion of importing camels into Australia was made in 1822 by Danish-French geographer and journalist [[Conrad Malte-Brun]], whose ''Universal Geography'' contains the following;\n\n<blockquote>For such an expedition, men of science and courage ought to be selected. They ought to be provided with all sorts of implements and stores, and with different animals, from the powers and instincts of which they may derive assistance. They should have oxen from Buenos Aires, or from the English settlements, mules from Senegal, and dromedaries from Africa or Arabia. The oxen would traverse the woods and the thickets; the mules would walk securely among rugged rocks and hilly countries; the dromedaries would cross the sandy deserts. Thus the expedition would be prepared for any kind of territory that the interior might present. Dogs also should be taken to raise game, and to discover springs of water; and it has even been proposed to take pigs, for the sake of finding out esculent roots in the soil. When no kangaroos and game are to be found the party would subsist on the flesh of their own flocks. They should be provided with a balloon for spying at a distance any serious obstacle to their progress in particular directions, and for extending the range of observations which the eye would take of such level lands as are too wide to allow any heights beyond them to come within the compass of their view.<ref>Conrad Malte-Brun, ''Universal Geography: Containing the description of India and Oceanica'', Volume III 'containing the description of India and Oceanica', Book LVI 'Oceanica', Part IV 'New Holland and its dependancies', p. 568.

The cameleers also brought new commodities such as sugar, tea, tobacco, clothing and metal tools to remote Aboriginal groups. Aboriginal people incorporated camel hair into their traditional string artefacts, and provided information on desert waters and plant resources.

According to Kramer's biography, as the men travelled through the desert and encountered local people, they handed them boiled sweets, tea and sugar and played ''Jesus Loves Me'' on the gramophone.

Degradation of the environment occurs when densities exceed two animals per square kilometre, which is presently the case throughout much of their range in the [[Northern Territory]] where they are confined to two main regions: the [[Simpson Desert]] and the western desert area of the [[Central Ranges]], [[Great Sandy Desert]] and [[Tanami Desert]]. Some traditional food plants harvested by Aboriginal people in these areas are seriously affected by camel-browsing. While having soft-padded feet makes soil erosion less likely, they do destabilise dune crests, which can contribute to erosion. Feral camels do have a noticeable impact on salt lake ecosystems, and have been found to foul waterholes.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Brain|first1=Caddie|title=Waterholes fall foul to feral camels in dry spell|url=http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2012/s3589978.htm|accessdate=6 March 2016|agency=AM|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=14 September 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe National Feral Camel Action Plan (see below) cited the following environmental impacts: \"broad landscape damage including damage to vegetation through foraging behaviour and trampling, suppression of recruitment of some plant species, selective browsing on rare and threatened flora, damage to wetlands through fouling, trampling and sedimentation, competition with native animals for food and shelter and loss of sequestered carbon in vegetation\".<ref name=camelplan>{{cite web|url=https://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/2060c7a8-088f-415d-94c8-5d0d657614e8/files/feral-camel-action-plan.pdf|title=National Feral Camel Action Plan: A national strategy for the management of feral camels in Australia|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|date=2010|author= Australian Government.

Nadar photographed a wide range of personalities: politicians (Guizot, Proudhon), stage actors ([[Sarah Bernhardt]]), writers (Hugo, Baudelaire, Sand, Nerval, Gautier, Dumas), painters (Corot, Delacroix, Millet), and musicians (Liszt, Rossini, Offenbach, Verdi, Berlioz).<ref name=\"archivesdefrance\"/> Portrait photography was going through a period of native industrialization and Nadar refused to use the traditional sumptuous decors; he preferred natural daylight and despised useless accessories.

This was done using the [[Collodion process|wet plate collodion process]], and since the plates had to be prepared and developed (a process that required a chemically neutral setting) while the basket was aloft, Nadar experienced imaging problems as gas escaped from his balloons.

The village has a population of 10,133 (2011) and is served by six churches, four [[pubs]], five schools, a library, various [[Retailing#Shops and stores|shops]] and local businesses, a [[village hall]], and many community and sports organisations.

It lies within the [[Dorset Heaths]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Early nomadic tribes and settlers ===\nThe first evidence of people living in the area consists mainly of a number of [[flint]] axeheads that have been found within the village and which date from the [[Palaeolithic]] and [[Mesolithic]], or the \"Old and Middle [[Stone Age]]s\". Around 3000 BC, the first real settlers came, cleared the forests and began to farm, although even they were largely nomadic. Later settlers, during the [[Bronze Age]], built burial mounds or [[Tumulus|barrows]], examples of which may be found to the east of the village at Barrow Hill and at Naked Cross at the southern end of the village.  These forms of occupation continued into the [[Iron Age]]; evidence of pottery manufactured around the 1st century BC may be found at East End. Just prior to the coming of the Romans, in around 50 BC, the area was inhabited by the [[Belgae]].\n\n=== Romans ===\nThe [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Legio II Augusta|Second Legion]] under [[Vespasian]] arrived in the Corfe Mullen area during the fifth decade of the 1st century AD and built a {{convert|40|acre|ha|adj=on}} fortress just to the north of the village at Lake Farm.  The location of this fortress was important; the [[River Stour, Dorset|River Stour]] provided a defensive barrier to the north and the site is only {{convert|3|mi|km}} from the Iron Age Hill Fort at [[Badbury Rings]]. Lake cut this important tribal centre off from the settlements at Dudsbury and [[Hengistbury|Hengistbury Head]].\n[[Image:Corfe Mullen Roman Road.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Roman road east of the village (the road is the overgrown bank on the left)]]\nTo subjugate the local tribes and keep themselves supplied and in communication with other Roman centres, the Legion built several [[roads]] that run through or close to the area.  Probably the most important of these, and the only one visible today, is the road that connected the deep water anchorage at Morionio (now [[Hamworthy]]) and Lake, and continues northwards to Badbury and [[Hod Hill]].  This road forms the eastern boundary of the village. Traces of two other roads have also been found, both of which are underneath or follow the course of modern roads; one of these linked Lake with [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]], and is roughly aligned with the present A31, the other ran through the spine of the village and followed the present road to [[Wareham, Dorset|Wareham]].\n\nAlthough the Roman occupation of Britain lasted nearly 400 years, the military presence at Corfe Mullen was very short lived, lasting only until the 1st century's seventh decade. However the Roman influence continued in agriculture and industry even after they had left and the [[Celt]]ic-speaking people that descended from the original tribes took over the area again.\n\n=== Saxons ===\nThe [[Saxons]] probably settled in the area around the 7th century. Christianity arrived before 700 AD and open-air services are believed to have been held on the same site as the present-day old village church.  During the centuries leading up to the millennium, division of land into [[Hundred (county subdivision)|Hundreds]] and [[tithe]] took place and [[Manorial]] courts dealt with disputes.  The name of Corf came into usage during this period and was located in the hundred of Cogdean, with the court being held at Cogdean Elms in the north of the present village.\n\nA number of other land holdings dating from this period have been found around the village, the most notable being at Mountain Clump and the Knoll, where the remains of cottages may be seen.\n\n=== Norman period and Middle Ages ===\nAfter the [[Norman Conquest of England|Norman Conquest]], Corf's entry in the [[Domesday Book]] shows that it appears to have been a single manor under 'Robert, son of Gerold', but was previously held by two Saxon lords; Waga and Egelric.  At some time during the next two or three centuries, the village reverted to two manors; probably Corf Molin and Corf Hubert. The latter manor was almost certainly named after a former lord, Hubert de la Vielle. By 1469 the two manors were combined into one again, although the two names were still preserved at that time.  It was probably another century before the present day name came about; this merger was probably driven by the general depopulation of the country that occurred in the [[Middle Ages]] due to migration to the towns and the [[Black Death]].\n\nA third part of the village came to be known as Corfe Mullen St Nicholas and the origin of this appears to date back to a land acquisition by St Nicholas Hospital (a [[Salisbury]] charity) in 1279. The present day areas of Lambs Green, East End and Brog Street were still called this until the early part of the 20th century.\n\nConstruction of the original parish church, then called St Nicholas but now St Hubert's, was commenced during the 13th century, with the tower being added a little later.\n\n=== Elizabethan to Georgian period ===\n[[Image:Corfe Mullen Lockyers School.jpg|thumb|left|Part of Lockyer's Middle School in 2006]]\nAfter the major changes seen after the Normans, a period of stability came to the village for about 300 years. From [[Elizabethan]] to [[Georgian period in British history|Georgian]] times prosperity increased, with a number of wealthy families being the major landowners. None of these families built their homes within the parish boundaries, although the Phelipps family took over an Elizabethan Manor House (the Court House) near the church and lived there for many years. Other architectural legacies of this period are some notable farm houses, a few cottages and the original building that housed Lockyer's Charity School, formed in 1706 by Richard Lockyer. This building is still used by the present day Lockyer's Middle School.\n\nDuring the latter half of the 18th century a [[toll road]] was constructed by private enterprise; Higher Blandford Road and Mill Street were part of a new route between [[Poole]] and [[Blandford]] which resulted in the people of Corfe Mullen having access to the major markets of these two towns.\n\n=== Victorian era ===\nDuring the reign of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] more toll roads were constructed, including an extension to Mill Street which provided a new route from [[Bere Regis]] to [[Wimborne]]. The railways arrived by the late 19th century, with tracks first appearing within walking distance of the village at [[Wimborne]] and later with a route that went through the village, though it was well into the 20th century before a [[Corfe Mullen Halt|halt]] was provided.\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn the 20th century development accelerated. Development between the wars occurred along Higher Blandford Road and Wareham Road, with the populated area gradually extending up the hill, away from the original riverside centre at Mill Street and the older cottages at Brog Street, Lambs Green and East End. In the 1950s and 1960s major new housing estates were built around Phelipps Road and Hilltop Road, and in the last forty years of the century, new housing was built on most of the area between [[Broadstone, Dorset|Broadstone]] and the eastern boundary of the village.\n\nDuring the early part of the century, the village became known for its [[Violet (plant)|violet]] and [[lavender]] cultivation, which was centred around Violet Farm. The trade diminished however and the farm was demolished in the 1960s, along with a 300-year-old [[tithe barn]], to make way for new bungalows.\n\n=== 21st century ===\nDuring the first decade of the 21st century, proposals were made by the [[Regional Assemblies in England|South West Regional Assembly]] to build 800 new homes on [[green belt]] land on the edge of the village. These plans were opposed by a majority of villagers. The developments were shelved and East Dorset District Council later published more modest plans to build on the sites of the Middle School or recreation ground. The adoption of any of these sites would require relocation of the school or recreational facilities. A public consultation period ended in January 2011 and the results are awaited.\n\n== Facilities ==\nCorfe Mullen is a dormitory settlement for people working in the nearby towns and cities of [[Wimborne]], [[Poole]], [[Bournemouth]], [[Ferndown]], [[Verwood]] and [[Southampton]]. It is one of the biggest villages in England. The countryside around the village is split between agriculture and heathland, with woodland to be found fringing most areas, the largest of which is [[Stoney Down Plantation]] to the west. The existence of many [[Rights of way in England and Wales|bridleway]]s criss-crossing the area around the village encourages horse riding and there are a number of stables nearby.  The village also has a large recreation ground with facilities for outdoor sports including football, cricket and tennis. This is run by the Corfe Mullen Sports Association, which is made up of volunteers from various sports clubs around Corfe Mullen. There are new allotments on Broadmoor Road that have been in use since 1 November 2019, replacing the old allotments near Lockyer's School which are being built on.\n\n=== Churches ===\n* St Hubert's, the original parish church.\n* St Nicholas, the new Anglican church.\n* Corfe Mullen Baptist Church\n* Sunnyhill Church Corfe Mullen\n* Knoll Farm Christian Fellowship\n\n=== Pubs ===\n* The Coventry Arms\n* The Dorset Soldier\n* The Holme Bush\n* The Lambs Green Inn\n* Royal British Legion\n\n=== Caf\u00e9s and restaurants ===\n* Taj (Indian & Bengali Cuisine)\n* Chinese Whispers\n\n=== Schools ===\n* Henbury View First School\n* Lockyer's Middle School\n* Rushcombe First School\n* [[Corfe Hills School]] (actually just outside the village in Broadstone, but serves older village children)\n* [[Castle Court School]] (A private school for 3 to 13-year olds)\n* Chapel in the Valley Pre-School (At the rear of the Baptist Church, for 2 to 5-year olds)\n* Jack and Jill Day Nursery\n* Tops Day Nursery\n\n=== Library ===\n* Corfe Mullen Library, 54 Wareham Road (By the Co-op Supermarket)\n\n=== Children's Centre ===\n* Corfe Mullen's Sure Start Children's Centre, 54 Wareham Road (The Children's Centre and Library share the same building)\n\n=== Sport===\nCorfe Mullen Cricket Club runs a number of senior and junior sides catering for all abilities and is based at Corfe Mullen Recreation Ground under the auspices of the Corfe Mullen Sports Association. Other members of the association include tennis and football clubs, and most recently even a baseball team.\n\n=== Other places of entertainment ===\nApart from the local pubs, a weekly [[youth club]] is held near to Lockyer's School and various activities are available in the Village Hall.  For those who require entertainment of a more commercial nature, [[Wimborne]], [[Poole]] and [[Bournemouth]] provide a good choice with cinemas, theatres, and night clubs.  The nearest beach, at [[Sandbanks]], is less than {{convert|10|mi|km}} away.\n\n=== Nature park ===\nIn 2016, [[Corfe Barrows Nature Park]] was opened. The [[nature park]] comprises eight natural areas, two of which lie wholly or partially within Corfe Mullen: the Happy Bottom Nature Reserve and Cogdean Elms. The remaining areas lie just over the municipal boundary within the [[Borough of Poole]], but are easily accessible from the village.<ref name=DWT>[http://www.dorsetwildlifetrust.org.uk/Corfe_Barrows_NaturePark.html ''Corfe Barrows Nature Park''] at www.dorsetwildlifetrust.org.uk.

The name of Corf came into usage during this period and was located in the hundred of Cogdean, with the court being held at Cogdean Elms in the north of the present village.\n\nA number of other land holdings dating from this period have been found around the village, the most notable being at Mountain Clump and the Knoll, where the remains of cottages may be seen.\n\n=== Norman period and Middle Ages ===\nAfter the [[Norman Conquest of England|Norman Conquest]], Corf's entry in the [[Domesday Book]] shows that it appears to have been a single manor under 'Robert, son of Gerold', but was previously held by two Saxon lords; Waga and Egelric.  At some time during the next two or three centuries, the village reverted to two manors; probably Corf Molin and Corf Hubert. The latter manor was almost certainly named after a former lord, Hubert de la Vielle. By 1469 the two manors were combined into one again, although the two names were still preserved at that time.  It was probably another century before the present day name came about; this merger was probably driven by the general depopulation of the country that occurred in the [[Middle Ages]] due to migration to the towns and the [[Black Death]].\n\nA third part of the village came to be known as Corfe Mullen St Nicholas and the origin of this appears to date back to a land acquisition by St Nicholas Hospital (a [[Salisbury]] charity) in 1279. The present day areas of Lambs Green, East End and Brog Street were still called this until the early part of the 20th century.\n\nConstruction of the original parish church, then called St Nicholas but now St Hubert's, was commenced during the 13th century, with the tower being added a little later.\n\n=== Elizabethan to Georgian period ===\n[[Image:Corfe Mullen Lockyers School.jpg|thumb|left|Part of Lockyer's Middle School in 2006]]\nAfter the major changes seen after the Normans, a period of stability came to the village for about 300 years. From [[Elizabethan]] to [[Georgian period in British history|Georgian]] times prosperity increased, with a number of wealthy families being the major landowners. None of these families built their homes within the parish boundaries, although the Phelipps family took over an Elizabethan Manor House (the Court House) near the church and lived there for many years. Other architectural legacies of this period are some notable farm houses, a few cottages and the original building that housed Lockyer's Charity School, formed in 1706 by Richard Lockyer. This building is still used by the present day Lockyer's Middle School.\n\nDuring the latter half of the 18th century a [[toll road]] was constructed by private enterprise; Higher Blandford Road and Mill Street were part of a new route between [[Poole]] and [[Blandford]] which resulted in the people of Corfe Mullen having access to the major markets of these two towns.\n\n=== Victorian era ===\nDuring the reign of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] more toll roads were constructed, including an extension to Mill Street which provided a new route from [[Bere Regis]] to [[Wimborne]]. The railways arrived by the late 19th century, with tracks first appearing within walking distance of the village at [[Wimborne]] and later with a route that went through the village, though it was well into the 20th century before a [[Corfe Mullen Halt|halt]] was provided.\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn the 20th century development accelerated. Development between the wars occurred along Higher Blandford Road and Wareham Road, with the populated area gradually extending up the hill, away from the original riverside centre at Mill Street and the older cottages at Brog Street, Lambs Green and East End. In the 1950s and 1960s major new housing estates were built around Phelipps Road and Hilltop Road, and in the last forty years of the century, new housing was built on most of the area between [[Broadstone, Dorset|Broadstone]] and the eastern boundary of the village.\n\nDuring the early part of the century, the village became known for its [[Violet (plant)|violet]] and [[lavender]] cultivation, which was centred around Violet Farm. The trade diminished however and the farm was demolished in the 1960s, along with a 300-year-old [[tithe barn]], to make way for new bungalows.\n\n=== 21st century ===\nDuring the first decade of the 21st century, proposals were made by the [[Regional Assemblies in England|South West Regional Assembly]] to build 800 new homes on [[green belt]] land on the edge of the village. These plans were opposed by a majority of villagers. The developments were shelved and East Dorset District Council later published more modest plans to build on the sites of the Middle School or recreation ground. The adoption of any of these sites would require relocation of the school or recreational facilities. A public consultation period ended in January 2011 and the results are awaited.\n\n== Facilities ==\nCorfe Mullen is a dormitory settlement for people working in the nearby towns and cities of [[Wimborne]], [[Poole]], [[Bournemouth]], [[Ferndown]], [[Verwood]] and [[Southampton]]. It is one of the biggest villages in England. The countryside around the village is split between agriculture and heathland, with woodland to be found fringing most areas, the largest of which is [[Stoney Down Plantation]] to the west. The existence of many [[Rights of way in England and Wales|bridleway]]s criss-crossing the area around the village encourages horse riding and there are a number of stables nearby.  The village also has a large recreation ground with facilities for outdoor sports including football, cricket and tennis. This is run by the Corfe Mullen Sports Association, which is made up of volunteers from various sports clubs around Corfe Mullen. There are new allotments on Broadmoor Road that have been in use since 1 November 2019, replacing the old allotments near Lockyer's School which are being built on.\n\n=== Churches ===\n* St Hubert's, the original parish church.\n* St Nicholas, the new Anglican church.\n* Corfe Mullen Baptist Church\n* Sunnyhill Church Corfe Mullen\n* Knoll Farm Christian Fellowship\n\n=== Pubs ===\n* The Coventry Arms\n* The Dorset Soldier\n* The Holme Bush\n* The Lambs Green Inn\n* Royal British Legion\n\n=== Caf\u00e9s and restaurants ===\n* Taj (Indian & Bengali Cuisine)\n* Chinese Whispers\n\n=== Schools ===\n* Henbury View First School\n* Lockyer's Middle School\n* Rushcombe First School\n* [[Corfe Hills School]] (actually just outside the village in Broadstone, but serves older village children)\n* [[Castle Court School]] (A private school for 3 to 13-year olds)\n* Chapel in the Valley Pre-School (At the rear of the Baptist Church, for 2 to 5-year olds)\n* Jack and Jill Day Nursery\n* Tops Day Nursery\n\n=== Library ===\n* Corfe Mullen Library, 54 Wareham Road (By the Co-op Supermarket)\n\n=== Children's Centre ===\n* Corfe Mullen's Sure Start Children's Centre, 54 Wareham Road (The Children's Centre and Library share the same building)\n\n=== Sport===\nCorfe Mullen Cricket Club runs a number of senior and junior sides catering for all abilities and is based at Corfe Mullen Recreation Ground under the auspices of the Corfe Mullen Sports Association. Other members of the association include tennis and football clubs, and most recently even a baseball team.\n\n=== Other places of entertainment ===\nApart from the local pubs, a weekly [[youth club]] is held near to Lockyer's School and various activities are available in the Village Hall.  For those who require entertainment of a more commercial nature, [[Wimborne]], [[Poole]] and [[Bournemouth]] provide a good choice with cinemas, theatres, and night clubs.  The nearest beach, at [[Sandbanks]], is less than {{convert|10|mi|km}} away.\n\n=== Nature park ===\nIn 2016, [[Corfe Barrows Nature Park]] was opened. The [[nature park]] comprises eight natural areas, two of which lie wholly or partially within Corfe Mullen: the Happy Bottom Nature Reserve and Cogdean Elms. The remaining areas lie just over the municipal boundary within the [[Borough of Poole]], but are easily accessible from the village.<ref name=DWT>[http://www.dorsetwildlifetrust.org.uk/Corfe_Barrows_NaturePark.html ''Corfe Barrows Nature Park''] at www.dorsetwildlifetrust.org.uk.

It is spread over approximately 30 square kilometers. Due to its position between two rivers, the [[Sava]] and [[Una (Sava)|Una]], the village takes a horseshoe shape.\n\nThe village has dense housing, as well as typical suburban housing on either side of the main road. The railroad extends parallel to said road in the direction south-east to the north-west (direction Hr.Dubica-Sisak) on the right side. This part of the village is nearly flat and an ideal lowland portion. The right of the village is in the same flat area, and the lowland continues for around 1.5-2&nbsp; km. This area extends to the great forests that extend back in the same valley to the Sava River. The left part of the road about 50 to 100 meters-is also the same plane on which supplements a gentle hills difference in altitude is not greater than 10-20 km compared to his village and this flat, and not too steep. Upon leaving the hilltops and again extends a plain, plateau, which extends about 4-5km and descends in Pounje (river valley Una).\n\nI am pup\n\n==Population==\nAccording to data gathered in 2001, the village has 484 inhabitants and approximately 290 houses. \n\nIn 1991, \u017divaja had 726 residents, and in 1969 there were 800. According to the 1991 census,<ref>Izdanje Dr\u017eavnog zavoda za statistiku RH: Narodnosni sastav stanovni\u0161tva RH od 1880-1991. godine.</ref> 90.91% of the village population were ethnic [[Serbs of Croatia|Serbs]] (660/726), 1.93% were ethnic [[Croats]] (14/726), 8.03% were [[Yugoslavs]] (9/726), and 5.92% and were of other ethnic origins (43/726).\n\nIn the 2011 population census, ethnic [[Croats]] made up 65.70% (203/309) of the village population while ethnic [[Serbs of Croatia|Serbs]] made up only  31.39% (97/309).\n\n{{Croatian population data graph\n |naslov = '''Population growth 1857\u20132011'''<ref>[http://www.dzs.hr/Hrv/pxweb2003/database/Naselja%20i%20stanovnistvo%20Republike%20Hrvatske/Naselja%20i%20stanovnistvo%20Republike%20Hrvatske.asp Naselja i stanovni\u0161tvo Republike Hrvatske 1857.-2001., www.dzs.hr]</ref>\n |dimx    = 550\n |dimy    = \n |stanmax = 1450\n |crta1   = 100\n |crta2   = 50\n |a1      = 1857\n |a2      = 1869\n |a3      = 1880\n |a4      = 1890\n |a5      = 1900\n |a6      = 1910\n |a7      = 1921\n |a8      = 1931\n |a9      = 1948\n |a10     = 1953\n |a11     = 1961\n |a12     = 1971\n |a13     = 1981\n |a14     = 1991\n |a15     = 2001\n |a16     = 2011\n |p1      = 792\n |p2      = 982\n |p3      = 1048\n |p4      = 1187\n |p5      = 1178\n |p6      = 1357\n |p7      = 1317\n |p8      = 1444\n |p9      = 1062\n |p10     = 1057\n |p11     = 1055\n |p12     = 943\n |p13     = 800\n |p14     = 726\n |p15     = 484\n |p16     = 309 \n |izvor = Croatian Bureau of Statistics\n }}\n\n== History ==\nOf individual documents on population in this area, the [[Banovina (region)|Banovina]], there is one from the year 1687. The document Croatian ban Nikola Erd\u00f6dy call Zagreb Bishop Martin Borkovi\u0107a [[Zagreb Bishop Martin Borkovi\u0107a]] to allow colonization by Serbs Bovi\u0107 and Kirin, which were in possession bishops. Sometime later Petrinjska counts Erd\u00f6dy Francis, the year 1693. sets Prince Peter Draskovic for chief Serbs in Slabinji and other surrounding areas. Lower Banovina had their possessions the family of Croatian nobles [[House of Keglevi\u0107|Keglevi\u0107]]. Because of their possessions around Blinje, they were with the sukobljavali constantly Turks. For this reason, Croatian aristocrat Peter Keglevi\u0107 inhabits Wallachian families around Petrinja. The year 1697. leads Vlahe wrong. That same year, Serbs are settled in and around Sunja. Two years later, in 1699 was inhabited by \u017divaja.\n\nAfter World War II population in the village focused mainly on agricultural production and livestock breeding as the primary branches. The country's economy is run in a very primitive way, using animals to assist in a lot of human work. Were to chipped households, with a small number of livestock and small land parcel. Owing to its very difficult work, people were able to vegetate and recover from the terrors of war (1945 whole village was in ash). Productivity was very weak, and the daily work was hard and tiring. Because of proximity to city centers (Petrinja, Sisak, Zagreb) and the existence of traffic connections with those cities, industrialization development, the late fifties and early sixties of the last century, people are increasingly going to work in factories. A large part of the male population was employed in the cities. Thanks to daily migrations of people are, in addition to working in factories, managed to sustain agricultural production and even the more they build on a higher level. As time went by all over the went young people in the cities of the training.{{clarification needed|date=May 2016}} Given the popularity of the then no life at the village and on agriculture, after schooling the young are mainly employed and remained in the cities.\n\nBetween 1969 and 1991, the average age of the population in the village increased, which points to the possibility that the working-age population largely fled the village.

It is spread over approximately 30 square kilometers. Due to its position between two rivers, the [[Sava]] and [[Una (Sava)|Una]], the village takes a horseshoe shape.\n\nThe village features dense housing, as well as typical suburban housing on either side of the main road. The railroad extends parallel to said road in the direction south-east to the north-west (direction Hr.Dubica-Sisak) on the right side. This part of the village is nearly flat and an ideal lowland portion. The right of the village is in the same flat area, and the lowland continues for around 1.5-2&nbsp; km. This area extends to the great forest farms that extend back in the same valley to the Sava River. The left part of the road about 50 to 100 meters-is also the same plane on which supplements a gentle hills difference in altitude is not greater than 10-20 km compared to his village and this flat, and not too steep. Upon leaving the hilltops and again extends a plain, plateau, which extends about 4-5km and descends in Pounje (river valley Una).\n\n==Population==\nAccording to data gathered in 2001, the village has 484 inhabitants and approximately 290 houses. \n\nIn 1991, \u017divaja had 726 residents, and in 1969 there were 800. According to the 1991 census,<ref>Izdanje Dr\u017eavnog zavoda za statistiku RH: Narodnosni sastav stanovni\u0161tva RH od 1880-1991. godine.</ref> 90.91% of the village population were ethnic [[Serbs of Croatia|Serbs]] (660/726), 1.93% were ethnic [[Croats]] (14/726), 8.03% were [[Yugoslavs]] (9/726), and 5.92% and were of other ethnic origins (43/726).\n\nIn the 2011 population census, ethnic [[Croats]] made up 65.70% (203/309) of the village population while ethnic [[Serbs of Croatia|Serbs]] made up only  31.39% (97/309).\n\n{{Croatian population data graph\n |naslov = '''Population growth 1857\u20132011'''<ref>[http://www.dzs.hr/Hrv/pxweb2003/database/Naselja%20i%20stanovnistvo%20Republike%20Hrvatske/Naselja%20i%20stanovnistvo%20Republike%20Hrvatske.asp Naselja i stanovni\u0161tvo Republike Hrvatske 1857.-2001., www.dzs.hr]</ref>\n |dimx    = 550\n |dimy    = \n |stanmax = 1450\n |crta1   = 100\n |crta2   = 50\n |a1      = 1857\n |a2      = 1869\n |a3      = 1880\n |a4      = 1890\n |a5      = 1900\n |a6      = 1910\n |a7      = 1921\n |a8      = 1931\n |a9      = 1948\n |a10     = 1953\n |a11     = 1961\n |a12     = 1971\n |a13     = 1981\n |a14     = 1991\n |a15     = 2001\n |a16     = 2011\n |p1      = 792\n |p2      = 982\n |p3      = 1048\n |p4      = 1187\n |p5      = 1178\n |p6      = 1357\n |p7      = 1317\n |p8      = 1444\n |p9      = 1062\n |p10     = 1057\n |p11     = 1055\n |p12     = 943\n |p13     = 800\n |p14     = 726\n |p15     = 484\n |p16     = 309 \n |izvor = Croatian Bureau of Statistics\n }}\n\n== History ==\nOf individual documents on population in this area, the [[Banovina (region)|Banovina]], there is one from the year 1687. The document Croatian ban Nikola Erd\u00f6dy call Zagreb Bishop Martin Borkovi\u0107a [[Zagreb Bishop Martin Borkovi\u0107a]] to allow colonization by Serbs Bovi\u0107 and Kirin, which were in possession bishops. Sometime later Petrinjska counts Erd\u00f6dy Francis, the year 1693. sets Prince Peter Draskovic for chief Serbs in Slabinji and other surrounding areas. Lower Banovina had their possessions the family of Croatian nobles [[House of Keglevi\u0107|Keglevi\u0107]]. Because of their possessions around Blinje, they were with the sukobljavali constantly Turks. For this reason, Croatian aristocrat Peter Keglevi\u0107 inhabits Wallachian families around Petrinja. The year 1697. leads Vlahe wrong. That same year, Serbs are settled in and around Sunja. Two years later, in 1699 was inhabited by \u017divaja.\n\nAfter World War II population in the village focused mainly on agricultural production and livestock breeding as the primary branches. The country's economy is run in a very primitive way, using animals to assist in a lot of human work. Were to chipped households, with a small number of livestock and small land parcel. Owing to its very difficult work, people were able to vegetate and recover from the terrors of war (1945 whole village was in ash). Productivity was very weak, and the daily work was hard and tiring. Because of proximity to city centers (Petrinja, Sisak, Zagreb) and the existence of traffic connections with those cities, industrialization development, the late fifties and early sixties of the last century, people are increasingly going to work in factories. A large part of the male population was employed in the cities. Thanks to daily migrations of people are, in addition to working in factories, managed to sustain agricultural production and even the more they build on a higher level. As time went by all over the went young people in the cities of the training.{{clarification needed|date=May 2016}} Given the popularity of the then no life at the village and on agriculture, after schooling the young are mainly employed and remained in the cities.\n\nBetween 1969 and 1991, the average age of the population in the village increased, which points to the possibility that the working-age population largely fled the village. From the list of 1981.g. with 800 inhabitants, there was a drop to 726 on the list 1991.g.\n\n==Traffic connections==\nThrough the village [[\u017divaja]] passing road traffic categorized as the state of roads and carrying the label D224.\n\nThe railroad that passes parallel to the village, the distance of about 300 meters from the construction zone [[villages]], classified in the category of tracks from the importance of international trade.
