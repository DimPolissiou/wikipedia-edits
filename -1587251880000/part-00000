Van Basten famously dropped regulars like [[Clarence Seedorf]], [[Patrick Kluivert]], [[Edgar Davids]] and [[Roy Makaay]] and benched [[Mark van Bommel]], because he believed that they were either past their prime or constantly underachieving. There were also calls for Van Basten to call up Dennis Bergkamp, who had retired from the national team six years earlier, for a final \"hurrah,\" as he was retiring that season. Van Basten then revealed to the media that he never intended to do so, despite Bergkamp's own willingness.\n\nFor probably the first time in decades, none of the \"Big Three\" Clubs (Ajax, [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] and [[Feyenoord]]) provided the backbone for the national team. Instead, newcomer [[AZ Alkmaar|AZ]] led the way with players such as [[Denny Landzaat]], [[Barry Opdam]], [[Barry van Galen]], [[Ron Vlaar]], [[Jan Kromkamp]] and [[Joris Mathijsen]]. AZ, at the time a local small football club for Dutch standards, proved to be successful in the Dutch league and in the UEFA Cup. Other unheralded choices were [[Khalid Boulahrouz]], [[Hedwiges Maduro]], [[Ryan Babel]] and [[Romeo Castelen]]. Van Basten had also wanted to include [[Ivory Coast|Ivorian]] forward [[Salomon Kalou]], but was thwarted when Kalou was denied Dutch citizenship by the immigration authorities headed by Dutch Minister of Integration [[Rita Verdonk]]. Kalou eventually accepted a call-up to play for [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]].\n\nUnder his guidance, the team were unbeaten in their World Cup qualification group and made it through the group stages at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]], but were eliminated in a [[Battle of Nuremberg (2006 FIFA World Cup)|frenzied 1\u20130 loss]] to [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in the Round of 16.

However, in the second half of the season, striker [[Klaas-Jan Huntelaar]] left for [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], and Van Basten started switching around his lineups. When Ajax lost 11 points in four matches, the [[List of Dutch football champions|Eredivisie title]] was out of sight. However, Ajax still had the chance to finish in second place, which would have ensured a place in the third qualifying round of the Champions League. Two important losses against PSV (6\u20132) and Sparta Rotterdam (4\u20130), however, ensured that Van Basten's Ajax could only finish third in the league. Van Basten decided to resign as Ajax manager at the end of the [[2008\u201309 Eredivisie|2008\u201309]] season. Van Basten subsequently became a pundit for [[Sport1 (Netherlands)|Sport1]], but was still planning to return as a manager.

Van Basten famously dropped regulars like [[Clarence Seedorf]], [[Patrick Kluivert]], [[Edgar Davids]] and [[Roy Makaay]] and benched [[Mark van Bommel]], because he believed that they were either past their prime or constantly underachieving. There were also calls for Van Basten to call up Dennis Bergkamp, who had retired from the national team six years earlier, for a final \"hurrah,\" as he was retiring that season. Van Basten then revealed to the media that he never intended to do so, despite Bergkamp's own willingness.\n\nFor probably the first time in decades, none of the \"Big Three\" Clubs (Ajax, [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] and [[Feyenoord]]) provided the backbone for the national team. Instead, newcomer [[AZ Alkmaar|AZ]] led the way with players such as [[Denny Landzaat]], [[Barry Opdam]], [[Barry van Galen]], [[Ron Vlaar]], [[Jan Kromkamp]] and [[Joris Mathijsen]]. AZ, at the time a local small football club for Dutch standards, proved to be successful in the Dutch league and in the UEFA Cup. Other unheralded choices were [[Khalid Boulahrouz]], [[Hedwiges Maduro]], [[Ryan Babel]] and [[Romeo Castelen]]. Van Basten had also wanted to include [[Ivory Coast|Ivorian]] forward [[Salomon Kalou]], but was thwarted when Kalou was denied Dutch citizenship by the immigration authorities headed by Dutch Minister of Integration [[Rita Verdonk]].

However, in the second half of the season, striker [[Klaas-Jan Huntelaar]] left for [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], and Van Basten started switching around his lineups. When Ajax lost 11 points in four matches, the [[List of Dutch football champions|Eredivisie title]] was out of sight. However, Ajax still had the chance to finish in second place, which would have ensured a place in the third qualifying round of the Champions League. Two important losses against PSV (6\u20132) and Sparta Rotterdam (4\u20130), however, ensured that Van Basten's Ajax could only finish third in the league. Van Basten decided to resign as Ajax manager at the end of the [[2008\u201309 Eredivisie|2008\u201309]] season.

There are extensions and properties to help display the correct control types.\n\n=== Threading ===\nOne capability that a host can provide to a plugin is a \"worker thread\". In programming terms, this means that the plugin can offload some work to be done in another thread that the host provides. This is generally useful because a plugin is usually run in the real-time audio thread of an application, and hence cannot do any non-real-time safe operations (disk-accesses, system calls, etc.). To make it easy for the plugin to achieve its goals (e.g.: load a file from disk), the host can provide a worker thread. The host provides the LV2_Extension for the worker thread<ref>http://lv2plug.in/ns/ext/worker/</ref> and the plugin is then able to use it.\n\n== Development ==\nThere are tools and frameworks available to assist with in creating LV2 plugins. These include [[DISTRHO Plugin Framework|DPF]] (DISTRHO Plugin Framework), two forks of [[JUCE]], [[FAUST (programming language)|Faust]], Dplug, iPlug 2 (alpha), and Cabbage (alpha). There is also the ability to load [[Pure Data]] patches as well as [[Just-in-time compilation|JIT]]-run Faust, Rust or C code in certain LV2 plugins.

Its [[executive producer]]s were [[Steven Spielberg]], [[Walter Parkes]], [[Laurie MacDonald]] and [[Gerald R. Molen]]. The film stars [[Helen Hunt]], [[Bill Paxton]], [[Jami Gertz]] and [[Cary Elwes]], and depicts a group of [[Storm chasing|storm chasers]] researching [[Tornado|tornadoes]] during a [[Tornado outbreak|severe outbreak]] in Oklahoma. \n\n''Twister'' grossed $494.5 million worldwide, and became the [[1996 in film#Highest-grossing films|second-highest-grossing film of 1996]]; an estimated 54.7 million tickets were sold in the US.<ref name=\"BoxOfficeMojo\" /> The film was met with a mixed critical reception, receiving criticism for its screenplay and praise for its visual effects and sound design. The film received [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound]], but lost both to ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]'' and ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]'' respectively.\n\n==Plot==\nIn June 1969 [[Oklahoma]], young Jo Thornton and her family are awakened by an approaching [[Fujita scale|F5 tornado]]. The family seeks refuge in their storm cellar, but the tornado rips the cellar door off and pulls Jo's father to his death while Jo and her mother look on. The next morning, they awake to find their farmhouse destroyed. \n\nIn the present day, 27 years after the death of Jo's father, the [[National Severe Storms Laboratory]] predicts a record outbreak of tornadoes in Oklahoma over a 24-hour period. Now an adult, Jo, a [[meteorology|meteorologist]] and [[storm chasing|storm chaser]], is reunited with her estranged husband, Bill Harding, a former weather researcher and fellow storm chaser, who has since moved on to become a popular television weather reporter. He has a brand new [[Dodge Ram]] pickup truck and is planning to marry reproductive therapist Melissa Reeves. However, his plans are delayed until Jo signs her long overdue divorce papers. Arriving to Jo's camp in order to get her to complete the forms, he finds that she and her team have built four tornado research devices called DOROTHY based on Bill's groundbreaking design. Each unit contains hundreds of sensors that, if picked up by a tornado, will provide data that could lead to revolutionary breakthroughs in meteorological research. Before Jo can finish the paperwork, her team rushes to intercept a nearby forming [[Fujita scale|F1 tornado]], forcing Bill and Melissa to chase after her. Bill encounters Dr. Jonas Miller, a corporate-funded meteorologist and long-time rival storm chaser, and learns that he has created a device called DOT-3, a blatant copy of DOROTHY. Bill vows to help Jo deploy DOROTHY before Jonas can deploy DOT-3 and claim credit for the idea.\n\nIn an attempt to deploy DOROTHY and get back to his regular life, Bill maneuvers Jo's [[Jeep Gladiator]] off-road into a muddy ditch towards the rapidly growing tornado. They collide with a small wooden bridge and find themselves trapped in the direct path of the oncoming tornado. As they take cover, Jo's truck and DOROTHY I are both picked up and destroyed by the tornado.\n\nA second tornado is spotted in another part of Oklahoma, and they continue on in Bill's Dodge with Melissa, who has no choice but to tag along in the backseat. Jonas and his team are also moving to intercept the storm cell, which has at this point grown into an [[Fujita scale|F2 tornado]]. However, Bill's intuition that the tornado will shift towards another direction sends them off seemingly in the wrong direction. He is quickly vindicated, which sends Jonas into a fit of rage. The team is then led off-road, eventually hanging back as the storm cell worsens, while Bill, Jo, and Melissa have a dangerous encounter with twin [[waterspout]] tornadoes on a enclosed road and they're spun round, which leaves Melissa shaken. The rest of the team, however, is ecstatic about the encounter and convince Jo to let them go visit Jo's Aunt Meg in the nearby town of [[Wakita, Oklahoma|Wakita]] for food and rest.Jo takes a shower.\n\nThe team arrives in Wakita, where Aunt Meg prepares a big meal for the storm chasers. While there, the team discusses Bill\u2019s past as a sometimes heavy drinker with no fear and informs Melissa about Jo's backstory, explaining that Jo has since become obsessed with ensuring nobody else suffers the same fate as her father. Jo, realizing she is falling in love with Bill again, isolates herself from the rest of the group and is confronted by Aunt Meg, who tells her that no matter what happens, they will always end up together. They learn an [[Fujita scale|F3 tornado]] is quickly forming in a neighboring county, forcing them to hit the road once again.\n\nAs the team attempts to intercept the F3, the tornado fails to appear and they begin to drive blindly through thick [[hail]]. They make yet another attempt to deploy a DOROTHY unit, but the tornado forms on top of them, damaging the truck and destroying DOROTHY II in the process. Overwhelmed by these recent events and racked with guilt over her father's death, Jo begins to despair. As their emotions run high, Bill tells Jo that he's still in love with her, unaware that Melissa is hearing the conversation over [[Citizens band radio|CB radio]].\n\nThat night, the team stays in a hotel next to a [[drive-in cinema]], which is showing [[Stanley Kubrick|Stanley Kubrick's]] 1980 film ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]''. Jo decides to fill out the remaining divorce papers but is interrupted when an [[Fujita scale|F4 tornado]] forms nearby, forcing her team as well as townspeople caught in the storm to take shelter. The theater, a repair shop, and much of the team\u2019s equipment is heavily damaged. Finding herself traumatized by the recent near-death experiences and recognizing the re-blossoming love between Bill and Jo, Melissa peacefully ends her relationship with Bill and makes her own way home. The tornado continues on to devastate the town of Wakita, injuring Aunt Meg and flattening her home. While her injuries do not appear serious, she is taken to a nearby hospital and pushes Jo not to give up, reminding her of Wakita having essentially been hit blind by the tornado as they had no warning, the [[civil defense siren|tornado sirens]] having barely gone off before it struck. The team hears that an F5 is forming close by and in a brief moment of quiet, Jo absently watches Aunt Meg's wind chimes. The image inspires an epiphany in her and she begins to form a plan to improve and deploy the next DOROTHY unit.\n\nAs the sun starts to rise, the team sets out to intercept the F5 tornado, which has grown to be over a mile wide. Bill and Jo lay the newly-altered DOROTHY III directly in the F5's path, but it is destroyed by an uprooted tree. Meanwhile, Jonas attempts to deploy DOT-3 in a similar fashion, ignoring Bill's repeated warnings that his team is too close and that the tornado is shifting directly towards them. A metal tower impales Jonas' driver, Eddie, and their vehicle is swept into the tornado and thrown to the ground, killing both men and destroying DOT-3 in the resulting explosion. Bill and Jo press on, realizing that the only way to successfully deploy DOROTHY IV is by driving directly into the tornado and jumping out before Bill's truck is swept away. The plan works and the rest of the team celebrates the successful deployment of DOROTHY IV. However, Bill and Jo's celebration is cut short when the F5 shifts direction towards them. They flee into the nearby cornfields and take shelter in a water pump facility, fastening themselves to deeply rooted pipes. As the tornado passes overhead, they are able to see the interior of the tornado, before the storm dissipates altogether. The rest of the team arrives on scene to celebrate the achievement while Jo and Bill excitedly plan the next phase of research, deciding to run their own lab and rekindle their marriage.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Helen Hunt]] as Dr. Joanne \"Jo\" Harding\n** [[Alexa PenaVega|Alexa Vega]] as Young Jo Thornton\n* [[Bill Paxton]] as Bill \"The Extreme\" Harding\n* [[Jami Gertz]] as Dr. Melissa Reeves\n* [[Cary Elwes]] as Dr. Jonas Miller\n* [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] as \"Dusty\" Davis\n* [[Alan Ruck]] as Robert \"Rabbit\" Nurick\n* [[Sean Whalen]] as Allan Sanders\n* [[Jeremy Davies]] as Brian Laurence\n* [[Joey Slotnick]] as Joey\n* [[Todd Field]] as Tim \"Beltzer\" Lewis\n* [[Scott Thomson (actor)|Scott Thomson]] as Jason \"Preacher\" Rowe\n* Wendle Josepher as Patty Haynes\n* [[Lois Smith]] as Aunt Meg Greene\n* [[Zach Grenier]] as Eddie\n* [[Richard Lineback]] as Mr. Thornton\n* [[Rusty Schwimmer]] as Mrs. Thornton\n* [[Jake Busey]] as Mobile Lab Technician\n* [[Abraham Benrubi]] as Bubba, the Mobile Lab Driver\n\n{{div col end}}[[Gary England]], Jeff Lazalier, and [[Rick Mitchell (meteorologist)|Rick Mitchell]] appear as themselves on local television news reports.<ref name=GE>{{cite web|title=Gary England|url=http://www.news9.com/Global/story.asp?S=7449859|work=News 9|accessdate=22 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\n\n''Twister'' was produced by [[Steven Spielberg]]'s [[Amblin Entertainment]], with financial backing from [[Warner Bros.]] and [[Universal Pictures]].

Steven Spielberg then presented the concept to writer [[Michael Crichton]]. Crichton and his wife, Anne-Marie Martin, were paid a reported $2.5 million to write the screenplay.\n\nAfter spending more than half a year of pre-production on ''[[Godzilla (1998 film)|Godzilla]]'', director [[Jan de Bont]] left the project after a dispute over its budget, and quickly signed on for ''Twister''.<ref name=\"Daly\">{{cite news|url=https://ew.com/article/1996/05/17/twister-set-got-stormy/|title=The War of the Winds|last=Daly|first=Steve|date=May 10, 1996|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=June 14, 2009|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018030610/https://ew.com/article/1996/05/17/twister-set-got-stormy/|archive-date=October 18, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe production was plagued with problems. [[Joss Whedon]] was brought in to do rewrites through the early spring of 1995. When he got [[bronchitis]], [[Steven Zaillian]] was brought in. Whedon returned and worked on revisions right through the start of shooting in May 1995, then left the project after getting married. Two weeks into production, [[Jeff Nathanson]] was flown to the set and worked on the script until principal photography ended.<ref name=\"Daly\" />\n\nFilming was to originally take place in California, but De Bont insisted the film be shot on location in [[Oklahoma]]. Shooting commenced all over the state; several scenes, including the opening scene where the characters meet each other, as well as the first tornado chase in the Jeep pickup, were filmed in [[Fairfax, Oklahoma]] and [[Ralston, Oklahoma]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmaps.com/twister-f-2083/|title=Where was Twister filmed - Discover the Twister film locations with filmaps|website=www.filmaps.com}}</ref> The scene at the automotive repair shop was filmed in [[Maysville, Oklahoma]] and [[Norman, Oklahoma]]. The waterspouts were filmed on [[Kaw Lake]] near [[Kaw City, Oklahoma]]. The drive-in scene was filmed at a real drive-in theater in [[Guthrie, Oklahoma]], though some of the scene, such as Melissa's hotel room, was filmed in [[Stillwater, Oklahoma]] near [[Oklahoma State University]]'s campus. The real town of [[Wakita, Oklahoma]] was used during filming, and a section of the older part of town was demolished for the film. Additional scenes and B-roll were filmed near [[Ponca City]] and [[Pauls Valley, Oklahoma]], among several other smaller farm towns across the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news9.com/story/34609042/oklahoma-town-remembers-twister-star-bill-paxton|title=Oklahoma Town Remembers \u2018Twister\u2019 Star Bill Paxton|last=Stein|first=Deanne|date=February 26, 2017|website=News 9|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> However, due to changing seasons that massively transformed the look of Oklahoma's topography, filming was moved to [[Iowa]].

Paxton remembers that \"these things literally sunburned our eyeballs. I got back to my room, I couldn't see\".<ref name=\"Daly\" /> To solve the problem, a Plexiglas filter was placed in front of the beams. The actors took eye drops and wore special glasses for a few days to recuperate. After filming in a particularly unsanitary ditch, Hunt and Paxton needed hepatitis shots. During the same sequence, Hunt repeatedly hit her head on a low wooden bridge, so exhausted from the demanding shoot that she forgot not to stand up so quickly.<ref name=\"Daly\" /> During one stunt in which Hunt opened the door of a vehicle speeding through a cornfield, she momentarily let go of the door and it struck her on the side of the head. Some sources claim she received a concussion in the incident. De Bont said, \"I love Helen to death, but you know, she can be also a little bit clumsy. \" She responded, \"Clumsy? The guy burned my retinas, but I'm clumsy ... I thought I was a good sport. I don't know ultimately if Jan chalks me up as that or not, but one would hope so\".<ref name=\"Daly\" />\n\nSome crew members, feeling De Bont was \"out of control\", left the shoot five weeks into filming.<ref name=\"Daly\" /> The camera crew led by [[Don Burgess (cinematographer)|Don Burgess]] claimed De Bont \"didn't know what he wanted till he saw it. He would shoot one direction, with all the equipment behind the view of the camera, and then he'd want to shoot in the other direction right away and we'd have to move [everything] and he'd get angry that we took too long ... and it was always everybody else's fault, never his\".<ref name=\"Daly\" /> De Bont claims that they had to schedule at least three scenes every day because the weather changed so often, and \"Don had trouble adjusting to that\".<ref name=\"Daly\" /> When De Bont knocked over a camera assistant in a fit of rage who missed a cue, Burgess and his crew walked off the set, much to the shock of the cast. They remained one more week until [[Jack N. Green]]'s crew agreed to replace them. Two days before the end of filming, Green was injured when a hydraulic house set, designed to collapse on cue, was mistakenly activated with him inside it. A rigged ceiling hit him in the head and injured his back, requiring him to be hospitalized. De Bont took over as his own director of photography for the remaining shots.<ref name=\"Daly\" />\n\nBecause overcast skies were not always available, De Bont had to shoot many of the film's tornado-chasing scenes in bright sunlight, requiring [[Industrial Light & Magic]] to more than double its original plan for 150 \"digital sky-replacement\" shots.<ref name=\"Daly\" /> Principal photography was originally given a deadline to allow Hunt to return to appear in another season of ''[[Mad About You]]'', but when shooting ran over schedule, series creator and actor [[Paul Reiser]] agreed to delay the show's production for two-and-a-half weeks so ''Twister'' could finish. De Bont insisted on using multiple cameras, which led to the exposure of 1.3&nbsp;million feet of film, compared to the usual maximum of 300,000 feet.<ref name=\"Daly\" />\n\nDe Bont claims that ''Twister'' cost close to $70&nbsp;million, of which $2\u20133&nbsp;million went to the director. It was speculated that last-minute re-shoots in March and April 1996 (to clarify a scene about Jo as a child) and overtime requirements in post-production and at ILM, raised the budget to $90&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"Daly\" /> Warner Bros. moved up the film's release date from May 17 to 10, to give it two weekends before ''[[Mission: Impossible (film)|Mission: Impossible]]'' opened.\n\n''Twister'' is known for its successful [[product placement]], featuring a Dodge Ram pickup truck and several other new vehicle models.\n\nPrints of ''Twister'' came with a note from De Bont, suggesting that exhibitors play the film at a higher volume than normal for full effect.\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n\n''Twister'' featured both a traditional orchestral film score by [[Mark Mancina]] and several [[rock music]] songs, including an instrumental theme song composed and performed for the film by [[Van Halen]].

Its [[executive producer]]s were [[Steven Spielberg]], [[Walter Parkes]], [[Laurie MacDonald]] and [[Gerald R. Molen]]. The film stars [[Helen Hunt]], [[Bill Paxton]], [[Jami Gertz]] and [[Cary Elwes]], and depicts a group of [[Storm chasing|storm chasers]] researching [[Tornado|tornadoes]] during a [[Tornado outbreak|severe outbreak]] in Oklahoma. \n\n''Twister'' grossed $494.5 million worldwide, and became the [[1996 in film#Highest-grossing films|second-highest-grossing film of 1996]]; an estimated 54.7 million tickets were sold in the US.<ref name=\"BoxOfficeMojo\" /> The film was met with a mixed critical reception, receiving criticism for its screenplay and praise for its visual effects and sound design. The film received [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound]], but lost both to ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]'' and ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]'' respectively.\n\n==Plot==\nIn June 1969 [[Oklahoma]], young Jo Thornton and her family are awakened by an approaching [[Fujita scale|F5 tornado]]. The family seeks refuge in their storm cellar, but the tornado rips the cellar door off and pulls Jo's father to his death while Jo and her mother look on. The next morning, they awake to find their farmhouse destroyed. \n\nIn the present day, 27 years after the death of Jo's father, the [[National Severe Storms Laboratory]] predicts a record outbreak of tornadoes in Oklahoma over a 24-hour period. Now an adult, Jo, a [[meteorology|meteorologist]] and [[storm chasing|storm chaser]], is reunited with her estranged husband, Bill Harding, a former weather researcher and fellow storm chaser, who has since moved on to become a popular television weather reporter. He has a brand new [[Dodge Ram]] pickup truck and is planning to marry reproductive therapist Melissa Reeves. However, his plans are delayed until Jo signs her long overdue divorce papers. Arriving to Jo's camp in order to get her to complete the forms, he finds that she and her team have built four tornado research devices called DOROTHY based on Bill's groundbreaking design. Each unit contains hundreds of sensors that, if picked up by a tornado, will provide data that could lead to revolutionary breakthroughs in meteorological research. Before Jo can finish the paperwork, her team rushes to intercept a nearby forming [[Fujita scale|F1 tornado]], forcing Bill and Melissa to chase after her. Bill encounters Dr. Jonas Miller, a corporate-funded meteorologist and long-time rival storm chaser, and learns that he has created a device called DOT-3, a blatant copy of DOROTHY. Bill vows to help Jo deploy DOROTHY before Jonas can deploy DOT-3 and claim credit for the idea.\n\nIn an attempt to deploy DOROTHY and get back to his regular life, Bill maneuvers Jo's [[Jeep Gladiator]] off-road into a muddy ditch towards the rapidly growing tornado. They collide with a small wooden bridge and find themselves trapped in the direct path of the oncoming tornado. As they take cover, Jo's truck and DOROTHY I are both picked up and destroyed by the tornado.\n\nA second tornado is spotted in another part of Oklahoma, and they continue on in Bill's Dodge with Melissa, who has no choice but to tag along in the backseat. Jonas and his team are also moving to intercept the storm cell, which has at this point grown into an [[Fujita scale|F2 tornado]]. However, Bill's intuition that the tornado will shift towards another direction sends them off seemingly in the wrong direction. He is quickly vindicated, which sends Jonas into a fit of rage. The team is then led off-road, eventually hanging back as the storm cell worsens, while Bill, Jo, and Melissa have a dangerous encounter with twin [[waterspout]] tornadoes on a enclosed road and they're spun round, which leaves Melissa shaken. The rest of the team, however, is ecstatic about the encounter and convince Jo to let them go visit Jo's Aunt Meg in the nearby town of [[Wakita, Oklahoma|Wakita]] for food and rest.\n\nThe team arrives in Wakita, where Aunt Meg prepares a big meal for the storm chasers. While there, the team discusses Bill\u2019s past as a sometimes heavy drinker with no fear and informs Melissa about Jo's backstory, explaining that Jo has since become obsessed with ensuring nobody else suffers the same fate as her father. Jo, realizing she is falling in love with Bill again, isolates herself from the rest of the group and is confronted by Aunt Meg, who tells her that no matter what happens, they will always end up together. They learn an [[Fujita scale|F3 tornado]] is quickly forming in a neighboring county, forcing them to hit the road once again.\n\nAs the team attempts to intercept the F3, the tornado fails to appear and they begin to drive blindly through thick [[hail]]. They make yet another attempt to deploy a DOROTHY unit, but the tornado forms on top of them, damaging the truck and destroying DOROTHY II in the process. Overwhelmed by these recent events and racked with guilt over her father's death, Jo begins to despair. As their emotions run high, Bill tells Jo that he's still in love with her, unaware that Melissa is hearing the conversation over [[Citizens band radio|CB radio]].\n\nThat night, the team stays in a hotel next to a [[drive-in cinema]], which is showing [[Stanley Kubrick|Stanley Kubrick's]] 1980 film ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]''. Jo decides to fill out the remaining divorce papers but is interrupted when an [[Fujita scale|F4 tornado]] forms nearby, forcing her team as well as townspeople caught in the storm to take shelter. The theater, a repair shop, and much of the team\u2019s equipment is heavily damaged. Finding herself traumatized by the recent near-death experiences and recognizing the re-blossoming love between Bill and Jo, Melissa peacefully ends her relationship with Bill and makes her own way home. The tornado continues on to devastate the town of Wakita, injuring Aunt Meg and flattening her home. While her injuries do not appear serious, she is taken to a nearby hospital and pushes Jo not to give up, reminding her of Wakita having essentially been hit blind by the tornado as they had no warning, the [[civil defense siren|tornado sirens]] having barely gone off before it struck. The team hears that an F5 is forming close by and in a brief moment of quiet, Jo absently watches Aunt Meg's wind chimes. The image inspires an epiphany in her and she begins to form a plan to improve and deploy the next DOROTHY unit.\n\nAs the sun starts to rise, the team sets out to intercept the F5 tornado, which has grown to be over a mile wide. Bill and Jo lay the newly-altered DOROTHY III directly in the F5's path, but it is destroyed by an uprooted tree. Meanwhile, Jonas attempts to deploy DOT-3 in a similar fashion, ignoring Bill's repeated warnings that his team is too close and that the tornado is shifting directly towards them. A metal tower impales Jonas' driver, Eddie, and their vehicle is swept into the tornado and thrown to the ground, killing both men and destroying DOT-3 in the resulting explosion. Bill and Jo press on, realizing that the only way to successfully deploy DOROTHY IV is by driving directly into the tornado and jumping out before Bill's truck is swept away. The plan works and the rest of the team celebrates the successful deployment of DOROTHY IV. However, Bill and Jo's celebration is cut short when the F5 shifts direction towards them. They flee into the nearby cornfields and take shelter in a water pump facility, fastening themselves to deeply rooted pipes. As the tornado passes overhead, they are able to see the interior of the tornado, before the storm dissipates altogether. The rest of the team arrives on scene to celebrate the achievement while Jo and Bill excitedly plan the next phase of research, deciding to run their own lab and rekindle their marriage.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Helen Hunt]] as Dr. Joanne \"Jo\" Harding\n** [[Alexa PenaVega|Alexa Vega]] as Young Jo Thornton\n* [[Bill Paxton]] as Bill \"The Extreme\" Harding\n* [[Jami Gertz]] as Dr. Melissa Reeves\n* [[Cary Elwes]] as Dr. Jonas Miller\n* [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] as \"Dusty\" Davis\n* [[Alan Ruck]] as Robert \"Rabbit\" Nurick\n* [[Sean Whalen]] as Allan Sanders\n* [[Jeremy Davies]] as Brian Laurence\n* [[Joey Slotnick]] as Joey\n* [[Todd Field]] as Tim \"Beltzer\" Lewis\n* [[Scott Thomson (actor)|Scott Thomson]] as Jason \"Preacher\" Rowe\n* Wendle Josepher as Patty Haynes\n* [[Lois Smith]] as Aunt Meg Greene\n* [[Zach Grenier]] as Eddie\n* [[Richard Lineback]] as Mr. Thornton\n* [[Rusty Schwimmer]] as Mrs. Thornton\n* [[Jake Busey]] as Mobile Lab Technician\n* [[Abraham Benrubi]] as Bubba, the Mobile Lab Driver\n\n{{div col end}}[[Gary England]], Jeff Lazalier, and [[Rick Mitchell (meteorologist)|Rick Mitchell]] appear as themselves on local television news reports.<ref name=GE>{{cite web|title=Gary England|url=http://www.news9.com/Global/story.asp?S=7449859|work=News 9|accessdate=22 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\n\n''Twister'' was produced by [[Steven Spielberg]]'s [[Amblin Entertainment]], with financial backing from [[Warner Bros.]] and [[Universal Pictures]]. In return, Warner Bros. was given the North American distribution rights while Universal's joint venture distribution company [[United International Pictures|UIP]] got the international distribution.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Masters|first1=Kim|title=Steven Spielberg on DreamWorks' Past, Amblin's Present and His Own Future|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/steven-spielberg-dreamworks-past-amblins-902544|accessdate=July 8, 2016|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=June 15, 2016}}</ref> The original concept and 10-page tornado-chaser story were presented to Amblin Entertainment in 1992 by screenwriter [[Jeffrey Hilton]]. Steven Spielberg then presented the concept to writer [[Michael Crichton]]. Crichton and his wife, Anne-Marie Martin, were paid a reported $2.5 million to write the screenplay.\n\nAfter spending more than half a year of pre-production on ''[[Godzilla (1998 film)|Godzilla]]'', director [[Jan de Bont]] left the project after a dispute over its budget, and quickly signed on for ''Twister''.<ref name=\"Daly\">{{cite news|url=https://ew.com/article/1996/05/17/twister-set-got-stormy/|title=The War of the Winds|last=Daly|first=Steve|date=May 10, 1996|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=June 14, 2009|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018030610/https://ew.com/article/1996/05/17/twister-set-got-stormy/|archive-date=October 18, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe production was plagued with problems. [[Joss Whedon]] was brought in to do rewrites through the early spring of 1995. When he got [[bronchitis]], [[Steven Zaillian]] was brought in. Whedon returned and worked on revisions right through the start of shooting in May 1995, then left the project after getting married. Two weeks into production, [[Jeff Nathanson]] was flown to the set and worked on the script until principal photography ended.<ref name=\"Daly\" />\n\nFilming was to originally take place in California, but De Bont insisted the film be shot on location in [[Oklahoma]]. Shooting commenced all over the state; several scenes, including the opening scene where the characters meet each other, as well as the first tornado chase in the Jeep pickup, were filmed in [[Fairfax, Oklahoma]] and [[Ralston, Oklahoma]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmaps.com/twister-f-2083/|title=Where was Twister filmed - Discover the Twister film locations with filmaps|website=www.filmaps.com}}</ref> The scene at the automotive repair shop was filmed in [[Maysville, Oklahoma]] and [[Norman, Oklahoma]]. The waterspouts were filmed on [[Kaw Lake]] near [[Kaw City, Oklahoma]]. The drive-in scene was filmed at a real drive-in theater in [[Guthrie, Oklahoma]], though some of the scene, such as Melissa's hotel room, was filmed in [[Stillwater, Oklahoma]] near [[Oklahoma State University]]'s campus. The real town of [[Wakita, Oklahoma]] was used during filming, and a section of the older part of town was demolished for the film. Additional scenes and B-roll were filmed near [[Ponca City]] and [[Pauls Valley, Oklahoma]], among several other smaller farm towns across the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news9.com/story/34609042/oklahoma-town-remembers-twister-star-bill-paxton|title=Oklahoma Town Remembers \u2018Twister\u2019 Star Bill Paxton|last=Stein|first=Deanne|date=February 26, 2017|website=News 9|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> However, due to changing seasons that massively transformed the look of Oklahoma's topography, filming was moved to [[Iowa]].

Paxton remembers that \"these things literally sunburned our eyeballs. I got back to my room, I couldn't see\".<ref name=\"Daly\" /> To solve the problem, a Plexiglas filter was placed in front of the beams. The actors took eye drops and wore special glasses for a few days to recuperate. After filming in a particularly unsanitary ditch, Hunt and Paxton needed hepatitis shots. During the same sequence, Hunt repeatedly hit her head on a low wooden bridge, so exhausted from the demanding shoot that she forgot not to stand up so quickly.<ref name=\"Daly\" /> During one stunt in which Hunt opened the door of a vehicle speeding through a cornfield, she momentarily let go of the door and it struck her on the side of the head. Some sources claim she received a concussion in the incident. De Bont said, \"I love Helen to death, but you know, she can be also a little bit clumsy. \" She responded, \"Clumsy? The guy burned my retinas, but I'm clumsy ... I thought I was a good sport. I don't know ultimately if Jan chalks me up as that or not, but one would hope so\".<ref name=\"Daly\" />\n\nSome crew members, feeling De Bont was \"out of control\", left the shoot five weeks into filming.<ref name=\"Daly\" /> The camera crew led by [[Don Burgess (cinematographer)|Don Burgess]] claimed De Bont \"didn't know what he wanted till he saw it. He would shoot one direction, with all the equipment behind the view of the camera, and then he'd want to shoot in the other direction right away and we'd have to move [everything] and he'd get angry that we took too long ... and it was always everybody else's fault, never his\".<ref name=\"Daly\" /> De Bont claims that they had to schedule at least three scenes every day because the weather changed so often, and \"Don had trouble adjusting to that\".<ref name=\"Daly\" /> When De Bont knocked over a camera assistant in a fit of rage who missed a cue, Burgess and his crew walked off the set, much to the shock of the cast. They remained one more week until [[Jack N. Green]]'s crew agreed to replace them. Two days before the end of filming, Green was injured when a hydraulic house set, designed to collapse on cue, was mistakenly activated with him inside it. A rigged ceiling hit him in the head and injured his back, requiring him to be hospitalized. De Bont took over as his own director of photography for the remaining shots.<ref name=\"Daly\" />\n\nBecause overcast skies were not always available, De Bont had to shoot many of the film's tornado-chasing scenes in bright sunlight, requiring [[Industrial Light & Magic]] to more than double its original plan for 150 \"digital sky-replacement\" shots.<ref name=\"Daly\" /> Principal photography was originally given a deadline to allow Hunt to return to appear in another season of ''[[Mad About You]]'', but when shooting ran over schedule, series creator and actor [[Paul Reiser]] agreed to delay the show's production for two-and-a-half weeks so ''Twister'' could finish. De Bont insisted on using multiple cameras, which led to the exposure of 1.3&nbsp;million feet of film, compared to the usual maximum of 300,000 feet.<ref name=\"Daly\" />\n\nDe Bont claims that ''Twister'' cost close to $70&nbsp;million, of which $2\u20133&nbsp;million went to the director. It was speculated that last-minute re-shoots in March and April 1996 (to clarify a scene about Jo as a child) and overtime requirements in post-production and at ILM, raised the budget to $90&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"Daly\" /> Warner Bros. moved up the film's release date from May 17 to 10, to give it two weekends before ''[[Mission: Impossible (film)|Mission: Impossible]]'' opened.\n\n''Twister'' is known for its successful [[product placement]], featuring a Dodge Ram pickup truck and several other new vehicle models.\n\nPrints of ''Twister'' came with a note from De Bont, suggesting that exhibitors play the film at a higher volume than normal for full effect.\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n\n''Twister'' featured both a traditional orchestral film score by [[Mark Mancina]] and several [[rock music]] songs, including an instrumental theme song composed and performed for the film by [[Van Halen]]. The film's music was released on [[compact disc]].\n\n=== Twister: Music from the Motion Picture Soundtrack ===\n\n# [[Van Halen]] \u2013 \"[[Humans Being]]\"\n# [[Deep Purple ]] -\"[[Child In Time]]\" \n# [[Rusted Root]] \u2013 \"Virtual Reality\"\n# [[Tori Amos]] \u2013 \"[[Talula]]\" (BT's Tornado Mix)\n# [[Alison Krauss]] \u2013 \"Moments Like This\"\n# [[Mark Knopfler]] \u2013 \"[[Darling Pretty]]\"\n# [[Soul Asylum]] \u2013 \"Miss This\"\n# [[Belly (band)|Belly]] \u2013 \"Broken\"\n# [[k.d. lang]] \u2013 \"Love Affair\"\n# [[Lisa Loeb & Nine Stories]] \u2013 \"How\"\n# [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] \u2013 \"Melancholy Mechanics\"\n# [[Goo Goo Dolls]] \u2013 \"[[Long Way Down (Goo Goo Dolls song)|Long Way Down]]\" (Remix)\n# [[Shania Twain]] \u2013 \"[[No One Needs to Know]]\"\n# [[Stevie Nicks]] & [[Lindsey Buckingham]] \u2013 \"[[Twisted (Stevie Nicks song)|Twisted]]\"\n# [[Edward Van Halen|Edward]] & [[Alex Van Halen]] \u2013 \"Respect the Wind\"\n\nThere is also some other music, such as [[Deep Purple]]'s \"[[Child in Time]]\" (heard when the team takes the road at the beginning and the assistant maximises the volume in his truck).\n\nThe song queued up on a TV in Dusty's van is [[Eric Clapton]]'s \"Motherless Child\".\n\n=== Twister: Motion Picture Score ===\n\n# Oklahoma: Wheatfield\n# Oklahoma: Where's My Truck?\n# Oklahoma: Futility\n# Oklahoma: Downdraft\n# It's Coming: Drive In\n# It's Coming: The Big Suck\n# The Hunt: Going Green (feat.

When it was officially operational in June the following year, it was declared as one of, if not the best, prisons throughout the vast British Empire. The design of the prison was based off a \"T\"-shaped structure, with two cell-block wings stretching out from a central main block (for administration areas and warden-offices), to allow for quick and easy access to either cell-block wing for the wardens whenever necessary (from up above, the prison buildings formed the shape of the top of a telegram/telephone pole). Changi Prison also boasted the use of an advanced and extensive alarm system and had electrical lighting in its cells along with flush-toilets in each. The prison had a holding capacity of 600.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], following the [[Battle of Singapore|Fall of Singapore]] in February 1942, the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] military detained about 3,000 civilians in Changi Prison, which was built to house only one-fifth of that number. The Japanese used the [[British Army]]'s [[Selarang Barracks incident|Selarang Barracks]], near the prison, as a [[prisoner of war]] camp, holding some 50,000 [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] soldiers, predominantly British and Australian, and from 1943, Dutch civilians brought over by the Japanese from the islands in the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now [[Indonesia]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://habitatnews.nus.edu.sg/heritage/changi/war/hackblackburn.html |title=Changi Heritage: Changi and the War |website=Habitatnews.nus.edu.sg |accessdate=3 December 2016}}</ref> [[POW]]s were in fact rarely, if ever, held in the civilian prison at Changi. Nevertheless, in the UK, Australia, The Netherlands and elsewhere, the name \"Changi\" became synonymous with the [[Selarang Barracks incident|infamous POW camp]] nearby, since most of the Japanese prisons were in the Changi area. Around 500 detainees were women who had been separated with their children and marched to the cramped prison camp from their homes. These women and also girls sewed quilts for the prison hospital, daringly [[Embroidery|embroidering]] their own secret symbols and stories into the squares, including forget-me-nots, butterflies, angels, scenery of trees and sheep, other symbolic flowers and even a domestic sitting room, ships, birds and a map of [[Scotland]], and one of [[Australia]]. They risked severe punishments by [[Needlework|sewing]] depicting their prison environment and adding dozens, or even over 400 names, in one case onto the cloths. One depicted the Changi Stroll, the forced march of the captive women and children over 9 miles to the prison under the occupation by the Japanese on 8th March 1942, coincidentally now [[International Women's Day]] commemorating women and the defiance of the [[Suffragette|suffragettes]].

Harry Stodgen, built a [[Christian cross]] out of a used artillery shell. After the war, the chapel was dismantled and shipped to Australia, while the cross was sent to the UK.

Executions were conducted in the inner yard where three gallows were erected. British soldiers were stationed there as prison guards. On 17 October 1945, all 260 German seamen of former [[U-Boats]] based in Southeast Asia (in joint operations with the Imperial Japanese Navy during the war) were moved from [[Pasir Panjang]] to the prison. On 26 June 1946, all German soldiers and a few civilians were notified they would be shipped back to England on a passenger liner, the [[RMS Empress of Australia (1919)|''Empress of Australia'']], before their eventual return to Germany.<ref name=Giese>Giese, O., 1994, ''Shooting the war: The memoir and photographs of a U-boat officer in World War II'', Annapolis: [[United States Naval Institute]], {{ISBN|1557503079}}</ref>{{rp|245\u2013252}}\n\n====Kempeitai====\n\nThe prison also contained the headquarters of the [[Kempeitai]], the Japanese military police.

When it was officially operational in June the following year, it was declared as one of, if not the best, prisons throughout the vast British Empire. The design of the prison was based off a \"T\"-shaped structure, with two cell-block wings stretching out from a central main block (for administration areas and warden-offices), to allow for quick and easy access to either cell-block wing for the wardens whenever necessary (from up above, the prison buildings formed the shape of the top of a telegram/telephone pole). Changi Prison also boasted the use of an advanced and extensive alarm system and had electrical lighting in its cells along with flush-toilets in each. The prison had a holding capacity of 600.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], following the [[Battle of Singapore|Fall of Singapore]] in February 1942, the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] military detained about 3,000 civilians in Changi Prison, which was built to house only one-fifth of that number. The Japanese used the [[British Army]]'s [[Selarang Barracks incident|Selarang Barracks]], near the prison, as a [[prisoner of war]] camp, holding some 50,000 [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] soldiers, predominantly British and Australian, and from 1943, Dutch civilians brought over by the Japanese from the islands in the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now [[Indonesia]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://habitatnews.nus.edu.sg/heritage/changi/war/hackblackburn.html |title=Changi Heritage: Changi and the War |website=Habitatnews.nus.edu.sg |accessdate=3 December 2016}}</ref> [[POW]]s were in fact rarely, if ever, held in the civilian prison at Changi. Nevertheless, in the UK, Australia, The Netherlands and elsewhere, the name \"Changi\" became synonymous with the [[Selarang Barracks incident|infamous POW camp]] nearby, since most of the Japanese prisons were in the Changi area. Around 500 detainees were women who had been separated with their children and marched to the cramped prison camp from their homes. These women and also girls sewed quilts for the prison hospital, daringly [[Embroidery|embroidering]] their own secret symbols and stories into the squares, including forget-me-nots, butterflies, angels, scenery of trees and sheep, other symbolic flowers and even a domestic sitting room, ships, birds and a map of [[Scotland]], and one of [[Australia]]. They risked severe punishments by [[Needlework|sewing]] depicting their prison environment and adding dozens, or even over 400 names, in one case onto the cloths. One depicted the Changi Stroll, the forced march of the captive women and children over 9 miles to the prison under the occupation by the Japanese on 8th March 1942, coincidentally now [[International Women's Day]] commemorating women and the defiance of the [[Suffragette|suffragettes]]. Surviving examples of the prison handiwork are in the archives of the [[British Red Cross]], [[Imperial War Museum]], London or held at the Australian War Memorial.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Threads of life : a history of the world through the eye of a needle|last=Hunter|first=Clare|publisher=Sceptre (Hodder & Stoughton)|year=2019|isbn=9781473687912|location=London|pages=50\u201358|oclc=1079199690}}</ref> About 850 POWs died during their internment in Changi during the [[Japanese occupation of Singapore]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/journal/j33/blackburn.htm |title=Journal of the Australian War Memorial &#124; Australian War Memorial |publisher=Awm.gov.au |accessdate=3 December 2016}}</ref> a relatively low rate compared to the overall death rate of 27% for [[List of Japanese-run internment camps during World War II|POWs in Japanese camps]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/wwii/articles/islandofdeath.aspx |title=Military History Online |publisher=Military History Online |accessdate=3 December 2016}}</ref> However, many more prisoners died after being transferred from Changi to various [[labour camp]]s outside Singapore, including those on the [[Burma Railway]] and at [[Sandakan Death Marches|Sandakan airfield]].\n[[File:Allied prisoners of war after the liberation of Changi Prison, Singapore - c. 1945 - 02.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Allied prisoners of war piling out of the main gate of the Changi Prison after the British liberation of Singapore in September of 1945]]\nAllied POWs, mainly Australians, built a chapel at the prison in 1944 using simple tools and found materials. [[Stanley Warren]] of the 15th Regiment, Royal Regiment of Artillery painted a series of [[Changi Murals|murals]] at the chapel. Another British POW, Sgt. Harry Stodgen, built a [[Christian cross]] out of a used artillery shell. After the war, the chapel was dismantled and shipped to Australia, while the cross was sent to the UK. The chapel was reconstructed in 1988, and is now located at the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], [[Canberra]]. The prisoners of war also established an education program nicknamed the [[Changi University]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/node/22368|title=Backgrounder: Memorial unveils one-of-a-kind Changi manuscript|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Australian War Memorial]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=7 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nAfter the war, the prison was used by the returning British to hold former Japanese staff officers, ''[[Kempeitai]]'', police and guards from concentration camps. Executions were conducted in the inner yard where three gallows were erected. British soldiers were stationed there as prison guards. On 17 October 1945, all 260 German seamen of former [[U-Boats]] based in Southeast Asia (in joint operations with the Imperial Japanese Navy during the war) were moved from [[Pasir Panjang]] to the prison. On 26 June 1946, all German soldiers and a few civilians were notified they would be shipped back to England on a passenger liner, the [[RMS Empress of Australia (1919)|''Empress of Australia'']], before their eventual return to Germany.<ref name=Giese>Giese, O., 1994, ''Shooting the war: The memoir and photographs of a U-boat officer in World War II'', Annapolis: [[United States Naval Institute]], {{ISBN|1557503079}}</ref>{{rp|245\u2013252}}\n\n====Kempeitai====\n\nThe prison also contained the headquarters of the [[Kempeitai]], the Japanese military police.

In view of its historical significance, the [[National Heritage Board (Singapore)|Preservation of Monuments Board]] worked with the [[Singapore Prison Service]] and the [[Urban Redevelopment Authority]] to allow the old prison's iconic front walls, front gates and two guard-towers at either end of the wall to be preserved.

Caning sessions at Changi are held twice per week. A former employee of the prison has been quoted in 1995 as saying: \"They are flogging more and more these days.
