The screenplay was written by [[Jim Cash]] and [[Jack Epps Jr.]], and was inspired by an article titled \"Top Guns\" published in ''[[California (magazine)|California]]'' magazine three years earlier. The film stars [[Tom Cruise]], [[Kelly McGillis]], [[Val Kilmer]], [[Anthony Edwards]], and [[Tom Skerritt]]. It also marked the debut of actor [[Adrian Pasdar]]. Cruise plays [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell, a young [[naval aviator]] aboard the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}}. He and his [[Radar Intercept Officer]], Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw (Edwards) are given the chance to train at the US Navy's [[United States Navy Strike Fighter Tactics Instructor program|Fighter Weapons School]] at [[Marine Corps Air Station Miramar#Naval Air Station|Naval Air Station Miramar]] in [[San Diego]], [[California]].\n\n''Top Gun'' was released on May 16, 1986. Upon its release, the film received generally mixed reviews from film critics but many particularly praised the action sequences, the effects, the aerial stunts, and the acting performances with Cruise and McGillis receiving the most praise. Four weeks after release, the number of theaters showing it increased by 45 percent.<ref name=bomweekly>{{cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekly&id=topgun.htm |title=Top Gun Weekly |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=boxofficemojo.com |access-date=2017-05-25}}</ref> Despite its initial mixed critical reaction, the film was a huge commercial hit grossing [[US$]]356 million against a production budget of only US$15 million. The film maintained its popularity over the years and earned an [[IMAX]] 3D re-release in 2013. Additionally, the film won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] for \"[[Take My Breath Away]]\" performed by [[Berlin (band)|Berlin]].\n\nIn 2015, the United States [[Library of Congress]] selected the film for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]], finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ghostbusters-top-gun-enter-national-849092|title='Ghostbusters,' 'Top Gun,' 'Shawshank' Enter National Film Registry|author=Mike Barnes|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=December 16, 2015|accessdate=December 16, 2015}}</ref> A sequel, titled ''[[Top Gun: Maverick]]'' is scheduled for release on December 23, 2020.<ref>{{cite news |last1=D'Alessandro |first1=Anthony |title=\u2018Top Gun Maverick\u2019 Flies To Christmas Corridor, \u2018SpongeBob\u2019 Eyes Late Summer, \u2018Quiet Place II\u2019 To Debut Labor Day |url=https://deadline.com/2020/04/top-gun-maverick-flies-to-christmas-corridor-spongebob-eyes-late-summer-quiet-place-ii-to-debut-labor-day-1202898738/ |accessdate=April 2, 2020 |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=April 2, 2020 |language=en}}</ref> \n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- NOTE: According to WP:FILMPLOT guidelines, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. -->\n\n[[United States Naval Aviator]] [[Lieutenant (navy)|LT]] Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell and his [[Radar Intercept Officer]] [[Lieutenant (junior grade)|LTJG]] Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw fly the [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|F-14A Tomcat]] aboard {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}}. During an interception with two hostile MiG-28 aircraft (portrayed by a [[Northrop F-5]]), Maverick gets missile lock on one, while the other hostile aircraft locks onto Maverick's wingman, Cougar. While Maverick drives off the remaining MiG-28, Cougar is too shaken to land, and Maverick, defying orders, shepherds him back to the carrier. Cougar gives up his [[Wings of Gold|wings]], citing his newborn child that he has never seen. Despite his dislike for Maverick's recklessness, [[Commander, Air Group|CAG]] \"Stinger\" sends him and Goose to attend Topgun{{sic}},<ref>https://www.fighterpilotpodcast.com/podcast/007-topgun-vs-top-gun/</ref> the Naval Fighter Weapons School at [[Naval Air Station Miramar]].\n\nAt a bar the day before Topgun starts, Maverick, assisted by Goose, unsuccessfully approaches a woman. Maverick learns the next day that she is Charlotte \"Charlie\" Blackwood, an [[Astrophysics|astrophysicist]] and civilian Topgun instructor. Charlie later becomes interested in Maverick upon learning of his inverted maneuver with the MiG-28, which disproves US intelligence on the enemy aircraft's performance.\n\nDuring Maverick's first training sortie he defeats instructor LCDR Rick \"Jester\" Heatherly but through reckless flying breaks two [[rules of engagement]] and is reprimanded by chief instructor CDR Mike \"Viper\" Metcalf. Privately, Jester confides that he admires Maverick's skill, but wouldn't trust him as a teammate in combat. Maverick also becomes a rival to top student LT Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky, who considers Maverick's attitude \"dangerous\"\u2014as Maverick's tendency to abandon his team and pursue reckless objectives makes him \"unsafe\" to fly with. In class, Charlie also objects to Maverick's aggressive tactics but privately admits to him that she admires his flying and omitted it from her reports to hide her feelings for him, and the two begin a romantic relationship.\n\nDuring a training sortie, Maverick abandons his wingman \"Hollywood\" to chase Viper, who is impressed with his flying abilities but is defeated when Viper maneuvers Maverick into a position from which his wingman Jester can shoot down Maverick from behind, demonstrating the value of teamwork over individual prowess. Jester publicly tells Maverick that his flying is excellent, but that he should \"never leave [his] wingman.\"\n\nMaverick and Iceman, now direct competitors for the Topgun Trophy, chase an [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk|A-4]] in a later training engagement. Maverick pressures Iceman to break off his engagement so he can shoot it down, but Maverick's F-14 flies through the [[Wake turbulence|jet wash]] of Iceman's aircraft and suffers a [[flameout]] of both engines, going into an unrecoverable [[spin (flight)|flat spin]].  Maverick and Goose [[ejection seat|eject]], but Goose hits the jettisoned [[aircraft canopy]] head-first and is killed.\n\nAlthough the board of inquiry clears Maverick of responsibility for Goose's death, he is overcome by guilt and his flying skill diminishes. Charlie and others attempt to console him, but Maverick considers retiring. He seeks advice from Viper, who reveals that he served with Maverick's father Duke Mitchell on {{USS|Oriskany|CV-34|6}} and was in the air battle in which Mitchell was killed. Contrary to official reports which faulted Mitchell, Viper reveals classified information that proves Mitchell died heroically and informs Maverick that he can succeed if he can regain his self-confidence. Maverick chooses to graduate, though Iceman wins the Top Gun Trophy.\n\nDuring the graduation party, Viper calls in the newly graduated aviators with the orders to deploy. Iceman, Hollywood, and Maverick are ordered to immediately return to ''Enterprise'' to deal with a \"crisis situation\", providing air support for the rescue of a stricken ship that has drifted into hostile waters.\n\nMaverick and Merlin (Cougar's former RIO) are assigned as back-up for F-14s flown by Iceman and Hollywood, despite Iceman's reservations over Maverick's state of mind. The subsequent hostile engagement with six MiGs sees Hollywood shot down; Maverick is scrambled alone due to a [[aircraft catapult|catapult]] failure and nearly retreats after encountering circumstances similar to those that caused Goose's death. Upon finally rejoining Iceman, the two are still badly outnumbered, but Maverick vocally refuses to leave Iceman without a wingman and manages to shoot down three MiGs. Iceman, shifting to offense also shoots one down, which forces the other two to flee. Upon their triumphant return to ''Enterprise'', Iceman and Maverick share newfound respect in each other, and Maverick throws Goose's dog tags overboard.\n\nOffered any assignment he chooses, Maverick decides to return to Topgun as an instructor. At a bar in Miramar, Maverick and Charlie reunite.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- opening credits title card billing -->\n* [[Tom Cruise]] as LT Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell\n* [[Kelly McGillis]] as Charlotte \"Charlie\" Blackwood.

Numerous screenwriters allegedly turned down the project.<ref name=\"Top Gun Movie -The 80s Rewind\" /> Bruckheimer and Simpson went on to hire Jim Cash and Jack Epps, Jr., to write the first draft. The research methods, by Epps, included attendance at several declassified Topgun classes at Miramar and gaining experience by being flown in an F-14. The first draft failed to impress Bruckheimer and Simpson, and is considered to be very different from the final product in numerous ways.<ref>Special Edition DVD, Interview with Jack Epps</ref> Tony Scott was hired to direct on the strength of a commercial he had done for Swedish automaker [[Saab automobile|Saab]] in the early 1980s, where a [[Saab 900]] turbo is shown racing a [[Saab 37 Viggen]] fighter jet.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jets, jeans and Hovis|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/aug/24/1|newspaper=The Guardian|date=12 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nActor [[Matthew Modine]] turned down the role of [[Pete Mitchell (Top Gun)|LT Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell]] (that went to Tom Cruise) because he felt the film's pro-military stance went against his politics.

The Navy was influential in relation to script approval, which resulted in changes being made. The opening dogfight was moved to international waters as opposed to [[Cuba]], the language was toned down, and a scene that involved a crash on the deck of an aircraft carrier was also scrapped.<ref>Special Edition DVD, Interview with the producers</ref> Maverick's love interest was also changed from a female enlisted member of the Navy to a civilian contractor with the Navy, due to the US military's prohibition of fraternization between officers and enlisted personnel.<ref name=\"Top Gun Movie -The 80s Rewind\" /> The \"Charlie\" character also replaced an aerobics instructor from an early draft as a love interest for Maverick after producers were introduced to [[Christine Fox|Christine \"Legs\" Fox]], a civilian mathematician employed by the [[Center for Naval Analyses]] as a specialist in Maritime Air Superiority (MAS), developing tactics for aircraft carrier defense.<ref name=Richman1985/>\n\n[[Julianne Phillips]] was in consideration for the role of Charlie, and had been scheduled to perform a screen test opposite Tom Cruise.<ref name=AFI/>\n\nRear Admiral Pete \"Viper\" Pettigrew, a former Navy aviator, Vietnam War veteran, and Topgun instructor served as a technical advisor on the film, and also made a cameo appearance in the film as a colleague of Charlie's.\n\nFormer Top Gun instructor pilot and Congressman [[Duke Cunningham|Randy \"Duke\" Cunningham]] claimed to have been the inspiration for Pete Mitchell, although the film's producers have denied that the character was based on any specific Naval Aviator.<ref>{{cite news| first=Alex| last=Roth| newspaper=The San Diego Union-Tribune| url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/politics/cunningham/20060115-9999-lz1n15legend.html| title= down Cunningham's legend| date=2006-01-15| page=A-1| accessdate=2006-02-19}}</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[File:VF-111 TOPGUN MOVIE.jpg|thumb|F-14A Tomcats of Fighter Squadrons [[VF-51]] \"Screaming Eagles\" and [[VF-111 (1956-95)|VF-111]] \"Sundowners\", and F-5E/F Tiger IIs of the Navy Fighter Weapons School]]\n\nThe Navy made several aircraft from F-14 fighter squadron [[VF-51]] \"Screaming Eagles\" (which Tom Skerritt mentions in the scene at his home) available for the film.

During filming, director Tony Scott wanted to shoot aircraft landing and taking off, back-lit by the sun. During one particular filming sequence, the ship's commanding officer changed the ship's course, thus changing the light. When Scott asked if they could continue on their previous course and speed, he was informed by the commander that it cost US$25,000 (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|25000|1985|r=-3|fmt=c}} today) to turn the ship, and to continue on course. Scott wrote the carrier's captain a US$25,000 check so that the ship could be turned and he could continue shooting for another five minutes.<ref>Special Edition DVD, Interview with Tony Scott and Pete Pettigrew</ref>\n\n[[File:Filming of Top Gun movie (01) 1985.jpg|thumb|upright=.75|Filming and [[clapperboard]] of ''Top Gun'' on July 5, 1985.]]\n\nMost of the sequences of the aircraft maneuvering over land were shot at [[Naval Air Station Fallon]], in [[Nevada]], using ground-mounted cameras. Air-to-air shots were filmed using a [[Learjet]], piloted by Astrovision inventor and legendary pilot [[Clay Lacy]]. His name is misspelled in the closing credits, as Clay Lacey.

The first scene features Goose and Maverick singing \"[[Great Balls of Fire]]\" while seated at the piano. The final scene, where \"[[You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin']]\" can be heard on the restaurant's jukebox, was also filmed at the restaurant. Both scenes were filmed consecutively. After release of the movie, the restaurant went on to collect a significant amount of memorabilia from the motion picture until a kitchen fire on June 26, 2008, destroyed much of the restaurant. Some memorabilia and props, including the original piano used in the film, survived the fire, and the restaurant re-opened in November 2008.\n\nRenowned aerobatic pilot [[Art Scholl]] was hired to do in-flight camera work for the film. The original script called for a [[Spin (flight)|flat spin]], which Scholl was to perform and capture on a camera on the aircraft. The aircraft was observed to spin through its recovery altitude, at which time Scholl radioed \"I have a problem... I have a real problem\". He was unable to recover from the spin and crashed his [[Pitts Special]] bi-plane into the [[Pacific Ocean]] off the Southern California coast near [[Carlsbad, California|Carlsbad]] on September 16, 1985. Neither Scholl's body nor his aircraft was recovered, leaving the official cause of the accident unknown.<ref>Ashurst, Sam (November 4, 2008).

The [[Top Gun (1986 video game)|original game]] was released in 1986 under the same title as the film. It was released on [[Commodore 64]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]], and [[Atari ST]]. Another game, also titled ''[[Top Gun (1987 video game)|Top Gun]]'', was released in 1987 for [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) and [[Nintendo VS. System]] arcade cabinets. In the 1987 game, the player pilots an F-14 Tomcat fighter, and has to complete four missions. A sequel, ''Top Gun: The Second Mission'', was released for the NES three years later.\n\nAnother game, ''[[Top Gun: Fire at Will]]'', was released in 1996 for the PC and later for the [[PlayStation|Sony PlayStation]] platform. ''[[Top Gun: Hornet's Nest]]'' was released in 1998. ''[[Top Gun: Combat Zones]]'' was released for [[PlayStation 2]] in 2001 and was subsequently released for the [[GameCube]] and [[Microsoft Windows]]. ''Combat Zones'' features other aircraft besides the F-14. In 2006, another game simply titled ''Top Gun'' was released for the [[Nintendo DS]]. A 2010 game, also titled ''[[Top Gun (2010 video game)|Top Gun]]'', retells the film's story. At E3 2011, a new game was announced, ''Top Gun: Hard Lock'', which was released in March 2012 for [[Xbox 360]], PC, and [[PlayStation 3]].\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Top Gun (film, 1986)}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{AFI film|id=57496}}\n* {{IMDb title|0092099}}\n* {{tcmdb title|16475}}\n* [http://www.fandango.com/movie-news/top-gun-30th-anniversary-remember-the-movie-with-this-exclusive-artwork-750546 'Top Gun' 30th Anniversary Exclusive Art Work] on [[Fandango (ticket service)|Fandango]]\n* {{Allmovie title|50435}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|top_gun}}\n* [https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=topgun.htm Top Gun] at [[Box Office Mojo]]\n* [https://www.paramountmovies.com/movies/top-gun Paramount Movies]\n{{Tony Scott}}\n{{Jerry Bruckheimer}}\n\n[[Category:1986 films]]\n[[Category:1980s action drama films]]\n[[Category:2013 3D films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American aviation films]]\n[[Category:American action drama films]]\n[[Category:Films that won the Best Original Song Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Cold War aviation films]]\n[[Category:Films about aviators]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films based on newspaper and magazine articles]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Don Simpson]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Tony Scott]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Jerry Bruckheimer]]\n[[Category:Films set in San Diego]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Indian Ocean]]\n[[Category:Films shot in San Diego]]\n[[Category:IMAX films]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films about the United States Navy]]\n[[Category:United States National Film Registry films]]\n[[Category:Top Gun]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into video games]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Harold Faltermeyer]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Giorgio Moroder]]\n[[Category:3D re-releases]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the film}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=July 2019}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Top Gun\n| image          = Top Gun Movie.jpg\n| caption        = Theatrical release poster\n| director       = [[Tony Scott]]\n| producer       = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Don Simpson]]\n* [[Jerry Bruckheimer]]\n}}\n| writer         = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Jim Cash]]\n* [[Jack Epps Jr.]]\n}}\n| based on       = {{based on|''\"Top Guns\"''|Ehud Yonay}}\n| starring       = {{plainlist|\n* [[Tom Cruise]]\n* [[Kelly McGillis]]\n* [[Val Kilmer]]\n* [[Anthony Edwards]]\n* [[Tom Skerritt]]}}<!--NAMES ON POSTER ONLY-->\n| music          = [[Harold Faltermeyer]]\n| cinematography = [[Jeffrey L.

The screenplay was written by [[Jim Cash]] and [[Jack Epps Jr.]], and was inspired by an article titled \"Top Guns\" published in ''[[California (magazine)|California]]'' magazine three years earlier. The film stars [[Tom Cruise]], [[Kelly McGillis]], [[Val Kilmer]], [[Anthony Edwards]], and [[Tom Skerritt]]. It also marked the debut of actor [[Adrian Pasdar]]. Cruise plays [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell, a young [[naval aviator]] aboard the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}}. He and his [[Radar Intercept Officer]], Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw (Edwards) are given the chance to train at the US Navy's [[United States Navy Strike Fighter Tactics Instructor program|Fighter Weapons School]] at [[Marine Corps Air Station Miramar#Naval Air Station|Naval Air Station Miramar]] in [[San Diego]], [[California]].\n\n''Top Gun'' was released on May 16, 1986. Upon its release, the film received generally mixed reviews from film critics but many particularly praised the action sequences, the effects, the aerial stunts, and the acting performances with Cruise and McGillis receiving the most praise. Four weeks after release, the number of theaters showing it increased by 45 percent.<ref name=bomweekly>{{cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekly&id=topgun.htm |title=Top Gun Weekly |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=boxofficemojo.com |access-date=2017-05-25}}</ref> Despite its initial mixed critical reaction, the film was a huge commercial hit grossing [[US$]]356 million against a production budget of only US$15 million. The film maintained its popularity over the years and earned an [[IMAX]] 3D re-release in 2013. Additionally, the film won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] for \"[[Take My Breath Away]]\" performed by [[Berlin (band)|Berlin]].\n\nIn 2015, the United States [[Library of Congress]] selected the film for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]], finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ghostbusters-top-gun-enter-national-849092|title='Ghostbusters,' 'Top Gun,' 'Shawshank' Enter National Film Registry|author=Mike Barnes|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=December 16, 2015|accessdate=December 16, 2015}}</ref> A sequel, titled ''[[Top Gun: Maverick]]'' is scheduled for release on December 23, 2020.<ref>{{cite news |last1=D'Alessandro |first1=Anthony |title=\u2018Top Gun Maverick\u2019 Flies To Christmas Corridor, \u2018SpongeBob\u2019 Eyes Late Summer, \u2018Quiet Place II\u2019 To Debut Labor Day |url=https://deadline.com/2020/04/top-gun-maverick-flies-to-christmas-corridor-spongebob-eyes-late-summer-quiet-place-ii-to-debut-labor-day-1202898738/ |accessdate=April 2, 2020 |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=April 2, 2020 |language=en}}</ref> \n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- NOTE: According to WP:FILMPLOT guidelines, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. -->\n\n[[United States Naval Aviator]] [[Lieutenant (navy)|LT]] Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell and his [[Radar Intercept Officer]] [[Lieutenant (junior grade)|LTJG]] Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw fly the [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|F-14A Tomcat]] aboard {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}}. During an interception with two hostile MiG-28 aircraft (portrayed by a [[Northrop F-5]]), Maverick gets missile lock on one, while the other hostile aircraft locks onto Maverick's wingman, Cougar. While Maverick drives off the remaining MiG-28, Cougar is too shaken to land, and Maverick, defying orders, shepherds him back to the carrier. Cougar gives up his [[Wings of Gold|wings]], citing his newborn child that he has never seen. Despite his dislike for Maverick's recklessness, [[Commander, Air Group|CAG]] \"Stinger\" sends him and Goose to attend Topgun{{sic}},<ref>https://www.fighterpilotpodcast.com/podcast/007-topgun-vs-top-gun/</ref> the Naval Fighter Weapons School at [[Naval Air Station Miramar]].\n\nAt a bar the day before Topgun starts, Maverick, assisted by Goose, unsuccessfully approaches a woman. Maverick learns the next day that she is Charlotte \"Charlie\" Blackwood, an [[Astrophysics|astrophysicist]] and civilian Topgun instructor. Charlie later becomes interested in Maverick upon learning of his inverted maneuver with the MiG-28, which disproves US intelligence on the enemy aircraft's performance.\n\nDuring Maverick's first training sortie he defeats instructor LCDR Rick \"Jester\" Heatherly but through reckless flying breaks two [[rules of engagement]] and is reprimanded by chief instructor CDR Mike \"Viper\" Metcalf. Privately, Jester confides that he admires Maverick's skill, but wouldn't trust him as a teammate in combat. Maverick also becomes a rival to top student LT Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky, who considers Maverick's attitude \"dangerous\"\u2014as Maverick's tendency to abandon his team and pursue reckless objectives makes him \"unsafe\" to fly with. In class, Charlie also objects to Maverick's aggressive tactics but privately admits to him that she admires his flying and omitted it from her reports to hide her feelings for him, and the two begin a romantic relationship.\n\nDuring a training sortie, Maverick abandons his wingman \"Hollywood\" to chase Viper, who is impressed with his flying abilities but is defeated when Viper maneuvers Maverick into a position from which his wingman Jester can shoot down Maverick from behind, demonstrating the value of teamwork over individual prowess. Jester publicly tells Maverick that his flying is excellent, but that he should \"never leave [his] wingman.\"\n\nMaverick and Iceman, now direct competitors for the Topgun Trophy, chase an [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk|A-4]] in a later training engagement. Maverick pressures Iceman to break off his engagement so he can shoot it down, but Maverick's F-14 flies through the [[Wake turbulence|jet wash]] of Iceman's aircraft and suffers a [[flameout]] of both engines, going into an unrecoverable [[spin (flight)|flat spin]].  Maverick and Goose [[ejection seat|eject]], but Goose hits the jettisoned [[aircraft canopy]] head-first and is killed.\n\nAlthough the board of inquiry clears Maverick of responsibility for Goose's death, he is overcome by guilt and his flying skill diminishes. Charlie and others attempt to console him, but Maverick considers retiring. He seeks advice from Viper, who reveals that he served with Maverick's father Duke Mitchell on {{USS|Oriskany|CV-34|6}} and was in the air battle in which Mitchell was killed. Contrary to official reports which faulted Mitchell, Viper reveals classified information that proves Mitchell died heroically and informs Maverick that he can succeed if he can regain his self-confidence. Maverick chooses to graduate, though Iceman wins the Top Gun Trophy.\n\nDuring the graduation party, Viper calls in the newly graduated aviators with the orders to deploy. Iceman, Hollywood, and Maverick are ordered to immediately return to ''Enterprise'' to deal with a \"crisis situation\", providing air support for the rescue of a stricken ship that has drifted into hostile waters.\n\nMaverick and Merlin (Cougar's former RIO) are assigned as back-up for F-14s flown by Iceman and Hollywood, despite Iceman's reservations over Maverick's state of mind. The subsequent hostile engagement with six MiGs sees Hollywood shot down; Maverick is scrambled alone due to a [[aircraft catapult|catapult]] failure and nearly retreats after encountering circumstances similar to those that caused Goose's death. Upon finally rejoining Iceman, the two are still badly outnumbered, but Maverick vocally refuses to leave Iceman without a wingman and manages to shoot down three MiGs. Iceman, shifting to offense also shoots one down, which forces the other two to flee. Upon their triumphant return to ''Enterprise'', Iceman and Maverick share newfound respect in each other, and Maverick throws Goose's dog tags overboard.\n\nOffered any assignment he chooses, Maverick decides to return to Topgun as an instructor. At a bar in Miramar, Maverick and Charlie reunite.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- opening credits title card billing -->\n* [[Tom Cruise]] as LT Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell\n* [[Kelly McGillis]] as Charlotte \"Charlie\" Blackwood.

Numerous screenwriters allegedly turned down the project.<ref name=\"Top Gun Movie -The 80s Rewind\" /> Bruckheimer and Simpson went on to hire Jim Cash and Jack Epps, Jr., to write the first draft. The research methods, by Epps, included attendance at several declassified Topgun classes at Miramar and gaining experience by being flown in an F-14. The first draft failed to impress Bruckheimer and Simpson, and is considered to be very different from the final product in numerous ways.<ref>Special Edition DVD, Interview with Jack Epps</ref> Tony Scott was hired to direct on the strength of a commercial he had done for Swedish automaker [[Saab automobile|Saab]] in the early 1980s, where a [[Saab 900]] turbo is shown racing a [[Saab 37 Viggen]] fighter jet.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jets, jeans and Hovis|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/aug/24/1|agency=The Guardian|date=12 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nActor [[Matthew Modine]] turned down the role of [[Pete Mitchell (Top Gun)|LT Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell]] (that went to Tom Cruise) because he felt the film's pro-military stance went against his politics.

The first scene features Goose and Maverick singing \"[[Great Balls of Fire]]\" while seated at the piano. The final scene, where \"[[You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin']]\" can be heard on the restaurant's jukebox, was also filmed at the restaurant. Both scenes were filmed consecutively. After release of the movie, the restaurant went on to collect a significant amount of memorabilia from the motion picture until a kitchen fire on June 26, 2008, destroyed much of the restaurant. Some memorabilia and props, including the original piano used in the film, survived the fire, and the restaurant re-opened in November 2008.\n\nRenowned aerobatic pilot [[Art Scholl]] was hired to do in-flight camera work for the film. The original script called for a [[Spin (flight)|flat spin]], which Scholl was to perform and capture on a camera on the aircraft. The aircraft was observed to spin through its recovery altitude, at which time Scholl radioed \"I have a problem... I have a real problem\". He was unable to recover from the spin and crashed his [[Pitts Special]] bi-plane into the [[Pacific Ocean]] off the Southern California coast near [[Carlsbad, California|Carlsbad]] on September 16, 1985. Neither Scholl's body nor his aircraft was recovered, leaving the official cause of the accident unknown.<ref>Ashurst, Sam (November 4, 2008).

Jericho was a foremost site of the [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic]] period.  The area of [[Mesopotamia]] proper was not yet settled by humans.]]\nAfter a few centuries, the first settlement was abandoned. After the PPNA settlement phase, there was a settlement hiatus of several centuries, then the PPNB settlement was founded on the eroded surface of the [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]]. This second settlement, established in 6800&nbsp;BCE, perhaps represents the work of an invading people who absorbed the original inhabitants into their dominant culture. Artifacts dating from this period include ten [[plastered human skulls]], painted so as to reconstitute the individuals' features.<ref name=Ringp367/> These represent either [[teraphim]] or the first example of [[portrait]]ure in [[art history]],{{dubious|reason=see [[Tell Awad]] and discussion on Jericho's talk page|date=August 2013}} and it is thought that they were kept in people's homes while the bodies were buried.<ref name=Freedmanp689/><ref name=Janson>Janson and Janson, 2003.</ref>\n\nThe architecture consisted of rectilinear buildings made of mudbricks on stone foundations. The mudbricks were loaf-shaped with deep thumb prints to facilitate bonding. No building has been excavated in its entirety. Normally, several rooms cluster around a central courtyard. There is one big room ({{convert|6.5|x|4|m|1|abbr=on|lk=out}}{{dubious|reason=conversion via template displays unwarranted  (false) precision|date=February 2018}} and {{convert|7|x|3|m|1|abbr=on|lk=out}}){{dubious|reason=conversion via template displays unwarranted  (false) precision|date=February 2018}} with internal divisions; the rest are small, presumably used for storage. The rooms have red or pinkish [[terrazzo]]-floors made of lime. Some impressions of mats made of reeds or rushes have been preserved. The courtyards have clay floors.\n\n[[Kathleen Kenyon]] interpreted one building as a [[shrine]]. It contained a niche in the wall. A chipped pillar of volcanic stone that was found nearby might have fitted into this niche.\n\nThe dead were buried under the floors or in the rubble fill of abandoned buildings. There are several collective burials. Not all the skeletons are completely articulated, which may point to a time of exposure before burial. A [[human skull|skull]] cache contained seven skulls. The jaws were removed and the faces covered with plaster; [[cowry|cowries]] were used as eyes. A total of ten skulls were found. Modelled skulls were found in [[Tell Ramad]] and [[Beisamoun]] as well.\n\nOther finds included flints, such as arrowheads (tanged or side-notched), finely denticulated sickle-blades, [[Burin (lithic flake)|burin]]s, scrapers, a few [[tranchet axe]]s, [[obsidian]], and green obsidian from an unknown source. There were also [[Quern-stone|querns]], hammerstones, and a few ground-stone axes made of greenstone. Other items discovered included dishes and bowls carved from soft limestone, spindle whorls made of stone and possible loom weights, spatulae and drills, stylised anthropomorphic plaster figures, almost life-size, [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] and [[Therianthropy|theriomorphic]] clay figurines, as well as shell and malachite beads.\n\nIn the late 4th millennium BCE, Jericho was occupied during Neolithic 2{{dubious|Neol. 2 seems to be equivalent with PPNB, which ends long before M4 BCE.

This link is established by the presence of rectilinear mud-brick buildings and plaster floors that are characteristic of the age.\n\n===Bronze Age===\nA succession of settlements followed from 4500&nbsp;BCE onward.\n\n[[File:Red terracotta Ancient Bronze period 3500-2000 BC Tell es-Sultan, ancient Jericho, Tomb A IV, Louvre Museum AO 15611.jpg|thumb|Red terracotta jar, Ancient Bronze period 3500\u20132000 BCE, Tell es-Sultan, ancient Jericho, Tomb A IV.

It seems to have reflected the greater urbanization in the area at that time, and has been linked to the rise of the [[Maryannu]], a class of chariot-using aristocrats linked to the rise of the [[Mitanni]]te state to the north.

After the PPNA settlement phase, there was a settlement hiatus of several centuries, then the PPNB settlement was founded on the eroded surface of the [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]]. This second settlement, established in 6800&nbsp;BCE, perhaps represents the work of an invading people who absorbed the original inhabitants into their dominant culture. Artifacts dating from this period include ten [[plastered human skulls]], painted so as to reconstitute the individuals' features.<ref name=Ringp367/> These represent either [[teraphim]] or the first example of [[portrait]]ure in [[art history]],{{dubious|reason=see [[Tell Awad]] and discussion on Jericho's talk page|date=August 2013}} and it is thought that they were kept in people's homes while the bodies were buried.<ref name=Freedmanp689/><ref name=Janson>Janson and Janson, 2003.</ref>\n\nThe architecture consisted of rectilinear buildings made of mudbricks on stone foundations. The mudbricks were loaf-shaped with deep thumb prints to facilitate bonding. No building has been excavated in its entirety. Normally, several rooms cluster around a central courtyard. There is one big room ({{convert|6.5|x|4|m|1|abbr=on|lk=out}}{{dubious|reason=conversion via template displays unwarranted  (false) precision|date=February 2018}} and {{convert|7|x|3|m|1|abbr=on|lk=out}}){{dubious|reason=conversion via template displays unwarranted  (false) precision|date=February 2018}} with internal divisions; the rest are small, presumably used for storage. The rooms have red or pinkish [[terrazzo]]-floors made of lime. Some impressions of mats made of reeds or rushes have been preserved. The courtyards have clay floors.\n\n[[Kathleen Kenyon]] interpreted one building as a [[shrine]]. It contained a niche in the wall. A chipped pillar of volcanic stone that was found nearby might have fitted into this niche.\n\nThe dead were buried under the floors or in the rubble fill of abandoned buildings. There are several collective burials. Not all the skeletons are completely articulated, which may point to a time of exposure before burial. A [[human skull|skull]] cache contained seven skulls. The jaws were removed and the faces covered with plaster; [[cowry|cowries]] were used as eyes. A total of ten skulls were found. Modelled skulls were found in [[Tell Ramad]] and [[Beisamoun]] as well.\n\nOther finds included flints, such as arrowheads (tanged or side-notched), finely denticulated sickle-blades, [[Burin (lithic flake)|burin]]s, scrapers, a few [[tranchet axe]]s, [[obsidian]], and green obsidian from an unknown source. There were also [[Quern-stone|querns]], hammerstones, and a few ground-stone axes made of greenstone. Other items discovered included dishes and bowls carved from soft limestone, spindle whorls made of stone and possible loom weights, spatulae and drills, stylised anthropomorphic plaster figures, almost life-size, [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] and [[Therianthropy|theriomorphic]] clay figurines, as well as shell and malachite beads.\n\nIn the late 4th millennium BCE, Jericho was occupied during Neolithic 2{{dubious|Neol. 2 seems to be equivalent with PPNB, which ends long before M4 BCE. Unless pottery appeared at Jericho later than M4, this is a mistake AND THIS BELONGS EITHER UNDER CHALCOLITHIC OR BRONZE AGE.|date=February 2016}} and the general character of the remains on the site link it culturally with Neolithic 2 (or PPNB) sites in the West Syrian and Middle Euphrates groups. This link is established by the presence of rectilinear mud-brick buildings and plaster floors that are characteristic of the age.\n\n===Bronze Age===\nA succession of settlements followed from 4500&nbsp;BCE onward.\n\n[[File:Red terracotta Ancient Bronze period 3500-2000 BC Tell es-Sultan, ancient Jericho, Tomb A IV, Louvre Museum AO 15611.jpg|thumb|Red terracotta jar, Ancient Bronze period 3500\u20132000 BCE, Tell es-Sultan, ancient Jericho, Tomb A IV.

It seems to have reflected the greater urbanization in the area at that time, and has been linked to the rise of the [[Maryannu]], a class of chariot-using aristocrats linked to the rise of the [[Mitanni]]te state to the north.
