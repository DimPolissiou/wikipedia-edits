Geology provides the primary evidence for [[plate tectonics]], the [[evolutionary history of life]], and the Earth's [[paleoclimatology|past climates]].\n\nGeologists use a wide variety of methods to understand the Earth's structure and evolution, including [[field work]], [[Petrology|rock description]], [[Geophysical survey|geophysical techniques]], [[Geochemistry|chemical analysis]], [[physical experiment]]s, and [[Computer simulation|numerical modelling]]. In practical terms, geology is important for [[mining|mineral]] and [[petroleum geology|hydrocarbon]] exploration and exploitation, evaluating [[water resources]], understanding of [[natural hazard]]s, the remediation of [[Environmental Geology|environmental]] problems, and providing insights into past [[climate change (general concept)|climate change]]. Geology is a major [[academic discipline]], and it plays an important role in [[geotechnical engineering]].\n\n[[File:Sarychev Peak.jpg|thumb|[[Sarychev Peak]] Volcano erupts June 12, 2009, on [[Matua Island]]]]\n\n==Geologic materials==\nThe majority of geological data comes from research on solid Earth materials. These typically fall into one of two categories: rock and unlithified material.\n\n===Rock===\n[[File:Rockcycle edit.jpg|thumb|The [[rock cycle]] shows the relationship between [[igneous]], [[sedimentary]], and [[metamorphic]] [[rocks]].]]\n\n{{Main|Rock (geology)|Rock cycle}}\n\nThe majority of research in geology is associated with the study of rock, as rock provides the primary record of the majority of the geologic history of the Earth. There are three major types of rock: [[igneous]], [[sedimentary]], and [[metamorphic]]. The [[rock cycle]] \nillustrates the relationships among them (see diagram).\n\nWhen a rock [[solidifies]] or [[crystallization|crystallizes]] from melt ([[magma]] or [[lava]]), it is an igneous rock. This rock can be [[weathering|weathered]] and [[eroded]], then [[deposition (geology)|redeposited]] and [[lithification|lithified]] into a sedimentary rock. It can then be turned into a [[metamorphic rock]] by heat and pressure that change its [[mineral]] content, resulting in a [[fabric (geology)|characteristic fabric]]. All three types may melt again, and when this happens, new magma is formed, from which an igneous rock may once more solidify.\n\n[[File:Or Venezuela.jpg|thumb| [[Native metal|Native]] [[Gold#Occurrence|gold]] from [[Venezuela]]]]\n[[File:Quartz, Tibet.jpg|thumb|[[Quartz]] from [[Tibet]]]]\n\n====Tests====\nTo study all three types of rock, geologists evaluate the minerals of which they are composed. Each mineral has distinct physical properties, and there are many tests to determine each of them. The specimens can be tested for:<ref>{{cite web|title=Mineral Identification Tests|url=http://jersey.uoregon.edu/~mstrick/MinRockID/MinTests.html|website=Geoman's Mineral ID Tests|accessdate=17 April 2017}}</ref>\n* Luster: Quality of light reflected from the surface of a mineral. Examples are metallic, pearly, waxy, dull. \n* Color: Minerals are grouped by their color. Mostly diagnostic but impurities can change a mineral's color.\n* Streak: Performed by scratching the sample on a porcelain plate. The color of the streak can help name the mineral.\n* Hardness: The resistance of a mineral to scratch.\n* Breakage pattern: A mineral can either show fracture or cleavage, the former being breakage of uneven surfaces and the latter a breakage along closely spaced parallel planes.\n* Specific gravity: the weight of a specific volume of a mineral.\n* Effervescence: Involves dripping [[hydrochloric acid]] on the mineral to test for fizzing.\n* Magnetism: Involves using a magnet to test for magnetism.\n* Taste: Minerals can have a distinctive taste, such as [[Halite (mineral)|halite]] (which tastes like [[table salt]]).\n* Smell: Minerals can have a distinctive odor. For example, [[sulfur]] smells like rotten eggs.\n\n===Unlithified material===\nGeologists also study unlithified materials (referred to as ''[[Drift (geology)|drift]]''), which typically come from more recent deposits. These materials are [[superficial deposits]] that lie above the [[bedrock]].<ref>[http://des.nh.gov/organization/commissioner/gsu/gmp/categories/overview.htm \"Surficial Geologic Maps\"] in New Hampshire Geological Survey, Geologic maps. des.nh.gov</ref> This study is often known as [[Quaternary geology]], after the [[Quaternary period]] of geologic history.\n\n====[[Magma]] and [[lava]]====\n\nHowever, unlithified material does not only include [[sediments]]. Magmas and lavas are the original unlithified source of all [[igneous rocks]]. The active flow of molten rock is closely studied in [[volcanology]], and [[igneous petrology]] aims to determine the history of igneous rocks from their final crystallization to their original molten source.\n\n==Whole-Earth structure==\n\n===Plate tectonics===\n{{Main|Plate tectonics}}\n[[File:Active Margin.svg|thumb|left|Oceanic-continental convergence resulting in [[subduction]] and [[volcanic arc]]s illustrates one effect of [[plate tectonics]].]]\n[[File:Plates tect2 en.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|The major [[tectonic plates]] of the [[Earth]]]]\n\nIn the 1960s, it was discovered that the Earth's [[lithosphere]], which includes the [[Crust (geology)|crust]] and rigid uppermost portion of the [[upper mantle]], is separated into [[tectonic plate]]s that move across the [[Plasticity (physics)|plastically]] deforming, solid, upper mantle, which is called the [[asthenosphere]]. This theory is supported by several types of observations, including seafloor spreading<ref>Hess, H.H. (November 1, 1962) \"[http://repositories.cdlib.org/sio/lib/23 History Of Ocean Basins]\", pp. 599\u2013620 in ''Petrologic studies: a volume in honor of A.F. Buddington''. A.E.J. Engel, Harold L.

Thus, oceanic plates and the adjoining mantle [[Convection|convection currents]] always move in the same direction \u2013 because the oceanic lithosphere is actually the rigid upper thermal [[boundary layer]] of the convecting mantle. This coupling between rigid plates moving on the surface of the Earth and the convecting [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] is called plate tectonics.\n\n[[File:Farallon Plate.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|In this diagram based on [[seismic tomography]], subducting [[Slab (geology)|slabs]] are in blue and continental margins and a few plate boundaries are in red. The blue blob in the cutaway section is the [[Farallon Plate]], which is subducting beneath North America. The remnants of this plate on the surface of the Earth are the [[Juan de Fuca Plate]] and [[Explorer Plate]], both in the northwestern United States and southwestern Canada, and the [[Cocos Plate]] on the west coast of Mexico.]]\n\nThe development of plate tectonics has provided a physical basis for many observations of the solid Earth. Long linear regions of geologic features are explained as plate boundaries.<ref name=\"TDE plates\">{{Cite book |last=Kious |first=Jacquelyne |author2=Tilling, Robert I. |others=Kiger, Martha, Russel, Jane |title=This Dynamic Earth: The Story of Plate Tectonics |publisher=United States Geological Survey |location=Reston, VA |date=1996 |edition=Online |chapter=Understanding Plate Motions |isbn=978-0-16-048220-5 |chapter-url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/dynamic/understanding.html |accessdate=13 March 2009}}</ref> \n{{clear left}}\nFor example:\n* [[Mid-ocean ridge]]s, high regions on the seafloor where [[hydrothermal vent]]s and volcanoes exist, are seen as [[divergent boundary|divergent boundaries]], where two plates move apart.\n* Arcs of volcanoes and earthquakes are theorized as [[convergent boundary|convergent boundaries]], where one plate [[subduction|subducts]], or moves, under another.\n\n[[Transform boundary|Transform boundaries]], such as the [[San Andreas Fault]] system, resulted in widespread powerful earthquakes. Plate tectonics also has provided a mechanism for [[Alfred Wegener]]'s theory of [[continental drift]],<ref>{{Cite book |isbn=978-0-486-61708-4|year=1999 |publisher=Courier Corporation|author=Wegener, A. |title=Origin of continents and oceans}}</ref> in which the [[continents]] move across the surface of the Earth over geologic time. They also provided a driving force for crustal deformation, and a new setting for the observations of structural geology. The power of the theory of plate tectonics lies in its ability to combine all of these observations into a single theory of how the lithosphere moves over the convecting mantle.\n\n===Earth structure===\n{{Main|Structure of the Earth}}\n[[File:Jordens inre-numbers.svg|thumb|left|The [[Earth]]'s layered structure. (1) inner core; (2) outer core; (3) lower mantle; (4) upper mantle; (5) lithosphere; (6) crust (part of the lithosphere)]]\n[[File:Earthquake wave paths.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Earth layered structure. Typical wave paths from earthquakes like these gave early seismologists insights into the layered structure of the Earth]]\n\n. '''Earth structure Advances in seismology, computer modeling, and mineralogy and crystallography at high temperatures and pressures give insights into the internal composition and structure of the Earth.''' \n\nSeismologists can use the arrival times of [[seismic wave]]s in reverse to image the interior of the Earth. Early advances in this field showed the existence of a liquid [[Earth's outer core|outer core]] (where [[S-wave|shear waves]] were not able to propagate) and a dense solid [[Earth's inner core|inner core]]. These advances led to the development of a layered model of the Earth, with a [[crust (geology)|crust]] and [[lithosphere]] on top, the [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] below (separated within itself by [[seismic tomography|seismic discontinuities]] at 410 and 660 kilometers), and the outer core and inner core below that. More recently, seismologists have been able to create detailed images of wave speeds inside the earth in the same way a doctor images a body in a CT scan. These images have led to a much more detailed view of the interior of the Earth, and have replaced the simplified layered model with a much more dynamic model.\n\nMineralogists have been able to use the pressure and temperature data from the seismic and modelling studies alongside knowledge of the elemental composition of the Earth to reproduce these conditions in experimental settings and measure changes in crystal structure. These studies explain the chemical changes associated with the major seismic discontinuities in the mantle and show the crystallographic structures expected in the inner core of the Earth.\n{{clearleft}}\n\n==Geologic time==\n{{Main|History of Earth|Geologic time scale}}\n\nThe geologic time scale encompasses the history of the Earth.<ref>[http://www.stratigraphy.org/ International Commission on Stratigraphy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050920105136/http://www.stratigraphy.org/ |date=September 20, 2005 }}. stratigraphy.org</ref> It is bracketed at the earliest by the dates of the first [[Solar System]] material at 4.567 [[Gigaannum|Ga]]<ref name=\"4.567\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1073950| title = Lead Isotopic Ages of Chondrules and Calcium-Aluminum-Rich Inclusions| journal = Science| volume = 297| issue = 5587| pages = 1678\u20131683| year = 2002| last1 = Amelin | first1 = Y.|bibcode = 2002Sci...297.1678A| pmid=12215641}}</ref> (or 4.567 billion years ago) and the formation of the Earth at\n4.54 Ga<ref name=\"4.54\">{{cite journal|author=Patterson, C.|year= 1956|title=Age of Meteorites and the Earth|journal= Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta |volume=10|issue= 4|pages= 230\u2013237|bibcode = 1956GeCoA..10..230P |doi = 10.1016/0016-7037(56)90036-9 }}</ref><ref name=\"4.54 book\">{{Cite book |isbn=978-0-8047-2331-2 |author=Dalrymple, G.

In geology, when an [[igneous rocks|igneous]] intrusion cuts across a formation of [[sedimentary rock]], it can be determined that the igneous intrusion is younger than the sedimentary rock. Different types of intrusions include stocks, [[laccolith]]s, [[batholith]]s, [[Sill (geology)|sills]] and [[Dike (geology)|dikes]].\n\n'''The [[principle of cross-cutting relationships]]''' pertains to the formation of [[Fault (geology)|faults]] and the age of the sequences through which they cut. Faults are younger than the rocks they cut; accordingly, if a fault is found that penetrates some formations but not those on top of it, then the formations that were cut are older than the fault, and the ones that are not cut must be younger than the fault. Finding the key bed in these situations may help determine whether the fault is a [[normal fault]] or a [[thrust fault]].<ref name=\"steno strat\">{{cite web |url=http://rainbow.ldeo.columbia.edu/courses/v1001/steno.html |title=Steno's Principles of Stratigraphy |last=Olsen |first=Paul E. |year=2001 |work=Dinosaurs and the History of Life |publisher=Columbia University |accessdate=2009-03-14}}</ref>\n\n'''The [[principle of inclusions and components]]''' states that, with sedimentary rocks, if inclusions (or ''[[Clastic rocks|clasts]]'') are found in a formation, then the inclusions must be older than the formation that contains them. For example, in sedimentary rocks, it is common for gravel from an older formation to be ripped up and included in a newer layer. A similar situation with igneous rocks occurs when [[xenolith]]s are found. These foreign bodies are picked up as [[magma]] or lava flows, and are incorporated, later to cool in the matrix. As a result, xenoliths are older than the rock that contains them.\n\n[[File:SEUtahStrat.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Permian]] through [[Jurassic]] stratigraphy of the [[Colorado Plateau]] area of southeastern [[Utah]] is an example of both original horizontality and the law of superposition.

Picture from [[Glen Canyon National Recreation Area]], Utah.]]\n'''The [[principle of original horizontality]]''' states that the deposition of sediments occurs as essentially horizontal beds. Observation of modern marine and non-marine sediments in a wide variety of environments supports this generalization (although [[cross-bedding]] is inclined, the overall orientation of cross-bedded units is horizontal).<ref name=\"steno strat\" />\n\n'''The [[Law of superposition|principle of superposition]]''' states that a sedimentary rock layer in a [[tectonics|tectonically]] undisturbed sequence is younger than the one beneath it and older than the one above it. Logically a younger layer cannot slip beneath a layer previously deposited. This principle allows sedimentary layers to be viewed as a form of vertical time line, a partial or complete record of the time elapsed from deposition of the lowest layer to deposition of the highest bed.<ref name=\"steno strat\" />\n\n'''The [[principle of faunal succession]]''' is based on the appearance of fossils in sedimentary rocks. As organisms exist during the same period throughout the world, their presence or (sometimes) absence provides a relative age of the formations where they appear. Based on principles that William Smith laid out almost a hundred years before the publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]], the principles of succession developed independently of evolutionary thought. The principle becomes quite complex, however, given the uncertainties of fossilization, localization of fossil types due to lateral changes in habitat ([[facies]] change in sedimentary strata), and that not all fossils formed globally at the same time.<ref>As recounted in [[Simon Winchester]], ''[[The Map that Changed the World]]'' (New York: HarperCollins, 2001) pp. 59\u201391.</ref>\n\n===Absolute dating===\n{{Main|Absolute dating|radiometric dating|geochronology}}\n[[File:Zircon-tuc1001b.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[mineral]] [[zircon]] is often used in [[radiometric dating]].]]\n\nGeologists also use methods to determine the absolute age of rock samples and geological events.

This changed the understanding of geologic time. Previously, geologists could only use fossils and stratigraphic correlation to date sections of rock relative to one another. With isotopic dates, it became possible to assign [[Absolute dating|absolute ages]] to rock units, and these absolute dates could be applied to fossil sequences in which there was datable material, converting the old relative ages into new absolute ages.\n\nFor many geologic applications, [[isotope ratio]]s of radioactive elements are measured in minerals that give the amount of time that has passed since a rock passed through its particular [[closure temperature]], the point at which different radiometric isotopes stop diffusing into and out of the [[Crystal structure|crystal lattice]].<ref>{{Cite book |isbn=978-0-582-06701-1 |author=Rollinson, Hugh R.  |year=1996 |publisher=Longman |location=Harlow |title=Using geochemical data evaluation, presentation, interpretation}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |isbn=978-0-02-336450-1 |author=Faure, Gunter |year=1998 |publisher=Prentice-Hall |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |title=Principles and applications of geochemistry: a comprehensive textbook for geology students}}</ref> These are used in [[geochronology|geochronologic]] and [[thermochronology|thermochronologic]] studies. Common methods include [[uranium-lead dating]], [[potassium-argon dating]], [[argon-argon dating]] and [[uranium-thorium dating]]. These methods are used for a variety of applications. Dating of [[lava]] and [[volcanic ash]] layers found within a stratigraphic sequence can provide absolute age data for sedimentary rock units that do not contain radioactive isotopes and calibrate relative dating techniques. These methods can also be used to determine ages of [[pluton]] emplacement.\nThermochemical techniques can be used to determine temperature profiles within the crust, the uplift of mountain ranges, and paleotopography.\n\nFractionation of the [[lanthanide series]] elements is used to compute ages since rocks were removed from the mantle.\n\nOther methods are used for more recent events. [[Optically stimulated luminescence]] and [[Cosmogenic isotope#Natural|cosmogenic radionuclide]] dating are used to date surfaces and/or erosion rates. [[Dendrochronology]] can also be used for the dating of landscapes.

Deep below the surface are a [[magma chamber]] and large associated igneous bodies. The magma chamber feeds the [[volcano]], and sends offshoots of [[magma]] that will later crystallize into dikes and sills. Magma also advances upwards to form [[intrusive rock|intrusive igneous bodies]]. The diagram illustrates both a [[cinder cone]] volcano, which releases ash, and a [[composite volcano]], which releases both lava and ash.]]\n[[File:Fault types.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.9| An illustration of the three types of faults.<br>\nA. Strike-slip faults occur when rock units slide past one another.<br>\nB. Normal faults occur when rocks are undergoing horizontal extension.<br>\nC. Reverse (or thrust) faults occur when rocks are undergoing horizontal shortening.]]\n\n[[File:San Andreas.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[San Andreas Fault]] in [[California]]]]\n\nThe geology of an area changes through time as rock units are deposited and inserted, and deformational processes change their shapes and locations.\n\nRock units are first emplaced either by deposition onto the surface or intrusion into the [[Country rock (geology)|overlying rock]]. Deposition can occur when sediments settle onto the surface of the Earth and later [[lithification|lithify]] into sedimentary rock, or when as [[volcanic rock|volcanic material]] such as [[volcanic ash]] or [[lava flow]]s blanket the surface. [[Igneous intrusion]]s such as [[batholith]]s, [[laccolith]]s, [[dike (geology)|dikes]], and [[sill (geology)|sills]], push upwards into the overlying rock, and crystallize as they intrude.\n\nAfter the initial sequence of rocks has been deposited, the rock units can be [[deformation (mechanics)|deformed]] and/or [[metamorphism|metamorphosed]]. Deformation typically occurs as a result of horizontal shortening, [[extension (geology)|horizontal extension]], or side-to-side ([[strike-slip]]) motion. These structural regimes broadly relate to [[convergent boundary|convergent boundaries]], [[divergent boundary|divergent boundaries]], and transform boundaries, respectively, between tectonic plates.\n\nWhen rock units are placed under horizontal [[compression (geology)|compression]], they shorten and become thicker. Because rock units, other than muds, [[Incompressible surface|do not significantly change in volume]], this is accomplished in two primary ways: through [[fault (geology)|faulting]] and [[fold (geology)|folding]]. In the shallow crust, where [[brittle deformation]] can occur, thrust faults form, which causes deeper rock to move on top of shallower rock. Because deeper rock is often older, as noted by the [[law of superposition|principle of superposition]], this can result in older rocks moving on top of younger ones. Movement along faults can result in folding, either because the faults are not planar or because rock layers are dragged along, forming drag folds as slip occurs along the fault. Deeper in the Earth, rocks behave plastically and fold instead of faulting. These folds can either be those where the material in the center of the fold buckles upwards, creating \"[[antiform]]s\", or where it buckles downwards, creating \"[[synform]]s\". If the tops of the rock units within the folds remain pointing upwards, they are called [[anticline]]s and [[syncline]]s, respectively. If some of the units in the fold are facing downward, the structure is called an overturned anticline or syncline, and if all of the rock units are overturned or the correct up-direction is unknown, they are simply called by the most general terms, antiforms and synforms.\n\n[[File:Antecline (PSF).png|thumb|A diagram of folds, indicating an [[anticline]] and a [[syncline]]]]\nEven higher pressures and temperatures during horizontal shortening can cause both folding and [[metamorphism]] of the rocks. This metamorphism causes changes in the [[mineral|mineral composition]] of the rocks; creates a [[foliation (geology)|foliation]], or planar surface, that is related to mineral growth under stress.  This can remove signs of the original textures of the rocks, such as [[bed (geology)|bedding]] in sedimentary rocks, flow features of [[lava]]s, and crystal patterns in [[crystalline rock]]s.\n\nExtension causes the rock units as a whole to become longer and thinner. This is primarily accomplished through [[normal fault]]ing and through the ductile stretching and thinning. Normal faults drop rock units that are higher below those that are lower. This typically results in younger units ending up below older units. Stretching of units can result in their thinning. In fact, at one location within the [[Maria Fold and Thrust Belt]], the entire sedimentary sequence of the [[Grand Canyon]] appears over a length of less than a meter. Rocks at the depth to be ductilely stretched are often also metamorphosed. These stretched rocks can also pinch into lenses, known as ''[[boudinage|boudins]]'', after the French word for \"sausage\" because of their visual similarity.\n\nWhere rock units slide past one another, [[strike-slip fault]]s develop in shallow regions, and become [[shear zone]]s at deeper depths where the rocks deform ductilely.\n\n[[File:Kittatinny Mountain Cross Section.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Geologic [[cross section (geology)|cross section]] of [[Kittatinny Mountain]]. This cross section shows metamorphic rocks, overlain by younger sediments deposited after the metamorphic event. These rock units were later folded and faulted during the uplift of the mountain.]]\nThe addition of new rock units, both depositionally and intrusively, often occurs during deformation. Faulting and other deformational processes result in the creation of topographic gradients, causing material on the rock unit that is increasing in elevation to be eroded by hillslopes and channels. These sediments are deposited on the rock unit that is going down. Continual motion along the fault maintains the topographic gradient in spite of the movement of sediment, and continues to create [[accommodation space]] for the material to deposit. Deformational events are often also associated with volcanism and igneous activity. Volcanic ashes and lavas accumulate on the surface, and igneous intrusions enter from below. [[Dike (geology)|Dikes]], long, planar igneous intrusions, enter along cracks, and therefore often form in large numbers in areas that are being actively deformed. This can result in the emplacement of [[dike swarm]]s, such as those that are observable across the Canadian shield, or rings of dikes around the [[lava tube]] of a volcano.\n\nAll of these processes do not necessarily occur in a single environment, and do not necessarily occur in a single order. The [[Hawaiian Islands]], for example, consist almost entirely of layered [[basalt]]ic lava flows. The sedimentary sequences of the mid-continental United States and the [[Geology of the Grand Canyon area|Grand Canyon]] in the southwestern United States contain almost-undeformed stacks of sedimentary rocks that have remained in place since [[Cambrian]] time. Other areas are much more geologically complex. In the southwestern United States, sedimentary, volcanic, and intrusive rocks have been metamorphosed, faulted, foliated, and folded. Even older rocks, such as the [[Acasta gneiss]] of the [[Slave craton]] in northwestern [[Canada]], the [[Oldest rock|oldest known rock in the world]] have been metamorphosed to the point where their origin is undiscernable without laboratory analysis. In addition, these processes can occur in stages. In many places, the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States being a very visible example, the lower rock units were metamorphosed and deformed, and then deformation ended and the upper, undeformed units were deposited. Although any amount of rock emplacement and rock deformation can occur, and they can occur any number of times, these concepts provide a guide to understanding the [[Historical geology|geological history]] of an area.\n\n==Methods of geology==\n[[File:Brunton.JPG|thumb|A standard [[:en:Brunton compass|Brunton Pocket Transit]], commonly used by geologists for mapping and surveying]]\n\nGeologists use a number of field, laboratory, and numerical modeling methods to decipher Earth history and to understand the processes that occur on and inside the Earth. In typical geological investigations, geologists use primary information related to [[petrology]] (the study of rocks), stratigraphy (the study of sedimentary layers), and structural geology (the study of positions of rock units and their deformation). In many cases, geologists also study modern soils, [[river]]s, [[landscape]]s, and [[glacier]]s; investigate past and current life and [[biogeochemistry|biogeochemical]] pathways, and use [[geophysics|geophysical methods]] to investigate the subsurface.

This new field of study is called [[planetary geology]] (sometimes known as astrogeology) and relies on known geologic principles to study other bodies of the solar system.\n\nAlthough the Greek-language-origin prefix ''[[wikt:geo-|geo]]'' refers to Earth, \"geology\" is often used in conjunction with the names of other planetary bodies when describing their composition and internal processes: examples are \"the [[geology of Mars]]\" and \"[[Lunar geology]]\". Specialised terms such as ''selenology'' (studies of the Moon), ''areology'' (of Mars), etc., are also in use.\n\nAlthough planetary geologists are interested in studying all aspects of other planets, a significant focus is to search for evidence of past or present life on other worlds. This has led to many missions whose primary or ancillary purpose is to examine planetary bodies for evidence of life. One of these is the [[Phoenix lander]], which analyzed [[Mars|Martian]] polar soil for water, chemical, and mineralogical constituents related to biological processes.\n\n==Applied geology==\n[[File:Panning on the Mokelumne.jpg|thumb|upright|Man panning for [[gold]] on the [[Mokelumne]].

In his paper, he explained his theory that the Earth must be much older than had previously been supposed to allow enough time for mountains to be eroded and for [[sediment]]s to form new rocks at the bottom of the sea, which in turn were raised up to become dry land. Hutton published a two-volume version of his ideas in 1795 ([http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/12861 Vol. 1], [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14179 Vol. 2]).\n\nFollowers of Hutton were known as ''[[Plutonism|Plutonists]]'' because they believed that some rocks were formed by ''vulcanism'', which is the deposition of lava from volcanoes, as opposed to the ''[[Neptunism|Neptunists]]'', led by [[Abraham Gottlob Werner|Abraham Werner]], who believed that all rocks had settled out of a large ocean whose level gradually dropped over time.\n\nThe first [[Geologic map of Georgia|geological map of the U.S.]] was produced in 1809 by [[William Maclure]].<ref name=\"Maclure1817\">{{cite book|author=Maclure, William |title=Observations on the Geology of the United States of America: With Some Remarks on the Effect Produced on the Nature and Fertility of Soils, by the Decomposition of the Different Classes of Rocks; and an Application to the Fertility of Every State in the Union, in Reference to the Accompanying Geological Map.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_bgQAAAAIAAJ|year=1817|publisher=Abraham Small|location= Philadelphia}}</ref> In 1807, Maclure commenced the self-imposed task of making a geological survey of the United States.

This book, which influenced the thought of [[Charles Darwin]], successfully promoted the doctrine of [[uniformitarianism]]. This theory states that slow geological processes have occurred throughout the [[History of Earth|Earth's history]] and are still occurring today. In contrast, [[catastrophism]] is the theory that Earth's features formed in single, catastrophic events and remained unchanged thereafter. Though Hutton believed in uniformitarianism, the idea was not widely accepted at the time.\n\nMuch of 19th-century geology revolved around the question of the [[Age of the Earth|Earth's exact age]].

These typically fall into one of two categories: rock and unlithified material.\n\n===Rock===\n[[File:Rockcycle edit.jpg|thumb|The [[rock cycle]] shows the relationship between [[igneous]], [[sedimentary]], and [[metamorphic]] [[rocks]].]]\n\n{{Main|Rock (geology)|Rock cycle}}\n\nThe majority of research in geology is associated with the study of rock, as rock provides the primary record of the majority of the geologic history of the Earth. There are three major types of rock: [[igneous]], [[sedimentary]], and [[metamorphic]]. The [[rock cycle]] \nillustrates the relationships among them (see diagram).\n\nWhen a rock [[solidifies]] or [[crystallization|crystallizes]] from melt ([[magma]] or [[lava]]), it is an igneous rock. This rock can be [[weathering|weathered]] and [[eroded]], then [[deposition (geology)|redeposited]] and [[lithification|lithified]] into a sedimentary rock. It can then be turned into a [[metamorphic rock]] by heat and pressure that change its [[mineral]] content, resulting in a [[fabric (geology)|characteristic fabric]]. All three types may melt again, and when this happens, new magma is formed, from which an igneous rock may once more solidify.\n\n[[File:Or Venezuela.jpg|thumb| [[Native metal|Native]] [[Gold#Occurrence|gold]] from [[Venezuela]]]]\n[[File:Quartz, Tibet.jpg|thumb|[[Quartz]] from [[Tibet]]]]\n\n====Tests====\nTo study all three types of rock, geologists evaluate the minerals of which they are composed. Each mineral has distinct physical properties, and there are many tests to determine each of them. The specimens can be tested for:<ref>{{cite web|title=Mineral Identification Tests|url=http://jersey.uoregon.edu/~mstrick/MinRockID/MinTests.html|website=Geoman's Mineral ID Tests|accessdate=17 April 2017}}</ref>\n* Luster: Quality of light reflected from the surface of a mineral. Examples are metallic, pearly, waxy, dull. \n* Color: Minerals are grouped by their color. Mostly diagnostic but impurities can change a mineral's color.\n* Streak: Performed by scratching the sample on a porcelain plate. The color of the streak can help name the mineral.\n* Hardness: The resistance of a mineral to scratch.\n* Breakage pattern: A mineral can either show fracture or cleavage, the former being breakage of uneven surfaces and the latter a breakage along closely spaced parallel planes.\n* Specific gravity: the weight of a specific volume of a mineral.\n* Effervescence: Involves dripping [[hydrochloric acid]] on the mineral to test for fizzing.\n* Magnetism: Involves using a magnet to test for magnetism.\n* Taste: Minerals can have a distinctive taste, such as [[Halite (mineral)|halite]] (which tastes like [[table salt]]).\n* Smell: Minerals can have a distinctive odor. For example, [[sulfur]] smells like rotten eggs.\n\n===Unlithified material===\nGeologists also study unlithified materials (referred to as ''[[Drift (geology)|drift]]''), which typically come from more recent deposits. These materials are [[superficial deposits]] that lie above the [[bedrock]].<ref>[http://des.nh.gov/organization/commissioner/gsu/gmp/categories/overview.htm \"Surficial Geologic Maps\"] in New Hampshire Geological Survey, Geologic maps. des.nh.gov</ref> This study is often known as [[Quaternary geology]], after the [[Quaternary period]] of geologic history.\n\n====[[Magma]] and [[lava]]====\n\nHowever, unlithified material does not only include [[sediments]]. Magmas and lavas are the original unlithified source of all [[igneous rocks]]. The active flow of molten rock is closely studied in [[volcanology]], and [[igneous petrology]] aims to determine the history of igneous rocks from their final crystallization to their original molten source.\n\n==Whole-Earth structure==\n\n===Plate tectonics===\n{{Main|Plate tectonics}}\n[[File:Active Margin.svg|thumb|left|Oceanic-continental convergence resulting in [[subduction]] and [[volcanic arc]]s illustrates one effect of [[plate tectonics]].]]\n[[File:Plates tect2 en.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|The major [[tectonic plates]] of the [[Earth]]]]\n\nIn the 1960s, it was discovered that the Earth's [[lithosphere]], which includes the [[Crust (geology)|crust]] and rigid uppermost portion of the [[upper mantle]], is separated into [[tectonic plate]]s that move across the [[Plasticity (physics)|plastically]] deforming, solid, upper mantle, which is called the [[asthenosphere]].

Thus, oceanic plates and the adjoining mantle [[Convection|convection currents]] always move in the same direction \u2013 because the oceanic lithosphere is actually the rigid upper thermal [[boundary layer]] of the convecting mantle. This coupling between rigid plates moving on the surface of the Earth and the convecting [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] is called plate tectonics.\n\n[[File:Farallon Plate.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|In this diagram based on [[seismic tomography]], subducting [[Slab (geology)|slabs]] are in blue and continental margins and a few plate boundaries are in red.

They also provided a driving force for crustal deformation, and a new setting for the observations of structural geology. The power of the theory of plate tectonics lies in its ability to combine all of these observations into a single theory of how the lithosphere moves over the convecting mantle.\n\n===Earth structure===\n{{Main|Structure of the Earth}}\n[[File:Jordens inre-numbers.svg|thumb|left|The [[Earth]]'s layered structure.

Typical wave paths from earthquakes like these gave early seismologists insights into the layered structure of the Earth]]\n\nAdvances in [[seismology]], [[computer modeling]], and [[mineralogy]] and [[crystallography]] at high temperatures and pressures give insights into the internal composition and structure of the Earth.\n\nSeismologists can use the arrival times of [[seismic wave]]s in reverse to image the interior of the Earth. Early advances in this field showed the existence of a liquid [[Earth's outer core|outer core]] (where [[S-wave|shear waves]] were not able to propagate) and a dense solid [[Earth's inner core|inner core]]. These advances led to the development of a layered model of the Earth, with a [[crust (geology)|crust]] and [[lithosphere]] on top, the [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] below (separated within itself by [[seismic tomography|seismic discontinuities]] at 410 and 660 kilometers), and the outer core and inner core below that. More recently, seismologists have been able to create detailed images of wave speeds inside the earth in the same way a doctor images a body in a CT scan. These images have led to a much more detailed view of the interior of the Earth, and have replaced the simplified layered model with a much more dynamic model.\n\nMineralogists have been able to use the pressure and temperature data from the seismic and modelling studies alongside knowledge of the elemental composition of the Earth to reproduce these conditions in experimental settings and measure changes in crystal structure. These studies explain the chemical changes associated with the major seismic discontinuities in the mantle and show the crystallographic structures expected in the inner core of the Earth.\n{{clearleft}}\n\n==Geologic time==\n{{Main|History of Earth|Geologic time scale}}\n\nThe geologic time scale encompasses the history of the Earth.<ref>[http://www.stratigraphy.org/ International Commission on Stratigraphy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050920105136/http://www.stratigraphy.org/ |date=September 20, 2005 }}. stratigraphy.org</ref> It is bracketed at the earliest by the dates of the first [[Solar System]] material at 4.567 [[Gigaannum|Ga]]<ref name=\"4.567\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1073950| title = Lead Isotopic Ages of Chondrules and Calcium-Aluminum-Rich Inclusions| journal = Science| volume = 297| issue = 5587| pages = 1678\u20131683| year = 2002| last1 = Amelin | first1 = Y.|bibcode = 2002Sci...297.1678A| pmid=12215641}}</ref> (or 4.567 billion years ago) and the formation of the Earth at\n4.54 Ga<ref name=\"4.54\">{{cite journal|author=Patterson, C.|year= 1956|title=Age of Meteorites and the Earth|journal= Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta |volume=10|issue= 4|pages= 230\u2013237|bibcode = 1956GeCoA..10..230P |doi = 10.1016/0016-7037(56)90036-9 }}</ref><ref name=\"4.54 book\">{{Cite book |isbn=978-0-8047-2331-2 |author=Dalrymple, G.

In geology, when an [[igneous rocks|igneous]] intrusion cuts across a formation of [[sedimentary rock]], it can be determined that the igneous intrusion is younger than the sedimentary rock. Different types of intrusions include stocks, [[laccolith]]s, [[batholith]]s, [[Sill (geology)|sills]] and [[Dike (geology)|dikes]].\n\n'''The [[principle of cross-cutting relationships]]''' pertains to the formation of [[Fault (geology)|faults]] and the age of the sequences through which they cut. Faults are younger than the rocks they cut; accordingly, if a fault is found that penetrates some formations but not those on top of it, then the formations that were cut are older than the fault, and the ones that are not cut must be younger than the fault. Finding the key bed in these situations may help determine whether the fault is a [[normal fault]] or a [[thrust fault]].<ref name=\"steno strat\">{{cite web |url=http://rainbow.ldeo.columbia.edu/courses/v1001/steno.html |title=Steno's Principles of Stratigraphy |last=Olsen |first=Paul E. |year=2001 |work=Dinosaurs and the History of Life |publisher=Columbia University |accessdate=2009-03-14}}</ref>\n\n'''The [[principle of inclusions and components]]''' states that, with sedimentary rocks, if inclusions (or ''[[Clastic rocks|clasts]]'') are found in a formation, then the inclusions must be older than the formation that contains them. For example, in sedimentary rocks, it is common for gravel from an older formation to be ripped up and included in a newer layer. A similar situation with igneous rocks occurs when [[xenolith]]s are found. These foreign bodies are picked up as [[magma]] or lava flows, and are incorporated, later to cool in the matrix. As a result, xenoliths are older than the rock that contains them.\n\n[[File:SEUtahStrat.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Permian]] through [[Jurassic]] stratigraphy of the [[Colorado Plateau]] area of southeastern [[Utah]] is an example of both original horizontality and the law of superposition.

Picture from [[Glen Canyon National Recreation Area]], Utah.]]\n'''The [[principle of original horizontality]]''' states that the deposition of sediments occurs as essentially horizontal beds. Observation of modern marine and non-marine sediments in a wide variety of environments supports this generalization (although [[cross-bedding]] is inclined, the overall orientation of cross-bedded units is horizontal).<ref name=\"steno strat\" />\n\n'''The [[Law of superposition|principle of superposition]]''' states that a sedimentary rock layer in a [[tectonics|tectonically]] undisturbed sequence is younger than the one beneath it and older than the one above it. Logically a younger layer cannot slip beneath a layer previously deposited. This principle allows sedimentary layers to be viewed as a form of vertical time line, a partial or complete record of the time elapsed from deposition of the lowest layer to deposition of the highest bed.<ref name=\"steno strat\" />\n\n'''The [[principle of faunal succession]]''' is based on the appearance of fossils in sedimentary rocks. As organisms exist during the same period throughout the world, their presence or (sometimes) absence provides a relative age of the formations where they appear. Based on principles that William Smith laid out almost a hundred years before the publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]], the principles of succession developed independently of evolutionary thought. The principle becomes quite complex, however, given the uncertainties of fossilization, localization of fossil types due to lateral changes in habitat ([[facies]] change in sedimentary strata), and that not all fossils formed globally at the same time.<ref>As recounted in [[Simon Winchester]], ''[[The Map that Changed the World]]'' (New York: HarperCollins, 2001) pp. 59\u201391.</ref>\n\n===Absolute dating===\n{{Main|Absolute dating|radiometric dating|geochronology}}\n[[File:Zircon-tuc1001b.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[mineral]] [[zircon]] is often used in [[radiometric dating]].]]\n\nGeologists also use methods to determine the absolute age of rock samples and geological events.

This changed the understanding of geologic time. Previously, geologists could only use fossils and stratigraphic correlation to date sections of rock relative to one another. With isotopic dates, it became possible to assign [[Absolute dating|absolute ages]] to rock units, and these absolute dates could be applied to fossil sequences in which there was datable material, converting the old relative ages into new absolute ages.\n\nFor many geologic applications, [[isotope ratio]]s of radioactive elements are measured in minerals that give the amount of time that has passed since a rock passed through its particular [[closure temperature]], the point at which different radiometric isotopes stop diffusing into and out of the [[Crystal structure|crystal lattice]].<ref>{{Cite book |isbn=978-0-582-06701-1 |author=Rollinson, Hugh R.  |year=1996 |publisher=Longman |location=Harlow |title=Using geochemical data evaluation, presentation, interpretation}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |isbn=978-0-02-336450-1 |author=Faure, Gunter |year=1998 |publisher=Prentice-Hall |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |title=Principles and applications of geochemistry: a comprehensive textbook for geology students}}</ref> These are used in [[geochronology|geochronologic]] and [[thermochronology|thermochronologic]] studies. Common methods include [[uranium-lead dating]], [[potassium-argon dating]], [[argon-argon dating]] and [[uranium-thorium dating]]. These methods are used for a variety of applications. Dating of [[lava]] and [[volcanic ash]] layers found within a stratigraphic sequence can provide absolute age data for sedimentary rock units that do not contain radioactive isotopes and calibrate relative dating techniques. These methods can also be used to determine ages of [[pluton]] emplacement.\nThermochemical techniques can be used to determine temperature profiles within the crust, the uplift of mountain ranges, and paleotopography.\n\nFractionation of the [[lanthanide series]] elements is used to compute ages since rocks were removed from the mantle.\n\nOther methods are used for more recent events. [[Optically stimulated luminescence]] and [[Cosmogenic isotope#Natural|cosmogenic radionuclide]] dating are used to date surfaces and/or erosion rates. [[Dendrochronology]] can also be used for the dating of landscapes.

Deep below the surface are a [[magma chamber]] and large associated igneous bodies. The magma chamber feeds the [[volcano]], and sends offshoots of [[magma]] that will later crystallize into dikes and sills. Magma also advances upwards to form [[intrusive rock|intrusive igneous bodies]]. The diagram illustrates both a [[cinder cone]] volcano, which releases ash, and a [[composite volcano]], which releases both lava and ash.]]\n[[File:Fault types.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.9| An illustration of the three types of faults.<br>\nA. Strike-slip faults occur when rock units slide past one another.<br>\nB. Normal faults occur when rocks are undergoing horizontal extension.<br>\nC. Reverse (or thrust) faults occur when rocks are undergoing horizontal shortening.]]\n\n[[File:San Andreas.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[San Andreas Fault]] in [[California]]]]\n\nThe geology of an area changes through time as rock units are deposited and inserted, and deformational processes change their shapes and locations.\n\nRock units are first emplaced either by deposition onto the surface or intrusion into the [[Country rock (geology)|overlying rock]]. Deposition can occur when sediments settle onto the surface of the Earth and later [[lithification|lithify]] into sedimentary rock, or when as [[volcanic rock|volcanic material]] such as [[volcanic ash]] or [[lava flow]]s blanket the surface. [[Igneous intrusion]]s such as [[batholith]]s, [[laccolith]]s, [[dike (geology)|dikes]], and [[sill (geology)|sills]], push upwards into the overlying rock, and crystallize as they intrude.\n\nAfter the initial sequence of rocks has been deposited, the rock units can be [[deformation (mechanics)|deformed]] and/or [[metamorphism|metamorphosed]]. Deformation typically occurs as a result of horizontal shortening, [[extension (geology)|horizontal extension]], or side-to-side ([[strike-slip]]) motion. These structural regimes broadly relate to [[convergent boundary|convergent boundaries]], [[divergent boundary|divergent boundaries]], and transform boundaries, respectively, between tectonic plates.\n\nWhen rock units are placed under horizontal [[compression (geology)|compression]], they shorten and become thicker. Because rock units, other than muds, [[Incompressible surface|do not significantly change in volume]], this is accomplished in two primary ways: through [[fault (geology)|faulting]] and [[fold (geology)|folding]]. In the shallow crust, where [[brittle deformation]] can occur, thrust faults form, which causes deeper rock to move on top of shallower rock. Because deeper rock is often older, as noted by the [[law of superposition|principle of superposition]], this can result in older rocks moving on top of younger ones. Movement along faults can result in folding, either because the faults are not planar or because rock layers are dragged along, forming drag folds as slip occurs along the fault. Deeper in the Earth, rocks behave plastically and fold instead of faulting. These folds can either be those where the material in the center of the fold buckles upwards, creating \"[[antiform]]s\", or where it buckles downwards, creating \"[[synform]]s\". If the tops of the rock units within the folds remain pointing upwards, they are called [[anticline]]s and [[syncline]]s, respectively. If some of the units in the fold are facing downward, the structure is called an overturned anticline or syncline, and if all of the rock units are overturned or the correct up-direction is unknown, they are simply called by the most general terms, antiforms and synforms.\n\n[[File:Antecline (PSF).png|thumb|A diagram of folds, indicating an [[anticline]] and a [[syncline]]]]\nEven higher pressures and temperatures during horizontal shortening can cause both folding and [[metamorphism]] of the rocks. This metamorphism causes changes in the [[mineral|mineral composition]] of the rocks; creates a [[foliation (geology)|foliation]], or planar surface, that is related to mineral growth under stress.  This can remove signs of the original textures of the rocks, such as [[bed (geology)|bedding]] in sedimentary rocks, flow features of [[lava]]s, and crystal patterns in [[crystalline rock]]s.\n\nExtension causes the rock units as a whole to become longer and thinner. This is primarily accomplished through [[normal fault]]ing and through the ductile stretching and thinning. Normal faults drop rock units that are higher below those that are lower. This typically results in younger units ending up below older units. Stretching of units can result in their thinning. In fact, at one location within the [[Maria Fold and Thrust Belt]], the entire sedimentary sequence of the [[Grand Canyon]] appears over a length of less than a meter. Rocks at the depth to be ductilely stretched are often also metamorphosed. These stretched rocks can also pinch into lenses, known as ''[[boudinage|boudins]]'', after the French word for \"sausage\" because of their visual similarity.\n\nWhere rock units slide past one another, [[strike-slip fault]]s develop in shallow regions, and become [[shear zone]]s at deeper depths where the rocks deform ductilely.\n\n[[File:Kittatinny Mountain Cross Section.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Geologic [[cross section (geology)|cross section]] of [[Kittatinny Mountain]]. This cross section shows metamorphic rocks, overlain by younger sediments deposited after the metamorphic event. These rock units were later folded and faulted during the uplift of the mountain.]]\nThe addition of new rock units, both depositionally and intrusively, often occurs during deformation. Faulting and other deformational processes result in the creation of topographic gradients, causing material on the rock unit that is increasing in elevation to be eroded by hillslopes and channels. These sediments are deposited on the rock unit that is going down. Continual motion along the fault maintains the topographic gradient in spite of the movement of sediment, and continues to create [[accommodation space]] for the material to deposit. Deformational events are often also associated with volcanism and igneous activity. Volcanic ashes and lavas accumulate on the surface, and igneous intrusions enter from below. [[Dike (geology)|Dikes]], long, planar igneous intrusions, enter along cracks, and therefore often form in large numbers in areas that are being actively deformed. This can result in the emplacement of [[dike swarm]]s, such as those that are observable across the Canadian shield, or rings of dikes around the [[lava tube]] of a volcano.\n\nAll of these processes do not necessarily occur in a single environment, and do not necessarily occur in a single order. The [[Hawaiian Islands]], for example, consist almost entirely of layered [[basalt]]ic lava flows. The sedimentary sequences of the mid-continental United States and the [[Geology of the Grand Canyon area|Grand Canyon]] in the southwestern United States contain almost-undeformed stacks of sedimentary rocks that have remained in place since [[Cambrian]] time. Other areas are much more geologically complex. In the southwestern United States, sedimentary, volcanic, and intrusive rocks have been metamorphosed, faulted, foliated, and folded. Even older rocks, such as the [[Acasta gneiss]] of the [[Slave craton]] in northwestern [[Canada]], the [[Oldest rock|oldest known rock in the world]] have been metamorphosed to the point where their origin is undiscernable without laboratory analysis. In addition, these processes can occur in stages. In many places, the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States being a very visible example, the lower rock units were metamorphosed and deformed, and then deformation ended and the upper, undeformed units were deposited. Although any amount of rock emplacement and rock deformation can occur, and they can occur any number of times, these concepts provide a guide to understanding the [[Historical geology|geological history]] of an area.\n\n==Methods of geology==\n[[File:Brunton.JPG|thumb|A standard [[:en:Brunton compass|Brunton Pocket Transit]], commonly used by geologists for mapping and surveying]]\n\nGeologists use a number of field, laboratory, and numerical modeling methods to decipher Earth history and to understand the processes that occur on and inside the Earth. In typical geological investigations, geologists use primary information related to [[petrology]] (the study of rocks), stratigraphy (the study of sedimentary layers), and structural geology (the study of positions of rock units and their deformation). In many cases, geologists also study modern soils, [[river]]s, [[landscape]]s, and [[glacier]]s; investigate past and current life and [[biogeochemistry|biogeochemical]] pathways, and use [[geophysics|geophysical methods]] to investigate the subsurface.

This new field of study is called [[planetary geology]] (sometimes known as astrogeology) and relies on known geologic principles to study other bodies of the solar system.\n\nAlthough the Greek-language-origin prefix ''[[wikt:geo-|geo]]'' refers to Earth, \"geology\" is often used in conjunction with the names of other planetary bodies when describing their composition and internal processes: examples are \"the [[geology of Mars]]\" and \"[[Lunar geology]]\". Specialised terms such as ''selenology'' (studies of the Moon), ''areology'' (of Mars), etc., are also in use.\n\nAlthough planetary geologists are interested in studying all aspects of other planets, a significant focus is to search for evidence of past or present life on other worlds. This has led to many missions whose primary or ancillary purpose is to examine planetary bodies for evidence of life. One of these is the [[Phoenix lander]], which analyzed [[Mars|Martian]] polar soil for water, chemical, and mineralogical constituents related to biological processes.\n\n==Applied geology==\n[[File:Panning on the Mokelumne.jpg|thumb|upright|Man panning for [[gold]] on the [[Mokelumne]].

In his paper, he explained his theory that the Earth must be much older than had previously been supposed to allow enough time for mountains to be eroded and for [[sediment]]s to form new rocks at the bottom of the sea, which in turn were raised up to become dry land. Hutton published a two-volume version of his ideas in 1795 ([http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/12861 Vol. 1], [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14179 Vol. 2]).\n\nFollowers of Hutton were known as ''[[Plutonism|Plutonists]]'' because they believed that some rocks were formed by ''vulcanism'', which is the deposition of lava from volcanoes, as opposed to the ''[[Neptunism|Neptunists]]'', led by [[Abraham Gottlob Werner|Abraham Werner]], who believed that all rocks had settled out of a large ocean whose level gradually dropped over time.\n\nThe first [[Geologic map of Georgia|geological map of the U.S.]] was produced in 1809 by [[William Maclure]].<ref name=\"Maclure1817\">{{cite book|author=Maclure, William |title=Observations on the Geology of the United States of America: With Some Remarks on the Effect Produced on the Nature and Fertility of Soils, by the Decomposition of the Different Classes of Rocks; and an Application to the Fertility of Every State in the Union, in Reference to the Accompanying Geological Map.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_bgQAAAAIAAJ|year=1817|publisher=Abraham Small|location= Philadelphia}}</ref> In 1807, Maclure commenced the self-imposed task of making a geological survey of the United States.

This book, which influenced the thought of [[Charles Darwin]], successfully promoted the doctrine of [[uniformitarianism]]. This theory states that slow geological processes have occurred throughout the [[History of Earth|Earth's history]] and are still occurring today. In contrast, [[catastrophism]] is the theory that Earth's features formed in single, catastrophic events and remained unchanged thereafter. Though Hutton believed in uniformitarianism, the idea was not widely accepted at the time.\n\nMuch of 19th-century geology revolved around the question of the [[Age of the Earth|Earth's exact age]]. Estimates varied from a few hundred thousand to billions of years.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1130/GSAT01701A.1 |title=John Perry's neglected critique of Kelvin's age for the Earth: A missed opportunity in geodynamics |year=2007 |author=England, Philip |journal=GSA Today |volume=17 |page=4 |last2=Molnar |first2=Peter |last3=Richter |first3=Frank}}</ref> By the early 20th century, [[radiometric dating]] allowed the Earth's age to be estimated at two billion years. The awareness of this vast amount of time opened the door to new theories about the processes that shaped the planet.\n\nSome of the most significant advances in 20th-century geology have been the development of the theory of [[plate tectonics]] in the 1960s and the refinement of estimates of the planet's age. Plate tectonics theory arose from two separate geological observations: [[seafloor spreading]] and [[continental drift]]. The theory revolutionized the [[Earth sciences]].
