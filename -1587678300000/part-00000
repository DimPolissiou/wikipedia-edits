The mission received several extensions and lasted about 2,208 sols. On August 11, 2007, ''Spirit'' obtained the second longest operational duration on the surface of Mars for a lander or rover at 1282 Sols, one sol longer than the [[Viking 2]] lander. Viking 2 was powered by a nuclear cell whereas ''Spirit'' is powered by solar arrays. Until ''Opportunity'' overtook it on May 19, 2010, the Mars probe with longest operational period was [[Viking 1]] that lasted for 2245 Sols on the surface of Mars. On March 22, 2010, ''Spirit'' sent its last communication, thus falling just over a month short of surpassing Viking 1's operational record.

In particular, samples sought will include those that have minerals deposited by water-related processes such as [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], [[Water vapor|evaporation]], [[Sedimentary rock|sedimentary cementation]] or [[hydrothermal activity]].\n* Determine the distribution and composition of minerals, rocks, and soils surrounding the landing sites.\n* Determine what [[Geology of Mars|geologic processes]] have shaped the local terrain and influenced the chemistry. Such processes could include water or wind erosion, sedimentation, hydrothermal mechanisms, volcanism, and cratering.\n* Perform calibration and validation of surface observations made by [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]] instruments. This will help determine the accuracy and effectiveness of various instruments that survey [[Geology of Mars|Martian geology]] from orbit.\n* Search for iron-containing minerals, identify and quantify relative amounts of specific mineral types that contain water or were formed in water, such as iron-bearing carbonates.\n* Characterize the [[mineralogy]] and textures of rocks and soils and determine the processes that created them.\n* Search for geological clues to the [[Environmental science|environmental conditions]] that existed when liquid water was present.\n* Assess whether those environments were conducive to life.\n\nNASA sought evidence of life on Mars, beginning with the question of whether the Martian environment was ever suitable for life. Life forms known to science require water, so the history of [[water on Mars]] is a critical piece of knowledge. Although the Mars Exploration Rovers did not have the ability to detect life directly, they offered very important information on the habitability of the environment during the planet's history.\n\n==Design and construction==\n\n[[File:Mars Exploration Rover.jpg|thumb|right|Annotated rover diagram]]\n[[File:MER Spirit Lander Pan Sol16-A18R1 br2.jpg|thumb|right|''Spirit'' rover images its lander on the surface of Mars on January 18/19, 2004 (''Spirit'' Sol 16)<ref>[http://marsrover.nasa.gov/gallery/press/spirit/20040121a.html NASA.gov], MER-A 20040121a</ref>]]\n[[File:Spirit rock abrasion tool.jpg|thumb|The piece of metal with the American flag on Spirit's rock abrasion tool is made of aluminum recovered from the site of the World Trade Center towers.]]\n{{main|Mars Exploration Rover}}\n{{see also|Comparison of embedded computer systems on board the Mars rovers}}\n\n''Spirit'' (and its twin, ''[[Opportunity rover|Opportunity]]'') are six-wheeled, [[solar panel|solar-powered]] robots standing {{convert|1.5|m|ft|sp=us}} high, {{convert|2.3|m|ft|sp=us}} wide and {{convert|1.6|m|ft|sp=us}} long and weighing {{convert|180|kg|lb}}.

It was the highest resolution image taken on the surface of another planet. According to the camera designer Jim Bell of [[Cornell University]], the panoramic mosaic consists of four pancam images high by three wide. The picture shown originally had a full size of 4,000 by 3,000 [[pixels]]. However, a complete pancam panorama is even 8 times larger than that, and could be taken in stereo (i.e., two complete pictures, making the resolution twice as large again.) The colors are fairly accurate. (For a technical explanation, see [http://areo.info/mer/ colors outside the range of the human eye].)\n\nThe MER pancams are black-and-white instruments. Thirteen rotating filter wheels produce multiple images of the same scene at different wavelengths. Once received on Earth, these images can be combined to produce color images.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lyle.org/~markoff/methods.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050424065044/http://www.lyle.org/~markoff/methods.html|url-status=dead|title=MER color imagery, methods|archivedate=April 24, 2005}}</ref>\n\n==== Sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|01|21}} flash memory management anomaly ====\nOn January 21, 2004 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|01|21}}), ''Spirit'' abruptly ceased communicating with mission control. The next day the rover radioed a 7.8 bit/s beep, confirming that it had received a transmission from Earth but indicating that the craft believed it was in a fault mode. Commands would only be responded to intermittently. This was described as a very serious anomaly, but potentially recoverable if it were a software or memory corruption issue rather than a serious hardware failure. ''Spirit'' was commanded to transmit engineering data, and on January 23 sent several short low-bitrate messages before finally transmitting 73 megabits via [[X band]] to ''[[Mars Odyssey]]''. The readings from the engineering data suggested that the rover was not staying in sleep mode. As such, it was wasting its battery energy and overheating \u2013 risk factors that could potentially destroy the rover if not fixed soon. On sol 20, the command team sent it the command SHUTDWN_DMT_TIL (\"Shutdown Dammit Until\") to try to cause it to suspend itself until a given time. It seemingly ignored the command.\n\nThe leading theory at the time was that the rover was stuck in a \"reboot loop\". The rover was programmed to reboot if there was a fault aboard. However, if there was a fault that occurred during reboot, it would continue to reboot forever. The fact that the problem persisted through reboot suggested that the error was not in RAM, but in either the [[flash memory]], the [[EEPROM]], or a hardware fault. The last case would likely doom the rover. Anticipating the potential for errors in the flash memory and EEPROM, the designers had made it so that the rover could be booted without ever touching the flash memory. The radio itself could decode a limited command set \u2013 enough to tell the rover to reboot without using flash. Without access to flash memory the reboot cycle was broken.\n\nOn January 24, 2004 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|01|24}}) the rover repair team announced that the problem was with ''Spirit'''s flash memory and the software that wrote to it. The flash hardware was believed to be working correctly but the file management module in the software was \"not robust enough\" for the operations the ''Spirit'' was engaged in when the problem occurred, indicating that the problem was caused by a software bug as opposed to faulty hardware. NASA engineers finally came to the conclusion that there were too many files on the file system, which was a relatively minor problem. Most of these files contained unneeded in-flight data. After realizing what the problem was, the engineers deleted some files, and eventually reformatted the entire flash memory system. On February 6 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|02|06}}), the rover was restored to its original working condition, and science activities resumed.<ref name=\"planetary\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20110719212649/http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00000702/ Planetary Blog].</ref>\n\n==== First intentional grinding of a rock on Mars ====\n[[File:Rat post grind.jpg|thumb|right|Digital camera (the [[Pancam]]) image of a Mars rock (called [[Adirondack (Mars)|Adirondack]]) taken after a [[Rock Abrasion Tool|RAT]] grind (the rock grinding tool)]]\nFor the first intentional grinding of a rock on Mars, the ''Spirit'' team chose a rock called \"[[Adirondack (Mars)|Adirondack]]\". To make the drive there, the rover turned 40 degrees in short arcs totaling {{convert|95|cm}}. It then turned in place to face the target rock and drove four short moves straightforward totaling {{cvt|1.9|m}}. Adirondack was chosen over another rock called \"Sashimi\", which was closer to the rover, as Adirondack's surface was smoother, making it more suitable for the [[Rock Abrasion Tool]] (aka \"RAT\").<ref>{{cite press release |last=Webster |first=Guy |date=January 19, 2004 |title=Spirit Drives to a Rock Called 'Adirondack' for Close Inspection |url=https://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mer/newsroom/pressreleases/20040119a.html |publisher=NASA |access-date=2018-01-02}}</ref>\n\n''Spirit'' made a small depression in the rock, {{convert|45.5|mm}} in diameter and {{convert|2.65|mm}} deep.

Raymond Arvidson, the McDonnell University Professor and chair of Earth and Planetary Sciences at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], reported during a NASA press conference: \"If we found this rock on Earth, we would say it is a volcanic rock that had a little fluid moving through it.\" In contrast to the rocks found by the twin rover ''Opportunity'', this one was formed from [[magma]] and then acquired bright material in small crevices, which look like crystallized minerals. If this interpretation holds true, the minerals were most likely dissolved in water, which was either carried inside the rock or interacted with it at a later stage, after it formed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20040305a.html|title=Mars Exploration Rover|last=mars.nasa.gov|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\n==== Bonneville crater ====\nOn sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|03|11}} March 11, 2004, ''Spirit'' reached [[Bonneville (crater)|Bonneville crater]] after a {{convert|400|yd|m|adj=on|sp=us}} journey.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} This crater is about {{convert|200|m|yd|sp=us}} across with a floor about {{convert|10|m|yd|sp=us}} [[Crater depth|below]] the surface.<ref>{{cite web |title=Surfical geology of the Spirit rover traverse in Gusev Crater: dry and desiccating since the Hesperian |url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/earlymars2004/pdf/8055.pdf |conference=Second Conference on Early Mars (2004) |accessdate=January 26, 2009 |author=Golombek|page=1 |quote=The rim is ~{{convert|3|m|ft|sp=us}} high and although the crater is shallow (~{{convert|10|m|ft|sp=us}} deep)|display-authors=etal}}</ref> JPL decided that it would be a bad idea to send the rover down into the crater, as they saw no targets of interest inside. ''Spirit'' drove along the southern rim and continued to the southwest towards the Columbia Hills.\n{{wide image|PIA05591 Spirit's Destination (panorama).jpg|800px|Bonneville Crater}}\n\n''Spirit'' reached Missoula crater on sol 105. The crater is roughly {{convert|100|yd|m|sp=us}} across and {{convert|20|yd|m|sp=us}} deep. Missoula crater was not considered a high priority target due to the older rocks it contained. The rover skirted the northern rim, and continued to the southeast.\nIt then reached Lahontan crater on sol 118, and drove along the rim until sol 120. Lahontan is about {{convert|60|yd|m|sp=us}} across and about {{convert|10|yd|m|sp=us}} deep. A long, snaking sand dune stretches away from its southwestern side, and ''Spirit'' went around it, because loose sand dunes present an unknown risk to the ability of the rover wheels to get traction.\n\n==== Columbia Hills ====\n''Spirit'' drove from Bonneville crater in a direct line to the Columbia Hills. The route was only directly controlled by the engineers when the terrain was difficult to navigate; otherwise, the rover drove in an autonomous mode. On sol 159, ''Spirit'' reached the first of many targets at the base of the [[Columbia Hills (Mars)|Columbia Hills]] called West Spur. Hank's Hollow was studied for 23 sols. Within Hank's Hollow was the strange-looking rock dubbed \"[[Pot of Gold (Mars)|Pot of Gold]]\". Analysing this rock was difficult for Spirit, because it lay in a slippery area. After a detailed analysis with the AXPS-and the M\u00f6\u00dfbauer instrument it was detected that it contains hematite.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2004-161 | title = Mars Rovers Surprises Continue | work = JPL website | accessdate = 2006-10-06}}</ref> This kind of rock can  be built in connection with water.\n\nAs the produced energy from the solar panels was lowering due to the setting sun and dust the Deep Sleep Mode was introduced. In this mode the rover was shut down completely during the night in order to save energy, even if the instruments would fail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll_2004.html#sol171|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref> The route was selected so that the rover's panels were tilted as much as possible towards the winter sun.\n\nFrom here, ''Spirit'' took a northerly path along the base of the hill towards the target Wooly Patch, which was studied from sol 192 to sol 199. By sol 203, ''Spirit'' had driven southward up the hill and arrived at the rock dubbed \"Clovis\". Clovis was ground and analyzed from sol 210 to sol 225. Following Clovis came the targets of Ebenezer (Sols 226\u2013235), Tetl (sol 270), Uchben and Palinque (Sols 281\u2013295), and Lutefisk (Sols 296\u2013303). From Sols 239 to 262, ''Spirit'' powered down for [[solar conjunction]], when communications with the Earth are blocked. Slowly, ''Spirit'' made its way around the summit of Husband Hill, and at sol 344 was ready to climb over the newly designated \"Cumberland Ridge\" and into \"[[Larry's Lookout]]\" and \"Tennessee Valley\". ''Spirit'' also did some communication tests with the ESA orbiter ''[[Mars Express]]'' though most of the communication was usually done with the NASA orbiters ''[[2001 Mars Odyssey|Mars Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Mars Global Surveyor]]''.\n\n=== 2005 ===\n\n==== Driving up to Husband Hill ====\n''Spirit'' had now been on Mars for one Earth year and was driving slowly uphill towards the top of Husband Hill. This was difficult because there were many rocky obstacles and sandy parts. This lead frequently to a slippage and the route could not be driven as planned. In February ''Spirit'''s computer received a software update in order to drive more autonomously.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll_2005.html#sol416|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref> On sol 371, ''Spirit'' arrived at a rock named \"Peace\" near the top of Cumberland Ridge. ''Spirit'' ground ''Peace'' with the RAT on sol 373. By sol 390 (mid-February 2005), ''Spirit'' was advancing towards \"Larry's Lookout\", by driving up the hill in reverse. The scientists at this time were trying to conserve as much energy as possible for the climb.\n\n''Spirit'' also investigated some targets along the way, including the soil target, \"Paso Robles\", which contained the highest amount of salt found on the red planet. The soil also contained a high amount of [[phosphorus]] in its composition, however not nearly as high as another rock sampled by ''Spirit'', \"Wishstone\".

NASA scientists speculate a dust devil must have swept the solar panels clean, possibly significantly extending the duration of the mission. This also marks the first time dust devils had been spotted by ''Spirit'' or ''Opportunity'', and is easily one of the top highlights of the mission to date. Dust devils had previously only been photographed by the ''[[Mars Pathfinder|Pathfinder]]'' probe.\n\nMission members monitoring ''Spirit'' on Mars reported on March 12, 2005 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2005|03|12}}), that a lucky encounter with a dust devil had cleaned the robot's solar panels. Energy levels dramatically increased and daily science work was anticipated to be expanded.<ref>{{cite web | last = David | first = Leonard | date = March 12, 2005 | url = http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/spirit_dust_050312.html | title = Spirit Gets A Dust Devil Once-Over | publisher = Space.com | accessdate =December 1, 2006}}</ref>\n \n[[File:Marsdustdevil2.gif|thumb|center|800px|Video of a dust devil on Mars, photographed by ''Spirit''.

The rover was the first spacecraft to climb atop a mountain on another planet. The whole distance driven totaled 4971 meters.\nThe summit itself was flat. ''Spirit'' took a 360 degree panorama in real color, which included the whole Gusev crater. At night the rover observed the moons [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]] in order to determine their orbits better.<ref name=\"nasa_2010_189\">{{cite web \n|authors=Staff |title=NASA Rover Finds Clue to Mars' Past And Environment for Life |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/news/mer20100603.html |work=[[NASA]] |date=2010-06-03 |accessdate=2011-05-25}}</ref> On sol 656 ''Spirit'' surveyed the Mars sky and the opacity of the atmosphere with its pancam to make a coordinated science campaign with the Hubble Space Telescope in Earth orbit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll_2005.html#sol655|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\nFrom the peak ''Spirit'' spotted a striking formation, which was dubbed \"Home Plate\". This was an interesting target, but ''Spirit'' would be driven later to the McCool Hill to tilt its solar panels towards the sun in the coming winter. At the end of October the rover was driven downhill and to Home Plate. On the way down ''Spirit'' reached the rock formation named \"Comanche\" on sol 690. Scientists used data from all three spectrometers to find out that about one-fourth of the composition of Comanche is magnesium iron carbonate. That concentration is 10 times higher than for any previously identified carbonate in a Martian rock. Carbonates originate in wet, near-neutral conditions but dissolve in acid. The find at Comanche is the first unambiguous evidence from the Mars Exploration Mission rovers for a past Martian environment that may have been more favorable to life than the wet but acidic conditions indicated by the rovers' earlier finds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/multimedia/gallery/comanche-no-label.html|title=NASA \u2013 Carbonate-Containing Martian Rocks (False Color)|website=www.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\n{{Wide image|Everest Panorama from Mars.jpg|1100px|View from the Summit taken by ''Spirit'' on August 23, 2005, as the rover completed the climb up Husband Hill.}}\n\n=== 2006 ===\n\n==== Driving to McCool Hill ====\nIn 2006 ''Spirit'' drove towards an area dubbed Home Plate, and reached it in February.

On March 16, 2006 JPL announced that ''Spirit's'' troublesome front wheel had stopped working altogether. Despite this, ''Spirit'' was still making progress toward McCool Hill because the control team programmed the rover to drive toward McCool Hill backwards, dragging its broken wheel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll.html#sol778|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref>  In late March, ''Spirit'' encountered loose soil that was impeding its progress toward McCool Hill. A decision was made to terminate attempts to reach McCool Hill and instead park on a nearby ridge named Low Ridge Haven.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right \n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Home plate anim.gif\n| width1    = {{#expr: (130 * 331 / 285 ) round 0}}\n| alt1      = \n| caption1  = Curious rock near edge of \"Home Plate\" with a jutting portion.

The rover made its first drive, a short turn to position targets of interest within reach of the robotic arm, in early November 2006, following the shortest days of winter and solar conjunction when communications with Earth were severely limited.\n\nWhile at Low Ridge, ''Spirit'' imaged two rocks of similar chemical nature to that of ''Opportunity'''s [[Heat Shield Rock]], a [[meteorite]] on the surface of Mars. Named \"Zhong Shan\" for [[Sun Yat-sen]] and \"Allan Hills\" for the [[Allan Hills|location]] in [[Antarctica]] where several Martian meteorites have been found, they stood out against the background rocks that were darker. Further spectrographic testing is being done to determine the exact composition of these rocks, which may turn out to also be meteorites.\n\n=== 2007 ===\n\n==== Software upgrade ====\nOn January 4, 2007 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2007|01|04}}), both rovers received new flight software to the onboard computers. The update was received just in time for the third anniversary of their landing. The new systems let the rovers decide whether or not to transmit an image, and whether or not to extend their arms to examine rocks, which would save much time for scientists as they would not have to sift through hundreds of images to find the one they want, or examine the surroundings to decide to extend the arms and examine the rocks.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2007/01/04/tech-mars.html | work=CBC News | title=Old rovers learn new tricks | date=January 4, 2007}}</ref>\n\n====Silica Valley====\n[[File:Spirit Mars Silica April 20 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Rover exposes silica-rich dust]]\n''Spirit'''s dead wheel turned out to have a silver lining. As it was traveling in March 2007, pulling the dead wheel behind, the wheel scraped off the upper layer of the Martian soil, uncovering a patch of ground that scientists say shows evidence of a past environment that would have been perfect for microbial life. It is similar to areas on Earth where water or steam from hot springs came into contact with volcanic rocks. On Earth, these are locations that tend to teem with bacteria, said rover chief scientist [[Steve Squyres]]. \"We're really excited about this,\" he told a meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU). The area is extremely rich in [[Silicon dioxide|silica]]\u2013the main ingredient of window glass. The researchers have now concluded that the bright material must have been produced in one of two ways. One: hot-spring deposits produced when water dissolved silica at one location and then carried it to another (i.e. a geyser). Two: acidic steam rising through cracks in rocks  stripped them of their mineral components, leaving silica behind. \"The important thing is that whether it is one hypothesis or the other, the implications for the former habitability of Mars are pretty much the same,\" Squyres explained to BBC News. Hot water provides an environment in which [[microbe]]s can thrive and the precipitation of that silica entombs and preserves them. Squyres added, \"You can go to [[hot spring]]s and you can go to [[fumarole]]s and at either place on Earth it is teeming with life \u2013 [[Microorganism|microbial life]].\"<ref name=\"Amos\">{{cite news  | last = Amos  | first = Jonathan    | title = Mars robot unearths microbe clue   | work = NASA says its robot rover Spirit has made one of its most significant discoveries on the surface of Mars. |publisher=BBC News  | date = December 11, 2007 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7137793.stm  | accessdate =December 12, 2007 }}</ref><ref name=\"20071210a\">{{cite web  | last = Bertster  | first =  Guy   | title = Mars Rover Investigates Signs of Steamy Martian Past  | work = Press Release  | publisher = Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California  | date = December 10, 2007  | url = http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20071210a.html  | accessdate =December 12, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==== Global dust storm and Home Plate ====\nDuring 2007 ''Spirit'' spent several months near the base of the Home Plate plateau. On sol 1306 ''Spirit'' climbed onto the eastern edge of the plateau. In September and October it examined rocks and soils at several locations on the southern half of the plateau. On November 6, ''Spirit'' had reached the western edge of Home Plate, and started taking pictures for a panoramic overview of the western valley, with Grissom Hill and Husband Hill visible. The panorama image was published on NASA's website on January 3, 2008 to little attention, until January 23, when an independent website published a magnified detail of the image that showed a rock feature a few centimeters high resembling a humanoid figure seen from the side with its right arm partially raised.<ref>[http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00001305/ Planetary.org] Emily Lakdawalla, ''Teeny little Bigfoot on Mars'', January 23, 2008 | 12:41 PST | 20:41 UTC</ref><ref>{{Cite APOD |date=January 29, 2008 |title=Spirit's West Valley Panorama image |access-date=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Mars Spirit rover's solar panels covered with Dust - October 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Circular projection showing ''Spirit'''s solar panels covered in dust \u2013 October 2007]]\nTowards the end of June 2007, a series of dust storms began clouding the Martian atmosphere with dust. The storms intensified and by July 20, both ''Spirit'' and ''Opportunity'' were facing the real possibility of system failure due to lack of energy. NASA released a statement to the press that said (in part) \"We're rooting for our rovers to survive these storms, but they were never designed for conditions this intense\".<ref>{{Cite press| url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2007-080| accessdate=August 21, 2009| title=NASA Mars Rovers Braving Severe Dust Storms| date=July 27, 2007| publisher=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]}}</ref> The key problem caused by the dust storms was a dramatic reduction in solar energy caused by there being so much dust in the atmosphere that it was blocking 99 percent of direct sunlight to ''Opportunity'', and slightly more to ''Spirit''.\n\nNormally the solar arrays on the rovers are able to generate up to {{Convert|700|Wh}} of energy per [[Martian day]]. After the storms, the amount of energy generated was greatly reduced to {{Convert|128|Wh}}. If the rovers generate less than {{Convert|150|Wh}} per day they must start draining their batteries to run survival heaters. If the batteries run dry, key electrical elements are likely to fail due to the intense cold. Both rovers were put into the lowest-power setting in order to wait out the storms. In early August the storms began to clear slightly, allowing the rovers to successfully charge their batteries. They were kept in hibernation in order to wait out the remainder of the storm.<ref>{{Cite press| url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20070807a.html| accessdate=August 21, 2009| title=Martian Skies Brighten Slightly| date=August 7, 2007| publisher=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]}}</ref>\n\n=== 2008 ===\n\n==== Hibernating ====\nThe main concern was the energy level for ''Spirit''. To increase the amount of light hitting the solar panels, the rover was parked in the northern part of Home Plate on as steep a slope as possible. It was expected that the level of dust cover on the solar panels would increase by 70 percent and that a slope of 30 degrees would be necessary to survive the winter. In February, a tilt of 29.9 degrees was achieved. Extra energy was available at times, and a high definition panorama named ''Bonestell'' was produced. At other times when there was only enough solar energy to recharge the batteries, communication with Earth was minimized and all unnecessary instruments were switched off. At winter solstice the energy production declined to 235 watt hours per sol.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll_2008.html|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\n==== Winter dust storm ====\nOn November 10, 2008, a large dust storm further reduced the output of the solar panels to {{Convert|89|Wh}} per day\u2014a critically low level.<ref>{{Cite press| url=http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20081110a.html |accessdate=August 21, 2009|title=Dust Storm Cuts Energy Supply of NASA Mars Rover Spirit| date= November 10, 2008| publisher=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]}}</ref> NASA officials were hopeful that ''Spirit'' would survive the storm, and that the energy level would rise once the storm had passed and the skies started clearing.

It is also possible that the rover had experienced a mission clock fault. If that had happened, the rover would have lost track of time and tried to remain asleep until enough sunlight struck the solar arrays to wake it. This state is called \"Solar Groovy.\" If the rover woke up from a mission clock fault, it would only listen. Starting on July 26, 2010 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2010|07|26}}), a new procedure to address the possible mission clock fault was implemented.\n\nEach sol, the Deep Space Network mission controllers sent a set of X-band \"Sweep & Beep\" commands. If the rover had experienced a mission clock fault and then had been awoken during the day, it would have listened during brief, 20-minute intervals during each hour awake. Due to the possible clock fault, the timing of these 20-minute listening intervals was not known, so multiple \"Sweep & Beep\" commands were sent.

Sulfate was found, and it needs water to form. \nWishstone contained a great deal of plagioclase, some olivine, and [[anhydrate]] (a sulfate). Peace rocks showed [[sulfur]] and strong evidence for bound water, so hydrated sulfates are suspected. Watchtower class rocks lack olivine consequently they may have been altered by water. The Independence class showed some signs of clay (perhaps montmorillonite a member of the smectite group). Clays require fairly long term exposure to water to form.\nOne type of soil, called Paso Robles, from the Columbia Hills, may be an evaporate deposit because it contains large amounts of sulfur, [[phosphorus]], [[calcium]], and iron.<ref name=\"Ming2005JE002560\" />\nAlso, MB found that much of the iron in Paso Robles soil was of the oxidized, Fe<sup>3+</sup> form, which would happen if water had been present.<ref name=\"Bell\" />\n\nTowards the middle of the six-year mission (a mission that was supposed to last only 90 days), large amounts of pure [[silica]] were found in the soil.<ref name=\"Sky & Telescope\">{{cite web|url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/19177609.html|title=Mars Rover Uncovers Ancient Hot Springs|publisher=SkyandTelescope.com|date=2008-05-22|accessdate=2012-08-01}}</ref>  The silica could have come from the interaction of soil with acid vapors produced by volcanic activity in the presence of water or from water in a hot spring environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/mer-20070521.html|title=NASA \u2013 Mars Rover Spirit Unearths Surprise Evidence of Wetter Past|website=www.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\nAfter ''Spirit'' stopped working scientists studied old data from the Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer, or [[Mini-TES]] and confirmed the presence of large amounts of [[carbonate]]-rich rocks, which means that regions of the planet may have once harbored water.

However, in the Columbia Hills there was clear evidence for a moderate amount of aqueous weathering. The evidence included sulfates and the minerals goethite and carbonates that only form in the presence of water. It is believed that Gusev crater may have held a lake long ago, but it has since been covered by igneous materials. All the dust contains a magnetic component that was identified as magnetite with some titanium. Furthermore, the thin coating of dust that covers everything on Mars is the same in all parts of Mars.\n\n==Astronomy==\n{{see also|Astronomy on Mars}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = PIA05547-Spirit Rover-Earth seen from Mars.png\n| width1 = {{#expr: (200 * (1194 / 1007)) round 0}}\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = [[Earth]] from Mars\n| image2 = Phobos & Deimos full thumb.png\n| width2 = {{#expr: (200 * (200 / 213)) round 0}}\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = Night sky of Mars showing [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]] (left) and [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] (right) in front of [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], as seen by [[Mars Exploration Rover]] ''Spirit'' on August 26, 2005.

However, in mid-December 2009, to the surprise of the engineers, the right front wheel showed slight movement in a wheel-test on sol 2113 and clearly rotated with normal resistance on three of four wheel-tests on sol 2117, but stalled on the fourth.

The mission received several extensions and lasted about 2,208 sols. On August 11, 2007, ''Spirit'' obtained the second longest operational duration on the surface of Mars for a lander or rover at 1282 Sols, one sol longer than the [[Viking 2]] lander. Viking 2 was powered by a nuclear cell whereas ''Spirit'' is powered by solar arrays. Until ''Opportunity'' overtook it on May 19, 2010, the Mars probe with longest operational period was [[Viking 1]] that lasted for 2245 Sols on the surface of Mars. On March 22, 2010, ''Spirit'' sent its last communication, thus falling just over a month short of surpassing Viking 1's operational record.

In particular, samples sought will include those that have minerals deposited by water-related processes such as [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], [[Water vapor|evaporation]], [[Sedimentary rock|sedimentary cementation]] or [[hydrothermal activity]].\n* Determine the distribution and composition of minerals, rocks, and soils surrounding the landing sites.\n* Determine what [[Geology of Mars|geologic processes]] have shaped the local terrain and influenced the chemistry. Such processes could include water or wind erosion, sedimentation, hydrothermal mechanisms, volcanism, and cratering.\n* Perform calibration and validation of surface observations made by [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]] instruments. This will help determine the accuracy and effectiveness of various instruments that survey [[Geology of Mars|Martian geology]] from orbit.\n* Search for iron-containing minerals, identify and quantify relative amounts of specific mineral types that contain water or were formed in water, such as iron-bearing carbonates.\n* Characterize the [[mineralogy]] and textures of rocks and soils and determine the processes that created them.\n* Search for geological clues to the [[Environmental science|environmental conditions]] that existed when liquid water was present.\n* Assess whether those environments were conducive to life.\n\nNASA sought evidence of life on Mars, beginning with the question of whether the Martian environment was ever suitable for life. Life forms known to science require water, so the history of [[water on Mars]] is a critical piece of knowledge. Although the Mars Exploration Rovers did not have the ability to detect life directly, they offered very important information on the habitability of the environment during the planet's history.\n\n==Design and construction==\n\n[[File:Mars Exploration Rover.jpg|thumb|right|Annotated rover diagram]]\n[[File:MER Spirit Lander Pan Sol16-A18R1 br2.jpg|thumb|right|''Spirit'' rover images its lander on the surface of Mars on January 18/19, 2004 (''Spirit'' Sol 16)<ref>[http://marsrover.nasa.gov/gallery/press/spirit/20040121a.html NASA.gov], MER-A 20040121a</ref>]]\n[[File:Spirit rock abrasion tool.jpg|thumb|The piece of metal with the American flag on Spirit's rock abrasion tool is made of aluminum recovered from the site of the World Trade Center towers.]]\n{{main|Mars Exploration Rover}}\n{{see also|Comparison of embedded computer systems on board the Mars rovers}}\n\n''Spirit'' (and its twin, ''[[Opportunity rover|Opportunity]]'') are six-wheeled, [[solar panel|solar-powered]] robots standing {{convert|1.5|m|ft|sp=us}} high, {{convert|2.3|m|ft|sp=us}} wide and {{convert|1.6|m|ft|sp=us}} long and weighing {{convert|180|kg|lb}}.

A low gain antenna is also used to relay data to spacecraft orbiting Mars.\n\n===Science payload===\n\nThe science instruments include:\n\n* [[Pancam|Panoramic Camera (Pancam)]] \u2013 examines the texture, color, mineralogy, and structure of the local terrain.\n* [[Navcam|Navigation Camera (Navcam)]] \u2013 monochrome with a higher field of view but lower resolution, for navigation and driving.\n* [[Mini-TES|Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES)]] \u2013 identifies promising rocks and soils for closer examination, and determines the processes that formed them.\n* [[Hazcam]]s, two B&W cameras with 120 degree field of view, that provide additional data about the rover's surroundings.\n\nThe rover arm holds the following instruments:\n\n* [[M\u00f6ssbauer spectrometer]] (MB) [[MIMOS II]] \u2013 used for close-up investigations of the mineralogy of iron-bearing rocks and soils.\n* [[Alpha particle X-ray spectrometer]] (APXS) \u2013 close-up analysis of the abundances of elements that make up rocks and soils.\n* Magnets \u2013 for collecting magnetic dust particles.\n* Microscopic Imager (MI) \u2013 obtains close-up, high-resolution images of rocks and soils.\n* [[Rock Abrasion Tool]] (RAT) \u2013 exposes fresh material for examination by instruments on board.\n\n== Mission timeline ==\n\n=== 2004 ===\nThe ''Spirit'' Mars rover and lander arrived successfully on the surface of Mars on 04:35 [[Ground UTC]] on January 4, 2004. This was the start of its 90-sol mission, but solar cell cleaning events would mean it was the start of a much longer mission, lasting until 2010.\n\n==== Landing site: ''Columbia'' Memorial Station ====\n[[Image:Columbia Hills from MER-A landing site PIA05200 br2.jpg|thumb|right|Annotated Columbia Hills panorama from the ''Spirit'' landing site]]\n''Spirit'' was targeted to a site that appears to have been affected by liquid water in the past, the crater [[Gusev (Martian crater)|Gusev]], a possible former lake in a giant [[impact crater]] about {{convert|10|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} from the center of the target ellipse<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsoweb.nas.nasa.gov/landingsites/mer2003/topsites/final/Gusev/|title=Gusev Crater: LandingSites|website=marsoweb.nas.nasa.gov}}</ref> at {{Coord|14.5718|S|175.4785|E|globe:mars_type:landmark}}.<ref>[http://www.spaceflightnow.com/mars/mera/040113exploration.html Spaceflightnow.com], Destination Mars, Rover headed toward hilly vista for martian exploration<!-- Bot generated title --></ref>\n\nAfter the airbag-protected landing craft settled onto the surface, the rover rolled out to take panoramic images. These give scientists the information they need to select promising geological targets and drive to those locations to perform on-site scientific investigations. The panoramic image below shows a slightly rolling surface, littered with small rocks, with hills on the horizon up to {{convert|3|km|mi|sp=us}} away.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap040114.html|title=APOD: 2004 January 14 \u2013 A Mars Panorama from the Spirit Rover|website=antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov}}</ref> The MER team named the landing site \"''Columbia'' Memorial Station,\" in honor of the seven [[astronauts]] killed in the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'' disaster]].\n\n\"[[Sleepy Hollow (Mars)|Sleepy Hollow]],\" a shallow depression in the Mars ground at the right side of the above picture, was targeted as an early destination when the rover drove off its lander platform. NASA scientists were very interested in this crater. It is {{convert|9|m|ft|sp=us}} across and about {{convert|12|m|ft|sp=us}} north of the lander.\n\n==== First color image ====\n[[File:Spirit's First Color Photograph Mars.jpg|thumb|right|First color image compiled from images by ''Spirit''; it was the highest resolution color image taken on another planet.]] \nTo the right is the first color image derived from images taken by the panoramic camera on the Mars Exploration Rover ''Spirit''. It was the highest resolution image taken on the surface of another planet. According to the camera designer Jim Bell of [[Cornell University]], the panoramic mosaic consists of four pancam images high by three wide. The picture shown originally had a full size of 4,000 by 3,000 [[pixels]]. However, a complete pancam panorama is even 8 times larger than that, and could be taken in stereo (i.e., two complete pictures, making the resolution twice as large again.) The colors are fairly accurate. (For a technical explanation, see [http://areo.info/mer/ colors outside the range of the human eye].)\n\nThe MER pancams are black-and-white instruments. Thirteen rotating filter wheels produce multiple images of the same scene at different wavelengths. Once received on Earth, these images can be combined to produce color images.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lyle.org/~markoff/methods.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050424065044/http://www.lyle.org/~markoff/methods.html|url-status=dead|title=MER color imagery, methods|archivedate=April 24, 2005}}</ref>\n\n==== Sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|01|21}} flash memory management anomaly ====\nOn January 21, 2004 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|01|21}}), ''Spirit'' abruptly ceased communicating with mission control. The next day the rover radioed a 7.8 bit/s beep, confirming that it had received a transmission from Earth but indicating that the craft believed it was in a fault mode. Commands would only be responded to intermittently. This was described as a very serious anomaly, but potentially recoverable if it were a software or memory corruption issue rather than a serious hardware failure. ''Spirit'' was commanded to transmit engineering data, and on January 23 sent several short low-bitrate messages before finally transmitting 73 megabits via [[X band]] to ''[[Mars Odyssey]]''. The readings from the engineering data suggested that the rover was not staying in sleep mode. As such, it was wasting its battery energy and overheating \u2013 risk factors that could potentially destroy the rover if not fixed soon. On sol 20, the command team sent it the command SHUTDWN_DMT_TIL (\"Shutdown Dammit Until\") to try to cause it to suspend itself until a given time. It seemingly ignored the command.\n\nThe leading theory at the time was that the rover was stuck in a \"reboot loop\". The rover was programmed to reboot if there was a fault aboard. However, if there was a fault that occurred during reboot, it would continue to reboot forever. The fact that the problem persisted through reboot suggested that the error was not in RAM, but in either the [[flash memory]], the [[EEPROM]], or a hardware fault. The last case would likely doom the rover. Anticipating the potential for errors in the flash memory and EEPROM, the designers had made it so that the rover could be booted without ever touching the flash memory. The radio itself could decode a limited command set \u2013 enough to tell the rover to reboot without using flash. Without access to flash memory the reboot cycle was broken.\n\nOn January 24, 2004 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|01|24}}) the rover repair team announced that the problem was with ''Spirit'''s flash memory and the software that wrote to it. The flash hardware was believed to be working correctly but the file management module in the software was \"not robust enough\" for the operations the ''Spirit'' was engaged in when the problem occurred, indicating that the problem was caused by a software bug as opposed to faulty hardware. NASA engineers finally came to the conclusion that there were too many files on the file system, which was a relatively minor problem. Most of these files contained unneeded in-flight data. After realizing what the problem was, the engineers deleted some files, and eventually reformatted the entire flash memory system. On February 6 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|02|06}}), the rover was restored to its original working condition, and science activities resumed.<ref name=\"planetary\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20110719212649/http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00000702/ Planetary Blog].</ref>\n\n==== First intentional grinding of a rock on Mars ====\n[[File:Rat post grind.jpg|thumb|right|Digital camera (the [[Pancam]]) image of a Mars rock (called [[Adirondack (Mars)|Adirondack]]) taken after a [[Rock Abrasion Tool|RAT]] grind (the rock grinding tool)]]\nFor the first intentional grinding of a rock on Mars, the ''Spirit'' team chose a rock called \"[[Adirondack (Mars)|Adirondack]]\". To make the drive there, the rover turned 40 degrees in short arcs totaling {{convert|95|cm}}. It then turned in place to face the target rock and drove four short moves straightforward totaling {{cvt|1.9|m}}. Adirondack was chosen over another rock called \"Sashimi\", which was closer to the rover, as Adirondack's surface was smoother, making it more suitable for the [[Rock Abrasion Tool]] (aka \"RAT\").<ref>{{cite press release |last=Webster |first=Guy |date=January 19, 2004 |title=Spirit Drives to a Rock Called 'Adirondack' for Close Inspection |url=https://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mer/newsroom/pressreleases/20040119a.html |publisher=NASA |access-date=2018-01-02}}</ref>\n\n''Spirit'' made a small depression in the rock, {{convert|45.5|mm}} in diameter and {{convert|2.65|mm}} deep.

Raymond Arvidson, the McDonnell University Professor and chair of Earth and Planetary Sciences at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], reported during a NASA press conference: \"If we found this rock on Earth, we would say it is a volcanic rock that had a little fluid moving through it.\" In contrast to the rocks found by the twin rover ''Opportunity'', this one was formed from [[magma]] and then acquired bright material in small crevices, which look like crystallized minerals. If this interpretation holds true, the minerals were most likely dissolved in water, which was either carried inside the rock or interacted with it at a later stage, after it formed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20040305a.html|title=Mars Exploration Rover|last=mars.nasa.gov|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\n==== Bonneville crater ====\nOn sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|03|11}} March 11, 2004, ''Spirit'' reached [[Bonneville (crater)|Bonneville crater]] after a {{convert|400|yd|m|adj=on|sp=us}} journey.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} This crater is about {{convert|200|m|yd|sp=us}} across with a floor about {{convert|10|m|yd|sp=us}} [[Crater depth|below]] the surface.<ref>{{cite web |title=Surfical geology of the Spirit rover traverse in Gusev Crater: dry and desiccating since the Hesperian |url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/earlymars2004/pdf/8055.pdf |conference=Second Conference on Early Mars (2004) |accessdate=January 26, 2009 |author=Golombek|page=1 |quote=The rim is ~{{convert|3|m|ft|sp=us}} high and although the crater is shallow (~{{convert|10|m|ft|sp=us}} deep)|display-authors=etal}}</ref> JPL decided that it would be a bad idea to send the rover down into the crater, as they saw no targets of interest inside. ''Spirit'' drove along the southern rim and continued to the southwest towards the Columbia Hills.\n{{wide image|PIA05591 Spirit's Destination (panorama).jpg|800px|Bonneville Crater}}\n\n''Spirit'' reached Missoula crater on sol 105. The crater is roughly {{convert|100|yd|m|sp=us}} across and {{convert|20|yd|m|sp=us}} deep. Missoula crater was not considered a high priority target due to the older rocks it contained. The rover skirted the northern rim, and continued to the southeast.\nIt then reached Lahontan crater on sol 118, and drove along the rim until sol 120. Lahontan is about {{convert|60|yd|m|sp=us}} across and about {{convert|10|yd|m|sp=us}} deep. A long, snaking sand dune stretches away from its southwestern side, and ''Spirit'' went around it, because loose sand dunes present an unknown risk to the ability of the rover wheels to get traction.\n\n==== Columbia Hills ====\n''Spirit'' drove from Bonneville crater in a direct line to the Columbia Hills. The route was only directly controlled by the engineers when the terrain was difficult to navigate; otherwise, the rover drove in an autonomous mode. On sol 159, ''Spirit'' reached the first of many targets at the base of the [[Columbia Hills (Mars)|Columbia Hills]] called West Spur. Hank's Hollow was studied for 23 sols. Within Hank's Hollow was the strange-looking rock dubbed \"[[Pot of Gold (Mars)|Pot of Gold]]\". Analysing this rock was difficult for Spirit, because it lay in a slippery area. After a detailed analysis with the AXPS-and the M\u00f6\u00dfbauer instrument it was detected that it contains hematite.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2004-161 | title = Mars Rovers Surprises Continue | work = JPL website | accessdate = 2006-10-06}}</ref> This kind of rock can  be built in connection with water.\n\nAs the produced energy from the solar panels was lowering due to the setting sun and dust the Deep Sleep Mode was introduced. In this mode the rover was shut down completely during the night in order to save energy, even if the instruments would fail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll_2004.html#sol171|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref> The route was selected so that the rover's panels were tilted as much as possible towards the winter sun.\n\nFrom here, ''Spirit'' took a northerly path along the base of the hill towards the target Wooly Patch, which was studied from sol 192 to sol 199. By sol 203, ''Spirit'' had driven southward up the hill and arrived at the rock dubbed \"Clovis\". Clovis was ground and analyzed from sol 210 to sol 225. Following Clovis came the targets of Ebenezer (Sols 226\u2013235), Tetl (sol 270), Uchben and Palinque (Sols 281\u2013295), and Lutefisk (Sols 296\u2013303). From Sols 239 to 262, ''Spirit'' powered down for [[solar conjunction]], when communications with the Earth are blocked. Slowly, ''Spirit'' made its way around the summit of Husband Hill, and at sol 344 was ready to climb over the newly designated \"Cumberland Ridge\" and into \"[[Larry's Lookout]]\" and \"Tennessee Valley\". ''Spirit'' also did some communication tests with the ESA orbiter ''[[Mars Express]]'' though most of the communication was usually done with the NASA orbiters ''[[2001 Mars Odyssey|Mars Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Mars Global Surveyor]]''.\n\n=== 2005 ===\n\n==== Driving up to Husband Hill ====\n''Spirit'' had now been on Mars for one Earth year and was driving slowly uphill towards the top of Husband Hill. This was difficult because there were many rocky obstacles and sandy parts. This lead frequently to a slippage and the route could not be driven as planned. In February ''Spirit'''s computer received a software update in order to drive more autonomously.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll_2005.html#sol416|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref> On sol 371, ''Spirit'' arrived at a rock named \"Peace\" near the top of Cumberland Ridge. ''Spirit'' ground ''Peace'' with the RAT on sol 373. By sol 390 (mid-February 2005), ''Spirit'' was advancing towards \"Larry's Lookout\", by driving up the hill in reverse. The scientists at this time were trying to conserve as much energy as possible for the climb.\n\n''Spirit'' also investigated some targets along the way, including the soil target, \"Paso Robles\", which contained the highest amount of salt found on the red planet. The soil also contained a high amount of [[phosphorus]] in its composition, however not nearly as high as another rock sampled by ''Spirit'', \"Wishstone\". Squyres said of the discovery, \"We're still trying to work out what this means, but clearly, with this much salt around, water had a hand here\".\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nImage:Pot of gold-Close-med.jpg|[[Pot of Gold (Mars)|Pot of Gold rock]]\nImage:Gusev - Colina Husband.jpg|''Spirit'''s traverse up Husband Hill\nImage:Spirit PIA03230.jpg|''Spirit'' artificially added to image (taken by itself) of Larry's Lookout\nImage:MarsSunset.jpg|Martian sunset by ''Spirit'' at Gusev crater, May 19, 2005.\n</gallery>\n\n==== Dust devils ====\nOn March 9, 2005 (probably during the Martian night), the rover's solar panel efficiency jumped from the original ~60%  to 93%, followed on March 10, by the sighting of [[dust devils]]. NASA scientists speculate a dust devil must have swept the solar panels clean, possibly significantly extending the duration of the mission. This also marks the first time dust devils had been spotted by ''Spirit'' or ''Opportunity'', and is easily one of the top highlights of the mission to date. Dust devils had previously only been photographed by the ''[[Mars Pathfinder|Pathfinder]]'' probe.\n\nMission members monitoring ''Spirit'' on Mars reported on March 12, 2005 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2005|03|12}}), that a lucky encounter with a dust devil had cleaned the robot's solar panels. Energy levels dramatically increased and daily science work was anticipated to be expanded.<ref>{{cite web | last = David | first = Leonard | date = March 12, 2005 | url = http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/spirit_dust_050312.html | title = Spirit Gets A Dust Devil Once-Over | publisher = Space.com | accessdate =December 1, 2006}}</ref>\n \n[[File:Marsdustdevil2.gif|thumb|center|800px|Video of a dust devil on Mars, photographed by ''Spirit''.

Here it was found that Husband Hill has two summits, with one a little higher than the other. On August 21 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2005|08|20}})<ref>{{cite web |title=Rover Update: 2005: All |url=https://mars.nasa.gov/mer/mission/rover-status/spirit/2005/all/#sol579 |website=mars.nasa.gov |accessdate=23 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref>, ''Spirit'' reached the real summit of Husband Hill. The rover was the first spacecraft to climb atop a mountain on another planet. The whole distance driven totaled 4971 meters.\nThe summit itself was flat. ''Spirit'' took a 360 degree panorama in real color, which included the whole Gusev crater. At night the rover observed the moons [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]] in order to determine their orbits better.<ref name=\"nasa_2010_189\">{{cite web \n|authors=Staff |title=NASA Rover Finds Clue to Mars' Past And Environment for Life |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/news/mer20100603.html |work=[[NASA]] |date=2010-06-03 |accessdate=2011-05-25}}</ref> On sol 656 ''Spirit'' surveyed the Mars sky and the opacity of the atmosphere with its pancam to make a coordinated science campaign with the Hubble Space Telescope in Earth orbit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll_2005.html#sol655|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\nFrom the peak ''Spirit'' spotted a striking formation, which was dubbed \"Home Plate\". This was an interesting target, but ''Spirit'' would be driven later to the McCool Hill to tilt its solar panels towards the sun in the coming winter. At the end of October the rover was driven downhill and to Home Plate. On the way down ''Spirit'' reached the rock formation named \"Comanche\" on sol 690. Scientists used data from all three spectrometers to find out that about one-fourth of the composition of Comanche is magnesium iron carbonate. That concentration is 10 times higher than for any previously identified carbonate in a Martian rock. Carbonates originate in wet, near-neutral conditions but dissolve in acid. The find at Comanche is the first unambiguous evidence from the Mars Exploration Mission rovers for a past Martian environment that may have been more favorable to life than the wet but acidic conditions indicated by the rovers' earlier finds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/multimedia/gallery/comanche-no-label.html|title=NASA \u2013 Carbonate-Containing Martian Rocks (False Color)|website=www.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\n{{Wide image|Everest Panorama from Mars.jpg|1100px|View from the Summit taken by ''Spirit'' on August 23, 2005, as the rover completed the climb up Husband Hill.}}\n\n=== 2006 ===\n\n==== Driving to McCool Hill ====\nIn 2006 ''Spirit'' drove towards an area dubbed Home Plate, and reached it in February. For events in 2006 by NASA see [http://marsrover.nasa.gov/mission/status_spirit_2006.html NASA Spirit Archive 2006]\n\n''Spirit's'' next stop was originally planned to be the north face of [[McCool Hill]], where ''Spirit'' would receive adequate sunlight during the Martian winter. On March 16, 2006 JPL announced that ''Spirit's'' troublesome front wheel had stopped working altogether. Despite this, ''Spirit'' was still making progress toward McCool Hill because the control team programmed the rover to drive toward McCool Hill backwards, dragging its broken wheel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll.html#sol778|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref>  In late March, ''Spirit'' encountered loose soil that was impeding its progress toward McCool Hill. A decision was made to terminate attempts to reach McCool Hill and instead park on a nearby ridge named Low Ridge Haven.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right \n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Home plate anim.gif\n| width1    = {{#expr: (130 * 331 / 285 ) round 0}}\n| alt1      = \n| caption1  = Curious rock near edge of \"Home Plate\" with a jutting portion.

The rover made its first drive, a short turn to position targets of interest within reach of the robotic arm, in early November 2006, following the shortest days of winter and solar conjunction when communications with Earth were severely limited.\n\nWhile at Low Ridge, ''Spirit'' imaged two rocks of similar chemical nature to that of ''Opportunity'''s [[Heat Shield Rock]], a [[meteorite]] on the surface of Mars. Named \"Zhong Shan\" for [[Sun Yat-sen]] and \"Allan Hills\" for the [[Allan Hills|location]] in [[Antarctica]] where several Martian meteorites have been found, they stood out against the background rocks that were darker. Further spectrographic testing is being done to determine the exact composition of these rocks, which may turn out to also be meteorites.\n\n=== 2007 ===\n\n==== Software upgrade ====\nOn January 4, 2007 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2007|01|04}}), both rovers received new flight software to the onboard computers. The update was received just in time for the third anniversary of their landing. The new systems let the rovers decide whether or not to transmit an image, and whether or not to extend their arms to examine rocks, which would save much time for scientists as they would not have to sift through hundreds of images to find the one they want, or examine the surroundings to decide to extend the arms and examine the rocks.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2007/01/04/tech-mars.html | work=CBC News | title=Old rovers learn new tricks | date=January 4, 2007}}</ref>\n\n====Silica Valley====\n[[File:Spirit Mars Silica April 20 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Rover exposes silica-rich dust]]\n''Spirit'''s dead wheel turned out to have a silver lining. As it was traveling in March 2007, pulling the dead wheel behind, the wheel scraped off the upper layer of the Martian soil, uncovering a patch of ground that scientists say shows evidence of a past environment that would have been perfect for microbial life. It is similar to areas on Earth where water or steam from hot springs came into contact with volcanic rocks. On Earth, these are locations that tend to teem with bacteria, said rover chief scientist [[Steve Squyres]]. \"We're really excited about this,\" he told a meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU). The area is extremely rich in [[Silicon dioxide|silica]]\u2013the main ingredient of window glass. The researchers have now concluded that the bright material must have been produced in one of two ways. One: hot-spring deposits produced when water dissolved silica at one location and then carried it to another (i.e. a geyser). Two: acidic steam rising through cracks in rocks  stripped them of their mineral components, leaving silica behind. \"The important thing is that whether it is one hypothesis or the other, the implications for the former habitability of Mars are pretty much the same,\" Squyres explained to BBC News. Hot water provides an environment in which [[microbe]]s can thrive and the precipitation of that silica entombs and preserves them. Squyres added, \"You can go to [[hot spring]]s and you can go to [[fumarole]]s and at either place on Earth it is teeming with life \u2013 [[Microorganism|microbial life]].\"<ref name=\"Amos\">{{cite news  | last = Amos  | first = Jonathan    | title = Mars robot unearths microbe clue   | work = NASA says its robot rover Spirit has made one of its most significant discoveries on the surface of Mars. |publisher=BBC News  | date = December 11, 2007 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7137793.stm  | accessdate =December 12, 2007 }}</ref><ref name=\"20071210a\">{{cite web  | last = Bertster  | first =  Guy   | title = Mars Rover Investigates Signs of Steamy Martian Past  | work = Press Release  | publisher = Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California  | date = December 10, 2007  | url = http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20071210a.html  | accessdate =December 12, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==== Global dust storm and Home Plate ====\nDuring 2007 ''Spirit'' spent several months near the base of the Home Plate plateau. On sol 1306 ''Spirit'' climbed onto the eastern edge of the plateau. In September and October it examined rocks and soils at several locations on the southern half of the plateau. On November 6, ''Spirit'' had reached the western edge of Home Plate, and started taking pictures for a panoramic overview of the western valley, with Grissom Hill and Husband Hill visible.

The storms intensified and by July 20, both ''Spirit'' and ''Opportunity'' were facing the real possibility of system failure due to lack of energy. NASA released a statement to the press that said (in part) \"We're rooting for our rovers to survive these storms, but they were never designed for conditions this intense\".<ref>{{Cite press| url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2007-080| accessdate=August 21, 2009| title=NASA Mars Rovers Braving Severe Dust Storms| date=July 27, 2007| publisher=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]}}</ref> The key problem caused by the dust storms was a dramatic reduction in solar energy caused by there being so much dust in the atmosphere that it was blocking 99 percent of direct sunlight to ''Opportunity'', and slightly more to ''Spirit''.\n\nNormally the solar arrays on the rovers are able to generate up to {{Convert|700|Wh}} of energy per [[Martian day]]. After the storms, the amount of energy generated was greatly reduced to {{Convert|128|Wh}}. If the rovers generate less than {{Convert|150|Wh}} per day they must start draining their batteries to run survival heaters. If the batteries run dry, key electrical elements are likely to fail due to the intense cold. Both rovers were put into the lowest-power setting in order to wait out the storms. In early August the storms began to clear slightly, allowing the rovers to successfully charge their batteries. They were kept in hibernation in order to wait out the remainder of the storm.<ref>{{Cite press| url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20070807a.html| accessdate=August 21, 2009| title=Martian Skies Brighten Slightly| date=August 7, 2007| publisher=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]}}</ref>\n\n=== 2008 ===\n\n==== Hibernating ====\nThe main concern was the energy level for ''Spirit''. To increase the amount of light hitting the solar panels, the rover was parked in the northern part of Home Plate on as steep a slope as possible. It was expected that the level of dust cover on the solar panels would increase by 70 percent and that a slope of 30 degrees would be necessary to survive the winter. In February, a tilt of 29.9 degrees was achieved. Extra energy was available at times, and a high definition panorama named ''Bonestell'' was produced. At other times when there was only enough solar energy to recharge the batteries, communication with Earth was minimized and all unnecessary instruments were switched off. At winter solstice the energy production declined to 235 watt hours per sol.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll_2008.html|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\n==== Winter dust storm ====\nOn November 10, 2008, a large dust storm further reduced the output of the solar panels to {{Convert|89|Wh}} per day\u2014a critically low level.<ref>{{Cite press| url=http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20081110a.html |accessdate=August 21, 2009|title=Dust Storm Cuts Energy Supply of NASA Mars Rover Spirit| date= November 10, 2008| publisher=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]}}</ref> NASA officials were hopeful that ''Spirit'' would survive the storm, and that the energy level would rise once the storm had passed and the skies started clearing.

It is also possible that the rover had experienced a mission clock fault. If that had happened, the rover would have lost track of time and tried to remain asleep until enough sunlight struck the solar arrays to wake it. This state is called \"Solar Groovy.\" If the rover woke up from a mission clock fault, it would only listen. Starting on July 26, 2010 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2010|07|26}}), a new procedure to address the possible mission clock fault was implemented.\n\nEach sol, the Deep Space Network mission controllers sent a set of X-band \"Sweep & Beep\" commands. If the rover had experienced a mission clock fault and then had been awoken during the day, it would have listened during brief, 20-minute intervals during each hour awake. Due to the possible clock fault, the timing of these 20-minute listening intervals was not known, so multiple \"Sweep & Beep\" commands were sent. If the rover heard one of these commands, it would have responded with an X-band beep signal, updating the mission controllers on its status and allowing them to investigate the state of the rover further.

Sulfate was found, and it needs water to form. \nWishstone contained a great deal of plagioclase, some olivine, and [[anhydrate]] (a sulfate). Peace rocks showed [[sulfur]] and strong evidence for bound water, so hydrated sulfates are suspected. Watchtower class rocks lack olivine consequently they may have been altered by water. The Independence class showed some signs of clay (perhaps montmorillonite a member of the smectite group). Clays require fairly long term exposure to water to form.\nOne type of soil, called Paso Robles, from the Columbia Hills, may be an evaporate deposit because it contains large amounts of sulfur, [[phosphorus]], [[calcium]], and iron.<ref name=\"Ming2005JE002560\" />\nAlso, MB found that much of the iron in Paso Robles soil was of the oxidized, Fe<sup>3+</sup> form, which would happen if water had been present.<ref name=\"Bell\" />\n\nTowards the middle of the six-year mission (a mission that was supposed to last only 90 days), large amounts of pure [[silica]] were found in the soil.<ref name=\"Sky & Telescope\">{{cite web|url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/19177609.html|title=Mars Rover Uncovers Ancient Hot Springs|publisher=SkyandTelescope.com|date=2008-05-22|accessdate=2012-08-01}}</ref>  The silica could have come from the interaction of soil with acid vapors produced by volcanic activity in the presence of water or from water in a hot spring environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/mer-20070521.html|title=NASA \u2013 Mars Rover Spirit Unearths Surprise Evidence of Wetter Past|website=www.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\nAfter ''Spirit'' stopped working scientists studied old data from the Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer, or [[Mini-TES]] and confirmed the presence of large amounts of [[carbonate]]-rich rocks, which means that regions of the planet may have once harbored water.

However, in the Columbia Hills there was clear evidence for a moderate amount of aqueous weathering. The evidence included sulfates and the minerals goethite and carbonates that only form in the presence of water. It is believed that Gusev crater may have held a lake long ago, but it has since been covered by igneous materials. All the dust contains a magnetic component that was identified as magnetite with some titanium. Furthermore, the thin coating of dust that covers everything on Mars is the same in all parts of Mars.\n\n==Astronomy==\n{{see also|Astronomy on Mars}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = PIA05547-Spirit Rover-Earth seen from Mars.png\n| width1 = {{#expr: (200 * (1194 / 1007)) round 0}}\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = [[Earth]] from Mars\n| image2 = Phobos & Deimos full thumb.png\n| width2 = {{#expr: (200 * (200 / 213)) round 0}}\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = Night sky of Mars showing [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]] (left) and [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] (right) in front of [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], as seen by [[Mars Exploration Rover]] ''Spirit'' on August 26, 2005.

It also took the first photo of Earth from the surface of another planet in early March 2004.\n\nIn late 2005, ''Spirit'' took advantage of a favorable energy situation to make multiple nighttime observations of both of Mars' moons [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]].<ref name=\"pancam\">Jim Bell (Cornell University) et al.

Some of ''Spirit'''s star gazing was designed to look for a predicted [[meteor shower]] caused by [[Halley's Comet]], and although at least four imaged streaks were suspect meteors, they could not be unambiguously differentiated from those caused by cosmic rays.<ref name=\"pancam\" />\n\nA [[transit of Mercury from Mars]] took place on January 12, 2005 from about 14:45 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] to 23:05 UTC. Theoretically, this could have been observed by both ''Spirit'' and ''[[Opportunity rover|Opportunity]]''; however, camera resolution did not permit seeing Mercury's [[Arc second|6.1\"]] angular diameter. They were able to observe transits of [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]] across the Sun, but at [[Arc minute|2']] angular diameter, Deimos is about 20 times larger than Mercury's 6.1\" angular diameter. Ephemeris data generated by [[JPL Horizons]] indicates that ''Opportunity'' would have been able to observe the transit from the start until local sunset at about 19:23 UTC Earth time, while ''Spirit'' would have been able to observe it from local sunrise at about 19:38 UTC until the end of the transit.{{Clarify|date=October 2008}}<!-- the nasa.gov URL does not state any of this; need instructions on how to verify this --><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?horizons|title=HORIZONS System|first=Alan|last=Chamberlin|website=ssd.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\n==Equipment wear and failures==\nBoth rovers passed their original mission time of 90 sols many times over.

Engineers began driving the rover backwards, dragging the dead wheel. Although this resulted in changes to driving techniques, the dragging effect became a useful tool, partially clearing away soil on the surface as the rover traveled, thus allowing areas to be imaged that would normally be inaccessible. However, in mid-December 2009, to the surprise of the engineers, the right front wheel showed slight movement in a wheel-test on sol 2113 and clearly rotated with normal resistance on three of four wheel-tests on sol 2117, but stalled on the fourth. On November 29, 2009 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2009|11|29}}), the right rear wheel also stalled and remained inoperable for the remainder of the mission.\n\nScientific instruments also experienced degradation as a result of exposure to the harsh Martian environment and use over a far longer period than had been anticipated by the mission planners. Over time, the diamond in the resin grinding surface of the [[Rock Abrasion Tool]] wore down, after that the device could only be used to brush targets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/rover/Roverextension.html|title=NASA\u02bcs Mars rovers and Steve Squyres keep going and going \u2013 Cornell Chronicle|website=www.news.cornell.edu}}</ref> All of the other science instruments and engineering cameras continued to function until contact was lost; however, towards the end of ''Spirit'''s life, the [[MIMOS II]] [[M\u00f6ssbauer spectrometer]] took much longer to produce results than it did earlier in the mission because of the decay of its [[cobalt]]-57 gamma ray source that has a half life of 271 days.\n\n==Honors==\n[[File:MarsSunsetCut.jpg|thumb|right|Martian sunset in 2005 by ''Spirit'']]\n\n===To rover===\nTo commemorate ''Spirit'''s great contribution to the [[exploration of Mars]], the [[asteroid]]  [[37452 Spirit]] has been named after it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/spotlight/20041011.html|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: Spotlight|website=marsrovers.nasa.gov}}</ref> The name was proposed by [[Ingrid van Houten-Groeneveld]] who along with [[Cornelis Johannes van Houten]] and [[Tom Gehrels]] discovered the asteroid on September 24, 1960.\n\n[[Reuben H.

It is the Earth's orbital motion about the Sun which causes this apparent motion to occur. The Earth's axis of rotation is not set perpendicular to this plane but at a present angle of 23.5 degrees to the perpendicular. The alignment of the axis is maintained throughout the year so that the point of sky above the north or south poles remains unchanged throughout the Earth's annual rotation around  the Sun.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/hqlibrary/aerospacedictionary/aerodictall/p.html#precession%20of%20the%20equinoxes|title=Aerospace Science and Technonlogy Dictionary P Section|website=www.hq.nasa.gov|access-date=2019-02-09}}</ref><br />\n\nA slow conical motion of the Earth's polar axis about its normal to the plane of the ecliptic is caused by the attractive force of the other heavenly bodies on the equatorial protuberance of the Earth.

Internal tensions led to the band's break up in 1987 and subsequent offers to reunite have been refused.<ref name=\"billboard\" /> In 2012, all four of their studio albums (and a compilation) appeared on ''[[Rolling Stone|Rolling Stone's]]'' list of the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]. \n\nBased on the songwriting partnership of Morrissey and Marr, the Smiths' focus on a guitar, bass, and drum sound, and fusion of 1960s rock and [[post-punk]], were a rejection of the [[synthesiser]]-based [[dance-pop]] of the time. Marr's [[Rickenbacker]] guitar work was reminiscent of the [[jangle pop]] sound of [[Roger McGuinn]] from [[the Byrds]].<ref name=\"Marr_Byrds\">{{cite web|last=Rosen|first=Steven|title=Johnny Marr on Fender Signature Guitar: 'It Was Such A Privilege'|work=UltimateGuitar.com (interview)|accessdate=5 May 2014|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506000635/http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/interviews/interviews/johnny_marr_on_fender_signature_guitar_it_was_such_a_privilege.html}}</ref> Morrissey's complex, literate lyrics combined themes of ordinary lives with mordant humour.\n\nThe Smiths were signed to the independent label [[Rough Trade Records]]. Several Smiths singles reached the top 20 of the [[UK Singles Chart]] and all of their studio albums reached the top five of the [[UK Albums Chart]], including the number-one album ''[[Meat Is Murder]]'' (1985).

Morrissey provided the lyrics for \"Don't Blow Your Own Horn\", the first song that they worked on; however, they decided against retaining the song, with Marr commenting that \"neither of us liked it very much\".{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=17}} The next song that they worked on was \"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle\", which again was based on lyrics produced by Morrissey. Marr included a tempo which was based on the [[Patti Smith]] song \"Kimberly\", and they recorded it on Marr's TEAC three-track cassette recorder. The third track that the duo worked on was \"[[Suffer Little Children]]\".{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=18}} Alongside these original compositions, Morrissey suggested that the band produce a cover of \"I Want a Boy for My Birthday\", a song by the 1960s American girl band [[the Cookies]]; although he had never heard of the song before, Marr agreed, enjoying the subversive element of having a male vocalist sing it, and the song was recorded on his TEAC machine.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=22}}\n\nBy the end of the summer of 1982 Morrissey had chosen the band name \"the Smiths\",{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1p=34|2a1=Goddard|2y=2006|2p=20}} later informing an interviewer that \"it was the most ordinary name and I thought it was time that the ordinary folk of the world showed their faces\".{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=20}} Around the time of the band's formation, Morrissey decided that he would be publicly known only by his surname,{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1p=34|2a1=Simpson|2y=2004|2p=42}} with Marr referring to him as \"Mozzer\" or \"Moz\".{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=21}} In 1983 he forbade those around him from using the name \"Steven\", which he despised.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=21}}\n\nAfter remaining with the band for several rehearsals, Pomfret departed acrimoniously.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=19}} He was replaced by the bass player Dale Hibbert, who worked at Manchester's Decibel Studios, where Marr had met him while recording Freak Party's demo.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=20}} It was through Hibbert that the Smiths were able to record their first demo at Decibel, doing so one night in August 1982.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=23}} Aided by drummer [[Simon Wolstencroft]], whom Marr had worked with in Freak Party, the band recorded both \"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle\" and \"Suffer Little Children\".{{sfn|Goddard|2003|pp=23\u201324}} Wolstencroft was not interested in joining the band, so auditions were held to find a permanent drummer, which resulted in [[Mike Joyce (musician)|Mike Joyce]] joining them; he later revealed that he was under the influence of [[magic mushrooms]] during his audition performance.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|pp=25\u201326}} Meanwhile, Morrissey took the demo recording to [[Factory Records]], but Factory's [[Tony Wilson]] wasn't interested.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|pp=26\u201327}}\n\nIn October 1982 the Smiths gave their first public performance as a support act for [[Blue Rondo \u00e0 la Turk (band)|Blue Rondo \u00e0 la Turk]] during a student music and fashion show, \"An Evening of Pure Pleasure\", at Manchester's [[The Ritz (Manchester)|The Ritz]] venue.{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1pp=34, 35|2a1=Goddard|2y=2006|2p=27}} During the performance, they played both their own compositions and \"I Want a Boy for My Birthday\".{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=28}} Morrissey had organised the gig's aesthetic; the band came onstage to [[Klaus Nomi]]'s version of [[Henry Purcell]]'s \"The Cold Song\" playing through the venue's sound system before his friend James Maker stepped onstage to introduce the band.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|pp=27\u201329}} Maker remained onstage during the performance, relating that \"I was given a pair of maracas \u2013 an optional extra \u2013 and carte blanche.

I was there to drink red wine, make extraneous hand gestures and keep well within the tight, chalked circle that Morrissey had drawn around me.\"{{sfn|Goddard|2006|pp=28\u201329}} Hibbert however was unhappy with what he perceived as the band's gay aesthetic; in turn, Morrissey and Marr were unhappy with his bass playing, so he was removed from the band and replaced by Marr's old school friend [[Andy Rourke]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1p=36|2a1=Goddard|2y=2006|2pp=27\u201330}} Hibbert however denies that he had any issue with the band being perceived as a 'gay' band, and was unsure as to the reasons why he was asked to leave the band.<ref>{{cite book| last= Hibbert| first= D |year= 2015| title= Boy Interrupted.

Present at the gig was [[John Walters (broadcaster)|John Walters]], the producer of [[John Peel]]'s [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] show; interested, he invited the band to record a session for the program. Peel expressed the view that \"I was impressed because unlike most bands... you couldn't immediately tell what records they'd been listening to. That's fairly unusual, very rare indeed... It was that aspect of the Smiths that I found most impressive.\"{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=43}} Following this radio exposure, the band gained their first interviews, in music magazines ''[[NME]]'' and ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]''.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=43}}\n\nThe Smiths then agreed to sign a record contract with Rough Trade, with Travis travelling up to Manchester to meet the band at their Crazy Face rehearsal space; there they signed the contract.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|pp=46\u201347}} Only Morrissey and Marr signed it on behalf of the band, and there was no discussion at the time regarding how the band's earnings would be divided up, something that would lead to the eventual argument over royalties which resulted in the 1996 High Court case.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=47}} To produce the band's first album, Travis brought in [[Troy Tate]] of [[the Teardrop Explodes]], and under Tate's supervision the band recorded their first album, provisionally titled ''The Hand That Rocks the Cradle'', at the Elephant Studios in [[Wapping]], [[East London]].{{sfn|Goddard|2006|pp=47\u201350}} Rough Trade were unhappy with the album that the band produced and Troy's production of it, ordering the band to redo it with a new producer, [[John Porter (musician)|John Porter]].{{sfn|Goddard|2006|pp=50\u201351}}\n\nThe band soon generated controversy when [[Gary Bushell]] of ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' tabloid alleged that their B-side \"Handsome Devil\" was an endorsement of [[paedophilia]].{{sfnm|1a1=Simpson|1y=2004|1p=108|2a1=Goddard|2y=2006|2pp=35\u201336}} The band denied this, with Morrissey stating that the song \"has nothing to do with children, and certainly nothing to do with child molesting\".{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=37}}\n\nThe follow-up singles \"[[This Charming Man]]\" and \"[[What Difference Does It Make?]]\" fared better when they reached numbers 25 and 12 respectively on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=\"guinness book\">{{Cite book|last=Roberts|first=David (ed.)|title=British Hit Singles & Albums|publisher=[[HIT Entertainment]]|year=2006|edition=19th|pages=509\u2013510|isbn=1-904994-10-5|title-link=Guinness Book of British Hit Singles & Albums}}</ref> Aided by praise from the music press and a series of studio sessions for Peel and [[David Jensen]] at [[BBC Radio 1]], the Smiths began to acquire a dedicated fan base.\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=\"The Smiths brought realism to their romance, and tempered their angst with the lightest of touches.

This caused an uproar after the grandfather of one of the murdered children heard the song on a [[Public house|pub]] [[jukebox]] and felt the band was trying to commercialise the murders. After meeting with Morrissey, he accepted that the song was a sincere exploration of the impact of the murders. Morrissey subsequently established a friendship with Ann West, the mother of victim Lesley Ann Downey, who is mentioned by name in the song.<ref>See the discussion of [http://foreverill.com/disc/heaven.htm \"Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926031909/http://foreverill.com/disc/heaven.htm |date=26 September 2008 }} at ''Forever Ill''; and the [http://www.passionsjustlikemine.com/lyrics/smiths-slc.htm \"Suffer Little Children\"] lyrics at ''Passions Just Like Mine''.

This collected singles, B-sides and the versions of songs that had been recorded throughout the previous year for the Peel and Jensen shows.\n\n===''Meat Is Murder''===\nEarly in 1985 the band released their second album, ''[[Meat Is Murder]]''. This album was more strident and political than its predecessor, including the pro-vegetarian title track (Morrissey forbade the rest of the group from being photographed eating meat), the light-hearted republicanism of \"Nowhere Fast\", and the anti-[[corporal punishment]] \"The Headmaster Ritual\" and \"Barbarism Begins at Home\". The band had also grown more diverse musically, with Marr adding rockabilly riffs to \"Rusholme Ruffians\" and Rourke playing a funk bass solo on \"Barbarism Begins at Home\". The album was preceded by the re-release of the B-side \"[[How Soon Is Now?]]\" as a single, and although that song was not on the original [[Phonograph record|LP]], it has been added to subsequent releases. ''Meat Is Murder'' was the band's only album (barring compilations) to reach number one in the UK charts.<ref name=album/> In 2003, the album was ranked number 295 on ''Rolling Stone'' magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 500 albums of all time|url=http://www.archer2000.net/sbs/awardsrs500.html|accessdate=26 April 2013|publisher=Rolling Stone LLC/Archer & Valerie Productions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102200719/http://www.archer2000.net/sbs/awardsrs500.html|archive-date=2 January 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nMorrissey brought a political stance to many of his interviews, courting further controversy. Among his targets were the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher government]], the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarchy]], and the famine relief project [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]]. Morrissey famously quipped of the last, \"One can have great concern for the people of [[Ethiopia]], but it's another thing to inflict daily torture on the people of England\"<ref>{{cite web| date=18 November 2004 | title=Band Aid vs. Morrissey&nbsp;... | format=http | work=Overyourhead.co.uk | url=http://www.overyourhead.co.uk/2004/11/band-aid-vs.html | accessdate =22 April 2007}}</ref> (\"torture\" being a reference to the music that resulted from the project). The subsequent single-only release \"[[Shakespeare's Sister (song)|Shakespeare's Sister]]\" reached number 26 on the UK Singles Chart, although the only single taken from the album, \"[[That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore]]\", was less successful, barely making the top 50.<ref name=single>{{cite web|url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/artist/_/smiths/#singles|title=The Smiths Uk Charts|website=Theofficialcharts.com|accessdate=20 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n===''The Queen Is Dead''===\nDuring 1985, the band completed lengthy tours of the UK and the US while recording their next studio record, ''[[The Queen Is Dead]]'' a meta (\"Frankly, Mr. Shankly\" and \"The Boy With the Thorn in His Side\"), merry (\"Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others\", \"Vicar in a Tutu\", \"Cemetery Gates\"), and melancholic album (\"I Know It's Over\" and \"There Is a Light that Never Goes Out\").<ref name=\"The Smiths: The Queen Is Dead\">{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-smiths-the-queen-is-dead/|title=The Smiths: The Queen Is Dead|website=Pitchfork|language=en|access-date=12 March 2019}}</ref> The album was released in June 1986, shortly after the single \"[[Bigmouth Strikes Again]]\".

A legal dispute with Rough Trade had delayed the album by almost seven months (it had been completed in November 1985), and Marr was beginning to feel the stress of the band's exhausting touring and recording schedule. He later told ''NME'', \"'Worse for wear' wasn't the half of it: I was extremely ill. By the time the tour actually finished it was all getting a little bit&nbsp;... dangerous.

Consisting of vocalist [[Morrissey]], guitarist [[Johnny Marr]], bassist [[Andy Rourke]], and drummer [[Mike Joyce (musician)|Mike Joyce]], critics consider the Smiths one of the most important bands to emerge from the British [[independent music]] scene of the 1980s. Internal tensions led to the band's break up in 1987 and subsequent offers to reunite have been refused.<ref name=\"billboard\" /> In 2012, all four of their studio albums (and a compilation) appeared on ''[[Rolling Stone|Rolling Stone's]]'' list of the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]. \n\nBased on the songwriting partnership of Morrissey and Marr, the Smiths' focus on a guitar, bass, and drum sound, and fusion of 1960s rock and [[post-punk]], were a rejection of the [[synthesiser]]-based [[dance-pop]] of the time. Marr's [[Rickenbacker]] guitar work was reminiscent of the [[jangle pop]] sound of [[Roger McGuinn]] from [[the Byrds]].<ref name=\"Marr_Byrds\">{{cite web|last=Rosen|first=Steven|title=Johnny Marr on Fender Signature Guitar: 'It Was Such A Privilege'|work=UltimateGuitar.com (interview)|accessdate=5 May 2014|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506000635/http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/interviews/interviews/johnny_marr_on_fender_signature_guitar_it_was_such_a_privilege.html}}</ref> Morrissey's complex, literate lyrics combined themes of ordinary lives with mordant humour.\n\nThe Smiths were signed to the independent label [[Rough Trade Records]]. Several Smiths singles reached the top 20 of the [[UK Singles Chart]] and all of their studio albums reached the top five of the [[UK Albums Chart]], including the number-one album ''[[Meat Is Murder]]'' (1985).

Morrissey provided the lyrics for \"Don't Blow Your Own Horn\", the first song that they worked on; however, they decided against retaining the song, with Marr commenting that \"neither of us liked it very much\".{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=17}} The next song that they worked on was \"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle\", which again was based on lyrics produced by Morrissey. Marr included a tempo which was based on the [[Patti Smith]] song \"Kimberly\", and they recorded it on Marr's TEAC three-track cassette recorder. The third track that the duo worked on was \"[[Suffer Little Children]]\".{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=18}} Alongside these original compositions, Morrissey suggested that the band produce a cover of \"I Want a Boy for My Birthday\", a song by the 1960s American girl band [[the Cookies]]; although he had never heard of the song before, Marr agreed, enjoying the subversive element of having a male vocalist sing it, and the song was recorded on his TEAC machine.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=22}}\n\nBy the end of the summer of 1982 Morrissey had chosen the band name \"the Smiths\",{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1p=34|2a1=Goddard|2y=2006|2p=20}} later informing an interviewer that \"it was the most ordinary name and I thought it was time that the ordinary folk of the world showed their faces\".{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=20}} Around the time of the band's formation, Morrissey decided that he would be publicly known only by his surname,{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1p=34|2a1=Simpson|2y=2004|2p=42}} with Marr referring to him as \"Mozzer\" or \"Moz\".{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=21}} In 1983 he forbade those around him from using the name \"Steven\", which he despised.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=21}}\n\nAfter remaining with the band for several rehearsals, Pomfret departed acrimoniously.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=19}} He was replaced by the bass player Dale Hibbert, who worked at Manchester's Decibel Studios, where Marr had met him while recording Freak Party's demo.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=20}} It was through Hibbert that the Smiths were able to record their first demo at Decibel, doing so one night in August 1982.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=23}} Aided by drummer [[Simon Wolstencroft]], whom Marr had worked with in Freak Party, the band recorded both \"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle\" and \"Suffer Little Children\".{{sfn|Goddard|2003|pp=23\u201324}} Wolstencroft was not interested in joining the band, so auditions were held to find a permanent drummer, which resulted in [[Mike Joyce (musician)|Mike Joyce]] joining them; he later revealed that he was under the influence of [[magic mushrooms]] during his audition performance.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|pp=25\u201326}} Meanwhile, Morrissey took the demo recording to [[Factory Records]], but Factory's [[Tony Wilson]] wasn't interested.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|pp=26\u201327}}\n\nIn October 1982 the Smiths gave their first public performance as a support act for [[Blue Rondo \u00e0 la Turk (band)|Blue Rondo \u00e0 la Turk]] during a student music and fashion show, \"An Evening of Pure Pleasure\", at Manchester's [[The Ritz (Manchester)|The Ritz]] venue.{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1pp=34, 35|2a1=Goddard|2y=2006|2p=27}} During the performance, they played both their own compositions and \"I Want a Boy for My Birthday\".{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=28}} Morrissey had organised the gig's aesthetic; the band came onstage to [[Klaus Nomi]]'s version of [[Henry Purcell]]'s \"The Cold Song\" playing through the venue's sound system before his friend James Maker stepped onstage to introduce the band.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|pp=27\u201329}} Maker remained onstage during the performance, relating that \"I was given a pair of maracas \u2013 an optional extra \u2013 and carte blanche.

I was there to drink red wine, make extraneous hand gestures and keep well within the tight, chalked circle that Morrissey had drawn around me.\"{{sfn|Goddard|2006|pp=28\u201329}} Hibbert however was unhappy with what he perceived as the band's gay aesthetic; in turn, Morrissey and Marr were unhappy with his bass playing, so he was removed from the band and replaced by Marr's old school friend [[Andy Rourke]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1p=36|2a1=Goddard|2y=2006|2pp=27\u201330}} Hibbert however denies that he had any issue with the band being perceived as a 'gay' band, and was unsure as to the reasons why he was asked to leave the band.<ref>{{cite book| last= Hibbert| first= D |year= 2015| title= Boy Interrupted.

Present at the gig was [[John Walters (broadcaster)|John Walters]], the producer of [[John Peel]]'s [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] show; interested, he invited the band to record a session for the program. Peel expressed the view that \"I was impressed because unlike most bands... you couldn't immediately tell what records they'd been listening to. That's fairly unusual, very rare indeed... It was that aspect of the Smiths that I found most impressive.\"{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=43}} Following this radio exposure, the band gained their first interviews, in music magazines ''[[NME]]'' and ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]''.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=43}}\n\nThe Smiths then agreed to sign a record contract with Rough Trade, with Travis travelling up to Manchester to meet the band at their Crazy Face rehearsal space; there they signed the contract.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|pp=46\u201347}} Only Morrissey and Marr signed it on behalf of the band, and there was no discussion at the time regarding how the band's earnings would be divided up, something that would lead to the eventual argument over royalties which resulted in the 1996 High Court case.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=47}} To produce the band's first album, Travis brought in [[Troy Tate]] of [[the Teardrop Explodes]], and under Tate's supervision the band recorded their first album, provisionally titled ''The Hand That Rocks the Cradle'', at the Elephant Studios in [[Wapping]], [[East London]].{{sfn|Goddard|2006|pp=47\u201350}} Rough Trade were unhappy with the album that the band produced and Troy's production of it, ordering the band to redo it with a new producer, [[John Porter (musician)|John Porter]].{{sfn|Goddard|2006|pp=50\u201351}}\n\nThe band soon generated controversy when [[Gary Bushell]] of ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' tabloid alleged that their B-side \"Handsome Devil\" was an endorsement of [[paedophilia]].{{sfnm|1a1=Simpson|1y=2004|1p=108|2a1=Goddard|2y=2006|2pp=35\u201336}} The band denied this, with Morrissey stating that the song \"has nothing to do with children, and certainly nothing to do with child molesting\".{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=37}}\n\nThe follow-up singles \"[[This Charming Man]]\" and \"[[What Difference Does It Make?]]\" fared better when they reached numbers 25 and 12 respectively on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=\"guinness book\">{{Cite book|last=Roberts|first=David (ed.)|title=British Hit Singles & Albums|publisher=[[HIT Entertainment]]|year=2006|edition=19th|pages=509\u2013510|isbn=1-904994-10-5|title-link=Guinness Book of British Hit Singles & Albums}}</ref> Aided by praise from the music press and a series of studio sessions for Peel and [[David Jensen]] at [[BBC Radio 1]], the Smiths began to acquire a dedicated fan base.\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=\"The Smiths brought realism to their romance, and tempered their angst with the lightest of touches.

This caused an uproar after the grandfather of one of the murdered children heard the song on a [[Public house|pub]] [[jukebox]] and felt the band was trying to commercialise the murders. After meeting with Morrissey, he accepted that the song was a sincere exploration of the impact of the murders. Morrissey subsequently established a friendship with Ann West, the mother of victim Lesley Ann Downey, who is mentioned by name in the song.<ref>See the discussion of [http://foreverill.com/disc/heaven.htm \"Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926031909/http://foreverill.com/disc/heaven.htm |date=26 September 2008 }} at ''Forever Ill''; and the [http://www.passionsjustlikemine.com/lyrics/smiths-slc.htm \"Suffer Little Children\"] lyrics at ''Passions Just Like Mine''.

This collected singles, B-sides and the versions of songs that had been recorded throughout the previous year for the Peel and Jensen shows.\n\n===''Meat Is Murder''===\nEarly in 1985 the band released their second album, ''[[Meat Is Murder]]''. This album was more strident and political than its predecessor, including the pro-vegetarian title track (Morrissey forbade the rest of the group from being photographed eating meat), the light-hearted republicanism of \"Nowhere Fast\", and the anti-[[corporal punishment]] \"The Headmaster Ritual\" and \"Barbarism Begins at Home\". The band had also grown more diverse musically, with Marr adding rockabilly riffs to \"Rusholme Ruffians\" and Rourke playing a funk bass solo on \"Barbarism Begins at Home\". The album was preceded by the re-release of the B-side \"[[How Soon Is Now?]]\" as a single, and although that song was not on the original [[Phonograph record|LP]], it has been added to subsequent releases. ''Meat Is Murder'' was the band's only album (barring compilations) to reach number one in the UK charts.<ref name=album/> In 2003, the album was ranked number 295 on ''Rolling Stone'' magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 500 albums of all time|url=http://www.archer2000.net/sbs/awardsrs500.html|accessdate=26 April 2013|publisher=Rolling Stone LLC/Archer & Valerie Productions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102200719/http://www.archer2000.net/sbs/awardsrs500.html|archive-date=2 January 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nMorrissey brought a political stance to many of his interviews, courting further controversy. Among his targets were the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher government]], the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarchy]], and the famine relief project [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]].

He lives with his brother ([[Sachin Khedekar]]), his sister-in-law ([[Savita Prabhune]]), and their child. He is a violent man, but often performs apparently good deeds, such as beating up sexual harassers.\n\nRadhe falls in love with Nirjara Bhardwaj ([[Bhumika Chawla]]), a student at his former college and the daughter of a poor temple priest. Radhe helps her a few times, and she seems to like him. One day, Radhe proposes to her, and jokingly remarks that he would beat up her father if he doesn't agree to their marriage. Nirjara is too shocked to say much, and utters \"Yes\" when Radhe asks her if she was listening to him. Radhe interprets this as her acceptance of the proposal. Later, he and his friends intimidate Nirjara's fianc\u00e9 Rameshwar ([[Ravi Kishan]]). Next day, Radhe brings her a gift, but she tells him that she does not love him, and calls him a goon. A heartbroken Radhe subsequently tries to talk to her, but she refuses to engage in a conversation.\n\nRadhe's friends suggest that he give up rowdyism and violence to impress Nirjara, but one day, he roughs up a brothel owner who had beaten up one of his friends. As Radhe is about to punch the brother owner, Nirjara arrives at the scene, and Radhe stops the violence, allowing the brothel owner to escape.  Subsequently, Nirjara's elder sister Mamata, who is in need of money, is nearly tricked into prostitution, when she visits the brothel to meet a man who promises her a loan. Radhe, who does not know that she is Nirjara's sister, visits the same brothel to find a man who had harassed a woman. He saves Mamata from being arrested during a police raid. She tells him that her husband Aatmaram has evicted her, and is demanding money to give her the custody of their son. Next day, Radhe beats up Aatmaram, forcing him to take her back and to stop harassing her. Rameshwar sees this, and tells Nirjara that Radhe is a good, selfless man, who truly loves her. Unaware of this conversation, Radhe abducts Nirjara so that she would listen to him express his feelings for her. Nirjara initially feels intimidated, but ultimately falls in love with him.\n\nSubsequently, the brothel owner and his goons attack Radhe. Radhe suffers brain damage during the attack, and loses his mental balance. His family admits him to a religious institution for mental patients, as Nirjara and his friends pray for him. At one point, Radhe's mental state returns to normal, but the wardens do not understand this, and beat him up. Nirjara visits the institution and sees him in a pitiful condition while he is sleeping. Convinced that Radhe is not going to get well, Radhe's brother asks her to forget him and marry Rameshwar. On the day of Nirjara's wedding with Rameshwar, Radhe escapes from the institution, and arrives at her home, only to find that she has committed suicide. Radhe then allows himself to be taken back to the institution despite his family and friends trying to persuade him otherwise. The epilogue shows Radhe, now old and still in the institution, tying peacock feathers in Nirjara's memory.\n\n==Cast==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Actor\n!

He lives with his brother ([[Sachin Khedekar]]), his sister-in-law ([[Savita Prabhune]]), and their child. He is a violent man, but often performs apparently good deeds, such as beating up sexual harassers.\n\nRadhe falls in love with Nirjara Bhardwaj ([[Bhumika Chawla]]), a student at his former college and the daughter of a poor temple priest. Radhe helps her a few times, and she seems to like him. One day, Radhe proposes to her, and jokingly remarks that he would beat up her father if he doesn't agree to their marriage. Nirjara is too shocked to say much, and utters \"Yes\" when Radhe asks her if she was listening to him. Radhe interprets this as her acceptance of the proposal. Later, he and his friends intimidate Nirjara's fianc\u00e9 Rameshwar ([[Ravi Kishan]]). Next day, Radhe brings her a gift, but she tells him that she does not love him, and calls him a goon. A heartbroken Radhe subsequently tries to talk to her, but she refuses to engage in a conversation.\n\nRadhe's friends suggest that he give up rowdyism and violence to impress Nirjara, but one day, he roughs up a brothel owner who had beaten up one of his friends. As Radhe is about to punch the brother owner, Nirjara arrives at the scene, and Radhe stops the violence, allowing the brothel owner to escape.  Subsequently, Nirjara's elder sister Mamata, who is in need of money, is nearly tricked into prostitution, when she visits the brothel to meet a man who promises her a loan. Radhe, who does not know that she is Nirjara's sister, visits the same brothel to find a man who had harassed a woman. He saves Mamata from being arrested during a police raid. She tells him that her husband Aatmaram has evicted her, and is demanding money to give her the custody of their son. Next day, Radhe beats up Aatmaram, forcing him to take her back and to stop harassing her. Rameshwar sees this, and tells Nirjara that Radhe is a good, selfless man, who truly loves her. Unaware of this conversation, Radhe abducts Nirjara so that she would listen to him express his feelings for her. Nirjara initially feels intimidated, but ultimately falls in love with him.\n\nSubsequently, the brothel owner and his goons attack Radhe. Radhe suffers brain damage during the attack, and loses his mental balance. His family admits him to a religious institution for mental patients, as Nirjara and his friends pray for him. At one point, Radhe's mental state returns to normal, but the wardens do not understand this, and beat him up. Nirjara visits the institution and sees him in a pitiful condition while he is sleeping. Convinced that Radhe is not going to get well, Radhe's brother asks her to forget him and marry Rameshwar. On the day of Nirjara's wedding with Rameshwar, Radhe escapes from the institution, and arrives at her home, only to find that she has committed suicide. Radhe then allows himself to be taken back to the institution despite his family and friends trying to persuade him otherwise. The epilogue shows Radhe, now old and still in the institution, tying peacock feathers in Nirjara's memory.\n\n==Cast==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Actor\n!
