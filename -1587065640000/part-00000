It is the main urban centre of western Thuringia and bordering northeastern [[Hesse|Hessian]] regions, situated near the former [[Inner German border]]. A major attraction is [[Wartburg]] castle, which has been a [[UNESCO world heritage]] site since 1999.\n\nEisenach was an early capital of Thuringia in the 12th and 13th centuries. St.{{nbsp}}[[Elizabeth of Hungary|Elizabeth]] lived at the court of the [[Ludowingians]] here between 1211 and 1228. Later, [[Martin Luther]] came to Eisenach and translated the [[Luther Bible|Bible]] into German. In 1685, [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] was born here. During the [[early modern period]], Eisenach was a residence of the Ernestine [[House of Wettin|Wettins]] and was visited by numerous representatives of [[Weimar classicism]] like [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]].<ref name=\"Klauss\"/>{{rp|22\u201325}} In 1869, the [[Social Democratic Workers' Party of Germany|SDAP]], one of the two precursors of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) was founded in Eisenach.\n\nCar production is an important industry in Eisenach. The ''[[Automobilwerk Eisenach]]'' was founded in 1896. In the [[German Democratic Republic]], the [[Wartburg (car)|Wartburg]] was produced here.\n\nEisenach is situated on the [[H\u00f6rsel]] river, a tributary of the [[Werra]] between the [[Thuringian Forest]] in the south, the [[Hainich]] mountains in the north-east and the [[East Hesse Highlands]] in the north-west.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Nikolaikirche and Nikoliator.jpg|thumb|left|Nikolaikirche (left) and Nikolaitor (right)]]\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nEisenach's origin and early history is unknown. An 8th century Frankish settlement near Petersberg hill is regarded as the nucleus of Eisenach. However, there are no written sources about that early period. According to legend, [[Louis the Springer]] began in 1067 to establish [[Wartburg]] castle above the settlement.<ref name=\"Baedeker\"/>{{rp|139}}\n\nIn 1080, the castle was first mentioned in a Saxon chronicle. Eisenach itself followed in a document dating to 1150 where it was referred to as \"Isinacha\".<ref name=\"Baedeker\"/>{{rp|139}} During the 1180s, the town was established by the construction of three independent market settlements around the Saturday's market (today's Karlsplatz), the Wednesday's market (today's Frauenplan) and the Monday's market (today's Marktplatz). Due to its convenient location at a bottleneck between the [[Thuringian Forest]] in the south and the [[Hainich]] mountains in the north, Eisenach benefitted from substantial west-east trade along [[Via Regia]] from [[Frankfurt]] to [[Erfurt]] and [[Leipzig]] and became a rich merchant town. During the second half of the 12th century, the town walls were erected (the Nikolaitor is an important relict of this wall) and Eisenach got a planned grid of streets and alleys. In the late 12th century, the Wartburg became the main residence of the [[Ludowingians]], making Eisenach a leading place in today's western Thuringia and northern Hesse, which also belonged to the Ludowingian landgraviate. In 1207, the legendary [[S\u00e4ngerkrieg]] supposedly took place at Wartburg castle.\n\nIn 1221, St. [[Elizabeth of Hungary|Elizabeth]] married Landgrave [[Louis IV, Landgrave of Thuringia|Louis' IV]] and she lived in Eisenach or at Wartburg castle until 1228.<ref name=\"Baedeker\"/>{{rp|139}} Later, she became the patroness of Thuringia and Hesse.\n\nIn 1247, the Ludowingians died out which led to the [[War of the Thuringian Succession]] between the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]]s and Duchess [[Sophie of Thuringia, Duchess of Brabant|Sophie]] of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]]. As a consequence, the landgraviate was divided. Eisenach and the eastern parts went to the Wettins (later becoming Thuringia) and [[Kassel]], [[Marburg]] and the western parts went to Sophie (later becoming Hesse). Eisenach kept a leading position among the Wettin's Thuringian cities by becoming their ''Oberhof'' (leading court), so that their law had to be derived from Eisenach's municipal law and disputes had to be resolved here. The confident citizens of Eisenach fought against the Wettin's rule to become a [[free imperial city]] between 1306 and 1308, but lost. In the 14th century various crises followed: in 1342, a big fire destroyed nearly all the buildings and the [[Black Death]] killed many inhabitants in 1349 and 1393. Since 1406, Eisenach was no longer a Wettin residence, which led to a decline in urban development. In 1485, in the \"[[Treaty of Leipzig|division of Leipzig]]\", the town fell to the [[Ernestine line]] of the Wettins.\n\n=== Early-modern period ===\n[[File:Eisenach-1647-Merian.jpg|thumb|Eisenach in 1647]]\nBetween 1498 and 1501, the young [[Martin Luther]] attended the St. George's Latin school in Eisenach in preparation for his following studies at the [[University of Erfurt]]. In 1521/22 he was hidden by [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony|Frederick the Wise]] at Wartburg castle to protect him from the [[Imperial ban]]. In that time, Luther translated the [[New Testament]] from Greek into German, in what was an important step both for the [[German Reformation]] and the development of a consistent German standard language.\n\nLuther referred to Eisenach as ''ein Pfaffennest'' (\"a clerical backwater\"), since during his time there were 300 monks and nuns per 1,000 inhabitants.<ref name=\"Baedeker\"/>{{rp|139}}\n\nIn 1525, there was heavy fighting in the area during the ''[[German Peasants' War|Bauernkrieg]]''.<ref name=\"Baedeker\"/>{{rp|139}}\nIn 1528, the Lutheran Reformation was implemented in Eisenach. In 1596, Eisenach became a ducal residence again for the house of [[Saxe-Eisenach]].\n\n[[Johann Sebastian Bach]] was born in Eisenach in 1685. His father, [[Johann Ambrosius Bach]] worked here as a musician at that time. Other famous composers and musicians associated with Eisenach during that period were [[Johann Pachelbel]], [[Johann Christoph Bach]] and [[Georg Philipp Telemann]]. As the Eisenach dukes died out in 1741, the town and the state became part of [[Saxe-Weimar]].<ref name=\"Baedeker\"/>{{rp|139}} Nevertheless, the cultural life stayed unimpaired. The coterie around the poet {{Interlanguage link multi|Julie von Bechtolsheim|de}} met up with famous personalities like [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] and [[Christoph Martin Wieland]] in Eisenach.<ref name=\"Klauss\"/>{{rp|37}}\n\nFrom 1809 to 1918, Eisenach was part of the Duchy (after 1815 Grand Duchy) of [[Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]].\n\n=== After 1815 ===\n[[File:Wartburg 1898.jpg|thumb|Car, produced in ''Automobilwerk Eisenach'' in 1898]]\n[[File:Eisenach Jakobsplan 1988.jpg|thumb|Demolition of historic buildings during the 1870s and 1880s.]]\nIn 1817, the [[Wartburg Festival]] took place in Eisenach, a meeting of students advocating moves towards a more liberal, constitutional state and a [[unification of Germany]]. The industrial revolution started relatively early in Eisenach. As early as the first half of the 19th century, the first factories were founded. In 1847, Eisenach was connected by the [[Thuringian Railway]] to [[Erfurt]] and [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]]/[[Leipzig]] in the east and in 1849 to [[Kassel]] and [[Frankfurt]] in the west. In 1858, the [[Eisenach\u2013Lichtenfels railway|Werra Railway]] to [[Lichtenfels, Bavaria|Lichtenfels]] (and further to [[Nuremberg]]) was opened.\n\nIn August 1869, the leading socialists [[August Bebel]] and [[Wilhelm Liebknecht]] founded the [[Social Democratic Workers' Party of Germany|SDAP]], one of the two predecessors of today's [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] in Eisenach.<ref name=\"Baedeker\"/>{{rp|147}} The [[Eisenach Program]] remained the party's main manifesto for the following years. The late 19th and early 20th century was the period with the fastest urban growth in Eisenach. The ''Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach'' (FFE), later ''[[Automobilwerk Eisenach]]'', basis of car production in Eisenach, was founded in 1896, the first trams ran in 1897, the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Burschenschaftsdenkmal|de}}'' (\"fraternity monument\") was erected in 1902 and the [[Bach House (Eisenach)|J. S. Bach museum]] opened in 1907. Tourists also started to arrive in this period, drawn by the pleasing landscape and the various sights within the town.\n\nBetween the 1860s and 1938, Eisenach hosted one of the largest Jewish communities in Thuringia with nearly 500 members at the beginning of the 20th century. Many Jews migrated from the [[Rh\u00f6n]] area around [[Stadtlengsfeld]] to Eisenach after their [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] in the early 19th century. The new synagogue was built in 1885 and destroyed by the Nazis during ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' in November 1938. Most Jews emigrated at that time, others were deported to concentration camps and murdered there. Before the [[World War II|Second World War]], BMW had produced motorcycles in the town.<ref>Christopher, John.  ''The Race for Hitler's X-Planes'' (The Mill, Gloucestershire:  History Press, 2013), p.71.</ref>  In preparation for World War II, new barracks were established in Eisenach and the car industry started the production of military equipment. After 1940, around 4,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] (most of them from the [[Soviet Union]]) were pressed to work in the town's factories, where some of them died due to the bad working conditions. Postwar, the managing director of the [[BMW]] [[aircraft engine]] works, Dr Schaaf, told the Fedden Mission there were as many as 11,000 working in the town, 4,500 in a plant inside a hillside turning out [[BMW 132]] engines and parts for the [[BMW 801|801]], the rest in town.<ref>Christopher, p.71.</ref>  The bombings during the war destroyed about 2,000 housing units and big parts of the car factories, as well as some historic buildings in the town centre, which were rebuilt soon after the war. The US Army arrived in Eisenach on 6 April 1945, but the Soviets took over control of the town on 1 July 1945, making it Communism's westernmost major town.\n\nEisenach was part of the [[GDR]] after 1949. The [[Inner German border]] ran only ten kilometres west of Eisenach and was closed in 1952, cutting off parts of Eisenach's traditional hinterland. The location near the border inhibited the further development during the next 40 years and the population declined through that period. Nevertheless, Eisenach remained an important industrial location. The [[BMW]] car factory was [[Socialization (economics)|socialized]] and under the new name [[Eisenacher Motorenwerk|EMW]] produced the [[Wartburg (car)|Wartburg]], the so-called \"Mercedes of the East\". The deteriorating condition of many historic houses led to a housing shortage during the 1970s. The government fought this by demolishing some historic quarters (e.g. at Jakobstra\u00dfe) and rebuilding them with ''[[Plattenbau]]'' settlements. The biggest ''Plattenbau'' district was built at the northern periphery of Eisenach between 1978 and 1985 with nearly 4,000 housing units. In 1975, the tramway system was discontinued.\n\nAfter [[German reunification]] in 1990, the economic situation changed. The car factory was taken over by [[Opel]], whereas many other factories were closed. On the other hand, Eisenach moved from the inner German border to the centre of the reunified country. Tourism saw significant growth and the Wartburg castle was designated a [[UNESCO world heritage site]] in 1999. Nevertheless, the financial situation of Eisenach remained difficult, unemployment stayed above average and car production suffered from the business problems of Opel.\n\n== Geography and climate==\n[[File:Luftbild Eisenach Altstadt Lutherstadt mit Georgenkirche Th\u00fcringen - Foto 2009 Wolfgang Pehlemann Steinberg Osttsee IMG 0488.jpg|thumb|left|Eisenach's town centre, viewed from the west]]\n\n=== Topography ===\nEisenach is situated at the northern edge of the [[Thuringian Forest]], at an elevation of about 220 m. The terrain is hilly, to the south also mountainous (up to 460 m of elevation), with the central [[H\u00f6rsel]] valley crossing the town in east-western direction. The [[Nesse (H\u00f6rsel)|Nesse]] river enters the H\u00f6rsel river in Eisenach after forming a valley through the spur of the H\u00f6rselberg mountains in the eastern municipal territory. The northern territory around the Neunkirchen, Stregda and H\u00f6tzelsroda districts is relatively flat and in agricultural use. Approximately {{convert|7|km|0|abbr=on}} west of the town centre runs the wide [[Werra]] valley, where the H\u00f6rsel river enters this bigger river near H\u00f6rschel district. The southern municipal territory is covered with forest, same as some smaller parts north of the H\u00f6rsel river. The [[Hainich]] mountains begin {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north-east of Eisenach.\n\n=== Administrative division ===\n[[File:ESA Stadtteile.png|thumb|District map]]\nEisenach abuts the districts of [[Wartburgkreis]] (municipalities [[Krauthausen]], [[Mihla]], [[Lauterbach, Thuringia|Lauterbach]], [[Bischofroda]] and [[Berka vor dem Hainich]] in the north, [[H\u00f6rselberg-Hainich]] and [[Wutha-Farnroda]] in the east and [[Marksuhl]], [[Wolfsburg-Unkeroda]] and [[Gerstungen]] in the south) and [[Werra-Mei\u00dfner-Kreis]] ([[Hesse]], municipality of [[Herleshausen]] in the west). The municipal border between Eisenach and Herleshausen was part of the [[inner German border]]/[[Iron Curtain]] from 1949 to 1990.\n\nThe municipality of Eisenach includes beside the inner town the following rural districts (all of them were incorporated in 1994): \n{|\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\" |\n*Berteroda\n*G\u00f6ringen\n*H\u00f6rschel\n*H\u00f6tzelsroda\n*Madelungen\n*Neuenhof\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\" |\n*Neukirchen\n*Stedtfeld\n*Stockhausen\n*Stregda\n*[[Wartha (Eisenach)|Wartha]]\n|}\nThe village of Fischbach was incorporated in 1922 and is a part of the inner town today.\n\n=== Climate ===\nEisenach has a [[humid continental climate]] (Dfb) or an [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb'') according to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] system.<ref name = koppen>{{cite journal| last = Kottek | first = M.|author2=J.

The town's topography creates a microclimate with mostly adequate air circulation along the west-eastern valley which made Eisenach a resort at the end of the 19th century. Annual precipitation is {{convert|831|mm|in|sp=us}} with moderate rainfall throughout the year. Light snowfall mainly occurs from December through February, but snow cover does not usually remain for long in the inner town valley.\n\n== Demographics ==\n[[File:Population of Eisenach.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population since 1830]]\nEisenach has always been one of the larger towns in Thuringia with 4,000 to 5,000 inhabitants during the Middle Ages. By 1800, the population rose to 8,000 and further to 10,000 as industrialisation started around 1850. In 1875, the town had 16,000 inhabitants, 30,000 in 1900, 43,000 in 1925 and more than 50,000 in 1940, as the peak was reached. Like the most other east German mid-sized towns, Eisenach has had a shrinking population since 1950. It declined to 48,000 in 1990, 44,000 in 2000 and 42,000 in 2012. During the last few years (2009\u20132012), the annual change was {{nobr|-0.12%}}. Suburbanization played only a small role in Eisenach. It occurred after reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas are situated within the administrative town borders.\n\nThe birth deficit was 240 in 2012, or -5.7 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was +6.5 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp|title=Th\u00fcringer Landesamt f\u00fcr Statistik|first=Th\u00fcringer Landesamt f\u00fcr|last=Statistik|date=|website=www.tls.thueringen.de|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref> The most important regions of origin of people who have moved to Eisenach are rural areas of Thuringia as well as foreign countries like Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Hungary, Serbia, Romania and Bulgaria.\n\nLike in other eastern German cities, only a small share of Eisenach's population is foreign: circa 2.3% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 4.9% are classified as \"migrants\" (according to the [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Eisenach are [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese]], [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Ukrainians in Germany|Ukrainians]].\n\nDue to the official atheism of the former [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]], most of the population is non-religious: 23.0% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 4.4% are Catholics (according to the 2011 EU census).\n\n== Economy==\n[[File:OPEL Eisenach Gesamtansicht 2009.jpg|thumb|left|A factory of [[Opel]], Eisenach's largest employer]]\n\n=== Agriculture, industry and services ===\nThe region around Eisenach is the part of Thuringia with the strongest economic base.<ref name=\"Baedeker\"/>{{rp|139}}\n\nAgriculture is not very important in Eisenach, because of the hilly terrain, the\u2014compared to central Thuringia further east\u2014less fertile soil and the relatively humid climate. However, 43% of the total municipal territory are in agricultural use, mostly as [[maize]] and [[rapeseed]] fields or as cattle pasture.\n\nThe industrial structure is relatively focused on car production. The German auto manufacturer [[Opel]] built an entirely [[Opel Eisenach|new plant]] in the northwest of the town, after the [[Wartburg (car)|Wartburg]] car plant had ceased production in 1991. The new plant opened in 1992. Most other large manufacturers in Eisenach serve as suppliers for Opel, the largest among them is [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]]. [[BMW]] runs a factory in the neighbouring municipality of [[Krauthausen]] that supplies car parts. Another component supplier is \"Truck-Lite Europe\". In 2012, there were a total of 19 industrial companies with more than 20 workers in Eisenach, employing 5,600 people and generating a turnover of more than 1.8 billion euros.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=gg000602|title=Th\u00fcringer Landesamt f\u00fcr Statistik|first=Th\u00fcringer Landesamt f\u00fcr|last=Statistik|date=|website=www.tls.thueringen.de|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref> Of those employees, 3,000 work for just two companies (Opel and Bosch), underlining the dependence of Eisenach on the [[automotive industry]].\n\nServices in Eisenach are focused on tourism with 166,000 overnight visitors spending a total of 311,000 nights in hotels in 2012. In addition, there are large numbers of (mostly German) one-day visitors.\n \nEisenach also provides services to the region (retail, hospitals, theatres, cinemas etc.).\n\nDuring recent years, the economic situation of the town improved: the unemployment rate declined from 17% in 2005 to 9% in 2013.\n\n==Attractions==\nThe [[Wartburg]] castle is, aside from [[Weimar]], the most-visited tourist attraction in Thuringia.<ref name=\"Baedeker\"/>{{rp|148}} Further sights are:\n\n=== Museums ===\nEisenach hosts a number of museums:\n* The ''[[Bach House (Eisenach)|Bachhaus]]'' at Frauenplan was the first museum worldwide to be dedicated to the life and work of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] in 1906. It was established through the [[Neue Bachgesellschaft]]. The house is over 600 years old and stands near the site of the house in the Rittergasse, which is directly in back of the museum, where Bach was born on 31 March 1685. Today, a 2007 expansion has been added to the museum and it holds several artifacts and a variety of 18th and 19th century musical instruments.<ref name=\"Baedeker\"/>{{rp|143}}\n* The ''[[Lutherhaus Eisenach|Lutherhaus]]'' at Lutherplatz is one of the oldest [[half-timbered]] buildings remaining in Eisenach. [[Martin Luther]] is said to have lived here as a pupil during his school days in Eisenach from 1498 to 1501 as a guest of the Cotta family. The building was destroyed in a fire in 1944 but had been completely rebuilt by 1966.<ref name=\"Baedeker\"/>{{rp|142}} Currently, this house is a museum featuring multimedia exhibits relating to the period.

Built by Ludwig Bohnstedt between 1866 and 1868, this [[Renaissance Revival architecture|neo-renaissance]] house was the home of Fritz Reuter, a well-known poet of the Low German dialect, from 1868 until his death in 1874. Reuter's home was acquired by the town in 1895 and turned into a memorial. That same year the collection of Nicolaus Oesterlein containing several thousand books on Richard Wagner (virtually the complete primary and secondary literature on Wagner of the 19th century) was added. Since 1997, this collection\u2014the second largest in the world after [[Bayreuth]]\u2014has been presented in a new exhibit on the ground floor, which also includes all the material on ''[[Tannh\u00e4user (opera)|Tannh\u00e4user]]'', an opera set at the Wartburg.<ref name=\"Klauss\">{{cite book|last=Klau\u00df|first=Jochen|title=Th\u00fcringen - Literarische Streifz\u00fcge (German)|publisher=Artemis & Winkler (Patmos)|year=2009|isbn=978-3-538-07280-0| pages=}}</ref>{{rp|32\u201333}}<ref name=RWM>{{cite web|url=http://www.eisenach.de/Rundgang.3141.0.html|title=Reuter-Wagner-Museum - Rundgang (German)|publisher=Eisenach Town Council|accessdate=24 January 2014}}</ref>\n* The museum inside the ''Predigerkirche'' at Predigerplatz hosts the medieval art division of the ''Th\u00fcringer Museum''. \n* The ''Goldener L\u00f6we'' at Marienstra\u00dfe shows an historical exhibition of German social democracy.

The early-modern period brought extensions to the west (Katharinenstra\u00dfe), to the north (Jakobstra\u00dfe) and to the east (in front of Nikolaitor gate). The construction boom between 1850 and 1914 led to a strict division in urban development. South of the historic centre, mansion districts were established on the hillsides of Mariental valley, where the rich factory owners, rentiers and other upper-class people lived. These districts are among the most important examples of this urban type in Germany, and one of the largest in Europe.<ref name=\"Baedeker\"/>{{rp|147}} North of the historic centre, next to the railway and H\u00f6rsel river, factories and worker quarters were established. These also host some examples of interesting [[Gr\u00fcnderzeit]] architecture. After [[World War I]], the town extended further to the north on the other bank of H\u00f6rsel river, where some new residential areas were developed before 1990.\n\n====Square ensembles====\n* ''Karlsplatz'': adjoins the Nikolaikirche (Church of St. Nicholas) and the Romanesque Nikolaitor (St. Nicholas Gate), the only surviving town gate (out of five). The square is seen as the nucleus of the town, it was first mentioned in 1368.<ref name=\"Baedeker\"/>{{rp|142}}\n* ''Marktplatz'': the market square with the Georgenkirche (Church of St. George), the town hall, the Baroque ''Stadtschloss'', as well as a number of highly decorative administration buildings and merchants' houses. It also features the gilded market fountain designed by Hans Leonardt in 1549, showing St. George, the patron saint of Eisenach.\n* ''Jakobsplan'': named after a chapel destroyed by fire in the Middle Ages. Jakobsplan comprises a monument to St. George in the centre of the square, part of the old town walls (including one of the watch towers), and the Goethe Garden.\n* ''Frauenplan'': a small courtyard-type square that takes its name from the \"Church of Our Lady\". The church was demolished for defence purposes in 1306. Today Frauenplan is the location of the ''Bachhaus'' and the Bach monument in front of it.\n\n=== Sights and architectural heritage ===\n\n==== Churches ====\n* ''St. George's Church'' (Lutheran) at the market square was first built in the 12th century. The church in which St. Elisabeth was married was demolished in 1515 and replaced by a new structure. Martin Luther held a sermon there on 2 May 1521. In 1525, the church was heavily damaged during the ''Bauernkrieg'' and during the Reformation it served as a stables. It was rededicated in 1558. On 23 March 1685, Johann Sebastian Bach was baptized in the church (the 16th century baptismal font still remains). The tower was added in 1898\u20131902.<ref name=\"Baedeker\"/>{{rp|142}} \n* ''St. Nicholas' Church'' (Lutheran), located on the Karlsplatz, served the [[Benedictine]] convent once located in the area.

For further information, see: [[Wartburg]]. \n* The ''Stadtschloss'' (town palace) is situated at the north end of the Marktplatz and was built between 1742 and 1745. This palace was constructed to the plans of Gottfried Heinrich Krohne, architect of Duke [[Ernst August I, Duke of Saxe-Weimar|Ernst August I]] of [[Duchy of Saxe-Weimar|Saxe-Weimar]].<ref name=\"Baedeker\"/>{{rp|140}} After 1777 [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] frequently stayed here in his capacity as the duke's prime minister.<ref name=\"Klauss\"/>{{rp|36\u201337}} Today the Stadtschloss acts as a venue for special exhibitions and as a museum for artistic and historical artifacts from Thuringia.\n* ''Hellgrevenhof'' at Georgenstra\u00dfe is part of a former inner-town castle, named after Heinrich Hellgreve, a rich citizen who lived here in the late 13th century.

Financed by other well-known musicians, the more-than-life-size figure portrays Johann Sebastian Bach in his [[Thomaskirche (Leipzig)|St. Thomas's]] choir-master's clothes and wig. It is situated on the Frauenplan next to the ''Bachhaus''.\n* The ''Martin Luther monument'' at Karlsplatz was designed by Adolf von Donndorf and was dedicated on 4 May 1895 on the 374th anniversary of Luther's arrival at Wartburg castle. The more-than-life-size statue of Martin Luther on a pedestal also has reliefs depicting events of his life leading up to and including his stay in Eisenach as well as the title of one of his most famous hymns, \"Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott\" (\"[[A Mighty Fortress Is Our God]]\")\n* The ''Burschenschaftsdenkmal'' (literally: \"Monument to Student Fraternities\") on G\u00f6pelskuppe hill was built in 1902. The monument stands on a hill opposite the Wartburg in memory of the members of the liberal and nationalistic student movement and others who were killed in the struggle for a united Germany between 1864 and 1871.<ref name=\"Baedeker\"/>{{rp|148}} The monument that reaches a height of 33 meters and proclaims \"Honour, Freedom, and Fatherland\", was dedicated on 22 May 1902 and was extended in 1933 to honour those who fell in World War I.

Remains visible today are the ''Nikolaitor'' and the ''Glockenturm''. \n* The ''Kartausgarten'' is all that remains of the original [[Carthusian]] monastery, consecrated to St. Elizabeth in 1380. In 1700 it became a royal kitchen garden and around 1800 was changed into a park. The \"Wandelhalle\" (covered walk and foyer), built in 1906,<ref name=\"Baedeker\"/>{{rp|147}} was originally intended as a pump room to a [[spa]] planned for Eisenach that never materialised.\n* The ''town hall'' at Marktplatz was a former wine cellar and became the townhall of Eisenach in 1596. The building, having been destroyed by fire in 1636, was rebuilt in 1641. The southern part of the complex suffered considerable damage in a bombing raid in 1945 during [[World War II]]. It was renovated in 1996 and it now houses the municipal administration offices. \n* The ''Landestheater'' (state theatre) was established in 1879<ref name=\"Baedeker\"/>{{rp|147}} by Julius von Eichel-Streiber and constructed to the design of the [[Leipzig]] architect Karl Weichardt. It was later renovated in 1993. The theatre holds an audience of 600 and has two balconies. \n* The ''narrow house'' may be the narrowest half-timbered house in Germany. It was built before 1750 and is only 2.05 meters wide. Inside visitors can view a small exhibition.

Furthermore, there is the [[Eisenach\u2013Lichtenfels railway|Werra Railway]], a former main-line railway between north and south Germany from Eisenach via [[Meiningen]] to [[Eisfeld]], which since the division of Germany after World War II has served only for regional transport. At the former inner German border, it is still interrupted between Eisfeld and [[Coburg]], but rebuilding is in discussion. [[Eisenach station]] is a stop of all long-distance trains from Frankfurt to Leipzig/[[Dresden]], running once an hour. Local trains, also once an hour, start in Eisenach to Halle via Erfurt, to [[Sonneberg]] via Meiningen and Eisfeld and to [[Bebra]] via [[Gerstungen]]. Freight transport is important at Eisenach's Opel factory which has its own terminal. Further local passenger stations are Eisenach-West, Eisenach-Opelwerk and H\u00f6rschel.\n\nEisenach is located on the [[Bundesautobahn 4]] from Frankfurt in the west to Erfurt and Dresden in the east. Since 2010, the Autobahn has been moved to a new route farther away from the town to protect the residents from noise and air pollution. Moreover, it was not possible to expand the old route because of the mountainous topography. After 2010, parts of the old route became a town highway, whereas other parts were renaturalized. A second Autobahn between Eisenach and Kassel is in construction ([[Bundesautobahn 44]]). There are four [[Bundesstra\u00dfe]]n connecting Eisenach: The [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 7]] runs to Kassel in the north-west, whereas its eastern branch to [[Gotha]] was annulled in 2010. The [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 19]] leads to Meiningen in the south, the [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 84]] to [[Bad Langensalza]] in the north-east and to [[Fulda]] via [[Vacha, Germany|Vacha]] in the south-west and the [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 88]] is a connection to [[Ilmenau]] in the south-east. Furthermore, there are two important secondary roads to [[M\u00fchlhausen]] via [[Mihla]] in the north and to [[Herleshausen]] in the west through the H\u00f6rsel valley. Downtown traffic is concentrated on Rennbahn street, which often leads to congestion due to a large number of commuters and the town's narrow topography.\n\nThe next local airports are the [[Erfurt-Weimar Airport]], about {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the east and the [[Kassel Calden Airport]], roughly {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north-west. Both offer service to tourist destinations. The next major international airport is [[Frankfurt Airport]], circa {{convert|200|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-west. Kindel Airfield, {{convert|12|km|0|abbr=on}} east of Eisenach, is a former Soviet military base, today used for private aviation.\n\nBiking is getting more and more popular since the construction of quality cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Long distance trails include the ''Werra trail'', the ''[[Rennsteig]] trail'' and the ''Radweg Th\u00fcringer St\u00e4dtekette'' (\"Thuringian town string trail\"). These all connect points of touristic interest, the first along the [[Werra]] valley from the [[Thuringian Forest]] to the [[Weser]] river in [[Hann. M\u00fcnden]], the second through the Thuringian Forest along its crest to the [[Saale]] river near [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]] and the third follows near the medieval [[Via Regia]] from the Werra valley/Eisenach via Gotha, Erfurt and [[Weimar]] to [[Altenburg]].\n\nPublic transport in Eisenach is by a bus network servicing the downtown areas as well as the neighbouring towns and villages. The three-line tramway system of Eisenach was in operation between 1897 and 1975.\n\n== Education ==\nAfter reunification, the educational system was reformed. Eisenach currently has six state-run and one Protestant primary schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eisenach.de/Grundschulen.528.0.html|title=Allgemeinbildende Schulen|first=Stadt|last=Eisenach|date=16 March 2018|website=eisenach.de|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nThere are two types of secondary school in Germany.

It is the main urban centre of western Thuringia and bordering northeastern [[Hesse|Hessian]] regions, situated near the former [[Inner German border]]. A major attraction is [[Wartburg]] castle, which has been a [[UNESCO world heritage]] site since 1999.\n\nEisenach was an early capital of Thuringia in the 12th and 13th centuries. St.{{nbsp}}[[Elizabeth of Hungary|Elizabeth]] lived at the court of the [[Ludowingians]] here between 1211 and 1228. Later, [[Martin Luther]] came to Eisenach and translated the [[Luther Bible|Bible]] into German. In 1685, [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] was born here. During the [[early modern period]], Eisenach was a residence of the Ernestine [[House of Wettin|Wettins]] and was visited by numerous representatives of [[Weimar classicism]] like [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]].<ref name=\"Klauss\"/>{{rp|22\u201325}} In 1869, the [[Social Democratic Workers' Party of Germany|SDAP]], one of the two precursors of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) was founded in Eisenach.\n\nCar production is an important industry in Eisenach. The ''[[Automobilwerk Eisenach]]'' was founded in 1896. In the [[German Democratic Republic]], the [[Wartburg (car)|Wartburg]] was produced here.\n\nEisenach is situated on the [[H\u00f6rsel]] river, a tributary of the [[Werra]] between the [[Thuringian Forest]] in the south, the [[Hainich]] mountains in the north-east and the [[East Hesse Highlands]] in the north-west.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Nikolaikirche and Nikoliator.jpg|thumb|left|Nikolaikirche (left) and Nikolaitor (right)]]\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nEisenach's origin and early history is unknown. An 8th century Frankish settlement near Petersberg hill is regarded as the nucleus of Eisenach. However, there are no written sources about that early period. According to legend, [[Louis the Springer]] began in 1067 to establish [[Wartburg]] castle above the settlement.<ref name=\"Baedeker\"/>{{rp|139}}\n\nIn 1080, the castle was first mentioned in a Saxon chronicle. Eisenach itself followed in a document dating to 1150 where it was referred to as \"Isinacha\".<ref name=\"Baedeker\"/>{{rp|139}} During the 1180s, the town was established by the construction of three independent market settlements around the Saturday's market (today's Karlsplatz), the Wednesday's market (today's Frauenplan) and the Monday's market (today's Marktplatz). Due to its convenient location at a bottleneck between the [[Thuringian Forest]] in the south and the [[Hainich]] mountains in the north, Eisenach benefitted from substantial west-east trade along [[Via Regia]] from [[Frankfurt]] to [[Erfurt]] and [[Leipzig]] and became a rich merchant town. During the second half of the 12th century, the town walls were erected (the Nikolaitor is an important relict of this wall) and Eisenach got a planned grid of streets and alleys. In the late 12th century, the Wartburg became the main residence of the [[Ludowingians]], making Eisenach a leading place in today's western Thuringia and northern Hesse, which also belonged to the Ludowingian landgraviate. In 1207, the legendary [[S\u00e4ngerkrieg]] supposedly took place at Wartburg castle.\n\nIn 1221, St. [[Elizabeth of Hungary|Elizabeth]] married Landgrave [[Louis IV, Landgrave of Thuringia|Louis' IV]] and she lived in Eisenach or at Wartburg castle until 1228.<ref name=\"Baedeker\"/>{{rp|139}} Later, she became the patroness of Thuringia and Hesse.\n\nIn 1247, the Ludowingians died out which led to the [[War of the Thuringian Succession]] between the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]]s and Duchess [[Sophie of Thuringia, Duchess of Brabant|Sophie]] of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]]. As a consequence, the landgraviate was divided. Eisenach and the eastern parts went to the Wettins (later becoming Thuringia) and [[Kassel]], [[Marburg]] and the western parts went to Sophie (later becoming Hesse). Eisenach kept a leading position among the Wettin's Thuringian cities by becoming their ''Oberhof'' (leading court), so that their law had to be derived from Eisenach's municipal law and disputes had to be resolved here. The confident citizens of Eisenach fought against the Wettin's rule to become a [[free imperial city]] between 1306 and 1308, but lost. In the 14th century various crises followed: in 1342, a big fire destroyed nearly all the buildings and the [[Black Death]] killed many inhabitants in 1349 and 1393. Since 1406, Eisenach was no longer a Wettin residence, which led to a decline in urban development. In 1485, in the \"[[Treaty of Leipzig|division of Leipzig]]\", the town fell to the [[Ernestine line]] of the Wettins.\n\n=== Early-modern period ===\n[[File:Eisenach-1647-Merian.jpg|thumb|Eisenach in 1647]]\nBetween 1498 and 1501, the young [[Martin Luther]] attended the St. George's Latin school in Eisenach in preparation for his following studies at the [[University of Erfurt]]. In 1521/22 he was hidden by [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony|Frederick the Wise]] at Wartburg castle to protect him from the [[Imperial ban]]. In that time, Luther translated the [[New Testament]] from Greek into German, in what was an important step both for the [[German Reformation]] and the development of a consistent German standard language.\n\nLuther referred to Eisenach as ''ein Pfaffennest'' (\"a clerical backwater\"), since during his time there were 300 monks and nuns per 1,000 inhabitants.<ref name=\"Baedeker\"/>{{rp|139}}\n\nIn 1525, there was heavy fighting in the area during the ''[[German Peasants' War|Bauernkrieg]]''.<ref name=\"Baedeker\"/>{{rp|139}}\nIn 1528, the Lutheran Reformation was implemented in Eisenach. In 1596, Eisenach became a ducal residence again for the house of [[Saxe-Eisenach]].\n\n[[Johann Sebastian Bach]] was born in Eisenach in 1685. His father, [[Johann Ambrosius Bach]] worked here as a musician at that time. Other famous composers and musicians associated with Eisenach during that period were [[Johann Pachelbel]], [[Johann Christoph Bach]] and [[Georg Philipp Telemann]]. As the Eisenach dukes died out in 1741, the town and the state became part of [[Saxe-Weimar]].<ref name=\"Baedeker\"/>{{rp|139}} Nevertheless, the cultural life stayed unimpaired. The coterie around the poet {{Interlanguage link multi|Julie von Bechtolsheim|de}} met up with famous personalities like [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] and [[Christoph Martin Wieland]] in Eisenach.<ref name=\"Klauss\"/>{{rp|37}}\n\nFrom 1809 to 1918, Eisenach was part of the Duchy (after 1815 Grand Duchy) of [[Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]].\n\n=== After 1815 ===\n[[File:Wartburg 1898.jpg|thumb|Car, produced in ''Automobilwerk Eisenach'' in 1898]]\n[[File:Eisenach Jakobsplan 1988.jpg|thumb|Demolition of historic buildings during the 1870s and 1880s.]]\nIn 1817, the [[Wartburg Festival]] took place in Eisenach, a meeting of students advocating moves towards a more liberal, constitutional state and a [[unification of Germany]]. The industrial revolution started relatively early in Eisenach. As early as the first half of the 19th century, the first factories were founded. In 1847, Eisenach was connected by the [[Thuringian Railway]] to [[Erfurt]] and [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]]/[[Leipzig]] in the east and in 1849 to [[Kassel]] and [[Frankfurt]] in the west. In 1858, the [[Eisenach\u2013Lichtenfels railway|Werra Railway]] to [[Lichtenfels, Bavaria|Lichtenfels]] (and further to [[Nuremberg]]) was opened.\n\nIn August 1869, the leading socialists [[August Bebel]] and [[Wilhelm Liebknecht]] founded the [[Social Democratic Workers' Party of Germany|SDAP]], one of the two predecessors of today's [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] in Eisenach.<ref name=\"Baedeker\"/>{{rp|147}} The [[Eisenach Program]] remained the party's main manifesto for the following years. The late 19th and early 20th century was the period with the fastest urban growth in Eisenach. The ''Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach'' (FFE), later ''[[Automobilwerk Eisenach]]'', basis of car production in Eisenach, was founded in 1896, the first trams ran in 1897, the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Burschenschaftsdenkmal|de}}'' (\"fraternity monument\") was erected in 1902 and the [[Bach House (Eisenach)|J. S. Bach museum]] opened in 1907. Tourists also started to arrive in this period, drawn by the pleasing landscape and the various sights within the town.\n\nBetween the 1860s and 1938, Eisenach hosted one of the largest Jewish communities in Thuringia with nearly 500 members at the beginning of the 20th century. Many Jews migrated from the [[Rh\u00f6n]] area around [[Stadtlengsfeld]] to Eisenach after their [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] in the early 19th century. The new synagogue was built in 1885 and destroyed by the Nazis during ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' in November 1938. Most Jews emigrated at that time, others were deported to concentration camps and murdered there. Before the [[World War II|Second World War]], BMW had produced motorcycles in the town.<ref>Christopher, John.  ''The Race for Hitler's X-Planes'' (The Mill, Gloucestershire:  History Press, 2013), p.71.</ref>  In preparation for World War II, new barracks were established in Eisenach and the car industry started the production of military equipment. After 1940, around 4,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] (most of them from the [[Soviet Union]]) were pressed to work in the town's factories, where some of them died due to the bad working conditions. Postwar, the managing director of the [[BMW]] [[aircraft engine]] works, Dr Schaaf, told the Fedden Mission there were as many as 11,000 working in the town, 4,500 in a plant inside a hillside turning out [[BMW 132]] engines and parts for the [[BMW 801|801]], the rest in town.<ref>Christopher, p.71.</ref>  The bombings during the war destroyed about 2,000 housing units and big parts of the car factories, as well as some historic buildings in the town centre, which were rebuilt soon after the war. The US Army arrived in Eisenach on 6 April 1945, but the Soviets took over control of the town on 1 July 1945, making it Communism's westernmost major town.\n\nEisenach was part of the [[GDR]] after 1949. The [[Inner German border]] ran only ten kilometres west of Eisenach and was closed in 1952, cutting off parts of Eisenach's traditional hinterland. The location near the border inhibited the further development during the next 40 years and the population declined through that period. Nevertheless, Eisenach remained an important industrial location. The [[BMW]] car factory was [[Socialization (economics)|socialized]] and under the new name [[Eisenacher Motorenwerk|EMW]] produced the [[Wartburg (car)|Wartburg]], the so-called \"Mercedes of the East\". The deteroriating condition of many historic houses led to a housing shortage during the 1970s. The government fought this by demolishing some historic quarters (e.g. at Jakobstra\u00dfe) and rebuilding them with ''[[Plattenbau]]'' settlements. The biggest ''Plattenbau'' district was built at the northern periphery of Eisenach between 1978 and 1985 with nearly 4,000 housing units. In 1975, the tramway system was discontinued.\n\nAfter [[German reunification]] in 1990, the economic situation changed. The car factory was taken over by [[Opel]], whereas many other factories were closed. On the other hand, Eisenach moved from the inner German border to the centre of the reunified country. Tourism saw significant growth and the Wartburg castle was designated a [[UNESCO world heritage site]] in 1999. Nevertheless, the financial situation of Eisenach remained difficult, unemployment stayed above average and car production suffered from the business problems of Opel.\n\n== Geography and climate==\n[[File:Luftbild Eisenach Altstadt Lutherstadt mit Georgenkirche Th\u00fcringen - Foto 2009 Wolfgang Pehlemann Steinberg Osttsee IMG 0488.jpg|thumb|left|Eisenach's town centre, viewed from the west]]\n\n=== Topography ===\nEisenach is situated at the northern edge of the [[Thuringian Forest]], at an elevation of about 220 m. The terrain is hilly, to the south also mountainous (up to 460 m of elevation), with the central [[H\u00f6rsel]] valley crossing the town in east-western direction. The [[Nesse (H\u00f6rsel)|Nesse]] river enters the H\u00f6rsel river in Eisenach after forming a valley through the spur of the H\u00f6rselberg mountains in the eastern municipal territory. The northern territory around the Neunkirchen, Stregda and H\u00f6tzelsroda districts is relatively flat and in agricultural use. Approximately {{convert|7|km|0|abbr=on}} west of the town centre runs the wide [[Werra]] valley, where the H\u00f6rsel river enters this bigger river near H\u00f6rschel district. The southern municipal territory is covered with forest, same as some smaller parts north of the H\u00f6rsel river. The [[Hainich]] mountains begin {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north-east of Eisenach.\n\n=== Administrative division ===\n[[File:ESA Stadtteile.png|thumb|District map]]\nEisenach abuts the districts of [[Wartburgkreis]] (municipalities [[Krauthausen]], [[Mihla]], [[Lauterbach, Thuringia|Lauterbach]], [[Bischofroda]] and [[Berka vor dem Hainich]] in the north, [[H\u00f6rselberg-Hainich]] and [[Wutha-Farnroda]] in the east and [[Marksuhl]], [[Wolfsburg-Unkeroda]] and [[Gerstungen]] in the south) and [[Werra-Mei\u00dfner-Kreis]] ([[Hesse]], municipality of [[Herleshausen]] in the west). The municipal border between Eisenach and Herleshausen was part of the [[inner German border]]/[[Iron Curtain]] from 1949 to 1990.\n\nThe municipality of Eisenach includes beside the inner town the following rural districts (all of them were incorporated in 1994): \n{|\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\" |\n*Berteroda\n*G\u00f6ringen\n*H\u00f6rschel\n*H\u00f6tzelsroda\n*Madelungen\n*Neuenhof\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\" |\n*Neukirchen\n*Stedtfeld\n*Stockhausen\n*Stregda\n*[[Wartha (Eisenach)|Wartha]]\n|}\nThe village of Fischbach was incorporated in 1922 and is a part of the inner town today.\n\n=== Climate ===\nEisenach has a [[humid continental climate]] (Dfb) or an [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb'') according to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] system.<ref name = koppen>{{cite journal| last = Kottek | first = M.|author2=J.

The town's topography creates a microclimate with mostly adequate air circulation along the west-eastern valley which made Eisenach a resort at the end of the 19th century. Annual precipitation is {{convert|831|mm|in|sp=us}} with moderate rainfall throughout the year. Light snowfall mainly occurs from December through February, but snow cover does not usually remain for long in the inner town valley.\n\n== Demographics ==\n[[File:Population of Eisenach.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population since 1830]]\nEisenach has always been one of the larger towns in Thuringia with 4,000 to 5,000 inhabitants during the Middle Ages. By 1800, the population rose to 8,000 and further to 10,000 as industrialisation started around 1850. In 1875, the town had 16,000 inhabitants, 30,000 in 1900, 43,000 in 1925 and more than 50,000 in 1940, as the peak was reached. Like the most other east German mid-sized towns, Eisenach has had a shrinking population since 1950. It declined to 48,000 in 1990, 44,000 in 2000 and 42,000 in 2012. During the last few years (2009\u20132012), the annual change was {{nobr|-0.12%}}. Suburbanization played only a small role in Eisenach. It occurred after reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas are situated within the administrative town borders.\n\nThe birth deficit was 240 in 2012, or -5.7 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was +6.5 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp|title=Th\u00fcringer Landesamt f\u00fcr Statistik|first=Th\u00fcringer Landesamt f\u00fcr|last=Statistik|date=|website=www.tls.thueringen.de|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref> The most important regions of origin of people who have moved to Eisenach are rural areas of Thuringia as well as foreign countries like Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Hungary, Serbia, Romania and Bulgaria.\n\nLike in other eastern German cities, only a small share of Eisenach's population is foreign: circa 2.3% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 4.9% are classified as \"migrants\" (according to the [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Eisenach are [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese]], [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Ukrainians in Germany|Ukrainians]].\n\nDue to the official atheism of the former [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]], most of the population is non-religious: 23.0% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 4.4% are Catholics (according to the 2011 EU census).\n\n== Economy==\n[[File:OPEL Eisenach Gesamtansicht 2009.jpg|thumb|left|A factory of [[Opel]], Eisenach's largest employer]]\n\n=== Agriculture, industry and services ===\nThe region around Eisenach is the part of Thuringia with the strongest economic base.<ref name=\"Baedeker\"/>{{rp|139}}\n\nAgriculture is not very important in Eisenach, because of the hilly terrain, the\u2014compared to central Thuringia further east\u2014less fertile soil and the relatively humid climate. However, 43% of the total municipal territory are in agricultural use, mostly as [[maize]] and [[rapeseed]] fields or as cattle pasture.\n\nThe industrial structure is relatively focused on car production. The German auto manufacturer [[Opel]] built an entirely [[Opel Eisenach|new plant]] in the northwest of the town, after the [[Wartburg (car)|Wartburg]] car plant had ceased production in 1991. The new plant opened in 1992. Most other large manufacturers in Eisenach serve as suppliers for Opel, the largest among them is [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]]. [[BMW]] runs a factory in the neighbouring municipality of [[Krauthausen]] that supplies car parts. Another component supplier is \"Truck-Lite Europe\". In 2012, there were a total of 19 industrial companies with more than 20 workers in Eisenach, employing 5,600 people and generating a turnover of more than 1.8 billion euros.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=gg000602|title=Th\u00fcringer Landesamt f\u00fcr Statistik|first=Th\u00fcringer Landesamt f\u00fcr|last=Statistik|date=|website=www.tls.thueringen.de|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref> Of those employees, 3,000 work for just two companies (Opel and Bosch), underlining the dependence of Eisenach on the [[automotive industry]].\n\nServices in Eisenach are focused on tourism with 166,000 overnight visitors spending a total of 311,000 nights in hotels in 2012. In addition, there are large numbers of (mostly German) one-day visitors.\n \nEisenach also provides services to the region (retail, hospitals, theatres, cinemas etc.).\n\nDuring recent years, the economic situation of the town improved: the unemployment rate declined from 17% in 2005 to 9% in 2013.\n\n==Attractions==\nThe [[Wartburg]] castle is, aside from [[Weimar]], the most-visited tourist attraction in Thuringia.<ref name=\"Baedeker\"/>{{rp|148}} Further sights are:\n\n=== Museums ===\nEisenach hosts a number of museums:\n* The ''[[Bach House (Eisenach)|Bachhaus]]'' at Frauenplan was the first museum worldwide to be dedicated to the life and work of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] in 1906. It was established through the [[Neue Bachgesellschaft]]. The house is over 600 years old and stands near the site of the house in the Rittergasse, which is directly in back of the museum, where Bach was born on 31 March 1685. Today, a 2007 expansion has been added to the museum and it holds several artifacts and a variety of 18th and 19th century musical instruments.<ref name=\"Baedeker\"/>{{rp|143}}\n* The ''[[Lutherhaus Eisenach|Lutherhaus]]'' at Lutherplatz is one of the oldest [[half-timbered]] buildings remaining in Eisenach. [[Martin Luther]] is said to have lived here as a pupil during his school days in Eisenach from 1498 to 1501 as a guest of the Cotta family. The building was destroyed in a fire in 1944 but had been completely rebuilt by 1966.<ref name=\"Baedeker\"/>{{rp|142}} Currently, this house is a museum featuring multimedia exhibits relating to the period.

Built by Ludwig Bohnstedt between 1866 and 1868, this [[Renaissance Revival architecture|neo-renaissance]] house was the home of Fritz Reuter, a well-known poet of the Low German dialect, from 1868 until his death in 1874. Reuter's home was acquired by the town in 1895 and turned into a memorial. That same year the collection of Nicolaus Oesterlein containing several thousand books on Richard Wagner (virtually the complete primary and secondary literature on Wagner of the 19th century) was added. Since 1997, this collection\u2014the second largest in the world after [[Bayreuth]]\u2014has been presented in a new exhibit on the ground floor, which also includes all the material on ''[[Tannh\u00e4user (opera)|Tannh\u00e4user]]'', an opera set at the Wartburg.<ref name=\"Klauss\">{{cite book|last=Klau\u00df|first=Jochen|title=Th\u00fcringen - Literarische Streifz\u00fcge (German)|publisher=Artemis & Winkler (Patmos)|year=2009|isbn=978-3-538-07280-0| pages=}}</ref>{{rp|32\u201333}}<ref name=RWM>{{cite web|url=http://www.eisenach.de/Rundgang.3141.0.html|title=Reuter-Wagner-Museum - Rundgang (German)|publisher=Eisenach Town Council|accessdate=24 January 2014}}</ref>\n* The museum inside the ''Predigerkirche'' at Predigerplatz hosts the medieval art division of the ''Th\u00fcringer Museum''. \n* The ''Goldener L\u00f6we'' at Marienstra\u00dfe shows an historical exhibition of German social democracy.

The early-modern period brought extensions to the west (Katharinenstra\u00dfe), to the north (Jakobstra\u00dfe) and to the east (in front of Nikolaitor gate). The construction boom between 1850 and 1914 led to a strict division in urban development. South of the historic centre, mansion districts were established on the hillsides of Mariental valley, where the rich factory owners, rentiers and other upper-class people lived. These districts are among the most important examples of this urban type in Germany, and one of the largest in Europe.<ref name=\"Baedeker\"/>{{rp|147}} North of the historic centre, next to the railway and H\u00f6rsel river, factories and worker quarters were established. These also host some examples of interesting [[Gr\u00fcnderzeit]] architecture. After [[World War I]], the town extended further to the north on the other bank of H\u00f6rsel river, where some new residential areas were developed before 1990.\n\n====Square ensembles====\n* ''Karlsplatz'': adjoins the Nikolaikirche (Church of St. Nicholas) and the Romanesque Nikolaitor (St. Nicholas Gate), the only surviving town gate (out of five). The square is seen as the nucleus of the town, it was first mentioned in 1368.<ref name=\"Baedeker\"/>{{rp|142}}\n* ''Marktplatz'': the market square with the Georgenkirche (Church of St. George), the town hall, the Baroque ''Stadtschloss'', as well as a number of highly decorative administration buildings and merchants' houses. It also features the gilded market fountain designed by Hans Leonardt in 1549, showing St. George, the patron saint of Eisenach.\n* ''Jakobsplan'': named after a chapel destroyed by fire in the Middle Ages. Jakobsplan comprises a monument to St. George in the centre of the square, part of the old town walls (including one of the watch towers), and the Goethe Garden.\n* ''Frauenplan'': a small courtyard-type square that takes its name from the \"Church of Our Lady\". The church was demolished for defence purposes in 1306. Today Frauenplan is the location of the ''Bachhaus'' and the Bach monument in front of it.\n\n=== Sights and architectural heritage ===\n\n==== Churches ====\n* ''St. George's Church'' (Lutheran) at the market square was first built in the 12th century. The church in which St. Elisabeth was married was demolished in 1515 and replaced by a new structure. Martin Luther held a sermon there on 2 May 1521. In 1525, the church was heavily damaged during the ''Bauernkrieg'' and during the Reformation it served as a stables. It was rededicated in 1558. On 23 March 1685, Johann Sebastian Bach was baptized in the church (the 16th century baptismal font still remains). The tower was added in 1898\u20131902.<ref name=\"Baedeker\"/>{{rp|142}} \n* ''St. Nicholas' Church'' (Lutheran), located on the Karlsplatz, served the [[Benedictine]] convent once located in the area. This triple-naved basilica was built in 1180.<ref name=\"Baedeker\"/>{{rp|139}} It is considered the latest example of [[Romanesque architecture]] in Thuringia.\n* ''Preachers' Church'' (secularized) at Predigerplatz was part of a former [[Dominican order|Dominican]] monastery (founded in 1240 and the only monastery buildings of which remain in the town), today used as a museum for medieval art.<ref name=\"Baedeker\"/>{{rp|146}} \n* ''St. Elizabeth's Church'' (Roman Catholic) at Sophienstra\u00dfe is the Catholic parish church of Eisenach, built in [[neo-Gothic style]] in the 1880s.<ref name=\"Baedeker\"/>{{rp|147}}  \n* ''St. Anne's Church'' (Lutheran) at Georgenstra\u00dfe was founded together with a hospital by St. Elizabeth in 1226. \n* ''St. Clement's Chapel'' (Lutheran) at Clemensstra\u00dfe is a small 13th century Romanesque chapel.\n* ''Holy Cross Church'' (secularized) at the old cemetery was built in the 1690s.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Stadtkirche Eisenach Westseite.JPG|St. George's Church\nFile:ESA Nikolaikirche.jpg|St. Nicholas' Church\nFile:ESA Predigerkloster.jpg|Preachers' Church \nFile:Kath Kirche Eisenach xp.jpg|St. Elizabeth's Church\nFile:ESA Annenkirche.jpg|St. Anne's Church\nFile:Clemenskapelle2.JPG|St. Clement's Chapel\nFile:ESA Kreuzkirche Bild6.jpg|Holy Cross Church\n</gallery>\n\n==== Castles and palaces ====\n* The most important castle is the Wartburg above the town. For further information, see: [[Wartburg]]. \n* The ''Stadtschloss'' (town palace) is situated at the north end of the Marktplatz and was built between 1742 and 1745. This palace was constructed to the plans of Gottfried Heinrich Krohne, architect of Duke [[Ernst August I, Duke of Saxe-Weimar|Ernst August I]] of [[Duchy of Saxe-Weimar|Saxe-Weimar]].<ref name=\"Baedeker\"/>{{rp|140}} After 1777 [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] frequently stayed here in his capacity as the duke's prime minister.<ref name=\"Klauss\"/>{{rp|36\u201337}} Today the Stadtschloss acts as a venue for special exhibitions and as a museum for artistic and historical artifacts from Thuringia.\n* ''Hellgrevenhof'' at Georgenstra\u00dfe is part of a former inner-town castle, named after Heinrich Hellgreve, a rich citizen who lived here in the late 13th century. It consists of five buildings, the oldest dating to around 1200, although it has been modified several times over the centuries.<ref name=\"Klauss\"/>{{rp|35}}  \n* ''Bechtolsheim Palace'' at Jakobsplan is a [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] palace, built in the late 18th century. \n* ''Schloss Fischbach'' in Fischbach district is a small 17th-century castle.\n* ''Jagdschloss Hohe Sonne'' is a hunting lodge south of the city in the Thuringian Forest. It was built in the mid-18th century in the Baroque style. \n* ''Alte Residenz'' at Esplanade is the relic of the former ducal residence, rebuilt in the Renaissance style after older predecessors.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Eisenach Wartburg 07.JPG|Wartburg\nFile:EISEnachmarktschloss.jpg|''Stadtschloss''\nFile:ESA Bechtholzheim.jpg|Bechtolsheim Palace\nFile:ESA FISCHBACH.jpg|''Schloss Fischbach''\nFile:ESA HOHESONNE2.JPG|''Jagdschloss Hohe Sonne''\nFile:ESA RESIDENZHS2.jpg|''Alte Residenz''\n</gallery>\n\n==== Memorials ====\n* The ''Bach monument'' was constructed in 1884 by [[Adolf von Donndorf]]. Financed by other well-known musicians, the more-than-life-size figure portrays Johann Sebastian Bach in his [[Thomaskirche (Leipzig)|St. Thomas's]] choir-master's clothes and wig. It is situated on the Frauenplan next to the ''Bachhaus''.\n* The ''Martin Luther monument'' at Karlsplatz was designed by Adolf von Donndorf and was dedicated on 4 May 1895 on the 374th anniversary of Luther's arrival at Wartburg castle. The more-than-life-size statue of Martin Luther on a pedestal also has reliefs depicting events of his life leading up to and including his stay in Eisenach as well as the title of one of his most famous hymns, \"Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott\" (\"[[A Mighty Fortress Is Our God]]\")\n* The ''Burschenschaftsdenkmal'' (literally: \"Monument to Student Fraternities\") on G\u00f6pelskuppe hill was built in 1902. The monument stands on a hill opposite the Wartburg in memory of the members of the liberal and nationalistic student movement and others who were killed in the struggle for a united Germany between 1864 and 1871.<ref name=\"Baedeker\"/>{{rp|148}} The monument that reaches a height of 33 meters and proclaims \"Honour, Freedom, and Fatherland\", was dedicated on 22 May 1902 and was extended in 1933 to honour those who fell in World War I. Since reunification, fraternities again have been meeting in Eisenach in memory of the demonstrations held at the Wartburg in the past.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Bach-Denkmal Eisenach.jpg|Bach monument\nFile:Martin Luther Eisenach.jpg|Luther monument\nFile:Burschenschaftsdenkmal 07.jpg|''Burschenschaftsdenkmal''\n</gallery>\n\n==== Other sights ====\n* The ''town walls'' were built during the 13th century and demolished in the 19th century. Remains visible today are the ''Nikolaitor'' and the ''Glockenturm''. \n* The ''Kartausgarten'' is all that remains of the original [[Carthusian]] monastery, consecrated to St. Elizabeth in 1380. In 1700 it became a royal kitchen garden and around 1800 was changed into a park. The \"Wandelhalle\" (covered walk and foyer), built in 1906,<ref name=\"Baedeker\"/>{{rp|147}} was originally intended as a pump room to a [[spa]] planned for Eisenach that never materialised.\n* The ''town hall'' at Marktplatz was a former wine cellar and became the townhall of Eisenach in 1596. The building, having been destroyed by fire in 1636, was rebuilt in 1641. The southern part of the complex suffered considerable damage in a bombing raid in 1945 during [[World War II]]. It was renovated in 1996 and it now houses the municipal administration offices. \n* The ''Landestheater'' (state theatre) was established in 1879<ref name=\"Baedeker\"/>{{rp|147}} by Julius von Eichel-Streiber and constructed to the design of the [[Leipzig]] architect Karl Weichardt. It was later renovated in 1993. The theatre holds an audience of 600 and has two balconies. \n* The ''narrow house'' may be the narrowest half-timbered house in Germany. It was built before 1750 and is only 2.05 meters wide. Inside visitors can view a small exhibition. Notably, Bach composed several sonnets here as he liked the acoustics of the house.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Nikolaitor Eisenach.jpg|Town gate ''Nikolaitor''\nFile:ESA Wandelhalle Bild02.jpg|The ''Wandelhalle'' at Kartausgarten\nFile:Eisenach Rathaus.jpg|Town hall\nFile:Landestheater Eisenach.jpg|Theatre\nFile:Eisenach Schmales Haus.jpg|Narrow House\n</gallery>\n\n==Governance==\n\n=== Mayor and town council ===\nThere have been four freely elected mayors after 1990.

Furthermore, there is the [[Eisenach\u2013Lichtenfels railway|Werra Railway]], a former main-line railway between north and south Germany from Eisenach via [[Meiningen]] to [[Eisfeld]], which since the division of Germany after World War II has served only for regional transport. At the former inner German border, it is still interrupted between Eisfeld and [[Coburg]], but rebuilding is in discussion. [[Eisenach station]] is a stop of all long-distance trains from Frankfurt to Leipzig/[[Dresden]], running once an hour. Local trains, also once an hour, start in Eisenach to Halle via Erfurt, to [[Sonneberg]] via Meiningen and Eisfeld and to [[Bebra]] via [[Gerstungen]]. Freight transport is important at Eisenach's Opel factory which has its own terminal. Further local passenger stations are Eisenach-West, Eisenach-Opelwerk and H\u00f6rschel.\n\nEisenach is located on the [[Bundesautobahn 4]] from Frankfurt in the west to Erfurt and Dresden in the east. Since 2010, the Autobahn has been moved to a new route farther away from the town to protect the residents from noise and air pollution. Moreover, it was not possible to expand the old route because of the mountainous topography. After 2010, parts of the old route became a town highway, whereas other parts were renaturalized. A second Autobahn between Eisenach and Kassel is in construction ([[Bundesautobahn 44]]). There are four [[Bundesstra\u00dfe]]n connecting Eisenach: The [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 7]] runs to Kassel in the north-west, whereas its eastern branch to [[Gotha]] was annulled in 2010. The [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 19]] leads to Meiningen in the south, the [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 84]] to [[Bad Langensalza]] in the north-east and to [[Fulda]] via [[Vacha, Germany|Vacha]] in the south-west and the [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 88]] is a connection to [[Ilmenau]] in the south-east. Furthermore, there are two important secondary roads to [[M\u00fchlhausen]] via [[Mihla]] in the north and to [[Herleshausen]] in the west through the H\u00f6rsel valley. Downtown traffic is concentrated on Rennbahn street, which often leads to congestion due to a large number of commuters and the town's narrow topography.\n\nThe next local airports are the [[Erfurt-Weimar Airport]], about {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the east and the [[Kassel Calden Airport]], roughly {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north-west. Both offer service to tourist destinations. The next major international airport is [[Frankfurt Airport]], circa {{convert|200|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-west. Kindel Airfield, {{convert|12|km|0|abbr=on}} east of Eisenach, is a former Soviet military base, today used for private aviation.\n\nBiking is getting more and more popular since the construction of quality cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Long distance trails include the ''Werra trail'', the ''[[Rennsteig]] trail'' and the ''Radweg Th\u00fcringer St\u00e4dtekette'' (\"Thuringian town string trail\"). These all connect points of touristic interest, the first along the [[Werra]] valley from the [[Thuringian Forest]] to the [[Weser]] river in [[Hann. M\u00fcnden]], the second through the Thuringian Forest along its crest to the [[Saale]] river near [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]] and the third follows near the medieval [[Via Regia]] from the Werra valley/Eisenach via Gotha, Erfurt and [[Weimar]] to [[Altenburg]].\n\nPublic transport in Eisenach is by a bus network servicing the downtown areas as well as the neighbouring towns and villages. The three-line tramway system of Eisenach was in operation between 1897 and 1975.\n\n== Education ==\nAfter reunification, the educational system was reformed. Eisenach currently has six state-run and one Protestant primary schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eisenach.de/Grundschulen.528.0.html|title=Allgemeinbildende Schulen|first=Stadt|last=Eisenach|date=16 March 2018|website=eisenach.de|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nThere are two types of secondary school in Germany. The [[Gymnasium (Germany)|gymnasium]] prepares students for higher education at a university and students graduate after a total of 12 or 13 years of education with an [[Abitur]]. There are two public and one evangelical gymnasium in Eisenach named after personalities of the cities history:<ref><http://www.eisenach.de/Gymnasien.530.0.html</ref>\n* ''Elisabeth Gymnasium'' (named after [[Elizabeth of Hungary|St. Elisabeth]].

There are four public and one free sponsored ''Realschulen'' in Eisenach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eisenach.de/Regelschulen.529.0.html|title=Allgemeinbildende Schulen|first=Stadt|last=Eisenach|date=16 March 2018|website=eisenach.de|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, there is one [[Waldorf education|Waldorf]] school where education spans from primary school to gymnasium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waldorfschule-eisenach.de|title=Start - Freie Waldorfschule Eisenach|author=|date=|website=www.waldorfschule-eisenach.de|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, the ''[[Cooperative education|Berufsakademie]] Eisenach'' was founded.

From 1991 to 1994, she had a recurring role as Reed, the daughter of Alex ([[Swoosie Kurtz]]), on the NBC drama ''[[Sisters (U.S. TV series)|Sisters]]''. She made her feature film debut with a small role in 1992's ''[[Kuffs]]''. In 1993, Judd fought for and was cast in her first starring role playing the title character in [[Victor Nu\u00f1ez]]'s [[Sundance Film Festival]] Grand Jury Prize dramatic winner ''[[Ruby in Paradise]]''. Convinced that this role would shape the rest of her career, Judd was extremely nervous for the audition, nearly getting into a car accident en route. \"From the first three sentences, I knew it was written for me\", she told the ''San Jose Mercury News''.<ref>Lovell, Glenn. San Jose Mercury News, November 8, 1993</ref> She received rave reviews playing Ruby Lee Gissing, a young woman trying to make a new life for herself, and it was this performance that would launch her career as an actress. Nu\u00f1ez told author James L. Dickerson that the resonance of the character was Judd's creation: \"The resonance, those moments, was not contrived. It was just a matter of creating the scene and trusting that it was worth telling.\"<ref>Dickerson, James L. Ashley Judd:Crying on the Inside, Schirmer Trade Books, 2002, p. 75</ref>\n\n[[Oliver Stone]], who had seen her in Nu\u00f1ez's film, cast Judd in ''[[Natural Born Killers]]'', but her scenes were later cut from the version of the film released theatrically.

In 1996, she co-starred with [[Mira Sorvino]] as [[Marilyn Monroe]] in ''[[Norma Jean and Marilyn]]'', where she recreated the photo shoot for the centerfold for the first issue of ''[[Playboy]]''. The same year she had a supporting role in the court room thriller film ''[[A Time to Kill (1996 film)|A Time to Kill]]'' (1996) which received positive reviews and was a major box office success.

From 1991 to 1994, she had a recurring role as Reed, the daughter of Alex ([[Swoosie Kurtz]]), on the NBC drama ''[[Sisters (U.S. TV series)|Sisters]]''. She made her feature film debut with a small role in 1992's ''[[Kuffs]]''. In 1993, Judd fought for and was cast in her first starring role playing the title character in [[Victor Nu\u00f1ez]]'s [[Sundance Film Festival]] Grand Jury Prize dramatic winner ''[[Ruby in Paradise]]''. Convinced that this role would shape the rest of her career, Judd was extremely nervous for the audition, nearly getting into a car accident en route. \"From the first three sentences, I knew it was written for me\", she told the ''San Jose Mercury News''.<ref>Lovell, Glenn. San Jose Mercury News, November 8, 1993</ref> She received rave reviews playing Ruby Lee Gissing, a young woman trying to make a new life for herself, and it was this performance that would launch her career as an actress. Nu\u00f1ez told author James L. Dickerson that the resonance of the character was Judd's creation: \"The resonance, those moments, was not contrived. It was just a matter of creating the scene and trusting that it was worth telling.\"<ref>Dickerson, James L. Ashley Judd:Crying on the Inside, Schirmer Trade Books, 2002, p. 75</ref>\n\n[[Oliver Stone]], who had seen her in Nu\u00f1ez's film, cast Judd in ''[[Natural Born Killers]]'', but her scenes were later cut from the version of the film released theatrically.

In 1996, she co-starred with [[Mira Sorvino]] as [[Marilyn Monroe]] in ''[[Norma Jean and Marilyn]]'', where she recreated the photo shoot for the centerfold for the first issue of ''[[Playboy]]''. The same year she had a supporting role in the court room thriller film ''[[A Time to Kill (1996 film)|A Time to Kill]]'' (1996) which received positive reviews and was a major box office success. By the end of the 1990s, Judd had managed to achieve significant fame and success as a leading actress, after leading roles in several thrillers that performed well at the box office, including ''[[Kiss the Girls (1997 film)|Kiss the Girls]]'' in 1997 and 1999's ''[[Double Jeopardy (1999 film)|Double Jeopardy]]''.\n\nIn early 2000s she starred in ''[[Where the Heart Is (2000 film)|Where the Heart Is]]'' (2000), ''[[Someone Like You (film)|Someone Like You]]'' (2001), and ''[[High Crimes]]'' (2002).

Night and weekend service varies between 8 and 20 minutes, with trains generally scheduled only every 20 minutes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wmata.com/schedules/timetables/|title=Rail Schedules|publisher=WMATA|access-date=January 24, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOther service truncations also occur in the system during rush hour service only.

Rush Plus service occurred only during portions of peak service: 6:30\u20139:00 AM and 3:30\u20136:00 PM, Monday through Friday.\n\nThe Rush+ realignment was intended to free up space in the Rosslyn Portal (the tunnel between Rosslyn and Foggy Bottom), which operates at full capacity already. When Silver Line service began, those trains would be routed through the tunnel, and so some of what were Blue Line trains to {{wmata|Largo Town Center}} were now diverted across the [[14th Street Bridges|Fenwick Bridge]] to become Yellow Line trains running all the way to the Green Line to {{wmata|Greenbelt}}. Select Yellow Line trains running south diverted along the Blue Line to {{wmata|Franconia\u2013Springfield}} (as opposed to the normal Yellow line terminus at {{wmata|Huntington}}). Until the start of Silver Line service, excess Rosslyn Tunnel capacity was used by additional Orange Line trains that traveled along the Blue Line to Largo (as opposed to the normal Orange Line terminus at {{wmata|New Carrollton}}). Rush+ had the additional effect of giving some further number of passengers transfer-free journeys, though severely increasing headways for the portion of the Blue Line running between {{wmata|Pentagon}} and {{wmata|Rosslyn}}. In May 2017, Metro announced that Yellow Rush+ service would be eliminated effective June 25, 2017.<ref>{{cite web|title=Metro announces June 25 effective date for new hours, fares, schedules|url=https://www.wmata.com/about/news/06-17_Metro_Fare_and_Service_Changes.cfm|publisher=WMATA|accessdate=June 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Passenger information systems ===\n[[File:Gallery Pl-Chinatown Upper Level January 28, 2010.jpg|thumb|right|PIDS signs at the {{wmata|Gallery Place}} station]][[File:WMATA King Street PIDS.jpg|thumb|right|Digital PIDS signs at the {{wmata|King Street}} station]]\nA [[Passenger information system|Passenger Information Display System]] (PIDS) was installed in all Metrorail stations in 2000.

Rush Plus service occurred only during portions of peak service: 6:30\u20139:00 AM and 3:30\u20136:00 PM, Monday through Friday.\n\nThe Rush+ realignment was intended to free up space in the Rosslyn Portal (the tunnel between Rosslyn and Foggy Bottom), which operates at full capacity already. When Silver Line service began, those trains would be routed through the tunnel, and so some of what were Blue Line trains to {{wmata|Largo Town Center}} were now diverted across the [[14th Street Bridges|Fenwick Bridge]] to become Yellow Line trains running all the way to the Green Line to {{wmata|Greenbelt}}. Select Yellow Line trains running south diverted along the Blue Line to {{wmata|Franconia\u2013Springfield}} (as opposed to the normal Yellow line terminus at {{wmata|Huntington}}). Until the start of Silver Line service, excess Rosslyn Tunnel capacity was used by additional Orange Line trains that traveled along the Blue Line to Largo (as opposed to the normal Orange Line terminus at {{wmata|New Carrollton}}). Rush+ had the additional effect of giving some further number of passengers transfer-free journeys, though severely increasing headways for the portion of the Blue Line running between {{wmata|Pentagon}} and {{wmata|Rosslyn}}. In May 2017, Metro announced that Yellow Rush+ service would be eliminated effective June 25, 2017.<ref>{{cite web|title=Metro announces June 25 effective date for new hours, fares, schedules|url=https://www.wmata.com/about/news/06-17_Metro_Fare_and_Service_Changes.cfm|publisher=WMATA|accessdate=June 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Passenger information systems ===\n[[File:Gallery Pl-Chinatown Upper Level January 28, 2010.jpg|thumb|right|PIDS signs at the {{wmata|Gallery Place}} station]][[File:WMATA King Street PIDS.jpg|thumb|right|Digital PIDS signs at the {{wmata|King Street}} station]]\nA [[Passenger information system|Passenger Information Display System]] (PIDS) was installed in all Metrorail stations in 2000.
