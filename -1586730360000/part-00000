It is the first main entry in the [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]] since 1999's ''[[Grand Theft Auto 2]]''. Set within the fictional Liberty City, loosely based on [[New York City]], the game follows a criminal named [[Claude (Grand Theft Auto)|Claude]] after he is left for dead and quickly becomes entangled in a world of gangs, crime and corruption. The game is played from a [[Third-person (video games)|third-person perspective]] and its world is navigated on foot or by vehicle. The [[open world]] design lets players freely roam the three islands of Liberty City.\n\nDevelopment was shared between DMA Design, based in [[Edinburgh]], and Rockstar, based in [[New York City]]. Much of the development work involved transforming popular elements from the ''Grand Theft Auto'' series into a fully 3D world for the first time. The game was delayed following the [[September 11 attacks]] to allow the team to change references and gameplay deemed inappropriate. It was released in October 2001 for the [[PlayStation 2]], in May 2002 for [[Microsoft Windows]], and in October 2003 for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]].\n\nUpon release, ''Grand Theft Auto III'' received critical acclaim, with praise particularly directed at its concept and gameplay. However, the game also generated controversy, with criticism directed at its depictions of violence and sex. It became the [[best-selling video game]] of 2001, and has sold over 14.5 million copies since. Considered by many critics as one of the most significant titles of the [[Sixth generation of video game consoles|sixth generation of video games]], and one of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games of all time]], it won a number of year-end accolades, including [[Game of the Year]] awards from several [[Video game journalism|gaming publications]]. Since its release, it has received [[Porting|ports]] to many different gaming platforms. An enhanced version of the game was released on [[mobile platforms]] in 2011, for the game's tenth anniversary. Its successor, ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]]'', was released in October 2002, and two prequels, ''[[Grand Theft Auto Advance|Advance]]'' and ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories|Liberty City Stories]]'', were released in 2004 and 2005, respectively.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Gta3-pc-walking.jpeg|left|thumb|Players can freely roam the game's world and have the ability to use weapons to accomplish tasks.]]\n''Grand Theft Auto III'' is an [[action-adventure game]] played from a [[third-person perspective]]. Players complete missions\u2014linear scenarios with set objectives\u2014to progress through the story.<ref name=\"IGN Review\" /> It is possible to have several active missions running at one time, as some missions require players to wait for further instructions or events.<ref name=\"IGN Benzies DMA\" /> Outside of missions, players can [[Nonlinear gameplay|freely roam]] the game's [[open world]], and have the ability to complete optional side missions. Liberty City is composed of three boroughs: Portland, Staunton Island, and Shoreside Vale; the latter two areas become unlocked as the story progresses.<ref name=\"IGN Benzies\" />\n\nPlayers may run, jump or use vehicles to navigate the game's world.<ref name=\"IGN Cars\" /> In combat, [[auto-aim]] can be used as assistance against enemies.<ref name=\"GameSpot Hands-On\" /> Should players take damage, their health meter can be fully regenerated through the use of health pick-ups. [[Personal armor|Body armour]] can be used to absorb gunshots and explosive damage, but is used up in the process.{{sfn|DMA Design|2001|p=12}} When health is entirely depleted, gameplay stops and players [[Spawning (video game)|respawn]] at the nearest hospital, at the expense of losing armour and an amount of money.<ref name=\"GameRev Review\" />\n\nIf players commit crimes while playing, the game's law enforcement agencies may respond as indicated by a \"[[Fugitive|wanted]]\" meter in the [[HUD (video gaming)|head-up display]] (HUD). On the meter, the displayed stars indicate the current wanted level<ref name=\"AllGame Review\" /> (for example, at the maximum six-star level, efforts by law enforcement to incapacitate players become very aggressive).{{sfn|DMA Design|2001|p=11}} Law enforcement officers will search for players who leave the wanted vicinity. The wanted meter enters a [[cooldown]] mode and eventually recedes when players are hidden from the officers' line of sight.<ref name=\"AllGame Review\" />\n\nThe game lets players control the [[Muteness|mute]] criminal [[Claude (Grand Theft Auto)|Claude]].<ref name=\"Q-A\" /> During the story, Claude meets various new characters from gangs. As players complete missions for different gangs, fellow gang members will often defend players, while rival gang members will recognise players and subsequently shoot on sight.<ref name=\"IGN Gangs\" /> While free roaming the game world, players may engage in activities such as a [[vigilante]] minigame, a [[fire fighting]] activity, a paramedic service and a [[taxi cab]] service.<ref name=\"AllGame Review\" /><ref name=\"IGN Hood\" /> Completion of these activities grants players with context-specific rewards; for example, completing the vigilante mission allows players to [[bribe]] police after committing a crime.<ref name=\"1UP Essential\" />\n\n[[File:GTAIII PS2 Beta Drive-by.jpg|thumb|right|Combat in ''Grand Theft Auto III'' was reworked to allow players to perform [[drive-by shooting]]s by viewing sideways in a car.]]\n\nPlayers use [[Melee#Use in gaming|melee]] attacks, firearms and explosives to fight enemies. The firearms include weapons such as the [[Micro Uzi]], an [[M16 rifle]] and a [[flamethrower]].<ref name=\"IGN Benzies\" /> The game's three-dimension environment allows a [[first-person view]] while aiming with the [[sniper rifle]], [[rocket launcher]] and the [[M16 rifle]]. In addition, the game's combat was reworked to allow players to commit [[drive-by shooting]]s by facing sideways in a vehicle.<ref name=\"IGN Review\" /> The game gives players a wide variety of weapon options\u2014they can be purchased from local [[firearms dealer]]s, found on the ground, retrieved from dead enemies, or found around the city.{{sfn|DMA Design|2001|p=12}}\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 2001, small-time criminal [[Claude (Grand Theft Auto)|Claude]] is shot and betrayed by his girlfriend Catalina during a bank heist outside Liberty City. Although he survives, Claude is arrested and sentenced to prison. However, while being transferred, the Colombian Cartel ambush his prison transport in order to secure one of the other prisoners on it. In the chaos, Claude escapes alongside 8-Ball, a bombs expert, and goes into hiding within Portland. Introduced by 8-Ball to the Leone [[American Mafia|Mafia]] family, Claude works with several of its members, becoming slowly involved in a war between them and the [[Triad (organized crime)|Triads]]. He ultimately gains the respect of [[Crime boss|Don]] Salvatore Leone, who asks him to help with the war, and eventually in dealing with the Cartel by destroying a ship they are using to manufacture a new street drug. After the job is completed, Claude is warned by Salvatore's [[trophy wife]], Maria, whom he met while looking after her for Salvatore, that he has become paranoid and plans to kill him.\n\nAided by Maria's friend Asuka Kasen, co-leader of the [[Yakuza]], the pair escape to Staunton Island, whereupon Claude is asked to cut his ties to the Leones by killing Salvatore. Claude begins working for the Yakuza, taking jobs from Asuka and her brother Kenji. During this time, he also works for corrupt LCPD detective Ray Machowski, and media mogul Donald Love, who asks Claude to rescue the prisoner the Cartel abducted, and assassinate Kenji in order to start a war between the Yakuza and the Cartel. Eventually, Claude takes on a job that leads to him confronting Catalina, only for her to escape, leaving behind her partner Miguel. Asuka secures him for interrogation over Kenji's death, asking Claude to help her hit the Cartel's operations on the assumption they had her brother murdered.\n\nClaude's attacks on the Cartel eventually attract Catalina's wrath, who murders Asuka and Miguel, and kidnaps Maria, demanding a $500,000 ransom for her. When Claude meets with Catalina to give her the money, she double-crosses him and leaves him for dead again. After escaping, Claude pursues Catalina who attempts to leave by helicopter, saving Maria and killing Catalina for good. As Claude and Maria flee the scene, the latter begins to complain about her kidnapping and the state of her appearance. As the credits roll and the scene blacks out, a gunshot is heard and Maria's voice is silenced.{{efn|The sound of a gunshot, and the silencing of Maria's voice, has led to speculation that Claude fired the shot to kill Maria or just to silence her. Rockstar has refused to confirm this.<ref name=\"Q-A\"/>}}\n\n== Development ==\nThe core development team of ''Grand Theft Auto III'' consisted of about 23 people at [[DMA Design]] in [[Edinburgh]], who worked closely with publisher [[Rockstar Games]] in [[New York City]].<ref name=\"IGN Benzies\" /> By early 2001, the team had designed the city, cars, and some weapons.<ref name=\"GameSpot Dan\" /> An [[online multiplayer]] mode was initially planned for the game, but was ultimately dropped due to time and resource limitations.{{sfn|Crookes|2013|pp=58\u201363}} Producer [[Leslie Benzies]] described ''Grand Theft Auto III'' as a \"crime simulation game\".<ref name=\"IGN Benzies\" /> The game was released for the [[PlayStation 2]] on 22 October 2001 in North America.<ref name=\"IGN Characters\" /> When porting the game to [[Microsoft Windows]], the team delayed it from the PlayStation 2 release in order to ensure quality, citing issues with the simultaneous platform release of previous ''Grand Theft Auto'' games.<ref name=\"PC Interview\" />\n\n=== Open world design ===\n[[File:Gta3-pc-stealing.jpeg|right|thumb|''Grand Theft Auto III'' is the first game in the series to use a [[Third-person (video games)|third-person perspective]] view model, positioning the [[Virtual camera system|camera]] closer to the player character.]]\n\n''Grand Theft Auto III'' is considered to be the first 3D game in the series,{{sfn|Kushner|2012|pp=81\u201382}} using [[Criterion Games]]' [[RenderWare]] [[game engine]].<ref name=\"PC Graphics\" /> When designing the game, the development team expanded upon concepts introduced in the previous ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' games. Benzies stated that the intention was to recreate the \"freedom and diversity\" of the previous games in a \"living, breathing 3D world\", using the power of the PlayStation 2 to do so.<ref name=\"IGN Benzies\" /> The console's ability to use [[DVD]]s, an improvement over the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]'s limit to [[CD]]s, allowed the team to store more data, such as animations, music and environments.{{sfn|Kushner|2012|p=81}} Despite this, the team found it difficult to fit the game into the PlayStation 2's 32 megabytes of [[RAM]], due to the scale. The game's size also created difficulties for the testers, due to the variety of options.<ref name=\"IGN Benzies DMA\" /> Benzies felt that creating a living city was the \"underlying principle\" of the game's concept during development.<ref name=\"IGN Benzies\" /> Executive producer [[Sam Houser]] felt that the game's 3D element allowed the \"chemistry of the team [to come] together perfectly for the first time\".<ref name=\"1UP Sam\" />\n\nA major difficulty the team encountered was converting all game elements into a fully 3D world, including the sound and radio stations, as well as designing and voicing the non-player characters, due to the amount that existed within the open world;<ref name=\"IGN Dan\" /> producer [[Dan Houser]] said that there was about 8,000 lines of recorded dialogue in the game,<ref name=\"IGN Dan\" /> while audio programmer Raymond Usher estimated about 18,000.<ref name=\"Sound Usher\" /> The basic technical elements of the game began to work together in mid-2000, with a carjacking mechanic prototype and stable [[Stream (computing)|streaming]] model.<ref name=\"IGN How2\" /> Streaming was initially intended to be reserved for music and map geometry, but other elements were eventually included when it became apparent to the team as more data was entered.<ref name=\"IGN Benzies DMA\" />\n\nWhen designing the game world, the team initially created a \"hybrid city\", which producer [[Dan Houser]] describes as \"a post industrial [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] slash [[East Coast of the United States|east coast]] generic\" city.<ref name=\"IGN Dan 2\" /> Upon developing within this game world, the team realised that basing the design on a real location meant \"you have a lot of things you can say about it\".<ref name=\"IGN Dan 2\" /> As a result, the team redesigned Liberty City, which had been previously featured in ''[[Grand Theft Auto (video game)|Grand Theft Auto]]'' (1997), basing it loosely on [[New York City]].<ref name=\"IGN Dan 2\" /> The city is broken into three islands: an industrial section representing [[Brooklyn]] and [[Queens]], a commercial centre resembling [[Manhattan]], and suburbs similar to [[New Jersey]].{{sfn|Kushner|2012|p=83}} The islands unlock as the story progresses; the team wanted players to \"start out feeling poor and work to being richer\".<ref name=\"EW Dan\" /> Dan Houser describes Liberty City as a \"hybrid of a generic American city\", including [[Chicago]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Detroit]], New York, and [[Philadelphia]].<ref name=\"EW Dan\" /> He felt that the parallel realism of the world allowed the team to make more social commentary than previously.{{sfn|Crookes|2013|pp=58\u201363}} Sam Houser cited films and shows like ''[[Heat (1995 film)|Heat]]'' (1995) and ''[[The Sopranos]]'' (1999\u20132007) as inspiration for the setting, and wanted to emulate them in the game.{{sfn|Kushner|2012|p=82}} He also cited the influence of ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' and the film ''[[Goodfellas]]'' (1990), describing ''Grand Theft Auto III'' as \"a cross between a gangster movie and an RPG\".<ref name=\"IGN Sam\" /><ref name=\"Americana\">{{cite interview |title=Americana at Its Most Felonious: Q. and A.: Rockstar\u2019s Dan Houser on Grand Theft Auto V |interviewer=Chris Suellentrop |first=Dan |last=Houser |subjectlink=Dan Houser |date=9 November 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/10/arts/video-games/q-and-a-rockstars-dan-houser-on-grand-theft-auto-v.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=30 July 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110091527/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/10/arts/video-games/q-and-a-rockstars-dan-houser-on-grand-theft-auto-v.html |archivedate=10 November 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Story and characters ===\n{{Main|List of Grand Theft Auto III characters}}\nThe team developed the story and design simultaneously. \"We use the story to expose the mechanics, and we use the mechanics to tell the story,\" said Dan Houser.<ref name=\"GameSpot Dan\" /> Houser found it difficult to create the narrative, as the game is so strongly focused on player freedom. He wanted the story to be more nuanced and interesting than the generic \"rise and fall and rise again of a superhero bad guy\".<ref name=\"EW Dan\" /> The game's script was also focused on mission objectives, attempting to implement high amounts of interactivity.<ref name=\"IGN How2\" /> Houser felt that each mission is \"its own short story\", and part of an \"overarching story\".<ref name=\"GameSpot Dan\" /> Houser and co-writer James Worrall drew influence from mob films, and the mafiosi featured in films by [[Martin Scorsese]]. When writing the story, Houser and Worrall regularly met with the designers, and filled a room with [[post-it note]]s to reconstruct the story components to shape the game.<ref name=\"IGN How2\" />\n\nMany of the game characters were animated using [[motion capture]], filmed at a rented studio at the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]],{{sfn|Kushner|2012|p=82}} though this was limited by technical restraints. The character movement was also treated as being cinematic, though limited [[Polygon (computer graphics)|polygons]] heavily inhibited this.<ref name=\"IGN How3\" /> Animating [[non-player character]]s entering and driving cars proved to be difficult for the team, due to the variety of vehicle designs. \"It involved chaining together dozens of different animations and altering key frames in code,\" recalled software engineer [[Alan Campbell (writer)|Alan Campbell]].{{sfn|Crookes|2013|pp=58\u201363}} The team used varying camera angles when animating the game's cutscenes, in order to evoke different emotions.<ref name=\"IGN Cinematic\" /> For the voice acting, the team wanted \"natural, subtle performances\", which proved difficult as many of the actors \"had in their head the idea that because video games are animated their performances needed to be animated\", explained motion capture director [[Navid Khonsari]].<ref name=\"IGN How3\" /> The game's playable protagonist is unnamed in the game,<ref name=\"IGN Characters\" /> and his name is not officially revealed as [[Claude (Grand Theft Auto)|Claude]] until his appearance in ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' (2004). He is a [[silent protagonist]], never speaking throughout his appearances. The team decided to make Claude silent primarily because it \"did not seem like a major issue\", due to the other challenges faced during development, and also partly to allow players to identify with the character, as the character will be who the players want him to be.<ref name=\"Q-A\" />\n\n=== Sound design ===\n''Grand Theft Auto III'' features about three-and-a-half hours of in-game radio material. For the music, the team sought a broad diversity, to recreate the real sensation of skipping through radio stations, reflecting the [[Mob film|gangster movie]] culture invoked by the game. The team used the talk radio stations to add character to the city, and provide a \"unique take on American life\";<ref name=\"IGN Sounds3\" /> Sam Houser described it as \"a very iconoclastic look at America\".<ref name=\"IGN Sam\" /> The team used real [[Disc jockey|DJs]] to portray those on the radio. In doing so, the team wrote unusual dialogue for the DJs, seeking the effect of \"high production values and absurd content\". Music director Craig Conner assembled the assets of the radio station\u2014music, advertisements, DJ dialogue, station imaging.<ref name=\"IGN Sounds3\" />\n\n=== Cuts and changes ===\n{{Multiple image|align=right|direction=horizontal|total_width=500|image1=GTAIII LCPD copcar change.jpg|caption1=After the events of [[9/11]], the original colour scheme of the police cars in the game (top), which resembled the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]], was changed to a generic black-and-white design common in the United States.|image2=GTA3 UK Cover.jpg|caption2=The original artwork for the game, which was changed after the events of 9/11.<ref name=\"Questions 2\"/> This artwork was still used as the cover in Europe.<ref name=\"Edge LCS\"/>}}\n\n{{Quote|quote=[W]e felt that a full content review of all our titles and the marketing materials we use to represent them was absolutely necessary for us ... we have come across certain small contextual references that we were no longer comfortable with, as well as a couple of very rare gameplay instances that no longer felt appropriate to us.|author=Terry Donovan, Rockstar managing director|source=IGN, 19 September 2001<ref name=\"911 Delay\"/>}}\n\nPrior to the initial release, several modifications were made to the game. While changes are frequent during [[game development]], the changes in ''Grand Theft Auto III'' were noted to be around the time of the [[September 11 attacks]], which led to speculation that some changes were motivated by the attacks. On 19 September 2001, Rockstar delayed the game's release by three weeks, citing the attacks as an influencing factor in the delay.<ref name=\"911 Delay\" /> \"Everyone had someone who had an uncle or brother [who was impacted by the attack]\", said [[Paul Eibeler]], then-president of distributor [[Take-Two Interactive]].{{sfn|Kushner|2012|p=98}}\n\nOne of the changes made shortly after the September 11 attacks was the colour scheme of the [[police cars]]; the original colour scheme of blue with white stripes specifically resembled that of the [[New York City Police Department]]. It was changed to black-and-white designs common among several police departments in the United States, such as [[Los Angeles Police Department|Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco Police Department|San Francisco]]. Other changes include altering the flight path of a plane to avoid appearing to fly into or behind a skyscraper, removing a mission referencing terrorists, as well as some changes to pedestrian dialogue and talk radio.<ref name=\"Eurogamer 911\" /> Another cut to the game is the character of Darkel, a revolutionary urchin who vowed to bring down the city's economy. When references to Darkel were found in the game's code, speculation arose that the character was related to 9/11, however Dan Houser explained that the character had been cut \"months before [release]\".<ref name=\"Eurogamer 911\" /> There are also reports and previews stating that the game featured school children as pedestrians prior to release,<ref name=\"GameSpot Impressions\" /> although Rockstar has dismissed such rumours as \"nonsense\".<ref name=\"Questions 2\" />\n\nRockstar stated that the game was \"about 1% different\" after 9/11, and that the biggest change was the cover art. They felt that the original cover, which was ultimately released as the cover in Europe, felt \"too raw\" after 9/11, and was changed into what became the \"signature style\" of the series.<ref name=\"Questions 2\" /> Sam Houser claimed that the cover was designed in an evening, and was instantly preferred over the original cover.<ref name=\"Edge LCS\" /> The cover was inspired by the movie posters for 1960s films, such as ''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1968 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]'' (1968).<ref name=\"Questions 2\" />\n\n== Critical reception ==\n=== Initial release ===\n{{Video game reviews\n| title   = PlayStation 2 version reception\n| MC      = 97/100<ref name=\"MC\"/>\n| 1UP     = A+<ref name=\"1UP Review\"/>\n| Allgame = {{rating|5|5}}<ref name=\"AllGame Review\"/>\n| Edge    = 8/10<ref name=\"Edge Review\"/>\n| EuroG   = 10/10<ref name=\"Eurogamer Review\"/>\n| GamePro = 5/5<ref name=\"GamePro Review\"/>\n| GameRev = A<ref name=\"GameRev Review\"/>\n| GI      = 9.5/10<ref name=\"Game Informer Review\"/>\n| GSpot   = 9.6/10<ref name=\"GameSpot Review\"/>\n| GSpy    = 94/100<ref name=\"GameSpy Review\"/>\n| IGN     = 9.6/10<ref name=\"IGN Review\"/>\n}}\n''Grand Theft Auto III'' was released to critical acclaim.

[[GameSpy]] awarded ''Grand Theft Auto III'' with Most Offensive Game of the Year, calling it \"absolutely reprehensible\".<ref name=\"GameSpy Offensive\" /> They wrote that the game rewards players for \"causing mayhem\" and \"killing innocent people by the dozen\", ultimately questioning its appropriateness within the industry.<ref name=\"GameSpy Offensive\" /> The notoriety of ''Grand Theft Auto III'' resulted in [[Wal-Mart]]'s decision to check the identification of purchasers who appeared to be under the age of 17, when purchasing mature titles.<ref name=\"IGN History2\" /> In an essay, assistant professor Shira Chess identified the lack of conclusion to player violence, due to the ability to respawn upon death or incarceration, and found that it denies the \"reality of mortality and simultaneously [forces] it on players\".{{sfn|Chess|2006|pp=80\u201390}} When speaking about the game's depiction of violence, producer Leslie Benzies claims that is intended as comedic, and that the game is \"not meant to be taken seriously\".<ref name=\"IGN Benzies\" /> Producer Dan Houser stated that the team was conscious of the offence that the game would attract, but \"never marketed it in a way that exploited that\".<ref name=\"IGN Dan\" />\n\nThe game allows players to participate in sexual activities with prostitutes, and murder them to reclaim the payment. This was met with widespread controversy.<ref name=\"Telegraph Memorable\" /> The game also received controversy for its depiction of crime, and allowing violence against police officers. Psychologist [[David Walsh (psychologist)|David Walsh]] of the [[National Institute on Media and the Family]] stated that the game \"glamorizes antisocial and criminal activity\",<ref name=\"USAToday Glorifies\" /> and that \"the purpose of the game is to perpetrate crime\".<ref name=\"Kotaku Scapegoat\" /> In response, ''[[Kotaku]]'' writer Owen Good wrote that the game does not reward players for \"proficiency at crime, no matter how much it is accused of doing so\".<ref name=\"Kotaku Scapegoat\" /> Joanna Weiss of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' noted the \"adrenaline\" that players feel when committing crimes in the game, excusing the game's violence due to its mature classification.<ref name=\"Boston Globe\" /> The [[National Organization for Women]] spoke out against the game in January 2002, asking Rockstar and Take-Two to withdraw the game from sale as it \"encourages violence and the degradation of women\".<ref name=\"Morality\" /> [[Matt Richtel]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that the activities within the game \"crossed the line into bad taste\".<ref name=\"NYT\" />\n\n''Grand Theft Auto III'' was initially released in Australia with an MA15+ classification. After re-reviewing the game, the [[Australian Classification Board|Office of Film and Literature Classification]] (OFLC) [[List of banned video games in Australia|banned it]], due to its depiction of sexual content and violence to prostitutes.<ref name=\"GameSpot Aus Ban\" /><ref name=\"GameSpot Aus\" /> This prompted distributor Take-Two Interactive to appeal to the OFLC, who reaffirmed the banned status on 11 December 2001, after reanalysing the game and seeking the professional opinion of a forensic psychologist. This prompted Take-Two to recall the game in Australia, and Rockstar to make appropriate changes to the game; a modified version was re-released with an MA15+ classification in January 2002, removing all instances of sexual acts with prostitutes.<ref name=\"GameSpot Aus\" /> The game was re-rated with an R18+ classification in September 2019, citing \"sexual activities related to incentives and rewards\".<ref name=\"Kotaku Aus\" />\n\nOn 25 June 2003, teenage stepbrothers William and Josh Buckner shot and killed Aaron Hamel and Kimberly Bede. In statements to investigators, the perpretators claimed their actions were inspired by ''Grand Theft Auto III''. In response, on 20 October 2003, the families of Hamel and Bede filed a US$246 million lawsuit against Rockstar Games, Take-Two Interactive, [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] and [[Wal-Mart]].<ref name=\"CNN Lawsuit\" /> Rockstar and Take-Two filed for dismissal of the lawsuit, stating in [[United States district court]] on 29 October 2003 that the \"ideas and concepts\", and the \"purported psychological effects\" of the perpetrators, are protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]'s free-speech clause.<ref name=\"GameSpot dismiss\" /> [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]], the lawyer representing the victims, denied Rockstar's claims, and attempted to move the lawsuit into a state court for consideration under Tennessee's consumer protection act.<ref name=\"GameSpot dismiss\" />\n\n== Legacy ==\n''Grand Theft Auto III'' has been frequently included among the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games of all time]].<ref name=\"Greatest\" /> In 2007, [[GamePro]] called ''Grand Theft Auto III'' the most important video game of all time, explaining that the \"game's open-ended gameplay elements have revolutionized the way all video games are made\".<ref name=\"GamePro\" /> Similarly, IGN ranked the game among the Top 10 Most Influential Games,<ref name=\"IGN Influential\" /> and GameSpot listed among the greatest games of all time.<ref name=\"GameSpot Greatest\" /> In 2009, ''Game Informer'' wrote that ''Grand Theft Auto III'' \"changed the gaming landscape forever with its immersive open world sandbox\",{{sfn|Game Informer|2009|pp=44\u201379}} and in 2016 [[GamesRadar]] named it \"the most important game of the decade\".<ref name=\"GamesRadar Decade\" /> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' named it one of the greatest video games of all time in November 2012<ref name=\"Time Magazine\" /> and August 2016.<ref name=\"Time Magazine 2\" />\n\n''Grand Theft Auto III'' is considered to have a leading role in the popularisation of [[sandbox game]]s, inspiring those such as ''[[True Crime (series)|True Crime]]'' (2003\u201305), ''[[Saints Row]]'' (2006\u2013present) and ''[[Crackdown]]'' (2007).<ref name=\"IGN Influential\" /> The term \"[[Grand Theft Auto clone|''Grand Theft Auto'' clone]]\" is frequently used to describe subsequent video games released with similar open-ended gameplay as ''Grand Theft Auto III''.<ref name=\"GTA Clone\" /> While previous video games used open world design, including earlier ''Grand Theft Auto'' games, ''Grand Theft Auto III'' took this gameplay foundation and expanded it into a 3D world,<ref name=\"GameSpot Greatest\" /> offering an unprecedented variety of minigames and side-missions.<ref name=\"IGN Influential\" /> Due to the greater success of the game over its predecessors, it is credited with popularising the open-world genre;<ref name=\"DMA\" /> Dan Houser felt that the game made it \"one of the most vibrant genres today\".<ref name=\"GameSpot Dan\" />\n\nThe game also led the trend of mature video games; Dan Houser felt that it allowed other developers to create violent shooters.<ref name=\"IGN Delighted\" /> [[Hal Halpin]], president of the [[Entertainment Consumers Association]], described ''Grand Theft Auto III'' as the \"lightning rod for the violence-in-games debate\".<ref name=\"1UP Legacy\" /> ''[[Metro (magazine)|Metro]]''{{'}}s Roger Hargreaves wrote that it \"emboldened a whole new wave of games that were ... fixated with violence, gang culture\".<ref name=\"Metro Midweek\" /> Greg Ford of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' felt that the game allowed the medium to handle mature subject matter in a more serious manner than previously perceived, and noted the improvement of video game classification as a result of the game's controversy.<ref name=\"1UP Legacy\" />\n\nFollowing the game's success, Rockstar developed further titles in the series. ''Vice City'' and ''San Andreas'' are set in their titular locations in 1986 and 1992, respectively.<ref name=\"Vice City\" /><ref name=\"San Andreas\" /> ''[[Grand Theft Auto (Game Boy Advance)|Grand Theft Auto Advance]]'' (2004) is set in Liberty City roughly one year before the events of ''Grand Theft Auto III''.<ref name=\"Advance\" /> ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories]]'' (2005) takes place three years before the events of ''Grand Theft Auto III'' in the same rendition of Liberty City.<ref name=\"Trilogy\" /> A completely redesigned version of the city was later used in ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'' (2008),<ref name=\"GTA IV\" /> ''[[Grand Theft Auto: The Lost and Damned|The Lost and Damned]]'' (2009),<ref name=\"Lost and Damned\" /> ''[[Grand Theft Auto: The Ballad of Gay Tony|The Ballad of Gay Tony]]'' (2009)<ref name=\"Ballad of Gay Tony\" /> and ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars|Chinatown Wars]]'' (2009).<ref name=\"Chinatown Wars\" />\n\n=== Ports and remakes ===\n''Grand Theft Auto III'' was released on 21 May 2002 for [[Microsoft Windows]], supporting higher screen resolutions and draw distance, and featuring more detailed textures.<ref name=\"PC\" /> A [[GameCube]] release was planned, but later cancelled.<ref name=\"GameCube\" /> In December 2003, the game was released on the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], with its sequel ''Vice City'' in a compilation titled ''Grand Theft Auto: Double Pack''.

[[action-adventure game]] developed by [[DMA Design]] and published by [[Rockstar Games]]. It is the first main entry in the [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]] since 1999's ''[[Grand Theft Auto 2]]''. Set within the fictional Liberty City, loosely based on [[New York City]], the game follows a criminal named [[Claude (Grand Theft Auto)|Claude]] after he is left for dead and quickly becomes entangled in a world of gangs, crime and corruption. The game is played from a [[Third-person (video games)|third-person perspective]] and its world is navigated on foot or by vehicle. The [[open world]] design lets players freely roam the three islands of Liberty City.\n\nDevelopment was shared between DMA Design, based in [[Edinburgh]], and Rockstar, based in [[New York City]]. Much of the development work involved transforming popular elements from the ''Grand Theft Auto'' series into a fully 3D world for the first time. The game was delayed following the [[September 11 attacks]] to allow the team to change references and gameplay deemed inappropriate. It was released in October 2001 for the [[PlayStation 2]], in May 2002 for [[Microsoft Windows]], and in October 2003 for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]].\n\nUpon release, ''Grand Theft Auto III'' received critical acclaim, with praise particularly directed at its concept and gameplay. However, the game also generated controversy, with criticism directed at its depictions of violence and sex. It became the [[best-selling video game]] of 2001, and has sold over 14.5 million copies since. Considered by many critics as one of the most significant titles of the [[Sixth generation of video game consoles|sixth generation of video games]], and one of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games of all time]], it won a number of year-end accolades, including [[Game of the Year]] awards from several [[Video game journalism|gaming publications]]. Since its release, it has received [[Porting|ports]] to many different gaming platforms. An enhanced version of the game was released on [[mobile platforms]] in 2011, for the game's tenth anniversary. Its successor, ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]]'', was released in October 2002, and two prequels, ''[[Grand Theft Auto Advance|Advance]]'' and ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories|Liberty City Stories]]'', were released in 2004 and 2005, respectively.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Gta3-pc-walking.jpeg|left|thumb|Players can freely roam the game's world and have the ability to use weapons to accomplish tasks.]]\n''Grand Theft Auto III'' is an [[action-adventure game]] played from a [[third-person perspective]]. Players complete missions\u2014linear scenarios with set objectives\u2014to progress through the story.<ref name=\"IGN Review\" /> It is possible to have several active missions running at one time, as some missions require players to wait for further instructions or events.<ref name=\"IGN Benzies DMA\" /> Outside of missions, players can [[Nonlinear gameplay|freely roam]] the game's [[open world]], and have the ability to complete optional side missions. Liberty City is composed of three boroughs: Portland, Staunton Island, and Shoreside Vale; the latter two areas become unlocked as the story progresses.<ref name=\"IGN Benzies\" />\n\nPlayers may run, jump or use vehicles to navigate the game's world.<ref name=\"IGN Cars\" /> In combat, [[auto-aim]] can be used as assistance against enemies.<ref name=\"GameSpot Hands-On\" /> Should players take damage, their health meter can be fully regenerated through the use of health pick-ups. [[Personal armor|Body armour]] can be used to absorb gunshots and explosive damage, but is used up in the process.{{sfn|DMA Design|2001|p=12}} When health is entirely depleted, gameplay stops and players [[Spawning (video game)|respawn]] at the nearest hospital, at the expense of losing armour and an amount of money.<ref name=\"GameRev Review\" />\n\nIf players commit crimes while playing, the game's law enforcement agencies may respond as indicated by a \"[[Fugitive|wanted]]\" meter in the [[HUD (video gaming)|head-up display]] (HUD). On the meter, the displayed stars indicate the current wanted level<ref name=\"AllGame Review\" /> (for example, at the maximum six-star level, efforts by law enforcement to incapacitate players become very aggressive).{{sfn|DMA Design|2001|p=11}} Law enforcement officers will search for players who leave the wanted vicinity. The wanted meter enters a [[cooldown]] mode and eventually recedes when players are hidden from the officers' line of sight.<ref name=\"AllGame Review\" />\n\nThe game lets players control the [[Muteness|mute]] criminal [[Claude (Grand Theft Auto)|Claude]].<ref name=\"Q-A\" /> During the story, Claude meets various new characters from gangs. As players complete missions for different gangs, fellow gang members will often defend players, while rival gang members will recognise players and subsequently shoot on sight.<ref name=\"IGN Gangs\" /> While free roaming the game world, players may engage in activities such as a [[vigilante]] minigame, a [[fire fighting]] activity, a paramedic service and a [[taxi cab]] service.<ref name=\"AllGame Review\" /><ref name=\"IGN Hood\" /> Completion of these activities grants players with context-specific rewards; for example, completing the vigilante mission allows players to [[bribe]] police after committing a crime.<ref name=\"1UP Essential\" />\n\n[[File:GTAIII PS2 Beta Drive-by.jpg|thumb|right|Combat in ''Grand Theft Auto III'' was reworked to allow players to perform [[drive-by shooting]]s by viewing sideways in a car.]]\n\nPlayers use [[Melee#Use in gaming|melee]] attacks, firearms and explosives to fight enemies. The firearms include weapons such as the [[Micro Uzi]], an [[M16 rifle]] and a [[flamethrower]].<ref name=\"IGN Benzies\" /> The game's three-dimension environment allows a [[first-person view]] while aiming with the [[sniper rifle]], [[rocket launcher]] and the [[M16 rifle]]. In addition, the game's combat was reworked to allow players to commit [[drive-by shooting]]s by facing sideways in a vehicle.<ref name=\"IGN Review\" /> The game gives players a wide variety of weapon options\u2014they can be purchased from local [[firearms dealer]]s, found on the ground, retrieved from dead enemies, or found around the city.{{sfn|DMA Design|2001|p=12}}\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 2001, small-time criminal [[Claude (Grand Theft Auto)|Claude]] is shot and betrayed by his girlfriend Catalina during a bank heist outside Liberty City. Although he survives, Claude is arrested and sentenced to prison. However, while being transferred, the Colombian Cartel ambush his prison transport in order to secure one of the other prisoners on it. In the chaos, Claude escapes alongside 8-Ball, a bombs expert, and goes into hiding within Portland. Introduced by 8-Ball to the Leone [[American Mafia|Mafia]] family, Claude works with several of its members, becoming slowly involved in a war between them and the [[Triad (organized crime)|Triads]]. He ultimately gains the respect of [[Crime boss|Don]] Salvatore Leone, who asks him to help with the war, and eventually in dealing with the Cartel by destroying a ship they are using to manufacture a new street drug. After the job is completed, Claude is warned by Salvatore's [[trophy wife]], Maria, whom he met while looking after her for Salvatore, that he has become paranoid and plans to kill him.\n\nAided by Maria's friend Asuka Kasen, co-leader of the [[Yakuza]], the pair escape to Staunton Island, whereupon Claude is asked to cut his ties to the Leones by killing Salvatore. Claude begins working for the Yakuza, taking jobs from Asuka and her brother Kenji. During this time, he also works for corrupt LCPD detective Ray Machowski, and media mogul Donald Love, who asks Claude to rescue the prisoner the Cartel abducted, and assassinate Kenji in order to start a war between the Yakuza and the Cartel. Eventually, Claude takes on a job that leads to him confronting Catalina, only for her to escape, leaving behind her partner Miguel. Asuka secures him for interrogation over Kenji's death, asking Claude to help her hit the Cartel's operations on the assumption they had her brother murdered.\n\nClaude's attacks on the Cartel eventually attract Catalina's wrath, who murders Asuka and Miguel, and kidnaps Maria, demanding a $500,000 ransom for her. When Claude meets with Catalina to give her the money, she double-crosses him and leaves him for dead again. After escaping, Claude pursues Catalina who attempts to leave by helicopter, saving Maria and killing Catalina for good. As Claude and Maria flee the scene, the latter begins to complain about her kidnapping and the state of her appearance. As the credits roll and the scene blacks out, a gunshot is heard and Maria's voice is silenced.{{efn|The sound of a gunshot, and the silencing of Maria's voice, has led to speculation that Claude fired the shot to kill Maria or just to silence her.

Benzies stated that the intention was to recreate the \"freedom and diversity\" of the previous games in a \"living, breathing 3D world\", using the power of the PlayStation 2 to do so.<ref name=\"IGN Benzies\" /> The console's ability to use [[DVD]]s, an improvement over the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]'s limit to [[CD]]s, allowed the team to store more data, such as animations, music and environments.{{sfn|Kushner|2012|p=81}} Despite this, the team found it difficult to fit the game into the PlayStation 2's 32 megabytes of [[RAM]], due to the scale.

He wanted the story to be more nuanced and interesting than the generic \"rise and fall and rise again of a superhero bad guy\".<ref name=\"EW Dan\" /> The game's script was also focused on mission objectives, attempting to implement high amounts of interactivity.<ref name=\"IGN How2\" /> Houser felt that each mission is \"its own short story\", and part of an \"overarching story\".<ref name=\"GameSpot Dan\" /> Houser and co-writer James Worrall drew influence from mob films, and the mafiosi featured in films by [[Martin Scorsese]]. When writing the story, Houser and Worrall regularly met with the designers, and filled a room with [[post-it note]]s to reconstruct the story components to shape the game.<ref name=\"IGN How2\" />\n\nMany of the game characters were animated using [[motion capture]], filmed at a rented studio at the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]],{{sfn|Kushner|2012|p=82}} though this was limited by technical restraints. The character movement was also treated as being cinematic, though limited [[Polygon (computer graphics)|polygons]] heavily inhibited this.<ref name=\"IGN How3\" /> Animating [[non-player character]]s entering and driving cars proved to be difficult for the team, due to the variety of vehicle designs. \"It involved chaining together dozens of different animations and altering key frames in code,\" recalled software engineer [[Alan Campbell (writer)|Alan Campbell]].{{sfn|Crookes|2013|pp=58\u201363}} The team used varying camera angles when animating the game's cutscenes, in order to evoke different emotions.<ref name=\"IGN Cinematic\" /> For the voice acting, the team wanted \"natural, subtle performances\", which proved difficult as many of the actors \"had in their head the idea that because video games are animated their performances needed to be animated\", explained motion capture director [[Navid Khonsari]].<ref name=\"IGN How3\" /> The game's playable protagonist is unnamed in the game,<ref name=\"IGN Characters\" /> and his name is not officially revealed as [[Claude (Grand Theft Auto)|Claude]] until his appearance in ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' (2004). He is a [[silent protagonist]], never speaking throughout his appearances. The team decided to make Claude silent primarily because it \"did not seem like a major issue\", due to the other challenges faced during development, and also partly to allow players to identify with the character, as the character will be who the players want him to be.<ref name=\"Q-A\" />\n\n=== Sound design ===\n''Grand Theft Auto III'' features about three-and-a-half hours of in-game radio material. For the music, the team sought a broad diversity, to recreate the real sensation of skipping through radio stations, reflecting the [[Mob film|gangster movie]] culture invoked by the game. The team used the talk radio stations to add character to the city, and provide a \"unique take on American life\";<ref name=\"IGN Sounds3\" /> Sam Houser described it as \"a very iconoclastic look at America\".<ref name=\"IGN Sam\" /> The team used real [[Disc jockey|DJ]]s to portray those on the radio. In doing so, the team wrote unusual dialogue for the DJs, seeking the effect of \"high production values and absurd content\". Music director Craig Conner assembled the assets of the radio station\u2014music, advertisements, DJ dialogue, station imaging.<ref name=\"IGN Sounds3\" />\n\n=== Cuts and changes ===\n{{Multiple image|align=right|direction=horizontal|total_width=500|image1=GTAIII LCPD copcar change.jpg|caption1=After the events of [[9/11]], the original colour scheme of the police cars in the game (top), which resembled the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]], was changed to a generic black-and-white design common in the United States.|image2=GTA3 UK Cover.jpg|caption2=The original artwork for the game, which was changed after the events of 9/11.<ref name=\"Questions 2\"/> This artwork was still used as the cover in Europe.<ref name=\"Edge LCS\"/>}}\n\n{{Quote|quote=[W]e felt that a full content review of all our titles and the marketing materials we use to represent them was absolutely necessary for us ... we have come across certain small contextual references that we were no longer comfortable with, as well as a couple of very rare gameplay instances that no longer felt appropriate to us.|author=Terry Donovan, Rockstar managing director|source=IGN, 19 September 2001<ref name=\"911 Delay\"/>}}\n\nPrior to the initial release, several modifications were made to the game. While changes are frequent during [[game development]], the changes in ''Grand Theft Auto III'' were noted to be around the time of the [[September 11 attacks]], which led to speculation that some changes were motivated by the attacks. On 19 September 2001, Rockstar delayed the game's release by three weeks, citing the attacks as an influencing factor in the delay.<ref name=\"911 Delay\" /> \"Everyone had someone who had an uncle or brother [who was impacted by the attack]\", said [[Paul Eibeler]], then-president of distributor [[Take-Two Interactive]].{{sfn|Kushner|2012|p=98}}\n\nOne of the changes made shortly after the September 11 attacks was the colour scheme of the [[police cars]]; the original colour scheme of blue with white stripes specifically resembled that of the [[New York City Police Department]]. It was changed to black-and-white designs common among several police departments in the United States, such as [[Los Angeles Police Department|Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco Police Department|San Francisco]]. Other changes include altering the flight path of a plane to avoid appearing to fly into or behind a skyscraper, removing a mission referencing terrorists, as well as some changes to pedestrian dialogue and talk radio.<ref name=\"Eurogamer 911\" /> Another cut to the game is the character of Darkel, a revolutionary urchin who vowed to bring down the city's economy. When references to Darkel were found in the game's code, speculation arose that the character was related to 9/11, however Dan Houser explained that the character had been cut \"months before [release]\".<ref name=\"Eurogamer 911\" /> There are also reports and previews stating that the game featured school children as pedestrians prior to release,<ref name=\"GameSpot Impressions\" /> although Rockstar has dismissed such rumours as \"nonsense\".<ref name=\"Questions 2\" />\n\nRockstar stated that the game was \"about 1% different\" after 9/11, and that the biggest change was the cover art. They felt that the original cover, which was ultimately released as the cover in Europe, felt \"too raw\" after 9/11, and was changed into what became the \"signature style\" of the series.<ref name=\"Questions 2\" /> Sam Houser claimed that the cover was designed in an evening, and was instantly preferred over the original cover.<ref name=\"Edge LCS\" /> The cover was inspired by the movie posters for 1960s films, such as ''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1968 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]'' (1968).<ref name=\"Questions 2\" />\n\n== Critical reception ==\n=== Initial release ===\n{{Video game reviews\n| title   = PlayStation 2 version reception\n| MC      = 97/100<ref name=\"MC\"/>\n| 1UP     = A+<ref name=\"1UP Review\"/>\n| Allgame = {{rating|5|5}}<ref name=\"AllGame Review\"/>\n| Edge    = 8/10<ref name=\"Edge Review\"/>\n| EuroG   = 10/10<ref name=\"Eurogamer Review\"/>\n| GamePro = 5/5<ref name=\"GamePro Review\"/>\n| GameRev = A<ref name=\"GameRev Review\"/>\n| GI      = 9.5/10<ref name=\"Game Informer Review\"/>\n| GSpot   = 9.6/10<ref name=\"GameSpot Review\"/>\n| GSpy    = 94/100<ref name=\"GameSpy Review\"/>\n| IGN     = 9.6/10<ref name=\"IGN Review\"/>\n}}\n''Grand Theft Auto III'' was released to critical acclaim.

Psychologist [[David Walsh (psychologist)|David Walsh]] of the [[National Institute on Media and the Family]] stated that the game \"glamorizes antisocial and criminal activity\",<ref name=\"USAToday Glorifies\" /> and that \"the purpose of the game is to perpetrate crime\".<ref name=\"Kotaku Scapegoat\" /> In response, ''[[Kotaku]]'' writer Owen Good wrote that the game does not reward players for \"proficiency at crime, no matter how much it is accused of doing so\".<ref name=\"Kotaku Scapegoat\" /> Joanna Weiss of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' noted the \"adrenaline\" that players feel when committing crimes in the game, excusing the game's violence due to its mature classification.<ref name=\"Boston Globe\" /> The [[National Organization for Women]] spoke out against the game in January 2002, asking Rockstar and Take-Two to withdraw the game from sale as it \"encourages violence and the degradation of women\".<ref name=\"Morality\" /> [[Matt Richtel]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that the activities within the game \"crossed the line into bad taste\".<ref name=\"NYT\" />\n\n''Grand Theft Auto III'' was initially released in Australia with an MA15+ classification. After re-reviewing the game, the [[Australian Classification Board|Office of Film and Literature Classification]] (OFLC) [[List of banned video games in Australia|banned it]], due to its depiction of sexual content and violence to prostitutes.<ref name=\"GameSpot Aus Ban\" /><ref name=\"GameSpot Aus\" /> This prompted distributor Take-Two Interactive to appeal to the OFLC, who reaffirmed the banned status on 11 December 2001, after reanalysing the game and seeking the professional opinion of a forensic psychologist. This prompted Take-Two to recall the game in Australia, and Rockstar to make appropriate changes to the game; a modified version was re-released with an MA15+ classification in January 2002, removing all instances of sexual acts with prostitutes.<ref name=\"GameSpot Aus\" /> The game was re-rated with an R18+ classification in September 2019, citing \"sexual activities related to incentives and rewards\".<ref name=\"Kotaku Aus\" />\n\nOn 25 June 2003, teenage stepbrothers William and Josh Buckner shot and killed Aaron Hamel and Kimberly Bede. In statements to investigators, the perpretators claimed their actions were inspired by ''Grand Theft Auto III''. In response, on 20 October 2003, the families of Hamel and Bede filed a US$246 million lawsuit against Rockstar Games, Take-Two Interactive, [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] and [[Wal-Mart]].<ref name=\"CNN Lawsuit\" /> Rockstar and Take-Two filed for dismissal of the lawsuit, stating in [[United States district court]] on 29 October 2003 that the \"ideas and concepts\", and the \"purported psychological effects\" of the perpetrators, are protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]'s free-speech clause.<ref name=\"GameSpot dismiss\" /> [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]], the lawyer representing the victims, denied Rockstar's claims, and attempted to move the lawsuit into a state court for consideration under Tennessee's consumer protection act.<ref name=\"GameSpot dismiss\" />\n\n== Legacy ==\n''Grand Theft Auto III'' has been frequently included among the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games of all time]].<ref name=\"Greatest\" /> In 2007, [[GamePro]] called ''Grand Theft Auto III'' the most important video game of all time, explaining that the \"game's open-ended gameplay elements have revolutionized the way all video games are made\".<ref name=\"GamePro\" /> Similarly, IGN ranked the game among the Top 10 Most Influential Games,<ref name=\"IGN Influential\" /> and GameSpot listed among the greatest games of all time.<ref name=\"GameSpot Greatest\" /> In 2009, ''Game Informer'' wrote that ''Grand Theft Auto III'' \"changed the gaming landscape forever with its immersive open world sandbox\",{{sfn|Game Informer|2009|pp=44\u201379}} and in 2016 [[GamesRadar]] named it \"the most important game of the decade\".<ref name=\"GamesRadar Decade\" /> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' named it one of the greatest video games of all time in November 2012<ref name=\"Time Magazine\" /> and August 2016.<ref name=\"Time Magazine 2\" />\n\n''Grand Theft Auto III'' is considered to have a leading role in the popularisation of [[sandbox game]]s, inspiring those such as ''[[True Crime (series)|True Crime]]'' (2003\u201305), ''[[Saints Row]]'' (2006\u2013present) and ''[[Crackdown]]'' (2007).<ref name=\"IGN Influential\" /> The term \"[[Grand Theft Auto clone|''Grand Theft Auto'' clone]]\" is frequently used to describe subsequent video games released with similar open-ended gameplay as ''Grand Theft Auto III''.<ref name=\"GTA Clone\" /> While previous video games used open world design, including earlier ''Grand Theft Auto'' games, ''Grand Theft Auto III'' took this gameplay foundation and expanded it into a 3D world,<ref name=\"GameSpot Greatest\" /> offering an unprecedented variety of minigames and side-missions.<ref name=\"IGN Influential\" /> Due to the greater success of the game over its predecessors, it is credited with popularising the open-world genre;<ref name=\"DMA\" /> Dan Houser felt that the game made it \"one of the most vibrant genres today\".<ref name=\"GameSpot Dan\" />\n\nThe game also led the trend of mature video games; Dan Houser felt that it allowed other developers to create violent shooters.<ref name=\"IGN Delighted\" /> [[Hal Halpin]], president of the [[Entertainment Consumers Association]], described ''Grand Theft Auto III'' as the \"lightning rod for the violence-in-games debate\".<ref name=\"1UP Legacy\" /> ''[[Metro (magazine)|Metro]]''{{'}}s Roger Hargreaves wrote that it \"emboldened a whole new wave of games that were ... fixated with violence, gang culture\".<ref name=\"Metro Midweek\" /> Greg Ford of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' felt that the game allowed the medium to handle mature subject matter in a more serious manner than previously perceived, and noted the improvement of video game classification as a result of the game's controversy.<ref name=\"1UP Legacy\" />\n\nFollowing the game's success, Rockstar developed further titles in the series. ''Vice City'' and ''San Andreas'' are set in their titular locations in 1986 and 1992, respectively.<ref name=\"Vice City\" /><ref name=\"San Andreas\" /> ''[[Grand Theft Auto (Game Boy Advance)|Grand Theft Auto Advance]]'' (2004) is set in Liberty City roughly one year before the events of ''Grand Theft Auto III''.<ref name=\"Advance\" /> ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories]]'' (2005) takes place three years before the events of ''Grand Theft Auto III'' in the same rendition of Liberty City.<ref name=\"Trilogy\" /> A completely redesigned version of the city was later used in ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'' (2008),<ref name=\"GTA IV\" /> ''[[Grand Theft Auto: The Lost and Damned|The Lost and Damned]]'' (2009),<ref name=\"Lost and Damned\" /> ''[[Grand Theft Auto: The Ballad of Gay Tony|The Ballad of Gay Tony]]'' (2009)<ref name=\"Ballad of Gay Tony\" /> and ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars|Chinatown Wars]]'' (2009).<ref name=\"Chinatown Wars\" />\n\n=== Ports and remakes ===\n''Grand Theft Auto III'' was released on 21 May 2002 for [[Microsoft Windows]], supporting higher screen resolutions and draw distance, and featuring more detailed textures.<ref name=\"PC\" /> A [[GameCube]] release was planned, but later cancelled.<ref name=\"GameCube\" /> In December 2003, the game was released on the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], with its sequel ''Vice City'' in a compilation titled ''Grand Theft Auto: Double Pack''. The Xbox port features custom soundtrack support as well as improved audio, [[Model (computer games)|polygon models]], and reflections over the previous ports.<ref name=\"Xbox\" /> ''Double Pack'' was later bundled with ''San Andreas'' in a compilation titled ''[[Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy]]'', released in October 2005.<ref name=\"Trilogy\" /> ''The Trilogy'' was also released for [[OS X]] on 12 November 2010.<ref name=\"Mac\" /> . On 15 December 2011, for the game's tenth anniversary War Drum Studios ported the game to [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. This port is almost identical to the Windows version with the addition of enhanced models and textures and touchscreen controls.<ref name=\"Mobile1\" /><ref name=\"Mobile2\" /> This port was also released on [[Fire OS]] on 15 May 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/2014/5/15/5721390/grand-theft-auto-trilogy-amazon-fire-tv-kindle-fire |title=Grand Theft Auto trilogy launches for Amazon Fire TV, Kindle Fire |first=Megan |last=Farokhmanesh |date=15 May 2014 |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |access-date=17 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190828082916/https://www.polygon.com/2014/5/15/5721390/grand-theft-auto-trilogy-amazon-fire-tv-kindle-fire |archive-date=28 August 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> A [[PlayStation 3]] version was released on 25 September 2012 via the [[PlayStation Network]].<ref name=\"PS3\" /> The original PlayStation 2 version was released for the [[PlayStation 4]], as a [[List of PlayStation 2 games for PlayStation 4|PS2 Classics]] title, on 5 December 2015.<ref name=\"PS4\" /> In 2012, a [[Modding in Grand Theft Auto|modding]] community under the name RAGE Classic Team ported the map over to ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'', named ''Grand Theft Auto III: RAGE Classic''.<ref>{{cite web|title=GTA III Rage Classic Mod Puts GTA III Into GTA IV|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/games/GTA-III-Rage-Classic-Mod-Puts-GTA-III-GTA-IV-45301.html|first=William|last=Usher|publisher=CinemaBlend|accessdate=3 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203224625/https://www.cinemablend.com/games/GTA-III-Rage-Classic-Mod-Puts-GTA-III-GTA-IV-45301.html|archive-date=3 December 2017|url-status=live|date=3 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"1UP Essential\">{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/features/essential-50-gta3 |title=The Essential 50 Part 49: Grand Theft Auto III |last=Parish |first=Jeremy |work=[[1UP.com]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |accessdate=9 April 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6gdKMMFWh?url=http://www.1up.com/features/essential-50-gta3 |archivedate=9 April 2016 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"1UP Legacy\">{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/features/grand-theft-auto-legacy |title=Grand Theft Auto's Legacy |last=Ford |first=Greg |work=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |publisher=[[EGM Media]] |date=April 2008 |accessdate=14 April 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6gjuFJK1l?url=http://www.1up.com/features/grand-theft-auto-legacy |archivedate=13 April 2016 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"1UP Sam\">{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/features/sam-houser-interview |title=Sam Houser Interview |author=GMR |work=[[1UP.com]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |accessdate=20 March 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6g8OUdanl?url=http://www.1up.com/features/sam-houser-interview |archivedate=19 March 2016 |url-status=dead  |author-link=GMR (magazine) }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"911 Delay\">{{cite web|url=http://ign.com/articles/2001/09/19/take-two-examines-changes-fall-games |title=Take-Two Examines, Changes Fall Games |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=19 September 2001 |accessdate=21 December 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6dvtSL0SK?url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/09/19/take-two-examines-changes-fall-games |archivedate=21 December 2015 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Advance\">{{cite web|url=http://ign.com/articles/2004/09/18/grand-theft-auto-advance |title=Grand Theft Auto Advance |last=Harris |first=Craig |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=17 September 2004 |accessdate=25 September 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6dwSvarDQ?url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/09/18/grand-theft-auto-advance |archivedate=21 December 2015 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Ballad of Gay Tony\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/gtaiv-gay-tony-coming-out-oct-29/1100-6213867/ |title=GTAIV: Gay Tony coming out Oct. 29 |last=Thorsen |first=Tor |work=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=22 July 2009 |accessdate=25 September 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6dwSslHbm?url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/gtaiv-gay-tony-coming-out-oct-29/1100-6213867/ |archivedate=21 December 2015 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Boston Globe\">{{cite web |url=http://www.boston.com/globe/sunday/focus/stories/011302_theft.shtml |title=Connecting with your inner thug |last=Weiss |first=Joanna |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |publisher=[[John W.

{"title_page": "An Unbelievable Story of Rape", "text_new": "\"'''An Unbelievable Story of Rape'''\" is a 2015 article about a [[Washington and Colorado serial rape cases|series of rapes]] in the U.S. states of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Colorado]] that occurred between 2008 and 2011, and the subsequent police investigations. It was a collaboration between two American, non-profit news organizations, [[The Marshall Project]] and [[ProPublica]]. The article was written by [[Ken Armstrong (journalist)|Ken Armstrong]] and [[T. Christian Miller]]. It won the 2016 [[Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting]] and the 2015 [[George Polk Award]] for Justice Reporting.\n\nThe article alternates between two true stories of events occurring between August 2008 and June 2012. The first narrative is about a woman in [[Lynnwood, Washington]], known pseudonymously as \"Marie\", who reports being raped to the police. After repeated interrogation by the police, who do not believe her, she says that her report was false. She is subsequently charged with a [[gross misdemeanor]] for false accusation. The second narrative details the police investigations into a serial rapist in Colorado, who is known to have raped four women and made a fifth attempt. The man is arrested in February 2011, and subsequent evidence on his hard drive reveals that Marie, not previously known to the local investigative team, was raped by him.\n\nT. Christian Miller of ProPublica had been reporting on law enforcement failures in identifying rapists throughout 2015. In August, he learned of the case of Marie and contacted her lawyer, discovering that Ken Armstrong of The Marshall Project was already working on a similar story. They began to collaborate, with Armstrong writing about Marie's story in Washington and Miller writing about the police investigation in Colorado. Marie agreed to speak to Armstrong after six months of communication. The article was further informed by other interviews and thousands of pages of public records material.\n\nThe article was later adapted into the Netflix series ''[[Unbelievable (miniseries)|Unbelievable]]'', which has received critical acclaim. The article also provided the basis of Miller and Armstrong's full-length book ''A False Report: A True Story of Rape in America'' (2018).\n\n==Article content==\nIn [[Lynnwood, Washington]], an 18-year-old woman, referred to as \"Marie,\" reported being bound, gagged and raped at knifepoint to police. Following police confrontation about inconsistencies in her story, she said that she made the incident up. In March 2009, she was charged with a [[gross misdemeanor]], fined $500 and put on probation. Marie had been sexually and physically abused in early life and was in foster care for most of her childhood. She joined Project Ladder at age 18, a program designed for people transitioning from foster care to living alone.\n\nIn [[Golden, Colorado]] during January 2011, Detective Stacy Galbraith interviewed a woman who was raped at gunpoint for four hours. When Galbraith talked to her husband, he observed familiarity with an incident reported to his police department in Westminster. Galbraith began collaboration with Westminster Detective Edna Hendershot, who had investigated two cases in which women aged 59 and 65 were raped in similar ways. They also discovered a burglary where a masked man had attempted to tie up a 46-year-old woman, who jumped out of her window and was badly injured. The four known cases took place in different suburbs of [[Denver]]. The man had gone to extreme lengths to avoid leaving DNA evidence, but [[touch DNA]] from the same paternal family line was found at three scenes.\n\nMarie had made her report in August 2008 to Sergeant Jeffrey Mason and Jerry Rittgarn. Police guidelines advised that rape victims should not be interrogated, as they may be uncertain of details or report conflicting information. Investigating Marie's report, police found evidence of an assailant and abrasions to Marie's vagina and wrist. However, two of Marie's former foster parents began to disbelieve her due to her seemingly calm demeanour, one reporting doubts to the police. Following this, and Marie's conflicting account of when she phoned a friend, Mason and Rittgarn made Marie repeat her story, Rittgarn saying that he disbelieved her. He asked if the rapist was real and she said \"no.\" Without reading the [[Miranda warning|''Miranda'' warning]], they asked her to write that she had made a false report. She wrote instead that she had dreamed the incident, now unsure of what happened. After hours of further questioning, Marie wrote that she had been lying.\n\nProject Ladder staff made Marie return to police when she said she made the report under [[duress]]. She asked to take a [[polygraph test]]\u2014though such tests do not provide reliable evidence\u2014but declined when Rittgarn threatened jail and loss of housing if she failed it. Mason filed a false reporting charge; such charges in similar circumstances were rare. Marie became the subject of media reports and an attack website. She quit her [[Costco]] job and considered suicide. In October 2008, one of Marie's foster parents saw a report of a woman in [[Kirkland, Washington]] raped in the same way as Marie. Kirkland police abandoned this lead after Lynnwood police told them at least twice that Marie's account was a lie.\n\nIn February 2011, a report was unearthed of a suspicious vehicle registered to army veteran Marc Patrick O'Leary, whose description matched the attacker. FBI agents collected DNA evidence from his brother which showed one of them was the rapist. A search warrant led to the arrest of O'Leary. He possessed a mask, gun, women's underwear and other identifying evidence. Photographs of Marie were found on O'Leary's hard drive. O'Leary had watched women for hundreds of hours, breaking into their houses multiple times before each rape. In December 2011, O'Leary was sentenced to 327.5 years in prison for four incidents in Colorado. In June 2012, he was sentenced to an additional 38.5 years for two incidents in Washington.\n\nAn external report condemned the handling of Marie's case. It described the officers' behaviour as \"bullying\" and highlighted threats of jail and housing assistance removal as \"coercive, cruel, and unbelievably unprofessional.\" An internal review also concluded that Mason and Rittgarn's behaviour was \"designed to elicit a confession of false reporting.\" In 2015, the commander of Lynnwood's Criminal Investigations Division said that practices had since changed. Neither Mason nor Rittgarn were disciplined. After Marie approached Mason, he offered an apology. Marie sued the city, winning $150,000. By the time of the article, Marie was married with two children.<ref name=\"Unbelievable Marshall\"/><ref name=\"Unbelievable ProPublica\"/>\n\n==Background==\n===History===\n\"An Unbelievable Story of Rape\" was written by [[Ken Armstrong (journalist)|Ken Armstrong]] and [[T.

It was a collaboration between two American, non-profit news organizations, [[The Marshall Project]] and [[ProPublica]]. The article was written by [[Ken Armstrong (journalist)|Ken Armstrong]] and [[T. Christian Miller]]. It won the 2016 [[Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting]] and the 2015 [[George Polk Award]] for Justice Reporting.\n\nThe article alternates between two true stories of events occurring between August 2008 and June 2012. The first narrative is about a woman in [[Lynnwood, Washington]], known pseudonymously as \"Marie\", who reports being raped to the police. After repeated interrogation by the police, who do not believe her, she says that her report was false. She is subsequently charged with a [[gross misdemeanor]] for false accusation. The second narrative details the police investigations into a serial rapist in Colorado, who is known to have raped four women and made a fifth attempt. The man is arrested in February 2011, and subsequent evidence on his hard drive reveals that Marie, not previously known to the local investigative team, was raped by him.\n\nT. Christian Miller of ProPublica had been reporting on law enforcement failures in identifying rapists throughout 2015. In August, he learned of the case of Marie and contacted her lawyer, discovering that Ken Armstrong of The Marshall Project was already working on a similar story. They began to collaborate, with Armstrong writing about Marie's story in Washington and Miller writing about the police investigation in Colorado. Marie agreed to speak to Armstrong after six months of communication. The article was further informed by other interviews and thousands of pages of public records material.\n\nThe article was later adapted into the Netflix series ''[[Unbelievable (miniseries)|Unbelievable]]'', which has received critical acclaim. The article also provided the basis of Miller and Armstrong's full-length book ''A False Report: A True Story of Rape in America'' (2018).\n\n==Article content==\nIn [[Lynnwood, Washington]], an 18-year-old woman, referred to as \"Marie,\" reported being bound, gagged and raped at knifepoint to police. Following police confrontation about inconsistencies in her story, she said that she made the incident up. In March 2009, she was charged with a [[gross misdemeanor]], fined $500 and put on probation. Marie had been sexually and physically abused in early life and was in foster care for most of her childhood. She joined Project Ladder at age 18, a program designed for people transitioning from foster care to living alone.\n\nIn [[Golden, Colorado]] during January 2011, Detective Stacy Galbraith interviewed a woman who was raped at gunpoint for four hours. When Galbraith talked to her husband, he observed familiarity with an incident reported to his police department in Westminster. Galbraith began collaboration with Westminster Detective Edna Hendershot, who had investigated two cases in which women aged 59 and 65 were raped in similar ways. They also discovered a burglary where a masked man had attempted to tie up a 46-year-old woman, who jumped out of her window and was badly injured. The four known cases took place in different suburbs of [[Denver]]. The man had gone to extreme lengths to avoid leaving DNA evidence, but [[touch DNA]] from the same paternal family line was found at three scenes.\n\nMarie had made her report in August 2008 to Sergeant Jeffrey Mason and Jerry Rittgarn. Police guidelines advised that rape victims should not be interrogated, as they may be uncertain of details or report conflicting information. Investigating Marie's report, police found evidence of an assailant and abrasions to Marie's vagina and wrist. However, two of Marie's former foster parents began to disbelieve her due to her seemingly calm demeanour, one reporting doubts to the police. Following this, and Marie's conflicting account of when she phoned a friend, Mason and Rittgarn made Marie repeat her story, Rittgarn saying that he disbelieved her. He asked if the rapist was real and she said \"no.\" Without reading the [[Miranda warning|''Miranda'' warning]], they asked her to write that she had made a false report. She wrote instead that she had dreamed the incident, now unsure of what happened. After hours of further questioning, Marie wrote that she had been lying.\n\nProject Ladder staff made Marie return to police when she said she made the report under [[duress]]. She asked to take a [[polygraph test]]\u2014though such tests do not provide reliable evidence\u2014but declined when Rittgarn threatened jail and loss of housing if she failed it. Mason filed a false reporting charge; such charges in similar circumstances were rare. Marie became the subject of media reports and an attack website. She quit her [[Costco]] job and considered suicide. In October 2008, one of Marie's foster parents saw a report of a woman in [[Kirkland, Washington]] raped in the same way as Marie. Kirkland police abandoned this lead after Lynnwood police told them at least twice that Marie's account was a lie.\n\nIn February 2011, a report was unearthed of a suspicious vehicle registered to army veteran Marc Patrick O'Leary, whose description matched the attacker. FBI agents collected DNA evidence from his brother which showed one of them was the rapist. A search warrant led to the arrest of O'Leary. He possessed a mask, gun, women's underwear and other identifying evidence. Photographs of Marie were found on O'Leary's hard drive. O'Leary had watched women for hundreds of hours, breaking into their houses multiple times before each rape. In December 2011, O'Leary was sentenced to 327.5 years in prison for four incidents in Colorado. In June 2012, he was sentenced to an additional 38.5 years for two incidents in Washington.\n\nAn external report condemned the handling of Marie's case. It described the officers' behaviour as \"bullying\" and highlighted threats of jail and housing assistance removal as \"coercive, cruel, and unbelievably unprofessional.\" An internal review also concluded that Mason and Rittgarn's behaviour was \"designed to elicit a confession of false reporting.\" In 2015, the commander of Lynnwood's Criminal Investigations Division said that practices had since changed. Neither Mason nor Rittgarn were disciplined. After Marie approached Mason, he offered an apology. Marie sued the city, winning $150,000. By the time of the article, Marie was married with two children.<ref name=\"Unbelievable Marshall\"/><ref name=\"Unbelievable ProPublica\"/>\n\n==Background==\n===History===\n\"An Unbelievable Story of Rape\" was written by [[Ken Armstrong (journalist)|Ken Armstrong]] and [[T.

Over the next 24 years, the team would alternate between varsity and club status in the [[Rocky Mountain Lacrosse Conference|RMLA]], a member of the [[US Lacrosse Intercollegiate Associates]] (USLIA). In 1991, Denver transitioned into [[NCAA Division II]] as a member of the RMILL before making the full transition to [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] with the rest of DU sports in 1999. The Pioneers first joined the [[Great Western Lacrosse League]] (GWLL) as a charter member in 1994, although the Pioneers would not compete in the conference as a full Division I member until 1999.\n\nIn 1999, Denver hired Jamie Munro as head coach for the team's inaugural season in Division I and the GWLL. Under Munro, the Pioneers would win their first conference regular season title after finishing with a 4&ndash;1 conference record (tied with [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's lacrosse|Notre Dame]] and [[Ohio State Buckeyes men's lacrosse|Ohio State]]). After winning the GWLL outright in 2006 with a 5&ndash;0 conference record, Denver earned a bid to their first [[2006 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship|NCAA Tournament]], where they would fall 16&ndash;8 to [[Maryland Terrapins men's lacrosse|Maryland]]. Two years later the Pioneers again shared the GWLL regular season title with Notre Dame and Ohio State, but earned an at-large bid to the [[2008 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship|2008 NCAA Tournament]] with a 10&ndash;7 overall record. Denver would lose to Maryland once again, this time 10&ndash;7.\n\nAfter finishing 1&ndash;4 in the conference and 7&ndash;8 overall in 2009, Jamie Munro resigned. Munro finished with a 90&ndash;70 record as head coach of the Pioneers, securing four GWLL Championship titles (2003, 2005, 2006, 2008) and two NCAA postseason tournament appearances (2006, 2008). He was also named GWLL Coach of the Year in 2000 and 2006.\n\n==Bill Tierney era==\nIn 2009, [[Lacrosse Museum and National Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] coach [[Bill Tierney]] was named head coach of the Pioneers. Tierney was previously the coach at [[Princeton Tigers men's lacrosse|Princeton]] for 22 years, earning 6 NCAA championships in 9 years, appearing in 8 championship games, 9 Final Fours and 11 Ivy League championships.\n\nIn 2010, the Pioneers tied the program-best record of 12&ndash;5 and earned the [[ECAC Lacrosse League|ECAC]] regular season title after completing a 7&ndash;0 conference record. Denver would earn just their third [[2010 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship|NCAA Tournament]] birth, where they would lose to [[Stony Brook Seawolves men's lacrosse|Stony Brook]], 9-7, in the first round.\n\nIn 2011, the Pioneers completed a 15&ndash;3 record, again going undefeated in the ECAC at 6&ndash;0 to capture the conference regular season and tournament championships. In the [[2011 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship|2011 NCAA Tournament]]  the No. 6-seeded Pioneers hosted No. 11 [[Villanova Wildcats men's lacrosse|Villanova]] in front of a standing room-only home crowd of 2,575. In the first NCAA Tournament game to ever be held west of the Mississippi River, Denver earned its first ever tournament win, beating Villanova 13-10 to advance to the quarterfinals. In the quarterfinal round Denver defeated [[Johns Hopkins Blue Jays men's lacrosse|Johns Hopkins]] 14-9 at [[James M. Shuart Stadium]] in [[Hempstead (town), New York|Hempstead, New York]] to earn a spot in the NCAA Final Four. At [[M&T Bank Stadium]] in [[Baltimore]] the Pioneers would fall to the eventual champion [[Virginia Cavaliers men's lacrosse|Virginia]] by a score of 14-8.\n\nFollowing the school's first NCAA Final Four, the Pioneers completed a 9&ndash;7 record while going 3&ndash;3in the ECAC. Although the 9&ndash;7 regular season tally did not compare to previous season records, Denver lost six one&ndash;goal games, including four in overtime throughout the season. The Pioneers would still make the [[2012 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship|2012 NCAA Tournament]] thanks to one of the toughest schedules in the country. In the first round the Pioneers defeated [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's lacrosse|North Carolina]] 16-14 in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]], but would go on to lose to conference rival and eventual national champion [[Loyola Greyhounds men's lacrosse|Loyola-Maryland]] for the third time, by a score of 10&ndash;9 in front of 13,390 fans at the [[Navy\u2013Marine Corps Memorial Stadium]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]].\n\nIn 2013, Denver would once again capture the ECAC regular season crown after earning a 6&ndash;1 conference record and an 11&ndash;3 overall record. After the 11th week of the season Denver would earn the No. 1 ranking in both the Nike/Inside Lacrosse Media Poll and the USILA Coaches Poll, the first time in program history that they have been ranked No. 1 in the country. Denver would go on to lose to [[Ohio State Buckeyes men's lacrosse|Ohio State]] in the ECAC title game, but the Pioneers would earn an at-large bid to the [[2013 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship|2013 NCAA Tournament]]. In the first round Denver would host just the second NCAA Tournament game held west of the Mississippi at a sold out Peter Barton Lacrosse Stadium. A record 2,621 fans were on hand to see Denver top [[Albany Great Danes men's lacrosse|Albany]] 19&ndash;14. In the quarterfinals, Denver faced a rematch of a 2011 first round game against [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's lacrosse|North Carolina]], this time at [[Lucas Oil Stadium]] in [[Indianapolis|Indianapolis, Indiana]]. After falling behind 6&ndash;0 early on, the Pioneers were behind 9&ndash;4 at the half but would go 8&ndash;2 in the second half, including 5&ndash;1 in the final quarter to win 12&ndash;11. Denver became the first team in Men\u2019s Lacrosse Championship Quarterfinal history to win after trailing by five goals or more. In the Pioneer's second semifinal appearance in three years, Denver would fall to [[Syracuse Orange men's lacrosse|Syracuse]] 9&ndash;8 at [[Lincoln Financial Field]] in [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. Denver would end the season 14&ndash;5 and ranked No. 4 in the final polls.\n\nThe 2015 season was the most successful in DU lacrosse history. The Pioneers won both the Big East regular-season<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.denverpioneers.com/sports/m-lacros/recaps/042515aaa.html |title=[5/6] Denver Wins Big East Crown With 18-11

30, 2005. It is the first collegiate stadium in the nation to be designed solely for lacrosse, and is home to DU men's and women's lacrosse teams.The north-facing stadium can accommodate approximately 2,000 people and features pre-cast concrete bench seating, locker rooms for men and women, public restrooms, a concession area, viewing pavilion/conference room and a two-direction press box that also serves the soccer field to the south.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://blogs.du.edu/today/magazine/lacrosse-stadium-opens | title=Lacrosse Stadium Opens | work=University of Denver Magazine | date=June 1, 2005 | accessdate=February 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe stadium is named for the late Peter Barton, who was the former president and chief executive of cable television company Liberty Media Corp. Laura Barton, Peter Barton\u2019s widow, donated the lead gift for the $6.32 million stadium complex. Other prominent donors were John and Anna Sie, and Myra Levy, whose family used to sell concessions at DU football games.\n\nWith a capacity of approximately 2,000, Peter Barton Lacrosse Stadium has hosted 26 sellout games (including an exhibition match against Johns Hopkins on January 30, 2016), including eight in a row (as of 2/28/16). DU is 76-14 all time at Peter Barton Lacrosse, including 45-5 under Coach Bill Tierney, and 21-4 in sellout games.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.denverpioneers.com/sports/m-lacros/recaps/022816aaa.html | title=[1/2] DENVER DOWNS DARTMOUTH 16-6 |date=February 28, 2016 | accessdate=February 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe 10 highest attendance games are listed below:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" \n!Rank\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Attendance\n!Date\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Final score\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Visiting team\n|-\n| 1 || 3,117 || {{dts|March 28, 2015}} || W 19-7 || [[Georgetown Hoyas men's lacrosse|Georgetown]]\n|-\n| 2 || 2,748 || {{dts|May 10, 2014}} || W 9-5* || [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's lacrosse|North Carolina]]\n|-\n| 3 || 2,728 || {{dts|March 7, 2015}} || W 11-10 || [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's lacrosse|Notre Dame]]\n|-\n| 4 || 2,715 || {{dts|April 3, 2015}} || W 15-4 || [[Villanova Wildcats men's lacrosse|Villanova]]\n|-\n| 5 || 2,702 || {{dts|April 12, 2014}} || W 16-9 || [[St. John's Red Storm|St. John's]]\n|-\n| 6 || 2,676 || {{dts|April 18, 2015}} || W 13-9 || [[Providence Friars|Providence]]\n|-\n| 7 || 2,631 || {{dts|February 28, 2016}} || W 16-6 || [[Dartmouth Big Green men's lacrosse|Dartmouth]]\n|-\n| 8 || 2,621 || {{dts|May 11, 2013}} || W 19-14* || [[Albany Great Danes men's lacrosse|Albany]]\n|-\n| 9 || 2,575 || {{dts|May 15, 2011}} || W 13-10* || [[Villanova Wildcats men's lacrosse|Villanova]]\n|-\n| 10 || 2,545 || {{dts|March 12, 2011}} || L 9-10 || [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's lacrosse|Notre Dame]]\n|}\n\n<small>*NCAA Tournament Game</small>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:University of Denver]]\n[[Category:College men's lacrosse teams in the United States]]\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.denverpioneers.com/sports/m-lacros/denv-m-lacros-body.html Official website]\n\n{{University-Denver}}\n{{Big East Conference men's lacrosse navbox}}\n\n[[Category:Denver Pioneers men's lacrosse| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox college lacrosse team\n| name      = Denver Pioneers\n|image = Denver Pioneers logo.svg\n|image_size = \n| caption       = \n| university    = [[University of Denver]]\n| nickname = [[Denver Pioneers|Pioneers]]\n| founded       = 1966, [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] since 1999\n| location      = [[Denver]], [[Colorado]]\n| stadium       = Peter Barton Lacrosse Stadium\n| capacity      = 2,000\n| conference    = [[Big East Conference]]\n| coach         = [[Bill Tierney]]\n| tenure        = since&nbsp;2009\n| pre_NCAA      =\n| NCAA_champion = (1) \u2013 2015\n| NCAA_runner   =\n| NCAA_semi     = (5) \u2013 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2017\n| NCAA_quarter  = (7) \u2013 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018\n| NCAA_tourney  = (11) \u2013 2006, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018\n| conf_tourney  = (3) \u2013 2011, 2014, 2015\n| conf_champion = (13) \u2013 2003, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019\n}}\n\nThe '''Denver Pioneers men's lacrosse team''' represents the [[University of Denver]] (DU) in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] [[college lacrosse]].

Over the next 24 years, the team would alternate between varsity and club status in the [[Rocky Mountain Lacrosse Conference|RMLA]], a member of the [[US Lacrosse Intercollegiate Associates]] (USLIA). In 1991, Denver transitioned into [[NCAA Division II]] as a member of the RMILL before making the full transition to [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] with the rest of DU sports in 1999. The Pioneers first joined the [[Great Western Lacrosse League]] (GWLL) as a charter member in 1994, although the Pioneers would not compete in the conference as a full Division I member until 1999.\n\nIn 1999, Denver hired Jamie Munro as head coach for the team's inaugural season in Division I and the GWLL. Under Munro, the Pioneers would win their first conference regular season title after finishing with a 4&ndash;1 conference record (tied with [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's lacrosse|Notre Dame]] and [[Ohio State Buckeyes men's lacrosse|Ohio State]]). After winning the GWLL outright in 2006 with a 5&ndash;0 conference record, Denver earned a bid to their first [[2006 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship|NCAA Tournament]], where they would fall 16&ndash;8 to [[Maryland Terrapins men's lacrosse|Maryland]]. Two years later the Pioneers again shared the GWLL regular season title with Notre Dame and Ohio State, but earned an at-large bid to the [[2008 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship|2008 NCAA Tournament]] with a 10&ndash;7 overall record. Denver would lose to Maryland once again, this time 10&ndash;7.\n\nAfter finishing 1&ndash;4 in the conference and 7&ndash;8 overall in 2009, Jamie Munro resigned. Munro finished with a 90&ndash;70 record as head coach of the Pioneers, securing four GWLL Championship titles (2003, 2005, 2006, 2008) and two NCAA postseason tournament appearances (2006, 2008). He was also named GWLL Coach of the Year in 2000 and 2006.\n\n==Bill Tierney era==\nIn 2009, [[Lacrosse Museum and National Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] coach [[Bill Tierney]] was named head coach of the Pioneers. Tierney was previously the coach at [[Princeton Tigers men's lacrosse|Princeton]] for 22 years, earning 6 NCAA championships in 9 years, appearing in 8 championship games, 9 Final Fours and 11 Ivy League championships.\n\nIn 2010, the Pioneers tied the program-best record of 12&ndash;5 and earned the [[ECAC Lacrosse League|ECAC]] regular season title after completing a 7&ndash;0 conference record. Denver would earn just their third [[2010 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship|NCAA Tournament]] birth, where they would lose to [[Stony Brook Seawolves men's lacrosse|Stony Brook]], 9-7, in the first round.\n\nIn 2011, the Pioneers completed a 15&ndash;3 record, again going undefeated in the ECAC at 6&ndash;0 to capture the conference regular season and tournament championships. In the [[2011 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship|2011 NCAA Tournament]]  the No. 6-seeded Pioneers hosted No. 11 [[Villanova Wildcats men's lacrosse|Villanova]] in front of a standing room-only home crowd of 2,575. In the first NCAA Tournament game to ever be held west of the Mississippi River, Denver earned its first ever tournament win, beating Villanova 13-10 to advance to the quarterfinals. In the quarterfinal round Denver defeated [[Johns Hopkins Blue Jays men's lacrosse|Johns Hopkins]] 14-9 at [[James M. Shuart Stadium]] in [[Hempstead (town), New York|Hempstead, New York]] to earn a spot in the NCAA Final Four. At [[M&T Bank Stadium]] in [[Baltimore]] the Pioneers would fall to the eventual champion [[Virginia Cavaliers men's lacrosse|Virginia]] by a score of 14-8.\n\nFollowing the school's first NCAA Final Four, the Pioneers completed a 9&ndash;7 record while going 3&ndash;3in the ECAC. Although the 9&ndash;7 regular season tally did not compare to previous season records, Denver lost six one&ndash;goal games, including four in overtime throughout the season. The Pioneers would still make the [[2012 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship|2012 NCAA Tournament]] thanks to one of the toughest schedules in the country. In the first round the Pioneers defeated [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's lacrosse|North Carolina]] 16-14 in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]], but would go on to lose to conference rival and eventual national champion [[Loyola Greyhounds men's lacrosse|Loyola-Maryland]] for the third time, by a score of 10&ndash;9 in front of 13,390 fans at the [[Navy\u2013Marine Corps Memorial Stadium]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]].\n\nIn 2013, Denver would once again capture the ECAC regular season crown after earning a 6&ndash;1 conference record and an 11&ndash;3 overall record. After the 11th week of the season Denver would earn the No. 1 ranking in both the Nike/Inside Lacrosse Media Poll and the USILA Coaches Poll, the first time in program history that they have been ranked No. 1 in the country. Denver would go on to lose to [[Ohio State Buckeyes men's lacrosse|Ohio State]] in the ECAC title game, but the Pioneers would earn an at-large bid to the [[2013 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship|2013 NCAA Tournament]]. In the first round Denver would host just the second NCAA Tournament game held west of the Mississippi at a sold out Peter Barton Lacrosse Stadium. A record 2,621 fans were on hand to see Denver top [[Albany Great Danes men's lacrosse|Albany]] 19&ndash;14. In the quarterfinals, Denver faced a rematch of a 2011 first round game against [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's lacrosse|North Carolina]], this time at [[Lucas Oil Stadium]] in [[Indianapolis|Indianapolis, Indiana]]. After falling behind 6&ndash;0 early on, the Pioneers were behind 9&ndash;4 at the half but would go 8&ndash;2 in the second half, including 5&ndash;1 in the final quarter to win 12&ndash;11. Denver became the first team in Men\u2019s Lacrosse Championship Quarterfinal history to win after trailing by five goals or more. In the Pioneer's second semifinal appearance in three years, Denver would fall to [[Syracuse Orange men's lacrosse|Syracuse]] 9&ndash;8 at [[Lincoln Financial Field]] in [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. Denver would end the season 14&ndash;5 and ranked No. 4 in the final polls.\n\nThe 2015 season was the most successful in DU lacrosse history. The Pioneers won both the Big East regular-season<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.denverpioneers.com/sports/m-lacros/recaps/042515aaa.html |title=[5/6] Denver Wins Big East Crown With 18-11

It is the first collegiate stadium in the nation to be designed solely for lacrosse, and is home to DU men's and women's lacrosse teams.The north-facing stadium can accommodate approximately 2,000 people and features pre-cast concrete bench seating, locker rooms for men and women, public restrooms, a concession area, viewing pavilion/conference room and a two-direction press box that also serves the soccer field to the south.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://blogs.du.edu/today/magazine/lacrosse-stadium-opens | title=Lacrosse Stadium Opens | work=University of Denver Magazine | date=June 1, 2005 | accessdate=February 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe stadium is named for the late Peter Barton, who was the former president and chief executive of cable television company Liberty Media Corp. Laura Barton, Peter Barton\u2019s widow, donated the lead gift for the $6.32 million stadium complex. Other prominent donors were John and Anna Sie, and Myra Levy, whose family used to sell concessions at DU football games.\n\nWith a capacity of approximately 2,000, Peter Barton Lacrosse Stadium has hosted 26 sellout games (including an exhibition match against Johns Hopkins on January 30, 2016), including eight in a row (as of 2/28/16).

He renamed the magazine ''Dress and Vanity Fair'' and published four issues in 1913. It continued to thrive into the twenties. However, it became a casualty of the [[Great Depression]] and declining advertising revenues, although its circulation, at 90,000 copies, was at its peak. Cond\u00e9 Nast announced in December 1935 that ''Vanity Fair'' would be folded into ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' (circulation 156,000) as of the March 1936 issue.<ref>{{Citation |title=Vanity Fair Merged With Vogue by Nast |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 30, 1935 |page=21 |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0E16F935551B728DDDA90B94DA415B858FF1D3 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222201003/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0E16F935551B728DDDA90B94DA415B858FF1D3 |archivedate=February 22, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}.</ref><ref>{{Citation |title=Conde Nast Publications To Combine Two Magazines |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=December 31, 1935 |page=2 }}.</ref>\n\n===Modern revival===\n\nCond\u00e9 Nast Publications, under the ownership of [[Samuel Irving Newhouse, Jr.|S.I.

Famous contributing photographers for the magazine include [[Bruce Weber (photographer)|Bruce Weber]], [[Annie Leibovitz]], [[Mario Testino]] and [[Herb Ritts]], who have all provided the magazine with a string of lavish covers and full-page portraits of current [[celebrities]]. Amongst the most famous of these was the August 1991 Leibovitz cover featuring a naked, pregnant [[Demi Moore]], an image entitled ''[[More Demi Moore]]'' that to this day holds a spot in pop culture.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2016/11/18/1991-vanity-fair-cover-featuring-pregnant-demi-moore-named-1-of-most-influential-images-of-all-time/|title=1991 Vanity Fair cover featuring pregnant Demi Moore named 1 of most influential images of all time|date=2016-11-18|work=Women in the World in Association with The New York Times - WITW|access-date=2017-11-22|language=en-US|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201043746/http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2016/11/18/1991-vanity-fair-cover-featuring-pregnant-demi-moore-named-1-of-most-influential-images-of-all-time/|archivedate=December 1, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to its controversial photography, the magazine also prints articles on a variety of topics. In 1996, journalist [[Marie Brenner]] wrote an [[expos\u00e9 (journalism)|expos\u00e9]] on the [[tobacco industry]] titled \"[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (article)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]\". The article was later adapted into a movie ''[[The Insider (film)|The Insider]]'' (1999), which starred [[Al Pacino]] and [[Russell Crowe]]. Most famously, after more than thirty years of mystery, an article in the May 2005 edition revealed the identity of [[Deep Throat (Watergate)|Deep Throat]] ([[W. Mark Felt]]), one of the sources for ''[[The Washington Post]]'' articles on [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]], which led to the 1974 resignation of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Richard Nixon]]. The magazine also features candid interviews with celebrities, including a monthly [[Proust Questionnaire]]. Other notable interviews have included: [[Teri Hatcher]], who revealed in the magazine that she was sexually abused as a child; [[Jennifer Aniston]]'s first interview after her divorce from [[Brad Pitt]]; [[Anderson Cooper]], who talked about his brother's death; and [[Martha Stewart]]'s first interview after her release from prison.\n\nSome of the pictorials in ''Vanity Fair'' have attracted criticism. The April 1999 issue featured an image of actor [[Mike Myers]] dressed as a [[Hindu]] deity for a photo spread by [[David LaChapelle]]: after criticism, both the photographer and the magazine apologized.<ref>[http://www.saja.org/vf.html SAJA Vanity Fair article], June 9, 2000 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060116102721/http://www.saja.org/vf.html |date=January 16, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nThe magazine was the subject of [[Toby Young]]'s book, ''[[How to Lose Friends and Alienate People (memoir)|How to Lose Friends and Alienate People]]'', about his search for success in [[New York City]] while working for Graydon Carter's ''Vanity Fair''.
