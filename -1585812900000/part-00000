In 1957 Villius joined Swedish Radiotj\u00e4nst (now [[Sveriges Radio]], Sweden's national public radio corporation) and began making popular historical documentaries and programming until he moved to [[Sveriges Television]] (SVT) in 1966. It was at SVT that Villius began working with TV-producer [[Olle H\u00e4ger]], a very productive collaboration that would span some two decades. During the 1980s and 90s, H\u00e4ger and Villius produced several popular documentaries like ''Fyra dagar som skakade Sverige''<ref name=\"NE\"/> (\"Four days that shook Sweden\") in 1988 about the Swedish \"[[Midsummer Crisis]]\" during [[World War II|WW II]] and ''Raoul Wallenberg - f\u00e5nge i Sovjet''<ref name=\"NE\"/> (\"[[Raoul Wallenberg]] - prisoner in the [[Soviet Union]].\") as well as one of SVT's biggest and most popular documentary productions ever, ''Hundra Svenska \u00c5r'' (\"One Hundred Swedish years\"), consisting of eight one-hour documentaries on the history of Sweden during the 20th century from many different perspectives.\n\nOther than his dedication to entertaining and educating, Villius was most famous for his narrating both his own and others' documentaries, and his soft [[Kalmar]]-accent is instantly recognizable to millions of Swedes (even to those who do not know his name). He also played the Minister of Justice in the thriller ''[[The Man from Majorca]]''.

The [[Gujrat, Pakistan|Gujrat]] and [[Gujranwala]] districts of Pakistani [[Punjab]] have also been associated with Gujjars from as early as the 8th century CE, when there existed a Gurjara kingdom in the same area. The [[Saharanpur]] district of [[Uttar Pradesh]] was also known as Gujarat previously, due to the presence of many Gujjar zamindars, or land holding farmer class, in the area.\n\nGurjars are linguistically and religiously diverse.
