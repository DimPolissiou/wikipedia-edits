{"title_page": "John McDougal Atherton", "text_new": "{{COI|date=March 2020}}\n'''John McDougal Atherton''' (1841\u20131932), was an American businessman, property developer, economist, investor and politician based in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. Prior to [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]], he was a distiller of sour mash whiskey. Atherton was elected to one term as a member of the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]] from 1869 to 1871, and served as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]].\n\n==Early life==\n\nJohn McDougal Atherton was the son of Peter Atherton and Elizabeth Mayfield. He was born in [[LaRue County, Kentucky]], on April 1, 1841. <ref>{{cite web|title=J M Atherton And Peter Lee Atherton |url=http://filsonhistorical.org/research-doc/atherton-family-papers-1901-1939/\n|website= Atherton Family Papers, 1901-1939}}</ref>\n\nHis maternal great grandfather was [[Alexander McDougall]], a merchant and privateer, a [[Sons of Liberty]] leader from New York City, who served as a General during the Revolutionary War and on cessation of hostilities became the first President of the [[Bank of New York]]. \n\nHis paternal grandfather, Aaron Atherton (1745\u20131821), was part of a group of settlers who travelled through the [[Cumberland Gap]], led by Samuel Goodwin, who in 1780 founded Goodin or Goodwin Fort, as a frontier settlement of [[Virginia]]. It was a time of sieges and skirmishes with local tribes, with the settlement being raised in July 1781. Following the [[American Revolutionary War]] more settlers arrived. By the time [[Kentucky]] established statehood over this area, Aaron and his son, Peter Atherton (1771-1844) had been operating a small distillery on the banks of Rollin Fork River at [[Knob Creek]]{{dn|date=April 2020}} for over thirty years. Peter and Aaron\u2019s legacy survived and passed to John. Aaron Atherton\u2019s home<ref>{{cite web|title=National Register:J M Atherton grandfather Aaron Atherton\u2019s House in Hodgenville, Kentucky - Retrieved 22 December 2019|url=http://npgallery.nps.gov/AssetDetail/NRIS/90001962|website=National Parks Gallery}}</ref>\nin [[Hodgenville, KY]] was deemed to be of significance and was admitted to the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\nJohn McDougal Atherton\u2019s father, Peter Atherton, died aged seventy-three, when John was three years old. His mother, Elizabeth (nee Mayfield) (1808\u20131885) remarried, and his stepfather, Marshall Key (1806\u20131877), became highly influential in his life and this guardianship encouraged many high profile distillery ventures, enabling him to build his first distillery at the age of 26.\n\n==Education ==\nHe attended school locally at Saint Joseph's, Bardstown, Kentucky, followed by [[Georgetown College, Kentucky]] and then Louisville Law School.\n\n==Career as a distiller==\n\n===J. M. Atherton Whiskey===\n\nAtherton became involved in the Whiskey distillery business early in his career. He founded his own company in 1867 at the age of twenty six, in partnership with his stepfather, and other partners. Within ten years he became the largest employer on [[LaRue County]] with over 200 employees. The Atherton Hotel opened and soon after the town was named [[Athertonville, Kentucky]] in his honor.<ref>{{cite web|title=J M Atherton - Founder of Athertonville|url= http://www.laruecounty.org/communities.shtml#athertonville |website=Founder of Athertonville}}</ref>\n\nThe vicinity around the distillery prospered until prohibition.\n\nHe moved his young family from Athertonville to Louisville in 1873. By 1882, at the age of 41, he had acquired a total of four distilleries in [[LaRue County]], which combined, made him the biggest [[Bourbon whiskey|Bourbon]] producer in the United States. His two distilleries in Athertonville were Mayfield and Atherton, and were located on opposite sides of [[Knob Creek]]{{dn|date=April 2020}}.\n\nHis whiskey brands included \u201cAtherton\u201d (from 1867), \u201cMayfield\u201d (from 1869), \u201cWindsor\u201c, \u201cClifton\u201c and \u201cHoward\u201d, \u201cCarter\u201d and \u201cKenwood\u201d, \u201cBrownfield\u201d and \u201cBaker\u201d.\n\nIn 1882 he relocated J. M. Atherton Company headquarters to [[Whiskey Row, Louisville]] on 125 W Main St. This historic area of the city is now referred to as [[West Main District, Louisville]]. At the height of its capacity the company used 2,200 bushels of grain and produced 6,600 gallons of Whiskey. His maximum storage capacity at [[Athertonville, Kentucky]] was 150,000 gallons.\n\nAs a distiller and as a director of the Distillers and Cattle Feeders' Trust (more commonly known as the Whisky Trust), he was subject to some controversy during the [[Whiskey Ring]] scandal and testified to a congressional committee headed by [[William Windom]] on July 27, 1888. This was first reported in the New York Times on Jun 2, 1882 and the scandal continued for the following decade. \n\nHe eventually sold all his stock in J. M. Atherton Company to the Kentucky Distilleries & Warehouse Company in 1899, in order to focus on his real estate business. This was reported in the New York Times on May 12th, 1899.\n\n===Campaign against prohibition===\n\nAnti-alcohol fervor ran strong and dry forces successfully promoted [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] as a solution for many societal ills. This movement had been gathering pace for nearly a century, gathering pace during his fathers lifetime. \n\nHe was a founding director of the [[Kentucky Distillers Association]]. He opposed constitutional prohibition and in 1886 was a national founder and first president of the National Protective Association.  \n\nUltimately the never-ending campaign by the dry forces movement was a factor when he made a business decision in 1899 to dispense of his controlling stock in the J M Atherton Company.\n\nHe campaigned for other distillers, his peers and business partners, even after he diversified his business interests away from Whiskey. <ref>{{cite web|title=J M Atherton And Peter Lee Atherton |url=http://filsonhistorical.org/research-doc/atherton-family-papers-1901-1939/\n|website=Peter Lee Atherton and J M Atherton }}</ref>\n\nAs a native of Kentucky with so much pride in being at the birthplace of bourbon whiskey and the former owner of many distilleries, he would have been deeply saddened by the 1918 vote to ban alcohol. \n\nHe witnessed first hand Prohibition gathering pace. Agents raided the prestigious [[Pendennis Club]], of which he was a founding member, confiscating large amounts of alcohol. There was also an increase in the  acts of lawlessness, like thefts of whiskey from private establishments by gun-wielding bandits. Prohibition was enacted in 1919, and remained in place until Dec 5th 1933. One year after his death.\n\n==Other business and civic interests==\n\n===Banking=== \n\nAtherton had vast real estate holdings within Kentucky and served on several boards of directors. \n\nHe served as the president of Lincoln Savings Bank and Trust Company. However in 1881 he was elected to the board of the Bank of Kentucky (later rebranded Kentucky National Bank), located at the heart of the central business district at 300 West Main Street, Louisville. He became its director, a position he held until 1928. The seven story building was known for its [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] architecture designed by the [[McDonald Brothers (architects)]].\n\n===Infrastructure development within Kentucky and adjacent states  ===\n\nHe was made director of the [[Louisville Gas & Electric]] in 1884. In 1898 he was elected to the board of directors of the [[Louisville & Nashville Railroad]] Company, along with twelve other individuals.<ref>{{cite web|title=Louisville Rail Company|url=\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=DxpQAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA101&dq=john+atherton+louisville+ky+tax&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjc9fyIx-bmAhUPhOAKHZ2kASIQ6AEIUDAG#v=onepage&q=john%20atherton%20louisville%20ky%20tax&f=false|website=J M Atherton role}}</ref>\n\nPrior to that he built his own depot and connected the line from [[New Haven, KY]] with an L&N railroad spur. The town of [[Athertonville, Kentucky]] grew up around this location. His son, Peter Lee Atherton, as part of the Jefferson Highway Association (1911-1918), received his direction on the need to build up Kentucky\u2019s overland transportation links in order for the region to prosper and remain competitive.\n\n===Real estate===\nHe was a Director of the Louisville Realty Company and owned many buildings in the city. The Western Union main office stood at 405-409 W. Market Street, adjacent to the  Lincoln Savings Bank, both were built on land he owned, and were in a long succession of architectural commissions linking Alfred S. Joseph (of [[Joseph & Joseph]]), and  Mr. Atherton. Most prominent in terms of size within downtown  Louisville, was the  Atherton Building <ref>{{cite web|title=Atherton Building |url=http://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/hh/item/ky0008.photos.071020p/|website=Pictures of the Atherton Building, 466 River City Mall, Louisville, KY from the 1930\u2019s}} </ref>, formerly located at 610 S. Fourth Street. Later renamed as the Francis Building, until it was demolished in 1979.\n\n===Political career===\n\nHe was a was a member of the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]] from 1869 to 1871, serving as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Journal of the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Kentucky  - Retrieved 22 December 2019\n|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IsYlAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA393&dq=h+atherton+state+representative+kentucky&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj32O-IvcrmAhVhiOAKHfuMDFIQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&q=h%20atherton%20state%20representative%20kentucky&f=true|website=Printed in 1871}}</ref>\n\nHe was also chairman of the City Government Committee, which studied municipal reform and was a member of the Louisville Board of Education in 1884. In the 1920s he was the head of the committee making a 25 page report making recommendations to reorganize local government in Louisville.\n\nHe received Civic Recognition in 1924 when the Louisville Board of Education named a new school J. M. [[Atherton High School]] for Girls, in honor of his work in furthering education for Kentucky.<ref>{{cite web|title=Atherton School for Girls, now known as Atherton High School, Louisville| url=http://digital.library.louisville.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/heraldpost/id/1184/rec/1/ |website=Atherton school for Girls.

He was in favor of the gold standard.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nOn October 24, 1861 he married Maria B. Farnam, the daughter of his professor and moved to [[Louisville, Kentucky]] in 1873. When Atherton's stepfather died in 1877, he was buried in the same plot as Atherton's biological father, and his older brother, Peter M., who died in 1862. His mother was also buried there upon her death in 1885.\n\nIn 1905  John McDougal Atherton moved to 2542 Ransdell Avenue in the fashionable [[Cherokee Triangle]] area of Louisville.\n\nHe was a founding member of the [[Pendennis Club]],  Louisville Jockey Club and the [[Big Spring Country Club]].\n\nHis son, [[Peter Lee Atherton]] (1862\u20131939), was also a businessman and state legislator; he became known as the \u201cFather of the Jackson Highway\u201c. His financial affiliations were numerous.  He married Mary, had a child and eventually  divorced. His second wife, Cornelia Anderson (1886-1976), was the daughter of Dr Turner Anderson. They married in New York City in 1914. They had 4 children; Valerie, Sarah, Cornelia and John M.\n\n==Later years==\n\nBy 1903 his son Peter Lee Atherton was fully empowered both as a legislator and in business. Seelbach Realty Company was incorporated that year, the company that owned and leased out the [[Seelbach Hotel]].\n\nIn the 1920s he began setting up a number of trusts, transferring control of other parties, particularly to his son Peter, however since his son died less than seven years after his death. A taxation question arose and some cases, particular the ownership of the Atherton Building, which housed the H.P. Selman Department store would not be settled until the mid 1940s.\n\n==Death==\n\nAtherton died on Jun 5, 1932. He was regarded by many historians to be a person of importance to the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Some also refer to him as a pre-prohibition Kentucky Whiskey Baron.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pre-Prohibition Bourbon Baron: J M Atherton| url=https://bourbonveach.com/?s=Atherton |website=Bourbon Baron\u2019s Article |accessdate=29 December 2019}}\n</ref>\n\nHe is buried in [[Cave Hill Cemetery]], Louisville, a stones throw away from other Whiskey Barons, such as George Garvin Brown, Paul Jones, Julian P. Van Winkle and Frederick Stitzel.\n\nLaRue County, where he built upon his father and grandfathers distillery legacy, is still (as of 2020), after 102 years, firmly a prohibition or [[dry county]].\n\n==Legacy and philanthropy==\nDuring his long life Atherton  amassed a substantial estate.  His son Peter Lee\nAtherton <ref>{{cite web|title=J M Atherton And Peter Lee Atherton |url=http://filsonhistorical.org/research-doc/atherton-family-papers-1901-1939/\n|website=Peter Lee Atherton and J M Atherton }}</ref> continued the business affairs but died in 1939. As a recent wealthy widow, his daughter-in-law,  Cornelia A. Atherton sponsored the [[USS Atherton]], following the tragic loss of her son in 1942, Lt. (jg.) John M. Atherton (1918-1942), a Line Officer onboard [[USS Meredith (DD-434)]] torpedoed and sunk during the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater]] of World War II on October 25, 1942.\nA few years later she was recognised as a [[Gold Star Mother]]{{dn|date=April 2020}}.

Prior to [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]], he was a distiller of sour mash whiskey. Atherton was elected to one term as a member of the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]] from 1869 to 1871, and served as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]].\n\n==Early life==\n\nJohn McDougal Atherton was the son of Peter Atherton and Elizabeth Mayfield. He was born in [[LaRue County, Kentucky]], on April 1, 1841. <ref>{{cite web|title=J M Atherton And Peter Lee Atherton |url=http://filsonhistorical.org/research-doc/atherton-family-papers-1901-1939/\n|website= Atherton Family Papers, 1901-1939}}</ref>\n\nHis maternal great grandfather was [[Alexander McDougall]], a merchant and privateer, a [[Sons of Liberty]] leader from New York City, who served as a General during the Revolutionary War and on cessation of hostilities became the first President of the [[Bank of New York]]. \n\nHis paternal grandfather, Aaron Atherton (1745\u20131821), was part of a group of settlers who travelled through the [[Cumberland Gap]], led by Samuel Goodwin, who in 1780 founded Goodin or Goodwin Fort, as a frontier settlement of [[Virginia]]. It was a time of sieges and skirmishes with local tribes, with the settlement being raised in July 1781. Following the [[American Revolutionary War]] more settlers arrived. By the time [[Kentucky]] established statehood over this area, Aaron and his son, Peter Atherton (1771-1844) had been operating a small distillery on the banks of Rollin Fork River at [[Knob Creek]]{{dn|date=April 2020}} for over thirty years. Peter and Aaron\u2019s legacy survived and passed to John. Aaron Atherton\u2019s home<ref>{{cite web|title=National Register:J M Atherton grandfather Aaron Atherton\u2019s House in Hodgenville, Kentucky - Retrieved 22 December 2019|url=http://npgallery.nps.gov/AssetDetail/NRIS/90001962|website=National Parks Gallery}}</ref>\nin [[Hodgenville, KY]] was deemed to be of significance and was admitted to the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\nJohn McDougal Atherton\u2019s father, Peter Atherton, died aged seventy-three, when John was three years old. His mother, Elizabeth (nee Mayfield) (1808\u20131885) remarried, and his stepfather, Marshall Key (1806\u20131877), became highly influential in his life and this guardianship encouraged many high profile distillery ventures, enabling him to build his first distillery at the age of 26.\n\n==Education ==\nHe attended school locally at Saint Joseph's, Bardstown, Kentucky, followed by [[Georgetown College, Kentucky]] and then Louisville Law School.\n\n==Career as a distiller==\n\n===J. M. Atherton Whiskey===\n\nAtherton became involved in the Whiskey distillery business early in his career. He founded his own company in 1867 at the age of twenty six, in partnership with his stepfather, and other partners. Within ten years he became the largest employer on [[LaRue County]] with over 200 employees. The Atherton Hotel opened and soon after the town was named [[Athertonville, Kentucky]] in his honor.<ref>{{cite web|title=J M Atherton - Founder of Athertonville|url= http://www.laruecounty.org/communities.shtml#athertonville |website=Founder of Athertonville}}</ref>\n\nThe vicinity around the distillery prospered until prohibition.\n\nHe moved his young family from Athertonville to Louisville in 1873. By 1882, at the age of 41, he had acquired a total of four distilleries in [[LaRue County]], which combined, made him the biggest [[Bourbon whiskey|Bourbon]] producer in the United States. His two distilleries in Athertonville were Mayfield and Atherton, and were located on opposite sides of [[Knob Creek]]{{dn|date=April 2020}}.\n\nHis whiskey brands included \u201cAtherton\u201d (from 1867), \u201cMayfield\u201d (from 1869), \u201cWindsor\u201c, \u201cClifton\u201c and \u201cHoward\u201d, \u201cCarter\u201d and \u201cKenwood\u201d, \u201cBrownfield\u201d and \u201cBaker\u201d.\n\nIn 1882 he relocated J. M. Atherton Company headquarters to [[Whiskey Row, Louisville]] on 125 W Main St. This historic area of the city is now referred to as [[West Main District, Louisville]]. At the height of its capacity the company used 2,200 bushels of grain and produced 6,600 gallons of Whiskey. His maximum storage capacity at [[Athertonville, Kentucky]] was 150,000 gallons.\n\nAs a distiller and as a director of the Distillers and Cattle Feeders' Trust (more commonly known as the Whisky Trust), he was subject to some controversy during the [[Whiskey Ring]] scandal and testified to a congressional committee headed by [[William Windom]] on July 27, 1888. This was first reported in the New York Times on Jun 2, 1882 and the scandal continued for the following decade. \n\nHe eventually sold all his stock in J. M. Atherton Company to the Kentucky Distilleries & Warehouse Company in 1899, in order to focus on his real estate business. This was reported in the New York Times on May 12th, 1899.\n\n===Campaign against prohibition===\n\nAnti-alcohol fervor ran strong and dry forces successfully promoted [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] as a solution for many societal ills. This movement had been gathering pace for nearly a century, gathering pace during his fathers lifetime. \n\nHe was a founding director of the [[Kentucky Distillers Association]]. He opposed constitutional prohibition and in 1886 was a national founder and first president of the National Protective Association.  \n\nUltimately the never-ending campaign by the dry forces movement was a factor when he made a business decision in 1899 to dispense of his controlling stock in the J M Atherton Company.\n\nHe campaigned for other distillers, his peers and business partners, even after he diversified his business interests away from Whiskey. <ref>{{cite web|title=J M Atherton And Peter Lee Atherton |url=http://filsonhistorical.org/research-doc/atherton-family-papers-1901-1939/\n|website=Peter Lee Atherton and J M Atherton }}</ref>\n\nAs a native of Kentucky with so much pride in being at the birthplace of bourbon whiskey and the former owner of many distilleries, he would have been deeply saddened by the 1918 vote to ban alcohol. \n\nHe witnessed first hand Prohibition gathering pace. Agents raided the prestigious [[Pendennis Club]], of which he was a founding member, confiscating large amounts of alcohol. There was also an increase in the  acts of lawlessness, like thefts of whiskey from private establishments by gun-wielding bandits. Prohibition was enacted in 1919, and remained in place until Dec 5th 1933. One year after his death.\n\n==Other business and civic interests==\n\n===Banking=== \n\nAtherton had vast real estate holdings within Kentucky and served on several boards of directors. \n\nHe served as the president of Lincoln Savings Bank and Trust Company. However in 1881 he was elected to the board of the Bank of Kentucky (later rebranded Kentucky National Bank), located at the heart of the central business district at 300 West Main Street, Louisville. He became its director, a position he held until 1928. The seven story building was known for its [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] architecture designed by the [[McDonald Brothers (architects)]].\n\n===Infrastructure development within Kentucky and adjacent states  ===\n\nHe was made director of the [[Louisville Gas & Electric]] in 1884. In 1898 he was elected to the board of directors of the [[Louisville & Nashville Railroad]] Company, along with twelve other individuals.<ref>{{cite web|title=Louisville Rail Company|url=\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=DxpQAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA101&dq=john+atherton+louisville+ky+tax&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjc9fyIx-bmAhUPhOAKHZ2kASIQ6AEIUDAG#v=onepage&q=john%20atherton%20louisville%20ky%20tax&f=false|website=J M Atherton role}}</ref>\n\nPrior to that he built his own depot and connected the line from [[New Haven, KY]] with an L&N railroad spur. The town of [[Athertonville, Kentucky]] grew up around this location. His son, Peter Lee Atherton, as part of the Jefferson Highway Association (1911-1918), received his direction on the need to build up Kentucky\u2019s overland transportation links in order for the region to prosper and remain competitive.\n\n===Real estate===\nHe was a Director of the Louisville Realty Company and owned many buildings in the city. The Western Union main office stood at 405-409 W. Market Street, adjacent to the  Lincoln Savings Bank, both were built on land he owned, and were in a long succession of architectural commissions linking Alfred S. Joseph (of [[Joseph & Joseph]]), and  Mr. Atherton. Most prominent in terms of size within downtown  Louisville, was the  Atherton Building <ref>{{cite web|title=Atherton Building |url=http://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/hh/item/ky0008.photos.071020p/|website=Pictures of the Atherton Building, 466 River City Mall, Louisville, KY from the 1930\u2019s}} </ref>, formerly located at 610 S. Fourth Street. Later renamed as the Francis Building, until it was demolished in 1979.\n\n===Political career===\n\nHe was a was a member of the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]] from 1869 to 1871, serving as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Journal of the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Kentucky  - Retrieved 22 December 2019\n|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IsYlAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA393&dq=h+atherton+state+representative+kentucky&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj32O-IvcrmAhVhiOAKHfuMDFIQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&q=h%20atherton%20state%20representative%20kentucky&f=true|website=Printed in 1871}}</ref>\n\nHe was also chairman of the City Government Committee, which studied municipal reform and was a member of the Louisville Board of Education in 1884. In the 1920s he was the head of the committee making a 25 page report making recommendations to reorganize local government in Louisville.\n\nHe received Civic Recognition in 1924 when the Louisville Board of Education named a new school J. M. [[Atherton High School]] for Girls, in honor of his work in furthering eduction for Kentucky.<ref>{{cite web|title=Atherton School for Girls, now known as Atherton High School, Louisville| url=http://digital.library.louisville.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/heraldpost/id/1184/rec/1/ |website=Atherton school for Girls. Retrieved 29 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nA Democrat all his life, in the 1920s he gave at the Kentucky Democratic convention entitled \"The Drop of Sweat.\" relating to the issue of free silver. He was in favor of the gold standard.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nOn October 24, 1861 he married Maria B. Farnam, the daughter of his professor and moved to [[Louisville, Kentucky]] in 1873. When Atherton's stepfather died in 1877, he was buried in the same plot as Atherton's biological father, and his older brother, Peter M., who died in 1862. His mother was also buried there upon her death in 1885.\n\nIn 1905  John McDougal Atherton moved to 2542 Ransdell Avenue in the fashionable [[Cherokee Triangle]] area of Louisville.\n\nHe was a founding member of the [[Pendennis Club]],  Louisville Jockey Club and the [[Big Spring Country Club]].\n\nHis son, [[Peter Lee Atherton]] (1862\u20131939), was also a businessman and state legislator; he became known as the \u201cFather of the Jackson Highway\u201c. His financial affiliations were numerous.  He married Mary, had a child and eventually  divorced. His second wife, Cornelia Anderson (1886-1976), was the daughter of Dr Turner Anderson. They married in New York City in 1914. They had 4 children; Valerie, Sarah, Cornelia and John M.\n\n==Later years==\n\nBy 1903 his son Peter Lee Atherton was fully empowered both as a legislator and in business. Seelbach Realty Company was incorporated that year, the company that owned and leased out the [[Seelbach Hotel]].\n\nIn the 1920s he began setting up a number of trusts, transferring control of other parties, particularly to his son Peter, however since his son died less than seven years after his death. A taxation question arose and some cases, particular the ownership of the Atherton Building, which housed the H.P. Selman Department store would not be settled until the mid 1940s.\n\n==Death==\n\nAtherton died on Jun 5, 1932. He was regarded by many historians to be a person of importance to the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Some also refer to him as a pre-prohibition Kentucky Whiskey Baron.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pre-Prohibition Bourbon Baron: J M Atherton| url=https://bourbonveach.com/?s=Atherton |website=Bourbon Baron\u2019s Article |accessdate=29 December 2019}}\n</ref>\n\nHe is buried in [[Cave Hill Cemetery]], Louisville, a stones throw away from other Whiskey Barons, such as George Garvin Brown, Paul Jones, Julian P. Van Winkle and Frederick Stitzel.\n\nLaRue County, where he built upon his father and grandfathers distillery legacy, is still (as of 2020), after 102 years, firmly a prohibition or [[dry county]].\n\n==Legacy and philanthropy==\nDuring his long life Atherton  amassed a substantial estate.  His son Peter Lee\nAtherton <ref>{{cite web|title=J M Atherton And Peter Lee Atherton |url=http://filsonhistorical.org/research-doc/atherton-family-papers-1901-1939/\n|website=Peter Lee Atherton and J M Atherton }}</ref> continued the business affairs but died in 1939. As a recent wealthy widow, his daughter-in-law,  Cornelia A. Atherton sponsored the [[USS Atherton]], following the tragic loss of her son in 1942, Lt. (jg.) John M. Atherton (1918-1942), a Line Officer onboard [[USS Meredith (DD-434)]] torpedoed and sunk during the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater]] of World War II on October 25, 1942.\nA few years later she was recognised as a [[Gold Star Mother]]{{dn|date=April 2020}}. Ironically USS Atherton was transferred to the Japanese in 1955.  Cornelia Atherton is listed as Mrs Peter Lee Atherton in the Principal Women of America (1936 Edition).\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n* {{cite web |title=The Encyclopedia of Louisville by John E.

The [[nipple]] of the breast is surrounded by the [[areola]] (nipple-areola complex). The areola has many sebaceous glands, and the skin color varies from pink to dark brown. The basic units of the breast are the terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs), which produce the fatty breast milk. They give the breast its offspring-feeding functions as a mammary gland. They are distributed throughout the body of the breast. Approximately two-thirds of the lactiferous tissue is within 30&nbsp;mm of the base of the nipple. The terminal lactiferous ducts drain the milk from TDLUs into 4\u201318 lactiferous ducts, which drain to the nipple. The milk-glands-to-fat ratio is 2:1 in a lactating woman, and 1:1 in a non-lactating woman. In addition to the milk glands, the breast is also composed of connective tissues ([[collagen]], [[elastin]]), white fat, and the suspensory Cooper's ligaments. Sensation in the breast is provided by the [[peripheral nervous system]] innervation by means of the front (anterior) and side (lateral) cutaneous branches of the fourth-, fifth-, and sixth [[intercostal nerves]]. The T-4 nerve ([[Thoracic spinal nerve 4]]), which innervates the [[dermatomic area]], supplies sensation to the nipple-areola complex.<ref name=grabowski>{{cite book |first1 = Gerard J. |last1 = Tortora |first2 = Sandra Reynolds |last2 = Grabowski |title = Introduction to the Human Body: the Essentials of Anatomy and Physiology |date = 2001 |publisher = J.

The [[axillary lymph node]]s include the pectoral (chest), subscapular (under the scapula), and humeral (humerus-bone area) lymph-node groups, which drain to the central [[axillary lymph nodes]] and to the apical axillary lymph nodes. The lymphatic drainage of the breasts is especially relevant to [[oncology]] because breast cancer is common to the mammary gland, and cancer cells can [[Metastasis|metastasize]] (break away) from a [[tumour]] and be dispersed to other parts of the body by means of the lymphatic system.\n\n===Shape, texture, and support===\nThe morphologic variations in the size, shape, volume, tissue density, pectoral locale, and spacing of the breasts determine their natural shape, appearance, and position on a woman's chest. Breast size and other characteristics do not predict the fat-to-milk-gland ratio or the potential for the woman to nurse an infant.

The breasts become larger, the nipple-areola complex becomes larger and darker, the [[Montgomery's glands]] enlarge, and veins sometimes become more visible. Breast tenderness during pregnancy is common, especially during the first trimester. By mid-pregnancy, the breast is physiologically capable of lactation and some women can express [[colostrum]], a form of breast milk.{{sfn | Lawrence | 2016 | p=58}}\n\nPregnancy causes elevated levels of the hormone [[prolactin]], which has a key role in the production of milk. However, milk production is blocked by the hormones [[progesterone]] and [[estrogen]] until after delivery, when progesterone and estrogen levels plummet.<ref name=\"NCBI Bookshelf 2008\"/>\n\n===Menopause===\n\nAt menopause, breast atrophy occurs. The breasts can decrease in size when the levels of circulating estrogen decline. The adipose tissue and milk glands also begin to wither. The breasts can also become enlarged from [[Adverse effect|adverse side effect]]<nowiki/>s of [[combined oral contraceptive pill]]s. The size of the breasts can also increase and decrease in response to [[body weight|weight]] fluctuations. Physical changes to the breasts are often recorded in the [[stretch marks]] of the skin envelope; they can serve as historical indicators of the increments and the decrements of the size and volume of a woman's breasts throughout the course of her life.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n==Breastfeeding==\n{{Main|Breastfeeding}}\n\nThe primary function of the breasts, as mammary glands, is the nourishing of an infant with [[breast milk]]. Milk is produced in milk-secreting cells in the alveoli. When the breasts are stimulated by the suckling of her baby, the mother's brain secretes [[oxytocin]]. High levels of oxytocin trigger the contraction of muscle cells surrounding the alveoli, causing milk to flow along the ducts that connect the alveoli to the nipple.<ref name=\"NCBI Bookshelf 2008\">{{cite web | title=The physiological basis of breastfeeding | website=NCBI Bookshelf | date=5 November 2008 | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK148970/ | access-date=13 February 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119051121/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK148970/ | archive-date=19 January 2018 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}\n</ref>\n\nFull-term newborns have an instinct and a need to suck on a nipple, and breastfed babies nurse for both nutrition and for comfort.{{sfn|Lawrence|2016|p=201}}  Breast milk provides all necessary nutrients for the first six months of life, and then remains an important source of nutrition, alongside solid foods, until at least one or two years of age.\n\n==Clinical significance==\n{{Main|Breast disease}}\n\nThe breast is susceptible to numerous benign and malignant conditions. The most frequent benign conditions are [[puerperal mastitis]], [[fibrocystic breast changes]] and [[mastalgia]].\n\n[[Lactation]] unrelated to pregnancy is known as [[galactorrhea]].

A typical example is the so-called [[Venus of Willendorf]], one of many [[Paleolithic]] [[Venus figurines]] with ample hips and bosom. Artifacts such as bowls, rock carvings and sacred statues with breasts have been recorded from 15,000&nbsp;BC up to late antiquity all across Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.\n\nMany female deities representing love and fertility were associated with breasts and breast milk. Figures of the Phoenician goddess [[Astarte]] were represented as pillars studded with breasts. [[Isis]], an Egyptian goddess who represented, among many other things, ideal motherhood, was often portrayed as suckling [[pharaohs]], thereby confirming their divine status as rulers. Even certain male deities representing regeneration and fertility were occasionally depicted with breast-like appendices, such as the river god [[Hapy]] who was considered to be responsible for the annual overflowing of the [[Nile]].\n\nFemale breasts were also prominent in the [[Minoan civilization]] in the form of the famous [[Snake Goddess]] statuettes. In [[Ancient Greece]] there were several cults worshipping the \"Kourotrophos\", the suckling mother, represented by goddesses such as [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], [[Hera]] and [[Artemis]]. The worship of deities symbolized by the female breast in Greece became less common during the first millennium. The popular adoration of female goddesses decreased significantly during the rise of the Greek city states, a legacy which was passed on to the later [[Roman Empire]].<ref>Yalom (1998) pp. 9\u201316; see Eva Keuls (1993), ''Reign of the Phallus: Sexual Politics in Ancient Athens'' for a detailed study of male-dominant rule in ancient Greece.</ref>\n\nDuring the middle of the first millennium BC, Greek culture experienced a gradual change in the perception of female breasts. Women in art were covered in clothing from the neck down, including female goddesses like [[Athena]], the patron of Athens who represented heroic endeavor. There were exceptions: [[Aphrodite]], the goddess of love, was more frequently portrayed fully nude, though in postures that were intended to portray shyness or modesty, a portrayal that has been compared to modern [[Pin-up|pin ups]] by historian [[Marilyn Yalom]].<ref>Yalom (1998), p. 18.</ref> Although nude men were depicted standing upright, most depictions of female nudity in Greek art occurred \"usually with drapery near at hand and with a forward-bending, self-protecting posture\".<ref>Hollander (1993), p. 6.</ref> A popular legend at the time was of the [[Amazons]], a tribe of fierce female warriors who socialized with men only for procreation and even removed one breast to become better warriors (the idea being that the right breast would interfere with the operation of a bow and arrow). The legend was a popular motif in art during Greek and Roman antiquity and served as an antithetical cautionary tale.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:\u0398\u03b5\u03ac \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u038c\u03c6\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd 6393.JPG|A [[Minoan snake goddess figurines|Cretan snake goddess]] from the [[Minoan civilization]], {{circa|1600}}&nbsp;BC\nFile:Robert Dampier's oil on canvas painting 'Tetuppa, a Native Female of the Sandwich Islands', 1825.jpg|1825 oil painting entitled ''Tetuppa, a Native Female of the Sandwich Islands'', by [[Robert Dampier]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Body image===\nMany women regard their breasts as important to their [[sexual attractiveness]], as a sign of [[femininity]] that is important to their [[Self-concept|sense of self]].\n\n===Clothing===\n{{See also|Brassiere|Cleavage (breasts)|Toplessness|Modesty|Naturism|Exhibitionism}}\n[[File:Namibie Himba 0716a.jpg|thumb|upright|As is customary in her culture, a bare-breasted [[Himba people|Himba]] woman of northern Namibia wears a traditional headdress and skirt]]\n\nBecause breasts are mostly fatty tissue, their shape can\u2014within limits\u2014be molded by clothing, such as [[foundation garment]]s.

The [[nipple]] of the breast is surrounded by the [[areola]] (nipple-areola complex). The areola has many sebaceous glands, and the skin color varies from pink to dark brown. The basic units of the breast are the terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs), which produce the fatty breast milk. They give the breast its offspring-feeding functions as a mammary gland. They are distributed throughout the body of the breast. Approximately two-thirds of the lactiferous tissue is within 30&nbsp;mm of the base of the nipple. The terminal lactiferous ducts drain the milk from TDLUs into 4\u201318 lactiferous ducts, which drain to the nipple. The milk-glands-to-fat ratio is 2:1 in a lactating woman, and 1:1 in a non-lactating woman. In addition to the milk glands, the breast is also composed of connective tissues ([[collagen]], [[elastin]]), white fat, and the suspensory Cooper's ligaments. Sensation in the breast is provided by the [[peripheral nervous system]] innervation by means of the front (anterior) and side (lateral) cutaneous branches of the fourth-, fifth-, and sixth [[intercostal nerves]]. The T-4 nerve ([[Thoracic spinal nerve 4]]), which innervates the [[dermatomic area]], supplies sensation to the nipple-areola complex.<ref name=grabowski>{{cite book |first1 = Gerard J. |last1 = Tortora |first2 = Sandra Reynolds |last2 = Grabowski |title = Introduction to the Human Body: the Essentials of Anatomy and Physiology |date = 2001 |publisher = J.

The [[axillary lymph node]]s include the pectoral (chest), subscapular (under the scapula), and humeral (humerus-bone area) lymph-node groups, which drain to the central [[axillary lymph nodes]] and to the apical axillary lymph nodes. The lymphatic drainage of the breasts is especially relevant to [[oncology]] because breast cancer is common to the mammary gland, and cancer cells can [[Metastasis|metastasize]] (break away) from a [[tumour]] and be dispersed to other parts of the body by means of the lymphatic system.\n\n===Shape, texture, and support===\nThe morphologic variations in the size, shape, volume, tissue density, pectoral locale, and spacing of the breasts determine their natural shape, appearance, and position on a woman's chest. Breast size and other characteristics do not predict the fat-to-milk-gland ratio or the potential for the woman to nurse an infant.

By mid-pregnancy, the breast is physiologically capable of lactation and some women can express [[colostrum]], a form of breast milk.{{sfn | Lawrence | 2016 | p=58}}\n\nPregnancy causes elevated levels of the hormone [[prolactin]], which has a key role in the production of milk. However, milk production is blocked by the hormones [[progesterone]] and [[estrogen]] until after delivery, when progesterone and estrogen levels plummet.<ref name=\"NCBI Bookshelf 2008\"/>\n\n===Menopause===\n\nAt menopause, breast atrophy occurs. The breasts can decrease in size when the levels of circulating estrogen decline. The adipose tissue and milk glands also begin to wither. The breasts can also become enlarged from [[Adverse effect|adverse side effect]]<nowiki/>s of [[combined oral contraceptive pill]]s. The size of the breasts can also increase and decrease in response to [[body weight|weight]] fluctuations. Physical changes to the breasts are often recorded in the [[stretch marks]] of the skin envelope; they can serve as historical indicators of the increments and the decrements of the size and volume of a woman's breasts throughout the course of her life.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n==Breastfeeding==\n{{Main|Breastfeeding}}\n\nThe primary function of the breasts, as mammary glands, is the nourishing of an infant with [[breast milk]]. Milk is produced in milk-secreting cells in the alveoli. When the breasts are stimulated by the suckling of her baby, the mother's brain secretes [[oxytocin]]. High levels of oxytocin trigger the contraction of muscle cells surrounding the alveoli, causing milk to flow along the ducts that connect the alveoli to the nipple.<ref name=\"NCBI Bookshelf 2008\">{{cite web | title=The physiological basis of breastfeeding | website=NCBI Bookshelf | date=5 November 2008 | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK148970/ | access-date=13 February 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119051121/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK148970/ | archive-date=19 January 2018 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}\n</ref>\n\nFull-term newborns have an instinct and a need to suck on a nipple, and breastfed babies nurse for both nutrition and for comfort.{{sfn|Lawrence|2016|p=201}}  Breast milk provides all necessary nutrients for the first six months of life, and then remains an important source of nutrition, alongside solid foods, until at least one or two years of age.\n\n==Clinical significance==\n{{Main|Breast disease}}\n\nThe breast is susceptible to numerous benign and malignant conditions. The most frequent benign conditions are [[puerperal mastitis]], [[fibrocystic breast changes]] and [[mastalgia]].\n\n[[Lactation]] unrelated to pregnancy is known as [[galactorrhea]]. It can be caused by certain drugs (such as [[antipsychotic]] medications), extreme physical stress, or [[endocrine]] disorders. Lactation in newborns is caused by hormones from the mother that crossed into the baby's bloodstream during pregnancy.\n\n===Breast cancer===\n{{Main|Breast cancer}}\nBreast cancer is the most common cause of cancer death among women<ref>\n{{cite web |author = World Health Organization |date = February 2006 |title = Fact sheet No. 297: Cancer |url = http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en/index.html |accessdate = 26 April 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140213212322/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en/index.html |archive-date = 13 February 2014 |url-status = live |df = dmy-all |author-link = World Health Organization }}\n</ref> and it is one of the leading causes of death among women.

A typical example is the so-called [[Venus of Willendorf]], one of many [[Paleolithic]] [[Venus figurines]] with ample hips and bosom. Artifacts such as bowls, rock carvings and sacred statues with breasts have been recorded from 15,000&nbsp;BC up to late antiquity all across Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.\n\nMany female deities representing love and fertility were associated with breasts and breast milk. Figures of the Phoenician goddess [[Astarte]] were represented as pillars studded with breasts. [[Isis]], an Egyptian goddess who represented, among many other things, ideal motherhood, was often portrayed as suckling [[pharaohs]], thereby confirming their divine status as rulers. Even certain male deities representing regeneration and fertility were occasionally depicted with breast-like appendices, such as the river god [[Hapy]] who was considered to be responsible for the annual overflowing of the [[Nile]].\n\nFemale breasts were also prominent in the [[Minoan civilization]] in the form of the famous [[Snake Goddess]] statuettes. In [[Ancient Greece]] there were several cults worshipping the \"Kourotrophos\", the suckling mother, represented by goddesses such as [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], [[Hera]] and [[Artemis]]. The worship of deities symbolized by the female breast in Greece became less common during the first millennium. The popular adoration of female goddesses decreased significantly during the rise of the Greek city states, a legacy which was passed on to the later [[Roman Empire]].<ref>Yalom (1998) pp. 9\u201316; see Eva Keuls (1993), ''Reign of the Phallus: Sexual Politics in Ancient Athens'' for a detailed study of male-dominant rule in ancient Greece.</ref>\n\nDuring the middle of the first millennium BC, Greek culture experienced a gradual change in the perception of female breasts. Women in art were covered in clothing from the neck down, including female goddesses like [[Athena]], the patron of Athens who represented heroic endeavor. There were exceptions: [[Aphrodite]], the goddess of love, was more frequently portrayed fully nude, though in postures that were intended to portray shyness or modesty, a portrayal that has been compared to modern [[Pin-up|pin ups]] by historian [[Marilyn Yalom]].<ref>Yalom (1998), p. 18.</ref> Although nude men were depicted standing upright, most depictions of female nudity in Greek art occurred \"usually with drapery near at hand and with a forward-bending, self-protecting posture\".<ref>Hollander (1993), p. 6.</ref> A popular legend at the time was of the [[Amazons]], a tribe of fierce female warriors who socialized with men only for procreation and even removed one breast to become better warriors (the idea being that the right breast would interfere with the operation of a bow and arrow). The legend was a popular motif in art during Greek and Roman antiquity and served as an antithetical cautionary tale.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:\u0398\u03b5\u03ac \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u038c\u03c6\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd 6393.JPG|A [[Minoan snake goddess figurines|Cretan snake goddess]] from the [[Minoan civilization]], {{circa|1600}}&nbsp;BC\nFile:Robert Dampier's oil on canvas painting 'Tetuppa, a Native Female of the Sandwich Islands', 1825.jpg|1825 oil painting entitled ''Tetuppa, a Native Female of the Sandwich Islands'', by [[Robert Dampier]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Body image===\nMany women regard their breasts as important to their [[sexual attractiveness]], as a sign of [[femininity]] that is important to their [[Self-concept|sense of self]].\n\n===Clothing===\n{{See also|Brassiere|Cleavage (breasts)|Toplessness|Modesty|Naturism|Exhibitionism}}\n[[File:Namibie Himba 0716a.jpg|thumb|upright|As is customary in her culture, a bare-breasted [[Himba people|Himba]] woman of northern Namibia wears a traditional headdress and skirt]]\n\nBecause breasts are mostly fatty tissue, their shape can -within limits- be molded by clothing, such as [[foundation garment]]s.
