What's really for dinner? The truth about commercial pet food. The Animals' Agenda. 1996. Nov. - Dec.</ref> \n\n==History==\nThe idea of preparing specialized food for cats came later than for dogs (see [[dog biscuit]]s and [[dog food]]). This was likely due to the idea that cats could readily fend for themselves. In 1837, a French writer Mauny de Mornay critiqued this idea:\n\n{{quote|text=It is... thought wrongly that the cat, ill-fed, hunts better and takes more mice; this too is a grave error. The cat who is not given food is feeble and sickly; as soon as he has bitten into a mouse, he lies down to rest and sleep; while well fed, he is wide awake and satisfies his natural taste in chasing all that belongs to the rat family.<ref>Mauny de Mornay, ''Livre de l'eleveur et du proprietaire d'animaux domestiques'' 1837 https://books.google.com/books?printsec=frontcover&pg=PA287&id=tBkGwxXqxpgC&num=100&as_brr=1&f=false</ref>}}\n\nIn 1844, another French writer{{Who|date=February 2015}} expanded on this idea:\n{{quote|text=Normally in the country no care is taken of a cat's food, and he is left to live, it is said, from his hunting, but when he is hungry, he hunts the pantry's provisions far more than the mouse; because he does not pursue them and never watches them by need, but by instinct and attraction. And so, to neglect feeding a cat, is to render him at the same time useless and harmful, while with a few scraps regularly and properly given, the cat will never do any damage, and will render much service.<ref>Nicolas Jean Baptiste Boyard, ''Manuel du bouvier et zoophile: ou l'art d'\u00e9lever de soigner les animaux '' 1844 https://books.google.com/books?pg=RA2-PA328&id=ODpFAAAAYAAJ&num=100&as_brr=1&q=intitle%3A%22animaux%20domestiques%22%20chat&f=false</ref>}}\n\nHe goes on to say that it is all the more unreasonable to expect a cat to live from hunting in that cats take mice more for amusement than to eat: \"A good cat takes many and eats few\".\n\nBy 1876, Gordon Stables emphasized the need to give cats particular food:\n\n{{quote|text=If then, only for the sake of making (a cat) more valuable as a vermin-killer, she ought to have regular and sufficient food. A cat ought to be fed at least twice a day. Let her have a dish to herself, put down to her, and removed when the meal is finished. [[Experience is the best teacher]] as regards the quantity of a cat's food, and in quality let it be varied. Oatmeal porridge and milk, or white bread steeped in warm milk, to which a little sugar has been added, are both excellent breakfasts for puss; and for dinner she must have an allowance of flesh. Boiled lights are better for her than horse-meat, and occasionally let her have fish. Teach your cat to wait patiently till she is served\u2014a spoiled cat is nearly as disagreeable as a spoiled child. If you want to have your cat nice and clean, treat her now and then to a square inch of fresh butter. It not only acts as a gentle laxative, but, the grease, combining in her mouth, with the alkalinity of her saliva, forms a kind of natural cat-soap, and you will see she will immediately commence washing herself, and become beautifully clean. (N.B.\u2014If you wish to have a cat nicely done up for showing, touch her all over with a sponge dipped in fresh cream, when she licks herself the effect is wonderful.)\n\nRemember that too much flesh-meat, especially liver,\u2014which ought only to be given occasionally,\u2014is very apt to induce a troublesome diarrhoea (looseness). Do not give your pet too many tit-bits at table; but whatever else you give her, never neglect to let her have her ''two regular meals''.<ref>Gordon Stables,'' 'Cats': their points and characteristics, with Curiosities of cat life, and ...'' 1876 https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA371&id=iUUDAAAAQAAJ&num=100&as_brr=0&q=cat%20food%20%22cat%20food%22&f=false</ref>}}\n\nIn the same year, an advertisement for [[Spratt's|Spratt]] (better known for making dog food) said that their cat food entirely superseded \"the unwholesome practice of feeding on boiled horse flesh; keeps the cat in perfect health.\"<ref>ad for Spratt's https://books.google.com/books?id=5-ANAAAAQAAJ&pg=PP8</ref> And, in another book on cats, Stables recommended the company's food:\n\n{{quote|text=Attend to the feeding, and, at a more than one-day show, cats ought to have ''water'' as well as milk. I think boiled [[Lights (offal)|lights]], cut into small pieces, with a very small portion of bullock's liver and bread soaked, is the best food; but I have tried Spratt's Patent Cat Food with a great number of cats, both of my own and those of friends, and have nearly always found it agree; and at a cat show it would, I believe, be both handy and cleanly.<ref>Gordon Stable, ''The domestic cat'', 1876, 61 https://books.google.com/books?printsec=frontcover&pg=PA61&id=30oDAAAAQAAJ&num=100&as_brr=1&f=false</ref>}}\n\nSpratt, which began by making dog biscuits, appears to also have been the first commercial producer of cat food.\n\nDuring the 19th century and early 20th centuries, meat for cats and dogs in London, frequently [[horse meat]], was sold from barrows (hand\u2013carts) by itinerant traders known as ''Cats' Meat Men''.<ref name=\":18\">{{cite web | url=http://www.museumoflondonprints.com/image/68598/john-galt-cats-meat-man-c-1901 | title=Cats' Meat Man: c.1901 | publisher=Museum of London | accessdate=October 2, 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Natural diet ==\nCats are obligate [[carnivore]]s\u2014meaning, they are true carnivores and depend upon the nutrients present in animal flesh for their dietary needs. Even domesticated cats will relish freshly killed meat from rodents, rabbits, amphibians, birds, reptiles and fish, but cats are also opportunistic feeders and will readily take cooked food<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.timeforpaws.co.uk/blog/wild-cats/|title = Wild Cats Survive - Time for Paws - Time for Paws|website = Time for Paws|language = en-GB|access-date = 2016-03-08}}</ref> as well as dried cat food when offered, if that food is palatable. The natural diet of cats therefore does not include any vegetable matter, although cats have been known to eat certain plants and grasses occasionally, usually as an [[Vomiting|emetic]].\n\nCats cannot synthesize some essential nutrients required for survival, including the amino acids [[taurine]] and [[arginine]], so these nutrients must be sourced from fresh meat in the natural diet. Cats lack the specific physiology to extract nutrients efficiently from plant-based materials, and require a high protein diet, which is why high-energy meats from freshly killed prey are optimal foods.\n\n==Packaging and labeling==\n{{further|Pet food#Labeling and regulation}}\nIn the United States, cat foods labeled as \"complete and balanced\" must meet standards established by the [[Association of American Feed Control Officials]] (AAFCO) either by meeting a nutrient profile or by passing a feeding trial. Cat Food Nutrient Profiles were established in 1992 and updated in 2014 by the AAFCO's Feline Nutrition Expert Subcommittee. The updated profiles replaced the previous recommendations set by the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] (NRC). Certain manufacturers label their products with terms such as premium, ultra premium, natural and holistic. Such terms currently have no legal definitions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://petfood.aafco.org/Labeling-Labeling-Requirements|title=The Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) > Labeling & Labeling Requirements|website=petfood.aafco.org|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref> However, \"While most of the food supplied comes from within the US, the FDA ensures that standards are met within our borders even when components come from countries with less stringent levels of safety or label integrity.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://petfoodtalk.com/catfoodreviews/#cat-food | title = Cat Food Reviews: The Pleasure of Their Company | publisher=petfoodtalk.com}}</ref>\n\n==Commercial cat food diets==\n\nMost store-bought cat food comes in either dry form, also known in the US as ''kibble'', or wet canned form.

Fat may then be sprayed on the food to increase [[palatability]], and other minor ingredients, such as heat-sensitive vitamins, which would be destroyed in the extrusion process, may be added. Dry food is most often packed in multi-wall [[paper bag]]s, sometimes with a [[plastic film]] layer; similar bag styles with film laminates or coextrusions are also used.\n\n===Wet food diet===\n[[File:Canned Cat Food1.jpg|right|thumb|Wet (canned) cat food example (Fish flakes in jelly)]]\nIn much of Europe, the UK and the US, [[canning|canned]] or wet food (75\u201378% moisture) generally comes in aluminum or steel cans in 3 [[ounce|oz]] (85 g), 5.5 oz (156 g), and 13 oz (369 g) sizes.

Weight gain means more energy is being consumed than is being expended in exercise and other functions. A weight management diet is designed to allow fewer calories to be consumed in a larger volume of food, allowing for less risk of an energy imbalance. \n\nAdult cats should be fed a diet that promotes maintaining a healthy weight, while at the same time meeting the individual taste preference of the cat. Cats generally prefer to eat smaller meals more frequently, which can lead to less weight gain compared to cats that are fed free-choice (always available) food. Meanwhile, some cats adapt to free-choice feeding and can maintain normal body weight with no weight gain.<ref name=\":6\" /> In general, indoor cats have less opportunity or need for exercise than outdoor cats; indoor cats are much more prone to weight gain. For indoor cats, there are a variety of choices to promote exercise, including various cat toys designed to stimulate chase and play behaviours.<ref name=\":6\" /> Overall, if an adult cat cannot maintain normal body condition on a free-choice feeding diet, despite exercise levels, portion-controlled feeding is recommended. Many pet cats are fed energy-dense, high carbohydrate diets, which provide much more energy than needed. This is a major issue with indoor cats as it has been shown to lead to obesity. To prevent cats from becoming overweight, owners should be more inclined to implement weight control diets, which provide the cat with nutrient-dense, low energy ingredients.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Spofford|first=N|date=2014|title=A moderate fat, low-energy dry expanded diet reduces gain in body condition score when fed as part of a post neutering weight-control regimen in growing pet cats|url=|journal=Journal of Nutritional Science|volume=3|pages=e40|doi=10.1017/jns.2014.48|pmid=26101609|pmc=4473151}}</ref> Studies show that cats fed lower energy diets have significantly reduced incidences of obesity, as the typical indoor pet cat does not need more energy than their resting energy requirement. For an average cat weighing 10-11 pounds (about 5&nbsp;kg), it would have a resting energy requirement of 180-200 kcal/day.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Montes de Oca|first=M|date=2017|title=Prediction equations for metabolizable and digestible energy in feline diets|url=|journal=Animal Feed Science and Technology|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nAlong with energy input and output, specific nutrients can be important in weight control diets. Fiber is an important component that helps control weight, along with various other benefits. A source of soluble and fermentable fiber helps to increase the movement of digesta through the gut and decrease gastric emptying. This helps to increase satiety in cats, potentially decreasing feeding rates and voluntary energy consumption. Fermentable fiber promotes healthy mucosa and [[commensal bacteria]]l growth and improved digestion/nutrient absorption. Prebiotic fibers like [[fructooligosaccharide]]s (FOS) and mannonoligosaccharides (MOS) decrease the number of pathogenic bacteria and increase the number of beneficial bacteria in the gut. They also help to maintain microbial balance and a healthy immune system. Fiber is fermented in the colon to produce short-chain fatty acids which can be used as an energy source. Fermentable fiber has been demonstrated to enhance general health and decrease inflammation.<ref name=\":18\" /> Furthermore, non-fermentable fiber is critical to the formation of well-formed stool, and has been known to increase diet bulk while decreasing caloric density. Insoluble fiber has been proposed to regulate appetite by releasing hormones that reduce hunger. Sources of fiber commonly added in weight management cat food include beet pulp, barley, [[psyllium]] and [[cellulose]].\n\nAnother nutrient important for weight control diets is protein and its component amino acids. Felines, being obligate carnivores, require a natural diet of animal products which consists of protein and fat (i.e. muscle, organs and animal tissue). Dietary protein supplies amino acids that can be utilized and metabolised as energy before using fat stores,  even though protein is not stored in the body the same way as fat.<ref name=\":6\" /> Dietary fat is more efficiently converted to body fat than protein; if an animal is consuming more than its energy requirement and if the excess energy is provided by fat, more weight will be gained than if the excess calories are coming from protein.<ref name=\":6\" /> Dietary protein also improves satiety during feed, resulting in decreased overconsumption of food.<ref name=\":6\" /> The protein content of the diet is a key factor in building and maintaining lean body (muscle) mass, which is an important aspect of weight control. Lean body mass maintenance is regulated by protein intake, but more importantly is regulated by exercise. Limited protein and amino acids in the diet will limit lean body mass growth, but exercise or lack of exercise will allow growth or shrinking of muscle. Successful weight control involves maintenance of healthy adipose tissue levels, but most importantly maintenance of lean body mass. Lean muscle is the driver of basal energy metabolism and aids in the use of energy. When sufficient levels of fat are provided, fat will be used by the body as an energy source, but only when there are insufficient levels of protein.\n\nAn important amino acid that is incorporated many weight loss/weight control diets is [[L-carnitine]]. This is a vitamin-like substance that is found in animal protein. It can be found in ingredients commonly used in more commercial pet foods, but specifically weight management/weight loss diets. L-carnitine is involved in many biological pathways, more specifically fatty acid metabolism, allowing for the conversion of long-chain fatty acids into energy. The introduction of L-carnitine ensures rapid transport and oxidation of fatty acids as well as efficient usage of dietary fatty acids and protein. Supplementary L-carnitine is used more often in weight loss diets, since its benefits mainly involve fatty acid metabolism to control weight loss. However, since weight control is, in essence, a prevention stage in overall weight management, it still has value in weight control diets in preserving and building lean body mass and inhibiting the storage of excess dietary fat. The majority of studies focusing on supplementary L-carnitine use look at its benefits for weight loss, including its effect on metabolic rate and fatty acid oxidation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Center|first=SA|date=2012|title=Influence of dietary supplementation with (L)-carnitine on metabolic rate, fatty acid oxidation, body condition and weight loss in overweight cats|url=|journal=Cornell University: Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine|volume=73|issue=7|pages=1012\u20131015|pmid=22738052|doi=10.2460/ajvr.73.7.1002}}</ref> At the same time, these studies still show similar results that prove their{{clarify|date=December 2017}} effects of controlling fatty acid metabolism for weight control, to avoid the need for weight loss diets.\n\n===Grain-free diet===\nGrain free cat food substitutes the typical carbohydrate sources like wheat, corn or rice with alternative sources such as white potato, peas, sweet potato or tapioca. \n\nA study published in the Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery in 2018 compared the carbohydrate content between grain-free diets and diets containing grains. According to this study the proportion of cat food purchased that is grain free has increased from 4% to 9% between 2012\u20132014. <ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Prantil|first=Lori R.|last2=Heinze|first2=Cailin R.|last3=Freeman|first3=Lisa M.|date=2017-06-01|title=Comparison of carbohydrate content between grain-containing and grain-free dry cat diets and between reported and calculated carbohydrate values|journal=Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery|volume=20|issue=4|pages=349\u2013355|language=en|doi=10.1177/1098612X17710842|pmid=28569080}}</ref> The researchers at Tufts University analyzed the nutritional information and contents of 77 different dry cat food diets. 42 of these diets contained grain, while 35 were labeled as grain free.

It was found that the grain free diets had a lower mean carbohydrate content than the diets containing grain; however, there was a very wide range and lots of overlap between the two groups in both their carbohydrate contents. Sone grain free diets even had a higher amount of carbohydrates than the diets containing grain. Calorie amounts were similar for both diets. <ref name=\":7\" />\n\nA recent study published by the FDA has potentially linked grain free diets to [[dilated cardiomyopathy]] in both dogs and cats.

Plant sources do not contain enough of these. Vegetarian pet food companies try to correct these deficiencies by adding synthetically produced nutrients.<ref name=\"VT\"/>\n\nCats on a vegan diet can develop abnormally [[alkaline]] (high [[pH]]) urine as plant-based proteins are more alkaline than the meat-based foods which cats have evolved to eat. When the urine becomes too alkaline, there is an increased risk of formation of [[struvite]] (also known as magnesium ammonium phosphate) bladder crystals and/or stones. Calcium oxalate stones can also occur if the urine is too acidic. Such stones can create irritation and infection of the urinary tract and require veterinary treatment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.veganhealth.org/articles/vegan_cats |title=Vegan Cats |publisher=Veganhealth.org |accessdate=2014-08-10}}</ref>\n\nOrganizations that advocate vegan or vegetarian diets for people have split opinions regarding vegetarian or vegan cat food.

The [[Animal Protection Institute]] also does not recommend a vegetarian diet for cats, and cautions that dietary deficiencies may take months or years to develop and may be untreatable.

Arginine is essential in the urea cycle in order to convert the toxic component ammonia into urea that can then be excreted in the urine. Because of its essential role, deficiency in arginine results in a buildup of toxic ammonia and leads to [[hyperammonemia]]. The symptoms of hyperammonemia include lethargy, vomiting, ataxia, and hyperesthesia, and can be serious enough to induce death and coma in a matter of days if a cat is being fed an arginine-free diet. The quick onset of these symptoms is due to the fact that diets devoid in arginine will typically still contain all of the other amino acids, which will continue to be catabolized by the body,

What's really for dinner? The truth about commercial pet food. The Animals' Agenda. 1996. Nov. - Dec.</ref> \n\n==History==\nThe idea of preparing specialized food for cats came later than for dogs (see [[dog biscuit]]s and [[dog food]]). This was likely due to the idea that cats could readily fend for themselves. In 1837, a French writer Mauny de Mornay critiqued this idea:\n\n{{quote|text=It is... thought wrongly that the cat, ill-fed, hunts better and takes more mice; this too is a grave error. The cat who is not given food is feeble and sickly; as soon as he has bitten into a mouse, he lies down to rest and sleep; while well fed, he is wide awake and satisfies his natural taste in chasing all that belongs to the rat family.<ref>Mauny de Mornay, ''Livre de l'eleveur et du proprietaire d'animaux domestiques'' 1837 https://books.google.com/books?printsec=frontcover&pg=PA287&id=tBkGwxXqxpgC&num=100&as_brr=1&f=false</ref>}}\n\nIn 1844, another French writer{{Who|date=February 2015}} expanded on this idea:\n{{quote|text=Normally in the country no care is taken of a cat's food, and he is left to live, it is said, from his hunting, but when he is hungry, he hunts the pantry's provisions far more than the mouse; because he does not pursue them and never watches them by need, but by instinct and attraction. And so, to neglect feeding a cat, is to render him at the same time useless and harmful, while with a few scraps regularly and properly given, the cat will never do any damage, and will render much service.<ref>Nicolas Jean Baptiste Boyard, ''Manuel du bouvier et zoophile: ou l'art d'\u00e9lever de soigner les animaux '' 1844 https://books.google.com/books?pg=RA2-PA328&id=ODpFAAAAYAAJ&num=100&as_brr=1&q=intitle%3A%22animaux%20domestiques%22%20chat&f=false</ref>}}\n\nHe goes on to say that it is all the more unreasonable to expect a cat to live from hunting in that cats take mice more for amusement than to eat: \"A good cat takes many and eats few\".\n\nBy 1876, Gordon Stables emphasized the need to give cats particular food:\n\n{{quote|text=If then, only for the sake of making (a cat) more valuable as a vermin-killer, she ought to have regular and sufficient food. A cat ought to be fed at least twice a day. Let her have a dish to herself, put down to her, and removed when the meal is finished. [[Experience is the best teacher]] as regards the quantity of a cat's food, and in quality let it be varied. Oatmeal porridge and milk, or white bread steeped in warm milk, to which a little sugar has been added, are both excellent breakfasts for puss; and for dinner she must have an allowance of flesh. Boiled lights are better for her than horse-meat, and occasionally let her have fish. Teach your cat to wait patiently till she is served\u2014a spoiled cat is nearly as disagreeable as a spoiled child. If you want to have your cat nice and clean, treat her now and then to a square inch of fresh butter. It not only acts as a gentle laxative, but, the grease, combining in her mouth, with the alkalinity of her saliva, forms a kind of natural cat-soap, and you will see she will immediately commence washing herself, and become beautifully clean. (N.B.\u2014If you wish to have a cat nicely done up for showing, touch her all over with a sponge dipped in fresh cream, when she licks herself the effect is wonderful.)\n\nRemember that too much flesh-meat, especially liver,\u2014which ought only to be given occasionally,\u2014is very apt to induce a troublesome diarrhoea (looseness). Do not give your pet too many tit-bits at table; but whatever else you give her, never neglect to let her have her ''two regular meals''.<ref>Gordon Stables,'' 'Cats': their points and characteristics, with Curiosities of cat life, and ...'' 1876 https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA371&id=iUUDAAAAQAAJ&num=100&as_brr=0&q=cat%20food%20%22cat%20food%22&f=false</ref>}}\n\nIn the same year, an advertisement for [[Spratt's|Spratt]] (better known for making dog food) said that their cat food entirely superseded \"the unwholesome practice of feeding on boiled horse flesh; keeps the cat in perfect health.\"<ref>ad for Spratt's https://books.google.com/books?id=5-ANAAAAQAAJ&pg=PP8</ref> And, in another book on cats, Stables recommended the company's food:\n\n{{quote|text=Attend to the feeding, and, at a more than one-day show, cats ought to have ''water'' as well as milk. I think boiled [[Lights (offal)|lights]], cut into small pieces, with a very small portion of bullock's liver and bread soaked, is the best food; but I have tried Spratt's Patent Cat Food with a great number of cats, both of my own and those of friends, and have nearly always found it agree; and at a cat show it would, I believe, be both handy and cleanly.<ref>Gordon Stable, ''The domestic cat'', 1876, 61 https://books.google.com/books?printsec=frontcover&pg=PA61&id=30oDAAAAQAAJ&num=100&as_brr=1&f=false</ref>}}\n\nSpratt, which began by making dog biscuits, appears to also have been the first commercial producer of cat food.\n\nDuring the 19th century and early 20th centuries, meat for cats and dogs in London, frequently [[horse meat]], was sold from barrows (hand\u2013carts) by itinerant traders known as ''Cats' Meat Men''.<ref name=\":18\">{{cite web | url=http://www.museumoflondonprints.com/image/68598/john-galt-cats-meat-man-c-1901 | title=Cats' Meat Man: c.1901 | publisher=Museum of London | accessdate=October 2, 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Natural diet ==\nCats are obligate [[carnivore]]s\u2014meaning, they are true carnivores and depend upon the nutrients present in animal flesh for their dietary needs. Even domesticated cats will relish freshly killed meat from rodents, rabbits, amphibians, birds, reptiles and fish, but cats are also opportunistic feeders and will readily take cooked food<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.timeforpaws.co.uk/blog/wild-cats/|title = Wild Cats Survive - Time for Paws - Time for Paws|website = Time for Paws|language = en-GB|access-date = 2016-03-08}}</ref> as well as dried cat food when offered, if that food is palatable. The natural diet of cats therefore does not include any vegetable matter, although cats have been known to eat certain plants and grasses occasionally, usually as an [[Vomiting|emetic]].\n\nCats cannot synthesize some essential nutrients required for survival, including the amino acids [[taurine]] and [[arginine]], so these nutrients must be sourced from fresh meat in the natural diet. Cats lack the specific physiology to extract nutrients efficiently from plant-based materials, and require a high protein diet, which is why high-energy meats from freshly killed prey are optimal foods.\n\n==Packaging and labeling==\n{{further|Pet food#Labeling and regulation}}\nIn the United States, cat foods labeled as \"complete and balanced\" must meet standards established by the [[Association of American Feed Control Officials]] (AAFCO) either by meeting a nutrient profile or by passing a feeding trial. Cat Food Nutrient Profiles were established in 1992 and updated in 2014 by the AAFCO's Feline Nutrition Expert Subcommittee. The updated profiles replaced the previous recommendations set by the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] (NRC). Certain manufacturers label their products with terms such as premium, ultra premium, natural and holistic. Such terms currently have no legal definitions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://petfood.aafco.org/Labeling-Labeling-Requirements|title=The Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) > Labeling & Labeling Requirements|website=petfood.aafco.org|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref> However, \"While most of the food supplied comes from within the US, the FDA ensures that standards are met within our borders even when components come from countries with less stringent levels of safety or label integrity.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://petfoodtalk.com/catfoodreviews/#cat-food | title = Cat Food Reviews: The Pleasure of Their Company | publisher=petfoodtalk.com}}</ref>\n\n==Commercial cat food diets==\n\nMost store-bought cat food comes in either dry form, also known in the US as ''kibble'', or wet canned form. Some manufacturers sell frozen raw diets and premix products to cater to owners who [[raw feeding|feed raw]].\n\n===Dry food diet===\n[[File:Katzenfutter.JPG|left|thumb|Dry (extruded) cat food example]]\nDry food (8\u201310% moisture) is generally made by [[Food extrusion|extrusion]] cooking under high heat and pressure. Fat may then be sprayed on the food to increase [[palatability]], and other minor ingredients, such as heat-sensitive vitamins, which would be destroyed in the extrusion process, may be added. Dry food is most often packed in multi-wall [[paper bag]]s, sometimes with a [[plastic film]] layer; similar bag styles with film laminates or coextrusions are also used.\n\n===Wet food diet===\n[[File:Canned Cat Food1.jpg|right|thumb|Wet (canned) cat food example (Fish flakes in jelly)]]\nIn much of Europe, the UK and the US, [[canning|canned]] or wet food (75\u201378% moisture) generally comes in aluminum or steel cans in 3 [[ounce|oz]] (85 g), 5.5 oz (156 g), and 13 oz (369 g) sizes.

Weight gain means more energy is being consumed than is being expended in exercise and other functions. A weight management diet is designed to allow fewer calories to be consumed in a larger volume of food, allowing for less risk of an energy imbalance. \n\nAdult cats should be fed a diet that promotes maintaining a healthy weight, while at the same time meeting the individual taste preference of the cat. Cats generally prefer to eat smaller meals more frequently, which can lead to less weight gain compared to cats that are fed free-choice (always available) food. Meanwhile, some cats adapt to free-choice feeding and can maintain normal body weight with no weight gain.<ref name=\":6\" /> In general, indoor cats have less opportunity or need for exercise than outdoor cats; indoor cats are much more prone to weight gain. For indoor cats, there are a variety of choices to promote exercise, including various cat toys designed to stimulate chase and play behaviours.<ref name=\":6\" /> Overall, if an adult cat cannot maintain normal body condition on a free-choice feeding diet, despite exercise levels, portion-controlled feeding is recommended. Many pet cats are fed energy-dense, high carbohydrate diets, which provide much more energy than needed. This is a major issue with indoor cats as it has been shown to lead to obesity. To prevent cats from becoming overweight, owners should be more inclined to implement weight control diets, which provide the cat with nutrient-dense, low energy ingredients.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Spofford|first=N|date=2014|title=A moderate fat, low-energy dry expanded diet reduces gain in body condition score when fed as part of a post neutering weight-control regimen in growing pet cats|url=|journal=Journal of Nutritional Science|volume=3|pages=e40|doi=10.1017/jns.2014.48|pmid=26101609|pmc=4473151}}</ref> Studies show that cats fed lower energy diets have significantly reduced incidences of obesity, as the typical indoor pet cat does not need more energy than their resting energy requirement. For an average cat weighing 10-11 pounds (about 5&nbsp;kg), it would have a resting energy requirement of 180-200 kcal/day.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Montes de Oca|first=M|date=2017|title=Prediction equations for metabolizable and digestible energy in feline diets|url=|journal=Animal Feed Science and Technology|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nAlong with energy input and output, specific nutrients can be important in weight control diets. Fiber is an important component that helps control weight, along with various other benefits. A source of soluble and fermentable fiber helps to increase the movement of digesta through the gut and decrease gastric emptying. This helps to increase satiety in cats, potentially decreasing feeding rates and voluntary energy consumption. Fermentable fiber promotes healthy mucosa and [[commensal bacteria]]l growth and improved digestion/nutrient absorption. Prebiotic fibers like [[fructooligosaccharide]]s (FOS) and mannonoligosaccharides (MOS) decrease the number of pathogenic bacteria and increase the number of beneficial bacteria in the gut. They also help to maintain microbial balance and a healthy immune system. Fiber is fermented in the colon to produce short-chain fatty acids which can be used as an energy source. Fermentable fiber has been demonstrated to enhance general health and decrease inflammation.<ref name=\":18\" /> Furthermore, non-fermentable fiber is critical to the formation of well-formed stool, and has been known to increase diet bulk while decreasing caloric density. Insoluble fiber has been proposed to regulate appetite by releasing hormones that reduce hunger. Sources of fiber commonly added in weight management cat food include beet pulp, barley, [[psyllium]] and [[cellulose]].\n\nAnother nutrient important for weight control diets is protein and its component amino acids. Felines, being obligate carnivores, require a natural diet of animal products which consists of protein and fat (i.e. muscle, organs and animal tissue). Dietary protein supplies amino acids that can be utilized and metabolised as energy before using fat stores,  even though protein is not stored in the body the same way as fat.<ref name=\":6\" /> Dietary fat is more efficiently converted to body fat than protein; if an animal is consuming more than its energy requirement and if the excess energy is provided by fat, more weight will be gained than if the excess calories are coming from protein.<ref name=\":6\" /> Dietary protein also improves satiety during feed, resulting in decreased overconsumption of food.<ref name=\":6\" /> The protein content of the diet is a key factor in building and maintaining lean body (muscle) mass, which is an important aspect of weight control. Lean body mass maintenance is regulated by protein intake, but more importantly is regulated by exercise. Limited protein and amino acids in the diet will limit lean body mass growth, but exercise or lack of exercise will allow growth or shrinking of muscle. Successful weight control involves maintenance of healthy adipose tissue levels, but most importantly maintenance of lean body mass. Lean muscle is the driver of basal energy metabolism and aids in the use of energy. When sufficient levels of fat are provided, fat will be used by the body as an energy source, but only when there are insufficient levels of protein.\n\nAn important amino acid that is incorporated many weight loss/weight control diets is [[L-carnitine]]. This is a vitamin-like substance that is found in animal protein. It can be found in ingredients commonly used in more commercial pet foods, but specifically weight management/weight loss diets. L-carnitine is involved in many biological pathways, more specifically fatty acid metabolism, allowing for the conversion of long-chain fatty acids into energy. The introduction of L-carnitine ensures rapid transport and oxidation of fatty acids as well as efficient usage of dietary fatty acids and protein. Supplementary L-carnitine is used more often in weight loss diets, since its benefits mainly involve fatty acid metabolism to control weight loss. However, since weight control is, in essence, a prevention stage in overall weight management, it still has value in weight control diets in preserving and building lean body mass and inhibiting the storage of excess dietary fat. The majority of studies focusing on supplementary L-carnitine use look at its benefits for weight loss, including its effect on metabolic rate and fatty acid oxidation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Center|first=SA|date=2012|title=Influence of dietary supplementation with (L)-carnitine on metabolic rate, fatty acid oxidation, body condition and weight loss in overweight cats|url=|journal=Cornell University: Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine|volume=73|issue=7|pages=1012\u20131015|pmid=22738052|doi=10.2460/ajvr.73.7.1002}}</ref> At the same time, these studies still show similar results that prove their{{clarify|date=December 2017}} effects of controlling fatty acid metabolism for weight control, to avoid the need for weight loss diets.\n\n===Grain-free diet===\nGrain free cat food substitutes the typical carbohydrate sources like wheat, corn or rice with alternative sources such as white potato, peas, sweet potato or tapioca. \n\nA study published in the Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery in 2018 compared the carbohydrate content between grain-free diets and diets containing grains. According to this study the proportion of cat food purchased that is grain free has increased from 4% to 9% between 2012\u20132014. <ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Prantil|first=Lori R.|last2=Heinze|first2=Cailin R.|last3=Freeman|first3=Lisa M.|date=2017-06-01|title=Comparison of carbohydrate content between grain-containing and grain-free dry cat diets and between reported and calculated carbohydrate values|journal=Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery|volume=20|issue=4|pages=349\u2013355|language=en|doi=10.1177/1098612X17710842|pmid=28569080}}</ref> The researchers at Tufts University analyzed the nutritional information and contents of 77 different dry cat food diets. 42 of these diets contained grain, while 35 were labeled as grain free. The major ingredients and amounts were determined for each diet and then analyses were conducted comparing the two groups. It was found that the grain free diets had a lower mean carbohydrate content than the diets containing grain; however, there was a very wide range and lots of overlap between the two groups in both their carbohydrate contents. Sone grain free diets even had a higher amount of carbohydrates than the diets containing grain. Calorie amounts were similar for both diets. <ref name=\":7\" />\n\nA recent study published by the FDA has potentially linked grain free diets to [[dilated cardiomyopathy]] in both dogs and cats.

Plant sources do not contain enough of these. Vegetarian pet food companies try to correct these deficiencies by adding synthetically produced nutrients.<ref name=\"VT\"/>\n\nCats on a vegan diet can develop abnormally [[alkaline]] (high [[pH]]) urine as plant-based proteins are more alkaline than the meat-based foods which cats have evolved to eat. When the urine becomes too alkaline, there is an increased risk of formation of [[struvite]] (also known as magnesium ammonium phosphate) bladder crystals and/or stones. Calcium oxalate stones can also occur if the urine is too acidic. Such stones can create irritation and infection of the urinary tract and require veterinary treatment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.veganhealth.org/articles/vegan_cats |title=Vegan Cats |publisher=Veganhealth.org |accessdate=2014-08-10}}</ref>\n\nOrganizations that advocate vegan or vegetarian diets for people have split opinions regarding vegetarian or vegan cat food.

Biosynthesis of niacin occurs by metabolism of tryptophan via the kynurenine pathway to quinolinic acid, the niacin precursor. However, cats have a high activity of picolinic acid carboxylase, which converts one of the intermediates to picolinic acid instead of quinolinic acid. As a result, niacin can become deficient and require supplementation.\n\n===Arginine===\n{{see|urea cycle}}\nCats are unusually dependent on a constant supply of the amino acid arginine, and a diet lacking arginine causes marked weight loss and can be rapidly fatal. Arginine is an essential additive in cat food because cats have low levels of the enzymes which are responsible for the synthesis of [[ornithine]] and [[citrulline]] in the small intestine (specifically, for [[pyrroline-5-carboxylate]] production).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rogers | first1 = QR | last2 = Phang | first2 = JM | year = 1985 | title = Deficiency of pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase in the intestinal mucosa of the cat | url = | journal = J Nutr | volume = 115 | issue = 1| pages = 146\u201350 | doi = 10.1093/jn/115.1.146 }}</ref> Citrulline would typically go on to the kidneys to make arginine, but because cats have a deficiency in the enzymes that make it, citrulline is not produced in adequate quantities to make arginine. Arginine is essential in the urea cycle in order to convert the toxic component ammonia into urea that can then be excreted in the urine. Because of its essential role, deficiency in arginine results in a buildup of toxic ammonia and leads to [[hyperammonemia]]. The symptoms of hyperammonemia include lethargy, vomiting, ataxia, and hyperesthesia, and can be serious enough to induce death and coma in a matter of days if a cat is being fed an arginine-free diet. The quick onset of these symptoms is due to the fact that diets devoid in arginine will typically still contain all of the other amino acids, which will continue to be catabolized by the body, producing mass amounts of ammonia that very quickly build up with no way of being excreted.\n\n=== Zinc ===\nZinc's connection to skin and coat health is due to its influence on regulating cellular

many different categories.<ref name=\"book2\" /> Fatty acids can become attached to different molecules like carbohydrates or proteins and can elicit a wide range of functions in the body.<ref name=\"book2\" /> Some of those functions include: providing long-term energy storage, insulation (prevents heat loss, protects vital organs, helps transmit nerve impulses faster), structure, transportation around the body for nutrients and other biological molecules, and can also be precursors to other compounds in the body such as hormones (some of which are important for

The main complaint is excessive scratching ([[pruritus]]) which is usually resistant to treatment by [[Glucocorticoid|steroidal]] [[anti-inflammatory]] [[medication|drugs]]. The exact prevalence of food allergy in cats remains unknown. In 20 to 30% of the cases, cats have concurrent allergic diseases ([[atopy]]/flea-allergic [[dermatitis]]). A reliable diagnosis can only be made with [[Elimination diet|dietary elimination-challenge trials]]. [[Food allergy|Allergy]] [[Allergy testing|testing]] is necessary for the identification of the causative food component(s). Therapy consists of avoiding the offending food component(s).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Verlinden A, Hesta M, Millet S, Janssens GP |title=Food allergy in dogs and cats: a review |journal=Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr |volume=46 |issue=3 |pages=259\u201373 |year=2006 |pmid=16527756 |doi=10.1080/10408390591001117 }}</ref>\n\n== Malnutrition ==\nMalnutrition can be a problem for cats fed non-conventional diets. Cats fed exclusively on raw, [[freshwater fish]] can develop a [[thiamine]] deficiency. Those fed exclusively on liver may develop [[vitamin A]] toxicity. Also, exclusively meat-based diets may contain excessive [[protein]] and [[phosphorus]] whilst being deficient in [[calcium]], [[vitamin E]], and [[microminerals]] such as [[copper]], [[zinc]], and [[potassium]]. [[Energy density]] must also be maintained relative to the other [[nutrients]].

Overall, several major companies recalled more than 100 brands of pet foods with most of the recalled product coming from Menu Foods. The most likely cause according to the FDA is the presence of [[melamine]] in the wheat gluten of the affected foods. Melamine is known to falsely inflate the protein content rating of substances in laboratory tests. The economic impact on the pet food market has been extensive, with Menu Foods alone losing roughly $30 million from the recall. Some companies were not affected and utilized the situation to generate sales for alternative pet foods.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.newsweek.com/capitalizing-pet-food-panic-101439|title = CAPITALIZING ON PET-FOOD PANIC|date = 2007-05-07|access-date = |website = }}</ref>\n\n=== Bisphenol A ===\nA 2004 study reported that food packaged in cans coated with [[bisphenol A]] is correlated with the development of [[hyperthyroidism]] in cats.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Edinboro|first=Charlotte H.|author2=Scott-Moncrieff, Catharine|author3=Janovitz, Evan|author4=Thacker, Leon|author5=Glickman, Larry T.|date=March 2004|title=Epidemiologic study of relationships between consumption of commercial canned food and risk of hyperthyroidism in cats|journal=[[Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association]]|volume=224|issue=6|pages=879\u201386|doi=10.2460/javma.2004.224.879|pmid=15070058|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5b566d8fdb56f18898f109058a7b625762764878}}</ref>\n\n==Environmental impact==\n{{further|Overfishing}}\n{{See also|Environmental effects of meat production}}\nIn a study on the impacts of the pet food industry on world fish and seafood supplies, researchers estimate that 2.48 million metric tonnes of fish are used by the cat food industry each year.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=De Silva SS, Turchini GM |title=Towards Understanding the Impacts of the Pet Food Industry on World Fish and Seafood Supplies |journal=Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=459\u201367 |date=October 2008 |doi=10.1007/s10806-008-9109-6  }}</ref><ref>[http://www.petfoodindustry.com/ViewNews.aspx?id=22588 Cats taking a bite out of world fish supply] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114120956/http://www.petfoodindustry.com/ViewNews.aspx?id=22588 |date=2009-01-14 }} Petfood Industry News</ref> It was suggested that there needs to be \"a more objective and pragmatic approach to the use of a limited and decreasing biological resource, for human benefit.\" [[Marine conservation]] activist [[Paul Watson]] argues that the reduction in [[forage fish]] such as those commonly used in cat food (sardines, herring, anchovy etc.) negatively affects fish higher up the food chain like cod, tuna and swordfish, not to mention marine mammals and birds.<ref>[http://www.seashepherd.org/news-and-media/editorial-080828-1.html Aqua Cats Are Eating the Oceans] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223225656/http://www.seashepherd.org/news-and-media/editorial-080828-1.html |date=2009-02-23 }} Paul Watson, Sea Shepherd Conservation Society</ref>\n\nBased on 2004 numbers, cats in the US consume the caloric equivalent of what 192,000 ([[Demographics of the United States#Vital statistics|0.0655187%]]) Americans consume.

It was based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of prior album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" received positive reception, called \"impossibly catchy\" and \"classic pop\". It became Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States and stayed atop the chart for three weeks. It was Jackson's twenty-first single to be certified, which ranked her as the second female artist with the most certified singles. The single fared well internationally, reaching number five in the United Kingdom, and peaking within the top-ten in Italy and Denmark. It attained a silver certification in the United Kingdom, and allowed Jam and Lewis to receive a [[Grammy]] nomination for [[Producer of the Year]]. The song was later included in two of Jackson's greatest hits collections, ''[[Number Ones (Janet Jackson album)|Number Ones]]'' and ''[[Icon: Number Ones]]''.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. In addition to clips from the movie, it features advanced technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a levitating platform. The video had a reported cost of over $2.5 million, being one of the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos]] of all time. Its accolades include \"Outstanding Music Video\" and \"Most Stylish Music Video\" at the [[VH1]] Fashion Awards. The song was performed on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and the [[2000 MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Music Awards]], the latter regarded as one of the leading performances of Jackson's career.\n\nA slightly modified version of the song appeared on Jackson's seventh [[album]] ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" was considered to influence music videos from [[Britney Spears]], [[Jessica Simpson]] and [[Cassie (singer)|Cassie]]. The video was the first by director Joseph Kahn to feature Japanese themes and imagery, which he later used frequently following its popularity. Actress [[Jenna Dewan]] made one of her debut appearances in the video, crediting Jackson for the experience and platform to star in the dance film ''[[Step Up (film)|Step Up]]''. [[Rihanna]]'s \"Watch n' Learn\" was likened to the song, and it was also covered by Japanese singer [[Hitomi Shimatani]] as \"Papillon\".\n\n==Background==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" was written and produced by [[Janet Jackson]] and [[Jam & Lewis]] as the theme for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', starring Jackson and actor [[Eddie Murphy]]. She portrays Professor Denise Gaines in the film, the love interest of Sherman Klump, one of many characters portrayed by Murphy.<ref name=\"KlumpsMTV\"/>\n\nJackson stated that \"it really tells you about the movie and how it doesn't matter what is on the exterior, but the interior. His heart, his soul, that really matters to me.

Jam recalled, \"He said, 'Now that you've seen the film, if you'd like to do a song for it, that'd be great.'\" Segal told Jackson that she was an exceptional actress after becoming convinced she truly loved Murphy's character, leading Jackson to suggest writing an up-tempo love song rather than a ballad.<ref name=\"Bronson\" />\n\nThe song was based on a poem Jackson had written, discarded, then rediscovered.<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/jun/03/janet-jackson-10-of-the-best|title=Janet Jackson: 10 of the best|last=Cragg|first=Michael|website=[[The Guardian]]|date=June 3, 2015|access-date=February 7, 2020}}</ref> Jackson's original lyrics were kept intact, although its structure was altered. Jam stated that \"the lyrical idea for 'Doesn't Really Matter' is totally hers, but the music and melody was something I had done with one of our drum programmers, Alex Richburg. I thought of it as a slow melody, but we sped it up.\" Jackson wrote the remaining lyrics overnight. \"We ended up with two different choruses,\" said Jam. \"I wrote, 'Nutty, nutty, nutty, my love for you.' and she wrote 'Doesn't really matter.'\" \"The 'Doesn't really matter' chorus was better but she liked 'Nutty, nutty, nutty' and said we should put it at the end of the song.\"<ref name=\"Bronson\" /> Jackson presented three songs including \"Doesn't Really Matter\" and an early version of \"Feels So Right\", later included on Jackson's following album. Segal decided that \"Doesn't Really Matter\" was a better fit and a \"summertime record.\" A slightly modified version was included on ''All for You'', featuring an alternate introduction and elements from the song's remix by [[Rockwilder]].<ref name=\"Bronson\" />\n\n==Composition==\nIn \"Doesn't Really Matter\", Jackson speaks of looking past physical appearance, choosing to love the person inside. Using a vocal [[falsetto]], Jackson assures \"[It] doesn't really matter what the eye is seeing, 'cause I'm in love with the inner being,\" considered a \"sweet song of unconditional love.\" Its theme also emphasizes self-acceptance and pride, opposing negativity. Jackson said \"It plays a major part in society, it seems today. Their image, what a woman is supposed to look like \u2013 all the things you read in the magazines about either being too thin or too this or too that, but it's really about feeling good yourself and accepting yourself. Self-acceptance, which is another story you see here in this film, is the most important thing as well as being happy with who you are.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.femail.com.au/jacksonii.htm |title=Janet Jackson \u2013 Nutty Professor II Interview |work=Femail.com.au |accessdate=February 2, 2001}}</ref>\n\nThe song is based on Jackson's character Denise's \"unconditional love\" for the obese but gentle Sherman. Jackson said, \"I loved this character so much because she didn't care about all the other things that people may have seen or saw and thought was wrong with Sherman. Those were the things she loved about him, and then on top of that she saw beyond that \u2013 how genuine of a man he is, how kind he is, a very good-hearted person and that's what she loves about him[...] he's someone I could fall in love with because it's about what's inside.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Mrs. Klump, If You're Nasty |work=[[Yahoo!

It was based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of prior album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" received positive reception, called \"impossibly catchy\" and \"classic pop\". It became Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States and stayed atop the chart for three weeks. It was Jackson's twenty-first single to be certified, which ranked her as the second female artist with the most certified singles. The single fared well internationally, reaching number five in the United Kingdom, and peaking within the top-ten in Italy and Denmark. It attained a silver certification in the United Kingdom, and allowed Jam and Lewis to receive a [[Grammy]] nomination for [[Producer of the Year]]. The song was later included in two of Jackson's greatest hits collections, ''[[Number Ones (Janet Jackson album)|Number Ones]]'' and ''[[Icon: Number Ones]]''.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. In addition to clips from the movie, it features advanced technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a levitating platform. The video had a reported cost of over $2.5 million, being one of the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos]] of all time. Its accolades include \"Outstanding Music Video\" and \"Most Stylish Music Video\" at the [[VH1]] Fashion Awards. The song was performed on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and the [[2000 MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Music Awards]], the latter regarded as one of the leading performances of Jackson's career.\n\nA slightly modified version of the song appeared on Jackson's seventh [[album]] ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" was considered to influence music videos from [[Britney Spears]], [[Jessica Simpson]] and [[Cassie (singer)|Cassie]]. The video was the first by director Joseph Kahn to feature Japanese themes and imagery, which he later used frequently following its popularity. Actress [[Jenna Dewan]] made one of her debut appearances in the video, crediting Jackson for the experience and platform to star in the dance film ''[[Step Up (film)|Step Up]]''. [[Rihanna]]'s \"Watch n' Learn\" was likened to the song, and it was also covered by Japanese singer [[Hitomi Shimatani]] as \"Papillon\".\n\n==Background==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" was written and produced by [[Janet Jackson]] and [[Jam & Lewis]] as the theme for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', starring Jackson and actor [[Eddie Murphy]]. She portrays Professor Denise Gaines in the film, the love interest of Sherman Klump, one of many characters portrayed by Murphy.<ref name=\"KlumpsMTV\"/>\n\nJackson stated that \"it really tells you about the movie and how it doesn't matter what is on the exterior, but the interior. His heart, his soul, that really matters to me. That's what I'm in love with, that's what matters to me the most, and it doesn't matter what other people say.\"<ref name=\"Making\" /> An [[Audio mastering|unmastered]] version [[internet leak|leaked]] and received airplay ahead of its scheduled release, followed by a positive response from critics and fans.

Jam recalled, \"He said, 'Now that you've seen the film, if you'd like to do a song for it, that'd be great.'\" Segal told Jackson that she was an exceptional actress after becoming convinced she truly loved Murphy's character, leading Jackson to suggest writing an up-tempo love song rather than a ballad.<ref name=\"Bronson\" />\n\nThe song was based on a poem Jackson had written, discarded, then rediscovered.<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/jun/03/janet-jackson-10-of-the-best|title=Janet Jackson: 10 of the best|last=Cragg|first=Michael|website=[[The Guardian]]|date=June 3, 2015|access-date=February 7, 2020}}</ref> Jackson's original lyrics were kept intact, although its structure was altered. Jam stated that \"the lyrical idea for 'Doesn't Really Matter' is totally hers, but the music and melody was something I had done with one of our drum programmers, Alex Richburg. I thought of it as a slow melody, but we sped it up.\" Jackson wrote the remaining lyrics overnight. \"We ended up with two different choruses,\" said Jam. \"I wrote, 'Nutty, nutty, nutty, my love for you.' and she wrote 'Doesn't really matter.'\" \"The 'Doesn't really matter' chorus was better but she liked 'Nutty, nutty, nutty' and said we should put it at the end of the song.\"<ref name=\"Bronson\" /> Jackson presented three songs including \"Doesn't Really Matter\" and an early version of \"Feels So Right\", later included on Jackson's following album. Segal decided that \"Doesn't Really Matter\" was a better fit and a \"summertime record.\" A slightly modified version was included on ''All for You'', featuring an alternate introduction and elements from the song's remix by [[Rockwilder]].<ref name=\"Bronson\" />\n\n==Composition==\nIn \"Doesn't Really Matter\", Jackson speaks of looking past physical appearance, choosing to love the person inside. Using a vocal [[falsetto]], Jackson assures \"[It] doesn't really matter what the eye is seeing, 'cause I'm in love with the inner being,\" considered a \"sweet song of unconditional love.\" Its theme also emphasizes self-acceptance and pride, opposing negativity. Jackson said \"It plays a major part in society, it seems today. Their image, what a woman is supposed to look like \u2013 all the things you read in the magazines about either being too thin or too this or too that, but it's really about feeling good yourself and accepting yourself. Self-acceptance, which is another story you see here in this film, is the most important thing as well as being happy with who you are.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.femail.com.au/jacksonii.htm |title=Janet Jackson \u2013 Nutty Professor II Interview |work=Femail.com.au |accessdate=February 2, 2001}}</ref>\n\nThe song is based on Jackson's character Denise's \"unconditional love\" for the obese but gentle Sherman. Jackson said, \"I loved this character so much because she didn't care about all the other things that people may have seen or saw and thought was wrong with Sherman. Those were the things she loved about him, and then on top of that she saw beyond that \u2013 how genuine of a man he is, how kind he is, a very good-hearted person and that's what she loves about him[...] he's someone I could fall in love with because it's about what's inside.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Mrs. Klump, If You're Nasty |work=[[Yahoo!

When he was 15,<ref>{{cite book|author=Assayas, Michka (ed.)|title = Le dictionnaire du rock|year= 2000|publisher= Robert laffont, collection Bouquins|page=775}}</ref> Jeff Healey formed the band Blue Direction, a four-piece that primarily played bar-band cover tunes and featured bassist Jeremy Littler, drummer Graydon Chapman, and a schoolmate, Rob Quail on second guitar. This band played various local clubs in Toronto, including the [[Colonial Tavern]].\n\nHealey began hosting a jazz and blues show on radio station [[CIUT-FM]] where he became known for playing from his massive collection of vintage 78 rpm [[phonograph|gramophone]] records.<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.cbc.ca/radio2/blog/2008/03/03/jeff_healey_1.html | title=Jeff Healey | website=Cbc.ca | accessdate=May 23, 2011}}</ref>\n\nShortly thereafter he was introduced to two musicians, bassist Joe Rockman and drummer Tom Stephen, with whom he formed a trio, The Jeff Healey Band. This band made their first public appearance at the Birds Nest, located upstairs at Chicago's Diner on [[Queen Street West]] in Toronto. They received a write-up in Toronto's ''[[Now (newspaper)|NOW]]'' magazine, and soon were playing almost nightly in local clubs, such as Grossman's Tavern and the famed blues club Albert's Hall (where Jeff Healey was discovered by guitarists [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] and [[Albert Collins]]).\n\nAfter being signed to [[Arista Records]] in 1988, the band released the album ''[[See the Light (Jeff Healey album)|See the Light]]'', which appeared on the RPM Top 100 chart in 1989.<ref>[http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/rpm/Pages/item.aspx?IdNumber=4952& \"RPM Top 100 Albums\"].

While the band was recording ''See the Light'', they were also filming (and recording for the soundtrack of) the [[Patrick Swayze]] film [[Road House (1989 film)|''Road House'']]. Healey had numerous acting scenes in the movie with Swayze, as his band was the house cover band for the bar featured in the movie. In 1990, the band won the [[Juno Award]] for [[Juno Award for Entertainer of the Year|Canadian Entertainer of the Year]]. The albums ''[[Hell to Pay (Jeff Healey album)|Hell to Pay]]'' and ''[[Feel This (album)|Feel This]]'' gave Healey 10 charting singles in Canada between 1990 and 1994, including a [[cover version|cover]] of [[The Beatles]]' \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\" which featured [[George Harrison]] and [[Jeff Lynne]] on backing vocals and acoustic guitar.<ref>Arista Records LP AL-8632, 1990.</ref>\n\n==Later work and life==\n[[File:JeffHealeyAug312002.jpg|thumb|left|Healey performing on August 31, 2002]]\nBy the release of the 2000 album ''[[Get Me Some (album)|Get Me Some]],'' Healey began to concentrate his talent in a different musical direction closer to his heart, the appreciation for another original American music form, [[jazz]].\n\nHe went on to release three CDs of music of traditional American jazz from the 1920s and 1930s. He had been sitting in with these types of bands around Toronto since the beginning of his music career. Though known primarily as a guitarist, Healey also played trumpet during live performances.  His main jazz group for touring and recording being Jeff Healey's Jazz Wizards.\n\nHealey was an avid [[record collecting|record collector]] and amassed a collection of well over 30,000 [[78 rpm]] records. Starting in 1990 he hosted a radio program of very early jazz on CIUT at the University of Toronto with Colin Bray. Later he went national on CBC Radio's program entitled ''My Kind of Jazz'', in which he played records from his vast vintage jazz collection. He moved the show two years later to Jazz FM - CJRT; as a part of ongoing celebrations for what would have been Healey's 50th birthday in 2016, the latter program began to air in repeats Wednesdays 9pm on jazz.fm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jeffhealey.com/2016/01/the-50th-celebrations-start-now|title=The 50th Celebrations Start Now!|first=|last=Rog|date=January 20, 2016|website=Jeffhealey.com|accessdate=March 10, 2019}}</ref>\n \nFor many years, Healey toured throughout North America and Europe and performed at his club, \"Healey's\" on [[Bathurst Street, Toronto|Bathurst Street]] in Toronto, where he played with his blues band on Thursday nights and also with his jazz group on Saturday afternoons. The club moved to a bigger location at 56 Blue Jays Way and was rechristened \"Jeff Healey's Roadhouse.\" Though he had lent his name to the club and often played there, Jeff Healey did not own or manage the bar. (The name came from the 1989 film, ''[[Road House (1989 film)|Road House]],'' in which Healey appeared.)\nAt the time of his death, he had been planning to perform a series of shows in the United Kingdom, Germany, and the [[Netherlands]] with his other band, the \"[[Jeff Healey Blues Band]]\" (aka the \"Healey's House Band\") in April 2008.\n\nOver the years, Healey toured and sat in with many well-known performers, including [[The Allman Brothers]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], [[Buddy Guy]], [[BB King]], [[ZZ Top]], [[Steve Lukather]], [[Eric Clapton]] and many more. In 2006, Healey appeared on [[Deep Purple]] vocalist [[Ian Gillan]]'s CD/DVD ''[[Gillan's Inn (album)|Gillan's Inn]].''\n\nHealey discovered and helped develop the careers of other musical artists, including [[Terra Hazelton]] and [[Amanda Marshall]].<ref>[http://pages.infinit.net/sonicboy/amanda/ The Ultimate Amanda Marshall Homepage].

They received a write-up in Toronto's ''[[Now (newspaper)|NOW]]'' magazine, and soon were playing almost nightly in local clubs, such as Grossman's Tavern and the famed blues club Albert's Hall (where Jeff Healey was discovered by guitarists [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] and [[Albert Collins]]).\n\nAfter being signed to [[Arista Records]] in 1988, the band released the album ''[[See the Light (Jeff Healey album)|See the Light]]'', which appeared on the RPM Top 100 chart in 1989.<ref>[http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/rpm/Pages/item.aspx?IdNumber=4952& \"RPM Top 100 Albums\"]. ''RPM Magazine'' Volume 50, No. 24 October 14, 1989.</ref> It featuring the hit single \"[[Angel Eyes (The Jeff Healey Band song)|Angel Eyes]]\" and the song \"Hideaway\", which was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. While the band was recording ''See the Light'', they were also filming (and recording for the soundtrack of) the [[Patrick Swayze]] film [[Road House (1989 film)|''Road House'']]. Healey had numerous acting scenes in the movie with Swayze, as his band was the house cover band for the bar featured in the movie. In 1990, the band won the [[Juno Award]] for [[Juno Award for Entertainer of the Year|Canadian Entertainer of the Year]]. The albums ''[[Hell to Pay (Jeff Healey album)|Hell to Pay]]'' and ''[[Feel This (album)|Feel This]]'' gave Healey 10 charting singles in Canada between 1990 and 1994, including a [[cover version|cover]] of [[The Beatles]]' \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\" which featured [[George Harrison]] and [[Jeff Lynne]] on backing vocals and acoustic guitar.<ref>Arista Records LP AL-8632, 1990.</ref>\n\n==Later work and life==\n[[File:JeffHealeyAug312002.jpg|thumb|left|Healey performing on August 31, 2002]]\nBy the release of the 2000 album ''[[Get Me Some (album)|Get Me Some]],'' Healey began to concentrate his talent in a different musical direction closer to his heart, the appreciation for another original American music form, [[jazz]].\n\nHe went on to release three CDs of music of traditional American jazz from the 1920s and 1930s. He had been sitting in with these types of bands around Toronto since the beginning of his music career. Though known primarily as a guitarist, Healey also played trumpet during live performances.  His main jazz group for touring and recording being Jeff Healey's Jazz Wizards.\n\nHealey was an avid [[record collecting|record collector]] and amassed a collection of well over 30,000 [[78 rpm]] records. Starting in 1990 he hosted a radio program of very early jazz on CIUT at the University of Toronto with Colin Bray. Later he went national on CBC Radio's program entitled ''My Kind of Jazz'', in which he played records from his vast vintage jazz collection. He moved the show two years later to Jazz FM - CJRT; as a part of ongoing celebrations for what would have been Healey's 50th birthday in 2016, the latter program began to air in repeats Wednesdays 9pm on jazz.fm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jeffhealey.com/2016/01/the-50th-celebrations-start-now|title=The 50th Celebrations Start Now!|first=|last=Rog|date=January 20, 2016|website=Jeffhealey.com|accessdate=March 10, 2019}}</ref>\n \nFor many years, Healey toured throughout North America and Europe and performed at his club, \"Healey's\" on [[Bathurst Street, Toronto|Bathurst Street]] in Toronto, where he played with his blues band on Thursday nights and also with his jazz group on Saturday afternoons. The club moved to a bigger location at 56 Blue Jays Way and was rechristened \"Jeff Healey's Roadhouse.\" Though he had lent his name to the club and often played there, Jeff Healey did not own or manage the bar. (The name came from the 1989 film, ''[[Road House (1989 film)|Road House]],'' in which Healey appeared.)\nAt the time of his death, he had been planning to perform a series of shows in the United Kingdom, Germany, and the [[Netherlands]] with his other band, the \"[[Jeff Healey Blues Band]]\" (aka the \"Healey's House Band\") in April 2008.\n\nOver the years, Healey toured and sat in with many well-known performers, including [[The Allman Brothers]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], [[Buddy Guy]], [[BB King]], [[ZZ Top]], [[Steve Lukather]], [[Eric Clapton]] and many more. In 2006, Healey appeared on [[Deep Purple]] vocalist [[Ian Gillan]]'s CD/DVD ''[[Gillan's Inn (album)|Gillan's Inn]].''\n\nHealey discovered and helped develop the careers of other musical artists, including [[Terra Hazelton]] and [[Amanda Marshall]].<ref>[http://pages.infinit.net/sonicboy/amanda/ The Ultimate Amanda Marshall Homepage].

The population was 17,578 at the 2010 census. It is part of the [[North Penn School District]] and the [[North Penn Valley]] region that is centered around the borough of [[Lansdale, Pennsylvania|Lansdale]]. Towamencin has residential neighborhoods, historic farmhouses, recreational facilities, many schools, and open spaces.  The community is a mix of residential, commercial and rural development. The Township is centrally located in the middle of [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery County]] with easy access to the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]]\u2019s [[Interstate 476|Northeast Extension]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Founding===\nThe first settlers, of German, Welsh, and Dutch descent, arrived in Towamencin Township around the turn of the 18th century. They mainly pursued agricultural endeavors to sustain their livelihood.\n\nThe first grant of land in Towamencin Township was in 1703 from [[William Penn]]'s Commissioners to Benjamin Furley on June 8. The Commissioners granted 1,000 acres (4&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) to him. On June 17 of that same year, Abraham Tennis and Jan Lucken bought the property from him, and then divided the land in half in 1709. The [[Edward Morgan Log House]] stands on land that was part of 600 acres (2.4&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) granted to Griffith Jones by the Commissioners. Edward Morgan purchased 309 acres (1.25&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of this land, which included an existing \"dwelling house\", from Griffith Jones on February 26, 1708. In 1720, his daughter Sarah, who in 1734 would give birth to the famous frontiersman [[Daniel Boone]], married Squire Boone.<ref name=morganhouse>{{cite book\n|title=Edward Morgan House, 1973, Nomination Document\n|publisher=National Park Service, National Register of Historic Places|location=Washington, D.C}}</ref>\nThe land containing the house was then deeded to John Morgan, son of Edward, on August 23, 1723 as part of a 104-acre (.42&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) tract.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.morganloghouse.org/history.php | title=History of the Morgan Log House | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001215505/http://www.morganloghouse.org/history.php | archivedate=2011-10-01 }}</ref> In March 1728 the settlers of the area petitioned [[William Penn]]'s Commissioners for Towamencin to become a Township. The request was granted and a charter given. The land was surveyed and recorded, outlining the boundaries of the Township, known as antioch. Those boundaries are similar to what they are today. In the enumeration of 1734 there were 32 landholders within the Township, with William Tennis having the most area at 250 acres (1&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>).\n\n===The Indians of Towamencin===\n\nThe American Indians who inhabited the area were the [[Lenni Lenape]]. They lived in [[Pennsylvania]], as well as [[Delaware]], [[New Jersey]], and parts of [[Maryland]]. They were divided into three tribes: the Turtle, Turkeys, and Wolf, which were subdivided into clans, each clan having a name representing the character and situation of the tribe as a whole.\n\nThe Indians of Towamencin Township are of the [[Delaware Nation]]. They had a settlement in the southwest section of the Township along the Towamencin Creek. They established friendly relations with the settlers when they came to the Township. There are some accounts of violence attributed to the Indians, but they cannot be proven and are probably fictional.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} There are many accounts of Indians helping to tend the sick, and trading food and goods with the settlers.\n\nIt is not recorded when the tribes of Indians left Towamencin; it is suspected they left after the [[American Revolution|Revolutionary War]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nThe Maltese Cross of the Towamencin Volunteer Fire Company has an American Indian in the center.\n\n===American Revolutionary War===\nPennsylvania is known as the Keystone State for its role in the [[American Revolution|Revolution]], and as one of the oldest settlements during the time, Towamencin Township played a part: the Township had encampments of soldiers, had many citizens that served, and was the retreating place for [[George Washington|General Washington]] and his troops after the [[Battle of Germantown]].\n\nThe [[Continental Army]] troops were in Towamencin from [[List of American Revolutionary War battles|October 8, 1777 to October 16, 1777]] and camped in the Northern section of the Township. The Township provided a secure area to rest, without fear of surprise attack by the [[British Empire|British]].<ref name=Specht>{{cite book\n  | last =Specht\n  | first =J.

The house was located on Wambold Road.\n\n[[Francis Nash|General Francis Nash]] was wounded at the [[Battle of Germantown]] and was carried from [[Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Germantown]] to Towamencin. He was cared for in a house, according to Washington's writings, located \"a mile-and-a-quarter south of the Great North Wales Turnpike,\" now Sumneytown Pike,<ref name=Specht /><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.emu.edu/seminary/features/franconia| title=Eastern Mennonite Seminary}}</ref> along with other wounded men of the [[Battle of Germantown]]. He died two days later and is buried at the present-day Towamencin Mennonite Church cemetery, known then as the Towamencin Mennonite Meetinghouse.\n\nIt was reported that Henry Cassel, whose land was used as an encampment by the Colonists, submitted to the [[Continental Congress]] an estimate of damages to his property by [[Continental Army|Washington's Army]]. The damage was to 696 fence rails used for firewood. The cost to replace those rails was 8.14 [[Pound sterling|pounds]]. It is not known whether the newly formed government paid.<ref name=Specht />\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the township has a total area of 9.7&nbsp;square miles (25.1&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), all of it land. It is drained via the [[Skippack Creek]] into the [[Perkiomen Creek]] and [[Schuylkill River]]. Its villages include Inglewood, [[Kulpsville, Pennsylvania|Kulpsville]], and Oak Park (also in Hatfield Township.)\n\nThe Lansdale Interchange to [[Interstate 476]] is with Sumneytown Pike ([[Pennsylvania Route 63|Route 63]]) in Kulpsville. Other roads of note include Allentown Road, Bustard Road/Forty Foot Road, Morris Road, Valley Forge Road ([[Pennsylvania Route 363|Route 363]],) Wambold Road, and Welsh Road. 63 follows Forty Foot Road and Welsh Road east into Lansdale. The township boundaries consists entirely of straight sides at right angles and most of its boundaries consist of roads.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1800= 413\n|1820= 571\n|1850= 904\n|1860= 1137\n|1870= 1209\n|1880= 1232\n|1890= 1140\n|1900= 1005\n|1910= 1160\n|1920= 1166\n|1930= 1275\n|1940= 1412\n|1950= 1604\n|1960= 3724\n|1970= 4738\n|1980= 11112\n|1990= 14167\n|2000= 17597\n|2010= 17578\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=18491\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=March 1, 2020}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=April 4, 2019}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the 2010 census, the township was 85.1% White, 4.1% Black or African American, 0.1% Native American, 8.4% Asian, and 1.6% were two or more races. 2.5% of the population were of Hispanic or Latino ancestry.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/census/profile/PA|title=Census 2010: Pennsylvania - USATODAY.com|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212221153/http://factfinder.census.gov/main.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2020-02-12|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=American FactFinder}}</ref> of 2000, 17,597 people, 6,872 households, and 4,810 families resided in the township.

In early 2007 the Board authorized the formation of a [[Strategic Planning]] Committee.\n\nA committee of five residents, two supervisors, and the Township Manager was formed in late February, charged with developing a Five-Year Strategic Plan and a goal of completing it in time for the 2008 budget process.  The committee expanded to six residents in mid-May.\n\nThe committee began weekly meetings in March 2007, starting with the task of developing a Community [[Strategic Planning#Mission statements and vision statements|Vision and Mission]] Statement.  They then received planning inputs from all Department Heads and the Township Manager. At the end of the input process, the committee developed [[Towamencin Township, Pennsylvania#Committee Priorities|Priorities]], which were then voted on by each member of the committee for prioritization.\n\nThe committee then developed [[Strategic Planning#Goals.2C objectives and targets|Goals, Sustainability Objectives]] and Implementation Tools and Techniques for each of the [[Towamencin Township, Pennsylvania#Committee Priorities|Priorities]], segmenting them by areas of the Township Budget.\n\nThe Strategic Plan was then briefed to the Board of Supervisors 22 August 2007 by Mr. Fred Seipt, who represented the entire committee.  The plan was accepted and approved by the Board of Supervisors 26 September 2007.  The Strategic Plan has been updated every year since.<ref name=splan>{{cite book \n  | author = Bob Fritz, Beth Hegedus, Bob Klein, Juan Lacomba, David J. Mosesso, Fred Seipt, Daniel M.

The population was 17,578 at the 2010 census. It is part of the [[North Penn School District]] and the [[North Penn Valley]] region that is centered around the borough of [[Lansdale, Pennsylvania|Lansdale]]. Towamencin has residential neighborhoods, historic farmhouses, recreational facilities, many schools, and open spaces.  The community is a mix of residential, commercial and rural development. The Township is centrally located in the middle of [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery County]] with easy access to the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]]\u2019s [[Interstate 476|Northeast Extension]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Founding===\nThe first settlers, of German, Welsh, and Dutch descent, arrived in Towamencin Township around the turn of the 18th century. They mainly pursued agricultural endeavors to sustain their livelihood.\n\nThe first grant of land in Towamencin Township was in 1703 from [[William Penn]]'s Commissioners to Benjamin Furley on June 8. The Commissioners granted 1,000 acres (4&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) to him. On June 17 of that same year, Abraham Tennis and Jan Lucken bought the property from him, and then divided the land in half in 1709. The [[Edward Morgan Log House]] stands on land that was part of 600 acres (2.4&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) granted to Griffith Jones by the Commissioners. Edward Morgan purchased 309 acres (1.25&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of this land, which included an existing \"dwelling house\", from Griffith Jones on February 26, 1708. In 1720, his daughter Sarah, who in 1734 would give birth to the famous frontiersman [[Daniel Boone]], married Squire Boone.<ref name=morganhouse>{{cite book\n|title=Edward Morgan House, 1973, Nomination Document\n|publisher=National Park Service, National Register of Historic Places|location=Washington, D.C}}</ref>\nThe land containing the house was then deeded to John Morgan, son of Edward, on August 23, 1723 as part of a 104-acre (.42&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) tract.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.morganloghouse.org/history.php | title=History of the Morgan Log House | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001215505/http://www.morganloghouse.org/history.php | archivedate=2011-10-01 }}</ref> In March 1728 the settlers of the area petitioned [[William Penn]]'s Commissioners for Towamencin to become a Township. The request was granted and a charter given. The land was surveyed and recorded, outlining the boundaries of the Township, known as antioch. Those boundaries are similar to what they are today. In the enumeration of 1734 there were 32 landholders within the Township, with William Tennis having the most area at 250 acres (1&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>).\n\n===The Indians of Towamencin===\n\nThe American Indians who inhabited the area were the [[Lenni Lenape]]. They lived in [[Pennsylvania]], as well as [[Delaware]], [[New Jersey]], and parts of [[Maryland]].

The committee expanded to six residents in mid-May.\n\nThe committee began weekly meetings in March 2007, starting with the task of developing a Community [[Strategic Planning#Mission statements and vision statements|Vision and Mission]] Statement.  They then received planning inputs from all Department Heads and the Township Manager. At the end of the input process, the committee developed [[Towamencin Township, Pennsylvania#Committee Priorities|Priorities]], which were then voted on by each member of the committee for prioritization.\n\nThe committee then developed [[Strategic Planning#Goals.2C objectives and targets|Goals, Sustainability Objectives]] and Implementation Tools and Techniques for each of the [[Towamencin Township, Pennsylvania#Committee Priorities|Priorities]], segmenting them by areas of the Township Budget.\n\nThe Strategic Plan was then briefed to the Board of Supervisors 22 August 2007 by Mr. Fred Seipt, who represented the entire committee.

It has roughly 1.5 times the [[Sun]]'s mass and 4.9 times its luminosity. It is part of a system that also contains a [[debris disk]] and at least four [[gas giant|massive planets]]. Those planets, along with [[Fomalhaut b]], were the first [[exoplanet]]s whose orbital motion was confirmed by [[direct imaging]].  The star is a [[Gamma Doradus variable]]: its [[luminosity]] changes because of non-radial pulsations of its surface. The star is also classified as a [[Lambda Bo\u00f6tis star]], which means its surface layers are depleted in [[iron peak]] [[Chemical element|element]]s. It is the only known star which is simultaneously a Gamma Doradus variable, a [[Lambda Bo\u00f6tis star|Lambda Bo\u00f6tis]] type, and a [[Vega]]-like star (a star with [[infrared excess|excess infrared emission]] caused by a [[circumstellar disk]]).\n\n== Location==\nHR 8799 is a naked eye star, 5.96 magnitude, located inside the western edge of the [[great square of Pegasus]], between [[Beta Pegasi|Scheat]] and [[Alpha Pegasi|Markab]].

Because of this special status, stars like HR 8799 have a very complex spectral type. The luminosity profile of the [[Balmer lines]] in the star's spectrum, as well as the star's [[effective temperature]], best match the typical properties of an [[F-type main-sequence star|F0&nbsp;V star]]. However, the strength of the [[calcium]] II K [[absorption line]] and the other metallic lines are more like those of an [[A-type main-sequence star|A5&nbsp;V star]].

The first spectroscopic study of planet b (performed at near-infrared wavelengths) detected strong water absorption, which indicates a hydrogen-rich atmosphere. Weak methane and carbon monoxide absorption in this planet's atmosphere was also  detected, indicating efficient vertical mixing of the atmosphere and a disequilibrium {{chem2|CO}}/{{chem2|CH4}} ratio at the photosphere. Compared to models of planetary atmospheres, this first spectrum of planet b is best matched by a model of enhanced [[metallicity]] (about 10 times the metallicity of the Sun), which may support the notion that this planet formed through core-accretion.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Barman |first1=Travis S. |last2=Macintosh |first2=Bruce |date=2011 |title=Clouds and Chemistry in the Atmosphere of Extrasolar Planet HR8799b |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=733 |issue=65 |pages= 65|publisher=AAS |doi=10.1088/0004-637X/733/1/65 |arxiv=1103.3895 |bibcode=2011ApJ...733...65B}}</ref>\n\nThe first simultaneous spectra of all four known planets in the HR 8799 system were obtained in 2012 using the Project 1640 instrument at Palomar Observatory.

Though these spectra do not directly correspond to any known astrophysical objects, some of the planet spectra demonstrate similarities with L- and T-type brown dwarfs and the night-side spectrum of Saturn. The implications of the simultaneous spectra of all four planets obtained with Project 1640 are summarized as follows: Planet b contains ammonia and/or acetylene as well as carbon dioxide, but has little methane; Planet c contains ammonia, perhaps some acetylene but neither carbon dioxide nor substantial methane; Planet d contains acetylene, methane, and carbon dioxide but ammonia is not definitively detected; Planet e contains methane and acetylene but no ammonia or carbon dioxide.

Though these spectra do not directly correspond to any known astrophysical objects, some of the planet spectra demonstrate similarities with L- and T-type brown dwarfs and the night-side spectrum of Saturn. The implications of the simultaneous spectra of all four planets obtained with Project 1640 are summarized as follows: Planet b contains ammonia and/or acetylene as well as carbon dioxide, but has little methane; Planet c contains ammonia, perhaps some acetylene but neither carbon dioxide nor substantial methane; Planet d contains acetylene, methane, and carbon dioxide but ammonia is not definitively detected; Planet e contains methane and acetylene but no ammonia or carbon dioxide.
