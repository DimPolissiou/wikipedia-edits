The approximate duration is 40 minutes.\n\n== History ==\n=== The unfinished composition ===\nHill could begin composing the first movement of the symphony in his Leipzig years (between 1887 and 1891). Originally it had no program. The first three movements are prefaced with some poems by [[Thomas Bracken]] related to [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]], but they were not initially intended for this piece: Hill added them after the success of his cantata ''[[Hinemoa (cantata)|Hinemoa]]''.<ref name=\"Lam\" /> According to Allan Stiles, there are no real M\u0101ori musical elements in the symphony. The first two movements were prefaced with extracts from the poem ''The March of Rauparaha'', the third with part of the poem ''Waipounamutu''.<ref name=\"Lam\" /> These inscriptions led the symphony to bear the subtitle ''Maori'' in some sources.<ref name=\"McN\" />\n\nThe unfinished symphony may have been intended for a Wellington orchestra Hill conducted in 1892-1896. There are several reasons to think so: only two [[horn (instrument)|horn]]s are required as well as two hand-tuned [[timpani]] (rather than pedal tuned ones). There is a copyist's contrabass part of the first three movements at the [[State Library of New South Wales|Mitchell Library]], dated 1898, which gives the ''[[terminus ante quem]]'' for them.<ref name=\"McN\" />\n\nThe manuscripts of the first three movements are located at the [[National Library of Australia]] in [[Canberra]]. The draft score of the finale was nearly completed: it lacks only the timpani part and [[dynamics (music)]], some brass parts are incomplete. Allan Stiles proposes two reasons why this composition remained unfinished: the one being Hill's growing interest in theatrical music, the other being the unlikely prospect of a complete performance.<ref name=\"McN\" />\n\n=== Performance history and the final completion ===\nTwo of the three completed movements have been performed on several occasions, with different titles. The first (''Allegro con brio'') was performed in [[Melbourne]] in 1913 as ''Te Rauparaha Symphonic Poem''. The second (''Adagio'') was performed as ''[[Tangihanga|Tangi]]'' in [[Sydney]] (1899), then in [[Wellington]] (1907 and 1909) and in [[London]] ([[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]], 18 July<ref name=\"Pleskun2012\">{{cite book|author=Stephen Pleskun|title=A CHRONOLOGICAL HISTORY OF AUSTRALIAN COMPOSERS AND THEIR COMPOSITIONS: (VOLUME 1: 1901\u20131954)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JfVPAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT158|date=17 January 2012|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|isbn=978-1-4653-8226-9|page=158}}</ref> 1911).<ref name=\"Lam\" /> It is unknown whether the ''Scherzo'' has ever been performed, but it definitely originates from an early version of Hill's ''[[String Quartet No. 1 (Hill)|String Quartet No. 1]]'' written in Leipzig (this first scherzo was later substituted in the Quartet with another one and eventually made its way into ''[[String Quartet No. 4 (Hill)|String Quartet No. 4]]'').<ref name=\"Lam\" /><ref name=\"McN\">{{cite book|author=Rhoderick McNeill|title=The Australian Symphony from Federation to 1960|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T_nOCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA51|date=23 March 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-04087-3|pages=51\u201356}}</ref>\n\nThe symphony was edited by [[Richard Divall]] without any finale at all.
