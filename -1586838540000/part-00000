It was written and directed by [[Daniel Palladino]]. The plot follows Midge and her family's trip to a Jewish resort in the [[Catskill Mountains]] for the summer. Susie poses as an employee of the resort while booking gigs for Midge. Midge meets Benjamin ([[Zachary Levi]]), a bachelor physician who is also vacationing at the resort.\n\n\"We're Going to the Catskills!\" was released on December 5, 2018 on [[Amazon Prime]]. For the episode, the director was nominated for a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] and a [[Directors Guild of America Award]]. [[Tony Shalhoub]] received an Emmy in the Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series category. The episode also won three Primetime Emmy Creative Arts Awards from six total nominations.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> \n\n== Plot ==\nMidge ([[Rachel Brosnahan]]) and her mother, Rose ([[Marin Hinkle]]), select outfits for their family's annual vacation to the [[Catskill Mountains|Catskills]]. Later, Midge and Susie ([[Alex Borstein]]) meet at a diner and Midge tells her she is going away on vacation for two months, to Susie's displeasure. \n\nMidge, her mother, father ([[Tony Shalhoub]]), and children drive to Steiner Mountain Resort, a vacation resort that caters to affluent Jewish people. Joel ([[Michael Zegen]]) meets them later and asks to stay on their couch because he forgot to reserve his own room. That Midge is now separated from Joel brings forth judgment from the other vacationers. The camp director ([[Saul Rubinek]]) tells her that she is ineligible to compete in the bikini competition because she is technically no longer a wife. At the opening reception, Joel takes the stage to tell the other guests to treat Midge with respect, which pleases Midge and her family.  \n\nMidge and her mother go to the beauty salon. Midge lies and says she has been dating and Rose tells her she will be on the lookout for any good men. Susie later surprises Midge by meeting her in the woods, and says she is posing as a plumber while attempting to book gigs for Midge in the area. \n\nRose urges Midge to meet a single Jewish doctor named Benjamin ([[Zachary Levi]]), the son of a guest Rose met at the salon. Midge finds and interrupts him to insist they spend some time together so that she can tell her mother that they met and it didn't work out. They get in a rowboat but Benjamin refuses to row, to Midge's embarrassment. \n\nThat night Midge and her parents sit on a blanket on the resort grounds watching fireworks. Joel observes them from a distance. Benjamin, a stranger to him, approaches Joel to bum a cigarette. They smoke together and have a short existential conversation about forgiveness.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.avclub.com/nobody-puts-midge-in-a-corner-when-the-marvelous-mrs-m-1830867346|title=Nobody puts Midge in a corner when The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel goes to the Catskills|website=The A.V.

It was written and directed by [[Daniel Palladino]]. The plot follows Midge and her family's trip to a Jewish resort in the [[Catskill Mountains]] for the summer. Susie poses as an employee of the resort while booking gigs for Midge. Midge meets Benjamin ([[Zachary Levi]]), a bachelor physician who is also vacationing at the resort.\n\n\"We're Going to the Catskills!\" was released on December 5, 2018 on [[Amazon Prime]]. For the episode, the director was nominated for a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] and a [[Directors Guild of America Award]]. [[Tony Shalhoub]] received an Emmy in the Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series category. The episode also won three Primetime Emmy Creative Arts Awards from six total nominations.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> \n\n== Plot ==\nMidge ([[Rachel Brosnahan]]) and her mother, Rose ([[Marin Hinkle]]), select outfits for their family's annual vacation to the [[Catskill Mountains|Catskills]]. Later, Midge and Susie ([[Alex Borstein]]) meet at a diner and Midge tells her she is going away on vacation for two months, to Susie's displeasure. \n\nMidge, her mother, father ([[Tony Shalhoub]]), and children drive to Steiner Mountain Resort, a vacation resort that caters to affluent Jewish people. Joel ([[Michael Zegen]]) meets them later and asks to stay on their couch because he forgot to reserve his own room. That Midge is now separated from Joel has caused judgment from the other vacationers. The camp director ([[Saul Rubinek]]) tells her that she is ineligible to compete in the bikini competition because she is technically no longer a wife. At the opening reception, Joel takes the stage to tell the other guests to treat Midge with respect, which pleases Midge and her family.  \n\nMidge and her mother go to the beauty salon. Midge lies and says she has been dating and Rose tells her she will be on the lookout for any good men. Susie later surprises Midge by meeting her in the woods, and says she is posing as a plumber while attempting to book gigs for Midge in the area. \n\nRose urges Midge to meet a single Jewish doctor named Benjamin ([[Zachary Levi]]), the son of a guest Rose met at the salon. Midge finds and interrupts him to insist they spend some time together so that she can tell her mother that they met and it didn't work out. They get in a rowboat but Benjamin refuses to row, to Midge's embarrassment. \n\nThat night Midge and her parents sit on a blanket on the resort grounds watching fireworks. Joel observes them from a distance. Benjamin, a stranger to him, approaches Joel to bum a cigarette. They smoke together and have a short existential conversation about forgiveness.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.avclub.com/nobody-puts-midge-in-a-corner-when-the-marvelous-mrs-m-1830867346|title=Nobody puts Midge in a corner when The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel goes to the Catskills|website=The A.V.
