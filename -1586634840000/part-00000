She was noticed internationally when she stepped in for a performance of Donizetti's ''[[Lucrezia Borgia (opera)|Lucrezia Borgia]]'' at [[Carnegie Hall]] in 1965, and then appeared at leading opera houses. Her voice was described as pure but powerful, with superb control of vocal shadings and exquisite [[Dynamics (music)|pianissimo]].\n\nCaball\u00e9 became popular to non-classical music audiences in 1987, when she recorded, at the request of the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]], \"[[Barcelona (Freddie Mercury and Montserrat Caball\u00e9 song)|Barcelona]]\", a duet with [[Freddie Mercury]], which became an official theme song for the [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Olympic Games]].

She became part of the [[Theater Basel|Basel Opera]] company between 1957 and 1959, singing a repertoire that included Mozart (Erste Dame in ''[[The Magic Flute|Die Zauberfl\u00f6te]]'') and Strauss (''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'') in German, unusual for Spanish singers, but which proved useful for her next engagement at the [[Theater Bremen|Bremen Opera]] (1959\u20131962).

She was noticed internationally when she stepped in for a performance of Donizetti's ''[[Lucrezia Borgia (opera)|Lucrezia Borgia]]'' at [[Carnegie Hall]] in 1965, and then appeared at leading opera houses. Her voice was described as pure but powerful, with superb control of vocal shadings and exquisite [[Dynamics (music)|pianissimo]].\n\nCaball\u00e9 became popular to non-classical music audiences in 1987, when she recorded, at the request of the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]], \"[[Barcelona (Freddie Mercury and Montserrat Caball\u00e9 song)|Barcelona]]\", a duet with [[Freddie Mercury]], which became an official theme song for the [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Olympic Games]].

She became part of the [[Theater Basel|Basel Opera]] company between 1957 and 1959, singing a repertoire that included Mozart (Erste Dame in ''[[The Magic Flute|Die Zauberfl\u00f6te]]'') and Strauss (''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'') in German, unusual for Spanish singers, but which proved useful for her next engagement at the [[Theater Bremen|Bremen Opera]] (1959\u20131962). In 1961, she starred as Iphig\u00e9nie in Gluck's ''[[Iphig\u00e9nie en Tauride (Gluck)|Iphig\u00e9nie en Tauride]]'' at the [[Teatro Nacional de S\u00e3o Carlos|National Theatre of S.

While this was her first engagement in a bel canto opera and she had to learn the role in less than one month, her performance made her famous throughout the opera world.

A young waitress, Zoe Moon ([[Perrey Reeves]]), finds and notices infant twin children Anna and Danny, who create a wave of purple energy when their hands touch. Before she can do anything, the children are separated when a hermit, Bruno ([[Brad Dourif]]), places Anna on a truck but flees when he is spotted by Sheriff Bronson ([[Kevin Tighe]]).\n\nDanny ([[Erik von Detten]]) spends the next nine years of his life between foster families and frequently runs away. After his latest attempt is thwarted, his frustrated social worker decides to leave him at an orphanage run by Lindsay Brown ([[Lynne Moody]]). He is reunited with Anna ([[Elisabeth Moss]]) when she saves him from Xander (Sam Horrigan), an older boy at the orphanage who has a soft spot for Anna. Neither Danny or Anna are initially aware of their relationship, despite performing identical odd mannerisms.  However, their newly found proximity to one another reawakens their supernatural powers and they realize that they are siblings.  When Edward Bolt ([[Robert Vaughn]]), a local [[Business magnate|magnate]] seeking to develop the nearby Witch Mountain, notices their powers, he decides to care for both of them as their foster father. Though Danny is happy with the development because he has his sister and a nice home, Anna is apprehensive about being adopted by Bolt and befriends Bolt's chauffeur, Luthor ([[Brad Dourif]]), who feels he has a connection to the twins.\n\nDuring one of their outings to a purple general store, Anna uses her telekinetic abilities and catches the attention of the store's owner, Waldo Fudd ([[Vincent Schiavelli]]). Waldo reveals he has the same abilities they do and that they are extraterrestrials from another world where everyone has a twin. When they came to Earth to explore, everyone separated due to the quarrels they experienced on Earth.   Waldo has been working to reunite them all and take them home. Meanwhile, Zoe sees the purple light from the front of the shop and recognizes it and confronts Waldo to discover the fate of the twins she saw years earlier.  Though he dismisses her claims, Waldo leaves her clues regarding Anna and Danny's fates if she wishes to help them.\n\nBolt reveals his true intention to exploit the twins' power to blast open Witch Mountain without explosives in order to obtain its valuable [[Uranium|rock material]], despite Waldo's protest that the mountain must not be tampered with.  Anna discovers the truth and telepathically warns Danny, only to be held hostage by Bolt so that Danny will do as he asks. The twins are rescued by Xander and escape to Waldo's shop on a horse that Danny communicates with to help them. Lindsay becomes suspicious of Bolt when he sends the police to retrieve the children from the shop.\n\nZoe and Bruno help Danny and Anna escape to Witch Mountain after the twins levitate Bruno's truck, while Bolt is arrested by Bronson after Luthor exposes Bolt's plot. At Witch Mountain, Waldo and the other reunited twins await Anna and Danny so they can all return home.  The last set of twins arrive soon after - Bruno and Luthor. Using Waldo and his twin's power on their home world, all of the twins return home in pairs, with Anna and Danny going last to close the [[gate]] between their home world and Earth. Waldo casually comments that he will be waiting for the next group of tourists, while Anna and Danny float up into the purple smoke to Witch Mountain. Zoe narrates that Witch Mountain is not haunted but has light in it.\n\n{{Anchor|Critical reception|Critics}}\n<!-- No reviews listed http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/escape-to-witch-mountain1995/ -->\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Elisabeth Moss]] as Anna\n* [[Erik von Detten]] as Danny\n* [[Perrey Reeves]] as Zoe Moon\n* [[Robert Vaughn]] as Edward Bolt\n* [[Lynne Moody]] as Lindsay Brown\n* [[Lauren Tom]] as Claudia Ford\n* [[Vincent Schiavelli]] as Waldo Fudd\n* [[Henry Gibson]] as Ravetch\n* [[Bobby Motown]] as Skeeto\n* [[Kevin Tighe]] as Sheriff Bronson\n* [[Brad Dourif]] as Bruno the Hermit, Luthor\n* John Petlock as Butler\n* Beth Colt as Woman officer\n* Daniel Lavery as Mr. Flynn\n* Jeffrey Lampert as Man on TV\n* Ray Lykins as Deputy\n* Jennifer & Marissa Bullock as baby Anna\n*Nikki & Sammi Allen as baby Danny\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Escape to Witch Mountain (1975 film)|Escape to Witch Mountain]]'', the original 1975 theatrical film\n*''[[Return from Witch Mountain]]'', the 1978 theatrical sequel\n*''[[Beyond Witch Mountain]]'', the 1982 television sequel\n*''[[Race to Witch Mountain]]'', the 2009 Disney remake of the 1975 film\n*[[Alexander Key]],  the author of ''[[Escape to Witch Mountain]]'', the 1968 science fiction novel\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0112985|title=Escape to Witch Mountain}}\n\n{{Witch Mountain}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Escape To Witch Mountain (1995 Film)}}\n[[Category:1995 television films]]\n[[Category:1990s fantasy adventure films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction films]]\n[[Category:1990s science fiction films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American film remakes]]\n[[Category:American fantasy adventure films]]\n[[Category:American children's films]]\n[[Category:Disney television films]]\n[[Category:Disney film remakes]]\n[[Category:Witch Mountain films]]\n[[Category:Films about telekinesis]]\n[[Category:Television remakes of films]]\n[[Category:Walt Disney anthology television series episodes]]\n[[Category:Witch Mountain series]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=July 2017}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name      = Escape to Witch Mountain\n| image          = \n| caption        = \n| genre          = Adventure<br>Family<br>Fantasy\n| director       = Peter Rader\n| executive_producer = Scott Immergut<br />[[Les Mayfield]]<br />George Zaloom\n| producer       = Joan Van Horn\n| screenplay     = Peter Rader\n| based_on       = {{based on|''[[Escape to Witch Mountain]]''|[[Alexander Key]]}}\n| starring       = [[Elisabeth Moss]]<br />[[Erik von Detten]]<br />[[Perrey Reeves]]<br />[[Robert Vaughn]]<br />[[Vincent Schiavelli]]<br />[[Brad Dourif]]\n| location       =\n| music          = Richard Marvin\n| cinematography = Russ T.

Whereas men are basically rational, women operate only at the level of their emotions and sexual organs. Jews, Weininger argued, are similar, saturated with femininity, with no sense of right and wrong, and no soul. Weininger argues that man must choose between his masculine and feminine sides, consciousness and unconsciousness, Platonic love and sexuality. Love and sexual desire stand in contradiction, and love between a woman and a man is therefore doomed to misery or immorality. The only life worth living is the spiritual one\u2014to live as a woman or a Jew means one has no right to live at all; the choice is genius or death. Weininger committed suicide, shooting himself in 1903, shortly after publishing the book.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=19-26}} Wittgenstein, then 14, attended Weininger's funeral.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GHJjAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA229 |page=229|title=Hitler's Vienna: A Dictator's Apprenticeship|isbn=9780195140538|last1=Hamann|first1=Brigitte|year=2000}}</ref> Many years later, as a professor at the [[University of Cambridge]], Wittgenstein distributed copies of Weininger's book to his bemused academic colleagues. He said that Weininger's arguments were wrong, but that it was the way they were wrong that was interesting.<ref>p216, Philosophical Tales, Cohen, M., Blackwell 2008</ref> In a letter dated 23 August 1931, Wittgenstein wrote the following to [[G. E. Moore]];<blockquote>Dear Moore,</blockquote><blockquote>Thanks for your letter. I can quite imagine that you don't admire Weininger very much, what with that beastly translation and the fact that W. must feel very foreign to you. It is true that he is fantastic but he is great and fantastic. It isn't necessary or rather not possible to agree with him but the greatness lies in that with which we disagree. It is his enormous mistake which is great. I.e. roughly speaking if you just add a \u201c\u223c\u201d to the whole book it says an important truth.{{sfn|McGuinness|2008|p=141}}</blockquote>In an unusual move, Wittgenstein took out a copy of Weininger's work on 1 June 1931 from the Special Order Books in the university library.

He attended for three semesters, and was awarded a [[diploma]] (''Abgangzeugnis'') on 5 May 1908.\n\nDuring his time at the Institute, Wittgenstein developed an interest in [[aeronautics]].{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=27}} He arrived at the [[Victoria University of Manchester]] in the spring of 1908 to study for a doctorate, full of plans for aeronautical projects, including designing and flying his own plane. He conducted research into the behavior of kites in the upper atmosphere, experimenting at a meteorological observation site near [[Glossop]].{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=29}} Specifically, the [[Royal Meteorological Society]] researched and investigated the ionization of the upper atmosphere, by suspending instruments on balloons or kites.

Wittgenstein's design required air and gas to be forced along the propeller arms to combustion chambers on the end of each blade, where it was then compressed by the centrifugal force exerted by the revolving arms and ignited. Propellers of the time were typically wood, whereas modern blades are made from pressed steel laminates as separate halves, which are then welded together. This gives the blade a hollow interior, and therefore creates an ideal pathway for the air and gas.<ref name=\"Lemco 39\u201351\" />\n\n[[File:11.

Norton.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=36}} Wittgenstein started following him after lectures back to his rooms to discuss more philosophy, until it was time for the evening meal in [[Formal (university)#Terminology|Hall]]. Russell grew irritated; he wrote to his lover [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]]: \"My German friend threatens to be an infliction.\"{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|pp=88-89}}\nRussell soon came to believe that Wittgenstein was a genius, especially after he had examined Wittgenstein's written work. He wrote in November 1911 that he had at first thought Wittgenstein might be a crank, but soon decided he was a genius: \"Some of his early views made the decision difficult. He maintained, for example, at one time that all existential propositions are meaningless. This was in a lecture room, and I invited him to consider the proposition: 'There is no hippopotamus in this room at present.' When he refused to believe this, I looked under all the desks without finding one; but he remained unconvinced.\"{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|p=88}} Three months after Wittgenstein's arrival Russell told Morrell: \"I love him & feel he will solve the problems I am too old to solve ... He is ''the'' young man one hopes for.\"{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=41}} Wittgenstein later told David Pinsent that Russell's encouragement had proven his salvation, and had ended nine years of loneliness and suffering, during which he had continually thought of suicide. In encouraging him to pursue philosophy and in justifying his inclination to abandon engineering, Russell had, quite literally, saved Wittgenstein's life.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=41}} The role-reversal between Bertrand Russell and Wittgenstein was soon such that Russell wrote in 1916, after Wittgenstein had criticized Russell's own work: \"His [Wittgenstein]'s criticism, tho' I don't think you realized it at the time, was an event of first-rate importance in my life, and affected everything I have done since.

Popper's paper was \"Are there philosophical problems?\", in which he struck up a position against Wittgenstein's, contending that problems in philosophy are real, not just linguistic puzzles as Wittgenstein argued. Accounts vary as to what happened next, but Wittgenstein apparently started waving a hot poker, demanding that Popper give him an example of a moral rule. Popper offered one\u2014\"Not to threaten visiting speakers with pokers\"\u2014at which point Russell told Wittgenstein he had misunderstood and Wittgenstein left.

Russell had been worried that Wittgenstein would not appreciate the group's raucous style of intellectual debate, its precocious sense of humour, and the fact that the members were often in love with one another.{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|p=118}} He was admitted in 1912 but resigned almost immediately because he could not tolerate the style of discussion. Nevertheless, the Cambridge Apostles allowed Wittgenstein to participate in meetings again in the 1920s when he had returned to [[Cambridge]]. Reportedly, Wittgenstein also had trouble tolerating the discussions in the Cambridge Moral Sciences Club.\n\n=== Frustrations at Cambridge===\nWittgenstein was quite vocal about his depression in his years at Cambridge, and before he went to war; on many an occasion, he told Russell of his woes. His mental anguish seemed to stem from two sources: his work, and his personal life. Wittgenstein made numerous remarks to Russell about logic driving him mad.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=76}} Wittgenstein also stated to Russell that he \"felt the curse of those who have half a talent\".{{sfn|McGuinness|2008|p=39}} He later expresses this same worry, and tells of being in mediocre spirits due to his lack of progress in his logical work.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Wittgenstein in Cambridge|last=|first=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=59}}</ref> Monk writes that Wittgenstein lived and breathed logic, and a temporary lack of inspiration plunged him into despair.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=75}} Unless he was lying, Wittgenstein tells of his work in logic affecting his mental status in a very extreme way. However, he also tells Russell another story. Around Christmas, in 1913, he writes: \"how can I be a logician before I'm a human being? For the most important thing is coming to terms with myself!\"{{sfn|McGuinness|2008|p=63}} He also tells Russell on an occasion in Russell\u2019s rooms that he was worried about logic and his sins; also, once upon arrival to Russell's rooms one night Wittgenstein announced to Russell that he would kill himself once he left.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Portraits of Wittgenstein, Volume 1 |last=Flowers |first=F.A., III |last2=Ground |first2=Ian |date=22 October 2015 |isbn=9781472589781|location=|pages=151 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7VfiCgAAQBAJ }}</ref> Of things Wittgenstein personally told Russell, Ludwig\u2019s temperament was also recorded in the diary of [[David Pinsent]].

Marguerite Respinger sits at the end of the left and the sculpture he made of her sits behind him on the mantel-place]]\nWittgenstein had romantic relations with both men and women. He is generally believed to have fallen in love with at least three men, and had a relationship with the latter two: [[David Pinsent|David Hume Pinsent]] in 1912, [[Francis Skinner]] in 1930, and Ben Richards in the late 1940s.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=583-586}} He later revealed that, as a teenager in Vienna, he had had an affair with a woman.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=369}} Additionally, in the 1920s Wittgenstein fell in love with a young Swiss woman, Marguerite Respinger, modelling a sculpture of her and proposing marriage, albeit on condition that they would not have children.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=238-240, 318}}\n\nWittgenstein's relationship with David Pinsent (1891\u20131918) occurred during an intellectually formative period, and is well documented. Bertrand Russell introduced Wittgenstein to Pinsent in the summer of 1912. A mathematics undergraduate and descendant of [[David Hume]], Pinsent soon became Wittgenstein's closest friend.<ref>Goldstein, Laurence. ''Clear and queer thinking: Wittgenstein's development and his relevance to modern thought''. Rowman & Littlefield, 1999, p. 179.</ref> The men worked together on experiments in the psychology laboratory about the role of rhythm in the appreciation of music, and Wittgenstein delivered a paper on the subject to the [[British Psychological Society|British Psychological Association]] in Cambridge in 1912. They also travelled together, including to Iceland in September 1912\u2014the expenses paid by Wittgenstein, including [[first class travel]], the hiring of a private train, and new clothes and spending money for Pinsent. In addition to Iceland, Wittgenstein and Pinsent traveled to Norway in 1913. Upon determining their destination, Wittgenstein and Pinsent visited a tourist office in search for a location that would fulfill the following criteria \u2013 small village located on a Fjord, a location away from tourists, and a peaceful destination to allow them to study logic and law.<ref>Portraits of Wittgenstein, Extracts from the Diary of David Pinsent 1912\u20131914, p. 221.</ref> Suggesting [[\u00d8ystese]], Wittgenstein and Pinsent arrived in the small village on 4 September 1913. With their vacation lasting almost three weeks, Wittgenstein was able to work vigorously on his studies. The immense progress on logic during their stay led Wittgenstein to express to Pinsent his idea to leave Cambridge and return to Norway to continue his work on logic.<ref>Portraits of Wittgenstein, Extracts from the Diary of David Pinsent 1912\u20131914, p.230.</ref> Pinsent's diaries provide valuable insights into Wittgenstein's personality \u2013 sensitive, nervous and attuned to the tiniest slight or change in mood from Pinsent.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=58ff}}<ref name=Wright/> Pinsent also writes of Wittgenstein being \"absolutely sulky and snappish\" at times, as well.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=85}} In his diaries Pinsent wrote about shopping for furniture with Wittgenstein in Cambridge when the latter was given rooms in Trinity; most of what they found in the stores was not minimalist enough for Wittgenstein's aesthetics: \"I went and helped him interview a lot of furniture at various shops ... It was rather amusing: he is terribly fastidious and we led the shopman a frightful dance, Vittgenstein [sic] ejaculating \"No\u2014Beastly!\" to 90 percent of what he shewed [archaic spelling] us!\"<ref name=\"Kanterian40\">Kanterian, p. 40.</ref>\n\nHe wrote in May 1912 that Wittgenstein had just begun to study the history of philosophy: \"He expresses the most naive surprise that all the philosophers he once worshipped in ignorance are after all stupid and dishonest and make disgusting mistakes!\"<ref name=Kanterian40/> The last time they saw each other was on 8 October 1913 at Lordswood House in Birmingham, then residence of the Pinsent family: \"I got up at 6.15 to see Ludwig off.

Trakl requested to meet his benefactor but in 1914 when Wittgenstein went to visit, Trakl had killed himself.  Wittgenstein came to feel that he could not get to the heart of his most fundamental questions while surrounded by other academics, and so in 1913 he retreated to the village of [[Skjolden]] in Norway, where he rented the second floor of a house for the winter. He later saw this as one of the most productive periods of his life, writing ''Logik'' (''Notes on Logic''), the predecessor of much of the ''Tractatus''.<ref name=ConnorRobertson/> While in Norway, Wittgenstein learned [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] to converse with the local villagers, and [[Danish language|Danish]] to read the works of the Danish philosopher [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]].<ref>[[Jon Stewart (philosopher)|Stewart, Jon.]] (ed.) ''Kierkegaard's Influence on Philosophy: German and Scandinavian Philosophy''. Ashgate Publishing, 2009, p. 216.</ref>\n\nIt was during this time that Wittgenstein began addressing what he considered to be a central issue in ''Notes on Logic'', a general decision procedure for determining the truth value of logical propositions which would stem from a single primitive proposition. He became convinced during this time that \u201c[a]ll the propositions of logic are generalizations of tautologies and all generalizations of tautologies are generalizations of logic. There are no other logical propositions.\u201d{{sfn|McGuinness|2008|p=58}} Based on this, Wittgenstein argued that propositions of logic express their truth or falsehood in the sign itself, and one need not know anything about the constituent parts of the proposition to determine it true or false. Rather, one simply need identify the statement as a tautology (true), a contradiction (false), or neither.\n\nThe problem lay in forming a primitive proposition which encompassed this and would act as the basis for all of logic. As he stated in correspondence with Russell in late 1913, \u201cThe big question now is, how must a system of signs be constituted in order to make every tautology recognizable as such IN ONE AND THE SAME WAY? This is the fundamental problem of logic!\u201d {{sfn|McGuinness|2008|p=59}} The importance Wittgenstein placed upon this fundamental problem was so great that he believed if he did not solve it, he had no reason or right to live.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=96}} Despite this apparent life-or-death importance, Wittgenstein had given up on this primitive proposition by the time of the writing of the ''Tractatus''. The ''Tractatus'' does not offer any general process for identifying propositions as tautologies; in a simpler manner, \u201cEvery tautology itself shows that it is a tautology.\u201d<ref>Wittgenstein, Ludwig. ''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus: Side-By-Side-By-Side Edition''. Kegan Paul, 1922, p. 98.</ref> This shift to understanding tautologies through mere identification or recognition occurred in 1914 when Moore was called on by Wittgenstein to assist him in dictating his notes.\n\nAt Wittgenstein's insistence, Moore, who was now a Cambridge don, visited him in Norway in 1914, reluctantly because Wittgenstein exhausted him. [[David Edmonds (philosopher)|David Edmonds]] and John Eidinow write that Wittgenstein regarded Moore, an internationally known philosopher, as an example of how far someone could get in life with \"absolutely no intelligence whatever.\"{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=262}} In Norway it was clear that Moore was expected to act as Wittgenstein's secretary, taking down his notes, with Wittgenstein falling into a rage when Moore got something wrong.<ref name=Edmonds45/> When he returned to Cambridge, Moore asked the university to consider accepting ''Logik'' as sufficient for a bachelor's degree, but they refused, saying it wasn't formatted properly: no footnotes, no preface. Wittgenstein was furious, writing to Moore in May 1914: \"If I am not worth your making an exception for me ''even in some STUPID details'' then I may as well go to Hell directly; and if I ''am'' worth it and you don't do it then\u2014by God\u2014''you'' might go there.\"{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=103}} Moore was apparently distraught; he wrote in his diary that he felt sick and could not get the letter out of his head.{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|p=200}} The two did not speak again until 1929.<ref name=Edmonds45>Edmonds, Eidinow 2001, pp. 45\u201346.</ref>\n\n===Military service===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1970-073-25, Isonzo-Schlacht, Trainkolonne am Moistroka-Pass.jpg|thumb|Austro-Hungarian supply line over the [[Vr\u0161i\u010d Pass]], on the [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italian front]], October 1917|204x204px]]\nOn the outbreak of World War I, Wittgenstein immediately volunteered for the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]], despite being eligible for a medical exemption.<ref name=\"thinkers at war\">{{cite web |authorlink=Iain King |first=Iain |last=King |title=THINKERS AT WAR \u2013 Wittgenstein |url=https://www.military-history.org/articles/thinkers-at-war-wittgenstein.htm |work=Military History Monthly |accessdate=23 July 2014 |date=17 April 2014 }}</ref><ref name=philosophynow>{{cite magazine |magazine=[[Philosophy Now]] |url=https://philosophynow.org/issues/103/WittgensteinTolstoy_and_the_Folly_of_Logical_Positivism |title=Wittgenstein,Tolstoy and the Folly of Logical Positivism |first=Stuart |last=Greenstreet |accessdate=23 July 2014 }}</ref> He served first on a ship and then in an artillery workshop 'several miles from the action'.<ref name=\"thinkers at war\"/> He was wounded in an accidental explosion, and hospitalised to [[Krak\u00f3w]].<ref name=\"thinkers at war\"/> In March 1916, he was posted to a fighting unit on the front line of the Russian front, as part of the [[7th Army (Austria-Hungary)|Austrian 7th Army]], where his unit was involved in some of the heaviest fighting, defending against the [[Brusilov Offensive]].{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=137-142}} Wittgenstein directed the fire of his own artillery from an observation post in no-man's land against Allied troops \u2013 one of the most dangerous jobs there was, since he was targeted by enemy fire.<ref name=philosophynow/> In action against British troops, he was decorated with the [[Military Merit Medal (Austria\u2013Hungary)|Military Merit]] with Swords on the Ribbon, and was commended by the army for \"His exceptionally courageous behaviour, calmness, sang-froid, and heroism,\" that \"won the total admiration of the troops.\"<ref>Waugh, p. 114.</ref> In January 1917, he was sent as a member of a [[howitzer]] regiment to the Russian front, where he won several more medals for bravery including the [[Medal for Bravery (Austria-Hungary)|Silver Medal for Valour]], First Class.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=137}} In 1918, he was promoted to lieutenant and sent to the [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italian front]] as part of an artillery regiment.

He apparently talked incessantly about suicide, terrifying his sisters and brother Paul. He decided to do two things: to enroll in teacher training college as an elementary school teacher, and to get rid of his fortune. In 1914, it had been providing him with an income of 300,000 [[Austro-Hungarian krone|Kronen]] a year, but by 1919 was worth a great deal more, with a sizable portfolio of investments in the [[United States]] and the [[Netherlands]].

At first he applied, under a false name, for a teaching post at Reichenau, was awarded the job, but he declined it when his identity was discovered. As a teacher, he wished to no longer be recognized as a member of the famous Wittgenstein family. In response, his brother Paul wrote: <blockquote>\"It is out of the question, really completely out of the question, that anybody bearing our name and whose elegant and gentle upbringing can be seen a thousand paces off, would not be identified as a member of our family...

Ramsey|Frank Ramsey]], a mathematics undergraduate at King's commissioned by [[C. K. Ogden]]. It was Moore who suggested ''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus'' for the title, an allusion to [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s ''Tractatus Theologico-Politicus.'' Initially there were difficulties in finding a publisher for the English edition too, because Wittgenstein was insisting it appear without Russell's introduction; Cambridge University Press turned it down for that reason. Finally in 1922 an agreement was reached with Wittgenstein that Kegan Paul would print a bilingual edition with Russell's introduction and the Ramsey-Ogden translation.<ref name=\"archive tractacus\"/> This is the translation that was approved by Wittgenstein, but it is problematic in a number of ways. Wittgenstein's English was poor at the time, and Ramsey was a teenager who had only recently learned German, so philosophers often prefer to use a 1961 translation by [[David Pears]] and Brian McGuinness.<ref>For example, Ramsey translated \"''Sachverhalt''\" and \"''Sachlage''\" as \"atomic fact\" and \"state of affairs\" respectively. But Wittgenstein discusses non-existent \"''Sachverhalten''\", and there cannot be a non-existent fact. Pears and McGuinness made a number of changes, including translating \"''Sachverhalt''\" as \"state of affairs\" and \"''Sachlage''\" as ''situation''. The new translation is often preferred, but some philosophers use the original, in part because Wittgenstein approved it, and because it avoids the idiomatic English of Pears-McGuinness.

Wittgenstein argues that the logical structure of language provides the limits of meaning. The limits of language, for Wittgenstein, are the limits of philosophy. Much of philosophy involves attempts to say the unsayable: \"What we can say at all can be said clearly,\" he argues. Anything beyond that\u2014religion, ethics, aesthetics, the mystical\u2014cannot be discussed.

Wittgenstein, 1925.jpg|thumb|Wittgenstein, 1925]]\nHe moved schools again in September 1924, this time to [[Otterthal]], near Trattenbach; the socialist headmaster, Josef Putre, was someone Wittgenstein had become friends with while at Trattenbach. While he was there, he wrote a 42-page pronunciation and spelling dictionary for the children, ''W\u00f6rterbuch f\u00fcr Volksschulen'', published in Vienna in 1926 by H\u00f6lder-Pichler-Tempsky, the only book of his apart from the ''Tractatus'' that was published in his lifetime.<ref name=\"archive tractacus\"/> A first edition sold in 2005 for \u00a375,000.<ref name=\"Ezard\">{{cite news |last=Ezard |first=John |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/feb/19/books.booksnews2 |title=Philosopher's rare 'other book' goes on sale |work=The Guardian |date=19 February 2005 }}</ref>\n\nAn incident occurred in April 1926 and became known as ''Der Vorfall Haidbauer'' (the Haidbauer incident). Josef Haidbauer was an 11-year-old pupil whose father had died and whose mother worked as a local maid. He was a slow learner, and one day Wittgenstein hit him two or three times on the head, causing him to collapse. Wittgenstein carried him to the headmaster's office, then quickly left the school, bumping into a parent, Herr Piribauer, on the way out. Piribauer had been sent for by the children when they saw Haidbauer collapse; Wittgenstein had previously pulled Piribauer's daughter, Hermine, so hard by the ears that her ears had bled.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=224, 232\u2013233}} Piribauer said that when he met Wittgenstein in the hall that day: \"I called him all the names under the sun. I told him he wasn't a teacher, he was an animal-trainer! And that I was going to fetch the police right away!\"{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=225}}\n\nPiribauer tried to have Wittgenstein arrested, but the village's police station was empty, and when he tried again the next day he was told Wittgenstein had disappeared. On 28 April 1926, Wittgenstein handed in his resignation to Wilhelm Kundt, a local school inspector, who tried to persuade him to stay; however, Wittgenstein was adamant that his days as a schoolteacher were over.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=225}} Proceedings were initiated in May, and the judge ordered a psychiatric report; in August 1926 a letter to Wittgenstein from a friend, Ludwig H\u00e4nsel, indicates that hearings were ongoing, but nothing is known about the case after that. Alexander Waugh writes that Wittgenstein's family and their money may have had a hand in covering things up. Waugh writes that Haidbauer died shortly afterwards of haemophilia; Monk says he died when he was 14 of [[leukaemia]].<ref>Waugh, p. 162.</ref>{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=232}}\n\nTen years later, in 1936, as part of a series of \"confessions\" he engaged in that year, Wittgenstein appeared without warning at the village saying he wanted to confess personally and ask for pardon from the children he had hit. He visited at least four of the children, including Hermine Piribauer, who apparently replied only with a \"Ja, ja,\" though other former students were more hospitable. Monk writes that the purpose of these confessions was not \"to hurt his pride, as a form of punishment; it was to dismantle it\u2014to remove a barrier, as it were, that stood in the way of honest and decent thought.\" Of the apologies, Wittgenstein wrote, \"This brought me into more settled waters... and to greater seriousness.\"{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=370-371}}\n\n===The Vienna Circle===\n{{See also|Vienna Circle}}\nThe ''Tractatus'' was now the subject of much debate amongst philosophers, and Wittgenstein was a figure of increasing international fame. In particular, a discussion group of philosophers, scientists and mathematicians, known as the [[Vienna Circle]], had built up purportedly as a result of the inspiration they had been given by reading the ''Tractatus''.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=212}} While it is commonly assumed that Wittgenstein was a part of the Vienna Circle, in reality, this was not actually the case. German philosopher [[Oswald Hanfling]] writes bluntly: \"Wittgenstein was never a member of the Circle, though he was in Vienna during much of the time. Yet his influence on the Circle's thought was at least as important as that of any of its members.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = Essential Readings in Logical Positivism|last = Hanfling|first = Oswald |author-link=Oswald Hanfling |publisher = Basil Blackwell|year = 1981|isbn = 978-0-631-12566-2|location = Oxford|pages = 3}}</ref> However, the philosopher [[A. C. Grayling]] contends that while certain superficial similarities between Wittgenstein's early philosophy and [[logical positivism]] led its members to study the ''Tractatus'' in detail and to arrange discussions with him, Wittgenstein's influence on the Circle was rather limited. The fundamental philosophical views of Circle had been established before they met Wittgenstein and had their origins in the [[Empiricism|British empiricists]], [[Ernst Mach]], and the logic of [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]] and Russell. Whatever influence Wittgenstein did have on the Circle was largely limited to [[Moritz Schlick]] and [[Friedrich Waismann]] and, even in these cases, resulted in little lasting effect on their positivism. Grayling states: \"...it is no longer possible to think of the ''Tractatus'' as having inspired a philosophical movement, as most earlier commentators claimed.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Wittgenstein : a very short introduction|last=Grayling, A. C.|publisher=|isbn=0192854119|location=Oxford|pages=[https://archive.org/details/wittgensteinvery00acgr/page/65 65\u201372]|oclc=46909597|date=22 February 2001|url=https://archive.org/details/wittgensteinvery00acgr/page/65}}</ref> From 1926, with the members of the Vienna Circle, Wittgenstein would take part in many discussions. However, during these discussions, it soon became evident that Wittgenstein held a different attitude towards philosophy than the members of the Circle. For example, during meetings of the Vienna Circle, he would express his disagreement with the group's misreading of his work by turning his back to them and reading poetry aloud.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2012/09/07/the-limits-of-science-and-scientists/|title=The Limits of Science\u2014and Scientists - The Crux|date=7 September 2012|accessdate=16 February 2018}}</ref>  In his autobiography, [[Rudolf Carnap]] describes Wittgenstein as the thinker who gave him the greatest inspiration. However, he also wrote that \"there was a striking difference between Wittgenstein's attitude toward philosophical problems and that of Schlick and myself. Our attitude toward philosophical problems was not very different from that which scientists have toward their problems.\" As for Wittgenstein:\n{{quote|His point of view and his attitude toward people and problems, even theoretical problems, were much more similar to those of a creative artist than to those of a scientist; one might almost say, similar to those of a religious prophet or a seer... When finally, sometimes after a prolonged arduous effort, his answers came forth, his statement stood before us like a newly created piece of art or a divine revelation ... the impression he made on us was as if insight came to him as through divine inspiration, so that we could not help feeling that any sober rational comment or analysis of it would be a profanation.<ref>Rudolf Carnap, ''Autobiography'', in P.A.

His sister, Margaret, invited him to help with the design of her new townhouse in Vienna's ''Kundmanngasse''. Wittgenstein, his friend [[Paul Engelmann]], and a team of architects developed a spare modernist house. In particular, Wittgenstein focused on the windows, doors, and radiators, demanding that every detail be exactly as he specified. When the house was nearly finished Wittgenstein had an entire ceiling raised 30mm so that the room had the exact proportions he wanted. Monk writes that \"This is not so marginal as it may at first appear, for it is precisely these details that lend what is otherwise a rather plain, even ugly house its distinctive beauty.\"<ref name=\"Jeffries\">{{cite news |last=Jeffries |first=Stuart |url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/politicsphilosophyandsociety/story/0,,627752,00.html |title=A dwelling for the gods |work=The Guardian |date=5 January 2002 }}</ref>\n\nIt took him a year to design the door handles and another to design the radiators. Each window was covered by a metal screen that weighed {{convert|150|kg}}, moved by a pulley Wittgenstein designed. Bernhard Leitner, author of ''The Architecture of Ludwig Wittgenstein'', said there is barely anything comparable in the history of interior design: \"It is as ingenious as it is expensive. A metal curtain that could be lowered into the floor.\"<ref name=Jeffries/>\n\nThe house was finished by December 1928 and the family gathered there at Christmas to celebrate its completion. Wittgenstein's sister Hermine wrote: \"Even though I admired the house very much....It seemed indeed to be much more a dwelling for the gods.\"<ref name=\"Lewis\"/> Wittgenstein said \"the house I built for Gretl is the product of a decidedly sensitive ear and ''good'' manners, and expression of great ''understanding''... But ''primordial'' life, wild life striving to erupt into the open \u2013 that is lacking.\"{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=240}} Monk comments that the same might be said of the technically excellent, but austere, terracotta sculpture Wittgenstein had modelled of Marguerite Respinger in 1926, and that, as Russell first noticed, this \"wild life striving to be in the open\" was precisely the substance of Wittgenstein's philosophical work.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=240}}\n\n==1929\u20131941: Fellowship at Cambridge==\n\n===PhD and fellowship===\n[[File:Ludwig Wittgenstein.jpg|thumb|Ludwig Wittgenstein, 1930]]\n\nAccording to Feigl (as reported by Monk), upon attending a conference in Vienna by mathematician [[L. E. J. Brouwer]], Wittgenstein remained quite impressed, taking into consideration the possibility of a \"return to Philosophy\". At the urging of Ramsey and others, Wittgenstein returned to Cambridge in 1929. Keynes wrote in a letter to his wife: \"Well, God has arrived. I met him on the 5.15 train.\"{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=255}} Despite this fame, he could not initially work at Cambridge as he did not have a degree, so he applied as an advanced undergraduate. Russell noted that his previous residency was sufficient to fulfil eligibility requirements for a PhD, and urged him to offer the ''Tractatus'' as his thesis.<ref>Alan Wood (1957). ''Bertrand Russell: The Passionate Sceptic.''

In 1938, he travelled to Ireland to visit [[Maurice O'Connor Drury]], a friend who became a psychiatrist, and considered such training himself, with the intention of abandoning philosophy for it. The visit to Ireland was at the same time a response to the invitation of the then Irish [[Taoiseach]], [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], himself a former mathematics teacher.

The Nuremberg Laws classified people as Jews (''Volljuden'') if they had three or four Jewish grandparents, and as mixed blood (''[[Mischling]]'') if they had one or two.

The Nazis discovered his relationship with Hilde Schania, a brewer's daughter with whom he had had two children but whom he had never married, though he did later. Because she was not Jewish, he was served with a summons for ''[[Rassenschande]]'' (racial defilement). He told no one he was leaving the country, except for Hilde who agreed to follow him.

Gretl, an American citizen by marriage, started the negotiations over the racial status of their grandfather, and the family's large foreign currency reserves were used as a bargaining tool. Paul had escaped to Switzerland and then the US in July 1938, and disagreed with the negotiations, leading to a permanent split between the siblings.

He had extreme difficulty in expressing himself and his words were unintelligible to me. I whispered to my neighbour, 'Who's that?': he replied, 'Wittgenstein'. I was astonished because I had expected the famous author of the ''Tractatus'' to be an elderly man, whereas this man looked ''young'' \u2013 perhaps about 35. (His actual age was 49.) His face was lean and brown, his profile was aquiline and strikingly beautiful, his head was covered with a curly mass of brown hair. I observed the respectful attention that everyone in the room paid to him. After this unsuccessful beginning he did not speak for a time but was obviously struggling with his thoughts. His look was concentrated, he made striking gestures with his hands as if he was discoursing... Whether lecturing or conversing privately, Wittgenstein always spoke emphatically and with a distinctive intonation. He spoke excellent English, with the accent of an educated Englishman, although occasional Germanisms would appear in his constructions. His voice was resonant... His words came out, not fluently, but with great force. Anyone who heard him say anything knew that this was a singular person. His face was remarkably mobile and expressive when he talked. His eyes were deep and often fierce in their expression. His whole personality was commanding, even imperial.\"<ref>Malcolm, pp. 23\u20134.</ref>}}\n\nDescribing Wittgenstein's lecture programme, Malcolm continues: {{quote|\"It is hardly correct to speak of these meetings as 'lectures', although this is what Wittgenstein called them. For one thing, he was carrying on original research in these meetings... Often the meetings consisted mainly of dialogue. Sometimes, however, when he was trying to draw a thought out of himself, he would prohibit, with a peremptory motion of the hand, any questions or remarks. There were frequent and prolonged periods of silence, with only an occasional mutter from Wittgenstein, and the stillest attention from the others. During these silences, Wittgenstein was extremely tense and active. His gaze was concentrated; his face was alive; his hands made arresting movements; his expression was stern. One knew that one was in the presence of extreme seriousness, absorption, and force of intellect... Wittgenstein was a frightening person at these classes.\"<ref>Malcolm, p. 25.</ref>}}\n\nAfter work, the philosopher would often relax by watching [[Western Movie|Westerns]], where he preferred to sit at the very front of the cinema, or reading detective stories especially the ones written by [[Norbert Davis]].{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=528}}<ref>{{cite web |last=Hoffmann |first=Josef |url=http://www.mysteryfile.com/NDavis/Wit.html |title=Hard-boiled Wit: Ludwig Wittgenstein and Norbert Davis |website=CADS |number=44 |date=October 2003 }}</ref> Norman Malcolm wrote that Wittgenstein would rush to the cinema when class ended.<ref>Malcolm, p. 26.</ref>\n\nBy this time, Wittgenstein's view on the [[foundations of mathematics]] had changed considerably. In his early 20s, Wittgenstein had thought logic could provide a solid foundation, and he had even considered updating Russell and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]]'s ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''. Now he denied there were any mathematical facts to be discovered. He gave a series of lectures on mathematics, discussing this and other topics, documented in a book, with lectures by Wittgenstein and discussions between him and several students, including the young [[Alan Turing]] who described Wittgenstein as \"a ''very'' peculiar man\".

He wrote on 1 April 1942: \"I no longer feel any hope for the future of my life. It is as though I had before me nothing more than a long stretch of living death. I cannot imagine any future for me other than a ghastly one. Friendless and joyless.\"{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=431}} It was at this time that Wittgenstein had an operation at Guy's to remove a gall-stone that had troubled him for some years.\n\nHe had developed a friendship with Keith Kirk, a working-class teenage friend of [[Francis Skinner]], the mathematics undergraduate he had had a relationship with until Skinner's death in 1941 from [[polio]]. Skinner had given up academia, thanks at least in part to Wittgenstein's influence, and had been working as a mechanic in 1939, with Kirk as his apprentice. Kirk and Wittgenstein struck up a friendship, with Wittgenstein giving him lessons in physics to help him pass a [[City and Guilds]] exam. During his period of loneliness at Guy's he wrote in his diary: \"For ten days I've heard nothing more from K, even though I pressed him a week ago for news. I think that he has perhaps broken with me. A ''tragic'' thought!\"{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=443}} Kirk had in fact got married, and they never saw one another again.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=442-423}}\n\nWhile Wittgenstein was at Guy's he met Basil Reeve, a young doctor with an interest in philosophy, who, with R. T. Grant, was studying the effect of shock on air-raid casualties. When the blitz ended there were fewer casualties to study. In November 1942, Grant and Reeve moved to the [[Royal Victoria Infirmary]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], to study road traffic and industrial casualties. Grant offered Wittgenstein a position as a laboratory assistant at a wage of \u00a34 per week, and he lived in Newcastle (at 28 Brandling Park, [[Jesmond]]<ref name=\"Schardt\">{{cite web |url=http://www.newphilsoc.org.uk/OldWeb1/Wittgenstein/wittgenstein_upon_tyne.htm |title=Wittgenstein Upon Tyne |first=Bill |last=Schardt |work=Newcastle Philosophical Society |accessdate=8 April 2020 }}</ref>) from 29 April 1943 until February 1944.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=447}}\n\nIn the summer of 1946, Wittgenstein thought often of leaving Cambridge and resigning his position as Chair. Wittgenstein grew further dismayed at the state of philosophy, particularly about articles published in the journal [[Mind (journal)|''Mind'']]. It was around this time that Wittgenstein fell in love with Ben Richards writing in his diary, \"The only thing that my love for B. has done for me is this: it has driven the other small worries associated with my position and my work into the background.\" On the 30th of September, Wittgenstein wrote about Cambridge after his return from Swansea, \"Everything about the place repels me. The stiffness, the artificiality, the self-satisfaction of the people. The university atmosphere nauseates me.\"{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=493}}\n\nWittgenstein had only maintained contact with Fouracre from Guy's hospital who had joined the army in 1943 after his marriage, only returning in 1947. Wittgenstein maintained frequent correspondence with Fouracre during his time away displaying a desire for Fouracre to return home urgently from the war.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=493}}\n\nIn May 1947, Wittgenstein addressed a group of Oxford philosophers for the first time at the Jowett Society. The discussion was on the validity of [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Descartes']] [[Cogito ergo sum]] where Wittgenstein ignored the question and applied his own philosophical method. [[Harold Arthur Prichard]] who attended the event was not pleased with Wittgenstein's methods;<blockquote>Wittgenstein: If a man says to me, looking at the sky, \u2018I think it will rain, therefore I exist,\u2019 I do not understand him.</blockquote><blockquote>Prichard: That\u2019s all very fine; what we want to know is: is the cogito valid or not?{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=496}}</blockquote>\n\n==1947\u20131951: Final years==\n{{rquote|left|Death is not an event in life: we do not live to experience death.

The details of Wittgenstein's stay in America are recounted in Norman Malcolm's ''Ludwig Wittgenstein: A Memoir''. During his summer in America, Wittgenstein began his epistemological discussions, in particular his engagement with [[philosophical scepticism]], that would eventually become the final fragments ''[[On Certainty]]''.\n[[File:Ludwig Wittgenstein Blue Plaque, 76 Storey's Way, Cambridge, UK.jpg|thumb|The plaque at \"Storey's End\", 76 [[Storey's Way]], Cambridge, where Wittgenstein died.]]\nHe returned to London, where he was diagnosed with an inoperable [[prostate cancer]], which had spread to his bone marrow. He spent the next two months in Vienna, where his sister Hermine died on 11 February 1950; he went to see her every day, but she was hardly able to speak or recognize him. \"Great loss for me and all of us,\" he wrote. \"Greater than I would have thought.\" He moved around a lot after Hermine's death staying with various friends: to Cambridge in April 1950, where he stayed with [[Georg Henrik von Wright|G.

He went to Norway in August with Ben Richards, then returned to Cambridge, where on 27 November he moved into ''Storey's End'' at 76 [[Storey's Way]], the home of his doctor, [[Edward Vaughan Bevan|Edward Bevan]], and his wife Joan; he had told them he did not want to die in a hospital, so they said he could spend his last days in their home instead.

It was his 62nd birthday on 26 April. He went for a walk the next afternoon, and wrote his last entry that day, 27 April. That evening, he became very ill; when his doctor told him he might live only a few days, he reportedly replied, \"Good!\" Joan stayed with him throughout that night, and just before losing consciousness for the last time on 28 April, he told her: \"Tell them I've had a wonderful life.\" Norman Malcolm describes this as a \"...strangely moving utterance.\"<ref name=Malcolm80/> {{rquote|right|''Tell them I've had a wonderful life.''|Wittgenstein, 1951}} \n\nFour of Wittgenstein's former students arrived at his bedside\u2014Ben Richards, [[Elizabeth Anscombe]], [[Yorick Smythies]], and [[Maurice O'Connor Drury]]. Anscombe and Smythies were Catholics; and, at the latter's request, a Dominican friar, Father [[Conrad Pepler]], also attended.

However, he did not consider himself to be a Catholic. According to [[Norman Malcolm]], Wittgenstein saw Catholicism as more of a way of life than as a set of beliefs he personally held, considering that he did not accept any religious faith.<ref>{{cite book|title=Ludwig Wittgenstein: A Memoir|authors=Norman Malcolm; G.

Those who did participate he respected \u2014 although here as elsewhere he had contempt for insincerity. I suspect that he regarded religious belief as based on qualities of character and will that he himself did not possess. Of Smythies and Anscombe, both of whom had become Roman Catholics, he once said to me: 'I could not possibly bring myself to believe all the things that they believe.'

Most of Part I was ready for printing in 1946, but Wittgenstein withdrew the manuscript from his publisher. The shorter Part II was added by his editors, [[Elizabeth Anscombe]] and [[Rush Rhees]]. Wittgenstein asks the reader to think of language as a multiplicity of language-games within which parts of language develop and function. He argues the bewitchments of philosophical problems arise from philosophers' misguided attempts to consider the meaning of words independently of their context, usage, and grammar, what he called \"language gone on holiday.\"<ref>''PI'', \u00a738.</ref>\n\nAccording to Wittgenstein, philosophical problems arise when language is forced from its proper home into a metaphysical environment, where all the familiar and necessary landmarks and contextual clues are removed. He describes this metaphysical environment as like being on frictionless ice: where the conditions are apparently perfect for a philosophically and logically perfect language, all philosophical problems can be solved without the muddying effects of everyday contexts; but where, precisely because of the lack of friction, language can in fact do no work at all.<ref>''PI'', \u00a7107.</ref> Wittgenstein argues that philosophers must leave the frictionless ice and return to the \"rough ground\" of ordinary language in use. Much of the ''Investigations'' consists of examples of how the first false steps can be avoided, so that philosophical problems are dissolved, rather than solved: \"the clarity we are aiming at is indeed ''complete'' clarity. But this simply means that the philosophical problems should ''completely'' disappear.\"<ref>''PI'', \u00a7133.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nWittgenstein left a voluminous archive of unpublished papers, including 83 manuscripts, 46 typescripts and 11 dictations, amounting to an estimated 20,000 pages.

Wittgenstein's three Literary executors prioritized it, both because of its intrinsic importance and because he had explicitly intended publication. The book was published in 1953.\n\nAt least three other works were more or less finished. Two were already \"bulky typescripts\", the ''Philosophical Remarks'' and ''Philosophical Grammar''.

In the words of his friend and colleague [[Georg Henrik von Wright]]: <blockquote>He was of the opinion... that his ideas were generally misunderstood and distorted even by those who professed to be his disciples. He doubted he would be better understood in the future. He once said he felt as though he was writing for people who would think in a different way, breathe a different air of life, from that of present-day men.<ref name=\"autogenerated6\"/></blockquote>\n\n===Interpreters===\nSince Wittgenstein's death, scholarly interpretations of his philosophy have differed. Scholars have differed on the continuity between \"early\" and \"late\" Wittgenstein (that is, the difference between his views expressed in the ''Tractatus'' and those in ''Philosophical Investigations''), with some seeing the two as starkly disparate and others stressing the gradual transition between the two works through analysis of Wittgenstein's unpublished papers (the ''[[Nachlass]]'').<ref name=\"Glock\">{{cite book|last1=Glock|first1=Hans-Johann|editor1-last=Kahane|editor1-first=Guy|editor2-last=Kanterian|editor2-first=Edward|editor3-last=Kuusela|editor3-first=Oskari|title=Wittgenstein and his interpreters: essays in memory of Gordon Baker|date=2007|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=9781405129220|pages=37\u201365|chapter=Perspectives on Wittgenstein: An Intermittently Opinionated Survey}}</ref>\n\nOne significant debate in Wittgenstein scholarship concerns the work of interpreters who are referred to under the banner of [[The New Wittgenstein]] school such as [[Cora Diamond]], [[Alice Crary]], and [[James F. Conant]].  While the ''Tractatus'', particularly in its conclusion, seems paradoxical and self-undermining, New Wittgenstein scholars advance a \"therapeutic\" understanding of Wittgenstein's work\u2014\"an understanding of Wittgenstein as aspiring, not to advance metaphysical theories, but rather to help us work ourselves out of confusions we become entangled in when philosophizing.\"{{sfn|Crary|2000|p=1}} To support this goal, the New Wittgenstein scholars propose a reading of the ''Tractatus'' as \"plain nonsense\"\u2014arguing it does not attempt to convey a substantive philosophical project but instead simply tries to push the reader to abandon philosophical speculation. The therapeutic approach traces its roots to the philosophical work of [[John Wisdom]]<ref>{{Cite book|first=John|last=Wisdom|title=Philosophy and Psycho-Analysis|publisher=Blackwell|date=1953}}</ref> and the review of ''The Blue Book'' written by [[Oets Kolk Bouwsma]].<ref name=\"Glock\" /><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bouwsma|first1=O.

Russell returned to Cambridge after a backlash in America to his writings on morals and religion. Wittgenstein said of Russell's works to Drury;<blockquote>Russell\u2019s books should be bound in two colours\u2026those dealing with mathematical logic in red \u2013 and all students of philosophy should read them; those dealing with ethics and politics in blue \u2013 and no one should be allowed to read them.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=471}}</blockquote>Russell made similar disparaging comments about Wittgenstein's later work;<blockquote>I have not found in Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations anything that seemed to me interesting and I do not understand why a whole school finds important wisdom in its pages. Psychologically this is surprising. The earlier Wittgenstein, whom I knew intimately, was a man addicted to passionately intense thinking, profoundly aware of difficult problems of which I, like him, felt the importance, and possessed (or at least so I thought) of true philosophical genius. The later Wittgenstein, on the contrary, seems to have grown tired of serious thinking and to have invented a doctrine which would make such an activity unnecessary. I do not for one moment believe that the doctrine which has these lazy consequences is true. I realize, however, that I have an overpoweringly strong bias against it, for, if it is true, philosophy is, at best, a slight help to lexicographers, and at worst, an idle tea-table amusement.<ref>{{Cite book|title=My Philosophical Development|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|publisher=Allen & Unwin|year=1959|isbn=978-0041920154|location=New York|pages=216\u2013217}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==== Saul Kripke ====\n[[Saul Kripke]]'s 1982 book ''[[Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language]]'' contends that the central argument of Wittgenstein's ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' is a devastating [[rule-following paradox]] that undermines the possibility of our ever following rules in our use of language.

Kripke's position has, however recently been defended against these and other attacks by the Cambridge philosopher [[Martin Kusch]] (2006). Wittgenstein scholar [[David G.

Whereas men are basically rational, women operate only at the level of their emotions and sexual organs. Jews, Weininger argued, are similar, saturated with femininity, with no sense of right and wrong, and no soul. Weininger argues that man must choose between his masculine and feminine sides, consciousness and unconsciousness, Platonic love and sexuality. Love and sexual desire stand in contradiction, and love between a woman and a man is therefore doomed to misery or immorality. The only life worth living is the spiritual one\u2014to live as a woman or a Jew means one has no right to live at all; the choice is genius or death. Weininger committed suicide, shooting himself in 1903, shortly after publishing the book.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=19-26}} Wittgenstein, then 14, attended Weininger's funeral.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GHJjAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA229 |page=229|title=Hitler's Vienna: A Dictator's Apprenticeship|isbn=9780195140538|last1=Hamann|first1=Brigitte|year=2000}}</ref> Many years later, as a professor at the [[University of Cambridge]], Wittgenstein distributed copies of Weininger's book to his bemused academic colleagues. He said that Weininger's arguments were wrong, but that it was the way they were wrong that was interesting.<ref>p216, Philosophical Tales, Cohen, M., Blackwell 2008</ref> In a letter dated 23 August 1931, Wittgenstein wrote the following to [[G. E. Moore]];<blockquote>Dear Moore,</blockquote><blockquote>Thanks for your letter. I can quite imagine that you don't admire Weininger very much, what with that beastly translation and the fact that W. must feel very foreign to you. It is true that he is fantastic but he is great and fantastic. It isn't necessary or rather not possible to agree with him but the greatness lies in that with which we disagree.

He attended for three semesters, and was awarded a [[diploma]] (''Abgangzeugnis'') on 5 May 1908.\n\nDuring his time at the Institute, Wittgenstein developed an interest in [[aeronautics]].{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=27}} He arrived at the [[Victoria University of Manchester]] in the spring of 1908 to study for a doctorate, full of plans for aeronautical projects, including designing and flying his own plane. He conducted research into the behavior of kites in the upper atmosphere, experimenting at a meteorological observation site near [[Glossop]].{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=29}} Specifically, the [[Royal Meteorological Society]] researched and investigated the ionization of the upper atmosphere, by suspending instruments on balloons or kites. At Glossop, Wittgenstein worked under Professor of Physics Sir [[Arthur Schuster]].<ref name=\"Lemco 39\u201351\">{{cite journal |last=Lemco |first=Ian |date=22 January 2007 |title=Wittgenstein's Aeronautical Investigation |journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=39\u201351 |doi=10.1098/rsnr.2006.0163 |jstor=20462605 }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nHe also worked on the design of a propeller with small jet engines on the end of its blades, something he patented in 1911, and which earned him a research studentship from the university in the autumn of 1908.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=30-35}} At the time, contemporary propeller designs were not advanced enough to actually put Wittgenstein's ideas into practice, and it would be years before a blade design that could support Wittgenstein's innovative design was created. Wittgenstein's design required air and gas to be forced along the propeller arms to combustion chambers on the end of each blade, where it was then compressed by the centrifugal force exerted by the revolving arms and ignited. Propellers of the time were typically wood, whereas modern blades are made from pressed steel laminates as separate halves, which are then welded together. This gives the blade a hollow interior, and therefore creates an ideal pathway for the air and gas.<ref name=\"Lemco 39\u201351\" />\n\n[[File:11.

Frege was a small, neat man with a pointed beard who bounced around the room as he talked. He absolutely wiped the floor with me, and I felt very depressed; but at the end he said 'You must come again', so I cheered up. I had several discussions with him after that.

The lectures were poorly attended and Russell often found himself lecturing only to [[C. D. Broad]], [[Eric Harold Neville|E. H. Neville]], and H. T. J. Norton.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=36}} Wittgenstein started following him after lectures back to his rooms to discuss more philosophy, until it was time for the evening meal in [[Formal (university)#Terminology|Hall]]. Russell grew irritated; he wrote to his lover [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]]: \"My German friend threatens to be an infliction.\"{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|pp=88-89}}\nRussell soon came to believe that Wittgenstein was a genius, especially after he had examined Wittgenstein's written work. He wrote in November 1911 that he had at first thought Wittgenstein might be a crank, but soon decided he was a genius: \"Some of his early views made the decision difficult. He maintained, for example, at one time that all existential propositions are meaningless. This was in a lecture room, and I invited him to consider the proposition: 'There is no hippopotamus in this room at present.' When he refused to believe this, I looked under all the desks without finding one; but he remained unconvinced.\"{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|p=88}} Three months after Wittgenstein's arrival Russell told Morrell: \"I love him & feel he will solve the problems I am too old to solve ... He is ''the'' young man one hopes for.\"{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=41}} Wittgenstein later told David Pinsent that Russell's encouragement had proven his salvation, and had ended nine years of loneliness and suffering, during which he had continually thought of suicide. In encouraging him to pursue philosophy and in justifying his inclination to abandon engineering, Russell had, quite literally, saved Wittgenstein's life.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=41}} The role-reversal between Bertrand Russell and Wittgenstein was soon such that Russell wrote in 1916, after Wittgenstein had criticized Russell's own work: \"His [Wittgenstein]'s criticism, tho' I don't think you realized it at the time, was an event of first-rate importance in my life, and affected everything I have done since.

B. Braithwaite|Richard Braithwaite]]'s rooms in [[King's College, Cambridge]], where [[Karl Popper]], another Viennese philosopher, had been invited as the guest speaker. Popper's paper was \"Are there philosophical problems?\", in which he struck up a position against Wittgenstein's, contending that problems in philosophy are real, not just linguistic puzzles as Wittgenstein argued. Accounts vary as to what happened next, but Wittgenstein apparently started waving a hot poker, demanding that Popper give him an example of a moral rule. Popper offered one\u2014\"Not to threaten visiting speakers with pokers\"\u2014at which point Russell told Wittgenstein he had misunderstood and Wittgenstein left. Popper maintained that Wittgenstein 'stormed out', but it had become accepted practice for him to leave early (because of his aforementioned ability to dominate discussion). It was the only time the philosophers, three of the most eminent in the world, were ever in the same room together.<ref>{{cite news |last=Eidinow |first=John |last2=Edmonds |first2=David |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/31/artsandhumanities.highereducation |title=When Ludwig met Karl... |newspaper=The Guardian |date=31 March 2001 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/nov/21/guardianfirstbookaward2001.gurardianfirstbookaward |title=Wittgenstein's Poker by David Edmonds and John Eidinow |newspaper=The Guardian |date=21 November 2001}}</ref> The minutes record that the meeting was \"charged to an unusual degree with a spirit of controversy.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/bennish/1889016855/#/photos/bennish/1889016855/lightbox/ |title=Minutes of the Wittgenstein's poker meeting |publisher=University of Cambridge |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629145957/http://www.flickr.com/photos/bennish/1889016855/#/photos/bennish/1889016855/lightbox/ |accessdate=7 September 2010 |archive-date=29 June 2011 |via=Flickr }}</ref>\n\n===Cambridge Apostles===\nThe famous economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] also invited him to join the [[Cambridge Apostles]], an elite secret society formed in 1820, which both Bertrand Russell and [[G. E. Moore]] had joined as students, but Wittgenstein did not greatly enjoy it and attended only infrequently. Russell had been worried that Wittgenstein would not appreciate the group's raucous style of intellectual debate, its precocious sense of humour, and the fact that the members were often in love with one another.{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|p=118}} He was admitted in 1912 but resigned almost immediately because he could not tolerate the style of discussion. Nevertheless, the Cambridge Apostles allowed Wittgenstein to participate in meetings again in the 1920s when he had returned to [[Cambridge]]. Reportedly, Wittgenstein also had trouble tolerating the discussions in the Cambridge Moral Sciences Club.\n\n=== Frustrations at Cambridge===\nWittgenstein was quite vocal about his depression in his years at Cambridge, and before he went to war; on many an occasion, he told Russell of his woes. His mental anguish seemed to stem from two sources: his work, and his personal life. Wittgenstein made numerous remarks to Russell about logic driving him mad.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=76}} Wittgenstein also stated to Russell that he \"felt the curse of those who have half a talent\".{{sfn|McGuinness|2008|p=39}} He later expresses this same worry, and tells of being in mediocre spirits due to his lack of progress in his logical work.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Wittgenstein in Cambridge|last=|first=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=59}}</ref> Monk writes that Wittgenstein lived and breathed logic, and a temporary lack of inspiration plunged him into despair.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=75}} Unless he was lying, Wittgenstein tells of his work in logic affecting his mental status in a very extreme way. However, he also tells Russell another story. Around Christmas, in 1913, he writes: \"how can I be a logician before I'm a human being? For the most important thing is coming to terms with myself!\"{{sfn|McGuinness|2008|p=63}} He also tells Russell on an occasion in Russell\u2019s rooms that he was worried about logic and his sins; also, once upon arrival to Russell's rooms one night Wittgenstein announced to Russell that he would kill himself once he left.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Portraits of Wittgenstein, Volume 1 |last=Flowers |first=F.A., III |last2=Ground |first2=Ian |date=22 October 2015 |isbn=9781472589781|location=|pages=151 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7VfiCgAAQBAJ }}</ref> Of things Wittgenstein personally told Russell, Ludwig\u2019s temperament was also recorded in the diary of [[David Pinsent]]. Pinsent writes \"I have to be frightfully careful and tolerant when he gets these sulky fits\", and \"I am afraid he is in an even more sensitive neurotic state just now than usual\", when talking about Wittgenstein's emotional fluctuations.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=85}}\n\n===Sexual orientation and relationship with David Pinsent===\n[[File:15.

Marguerite Respinger sits at the end of the left and the sculpture he made of her sits behind him on the mantel-place]]\nWittgenstein had romantic relations with both men and women. He is generally believed to have fallen in love with at least three men, and had a relationship with the latter two: [[David Pinsent|David Hume Pinsent]] in 1912, [[Francis Skinner]] in 1930, and Ben Richards in the late 1940s.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=583-586}} He later revealed that, as a teenager in Vienna, he had had an affair with a woman.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=369}} Additionally, in the 1920s Wittgenstein fell in love with a young Swiss woman, Marguerite Respinger, modelling a sculpture of her and proposing marriage, albeit on condition that they would not have children.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=238-240, 318}}\n\nWittgenstein's relationship with David Pinsent (1891\u20131918) occurred during an intellectually formative period, and is well documented. Bertrand Russell introduced Wittgenstein to Pinsent in the summer of 1912. A mathematics undergraduate and descendant of [[David Hume]], Pinsent soon became Wittgenstein's closest friend.<ref>Goldstein, Laurence. ''Clear and queer thinking: Wittgenstein's development and his relevance to modern thought''. Rowman & Littlefield, 1999, p. 179.</ref> The men worked together on experiments in the psychology laboratory about the role of rhythm in the appreciation of music, and Wittgenstein delivered a paper on the subject to the [[British Psychological Society|British Psychological Association]] in Cambridge in 1912. They also travelled together, including to Iceland in September 1912\u2014the expenses paid by Wittgenstein, including [[first class travel]], the hiring of a private train, and new clothes and spending money for Pinsent. In addition to Iceland, Wittgenstein and Pinsent traveled to Norway in 1913. Upon determining their destination, Wittgenstein and Pinsent visited a tourist office in search for a location that would fulfill the following criteria \u2013 small village located on a Fjord, a location away from tourists, and a peaceful destination to allow them to study logic and law.<ref>Portraits of Wittgenstein, Extracts from the Diary of David Pinsent 1912\u20131914, p. 221.</ref> Suggesting [[\u00d8ystese]], Wittgenstein and Pinsent arrived in the small village on 4 September 1913. With their vacation lasting almost three weeks, Wittgenstein was able to work vigorously on his studies. The immense progress on logic during their stay led Wittgenstein to express to Pinsent his idea to leave Cambridge and return to Norway to continue his work on logic.<ref>Portraits of Wittgenstein, Extracts from the Diary of David Pinsent 1912\u20131914, p.230.</ref> Pinsent's diaries provide valuable insights into Wittgenstein's personality \u2013 sensitive, nervous and attuned to the tiniest slight or change in mood from Pinsent.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=58ff}}<ref name=Wright/> Pinsent also writes of Wittgenstein being \"absolutely sulky and snappish\" at times, as well.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=85}} In his diaries Pinsent wrote about shopping for furniture with Wittgenstein in Cambridge when the latter was given rooms in Trinity; most of what they found in the stores was not minimalist enough for Wittgenstein's aesthetics: \"I went and helped him interview a lot of furniture at various shops ... It was rather amusing: he is terribly fastidious and we led the shopman a frightful dance, Vittgenstein [sic] ejaculating \"No\u2014Beastly!\" to 90 percent of what he shewed [archaic spelling] us!\"<ref name=\"Kanterian40\">Kanterian, p. 40.</ref>\n\nHe wrote in May 1912 that Wittgenstein had just begun to study the history of philosophy: \"He expresses the most naive surprise that all the philosophers he once worshipped in ignorance are after all stupid and dishonest and make disgusting mistakes!\"<ref name=Kanterian40/> The last time they saw each other was on 8 October 1913 at Lordswood House in Birmingham, then residence of the Pinsent family: \"I got up at 6.15 to see Ludwig off. He had to go very early \u2013 back to Cambridge \u2013 as he has lots to do there. I saw him off from the house in a taxi at 7:00 \u2013 to catch a 7:30 am train from New St Station.

Trakl requested to meet his benefactor but in 1914 when Wittgenstein went to visit, Trakl had killed himself.  Wittgenstein came to feel that he could not get to the heart of his most fundamental questions while surrounded by other academics, and so in 1913 he retreated to the village of [[Skjolden]] in Norway, where he rented the second floor of a house for the winter. He later saw this as one of the most productive periods of his life, writing ''Logik'' (''Notes on Logic''), the predecessor of much of the ''Tractatus''.<ref name=ConnorRobertson/> While in Norway, Wittgenstein learned [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] to converse with the local villagers, and [[Danish language|Danish]] to read the works of the Danish philosopher [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]].<ref>[[Jon Stewart (philosopher)|Stewart, Jon.]] (ed.) ''Kierkegaard's Influence on Philosophy: German and Scandinavian Philosophy''. Ashgate Publishing, 2009, p. 216.</ref>\n\nIt was during this time that Wittgenstein began addressing what he considered to be a central issue in ''Notes on Logic'', a general decision procedure for determining the truth value of logical propositions which would stem from a single primitive proposition. He became convinced during this time that \u201c[a]ll the propositions of logic are generalizations of tautologies and all generalizations of tautologies are generalizations of logic. There are no other logical propositions.\u201d{{sfn|McGuinness|2008|p=58}} Based on this, Wittgenstein argued that propositions of logic express their truth or falsehood in the sign itself, and one need not know anything about the constituent parts of the proposition to determine it true or false. Rather, one simply need identify the statement as a tautology (true), a contradiction (false), or neither.\n\nThe problem lay in forming a primitive proposition which encompassed this and would act as the basis for all of logic. As he stated in correspondence with Russell in late 1913, \u201cThe big question now is, how must a system of signs be constituted in order to make every tautology recognizable as such IN ONE AND THE SAME WAY? This is the fundamental problem of logic!\u201d {{sfn|McGuinness|2008|p=59}} The importance Wittgenstein placed upon this fundamental problem was so great that he believed if he did not solve it, he had no reason or right to live.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=96}} Despite this apparent life-or-death importance, Wittgenstein had given up on this primitive proposition by the time of the writing of the ''Tractatus''. The ''Tractatus'' does not offer any general process for identifying propositions as tautologies; in a simpler manner, \u201cEvery tautology itself shows that it is a tautology.\u201d<ref>Wittgenstein, Ludwig. ''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus: Side-By-Side-By-Side Edition''. Kegan Paul, 1922, p. 98.</ref> This shift to understanding tautologies through mere identification or recognition occurred in 1914 when Moore was called on by Wittgenstein to assist him in dictating his notes.\n\nAt Wittgenstein's insistence, Moore, who was now a Cambridge don, visited him in Norway in 1914, reluctantly because Wittgenstein exhausted him. [[David Edmonds (philosopher)|David Edmonds]] and John Eidinow write that Wittgenstein regarded Moore, an internationally known philosopher, as an example of how far someone could get in life with \"absolutely no intelligence whatever.\"{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=262}} In Norway it was clear that Moore was expected to act as Wittgenstein's secretary, taking down his notes, with Wittgenstein falling into a rage when Moore got something wrong.<ref name=Edmonds45/> When he returned to Cambridge, Moore asked the university to consider accepting ''Logik'' as sufficient for a bachelor's degree, but they refused, saying it wasn't formatted properly: no footnotes, no preface.

In 1914, it had been providing him with an income of 300,000 [[Austro-Hungarian krone|Kronen]] a year, but by 1919 was worth a great deal more, with a sizable portfolio of investments in the [[United States]] and the [[Netherlands]].

As a teacher, he wished to no longer be recognized as a member of the famous Wittgenstein family. In response, his brother Paul wrote: <blockquote>\"It is out of the question, really completely out of the question, that anybody bearing our name and whose elegant and gentle upbringing can be seen a thousand paces off, would not be identified as a member of our family...

Ramsey|Frank Ramsey]], a mathematics undergraduate at King's commissioned by [[C. K. Ogden]]. It was Moore who suggested ''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus'' for the title, an allusion to [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s ''Tractatus Theologico-Politicus.'' Initially there were difficulties in finding a publisher for the English edition too, because Wittgenstein was insisting it appear without Russell's introduction; Cambridge University Press turned it down for that reason. Finally in 1922 an agreement was reached with Wittgenstein that Kegan Paul would print a bilingual edition with Russell's introduction and the Ramsey-Ogden translation.<ref name=\"archive tractacus\"/> This is the translation that was approved by Wittgenstein, but it is problematic in a number of ways. Wittgenstein's English was poor at the time, and Ramsey was a teenager who had only recently learned German, so philosophers often prefer to use a 1961 translation by [[David Pears]] and Brian McGuinness.<ref>For example, Ramsey translated \"''Sachverhalt''\" and \"''Sachlage''\" as \"atomic fact\" and \"state of affairs\" respectively. But Wittgenstein discusses non-existent \"''Sachverhalten''\", and there cannot be a non-existent fact. Pears and McGuinness made a number of changes, including translating \"''Sachverhalt''\" as \"state of affairs\" and \"''Sachlage''\" as ''situation''. The new translation is often preferred, but some philosophers use the original, in part because Wittgenstein approved it, and because it avoids the idiomatic English of Pears-McGuinness.

While he was there, he wrote a 42-page pronunciation and spelling dictionary for the children, ''W\u00f6rterbuch f\u00fcr Volksschulen'', published in Vienna in 1926 by H\u00f6lder-Pichler-Tempsky, the only book of his apart from the ''Tractatus'' that was published in his lifetime.<ref name=\"archive tractacus\"/> A first edition sold in 2005 for \u00a375,000.<ref name=\"Ezard\">{{cite news |last=Ezard |first=John |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/feb/19/books.booksnews2 |title=Philosopher's rare 'other book' goes on sale |work=The Guardian |date=19 February 2005 }}</ref>\n\nAn incident occurred in April 1926 and became known as ''Der Vorfall Haidbauer'' (the Haidbauer incident). Josef Haidbauer was an 11-year-old pupil whose father had died and whose mother worked as a local maid. He was a slow learner, and one day Wittgenstein hit him two or three times on the head, causing him to collapse. Wittgenstein carried him to the headmaster's office, then quickly left the school, bumping into a parent, Herr Piribauer, on the way out. Piribauer had been sent for by the children when they saw Haidbauer collapse; Wittgenstein had previously pulled Piribauer's daughter, Hermine, so hard by the ears that her ears had bled.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=224, 232\u2013233}} Piribauer said that when he met Wittgenstein in the hall that day: \"I called him all the names under the sun. I told him he wasn't a teacher, he was an animal-trainer! And that I was going to fetch the police right away!\"{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=225}}\n\nPiribauer tried to have Wittgenstein arrested, but the village's police station was empty, and when he tried again the next day he was told Wittgenstein had disappeared. On 28 April 1926, Wittgenstein handed in his resignation to Wilhelm Kundt, a local school inspector, who tried to persuade him to stay; however, Wittgenstein was adamant that his days as a schoolteacher were over.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=225}} Proceedings were initiated in May, and the judge ordered a psychiatric report; in August 1926 a letter to Wittgenstein from a friend, Ludwig H\u00e4nsel, indicates that hearings were ongoing, but nothing is known about the case after that. Alexander Waugh writes that Wittgenstein's family and their money may have had a hand in covering things up. Waugh writes that Haidbauer died shortly afterwards of haemophilia; Monk says he died when he was 14 of [[leukaemia]].<ref>Waugh, p. 162.</ref>{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=232}}\n\nTen years later, in 1936, as part of a series of \"confessions\" he engaged in that year, Wittgenstein appeared without warning at the village saying he wanted to confess personally and ask for pardon from the children he had hit. He visited at least four of the children, including Hermine Piribauer, who apparently replied only with a \"Ja, ja,\" though other former students were more hospitable. Monk writes that the purpose of these confessions was not \"to hurt his pride, as a form of punishment; it was to dismantle it\u2014to remove a barrier, as it were, that stood in the way of honest and decent thought.\" Of the apologies, Wittgenstein wrote, \"This brought me into more settled waters... and to greater seriousness.\"{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=370-371}}\n\n===The Vienna Circle===\n{{See also|Vienna Circle}}\nThe ''Tractatus'' was now the subject of much debate amongst philosophers, and Wittgenstein was a figure of increasing international fame. In particular, a discussion group of philosophers, scientists and mathematicians, known as the [[Vienna Circle]], had built up purportedly as a result of the inspiration they had been given by reading the ''Tractatus''.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=212}} While it is commonly assumed that Wittgenstein was a part of the Vienna Circle, in reality, this was not actually the case. German philosopher [[Oswald Hanfling]] writes bluntly: \"Wittgenstein was never a member of the Circle, though he was in Vienna during much of the time. Yet his influence on the Circle's thought was at least as important as that of any of its members.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = Essential Readings in Logical Positivism|last = Hanfling|first = Oswald |author-link=Oswald Hanfling |publisher = Basil Blackwell|year = 1981|isbn = 978-0-631-12566-2|location = Oxford|pages = 3}}</ref> However, the philosopher [[A. C. Grayling]] contends that while certain superficial similarities between Wittgenstein's early philosophy and [[logical positivism]] led its members to study the ''Tractatus'' in detail and to arrange discussions with him, Wittgenstein's influence on the Circle was rather limited. The fundamental philosophical views of Circle had been established before they met Wittgenstein and had their origins in the [[Empiricism|British empiricists]], [[Ernst Mach]], and the logic of [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]] and Russell. Whatever influence Wittgenstein did have on the Circle was largely limited to [[Moritz Schlick]] and [[Friedrich Waismann]] and, even in these cases, resulted in little lasting effect on their positivism. Grayling states: \"...it is no longer possible to think of the ''Tractatus'' as having inspired a philosophical movement, as most earlier commentators claimed.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Wittgenstein : a very short introduction|last=Grayling, A.

However, during these discussions, it soon became evident that Wittgenstein held a different attitude towards philosophy than the members of the Circle. For example, during meetings of the Vienna Circle, he would express his disagreement with the group's misreading of his work by turning his back to them and reading poetry aloud.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2012/09/07/the-limits-of-science-and-scientists/|title=The Limits of Science\u2014and Scientists - The Crux|date=7 September 2012|accessdate=16 February 2018}}</ref>  In his autobiography, [[Rudolf Carnap]] describes Wittgenstein as the thinker who gave him the greatest inspiration. However, he also wrote that \"there was a striking difference between Wittgenstein's attitude toward philosophical problems and that of Schlick and myself. Our attitude toward philosophical problems was not very different from that which scientists have toward their problems.\" As for Wittgenstein:\n{{quote|His point of view and his attitude toward people and problems, even theoretical problems, were much more similar to those of a creative artist than to those of a scientist; one might almost say, similar to those of a religious prophet or a seer... When finally, sometimes after a prolonged arduous effort, his answers came forth, his statement stood before us like a newly created piece of art or a divine revelation ... the impression he made on us was as if insight came to him as through divine inspiration, so that we could not help feeling that any sober rational comment or analysis of it would be a profanation.<ref>Rudolf Carnap, ''Autobiography'', in P.A.

His sister, Margaret, invited him to help with the design of her new townhouse in Vienna's ''Kundmanngasse''. Wittgenstein, his friend [[Paul Engelmann]], and a team of architects developed a spare modernist house. In particular, Wittgenstein focused on the windows, doors, and radiators, demanding that every detail be exactly as he specified. When the house was nearly finished Wittgenstein had an entire ceiling raised 30mm so that the room had the exact proportions he wanted. Monk writes that \"This is not so marginal as it may at first appear, for it is precisely these details that lend what is otherwise a rather plain, even ugly house its distinctive beauty.\"<ref name=\"Jeffries\">{{cite news |last=Jeffries |first=Stuart |url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/politicsphilosophyandsociety/story/0,,627752,00.html |title=A dwelling for the gods |work=The Guardian |date=5 January 2002 }}</ref>\n\nIt took him a year to design the door handles and another to design the radiators. Each window was covered by a metal screen that weighed {{convert|150|kg}}, moved by a pulley Wittgenstein designed. Bernhard Leitner, author of ''The Architecture of Ludwig Wittgenstein'', said there is barely anything comparable in the history of interior design: \"It is as ingenious as it is expensive. A metal curtain that could be lowered into the floor.\"<ref name=Jeffries/>\n\nThe house was finished by December 1928 and the family gathered there at Christmas to celebrate its completion. Wittgenstein's sister Hermine wrote: \"Even though I admired the house very much....It seemed indeed to be much more a dwelling for the gods.\"<ref name=\"Lewis\"/> Wittgenstein said \"the house I built for Gretl is the product of a decidedly sensitive ear and ''good'' manners, and expression of great ''understanding''... But ''primordial'' life, wild life striving to erupt into the open \u2013 that is lacking.\"{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=240}} Monk comments that the same might be said of the technically excellent, but austere, terracotta sculpture Wittgenstein had modelled of Marguerite Respinger in 1926, and that, as Russell first noticed, this \"wild life striving to be in the open\" was precisely the substance of Wittgenstein's philosophical work.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=240}}\n\n==1929\u20131941: Fellowship at Cambridge==\n\n===PhD and fellowship===\n[[File:Ludwig Wittgenstein.jpg|thumb|Ludwig Wittgenstein, 1930]]\n\nAccording to Feigl (as reported by Monk), upon attending a conference in Vienna by mathematician [[L. E. J. Brouwer]], Wittgenstein remained quite impressed, taking into consideration the possibility of a \"return to Philosophy\". At the urging of Ramsey and others, Wittgenstein returned to Cambridge in 1929. Keynes wrote in a letter to his wife: \"Well, God has arrived. I met him on the 5.15 train.\"{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=255}} Despite this fame, he could not initially work at Cambridge as he did not have a degree, so he applied as an advanced undergraduate.

In 1938, he travelled to Ireland to visit [[Maurice O'Connor Drury]], a friend who became a psychiatrist, and considered such training himself, with the intention of abandoning philosophy for it. The visit to Ireland was at the same time a response to the invitation of the then Irish [[Taoiseach]], [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], himself a former mathematics teacher.

The Nuremberg Laws classified people as Jews (''Volljuden'') if they had three or four Jewish grandparents, and as mixed blood (''[[Mischling]]'') if they had one or two. It meant ''inter alia'' that the Wittgensteins were restricted in whom they could marry or have sex with, and where they could work.<ref name=Waugh137>Waugh, pp. 137ff, 204\u2013209.</ref>\n\nAfter the Anschluss, his brother Paul left almost immediately for England, and later the US. The Nazis discovered his relationship with Hilde Schania, a brewer's daughter with whom he had had two children but whom he had never married, though he did later. Because she was not Jewish, he was served with a summons for ''[[Rassenschande]]'' (racial defilement). He told no one he was leaving the country, except for Hilde who agreed to follow him. He left so suddenly and quietly that for a time people believed he was the fourth Wittgenstein brother to have committed suicide.<ref>Waugh, pp. 224\u2013226.</ref>\n\nWittgenstein began to investigate acquiring British or Irish citizenship with the help of Keynes, and apparently had to confess to his friends in England that he had earlier misrepresented himself to them as having just one Jewish grandparent, when in fact he had three.<ref name=McGuinnessStern/>\n\nA few days before the invasion of Poland, Hitler personally granted ''Mischling'' status to the Wittgenstein siblings. In 1939 there were 2,100 applications for this, and Hitler granted only 12.<ref>Edmonds, Eidinow 2001, pp. 98, 105.</ref> Anthony Gottlieb writes that the pretext was that their paternal grandfather had been the bastard son of a German prince, which allowed the Reichsbank to claim foreign currency, stocks and 1700&nbsp;kg of gold held in Switzerland by a Wittgenstein family trust. Gretl, an American citizen by marriage, started the negotiations over the racial status of their grandfather, and the family's large foreign currency reserves were used as a bargaining tool. Paul had escaped to Switzerland and then the US in July 1938, and disagreed with the negotiations, leading to a permanent split between the siblings. After the war, when Paul was performing in Vienna, he did not visit Hermine who was dying there, and he had no further contact with Ludwig or Gretl.<ref name=gottlieb/>\n\n===Professor of philosophy===\n[[File:46.

Moore resigned the chair in philosophy in 1939, Wittgenstein was elected, and acquired [[British subject|British citizenship]] soon afterwards. In July 1939 he travelled to Vienna to assist Gretl and his other sisters, visiting Berlin for one day to meet an official of the [[Reichsbank]]. After this, he travelled to New York to persuade Paul, whose agreement was required, to back the scheme. The required Befreiung was granted in August 1939.

He had extreme difficulty in expressing himself and his words were unintelligible to me. I whispered to my neighbour, 'Who's that?': he replied, 'Wittgenstein'. I was astonished because I had expected the famous author of the ''Tractatus'' to be an elderly man, whereas this man looked ''young'' \u2013 perhaps about 35. (His actual age was 49.) His face was lean and brown, his profile was aquiline and strikingly beautiful, his head was covered with a curly mass of brown hair. I observed the respectful attention that everyone in the room paid to him. After this unsuccessful beginning he did not speak for a time but was obviously struggling with his thoughts. His look was concentrated, he made striking gestures with his hands as if he was discoursing... Whether lecturing or conversing privately, Wittgenstein always spoke emphatically and with a distinctive intonation. He spoke excellent English, with the accent of an educated Englishman, although occasional Germanisms would appear in his constructions. His voice was resonant... His words came out, not fluently, but with great force. Anyone who heard him say anything knew that this was a singular person. His face was remarkably mobile and expressive when he talked. His eyes were deep and often fierce in their expression. His whole personality was commanding, even imperial.\"<ref>Malcolm, pp. 23\u20134.</ref>}}\n\nDescribing Wittgenstein's lecture programme, Malcolm continues: {{quote|\"It is hardly correct to speak of these meetings as 'lectures', although this is what Wittgenstein called them. For one thing, he was carrying on original research in these meetings... Often the meetings consisted mainly of dialogue. Sometimes, however, when he was trying to draw a thought out of himself, he would prohibit, with a peremptory motion of the hand, any questions or remarks. There were frequent and prolonged periods of silence, with only an occasional mutter from Wittgenstein, and the stillest attention from the others. During these silences, Wittgenstein was extremely tense and active. His gaze was concentrated; his face was alive; his hands made arresting movements; his expression was stern. One knew that one was in the presence of extreme seriousness, absorption, and force of intellect... Wittgenstein was a frightening person at these classes.\"<ref>Malcolm, p. 25.</ref>}}\n\nAfter work, the philosopher would often relax by watching [[Western Movie|Westerns]], where he preferred to sit at the very front of the cinema, or reading detective stories especially the ones written by [[Norbert Davis]].{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=528}}<ref>{{cite web |last=Hoffmann |first=Josef |url=http://www.mysteryfile.com/NDavis/Wit.html |title=Hard-boiled Wit: Ludwig Wittgenstein and Norbert Davis |website=CADS |number=44 |date=October 2003 }}</ref> Norman Malcolm wrote that Wittgenstein would rush to the cinema when class ended.<ref>Malcolm, p. 26.</ref>\n\nBy this time, Wittgenstein's view on the [[foundations of mathematics]] had changed considerably. In his early 20s, Wittgenstein had thought logic could provide a solid foundation, and he had even considered updating Russell and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]]'s ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''. Now he denied there were any mathematical facts to be discovered. He gave a series of lectures on mathematics, discussing this and other topics, documented in a book, with lectures by Wittgenstein and discussions between him and several students, including the young [[Alan Turing]] who described Wittgenstein as \"a ''very'' peculiar man\". The two had many discussions about the relationship between computational logic and everyday notions of truth.<ref>{{Cite book| title = Alan Turing: The Enigma |last = Hodges | first = Andrew | authorlink=Andrew Hodges | publisher = [[Vintage Books|Vintage]] |year = 2014|isbn = 978-1-784-70008-9|location = London|page = 194|title-link = Alan Turing: The Enigma }}</ref><ref>Diamond, Cora (ed.).

He grew angry when any of his students wanted to become professional philosophers.<ref>For his desire that his students not pursue philosophy, see Malcolm, p. 28</ref>\n\nIn September 1941, he asked [[John Ryle (professor)|John Ryle]], the brother of the philosopher [[Gilbert Ryle]], if he could get a manual job at [[Guy's Hospital]] in London. John Ryle was professor of medicine at Cambridge and had been involved in helping Guy's prepare for [[the Blitz]]. Wittgenstein told Ryle he would die slowly if left at Cambridge, and he would rather die quickly. He started working at Guy's shortly afterwards as a dispensary porter, delivering drugs from the pharmacy to the wards where he apparently advised the patients not to take them.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=431}}\n\nIn the new year of 1942, Ryle took Wittgenstein to his home in Sussex to meet his wife who had been adamant to meet him. Ryle's son recorded the weekend in his diary;<blockquote>Wink is awful strange \u2013 not a very good english [sic] speaker, keeps on saying \u2018I mean\u2019 and \u2018its \u201ctolerable\u201d\u2019 meaning intolerable.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=434}} </blockquote>The hospital staff were not told he was one of the world's most famous philosophers, though some of the medical staff did recognize him\u2014at least one had attended Moral Sciences Club meetings\u2014but they were discreet. \"Good God, don't tell anybody who I am!\" Wittgenstein begged one of them.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=432}} Some of them nevertheless called him Professor Wittgenstein, and he was allowed to dine with the doctors. He wrote on 1 April 1942: \"I no longer feel any hope for the future of my life. It is as though I had before me nothing more than a long stretch of living death. I cannot imagine any future for me other than a ghastly one. Friendless and joyless.\"{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=431}} It was at this time that Wittgenstein had an operation at Guy's to remove a gall-stone that had troubled him for some years.\n\nHe had developed a friendship with Keith Kirk, a working-class teenage friend of [[Francis Skinner]], the mathematics undergraduate he had had a relationship with until Skinner's death in 1941 from [[polio]]. Skinner had given up academia, thanks at least in part to Wittgenstein's influence, and had been working as a mechanic in 1939, with Kirk as his apprentice. Kirk and Wittgenstein struck up a friendship, with Wittgenstein giving him lessons in physics to help him pass a [[City and Guilds]] exam. During his period of loneliness at Guy's he wrote in his diary: \"For ten days I've heard nothing more from K, even though I pressed him a week ago for news. I think that he has perhaps broken with me. A ''tragic'' thought!\"{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=443}} Kirk had in fact got married, and they never saw one another again.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=442-423}}\n\nWhile Wittgenstein was at Guy's he met Basil Reeve, a young doctor with an interest in philosophy, who, with R. T. Grant, was studying the effect of shock on air-raid casualties. When the blitz ended there were fewer casualties to study. In November 1942, Grant and Reeve moved to the [[Royal Victoria Infirmary]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], to study road traffic and industrial casualties. Grant offered Wittgenstein a position as a laboratory assistant at a wage of \u00a34 per week, and he lived in Newcastle (at 28 Brandling Park, [[Jesmond]]<ref name=\"Schardt\">{{cite web |url=http://www.newphilsoc.org.uk/OldWeb1/Wittgenstein/wittgenstein_upon_tyne.htm |title=Wittgenstein Upon Tyne |first=Bill |last=Schardt |work=Newcastle Philosophical Society |accessdate=8 April 2020 }}</ref>) from 29 April 1943 until February 1944.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=447}}\n\nIn the summer of 1946, Wittgenstein thought often of leaving Cambridge and resigning his position as Chair. Wittgenstein grew further dismayed at the state of philosophy, particularly about articles published in the journal [[Mind (journal)|''Mind'']]. It was around this time that Wittgenstein fell in love with Ben Richards writing in his diary, \"The only thing that my love for B. has done for me is this: it has driven the other small worries associated with my position and my work into the background.\" On the 30th of September, Wittgenstein wrote about Cambridge after his return from Swansea, \"Everything about the place repels me. The stiffness, the artificiality, the self-satisfaction of the people. The university atmosphere nauseates me.\"{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=493}}\n\nWittgenstein had only maintained contact with Fouracre from Guy's hospital who had joined the army in 1943 after his marriage, only returning in 1947. Wittgenstein maintained frequent correspondence with Fouracre during his time away displaying a desire for Fouracre to return home urgently from the war.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=493}}\n\nIn May 1947, Wittgenstein addressed a group of Oxford philosophers for the first time at the Jowett Society. The discussion was on the validity of [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Descartes']] [[Cogito ergo sum]] where Wittgenstein ignored the question and applied his own philosophical method. [[Harold Arthur Prichard]] who attended the event was not pleased with Wittgenstein's methods;<blockquote>Wittgenstein: If a man says to me, looking at the sky, \u2018I think it will rain, therefore I exist,\u2019 I do not understand him.</blockquote><blockquote>Prichard: That\u2019s all very fine; what we want to know is: is the cogito valid or not?{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=496}}</blockquote>\n\n==1947\u20131951: Final years==\n{{rquote|left|Death is not an event in life: we do not live to experience death.

The details of Wittgenstein's stay in America are recounted in Norman Malcolm's ''Ludwig Wittgenstein: A Memoir''.

According to [[Norman Malcolm]], Wittgenstein saw Catholicism as more of a way of life than as a set of beliefs he personally held, considering that he did not accept any religious faith.<ref>{{cite book|title=Ludwig Wittgenstein: A Memoir|authors=Norman Malcolm; G.

But I think that there was in him, in some sense, the possibility of religion. I believe that he looked on religion as a 'form of life' (to use an expression from the Investigations) in which he did not participate, but with which he was sympathetic and which greatly interested him. Those who did participate he respected \u2014 although here as elsewhere he had contempt for insincerity. I suspect that he regarded religious belief as based on qualities of character and will that he himself did not possess. Of Smythies and Anscombe, both of whom had become Roman Catholics, he once said to me: 'I could not possibly bring myself to believe all the things that they believe.' I think that in this remark he was not disparaging their belief. It was rather an observation about his own capacity.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Wittgenstein's Religious Point of View|year=2006|publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]]|isbn=9780826490278|first=Tim |last=Labron|page=47|quote=Wittgenstein has no goal to either support or reject religion; his only interest is to keep discussions, whether religious or not, clear.}}</ref> {{rquote|left|''I won't say 'See you tomorrow' because that would be like predicting the future, and I'm pretty sure I can't do that.''|Wittgenstein, 1949<ref>Drury, ''Recollections'', p. 160; cf.

Most of Part I was ready for printing in 1946, but Wittgenstein withdrew the manuscript from his publisher. The shorter Part II was added by his editors, [[Elizabeth Anscombe]] and [[Rush Rhees]]. Wittgenstein asks the reader to think of language as a multiplicity of language-games within which parts of language develop and function. He argues the bewitchments of philosophical problems arise from philosophers' misguided attempts to consider the meaning of words independently of their context, usage, and grammar, what he called \"language gone on holiday.\"<ref>''PI'', \u00a738.</ref>\n\nAccording to Wittgenstein, philosophical problems arise when language is forced from its proper home into a metaphysical environment, where all the familiar and necessary landmarks and contextual clues are removed. He describes this metaphysical environment as like being on frictionless ice: where the conditions are apparently perfect for a philosophically and logically perfect language, all philosophical problems can be solved without the muddying effects of everyday contexts; but where, precisely because of the lack of friction, language can in fact do no work at all.<ref>''PI'', \u00a7107.</ref> Wittgenstein argues that philosophers must leave the frictionless ice and return to the \"rough ground\" of ordinary language in use. Much of the ''Investigations'' consists of examples of how the first false steps can be avoided, so that philosophical problems are dissolved, rather than solved: \"the clarity we are aiming at is indeed ''complete'' clarity. But this simply means that the philosophical problems should ''completely'' disappear.\"<ref>''PI'', \u00a7133.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nWittgenstein left a voluminous archive of unpublished papers, including 83 manuscripts, 46 typescripts and 11 dictations, amounting to an estimated 20,000 pages. Choosing among repeated drafts, revisions, corrections and loose notes editorial work has found nearly one third of the total suitable for print.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.academia.edu/1854436/The_Bergen_Electronic_Edition_of_Wittgenstein_s_Nachlass |last=Stern |first=David |title=The Bergen Electronic Edition of Wittgenstein's Nachlass |journal=[[European Journal of Philosophy]] |volume=18 |issue=3 |date=September 2010 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0378.2010.00425.x }}</ref> An Internet facility hosted by the [[University of Bergen]] allows access to images of almost all the material and to search the available transcriptions.<ref>The Wittgenstein Archives at the University of Bergen [http://wab.uib.no/wab_nachlass.page/ (WAB)]</ref> In 2011 two new boxes of Wittgenstein papers were found.<ref>{{cite press release |publisher=Cambridge University |url=https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/unpublished-wittgenstein-archive-explored |date=28 April 2011 |title=Unpublished Wittgenstein Archive explored }}</ref>\n\n=== Posthumous publications ===\nWhat became the ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' was already close to completion in 1951. Wittgenstein's three Literary executors prioritized it, both because of its intrinsic importance and because he had explicitly intended publication. The book was published in 1953.\n\nAt least three other works were more or less finished. Two were already \"bulky typescripts\", the ''Philosophical Remarks'' and ''Philosophical Grammar''. Literary (co-)executor G. H. von Wright revealed \"They are virtually completed works. But Wittgenstein did not publish them.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Malcolm|first=Norman|title=Ludwig Wittgenstein ''A Memoir'' (2nd ed)|url=https://archive.org/details/ludwigwittgenste00malcrich|url-access=registration|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford Univ Press|date=1984|isbn=978-0-19-924759-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/ludwigwittgenste00malcrich/page/12 12]}}</ref> The third was ''Remarks on Colour''. \"He wrote ''[[inter alia|i.a.]]'' a fair amount on colour concepts, and this material he did excerpt and polish, reducing it to a small compass.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Wittgenstein|first=Ludwig|title=On Certainty|location=New York|publisher=Harper and Row|year=1969|isbn=978-0-06-131686-9|page=vie|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/oncertainty00witt}}</ref>\n\n=== Assessment ===\nIn 1999 a survey among American university and college teachers ranked the ''Investigations'' as the most important book of 20th-century philosophy, standing out as \"the one crossover masterpiece in twentieth-century philosophy, appealing across diverse specializations and philosophical orientations.\"<ref name=lackey/><ref name=lindenbranch/> The ''Investigations'' also ranked 54th on a list of most influential twentieth-century works in cognitive science prepared by the [[University of Minnesota]]'s Center for Cognitive Sciences.<ref name=\"milproj\"/>\n\n[[Peter Hacker]] argues that Wittgenstein's influence on 20th-century analytical philosophy can be attributed to his early influence on the [[Vienna Circle]] and later influence on the Oxford [[Ordinary language philosophy|\"ordinary language\" school]] and Cambridge philosophers.<ref name=hacker>{{cite web|title=Peter Hacker|url=http://philosophynow.org/issues/58/Peter_Hacker|website=Philosophy Now|accessdate=17 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nWittgenstein's influence has been felt in nearly every field of the humanities and social sciences, yet there are diverging interpretations of his thought. In the words of his friend and colleague [[Georg Henrik von Wright]]: <blockquote>He was of the opinion... that his ideas were generally misunderstood and distorted even by those who professed to be his disciples. He doubted he would be better understood in the future. He once said he felt as though he was writing for people who would think in a different way, breathe a different air of life, from that of present-day men.<ref name=\"autogenerated6\"/></blockquote>\n\n===Interpreters===\nSince Wittgenstein's death, scholarly interpretations of his philosophy have differed. Scholars have differed on the continuity between \"early\" and \"late\" Wittgenstein (that is, the difference between his views expressed in the ''Tractatus'' and those in ''Philosophical Investigations''), with some seeing the two as starkly disparate and others stressing the gradual transition between the two works through analysis of Wittgenstein's unpublished papers (the ''[[Nachlass]]'').<ref name=\"Glock\">{{cite book|last1=Glock|first1=Hans-Johann|editor1-last=Kahane|editor1-first=Guy|editor2-last=Kanterian|editor2-first=Edward|editor3-last=Kuusela|editor3-first=Oskari|title=Wittgenstein and his interpreters: essays in memory of Gordon Baker|date=2007|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=9781405129220|pages=37\u201365|chapter=Perspectives on Wittgenstein: An Intermittently Opinionated Survey}}</ref>\n\nOne significant debate in Wittgenstein scholarship concerns the work of interpreters who are referred to under the banner of [[The New Wittgenstein]] school such as [[Cora Diamond]], [[Alice Crary]], and [[James F. Conant]].  While the ''Tractatus'', particularly in its conclusion, seems paradoxical and self-undermining, New Wittgenstein scholars advance a \"therapeutic\" understanding of Wittgenstein's work\u2014\"an understanding of Wittgenstein as aspiring, not to advance metaphysical theories, but rather to help us work ourselves out of confusions we become entangled in when philosophizing.\"{{sfn|Crary|2000|p=1}} To support this goal, the New Wittgenstein scholars propose a reading of the ''Tractatus'' as \"plain nonsense\"\u2014arguing it does not attempt to convey a substantive philosophical project but instead simply tries to push the reader to abandon philosophical speculation. The therapeutic approach traces its roots to the philosophical work of [[John Wisdom]]<ref>{{Cite book|first=John|last=Wisdom|title=Philosophy and Psycho-Analysis|publisher=Blackwell|date=1953}}</ref> and the review of ''The Blue Book'' written by [[Oets Kolk Bouwsma]].<ref name=\"Glock\" /><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bouwsma|first1=O.

Russell returned to Cambridge after a backlash in America to his writings on morals and religion. Wittgenstein said of Russell's works to Drury;<blockquote>Russell\u2019s books should be bound in two colours\u2026those dealing with mathematical logic in red \u2013 and all students of philosophy should read them; those dealing with ethics and politics in blue \u2013 and no one should be allowed to read them.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=471}}</blockquote>Russell made similar disparaging comments about Wittgenstein's later work;<blockquote>I have not found in Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations anything that seemed to me interesting and I do not understand why a whole school finds important wisdom in its pages. Psychologically this is surprising. The earlier Wittgenstein, whom I knew intimately, was a man addicted to passionately intense thinking, profoundly aware of difficult problems of which I, like him, felt the importance, and possessed (or at least so I thought) of true philosophical genius. The later Wittgenstein, on the contrary, seems to have grown tired of serious thinking and to have invented a doctrine which would make such an activity unnecessary. I do not for one moment believe that the doctrine which has these lazy consequences is true. I realize, however, that I have an overpoweringly strong bias against it, for, if it is true, philosophy is, at best, a slight help to lexicographers, and at worst, an idle tea-table amusement.<ref>{{Cite book|title=My Philosophical Development|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|publisher=Allen & Unwin|year=1959|isbn=978-0041920154|location=New York|pages=216\u2013217}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==== Saul Kripke ====\n[[Saul Kripke]]'s 1982 book ''[[Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language]]'' contends that the central argument of Wittgenstein's ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' is a devastating [[rule-following paradox]] that undermines the possibility of our ever following rules in our use of language.

Kripke's position has, however recently been defended against these and other attacks by the Cambridge philosopher [[Martin Kusch]] (2006). Wittgenstein scholar [[David G. Stern]] considers the book to be \"the most influential and widely discussed\" work on Wittgenstein since the 1980s.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sN6JdZ-dTUEC&pg=PA2 |last=Stern |first=David G. |title=Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations: An Introduction |date=21 October 2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=2 |isbn=9780521891325 }}</ref>\n\n==Works==\n{{Refbegin|20em}}\nA collection of Ludwig Wittgenstein's manuscripts is held by Trinity College, Cambridge.\n* ''Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung'', Annalen der Naturphilosophie, 14 (1921)\n** ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' [''TLP''], translated by C.K.

He raised the $500 to pay the lease by pawning his wife's [[engagement ring]]. Barney's Clothes were stocked with 40 brand name suits and a big sign with a slogan, \"No Bunk, No Junk, No Imitations\". Barney's sold clothing at discounted prices by purchasing showroom samples, retail overstocks, and manufacturers' closeouts at auctions and bankruptcy sales. He also offered free alterations and free parking to attract customers. And this first of its kind store landed Barney Pressman on many TV and Radio shows.\n\nPressman claimed to be the first Manhattan retailer to use radio and television, beginning with \"Calling All Men to Barney's\" radio spots in the 1930s that parodied the introduction of the [[Dick Tracy]] show. He sponsored radio programs featuring Irish tenors and bands playing jigs to advertise Irish [[wool]]ens. Women encased in barrels gave away matchbooks with the store name and address. He also chartered a boat to take 2,000 of his customers from Manhattan to [[Coney Island]].\n\nIn a 1973 interview with ''[[Business Week]]'', [[Fred Pressman]], Barney Pressman's son, stated that he became \"convinced that the discount route definitely was not for us. My father and I have always hated cheap goods ... I didn't want to sell low-end merchandise. Now, many of those who chose to are verging on bankruptcy.\" Fred Pressman's obituary in ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated:\n\n<blockquote>With his father's blessing, Fred Pressman slowly transformed the store from a salty discount house that sold roast beef sandwiches in its pub to a purveyor of Italian designers with a cafe serving Perrier and light salads. He began to discard the types of suits that his father was prone to unearthing at auctions and bankruptcy sales, peppering the racks instead with then-obscure and top-name designers both, but continued to offer touches like free alterations that gave Barneys its reputation.</blockquote>\n\nPressman is quoted as saying, \"The best value you can offer a customer is personal attention to every detail, and they will return again and again. Ultimately, the customer cares the most about how he or she is treated.\" Pressman died in July 1996.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite news |title=Barney's Fred Pressman, 73 |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1996-07-15/news/9607140212_1_barney-pressman-fred-pressman-barneys-new-york |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=4 March 2011<!--present in achive.org-->}}</ref>\n\nIn 1970, Barney's built a fifth story onto its original building and a five-story addition. The original store was renamed America House and the addition was named International House. The expanded store occupied the entire Seventh Avenue block (between 16th and 17th streets), with {{convert|100000|sqft|m2}} of selling space and 20 individual shops.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nInternational House, Fred Pressman promised, would feature complete collections of European designers, \"from denim pants to $250 suits\", not just a watered-down \"potpourri of fabrics and models\". The renovated America House, he said, would hold merchandise from \"manufacturers who are in effect designers\".\n\nBy 1973, the store was stocking 60,000 suits. It carried the full lines of designers such as [[Bill Blass]], [[Pierre Cardin]], [[Christian Dior]], and [[Hubert de Givenchy]]. It became the first clothing store in the U.S. to stock the full line of [[Giorgio Armani]], after signing an agreement in 1976. Barneys is widely credited to have introduced Giorgio Armani to the American market.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWomen's clothing was introduced in 1976 on the third floor of the International House. In the following year, the women's store relocated to The Penthouse, a new top-level enclosure. Barney's also added housewares, cosmetics, and gift departments to the store. Also in 1977, Barney's in-store restaurant was renamed The Cafe and began selling salads, soup and sandwiches.\n\nThe company dropped the apostrophe in Barney's in 1981. In 1981, the women's penthouse became a duplex. Barneys imported 80% of the women's and 40% of the men's merchandise. The $25 million, {{convert|70000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} women's store finally opened in 1986 in a row of six townhouses and two larger adjacent buildings across the store along 17th Street. The addition included a unisex beauty salon and restaurant, antiques, and accessories, gifts, and housewares departments. It accounted for about one-third of Barneys' sales of some $90 million the following year.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn 1988, Barneys opened a {{convert|10000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} men's store in the [[Brookfield Place (New York City)|World Financial Center]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} The store abandoned its Seventh Avenue flagship in 1993, moving to the current {{convert|230000|sqft|m2|adj=on}}, nine-story, [[Kohn Pederson Fox]]-designed Manhattan store on [[Madison Avenue]] at East 61st Street. It was the largest new store in New York City since the [[Great Depression]]. The store is a 22-story building with 14 floors of offices above the store. The wood floors, a marble mosaic on the lobby floor, gold-leaf ceilings, and lacquered walls of the new Barneys store cost $267 million.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nIn 1989, the store formed a holding company with Japanese department store [[Isetan]] to operate stores in both countries.

At the conclusion of this consolidation, the real estate investment and the retail businesses would be held in one company.\n\nDuring the consolidation effort, Isetan's final funding of the real estate investment was intended to be processed through a Pressman family holding company, PREEN ('''P'''ressman '''R'''obert '''E'''ugene '''E'''lizabeth '''N'''ancy) and then directed to the real estate development.  Instead of the funds flowing directly through the holding company to the real estate investment, they were given in exchange to BNY Licensing (another Pressman family company that held the Barneys trademarks) for the projected 50 year royalty stream due BNY Licensing from Isetan for their Barneys Japan business. Isetan was unaware of this transaction at the time.\n\nIsetan had reported their investment in Barneys earlier in the year as a current asset expressing their intent and belief that it would be concluded in 1995/first quarter 1996. Isetan considered the handling of the final investment a breach in trust, and stopped efforts to consolidate the investment and the Pressman family business.\n\nIn December 1995, under the advice of John P. Campo of LeBeouf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae and Anthony Grillo of The Blackstone Group, the Pressmans recognizing that consolidating the investment and the business was no longer viable, voluntarily filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. It was believed that, only in bankruptcy court, could the agreement between the Pressman family and Isetan be dismissed and a new agreement be authored. The strategy failed.\n\nThe company filed for [[Chapter 11 Bankruptcy]] in early January 1996. The bankruptcy allowed the company to close stores that were opened early in the company's expansion and were no longer consistent with the company's strategy. These stores included stores in Cleveland, Ohio; Costa Mesa, California; Dallas and Houston, Texas; and Short Hills, New Jersey. In subsequent years, management would re-enter some of these markets with larger flagship stores.\n\n===2000 to 2018===\nOn December 20, 2004, the Pressman family sold its remaining ownership, less than 2%, to the [[Jones Apparel Group]], which in turn sold the company in September 2007 to [[Dubai]]-based [[private equity]] firm Istithmar PJSC for $937.4 million.<ref>{{cite news |title=Jones Apparel Group buys Barneys for $400 million |url=https://www.jckonline.com/editorial-article/jones-apparel-group-buys-barneys-for-400-million/ |date=15 November 2004 |magazine=JCK}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Jones Sells Barneys to Dubai Firm |url=https://www.thestreet.com/story/10364441/1/jones-sells-barneys-to-dubai-firm.html |journal=[[TheStreet.com]] |date=June 22, 2007 |accessdate=January 11, 2019}}</ref> Included in Istithmar's purchase was an estimated $500 million in debt. \"The luxury market took a sharp turn for the worse after Istithmar's acquisition of Barneys.

He raised the $500 to pay the lease by pawning his wife's [[engagement ring]]. Barney's Clothes were stocked with 40 brand name suits and a big sign with a slogan, \"No Bunk, No Junk, No Imitations\". Barney's sold clothing at discounted prices by purchasing showroom samples, retail overstocks, and manufacturers' closeouts at auctions and bankruptcy sales. He also offered free alterations and free parking to attract customers. And this first of its kind store landed Barney Pressman on many TV and Radio shows.\n\nPressman claimed to be the first Manhattan retailer to use radio and television, beginning with \"Calling All Men to Barney's\" radio spots in the 1930s that parodied the introduction of the [[Dick Tracy]] show. He sponsored radio programs featuring Irish tenors and bands playing jigs to advertise Irish [[wool]]ens. Women encased in barrels gave away matchbooks with the store name and address. He also chartered a boat to take 2,000 of his customers from Manhattan to [[Coney Island]].\n\nIn a 1973 interview with ''[[Business Week]]'', [[Fred Pressman]], Barney Pressman's son, stated that he became \"convinced that the discount route definitely was not for us. My father and I have always hated cheap goods ... I didn't want to sell low-end merchandise. Now, many of those who chose to are verging on bankruptcy.\" Fred Pressman's obituary in ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated:\n\n<blockquote>With his father's blessing, Fred Pressman slowly transformed the store from a salty discount house that sold roast beef sandwiches in its pub to a purveyor of Italian designers with a cafe serving Perrier and light salads. He began to discard the types of suits that his father was prone to unearthing at auctions and bankruptcy sales, peppering the racks instead with then-obscure and top-name designers both, but continued to offer touches like free alterations that gave Barneys its reputation.</blockquote>\n\nPressman is quoted as saying, \"The best value you can offer a customer is personal attention to every detail, and they will return again and again. Ultimately, the customer cares the most about how he or she is treated.\" Pressman died in July 1996.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite news |title=Barney's Fred Pressman, 73 |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1996-07-15/news/9607140212_1_barney-pressman-fred-pressman-barneys-new-york |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=4 March 2011<!--present in achive.org-->}}</ref>\n\nIn 1970, Barney's built a fifth story onto its original building and a five-story addition. The original store was renamed America House and the addition was named International House. The expanded store occupied the entire Seventh Avenue block (between 16th and 17th streets), with {{convert|100000|sqft|m2}} of selling space and 20 individual shops.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nInternational House, Fred Pressman promised, would feature complete collections of European designers, \"from denim pants to $250 suits\", not just a watered-down \"potpourri of fabrics and models\". The renovated America House, he said, would hold merchandise from \"manufacturers who are in effect designers\".\n\nBy 1973, the store was stocking 60,000 suits. It carried the full lines of designers such as [[Bill Blass]], [[Pierre Cardin]], [[Christian Dior]], and [[Hubert de Givenchy]]. It became the first clothing store in the U.S. to stock the full line of [[Giorgio Armani]], after signing an agreement in 1976. Barneys is widely credited to have introduced Giorgio Armani to the American market.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWomen's clothing was introduced in 1976 on the third floor of the International House. In the following year, the women's store relocated to The Penthouse, a new top-level enclosure. Barney's also added housewares, cosmetics, and gift departments to the store. Also in 1977, Barney's in-store restaurant was renamed The Cafe and began selling salads, soup and sandwiches.\n\nThe company dropped the apostrophe in Barney's in 1981. In 1981, the women's penthouse became a duplex. Barneys imported 80% of the women's and 40% of the men's merchandise. The $25 million, {{convert|70000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} women's store finally opened in 1986 in a row of six townhouses and two larger adjacent buildings across the store along 17th Street. The addition included a unisex beauty salon and restaurant, antiques, and accessories, gifts, and housewares departments. It accounted for about one-third of Barneys' sales of some $90 million the following year.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn 1988, Barneys opened a {{convert|10000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} men's store in the [[Brookfield Place (New York City)|World Financial Center]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} The store abandoned its Seventh Avenue flagship in 1993, moving to the current {{convert|230000|sqft|m2|adj=on}}, nine-story, [[Kohn Pederson Fox]]-designed Manhattan store on [[Madison Avenue]] at East 61st Street. It was the largest new store in New York City since the [[Great Depression]]. The store is a 22-story building with 14 floors of offices above the store.

At the conclusion of this consolidation, the real estate investment and the retail businesses would be held in one company.\n\nDuring the consolidation effort, Isetan's final funding of the real estate investment was intended to be processed through a Pressman family holding company, PREEN ('''P'''ressman '''R'''obert '''E'''ugene '''E'''lizabeth '''N'''ancy) and then directed to the real estate development.  Instead of the funds flowing directly through the holding company to the real estate investment, they were given in exchange to BNY Licensing (another Pressman family company that held the Barneys trademarks) for the projected 50 year royalty stream due BNY Licensing from Isetan for their Barneys Japan business. Isetan was unaware of this transaction at the time.\n\nIsetan had reported their investment in Barneys earlier in the year as a current asset expressing their intent and belief that it would be concluded in 1995/first quarter 1996. Isetan considered the handling of the final investment a breach in trust, and stopped efforts to consolidate the investment and the Pressman family business.\n\nIn December 1995, under the advice of John P. Campo of LeBeouf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae and Anthony Grillo of The Blackstone Group, the Pressmans recognizing that consolidating the investment and the business was no longer viable, voluntarily filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. It was believed that, only in bankruptcy court, could the agreement between the Pressman family and Isetan be dismissed and a new agreement be authored. The strategy failed.\n\nThe company filed for [[Chapter 11 Bankruptcy]] in early January 1996. The bankruptcy allowed the company to close stores that were opened early in the company's expansion and were no longer consistent with the company's strategy. These stores included stores in Cleveland, Ohio; Costa Mesa, California; Dallas and Houston, Texas; and Short Hills, New Jersey. In subsequent years, management would re-enter some of these markets with larger flagship stores.\n\n===2000 to 2018===\nOn December 20, 2004, the Pressman family sold its remaining ownership, less than 2%, to the [[Jones Apparel Group]], which in turn sold the company in September 2007 to [[Dubai]]-based [[private equity]] firm Istithmar PJSC for $937.4 million.<ref>{{cite news |title=Jones Apparel Group buys Barneys for $400 million |url=https://www.jckonline.com/editorial-article/jones-apparel-group-buys-barneys-for-400-million/ |date=15 November 2004 |magazine=JCK}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Jones Sells Barneys to Dubai Firm |url=https://www.thestreet.com/story/10364441/1/jones-sells-barneys-to-dubai-firm.html |journal=[[TheStreet.com]] |date=June 22, 2007 |accessdate=January 11, 2019}}</ref> Included in Istithmar's purchase was an estimated $500 million in debt. \"The luxury market took a sharp turn for the worse after Istithmar's acquisition of Barneys.
