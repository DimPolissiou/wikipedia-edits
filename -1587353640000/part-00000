At the top of the hill is a [[causewayed enclosure]], a form of [[Neolithic]] earthwork which began to appear in England from about 3700 BC, characterized by the full or partial enclosure of an area with ditches that are interrupted by gaps, or causeways.  It is not known what they were used for; they may have been settlements, or meeting places, or ritual sites of some kind.  Knap Hill is notable for having been the first causewayed enclosure to be excavated and identified, and has been scheduled as an [[ancient monument]].\n\n[[Ben Cunnington (archaeologist)|Benjamin]] and [[Maud Cunnington]] spent two summers investigating the site, in 1908 and 1909, and Maud published two reports of their work, noting that there were several gaps in the ditch and bank surrounding the enclosure.  In the late 1920s, after the excavation of [[Windmill Hill, Avebury|Windmill Hill]] among other sites, it became apparent that causewayed enclosures were a characteristic monument of the Neolithic period.  At first they were thought to have been inhabited, and so were called \"causewayed camps\", but that name has fallen out of use.  About seventy causewayed enclosures have now been found in Britain, and about a thousand in all in Europe.  The site was excavated again in 1961 by [[Graham Connah]], who kept thorough stratigraphic documentation. In 2011 the Gathering Time project published an analysis of [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dates]] from almost forty British causewayed enclosures, including several new dates from Connah's finds.  The conclusion was that there was a 91% chance that Knap Hill was constructed between 3530 and 3375 BC, and a 92% chance that the ditch had silted up at some time between 3525 and 3220 BC.\n\nTwo barrows lay within the Neolithic enclosure, and at least one more outside it.  The hilltop also contains the remains of a Romano-British settlement on an adjoining smaller area called the plateau enclosure, along with some evidence of occupation in the 17th century. An [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] sword was found in the smaller enclosure, and there is evidence of an intense fire in the same area, which may imply a violent end to the Romano-British occupation of the hilltop.\n\nKnap lies between Golden Ball Hill, to the east, and Walker Hill, to the west.  Two other Neolithic sites are nearby: [[Adam's Grave]], a chambered [[long barrow]] on Walker Hill, less than a mile (1.6 km) away, and [[Rybury]], another causewayed enclosure, {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} beyond Adam's Grave.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Knap Hill area from OS map 1961.png|thumb|upright=3|Area around Knap Hill in Wiltshire]]\nThe main archaeological site at Knap Hill is a [[causewayed enclosure]],<ref>Oswald et al.

(2001), p. 3.</ref>  (Both the causewayed enclosure and the hill itself are referred to as Knap Hill.)  Causewayed enclosures are areas that are fully or partially enclosed by segmented ditches (that is, ditches interrupted by gaps, or causeways, of unexcavated ground), often with earthworks and palisades in some combination.<ref name=\":3\" />  The use to which these enclosures were put has long been a matter of debate, and many suggestions have been made by researchers.  They may have seen use as settlements\u2014early investigators suggested that the inhabitants lived in the ditches, but this idea was later abandoned in favour of any settlement being within the enclosure boundaries.<ref name=\":7\">Whittle, Healy & Bayliss (2015), p. 5.</ref>  In a 1912 report on an excavation at Knap Hill it was assumed that the ramparts were a form of defence.<ref name=\":6\">Cunnington (1912), p.48.</ref> The causeways were difficult to explain in military terms, though it was suggested they could have been sally ports for defenders to emerge from and attack a besieging force;<ref name=\":6\" /><ref>Curwen (1930), p. 50.</ref> evidence of attacks at some sites provided support for the idea that the enclosures were fortified settlements.<ref name=\":7\" /> They may have been seasonal meeting places, used for trading cattle or other goods such as pottery, and if they were a focus for the local people, they may have been evidence of a local hierarchy with a tribal chief.  There is also evidence that they played a role in funeral rites: material such as food, pottery, and human remains were deliberately deposited in the ditches.<ref>Whittle, Healy & Bayliss (2015), pp. 10\u201311.</ref>  They were constructed in a short time, which implies significant organization since substantial labour would have been required, for clearing the land, preparing trees for use as posts or palisades, and digging the ditches.<ref>Andersen (2019), p. 807.</ref>\n\nIn 1930, the archaeologist [[Cecil Curwen]] identified sixteen sites that were definitely or probably Neolithic causewayed enclosures.<ref>Curwen (1930).</ref><ref name=\":8\">Oswald et al.

Several other upland enclosures are similarly situated, and this is probably not by chance.  [[White Sheet Hill|Whitesheet Hill]], [[Combe Hill]] and Rybury are other examples of enclosures that are hard to identify when seen from the lower ground below them, but which are much more visible viewed from the neighbouring uplands.<ref>Oswald et al.

The western barrow was about {{convert|2|ft|cm|-1|spell=in}} high, with a small ditch around it.  Near the top of the barrow Thurman found animal bones, which he described as \"of a sheep and perhaps other ruminants\", and commented in his account that this was consistent with other barrows in Wiltshire, which often contained animal bones near the surface of the barrow.  He speculated that they were probably from a sacrifice or feast over the graves.  Under the middle of the barrow was a circular hole dug into the chalk, {{convert|2|ft|cm|-1|spell=in}} deep and {{convert|2|ft|cm|-1|spell=in}} across.  It was almost full of ashes and burnt bones. The barrow outside the enclosure, which lay to the southwest, was about a foot (30 cm) high and Thurnam found nothing there but some animal bones near the surface.<ref name=\":11\">Thurnam (1860), pp. 326\u2013327.</ref><ref name=\":10\">Cunnington (1912), p. 43.</ref>\n\n=== Benjamin and Maud Cunnington, 1908-9 ===\nThe Neolithic enclosure was first excavated by [[Maud Cunnington|Maud]] and [[Ben Cunnington (archaeologist)|Benjamin Cunnington]], in the summers of 1908 and 1909.  The first summer's investigation revealed the segmented nature of the earthworks, and led to the publication of a short note by Maud Cunnington in the journal ''[[Man (journal)|Man]]'' in 1909 in which she asked readers of the journal to suggest explanations:<ref>Cunnington (1909), pp. 49\u201352.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Recent excavations [at] Knap Hill Camp in Wiltshire revealed a feature which, if intentional, appears to be a method of defence hitherto unobserved in prehistoric fortifications in Britain...There are six openings or gaps through the rampart.  It was thought at first that...some of these gaps were due to cattle tracks, or possibly had been made for agricultural purposes....  Excavations clearly showed that none of these gaps in the rampart are the result of wear or of any accidental circumstance, but that they are actually part of the original construction of the camp....  Outside of, and corresponding to, each gap the ditch was never dug; that is to say, a solid gangway or causeway of unexcavated ground has been left in each case....Given the need for an entrenchment at all, it seems at first sight inexplicable why these frequent openings should have been left, when apparently they so weaken the whole construction....  It has been suggested...that the work of fortifications was never finished, [but there is] considerable evidence in favour of these causeways being an intentional feature of the original design of the camp... The possible use which the gangways may have served is put forward with all diffidence, and any suggestion on the subject would be welcomed.</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Knap Hill Camp map M.E.

Cunnington considered the plateau enclosure to be no earlier than the early [[Iron Age]].<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":14\" />  The ditch and low rampart that surrounded the enclosure were mostly undetectable on the surface; the Cunningtons cut sections around the perimeter at intervals to confirm their path.<ref name=\":12\" />  A gap was also found in the plateau enclosure ditch at the southwestern edge, where it overlapped with the old enclosure, but Cunnington could not tell what the gap was for\u2014an entrance was implausible as the bank was very steep at that point.<ref name=\":15\" />  The pottery found in the plateau ditch and bank was of much better quality than the coarse Neolithic pottery associated with the old enclosure: it included [[bead-rim pottery]] which Cunnington dated to just before, or during the early years of, the Roman occupation.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 50\u201351.</ref>\n\n[[File:Knap Hill Saxon sword.png|left|thumb|upright=1.8|Anglo-Saxon sword found in the plateau enclosure by the Cunningtons<ref name=\":22\" />]]\nWithin the plateau enclosure was a long bank, running from southwest to northeast, with a circular mound at the northeastern end.  The Cunningtons found pottery sherds in the long bank that she dated to Roman times, and also found in the centre of the bank that two pits lay beneath it, marked P.P. on the plan.  These had been dug from the ground level before the bank was raised, and were both circular, about {{convert|2|ft|cm|-1|spell=in}} deep, and {{convert|3.5|to(-)|4|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter.  These contained flint flakes, coarse pottery and some animal bones, and Cunnington concluded that they were contemporary with the old enclosure and that it was a coincidence the long bank was raised over them.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 51\u201353.</ref>  A 6th-century [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] iron sword was found towards the edge of the long mound (at G on the plan). A round fire hole was found under the circular mound, containing wood ash and pottery, some of which Cunnington identified as Roman.  Another fireplace was found to the southeast of the long mound, in a rectangular area of raised earth (which Cunnington referred to as the dais) ; this fireplace was T-shaped, and contained the lower stone of a [[Quern-stone|quern]], damaged by heat, four iron nails, and several fragments of pottery.  Cunnington suggested that the fireplace must have been unusable once the quern was in it, and that this, along with the presence of the sword and the evidence of intense heat, implied a catastrophic end to the inhabitation of the enclosure.<ref name=\":19\"/>\n\n[[File:Knap Hill 1908-9 excavation section A.png|thumb|upright=2.5|Section through the ditch at cutting A-A in the 1908\u20131909 excavation.<ref name=\":21\" />]]\nBetween the long bank and the dais were the remains of a small building (marked E on the plan), {{convert|23|by|13.5|ft|abbr=on}}, with walls made of blocks of chalk.  Postholes were found at intervals in the walls. A rubbish pile next to the building yielded a sherd of 17th century pottery, and in the area of the building and the dais were numerous clay pipes, some of which retained their makers' stamps and so could be dated with accuracy.  The pipes and the pottery sherds from this area both were dated to the 17th century, mixed with Roman pottery in the dais, which led Cunnington to conclude that the dais had been cultivated by the 17th-century inhabitants of the hilltop, since that would have led to turning the soil on the dais and mixing the sherds at different levels.  The ruins of another rectangular building (F on the plan) was found against the eastern side of the plateau enclosure's bank, with both Roman and 17th-century pottery sherds in the walls and under the foundations.  It was apparent that the building had been erected after the plateau enclosure had been built, but the Cunningtons found no other evidence that would help determine its date.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 55\u201356.</ref>\n\nThe Cunningtons also opened the barrow outside the old enclosure, to the southwest (not marked on their plan, but labelled \"Grinsell 10\" on Connah's plan, below), and found a skeleton fairly near the surface, face down.  It was missing all the bones of the legs and feet, and the right hand; Cunnington speculated that the skeleton had been placed so near the surface of the barrow that the missing bones had been disturbed by animals.  The only pottery sherds found were from the Roman period and were all near the surface, implying that the burial preceded the Roman occupation.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 58\u201359.</ref>\n\nTwo low banks were found, running down the hill: one from the two ditches marked S on the plan, and one on the other side of the enclosure, leading down from one of the causeways on the northwestern edge.  The one to the east was known locally as \"The Devil's Trackway\".  The northwestern bank led for {{convert|50|yd|m|spell=in}} towards an old track across the hill.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== C.W. Phillips, 1939 ===\nIn 1939 C.W. Phillips excavated a [[bowl barrow]] outside the enclosure, but never published a report.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />  Two barrows outside the enclosure are listed in a gazetteer of Wiltshire by [[Leslie Grinsell]], published in 1957, identified as Alton 10 and Alton 13.  Phillips excavated Alton 13, but it may be that the two barrows are the same, in which case the barrow Phillips excavated was the same one that Thurman investigated in the 1850s.  Phillips found a crouched burial, at the old ground surface, and Neolithic potsherds; the potsherds may not indicate that the barrow is of Neolithic date since the sherds might have been present on the site at the time the barrow was constructed.  Grinsell cites Phillips to say that the barrow lay to the south of the causewayed enclosure, and if this is correct it is not the same barrow that Thurman opened.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Graham Connah, 1961 ===\n[[File:Knap Hill map RHCM Connah 1961.png|thumb|upright=4|Knap Hill site, showing trenches (i through iii) and the excavated area (iv) from the 1961 excavation<ref name=\":16\" />]]\nIn 1961, the causewayed enclosure was excavated again, by [[Graham Connah]].<ref name=\":4\" />  Three trenches (i to iii in the diagram at right) were cut across three different segments of the ditches and banks, and one causeway (iv in the diagram) was fully excavated, including both ends of the two ditches abutting it.<ref>Connah (1965), pp. 2\u20133.</ref>  Like the Cunningtons, Connah found a knapping cluster at the surface of the chalk in one of his cuttings.<ref name=\":18\" />  Connah found only a few sherds of pottery, and so combined his finds with those from the earlier excavation for analysis purposes, though some documentation on the exact provenance of the earlier finds had been lost since 1912.  Most of the sherds found in 1961 had flint [[Temper (pottery)|inclusions]], but four sherds, from a single pot, had shell inclusions, and so must have come from at least {{convert|20|mi|km}} away.  Similar combinations of finds had been reported at [[Windmill Hill, Avebury|Windmill Hill]], [[Robin Hood's Ball]], and [[White Sheet Hill|Whitesheet Hill]].<ref name=\":5\">Connah (1965), p. 11.</ref>  Connah classified the pottery from the ditches as [[Windmill Hill ware]],<ref name=\":5\" /> a classification current in the 1960s that attempted to identify individual cultures within the Neolithic, but since overturned in favour of separating Neolithic sites into Early and Late Neolithic.<ref>Pouncett (2008), p. 37.</ref>\n\nIn addition to the Windmill Hill ware, fragments from seven or eight pots of [[Beaker ware]] were found;<ref name=\":23\">Connah (1965), p. 12\u201314.</ref> Connah suggested they may have come from visits to the hill top, rather than an occupation.<ref>Connah (1965), p. 22.</ref>  Connah also found some Romano-British pottery in his cuttings, including four [[Samian ware|Samian]] sherds, one of which could be dated to the late 1st century AD.  Some later medieval pottery fragments were found in the upper layers of the cuttings, all of which may have originally been part of a single vessel. These sherds could not be accurately dated.<ref name=\":23\" />\n\nIn one of the cuttings a skeleton of a woman was found, near the top of the ditch.  Nails found around the feet were interpreted as the remains of boots that had been reinforced with them.  Connah concluded that the skeleton probably dated to the Roman-British occupation, and that the Neolithic ditch was simply an area of conveniently soft ground for the burial.<ref>Connah (1965), p. 7.</ref>  The woman was probably in her 40s when she died, and was about {{convert|5|ft|2|in|m}} tall.  She suffered from [[osteoarthritis]], and had abcesses in her jaw: an evaluation by the Duckworth Laboratory in Cambridge concluded that she \"most probably suffered agonies\".<ref>Connah (1965). pp. 18\u201319.</ref>\n\nConnah identified ditches on both sides of the bank leading down from the eastern corner of the causewayed enclosure, and his excavation of one of the causeways (marked \"iv\" on his plan) found a shallow ditch cut in the chalk along the line of the bank leading down the hill on that side, which lay beneath a ditch along one side of that bank.  None of these ditches had been noticed by the Cunningtons.  Connah concluded that both were likely to have been constructed to mark boundaries.<ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":17\" />\n\n=== Gathering Time, 2011 ===\nIn 2011, the Gathering Time project published the results of a programme to reanalyze the [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dates]] of nearly 40 causewayed enclosures, using [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian analysis]].  Knap Hill was one of the sites included in the project.  Connah had obtained two radiocarbon dates on samples gathered during the 1961 excavation, which he had published in 1969; these results were included in the Gathering Time analysis, and one was resampled and tested again.  Five other samples drawn from Connah's finds were also radiocarbon dated, as Connah's stratigraphic recording was precise enough to make it possible to identify samples which had good [[Glossary of archaeology|association]] with the building of the enclosure.  The conclusion was that there was a 91% chance that Knap Hill was constructed between 3530 and 3375 BC, and a 92% chance that the ditch had silted up at some time between 3525 and 3220 BC.<ref>Whittle, Bayliss & Healy (2015), pp. 99\u2013102.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n<references group=notes/>\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== Sources ==\n\n*{{Cite book|last=Andersen|first=Niels H.|title=The Oxford Handbook of Neolithic Europe|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2019|isbn=978-0-19-883249-2|editor-last=Fowler|editor-first=Chris|location=Oxford|pages=795\u2013812|chapter=Causewayed Enclosures in Northern and Western Europe|orig-year=2015|editor-last2=Harding|editor-first2=Jan|editor-last3=Hofmann|editor-first3=Daniela}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Connah|first=Graham|date=1969|title=Radiocarbon dating for Knap Hill|journal=Antiquity|volume=43|pages=304\u2013305|issue=172|doi=10.1017/S0003598X00107483|url=|ref=none}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Connah|first=Graham|last2=Smith|first2=I.F.|date=1965|title=Excavations at Knap Hill, Alton Priors|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/138882#page/7/mode/1up|journal=Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Magazine|volume=60|pages=1\u201323|via=}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Crawford|first=O.G.S.|title=Archaeology in the Field|publisher=Phoenix House|year=1960|location=London|pages=|orig-year=1953}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Cunnington|first=M.E.|year=1909|title=On a remarkable feature in the entrenchments of Knap Hill Camp, Wiltshire|jstor=2839810|journal=Man|volume=9|pages=49\u201352|doi=10.2307/2839810}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=Cunnington|first=M.E.|date=1912|title=Knap Hill Camp|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/132441#page/68/mode/1up|journal=Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Magazine|volume=37|pages=42\u201365|via=}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Curwen|first=E.

At the top of the hill is a [[causewayed enclosure]], a form of [[Neolithic]] earthwork which began to appear in England from about 3700 BC, characterized by the full or partial enclosure of an area with ditches that are interrupted by gaps, or causeways.  It is not known what they were used for; they may have been settlements, or meeting places, or ritual sites of some kind.  Knap Hill is notable for having been the first causewayed enclosure to be excavated and identified, and has been scheduled as an [[ancient monument]].\n\n[[Ben Cunnington (archaeologist)|Benjamin]] and [[Maud Cunnington]] spent two summers investigating the site, in 1908 and 1909, and Maud published two reports of their work, noting that there were several gaps in the ditch and bank surrounding the enclosure.  In the late 1920s, after the excavation of [[Windmill Hill, Avebury|Windmill Hill]] among other sites, it became apparent that causewayed enclosures were a characteristic monument of the Neolithic period.  At first they were thought to have been inhabited, and so were called \"causewayed camps\", but that name has fallen out of use.  About seventy causewayed enclosures have now been found in Britain, and about a thousand in all in Europe.  The site was excavated again in 1961 by [[Graham Connah]], who kept thorough stratigraphic documentation. In 2011 the Gathering Time project published an analysis of [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dates]] from almost forty British causewayed enclosures, including several new dates from Connah's finds.  The conclusion was that there was a 91% chance that Knap Hill was constructed between 3530 and 3375 BC, and a 92% chance that the ditch had silted up at some time between 3525 and 3220 BC.\n\nTwo barrows lay within the Neolithic enclosure, and at least one more outside it.  The hilltop also contains the remains of a Romano-British settlement on an adjoining smaller area called the plateau enclosure, along with some evidence of occupation in the 17th century. An [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] sword was found in the smaller enclosure, and there is evidence of an intense fire in the same area, which may imply a violent end to the Romano-British occupation of the hilltop.\n\nKnap lies between Golden Ball Hill, to the east, and Walker Hill, to the west.  Two other Neolithic sites are nearby: [[Adam's Grave]], a chambered [[long barrow]] on Walker Hill, less than a mile (1.6 km) away, and [[Rybury]], another causewayed enclosure, {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} beyond Adam's Grave.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Knap Hill area from OS map 1961.png|thumb|upright=3|Area around Knap Hill in Wiltshire]]\nThe main archaeological site at Knap Hill is a [[causewayed enclosure]],<ref>Oswald et al.

There is also evidence that they played a role in funeral rites: material such as food, pottery, and human remains were deliberately deposited in the ditches.<ref>Whittle, Healy & Bayliss (2015), pp. 10\u201311.</ref>  They were constructed in a short time, which implies significant organization since substantial labour would have been required, for clearing the land, preparing trees for use as posts or palisades, and digging the ditches.<ref>Andersen (2019), p. 807.</ref>\n\nIn 1930, the archaeologist [[Cecil Curwen]] identified sixteen sites that were definitely or probably Neolithic causewayed enclosures.<ref>Curwen (1930).</ref><ref name=\":8\">Oswald et al.

The first summer's investigation revealed the segmented nature of the earthworks, and led to the publication of a short note by Maud Cunnington in the journal ''[[Man (journal)|Man]]'' in 1909 in which she asked readers of the journal to suggest explanations:<ref>Cunnington (1909), pp. 49\u201352.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Recent excavations [at] Knap Hill Camp in Wiltshire revealed a feature which, if intentional, appears to be a method of defence hitherto unobserved in prehistoric fortifications in Britain...There are six openings or gaps through the rampart.  It was thought at first that...some of these gaps were due to cattle tracks, or possibly had been made for agricultural purposes....  Excavations clearly showed that none of these gaps in the rampart are the result of wear or of any accidental circumstance, but that they are actually part of the original construction of the camp....  Outside of, and corresponding to, each gap the ditch was never dug; that is to say, a solid gangway or causeway of unexcavated ground has been left in each case....Given the need for an entrenchment at all, it seems at first sight inexplicable why these frequent openings should have been left, when apparently they so weaken the whole construction....  It has been suggested...that the work of fortifications was never finished, [but there is] considerable evidence in favour of these causeways being an intentional feature of the original design of the camp... The possible use which the gangways may have served is put forward with all diffidence, and any suggestion on the subject would be welcomed.</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Knap Hill Camp map M.E.

Cunnington considered the plateau enclosure to be no earlier than the early [[Iron Age]].<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":14\" />  The ditch and low rampart that surrounded the enclosure were mostly undetectable on the surface; the Cunningtons cut sections around the perimeter at intervals to confirm their path.<ref name=\":12\" />  A gap was also found in the plateau enclosure ditch at the southwestern edge, where it overlapped with the old enclosure, but Cunnington could not tell what the gap was for\u2014an entrance was implausible as the bank was very steep at that point.<ref name=\":15\" />  The pottery found in the plateau ditch and bank was of much better quality than the coarse Neolithic pottery associated with the old enclosure: it included [[bead-rim pottery]] which Cunnington dated to just before, or during the early years of, the Roman occupation.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 50\u201351.</ref>\n\n[[File:Knap Hill Saxon sword.png|left|thumb|upright=1.8|Anglo-Saxon sword found in the plateau enclosure by the Cunningtons<ref name=\":22\" />]]\nWithin the plateau enclosure was a long bank, running from southwest to northeast, with a circular mound at the northeastern end.  The Cunningtons found pottery sherds in the long bank that she dated to Roman times, and also found in the centre of the bank that two pits lay beneath it, marked P.P. on the plan.  These had been dug from the ground level before the bank was raised, and were both circular, about {{convert|2|ft|cm|-1|spell=in}} deep, and {{convert|3.5|to(-)|4|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter.  These contained flint flakes, coarse pottery and some animal bones, and Cunnington concluded that they were contemporary with the old enclosure and that it was a coincidence the long bank was raised over them.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 51\u201353.</ref>  A 6th-century [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] iron sword was found towards the edge of the long mound (at G on the plan). A round fire hole was found under the circular mound, containing wood ash and pottery, some of which Cunnington identified as Roman.  Another fireplace was found to the southeast of the long mound, in a rectangular area of raised earth (which Cunnington referred to as the dais) ; this fireplace was T-shaped, and contained the lower stone of a [[Quern-stone|quern]], damaged by heat, four iron nails, and several fragments of pottery.  Cunnington suggested that the fireplace must have been unusable once the quern was in it, and that this, along with the presence of the sword and the evidence of intense heat, implied a catastrophic end to the inhabitation of the enclosure.<ref name=\":19\"/>\n\n[[File:Knap Hill 1908-9 excavation section A.png|thumb|upright=2.5|Section through the ditch at cutting A-A in the 1908\u20131909 excavation.<ref name=\":21\" />]]\nBetween the long bank and the dais were the remains of a small building (marked E on the plan), {{convert|23|by|13.5|ft|abbr=on}}, with walls made of blocks of chalk.  Postholes were found at intervals in the walls. A rubbish pile next to the building yielded a sherd of 17th century pottery, and in the area of the building and the dais were numerous clay pipes, some of which retained their makers' stamps and so could be dated with accuracy.  The pipes and the pottery sherds from this area both were dated to the 17th century, mixed with Roman pottery in the dais, which led Cunnington to conclude that the dais had been cultivated by the 17th-century inhabitants of the hilltop, since that would have led to turning the soil on the dais and mixing the sherds at different levels.  The ruins of another rectangular building (F on the plan) was found against the eastern side of the plateau enclosure's bank, with both Roman and 17th-century pottery sherds in the walls and under the foundations.  It was apparent that the building had been erected after the plateau enclosure had been built, but the Cunningtons found no other evidence that would help determine its date.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 55\u201356.</ref>\n\nThe Cunningtons also opened the barrow outside the old enclosure, to the southwest (not marked on their plan, but labelled \"Grinsell 10\" on Connah's plan, below), and found a skeleton fairly near the surface, face down.  It was missing all the bones of the legs and feet, and the right hand; Cunnington speculated that the skeleton had been placed so near the surface of the barrow that the missing bones had been disturbed by animals.  The only pottery sherds found were from the Roman period and were all near the surface, implying that the burial preceded the Roman occupation.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 58\u201359.</ref>\n\nTwo low banks were found, running down the hill: one from the two ditches marked S on the plan, and one on the other side of the enclosure, leading down from one of the causeways on the northwestern edge.  The one to the east was known locally as \"The Devil's Trackway\".  The northwestern bank led for {{convert|50|yd|m|spell=in}} towards an old track across the hill.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== C.W. Phillips, 1939 ===\nIn 1939 C.W. Phillips excavated a [[bowl barrow]] outside the enclosure, but never published a report.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />  Two barrows outside the enclosure are listed in a gazetteer of Wiltshire by [[Leslie Grinsell]], published in 1957, identified as Alton 10 and Alton 13.  Phillips excavated Alton 13, but it may be that the two barrows are the same, in which case the barrow Phillips excavated was the same one that Thurman investigated in the 1850s.  Phillips found a crouched burial, at the old ground surface, and Neolithic potsherds; the potsherds may not indicate that the barrow is of Neolithic date since the sherds might have been present on the site at the time the barrow was constructed.  Grinsell cites Phillips to say that the barrow lay to the south of the causewayed enclosure, and if this is correct it is not the same barrow that Thurman opened.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Graham Connah, 1961 ===\n[[File:Knap Hill map RHCM Connah 1961.png|thumb|center|upright=4|Knap Hill site, showing trenches (i through iii) and the excavated area (iv) from the 1961 excavation<ref name=\":16\" />]]{{clear}}\nIn 1961, the causewayed enclosure was excavated again, by [[Graham Connah]].<ref name=\":4\" />  Three trenches (i to iii in the diagram at right) were cut across three different segments of the ditches and banks, and one causeway (iv in the diagram) was fully excavated, including both ends of the two ditches abutting it.<ref>Connah (1965), pp. 2\u20133.</ref>  Like the Cunningtons, Connah found a knapping cluster at the surface of the chalk in one of his cuttings.<ref name=\":18\" />  Connah found only a few sherds of pottery, and so combined his finds with those from the earlier excavation for analysis purposes, though some documentation on the exact provenance of the earlier finds had been lost since 1912.  Most of the sherds found in 1961 had flint [[Temper (pottery)|inclusions]], but four sherds, from a single pot, had shell inclusions, and so must have come from at least {{convert|20|mi|km}} away.

Some later medieval pottery fragments were found in the upper layers of the cuttings, all of which may have originally been part of a single vessel. These sherds could not be accurately dated.<ref name=\":23\" />\n\nIn one of the cuttings a skeleton of a woman was found, near the top of the ditch.  Nails found around the feet were interpreted as the remains of boots that had been reinforced with them.  Connah concluded that the skeleton probably dated to the Roman-British occupation, and that the Neolithic ditch was simply an area of conveniently soft ground for the burial.<ref>Connah (1965), p. 7.</ref>  The woman was probably in her 40s when she died, and was about {{convert|5|ft|2|in|m}} tall.  She suffered from [[osteoarthritis]], and had abcesses in her jaw: an evaluation by the Duckworth Laboratory in Cambridge concluded that she \"most probably suffered agonies\".<ref>Connah (1965). pp. 18\u201319.</ref>\n\nConnah identified ditches on both sides of the bank leading down from the eastern corner of the causewayed enclosure, and his excavation of one of the causeways (marked \"iv\" on his plan) found a shallow ditch cut in the chalk along the line of the bank leading down the hill on that side, which lay beneath a ditch along one side of that bank.  None of these ditches had been noticed by the Cunningtons.  Connah concluded that both were likely to have been constructed to mark boundaries.<ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":17\" />\n\n=== Gathering Time, 2011 ===\nIn 2011, the Gathering Time project published the results of a programme to reanalyze the [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dates]] of nearly 40 causewayed enclosures, using [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian analysis]].  Knap Hill was one of the sites included in the project.  Connah had obtained two radiocarbon dates on samples gathered during the 1961 excavation, which he had published in 1969; these results were included in the Gathering Time analysis, and one was resampled and tested again.

Frequent re-piercings can also damage the nipple and cause complications. It is also recommended that the piercing be healed before breastfeeding. Most body piercing professionals will refuse to pierce a pregnant woman for this reason and because piercing causes stress on the body that could potentially complicate a [[pregnancy]].\n\nSeveral complications have been noted involving [[breastfeeding]] with a piercing present, so it is recommended to remove nipple jewelry before nursing.

Your breasts will still produce adequate milk for your baby, and unless your body rejected the piercing right after you had it done, there is no reason to anticipate any additional problems with infection. It is unlikely that the holes that are left in your nipple will cause a problem. Each nipple has between fifteen and twenty tiny nipple pores that the milk comes out of, so even if some were damaged, there should be plenty left for nursing. Breast surgery often damages the milk ducts inside the breast, and this can definitely create problems.

It is unlikely that the holes that are left in your nipple will cause a problem. Each nipple has between fifteen and twenty tiny nipple pores that the milk comes out of, so even if some were damaged, there should be plenty left for nursing. Breast surgery often damages the milk ducts inside the breast, and this can definitely create problems.

Unix systems are characterized by various concepts: the use of [[plain text]] for storing data; a hierarchical [[file system]]; treating devices and certain types of [[inter-process communication]] (IPC) as files; and the use of a large number of [[programming tool|software tools]], small programs that can be strung together through a [[command-line interpreter]] using [[pipeline (Unix)|pipes]], as opposed to using a single monolithic program that includes all of the same functionality.  These concepts are collectively known as the \"[[Unix philosophy]]\".  [[Brian Kernighan]] and [[Rob Pike]] summarize this in ''[[The Unix Programming Environment]]'' as \"the idea that the power of a system comes more from the relationships among programs than from the programs themselves\".<ref>Kernighan, Brian W. Pike, Rob. ''The UNIX Programming Environment.'' 1984. viii</ref>\n\nIn an era when a standard computer consisted of a hard disk for storage and a [[data terminal]] for [[Input/output|input and output]] (I/O), the Unix file model worked quite well, as I/O was generally linear.  In the 1980s, [[non-blocking I/O]] and the set of [[inter-process communication]] mechanisms were augmented with [[Unix domain socket]]s, [[shared memory]], [[message queue]]s, and [[semaphore (programming)|semaphores]], as well as [[network socket]]s to support communication with other hosts. As graphical user interfaces developed, the file model proved inadequate to the task of handling asynchronous events such as those generated by a [[computer mouse|mouse]].\n\nBy the early 1980s, users began seeing Unix as a potential universal operating system, suitable for computers of all sizes.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1983-10/1983_10_BYTE_08-10_UNIX#page/n133/mode/2up | title=The Unix Tutorial / Part 3: Unix in the Microcomputer Marketplace | work=BYTE | date=October 1983 | accessdate=January 30, 2015 | author=Fiedler, Ryan | page=132}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |quote=The best thing about UNIX is its portability.

The kernel provides services to start and stop programs, handles the [[file system]] and other common \"low-level\" tasks that most programs share, and schedules access to avoid conflicts when programs try to access the same resource or device simultaneously.  To mediate such access, the kernel has special rights, reflected in the distinction of ''kernel space'' from [[user space]], the latter being a priority realm where most application programs operate.\n\n== History ==\n{{main|History of Unix}}\n[[File:Ken Thompson (sitting) and Dennis Ritchie at PDP-11 (2876612463).jpg|thumb|[[Ken Thompson]] (sitting) and [[Dennis Ritchie]] working together at a [[PDP-11]]]]\n\nThe origins of Unix date back to the mid-1960s when the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[Bell Labs]], and [[General Electric]] were developing [[Multics]], a [[time-sharing]] operating system for the [[GE-600 series|GE-645]] mainframe computer.<ref>{{cite book\n|title=Principles of operating systems: design & applications\n|last=Stuart |first=Brian L.\n|year=2009\n|publisher=Thompson Learning\n|location=Boston, Massachusetts\n|isbn=978-1-4188-3769-3\n|page=23\n}}</ref>\nMultics featured [[Multics#Novel ideas|several innovations]], but also presented severe problems.

In the late 1980s, AT&T [[Unix System Laboratories]] and [[Sun Microsystems]] developed System&nbsp;V Release&nbsp;4 ([[SVR4]]), which was subsequently adopted by many commercial Unix vendors.\n\nIn the 1990s, Unix and Unix-like systems grew in popularity as BSD and [[Linux]] distributions were developed through collaboration by a worldwide network of programmers.

In the early 1990s, a separate but very similar effort was started by an industry consortium, the [[Common Open Software Environment]] (COSE) initiative, which eventually became the [[Single UNIX Specification]] (SUS) administered by [[The Open Group]]. Starting in 1998, the Open Group and IEEE started the [[Austin Group]], to provide a common definition of POSIX and the Single UNIX Specification, which, by 2008, had become the Open Group Base Specification.\n\nIn 1999, in an effort towards compatibility, several Unix system vendors agreed on SVR4's [[Executable and Linkable Format]] (ELF) as the standard for binary and object code files. The common format allows substantial binary compatibility among different Unix systems operating on the same CPU architecture.\n\nThe [[Filesystem Hierarchy Standard]] was created to provide a reference directory layout for Unix-like operating systems; it has mainly been used in Linux.\n\n== Components ==\n{{see also|List of Unix commands}}\n{{Unreferenced|date=January 2017|section}}\n\nThe Unix system is composed of several components that were originally packaged together. By including the development environment, libraries, documents and the portable, modifiable source code for all of these components, in addition to the [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]] of an operating system, Unix was a self-contained software system. This was one of the key reasons it emerged as an important teaching and learning tool and has had such a broad influence.{{according to whom|date=April 2015}}\n\nThe inclusion of these components did not make the system large{{snd}} the original V7 UNIX distribution, consisting of copies of all of the compiled binaries plus all of the source code and documentation occupied less than 10&nbsp;MB and arrived on a single nine-track [[Magnetic tape data storage|magnetic tape]]. The printed documentation, typeset from the online sources, was contained in two volumes.\n\nThe names and filesystem locations of the Unix components have changed substantially across the history of the system. Nonetheless, the V7 implementation is considered by many{{who|date=February 2014}} to have the canonical early structure:\n* ''Kernel''{{snd}} source code in /usr/sys, composed of several sub-components:\n** ''conf''{{snd}} configuration and machine-dependent parts, including boot code\n** ''dev''{{snd}} device drivers for control of hardware (and some pseudo-hardware)\n** ''sys''{{snd}} operating system \"kernel\", handling memory management, process scheduling, system calls, etc.\n** ''h''{{snd}} header files, defining key structures within the system and important system-specific invariables\n* ''Development environment''{{snd}} early versions of Unix contained a development environment sufficient to recreate the entire system from source code:\n** ''cc''{{snd}} [[C (programming language)|C language]] compiler (first appeared in V3 Unix)\n** ''as''{{snd}} machine-language assembler for the machine\n** ''ld''{{snd}} linker, for combining object files\n** ''lib''{{snd}} object-code libraries (installed in /lib or /usr/lib). ''[[libc]]'', the system library with C run-time support, was the primary library, but there have always been additional libraries for things such as mathematical functions (''[[libm]]'') or database access. V7 Unix introduced the first version of the modern \"Standard I/O\" library ''stdio'' as part of the system library. Later implementations increased the number of libraries significantly.\n** ''[[make (software)|make]]''{{snd}} build manager (introduced in [[PWB/UNIX]]), for effectively automating the build process\n** ''include''{{snd}} header files for software development, defining standard interfaces and system invariants\n** ''Other languages''{{snd}} V7 Unix contained a Fortran-77 compiler, a programmable arbitrary-precision calculator (''bc'', ''dc''), and the [[awk]] scripting language; later versions and implementations contain many other language compilers and toolsets. Early BSD releases included [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] tools, and many modern Unix systems also include the [[GNU Compiler Collection]] as well as or instead of a proprietary compiler system.\n** ''Other tools''{{snd}} including an object-code archive manager (''ar''), symbol-table lister (''nm''), compiler-development tools (e.g. ''[[Lex (software)|lex]]'' & ''[[yacc]]''), and debugging tools.\n* ''Commands''{{snd}} Unix makes little distinction between commands (user-level programs) for system operation and maintenance (e.g. ''[[cron]]''), commands of general utility (e.g. ''[[grep]]''), and more general-purpose applications such as the text formatting and typesetting package. Nonetheless, some major categories are:\n** ''[[Bourne shell|sh]]''{{snd}} the \"shell\" programmable [[command-line interpreter]], the primary user interface on Unix before window systems appeared, and even afterward (within a \"command window\").\n** ''Utilities''{{snd}} the core toolkit of the Unix command set, including ''[[cp (Unix)|cp]]'', ''[[ls]]'', ''[[grep]]'', ''[[find (Unix)|find]]'' and many others. Subcategories include:\n*** ''System utilities''{{snd}} administrative tools such as ''[[mkfs]]'', ''[[fsck]]'', and many others.\n*** ''User utilities''{{snd}} environment management tools such as ''passwd'', ''kill'', and others.\n** ''Document formatting''{{snd}} Unix systems were used from the outset for document preparation and typesetting systems, and included many related programs such as ''[[nroff]]'', ''[[troff]]'', ''[[tbl]]'', ''[[eqn (software)|eqn]]'', ''[[refer (software)|refer]]'', and ''[[Pic language|pic]]''. Some modern Unix systems also include packages such as [[TeX]] and [[Ghostscript]].\n** ''Graphics''{{snd}} the ''plot'' subsystem provided facilities for producing simple vector plots in a device-independent format, with device-specific interpreters to display such files. Modern Unix systems also generally include [[X11]] as a standard windowing system and [[GUI]], and many support [[OpenGL]].\n** ''Communications''{{snd}} early Unix systems contained no inter-system communication, but did include the inter-user communication programs ''mail'' and ''write''. V7 introduced the early inter-system communication system [[UUCP]], and systems beginning with BSD release 4.1c included [[TCP/IP]] utilities.\n* ''Documentation''{{snd}} Unix was the first{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} operating system to include all of its documentation online in machine-readable form. The documentation included:\n** ''[[man page|man]]''{{snd}} manual pages for each command, library component, [[system call]], header file, etc.\n** ''doc''{{snd}} longer documents detailing major subsystems, such as the C language and troff\n\n== Impact ==\n{{See also|Unix-like}}\n{{More citations needed|section|date=January 2017}}\n\n[[File:Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie.jpg|thumb|[[Ken Thompson]] and [[Dennis Ritchie]], principal developers of [[Research Unix]]]]\n[[File:Usenix84 1.jpg|thumb|Photo from [[USENIX]] 1984, including [[Dennis Ritchie]] (center)]]\n[[File:Plan 9 from Bell Labs (with acme).png|thumb|[[Plan 9 from Bell Labs]] extends Unix design principles and was developed as a successor to Unix.]]\n\nThe Unix system had a significant impact on other operating systems. It achieved its reputation by its interactivity, by providing the software at a nominal fee for educational use, by running on inexpensive hardware, and by being easy to adapt and move to different machines. Unix was originally written in [[assembly language]], but was soon rewritten in [[C (programming language)|C]], a [[high-level programming language]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Ritchie, Dennis |url=https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/hist.html |title=The Evolution of the Unix Time-sharing System |year=1979 |accessdate=April 30, 2016 |publisher=Bell Labs |quote=Perhaps the most important watershed occurred during 1973, when the operating system kernel was rewritten in C. |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611114353/https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/hist.html |archivedate=June 11, 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Although this followed the lead of [[Multics]] and [[Burroughs large systems|Burroughs]], it was Unix that popularized the idea.\n\nUnix had a drastically simplified file model compared to many contemporary operating systems: treating all kinds of files as simple byte arrays. The file system hierarchy contained machine services and devices (such as [[computer printer|printers]], [[computer terminal|terminals]], or [[disk drive]]s), providing a uniform interface, but at the expense of occasionally requiring additional mechanisms such as [[ioctl]] and mode flags to access features of the hardware that did not fit the simple \"stream of bytes\" model. The [[Plan 9 from Bell Labs|Plan 9]] operating system pushed this model even further and eliminated the need for additional mechanisms.\n\nUnix also popularized the hierarchical file system with arbitrarily nested subdirectories, originally introduced by Multics. Other common operating systems of the era had ways to divide a storage device into multiple directories or sections, but they had a fixed number of levels, often only one level. Several major proprietary operating systems eventually added recursive subdirectory capabilities also patterned after Multics. DEC's [[RSX-11]]M's \"group, user\" hierarchy evolved into [[Virtual Memory System|VMS]] directories, [[CP/M]]'s volumes evolved into [[MS-DOS]] 2.0+ subdirectories, and HP's [[HP Multi-Programming Executive|MPE]] group.account hierarchy and IBM's [[System Support Program|SSP]] and [[OS/400]] library systems were folded into broader POSIX file systems.\n\nMaking the command interpreter an ordinary user-level program, with additional commands provided as separate programs, was another Multics innovation popularized by Unix. The [[Unix shell]] used the same language for interactive commands as for scripting ([[shell script]]s&nbsp;\u2013 there was no separate job control language like IBM's [[Job Control Language|JCL]]). Since the shell and OS commands were \"just another program\", the user could choose (or even write) their own shell. New commands could be added without changing the shell itself. Unix's innovative command-line syntax for creating modular chains of producer-consumer processes ([[pipeline (Unix)|pipelines]]) made a powerful programming paradigm ([[coroutine]]s) widely available. Many later command-line interpreters have been inspired by the Unix shell.\n\nA fundamental simplifying assumption of Unix was its focus on [[newline]]-[[Delimiter|delimited]] text for nearly all file formats. There were no \"binary\" editors in the original version of Unix&nbsp;\u2013 the entire system was configured using textual shell command scripts. The common denominator in the I/O system was the byte&nbsp;\u2013 unlike [[Record-oriented filesystem|\"record-based\" file systems]]. The focus on text for representing nearly everything made Unix pipes especially useful and encouraged the development of simple, general tools that could be easily combined to perform more complicated ''ad hoc'' tasks. The focus on text and bytes made the system far more scalable and portable than other systems. Over time, text-based applications have also proven popular in application areas, such as printing languages ([[PostScript]], [[ODF]]), and at the application layer of the [[Internet Protocol Suite|Internet protocols]], e.g., [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]], [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]], [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]], [[SOAP]], and [[Session Initiation Protocol|SIP]].\n\nUnix popularized a syntax for [[regular expression]]s that found widespread use. The Unix programming interface became the basis for a widely implemented operating system interface standard (POSIX, see above). The [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] soon spread beyond Unix, and is now ubiquitous in systems and applications programming.\n\nEarly Unix developers were important in bringing the concepts of [[Modularity (programming)|modularity]] and [[reusability]] into [[software engineering]] practice, spawning a \"software tools\" movement. Over time, the leading developers of Unix (and programs that ran on it) established a set of cultural norms for developing software, norms which became as important and influential as the technology of Unix itself; this has been termed the [[Unix philosophy]].\n\nThe [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP networking protocols]] were quickly implemented on the Unix versions widely used on relatively inexpensive computers, which contributed to the [[Internet]] explosion of worldwide real-time connectivity, and which formed the basis for implementations on many other platforms.\n\nThe Unix policy of extensive on-line documentation and (for many years) ready access to all system source code raised programmer expectations, and contributed to the launch of the [[free software movement]] in 1983.\n\n=== Free Unix and Unix-like variants ===\n{{See also|Operating system#Unix and Unix-like operating systems}}\n{{Multiple image\n | width = 220\n | direction = vertical\n | image1 = Debian 6.0 Console Login.png\n | image2 = FreeBSD 9.1 Console Login.png\n | footer = Console screenshots of [[Debian]] (top, a popular [[Linux distribution]]) and [[FreeBSD]] (bottom, a popular [[Unix-like]] operating system)\n}}\n\nIn 1983, [[Richard Stallman]] announced the [[GNU]] (short for \"GNU's Not Unix\") project, an ambitious effort to create a [[free software]] [[Unix-like]] system; \"free\" in the sense that everyone who received a copy would be free to use, study, modify, and redistribute it. The GNU project's own kernel development project, [[GNU Hurd]], had not yet produced a working kernel, but in 1991 [[Linus Torvalds]] released the kernel [[Linux kernel|Linux]] as free software under the [[GNU General Public License]]. In addition to their use in the [[GNU]] operating system, many GNU packages&nbsp;\u2013 such as the [[GNU Compiler Collection]] (and the rest of the [[GNU toolchain]]), the [[glibc|GNU C library]] and the [[Coreutils|GNU core utilities]]&nbsp;\u2013 have gone on to play central roles in other free Unix systems as well.\n\n[[Linux distribution]]s, consisting of the Linux kernel and large collections of compatible software have become popular both with individual users and in business. Popular distributions include [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]], [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]], [[SUSE Linux|SUSE Linux Enterprise]], [[openSUSE]], [[Debian|Debian GNU/Linux]], [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]], [[Linux Mint]], [[Mandriva Linux]], [[Slackware Linux]], [[Arch Linux]] and [[Gentoo Linux|Gentoo]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major| title=Distrowatch: Top Ten Distributions}}</ref>\n\nA free derivative of [[BSD]] Unix, [[386BSD]], was released in 1992 and led to the [[NetBSD]] and [[FreeBSD]] projects. With the 1994 settlement of a lawsuit brought against the University of California and Berkeley Software Design Inc. (''[[USL v. BSDi]]'') by [[Unix System Laboratories]], it was clarified that Berkeley had the right to distribute BSD Unix for free if it so desired. Since then, BSD Unix has been developed in several different product branches, including [[OpenBSD]] and [[DragonFly BSD]].\n\nLinux and BSD are increasingly filling the market needs traditionally served by proprietary Unix operating systems, as well as expanding into new markets such as the consumer desktop and mobile and embedded devices. Because of the modular design of the Unix model, sharing components is relatively common; consequently, most or all Unix and Unix-like systems include at least some BSD code, and some systems also include GNU utilities in their distributions.\n\nIn a 1999 interview, Dennis Ritchie voiced his opinion that Linux and BSD operating systems are a continuation of the basis of the Unix design, and are derivatives of Unix:<ref name=\"Interview_1999\">{{cite web|author=Benet, Manuel|url=http://www.linuxfocus.org/English/July1999/article79.html|title=Interview With Dennis M.

Linux seems to be the among the healthiest of the direct Unix derivatives, though there are also the various BSD systems as well as the more official offerings from the workstation and mainframe manufacturers.}}\n\nIn the same interview, he states that he views both Unix and Linux as \"the continuation of ideas that were started by Ken and me and many others, many years ago\".<ref name=\"Interview_1999\" />\n\n[[OpenSolaris]] was the open-source counterpart to [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] developed by [[Sun Microsystems]], which included a [[CDDL]]-licensed kernel and a primarily [[GNU]] userland. However, [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] discontinued the project upon their acquisition of Sun, which prompted a group of former Sun employees and members of the OpenSolaris community to fork OpenSolaris into the [[illumos]] kernel. As of 2014, illumos remains the only active open-source System V derivative.\n\n=== ARPANET ===\nIn May 1975, RFC 681 described the development of ''Network Unix'' by the Center for Advanced Computation at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]]. The system was said to \"present several interesting capabilities as an [[ARPANET]] mini-host\". At the time Unix required a license from [[Bell Laboratories]] that at $20,000(US) was very expensive for non-[[university]] users, while an educational license cost just $150. It was noted that Bell was \"open to suggestions\" for an ARPANET-wide license.\n\nSpecific features found beneficial were the local processing facilities, [[compiler]]s, [[Text editor|editors]], a [[roff (software)|document preparation system]]<!--Correct link?-->, efficient file system and access control, [[Mount (computing)|mountable]] and unmountable volumes, unified treatment of peripherals as [[Device file system|special files]], integration of the [[Network Control Program|network control program]] (NCP) within the Unix file system, treatment of [[Connection-oriented protocol|network connections]] as special files that can be accessed through standard Unix [[System call|I/O calls]], closing of all files on program exit, and the decision to be \"desirable to minimize the amount of code added to the basic Unix kernel\".\n\n== Branding ==\n{{See also|List of Unix systems}}\n[[File:UNIX-Licence-Plate.JPG|thumb|Promotional [[license plate]] by [[Digital Equipment Corporation]]]]\n[[File:HP-HP9000-C110-Workstation 10.jpg|thumb|[[HP9000]] [[workstation]] running [[HP-UX]], a certified Unix operating system]]\n\nIn October 1993, [[Novell]], the company that owned the rights to the Unix System V source at the time, transferred the [[trademark]]s of Unix to the X/Open Company (now [[The Open Group]]),<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" >{{cite newsgroup |title=The name UNIX is now the property of X/Open |author=Chuck Karish |date=October 12, 1993 |newsgroup=comp.std.unix |message-id=29hug3INN4qt@rodan.UU.NET |url=http://groups.google.com/group/comp.std.unix/msg/c9974cf0022884f8 |access-date=February 21, 2020}}</ref> and in 1995 sold the related business operations to [[Santa Cruz Operation]] (SCO).<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.novell.com/news/press/archive/1995/09/pr95220.html |title=HP, Novell and SCO To Deliver High-Volume UNIX OS With Advanced Network And Enterprise Services |publisher=Novell.com |date=September 20, 1995 |accessdate=November 9, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070123203442/http://www.novell.com/news/press/archive/1995/09/pr95220.html |archivedate=January 23, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Whether Novell also sold the [[copyright]]s to the actual software was the subject of a federal lawsuit in 2006, ''[[SCO v.

Unix systems are characterized by various concepts: the use of [[plain text]] for storing data; a hierarchical [[file system]]; treating devices and certain types of [[inter-process communication]] (IPC) as files; and the use of a large number of [[programming tool|software tools]], small programs that can be strung together through a [[command-line interpreter]] using [[pipeline (Unix)|pipes]], as opposed to using a single monolithic program that includes all of the same functionality.  These concepts are collectively known as the \"[[Unix philosophy]]\".  [[Brian Kernighan]] and [[Rob Pike]] summarize this in ''[[The Unix Programming Environment]]'' as \"the idea that the power of a system comes more from the relationships among programs than from the programs themselves\".<ref>Kernighan, Brian W. Pike, Rob. ''The UNIX Programming Environment.'' 1984. viii</ref>\n\nIn an era when a standard computer consisted of a hard disk for storage and a [[data terminal]] for [[Input/output|input and output]] (I/O), the Unix file model worked quite well, as I/O was generally linear.  In the 1980s, [[non-blocking I/O]] and the set of [[inter-process communication]] mechanisms were augmented with [[Unix domain socket]]s, [[shared memory]], [[message queue]]s, and [[semaphore (programming)|semaphores]], as well as [[network socket]]s to support communication with other hosts. As graphical user interfaces developed, the file model proved inadequate to the task of handling asynchronous events such as those generated by a [[computer mouse|mouse]].\n\nBy the early 1980s, users began seeing Unix as a potential universal operating system, suitable for computers of all sizes.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1983-10/1983_10_BYTE_08-10_UNIX#page/n133/mode/2up | title=The Unix Tutorial / Part 3: Unix in the Microcomputer Marketplace | work=BYTE | date=October 1983 | accessdate=January 30, 2015 | author=Fiedler, Ryan | page=132}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |quote=The best thing about UNIX is its portability.

The kernel provides services to start and stop programs, handles the [[file system]] and other common \"low-level\" tasks that most programs share, and schedules access to avoid conflicts when programs try to access the same resource or device simultaneously.

In 2000, Apple released [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]], also a Unix system, which became the core of the Mac OS X operating system, which was later renamed [[macOS]].<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/OSX_Technology_Overview/SystemTechnology/SystemTechnology.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001067-CH207-BCICAIFJ\n |title       = Loading\n |publisher   = Developer.apple.com\n |accessdate  = August 22, 2012\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://www.webcitation.org/68BcbgbEj?url=http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/OSX_Technology_Overview/SystemTechnology/SystemTechnology.html\n |archivedate = June 5, 2012\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nUnix operating systems are widely used in modern [[Server (computing)|servers]], [[workstation]]s, and [[mobile device]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asymco.com/2010/09/29/unixs-revenge/ |title=Unix's Revenge |publisher=asymco |date=September 29, 2010 |accessdate=November 9, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101109010117/http://www.asymco.com/2010/09/29/unixs-revenge/ |archivedate=November 9, 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Standards ==\n[[File:CDE 2012 on Linux.png|thumb|The [[Common Desktop Environment]] (CDE), part of the [[Common Open Software Environment|COSE initiative]]]]\n\nIn the late 1980s, an open operating system standardization effort now known as [[POSIX]] provided a common baseline for all operating systems; [[IEEE]] based POSIX around the common structure of the major competing variants of the Unix system, publishing the first POSIX standard in 1988. In the early 1990s, a separate but very similar effort was started by an industry consortium, the [[Common Open Software Environment]] (COSE) initiative, which eventually became the [[Single UNIX Specification]] (SUS) administered by [[The Open Group]]. Starting in 1998, the Open Group and IEEE started the [[Austin Group]], to provide a common definition of POSIX and the Single UNIX Specification, which, by 2008, had become the Open Group Base Specification.\n\nIn 1999, in an effort towards compatibility, several Unix system vendors agreed on SVR4's [[Executable and Linkable Format]] (ELF) as the standard for binary and object code files. The common format allows substantial binary compatibility among different Unix systems operating on the same CPU architecture.\n\nThe [[Filesystem Hierarchy Standard]] was created to provide a reference directory layout for Unix-like operating systems; it has mainly been used in Linux.\n\n== Components ==\n{{see also|List of Unix commands}}\n{{Unreferenced|date=January 2017|section}}\n\nThe Unix system is composed of several components that were originally packaged together. By including the development environment, libraries, documents and the portable, modifiable source code for all of these components, in addition to the [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]] of an operating system, Unix was a self-contained software system. This was one of the key reasons it emerged as an important teaching and learning tool and has had such a broad influence.{{according to whom|date=April 2015}}\n\nThe inclusion of these components did not make the system large{{snd}} the original V7 UNIX distribution, consisting of copies of all of the compiled binaries plus all of the source code and documentation occupied less than 10&nbsp;MB and arrived on a single nine-track [[Magnetic tape data storage|magnetic tape]]. The printed documentation, typeset from the online sources, was contained in two volumes.\n\nThe names and filesystem locations of the Unix components have changed substantially across the history of the system. Nonetheless, the V7 implementation is considered by many{{who|date=February 2014}} to have the canonical early structure:\n* ''Kernel''{{snd}} source code in /usr/sys, composed of several sub-components:\n** ''conf''{{snd}} configuration and machine-dependent parts, including boot code\n** ''dev''{{snd}} device drivers for control of hardware (and some pseudo-hardware)\n** ''sys''{{snd}} operating system \"kernel\", handling memory management, process scheduling, system calls, etc.\n** ''h''{{snd}} header files, defining key structures within the system and important system-specific invariables\n* ''Development environment''{{snd}} early versions of Unix contained a development environment sufficient to recreate the entire system from source code:\n** ''cc''{{snd}} [[C (programming language)|C language]] compiler (first appeared in V3 Unix)\n** ''as''{{snd}} machine-language assembler for the machine\n** ''ld''{{snd}} linker, for combining object files\n** ''lib''{{snd}} object-code libraries (installed in /lib or /usr/lib). ''[[libc]]'', the system library with C run-time support, was the primary library, but there have always been additional libraries for things such as mathematical functions (''[[libm]]'') or database access. V7 Unix introduced the first version of the modern \"Standard I/O\" library ''stdio'' as part of the system library. Later implementations increased the number of libraries significantly.\n** ''[[make (software)|make]]''{{snd}} build manager (introduced in [[PWB/UNIX]]), for effectively automating the build process\n** ''include''{{snd}} header files for software development, defining standard interfaces and system invariants\n** ''Other languages''{{snd}} V7 Unix contained a Fortran-77 compiler, a programmable arbitrary-precision calculator (''bc'', ''dc''), and the [[awk]] scripting language; later versions and implementations contain many other language compilers and toolsets. Early BSD releases included [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] tools, and many modern Unix systems also include the [[GNU Compiler Collection]] as well as or instead of a proprietary compiler system.\n** ''Other tools''{{snd}} including an object-code archive manager (''ar''), symbol-table lister (''nm''), compiler-development tools (e.g. ''[[Lex (software)|lex]]'' & ''[[yacc]]''), and debugging tools.\n* ''Commands''{{snd}} Unix makes little distinction between commands (user-level programs) for system operation and maintenance (e.g. ''[[cron]]''), commands of general utility (e.g. ''[[grep]]''), and more general-purpose applications such as the text formatting and typesetting package. Nonetheless, some major categories are:\n** ''[[Bourne shell|sh]]''{{snd}} the \"shell\" programmable [[command-line interpreter]], the primary user interface on Unix before window systems appeared, and even afterward (within a \"command window\").\n** ''Utilities''{{snd}} the core toolkit of the Unix command set, including ''[[cp (Unix)|cp]]'', ''[[ls]]'', ''[[grep]]'', ''[[find (Unix)|find]]'' and many others. Subcategories include:\n*** ''System utilities''{{snd}} administrative tools such as ''[[mkfs]]'', ''[[fsck]]'', and many others.\n*** ''User utilities''{{snd}} environment management tools such as ''passwd'', ''kill'', and others.\n** ''Document formatting''{{snd}} Unix systems were used from the outset for document preparation and typesetting systems, and included many related programs such as ''[[nroff]]'', ''[[troff]]'', ''[[tbl]]'', ''[[eqn (software)|eqn]]'', ''[[refer (software)|refer]]'', and ''[[Pic language|pic]]''. Some modern Unix systems also include packages such as [[TeX]] and [[Ghostscript]].\n** ''Graphics''{{snd}} the ''plot'' subsystem provided facilities for producing simple vector plots in a device-independent format, with device-specific interpreters to display such files. Modern Unix systems also generally include [[X11]] as a standard windowing system and [[GUI]], and many support [[OpenGL]].\n** ''Communications''{{snd}} early Unix systems contained no inter-system communication, but did include the inter-user communication programs ''mail'' and ''write''. V7 introduced the early inter-system communication system [[UUCP]], and systems beginning with BSD release 4.1c included [[TCP/IP]] utilities.\n* ''Documentation''{{snd}} Unix was the first{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} operating system to include all of its documentation online in machine-readable form. The documentation included:\n** ''[[man page|man]]''{{snd}} manual pages for each command, library component, [[system call]], header file, etc.\n** ''doc''{{snd}} longer documents detailing major subsystems, such as the C language and troff\n\n== Impact ==\n{{See also|Unix-like}}\n{{More citations needed|section|date=January 2017}}\n\n[[File:Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie.jpg|thumb|[[Ken Thompson]] and [[Dennis Ritchie]], principal developers of [[Research Unix]]]]\n[[File:Usenix84 1.jpg|thumb|Photo from [[USENIX]] 1984, including [[Dennis Ritchie]] (center)]]\n[[File:Plan 9 from Bell Labs (with acme).png|thumb|[[Plan 9 from Bell Labs]] extends Unix design principles and was developed as a successor to Unix.]]\n\nThe Unix system had a significant impact on other operating systems. It achieved its reputation by its interactivity, by providing the software at a nominal fee for educational use, by running on inexpensive hardware, and by being easy to adapt and move to different machines. Unix was originally written in [[assembly language]], but was soon rewritten in [[C (programming language)|C]], a [[high-level programming language]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Ritchie, Dennis |url=https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/hist.html |title=The Evolution of the Unix Time-sharing System |year=1979 |accessdate=April 30, 2016 |publisher=Bell Labs |quote=Perhaps the most important watershed occurred during 1973, when the operating system kernel was rewritten in C. |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611114353/https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/hist.html |archivedate=June 11, 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Although this followed the lead of [[Multics]] and [[Burroughs large systems|Burroughs]], it was Unix that popularized the idea.\n\nUnix had a drastically simplified file model compared to many contemporary operating systems: treating all kinds of files as simple byte arrays. The file system hierarchy contained machine services and devices (such as [[computer printer|printers]], [[computer terminal|terminals]], or [[disk drive]]s), providing a uniform interface, but at the expense of occasionally requiring additional mechanisms such as [[ioctl]] and mode flags to access features of the hardware that did not fit the simple \"stream of bytes\" model. The [[Plan 9 from Bell Labs|Plan 9]] operating system pushed this model even further and eliminated the need for additional mechanisms.\n\nUnix also popularized the hierarchical file system with arbitrarily nested subdirectories, originally introduced by Multics. Other common operating systems of the era had ways to divide a storage device into multiple directories or sections, but they had a fixed number of levels, often only one level. Several major proprietary operating systems eventually added recursive subdirectory capabilities also patterned after Multics. DEC's [[RSX-11]]M's \"group, user\" hierarchy evolved into [[Virtual Memory System|VMS]] directories, [[CP/M]]'s volumes evolved into [[MS-DOS]] 2.0+ subdirectories, and HP's [[HP Multi-Programming Executive|MPE]] group.account hierarchy and IBM's [[System Support Program|SSP]] and [[OS/400]] library systems were folded into broader POSIX file systems.\n\nMaking the command interpreter an ordinary user-level program, with additional commands provided as separate programs, was another Multics innovation popularized by Unix. The [[Unix shell]] used the same language for interactive commands as for scripting ([[shell script]]s&nbsp;\u2013 there was no separate job control language like IBM's [[Job Control Language|JCL]]). Since the shell and OS commands were \"just another program\", the user could choose (or even write) their own shell. New commands could be added without changing the shell itself. Unix's innovative command-line syntax for creating modular chains of producer-consumer processes ([[pipeline (Unix)|pipelines]]) made a powerful programming paradigm ([[coroutine]]s) widely available. Many later command-line interpreters have been inspired by the Unix shell.\n\nA fundamental simplifying assumption of Unix was its focus on [[newline]]-[[Delimiter|delimited]] text for nearly all file formats. There were no \"binary\" editors in the original version of Unix&nbsp;\u2013 the entire system was configured using textual shell command scripts. The common denominator in the I/O system was the byte&nbsp;\u2013 unlike [[Record-oriented filesystem|\"record-based\" file systems]]. The focus on text for representing nearly everything made Unix pipes especially useful and encouraged the development of simple, general tools that could be easily combined to perform more complicated ''ad hoc'' tasks. The focus on text and bytes made the system far more scalable and portable than other systems. Over time, text-based applications have also proven popular in application areas, such as printing languages ([[PostScript]], [[ODF]]), and at the application layer of the [[Internet Protocol Suite|Internet protocols]], e.g., [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]], [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]], [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]], [[SOAP]], and [[Session Initiation Protocol|SIP]].\n\nUnix popularized a syntax for [[regular expression]]s that found widespread use. The Unix programming interface became the basis for a widely implemented operating system interface standard (POSIX, see above). The [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] soon spread beyond Unix, and is now ubiquitous in systems and applications programming.\n\nEarly Unix developers were important in bringing the concepts of [[Modularity (programming)|modularity]] and [[reusability]] into [[software engineering]] practice, spawning a \"software tools\" movement. Over time, the leading developers of Unix (and programs that ran on it) established a set of cultural norms for developing software, norms which became as important and influential as the technology of Unix itself; this has been termed the [[Unix philosophy]].\n\nThe [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP networking protocols]] were quickly implemented on the Unix versions widely used on relatively inexpensive computers, which contributed to the [[Internet]] explosion of worldwide real-time connectivity, and which formed the basis for implementations on many other platforms.\n\nThe Unix policy of extensive on-line documentation and (for many years) ready access to all system source code raised programmer expectations, and contributed to the launch of the [[free software movement]] in 1983.\n\n=== Free Unix and Unix-like variants ===\n{{See also|Operating system#Unix and Unix-like operating systems}}\n{{Multiple image\n | width = 220\n | direction = vertical\n | image1 = Debian 6.0 Console Login.png\n | image2 = FreeBSD 9.1 Console Login.png\n | footer = Console screenshots of [[Debian]] (top, a popular [[Linux distribution]]) and [[FreeBSD]] (bottom, a popular [[Unix-like]] operating system)\n}}\n\nIn 1983, [[Richard Stallman]] announced the [[GNU]] (short for \"GNU's Not Unix\") project, an ambitious effort to create a [[free software]] [[Unix-like]] system; \"free\" in the sense that everyone who received a copy would be free to use, study, modify, and redistribute it. The GNU project's own kernel development project, [[GNU Hurd]], had not yet produced a working kernel, but in 1991 [[Linus Torvalds]] released the kernel [[Linux kernel|Linux]] as free software under the [[GNU General Public License]]. In addition to their use in the [[GNU]] operating system, many GNU packages&nbsp;\u2013 such as the [[GNU Compiler Collection]] (and the rest of the [[GNU toolchain]]), the [[glibc|GNU C library]] and the [[Coreutils|GNU core utilities]]&nbsp;\u2013 have gone on to play central roles in other free Unix systems as well.\n\n[[Linux distribution]]s, consisting of the Linux kernel and large collections of compatible software have become popular both with individual users and in business. Popular distributions include [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]], [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]], [[SUSE Linux|SUSE Linux Enterprise]], [[openSUSE]], [[Debian|Debian GNU/Linux]], [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]], [[Linux Mint]], [[Mandriva Linux]], [[Slackware Linux]], [[Arch Linux]] and [[Gentoo Linux|Gentoo]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major| title=Distrowatch: Top Ten Distributions}}</ref>\n\nA free derivative of [[BSD]] Unix, [[386BSD]], was released in 1992 and led to the [[NetBSD]] and [[FreeBSD]] projects. With the 1994 settlement of a lawsuit brought against the University of California and Berkeley Software Design Inc. (''[[USL v. BSDi]]'') by [[Unix System Laboratories]], it was clarified that Berkeley had the right to distribute BSD Unix for free if it so desired. Since then, BSD Unix has been developed in several different product branches, including [[OpenBSD]] and [[DragonFly BSD]].\n\nLinux and BSD are increasingly filling the market needs traditionally served by proprietary Unix operating systems, as well as expanding into new markets such as the consumer desktop and mobile and embedded devices. Because of the modular design of the Unix model, sharing components is relatively common; consequently, most or all Unix and Unix-like systems include at least some BSD code, and some systems also include GNU utilities in their distributions.\n\nIn a 1999 interview, Dennis Ritchie voiced his opinion that Linux and BSD operating systems are a continuation of the basis of the Unix design, and are derivatives of Unix:<ref name=\"Interview_1999\">{{cite web|author=Benet, Manuel|url=http://www.linuxfocus.org/English/July1999/article79.html|title=Interview With Dennis M.

Linux seems to be the among the healthiest of the direct Unix derivatives, though there are also the various BSD systems as well as the more official offerings from the workstation and mainframe manufacturers.}}\n\nIn the same interview, he states that he views both Unix and Linux as \"the continuation of ideas that were started by Ken and me and many others, many years ago\".<ref name=\"Interview_1999\" />\n\n[[OpenSolaris]] was the open-source counterpart to [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] developed by [[Sun Microsystems]], which included a [[CDDL]]-licensed kernel and a primarily [[GNU]] userland. However, [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] discontinued the project upon their acquisition of Sun, which prompted a group of former Sun employees and members of the OpenSolaris community to fork OpenSolaris into the [[illumos]] kernel. As of 2014, illumos remains the only active open-source System V derivative.\n\n=== ARPANET ===\nIn May 1975, RFC 681 described the development of ''Network Unix'' by the Center for Advanced Computation at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]]. The system was said to \"present several interesting capabilities as an [[ARPANET]] mini-host\". At the time Unix required a license from [[Bell Laboratories]] that at $20,000(US) was very expensive for non-[[university]] users, while an educational license cost just $150. It was noted that Bell was \"open to suggestions\" for an ARPANET-wide license.\n\nSpecific features found beneficial were the local processing facilities, [[compiler]]s, [[Text editor|editors]], a [[roff (software)|document preparation system]]<!--Correct link?-->, efficient file system and access control, [[Mount (computing)|mountable]] and unmountable volumes, unified treatment of peripherals as [[Device file system|special files]], integration of the [[Network Control Program|network control program]] (NCP) within the Unix file system, treatment of [[Connection-oriented protocol|network connections]] as special files that can be accessed through standard Unix [[System call|I/O calls]], closing of all files on program exit, and the decision to be \"desirable to minimize the amount of code added to the basic Unix kernel\".\n\n== Branding ==\n{{See also|List of Unix systems}}\n[[File:UNIX-Licence-Plate.JPG|thumb|Promotional [[license plate]] by [[Digital Equipment Corporation]]]]\n[[File:HP-HP9000-C110-Workstation 10.jpg|thumb|[[HP9000]] [[workstation]] running [[HP-UX]], a certified Unix operating system]]\n\nIn October 1993, [[Novell]], the company that owned the rights to the Unix System V source at the time, transferred the [[trademark]]s of Unix to the X/Open Company (now [[The Open Group]]),<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" >{{cite newsgroup |title=The name UNIX is now the property of X/Open |author=Chuck Karish |date=October 12, 1993 |newsgroup=comp.std.unix |message-id=29hug3INN4qt@rodan.UU.NET |url=http://groups.google.com/group/comp.std.unix/msg/c9974cf0022884f8 |access-date=February 21, 2020}}</ref> and in 1995 sold the related business operations to [[Santa Cruz Operation]] (SCO).<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.novell.com/news/press/archive/1995/09/pr95220.html |title=HP, Novell and SCO To Deliver High-Volume UNIX OS With Advanced Network And Enterprise Services |publisher=Novell.com |date=September 20, 1995 |accessdate=November 9, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070123203442/http://www.novell.com/news/press/archive/1995/09/pr95220.html |archivedate=January 23, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Whether Novell also sold the [[copyright]]s to the actual software was the subject of a federal lawsuit in 2006, ''[[SCO v.

Most common is the conventional ''Unixes'', but ''Unices'', treating Unix as a [[Latin]] noun of the [[Latin declension#Third declension (i)|third declension]], is also popular. The pseudo-[[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] plural form ''Unixen'' is not common, although occasionally seen. [[Sun Microsystems]], developer of the Solaris variant, has asserted that the term ''Unix'' is itself plural, referencing its many implementations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cse.unl.edu/~witty/class/csce351/howto/history_of_solaris.pdf|title=History of Solaris|quote=UNIX is plural.
