AnneFrank.org, 31 March 2015</ref> was a [[History of the Jews in Germany|German]]-[[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Dutch]] diarist of [[Jews|Jewish]] origin. One of the most discussed Jewish victims of [[the Holocaust]], she gained fame posthumously with the publication of ''[[The Diary of a Young Girl]]'' (originally {{lang|nl|Het Achterhuis}} in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]; {{lang-en|The Secret Annex}}), in which she documents her life in hiding from 1942 to 1944, during the [[German occupation of the Netherlands]] in [[World War II]]. It is one of the world's best known books and has been the basis for several plays and films.\n\nBorn in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]], she lived most of her life in or near [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]], having moved there with her family at the age of four and a half when the [[Nazi]]s gained control over Germany. Born a German national, she lost her citizenship in 1941 and thus became [[statelessness|stateless]]. By May 1940, the Franks were trapped in Amsterdam by the German occupation of the Netherlands. As [[History of the Jews during World War II|persecutions of the Jewish population]] increased in July 1942, the Franks went into hiding in some [[Anne Frank House|concealed rooms]] behind a bookcase in the building where Anne's father, [[Otto Frank]], worked. From then until the family's arrest by the [[Gestapo]] in August 1944, she kept a diary she had received as a birthday present, and wrote in it regularly. Following their arrest, the Franks were transported to [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]]. In October or November 1944, Anne and her sister, [[Margot Frank|Margot]], were transferred from [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] to [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]], where they died (probably of [[typhus]]) a few months later. They were originally estimated by the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] to have died in March, with Dutch authorities setting 31 March as their official date of death, but research by the [[Anne Frank House]] in 2015 suggests it is more likely that they died in February.<ref name=\"DeathResearch\" />\n\nOtto, the only survivor of the Franks, returned to Amsterdam after the war to find that her diary had been saved by his secretary, [[Miep Gies]], and his efforts led to its publication in 1947. It was translated from its original Dutch version and first published in English in 1952 as ''The Diary of a Young Girl'', and has since been translated into over 70 languages.\n\n== Early life ==\nFrank was born Annelies{{sfn|Anne Frank Fonds}} or Anneliese{{sfn|Barnouw|Van Der Stroom|2003|pp=3, 17}} Marie Frank on 12 June 1929 at the [[Maingau Red Cross Clinic]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rotkreuzkliniken.de/drk_schwesternschaft_bad_homburg-maingau.html |title=Geschichte |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher= Frankfurt Red Cross Clinics |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> in [[Frankfurt]], Germany, to [[Edith Frank|Edith]] ({{n\u00e9e|Holl\u00e4nder}}) and [[Otto Frank|Otto Heinrich Frank]].

This hiding place became known as the ''Achterhuis'' (translated into \"Secret Annex\" in English editions of the diary). Their apartment was left in a state of disarray to create the impression that they had left suddenly, and Otto left a note that hinted they were going to Switzerland. The need for secrecy forced them to leave behind Anne's cat, Moortje. As Jews were not allowed to use public transport, they walked several kilometres from their home.{{sfn|Lee|2000|pp=105\u2013106}} The door to the ''Achterhuis'' was later covered by a bookcase to ensure it remained undiscovered.{{sfn|Westra et al.|2004|pp=45, 107\u2013187}}\n\n[[Victor Kugler]], [[Johannes Kleiman]], [[Miep Gies]], and [[Bep Voskuijl]] were the only employees who knew of the people in hiding.

The only connection between the outside world and the occupants of the house, they kept the occupants informed of war news and political developments. They catered to all of their needs, ensured their safety, and supplied them with food, a task that grew more difficult with the passage of time. Frank wrote of their dedication and of their efforts to boost morale within the household during the most dangerous of times.

She regarded Hermann van Pels and Fritz Pfeffer as selfish, particularly in regard to the amount of food they consumed.{{sfn|Lee|2000|p=117}} Some time later, after first dismissing the shy and awkward Peter van Pels, she recognized a kinship with him and the two entered a romance. She received her first kiss from him, but her infatuation with him began to wane as she questioned whether her feelings for him were genuine, or resulted from their shared confinement.{{sfn|Westra et al.|2004|p=191}} Anne Frank formed a close bond with each of the helpers, and Otto Frank later recalled that she had anticipated their daily visits with impatient enthusiasm. He observed that Anne's closest friendship was with Bep Voskuijl, \"the young typist&nbsp;... the two of them often stood whispering in the corner.\"{{sfn|Lee|2000|p=119}}\n\n=== The young diarist ===\nIn her writing, Frank examined her relationships with the members of her family, and the strong differences in each of their personalities. She considered herself to be closest emotionally to her father, who later commented, \"I got on better with Anne than with Margot, who was more attached to her mother. The reason for that may have been that Margot rarely showed her feelings and didn't need as much support because she didn't suffer from mood swings as much as Anne did.\"{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999||p=203}} The Frank sisters formed a closer relationship than had existed before they went into hiding, although Anne sometimes expressed jealousy towards Margot, particularly when members of the household criticized Anne for lacking Margot's gentle and placid nature. As Anne began to mature, the sisters were able to confide in each other. In her entry of 12 January 1944, Frank wrote, \"Margot's much nicer&nbsp;... She's not nearly so catty these days and is becoming a real friend. She no longer thinks of me as a little baby who doesn't count.\"{{sfn|Frank|1995|p=167}}\n\n[[File:Amsterdam Panaroma.jpg|thumb|alt=Taken from the top of the Westerkerk church, this image shows the Prinsengracht canal and the rooftops of the buildings in the neighborhood|The [[Anne Frank House|Secret Annex]] with its light-coloured walls and orange roof (bottom) and the [[Anne Frank tree]] in the garden behind the house (bottom right), seen from the [[Westerkerk]] in 2004]]\n\nFrank frequently wrote of her difficult relationship with her mother, and of her ambivalence towards her. On 7 November 1942 she described her \"contempt\" for her mother and her inability to \"confront her with her carelessness, her sarcasm and her hard-heartedness,\" before concluding, \"She's not a mother to me.\"{{sfn|Frank|1995|p=63}} Later, as she revised her diary, Frank felt ashamed of her harsh attitude, writing: \"Anne, is it really you who mentioned hate, oh Anne, how could you?\"{{sfn|Frank|1995|p=157}} She came to understand that their differences resulted from misunderstandings that were as much her fault as her mother's, and saw that she had added unnecessarily to her mother's suffering. With this realization, Frank began to treat her mother with a degree of tolerance and respect.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=204}}\n\nThe Frank sisters each hoped to return to school as soon as they were able, and continued with their studies while in hiding. Margot took a [[shorthand]] [[correspondence course|course by correspondence]] in Bep Voskuijl's name and received high marks. Most of Anne's time was spent reading and studying, and she regularly wrote and edited (after March 1944) her diary entries. In addition to providing a narrative of events as they occurred, she wrote about her feelings, beliefs, dreams and ambitions, subjects she felt she could not discuss with anyone. As her confidence in her writing grew, and as she began to mature, she wrote of more abstract subjects such as her belief in God, and how she defined human nature.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=194}}\n\nFrank aspired to become a journalist, writing in her diary on Wednesday, 5 April 1944:\n{{quote\n| I finally realized that I must do my schoolwork to keep from being ignorant, to get on in life, to become a journalist, because that's what I want! I know I can write&nbsp;..., but it remains to be seen whether I really have talent&nbsp;...\n\nAnd if I don't have the talent to write books or newspaper articles, I can always write for myself. But I want to achieve more than that. I can't imagine living like Mother, Mrs. van Daan and all the women who go about their work and are then forgotten.

On 5 August they were transferred to the Huis van Bewaring (House of Detention), an overcrowded prison on the Weteringschans. Two days later they were transported to the [[Westerbork transit camp]], through which by that time more than 100,000 Jews, mostly Dutch and German, had passed. Having been arrested in hiding, they were considered criminals and sent to the Punishment Barracks for [[hard labor|hard labour]].{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=233}}\n\nVictor Kugler and Johannes Kleiman were arrested and jailed at the penal camp for enemies of the regime at [[Amersfoort]].

They returned to the ''Achterhuis'' the following day, and found Anne's papers strewn on the floor. They collected them, as well as several family photograph albums, and Gies resolved to return them to Anne after the war. On 7 August 1944, Gies attempted to facilitate the release of the prisoners by confronting Silberbauer and offering him money to intervene, but he refused.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=279}}\n\nAlthough there have been persistent claims of betrayal by an informant, the source of the information that led the authorities to raid the ''Achterhuis'' has never been identified. Night watchman Martin Sleegers and an unidentified police officer investigated a burglary at the premises in April 1944 and came across the bookcase concealing the secret door. Tonny Ahlers, a member of the [[National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands]] (NSB), was suspected of being the informant by [[Carol Ann Lee]], biographer of Otto Frank. Another suspect is stockroom manager Willem van Maaren. The Annex occupants did not trust him, as he seemed inquisitive regarding people entering the stockroom after hours. He once unexpectedly asked the employees whether there had previously been a Mr. Frank at the office. Lena Hartog was suspected of being the informant by Anne Frank's biographer [[Melissa M\u00fcller]]. Several of these suspects knew one another and might have worked in collaboration.

Those deemed able to work were admitted into the camp, and those deemed unfit for labour were immediately killed. Of the 1,019 passengers, 549\u2014including all children younger than 15\u2014were sent directly to the [[Gas chamber#Nazi Germany|gas chambers]]. Anne Frank, who had turned 15 three months earlier, was one of the youngest people spared from her transport. She was soon made aware that most people were gassed upon arrival and never learned that the entire group from the ''Achterhuis'' had survived this selection. She reasoned that her father, in his mid-fifties and not particularly robust, had been killed immediately after they were separated.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|pp=246\u2013247}}\n\nWith the other women and girls not selected for immediate death, Frank was forced to strip naked to be disinfected, had her head shaved, and was [[Identification in Nazi camps|tattooed with an identifying number]] on her arm. By day, the women were used as slave labour and Frank was forced to haul rocks and dig rolls of sod; by night, they were crammed into overcrowded barracks. Some witnesses later testified Frank became withdrawn and tearful when she saw children being led to the gas chambers; others reported that more often she displayed strength and courage. Her gregarious and confident nature allowed her to obtain extra bread [[Rationing|rations]] for her mother, sister, and herself. Disease was rampant; before long, Frank's skin became badly infected by [[scabies]]. The Frank sisters were moved into an infirmary, which was in a state of constant darkness and infested with rats and mice. Edith Frank stopped eating, saving every morsel of food for her daughters and passing her rations to them through a hole she made at the bottom of the infirmary wall.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|pp=248\u2013251}}\n\n[[File:Anne frank memorial bergen belsen.jpg|thumb|alt=A Memorial for Margot and Anne Frank shows a Star of David and the full names, birthdates, and year of death of each of the sisters, in white lettering on a large black stone.

Bloeme Evers-Emden was scheduled to be on this transport, but Anne was prohibited from going because she had developed scabies, and her mother and sister opted to stay with her. Bloeme went on without them.{{sfn|Laeredt|1995}}\n\nOn 28 October, selections began for women to be relocated to [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]]. More than 8,000 women, including Anne and Margot Frank, and Auguste van Pels, were transported. Edith Frank was left behind and died of starvation.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=252}} Tents were erected at Bergen-Belsen to accommodate the influx of prisoners, and as the population rose, the death toll due to disease increased rapidly. Frank was briefly reunited with two friends, [[Hanneli Goslar]] and [[Nanette Blitz]], who were confined in another section of the camp. Goslar and Blitz survived the war, and discussed the brief conversations they had conducted with Frank through a fence. Blitz described Anne as bald, emaciated, and shivering. Goslar noted Auguste van Pels was with Anne and Margot Frank, and was caring for Margot, who was severely ill. Neither of them saw Margot, as she was too weak to leave her bunk. Anne told Blitz and Goslar she believed her parents were dead, and for that reason she did not wish to live any longer. Goslar later estimated their meetings had taken place in late January or early February 1945.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=255}}\n\nIn early 1945, a [[typhus]] epidemic spread through the camp, killing 17,000 prisoners.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=261}} Other diseases, including [[typhoid fever]], were rampant.{{sfn|Gedenkst\u00e4tten Bergen-Belsen}} Due to these chaotic conditions, it is not possible to determine the specific cause of Anne's death; however, there is evidence that she died from the epidemic.

After the war ended, he returned to Amsterdam in June 1945 where he was sheltered by Jan and Miep Gies as he attempted to locate his family. He learned of the death of his wife, Edith, in Auschwitz, but remained hopeful that his daughters had survived. After several weeks, he discovered Margot and Anne had also died. He attempted to determine the fates of his daughters' friends and learned many had been murdered. [[Sanne Ledermann]], often mentioned in Anne's diary, had been gassed along with her parents; her sister, Barbara, a close friend of Margot's, had survived.{{sfn|Lee|2000|pp=211\u2013212}} Several of the Frank sisters' school friends had survived, as had the extended families of Otto and Edith Frank, as they had fled Germany during the mid-1930s, with individual family members settling in Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|2013|pp=39, 48\u201349}}\n\n== ''The Diary of a Young Girl'' ==\n{{main|The Diary of a Young Girl}}\n\n=== Publication ===\n[[File:Het Achterhuis (Diary of Anne Frank) - front cover, first edition.jpg|thumb|upright|{{lang|nl|Het Achterhuis}}, the first Dutch edition of Anne Frank's diary, published in 1947, later translated into English as ''[[The Diary of a Young Girl]]''.]]\n\nIn July 1945, after the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] confirmed the deaths of the Frank sisters, Miep Gies gave Otto Frank the diary and a bundle of loose notes that she had saved in the hope of returning them to Anne. Otto Frank later commented that he had not realized Anne had kept such an accurate and well-written record of their time in hiding. In his memoir, he described the painful process of reading the diary, recognizing the events described and recalling that he had already heard some of the more amusing episodes read aloud by his daughter. He saw for the first time the more private side of his daughter and those sections of the diary she had not discussed with anyone, noting, \"For me it was a revelation&nbsp;... I had no idea of the depth of her thoughts and feelings&nbsp;...

She candidly described her life, her family and companions, and their situation, while beginning to recognize her ambition to write fiction for publication. In March 1944, she heard a radio broadcast by [[Gerrit Bolkestein]]\u2014a member of the Dutch [[government in exile]], based in [[London]]\u2014who said that when the war ended, he would create a public record of the Dutch people's oppression under German occupation.{{sfn|Frank|1995|p=242}} He mentioned the publication of letters and diaries, and Frank decided to submit her work when the time came. She began editing her writing, removing some sections and rewriting others, with a view to publication. Her original notebook was supplemented by additional notebooks and loose-leaf sheets of paper. She created pseudonyms for the members of the household and the helpers. The van Pels family became Hermann, Petronella, and Peter van Daan, and Fritz Pfeffer became Albert D\u00fcssell. In this edited version, she addressed each entry to \"Kitty,\" a fictional character in [[Cissy van Marxveldt]]'s {{lang|nl|[[Joop ter Heul]]}} novels that Anne enjoyed reading. Otto Frank used her original diary, known as \"version A\", and her edited version, known as \"version B\", to produce the first version for publication. Although he restored the true identities of his own family, he retained all of the other pseudonyms.{{sfn|Prose|2009|p=75}}\n\nOtto Frank gave the diary to the historian [[Annie Romein-Verschoor]], who tried unsuccessfully to have it published. She then gave it to her husband [[Jan Romein]], who wrote an article about it, titled {{lang|nl|\"Kinderstem\"}} (\"A Child's Voice\"), which was published in the newspaper {{lang|nl|[[Het Parool]]}} on 3 April 1946. He wrote that the diary \"stammered out in a child's voice, embodies all the hideousness of fascism, more so than all the evidence at [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg]] put together.\"{{sfn|Romein}} His article attracted attention from publishers, and the diary was published in the Netherlands as {{lang|nl|Het Achterhuis}} (''The Annex'') in 1947,{{sfn|Lee|2000|p=223}} followed by five more printings by 1950.{{sfn|Prose|2009|p=80}}\n\nIt was first published in Germany and France in 1950, and after being rejected by several publishers, was first published in the United Kingdom in 1952. The first American edition, published in 1952 under the title ''[[The Diary of a Young Girl|Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl]]'', was positively reviewed. The book was successful in France, Germany, and the United States, but in the United Kingdom it failed to attract an audience and by 1953 was out of print. Its most noteworthy success was in Japan, where it received critical acclaim and sold more than 100,000 copies in its first edition. In Japan, Anne Frank quickly was identified as an important cultural figure who represented the destruction of youth during the war.{{sfn|Lee|2000|p=225}}\n\nA play by [[Albert Hackett|Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett]] based upon the diary premiered in New York City on 5 October 1955, and later won a [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]]. It was followed by the film ''[[The Diary of Anne Frank (1959 film)|The Diary of Anne Frank]]'' (1959), which was a critical and commercial success. Biographer [[Melissa M\u00fcller]] later wrote that the dramatization had \"contributed greatly to the romanticizing, sentimentalizing and universalizing of Anne's story.\"{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=276}} Over the years the popularity of the diary grew, and in many schools, particularly in the United States, it was included as part of the curriculum, introducing Anne Frank to new generations of readers.{{sfn|Prose|2009|pp=253\u2013254}}\n\nIn 1986 the [[Dutch Institute for War Documentation]] published the \"Critical Edition\" of the diary.

The missing diary entries contain critical remarks by Anne Frank about her parents' strained marriage and discuss Frank's lack of affection for her mother.{{sfn|Blumenthal|1998}} Some controversy ensued when Suijk claimed publishing rights over the five pages; he intended to sell them to raise money for his foundation. The Netherlands Institute for War Documentation, the formal owner of the manuscript, demanded the pages be handed over. In 2000 the [[Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science]] agreed to donate US$300,000 to Suijk's foundation, and the pages were returned in 2001.

Commenting on Anne Frank's writing style, the dramatist [[Meyer Levin]] commended Frank for \"sustaining the tension of a well-constructed novel\",{{sfn|Levin|1952}} and was so impressed by the quality of her work that he collaborated with Otto Frank on a dramatization of the diary shortly after its publication.{{sfn|Michaelsen|1997}} Levin became obsessed with Anne Frank, which he wrote about in his autobiography ''The Obsession''. The poet [[John Berryman]] called the book a unique depiction, not merely of adolescence but of the \"conversion of a child into a person as it is happening in a precise, confident, economical style stunning in its honesty\".{{sfn|Berryman|2000|p=78}}\n\nIn her introduction to the diary's first American edition, [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] described it as \"one of the wisest and most moving commentaries on war and its impact on human beings that I have ever read.\"{{sfn|Rosow|1996|p=156}} [[John F. Kennedy]] discussed Anne Frank in a 1961 speech, and said, \"Of all the multitudes who throughout history have spoken for human dignity in times of great suffering and loss, no voice is more compelling than that of Anne Frank.\"{{sfn|Westra et al.|2004|p=242}}<ref>{{cite news|title=Kennedy Says Anne Frank's Gift to World Will Survive Her Enemies|url=http://www.jta.org/1961/09/22/archive/kennedy-says-anne-franks-gift-to-world-will-survive-her-enemies|accessdate=27 April 2014|newspaper=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|date=21 September 1961}}</ref> In the same year, the Soviet writer [[Ilya Ehrenburg]] wrote of her: \"one voice speaks for six million\u2014the voice not of a sage or a poet but of an ordinary little girl.\"{{sfn|Graver}}\n\nAs Anne Frank's stature as both a writer and humanist has grown, she has been discussed specifically as a symbol of [[the Holocaust]] and more broadly as a representative of persecution.{{sfn|Feldman|2005}} [[Hillary Clinton]], in her acceptance speech for an [[Elie Wiesel|Elie Wiesel Humanitarian Award]] in 1994, read from Anne Frank's diary and spoke of her \"awakening us to the folly of indifference and the terrible toll it takes on our young,\" which Clinton related to contemporary events in Sarajevo, Somalia and Rwanda.{{sfn|Clinton|1994}} After receiving a humanitarian award from the Anne Frank Foundation in 1994, [[Nelson Mandela]] addressed a crowd in [[Johannesburg]], saying he had read Anne Frank's diary while in prison and \"derived much encouragement from it.\" He likened her struggle against Nazism to his struggle against [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid]], drawing a parallel between the two philosophies: \"Because these beliefs are patently false, and because they were, and will always be, challenged by the likes of Anne Frank, they are bound to fail.\"{{sfn|Mandela|1994}} Also in 1994, [[V\u00e1clav Havel]] said \"Anne Frank's legacy is very much alive and it can address us fully\" in relation to the political and social changes occurring at the time in former Eastern Bloc countries.{{sfn|Westra et al.|2004|p=242}}\n\n[[Primo Levi]] suggested Anne Frank is frequently identified as a single representative of the millions of people who suffered and died as she did because \"One single Anne Frank moves us more than the countless others who suffered just as she did but whose faces have remained in the shadows. Perhaps it is better that way; if we were capable of taking in all the suffering of all those people, we would not be able to live.\"{{sfn|Westra et al.|2004|p=242}} In her closing message in M\u00fcller's biography of Anne Frank, Miep Gies expressed a similar thought, though she attempted to dispel what she felt was a growing misconception that \"Anne symbolises the six million victims of the Holocaust\", writing: \"Anne's life and death were her own individual fate, an individual fate that happened six million times over. Anne cannot, and should not, stand for the many individuals whom the Nazis robbed of their lives&nbsp;... But her fate helps us grasp the immense loss the world suffered because of the Holocaust.\"{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=305}}\n\nOtto Frank spent the remainder of his life as custodian of his daughter's legacy, saying, \"It's a strange role. In the normal family relationship, it is the child of the famous parent who has the honour and the burden of continuing the task. In my case the role is reversed.\" He recalled his publisher's explaining why he thought the diary has been so widely read, with the comment, \"he said that the diary encompasses so many areas of life that each reader can find something that moves him personally\".{{sfn|Lee|2000|pp=222\u201333}} Simon Wiesenthal expressed a similar sentiment when he said that the diary had raised more widespread awareness of the Holocaust than had been achieved during the [[Nuremberg Trials]], because \"people identified with this child. This was the impact of the Holocaust, this was a family like my family, like your family and so you could understand this.\"{{sfn|Stichting, \"Simon Wiesenthal\"}}\n\nIn June 1999, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine published a special edition titled \"[[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century]]\". Anne Frank was selected as one of the \"Heroes & Icons\", and the writer, Roger Rosenblatt, described her legacy with the comment, \"The passions the book ignites suggest that everyone owns Anne Frank, that she has risen above the Holocaust, Judaism, girlhood and even goodness and become a totemic figure of the modern world\u2014the moral individual mind beset by the machinery of destruction, insisting on the right to live and question and hope for the future of human beings.\" He notes that while her courage and pragmatism are admired, her ability to analyse herself and the quality of her writing are the key components of her appeal. He writes, \"The reason for her immortality was basically literary. She was an extraordinarily good writer, for any age, and the quality of her work seemed a direct result of a ruthlessly honest disposition.\"{{sfn|Rosenblatt|1999}}\n\n=== Denials of authenticity and legal action ===\nAfter the diary became widely known in the late 1950s, various allegations against the veracity of the diary and/or its contents appeared, with the earliest published criticisms occurring in Sweden and Norway.{{sfn|Prose|2009|p=241}}\n\nIn 1957, ''{{lang|sv|Fria ord}}'' (\"Free Words\"), the magazine of the Swedish [[neofascist]] organization [[National League of Sweden]], published an article by Danish author and critic Harald Nielsen, who had previously written antisemitic articles about the Danish-Jewish author [[Georg Brandes]].{{sfn|Frank|Holmer|2005|p=340}} Among other things, the article claimed that the diary had been written by Meyer Levin.{{sfn|Stichting, \"Authenticity of the Diary\"}}\n\nIn 1958, at a performance of ''The Diary of Anne Frank'' in Vienna, [[Simon Wiesenthal]] was challenged by a group of protesters who asserted that Anne Frank had never existed, and who challenged Wiesenthal to prove her existence by finding the man who had arrested her. Wiesenthal indeed began searching for [[Karl Silberbauer]] and found him in 1963. When interviewed, Silberbauer admitted his role, and identified Anne Frank from a photograph as one of the people arrested. Silberbauer provided a full account of events, even recalling emptying a briefcase full of papers onto the floor. His statement corroborated the version of events that had previously been presented by witnesses such as Otto Frank.{{sfn|Lee|2000|pp=241\u2013246}}\n\nIn 1959, Otto Frank took legal action in [[L\u00fcbeck]] against Lothar Stielau, a school teacher and former [[Hitler Youth]] member who published a school paper that described the diary as \"a forgery\". The complaint was extended to include Heinrich Buddegerg, who wrote a letter in support of Stielau, which was published in a L\u00fcbeck newspaper. The court examined the diary in 1960 and authenticated the handwriting as matching that in letters known to have been written by Anne Frank. They declared the diary to be genuine. Stielau recanted his earlier statement, and Otto Frank did not pursue the case any further.{{sfn|Stichting, \"Authenticity of the Diary\"}}\n\nIn 1976, Otto Frank took action against Heinz Roth of Frankfurt, who published pamphlets stating that the diary was \"a forgery\". The judge ruled that if Roth  was to publish any further statements he would be subjected to a fine of 500,000 German marks and a six-month jail sentence. Roth appealed against the court's decision. He died in 1978, and after a year his appeal was rejected.{{sfn|Stichting, \"Authenticity of the Diary\"}}\n\nOtto Frank mounted a lawsuit in 1976 against Ernst R\u00f6mer, who distributed a pamphlet titled \"The Diary of Anne Frank, Bestseller, A Lie\". When a man named Edgar Geiss distributed the same pamphlet in the courtroom, he too was prosecuted. R\u00f6mer was fined 1,500 Deutschmarks,{{sfn|Stichting, \"Authenticity of the Diary\"}} and Geiss was sentenced to six months' imprisonment. The sentence of Geiss was reduced on appeal, and the case was eventually dropped following a subsequent appeal because the time limit for filing a libel case had expired.{{sfn|Stichting, \"Legal rulings\"}}\n\nWith Otto Frank's death in 1980, the original diary, including letters and loose sheets, was willed to the Dutch Institute for War Documentation,{{sfn|Lee|2000|p=233}} which commissioned a forensic study of the diary through the Netherlands Ministry of Justice in 1986. They examined the handwriting against known examples and found that they matched. They determined that the paper, glue, and ink were readily available during the time the diary was said to have been written. They concluded that the diary is authentic, and their findings were published in what has become known as the \"Critical Edition\" of the diary.{{sfn|Prose|2009|pp=247\u2013248}} In 1990, the Hamburg Regional Court confirmed the diary's authenticity.{{sfn|Frank|1989|p=102}}\n\nIn 1991, [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]] [[Robert Faurisson]] and [[Siegfried Verbeke]] produced a booklet titled \"The Diary of Anne Frank: A Critical Approach\", in which they revived the allegation that Otto Frank wrote the diary. Purported evidence, as before, included several contradictions in the diary, that the prose style and handwriting were not those of a teenager, and that hiding in the ''Achterhuis'' would have been impossible.{{sfn|Faurisson|2000}}{{sfn|Barnouw|Van Der Stroom|2003|pp=93\u201396}} In 1993, the [[Anne Frank House]] in Amsterdam and the Anne Frank Fonds in Basel filed a civil lawsuit to prohibit further distribution of Faurisson and Verbeke's booklet in the Netherlands. In 1998, the Amsterdam District Court ruled in favour of the claimants, forbade any further denial of the authenticity of the diary and unsolicited distribution of publications to that effect, and imposed a penalty of 25,000 guilders per infringement.{{sfn|Stichting, \"Ten Questions\"}}\n\n=== Unabridged version ===\n<!-- DO NOT INSERT MATERIAL THAT IS NOT IN THE O'TOOLE SOURCE WITHOUT ADDING A RELIABLE THIRD PARTY SOURCE THAT *DOES* SUPPORT IT! --> \nAn unabridged edition of Anne Frank's work was published in 1995.{{sfn|Boretz|1995}} This version included Anne's description of her exploration of her own genitalia and her puzzlement regarding sex and childbirth, a passage that had previously been edited out by Otto Frank.{{sfn|O'Toole|2013}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:AnneFrankMuseumLine.jpg|thumb|People waiting in line in front of the Anne Frank House entrance in Amsterdam]]\n\nOn 3 May 1957, a group of citizens, including Otto Frank, established the Anne Frank Stichting in an effort to rescue the Prinsengracht building from demolition and to make it accessible to the public. The [[Anne Frank House]] opened on 3 May 1960. It consists of the Opekta warehouse and offices and the ''{{lang|nl|Achterhuis}}'', all unfurnished so that visitors can walk freely through the rooms. Some personal relics of the former occupants remain, such as movie star photographs glued by Anne to a wall, a section of wallpaper on which Otto Frank marked the height of his growing daughters, and a map on the wall where he recorded the advance of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]], all now protected behind [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|acrylic glass]]. From the small room which was once home to Peter van Pels, a walkway connects the building to its neighbours, also purchased by the Foundation. These other buildings are used to house the diary, as well as rotating exhibits that chronicle aspects of the Holocaust and more contemporary examinations of racial intolerance around the world. One of Amsterdam's main tourist attractions, it received a record 965,000 visitors in 2005. The House provides information via the internet and offers exhibitions that in 2005 travelled to 32 countries in Europe, Asia, North America, and South America.{{sfn|Anne Frank House Annual Report|2005}}\n\n[[File:Anne Frank M01.JPG|thumb|left|upright|alt=A bronze statue of a smiling Anne Frank, wearing a short dress and standing with her arms behind her back, sits upon a stone [[plinth]] with a [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] reading \"Anne Frank 1929\u20131945\". The statue is in a small square, and behind it is a brick building with two large windows, and a bicycle. The statue stands between the two windows.|Statue of Anne Frank, by [[Mari Andriessen]], outside the [[Westerkerk]] in Amsterdam]]\n\nIn 1963, Otto Frank and his second wife, [[Elfriede Geiringer-Markovits]], set up the Anne Frank Fonds as a [[Charitable organization|charitable foundation]], based in [[Basel]], Switzerland. Upon his death, Otto willed the diary's copyright to the Fonds, on the provision that the first 80,000 [[Swiss franc]]s in income each year was to be distributed to his heirs. The Anne Frank Fonds represents the Frank family. It administers the rights, \u00abinter alia\u00bb, to the writings of Anne and Otto Frank and to the letters of the Frank family. It is the owner of the rights to translations, editions, compilations, and authorised books about Anne Frank and her family. The Fonds aims to educate young people against racism, and loaned some of Anne Frank's papers to the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] in Washington for an exhibition in 2003. Its annual report that year outlined its efforts to contribute on a global level, with support for projects in Germany, Israel, India, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.{{sfn|Anne Frank-Fonds Annual Report|2003}}\n\nIn 1997, the [[Anne Frank Educational Centre (Frankfurt)|Anne Frank Educational Centre]] (''{{lang|de|Jugendbegegnungsst\u00e4tte Anne Frank}}'') was opened in the [[Dornbusch (Frankfurt am Main)|Dornbusch]] neighbourhood of Frankfurt, where Frank lived with her family until 1934. The Centre is \"a place where both young people and adults can learn about the history of National Socialism and discuss its relevance to today.\"{{sfn|Anne Frank Educational Centre website|2012}}\n\n[[File:Anne Frank Schule Rivierenbuurt.jpg|thumb|upright|The {{ill|6e Montessorischool Anne Frank|lt=Anne Frank School|nl|6e Montessorischool Anne Frank}} in Amsterdam]]\n[[File:Annefranktree edit1.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A large tree, devoid of foliage|The Anne Frank tree in the garden behind the Anne Frank House]]\n\nThe Merwedeplein apartment, where the Frank family lived from 1933 until 1942, remained privately owned until the 2000s. After becoming the focus of a television documentary, the building\u2014in a serious state of disrepair\u2014was purchased by a Dutch housing corporation. Aided by photographs taken by the Frank family and descriptions in letters written by Anne Frank, it was restored to its 1930s appearance. Teresien da Silva of the Anne Frank House and Frank's cousin, Bernhard \"Buddy\" Elias, contributed to the restoration project. It opened in 2005. Each year, a writer who is unable to write freely in his or her own country is selected for a year-long tenancy, during which they reside and write in the apartment. The first writer selected was the Algerian novelist and poet El-Mahdi Acherchour.{{sfn|Anne Frank House Annual Report|2005}}\n\nAnne Frank is included as one of the topics in the [[Canon of Dutch History]], which was prepared by a committee headed by [[Frits van Oostrom]] and presented to the Minister of Education, Culture and Science, [[Maria van der Hoeven]], in 2006; the Canon is a list of fifty topics that aims to provide a chronological summary of Dutch history to be taught in primary schools and the first two years of secondary school in the Netherlands. A revised version, which still includes her as one of the topics, was presented to the Dutch government on 3 October 2007.\n\nIn June 2007, \"Buddy\" Elias donated some 25,000 family documents to the Anne Frank House. Among the artefacts are Frank family photographs taken in Germany and the Netherlands and the letter Otto Frank sent his mother in 1945, informing her that his wife and daughters had perished in Nazi concentration camps.{{sfn|Max|2007}}\n\nIn November 2007, the [[Anne Frank tree]]\u2014by then infected with a fungal disease affecting the tree trunk\u2014was scheduled to be cut down to prevent it from falling on the surrounding buildings. Dutch economist [[Arnold Heertje]] said about the tree: \"This is not just any tree. The Anne Frank tree is bound up with the persecution of the Jews.\"{{sfn|Thomasson|Balmforth|2008}} The Tree Foundation, a group of tree conservationists, started a civil case to stop the felling of the [[Aesculus|horse chestnut]], which received international media attention. A Dutch court ordered city officials and conservationists to explore alternatives and come to a solution.{{sfn|Kreijger|2007}} The parties built a steel construction that was expected to prolong the life of the tree up to 15 years.{{sfn|Thomasson|Balmforth|2008}} However, it was only three years later, on 23 August 2010, that gale-force winds blew down the tree.{{sfn|''Radio Netherlands''|2010}} Eleven saplings from the tree were distributed to museums, schools, parks and Holocaust remembrance centres through a project led by the Anne Frank Center USA. The first sapling was planted in April 2013 at [[The Children's Museum of Indianapolis]]. Saplings were also sent to a school in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], the scene of a desegregation battle; [[Liberty Park (Manhattan)]], which honours victims of the [[September 11 attacks]]; and other sites in the United States.{{sfn|Engel|2013}} Another horse chestnut tree honoring Frank was planted in 2010 at [[Kelly Ingram Park]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/news/nation-world/national/article130975789.html|title=Man wants Anne Frank story shared through national monument|agency=[[The Associated Press]]|work=[[News & Observer]]|date=6 February 2017|accessdate=13 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nOver the years, several [[List of films about Anne Frank|films about Anne Frank]] appeared. Her life and writings have inspired a diverse group of artists and social commentators to make [[Cultural depictions of Anne Frank|reference to her]] in literature, popular music, television, and other media. These include ''The Anne Frank Ballet'' by [[Adam Darius]],{{sfn|Stevens|1989}} first performed in 1959, and the choral work ''[[Annelies (Whitbourn)|Annelies]]'', first performed in 2005.{{sfn|Chester and Novello}} The only known footage of the real Anne Frank comes from a 1941 silent film recorded for her newlywed next-door neighbour.

AnneFrank.org, 31 March 2015</ref> was a [[History of the Jews in Germany|German]]-[[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Dutch]] diarist of [[Jews|Jewish]] origin. One of the most discussed Jewish victims of [[the Holocaust]], she gained fame posthumously with the publication of ''[[The Diary of a Young Girl]]'' (originally {{lang|nl|Het Achterhuis}} in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]; {{lang-en|The Secret Annex}}), in which she documents her life in hiding from 1942 to 1944, during the [[German occupation of the Netherlands]] in [[World War II]]. It is one of the world's best known books and has been the basis for several plays and films.\n\nBorn in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]], she lived most of her life in or near [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]], having moved there with her family at the age of four and a half when the [[Nazi]]s gained control over Germany. Born a German national, she lost her citizenship in 1941 and thus became [[statelessness|stateless]]. By May 1940, the Franks were trapped in Amsterdam by the German occupation of the Netherlands. As [[History of the Jews during World War II|persecutions of the Jewish population]] increased in July 1942, the Franks went into hiding in some [[Anne Frank House|concealed rooms]] behind a bookcase in the building where Anne's father, [[Otto Frank]], worked. From then until the family's arrest by the [[Gestapo]] in August 1944, she kept a diary she had received as a birthday present, and wrote in it regularly. Following their arrest, the Franks were transported to [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]]. In October or November 1944, Anne and her sister, [[Margot Frank|Margot]], were transferred from [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] to [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]], where they died (probably of [[typhus]]) a few months later. They were originally estimated by the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] to have died in March, with Dutch authorities setting 31 March as their official date of death, but research by the [[Anne Frank House]] in 2015 suggests it is more likely that they died in February.<ref name=\"DeathResearch\" />\n\nOtto, the only survivor of the Franks, returned to Amsterdam after the war to find that her diary had been saved by his secretary, [[Miep Gies]], and his efforts led to its publication in 1947. It was translated from its original Dutch version and first published in English in 1952 as ''The Diary of a Young Girl'', and has since been translated into over 70 languages.\n\n== Early life ==\nFrank was born Annelies{{sfn|Anne Frank Fonds}} or Anneliese{{sfn|Barnouw|Van Der Stroom|2003|pp=3, 17}} Marie Frank on 12 June 1929 at the [[Maingau Red Cross Clinic]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rotkreuzkliniken.de/drk_schwesternschaft_bad_homburg-maingau.html |title=Geschichte |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher= Frankfurt Red Cross Clinics |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> in [[Frankfurt]], Germany, to [[Edith Frank|Edith]] ({{n\u00e9e|Holl\u00e4nder}}) and [[Otto Frank|Otto Heinrich Frank]].

In 1931 the family moved to Ganghoferstrasse 24 in a fashionable liberal area of Dornbusch called the Dichterviertel (Poets' Quarter).

Otto Frank remained in Frankfurt, but after receiving an offer to start a company in Amsterdam, he moved there to organize the business and to arrange accommodations for his family.{{sfn|Lee|2000|pp=20\u201323}} He began working at the [[Opekta|Opekta Works]], a company that sold the fruit extract [[pectin]]. Edith travelled back and forth between Aachen and Amsterdam and found an apartment on the Merwedeplein (Merwede Square) in the [[Rivierenbuurt (Amsterdam)|Rivierenbuurt]] neighbourhood of Amsterdam, where more Jewish-German refugees settled.{{sfn|Verhoeven|2019|pp=7\u201312}}  In late December 1933, Edith followed her husband together with Margot.

Despite initial problems with the Dutch language, Margot became a star pupil in Amsterdam.

Frank decided she would use it as a diary,{{sfn|Lee|2000|p=96}} and she began writing in it almost immediately. In her entry dated 20 June 1942, she lists many of the restrictions placed upon the lives of the [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Dutch Jewish]] population.{{sfn|Frank|1995|pp=1\u201320}}\n\nOtto and Edith Frank planned to go into hiding with the children on 16 July 1942, but when Margot received a call-up notice from the [[Zentralstelle f\u00fcr j\u00fcdische Auswanderung]] (Central Office for Jewish Emigration) on 5 July, ordering her to report for relocation to a [[Durchgangslager|work camp]], they were forced to move the plan ten days forward.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=153}} Shortly before going into hiding, Anne gave her friend and neighbour Toosje Kupers a book, a tea set, a tin of marbles. On July 6 the Frank family left a note for the Kupers, asking them to take care of their cat Moortje. As the Associated Press reports: \"'I'm worried about my marbles, because I'm scared they might fall into the wrong hands,' Kupers said Anne told her. 'Could you keep them for me for a little while?'\"<ref>{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|journal=MSN.com|title=Marbles that belonged to Anne Frank rediscovered|url=http://news.msn.com/world/marbles-that-belonged-to-anne-frank-rediscovered|date=4 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Life in the ''Achterhuis'' ===\n[[File:AnneFrankHouse Bookcase.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A three shelf timber bookcase, filled with books, stands at an angle in front of a doorway to the Secret Annexe|Reconstruction of the bookcase that covered the entrance to the Secret Annex, in the [[Anne Frank House]] in Amsterdam]]\n\nOn the morning of Monday, 6 July 1942,{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=163}} the Frank family moved into their hiding place, a three-story space entered from a landing above the Opekta offices on the [[Prinsengracht]], where some of his most trusted employees would be their helpers. This hiding place became known as the ''Achterhuis'' (translated into \"Secret Annex\" in English editions of the diary). Their apartment was left in a state of disarray to create the impression that they had left suddenly, and Otto left a note that hinted they were going to Switzerland. The need for secrecy forced them to leave behind Anne's cat, Moortje. As Jews were not allowed to use public transport, they walked several kilometres from their home.{{sfn|Lee|2000|pp=105\u2013106}} The door to the ''Achterhuis'' was later covered by a bookcase to ensure it remained undiscovered.{{sfn|Westra et al.|2004|pp=45, 107\u2013187}}\n\n[[Victor Kugler]], [[Johannes Kleiman]], [[Miep Gies]], and [[Bep Voskuijl]] were the only employees who knew of the people in hiding. Along with Gies' husband [[Jan Gies]] and Voskuijl's father Johannes Hendrik Voskuijl, they were the \"helpers\" for the duration of their confinement. The only connection between the outside world and the occupants of the house, they kept the occupants informed of war news and political developments. They catered to all of their needs, ensured their safety, and supplied them with food, a task that grew more difficult with the passage of time. Frank wrote of their dedication and of their efforts to boost morale within the household during the most dangerous of times. All were aware that, if caught, they could face the death penalty for sheltering Jews.{{sfn|Lee|2000|pp=113\u2013115}}\n\n[[File:AnneFrankHouseAmsterdamtheNetherlands.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A photograph taken from the opposite side of the canal shows two four-story buildings which housed the Opekta offices and behind them, the Secret Annexe|The house (left) at the Prinsengracht in Amsterdam]]\n[[File:Anne Frank House Model.JPG|thumb|A model of the building where Anne Frank stayed, including the Secret Annex.]]\n\nOn 13 July 1942, the Franks were joined by the Van Pels, made up of Hermann, Auguste, and 16-year-old Peter, and then in November by [[Fritz Pfeffer]], a dentist and friend of the family. Frank wrote of her pleasure at having new people to talk to, but tensions quickly developed within the group forced to live in such confined conditions. After sharing her room with Pfeffer, she found him to be insufferable and resented his intrusion,{{sfn|Lee|2000|pp=120\u201321}} and she clashed with Auguste van Pels, whom she regarded as foolish. She regarded Hermann van Pels and Fritz Pfeffer as selfish, particularly in regard to the amount of food they consumed.{{sfn|Lee|2000|p=117}} Some time later, after first dismissing the shy and awkward Peter van Pels, she recognized a kinship with him and the two entered a romance. She received her first kiss from him, but her infatuation with him began to wane as she questioned whether her feelings for him were genuine, or resulted from their shared confinement.{{sfn|Westra et al.|2004|p=191}} Anne Frank formed a close bond with each of the helpers, and Otto Frank later recalled that she had anticipated their daily visits with impatient enthusiasm. He observed that Anne's closest friendship was with Bep Voskuijl, \"the young typist&nbsp;... the two of them often stood whispering in the corner.\"{{sfn|Lee|2000|p=119}}\n\n=== The young diarist ===\nIn her writing, Frank examined her relationships with the members of her family, and the strong differences in each of their personalities. She considered herself to be closest emotionally to her father, who later commented, \"I got on better with Anne than with Margot, who was more attached to her mother. The reason for that may have been that Margot rarely showed her feelings and didn't need as much support because she didn't suffer from mood swings as much as Anne did.\"{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999||p=203}} The Frank sisters formed a closer relationship than had existed before they went into hiding, although Anne sometimes expressed jealousy towards Margot, particularly when members of the household criticized Anne for lacking Margot's gentle and placid nature. As Anne began to mature, the sisters were able to confide in each other. In her entry of 12 January 1944, Frank wrote, \"Margot's much nicer&nbsp;... She's not nearly so catty these days and is becoming a real friend. She no longer thinks of me as a little baby who doesn't count.\"{{sfn|Frank|1995|p=167}}\n\n[[File:Amsterdam Panaroma.jpg|thumb|alt=Taken from the top of the Westerkerk church, this image shows the Prinsengracht canal and the rooftops of the buildings in the neighborhood|The [[Anne Frank House|Secret Annex]] with its light-coloured walls and orange roof (bottom) and the [[Anne Frank tree]] in the garden behind the house (bottom right), seen from the [[Westerkerk]] in 2004]]\n\nFrank frequently wrote of her difficult relationship with her mother, and of her ambivalence towards her. On 7 November 1942 she described her \"contempt\" for her mother and her inability to \"confront her with her carelessness, her sarcasm and her hard-heartedness,\" before concluding, \"She's not a mother to me.\"{{sfn|Frank|1995|p=63}} Later, as she revised her diary, Frank felt ashamed of her harsh attitude, writing: \"Anne, is it really you who mentioned hate, oh Anne, how could you?\"{{sfn|Frank|1995|p=157}} She came to understand that their differences resulted from misunderstandings that were as much her fault as her mother's, and saw that she had added unnecessarily to her mother's suffering. With this realization, Frank began to treat her mother with a degree of tolerance and respect.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=204}}\n\nThe Frank sisters each hoped to return to school as soon as they were able, and continued with their studies while in hiding. Margot took a [[shorthand]] [[correspondence course|course by correspondence]] in Bep Voskuijl's name and received high marks. Most of Anne's time was spent reading and studying, and she regularly wrote and edited (after March 1944) her diary entries. In addition to providing a narrative of events as they occurred, she wrote about her feelings, beliefs, dreams and ambitions, subjects she felt she could not discuss with anyone. As her confidence in her writing grew, and as she began to mature, she wrote of more abstract subjects such as her belief in God, and how she defined human nature.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=194}}\n\nFrank aspired to become a journalist, writing in her diary on Wednesday, 5 April 1944:\n{{quote\n| I finally realized that I must do my schoolwork to keep from being ignorant, to get on in life, to become a journalist, because that's what I want! I know I can write&nbsp;..., but it remains to be seen whether I really have talent&nbsp;...\n\nAnd if I don't have the talent to write books or newspaper articles, I can always write for myself.

On 5 August they were transferred to the Huis van Bewaring (House of Detention), an overcrowded prison on the Weteringschans. Two days later they were transported to the [[Westerbork transit camp]], through which by that time more than 100,000 Jews, mostly Dutch and German, had passed. Having been arrested in hiding, they were considered criminals and sent to the Punishment Barracks for [[hard labor|hard labour]].{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=233}}\n\nVictor Kugler and Johannes Kleiman were arrested and jailed at the penal camp for enemies of the regime at [[Amersfoort]].

They returned to the ''Achterhuis'' the following day, and found Anne's papers strewn on the floor. They collected them, as well as several family photograph albums, and Gies resolved to return them to Anne after the war. On 7 August 1944, Gies attempted to facilitate the release of the prisoners by confronting Silberbauer and offering him money to intervene, but he refused.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=279}}\n\nAlthough there have been persistent claims of betrayal by an informant, the source of the information that led the authorities to raid the ''Achterhuis'' has never been identified. Night watchman Martin Sleegers and an unidentified police officer investigated a burglary at the premises in April 1944 and came across the bookcase concealing the secret door. Tonny Ahlers, a member of the [[National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands]] (NSB), was suspected of being the informant by [[Carol Ann Lee]], biographer of Otto Frank. Another suspect is stockroom manager Willem van Maaren. The Annex occupants did not trust him, as he seemed inquisitive regarding people entering the stockroom after hours. He once unexpectedly asked the employees whether there had previously been a Mr. Frank at the office. Lena Hartog was suspected of being the informant by Anne Frank's biographer [[Melissa M\u00fcller]]. Several of these suspects knew one another and might have worked in collaboration. While virtually everyone connected with the betrayal was interrogated after the war, no one was definitively identified as being the informant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miepgies.nl/en/The%20betrayal/|title=The betrayal|publisher=Miep Gies|accessdate=20 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, Flemish journalist Jeroen de Bruyn and Joop van Wijk, Bep Voskuijl's youngest son, wrote a biography, ''Bep Voskuijl, het zwijgen voorbij: een biografie van de jongste helper van het Achterhuis'' (''Bep Voskuijl, the Silence is Over: A Biography of the Youngest Helper of the Secret Annex''), in which they alleged that Bep's younger sister Nelly (1923\u20132001) could have betrayed the Frank family.

Those deemed able to work were admitted into the camp, and those deemed unfit for labour were immediately killed. Of the 1,019 passengers, 549\u2014including all children younger than 15\u2014were sent directly to the [[Gas chamber#Nazi Germany|gas chambers]]. Anne Frank, who had turned 15 three months earlier, was one of the youngest people spared from her transport. She was soon made aware that most people were gassed upon arrival and never learned that the entire group from the ''Achterhuis'' had survived this selection. She reasoned that her father, in his mid-fifties and not particularly robust, had been killed immediately after they were separated.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|pp=246\u2013247}}\n\nWith the other women and girls not selected for immediate death, Frank was forced to strip naked to be disinfected, had her head shaved, and was [[Identification in Nazi camps|tattooed with an identifying number]] on her arm. By day, the women were used as slave labour and Frank was forced to haul rocks and dig rolls of sod; by night, they were crammed into overcrowded barracks. Some witnesses later testified Frank became withdrawn and tearful when she saw children being led to the gas chambers; others reported that more often she displayed strength and courage. Her gregarious and confident nature allowed her to obtain extra bread [[Rationing|rations]] for her mother, sister, and herself. Disease was rampant; before long, Frank's skin became badly infected by [[scabies]]. The Frank sisters were moved into an infirmary, which was in a state of constant darkness and infested with rats and mice. Edith Frank stopped eating, saving every morsel of food for her daughters and passing her rations to them through a hole she made at the bottom of the infirmary wall.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|pp=248\u2013251}}\n\n[[File:Anne frank memorial bergen belsen.jpg|thumb|alt=A Memorial for Margot and Anne Frank shows a Star of David and the full names, birthdates, and year of death of each of the sisters, in white lettering on a large black stone.

Bloeme Evers-Emden was scheduled to be on this transport, but Anne was prohibited from going because she had developed scabies, and her mother and sister opted to stay with her. Bloeme went on without them.{{sfn|Laeredt|1995}}\n\nOn 28 October, selections began for women to be relocated to [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]]. More than 8,000 women, including Anne and Margot Frank, and Auguste van Pels, were transported. Edith Frank was left behind and died of starvation.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=252}} Tents were erected at Bergen-Belsen to accommodate the influx of prisoners, and as the population rose, the death toll due to disease increased rapidly. Frank was briefly reunited with two friends, [[Hanneli Goslar]] and [[Nanette Blitz]], who were confined in another section of the camp. Goslar and Blitz survived the war, and discussed the brief conversations they had conducted with Frank through a fence. Blitz described Anne as bald, emaciated, and shivering. Goslar noted Auguste van Pels was with Anne and Margot Frank, and was caring for Margot, who was severely ill. Neither of them saw Margot, as she was too weak to leave her bunk. Anne told Blitz and Goslar she believed her parents were dead, and for that reason she did not wish to live any longer. Goslar later estimated their meetings had taken place in late January or early February 1945.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=255}}\n\nIn early 1945, a [[typhus]] epidemic spread through the camp, killing 17,000 prisoners.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=261}} Other diseases, including [[typhoid fever]], were rampant.{{sfn|Gedenkst\u00e4tten Bergen-Belsen}} Due to these chaotic conditions, it is not possible to determine the specific cause of Anne's death; however, there is evidence that she died from the epidemic.  Gena Turgel, a survivor of Bergen Belsen, knew Anne Frank at the camp.  In 2015, Turgel told the British newspaper, ''The Sun'':  \u201cHer bed was around the corner from me.

Anne died a few days after Margot. The exact dates of Margot's and Anne's deaths were not recorded. It was long thought that their deaths occurred only a few weeks before [[British Army|British soldiers]] liberated the camp on 15 April 1945,{{sfn|Stichting, \"Typhus\"|p=5}} but research in 2015 indicated that they may have died as early as February.<ref name=\"yahoo1\">{{cite web|last=Corder|first=Mike|url=https://news.yahoo.com/anne-frank-house-museum-jewish-diarist-likely-died-092357362.html |title=New research says Anne Frank likely died a month earlier |publisher=Yahoo News |date=31 March 2015 |accessdate=13 April 2015}}</ref> Among other evidence, witnesses recalled that the Franks displayed typhus symptoms by 7 February,<ref name=\"DeathResearch\" /><ref>Park, Madison.

An estimated 30,000 Jews remained in the Netherlands, with many people aided by the [[Dutch underground]]. Approximately two-thirds of this group survived the war.{{sfn|US Holocaust Memorial Museum}}\n\nOtto Frank survived his internment in Auschwitz. After the war ended, he returned to Amsterdam in June 1945 where he was sheltered by Jan and Miep Gies as he attempted to locate his family. He learned of the death of his wife, Edith, in Auschwitz, but remained hopeful that his daughters had survived. After several weeks, he discovered Margot and Anne had also died. He attempted to determine the fates of his daughters' friends and learned many had been murdered. [[Sanne Ledermann]], often mentioned in Anne's diary, had been gassed along with her parents; her sister, Barbara, a close friend of Margot's, had survived.{{sfn|Lee|2000|pp=211\u2013212}} Several of the Frank sisters' school friends had survived, as had the extended families of Otto and Edith Frank, as they had fled Germany during the mid-1930s, with individual family members settling in Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|2013|pp=39, 48\u201349}}\n\n== ''The Diary of a Young Girl'' ==\n{{main|The Diary of a Young Girl}}\n\n=== Publication ===\n[[File:Het Achterhuis (Diary of Anne Frank) - front cover, first edition.jpg|thumb|upright|{{lang|nl|Het Achterhuis}}, the first Dutch edition of Anne Frank's diary, published in 1947, later translated into English as ''[[The Diary of a Young Girl]]''.]]\n\nIn July 1945, after the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] confirmed the deaths of the Frank sisters, Miep Gies gave Otto Frank the diary and a bundle of loose notes that she had saved in the hope of returning them to Anne. Otto Frank later commented that he had not realized Anne had kept such an accurate and well-written record of their time in hiding. In his memoir, he described the painful process of reading the diary, recognizing the events described and recalling that he had already heard some of the more amusing episodes read aloud by his daughter. He saw for the first time the more private side of his daughter and those sections of the diary she had not discussed with anyone, noting, \"For me it was a revelation&nbsp;... I had no idea of the depth of her thoughts and feelings&nbsp;... She had kept all these feelings to herself\".{{sfn|Lee|2000|p=216}} Moved by her repeated wish to be an author, he began to consider having it published.{{sfn|Prose|2009|p=74}}\n\nFrank's diary began as a private expression of her thoughts; she wrote several times that she would never allow anyone to read it. She candidly described her life, her family and companions, and their situation, while beginning to recognize her ambition to write fiction for publication. In March 1944, she heard a radio broadcast by [[Gerrit Bolkestein]]\u2014a member of the Dutch [[government in exile]], based in [[London]]\u2014who said that when the war ended, he would create a public record of the Dutch people's oppression under German occupation.{{sfn|Frank|1995|p=242}} He mentioned the publication of letters and diaries, and Frank decided to submit her work when the time came. She began editing her writing, removing some sections and rewriting others, with a view to publication. Her original notebook was supplemented by additional notebooks and loose-leaf sheets of paper. She created pseudonyms for the members of the household and the helpers. The van Pels family became Hermann, Petronella, and Peter van Daan, and Fritz Pfeffer became Albert D\u00fcssell. In this edited version, she addressed each entry to \"Kitty,\" a fictional character in [[Cissy van Marxveldt]]'s {{lang|nl|[[Joop ter Heul]]}} novels that Anne enjoyed reading. Otto Frank used her original diary, known as \"version A\", and her edited version, known as \"version B\", to produce the first version for publication. Although he restored the true identities of his own family, he retained all of the other pseudonyms.{{sfn|Prose|2009|p=75}}\n\nOtto Frank gave the diary to the historian [[Annie Romein-Verschoor]], who tried unsuccessfully to have it published. She then gave it to her husband [[Jan Romein]], who wrote an article about it, titled {{lang|nl|\"Kinderstem\"}} (\"A Child's Voice\"), which was published in the newspaper {{lang|nl|[[Het Parool]]}} on 3 April 1946. He wrote that the diary \"stammered out in a child's voice, embodies all the hideousness of fascism, more so than all the evidence at [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg]] put together.\"{{sfn|Romein}} His article attracted attention from publishers, and the diary was published in the Netherlands as {{lang|nl|Het Achterhuis}} (''The Annex'') in 1947,{{sfn|Lee|2000|p=223}} followed by five more printings by 1950.{{sfn|Prose|2009|p=80}}\n\nIt was first published in Germany and France in 1950, and after being rejected by several publishers, was first published in the United Kingdom in 1952. The first American edition, published in 1952 under the title ''[[The Diary of a Young Girl|Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl]]'', was positively reviewed. The book was successful in France, Germany, and the United States, but in the United Kingdom it failed to attract an audience and by 1953 was out of print. Its most noteworthy success was in Japan, where it received critical acclaim and sold more than 100,000 copies in its first edition. In Japan, Anne Frank quickly was identified as an important cultural figure who represented the destruction of youth during the war.{{sfn|Lee|2000|p=225}}\n\nA play by [[Albert Hackett|Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett]] based upon the diary premiered in New York City on 5 October 1955, and later won a [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]]. It was followed by the film ''[[The Diary of Anne Frank (1959 film)|The Diary of Anne Frank]]'' (1959), which was a critical and commercial success. Biographer [[Melissa M\u00fcller]] later wrote that the dramatization had \"contributed greatly to the romanticizing, sentimentalizing and universalizing of Anne's story.\"{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=276}} Over the years the popularity of the diary grew, and in many schools, particularly in the United States, it was included as part of the curriculum, introducing Anne Frank to new generations of readers.{{sfn|Prose|2009|pp=253\u2013254}}\n\nIn 1986 the [[Dutch Institute for War Documentation]] published the \"Critical Edition\" of the diary. It includes comparisons from all known versions, both edited and unedited. It includes discussion asserting the diary's authentication, as well as additional historical information relating to the family and the diary itself.{{sfn|Frank|1989|p=102}}\n\nCornelis Suijk\u2014a former director of the [[Anne Frank Foundation]] and president of the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|U.S. Center for Holocaust Education Foundation]]\u2014announced in 1999 that he was in the possession of five pages that had been removed by Otto Frank from the diary prior to publication; Suijk claimed that Otto Frank gave these pages to him shortly before his death in 1980. The missing diary entries contain critical remarks by Anne Frank about her parents' strained marriage and discuss Frank's lack of affection for her mother.{{sfn|Blumenthal|1998}} Some controversy ensued when Suijk claimed publishing rights over the five pages; he intended to sell them to raise money for his foundation. The Netherlands Institute for War Documentation, the formal owner of the manuscript, demanded the pages be handed over. In 2000 the [[Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science]] agreed to donate US$300,000 to Suijk's foundation, and the pages were returned in 2001. Since then, they have been included in new editions of the diary.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|2013|pp=342\u2013344}}\n\n=== Reception ===\n[[File:Diary of Anne Frank 28 sep 1942.jpg|thumb|A page from Anne Frank's first diary]]\nThe diary has been praised for its literary merits. Commenting on Anne Frank's writing style, the dramatist [[Meyer Levin]] commended Frank for \"sustaining the tension of a well-constructed novel\",{{sfn|Levin|1952}} and was so impressed by the quality of her work that he collaborated with Otto Frank on a dramatization of the diary shortly after its publication.{{sfn|Michaelsen|1997}} Levin became obsessed with Anne Frank, which he wrote about in his autobiography ''The Obsession''. The poet [[John Berryman]] called the book a unique depiction, not merely of adolescence but of the \"conversion of a child into a person as it is happening in a precise, confident, economical style stunning in its honesty\".{{sfn|Berryman|2000|p=78}}\n\nIn her introduction to the diary's first American edition, [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] described it as \"one of the wisest and most moving commentaries on war and its impact on human beings that I have ever read.\"{{sfn|Rosow|1996|p=156}} [[John F. Kennedy]] discussed Anne Frank in a 1961 speech, and said, \"Of all the multitudes who throughout history have spoken for human dignity in times of great suffering and loss, no voice is more compelling than that of Anne Frank.\"{{sfn|Westra et al.|2004|p=242}}<ref>{{cite news|title=Kennedy Says Anne Frank's Gift to World Will Survive Her Enemies|url=http://www.jta.org/1961/09/22/archive/kennedy-says-anne-franks-gift-to-world-will-survive-her-enemies|accessdate=27 April 2014|newspaper=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|date=21 September 1961}}</ref> In the same year, the Soviet writer [[Ilya Ehrenburg]] wrote of her: \"one voice speaks for six million\u2014the voice not of a sage or a poet but of an ordinary little girl.\"{{sfn|Graver}}\n\nAs Anne Frank's stature as both a writer and humanist has grown, she has been discussed specifically as a symbol of [[the Holocaust]] and more broadly as a representative of persecution.{{sfn|Feldman|2005}} [[Hillary Clinton]], in her acceptance speech for an [[Elie Wiesel|Elie Wiesel Humanitarian Award]] in 1994, read from Anne Frank's diary and spoke of her \"awakening us to the folly of indifference and the terrible toll it takes on our young,\" which Clinton related to contemporary events in Sarajevo, Somalia and Rwanda.{{sfn|Clinton|1994}} After receiving a humanitarian award from the Anne Frank Foundation in 1994, [[Nelson Mandela]] addressed a crowd in [[Johannesburg]], saying he had read Anne Frank's diary while in prison and \"derived much encouragement from it.\" He likened her struggle against Nazism to his struggle against [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid]], drawing a parallel between the two philosophies: \"Because these beliefs are patently false, and because they were, and will always be, challenged by the likes of Anne Frank, they are bound to fail.\"{{sfn|Mandela|1994}} Also in 1994, [[V\u00e1clav Havel]] said \"Anne Frank's legacy is very much alive and it can address us fully\" in relation to the political and social changes occurring at the time in former Eastern Bloc countries.{{sfn|Westra et al.|2004|p=242}}\n\n[[Primo Levi]] suggested Anne Frank is frequently identified as a single representative of the millions of people who suffered and died as she did because \"One single Anne Frank moves us more than the countless others who suffered just as she did but whose faces have remained in the shadows. Perhaps it is better that way; if we were capable of taking in all the suffering of all those people, we would not be able to live.\"{{sfn|Westra et al.|2004|p=242}} In her closing message in M\u00fcller's biography of Anne Frank, Miep Gies expressed a similar thought, though she attempted to dispel what she felt was a growing misconception that \"Anne symbolises the six million victims of the Holocaust\", writing: \"Anne's life and death were her own individual fate, an individual fate that happened six million times over. Anne cannot, and should not, stand for the many individuals whom the Nazis robbed of their lives&nbsp;... But her fate helps us grasp the immense loss the world suffered because of the Holocaust.\"{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1999|p=305}}\n\nOtto Frank spent the remainder of his life as custodian of his daughter's legacy, saying, \"It's a strange role. In the normal family relationship, it is the child of the famous parent who has the honour and the burden of continuing the task. In my case the role is reversed.\" He recalled his publisher's explaining why he thought the diary has been so widely read, with the comment, \"he said that the diary encompasses so many areas of life that each reader can find something that moves him personally\".{{sfn|Lee|2000|pp=222\u201333}} Simon Wiesenthal expressed a similar sentiment when he said that the diary had raised more widespread awareness of the Holocaust than had been achieved during the [[Nuremberg Trials]], because \"people identified with this child. This was the impact of the Holocaust, this was a family like my family, like your family and so you could understand this.\"{{sfn|Stichting, \"Simon Wiesenthal\"}}\n\nIn June 1999, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine published a special edition titled \"[[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century]]\". Anne Frank was selected as one of the \"Heroes & Icons\", and the writer, Roger Rosenblatt, described her legacy with the comment, \"The passions the book ignites suggest that everyone owns Anne Frank, that she has risen above the Holocaust, Judaism, girlhood and even goodness and become a totemic figure of the modern world\u2014the moral individual mind beset by the machinery of destruction, insisting on the right to live and question and hope for the future of human beings.\" He notes that while her courage and pragmatism are admired, her ability to analyse herself and the quality of her writing are the key components of her appeal. He writes, \"The reason for her immortality was basically literary. She was an extraordinarily good writer, for any age, and the quality of her work seemed a direct result of a ruthlessly honest disposition.\"{{sfn|Rosenblatt|1999}}\n\n=== Denials of authenticity and legal action ===\nAfter the diary became widely known in the late 1950s, various allegations against the veracity of the diary and/or its contents appeared, with the earliest published criticisms occurring in Sweden and Norway.{{sfn|Prose|2009|p=241}}\n\nIn 1957, ''{{lang|sv|Fria ord}}'' (\"Free Words\"), the magazine of the Swedish [[neofascist]] organization [[National League of Sweden]], published an article by Danish author and critic Harald Nielsen, who had previously written antisemitic articles about the Danish-Jewish author [[Georg Brandes]].{{sfn|Frank|Holmer|2005|p=340}} Among other things, the article claimed that the diary had been written by Meyer Levin.{{sfn|Stichting, \"Authenticity of the Diary\"}}\n\nIn 1958, at a performance of ''The Diary of Anne Frank'' in Vienna, [[Simon Wiesenthal]] was challenged by a group of protesters who asserted that Anne Frank had never existed, and who challenged Wiesenthal to prove her existence by finding the man who had arrested her. Wiesenthal indeed began searching for [[Karl Silberbauer]] and found him in 1963. When interviewed, Silberbauer admitted his role, and identified Anne Frank from a photograph as one of the people arrested. Silberbauer provided a full account of events, even recalling emptying a briefcase full of papers onto the floor. His statement corroborated the version of events that had previously been presented by witnesses such as Otto Frank.{{sfn|Lee|2000|pp=241\u2013246}}\n\nIn 1959, Otto Frank took legal action in [[L\u00fcbeck]] against Lothar Stielau, a school teacher and former [[Hitler Youth]] member who published a school paper that described the diary as \"a forgery\". The complaint was extended to include Heinrich Buddegerg, who wrote a letter in support of Stielau, which was published in a L\u00fcbeck newspaper. The court examined the diary in 1960 and authenticated the handwriting as matching that in letters known to have been written by Anne Frank. They declared the diary to be genuine. Stielau recanted his earlier statement, and Otto Frank did not pursue the case any further.{{sfn|Stichting, \"Authenticity of the Diary\"}}\n\nIn 1976, Otto Frank took action against Heinz Roth of Frankfurt, who published pamphlets stating that the diary was \"a forgery\". The judge ruled that if Roth  was to publish any further statements he would be subjected to a fine of 500,000 German marks and a six-month jail sentence. Roth appealed against the court's decision. He died in 1978, and after a year his appeal was rejected.{{sfn|Stichting, \"Authenticity of the Diary\"}}\n\nOtto Frank mounted a lawsuit in 1976 against Ernst R\u00f6mer, who distributed a pamphlet titled \"The Diary of Anne Frank, Bestseller, A Lie\". When a man named Edgar Geiss distributed the same pamphlet in the courtroom, he too was prosecuted. R\u00f6mer was fined 1,500 Deutschmarks,{{sfn|Stichting, \"Authenticity of the Diary\"}} and Geiss was sentenced to six months' imprisonment. The sentence of Geiss was reduced on appeal, and the case was eventually dropped following a subsequent appeal because the time limit for filing a libel case had expired.{{sfn|Stichting, \"Legal rulings\"}}\n\nWith Otto Frank's death in 1980, the original diary, including letters and loose sheets, was willed to the Dutch Institute for War Documentation,{{sfn|Lee|2000|p=233}} which commissioned a forensic study of the diary through the Netherlands Ministry of Justice in 1986. They examined the handwriting against known examples and found that they matched. They determined that the paper, glue, and ink were readily available during the time the diary was said to have been written. They concluded that the diary is authentic, and their findings were published in what has become known as the \"Critical Edition\" of the diary.{{sfn|Prose|2009|pp=247\u2013248}} In 1990, the Hamburg Regional Court confirmed the diary's authenticity.{{sfn|Frank|1989|p=102}}\n\nIn 1991, [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]] [[Robert Faurisson]] and [[Siegfried Verbeke]] produced a booklet titled \"The Diary of Anne Frank: A Critical Approach\", in which they revived the allegation that Otto Frank wrote the diary. Purported evidence, as before, included several contradictions in the diary, that the prose style and handwriting were not those of a teenager, and that hiding in the ''Achterhuis'' would have been impossible.{{sfn|Faurisson|2000}}{{sfn|Barnouw|Van Der Stroom|2003|pp=93\u201396}} In 1993, the [[Anne Frank House]] in Amsterdam and the Anne Frank Fonds in Basel filed a civil lawsuit to prohibit further distribution of Faurisson and Verbeke's booklet in the Netherlands. In 1998, the Amsterdam District Court ruled in favour of the claimants, forbade any further denial of the authenticity of the diary and unsolicited distribution of publications to that effect, and imposed a penalty of 25,000 guilders per infringement.{{sfn|Stichting, \"Ten Questions\"}}\n\n=== Unabridged version ===\n<!-- DO NOT INSERT MATERIAL THAT IS NOT IN THE O'TOOLE SOURCE WITHOUT ADDING A RELIABLE THIRD PARTY SOURCE THAT *DOES* SUPPORT IT! --> \nAn unabridged edition of Anne Frank's work was published in 1995.{{sfn|Boretz|1995}} This version included Anne's description of her exploration of her own genitalia and her puzzlement regarding sex and childbirth, a passage that had previously been edited out by Otto Frank.{{sfn|O'Toole|2013}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:AnneFrankMuseumLine.jpg|thumb|People waiting in line in front of the Anne Frank House entrance in Amsterdam]]\n\nOn 3 May 1957, a group of citizens, including Otto Frank, established the Anne Frank Stichting in an effort to rescue the Prinsengracht building from demolition and to make it accessible to the public. The [[Anne Frank House]] opened on 3 May 1960. It consists of the Opekta warehouse and offices and the ''{{lang|nl|Achterhuis}}'', all unfurnished so that visitors can walk freely through the rooms. Some personal relics of the former occupants remain, such as movie star photographs glued by Anne to a wall, a section of wallpaper on which Otto Frank marked the height of his growing daughters, and a map on the wall where he recorded the advance of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]], all now protected behind [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|acrylic glass]]. From the small room which was once home to Peter van Pels, a walkway connects the building to its neighbours, also purchased by the Foundation. These other buildings are used to house the diary, as well as rotating exhibits that chronicle aspects of the Holocaust and more contemporary examinations of racial intolerance around the world. One of Amsterdam's main tourist attractions, it received a record 965,000 visitors in 2005. The House provides information via the internet and offers exhibitions that in 2005 travelled to 32 countries in Europe, Asia, North America, and South America.{{sfn|Anne Frank House Annual Report|2005}}\n\n[[File:Anne Frank M01.JPG|thumb|left|upright|alt=A bronze statue of a smiling Anne Frank, wearing a short dress and standing with her arms behind her back, sits upon a stone [[plinth]] with a [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] reading \"Anne Frank 1929\u20131945\". The statue is in a small square, and behind it is a brick building with two large windows, and a bicycle. The statue stands between the two windows.|Statue of Anne Frank, by [[Mari Andriessen]], outside the [[Westerkerk]] in Amsterdam]]\n\nIn 1963, Otto Frank and his second wife, [[Elfriede Geiringer-Markovits]], set up the Anne Frank Fonds as a [[Charitable organization|charitable foundation]], based in [[Basel]], Switzerland. Upon his death, Otto willed the diary's copyright to the Fonds, on the provision that the first 80,000 [[Swiss franc]]s in income each year was to be distributed to his heirs. The Anne Frank Fonds represents the Frank family. It administers the rights, \u00abinter alia\u00bb, to the writings of Anne and Otto Frank and to the letters of the Frank family. It is the owner of the rights to translations, editions, compilations, and authorised books about Anne Frank and her family. The Fonds aims to educate young people against racism, and loaned some of Anne Frank's papers to the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] in Washington for an exhibition in 2003. Its annual report that year outlined its efforts to contribute on a global level, with support for projects in Germany, Israel, India, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.{{sfn|Anne Frank-Fonds Annual Report|2003}}\n\nIn 1997, the [[Anne Frank Educational Centre (Frankfurt)|Anne Frank Educational Centre]] (''{{lang|de|Jugendbegegnungsst\u00e4tte Anne Frank}}'') was opened in the [[Dornbusch (Frankfurt am Main)|Dornbusch]] neighbourhood of Frankfurt, where Frank lived with her family until 1934. The Centre is \"a place where both young people and adults can learn about the history of National Socialism and discuss its relevance to today.\"{{sfn|Anne Frank Educational Centre website|2012}}\n\n[[File:Anne Frank Schule Rivierenbuurt.jpg|thumb|upright|The {{ill|6e Montessorischool Anne Frank|lt=Anne Frank School|nl|6e Montessorischool Anne Frank}} in Amsterdam]]\n[[File:Annefranktree edit1.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A large tree, devoid of foliage|The Anne Frank tree in the garden behind the Anne Frank House]]\n\nThe Merwedeplein apartment, where the Frank family lived from 1933 until 1942, remained privately owned until the 2000s. After becoming the focus of a television documentary, the building\u2014in a serious state of disrepair\u2014was purchased by a Dutch housing corporation. Aided by photographs taken by the Frank family and descriptions in letters written by Anne Frank, it was restored to its 1930s appearance. Teresien da Silva of the Anne Frank House and Frank's cousin, Bernhard \"Buddy\" Elias, contributed to the restoration project. It opened in 2005. Each year, a writer who is unable to write freely in his or her own country is selected for a year-long tenancy, during which they reside and write in the apartment. The first writer selected was the Algerian novelist and poet El-Mahdi Acherchour.{{sfn|Anne Frank House Annual Report|2005}}\n\nAnne Frank is included as one of the topics in the [[Canon of Dutch History]], which was prepared by a committee headed by [[Frits van Oostrom]] and presented to the Minister of Education, Culture and Science, [[Maria van der Hoeven]], in 2006; the Canon is a list of fifty topics that aims to provide a chronological summary of Dutch history to be taught in primary schools and the first two years of secondary school in the Netherlands. A revised version, which still includes her as one of the topics, was presented to the Dutch government on 3 October 2007.\n\nIn June 2007, \"Buddy\" Elias donated some 25,000 family documents to the Anne Frank House. Among the artefacts are Frank family photographs taken in Germany and the Netherlands and the letter Otto Frank sent his mother in 1945, informing her that his wife and daughters had perished in Nazi concentration camps.{{sfn|Max|2007}}\n\nIn November 2007, the [[Anne Frank tree]]\u2014by then infected with a fungal disease affecting the tree trunk\u2014was scheduled to be cut down to prevent it from falling on the surrounding buildings. Dutch economist [[Arnold Heertje]] said about the tree: \"This is not just any tree. The Anne Frank tree is bound up with the persecution of the Jews.\"{{sfn|Thomasson|Balmforth|2008}} The Tree Foundation, a group of tree conservationists, started a civil case to stop the felling of the [[Aesculus|horse chestnut]], which received international media attention. A Dutch court ordered city officials and conservationists to explore alternatives and come to a solution.{{sfn|Kreijger|2007}} The parties built a steel construction that was expected to prolong the life of the tree up to 15 years.{{sfn|Thomasson|Balmforth|2008}} However, it was only three years later, on 23 August 2010, that gale-force winds blew down the tree.{{sfn|''Radio Netherlands''|2010}} Eleven saplings from the tree were distributed to museums, schools, parks and Holocaust remembrance centres through a project led by the Anne Frank Center USA. The first sapling was planted in April 2013 at [[The Children's Museum of Indianapolis]]. Saplings were also sent to a school in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], the scene of a desegregation battle; [[Liberty Park (Manhattan)]], which honours victims of the [[September 11 attacks]]; and other sites in the United States.{{sfn|Engel|2013}} Another horse chestnut tree honoring Frank was planted in 2010 at [[Kelly Ingram Park]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/news/nation-world/national/article130975789.html|title=Man wants Anne Frank story shared through national monument|agency=[[The Associated Press]]|work=[[News & Observer]]|date=6 February 2017|accessdate=13 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nOver the years, several [[List of films about Anne Frank|films about Anne Frank]] appeared. Her life and writings have inspired a diverse group of artists and social commentators to make [[Cultural depictions of Anne Frank|reference to her]] in literature, popular music, television, and other media. These include ''The Anne Frank Ballet'' by [[Adam Darius]],{{sfn|Stevens|1989}} first performed in 1959, and the choral work ''[[Annelies (Whitbourn)|Annelies]]'', first performed in 2005.{{sfn|Chester and Novello}} The only known footage of the real Anne Frank comes from a 1941 silent film recorded for her newlywed next-door neighbour. She is seen leaning out of a second-floor window in an attempt to better view the bride and groom.

Very few full disk images have ever been taken in the past, mostly on approach to the planet, as most imaging is done looking straight down in mapping mode.

In countries with different [[Head of state|heads of state]] and [[Head of government|heads of government]], both offices are listed. For leaders who held the same office prior to their [[Sovereign state|state]]'s independence, the start of their tenure is used, not independence. For a list of heads of state taking dates of independence into account, see [[List of heads of state by diplomatic precedence]].\n\nActing presidents are included in this list, but if a leader has non-consecutive terms, only the current period of service is listed.\n\n[[Sovereign state|States]] where head of state differs from head of government are mainly [[parliamentary system]]s. Often a leader holds both positions in [[presidential system]]s or [[dictatorship]]s. Some states have [[semi-presidential system]]s where the head of government role is fulfilled by both the listed head of government and the head of state.\n\n== List of state leaders by date of assuming office ==\n\n=== Prior to 1970 ===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-bgcolor=\"#cccccc\"\n!Assumed office\n!Leader\n!State\n!Office\n|-\n|rowspan=16|6 February 1952\n|rowspan=16|[[Elizabeth II]]<ref>Elizabeth II was [[List of heads of state of Sri Lanka#Monarch (1948\u20131972)|Queen]] of [[Dominion of Ceylon|Ceylon]] from 6 February 1952&nbsp;\u2013 22 May 1972, [[Queen of Pakistan|Queen]] of [[Pakistan]] from 6 February 1952&nbsp;\u2013 23 March 1956, [[Monarchy of South Africa|Queen]] of [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]] from 6 February 1952&nbsp;\u2013 31 May 1961, [[Queen of Ghana|Queen]] of [[Ghana]] from 6 March 1957&nbsp;\u2013 28 April 1960, [[Queen of Nigeria|Queen]] of [[Nigeria]] from 1 October 1960&nbsp;\u2013 1 October 1963, [[Queen of Sierra Leone|Queen]] of [[Sierra Leone]] from 27 April 1961&nbsp;\u2013 19 April 1971, [[Queen of Tanganyika|Queen]] of [[Tanganyika]] from 9 December 1961&nbsp;\u2013 9 June 1962, [[Queen of Trinidad and Tobago|Queen]] of [[Trinidad and Tobago]] from 31 August 1962&nbsp;\u2013 1 August 1976, [[Queen of Uganda|Queen]] of [[Uganda]] from 9 October 1962&nbsp;\u2013 9 October 1963, [[Queen of Kenya|Queen]] of [[Kenya]] from 12 December 1963&nbsp;\u2013 12 December 1964, [[Queen of Malawi|Queen]] of [[Malawi]] from 6 July 1964&nbsp;\u2013 6 July 1966, [[Queen of Malta|Queen]] of [[Malta]] from 21 September 1964&nbsp;\u2013 13 December 1974, [[Queen of the Gambia|Queen]] of [[The Gambia|Gambia]] from 18 February 1965&nbsp;\u2013 24 April 1970, [[Queen of Guyana|Queen]] of [[Guyana]] from 26 May 1966&nbsp;\u2013 23 February 1970, [[Queen of Mauritius|Queen]] of [[Mauritius]] from 12 March 1968&nbsp;\u2013 12 March 1992 and [[Monarchy of Fiji|Queen]] of [[Fiji]] from 10 October 1970&nbsp;\u2013 15 October 1987.</ref><ref name=\"Commonwealth\">The [[Governor-General|Governors-General]] of each [[Commonwealth realm]] outside of the [[United Kingdom]] represent [[Elizabeth II]].</ref>\n|{{flag|United Kingdom}}\n|[[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Queen]]\n|-\n|{{flag|Australia}}\n|[[Monarchy of Australia|Queen]]\n|-\n|{{flag|Canada}}\n|[[Monarchy of Canada|Queen]]\n|-\n|{{flag|New Zealand}}\n|[[Monarchy of New Zealand|Queen]]\n|-\n|{{flag|Jamaica}}\n|[[Monarchy of Jamaica|Queen]]: 6 August 1962&nbsp;\u2013 present<ref name=\"British colony\">This is the date of this territory's independence from the United Kingdom.

In countries with different [[Head of state|heads of state]] and [[Head of government|heads of government]], both offices are listed. For leaders who held the same office prior to their [[Sovereign state|state]]'s independence, the start of their tenure is used, not independence. For a list of heads of state taking dates of independence into account, see [[List of heads of state by diplomatic precedence]].\n\nActing presidents are included in this list, but if a leader has non-consecutive terms, only the current period of service is listed.\n\n[[Sovereign state|States]] where head of state differs from head of government are mainly [[parliamentary system]]s. Often a leader holds both positions in [[presidential system]]s or [[dictatorship]]s.
