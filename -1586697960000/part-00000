It originally ran from 28 September 1981 to 19 March 1992 on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network.\n\nThe series spawned a spin-off show, ''[[Count Duckula]]'', which aired between 1988 and 1993, and an updated series, [[Danger Mouse (2015 TV series)|under the same name]], began airing in September 2015 on [[CBBC]].<ref name=\"theguardian.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jul/13/lena-headey-john-oliver-danger-mouse|title=Crumbs!

He speaks 34 languages fluently, including some extraterrestrial ones. His skills are of a wide variety, including the ability to shatter metal with his voice, perform military style push-ups on his index finger, and reach a 7th level of meditation. He is also a practitioner of the ancient [[martial art]] of Kung Moggy. He is referred to as the \"White Wonder\" and \"Wretched Rodent\" by his nemesis, Baron Greenback. His catchphrases include \"Good grief\" when he becomes upset or shocked, \"Penfold, shush\" when his assistant makes a foolish remark, and \"Blast\" when his adventure inevitably goes awry. He was originally going to be brown; however, the creators thought that he and Penfold needed to be different colors.\n* Ernest Penfold <!-- S1 ep. 1 intro, also in captions for S2 --> (voiced by [[Terry Scott]]) is a timid, bespectacled hamster, and Danger Mouse's reluctant assistant and [[sidekick]]. He is often mistaken for a mole; however, Brian Cosgrove has stated Penfold is supposed to be a hamster.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://danger-mouse.net/cosgrove.html|title=Interview with Brian Cosgrove on danger-mouse.net|date=|accessdate=7 December 2012}}</ref> Penfold stands just over half the height of Danger Mouse, and always wears thick round glasses and a crumpled blue suit with a white shirt and a yellow and black striped tie. In the first episode, he is codenamed the Jigsaw \"because when he is faced with a problem, he goes to pieces.\"{{Ref|Episode|S1 ep 1}}\n<!--  original research, needs refs\nHe appears in every episode accompanying Danger Mouse, and he is often captured or getting himself into other dangerous situations before needing to be rescued by Danger Mouse. His main catchphrase is \"Crumbs, DM!\" and others include \"Oh, heck!\", \"Oh, fiddle!\" and \"Oh, carrots!\", all said when things go wrong. He also says \"Coming, Chief!\" when Danger Mouse wants to speak with him. Nevertheless, he appears to have some moral fibre, and is willing to resist Evil when things begin to go wrong\u2014at least temporarily. He is a self-proclaimed expert in the martial art referred to in the cartoon as \"kung moggy\", though his skills do not do him much good in practice. He almost always makes ridiculous responses, whether by misunderstanding or mistaking as a joke, to which DM tells him to \"shush\".\n-->\n* Colonel K (voiced by [[Edward Kelsey]]): Danger Mouse's boss; often mistaken for a [[walrus]], it was revealed in an issue of ''Look-in'' magazine that he is, in fact, a [[chinchilla]]. He previously worked for [[Special Branch]], where he was known as [[Special K]]. He is a champion [[piano]]-thrower, [[Commonwealth Realms orders and decorations|decorated]] [[judo]] expert, the first to climb [[Mount Everest]] on a [[pogo stick]], was once an [[Eskimo]], took up [[tap-dancing]], is a former [[kleptomaniac]], and cheats at [[croquet]]. During the last two seasons, he became more absent-minded, tending to frustrate both DM and Penfold with his tendency to ramble nonsense. Often when it is time for the Colonel to say \"over and out\", he forgets what the phrase is in a temporary case of memory loss. Other times, he becomes frustrated when Danger Mouse does not immediately respond, such as if he is in the middle of a yoga exercise.\n* [[Baron]] Silas Greenback (voiced by [[Edward Kelsey]]): The recurring [[villain]] and Danger Mouse's [[archenemy]]; a [[toad]] with a wheezy voice, although, sometimes, he was referred to as a [[frog]]. Known as Baron Greenteeth in the unbroadcast pilot episode. Commonly known as the \"Terrible Toad\". In America, \"Greenback\" is slang for dollar bill in many regions, adding to the sense of his commercial greed. Allegedly, he turned to a life of crime as a schoolboy when other children stole his bicycle and let all the air out of its tyres. In the 2015 revival series, the character was renamed Baron Silas von Greenback, and was given a German accent.\n* Stiletto (voiced by [[Brian Trueman]]): Greenback's henchman; a [[crow]]. He always called Greenback \"Barone\", [[Italian language|Italian]] for \"Baron\". In the original British version, he speaks with an Italian accent; this was changed to a [[Cockney]] accent for [[United States of America|U.S.]] distribution (i.e., [[Nickelodeon]]) to avoid offending Italian-Americans, and all references to his [[surname]] were removed as well, although the Italian word \"Barone\" was retained. In several episodes, a short silence after his first name is said and the next word is quite obvious. The original voicing has been restored on all U.S. VHS and DVD releases and during its Cheez TV run. His last name is Mafiosa.\n* Nero (sounds provided by [[David Jason]]): Greenback's pet. A fluffy white [[caterpillar]] (equivalent to the stereotypical white [[cat]] frequently associated with arch villains, particularly [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]]). He is a non-speaking character, although his noises and laugh are supplied by David Jason's voice sped up. Readily understood by Greenback and, less frequently, by Stiletto. At one time, he is shown to have a form of telekinesis after falling into one of Greenback's inventions, proving to be just as much a match to DM and Penfold as his master. However, he lost this power when he was drenched in water. In the special features of Danger Mouse cartoons, audiences were informed that Nero is actually the mastermind of Greenback's schemes.\n* The Narrator (voiced by [[David Jason]]): The unseen narrator, who occasionally interacts with the characters, sometimes to the point of halting the plot for one reason or another (in one episode, he accidentally sends Danger Mouse back in time). He often voices his disdain for the show and his job, to the point that he refuses outright to narrate some episodes altogether. He usually comments at the end of every episode when the credits roll before the end theme tune begins. These comments\u2014along with the episode breaks\u2014have been cut from some releases, greatly reducing the size of this character's part. His name is Isambard Sinclair.{{episode needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Supporting===\n* Flying Officer Buggles Pigeon (voiced by [[David Jason]]): Another of Colonel K's agents who came to the aid of Danger Mouse and Penfold in the episode, \"Chicken Run,\" and appeared in several episodes afterward.{{Ref|Episode|S1 ep. 4, 10}} His name is a reference to [[Biggles|James Bigglesworth]].{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n* Leatherhead (voiced by [[Terry Scott]]): Greenback's other crow henchman. Even less intelligent than Stiletto, he only appeared in several of the early episodes, where he spent most of his time reading comic books.{{Ref|Episode|S1 ep. 8}}\n* Agent 57: A master of disguise, appearing initially as an earthworm. Agent 57 has disguised himself so often that he forgot his original appearance.{{Ref|Episode|S1 ep. 8}} He gained the ability to alter his own [[molecular structure]] to transform into any appearance he wished. This ability went temporarily out of control in one episode when he contracted a [[common cold|cold]], causing him to involuntarily [[Shapeshifting|change shape]] whenever he [[sneeze]]d.{{episode needed|date=March 2020}}\n* Miss Boathook: Colonel K's secretary, only referred to by the colonel and never seen (though sometimes heard).{{Ref|Episode|S2 ep. 1}} In some versions, the Colonel's secretary is referred to as Miss Prentergast{{Ref|Episode|S2 ep. 5a}}<!-- bad luck eye pt. 1 -->  or Miss Hackett.\n* Count Duckula (voiced by [[David Jason]]): A fame-obsessed [[vampire]] [[duck]] who wants to appear in television. However, his utter lack of anything approaching talent makes his attempts to \"entertain\" rather terrifying (he has been known to use his \"act\" as a torture device). This resulted in a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series, titled ''[[Count Duckula]]'', starring the Count himself. The two versions of the character differ, however; the character featured in ''Danger Mouse'' is not a [[vegetarian]], makes far greater use of his vampiric magic, and has an accent consisting of a lisp and a stutter, as well as occasional stuttering and duck-like squawks and quacks.\n* Doctor Augustus P. [[Crumhorn]] III (voiced by [[Jimmy Hibbert]]): A mad scientist [[wolf]], he recurred as Danger Mouse's adversary less frequently than Baron Greenback (in four episodes in total). In one episode, he attempted to undermine Danger Mouse by metamorphosing into a [[Shirley Temple]] lookalike. In only one episode, \"Penfold Transformed\", as opposed to his stage name \"Augustus P. Crumhorn III\", he lists his full name as, \"Aloisius Julian Philibert Elphinstone Eugene [[Dionysis]] [[Barry Manilow]] Crumhorn\", omitting both Augustus and the III. Crumhorn and Greenback were at odds; once Crumhorn kidnapped Penfold and Penfold managed to escape simply because the two villains were too busy quarreling to notice his absence.\n* Fifi: Fifi is an unseen character mentioned occasionally throughout the show, but Danger Mouse is reluctant to discuss her. According to Cosgrove Hall, she is Danger Mouse's ex-girlfriend.\n* J. J. Quark: an antagonistic alien who claims possession of Earth based on a cosmic charter granted to his Great-great-great-great grandfather.\n* Grovell: J. J. Quark's obsequious robot flunkie who grovels whenever his name is mentioned, to Quark's consternation.\n* Penfold's Aunt (voiced by [[Brian Trueman]]): Penfold's formidable aunt from Abergavenny, Wales, who sends him cookies in the episode, \"The Statue of Liberty Caper\". The fact that she is Welsh is stated by the piece of a witch's broom in \"The Four Tasks of Danger Mouse\". The broom is her fifth cousin. She denies that Danger Mouse is a real secret agent and says that he and Penfold are just playing silly pretend games.\n* Professor Heinrich Von Squawkencluck (voiced by [[Edward Kelsey]]) [[Mad scientist]]/[[inventor]]/[[boffin]]. Inventor of the Mark III, Danger Mouse's [[flying car (fiction)|flying car]], and the [[Space Hopper]], his personal [[spacecraft]]. A [[Mole (animal)|mole]], despite his [[bird|avian]] name (which comes from his first appearance on the show, in which, he was engaged in [[hormone]] experiments to grow [[chickens]] to enormous sizes). He speaks in a broken [[German language|German]] accent. Penfold is naturally leery of the professor, as he often winds up on the wrong side of his experiments.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe show was created by Mark Hall<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-15792282|title=Danger Mouse co-creator Mark Hall dies|work=BBC News}}</ref> and [[Brian Cosgrove]] for their production company, [[Cosgrove Hall Films]]. Danger Mouse was based on Patrick McGoohan's lead role in ''[[Danger Man]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://danger-mouse.net/cosgrove.html|title=Club DM|work=danger-mouse.net}}</ref>\n\nThe show was intended to have a more serious tone as seen in the pilot episode but [[Mike Harding]] gave Brian Cosgrove and Mark Hall the idea to make the series silly. Mike said: \"The characters had got stuck in reality and were doing James Bond type things rooted in the solid real world. I argued that once you invented a Mouse Secret Agent then all of creation and a good chunk of not creation was his oyster. In other words we could be as barmy (crazy) as we wanted.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mikeharding.co.uk/tvradio/cosgrove-hall/|title=Cosgrove Hall|work=mikeharding.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nBy 1983, the show's viewing figures hit an all-time high of 21 million viewers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/image_galleries/cosgrove_hall_30_years_gallery.shtml?3|title=Cosgrove Hall: 30 years |work=BBC Manchester|publisher=BBC|date=|accessdate=1 June 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060308063921/http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/image_galleries/cosgrove_hall_30_years_gallery.shtml?3|archivedate=8 March 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://stv.tv/news/east-central/103700-rocking-it-up-at-the-inland-revenue/|title=Ooh-eck, Penfold are rocking it up at the Inland Revenue|website=STV News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24429892|title=How Danger Mouse became king of the TV ratings|date=11 October 2013|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nOn 4 June 1984, the show was the first British cartoon to appear on [[Nickelodeon]]\nand became one of the earliest ones to be in [[TV syndication|syndication]] in America,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/danger-mouse-remake-more-female-716877|title='Danger Mouse' Remake: More Female Characters Planned|last=Szalai|first=Georg|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref> as it appealed to both preteens and adults with its quick-witted English humour.<ref name=\"FNTVF\">{{cite book|last1=Hannah|first1=Warner|title=Fascinating TV Facts|edition=1|year=2004|publisher=Ted Smart|location=[[London]]|isbn=0-7535-0919-9|page=99}}</ref> It was often compared to American audiences as a British equivalent of ''[[The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show]]'', due to its gentle satire of politics and outrageous plots.\n\nIn the UK, [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[100 Greatest (UK TV series)|100 Greatest Kids' TV Shows]]'', the show came third, beaten only by ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest/kidstv/results.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020804015958/http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest/kidstv/results.html |title=100 Greatest Kids' TV Shows |publisher=channel4.com |archivedate=4 August 2002 |accessdate=26 August 2010}}</ref> It returned to terrestrial television after the [[BBC]] purchased episodes of it to broadcast in its daytime schedules with its first broadcast on 12 February 2007.<ref name=\"BFI\">[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/737309/index.html \"Dangermouse (1981-1992)\"].

This time-and-money saving device was cheerfully admitted by both Brian Cosgrove, who conceived the character and the show, and [[Brian Trueman]], who wrote almost all the scripts from the beginning.\n\n==In other media==\n===Comics===\nA long-running [[comic strip]] adaptation, written by [[Angus P. Allan]] and illustrated by [[Arthur Ranson]], ran in ''[[Look-in]]'' magazine and was [[Print syndication|syndicated]] in various other magazines. Ranson also provided some backdrops for the show. Allan and Ranson's work was highly appreciated by Cosgrove Hall, and the pair were awarded an \"Oh Goodness!, Oh Crikey!\" award in appreciation of their services. Some of Allan's stories were adapted for the show, although Allan's name was misspelled \"Angus Allen\". Artist Ranson later went on to illustrate [[Judge Anderson]] in the UK [[comic]] ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]''.\n\n===Video games===\nA series of [[video game]]s based on the character also appeared. The first were ''Danger Mouse in Double Trouble'' and ''Danger Mouse in the Black Forest Chateau'' (both in 1984) followed by ''Danger Mouse in Making Whoopee!'' in 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/index.php?cat=96&id=1247 |title=Danger Mouse in Double Trouble |publisher=SpectrumComputing |date= |accessdate=30 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/index.php?cat=96&id=1249 |title=Danger Mouse in the Black Forest Chateau |publisher=SpectrumComputing |date= |accessdate=30 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/index.php?cat=96&id=1248 |title=Danger Mouse in Making Whoopee! |publisher=SpectrumComputing |date= |accessdate=30 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nTwo mobile games were published by ZED Worldwide;  ''Danger Mouse: Quiz'' in 2010 and ''Danger Mouse'' in 2011.\n\n===Audiobooks===\nSome stories were also available as read-along cassettes with accompanying books. They were re-read by the cast for audio.\n\n===Merchandise===\nDuring its run, the show spawned a wide range of merchandise, including storybooks, hardback annuals, jigsaw puzzles, a [[Panini Group|Panini]] sticker album, [[View-Master]] reels, and of course, VHS releases. In the years since, products have continued to sell, often aimed at the now-adult audience which grew up with it, such as T-shirts, mugs, key rings, fridge magnets and posters. To coincide with the 25th anniversary, Cosgrove Hall also licensed rights to a number of companies to produce a range of new anniversary merchandise including Blues Clothing (women's and girls' underwear and sleepwear) and Concept 2 Creation (collectible figurines).\n\n[[FremantleMedia]] launched a webshop run by Metrostar e-commerce where a wide variety of goods were for sale, including the CD Audio adaptation of two of the show's episodes using the original artists voices, released by Steve Deakin-Davies: The Ambition Company.\n\n=== Other appearances ===\n* ''[[The BFG (1989 film)|The BFG]]'' (1989): Makes a cameo appearance with Penfold in a poster in a boy's bedroom.\n* ''[[Victor and Hugo]]'' (1991): Appeared as himself in the episode titled \"French Exchange\".\n* ''South Park'' (2008): In the video, Danger Mouse is in Imaginationland. {{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Danger Mouse episodes}}\n\n==DVD releases==\n{{main|List of Danger Mouse home video releases}}\n\n==Broadcast history==\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2015}}\n<!--This section, particularly the list of international broadcast networks, is not in compliance with WP:TVINTL and is at risk of deletion.-->\nThe show has the initials 'DM' prominently emblazoned on his chest. This causes problems for those translating it into other languages, where a literal translation of the words 'Danger' and 'Mouse' do not have those initials; the [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scots Gaelic]] version, for example, calls the show (and the lead) ''Donnie Murdo'' (two given names unconnected either with mice or danger).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b062xb7t|title=BBC ALBA - Donnie Murdo/Danger Mouse|work=BBC}}</ref>\nHe was Dzielna Mysz (brave mouse) in [[Polish language|Polish]], Dundermusen (Thundermouse) in [[Swedish language|Swedish]], and ''Dare Dare Motus'' in [[French language|French]],<ref name=\"imdb.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081848/releaseinfo?ref_=tt_dt_dt#akas|title=Danger Mouse (1981\u20131992) : Release Info|website=IMDb.com|accessdate=2016-03-31}}</ref> \"Dare Dare\" being French slang for \"as fast as possible\".

He speaks 34 languages fluently, including some extraterrestrial ones. His skills are of a wide variety, including the ability to shatter metal with his voice, perform military style push-ups on his index finger, and reach a 7th level of meditation. He is also a practitioner of the ancient [[martial art]] of Kung Moggy. He is referred to as the \"White Wonder\" and \"Wretched Rodent\" by his nemesis, Baron Greenback. His catchphrases include \"Good grief\" when he becomes upset or shocked, \"Penfold, shush\" when his assistant makes a foolish remark, and \"Blast\" when his adventure inevitably goes awry. He was originally going to be brown; however, the creators thought that he and Penfold needed to be different colors.\n* Ernest Penfold <!-- S1 ep. 1 intro, also in captions for S2 --> (voiced by [[Terry Scott]]) is a timid, bespectacled hamster, and Danger Mouse's reluctant assistant and [[sidekick]]. He is often mistaken for a mole; however, Brian Cosgrove has stated Penfold is supposed to be a hamster.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://danger-mouse.net/cosgrove.html|title=Interview with Brian Cosgrove on danger-mouse.net|date=|accessdate=7 December 2012}}</ref> Penfold stands just over half the height of Danger Mouse, and always wears thick round glasses and a crumpled blue suit with a white shirt and a yellow and black striped tie. In the first episode, he is codenamed the Jigsaw \"because when he is faced with a problem, he goes to pieces.\"{{Ref|Episode|S1 ep 1}}\n<!--  original research, needs refs\nHe appears in every episode accompanying Danger Mouse, and he is often captured or getting himself into other dangerous situations before needing to be rescued by Danger Mouse. His main catchphrase is \"Crumbs, DM!\" and others include \"Oh, heck!\", \"Oh, fiddle!\" and \"Oh, carrots!\", all said when things go wrong. He also says \"Coming, Chief!\" when Danger Mouse wants to speak with him. Nevertheless, he appears to have some moral fibre, and is willing to resist Evil when things begin to go wrong\u2014at least temporarily. He is a self-proclaimed expert in the martial art referred to in the cartoon as \"kung moggy\", though his skills do not do him much good in practice. He almost always makes ridiculous responses, whether by misunderstanding or mistaking as a joke, to which DM tells him to \"shush\".\n-->\n* Colonel K (voiced by [[Edward Kelsey]]): Danger Mouse's boss; often mistaken for a [[walrus]], it was revealed in an issue of ''Look-in'' magazine that he is, in fact, a [[chinchilla]]. He previously worked for [[Special Branch]], where he was known as [[Special K]]. He is a champion [[piano]]-thrower, [[Commonwealth Realms orders and decorations|decorated]] [[judo]] expert, the first to climb [[Mount Everest]] on a [[pogo stick]], was once an [[Eskimo]], took up [[tap-dancing]], is a former [[kleptomaniac]], and cheats at [[croquet]]. During the last two seasons, he became more absent-minded, tending to frustrate both DM and Penfold with his tendency to ramble nonsense. Often when it is time for the Colonel to say \"over and out\", he forgets what the phrase is in a temporary case of memory loss. Other times, he becomes frustrated when Danger Mouse does not immediately respond, such as if he is in the middle of a yoga exercise.\n* [[Baron]] Silas Greenback (voiced by [[Edward Kelsey]]): The recurring [[villain]] and Danger Mouse's [[archenemy]]; a [[toad]] with a wheezy voice, although, sometimes, he was referred to as a [[frog]]. Known as Baron Greenteeth in the unbroadcast pilot episode. Commonly known as the \"Terrible Toad\". In America, \"Greenback\" is slang for dollar bill in many regions, adding to the sense of his commercial greed. Allegedly, he turned to a life of crime as a schoolboy when other children stole his bicycle and let all the air out of its tyres. In the 2015 revival series, the character was renamed Baron Silas von Greenback, and was given a German accent.\n* Stiletto (voiced by [[Brian Trueman]]): Greenback's henchman; a [[crow]]. He always called Greenback \"Barone\", [[Italian language|Italian]] for \"Baron\". In the original British version, he speaks with an Italian accent; this was changed to a [[Cockney]] accent for [[United States of America|U.S.]] distribution (i.e., [[Nickelodeon]]) to avoid offending Italian-Americans, and all references to his [[surname]] were removed as well, although the Italian word \"Barone\" was retained. In several episodes, a short silence after his first name is said and the next word is quite obvious. The original voicing has been restored on all U.S. VHS and DVD releases and during its Cheez TV run. His last name is Mafiosa.\n* Nero (sounds provided by [[David Jason]]): Greenback's pet. A fluffy white [[caterpillar]] (equivalent to the stereotypical white [[cat]] frequently associated with arch villains, particularly [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]]). He is a non-speaking character, although his noises and laugh are supplied by David Jason's voice sped up. Readily understood by Greenback and, less frequently, by Stiletto. At one time, he is shown to have a form of telekinesis after falling into one of Greenback's inventions, proving to be just as much a match to DM and Penfold as his master. However, he lost this power when he was drenched in water. In the special features of Danger Mouse cartoons, audiences were informed that Nero is actually the mastermind of Greenback's schemes.\n* The Narrator (voiced by [[David Jason]]): The unseen narrator, who occasionally interacts with the characters, sometimes to the point of halting the plot for one reason or another (in one episode, he accidentally sends Danger Mouse back in time). He often voices his disdain for the show and his job, to the point that he refuses outright to narrate some episodes altogether. He usually comments at the end of every episode when the credits roll before the end theme tune begins. These comments\u2014along with the episode breaks\u2014have been cut from some releases, greatly reducing the size of this character's part. His name is Isambard Sinclair.{{episode needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Supporting===\n* Flying Officer Buggles Pigeon (voiced by [[David Jason]]): Another of Colonel K's agents who came to the aid of Danger Mouse and Penfold in the episode, \"Chicken Run,\" and appeared in several episodes afterward.{{Ref|Episode|S1 ep. 4, 10}} His name is a reference to [[Biggles|James Bigglesworth]].{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n* Leatherhead (voiced by [[Terry Scott]]): Greenback's other crow henchman. Even less intelligent than Stiletto, he only appeared in several of the early episodes, where he spent most of his time reading comic books.{{Ref|Episode|S1 ep. 8}}\n* Agent 57: A master of disguise, appearing initially as an earthworm. Agent 57 has disguised himself so often that he forgot his original appearance.{{Ref|Episode|S1 ep. 8}} He gained the ability to alter his own [[molecular structure]] to transform into any appearance he wished. This ability went temporarily out of control in one episode when he contracted a [[common cold|cold]], causing him to involuntarily [[Shapeshifting|change shape]] whenever he [[sneeze]]d.{{episode needed|date=March 2020}}\n* Miss Boathook: Colonel K's secretary, only referred to by the colonel and never seen (though sometimes heard).{{Ref|Episode|S2 ep. 1}} In some versions, the Colonel's secretary is referred to as Miss Prentergast{{Ref|Episode|S2 ep. 5a}}<!-- bad luck eye pt. 1 -->  or Miss Hackett.\n* Count Duckula (voiced by [[David Jason]]): A fame-obsessed [[vampire]] [[duck]] who wants to appear in television. However, his utter lack of anything approaching talent makes his attempts to \"entertain\" rather terrifying (he has been known to use his \"act\" as a torture device). This resulted in a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series, titled ''[[Count Duckula]]'', starring the Count himself. The two versions of the character differ, however; the character featured in ''Danger Mouse'' is not a [[vegetarian]], makes far greater use of his vampiric magic, and has an accent consisting of a lisp and a stutter, as well as occasional stuttering and duck-like squawks and quacks.\n* Doctor Augustus P. [[Crumhorn]] III (voiced by [[Jimmy Hibbert]]): A mad scientist [[wolf]], he recurred as Danger Mouse's adversary less frequently than Baron Greenback (in four episodes in total). In one episode, he attempted to undermine Danger Mouse by metamorphosing into a [[Shirley Temple]] lookalike. In only one episode, \"Penfold Transformed\", as opposed to his stage name \"Augustus P. Crumhorn III\", he lists his full name as, \"Aloisius Julian Philibert Elphinstone Eugene [[Dionysis]] [[Barry Manilow]] Crumhorn\", omitting both Augustus and the III. Crumhorn and Greenback were at odds; once Crumhorn kidnapped Penfold and Penfold managed to escape simply because the two villains were too busy quarreling to notice his absence.\n* Fifi: Fifi is an unseen character mentioned occasionally throughout the show, but Danger Mouse is reluctant to discuss her. According to Cosgrove Hall, she is Danger Mouse's ex-girlfriend.\n* J. J. Quark: an antagonistic alien who claims possession of Earth based on a cosmic charter granted to his Great-great-great-great grandfather.\n* Grovell: J. J. Quark's obsequious robot flunkie who grovels whenever his name is mentioned, to Quark's consternation.\n* Penfold's Aunt (voiced by [[Brian Trueman]]): Penfold's formidable aunt from Abergavenny, Wales, who sends him cookies in the episode, \"The Statue of Liberty Caper\". The fact that she is Welsh is stated by the piece of a witch's broom in \"The Four Tasks of Danger Mouse\". The broom is her fifth cousin. She denies that Danger Mouse is a real secret agent and says that he and Penfold are just playing silly pretend games.\n* Professor Heinrich Von Squawkencluck (voiced by [[Edward Kelsey]]) [[Mad scientist]]/[[inventor]]/[[boffin]]. Inventor of the Mark III, Danger Mouse's [[flying car (fiction)|flying car]], and the [[Space Hopper]], his personal [[spacecraft]]. A [[Mole (animal)|mole]], despite his [[bird|avian]] name (which comes from his first appearance on the show, in which, he was engaged in [[hormone]] experiments to grow [[chickens]] to enormous sizes). He speaks in a broken [[German language|German]] accent. Penfold is naturally leery of the professor, as he often winds up on the wrong side of his experiments.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe show was created by Mark Hall<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-15792282|title=Danger Mouse co-creator Mark Hall dies|work=BBC News}}</ref> and [[Brian Cosgrove]] for their production company, [[Cosgrove Hall Films]]. Danger Mouse was based on Patrick McGoohan's lead role in ''[[Danger Man]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://danger-mouse.net/cosgrove.html|title=Club DM|work=danger-mouse.net}}</ref>\n\nThe show was intended to have a more serious tone as seen in the pilot episode but [[Mike Harding]] gave Brian Cosgrove and Mark Hall the idea to make the series silly. Mike said: \"The characters had got stuck in reality and were doing James Bond type things rooted in the solid real world. I argued that once you invented a Mouse Secret Agent then all of creation and a good chunk of not creation was his oyster. In other words we could be as barmy (crazy) as we wanted.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mikeharding.co.uk/tvradio/cosgrove-hall/|title=Cosgrove Hall|work=mikeharding.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nBy 1983, the show's viewing figures hit an all-time high of 21 million viewers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/image_galleries/cosgrove_hall_30_years_gallery.shtml?3|title=Cosgrove Hall: 30 years |work=BBC Manchester|publisher=BBC|date=|accessdate=1 June 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060308063921/http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/image_galleries/cosgrove_hall_30_years_gallery.shtml?3|archivedate=8 March 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://stv.tv/news/east-central/103700-rocking-it-up-at-the-inland-revenue/|title=Ooh-eck, Penfold are rocking it up at the Inland Revenue|website=STV News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24429892|title=How Danger Mouse became king of the TV ratings|date=11 October 2013|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nOn 4 June 1984, the show was the first British cartoon to appear on [[Nickelodeon]]\nand became one of the earliest ones to be in [[TV syndication|syndication]] in America,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/danger-mouse-remake-more-female-716877|title='Danger Mouse' Remake: More Female Characters Planned|last=Szalai|first=Georg|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref> as it appealed to both preteens and adults with its quick-witted English humour.<ref name=\"FNTVF\">{{cite book|last1=Hannah|first1=Warner|title=Fascinating TV Facts|edition=1|year=2004|publisher=Ted Smart|location=[[London]]|isbn=0-7535-0919-9|page=99}}</ref> It was often compared to American audiences as a British equivalent of ''[[The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show]]'', due to its gentle satire of politics and outrageous plots.\n\nIn the UK, [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[100 Greatest (UK TV series)|100 Greatest Kids' TV Shows]]'', the show came third, beaten only by ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest/kidstv/results.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020804015958/http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest/kidstv/results.html |title=100 Greatest Kids' TV Shows |publisher=channel4.com |archivedate=4 August 2002 |accessdate=26 August 2010}}</ref> It returned to terrestrial television after the [[BBC]] purchased episodes of it to broadcast in its daytime schedules with its first broadcast on 12 February 2007.<ref name=\"BFI\">[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/737309/index.html \"Dangermouse (1981-1992)\"].

This time-and-money saving device was cheerfully admitted by both Brian Cosgrove, who conceived the character and the show, and [[Brian Trueman]], who wrote almost all the scripts from the beginning.\n\n==In other media==\n===Comics===\nA long-running [[comic strip]] adaptation, written by [[Angus P. Allan]] and illustrated by [[Arthur Ranson]], ran in ''[[Look-in]]'' magazine and was [[Print syndication|syndicated]] in various other magazines. Ranson also provided some backdrops for the show. Allan and Ranson's work was highly appreciated by Cosgrove Hall, and the pair were awarded an \"Oh Goodness!, Oh Crikey!\" award in appreciation of their services. Some of Allan's stories were adapted for the show, although Allan's name was misspelled \"Angus Allen\". Artist Ranson later went on to illustrate [[Judge Anderson]] in the UK [[comic]] ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]''.\n\n===Video games===\nA series of [[video game]]s based on the character also appeared. The first were ''Danger Mouse in Double Trouble'' and ''Danger Mouse in the Black Forest Chateau'' (both in 1984) followed by ''Danger Mouse in Making Whoopee!'' in 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/index.php?cat=96&id=1247 |title=Danger Mouse in Double Trouble |publisher=SpectrumComputing |date= |accessdate=30 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/index.php?cat=96&id=1249 |title=Danger Mouse in the Black Forest Chateau |publisher=SpectrumComputing |date= |accessdate=30 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/index.php?cat=96&id=1248 |title=Danger Mouse in Making Whoopee! |publisher=SpectrumComputing |date= |accessdate=30 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nTwo mobile games were published by ZED Worldwide;  ''Danger Mouse: Quiz'' in 2010 and ''Danger Mouse'' in 2011.\n\n===Audiobooks===\nSome stories were also available as read-along cassettes with accompanying books. They were re-read by the cast for audio.\n\n===Merchandise===\nDuring its run, the show spawned a wide range of merchandise, including storybooks, hardback annuals, jigsaw puzzles, a [[Panini Group|Panini]] sticker album, [[View-Master]] reels, and of course, VHS releases. In the years since, products have continued to sell, often aimed at the now-adult audience which grew up with it, such as T-shirts, mugs, key rings, fridge magnets and posters. To coincide with the 25th anniversary, Cosgrove Hall also licensed rights to a number of companies to produce a range of new anniversary merchandise including Blues Clothing (women's and girls' underwear and sleepwear) and Concept 2 Creation (collectible figurines).\n\n[[FremantleMedia]] launched a webshop run by Metrostar e-commerce where a wide variety of goods were for sale, including the CD Audio adaptation of two of the show's episodes using the original artists voices, released by Steve Deakin-Davies: The Ambition Company.\n\n=== Other appearances ===\n* ''[[The BFG (1989 film)|The BFG]]'' (1989): Makes a cameo appearance with Penfold in a poster in a boy's bedroom.\n* ''[[Victor and Hugo]]'' (1991): Appeared as himself in the episode titled \"French Exchange\".\n* ''South Park'' (2008): In the video, Danger Mouse is in Imaginationland. {{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Danger Mouse episodes}}\n\n==DVD releases==\n{{main|List of Danger Mouse home video releases}}\n\n==Broadcast history==\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2015}}\n<!--This section, particularly the list of international broadcast networks, is not in compliance with WP:TVINTL and is at risk of deletion.-->\nThe show has the initials 'DM' prominently emblazoned on his chest.

He lives and works at Harefield Airfield, and he and Pippa are best friends. He can be cheeky and troublesome, but he works hard too, and continuously tries to please Lionel. He will also bravely come to the assistance of people in danger. He hates going through the heli-wash. He has [[Phobia]] about [[Missile]]s, and avoids doing so whenever he can. A white teddy bear named Snowy can almost always be seen carried in a pocket on Budgie's starboard. His catchphrase is \"Rocketing Rotors!\"\n* '''Pippa''' the Single-Engined Mono-Plane (voiced by [[Abigail MacVean]])  \u2014 Pippa (inspired by a [[Piper Warrior]] aircraft) is a small green single-engined [[monoplane]] with a tuft of blonde hair and a big pink bow on her top. She was the second aircraft to arrive at [[Harefield]] [[Airfield]], and at first, teased Budgie and called him a [[yo-yo]] ([[snail]] later on). After a race and several comparisons about who was the best, they both became firm friends. She enjoys helping out, and also loves using the [[carwash|heli-wash/plane wash]] (as opposed to Budgie).\n* '''Chuck''' the [[America]]n [[Helicopter]] (voiced by [[Kerry Shale]]) (was stated in the second TV episode as being a [[Boeing CH-47 Chinook]]) - is a twin-rotored helicopter, with what appears to be a crew cut under his cap. He comes from America and does not understand [[British English]] well. He sometimes gets cocky and likes to show off, but this led him to trouble when he disrupted an air show and finished up in a pond. He also has a bad habit of calling Lionel \"Captain\".\n* '''Lionel''' the Aircraft in Charge (voiced by [[Jeremy Nicholas (writer)|Jeremy Nicholas]]) - Lionel is the senior helicopter in the series (influenced by a [[Westland Lynx]]), sporting a modern-era pilot's cap, mustache and a collar (with his front landing gear resembling a tie). He does not take kindly to Budgie, Pippa, or especially Chuck causing trouble and making themselves nuisances, but he keeps things in order with his patient but firm ways. He insists on cleanliness from all aircraft at all times, and is nicer than what he appears to be. His catchphrase is \"Juddering joysticks!\"\n\n====Other aircraft====\n* Patsy the American stunt plane (was stated by Lionel as being a [[Pitt's Special]]).\n* Wally the old [[Supermarine Walrus]]\n* Jean Claude the pompous French [[Concorde]]\n* Jasper Jeer-jet the snobbish [[private jet]]. Jasper was a joker to start off and kept on radioing Harefield Airfield pretending there was an emergency, but when he really did need help in a storm, Budgie came to his rescue, and since then Jasper has realised it is not a good idea to play the fool all the time.\n* Henry the three-winged propeller-driven 1930s airliner\n* Olivia The [[Edgley Optica]]\n* Dougie The Police Helicopter (only in ''Eye in The Sky'')\n* The Emerald Helicopter (only in ''Eye in The Sky'')\n* Unnamed [[Boeing 747]] jet plane (Only in ''Double Trouble'')\n* A Very Naughtiest Version of Budgie\n* The naughty Piper plane, Pippa's \"double\" (only in ''Double Trouble'')\n* [[Aircraft Carrier]] Helicopter\n* Gloria The [[Glider (aircraft)|Glider]]\n* Mini Planes (only appeared in ''Deep Sleep'')\n* Three other gliders\n* Gus the Guppy (based on an [[Aero Spacelines Super Guppy]]), is a huge American [[Cargo aircraft|transport aircraft]].\n* Harvey the grey [[Royal Navy]] [[BAE Sea Harrier]] jet fighter.

He lives and works at Harefield Airfield, and he and Pippa are best friends. He can be cheeky and troublesome, but he works hard too, and continuously tries to please Lionel. He will also bravely come to the assistance of people in danger. He hates going through the heli-wash. He has [[Phobia]] about [[Missile]]s, and avoids doing so whenever he can. A white teddy bear named Snowy can almost always be seen carried in a pocket on Budgie's starboard. His catchphrase is \"Rocketing Rotors!\"\n* '''Pippa''' the Single-Engined Mono-Plane (voiced by [[Abigail MacVean]])  \u2014 Pippa (inspired by a [[Piper Warrior]] aircraft) is a small green single-engined [[monoplane]] with a tuft of blonde hair and a big pink bow on her top. She was the second aircraft to arrive at [[Harefield]] [[Airfield]], and at first, teased Budgie and called him a [[yo-yo]] ([[snail]] later on). After a race and several comparisons about who was the best, they both became firm friends. She enjoys helping out, and also loves using the [[carwash|heli-wash/plane wash]] (as opposed to Budgie).\n* '''Chuck''' the [[America]]n [[Helicopter]] (voiced by [[Kerry Shale]]) (was stated in the second TV episode as being a [[Boeing CH-47 Chinook]]) - is a twin-rotored helicopter, with what appears to be a crew cut under his cap. He comes from America and does not understand [[British English]] well. He sometimes gets cocky and likes to show off, but this led him to trouble when he disrupted an air show and finished up in a pond. He also has a bad habit of calling Lionel \"Captain\".\n* '''Lionel''' the Aircraft in Charge (voiced by [[Jeremy Nicholas (writer)|Jeremy Nicholas]]) - Lionel is the senior helicopter in the series (influenced by a [[Westland Lynx]]), sporting a modern-era pilot's cap, mustache and a collar (with his front landing gear resembling a tie). He does not take kindly to Budgie, Pippa, or especially Chuck causing trouble and making themselves nuisances, but he keeps things in order with his patient but firm ways. He insists on cleanliness from all aircraft at all times, and is nicer than what he appears to be. His catchphrase is \"Juddering joysticks!\"\n\n====Other aircraft====\n* Patsy the American stunt plane (was stated by Lionel as being a [[Pitt's Special]]).\n* Wally the old [[Supermarine Walrus]]\n* Jean Claude the pompous French [[Concorde]]\n* Jasper Jeer-jet the snobbish [[private jet]].

The series is set in Mr Grimes' Toy Factory, where imperfect dolls are thrown into a reject bin. While unobserved by human eyes, the dolls come to life and climb out of the reject bin to have adventures. The series was designed to encourage children to think positively about physical disabilities{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==History==\nThe series was produced for [[ITV Yorkshire|Yorkshire Television]] from 3 April 1986 to 20 December 1994. It was created by Melvyn Jacobson, with scripts, narration and music by [[Neil Innes]]. Yorkshire Television produced the first two series of ''The Raggy Dolls'' before awarding the commission to Orchid Productions Limited in 1987. This was the first programme Yorkshire Television commissioned from an independent production company, and Orchid Productions went on to produce over 100 more episodes of the series. The initial animator for Yorkshire TV was Roy Evans, and consequently after the move to Orchid Productions Mark Mason took over the role, animating and storyboarding 26 episodes, and storyboarding and directing other animators on a further 26 episodes before moving onto work on other children's shows and being replaced by Peter Hale from the 7th series onwards. The series was sold abroad to a number of other countries.\n\n==Characters ==\n\n===The Raggy Dolls===\n*'''Sad Sack''' \u2013 A sample of a design that was deemed too expensive to mass-produce; his appearance is somewhat different from that of the others. He is the oldest of the seven Raggy Dolls in the Reject Bin. As his name suggests, he is very gloomy and cynical, but he still values his friendship with the other dolls.\n*'''Dotty''' - As the oldest next to the lethargic Sad Sack, she sees herself as the leader of the group and is often very bossy. She is so named because she accidentally had paint spilt on her hair and clothing. Dotty's main catchphrase is: \"Good thinking!\"\n*'''Hi-Fi'''  \u2013 He converses with stammer due to him being dropped during testing. It was also stated in episode \"The Trouble with Claude\" that he was wired incorrectly, hence the stammer. He always wears headphones, which allow him to tune into radio and communication signals from seemingly any source.\n*'''Lucy''' \u2013 Her limbs are inadequately attached with nylon thread. She is shy and easily frightened, but always kind-hearted and loyal to her friends. She can be brave on occasion, as first seen in the episode \"Ghosts\". She speaks with a [[Derbyshire]] accent.\n*'''Back-To-Front'''  \u2013 He is a handyman doll with a backward-facing head (as a result of the manufacturer putting his head on the wrong-way round) and a love of machines. Always calm in a crisis, Back-To-Front's catchphrase is \"No problem!\".\n*'''Claude''' \u2013 A French doll, who, unlike his companions, is actually perfect in every way. He fell out of a box of dolls being shipped to France and was left behind, being put in the bin out of a lack of other places.  He speaks with a French accent, and sometimes alternates between speaking English and French. He also has a notable talent for cooking.\n*'''Princess''' \u2013 She should have been a beautiful princess doll, but the machine accidentally cut her hair and left her dress in rags. In the manner of a typical aristocrat, her voice is characterised by [[Phonological history of English fricatives and affricates#H-adding|H-adding]]. As the opening titles indicate, Princess is the youngest of the original seven Raggy Dolls.\n*'''Ragamuffin''' \u2013 A wandering traveller doll who had lost his owner and decided to spend his life taking in new sights and experiences. Introduced in the fifth series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://80scartoons.co.uk/the-raggy-dolls.html|title=Raggy Dolls|work=80scartoons.co.uk|accessdate=1 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Friends===\n*'''Pumpernickle''' \u2013 A Scarecrow who is a friend to the Raggy Dolls.\n*'''Edward''' \u2013 Mr Grimes's lost teddy bear who becomes a good friend to the Raggy Dolls.\n*'''Mr Marmalade''' \u2013 Mr Grimes's pet cat who has a playful trait.\n*'''Hercules''' \u2013 An old farmhorse.\n*'''Rupert the Roo''' \u2013 An Australian toy kangaroo who had been mailed from Australia until he had become a new friend to the Raggy Dolls.\n*'''Natasha''' \u2013 A Russian Doll bought by Mrs Grimes.\n\n===Humans===\n*'''Mr Oswald \"Ozzie\" Grimes''' \u2013 The owner of the toy factory.\n*'''Cynthia''' \u2013 Appeared later in the series to be Mr Grimes's love interest, and later wife.\n*'''Florrie Fosdyke''' \u2013 A kind cafeteria lady who's mostly very forgetful.\n*'''Farmer Brown''' \u2013 The farmer of One Pin Farm.\n*'''Ethel Grimes''' \u2013 Mr Grimes's sister.\n*''' Oz and Boz''' \u2013 Ethel's sons (hence Mr Grimes's nephews), known as the Terrible Twins.\n\n==Episodes==\n\n===Series overview===\n{{Series overview\n| color1     = #E34234\n| link1      = #Season 1 (1986-87)\n| episodes1  = 13\n| start1     = {{Start date|1986|4|3}}\n| end1       = {{End date|1987|2|26}}\n\n| color2     = #FBEC5D\n| link2      = #Season 2 (1987-88)\n| episodes2  = 13\n| start2     = {{Start date|1987|11|13}}\n| end2       = {{End date|1988|9|28}}\n\n| color3     = #29AB87\n| link3      = #Season 3 (1988-89)\n| episodes3  = 13\n| start3     = {{Start date|1988|11|16}}\n| end3       = {{End date|1989|8|30}}\n\n| color4     = #29AB12\n| link4      = #Season 4 (1989-90)\n| episodes4  = 13\n| start4     = {{Start date|1989|9|6}}\n| end4       = {{End date|1990|8|30}}\n\n| color5     = #01CD74\n| link5      = #Season 5 (1990)\n| episodes5  = 13\n| start5     = {{Start date|1990|9|6}}\n| end5       = {{End date|1990|12|20}}\n\n| color6     = #0047AB\n| link6      = #Season 6 (1991)\n| episodes6  = 13\n| start6     = {{Start date|1991|9|6}}\n| end6       = {{End date|1991|12|13}}\n\n| color7     = #4B0082\n| link7      = #Season 7 (1992)\n| episodes7  = 13\n| start7     = {{Start date|1992|9|8}}\n| end7       = {{End date|1992|12|8}}\n\n| color8     = #9966CC\n| link8      = #Season 8 (1993)\n| episodes8  = 10\n| start8     = {{Start date|1993|9|28}}\n| end8       = {{End date|1993|12|7}}\n\n| color9     = #DF73FF\n| link9      = #Season 9 (1994)\n| episodes9  = 10\n| start9     = {{Start date|1994|10|11}}\n| end9       = {{End date|1994|12|20}}\n}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=\"5\" style=\"background: #E34234;\"| Season 1\n|-\n!# !!

The series is set in Mr Grimes' Toy Factory, where imperfect dolls are thrown into a reject bin. While unobserved by human eyes, the dolls come to life and climb out of the reject bin to have adventures. The series was designed to encourage children to think positively about physical disabilities{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==History==\nThe series was produced for [[ITV Yorkshire|Yorkshire Television]] from 3 April 1986 to 20 December 1994. It was created by Melvyn Jacobson, with scripts, narration and music by [[Neil Innes]]. Yorkshire Television produced the first two series of ''The Raggy Dolls'' before awarding the commission to Orchid Productions Limited in 1987. This was the first programme Yorkshire Television commissioned from an independent production company, and Orchid Productions went on to produce over 100 more episodes of the series. The initial animator for Yorkshire TV was Roy Evans, and consequently after the move to Orchid Productions Mark Mason took over the role, animating and storyboarding 26 episodes, and storyboarding and directing other animators on a further 26 episodes before moving onto work on other children's shows and being replaced by Peter Hale from the 7th series onwards. The series was sold abroad to a number of other countries.\n\n==Characters ==\n\n===The Raggy Dolls===\n*'''Sad Sack''' \u2013 A sample of a design that was deemed too expensive to mass-produce; his appearance is somewhat different from that of the others. He is the oldest of the seven Raggy Dolls in the Reject Bin. As his name suggests, he is very gloomy and cynical, but he still values his friendship with the other dolls.\n*'''Dotty''' - As the oldest next to the lethargic Sad Sack, she sees herself as the leader of the group and is often very bossy. She is so named because she accidentally had paint spilt on her hair and clothing. Dotty's main catchphrase is: \"Good thinking!\"\n*'''Hi-Fi'''  \u2013 He converses with stammer due to him being dropped during testing. It was also stated in episode \"The Trouble with Claude\" that he was wired incorrectly, hence the stammer. He always wears headphones, which allow him to tune into radio and communication signals from seemingly any source.\n*'''Lucy''' \u2013 Her limbs are inadequately attached with nylon thread. She is shy and easily frightened, but always kind-hearted and loyal to her friends. She can be brave on occasion, as first seen in the episode \"Ghosts\". She speaks with a [[Derbyshire]] accent.\n*'''Back-To-Front'''  \u2013 He is a handyman doll with a backward-facing head (as a result of the manufacturer putting his head on the wrong-way round) and a love of machines. Always calm in a crisis, Back-To-Front's catchphrase is \"No problem!\".\n*'''Claude''' \u2013 A French doll, who, unlike his companions, is actually perfect in every way. He fell out of a box of dolls being shipped to France and was left behind, being put in the bin out of a lack of other places.  He speaks with a French accent, and sometimes alternates between speaking English and French. He also has a notable talent for cooking.\n*'''Princess''' \u2013 She should have been a beautiful princess doll, but the machine accidentally cut her hair and left her dress in rags. In the manner of a typical aristocrat, her voice is characterised by [[Phonological history of English fricatives and affricates#H-adding|H-adding]]. As the opening titles indicate, Princess is the youngest of the original seven Raggy Dolls.\n*'''Ragamuffin''' \u2013 A wandering traveller doll who had lost his owner and decided to spend his life taking in new sights and experiences. Introduced in the fifth series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://80scartoons.co.uk/the-raggy-dolls.html|title=Raggy Dolls|work=80scartoons.co.uk|accessdate=1 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Friends===\n*'''Pumpernickle''' \u2013 A Scarecrow who is a friend to the Raggy Dolls.\n*'''Edward''' \u2013 Mr Grimes's lost teddy bear who becomes a good friend to the Raggy Dolls.\n*'''Mr Marmalade''' \u2013 Mr Grimes's pet cat who has a playful trait.\n*'''Hercules''' \u2013 An old farmhorse.\n*'''Rupert the Roo''' \u2013 An Australian toy kangaroo who had been mailed from Australia until he had become a new friend to the Raggy Dolls.\n*'''Natasha''' \u2013 A Russian Doll bought by Mrs Grimes.\n\n===Humans===\n*'''Mr Oswald \"Ozzie\" Grimes''' \u2013 The owner of the toy factory.\n*'''Cynthia''' \u2013 Appeared later in the series to be Mr Grimes's love interest, and later wife.\n*'''Florrie Fosdyke''' \u2013 A kind cafeteria lady who's mostly very forgetful.\n*'''Farmer Brown''' \u2013 The farmer of One Pin Farm.\n*'''Ethel Grimes''' \u2013 Mr Grimes's sister.\n*''' Oz and Boz''' \u2013 Ethel's sons (hence Mr Grimes's nephews), known as the Terrible Twins.\n\n==Episodes==\n\n===Series overview===\n{{Series overview\n| color1     = #E34234\n| link1      = #Season 1 (1986-87)\n| episodes1  = 13\n| start1     = {{Start date|1986|4|3}}\n| end1       = {{End date|1987|2|26}}\n\n| color2     = #FBEC5D\n| link2      = #Season 2 (1987-88)\n| episodes2  = 13\n| start2     = {{Start date|1987|11|13}}\n| end2       = {{End date|1988|9|28}}\n\n| color3     = #29AB87\n| link3      = #Season 3 (1988-89)\n| episodes3  = 13\n| start3     = {{Start date|1988|11|16}}\n| end3       = {{End date|1989|8|30}}\n\n| color4     = #29AB12\n| link4      = #Season 4 (1989-90)\n| episodes4  = 13\n| start4     = {{Start date|1989|9|6}}\n| end4       = {{End date|1990|8|30}}\n\n| color5     = #01CD74\n| link5      = #Season 5 (1990)\n| episodes5  = 13\n| start5     = {{Start date|1990|9|6}}\n| end5       = {{End date|1990|12|20}}\n\n| color6     = #0047AB\n| link6      = #Season 6 (1991)\n| episodes6  = 13\n| start6     = {{Start date|1991|9|6}}\n| end6       = {{End date|1991|12|13}}\n\n| color7     = #4B0082\n| link7      = #Season 7 (1992)\n| episodes7  = 13\n| start7     = {{Start date|1992|9|8}}\n| end7       = {{End date|1992|12|8}}\n\n| color8     = #9966CC\n| link8      = #Season 8 (1993)\n| episodes8  = 10\n| start8     = {{Start date|1993|9|28}}\n| end8       = {{End date|1993|12|7}}\n\n| color9     = #DF73FF\n| link9      = #Season 9 (1994)\n| episodes9  = 10\n| start9     = {{Start date|1994|10|11}}\n| end9       = {{End date|1994|12|20}}\n}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=\"5\" style=\"background: #E34234;\"| Season 1\n|-\n!# !!

The programme is centred on four pre-school aged characters, known as the \"Tweenies\", playing, singing, dancing and learning in a fictional nursery in [[England]]. They are cared for by two adult Tweenies and two dogs. \n\n390 episodes were broadcast between 6 September 1999 and 25 July 2002. In 2000, the show won a [[BAFTA]] award for Best Pre-school Live Action series, and singles featuring exclusive songs spent some weeks in the charts during the early 2000s. The series premiered on the [[BBC]]'s children's block, and was repeated on [[CBeebies]] from the channel's launch in 2002 until 2016. It was also shown on [[Noggin (brand)|Noggin]] in the United States and in other countries worldwide.\n\n==Overview and history==\nThe idea for the programme came from Iain Lauchlan and [[Will Brenton]], a pair with a track record of being involved in BBC children's programming. Together with Karl Woolley and Helen Cadwallader, they set up Tell-Tale Productions at Elstree Film Studios in Hertfordshire. Iain Lauchlan was a presenter on ''[[Play School (British TV series)|Play School]]'', ''[[Fingermouse]]'' and ''[[Playdays]]'', meeting Brenton, a [[Television director|director]], writer and also a [[Television presenter|presenter]], during the latter. Together they started producing two of the ''[[Playdays]]'' strands before forming their own production companies Tell-Tale Productions and, more recently, Wish Films. They also created ''[[Fun Song Factory|The Fun Song Factory]]'', ''[[Boo! (TV series)|Boo!]]'', ''[[BB3B]]'', ''[[Jim Jam and Sunny]]'', ''[[Basil Hair The Squirrel]]'' and ''[[Entertainment Right's The Magical Lives of Toys]]''.\n\n''Tweenies'' is a production of Tell-Tale Productions in association with the BBC. Animation for the show was produced by A Productions, an animation studio based in [[Bristol]], England, with Ealing Animation providing some animation in a few early episodes. [[Computer animation]] for the series was provided by ''Clockwork Digital'', with Ben Mars animating Mungo, the computer creature who appears in some later episodes.\n\nEpisodes consist of a mixture of story, song and creative activity. Music plays an important part in the programme and children are encouraged to join in with songs and actions.\n\nThe programme is set in a nursery in [[England]] attended by the four Tweenies themselves: Bella, Milo, Fizz and the youngest, Jake. They are in the care of two adults, Max and Judy, and two dogs, Doodles and Izzles.\n\nThe show includes a \"Tweenie Clock\", with five circular lights arranged in a [[pentagon]]al shape with the lights denoting \"News Time\" \u2013 Orange, \"Messy Time\" \u2013 Blue, \"Song Time\" \u2013 Yellow, \"Telly Time\" \u2013 Green and \"Story Time\" \u2013 Red. \"Surprise Time\" is a special time determined when all five lights glow. A button at the centre of the clock (Purple) is pressed to select the activity that will be undertaken next.\n\nIt was formerly shown on [[CBeebies]], from 11 February 2002 until 1 April 2016. Like a number of other CBeebies programmes, a live stage version of the show has toured in the UK. The most recent tour, ''Top of the Tots'', toured the British Isles during 2009, the series' 10th anniversary. In addition, the tour also played several shows in Hong Kong in late September and early October 2009. The Tweenies were also regulars on the annual CBeebies Live tours around the British Isles. Between 2003 and 2005, there was also a ''Tweenies'' theme park,  at [[Alton Towers]] in the Cred Street section aimed at younger children, which replaced the ''[[Barney & Friends|Barney]]'' section and then was removed in favour of ''[[Bob the Builder]]''. In 2000, ''Tweenies'' won two awards: Best PreSchool Educational Program and Best Live Action PreSchool Programme.\n\nThe original prototypes for the Tweenies characters were designed by Sally Preisig of Mimics Productions; they were later re-scaled into two sizes for the characters shown on the series. In addition, Preisig also designed the character costumes and was co-constructor/developer for the Tweenies' full-size puppets. The costume fabric comes from the UK and was imported and dyed into their present colours; it is about the same thickness as fleece jumpers.\n\n[[Neal Scanlan]] Studios (Babe, Star Wars, etc.), made the Animatronic Tweenie heads.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main characters===\nThe Tweenies consist of Bella, Milo, Fizz, Jake, Doodles, Izzles, Max, Judy, and are sometimes joined by Max's sister Polly. Other characters have appeared occasionally, including Milo's uncle, Mickey, his father, Jake's mother, Fizz's mother and father and Bella's grandmother. There have also been several animated characters.\nThe four main characters appeared in the  first episode \"Tweenie Band\", which was filmed on 3 August 1998 at [[Elstree Studios]] & aired on 6 September 1999.\nThe Tweenies were played by only one set of actors, while the voices and animatronics were provided by other actors. Unless otherwise indicated, all the following actors and voice talent were in the show from 1999 until its last episode, \"What Makes Summer?\" on 25 July 2002.\n\n* Bella (operated by [[Tamsin Heatley]] and sometimes [[Esther Rose Featherstone|Esther Collins]]; voiced by Sally Preisig 1999-2000, Emma Weaver 2000-2002 in the UK, [[Alyson Court]] in the US) is a five-year-old blue-skinned girl with blonde hair, usually accompanied with a red hair ribbon. As the oldest and tallest of the Tweenies, she has a very bossy attitude and likes her own way. Sometimes she causes things to go wrong with her overconfidence, but she apologises for her mistakes. Although Bella comes across bossy she is very helpful and caring to the younger Tweenies, in particular Jake; who she tends to look after whenever he is upset or in need. She loves reading, painting and acting. Her best friend is Fizz.\n* Milo (operated by C.H. Beck 1999-2000, Matthew Lyons/Kate Ryan 2000\u20132002; voiced by [[Bob Golding]] in the UK, [[Tracey Moore]] in the US) is a four-year-old purple-skinned boy with black hair. He is energetic, friendly and cheerful, though sometimes impulsive. He loves football and magic. His favorite colour is blue. He has a brother named Dean and an uncle named Mickey. He is best friends with Jake and often treats him like a little brother.\n* Fizz (operated by Jenny Hutchinson 1999-2000, Angela Reynolds 2000, Francesca Anderson 2001\u20132002; voiced by Colleen Daley in the UK, [[Lisa Yamanaka]] in the US) is a four-year-old yellow-skinned girl with brown beaded hair. She is mild-mannered and sometimes shy, but can get whiny and stroppy for the smallest reasons. Fizz's best friend is Bella. She loves ballet, dressing up, the colour pink and playing with dolls.\n* Jake (operated by Samantha Dodd 1999-2002 voiced by [[Justin Fletcher]] in the UK, [[Colin O'Meara]] in the US) is a three-year-old orange-skinned boy with a blonde [[Mohawk hairstyle|Mohican]]. Being the youngest Tweenie, he sometimes feels left out and excluded from the other Tweenies' games when he is not big enough to join in. He is sweet and has a close bond with Doodles, but he sometimes shows signs of being homesick and is prone to temper tantrums when frustrated. He will often turn to Bella or Doodles for support or advice when sad or upset. He sometimes gets words mixed up. He loves being a superhero, playing pretend and catch. His best friend is Milo.\n* Max (operated by Simon Grover/Matthew Lyons (some episodes); voiced by Bob Golding in the UK, James Rankin in the US) is a pink-skinned, middle-aged man who is one of the two managers of the playgroup of the Tweenies. He speaks with a slight [[Yorkshire]] accent. He loves trains, animals and exploring the outside world. Max is the stricter one of the grown-ups. \n* Judy Finnigan (operated by Simon Grover/Sinead Rushe (outside); voiced by Sinead Rushe in the UK, Caroly Larson in the US) is a green-skinned woman who is the other of the playgroup managers. She loves gardening, reading and being creative. She speaks with a [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] accent.\n* Doodles (operated by Alan Riley and John Tobias; voiced by Justin Fletcher in the UK, James Rankin in the US) is a red and yellow male dog. Doodles is a very friendly, calm dog. He loves going for walks with Max and can often be seen looking out for Jake.\n* Izzles (operated by Fiona Watkins; voiced by Colleen Daley) is a purple and white female dog, who was first introduced in 2001. Unlike Doodles she is a puppy and therefore a lot younger and very energetic. At first her antics were not to the Tweenies liking, more so Jake but she has since calmed down and settled in. The girls often like to dress her up in fancy stuff. She is also a companion for Doodles.\n\n===Recurring characters===\n* Bella's Grandma (operated by Matthew Lyons; voiced by Tamsin Heatley/Colleen Daley) is another blue-skinned Character who only appeared in Jake And The Beanstalk, \"I Can't Get To Sleep\" (voice only) and \"Weddings are Fun\" (physical appearance). She has the responsibility for Bella when her parents got divorced. They go out on day outs on the weekend because she has lots and lots of money. She also had a keyworker/husband named Peter, who speaks with a [[Cockney]] accent and has seen Bella a lot of times since she was born.\n* Bella's Grandpa (operated by John Tobias; voiced by Bob Golding) is also a blue-skinned character who only appeared in \"Happy Grandparents Day\". He shares the same voice with Max but with a lowered voice and a Cockney accent instead of a Northern one. He also has lots of money and pennies and they go on day outs during the weekends. He also has magic fingers for when he says snap the magic will begin, he also has the responsibility for Bella.\n* Polly (operated by Kathy Ryan; voiced by Colleen Daley) is a pink skinned character that appeared in \"Oh I Forgot\", It's The Thought That Counts\", \"Teamwork\", \"Weddings are Fun\" and \"Happy Grandparents Day\". She is Max's sister and also a keyworker to Fizz's mum and dad. When they were kids, they used to live by the seaside and always went to the pier for the promenades the pier holds. When she goes to the playgroup for visits, she brings a story and some sweets along with her.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Tweenies episodes}}\n{{:List of Tweenies episodes}}\n\nThe ''Tweenies'' aired its first episode ''Tweenie Band'' on 6 September 1999 on its original programme block [[CBBC]] and last aired on 25 July 2002 with ''What Makes Summer?'' on its former channel [[CBeebies]]. In total, there are 390 episodes. There have been special episodes, such as a series of ''Be Safe with the Tweenies'' and expanded 40 minute episodes.\n\nEpisode 252, ''Favourite Songs'', which first aired in March 2001 was banned by the [[BBC]] in January 2013 after the corporation received 216 complaints about a scene in a repeat of a ''[[Top Of The Pops]]''-themed parody episode where the character Max appears dressed as the late disgraced TV presenter [[Jimmy Savile]]. The BBC had stopped the ''Tweenies'' from being repeated altogether on CBeebies for four months due to the controversy. The episodes then started being repeated again from June 2013 until April 2016.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-21108337|title=BBC receives 216 complaints for Tweenies Jimmy Savile spoof|date=2013-01-21|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-07-25|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===Albums===\n<small>Data from AllMusicCharts.com</small>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n!Title\n!Entered chart (UK)\n!Peak position (UK)\n!Weeks on chart (UK)\n|-\n|''Friends Forever''\n|25 November 2000\n|align=center|56\n|align=center|4\n|-\n|''The Christmas Album''\n|1 December 2001\n|align=center|34\n|align=center|5\n|-\n|''Everybody Dance''\n|align=center|--\n|align=center|--\n|align=center|--\n|-\n|''Greatest Hits''<br/>(double CD)\n|align=center|--\n|align=center|--\n|align=center|--\n|}\n\n===Singles===\n<small>Data from AllMusicCharts.com</small>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n!Title\n!Entered chart (UK)\n!Peak position (UK)\n!Weeks on chart (UK)\n!Sent to [[CBeebies]] Album\n|-\n|\"No. 1\"\n|11 November 2000\n|align=center|5\n|align=center|24\n|Yes\n|-\n|\"Best Friends Forever\"\n|31 March 2001\n|align=center|12\n|align=center|11\n|Yes\n|-\n|\"Do the Lollipop\"\n|4 August 2001\n|align=center|17\n|align=center|8\n|No\n|-\n|\"I Believe in Christmas\"\n|15 December 2001\n|align=center|9\n|align=center|6\n|No\n|-\n|\"Bananas\"\n|14 September 2001\n|align=center|23\n|align=center|5\n|No\n|-\n|\"[[Have Fun, Go Mad]]\"\n|14 September 2002\n|align=center|20\n|align=center|8\n|Yes\n|}\n==Broadcast==\n{{prose|section|date=May 2014}}\n* [[CBeebies]] (UK) \u2013 11 February 2002 \u2013 1 April 2016\n* [[BBC1]] (UK) \u2013 6 September 1999 \u2013 15 December 2004\n* [[BBC2]] (UK) \u2013 6 September 1999 \u2013 18 December 2009\n* [[Noggin (brand)|Noggin]] (US) \u2013 2003 \u2013 2005\n* [[Universal Kids|PBS Kids Sprout]] (US) - 2005-2009\n* [[Disney Junior]] (United States) \u2013 28 September 2009 \u2013 11 December 2011\n* [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] (Australia) \u2013 4 July 2000 \u2013 February 2003\n* [[ABC Kids Channel|ABC Kids]] (Australia) \u2013 August 2001 \u2013 27 June 2003\n* [[CBeebies]] (Australia)\n* [[TV Asahi]] (Japan) \u2013 2000 \u2013 2007\n* [[Boomerang (Thai TV channel)|Boomerang]] (Thailand) \u2013 2002 \u2013 2005\n* [[Russia-1]] (Russia) \u2013 2002 \u2013 2004\n* [[Network 2]] (''[[The Den (Ireland)|The Den]]'') (Ireland)\n* [[TVNZ 2|TV2]] (New Zealand)\n* [[Prime (New Zealand)|Prime]] (New Zealand)\n* [[Barnkanalen|SVT Barnkanalen]] (Sweden)\n* [[e.tv]] (South Africa)\n* [[Kids Central]] (Singapore)\n* [[TV2 (Malaysia)|TV2]] (Malaysia)\n* [[Dubai 33]] (U.A.E.)\n* [[e-Junior]] (U.A.E.)\n* [[City 7 Dubai|City 7]] (U.A.E.)\n* [[MBC 3]] (Middle East)\n* [[Nickelodeon Arabia|Nickelodeon]] (Middle East)\n* [[Seychelles Broadcasting Corporation|SBC]] (Seychelles)\n* [[Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation|ZBC]] (Zimbabwe)\n* Channel 2 (Zimbabwe)\n* [[TVB Pearl]] (Hong Kong)\n* [[Television Malta|TVM]] (Malta)\n* [[TV Africa]] (Ghana)\n* [[BBC Kids]] (Canada)\n\n==Live shows==\nThe ''Tweenies'' went live on various occasions during the height of the programmes success from 1999 until 2003.

The series premiered on the [[BBC]]'s children's block, and was repeated on [[CBeebies]] from the channel's launch in 2002 until 2016. It was also shown on [[Noggin (brand)|Noggin]] in the United States and in other countries worldwide.\n\n==Overview and history==\nThe idea for the programme came from Iain Lauchlan and [[Will Brenton]], a pair with a track record of being involved in BBC children's programming. Together with Karl Woolley and Helen Cadwallader, they set up Tell-Tale Productions at Elstree Film Studios in Hertfordshire. Iain Lauchlan was a presenter on ''[[Play School (British TV series)|Play School]]'', ''[[Fingermouse]]'' and ''[[Playdays]]'', meeting Brenton, a [[Television director|director]], writer and also a [[Television presenter|presenter]], during the latter. Together they started producing two of the ''[[Playdays]]'' strands before forming their own production companies Tell-Tale Productions and, more recently, Wish Films. They also created ''[[Fun Song Factory|The Fun Song Factory]]'', ''[[Boo! (TV series)|Boo!]]'', ''[[BB3B]]'', ''[[Jim Jam and Sunny]]'', ''[[Basil Hair The Squirrel]]'' and ''[[Entertainment Right's The Magical Lives of Toys]]''.\n\n''Tweenies'' is a production of Tell-Tale Productions in association with the BBC. Animation for the show was produced by A Productions, an animation studio based in [[Bristol]], England, with Ealing Animation providing some animation in a few early episodes. [[Computer animation]] for the series was provided by ''Clockwork Digital'', with Ben Mars animating Mungo, the computer creature who appears in some later episodes.\n\nEpisodes consist of a mixture of story, song and creative activity. Music plays an important part in the programme and children are encouraged to join in with songs and actions.\n\nThe programme is set in a nursery in [[England]] attended by the four Tweenies themselves: Bella, Milo, Fizz and the youngest, Jake. They are in the care of two adults, Max and Judy, and two dogs, Doodles and Izzles.\n\nThe show includes a \"Tweenie Clock\", with five circular lights arranged in a [[pentagon]]al shape with the lights denoting \"News Time\" \u2013 Orange, \"Messy Time\" \u2013 Blue, \"Song Time\" \u2013 Yellow, \"Telly Time\" \u2013 Green and \"Story Time\" \u2013 Red. \"Surprise Time\" is a special time determined when all five lights glow. A button at the centre of the clock (Purple) is pressed to select the activity that will be undertaken next.\n\nIt was formerly shown on [[CBeebies]], from 11 February 2002 until 1 April 2016. Like a number of other CBeebies programmes, a live stage version of the show has toured in the UK. The most recent tour, ''Top of the Tots'', toured the British Isles during 2009, the series' 10th anniversary. In addition, the tour also played several shows in Hong Kong in late September and early October 2009. The Tweenies were also regulars on the annual CBeebies Live tours around the British Isles. Between 2003 and 2005, there was also a ''Tweenies'' theme park,  at [[Alton Towers]] in the Cred Street section aimed at younger children, which replaced the ''[[Barney & Friends|Barney]]'' section and then was removed in favour of ''[[Bob the Builder]]''. In 2000, ''Tweenies'' won two awards: Best PreSchool Educational Program and Best Live Action PreSchool Programme.\n\nThe original prototypes for the Tweenies characters were designed by Sally Preisig of Mimics Productions; they were later re-scaled into two sizes for the characters shown on the series. In addition, Preisig also designed the character costumes and was co-constructor/developer for the Tweenies' full-size puppets. The costume fabric comes from the UK and was imported and dyed into their present colours; it is about the same thickness as fleece jumpers.\n\n[[Neal Scanlan]] Studios (Babe, Star Wars, etc.), made the Animatronic Tweenie heads.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main characters===\nThe Tweenies consist of Bella, Milo, Fizz, Jake, Doodles, Izzles, Max, Judy, and are sometimes joined by Max's sister Polly. Other characters have appeared occasionally, including Milo's uncle, Mickey, his father, Jake's mother, Fizz's mother and father and Bella's grandmother. There have also been several animated characters.\nThe four main characters appeared in the  first episode \"Tweenie Band\", which was filmed on 3 August 1998 at [[Elstree Studios]] & aired on 6 September 1999.\nThe Tweenies were played by only one set of actors, while the voices and animatronics were provided by other actors. Unless otherwise indicated, all the following actors and voice talent were in the show from 1999 until its last episode, \"What Makes Summer?\" on 25 July 2002.\n\n* Bella (operated by [[Tamsin Heatley]] and sometimes [[Esther Rose Featherstone|Esther Collins]]; voiced by Sally Preisig 1999-2000, Emma Weaver 2000-2002 in the UK, [[Alyson Court]] in the US) is a five-year-old blue-skinned girl with blonde hair, usually accompanied with a red hair ribbon. As the oldest and tallest of the Tweenies, she has a very bossy attitude and likes her own way. Sometimes she causes things to go wrong with her overconfidence, but she apologises for her mistakes. Although Bella comes across bossy she is very helpful and caring to the younger Tweenies, in particular Jake; who she tends to look after whenever he is upset or in need. She loves reading, painting and acting. Her best friend is Fizz.\n* Milo (operated by C.H. Beck 1999-2000, Matthew Lyons/Kate Ryan 2000\u20132002; voiced by [[Bob Golding]] in the UK, [[Tracey Moore]] in the US) is a four-year-old purple-skinned boy with black hair. He is energetic, friendly and cheerful, though sometimes impulsive. He loves football and magic. His favorite colour is blue. He has a brother named Dean and an uncle named Mickey. He is best friends with Jake and often treats him like a little brother.\n* Fizz (operated by Jenny Hutchinson 1999-2000, Angela Reynolds 2000, Francesca Anderson 2001\u20132002; voiced by Colleen Daley in the UK, [[Lisa Yamanaka]] in the US) is a four-year-old yellow-skinned girl with brown beaded hair. She is mild-mannered and sometimes shy, but can get whiny and stroppy for the smallest reasons. Fizz's best friend is Bella. She loves ballet, dressing up, the colour pink and playing with dolls.\n* Jake (operated by Samantha Dodd 1999-2002 voiced by [[Justin Fletcher]] in the UK, [[Colin O'Meara]] in the US) is a three-year-old orange-skinned boy with a blonde [[Mohawk hairstyle|Mohican]]. Being the youngest Tweenie, he sometimes feels left out and excluded from the other Tweenies' games when he is not big enough to join in. He is sweet and has a close bond with Doodles, but he sometimes shows signs of being homesick and is prone to temper tantrums when frustrated. He will often turn to Bella or Doodles for support or advice when sad or upset. He sometimes gets words mixed up. He loves being a superhero, playing pretend and catch. His best friend is Milo.\n* Max (operated by Simon Grover/Matthew Lyons (some episodes); voiced by Bob Golding in the UK, James Rankin in the US) is a pink-skinned, middle-aged man who is one of the two managers of the playgroup of the Tweenies. He speaks with a slight [[Yorkshire]] accent. He loves trains, animals and exploring the outside world. Max is the stricter one of the grown-ups. \n* Judy Finnigan (operated by Simon Grover/Sinead Rushe (outside); voiced by Sinead Rushe in the UK, Caroly Larson in the US) is a green-skinned woman who is the other of the playgroup managers. She loves gardening, reading and being creative. She speaks with a [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] accent.\n* Doodles (operated by Alan Riley and John Tobias; voiced by Justin Fletcher in the UK, James Rankin in the US) is a red and yellow male dog. Doodles is a very friendly, calm dog. He loves going for walks with Max and can often be seen looking out for Jake.\n* Izzles (operated by Fiona Watkins; voiced by Colleen Daley) is a purple and white female dog, who was first introduced in 2001. Unlike Doodles she is a puppy and therefore a lot younger and very energetic. At first her antics were not to the Tweenies liking, more so Jake but she has since calmed down and settled in. The girls often like to dress her up in fancy stuff. She is also a companion for Doodles.\n\n===Recurring characters===\n* Bella's Grandma (operated by Matthew Lyons; voiced by Tamsin Heatley/Colleen Daley) is another blue-skinned Character who only appeared in Jake And The Beanstalk, \"I Can't Get To Sleep\" (voice only) and \"Weddings are Fun\" (physical appearance). She has the responsibility for Bella when her parents got divorced. They go out on day outs on the weekend because she has lots and lots of money. She also had a keyworker/husband named Peter, who speaks with a [[Cockney]] accent and has seen Bella a lot of times since she was born.\n* Bella's Grandpa (operated by John Tobias; voiced by Bob Golding) is also a blue-skinned character who only appeared in \"Happy Grandparents Day\". He shares the same voice with Max but with a lowered voice and a Cockney accent instead of a Northern one. He also has lots of money and pennies and they go on day outs during the weekends. He also has magic fingers for when he says snap the magic will begin, he also has the responsibility for Bella.\n* Polly (operated by Kathy Ryan; voiced by Colleen Daley) is a pink skinned character that appeared in \"Oh I Forgot\", It's The Thought That Counts\", \"Teamwork\", \"Weddings are Fun\" and \"Happy Grandparents Day\". She is Max's sister and also a keyworker to Fizz's mum and dad. When they were kids, they used to live by the seaside and always went to the pier for the promenades the pier holds. When she goes to the playgroup for visits, she brings a story and some sweets along with her.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Tweenies episodes}}\n{{:List of Tweenies episodes}}\n\nThe ''Tweenies'' aired its first episode ''Tweenie Band'' on 6 September 1999 on its original programme block [[CBBC]] and last aired on 25 July 2002 with ''What Makes Summer?'' on its former channel [[CBeebies]].

At the start of each episode Huxley would be in his bedroom talking to Sam the squawking seagull and wondering about something. He would open his big suitcase of dress-up clothes, try something on and say, \"Hmmm, I wonder\". The picture would fade and be taken away into his daydreams for the rest of the story.\n\nIn the dream, Sam the Seagull would be able to speak, in a [[Cockney]] accent, and there were many other varied characters such as:\n* Vile Vincent, the vampire pig-butler\n* Horace, a hamster and something of a con artist\n* Cuddles, a fanged green beast\n* Sydney, a snake with a lisp\n\nThe adventures took Huxley and the gang to many places, as long as there was food nearby. Food was close to Huxley's heart. Upon the conclusion of the daydream, Huxley would return to reality and find a memento from the story had mysteriously returned with him.\n\nWhat was curious about the show is that while Sam the Seagull is, as in reality, only able to speak English in dream sequences and Huxley, who is clearly a pig, is able to speak in everyday life.\n\n==Episodes==\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" width=99%\n|-\n! style=\"background: #CCCCFF\" width=\"3%\" | '''#'''\n! style=\"background: #CCCCFF\" width=\"25%\"| '''Title'''\n! style=\"background: #CCCCFF\" width=\"12%\"| '''Broadcast Date'''\n! style=\"background: #CCCCFF\" | '''Summary'''\n|-\n|'''1'''|| '''Huxley Pig at the Circus''' || 5 June 1989 || Huxley Pig rumages through his clothes and pulls out a clown suit and dreams about being at the circus by sharing six 'Knock, Knock' jokes with Horace and struggles on the high wire but doesn't do too bad in the end.\n|-\n|'''2'''|| '''Huxley Pig and the Haunted House''' || 12 June 1989 || Huxley Pig looks through a picture book about a haunted house and dreams of him and Sam visiting one called Holiday Haunts, where they meet Horace the rodent agent, the vampire-butler Vile Vincent, Cuddles the big green monster who cooks them 'Monster Burgers' to which they didn't really like, but it hurts Cuddles's feelings, then they play 'Swallow My Leader' to cheer Cuddles up.\n|-\n|'''3'''|| '''Huxley Pig on a Desert Island''' || 19 June 1989 || While playing with his toy boat and sailor suit, Huxley dreams of him and Sam sailing at sea for real.

At the start of each episode Huxley would be in his bedroom talking to Sam the squawking seagull and wondering about something. He would open his big suitcase of dress-up clothes, try something on and say, \"Hmmm, I wonder\". The picture would fade and be taken away into his daydreams for the rest of the story.\n\nIn the dream, Sam the Seagull would be able to speak, in a [[Cockney]] accent, and there were many other varied characters such as:\n* Vile Vincent, the vampire pig-butler\n* Horace, a hamster and something of a con artist\n* Cuddles, a fanged green beast\n* Sydney, a snake with a lisp\n\nThe adventures took Huxley and the gang to many places, as long as there was food nearby. Food was close to Huxley's heart. Upon the conclusion of the daydream, Huxley would return to reality and find a memento from the story had mysteriously returned with him.\n\nWhat was curious about the show is that while Sam the Seagull is, as in reality, only able to speak English in dream sequences and Huxley, who is clearly a pig, is able to speak in everyday life.\n\n==Episodes==\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" width=99%\n|-\n! style=\"background: #CCCCFF\" width=\"3%\" | '''#'''\n! style=\"background: #CCCCFF\" width=\"25%\"| '''Title'''\n! style=\"background: #CCCCFF\" width=\"12%\"| '''Broadcast Date'''\n! style=\"background: #CCCCFF\" | '''Summary'''\n|-\n|'''1'''|| '''Huxley Pig at the Circus''' || 5 June 1989 || Huxley Pig rumages through his clothes and pulls out a clown suit and dreams about being at the circus by sharing six 'Knock, Knock' jokes with Horace and struggles on the high wire but doesn't do too bad in the end.\n|-\n|'''2'''|| '''Huxley Pig and the Haunted House''' || 12 June 1989 || Huxley Pig looks through a picture book about a haunted house and dreams of him and Sam visiting one called Holiday Haunts, where they meet Horace the rodent agent, the vampire-butler Vile Vincent, Cuddles the big green monster who cooks them 'Monster Burgers' to which they didn't really like, but it hurts Cuddles's feelings, then they play 'Swallow My Leader' to cheer Cuddles up.\n|-\n|'''3'''|| '''Huxley Pig on a Desert Island''' || 19 June 1989 || While playing with his toy boat and sailor suit, Huxley dreams of him and Sam sailing at sea for real.

The first series, broadcast on [[BBC One]] in 1996, was developed and jointly produced by [[Keith Scholey]], who would go on to become Head of the BBC's [[BBC Natural History Unit|Natural History Unit]].<ref>{{cite magazine | url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/terrestrial/2008/04/bbc_factual_boss_quits.html | title=BBC factual boss quits |magazine=Broadcast Now |date=2008-04-21 |accessdate=2008-08-31}}</ref> Eight series have followed, most recently ''Big Cat Live'', a live broadcast from the Mara in 2008.\n\nThe original presenters, [[Jonathan Scott (zoologist)|Jonathan Scott]] and [[Simon King (television)|Simon King]], were joined by [[Saba Douglas-Hamilton]] from 2002 onwards. [[Kate Silverton]] and [[Jackson Looseyia]] were added to the presenting team for ''Big Cat Live''.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Background==\n\nThe [[BBC Natural History Unit]] originally wanted to film in the [[Serengeti National Park]] in [[Tanzania]], but when this proved too expensive, they switched to Kenya.{{citation needed|date=January 2009}} Filming was timed to coincide with the arrival of the annual [[wildebeest]] migration in the Mara, when the most predators gather to take advantage of abundant prey.\n\nEach series followed the daily lives of a [[lion]] pride, a [[cheetah]] family, and a [[leopard]] family. The crew, which can number up to 60 people,<ref name=\"WAus article\">{{cite news|url=http://www.thewest.com.au/default.aspx?MenuID=5&ContentID=77757 |title=Wild African cat-alogue |newspaper=The West Australian |date=2008-06-09 |accessdate=2008-08-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080831184644/http://www.thewest.com.au/default.aspx?MenuID=5 |archivedate=31 August 2008 }}</ref> used specially modified 4WD vehicles to travel around the Mara, tracking, spotting and filming the cats. The presenters also traveled in the vehicles, addressing the camera as the action unfolded in front of them. They use names and develop personalities for particular cats to draw the audience into a relationship with them. The similarity to [[soap opera]]s led to ''Big Cat Diary'' being called \"the original wildlife soap opera\".<ref name=\"WAus article\"/>\n\nOriginally intended to be a one-off series, ''Big Cat Diary'' proved so popular a further eight series plus occasional specials were broadcast. It spawned a number of other programs using the same wildlife diary format, including ''Elephant Diaries'' (2005\u20132008), ''Chimp Week'' (2006), ''Big Bear Week'' (2006), and ''Orangutan Diary'' (2007\u20132009). For the first few series, the episodes were broadcast weekly, but after 2004, they were shown on consecutive nights over the course of a single week. The 2004, 2005, and 2006 series were called ''Big Cat Week''. Since 2005, the ''Big Cat Diary'' website has carried additional video footage from the field and in 2006 a spin-off series called ''Big Cat Uncut'' was broadcast on [[BBC Three]] immediately after the [[BBC One]] episodes.\n\nOn 5 October 2008, the series returned to British television screens as ''Big Cat Live'', the BBC Natural History Unit's most ambitious live international broadcast. Host Kate Silverton and local [[Maasai people|Maasai]] guide Jackson Looseyia joined regular presenters King and Scott for two weeks of nightly live programmes on BBC One. Additional broadcast content included ''Little Big Cat'' on [[CBeebies]] and ''Big Cat Raw'', a webcast hosted on [[BBC Online]]. An update programme with highlights was shown at Christmas 2008.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/07_july/17/big_cat.shtml | title=Surprises, excitement and emotion await as Big Cat Live comes to BBC One, CBeebies, and bbc.co.uk.

The pride had a succession of male leaders: Scar and Scruffy (1998-2000), Simba and Blondie (2000-2004), Notch and Light Male (2004-2007), Clawed and Romeo (2007-2011). Three Graces are the daughters of Lion Notch and were born in 2005. The last filmed male leaders were known as the Four Musketeers: Scarface, Sikio, Morani, and Hunter.\n\nLionesses included White-Eye and the blonde sisters, Bibi and Lispy. There are also the Three Graces Joy, Charm and Beauty, three young females who had broken away from the main pride and formed a satellite group. In 2003, Bibi was kicked out of the pride and was featured on the first series of ''Big Cat Week'' as she struggled to raise her two cubs without the support of the pride. She was later accepted back into the main Marsh Pride.\n\n====The Ridge Pride====\nThis pride has only appeared in the more recent series. The main lions in this pride were Cheza and Sala, two young cubs growing up together despite having different parents. They were one of the main features of the 2004 series. As adults, they have since joined forces with another young lion from the Ridge Pride and taken over a nearby pride. Another former member of this pride was Solo, the only survivor of a litter of 3 or 4 cubs. He left his pride well before Cheza and Sala arrived. He teamed up with one of his older cousins to take over a pride. Solo was born in 2000 and was featured in the 3rd series of ''Big Cat Diary'' in 2000 and later in 4th series in 2002.\n\n====Tamu====\nThe focus of the 2006 series, Tamu was a lone lioness with four cubs fathered by Notch of the Marsh Pride. In Swahili, her name means \"the beautiful one.\" Tamu was a social outcast and had to hunt and raise her cubs alone. When a solitary rogue male invaded her den, she escaped with only two cubs, one of whom was injured and later died. Tamu found her remaining cubs after two days of searching. The audience watched as Tamu and the cubs investigated, licked, and acknowledged the death of their sibling. After a day, Tamu moved her young into the heart of Marsh territory to a den area most frequented by the rest of the pride. This put her in danger of the Marsh Pride lionesses who tried to oust Tamu and her cubs.\n\n====The Big Pride====\n\nBig Pride is also known as Acacia Pride or Gorge Pride. Filmed in 1996 as the first series of the show, they had a large number of lions\u201428--but were not filmed in following series.\n\n=== Cheetahs in the hostile world===\n\n====Kidogo====\nIn the first series in 1996, the show followed first-time mother Kidogo and her two 12-week-old cubs. While most cheetahs hunt during the day, Kidogo hunted late in the day. In one of ''Big Cat Diary'''s few episodes filmed at night, Kidogo and cubs come dangerously close to hunting lions.\n\n====Fundi ====\nFundi was also part of the first series. Fundi hunted regularly in thick [[acacia]] trees to keep her two adolescent cubs well-fed, unusual for cheetahs who usually hunt on open plains. Fundi means \"craftsman\" in Swahili.\n\n====Amber (sometimes known as Queen)====\nAmber was first seen in the second series in September 1998 as mother to three cubs of 16 months old. She used cars as vantage points to spot danger or prey. She was last seen and filmed in later October 2000 during the third series of the show.\n\n====Kimbia====\nKimbia was the territorial male cheetah of Amber's home range, filmed in the third ''Big Cat Diary'' in September\u2013October 2000.\n\n====Kike====\nAmber's daughter Kike (pronounced \"Kee-Kay\") returned in the first series of ''Big Cat Week'' in September 2003. Discovered at Rhino Ridge, Kike was mother to three cubs of nearly 9 months old. This was Kike's fourth litter, but she had not previously raised a cub to adulthood. Like her mother Amber, Kike used jeeps as vantage points to watch for danger or prey. The three cubs went on to appear in the 2004's ''Big Cat Week''. In an October 2008 webcast of ''Big Cat Raw'', [[Jonathan Scott (zoologist)|Jonathan Scott]] suggested Kike had not been spotted recently and had probably died. He confirmed her three cubs had survived and that her daughter Itchy had raised cubs of her own. Itchy was filmed in the first series of [[Planet Earth (2006 TV series)|Planet Earth]], and it is believed that another daughter of hers, named Serena, is mother of Malaika, the cheetah.\n\n====Honey and Toto====\nHoney was first featured on ''Big Cat Diary'' in 2002 as a capable first time mother of three tiny 8 week old cubs. For 2005's ''Big Cat Week'', viewers were introduced to her young cub, Toto, a [[Swahili language|Swahili]] word meaning \"the little one\". Honey was not mentioned on screen as Toto's mother because this was not known until after the series was filmed.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/programmes/tv/bcd/slideshows/cheetahs/honey.shtml BBC - Science & Nature - Big Cat Diary - Honey]</ref> When he was first filmed, it was estimated that Toto was only 6\u20138 weeks old, making him the youngest cheetah cub ever to be filmed on ''Big Cat Diary''. In the final episode of the series, Toto went missing overnight after a storm and was not found. It was reported a few days later that Honey was found living alone. The end credits that year consisted entirely of footage of Toto.\n\nHoney returned in the 2006 in the fourth series. When filming began, she had four cubs but one was soon lost in a lion attack. In February 2007, nearly a year before she last appeared on screen, Honey was killed after a vet accidentally shot her in the wrong place with a tranquilizer dart. The dart did not go into the muscle but hit her in the stomach near her kidneys.<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-511955/Honey-star-Big-Cat-Diary-killed-vets-blunder.html ''The Daily Mail'': Honey, star of Big Cat Diary, killed by vet's blunder]</ref> Her three remaining cubs, Snap (M-1), Crackle (M-2) and Pop (M-3), were cared for by the [[Mara Conservancy]].<ref>[http://paul-kirui.blogspot.com/2009/03/cheetahs-kill-zebra.html Paul Kirui Blog]</ref>\n\nIn October 2008, Honey's three now fully grown sons were filmed during ''Big Cat Live''. Crackle (M-2) was killed by lions in 2011 and just two years later in 2013, Pop (M-3) also became the victim of lions. Snap (M-1) was named as \"Mjuzi\" which means \"the last survivor\" in Swahili. He was last spotted in April 2013.\n\n====Shakira and Duma====\nIn 2005's ''Big Cat Week'', [[Jonathan Scott (zoologist)|Jonathan Scott]] (while following the story of Honey and Toto) introduced viewers to Duma and her mother (later named Shakira). She was also featured in ''Big Cat Diary: Family Histories.'' In ''Big Cat Live'' in 2008, Shakira was filmed with five 2-month-old cubs. They were attacked by some of the lions of Marsh pride and two eventually died during the series (possibly killed by [[hyena]]s).\n\n=== The leopards of Mara ===\n\n====Leopard Gorge====\n''Big Cat Diary'' only followed one leopard family through each generation. This family started with Half-Tail, a 9-year-old female in 1996, one of the most famous big cats who appeared on the show for quite a few years. She was named Half-Tail after a clash with baboons or lions in which she lost half her tail. This incident happened in 1993 when she was about 6 years old. She is the only leopard in the show who was not shown killing any large prey on screen. Half-Tail only ever managed to raise three cubs. Beauty (born in 1992) and Shadow (born in 1996) were her daughters and were both featured in the 1st series. She also raised a male cub called Mang'aa. Half-Tail had her sixth (final) litter of cubs in 1998 when she was nearly 11 years old but was killed when she attacked Maasai livestock. As her cubs were too young to feed themselves they died shortly afterwards. Shadow was to be the next leopard they followed and she went on to have a cub herself called Safi in 2000, who was rather shy of the cameras. Safi was born in January 2000. When the show returned in 2002, Shadow had a new litter of cubs. This was her 4th litter but, sadly, all of them died. In 2003 a new family was chosen, ending the line. Shadow was filmed briefly for ''Big Cat Week'', Series-3 in 2005 (broadcast in 2006); however the footage was not shown during that series. The footage would later air in a special documentary called ''The Big Story'' (10th anniversary celebration of ''Big Cat Diary'').\n\n====Bella====\nBella and her two cubs of 3 months old were found by presenter Saba Douglas-Hamilton in the 1st series of Big Cat Week in September,2003. Tiny Chui and his sister really provided a promising series. Months after filming ended, Chui's sister vanished. It later became clear she was dead, probably killed by lions. In 2005, the public and crew said goodbye to Chui and saw what should have been the final shots of them together, as he would leave Bella's side and protection sometime after filming. In October 2006, it was announced on their website that Chui had now been chased away by the resident male and Bella was now mating again. Chui has now been reported to have moved to a new territory downriver, where he was seen mating with a new female in Bella's adjacent territory. In Big Cat Live, viewers were introduced to Olive. Olive is Bella's daughter from 2000, before Chui was born. Olive has three cubs, one male, eight-month-old Kali, and two females, Ayah and Binti, independent from their mother. Bella, Olive, Ayah, Binti and Kali were nicknamed the \"Jackson Five\" after new presenter Jackson Looseyia, who was following their progress. The names Olive, Kali, Binti and Ayah were given to these leopards by Paul Kirui, veteran safari guide and a spotter for the leopard filming crew since 2006.  The \"Jackson Five\" is intriguing because three generations of these normally solitary cats are living together.\n\nOn 2 September 2009, Looseyia posted on his blog a picture of Olive carrying a cub in her mouth. She has a new litter of cubs. Looseyia stated it would appear to be two cubs. Kali has been chased away by Olive. Bella has since died.\n\nOlive was killed by lions in September 2013.\n\n[[Mara Conservancy]] has recently spotted Chui in Mara. He moved to Mara about 6 years ago and is 10 years old now.\n\n==International broadcasters==\n* Australia - [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], [[Ten Network]]\n* Bahrain - [[Bahrain Radio and Television Corporation|Bahrain 55]]\n* Belgium - [[E\u00e9n]]\n* Canada - [[Animal Planet (Canada)|Animal Planet]]\n* Estonia - [[Eesti Televisioon]]\n* France - [[France 5]]\n* Hong Kong - [[TVB Pearl]]\n* Japan - Animal Planet Japan\n* Mexico - [[Canal 40]]\n* Netherlands - [[Animal Planet]]\n* Portugal - [[Sociedade Independente de Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o|SIC]]\n* Russia - [[Animal Planet]], [[TV Kultura]]\n* South Africa - [[M-Net]]\n* Sweden - [[Animal Planet (Europe)|Animal Planet]]\n* Taiwan - [[Animal Planet]] (\u52d5\u7269\u661f\u7403\u983b\u9053)\n* Thailand - [[IBC2]]\n* Turkey - [[TRT 1]]\n* United States - [[Animal Planet]]\n* India - [[Animal Planet India|Animal Planet]]\n\n==Related series==\nThe BBC Natural History Unit has used the diary format popularised by ''Big Cat Diary'' for a number of related series. They include:\n\n===''Elephant Diaries''===\n''Elephant Diaries'' went behind the scenes at a sanctuary for orphaned [[African bush elephant]]s run by the [[David Sheldrick]] Wildlife Trust. [[Michaela Strachan]] and Jonathan Scott presented both series, which were broadcast in 2005 and 2008.\n\n===''Orangutan Diary''===\nTwo series of ''[[Orangutan Diary]]'' were aired; the first was shown in April 2007. It was filmed at the [[Borneo Orangutan Survival|Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation]] and showed the lives of rescued orangutans. A second series was shown in 2009, consisting of six one-hour shows. Both series were presented by Michaela Strachan and [[Steve Leonard]].\n\n===''Big Bear Week''===\nPresenters followed the three species of bear native to North America for this one-off series. Jonathan Scott followed [[brown bear]]s in [[Alaska]], Saba Douglas-Hamilton observed [[polar bears]] in [[Churchill, Manitoba]] and Jeff Turner tracked [[American black bear]]s in [[British Columbia]]. They were all situated in different parts of Canada. ''Big Bear Week'' was broadcast in the summer of 2006 on BBC One, soon after the third series of ''Big Cat Week''.\n\n===''Chimp Week''===\nFilmed over eight years, ''Chimp Week'' followed the lives of two family groups of [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s in [[Gombe Stream National Park]] in [[Tanzania]]. It was narrated by Jonathan Scott and broadcast in January 2006.\n\n==Merchandise==\n\nCurrently available on [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]] DVD are the 2004, 2005 and 2006 series of ''Big Cat Week'' (packaged as series 1 to 3, with series 1 and 2 being packaged together), the 2007 series of ''Big Cat Diary'' (packaged as series 4 of ''Big Cat Week'') and highlights from ''Big Cat Live'' (packaged as ''Big Cat Special''). There is also a trilogy of books written by Jonathan and Angela Scott, with each focusing on the stories concerning the lions, cheetahs and leopards of the 'Big Cat Diary' format of the show.\n\nIn 2012, Seasons 1 and 2 of the original ''Big Cat Diary'' show was made available to download on iTunes and Amazon's Instant Video services. These episodes are DVD quality or better, however no DVD or any other physical media are available for these two seasons.

The first series, broadcast on [[BBC One]] in 1996, was developed and jointly produced by [[Keith Scholey]], who would go on to become Head of the BBC's [[BBC Natural History Unit|Natural History Unit]].<ref>{{cite magazine | url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/terrestrial/2008/04/bbc_factual_boss_quits.html | title=BBC factual boss quits |magazine=Broadcast Now |date=2008-04-21 |accessdate=2008-08-31}}</ref> Eight series have followed, most recently ''Big Cat Live'', a live broadcast from the Mara in 2008.\n\nThe original presenters, [[Jonathan Scott (zoologist)|Jonathan Scott]] and [[Simon King (television)|Simon King]], were joined by [[Saba Douglas-Hamilton]] from 2002 onwards. [[Kate Silverton]] and [[Jackson Looseyia]] were added to the presenting team for ''Big Cat Live''.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Background==\n\nThe [[BBC Natural History Unit]] originally wanted to film in the [[Serengeti National Park]] in [[Tanzania]], but when this proved too expensive, they switched to Kenya.{{citation needed|date=January 2009}} Filming was timed to coincide with the arrival of the annual [[wildebeest]] migration in the Mara, when the most predators gather to take advantage of abundant prey.\n\nEach series followed the daily lives of a [[lion]] pride, a [[cheetah]] family, and a [[leopard]] family. The crew, which can number up to 60 people,<ref name=\"WAus article\">{{cite news|url=http://www.thewest.com.au/default.aspx?MenuID=5&ContentID=77757 |title=Wild African cat-alogue |newspaper=The West Australian |date=2008-06-09 |accessdate=2008-08-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080831184644/http://www.thewest.com.au/default.aspx?MenuID=5 |archivedate=31 August 2008 }}</ref> used specially modified 4WD vehicles to travel around the Mara, tracking, spotting and filming the cats. The presenters also traveled in the vehicles, addressing the camera as the action unfolded in front of them. They use names and develop personalities for particular cats to draw the audience into a relationship with them. The similarity to [[soap opera]]s led to ''Big Cat Diary'' being called \"the original wildlife soap opera\".<ref name=\"WAus article\"/>\n\nOriginally intended to be a one-off series, ''Big Cat Diary'' proved so popular a further eight series plus occasional specials were broadcast. It spawned a number of other programs using the same wildlife diary format, including ''Elephant Diaries'' (2005\u20132008), ''Chimp Week'' (2006), ''Big Bear Week'' (2006), and ''Orangutan Diary'' (2007\u20132009). For the first few series, the episodes were broadcast weekly, but after 2004, they were shown on consecutive nights over the course of a single week. The 2004, 2005, and 2006 series were called ''Big Cat Week''. Since 2005, the ''Big Cat Diary'' website has carried additional video footage from the field and in 2006 a spin-off series called ''Big Cat Uncut'' was broadcast on [[BBC Three]] immediately after the [[BBC One]] episodes.\n\nOn 5 October 2008, the series returned to British television screens as ''Big Cat Live'', the BBC Natural History Unit's most ambitious live international broadcast. Host Kate Silverton and local [[Maasai people|Maasai]] guide Jackson Looseyia joined regular presenters King and Scott for two weeks of nightly live programmes on BBC One. Additional broadcast content included ''Little Big Cat'' on [[CBeebies]] and ''Big Cat Raw'', a webcast hosted on [[BBC Online]]. An update programme with highlights was shown at Christmas 2008.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/07_july/17/big_cat.shtml | title=Surprises, excitement and emotion await as Big Cat Live comes to BBC One, CBeebies, and bbc.co.uk.

The pride had a succession of male leaders: Scar and Scruffy (1998-2000), Simba and Blondie (2000-2004), Notch and Light Male (2004-2007), Clawed and Romeo (2007-2011). Three Graces are the daughters of Lion Notch and were born in 2005. The last filmed male leaders were known as the Four Musketeers: Scarface, Sikio, Morani, and Hunter.\n\nLionesses included White-Eye and the blonde sisters, Bibi and Lispy. There are also the Three Graces Joy, Charm and Beauty, three young females who had broken away from the main pride and formed a satellite group. In 2003, Bibi was kicked out of the pride and was featured on the first series of ''Big Cat Week'' as she struggled to raise her two cubs without the support of the pride. She was later accepted back into the main Marsh Pride.\n\n====The Ridge Pride====\nThis pride has only appeared in the more recent series. The main lions in this pride were Cheza and Sala, two young cubs growing up together despite having different parents. They were one of the main features of the 2004 series. As adults, they have since joined forces with another young lion from the Ridge Pride and taken over a nearby pride. Another former member of this pride was Solo, the only survivor of a litter of 3 or 4 cubs. He left his pride well before Cheza and Sala arrived. He teamed up with one of his older cousins to take over a pride. Solo was born in 2000 and was featured in the 3rd series of ''Big Cat Diary'' in 2000 and later in 4th series in 2002.\n\n====Tamu====\nThe focus of the 2006 series, Tamu was a lone lioness with four cubs fathered by Notch of the Marsh Pride. In Swahili, her name means \"the beautiful one.\" Tamu was a social outcast and had to hunt and raise her cubs alone. When a solitary rogue male invaded her den, she escaped with only two cubs, one of whom was injured and later died. Tamu found her remaining cubs after two days of searching. The audience watched as Tamu and the cubs investigated, licked, and acknowledged the death of their sibling. After a day, Tamu moved her young into the heart of Marsh territory to a den area most frequented by the rest of the pride. This put her in danger of the Marsh Pride lionesses who tried to oust Tamu and her cubs.\n\n====The Big Pride====\n\nBig Pride is also known as Acacia Pride or Gorge Pride. Filmed in 1996 as the first series of the show, they had a large number of lions\u201428--but were not filmed in following series.\n\n=== Cheetahs in the hostile world===\n\n====Kidogo====\nIn the first series in 1996, the show followed first-time mother Kidogo and her two 12-week-old cubs. While most cheetahs hunt during the day, Kidogo hunted late in the day. In one of ''Big Cat Diary'''s few episodes filmed at night, Kidogo and cubs come dangerously close to hunting lions.\n\n====Fundi ====\nFundi was also part of the first series. Fundi hunted regularly in thick [[acacia]] trees to keep her two adolescent cubs well-fed, unusual for cheetahs who usually hunt on open plains. Fundi means \"craftsman\" in Swahili.\n\n====Amber (sometimes known as Queen)====\nAmber was first seen in the second series in September 1998 as mother to three cubs of 16 months old. She used cars as vantage points to spot danger or prey. She was last seen and filmed in later October 2000 during the third series of the show.\n\n====Kimbia====\nKimbia was the territorial male cheetah of Amber's home range, filmed in the third ''Big Cat Diary'' in September\u2013October 2000.\n\n====Kike====\nAmber's daughter Kike (pronounced \"Kee-Kay\") returned in the first series of ''Big Cat Week'' in September 2003. Discovered at Rhino Ridge, Kike was mother to three cubs of nearly 9 months old. This was Kike's fourth litter, but she had not previously raised a cub to adulthood. Like her mother Amber, Kike used jeeps as vantage points to watch for danger or prey. The three cubs went on to appear in the 2004's ''Big Cat Week''. In an October 2008 webcast of ''Big Cat Raw'', [[Jonathan Scott (zoologist)|Jonathan Scott]] suggested Kike had not been spotted recently and had probably died. He confirmed her three cubs had survived and that her daughter Itchy had raised cubs of her own. Itchy was filmed in the first series of [[Planet Earth (2006 TV series)|Planet Earth]], and it is believed that another daughter of hers, named Serena, is mother of Malaika, the cheetah.\n\n====Honey and Toto====\nHoney was first featured on ''Big Cat Diary'' in 2002 as a capable first time mother of three tiny 8 week old cubs. For 2005's ''Big Cat Week'', viewers were introduced to her young cub, Toto, a [[Swahili language|Swahili]] word meaning \"the little one\". Honey was not mentioned on screen as Toto's mother because this was not known until after the series was filmed.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/programmes/tv/bcd/slideshows/cheetahs/honey.shtml BBC - Science & Nature - Big Cat Diary - Honey]</ref> When he was first filmed, it was estimated that Toto was only 6\u20138 weeks old, making him the youngest cheetah cub ever to be filmed on ''Big Cat Diary''. In the final episode of the series, Toto went missing overnight after a storm and was not found. It was reported a few days later that Honey was found living alone. The end credits that year consisted entirely of footage of Toto.\n\nHoney returned in the 2006 in the fourth series. When filming began, she had four cubs but one was soon lost in a lion attack. In February 2007, nearly a year before she last appeared on screen, Honey was killed after a vet accidentally shot her in the wrong place with a tranquilizer dart. The dart did not go into the muscle but hit her in the stomach near her kidneys.<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-511955/Honey-star-Big-Cat-Diary-killed-vets-blunder.html ''The Daily Mail'': Honey, star of Big Cat Diary, killed by vet's blunder]</ref> Her three remaining cubs, Snap (M-1), Crackle (M-2) and Pop (M-3), were cared for by the [[Mara Conservancy]].<ref>[http://paul-kirui.blogspot.com/2009/03/cheetahs-kill-zebra.html Paul Kirui Blog]</ref>\n\nIn October 2008, Honey's three now fully grown sons were filmed during ''Big Cat Live''. Crackle (M-2) was killed by lions in 2011 and just two years later in 2013, Pop (M-3) also became the victim of lions. Snap (M-1) was named as \"Mjuzi\" which means \"the last survivor\" in Swahili. He was last spotted in April 2013.\n\n====Shakira and Duma====\nIn 2005's ''Big Cat Week'', [[Jonathan Scott (zoologist)|Jonathan Scott]] (while following the story of Honey and Toto) introduced viewers to Duma and her mother (later named Shakira). She was also featured in ''Big Cat Diary: Family Histories.'' In ''Big Cat Live'' in 2008, Shakira was filmed with five 2-month-old cubs. They were attacked by some of the lions of Marsh pride and two eventually died during the series (possibly killed by [[hyena]]s).\n\n=== The leopards of Mara ===\n\n====Leopard Gorge====\n''Big Cat Diary'' only followed one leopard family through each generation. This family started with Half-Tail, a 9-year-old female in 1996, one of the most famous big cats who appeared on the show for quite a few years. She was named Half-Tail after a clash with baboons or lions in which she lost half her tail. This incident happened in 1993 when she was about 6 years old. She is the only leopard in the show who was not shown killing any large prey on screen. Half-Tail only ever managed to raise three cubs. Beauty (born in 1992) and Shadow (born in 1996) were her daughters and were both featured in the 1st series. She also raised a male cub called Mang'aa. Half-Tail had her sixth (final) litter of cubs in 1998 when she was nearly 11 years old but was killed when she attacked Maasai livestock. As her cubs were too young to feed themselves they died shortly afterwards. Shadow was to be the next leopard they followed and she went on to have a cub herself called Safi in 2000, who was rather shy of the cameras. Safi was born in January 2000. When the show returned in 2002, Shadow had a new litter of cubs. This was her 4th litter but, sadly, all of them died. In 2003 a new family was chosen, ending the line. Shadow was filmed briefly for ''Big Cat Week'', Series-3 in 2005 (broadcast in 2006); however the footage was not shown during that series. The footage would later air in a special documentary called ''The Big Story'' (10th anniversary celebration of ''Big Cat Diary'').\n\n====Bella====\nBella and her two cubs of 3 months old were found by presenter Saba Douglas-Hamilton in the 1st series of Big Cat Week in September,2003. Tiny Chui and his sister really provided a promising series. Months after filming ended, Chui's sister vanished. It later became clear she was dead, probably killed by lions. In 2005, the public and crew said goodbye to Chui and saw what should have been the final shots of them together, as he would leave Bella's side and protection sometime after filming. In October 2006, it was announced on their website that Chui had now been chased away by the resident male and Bella was now mating again. Chui has now been reported to have moved to a new territory downriver, where he was seen mating with a new female in Bella's adjacent territory. In Big Cat Live, viewers were introduced to Olive. Olive is Bella's daughter from 2000, before Chui was born. Olive has three cubs, one male, eight-month-old Kali, and two females, Ayah and Binti, independent from their mother. Bella, Olive, Ayah, Binti and Kali were nicknamed the \"Jackson Five\" after new presenter Jackson Looseyia, who was following their progress. The names Olive, Kali, Binti and Ayah were given to these leopards by Paul Kirui, veteran safari guide and a spotter for the leopard filming crew since 2006.  The \"Jackson Five\" is intriguing because three generations of these normally solitary cats are living together.\n\nOn 2 September 2009, Looseyia posted on his blog a picture of Olive carrying a cub in her mouth. She has a new litter of cubs. Looseyia stated it would appear to be two cubs. Kali has been chased away by Olive. Bella has since died.\n\nOlive was killed by lions in September 2013.\n\n[[Mara Conservancy]] has recently spotted Chui in Mara. He moved to Mara about 6 years ago and is 10 years old now.\n\n==Related series==\nThe BBC Natural History Unit has used the diary format popularised by ''Big Cat Diary'' for a number of related series. They include:\n\n===''Elephant Diaries''===\n''Elephant Diaries'' went behind the scenes at a sanctuary for orphaned [[African bush elephant]]s run by the [[David Sheldrick]] Wildlife Trust. [[Michaela Strachan]] and Jonathan Scott presented both series, which were broadcast in 2005 and 2008.\n\n===''Orangutan Diary''===\nTwo series of ''[[Orangutan Diary]]'' were aired; the first was shown in April 2007. It was filmed at the [[Borneo Orangutan Survival|Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation]] and showed the lives of rescued orangutans. A second series was shown in 2009, consisting of six one-hour shows. Both series were presented by Michaela Strachan and [[Steve Leonard]].\n\n===''Big Bear Week''===\nPresenters followed the three species of bear native to North America for this one-off series. Jonathan Scott followed [[brown bear]]s in [[Alaska]], Saba Douglas-Hamilton observed [[polar bears]] in [[Churchill, Manitoba]] and Jeff Turner tracked [[American black bear]]s in [[British Columbia]]. They were all situated in different parts of Canada. ''Big Bear Week'' was broadcast in the summer of 2006 on BBC One, soon after the third series of ''Big Cat Week''.\n\n===''Chimp Week''===\nFilmed over eight years, ''Chimp Week'' followed the lives of two family groups of [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s in [[Gombe Stream National Park]] in [[Tanzania]]. It was narrated by Jonathan Scott and broadcast in January 2006.\n\n==Merchandise==\n\nCurrently available on [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]] DVD are the 2004, 2005 and 2006 series of ''Big Cat Week'' (packaged as series 1 to 3, with series 1 and 2 being packaged together), the 2007 series of ''Big Cat Diary'' (packaged as series 4 of ''Big Cat Week'') and highlights from ''Big Cat Live'' (packaged as ''Big Cat Special''). There is also a trilogy of books written by Jonathan and Angela Scott, with each focusing on the stories concerning the lions, cheetahs and leopards of the 'Big Cat Diary' format of the show.\n\nIn 2012, Seasons 1 and 2 of the original ''Big Cat Diary'' show was made available to download on iTunes and Amazon's Instant Video services. These episodes are DVD quality or better, however no DVD or any other physical media are available for these two seasons. Additionally, Seasons 3 and 4 of the original Big Cat Diary series are not available at all as of August 2012.\n\nThe name and format of the show has changed several times.

{"title_page": "Dr Otter", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2012}}\n'''Dr Otter''' is a stop-motion animated series created & written by David Bonner and produced by Ealing Animation and [[Cosgrove Hall Films]].\nIt was shown on [[CBBC]] during 2001. There were 3 seasons in all.\n\n== Plot ==\n\nDr Melvyn P Otter is the GP for a small group of animals. He lives in a delightful riverside house with his wife, Raylee and his faithful assistant, Flybread (a cat). Each episode, Dr Otter is called upon to tend his little catchment area, which include Mrs Canny Body, Dunston the mole and the Rabbit family, as well as a newt called Lucky.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n* '''Dr Otter''' - is voiced by [[Rob Rackstraw]], who  also voices the naughty scarecrow Spud, in \"Bob the Builder\". He is rather a dapper otter, who always manages to unravel any difficult situations, usually caused by the inexperience of Flybread. He is a kindly soul, trusted by the tiny community.\n* '''Raylee''' - is his wife, she offers assistance in all the episodes. She is very level headed and calm.\n* '''Flybread''' - Dr Otter's assistant, has a tendency to arrogance, but he is really somewhat inexperienced and gets himself into amusing little situations, always to be rescued by Dr Otter or Raylee. He has a very \"posh\" accent.\n* '''Mrs Canny Body''' (voiced by [[Jan Francis]]) - is a delightful old lady who loves to bake cakes for everyone in the community. There is only one problem, they are as hard as concrete and everyone hates them! In at least one episode the cake is used for a completely different purpose to that which was intended.

There were 3 seasons in all.\n\n== Plot ==\n\nDr Melvyn P Otter is the GP for a small group of animals. He lives in a delightful riverside house with his wife, Raylee and his faithful assistant, Flybread (a cat). Each episode, Dr Otter is called upon to tend his little catchment area, which include Mrs Canny Body, Dunston the mole and the Rabbit family, as well as a newt called Lucky.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n* '''Dr Otter''' - is voiced by [[Rob Rackstraw]], who  also voices the naughty scarecrow Spud, in \"Bob the Builder\". He is rather a dapper otter, who always manages to unravel any difficult situations, usually caused by the inexperience of Flybread. He is a kindly soul, trusted by the tiny community.\n* '''Raylee''' - is his wife, she offers assistance in all the episodes. She is very level headed and calm.\n* '''Flybread''' - Dr Otter's assistant, has a tendency to arrogance, but he is really somewhat inexperienced and gets himself into amusing little situations, always to be rescued by Dr Otter or Raylee. He has a very \"posh\" accent.\n* '''Mrs Canny Body''' (voiced by [[Jan Francis]]) - is a delightful old lady who loves to bake cakes for everyone in the community. There is only one problem, they are as hard as concrete and everyone hates them! In at least one episode the cake is used for a completely different purpose to that which was intended. (for instance, a spare tyre!)\n* '''Dunston''' - is a very old and blind mole who lives alone and finds it hard to manage. He gets very confused, and wears an old holey jumper. He needs help in quite a few of the episodes.\n* '''The Rabbit family''' - consist of dad Dexley and mum Dandelion.

Gibbon Jr.]], who had been the executive producer of the original ''[[The Electric Company]]'' for CTW from 1971 to 1977. (Gibbon had left CTW before ''Contact'''s production officially began, though he was still credited as \"Senior Consultant\".) The show was based on the original concept of ''[[The Curiosity Show]]'', an Australian science-based children's educational TV show that had been running since 1972. That program was hosted by Australian scientists [[Rob Morrison (scientist)|Rob Morrison]] and [[Deane Hutton]], who were consultants to The Children's Television Workshop in the early planning stages of what became ''3-2-1 Contact''. CTW wanted to make a version using American scientists as presenters, but PBS did not think that middle-aged scientists would engage a young audience (despite the popularity of the format in Australia) and insisted that any science show be hosted/presented by young people. CTW eventually reworked the concept into ''3-2-1 Contact''.\n\n===Seasons production===\nThe first season of 65 programs began airing January 14, 1980, on select [[List of PBS member stations|PBS member stations]]; it featured a cast of three college students who socialized and discussed science in an on-campus room known as \"the workshop\". This season came to an end on April 11, 1980, and continued in reruns (or removed entirely from scheduling on some stations) for the following three years, as funding for additional episodes was not yet sufficient.\n\nWhen production finally resumed for the second season, which premiered on October 17, 1983, the show presented a more realistic appearance, as the new cast convened in a suburban basement (these segments were shot at [[Teletape Studios|Reeves Teletape]], which also housed ''[[Sesame Street]]'' at the time). This cast continued until October 18, 1985. [[Ozzie Alfonso]] was ''Contact''{{'}}s new director and [[Al Hyslop]] its executive producer.\n\nWhen the fifth season began on September 22, 1986, a third cast was introduced. However, unlike the previous casts, they did not meet in any specific setting; instead, they appeared in various taped and filmed segments. The show ended after seven seasons and 225 episodes on November 18, 1988.\n\n===International and school versions===\n\nFor a time in the mid-1980s, the program was co-produced with the French [[television network]] [[France 3|FR3]] and featured several new French cast members in addition to the [[United States|American]] cast. From 1982 to 1983 the program was aired in Spain with dubbed-over versions of the American original broadcasts, and some local add-ons with four Spanish cast members: [[Sonia Mart\u00ednez]], Luis Bollain, Fernando Rueda, and Marif\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez.<ref>[[La Vanguardia]], February 12, 1982, April 4, 1983.</ref> Another Spanish version of the broadcast was aired from 1990 to 1992.\n\nIt was reported in 1984 that ''3-2-1 Contact'' had an audience of over 7&nbsp;million viewers and was broadcast in 26 countries including [[West Germany]], France, [[Italy]], and Spain making their own dubbed-over versions.<ref name=NYTimes/>\n\nFrom September 1, 1991 to May 1, 1992, an edited version titled '''''3-2-1 Classroom Contact''''' was produced, specifically for in-school viewing. It was hosted by either Stephanie Yu, Z. Wright, or both and used previously aired segments from the past series.\n\nBroadcasters wanted children and schools to record and replay the episodes without being afraid of infringement of copyright violations.<ref name=NYTimes/>\n\n==Hosts==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Liz Moses]] as Lisa (1980)\n* [[Leon W.

Occasionally, shows were also rerun on Nickelodeon's Cable in the Classroom time period. For all these Nickelodeon and Noggin airings, the series was rated TV-Y7 (possibly due to the target audience). It also still aired on some PBS stations as reruns from 1989 to 1998 before it was switched to Noggin in 1999. In 2003, Sesame Workshop sold its half of Noggin to [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]] (which already owned the other half). The shows were modified for the shorter running time on these networks to allow for their [[Interstitial program|interstitials]].  It is unknown if the series will be released on DVD.\n\n==International Broadcast==\n* {{flagicon|USA}} United States\n** [[PBS]]\n* {{flagicon|UAE}} United Arab Emirates\n** [[Dubai 33]]\n* {{flagicon|Australia}} Australia\n** [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC TV]]\n* {{flagicon|Guam}} Guam\n** [[KGTF]]\n* {{flagicon|Canada}} Canada\n** [[Knowledge Network]]\n* {{flagicon|Kuwait}} Kuwait\n** [[KTV2]]\n* {{flagicon|Ireland}} Ireland\n** [[RT\u00c9 One]]\n** [[Network 2]]\n* {{flagicon|Singapore}} Singapore\n** [[Mediacorp Channel 5]]\n* {{flagicon|Saudi Arabia}} Saudi Arabia\n** [[Saudi 2]]\n* {{flagicon|Hong Kong}} Hong Kong\n** [[TVB Pearl]]\n* {{flagicon|Nigeria}} Nigeria\n** [[Nigerian Television Authority|NTA]]\n* {{flagicon|Jamaica}} Jamaica\n** [[Jamaica Broadcasting Corporation|JBC]]\n* {{flagicon|Malaysia}} Malaysia\n** [[TV2 (Malaysia)|TV2]]\n* {{flagicon|UK}} United Kingdom\n** [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]\n* {{flagicon|Germany}} Germany\n** [[Armed Forces Network]]\n* {{flagicon|Brunei}} Brunei\n** [[Radio Television Brunei|RTB]]\n* {{flagicon|Israel}} Israel\n** [[Channel 1 (Israel)|Channel 1]]\n** [[Arutz HaYeladim|The Kids' Channel]]\n* {{flagicon|Korea}} Korea\n** [[American Forces Network|American Forces Korea Network]]\n* {{flagicon|New Zealand}} New Zealand\n** [[TVNZ 1]]\n\n==The Bloodhound Gang==\n{{main|The Bloodhound Gang (TV series)}}\nA frequent segment of the show was [[The Bloodhound Gang (TV series)|''The Bloodhound Gang'']], a series about a group of young detectives who used science to solve crimes. Episodes of the series needed to be run in regular sequence for understandable viewing, as many ''Bloodhound Gang'' mysteries were cut among two or three ''Contact'' episodes.\n\n==Magazine==\nThree months before the show premiered, a print magazine of the same name that also focused on science was released. In 1985, the magazine absorbed some of the content of sibling publication [[Enter (magazine)|''Enter'']] (which went out of print that same year), including reader submissions of computer programs written in the [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]] [[computer language]] as well as reviews of popular computer programs.  The ''Enter'' section also contained a new feature called \"The Slipped Disk Show,\" in which a fictional disc jockey answered computer-related questions submitted by readers.\n\nIn 1987, the magazine began featuring content from another CTW production, ''[[Square One Television]]''. Such content frequently took the form of a two-page comic strip, often parodying a popular show or movie of the time, with a math-related question at the end.\n\nThe ''Bloodhound Gang'' mysteries also made the leap to the magazine, but they were subsequently replaced with a series entitled '''''The Time Team''''' in September 1990. These stories found teenage characters Sean Nolan and Jenny Lopez traveling to different time periods in the past and future. Their surroundings and personal encounters were described with great detail, educating readers as to the customs of various cultures throughout history, and \u2013 on trips to the future \u2013 often pushing present day hot-button issues. For example, a 1993 story saw the duo traveling to what appeared to be a prehistoric forest, but near the end, they found a [[Brazil]] flag, a newspaper clipping from 1995, and a bulldozer at work: this was in fact a Brazilian [[rainforest]] being levelled.\n\nIn 1996, ''The Time Team'' was replaced by a comic serial, '''''Cosmic Crew''''', which focused on the adventures of a group of teenagers and their robot butler in space. Their first story arc (which ran for more than a year) had them trying to figure out a series of riddles relating to places in the solar system in order to claim a treasure (which turned out to be a scholarship fund). Another story arc had a delinquent (who had been a villain in the first arc) join them in order to chase down a gang of other delinquents. Despite being effectively replaced, a few ''Time Team'' stories were run whenever there were gaps between installments of ''Cosmic Crew''.\n\nMany of the magazine's cover stories involved current events, such as 1990s oil fires in the [[Middle East]]. In addition, the magazine offered a games section in which most of the games were related to the stories in the issue.\n\nIn 1996, CTW presumably concluded that faithful readers from the late 1980s and early 1990s had long since moved on, and the magazine began to reprint non-time-sensitive stories from years past. For example, a 1991 article on the geography of the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands]] \u2013 a subject relatively unchanging due to the islands' well-enforced ecologically protected status \u2013 could very well re-appear in an identical format a half a decade later.\n\nUnder Children's Television Workshop (now known as [[Sesame Workshop]]), the magazine later became ''Contact Kids'', removing the original reference to the television show. Production of the magazine was suspended indefinitely in 2001.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|url=http://www.sesameworkshop.org/archive/3-2-1-contact/}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0190169|title=3-2-1 Contact}}\n* {{tv.com show|3-2-1-contact|3-2-1 Contact}}\n* ''[https://www.facebook.com/321contact1980/ 3-2-1 Contact]''  fan site on Facebook\n\n{{Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Children's Program}}\n{{PBSKids shows}}\n\n[[Category:1980 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1988 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:1980s American children's television series]]\n[[Category:1980s American science fiction television series]]\n[[Category:American children's magazines]]\n[[Category:PBS original programming]]\n[[Category:Science education television series]]\n[[Category:Television series by Sesame Workshop]]\n[[Category:Television shows filmed in New York (state)]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television\n| show_name = 3-2-1 Contact\n| image = 321 Contact2.png\n| caption = Original opening title of ''3-2-1 Contact''\n| runtime = 30 minutes\n| creator = [[Samuel Y.

Gibbon Jr.]], who had been the executive producer of the original ''[[The Electric Company]]'' for CTW from 1971 to 1977. (Gibbon had left CTW before ''Contact'''s production officially began, though he was still credited as \"Senior Consultant\".) The show was based on the original concept of ''[[The Curiosity Show]]'', an Australian science-based children's educational TV show that had been running since 1972. That program was hosted by Australian scientists [[Rob Morrison (scientist)|Rob Morrison]] and [[Deane Hutton]], who were consultants to The Children's Television Workshop in the early planning stages of what became ''3-2-1 Contact''. CTW wanted to make a version using American scientists as presenters, but PBS did not think that middle-aged scientists would engage a young audience (despite the popularity of the format in Australia) and insisted that any science show be hosted/presented by young people. CTW eventually reworked the concept into ''3-2-1 Contact''.\n\n===Seasons production===\nThe first season of 65 programs began airing January 14, 1980, on select [[List of PBS member stations|PBS member stations]]; it featured a cast of three college students who socialized and discussed science in an on-campus room known as \"the workshop\". This season came to an end on April 11, 1980, and continued in reruns (or removed entirely from scheduling on some stations) for the following three years, as funding for additional episodes was not yet sufficient.\n\nWhen production finally resumed for the second season, which premiered on October 17, 1983, the show presented a more realistic appearance, as the new cast convened in a suburban basement (these segments were shot at [[Teletape Studios|Reeves Teletape]], which also housed ''[[Sesame Street]]'' at the time). This cast continued until October 18, 1985. [[Ozzie Alfonso]] was ''Contact''{{'}}s new director and [[Al Hyslop]] its executive producer.\n\nWhen the fifth season began on September 22, 1986, a third cast was introduced. However, unlike the previous casts, they did not meet in any specific setting; instead, they appeared in various taped and filmed segments. The show ended after seven seasons and 225 episodes on November 18, 1988.\n\n===International and school versions===\n\nFor a time in the mid-1980s, the program was co-produced with the French [[television network]] [[France 3|FR3]] and featured several new French cast members in addition to the [[United States|American]] cast. From 1982 to 1983 the program was aired in Spain with dubbed-over versions of the American original broadcasts, and some local add-ons with four Spanish cast members: [[Sonia Mart\u00ednez]], Luis Bollain, Fernando Rueda, and Marif\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez.<ref>[[La Vanguardia]], February 12, 1982, April 4, 1983.</ref> Another Spanish version of the broadcast was aired from 1990 to 1992.\n\nIt was reported in 1984 that ''3-2-1 Contact'' had an audience of over 7&nbsp;million viewers and was broadcast in 26 countries including [[West Germany]], France, [[Italy]], and Spain making their own dubbed-over versions.<ref name=NYTimes/>\n\nFrom September 1, 1991 to May 1, 1992, an edited version titled '''''3-2-1 Classroom Contact''''' was produced, specifically for in-school viewing. It was hosted by either Stephanie Yu, Z. Wright, or both and used previously aired segments from the past series.\n\nBroadcasters wanted children and schools to record and replay the episodes without being afraid of infringement of copyright violations.<ref name=NYTimes/>\n\n==Hosts==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Liz Moses]] as Lisa (1980)\n* [[Leon W.

Occasionally, shows were also rerun on Nickelodeon's Cable in the Classroom time period. For all these Nickelodeon and Noggin airings, the series was rated TV-Y7 (possibly due to the target audience). It also still aired on some PBS stations as reruns from 1989 to 1998 before it was switched to Noggin in 1999. In 2003, Sesame Workshop sold its half of Noggin to [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]] (which already owned the other half). The shows were modified for the shorter running time on these networks to allow for their [[Interstitial program|interstitials]].  It is unknown if the series will be released on DVD.\n\n==The Bloodhound Gang==\n{{main|The Bloodhound Gang (TV series)}}\nA frequent segment of the show was [[The Bloodhound Gang (TV series)|''The Bloodhound Gang'']], a series about a group of young detectives who used science to solve crimes. Episodes of the series needed to be run in regular sequence for understandable viewing, as many ''Bloodhound Gang'' mysteries were cut among two or three ''Contact'' episodes.\n\n==Magazine==\nThree months before the show premiered, a print magazine of the same name that also focused on science was released. In 1985, the magazine absorbed some of the content of sibling publication [[Enter (magazine)|''Enter'']] (which went out of print that same year), including reader submissions of computer programs written in the [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]] [[computer language]] as well as reviews of popular computer programs.  The ''Enter'' section also contained a new feature called \"The Slipped Disk Show,\" in which a fictional disc jockey answered computer-related questions submitted by readers.\n\nIn 1987, the magazine began featuring content from another CTW production, ''[[Square One Television]]''. Such content frequently took the form of a two-page comic strip, often parodying a popular show or movie of the time, with a math-related question at the end.\n\nThe ''Bloodhound Gang'' mysteries also made the leap to the magazine, but they were subsequently replaced with a series entitled '''''The Time Team''''' in September 1990. These stories found teenage characters Sean Nolan and Jenny Lopez traveling to different time periods in the past and future. Their surroundings and personal encounters were described with great detail, educating readers as to the customs of various cultures throughout history, and \u2013 on trips to the future \u2013 often pushing present day hot-button issues. For example, a 1993 story saw the duo traveling to what appeared to be a prehistoric forest, but near the end, they found a [[Brazil]] flag, a newspaper clipping from 1995, and a bulldozer at work: this was in fact a Brazilian [[rainforest]] being levelled.\n\nIn 1996, ''The Time Team'' was replaced by a comic serial, '''''Cosmic Crew''''', which focused on the adventures of a group of teenagers and their robot butler in space. Their first story arc (which ran for more than a year) had them trying to figure out a series of riddles relating to places in the solar system in order to claim a treasure (which turned out to be a scholarship fund). Another story arc had a delinquent (who had been a villain in the first arc) join them in order to chase down a gang of other delinquents. Despite being effectively replaced, a few ''Time Team'' stories were run whenever there were gaps between installments of ''Cosmic Crew''.\n\nMany of the magazine's cover stories involved current events, such as 1990s oil fires in the [[Middle East]]. In addition, the magazine offered a games section in which most of the games were related to the stories in the issue.\n\nIn 1996, CTW presumably concluded that faithful readers from the late 1980s and early 1990s had long since moved on, and the magazine began to reprint non-time-sensitive stories from years past. For example, a 1991 article on the geography of the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands]] \u2013 a subject relatively unchanging due to the islands' well-enforced ecologically protected status \u2013 could very well re-appear in an identical format a half a decade later.\n\nUnder Children's Television Workshop (now known as [[Sesame Workshop]]), the magazine later became ''Contact Kids'', removing the original reference to the television show. Production of the magazine was suspended indefinitely in 2001.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|url=http://www.sesameworkshop.org/archive/3-2-1-contact/}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0190169|title=3-2-1 Contact}}\n* {{tv.com show|3-2-1-contact|3-2-1 Contact}}\n* ''[https://www.facebook.com/321contact1980/ 3-2-1 Contact]''  fan site on Facebook\n\n{{Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Children's Program}}\n{{PBSKids shows}}\n\n[[Category:1980 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1988 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:1980s American children's television series]]\n[[Category:1980s American science fiction television series]]\n[[Category:American children's magazines]]\n[[Category:PBS original programming]]\n[[Category:Science education television series]]\n[[Category:Television series by Sesame Workshop]]\n[[Category:Television shows filmed in New York (state)]]\n", "name_user": "86.154.51.111", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eBroadcast)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-2-1_Contact"}

It featured the antics of a range of [[insect|bug-like]] characters who lived in the kitchen of an unnamed house. These creatures apparently only came out when the resident humans were \"not about.\" In the third and final series the characters moved out of the house and opened a somewhat seedy restaurant (\"Bug Bites\") where they set about serving Weasel Curry to their regular clientele. 78 episodes were made in total and were repeated regularly on GMTV, [[Tiny Living]]<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20000815224654/http://www.guardian.co.uk/TV/ukliving.html</ref> and [[Channel 4]] between 1996 and 2004. \n\nAfter the first two series the show format was bought by Channel 4, which commissioned 26 further episodes. These, and the previous series, were aired in their weekend morning slot. The show was characterised by its somewhat adult references and themes, most of which went above the heads of watching children.\n\nThe 78 30-minute scripts were co-written by the director [[Peter Eyre]] and the main puppeteer, [[Francis Wright (puppeteer)|Francis Wright]]. The executive producer was Catherine Robins of [[Two Sides TV]]. The first two seasons for GMTV are now owned by [[DHX Media]] who produce former programming for [[Wild Brain]]. Episodes formerly air in HD format on many of the [[Wild Brain]] official YouTube pages until it was taken down.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n=== Main characters ===\n*Grub Bug: The father figure and chef of the family. Pompous, red and fat, he had a rather military manner and a fondness for popping down to his shed to \"tend his vegetables\". He was sensitive about his incipient balding and once sought to hide it under a ginger wig.  Very fond of Mystic Mug, they holidayed together at Frinton-on-sea.\n*Mystic Mug Bug aka Mystic Mug: Originally loosely modelled on celebrity fortune teller \"[[Mystic Meg]]\", her metier was crystal ball reading, where (in the first two series) she would retail \"Mystic Mug Bug's Amazing Facts\". Increasingly eccentric as the series progressed, she often teetered uncertainly on the edge of sanity.\n*Doodle Bug: An emotional Mr. Fix-it and artist who would design and build all manner of gadgets with which to wreak havoc over a twenty-minute time slot. Something of a sadist.\n*Plug Bug: Doodle Bug's best friend. He is a craven coward and a little flowery in nature, but stubbornly protective of his sink when it comes to what everyone puts down it. Good to his mother.\n*Buggins: Orange worm-like creature. Irritatingly enthusiastic and jolly. Regularly beaten into line by the previous two, he generally came up smiling...until the next time.\n*Grunge and Slopp: A pair of dirty, green, hairy hippie types who told jokes and sang songs. Very rarely referred to by name. They also occasionally got involved in the main action, often playing pranks on the other characters.\n*Gorgon and Zola: A husband and wife team of fuzzy worms. Aggressive to all and sundry, they were also resident jokesters. Background dancers for most of the songs.\n\n===Minor characters===\n*The Customer: Arrived in series 3. Real name; Roy, he lived in a mobile home on the side of the A3. Spent a lot of time in the caf\u00e9 but rarely actually seemed to eat anything.\n*The Health Inspector: Came and went in the course of one episode. Got stuck to Grub Bug and, after various threats, posted a glowing report on the caf\u00e9.\n*The Genie: Came, offered wishes, left.\n*Baxter: Plug Bug's dear chum, a practical joker. Came unstuck when he played one joke too many on Mystic Mug. Last seen disappearing down a large hole.\n*Bernard: A robot built by Doodle Bug with a nice/nasty switch on his back. Brought havoc over two episodes.\n*Henri: A French chef to whom Mystic Mug took rather a shine. Tied up Grub Bug and then came to a violent end.\n*Doodle Bug's Granny: Appeared in Series 2, transpired it was Doodle Bug dressed up all along.\n*Squelch: Buggins' brother. So called because that was the noise people tended to make when he sat on them.\n\n== Regular strands ==\n*Raid the Fridge: A short interstitial sequence where Grub Bug would show how to make some unspeakable [[culinary art]]. \n*In the Bin: Ditto, but involving Doodle Bug doing some [[arts and crafts]] and making something out of the items he finds in his bin.\n*Through the Washing Machine/Notice Board: Short sequence where some child demonstrated something of little interest.\n*Through the Cat Flap: Short sequence narrated by [[Rebecca Nagan]] shot from a Scottish cat's point of view as she tramped about observing humans she also went to locations across the UK\n*Mystic Mug Bug's Amazing Facts: Series 1 and 2 only. Mystic Mug presents items of trivia related to the day's topics.\n\n==Media Releases==\n* Letters, Colours and Animals VHS (1997)\n* Numbers and other stories VHS (2001)\n* Numbers and Liquid DVD

It featured the antics of a range of [[insect|bug-like]] characters who lived in the kitchen of an unnamed house. These creatures apparently only came out when the resident humans were \"not about.\" In the third and final series the characters moved out of the house and opened a somewhat seedy restaurant (\"Bug Bites\") where they set about serving Weasel Curry to their regular clientele. 78 episodes were made in total and were repeated regularly on GMTV, [[Tiny Living]]<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20000815224654/http://www.guardian.co.uk/TV/ukliving.html</ref> and [[Channel 4]] between 1996 and 2004. \n\nAfter the first two series the show format was bought by Channel 4, which commissioned 26 further episodes. These, and the previous series, were aired in their weekend morning slot. The show was characterised by its somewhat adult references and themes, most of which went above the heads of watching children.\n\nThe 78 30-minute scripts were co-written by the director [[Peter Eyre]] and the main puppeteer, [[Francis Wright (puppeteer)|Francis Wright]]. The executive producer was Catherine Robins of [[Two Sides TV]]. The first two seasons for GMTV are now owned by [[DHX Media]] who produce former programming for [[Wild Brain]]. Episodes formerly air in HD format on many of the [[Wild Brain]] official YouTube pages until it was taken down.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n=== Main characters ===\n*Grub Bug: The father figure and chef of the family. Pompous, red and fat, he had a rather military manner and a fondness for popping down to his shed to \"tend his vegetables\". He was sensitive about his incipient balding and once sought to hide it under a ginger wig.  Very fond of Mystic Mug, they holidayed together at Frinton-on-sea.\n*Mystic Mug Bug aka Mystic Mug: Originally loosely modelled on celebrity fortune teller \"[[Mystic Meg]]\", her metier was crystal ball reading, where (in the first two series) she would retail \"Mystic Mug Bug's Amazing Facts\". Increasingly eccentric as the series progressed, she often teetered uncertainly on the edge of sanity.\n*Doodle Bug: An emotional Mr. Fix-it and artist who would design and build all manner of gadgets with which to wreak havoc over a twenty-minute time slot. Something of a sadist.\n*Plug Bug: Doodle Bug's best friend. He is a craven coward and a little flowery in nature, but stubbornly protective of his sink when it comes to what everyone puts down it. Good to his mother.\n*Buggins: Orange worm-like creature. Irritatingly enthusiastic and jolly. Regularly beaten into line by the previous two, he generally came up smiling...until the next time.\n*Grunge and Slopp: A pair of dirty, green, hairy hippie types who told jokes and sang songs. Very rarely referred to by name. They also occasionally got involved in the main action, often playing pranks on the other characters.\n*Gorgon and Zola: A husband and wife team of fuzzy worms. Aggressive to all and sundry, they were also resident jokesters. Background dancers for most of the songs.\n\n===Minor characters===\n*The Customer: Arrived in series 3. Real name; Roy, he lived in a mobile home on the side of the A3. Spent a lot of time in the caf\u00e9 but rarely actually seemed to eat anything.\n*The Health Inspector: Came and went in the course of one episode. Got stuck to Grub Bug and, after various threats, posted a glowing report on the caf\u00e9.\n*The Genie: Came, offered wishes, left.\n*Baxter: Plug Bug's dear chum, a practical joker. Came unstuck when he played one joke too many on Mystic Mug. Last seen disappearing down a large hole.\n*Bernard: A robot built by Doodle Bug with a nice/nasty switch on his back. Brought havoc over two episodes.\n*Henri: A French chef to whom Mystic Mug took rather a shine. Tied up Grub Bug and then came to a violent end.\n*Doodle Bug's Granny: Appeared in Series 2, transpired it was Doodle Bug dressed up all along.\n*Squelch: Buggins' brother. So called because that was the noise people tended to make when he sat on them.\n\n== Regular strands ==\n*Raid the Fridge: A short interstitial sequence where Grub Bug would show how to make some unspeakable [[culinary art]]. \n*In the Bin: Ditto, but involving Doodle Bug doing some [[arts and crafts]] and making something out of the items he finds in his bin.\n*Through the Washing Machine/Notice Board: Short sequence where some child demonstrated something of little interest.\n*Through the Cat Flap: Short sequence narrated by [[Rebecca Nagan]] shot from a Scottish cat's point of view as she tramped about observing humans she also went to locations across the UK\n*Mystic Mug Bug's Amazing Facts: Series 1 and 2 only. Mystic Mug presents items of trivia related to the day's topics.\n\n==Media Releases==\n* Letters, Colours and Animals VHS (1997)\n* Numbers and other stories VHS (2001)\n* Numbers and Liquid DVD
