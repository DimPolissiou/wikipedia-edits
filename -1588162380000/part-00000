However, the Ottomans were not prepared to grant The League's demands. Ottoman opposition to the League's cultural goals eventually helped transform it into an Albanian national movement.\n\nAlbanian nationalism overall was a reaction to the gradual breakup of the Ottoman Empire and a response to Balkan and Christian national movements that posed a threat to an Albanian population that was mainly Muslim.<ref name=\"PutoMaurizio183\"/> Efforts were devoted to including vilayets with an Albanian population into a larger unitary Albanian autonomous province within the Ottoman state while Greater Albania was not considered a priority.<ref name=\"PutoMaurizio183\"/><ref name=\"ShawShaw288\"/><ref name=\"Kostov40\">{{harvnb|Kostov|2010|p=40}}. \"These scholars did not have access to many primary sources to be able to construct the notion of the Illyrian origin of the Albanians yet, and Greater Albania was not a priority.

In this sense, its main goal was to gather all 'Albanian' vilayet's into an autonomous province inside the Ottoman Empire. In fact, given its focus on the defence of the language, history and culture of a population spread across various regions and states, from Italy to the Balkans, it was not associated with any specific type of polity, but rather with the protection of its rights within the existing states.

The specials were produced in lieu of a full series in 2009, to allow the new production team for the programme to have enough time to prepare for the fifth series in 2010, in light of Russell T. Davies' decision to step down as showrunner. The first special was broadcast on 25 December 2008 with \"[[The Next Doctor]]\", with the last special, the two-part episode \"[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]\", broadcasting over two weeks on 25 December 2009 and 1 January 2010.\n\nThe specials started production in April 2008 for \"The Next Doctor\", and filming for the final special \"The End of Time\" began in March 2009. Two supplemental episodes were also filmed alongside the specials. \"[[Music of the Spheres (Doctor Who)|Music of the Spheres]]\" was filmed for the [[Doctor Who Prom (2008)|2008 ''Doctor Who'' Prom]] in July 2008, and the animated six-episode serial ''[[Dreamland (Doctor Who)|Dreamland]]'' was produced for the BBC's Red Button service, which was released over six consecutive days in November 2009. Midway through the sequence of specials (commencing with \"[[Planet of the Dead]]\"), production switched to filming in [[High-definition television|high-definition]].\n\nThe specials included appearances of one-off companions, portrayed by [[David Morrissey]], [[Velile Tshabalala]], [[Michelle Ryan]], [[Lindsay Duncan]] and [[Bernard Cribbins]], as well as featuring cast from previous seasons, including [[Catherine Tate]], [[Billie Piper]], [[Freema Agyeman]], [[Noel Clarke]], [[John Barrowman]], [[Elisabeth Sladen]] and [[John Simm]].

The man is investigating a series of disappearances around London and the Cybershades. They discover [[Cyberman|Cybermen]] data-storage infostamps, which the man recalls holding when he lost his memories. The Doctor realises that the man is actually Jackson Lake ([[David Morrissey]]), a missing human who believed he was the Doctor due to absorbing the data of infostamp about the Doctor.

At Naismith's mansion, the Doctor and Wilfred meet two [[Vinvocci]] disguised as humans, who assert the Gate is a harmless medical device from their homeworld. The Master activates the Gate, which he has reprogrammed to replace all of humankind's DNA with his own; only Wilfred and [[Donna Noble]] ([[Catherine Tate]]) are unchanged, and Donna remembers the Doctor.

The Lord President and an ensemble of Time Lords appear in Naismith's mansion. The Doctor and the Vinvocci bring the ship to land, the Doctor jumps from it. The Doctor debates between shooting the Master or the Lord President. The Doctor spots the same woman in white Wilfred had seen, who silently communicates to him. The Doctor fires the gun at the whitepoint star, shattering it. As Gallifrey is pulled back, Rassilon attempts to kill the Doctor, but the Master intervenes, and humanity is restored as Gallifrey returns. The Doctor finds Wilfred is now trapped in one of the Gate's control rooms that is about to be flooded by radiation. The Doctor sacrifices himself, and absorbs the radiation, but knows that his body will soon [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerate]].

the [[British television|British]] [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] programme ''[[Doctor Who]]'' are five specials that linked the programme's [[Doctor Who (series 4)|fourth]] and [[Doctor Who (series 5)|fifth series]]. The specials were produced in lieu of a full series in 2009, to allow the new production team for the programme to have enough time to prepare for the fifth series in 2010, in light of Russell T. Davies' decision to step down as showrunner. The first special was broadcast on 25 December 2008 with \"[[The Next Doctor]]\", with the last special, the two-part episode \"[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]\", broadcasting over two weeks on 25 December 2009 and 1 January 2010.\n\nThe specials started production in April 2008 for \"The Next Doctor\", and filming for the final special \"The End of Time\" began in March 2009. Two supplemental episodes were also filmed alongside the specials. \"[[Music of the Spheres (Doctor Who)|Music of the Spheres]]\" was filmed for the [[Doctor Who Prom (2008)|2008 ''Doctor Who'' Prom]] in July 2008, and the animated six-episode serial ''[[Dreamland (Doctor Who)|Dreamland]]'' was produced for the BBC's Red Button service, which was released over six consecutive days in November 2009. Midway through the sequence of specials (commencing with \"[[Planet of the Dead]]\"), production switched to filming in [[High-definition television|high-definition]].\n\nThe specials included appearances of one-off companions, portrayed by [[David Morrissey]], [[Velile Tshabalala]], [[Michelle Ryan]], [[Lindsay Duncan]] and [[Bernard Cribbins]], as well as featuring cast from previous seasons, including [[Catherine Tate]], [[Billie Piper]], [[Freema Agyeman]], [[Noel Clarke]], [[John Barrowman]], [[Elisabeth Sladen]] and [[John Simm]]. After the fourth series was the final full series to star David Tennant as the Doctor, and the last with lead writer and showrunner [[Russell T Davies]], the specials marked their official departure from the programme, with [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]] and [[Steven Moffat]] replacing them as the Doctor and the lead writer and showrunner respectively.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{See also|List of Doctor Who episodes (2005\u2013present)}}\n\"The End of Time\" was the first two-part episode with an overall title and episode numbers since ''[[Survival (Doctor Who)|Survival]]'' in [[Doctor Who (season 26)|Season 26]], the final serial broadcast during the series' original run.\n<onlyinclude>{{Episode table\n|background = #7D211E\n|overall = 6 |series = 6 |title = 20 |director = 14 |writer = 18 |airdate = 16 |prodcode = 5 |viewers = 9 |aux4 = 6 |country = UK\n|overallT   = Story\n|seriesT    = Episode\n|aux4T      = [[Appreciation Index|{{abbr|AI|Appreciation Index|style=color:white}}]]\n|aux4R      = <ref name=\"AllRatings\" />\n|viewersR   = <ref name=\"AllRatings\" />\n|episodes   =\n{{Episode list/sublist|Doctor Who (2008\u20132010 specials)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 199\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n| Title           = [[The Next Doctor]]\n| DirectedBy      = [[Andy Goddard]]\n| WrittenBy       = [[Russell T Davies]]\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2008|12|25|df=y}}\n| ProdCode        = 4.14\n| Viewers         = 13.10\n| Aux4            = 86\n| ShortSummary    = The [[Tenth Doctor]] ([[David Tennant]]) lands in Victorian London and, overhearing cries for help, encounters a man calling himself \"the Doctor\" and his companion Rosita Farisi ([[Velile Tshabalala]]), attempting to capture a [[Cyberman#Variants|Cybershade]], which escapes. The Doctor initially believes this man is a future [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|incarnation]] of himself suffering from amnesia. The man is investigating a series of disappearances around London and the Cybershades. They discover [[Cyberman|Cybermen]] data-storage infostamps, which the man recalls holding when he lost his memories. The Doctor realises that the man is actually Jackson Lake ([[David Morrissey]]), a missing human who believed he was the Doctor due to absorbing the data of infostamp about the Doctor. The Cybermen have constructed, using child labour, a \"CyberKing\" (a giant mechanical Cyberman), using their human ally Miss Hartigan ([[Dervla Kirwan]]) as its controller. The Doctor discovers another entrance to the Cybermen's base under Jackson\u2019s house. The Doctor, Jackson and Rosita manage to rescue the children, including Jackson's son. The CyberKing rampages over London. The Doctor uses the infostamps to sever Miss Hartigan's connection to the CyberKing. The emotional feedback destroys both the Cybermen and Miss Hartigan.

The Doctor contacts [[UNIT]] to return the other passengers safely to Earth. The Doctor and Christina scout ahead, while the others attempt to repair the bus, and are taken to a wrecked spaceship by two alien Tritovores. The Doctor realises that a swarm of [[stingray]]-like aliens that feed by destroying the ecosystem is approaching them. The spaceship is revealed to have been crashed by the stingrays, who kill the Tritovores. The Doctor then realises that the wormhole was created by the stingrays to move to their next feeding planet; Earth. With the swarm nearly on them, the Doctor uses technology from the spaceship and the chalice to enable the bus to fly. They fly back through the wormhole just as UNIT close it, but not before three stingrays get through, which UNIT quickly kill. Christina is arrested but the Doctor allows her to escape using the bus.

He arrives at the base, where he is detained by Captain Adelaide Brooke ([[Lindsay Duncan]]). As the crew interrogate him, he discovers that today, the base will explode, killing the entire crew. He tries to stay uninvolved, but Adelaide forces him to assist. Two crewmen appear to be in a zombie-like state, generating copious amounts of water. With the remaining crew uninfected, Adelaide orders the crew to evacuate to their rocket back to Earth while setting the base to self-destruct. The Doctor explains to Adelaide what he knows and why he cannot get involved, and begins to leave. Ed ([[Peter O'Brien (actor)|Peter O'Brien]]), the rocket's pilot, is infected, and sacrifices himself by causing the rocket to self-destruct, stranding the remaining crew. The Doctor rescues Adelaide and the surviving crew, Yuri (Aleksander Mikic) and Mia ([[Gemma Chan]]). He returns them to Earth. The Doctor insists that he has the power to change the future of the human race and no-one can stop him; Adelaide returns home and kills herself, leaving history mostly unchanged.

Arriving back on Earth on Christmas Eve, the Doctor encounters [[Wilfred Mott]] ([[Bernard Cribbins]]). The Doctor finds the Master at wastelands outside London, and learns that the Master has been suffering from hearing the sound of drums. The Master is taken by armed troops and placed in custody of Joshua Naismith ([[David Harewood]]). Naismith has recovered a broken alien \"Immortality Gate\" and wants the Master to fix its programming. The Doctor regroups with Wilfred; a woman in white warns Wilfred to arm himself to before departing. At Naismith's mansion, the Doctor and Wilfred meet two [[Vinvocci]] disguised as humans, who assert the Gate is a harmless medical device from their homeworld. The Master activates the Gate, which he has reprogrammed to replace all of humankind's DNA with his own; only Wilfred and [[Donna Noble]] ([[Catherine Tate]]) are unchanged, and Donna remembers the Doctor.

The Lord President and an ensemble of Time Lords appear in Naismith's mansion. The Doctor and the Vinvocci bring the ship to land, the Doctor jumps from it. The Doctor debates between shooting the Master or the Lord President. The Doctor spots the same woman in white Wilfred had seen, who silently communicates to him. The Doctor fires the gun at the whitepoint star, shattering it. As Gallifrey is pulled back, Rassilon attempts to kill the Doctor, but the Master intervenes, and humanity is restored as Gallifrey returns. The Doctor finds Wilfred is now trapped in one of the Gate's control rooms that is about to be flooded by radiation. The Doctor sacrifices himself, and absorbs the radiation, but knows that his body will soon [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerate]]. After returning Wilfred, the Doctor visits past companions and acquaintances.

The LCK is administered in cooperation between [[Riot Games]] and [[Korea e-Sports Association|KeSPA]].\n\nThe league was formerly named '''''League of Legends''''' '''Champions''' before undergoing a major restructuring in late 2014, which saw a change in the competition's format and a rebranding to its current name.

[[SK Telecom T1]] are the current champions of the LCK, winning their ninth title on 25 April 2020 after beating Gen.G Esports in the finals of the LCK Spring Split 2020.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Pre-LCK era (2012\u20132014) ===\nFollowing the launch of South Korea's ''[[League of Legends]]'' server in December 2011, cable broadcaster [[OGN (TV channel)|OnGameNet]] launched the country's first major ''League of Legends'' tournament in March 2012. Named ''The Champions Spring 2012'', the tournament ran from March to May and was contested by a total of 16 teams. MiG Blaze was crowned the competition's inaugural champion after defeating their organizational sibling team MiG Frost in the finals. ''The Champions Summer 2012'' followed later that year, with a rebranded MiG Frost, now known as Azubu Frost, claiming the title themselves. Azubu Frost, along with NaJin Sword, went on to represent South Korea in their first appearance at the [[League of Legends: Season 2 World Championship|''League of Legends'' World Championship]] in October.\n\nA tri-tournament annual circuit was soon set as the norm for the league's calendar year, now consisting of three seasons held in the winter, spring, and summer. Azubu Frost and NaJin Sword clashed early in 2013 in the finals of ''Champions Winter 2012-13'', with the latter emerging victorious. ''Champions Spring 2013'' and ''Champions Summer 2013'' later followed, being won by [[MVP (esports)|MVP Ozone]] and [[SK Telecom T1|SK Telecom T1 K]] respectively. SK Telecom T1 K went on to win the [[League of Legends: Season 3 World Championship|Season 3 World Championship]] later that year, becoming the first team from the league to do so.\n\nSK Telecom T1 K became the first team to successfully defend their title the following year, sweeping [[Samsung Galaxy (esports)|Samsung Galaxy Ozone]] in the finals of ''Champions Winter 2013-14'' to cap off an undefeated tournament run. Ozone's sibling team, [[Samsung Galaxy (esports)|Samsung Galaxy Blue]], went on to win ''Champions Spring 2014'' but were bested in the finals of ''Champions Summer 2014'' by [[KT Rolster|kt Rolster Arrows]].\n\nIn October 2014, plans were announced for a drastic overhaul of the league's structure.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.redbull.com/us-en/korean-professional-league-getting-overhauled|title=Korean Professional League Getting Overhauled|work=Red Bull|language=en}}</ref> '''''League of Legends'' Champions''' was rebranded to '''''League of Legends'' Champions Korea (LCK)''', and the winter season was abolished in favor of an annual circuit consisting of the Spring Split and Summer Split. The competition's format, which consisted of a 16-team tournament with a group stage progressing into a knockout stage, was changed to a 10-team league operating on a round-robin basis, with the top 5 teams qualifying for a playoffs bracket. Furthermore, organizations were prohibited from owning more than one team - in particular, this change most heavily affected [[Korea e-Sports Association|KeSPA]]-affiliated teams, all of which operated two squads as part of a sibling team system - forcing numerous organizations to merge or disband rosters.\n\n=== LCK era (2015\u2013present) ===\n''LCK Spring 2015'' marked the debut of the league operating under its new format and identity. A newly minted [[SK Telecom T1]], a product of the prior year's merger between SK Telecom T1 K and SK Telecom T1 S, swept the calendar year by winning both ''LCK Spring 2015'' and ''LCK Summer 2015''.\n\nSK Telecom T1 retained their crown in ''LCK Spring 2016'', becoming the first team in competition history to win three consecutive titles. Their streak of dominance was ended in ''LCK Summer 2016'' by [[ROX Tigers]], who became only the second team to win the league since its restructuring.\n\nSK Telecom T1 won their sixth title as an organization on 22 April 2017, by defeating [[KT Rolster]] in the finals of ''LCK Spring 2017''.

Contested by ten teams, the league runs two seasons per year and serves as a direct route to qualification for the annual [[League of Legends World Championship|''League of Legends'' World Championship]]. The LCK is administered in cooperation between [[Riot Games]] and [[Korea e-Sports Association|KeSPA]].\n\nThe league was formerly named '''''League of Legends''''' '''Champions''' before undergoing a major restructuring in late 2014, which saw a change in the competition's format and a rebranding to its current name.

[[SK Telecom T1]] are the current champions of the LCK, winning their ninth title on 25 April 2020 after beating Gen.G Esports in the finals of the LCK Spring Split 2020.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Pre-LCK era (2012\u20132014) ===\nFollowing the launch of South Korea's ''[[League of Legends]]'' server in December 2011, cable broadcaster [[OGN (TV channel)|OnGameNet]] launched the country's first major ''League of Legends'' tournament in March 2012. Named ''The Champions Spring 2012'', the tournament ran from March to May and was contested by a total of 16 teams. MiG Blaze was crowned the competition's inaugural champion after defeating their organizational sibling team MiG Frost in the finals. ''The Champions Summer 2012'' followed later that year, with a rebranded MiG Frost, now known as Azubu Frost, claiming the title themselves. Azubu Frost, along with NaJin Sword, went on to represent South Korea in their first appearance at the [[League of Legends: Season 2 World Championship|''League of Legends'' World Championship]] in October.\n\nA tri-tournament annual circuit was soon set as the norm for the league's calendar year, now consisting of three seasons held in the winter, spring, and summer. Azubu Frost and NaJin Sword clashed early in 2013 in the finals of ''Champions Winter 2012-13'', with the latter emerging victorious. ''Champions Spring 2013'' and ''Champions Summer 2013'' later followed, being won by [[MVP (esports)|MVP Ozone]] and [[SK Telecom T1|SK Telecom T1 K]] respectively. SK Telecom T1 K went on to win the [[League of Legends: Season 3 World Championship|Season 3 World Championship]] later that year, becoming the first team from the league to do so.\n\nSK Telecom T1 K became the first team to successfully defend their title the following year, sweeping [[Samsung Galaxy (esports)|Samsung Galaxy Ozone]] in the finals of ''Champions Winter 2013-14'' to cap off an undefeated tournament run. Ozone's sibling team, [[Samsung Galaxy (esports)|Samsung Galaxy Blue]], went on to win ''Champions Spring 2014'' but were bested in the finals of ''Champions Summer 2014'' by [[KT Rolster|kt Rolster Arrows]].\n\nIn October 2014, plans were announced for a drastic overhaul of the league's structure.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.redbull.com/us-en/korean-professional-league-getting-overhauled|title=Korean Professional League Getting Overhauled|work=Red Bull|language=en}}</ref> '''''League of Legends'' Champions''' was rebranded to '''''League of Legends'' Champions Korea (LCK)''', and the winter season was abolished in favor of an annual circuit consisting of the Spring Split and Summer Split. The competition's format, which consisted of a 16-team tournament with a group stage progressing into a knockout stage, was changed to a 10-team league operating on a round-robin basis, with the top 5 teams qualifying for a playoffs bracket. Furthermore, organizations were prohibited from owning more than one team - in particular, this change most heavily affected [[Korea e-Sports Association|KeSPA]]-affiliated teams, all of which operated two squads as part of a sibling team system - forcing numerous organizations to merge or disband rosters.\n\n=== LCK era (2015\u2013present) ===\n''LCK Spring 2015'' marked the debut of the league operating under its new format and identity. A newly minted [[SK Telecom T1]], a product of the prior year's merger between SK Telecom T1 K and SK Telecom T1 S, swept the calendar year by winning both ''LCK Spring 2015'' and ''LCK Summer 2015''.\n\nSK Telecom T1 retained their crown in ''LCK Spring 2016'', becoming the first team in competition history to win three consecutive titles. Their streak of dominance was ended in ''LCK Summer 2016'' by [[ROX Tigers]], who became only the second team to win the league since its restructuring.\n\nSK Telecom T1 won their sixth title as an organization on 22 April 2017, by defeating [[KT Rolster]] in the finals of ''LCK Spring 2017''. In LCK Summer 2017 Finals, [[Longzhu Gaming]] won their first title on 26 August 2017 after defeating the spring winner SK Telecom T1.\n\nLongzhu Gaming rebranded to [[Kingzone DragonX]] following the 2017 World Championship, and they defended their title in LCK 2018 Spring by defeating the Afreeca Freecs. kt Rolster won the LCK Summer 2018 championship, defeating [[Griffin (esports)|Griffin]] in the finals.\n\nSK Telecom T1 won the title for LCK Spring 2019 after defeating Griffin in the finals with 3\u20130. This marked the seventh LCK title for SK Telecom T1.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sports.news.naver.com/esports/news/read.nhn?oid=109&aid=0003989265|title=[\ub864\ucc54\uc2a4] '\uc81c\uc655\uc758 \uadc0\ud658' SK\ud154\ub808\ucf64, \uadf8\ub9ac\ud540 \uaebe\uace0 LCK \uccab 'V7' \ucd95\ubc30(\uc885\ud569)|website=sports.news.naver.com|language=ko|access-date=2019-07-10}}</ref> On August 31, 2019, SK Telecom T1 once again defeated Griffin in the finals with a score of 3\u20131.

The coin was designed by [[Chester Beach]]. Its [[obverse and reverse|obverse]] depicts the ''[[Halve Maen|Half Moon]]'', flagship of [[Henry Hudson]], after whom the city of [[Hudson, New York]] is named. In addition to showing the ship, the coin displays a version of the Hudson city seal, with [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] riding a whale, a design that has drawn commentary over the years.\n\nAlthough the city of Hudson was a relatively small municipality, legislation to issue a coin in honor of its 150th anniversary went through Congress without opposition and was signed by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], becoming the Act of May 2, 1935. In June 1935, 10,000 Hudson half dollars were distributed to civic authorities for sale to the public.\n\nMost of the coins were likely bought by coin dealers, leaving few for collectors, with the result that prices spiked from the $1 cost at the time of issue. This caused anger among coin collectors, but did not lower the coin's value, which has continued to increase in the 80-plus years since it was struck.\n\n== Background and legislation ==\n\n[[Hudson, New York]], the seat of [[Columbia County, New York|Columbia County]], lies on the east bank of the [[Hudson River]], south of [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. It was founded in 1662 under the name Claverack Landing.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=103}} Originally a trading post for the [[Manor of Rensselaerswyck|Rensselaer family]], it saw considerable expansion in the early 1780s, and was incorporated under the name Hudson in 1785. During the 1930s, it had about 14,000 residents.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=293\u2013294}}\n\nIn 1935, commemorative coins were not sold by the government\u2014Congress, in authorizing legislation, usually designated an organization which had the exclusive right to purchase them at face value and vend them to the public at a premium.{{sfn|Slabaugh|pp=3\u20135}} In the case of the Hudson half dollar, the responsible official or group was to be designated by the Mayor of Hudson.{{sfn|Flynn|p=352}}\n\nA bill for a half dollar to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the incorporation of Hudson was introduced in the House of Representatives by New York Congressman [[Philip A. Goodwin]] on March 6, 1935, and provided for 6,000 pieces. It was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures.<ref name = \"history\">{{cite web|url=https://congressional.proquest.com/legisinsight?id=PL74-48&type=LEG_HIST|title=Hudson, New York and Providence Rhode Island Anniversary Commemorative 50-Cent Pieces)|accessdate=August 8, 2017|url-access=subscription |via=ProQuest}}</ref> Goodwin was the longtime president of the [[Greene County, New York|Greene County]] Historical Society, and introduced the bill as a favor for friends in nearby Hudson.{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=102}} A report was issued by Missouri's [[John J. Cochran]], acting chairman of the committee, on April 2, 1935, recommending that the bill pass with an amendment increasing the mintage to 10,000, and noting that Goodwin had appeared before the committee to pledge that the entire quantity struck would be taken up by the city authorities, and thus there would be no coins left on the Mint's hands.{{sfn|House report|pp=1\u20132}} On April 3, immediately after the House passed a bill for the [[Old Spanish Trail half dollar]], it passed the bill for the Hudson piece on Cochran's motion, without debate or opposition. The Missouri congressman also included his report in the ''[[Congressional Record]]''.<ref>{{USCongRec|1935|4951\u20134952|date=April 3, 1935}} {{subscription}}</ref>\n\nThe bill thus passed to the Senate, where it was referred to the Committee on Banking and Currency. On April 11, 1935, New York Senator [[Robert F. Wagner]] issued a report, recommending that the bill pass unamended.{{sfn|Senate report|pp=1\u20132}} When the bill was considered in the Senate on April 15, Rhode Island's [[Jesse H. Metcalf]] moved to amend it so the bill would also provide for the issuance of a [[Rhode Island Tercentenary half dollar]]. There was no objection or debate concerning either the amendment or the bill as a whole, and it passed the Senate.<ref>{{USCongRec|1935|5643\u20135644|date=April 15, 1935}} {{subscription}}</ref>\n\nBecause the two chambers of Congress had passed different versions of the bill, it returned to the House of Representatives. There, on April 18, on motion of Cochran, the House agreed to the Senate amendments,<ref>{{USCongRec|1935|5995|date=April 18, 1935}} {{subscription}}</ref> and it was enacted on May{{nbsp}}2 by the signature of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].{{sfn|Swiatek|p=249}} Anthony Swiatek and [[Walter Breen]], in their 1988 volume on commemoratives, suggested that the bill passed because of \"probably the usual 'you vote for my bill and I'll vote for yours' arrangement\".{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|pp=101\u2013102}}\n\n== Preparation ==\n\nOn the day Roosevelt signed the legislation, Congressman Goodwin wrote to [[Charles Moore (city planner)|Charles Moore]], chairman of the [[Commission of Fine Arts]], requesting the names of suitable artists to design the coin. The commission was charged by a 1921 [[executive order]] by President [[Warren G. Harding]] with rendering advisory opinions regarding public artworks, including coins. Moore suggested [[Laura Gardin Fraser]] as standing in the first rank of medallists, with other possibilities to include Mint Chief Engraver [[John R. Sinnock]], [[Paul Manship]], Francis H. Packer and [[Chester Beach]]. Mayor Frank Wise of Hudson asked if [[John Flanagan (sculptor)|John Flanagan]], who had recently designed the [[Washington quarter]], would do; Moore agreed by telegram. However, the commission went to Beach for $1,000; the sculptor also agreed to guide the city through the coin approval process.{{sfn|Taxay|pp=v\u2013vi, 161}}\n\nWise and his officials had tentatively decided to have a head of [[Henry Hudson]] on one side of the coin, with the city seal on the other. Beach quickly prepared sketches and met with Wise on May 13, but convinced the mayor that instead of the explorer (no actual portrait of him is known) his ship, the ''[[Halve Maen|Half Moon]]'', would be a better choice. Working at speed unusual for a commemorative coin of that era, Beach completed plaster models in one week, adding a crescent moon to the left of the ship. The models were converted to coinage dies by the [[Medallic Art Company]] of New York, who could accomplish the task faster than the [[Philadelphia Mint]]. Though records are not complete, the company apparently contacted the Mint for advice; Chief Engraver Sinnock sent it a letter on May 23. While unfamiliar with the Hudson legislation, Sinnock had confidence in Beach's ability because his previous designs were easy for the Mint to strike into coins. Beach quoted this praise in reporting to Moore on May 27 that [[Lee Lawrie]], the sculptor-member of the Commission of Fine Arts, had approved the designs. Approval by the full commission followed on May 28, and by Secretary of the Treasury [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.|Henry Morgenthau]] a week later.{{sfn|Taxay|pp=161\u2013166}}\n\n== Design ==\n\nThe [[obverse and reverse|obverse]] of the coin shows the ''[[Halve Maen|Half Moon]]'', Henry Hudson's flagship, sailing to the right. To the left of the [[Cargo ship|merchantman]]'s rigging is a stylized crescent moon. The ship is surrounded with two rings of lettering, the inner reading \"[[In God We Trust|{{small|IN GOD WE TRUST}}]]\" and {{small|HUDSON}}, and the outer the name of the country and the coin's denomination. The designer's monogram, {{small|CB}}, may be found at the waterline on the left side of the coin.

The coin was designed by [[Chester Beach]]. Its [[obverse and reverse|obverse]] depicts the ''[[Halve Maen|Half Moon]]'', flagship of [[Henry Hudson]], after whom the city of [[Hudson, New York]] is named. In addition to showing the ship, the coin displays a version of the Hudson city seal, with [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] riding a whale, a design that has drawn commentary over the years.\n\nAlthough the city of Hudson was a relatively small municipality, legislation to issue a coin in honor of its 150th anniversary went through Congress without opposition and was signed by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], becoming the Act of May 2, 1935. In June 1935, 10,000 Hudson half dollars were distributed to civic authorities for sale to the public.\n\nMost of the coins were likely bought by coin dealers, leaving few for collectors, with the result that prices spiked from the $1 cost at the time of issue. This caused anger among coin collectors, but did not lower the coin's value, which has continued to increase in the 80-plus years since it was struck.\n\n== Background and legislation ==\n\n[[Hudson, New York]], the seat of [[Columbia County, New York|Columbia County]], lies on the east bank of the [[Hudson River]], south of [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. It was founded in 1662 under the name Claverack Landing.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=103}} Originally a trading post for the [[Manor of Rensselaerswyck|Rensselaer family]], it saw considerable expansion in the early 1780s, and was incorporated under the name Hudson in 1785. During the 1930s, it had about 14,000 residents.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=293\u2013294}}\n\nIn 1935, commemorative coins were not sold by the government\u2014Congress, in authorizing legislation, usually designated an organization which had the exclusive right to purchase them at face value and vend them to the public at a premium.{{sfn|Slabaugh|pp=3\u20135}} In the case of the Hudson half dollar, the responsible official or group was to be designated by the Mayor of Hudson.{{sfn|Flynn|p=352}}\n\nA bill for a half dollar to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the incorporation of Hudson was introduced in the House of Representatives by New York Congressman [[Philip A. Goodwin]] on March 6, 1935, and provided for 6,000 pieces. It was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures.<ref name = \"history\">{{cite web|url=https://congressional.proquest.com/legisinsight?id=PL74-48&type=LEG_HIST|title=Hudson, New York and Providence Rhode Island Anniversary Commemorative 50-Cent Pieces)|accessdate=August 8, 2017|url-access=subscription |via=ProQuest}}</ref> Goodwin was the longtime president of the [[Greene County, New York|Greene County]] Historical Society, and introduced the bill as a favor for friends in nearby Hudson.{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=102}} A report was issued by Missouri's [[John J. Cochran]], acting chairman of the committee, on April 2, 1935, recommending that the bill pass with an amendment increasing the mintage to 10,000, and noting that Goodwin had appeared before the committee to pledge that the entire quantity struck would be taken up by the city authorities, and thus there would be no coins left on the Mint's hands.{{sfn|House report|pp=1\u20132}} On April 3, immediately after the House passed a bill for the [[Old Spanish Trail half dollar]], it passed the bill for the Hudson piece on Cochran's motion, without debate or opposition. The Missouri congressman also included his report in the ''[[Congressional Record]]''.<ref>{{USCongRec|1935|4951\u20134952|date=April 3, 1935}} {{subscription}}</ref>\n\nThe bill thus passed to the Senate, where it was referred to the Committee on Banking and Currency. On April 11, 1935, New York Senator [[Robert F. Wagner]] issued a report, recommending that the bill pass unamended.{{sfn|Senate report|pp=1\u20132}} When the bill was considered in the Senate on April 15, Rhode Island's [[Jesse H. Metcalf]] moved to amend it so the bill would also provide for the issuance of a [[Rhode Island Tercentenary half dollar]]. There was no objection or debate concerning either the amendment or the bill as a whole, and it passed the Senate.<ref>{{USCongRec|1935|5643\u20135644|date=April 15, 1935}} {{subscription}}</ref>\n\nBecause the two chambers of Congress had passed different versions of the bill, it returned to the House of Representatives. There, on April 18, on motion of Cochran, the House agreed to the Senate amendments,<ref>{{USCongRec|1935|5995|date=April 18, 1935}} {{subscription}}</ref> and it was enacted on May{{nbsp}}2 by the signature of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].{{sfn|Swiatek|p=249}} Anthony Swiatek and [[Walter Breen]], in their 1988 volume on commemoratives, suggested that the bill passed because of \"probably the usual 'you vote for my bill and I'll vote for yours' arrangement\".{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|pp=101\u2013102}}\n\n== Preparation ==\n\nOn the day Roosevelt signed the legislation, Congressman Goodwin wrote to [[Charles Moore (city planner)|Charles Moore]], chairman of the [[Commission of Fine Arts]], requesting the names of suitable artists to design the coin. The commission was charged by a 1921 [[executive order]] by President [[Warren G. Harding]] with rendering advisory opinions regarding public artworks, including coins. Moore suggested [[Laura Gardin Fraser]] as standing in the first rank of medallists, with other possibilities to include Mint Chief Engraver [[John R. Sinnock]], [[Paul Manship]], Francis H. Packer and [[Chester Beach]]. Mayor Frank Wise of Hudson asked if [[John Flanagan (sculptor)|John Flanagan]], who had recently designed the [[Washington quarter]], would do; Moore agreed by telegram. However, the commission went to Beach for $1,000; the sculptor also agreed to guide the city through the coin approval process.{{sfn|Taxay|pp=v\u2013vi, 161}}\n\nWise and his officials had tentatively decided to have a head of [[Henry Hudson]] on one side of the coin, with the city seal on the other. Beach quickly prepared sketches and met with Wise on May 13, but convinced the mayor that instead of the explorer (no actual portrait of him is known) his ship, the ''[[Halve Maen|Half Moon]]'', would be a better choice. Working at speed unusual for a commemorative coin of that era, Beach completed plaster models in one week, adding a crescent moon to the left of the ship. The models were converted to coinage dies by the [[Medallic Art Company]] of New York, who could accomplish the task faster than the [[Philadelphia Mint]]. Though records are not complete, the company apparently contacted the Mint for advice; Chief Engraver Sinnock sent it a letter on May 23. While unfamiliar with the Hudson legislation, Sinnock had confidence in Beach's ability because his previous designs were easy for the Mint to strike into coins. Beach quoted this praise in reporting to Moore on May 27 that [[Lee Lawrie]], the sculptor-member of the Commission of Fine Arts, had approved the designs. Approval by the full commission followed on May 28, and by Secretary of the Treasury [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.|Henry Morgenthau]] a week later.{{sfn|Taxay|pp=161\u2013166}}\n\n== Design ==\n\nThe [[obverse and reverse|obverse]] of the coin shows the ''[[Halve Maen|Half Moon]]'', Henry Hudson's flagship, sailing to the right. To the left of the [[Cargo ship|merchantman]]'s rigging is a stylized crescent moon. The ship is surrounded with two rings of lettering, the inner reading \"[[In God We Trust|{{small|IN GOD WE TRUST}}]]\" and {{small|HUDSON}}, and the outer the name of the country and the coin's denomination. The designer's monogram, {{small|CB}}, may be found at the waterline on the left side of the coin. The reverse is a rendition of the city of Hudson's seal, with [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] holding a trident, riding backward on a whale. A mermaid or [[Triton (mythology)|triton]] in the background blows into a conch shell.{{sfn|Swiatek|pp=249\u2013250}} The seal design reflects Hudson's heritage as a whaling port, although it is some distance up the [[Hudson River]] from the ocean.{{sfn|Taxay|p=166}} The motto {{small|ED DECUS ET PRETIUM RECTI}} (''Both the honor and the reward of the righteous'') is copied from the city seal; the name of the city and the anniversary dates surround the seal, with [[E pluribus unum|{{small|E PLURIBUS UNUM}}]] above the dates.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=250}}\n\n[[Don Taxay]], in his book on commemorative coins, described the seal as \"a rather whimsical composition\";{{sfn|Taxay|p=161}} Beach had deemed it \"rather amusing\" and had hoped the new coins \"will be a little more interesting than the others I have done\".{{sfn|Taxay|p=165}} Swiatek and Breen referenced \"the quaint device of King Neptune riding backwards on a spouting whale, whose eye is represented as being about where its blowhole should be.

A member of the [[Flavian dynasty]], Titus succeeded his father [[Vespasian]] upon his death, thus becoming the first Roman emperor to come to the throne after his own biological father.\n\nBefore becoming emperor, Titus gained renown as a military commander, serving under his father in [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]] during the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War]]. The campaign came to a brief halt with the death of emperor [[Nero]] in 68, launching Vespasian's bid for the imperial power during the [[Year of the Four Emperors]]. When Vespasian was declared Emperor on 1 July 69, Titus was left in charge of ending the Jewish rebellion. In 70, he [[Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE)|besieged and captured Jerusalem]], and destroyed the city and the [[Second Temple]]. For this achievement Titus was awarded a [[Roman triumph|triumph]]; the [[Arch of Titus]] commemorates his victory to this day.\n\nDuring his father's rule, Titus gained notoriety in Rome serving as [[Praetorian prefect|prefect]] of the [[Praetorian Guard]], and for carrying on a controversial relationship with the Jewish queen [[Berenice (daughter of Agrippa I)|Berenice]]. Despite concerns over his character, Titus ruled to great acclaim following the death of Vespasian in 79, and was considered a good emperor by [[Suetonius]] and other contemporary historians.\n\nAs emperor, Titus is best known for completing the [[Colosseum]] and for his generosity in relieving the suffering caused by two disasters, the [[eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79]] and a fire in Rome in 80. After barely two years in office, Titus died of a fever on 13 September 81. He was [[apotheosis|deified]] by the [[Roman Senate]] and succeeded by his younger brother [[Domitian]].\n\n==Early life==\nTitus was born in [[Rome]], probably on 30 December 39 AD, as the eldest son of [[Vespasian|Titus Flavius Vespasianus]]\u2014commonly known as Vespasian\u2014and [[Domitilla the Elder]].<ref>Suetonius claims Titus was born in the year Caligula was assassinated, 41. However, this contradicts his statement that Titus died in his 42nd year, as well as Cassius Dio, who notes that Titus was 39 at the time of his accession.

All the surviving accounts from this period, many of them written by his own contemporaries, present a highly favorable view toward Titus. His character has especially prospered in comparison with that of his brother Domitian.\n\n''[[The Wars of the Jews]]'' offers a first-hand, eye-witness account of the Jewish rebellion and the character of Titus. The neutrality of [[Josephus]]' writings has come into question however, as he was heavily indebted to the [[Flavian dynasty|Flavians]]. In 71, he arrived in Rome in the entourage of Titus, became a [[Roman citizenship|Roman citizen]] and took on the Roman [[Roman naming conventions|nomen]] Flavius and [[praenomen]] Titus from his patrons. He received an annual pension and lived in the palace.<ref>[[Josephus]], ''[[The Life of Flavius Josephus]]'' [[wikisource:The Life of Flavius Josephus#76|76]]</ref>\n\nIt was while in Rome, and under Flavian patronage, that Josephus wrote all of his known works. ''The War of the Jews'' is heavily slanted against the leaders of the revolt, portraying the rebellion as weak and unorganized, and even blaming the Jews for causing the war.<ref>[[Josephus]], ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]'' [[wikisource:The War of the Jews/Book II#Chapter 17|II.17]]</ref> The credibility of Josephus as a historian has subsequently come under fire.<ref>Josephus, Flavius, ''The Jewish War'', tr. G.A. Williamson, introduction by E. Mary Smallwood.  New York, Penguin, 1981, p. 24</ref>\n\nAnother contemporary of Titus was [[Tacitus|Publius Cornelius Tacitus]], who started his public career in 80 or 81 and credits the Flavian dynasty with his elevation.<ref>[[Tacitus]], ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]'' [[wikisource:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 1#1|I.1]]</ref> ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|The Histories]]''\u2014his account of this period\u2014was published during the reign of [[Trajan]]. Unfortunately only the first five books from this work have survived until the present day, with the text on Titus's and Domitian's reign entirely lost.\n\n[[Suetonius|Suetonius Tranquilius]] gives a short but highly favourable account on Titus's reign in ''[[On the Life of the Caesars|The Lives of Twelve Caesars]]'',<ref name=\"suetonius-titus-1\">[[Suetonius]], ''[[On the Life of the Caesars|The Lives of Twelve Caesars]]'', Life of Titus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Titus*.html#1 1]</ref> emphasizing his military achievements and his generosity as Emperor, in short describing him as follows:\n\n<blockquote>Titus, of the same surname as his father, was the delight and darling of the human race; such surpassing ability had he, by nature, art, or good fortune, to win the affections of all men, and that, too, which is no easy task, while he was emperor.<ref name=\"suetonius-titus-1\"/></blockquote>\n\nFinally, [[Cassius Dio]] wrote his ''[[Roman History (Cassius Dio)|Roman History]]'' over a hundred years after the death of Titus. He shares a similar outlook as Suetonius, possibly even using the latter as a source, but is more reserved, noting:\n\n<blockquote>His satisfactory record may also have been due to the fact that he survived his accession but a very short time, for he was thus given no opportunity for wrongdoing. For he lived after this only two years, two months and twenty days\u2014in addition to the thirty-nine years, five months and twenty-five days he had already lived at that time. In this respect, indeed, he is regarded as having equalled the long reign of [[Augustus]], since it is maintained that Augustus would never have been loved had he lived a shorter time, nor Titus had he lived longer. For Augustus, though at the outset he showed himself rather harsh because of the wars and the factional strife, was later able, in the course of time, to achieve a brilliant reputation for his kindly deeds; Titus, on the other hand, ruled with mildness and died at the height of his glory, whereas, if he had lived a long time, it might have been shown that he owes his present fame more to good fortune than to merit.<ref name=\"dio-romanhistory-lxvi-18\"/></blockquote>\n\n[[Pliny the Elder]], who later died during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius,<ref>[http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/pompeii.htm The Destruction of Pompeii, 79 AD], Translation of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]'s letters. [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/pliny.ep6.html Original.]</ref> dedicated his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]]'' to Titus.<ref>[[Pliny the Elder]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural Histories]]'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/holland/plinyepistle.html Preface]</ref>\n\nIn contrast to the ideal portrayal of Titus in Roman histories, in Jewish memory \"Titus the Wicked\" is remembered as an evil oppressor and destroyer of the Temple.

A member of the [[Flavian dynasty]], Titus succeeded his father [[Vespasian]] upon his death, thus becoming the first Roman emperor to come to the throne after his own biological father.\n\nBefore becoming emperor, Titus gained renown as a military commander, serving under his father in [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]] during the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War]]. The campaign came to a brief halt with the death of emperor [[Nero]] in 68, launching Vespasian's bid for the imperial power during the [[Year of the Four Emperors]]. When Vespasian was declared Emperor on 1 July 69, Titus was left in charge of ending the Jewish rebellion. In 70, he [[Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE)|besieged and captured Jerusalem]], and destroyed the city and the [[Second Temple]]. For this achievement Titus was awarded a [[Roman triumph|triumph]]; the [[Arch of Titus]] commemorates his victory to this day.\n\nDuring his father's rule, Titus gained notoriety in Rome serving as [[Praetorian prefect|prefect]] of the [[Praetorian Guard]], and for carrying on a controversial relationship with the Jewish queen [[Berenice (daughter of Agrippa I)|Berenice]]. Despite concerns over his character, Titus ruled to great acclaim following the death of Vespasian in 79, and was considered a good emperor by [[Suetonius]] and other contemporary historians.\n\nAs emperor, Titus is best known for completing the [[Colosseum]] and for his generosity in relieving the suffering caused by two disasters, the [[eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79]] and a fire in Rome in 80. After barely two years in office, Titus died of a fever on 13 September 81. He was [[apotheosis|deified]] by the [[Roman Senate]] and succeeded by his younger brother [[Domitian]].\n\n==Early life==\nTitus was born in [[Rome]], probably on 30 December 39 AD, as the eldest son of [[Vespasian|Titus Flavius Vespasianus]]\u2014commonly known as Vespasian\u2014and [[Domitilla the Elder]].<ref>Suetonius claims Titus was born in the year Caligula was assassinated, 41. However, this contradicts his statement that Titus died in his 42nd year, as well as Cassius Dio, who notes that Titus was 39 at the time of his accession.

All the surviving accounts from this period, many of them written by his own contemporaries, present a highly favorable view toward Titus. His character has especially prospered in comparison with that of his brother Domitian.\n\n''[[The Wars of the Jews]]'' offers a first-hand, eye-witness account of the Jewish rebellion and the character of Titus. The neutrality of [[Josephus]]' writings has come into question however, as he was heavily indebted to the [[Flavian dynasty|Flavians]]. In 71, he arrived in Rome in the entourage of Titus, became a [[Roman citizenship|Roman citizen]] and took on the Roman [[Roman naming conventions|nomen]] Flavius and [[praenomen]] Titus from his patrons. He received an annual pension and lived in the palace.<ref>[[Josephus]], ''[[The Life of Flavius Josephus]]'' [[wikisource:The Life of Flavius Josephus#76|76]]</ref>\n\nIt was while in Rome, and under Flavian patronage, that Josephus wrote all of his known works. ''The War of the Jews'' is heavily slanted against the leaders of the revolt, portraying the rebellion as weak and unorganized, and even blaming the Jews for causing the war.<ref>[[Josephus]], ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]'' [[wikisource:The War of the Jews/Book II#Chapter 17|II.17]]</ref> The credibility of Josephus as a historian has subsequently come under fire.<ref>Josephus, Flavius, ''The Jewish War'', tr. G.A. Williamson, introduction by E. Mary Smallwood.  New York, Penguin, 1981, p. 24</ref>\n\nAnother contemporary of Titus was [[Tacitus|Publius Cornelius Tacitus]], who started his public career in 80 or 81 and credits the Flavian dynasty with his elevation.<ref>[[Tacitus]], ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]'' [[wikisource:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 1#1|I.1]]</ref> ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|The Histories]]''\u2014his account of this period\u2014was published during the reign of [[Trajan]]. Unfortunately only the first five books from this work have survived until the present day, with the text on Titus's and Domitian's reign entirely lost.\n\n[[Suetonius|Suetonius Tranquilius]] gives a short but highly favourable account on Titus's reign in ''[[On the Life of the Caesars|The Lives of Twelve Caesars]]'',<ref name=\"suetonius-titus-1\">[[Suetonius]], ''[[On the Life of the Caesars|The Lives of Twelve Caesars]]'', Life of Titus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Titus*.html#1 1]</ref> emphasizing his military achievements and his generosity as Emperor, in short describing him as follows:\n\n<blockquote>Titus, of the same surname as his father, was the delight and darling of the human race; such surpassing ability had he, by nature, art, or good fortune, to win the affections of all men, and that, too, which is no easy task, while he was emperor.<ref name=\"suetonius-titus-1\"/></blockquote>\n\nFinally, [[Cassius Dio]] wrote his ''[[Roman History (Cassius Dio)|Roman History]]'' over a hundred years after the death of Titus. He shares a similar outlook as Suetonius, possibly even using the latter as a source, but is more reserved, noting:\n\n<blockquote>His satisfactory record may also have been due to the fact that he survived his accession but a very short time, for he was thus given no opportunity for wrongdoing. For he lived after this only two years, two months and twenty days\u2014in addition to the thirty-nine years, five months and twenty-five days he had already lived at that time. In this respect, indeed, he is regarded as having equalled the long reign of [[Augustus]], since it is maintained that Augustus would never have been loved had he lived a shorter time, nor Titus had he lived longer. For Augustus, though at the outset he showed himself rather harsh because of the wars and the factional strife, was later able, in the course of time, to achieve a brilliant reputation for his kindly deeds; Titus, on the other hand, ruled with mildness and died at the height of his glory, whereas, if he had lived a long time, it might have been shown that he owes his present fame more to good fortune than to merit.<ref name=\"dio-romanhistory-lxvi-18\"/></blockquote>\n\n[[Pliny the Elder]], who later died during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius,<ref>[http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/pompeii.htm The Destruction of Pompeii, 79 AD], Translation of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]'s letters. [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/pliny.ep6.html Original.]</ref> dedicated his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]]'' to Titus.<ref>[[Pliny the Elder]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural Histories]]'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/holland/plinyepistle.html Preface]</ref>\n\nIn contrast to the ideal portrayal of Titus in Roman histories, in Jewish memory \"Titus the Wicked\" is remembered as an evil oppressor and destroyer of the Temple.  For example, one legend in the Babylonian Talmud describes Titus as having had sex with a whore on a Torah scroll inside the Temple during its destruction.<ref>Babylonian Talmud (Gittin 56b)</ref>\n\n===Titus in later arts===\n[[Image:The Triumph of Titus Alma Tadema.jpg|thumb|250px|''The Triumph of Titus'', by Sir [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]] (1885). The composition suggests a love affair between Titus and Domitian's wife [[Domitia Longina]] (see below).]]\nThe war in Judaea and the life of Titus, particularly his relationship with Berenice, have inspired writers and artists through the centuries. The [[bas-relief]] in the Arch of Titus has been influential in the depiction of the [[destruction of Jerusalem]], with the [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]] frequently being used to symbolise the looting of the [[Second Temple]].\n\n====Literature====\n*The early medieval Christian text ''[[Vindicta Salvatoris]]'' anachronistically portrays Titus as Roman client king of Libya, north of Judah.<ref name=\"ehrman/plese 523\">Ehrman and Ple\u0161e (2011), p. 523.</ref>\n*''[[B\u00e9r\u00e9nice]]'', a play by [[Jean Racine]] (1670) which focuses on the love affair between Titus and Berenice.\n*''[[Tite et B\u00e9r\u00e9nice]]'', a play by [[Pierre Corneille]] which was in competition with Racine the same year, and concerns the same subject matter.\n*''[[La clemenza di Tito]]'', an [[opera]] by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], that centers around a plot to kill Emperor Titus instigated by Vitellia, daughter of [[Vitellius]], in order to gain what she believes to be her rightful place as Queen.\n*The ''Josephus Trilogy'', novels by [[Lion Feuchtwanger]], about the life of [[Josephus|Flavius Josephus]] and his relation with the Flavian dynasty.\n**''Der j\u00fcdische Krieg'' (''Josephus''), 1932\n**''Die S\u00f6hne'' (''The Jews of Rome''), 1935\n**''Der Tag wird kommen'' (''The day will come'', ''Josephus and the Emperor''), 1942\n*The ''[[Marcus Didius Falco]]'' novels, which take place during the reign of Vespasian.\n*Titus figures prominently in \"[[The Pearl-Maiden]]\", a novel by [[H.
