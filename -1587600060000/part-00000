He was named after his father's bunkmate in the [[68th Ohio Infantry|68th Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] during the [[American Civil War]]. He had a sister Bertha.\n\nAs of the [[1880 United States Census]], the Oldfields lived in Wauseon. In 1889 they moved to [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], where the father Henry got a job at the state mental asylum. In the summer of 1891, Berna worked as a waterboy in order to purchase his first bicycle. According to legend, he spent most of his Sunday afternoons at the local Toledo fire station, hoping for the next call. As the company's \u201cmascot\u201d, he was allowed to ride the big red hose wagon, pulled by a pair of horses that raced through the streets. The following year, Berna worked after school selling the ''[[Toledo Blade]]'' and ''Toledo Bee'' newspapers.\n\nOldfield dropped out of school after the eighth grade in 1892. He started working with his father as a kitchen helper at the mental asylum during the day and a [[bellhop]] at the downtown hotel at night. He eventually worked at the hotel full-time, as he preferred it to working around mental patients. Purportedly the bell captain said that \"Berna\u201d was a sissy name, so he changed it to \u201cBarney\u201d. Oldfield was described as having a \"magnetic personality\", and received many tips at the hotel. He used them to buy his first bike, an \"Advance Traveller\" with pneumatic tires.\n\n===Bicycle racer===\nClarence Brigham, who sold the \u201cCleveland\u201d brand bike, and Edward G. Eager (of Eager & Green Mercantile) who sold the \u201cColumbia\u201d models in his store, organized the Wauseon Cycle Club in their town. They wanted both to increase bicycle sales and draw more people to the town via the [[Michigan Lake Shore Railroad]]. Other cycling groups in Swanton, Clyde, Monroe, Adrian, Blissfield, and Toledo were part of the same cycle racing circuit. \n\nBicyclists raced in half-mile and mile classes on public racetracks usually reserved for horse racing. Other members of the Club included Fred Ballmeyer, Ora Brailey, Curt and Buff Harrison, Doc Myers, Emil Winzeler, Doc Miley, Frank Harper, Dan Raymond (who fixed everyone's bikes), Sid Black (a trick cyclist from Cleveland who later became president of the [[Packard Motor Company]]), and Barney Oldfield. In October 1892, the second \u201cSilver Tournament\u201d was held in Wauseon.  \n\nIn 1893, Oldfield began working as an elevator operator at a different hotel. Every night he stored one hotel tenant's lightweight \"Cleveland\" cycle in the basement; he sometimes \"borrowed it\", riding it at night.\n\nAt age 16, Oldfield began serious bicycle racing in 1894 after officials from the \"Dauntless\" bicycle factory asked him to ride for the [[Ohio]] state championship.<ref name=\"hof\"/> Although he came in second, the race was a turning point. Oldfield was hired as a parts sales representative for the [[Stearns (automobile)|Stearns]] bicycle factory.

One was [[Ford 999|\"No. 999\"]], which was debuted in October 1902 at the Manufacturer's Challenge Cup. Today it is displayed at the [[Henry Ford Museum]] in Greenfield Village, Michigan.\n\nOldfield agreed to drive against the current champion, [[Alexander Winton]].

Oldfield raced his [[Fiat]] car against Beachey's [[biplane]]s in at least 35 matches, [[Barnstorm (sports)|barnstorming]] the country. In the more remote areas, they raced at county fair horse tracks.

In 1915 he won the [[Venice, California|Venice]], California 300 road race.\n\nIn November 1914 he won the Los Angeles-to-Phoenix Cactus Derby Race; the victor's medal proclaimed him \u201cMaster Driver of the World\u201d. On May 28, 1916, he became the first person to lap the Indianapolis Speedway at more than 100&nbsp;mph in the front-wheel-drive \"Christie Racer\", designed by [[John Walter Christie]]. He used the Blitzen Benz to break the existing mile, two-mile, and kilometer records at the [[Daytona Beach Road Course]] at [[Ormond, Florida|Ormond]], Florida.

Oldfield and [[Harry Arminius Miller]], who developed and built [[carburetor]]s and was one of the most famous engine builders, worked after that to design a racecar that was not only fast and durable, but would protect the driver in the event of an accident.  They built a racecar with a [[roll cage]] inside a streamlined driver's compartment, which completely enclosed the driver, calling it the \"[[Golden Submarine]]\".\n\n===Business ventures===\n[[File:Barney Oldfield tire ad.png|thumbnail|left|Barney Oldfield tire ad from 1922]]\nOldfield helped fellow racer [[Carl G.

In 1889 they moved to [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], where the father Henry got a job at the state mental asylum. In the summer of 1891, Berna worked as a waterboy in order to purchase his first bicycle. According to legend, he spent most of his Sunday afternoons at the local Toledo fire station, hoping for the next call. As the company's \u201cmascot\u201d, he was allowed to ride the big red hose wagon, pulled by a pair of horses that raced through the streets. The following year, Berna worked after school selling the ''[[Toledo Blade]]'' and ''Toledo Bee'' newspapers.\n\nOldfield dropped out of school after the eighth grade in 1892. He started working with his father as a kitchen helper at the mental asylum during the day and a [[bellhop]] at the downtown hotel at night. He eventually worked at the hotel full-time, as he preferred it to working around mental patients. Purportedly the bell captain said that \"Berna\u201d was a sissy name, so he changed it to \u201cBarney\u201d. Oldfield was described as having a \"magnetic personality\", and received many tips at the hotel. He used them to buy his first bike, an \"Advance Traveller\" with pneumatic tires.\n\n===Bicycle racer===\nClarence Brigham, who sold the \u201cCleveland\u201d brand bike, and Edward G. Eager (of Eager & Green Mercantile) who sold the \u201cColumbia\u201d models in his store, organized the Wauseon Cycle Club in their town. They wanted both to increase bicycle sales and draw more people to the town via the [[Michigan Lake Shore Railroad]]. Other cycling groups in Swanton, Clyde, Monroe, Adrian, Blissfield, and Toledo were part of the same cycle racing circuit. \n\nBicyclists raced in half-mile and mile classes on public racetracks usually reserved for horse racing. Other members of the Club included Fred Ballmeyer, Ora Brailey, Curt and Buff Harrison, Doc Myers, Emil Winzeler, Doc Miley, Frank Harper, Dan Raymond (who fixed everyone's bikes), Sid Black (a trick cyclist from Cleveland who later became president of the [[Packard Motor Company]]), and Barney Oldfield. In October 1892, the second \u201cSilver Tournament\u201d was held in Wauseon.  \n\nIn 1893, Oldfield began working as an elevator operator at a different hotel. Every night he stored one hotel tenant's lightweight \"Cleveland\" cycle in the basement; he sometimes \"borrowed it\", riding it at night.\n\nAt age 16, Oldfield began serious bicycle racing in 1894 after officials from the \"Dauntless\" bicycle factory asked him to ride for the [[Ohio]] state championship.<ref name=\"hof\"/> Although he came in second, the race was a turning point. Oldfield was hired as a parts sales representative for the [[Stearns (automobile)|Stearns]] bicycle factory.

One was [[Ford 999|\"No. 999\"]], which was debuted in October 1902 at the Manufacturer's Challenge Cup.
