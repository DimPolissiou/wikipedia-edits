On April 19, 1775, the first day of the [[American Revolutionary War]], provincial [[minutemen]] and [[Militia (United States)|militia]] companies numbering approximately 400 engaged roughly 90 [[British Army during the American Revolutionary War|British Army]] troops at this location. The battle was the first instance in which American forces advanced in formation on the British [[Regular Army|regulars]], inflicted casualties, and routed their opponents. It was a pivotal moment in the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] and in American history. The significance of the historic events at the North Bridge inspired [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] to refer to the moment as the \"[[shot heard round the world]].\"\n\nThere were at least eight iterations of the North Bridge constructed over four centuries. The current wooden pedestrian bridge, an approximate replica of the bridge that stood at the time of the battle, was built in 1956 and extensively restored in 2005. The bridge and the surrounding 114 acres of land make up what is known as the North Bridge unit of the [[Minute Man National Historical Park]] and is managed by the [[National Park Service]]. It is a popular tourist destination.\n\n==Origin and earliest iterations==\nThe Town of Concord was settled in 1635. Over the next two decades, colonial settlers established farms in the north quarter of the town. Many of these farms lay on the opposite side of the Concord River from the town center. To facilitate travel from their farms to the town, north quarter land owners built a bridge over the Concord River at or near this location by the early 1650s. The first mention of a bridge at this location appears in town records in 1654.{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=12}} The farm road crossing the bridge was later improved and came to be known as the [[Groton, Massachusetts|Groton]] Road.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=14}}\n\nSpring flooding of the river and deterioration required the replacement of the bridge approximately every 20 to 30 years. Colonial records suggest that the bridge was likely replaced in 1660, again around 1683, again around 1710, and again in 1731.{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=16}}{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=18}} In 1760, the town constructed a new bridge at this site. This version was the one that was present during the Concord Fight on April 19, 1775.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=19}}\n\n==\"Concord Fight\"==\n{{main|Battle of Concord#The North Bridge}}\n[[File:North Bridge Fight Detail.jpg|thumb|A 1775 drawing by [[Amos Doolittle]] of the engagement at the North Bridge based on witness accounts his own inspection of the bridge]]The engagement which took place at the North Bridge has historically been known as the \"Concord Fight\" and was a part of the larger [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]]. On April 18, 1775, General [[Thomas Gage]], the military Governor of [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]], dispatched a force of roughly 700 British soldiers from [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] to confiscate or destroy military supplies being stockpiled in Concord by the rebellious [[Massachusetts Provincial Congress]].{{sfnp|Galvin|1989|p=99}} On their way to Concord, this force encountered a small group of militia on [[Lexington Battle Green|Lexington Green]]. After a brief skirmish there, the British soldiers marched on to Concord. Soon after reaching the town, [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Francis Smith (British Army officer)|Francis Smith]] sent six [[Company (military unit)|companies]] across the North Bridge to search provincial Colonel [[James Barrett (colonel)|Colonel James Barrett's]] farm for munitions. Three of these companies went on to Barrett's farm while three, totaling roughly 90 men, held the North Bridge. These were the British [[light infantry]] companies from the 4th, 10th, and 43rd Regiments of Foot under [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] Walter Laurie.{{sfnp|Galvin|1989|pp=140-141}} These companies initially held positions on the western side of the bridge but when the provincials advanced, they crossed the bridge and took up a position on the eastern bank.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=26}}\n\nAt about 10:30, the provincials advanced in military order with the intention of taking the bridge and moving on to the center of town to prevent the British from burning the village.{{sfnp|Fischer|1994|p=211}} As they advanced the British fired a few warning shots followed by a full volley. Several provincials were killed or wounded in this first round of firing. Seeing these casualties, Major John Buttrick of Concord, in command of the provincial column, commanded, \"Fire, fellow soldiers, for God's sake fire!\" and the provincials returned fire, causing the British to immediately retreat back to Concord.{{sfnp|Fischer|1994|p=214}} Three British soldiers were killed and nine wounded. On the provincial side two were killed and four wounded.{{sfnp|Minute Man National Historical Park|2020|}}\n\nThis first instance of Americans fighting in military order and firing to deadly effect on British troops was a key turning point in the Battles of Lexington and Concord. It precipitated the British retreat back to Boston and is regarded as one of the most significant events in American history.{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=12}}\n\n==Later iterations of the bridge==\n[[File:The Cambridge book of poetry and song (1882) (14780275725).jpg|thumb|upright|An 1882 drawing of the Centennial Bridge with covered pavilions]]In 1788, a new bridge was constructed to replace the 1760 structure which had been in place during the battle. As with prior iterations, those with farms adjacent to the bridge paid for the replacement. In 1788 these included Captain David Brown, Lieutenant Elisha Jones, and Colonel John Buttrick, all of whom had fought at the North Bridge in 1775.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=29}} In 1793, Concord constructed a new bridge several hundred yards downriver of the North Bridge, making the latter obsolete. The road was diverted to the new bridge and the old road over the North Bridge was abandoned by the town. That same year, the town authorized Elisha Jones to tear down the North Bridge.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=30}} For the next 82 years, no bridge stood at the site.\n\nIn 1874, as plans for the celebration of the centennial of the battle, the Town of Concord appointed a committee to oversee the placement of a monument on the west side of the river where the first minutemen died during the battle. They were also charge with rebuilding the North Bridge.{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=75}} The new structure would not be open to traffic but instead would serve strictly as part of the larger memorial, providing access to the new statue and demonstrating to visitors what the area looked like on the first day of the Revolution. The centennial version of the North Bridge, constructed in 1874, has been described as \"whimsical\" and overly rustic, representing a Victorian era interpretation of what a colonial bridge looked like.{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=76}} The architect was William Ralph Emerson, cousin to Ralph Waldo Emerson, Concord's famed writer and transcendentalist.{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=76}} The most unusual features of the Centennial Bridge were its two pavilions or covered arbors protruding from either side of the center of the bridge covered with interwoven twigs, reminiscent of a Polynesian style.{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=76}}\n\nThe Centennial Bridge was washed away during the spring [[freshet]] of 1888. It was replaced by a more austere bridge that same year. William R. Emerson also designed this bridge but left out the unusual decorative flourishes of his Centennial Bridge. Despite attempts to make the 1888 bridge stronger with large oak pilings and cross beams, it too was washed out by spring floods in 1909.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=58}} The bridge was replaced by the [[Commonwealth of Massachusetts]] in 1909. The architect was Joseph R. Worcester. The bridge had the appearance of historical accuracy in that it closely resembled the bridge as depicted by Doolittle, however many disliked it due to the fact that it was made of concrete.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=58}}\n\n==Existing bridge==\n[[File:Concord Old North Bridge.JPG|thumb|Left to right: the 1836 Battle Monument, the 1956 Old North Bridge (restored in 2005), and \"The Minute Man\" statue by [[Daniel Chester French]] ]]In 1955 the 1909 concrete bridge was damaged beyond repair by flooding due to [[Hurricane Diane]].{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=8}} This took place as the town was considering numerous landscape architectural plans to better preserve the monuments at the site and the surrounding grounds.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=98}} Concord residents mounted protests, urging that the new commemorative bridge should be made of wood and not concrete. Massachusetts politicians including Massachusetts Commissioner of Public Works and future Governor [[John Volpe]] and the current Governor [[Christian Herter]] pressed for funding from Congress but this failed to pass. In 1956 the Commonwealth of Massachusetts undertook construction of a new bridge.{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=122}} \n\nThe state engaged the architectural firm of Whitman and Howard to design the new bridge. Working for that firm, architect Howard Perkins was responsible for drafting the plans. Perkins closely examined the Doolittle drawing and came up with an interpretation based on the drawing. His design featured, according to architectural conservator Judith Q. Sullivan, \"an arched [[pile bridge|pile]] [[Bent Bridge|bent bridge]] consisting of six bents of three piles each.\" Perkins omitted some features evident in the Doolittle design and incorporated others not present for the sake of stability. The most prominent of these added features are the pile header beams which extend on either side of the bridge platform and the cross braces connected to them. These provide strength but also allow flexibility during floods{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=128}} The 1956 bridge used pressure treated wood but incorporated hand hewn timbers for an authentic appearance. The bridge is 109 feet and 8 inches long between [[abutment|abutments]]. Construction was completed in September 1956 and dedicated on September 29, 1956 by Governor Herter.{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=125 and 130}}\n\nIn 1959, the bridge and surrounding land became part of the Minute Man National Historical Park. When the park was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1966, the bridge was listed as \"a contributing structure which illustrates the continuing commemorative importance of the place.\"{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=2}} In 2002, an engineering conditions assessment of the bridge was conducted and found significant deterioration. After further preservation studies, Minute Man National Historical Park embarked on an extensive restoration of the bridge in 2005.\n\n==Monuments placed at the site==\n===1836 Battle Monument===\n[[File: Minute Man National Park, Concord, MA.jpg|thumb|]]\nIn 1835, when there was no bridge at the site, Rev. [[Ezra Ripley]], who resided nearby at the [[Old Manse]], donated a narrow parcel of land to the town. This parcel would allow public access from Monument Street to the proposed site of a monument on the east bank where the Old North Bridge had stood. The parcel included a section of the old Groton Road which once led to the bridge as well as the grave sites of two British soldiers who were killed in the fight and buried nearby the bridge.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=35}} The town of Concord erected the 1836 Battle Monument (as it is now known) with funds donated by the [[Bunker Hill Monument]] Association. The obelisk was designed by Solomon Willard and placed on the land donated by Ripley, near where the east abutment of the bridge had been. The inscription on the monument reads, \"HERE On the 19 of April, 1775, was made the first forcible resistance to British aggression / On the opposite Bank stood the American Militia / Here stood the Invading Army and on this spot the first of the Enemy fell in the War of that Revolution which gave Independence to these United States / In gratitude to GOD and In the love of Freedom this Monument was erected AD. 1836.\"\n\nConcord dedicated the monument on [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]], July 4, 1837. Congressman [[Samuel Hoar]] gave the dedication address. For the occasion, Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote his \"[[Concord Hymn]].\" The first, and best known, of the four stanzas of this poem is:\n\n<poem>::By the rude bridge that arched the flood,\n::Their flag to April's breeze unfurled,\n::Here once the embattled farmers stood\n::And fired the shot heard round the world.</poem>\n\n===\"The Minute Man\" statue===\n\n[[File:Minute Man Statue.jpg|thumb|upright|\"The Minute Man\" by French]]The location of the 1836 Battle Monument did not sit well with some in Concord. Because there was no longer a bridge, the obelisk had been placed on the eastern bank where the British had stood during the Concord Fight. A Concord farmer named Ebenezer Hubbard was particularly annoyed that the spot where the the first Americans had lost their lives during the Concord Fight remained unmarked. Upon his death in 1870, he left the Town of Concord $1,000 to place a monument on the west side of the Concord River and to reconstruct the Old North Bridge to provide access to it. The residents of Concord pressed to finish both the new bridge and monument in time for the centennial celebration in 1875.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=6}}\n\n[[Daniel Chester French]], then 21 years old, was engaged by the Monument Committee to sculpt a statue representing a minuteman. Although commissioned to sculpt a generic provincial soldier, French was inspired by the story of Capt. [[Isaac Davis (soldier)|Isaac Davis]] of [[Acton, Massachusetts]]. Davis commanded the company which led the advance on the Old North Bridge. He was among the first killed and the first American officer killed in action during the Revolution.{{sfnp|Fischer|1994|p=211}} French attempted to model the facial features of his statue after photographs of Isaac Davis's descendants.{{sfnp|Robbins|1945|p=20}}\n\nThe statue was cast from melted down Civil War cannons at the [[Ames Manufacturing Company|Ames Foundry]]. It was French's first public work and was well received. French is best known for his 1920 statue, [[Abraham Lincoln (1920 statue)|\"Abraham Lincoln\"]], in the [[Lincoln Memorial]]. \"The Minute Man\" has been used as the symbol of the [[United States National Guard]] on coins such as the Massachusetts [[50 State quarters|state quarter]].\n\n===Graves of British soldiers===\n[[File:British Soldiers Grave - Old North Bridge.jpg|thumb|1910 marker for the grave of two British soldiers]]Three British soldiers were killed during the Concord Fight. They were Privates James Hall, Thomas Smith and Patrick Gray, all of the [[4th Regiment of Foot]]. One of these men was carried to Concord center, died and was buried there. Two others died at the bridge and were buried adjacent to a stone wall forming the boundary of the Old Manse property. It is not known which of the three are buried at the Old North Bridge site.{{sfnp|Minute Man National Historical Park|2020|}} Initially, their graves were simply marked by two plain stones. [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], who resided at the Old Manse for a time, called these a \"humbler...yet more interesting\" token of the Concord Fight than the 1836 Battle Monument.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=38}}\n\nIn 1875, a granite slab simply inscribed, \"Grave of the British Soldiers\" was installed in time for the centennial.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=6}} In 1910 residents of Concord placed a more substantial granite marker inscribed with a stanza from [[James Russell Lowell|James Russell Lowell's]] 1849 poem, \"Lines, Suggested By the Graves of Two English Soldiers On Concord Battle-Ground:\"\n\n<poem>::They came three thousand miles and died\n::To keep the past upon its throne:\n::Unheard, beyond the ocean tide,\n::Their English Mother made her moan.</poem>\n\n==1975 Bicentennial Commemoration==\nOn the 200th anniversary of the battle, President [[Gerald Ford]] gave a speech at the bridge as part of the [[United States Bicentennial]] celebrations. A crowd of over 15,000 people attended the exercises.{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=132}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite web |last=Dietrich-Smith |first=Deborah |title=Cultural Landscape Report: North Bridge Unit|publisher=Minute Man National Historical Park |date=2003 |url=https://www.nps.gov/mima/learn/management/upload/MIMA%20NB%20CLR%20-%20combined%20.pdfs.pdf |ref=harv }}\n*{{cite book |title=Paul Revere's Ride |last=Fischer|first=David Hackett |authorlink=David Hackett Fischer |year=1994|place=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0195088476 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=u_Ow0uAM3EAC |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |title=The Minute Men: The First Fight: Myths and Realities of the American Revolution|last=Galvin|first=John R.|authorlink= |year=1989|place=Washington |publisher=Pergamon-Brassey's International Defense Publisher |isbn=9780080367330 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cWaE3FzRuH0C|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite web |last=Minute Man National Historical Park |first= |title=North Bridge Questions|publisher=National Park Service |date=2020 |url=https://www.nps.gov/mima/north-bridge-questions.htm |ref=harv }}\n*{{cite book |title=The Story of the Minutemen Man|last=Robbins|first=Roland Wells |authorlink= |year=1945|place=Stoneham, Massachusetts |publisher=George R.

On April 18, 1775, General [[Thomas Gage]], the military Governor of [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]], dispatched a force of roughly 700 British soldiers from [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] to confiscate or destroy military supplies being stockpiled in Concord by the rebellious [[Massachusetts Provincial Congress]].{{sfnp|Galvin|1989|p=99}} On their way to Concord, this force encountered a small group of militia on [[Lexington Battle Green|Lexington Green]]. After a brief skirmish there, the British soldiers marched on to Concord. Soon after reaching the town, [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Francis Smith (British Army officer)|Francis Smith]] sent six [[Company (military unit)|companies]] across the North Bridge to search provincial Colonel [[James Barrett (colonel)|Colonel James Barrett's]] farm for munitions. Three of these companies went on to Barrett's farm while three, totaling roughly 90 men, held the North Bridge. These were the British [[light infantry]] companies from the 4th, 10th, and 43rd Regiments of Foot under [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] Walter Laurie.{{sfnp|Galvin|1989|pp=140-141}} These companies initially held positions on the western side of the bridge but when the provincials advanced, they crossed the bridge and took up a position on the eastern bank.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=26}}\n\nAt about 10:30, the provincials advanced in military order with the intention of taking the bridge and moving on to the center of town to prevent the British from burning the village.{{sfnp|Fischer|1994|p=211}} As they advanced the British fired a few warning shots followed by a full volley. Several provincials were killed or wounded in this first round of firing. Seeing these casualties, Major John Buttrick of Concord, in command of the provincial column, commanded, \"Fire, fellow soldiers, for God's sake fire!\" and the provincials returned fire, causing the British to immediately retreat back to Concord.{{sfnp|Fischer|1994|p=214}} Three British soldiers were killed and nine wounded. On the provincial side two were killed and four wounded.{{sfnp|Minute Man National Historical Park|2020|}}\n\nThis first instance of Americans fighting in military order and firing to deadly effect on British troops was a key turning point in the Battles of Lexington and Concord. It precipitated the British retreat back to Boston and is regarded as one of the most significant events in American history.{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=12}}\n\n==Later iterations of the bridge==\n[[File:The Cambridge book of poetry and song (1882) (14780275725).jpg|thumb|upright|An 1882 drawing of the Centennial Bridge with covered pavilions]]In 1788, a new bridge was constructed to replace the 1760 structure which had been in place during the battle. As with prior iterations, those with farms adjacent to the bridge paid for the replacement. In 1788 these included Captain David Brown, Lieutenant Elisha Jones, and Colonel John Buttrick, all of whom had fought at the North Bridge in 1775.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=29}} In 1793, Concord constructed a new bridge several hundred yards downriver of the North Bridge, making the latter obsolete. The road was diverted to the new bridge and the old road over the North Bridge was abandoned by the town. That same year, the town authorized Elisha Jones to tear down the North Bridge.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=30}} For the next 82 years, no bridge stood at the site.\n\nIn 1874, as plans for the celebration of the centennial of the battle, the Town of Concord appointed a committee to oversee the placement of a monument on the west side of the river where the first minutemen died during the battle. They were also charge with rebuilding the North Bridge.{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=75}} The new structure would not be open to traffic but instead would serve strictly as part of the larger memorial, providing access to the new statue and demonstrating to visitors what the area looked like on the first day of the Revolution. The centennial version of the North Bridge, constructed in 1874, has been described as \"whimsical\" and overly rustic, representing a Victorian era interpretation of what a colonial bridge looked like.{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=76}} The architect was William Ralph Emerson, cousin to Ralph Waldo Emerson, Concord's famed writer and transcendentalist.{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=76}} The most unusual features of the Centennial Bridge were its two pavilions or covered arbors protruding from either side of the center of the bridge covered with interwoven twigs, reminiscent of a Polynesian style.{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=76}}\n\nThe Centennial Bridge was washed away during the spring [[freshet]] of 1888. It was replaced by a more austere bridge that same year. William R. Emerson also designed this bridge but left out the unusual decorative flourishes of his Centennial Bridge. Despite attempts to make the 1888 bridge stronger with large oak pilings and cross beams, it too was washed out by spring floods in 1909.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=58}} The bridge was replaced by the [[Commonwealth of Massachusetts]] in 1909. The architect was Joseph R. Worcester. The bridge had the appearance of historical accuracy in that it closely resembled the bridge as depicted by Doolittle, however many disliked it due to the fact that it was made of concrete.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=58}}\n\n==Existing bridge==\n[[File:Concord Old North Bridge.JPG|thumb|Left to right: the 1836 Battle Monument, the 1956 Old North Bridge (restored in 2005), and \"The Minute Man\" statue by [[Daniel Chester French]] ]]In 1955 the 1909 concrete bridge was damaged beyond repair by flooding due to [[Hurricane Diane]].{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=8}} This took place as the town was considering numerous landscape architectural plans to better preserve the monuments at the site and the surrounding grounds.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=98}} Concord residents mounted protests, urging that the new commemorative bridge should be made of wood and not concrete. Massachusetts politicians including Massachusetts Commissioner of Public Works and future Governor [[John Volpe]] and the current Governor [[Christian Herter]] pressed for funding from Congress but this failed to pass. In 1956 the Commonwealth of Massachusetts undertook construction of a new bridge.{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=122}} \n\nThe state engaged the architectural firm of Whitman and Howard to design the new bridge. Working for that firm, architect Howard Perkins was responsible for drafting the plans. Perkins closely examined the Doolittle drawing and came up with an interpretation based on the drawing. His design featured, according to architectural conservator Judith Q. Sullivan, \"an arched [[pile bridge|pile]] [[Bent bridge|bent bridge]] consisting of six bents of three piles each.\" Perkins omitted some features evident in the Doolittle design and incorporated others not present for the sake of stability. The most prominent of these added features are the pile header beams which extend on either side of the bridge platform and the cross braces connected to them. These provide strength but also allow flexibility during floods{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=128}} The 1956 bridge used pressure treated wood but incorporated hand hewn timbers for an authentic appearance. The bridge is 109 feet and 8 inches long between [[abutment|abutments]]. Construction was completed in September 1956 and dedicated on September 29, 1956 by Governor Herter.{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=125 and 130}}\n\nIn 1959, the bridge and surrounding land became part of the Minute Man National Historical Park. When the park was added to the [[Nation Register of Historic Places]] in 1966, the bridge was listed as \"a contributing structure which illustrates the continuing commemorative importance of the place.\"{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=2}} In 2002, an engineering conditions assessment of the bridge was conducted and found significant deterioration. After further preservation studies, Minute Man National Historical Park embarked on an extensive restoration of the bridge in 2005.\n\n==Monuments placed at the site==\n===1836 Battle Monument===\n[[File: Minute Man National Park, Concord, MA.jpg|thumb|]]\nIn 1835, when there was no bridge at the site, Rev. [[Ezra Ripley]], who resided nearby at the [[Old Manse]], donated a narrow parcel of land to the town. This parcel would allow public access from Monument Street to the proposed site of a monument on the east bank where the Old North Bridge had stood. The parcel included a section of the old Groton Road which once led to the bridge as well as the grave sites of two British soldiers who were killed in the fight and buried nearby the bridge.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=35}} The town of Concord erected the 1836 Battle Monument (as it is now known) with funds donated by the [[Bunker Hill Monument]] Association. The obelisk was designed by Solomon Willard and placed on the land donated by Ripley, near where the east abutment of the bridge had been. The inscription on the monument reads, \"HERE On the 19 of April, 1775, was made the first forcible resistance to British aggression / On the opposite Bank stood the American Militia / Here stood the Invading Army and on this spot the first of the Enemy fell in the War of that Revolution which gave Independence to these United States / In gratitude to GOD and In the love of Freedom this Monument was erected AD. 1836.\"\n\nConcord dedicated the monument on [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]], July 4, 1837. Congressman [[Samuel Hoar]] gave the dedication address. For the occasion, Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote his \"[[Concord Hymn]].\" The first, and best known, of the four stanzas of this poem is:\n\n<poem>::By the rude bridge that arched the flood,\n::Their flag to April's breeze unfurled,\n::Here once the embattled farmers stood\n::And fired the shot heard round the world.</poem>\n\n===\"The Minute Man\" statue===\n\n[[File:Minute Man Statue.jpg|thumb|upright|\"The Minute Man\" by French]]The location of the 1836 Battle Monument did not sit well with some in Concord. Because there was no longer a bridge, the obelisk had been placed on the eastern bank where the British had stood during the Concord Fight. A Concord farmer named Ebenezer Hubbard was particularly annoyed that the spot where the the first Americans had lost their lives during the Concord Fight remained unmarked. Upon his death in 1870, he left the Town of Concord $1,000 to place a monument on the west side of the Concord River and to reconstruct the Old North Bridge to provide access to it. The residents of Concord pressed to finish both the new bridge and monument in time for the centennial celebration in 1875.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=6}}\n\n[[Daniel Chester French]], then 21 years old, was engaged by the Monument Committee to sculpt a statue representing a minuteman. Although commissioned to sculpt a generic provincial soldier, French was inspired by the story of Capt. [[Isaac Davis (soldier)|Isaac Davis]] of [[Acton, Massachusetts]]. Davis commanded the company which led the advance on the Old North Bridge. He was among the first killed and the first American officer killed in action during the Revolution.{{sfnp|Fischer|1994|p=211}} French attempted to model the facial features of his statue after photographs of Isaac Davis's descendants.{{sfnp|Robbins|1945|p=20}}\n\nThe statue was cast from melted down Civil War cannons at the [[Ames Manufacturing Company|Ames Foundry]]. It was French's first public work and was well received. French is best known for his 1920 statue, [[Abraham Lincoln (1920 statue)|\"Abraham Lincoln\"]], in the [[Lincoln Memorial]]. \"The Minute Man\" has been used as the symbol of the [[United States National Guard]] on coins such as the Massachusetts [[50 State quarters|state quarter]].\n\n===Graves of British soldiers===\n[[File:British Soldiers Grave - Old North Bridge.jpg|thumb|1910 marker for the grave of two British soldiers]]Three British soldiers were killed during the Concord Fight. They were Privates James Hall, Thomas Smith and Patrick Gray, all of the [[4th Regiment of Foot]]. One of these men was carried to Concord center, died and was buried there. Two others died at the bridge and were buried adjacent to a stone wall forming the boundary of the Old Manse property. It is not known which of the three are buried at the Old North Bridge site.{{sfnp|Minute Man National Historical Park|2020|}} Initially, their graves were simply marked by two plain stones. [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], who resided at the Old Manse for a time, called these a \"humbler...yet more interesting\" token of the Concord Fight than the 1836 Battle Monument.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=38}}\n\nIn 1875, a granite slab simply inscribed, \"Grave of the British Soldiers\" was installed in time for the centennial.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=6}} In 1910 residents of Concord placed a more substantial granite marker inscribed with a stanza from [[James Russell Lowell|James Russell Lowell's]] 1849 poem, \"Lines, Suggested By the Graves of Two English Soldiers On Concord Battle-Ground:\"\n\n<poem>::They came three thousand miles and died\n::To keep the past upon its throne:\n::Unheard, beyond the ocean tide,\n::Their English Mother made her moan.</poem>\n\n==1975 Bicentennial Commemoration==\nOn the 200th anniversary of the battle, President [[Gerald Ford]] gave a speech at the bridge as part of the [[United States Bicentennial]] celebrations. A crowd of over 15,000 people attended the exercises.{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=132}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite web |last=Dietrich-Smith |first=Deborah |title=Cultural Landscape Report: North Bridge Unit|publisher=Minute Man National Historical Park |date=2003 |url=https://www.nps.gov/mima/learn/management/upload/MIMA%20NB%20CLR%20-%20combined%20.pdfs.pdf |ref=harv }}\n*{{cite book |title=Paul Revere's Ride |last=Fischer|first=David Hackett |authorlink=David Hackett Fischer |year=1994|place=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0195088476 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=u_Ow0uAM3EAC |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |title=The Minute Men: The First Fight: Myths and Realities of the American Revolution|last=Galvin|first=John R.|authorlink= |year=1989|place=Washington |publisher=Pergamon-Brassey's International Defense Publisher |isbn=9780080367330 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cWaE3FzRuH0C|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite web |last=Minute Man National Historical Park |first= |title=North Bridge Questions|publisher=National Park Service |date=2020 |url=https://www.nps.gov/mima/north-bridge-questions.htm |ref=harv }}\n*{{cite book |title=The Story of the Minutemen Man|last=Robbins|first=Roland Wells |authorlink= |year=1945|place=Stoneham, Massachusetts |publisher=George R.

It grossed $140.7&nbsp;million against a budget of $19 million and surpassed ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' (1999) as the highest-grossing R-rated animated film of all time.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nUnbeknownst to humans, a supermarket named Shopwell's is filled with [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] grocery items that believe that the human shoppers are gods, who take groceries they have purchased to a [[utopia]] known as the \"Great Beyond\". Among the groceries in the store is a sausage named Frank, who dreams of living in the Great Beyond with his friends Carl, Barry and his hot dog bun girlfriend Brenda, who he intend upon having intercourse with by putting his sausage in her bun.\n\nFrank and Brenda's packages are purchased by a woman named Camille Toh. On their way out of the supermarket, a returned jar of honey mustard tries to warn the groceries that the Great Beyond is a lie, but nobody listens except Frank. Before [[committing suicide]] by falling onto the shop floor, Honey Mustard tells Frank to seek out a bottle of liquor named Firewater. Honey Mustard's suicide creates an accidental cart collision that causes Frank, Brenda and several groceries to fall out of the cart, including a Jewish [[bagel]] named Sammy Bagel Jr., a Muslim [[lavash]] named Kareem Abdul Lavash (who hate each other) and an aggressive [[douche]] whose nozzle is bent on impact; Douche swears to get revenge against Frank and Brenda.\n\nSeeking to verify Honey Mustard's warning, Frank leads Brenda, Sammy and Lavash to the store's liquor aisle. There, he meets Firewater, with whom he smokes [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] from a kazoo pipe and learns that Firewater and the other non-perishables invented the [[white lie]] of the Great Beyond to assuage the foods' fear of being eaten. Frank vows to reveal the truth to the groceries and is encouraged to travel beyond the store's freezer section for the proof, while Brenda, Sammy and Lavash are brought by a bottle of tequila (who is revealed to be working for Douche) to the Mexican food aisle, until a [[lesbian]] [[Taco shell]] named Teresa del Taco (who is in love with Brenda) helps them escape Douche.\n\nMeanwhile at Camille Toh's house, Carl and Barry are horrified to witness the murder of other purchased foods being cooked and eaten by Camille. Carl is sliced in half by Camille, but Barry manages to escape and encounters a human drug addict who becomes able to communicate with his groceries after injecting himself with [[Bath salts (drug)|bath salts]]. However, the bath salts soon wear off and the addict prepares to cook Barry. The addict accidentally burns himself and Barry yanks his shoelaces, making him slip and causing an axe to fall and decapitate him.\n\nFrank's friends disapprove of his skepticism of the Great Beyond. He discovers a cookbook behind a freezer and reveals its contents to the rest of Shopwell's groceries. The groceries panic and refuse to listen until Barry and the other groceries from the addict's home return with the addict's severed head, proving that the humans are mortal, not gods. Frank, Barry and the others drug the human shoppers and employees with toothpicks laced with bath salts, whereupon an epic battle begins. Several humans are gruesomely killed while Douche takes control of Darren, the store manager. He confronts Frank about becoming a god due to his constant consumption, then takes a bite out of Frank's torso. Brenda saves Frank as Barry and the other foods catch Douche and Darren in a pail strapped to propane tanks. They are then launched out of the store and killed in a massive explosion.\n\nThe groceries celebrate their victory with a store-wide [[orgy]]. Later, they meet Firewater and Gum, a wad of chewing gum resembling [[Stephen Hawking]], who had a [[psychedelic experience]] and discovered that their world is not real; they are merely cartoon characters voiced by famous actors in [[Parallel universes in fiction|another dimension]]. Gum has constructed a portal to this dimension, and the groceries decide to travel there to meet their creators.\n\n==Voice cast==\n<!-- poster billing -->\n* [[Michael Cera]] as Barry, a deformed sausage who is one of Frank's friends.<ref name=ColliderPixarApart /><ref name=ColliderRogenNeighbors /><ref name=\"thewrap-casting\" />\n* [[James Franco]] as the Druggie, an obese drug addict who is the first human to see food as sentient beings after injecting himself with [[Bath salts (drug)|bath salts]].\n* [[Bill Hader]] as Firewater, an old [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] bottle of liquor and the leader of the immortal Non-Perishables.<ref name=ColliderRogenNeighbors />\n* [[Salma Hayek]] as Teresa del Taco, a Mexican [[lesbian]] [[taco]] shell who has a crush on Brenda.<ref name=ColliderRogenNeighbors /><ref name=\"Salma\" />\n* [[Jonah Hill]] as Carl, a sausage who is friends with Frank and Barry.<ref name=ColliderPixarApart /><ref name=\"announces\" /><ref name=ColliderRogenNeighbors />\n* [[Anders Holm]] as Troy, one of the sausages who picks on Barry.\n* [[Nick Kroll]] as [[Douche]], a foulmouthed [[feminine hygiene]] product and Frank's archenemy who seeks revenge on Frank for accidentally breaking his nozzle and preventing him from reaching the \"Great Beyond\".<ref name=ColliderRogenNeighbors /><ref name=\"thewrap-casting\" />\n* [[David Krumholtz]] as Kareem Abdul Lavash, a [[Ethnic groups in the Middle East|Middle-Eastern]] [[lavash]] who has an on-and-off rivalry with Sammy Bagel Jr.<ref name=ColliderPixarApart /><ref name=ColliderRogenNeighbors /><ref name=\"thewrap-casting\" />\n* [[Danny McBride]] as Honey Mustard, a jar of Bickle's [[Honey mustard|Honey Mustard]] who is returned to his Shopwell's shelf upon the shopper mistaking him for regular mustard, and tries to warn Frank and the other products of the reality of the \"Great Beyond\" before committing [[suicide]] by falling onto the store floor.<ref name=\"Rudd-McBride\" />\n* [[Edward Norton]] as Sammy Bagel Jr., a [[Jews|Jewish]] [[bagel]] who has an on-and-off rivalry with Lavash.<ref name=ColliderPixarApart /><ref name=ColliderRogenNeighbors /><ref name=\"thewrap-casting\" />\n* [[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]] as Mr. Grits, an [[African Americans|African-American]] box of grits who is one of the immortal Non-Perishables.

It grossed $140.7&nbsp;million against a budget of $19 million and surpassed ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' (1999) as the highest-grossing R-rated animated film of all time.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nUnbeknownst to humans, a supermarket named Shopwell's is filled with [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] grocery items that believe that the human shoppers are gods, who take groceries they have purchased to a [[utopia]] known as the \"Great Beyond\". Among the groceries in the store is a sausage named Frank, who dreams of living in the Great Beyond with his hot dog bun girlfriend Brenda and his friends Carl and Barry.\n\nFrank and Brenda's packages are purchased by a woman named Camille Toh. On their way out of the supermarket, a returned jar of honey mustard tries to warn the groceries that the Great Beyond is a lie, but nobody listens except Frank. Before [[committing suicide]] by falling onto the shop floor, Honey Mustard tells Frank to seek out a bottle of liquor named Firewater. Honey Mustard's suicide creates an accidental cart collision that causes Frank, Brenda and several groceries to fall out of the cart, including a Jewish [[bagel]] named Sammy Bagel Jr., a Muslim [[lavash]] named Kareem Abdul Lavash (who hate each other) and an aggressive [[douche]] whose nozzle is bent on impact; Douche swears to get revenge against Frank and Brenda.\n\nSeeking to verify Honey Mustard's warning, Frank leads Brenda, Sammy and Lavash to the store's liquor aisle. There, he meets Firewater, with whom he smokes [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] from a kazoo pipe and learns that Firewater and the other non-perishables invented the [[white lie]] of the Great Beyond to assuage the foods' fear of being eaten. Frank vows to reveal the truth to the groceries and is encouraged to travel beyond the store's freezer section for the proof, while Brenda, Sammy and Lavash are brought by a bottle of tequila (who is revealed to be working for Douche) to the Mexican food aisle, until a [[lesbian]] [[Taco shell]] named Teresa del Taco (who is in love with Brenda) helps them escape Douche.\n\nMeanwhile at Camille Toh's house, Carl and Barry are horrified to witness the murder of other purchased foods being cooked and eaten by Camille. Carl is sliced in half by Camille, but Barry manages to escape and encounters a human drug addict who becomes able to communicate with his groceries after injecting himself with [[Bath salts (drug)|bath salts]]. However, the bath salts soon wear off and the addict prepares to cook Barry. The addict accidentally burns himself and Barry yanks his shoelaces, making him slip and causing an axe to fall and decapitate him.\n\nFrank's friends disapprove of his skepticism of the Great Beyond. He discovers a cookbook behind a freezer and reveals its contents to the rest of Shopwell's groceries. The groceries panic and refuse to listen until Barry and the other groceries from the addict's home return with the addict's severed head, proving that the humans are mortal, not gods. Frank, Barry and the others drug the human shoppers and employees with toothpicks laced with bath salts, whereupon an epic battle begins. Several humans are gruesomely killed while Douche takes control of Darren, the store manager. He confronts Frank about becoming a god due to his constant consumption, then takes a bite out of Frank's torso. Brenda saves Frank as Barry and the other foods catch Douche and Darren in a pail strapped to propane tanks. They are then launched out of the store and killed in a massive explosion.\n\nThe groceries celebrate their victory with a store-wide [[orgy]]. Later, they meet Firewater and Gum, a wad of chewing gum resembling [[Stephen Hawking]], who had a [[psychedelic experience]] and discovered that their world is not real; they are merely cartoon characters voiced by famous actors in [[Parallel universes in fiction|another dimension]]. Gum has constructed a portal to this dimension, and the groceries decide to travel there to meet their creators.\n\n==Voice cast==\n<!-- poster billing -->\n* [[Michael Cera]] as Barry, a deformed sausage who is one of Frank's friends.<ref name=ColliderPixarApart /><ref name=ColliderRogenNeighbors /><ref name=\"thewrap-casting\" />\n* [[James Franco]] as the Druggie, an obese drug addict who is the first human to see food as sentient beings after injecting himself with [[Bath salts (drug)|bath salts]].\n* [[Bill Hader]] as Firewater, an old [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] bottle of liquor and the leader of the immortal Non-Perishables.<ref name=ColliderRogenNeighbors />\n* [[Salma Hayek]] as Teresa del Taco, a Mexican [[lesbian]] [[taco]] shell who has a crush on Brenda.<ref name=ColliderRogenNeighbors /><ref name=\"Salma\" />\n* [[Jonah Hill]] as Carl, a sausage who is friends with Frank and Barry.<ref name=ColliderPixarApart /><ref name=\"announces\" /><ref name=ColliderRogenNeighbors />\n* [[Anders Holm]] as Troy, one of the sausages who picks on Barry.\n* [[Nick Kroll]] as [[Douche]], a foulmouthed [[feminine hygiene]] product and Frank's archenemy who seeks revenge on Frank for accidentally breaking his nozzle and preventing him from reaching the \"Great Beyond\".<ref name=ColliderRogenNeighbors /><ref name=\"thewrap-casting\" />\n* [[David Krumholtz]] as Kareem Abdul Lavash, a [[Ethnic groups in the Middle East|Middle-Eastern]] [[lavash]] who has an on-and-off rivalry with Sammy Bagel Jr.<ref name=ColliderPixarApart /><ref name=ColliderRogenNeighbors /><ref name=\"thewrap-casting\" />\n* [[Danny McBride]] as Honey Mustard, a jar of Bickle's [[Honey mustard|Honey Mustard]] who is returned to his Shopwell's shelf upon the shopper mistaking him for regular mustard, and tries to warn Frank and the other products of the reality of the \"Great Beyond\" before committing [[suicide]] by falling onto the store floor.<ref name=\"Rudd-McBride\" />\n* [[Edward Norton]] as Sammy Bagel Jr., a [[Jews|Jewish]] [[bagel]] who has an on-and-off rivalry with Lavash.<ref name=ColliderPixarApart /><ref name=ColliderRogenNeighbors /><ref name=\"thewrap-casting\" />\n* [[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]] as Mr. Grits, an [[African Americans|African-American]] box of grits who is one of the immortal Non-Perishables.
