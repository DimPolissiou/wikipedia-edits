The main dam has an overall length of {{convert|4.8|km|mi|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"hirakud\"/> spanning between two hills; the Laxmidungri on the left and the Chandili Dunguri on the right. The dam is flanked by {{convert|21|km|mi|abbr=on}} of earthen [[Levee|dykes]] on both the left and right sides, closing the low saddles beyond the adjoining hills. The dam and dykes together measure {{convert|25.8|km|mi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"hirakud\"/> It also forms the biggest [[artificial lake]] in [[India]],{{Dubious|date=March 2011}} with a [[reservoir]] holding {{convert|743|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} at full capacity, with a shoreline of over {{convert|639|km|mi|abbr=on}}. There are two observation towers on the dam one at each side. One is \"Gandhi Minar\" and the other one is\"Jawahar Minar\". Both the observation towers present extensive views of the lake.\n\n===Power houses===\nThe dam supports two different [[hydroelectric]] power houses. Power House I is located at the base (toe) of the main dam section and contains 3 x 37.5 MW [[Kaplan turbine]] and 2 x 24 MW Francis turbine generators for an installed capacity of 259.5 MW. Power Station II is located {{convert|19|km|mi|abbr=on}} southeast of the dam {{coord|21|21|10|N|83|55|00|E|name=Chipilima Power House II}} at Chipilima. It contains 3 x 24 MW generators. The entire installed capacity of the dam's power houses is 347.5 MW. [[Power station|Power House]] I and II were built in three stages. During stage I, four generators were installed at PH I and in stage II, the power channel two and Power House II was constructed. All three generators were installed at PH II along with two more at PH I by 1963. Between 1982 and 1990, the seventh and final generator was installed at PH I.<ref name=power>{{cite web|title=Hirakud Power System|url=http://www.ohpcltd.com/hirakud/index.asp?type=prj|publisher=Odisha Hydro Power Corporation|accessdate=3 March 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100913041628/http://www.ohpcltd.com/hirakud/index.asp?type=prj|archivedate=13 September 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Purpose==\n[[File:Hirakud fisherman2.jpg|thumb|right|Fisherman at Hirakud Dam|225px]]\n[[File:Left Hirakud.jpg|thumb|right|Left Dyke of Hirakud Dam|225px]]\n\nIn the upper drainage basin of the Mahanadi River, centered on the [[Chhattisgarh]] Plain, periodic droughts contrast with the situation in the lower delta region where floods may damage crops. The dam was constructed to help alleviate these problems by creating a reservoir and controlling river flow through the drainage system.

Hydroelectricity is also generated. The Hirakud Dam regulates {{convert|83,400|km2|e6acre|abbr=on}} of Mahanadi's drainage. The reservoir has a storage capacity of {{convert|5.818|km3|abbr=on}} with gross of {{convert|8.136|km3|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"hirakud\"/>\n\nIt drains an area of {{convert|133,090|km2|e6acre|abbr=on}}, more than twice the area of [[Sri Lanka]]. The amount of earth, concrete and masonry materials used to build the dam is sufficient to make a road {{convert|8|m|abbr=on}} wide and pave it from [[Kanyakumari district|Kanyakumari]] to [[Kashmir]] and from [[Amritsar]] to [[Dibrugarh]] in [[Assam]].  With successful irrigation provided by the dam, [[Sambalpur district|Sambalpur]] is called the rice bowl of [[Odisha]].\n\nThe project provides {{convert|1556|km2|acre|abbr=on}} of [[kharif]] and {{convert|1084|km2|acre|abbr=on}} of [[Rabi crop|rabi]] irrigation in districts of Sambalpur, [[Bargarh]], [[Bolangir]], and Subarnpur. The water released by the power plant irrigates another {{convert|4360|km2|e6acre|abbr=on}} of [[Culturable command area|CCA]] <!--disambiguate and spell out--> in Mahanadi delta. The dam can generate up to 307.5 MW of electrical power through its two power plants at Burla, on the dam's right bank and Chiplima, {{convert|22|km|abbr=on}} downstream from the dam. In addition, the project provides flood protection to {{convert|9500|km2|e6acre|abbr=on}} of delta area in district of [[Cuttack]] and [[Puri]].\n\nChiplima has gained prominence as the second hydroelectric project of the Hirakud Dam. A natural fall of {{convert|80|to|120|ft|abbr=on}} in the river Mahanadi is used to generate electricity. The place is mostly inhabited by fishermen, whose deity ''Ghanteswari'' is revered in the neighboring area. The state livestock breeding farm and agricultural farm are located here.\n\n==Canal System==\nHirakud Dam has three canals, namely [[Bargarh Main Canal]], Sason Canal and Sambalpur Canal. Bargarh Main canal has a water discharge rate of 4000 cusecs.\n\n==Industrial Use==\nWater from Hirakud Dam at a later stage was allocated to various industries, primarily for mineral processing and coal fired thermal power plants in [[Jharsuguda]] and [[Sambalpur]] districts.<ref>https://infochangeindia.org/water-resources/features/industry-vs-agriculture-the-battle-over-water-in-hirakud.html?Itemid={{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Siltation==\nAs per statistics published by the dam authority, water holding capacity of the dam has been reduced by 28% due to siltation.<ref>http://www.telegraphindia.com/1160809/jsp/frontpage/story_101435.jsp#.V8I5K_l96Hs</ref>\n\n==Water Conflict==\nThe major conflict for water was reported when over 30,000 farmers gathered around the dam making human chain, protesting the allocation of water to the industries and there was no water for the canal system due to low water level.<ref>http://www.downtoearth.org.in/coverage/30000-farmers-demand-hirakud-dam-water--7037</ref>\n\n==Inter-basin Water Transfer==\nThere has been plans for inter-basin water transfer, as per plans of the water resource dept of [[Odisha]] as part of [[India]]'s ambitious [[Indian Rivers Inter-link]].\n\n==Lost temples==\nThese are remnants of temples submerged after the dam was completed in 1957. In the [[summer]] season, the receding water of the dam makes the structures become visible. The hidden treasures have finally caught the attention of historians, and steps are being taken to understand the historical significance of these temples, which periodically go under water, only to resurface again. Many temples have been destroyed after 58 years of underwater existence. However, some remain intact.<ref name=\"timesofindia.indiatimes.com\">http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/City/Bhubaneswar/Temples-resurface-in-Hirakud-bed/articleshow/38304307.cms</ref><ref>http://kddfonline.com/category/agriculture-and-irrigation/hirakud/</ref>\n\nInterest in these lost temples has been rekindled after two stones, etched with writing ('Shila Lekha'), were recovered from what is believed to be the Padmaseni temple of submerged Padmapur village.<ref>http://odishasuntimes.com/65966/ancient-rock-edicts-discovered-odisha/</ref> The temples located inside the reservoir area were part of the then Padmapur, one of the oldest and most populous in the region prior to the dam construction.<ref name=\"timesofindia.indiatimes.com\"/> More than 200 temples were submerged by the dam, nearly 150 temples have either perished or are underwater and about 50 are visible during summer. The lost temples present excellent opportunities for [[scuba diving]] enthusiasts to explore the underbelly of Hirakud Dam. The temple are visible to visitors on boat only during the summer months of May and June.\n\n==Cattle Island==\n\n[[File:Hirakud Island.jpg|thumb|right|One of the many islands within Hirakud Reservoir|225px]]\nCattle Island is located in one of the extreme points of Hirakud Reservoir, a natural wonder. Completely inhabited by wild animals, it is without any trace of humans. It is near Kumarbandh village of Belpahar-Banharpali range which is about {{convert|90|km|abbr=on}} from [[Sambalpur]]. It can be reached by [[launch (boat)|launch]] from Hirakud Dam, it is closer by {{convert|10|km|abbr=on}} via the river. The island is a submerged hill, and before the construction of Hirakud Dam it was a developed village. During the resettlement period, villagers left some of their cattle behind; when the dam construction was over, the cattle settled on the hilltop. With the passage of time the nearby area filled up with the reservoir water, turning the hilltop into an island. Being away from mankind, the cattle are now wild, very swift and not easily caught. Living on a hilltop with dense forest, they are larger than tame cattle, and almost all are white in color. Nearby residents attempt to capture these animals from time to time, but these hunts are rarely successful. Though descended from tame cattle, these animals provide a contrasting picture of this breed of animal returning to life in the wild.<ref>[http://www.bharatonline.com/orissa/sambalpur/excursions.html Cattle Island]</ref>\n\n==Wildlife==\n\nThe dam with the channel provides an ideal environment for the wildlife. The Debrigarh wildlife sanctuary is located here.<ref>[http://debrigarh.org/ Debrigarh wildlife sanctuary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224171759/http://debrigarh.org/ |date=24 December 2010 }}</ref> Several species of migratory birds visit the reservoir during winter.

But, the construction of the dam greatly affected the natives of the western part of Odisha. Nearly 150,000 people were affected by the Hirakud project and nearly 22,000 families were displaced.\n\nIn the original estimate, an amount of {{INRConvert|120|m|year=1956}} was provided for payment of compensation to the affected people. After revision, the amount was reduced to {{INRConvert|95|m|year=1956}} and the total compensation paid to the people was, in reality, only {{INRConvert|33.2|m|year=1956}}. A large number of families were evacuated from their hearth and homes without compensation from 1956 onwards.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120904203542/http://www.merinews.com/catFull.jsp?articleID=136009 Hirakud dam: Displaced families seek rehabilitation ]</ref>\n\n==Stamps and notes==\nA commemorative stamp on Hirakud Dam was released on 29 Oct 1979 by the Department of Posts, with denomination {{INRConvert|0.30}}, 3,000,000 stamps issued.<ref>http://www.indianpost.com/viewstamp.php/Alpha/H/HIRAKUND%20DAM</ref> A hundred rupee note was issued on 26 December 1960 by RBI Governor H.V.R.

The amount of earth, concrete and masonry materials used to build the dam is sufficient to make a road {{convert|8|m|abbr=on}} wide and pave it from [[Kanyakumari district|Kanyakumari]] to [[Kashmir]] and from [[Amritsar]] to [[Dibrugarh]] in [[Assam]].  With successful irrigation provided by the dam, [[Sambalpur district|Sambalpur]] is called the rice bowl of [[Odisha]].\n\nThe project provides {{convert|1556|km2|acre|abbr=on}} of [[kharif]] and {{convert|1084|km2|acre|abbr=on}} of [[Rabi crop|rabi]] irrigation in districts of Sambalpur, [[Bargarh]], [[Bolangir]], and Subarnpur. The water released by the power plant irrigates another {{convert|4360|km2|e6acre|abbr=on}} of [[Culturable command area|CCA]] <!--disambiguate and spell out--> in Mahanadi delta. The dam can generate up to 307.5 MW of electrical power through its two power plants at Burla, on the dam's right bank and Chiplima, {{convert|22|km|abbr=on}} downstream from the dam. In addition, the project provides flood protection to {{convert|9500|km2|e6acre|abbr=on}} of delta area in district of [[Cuttack]] and [[Puri]].\n\nChiplima has gained prominence as the second hydroelectric project of the Hirakud Dam. A natural fall of {{convert|80|to|120|ft|abbr=on}} in the river Mahanadi is used to generate electricity. The place is mostly inhabited by fishermen, whose deity ''Ghanteswari'' is revered in the neighboring area. The state livestock breeding farm and agricultural farm are located here.\n\n==Canal System==\nHirakud Dam has three canals, namely [[Bargarh Main Canal]], Sason Canal and Sambalpur Canal. Bargarh Main canal has a water discharge rate of 4000 cusecs.\n\n==Industrial Use==\nWater from Hirakud Dam at a later stage was allocated to various industries, primarily for mineral processing and coal fired thermal power plants in [[Jharsuguda]] and [[Sambalpur]] districts.<ref>https://infochangeindia.org/water-resources/features/industry-vs-agriculture-the-battle-over-water-in-hirakud.html?Itemid={{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Siltation==\nAs per statistics published by the dam authority, water holding capacity of the dam has been reduced by 28% due to siltation.<ref>http://www.telegraphindia.com/1160809/jsp/frontpage/story_101435.jsp#.V8I5K_l96Hs</ref>\n\n==Water Conflict==\nThe major conflict for water was reported when over 30,000 farmers gathered around the dam making human chain, protesting the allocation of water to the industries and there was no water for the canal system due to low water level.<ref>http://www.downtoearth.org.in/coverage/30000-farmers-demand-hirakud-dam-water--7037</ref>\n\n==Inter-basin Water Transfer==\nThere has been plans for inter-basin water transfer, as per plans of the water resource dept of [[Odisha]] as part of [[India]]'s ambitious [[Indian Rivers Inter-link]].\n\n==Lost temples==\nThese are remnants of temples submerged after the dam was completed in 1957. In the [[summer]] season, the receding water of the dam makes the structures become visible. The hidden treasures have finally caught the attention of historians, and steps are being taken to understand the historical significance of these temples, which periodically go under water, only to resurface again. Many temples have been destroyed after 58 years of underwater existence. However, some remain intact.<ref name=\"timesofindia.indiatimes.com\">http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/City/Bhubaneswar/Temples-resurface-in-Hirakud-bed/articleshow/38304307.cms</ref><ref>http://kddfonline.com/category/agriculture-and-irrigation/hirakud/</ref>\n\nInterest in these lost temples has been rekindled after two stones, etched with writing ('Shila Lekha'), were recovered from what is believed to be the Padmaseni temple of submerged Padmapur village.<ref>http://odishasuntimes.com/65966/ancient-rock-edicts-discovered-odisha/</ref> The temples located inside the reservoir area were part of the then Padmapur, one of the oldest and most populous in the region prior to the dam construction.<ref name=\"timesofindia.indiatimes.com\"/> More than 200 temples were submerged by the dam, nearly 150 temples have either perished or are underwater and about 50 are visible during summer. The lost temples present excellent opportunities for [[scuba diving]] enthusiasts to explore the underbelly of Hirakud Dam. The temple are visible to visitors on boat only during the summer months of May and June.\n\n==Cattle Island==\n\n[[File:Hirakud Island.jpg|thumb|right|One of the many islands within Hirakud Reservoir|225px]]\nCattle Island is located in one of the extreme points of Hirakud Reservoir, a natural wonder. Completely inhabited by wild animals, it is without any trace of humans. It is near Kumarbandh village of Belpahar-Banharpali range which is about {{convert|90|km|abbr=on}} from [[Sambalpur]]. It can be reached by [[launch (boat)|launch]] from Hirakud Dam, it is closer by {{convert|10|km|abbr=on}} via the river. The island is a submerged hill, and before the construction of Hirakud Dam it was a developed village. During the resettlement period, villagers left some of their cattle behind; when the dam construction was over, the cattle settled on the hilltop. With the passage of time the nearby area filled up with the reservoir water, turning the hilltop into an island. Being away from mankind, the cattle are now wild, very swift and not easily caught. Living on a hilltop with dense forest, they are larger than tame cattle, and almost all are white in color. Nearby residents attempt to capture these animals from time to time, but these hunts are rarely successful. Though descended from tame cattle, these animals provide a contrasting picture of this breed of animal returning to life in the wild.<ref>[http://www.bharatonline.com/orissa/sambalpur/excursions.html Cattle Island]</ref>\n\n==Wildlife==\n\nThe dam with the channel provides an ideal environment for the wildlife. The Debrigarh wildlife sanctuary is located here.<ref>[http://debrigarh.org/ Debrigarh wildlife sanctuary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224171759/http://debrigarh.org/ |date=24 December 2010 }}</ref> Several species of migratory birds visit the reservoir during winter. Nearly 20-25 species of birds are seen in the reservoir and common among them are [[common pochard]], [[red-crested pochard]], [[great crested grebe]] and several others.<ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Winged+guests+flock+to+Hirakud.-a0220689416 Migratory birds in Hirakud]</ref>\n\n==People affected by the dam construction==\nThe main purpose of the Hirakud Dam was to check the massive floods that were affecting a large part of coastal Odisha. But, the construction of the dam greatly affected the natives of the western part of Odisha. Nearly 150,000 people were affected by the Hirakud project and nearly 22,000 families were displaced.\n\nIn the original estimate, an amount of {{INRConvert|120|m|year=1956}} was provided for payment of compensation to the affected people. After revision, the amount was reduced to {{INRConvert|95|m|year=1956}} and the total compensation paid to the people was, in reality, only {{INRConvert|33.2|m|year=1956}}. A large number of families were evacuated from their hearth and homes without compensation from 1956 onwards.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120904203542/http://www.merinews.com/catFull.jsp?articleID=136009 Hirakud dam: Displaced families seek rehabilitation ]</ref>\n\n==Stamps and notes==\nA commemorative stamp on Hirakud Dam was released on 29 Oct 1979 by the Department of Posts, with denomination {{INRConvert|0.30}}, 3,000,000 stamps issued.<ref>http://www.indianpost.com/viewstamp.php/Alpha/H/HIRAKUND%20DAM</ref> A hundred rupee note was issued on 26 December 1960 by RBI Governor H.V.R.

Prior to India's independence from the British, Himachal comprised the hilly regions of [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab Province]] of [[British India]]. After independence, many of the hilly territories were organized as the Chief Commissioner's province of Himachal Pradesh which later became a union territory. In 1966, hilly areas of neighboring [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] state were merged into Himachal and it was ultimately granted full statehood in 1971.\n\nHimachal Pradesh is spread across valleys with many perennial rivers flowing through them. Almost 90% of the state's population lives in rural areas. Agriculture, horticulture, hydropower and tourism are important constituents of the state's economy. The hilly state is almost universally electrified with 99.5% of the households having [[List of states and union territories of India by households having electricity|electricity]] as of 2016.

Prior to India's independence from the British, Himachal comprised the hilly regions of [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab Province]] of [[British India]]. After independence, many of the hilly territories were organized as the Chief Commissioner's province of Himachal Pradesh which later became a union territory. In 1966, hilly areas of neighboring [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] state were merged into Himachal and it was ultimately granted full statehood in 1971.\n\nHimachal Pradesh is spread across valleys with many perennial rivers flowing through them. Almost 90% of the state's population lives in rural areas. Agriculture, horticulture, hydropower and tourism are important constituents of the state's economy.
