Light blue marks new members.]]\n\n[[NATO]] (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) is an international alliance that consists of 30 [[member states]] from [[North America]] and [[Europe]]. It was established at the signing of the [[North Atlantic Treaty]] on 4 April 1949. [[North Atlantic Treaty#Article 5|Article Five]] of the treaty states that if an armed attack occurs against one of the member states, it shall be [[Collective defense|considered an attack against all members]], and other members shall assist the attacked member, with [[armed forces]] if necessary.<ref>{{cite web|title=The North Atlantic Treaty|url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/faq.htm|publisher=North Atlantic Treaty Organization|date=1949-04-04|accessdate=2008-06-16}}</ref>\n\nOf the 30 member countries, two are located in [[North America]] ([[Canada]] and the [[United States]]), 28 are in [[Europe]], one of which ([[Turkey]]) is in both Europe and [[Asia]] . All members have militaries, except for [[Iceland]] which does not have a typical army (but does, however, have a [[coast guard]] and a small unit of civilian specialists for NATO operations). Three of NATO's members are [[List of states with nuclear weapons|nuclear weapons states]]: [[France]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]]. NATO has 12 original founding member nation states, and from 18 February 1952 to 6 May 1955, it added three more member nations, and a fourth on 30 May 1982. After the end of the [[Cold War]], NATO added 14 more member nations (10 former [[Warsaw Pact]] members and four former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] republics) from 12 March 1999 to 27 March 2020.\n\n==Founding and changes in membership==\n{{main article|Enlargement of NATO}}\nNATO has added new members eight times since its foundation, in 1949, with a total of 30 members. Twelve countries took part in the founding of NATO: [[Belgium]], [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Iceland]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]], [[the Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Portugal]], [[the United Kingdom]], and [[the United States]]. In 1952, Greece and Turkey became members of the Alliance, joined later by [[West Germany]] (in 1955) and [[Spain]] (in 1982). In 1990, with the [[German reunification|reunification of Germany]], NATO grew to include the former country of [[East Germany]]. Between 1994 and 1997, wider forums for regional cooperation between NATO and its neighbors were set up, including the [[Partnership for Peace]], the [[Mediterranean Dialogue]] initiative and the [[Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council]]. In 1997, three former [[Warsaw Pact]] countries, [[Hungary]], the [[Czech Republic]], and [[Poland]], were invited to join NATO. After this fourth enlargement in 1999, the [[Vilnius group]] of the Baltics and seven East European countries formed in May 2000 to cooperate and lobby for further NATO membership. Seven of these countries joined in the fifth enlargement in 2004. The [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] States [[Albania]] and [[Croatia]] joined in the sixth enlargement in 2009, [[Montenegro]] in 2017 and [[North Macedonia]] in 2020. \n\nUnited States President [[Donald Trump]] expressed interest in withdrawing from the organization during [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|his 2016 presidential campaign]], but he later stated that the United States would protect allies in the event that Article V is invoked.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20170518-white-house-official-trump-threatens-leave-nato-usa-g7-russia|title=Trump threatens to quit NATO: White House official  - France 24|date=2017-05-18|work=France 24|access-date=2017-05-31|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/25/world/europe/donald-trump-eu-nato.html|title=In NATO Speech, Trump Is Vague About Mutual Defense Pledge|last=Landler|first=Michael D.

It was established at the signing of the [[North Atlantic Treaty]] on 4 April 1949. [[North Atlantic Treaty#Article 5|Article Five]] of the treaty states that if an armed attack occurs against one of the member states, it shall be [[Collective defense|considered an attack against all members]], and other members shall assist the attacked member, with [[armed forces]] if necessary.<ref>{{cite web|title=The North Atlantic Treaty|url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/faq.htm|publisher=North Atlantic Treaty Organization|date=1949-04-04|accessdate=2008-06-16}}</ref>\n\nOf the 30 member countries, two are located in [[North America]] ([[Canada]] and the [[United States]]), 28 are in [[Europe]], one of which is in [[Europe]] and [[Asia]] ([[Turkey]]). All members have militaries, except for [[Iceland]] which does not have a typical army (but does, however, have a [[coast guard]] and a small unit of civilian specialists for NATO operations). Three of NATO's members are [[List of states with nuclear weapons|nuclear weapons states]]: [[France]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]]. NATO has 12 original founding member nation states, and from 18 February 1952 to 6 May 1955, it added three more member nations, and a fourth on 30 May 1982. After the end of the [[Cold War]], NATO added 14 more member nations (10 former [[Warsaw Pact]] members and four former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] republics) from 12 March 1999 to 27 March 2020.\n\n==Founding and changes in membership==\n{{main article|Enlargement of NATO}}\nNATO has added new members eight times since its foundation, in 1949, with a total of 30 members. Twelve countries took part in the founding of NATO: [[Belgium]], [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Iceland]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]], [[the Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Portugal]], [[the United Kingdom]], and [[the United States]]. In 1952, Greece and Turkey became members of the Alliance, joined later by [[West Germany]] (in 1955) and [[Spain]] (in 1982). In 1990, with the [[German reunification|reunification of Germany]], NATO grew to include the former country of [[East Germany]]. Between 1994 and 1997, wider forums for regional cooperation between NATO and its neighbors were set up, including the [[Partnership for Peace]], the [[Mediterranean Dialogue]] initiative and the [[Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council]]. In 1997, three former [[Warsaw Pact]] countries, [[Hungary]], the [[Czech Republic]], and [[Poland]], were invited to join NATO. After this fourth enlargement in 1999, the [[Vilnius group]] of the Baltics and seven East European countries formed in May 2000 to cooperate and lobby for further NATO membership. Seven of these countries joined in the fifth enlargement in 2004. The [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] States [[Albania]] and [[Croatia]] joined in the sixth enlargement in 2009, [[Montenegro]] in 2017 and [[North Macedonia]] in 2020. \n\nUnited States President [[Donald Trump]] expressed interest in withdrawing from the organization during [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|his 2016 presidential campaign]], but he later stated that the United States would protect allies in the event that Article V is invoked.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20170518-white-house-official-trump-threatens-leave-nato-usa-g7-russia|title=Trump threatens to quit NATO: White House official  - France 24|date=2017-05-18|work=France 24|access-date=2017-05-31|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/25/world/europe/donald-trump-eu-nato.html|title=In NATO Speech, Trump Is Vague About Mutual Defense Pledge|last=Landler|first=Michael D.

This work is written at a relatively advanced level as Theon tends to shorten Euclid's proofs rather than amplify them.<ref name=\"mactutor\"/> \n*''Commentary on the [[Euclid's Optics|Optics]]'' of Euclid. This elementary-level work is believed to consist of lecture notes compiled by a student of Theon.<ref name=\"mactutor\"/>\n*''Commentary on the [[Almagest]]''. Originally a commentary on all thirteen books of Ptolemy's ''Almagest'', but now missing book 11 and most of book 5. The commentary is a reworking of Theon's own lecture notes, and is useful chiefly for including information from lost works by writers such as [[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus]].<ref name=\"mcmahon\">John M. McMahon, \"Theon of Alexandria\" entry in Virginia Trimble, Thomas Williams, Katherine Bracher (2007), ''Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers'', pages 1133-4. Springer</ref> It is also useful for Theon's account of the Greek method of operating with the [[sexagesimal]] system as it was applied to calculations.<ref name=\"mactutor\"/> \n*''Great Commentary'' on Ptolemy's ''Handy Tables''. This work partially survives. It originally consisted of 5 books, of which books 1&ndash;3 and the beginning of book 4 are extant. It describes how to use Ptolemy's tables and gives details on the reasoning behind the calculations.<ref name=\"mcmahon\"/>\n*''Little Commentary'' on Ptolemy's ''Handy Tables''. This work survives complete. It consists of one book and is intended as a primer for students.<ref name=\"mcmahon\"/> In this work Theon mentions that certain (unnamed) ancient astrologers believed that the [[precession of the equinoxes]], rather than being a steady unending motion, instead reverses direction every 640 years, and that the last reversal had been in 158 BC.<ref name=\"evans276\">James Evans, (1998), ''The History and Practice of Ancient Astronomy'', page 276. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-509539-1}}</ref> Theon describes but did not endorse this theory. This idea inspired [[Th\u0101bit ibn Qurra]] in the 9th century to create the theory of [[trepidation]] to explain a variation which he (incorrectly) believed was affecting the rate of precession.<ref name=\"evans276\"/>\n*''Commentary on Aratus''. Some extant ''[[scholia]]'' on the ''Phaenomena'' of [[Aratus]] are attributed doubtfully to Theon.<ref name=\"smith\"/>\n\n=== Original works ===\n*''Treatise on the Astrolabe''. Both the ''[[Suda]]'' and Arabic sources attribute to Theon a work on the [[astrolabe]]. This work has not survived, but it may have been the first ever treatise on the astrolabe, and it was important in transmitting Greek knowledge on this instrument to later ages. The extant treatises on the astrolabe by the 6th century Greek scholar [[John Philoponus]] and by the 7th century Syriac scholar [[Severus Sebokht]] draw heavily on Theon's work.<ref name=\"evans156\">James Evans, (1998), ''The History and Practice of Ancient Astronomy'', page 156.

Could you help us with a loan?\" or \"For you to be a party to the transaction, you must have holdings at a Nigerian bank of $100,000 or more\" or similar. This is the money being stolen from the victim; the victim willingly transfers the money, usually through some irreversible channel such as a [[wire transfer]], and the scammer receives and pockets it.<ref name=\"usembassy\"/>\n\nMore delays and additional costs are added, always keeping the promise of an imminent large transfer alive, convincing the victim that the money the victim is currently paying is covered several times over by the payoff. The implication that these payments will be used for \"white-collar\" crime such as bribery, and even that the money they are being promised is being stolen from a government or royal/wealthy family, often prevents the victim from telling others about the \"transaction\", as it would involve admitting that they intended to be complicit in an international crime.<ref name=\"usembassy\"/>\n\nSometimes psychological pressure is added by claiming that the Nigerian side, to pay certain fees, had to sell belongings and borrow money on a house, or by comparing the salary scale and living conditions in Africa to those in the West. Much of the time, however, the needed psychological pressure is self-applied; once the victims have provided money toward the payoff, they feel they have a vested interest in seeing the \"deal\" through. Some victims even believe they can cheat the other party, and walk away with all the money instead of just the percentage they were promised.<ref name=\"usembassy\"/>\n\nThe essential fact in all advance-fee fraud operations is the promised money transfer to the victim never happens, because the money does not exist. The perpetrators rely on the fact that, by the time the victim realizes this (often only after being confronted by a third party who has noticed the transactions or conversation and recognized the scam), the victim may have sent thousands of dollars of their own money, and sometimes thousands more that has been borrowed or stolen, to the scammer via an untraceable and/or irreversible means such as wire transfer.<ref name=\"usembassy\"/> The scammer disappears, and the victim is left on the hook for the money sent to the scammer.\n\nDuring the course of many schemes, scammers ask victims to supply bank account information. Usually this is a \"test\" devised by the scammer to gauge the victim's [[gullibility]];<ref name=\"Netherlands\"/> the bank account information isn't used directly by the scammer, because a fraudulent withdrawal from the account is more easily detected, reversed, and traced. Scammers instead usually request that payments be made using a wire transfer service like [[Western Union]] and [[MoneyGram]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Advance Fee Loan Scams {{!}} DirectLendingSolutions.com\u00ae|url = https://www.directlendingsolutions.com/loan_scam.htm|website = www.directlendingsolutions.com|accessdate = 2015-09-24}}</ref> The reason given by the scammer usually relates to the speed at which the payment can be received and processed, allowing quick release of the supposed payoff. The real reason is that wire transfers and similar methods of payment are irreversible, untraceable and, because identification beyond knowledge of the details of the transaction is often not required, completely anonymous.<ref name=\"usembassy\"/> However, bank account information obtained by scammers is sometimes sold in bulk to other fraudsters, who wait a few months for the victim to repair the damage caused by the initial scam, before raiding any accounts which the victim didn't close.\n\nTelephone numbers used by scammers tend to come from [[burner phones]]. In [[Ivory Coast]] a scammer may purchase an inexpensive mobile phone and a pre-paid SIM card without submitting any identifying information. If the scammers believe they are being traced, they discard their mobile phones and purchase new ones.<ref name=\"usembassy\"/>\n\nThe spam emails used in these scams are often sent from [[Internet caf\u00e9]]s equipped with satellite internet connection. Recipient addresses and email content are copied and pasted into a webmail interface using a stand-alone storage medium, such as a memory card. Certain areas of [[Lagos]], such as [[Festac]], contain many cyber caf\u00e9s that serve scammers; cyber caf\u00e9s often seal their doors outside hours, such as from 10:30pm to 7:00am, so that scammers inside may work without fear of discovery.<ref name=\"eat\">{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/latimests/20051020/ts_latimes/iwilleatyourdollars |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |date=2005-10-29 |accessdate=2012-02-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051029165224/http://news.yahoo.com/s/latimests/20051020/ts_latimes/iwilleatyourdollars |archivedate=October 29, 2005 }}</ref>\n\nNigeria also contains many businesses that provide false documents used in scams; after a scam involving a forged signature of Nigerian President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] in summer 2005, Nigerian authorities raided a market in the Oluwole section of Lagos. The police seized thousands of Nigerian and non-Nigerian passports, 10,000 blank [[British Airways]] boarding passes, 10,000 United States Postal [[money order]]s, customs documents, false university certificates, 500 printing plates, and 500 computers.<ref name=\"eat\"/>\n\nThe \"success rate\" of the scammers is also hard to gauge, since they are operating illegally and do not keep track of specific numbers. One individual estimated he sent 500 emails per day and received about seven replies, citing that when he received a reply, he was 70 percent certain he would get the money.<ref name=\"Dixon_Robyn\"/> If tens of thousands of emails are sent every day by thousands of individuals, it doesn't take a very high success rate to be worthwhile.<ref name=\"Grinker_Roy\">{{cite book|author1=Grinker, Roy R. |author2=Lubkemann, Stephen C. |author3=Steiner, Christopher B. |title=Perspectives on Africa: A Reader in Culture, History and Representation|year=2010|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=[[New York City]]|isbn=978-1-4443-3522-4|pages=618\u2013621|url=https://books.google.com/?id=myLOFYZ4dQ0C&pg=PA621&lpg=PA621&dq=nigerian+scam+success+rate#v=onepage&q=nigerian%20scam%20success%20rate&f=false}}</ref>\n\n==Countermeasures==\n[[File:Firefox 2.0.0.1 Phising Alert.png|thumb|Screenshot of a suspicious site warning in the [[Firefox]] browser<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/2.0.0.1/releasenotes/ |title=Firefox Release Notes|publisher=Mozilla|accessdate=14 September 2010}}</ref>]]\nIn recent years, efforts have been made by governments, internet companies, and individuals to combat scammers involved in advance-fee fraud and 419 scams. In 2004, the Nigerian government formed the [[Economic and Financial Crimes Commission]] (EFCC) to combat economic and financial crimes, such as advanced fee fraud.<ref name=\"EFCC\">{{cite web|title=Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (Establishment) Act of 2004 |url=http://www.efccnigeria.org/efcc_homepage_files/establishment_act_2004.pdf |publisher=Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (Nigeria) |accessdate=June 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628080831/http://www.efccnigeria.org/efcc_homepage_files/establishment_act_2004.pdf |archivedate=June 28, 2012 }}</ref> In 2009, Nigeria's EFCC announced that they have adopted smart technology developed by [[Microsoft]] to track down fraudulent emails. They hoped to have the service, dubbed \"Eagle Claw\", running at full capacity to warn a quarter of a million potential victims.<ref name=\"AFP_2009\"/>\n\nSome individuals participate in a practice known as [[scam baiting]], in which they pose as potential targets and engage the scammers in lengthy dialogue so as to waste the scammer's time and decrease the time they have available for real victims.<ref name=\"Cheng_Jacqui\">{{cite news|last=Cheng|first=Jacqui|title=Baiting Nigerian scammers for fun (not so much for profit).|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2009/05/baiting-nigerian-scammers-for-fun-not-so-much-for-profit/|accessdate=June 22, 2012|newspaper=[[Ars Technica]]|date=May 11, 2009}}</ref> Details on the practice of scam baiting, and ideas, are chronicled on a website, [[419eater.com]], launched in 2003 by Michael Berry. One particularly notable case of scam baiting involved an American who identified himself to a Nigerian scammer as [[James T. Kirk]]. When the scammer \u2014 who apparently had never heard of the television series ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' \u2014 asked for his passport details, \"Kirk\" sent a copy of a fake passport with a photo of ''Star Trek''{{'}}s Captain Kirk, hoping the scammer would attempt to use it and get arrested.<ref name=\"Corbin_Jane\">{{cite news|last=Corbin|first=Jane|title=A mysterious email and a split-second mistake: That's all it took for internet gangsters to hijack my life...|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1243634/A-mysterious-email-split-second-mistake-Thats-took-internet-gangsters-hijack-life-.html|accessdate=June 22, 2012|newspaper=[[Daily Mail]]|date=January 15, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Common elements==\n===Irreversible money transfers===\nA central element of advance-fee fraud is the transaction from the victim to the scammer must be untraceable and irreversible. Otherwise, the victim, once they become aware of the scam, can successfully retrieve their money and alert officials who can track the accounts used by the scammer.\n\nWire transfers via [[Western Union]] and [[MoneyGram]] are ideal for this purpose. International wire transfers cannot be cancelled or reversed, and the person receiving the money cannot be tracked. Other non-cancellable forms of payment include postal money orders and cashier's checks, but wire transfer via Western Union or MoneyGram is more common. [[Cryptocurrency]] payments are also used.\n\n===Anonymous communication===\nSince the scammer's operations must be untraceable to avoid identification, and because the scammer is often impersonating someone else, any communication between the scammer and his victim must be done through channels that hide the scammer's true identity. The following options in particular are widely used.\n\n====Web-based email====\nBecause many free email services do not require valid identifying information, and also allow communication with many victims in a short span of time, they are the preferred method of communication for scammers. Some services go so far as to mask the sender's source IP address ([[Gmail]] being a common choice), making the scammer more difficult to trace to the country of origin. While Gmail does indeed strip headers from emails, it is, in fact, possible to trace an IP address from such an email. Scammers can create as many accounts as they wish, and often have several at a time. In addition, if email providers are alerted to the scammer's activities and suspend the account, it is a trivial matter for the scammer to simply create a new account to resume scamming.\n\n====Email hijacking/friend scams====\nSome fraudsters hijack existing email accounts and use them for advance-fee fraud purposes. The fraudster impersonates associates, friends, or family members of the legitimate account owner in an attempt to defraud them.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gallagher|first=David F.|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/09/e-mail-scammers-ask-your-friends-for-money/index.html?ex=1352264400&en=597277d1a0cbde58&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss|title=E-Mail Scammers Ask Your Friends for Money|publisher=Bits.blogs.nytimes.com|date=2007-11-09|accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref> A variety of techniques such as [[phishing]], [[Keystroke logging|keyloggers]], and [[computer virus]]es are used to gain login information for the email address.\n\n====Fax transmissions====\n[[Fax|Facsimile machines]] are commonly used tools of business, whenever a client requires a hard copy of a document. They can also be simulated using web services, and made untraceable by the use of prepaid phones connected to mobile fax machines or by use of a public fax machine such as one owned by a document processing business like [[FedEx Office|FedEx Office/Kinko's]]. Thus, scammers posing as business entities often use fax transmissions as an anonymous form of communication. This is more expensive, as the prepaid phone and fax equipment cost more than email, but to a skeptical victim, it can be more believable.\n\n====SMS messages====\nAbusing [[Short Message Service|SMS]] bulk senders such as [[Wireless Application Service Provider|WASPs]], scammers subscribe to these services using fraudulent registration details and paying either via cash or stolen credit card details. They then send out masses of unsolicited SMSes to victims stating they have won a competition, lottery, reward, or an event, and they have to contact somebody to claim their prize. Typically the details of the party to be contacted will be an equally untraceable email address or a [[virtual telephone number]]. \n\nThese messages may be sent over a weekend when the staff at the service providers are not working, enabling the scammer to be able to abuse the services for a whole weekend. Even when traceable, they give out long and winding procedures for procuring the reward (real or unreal) and that too with the impending huge cost of transportation and tax or duty charges. The origin of such SMS messages is often from fake websites/addresses.\n\nA recent (mid-2011) innovation is the use of a Premium Rate 'call back' number (instead of a website or email) in the SMS. On calling the number, the victim is first reassured that 'they are a winner' and then subjected to a long series of instructions on how to collect their 'winnings'. During the message, there will be frequent instructions to 'ring back in the event of problems'. The call is always 'cut off' just before the victim has the chance to note all the details. Some victims call back multiple times in an effort to collect all the details. The scammer thus makes their money out of the fees charged for the calls.\n\n====Telecommunications relay services====\nMany scams use telephone calls to convince the victim that the person on the other end of the deal is a real, truthful person. The scammer, possibly impersonating a person of a nationality, or gender, other than their own, would arouse suspicion by telephoning the victim. In these cases, scammers use [[Telecommunications Relay Service|TRS]], a US federally funded relay service where an operator or a text/speech translation program acts as an intermediary between someone using an ordinary telephone and a deaf caller using [[telecommunications device for the deaf|TDD]] or other [[teleprinter]] device. The scammer may claim they are deaf, and that they must use a relay service. The victim, possibly drawn in by sympathy for a disabled caller, might be more susceptible to the fraud.\n\nFCC regulations and confidentiality laws require operators to relay calls verbatim and adhere to a strict code of confidentiality and ethics. Thus, no relay operator may judge the legality and legitimacy of a relay call and must relay it without interference. This means the relay operator may not warn victims, even when they suspect the call is a scam. [[MCI Inc.|MCI]] said about one percent of their IP Relay calls in 2004 were scams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msnbc.msn.com/ID/4781806|title=Con artists target phone system for deaf|publisher=MSNBC|date=2004-04-20|accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref>\n\nTracking phone-based relay services is relatively easy, so scammers tend to prefer Internet Protocol-based relay services such as [[IP Relay]]. In a common strategy, they bind their overseas IP address to a router or server located on US soil, allowing them to use US-based relay service providers without interference.\n\nTRS is sometimes used to relay credit card information to make a fraudulent purchase with a stolen credit card. In many cases however, it is simply a means for the con artist to further lure the victim into the scam.\n\n===Invitation to visit the country===\nSometimes, victims are invited to a country to meet government officials, an associate of the scammer, or the scammer themselves. Some victims who travel are instead held for ransom. Scammers may tell a victim that they do not need  a [[visa (document)|visa]], or that the scammers will provide one.<ref name=\"StateDeptPub10465\">{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/2189.pdf |author=United States Department of State |title=Nigerian Advance Fee Fraud (DEPARTMENT OF STATE PUBLICATION 10465) |date=April 1997 |access-date=January 4, 2019 |publisher=State Dept.

Some of the more commonly seen variants involve [[employment scams]], [[lottery scam]]s, online sales and rentals, and [[romance scam]]s. Many scams involve online sales, such as those advertised on websites such as [[Craigslist]] and [[eBay]], or property rental. This article cannot list every known and future type of advanced fee fraud or 419 scheme; only some major types are described. Additional examples may be available in the ''[[#External links|external links]]'' section at the end of this article.\n\n===Employment scams===\nThis scam targets people who have posted their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s on e.g. job sites. The scammer sends a letter with a falsified company logo. The job offer usually indicates exceptional salary and benefits, and requests that the victim needs a \"work permit\" for working in the country, and includes the address of a (fake) \"government official\" to contact. The \"government official\" then proceeds to fleece the victim by extracting fees from the unsuspecting user for the work permit and other fees. A variant of the job scam recruits freelancers seeking work, such as editing or translation, then requires some advance payment before assignments are offered.\n\nMany legitimate (or at least fully registered) companies work on a similar basis, using this method as their primary source of earnings. Some modelling and escort agencies tell applicants that they have a number of clients lined up, but that they require some sort of prior \"registration fee\", usually paid in by an untraceable method, e.g. by Western Union transfer; once the fee is paid, the applicant is informed the client has cancelled, and not contacted again.\n\nThe scammer contacts the victim to interest them in a \"work-at-home\" opportunity, or asks them to cash a check or money order that for some reason cannot be redeemed locally. In one cover story, the perpetrator of the scam wishes the victim to work as a \"mystery shopper\", evaluating the service provided by MoneyGram or Western Union locations within major retailers such as [[Wal-Mart]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc5i.com/newsbycounty/14519865/detail.html|title=Denton Woman Says Mystery Shopper Job Was Scam|publisher=Nbc5i.com|date=November 6, 2007|accessdate=2009-06-10|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927013037/http://www.nbc5i.com/newsbycounty/14519865/detail.html|archivedate=2008-09-27}}</ref> The scammer sends the victim a forged or stolen check or money order [[#Fake checks|as described above]], the victim deposits it\u2014banks will often credit an account with the value of a check not obviously false\u2014 and sends the money to the scammer via wire transfer. Later the check is not honoured and the bank debits the victim's account. Schemes based solely on check cashing usually offer only a small part of the check's total amount, with the assurance that many more checks will follow; if the victim buys into the scam and cashes all the checks, the scammer can steal a lot in a very short time.\n\n====Bogus job offers====\nMore sophisticated scams advertise jobs with real companies and offer lucrative salaries and conditions with the fraudsters pretending to be recruitment agents. A bogus telephone or online interview may take place and after some time the applicant is informed that the job is theirs. To secure the job they are instructed to send money for their work visa or travel costs to the agent, or to a bogus travel agent who works on the scammer's behalf. No matter what the variation, they always involve the job seeker sending them or their agent money, credit card or bank account details.<ref name=\"Adams\">{{cite news|last1=Adams|first1=Tony|title=Columbus woman warns others to beware of job phishing scams.|url=http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/business/article136738313.html|accessdate=March 23, 2017|publisher=Ledger-Enquirer|date=March 6, 2017}}</ref> A newer form of employment scam has arisen in which users are sent a bogus job offer, but are not asked to give financial information. Instead, their personal information is harvested during the application process and then sold to third parties for a profit, or used for [[identity theft]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/09/AR2007020901925.html|title=Taking the Bait On a Phish Scam, Job Seekers Are Targets, Victims of Sophisticated Ploy|last=Shin|first=Annys|date=2007-10-02|newspaper=Washington Post|accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/11/business/fi-monster11|title=Sleeping on the job?

The attendees are then made to assist to a conference where a scammer will use elaborate manipulation techniques to convince the attendees to purchase products, in a similar manner to the catalog merchant business model, as a hiring requisite. Quite often, the company lacks any form of the physical catalog to help them sell products (e.g. jewelry). When \"given\" the job, the individual is then asked to promote the scam job offer on their own. They are also made to work the company unpaid as a form of \"training\".<ref name=\"Lee\">{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Diane|title=Upstate company posts salaried job ads, but isn't hiring for real positions say fmr. employees.|url=http://wspa.com/2017/02/23/upstate-company-posts-salaried-job-ads-but-isnt-hiring-real-for-positions-say-fmr-employees/|accessdate=March 23, 2017|publisher=[[WSPA-TV]]|date=February 23, 2017}}</ref> Similar scams involve making alleged job candidates pay money upfront in person for training materials or services, with the claim that upon successful completion, they will be offered a guaranteed job, which never materializes.<ref name=\"Kliot\">{{cite news|last1=Kliot|first1=Hannah|title=Online employment scams target college students.|url=http://www.ksat.com/education/college-students-targeted-by-online-employment-scams|accessdate=March 23, 2017|publisher=[[KSAT-TV]]|date=January 31, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Cash-handling scam====\nThese scammers do internet searches on various companies to obtain hiring managers' names. They then advertise job offers on Job Search sites. The job hunter will then apply for the position with a resume. The person applying for the position will get a message almost instantly from a common email account such as \"Yahoo\", asking for credentials. The scammer will sometimes request that the victim has an \"Instant Messenger\" chat to obtain more information. The scammer guarantees employment, usually through automated computer programs that have a certain algorithm, with \"canned responses\" in broken English.\n\nAt the \"Instant Messenger\" stage, it is usually too late and the process has already begun. If the victim questions the integrity of the process, the computer program may call ''them'' a \"scammer\" and can be quite vulgar. Quite often, the fraudulent negotiables are still sent to the address on the victim's resume, even after the fake online rant.\n\nThe scammer sends the victim fraudulent negotiables, assuring them that they get to keep part of the funds. They will expect the victim to send the remainder to various parties that they specify, under the guise that they are legitimate business contacts. This is a [[money laundering]] scheme, as the victim becomes a pawn in the filtering process. The process continues until the victim catches on, or even gets caught.\n\nAnother form of the scam is the \"Representative/Collection Agent\" variation wherein the scammer advertises, usually on legitimate online job sites, available positions for \"Representative or Collection Agent\" for a company abroad.  As the representative, the job involves receiving cash payments and depositing payments received from \"customers\" into one's account and remitting the rest to the overseas business bank account.  This is essentially money laundering.\n\n===Lottery scam===\n{{Main|Lottery scam}}\nThe lottery scam involves fake notices of lottery wins, although the intended victim has not entered the lottery. The \"winner\" is usually asked to send sensitive information such as name, residential address, occupation/position, lottery number etc. to a free email account which is at times untraceable or without any link. In addition to harvesting this information, the scammer then notifies the victim that releasing the funds requires some small fee (insurance, registration, or shipping). Once the victim sends the fee, the scammer invents another fee.\n\nThe [[#Fake checks|fake check]] technique described above is also used. Fake or stolen checks, representing a part payment of the winnings, being sent; then a fee, smaller than the amount received, is requested. The bank receiving the bad check eventually reclaims the funds from the victim.\n\nIn 2004, a variant of the lottery scam appeared in the United States: a scammer phones a victim purporting to be speaking on behalf of the government about a grant they qualify for, subject to an advance fee of typically US$250.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/crime/fraud/govgrant.asp |title=Government Grant Scam |publisher=snopes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref>\n\n===Online sales and rentals===\nMany scams involve the purchase of goods and services via classified advertisements, especially on sites like [[Craigslist]], [[eBay]], or [[Gumtree]]. These typically involve the scammer contacting the seller of a particular good or service via telephone or email expressing interest in the item. They will typically then send a fake [[cheque|check]] written for an amount greater than the asking price, asking the seller to send the difference to an alternate address, usually by [[money order]] or [[Western Union]]. A seller eager to sell a particular product may not wait for the check to clear, and when the bad check bounces, the funds wired have already been lost.<ref name=\"Fraudguides\">{{cite web|title=Craigslist Scams.|url=http://www.fraudguides.com/internet-craigslist-scams.asp|publisher=fraudguides.com|accessdate=June 24, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705075209/http://www.fraudguides.com/internet-craigslist-scams.asp|archivedate=July 5, 2012}}</ref>\n\nSome scammers advertise phony academic conferences in exotic or international locations, complete with fake websites, scheduled agendas and advertising experts in a particular field that will be presenting there.

The pet may either be advertised as being for-sale or up for adoption. Typically the pet is advertised on online advertising pages complete with photographs taken from various sources such as real advertisements, blogs or wherever an image can be stolen. Upon the potential victim contacting the scammer, the scammer responds by asking for details pertaining to the potential victim's circumstances and location under the pretense of ensuring that the pet would have a suitable home.<ref name=\"American Kennel Club\">{{cite web|title=AKC and Better Business Bureau Warn Consumers to Be Wary of Puppy Scams|url=http://www.akc.org/news/index.cfm?article_id=3220|accessdate=May 29, 2007}}</ref>\n\nBy determining the location of the victim, the scammer ensures he is far enough from the victim so as to not allow the buyer to physically view the pet. Should the scammer be questioned, as the advertisement claimed a location initially, the scammer will claim work circumstances having forced him to relocate. This forces a situation whereby all communication is either via email, telephone (normally untraceable numbers) and SMS.<ref name=\"American Kennel Club\">{{cite web|title=AKC and Better Business Bureau Warn Consumers to Be Wary of Puppy Scams|url=http://www.akc.org/news/index.cfm?article_id=3220|accessdate=May 29, 2007}}</ref>\n\nUpon the victim deciding to adopt or purchase the pet, a courier has to be used which is in reality part of the scam. If this is for an adopted pet, typically the victim is expected to pay some fee such as insurance, food or shipping. Payment is via MoneyGram, Western Union or money mules' bank accounts where other victims have been duped into work from home scams.<ref name=\"American Kennel Club\">{{cite web|title=AKC and Better Business Bureau Warn Consumers to Be Wary of Puppy Scams|url=http://www.akc.org/news/index.cfm?article_id=3220|accessdate=May 29, 2007}}</ref>\n\nNumerous problems are encountered in the courier phase of the scam. The crate is too small and the victim has the option of either purchasing a crate with air conditioning or renting one while also paying a deposit, typically called a caution or cautionary fee. The victim may also have to pay for insurance if such fees have not been paid yet. If the victim pays these fees, the pet may become sick and a veterinarian's assistance is sought for which the victim has to repay the courier.<ref name=\"Herb_Weisbaum\">{{cite news|last=Weisbaum|first=Herb|title=Hound hoax: Con artists target dog lovers|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/19299243|accessdate=June 18, 2007|newspaper=[[NBC News]]}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, the victim may be asked to pay for a health certificate needed to transport the pet, and for kennel fees during the recuperation period.

This is a [[confidence trick]] in which the [[Mark (victim)|mark]], or \"[[pigeon]]\", is persuaded to give up a sum of money in order to secure the rights to a larger sum of money, or more valuable object. In reality, the scammers make off with the money and the mark is left with nothing. In the process, the stranger (actually a confidence trickster) puts his money with the mark's money (in an envelope, briefcase, or bag) which the mark is then apparently entrusted with; it is actually switched for a bag full of newspaper or other worthless material. Through various theatrics, the mark is given the opportunity to leave with the money without the stranger realizing. In reality, the mark would be fleeing from his own money, which the con man still has (or has handed off to an [[accomplice]]).<ref name=\"Zak_Paul\">{{cite news|last=Zak|first=Paul J.|title=How to Run a Con|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-moral-molecule/200811/how-run-con|accessdate=June 23, 2012|newspaper=[[Psychology Today]]|date=November 13, 2008}}</ref>\n\nSome scammers will go after the victims of previous scams; known as a [[reloading scam]]. For example, they may contact a victim saying they can track and apprehend the scammer and recover the money lost by the victim, for a price. Or they may say a fund has been set up by the Nigerian government to compensate victims of 419 fraud, and all that is required is proof of the loss, personal information, and a processing and handling fee.

The details vary, but the usual story is that a person, often a government or bank employee, knows of a large amount of unclaimed money or gold which they cannot access directly, usually because they have no right to it. \n\nSuch people, who may be real but impersonated people or fictitious characters played by the [[con artist]], could include, for example, the wife or son of a deposed African leader who has amassed a stolen fortune, a bank employee who knows of a terminally ill wealthy person with no relatives, or a wealthy foreigner who deposited money in the bank just before dying in a plane crash (leaving no [[will (law)|will]] or known [[next of kin]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/consumersmarts/archives/125509.asp |title=Latest e-mail uses Alaska Airlines crash victims to scam &#124; Consumer News - seattlepi.com |publisher=Blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com |date=2007-11-09 |accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref> a US soldier who has stumbled upon a hidden cache of gold in Iraq, a business being audited by the government, a disgruntled worker or corrupt government official who has embezzled funds, a refugee,<ref>{{cite web|title = Zimbabwe appeal|url = http://www.scamnet.wa.gov.au/scamnet/Types_Of_Scams-Charity_Scams-Zimbabwe_appeal.htm|website = Department of Commerce - WA ScamNet|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}</ref> and similar characters. \n\nThe money could be in the form of [[gold as an investment|gold bullion]], gold dust, money in a bank account, [[blood diamond]]s, a series of checks or bank drafts, and so forth. The sums involved are usually in the millions of dollars, and the investor is promised a large share, typically ten to forty percent, in return for assisting the fraudster to retrieve or expatriate the money. Although the vast majority of recipients do not respond to these emails, a very small percentage do, enough to make the fraud worthwhile, as many millions of messages can be sent daily.\n\nTo help persuade the victim to agree to the deal, the scammer often sends one or more false documents which bear official government [[rubber stamps|stamps]], and [[seal (device)|seals]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Longmore-Etheridge|first=Ann|title=Nigerian scam goes on|journal=Security Management|date=August 1996|volume=40|issue=8|page=109|id={{ProQuest|231127826}}}}</ref> 419 scammers often mention false addresses and use photographs taken from the Internet or from magazines to falsely represent themselves. Often a photograph used by a scammer is not a picture of any person involved in the scheme. Multiple \"people\" may write or be involved in schemes as they continue, but they are often fictitious; in many cases, one person controls many fictitious personae all used in scams.<ref name=\"usembassy\"/>\n\nOnce the victim's confidence has been gained, the scammer then introduces a delay or monetary hurdle that prevents the deal from occurring as planned, such as \"To transmit the money, we need to bribe a bank official. Could you help us with a loan?\" or \"For you to be a party to the transaction, you must have holdings at a Nigerian bank of $100,000 or more\" or similar. This is the money being stolen from the victim; the victim willingly transfers the money, usually through some irreversible channel such as a [[wire transfer]], and the scammer receives and pockets it.<ref name=\"usembassy\"/>\n\nMore delays and additional costs are added, always keeping the promise of an imminent large transfer alive, convincing the victim that the money the victim is currently paying is covered several times over by the payoff. The implication that these payments will be used for \"white-collar\" crime such as bribery, and even that the money they are being promised is being stolen from a government or royal/wealthy family, often prevents the victim from telling others about the \"transaction\", as it would involve admitting that they intended to be complicit in an international crime.<ref name=\"usembassy\"/>\n\nSometimes psychological pressure is added by claiming that the Nigerian side, to pay certain fees, had to sell belongings and borrow money on a house, or by comparing the salary scale and living conditions in Africa to those in the West. Much of the time, however, the needed psychological pressure is self-applied; once the victims have provided money toward the payoff, they feel they have a vested interest in seeing the \"deal\" through. Some victims even believe they can cheat the other party, and walk away with all the money instead of just the percentage they were promised.<ref name=\"usembassy\"/>\n\nThe essential fact in all advance-fee fraud operations is the promised money transfer to the victim never happens, because the money does not exist. The perpetrators rely on the fact that, by the time the victim realizes this (often only after being confronted by a third party who has noticed the transactions or conversation and recognized the scam), the victim may have sent thousands of dollars of their own money, and sometimes thousands more that has been borrowed or stolen, to the scammer via an untraceable and/or irreversible means such as wire transfer.<ref name=\"usembassy\"/> The scammer disappears, and the victim is left on the hook for the money sent to the scammer.\n\nDuring the course of many schemes, scammers ask victims to supply bank account information. Usually this is a \"test\" devised by the scammer to gauge the victim's [[gullibility]];<ref name=\"Netherlands\"/> the bank account information isn't used directly by the scammer, because a fraudulent withdrawal from the account is more easily detected, reversed, and traced. Scammers instead usually request that payments be made using a wire transfer service like [[Western Union]] and [[MoneyGram]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Advance Fee Loan Scams {{!}} DirectLendingSolutions.com\u00ae|url = https://www.directlendingsolutions.com/loan_scam.htm|website = www.directlendingsolutions.com|accessdate = 2015-09-24}}</ref> The reason given by the scammer usually relates to the speed at which the payment can be received and processed, allowing quick release of the supposed payoff. The real reason is that wire transfers and similar methods of payment are irreversible, untraceable and, because identification beyond knowledge of the details of the transaction is often not required, completely anonymous.<ref name=\"usembassy\"/> However, bank account information obtained by scammers is sometimes sold in bulk to other fraudsters, who wait a few months for the victim to repair the damage caused by the initial scam, before raiding any accounts which the victim didn't close.\n\nTelephone numbers used by scammers tend to come from [[burner phones]]. In [[Ivory Coast]] a scammer may purchase an inexpensive mobile phone and a pre-paid SIM card without submitting any identifying information. If the scammers believe they are being traced, they discard their mobile phones and purchase new ones.<ref name=\"usembassy\"/>\n\nThe spam emails used in these scams are often sent from [[Internet caf\u00e9]]s equipped with satellite internet connection. Recipient addresses and email content are copied and pasted into a webmail interface using a stand-alone storage medium, such as a memory card. Certain areas of [[Lagos]], such as [[Festac]], contain many cyber caf\u00e9s that serve scammers; cyber caf\u00e9s often seal their doors outside hours, such as from 10:30pm to 7:00am, so that scammers inside may work without fear of discovery.<ref name=\"eat\">{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/latimests/20051020/ts_latimes/iwilleatyourdollars |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |date=2005-10-29 |accessdate=2012-02-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051029165224/http://news.yahoo.com/s/latimests/20051020/ts_latimes/iwilleatyourdollars |archivedate=October 29, 2005 }}</ref>\n\nNigeria also contains many businesses that provide false documents used in scams; after a scam involving a forged signature of Nigerian President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] in summer 2005, Nigerian authorities raided a market in the Oluwole section of Lagos. The police seized thousands of Nigerian and non-Nigerian passports, 10,000 blank [[British Airways]] boarding passes, 10,000 United States Postal [[money order]]s, customs documents, false university certificates, 500 printing plates, and 500 computers.<ref name=\"eat\"/>\n\nThe \"success rate\" of the scammers is also hard to gauge, since they are operating illegally and do not keep track of specific numbers. One individual estimated he sent 500 emails per day and received about seven replies, citing that when he received a reply, he was 70 percent certain he would get the money.<ref name=\"Dixon_Robyn\"/> If tens of thousands of emails are sent every day by thousands of individuals, it doesn't take a very high success rate to be worthwhile.<ref name=\"Grinker_Roy\">{{cite book|author1=Grinker, Roy R. |author2=Lubkemann, Stephen C. |author3=Steiner, Christopher B. |title=Perspectives on Africa: A Reader in Culture, History and Representation|year=2010|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=[[New York City]]|isbn=978-1-4443-3522-4|pages=618\u2013621|url=https://books.google.com/?id=myLOFYZ4dQ0C&pg=PA621&lpg=PA621&dq=nigerian+scam+success+rate#v=onepage&q=nigerian%20scam%20success%20rate&f=false}}</ref>\n\n==Countermeasures==\n[[File:Firefox 2.0.0.1 Phising Alert.png|thumb|Screenshot of a suspicious site warning in the [[Firefox]] browser<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/2.0.0.1/releasenotes/ |title=Firefox Release Notes|publisher=Mozilla|accessdate=14 September 2010}}</ref>]]\nIn recent years, efforts have been made by governments, internet companies, and individuals to combat scammers involved in advance-fee fraud and 419 scams. In 2004, the Nigerian government formed the [[Economic and Financial Crimes Commission]] (EFCC) to combat economic and financial crimes, such as advanced fee fraud.<ref name=\"EFCC\">{{cite web|title=Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (Establishment) Act of 2004 |url=http://www.efccnigeria.org/efcc_homepage_files/establishment_act_2004.pdf |publisher=Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (Nigeria) |accessdate=June 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628080831/http://www.efccnigeria.org/efcc_homepage_files/establishment_act_2004.pdf |archivedate=June 28, 2012 }}</ref> In 2009, Nigeria's EFCC announced that they have adopted smart technology developed by [[Microsoft]] to track down fraudulent emails. They hoped to have the service, dubbed \"Eagle Claw\", running at full capacity to warn a quarter of a million potential victims.<ref name=\"AFP_2009\"/>\n\nSome individuals participate in a practice known as [[scam baiting]], in which they pose as potential targets and engage the scammers in lengthy dialogue so as to waste the scammer's time and decrease the time they have available for real victims.<ref name=\"Cheng_Jacqui\">{{cite news|last=Cheng|first=Jacqui|title=Baiting Nigerian scammers for fun (not so much for profit).|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2009/05/baiting-nigerian-scammers-for-fun-not-so-much-for-profit/|accessdate=June 22, 2012|newspaper=[[Ars Technica]]|date=May 11, 2009}}</ref> Details on the practice of scam baiting, and ideas, are chronicled on a website, [[419eater.com]], launched in 2003 by Michael Berry. One particularly notable case of scam baiting involved an American who identified himself to a Nigerian scammer as [[James T. Kirk]]. When the scammer \u2014 who apparently had never heard of the television series ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' \u2014 asked for his passport details, \"Kirk\" sent a copy of a fake passport with a photo of ''Star Trek''{{'}}s Captain Kirk, hoping the scammer would attempt to use it and get arrested.<ref name=\"Corbin_Jane\">{{cite news|last=Corbin|first=Jane|title=A mysterious email and a split-second mistake: That's all it took for internet gangsters to hijack my life...|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1243634/A-mysterious-email-split-second-mistake-Thats-took-internet-gangsters-hijack-life-.html|accessdate=June 22, 2012|newspaper=[[Daily Mail]]|date=January 15, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Common elements==\n===Irreversible money transfers===\nA central element of advance-fee fraud is the transaction from the victim to the scammer must be untraceable and irreversible. Otherwise, the victim, once they become aware of the scam, can successfully retrieve their money and alert officials who can track the accounts used by the scammer.\n\nWire transfers via [[Western Union]] and [[MoneyGram]] are ideal for this purpose. International wire transfers cannot be cancelled or reversed, and the person receiving the money cannot be tracked. Other non-cancellable forms of payment include postal money orders and cashier's checks, but wire transfer via Western Union or MoneyGram is more common. [[Cryptocurrency]] payments are also used.\n\n===Anonymous communication===\nSince the scammer's operations must be untraceable to avoid identification, and because the scammer is often impersonating someone else, any communication between the scammer and his victim must be done through channels that hide the scammer's true identity. The following options in particular are widely used.\n\n====Web-based email====\nBecause many free email services do not require valid identifying information, and also allow communication with many victims in a short span of time, they are the preferred method of communication for scammers. Some services go so far as to mask the sender's source IP address ([[Gmail]] being a common choice), making the scammer more difficult to trace to the country of origin. While Gmail does indeed strip headers from emails, it is, in fact, possible to trace an IP address from such an email. Scammers can create as many accounts as they wish, and often have several at a time. In addition, if email providers are alerted to the scammer's activities and suspend the account, it is a trivial matter for the scammer to simply create a new account to resume scamming.\n\n====Email hijacking/friend scams====\nSome fraudsters hijack existing email accounts and use them for advance-fee fraud purposes. The fraudster impersonates associates, friends, or family members of the legitimate account owner in an attempt to defraud them.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gallagher|first=David F.|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/09/e-mail-scammers-ask-your-friends-for-money/index.html?ex=1352264400&en=597277d1a0cbde58&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss|title=E-Mail Scammers Ask Your Friends for Money|publisher=Bits.blogs.nytimes.com|date=2007-11-09|accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref> A variety of techniques such as [[phishing]], [[Keystroke logging|keyloggers]], and [[computer virus]]es are used to gain login information for the email address.\n\n====Fax transmissions====\n[[Fax|Facsimile machines]] are commonly used tools of business, whenever a client requires a hard copy of a document. They can also be simulated using web services, and made untraceable by the use of prepaid phones connected to mobile fax machines or by use of a public fax machine such as one owned by a document processing business like [[FedEx Office|FedEx Office/Kinko's]]. Thus, scammers posing as business entities often use fax transmissions as an anonymous form of communication. This is more expensive, as the prepaid phone and fax equipment cost more than email, but to a skeptical victim, it can be more believable.\n\n====SMS messages====\nAbusing [[Short Message Service|SMS]] bulk senders such as [[Wireless Application Service Provider|WASPs]], scammers subscribe to these services using fraudulent registration details and paying either via cash or stolen credit card details. They then send out masses of unsolicited SMSes to victims stating they have won a competition, lottery, reward, or an event, and they have to contact somebody to claim their prize. Typically the details of the party to be contacted will be an equally untraceable email address or a [[virtual telephone number]]. \n\nThese messages may be sent over a weekend when the staff at the service providers are not working, enabling the scammer to be able to abuse the services for a whole weekend. Even when traceable, they give out long and winding procedures for procuring the reward (real or unreal) and that too with the impending huge cost of transportation and tax or duty charges. The origin of such SMS messages is often from fake websites/addresses.\n\nA recent (mid-2011) innovation is the use of a Premium Rate 'call back' number (instead of a website or email) in the SMS. On calling the number, the victim is first reassured that 'they are a winner' and then subjected to a long series of instructions on how to collect their 'winnings'. During the message, there will be frequent instructions to 'ring back in the event of problems'. The call is always 'cut off' just before the victim has the chance to note all the details. Some victims call back multiple times in an effort to collect all the details. The scammer thus makes their money out of the fees charged for the calls.\n\n====Telecommunications relay services====\nMany scams use telephone calls to convince the victim that the person on the other end of the deal is a real, truthful person. The scammer, possibly impersonating a person of a nationality, or gender, other than their own, would arouse suspicion by telephoning the victim. In these cases, scammers use [[Telecommunications Relay Service|TRS]], a US federally funded relay service where an operator or a text/speech translation program acts as an intermediary between someone using an ordinary telephone and a deaf caller using [[telecommunications device for the deaf|TDD]] or other [[teleprinter]] device. The scammer may claim they are deaf, and that they must use a relay service. The victim, possibly drawn in by sympathy for a disabled caller, might be more susceptible to the fraud.\n\nFCC regulations and confidentiality laws require operators to relay calls verbatim and adhere to a strict code of confidentiality and ethics. Thus, no relay operator may judge the legality and legitimacy of a relay call and must relay it without interference. This means the relay operator may not warn victims, even when they suspect the call is a scam. [[MCI Inc.|MCI]] said about one percent of their IP Relay calls in 2004 were scams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msnbc.msn.com/ID/4781806|title=Con artists target phone system for deaf|publisher=MSNBC|date=2004-04-20|accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref>\n\nTracking phone-based relay services is relatively easy, so scammers tend to prefer Internet Protocol-based relay services such as [[IP Relay]]. In a common strategy, they bind their overseas IP address to a router or server located on US soil, allowing them to use US-based relay service providers without interference.\n\nTRS is sometimes used to relay credit card information to make a fraudulent purchase with a stolen credit card. In many cases however, it is simply a means for the con artist to further lure the victim into the scam.\n\n===Invitation to visit the country===\nSometimes, victims are invited to a country to meet government officials, an associate of the scammer, or the scammer themselves. Some victims who travel are instead held for ransom. Scammers may tell a victim that they do not need  a [[visa (document)|visa]], or that the scammers will provide one.<ref name=\"StateDeptPub10465\">{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/2189.pdf |author=United States Department of State |title=Nigerian Advance Fee Fraud (DEPARTMENT OF STATE PUBLICATION 10465) |date=April 1997 |access-date=January 4, 2019 |publisher=State Dept.

Some of the more commonly seen variants involve [[employment scams]], [[lottery scam]]s, online sales and rentals, and [[romance scam]]s. Many scams involve online sales, such as those advertised on websites such as [[Craigslist]] and [[eBay]], or property rental. This article cannot list every known and future type of advanced fee fraud or 419 scheme; only some major types are described. Additional examples may be available in the ''[[#External links|external links]]'' section at the end of this article.\n\n===Employment scams===\nThis scam targets people who have posted their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s on e.g. job sites. The scammer sends a letter with a falsified company logo. The job offer usually indicates exceptional salary and benefits, and requests that the victim needs a \"work permit\" for working in the country, and includes the address of a (fake) \"government official\" to contact. The \"government official\" then proceeds to fleece the victim by extracting fees from the unsuspecting user for the work permit and other fees. A variant of the job scam recruits freelancers seeking work, such as editing or translation, then requires some advance payment before assignments are offered.\n\nMany legitimate (or at least fully registered) companies work on a similar basis, using this method as their primary source of earnings. Some modelling and escort agencies tell applicants that they have a number of clients lined up, but that they require some sort of prior \"registration fee\", usually paid in by an untraceable method, e.g. by Western Union transfer; once the fee is paid, the applicant is informed the client has cancelled, and not contacted again.\n\nThe scammer contacts the victim to interest them in a \"work-at-home\" opportunity, or asks them to cash a check or money order that for some reason cannot be redeemed locally. In one cover story, the perpetrator of the scam wishes the victim to work as a \"mystery shopper\", evaluating the service provided by MoneyGram or Western Union locations within major retailers such as [[Wal-Mart]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc5i.com/newsbycounty/14519865/detail.html|title=Denton Woman Says Mystery Shopper Job Was Scam|publisher=Nbc5i.com|date=November 6, 2007|accessdate=2009-06-10|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927013037/http://www.nbc5i.com/newsbycounty/14519865/detail.html|archivedate=2008-09-27}}</ref> The scammer sends the victim a forged or stolen check or money order [[#Fake checks|as described above]], the victim deposits it\u2014banks will often credit an account with the value of a check not obviously false\u2014 and sends the money to the scammer via wire transfer. Later the check is not honoured and the bank debits the victim's account. Schemes based solely on check cashing usually offer only a small part of the check's total amount, with the assurance that many more checks will follow; if the victim buys into the scam and cashes all the checks, the scammer can steal a lot in a very short time.\n\n====Bogus job offers====\nMore sophisticated scams advertise jobs with real companies and offer lucrative salaries and conditions with the fraudsters pretending to be recruitment agents. A bogus telephone or online interview may take place and after some time the applicant is informed that the job is theirs. To secure the job they are instructed to send money for their work visa or travel costs to the agent, or to a bogus travel agent who works on the scammer's behalf. No matter what the variation, they always involve the job seeker sending them or their agent money, credit card or bank account details.<ref name=\"Adams\">{{cite news|last1=Adams|first1=Tony|title=Columbus woman warns others to beware of job phishing scams.|url=http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/business/article136738313.html|accessdate=March 23, 2017|publisher=Ledger-Enquirer|date=March 6, 2017}}</ref> A newer form of employment scam has arisen in which users are sent a bogus job offer, but are not asked to give financial information. Instead, their personal information is harvested during the application process and then sold to third parties for a profit, or used for [[identity theft]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/09/AR2007020901925.html|title=Taking the Bait On a Phish Scam, Job Seekers Are Targets, Victims of Sophisticated Ploy|last=Shin|first=Annys|date=2007-10-02|newspaper=Washington Post|accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/11/business/fi-monster11|title=Sleeping on the job?

The attendees are then made to assist to a conference where a scammer will use elaborate manipulation techniques to convince the attendees to purchase products, in a similar manner to the catalog merchant business model, as a hiring requisite. Quite often, the company lacks any form of the physical catalog to help them sell products (e.g. jewelry). When \"given\" the job, the individual is then asked to promote the scam job offer on their own. They are also made to work the company unpaid as a form of \"training\".<ref name=\"Lee\">{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Diane|title=Upstate company posts salaried job ads, but isn't hiring for real positions say fmr. employees.|url=http://wspa.com/2017/02/23/upstate-company-posts-salaried-job-ads-but-isnt-hiring-real-for-positions-say-fmr-employees/|accessdate=March 23, 2017|publisher=[[WSPA-TV]]|date=February 23, 2017}}</ref> Similar scams involve making alleged job candidates pay money upfront in person for training materials or services, with the claim that upon successful completion, they will be offered a guaranteed job, which never materializes.<ref name=\"Kliot\">{{cite news|last1=Kliot|first1=Hannah|title=Online employment scams target college students.|url=http://www.ksat.com/education/college-students-targeted-by-online-employment-scams|accessdate=March 23, 2017|publisher=[[KSAT-TV]]|date=January 31, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Cash-handling scam====\nThese scammers do internet searches on various companies to obtain hiring managers' names. They then advertise job offers on Job Search sites. The job hunter will then apply for the position with a resume. The person applying for the position will get a message almost instantly from a common email account such as \"Yahoo\", asking for credentials. The scammer will sometimes request that the victim has an \"Instant Messenger\" chat to obtain more information. The scammer guarantees employment, usually through automated computer programs that have a certain algorithm, with \"canned responses\" in broken English.\n\nAt the \"Instant Messenger\" stage, it is usually too late and the process has already begun. If the victim questions the integrity of the process, the computer program may call ''them'' a \"scammer\" and can be quite vulgar. Quite often, the fraudulent negotiables are still sent to the address on the victim's resume, even after the fake online rant.\n\nThe scammer sends the victim fraudulent negotiables, assuring them that they get to keep part of the funds. They will expect the victim to send the remainder to various parties that they specify, under the guise that they are legitimate business contacts. This is a [[money laundering]] scheme, as the victim becomes a pawn in the filtering process. The process continues until the victim catches on, or even gets caught.\n\nAnother form of the scam is the \"Representative/Collection Agent\" variation wherein the scammer advertises, usually on legitimate online job sites, available positions for \"Representative or Collection Agent\" for a company abroad.  As the representative, the job involves receiving cash payments and depositing payments received from \"customers\" into one's account and remitting the rest to the overseas business bank account.  This is essentially money laundering.\n\n===Lottery scam===\n{{Main|Lottery scam}}\nThe lottery scam involves fake notices of lottery wins, although the intended victim has not entered the lottery. The \"winner\" is usually asked to send sensitive information such as name, residential address, occupation/position, lottery number etc. to a free email account which is at times untraceable or without any link. In addition to harvesting this information, the scammer then notifies the victim that releasing the funds requires some small fee (insurance, registration, or shipping). Once the victim sends the fee, the scammer invents another fee.\n\nThe [[#Fake checks|fake check]] technique described above is also used. Fake or stolen checks, representing a part payment of the winnings, being sent; then a fee, smaller than the amount received, is requested. The bank receiving the bad check eventually reclaims the funds from the victim.\n\nIn 2004, a variant of the lottery scam appeared in the United States: a scammer phones a victim purporting to be speaking on behalf of the government about a grant they qualify for, subject to an advance fee of typically US$250.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/crime/fraud/govgrant.asp |title=Government Grant Scam |publisher=snopes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref>\n\n===Online sales and rentals===\nMany scams involve the purchase of goods and services via classified advertisements, especially on sites like [[Craigslist]], [[eBay]], or [[Gumtree]]. These typically involve the scammer contacting the seller of a particular good or service via telephone or email expressing interest in the item. They will typically then send a fake [[cheque|check]] written for an amount greater than the asking price, asking the seller to send the difference to an alternate address, usually by [[money order]] or [[Western Union]]. A seller eager to sell a particular product may not wait for the check to clear, and when the bad check bounces, the funds wired have already been lost.<ref name=\"Fraudguides\">{{cite web|title=Craigslist Scams.|url=http://www.fraudguides.com/internet-craigslist-scams.asp|publisher=fraudguides.com|accessdate=June 24, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705075209/http://www.fraudguides.com/internet-craigslist-scams.asp|archivedate=July 5, 2012}}</ref>\n\nSome scammers advertise phony academic conferences in exotic or international locations, complete with fake websites, scheduled agendas and advertising experts in a particular field that will be presenting there. They offer to pay the airfare of the participants, but not the hotel accommodations. They will extract money from the victims when they attempt to reserve their accommodations in a non-existent hotel.<ref name=\"Grant_Bob\">{{cite news|last=Grant|first=Bob|title=Another fake conference?|url=http://classic.the-scientist.com/blog/display/56185/|accessdate=June 24, 2012|newspaper=[[The Scientist (magazine)|The Scientist]]|date=November 24, 2009}}</ref>\n\nSometimes, an inexpensive rental property is advertised by a fake landlord, who is typically out of state (or the country) and asking for the rent and/or deposit to be wired to them.<ref name=\"Sichelman_Lew\">{{cite news|last=Sichelman|first=Lew|title=Rental scams can target either landlords or tenants|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/mar/25/business/la-fi-lew-20120325|accessdate=June 23, 2012|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=March 25, 2012}}</ref> Or the [[con artist]] finds a property, pretends to be the owner, lists it online, and communicates with the would-be renter to make a cash deposit.<ref name=\"Aho_Karen\">{{cite news|last=Aho|first=Karen|title=Renters: Beware of new twists on an old scam|url=http://realestate.msn.com/article.aspx?cp-documentid=20482759|accessdate=June 24, 2012|newspaper=[[MSN]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512090312/http://realestate.msn.com/article.aspx?cp-documentid=20482759|archive-date=May 12, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The scammer may also be the renter as well, in which case they pretend to be a foreign student and contact a landlord seeking accommodation. They usually state they are not yet in the country and wish to secure accommodations prior to arriving.

The pet may either be advertised as being for-sale or up for adoption. Typically the pet is advertised on online advertising pages complete with photographs taken from various sources such as real advertisements, blogs or wherever an image can be stolen. Upon the potential victim contacting the scammer, the scammer responds by asking for details pertaining to the potential victim's circumstances and location under the pretense of ensuring that the pet would have a suitable home.<ref name=\"American Kennel Club\">{{cite web|title=AKC and Better Business Bureau Warn Consumers to Be Wary of Puppy Scams|url=http://www.akc.org/news/index.cfm?article_id=3220|accessdate=May 29, 2007}}</ref>\n\nBy determining the location of the victim, the scammer ensures he is far enough from the victim so as to not allow the buyer to physically view the pet. Should the scammer be questioned, as the advertisement claimed a location initially, the scammer will claim work circumstances having forced him to relocate. This forces a situation whereby all communication is either via email, telephone (normally untraceable numbers) and SMS.<ref name=\"American Kennel Club\">{{cite web|title=AKC and Better Business Bureau Warn Consumers to Be Wary of Puppy Scams|url=http://www.akc.org/news/index.cfm?article_id=3220|accessdate=May 29, 2007}}</ref>\n\nUpon the victim deciding to adopt or purchase the pet, a courier has to be used which is in reality part of the scam. If this is for an adopted pet, typically the victim is expected to pay some fee such as insurance, food or shipping. Payment is via MoneyGram, Western Union or money mules' bank accounts where other victims have been duped into work from home scams.<ref name=\"American Kennel Club\">{{cite web|title=AKC and Better Business Bureau Warn Consumers to Be Wary of Puppy Scams|url=http://www.akc.org/news/index.cfm?article_id=3220|accessdate=May 29, 2007}}</ref>\n\nNumerous problems are encountered in the courier phase of the scam. The crate is too small and the victim has the option of either purchasing a crate with air conditioning or renting one while also paying a deposit, typically called a caution or cautionary fee. The victim may also have to pay for insurance if such fees have not been paid yet. If the victim pays these fees, the pet may become sick and a veterinarian's assistance is sought for which the victim has to repay the courier.<ref name=\"Herb_Weisbaum\">{{cite news|last=Weisbaum|first=Herb|title=Hound hoax: Con artists target dog lovers|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/19299243|accessdate=June 18, 2007|newspaper=[[NBC News]]}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, the victim may be asked to pay for a health certificate needed to transport the pet, and for kennel fees during the recuperation period. The further the scam progresses, the more similar are the fictitious fees to those of typical 419 scams. It is not uncommon to see customs or like fees being claimed if such charges fit into the scam plot.<ref name=\"Herb_Weisbaum\">{{cite news|last=Weisbaum|first=Herb|title=Hound hoax: Con artists target dog lovers|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/19299243|accessdate=June 18, 2007|newspaper=[[NBC News]]}}</ref>\n\nNumerous scam websites may be used for this scam.

This is a [[confidence trick]] in which the [[Mark (victim)|mark]], or \"[[pigeon]]\", is persuaded to give up a sum of money in order to secure the rights to a larger sum of money, or more valuable object. In reality, the scammers make off with the money and the mark is left with nothing. In the process, the stranger (actually a confidence trickster) puts his money with the mark's money (in an envelope, briefcase, or bag) which the mark is then apparently entrusted with; it is actually switched for a bag full of newspaper or other worthless material. Through various theatrics, the mark is given the opportunity to leave with the money without the stranger realizing.

Consent must take place between two adults who are not incapacitated and can change during any time during the sexual act.\n\n== Types ==\n\n=== Child sexual abuse ===\n{{Main|Child sexual abuse}}\n\n[[Child sexual abuse]] is a form of child abuse in which an adult or older adolescent abuses a child for sexual stimulation.<ref name=medline2008>{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/childsexualabuse.html |title=Child Sexual Abuse |work=Medline Plus |date=2 April 2008 |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205001005/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/childsexualabuse.html |archivedate=5 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"APA Guidelines\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.54.8.586 |lay-url=http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&uid=1999-03403-007 |laysource=APA PsycNET |laydate=2008-05-07 |quote='''Abuse, sexual (child)''': generally defined as contacts between a child and an adult or other person significantly older or in a position of power or control over the child, where the child is being used for sexual stimulation of the adult or other person |title=Guidelines for psychological evaluations in child protection matters |year=1999 |journal=American Psychologist |volume=54 |issue=8 |pages=586\u201393 |pmid=10453704}}</ref> Forms of child sexual abuse include asking or pressuring a child to engage in sexual activities (regardless of the outcome), [[indecent exposure]] of the genitals to a child, displaying [[pornography]] to a child, actual [[human sexual behavior|sexual contact]] against a child, physical contact with the child's genitals, viewing of the child's genitalia without physical contact or using a child to produce [[child pornography]].<ref name=medline2008 /><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0145-2134(93)90061-9 |title=Asking about child sexual abuse: Methodological implications of a two stage survey |year=1993 |last1=Martin |first1=Judy |last2=Anderson |first2=Jessie |last3=Romans |first3=Sarah |last4=Mullen |first4=Paul |last5=O'Shea |first5=Martine |journal=Child Abuse & Neglect |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=383\u201392 |pmid=8330225}}</ref><ref name=nspcc>{{cite web |url=http://www.nspcc.org.uk/help-and-advice/worried-about-a-child/online-advice/sexual-abuse/sexual-abuse-a_wda87108.html |title=Child sexual abuse definition from |publisher=the NSPCC |accessdate=9 December 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207170534/http://www.nspcc.org.uk/help-and-advice/worried-about-a-child/online-advice/sexual-abuse/sexual-abuse-a_wda87108.html |archivedate=7 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe effects of child sexual abuse include [[clinical depression|depression]],<ref name=\"Roosa\">{{cite journal |pmid=10197407 |year=1999 |last1=Roosa |first1=MW |last2=Reinholtz |first2=C |last3=Angelini |first3=PJ |title=The relation of child sexual abuse and depression in young women: Comparisons across four ethnic groups |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=65\u201376 |journal=Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology}}</ref> [[post-traumatic stress disorder]],<ref name=\"widom\">{{cite journal |pmid=10450264 |year=1999 |last1=Widom |first1=CS |title=Posttraumatic stress disorder in abused and neglected children grown up |volume=156 |issue=8 |pages=1223\u20139 |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |doi=10.1176/ajp.156.8.1223|doi-broken-date=2020-03-27 }}</ref> [[anxiety]],<ref name=\"levitan\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/da.10077 |title=Childhood adversities associated with major depression and/or anxiety disorders in a community sample of Ontario: Issues of co-morbidity and specificity |year=2003 |last1=Levitan |first1=Robert D. |last2=Rector |first2=Neil A. |last3=Sheldon |first3=Tess |last4=Goering |first4=Paula |journal=Depression and Anxiety |volume=17 |pages=34\u201342 |pmid=12577276 |issue=1}}</ref> propensity to [[re-victimization]] in adulthood,<ref name=\"Messman-Moore\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/088626000015005003 |title=Child Sexual Abuse and Revictimization in the Form of Adult Sexual Abuse, Adult Physical Abuse, and Adult Psychological Maltreatment |year=2000 |last1=Messman-Moore |first1=T.

The most common assailants are caretakers, adult children, spouses and fellow facility residents.\nSigns that an elder is being assaulted include increased vaginal tearing, bleeding, bruising, infection, pelvic injury, soft tissue or bone injury.

In his dissenting opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court case ''[[U.S. v.

It also stated that less than 1% of victims collect damages and 50% of women lose their jobs or quit after the trauma. The court ruled in ''U.S. v. Morrison'' that Congress did not have the authority to enact part of the [[Violence Against Women Act]] because it did not have a direct impact on commerce.

The second sampling stage consisted of a random sample drawn from the primary sample unit frame enrolled in the 136 participating colleges and universities to increase the sample size to 4,609 undergraduate college students aged greater than or equal to 18 years old with a representative sample demographic matching the national demographic. Differential sampling rates of the PSU were used to ensure sufficient numbers of male and female, black and Hispanic students in the total sample population. After differential sample weighting, female students represented 55.5% of the sample; white students represented 72.8% of the sample, black students 10.3%, Hispanic students 7.1%, and 9.9% were other.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/MMWR/preview/mmwrhtml/00049859.htm|title=Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance: National College Health Risk Behavior Survey -- United States, 1995|work=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|date=14 November 1997|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619204741/https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00049859.htm|archivedate=19 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It was determined that nationwide, 13.1% of college students reported that they had been forced to have sexual intercourse against their will during their lifetime.

This is due to a variety of definitions and use of terminology to describe sexual offences within territories and states as each territory and state have their own legislation to define rape, attempted rape, sexual assault, aggravated sexual assault, sexual penetration or intercourse without consent and sexual violence.\n\nIn the State of New South Wales, sexual assault is a statutory offence punishable under s 61I of the [[Crimes Act 1900]]. The term \"sexual assault\" is equivalent to \"rape\" in ordinary parlance, while all other assaults of a sexual nature are termed \"indecent assault\".\n\nTo be liable for punishment under the [[Crimes Act 1900]], an offender must intend to commit an act of sexual intercourse as defined under s 61H(1) while having one of the states of knowledge of non-consent defined under s 61HA(3). But note that s 61HA(3) is an objective standard which only require the person has no reasonable grounds for believing the other person is consenting.<ref>See Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) s 61 HA (3)</ref> The maximum penalty for sexual assault is 14 years imprisonment.<ref>s 61H(1) Crimes Act 1990</ref>\n\nAggravated sexual assault is sexual intercourse with another person without the consent of the other person and in circumstances of aggravation. The maximum penalty is imprisonment for 20 years under s 61J of the Crimes Act.\n\nIn the state of Victoria, rape is punishable under s 38 of the Crimes Act 1958, with a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment.<ref>Crimes Act 1958 (VIC)</ref>\n\nIn the state of South Australia, rape is punishable under s 48 of the Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA) with a maximum term of life imprisonment.<ref>Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA).</ref>\n\nIn the state of Western Australia, sexual penetration is punishable under s 325 the Criminal Code Act 1913 with a maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment.<ref>Criminal Code Act 1913 (WA)</ref>\n\nIn the Northern Territory, offences of sexual intercourse and gross indecency without consent are punishable under s 192 of the Criminal Code Act 1983 and punishable with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.<ref>Criminal Code Act 1983 (NT)</ref>\n\nIn Queensland, rape and sexual assault are punishable under s 349, Chapter 32 of the Criminal Code Act 1899 with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.<ref>Criminal Code Act 1899 (QLD)</ref>\n\nIn Tasmania, rape is punishable under s 185 of the Criminal Code Act 1924 with a maximum punishment of 21 years under s389 of the Criminal Code Act 1924.<ref>Criminal Code 1924 (TAS)</ref>\n\nIn the Australian Capital Territory, sexual assault is punishable under Part 3 of the Crimes Act 1900 with a maximum punishment of 17 years.<ref>Crimes Act 1900 (ACT)</ref>\n\nSexual assault is considered a gendered crime which results in 85% of sexual assaults never coming to the attention of the criminal justice system according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.<ref>Australian Bureau of Statistics. (2005). Personal Safety Survey. Canberra: ABS</ref> This is due to low reporting rates, treatment of victims and distrust of the criminal justice system, difficulty in obtaining evidence and the belief in sexual assault myths.<ref>Heath, M.

Melbourne: Australian Centre for the Study of Sexual Assault</ref>\n\nHowever, once a person is charged, the public prosecutor will decide whether the case will proceed to trial based on whether there is sufficient evidence and whether a case is in the public interest.<ref>Lievore, D. (2005). Prosecutorial decisions in adult sexual assault cases. Trends and Issues in Crime and Criminal Justice, 291, January. Canberra: Australian Institute of Criminology</ref> Once the matter has reached trial, the matter will generally be heard in the District Court. This is because sexually violent crimes are mostly categorised as indictable offences (serious offences), as opposed to summary offences (minor offences). Sexual offences can also be heard in the Supreme Court, but more generally if the matter is being heard as an appeal.\n\nOnce the matter is being heard, the prosecution must provide evidence which proves \"beyond reasonable doubt\" that the offence was committed by the defendant. The standard of proof is vital in checking the power of the State.<ref name=\"aifs.gov.au\">{{cite web |url=https://aifs.gov.au/publications/sexual-assault-laws-australia |title=Sexual assault laws in Australia |accessdate=2017-03-05 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170306040553/https://aifs.gov.au/publications/sexual-assault-laws-australia |archivedate=6 March 2017 |df=dmy-all |date=2011-02-27 }}</ref> While as previously stated that each jurisdiction (State and Territory) has its own sexual offence legislation, there are many common elements to any criminal offence that advise on how the offence is defined and what must be proven by the prosecution in order to find the defendant guilty.<ref name=\"aifs.gov.au\"/> These elements are known as Actus Reus which comprises the physical element (see Ryan v Regina [1967])<ref>Ryan v R [1967] HCA 2; 121 CLR 205</ref> and the Mens Rea which comprises the mental element (see He Kaw Teh (1985)).<ref>He Kaw Teh v R (1985) 157 CLR 523</ref>\n\nNotable sexual assault cases which have resulted in convictions are Regina v Bilal Skaf [2005]<ref>R v Bilal Skaf [2005] NSWCCA 297,16 September 2005</ref> and Regina v Mohommed Skaf [2005]<ref>R v Mohommed Skaf [2005] NSWCCA 298, 16 September 2005</ref> which were highly visible in New South Wales within the media the 2000s. These cases were closely watched by the media and led to legislative changes such as the passing of the Crimes Amendment (Aggravated Sexual Assault in Company) Act 2001 No 62<ref>Crimes Amendment (Aggravated Sexual Assault in Company) Act 2001 No 62</ref> which dramatically increased the sentences for \u2018gang rapists\u2019 by creating a new category of crime known as Aggravated Sexual Assault in Company. Changes were also made to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.<ref>Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 NSW</ref> This change is known as the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Victim Impact Statements) Act 2004 No 3<ref>Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Victim Impact Statements) Act 2004 No 3</ref> which expands the category of offences in respect of which a Local Court may receive and consider Victim Impact Statements to include some indictable offences which are usually dealt with summarily.\n\n=== Canada ===\nSexual assault is defined as sexual contact with another person without that other person's consent. Consent is defined in section 273.1(1) as \"''the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual activity in question''\".\n\nSection 265 of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] defines the offences of [[assault]] and sexual assault.\n\nSection 271 criminalizes \"Sexual assault\", section 272 criminalizes \"Sexual assault with a weapon, threats to a third party or causing bodily harm\" and section 273 criminalizes \"[[Aggravated sexual assault]]\".\n\n==== Consent ====\nThe absence of consent defines the crime of sexual assault. Section 273.1 (1) defines consent, section 273.1 (2) outlines certain circumstances where \"no consent\" is obtained, while section 273.1 (3) states that subsection (2) ''does not limit'' the circumstances where \"no consent\" is obtained (i.e. subsection (2) describes ''some'' circumstances which deem the act to be non-consensual, but other circumstances, not described in this section, can also deem the act as having been committed without consent). \"No consent\" to sexual assault is also subject to Section 265 (3), which also outlines several situations where the act is deemed non-consensual. In 2011, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in ''[[R. v. J.A.]]'' interpreted the provisions below to find that a person must have an active mind during the sexual activity in order to consent, and that they cannot give consent in advance.<ref name=\"Criminal Code\">{{cite web |url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-6.html#anchorbo-ga:l_VIII |title=Criminal Code |publisher=Laws.justice.gc.ca |accessdate=9 December 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109205822/http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-6.html#anchorbo-ga:l_VIII |archivedate=9 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Woman can't consent to sex while unconscious, Supreme Court rules |author=Mike Blanchfield |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2011/05/27/woman_cant_consent_to_sex_while_unconscious_supreme_court_rules.html |newspaper=[[The Toronto Star]] |date=27 May 2011 |accessdate=27 May 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612140715/http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2011/05/27/woman_cant_consent_to_sex_while_unconscious_supreme_court_rules.html |archivedate=12 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n*''Meaning of \"consent\"''\n\n''273.1'' (1) Subject to subsection (2) and subsection 265(3), \"consent\" means, for the purposes of sections 271, 272 and 273, ''the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual activity in question''.\n\n''Where no consent obtained''\n\n(2) No consent is obtained, for the purposes of sections 271, 272 and 273, where\n(a) the agreement is expressed by the words or conduct of a person other than the complainant;\n(b) the complainant is incapable of consenting to the activity;\n(c) the accused induces the complainant to engage in the activity by abusing a position of trust, power or authority;\n(d) the complainant expresses, by words or conduct, a lack of agreement to engage in the activity;

Section 2 of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act of 1981 states that a man has committed rape if he has sexual intercourse with a woman who at the time of the intercourse does not consent to it, and at that time he knows that she does not consent to the intercourse or he is reckless as to whether she does or does not consent to it. Under Section 4 of the Criminal Law (Rape Amendment) Act of 1990, rape means a sexual assault that includes penetration (however slight) of the anus or mouth by the penis or penetration (however slight) of the vagina by any object held or manipulated by another person. The maximum penalty for rape in Ireland is imprisonment for life.<ref>National SATU Guidelines Development Group.

Available at www.hse.ie/satu</ref>\n\n=== South Africa ===\nThe [[Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act]] created the offence of sexual assault, replacing a common-law offence of [[indecent assault]]. \"Sexual assault\" is defined as the unlawful and intentional sexual violation of another person without their consent. The Act's definition of \"sexual violation\" incorporates a number of sexual acts, including any genital contact that does not amount to penetration as well as any contact with the mouth designed to cause sexual arousal.

The most common assailants are caretakers, adult children, spouses and fellow facility residents.\nSigns that an elder is being assaulted include increased vaginal tearing, bleeding, bruising, infection, pelvic injury, soft tissue or bone injury.

Its focus is on who bystanders are, when they have helped, and how to intervene as a bystander in risky situations. The program includes a brief empathy induction component and a pledge to intervene in the future. Several studies show strong evidence of favorable outcomes including increased bystander efficacy, increased willingness to intervene as a bystander, and decreased rape myth acceptance.<ref>Banyard, Moynihan & Plante, 2007{{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}</ref><ref>Banyard, Plante & Moynihan, 2004{{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}</ref><ref>Banyard, Ward, Cohn, Plante, Moorhead, & Walsh, 2007{{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe MVP: Mentors in Violence Prevention was written by Jackson Katz. This program focuses on discussing a male bystander who didn't intervene when woman was in danger. An emphasis is placed on encouraging men to be active bystanders rather than standing by when they notice abuse. The bulk of the presentation is on processing hypothetical scenarios. Outcomes reported in research literature include lower levels of sexism and increased belief that participants could prevent violence against women.<ref>Cissner, 2009{{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Green Dot program was written by Dorothy Edwards.

This is due to a variety of definitions and use of terminology to describe sexual offences within territories and states as each territory and state have their own legislation to define rape, attempted rape, sexual assault, aggravated sexual assault, sexual penetration or intercourse without consent and sexual violence.\n\nIn the State of New South Wales, sexual assault is a statutory offence punishable under s 61I of the [[Crimes Act 1900]]. The term \"sexual assault\" is equivalent to \"rape\" in ordinary parlance, while all other assaults of a sexual nature are termed \"indecent assault\".\n\nTo be liable for punishment under the [[Crimes Act 1900]], an offender must intend to commit an act of sexual intercourse as defined under s 61H(1) while having one of the states of knowledge of non-consent defined under s 61HA(3). But note that s 61HA(3) is an objective standard which only require the person has no reasonable grounds for believing the other person is consenting.<ref>See Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) s 61 HA (3)</ref> The maximum penalty for sexual assault is 14 years imprisonment.<ref>s 61H(1) Crimes Act 1990</ref>\n\nAggravated sexual assault is sexual intercourse with another person without the consent of the other person and in circumstances of aggravation. The maximum penalty is imprisonment for 20 years under s 61J of the Crimes Act.\n\nIn the state of Victoria, rape is punishable under s 38 of the Crimes Act 1958, with a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment.<ref>Crimes Act 1958 (VIC)</ref>\n\nIn the state of South Australia, rape is punishable under s 48 of the Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA) with a maximum term of life imprisonment.<ref>Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA).</ref>\n\nIn the state of Western Australia, sexual penetration is punishable under s 325 the Criminal Code Act 1913 with a maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment.<ref>Criminal Code Act 1913 (WA)</ref>\n\nIn the Northern Territory, offences of sexual intercourse and gross indecency without consent are punishable under s 192 of the Criminal Code Act 1983 and punishable with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.<ref>Criminal Code Act 1983 (NT)</ref>\n\nIn Queensland, rape and sexual assault are punishable under s 349, Chapter 32 of the Criminal Code Act 1899 with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.<ref>Criminal Code Act 1899 (QLD)</ref>\n\nIn Tasmania, rape is punishable under s 185 of the Criminal Code Act 1924 with a maximum punishment of 21 years under s389 of the Criminal Code Act 1924.<ref>Criminal Code 1924 (TAS)</ref>\n\nIn the Australian Capital Territory, sexual assault is punishable under Part 3 of the Crimes Act 1900 with a maximum punishment of 17 years.<ref>Crimes Act 1900 (ACT)</ref>\n\nSexual assault is considered a gendered crime which results in 85% of sexual assaults never coming to the attention of the criminal justice system according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.<ref>Australian Bureau of Statistics.

Canberra: Australian Institute of Criminology</ref> Once the matter has reached trial, the matter will generally be heard in the District Court. This is because sexually violent crimes are mostly categorised as indictable offences (serious offences), as opposed to summary offences (minor offences). Sexual offences can also be heard in the Supreme Court, but more generally if the matter is being heard as an appeal.\n\nOnce the matter is being heard, the prosecution must provide evidence which proves \"beyond reasonable doubt\" that the offence was committed by the defendant.

Consent is defined in section 273.1(1) as \"''the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual activity in question''\".\n\nSection 265 of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] defines the offences of [[assault]] and sexual assault.\n\nSection 271 criminalizes \"Sexual assault\", section 272 criminalizes \"Sexual assault with a weapon, threats to a third party or causing bodily harm\" and section 273 criminalizes \"[[Aggravated sexual assault]]\".\n\n==== Consent ====\nThe absence of consent defines the crime of sexual assault. Section 273.1 (1) defines consent, section 273.1 (2) outlines certain circumstances where \"no consent\" is obtained, while section 273.1 (3) states that subsection (2) ''does not limit'' the circumstances where \"no consent\" is obtained (i.e. subsection (2) describes ''some'' circumstances which deem the act to be non-consensual, but other circumstances, not described in this section, can also deem the act as having been committed without consent). \"No consent\" to sexual assault is also subject to Section 265 (3), which also outlines several situations where the act is deemed non-consensual. In 2011, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in ''[[R. v. J.A.]]'' interpreted the provisions below to find that a person must have an active mind during the sexual activity in order to consent, and that they cannot give consent in advance.<ref name=\"Criminal Code\">{{cite web |url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-6.html#anchorbo-ga:l_VIII |title=Criminal Code |publisher=Laws.justice.gc.ca |accessdate=9 December 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109205822/http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-6.html#anchorbo-ga:l_VIII |archivedate=9 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Woman can't consent to sex while unconscious, Supreme Court rules |author=Mike Blanchfield |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2011/05/27/woman_cant_consent_to_sex_while_unconscious_supreme_court_rules.html |newspaper=[[The Toronto Star]] |date=27 May 2011 |accessdate=27 May 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612140715/http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2011/05/27/woman_cant_consent_to_sex_while_unconscious_supreme_court_rules.html |archivedate=12 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n*''Meaning of \"consent\"''\n\n''273.1'' (1) Subject to subsection (2) and subsection 265(3), \"consent\" means, for the purposes of sections 271, 272 and 273, ''the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual activity in question''.\n\n''Where no consent obtained''\n\n(2) No consent is obtained, for the purposes of sections 271, 272 and 273, where\n(a) the agreement is expressed by the words or conduct of a person other than the complainant;\n(b) the complainant is incapable of consenting to the activity;\n(c) the accused induces the complainant to engage in the activity by abusing a position of trust, power or authority;\n(d) the complainant expresses, by words or conduct, a lack of agreement to engage in the activity;

Under Section 4 of the Criminal Law (Rape Amendment) Act of 1990, rape means a sexual assault that includes penetration (however slight) of the anus or mouth by the penis or penetration (however slight) of the vagina by any object held or manipulated by another person. The maximum penalty for rape in Ireland is imprisonment for life.<ref>National SATU Guidelines Development Group.

Available at www.hse.ie/satu</ref>\n\n=== South Africa ===\nThe [[Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act]] created the offence of sexual assault, replacing a common-law offence of [[indecent assault]]. \"Sexual assault\" is defined as the unlawful and intentional sexual violation of another person without their consent. The Act's definition of \"sexual violation\" incorporates a number of sexual acts, including any genital contact that does not amount to penetration as well as any contact with the mouth designed to cause sexual arousal. Non-consensual acts that involve actual penetration are rape rather than sexual assault.\n\nUnlawfully and intentionally inspiring the belief in another person that they will be sexually violated also amounts to sexual assault. The Act also created the offences of \"compelled sexual assault\", when a person forces a second person to commit an act of sexual violation with a third person; and \"compelled self-sexual assault\", when a person forces another person to masturbate or commit various other sexual acts on theirself.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=77866 |title=Welcome to the official South African government online site! &#124; South African Government |website=Info.gov.za |date=2016-08-11 |accessdate=2016-09-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629081854/http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=77866 |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n\n==== England and Wales ====\nSexual assault is a statutory offence in [[England and Wales]].
