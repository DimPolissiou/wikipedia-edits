Sized slightly larger than the S-10 Blazer, the five-door Explorer was nearly {{convert|23|in|0|}} longer than a 1990 Bronco II. As a more direct successor, a shorter-wheelbase three-door Explorer Sport was introduced (though still a foot longer than a Bronco II).

The exterior featured new front bodywork with new a new hood, front fenders, and a closer-fitting front bumper. Inside, the dashboard was redesigned, featuring a new instrument panel. Alongside the overall change in appearance, the new bodywork marked improvements in structural support. The 1989 Bronco II was short-lived as it was built for little less than a year when production ended in early 1990. It was succeeded by the larger [[Ford Explorer]] for 1991.\n\nAs a running change, four-wheel drive 1990 models produced after November 1989 were produced with [[Dana 35]] front axles, replacing the previous Dana 28 front axle.\n\n==Engines==\nThe 1984 and 1985 models were equipped with the [[Germany|German]]-built [[carbureted]] 2.8&nbsp;L [[Ford Cologne V6 engine#2.8|Cologne]] [[V6 engine|V-6]] with {{convert|115|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4600&nbsp;rpm, which was also used in the 1984 and 1985 [[Ford Ranger (North America)#First generation|Ford Ranger]].

While the Explorer was also based upon the Ranger (to the point of also sharing parts of its interior with the Bronco II and Ranger), the Explorer was a mid-size SUV. Sized slightly larger than the S-10 Blazer, the five-door Explorer was nearly {{convert|23|in|0|}} longer than a 1990 Bronco II. As a more direct successor, a shorter-wheelbase three-door Explorer Sport was introduced (though still a foot longer than a Bronco II). Shared with the Ranger and [[Ford Aerostar]], the Explorer was solely powered by a 160&nbsp;hp 4.0&nbsp;L ''[[Ford Cologne V6 engine#4.0|Cologne]]'' V6 engine.\n\nThe Explorer would be developed in parallel with the Ranger through its first generation until its major update in the 1995 to 2001 model years where it lost all its exterior styling shared with the Ranger.\n\n==Safety controversy==\nStability problems with Bronco II were noted during the design phase, as well as in the verification tests by 1981.<ref name=\"Baura\"/> For example, the J-turn test was canceled during the testing procedures by Ford officials \"out of fear of killing or injuring one of its own drivers.\"<ref name=\"Bogus\">{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=CBnBMiJq3SkC&pg=PA160&lpg=PA160&dq=Ford+considered+the+Bronco+II+so+dangerous+that+it+suspended |page=160 |title=Why lawsuits are good for America: disciplined democracy, big business, and the common law |first=Carl T. |last=Bogus |publisher=New York University Press |year=2003 |isbn=9780814799161 |accessdate=21 October 2015}}</ref> Engineering modifications were suggested, but Ford officials declined the modifications because they would have delayed the marketing of the new vehicles.<ref name=\"Bogus\"/> Eight months before production began, Ford's Office of General Counsel collected 113 documents concerning the new vehicle's handling problems.<ref name=\"Baura\"/> However, 53 of these test, simulation, and related reports about stability of the Bronco II \"disappeared\" in an \"unusual document handling procedure\" that forebode the lawsuits against Ford starting in the late-1980s.<ref name=\"Baura\"/>\n\nThe Bronco II was dogged by reports that it was prone to [[Vehicle rollover|rollover]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.autosafety.org/srr/ROLLFBRO.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011109232459/http://www.autosafety.org/srr/ROLLFBRO.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2001-11-09 |format=PDF |title=Safety Research Report Index - Ford Bronco II Rollover |publisher=National Highway Traffic Safety Administration |accessdate=2011-04-01 }}</ref> Some of the headlines in 1989-90 included \"NHTSA Investigates Bronco II Rollovers,\" ''Automotive News'' (March 20, 1989) \"Magazine Gives Ford's Bronco II 'Avoid' Rating,\" ''The Wall Street Journal'' (May 8, 1989), and \"Consumer Reports Criticizes Ford Bronco II's Handling,\" ''The Washington Post'' (May 18, 1989).\n\nAfter analysis of SUV crashes of the [[Suzuki Samurai]], the U.S. [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) opened a formal study of the Ford Bronco II in 1989.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1989-03-16/business/fi-2108_1_ford-bronco-ii |title=Agency to Launch Study of Ford Bronco II After High Rate of Roll-Over Accidents |date=March 16, 1989 |first=Linda |last=Williams |newspaper=The Los Angeles Times |accessdate=27 November 2015}}</ref> There were 43 Bronco II rollover fatalities in 1987, compared with eight for the Samurai, but accident data in four states showed the Bronco II's rollover rate was similar to that of other SUVs, so the investigation was closed.
