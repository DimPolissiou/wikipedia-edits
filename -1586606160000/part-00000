{"title_page": "Lists of mathematics topics", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{MathTopicTOC}}\n'''Lists of mathematics topics''' cover a variety of topics related to [[mathematics]]. Some of these lists link to hundreds of articles; some link only to a few. The template to the right includes links to alphabetical lists of all mathematical articles. This article brings together the same content organized in a manner better suited for browsing.\nLists cover aspects of basic and advanced mathematics, methodology, mathematical statements, integrals, general concepts, mathematical objects, integrals and reference tables.\nThey also cover equations named after people, societies, mathematicians, journals and meta-lists.\n\nThe purpose of this list is ''not'' similar to that of the [[Mathematics Subject Classification]] formulated by the [[American Mathematical Society]]. Many mathematics journals ask authors of research papers and expository articles to list subject codes from the Mathematics Subject Classification in their papers. The subject codes so listed are used by the two major reviewing databases, ''[[Mathematical Reviews]]'' and ''[[Zentralblatt MATH]]''. This list has some items that would not fit in such a classification, such as [[list of exponential topics]] and [[list of factorial and binomial topics]], which may surprise the reader with the diversity of their coverage.\n\n==Basic mathematics==\nThis branch is typically taught in secondary education or in the first year of university.\n* [[Outline of discrete mathematics]]\n* [[List of calculus topics]]\n* [[List of geometry topics]]\n** [[Outline of geometry]]\n** [[List of trigonometry topics]]\n*** [[Outline of trigonometry]]\n*** [[List of trigonometric identities]]\n* [[List of topics in logic]] \n\n==Areas of advanced mathematics==\nSee also [[Areas of mathematics]] and [[Glossary of areas of mathematics]].\n\nAs a rough guide this list is divided into pure and applied sections although in reality these branches are overlapping and intertwined.\n\n===Pure mathematics===\n\n====Algebra====\n[[Algebra]] includes the study of algebraic structures, which are sets and operations defined on these sets satisfying certain axioms. The field of algebra is further divided according to which structure is studied; for instance, group theory concerns an algebraic structure called ''group''.\n* [[Outline of algebra]]\n* [[List of abstract algebra topics]]\n* [[List of algebraic structures]]\n* [[List of Boolean algebra topics]]\n* [[List of category theory topics]]\n* [[List of commutative algebra topics]]\n* [[List of homological algebra topics]]\n* [[List of group theory topics]]\n* [[List of representation theory topics]]\n* [[List of linear algebra topics]]\n* [[List of reciprocity laws]]\n* [[Glossary of field theory]]\n* [[Glossary of group theory]]\n* [[Glossary of linear algebra]]\n* [[Glossary of ring theory]]\n* [[List of cohomology theories]]\n\n====Calculus and analysis====\n[[File:Gibbs phenomenon 10.png|thumb|200px|right|[[Fourier series]] approximation of square wave in five steps.]]\n\n[[Calculus]] studies the computation of limits, derivatives, and integrals of functions of real numbers, and in particular studies instantaneous rates of change.

German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss said, \"Mathematics is the queen of the sciences\u2014and number theory is the queen of mathematics.\"\nNumber theory also studies the natural, or whole, numbers. One of the central concepts in number theory is that of the [[prime number]], and there are many questions about primes that appear simple but whose resolution continues to elude mathematicians.\n* [[List of algebraic number theory topics]]\n* [[List of number theory topics]]\n* [[List of recreational number theory topics]]\n* [[Glossary of arithmetic and Diophantine geometry]]\n* [[List of prime numbers]]&mdash;not just a table, but a list of various ''kinds'' of prime numbers (each with an accompanying table)\n* [[List of zeta functions]]\n\n===Applied mathematics===\n\n====Dynamical systems and differential equations====\n[[File:Limitcycle.svg|right|200px|thumb|Phase portrait of a continuous-time dynamical system, the [[Van der Pol oscillator]].]]\nA [[differential equation]] is an equation involving an unknown function and its derivatives.\n\nIn a [[dynamical system]], a fixed rule describes the time dependence of a point in a geometrical space. The mathematical models used to describe the swinging of a clock pendulum, the flow of water in a pipe, or the number of fish each spring in a lake are examples of dynamical systems.\n* [[List of dynamical systems and differential equations topics]]\n* [[List of partial differential equation topics]]\n* [[List of nonlinear partial differential equations]]\n\n====Mathematical physics====\n[[Mathematical physics]] is concerned with \"the application of mathematics to problems in physics and the development of mathematical methods suitable for such applications and for the formulation of physical theories\".{{ref|1|1}}\n* [[List of mathematical topics in classical mechanics]]\n* [[List of mathematical topics in quantum theory]]\n* [[List of mathematical topics in relativity]]\n* [[List of string theory topics]]\n* [[Index of wave articles]]\n\n====Computation====\n[[File:Raytraced image jawray.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Ray tracing (graphics)|Ray tracing]] is a process based on [[computational mathematics]].]]\nThe fields of mathematics and computing intersect both in [[computer science]], the study of algorithms and data structures, and in [[scientific computing]], the study of algorithmic methods for solving problems in mathematics, science and engineering.\n* [[List of algorithm general topics]]\n* [[List of computability and complexity topics]]\n* Lists for computational topics in geometry and graphics\n** [[List of combinatorial computational geometry topics]]\n** [[List of computer graphics and descriptive geometry topics]]\n** [[List of numerical computational geometry topics]]\n* [[List of computer vision topics]]\n* [[List of formal language and literal string topics]]\n* [[List of numerical analysis topics]]\n* [[List of terms relating to algorithms and data structures]]\n\n====Information theory and signal processing====\n[[Information theory]] is a branch of [[applied mathematics]] and [[electrical engineering]] involving the quantification of [[information]]. Historically, information theory was developed to find fundamental limits on compressing and reliably [[communication|communicating]] data.\n\n[[Signal processing]] is the analysis, interpretation, and manipulation of [[signal (electrical engineering)|signal]]s. Signals of interest include [[audio signal processing|sound]], [[image processing|images]], biological signals such as [[ECG]], [[radar]] signals, and many others. Processing of such signals includes [[filter (signal processing)|filtering]], storage and reconstruction, separation of information from [[noise]], [[data compression|compression]], and [[feature extraction]].\n* [[List of information theory topics]]\n* [[List of algebraic coding theory topics]]\n* [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Cryptography/List of cryptography topics|List of cryptography topics]]\n\n====Probability and statistics====\n[[File:Normal approximation to binomial.svg|200px|right|thumb|The \"bell curve\"\u2014the probability density function of the [[normal distribution]].]]\n{{Main|Lists of statistics topics}}\n[[Probability theory]] is the formalization and study of the mathematics of uncertain events or knowledge.

Some of these lists link to hundreds of articles; some link only to a few. The template to the right includes links to alphabetical lists of all mathematical articles. This article brings together the same content organized in a manner better suited for browsing.\nLists cover aspects of basic and advanced mathematics, methodology, mathematical statements, integrals, general concepts, mathematical objects, integrals and reference tables.\nThey also cover equations named after people, societies, mathematicians, journals and meta-lists.\n\nThe purpose of this list is ''not'' similar to that of the [[Mathematics Subject Classification]] formulated by the [[American Mathematical Society]]. Many mathematics journals ask authors of research papers and expository articles to list subject codes from the Mathematics Subject Classification in their papers. The subject codes so listed are used by the two major reviewing databases, ''[[Mathematical Reviews]]'' and ''[[Zentralblatt MATH]]''. This list has some items that would not fit in such a classification, such as [[list of exponential topics]] and [[list of factorial and binomial topics]], which may surprise the reader with the diversity of their coverage.\n\n==Basic mathematics==\nThis branch is typically taught in secondary education or in the first year of university.\n* [[Outline of discrete mathematics]]\n* [[List of calculus topics]]\n* [[List of geometry topics]]\n** [[Outline of geometry]]\n** [[List of trigonometry topics]]\n*** [[Outline of trigonometry]]\n*** [[List of trigonometric identities]]\n* [[List of topics in logic]] \n\n==Areas of advanced mathematics==\nSee also [[Areas of mathematics]] and [[Glossary of areas of mathematics]].\n\nAs a rough guide this list is divided into pure and applied sections although in reality these branches are overlapping and intertwined.\n\n===Pure mathematics===\n\n====Algebra====\n[[Algebra]] includes the study of algebraic structures, which are sets and operations defined on these sets satisfying certain axioms. The field of algebra is further divided according to which structure is studied; for instance, group theory concerns an algebraic structure called ''group''.\n* [[Outline of algebra]]\n* [[List of abstract algebra topics]]\n* [[List of algebraic structures]]\n* [[List of Boolean algebra topics]]\n* [[List of category theory topics]]\n* [[List of commutative algebra topics]]\n* [[List of homological algebra topics]]\n* [[List of group theory topics]]\n* [[List of representation theory topics]]\n* [[List of linear algebra topics]]\n* [[List of reciprocity laws]]\n* [[Glossary of field theory]]\n* [[Glossary of group theory]]\n* [[Glossary of linear algebra]]\n* [[Glossary of ring theory]]\n* [[List of cohomology theories]]\n\n====Calculus and analysis====\n[[File:Gibbs phenomenon 10.png|thumb|200px|right|[[Fourier series]] approximation of square wave in five steps.]]\n\n[[Calculus]] studies the computation of limits, derivatives, and integrals of functions of real numbers, and in particular studies instantaneous rates of change.

Aspects include \"counting\" the objects satisfying certain criteria (''[[enumerative combinatorics]]''), deciding when the criteria can be met, and constructing and analyzing objects meeting the criteria (as in ''[[combinatorial design]]s and [[matroid]] theory''), finding \"largest\", \"smallest\", or \"optimal\" objects (''[[extremal combinatorics]]'' and ''[[combinatorial optimization]]''), and finding [[algebra]]ic structures these objects may have (''[[algebraic combinatorics]]'').\n* [[Outline of combinatorics]]\n* [[List of graph theory topics]]\n* [[Glossary of graph theory]]\n\n====Logic====\n[[File:Venn A intersect B.svg|thumb|200px|right|[[Venn diagram]]s are illustrations of set theoretical, mathematical or logical relationships.]]\n[[Logic]] is the foundation which underlies [[mathematical logic]] and the rest of mathematics.

German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss said, \"Mathematics is the queen of the sciences\u2014and number theory is the queen of mathematics.\"\nNumber theory also studies the natural, or whole, numbers.

Historically, information theory was developed to find fundamental limits on compressing and reliably [[communication|communicating]] data.\n\n[[Signal processing]] is the analysis, interpretation, and manipulation of [[signal (electrical engineering)|signal]]s. Signals of interest include [[audio signal processing|sound]], [[image processing|images]], biological signals such as [[ECG]], [[radar]] signals, and many others.

People here learn more about healthy behavior: they are encouraged to think about the pros of changing their behavior and to feel emotions about the effects of their negative behavior on others.\n\nPrecontemplators typically underestimate the pros of changing, overestimate the cons, and often are not aware of making such mistakes.\n\nOne of the most effective steps that others can help with at this stage is to encourage them to become more mindful of their decision making and more conscious of the multiple benefits of changing an unhealthy behavior.\n\n'''Stage 2: Contemplation''' (getting ready)\n\nAt this stage, participants are intending to start the healthy behavior within the next 6 months. While they are usually now more aware of the pros of changing, their cons are about equal to their Pros. This ambivalence about changing can cause them to keep putting off taking action.\n\nPeople here learn about the kind of person they could be if they changed their behavior and learn more from people who behave in healthy ways.\n\nOthers can influence and help effectively at this stage by encouraging them to work at reducing the cons of changing their behavior.\n\n'''Stage 3: Preparation''' (ready)\n\nPeople at this stage are ready to start taking action within the next 30 days. They take small steps that they believe can help them make the healthy behavior a part of their lives. For example, they tell their friends and family that they want to change their behavior.\n\nPeople in this stage should be encouraged to seek support from friends they trust, tell people about their plan to change the way they act, and think about how they would feel if they behaved in a healthier way. Their number one concern is: when they act, will they fail? They learn that the better prepared they are, the more likely they are to keep progressing.\n\n'''Stage 4: Action''' (current action)\n\nPeople at this stage have changed their behavior within the last 6 months and need to work hard to keep moving ahead. These participants need to learn how to strengthen their commitments to change and to fight urges to slip back.\n\nPeople in this stage progress by being taught techniques for keeping up their commitments such as substituting activities related to the unhealthy behavior with positive ones, rewarding themselves for taking steps toward changing, and avoiding people and situations that tempt them to behave in unhealthy ways.\n\n'''Stage 5: Maintenance''' (monitoring)\n\nPeople at this stage changed their behavior more than 6 months ago. It is important for people in this stage to be aware of situations that may tempt them to slip back into doing the unhealthy behavior\u2014particularly stressful situations.\n\nIt is recommended that people in this stage seek support from and talk with people whom they trust, spend time with people who behave in healthy ways, and remember to engage in healthy activities to cope with stress instead of relying on unhealthy behavior.\n\n'''Relapse''' (recycling)<ref name=\"springerlink.com\">DiClemente, CC; Prochaska, JO; Gibertini, M.

Individuals who attempt to quit highly addictive behaviors such as drug, alcohol, and tobacco use are at particularly high risk of a relapse. Achieving a long-term behavior change often requires ongoing support from family members, a health coach, a physician, or another motivational source. Supportive literature and other resources can also be helpful to avoid a relapse from happening.\n\n===Processes of change===\n[[File:Processes of Change 3.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|Processes of change]]\nThe 10 processes of change are \"covert and overt activities that people use to progress through the stages\".<ref name=ProchaskaAJHP97/>\n\nTo progress through the early stages, people apply cognitive, affective, and evaluative processes.

The balance between the pros and cons varies depending on which stage of change the individual is in.\n\nSound decision making requires the consideration of the potential benefits (pros) and costs (cons) associated with a behavior's consequences. TTM research has found the following relationships between the pros, cons, and the stage of change across 48 behaviors and over 100 populations studied.\n* The cons of changing outweigh the pros in the Precontemplation stage.\n* The pros surpass the cons in the middle stages.\n* The pros outweigh the cons in the Action stage.<ref name=HallRossi2008>{{cite journal | last1 = Hall | first1 = K.L. | last2 = Rossi | first2 = J.

The psychology of attitudes. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich College Publishers, p. 1</ref> This means that by evaluating pros and cons we form a positive or negative attitude about something or someone. During the change process individuals gradually shift from cons to pros, forming a more positive attitude towards the target behaviour. Attitudes are one of the core constructs explaining behaviour and behaviour change in various research domains.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bagozzi | first1 = R.P. | last2 = Yi | first2 = Y. | year = 1989 | title = The Degree of Intention Formation as a Moderator of the Attitude-Behavior Relationship | url = | journal = Social Psychology Quarterly | volume = 52 | issue = | pages = 266\u2013279 }}</ref> Other behaviour models, such as the [[theory of planned behavior]] (TPB)<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ajzen | first1 = I | year = 1991 | title = The theory of planned behavior | url = | journal = Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes | volume = 50 | issue = | pages = 179\u2013211 }}</ref> and the stage model of self-regulated change,<ref name=\":6\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bamberg | first1 = S | year = 2013 | title = Changing environmentally harmful behaviors: A stage model of self-regulated behavioral change | url = | journal = Journal of Environmental Psychology | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 151\u2013159 }}</ref> also emphasise attitude as an important determinant of behaviour. The progression through the different stages of change is reflected in a gradual change in attitude before the individual acts. Most of the processes of change aim at evaluating and reevaluating as well as reinforcing specific elements of the current and target behaviour. The processes of change contribute to a great degree on attitude formation.\n\nDue to the synonymous use of decisional balance and attitude, travel behaviour researchers have begun to combine the TTM with the TPB.

A change in the level of self-efficacy can predict a lasting change in behavior if there are adequate incentives and skills.

Situational temptations assess how tempted people are to engage in a problem behavior in a certain situation.\n\n===Levels of change===\nThis core construct identifies the depth or complexity of presenting problems according to five levels of increasing complexity.<ref name=\"Prochaska2005\"/><ref name=\"Fromme2011\"/> Different therapeutic approaches are recommended for each level as well as for each stage of change.<ref name=\"Prochaska2005\"/><ref name=\"Prochaska1979\"/> The levels are:\n\n#Symptom/situational problems: e.g., [[motivational interviewing]], [[behavior therapy]], [[exposure therapy]]\n#Current maladaptive cognitions: e.g., [[Adlerian]] therapy, [[cognitive therapy]], [[rational emotive therapy]]\n#Current interpersonal conflicts: e.g., [[Harry Stack Sullivan|Sullivanian]] therapy, [[interpersonal therapy]]\n#Family/systems conflicts: e.g., [[strategic therapy]], [[Murray Bowen|Bowenian]] therapy, [[structural family therapy]]\n#Long-term intrapersonal conflicts: e.g., [[psychoanalytic]] therapies, [[existential therapy]], [[Gestalt therapy]]\n\n==Outcomes of programs==\n\nThe outcomes of the TTM computerized tailored interventions administered to participants in pre-Action stages are outlined below.\n\n===Stress management===\n\nA national sample of pre-Action adults was provided a stress management intervention.

Patients receiving the TTM intervention experienced significantly greater symptom reduction during the 9-month follow-up period. The intervention's largest effects were observed among patients with moderate or severe depression, and who were in the Precontemplation or Contemplation stage of change at baseline. For example, among patients in the Precontemplation or Contemplation stage, rates of reliable and clinically significant improvement in depression were 40% for treatment and 9% for control. Among patients with mild depression, or who were in the Action or Maintenance stage at baseline, the intervention helped prevent disease progression to Major Depression during the follow-up period.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Levesque | first1 = D.

Those randomly assigned to the treatment group received a stage-matched multiple behavior change guide and a series of tailored, individualized interventions for three health behaviors that are crucial to effective weight management: healthy eating (i.e., reducing calorie and dietary fat intake), moderate exercise, and managing emotional distress without eating. Up to three tailored reports (one per behavior) were delivered based on assessments conducted at four time points: baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months. All participants were followed up at 6, 12, and 24 months. Multiple Imputation was used to estimate missing data. Generalized Labor Estimating Equations (GLEE) were then used to examine differences between the treatment and comparison groups. At 24 months, those who were in a pre-Action stage for healthy eating at baseline and received treatment were significantly more likely to have reached Protons or Maintenance than the comparison group (47.5% vs. 34.3%). The intervention also impacted a related, but untreated behavior: fruit and vegetable consumption. Over 48% of those in the treatment group in a pre-Action stage at baseline progressed to Action or Maintenance for eating at least 5 servings a day of fruit and vegetables as opposed to 39% of the comparison group. Individuals in the treatment group who were in a pre-Action stage for exercise at baseline were also significantly more likely to reach Action or Maintenance (44.9% vs. 38.1%). The treatment also had a significant effect on managing emotional distress without eating, with 49.7% of those in a pre-Action stage at baseline moving to Action or Maintenance versus 30.3% of the comparison group. The groups differed on weight lost at 24 months among those in a pre-action stage for healthy eating and exercise at baseline. Among those in a pre-Action stage for both healthy eating and exercise at baseline, 30% of those randomized to the treatment group lost 5% or more of their body weight vs.18.6% in the comparison group. Coaction of behavior change occurred and was much more pronounced in the treatment group with the treatment group losing significantly more than the comparison group. This study demonstrates the ability of TTM-based tailored feedback to improve healthy eating, exercise, managing emotional distress, and weight on a population basis. The treatment produced the highest population impact to date on multiple health risk behaviors.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = S. S. | last2 = Paiva | first2 = A.

These may include: friends, books, and interactions with their healthcare providers. These factors could potentially influence how successful a patient may be in moving through the different stages. This stresses the importance to have continuous monitoring and efforts to maintain progress at each stage. TTM helps guide the treatment process at each stage, and may assist the healthcare provider in making an optimal therapeutic decision.\n\n=== Travel research ===\nThe use of TTM in travel behaviour interventions is rather novel. A number of cross-sectional studies investigated the individual constructs of TTM, e.g. stage of change, decisional balance and self-efficacy, with regards to transport mode choice. The cross-sectional studies identified both motivators and barriers at the different stages regarding biking, walking and public transport.<ref name=\":02\">{{cite journal | last1 = Mutrie | first1 = N. | last2 = Carney | first2 = C. | last3 = Blamey | first3 = A. | last4 = Crawford | first4 = F. | last5 = Aitchison | first5 = T. | last6 = Whitelaw | first6 = A. | year = 2002 | title = \"Walk in to work out\":A randomised controlled trial of a self help intervention to promote active commuting | url = | journal = J.

These interventions aim at changing people's travel behaviour towards more sustainable and more active transport modes.

A reduction in the number of cars on our roads solves other problems such as congestion, traffic noise and traffic accidents. By combining health and environment related purposes, the message becomes stronger. Additionally, by emphasising personal health, physical activity or even direct economic impact, people see a direct result from their changed behaviour, while saving the environment is a more general and effects are not directly noticeable.<ref>Cooper, C. \"Successfully changing individual travel behavior: Applying community-based social marketing to travel choice.

Health-centred intervention studies measured BMI, weight, waist circumference as well as general health. However, only one of three found a significant change in general health, while BMI and other measures had no effect.<ref name=\":02\" /> Measures that are associated with both health and sustainability were more common. Effects were reported as number of car trips, distance travelled, main mode share etc. Results varied due to greatly differing approaches. In general, car use could be reduced between 6% and 55%, while use of the alternative mode (walking, biking and/or public transport) increased between 11% and 150%.<ref name=\":12\"/> These results indicate a shift to action or maintenance stage, some researchers investigated attitude shifts such as the willingness to change. Attitudes towards using alternative modes improved with approximately 20% to 70%.<ref name=\":12\"/> Many of the intervention studies did not clearly differentiate between the five stages, but categorised participants in pre-action and action stage. This approach makes it difficult to assess the effects per stage. Also, interventions included different processes of change; in many cases these processes are not matched to the recommended stage.<ref name=\":12\"/> It highlights the need to develop a standardised approach for travel intervention design. Identifying and assessing which processes are most effective in the context of travel behaviour change should be a priority in the future in order to secure the role of TTM in travel behaviour research.\n\n==Criticisms==\nThe TTM has been called \"arguably the dominant model of health behaviour change, having received unprecedented research attention, yet it has simultaneously attracted criticism\".<ref name=\"Armitage\"/> Depending on the field of application (e.g. smoking cessation, substance abuse, condom use, diabetes treatment, obesity and travel) somewhat different criticisms have been raised.\n\nIn a [[systematic review]], published in 2003, of 23 [[randomized controlled trial]]s, the authors found that \"stage based interventions are no more effective than non-stage based interventions or no intervention in changing [[smoking]] behaviour.<ref>Riemsma, RP; Pattenden, J; Bridle, C; Sowden, AJ; Mather, L; Watt, IS; Walker, A.

People here learn more about healthy behavior: they are encouraged to think about the pros of changing their behavior and to feel emotions about the effects of their negative behavior on others.\n\nPrecontemplators typically underestimate the pros of changing, overestimate the cons, and often are not aware of making such mistakes.\n\nOne of the most effective steps that others can help with at this stage is to encourage them to become more mindful of their decision making and more conscious of the multiple benefits of changing an unhealthy behavior.\n\n'''Stage 2: Contemplation''' (getting ready)\n\nAt this stage, participants are intending to start the healthy behavior within the next 6 months. While they are usually now more aware of the pros of changing, their cons are about equal to their Pros. This ambivalence about changing can cause them to keep putting off taking action.\n\nPeople here learn about the kind of person they could be if they changed their behavior and learn more from people who behave in healthy ways.\n\nOthers can influence and help effectively at this stage by encouraging them to work at reducing the cons of changing their behavior.\n\n'''Stage 3: Preparation''' (ready)\n\nPeople at this stage are ready to start taking action within the next 30 days. They take small steps that they believe can help them make the healthy behavior a part of their lives. For example, they tell their friends and family that they want to change their behavior.\n\nPeople in this stage should be encouraged to seek support from friends they trust, tell people about their plan to change the way they act, and think about how they would feel if they behaved in a healthier way. Their number one concern is: when they act, will they fail? They learn that the better prepared they are, the more likely they are to keep progressing.\n\n'''Stage 4: Action''' (current action)\n\nPeople at this stage have changed their behavior within the last 6 months and need to work hard to keep moving ahead. These participants need to learn how to strengthen their commitments to change and to fight urges to slip back.\n\nPeople in this stage progress by being taught techniques for keeping up their commitments such as substituting activities related to the unhealthy behavior with positive ones, rewarding themselves for taking steps toward changing, and avoiding people and situations that tempt them to behave in unhealthy ways.\n\n'''Stage 5: Maintenance''' (monitoring)\n\nPeople at this stage changed their behavior more than 6 months ago. It is important for people in this stage to be aware of situations that may tempt them to slip back into doing the unhealthy behavior\u2014particularly stressful situations.\n\nIt is recommended that people in this stage seek support from and talk with people whom they trust, spend time with people who behave in healthy ways, and remember to engage in healthy activities to cope with stress instead of relying on unhealthy behavior.\n\n'''Relapse''' (recycling)<ref name=\"springerlink.com\">DiClemente, CC; Prochaska, JO; Gibertini, M.

Individuals who attempt to quit highly addictive behaviors such as drug, alcohol, and tobacco use are at particularly high risk of a relapse.

The pros and cons combine to form a decisional \"balance sheet\" of comparative potential gains and losses. The balance between the pros and cons varies depending on which stage of change the individual is in.\n\nSound decision making requires the consideration of the potential benefits (pros) and costs (cons) associated with a behavior's consequences. TTM research has found the following relationships between the pros, cons, and the stage of change across 48 behaviors and over 100 populations studied.\n* The cons of changing outweigh the pros in the Precontemplation stage.\n* The pros surpass the cons in the middle stages.\n* The pros outweigh the cons in the Action stage.<ref name=HallRossi2008>{{cite journal | last1 = Hall | first1 = K.L. | last2 = Rossi | first2 = J.

[[Attitude (psychology)|Attitude]] is defined as a \"psychological tendency that is expressed by evaluating a particular entity with some degree of favour or disfavour\".<ref>Eagly, A.H., Chaiken, S., 1993. The psychology of attitudes. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich College Publishers, p. 1</ref> This means that by evaluating pros and cons we form a positive or negative attitude about something or someone. During the change process individuals gradually shift from cons to pros, forming a more positive attitude towards the target behaviour. Attitudes are one of the core constructs explaining behaviour and behaviour change in various research domains.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bagozzi | first1 = R.P. | last2 = Yi | first2 = Y. | year = 1989 | title = The Degree of Intention Formation as a Moderator of the Attitude-Behavior Relationship | url = | journal = Social Psychology Quarterly | volume = 52 | issue = | pages = 266\u2013279 }}</ref> Other behaviour models, such as the [[theory of planned behavior]] (TPB)<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ajzen | first1 = I | year = 1991 | title = The theory of planned behavior | url = | journal = Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes | volume = 50 | issue = | pages = 179\u2013211 }}</ref> and the stage model of self-regulated change,<ref name=\":6\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bamberg | first1 = S | year = 2013 | title = Changing environmentally harmful behaviors: A stage model of self-regulated behavioral change | url = | journal = Journal of Environmental Psychology | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 151\u2013159 }}</ref> also emphasise attitude as an important determinant of behaviour. The progression through the different stages of change is reflected in a gradual change in attitude before the individual acts. Most of the processes of change aim at evaluating and reevaluating as well as reinforcing specific elements of the current and target behaviour. The processes of change contribute to a great degree on attitude formation.\n\nDue to the synonymous use of decisional balance and attitude, travel behaviour researchers have begun to combine the TTM with the TPB.

A change in the level of self-efficacy can predict a lasting change in behavior if there are adequate incentives and skills. The transtheoretical model employs an overall confidence score to assess an individual's self-efficacy. Situational temptations assess how tempted people are to engage in a problem behavior in a certain situation.\n\n===Levels of change===\nThis core construct identifies the depth or complexity of presenting problems according to five levels of increasing complexity.<ref name=\"Prochaska2005\"/><ref name=\"Fromme2011\"/> Different therapeutic approaches are recommended for each level as well as for each stage of change.<ref name=\"Prochaska2005\"/><ref name=\"Prochaska1979\"/> The levels are:\n\n#Symptom/situational problems: e.g., [[motivational interviewing]], [[behavior therapy]], [[exposure therapy]]\n#Current maladaptive cognitions: e.g., [[Adlerian]] therapy, [[cognitive therapy]], [[rational emotive therapy]]\n#Current interpersonal conflicts: e.g., [[Harry Stack Sullivan|Sullivanian]] therapy, [[interpersonal therapy]]\n#Family/systems conflicts: e.g., [[strategic therapy]], [[Murray Bowen|Bowenian]] therapy, [[structural family therapy]]\n#Long-term intrapersonal conflicts: e.g., [[psychoanalytic]] therapies, [[existential therapy]], [[Gestalt therapy]]\n\n==Outcomes of programs==\n\nThe outcomes of the TTM computerized tailored interventions administered to participants in pre-Action stages are outlined below.\n\n===Stress management===\n\nA national sample of pre-Action adults was provided a stress management intervention.

Additionally, only 15% of those in the intervention group who were already in Action or Maintenance relapsed into poor medication adherence compared to 45% of the controls. Further, participants who were at risk for physical activity and unhealthy diet were given only stage-based guidance.

Patients receiving the TTM intervention experienced significantly greater symptom reduction during the 9-month follow-up period. The intervention's largest effects were observed among patients with moderate or severe depression, and who were in the Precontemplation or Contemplation stage of change at baseline. For example, among patients in the Precontemplation or Contemplation stage, rates of reliable and clinically significant improvement in depression were 40% for treatment and 9% for control.

Those randomly assigned to the treatment group received a stage-matched multiple behavior change guide and a series of tailored, individualized interventions for three health behaviors that are crucial to effective weight management: healthy eating (i.e., reducing calorie and dietary fat intake), moderate exercise, and managing emotional distress without eating. Up to three tailored reports (one per behavior) were delivered based on assessments conducted at four time points: baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months. All participants were followed up at 6, 12, and 24 months. Multiple Imputation was used to estimate missing data. Generalized Labor Estimating Equations (GLEE) were then used to examine differences between the treatment and comparison groups. At 24 months, those who were in a pre-Action stage for healthy eating at baseline and received treatment were significantly more likely to have reached Protons or Maintenance than the comparison group (47.5% vs. 34.3%). The intervention also impacted a related, but untreated behavior: fruit and vegetable consumption. Over 48% of those in the treatment group in a pre-Action stage at baseline progressed to Action or Maintenance for eating at least 5 servings a day of fruit and vegetables as opposed to 39% of the comparison group. Individuals in the treatment group who were in a pre-Action stage for exercise at baseline were also significantly more likely to reach Action or Maintenance (44.9% vs. 38.1%). The treatment also had a significant effect on managing emotional distress without eating, with 49.7% of those in a pre-Action stage at baseline moving to Action or Maintenance versus 30.3% of the comparison group. The groups differed on weight lost at 24 months among those in a pre-action stage for healthy eating and exercise at baseline. Among those in a pre-Action stage for both healthy eating and exercise at baseline, 30% of those randomized to the treatment group lost 5% or more of their body weight vs.18.6% in the comparison group. Coaction of behavior change occurred and was much more pronounced in the treatment group with the treatment group losing significantly more than the comparison group. This study demonstrates the ability of TTM-based tailored feedback to improve healthy eating, exercise, managing emotional distress, and weight on a population basis. The treatment produced the highest population impact to date on multiple health risk behaviors.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = S. S. | last2 = Paiva | first2 = A.

These may include: friends, books, and interactions with their healthcare providers. These factors could potentially influence how successful a patient may be in moving through the different stages. This stresses the importance to have continuous monitoring and efforts to maintain progress at each stage. TTM helps guide the treatment process at each stage, and may assist the healthcare provider in making an optimal therapeutic decision.\n\n=== Travel research ===\nThe use of TTM in travel behaviour interventions is rather novel. A number of cross-sectional studies investigated the individual constructs of TTM, e.g. stage of change, decisional balance and self-efficacy, with regards to transport mode choice.

These interventions aim at changing people's travel behaviour towards more sustainable and more active transport modes.

A reduction in the number of cars on our roads solves other problems such as congestion, traffic noise and traffic accidents. By combining health and environment related purposes, the message becomes stronger. Additionally, by emphasising personal health, physical activity or even direct economic impact, people see a direct result from their changed behaviour, while saving the environment is a more general and effects are not directly noticeable.<ref>Cooper, C.

Health-centred intervention studies measured BMI, weight, waist circumference as well as general health. However, only one of three found a significant change in general health, while BMI and other measures had no effect.<ref name=\":02\" /> Measures that are associated with both health and sustainability were more common. Effects were reported as number of car trips, distance travelled, main mode share etc. Results varied due to greatly differing approaches. In general, car use could be reduced between 6% and 55%, while use of the alternative mode (walking, biking and/or public transport) increased between 11% and 150%.<ref name=\":12\"/> These results indicate a shift to action or maintenance stage, some researchers investigated attitude shifts such as the willingness to change. Attitudes towards using alternative modes improved with approximately 20% to 70%.<ref name=\":12\"/> Many of the intervention studies did not clearly differentiate between the five stages, but categorised participants in pre-action and action stage. This approach makes it difficult to assess the effects per stage. Also, interventions included different processes of change; in many cases these processes are not matched to the recommended stage.<ref name=\":12\"/> It highlights the need to develop a standardised approach for travel intervention design. Identifying and assessing which processes are most effective in the context of travel behaviour change should be a priority in the future in order to secure the role of TTM in travel behaviour research.\n\n==Criticisms==\nThe TTM has been called \"arguably the dominant model of health behaviour change, having received unprecedented research attention, yet it has simultaneously attracted criticism\".<ref name=\"Armitage\"/> Depending on the field of application (e.g. smoking cessation, substance abuse, condom use, diabetes treatment, obesity and travel) somewhat different criticisms have been raised.\n\nIn a [[systematic review]], published in 2003, of 23 [[randomized controlled trial]]s, the authors found that \"stage based interventions are no more effective than non-stage based interventions or no intervention in changing [[smoking]] behaviour.<ref>Riemsma, RP; Pattenden, J; Bridle, C; Sowden, AJ; Mather, L; Watt, IS; Walker, A.

Accessed 2009 Mar 18.</ref> However, it was also mentioned that stage based interventions are often used and implemented inadequately in practice. Thus, criticism is directed towards the use rather the effectiveness of the model itself. Looking at interventions targeting smoking cessation in pregnancy found that stage-matched interventions were more effective than non-matched interventions. One reason for this was the greater intensity of stage-matched interventions.<ref>Aveyard, P; Lawrence, T; Cheng, KK; Griffin, C; Croghan, E; Johnson, C.

The study claims that those not wanting to change (i.e. precontemplators) tend to be responsive to neither stage nor non-stage based interventions. Since stage-based interventions tend to be more intensive they appear to be most effective at targeting contemplators and above rather than pre-contemplators.<ref>Aveyard, P; Massey, L; Parsons, A; Manaseki, S; Griffin, C. {{doi|10.1016/j.socscimed.2008.10.036|The effect of transtheoretical model based interventions on smoking cessation.}} Soc Sci Med 2009 Feb;68(3):397\u2013403.

West claimed that a more coherent and distinguishable definition for the stages is needed.<ref name=\"West 2005\"/> Especially the fact that the stages are bound to a specific time interval is perceived to be misleading. Additionally, the effectiveness of stage-based interventions differs depending on the behavior. A continuous version of the model has been proposed, where each process is first increasingly used, and then decreases in importance, as smokers make progress along some latent dimension.<ref>{{cite journal |last=No\u00ebl |first=Yvonnick |date=June 1999 |title=Recovering unimodal latent patterns of change by unfolding analysis: application to smoking cessation |journal=[[Psychological Methods]] |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=173\u2013191 |doi=10.1037/1082-989X.4.2.173}}</ref> This proposal suggests the use of processes without reference to stages of change.\n\nThe model \"assumes that individuals typically make coherent and stable plans\", when in fact they often do not.<ref name=\"West 2005\"/>\n\nWithin research on prevention of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases a systematic review from 2003 comes to the conclusion that \"no strong conclusions\" can be drawn about the effectiveness of interventions based on the transtheoretical model.<ref name=\":2\">Horowitz, SM.

Health promotion practice 7, 428-443.</ref> A 2011 Cochrane Systematic Review found that there is little evidence to suggest that using the Transtheoretical Model Stages of Change (TTM SOC) method is effective in helping obese and overweight people lose weight. Earlier in a 2009 paper, the TTM was considered to be useful in promoting physical activity. In this study, the algorithms and questionnaires that researchers used to assign people to stages of change lacked standardisation to be compared empirically, or validated.<ref>Sallis, J.

The processes used to build the intervention are rarely stage-matched and short cuts are taken by classifying participants in a pre-action stage, which summarises the precontemplation, contemplation and preparation stage, and an action/maintenance stage.<ref name=\":12\" /> More generally, TTM has been criticised within various domains due to the limitations in the research designs. For example, many studies supporting the model have been [[Cross-sectional study|cross-sectional]], but [[longitudinal study]] data would allow for stronger causal inferences. Another point of criticism is raised in a 2002 review, where the model's stages were characterized as \"not mutually exclusive\".<ref name=\":32\">Littell, JH; Girvin, H.

Accessed 2009 Mar 19.</ref> Furthermore, there was \"scant evidence of sequential movement through discrete stages\".<ref name=\":32\" /> While research suggests that movement through the stages of change is not always linear, a study conducted in 1996 demonstrated that the probability of forward stage movement is greater than the probability of backward stage movement.<ref>Martin, R., Velicer, WF, Fava, JL. Latent transition analysis to the stages of change for smoking cessation. Addictive Behaviors 1996, 21(1):67-80</ref> Due to the variations in use, implementation and type of research designs, data confirming TTM are ambiguous.
