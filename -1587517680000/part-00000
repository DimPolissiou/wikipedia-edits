The most remembered, and not the least disputed, comes from the romanticized legend of the English lovers Robert Machim and Anne d'Arfet. As the legend explains, the two lovers escaped from England (where their love was forbidden and condemned by the Church), suffered the tragedy of a shipwreck and died on the island that became Madeira, where later the first Portuguese explorers encountered two crosses to which they attributed to the lovers: the name appears to be a corruption of the surname ''Machim''.<ref name=CHistoria/>\n\nOn 8 May 1440, the [[Infante]] [[Henry the Navigator]] awarded Trist\u00e3o Vaz and his descendants the [[Captaincy]] of Machico (which included the Ponta da Oliveira, in Cani\u00e7o, to the Ponta do S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o and from there to the Ponta do Trist\u00e3o, in Porto Moniz), and by right the first Captaincy in the archipelago of Madeira.<ref name=CHistoria/> The first settlers eked out a meagre subsistence, as a Franciscan friar noted: \n{{quote|''\"This Town of Machico (head and seat of the first Captain Trist\u00e3o) even if its small, with few users, it is well situated, happy, of many vegetable gardens and orchards, situated in the middle of a Ravine so fresh as in high elevations\"''|sign= Jer\u00f3nimo Dias Leite, 16th Century}}\n\nStill in the 15th century, taking advantage of the abundant water and excellent climate, the first colonists began to cultivate sugar cane, and the first machinery used to process the pulp appeared immediately, facilitating the export to Europe.<ref name=CHistoria/> Although the Captaincy did not have the best lands to cultivate the plant (by 1494 one-fifth of regional production), the village that developed at Machico's beachhead was the centre of the processing of this spice. As the monk Jer\u00f3nimo Dias Leite indicated: ''\"...the first sugar sold on this island of Madeira was in the town of Machico where there began a make and collect three [[arroba]]s [equivalent to 96 [[Pound (mass)|pounds]]] to sell, each arroba [32 pounds] sold for five cruzeiros [historical coinage of Portugal]...\"''.<ref name=CHistoria/>\n\nMachico grew to this lucrative commerce, while Machiquenses families become socially powerful and wealthy from the trade, including the families of the Captains-[[Donat\u00e1rio]]s (Trist\u00e3o Vaz's descendants).<ref name=CHistoria/> It was the Teixeira family that erected the first Matriz Church in Machico at the end of the 15th century, in honour of ''Nossa Senhora da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o'' (''Our Lady of Conception'').\n\nDuring the second half of the 15th century, along with Funchal, Machico was elevated to ''town'' (1451)<ref>The elevation of Machico to municipal seat was reconfirmed by King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] in 1515.</ref> and continued to grow, following the course of the ravine into the valley.<ref name=CHistoria/> Two poles developed: the right margin, that included the main barrio and the town's public institutions (municipal chamber, customshouse and church), and the left margin, that included nucleus of Banda d'Al\u00e9m, the Miseric\u00f3rdia (social centre) and Chapel of Christ, now known as the Chapel of ''Nosso Senhor dos Milagres'' (''Our Lord of Miracles'').<ref name=CHistoria/>\n\nIn 1803, a landslide was responsible for the destruction of various homes, destroying hedges and walls, the main bridge along the ravine and the Chapel of ''Nosso Senhor dos Milagres''.\n\nMachico also became a front-line during the ''Revolta da Madeira'' (''Madeira Revolt'') in April 1931.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Machico madeira01.jpg|thumb|235px|left|A hub of eastern traffic, Machico is cris-crossed by high-capacity freeways connecting it to settlements in the west]]\n[[File:Vale de Machico (Portugal) (55179482).jpg|235px|left|thumb|The valley of Machico extending into the foothills, is a concentrated mass of residential and commercial uses]]\n\n===Physical geography===\nMachico is located 17&nbsp;km northeast of Funchal, northwest of the uninhabitable [[Savage Islands]], 20&nbsp;km southeast of [[Santana, Madeira Islands|Santana]] and west-southwest of [[Porto Santo Island|Porto Santo]] in the extreme eastern portion of the island of Madeira. It is linked by road from Funchal (the regional capital), to the Santana and the villages of Ribeira Seca and [[Cani\u00e7al]].  To the existence of mountains on the western coast, it is sandwiched along the coast from the rest of the islands' settlements, while forests lie towards the interior and grasslands cover the north-eastern corner of the municipality.\n\nGeomorphologically, the municipality is dominated by steeped and inclined topography, except in the Machico valley (where slopes are gentle), formed by two mountain ranges: in the east Pico do Facho and to the west the Queimada plateau. Examples of these differences include the area south of Porto da Cruz (in the watershed of Ribeira do Juncal) and in Cani\u00e7al (in the Ribeira da Palmeira watershed).\n\nDue to its location and morphological characteristics, the climate of Madeira is complex, whose difference from place to place is accentuated, even in areas relatively close. Machico temperatures are relatively moderate throughout the year, with variation relatively low (only accentuated between elevations).\n\n===Human geography===\nAdministratively, the municipality is governed from its seat in the city of Machico, but five local ''juntas de freguesia'' (''civil parish government'') handle issues in the communities of:\n* [[\u00c1gua de Pena]] \u2013 supposedly the area explored by Jo\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alos Zarco and his crew after anchoring in Madeira, Pena is the smallest parish in the municipality, and developed from various reconfigurations of the border between Machico and [[Santa Cruz, Madeira|Santa Cruz]], today its population includes 1700 inhabitants (2001 census);\n* [[Cani\u00e7al]] \u2013 an important fishing community of 3893 inhabitants (2001), the parish of Cani\u00e7al (which means ''area of many fishing lines/rods'') extends into the eastern coast of Madeira island to the tip of the cliffs of the promontory/escarpment of [[Ponta de S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o]];\n* '''Machico''' \u2013 historical village, it is the largest parish in terms of population and concentrated residents, with a population of 11,977 (2006 Estimate);\n* [[Porto da Cruz]] \u2013 largest parish in area and the smallest parish in density (2793 inhabitants), whose name was derived from the original discoverers, who fixed a steel cross by the harbour, so that travellers would be able to identify the location;\n* [[Santo Ant\u00f3nio da Serra (Machico)|Santo Ant\u00f3nio da Serra]] \u2013 considered the smallest parish in terms of population (1355 residents), it is also one of the few interior parishes on the island, created from the disharmony between the local authorities (which forced the local governor to divide the original parish between Machico and Santo Cruz).\n\nMachico has several primary schools, junior and senior secondary schools, banks, main post office and public square, along with public beaches.\n\n== Speleology ==\n\nThe Furnas do Cavalum are a group of four cavities located in Machico and named after a local legend about a devil called Cavalum, who was imprisoned in the cave.\n\nThese lava tubes are of great importance allowing a view on the volcanic history of the now inactive island of Madeira, they have also biologic importance as there are several troglobiont living in the cave, including crustaceans, spiders and flies. At least fourteen invertebrates live in these tubes and at least three of them are endemic on Madeira island, one of them exists only in this cave.\n\nFurnas do Cavalum are also part of the cultural heritage of the islanders, as numerous legends are told about the caves. Despite the stories about the devil, the cave was used as a refuge by the locals, namely during violent uprises like the Revolta da Madeira in April 1931.<ref>[http://www.showcaves.com/english/pt/caves/Cavalum.html Furnas do Cavalum]</ref>\n<ref>''Grutas do Cavalum (Machico - Madeira)'', P.

It was after the 14th century, that documents began to refer to Macedo dos Cavaleiros.\n\nAround 1722, King [[John V of Portugal|John V]] designated Macedo as a ''Quinta'', equivalent to a small estate, indicating the size of this region.\n\nThe municipality of Macedo de Cavaleiros was created in 1853, from the administrative remains of Chacim and Corti\u00e7os municipalities, and ten years later the settlement of Macedo was proclaimed a ''vila'' ({{lang-en|town}}). To this time, the space were listed as royal lands, then established by [[John V of Portugal|John V]] for the [[House of Braganza]].<ref name=CMHistoria/>\n\n;Current affairs\nGrowth during the 20th century has been the result of immigration, resulting from the expansion of raillines and interlinking of circulatory avenues in the northeast of Portugal.<ref name=CMHistoria/> A boom in construction and expansion of services was the result of the return of Colonial troops/citizens ({{lang-pt|[[Retornados]]}}) that occurred during the middle of the 20th century.<ref name=CMHistoria/> As a consequence, the town of Macedo de Cavaleiros was elevated to the status of city in 1999.\n\nMacedo de Cavaleiros was formerly served by the [[Tua line]], a [[narrow gauge railway]] running between Bragan\u00e7a and [[Tua Station|Tua]]. The northern part of the line, including Macedo de Cavaleiros station, closed in 1991.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Barragem do Azibo.jpg|thumb|235px|left|The view of the Azibo Protected Landscape, and aspects of the hilltops the circle the communities of Macedo de Cavaleiros]]\n\n===Physical geography===\nThe municipality of Macedo de Cavaleiros is situated in the northeast region of the Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes, within the district of [[Bragan\u00e7a District|Bragan\u00e7a]], limited by the neighbouring administrations of [[Bragan\u00e7a Municipality|Bragan\u00e7a]], [[Vinhais Municipality|Vinhais]], [[Mirandela Municipality|Mirandela]], [[Alf\u00e2ndega da F\u00e9 Municipality|Alf\u00e2ndega da F\u00e9]], [[Mogadouro Municipality|Mogadouro]] and [[Vimioso Municipality|Vimioso]].<ref name=NDOuro/> It occupies the central part of the district, in a transitional zone between the distinctly different ''Terra Fria'' (''Cold Lands'') and ''Terra Quente'' (''Hot Lands'').<ref name=NDOuro/> The median altitude in the municipality is between 600 and 700 metres, marked in the north by the Serra de Nogueira, in the centre by the Serra de Ala and Serra do Cubo, and in the south by the Serra de Bornes and the Monte de Morais.<ref name=CMHistoria/><ref name=\"C\u00e2mara Municipal 2008, p.4\">{{citation|url=http://www.cm-macedodecavaleiros.pt/files/2/documentos/20080110132604120416.pdf|editor=C\u00e2mara Municipal|location=Macedo de Cavaleiro, Portugal|publisher=C\u00e2mara Municipal do Macedo de Cavaleiro|language=Portuguese|year=2008|title=\u00cdndice: C\u00e3mara Municipal de Macedo de Cavaleiro|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331012208/http://www.cm-macedodecavaleiros.pt/files/2/documentos/20080110132604120416.pdf|archivedate=31 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n====Ecoregion/Protected areas====\nA vast part of the municipality (24.4%) is incorporated within the [[Natura 2000]] initiative, with particular reference to the Morais Massif, considered the ''\"umbigo do mundo\"'' ({{lang-pt|bellybutton of the world}}), due to the number of rare plant species.<ref name=CMHistoria/> The Morais Massif occupies approximately {{convert|12878|ha|sqmi}}; it is serpentine geomorphological space with important geological and biological qualities.
