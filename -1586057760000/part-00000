D. Maunder and Her Two Cameras]]\nIn 1897, Annie received a grant from [[Girton College, Cambridge|Girton College]] to acquire a short-focus [[camera]] with a 1.5-inch lens which she took on expeditions.<ref name=\"bruck1994\" /><ref name=\"ogilvie2000\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> The lens used was made by [[Thomas Rudolphus Dallmeyer|T.R.

/><ref name=\":1\" /> In May 1901, the Maunders went on a solar expedition in [[Mauritius]] in which Annie was not included as an official observer (though her husband [[Edward Walter Maunder|Walter]] was) and had to pay her own way.<ref name=\"bruck1994\" /><ref name=\"ogilvie2000\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> Since Annie was not an official observer, she decided to go to a separate location to photograph the eclipse.<ref name=\":5\" /> Of the two [[Mauritius]] corona photographs that were published, one was [[Edward Walter Maunder|Walter's]] and one was Annie's.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref

/><ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==== The Maunders' Publications ====\nIn 1904, Annie and Walter created the [[Solar cycle|butterfly diagram]] to analyse sunspots, showing the latitude of the sunspots over time.<ref name=\"bruck1994\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":6\" /> The butterfly diagram \u201cis one of the most powerful representations of the inner workings of the Sun\u201d.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> The paper originally had two desiccated butterflies but a third was added after the 11 to 12-year course.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":7\" /> Annie was not published as coauthor on her husbands paper over the butterfly diagram.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 1943 [[Sydney Chapman (mathematician)|Sydney Chapman]], President of the Royal Society used the butterfly diagram as the subject of his 1943 presidential address, an honor for something she considered as her \u201cmost cherished pieces of work\u201d.<ref name=\":5\" /> The butterfly diagram is currently in the [[High Altitude Observatory]].<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":7\" /> Annie gave the butterfly diagram to [[Walter Orr Roberts]] (the director of High Altitude Observatory) during the [[World War II|Second World War]].<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nAnnie co-authored with her husband on some papers.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 1907, she published a paper covering \u201can analysis of the formidable sunspot data-set that had been gathered at the ROG, covering 1889\u20131901\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> as sole author.<ref name=\":0\" /> This analysis contained data that took 13 years to collect, and 19 tables of results.<ref name=\":0\" /> In this paper she found east-west asymmetries, a controversial finding, in sunspots which she could not explain.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> Years later, [[Arthur Schuster]], a famous physicist, confirmed her findings and suggested an explanation for the asymmetry.<ref name=\":0\" /> Modern science and data has also confirmed her observations on the asymmetrical nature of the sunspots.<ref name=\":0\" /> Annie published ''The Heavens and their Story'' in 1908, with her husband Walter as co-author.<ref name=\"bruck1994\" /><ref name=\"ogilvie2000\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":7\" /> (She was credited by her husband as the primary author.)<ref name=\"bruck1994\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> The book was written for the amateur readers, containing her photographs of the sun and the [[Milky Way]], in hopes to draw in more people to the field of astronomy.<ref name=\"ogilvie2000\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> The book discusses the sudden terrestrial magnetic storms coinciding with the sunspots rotation period which was seen in the 1898 eclipse in India.<ref name=\"bruck1994\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> The Maunders thought that the magnetic storms were made of positively and negatively charged electrified particles, an \"insight [that] far predates better-known statements on the same matter, and has much in common with our present-day understanding\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Annie's Fellowship at the Royal Astronomical Society ====\nShe was elected as a Fellow of the [[Royal Astronomical

and had to pay her own way.<ref name=\"bruck1994\" /><ref name=\"ogilvie2000\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> Since Annie was not an official observer, she decided to go to a separate location to photograph

currently in the [[High Altitude Observatory]].<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":7\" /> Annie gave the butterfly diagram to [[Walter Orr Roberts]] (the director of High Altitude Observatory) during the [[World War II|Second World War]].<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nAnnie co-authored with her husband on some papers.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 1907, she published a paper covering \u201can analysis of the formidable sunspot data-set that had been gathered at the ROG, covering 1889\u20131901\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> as sole author.<ref name=\":0\" /> This analysis contained data that took 13 years to collect, and 19 tables of results.<ref name=\":0\" /> In this paper she found east-west asymmetries, a controversial finding, in sunspots which she could not explain.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> Years later, [[Arthur Schuster]], a famous physicist, confirmed her findings and suggested an explanation for the asymmetry.<ref name=\":0\" /> Modern science and data has also confirmed her observations on the asymmetrical nature of the sunspots.<ref name=\":0\" /> Annie published ''The Heavens and their Story'' in 1908, with her husband Walter as co-author.<ref

was written for the amateur readers, containing her photographs of the sun and the [[Milky Way]], in hopes to draw in more people to the field of astronomy.<ref name=\"ogilvie2000\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> The book discusses the sudden terrestrial magnetic storms coinciding with the sunspots rotation period which was seen in the 1898 eclipse in India.<ref name=\"bruck1994\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> The Maunders thought that the magnetic storms were made of positively and negatively charged electrified particles, an \"insight [that] far predates better-known statements on the same matter, and has

If the rule defines the set of goods and services whose production and distribution is prohibited by law, non-compliance with the rule constitutes a black market trade since the transaction itself is illegal. Parties engaging in the production or distribution of prohibited goods and services are members of the illegal economy. Examples include the drug trade, prostitution (where prohibited), illegal currency transactions and human trafficking. Violations of the tax code involving income tax evasion constitute membership in the unreported economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/06rastg12methods.pdf|title=Internal Revenue Service Summary of Estimation Methods|author=|date=|website=irs.gov}}</ref><ref name=\"feige\">{{cite book|author=Edgar L.

These underground economies are omnipresent, existing in market oriented as well as in centrally planned nations, be they developed or developing. Those engaged in underground activities circumvent, escape or are excluded from the institutional system of rules, rights, regulations and enforcement penalties that govern formal agents engaged in production and exchange. Different types of underground activities are distinguished according to the particular institutional rules that they violate. Four major underground economies can be identified:<ref name=Feige /><ref name=\"Feige 2016\">{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Meaning and Measurement of Unobserved Economies: What do we really know about the \"Shadow Economy\"?|last = Feige|first = Edgar L.|date = 2016|journal = Journal of Tax Administration |doi = |pmid = |access-date = | issue = 30/1}}</ref>\n\n# the illegal economy\n# the unreported economy\n# the unrecorded economy\n# the informal economy\n\nThe \"illegal economy\" consists of the income produced by those economic activities pursued in violation of legal statutes defining the scope of legitimate forms of commerce.

A summary measure of the unreported economy is the amount of income that should be reported to the tax authority but is not so reported. A complementary measure of the unreported economy is the \"[[tax gap]]\", namely the difference between the amount of tax revenues due the fiscal authority and the amount of tax revenue actually collected. In the U.S. unreported income is estimated to be $2 trillion resulting in a \"tax gap\" of $450\u2013$600 billion.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/29672.html |title=America's Underground Economy: Measuring the Size, Growth and Determinants of Income Tax Evasion in the U.S.|author1=Feige, Edgar L. |author2=Cebula, Richard |lastauthoramp=yes |date=January 2011|accessdate=2012-03-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/19564.html |title=New estimates of overseas U.S. currency holdings, the Underground economy and the \"Tax Gap\" |author=Feige, Edgar L. |date=September 2009 |accessdate=2012-03-05}}</ref>\n\nThe \"unrecorded economy\" consists of those economic activities that circumvent the institutional rules that define the reporting requirements of government statistical agencies.<ref name=\"Feige 2016\"/> A summary measure of the unrecorded economy is the amount of unrecorded income, namely the amount of income that should (under existing rules and conventions) be recorded in national accounting systems (e.g. [[National Income and Product Accounts]]) but is not.

The [[Fence (criminal)|supplier]] does not have to pay for production costs and/or taxes. This is usually the case in the underground economy. Criminals steal goods and sell them below the legal market price, but there is no receipt, guarantee, and so forth. When someone is hired to perform work and the client is unable to write off the expense (particularly common for work such as [[home renovation]]s or [[Cosmetology|cosmetological]] services), the client may be inclined to request a lower price (usually paid in cash) in exchange for foregoing a receipt, which enables the service provider to avoid reporting the income on his or her tax return.\n* They may be more expensive than legal market prices. For example, the product is difficult to acquire or produce, dangerous to handle, is strictly rationed, or not easily available legally if at all. If exchange of goods are made illegal by some sort of [[state (polity)|state]] sanction, such as is often seen with certain pharmaceutical drugs, their prices will tend to rise as a result of that sanction.\n\n==Consumer issues==\n\n{|class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:25em; max-width: 25%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"|No government, no global nonprofit, no multinational enterprise can seriously claim to be able to replace the 1.8 billion jobs created by the economic underground.

Many people nonetheless continue to use illegal drugs, and a black market exists to supply them. Despite law enforcement efforts to intercept them, demand remains high, providing a large [[profit motive]] for [[organized crime|organized criminal groups]] to keep drugs supplied. The United Nations has reported that the retail market value of illegal drugs is $321.6 billion USD.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/world_drug_report_2005.html |title=World Drug Report 2005 |work=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720100713/http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/world_drug_report_2005.html |archivedate=2006-07-20 |accessdate=2012-03-05}}</ref>\n\nAlthough law enforcement agencies intercept a fraction of the illegal drugs, and incarcerate hundreds of thousands of wholesale and retail sellers, the very stable demand for such drugs and the high profit margins encourages new distributors to enter the market without a decrease in the retail price. Many [[drug legalization]] activists draw parallels between the illegal drug trade and the [[Prohibition]] of alcohol in the United States in the 1920s.\n\n===Weapons===\n{{Main|Arms trafficking}}\n[[Image:Gun pyre in Uhuru Gardens, Nairobi.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A tower of confiscated smuggled weapons about to be set ablaze in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]]]]\nThe [[legislatures]] of many countries forbid or restrict the personal [[ownership]] of [[weapon]]s. These restrictions can range from small [[combat knife|knives]] to [[firearms]], either altogether or by classification (e.g. [[caliber]], [[handgun]]s, [[automatic weapon]]s, and [[explosives]]). The black market supplies the demands for weaponry that can not be obtained legally, or may only be obtained legally after obtaining permits and paying fees. This may be by [[smuggling]] the arms from countries where they were bought legally or stolen, or by stealing from arms manufacturers within the country itself, using [[insider]]s. In cases where the underground economy is unable to smuggle firearms, they can also satisfy requests by [[gunsmith]]ing their own firearms. Those who may buy this way include [[criminals]] to use for illegal activities, gun collectors, and otherwise law-abiding citizens interested in protecting their dwellings, families or businesses.\n\nIn England and Wales, certain categories of weapons used for hunting may be owned by qualified residents but must be registered with the local police force and kept within a locked cabinet. Another segment of the population who may purchase weapons on the black market are individuals who are unable to pass the legal requirements for registration\u2014convicted felons or those suffering from mental illness for example. In a few jurisdictions, collectors may legally keep antique weapons made incapable of being readily restored to a firing condition.\n\n===Illegally logged timber===\n{{Main|Illegal logging}}\nThe illegal logging of [[timber]] has posed as an issue.

Smuggling is usually done to circumvent [[tax]]ation or [[prohibition]] laws within a particular jurisdiction. The term ''rum-running'' is more commonly applied to smuggling over water; ''bootlegging'' is applied to smuggling over land. According to the [[PBS]] documentary ''[[Prohibition (miniseries)|Prohibition]]'', the term \"bootlegging\" was popularized when thousands of city dwellers would sell liquor from flasks they kept in their boot leg all across major cities and rural areas.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Murphy | first1 = Mary | title = Bootlegging Mothers and Drinking Daughters: Gender and Prohibition in Butte Montana | url = | journal = [[American Quarterly]] | volume = 46 | issue = 2| pages = 174\u2013194 | year = 1994 | doi = 10.2307/2713337 | jstor = 2713337 }}</ref><ref>[[Prohibition (miniseries)]], Episode 1, \"A Nation of Drunkards\".

But [[rum]]'s cheapness made it a low-profit item for the rum-runners, and they soon moved on to smuggling [[Canadian whisky]], French [[champagne]], and English [[gin]] to major cities like [[New York City]] and [[Boston]], where prices ran high.

Conducting a racket is racketeering.<ref>{{cite dictionary| url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/racketeering|title= Racketeering|dictionary=Dictionary.com|accessdate=2012-06-29}}</ref> Particularly, the potential problem may be caused by the same party that offers to solve it, although that fact may be concealed, with the specific intent to engender continual patronage for this party. An archetype is the [[protection racket]], wherein a person or group (e.g., a criminal gang) indicates to a store owner that they could protect her/his store from potential damage, damage that the same person or group would otherwise inflict, while the correlation of threat and protection may be more or less deniably veiled, distinguishing it from the more direct act of [[extortion]].\nRacketeering is often associated with [[organized crime]], and the term was coined by the [[Employers' Association of Greater Chicago|Employers' Association of Chicago]] in June 1927 in a statement about the influence of organized crime in the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters|Teamsters]] union.<ref>David Witwer, \"'The Most Racketeer-Ridden Union in America': The Problem of Corruption in the Teamsters Union During the 1930s\", in {{cite book |first2=William Chester, Ed. |last2=Jordan |title=Corrupt histories |location=Rochester, New York |first1=Emmanuel, Ed. |last1=Kreike |publisher=[[University of Rochester Press]] |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-58046-173-3}}</ref>\n\n===Transportation providers===\n{{main|illegal taxicab operation}}\nWhere taxicabs, buses, and other transportation providers are strictly regulated or monopolized by government, a black market typically flourishes to provide transportation to poorly served or overpriced communities. In the United States, some cities restrict entry to the taxicab market with a medallion system, i.e., taxicabs must get a special license and display it on a medallion in the vehicle. In most such jurisdictions it is legal to sell the medallions, but the limited supply and resulting high prices of medallions have led to a market in unlicensed [[carpooling]]/[[illegal taxicab operation]]. In [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], for example, it is not uncommon for private individuals to provide illegal taxicab service<ref name=\"Baltimore\"/> for city residents.\n\n===Housing rental===\nIn places where there is [[rent control]] there may be a black market for housing. For instance, in the UK there is illegal [[Lease#Sublease|subletting]] of [[social housing]] homes where the tenant illegally rents out the home at a higher rent.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/panorama/hi/front_page/newsid_9474000/9474045.stm Tracking down England's council house sublet cheats], ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'', BBC, May 4, 2011</ref> In Sweden, rental contracts with regulated rent can be bought on the black market,<ref>[http://www.thelocal.se/20100830/28666 'Egalitarian' Stockholm rents feed black market], ''[[The Local]]'', August 30, 2010</ref> either from the current tenant or sometimes directly from the property owner.

A determined counterfeiter with a few hundred dollars can make copies that are digitally identical to an original and face no loss in quality; innovations in consumer [[DVD]] and [[CD]] writers and the widespread availability of [[software cracking|cracks]] on the [[Internet]] for most forms of [[copy protection]] technology make this cheap and easy to do.\n\nCopyright-holders and other proponents of copyright laws have found this phenomenon hard to stop through the courts, as the operations are distributed and widespread,{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} transversing national borders and thus legal systems. Since digital information can be duplicated repeatedly with no loss of quality, and passed on electronically at little to no cost, the effective underground market value of media is zero, differentiating it from nearly all other forms of underground economic activity. The issue is compounded by widespread indifference to enforcing copyright law, both with governments and the public at large. To steal a car is seen as a crime in most people's eyes, but to obtain unauthorized copies of music or a game is not.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.applelinks.com/mooresviews/pirate.shtml |title=Is music piracy stealing? |author=Charles W.

It also authorises copyright-holders to use [[DVD region codes|region-coding]] to discriminate against selected populations price-wise and availability-wise.\n\nThe comparison to car-theft, although common, is not truly analogous. Automobile theft results in an item being removed from the owner with the ownership transferred to a second party. Media piracy is a crime of duplication, with no physical property being stolen. Copyright infringement law goes as far as to deem illegal \"[[mixtape]]s\" and other such material copied to tape or disk. Copyright holders typically attest the act of theft to be in the profits forgone to the pirates. However, this makes the unsubstantiated assumption that the pirates would have bought the copyrighted material if it had not been available through [[file sharing]] or other means. Copyright holders also say that they did some work for creating their copyrighted material and they wish to get compensated for their work. No other system than copyright has been found to compensate the artists and other creators for their work{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}, and many artists do not have any alternative source of income or another job.

This may happen for one or more of several reasons:\n* The government sets (\"pegs\") the local currency at some arbitrary level to another currency that does not reflect its true market value.\n* A government makes it difficult or illegal for its citizens to own much or any foreign currency.\n* The government taxes exchanging the local currency with other currencies, either in one direction or both (e.g. foreigners are taxed to buy local currency, or residents are taxed to buy foreign currency).\n* The currency is [[Counterfeit money|counterfeit]].\n* The currency has been acquired illegally and needs to be [[money laundering|laundered]] before the money can be used.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/drugs/special/blackpeso.html |title=Drug Wars: Special Reports: The Black Peso Money Laudering System |work=PBS Frontline |author1=Oriana Zill |author2=Lowell Bergman |lastauthoramp=yes |accessdate=2012-03-06}}</ref>\n\nA government may officially set the rate of exchange of its currency with that of other currencies, typically the [[US dollar]]. When it does, the peg often overvalues the local currency relative to what its market value would be if it were a [[floating currency]]. Those in possession of the \"harder\" currency, for example [[expatriate]] workers, may be able to use the black market to buy the local currency at better exchange rates than they can get officially.\n\nIn situations of financial instability and inflation, citizens may substitute a foreign currency for the local currency.

See also the example of the [[Ghanaian cedi]] from the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nIf foreign currency is difficult or illegal for local citizens to acquire, they will pay a premium to acquire it. U.S. currency is viewed as a relatively stable store of value and since it does not leave a paper trail,{{Dubious|reason=serial numbers|date=March 2012}} it is also a convenient medium of exchange for both illegal transactions and for [[tax evasion|unreported income]] both in the U.S and abroad.<ref name=\"Cebula and Feige\">{{cite journal |url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/29672.html |title=America's Underground Economy: Measuring the Size, Growth and Determinants of Income Tax Evasion in the U.S. |author1=Feige, Edgar L. |author2=Cebula, Richard |lastauthoramp=yes |date=January 2011|accessdate=2012-03-05}}</ref>\n\nMore recently [[cryptocurrency|cryptocurrencies]] such as [[bitcoin]] have been used as medium of exchange in black market transactions.

This is known as [[fuel dyes|dyed fuel]], because a coloured dye is added so it can be detected if used in other vehicles (e.g. a red dye in the UK, a green dye in Ireland). Nevertheless, the saving is attractive enough to make a black market in agricultural diesel. In 2007 it was estimated that \u00a3350 million was not gained in profit as a result of this phenomenon, in the UK.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=[[What Car?]] |publisher=[[Haymarket Group]] |title=Red diesel abuse costs UK millions |date=November 7, 2007 |url=http://www.whatcar.com/car-news/red-diesel-abuse-costs-uk-millions/229086 |accessdate=2012-03-06}}</ref>\n\nIn countries like India and Nepal, the price of fuel is set by the government, and it is illegal to sell the fuel over the set price. Due to the petrol crisis in Nepal, black marketing in fuel has been a common trend, especially during mass petrol shortage. At times, people need to queue for hours or even sometimes overnight to get the fuel. On the other hand, the petrol pump operators are alleged to hoarding the fuel, and selling it to black marketers. Black marketing in vehicle/cooking fuel became widespread during the [[2015 Nepal blockade|2015 economic blockade]] imposed on Nepal. Even after the economic blockade was eased, and petrol imports resumed, people are not getting the fuel as they were supposed to and are resort to buying from the black market.\n\n===Sex toys===\nThere are some countries where sex toys are illegal, such as Saudi Arabia, Thailand and India. The illegality has omitted certain clearing processes such as safety testing when they are sold by undercover independent vendors on the black market.

States that are engaged in [[total war]] or other large-scale, extended [[war]]s often impose restrictions on home use of critical resources that are needed for the war effort, such as [[food]], [[gasoline]], [[rubber]], [[metal]], etc., typically through [[rationing]]. In most cases, a black market develops to supply rationed goods at exorbitant prices. The [[rationing]] and [[price controls]] enforced in many countries during [[World War II]] encouraged widespread black market activity.<ref name=\"TheHomeFront\">{{cite book |title=The Home Front|date=July 1945|isbn=978-1-904897-11-8|publisher=Imperial War Museum|location=London|edition=facsimile}}</ref> One source of black-market meat under wartime rationing was by farmers declaring fewer domestic animal births to the [[Minister of Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Food]] than actually happened.

Also if a Vietnamese civilian wanted something that was hard to get, he would buy it at double the price from one of the soldiers, who had a monthly ration card and thus had access to the military stores.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} The transactions ran through the on-base maids to the local populace. Although these activities were illegal, only flagrant or large-scale black-marketeers were prosecuted by the military.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\n===Laws and regulations===\nA classic example of new regulation creating a black market is the [[prohibition]] of alcohol.

If the rule defines the set of goods and services whose production and distribution is prohibited by law, non-compliance with the rule constitutes a black market trade since the transaction itself is illegal. Parties engaging in the production or distribution of prohibited goods and services are members of the illegal economy. Examples include the drug trade, prostitution (where prohibited), illegal currency transactions and human trafficking. Violations of the tax code involving income tax evasion constitute membership in the unreported economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/06rastg12methods.pdf|title=Internal Revenue Service Summary of Estimation Methods|author=|date=|website=irs.gov}}</ref><ref name=\"feige\">{{cite book|author=Edgar L.

These underground economies are omnipresent, existing in market oriented as well as in centrally planned nations, be they developed or developing. Those engaged in underground activities circumvent, escape or are excluded from the institutional system of rules, rights, regulations and enforcement penalties that govern formal agents engaged in production and exchange. Different types of underground activities are distinguished according to the particular institutional rules that they violate. Four major underground economies can be identified:<ref name=Feige /><ref name=\"Feige 2016\">{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Meaning and Measurement of Unobserved Economies: What do we really know about the \"Shadow Economy\"?|last = Feige|first = Edgar L.|date = 2016|journal = Journal of Tax Administration |doi = |pmid = |access-date = | issue = 30/1}}</ref>\n\n# the illegal economy\n# the unreported economy\n# the unrecorded economy\n# the informal economy\n\nThe \"illegal economy\" consists of the income produced by those economic activities pursued in violation of legal statutes defining the scope of legitimate forms of commerce.

A summary measure of the unreported economy is the amount of income that should be reported to the tax authority but is not so reported. A complementary measure of the unreported economy is the \"[[tax gap]]\", namely the difference between the amount of tax revenues due the fiscal authority and the amount of tax revenue actually collected. In the U.S. unreported income is estimated to be $2 trillion resulting in a \"tax gap\" of $450\u2013$600 billion.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/29672.html |title=America's Underground Economy: Measuring the Size, Growth and Determinants of Income Tax Evasion in the U.S.|author1=Feige, Edgar L. |author2=Cebula, Richard |lastauthoramp=yes |date=January 2011|accessdate=2012-03-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/19564.html |title=New estimates of overseas U.S. currency holdings, the Underground economy and the \"Tax Gap\" |author=Feige, Edgar L. |date=September 2009 |accessdate=2012-03-05}}</ref>\n\nThe \"unrecorded economy\" consists of those economic activities that circumvent the institutional rules that define the reporting requirements of government statistical agencies.<ref name=\"Feige 2016\"/> A summary measure of the unrecorded economy is the amount of unrecorded income, namely the amount of income that should (under existing rules and conventions) be recorded in national accounting systems (e.g. [[National Income and Product Accounts]]) but is not.

The [[Fence (criminal)|supplier]] does not have to pay for production costs and/or taxes. This is usually the case in the underground economy. Criminals steal goods and sell them below the legal market price, but there is no receipt, guarantee, and so forth. When someone is hired to perform work and the client is unable to write off the expense (particularly common for work such as [[home renovation]]s or [[Cosmetology|cosmetological]] services), the client may be inclined to request a lower price (usually paid in cash) in exchange for foregoing a receipt, which enables the service provider to avoid reporting the income on his or her tax return.\n* They may be more expensive than legal market prices. For example, the product is difficult to acquire or produce, dangerous to handle, is strictly rationed, or not easily available legally if at all. If exchange of goods are made illegal by some sort of [[state (polity)|state]] sanction, such as is often seen with certain pharmaceutical drugs, their prices will tend to rise as a result of that sanction.\n\n==Consumer issues==\n\n{|class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:25em; max-width: 25%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"|No government, no global nonprofit, no multinational enterprise can seriously claim to be able to replace the 1.8 billion jobs created by the economic underground.

In countries such as [[Germany]] or the [[Netherlands]], where prostitution is legal but regulated, illegal prostitutes exist whose services are offered cheaper without regard for the legal requirements or procedures\u2014health checks, standards of accommodation, and so on.\n\nIn other countries, such as [[Nicaragua]], where legal prostitution is regulated, hotels may require both parties to identify themselves, to prevent the rise of [[child prostitution]].\n\n===Personal information===\n[[Personally identifying information]], financial information like credit card and bank account information, and [[Medical data breach|medical data]] is bought and sold, mostly in [[darknet market]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Holt |first1=Thomas J. |last2=Smirnova |first2=Olga |last3=Chua |first3=Yi-Ting |title=Data thieves in action : examining the international market for stolen personal information |date=2016 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-1-137-58904-0}}</ref> People increase the value of the stolen data by aggregating it with publicly available data, and sell it again for a profit, increasing the damage that can be done to the people whose data was stolen.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Rossi |first1=Ben |title=The ripple effect of identity theft: What happens to my data once it's stolen?|url=https://www.information-age.com/ripple-effect-identity-theft-what-happens-my-data-once-its-stolen-123459795/ |work=Information Age |date=8 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Illegal drugs===\n[[File:Yellow Cannabis strain.jpg|thumb|left|In the U.S., [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] has been termed as a [[cash crop]].]]\n{{Main|Illegal drug trade}}\nFrom the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many countries began to ban the keeping or using of some [[recreational drug]]s, such as the United States' [[war on drugs]]. Many people nonetheless continue to use illegal drugs, and a black market exists to supply them. Despite law enforcement efforts to intercept them, demand remains high, providing a large [[profit motive]] for [[organized crime|organized criminal groups]] to keep drugs supplied. The United Nations has reported that the retail market value of illegal drugs is $321.6 billion USD.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/world_drug_report_2005.html |title=World Drug Report 2005 |work=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720100713/http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/world_drug_report_2005.html |archivedate=2006-07-20 |accessdate=2012-03-05}}</ref>\n\nAlthough law enforcement agencies intercept a fraction of the illegal drugs, and incarcerate hundreds of thousands of wholesale and retail sellers, the very stable demand for such drugs and the high profit margins encourages new distributors to enter the market without a decrease in the retail price.

These restrictions can range from small [[combat knife|knives]] to [[firearms]], either altogether or by classification (e.g. [[caliber]], [[handgun]]s, [[automatic weapon]]s, and [[explosives]]). The black market supplies the demands for weaponry that can not be obtained legally, or may only be obtained legally after obtaining permits and paying fees. This may be by [[smuggling]] the arms from countries where they were bought legally or stolen, or by stealing from arms manufacturers within the country itself, using [[insider]]s. In cases where the underground economy is unable to smuggle firearms, they can also satisfy requests by [[gunsmith]]ing their own firearms. Those who may buy this way include [[criminals]] to use for illegal activities, gun collectors, and otherwise law-abiding citizens interested in protecting their dwellings, families or businesses.\n\nIn England and Wales, certain categories of weapons used for hunting may be owned by qualified residents but must be registered with the local police force and kept within a locked cabinet. Another segment of the population who may purchase weapons on the black market are individuals who are unable to pass the legal requirements for registration\u2014convicted felons or those suffering from mental illness for example. In a few jurisdictions, collectors may legally keep antique weapons made incapable of being readily restored to a firing condition.\n\n===Illegally logged timber===\n{{Main|Illegal logging}}\nThe illegal logging of [[timber]] has posed as an issue.

Smuggling is usually done to circumvent [[tax]]ation or [[prohibition]] laws within a particular jurisdiction. The term ''rum-running'' is more commonly applied to smuggling over water; ''bootlegging'' is applied to smuggling over land.

But [[rum]]'s cheapness made it a low-profit item for the rum-runners, and they soon moved on to smuggling [[Canadian whisky]], French [[champagne]], and English [[gin]] to major cities like [[New York City]] and [[Boston]], where prices ran high.

Conducting a racket is racketeering.<ref>{{cite dictionary| url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/racketeering|title= Racketeering|dictionary=Dictionary.com|accessdate=2012-06-29}}</ref> Particularly, the potential problem may be caused by the same party that offers to solve it, although that fact may be concealed, with the specific intent to engender continual patronage for this party. An archetype is the [[protection racket]], wherein a person or group (e.g., a criminal gang) indicates to a store owner that they could protect her/his store from potential damage, damage that the same person or group would otherwise inflict, while the correlation of threat and protection may be more or less deniably veiled, distinguishing it from the more direct act of [[extortion]].\nRacketeering is often associated with [[organized crime]], and the term was coined by the [[Employers' Association of Greater Chicago|Employers' Association of Chicago]] in June 1927 in a statement about the influence of organized crime in the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters|Teamsters]] union.<ref>David Witwer, \"'The Most Racketeer-Ridden Union in America': The Problem of Corruption in the Teamsters Union During the 1930s\", in {{cite book |first2=William Chester, Ed. |last2=Jordan |title=Corrupt histories |location=Rochester, New York |first1=Emmanuel, Ed. |last1=Kreike |publisher=[[University of Rochester Press]] |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-58046-173-3}}</ref>\n\n===Transportation providers===\n{{main|illegal taxicab operation}}\nWhere taxicabs, buses, and other transportation providers are strictly regulated or monopolized by government, a black market typically flourishes to provide transportation to poorly served or overpriced communities. In the United States, some cities restrict entry to the taxicab market with a medallion system, i.e., taxicabs must get a special license and display it on a medallion in the vehicle. In most such jurisdictions it is legal to sell the medallions, but the limited supply and resulting high prices of medallions have led to a market in unlicensed [[carpooling]]/[[illegal taxicab operation]]. In [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], for example, it is not uncommon for private individuals to provide illegal taxicab service<ref name=\"Baltimore\"/> for city residents.\n\n===Housing rental===\nIn places where there is [[rent control]] there may be a black market for housing. For instance, in the UK there is illegal [[Lease#Sublease|subletting]] of [[social housing]] homes where the tenant illegally rents out the home at a higher rent.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/panorama/hi/front_page/newsid_9474000/9474045.stm Tracking down England's council house sublet cheats], ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'', BBC, May 4, 2011</ref> In Sweden, rental contracts with regulated rent can be bought on the black market,<ref>[http://www.thelocal.se/20100830/28666 'Egalitarian' Stockholm rents feed black market], ''[[The Local]]'', August 30, 2010</ref> either from the current tenant or sometimes directly from the property owner.

A determined counterfeiter with a few hundred dollars can make copies that are digitally identical to an original and face no loss in quality; innovations in consumer [[DVD]] and [[CD]] writers and the widespread availability of [[software cracking|cracks]] on the [[Internet]] for most forms of [[copy protection]] technology make this cheap and easy to do.\n\nCopyright-holders and other proponents of copyright laws have found this phenomenon hard to stop through the courts, as the operations are distributed and widespread,{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} transversing national borders and thus legal systems. Since digital information can be duplicated repeatedly with no loss of quality, and passed on electronically at little to no cost, the effective underground market value of media is zero, differentiating it from nearly all other forms of underground economic activity. The issue is compounded by widespread indifference to enforcing copyright law, both with governments and the public at large. To steal a car is seen as a crime in most people's eyes, but to obtain unauthorized copies of music or a game is not.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.applelinks.com/mooresviews/pirate.shtml |title=Is music piracy stealing? |author=Charles W.

It also authorises copyright-holders to use [[DVD region codes|region-coding]] to discriminate against selected populations price-wise and availability-wise.\n\nThe comparison to car-theft, although common, is not truly analogous. Automobile theft results in an item being removed from the owner with the ownership transferred to a second party. Media piracy is a crime of duplication, with no physical property being stolen. Copyright infringement law goes as far as to deem illegal \"[[mixtape]]s\" and other such material copied to tape or disk. Copyright holders typically attest the act of theft to be in the profits forgone to the pirates. However, this makes the unsubstantiated assumption that the pirates would have bought the copyrighted material if it had not been available through [[file sharing]] or other means. Copyright holders also say that they did some work for creating their copyrighted material and they wish to get compensated for their work. No other system than copyright has been found to compensate the artists and other creators for their work{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}, and many artists do not have any alternative source of income or another job.

This may happen for one or more of several reasons:\n* The government sets (\"pegs\") the local currency at some arbitrary level to another currency that does not reflect its true market value.\n* A government makes it difficult or illegal for its citizens to own much or any foreign currency.\n* The government taxes exchanging the local currency with other currencies, either in one direction or both (e.g. foreigners are taxed to buy local currency, or residents are taxed to buy foreign currency).\n* The currency is [[Counterfeit money|counterfeit]].\n* The currency has been acquired illegally and needs to be [[money laundering|laundered]] before the money can be used.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/drugs/special/blackpeso.html |title=Drug Wars: Special Reports: The Black Peso Money Laudering System |work=PBS Frontline |author1=Oriana Zill |author2=Lowell Bergman |lastauthoramp=yes |accessdate=2012-03-06}}</ref>\n\nA government may officially set the rate of exchange of its currency with that of other currencies, typically the [[US dollar]]. When it does, the peg often overvalues the local currency relative to what its market value would be if it were a [[floating currency]]. Those in possession of the \"harder\" currency, for example [[expatriate]] workers, may be able to use the black market to buy the local currency at better exchange rates than they can get officially.\n\nIn situations of financial instability and inflation, citizens may substitute a foreign currency for the local currency.

See also the example of the [[Ghanaian cedi]] from the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nIf foreign currency is difficult or illegal for local citizens to acquire, they will pay a premium to acquire it. U.S. currency is viewed as a relatively stable store of value and since it does not leave a paper trail,{{Dubious|reason=serial numbers|date=March 2012}} it is also a convenient medium of exchange for both illegal transactions and for [[tax evasion|unreported income]] both in the U.S and abroad.<ref name=\"Cebula and Feige\">{{cite journal |url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/29672.html |title=America's Underground Economy: Measuring the Size, Growth and Determinants of Income Tax Evasion in the U.S. |author1=Feige, Edgar L. |author2=Cebula, Richard |lastauthoramp=yes |date=January 2011|accessdate=2012-03-05}}</ref>\n\nMore recently [[cryptocurrency|cryptocurrencies]] such as [[bitcoin]] have been used as medium of exchange in black market transactions.

This is known as [[fuel dyes|dyed fuel]], because a coloured dye is added so it can be detected if used in other vehicles (e.g. a red dye in the UK, a green dye in Ireland). Nevertheless, the saving is attractive enough to make a black market in agricultural diesel. In 2007 it was estimated that \u00a3350 million was not gained in profit as a result of this phenomenon, in the UK.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=[[What Car?]] |publisher=[[Haymarket Group]] |title=Red diesel abuse costs UK millions |date=November 7, 2007 |url=http://www.whatcar.com/car-news/red-diesel-abuse-costs-uk-millions/229086 |accessdate=2012-03-06}}</ref>\n\nIn countries like India and Nepal, the price of fuel is set by the government, and it is illegal to sell the fuel over the set price. Due to the petrol crisis in Nepal, black marketing in fuel has been a common trend, especially during mass petrol shortage. At times, people need to queue for hours or even sometimes overnight to get the fuel. On the other hand, the petrol pump operators are alleged to hoarding the fuel, and selling it to black marketers. Black marketing in vehicle/cooking fuel became widespread during the [[2015 Nepal blockade|2015 economic blockade]] imposed on Nepal. Even after the economic blockade was eased, and petrol imports resumed, people are not getting the fuel as they were supposed to and are resort to buying from the black market.\n\n===Sex toys===\nThere are some countries where sex toys are illegal, such as Saudi Arabia, Thailand and India. The illegality has omitted certain clearing processes such as safety testing when they are sold by undercover independent vendors on the black market.

States that are engaged in [[total war]] or other large-scale, extended [[war]]s often impose restrictions on home use of critical resources that are needed for the war effort, such as [[food]], [[gasoline]], [[rubber]], [[metal]], etc., typically through [[rationing]]. In most cases, a black market develops to supply rationed goods at exorbitant prices. The [[rationing]] and [[price controls]] enforced in many countries during [[World War II]] encouraged widespread black market activity.<ref name=\"TheHomeFront\">{{cite book |title=The Home Front|date=July 1945|isbn=978-1-904897-11-8|publisher=Imperial War Museum|location=London|edition=facsimile}}</ref> One source of black-market meat under wartime rationing was by farmers declaring fewer domestic animal births to the [[Minister of Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Food]] than actually happened.

Also if a Vietnamese civilian wanted something that was hard to get, he would buy it at double the price from one of the soldiers, who had a monthly ration card and thus had access to the military stores.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} The transactions ran through the on-base maids to the local populace. Although these activities were illegal, only flagrant or large-scale black-marketeers were prosecuted by the military.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\n===Laws and regulations===\nA classic example of new regulation creating a black market is the [[prohibition]] of alcohol.
