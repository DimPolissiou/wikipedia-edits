The buildings would have been single-storied, made of [[wattle-and-daub]], roofed with turf or thatch \u2013 the latter made from reeds from the banks of the Tay.

These also formed the basis of the peasants' diets. [[Wheat]] was later also grown.<ref name=psns/>\n\nPitmiddle is believe to have had a [[shieling]] on Blacklaw (Black Hill) to the north. By 1609, these had been turned into a sheep farm.<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the [[16th century]], Androu Benbie (possibly Benvie) was living as a [[wright]]. Also, Edmund Jackson was fined ten [[shilling]]s for \"striking the common hird on the [[Sabbath]]\".<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the 17th century, due to a greater survival in documentary evidence, more family names are known. These include: Anderson, Christal, Mores (possibly Morris or Moreis), Morton (possibly Mortoun), Millar, Blair, Mitchell, Whittet, Duncan, Paterson, Ogilvy, Young, Boug, Deucat (possibly Deugatt), Smyth, Christie, Robertson, Matthew, Thom, Gairdner (possibly Gardiner), Bowack (possibly Book, Boug or Boyok), Will, Hall, Muir (possibly Moor or Mure), Pirie (possibly Pierie), Martine and Lawson (possibly Lousone).

They were single storey and thatched. The floors were stone flagged and the fireplaces were built into the gables. The houses were divided into two rooms by box beds. The kitchen fireplace had hooks for kettles and pans. Ashes were kept back by a piece of iron. Around the fireplace was a fender, with a fender stool. The 1861 census showed that all households had two rooms with windows, except John Soutar's farmhouse, which had three. By 1891, there were three families each living in a cottage with three rooms with windows and two families with only one such room, the rest still having two such rooms. Attached to the houses were wooden sheds, [[byre]]s and small gardens. The village's water supply was sourced from three wells.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe rebuilding of the village failed to halt Pitmiddle's demise. A once-thriving community of weavers, a blacksmith, two joiners, a tailor, a butcher and a public house<ref name=scotsman/> was now seeing young people leaving to work in the factories in nearby [[Dundee]] and [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nJust under one hundred people, living in 26 households, made up Pitmiddle's population in 1841.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nIn December 1896, ''[[The Dundee Courier]]'' sent two reporters to Pitmiddle (which had seven families living there at the time) to investigate its living conditions after reports of \"clearance-style\" conditions on the hill.

These also formed the basis of the peasants' diets. [[Wheat]] was later also grown.<ref name=psns/>\n\nPitmiddle is believe to have had a [[shieling]] on Blacklaw (Black Hill) to the north. By 1609, these had been turned into a sheep farm.<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the [[16th century]], Androu Benbie (possibly Benvie) was living as a [[wright]]. Also, Edmund Jackson was fined ten [[shilling]]s for \"striking the common hird on the [[Sabbath]]\".<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the 17th century, due to a greater survival in documentary evidence, more family names are known. These include: Anderson, Christal, Mores (possibly Morris or Moreis), Morton (possibly Mortoun), Millar, Blair, Mitchell, Whittet, Duncan, Paterson, Ogilvy, Young, Boug, Deucat (possibly Deugatt), Smyth, Christie, Robertson, Matthew, Thom, Gairdner (possibly Gardiner), Bowack (possibly Book, Boug or Boyok), Will, Hall, Muir (possibly Moor or Mure), Pirie (possibly Pierie), Martine and Lawson (possibly Lousone). In 1650, there were 19 tenants.<ref name=psns/>\n\n[[File:Pitmiddle_c._1900.jpg|thumb|right|Pitmiddle around 1900, looking north to Gask Hill.<ref>[https://www.peakfinder.org/?lat=56.4531&lng=-3.2264&azi=9&zoom=5&ele=201&binoazi=7.03&binoalt=-14.67&name=Pitmiddle Pitmiddle at PeakFinder]</ref> This view was used to create [https://imgur.com/a/cKtN3x9 a model of the settlement] that was on display at [[Perth Museum and Art Gallery]]]]\n\n[[File:Pitmiddle_sawmill.jpg|thumb|right|Employees of Pitmiddle's sawmill in March 1915]]\n\nEarly in the [[19th century]], the homes at Pitmiddle were rebuilt in stone, seemingly on the site of their timber predecessors. They were single storey and thatched. The floors were stone flagged and the fireplaces were built into the gables. The houses were divided into two rooms by box beds. The kitchen fireplace had hooks for kettles and pans. Ashes were kept back by a piece of iron. Around the fireplace was a fender, with a fender stool. The 1861 census showed that all households had two rooms with windows, except John Soutar's farmhouse, which had three. By 1891, there were three families each living in a cottage with three rooms with windows and two families with only one such room, the rest still having two such rooms. Attached to the houses were wooden sheds, [[byre]]s and small gardens. The village's water supply was sourced from three wells.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe rebuilding of the village failed to halt Pitmiddle's demise. A once-thriving community of weavers, a blacksmith, two joiners, a tailor, a butcher and a public house<ref name=scotsman/> was now seeing young people leaving to work in the factories in nearby [[Dundee]] and [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nJust under one hundred people, living in 26 households, made up Pitmiddle's population in 1841.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nIn December 1896, ''[[The Dundee Courier]]'' sent two reporters to Pitmiddle (which had seven families living there at the time) to investigate its living conditions after reports of \"clearance-style\" conditions on the hill. The reporters visited Maidie Mitchell and her sister, \"two very old ladies,\" who had spent their entire lives in Pitmiddle.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nBy 1897, there were only sixteen inhabitants,<ref>Longforgan news article</ref> exactly half of what there had been six years earlier.<ref>[https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/local/perth-kinross/1035486/long-read-soon-there-will-be-nothing-left-the-sad-story-of-taysides-ghost-village/ \"Tayside's lost village\"] - ''The Courier''</ref>\n\nA [[sawmill]] was active from before 1915.<ref>[https://www.forestry-memories.org.uk/picture/number1104/ \"Pitmiddle Sawmill March 1915\"] - Forestry Memories, 11 April 2012</ref> On an [[Ordnance Survey]] map of 1861, a \"mill dam\" is shown southeast of the settlement, towards today's Guardswell Farm.<ref>[https://i0.wp.com/holeousia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/pitmiddle-village-1861.jpg?ssl=1 Ordnance Survey map, 1861]</ref>\n\nFollowing the breakup of the Inchmartine estate in 1917, Pitmiddle was eventually bought by the White family and farmed from Outfield.

The program's name is a tribute to former Prime Minister and widow of President Zardari, [[Benazir Bhutto]], who was assassinated in 2007.{{Sfn|Shahzad 2011}}\n\nSince 2005, the purchasing power of many Pakistani families has been eroded by high inflation and the increasing cost of food and oil.  BISP arose against this backdrop as a means to address reductions in purchasing power.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}  Along with the economic development aims of the program, BISP also seeks to empower women by presenting cash transfers directly to female members of households.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}\n\nBISP is currently the largest aid program in Pakistan and the government's third largest budgetary allocation.  BISP spending accounts for 0.3% of Pakistan's GDP.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}\n\nIn the 2008\u20132009 fiscal year, more than 3 million Pakistani families received cash transfers through BISP; this figure accounts for 1.5% of the general population{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}} and 10% of the population below the poverty level.  For the 2009\u20132010 fiscal year, the program was expanded to cover 5 million low-income families.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}  At the program's start in 2008, the Pakistani government allocated RS 34&nbsp;billion, or $425&nbsp;million, for BISP; the allocation doubled to RS 70&nbsp;billion, or $875&nbsp;million in the following year.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}\n\nThe Benazir Income Support Programme is planning to launch a new initiative that encourages [[human capital]] development through a [[conditional cash transfer]].  The Waseela-e-Taleem initiative will condition cash payments on primary school enrolment for the children of eligible families.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}} On 18 June 2017, BISP launched an e-commerce platform for its beneficiaries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/millennialpk/pakistans-new-plan-to-eradicate-poverty-use-embroidery-4a14b5cdfac0|title=Pakistan\u2019s New Plan to Eradicate Poverty: Use Embroidery|last=Wani|first=Shahrukh|date=2017-06-18|website=Medium|access-date=2017-06-24}}</ref>\n\n==Program structure==\nThe Benazir Income Support Programme has been implemented in the provinces of [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], [[Sindh]], [[Baluchistan]], and [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber-Pakhtonnkhwa]].  The program also operates in the federally administered regions of [[Azad Jammu and Kashmir]], and the Islamabad Capital Territory.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}\n\nIn its first year of operation, recipients of BISP cash transfers were identified and selected by Parliamentarians through a process of recommendation.  Each Parliamentarian received 8,000 forms to distribute throughout his or her constituency.  Selected individuals underwent an eligibility verification process through the National Database and Registration Authority.  A final list of eligible families was generated and sent to the postal service.  Funds were disbursed from the Treasury directly to the postal service and then delivered to the female head of eligible households.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}\n\nIn April 2009, the process for identifying a selecting eligible families through Parliamentarian recommendation was ended.  The identification process has been reformed and now uses a Poverty Scorecard.  Through the Poverty Scorecard, families are identified through a proxy means test.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}  The Poverty Scorecard has been approved by the World Bank and requires families to answer 13 questions regarding assets and expenses in a survey.{{Sfn|Shahzad 2011}}  The poverty survey has been tested in 16 districts and will be distributed nationwide.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}\n\nInternal monitoring systems are being developed to track deliveries and payment amounts to eligible families.  Another mechanism to address corruption and political favouritism is being considered that would allow a neutral third party access to the list of eligible families to verify eligibility.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}\n\nRecently, BISP has expanded to include several special initiatives.  The Waseela-e-Haq program empowers women through the provision of small loans.  A vocation training program, Waseela-e-Rozgar, offers members of eligible families up to 1 year of professional training.  The Waseela-e-Sehat program provides financial assistance specifically for obtaining basic health care.  BISP will launch its first program that conditions cash payments on schooling. The Waseela-e-Taleem initiative will require families receiving cash payments to enroll children between the ages of 5 to 12 to enroll in primary education.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}\n\nBISP also provides cash payments for emergency relief efforts.  These payments are similar to the payments received by low-income families but are distributed to families affected by terrorism, war, and natural disasters such as earthquakes.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}\n\n==Eligibility==\nTo be eligible for cash payments under BISP, families must earn less than RS 6,000 per month; equivalent to $67.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}  Further eligibility requirements stipulate that:\n*Families must have a female applicant holding a valid ID card\n*An individual applicant must be a widowed or divorced female without male family members\n*Eligible families include those with physically or mentally disabled individuals\n\nFamilies deemed ineligible for cash payments through BISP include those with:{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}\n*Members employed by the Pakistani government, army, or any other government-affiliated agency\n*Members drawing a pension or receiving post-retirement benefits from the government\n*Family members owning more than 3 acres of farmland or more than 80 square yards of residential land\n*Members receiving income from other sources\n*Members holding a machine readable passport\n*Members with a National Identity Card for Overseas citizens\n*Members with a bank account excluding microfinance banks and those catering to low-inc\nome families\n\n==Benefits==\nEligible families receive cash payments of 4834 quarterly.  This amount increases the purchasing power for families earning approximately RS 5,000 each month by 20%.  Most low-income families spend 50\u201370% of total income on food alone.  According to BISP, the cash payment of RS 3,000 every two months, or RS 1,500 each month, will allow a family of 5\u20136 to purchase 20\u201325 days worth of flour.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}\n\n==Criticism==\nSince the program's inception, critics have pointed out several overall flaws in the Benazir Income Support Program design.  Some claim that the amount of RS 3000 bi-monthly, or RS 1,500 per month, is not enough to move impoverished families above the poverty line as this would require RS 2,550 per month.  Another major flaw with BISP is its lack of conditionality.  Conditional cash transfer programs in Latin America have experienced greater degrees of success because recipient families must meet certain requirements before receiving a cash payment.{{Sfn|Shahzad 2011}}  These programs build human capital through requiring recipients to enroll their children in primary education, participate in health and nutrition seminars, and visit health care providers.{{Sfn|Rawlings-Rubio 2003}}  Apart from the Waseela-e-Taleem initiative, cash payments do not require recipients to meet particular obligations in return for cash payments.{{fact|date=October 2018}}\n \nThere have also been accusations of corruption and political favouritism.  By some estimates, only 50\u201360 percent of beneficiaries actually receive cash payments from BISP. The previous method of identifying families through the recommendation of Parliamentarians was flawed.  Many have claimed that Parliamentarians simply recommended their own family and friends to receive cash payments.{{Sfn|Shahzad 2011}}  It has been pointed out that there is a disproportionate number of families receiving BISP aid in geographic areas where the ruling Pakistan People's Party dominates.

The program's name is a tribute to former Prime Minister and widow of President Zardari, [[Benazir Bhutto]], who was assassinated in 2007.{{Sfn|Shahzad 2011}}\n\nSince 2005, the purchasing power of many Pakistani families has been eroded by high inflation and the increasing cost of food and oil.  BISP arose against this backdrop as a means to address reductions in purchasing power.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}  Along with the economic development aims of the program, BISP also seeks to empower women by presenting cash transfers directly to female members of households.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}\n\nBISP is currently the largest aid program in Pakistan and the government's third largest budgetary allocation.  BISP spending accounts for 0.3% of Pakistan's GDP.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}\n\nIn the 2008\u20132009 fiscal year, more than 3 million Pakistani families received cash transfers through BISP; this figure accounts for 1.5% of the general population{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}} and 10% of the population below the poverty level.  For the 2009\u20132010 fiscal year, the program was expanded to cover 5 million low-income families.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}  At the program's start in 2008, the Pakistani government allocated RS 34&nbsp;billion, or $425&nbsp;million, for BISP; the allocation doubled to RS 70&nbsp;billion, or $875&nbsp;million in the following year.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}\n\nThe Benazir Income Support Programme is planning to launch a new initiative that encourages [[human capital]] development through a [[conditional cash transfer]].  The Waseela-e-Taleem initiative will condition cash payments on primary school enrolment for the children of eligible families.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}} On 18 June 2017, BISP launched an e-commerce platform for its beneficiaries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/millennialpk/pakistans-new-plan-to-eradicate-poverty-use-embroidery-4a14b5cdfac0|title=Pakistan\u2019s New Plan to Eradicate Poverty: Use Embroidery|last=Wani|first=Shahrukh|date=2017-06-18|website=Medium|access-date=2017-06-24}}</ref>\n\n==Program structure==\nThe Benazir Income Support Programme has been implemented in the provinces of [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], [[Sindh]], [[Baluchistan]], and [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber-Pakhtonnkhwa]].  The program also operates in the federally administered regions of [[Azad Jammu and Kashmir]], and the Islamabad Capital Territory.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}\n\nIn its first year of operation, recipients of BISP cash transfers were identified and selected by Parliamentarians through a process of recommendation.  Each Parliamentarian received 8,000 forms to distribute throughout his or her constituency.  Selected individuals underwent an eligibility verification process through the National Database and Registration Authority.  A final list of eligible families was generated and sent to the postal service.  Funds were disbursed from the Treasury directly to the postal service and then delivered to the female head of eligible households.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}\n\nIn April 2009, the process for identifying a selecting eligible families through Parliamentarian recommendation was ended.  The identification process has been reformed and now uses a Poverty Scorecard.  Through the Poverty Scorecard, families are identified through a proxy means test.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}  The Poverty Scorecard has been approved by the World Bank and requires families to answer 13 questions regarding assets and expenses in a survey.{{Sfn|Shahzad 2011}}  The poverty survey has been tested in 16 districts and will be distributed nationwide.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}\n\nInternal monitoring systems are being developed to track deliveries and payment amounts to eligible families.  Another mechanism to address corruption and political favouritism is being considered that would allow a neutral third party access to the list of eligible families to verify eligibility.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}\n\nRecently, BISP has expanded to include several special initiatives.  The Waseela-e-Haq program empowers women through the provision of small loans.  A vocation training program, Waseela-e-Rozgar, offers members of eligible families up to 1 year of professional training.  The Waseela-e-Sehat program provides financial assistance specifically for obtaining basic health care.  BISP will launch its first program that conditions cash payments on schooling. The Waseela-e-Taleem initiative will require families receiving cash payments to enroll children between the ages of 5 to 12 to enroll in primary education.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}\n\nBISP also provides cash payments for emergency relief efforts.  These payments are similar to the payments received by low-income families but are distributed to families affected by terrorism, war, and natural disasters such as earthquakes.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}\n\n==Eligibility==\nTo be eligible for cash payments under BISP, families must earn less than RS 6,000 per month; equivalent to $67.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}  Further eligibility requirements stipulate that:\n*Families must have a female applicant holding a valid ID card\n*An individual applicant must be a widowed or divorced female without male family members\n*Eligible families include those with physically or mentally disabled individuals\n\nFamilies deemed ineligible for cash payments through BISP include those with:{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}\n*Members employed by the Pakistani government, army, or any other government-affiliated agency\n*Members drawing a pension or receiving post-retirement benefits from the government\n*Family members owning more than 3 acres of farmland or more than 80 square yards of residential land\n*Members receiving income from other sources\n*Members holding a machine readable passport\n*Members with a National Identity Card for Overseas citizens\n*Members with a bank account excluding microfinance banks and those catering to low-inc\nome families\n\n==Benefits==\nEligible families receive cash payments of 4834 quarterly.  This amount increases the purchasing power for families earning approximately RS 5,000 each month by 20%.  Most low-income families spend 50\u201370% of total income on food alone.  According to BISP, the cash payment of RS 3,000 every two months, or RS 1,500 each month, will allow a family of 5\u20136 to purchase 20\u201325 days worth of flour.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}\n\n==Criticism==\nSince the program's inception, critics have pointed out several overall flaws in the Benazir Income Support Program design.  Some claim that the amount of RS 3000 bi-monthly, or RS 1,500 per month, is not enough to move impoverished families above the poverty line as this would require RS 2,550 per month.  Another major flaw with BISP is its lack of conditionality.  Conditional cash transfer programs in Latin America have experienced greater degrees of success because recipient families must meet certain requirements before receiving a cash payment.{{Sfn|Shahzad 2011}}  These programs build human capital through requiring recipients to enroll their children in primary education, participate in health and nutrition seminars, and visit health care providers.{{Sfn|Rawlings-Rubio 2003}}  Apart from the Waseela-e-Taleem initiative, cash payments do not require recipients to meet particular obligations in return for cash payments.{{fact|date=October 2018}}\n \nThere have also been accusations of corruption and political favouritism.  By some estimates, only 50\u201360 percent of beneficiaries actually receive cash payments from BISP. The previous method of identifying families through the recommendation of Parliamentarians was flawed.  Many have claimed that Parliamentarians simply recommended their own family and friends to receive cash payments.{{Sfn|Shahzad 2011}}  It has been pointed out that there is a disproportionate number of families receiving BISP aid in geographic areas where the ruling Pakistan People's Party dominates.  For example, in the Prime Minister's hometown of Multan, there is twice the number of people receiving BISP payments than in Lahore, the opposition party's stronghold.  Punjab, another area where opposition parties dominate, has the lowest ratio of eligible families\u20141,974 for every 100,000 people; versus 6,829 families for every 100,000 people in Sindh, the ruling party's stronghold.{{Sfn|Ghauri 2012}}  Beneficiaries have also complained that the postal service charges an additional RS 100 to RS 200 for each delivery of payment.{{Sfn|Shahzad 2011}}\n\nOther critics have argued that as the Benazir Income Support Programme makes up a substantial portion of the Pakistani government's budget, impact evaluations should be conducted to evaluate the benefits and actual need for the program.{{Sfn|Shahzad 2011}}\n\n==List of Chairpersons of Benazir Income Support Program==\n{| class=\"wikitable\n|-\n!align=center|Name of Chairperson\n!align=center|Entered Office\n!align=center|Left Office\n|-\n|[[Farzana Raja]]\n|July 2008\n|March 2013\n|-\n|Vacant\n|March 2013\n|November 2013\n|-\n|[[Enver Baig]]\n|November 2013\n|November 2014\n|-\n|Vacant\n|November 2014\n|February 2015\n|-\n|[[Marvi Memon]]\n|February 2015\n|June 2018\n|-\n|Vacant\n|June 2018\n|October 2018\n|-\n|[[Sania Nishtar]]\n|October 2018\n|Present\n|-\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n<!--- After listing your sources please cite them using inline citations and place them after the information they cite.

The last has rarely been out of print since its publication in 1813 and was adapted as the 1926 British film ''[[Nelson (1926 film)|Nelson]]''.\n\nHe was also a renowned scholar of Portuguese and Spanish literature and history, translating a number of works from those two languages into English and writing a ''History of Brazil'' (part of his planned ''History of Portugal'', which he never completed) and a ''History of the Peninsular War''.\n\nPerhaps his most enduring contribution to literary history is the children's classic ''The Story of the Three Bears'', the original [[Goldilocks and the Three Bears|Goldilocks]] story, first published in Southey's prose collection ''The Doctor''. He also wrote on political issues, which led to a brief, non-sitting, spell as a [[Tory Party (UK)|Tory]] Member of Parliament.\n\n==Life==\n[[File:Robert Southey by Sir Francis Chantrey, 1832, National Portrait Gallery, London.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Robert Southey, by Sir [[Francis Chantrey]], 1832, National Gallery, London]]\nRobert Southey was born in Wine Street, [[Bristol]], to Robert Southey and Margaret Hill. He was educated at [[Westminster School]], London (where he was expelled for writing an article in ''The Flagellant'' attributing the invention of flogging to the Devil),<ref>Geoffrey Treasure: ''Who's Who in Late Hanoverian Britain'' (2nd, enlarged edition, London: Shepheard-Walwyn, 1997), p. 143.</ref> and at [[Balliol College]], Oxford.<ref name=\"ODNB\">{{cite web |last=Carnall |first=Geoffrey |title=Southey, Robert (1774\u20131843), poet and reviewer |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26056 |work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |edition=online |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |accessdate=26 August 2012}} {{ODNBsub}}</ref> Southey later said of Oxford, \"All I learnt was a little swimming... and a little boating.\"\n\nExperimenting with a writing partnership with Samuel Taylor Coleridge, most notably in their joint composition of ''[[The Fall of Robespierre]]'', Southey published his first collection of poems in 1794. The same year, Southey, Coleridge, [[Robert Lovell]] and several others discussed creating an idealistic community (\"[[pantisocracy]]\") on the banks of the [[Susquehanna River]] in America:\n{{quote| Their wants would be simple and natural; their toil need not be such as the slaves of luxury endure; where possessions were held in common, each would work for all; in their cottages the best books would have a place; literature and science, bathed anew in the invigorating stream of life and nature, could not but rise reanimated and purified. Each young man should take to himself a mild and lovely woman for his wife; it would be her part to prepare their innocent food, and tend their hardy and beautiful race.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>}}\n\nSouthey was the first to reject the idea as unworkable, suggesting that they move the intended location to [[Wales]], but when they failed to agree, the plan was abandoned.\n\nIn 1799 Southey and Coleridge were involved with early experiments with [[nitrous oxide]] (laughing gas), conducted by the [[Cornish people|Cornish]] scientist [[Humphry Davy]].<ref>[http://www.nndb.com/people/028/000083776/ Humphry Davy], NNDB</ref>\n\n[[File:Illustrirte Zeitung (1843) 06 016 2 Southey's Haus, Gretahof.PNG|thumb|[[Greta Hall]], [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]]]][[File:Matilda Betham, Portrait of Edith May Southey, 1809.jpg|thumb|left|Mary Matilda Betham, ''Portrait of Edith May Southey,'' 1809{{r|Letter 1669}}]][[File:Matilda Betham, Portrait of Herbert Southey, 1809.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mary Matilda Betham]], ''Portrait of Herbert,'' 1809<ref name=\"Letter 1669\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/southey_letters/Part_Three/HTML/letterEEd.26.1669.html |title=Letter 1669.

The Southeys made their home at [[Greta Hall]], [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]], in the [[Lake District]], living on his tiny income. Also living at Greta Hall and supported by him were Sara Coleridge and her three children (after Coleridge abandoned them) and the widow of poet [[Robert Lovell]] and her son.\n\nIn 1808 Southey met [[Walter Savage Landor]], whose work he admired, and they became close friends. That same year he wrote ''Letters from England'' under the pseudonym Don Manuel Alvarez Espriella, an account of a tour supposedly from a foreigner's viewpoint. Through the mouth of his pseudonym Southey is critical of the disparity between the haves and have-nots in English society, arguing that a change in taxation policy would be needed to foster a greater degree of equity.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nFrom 1809 Southey contributed to the ''[[Quarterly Review]]''. He had become so well known by 1813 that he was appointed [[Poet Laureate]] after [[Walter Scott]] refused the post.\n\nIn 1819, through a mutual friend ([[John Rickman]]), Southey met the leading [[civil engineer]] [[Thomas Telford]] and struck up a friendship. From mid-August to 1 October 1819, Southey accompanied Telford on an extensive tour of his engineering projects in the [[Scottish Highlands]], keeping a diary of his observations. This was published in 1929 as ''Journal of a Tour in Scotland in 1819''. He was also a friend of the Dutch poet [[Willem Bilderdijk]], whom he met twice, in 1824 and 1826, at Bilderdijk's home in [[Leiden]]. He expressed appreciation of the work of the English novelist [[Ann Doherty]].<ref>Links to letters [[Romantic Circles]]: \"Attersoll, Ann...\" [https://www.rc.umd.edu/node/103426 Retrieved 11 November 2017.]</ref>\n\nIn 1837 Southey received a letter from [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]], seeking his advice on some of her poems. He wrote back praising her talents, but discouraging her from writing professionally: \"Literature cannot be the business of a woman's life,\" he argued. Years later, Bront\u00eb remarked to a friend that the letter was \"kind and admirable; a little stringent, but it did me good.\"\n\nIn 1838 Edith died and Southey remarried, to [[Caroline Anne Southey|Caroline Anne Bowles]], also a poet, on 4 June 1839.<ref>{{cite web |last= Blain |first=Virginia H. |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26054 |title=Southey, Caroline Anne Bowles (1786\u20131854), poet and writer |work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |edition=online |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |accessdate=}} {{ODNBsub}}</ref> Southey's mind was giving way when he wrote a last letter to his friend Landor in 1839, but he continued to mention Landor's name when generally incapable of mentioning any one. He died on 21 March 1843 and was buried in the churchyard of [[Crosthwaite Parish Church|Crosthwaite Church]], Keswick, where he had worshipped for forty years. There is a memorial to him inside the church, with an epitaph written by his friend, William Wordsworth.\n\nA few of Southey's ballads are still read by British schoolchildren, the best-known being ''[[The Inchcape Rock]]'', ''God's Judgement on a Wicked Bishop'', ''[[After Blenheim]]'' (possibly one of the earliest anti-war poems) and ''[[Cataract of Lodore]]''.\n\nAs a prolific writer and commentator, Southey introduced or popularised a number of words into the English language. The term ''autobiography'', for example, was used by Southey in 1809 in the ''Quarterly Review'', in which he predicted an \"epidemical rage for autobiography\", which indeed has continued to the present day.{{efn|The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' entry for ''autobiography'' contains an earlier quotation using this word.}}\n\n==Politics==\n[[File:Knife-Grinder-Gillray.jpeg|thumb|A 1797 caricature of Southey's early radical poetry]]\nAlthough originally a radical supporter of the [[French Revolution]], Southey followed the trajectory of his fellow Romantic poets Wordsworth and Coleridge towards conservatism. Embraced by the Tory establishment as Poet Laureate, and from 1807 in receipt of a yearly stipend from them, he vigorously supported the [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Liverpool]] government. He argued against parliamentary reform (\"the railroad to ruin with the Devil for driver\"), blamed the [[Peterloo Massacre]] on an allegedly revolutionary \"rabble\" killed and injured by government troops, and spurned Catholic emancipation.<ref>{{cite ODNB |id=26056 |title=Southey, Robert (1774\u20131843) |last1=Carnall |first1=Geoffrey}}</ref> In 1817 he privately proposed [[penal transportation]] for those guilty of \"libel\" or \"sedition\". He had in mind figures like [[Thomas Jonathan Wooler]] and [[William Hone]], whose prosecution he urged. Such writers were guilty, he wrote in the ''Quarterly Review'', of \"inflaming the turbulent temper of the manufacturer and disturbing the quiet attachment of the peasant to those institutions under which he and his fathers have dwelt in peace.\" Wooler and Hone were acquitted, but the threats caused another target, [[William Cobbett]], to emigrate temporarily to the United States.\n\nIn some respects, Southey was ahead of his time in his views on social reform. For example, he was an early critic of the evils the new factory system brought to early 19th-century Britain. He was appalled by the living conditions in towns like [[Birmingham]] and [[Manchester]] and especially by employment of children in factories and outspoken about them. He sympathised with the pioneering socialist plans of [[Robert Owen]], advocated that the state promote public works to maintain high employment, and called for universal education.<ref>Carnall (1971), p. 9.</ref>\n\nGiven his departure from radicalism, and his attempts to have former fellow travellers prosecuted, it is unsurprising that less successful contemporaries who kept the faith attacked Southey. They saw him as selling out for money and respectability.\n\nIn 1817 Southey was confronted with the surreptitious publication of a radical play, ''Wat Tyler'', which he had written in 1794 at the height of his radical period. This was instigated by his enemies in an attempt to embarrass the Poet Laureate and highlight his apostasy from radical poet to supporter of the Tory establishment. One of his most savage critics was [[William Hazlitt]]. In his portrait of Southey, in ''[[The Spirit of the Age]]'', he wrote: \"He wooed Liberty as a youthful lover, but it was perhaps more as a mistress than a bride; and he has since wedded with an elderly and not very reputable lady, called Legitimacy.\" Southey largely ignored his critics but was forced to defend himself when William Smith, a member of Parliament, rose in the House of Commons on 14 March to attack him. In a spirited response Southey wrote an open letter to the MP, in which he explained that he had always aimed at lessening human misery and bettering the condition of all the lower classes and that he had only changed in respect of \"the means by which that amelioration was to be effected.\"<ref name=\"Speck 2006, p. 172\">Speck (2006) p. 172.</ref> As he put it, \"that as he learnt to understand the institutions of his country, he learnt to appreciate them rightly, to love, and to revere, and to defend them.\"<ref name=\"Speck 2006, p. 172\"/>\n\nAnother critic of Southey in his later period was [[Thomas Love Peacock]], who scorned him in the character of Mr. Feathernest in his 1817 satirical novel ''[[Melincourt (novel)|Melincourt]]''.<ref>Howard Mills: ''Peacock, His Circle and His Age'' (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1969) p. 115 ff. [https://books.google.com/books?id=9C9mkMwfyYMC&pg=PA115&lpg=PA115&dq=Peacock+Mr.+Feathernest&source=bl&ots=pNxwgzv2D6&sig=LF3p3d6E0iZOrEAh4b1NE_Tu944&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi7g_ann8ncAhUFkiwKHb9JAX4Q6AEwAHoECAEQAQ#v=onepage&q=Peacock%20Mr.%20Feathernest&f=false Retrieved 31 July 2018.](</ref>\n\nHe was often mocked for what were seen as sycophantic odes to the king, notably in [[Lord Byron|Byron]]'s long ironic dedication of ''[[Don Juan (poem)|Don Juan]]'' to Southey. In the poem Southey is dismissed as insolent, narrow and shabby. This was based both on Byron's disrespect for Southey's literary talent, and his disdain for what he perceived as Southey's hypocritical turn to conservatism later in life. Much of the animosity between the two men can be traced back to Byron's belief that Southey had spread rumours about him and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] being in a \"League of Incest\" during their time on [[Lake Geneva]] in 1816, an accusation that Southey strenuously denied.\n\nIn response, Southey attacked what he called the [[Satanic School]] among modern poets in the preface to his poem, ''A Vision of Judgement'', written after the death of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]]. While not naming Byron, it was clearly directed at him. Byron retaliated with ''[[The Vision of Judgment]]'', a parody of Southey's poem.\n\nWithout his prior knowledge, the [[Jacob Pleydell-Bouverie, 2nd Earl of Radnor|Earl of Radnor]], an admirer of his work, had Southey returned as MP for the latter's [[pocket borough]] seat of [[Downton (UK Parliament constituency)|Downton]] in [[Wiltshire]] at the [[1826 United Kingdom general election|1826 general election]], as an opponent of Catholic emancipation, but Southey refused to sit, causing a by-election in December that year, pleading that he did not have a large enough estate to support him through political life,<ref>MPs were then unsalaried, and expected to treat voters at election times.</ref> or want to take on the hours full attendance required. He wished to continue living in the Lake District and preferred to defend the [[Church of England]] in writing rather than speech. He declared that \"for me to change my scheme of life and go into Parliament, would be to commit a moral and intellectual suicide.\" His friend John Rickman, a Commons clerk, noted that \"prudential reasons would forbid his appearing in London\" as a Member.<ref name=hop>[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1820-1832/member/southey-robert-1774-1843] History of Parliament article.</ref>\n\nIn 1835 Southey declined the offer of a [[baronet]]cy, but accepted a life pension of \u00a3300 a year from Prime Minister [[Sir Robert Peel, 2nd Baronet|Sir Robert Peel]].<ref name=hop/> He is buried in the churchyard of [[Crosthwaite Parish Church]] in [[Cumbria]].\n\n==Honours and memberships==\nSouthey was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1822.<ref>[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlists American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]</ref> He was also a member of the [[Royal Spanish Academy]].\n\n==A partial list of works==\n*''Harold, or, The Castle of Morford'' (an unpublished Robin Hood novel that Southey wrote in 1791).<ref>Bodleian MS.

The English word \"[[zombie]]\", from the [[Haitian French]] \"zombi\", is purported to have first been recorded by Southey in his 1819 essay ''History of Brazil''.\n\n==Achievements==\nSouthey was also a prolific letter writer, literary scholar, essay writer, historian and biographer. His biographies include the life and works of [[John Bunyan]], [[John Wesley]], [[William Cowper]], [[Oliver Cromwell]] and [[Horatio Nelson]]. The last has rarely been out of print since its publication in 1813 and was adapted as the 1926 British film ''[[Nelson (1926 film)|Nelson]]''.\n\nHe was also a renowned scholar of Portuguese and Spanish literature and history, translating a number of works from those two languages into English and writing a ''History of Brazil'' (part of his planned ''History of Portugal'', which he never completed) and a ''History of the Peninsular War''.\n\nPerhaps his most enduring contribution to literary history is the children's classic ''The Story of the Three Bears'', the original [[Goldilocks and the Three Bears|Goldilocks]] story, first published in Southey's prose collection ''The Doctor''. He also wrote on political issues, which led to a brief, non-sitting, spell as a [[Tory Party (UK)|Tory]] Member of Parliament.\n\n==Life==\n[[File:Robert Southey by Sir Francis Chantrey, 1832, National Portrait Gallery, London.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Robert Southey, by Sir [[Francis Chantrey]], 1832, National Gallery, London]]\nRobert Southey was born in Wine Street, [[Bristol]], to Robert Southey and Margaret Hill. He was educated at [[Westminster School]], London (where he was expelled for writing an article in ''The Flagellant'' attributing the invention of flogging to the Devil),<ref>Geoffrey Treasure: ''Who's Who in Late Hanoverian Britain'' (2nd, enlarged edition, London: Shepheard-Walwyn, 1997), p. 143.</ref> and at [[Balliol College]], Oxford.<ref name=\"ODNB\">{{cite web |last=Carnall |first=Geoffrey |title=Southey, Robert (1774\u20131843), poet and reviewer |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26056 |work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |edition=online |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |accessdate=26 August 2012}} {{ODNBsub}}</ref> Southey later said of Oxford, \"All I learnt was a little swimming... and a little boating.\"\n\nExperimenting with a writing partnership with Samuel Taylor Coleridge, most notably in their joint composition of ''[[The Fall of Robespierre]]'', Southey published his first collection of poems in 1794. The same year, Southey, Coleridge, [[Robert Lovell]] and several others discussed creating an idealistic community (\"[[pantisocracy]]\") on the banks of the [[Susquehanna River]] in America:\n{{quote| Their wants would be simple and natural; their toil need not be such as the slaves of luxury endure; where possessions were held in common, each would work for all; in their cottages the best books would have a place; literature and science, bathed anew in the invigorating stream of life and nature, could not but rise reanimated and purified. Each young man should take to himself a mild and lovely woman for his wife; it would be her part to prepare their innocent food, and tend their hardy and beautiful race.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>}}\n\nSouthey was the first to reject the idea as unworkable, suggesting that they move the intended location to [[Wales]], but when they failed to agree, the plan was abandoned.\n\nIn 1799 Southey and Coleridge were involved with early experiments with [[nitrous oxide]] (laughing gas), conducted by the [[Cornish people|Cornish]] scientist [[Humphry Davy]].<ref>[http://www.nndb.com/people/028/000083776/ Humphry Davy], NNDB</ref>\n\n[[File:Illustrirte Zeitung (1843) 06 016 2 Southey's Haus, Gretahof.PNG|thumb|[[Greta Hall]], [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]]]][[File:Matilda Betham, Portrait of Edith May Southey, 1809.jpg|thumb|left|Mary Matilda Betham, ''Portrait of Edith May Southey,'' 1809{{r|Letter 1669}}]][[File:Matilda Betham, Portrait of Herbert Southey, 1809.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mary Matilda Betham]], ''Portrait of Herbert,'' 1809<ref name=\"Letter 1669\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/southey_letters/Part_Three/HTML/letterEEd.26.1669.html |title=Letter 1669.

The Southeys made their home at [[Greta Hall]], [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]], in the [[Lake District]], living on his tiny income. Also living at Greta Hall and supported by him were Sara Coleridge and her three children (after Coleridge abandoned them) and the widow of poet [[Robert Lovell]] and her son.\n\nIn 1808 Southey met [[Walter Savage Landor]], whose work he admired, and they became close friends. That same year he wrote ''Letters from England'' under the pseudonym Don Manuel Alvarez Espriella, an account of a tour supposedly from a foreigner's viewpoint. Through the mouth of his pseudonym Southey is critical of the disparity between the haves and have-nots in English society, arguing that a change in taxation policy would be needed to foster a greater degree of equity.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nFrom 1809 Southey contributed to the ''[[Quarterly Review]]''. He had become so well known by 1813 that he was appointed [[Poet Laureate]] after [[Walter Scott]] refused the post.\n\nIn 1819, through a mutual friend ([[John Rickman]]), Southey met the leading [[civil engineer]] [[Thomas Telford]] and struck up a friendship. From mid-August to 1 October 1819, Southey accompanied Telford on an extensive tour of his engineering projects in the [[Scottish Highlands]], keeping a diary of his observations. This was published in 1929 as ''Journal of a Tour in Scotland in 1819''. He was also a friend of the Dutch poet [[Willem Bilderdijk]], whom he met twice, in 1824 and 1826, at Bilderdijk's home in [[Leiden]]. He expressed appreciation of the work of the English novelist [[Ann Doherty]].<ref>Links to letters [[Romantic Circles]]: \"Attersoll, Ann...\" [https://www.rc.umd.edu/node/103426 Retrieved 11 November 2017.]</ref>\n\nIn 1837 Southey received a letter from [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]], seeking his advice on some of her poems. He wrote back praising her talents, but discouraging her from writing professionally: \"Literature cannot be the business of a woman's life,\" he argued. Years later, Bront\u00eb remarked to a friend that the letter was \"kind and admirable; a little stringent, but it did me good.\"\n\nIn 1838 Edith died and Southey remarried, to [[Caroline Anne Southey|Caroline Anne Bowles]], also a poet, on 4 June 1839.<ref>{{cite web |last= Blain |first=Virginia H. |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26054 |title=Southey, Caroline Anne Bowles (1786\u20131854), poet and writer |work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |edition=online |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |accessdate=}} {{ODNBsub}}</ref> Southey's mind was giving way when he wrote a last letter to his friend Landor in 1839, but he continued to mention Landor's name when generally incapable of mentioning any one. He died on 21 March 1843 and was buried in the churchyard of [[Crosthwaite Parish Church|Crosthwaite Church]], Keswick, where he had worshipped for forty years. There is a memorial to him inside the church, with an epitaph written by his friend, William Wordsworth.\n\nA few of Southey's ballads are still read by British schoolchildren, the best-known being ''[[The Inchcape Rock]]'', ''God's Judgement on a Wicked Bishop'', ''[[After Blenheim]]'' (possibly one of the earliest anti-war poems) and ''[[Cataract of Lodore]]''.\n\nAs a prolific writer and commentator, Southey introduced or popularised a number of words into the English language. The term ''autobiography'', for example, was used by Southey in 1809 in the ''Quarterly Review'', in which he predicted an \"epidemical rage for autobiography\", which indeed has continued to the present day.{{efn|The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' entry for ''autobiography'' contains an earlier quotation using this word.}}\n\n==Politics==\n[[File:Knife-Grinder-Gillray.jpeg|thumb|A 1797 caricature of Southey's early radical poetry]]\nAlthough originally a radical supporter of the [[French Revolution]], Southey followed the trajectory of his fellow Romantic poets Wordsworth and Coleridge towards conservatism. Embraced by the Tory establishment as Poet Laureate, and from 1807 in receipt of a yearly stipend from them, he vigorously supported the [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Liverpool]] government. He argued against parliamentary reform (\"the railroad to ruin with the Devil for driver\"), blamed the [[Peterloo Massacre]] on an allegedly revolutionary \"rabble\" killed and injured by government troops, and spurned Catholic emancipation.<ref>{{cite ODNB |id=26056 |title=Southey, Robert (1774\u20131843) |last1=Carnall |first1=Geoffrey}}</ref> In 1817 he privately proposed [[penal transportation]] for those guilty of \"libel\" or \"sedition\". He had in mind figures like [[Thomas Jonathan Wooler]] and [[William Hone]], whose prosecution he urged. Such writers were guilty, he wrote in the ''Quarterly Review'', of \"inflaming the turbulent temper of the manufacturer and disturbing the quiet attachment of the peasant to those institutions under which he and his fathers have dwelt in peace.\" Wooler and Hone were acquitted, but the threats caused another target, [[William Cobbett]], to emigrate temporarily to the United States.\n\nIn some respects, Southey was ahead of his time in his views on social reform. For example, he was an early critic of the evils the new factory system brought to early 19th-century Britain. He was appalled by the living conditions in towns like [[Birmingham]] and [[Manchester]] and especially by employment of children in factories and outspoken about them. He sympathised with the pioneering socialist plans of [[Robert Owen]], advocated that the state promote public works to maintain high employment, and called for universal education.<ref>Carnall (1971), p. 9.</ref>\n\nGiven his departure from radicalism, and his attempts to have former fellow travellers prosecuted, it is unsurprising that less successful contemporaries who kept the faith attacked Southey. They saw him as selling out for money and respectability.\n\nIn 1817 Southey was confronted with the surreptitious publication of a radical play, ''Wat Tyler'', which he had written in 1794 at the height of his radical period. This was instigated by his enemies in an attempt to embarrass the Poet Laureate and highlight his apostasy from radical poet to supporter of the Tory establishment. One of his most savage critics was [[William Hazlitt]]. In his portrait of Southey, in ''[[The Spirit of the Age]]'', he wrote: \"He wooed Liberty as a youthful lover, but it was perhaps more as a mistress than a bride; and he has since wedded with an elderly and not very reputable lady, called Legitimacy.\" Southey largely ignored his critics but was forced to defend himself when William Smith, a member of Parliament, rose in the House of Commons on 14 March to attack him. In a spirited response Southey wrote an open letter to the MP, in which he explained that he had always aimed at lessening human misery and bettering the condition of all the lower classes and that he had only changed in respect of \"the means by which that amelioration was to be effected.\"<ref name=\"Speck 2006, p. 172\">Speck (2006) p. 172.</ref> As he put it, \"that as he learnt to understand the institutions of his country, he learnt to appreciate them rightly, to love, and to revere, and to defend them.\"<ref name=\"Speck 2006, p. 172\"/>\n\nAnother critic of Southey in his later period was [[Thomas Love Peacock]], who scorned him in the character of Mr. Feathernest in his 1817 satirical novel ''[[Melincourt (novel)|Melincourt]]''.<ref>Howard Mills: ''Peacock, His Circle and His Age'' (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1969) p. 115 ff. [https://books.google.com/books?id=9C9mkMwfyYMC&pg=PA115&lpg=PA115&dq=Peacock+Mr.+Feathernest&source=bl&ots=pNxwgzv2D6&sig=LF3p3d6E0iZOrEAh4b1NE_Tu944&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi7g_ann8ncAhUFkiwKHb9JAX4Q6AEwAHoECAEQAQ#v=onepage&q=Peacock%20Mr.%20Feathernest&f=false Retrieved 31 July 2018.](</ref>\n\nHe was often mocked for what were seen as sycophantic odes to the king, notably in [[Lord Byron|Byron]]'s long ironic dedication of ''[[Don Juan (poem)|Don Juan]]'' to Southey. In the poem Southey is dismissed as insolent, narrow and shabby. This was based both on Byron's disrespect for Southey's literary talent, and his disdain for what he perceived as Southey's hypocritical turn to conservatism later in life. Much of the animosity between the two men can be traced back to Byron's belief that Southey had spread rumours about him and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] being in a \"League of Incest\" during their time on [[Lake Geneva]] in 1816, an accusation that Southey strenuously denied.\n\nIn response, Southey attacked what he called the [[Satanic School]] among modern poets in the preface to his poem, ''A Vision of Judgement'', written after the death of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]]. While not naming Byron, it was clearly directed at him. Byron retaliated with ''[[The Vision of Judgment]]'', a parody of Southey's poem.\n\nWithout his prior knowledge, the [[Jacob Pleydell-Bouverie, 2nd Earl of Radnor|Earl of Radnor]], an admirer of his work, had Southey returned as MP for the latter's [[pocket borough]] seat of [[Downton (UK Parliament constituency)|Downton]] in [[Wiltshire]] at the [[1826 United Kingdom general election|1826 general election]], as an opponent of Catholic emancipation, but Southey refused to sit, causing a by-election in December that year, pleading that he did not have a large enough estate to support him through political life,<ref>MPs were then unsalaried, and expected to treat voters at election times.</ref> or want to take on the hours full attendance required. He wished to continue living in the Lake District and preferred to defend the [[Church of England]] in writing rather than speech. He declared that \"for me to change my scheme of life and go into Parliament, would be to commit a moral and intellectual suicide.\" His friend John Rickman, a Commons clerk, noted that \"prudential reasons would forbid his appearing in London\" as a Member.<ref name=hop>[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1820-1832/member/southey-robert-1774-1843] History of Parliament article.</ref>\n\nIn 1835 Southey declined the offer of a [[baronet]]cy, but accepted a life pension of \u00a3300 a year from Prime Minister [[Sir Robert Peel, 2nd Baronet|Sir Robert Peel]].<ref name=hop/> He is buried in the churchyard of [[Crosthwaite Parish Church]] in [[Cumbria]].\n\n==Honours and memberships==\nSouthey was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1822.<ref>[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlists American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]</ref> He was also a member of the [[Royal Spanish Academy]].\n\n==A partial list of works==\n*''Harold, or, The Castle of Morford'' (an unpublished Robin Hood novel that Southey wrote in 1791).<ref>Bodleian MS.
