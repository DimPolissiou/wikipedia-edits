{"title_page": "Click consonant", "text_new": "{{Manner of articulation}}\n'''Click consonants''', or clicks, are speech sounds that occur as [[consonants]] in many languages of [[Southern Africa]] and in three languages of [[East Africa]]. Examples familiar to English-speakers are the ''[[Tut-tut]]'' (British spelling) or ''Tsk! Tsk!'' (American spelling) used to express disapproval or pity, the ''[[lateral click|tchick!]]'' used to spur on a horse, and the ''[[alveolar click|clip-clop!]]'' sound children make with their tongue to imitate a horse trotting.\n\nTechnically, clicks are [[obstruent]]s articulated with two closures (points of contact) in the mouth, one forward and one at the back. The enclosed pocket of air is [[rarefaction|rarefied]] by a sucking action of the tongue (in technical terminology, clicks have a [[Airstream mechanism|lingual ingressive airstream mechanism]]). The forward closure is then released,<ref group=note>This is the case for all clicks that constitute consonants in words. Paralinguistically, however, there are other methods of making clicks: ''under'' the tongue and by releasing the rear occlusion first. See [[#Places of articulation]].</ref> producing what may be the loudest consonants in the language, but in some languages such as [[Hadza language|Hadza]] and [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]], clicks can be more subtle and may even be mistaken for [[ejective consonant|ejectives]].\n\n==Notation and sound description==\n{{IPA non-pulmonic consonants|ejectives=no|implosives=no|audio=yes|class=infobox}}\n\nClick consonants occur at six principal places of articulation. The [[International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)]] may represent a click by placing the assigned symbol for five of the places of articulation (there is as yet no dedicated symbol for the sixth) adjacent to a symbol for a non-click sound at the rear place of articulation, or the click symbol may be combined with diacritics for voicing, nasalization, etc. The IPA symbols are used in writing most [[Khoisan languages]], but [[Bantu languages]] such as [[Zulu language|Zulu]] typically use [[Latin script|Latin]] {{angbr|c}}, {{angbr|x}} and {{angbr|q}} for dental, lateral and alveolar clicks respectively.\n* The easiest clicks for English speakers are the [[dental click]]s written with a single pipe, {{IPA|\u01c0}}. They are all sharp (high-pitched) squeaky sounds made by sucking on the front teeth. A simple dental click is used in English to express pity or to shame someone, and sometimes to call an animal, and is written ''tut!'' in British English and ''tsk!'' in American English. In Italian this sound means \"no\" used as an answer to a direct question, while it is used to call cats when repeated several times.\n* Next most familiar to English speakers are the [[lateral click]]s written with a double pipe, {{IPA|\u01c1}}. They are also squeaky sounds, though less sharp than {{IPA|\u01c0}}, made by sucking on the molars on either side (or both sides) of the mouth. A simple lateral click is made in English to get a horse moving, and is conventionally written ''tchick!''\n* Then there are the [[labial click]]s, written with a bull's eye, {{IPA|\u0298}}. These are lip-smacking sounds, but without the pursing of the lips found in a kiss.\n\nThe above clicks sound like [[affricate]]s, in that they involve a lot of friction. The other two families are more abrupt sounds that do not have this friction.\n* With the [[alveolar click]]s, written with an exclamation mark, {{IPA|\u01c3}}, the tip of the tongue is pulled down abruptly and forcefully from the roof of the mouth, sometimes using a lot of jaw motion, and making a hollow ''pop!'' like a cork being pulled from an empty bottle. These sounds can be quite loud.\n* Finally, for most languages, the [[palatal click]]s, {{IPA|\u01c2}}, are made with a flat tongue, and are sharper popping sounds than the {{IPA|\u01c3}} clicks, like sharply snapped fingers.\n\n==Languages with clicks==\n\n=== Southern Africa ===\nClicks occur in all three [[Khoisan languages|Khoisan language families]] of [[southern Africa]], where they may be the most numerous consonants. To a lesser extent they occur in three neighbouring groups of [[Bantu languages]]\u2014which [[Sprachbund|borrowed them]], directly or indirectly, from Khoisan. In the southeast, in eastern [[South Africa]], [[Swaziland]], [[Lesotho]], [[Zimbabwe]] and southern [[Mozambique]], they were adopted from a [[Tuu languages|Tuu language]] or languages by the languages of the Nguni cluster (especially [[Zulu language|Zulu]], [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] and [[Phuthi language|Phuthi]], but also to a lesser extent [[Swati language|Swazi]] and [[Southern Ndebele language|Ndebele]]), and spread from them in a reduced fashion to the Zulu-based [[pidgin]] [[Fanagalo]], [[Sesotho language|Sesotho]], [[Tsonga language|Tsonga]], [[Ronga language|Ronga]], the Mzimba dialect of [[Tumbuka language|Tumbuka]] and more recently to [[Ndau language|Ndau]] and urban varieties of [[Pedi language|Pedi]], where the spread of clicks continues. The second point of transfer was near the [[Caprivi Strip]] and the [[Okavango River]] where, apparently, the [[Yeyi language]] borrowed the clicks from a [[Khoe languages|West Kalahari Khoe language]]; a separate development led to a smaller click inventory in the neighbouring [[Mbukushu language|Mbukushu]], [[Kwangali language|Kwangali]], [[Gciriku language|Gciriku]], [[Kuhane language|Kuhane]] and [[Fwe language|Fwe]] languages in [[Angola]], [[Namibia]], [[Botswana]] and [[Zambia]].<ref>Derek Nurse & G\u00e9rard Philippson (2003) ''The Bantu languages,'' pp 31\u201332</ref> These sounds occur not only in borrowed vocabulary, but have spread to native Bantu words as well, in the case of Nguni at least partially due to a type of word taboo called [[hlonipha]]. Some [[creolised]] varieties of Afrikaans, such as [[Oorlams Creole|Oorlams]], retain clicks in Khoekhoe words.\n\n=== East Africa ===\nThree languages in [[East Africa]] use clicks: [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]] and [[Hadza language|Hadza]] of [[Tanzania]], and [[Dahalo language|Dahalo]], an endangered South [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic language]] of [[Kenya]] that has clicks in only a few dozen words. It is thought the latter may remain from an episode of [[language shift]].\n\n=== Damin ===\nThe only non-African language known to have clicks as regular speech sounds is [[Damin]], a ritual code once used by speakers of [[Lardil language|Lardil]] in [[Australia]]. One of the clicks in Damin is actually an [[Egressive sound|egressive]] click, using the tongue to compress the air in the mouth for an outward (egressive) \"spurt\".\n\n===Spread of clicks from loanwords===\nOnce clicks are borrowed into a language as regular speech sounds, they may spread to native words, as has happened due to ''[[hlonipa]]'' word-taboo in the [[Nguni languages]]. In [[Gciriku language|Gciriku]], for example, the European loanword ''tomate'' (tomato) appears as ''cum\u00e1te'' with a click ''c'', though it begins with a ''t'' in all neighbouring languages.\n\n=== Marginal usage of clicks ===\nScattered clicks are found in [[ideophone]]s and mimesis in other languages, such as [[Kongo language|Kongo]] {{IPA|/\u1d51\u01c3/}}, [[Mijikenda language|Mijikenda]] {{IPA|/\u1d51\u01c0/}} and Hadza {{IPA|/\u0298\u0303\u02b7/}} (Hadza does not otherwise have labial clicks). Ideophones often use phonemic distinctions not found in normal vocabulary.\n\nEnglish and many other languages may use bare clicks in [[interjection]]s, without the accompaniment of vowels, such as the dental \"tsk-tsk\" sound used to express disapproval, or the lateral ''tchick'' used with horses. In [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Levantine Arabic]], [[Maltese language|Maltese]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], occasionally in [[French language|French]], as well as southern Italian languages such as [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]], in which a bare dental click accompanied by tipping the head upwards signifies \"no\". [[Libyan Arabic]] apparently has three such sounds.\n\nClicks occasionally turn up elsewhere, as in the special [[register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] twins sometimes develop with each other. In [[West Africa]], clicks have been reported allophonically, and similarly in French and German, faint clicks have been recorded in rapid speech where consonants such as {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/k/}} overlap between words.<ref name=germ>{{cite conference|first=Sussanne|last=Fuchs|first2=Laura|last2=Koenig|first3=Ralf|last3=Winkler|title=Weak clicks in German|format=pdf|conference=Proceedings of the 16th International Congress of Phonetic Sciences|pages=449\u2013452|year=2007|location=Saarbr\u00fccken|url=http://www.icphs2007.de/conference/Papers/1678/1678.pdf}}</ref> In [[Rwanda language|Rwanda]], the sequence {{IPA|/m\u014b/}} may be pronounced either with an epenthetic vowel, {{IPA|[m\u1d4a\u014b]}}, or with a light bilabial click, {{IPA|[m\u0298\u0303\u014b]}}\u2014often by the same speaker.\n\nSpeakers of [[Gan Chinese]] from [[Ningdu]] county, as well as speakers of Mandarin from Beijing and [[Jilin]] and presumably people from other parts of the country, produce flapped nasal clicks in nursery rhymes with varying degrees of competence, in the words for 'goose' and 'duck', both of which begin with {{IPA|/\u014b/}} in Gan and until recently began with {{IPA|/\u014b/}} in Mandarin as well. In Gan, the nursery rhyme is,\n:''t\u02b0ien i ts\u02b0ak \u1d51\u01c3\u00a1o'' 'a goose in the sky'\n:''ti ha i ts\u02b0ak \u1d51\u01c3\u00a1a'' 'a duck on the ground'\n:''\u1d51\u01c3\u00a1o sa\u014b \u1d51\u01c3\u00a1o t\u02b0an, \u1d51\u01c3\u00a1o p\u02b0au \u1d51\u01c3\u00a1o'' 'a goose lays a goose egg, a goose hatches a goose'\n:''\u1d51\u01c3\u00a1a sa\u014b \u1d51\u01c3\u00a1a t\u02b0an, \u1d51\u01c3\u00a1a p\u02b0au \u1d51\u01c3\u00a1a'' 'a duck lays a duck egg, a duck hatches a duck'\nwhere the {{IPA|/\u014b/}} onsets are all pronounced {{IPA|[\u01c3\u0303\u00a1]}}.<ref>Geoffrey Nathan, 'Clicks in a Chinese Nursery Rhyme', JIPA (2001) 31/2.</ref>\n\nOccasionally other languages are claimed to have click sounds in general vocabulary. This is usually a misnomer for [[ejective consonant]]s, which are found across much of the world.\n\n=== Position in word ===\nFor the most part, the Southern African [[Khoisan languages]] only use [[root word|root]]-initial clicks.<ref group=\"note\">Exceptions occurs in words borrowed from Bantu languages, which may have click in the middle.</ref> Hadza, Sandawe and several [[Bantu languages]] also allow [[syllable]]-initial clicks within roots. In no language does a click close a syllable or end a word, but then the languages that happen to have clicks have mostly CV syllables and allow at most only a limited set of consonants (such as a nasal or a glottal stop) to close a syllable or end a word, most consonants share the distribution of clicks in these languages.\n\n=== Types of clicks used ===\nThe Khoesan families (Tuu, Kx\u02bca and Khoe) all have at least four click types, {{IPA|{\u01c0 \u01c1 \u01c3 \u01c2}}} or variants thereof. A few have five, with bilabial {{IPA|{\u0298}}} or retroflex {{IPA|{\u203c}}}. Hadza and Sandawe have three, {{IPA|{\u01c0 \u01c1 \u01c3}}}. Yeyi is the only Bantu language with four, {{IPA|{\u01c0 \u01c1 \u01c3 \u01c2}}}, while Xhosa and Zulu have three, {{IPA|{\u01c0 \u01c1 \u01c3}}}, and most Bantu languages with clicks have fewer than that.\n\n==Types of clicks==\nLike other consonants, clicks can be described using four parameters: [[place of articulation]], [[manner of articulation]], [[phonation]] (including glottalisation) and [[airstream mechanism]]. As noted above, clicks necessarily involve at least two closures, which in some cases operate partially independently: an anterior articulation traditionally represented by the special click symbol in the IPA\u2014and a posterior articulation traditionally described as oral or [[nasal consonant|nasal]], voiced or voiceless, etc. The literature also describes a contrast between [[velar consonant|velar]] and [[uvular consonant|uvular]] rear articulations for some languages.\n\nHowever, recent work shows that in languages that make this distinction, all clicks have a uvular, or even pharyngeal, rear closure\u2014and the clicks explicitly described as uvular are in fact clusters/contours of a click plus a pulmonic or ejective component, in which the cluster/contour has two release bursts, the forward (click) and then the rearward (uvular) component. \"Velar\" clicks in these languages have only a single release burst, that of the forward click release, and the release of the rear articulation isn't separately audible (Miller 2011).\n\nNonetheless, in most of the literature the stated place of the click is the anterior articulation (called the ''release'' or ''influx),'' whereas the manner is ascribed to the posterior articulation (called the ''accompaniment'' or ''efflux).'' The anterior articulation defines the ''click type'' and is written with the IPA letter for the click (dental {{angbr IPA|\u01c0}}, alveolar {{angbr IPA|\u01c3}}, etc.), whereas the traditional term 'accompaniment' conflates the categories of manner (nasal, affricated), phonation (voiced, aspirated, breathy voiced, glottalised), as well as any change in the airstream with the release of the posterior articulation (pulmonic, ejective), all of which are transcribed with additional letters or diacritics, as in the ''nasal alveolar click'', {{angbr IPA|\u01c3\u014b}} or {{angbr IPA|\u1d51\u01c3}} or\u2014to take an extreme example\u2014the ''voiced (uvular) ejective alveolar click'', {{angbr IPA|\u1da2\u01c3\u0361q\u02bc}}.\n\nThe size of click inventories ranges from as few as three (in [[Sesotho phonology#Consonants|Sesotho]]) or four (in [[Dahalo language|Dahalo]]), to dozens in the [[Kx\u02bca languages|Kx\u02bca]] and [[Tuu languages|Tuu]] (Northern and Southern Khoisan) languages. [[Taa language|Taa]], the last vibrant language in the latter family, has 45 to 115 click phonemes, depending on analysis (clusters vs. contours), and over 70% of words in the dictionary of this language begin with a click.<ref>L&M 1996, p 246</ref>\n\nClicks appear more [[stop consonant|stop]]-like (sharp/abrupt) or [[affricate]]-like (noisy) depending on their place of articulation: In southern Africa, clicks involving an [[apical consonant|apical]] [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] or [[laminal consonant|laminal]] [[postalveolar consonant|postalveolar]] closure are acoustically abrupt and sharp, like stops, whereas [[labial consonant|labial]], [[dental consonant|dental]] and [[lateral consonant|lateral]] clicks typically have longer and acoustically noisier click types that are superficially more like affricates. In East Africa, however, the alveolar clicks tend to be [[flap consonant|flapped]], whereas the lateral clicks tend to be more sharp.\n\n==Transcription==\n{{further|click letter}}\nThe five click places of articulation with dedicated symbols in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA) are [[labial click|labial]] {{IPA|\u0298}}, [[dental click|dental]] {{IPA|\u01c0}}, [[palatal click|palatal]] (\"palato-alveolar\") {{IPA|\u01c2}}, [[postalveolar click|(post)alveolar]] (\"retroflex\") {{IPA|\u01c3}} and [[lateral click|lateral]] {{IPA|\u01c1}}. In most languages, the alveolar and palatal types are abrupt; that is, they are sharp popping sounds with little frication (turbulent airflow). The labial, dental and lateral types, on the other hand, are typically noisy: they are longer, lip- or tooth-sucking sounds with turbulent airflow, and are sometimes called affricates. (This applies to the forward articulation; both may also have either an affricate or non-affricate rear articulation as well.) The [[apical consonant|apical]] places, {{IPA|\u01c3}} and {{IPA|\u01c1}}, are sometimes called \"grave\", because their pitch is dominated by low frequencies; whereas the [[laminal consonant|laminal]] places, {{IPA|\u01c0}} and {{IPA|\u01c2}}, are sometimes called \"acute\", because they are dominated by high frequencies. (At least in the [[N\u01c1ng language]] and [[Ju\u01c0\u02bchoan language|Ju\u01c0\u02bchoan]], this is associated with a difference in the placement of the rear articulation: \"grave\" clicks are [[uvular consonant|uvular]], whereas \"acute\" clicks are [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]].) Thus the alveolar click {{IPA|/\u01c3/}} sounds something like a cork pulled from a bottle (a low-pitch pop), at least in Xhosa; whereas the dental click {{IPA|/\u01c0/}} is like English ''tsk! tsk!,'' a high-pitched sucking on the incisors. The lateral clicks are pronounced by sucking on the molars of one or both sides. The labial click {{IPA|/\u0298/}} is different from what many people associate with a kiss: the lips are pressed more-or-less flat together, as they are for a {{IPA|[p]}} or an {{IPA|[m]}}, not rounded as they are for a {{IPA|[w]}}.\n\nThe most populous languages with clicks, Zulu and Xhosa, use the letters ''c, q, x,'' by themselves and in [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]], to write click consonants. Most Khoisan languages, on the other hand (with the notable exceptions of [[Naro language|Naro]] and [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]]), use a more iconic system based on the [[Vertical bar|pipe]] {{angbr|<nowiki>|</nowiki>}}. (The exclamation point for the \"retroflex\" click was originally a pipe with a subscript dot, along the lines of ''\u1e6d, \u1e0d, \u1e47'' used to transcribe the retroflex consonants of India.) There are also two main conventions for the second letter of the digraph as well: voicing may be written with ''g'' and uvular affrication with ''x'', or voicing with ''d'' and affrication with ''g'' (a convention of Afrikaans). In two orthographies of Ju\u01c0\u02bchoan, for example, {{IPA|/\u01c3\u032c/}} is written ''g!'' or ''dq'', and {{IPA|/\u01c3\u0361\u03c7/}} ''!x'' or ''qg''. In languages without {{IPA|/\u01c3\u0361\u03c7/}}, such as Zulu, {{IPA|/\u01c3\u032c/}} may be written ''gq''.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|+ Competing orthographies\n!rowspan=2| !!rowspan=2|labial!!colspan=2|laminal!!colspan=2|apical !!subapical\n|-\n!dental!!palatal!!alveolar!!lateral!!retroflex\n|- align=center\n!

However, the palatal clicks have been romanised in Naron, [[Ju\u01c0\u02bchoan language|Ju\u01c0\u02bch\u00f5asi]] and !Xun,{{which|date=December 2012}} where they have been written {{angbr|tc}}, {{angbr|\u00e7}} and {{angbr|qc}}, respectively. In the 19th century, they were sometimes written {{angbr|v}}, which might be source of the Doke letter {{angbr|\u2186}}.\n\nThere are a few less-well-attested articulations. <!--Note: the 2nd lateral click in Mangetti Dune could not be reproduced, and the authors have retracted their claim (vd. Miller & Shah 2009).

However, the Khoisan languages are poorly attested, and it is quite possible that, as they become better described, more click articulations will be found.\n\nFormerly when a click consonant was transcribed, two symbols were used, one for each articulation, and connected with a tie bar. This is because a click such as {{IPA|[\u014b\u0361\u01c2]}} was analysed as a nasal velar rear articulation {{IPA|[\u014b]}} pronounced simultaneously with the forward ingressive release {{IPA|[\u01c2]}}. The symbols may be written in either order, depending on the analysis: {{angbr IPA|\u014b\u0361\u01c2}} or {{angbr IPA|\u01c2\u0361\u014b}}. However, a tie bar was not often used in practice, and when the manner is [[tenuis consonant|tenuis]] (a simple {{IPA|[k]}}), it was often omitted as well. That is, {{angbr IPA|\u01c2}} = {{angbr IPA|k\u01c2}} = {{angbr IPA|\u01c2k}} = {{angbr IPA|k\u0361\u01c2}} = {{angbr IPA|\u01c2\u0361k}}. Regardless, elements that do not overlap with the forward release are usually written according to their temporal order: Prenasalisation is always written first ({{angbr IPA|\u014b\u0261\u0361\u01c2}} = {{angbr IPA|\u014b\u01c2\u0361\u0261}} = {{angbr IPA|\u014b\u01c2\u032c}}), and the non-lingual part of a contour is always written second ({{angbr IPA|k\u0361\u01c2\u02bcq\u02bc}} = {{angbr IPA|\u01c2\u0361k\u02bcq\u02bc}} = {{angbr IPA|\u01c2\u0361q\u02bc}}).\n\nHowever, it has become standard to analyse clicks as simplex segments, as research has shown that the front and rear articulations are not independent, and to use click symbols to cover the rear articulation as well, with diacritics rather than digraphs for the accompaniments. At first this tended to be {{angbr IPA|\u01c2, \u1da2\u01c2, \u1d51\u01c2}} for {{angbr IPA|k\u0361\u01c2, \u0261\u0361\u01c2, \u014b\u0361\u01c2}}, based on the belief that the rear articulation was velar; but as it has become clear that the rear articulation of both \"velar\" and \"uvular\" clicks is actually uvular or even pharyngeal, voicing and nasalisation diacritics more in keeping with the IPA have started to appear: {{angbr IPA|\u01c2, \u01c2\u032c, \u01c2\u0303, \u014b\u01c2\u032c}} for {{angbr IPA|\u01c2, \u1da2\u01c2, \u1d51\u01c2, \u014b\u1da2\u01c2}}.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable IPA\"\n|+Evolution of accompaniment transcription\n|-\n! !!

Since then there has been some conflicting variation. Here are the terms used in some of the main references.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! Click type !! Bantu letters !!

However, the palatal and alveolar clicks frequently have the opposite names in older literature, and they were not distinguished in the IPA until 1989. However, since Ladefoged & Traill (1984) clarified the places of articulation, the terms in the left column above have become standard.<ref group=note>A current exception is [[Unicode]], which still calls the palatal clicks 'alveolar' and the alveolar clicks 'retroflex'.</ref>\n\n==The back-vowel constraint==\n[[Image:Clicks and the BVC.svg|thumb|The shape of the tongue in Nama when articulating an alveolar click (blue) and a palatal click (red) [throat to the right]. The articulation of the vowel {{IPA|[i]}} is slightly forward of the red line, with its peak coinciding with the dip of the blue line.]]\nIn several languages, including [[Nama language|Nama]] and [[Ju\u01c0\u02bchoan dialect|Ju\u01c0\u02bchoan]], the alveolar click types {{IPA|[\u01c3]}} and {{IPA|[\u01c1]}} only occur, or preferentially occur, before [[back vowel]]s, whereas the dental and palatal clicks occur before any vowel. The effect is most noticeable with the high front vowel {{IPA|[i]}}. In Nama, for example, the diphthong {{IPA|[\u0259i]}} is common but {{IPA|[i]}} is rare after alveolar clicks, whereas the opposite is true after dental and palatal clicks. This is a common effect of [[uvular consonant|uvular]] or uvularised consonants on vowels in both click and non-click languages. In [[Taa language|Taa]], for example, the back-vowel constraint is triggered by both alveolar clicks and uvular stops, but not by palatal clicks or velar stops: sequences such as {{IPA|*/\u01c3i/}} and {{IPA|*/qi/}} are rare to non-existent, whereas sequences such as {{IPA|/\u01c2i/}} and {{IPA|/ki/}} are common. It is also triggered by labial clicks, though not by labial stops. Clicks subject to this constraint involve a sharp [[retracted tongue root|retraction]] of the tongue during release.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable IPA\"\n! !!Abrupt <br>release!!Noisy <br>release\n|-\n|ballistic tongue retraction<br>& back-vowel constraint\n|align=center|\u01c3||align=center|\u01c1, \u0298\n|-\n|no retraction, no constraint\n|align=center|\u01c2||align=center|\u01c0\n|}\n\nMiller and colleagues (2003) used [[ultrasound imaging]] to show that the rear articulation of the alveolar clicks ({{IPA|[\u01c3]}}) in Nama is substantially different from that of palatal and dental clicks. Specifically, the shape of the body of the tongue in palatal clicks is very similar to that of the vowel {{IPA|[i]}}, and involves the same tongue muscles, so that sequences such as {{IPA|[\u01c2i]}} involved a simple and quick transition. The rear articulation of the alveolar clicks, however, is several centimetres further back, and involves a different set of muscles in the uvular region. The part of the tongue required to approach the palate for the vowel {{IPA|[i]}} is deeply retracted in {{IPA|[\u01c3]}}, as it lies at the bottom of the air pocket used to create the vacuum required for click airstream. This makes the transition required for {{IPA|[\u01c3i]}} much more complex and the timing more difficult than the shallower and more forward tongue position of the palatal clicks. Consequently, {{IPA|[\u01c3i]}} takes 50 [[millisecond|ms]] longer to pronounce than {{IPA|[\u01c2i]}}, the same amount of time required to pronounce {{IPA|[\u01c3\u0259i]}}.\n\nLanguages do not all behave alike. In [[N\u01c1ng language|N\u01c0uu]], the simple clicks {{IPA|/\u0298, \u01c3, \u01c1/}} trigger the {{IPA|[\u0259i]}} and {{IPA|[\u00e6]}} allophones of {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/e/}}, whereas {{IPA|/\u01c0, \u01c2/}} do not. All of the affricated contour clicks, such as {{IPA|/\u01c2\u0361\u03c7/}}, do as well, as do the uvular stops {{IPA|/q, \u03c7/}}. However, the occlusive contour clicks pattern like the simple clicks, and {{IPA|/\u01c2\u0361q/}} does not trigger the back-vowel constraint. This is because they involve tongue-root raising rather than [[Advanced and retracted tongue root|tongue-root retraction]] in the uvular-pharyngeal region. However, in [[G\u01c0wi dialect|G\u01c0wi]], which is otherwise largely similar, both {{IPA|/\u01c2\u0361q/}} and {{IPA|/\u01c2\u0361\u03c7/}} trigger the back-vowel constraint (Miller 2009).\n\n==Manners of articulation==\n{{main|nasal click|glottalised click|pulmonic-contour click|ejective-contour click}}\nClick manners are often called click ''accompaniments'' or ''effluxes'', but both terms have met with objections on theoretical grounds.\n\nThere is a great variety of click manners, both simplex and complex, the latter variously analysed as consonant [[consonant cluster|clusters]] or [[contour (linguistics)|contours]]. With so few click languages, and so little study of them, it is also unclear to what extent clicks in different languages are equivalent. For example, the {{IPA|[\u01c3k\u02c0]}} of Khoekhoe, {{IPA|[\u01c3k\u02c0 ~ \u014b\u02c0\u01c3k]}} of Sandawe and {{IPA|[\u014b\u030a\u01c3\u02c0 ~ \u014b\u01c3k\u02c0]}} of Hadza may be essentially the same phone; no language distinguishes them, and the differences in transcription may have more to do with the approach of the linguist than with actual differences in the sounds. Such suspected allophones/allographs are listed on a common row in the table below.\n\nSome Khoisan languages are [[Linguistic typology|typologically]] unusual in allowing mixed [[phonation|voicing]] in non-click consonant clusters/contours, such as {{IPA|dt\u0361s\u02bck\u0361x\u02bc}}, so it is not surprising that they would allow mixed voicing in clicks as well. This may be an effect of epiglottalised voiced consonants, because voicing is incompatible with epiglottalisation.\n\n===Phonation===\nAs do other consonants, clicks vary in [[phonation]]. Oral clicks are attested with four phonations: [[tenuis consonant|tenuis]], [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]], [[voiced consonant|voiced]] and [[breathy voice]]d (murmured). Nasal clicks may also vary, with plain voiced, breathy voiced / murmured nasal, aspirated and unaspirated voiceless clicks attested (the last only in Taa). The aspirated nasal clicks are often said to have 'delayed aspiration'; there is nasal airflow throughout the click, which may become voiced between vowels, though the aspiration itself is voiceless. A few languages also have pre-glottalised nasal clicks, which have very brief prenasalisation<!--creaky-voiced nasal?--> but have not been phonetically analysed to the extent that other types of clicks have.\n\nAll languages have nasal clicks, and all but [[Dahalo language|Dahalo]] and [[Damin]] also have oral clicks. All languages but Damin have at least one phonation contrast as well.\n\n===Complex clicks===\nClicks may be pronounced with a third place of articulation, glottal. A [[glottal stop]] is made during the hold of the click; the (necessarily voiceless) click is released, and then the glottal hold is released into the vowel. Glottalised clicks are very common, and they are generally nasalised as well. The nasalisation cannot be heard during the click release, as there is no pulmonic airflow, and generally not at all when the click occurs at the beginning of an utterance, but it has the effect of nasalising preceding vowels, to the extent that the glottalised clicks of Sandawe and Hadza are often described as prenasalised when in medial position. Two languages, [[G\u01c0wi dialect|G\u01c0wi]] and [[Yeyi language|Yeyi]], contrast plain and nasal glottalised clicks, but in languages without such a contrast, the glottalised click is nasal. Miller (2011) analyses the glottalisation as phonation, and so considers these to be simple clicks.\n\nVarious languages also have prenasalised clicks, which may be analysed as consonant sequences. [[Sotho language|Sotho]], for example, allows a syllabic nasal before its three clicks, as in ''nnqane'' 'the other side' (prenasalised nasal) and ''seqhenqha'' 'hunk'.\n\nThere is ongoing discussion as to how the distinction between what were historically described as 'velar' and 'uvular' clicks is best described. The 'uvular' clicks are only found in some languages, and have an extended pronunciation that suggests that they are more complex than the simple ('velar') clicks, which are found in all. Nakagawa (1996) describes the extended clicks in [[G\u01c0wi dialect|G\u01c0wi]] as [[consonant cluster]]s, sequences equivalent to English ''st'' or ''pl'', whereas Miller (2011) analyses similar sounds in several languages as click\u2013non-click [[contour (linguistics)|contours]], where a click transitions into a pulmonic or ejective articulation within a single segment, analogous to how English ''ch'' and ''j'' transition from occlusive to fricative but still behave as unitary sounds. With ejective clicks, for example, Miller finds that although the ejective release follows the click release, it is the rear closure of the click that is ejective, not an independently articulated consonant. That is, in a simple click, the release of the rear articulation is not audible, whereas in a contour click, the rear (uvular) articulation is audibly released after the front (click) articulation, resulting in a double release.\n\nThese contour clicks may be ''linguo-pulmonic'', that is, they may transition from a click (lingual) articulation to a normal pulmonic consonant like {{IPAblink|q}} (e.g. {{IPA|[\u01c2\u0361q]}}); or ''linguo-glottalic'' and transition from lingual to an ejective consonant like {{IPAblink|q\u02bc}} (e.g. {{IPA|[\u01c2\u0361q\u02bc]}}): that is, a sequence of ingressive (lingual) release + egressive (pulmonic or glottalic) release. In some cases there is a shift in place of articulation as well, and instead of a uvular release, the uvular click transitions to a velar or [[Epiglottal consonant|epigottal]] release (depending on the description, {{IPA|[\u01c2\u0361kx\u02bc]}} or {{IPA|[\u01c2\u1d34]}}). Although [[homorganic]] {{IPA|[\u01c2\u0361\u03c7\u02bc]}} does not contrast with heterorganic {{IPA|[\u01c2\u0361kx\u02bc]}} in any known language, they are phonetically quite distinct (Miller 2011).\n\nApart from Dahalo, Damin and many of the Bantu languages (Yeyi and Xhosa being exceptions), 'click' languages have glottalised clicks. Contour clicks are restricted to southern Africa, but are very common there: they are found in all members of the Tuu, Kx\u02bca and Khoe families, as well as in the Bantu language Yeyi.\n\n===Variation among languages===\nIn a comparative study of clicks across various languages, using her own field work as well as phonetic descriptions and data by other field researchers, Miller (2011) posits 21 types of clicks that contrast in manner or airstream.<ref group=note>Not counting the egressive \"spurt\" in Damin, and tree additional voiced manners in Western \u01c3Xoo, which pair up with voiceless manners.</ref> The [[homorganic]] and heterorganic affricated ejective clicks do not contrast in any known language, but are judged dissimilar enough to keep separate.

The original researchers believe that {{IPA|[\ua7b0\u02b0]}} and {{IPA|[\ua7b0\u03c7]}} are allophones.\n\nA DoBeS (2008) study of the Western \u01c3Xoo dialect of Taa found several new manners: creaky voiced (the voiced equivalent of glottalised oral), breathy-voiced nasal, prenasalised glottalised (the voiced equivalent of glottalised) and a (pre)voiced ejective. These extra voiced clicks reflect Western \u01c3Xoo morphology, where many nouns form their plural by voicing their initial consonant. DoBeS analyses most Taa clicks as clusters, leaving nine basic manners (marked with asterisks in the table). This comes close to Miller's distinction between simple and contour clicks, shaded light and medium grey in the table.\n\n==Phonotactics==\nLanguages of the southern African Khoisan families only permit clicks at the beginning of a word root. However, they also restrict other classes of consonant, such as [[ejective consonant|ejectives]] and [[affricate]]s, to root-initial position. The Bantu languages, Hadza and Sandawe allow clicks within roots.\n\nIn some languages, all click consonants within known roots are the same phoneme, as in Hadza ''cikiringcingca'' {{IPA|/\u01c0iki\u027aiN.\u01c0iN.\u01c0a/}} 'pinkie finger', which has three [[tenuis dental click]]s. Other languages are known to have the occasional root with different clicks, as in Xhosa ''ugqwanxa'' {{IPA|/u\u1da2\u030a\u01c3\u02b1\u02b7a\u1d51\u01c1a/}} '[[Olea capensis|black ironwood]]', which has a slack-[[voiced alveolar click]] and a [[nasal lateral click]].\n\nLike other articulatorily complex consonants, clicks tend to be found in [[lexical words]] rather than in [[grammatical word]]s, but this is only a tendency. In [[N\u01c1ng language|N\u01c1ng]], for example, there are two sets of [[personal pronoun]]s, a full one without clicks and a partial set with clicks (''\u0144g'' 'I', ''\u00e1'' 'thou', ''\u00ed'' 'we all', ''\u00fa'' 'you', vs. ''n\u01c0\u01f9g'' 'I', ''g\u01c0\u00e0'' 'thou', ''g\u01c0\u00ec'' 'we all', ''g\u01c0\u00f9'' 'you'), as well as other grammatical words with clicks such as ''\u01c1u'' 'not' and ''n\u01c0a'' 'with, and'.\n\n==Click genesis and click loss==\nOne genetic study concluded that clicks, which occur in the languages of the genetically divergent populations Hadza and !Kung, may be an ancient element of human language.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Tishkoff |first=S.

How they arose is not known, but it is generally assumed that they developed from sequences of non-click consonants, as they are found allophonically for [[doubly articulated consonant]]s in West Africa,{{sfn|Ladefoged|1968}} where {{IPA|/tk/}} sequences overlap at word boundaries in German,<ref name=germ /> and for the sequence {{IPA|/mw/}} in [[Ndau language|Ndau]] and [[Tonga language (Zambia)|Tonga]].<ref group=note>Here the labial {{IPA|[m]}} may have assimilated to the velar place of the {{IPA|[w]}}, as {{IPA|[m\u0361\u014bw]}}, with the release of the labial before the velar later generating a click {{IPA|[\u1d50\u0298w]}}</ref> Such developments have also been posited in historical reconstruction. For example, the [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]] word for 'horn', {{IPA|/t\u026cana/}}, with a lateral affricate, may be a cognate with the root {{IPA|/\u1d51\u01c1a\u02d0/}} found throughout the [[Khoe languages|Khoe family]], which has a lateral click. This and other words suggests that at least some Khoe clicks may have formed from consonant clusters when the first vowel of a word was lost; in this instance *{{IPA|[t\u026cana]}} > *{{IPA|[t\u026cna]}} > {{IPA|[\u01c1\u014ba] ~ [\u1d51\u01c1a]}}.\n\nOn the other side of the equation, several non-endangered languages in vigorous use demonstrate click loss. For example, the [[Khoe languages|East Kalahari languages]] have lost clicks from a large percentage of their vocabulary, presumably due to [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] influence. As a rule, a click is replaced by a consonant with close to the [[manner of articulation]] of the click and the [[place of articulation]] of the forward release: alveolar click releases (the {{IPA|[\u01c3]}} family) tend to mutate into a velar stop or affricate, such as {{IPA|[k], [\u0261], [\u014b], [k\u0361x]}}; palatal clicks ({{IPA|[\u01c2]}} ''etc.'') tend to mutate into a palatal stop such as {{IPA|[c], [&thinsp;\u025f], [&thinsp;\u0272], [c\u02bc]}}, or a post-alveolar affricate {{IPA|[t\u0283], [d\u0292]}}; and dental clicks ({{IPA|[\u01c0]}} ''etc.'') tend to mutate into an alveolar affricate {{IPA|[ts]}}.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\n==Difficulty==\nClicks are often presented as difficult sounds to articulate within words. However, children acquire them readily; a two-year-old, for example, may be able to pronounce a word with a lateral click {{IPA|[\u01c1]}} with no problem, but still be unable to pronounce {{IPA|[s]}}.<ref>Kirk Miller, 'Highlights of Hadza fieldwork'.

Examples familiar to English-speakers are the ''[[Tut-tut]]'' (British spelling) or ''Tsk! Tsk!'' (American spelling) used to express disapproval or pity, the ''[[lateral click|tchick!]]'' used to spur on a horse, and the ''[[alveolar click|clip-clop!]]'' sound children make with their tongue to imitate a horse trotting.\n\nTechnically, clicks are [[obstruent]]s articulated with two closures (points of contact) in the mouth, one forward and one at the back. The enclosed pocket of air is [[rarefaction|rarefied]] by a sucking action of the tongue (in technical terminology, clicks have a [[Airstream mechanism|lingual ingressive airstream mechanism]]). The forward closure is then released,<ref group=note>This is the case for all clicks that constitute consonants in words. Paralinguistically, however, there are other methods of making clicks: ''under'' the tongue and by releasing the rear occlusion first. See [[#Places of articulation]].</ref> producing what may be the loudest consonants in the language, but in some languages such as [[Hadza language|Hadza]] and [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]], clicks can be more subtle and may even be mistaken for [[ejective consonant|ejectives]].\n\n==Notation and sound description==\n{{IPA non-pulmonic consonants|ejectives=no|implosives=no|audio=yes|class=infobox}}\n\nClick consonants occur at six principal places of articulation. The [[International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)]] may represent a click by placing the assigned symbol for five of the places of articulation (there is as yet no dedicated symbol for the sixth) adjacent to a symbol for a non-click sound at the rear place of articulation, or the click symbol may be combined with diacritics for voicing, nasalization, etc. The IPA symbols are used in writing most [[Khoisan languages]], but [[Bantu languages]] such as [[Zulu language|Zulu]] typically use [[Latin script|Latin]] {{angbr|c}}, {{angbr|x}} and {{angbr|q}} for dental, lateral and alveolar clicks respectively.\n* The easiest clicks for English speakers are the [[dental click]]s written with a single pipe, {{IPA|\u01c0}}. They are all sharp (high-pitched) squeaky sounds made by sucking on the front teeth. A simple dental click is used in English to express pity or to shame someone, and sometimes to call an animal, and is written ''tut!'' in British English and ''tsk!'' in American English. In Italian this sound means \"no\" used as an answer to a direct question, while it is used to call cats when repeated several times.\n* Next most familiar to English speakers are the [[lateral click]]s written with a double pipe, {{IPA|\u01c1}}. They are also squeaky sounds, though less sharp than {{IPA|\u01c0}}, made by sucking on the molars on either side (or both sides) of the mouth. A simple lateral click is made in English to get a horse moving, and is conventionally written ''tchick!''\n* Then there are the [[labial click]]s, written with a bull's eye, {{IPA|\u0298}}. These are lip-smacking sounds, but without the pursing of the lips found in a kiss.\n\nThe above clicks sound like [[affricate]]s, in that they involve a lot of friction. The other two families are more abrupt sounds that do not have this friction.\n* With the [[alveolar click]]s, written with an exclamation mark, {{IPA|\u01c3}}, the tip of the tongue is pulled down abruptly and forcefully from the roof of the mouth, sometimes using a lot of jaw motion, and making a hollow ''pop!'' like a cork being pulled from an empty bottle. These sounds can be quite loud.\n* Finally, for most languages, the [[palatal click]]s, {{IPA|\u01c2}}, are made with a flat tongue, and are sharper popping sounds than the {{IPA|\u01c3}} clicks, like sharply snapped fingers.\n\n==Languages with clicks==\n\n=== Southern Africa ===\nClicks occur in all three [[Khoisan languages|Khoisan language families]] of [[southern Africa]], where they may be the most numerous consonants. To a lesser extent they occur in three neighbouring groups of [[Bantu languages]]\u2014which [[Sprachbund|borrowed them]], directly or indirectly, from Khoisan. In the southeast, in eastern [[South Africa]], [[Swaziland]], [[Lesotho]], [[Zimbabwe]] and southern [[Mozambique]], they were adopted from a [[Tuu languages|Tuu language]] or languages by the languages of the Nguni cluster (especially [[Zulu language|Zulu]], [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] and [[Phuthi language|Phuthi]], but also to a lesser extent [[Swati language|Swazi]] and [[Southern Ndebele language|Ndebele]]), and spread from them in a reduced fashion to the Zulu-based [[pidgin]] [[Fanagalo]], [[Sesotho language|Sesotho]], [[Tsonga language|Tsonga]], [[Ronga language|Ronga]], the Mzimba dialect of [[Tumbuka language|Tumbuka]] and more recently to [[Ndau language|Ndau]] and urban varieties of [[Pedi language|Pedi]], where the spread of clicks continues. The second point of transfer was near the [[Caprivi Strip]] and the [[Okavango River]] where, apparently, the [[Yeyi language]] borrowed the clicks from a [[Khoe languages|West Kalahari Khoe language]]; a separate development led to a smaller click inventory in the neighbouring [[Mbukushu language|Mbukushu]], [[Kwangali language|Kwangali]], [[Gciriku language|Gciriku]], [[Kuhane language|Kuhane]] and [[Fwe language|Fwe]] languages in [[Angola]], [[Namibia]], [[Botswana]] and [[Zambia]].<ref>Derek Nurse & G\u00e9rard Philippson (2003) ''The Bantu languages,'' pp 31\u201332</ref> These sounds occur not only in borrowed vocabulary, but have spread to native Bantu words as well, in the case of Nguni at least partially due to a type of word taboo called [[hlonipha]]. Some [[creolised]] varieties of Afrikaans, such as [[Oorlams Creole|Oorlams]], retain clicks in Khoekhoe words.\n\n=== East Africa ===\nThree languages in [[East Africa]] use clicks: [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]] and [[Hadza language|Hadza]] of [[Tanzania]], and [[Dahalo language|Dahalo]], an endangered South [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic language]] of [[Kenya]] that has clicks in only a few dozen words. It is thought the latter may remain from an episode of [[language shift]].\n\n=== Damin ===\nThe only non-African language known to have clicks as regular speech sounds is [[Damin]], a ritual code once used by speakers of [[Lardil language|Lardil]] in [[Australia]]. One of the clicks in Damin is actually an [[Egressive sound|egressive]] click, using the tongue to compress the air in the mouth for an outward (egressive) \"spurt\".\n\n===Spread of clicks from loanwords===\nOnce clicks are borrowed into a language as regular speech sounds, they may spread to native words, as has happened due to ''[[hlonipa]]'' word-taboo in the [[Nguni languages]]. In [[Gciriku language|Gciriku]], for example, the European loanword ''tomate'' (tomato) appears as ''cum\u00e1te'' with a click ''c'', though it begins with a ''t'' in all neighbouring languages.\n\n=== Marginal usage of clicks ===\nScattered clicks are found in [[ideophone]]s and mimesis in other languages, such as [[Kongo language|Kongo]] {{IPA|/\u1d51\u01c3/}}, [[Mijikenda language|Mijikenda]] {{IPA|/\u1d51\u01c0/}} and Hadza {{IPA|/\u0298\u0303\u02b7/}} (Hadza does not otherwise have labial clicks). Ideophones often use phonemic distinctions not found in normal vocabulary.\n\nEnglish and many other languages may use bare clicks in [[interjection]]s, without the accompaniment of vowels, such as the dental \"tsk-tsk\" sound used to express disapproval, or the lateral ''tchick'' used with horses. In [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Levantine Arabic]], [[Maltese language|Maltese]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], occasionally in [[French language|French]], as well as southern Italian languages such as [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]], in which a bare dental click accompanied by tipping the head upwards signifies \"no\". [[Libyan Arabic]] apparently has three such sounds.\n\nClicks occasionally turn up elsewhere, as in the special [[register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] twins sometimes develop with each other. In [[West Africa]], clicks have been reported allophonically, and similarly in French and German, faint clicks have been recorded in rapid speech where consonants such as {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/k/}} overlap between words.<ref name=germ>{{cite conference|first=Sussanne|last=Fuchs|first2=Laura|last2=Koenig|first3=Ralf|last3=Winkler|title=Weak clicks in German|format=pdf|conference=Proceedings of the 16th International Congress of Phonetic Sciences|pages=449\u2013452|year=2007|location=Saarbr\u00fccken|url=http://www.icphs2007.de/conference/Papers/1678/1678.pdf}}</ref> In [[Rwanda language|Rwanda]], the sequence {{IPA|/m\u014b/}} may be pronounced either with an epenthetic vowel, {{IPA|[m\u1d4a\u014b]}}, or with a light bilabial click, {{IPA|[m\u0298\u0303\u014b]}}\u2014often by the same speaker.\n\nSpeakers of [[Gan Chinese]] from [[Ningdu]] county, as well as speakers of Mandarin from Beijing and [[Jilin]] and presumably people from other parts of the country, produce flapped nasal clicks in nursery rhymes with varying degrees of competence, in the words for 'goose' and 'duck', both of which begin with {{IPA|/\u014b/}} in Gan and until recently began with {{IPA|/\u014b/}} in Mandarin as well. In Gan, the nursery rhyme is,\n:''t\u02b0ien i ts\u02b0ak \u1d51\u01c3\u00a1o'' 'a goose in the sky'\n:''ti ha i ts\u02b0ak \u1d51\u01c3\u00a1a'' 'a duck on the ground'\n:''\u1d51\u01c3\u00a1o sa\u014b \u1d51\u01c3\u00a1o t\u02b0an, \u1d51\u01c3\u00a1o p\u02b0au \u1d51\u01c3\u00a1o'' 'a goose lays a goose egg, a goose hatches a goose'\n:''\u1d51\u01c3\u00a1a sa\u014b \u1d51\u01c3\u00a1a t\u02b0an, \u1d51\u01c3\u00a1a p\u02b0au \u1d51\u01c3\u00a1a'' 'a duck lays a duck egg, a duck hatches a duck'\nwhere the {{IPA|/\u014b/}} onsets are all pronounced {{IPA|[\u01c3\u0303\u00a1]}}.<ref>Geoffrey Nathan, 'Clicks in a Chinese Nursery Rhyme', JIPA (2001) 31/2.</ref>\n\nOccasionally other languages are claimed to have click sounds in general vocabulary. This is usually a misnomer for [[ejective consonant]]s, which are found across much of the world.\n\n=== Position in word ===\nFor the most part, the Southern African [[Khoisan languages]] only use [[root word|root]]-initial clicks.<ref group=\"note\">Exceptions occurs in words borrowed from Bantu languages, which may have click in the middle.</ref> Hadza, Sandawe and several [[Bantu languages]] also allow [[syllable]]-initial clicks within roots. In no language does a click close a syllable or end a word, but then the languages that happen to have clicks have mostly CV syllables and allow at most only a limited set of consonants (such as a nasal or a glottal stop) to close a syllable or end a word, most consonants share the distribution of clicks in these languages.\n\n=== Types of clicks used ===\nThe Khoesan families (Tuu, Kx\u02bca and Khoe) all have at least four click types, {{IPA|{\u01c0 \u01c1 \u01c3 \u01c2}}} or variants thereof. A few have five, with bilabial {{IPA|{\u0298}}} or retroflex {{IPA|{\u203c}}}. Hadza and Sandawe have three, {{IPA|{\u01c0 \u01c1 \u01c3}}}. Yeyi is the only Bantu language with four, {{IPA|{\u01c0 \u01c1 \u01c3 \u01c2}}}, while Xhosa and Zulu have three, {{IPA|{\u01c0 \u01c1 \u01c3}}}, and most Bantu languages with clicks have fewer than that.\n\n==Types of clicks==\nLike other consonants, clicks can be described using four parameters: [[place of articulation]], [[manner of articulation]], [[phonation]] (including glottalisation) and [[airstream mechanism]]. As noted above, clicks necessarily involve at least two closures, which in some cases operate partially independently: an anterior articulation traditionally represented by the special click symbol in the IPA\u2014and a posterior articulation traditionally described as oral or [[nasal consonant|nasal]], voiced or voiceless, etc. The literature also describes a contrast between [[velar consonant|velar]] and [[uvular consonant|uvular]] rear articulations for some languages.\n\nHowever, recent work shows that in languages that make this distinction, all clicks have a uvular, or even pharyngeal, rear closure\u2014and the clicks explicitly described as uvular are in fact clusters/contours of a click plus a pulmonic or ejective component, in which the cluster/contour has two release bursts, the forward (click) and then the rearward (uvular) component. \"Velar\" clicks in these languages have only a single release burst, that of the forward click release, and the release of the rear articulation isn't separately audible (Miller 2011).\n\nNonetheless, in most of the literature the stated place of the click is the anterior articulation (called the ''release'' or ''influx),'' whereas the manner is ascribed to the posterior articulation (called the ''accompaniment'' or ''efflux).'' The anterior articulation defines the ''click type'' and is written with the IPA letter for the click (dental {{angbr IPA|\u01c0}}, alveolar {{angbr IPA|\u01c3}}, etc.), whereas the traditional term 'accompaniment' conflates the categories of manner (nasal, affricated), phonation (voiced, aspirated, breathy voiced, glottalised), as well as any change in the airstream with the release of the posterior articulation (pulmonic, ejective), all of which are transcribed with additional letters or diacritics, as in the ''nasal alveolar click'', {{angbr IPA|\u01c3\u014b}} or {{angbr IPA|\u1d51\u01c3}} or\u2014to take an extreme example\u2014the ''voiced (uvular) ejective alveolar click'', {{angbr IPA|\u1da2\u01c3\u0361q\u02bc}}.\n\nThe size of click inventories ranges from as few as three (in [[Sesotho phonology#Consonants|Sesotho]]) or four (in [[Dahalo language|Dahalo]]), to dozens in the [[Kx\u02bca languages|Kx\u02bca]] and [[Tuu languages|Tuu]] (Northern and Southern Khoisan) languages. [[Taa language|Taa]], the last vibrant language in the latter family, has 45 to 115 click phonemes, depending on analysis (clusters vs. contours), and over 70% of words in the dictionary of this language begin with a click.<ref>L&M 1996, p 246</ref>\n\nClicks appear more [[stop consonant|stop]]-like (sharp/abrupt) or [[affricate]]-like (noisy) depending on their place of articulation: In southern Africa, clicks involving an [[apical consonant|apical]] [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] or [[laminal consonant|laminal]] [[postalveolar consonant|postalveolar]] closure are acoustically abrupt and sharp, like stops, whereas [[labial consonant|labial]], [[dental consonant|dental]] and [[lateral consonant|lateral]] clicks typically have longer and acoustically noisier click types that are superficially more like affricates. In East Africa, however, the alveolar clicks tend to be [[flap consonant|flapped]], whereas the lateral clicks tend to be more sharp.\n\n==Transcription==\n{{further|click letter}}\nThe five click places of articulation with dedicated symbols in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA) are [[labial click|labial]] {{IPA|\u0298}}, [[dental click|dental]] {{IPA|\u01c0}}, [[palatal click|palatal]] (\"palato-alveolar\") {{IPA|\u01c2}}, [[postalveolar click|(post)alveolar]] (\"retroflex\") {{IPA|\u01c3}} and [[lateral click|lateral]] {{IPA|\u01c1}}. In most languages, the alveolar and palatal types are abrupt; that is, they are sharp popping sounds with little frication (turbulent airflow). The labial, dental and lateral types, on the other hand, are typically noisy: they are longer, lip- or tooth-sucking sounds with turbulent airflow, and are sometimes called affricates. (This applies to the forward articulation; both may also have either an affricate or non-affricate rear articulation as well.) The [[apical consonant|apical]] places, {{IPA|\u01c3}} and {{IPA|\u01c1}}, are sometimes called \"grave\", because their pitch is dominated by low frequencies; whereas the [[laminal consonant|laminal]] places, {{IPA|\u01c0}} and {{IPA|\u01c2}}, are sometimes called \"acute\", because they are dominated by high frequencies. (At least in the [[N\u01c1ng language]] and [[Ju\u01c0\u02bchoan language|Ju\u01c0\u02bchoan]], this is associated with a difference in the placement of the rear articulation: \"grave\" clicks are [[uvular consonant|uvular]], whereas \"acute\" clicks are [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]].) Thus the alveolar click {{IPA|/\u01c3/}} sounds something like a cork pulled from a bottle (a low-pitch pop), at least in Xhosa; whereas the dental click {{IPA|/\u01c0/}} is like English ''tsk! tsk!,'' a high-pitched sucking on the incisors. The lateral clicks are pronounced by sucking on the molars of one or both sides. The labial click {{IPA|/\u0298/}} is different from what many people associate with a kiss: the lips are pressed more-or-less flat together, as they are for a {{IPA|[p]}} or an {{IPA|[m]}}, not rounded as they are for a {{IPA|[w]}}.\n\nThe most populous languages with clicks, Zulu and Xhosa, use the letters ''c, q, x,'' by themselves and in [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]], to write click consonants. Most Khoisan languages, on the other hand (with the notable exceptions of [[Naro language|Naro]] and [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]]), use a more iconic system based on the [[Vertical bar|pipe]] {{angbr|<nowiki>|</nowiki>}}. (The exclamation point for the \"retroflex\" click was originally a pipe with a subscript dot, along the lines of ''\u1e6d, \u1e0d, \u1e47'' used to transcribe the retroflex consonants of India.) There are also two main conventions for the second letter of the digraph as well: voicing may be written with ''g'' and uvular affrication with ''x'', or voicing with ''d'' and affrication with ''g'' (a convention of Afrikaans). In two orthographies of Ju\u01c0\u02bchoan, for example, {{IPA|/\u01c3\u032c/}} is written ''g!'' or ''dq'', and {{IPA|/\u01c3\u0361\u03c7/}} ''!x'' or ''qg''. In languages without {{IPA|/\u01c3\u0361\u03c7/}}, such as Zulu, {{IPA|/\u01c3\u032c/}} may be written ''gq''.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|+ Competing orthographies\n!rowspan=2| !!rowspan=2|labial!!colspan=2|laminal!!colspan=2|apical !!subapical\n|-\n!dental!!palatal!!alveolar!!lateral!!retroflex\n|- align=center\n!

Former text: ''such as a noisy laminal denti-alveolar lateral articulation ({{angbr IPA|\u2980}} in an ''ad hoc'' transcription), which contrasts with an apical postalveolar lateral in Mangetti Dune !Kung;''--> A reported subapical retroflex articulation {{angbr IPA|\u203c}} in Grootfontein !Kung<ref group=note>{{angbr|\u2980}} (a triple pipe) in Cole (1966) may have been the same thing.

However, the Khoisan languages are poorly attested, and it is quite possible that, as they become better described, more click articulations will be found.\n\nFormerly when a click consonant was transcribed, two symbols were used, one for each articulation, and connected with a tie bar. This is because a click such as {{IPA|[\u014b\u0361\u01c2]}} was analysed as a nasal velar rear articulation {{IPA|[\u014b]}} pronounced simultaneously with the forward ingressive release {{IPA|[\u01c2]}}. The symbols may be written in either order, depending on the analysis: {{angbr IPA|\u014b\u0361\u01c2}} or {{angbr IPA|\u01c2\u0361\u014b}}. However, a tie bar was not often used in practice, and when the manner is [[tenuis consonant|tenuis]] (a simple {{IPA|[k]}}), it was often omitted as well. That is, {{angbr IPA|\u01c2}} = {{angbr IPA|k\u01c2}} = {{angbr IPA|\u01c2k}} = {{angbr IPA|k\u0361\u01c2}} = {{angbr IPA|\u01c2\u0361k}}. Regardless, elements that do not overlap with the forward release are usually written according to their temporal order: Prenasalisation is always written first ({{angbr IPA|\u014b\u0261\u0361\u01c2}} = {{angbr IPA|\u014b\u01c2\u0361\u0261}} = {{angbr IPA|\u014b\u01c2\u032c}}), and the non-lingual part of a contour is always written second ({{angbr IPA|k\u0361\u01c2\u02bcq\u02bc}} = {{angbr IPA|\u01c2\u0361k\u02bcq\u02bc}} = {{angbr IPA|\u01c2\u0361q\u02bc}}).\n\nHowever, it has become standard to analyse clicks as simplex segments, as research has shown that the front and rear articulations are not independent, and to use click symbols to cover the rear articulation as well, with diacritics rather than digraphs for the accompaniments. At first this tended to be {{angbr IPA|\u01c2, \u1da2\u01c2, \u1d51\u01c2}} for {{angbr IPA|k\u0361\u01c2, \u0261\u0361\u01c2, \u014b\u0361\u01c2}}, based on the belief that the rear articulation was velar; but as it has become clear that the rear articulation of both \"velar\" and \"uvular\" clicks is actually uvular or even pharyngeal, voicing and nasalisation diacritics more in keeping with the IPA have started to appear: {{angbr IPA|\u01c2, \u01c2\u032c, \u01c2\u0303, \u014b\u01c2\u032c}} for {{angbr IPA|\u01c2, \u1da2\u01c2, \u1d51\u01c2, \u014b\u1da2\u01c2}}.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable IPA\"\n|+Evolution of accompaniment transcription\n|-\n! !!

Since then there has been some conflicting variation. Here are the terms used in some of the main references.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! Click type !! Bantu letters !!

However, the palatal and alveolar clicks frequently have the opposite names in older literature, and they were not distinguished in the IPA until 1989. However, since Ladefoged & Traill (1984) clarified the places of articulation, the terms in the left column above have become standard.<ref group=note>A current exception is [[Unicode]], which still calls the palatal clicks 'alveolar' and the alveolar clicks 'retroflex'.</ref>\n\n==The back-vowel constraint==\n[[Image:Clicks and the BVC.svg|thumb|The shape of the tongue in Nama when articulating an alveolar click (blue) and a palatal click (red) [throat to the right]. The articulation of the vowel {{IPA|[i]}} is slightly forward of the red line, with its peak coinciding with the dip of the blue line.]]\nIn several languages, including [[Nama language|Nama]] and [[Ju\u01c0\u02bchoan dialect|Ju\u01c0\u02bchoan]], the alveolar click types {{IPA|[\u01c3]}} and {{IPA|[\u01c1]}} only occur, or preferentially occur, before [[back vowel]]s, whereas the dental and palatal clicks occur before any vowel. The effect is most noticeable with the high front vowel {{IPA|[i]}}. In Nama, for example, the diphthong {{IPA|[\u0259i]}} is common but {{IPA|[i]}} is rare after alveolar clicks, whereas the opposite is true after dental and palatal clicks. This is a common effect of [[uvular consonant|uvular]] or uvularised consonants on vowels in both click and non-click languages. In [[Taa language|Taa]], for example, the back-vowel constraint is triggered by both alveolar clicks and uvular stops, but not by palatal clicks or velar stops: sequences such as {{IPA|*/\u01c3i/}} and {{IPA|*/qi/}} are rare to non-existent, whereas sequences such as {{IPA|/\u01c2i/}} and {{IPA|/ki/}} are common. It is also triggered by labial clicks, though not by labial stops. Clicks subject to this constraint involve a sharp [[retracted tongue root|retraction]] of the tongue during release.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable IPA\"\n! !!Abrupt <br>release!!Noisy <br>release\n|-\n|ballistic tongue retraction<br>& back-vowel constraint\n|align=center|\u01c3||align=center|\u01c1, \u0298\n|-\n|no retraction, no constraint\n|align=center|\u01c2||align=center|\u01c0\n|}\n\nMiller and colleagues (2003) used [[ultrasound imaging]] to show that the rear articulation of the alveolar clicks ({{IPA|[\u01c3]}}) in Nama is substantially different from that of palatal and dental clicks. Specifically, the shape of the body of the tongue in palatal clicks is very similar to that of the vowel {{IPA|[i]}}, and involves the same tongue muscles, so that sequences such as {{IPA|[\u01c2i]}} involved a simple and quick transition. The rear articulation of the alveolar clicks, however, is several centimetres further back, and involves a different set of muscles in the uvular region. The part of the tongue required to approach the palate for the vowel {{IPA|[i]}} is deeply retracted in {{IPA|[\u01c3]}}, as it lies at the bottom of the air pocket used to create the vacuum required for click airstream. This makes the transition required for {{IPA|[\u01c3i]}} much more complex and the timing more difficult than the shallower and more forward tongue position of the palatal clicks. Consequently, {{IPA|[\u01c3i]}} takes 50 [[millisecond|ms]] longer to pronounce than {{IPA|[\u01c2i]}}, the same amount of time required to pronounce {{IPA|[\u01c3\u0259i]}}.\n\nLanguages do not all behave alike. In [[N\u01c1ng language|N\u01c0uu]], the simple clicks {{IPA|/\u0298, \u01c3, \u01c1/}} trigger the {{IPA|[\u0259i]}} and {{IPA|[\u00e6]}} allophones of {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/e/}}, whereas {{IPA|/\u01c0, \u01c2/}} do not. All of the affricated contour clicks, such as {{IPA|/\u01c2\u0361\u03c7/}}, do as well, as do the uvular stops {{IPA|/q, \u03c7/}}. However, the occlusive contour clicks pattern like the simple clicks, and {{IPA|/\u01c2\u0361q/}} does not trigger the back-vowel constraint. This is because they involve tongue-root raising rather than [[Advanced and retracted tongue root|tongue-root retraction]] in the uvular-pharyngeal region. However, in [[G\u01c0wi dialect|G\u01c0wi]], which is otherwise largely similar, both {{IPA|/\u01c2\u0361q/}} and {{IPA|/\u01c2\u0361\u03c7/}} trigger the back-vowel constraint (Miller 2009).\n\n==Manners of articulation==\n{{main|nasal click|glottalised click|pulmonic-contour click|ejective-contour click}}\nClick manners are often called click ''accompaniments'' or ''effluxes'', but both terms have met with objections on theoretical grounds.\n\nThere is a great variety of click manners, both simplex and complex, the latter variously analysed as consonant [[consonant cluster|clusters]] or [[contour (linguistics)|contours]]. With so few click languages, and so little study of them, it is also unclear to what extent clicks in different languages are equivalent. For example, the {{IPA|[\u01c3k\u02c0]}} of Khoekhoe, {{IPA|[\u01c3k\u02c0 ~ \u014b\u02c0\u01c3k]}} of Sandawe and {{IPA|[\u014b\u030a\u01c3\u02c0 ~ \u014b\u01c3k\u02c0]}} of Hadza may be essentially the same phone; no language distinguishes them, and the differences in transcription may have more to do with the approach of the linguist than with actual differences in the sounds. Such suspected allophones/allographs are listed on a common row in the table below.\n\nSome Khoisan languages are [[Linguistic typology|typologically]] unusual in allowing mixed [[phonation|voicing]] in non-click consonant clusters/contours, such as {{IPA|dt\u0361s\u02bck\u0361x\u02bc}}, so it is not surprising that they would allow mixed voicing in clicks as well. This may be an effect of epiglottalised voiced consonants, because voicing is incompatible with epiglottalisation.\n\n===Phonation===\nAs do other consonants, clicks vary in [[phonation]]. Oral clicks are attested with four phonations: [[tenuis consonant|tenuis]], [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]], [[voiced consonant|voiced]] and [[breathy voice]]d (murmured). Nasal clicks may also vary, with plain voiced, breathy voiced / murmured nasal, aspirated and unaspirated voiceless clicks attested (the last only in Taa). The aspirated nasal clicks are often said to have 'delayed aspiration'; there is nasal airflow throughout the click, which may become voiced between vowels, though the aspiration itself is voiceless. A few languages also have pre-glottalised nasal clicks, which have very brief prenasalisation<!--creaky-voiced nasal?--> but have not been phonetically analysed to the extent that other types of clicks have.\n\nAll languages have nasal clicks, and all but [[Dahalo language|Dahalo]] and [[Damin]] also have oral clicks. All languages but Damin have at least one phonation contrast as well.\n\n===Complex clicks===\nClicks may be pronounced with a third place of articulation, glottal. A [[glottal stop]] is made during the hold of the click; the (necessarily voiceless) click is released, and then the glottal hold is released into the vowel. Glottalised clicks are very common, and they are generally nasalised as well. The nasalisation cannot be heard during the click release, as there is no pulmonic airflow, and generally not at all when the click occurs at the beginning of an utterance, but it has the effect of nasalising preceding vowels, to the extent that the glottalised clicks of Sandawe and Hadza are often described as prenasalised when in medial position. Two languages, [[G\u01c0wi dialect|G\u01c0wi]] and [[Yeyi language|Yeyi]], contrast plain and nasal glottalised clicks, but in languages without such a contrast, the glottalised click is nasal. Miller (2011) analyses the glottalisation as phonation, and so considers these to be simple clicks.\n\nVarious languages also have prenasalised clicks, which may be analysed as consonant sequences. [[Sotho language|Sotho]], for example, allows a syllabic nasal before its three clicks, as in ''nnqane'' 'the other side' (prenasalised nasal) and ''seqhenqha'' 'hunk'.\n\nThere is ongoing discussion as to how the distinction between what were historically described as 'velar' and 'uvular' clicks is best described. The 'uvular' clicks are only found in some languages, and have an extended pronunciation that suggests that they are more complex than the simple ('velar') clicks, which are found in all. Nakagawa (1996) describes the extended clicks in [[G\u01c0wi dialect|G\u01c0wi]] as [[consonant cluster]]s, sequences equivalent to English ''st'' or ''pl'', whereas Miller (2011) analyses similar sounds in several languages as click\u2013non-click [[contour (linguistics)|contours]], where a click transitions into a pulmonic or ejective articulation within a single segment, analogous to how English ''ch'' and ''j'' transition from occlusive to fricative but still behave as unitary sounds. With ejective clicks, for example, Miller finds that although the ejective release follows the click release, it is the rear closure of the click that is ejective, not an independently articulated consonant. That is, in a simple click, the release of the rear articulation is not audible, whereas in a contour click, the rear (uvular) articulation is audibly released after the front (click) articulation, resulting in a double release.\n\nThese contour clicks may be ''linguo-pulmonic'', that is, they may transition from a click (lingual) articulation to a normal pulmonic consonant like {{IPAblink|q}} (e.g. {{IPA|[\u01c2\u0361q]}}); or ''linguo-glottalic'' and transition from lingual to an ejective consonant like {{IPAblink|q\u02bc}} (e.g. {{IPA|[\u01c2\u0361q\u02bc]}}): that is, a sequence of ingressive (lingual) release + egressive (pulmonic or glottalic) release. In some cases there is a shift in place of articulation as well, and instead of a uvular release, the uvular click transitions to a velar or [[Epiglottal consonant|epigottal]] release (depending on the description, {{IPA|[\u01c2\u0361kx\u02bc]}} or {{IPA|[\u01c2\u1d34]}}). Although [[homorganic]] {{IPA|[\u01c2\u0361\u03c7\u02bc]}} does not contrast with heterorganic {{IPA|[\u01c2\u0361kx\u02bc]}} in any known language, they are phonetically quite distinct (Miller 2011).\n\nApart from Dahalo, Damin and many of the Bantu languages (Yeyi and Xhosa being exceptions), 'click' languages have glottalised clicks. Contour clicks are restricted to southern Africa, but are very common there: they are found in all members of the Tuu, Kx\u02bca and Khoe families, as well as in the Bantu language Yeyi.\n\n===Variation among languages===\nIn a comparative study of clicks across various languages, using her own field work as well as phonetic descriptions and data by other field researchers, Miller (2011) posits 21 types of clicks that contrast in manner or airstream.<ref group=note>Not counting the egressive \"spurt\" in Damin, and tree additional voiced manners in Western \u01c3Xoo, which pair up with voiceless manners.</ref> The [[homorganic]] and heterorganic affricated ejective clicks do not contrast in any known language, but are judged dissimilar enough to keep separate.

The original researchers believe that {{IPA|[\ua7b0\u02b0]}} and {{IPA|[\ua7b0\u03c7]}} are allophones.\n\nA DoBeS (2008) study of the Western \u01c3Xoo dialect of Taa found several new manners: creaky voiced (the voiced equivalent of glottalised oral), breathy-voiced nasal, prenasalised glottalised (the voiced equivalent of glottalised) and a (pre)voiced ejective. These extra voiced clicks reflect Western \u01c3Xoo morphology, where many nouns form their plural by voicing their initial consonant. DoBeS analyses most Taa clicks as clusters, leaving nine basic manners (marked with asterisks in the table). This comes close to Miller's distinction between simple and contour clicks, shaded light and medium grey in the table.\n\n==Phonotactics==\nLanguages of the southern African Khoisan families only permit clicks at the beginning of a word root. However, they also restrict other classes of consonant, such as [[ejective consonant|ejectives]] and [[affricate]]s, to root-initial position. The Bantu languages, Hadza and Sandawe allow clicks within roots.\n\nIn some languages, all click consonants within known roots are the same phoneme, as in Hadza ''cikiringcingca'' {{IPA|/\u01c0iki\u027aiN.\u01c0iN.\u01c0a/}} 'pinkie finger', which has three [[tenuis dental click]]s. Other languages are known to have the occasional root with different clicks, as in Xhosa ''ugqwanxa'' {{IPA|/u\u1da2\u030a\u01c3\u02b1\u02b7a\u1d51\u01c1a/}} '[[Olea capensis|black ironwood]]', which has a slack-[[voiced alveolar click]] and a [[nasal lateral click]].\n\nLike other articulatorily complex consonants, clicks tend to be found in [[lexical words]] rather than in [[grammatical word]]s, but this is only a tendency. In [[N\u01c1ng language|N\u01c1ng]], for example, there are two sets of [[personal pronoun]]s, a full one without clicks and a partial set with clicks (''\u0144g'' 'I', ''\u00e1'' 'thou', ''\u00ed'' 'we all', ''\u00fa'' 'you', vs. ''n\u01c0\u01f9g'' 'I', ''g\u01c0\u00e0'' 'thou', ''g\u01c0\u00ec'' 'we all', ''g\u01c0\u00f9'' 'you'), as well as other grammatical words with clicks such as ''\u01c1u'' 'not' and ''n\u01c0a'' 'with, and'.\n\n==Click genesis and click loss==\nOne genetic study concluded that clicks, which occur in the languages of the genetically divergent populations Hadza and !Kung, may be an ancient element of human language.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Tishkoff |first=S.

M. |last4=Mortensen |first4=H. |last5=Knight |first5=A. |last6=Gignoux |first6=C. |last7=Fernandopulle |first7=N. |displayauthors=3 |year=2007 |title=History of click-speaking populations of Africa inferred from mtDNA and Y chromosome genetic variation |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=24 |issue=10 |pages=2180\u201395 |doi=10.1093/molbev/msm155 |pmid=17656633 }}</ref> However, this conclusion relies on several dubious assumptions (see [[Hadza language]]), and most linguists{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} assume that clicks, being quite complex consonants, arose relatively late in human history. How they arose is not known, but it is generally assumed that they developed from sequences of non-click consonants, as they are found allophonically for [[doubly articulated consonant]]s in West Africa,{{sfn|Ladefoged|1968}} where {{IPA|/tk/}} sequences overlap at word boundaries in German,<ref name=germ /> and for the sequence {{IPA|/mw/}} in [[Ndau language|Ndau]] and [[Tonga language (Zambia)|Tonga]].<ref group=note>Here the labial {{IPA|[m]}} may have assimilated to the velar place of the {{IPA|[w]}}, as {{IPA|[m\u0361\u014bw]}}, with the release of the labial before the velar later generating a click {{IPA|[\u1d50\u0298w]}}</ref> Such developments have also been posited in historical reconstruction. For example, the [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]] word for 'horn', {{IPA|/t\u026cana/}}, with a lateral affricate, may be a cognate with the root {{IPA|/\u1d51\u01c1a\u02d0/}} found throughout the [[Khoe languages|Khoe family]], which has a lateral click. This and other words suggests that at least some Khoe clicks may have formed from consonant clusters when the first vowel of a word was lost; in this instance *{{IPA|[t\u026cana]}} > *{{IPA|[t\u026cna]}} > {{IPA|[\u01c1\u014ba] ~ [\u1d51\u01c1a]}}.\n\nOn the other side of the equation, several non-endangered languages in vigorous use demonstrate click loss. For example, the [[Khoe languages|East Kalahari languages]] have lost clicks from a large percentage of their vocabulary, presumably due to [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] influence. As a rule, a click is replaced by a consonant with close to the [[manner of articulation]] of the click and the [[place of articulation]] of the forward release: alveolar click releases (the {{IPA|[\u01c3]}} family) tend to mutate into a velar stop or affricate, such as {{IPA|[k], [\u0261], [\u014b], [k\u0361x]}}; palatal clicks ({{IPA|[\u01c2]}} ''etc.'') tend to mutate into a palatal stop such as {{IPA|[c], [&thinsp;\u025f], [&thinsp;\u0272], [c\u02bc]}}, or a post-alveolar affricate {{IPA|[t\u0283], [d\u0292]}}; and dental clicks ({{IPA|[\u01c0]}} ''etc.'') tend to mutate into an alveolar affricate {{IPA|[ts]}}.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\n==Difficulty==\nClicks are often presented as difficult sounds to articulate within words. However, children acquire them readily; a two-year-old, for example, may be able to pronounce a word with a lateral click {{IPA|[\u01c1]}} with no problem, but still be unable to pronounce {{IPA|[s]}}.<ref>Kirk Miller, 'Highlights of Hadza fieldwork'. ''LSA'', San Francisco, 2009.</ref> [[Lucy Lloyd]] reported that after long contact with the Khoi and San, it was difficult for her to refrain from using clicks when speaking English.<ref>Beach (1938), p 269.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col||colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Dental click]]s\n* [[Alveolar click]]s\n* [[Fricated alveolar click]]s\n* [[Retroflex click]]s\n* [[Lateral click]]s\n* [[Palatal click]]s\n* [[Labial click]]s\n* [[Nasal click]]s\n* [[Glottalised click]]s\n* [[Pulmonic-contour click]]s\n* [[Ejective-contour click]]s\n* [[Click letter]]s\n* [[List of phonetics topics]]\n* [[Sublaminal lower alveolar click]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book|last=Ladefoged|first=Peter|year=1968|title=A phonetic study of West African languages: An auditory-instrumental survey|edition= 2nd|ISBN=0-521-06963-7|ref=harv}}\n* {{SOWL}}\n* Amanda Miller, Levi Namaseb, Khalil Iskarous. 2003.

The brand was renamed 'Cumberbatch Kids' when the dolls went into mass production in 1982. The brand was originally started by Hollywood Superstar [[Benedict Cumberbatch]]'s Great Uncle Henry. We actually have this man to thank for [[benedict Cumberbatch]]'s success after Henry Cumberbatch used his fortune to move Benedict into a flat in London, from where he attended his first auditions.  \n\nThe doll brand was one of the most popular toy [[fad]]s of the 1980s and one of the longest-running doll franchises in the United States.<ref>{{cite news|title= Top 10 Toy Crazes|work= Time|date=2009-12-14|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1947621_1947626_1947588,00.html|accessdate=2010-03-03}}</ref> The characters appeared in many other Cabbage Patch merchandising products ranging from animated cartoons to record albums to board games.\n\n==Production history==\n\n===Creation and development===\nAccording to Roberts, as a 21-year-old art student, he utilized the quilting skills he learned from his mother and the historic technique of \"needle molding\" to develop his own line of fabric sculptures. He called these hand-stitched, one-of-a-kind, soft fabric sculptures \"The Little People\". (Other soft sculpture dolls dating back to the 19th century were created using similar needle molding techniques.) His Little People were not offered for sale, but were \"adopted\" each with their own individual name and birth certificate.  Instead of paying a purchase price, buyers of Little People would have to pay an adoption fee.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/parenting/the-cabbage-patch-kids-twisted-history-117266351832.html|title=The Cabbage Patch Kids' Twisted History|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe Little People were first sold at arts and crafts shows, then later at [[Babyland General Hospital]], an old medical clinic that Roberts and his friends-turned-employees converted into a toy store, in [[Cleveland, Georgia]].<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cabbagepatchkids.com/pages/History_folklore/Milestones/milestones.html |title=Our History |accessdate=February 22, 2008 |publisher=Babyland General Hospital |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218053854/http://www.cabbagepatchkids.com/pages/History_folklore/Milestones/milestones.html |archivedate=February 18, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAn early transaction at Babyland General Hospital worth noting is the sale of the only Little People quintuplets ever made at the facility.  Bennie and Jeannie Shelton of Cumming, Georgia paid $5,000 to buy the one-of-a-kind set of five identical dolls.  Also worth noting is one of Roberts' very first Little People dolls he ever created sold at an auction in Virginia in the early 1980s for $3,000.\n\nAccording to the discovery legend Roberts came up with for his Little People, and later reproduced on every Cabbage Patch Kids product from 1983 onward:\n\n<blockquote>Xavier Roberts was a ten-year-old boy who discovered the Cabbage Patch Kids by following a BunnyBee behind a waterfall into a magical Cabbage Patch, where he found the Cabbage Patch babies being born. To help them find good homes he built BabyLand General in Cleveland, Georgia where the Cabbage Patch Kids could live and play until they were adopted. BunnyBees are bee-like creatures with rabbit ears they use as wings. They pollinate cabbages with their magic crystals to make Cabbage Patch babies. Colonel Casey is a large stork who oversees Babyland General Hospital. He's the narrator of the Cabbage Patch Kids' story.  Otis Lee is the leader of the gang of Cabbage Patch Kids that befriended Xavier.</blockquote>\n\n===Coleco years===\nThe name change to Cabbage Patch Kids was made in 1982 when Xavier's company, Original Appalachian Artworks, began to license a smaller version of the handmade creations to a toy manufacturer named [[Coleco]] which began mass production the same year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accessnorthga.com/detail.php?n=213040&c=10|title=Cleveland's Cabbage Patch Kids turn 25|publisher=AccessNorthGA.com|date=2008-09-07|accessdate=2010-08-07}}</ref> The Coleco Cabbage Patch Kids had large, round [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] heads (originally of a different, hard plastic), and soft fabric bodies, and were produced from 1982 to 1989, many at a factory in [[Amsterdam, New York]]. The first two years production was all from the Far East, with nine head variations produced and computer-matched with bodies to ensure each doll was \"different\". It was, in fact, a marketing ploy that worked quite well as a wide range of variations resulted. (Source: Larry Moniz, then senior account supervisor for the Coleco account at Richard Weiner Public Relations in NYC.)\n\nAt the peak of their popularity, the dolls were a must-have [[toy]] for [[Christmas]].<ref>{{cite news |title= Booming Sales in Toyland |work= Time|date=1984-12-10 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,955377,00.html|accessdate=2010-03-03 | first1=John S. | last1=DeMott | first2=Other | last2=Bureaus | first3=Rosemary | last3=Byrnes}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title= TOYS: Trouble in the Cabbage Patch|work=Time|date=1988-05-16 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,967387,00.html |accessdate=2010-03-03}}</ref> Parents across the [[United States]] flocked to stores to try to obtain one of the Cabbage Patch Kids for their children, with fights occasionally erupting between parents over the hard-to-find dolls. In later years, Coleco introduced variants on the original Cabbage Patch Kids, and derivatives of the original line of dolls continued to be marketed.\n\n===International variations===\nIn the 1980s when [[Coleco]] was producing the dolls for the North American market, the global craze was fulfilled by other companies:\n* Jesmar Toy Company made the dolls for the European Market, including Spain, Italy, and West Germany.\n* Lili Ledy Toy Company made the dolls for Mexico and South America.\n* Triang-Pedigree Toy Company made the dolls for South Africa.\n* Tsukuda Toy Company manufactured the dolls for Japan and Asia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mycpkcollection.weebly.com/cpk-info.html |title=Collector information, identification - My Cabbage Patch Kids |publisher=Mycpkcollection.weebly.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-19}}</ref>\nThe Dolls manufactured by each of these companies, and along with the factories that produced the dolls for North America, produced dolls that were slightly different from one another. Dolls that were made for consumers in other countries than the United States hold a higher value in the eye of some American collectors.\n\n===Hasbro years===\n[[Hasbro]] took over the rights to produce Cabbage Patch dolls in 1988 after Coleco filed for [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy,<ref name=coleco-chapter11>{{cite news|title= Cabbage Patch Doll Maker Is Bankrupt |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=1988-07-12|url= https://articles.latimes.com/1988-07-12/news/mn-5746_1_cabbage-patch-kids|accessdate=2013-11-12}}</ref> and continued to make the dolls with various gimmicks, including dolls that played [[kazoo]]s. Some of the more popular doll lines to come out under the Cabbage Patch Kids name included the \"Birthday Kids\", \"Splash 'n' Tan Kids\", and \"Pretty Crimp and Curl\". Hasbro gradually began making the dolls for younger children, which led to smaller and smaller dolls.  Although Cabbage Patch dolls were still best selling toys, Hasbro never really revitalized the Cabbage Patch market. In 1994, [[Mattel]] acquired the licensing rights to the dolls from Original Appalachian Artworks.\n{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n===Mattel years===\nIn 1994, Mattel took over the Cabbage Patch [[brand]], including production. The first Mattel Cabbage Patch dolls hit the stores in 1995.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nThe Mattel Cabbage Patch dolls are not limited to cloth bodies and included dolls made from [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]], which produced a more durable play doll. The Mattel dolls are mostly sized 14\" or smaller, and most variants were individualized with a [[gimmick]] to enhance their collectibility, e.g. some dolls played on water-toys, swam, ate food, or brushed their teeth.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nSome memorable Mattel lines include the updated Kids line of basic cloth dolls that came with [[birth certificates]], the OlympiKids that were made to coincide with the [[1996 Olympics]], and the Cabbage Patch [[Flower|Fairies]]. Additionally, to celebrate the dolls' 15th anniversary, Mattel created a line of exclusively female dolls with a new molded fabric face, dressed in a custom outfits and packaged in collectible boxes. These were 16 inches tall, the same measurement of the first Coleco Cabbage Patch Kids.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n===Toys \"R\" Us Kids===\nIn 2001, retailer [[Toys \"R\" Us]] took over the Cabbage Patch brand from Mattel, producing 20-inch Kids and 18-inch babies, both with cloth bodies and vinyl heads. They were packaged in cardboard [[cabbage leaf]] seats. In 2001, the 20-inch dolls debuted in the [[Times Square]] flagship store. These were created to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the line, and were available both [[online]] and in stores around the US.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n===Play Along Toys===\nThe Toys \"R\" Us line lasted until [[Play Along]] toys obtained exclusive licensing rights to produce the Cabbage Patch Kids doll line. In 2003, Play Along launched a Cabbage Patch Kids 25th Anniversary collection using some of the original head sculpts from the very first Coleco editions. Play Along also partnered with [[Carvel Ice Cream]] in a co-branding campaign.  The resulting co-branded Cabbage Patch Kids were packaged with a Carvel-branded ice cream cone.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n===Jakks Pacific===\nJAKKS Pacific acquired Play Along Toys and assumed the master toy licensee (c2011) for the Cabbage Patch Kids.  Jakks introduced a 14-inch Cabbage Patch Kids Fashionality(TM) line and other Cabbage Patch Kid products. In 2013 Jakks Pacific released the Celebration edition to commemorate the 30th Birthday of the licensed Cabbage Patch Kids. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n===Wicked Cool Toys===\nWicked Cool Toys is now the current master toy licensee for the Cabbage Patch Kids.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kidscreen.com/2015/02/10/wicked-cool-toys-adopts-cabbage-patch-kids/ |title=Archive \u00bb Wicked Cool Toys adopts Cabbage Patch Kids |publisher=Kidscreen |date=2015-02-10 |accessdate=2016-03-19}}</ref>\n\nIn this line, WCT released new additions like Little Sprouts, a toyline of tiny collectable dolls, and Adoptimals, plush pets who interact with the Kids.\n\n==Cabbage Patch Kids brand==\nThe original 1982 Cabbage Patch Kids [[license agreement]] with Coleco Industries was negotiated by Roger L. Schlaifer on behalf of Schlaifer Nance & Company, the exclusive worldwide licensing agent for Roberts' company at the time.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nFollowing Schlaifer Nance & Company's signing of Coleco Industries, SN&C signed over one hundred and fifty licenses for branded products ranging from the first children's licensed character [[diapers]] and low-sugar cereal to clothing, backyard pools, and thousands of other children's products \u2013 generating over $2 billion in retail sales for 1984, alone. Total sales during the Schlaifers' tenure exceeded $4.5 billion. While sales of the dolls and other licensed products declined precipitously in the late 1980s, the dolls have become a mainstay of the toy industry, and one of the few long-running doll brands in history.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=abYKXvCwEToC&pg=PA84&lpg=PA84&dq=cabbage+patch+kids+4.5+billion&source=bl&ots=jGzcuD2oLr&sig=PJB4oxSbSdj84zxeN7tHOt6suHo&hl=lv&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj8wP7LkOzOAhVnMJoKHXPqA5oQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&q=cabbage%20patch%20kids%204.5%20billion&f=false|title=Harry Potter: The Story of a Global Business Phenomenon|publisher=Susan Gunelius|accessdate=August 31, 2016|isbn=978-0-230-59410-4}}</ref>\n\n==Porcelain Cabbage Patch Kids==\nThese dolls were available by [[direct mail]] from the [[Danbury Mint]]. They have a rigid fabric body with [[porcelain]] legs, arms, and head.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n==Talking Cabbage Patch Kids==\nAn extension to the line was the \"Talking Cabbage Patch Kid\" introduced by Coleco, equipped with a voice chip, touch sensors, a microphone, short range 49&nbsp;MHz AM transmitter and receiver for communicating with other such dolls. Touch sensors in the hands enabled the toy to detect when and how it was being played with in response to its vocalizations. For example, the doll might say \"hold my hand\" and give an appropriate speech response when the touch sensor in either hand detected pressure. It also had a movement detector to show the positioning of the doll and whether it was sensed to be on its belly, back, or even upside down. A special plastic 'drinking' cup containing a hidden magnet, which could be identified with the aid a small reed relay in the built into the head of the toy above the mouth, to signify when it should be seen to be 'drinking'. A more remarkable effect occurred when one doll detected the presence of another through its 49&nbsp;MHz AM transmitter/receiver. The dolls were programmed to signal their \"awareness\" of each other with a short phrase, e.g. \"I think there's someone else to play with here!\", and then to initiate simple conversations ''between the dolls themselves'' with enough randomness to sound somewhat natural. The joint synchronised singing of 'rounds' being particularly impressive. The inclusion of the microphone was to delay the search and communication with another of its type when the ambient noise was above a certain level.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n==Babyland General Hospital==\n[[Babyland General Hospital]] is the \"birthplace\" of Cabbage Patch Kids and is located in [[Cleveland, Georgia]]. Roberts converted an old clinic into a \"hospital\" from which to sell his dolls, originally called \"Little People\". The facility is presented as a [[birth]]ing, [[Nursery (room)|nursery]], and [[adoption]] center for the Cabbage Patch Kids. In accordance with the theme, employees dress and act the parts of the doctors and nurses caring for the dolls as if they are real. Babyland General moved to a new facility on the outskirts of Cleveland, Georgia in 2010 and has been voted one of the Travel Channel's top 10 toylands.\n\n==Controversies==\n{{See also|Cabbage Patch riots}}\n\n=== Lawsuits ===\nThough Xavier Roberts was the creator of the Cabbage Patch Kids brand, many of the brand's defining characteristics \u2013 such as the dolls' overly round faces and that they came with an [[adoption]] certificate \u2013 were taken from [[Martha Nelson Thomas]], an American folk artist from [[Kentucky]]. Before Roberts became involved in the toy industry, Thomas had created and marketed her own line of dolls, called Doll Babies, which she sold at local arts and craft shows and markets. The two crossed paths at a state fair in 1976, whereupon Roberts began purchasing Thomas' dolls to sell at a profit at his own store in Georgia.<ref>\"The Secret History of Cabbage Patch Dolls\" May 10, 2015 Vice.https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8gk4dk/the-secret-history-of-cabbage-patch-kids-011</ref><ref>Piro, Lauren.\"The Not-So-Sweet Truth About Cabbage Patch Kids: Behind those iconic chubby cheeks is a disappointing story\" Apr 21, 2015.

The brand was renamed 'Cabbage Patch Kids' when the dolls went into mass production in 1982. The dolls were based upon a design originally created by [[Martha Nelson Thomas]]. \n\nThe doll brand was one of the most popular toy [[fad]]s of the 1980s and one of the longest-running doll franchises in the United States.<ref>{{cite news|title= Top 10 Toy Crazes|work= Time|date=2009-12-14|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1947621_1947626_1947588,00.html|accessdate=2010-03-03}}</ref> The characters appeared in many other Cabbage Patch merchandising products ranging from animated cartoons to record albums to board games.\n\n==Production history==\n\n===Creation and development===\nAccording to Roberts, as a 21-year-old art student, he utilized the quilting skills he learned from his mother and the historic technique of \"needle molding\" to develop his own line of fabric sculptures. He called these hand-stitched, one-of-a-kind, soft fabric sculptures \"The Little People\". (Other soft sculpture dolls dating back to the 19th century were created using similar needle molding techniques.) His Little People were not offered for sale, but were \"adopted\" each with their own individual name and birth certificate.  Instead of paying a purchase price, buyers of Little People would have to pay an adoption fee.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/parenting/the-cabbage-patch-kids-twisted-history-117266351832.html|title=The Cabbage Patch Kids' Twisted History|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe Little People were first sold at arts and crafts shows, then later at [[Babyland General Hospital]], an old medical clinic that Roberts and his friends-turned-employees converted into a toy store, in [[Cleveland, Georgia]].<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cabbagepatchkids.com/pages/History_folklore/Milestones/milestones.html |title=Our History |accessdate=February 22, 2008 |publisher=Babyland General Hospital |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218053854/http://www.cabbagepatchkids.com/pages/History_folklore/Milestones/milestones.html |archivedate=February 18, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAn early transaction at Babyland General Hospital worth noting is the sale of the only Little People quintuplets ever made at the facility.  Bennie and Jeannie Shelton of Cumming, Georgia paid $5,000 to buy the one-of-a-kind set of five identical dolls.  Also worth noting is one of Roberts' very first Little People dolls he ever created sold at an auction in Virginia in the early 1980s for $3,000.\n\nAccording to the discovery legend Roberts came up with for his Little People, and later reproduced on every Cabbage Patch Kids product from 1983 onward:\n\n<blockquote>Xavier Roberts was a ten-year-old boy who discovered the Cabbage Patch Kids by following a BunnyBee behind a waterfall into a magical Cabbage Patch, where he found the Cabbage Patch babies being born. To help them find good homes he built BabyLand General in Cleveland, Georgia where the Cabbage Patch Kids could live and play until they were adopted. BunnyBees are bee-like creatures with rabbit ears they use as wings. They pollinate cabbages with their magic crystals to make Cabbage Patch babies. Colonel Casey is a large stork who oversees Babyland General Hospital. He's the narrator of the Cabbage Patch Kids' story.  Otis Lee is the leader of the gang of Cabbage Patch Kids that befriended Xavier.</blockquote>\n\n===Coleco years===\nThe name change to Cabbage Patch Kids was made in 1982 when Xavier's company, Original Appalachian Artworks, began to license a smaller version of the handmade creations to a toy manufacturer named [[Coleco]] which began mass production the same year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accessnorthga.com/detail.php?n=213040&c=10|title=Cleveland's Cabbage Patch Kids turn 25|publisher=AccessNorthGA.com|date=2008-09-07|accessdate=2010-08-07}}</ref> The Coleco Cabbage Patch Kids had large, round [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] heads (originally of a different, hard plastic), and soft fabric bodies, and were produced from 1982 to 1989, many at a factory in [[Amsterdam, New York]]. The first two years production was all from the Far East, with nine head variations produced and computer-matched with bodies to ensure each doll was \"different\". It was, in fact, a marketing ploy that worked quite well as a wide range of variations resulted. (Source: Larry Moniz, then senior account supervisor for the Coleco account at Richard Weiner Public Relations in NYC.)\n\nAt the peak of their popularity, the dolls were a must-have [[toy]] for [[Christmas]].<ref>{{cite news |title= Booming Sales in Toyland |work= Time|date=1984-12-10 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,955377,00.html|accessdate=2010-03-03 | first1=John S. | last1=DeMott | first2=Other | last2=Bureaus | first3=Rosemary | last3=Byrnes}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title= TOYS: Trouble in the Cabbage Patch|work=Time|date=1988-05-16 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,967387,00.html |accessdate=2010-03-03}}</ref> Parents across the [[United States]] flocked to stores to try to obtain one of the Cabbage Patch Kids for their children, with fights occasionally erupting between parents over the hard-to-find dolls. In later years, Coleco introduced variants on the original Cabbage Patch Kids, and derivatives of the original line of dolls continued to be marketed.\n\n===International variations===\nIn the 1980s when [[Coleco]] was producing the dolls for the North American market, the global craze was fulfilled by other companies:\n* Jesmar Toy Company made the dolls for the European Market, including Spain, Italy, and West Germany.\n* Lili Ledy Toy Company made the dolls for Mexico and South America.\n* Triang-Pedigree Toy Company made the dolls for South Africa.\n* Tsukuda Toy Company manufactured the dolls for Japan and Asia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mycpkcollection.weebly.com/cpk-info.html |title=Collector information, identification - My Cabbage Patch Kids |publisher=Mycpkcollection.weebly.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-19}}</ref>\nThe Dolls manufactured by each of these companies, and along with the factories that produced the dolls for North America, produced dolls that were slightly different from one another. Dolls that were made for consumers in other countries than the United States hold a higher value in the eye of some American collectors.\n\n===Hasbro years===\n[[Hasbro]] took over the rights to produce Cabbage Patch dolls in 1988 after Coleco filed for [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy,<ref name=coleco-chapter11>{{cite news|title= Cabbage Patch Doll Maker Is Bankrupt |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=1988-07-12|url= https://articles.latimes.com/1988-07-12/news/mn-5746_1_cabbage-patch-kids|accessdate=2013-11-12}}</ref> and continued to make the dolls with various gimmicks, including dolls that played [[kazoo]]s. Some of the more popular doll lines to come out under the Cabbage Patch Kids name included the \"Birthday Kids\", \"Splash 'n' Tan Kids\", and \"Pretty Crimp and Curl\". Hasbro gradually began making the dolls for younger children, which led to smaller and smaller dolls.  Although Cabbage Patch dolls were still best selling toys, Hasbro never really revitalized the Cabbage Patch market. In 1994, [[Mattel]] acquired the licensing rights to the dolls from Original Appalachian Artworks.\n{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n===Mattel years===\nIn 1994, Mattel took over the Cabbage Patch [[brand]], including production. The first Mattel Cabbage Patch dolls hit the stores in 1995.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nThe Mattel Cabbage Patch dolls are not limited to cloth bodies and included dolls made from [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]], which produced a more durable play doll. The Mattel dolls are mostly sized 14\" or smaller, and most variants were individualized with a [[gimmick]] to enhance their collectibility, e.g. some dolls played on water-toys, swam, ate food, or brushed their teeth.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nSome memorable Mattel lines include the updated Kids line of basic cloth dolls that came with [[birth certificates]], the OlympiKids that were made to coincide with the [[1996 Olympics]], and the Cabbage Patch [[Flower|Fairies]]. Additionally, to celebrate the dolls' 15th anniversary, Mattel created a line of exclusively female dolls with a new molded fabric face, dressed in a custom outfits and packaged in collectible boxes. These were 16 inches tall, the same measurement of the first Coleco Cabbage Patch Kids.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n===Toys \"R\" Us Kids===\nIn 2001, retailer [[Toys \"R\" Us]] took over the Cabbage Patch brand from Mattel, producing 20-inch Kids and 18-inch babies, both with cloth bodies and vinyl heads. They were packaged in cardboard [[cabbage leaf]] seats. In 2001, the 20-inch dolls debuted in the [[Times Square]] flagship store. These were created to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the line, and were available both [[online]] and in stores around the US.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n===Play Along Toys===\nThe Toys \"R\" Us line lasted until [[Play Along]] toys obtained exclusive licensing rights to produce the Cabbage Patch Kids doll line. In 2003, Play Along launched a Cabbage Patch Kids 25th Anniversary collection using some of the original head sculpts from the very first Coleco editions. Play Along also partnered with [[Carvel Ice Cream]] in a co-branding campaign.  The resulting co-branded Cabbage Patch Kids were packaged with a Carvel-branded ice cream cone.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n===Jakks Pacific===\nJAKKS Pacific acquired Play Along Toys and assumed the master toy licensee (c2011) for the Cabbage Patch Kids.  Jakks introduced a 14-inch Cabbage Patch Kids Fashionality(TM) line and other Cabbage Patch Kid products. In 2013 Jakks Pacific released the Celebration edition to commemorate the 30th Birthday of the licensed Cabbage Patch Kids. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n===Wicked Cool Toys===\nWicked Cool Toys is now the current master toy licensee for the Cabbage Patch Kids.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kidscreen.com/2015/02/10/wicked-cool-toys-adopts-cabbage-patch-kids/ |title=Archive \u00bb Wicked Cool Toys adopts Cabbage Patch Kids |publisher=Kidscreen |date=2015-02-10 |accessdate=2016-03-19}}</ref>\n\nIn this line, WCT released new additions like Little Sprouts, a toyline of tiny collectable dolls, and Adoptimals, plush pets who interact with the Kids.\n\n==Cabbage Patch Kids brand==\nThe original 1982 Cabbage Patch Kids [[license agreement]] with Coleco Industries was negotiated by Roger L. Schlaifer on behalf of Schlaifer Nance & Company, the exclusive worldwide licensing agent for Roberts' company at the time.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nFollowing Schlaifer Nance & Company's signing of Coleco Industries, SN&C signed over one hundred and fifty licenses for branded products ranging from the first children's licensed character [[diapers]] and low-sugar cereal to clothing, backyard pools, and thousands of other children's products \u2013 generating over $2 billion in retail sales for 1984, alone. Total sales during the Schlaifers' tenure exceeded $4.5 billion. While sales of the dolls and other licensed products declined precipitously in the late 1980s, the dolls have become a mainstay of the toy industry, and one of the few long-running doll brands in history.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=abYKXvCwEToC&pg=PA84&lpg=PA84&dq=cabbage+patch+kids+4.5+billion&source=bl&ots=jGzcuD2oLr&sig=PJB4oxSbSdj84zxeN7tHOt6suHo&hl=lv&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj8wP7LkOzOAhVnMJoKHXPqA5oQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&q=cabbage%20patch%20kids%204.5%20billion&f=false|title=Harry Potter: The Story of a Global Business Phenomenon|publisher=Susan Gunelius|accessdate=August 31, 2016|isbn=978-0-230-59410-4}}</ref>\n\n==Porcelain Cabbage Patch Kids==\nThese dolls were available by [[direct mail]] from the [[Danbury Mint]]. They have a rigid fabric body with [[porcelain]] legs, arms, and head.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n==Talking Cabbage Patch Kids==\nAn extension to the line was the \"Talking Cabbage Patch Kid\" introduced by Coleco, equipped with a voice chip, touch sensors, a microphone, short range 49&nbsp;MHz AM transmitter and receiver for communicating with other such dolls. Touch sensors in the hands enabled the toy to detect when and how it was being played with in response to its vocalizations. For example, the doll might say \"hold my hand\" and give an appropriate speech response when the touch sensor in either hand detected pressure. It also had a movement detector to show the positioning of the doll and whether it was sensed to be on its belly, back, or even upside down. A special plastic 'drinking' cup containing a hidden magnet, which could be identified with the aid a small reed relay in the built into the head of the toy above the mouth, to signify when it should be seen to be 'drinking'. A more remarkable effect occurred when one doll detected the presence of another through its 49&nbsp;MHz AM transmitter/receiver. The dolls were programmed to signal their \"awareness\" of each other with a short phrase, e.g. \"I think there's someone else to play with here!\", and then to initiate simple conversations ''between the dolls themselves'' with enough randomness to sound somewhat natural. The joint synchronised singing of 'rounds' being particularly impressive. The inclusion of the microphone was to delay the search and communication with another of its type when the ambient noise was above a certain level.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n==Babyland General Hospital==\n[[Babyland General Hospital]] is the \"birthplace\" of Cabbage Patch Kids and is located in [[Cleveland, Georgia]]. Roberts converted an old clinic into a \"hospital\" from which to sell his dolls, originally called \"Little People\". The facility is presented as a [[birth]]ing, [[Nursery (room)|nursery]], and [[adoption]] center for the Cabbage Patch Kids. In accordance with the theme, employees dress and act the parts of the doctors and nurses caring for the dolls as if they are real. Babyland General moved to a new facility on the outskirts of Cleveland, Georgia in 2010 and has been voted one of the Travel Channel's top 10 toylands.\n\n==Controversies==\n{{See also|Cabbage Patch riots}}\n\n=== Lawsuits ===\nThough Xavier Roberts was the creator of the Cabbage Patch Kids brand, many of the brand's defining characteristics \u2013 such as the dolls' overly round faces and that they came with an [[adoption]] certificate \u2013 were taken from [[Martha Nelson Thomas]], an American folk artist from [[Kentucky]]. Before Roberts became involved in the toy industry, Thomas had created and marketed her own line of dolls, called Doll Babies, which she sold at local arts and craft shows and markets. The two crossed paths at a state fair in 1976, whereupon Roberts began purchasing Thomas' dolls to sell at a profit at his own store in Georgia.<ref>\"The Secret History of Cabbage Patch Dolls\" May 10, 2015 Vice.https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8gk4dk/the-secret-history-of-cabbage-patch-kids-011</ref><ref>Piro, Lauren.\"The Not-So-Sweet Truth About Cabbage Patch Kids: Behind those iconic chubby cheeks is a disappointing story\" Apr 21, 2015.

The Nath [[Sampradaya]] is considered as a development of the earlier [[Siddha]] or [[Avadhuta]] Sampradaya,<ref name=Despande>Deshpande, M.N. (1986). ''The Caves of Panhale-Kaji''.

Hatha yoga is a holistic path of yoga which includes disciplines, postures (asana), purification procedures (shatkriya), gestures (mudra), breathing (pranayama), meditation (dhyana), samadhi.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe Nath tradition is a syncretic [[Yoga]] and [[Vedanta]] schools of [[Hindu philosophy]] based Shaiva tradition, that reveres Shiva and [[Dattatreya]].
