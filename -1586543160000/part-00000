Between the 16th and 17th centuries noted Venetian families (including the [[Contarini]] and the [[Venier]]s) built a number of villas in the area, and at this same time the old center, V\u00f2 Vecchio, was founded, seat of the ''comune'' until 1900. In 1900 a new municipal \"capital\" was set up at V\u00f2 Centro, known also as Ca' Erizzo; in 1933 the name V\u00f2 was made definitive. As for orthography, the name is properly written with a grave accent, although it is sometimes erroneously spelled with an apostrophe (Vo'). One of its most famous villas is the Ca' Morosini.

These services are also operated by Northern, using a mixture of Class [[British Rail Class 321|321]], [[British Rail Class 322|322]] and [[British Rail Class 333|333]] Electric Multiple Units. Northern also operate services from Leeds to Lancaster, Morecambe and Heysham Port, as well as services to Carlisle (on the Settle\u2013Carlisle line), all of which serve Skipton.

A branch from Earby to Barnoldswick was opened in 1871.\n\nThe Skipton\u2013Colne line was not listed for closure as part of Dr Beeching's 1963 \"The Reshaping of British Railway's\" report, however the line closed in February 1970 (with the Barnoldswick branch having earlier closed in September 1965).\n\n== Skipton\u2013Colne and the East Lancashire line ==\n[[File:Skipton Colne Rail Missing Link Map SELRAP.jpg|700px|thumb|\"The Missing Link\" - the 11.5 mile missing line between Skipton and Colne, also showing other railway lines in the area.]]\nThe missing section of railway between Skipton and Colne is {{convert|11.5|mi}} in length.<ref name=\"RM\">{{cite magazine |last1=Broadbent |first1=Steve |title=SELRAP's five-year reopening dream |magazine=Rail Magazine |date=23 May 2018 |issue=853 |page=42 |publisher=Bauer Media |location=Peterborough |issn=0953-4563}}</ref>\n\nThe remaining [[East Lancashire line]] serves a conurbation of some half a million people.

The route is affected by numerous permanent speed restrictions, particularly at junctions. The service is currently operated by [[Northern (train operating company)|Northern]], with services operating using [[British Rail Class 142|Class 142]] or [[British Rail Class 150|Class 150]] Diesel Multiple Units.\n\nSkipton is on the [[Airedale line]] and is served by frequent electric trains which serve Leeds every 30 minutes, with a journey time of around 40 minutes, and Bradford Forster Square every 30 minutes, with a journey time of around 35 minutes. These services are also operated by Northern, using a mixture of Class [[British Rail Class 321|321]], [[British Rail Class 322|322]] and [[British Rail Class 333|333]] Electric Multiple Units. Northern also operate services from Leeds to Lancaster, Morecambe and Heysham Port, as well as services to Carlisle (on the Settle\u2013Carlisle line), all of which serve Skipton. Skipton also has a direct return service to London Kings Cross operated by [[London North Eastern Railway]] (06.55 from Skipton, 18.03 from London).\n\n== Reinstatement proposal ==\nReinstatement of Colne\u2013Skipton would provide scope for both local and regional rail services. SELRAP say the line will deliver a number of benefits to local communities, the Northwest and the UK as a whole. SELRAP's proposals include opening at least one station between Skipton and Colne. The number and precise location(s) will depend on the viability study required. Whilst SELRAP are in favour of only one intermediate station (West Craven Parkway) in the interim, the [[Campaign for Better Transport (United Kingdom)|Campaign for Better Transport]] are also wanting to see {{rws|Earby}} railway station re-opened too.<ref>{{cite web |title=Re-opening rail lines |url=https://bettertransport.org.uk/re-opening-rail-lines |website=bettertransport.org.uk |accessdate=2 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Haigh |first1=Phillip |title=Rail reopenings: where is the money coming from? |magazine=Rail Magazine |date=27 February 2019 |issue=873 |page=34 |publisher=Bauer Media |location=Peterborough |issn=0953-4563}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Pickering |first1=Graeme |title=Re-building a missing cross-Pennine link |magazine=The Railway Magazine |date=June 2018 |volume=164 |issue=1,407 |pages=52&ndash;53 |publisher=Mortons Media |location=Horncastle |issn=0033-8923}}</ref>\n\nA 2003 study commissioned by Lancashire and North Yorkshire County Councils from consultants Steer Davies Gleave found that the formation was largely intact and there were no insurmountable obstacles to reinstatement of the line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lancashire2016.com/pdf/skipton_colne_railway_report.pdf|title=Skipton\u2013Colne Railway Report|accessdate=3 February 2018|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227065617/http://www.lancashire2016.com/pdf/skipton_colne_railway_report.pdf|archivedate=27 February 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 2007 SELRAP commissioned a study by JMP Consultants to further assess the business case.

The name derives from \"rocky land\", as the area has been aptly described.\n\nRockland County is the smallest county by area in New York State outside [[New York City]]. It comprises five towns and nineteen incorporated villages, with numerous unincorporated villages (sixteen) and [[Hamlet (New York)|hamlets]]. Rockland County is designated as a [[List of Preserve America Communities|Preserve America Community]], and nearly a third of the county's area is parkland. The county has the largest [[American Jews|Jewish]] population per capita of any U.S. county, with 31.4%, or 90,000 residents, being Jewish.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rockland County|url=https://www.ny.gov/counties/rockland|website=New York State|accessdate=4 January 2019}}</ref> Rockland also ranked 31st on the list of highest-income counties by median [[household income in the United States]], with a median household income of $82,534 according to the 2010 census.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Rockland County, New York (1798\u20131900)}}\n[[File:Half Moon in Hudson.jpg|thumb|[[Henry Hudson]]'s ''Halve Maen'' (''Half Moon'') on the Hudson River]]\n[[File:SouthNyackNY CarsonMcCullersHouse.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Carson McCullers House]] in South Nyack]]\n[[File:DeWint House Tappan.JPG|thumb|[[DeWint House]] (circa 1700) is the oldest home in Rockland County.]]\n[[File:RocklandCountyCourthouse.jpg|thumb|Historic [[Rockland County Courthouse and Dutch Gardens|Rockland County Courthouse]] in New City]]\n\nThe area that would become Rockland County was originally inhabited by [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking Aboriginals, including [[Munsee]]s, or [[Lenni Lenape]].\n\nIn 1609, [[Henry Hudson]], thinking he had found the legendary \"[[Northwest Passage]]\", sailed on the ''Half Moon'' up the river that would one day bear his name and anchored near the area that is now [[Haverstraw, New York|Haverstraw]] before continuing to disillusionment north of [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] were the first Europeans to settle in the area, around 1675.<ref name=NY>{{cite web|url=http://www.co.rockland.ny.us/Arts/history.htm|title=County of Rockland, New York :: Home |publisher=Co.rockland.ny.us|accessdate=3 February 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311104721/http://www.co.rockland.ny.us/Arts/history.htm|archivedate=March 11, 2012}}</ref> These settlers, eager to escape \"city life\", moved from Manhattan to Rockland.  A number of unique Dutch-style red sandstone houses still stand, and many place names in the county reveal their Dutch origin. When the [[Duke of York]] (who became King [[James II of England]]) established the first twelve counties of New York in 1683, present-day Rockland County was part of [[Orange County, New York|Orange County]], known then as ''\"Orange County South of the Mountains\"''. [[Orangetown, New York|Orangetown]] was created at the same time under a royal grant, originally encompassing all of modern Rockland County. Around this time, as the English began to colonize [[Nyack, New York|Nyack]] and [[Tappan, New York|Tappan]], the Native Americans began to leave Rockland in search of undisturbed land further north.<ref name=NY/>\n\nThe natural barrier of the [[Ramapo Mountains]] and the size of the county made it difficult to carry out governmental activities. At one point there were twin governments, one on each side of the Ramapo Mountains. For this reason, Rockland split off from Orange in 1798 to form its own county. That same year the county seat was transferred from Tappan to New City, where a new courthouse was built.\n\nHaverstraw was separated from Orangetown in 1719 and became a town in 1788; it included the present-day [[Clarkstown, New York|Clarkstown]], [[Ramapo, New York|Ramapo]] and [[Stony Point, New York|Stony Point]]. Clarkstown and Ramapo became towns in 1791, followed by Stony Point in 1865.\n[[File:Lenapehoking.png|thumb|upright|The territory of the Lenape in present-day southern New York, New Jersey and eastern sections of Delaware and Pennsylvania]]\n\nDuring the [[American Revolution]], when control of the [[Hudson River]] was viewed by the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] as strategic to dominating the American territories, Rockland saw [[battle|skirmishes]] at Haverstraw, Nyack and [[Piermont, New York|Piermont]], and significant military engagements at the [[Battle of Stony Point]], where General \"Mad\" [[Anthony Wayne]] earned his nickname. [[George Washington]] had headquarters for a time at John Suffern's tavern, the later site of the village of [[Suffern, New York|Suffern]]. British Major [[John Andr\u00e9]] met with American traitor [[Benedict Arnold]] near Stony Point to buy the plans for the [[fortification]]s at [[West Point, New York|West Point]]. Andr\u00e9 was captured with the plans in [[Tarrytown, New York|Tarrytown]] on his way back to the British lines; he was brought to Tappan for trial in the Tappan church, found guilty, hanged and buried nearby. Still another important chapter in the story of the Revolution was written on May 5, 1783, when General Washington received [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|Sir Guy Carleton]] at the [[DeWint House]], where they discussed terms of a peace treaty. Two days later Washington visited Sir Guy aboard a British war vessel. On this day the King's Navy fired its first salute to the flag of the United States of America.\n\nIn the decades following the Revolution, Rockland became popular for its stone and bricks. These products, however, required quarrying in land that many later believed should be set aside as a preserve. Many unsuccessful efforts were made to turn much of the [[Hudson Highlands]] on the northern tip of the county into a forest preserve. However, [[Union Pacific Railroad]] president [[E. H. Harriman]] donated land as well as large sums of money for the purchase of properties in the area of [[Bear Mountain (Hudson Highlands)|Bear Mountain]]. [[Bear Mountain State Park|Bear Mountain]]/[[Harriman State Park (New York)|Harriman State Park]] became a reality in 1910 when Harriman's widow donated his lands to the state, and by 1914 it was estimated that more than a million people a year were coming to the park.

The Supreme Court is the trial level court of the [[New York State Unified Court System]], which presents some confusion as the Supreme Court is the highest [[Appellate court|court of appeals]] in the federal system as well as in most states (the Court of Appeals is the highest court in New York State). The Supreme Court has broad authority over all categories of cases, both civil and criminal. Generally the Supreme Court in Rockland County hears [[Civil law (common law)|civil cases]] involving claims in excess of $25,000. While the Supreme Court has jurisdiction over [[Criminal law|criminal cases]] in most counties this is handled by the County Courts. In Rockland however, the Supreme Court does exercise jurisdiction over some criminal cases.\n\nThe County Court is inferior to the Supreme Court and is authorized to hear criminal cases that have occurred in the county as well as limited jurisdiction over civil cases. The County Court handles [[felony]] cases exclusively and shares jurisdiction with the town and village justice courts on [[misdemeanor]] cases and other minor offenses and violations. The County Court's jurisdiction on civil cases is limited to those involving less than $25,000.\n\nEach of the towns and fifteen of the villages have [[Justice Courts]], which mostly hear routine [[traffic ticket]] cases, especially from the [[New York State Thruway]] and the [[Palisades Interstate Parkway]]. They also handle [[drunk driving]] charges, lower-level criminal [[misdemeanor]] matters, and occasionally perform [[arraignment]] on [[felonies]] (most felony proceedings are heard in County Court). These courts generally handle the highest volume of cases.\n\n===National politics===\nLike most of the Hudson Valley, Rockland County historically voted Republican. Between 1892 and 1992, Rockland County only voted Democratic three times\u2013[[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s landslide victory of [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]], [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s landslide victory in [[1936 United States presidential election|1936]] (in which it was the only New York City suburb to vote Democratic), and [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s first campaign in [[1912 United States presidential election|1912]]. Rockland shifted Democratic in 1992, and has since only voted Republican once, in [[United States presidential election|2004]] for [[George W. Bush]]. Despite this shift, national elections have remained close in Rockland County as compared to neighboring [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], which has witnessed dependable double-digit Democratic victories since the 1990s.\n{{Hidden begin|titlestyle=background:#ccccff|title=Presidential election results}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential election results'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Atlas of US Presidential Elections|last=Leip|first=David|website=uselectionatlas.org|access-date=24 October 2018}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

The Clarkstown solar field project is at the maximum size that is currently allowed by New York State.

It comprises five towns and nineteen incorporated villages, with numerous unincorporated villages (sixteen) and [[Hamlet (New York)|hamlets]]. Rockland County is designated as a [[List of Preserve America Communities|Preserve America Community]], and nearly a third of the county's area is parkland.

The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] were the first Europeans to settle in the area, around 1675.<ref name=NY>{{cite web|url=http://www.co.rockland.ny.us/Arts/history.htm|title=County of Rockland, New York :: Home |publisher=Co.rockland.ny.us|accessdate=3 February 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311104721/http://www.co.rockland.ny.us/Arts/history.htm|archivedate=March 11, 2012}}</ref> These settlers, eager to escape \"city life\", moved from Manhattan to Rockland.  A number of unique Dutch-style red sandstone houses still stand, and many place names in the county reveal their Dutch origin. When the [[Duke of York]] (who became King [[James II of England]]) established the first twelve counties of New York in 1683, present-day Rockland County was part of [[Orange County, New York|Orange County]], known then as ''\"Orange County South of the Mountains\"''. [[Orangetown, New York|Orangetown]] was created at the same time under a royal grant, originally encompassing all of modern Rockland County. Around this time, as the English began to colonize [[Nyack, New York|Nyack]] and [[Tappan, New York|Tappan]], the Native Americans began to leave Rockland in search of undisturbed land further north.<ref name=NY/>\n\nThe natural barrier of the [[Ramapo Mountains]] and the size of the county made it difficult to carry out governmental activities. At one point there were twin governments, one on each side of the Ramapo Mountains. For this reason, Rockland split off from Orange in 1798 to form its own county. That same year the county seat was transferred from Tappan to New City, where a new courthouse was built.\n\nHaverstraw was separated from Orangetown in 1719 and became a town in 1788; it included the present-day [[Clarkstown, New York|Clarkstown]], [[Ramapo, New York|Ramapo]] and [[Stony Point, New York|Stony Point]]. Clarkstown and Ramapo became towns in 1791, followed by Stony Point in 1865.\n[[File:Lenapehoking.png|thumb|upright|The territory of the Lenape in present-day southern New York, New Jersey and eastern sections of Delaware and Pennsylvania]]\n\nDuring the [[American Revolution]], when control of the [[Hudson River]] was viewed by the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] as strategic to dominating the American territories, Rockland saw [[battle|skirmishes]] at Haverstraw, Nyack and [[Piermont, New York|Piermont]], and significant military engagements at the [[Battle of Stony Point]], where General \"Mad\" [[Anthony Wayne]] earned his nickname. [[George Washington]] had headquarters for a time at John Suffern's tavern, the later site of the village of [[Suffern, New York|Suffern]]. British Major [[John Andr\u00e9]] met with American traitor [[Benedict Arnold]] near Stony Point to buy the plans for the [[fortification]]s at [[West Point, New York|West Point]]. Andr\u00e9 was captured with the plans in [[Tarrytown, New York|Tarrytown]] on his way back to the British lines; he was brought to Tappan for trial in the Tappan church, found guilty, hanged and buried nearby. Still another important chapter in the story of the Revolution was written on May 5, 1783, when General Washington received [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|Sir Guy Carleton]] at the [[DeWint House]], where they discussed terms of a peace treaty. Two days later Washington visited Sir Guy aboard a British war vessel. On this day the King's Navy fired its first salute to the flag of the United States of America.\n\nIn the decades following the Revolution, Rockland became popular for its stone and bricks. These products, however, required quarrying in land that many later believed should be set aside as a preserve. Many unsuccessful efforts were made to turn much of the [[Hudson Highlands]] on the northern tip of the county into a forest preserve. However, [[Union Pacific Railroad]] president [[E. H. Harriman]] donated land as well as large sums of money for the purchase of properties in the area of [[Bear Mountain (Hudson Highlands)|Bear Mountain]]. [[Bear Mountain State Park|Bear Mountain]]/[[Harriman State Park (New York)|Harriman State Park]] became a reality in 1910 when Harriman's widow donated his lands to the state, and by 1914 it was estimated that more than a million people a year were coming to the park.  After [[World War I]], Rockland county became the most important sausage making hub in the state of [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref>[https://italianfoodctr.com/ Italian Food Center (accessed 18 July 2019)]</ref><ref>[https://patch.com/new-york/pearlriver/italian-fest-returns-blauvelt Italian Fest Returns to Blauvelt (accessed 18 July 2019)]</ref><ref>[http://www.hvmag.com/Hudson-Valley-Magazine/Calendar/index.php/name/9th-Annual-Blauvelt-Sons-of-Italy-Italian-Feast-Carnival/event/26440/ 9th Annual Blauvelt Sons of Italy Festival (accessed 18 July 2019)]</ref>\n\nRockland remained semi-rural until the 1950s when the [[Palisades Interstate Parkway]], [[Tappan Zee Bridge (1955\u20132017)|Tappan Zee Bridge]], and other major arteries were built. The idea of [[suburbia]] also helped transform the county.

The Supreme Court is the trial level court of the [[New York State Unified Court System]], which presents some confusion as the Supreme Court is the highest [[Appellate court|court of appeals]] in the federal system as well as in most states (the Court of Appeals is the highest court in New York State). The Supreme Court has broad authority over all categories of cases, both civil and criminal. Generally the Supreme Court in Rockland County hears [[Civil law (common law)|civil cases]] involving claims in excess of $25,000. While the Supreme Court has jurisdiction over [[Criminal law|criminal cases]] in most counties this is handled by the County Courts. In Rockland however, the Supreme Court does exercise jurisdiction over some criminal cases.\n\nThe County Court is inferior to the Supreme Court and is authorized to hear criminal cases that have occurred in the county as well as limited jurisdiction over civil cases. The County Court handles [[felony]] cases exclusively and shares jurisdiction with the town and village justice courts on [[misdemeanor]] cases and other minor offenses and violations. The County Court's jurisdiction on civil cases is limited to those involving less than $25,000.\n\nEach of the towns and fifteen of the villages have [[Justice Courts]], which mostly hear routine [[traffic ticket]] cases, especially from the [[New York State Thruway]] and the [[Palisades Interstate Parkway]]. They also handle [[drunk driving]] charges, lower-level criminal [[misdemeanor]] matters, and occasionally perform [[arraignment]] on [[felonies]] (most felony proceedings are heard in County Court). These courts generally handle the highest volume of cases.\n\n===National politics===\nLike most of the Hudson Valley, Rockland County historically voted Republican. Between 1892 and 1992, Rockland County only voted Democratic three times\u2013[[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s landslide victory of [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]], [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s landslide victory in [[1936 United States presidential election|1936]] (in which it was the only New York City suburb to vote Democratic), and [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s first campaign in [[1912 United States presidential election|1912]]. Rockland shifted Democratic in 1992, and has since only voted Republican once, in [[United States presidential election|2004]] for [[George W. Bush]]. Despite this shift, national elections have remained close in Rockland County as compared to neighboring [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], which has witnessed dependable double-digit Democratic victories since the 1990s.\n{{Hidden begin|titlestyle=background:#ccccff|title=Presidential election results}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential election results'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Atlas of US Presidential Elections|last=Leip|first=David|website=uselectionatlas.org|access-date=24 October 2018}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

This period saw the increasing professionalisation and organisation of art in Scotland. Major institutions founded in this period included the Institution for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts in Scotland, the [[Royal Scottish Academy|Royal Scottish Academy of Art]], the [[National Gallery of Scotland]], the [[Scottish National Portrait Gallery]] and the [[Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts|Glasgow Institute]]. Art education in Edinburgh focused on the [[Trustees Drawing Academy of Edinburgh]]. [[Glasgow School of Art]] was founded in 1845 and [[Grays School of Art]] in Aberdeen in 1885.\n\n[[Henry Raeburn]], most famous for his intimate portraits of leading figures in Scottish life, was the first significant artist to pursue his entire career in Scotland. His pupils included the brothers William, Archibald and Andrew Robertson. The next generation of portrait painters included David Watson and [[John Watson Gordon]]. Significant Glasgow artists included [[John Graham-Gilbert]] and [[Daniel Macnee]]. [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]] emerged as of one of the most influential British artists of the century in a variety of forms. [[Alexander Nasmyth]] helped formulate the tradition of Scottish landscape painting, which focused in the mid-nineteenth century on the Highlands. It was taken into the late nineteenth century by artists including [[Horatio McCulloch]], [[Joseph Farquharson]] and [[William McTaggart]]. Towards the end of the century a number of artist colonies were founded, particularly in coastal communities such as [[Pittenweem]] and [[Kirkudbright]]. Wilkie was instrumental in the development of [[genre painting]], which was pursued by artists including [[John Burnet (painter)|John Burnet]], [[Alexander George Fraser]] and [[Walter Geikie]]. He also helped inspire the interest in Spanish and oriental painting, continued by [[William Allan (painter)|William Allan]], [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]] and [[John Phillip]].\n\nSculpture was pioneered in Scotland by [[Lawrence Macdonald]] and [[George Combe]]. [[John Steell]] was the first significant Scottish sculptor to pursue their career in Scotland, gaining attention for his ''Alexander and Bucephasus'' and his design for a statue of Sir Walter Scott incorporated into the author's memorial in Edinburgh. The tradition of Scottish sculpture was boosted by the statues made for the [[Wallace Monument]] and by the centenary of [[Robert Burns]]' death in 1896. Photography was pioneered in Scotland by [[Robert Adamson (photographer)|Robert Adamson]] and [[David Octavius Hill]]. As [[Hill & Adamson]] they formed the first photographic studio in Scotland in 1843 and produced work that is among the first and finest artistic uses of photography. It was subsequently pursued by [[Thomas Annan]], [[George Washington Wilson]] and [[Clementina Hawarden]].\n\nThe beginnings of the [[Arts and Crafts]] movement in Scotland were in the stained glass revival of the 1850s, pioneered in Edinburgh by [[James Ballantine]] and in Glasgow by [[Daniel Cottier]]. The Glasgow-born designer and theorist [[Christopher Dresser]] was one of the first, and most important, independent designers, a pivotal figure in the [[Aesthetic Movement]] and a major contributor to the allied [[Anglo-Japanese]] movement. A [[Celtic Revival]], drawing on ancient myths and history to produce art in a modern idiom, was pursued by artists including [[Anna Traquair]], [[John Duncan (painter)|John Duncan]], Stewart Carmichael and George Dutch Davidson. In the late nineteenth century developments in Scottish art are associated with the Glasgow School. This was made up of loose groups including the [[Glasgow Boys]], of [[James Guthrie (artist)|James Guthrie]], [[Joseph Crawhall III|Joseph Crawhall]], [[George Henry (painter)|George Henry]] and [[Edward Arthur Walton|E. A. Walton]], who were influenced by [[French Impressionism]] and [[Realism (art)|Realism]]. From around 1890 \"The Four\" or the \"Spook School\", was composed of acclaimed architect [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]], [[Margaret MacDonald (artist)|Margaret MacDonald]], [[Frances MacDonald|Frances]] and [[Herbert MacNair]]. They produced a distinctive blend of influences that helped define the [[Art Nouveau]] style.\n\n==Institutions and education==\n[[File:Wfm rsa building.jpg|thumb|The [[Royal Scottish Academy]], Edinburgh]]\nThe Institution for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts in Scotland was founded in 1819 in Edinburgh, to provide an opportunity for artists to present their work. It came to be dominated by a small aristocratic elite and excluded artists from its committee. This led to the founding of the [[Royal Scottish Academy|Royal Scottish Academy of Art]] in 1826. The resulting competition between the two bodies eventually resulted in a de facto merger. In 1835 the now Royal Institution's building on Princess Street, Edinburgh became the Academy's home for exhibitions.<ref name=MacDonald2000p90>M.

In the early decades of the century commissions continued to be given to English artists, including [[Samuel Joseph (sculptor)|Samuel Joseph]] (1791\u20131850), who was working in Edinburgh in 1821\u201329 and was a founding member of the Scottish Academy. Thomas Campbell (c. 1790\u20131858) studied in London and settled in Rome, where he received commissions from visiting British subjects before returning to London in 1830. His works in Scotland included the Hopetoun Memorial (1824\u201334) in Edinburgh. [[Lawrence Macdonald]] (1799\u20131878) was able to study at the Trustees Academy in Edinburgh and then Rome. He returned to Edinburgh from 1827, but moved back to Rome in 1832, where he worked for the rest of his life. His most significant works included his busts of [[Sir David Baird, 1st Baronet|General David Baird]] and of the [[phrenology|phrenologist]] [[George Combe]] (c. 1830).<ref>MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp.&nbsp;90\u20131.</ref>\n\nThe first significant Scottish sculptor to pursue their career in Scotland was [[John Steell]] (1804\u201391). He trained at the Trustee's Academy and in Rome and was elected to the Scottish Academy in 1830 while still in his twenties. His first work to gain significant public attention was his ''Alexander and Bucephasus''. His 1832 design for a statue of Sir Water Scott was incorporated into the author's memorial in Edinburgh. It marked the beginnings of a national school of sculpture based around major figures from Scottish culture and Scottish and British history. The tradition of Scottish sculpture was taken forward by artists such as [[Patric Park]] (1811\u201355), [[Alexander Handyside Ritchie]] (1804\u201370) and [[William Calder Marshall]] (1813\u201394). This reached fruition in the next generation of sculptors including [[William Brodie (sculptor)|William Brodie]] (1815\u201381), Amelia Hill (1820\u20131904) and Steell's apprentice David Watson Stevenson (1842\u20131904). Stevenson contributed the statue of [[William Wallace]] on the exterior of the [[Wallace Monument]] and many of the busts in the gallery of heroes inside, which included [[Robert the Bruce]], [[John Knox]], Walter Scott, [[Robert Burns]], [[James Watt]] and [[Thomas Carlyle]]. Public sculpture was boosted by the centenary of Burns' death in 1896. Stevenson produced a statue of the poet in Leith. Hill produced one for Dumfries. John Steell produced a statue for [[Central Park]] in New York, versions of which were made for Dundee, London and Dunedin.

[[David Scott (painter)|David Scott]]'s (1806\u201349) learnt the art of [[fresco]] painting from the Nazarenes. He painted historical works, such as ''The Poles did nobly and the Russian General Craved and Armistice to bury his Dead'' (1832) and ''Traitor's Gate'' (1842). His most ambitious historical work was the [[triptych]] ''Sir William Wallace, Scottish Wars: the Spear and English War: the Bow'' (1843). He also produced etchings for versions of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]]'s ''[[Ancient Mariner]]'', [[John Bunyan|Bunyan]]'s ''[[Pilgrim's Progress]]'' and [[J. P. Nichol]]'s ''Architecture of the Heavens'' (1850). Because of this early death he was known to, and admired by, the Pre-Raphaelites mainly through his brother [[William Bell Scott]] (1811\u201390), who became a close friend of founding member [[D. G.

This period saw the increasing professionalisation and organisation of art in Scotland. Major institutions founded in this period included the Institution for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts in Scotland, the [[Royal Scottish Academy|Royal Scottish Academy of Art]], the [[National Gallery of Scotland]], the [[Scottish National Portrait Gallery]] and the [[Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts|Glasgow Institute]]. Art education in Edinburgh focused on the [[Trustees Drawing Academy of Edinburgh]]. [[Glasgow School of Art]] was founded in 1845 and [[Grays School of Art]] in Aberdeen in 1885.\n\n[[Henry Raeburn]], most famous for his intimate portraits of leading figures in Scottish life, was the first significant artist to pursue his entire career in Scotland. His pupils included the brothers William, Archibald and Andrew Robertson. The next generation of portrait painters included David Watson and [[John Watson Gordon]]. Significant Glasgow artists included [[John Graham-Gilbert]] and [[Daniel Macnee]]. [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]] emerged as of one of the most influential British artists of the century in a variety of forms. [[Alexander Nasmyth]] helped formulate the tradition of Scottish landscape painting, which focused in the mid-nineteenth century on the Highlands. It was taken into the late nineteenth century by artists including [[Horatio McCulloch]], [[Joseph Farquharson]] and [[William McTaggart]]. Towards the end of the century a number of artist colonies were founded, particularly in coastal communities such as [[Pittenweem]] and [[Kirkudbright]]. Wilkie was instrumental in the development of [[genre painting]], which was pursued by artists including [[John Burnet (painter)|John Burnet]], [[Alexander George Fraser]] and [[Walter Geikie]]. He also helped inspire the interest in Spanish and oriental painting, continued by [[William Allan (painter)|William Allan]], [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]] and [[John Phillip]].\n\nSculpture was pioneered in Scotland by [[Lawrence Macdonald]] and [[George Combe]]. [[John Steell]] was the first significant Scottish sculptor to pursue their career in Scotland, gaining attention for his ''Alexander and Bucephasus'' and his design for a statue of Sir Walter Scott incorporated into the author's memorial in Edinburgh. The tradition of Scottish sculpture was boosted by the statues made for the [[Wallace Monument]] and by the centenary of [[Robert Burns]]' death in 1896. Photography was pioneered in Scotland by [[Robert Adamson (photographer)|Robert Adamson]] and [[David Octavius Hill]]. As [[Hill & Adamson]] they formed the first photographic studio in Scotland in 1843 and produced work that is among the first and finest artistic uses of photography. It was subsequently pursued by [[Thomas Annan]], [[George Washington Wilson]] and [[Clementina Hawarden]].\n\nThe beginnings of the [[Arts and Crafts]] movement in Scotland were in the stained glass revival of the 1850s, pioneered in Edinburgh by [[James Ballantine]] and in Glasgow by [[Daniel Cottier]]. The Glasgow-born designer and theorist [[Christopher Dresser]] was one of the first, and most important, independent designers, a pivotal figure in the [[Aesthetic Movement]] and a major contributor to the allied [[Anglo-Japanese]] movement. A [[Celtic Revival]], drawing on ancient myths and history to produce art in a modern idiom, was pursued by artists including [[Anna Traquair]], [[John Duncan (painter)|John Duncan]], Stewart Carmichael and George Dutch Davidson. In the late nineteenth century developments in Scottish art are associated with the Glasgow School. This was made up of loose groups including the [[Glasgow Boys]], of [[James Guthrie (artist)|James Guthrie]], [[Joseph Crawhall III|Joseph Crawhall]], [[George Henry (painter)|George Henry]] and [[Edward Arthur Walton|E. A. Walton]], who were influenced by [[French Impressionism]] and [[Realism (art)|Realism]]. From around 1890 \"The Four\" or the \"Spook School\", was composed of acclaimed architect [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]], [[Margaret MacDonald (artist)|Margaret MacDonald]], [[Frances MacDonald|Frances]] and [[Herbert MacNair]]. They produced a distinctive blend of influences that helped define the [[Art Nouveau]] style.\n\n==Institutions and education==\n[[File:Wfm rsa building.jpg|thumb|The [[Royal Scottish Academy]], Edinburgh]]\nThe Institution for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts in Scotland was founded in 1819 in Edinburgh, to provide an opportunity for artists to present their work. It came to be dominated by a small aristocratic elite and excluded artists from its committee. This led to the founding of the [[Royal Scottish Academy|Royal Scottish Academy of Art]] in 1826. The resulting competition between the two bodies eventually resulted in a de facto merger. In 1835 the now Royal Institution's building on Princess Street, Edinburgh became the Academy's home for exhibitions.<ref name=MacDonald2000p90>M.

He returned to Edinburgh from 1827, but moved back to Rome in 1832, where he worked for the rest of his life. His most significant works included his busts of [[Sir David Baird, 1st Baronet|General David Baird]] and of the [[phrenology|phrenologist]] [[George Combe]] (c. 1830).<ref>MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp.&nbsp;90\u20131.</ref>\n\nThe first significant Scottish sculptor to pursue their career in Scotland was [[John Steell]] (1804\u201391). He trained at the Trustee's Academy and in Rome and was elected to the Scottish Academy in 1830 while still in his twenties. His first work to gain significant public attention was his ''Alexander and Bucephasus''. His 1832 design for a statue of Sir Water Scott was incorporated into the author's memorial in Edinburgh. It marked the beginnings of a national school of sculpture based around major figures from Scottish culture and Scottish and British history. The tradition of Scottish sculpture was taken forward by artists such as [[Patric Park]] (1811\u201355), [[Alexander Handyside Ritchie]] (1804\u201370) and [[William Calder Marshall]] (1813\u201394). This reached fruition in the next generation of sculptors including [[William Brodie (sculptor)|William Brodie]] (1815\u201381), Amelia Hill (1820\u20131904) and Steell's apprentice David Watson Stevenson (1842\u20131904). Stevenson contributed the statue of [[William Wallace]] on the exterior of the [[Wallace Monument]] and many of the busts in the gallery of heroes inside, which included [[Robert the Bruce]], [[John Knox]], Walter Scott, [[Robert Burns]], [[James Watt]] and [[Thomas Carlyle]]. Public sculpture was boosted by the centenary of Burns' death in 1896. Stevenson produced a statue of the poet in Leith. Hill produced one for Dumfries. John Steell produced a statue for [[Central Park]] in New York, versions of which were made for Dundee, London and Dunedin. Statues of Burns and Scott were produced in areas of Scottish settlement, particularly in North America and Australia.<ref>MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp.&nbsp;125\u20137.</ref>\n\n==Photography==\n{{Main|Scottish photography}}\n[[File:His Faither\u2019s Breeks.jpg|left|thumb|upright|''His Faither's Breeks'', by [[Hill & Adamson]] (1843\u201347)]]\nAccording to photo historian David Burn \"there is a good case to be made for the proposition that the greatest contribution that Scotland has made to the visual arts, possibly to the arts as a whole, is in the art of photography\".<ref name=Burn2011>D.

They were also influenced by, and influenced, the work of the English Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, who rejected the formalism of [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] painting after [[Raphael]]. [[David Scott (painter)|David Scott]]'s (1806\u201349) learnt the art of [[fresco]] painting from the Nazarenes. He painted historical works, such as ''The Poles did nobly and the Russian General Craved and Armistice to bury his Dead'' (1832) and ''Traitor's Gate'' (1842). His most ambitious historical work was the [[triptych]] ''Sir William Wallace, Scottish Wars: the Spear and English War: the Bow'' (1843). He also produced etchings for versions of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]]'s ''[[Ancient Mariner]]'', [[John Bunyan|Bunyan]]'s ''[[Pilgrim's Progress]]'' and [[J. P. Nichol]]'s ''Architecture of the Heavens'' (1850). Because of this early death he was known to, and admired by, the Pre-Raphaelites mainly through his brother [[William Bell Scott]] (1811\u201390), who became a close friend of founding member [[D. G. Rossetti]]. His most famous work, ''Iron and Coal'' was one of the most popular Victorian images and one of the few to fulfill the Pre-Raphaelite ambition to depict the modern world.<ref>Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', pp.&nbsp;205\u20138.</ref>\n\n[[File:William Dyce 002.jpg|thumb|right|[[William Dyce]] ''[[Pegwell Bay, Kent \u2013 a Recollection of October 5th 1858]]'' (c. 1859\u201360)]]\nThe figure in Scottish art most associated with the Pre-Raphaelites was the Aberdeen-born [[William Dyce]] (1806\u201364). He met the Nazarenes while in Italy and his work moved towards their \"early Christian\" art, as can be seen in his ''Madonna and Child'' (1848). Dyce befriended the young Pre-Raphaelites in London and introduced their work to [[John Ruskin]].<ref>Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', p. 348.</ref> His later work was Pre-Raphaelite in its spirituality, as can be seen in his ''The Man of Sorrows'' and ''David in the Wilderness'' (both 1860). His ''Pegwell Bay: a Recollection of October 5th 1858'' has been described as \"the archetypal pre-Raphaelite landscape\".<ref>MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 100.</ref> [[Joseph Noel Paton]] (1821\u20131901) studied at the Royal Academy schools in London, where he became a friend of [[John Everett Millais]] and he subsequently followed him into Pre-Raphaelitism, producing pictures that stressed detail and melodrama such as ''The Bludie Tryst'' (1855). His later paintings, like those of Millais, have been criticised for descending into popular sentimentality.<ref name=\"Macmillan\">Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', p. 213.</ref> Also influenced by Millais was [[James Archer (artist)|James Archer]] (1823\u20131904) and whose work includes ''Summertime, Gloucestershire'' (1860)<ref name=\"Macmillan\" /> and who from 1861 began a series of [[Arthurian]]-based paintings including ''La Morte d'Arthur'' and ''Sir Lancelot and Queen Guinevere''.<ref>R.

His major works included the great west window of [[Dunfermline Abbey]] and the scheme for [[St. Giles Cathedral]], Edinburgh. In Glasgow it was pioneered by [[Daniel Cottier]] (1838\u201391), who had probably studied with Ballantine, and was directly influenced by [[William Morris]], [[Ford Madox Brown]] and [[John Ruskin]]. His key works included the ''Baptism of Christ'' in [[Paisley Abbey]] (c. 1880). Among his followers were Stephen Adam and his son of the same name.<ref>MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 151.</ref> The Glasgow-born designer and theorist [[Christopher Dresser]] (1834\u20131904) was one of the first, and most important, independent designers, a pivotal figure in the [[Aesthetic Movement]] and a major contributor to the allied [[Anglo-Japanese]] movement.  He produced carpets, ceramics, furniture, glass, graphics, metalwork, including silver and electroplate, including his angular teapot of 1879.<ref>H.

Geddes established an informal college of tenement flats for artists at [[Ramsay Garden]] on Castle Hill in Edinburgh in the 1890s. Among the figures involved with the movement were [[Anna Traquair]] (1852\u20131936), who was commissioned by the Union to paint murals in the Mortuary Chapel of the [[Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh|Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh]] (1885\u201386 and 1896\u201398) and also worked in metal, illumination, illustration, embroidery and book binding.<ref name=MacDonad2000p155-6>MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp.&nbsp;155\u20136.</ref>\n\nThe most significant exponent of the revival was Dundee-born [[John Duncan (painter)|John Duncan]] (1866\u20131945), who was also influenced by [[Italian Renaissance art]] and French [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]. Among his most influential works are his paintings of Celtic subjects ''Tristan and Iseult'' (1912) and ''St Bride'' (1913).

To help avoid this problem, the technique of [[Sports periodization|periodization]] is applied. Periodization in the context of fitness or strength training programs means scheduling for adequate recovery time between training sessions, and for variety over the course of a long-term program. Motivation can be maintained by avoiding the [[Boredom|monotony]] of repeating identical exercise routines.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal |last1=Hass |first1=Christopher J. |last2=Feigenbaum |first2=Matthew S. |last3=Franklin |first3=Barry A. |title=Prescription of Resistance Training for Healthy Populations |journal=Sports Medicine |volume=31 |issue=14 |pages=953\u201364 |year=2001 |pmid=11735680 |doi=10.2165/00007256-200131140-00001 }}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Lee |first1=Mi-Joung |last2=Kilbreath |first2=Sharon L. |last3=Singh |first3=Maria Fiatarone |last4=Zeman |first4=Brian |last5=Davis |first5=Glen M. |title=Effect of Progressive Resistance Training on Muscle Performance after Chronic Stroke |journal=Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=23\u201334 |year=2010 |pmid=20010133 |doi=10.1249/MSS.0b013e3181b07a31 }}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Vannucci |first1=Robert C. |last2=Brucklacher |first2=Robert M. |last3=Vannucci |first3=Susan J. |title=Intracellular calcium accumulation during the evolution of hypoxic\u2013ischemic brain damage in the immature rat |journal=Developmental Brain Research |volume=126 |issue=1 |pages=117\u201320 |year=2001 |pmid=11172893 |doi=10.1016/S0165-3806(00)00135-8 }}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Kraemer |first1=William J. |last2=Ratamess |first2=Nicholas A. |last3=French |first3=Duncan N. |title=Resistance training for health and performance |journal=Current Sports Medicine Reports |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=165\u201371 |year=2002 |pmid=12831709 |doi=10.1249/00149619-200206000-00007 }}\n\n[[Category:Physical exercise]]\n", "name_user": "Victoragsf", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eNotes:added a references header", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_overload"}
