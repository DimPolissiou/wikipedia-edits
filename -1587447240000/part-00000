He stood {{convert|6|ft|1|in|m}} tall and weighed {{convert|195|lb|kg}}. He was among the most dominant pitchers in baseball history,  and ranks in the all-time top 10 in several key pitching categories, including wins, shutouts, and ERA.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/ |title=MLB & Baseball Leaders & Records |work=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-25}}</ref>  In {{baseball year|1936}}, Mathewson was elected into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] as one of its [[1936 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|first five]] members.\n\nMathewson grew up in [[Factoryville, Pennsylvania]], and began playing semiprofessional baseball when he was 14 years old. He played in the minor leagues in 1899, recording a record of 21 wins and two losses. He pitched for the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] the next season, but was sent back to the minors. He eventually returned to the Giants, and went on to win 373 games in his career, a [[National League]] record. He led the Giants to victory in the [[1905 World Series]] by pitching three [[shutout#Baseball|shutouts]]. Mathewson never pitched on [[Sunday baseball games|Sundays]], owing to his Christian beliefs. Mathewson served in the [[United States Army]]'s [[Chemical Corps|Chemical Warfare Service]] in World War I, and was accidentally exposed to [[chemical weapon]]s during training. His respiratory system was weakened from the exposure, causing him to contract [[tuberculosis]], from which he died in [[Saranac Lake, New York]] in 1925.\n\n==Early life==\nMathewson was born in [[Factoryville, Pennsylvania]] and attended high school at [[Keystone College|Keystone Academy]].

Some historians speculate that the Giants got word that their star pitcher was risking his baseball career for the Stars and ordered him to stop, while others feel that the Stars' coach, [[Willis Richardson (American football)|Willis Richardson]], got rid of Mathewson because he felt that, since the fullback's [[Punt (gridiron football)|punting skills]] were hardly used, he could replace him with a local player, Shirley Ellis.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Dave Berry and the Philadelphia Story |journal=Coffin Corner |publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association |volume=2 |issue=Annual |year=1980 |pages=1\u20139 |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/02-An-053.pdf |first=Bob |last=Carroll |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127040523/http://profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/02-An-053.pdf |archive-date=November 27, 2010 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n===Career with the Giants===\n[[File:Mathewson in NY uniform.jpg|thumb|Mathewson in his New York Giants uniform]]\nDuring his 17-year career, Mathewson won 373 games and lost 188 for a .665 winning percentage. His career [[Earned run average|ERA]] of 2.13 and 79 career [[shutout#Baseball|shutouts]] are among the best all time for pitchers, and his 373 [[win (baseball)|wins]] are still number one in the National League, tied with [[Grover Cleveland Alexander]]. He employed a good fastball, outstanding control, and, especially a new pitch he termed the \"fadeaway\" (later known in baseball as the \"[[screwball]]\"), which he learned from teammate [[Dave Williams (1900s pitcher)|Dave Williams]] in 1898.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Neyer/James Guide to Pitchers|author=Bill James|author2=Rob Neyer|author-link=Bill James|author2-link=Rob Neyer|last-author-amp=yes|year=2004|page=296|title-link=The Neyer/James Guide to Pitchers}}</ref>\n\nThis reference is challenged by Ken Burns documentary ''[[Baseball (TV series)|Baseball]]'' in which it is stated that Mathewson learned his \"fadeaway\" from [[Rube Foster|Andrew \"Rube\" Foster]] when New York Giants manager [[John McGraw|John Joseph McGraw]] quietly hired Rube to show the Giants bullpen what he knew. Many baseball historians consider this story apocryphal.\n\nMathewson recorded 2,507 career [[strikeout]]s against only 848 [[base on balls|walks]]. He is famous for his 25 pitching duels with [[Mordecai Brown|Mordecai \"Three Finger\" Brown]], who won 13 of the duels against Mathewson's 11, with one no-decision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Christy_Mathewson_1878&page=chronology|title=''The Ballplayers: Christy Mathewson''|publisher=BaseballLibrary.com|date=September 4, 1916|access-date=2009-04-03|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414040144/http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Christy_Mathewson_1878&page=chronology|archive-date=April 14, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nMathewson was a very good-hitting pitcher in his major league career, posting a .215 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] (362-for-1687) with\n151 [[run (baseball)|runs]], seven [[home runs]], and 167 [[RBI]]. In 10 of his 17 years in the majors, he was in double figures in RBIs, with a season-high of 20 in 1903. He batted .281 (9-for-32) in 11 World Series games.\n\nFrom 1900 to 1904, Mathewson established himself as a premier pitcher. Posting low ERAs and winning nearly 100 games, Mathewson helped McGraw raise the Giants' place in the standings. Though no World Series was held in 1904, the Giants captured the pennant, prompting McGraw to proclaim them as the best team in the world.\n\nMathewson strove even harder in 1905. After switching to catcher, [[Roger Bresnahan]] had begun collaborating with Mathewson, whose advanced memory of hitter weaknesses paved the way for a historic season. Pinpoint control guided Mathewson's pitches to Bresnahan's glove. In 338 innings, Mathewson walked only 64 batters. He shut out opposing teams eight times, pitching entire games in brief 90-minute sessions. Besides winning 31 games, Mathewson allowed only 1.28 earned runs for every nine innings. His 206 strikeouts led the league, earning him the [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown|Triple Crown]].<ref name=\"RRBio\">{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=Ray|title=Matty : an American hero|year=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-509263-9}}</ref>\n\nMathewson's Giants won the [[1905 World Series]] over the [[Philadelphia Athletics]]. Mathewson was the starting pitcher in game one, and pitched a four-hit [[shutouts in baseball|shutout]] for the victory. Three days later, with the series tied 1\u20131, he pitched another four-hit shutout. Then, two days later in game five, he threw a six-hit shutout to clinch the series for the Giants. In a span of only six days, Mathewson had pitched three complete games without allowing a run, while giving up only 14 hits.\n\nIn the next year, Mathewson lost much of his edge, owing to an early-season diagnosis of [[diphtheria]]. McGraw pulled over 260 innings from him, but these were plagued with struggle. Though he maintained a 22-12 record, his 2.97 ERA was well above the league average of 2.62. His 1.271 WHIP, quite uncharacteristic of him, was due to an increased number of hits and walks.\n\n[[File:Christy Mathewson 1913.jpg|thumb|left|Mathewson with the New York Giants, around 1913]]\nBy 1908, Mathewson was back on top as the league's elite pitcher. Winning the most games of his career, 37, coupled with a 1.43 ERA and 259 strikeouts, he claimed a second Triple Crown. He also led the league in innings pitched and shutouts, and held hitters to an exceptionally low 0.827 WHIP. Unfortunately, the Giants were unable to take home the pennant due to what was ultimately known as [[Merkle's Boner]], an incident that cost the Giants a crucial game against the Chicago Cubs, who eventually defeated the Giants in the standings by one game.\n\nMathewson returned for an incredible 1909 season, posting better numbers than the previous year. He repeated a strong performance in 1910 and then again in 1911, when the Giants captured their first pennant since 1905. The Giants ultimately lost the [[1911 World Series]] to the Philadelphia Athletics, the same team they had defeated for the 1905 championship. Mathewson and [[Rube Marquard]] allowed two game-winning home runs to Hall of Famer [[Home Run Baker|Frank Baker]], earning him the nickname, \"Home Run\".<ref name=\"RRBio\" /> Mathewson, the team's \"star pitcher\", signed a three-year contract with the Giants in late 1910, for the upcoming 1911, 1912 and 1913 seasons, the first time he had signed a contract over a year in length. <ref> {{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Matty Signs up for Three Years |url=http://nyshistoricnewspapers.org/lccn/sn85054113/1910-11-15/ed-1/seq-7/ |work=The Ogdensburg Journal |location=Ogdensburg, NY |date=November 15, 1910 |access-date=October 16, 2019 }} </ref>\n\nIn 1912, Mathewson gave another stellar performance. Capturing the pennant, the Giants were fueled by the stolen-base game and a superior pitching staff capped by Rube Marquard, the \"11,000-dollar lemon\" who turned around to win 26 games, 19 of them consecutively. In the [[1912 World Series]], the Giants faced the Boston Red Sox, the 1904 American League pennant winners who were to face the Giants in the World Series that year had it not been cancelled. Though Mathewson threw three complete games and maintained an ERA below 1.00, numerous errors by the Giants, including a lazy popup dropped by Fred Snodgrass in game seven, cost them the championship.<ref>{{cite book|last=Vaccaro|first=Mike|title=First Fall Classic|url=https://archive.org/details/firstfallclassic00mike|url-access=registration|year=2009|publisher=Doubleday|location=New York}}</ref>  The Giants also lost the [[1913 World Series]], a 101-win season cemented by Mathewson's final brilliant season on the mound: a league-leading 2.06 ERA in over 300 innings pitched complemented by  0.6 bases on balls per nine innings pitched.\n\nFor the remainder of his career with the Giants, Mathewson began to struggle. Soon, the former champions fell into decline. In 1915, Mathewson's penultimate season in New York, the Giants were the worst team in the National League standings. Mathewson, who had expressed interest in serving as a manager, wound up with a three-year deal to manage the Cincinnati Reds effective July 21, 1916.<ref name=\"RRBio\" />\n\n===Three years with the Reds===\n[[File:1904 Christy Mathewson-restore.jpg|thumb|Mathewson in 1904]]\nOn July 20, {{mlby|1916}}, Mathewson's career came full circle when he was traded to the Cincinnati Reds along with [[Edd Roush]].  He was immediately named as the Reds' [[player-manager]].  However, he appeared in only one game as a pitcher for the Reds, on September 4, 1916. He faced Brown in the second half of a doubleheader, which was billed as the final meeting between the two old baseball warriors. The high-scoring game was a win for Mathewson's Reds over Brown's Cubs, 10-8.<ref name=\"Okrent\">{{cite book|last1=Okrent|first1=Daniel|title=The Ultimate Baseball Book|date=1988|publisher=Hilltown Press|location=United States|isbn=0395361451|pages=80}}</ref>\n\nMathewson retired as a player after the season and managed the Reds for the entire 1917 season and the first 118 games of 1918, compiling a total record of 164-176 as a manager.<ref name=\"Okrent\" />\n\n==Personal life and literary career==\n[[File:Christy and Jane Mathewson photograph, circa 1916.png|thumb|left|Mathewson and his wife Jane, circa 1916.]]\nMathewson married wife Jane in 1903. Their only son, Christopher Jr., was born shortly after.  Christy Mathewson Jr. served in World War II, and died in an explosion at his home in Texas in 1950. During Mathewson's playing years, the family lived in a duplex in upper Manhattan alongside Mathewson's manager John McGraw and his wife Blanche. Mathewson and McGraw remained friends for the rest of their lives. In the 1909 offseason, Christy Mathewson's younger brother Nicholas Mathewson committed suicide in a neighbor's barn. Another brother, [[Henry Mathewson]], pitched briefly for the Giants before dying of tuberculosis in 1917.\n\nMathewson was highly regarded in the baseball world during his lifetime. As he was a clean-cut, intellectual collegiate, his rise to fame brought a better name to the typical ballplayer, who usually spent his time gambling, boozing, or womanizing. However, reports indicate Mathewson was racist given his close friendship with Ty Cobb .  As noted in ''[[The National League Story]]'' (1961) by [[Lee Allen (baseball)|Lee Allen]], Mathewson was a devout Christian and never pitched on Sunday, a promise he made to his mother that brought him popularity among the more religious New York fans. However, the impact of this practice on the Giants was minimized, since, in the eight-team National League, only the [[Chicago Cubs]] ([[Illinois]]), [[Cincinnati Reds]] ([[Ohio]]), and [[St. Louis Cardinals]] ([[Missouri]]) played home games in states that allowed professional sports on Sunday.\n\nIn his free time, Mathewson enjoyed nature walks, reading, golf, and checkers, of which he was a renowned champion player. The combination of athletic skill and intellectual hobbies made him a favorite for many fans, even those opposed to the Giants. Sportswriters praised him, and in his prime every game he started began with deafening cheers. Sometimes, the distraction prompted him to walk out 10 minutes after his fielders took the field.  Mathewson soon became the unspoken captain of the Giants. He was the only player to whom John McGraw ever gave full discretion. McGraw told many younger players to watch and listen to his wisdom.\n\nMathewson garnered respect throughout the baseball world as a pitcher of great sportsmanship. He was often asked to write columns concerning upcoming games. In 1912, Mathewson published his classic memoir ''Pitching in a Pinch,'' or Pitching from the Inside,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Pitching in a Pinch, or Baseball from the Inside|last=Mathewson|first=Christy|publisher=G.B.

Some historians speculate that the Giants got word that their star pitcher was risking his baseball career for the Stars and ordered him to stop, while others feel that the Stars' coach, [[Willis Richardson (American football)|Willis Richardson]], got rid of Mathewson because he felt that, since the fullback's [[Punt (gridiron football)|punting skills]] were hardly used, he could replace him with a local player, Shirley Ellis.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Dave Berry and the Philadelphia Story |journal=Coffin Corner |publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association |volume=2 |issue=Annual |year=1980 |pages=1\u20139 |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/02-An-053.pdf |first=Bob |last=Carroll |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127040523/http://profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/02-An-053.pdf |archive-date=November 27, 2010 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n===Career with the Giants===\n[[File:Mathewson in NY uniform.jpg|thumb|Mathewson in his New York Giants uniform]]\nDuring his 17-year career, Mathewson won 373 games and lost 188 for a .665 winning percentage. His career [[Earned run average|ERA]] of 2.13 and 79 career [[shutout#Baseball|shutouts]] are among the best all time for pitchers, and his 373 [[win (baseball)|wins]] are still number one in the National League, tied with [[Grover Cleveland Alexander]]. He employed a good fastball, outstanding control, and, especially a new pitch he termed the \"fadeaway\" (later known in baseball as the \"[[screwball]]\"), which he learned from teammate [[Dave Williams (1900s pitcher)|Dave Williams]] in 1898.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Neyer/James Guide to Pitchers|author=Bill James|author2=Rob Neyer|author-link=Bill James|author2-link=Rob Neyer|last-author-amp=yes|year=2004|page=296|title-link=The Neyer/James Guide to Pitchers}}</ref>\n\nThis reference is challenged by Ken Burns documentary ''[[Baseball (TV series)|Baseball]]'' in which it is stated that Mathewson learned his \"fadeaway\" from [[Rube Foster|Andrew \"Rube\" Foster]] when New York Giants manager [[John McGraw|John Joseph McGraw]] quietly hired Rube to show the Giants bullpen what he knew. Many baseball historians consider this story apocryphal.\n\nMathewson recorded 2,507 career [[strikeout]]s against only 848 [[base on balls|walks]]. He is famous for his 25 pitching duels with [[Mordecai Brown|Mordecai \"Three Finger\" Brown]], who won 13 of the duels against Mathewson's 11, with one no-decision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Christy_Mathewson_1878&page=chronology|title=''The Ballplayers: Christy Mathewson''|publisher=BaseballLibrary.com|date=September 4, 1916|access-date=2009-04-03|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414040144/http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Christy_Mathewson_1878&page=chronology|archive-date=April 14, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nMathewson was a very good-hitting pitcher in his major league career, posting a .215 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] (362-for-1687) with\n151 [[run (baseball)|runs]], seven [[home runs]], and 167 [[RBI]]. In 10 of his 17 years in the majors, he was in double figures in RBIs, with a season-high of 20 in 1903. He batted .281 (9-for-32) in 11 World Series games.\n\nFrom 1900 to 1904, Mathewson established himself as a premier pitcher. Posting low ERAs and winning nearly 100 games, Mathewson helped McGraw raise the Giants' place in the standings. Though no World Series was held in 1904, the Giants captured the pennant, prompting McGraw to proclaim them as the best team in the world.\n\nMathewson strove even harder in 1905. After switching to catcher, [[Roger Bresnahan]] had begun collaborating with Mathewson, whose advanced memory of hitter weaknesses paved the way for a historic season. Pinpoint control guided Mathewson's pitches to Bresnahan's glove. In 338 innings, Mathewson walked only 64 batters. He shut out opposing teams eight times, pitching entire games in brief 90-minute sessions. Besides winning 31 games, Mathewson allowed only 1.28 earned runs for every nine innings. His 206 strikeouts led the league, earning him the [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown|Triple Crown]].<ref name=\"RRBio\">{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=Ray|title=Matty : an American hero|year=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-509263-9}}</ref>\n\nMathewson's Giants won the [[1905 World Series]] over the [[Philadelphia Athletics]]. Mathewson was the starting pitcher in game one, and pitched a four-hit [[shutouts in baseball|shutout]] for the victory. Three days later, with the series tied 1\u20131, he pitched another four-hit shutout. Then, two days later in game five, he threw a six-hit shutout to clinch the series for the Giants. In a span of only six days, Mathewson had pitched three complete games without allowing a run, while giving up only 14 hits.\n\nIn the next year, Mathewson lost much of his edge, owing to an early-season diagnosis of [[diphtheria]]. McGraw pulled over 260 innings from him, but these were plagued with struggle. Though he maintained a 22-12 record, his 2.97 ERA was well above the league average of 2.62. His 1.271 WHIP, quite uncharacteristic of him, was due to an increased number of hits and walks.\n\n[[File:Christy Mathewson 1913.jpg|thumb|left|Mathewson with the New York Giants, around 1913]]\nBy 1908, Mathewson was back on top as the league's elite pitcher. Winning the most games of his career, 37, coupled with a 1.43 ERA and 259 strikeouts, he claimed a second Triple Crown. He also led the league in innings pitched and shutouts, and held hitters to an exceptionally low 0.827 WHIP. Unfortunately, the Giants were unable to take home the pennant due to what was ultimately known as [[Merkle's Boner]], an incident that cost the Giants a crucial game against the Chicago Cubs, who eventually defeated the Giants in the standings by one game.\n\nMathewson returned for an incredible 1909 season, posting better numbers than the previous year. He repeated a strong performance in 1910 and then again in 1911, when the Giants captured their first pennant since 1905. The Giants ultimately lost the [[1911 World Series]] to the Philadelphia Athletics, the same team they had defeated for the 1905 championship. Mathewson and [[Rube Marquard]] allowed two game-winning home runs to Hall of Famer [[Home Run Baker|Frank Baker]], earning him the nickname, \"Home Run\".<ref name=\"RRBio\" /> Mathewson, the team's \"star pitcher\", signed a three-year contract with the Giants in late 1910, for the upcoming 1911, 1912 and 1913 seasons, the first time he had signed a contract over a year in length. <ref> {{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Matty Signs up for Three Years |url=http://nyshistoricnewspapers.org/lccn/sn85054113/1910-11-15/ed-1/seq-7/ |work=The Ogdensburg Journal |location=Ogdensburg, NY |date=November 15, 1910 |access-date=October 16, 2019 }} </ref>\n\nIn 1912, Mathewson gave another stellar performance. Capturing the pennant, the Giants were fueled by the stolen-base game and a superior pitching staff capped by Rube Marquard, the \"11,000-dollar lemon\" who turned around to win 26 games, 19 of them consecutively. In the [[1912 World Series]], the Giants faced the Boston Red Sox, the 1904 American League pennant winners who were to face the Giants in the World Series that year had it not been cancelled. Though Mathewson threw three complete games and maintained an ERA below 1.00, numerous errors by the Giants, including a lazy popup dropped by Fred Snodgrass in game seven, cost them the championship.<ref>{{cite book|last=Vaccaro|first=Mike|title=First Fall Classic|url=https://archive.org/details/firstfallclassic00mike|url-access=registration|year=2009|publisher=Doubleday|location=New York}}</ref>  The Giants also lost the [[1913 World Series]], a 101-win season cemented by Mathewson's final brilliant season on the mound: a league-leading 2.06 ERA in over 300 innings pitched complemented by  0.6 bases on balls per nine innings pitched.\n\nFor the remainder of his career with the Giants, Mathewson began to struggle. Soon, the former champions fell into decline. In 1915, Mathewson's penultimate season in New York, the Giants were the worst team in the National League standings. Mathewson, who had expressed interest in serving as a manager, wound up with a three-year deal to manage the Cincinnati Reds effective July 21, 1916.<ref name=\"RRBio\" />\n\n===Three years with the Reds===\n[[File:1904 Christy Mathewson-restore.jpg|thumb|Mathewson in 1904]]\nOn July 20, {{mlby|1916}}, Mathewson's career came full circle when he was traded to the Cincinnati Reds along with [[Edd Roush]].  He was immediately named as the Reds' [[player-manager]].  However, he appeared in only one game as a pitcher for the Reds, on September 4, 1916. He faced Brown in the second half of a doubleheader, which was billed as the final meeting between the two old baseball warriors. The high-scoring game was a win for Mathewson's Reds over Brown's Cubs, 10-8.<ref name=\"Okrent\">{{cite book|last1=Okrent|first1=Daniel|title=The Ultimate Baseball Book|date=1988|publisher=Hilltown Press|location=United States|isbn=0395361451|pages=80}}</ref>\n\nMathewson retired as a player after the season and managed the Reds for the entire 1917 season and the first 118 games of 1918, compiling a total record of 164-176 as a manager.<ref name=\"Okrent\" />\n\n==Personal life and literary career==\n[[File:Christy and Jane Mathewson photograph, circa 1916.png|thumb|left|Mathewson and his wife Jane, circa 1916.]]\nMathewson married wife Jane in 1903. Their only son, Christopher Jr., was born shortly after.  Christy Mathewson Jr. served in World War II, and died in an explosion at his home in Texas in 1950. During Mathewson's playing years, the family lived in a duplex in upper Manhattan alongside Mathewson's manager John McGraw and his wife Blanche. Mathewson and McGraw remained friends for the rest of their lives. In the 1909 offseason, Christy Mathewson's younger brother Nicholas Mathewson committed suicide in a neighbor's barn. Another brother, [[Henry Mathewson]], pitched briefly for the Giants before dying of tuberculosis in 1917.\n\nMathewson was highly regarded in the baseball world during his lifetime. As he was a clean-cut, intellectual collegiate, his rise to fame brought a better name to the typical ballplayer, who usually spent his time gambling, boozing, or womanizing. As noted in ''[[The National League Story]]'' (1961) by [[Lee Allen (baseball)|Lee Allen]], Mathewson was a devout Christian and never pitched on Sunday, a promise he made to his mother that brought him popularity among the more religious New York fans. However, the impact of this practice on the Giants was minimized, since, in the eight-team National League, only the [[Chicago Cubs]] ([[Illinois]]), [[Cincinnati Reds]] ([[Ohio]]), and [[St. Louis Cardinals]] ([[Missouri]]) played home games in states that allowed professional sports on Sunday.\n\nIn his free time, Mathewson enjoyed nature walks, reading, golf, and checkers, of which he was a renowned champion player. The combination of athletic skill and intellectual hobbies made him a favorite for many fans, even those opposed to the Giants. Sportswriters praised him, and in his prime every game he started began with deafening cheers. Sometimes, the distraction prompted him to walk out 10 minutes after his fielders took the field.  Mathewson soon became the unspoken captain of the Giants. He was the only player to whom John McGraw ever gave full discretion. McGraw told many younger players to watch and listen to his wisdom.\n\nMathewson garnered respect throughout the baseball world as a pitcher of great sportsmanship. He was often asked to write columns concerning upcoming games. In 1912, Mathewson published his classic memoir ''Pitching in a Pinch,'' or Pitching from the Inside,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Pitching in a Pinch, or Baseball from the Inside|last=Mathewson|first=Christy|publisher=G.B.

Sensing defeat, some of the militants  started to flee from the spot, but 2nd Lt Raman chased them and killed one more militant. However one of the  militants emerged from his hiding position and sprayed bullets on him severely injuring him. Even this did not deter him and he threw a grenade at another militant killing him.
