The video discusses the alleged fear generated in coalition forces by insurgency snipers and shows \"Juba\" returning from a sniping mission, marking a tally of  37 on a wall. The sniper then sits down to make a diary entry. The video claims that there are dozens of snipers operating within the IAI and other factions, and shows more being trained. The rest of the video shows numerous clips of U.S. soldiers being sniped with ''[[nasheed]]'' music in the background, and an insurgent commander explaining that his men are inspired and trained to an extent based on the information in the book ''[[The Ultimate Sniper]]'' by retired Major and [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] sniper [[John Plaster]].\n\n=== Third and fourth videos ===\nIn December 2007, \"Juba - The Baghdad Sniper 3\" was released on the Internet.
