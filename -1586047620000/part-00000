The first four are written as [[acrostic]]s \u2013 chapters 1, 2, and 4 each have 22 verses, corresponding to the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet, the first lines beginning with the first letter of the alphabet, the second with the second letter, and so on.

The first chapter uses standard alphabetical order.\n\n==Summary==\nThe book consists of five separate poems. In the first (chapter 1), the city sits as a desolate weeping widow overcome with miseries. In Chapter 2 these miseries are described in connection with national sins and acts of God. Chapter 3 speaks of hope for the people of God: the chastisement would only be for their good; a better day would dawn for them. Chapter 4 laments the ruin and desolation of the city and temple, but traces it to the people's sins. Chapter 5 is a prayer that Zion's reproach may be taken away in the repentance and recovery of the people.\n\n==Composition==\n[[File:Schnorr von Carolsfeld Bibel in Bildern 1860 141.png|thumb|right|The lamentations of Jeremiah are depicted in this 1860 woodcut by [[Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld]]]]\nLamentations has traditionally been ascribed to [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]], probably on the grounds of the reference in 2 Chronicles 35:25 to the prophet composing a lament on the death of King [[Josiah]], but there is no reference to Josiah in the book and no reason to connect it to Jeremiah.{{sfn|Clines|2003|p=617}} \nThe language fits an [[Babylonian Exile|Exilic]] date (586\u2013520&nbsp;BCE), and the poems probably originated from Judeans who remained in the land.{{sfn|Dobbs-Allsopp|2002|pp=4\u20135}} Scholars are divided over whether they are the work of one or multiple authors.{{sfn|Dobbs-Allsopp|2002|pp=4\u20135}} One clue pointing to multiple authors is that the gender and situation of the first-person witness changes \u2013 the narration is feminine in the first and second lamentation, and masculine in the third, while the fourth and fifth are eyewitness reports of Jerusalem's destruction;{{sfn|Lee|2008|pp=566\u2013567}} conversely, the similarities of style, vocabulary, and theological outlook, as well as the uniform historical setting, are arguments for one author.<ref>F. B.

Sufferers in the face of grief are not urged to a confidence in the goodness of God; in fact God is accountable for the disaster. The poet acknowledges that this suffering is a just punishment, still God is held to have had choice over whether to act in this way and at this time. Hope arises from a recollection of God's past goodness, but although this justifies a cry to God to act in deliverance, there is no guarantee that he will. Repentance will not persuade God to be gracious, since he is free to give or withhold grace as he chooses. In the end, the possibility is that God has finally rejected his people and may not again deliver them. Nevertheless, it also affirms confidence that the mercies of Yahweh (the God of Israel) never end, but are new every morning (3:22\u201333).{{sfn|Clines|2003|pp=617\u2013618}}\n\n==Later interpretation and influence==\nThe Book of Lamentations is recited annually by Jews on Tisha b'Av (Ninth of Av), the anniversary of the destruction of both of the Jewish Temples.\n\nIn [[Western Christianity]], readings (often chanted) and choral settings of extracts from the book are used in the [[Lent]]en religious service known as [[Tenebrae]] (Latin for ''darkness''). In the [[Church of England]], readings are used at [[Morning Prayer (Anglican)|Morning]] and [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evening Prayer]] on the [[Holy Monday|Monday]] and [[Holy Tuesday|Tuesday]] of [[Holy Week]], and at Evening Prayer on [[Good Friday]].\n\nIn the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]], the book's third chapter is chanted on the twelfth hour of the Good Friday service, that commemorates the burial of Jesus.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n* {{Cite book\n|last                              = Berlin\n|first                             = Adele\n|title                             = Lamentations: A Commentary\n|publisher                         = Westminster John Knox Press\n|year                              = 2004\n|url                               = https://books.google.com/?id=iTH9qth5cbEC\n|ref                               = harv\n|isbn                             = 9780664229740\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n|last                              = Clines\n|first                             = David J.A.\n|chapter                           = Lamentations\n|editor1-last                      = Dunn\n|editor1-first                     = James D.

In the end, the possibility is that God has finally rejected his people and may not again deliver them: if God is predictable, then God is just a tool of humans. Nevertheless, it also affirms confidence that the mercies of Yahweh (the God of Israel) never end, but are new every morning (3:22\u201333).{{sfn|Clines|2003|pp=617\u2013618}}\n\n==Later interpretation and influence==\nThe Book of Lamentations is recited annually by Jews on Tisha b'Av (Ninth of Av), the anniversary of the destruction of both of the Jewish Temples.\n\nIn [[Western Christianity]], readings (often chanted) and choral settings of extracts from the book are used in the [[Lent]]en religious service known as [[Tenebrae]] (Latin for ''darkness''). In the [[Church of England]], readings are used at [[Morning Prayer (Anglican)|Morning]] and [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evening Prayer]] on the [[Holy Monday|Monday]] and [[Holy Tuesday|Tuesday]] of [[Holy Week]], and at Evening Prayer on [[Good Friday]].\n\nIn the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]], the book's third chapter is chanted on the twelfth hour of the Good Friday service, that commemorates the burial of Jesus.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n* {{Cite book\n|last                              = Berlin\n|first                             = Adele\n|title                             = Lamentations: A Commentary\n|publisher                         = Westminster John Knox Press\n|year                              = 2004\n|url                               = https://books.google.com/?id=iTH9qth5cbEC\n|ref                               = harv\n|isbn                             = 9780664229740\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n|last                              = Clines\n|first                             = David J.A.\n|chapter                           = Lamentations\n|editor1-last                      = Dunn\n|editor1-first                     = James D.
