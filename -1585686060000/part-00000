[[Nice C\u00f4te d'Azur Airport|Nice's airport]] serves as a gateway to the region.\n\nThe city is nicknamed ''Nice la Belle'' (''[[Nissa La Bella]]'' in [[Ni\u00e7ard]]), which means ''Nice the Beautiful'', which is also the title of the unofficial anthem of Nice, written by [[Menica Rondelly]] in 1912. The area of today's Nice contains [[Terra Amata (archaeological site)|Terra Amata]], an archaeological site which displays evidence of a very early use of fire 380,000 years ago.

Its strategic location and port significantly contributed to its maritime strength. For centuries it was a dominion of [[Duchy of Savoy|Savoy]], and was then part of France between 1792 and 1815, when it was returned to the [[Piedmont-Sardinia|Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]] until its re-annexation by France in 1860.\n\nThe natural environment of the Nice area and its mild Mediterranean climate came to the attention of the English upper classes in the second half of the 18th century, when an increasing number of aristocratic families took to spending their winters there. The city's main seaside promenade, the [[Promenade des Anglais]] (\"Walkway of the English\") owes its name to visitors to the resort.<ref>Alain Ruggiero, op. cit., p. 137</ref>\nThe clear air and soft light have particularly appealed to notable painters, such as [[Marc Chagall]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Niki de Saint Phalle]] and [[Arman]].

The city soon became one of the busiest trading ports on the Ligurian coast; but it had an important rival in the Roman town of [[Cemenelum]], which continued to exist as a separate city until the time of the [[Lombards|Lombard]] invasions.<ref name=EB1911/> The ruins of Cemenelum are in [[Cimiez]], now a district of Nice.\n\n===Early development===\n{{See also|Roman Catholic Diocese of Nice|County of Nice}}\n[[File:Nice tour Saint-Francois.jpg|thumb|upright|The Tower of St Fran\u00e7ois]]\n\nIn the 7th century, Nice joined the [[Genoa|Genoese]] League formed by the towns of [[Liguria]]. In 729 the city repulsed the [[Saracens]]; but in 859 and again in 880 the Saracens pillaged and burned it, and for most of the 10th century remained masters of the surrounding country.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], Nice participated in the wars and [[history of Italy]]. As an ally of [[Pisa]] it was the enemy of [[Genoa]], and both the [[King of France]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]] endeavoured to subjugate it; but in spite of this it maintained its municipal liberties. During the 13th and 14th centuries the city fell more than once into the hands of the [[Counts of Provence]],<ref name=EB1911/> but it regained its independence even though related to Genoa.\n\n[[File:Italia 1494-es.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Duchy of Savoy (red) and other independent Italian states in 1494]]\n\n===Defences===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\nThe medieval city walls surrounded the Old Town. The landward side was protected by the River [[Paillon]], which was later covered over and is now the tram route towards the Acropolis.\n\nThe east side of the town was protected by fortifications on [[Castle of Nice#Castle Hill|Castle Hill]]. Another river flowed into the port on the east side of Castle Hill. Engravings suggest that the port area was also defended by walls.\n\nUnder [[Monoprix]] in Place de Garibaldi are excavated remains of a well-defended city gate on the main road from [[Turin]].\n\n===Nice and Savoy===\n{{See also|Duchy of Savoy}}\n[[File:Plan-Nice-1624.jpg|thumb|Nice in 1624]]\n[[File:Italia 1843.svg|thumb|upright=0.75|Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia (blue) and other independent Italian states in 1843]]\n\nIn 1388 the commune placed itself under the protection of the [[County of Savoy|Counts of Savoy]].<ref name=EB1911/> Nice participated \u2013 directly or indirectly \u2013 in the history of [[Savoy]] until 1860. {{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe maritime strength of Nice now rapidly increased until it was able to cope with the [[Barbary pirates]]; the fortifications were largely extended and the roads to the city improved.<ref name=EB1911/> In 1561 [[Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy]] abolished the use of Latin as an administrative language and established the [[Italian language]] as the official language of government affairs in Nice.\n\nDuring the struggle between [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] and [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] great damage was caused by the passage of the armies invading [[Provence]]; [[infectious disease|pestilence]] and famine raged in the city for several years.<ref name=EB1911/> In 1538, in the nearby town of [[Villeneuve-Loubet]], through the mediation of [[Pope Paul III]], the two monarchs concluded a [[Truce of Nice|ten years' truce]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://villeneuveloubethotelreservation.com/articles/the-chateau-of-villeneuve-loubet| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426212438/http://villeneuveloubethotelreservation.com/articles/the-chateau-of-villeneuve-loubet| url-status=dead| archive-date=26 April 2014| title=The Chsteau of Villeneuve-Loubet| publisher=Villeneuve-Loubet Guide and Hotels| accessdate=30 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 1543, Nice was attacked by the united [[Franco-Ottoman alliance|Franco-Ottoman forces]] of Francis I and [[Hayreddin Barbarossa|Barbarossa Hayreddin Pasha]], in the [[Siege of Nice]]; though the inhabitants repulsed the assault which followed the terrible bombardment, they were ultimately compelled to surrender, and Barbarossa was allowed to pillage the city and to carry off 2,500 captives. Pestilence appeared again in 1550 and 1580.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn 1600, Nice was briefly taken by the [[House of Guise|Duke of Guise]]. By opening the ports of the county to all nations, and proclaiming full freedom of trade (1626), the commerce of the city was given great stimulus, the noble families taking part in its mercantile enterprises.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nCaptured by [[Nicolas Catinat]] in 1691, Nice was restored to [[Savoy]] in 1696; but [[Siege of Nice (1705)|it was again besieged by the French in 1705]], and in the following year its [[citadel]] and [[Defensive wall|rampart]]s were demolished.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)]] once more gave the city back to the Duke of Savoy, who was on that same occasion recognised as King of Sicily. In the peaceful years which followed, the \"new town\" was built. From 1744 until the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)]] the French and Spaniards were again in possession. In 1775 the king, who in 1718 had swapped his sovereignty of Sicily for the Kingdom of Sardinia, destroyed all that remained of the ancient liberties of the [[Commune in France|commune]]. Conquered in 1792 by the armies of the [[First French Republic]], the County of Nice continued to be part of France until 1814; but after that date it reverted to the [[Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===French Nice===\nAfter the [[Treaty of Turin (1860)|Treaty of Turin]] was signed in 1860 between the [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Sardinian king]] and [[Napoleon III]], the County was again and definitively ceded to France as a territorial reward for French assistance in the [[Second Italian War of Independence]] against [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], which saw [[Lombardy]] united with [[Piedmont-Sardinia]]. The cession was ratified by a regional [[referendum]]: over 25,000 electors out of a total of 30,700 were in favour of the attachment to [[France]].<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|wstitle=Nice (France)|volume=19|pages=646\u2013647|inline=1}}</ref> Savoy was also transferred to the French crown by similar means. [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], born in Nice, opposed the cession to France, arguing that the ballot was rigged by the French. \nMany Italians from Nizza then moved to the Ligurian towns of [[Ventimiglia]], [[Bordighera]] and [[Ospedaletti]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.liberanissa.eu/archives/nizza_e_il_suo_futuro/index.html|title=Nizza e il suo futuro|publisher=Liber\u00e0 Nissa|language=Italian|access-date=26 December 2018}}</ref> giving rise to a local branch of the movement of the [[Italia irredenta|Italian irredentists]] which considered the re-acquisition of Nice to be one of their nationalist goals.\n\nIn 1900, the [[Trams in Nice|Tramway de Nice]] electrified its horse-drawn streetcars and spread its network to the entire ''d\u00e9partement'' from [[Menton]] to [[Cagnes-sur-Mer]]. By the 1930s more bus connections were added in the area.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} In the 1930s, Nice hosted international car racing in the [[Formula Libre]] (predecessor to [[Formula One]]) on the so-called Circuit Nice. The circuit started along the waterfront just south of the Jardin Albert I, then headed westward along the [[Promenade des Anglais]] followed by a hairpin turn at the [[Hotel Negresco]] to come back eastward and around the Jardin Albert I before heading again east along the beach on the Quai des Etats-Unis.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bestofniceblog.com/history-nice-france/nice-grand-prix/|title=Nice Grand Prix|access-date=25 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nAs war broke out in September 1939, Nice became a city of refuge for many displaced foreigners, notably Jews fleeing the Nazi progression into Eastern Europe. From Nice many sought further shelter in the [[French colonial empire|French colonies]], Morocco and North and South America. After July 1940 and the establishment of the [[Vichy France|Vichy Regime]], [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] aggressions accelerated the exodus, starting in July 1941 and continuing through 1942. On 26 August 1942, 655 Jews of foreign origin were rounded up by the Laval government and interned in the Auvare barracks. Of these, 560 were deported to [[Drancy internment camp]] on 31 August 1942. Due to the activity of the Jewish banker [[Angelo Donati]] and of the Capuchin friar [[P\u00e8re Marie-Beno\u00eet]] the local authorities hindered the application of anti-Jewish Vichy laws.<ref>L\u00e9on Poliakov, ''La conditions des Juifs sous l'occupation italienne'', Paris, CDJC, 1946 and bibliographies of [[Angelo Donati]] and [[P\u00e8re Marie-Beno\u00eet]]</ref>\n\nThe first [[French Resistance|''r\u00e9sistants'']] to the new regime were a group of High School seniors of the Lyc\u00e9e de Nice, now {{ill|Lyc\u00e9e Mass\u00e9na|fr}}, in September 1940, later arrested and executed in 1944 near [[Verdon Gorge|Castellane]]. The first public demonstrations occurred on 14 July 1942 when several hundred protesters took to the streets along the Avenue de la Victoire and in the Place Mass\u00e9na. In November 1942 German troops moved into most of unoccupied France, but Italian troops moved into a smaller zone including Nice. A certain ambivalence remained among the population, many of whom were recent immigrants of Italian ancestry. However, the resistance gained momentum after the Italian surrender in 1943 when the German army occupied the former Italian zone. Reprisals intensified between December 1943 and July 1944, when many partisans were tortured and executed by the local [[Gestapo]] and the [[Milice|French Milice]]. Nice was also heavily bombarded by American aircraft in preparation for the Allied [[Operation Dragoon|landing in Provence]] (1000 dead or wounded and more than 5600 people homeless) and famine ensued during summer 1944.\nAmerican paratroopers entered the city on 30 August 1944 and Nice was finally liberated.\nThe consequences of the war were heavy: the population decreased by 15% {{citation needed|date=November 2017}} and economic life was totally disrupted.\n[[File:Colline du chateau waterfall.jpg|thumb|The waterfall on the Colline du Ch\u00e2teau (Castle Hill)]]\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, Nice enjoyed an economic boom primarily driven by tourism and construction. Two men dominated this period: [[Jean M\u00e9decin]], [[Mayor (France)|mayor]] for 33 years from 1928 to 1943 and from 1947 to 1965, and his son [[Jacques M\u00e9decin|Jacques]], mayor for 24 years from 1966 to 1990. Under their leadership, there was extensive urban renewal, including many new constructions. These included the convention centre, theatres, new thoroughfares and expressways. The arrival of the [[Pied-Noir|Pieds-Noirs]], refugees from Algeria after 1962 independence, also gave the city a boost and somewhat changed the make-up of its population and traditional views. {{citation needed|date=November 2017}} By the late 1980s, rumors of political corruption in the city government surfaced; and eventually formal accusations against Jacques M\u00e9decin forced him to flee France in 1990.

The eagle standing over the three hills is a depiction of Savoy, referring to its domination over the country around Nice.<ref name=\"schor_22_23\"/> The combination of silver and red (argent and gules) is a reference to the colours of the [[Savoy|flag of Savoy]].<ref name=\"schor_22_23\"/> The three mountains symbolise a territorial honour, without concern for geographic realism.<ref name=\"schor_22_23\"/>\n\n==Geography==\n\nNice consists of two large bays. [[Villefranche-sur-Mer]] sits on an enclosed bay, while the main expanse of the city lies between the old port city and the Aeroport de C\u00f4te d'Azur, across a gently curving bay. The city rises from the flat beach into gentle rising hills, then is bounded by surrounding mountains that represent the Southern and nearly the Western extent of the [[Ligurian Alps]] range.\n\n===Flora===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\nThe natural vegetation of Nice is typical for a Mediterranean landscape, with a heavy representation of broadleaf evergreen shrubs. Trees tend to be scattered but form dense forests in some areas. Large native tree species include evergreens such as [[Quercus ilex|holm oak]], [[stone pine]] and [[arbutus]]. Many introduced species grow in parks and gardens. [[Palm tree|Palm]]s, [[eucalyptus]] and [[citrus fruit]]s are among the trees which give Nice a subtropical appearance. But there are also species familiar to temperate areas around the world; examples include [[Horse-chestnut (tree)|horse chestnut]], [[Tilia|linden]] and even [[Norway spruce]].\n\n===Climate===\nNice has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Csa'') with characteristics of a [[warm-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] : ''Csb''), enjoying mild winters with moderate rainfall. It is one of the warmest Mediterranean climates for its latitude. Summers are warm to hot, dry, and sunny. Rainfall is rare in this season, and a typical July month only records one or two days with measurable rainfall. The temperature is typically above {{convert|26|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} but rarely above {{convert|32|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. The climate data is recorded from the airport, located just metres from the sea. Summer temperatures, therefore, are often higher in the city. The average maximum temperature in the warmest months of July and August is about {{convert|27|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. The highest recorded temperature  was {{convert|37.7|\u00b0C|1|abbr=on}} on 1 August 2006. Autumn generally starts sunny in September and becomes more cloudy and rainy towards October, while temperatures usually remain above {{convert|20|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} until November where days start to cool down to around {{convert|17|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nWinters are characterised by mild days ({{convert|11|to|17|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}}), cool nights ({{convert|4|to|9|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}}), and variable weather. Days can be either sunny and dry or damp and rainy. The average minimum temperature in January is around {{convert|5|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. Frost is unusual and snowfalls are rare. The most recent snowfall in Nice was on 26 February 2018.<ref>\"[https://www.thelocal.fr/20180226/in-pictures-french-riviera-in-the-snow French Riviera hit by snowfall]\". ''The Local fr''.

tourism==\n[[File:NiceVieuxCartier.JPG|thumb|View of the old town]]\nNice is the seat of the [[Chambre de commerce et d'industrie Nice C\u00f4te d'Azur]], which manages the Port of Nice. Investors from France and abroad can benefit from the assistance of the C\u00f4te d'Azur Economic Development Agency [[Team C\u00f4te d'Azur]].\n\nNice has one conference centre: the [[Palais des Congr\u00e8s Acropolis]]. The city also has several business parks, including [[Districts of businesses Ni\u00e7oise L' Arenas|l'Arenas]], [[Districts of Ni\u00e7oise Nice businesses Plaine|Nice the Plain]], [[Districts of businesses Ni\u00e7oise Nice M\u00e9ridia|Nice M\u00e9ridia]], [[Districts of businesses Ni\u00e7oise Saint Isidore|Saint Isidore]], and the Northern Forum.\n\nIn addition, the city features several shopping centres such as Nicetoile, Nice TNL, Nice Lingosti\u00e8re, Northern Forum, St-Isidore, the Trinity (around the [[Auchan]] [[hypermarket]]), Cap3000 in [[Saint-Laurent-du-Var]] and [[Polygone Riviera]] in [[Cagnes-sur-Mer]].\n\n[[Sophia Antipolis]] is a technology park northwest of [[Antibes]]. Much of the park is within the commune of [[Valbonne]]. Established between 1970 and 1984, it primarily houses companies in the fields of computing, electronics, pharmacology and biotechnology. Several institutions of higher learning are also located here, along with the European headquarters of W3C.\n\nThe Nice metropolitan area had a [[List of cities by GDP|GDP amounting to $47.7 billion]], and $34,480 per capita,<ref name=\"Brookings\">{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/interactives/global-metro-monitor-3|title=Global city GDP 2011|publisher=Brookings Institution|accessdate=4 March 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605135349/http://www.brookings.edu/research/interactives/global-metro-monitor-3|archivedate=5 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> slightly lower than the French average.\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Port===\n[[File:Hafen von Nizza.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Port of Nice]]\nThe main port of Nice is also known as Lympia port. This name comes from the Lympia spring which fed a small lake in a marshy zone where work on the port was started in 1745. {{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} Today this is the principal harbour installation of Nice \u2013 there is also a small port in the Carras district. The port is the first port cement manufacturer in France, linked to the treatment plants of the rollers of the valley of Paillon. Fishing activities remain but the number of professional fishermen is now less than 10. {{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} Nice, being the point of continental France nearest to [[Corsica]], has ferry connections with the island developed with the arrival of NGV (''navires \u00e0 grande vitesse'') or [[high-speed craft]]. The connections are provided by [[Corsica Ferries - Sardinia Ferries]]. Located in front of the port, the Place Cassini has been renamed Place of Corsica.\n\n===Airport===\n\n[[Nice C\u00f4te d'Azur Airport]] is the third busiest airport in France after [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]] and [[Orly Airport]], both near Paris. It is on the [[Promenade des Anglais]], near l'Ar\u00e9nas and has two [[Airport terminal|terminals]]. Due to its proximity to the Principality of [[Monaco]], it also serves as that city\u2013state's airport. A helicopter service provided by [[Heli Air Monaco]] and [[Monacair]] links the city and airport. It is run by the ACA (A\u00e9roports C\u00f4te d'Azur), which includes [[Cannes - Mandelieu Airport]] and [[La M\u00f4le \u2013 Saint-Tropez Airport]]. Public transportation into the city proper is serviced by the [[Nice tramway|Tramway]] line 2 (T2).\n\n===Rail===\n\nThe main railway station is [[Gare de Nice-Ville|Nice-Ville]], served both by high speed [[TGV]] trains connecting Paris and Nice in less than 6 hours and by local commuter [[TER Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te-d'Azur|TER]] services. [[Gare de Marseille-Saint-Charles|Marseille]] is reached in 2.5 hours. Nice also has international connections to Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, and Russia.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11400917|title=French Riviera train for Russia|work=BBC News  |date=23 September 2010|accessdate=24 September 2010}}</ref> Nice is also served by several suburban stations including [[Gare de Nice-Saint-Augustin|Nice St-Augustin]], Nice St-Roch and [[Gare de Nice-Riquier|Nice Riquier]].\n\nNice is also the southern terminus of the independently run [[Chemins de Fer de Provence]] railway line which connects the city with [[Digne]] in approximatively 4 hours. A metro-like suburban service is also provided on the southern part of the line.\n\n===Tram===\n[[Trams in Nice|Tramway de Nice]] began operating horse-drawn trams in 1879. Electrified in 1900, the combined length of the network reached {{convert|144|km|2|abbr=on}} by 1930. The replacement of trams with [[trolleybus]]es began in 1948 and was completed in 1953.\n\nIn 2007, the new [[Nice tramway|Tramway de Nice]] linked the northern and eastern suburbs via the city centre. Two other lines are currently under construction and partly operating. The second line runs east-west from [[Avenue Jean M\u00e9decin|Jean M\u00e9decin]] to the [[Nice C\u00f4te d'Azur Airport]] (and will reach the Port at the end of 2019), while the third line will provide a connection to the future TGV Nice Saint-Augustin and to Lingosti\u00e8re railway station.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tramway.nice.fr/La-ligne-1/Dates-et-chiffres-cles |title=Dates et chiffres cl\u00e9s / La ligne 1 / Accueil \u2013 Tramway de la Communaut\u00e9 Urbaine Nice C\u00f4te d'Azur |language=fr |publisher=Tramway.nice.fr |date= |accessdate=15 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906064924/http://tramway.nice.fr/La-ligne-1/Dates-et-chiffres-cles |archivedate=6 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> A fourth line is set to run from the future TGV Nice Saint-Augustin to [[Cagnes-sur-Mer]].\n\n===Road===\n\nThe [[A8 autoroute]] and the [[Route nationale 7]] pass through the Nice agglomeration.\n\n==Sights==\n{{wide image|Nice Panorama Beachfront Cropped.jpg|900px|alt=|align-cap=center|Panorama of the town (including many main sights, like Hotel Negresco) and the beach}}\n{{wide image|Nice from Castle Hill 01.jpg|900px|alt=|align-cap=center|Panorama of Nice from Colline du Ch\u00e2teau}}\n[[File:Hotel Negresco (2).JPG|thumb|[[Hotel Negresco]]]]\n[[File:Nice-seafront.jpg|thumb|Seafront of the city]]\nThe [[Promenade des Anglais]] (\"Promenade of the English\") is a promenade along the Baie des Anges (\"Bay of the Angels\"), which is a bay of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], in Nice. Before Nice was urbanised, the coastline at Nice was just bordered by a deserted stretch of [[shingle beach]] (covered with large pebbles). The first houses were located on higher ground well away from the sea, as wealthy tourists visiting Nice in the 18th century did not come for the beach, but for the gentle winter weather. {{citation needed|date=January 2018}} The areas close to the water were home to Nice's dockworkers and fishermen.\n\nIn the second half of the 18th century, many wealthy English people took to spending the winter in Nice, enjoying the panorama along the coast. When a particularly harsh winter up north brought an influx of beggars to Nice, some of the rich Englishmen proposed a useful project for them: the construction of a walkway (''chemin de promenade'') along the sea. {{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe city of Nice, intrigued by the prospect of a pleasant promenade, greatly increased the scope of the work. The Promenade was first called the ''Camin dei Angl\u00e8s'' (the English Way) by the Ni\u00e7ois in their native dialect, [[Ni\u00e7ard|Nissart]]. After the annexation of Nice by France in 1860 it was rechristened ''La Promenade des Anglais'', replacing the former Nissart name with its French translation. {{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe [[Hotel Negresco]] on the Promenade des Anglais was named after [[Henri Negresco]] (1868\u20131920) who had the palatial hotel constructed in 1912. In keeping with the conventions of the time, when the Negresco first opened in 1913 its front opened on the side opposite the Mediterranean. {{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nAnother place worth mentioning is the small street parallel to the Promenade des Anglais, leading from Nice's downtown, beginning at Place Mass\u00e9na and running parallel to the promenade in the direction of the airport for a short distance of about 4 blocks. This section of the city is referred to as the \"Zone Pietonne\", or \"Pedestrian Zone\". Cars are not allowed (with exception to delivery trucks), making this avenue a popular walkway.\n\nOld Nice is also home to the [[Op\u00e9ra de Nice]]. It was constructed at the end of the 19th century under the design of Fran\u00e7ois Aune, to replace King Charles F\u00e9lix's Maccarani Theater. Today, it is open to the public and provides a regular program of performances.\n\nOther sights include:\n* [[Castle of Nice|Ch\u00e2teau]]\n* ''Monument aux morts''\n* The port\n* ''Cours Saleya''\n* ''[[Jardin botanique de la Ville de Nice]]'' (botanical garden)\n* '' Musee Massena''\n* ''March\u00e9 aux fleurs''\n* Old Nice\n* ''Grand H\u00f4tel Imp\u00e9rial''\n* Fort of Mont Alban\n\n===Squares===\n\n====Place Mass\u00e9na====\n[[File:Placemassena1.JPG|thumb|View of the Place Mass\u00e9na]]\n[[File:Place Massena by night.jpg|thumb|Place Mass\u00e9na by night, 2012]]\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}\nThe ''Place Mass\u00e9na'' is the main square of the city. Before the [[Paillon]] River was covered over, the Pont-Neuf was the only practicable way between the old town and the modern one. The square was thus divided into two parts (North and South) in 1824. With the demolition of the Mass\u00e9na Casino in 1979, the Place Mass\u00e9na became more spacious and less dense and is now bordered by red ochre buildings of [[Italian architecture]].\n\nThe recent rebuilding of the tramline gave the square back to the pedestrians, restoring its status as a real Mediterranean square. It is lined with palm trees and stone pines, instead of being the rectangular roundabout of sorts it had become over the years. Since its construction, the Place Mass\u00e9na has always been the spot for great public events. It is used for concerts, and particularly during the summer festivals, the ''[[Nice Carnival|Corso carnavalesque]]'' (carnival parade) in February, the military procession of 14 July (Bastille Day) or other traditional celebrations and banquets.\n\nThe Place Mass\u00e9na is a two-minute walk from the [[Promenade des Anglais]], old town, town centre, and Albert I Garden (''Jardin Albert Ier''). It is also a large crossroads between several of the main streets of the city: [[avenue Jean M\u00e9decin]], ''avenue F\u00e9lix Faure'', ''boulevard Jean Jaur\u00e8s'', ''avenue de Verdun'' and ''rue Gioffredo''.\n\n====Place Garibaldi====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}\n[[File:Nice Place Garibaldi 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Garibaldi's monument, Place Garibaldi]]\nThe ''Place Garibaldi'' also stands out for its architecture and history. It is named after [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], hero of the [[Italian unification]] (born in Nice in 1807 when Nice was part of the Napoleonic Empire, before reverting to the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia). The square was built at the end of the 18th century and served as the entry gate to the city and end of the road to Turin. It took several names between 1780 and 1870 (Pla\u00e7a Pairouli\u00e8ra, Place de la R\u00e9publique, Place Napol\u00e9on, Place d'Armes, Place Saint-Augustin, Piazza Vittorio) and finally Place Garibaldi in September 1870.\n\nA statue of Garibaldi, who was fiercely in favour of the union of Nice with Italy, stands in the centre of the square. The recent rebuilding of the area to accommodate the new tramway line gave mostly the entire square to pedestrians. The architecture is in line with the Turin model, which was the norm of urban renewal throughout the entire realm of the House of Savoy.\n[[File:Nice tramway place Garibaldi.jpg|thumb|left|Place Garibaldi, pedestrian since the introduction of the Nice tramway.]]\n\nIt is a crossroads between the ''Vieux Nice'' (old town) and the town centre. Place Garibaldi is close to the eastern districts of Nice, ''Port Lympia'' (Lympia Harbour), and the TNL commercial centre. This square is also a junction of several important streets: the ''boulevard Jean-Jaur\u00e8s'', the ''avenue de la R\u00e9publique'', the ''rue Cassini'' and the ''rue Catherine-S\u00e9gurane''.\n\n====Place Rossetti====\n[[File:Cath\u00e9drale Sainte R\u00e9parate in Nice.jpg|thumb|The Cathedral]]\nEntirely enclosed and pedestrianised, this square is located in the heart of the old town. With typical buildings in red and yellow ochres surrounding the square, the ''cath\u00e9drale Sainte-R\u00e9parate'' and the fountain in the centre, ''place Rossetti'' is a must-see spot in the old town. By day, the place is invaded by the terraces of traditional restaurants and the finest ice-cream makers. By night, the environment changes radically, with tourists and youths flocking to the square, where music reverberates on the walls of the small square. The square's lighting at night gives it a magical aspect.\n\nPlace Rossetti is in the centre of the old town, streets ''Jesus'', ''Rossetti'', ''Masco\u00efnat'' and the ''Pont-vieux'' (old bridge)\n\n====Cours Saleya====\n[[File:Saleya nice.jpg|thumb|Saleya Course (2007)]]\nThe Cours Saleya is situated parallel to the ''Quai des \u00c9tats-Unis''. In the past, it belonged to the upper classes. It is probably the most traditional square of the town, with its daily flower market. The ''Cours Saleya'' also opens on the ''Palais des Rois Sardes'' (Palace of the Kings of Sardinia). In the present, the ''court'' is mostly a place of entertainment.\n\n====Place du Palais====\n[[File:NIKAIA-palaisN5.jpg|thumb|Place du Palais view of the Rusca palace]]\nAs its name indicates, the ''Place du Palais'' is where the ''Palais de la Justice'' (Law courts) of Nice is located. On this square, there also is the ''Palais Rusca'', which also belongs to the justice department (home of the ''tribunal de grande instance'').\n\nThe square is also notable due to the presence of the city clock. Today, the ''Place du Palais'' is alive day and night. Often, groups of youths will hangout on the steps leading to the ''Palais de la Justice''. Concerts, films, and other major public events frequently occur in this space.\n\nIt is situated halfway between the ''Cours Saleya'' and ''Place Mass\u00e9na''.\n\n===Religious===\n[[File:2006.09.30 St Martin-kirken bak Colline du Chateau.JPG|thumb|The Church of St. Martin in Nice]]\n* [[Nice Cathedral|Sainte-R\u00e9parate Cathedral]], 17th century\n* [[Russian Orthodox Cathedral, Nice|Russian Orthodox Cathedral]]\n* [[Notre-Dame de Nice]]\n* [[Sainte Jeanne d'Arc Church (Nice, France)|Sainte Jeanne d'Arc Church]], 20th century\n\n===Sports and entertainment===\n* [[Stade du Ray]] (demolished) \n* [[Allianz Riviera]]\n* [[Stade Charles-Ehrmann]]\n* [[Palais Nikaia]]\n* [[Nice Jazz Festival]]\n\n==Sport==\n* The city's major [[association football|football]] club is [[OGC Nice]].

The observatory was established in 1879 by the banker [[Rapha\u00ebl Bischoffsheim]]. The architect was [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]]; [[Gustave Eiffel]] designed the main dome.\n\nThe 76-cm (30-inch) [[refractor telescope]] that became operational in 1888 was at that time the world's largest telescope.\n\n==Culture==\nTerra-Amata, an archaeological site dating from the [[Lower Palaeolithic]] age, is situated near Nice. Nice itself was established by the ancient [[Greeks]]. There was also an independent [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] city, Cemenelum, near Nice, where the hill of Cimiez is located. It is an archaeological site with treasures, of which only a small part has been excavated. The excavated site includes thermal baths, arenas and Roman road.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nSince the 2nd century AD, the light of the city has attracted painters and sculptors such as [[Chagall]], [[Matisse]], [[Niki de Saint Phalle]], [[Yves Klein|Klein]], [[Arman]] and [[Sacha Sosno|Sosno]]. Nice inspired many composers and intellectuals in different countries e.g. [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]],  [[Rossini]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], etc.\n\nNice also has numerous museums of all kinds: [[Mus\u00e9e Marc Chagall]], [[Mus\u00e9e Matisse (Nice)|Mus\u00e9e Matisse]] (arenas of Cimiez containing Roman ruins), [[Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Nice|Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts]], [[Mus\u00e9e international d'Art na\u00eff Anatole Jakovsky]], Mus\u00e9e Terra-Amata, Museum of Asian Art, [[Mus\u00e9e d'art moderne et d'art contemporain]] which devotes much space to the well-known '' \u00c9cole of Nice ''\u201d), Museum of Natural History, Mus\u00e9e Mass\u00e9na, Naval Museum and ''Galerie des Ponchettes''.\n\nBeing a vacation resort, Nice hosts many festivals throughout the year, such as the [[Nice Carnival]] and the [[Nice Jazz Festival]].\n\nNice has a distinct culture due to its unique history. The local language ''[[Ni\u00e7ard]] (Nissart)'' is an [[Occitan]] dialect (but some Italian scholars argue that it is a [[Ligurian language (Romance)|Ligurian]] dialect).{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} It is still spoken by a substantial minority {{citation needed|date=October 2019}}. Strong [[Italian culture|Italian]] and (to a lesser extent) [[Corsica]]n influences make it more intelligible to speakers of Italian than to other extant Proven\u00e7al dialects.\n\nIn the past, Nice welcomed many immigrants from [[Italy]] (who continue to make up a large proportion of the population), as well as Spanish and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] immigrants. However, in the past few decades immigration has been opened to include immigrants from all over the world, particularly those from former Northern and Western African colonies, as well as southeast Asia{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}. Traditions are still alive, especially in [[folk music]] and dances, including the [[farandole]] \u2013 an open-chain community dance.\n\nSince 1860 a cannon (based at the Ch\u00e2teau east of Old Nice) is shot at twelve o'clock sharp. The detonation can be heard almost all over the city. This tradition goes back to Sir Thomas Coventry, who intended to remind the citizens of having lunch on time.<ref>[https://archive.today/20130411000725/http://www.francemonthly.com/nice-french-riviera/ Nice \u2013 French Riviera: Noon on the Dot] from ''francemonthly.com''. Retrieved 11 February 2013.</ref>\n\n===Cuisine===\nThe cuisine of Nice is especially close to those of [[Provence]] but also [[Liguria]] and [[Piedmont]] and uses local ingredients ([[olive oil]], [[anchovies]], fruit and vegetables) but also those from more remote regions, in particular from Northern Europe, because ships which came to pick up olive oil arrived full of food products, such as dried [[haddock]].\n\nNice has a few local dishes. There is a local tart made with onions and [[anchovies]] (or anchovy paste), named \"[[Pissaladi\u00e8re]]\". ''[[Socca]]'' is a type of pancake made from [[chickpea]] flour. ''[[Farcis ni\u00e7ois]]'' is a dish made from vegetables stuffed with a mixture of breadcrumbs, meat (generally sausage and ground beef), and herbs; and ''[[salade ni\u00e7oise]]'' is a tomato salad with green peppers of the \"Corne\" variety, baked eggs, tuna or anchovies, and olives.\n\nLocal meat comes from neighbouring valleys, such as the sheep of [[Sisteron]]. Local fish, such as mullets, bream, sea urchins, and anchovies (alevins) are used to a great extent, so much so that it has given birth to a proverb: \"fish are born in the sea and die in oil\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=What Caesar Did For My Salad: The Secret Meanings of our Favourite Dishes|last=Jack|first=Albert|publisher=Penguin

[[Nice C\u00f4te d'Azur Airport|Nice's airport]] serves as a gateway to the region.\n\nThe city is nicknamed ''Nice la Belle'' (''[[Nissa La Bella]]'' in [[Ni\u00e7ard]]), which means ''Nice the Beautiful'', which is also the title of the unofficial anthem of Nice, written by [[Menica Rondelly]] in 1912. The area of today's Nice contains [[Terra Amata (archaeological site)|Terra Amata]], an archaeological site which displays evidence of a very early use of fire 380,000 years ago.

Its strategic location and port significantly contributed to its maritime strength. For centuries it was a dominion of [[Duchy of Savoy|Savoy]], and was then part of France between 1792 and 1815, when it was returned to the [[Piedmont-Sardinia|Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]] until its re-annexation by France in 1860.\n\nThe natural environment of the Nice area and its mild Mediterranean climate came to the attention of the English upper classes in the second half of the 18th century, when an increasing number of aristocratic families took to spending their winters there. The city's main seaside promenade, the [[Promenade des Anglais]] (\"Walkway of the English\") owes its name to visitors to the resort.<ref>Alain Ruggiero, op. cit., p. 137</ref>\nThe clear air and soft light have particularly appealed to notable painters, such as [[Marc Chagall]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Niki de Saint Phalle]] and [[Arman]].

Pestilence appeared again in 1550 and 1580.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn 1600, Nice was briefly taken by the [[House of Guise|Duke of Guise]]. By opening the ports of the county to all nations, and proclaiming full freedom of trade (1626), the commerce of the city was given great stimulus, the noble families taking part in its mercantile enterprises.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nCaptured by [[Nicolas Catinat]] in 1691, Nice was restored to [[Savoy]] in 1696; but [[Siege of Nice (1705)|it was again besieged by the French in 1705]], and in the following year its [[citadel]] and [[Defensive wall|rampart]]s were demolished.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)]] once more gave the city back to the Duke of Savoy, who was on that same occasion recognised as King of Sicily. In the peaceful years which followed, the \"new town\" was built. From 1744 until the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)]] the French and Spaniards were again in possession. In 1775 the king, who in 1718 had swapped his sovereignty of Sicily for the Kingdom of Sardinia, destroyed all that remained of the ancient liberties of the [[Commune in France|commune]]. Conquered in 1792 by the armies of the [[First French Republic]], the County of Nice continued to be part of France until 1814; but after that date it reverted to the [[Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===French Nice===\nAfter the [[Treaty of Turin (1860)|Treaty of Turin]] was signed in 1860 between the [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Sardinian king]] and [[Napoleon III]], the County was again and definitively ceded to France as a territorial reward for French assistance in the [[Second Italian War of Independence]] against [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], which saw [[Lombardy]] united with [[Piedmont-Sardinia]]. The cession was ratified by a regional [[referendum]]: over 25,000 electors out of a total of 30,700 were in favour of the attachment to [[France]].<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|wstitle=Nice (France)|volume=19|pages=646\u2013647|inline=1}}</ref> Savoy was also transferred to the French crown by similar means. [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], born in Nice, opposed the cession to France, arguing that the ballot was rigged by the French. \nMany Italians from Nizza then moved to the Ligurian towns of [[Ventimiglia]], [[Bordighera]] and [[Ospedaletti]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.liberanissa.eu/archives/nizza_e_il_suo_futuro/index.html|title=Nizza e il suo futuro|publisher=Liber\u00e0 Nissa|language=Italian|access-date=26 December 2018}}</ref> giving rise to a local branch of the movement of the [[Italia irredenta|Italian irredentists]] which considered the re-acquisition of Nice to be one of their nationalist goals.\n\nIn 1900, the [[Trams in Nice|Tramway de Nice]] electrified its horse-drawn streetcars and spread its network to the entire ''d\u00e9partement'' from [[Menton]] to [[Cagnes-sur-Mer]]. By the 1930s more bus connections were added in the area.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} In the 1930s, Nice hosted international car racing in the [[Formula Libre]] (predecessor to [[Formula One]]) on the so-called Circuit Nice. The circuit started along the waterfront just south of the Jardin Albert I, then headed westward along the [[Promenade des Anglais]] followed by a hairpin turn at the [[Hotel Negresco]] to come back eastward and around the Jardin Albert I before heading again east along the beach on the Quai des Etats-Unis.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bestofniceblog.com/history-nice-france/nice-grand-prix/|title=Nice Grand Prix|access-date=25 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nAs war broke out in September 1939, Nice became a city of refuge for many displaced foreigners, notably Jews fleeing the Nazi progression into Eastern Europe. From Nice many sought further shelter in the [[French colonial empire|French colonies]], Morocco and North and South America. After July 1940 and the establishment of the [[Vichy France|Vichy Regime]], [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] aggressions accelerated the exodus, starting in July 1941 and continuing through 1942. On 26 August 1942, 655 Jews of foreign origin were rounded up by the Laval government and interned in the Auvare barracks. Of these, 560 were deported to [[Drancy internment camp]] on 31 August 1942. Due to the activity of the Jewish banker [[Angelo Donati]] and of the Capuchin friar [[P\u00e8re Marie-Beno\u00eet]] the local authorities hindered the application of anti-Jewish Vichy laws.<ref>L\u00e9on Poliakov, ''La conditions des Juifs sous l'occupation italienne'', Paris, CDJC, 1946 and bibliographies of [[Angelo Donati]] and [[P\u00e8re Marie-Beno\u00eet]]</ref>\n\nThe first [[French Resistance|''r\u00e9sistants'']] to the new regime were a group of High School seniors of the Lyc\u00e9e de Nice, now {{ill|Lyc\u00e9e Mass\u00e9na|fr}}, in September 1940, later arrested and executed in 1944 near [[Verdon Gorge|Castellane]]. The first public demonstrations occurred on 14 July 1942 when several hundred protesters took to the streets along the Avenue de la Victoire and in the Place Mass\u00e9na. In November 1942 German troops moved into most of unoccupied France, but Italian troops moved into a smaller zone including Nice. A certain ambivalence remained among the population, many of whom were recent immigrants of Italian ancestry. However, the resistance gained momentum after the Italian surrender in 1943 when the German army occupied the former Italian zone. Reprisals intensified between December 1943 and July 1944, when many partisans were tortured and executed by the local [[Gestapo]] and the [[Milice|French Milice]]. Nice was also heavily bombarded by American aircraft in preparation for the Allied [[Operation Dragoon|landing in Provence]] (1000 dead or wounded and more than 5600 people homeless) and famine ensued during summer 1944.\nAmerican paratroopers entered the city on 30 August 1944 and Nice was finally liberated.\nThe consequences of the war were heavy: the population decreased by 15% {{citation needed|date=November 2017}} and economic life was totally disrupted.\n[[File:Colline du chateau waterfall.jpg|thumb|The waterfall on the Colline du Ch\u00e2teau (Castle Hill)]]\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, Nice enjoyed an economic boom primarily driven by tourism and construction. Two men dominated this period: [[Jean M\u00e9decin]], [[Mayor (France)|mayor]] for 33 years from 1928 to 1943 and from 1947 to 1965, and his son [[Jacques M\u00e9decin|Jacques]], mayor for 24 years from 1966 to 1990. Under their leadership, there was extensive urban renewal, including many new constructions. These included the convention centre, theatres, new thoroughfares and expressways. The arrival of the [[Pied-Noir|Pieds-Noirs]], refugees from Algeria after 1962 independence, also gave the city a boost and somewhat changed the make-up of its population and traditional views. {{citation needed|date=November 2017}} By the late 1980s, rumors of political corruption in the city government surfaced; and eventually formal accusations against Jacques M\u00e9decin forced him to flee France in 1990. Later arrested in [[Uruguay]] in 1993, he was extradited back to France in 1994, convicted of several counts of corruption and associated crimes and sentenced to imprisonment.\n\nOn 16 October 1979, a [[landslide]] and an undersea slide caused two [[tsunami]]s that hit the western coast of Nice; these [[1979 Nice events|events]] killed between 8 and 23 people.\n\nIn February 2001, European leaders met in Nice to negotiate and sign what is now the [[Treaty of Nice]], amending the institutions of the European Union.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/irish-referendum-on-nice-treaty-doomed-to-fail-again-189539.html|title=Irish referendum on Nice Treaty 'doomed to fail again'|work=[[The Independent]]|date=23 May 2002|first=Shawn|last=Pogatchnik|accessdate=17 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, local Chief [[Prosecutor]] [[\u00c9ric de Montgolfier]] alleged that some judicial cases involving local personalities had been suspiciously derailed by the local judiciary, which he suspected of having unhealthy contacts through [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] lodges with the defendants.

[[Villefranche-sur-Mer]] sits on an enclosed bay, while the main expanse of the city lies between the old port city and the Aeroport de C\u00f4te d'Azur, across a gently curving bay. The city rises from the flat beach into gentle rising hills, then is bounded by surrounding mountains that represent the Southern and nearly the Western extent of the [[Ligurian Alps]] range.\n\n===Flora===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\nThe natural vegetation of Nice is typical for a Mediterranean landscape, with a heavy representation of broadleaf evergreen shrubs. Trees tend to be scattered but form dense forests in some areas. Large native tree species include evergreens such as [[Quercus ilex|holm oak]], [[stone pine]] and [[arbutus]]. Many introduced species grow in parks and gardens. [[Palm tree|Palm]]s, [[eucalyptus]] and [[citrus fruit]]s are among the trees which give Nice a subtropical appearance. But there are also species familiar to temperate areas around the world; examples include [[Horse-chestnut (tree)|horse chestnut]], [[Tilia|linden]] and even [[Norway spruce]].\n\n===Climate===\nNice has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Csa'') with characteristics of a [[warm-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] : ''Csb''), enjoying mild winters with moderate rainfall. It is one of the warmest Mediterranean climates for its latitude. Summers are warm to hot, dry, and sunny. Rainfall is rare in this season, and a typical July month only records one or two days with measurable rainfall. The temperature is typically above {{convert|26|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} but rarely above {{convert|32|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. The climate data is recorded from the airport, located just metres from the sea. Summer temperatures, therefore, are often higher in the city. The average maximum temperature in the warmest months of July and August is about {{convert|27|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. The highest recorded temperature  was {{convert|37.7|\u00b0C|1|abbr=on}} on 1 August 2006. Autumn generally starts sunny in September and becomes more cloudy and rainy towards October, while temperatures usually remain above {{convert|20|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} until November where days start to cool down to around {{convert|17|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nWinters are characterised by mild days ({{convert|11|to|17|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}}), cool nights ({{convert|4|to|9|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}}), and variable weather. Days can be either sunny and dry or damp and rainy. The average minimum temperature in January is around {{convert|5|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. Frost is unusual and snowfalls are rare. The most recent snowfall in Nice was on 26 February 2018.<ref>\"[https://www.thelocal.fr/20180226/in-pictures-french-riviera-in-the-snow French Riviera hit by snowfall]\". ''The Local fr''.

tourism==\n[[File:NiceVieuxCartier.JPG|thumb|View of the old town]]\nNice is the seat of the [[Chambre de commerce et d'industrie Nice C\u00f4te d'Azur]], which manages the Port of Nice. Investors from France and abroad can benefit from the assistance of the C\u00f4te d'Azur Economic Development Agency [[Team C\u00f4te d'Azur]].\n\nNice has one conference centre: the [[Palais des Congr\u00e8s Acropolis]]. The city also has several business parks, including [[Districts of businesses Ni\u00e7oise L' Arenas|l'Arenas]], [[Districts of Ni\u00e7oise Nice businesses Plaine|Nice the Plain]], [[Districts of businesses Ni\u00e7oise Nice M\u00e9ridia|Nice M\u00e9ridia]], [[Districts of businesses Ni\u00e7oise Saint Isidore|Saint Isidore]], and the Northern Forum.\n\nIn addition, the city features several shopping centres such as Nicetoile, Nice TNL, Nice Lingosti\u00e8re, Northern Forum, St-Isidore, the Trinity (around the [[Auchan]] [[hypermarket]]), Cap3000 in [[Saint-Laurent-du-Var]] and [[Polygone Riviera]] in [[Cagnes-sur-Mer]].\n\n[[Sophia Antipolis]] is a technology park northwest of [[Antibes]]. Much of the park is within the commune of [[Valbonne]]. Established between 1970 and 1984, it primarily houses companies in the fields of computing, electronics, pharmacology and biotechnology. Several institutions of higher learning are also located here, along with the European headquarters of W3C.\n\nThe Nice metropolitan area had a [[List of cities by GDP|GDP amounting to $47.7 billion]], and $34,480 per capita,<ref name=\"Brookings\">{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/interactives/global-metro-monitor-3|title=Global city GDP 2011|publisher=Brookings Institution|accessdate=4 March 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605135349/http://www.brookings.edu/research/interactives/global-metro-monitor-3|archivedate=5 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> slightly lower than the French average.\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Port===\n[[File:Hafen von Nizza.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Port of Nice]]\nThe main port of Nice is also known as Lympia port. This name comes from the Lympia spring which fed a small lake in a marshy zone where work on the port was started in 1745. {{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} Today this is the principal harbour installation of Nice \u2013 there is also a small port in the Carras district. The port is the first port cement manufacturer in France, linked to the treatment plants of the rollers of the valley of Paillon. Fishing activities remain but the number of professional fishermen is now less than 10. {{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} Nice, being the point of continental France nearest to [[Corsica]], has ferry connections with the island developed with the arrival of NGV (''navires \u00e0 grande vitesse'') or [[high-speed craft]]. The connections are provided by [[Corsica Ferries - Sardinia Ferries]]. Located in front of the port, the Place Cassini has been renamed Place of Corsica.\n\n===Airport===\n\n[[Nice C\u00f4te d'Azur Airport]] is the third busiest airport in France after [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]] and [[Orly Airport]], both near Paris. It is on the [[Promenade des Anglais]], near l'Ar\u00e9nas and has two [[Airport terminal|terminals]]. Due to its proximity to the Principality of [[Monaco]], it also serves as that city\u2013state's airport. A helicopter service provided by [[Heli Air Monaco]] and [[Monacair]] links the city and airport. It is run by the ACA (A\u00e9roports C\u00f4te d'Azur), which includes [[Cannes - Mandelieu Airport]] and [[La M\u00f4le \u2013 Saint-Tropez Airport]]. Public transportation into the city proper is serviced by the [[Nice tramway|Tramway]] line 2 (T2).\n\n===Rail===\n\nThe main railway station is [[Gare de Nice-Ville|Nice-Ville]], served both by high speed [[TGV]] trains connecting Paris and Nice in less than 6 hours and by local commuter [[TER Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te-d'Azur|TER]] services. [[Gare de Marseille-Saint-Charles|Marseille]] is reached in 2.5 hours. Nice also has international connections to Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, and Russia.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11400917|title=French Riviera train for Russia|work=BBC News  |date=23 September 2010|accessdate=24 September 2010}}</ref> Nice is also served by several suburban stations including [[Gare de Nice-Saint-Augustin|Nice St-Augustin]], Nice St-Roch and [[Gare de Nice-Riquier|Nice Riquier]].\n\nNice is also the southern terminus of the independently run [[Chemins de Fer de Provence]] railway line which connects the city with [[Digne]] in approximatively 4 hours. A metro-like suburban service is also provided on the southern part of the line.\n\n===Tram===\n[[Trams in Nice|Tramway de Nice]] began operating horse-drawn trams in 1879. Electrified in 1900, the combined length of the network reached {{convert|144|km|2|abbr=on}} by 1930. The replacement of trams with [[trolleybus]]es began in 1948 and was completed in 1953.\n\nIn 2007, the new [[Nice tramway|Tramway de Nice]] linked the northern and eastern suburbs via the city centre. Two other lines are currently under construction and partly operating. The second line runs east-west from [[Avenue Jean M\u00e9decin|Jean M\u00e9decin]] to the [[Nice C\u00f4te d'Azur Airport]] (and will reach the Port at the end of 2019), while the third line will provide a connection to the future TGV Nice Saint-Augustin and to Lingosti\u00e8re railway station.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tramway.nice.fr/La-ligne-1/Dates-et-chiffres-cles |title=Dates et chiffres cl\u00e9s / La ligne 1 / Accueil \u2013 Tramway de la Communaut\u00e9 Urbaine Nice C\u00f4te d'Azur |language=fr |publisher=Tramway.nice.fr |date= |accessdate=15 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906064924/http://tramway.nice.fr/La-ligne-1/Dates-et-chiffres-cles |archivedate=6 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> A fourth line is set to run from the future TGV Nice Saint-Augustin to [[Cagnes-sur-Mer]].\n\n===Road===\n\nThe [[A8 autoroute]] and the [[Route nationale 7]] pass through the Nice agglomeration.\n\n==Sights==\n{{wide image|Nice Panorama Beachfront Cropped.jpg|900px|alt=|align-cap=center|Panorama of the town (including many main sights, like Hotel Negresco) and the beach}}\n{{wide image|Nice from Castle Hill 01.jpg|900px|alt=|align-cap=center|Panorama of Nice from Colline du Ch\u00e2teau}}\n[[File:Hotel Negresco (2).JPG|thumb|[[Hotel Negresco]]]]\n[[File:Nice-seafront.jpg|thumb|Seafront of the city]]\nThe [[Promenade des Anglais]] (\"Promenade of the English\") is a promenade along the Baie des Anges (\"Bay of the Angels\"), which is a bay of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], in Nice. Before Nice was urbanised, the coastline at Nice was just bordered by a deserted stretch of [[shingle beach]] (covered with large pebbles). The first houses were located on higher ground well away from the sea, as wealthy tourists visiting Nice in the 18th century did not come for the beach, but for the gentle winter weather. {{citation needed|date=January 2018}} The areas close to the water were home to Nice's dockworkers and fishermen.\n\nIn the second half of the 18th century, many wealthy English people took to spending the winter in Nice, enjoying the panorama along the coast. When a particularly harsh winter up north brought an influx of beggars to Nice, some of the rich Englishmen proposed a useful project for them: the construction of a walkway (''chemin de promenade'') along the sea. {{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe city of Nice, intrigued by the prospect of a pleasant promenade, greatly increased the scope of the work. The Promenade was first called the ''Camin dei Angl\u00e8s'' (the English Way) by the Ni\u00e7ois in their native dialect, [[Ni\u00e7ard|Nissart]]. After the annexation of Nice by France in 1860 it was rechristened ''La Promenade des Anglais'', replacing the former Nissart name with its French translation. {{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe [[Hotel Negresco]] on the Promenade des Anglais was named after [[Henri Negresco]] (1868\u20131920) who had the palatial hotel constructed in 1912. In keeping with the conventions of the time, when the Negresco first opened in 1913 its front opened on the side opposite the Mediterranean. {{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nAnother place worth mentioning is the small street parallel to the Promenade des Anglais, leading from Nice's downtown, beginning at Place Mass\u00e9na and running parallel to the promenade in the direction of the airport for a short distance of about 4 blocks. This section of the city is referred to as the \"Zone Pietonne\", or \"Pedestrian Zone\". Cars are not allowed (with exception to delivery trucks), making this avenue a popular walkway.\n\nOld Nice is also home to the [[Op\u00e9ra de Nice]]. It was constructed at the end of the 19th century under the design of Fran\u00e7ois Aune, to replace King Charles F\u00e9lix's Maccarani Theater. Today, it is open to the public and provides a regular program of performances.\n\nOther sights include:\n* [[Castle of Nice|Ch\u00e2teau]]\n* ''Monument aux morts''\n* The port\n* ''Cours Saleya''\n* ''[[Jardin botanique de la Ville de Nice]]'' (botanical garden)\n* '' Musee Massena''\n* ''March\u00e9 aux fleurs''\n* Old Nice\n* ''Grand H\u00f4tel Imp\u00e9rial''\n* Fort of Mont Alban\n\n===Squares===\n\n====Place Mass\u00e9na====\n[[File:Placemassena1.JPG|thumb|View of the Place Mass\u00e9na]]\n[[File:Place Massena by night.jpg|thumb|Place Mass\u00e9na by night, 2012]]\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}\nThe ''Place Mass\u00e9na'' is the main square of the city. Before the [[Paillon]] River was covered over, the Pont-Neuf was the only practicable way between the old town and the modern one. The square was thus divided into two parts (North and South) in 1824. With the demolition of the Mass\u00e9na Casino in 1979, the Place Mass\u00e9na became more spacious and less dense and is now bordered by red ochre buildings of [[Italian architecture]].\n\nThe recent rebuilding of the tramline gave the square back to the pedestrians, restoring its status as a real Mediterranean square. It is lined with palm trees and stone pines, instead of being the rectangular roundabout of sorts it had become over the years. Since its construction, the Place Mass\u00e9na has always been the spot for great public events. It is used for concerts, and particularly during the summer festivals, the ''[[Nice Carnival|Corso carnavalesque]]'' (carnival parade) in February, the military procession of 14 July (Bastille Day) or other traditional celebrations and banquets.\n\nThe Place Mass\u00e9na is a two-minute walk from the [[Promenade des Anglais]], old town, town centre, and Albert I Garden (''Jardin Albert Ier''). It is also a large crossroads between several of the main streets of the city: [[avenue Jean M\u00e9decin]], ''avenue F\u00e9lix Faure'', ''boulevard Jean Jaur\u00e8s'', ''avenue de Verdun'' and ''rue Gioffredo''.\n\n====Place Garibaldi====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}\n[[File:Nice Place Garibaldi 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Garibaldi's monument, Place Garibaldi]]\nThe ''Place Garibaldi'' also stands out for its architecture and history. It is named after [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], hero of the [[Italian unification]] (born in Nice in 1807 when Nice was part of the Napoleonic Empire, before reverting to the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia). The square was built at the end of the 18th century and served as the entry gate to the city and end of the road to Turin. It took several names between 1780 and 1870 (Pla\u00e7a Pairouli\u00e8ra, Place de la R\u00e9publique, Place Napol\u00e9on, Place d'Armes, Place Saint-Augustin, Piazza Vittorio) and finally Place Garibaldi in September 1870.\n\nA statue of Garibaldi, who was fiercely in favour of the union of Nice with Italy, stands in the centre of the square. The recent rebuilding of the area to accommodate the new tramway line gave mostly the entire square to pedestrians. The architecture is in line with the Turin model, which was the norm of urban renewal throughout the entire realm of the House of Savoy.\n[[File:Nice tramway place Garibaldi.jpg|thumb|left|Place Garibaldi, pedestrian since the introduction of the Nice tramway.]]\n\nIt is a crossroads between the ''Vieux Nice'' (old town) and the town centre. Place Garibaldi is close to the eastern districts of Nice, ''Port Lympia'' (Lympia Harbour), and the TNL commercial centre. This square is also a junction of several important streets: the ''boulevard Jean-Jaur\u00e8s'', the ''avenue de la R\u00e9publique'', the ''rue Cassini'' and the ''rue Catherine-S\u00e9gurane''.\n\n====Place Rossetti====\n[[File:Cath\u00e9drale Sainte R\u00e9parate in Nice.jpg|thumb|The Cathedral]]\nEntirely enclosed and pedestrianised, this square is located in the heart of the old town. With typical buildings in red and yellow ochres surrounding the square, the ''cath\u00e9drale Sainte-R\u00e9parate'' and the fountain in the centre, ''place Rossetti'' is a must-see spot in the old town. By day, the place is invaded by the terraces of traditional restaurants and the finest ice-cream makers. By night, the environment changes radically, with tourists and youths flocking to the square, where music reverberates on the walls of the small square. The square's lighting at night gives it a magical aspect.\n\nPlace Rossetti is in the centre of the old town, streets ''Jesus'', ''Rossetti'', ''Masco\u00efnat'' and the ''Pont-vieux'' (old bridge)\n\n====Cours Saleya====\n[[File:Saleya nice.jpg|thumb|Saleya Course (2007)]]\nThe Cours Saleya is situated parallel to the ''Quai des \u00c9tats-Unis''. In the past, it belonged to the upper classes. It is probably the most traditional square of the town, with its daily flower market. The ''Cours Saleya'' also opens on the ''Palais des Rois Sardes'' (Palace of the Kings of Sardinia). In the present, the ''court'' is mostly a place of entertainment.\n\n====Place du Palais====\n[[File:NIKAIA-palaisN5.jpg|thumb|Place du Palais view of the Rusca palace]]\nAs its name indicates, the ''Place du Palais'' is where the ''Palais de la Justice'' (Law courts) of Nice is located. On this square, there also is the ''Palais Rusca'', which also belongs to the justice department (home of the ''tribunal de grande instance'').\n\nThe square is also notable due to the presence of the city clock. Today, the ''Place du Palais'' is alive day and night. Often, groups of youths will hangout on the steps leading to the ''Palais de la Justice''. Concerts, films, and other major public events frequently occur in this space.\n\nIt is situated halfway between the ''Cours Saleya'' and ''Place Mass\u00e9na''.\n\n===Religious===\n[[File:2006.09.30 St Martin-kirken bak Colline du Chateau.JPG|thumb|The Church of St. Martin in Nice]]\n* [[Nice Cathedral|Sainte-R\u00e9parate Cathedral]], 17th century\n* [[Russian Orthodox Cathedral, Nice|Russian Orthodox Cathedral]]\n* [[Notre-Dame de Nice]]\n* [[Sainte Jeanne d'Arc Church (Nice, France)|Sainte Jeanne d'Arc Church]], 20th century\n\n===Sports and entertainment===\n* [[Stade du Ray]] (demolished) \n* [[Allianz Riviera]]\n* [[Stade Charles-Ehrmann]]\n* [[Palais Nikaia]]\n* [[Nice Jazz Festival]]\n\n==Sport==\n* The city's major [[association football|football]] club is [[OGC Nice]]. They play in [[Ligue 1]] (the top division in France).\n* The [[Olympic Nice]] swimming club ({{lang-fr|Olympic Nice Natation}}) is also notable; [[Camille Muffat]] and [[Yannick Agnel]] used to train there for example.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympicnice.com/|title=Olympic Nice Natation homepage|publisher=Olympic Nice Natation|language=French}}</ref>\n* Nice hosts the finish of the annual [[bicycle road racing|cycling race]] [[Paris\u2013Nice]].\n* The Nice Hockey \u00c9lite club play in [[Ligue Magnus]], the top men's division of the French ice hockey pyramid.\n* The [[Stade Ni\u00e7ois]] is an rugby club playing in [[F\u00e9d\u00e9rale 1]].\n\n==Population==\n{{Update section|date=January 2017}}\n{{Table Population Town}}\nThe metropolitan area of Nice, defined by INSEE, is home to 888,784 inhabitants (fifth most populous in France) and its urban area totals 933,080 inhabitants, which makes it the sixth largest in France.\n\n[[File:Nice vietnamese restaurant 3630.JPG|thumb|Nice residents of [[Vietnam]]ese descent stand in front of one of the many Vietnamese restaurants of the city.]]\n\nSince the 1970s, the number of inhabitants has not changed significantly; the relatively high migration to Nice is balanced by a natural negative growth of the population.\n\n==Observatory==\n[[File:Coupole Bischoffsheim.jpg|thumb|View of the Bischoffsheim cupola, the main cupola of [[Nice Observatory]]]]\nThe ''Observatoire de Nice'' ([[Nice Observatory]]) is located on the summit of Mont Gros. The observatory was established in 1879 by the banker [[Rapha\u00ebl Bischoffsheim]]. The architect was [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]]; [[Gustave Eiffel]] designed the main dome.\n\nThe 76-cm (30-inch) [[refractor telescope]] that became operational in 1888 was at that time the world's largest telescope.\n\n==Culture==\nTerra-Amata, an archaeological site dating from the [[Lower Palaeolithic]] age, is situated near Nice. Nice itself was established by the ancient [[Greeks]]. There was also an independent [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] city, Cemenelum, near Nice, where the hill of Cimiez is located. It is an archaeological site with treasures, of which only a small part has been excavated. The excavated site includes thermal baths, arenas and Roman road.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nSince the 2nd century AD, the light of the city has attracted painters and sculptors such as [[Chagall]], [[Matisse]], [[Niki de Saint Phalle]], [[Yves Klein|Klein]], [[Arman]] and [[Sacha Sosno|Sosno]]. Nice inspired many composers and intellectuals in different countries e.g. [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]],  [[Rossini]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], etc.\n\nNice also has numerous museums of all kinds: [[Mus\u00e9e Marc Chagall]], [[Mus\u00e9e Matisse (Nice)|Mus\u00e9e Matisse]] (arenas of Cimiez containing Roman ruins), [[Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Nice|Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts]], [[Mus\u00e9e international d'Art na\u00eff Anatole Jakovsky]], Mus\u00e9e Terra-Amata, Museum of Asian Art, [[Mus\u00e9e d'art moderne et d'art contemporain]] which devotes much space to the well-known '' \u00c9cole of Nice ''\u201d), Museum of Natural History, Mus\u00e9e Mass\u00e9na, Naval Museum and ''Galerie des Ponchettes''.\n\nBeing a vacation resort, Nice hosts many festivals throughout the year, such as the [[Nice Carnival]] and the [[Nice Jazz Festival]].\n\nNice has a distinct culture due to its unique history. The local language ''[[Ni\u00e7ard]] (Nissart)'' is an [[Occitan]] dialect (but some Italian scholars argue that it is a [[Ligurian language (Romance)|Ligurian]] dialect).{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} It is still spoken by a substantial minority {{citation needed|date=October 2019}}. Strong [[Italian culture|Italian]] and (to a lesser extent) [[Corsica]]n influences make it more intelligible to speakers of Italian than to other extant Proven\u00e7al dialects.\n\nIn the past, Nice welcomed many immigrants from [[Italy]] (who continue to make up a large proportion of the population), as well as Spanish and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] immigrants. However, in the past few decades immigration has been opened to include immigrants from all over the world, particularly those from former Northern and Western African colonies, as well as southeast Asia{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}. Traditions are still alive, especially in [[folk music]] and dances, including the [[farandole]] \u2013 an open-chain community dance.\n\nSince 1860 a cannon (based at the Ch\u00e2teau east of Old Nice) is shot at twelve o'clock sharp. The detonation can be heard almost all over the city. This tradition goes back to Sir Thomas Coventry, who intended to remind the citizens of having lunch on time.<ref>[https://archive.today/20130411000725/http://www.francemonthly.com/nice-french-riviera/ Nice \u2013 French Riviera: Noon on the Dot] from ''francemonthly.com''. Retrieved 11 February 2013.</ref>\n\n===Cuisine===\nThe cuisine of Nice is especially close to those of [[Provence]] but also [[Liguria]] and [[Piedmont]] and uses local ingredients ([[olive oil]], [[anchovies]], fruit and vegetables) but also those from more remote regions, in particular from Northern Europe, because ships which came to pick up olive oil arrived full of food products, such as dried [[haddock]].\n\nNice has a few local dishes. There is a local tart made with onions and [[anchovies]] (or anchovy paste), named \"[[Pissaladi\u00e8re]]\". ''[[Socca]]'' is a type of pancake made from [[chickpea]] flour. ''[[Farcis ni\u00e7ois]]'' is a dish made from vegetables stuffed with a mixture of breadcrumbs, meat (generally sausage and ground beef), and herbs; and ''[[salade ni\u00e7oise]]'' is a tomato salad with green peppers of the \"Corne\" variety, baked eggs, tuna or anchovies, and olives.\n\nLocal meat comes from neighbouring valleys, such as the sheep of [[Sisteron]]. Local fish, such as mullets, bream, sea urchins, and anchovies (alevins) are used to a great extent, so much so that it has given birth to a proverb: \"fish are born in the sea and die in oil\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=What Caesar Did For My Salad: The Secret Meanings of our Favourite Dishes|last=Jack|first=Albert|publisher=Penguin

While many psychiatric diagnoses are believed to be associated with traumatic experiences occurring during critical periods of childhood, specific neurobiological factors have been identified within patients diagnosed with BPD. Dysregulations of the [[Hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis|hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis]] and [[cortisol]] levels have been intensively studied in individuals who have experienced childhood traumas and have been formally diagnosed with BPD. The HPA axis functions to maintain homeostasis when the body is exposed to stressors but has been found to be dysregulated among individuals with a history of childhood abuse. When the body is exposed to stress, the [[hypothalamus]], specifically the [[Paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus|paraventricular nucleus]] (PVN) releases peptides [[Vasopressin|arginine vasopressin]] (AVP) and [[Corticotropin-releasing factor family|corticotropin-releasing factor]] (CRF). When these peptides travel through the body, they stimulate [[corticotrophic]] cells, resulting in the release of [[Adrenocorticotropic hormone|adrenocorticotropic]] hormone (ACTH).

Twice as many women as men in the community suffer from depression (Weissman & Klerman, 1985). In contrast, there is a preponderance of men meeting criteria for substance abuse and psychopathy (Robins & Regier, 1991), and males with these disorders do not necessarily present in the mental health system. Men and women with similar psychological problems may express distress differently. Men tend to drink more and carry out more crimes. Women tend to turn their anger on themselves, leading to depression as well as the cutting and overdosing that characterize BPD. Thus, [[anti-social personality disorder]] (ASPD) and borderline personality disorders might derive from similar underlying pathology but present with symptoms strongly influenced by gender (Paris, 1997a; Looper & Paris, 2000).\n\nWe have even more specific evidence that men with BPD may not seek help. In a study of completed suicides among people aged 18 to 35 years (Lesage et al., 1994), 30% of the suicides involved individuals with BPD (as confirmed by psychological autopsy, in which symptoms were assessed by interviews with family members). Most of the suicide completers were men, and very few were in treatment. Similar findings emerged from a later study conducted by our own research group (McGirr, Paris, Lesage, Renaud, & Turecki, 2007).<ref name=\"Paris J 2008 21\u201322\"/>}}\n\nIn short, men are less likely to seek or accept appropriate treatment, more likely to be treated for symptoms of BPD such as substance abuse rather than BPD itself (the symptoms of BPD and ASPD possibly deriving from a similar underlying aetiology), possibly more likely to wind up in the correctional system due to criminal behavior, and possibly more likely to commit suicide prior to diagnosis.\n\nAmong men diagnosed with BPD there is also evidence of a higher suicide rate: \"men are more than twice as likely as women\u201418 percent versus 8 percent\"\u2014to die by suicide.<ref name=\"Kreisman J, Strauss H 2004 206\"/>\n\nThere are also sex differences in borderline personality disorders.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sansone RA, Sansone LA | title = Gender patterns in borderline personality disorder | journal = Innovations in Clinical Neuroscience | volume = 8 | issue = 5 | pages = 16\u201320 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21686143 | pmc = 3115767 }}</ref> Men with BPD are more likely to abuse substances, have explosive temper, high levels of novelty seeking and have [[Antisocial personality disorder|anti-social]], [[Narcissism|narcissistic]], passive-aggressive or sadistic personality traits.<ref name=\":0\" /> Women with BPD are more likely to have eating disorders, mood disorders, anxiety and post-traumatic stress.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Manipulative behavior===\n[[Psychological manipulation|Manipulative behavior]] to obtain nurturance is considered by the [[diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders|DSM-IV-TR]] and many mental health professionals to be a defining characteristic of borderline personality disorder.<ref>{{harvnb|American Psychiatric Association|2000|page=705}}</ref> However, [[Marsha Linehan]] notes that doing so relies upon the assumption that people with BPD who communicate intense pain, or who engage in self-harm and suicidal behavior, do so with the intention of influencing the behavior of others.<ref name = Linehanp14>{{harvnb|Linehan|1993|page=14}}</ref> The impact of such behavior on others\u2014often an intense emotional reaction in concerned friends, family members, and therapists\u2014is thus assumed to have been the person's intention.<ref name = Linehanp14/>\n\nHowever, their frequent expressions of intense pain, self-harming, or suicidal behavior may instead represent a method of mood regulation or an escape mechanism from situations that feel unbearable.<ref>{{harvnb|Linehan|1993|page=15}}</ref>\n\n===Stigma===\nThe features of BPD include emotional instability; intense, unstable interpersonal relationships; a need for intimacy; and a fear of rejection.

While many psychiatric diagnoses are believed to be associated with traumatic experiences occurring during critical periods of childhood, specific neurobiological factors have been identified within patients diagnosed with BPD. Dysregulations of the [[Hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis|hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis]] and [[cortisol]] levels have been intensively studied in individuals who have experienced childhood traumas and have been formally diagnosed with BPD. The HPA axis functions to maintain homeostasis when the body is exposed to stressors but has been found to be dysregulated among individuals with a history of childhood abuse. When the body is exposed to stress, the [[hypothalamus]], specifically the [[Paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus|paraventricular nucleus]] (PVN) releases peptides [[Vasopressin|arginine vasopressin]] (AVP) and [[Corticotropin-releasing factor family|corticotropin-releasing factor]] (CRF). When these peptides travel through the body, they stimulate [[corticotrophic]] cells, resulting in the release of [[Adrenocorticotropic hormone|adrenocorticotropic]] hormone (ACTH).

Twice as many women as men in the community suffer from depression (Weissman & Klerman, 1985). In contrast, there is a preponderance of men meeting criteria for substance abuse and psychopathy (Robins & Regier, 1991), and males with these disorders do not necessarily present in the mental health system. Men and women with similar psychological problems may express distress differently. Men tend to drink more and carry out more crimes. Women tend to turn their anger on themselves, leading to depression as well as the cutting and overdosing that characterize BPD. Thus, [[anti-social personality disorder]] (ASPD) and borderline personality disorders might derive from similar underlying pathology but present with symptoms strongly influenced by gender (Paris, 1997a; Looper & Paris, 2000).\n\nWe have even more specific evidence that men with BPD may not seek help. In a study of completed suicides among people aged 18 to 35 years (Lesage et al., 1994), 30% of the suicides involved individuals with BPD (as confirmed by psychological autopsy, in which symptoms were assessed by interviews with family members). Most of the suicide completers were men, and very few were in treatment. Similar findings emerged from a later study conducted by our own research group (McGirr, Paris, Lesage, Renaud, & Turecki, 2007).<ref name=\"Paris J 2008 21\u201322\"/>}}\n\nIn short, men are less likely to seek or accept appropriate treatment, more likely to be treated for symptoms of BPD such as substance abuse rather than BPD itself (the symptoms of BPD and ASPD possibly deriving from a similar underlying aetiology), possibly more likely to wind up in the correctional system due to criminal behavior, and possibly more likely to commit suicide prior to diagnosis.\n\nAmong men diagnosed with BPD there is also evidence of a higher suicide rate: \"men are more than twice as likely as women\u201418 percent versus 8 percent\"\u2014to die by suicide.<ref name=\"Kreisman J, Strauss H 2004 206\"/>\n\nThere are also sex differences in borderline personality disorders.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sansone RA, Sansone LA | title = Gender patterns in borderline personality disorder | journal = Innovations in Clinical Neuroscience | volume = 8 | issue = 5 | pages = 16\u201320 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21686143 | pmc = 3115767 }}</ref> Men with BPD are more likely to abuse substances, have explosive temper, high levels of novelty seeking and have [[Antisocial personality disorder|anti-social]], [[Narcissism|narcissistic]], passive-aggressive or sadistic personality traits.<ref name=\":0\" /> Women with BPD are more likely to have eating disorders, mood disorders, anxiety and post-traumatic stress.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Manipulative behavior===\n[[Psychological manipulation|Manipulative behavior]] to obtain nurturance is considered by the [[diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders|DSM-IV-TR]] and many mental health professionals to be a defining characteristic of borderline personality disorder.<ref>{{harvnb|American Psychiatric Association|2000|page=705}}</ref> However, [[Marsha Linehan]] notes that doing so relies upon the assumption that people with BPD who communicate intense pain, or who engage in self-harm and suicidal behavior, do so with the intention of influencing the behavior of others.<ref name = Linehanp14>{{harvnb|Linehan|1993|page=14}}</ref> The impact of such behavior on others\u2014often an intense emotional reaction in concerned friends, family members, and therapists\u2014is thus assumed to have been the person's intention.<ref name = Linehanp14/>\n\nHowever, their frequent expressions of intense pain, self-harming, or suicidal behavior may instead represent a method of mood regulation or an escape mechanism from situations that feel unbearable.<ref>{{harvnb|Linehan|1993|page=15}}</ref>\n\n===Stigma===\nThe features of BPD include emotional instability; intense, unstable interpersonal relationships; a need for intimacy; and a fear of rejection.

On 5 February 1589 (26 January, J.C.) Job was elected the first [[Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia]].

Under Job's supervision, the [[Russians]] corrected books for the [[Canonical Hours|divine services]] and prepared them for publication.\n\nHe assisted in the [[Canonization|glorification]] (canonization) of some of the Russian [[saint]]s, ordering the celebration of the memory of [[Basil Fool for Christ]] in 1588, as well as that of [[Joseph Volotsky]] and others. Patriarch Job also favored the construction of new [[cathedral]]s and monasteries and [[Christianity|Christian]] [[missionary]] activities in the recently conquered [[Astrakhan Khanate]] and [[Siberia]]. He also corresponded with [[Catholicos Nicholas V of Georgia]] and exchanged gifts with him. After the mysterious death of [[tsarevich]] [[Tsarevich Dmitry Ivanovich of Russia (born 1582)|Dmitry Ivanovich]] in 1591, Job accepted the non-criminal version of his demise, supporting Boris Godunov every step of the way.\n\nIn 1591, he headed the official enquiry into the death of Tsarevich Dmitry in Uglich. After consulting with the church council and the duma of boyars, the patriarch announced his verdict \u2013 the tsarevich had accidentally stabbed himself and not been murdered. In that year he also founded the [[Donskoy Monastery]] in Moscow.\n\nAfter the death of [[Tsar]] [[Feodor I]] and the refusal of his wife, Irina Godunova, to accept the throne, Patriarch Job became the head of state in 1598. As he was much obliged to Boris Godunov for his promotion to the post of patriarch, Job offered his candidature as tsar to the Land Assembly (Zemsky sobor). On 21 February 1598, he headed a religious procession to Boris Godunov at the Novodevichy Convent, imploring him to accept the throne.\n\n==Downfall and death==\nJob was known as a harsh critic of False Dmitriy I and he tried to persuade the people of Moscow to remain loyal to the deceased [[tsar]]. The armed supporters of the [[impostor]] burst into the [[Cathedral of the Dormition]] and a [[boyar]] named P. F. Basmanov declared Job a traitor. Job's formal removal from office was on June 24, 1605, when the council announced the move sanctified him retired because of old age and ill health. The same council announced the grant the dignity of the Patriarch Ignatius. Job was sent into [[exile]] to his monastery in [[Staritsa (town), Tver Oblast|Staritsa]], where he went completely blind. Job was succeeded by Archbishop [[Ignatius of Moscow|Ignatius]] of [[Ryazan]] and only returned to Moscow following the murder of [[False Dmitry I]], the imprisonment of [[Ignatius of Moscow|Patriarch Ignatius]] at the Monastery of the Miracle and the accession of [[Vasili IV of Russia]]. On February 20, 1607, at the request of Tsar [[Vasili IV of Russia|Vasili Shuisky]], Patriarchs Hermogen and Job jointly celebrated the [[Holy Liturgy]] at the Dormition Cathedral in the [[Moscow Kremlin]], where he forgave the people of Moscow and gave them his blessing. He finally died a very sick man in 1607.\n\nIn 1652, Job's [[relic]]s were transferred to the [[Dormition Cathedral, Moscow|Cathedral of the Dormition]] of the [[Moscow Kremlin]], where they remain to this day.

He exercised all his influence and played a major part in Boris Godunov's ascending to the Russian throne.\n\n==Patriarchate==\n[[File:Geller jove.jpg|130px|thumb|''Patriarch Job refusing to recognize [[False Dmitry I]] as [[Ivan IV]]'s son'' (19th-century painting by Peter Geller).]]\nJob did not approve, however, of Godunov's proposal to open a [[university]] in Moscow staffed with foreign professors because he believed their influence and non-[[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] faith would spread [[heterodoxy]] and endanger the purity of the Russian Church. Under Job's supervision, the [[Russians]] corrected books for the [[Canonical Hours|divine services]] and prepared them for publication.\n\nHe assisted in the [[Canonization|glorification]] (canonization) of some of the Russian [[saint]]s, ordering the celebration of the memory of [[Basil Fool for Christ]] in 1588, as well as that of [[Joseph Volotsky]] and others. Patriarch Job also favored the construction of new [[cathedral]]s and monasteries and [[Christianity|Christian]] [[missionary]] activities in the recently conquered [[Astrakhan Khanate]] and [[Siberia]]. He also corresponded with [[Catholicos Nicholas V of Georgia]] and exchanged gifts with him. After the mysterious death of [[tsarevich]] [[Tsarevich Dmitry Ivanovich of Russia (born 1582)|Dmitry Ivanovich]] in 1591, Job accepted the non-criminal version of his demise, supporting Boris Godunov every step of the way.\n\nIn 1591, he headed the official enquiry into the death of Tsarevich Dmitry in Uglich. After consulting with the church council and the duma of boyars, the patriarch announced his verdict \u2013 the tsarevich had accidentally stabbed himself and not been murdered. In that year he also founded the [[Donskoy Monastery]] in Moscow.\n\nAfter the death of [[Tsar]] [[Feodor I]] and the refusal of his wife, Irina Godunova, to accept the throne, Patriarch Job became the head of state in 1598. As he was much obliged to Boris Godunov for his promotion to the post of patriarch, Job offered his candidature as tsar to the Land Assembly (Zemsky sobor). On 21 February 1598, he headed a religious procession to Boris Godunov at the Novodevichy Convent, imploring him to accept the throne.\n\n==Downfall and death==\nJob was known as a harsh critic of False Dmitriy I and he tried to persuade the people of Moscow to remain loyal to the deceased [[tsar]]. The armed supporters of the [[impostor]] burst into the [[Cathedral of the Dormition]] and a [[boyar]] named P. F. Basmanov declared Job a traitor. Job's formal removal from office was on June 24, 1605, when the council announced the move sanctified him retired because of old age and ill health. The same council announced the grant the dignity of the Patriarch Ignatius. Job was sent into [[exile]] to his monastery in [[Staritsa (town), Tver Oblast|Staritsa]], where he went completely blind. Job was succeeded by Archbishop [[Ignatius of Moscow|Ignatius]] of [[Ryazan]] and only returned to Moscow following the murder of [[False Dmitry I]], the imprisonment of [[Ignatius of Moscow|Patriarch Ignatius]] at the Monastery of the Miracle and the accession of [[Vasili IV of Russia]]. On February 20, 1607, at the request of Tsar [[Vasili IV of Russia|Vasili Shuisky]], Patriarchs Hermogen and Job jointly celebrated the [[Holy Liturgy]] at the Dormition Cathedral in the [[Moscow Kremlin]], where he forgave the people of Moscow and gave them his blessing. He finally died a very sick man in 1607.\n\nIn 1652, Job's [[relic]]s were transferred to the [[Dormition Cathedral, Moscow|Cathedral of the Dormition]] of the [[Moscow Kremlin]], where they remain to this day. Patriarch Job was [[canonisation|glorified]] as a [[saint]] by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] in 1989.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-rel|eo}}\n{{succession box\n| title = [[Patriarch of Moscow and all Russia]]\n| before = Office created\n| years = 1589\u20131605\n| after = [[Ignatius of Moscow|Ignatius]]\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2012}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Job of Moscow, Patriarch}}\n[[Category:Russian saints]]\n[[Category:Metropolitans and Patriarchs of Moscow]]\n[[Category:1607 deaths]]\n[[Category:Burials at Dormition Cathedral, Moscow]]\n[[Category:17th-century Christian saints]]\n[[Category:Year of birth unknown]]\n", "name_user": "BiRDiE16", "label": "safe", "comment": "A few articles on the Internet say he was born in 1525.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarch_Job_of_Moscow"}

Its first director was [[Yugoslav People's Army]] colonel Ivan Sert. The following directors of the company were engineers Miljenko Pje\u0161\u010di\u0107 and Tomislav Miri\u0107. The serial manufacture of numerous types of aircraft was projected by the [[Aeronautical Technical Institute]] in [[Belgrade]]. Besides aircraft, SOKO also produced helicopters under licence. Located in the vicinity of Mostar, it mostly used the [[Mostar Airport]] for test flights.\n\nBy the 1980s, SOKO was working on the [[Novi Avion]] project, intended to develop an indigenous fourth-generation, supersonic [[Multirole combat aircraft|multi-role fighter]] that would enabled the Yugoslav Air Force to be supplied with domestically-built modern fighters. The production was planned to begin around 1991; however, the outbreak of the [[Yugoslav wars]] and the enactment of an international [[arms embargo]] caused the project to be cancelled.<ref>[http://vazduhoplovnetradicijesrbije.rs/index.php/clanak/32-novi-avion Novi avion] at vazduhoplovnetradicijesrbije.rs, retrieved 4-12-2013 {{in lang|sr}}</ref>  During the early 1990s, the factory ceased aircraft production altogether.
