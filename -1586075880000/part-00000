In 1972, Suren Sehgal identified a small molecule, from a soil bacterium ''[[Streptomyces hygroscopicus]]'', that he purified and initially reported to possess potent antifungal activity. He appropriately named it rapamycin, noting its original source and activity (Sehgal et al., 1975). However, early testing revealed that rapamycin also had potent immunosuppressive and cytostatic anti-cancer activity. Unfortunately, rapamycin did not initially receive significant interest from the pharmaceutical industry until the 1980s, when Wyeth-Ayerst supported Sehgal's efforts to further investigate rapamycin's effect on the immune system. This eventually led to its FDA approval as an immunosuppressant following kidney transplantation. However, prior to its FDA approval, how rapamycin worked remained completely unknown.\n\nThe discovery of TOR and mTOR stemmed from independent studies of the natural product rapamycin by [[Joseph Heitman]], Rao Movva, and [[Michael N.

It is not surprising then that mTOR signaling is implicated in the entire hierarchy of brain function including the proliferation of neural stem cells, the assembly and maintenance of circuits, experience-dependent plasticity and regulation of complex behaviors like feeding, sleep and circadian rhythms.&nbsp;...<br />mTOR function is mediated through two large biochemical complexes defined by their respective protein composition and have been extensively reviewed elsewhere(Dibble and Manning, 2013; Laplante and Sabatini, 2012)(Figure 1B). In brief, common to both mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) are: mTOR itself, mammalian lethal with sec13 protein 8 (mLST8; also known as G\u03b2L), and the inhibitory DEP domain containing mTOR-interacting protein (DEPTOR). Specific to mTORC1 is the regulator-associated protein of the mammalian target of rapamycin (Raptor) and proline-rich Akt substrate of 40 kDa (PRAS40)(Kim et al., 2002; Laplante and Sabatini, 2012). Raptor is essential to mTORC1 activity. The mTORC2 complex includes the rapamycin insensitive companion of mTOR (Rictor), mammalian stress activated MAP kinase-interacting protein 1 (mSIN1), and proteins observed with rictor 1 and 2 (PROTOR 1 and 2)(Jacinto et al., 2006; Jacinto et al., 2004; Pearce et al., 2007; Sarbassov et al., 2004)(Figure 1B).

In 1972, Suren Sehgal identified a small molecule, from a soil bacterium ''[[Streptomyces hygroscopicus]]'', that he purified and initially reported to possess potent antifungal activity. He appropriately named it rapamycin, noting its original source and activity (Sehgal et al., 1975). However, early testing revealed that rapamycin also had potent immunosuppressive and cytostatic anti-cancer activity. Unfortunately, rapamycin did not initially receive significant interest from the pharmaceutical industry until the 1980s, when Wyeth-Ayerst supported Sehgal's efforts to further investigate rapamycin's effect on the immune system. This eventually led to its FDA approval as an immunosuppressant following kidney transplantation. However, prior to its FDA approval, how rapamycin worked remained completely unknown.\n\nThe discovery of TOR and mTOR stemmed from independent studies of the natural product rapamycin by [[Joseph Heitman]], Rao Movva, and [[Michael N. Hall]], and by [[Stuart Schreiber|Stuart L. Schreiber]], [[David M. Sabatini]], and Robert T.

Raptor is essential to mTORC1 activity. The mTORC2 complex includes the rapamycin insensitive companion of mTOR (Rictor), mammalian stress activated MAP kinase-interacting protein 1 (mSIN1), and proteins observed with rictor 1 and 2 (PROTOR 1 and 2)(Jacinto et al., 2006; Jacinto et al., 2004; Pearce et al., 2007; Sarbassov et al., 2004)(Figure 1B).

In 1912, the dispute over authority between supporters of the Metropolitan and supporters of the Patriarch finally divided the Malankara Church, with the former group becoming the essentially independent [[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]] headed by the [[Catholicos of the East]] and the latter maintaining ties with the Patriarch of Antioch as the [[Malankara Jacobite Syrian Christian Church]].

Abded Sattuf claimed the patriarchal throne by paying [[Ottoman lira|\u00a3]]500 to secure his election and was enthroned on August 15, 1906 as an exception that he was never been a [[Maphrian]] and left for London shortly after.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fortescue|first1=Adrian|title=The lesser eastern churches|date=1913|publisher=London : Catholic Truth Society|url=https://archive.org/stream/lessereasternchu00fortuoft#page/n361/mode/2up}}</ref>\n\nWhilst in London, Abded met with King [[Edward VII]] twice and received a medal. He travelled to India in 1908 and began ordaining Indian bishops much to the chagrin of the local church. This led to the demand of a [[Maphrian]] or [[Catholicos]] to prevent the [[Malankara Church]] coming under Abded's control. In 1910, Abded established the Knanaya (Autonomous) Archdiocese). In 1912, the dispute over authority between supporters of the Metropolitan and supporters of the Patriarch finally divided the Malankara Church, with the former group becoming the essentially independent [[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]] headed by the [[Catholicos of the East]] and the latter maintaining ties with the Patriarch of Antioch as the [[Malankara Jacobite Syrian Christian Church]]. Motions by the church leaders and two Supreme Court decisions in the 20th century failed to heal the rift.\n\nHe also travelled to Jerusalem in 1912.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soc-wus.org/patriarchate/Ignatius%20Abde%20d-Aloho%20II%20Sattuf.htm|title=\u0710\u0726\u071b\u072a\u0718\u0726\u0718\u072c\u0710 \u0726\u071b\u072a\u071d\u072a\u071f\u071d\u072c\u0710 |publisher=Soc-wus.org}}</ref>\n\nAbded resided at the Monastery of Mor Marqos from March 17, 1912 until his death on July 17, 1915, where he was also buried.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{Succession box|\nbefore=[[Ignatius Abded Mshiho II]]|\ntitle=[[List of Syriac Orthodox Patriarchs of Antioch|Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch]]|\nyears=1906\u20131915|\nafter=[[Ignatius Elias III]]}}\n{{S-end}}\n{{Patriarchs of the Syriac Orthodox Church}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Aloho II, Ignatius Abded}}\n[[Category:Syrian Oriental Orthodox Christians]]\n[[Category:Syriac Orthodox Patriarchs of Antioch]]\n[[Category:1833 births]]\n[[Category:1915 deaths]]\n[[Category:19th-century people of the Ottoman Empire]]\n[[Category:20th-century people of the Ottoman Empire]]\n[[Category:Syrian archbishops]]\n[[Category:20th-century Oriental Orthodox archbishops]]\n[[Category:19th-century Oriental Orthodox archbishops]]\n", "name_user": "123.208.195.6", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignatius_Abded_Aloho_II"}
