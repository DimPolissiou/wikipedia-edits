In the last Villanovan phase, called the recent phase (about 770\u2013730 BC), the Etruscans established relations of a certain consistency with the first [[Magna Grecia|Greek immigrants in southern Italy]] (in [[Ischia|Pithecusa]] and then in [[Cuma (Italy)|Cuma]]), so much so as to initially absorb techniques and figurative models and soon more properly cultural models, with the introduction, for example, of writing, of a new way of banqueting, of a heroic funerary ideology, that is, a new aristocratic way of life, such as to profoundly change the physiognomy of Etruscan society.<ref name=BartoloniTreccani/> Thus, thanks to the growing number of contacts with the Greeks, the Etruscans entered what is called the [[orientalizing period|Orientalizing phase]].

Some small towns in the sixth century&nbsp;BC disappeared during this time, ostensibly subsumed by greater, more powerful neighbours. However, it is certain that the political structure of the Etruscan culture was similar to, albeit more aristocratic than, [[Magna Graecia]] in the south. The mining and commerce of metal, especially [[copper]] and [[Iron (material)|iron]], led to an enrichment of the Etruscans and to the expansion of their influence in the Italian peninsula and the western [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Here, their interests collided with those of the Greeks, especially in the sixth century&nbsp;BC, when [[Phocaea]]ns of Italy founded colonies along the coast of [[Sardinia]], [[Spain]] and [[Corsica]]. This led the Etruscans to ally themselves with [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]], whose interests also collided with the Greeks.<ref name=\"historyone\">{{cite book|author=Larissa Bonfante |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4QaXZky58FIC&pg=PA58&dq=Etruscan+League#PPR5,M1 |title=Etruscan life and afterlife|via=Google Books | accessdate=2009-04-22 | isbn=978-0-8143-1813-3|year = 1986}}</ref><ref name=\"historytwo\">{{cite book |author=John Franklin Hall |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bUhT7i7XhOAC&pg=PA198&dq=Etruscan+League |title=Etruscan Italy |via=Google Books |accessdate=2009-04-22 |isbn=978-0-8425-2334-9 |df=dmy-all|year = 1996}}</ref>\n\nAround 540&nbsp;BC, the [[Battle of Alalia]] led to a new distribution of power in the western Mediterranean. Though the battle had no clear winner, [[Carthage]] managed to expand its sphere of influence at the expense of the Greeks, and Etruria saw itself relegated to the northern [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] with full ownership of [[Corsica]]. From the first half of the 5th&nbsp;century&nbsp;BC, the new political situation meant the beginning of the Etruscan decline after losing their southern provinces. In 480&nbsp;BC, Etruria's ally Carthage was defeated by a coalition of Magna Graecia cities led by [[Syracuse, Sicily]]. A few years later, in 474&nbsp;BC, Syracuse's tyrant [[Hiero I of Syracuse|Hiero]] defeated the Etruscans at the [[Battle of Cumae]]. Etruria's influence over the cities of [[Latium]] and Campania weakened, and the area was taken over by Romans and [[Samnites]].\n\nIn the 4th century&nbsp;BC, Etruria saw a [[Gaul|Gallic]] invasion end its influence over the [[Po Valley]] and the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic coast]]. Meanwhile, [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] had started annexing Etruscan cities. This led to the loss of the northern Etruscan provinces. During the [[Roman\u2013Etruscan Wars]], Etruria was conquered by Rome in the 3rd century&nbsp;BC.<ref name=\"historyone\"/><ref name=\"historytwo\"/>\n\n===Etruscan League===\n{{main|Etruscan cities}}\n[[File:0 Mars de Todi - Museo Gregoriano Etruscano (1).JPG|thumb|The [[Mars of Todi]], an Etruscan [[bronze sculpture]], c.&nbsp;400&nbsp;BC]]\nAccording to legend,<ref>Livy VII.21</ref> there was a period between 600&nbsp;BC and 500&nbsp;BC in which an [[Political alliance|alliance]] was formed among twelve Etruscan settlements, known today as the ''Etruscan League'', ''Etruscan Federation'', or ''Dodecapolis'' (in Greek \u0394\u03c9\u03b4\u03b5\u03ba\u03ac\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2). According to a legend the Etruscan League of twelve cities was founded by [[Tarchon]] and his brother [[Tyrrhenus]]. Tarchon lent his name to the city of [[Tarquinia|Tarchna]], or Tarquinnii, as it was known by the Romans. Tyrrhenus gave his name to the [[Tyrrhenians]], the alternative name for the Etruscans. Although there is no consensus on which cities were in the league, the following list may be close to the mark: [[Arezzo|Arretium]], [[Cerveteri|Caisra]], [[Chiusi|Clevsin]], [[Cortona|Curtun]], [[Perugia|Perusna]], [[Populonia|Pupluna]], [[Veii]], [[Tarquinia|Tarchna]], [[Vetulonia|Vetluna]], [[Volterra]], [[Bolsena|Velzna]], and [[Vulci|Velch]].

During the later [[Roman Empire|imperial]] times, when Etruria was just one of many regions controlled by Rome, the number of cities in the league increased by three. This is noted on many later grave stones from the 2nd century&nbsp;BC onwards. According to [[Livy]], the twelve [[city-state]]s met once a year at the [[Fanum Voltumnae]] at [[Volsinii]], where a leader was chosen to represent the league.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mysteriousetruscans.com/cities.html |title=The Etruscan League of 12 |website=mysteriousetruscans.com |date=2 April 2009 |accessdate=2015-04-25 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThere were two other Etruscan leagues (\"[[Lega dei popoli]]\"): that of [[Campania]], the main city of which was [[Capua]], and the [[Po Valley]] city-states in northern Italy, which included [[Bologna]], [[Spina]] and [[Adria]].\n\n===Possible founding of Rome===\n{{Main|Founding of Rome}}\n[[File:20090414-Civit\u00e0-di-Bagnoregio.jpg|thumb|right|A former Etruscan walled town, [[Civita di Bagnoregio]]]]\n[[File:Capitoline she-wolf Musei Capitolini MC1181.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Capitoline Wolf]]'', long considered an Etruscan bronze, feeding the twins [[Romulus and Remus]]]]\nThose who subscribe to a [[Latin (people)|Latin]] foundation of Rome followed by an Etruscan invasion typically speak of an Etruscan \"influence\" on Roman culture \u2013 that is, cultural objects which were adopted by Rome from neighbouring Etruria. The prevailing view is that Rome was founded by Latins who later merged with Etruscans. In this interpretation, Etruscan cultural objects are considered influences rather than part of a heritage.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GrnsU27t2X8C&pg=PA810&dq=Rome+was+founded+by+Italics&hl=en&ei=Tx5xTt2tBaq30AGXr_WKCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CFUQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=The Shakespeare Name Dictionary |year=2004 |accessdate=2011-09-14 |first1=Madison |last1=Davis |first2=Daniel |last2=Frankforter}}</ref> Rome was probably a small settlement until the arrival of the Etruscans, who constructed the first elements of its urban infrastructure such as the drainage system.<ref>{{cite book |author=Cunningham, Reich |title=Cultures and Values: A survey of the humanities |publisher=Thomson/Wadsworth |year=2006 |url=https://archive.org/details/culturevaluessur02cunn |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/culturevaluessur02cunn/page/92 92] |quote=The later Romans' own grandiose picture of the early days of their city was intended to glamorize its origins, but only with the arrival of the Etruscans did anything like an urban center begin to develop.|isbn=978-0534582272 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Hughes |title=Rome: A cultural, visual, and personal history |year=2012 |page=24 |quote=Some Roman technical achievements began in Etruscan expertise.

Many, if not most, of the Etruscan cities were older than Rome. If one finds that a given feature was there first, it cannot have originated at Rome. A second criterion is the opinion of the ancient sources. These would indicate that certain institutions and customs came directly from the Etruscans. Rome is located on the edge of what was Etruscan territory. When Etruscan settlements turned up south of the border, it was presumed that the Etruscans spread there after the foundation of Rome, but the settlements are now known to have preceded Rome.\n\nEtruscan settlements were frequently built on hills \u2013 the steeper the better \u2013 and surrounded by thick walls. According to [[Roman mythology]], when [[Romulus and Remus]] founded Rome, they did so on the [[Palatine Hill]] according to Etruscan ritual; that is, they began with a ''[[pomerium]]'' or sacred ditch. Then, they proceeded to the walls. Romulus was required to kill Remus when the latter jumped over the wall, breaking its magic spell (see also under [[Pons Sublicius]]). The name of Rome is attested in Etruscan in the form ''Ruma-\u03c7'' meaning 'Roman', a form that mirrors other attested ethnonyms in that language with the same suffix ''-\u03c7'': ''Velzna-\u03c7'' '(someone) from Volsinii' and ''Sveama-\u03c7'' '(someone) from Sovana'. This in itself, however, is not enough to prove Etruscan origin conclusively. If Tiberius is from ''\u03b8efarie'', then Ruma would have been placed on the ''Thefar'' ([[Tiber]]) river. A heavily discussed topic among scholars is who was the founding population of Rome. In 390&nbsp;BC, the city of Rome was attacked by the [[Gauls]], and as a result may have lost many \u2013 though not all \u2013 of its earlier records. Certainly, the history of Rome before that date is not as secure as it later becomes, but enough material remains to give a good picture of the development of the city and its institutions.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nLater history relates that some Etruscans lived in the ''[[Vicus Tuscus]]'',<ref>Tacitus, Cornelius. ''The Annals & The Histories''. Trans. Alfred Church and William Brodribb. New York, 2003.</ref> the \"Etruscan quarter\", and that there was an Etruscan line of kings (albeit ones descended from a Greek, [[Demaratus of Corinth]]) that succeeded kings of Latin and Sabine origin. Etruscophile historians would argue that this, together with evidence for institutions, religious elements and other cultural elements, proves that Rome was founded by Italics. The true picture is rather more complicated, not least because the Etruscan cities were separate entities which never came together to form a single Etruscan state. Furthermore, there were strong Latin and Italic elements to Roman culture, and later Romans proudly celebrated these multiple, 'multicultural' influences on the city.\n\nUnder Romulus and [[Numa Pompilius]], the people were said to have been divided into thirty [[curia]]e and three [[Roman tribe|tribes]]. Few Etruscan words entered [[Latin]], but the names of at least two of the tribes \u2013 ''Ramnes'' and ''Luceres'' \u2013 seem to be Etruscan. The last kings may have borne the Etruscan title ''lucumo'', while the [[regalia]] were traditionally considered of Etruscan origin \u2013 the golden crown, the sceptre, the ''toga palmata'' (a special robe), the ''sella curulis'' (curule chair), and above all the primary symbol of state power: The ''[[fasces]]''. The latter was a bundle of whipping rods surrounding a double-bladed [[axe]], carried by the king's [[lictor]]s. An example of the fasces are the remains of bronze rods and the axe from a tomb in Etruscan [[Vetulonia]]. This allowed archaeologists to identify the depiction of a fasces on the grave [[stele]] of Avele Feluske, who is shown as a warrior wielding the fasces. The most telling Etruscan feature is the word ''populus'', which appears as an Etruscan deity, Fufluns. ''Populus'' seems to mean the people assembled in a military body, rather than the general populace.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n=== Roman families of Etruscan origin ===\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|style=width: 600px; |\n* [[Ancharia (gens)]]\n* [[Arruntia (gens)]]\n* [[Caecina (gens)]]\n* [[Caelia (gens)]]\n* [[Caesennia (gens)]]\n* [[Ceionia (gens)]]\n* [[Cilnia (gens)]]\n* [[Herminia (gens)]] \u2013 [[Patrician (ancient Rome)| Patrician]]\n* [[Erucia (gens)]]\n* [[Lartia (gens)]] \u2013 Patrician\n* [[Perperna (gens)]]\n* [[Persia (gens)]]\n* [[Rasinia gens|Rasinia (gens)]]\n* [[Sanquinia gens|Sanquinia (gens)]]\n* [[Tarquinia (gens)]] \u2013 Patrician (?)\n* [[Tarquitia (gens)]] \u2013 Patrician\n* [[Verginia (gens)]] \u2013 Patrician\n*[[ Volumnia (gens)]] \u2013 Patrician\n}}\n\n==Society==\n{{Main|Etruscan society}}\n\n===Government===\n{{Main|Etruscan society#Government|l1=Etruscan governance}}\n[[File:Etruscan mother and child 500 to 450 BCE.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Etruscan mother and child, 500\u2013450&nbsp;BC]]\nThe historical Etruscans had achieved a [[Sovereign state|state]] system of society, with remnants of the [[chiefdom]] and tribal forms. In this, they were different from the surrounding Italics, who had [[Tribal chief|chief]]s and tribes.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} Rome was in a sense the first Italic state, but it began as an Etruscan one. It is believed that the Etruscan government style changed from total [[monarchy]] to [[oligarchic]] [[republic]] (as the Roman Republic) in the 6th&nbsp;century&nbsp;BC, although it is important to note this did not happen to all the city-states.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe government was viewed as being a central authority, ruling over all tribal and clan organizations. It retained the power of life and death; in fact, the [[gorgon]], an ancient symbol of that power, appears as a motif in Etruscan decoration. The adherents to this state power were united by a common religion. Political unity in Etruscan society was the city-state, which was probably the referent of ''methlum'', \"district\". Etruscan texts name quite a number of [[magistrate]]s, without much of a hint as to their function: The ''camthi'', the ''parnich'', the ''purth'', the ''tamera'', the ''macstrev'', and so on. The people were the ''mech''. The chief ruler of a ''methlum'' was perhaps a ''zilach''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n===Family===\n{{Main|Etruscan society#Rise of the family|l1=Etruscan society: Rise of the family}}\n[[File:Paris - Louvre - Sarcophage.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Sarcophagus of the Spouses, ([[Louvre]], Room&nbsp;18)]]\nThe princely tombs were not of individuals. The inscription evidence shows that families were interred there over long periods, marking the growth of the aristocratic family as a fixed institution, parallel to the [[gens]] at Rome and perhaps even its model. The Etruscans could have used any model of the eastern Mediterranean. That the growth of this class is related to the new acquisition of wealth through trade is unquestioned. The wealthiest cities were located near the coast. At the centre of the society was the married couple, ''tusurthir''. The Etruscans were a monogamous society that emphasized pairing.\n\nSimilarly, the behaviour of some wealthy women is not uniquely Etruscan. The apparent promiscuous revelry has a spiritual explanation. Swaddling and Bonfante (among others) explain that depictions of the nude embrace, or symplegma, \"had the power to ward off evil\", as did baring the breast, which was adopted by [[western culture]] as an [[apotropaic magic|apotropaic device]], appearing finally on the figureheads of sailing ships as a nude female upper torso. It is also possible that Greek and Roman attitudes to the Etruscans were based on a misunderstanding of the place of women within their society. In both Greece and the Earliest Republican Rome, respectable women were confined to the house and mixed-sex socialising did not occur. Thus, the freedom of women within Etruscan society could have been misunderstood as implying their sexual availability.<ref>Briquel, Dominique; Svensson P\u00e4r (2007). Etruskerna.

In addition to marking the rank and power of certain individuals, warfare was a considerable economic advantage to Etruscan civilization. Like many ancient societies, the Etruscans conducted campaigns during summer months, raiding neighboring areas, attempting to gain territory and combating [[piracy]] as a means of acquiring valuable resources, such as land, prestige, goods, and slaves. It is likely that individuals taken in battle would be ransomed back to their families and clans at high cost. Prisoners could also potentially be sacrificed on tombs as an honor to fallen leaders of Etruscan society, not unlike the sacrifices made by [[Achilles]] for [[Patroclus|Patrocles]].<ref name=\"bookone\">{{cite book|author=Mario Torelli |title=The Etruscans |publisher=Rizzoli International Publications |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"booktwo\">{{cite book |author=Trevor Dupey |title=The Harper Encyclopedia of Military History |publisher=Rizzoli Harper Collins Publisher |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"bookthree\">{{cite book|author=Dora Jane Hamblin |title=The Etruscans |url=https://archive.org/details/etruscans00hamb |url-access=registration |publisher=Time Life Books |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n=== Cities ===\n{{Main|Etruscan cities}}\nThe range of Etruscan civilization is marked by [[Etruscan cities|its cities]].

How to understand the will of deities, and how to behave, had been revealed to the Etruscans by two initiators, [[Tages]], a childlike figure born from tilled land and immediately gifted with prescience, and [[Vegoia]], a female figure. Their teachings were kept in a series of sacred books. Three layers of deities are evident in the extensive Etruscan art motifs. One appears to be divinities of an indigenous nature: [[Etruscan mythology|Catha]] and [[Usil]], the sun; ''Tivr'', the moon; [[Selvans]], a civil god; [[Turan (goddess)|Turan]], the goddess of love; [[Laran]], the god of war; [[Leinth]], the goddess of death; [[Maris (mythology)|Maris]]; [[Thalna]]; [[Turms]]; and the ever-popular [[Fufluns]], whose name is related in some way to the city of [[Populonia]] and the [[populus Romanus]], possibly, the god of the people.<ref name=\"bookonereligion\">{{cite book|author1=De Grummond |author2=Nancy Thomson |year=2006 |title=Etruscan Mythology, Sacred History and Legend: An Introduction |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"booktworeligion\">{{cite book |author=Erika Simon |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hQtbJyFCd40C&pg=PA1&dq=Etruscan+religion |title=The religion of the Etruscans |via=Google Books | isbn=978-0-292-70687-3 |df=dmy-all|date = 2009-04-20}}</ref>\n\nRuling over this pantheon of lesser deities were higher ones that seem to reflect the [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European]] system: Tin or [[Tinia]], the sky, Uni his wife ([[Juno (mythology)|Juno]]), and [[Cel (goddess)|Cel]], the earth goddess.

In turn, [[ancient Roman architecture]] began with Etruscan styles, and then accepted still further Greek influence. [[Roman temple]]s show many of the same differences in form to Greek ones that Etruscan temples do, but like the Greeks, use stone, in which they closely copy Greek conventions. The houses of the wealthy were evidently often large and comfortable, but the burial chambers of tombs, often filled with grave-goods, are the nearest approach to them to survive. In the southern Etruscan area, tombs have large rock-cut chambers under a [[tumulus]] in large [[Necropolis|necropoleis]], and these, together with some city walls, are the only Etruscan constructions to survive.

Etruscan sculpture in cast bronze was famous and widely exported, but few large examples have survived (the material was too valuable, and recycled later). In contrast to terracotta and bronze, there was apparently little Etruscan sculpture in stone, despite the Etruscans controlling fine sources of marble, including [[Carrara marble]], which seems not to have been exploited until the Romans. Most surviving Etruscan art comes from tombs, including all the [[fresco]] wall-paintings, which show scenes of feasting and some narrative mythological subjects.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n[[Bucchero]] wares in black were the early and native styles of fine Etruscan pottery. There was also a tradition of elaborate [[Etruscan vase painting]], which sprung from its Greek equivalent; the Etruscans were the main export market for [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Greek vases]]. Etruscan temples were heavily decorated with colourfully painted terracotta [[antefix]]es and other fittings, which survive in large numbers where the wooden superstructure has vanished. Etruscan art was strongly connected to [[Etruscan religion|religion]]; the afterlife was of major importance in Etruscan art.<ref name=\"etruscianartmusic\">{{cite book |title=Etruscan Art |first=Nigel |last=Spivey |year=1997 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |location=London}}</ref>\n\nThe Etruscan musical instruments seen in frescoes and bas-reliefs are different types of pipes, such as the [[aulos|plagiaulos]] (the pipes of [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] or [[Syrinx]]), the alabaster pipe and the famous double pipes, accompanied on percussion instruments such as the [[Tintinnabulum (Ancient Rome)|tintinnabulum]], [[Timpani|tympanum]] and [[crotales]], and later by stringed instruments like the [[lyre]] and [[kithara]].\n\n===Language===\n{{Main|Etruscan language|Tyrsenian languages}}\n[[File:Perugia, Museo archeologico Nazionale dell'Umbria, cippo di Perugia.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Cippus Perusinus]]. 3rd\u20132nd century BC, San Marco near [[Perugia]]]]\nEtruscans left around 13,000 [[epigraphy|inscriptions]] which have been found so far, only a small minority of which are of significant length. Attested from 700 BC to AD 50, the relation of Etruscan to other languages has been a source of long-running speculation and study. The Etruscans are believed to have spoken a [[Pre\u2013Indo-European languages|pre\u2013Indo-European language]],<ref>[[Massimo Pallottino]], ''La langue \u00e9trusque Probl\u00e8mes et perspectives'', 1978.</ref><ref>Mauro Cristofani, ''Introduction to the study of the Etruscan'', Leo S. Olschki, 1991.</ref><ref>Romolo A.

Since [[Helmut Rix|Rix]] (1998), it is widely accepted that the Tyrsenian family groups [[Raetic language|Raetic]] and [[Lemnian language|Lemnian]] are related to Etruscan.<ref name=\"Rix-2008\" />\n\n===Literature===\n[[File:Lanena_knjiga_(Liber_linteus_Zagrebiensis).jpg|thumb|right|220px|Samples of Etruscan script, from the [[Liber linteus]]]]\nEtruscan texts, written in a space of seven centuries, use a form of the [[Greek alphabet]] due to close contact between the Etruscans and the Greek colonies at [[Ischia|Pithecusae]] and [[Cumae]] in the 8th&nbsp;century&nbsp;BC (until it was no longer used, at the beginning of the 1st&nbsp;century&nbsp;AD). Etruscan inscriptions disappeared from [[Chiusi]], [[Perugia]] and [[Arezzo]] around this time. Only a few fragments survive, religious and especially funeral texts most of which are late (from the 4th&nbsp;century&nbsp;BC). In addition to the original texts that have survived to this day, we have a large number of quotations and allusions from classical authors. In the 1st&nbsp;century&nbsp;BC, [[Diodorus Siculus]] wrote that literary culture was one of the great achievements of the Etruscans. Little is known of it and even what is known of their language is due to the repetition of the same few words in the many inscriptions found (by way of the modern epitaphs) contrasted in bilingual or trilingual texts with Latin and [[Punic language|Punic]]. Out of the aforementioned genres, is just one such Volnio (Volnius) cited in classical sources mention.<ref>[[Varro]], ''De lingua Latina'', 5.55.</ref> With a few exceptions, such as the [[Liber Linteus]], the [[Thesaurus Linguae Etruscae|only written records in the Etruscan language]] that remain are inscriptions, mainly funerary.

However, it is certain that the political structure of the Etruscan culture was similar to, albeit more aristocratic than, [[Magna Graecia]] in the south. The mining and commerce of metal, especially [[copper]] and [[Iron (material)|iron]], led to an enrichment of the Etruscans and to the expansion of their influence in the Italian peninsula and the western [[Mediterranean Sea]].

Though the battle had no clear winner, [[Carthage]] managed to expand its sphere of influence at the expense of the Greeks, and Etruria saw itself relegated to the northern [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] with full ownership of [[Corsica]]. From the first half of the 5th&nbsp;century&nbsp;BC, the new political situation meant the beginning of the Etruscan decline after losing their southern provinces. In 480&nbsp;BC, Etruria's ally Carthage was defeated by a coalition of Magna Graecia cities led by [[Syracuse, Sicily]]. A few years later, in 474&nbsp;BC, Syracuse's tyrant [[Hiero I of Syracuse|Hiero]] defeated the Etruscans at the [[Battle of Cumae]]. Etruria's influence over the cities of [[Latium]] and Campania weakened, and the area was taken over by Romans and [[Samnites]].\n\nIn the 4th century&nbsp;BC, Etruria saw a [[Gaul|Gallic]] invasion end its influence over the [[Po Valley]] and the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic coast]]. Meanwhile, [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] had started annexing Etruscan cities. This led to the loss of the northern Etruscan provinces. During the [[Roman\u2013Etruscan Wars]], Etruria was conquered by Rome in the 3rd century&nbsp;BC.<ref name=\"historyone\"/><ref name=\"historytwo\"/>\n\n===Etruscan League===\n{{main|Etruscan cities}}\n[[File:0 Mars de Todi - Museo Gregoriano Etruscano (1).JPG|thumb|The [[Mars of Todi]], an Etruscan [[bronze sculpture]], c.&nbsp;400&nbsp;BC]]\nAccording to legend,<ref>Livy VII.21</ref> there was a period between 600&nbsp;BC and 500&nbsp;BC in which an [[Political alliance|alliance]] was formed among twelve Etruscan settlements, known today as the ''Etruscan League'', ''Etruscan Federation'', or ''Dodecapolis'' (in Greek \u0394\u03c9\u03b4\u03b5\u03ba\u03ac\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2). According to a legend the Etruscan League of twelve cities was founded by [[Tarchon]] and his brother [[Tyrrhenus]]. Tarchon lent his name to the city of [[Tarquinia|Tarchna]], or Tarquinnii, as it was known by the Romans. Tyrrhenus gave his name to the [[Tyrrhenians]], the alternative name for the Etruscans. Although there is no consensus on which cities were in the league, the following list may be close to the mark: [[Arezzo|Arretium]], [[Cerveteri|Caisra]], [[Chiusi|Clevsin]], [[Cortona|Curtun]], [[Perugia|Perusna]], [[Populonia|Pupluna]], [[Veii]], [[Tarquinia|Tarchna]], [[Vetulonia|Vetluna]], [[Volterra]], [[Bolsena|Velzna]], and [[Vulci|Velch]].

During the later [[Roman Empire|imperial]] times, when Etruria was just one of many regions controlled by Rome, the number of cities in the league increased by three.

In this interpretation, Etruscan cultural objects are considered influences rather than part of a heritage.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GrnsU27t2X8C&pg=PA810&dq=Rome+was+founded+by+Italics&hl=en&ei=Tx5xTt2tBaq30AGXr_WKCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CFUQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=The Shakespeare Name Dictionary |year=2004 |accessdate=2011-09-14 |first1=Madison |last1=Davis |first2=Daniel |last2=Frankforter}}</ref> Rome was probably a small settlement until the arrival of the Etruscans, who constructed the first elements of its urban infrastructure such as the drainage system.<ref>{{cite book |author=Cunningham, Reich |title=Cultures and Values: A survey of the humanities |publisher=Thomson/Wadsworth |year=2006 |url=https://archive.org/details/culturevaluessur02cunn |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/culturevaluessur02cunn/page/92 92] |quote=The later Romans' own grandiose picture of the early days of their city was intended to glamorize its origins, but only with the arrival of the Etruscans did anything like an urban center begin to develop.|isbn=978-0534582272 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Hughes |title=Rome: A cultural, visual, and personal history |year=2012 |page=24 |quote=Some Roman technical achievements began in Etruscan expertise.

Many, if not most, of the Etruscan cities were older than Rome. If one finds that a given feature was there first, it cannot have originated at Rome. A second criterion is the opinion of the ancient sources. These would indicate that certain institutions and customs came directly from the Etruscans. Rome is located on the edge of what was Etruscan territory. When Etruscan settlements turned up south of the border, it was presumed that the Etruscans spread there after the foundation of Rome, but the settlements are now known to have preceded Rome.\n\nEtruscan settlements were frequently built on hills \u2013 the steeper the better \u2013 and surrounded by thick walls. According to [[Roman mythology]], when [[Romulus and Remus]] founded Rome, they did so on the [[Palatine Hill]] according to Etruscan ritual; that is, they began with a ''[[pomerium]]'' or sacred ditch. Then, they proceeded to the walls. Romulus was required to kill Remus when the latter jumped over the wall, breaking its magic spell (see also under [[Pons Sublicius]]). The name of Rome is attested in Etruscan in the form ''Ruma-\u03c7'' meaning 'Roman', a form that mirrors other attested ethnonyms in that language with the same suffix ''-\u03c7'': ''Velzna-\u03c7'' '(someone) from Volsinii' and ''Sveama-\u03c7'' '(someone) from Sovana'. This in itself, however, is not enough to prove Etruscan origin conclusively. If Tiberius is from ''\u03b8efarie'', then Ruma would have been placed on the ''Thefar'' ([[Tiber]]) river. A heavily discussed topic among scholars is who was the founding population of Rome. In 390&nbsp;BC, the city of Rome was attacked by the [[Gauls]], and as a result may have lost many \u2013 though not all \u2013 of its earlier records. Certainly, the history of Rome before that date is not as secure as it later becomes, but enough material remains to give a good picture of the development of the city and its institutions.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nLater history relates that some Etruscans lived in the ''[[Vicus Tuscus]]'',<ref>Tacitus, Cornelius. ''The Annals & The Histories''. Trans. Alfred Church and William Brodribb. New York, 2003.</ref> the \"Etruscan quarter\", and that there was an Etruscan line of kings (albeit ones descended from a Greek, [[Demaratus of Corinth]]) that succeeded kings of Latin and Sabine origin. Etruscophile historians would argue that this, together with evidence for institutions, religious elements and other cultural elements, proves that Rome was founded by Italics. The true picture is rather more complicated, not least because the Etruscan cities were separate entities which never came together to form a single Etruscan state. Furthermore, there were strong Latin and Italic elements to Roman culture, and later Romans proudly celebrated these multiple, 'multicultural' influences on the city.\n\nUnder Romulus and [[Numa Pompilius]], the people were said to have been divided into thirty [[curia]]e and three [[Roman tribe|tribes]]. Few Etruscan words entered [[Latin]], but the names of at least two of the tribes \u2013 ''Ramnes'' and ''Luceres'' \u2013 seem to be Etruscan. The last kings may have borne the Etruscan title ''lucumo'', while the [[regalia]] were traditionally considered of Etruscan origin \u2013 the golden crown, the sceptre, the ''toga palmata'' (a special robe), the ''sella curulis'' (curule chair), and above all the primary symbol of state power: The ''[[fasces]]''. The latter was a bundle of whipping rods surrounding a double-bladed [[axe]], carried by the king's [[lictor]]s. An example of the fasces are the remains of bronze rods and the axe from a tomb in Etruscan [[Vetulonia]]. This allowed archaeologists to identify the depiction of a fasces on the grave [[stele]] of Avele Feluske, who is shown as a warrior wielding the fasces. The most telling Etruscan feature is the word ''populus'', which appears as an Etruscan deity, Fufluns. ''Populus'' seems to mean the people assembled in a military body, rather than the general populace.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n=== Roman families of Etruscan origin ===\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|style=width: 600px; |\n* [[Ancharia (gens)]]\n* [[Arruntia (gens)]]\n* [[Caecina (gens)]]\n* [[Caelia (gens)]]\n* [[Caesennia (gens)]]\n* [[Ceionia (gens)]]\n* [[Cilnia (gens)]]\n* [[Herminia (gens)]] \u2013 [[Patrician (ancient Rome)| Patrician]]\n* [[Erucia (gens)]]\n* [[Lartia (gens)]] \u2013 Patrician\n* [[Perperna (gens)]]\n* [[Persia (gens)]]\n* [[Rasinia gens|Rasinia (gens)]]\n* [[Sanquinia gens|Sanquinia (gens)]]\n* [[Tarquinia (gens)]] \u2013 Patrician (?)\n* [[Tarquitia (gens)]] \u2013 Patrician\n* [[Verginia (gens)]] \u2013 Patrician\n*[[ Volumnia (gens)]] \u2013 Patrician\n}}\n\n==Society==\n{{Main|Etruscan society}}\n\n===Government===\n{{Main|Etruscan society#Government|l1=Etruscan governance}}\n[[File:Etruscan mother and child 500 to 450 BCE.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Etruscan mother and child, 500\u2013450&nbsp;BC]]\nThe historical Etruscans had achieved a [[Sovereign state|state]] system of society, with remnants of the [[chiefdom]] and tribal forms. In this, they were different from the surrounding Italics, who had [[Tribal chief|chief]]s and tribes.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} Rome was in a sense the first Italic state, but it began as an Etruscan one. It is believed that the Etruscan government style changed from total [[monarchy]] to [[oligarchic]] [[republic]] (as the Roman Republic) in the 6th&nbsp;century&nbsp;BC, although it is important to note this did not happen to all the city-states.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe government was viewed as being a central authority, ruling over all tribal and clan organizations. It retained the power of life and death; in fact, the [[gorgon]], an ancient symbol of that power, appears as a motif in Etruscan decoration. The adherents to this state power were united by a common religion. Political unity in Etruscan society was the city-state, which was probably the referent of ''methlum'', \"district\". Etruscan texts name quite a number of [[magistrate]]s, without much of a hint as to their function: The ''camthi'', the ''parnich'', the ''purth'', the ''tamera'', the ''macstrev'', and so on. The people were the ''mech''.

The inscription evidence shows that families were interred there over long periods, marking the growth of the aristocratic family as a fixed institution, parallel to the [[gens]] at Rome and perhaps even its model. The Etruscans could have used any model of the eastern Mediterranean. That the growth of this class is related to the new acquisition of wealth through trade is unquestioned. The wealthiest cities were located near the coast. At the centre of the society was the married couple, ''tusurthir''. The Etruscans were a monogamous society that emphasized pairing.\n\nSimilarly, the behaviour of some wealthy women is not uniquely Etruscan. The apparent promiscuous revelry has a spiritual explanation. Swaddling and Bonfante (among others) explain that depictions of the nude embrace, or symplegma, \"had the power to ward off evil\", as did baring the breast, which was adopted by [[western culture]] as an [[apotropaic magic|apotropaic device]], appearing finally on the figureheads of sailing ships as a nude female upper torso. It is also possible that Greek and Roman attitudes to the Etruscans were based on a misunderstanding of the place of women within their society. In both Greece and the Earliest Republican Rome, respectable women were confined to the house and mixed-sex socialising did not occur. Thus, the freedom of women within Etruscan society could have been misunderstood as implying their sexual availability.<ref>Briquel, Dominique; Svensson P\u00e4r (2007). Etruskerna.

In addition to marking the rank and power of certain individuals, warfare was a considerable economic advantage to Etruscan civilization. Like many ancient societies, the Etruscans conducted campaigns during summer months, raiding neighboring areas, attempting to gain territory and combating [[piracy]] as a means of acquiring valuable resources, such as land, prestige, goods, and slaves. It is likely that individuals taken in battle would be ransomed back to their families and clans at high cost.

How to understand the will of deities, and how to behave, had been revealed to the Etruscans by two initiators, [[Tages]], a childlike figure born from tilled land and immediately gifted with prescience, and [[Vegoia]], a female figure. Their teachings were kept in a series of sacred books. Three layers of deities are evident in the extensive Etruscan art motifs. One appears to be divinities of an indigenous nature: [[Etruscan mythology|Catha]] and [[Usil]], the sun; ''Tivr'', the moon; [[Selvans]], a civil god; [[Turan (goddess)|Turan]], the goddess of love; [[Laran]], the god of war; [[Leinth]], the goddess of death; [[Maris (mythology)|Maris]]; [[Thalna]]; [[Turms]]; and the ever-popular [[Fufluns]], whose name is related in some way to the city of [[Populonia]] and the [[populus Romanus]], possibly, the god of the people.<ref name=\"bookonereligion\">{{cite book|author1=De Grummond |author2=Nancy Thomson |year=2006 |title=Etruscan Mythology, Sacred History and Legend: An Introduction |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"booktworeligion\">{{cite book |author=Erika Simon |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hQtbJyFCd40C&pg=PA1&dq=Etruscan+religion |title=The religion of the Etruscans |via=Google Books | isbn=978-0-292-70687-3 |df=dmy-all|date = 2009-04-20}}</ref>\n\nRuling over this pantheon of lesser deities were higher ones that seem to reflect the [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European]] system: Tin or [[Tinia]], the sky, Uni his wife ([[Juno (mythology)|Juno]]), and [[Cel (goddess)|Cel]], the earth goddess.

The houses of the wealthy were evidently often large and comfortable, but the burial chambers of tombs, often filled with grave-goods, are the nearest approach to them to survive. In the southern Etruscan area, tombs have large rock-cut chambers under a [[tumulus]] in large [[Necropolis|necropoleis]], and these, together with some city walls, are the only Etruscan constructions to survive.

She was the [[Australian House of Representatives|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Division of Curtin|Curtin]] from 1998 to 2019. She is the first female [[Chancellor (education)|chancellor]] of the [[Australian National University]], commencing in January 2020.\n\nBishop was born in [[Lobethal]], [[South Australia]], and studied law at the [[University of Adelaide]]. Prior to entering politics she worked as a commercial lawyer in [[Perth, Western Australia]]; she was the local managing partner of [[Clayton Utz]]. She was a delegate to the [[Australian Constitutional Convention 1998|1998 constitutional convention]], and also served as a director of the [[Special Broadcasting Service]] (SBS) and as a member of the [[Murdoch University]] senate. Bishop was elected to parliament at the [[1998 Australian federal election|1998 federal election]], representing the [[Division of Curtin]] in Perth's western suburbs. In the [[Howard Government]], she served as [[Minister for Ageing (Australia)|Minister for Ageing]] (2003\u20132006), [[Minister for Education (Australia)|Minister for Education and Science]] (2006\u20132007), and [[Minister for Women (Australia)|Minister for Women]] (2006\u20132007).\n\nAfter the [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] lost the [[2007 Australian federal election|2007 election]], Bishop was elected deputy leader of the Liberal Party. She was the first woman to hold the position, and was re-elected to the post at multiple [[leadership spill]]s following her initial election. During her time as deputy, there were three different Liberal leaders\u2014[[Brendan Nelson]], [[Malcolm Turnbull]], and [[Tony Abbott]]. When the Coalition returned to power at the [[2013 Australian federal election|2013 election]], Bishop was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs in the [[Abbott Government]]. She was Australia's first female foreign minister. Issues that arose during her tenure included changes to the [[Australian Aid|Australian foreign aid program]], the [[international military intervention against ISIL]], the shooting down of [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]], and the execution of Australian citizens by Indonesia.\n\nIn August 2018, [[Peter Dutton]] challenged Turnbull for the leadership of the Liberal Party, due to dissatisfaction from the party's conservative wing. Turnbull defeated Dutton in a leadership ballot, but tensions continued to mount and the party voted in favour of holding [[Liberal Party of Australia leadership spills, 2018|a second spill]]; Bishop chose to be a candidate. In the second vote, Bishop was eliminated in the first round by [[Peter Dutton]] and [[Scott Morrison]], with Morrison elected as party leader (and thus prime minister) in the second round.<ref>{{cite news|title=Scott Morrison wins Liberal party leadership spill|url=https://www.9news.com.au/2018/08/23/13/57/five-things-you-need-to-know-about-scott-morrison|work=Nine News|date=24 August 2018|accessdate=24 August 2018}}</ref> She declined to retain the foreign affairs portfolio in the [[First Morrison Ministry|Morrison Ministry]], instead moving to the [[backbench]].

These changes included abolition of the Australian foreign aid agency, AusAID, and extensive expenditure cuts.<ref>Jack Corbett, 2017, ''Australia's Foreign Aid Dilemma: Humanitarian Aspirations confront Democratic Legitimacy''., Abdingdon, Oxon: Routledge {{ISBN|978-1-138-69671-6}} (hbk).</ref>\n\nThe new government was sworn into office on 18 September 2013. Incoming Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced the same day that AusAID would be integrated into the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFAT). The news of the proposed integration had been conveyed by Bishop to senior AusAID staff some days earlier.<ref>Corbett, op.cit., p.133.</ref> The official explanation for the integration of AusAID into DFAT was that \u201cIntegration will enable DFAT to better pursue Australia\u2019s national interests by ensuring closer alignment and mutually reinforcing linkages among the Government\u2019s aid, foreign affairs and trade efforts.\u201d<ref>Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. 2014. ''Submission to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee Inquiry into Australia's Overseas Aid and Development Assistance Program'', 7 February. p.1.</ref>\n\nThe impact of the integration on the quality of Australia's aid program led to considerable debate.<ref>An independent review of the integration process five years after the change was issued in early 2019.  See Richard Moore, '[http://devpolicy.org/publications/reports/DFAT-AusAIDIntegrationReview-FullVersion.pdf Strategic Choice: A future-focused review of the DFAT-AusAID integration'], February 2019, Canberra: ANU, Development Policy Centre.  See also Corbett, op.cit., p. 136.</ref>  Sceptics pointed to the departure of a considerable number of experienced aid professionals from the former AusAID while the process of integration was taking place and argued that the culture and priorities of DFAT were not supportive of a quality aid program.  Those in favour of the change argued that closer alignment with foreign affairs would ensure that the aid program was more relevant and would provide better value for money.<ref>Greg Sheridan 2014.

In Opposition, the Liberal Party had publicly endorsed the aim of maintaining the Australian aid budget at the level of 0.5% of GDP.<ref>Corbett, op.cit, p. 132.</ref>  Aid spending amounted to around $5.0 billion in 2014/15.  However budget cuts introduced after the new government took office led to marked reductions. Expenditure was reduced to around $4.2 billion in 2015/16. Further reductions were introduced in following years.  Aid spending as a share of GDP fell from 0.32% in 2014/15 to an estimated 0.23% in 2018/19.<ref>Data is available at Development Policy Centre, Australian National University, ''[http://devpolicy.org/aidtracker/trends/ Aid Tracker]''.

She was the [[Australian House of Representatives|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Division of Curtin|Curtin]] from 1998 to 2019. She is the first female [[Chancellor (education)|chancellor]] of the [[Australian National University]], commencing in January 2020.\n\nBishop was born in [[Lobethal]], [[South Australia]], and studied law at the [[University of Adelaide]]. Prior to entering politics she worked as a commercial lawyer in [[Perth, Western Australia]]; she was the local managing partner of [[Clayton Utz]]. She was a delegate to the [[Australian Constitutional Convention 1998|1998 constitutional convention]], and also served as a director of the [[Special Broadcasting Service]] (SBS) and as a member of the [[Murdoch University]] senate. Bishop was elected to parliament at the [[1998 Australian federal election|1998 federal election]], representing the [[Division of Curtin]] in Perth's western suburbs. In the [[Howard Government]], she served as [[Minister for Ageing (Australia)|Minister for Ageing]] (2003\u20132006), [[Minister for Education (Australia)|Minister for Education and Science]] (2006\u20132007), and [[Minister for Women (Australia)|Minister for Women]] (2006\u20132007).\n\nAfter the [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] lost the [[2007 Australian federal election|2007 election]], Bishop was elected deputy leader of the Liberal Party.

During her time as deputy, there were three different Liberal leaders\u2014[[Brendan Nelson]], [[Malcolm Turnbull]], and [[Tony Abbott]]. When the Coalition returned to power at the [[2013 Australian federal election|2013 election]], Bishop was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs in the [[Abbott Government]]. She was Australia's first female foreign minister. Issues that arose during her tenure included changes to the [[Australian Aid|Australian foreign aid program]], the [[international military intervention against ISIL]], the shooting down of [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]], and the execution of Australian citizens by Indonesia.\n\nIn August 2018, [[Peter Dutton]] challenged Turnbull for the leadership of the Liberal Party, due to dissatisfaction from the party's conservative wing.

In the second vote, Bishop was eliminated in the first round by [[Peter Dutton]] and [[Scott Morrison]], with Morrison elected as party leader (and thus prime minister) in the second round.<ref>{{cite news|title=Scott Morrison wins Liberal party leadership spill|url=https://www.9news.com.au/2018/08/23/13/57/five-things-you-need-to-know-about-scott-morrison|work=Nine News|date=24 August 2018|accessdate=24 August 2018}}</ref> She declined to retain the foreign affairs portfolio in the [[First Morrison Ministry|Morrison Ministry]], instead moving to the [[backbench]].

These changes included abolition of the Australian foreign aid agency, AusAID, and extensive expenditure cuts.<ref>Jack Corbett, 2017, ''Australia's Foreign Aid Dilemma: Humanitarian Aspirations confront Democratic Legitimacy''., Abdingdon, Oxon: Routledge {{ISBN|978-1-138-69671-6}} (hbk).</ref>\n\nThe new government was sworn into office on 18 September 2013.

The news of the proposed integration had been conveyed by Bishop to senior AusAID staff some days earlier.<ref>Corbett, op.cit., p.133.</ref> The official explanation for the integration of AusAID into DFAT was that \u201cIntegration will enable DFAT to better pursue Australia\u2019s national interests by ensuring closer alignment and mutually reinforcing linkages among the Government\u2019s aid, foreign affairs and trade efforts.\u201d<ref>Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. 2014.

However budget cuts introduced after the new government took office led to marked reductions. Expenditure was reduced to around $4.2 billion in 2015/16.

It was released on August 23, 2019, through [[Republic Records]]. As the [[executive producer]], Swift worked with producers [[Jack Antonoff]], [[Louis Bell]], [[Frank Dukes]] and [[Joel Little]] on the album. Described by Swift as \"a love letter to love itself\", ''Lover'' celebrates the ups and downs of love, incorporating brighter and cheerful tones, departing from the dark sounds of its predecessor, ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]'' (2017). The album's cover art and music videos marked a change in Swift's visual appearance, which now embodies a [[summer]] aesthetic, consisting mainly of [[Pastel (color)|pastel colors]]. Musically, it is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[synth-pop]], [[electropop]] and [[pop rock]] record that contains influences of [[Country music|country]], [[dream pop]], [[bubblegum pop]], [[funk]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[pop punk]] and [[indie pop]].\n\n''Lover'' features collaborations with the [[Dixie Chicks]] and [[Brendon Urie]] of [[Panic! at the Disco]]. It was preceded by three singles, all peaking inside the top 10 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]; \"[[Me!]]\" and \"[[You Need to Calm Down]]\" peaked at number two, while the [[Lover (Taylor Swift song)|title track]] reached number 10. Breaking a string of records, all 18 tracks of ''Lover'' charted simultaneously on the Hot 100 chart upon the album's release, including the fourth single \"[[The Man (Taylor Swift song)|The Man]]\" that peaked at number 23. ''Lover'' received positive reviews from critics, who commended Swift's songwriting conveying emotional maturity and growth; however, a few of them found the album lengthy and inconsistent.  \n\n''Lover'' debuted at number-one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, moving 867,000 units in its first week. It also debuted at number one in many countries including Australia, Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain and the UK. ''Lover'' was certified [[RIAA certification|double platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] for moving over 2 million units in the US; it was the best selling album of 2019 in the country. Globally, ''Lover'' was the best selling studio album of 2019. As of January 2020, it has sold over 3.2 million pure copies worldwide. To promote the album, Swift was set to embark on the [[Lover Fest]], her sixth [[concert tour]] and first [[music festival]] tour, in 2020, but postponed to 2021 due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|Coronavirus pandemic]]. \n\n''Lover'' received a nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album|Best Pop Vocal Album]] at the [[62nd Annual Grammy Awards|62nd Grammy Awards]], which is Swift's third consecutive nomination in the category, following ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' (2014) and ''Reputation'' (2017), while its singles \"You Need To Calm Down\" and \"Lover\" were nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance|Best Pop Solo Performance]] and [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]], respectively. ''Lover'' appeared on several year-end best music lists of 2019, with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']] naming it the number-one best album of 2019.\n\n==Background==\nSpeculation of the album started on February 24, 2019, when Swift posted a photo of seven palm trees to her [[Instagram]] account,<ref>{{cite web |last=Elizabeth |first=De |title=Taylor Swift Might Have Just Dropped a Huge Clue About Her Next Album |url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/taylor-swift-instagram-palm-trees-fan-theories-next-album |website=Teen Vogue |accessdate=July 9, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190326190044/https://www.teenvogue.com/story/taylor-swift-instagram-palm-trees-fan-theories-next-album |archive-date=March 26, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> which the singer later confirmed was the day she finished the album.<ref name=\"EWMay\">{{cite magazine|last=Suskind|first=Alex|title=New Reputation: Taylor Swift shares intel on TS7, fan theories, and her next era|url=https://ew.com/music/2019/05/09/taylor-swift-cover-story/|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=August 17, 2019|date=May 9, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190812135902/https://ew.com/music/2019/05/09/taylor-swift-cover-story/|archive-date=August 12, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> On April 13, Swift released a countdown on her official website, counting down to midnight [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] ([[UTC\u221204:00]]) on April 26.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8506993/taylor-swift-countdown-clock-april-26|title=Taylor Swift Updates Her Website With Countdown Clock, Teases April 26 Date|first=Katie|last=Atkinson|website=Billboard|date=April 13, 2019|accessdate=July 23, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190416134018/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8506993/taylor-swift-countdown-clock-april-26|archive-date=April 16, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> On April 25, several news outlets reported that a [[mural]] of a butterfly in [[The Gulch, Nashville, Tennessee|The Gulch]] neighborhood of [[Nashville, Tennessee]], painted by street artist Kelsey Montague,<ref name=\"Tennessean\">{{cite web|url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2019/04/25/taylor-swift-announcement-2019-nashville-gulch-mural/3572564002/|title=Is Taylor Swift's announcement linked to activity in Nashville's Gulch?

It was released on August 23, 2019, through [[Republic Records]]. As the [[executive producer]], Swift worked with producers [[Jack Antonoff]], [[Louis Bell]], [[Frank Dukes]] and [[Joel Little]] on the album. Described by Swift as \"a love letter to love itself\", ''Lover'' celebrates the ups and downs of love, incorporating brighter and cheerful tones, departing from the dark sounds of its predecessor, ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]'' (2017). The album's cover art and music videos marked a change in Swift's visual appearance, which now embodies a [[summer]] aesthetic, consisting mainly of [[Pastel (color)|pastel colors]]. Musically, it is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[synth-pop]], [[electropop]] and [[pop rock]] record that contains influences of [[Country music|country]], [[dream pop]], [[bubblegum pop]], [[funk]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[pop punk]] and [[indie pop]].\n\n''Lover'' features collaborations with the [[Dixie Chicks]] and [[Brendon Urie]] of [[Panic! at the Disco]]. It was preceded by three singles, all peaking inside the top 10 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]; \"[[Me!]]\" and \"[[You Need to Calm Down]]\" peaked at number two, while the [[Lover (Taylor Swift song)|title track]] reached number 10. Breaking a string of records, all 18 tracks of ''Lover'' charted simultaneously on the Hot 100 chart upon the album's release, including the fourth single \"[[The Man (Taylor Swift song)|The Man]]\" that peaked at number 23. ''Lover'' received positive reviews from critics, who commended Swift's songwriting conveying emotional maturity and growth; however, a few of them found the album lengthy and inconsistent.  \n\n''Lover'' debuted at number-one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, moving 867,000 units in its first week. It also debuted at number one in many countries including Australia, Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain and the UK. ''Lover'' was certified [[RIAA certification|double platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] for moving over 2 million units in the US; it was the best selling album of 2019 in the country.

It was released by Pikachu Records on June 10, 1998, in [[Japan]] only. This collection consists of composer [[Shinji Miyazaki]]'s orchestrated arrangements of musical compositions from the first four Pok\u00e9mon games by composer [[Junichi Masuda]] and exclusive musical cues heard throughout the first series. These instrumental tracks are categorized as sixteen chapters included with the show's first opening theme song \"Mezase Pokemon Masut\u0101\" and second closing theme \"Poketto ni Fantaj\u012b\" (both are the TV-size edits). Each of the instrumental tracks are followed by a brief commentary featuring [[Ash Ketchum|Satoshi]]'s [[Pok\u00e9dex|Pok\u00e9mon Zukan]] voiced by its voice actor [[Shin-ichiro Miki]] explaining each composition's association with the story and at what point it plays. Included with the album is a hard bound picture book (the {{nihongo|''Meibamen Sh\u016b''|\u540d\u5834\u9762\u96c6|famous  (impressive) scene collection}}), stickers, and a merchandise catalogue.\n\n====Track list====\n{{Tracklist\n| extra_column    =  Performed by\n| title1          = Mezase Pokemon Masut\u0101\n| note1           = {{Nihongo2|\u3081\u3056\u305b\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc}} ''Aim to Be a Pokemon Master''\n| music1          = Hirokazu Tanaka\n| lyrics1         = Akihito Toda\n| extra1          = [[Rika Matsumoto]]\n| length1         = 2:43\n}}\n{{Tracklist\n| headline        = Chapter.1 {{Nihongo|Pokemon!

It was released by Pikachu Records on June 10, 1998, in [[Japan]] only. This collection consists of composer [[Shinji Miyazaki]]'s orchestrated arrangements of musical compositions from the first four Pok\u00e9mon games by composer [[Junichi Masuda]] and exclusive musical cues heard throughout the first series. These instrumental tracks are categorized as sixteen chapters included with the show's first opening theme song \"Mezase Pokemon Masut\u0101\" and second closing theme \"Poketto ni Fantaj\u012b\" (both are the TV-size edits). Each of the instrumental tracks are followed by a brief commentary featuring [[Ash Ketchum|Satoshi]]'s [[Pok\u00e9dex|Pok\u00e9mon Zukan]] voiced by its voice actor [[Shin-ichiro Miki]] explaining each composition's association with the story and at what point it plays. Included with the album is a hard bound picture book (the {{nihongo|''Meibamen Sh\u016b''|\u540d\u5834\u9762\u96c6|famous  (impressive) scene collection}}), stickers, and a merchandise catalogue.\n\n====Track list====\n{{Tracklist\n| extra_column    =  Performed by\n| title1          = Mezase Pokemon Masut\u0101\n| note1           = {{Nihongo2|\u3081\u3056\u305b\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc}} ''Aim to Be a Pokemon Master''\n| music1          = Hirokazu Tanaka\n| lyrics1         = Akihito Toda\n| extra1          = [[Rika Matsumoto]]\n| length1         = 2:43\n}}\n{{Tracklist\n| headline        = Chapter.1 {{Nihongo|Pokemon!
