Of these, the Treasurer and [[Comptroller of Scotland|Comptroller]] had originated in 1425 when the [[The Great Chamberlain|Chamberlain]]'s financial functions were transferred to them.<ref>Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer, vol. 1, (1877), xiv.</ref> From 1466 the Comptroller had sole responsibility for financing the royal household to which certain revenues (the property) were appropriated, with the Treasurer being responsible for the remaining revenue (the casualty) and other expenditure.  The Collector-General, created in 1562, handled the Crown's revenue from the [[thirds of benefices]], and the Treasurer of the New Augmentation was responsible for the former church lands annexed to the Crown in 1587.\n\nAll four offices were held by the same person from 1610 onwards, but their separate titles survived the effective merging of their functions in 1635. From 1667 to 1682 the Treasury was in commission, and again from 1686 to 1708, when the separate [[Scottish Treasury]] was abolished. From 1690 the Crown nominated one person to sit in [[Parliament of Scotland|Parliament]] as Treasurer.\n\nThe '''[[Treasurer-depute]]''' was also a senior post in the pre-[[Act of Union 1707|Union]] government of Scotland. It was the equivalent of the English post of [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]].\n\nOriginally a deputy to the '''Treasurer''', the Treasurer-depute emerged as a separate Crown appointment by 1614. Its holder attended the [[Privy Council of Scotland|Privy Council]] in the absence of the Treasurer, but gained independent membership of the Council in 1587 and sat in the [[Parliament of Scotland]] as a [[Great Officer of State]] in 1593 and from 1617 onwards.\n\n== List of Treasurers ==\n\nThe following have been identified as Treasurers of Scotland.<ref>Haydn's Book of Dignities, 1851, pages 402-3.</ref>\n{| border=\"0\"\n|-\n| align=\"right\" |1420\n|Sir [[Walter Ogilvie]] of [[Lintrethan]]\n|-\n| align=\"right\" |\n|[[Thomas de Myrton]], Dean of [[Glasgow Cathedral]]\n|-\n| align=\"right\" |1430\n|[[Patrick de Ogilvie]]\n|-\n| align=\"right\" |1433\n|Walter Stewart, [[Dean of Moray]]\n|-\n| align=\"right\" |1437\n|Sir [[Walter de Haliburton, 1st Lord Haliburton of Dirleton|Walter de Haliburton]], Knt.<ref>''Genealogical Memoirs of the Family of Sir Walter Scott, Bt.'', with a reprint of the ''memorials of the Haliburtons'' by the Rev.
