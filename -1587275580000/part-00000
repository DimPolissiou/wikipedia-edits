{"title_page": "Hook grip", "text_new": "'''Hookgrip''' Is used in many strength-related sports such as Crossfit, powerlifting, strength conditioning and Olympic weightlifting. Using hook grip provides the lifter with a much more secure, tight grip it also takes the pressure off muscles in the arm, hands and wrist to reduce risk of injury. When used in the deadlift, the hook grip has a number of advantages. Traditionally, lifters tend to use a \"mixed\" grip when working with heavy loads on the deadlift, that is, one hand being supine and the other prone. This mixed grip creates an imbalance of the shoulders, with one shoulder being externally rotated and the other internally rotated. This difference in rotation between the shoulders can create imbalances in the muscles of the back over time.[[File:Hookgrip step 1.jpg|thumb|Step one: Place an open hand around the barbell with your thumb on the opposite side]]\n[[File:Hookgrip 2.jpg|thumb|Step two: Wrap your thumb around the barbell]]\n[[File:Hookgrip 3.jpg|thumb|Step three: Wrap remaining fingers over thumb and around bar]]If you don\u2019t have a secure grip on the bar, its going to be hard to lift the weights.

He was a member of the [[House of Habsburg]].\n\nRudolf's legacy has traditionally been viewed in three ways:<ref name=hotson>Hotson, 1999.</ref> an ineffectual ruler whose mistakes led directly to the [[Thirty Years' War]]; a great and influential patron of [[Northern Mannerist]] art; and an intellectual devotee of occult arts and learning which helped seed what would be called the [[scientific revolution]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[Image:Archdukerudolf.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Archduke Rudolf, aged 15, painted by [[Alonso S\u00e1nchez Coello]].]]\n\nRudolf was born in [[Vienna]] on 18 July 1552. He was the eldest son and successor of [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]], Holy Roman Emperor, King of [[Bohemia]], and King of Hungary and [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Croatia]]; his mother was [[Maria of Spain]], a daughter of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and [[Isabella of Portugal]]. He was the elder brother of [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Matthias]] who was to succeed him as king of Bohemia and Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nRudolf spent eight formative years, from age 11 to 19 (1563\u20131571), in Spain, at the court of his maternal uncle [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], together with his younger brother [[Archduke_Ernest_of_Austria|Ernest]], future governor of the [[Low Countries]].<ref>{{cite book|first1=Edgarda|last1=Ferri|title=Rodolfo II. Un imperatore nella Praga dell'arte, della scienza e dell'alchimia|year=2007|publisher=Arnoldo Mondadori Editore}}</ref> After his return to Vienna, his father was concerned about Rudolf's aloof and stiff manner, typical of the more conservative Spanish court, rather than the more relaxed and open Austrian court; but his Spanish mother saw in him courtliness and refinement.<ref name=marshall>Marshall, 2006.</ref> In the years following his return to Vienna, Rudolf was created [[King of Hungary]] (1572), [[King of Bohemia]] and [[King of the Romans]] (1575)<ref name=\"Treccani\">[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/rodolfo-ii-imperatore/ \"Rod\u00f2lfo II Imperatore\" at ''Enciclopedia Treccani'']</ref> when his father was still alive. \n\nRudolf would remain for the rest of his life reserved, secretive, and largely a recluse who did not like to travel or even partake in the daily affairs of state.<ref name=marshall/> He was more intrigued by occult learning such as astrology and alchemy, which was mainstream in the [[Renaissance]] period, and had a wide variety of personal hobbies such as horses, clocks, collecting rarities, and being a patron of the arts. He suffered from periodic bouts of \"[[Depression (mood)|melancholy]]\" (depression), which was common in the Habsburg line. These became worse with age, and were manifested by a withdrawal from the world and its affairs into his private interests.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Portrait bust of Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor, Antwerp City Hall, Belgium - 20150629-03.jpg|thumb|upright|A portrait bust of Rudolf II in the collection of the [[Antwerp City Hall]], Belgium]]\n[[File:Rudolf II, Martino Rota.jpg|thumb|250px|Portrait by Martino Rota.]]\n\nLike his near-contemporary, [[Elizabeth I of England]] (who was born 19 years before he was), Rudolf dangled himself as a prize in a string of diplomatic negotiations for marriages, but never in fact married. During his periods of self-imposed isolation, Rudolf reportedly had affairs with his court chamberlain, Wolfgang von Rumpf, and a series of valets. One of these, Philip Lang, ruled him for years and was hated by those seeking favour with the emperor.<ref name=rowse>Rowse, 1977.</ref>\n\nIn addition, Rudolf was known to have had a succession of affairs with women, some of whom claimed to have been impregnated by him.<ref name=marshall/> He had several illegitimate children with his mistress [[Catherina Strada]]. Their eldest son, [[Don Julius Caesar d'Austria]], was likely born between 1584 and 1586 and received an education and opportunities for political and social prominence from his father.<ref name=\"Don Julius D'Austria and his Fate\">{{cite web|title=Don Julius D'Austria and his Fate|url=http://www.castle.ckrumlov.cz/docs/en/zamek_oinf_dojuda.xml|publisher=State Castle and Chateau \u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov|accessdate=4 January 2013}}</ref>  In 1607, Rudolf sent Julius to live at [[\u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov]] in Bohemia (in what is now the [[Czech Republic]]), a castle which Rudolf purchased from [[Peter Vok of Rosenberg|Peter Vok/Wok von Rosenberg]], the last of the [[House of Rosenberg]], after he fell into financial ruin.  Julius lived at \u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov when in 1608 he reportedly abused and murdered the daughter of a local barber, who had been living in the castle, and then disfigured her body. Rudolf condemned his son's act and suggested that he should be imprisoned for the rest of his life.  However, Julius died in 1609 after showing signs of [[schizophrenia]], refusing to bathe, and living in squalor; his death was apparently caused by an ulcer that ruptured.<ref name=\"Don Julius D'Austria and his Fate\"/>\n\nMany artworks commissioned by Rudolf are unusually erotic.<ref>Trevor-Roper, 116-120</ref> The emperor was the subject of a whispering campaign by his enemies in his family and the [[Catholic Church]] in the years before he was deposed. Sexual allegations may well have formed a part of the campaign against him.<ref>Trevor-Roper, 121-123. Trevor-Roper mentions many stories and rumours, but not those of Rudolf's homosexuality</ref>\n\n==Reign==\nRudolf succeeded his father Maximilian II on 12 October 1576.<ref name=\"Treccani\"/> In 1583 he moved the court to Prague.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Frucht|editor-first=Richard C.|title=Eastern Europe|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-800-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/easterneuropeint0000unse/page/252 252]|url=https://archive.org/details/easterneuropeint0000unse/page/252}}</ref>\n\nHistorians have traditionally blamed Rudolf's preoccupation with the arts, occult sciences, and other personal interests as the reason for the political disasters of his reign.<ref name=hotson/> More recently historians have re-evaluated this view and see his patronage of the arts and occult sciences as a triumph and key part of the Renaissance, while his political failures are seen as a legitimate attempt to create a unified Christian empire, which was undermined by the realities of religious, political and intellectual disintegrations of the time.<ref name=hotson/>\n\n[[Image:Rudolf2c.jpg|thumb|left|[[Engraving]] by [[Aegidius Sadeler]] (1603).]]\n[[File:Martino Rota - Emperor Rudolf II in Armour - WGA20140.jpg|left|thumb|Portrait of Rudolf II as a young man by [[Martino Rota]].]]\n\nAlthough raised in his uncle's Catholic court in Spain, Rudolf was tolerant of [[Protestantism]] and other religions including [[Judaism]].<ref name=marshall/> He largely withdrew from Catholic observances, even in death refusing the last sacramental rites. He had little attachment to Protestants either, except as counter-weight to papal policies. He put his primary support behind [[conciliarist]]s, [[irenicist]]s and [[humanists]]. When the papacy instigated the [[Counter-Reformation]], using agents sent to his court, Rudolf backed those whom he thought were the most neutral in the debate, not taking a side or trying to effect restraint, thus leading to political chaos and threatening to provoke civil war.<ref name=hotson/>\n\nHis conflict with the [[Ottoman Empire]] was the final cause of his undoing. Unwilling to compromise with the Turks, and stubbornly determined that he could unify all of Christendom with a new [[Crusade]], he started a long and indecisive war with the Turks in 1593.<ref>Craft, Kimberly L. (2011) ''The Private Letters of Countess Erzs\u00e9bet B\u00e1thory'', pp. 73-74.</ref> This war lasted till 1606, and was known as \"[[Long War (Ottoman wars)|The Long War]]\".<ref name=hotson/> By 1604 his Hungarian subjects were exhausted by the war and revolted, led by [[Stephen Bocskay]] ([[Bocskai Uprising]]). In 1605 Rudolf was forced by his other family members to cede control of Hungarian affairs to his younger brother [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Matthias]]. By 1606 Matthias forged a difficult peace with the Hungarian rebels ([[Treaty of Vienna (1606)|Peace of Vienna]]) and the Turks ([[Peace of Zsitvatorok]]). Rudolf was angry with his brother's concessions, which he saw as giving away too much in order to further Matthias' hold on power. So Rudolf prepared to start a new war with the Turks. But Matthias rallied support from the disaffected Hungarians and forced Rudolf to cede the crowns of Hungary, Austria, and Moravia to him. At the same time, seeing a moment of royal weakness, Bohemian Protestants demanded greater religious liberty, which Rudolf granted in the ''[[Letter of Majesty]]'' in 1609. The Bohemians continued to press for further freedoms, and Rudolf used his army to repress them. The Bohemian Protestants then appealed to Matthias for help; Matthias' army then held Rudolf prisoner in his castle in Prague until 1611, when Rudolf ceded the crown of Bohemia to his brother.\n\n==Death==\n[[Image:Krone Kaiser Rudolf II Kaisertum \u00d6sterreich.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The [[Imperial Crown of Austria|Crown of Rudolf II]] later became the imperial crown of the [[Austrian Empire]].]]\n\n[[Image:Imperial Crown of Austria Globus cruciger Sceptre.jpg|right|thumb|Crown, scepter and globus cruciger of Rudolf II.]]\n\nRudolf died in 1612, nine months after he had been stripped of all effective power by his younger brother, except the empty title of Holy Roman Emperor, to which Matthias was elected five months later. In May 1618 with the event known as the [[Defenestration of Prague]], the Protestant Bohemians, in defence of the rights granted them in the ''Letter of Majesty'', threw imperial officials out of the window and thus the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) started.\n\n==Patronage of arts and collectionism==\nRudolf moved the Habsburg capital from Vienna to Prague in 1583. Rudolf loved collecting paintings, and was often reported to sit and stare in rapture at a new work for hours on end.<ref name=marshall/> He spared no expense in acquiring great past masterworks, such as those of [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer|D\u00fcrer]] and [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder|Brueghel]]. He was also patron to some of the best contemporary artists, who mainly produced new works in the [[Northern Mannerist]] style, such as [[Bartholomeus Spranger]], [[Hans von Aachen]], [[Giambologna]], [[Giuseppe Arcimboldo]], [[Aegidius Sadeler]], [[Roelant Savery]], and [[Adrian de Vries]], as well as commissioning works from Italians like [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]]. Rudolf's collections were the most impressive in the Europe of his day, and the greatest collection of Northern Mannerist art ever assembled.<ref name=hotson/> The adjective '''Rudolfine''', as in \"Rudolfine Mannerism\" is often used in art history to describe the style of the art he patronized.\n\nRudolf's love of collecting went far beyond paintings and sculptures. He commissioned decorative objects of all kinds and in particular mechanical moving devices. Ceremonial swords and musical instruments, clocks, water works, astrolabes, compasses, telescopes and other scientific instruments, were all produced for him by some of the best craftsmen in Europe.\n\nHe patronized [[natural philosophy|natural philosophers]] such as the botanist [[Charles de l'Ecluse]], and the astronomers [[Tycho Brahe]] and [[Johannes Kepler]] both attended his court. Tycho Brahe developed the [[Rudolphine Tables]] (finished by Kepler, after Brahe's death), the first comprehensive table of data of the movements of the planets. As mentioned before, Rudolf also attracted some of the best scientific instrument makers of the time, such as [[Jost B\u00fcrgi]], [[Erasmus Habermel]] and [[Hans Christoph Schissler]]. They had direct contact with the court astronomers and, through the financial support of the court, they were economically independent to develop scientific instruments and manufacturing techniques.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ralf|last= Kern|title= Wissenschaftliche Instrumente in ihrer Zeit/Volume 1: Vom Astrolab zum mathematischen Besteck|location= Cologne|year= 2010|pages=366 and 370}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Vertumnus \u00e5rstidernas gud m\u00e5lad av Giuseppe Arcimboldo 1591 - Skoklosters slott - 91503.tiff|thumb|200px|right|Rudolf painted as [[Vertumnus]], Roman God of the seasons, by [[Giuseppe Arcimboldo]] (1590\u20131). Rudolf greatly appreciated the work.]]\nThe poet [[Elizabeth Jane Weston]], a writer of [[Renaissance Latin]] poetry, was also part of his court and wrote numerous odes to him.\n\nRudolf kept a menagerie of exotic animals, botanical gardens, and Europe's most extensive \"[[cabinet of curiosities]]\"<ref name=marshall/> (''Kunstkammer'') incorporating \"the three kingdoms of nature and the works of man\". It was housed at [[Prague Castle]], where between 1587 and 1605 he built the northern wing to house his growing collections.<ref>Wendell E. Wilson, Joel A.

According to hearsay passed on in a letter written by [[Johannes Marcus Marci]] in 1665, Rudolf was said to have acquired the manuscript at some unspecified time for 600 gold [[ducat]]s. No evidence in support of this single piece of hearsay has ever been discovered. The [[Codex Gigas]] was also in his possessions. \n\nAs was typical of the time, Rudolf II had a portrait painted in the studio of the renowned Alonso Sanchez Coello. Completed in 1567 by Alonso Sanchez Coello, the portrait depicted Rudolf II at the age of 15. This painting can be seen at the [[Lobkowicz Palace]] in the Rozmberk room.\n[[File:Celestial globe with clockwork MET DP237684.jpg|thumb|left|Richly ornamented [[celestial globe]] with clockwork, made for the Kunstkammer of Rudolf II, 1579]]\nBy 1597, the collection occupied three rooms of the incomplete northern wing. When building was completed in 1605, the collection was moved to the dedicated ''Kunstkammer''. ''Naturalia'' ([[mineral]]s and [[gemstone]]s) were arranged in a 37 cabinet display that had three vaulted chambers in front, each about 5.5 metres wide by 3 metres high and 60 metres long, connected to a main chamber 33 metres long. Large uncut gemstones were held in strong boxes.<ref name=minhistory>{{cite book |title=The History of Mineral Collecting, 1530\u20131799 |last=Wilson |first=Wendell |editor=Wilson, Wendell |year=1994 |publisher=Mineralogical Record |url=http://www.minrec.org/bookdetail.asp?id=34 |access-date=2012-09-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130326044645/http://minrec.org/bookdetail.asp?id=34 |archive-date=2013-03-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nRudolf's ''Kunstkammer'' was not a typical \"cabinet of curiosities\" \u2013 a haphazard collection of unrelated specimens. Rather, the Rudolfine ''Kunstkammer'' was systematically arranged in an [[encyclopaedic]] fashion. In addition, Rudolf II employed his polyglot court physician, [[Anselmus de Boodt|Anselmus Boetius de Boodt]], to [[curator|curate]] the collection. [[Anselmus de Boodt|De Boodt]] was an avid mineral collector. He travelled widely on collecting trips to the [[mining]] regions of Germany, [[Bohemia]] and [[Silesia]], often accompanied by his Bohemian [[naturalist]] friend, [[Thaddaeus Hagecius]]. Between 1607 and 1611, [[Anselmus de Boodt|De Boodt]] catalogued the ''Kunstkammer'', and in 1609 he published ''Gemmarum et Lapidum'', one of the finest mineralogical treatises of the 17th century.<ref name =minhistory/>\n[[File:Praha Hoefnagel 1595 DSCN0730.JPG|thumb|240px|[[Prague Castle]] in 1595 by [[Joris Hoefnagel]].]]\n\nAs was customary at the time, the collection was private, but friends of the Emperor, artists, and professional scholars were allowed to study it. The collection became an invaluable research tool during the flowering of 17th-century European [[philosophy]], the \"[[Age of Enlightenment|Age of Reason]]\".\n\nRudolf's successors did not appreciate the collection and the ''Kunstkammer'' gradually fell into disarray. Some 50 years after its establishment, most of the collection was packed into wooden crates and moved to [[Vienna]]. The collection remaining at [[Prague]] was looted during the last year of the [[Thirty Years War]], by Swedish troops who sacked Prague Castle on 26 July 1648, also taking the best of the paintings, many of which later passed to the [[Orl\u00e9ans Collection]] after the death of [[Christina of Sweden]]. In 1782, the remainder of the collection was sold piecemeal to private parties by [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]]. One of the surviving items from the ''Kunstkammer''  is a \"fine chair\" looted by the Swedes in 1648 and now owned by the [[Earl of Radnor]] at [[Longford Castle]] in England;<ref>Hayward, J.

His lifelong quest was to find the [[Philosopher's Stone]] and Rudolf spared no expense in bringing Europe's best alchemists to court, such as [[Edward Kelley]] and [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]]. Rudolf even performed his own experiments in a private alchemy laboratory.<ref name=marshall/> When Rudolf was a prince, [[Nostradamus]] prepared a horoscope which was dedicated to him as 'Prince and King'.

He was the elder brother of [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Matthias]] who was to succeed him as king of Bohemia and Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nRudolf spent eight formative years, from age 11 to 19 (1563\u20131571), in Spain, at the court of his maternal uncle [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], together with his younger brother [[Archduke_Ernest_of_Austria|Ernest]], future governor of the [[Low Countries]].<ref>{{cite book|first1=Edgarda|last1=Ferri|title=Rodolfo II.

He suffered from periodic bouts of \"[[Depression (mood)|melancholy]]\" (depression), which was common in the Habsburg line. These became worse with age, and were manifested by a withdrawal from the world and its affairs into his private interests.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Portrait bust of Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor, Antwerp City Hall, Belgium - 20150629-03.jpg|thumb|upright|A portrait bust of Rudolf II in the collection of the [[Antwerp City Hall]], Belgium]]\n[[File:Rudolf II, Martino Rota.jpg|thumb|250px|Portrait by Martino Rota.]]\n\nLike his near-contemporary, [[Elizabeth I of England]] (who was born 19 years before he was), Rudolf dangled himself as a prize in a string of diplomatic negotiations for marriages, but never in fact married. During his periods of self-imposed isolation, Rudolf reportedly had affairs with his court chamberlain, Wolfgang von Rumpf, and a series of valets. One of these, Philip Lang, ruled him for years and was hated by those seeking favour with the emperor.<ref name=rowse>Rowse, 1977.</ref>\n\nIn addition, Rudolf was known to have had a succession of affairs with women, some of whom claimed to have been impregnated by him.<ref name=marshall/> He had several illegitimate children with his mistress [[Catherina Strada]].

Trevor-Roper mentions many stories and rumours, but not those of Rudolf's homosexuality</ref>\n\n==Reign==\nRudolf succeeded his father Maximiliam II on 12 October 1576.<ref name=\"Treccani\"/> In 1583 he moved the court to Prague.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Frucht|editor-first=Richard C.|title=Eastern Europe|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-800-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/easterneuropeint0000unse/page/252 252]|url=https://archive.org/details/easterneuropeint0000unse/page/252}}</ref>\n\nHistorians have traditionally blamed Rudolf's preoccupation with the arts, occult sciences, and other personal interests as the reason for the political disasters of his reign.<ref name=hotson/> More recently historians have re-evaluated this view and see his patronage of the arts and occult sciences as a triumph and key part of the Renaissance, while his political failures are seen as a legitimate attempt to create a unified Christian empire, which was undermined by the realities of religious, political and intellectual disintegrations of the time.<ref name=hotson/>\n\n[[Image:Rudolf2c.jpg|thumb|left|[[Engraving]] by [[Aegidius Sadeler]] (1603).]]\n[[File:Martino Rota - Emperor Rudolf II in Armour - WGA20140.jpg|left|thumb|Portrait of Rudolf II as a young man by [[Martino Rota]].]]\n\nAlthough raised in his uncle's Catholic court in Spain, Rudolf was tolerant of [[Protestantism]] and other religions including [[Judaism]].<ref name=marshall/> He largely withdrew from Catholic observances, even in death denying last sacramental rites. He had little attachment to Protestants either, except as counter-weight to papal policies. He put his primary support behind [[conciliarist]]s, [[irenicist]]s and [[humanists]]. When the papacy instigated the [[Counter-Reformation]], using agents sent to his court, Rudolf backed those who he thought were the most neutral in the debate, not taking a side or trying to effect restraint, thus leading to political chaos and threatening to provoke civil war.<ref name=hotson/>\n\nHis conflict with the [[Ottoman Empire]] was the final cause of his undoing. Unwilling to compromise with the Turks, and stubbornly determined that he could unify all of Christendom with a new [[Crusade]], he started a long and indecisive war with the Turks in 1593.<ref>Craft, Kimberly L. (2011) ''The Private Letters of Countess Erzs\u00e9bet B\u00e1thory'', pp. 73-74.</ref> This war lasted till 1606, and was known as \"[[Long War (Ottoman wars)|The Long War]]\".<ref name=hotson/> By 1604 his Hungarian subjects were exhausted by the war and revolted, led by [[Stephen Bocskay]] ([[Bocskai Uprising]]). In 1605 Rudolf was forced by his other family members to cede control of Hungarian affairs to his younger brother [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Matthias]]. Matthias by 1606 forged a difficult peace with the Hungarian rebels ([[Treaty of Vienna (1606)|Peace of Vienna]]) and the Turks ([[Peace of Zsitvatorok]]). Rudolf was angry with his brother's concessions, which he saw as giving away too much in order to further Matthias' hold on power. So Rudolf prepared to start a new war with the Turks. But Matthias rallied support from the disaffected Hungarians and forced Rudolf to cede the crowns of Hungary, Austria, and Moravia to him. At the same time, seeing a moment of royal weakness, Bohemian Protestants demanded greater religious liberty, which Rudolf granted in the ''[[Letter of Majesty]]'' in 1609. The Bohemians continued to press for further freedoms, and Rudolf used his army to repress them. The Bohemian Protestants then appealed to Matthias for help; Matthias' army then held Rudolf prisoner in his castle in Prague, until 1611, when Rudolf ceded the crown of Bohemia to his brother.\n\n==Death==\n[[Image:Krone Kaiser Rudolf II Kaisertum \u00d6sterreich.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The [[Imperial Crown of Austria|Crown of Rudolf II]] later became the imperial crown of the [[Austrian Empire]].]]\n\n[[Image:Imperial Crown of Austria Globus cruciger Sceptre.jpg|right|thumb|Crown, scepter and globus cruciger of Rudolf II.]]\n\nRudolf died in 1612, nine months after he had been stripped of all effective power by his younger brother, except the empty title of Holy Roman Emperor, to which Matthias was elected five months later. In May 1618 with the event known as the [[Defenestration of Prague]], the Protestant Bohemians, in defence of the rights granted them in the ''Letter of Majesty'', threw imperial officials out of the window and thus the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) started.\n\n==Patronage of arts and collectionism==\nRudolf moved the Habsburg capital from Vienna to Prague in 1583. Rudolf loved collecting paintings, and was often reported to sit and stare in rapture at a new work for hours on end.<ref name=marshall/> He spared no expense in acquiring great past masterworks, such as those of [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer|D\u00fcrer]] and [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder|Brueghel]]. He was also patron to some of the best contemporary artists, who mainly produced new works in the [[Northern Mannerist]] style, such as [[Bartholomeus Spranger]], [[Hans von Aachen]], [[Giambologna]], [[Giuseppe Arcimboldo]], [[Aegidius Sadeler]], [[Roelant Savery]], and [[Adrian de Vries]], as well as commissioning works from Italians like [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]]. Rudolf's collections were the most impressive in the Europe of his day, and the greatest collection of Northern Mannerist art ever assembled.<ref name=hotson/> The adjective '''Rudolfine''', as in \"Rudolfine Mannerism\" is often used in art history to describe the style of the art he patronized.\n\nRudolf's love of collecting went far beyond paintings and sculptures. He commissioned decorative objects of all kinds and in particular mechanical moving devices. Ceremonial swords and musical instruments, clocks, water works, astrolabes, compasses, telescopes and other scientific instruments, were all produced for him by some of the best craftsmen in Europe.\n\nHe patronized [[natural philosophy|natural philosophers]] such as the botanist [[Charles de l'Ecluse]], and the astronomers [[Tycho Brahe]] and [[Johannes Kepler]] both attended his court. Tycho Brahe developed the [[Rudolphine Tables]] (finished by Kepler, after Brahe's death), the first comprehensive table of data of the movements of the planets. As mentioned before, Rudolf also attracted some of the best scientific instrument makers of the time, such as [[Jost B\u00fcrgi]], [[Erasmus Habermel]] and [[Hans Christoph Schissler]]. They had direct contact with the court astronomers and, through the financial support of the court, they were economically independent to develop scientific instruments and manufacturing techniques.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ralf|last= Kern|title= Wissenschaftliche Instrumente in ihrer Zeit/Volume 1: Vom Astrolab zum mathematischen Besteck|location= Cologne|year= 2010|pages=366 and 370}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Vertumnus \u00e5rstidernas gud m\u00e5lad av Giuseppe Arcimboldo 1591 - Skoklosters slott - 91503.tiff|thumb|200px|right|Rudolf painted as [[Vertumnus]], Roman God of the seasons, by [[Giuseppe Arcimboldo]] (1590\u20131). Rudolf greatly appreciated the work.]]\nThe poet [[Elizabeth Jane Weston]], a writer of [[Renaissance Latin]] poetry, was also part of his court and wrote numerous odes to him.\n\nRudolf kept a menagerie of exotic animals, botanical gardens, and Europe's most extensive \"[[cabinet of curiosities]]\"<ref name=marshall/> (''Kunstkammer'') incorporating \"the three kingdoms of nature and the works of man\". It was housed at [[Prague Castle]], where between 1587 and 1605 he built the northern wing to house his growing collections.<ref>Wendell E. Wilson, Joel A.

According to hearsay passed on in a letter written by [[Johannes Marcus Marci]] in 1665, Rudolf was said to have acquired the manuscript at some unspecified time for 600 gold [[ducat]]s. No evidence in support of this single piece of hearsay has ever been discovered. The [[Codex Gigas]] was also in his possessions. \n\nAs was typical of the time, Rudolf II had a portrait painted in the studio of the renowned Alonso Sanchez Coello. Completed in 1567 by Alonso Sanchez Coello, the portrait depicted Rudolf II at the age of 15. This painting can be seen at the [[Lobkowicz Palace]] in the Rozmberk room.\n[[File:Celestial globe with clockwork MET DP237684.jpg|thumb|left|Richly ornamented [[celestial globe]] with clockwork, made for the Kunstkammer of Rudolf II, 1579]]\nBy 1597, the collection occupied three rooms of the incomplete northern wing. When building was completed in 1605, the collection was moved to the dedicated ''Kunstkammer''. ''Naturalia'' ([[mineral]]s and [[gemstone]]s) were arranged in a 37 cabinet display that had three vaulted chambers in front, each about 5.5 metres wide by 3 metres high and 60 metres long, connected to a main chamber 33 metres long. Large uncut gemstones were held in strong boxes.<ref name=minhistory>{{cite book |title=The History of Mineral Collecting, 1530\u20131799 |last=Wilson |first=Wendell |editor=Wilson, Wendell |year=1994 |publisher=Mineralogical Record |url=http://www.minrec.org/bookdetail.asp?id=34 |access-date=2012-09-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130326044645/http://minrec.org/bookdetail.asp?id=34 |archive-date=2013-03-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nRudolf's ''Kunstkammer'' was not a typical \"cabinet of curiosities\" \u2013 a haphazard collection of unrelated specimens. Rather, the Rudolfine ''Kunstkammer'' was systematically arranged in an [[encyclopaedic]] fashion. In addition, Rudolf II employed his polyglot court physician, [[Anselmus de Boodt|Anselmus Boetius de Boodt]], to [[curator|curate]] the collection. [[Anselmus de Boodt|De Boodt]] was an avid mineral collector. He travelled widely on collecting trips to the [[mining]] regions of Germany, [[Bohemia]] and [[Silesia]], often accompanied by his Bohemian [[naturalist]] friend, [[Thaddaeus Hagecius]]. Between 1607 and 1611, [[Anselmus de Boodt|De Boodt]] catalogued the ''Kunstkammer'', and in 1609 he published ''Gemmarum et Lapidum'', one of the finest mineralogical treatises of the 17th century.<ref name =minhistory/>\n[[File:Praha Hoefnagel 1595 DSCN0730.JPG|thumb|240px|[[Prague Castle]] in 1595 by [[Joris Hoefnagel]].]]\n\nAs was customary at the time, the collection was private, but friends of the Emperor, artists, and professional scholars were allowed to study it. The collection became an invaluable research tool during the flowering of 17th-century European [[philosophy]], the \"[[Age of Enlightenment|Age of Reason]]\".\n\nRudolf's successors did not appreciate the collection and the ''Kunstkammer'' gradually fell into disarray. Some 50 years after its establishment, most of the collection was packed into wooden crates and moved to [[Vienna]]. The collection remaining at [[Prague]] was looted during the last year of the [[Thirty Years War]], by Swedish troops who sacked Prague Castle on 26 July 1648, also taking the best of the paintings, many of which later passed to the [[Orl\u00e9ans Collection]] after the death of [[Christina of Sweden]]. In 1782, the remainder of the collection was sold piecemeal to private parties by [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]]. One of the surviving items from the ''Kunstkammer''  is a \"fine chair\" looted by the Swedes in 1648 and now owned by the [[Earl of Radnor]] at [[Longford Castle]] in England;<ref>Hayward, J.

His lifelong quest was to find the [[Philosopher's Stone]] and Rudolf spared no expense in bringing Europe's best alchemists to court, such as [[Edward Kelley]] and [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]]. Rudolf even performed his own experiments in a private alchemy laboratory.<ref name=marshall/> When Rudolf was a prince, [[Nostradamus]] prepared a horoscope which was dedicated to him as 'Prince and King'.

The company also owns [[All-Nippon News Network]].\n\n==Headquarters==\n[[File:Tv asahi.jpg|thumb|Sign of TV asahi in headquarters since 2003]]\nIn 2003, the company headquarters moved to a new building designed by [[Fumihiko Maki]] at: 6-9-1 [[Roppongi]], [[Minato, Tokyo]], Japan.\n\nSome of TV Asahi's departments and subsidiaries, such as TV Asahi Productions and Take Systems, are still located at ''TV Asahi Center'', the company's former headquarters of 1986\u20132003. It is located at [[Ark Hills]], not far from its headquarters.\n[[File:View of TV Asahi.jpg|thumb|View of TV Asahi headquarters since 2003]]\n\n==History==\n[[Image:TVAsahi.jpg|thumb|TV Asahi's annexe at Ark Hills, not far from its headquarters since 2003]]\n\nTV Asahi began as {{nihongo|\"Nihon Educational Television Co., Ltd.\" (NET)|\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\u65e5\u672c\u6559\u80b2\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3|Kabushiki-gaisha Nihon Ky\u014diku Terebi|extra=\"The Japanese Educational Television Company\"}} on November 1, 1957. It was established as a for-profit educational television channel. At the time, its broadcasting license dictates that the network is required to devote at least 50% of its airtime to educational programming, and at least 30% of its airtime to children's educational programming. The station was owned by [[Asahi Shimbun]], [[Toei Company]], [[Nihon Keizai Shimbun]], and Obunsha.\n\nHowever, the for-profit educational television model eventually proved to be a failure. In 1960, NET began its transformation into a general-purpose television station. It began to broadcast [[anime]] and foreign movies. So as not to run afoul of the educational TV license requirements, NET justified the airing of these programs under the pretext of {{nihongo|\"nurturing a child's emotional range\"|\u5b50\u4f9b\u306e\u60c5\u64cd\u6559\u80b2\u306e\u305f\u3081|Kodomo no j\u014ds\u014d ky\u014diku no tame}} and {{nihongo|\"introduction of foreign cultures\"|\u5916\u56fd\u6587\u5316\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb|Gaikoku bunka no sh\u014dkai}}. At the same time, NET also changed its common name from \"Nihon Educational Television\" to \"NET TV\" (NET\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3).\n\nSeven years later, in 1967, NET aired its first colour broadcast programme. Part of its transformation into a general TV channel would be the April 1971 premiere of the [[Kamen Rider Series]] by the Toei Company and creator [[Shotaro Ishinomori]], the [[tokusatsu]] [[superhero]] series that would make the channel a national hit. It has been its home ever since, joined by yet another toku series, ''[[Super Sentai]]'', in the spring of 1975 (KR left the channel in 1975, only to return in 2000). Aside from these two live action programs, which would become part of its flagship programming, due in part by the work done by Toei's animation branch, the 70s were also marked on NET with great animation classics of national fame, which aired one after the other in the channel and were even exported to other countries, many of these would be part of daily life and culture and helped introduce the world to the [[anime]] genre. Such animations put the channel in direct competition with other stations which broadcast similar programming.\n\nNET's transformation into a general-purpose television station was complete by November 1973, when NET, along with educational channel \"Tokyo Channel 12\" (now [[TV Tokyo]]) in [[Tokyo]] applied and received a general purpose television station license. At the same time, NET renamed itself as NET General Television (\u7dcf\u5408\u5c40NET), which subsequently became the {{Nihongo|\"Asahi National Broadcasting Company, Limited\"|\u5168\u56fd\u671d\u65e5\u653e\u9001\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e|Zenkoku Asahi H\u014ds\u014d Kabushiki-gaisha|extra=commonly named \"TV Asahi\"}} on April 1, 1977. Five years later, TV Asahi became the official network, until 1999, for yet another Toei live action franchise, the [[Metal Hero Series]].\n\nIn 1996, TV Asahi established the {{Nihongo|'''All-Nippon News Network (ANN)'''|\u30aa\u30fc\u30eb\u30cb\u30c3\u30dd\u30f3\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u30fb\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af|\u014cru Nippon Ny\u016bsu Nettow\u0101ku}}, and began a number of reforms, including the unification of all presentation styles on its regional networks and the creation of a new logo to give Asahi the look and feel of a national television network. On October 1, 2003, TV Asahi moved its head office from its Ark Hills Studio to [[Roppongi Hills]], and the station was renamed \"TV Asahi Corporation\", with the name presented as \"tv asahi\" on-screen.\n\nThe transmission of international aquatics competitions, World Cup football matches, and creation of popular late-night TV programs contributed to a rise in ratings for TV Asahi, and lifted the TV station from its popularly ridiculed \"perpetual fourth place\" finish into second place, right behind [[fuji Television|Fuji TV]], by 2005.\n\nThe station also launched its own [[mascot]], {{Nihongo|''G\u014d EX Panda''|\u30b4\u30fc\u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30d1\u30f3\u30c0|G\u014d Ekkusu Panda}}, also known as {{Nihongo|''G\u014d-chan''|\u30b4\u30fc\u3061\u3083\u3093\u3002}} G\u014d-chan is currently seen on TV Asahi's opening sign-on ID.\n\n==Branding==\nTV Asahi's current branding were created by UK design collective [[Tomato (design collective)|Tomato]] (some members work as the electronic music group [[Underworld (band)|Underworld]]) along with TV Asahi's in-house design department in 2003. It comprises a set of computer-generated \"sticks\" in white background, which changes in colour and movement along with the background music that accompanies the idents. TV Asahi also uses a brief [[eyecatch]] of its sticks animation at the top-left of the screen after commercial breaks. The background music used for TV Asahi's sign-on and sign-off videos are Underworld's ''[[Born Slippy .NUXX#Born Slippy .NUXX 2003|Born Slippy .NUXX 2003]]'' and ''Rez''. TV Asahi later updated its sign-on and sign-off video in 2008 with a revised version of computer-generated \"sticks\" animation and new background music. TV Asahi's slogan ''New Air, On Air'' appears at the top of its name. It can be seen on TV Asahi's YouTube channel, which in 2011-12, was replaced by its mascot, Go-Chan.\n\nThe company writes its name in lower-case letters, ''tv asahi'', in its logo and public-image materials. Normally, the station branding on-screen appears as either \"/tv asahi\" or \"tv asahi\\\". The station's watermark appearance is the stick at the top with the station's name at the bottom.

The company also owns [[All-Nippon News Network]].\n\n==Headquarters==\n[[File:Tv asahi.jpg|thumb|Sign of TV asahi in headquarters since 2003]]\nIn 2003, the company headquarters moved to a new building designed by [[Fumihiko Maki]] at: 6-9-1 [[Roppongi]], [[Minato, Tokyo]], Japan.\n\nSome of TV Asahi's departments and subsidiaries, such as TV Asahi Productions and Take Systems, are still located at ''TV Asahi Center'', the company's former headquarters of 1986\u20132003. It is located at [[Ark Hills]], not far from its headquarters.\n[[File:View of TV Asahi.jpg|thumb|View of TV Asahi headquarters since 2003]]\n\n==History==\n[[Image:TVAsahi.jpg|thumb|TV Asahi's annexe at Ark Hills, not far from its headquarters since 2003]]\n\nTV Asahi began as {{nihongo|\"Nihon Educational Television Co., Ltd.\" (NET)|\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\u65e5\u672c\u6559\u80b2\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3|Kabushiki-gaisha Nihon Ky\u014diku Terebi|extra=\"The Japanese Educational Television Company\"}} on November 1, 1957. It was established as a for-profit educational television channel. At the time, its broadcasting license dictates that the network is required to devote at least 50% of its airtime to educational programming, and at least 30% of its airtime to children's educational programming. The station was owned by [[Asahi Shimbun]], [[Toei Company]], [[Nihon Keizai Shimbun]], and Obunsha.\n\nHowever, the for-profit educational television model eventually proved to be a failure. In 1960, NET began its transformation into a general-purpose television station. It began to broadcast [[anime]] and foreign movies. So as not to run afoul of the educational TV license requirements, NET justified the airing of these programs under the pretext of {{nihongo|\"nurturing a child's emotional range\"|\u5b50\u4f9b\u306e\u60c5\u64cd\u6559\u80b2\u306e\u305f\u3081|Kodomo no j\u014ds\u014d ky\u014diku no tame}} and {{nihongo|\"introduction of foreign cultures\"|\u5916\u56fd\u6587\u5316\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb|Gaikoku bunka no sh\u014dkai}}. At the same time, NET also changed its common name from \"Nihon Educational Television\" to \"NET TV\" (NET\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3).\n\nSeven years later, in 1967, NET aired its first colour broadcast programme. Part of its transformation into a general TV channel would be the April 1971 premiere of the [[Kamen Rider Series]] by the Toei Company and creator [[Shotaro Ishinomori]], the [[tokusatsu]] [[superhero]] series that would make the channel a national hit. It has been its home ever since, joined by yet another toku series, ''[[Super Sentai]]'', in the spring of 1975 (KR left the channel in 1975, only to return in 2000). Aside from these two live action programs, which would become part of its flagship programming, due in part by the work done by Toei's animation branch, the 70s were also marked on NET with great animation classics of national fame, which aired one after the other in the channel and were even exported to other countries, many of these would be part of daily life and culture and helped introduce the world to the [[anime]] genre. Such animations put the channel in direct competition with other stations which broadcast similar programming.\n\nNET's transformation into a general-purpose television station was complete by November 1973, when NET, along with educational channel \"Tokyo Channel 12\" (now [[TV Tokyo]]) in [[Tokyo]] applied and received a general purpose television station license. At the same time, NET renamed itself as NET General Television (\u7dcf\u5408\u5c40NET), which subsequently became the {{Nihongo|\"Asahi National Broadcasting Company, Limited\"|\u5168\u56fd\u671d\u65e5\u653e\u9001\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e|Zenkoku Asahi H\u014ds\u014d Kabushiki-gaisha|extra=commonly named \"TV Asahi\"}} on April 1, 1977. Five years later, TV Asahi became the official network, until 1999, for yet another Toei live action franchise, the [[Metal Hero Series]].\n\nIn 1996, TV Asahi established the {{Nihongo|'''All-Nippon News Network (ANN)'''|\u30aa\u30fc\u30eb\u30cb\u30c3\u30dd\u30f3\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u30fb\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af|\u014cru Nippon Ny\u016bsu Nettow\u0101ku}}, and began a number of reforms, including the unification of all presentation styles on its regional networks and the creation of a new logo to give Asahi the look and feel of a national television network. On October 1, 2003, TV Asahi moved its head office from its Ark Hills Studio to [[Roppongi Hills]], and the station was renamed \"TV Asahi Corporation\", with the name presented as \"tv asahi\" on-screen.\n\nThe transmission of international aquatics competitions, World Cup football matches, and creation of popular late-night TV programs contributed to a rise in ratings for TV Asahi, and lifted the TV station from its popularly ridiculed \"perpetual fourth place\" finish into second place, right behind [[fuji Television|Fuji TV]], by 2005.\n\nThe station also launched its own [[mascot]], {{Nihongo|''G\u014d EX Panda''|\u30b4\u30fc\u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30d1\u30f3\u30c0|G\u014d Ekkusu Panda}}, also known as {{Nihongo|''G\u014d-chan''|\u30b4\u30fc\u3061\u3083\u3093\u3002}} G\u014d-chan is currently seen on TV Asahi's opening sign-on ID.\n\n==Branding==\nTV Asahi's current branding were created by UK design collective [[Tomato (design collective)|Tomato]] (some members work as the electronic music group [[Underworld (band)|Underworld]]) along with TV Asahi's in-house design department in 2003. It comprises a set of computer-generated \"sticks\" in white background, which changes in colour and movement along with the background music that accompanies the idents. TV Asahi also uses a brief [[eyecatch]] of its sticks animation at the top-left of the screen after commercial breaks. The background music used for TV Asahi's sign-on and sign-off videos are Underworld's ''[[Born Slippy .NUXX#Born Slippy .NUXX 2003|Born Slippy .NUXX 2003]]'' and ''Rez''. TV Asahi later updated its sign-on and sign-off video in 2008 with a revised version of computer-generated \"sticks\" animation and new background music. TV Asahi's slogan ''New Air, On Air'' appears at the top of its name. It can be seen on TV Asahi's YouTube channel, which in 2011-12, was replaced by its mascot, Go-Chan.\n\nThe company writes its name in lower-case letters, ''tv asahi'', in its logo and public-image materials. Normally, the station branding on-screen appears as either \"/tv asahi\" or \"tv asahi\\\". The station's watermark appearance is the stick at the top with the station's name at the bottom. The fonts used by TV Asahi for the written parts are [[Akzidenz Grotesk|Akzidenz Grotesk Bold]] (English) and [[Hiragino|Hiragino Kaku Gothic W8]] (Japanese).<ref>http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/vi/flash_content/index.html http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/vi/flash_content/index.html</ref>\n\n==TV broadcasting==\nSince 2004, the funding of this station is through [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]].\n{{Infobox broadcast\n| call_letters             = JOEX-TV<br>JOEX-DTV\n| station_logo             = TV Asahi Logo.svg\n| station_slogan           = ''New Air, On Air.''<br>(2008-present)\n| station_branding         = tv asahi<br />\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u671d\u65e5<br />''EX''\n| digital                  = JOEX-DTV, Channel 24 ([[UHF]] \u2013 [[Virtual channel|LCN]] 5)\n| other_chs                = '''[[Hachi\u014dji, Tokyo]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 45<br />\n'''[[Tama, Tokyo]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 57<br />\n'''[[Chichi-jima|Chichi-jima, Ogasawara Islands]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 59<br />\n'''[[Mito, Ibaraki]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 36<br />Digital: Channel 17<br />\n'''[[Hitachi, Ibaraki]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 60<br />\n'''[[Utsunomiya, Tochigi]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 41<br />Digital: Channel 17<br />\n'''[[Maebashi, Gunma]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 60<br />Digital: Channel 43<br />\n'''[[Chichibu, Saitama]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 38<br />\n'''[[Narita, Chiba]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 59<br />\n'''[[Tateyama, Chiba]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 60<br />\n'''[[Minato Mirai 21|Yokohama Minato Mirai 21, Kanagawa]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 60<br />\n'''[[Yokosuka, Kanagawa|Yokosuka-Kurihama, Kanagawa]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 35<br />\n'''[[Hiratsuka, Kanagawa]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 41<br />Digital: Channel 24<br />\n'''[[Kitadait\u014d, Okinawa]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 48<br />\n'''[[Minami Daito, Okinawa]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 60\n| affiliations             = [[All-Nippon News Network]]\n| founded                  = {{start date and age|1957}}\n| airdate                  = November 1, 1957\n| location                 = [[Kant\u014d region|Kant\u014d Region, Japan]]\n| callsign_meaning         = JOEX = '''J'''apan's'''O'''riginal Free-to-Air '''E'''ducational TV Station<br>'''X''' (10, former channel assignment)\n| sister_stations          = '''BS Asahi'''<br>'''Tele Asa Channel 1'''<br>'''Tele Asa Channel 2'''<br>'''Zee Asahi''' \n| former_callsigns         = \n| owner                    = TV Asahi Corporation\n| former_channel_numbers   = ch.# 10 ([[analog television|analog]], 1957-2011), ch. #5 ([[digital television|digital]])\n| former_affiliations      = \n| effective_radiated_power = 10 kW (68 kW [[Effective radiated power|ERP]])\n| HAAT                     = \n| class                    = \n| facility_id              = \n| coordinates              = {{Coord|35|39|31|N|139|44|44|E|type:landmark_scale:2000}}\n| homepage                 = http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/\n}}\n\n===Analog===\n\n(until July 24, 2011 only for 44 out of 47 prefectures)\n\n'''JOEX-TV''' \u2013 TV Asahi Analog Television (\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u671d\u65e5\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3)\n* [[Tokyo Tower]] \u2013 VHF Channel 10\n;

He appeared in a total of 11 films directed by Bergman, among which were ''[[The Virgin Spring]]'' (1960) and ''[[Through a Glass Darkly (film)|Through a Glass Darkly]]'' (1961), both winners of the [[Academy Award for Best International Feature Film|Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]].

Macedonia is the largest and {{nowrap|second-most-populous}} Greek region, with a population of 2.38 million in 2017. The region is highly [[mountain]]ous, with most major urban centers such as [[Thessaloniki]] and [[Kavala]] being concentrated on its southern coastline. Together with [[Western Thrace|Thrace]], and sometimes also [[Thessaly]] and [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], it is part of [[Northern Greece]]. Greek Macedonia encompasses entirely the southern part of the [[region of Macedonia]],<ref>Roy E. H. Mellor, ''Eastern Europe: A Geography of the Comecon Countries'', Macmillan International Higher Education, 1975, {{ISBN|1349155594}}, p. 62.</ref> making up 51% of the total area of the region. It also contains [[Mount Athos]], an autonomous monastic region of Greece. Macedonia forms part of Greece's [[border|national frontier]] with three countries: [[Bulgaria]] to the northeast, [[North Macedonia]] to the north, and [[Albania]] to the northwest.\n\nMacedonia incorporates most of the territories of ancient [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]], a kingdom ruled by the [[Argead Dynasty|Argeads]], whose most celebrated members were [[Alexander the Great]] and his father [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]]. The name ''Macedonia'' was later applied to a number of widely-differing administrative areas in the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] empires, resulting in [[Macedonia (region)|modern geographical Macedonia]]. Even prior to the establishment of the modern Greek state in 1830 Macedonia was identified as a Greek province, albeit without clearly defined geographical borders.<ref name=\"Etairia Makedonikon Spoudon 1\">{{cite book |last1=Grigoriou |first1= Alexandros Ch. |last2=Chekimoglou |first2= Evangelos A. |script-title=el:\u0397 \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b7\u03b3\u03b7\u03c4\u03ce\u03bd 1430\u20131930 |trans-title=The Thessaloniki of Explorers 1430\u20131930 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=p6vdPgAACAAJ&dq=%CE%97+%CE%98%CE%B5%CF%83%CF%83%CE%B1%CE%BB%CE%BF%CE%BD%CE%AF%CE%BA%CE%B7+%CF%84%CF%89%CE%BD+%CE%A0%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%B9%CE%B7%CE%B3%CE%B7%CF%84%CF%8E%CE%BD |accessdate=2 August 2011 |year=2008 |publisher=\u0395\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u039c\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd \u03a3\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03b4\u03ce\u03bd |location=Thessaloniki |language=Greek |isbn=978-960-7265-91-3 |page=43 |quote=From Robert de Dreux's personal journals, 1669: Leaving a village named Baicui, we reached Thessaloniki, which is one of the most splendid cities of Macedonia and the whole of Greece.}}</ref><ref>\"The whole of Greece is divided into four great pashaliks; Tripolizza, Egripo or Neropont, Yanina, and Salonica.

It continued as an administrative subdivision of Greece until the administrative reform of 1987, when it was divided into the regions of [[Western Macedonia]], [[Central Macedonia]], and part of the region of [[Eastern Macedonia and Thrace]], the latter containing also the whole Greek part of the region of Thrace.<ref>\u03a0.\u0394. 51/87 \"\u039a\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03ce\u03bd \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03a7\u03ce\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf \u03c3\u03c7\u03b5\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc \u03ba.\u03bb.\u03c0. \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u0391\u03bd\u03ac\u03c0\u03c4\u03c5\u03be\u03b7\u03c2\" (''Determination of the Regions of the Country for the planning etc. of the development of the regions, [[Efimeris tis Kyverniseos]] \u03a6\u0395\u039a A 26/06.03.1987</ref>\n\nThe region remains an important economic centre for Greece.

The earliest signs of human habitation date back to the [[palaeolithic]] period, notably with the [[Petralona cave]] in which was found the oldest yet known European humanoid, ''[[Archanthropus europaeus petraloniensis]]''. In the [[Late Neolithic]] period (c.&nbsp;4500 to 3500&nbsp;BC), trade took place with quite distant regions, indicating rapid socio-economic changes. One of the most important innovations was the start of copper working.\n\n===Ancient history===\n{{details|Macedonia (ancient kingdom)}}\n[[File:ExpansionOfMacedon.jpg|thumb|The expansion of the ancient Macedonian Kingdom up to the death of [[Philip II of Macedon|Phillip II]]]]\n[[File:Amfipoli, Greece - panoramio (3).jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Lion of Amphipolis]]; erected in 4th BC in honour of [[Laomedon of Mytilene]], general of Alexander the Great]]\n\nAccording to [[Herodotus]], the history of Macedonia began with the [[Ancient Macedonians|Makednoi]] tribe, among the first to use the name, migrating to the region from [[Histiaeotis]] in the south. There they lived near Thracian tribes such as the [[Bryges]] who would later leave Macedonia for [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] and become known as [[Phrygia]]ns. ''[[Macedonia (terminology)#Etymology|Macedonia]]'' was named after the Makednoi. Accounts of other [[toponym]]s such as [[Imathia|Emathia]] are attested to have been in use before that. Herodotus claims that\na branch of the Macedonians invaded Southern Greece towards the end of the second millennium B.C. Upon reaching the Peloponnese the invaders were renamed [[Dorians]], triggering the accounts of the Dorian invasion. For centuries the Macedonian tribes were organized in independent kingdoms, in what is now Central Macedonia, and their role in internal Hellenic politics was minimal, even before the rise of Athens. The Macedonians claimed to be Dorian Greeks (Argive Greeks) and there were many [[Ionians]] in the coastal regions. The rest of the region was inhabited by various Thracian and Illyrian tribes as well as mostly coastal colonies of other Greek states such as [[Amphipolis]], Olynthos, Potidea, Stageira and many others, and to the north another tribe dwelt, called the [[Paeonians]]. During the late 6th and early 5th century BC, the region came under Persian rule until the destruction of Xerxes at [[Plataea]]. During the [[Peloponnesian War]], Macedonia became the theatre of many military actions by the [[Peloponnesian League]] and the Athenians, and saw incursions of Thracians and Illyrians, as attested by Thucydides. Many Macedonian cities were allied to the Spartans (both the Spartans and the Macedonians were Dorian, while the Athenians were Ionian), but Athens maintained the colony of Amphipolis under her control for many years. The kingdom of [[Macedon]], was reorganized by [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] and achieved the union of Greek states by forming the [[League of Corinth]]. After his assassination, his son [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] succeeded to the throne of Macedon and carrying the title of [[Hegemon]] of [[League of Corinth]] started his [[Wars of Alexander the Great|long campaign]] towards the east.\n\n===Roman period===\n{{See also|Macedonian Wars|Macedonia (Roman province)}}\n[[File:\u0391\u03a8\u0399\u0394\u0391 \u0393\u0391\u039b\u0395\u03a1\u0399\u039f\u03a5 2.jpg|thumb|View of the Roman-era [[Arch of Galerius and Rotunda|Arch of Galerius]] in Thessaloniki, capital of Roman Macedonia]]\n\nMacedonia remained an important and powerful kingdom until the [[Battle of Pydna]] (June 22, 168 BC), in which the Roman general [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus|Aemilius Paulus]] defeated King [[Perseus of Macedon]], ending the reign of the [[Antigonid dynasty]] over Macedonia. For a brief period a Macedonian republic called the \"Koinon of the Macedonians\" was established. It was divided into four administrative districts by the Romans in the hope that this would make revolts more difficult, but this manoeuvre failed. Then in 148 BC, Macedonia was fully annexed by the Romans.<ref name=\"Moutsopoulos\">N. K.

The passage reports that Paul and his companions responded immediately to the invitation.\n\nSubsequently the provinces of [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]] and [[Thessaly]] as well as other regions to the north were incorporated into a new Provincia Macedonia, but in 297 AD under a [[Diocletian]]ic reform many of these regions were removed and two new provinces were created: Macedonia Prima and Macedonia Salutaris (from 479 to 482 AD Macedonia Secunda). Macedonia Prima coincided approximately with Strabo's definition of Macedonia and with the modern administrative district of Greece<ref name=\"Moutsopoulos\" /> and had [[Thessalonica|Thessaloniki]] as its capital, while Macedonia Salutaris had the [[Paeonia (kingdom)|Paeonian]] city of [[Stobi]] (near [[Gradsko, North Macedonia|Gradsko]]) as its capital. This subdivision is mentioned in [[Hierocles of Alexandria|Hierocles]]' Synecdemon (527\u2013528) and remained through the reign of emperor [[Justinian]].\n\nThe [[Slav]]ic, [[Pannonian Avars|Avar]], [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] and [[Hungarian people|Magyar]] invasions in the 6\u20137th centuries devastated both provinces<ref>{{cite book |first=John Julius |last=Norwich |title=A short history of Byzantium |publisher=Penguin |year=1998 }}</ref> with only parts of Macedonia Prima in the coastal areas and nearer [[Western Thrace|Thrace]] remaining in [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] hands, while most of the hinterland was disputed between the [[Byzantine empire|Byzantium]] and [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]]. The Macedonian regions under Byzantine control passed under the [[tourma]] of Macedonia to the province of [[Thrace]].\n\nA new system of administration came into place in 789\u2013802 AD, following the [[Byzantine empire]]'s recovery from these invasions. The new system was based on administrative divisions called [[Themata]]. The region of Macedonia Prima (the territory of modern Greek administrative district of Macedonia) was divided between the Thema of Thessaloniki and the Thema of Strymon, so that only the region of the area from [[Nestos (river)|Nestos]] eastwards continued to carry the name Macedonia, referred to as the [[Macedonia (theme)|Thema of Macedonia]] or the Thema of \"Macedonia in Thrace\".

It was subdued by the co-founder of the Greek [[Despotate of Epirus]], [[Theodore Komnenos Doukas]] in 1224, when Greek Macedonia and the city of [[Thessaloniki]] were at the heart of the short-lived [[Empire of Thessalonica]]. Returning to the restored [[Byzantine Empire]] shortly thereafter, Greek Macedonia remained in Byzantine hands until the 1340s, when all of Macedonia (except Thessaloniki, and possibly [[Veria]]) was conquered by the Serbian ruler [[Stephen Uro\u0161 IV Du\u0161an of Serbia|Stefan Du\u0161an]].<ref>Fine, ''The Late Medieval Balkans'', 301&ndash;302</ref> Divided between Serbia and [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] after Du\u0161an's death, the region fell quickly to the advancing [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], with Thessaloniki alone holding out until 1387.

While most of Macedonia was ruled by the Ottomans, in [[Mount Athos]] the monastic community continued to exist in a state of autonomy. The remainder of the [[Chalkidiki]] peninsula also enjoyed an autonomous status: the \"Koinon of Mademochoria\" was governed by a locally appointed council due to privileges obtained on account of its wealth, coming from the gold and silver mines in the area.\n\nThere were several uprisings in Macedonia during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]], including an uprising after the [[Battle of Lepanto]] that ended in massacres of the Greek population, the uprising in [[Naousa, Imathia|Naousa]] of the armatolos [[Zisis Karademos]] in 1705, a rebellion in the area of [[Grevena]] by a [[Klepht]] called Ziakas (1730\u20131810) and the Greek Declaration of Independence in Macedonia by [[Emmanouel Pappas|Emmanuel Pappas]] in 1821, during the [[Greek War of Independence]]. In 1854 [[Theodoros Ziakas]], the son of the klepht Ziakas, together with [[Dimitrios Karatasos]], who had been among  the captains at the siege of [[Naousa, Imathia|Naousa]] in 1821, led another uprising in Western Macedonia that has been profusely commemorated in Greek folk song.\n\n===Modern history===\n{{Main|Greek War of Independence|Greek Struggle for Macedonia|Balkan Wars|Macedonian Front|Movement of National Defence}}\n[[File:1st Battalion of the National Defence army marches for the front.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|The 1st Battalion of the [[Provisional Government of National Defence|National Defence]] marches on its way to the Front, during WWI.]]\n\nGreece gained the southern parts of the region with Thessaloniki from the [[Ottoman Empire]] after the [[First Balkan War]], and expanded its share in the [[Second Balkan War]] against Bulgaria. The boundaries of Greek Macedonia were finalized in the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]]. In [[World War I]], Macedonia became a battlefield. The Greek Prime Minister, [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], favoured entering the war on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]], while the Germanophile King [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I]] favored neutrality. Invited by Venizelos, in autumn 1915, the Allies landed forces in Thessaloniki to aid [[Serbia]] in [[Serbian Campaign (World War I)|its war]] against Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria, but their intervention came too late to prevent the Serbian collapse. The [[Macedonian front]] was established, with Thessaloniki at its heart, while in summer 1916 the Bulgarians [[Struma operation|took over]] Greek eastern Macedonia without opposition. This provoked a military uprising among pro-Venizelist officers in Thessaloniki, resulting in the establishment of a \"[[Provisional Government of National Defence]]\" in the city, headed by Venizelos, which entered the war alongside the Allies. After intense diplomatic negotiations and an [[Noemvriana|armed confrontation]] in Athens between Entente and royalist forces the King abdicated, and his second son [[Alexander of Greece|Alexander]] took his place. Venizelos returned to Athens in June 1917 and Greece, now unified, officially joined the war on the side of the Allies.\n\nIn [[World War II]] Macedonia was [[Axis occupation of Greece|occupied by the Axis]] (1941\u201344), with Germany taking western and central Macedonia with Thessaloniki and Bulgaria occupying and annexing eastern Macedonia.\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, Slavic peasants identified themselves based on belonging to their family, village, or local region, or as \"[[Rum Millet]]\", i.e. members of the Greek-dominated community of Orthodox Christians. The Slavs of Macedonia generally referred to themselves and were known as \"Bulgarians\", but the word \"Bulgarian\" invoked the idea of a poor, Slav-speaking peasant.  By the middle of the 19th century, peasant communities of Macedonia experienced the formation of deep divisions with [[rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire]]. From then, the [[Slavic speakers in Ottoman Macedonia|Slavic speaking communities of northern Greece]] split into two hostile and opposed groups with two different national identities - Greek and Bulgarian.<ref>Gounaris, Basil G.

Conservatives departed with the occupying Bulgarian Army to Bulgaria. Leftists who identified as Macedonians (Slavic), joined the communist-dominated rebel [[Democratic Army of Greece]].

The earliest signs of human habitation date back to the [[palaeolithic]] period, notably with the [[Petralona cave]] in which was found the oldest yet known European humanoid, ''[[Archanthropus europaeus petraloniensis]]''. In the [[Late Neolithic]] period (c.&nbsp;4500 to 3500&nbsp;BC), trade took place with quite distant regions, indicating rapid socio-economic changes. One of the most important innovations was the start of copper working.\n\n===Ancient history===\n{{details|Macedonia (ancient kingdom)}}\n[[File:ExpansionOfMacedon.jpg|thumb|The expansion of the ancient Macedonian Kingdom up to the death of [[Philip II of Macedon|Phillip II]]]]\n[[File:Amfipoli, Greece - panoramio (3).jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Lion of Amphipolis]]; erected in 4th BC in honour of [[Laomedon of Mytilene]], general of Alexander the Great]]\n\nAccording to [[Herodotus]], the history of Macedonia began with the [[Ancient Macedonians|Makednoi]] tribe, among the first to use the name, migrating to the region from [[Histiaeotis]] in the south. There they lived near Thracian tribes such as the [[Bryges]] who would later leave Macedonia for [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] and become known as [[Phrygia]]ns. ''[[Macedonia (terminology)#Etymology|Macedonia]]'' was named after the Makednoi. Accounts of other [[toponym]]s such as [[Imathia|Emathia]] are attested to have been in use before that. Herodotus claims that\na branch of the Macedonians invaded Southern Greece towards the end of the second millennium B.C. Upon reaching the Peloponnese the invaders were renamed [[Dorians]], triggering the accounts of the Dorian invasion. For centuries the Macedonian tribes were organized in independent kingdoms, in what is now Central Macedonia, and their role in internal Hellenic politics was minimal, even before the rise of Athens. The Macedonians claimed to be Dorian Greeks (Argive Greeks) and there were many [[Ionians]] in the coastal regions. The rest of the region was inhabited by various Thracian and Illyrian tribes as well as mostly coastal colonies of other Greek states such as [[Amphipolis]], Olynthos, Potidea, Stageira and many others, and to the north another tribe dwelt, called the [[Paeonians]]. During the late 6th and early 5th century BC, the region came under Persian rule until the destruction of Xerxes at [[Plataea]]. During the [[Peloponnesian War]], Macedonia became the theatre of many military actions by the [[Peloponnesian League]] and the Athenians, and saw incursions of Thracians and Illyrians, as attested by Thucydides. Many Macedonian cities were allied to the Spartans (both the Spartans and the Macedonians were Dorian, while the Athenians were Ionian), but Athens maintained the colony of Amphipolis under her control for many years. The kingdom of [[Macedon]], was reorganized by [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] and achieved the union of Greek states by forming the [[League of Corinth]]. After his assassination, his son [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] succeeded to the throne of Macedon and carrying the title of [[Hegemon]] of [[League of Corinth]] started his [[Wars of Alexander the Great|long campaign]] towards the east.\n\n===Roman period===\n{{See also|Macedonian Wars|Macedonia (Roman province)}}\n[[File:\u0391\u03a8\u0399\u0394\u0391 \u0393\u0391\u039b\u0395\u03a1\u0399\u039f\u03a5 2.jpg|thumb|View of the Roman-era [[Arch of Galerius and Rotunda|Arch of Galerius]] in Thessaloniki, capital of Roman Macedonia]]\n\nMacedonia remained an important and powerful kingdom until the [[Battle of Pydna]] (June 22, 168 BC), in which the Roman general [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus|Aemilius Paulus]] defeated King [[Perseus of Macedon]], ending the reign of the [[Antigonid dynasty]] over Macedonia. For a brief period a Macedonian republic called the \"Koinon of the Macedonians\" was established. It was divided into four administrative districts by the Romans in the hope that this would make revolts more difficult, but this manoeuvre failed.

Therefore ancient Macedonia did not significantly extend beyond its current borders (in Greece).

The passage reports that Paul and his companions responded immediately to the invitation.\n\nSubsequently the provinces of [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]] and [[Thessaly]] as well as other regions to the north were incorporated into a new Provincia Macedonia, but in 297 AD under a [[Diocletian]]ic reform many of these regions were removed and two new provinces were created: Macedonia Prima and Macedonia Salutaris (from 479 to 482 AD Macedonia Secunda). Macedonia Prima coincided approximately with Strabo's definition of Macedonia and with the modern administrative district of Greece<ref name=\"Moutsopoulos\" /> and had [[Thessalonica|Thessaloniki]] as its capital, while Macedonia Salutaris had the [[Paeonia (kingdom)|Paeonian]] city of [[Stobi]] (near [[Gradsko, North Macedonia|Gradsko]]) as its capital. This subdivision is mentioned in [[Hierocles of Alexandria|Hierocles]]' Synecdemon (527\u2013528) and remained through the reign of emperor [[Justinian]].\n\nThe [[Slav]]ic, [[Pannonian Avars|Avar]], [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] and [[Hungarian people|Magyar]] invasions in the 6\u20137th centuries devastated both provinces<ref>{{cite book |first=John Julius |last=Norwich |title=A short history of Byzantium |publisher=Penguin |year=1998 }}</ref> with only parts of Macedonia Prima in the coastal areas and nearer [[Western Thrace|Thrace]] remaining in [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] hands, while most of the hinterland was disputed between the [[Byzantine empire|Byzantium]] and [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]]. The Macedonian regions under Byzantine control passed under the [[tourma]] of Macedonia to the province of [[Thrace]].\n\nA new system of administration came into place in 789\u2013802 AD, following the [[Byzantine empire]]'s recovery from these invasions.

Following the campaigns of [[Basil II]], all of Macedonia returned to the Byzantine state. Following the [[Fourth Crusade]] 1203&ndash;1204, a short-lived [[Crusader states|Crusader]] realm, the [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]], was established in the region. It was subdued by the co-founder of the Greek [[Despotate of Epirus]], [[Theodore Komnenos Doukas]] in 1224, when Greek Macedonia and the city of [[Thessaloniki]] were at the heart of the short-lived [[Empire of Thessalonica]]. Returning to the restored [[Byzantine Empire]] shortly thereafter, Greek Macedonia remained in Byzantine hands until the 1340s, when all of Macedonia (except Thessaloniki, and possibly [[Veria]]) was conquered by the Serbian ruler [[Stephen Uro\u0161 IV Du\u0161an of Serbia|Stefan Du\u0161an]].<ref>Fine, ''The Late Medieval Balkans'', 301&ndash;302</ref> Divided between Serbia and [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] after Du\u0161an's death, the region fell quickly to the advancing [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], with Thessaloniki alone holding out until 1387.

The memory of the event has survived through folk traditions containing fact and myths. Apostolos Vacalopoulos records the following Turkish tradition connected with the capture of Thessaloniki:<ref>Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia 1354&ndash;1833'', [http://www.promacedonia.org/en/av/av_3_4.htm 97]</ref>\n{{quote|\"While [[Murad II|Murad]] was asleep in his palace at Yenitsa, the story has it that, God appeared to him in a dream and gave him a lovely rose to smell, full of perfume. The sultan was so amazed by its beauty that he begged God to give it to him. God replied, \"This rose, Murad, is Thessalonica. Know that it is to you granted by heaven to enjoy it. Do not waste time; go and take it\". Complying with this exhortation from, Murad marched against Thessalonica and, as it has been written, captured it.\"}}\n\n[[Thessaloniki]] became a centre of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] administration in the Balkans. While most of Macedonia was ruled by the Ottomans, in [[Mount Athos]] the monastic community continued to exist in a state of autonomy. The remainder of the [[Chalkidiki]] peninsula also enjoyed an autonomous status: the \"Koinon of Mademochoria\" was governed by a locally appointed council due to privileges obtained on account of its wealth, coming from the gold and silver mines in the area.\n\nThere were several uprisings in Macedonia during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]], including an uprising after the [[Battle of Lepanto]] that ended in massacres of the Greek population, the uprising in [[Naousa, Imathia|Naousa]] of the armatolos [[Zisis Karademos]] in 1705, a rebellion in the area of [[Grevena]] by a [[Klepht]] called Ziakas (1730\u20131810) and the Greek Declaration of Independence in Macedonia by [[Emmanouel Pappas|Emmanuel Pappas]] in 1821, during the [[Greek War of Independence]]. In 1854 [[Theodoros Ziakas]], the son of the klepht Ziakas, together with [[Dimitrios Karatasos]], who had been among  the captains at the siege of [[Naousa, Imathia|Naousa]] in 1821, led another uprising in Western Macedonia that has been profusely commemorated in Greek folk song.\n\n===Modern history===\n{{Main|Greek War of Independence|Greek Struggle for Macedonia|Balkan Wars|Macedonian Front|Movement of National Defence}}\n[[File:1st Battalion of the National Defence army marches for the front.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|The 1st Battalion of the [[Provisional Government of National Defence|National Defence]] marches on its way to the Front, during WWI.]]\n\nGreece gained the southern parts of the region with Thessaloniki from the [[Ottoman Empire]] after the [[First Balkan War]], and expanded its share in the [[Second Balkan War]] against Bulgaria. The boundaries of Greek Macedonia were finalized in the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]]. In [[World War I]], Macedonia became a battlefield. The Greek Prime Minister, [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], favoured entering the war on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]], while the Germanophile King [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I]] favored neutrality. Invited by Venizelos, in autumn 1915, the Allies landed forces in Thessaloniki to aid [[Serbia]] in [[Serbian Campaign (World War I)|its war]] against Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria, but their intervention came too late to prevent the Serbian collapse. The [[Macedonian front]] was established, with Thessaloniki at its heart, while in summer 1916 the Bulgarians [[Struma operation|took over]] Greek eastern Macedonia without opposition. This provoked a military uprising among pro-Venizelist officers in Thessaloniki, resulting in the establishment of a \"[[Provisional Government of National Defence]]\" in the city, headed by Venizelos, which entered the war alongside the Allies. After intense diplomatic negotiations and an [[Noemvriana|armed confrontation]] in Athens between Entente and royalist forces the King abdicated, and his second son [[Alexander of Greece|Alexander]] took his place. Venizelos returned to Athens in June 1917 and Greece, now unified, officially joined the war on the side of the Allies.\n\nIn [[World War II]] Macedonia was [[Axis occupation of Greece|occupied by the Axis]] (1941\u201344), with Germany taking western and central Macedonia with Thessaloniki and Bulgaria occupying and annexing eastern Macedonia.\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, Slavic peasants identified themselves based on belonging to their family, village, or local region, or as \"[[Rum Millet]]\", i.e. members of the Greek-dominated community of Orthodox Christians. The Slavs of Macedonia generally referred to themselves and were known as \"Bulgarians\", but the word \"Bulgarian\" invoked the idea of a poor, Slav-speaking peasant.  By the middle of the 19th century, peasant communities of Macedonia experienced the formation of deep divisions with [[rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire]]. From then, the [[Slavic speakers in Ottoman Macedonia|Slavic speaking communities of northern Greece]] split into two hostile and opposed groups with two different national identities - Greek and Bulgarian.<ref>Gounaris, Basil G. (1995). \"Social Cleavages and National \"Awakening\" in Ottoman Macedonia\". East European Quarterly. 29 (4): 409\u2013426.</ref> By the Second World War and following the defeat of Bulgaria, another further split between the Slavic groups occurred. Conservatives departed with the occupying Bulgarian Army to Bulgaria. Leftists who identified as Macedonians (Slavic), joined the communist-dominated rebel [[Democratic Army of Greece]]. At the conclusion of the [[Greek Civil War]] (1946\u201349), most Macedonians of Slavic background were evacuated by the [[Greek Communist Party]] and forced to flee to the [[Socialist Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]] and other countries in Eastern and Central Europe.<ref>cite web|https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Areas/North-Macedonia/Macedonian-Refugee-Children-Exodus-Anniversary-42415|cite-title=Macedonian Refugee Children: Exodus Anniversary|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/2019*/https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Areas/North-Macedonia/Macedonian-Refugee-Children-Exodus-Anniversary-42415</ref> Some also immigrated to [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and the [[United States]].<ref>Panayiotis Diamadis et al.

When it reached the area as planned, at 15:53 [[Eastern European Summer Time|local time]] (12:53&nbsp;UTC), [[Dnipropetrovsk]] Air Control (''Dnipro Control'') asked MH17 if they could climb to FL 350 as planned, and also to avoid a potential [[Conflict (air traffic control)|separation conflict]] with another flight, [[Singapore Airlines]] Flight 351 (SQ351), also at FL 330.

This request was also approved by ''Dnipro Control'' [[Air traffic control|ATC]].

At 16:19 local time (13:19 UTC), ''Dnipro Control'' noticed that the flight was {{convert|3.6|nmi|km}} north of the centreline of approved airway and instructed MH17 to return to the track. At 16:19 local time (13:19&nbsp;UTC), ''Dnipro Control'' contacted Russian ATC in [[Rostov-on-Don]] (''RND Control'') by telephone and requested clearance to transfer the flight to Russian [[airspace]]. After obtaining the permission, ''Dnipro Control'' attempted to contact MH17 for handing them off to ''RND Control'' at 16:20 local time (13:20&nbsp;UTC), but the aircraft did not respond. When MH17 did not respond to several calls, ''Dnipro Control'' contacted ''RND Control'' again to check if they could see the aircraft on their radar.

When it reached the area as planned, at 15:53 [[Eastern European Summer Time|local time]] (12:53&nbsp;UTC), [[Dnipropetrovsk]] Air Control (''Dnipro Control'') asked MH17 if they could climb to FL 350 as planned, and also to avoid a potential [[Conflict (air traffic control)|separation conflict]] with another flight, [[Singapore Airlines]] Flight 351 (SQ351), also at FL 330.

This request was also approved by ''Dnipro Control'' [[Air traffic control|ATC]].

At 16:19 local time (13:19 UTC), ''Dnipro Control'' noticed that the flight was {{convert|3.6|nmi|km}} north of the centreline of approved airway and instructed MH17 to return to the track. At 16:19 local time (13:19&nbsp;UTC), ''Dnipro Control'' contacted Russian ATC in [[Rostov-on-Don]] (''RND Control'') by telephone and requested clearance to transfer the flight to Russian [[airspace]]. After obtaining the permission, ''Dnipro Control'' attempted to contact MH17 for handing them off to ''RND Control'' at 16:20 local time (13:20&nbsp;UTC), but the aircraft did not respond. When MH17 did not respond to several calls, ''Dnipro Control'' contacted ''RND Control'' again to check if they could see the aircraft on their radar.

The researchers investigated the prevalence of this internal experience by interviewing a sample of 150 high-achieving women. All of the participants had been formally recognized for their professional excellence by colleagues, and had displayed academic achievement through degrees earned and standardized testing scores. Despite the consistent evidence of external validation, these women lacked the internal acknowledgement of their accomplishments. The participants explained how their success was a result of luck, and others simply overestimating their intelligence and abilities. Clance and Imes believed that this mental framework for impostor phenomenon developed from factors such as: [[gender stereotypes]], early family dynamics, culture, and [[Attribution (psychology)|attribution]] style. The researchers determined that the women who experienced impostor phenomenon showcased symptoms related to [[Depression (mood)|depression]], generalized [[anxiety]], and low [[self-confidence]].\n\nClance and Imes stated in their 1978 article that, based on their clinical experience, impostor phenomenon was less prevalent in men. They noted that further research was necessary to determine the effects impostor phenomenon has on men.<ref name=Clance1978/> Following the publication in 1978, more research has determined that this experience occurs in demographics outside of just high-achieving, successful women.<ref name=\"Langford19932\"/>\n\n== Prevalence ==\nIn more current research, impostor phenomenon is studied as a reaction to particular [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] and events. It is a phenomenon (an experience) that occurs in an individual, not a [[mental disorder]]. \n\nImpostor phenomenon is not recognized in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] or [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems|ICD]], although both of these classification systems recognize low self-esteem and sense of failure as associated symptoms of depression.<ref>American Psychiatric Association (2000a).

The scale can be utilized to determine if characteristics of fear are present, and to what extent. The aspects of fear include: fear of evaluation, fear of not continuing success and fear of not being as capable as others.<ref name=Hoang2013>{{Cite journal|last=Hoang|first=Queena|date=January 2013|title=The Impostor Phenomenon: Overcoming Internalized Barriers and Recognizing Achievements|url=|journal=The Vermont Connection|volume= 34, Article 6.|pages=|via=http://scholarworks.uvm.edu/tvc/vol34/iss1/6}}</ref>\n\nIn her 1985 paper, Clance explained that impostor phenomenon can be distinguished by the following six dimensions:<ref name=Sakulku2011>{{Cite journal|last1=Sakulku|first1=J.|last2=Alexander|first2=J.|date=2011|title=The Impostor Phenomenon|url=https://www.tci-thaijo.org/index.php/IJBS/article/view/521|journal=International Journal of Behavioral Science|volume= 6|pages=73\u201392|doi=10.14456/ijbs.2011.6}}</ref>\n\n* The impostor cycle\n* The need to be special or the best\n* Characteristics of superman/superwoman\n* Fear of failure\n* Denial of ability and discounting praise\n* Feeling fear and guilt about success\n\nClance noted that the characteristics of these six dimensions may vary. By this model, for an individual to be considered to experience impostorism, at least two of these aspects have to be present. Clance theorised that the most important aspect to understand the manifestation of this experience can be seen through the ''impostor cycle'' she created.<ref name=Clance1978/>\n\n===Five types===\nBuilding upon decades of research, Valerie Young further looked into fraudulent feelings among high achievers. From her book ''The Secret Thoughts of Successful Women: Why Capable People Suffer From the Imposter Syndrome and How to Thrive in Spite of It'', she was able to identify five subgroups this syndrome often falls into.\n\n* The perfectionist\n\n* The superwoman/man\n\n* The natural genius\n\n* The soloist\n\n* The expert\n\nStudies suggest that more than 70% of people experience the impostor syndrome at some point in their career. By identifying the above competency point,  steps can be taken towards addressing it.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.themuse.com/advice/5-different-types-of-imposter-syndrome-and-5-ways-to-battle-each-one|title=5 Types of Imposter Syndrome and How to Stop Them|website=The Muse}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://impostorsyndrome.com/5-types-of-impostors/|title=The 5 Types of Impostors:|date=December 6, 2011|website=Impostor Syndrome}}</ref>\n\n=== The impostor cycle ===\n\nThe impostor cycle, as defined by Clance, begins with an achievement-related task. An example of an achievement-related task could be an exercise that was assigned through work or school. Once one has received an assignment, feelings of anxiety, [[self-doubt]], and worry immediately follow. The cycle accounts for two possible reactions that stem from these feelings. One will respond either by over-preparation or by [[procrastination]].\n\nIf one responds with procrastination, this initial response will turn into a frantic effort to complete the job. Once the task has been completed, there will be a brief period of accomplishment and feeling of relief. If positive feedback is given once the work has been completed and turned in, one will discount the positive feedback.\n\nIf one responded to the task with over-preparation, the successful outcome will be seen as a result of hard work. If one responds by procrastination, one will view the outcome as a matter of luck. In the impostor cycle, gaining success through hard work or luck is not interpreted as a matter of true, personal ability. This means that it does not matter which mechanism one used to complete the task. Even if the outcome results in a positive response, the feedback given has no effect on one's perception of personal success. This leads one to discount positive feedback.\n\nThis sequence of events serves as a [[Reinforcement (psychology)|reinforcement]], causing the cycle to remain in motion. With every cycle, feelings of perceived fraudulence, increased self-doubt, depression, and anxiety accumulate. As the cycle continues, increased success leads to the intensification of feeling like a fraud. This experience causes one to remain haunted by one's lack of perceived personal ability. Believing that at any point one can be 'exposed' for who one thinks one really is keeps the cycle in motion.<ref name=Clance1978/>\n\n=== Gender studies ===\n\nStudies on impostor phenomenon have received mixed reviews regarding the presence of impostor phenomenon in men and women.<ref name=Sakulku2011/> Clance and Imes investigated this experience in high achieving women in their 1978 study.<ref name=Clance1978/> Following the publication of this study, researchers have investigated impostor phenomenon in both men and women. Clance and Imes suggested that this experience manifests in women more than in men.<ref name=Clance1978/> \n\nA study in 2006 looked at gender differences when exploring a possible relationship between the feeling of being an impostor and the achievement of goals. The researchers concluded that the women who participated in this study experienced impostor phenomenon more so than the men who participated.<ref name=Kumar2006/> Other research has shown that women commonly face impostor phenomenon in regard to performance. The perception of ability and power is evidenced in out-performing others. For men, impostor phenomenon is often driven by the fear of being unsuccessful, or not good enough.<ref name=Royse2010>{{Cite journal|last=Royse Roskowki|first=Jane C.|date=2010|title=Impostor Phenomenon and Counselling Self-Efficacy: The Impact of Impostor Feelings|url=|journal=Ball State University|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Despite these differences, there is a significant amount of literature on impostor phenomenon and gender differences stating that it is spread equally among men and women.<ref name=Royse2010/>\n\n=== Among women of color in academia ===\nResearch findings suggest that impostor syndrome/phenomenon affects women of color mentally and academically. A pattern in the research literature shows that women report experiencing impostor phenomenon more frequently than men. Women of color also often are afflicted with impostor syndrome in elite universities.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Darlene G.|last2=Kastberg|first2=Signe M.|date=September 1995|title=Of blue collars and ivory towers: Women from blue\u2010collar backgrounds in higher education|journal=Roeper Review|volume=18|issue=1|pages=27\u201333|doi=10.1080/02783199509553693|issn=0278-3193}}</ref> Research stated that though men do experience doubt and lack of belonging in [[academia]], being a woman and a person of color in the United States means being susceptible to encountering \"hideous forms of racism and sexism\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Walton|first=Gregory M.|last2=Cohen|first2=Geoffrey L.|date=2007|title=A question of belonging: Race, social fit, and achievement|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=92|issue=1|pages=82\u201396|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.92.1.82|issn=1939-1315|citeseerx=10.1.1.320.7960|pmid=17201544}}</ref> Therefore, these experiences of racism and sexism amplify the likelihood that women of color might experience impostor phenomenon.\n\nThe intersection of race and gender for women of color in academia is important because both identities can heavily impact women of color and their academic experience, especially if their identities are visible. For example, a black woman in higher education might fear she will be stereotyped as aggressive or angry if she expresses a controversial opinion in class. According to Miller and Kastberg, both explicit and subtle forms of racism and sexism make it much more difficult for women of color to break through the barriers of higher education.<ref name=\":0\" /> Another example: explicit racist policies{{Which|date=September 2019}} that exclude Asian American women{{Dubious|Explicit Racist policies (in the USA)?|date=September 2019}} suggest that they do not experience academic barriers. Therefore, these women may not feel as though they are allowed to ask for help.{{Citation needed|reason=This statement is made in a generic way, and could be made for anyone. A link to a study is needed.|date=September 2019}} \n\nStudies on impostor phenomenon have shown that the [[Intersectionality|intersecting]] identities of women of color in academia affect identity development and goal achievement.  For example, Ostrove (2003) found that women of color from lower- and middle-class backgrounds reported feeling more alienated from their peers during their time spent at an elite college.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ostrove|first=Joan M.|date=December 2003|title=Belonging and Wanting: Meanings of Social Class Background for Women's Constructions of their College Experiences|journal=Journal of Social Issues|volume=59|issue=4|pages=771\u2013784|doi=10.1046/j.0022-4537.2003.00089.x|issn=0022-4537}}</ref> Similarly, Walton and Cohen's (2007) work on the effects of racial underrepresentation at elite private universities shows that women of color who experience [[social alienation]] in academia could easily experience impostor syndrome.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nCommon causes of impostor phenomenon include feelings such as [[social stigma|stigma]], [[stereotype threat]], or an overall sense of \"intellectual phoniness\". For example, a woman attending a predominately white institution is likely to worry that her accomplishments are not good enough relative to her peers\u2019 accomplishments. These thoughts could derive from feeling that she was accepted into a university because of affirmative action or by \"accident\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Attewell|first=Paul|last2=Domina|first2=Thurston|date=January 2011|title=Educational imposters and fake degrees|journal=Research in Social Stratification and Mobility|volume=29|issue=1|pages=57\u201369|doi=10.1016/j.rssm.2010.12.004|issn=0276-5624}}</ref>\n\n== Occurrence ==\nThe feeling of being a fraud that surfaces in impostor phenomenon is not uncommon. It has been estimated that nearly 70% of individuals will experience signs and symptoms of impostor phenomenon at least once in their life.<ref name=Ravindran>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theopennotebook.com/2016/11/15/feeling-like-a-fraud-the-impostor-phenomenon-in-science-writing/|title=Feeling Like A Fraud: The Impostor Phenomenon in Science Writing|last=Ravindran|first=Sandeep|date=November 15, 2016|website=The Open Notebook|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}</ref> This can be a result of a new academic or professional setting. Research shows that impostor phenomenon is not uncommon for students who enter a new academic environment. Feelings of insecurity can come as a result of an unknown, new environment. This can lead to lower self-confidence and belief in their own abilities.<ref name=Hoang2013/>\n\n=== Settings ===\nImpostor phenomenon can occur in other various settings. Some examples include:\n* A new environment<ref name=Sakulku2011/>\n* Academic settings<ref name=Clance1978/>\n* In the workplace<ref name=Clance1978/>\n* Social interactions<ref name=Hoang2013/>\n* Relationships (platonic or romantic)<ref name=Hoang2013/>\n\nIn relationships, people with impostorism often feel they do not live up to the expectations of their friends or loved ones. It is common for the individual with impostorism to think that they must have somehow tricked others into liking them and wanting to spend time with them. They experience feelings of being unworthy, or of not deserving the beneficial relationships they possess.<ref name=Hoang2013/>\n\nThere is empirical evidence that demonstrates the harmful effects of impostor phenomenon in students. Studies have shown that when a student's academic self-concept increases, the symptoms of impostor phenomenon decrease, and vice versa.<ref name=Royse2010/> The worry and emotions the students held, had a direct impact of their performance in the program.\n\nCommon facets of impostor phenomenon in the class-room include:<ref name=Hoang2013/>\n\n* Students compared themselves to their class-mates<ref name=Sakulku2011/>\n* Students did not feel prepared academically when they compared themselves to their class-mates<ref name=Sakulku2011/>\n* Students often questioned the grounds on which they were accepted into the program<ref name=Hoang2013/>\n* Students perceived that positive recognition, awards, and good grades stemmed from external factors, not from personal ability or intelligence.<ref name=Hoang2013/>\n\nCokley et al. investigated the impact impostor phenomenon has on students, specifically ethnic minority students. They found that the feelings the students had of being fraudulent resulted in psychological distress. Ethnic minority students often questioned the grounds on which they were accepted into the program. They held the false assumption that they only received their acceptance due to affirmative action\u2014rather than an extraordinary application and qualities they had to offer.<ref name=Cokley>{{Cite journal |last=Cokley |first=Kevin |first2=Shannon |last2=McClain |first3=Alicia |last3=Enciso |first4=Mercedes |last4=Martinez |display-authors=1 |date=2013 |title=An Examination of the Impact of Minority Status Stress and Impostor Feelings on the Mental Health of Diverse Ethnic Minority College Students|doi=10.1002/j.2161-1912.2013.00029.x |journal=Journal of Multicultural Counseling and Development|volume= 41 |issue=2 |pages=82\u201395 }}</ref>\n\n=== Connections ===\nResearch has shown that there is a relationship between impostor phenomenon and the following factors:\n\n* Family expectations<ref name=Hoang2013/>\n* Overprotective parent(s) or legal guardian(s)<ref name=Ravindran/>\n* Graduate-level coursework<ref name=Hoang2013/>\n* Racial identities<ref name=Hoang2013/>\n* Attribution style<ref name=Royse2010/>\n* Anxiety<ref name=Royse2010/>\n* Depression<ref name=Royse2010/>\n* Low trait self-esteem<ref name=Royse2010/>\n* Perfectionism<ref name=Clance1978/>\n* Excessive self-monitoring, with an emphasis on self-worth<ref name=Sakulku2011/>\n\nThe aspects listed are not mutually exclusive. These components are often found to correlate among individuals with impostor phenomenon. It is incorrect to infer that the correlational relationship between these aspects cause the impostor experience.<ref name=Hoang2013/>\n\nIn individuals with impostor phenomenon, feelings of guilt often result in a fear of success. The following are examples of common notions that lead to feelings of guilt and reinforce the phenomenon.<ref name=Kumar2006>{{Cite journal|last1=Kumar|first1=S.|last2=Jagacinski|first2=C.M.|year=2006|title=Impostors have goals too: The impostor phenomenon and its relationship to achievement goal theory.|url=|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=40|number=1|pages=147\u2013157|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2005.05.014}}</ref>\n\n* The good education they were able to receive\n* Being acknowledged by others for success\n* Belief that it is not right or fair to be in a better situation than a friend or loved one\n* Being referred to as:<ref name=Hoang2013/>\n** \"The smart one\"\n** \"The talented one\"\n** \"The responsible one\"\n** \"The sensitive one\"\n** \"The good one\"\n** \"Our favorite\"\n\n==Management==\nIn their 1978 paper, Clance and Imes proposed a therapeutic approach they used for their participants or clients with impostor phenomenon. This technique includes a group setting where various individuals meet others who are also living with this experience. The researchers explained that group meetings made a significant impact on their participants. They proposed that it was the realization that they were not the only ones who experienced these feelings. The participants were required to complete various homework assignments as well. In one assignment, participants recalled all of the people they believed they had fooled or tricked in the past. In another take-home task, individuals wrote down the positive feedback they had received. Later, they would have to recall why they received this feedback and what about it made them perceive it in a negative light. In the group sessions, the researchers also had the participants re-frame common thoughts and ideas about performance. An example would be to change: \"I might fail this exam\" to \"I will do well on this exam\".<ref name=Clance1978/>\n\nThe researchers concluded that simply extracting the self-doubt before an event occurs helps eliminate feelings of impostorism.<ref name=Clance1978/> It was recommended that the individuals struggling with this experience seek support from friends and family. Although impostor phenomenon is not a mental condition, it can still affect an individual strongly.<ref name=Ravindran/>\n\nOther research on therapeutic approaches for impostorism emphasizes the importance of self-worth. Individuals who live with impostor phenomenon commonly relate self-esteem and self-worth to others. A major aspect of other therapeutic approaches for impostor phenomenon focus on separating the two into completely separate entities.<ref name=Royse2010/>\n\nIn a study in 2013, researcher Queena Hoang proposed that intrinsic motivation can decrease the feelings of being a fraud that are common in impostor phenomenon.<ref name=Hoang2013/> This includes a series of re-framing current ideas. The following are examples listed in Hoang's 2013 paper:\n\n* \"I want to receive that degree. I won't give up and have too much pride to walk away.\"\n* \"If I can do this, I will be able to help others in the future and work with people as motivated as I am.\"\n* \"I can be the voice of other People of Color who do not have the opportunities like I do.\"\n* \"I know I can do this.\"\n* Learning how to \"be your own person.\"\n* Learning how to accept and believe compliments.\n\nHoang also suggested that implementing a mentor program for new or entering students will minimize students' feelings of self-doubt. Having a mentor who has been in the program will help the new students feel supported. This allows for a much smoother and less overwhelming transition.\n\nImpostor experience can be addressed with many kinds of [[psychotherapy]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Matthews |first1=Gail |last2=Clance |first2=Pauline Rose |date=February 1985 |title=Treatment of the impostor phenomenon in psychotherapy clients |journal=Psychotherapy in Private Practice |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=71\u201381 |doi=10.1300/J294v03n01_09}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Leahy |first=Robert L. |date=2005 |chapter=Work worries: What if I really mess up? |title=The worry cure: seven steps to stop worry from stopping you |location=New York |publisher=[[Harmony Books]] |pages=273\u2013290 (274) |isbn=978-1400097654 |oclc=57531355}} Discusses treatment of impostor syndrome with [[cognitive therapy]].</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Harris |first=Russ |date=2011 |title=The confidence gap: a guide to overcoming fear and self-doubt |location=Boston |publisher=Trumpeter |isbn=9781590309230 |oclc=694394371}} Discusses treatment of impostor syndrome with [[acceptance and commitment therapy]].</ref> [[Group psychotherapy]] is an especially common and effective way of alleviating the impostor experience.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Clance |first1=Pauline Rose |last2=Dingman |first2=Debbara |last3=Reviere |first3=Susan L. |last4=Stober |first4=Dianne R. |date=June 1995 |title=Impostor phenomenon in an interpersonal/social context |journal=[[Women & Therapy]] |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=79\u201396 (87) |doi=10.1300/J015v16n04_07 |quote=One of the most exciting and effective treatment modalities for women struggling with the impostor phenomenon is group psychotherapy.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Lowman |first=Rodney L. |date=1993 |chapter=Fear of success and fear of failure |title=Counseling and psychotherapy of work dysfunctions |location=Washington, DC |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |pages=[https://archive.org/details/counselingpsycho00lowmrich/page/74 74\u201382 (81)] |isbn=978-1557982049 |oclc=27812757 |doi=10.1037/10133-004 |quote=Group treatment programs have reported positive results in lowering FOF [fear of failure] (Rajendran & Kaliappan, 1990).

The researchers investigated the prevalence of this internal experience by interviewing a sample of 150 high-achieving women. All of the participants had been formally recognized for their professional excellence by colleagues, and had displayed academic achievement through degrees earned and standardized testing scores. Despite the consistent evidence of external validation, these women lacked the internal acknowledgement of their accomplishments. The participants explained how their success was a result of luck, and others simply overestimating their intelligence and abilities. Clance and Imes believed that this mental framework for impostor phenomenon developed from factors such as: [[gender stereotypes]], early family dynamics, culture, and [[Attribution (psychology)|attribution]] style. The researchers determined that the women who experienced impostor phenomenon showcased symptoms related to [[Depression (mood)|depression]], generalized [[anxiety]], and low [[self-confidence]].\n\nClance and Imes stated in their 1978 article that, based on their clinical experience, impostor phenomenon was less prevalent in men. They noted that further research was necessary to determine the effects impostor phenomenon has on men.<ref name=Clance1978/> Following the publication in 1978, more research has determined that this experience occurs in demographics outside of just high-achieving, successful women.<ref name=\"Langford19932\"/>\n\n== Prevalence ==\nIn more current research, impostor phenomenon is studied as a reaction to particular [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] and events. It is a phenomenon (an experience) that occurs in an individual, not a [[mental disorder]]. \n\nImpostor phenomenon is not recognized in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] or [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems|ICD]], although both of these classification systems recognize low self-esteem and sense of failure as associated symptoms of depression.<ref>American Psychiatric Association (2000a). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (Fourth Edition, Text Revision: DSM-IV-TR ed.).

The scale can be utilized to determine if characteristics of fear are present, and to what extent. The aspects of fear include: fear of evaluation, fear of not continuing success and fear of not being as capable as others.<ref name=Hoang2013>{{Cite journal|last=Hoang|first=Queena|date=January 2013|title=The Impostor Phenomenon: Overcoming Internalized Barriers and Recognizing Achievements|url=|journal=The Vermont Connection|volume= 34, Article 6.|pages=|via=http://scholarworks.uvm.edu/tvc/vol34/iss1/6}}</ref>\n\nIn her 1985 paper, Clance explained that impostor phenomenon can be distinguished by the following six dimensions:<ref name=Sakulku2011>{{Cite journal|last1=Sakulku|first1=J.|last2=Alexander|first2=J.|date=2011|title=The Impostor Phenomenon|url=https://www.tci-thaijo.org/index.php/IJBS/article/view/521|journal=International Journal of Behavioral Science|volume= 6|pages=73\u201392|doi=10.14456/ijbs.2011.6}}</ref>\n\n* The impostor cycle\n* The need to be special or the best\n* Characteristics of superman/superwoman\n* Fear of failure\n* Denial of ability and discounting praise\n* Feeling fear and guilt about success\n\nClance noted that the characteristics of these six dimensions may vary. By this model, for an individual to be considered to experience impostorism, at least two of these aspects have to be present. Clance theorised that the most important aspect to understand the manifestation of this experience can be seen through the ''impostor cycle'' she created.<ref name=Clance1978/>\n\n===Five types===\nBuilding upon decades of research, Valerie Young further looked into fraudulent feelings among high achievers. From her book ''The Secret Thoughts of Successful Women: Why Capable People Suffer From the Imposter Syndrome and How to Thrive in Spite of It'', she was able to identify five subgroups this syndrome often falls into.\n\n* The perfectionist\n\n* The superwoman/man\n\n* The natural genius\n\n* The soloist\n\n* The expert\n\nStudies suggest that more than 70% of people experience the impostor syndrome at some point in their career. By identifying the above competency point,  steps can be taken towards addressing it.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.themuse.com/advice/5-different-types-of-imposter-syndrome-and-5-ways-to-battle-each-one|title=5 Types of Imposter Syndrome and How to Stop Them|website=The Muse}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://impostorsyndrome.com/5-types-of-impostors/|title=The 5 Types of Impostors:|date=December 6, 2011|website=Impostor Syndrome}}</ref>\n\n=== The impostor cycle ===\n\nThe impostor cycle, as defined by Clance, begins with an achievement-related task. An example of an achievement-related task could be an exercise that was assigned through work or school. Once one has received an assignment, feelings of anxiety, [[self-doubt]], and worry immediately follow. The cycle accounts for two possible reactions that stem from these feelings. One will respond either by over-preparation or by [[procrastination]].\n\nIf one responds with procrastination, this initial response will turn into a frantic effort to complete the job. Once the task has been completed, there will be a brief period of accomplishment and feeling of relief. If positive feedback is given once the work has been completed and turned in, one will discount the positive feedback.\n\nIf one responded to the task with over-preparation, the successful outcome will be seen as a result of hard work. If one responds by procrastination, one will view the outcome as a matter of luck. In the impostor cycle, gaining success through hard work or luck is not interpreted as a matter of true, personal ability. This means that it does not matter which mechanism one used to complete the task. Even if the outcome results in a positive response, the feedback given has no effect on one's perception of personal success. This leads one to discount positive feedback.\n\nThis sequence of events serves as a [[Reinforcement (psychology)|reinforcement]], causing the cycle to remain in motion. With every cycle, feelings of perceived fraudulence, increased self-doubt, depression, and anxiety accumulate. As the cycle continues, increased success leads to the intensification of feeling like a fraud. This experience causes one to remain haunted by one's lack of perceived personal ability. Believing that at any point one can be 'exposed' for who one thinks one really is keeps the cycle in motion.<ref name=Clance1978/>\n\n=== Gender studies ===\n\nStudies on impostor phenomenon have received mixed reviews regarding the presence of impostor phenomenon in men and women.<ref name=Sakulku2011/> Clance and Imes investigated this experience in high achieving women in their 1978 study.<ref name=Clance1978/> Following the publication of this study, researchers have investigated impostor phenomenon in both men and women. Clance and Imes suggested that this experience manifests in women more than in men.<ref name=Clance1978/> \n\nA study in 2006 looked at gender differences when exploring a possible relationship between the feeling of being an impostor and the achievement of goals. The researchers concluded that the women who participated in this study experienced impostor phenomenon more so than the men who participated.<ref name=Kumar2006/> Other research has shown that women commonly face impostor phenomenon in regard to performance. The perception of ability and power is evidenced in out-performing others. For men, impostor phenomenon is often driven by the fear of being unsuccessful, or not good enough.<ref name=Royse2010>{{Cite journal|last=Royse Roskowki|first=Jane C.|date=2010|title=Impostor Phenomenon and Counselling Self-Efficacy: The Impact of Impostor Feelings|url=|journal=Ball State University|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Despite these differences, there is a significant amount of literature on impostor phenomenon and gender differences stating that it is spread equally among men and women.<ref name=Royse2010/>\n\n=== Among women of color in academia ===\nResearch findings suggest that impostor syndrome/phenomenon affects women of color mentally and academically. A pattern in the research literature shows that women report experiencing impostor phenomenon more frequently than men. Women of color also often are afflicted with impostor syndrome in elite universities.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Darlene G.|last2=Kastberg|first2=Signe M.|date=September 1995|title=Of blue collars and ivory towers: Women from blue\u2010collar backgrounds in higher education|journal=Roeper Review|volume=18|issue=1|pages=27\u201333|doi=10.1080/02783199509553693|issn=0278-3193}}</ref> Research stated that though men do experience doubt and lack of belonging in [[academia]], being a woman and a person of color in the United States means being susceptible to encountering \"hideous forms of racism and sexism\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Walton|first=Gregory M.|last2=Cohen|first2=Geoffrey L.|date=2007|title=A question of belonging: Race, social fit, and achievement|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=92|issue=1|pages=82\u201396|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.92.1.82|issn=1939-1315|citeseerx=10.1.1.320.7960|pmid=17201544}}</ref> Therefore, these experiences of racism and sexism amplify the likelihood that women of color might experience impostor phenomenon.\n\nThe intersection of race and gender for women of color in academia is important because both identities can heavily impact women of color and their academic experience, especially if their identities are visible. For example, a black woman in higher education might fear she will be stereotyped as aggressive or angry if she expresses a controversial opinion in class. According to Miller and Kastberg, both explicit and subtle forms of racism and sexism make it much more difficult for women of color to break through the barriers of higher education.<ref name=\":0\" /> Another example: explicit racist policies{{Which|date=September 2019}} that exclude Asian American women{{Dubious|Explicit Racist policies (in the USA)?|date=September 2019}} suggest that they do not experience academic barriers. Therefore, these women may not feel as though they are allowed to ask for help.{{Citation needed|reason=This statement is made in a generic way, and could be made for anyone. A link to a study is needed.|date=September 2019}} \n\nStudies on impostor phenomenon have shown that the [[Intersectionality|intersecting]] identities of women of color in academia affect identity development and goal achievement.  For example, Ostrove (2003) found that women of color from lower- and middle-class backgrounds reported feeling more alienated from their peers during their time spent at an elite college.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ostrove|first=Joan M.|date=December 2003|title=Belonging and Wanting: Meanings of Social Class Background for Women's Constructions of their College Experiences|journal=Journal of Social Issues|volume=59|issue=4|pages=771\u2013784|doi=10.1046/j.0022-4537.2003.00089.x|issn=0022-4537}}</ref> Similarly, Walton and Cohen's (2007) work on the effects of racial underrepresentation at elite private universities shows that women of color who experience [[social alienation]] in academia could easily experience impostor syndrome.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nCommon causes of impostor phenomenon include feelings such as [[social stigma|stigma]], [[stereotype threat]], or an overall sense of \"intellectual phoniness\". For example, a woman attending a predominately white institution is likely to worry that her accomplishments are not good enough relative to her peers\u2019 accomplishments. These thoughts could derive from feeling that she was accepted into a university because of affirmative action or by \"accident\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Attewell|first=Paul|last2=Domina|first2=Thurston|date=January 2011|title=Educational imposters and fake degrees|journal=Research in Social Stratification and Mobility|volume=29|issue=1|pages=57\u201369|doi=10.1016/j.rssm.2010.12.004|issn=0276-5624}}</ref>\n\n== Occurrence ==\nThe feeling of being a fraud that surfaces in impostor phenomenon is not uncommon. It has been estimated that nearly 70% of individuals will experience signs and symptoms of impostor phenomenon at least once in their life.<ref name=Ravindran>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theopennotebook.com/2016/11/15/feeling-like-a-fraud-the-impostor-phenomenon-in-science-writing/|title=Feeling Like A Fraud: The Impostor Phenomenon in Science Writing|last=Ravindran|first=Sandeep|date=November 15, 2016|website=The Open Notebook|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}</ref> This can be a result of a new academic or professional setting. Research shows that impostor phenomenon is not uncommon for students who enter a new academic environment. Feelings of insecurity can come as a result of an unknown, new environment. This can lead to lower self-confidence and belief in their own abilities.<ref name=Hoang2013/>\n\n=== Settings ===\nImpostor phenomenon can occur in other various settings. Some examples include:\n* A new environment<ref name=Sakulku2011/>\n* Academic settings<ref name=Clance1978/>\n* In the workplace<ref name=Clance1978/>\n* Social interactions<ref name=Hoang2013/>\n* Relationships (platonic or romantic)<ref name=Hoang2013/>\n\nIn relationships, people with impostorism often feel they do not live up to the expectations of their friends or loved ones. It is common for the individual with impostorism to think that they must have somehow tricked others into liking them and wanting to spend time with them. They experience feelings of being unworthy, or of not deserving the beneficial relationships they possess.<ref name=Hoang2013/>\n\nThere is empirical evidence that demonstrates the harmful effects of impostor phenomenon in students. Studies have shown that when a student's academic self-concept increases, the symptoms of impostor phenomenon decrease, and vice versa.<ref name=Royse2010/> The worry and emotions the students held, had a direct impact of their performance in the program.\n\nCommon facets of impostor phenomenon in the class-room include:<ref name=Hoang2013/>\n\n* Students compared themselves to their class-mates<ref name=Sakulku2011/>\n* Students did not feel prepared academically when they compared themselves to their class-mates<ref name=Sakulku2011/>\n* Students often questioned the grounds on which they were accepted into the program<ref name=Hoang2013/>\n* Students perceived that positive recognition, awards, and good grades stemmed from external factors, not from personal ability or intelligence.<ref name=Hoang2013/>\n\nCokley et al. investigated the impact impostor phenomenon has on students, specifically ethnic minority students. They found that the feelings the students had of being fraudulent resulted in psychological distress. Ethnic minority students often questioned the grounds on which they were accepted into the program. They held the false assumption that they only received their acceptance due to affirmative action\u2014rather than an extraordinary application and qualities they had to offer.<ref name=Cokley>{{Cite journal |last=Cokley |first=Kevin |first2=Shannon |last2=McClain |first3=Alicia |last3=Enciso |first4=Mercedes |last4=Martinez |display-authors=1 |date=2013 |title=An Examination of the Impact of Minority Status Stress and Impostor Feelings on the Mental Health of Diverse Ethnic Minority College Students|doi=10.1002/j.2161-1912.2013.00029.x |journal=Journal of Multicultural Counseling and Development|volume= 41 |issue=2 |pages=82\u201395 }}</ref>\n\n=== Connections ===\nResearch has shown that there is a relationship between impostor phenomenon and the following factors:\n\n* Family expectations<ref name=Hoang2013/>\n* Overprotective parent(s) or legal guardian(s)<ref name=Ravindran/>\n* Graduate-level coursework<ref name=Hoang2013/>\n* Racial identities<ref name=Hoang2013/>\n* Attribution style<ref name=Royse2010/>\n* Anxiety<ref name=Royse2010/>\n* Depression<ref name=Royse2010/>\n* Low trait self-esteem<ref name=Royse2010/>\n* Perfectionism<ref name=Clance1978/>\n* Excessive self-monitoring, with an emphasis on self-worth<ref name=Sakulku2011/>\n\nThe aspects listed are not mutually exclusive. These components are often found to correlate among individuals with impostor phenomenon. It is incorrect to infer that the correlational relationship between these aspects cause the impostor experience.<ref name=Hoang2013/>\n\nIn individuals with impostor phenomenon, feelings of guilt often result in a fear of success. The following are examples of common notions that lead to feelings of guilt and reinforce the phenomenon.<ref name=Kumar2006>{{Cite journal|last1=Kumar|first1=S.|last2=Jagacinski|first2=C.M.|year=2006|title=Impostors have goals too: The impostor phenomenon and its relationship to achievement goal theory.|url=|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=40|number=1|pages=147\u2013157|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2005.05.014}}</ref>\n\n* The good education they were able to receive\n* Being acknowledged by others for success\n* Belief that it is not right or fair to be in a better situation than a friend or loved one\n* Being referred to as:<ref name=Hoang2013/>\n** \"The smart one\"\n** \"The talented one\"\n** \"The responsible one\"\n** \"The sensitive one\"\n** \"The good one\"\n** \"Our favorite\"\n\n==Management==\nIn their 1978 paper, Clance and Imes proposed a therapeutic approach they used for their participants or clients with impostor phenomenon. This technique includes a group setting where various individuals meet others who are also living with this experience. The researchers explained that group meetings made a significant impact on their participants. They proposed that it was the realization that they were not the only ones who experienced these feelings. The participants were required to complete various homework assignments as well. In one assignment, participants recalled all of the people they believed they had fooled or tricked in the past. In another take-home task, individuals wrote down the positive feedback they had received. Later, they would have to recall why they received this feedback and what about it made them perceive it in a negative light. In the group sessions, the researchers also had the participants re-frame common thoughts and ideas about performance. An example would be to change: \"I might fail this exam\" to \"I will do well on this exam\".<ref name=Clance1978/>\n\nThe researchers concluded that simply extracting the self-doubt before an event occurs helps eliminate feelings of impostorism.<ref name=Clance1978/> It was recommended that the individuals struggling with this experience seek support from friends and family. Although impostor phenomenon is not a mental condition, it can still affect an individual strongly.<ref name=Ravindran/>\n\nOther research on therapeutic approaches for impostorism emphasizes the importance of self-worth. Individuals who live with impostor phenomenon commonly relate self-esteem and self-worth to others. A major aspect of other therapeutic approaches for impostor phenomenon focus on separating the two into completely separate entities.<ref name=Royse2010/>\n\nIn a study in 2013, researcher Queena Hoang proposed that intrinsic motivation can decrease the feelings of being a fraud that are common in impostor phenomenon.<ref name=Hoang2013/> This includes a series of re-framing current ideas. The following are examples listed in Hoang's 2013 paper:\n\n* \"I want to receive that degree. I won't give up and have too much pride to walk away.\"\n* \"If I can do this, I will be able to help others in the future and work with people as motivated as I am.\"\n* \"I can be the voice of other People of Color who do not have the opportunities like I do.\"\n* \"I know I can do this.\"\n* Learning how to \"be your own person.\"\n* Learning how to accept and believe compliments.\n\nHoang also suggested that implementing a mentor program for new or entering students will minimize students' feelings of self-doubt. Having a mentor who has been in the program will help the new students feel supported. This allows for a much smoother and less overwhelming transition.\n\nImpostor experience can be addressed with many kinds of [[psychotherapy]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Matthews |first1=Gail |last2=Clance |first2=Pauline Rose |date=February 1985 |title=Treatment of the impostor phenomenon in psychotherapy clients |journal=Psychotherapy in Private Practice |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=71\u201381 |doi=10.1300/J294v03n01_09}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Leahy |first=Robert L. |date=2005 |chapter=Work worries: What if I really mess up? |title=The worry cure: seven steps to stop worry from stopping you |location=New York |publisher=[[Harmony Books]] |pages=273\u2013290 (274) |isbn=978-1400097654 |oclc=57531355}} Discusses treatment of impostor syndrome with [[cognitive therapy]].</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Harris |first=Russ |date=2011 |title=The confidence gap: a guide to overcoming fear and self-doubt |location=Boston |publisher=Trumpeter |isbn=9781590309230 |oclc=694394371}} Discusses treatment of impostor syndrome with [[acceptance and commitment therapy]].</ref> [[Group psychotherapy]] is an especially common and effective way of alleviating the impostor experience.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Clance |first1=Pauline Rose |last2=Dingman |first2=Debbara |last3=Reviere |first3=Susan L. |last4=Stober |first4=Dianne R. |date=June 1995 |title=Impostor phenomenon in an interpersonal/social context |journal=[[Women & Therapy]] |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=79\u201396 (87) |doi=10.1300/J015v16n04_07 |quote=One of the most exciting and effective treatment modalities for women struggling with the impostor phenomenon is group psychotherapy.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Lowman |first=Rodney L. |date=1993 |chapter=Fear of success and fear of failure |title=Counseling and psychotherapy of work dysfunctions |location=Washington, DC |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |pages=[https://archive.org/details/counselingpsycho00lowmrich/page/74 74\u201382 (81)] |isbn=978-1557982049 |oclc=27812757 |doi=10.1037/10133-004 |quote=Group treatment programs have reported positive results in lowering FOF [fear of failure] (Rajendran & Kaliappan, 1990). The value of groups in countering the so-called impostor phenomenon, in which an individual feels that he or she has succeeded inappropriately and will soon be \"found out\" to be a fraud, has also been reported (Clance & O'Toole, 1987; J.
