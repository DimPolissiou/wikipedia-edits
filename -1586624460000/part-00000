The 63rd edition of the [[NBA Finals|championship series]] was played between June 4 and June 14 and was broadcast on U.S. television on [[NBA on ABC|ABC]].\n\nThe Lakers earned their berth into the [[2009 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] by winning the [[Pacific Division (NBA)|Pacific Division]].

The NBA Finals were staged under a 2\u20133\u20132 rotation, with the Lakers holding [[home advantage|home-court advantage]] as they had a better regular season record than the Magic.\n\n[[Kobe Bryant]] led the team to a Game 1 win with 40 points, eight rebounds, and eight assists. Game 2 was a high-scoring affair that the Lakers ultimately won on both strong defensive play and last minute heroics by Bryant, [[Derek Fisher]], and [[Pau Gasol]] during the overtime. A record-breaking performance from the Magic's 65% team shooting ensured the team a Game 3 win and the first Finals victory in franchise history. Although they trailed the Magic as much as 12 at halftime, the Lakers won Game 4 in overtime on the back of [[Trevor Ariza]]'s 13 points in the second half and Fisher's pair of three-point clutch shots. Dominant offensive play coupled with a spectacular defense by both starters and reserves from the second quarter until the buzzer helped the Lakers to win Game 5 and secure the series. Bryant was named [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] of the Finals.\n\nRodd Houston narrated the Lakers' 2009 season through the Lakers 2009 championship home video on [[NBA Entertainment]].

They played three physical series against the [[Utah Jazz]], [[Houston Rockets]], and [[Denver Nuggets]], winning in 5, 7, and 6 games, respectively. Going into the Finals, the Lakers finished off the Nuggets in the Western Conference Finals with two good performances in games 5 and 6, making analysts pick them as the favorites in the Finals. It marked a record-extending sixth Finals appearance of the decade and a record-extending 30th Finals appearance overall, the most for any NBA team.\n\n===Orlando Magic===\n{{Main|2008\u201309 Orlando Magic season}}\nThe [[Orlando Magic|Magic]] were overlooked by many to even reach the Eastern Conference Finals, as they played in the shadows of the #1-seeded [[Cleveland Cavaliers]], led by regular-season [[NBA MVP|MVP]] [[LeBron James]], and defending champion #2-seed [[Boston Celtics]]. However, after dispatching the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in six games, the Magic stunned the Celtics by winning [[List of NBA game sevens|Game 7]] in [[Boston]]. The Celtics were previously 32\u20130 when leading a series 3\u20132, and 17\u20133 previously in Game 7s at home. Orlando assistant coach [[Patrick Ewing]] had publicly \"guaranteed\" that Orlando would win game 7.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/recap;_ylt=AlT7qdkLBThF5x98WEzpSs.8vLYF?gid=2009051702&prov=ap|title=Magic Moment: Orlando beats Boston to advance|first=Jimmy|last=Golen|date=May 18, 2009|agency=Associated Press|work=Yahoo.com|quote=Magic assistant coach Patrick Ewing had guaranteed a victory. But Celtics coach [[Doc Rivers]], who had been Ewing\u2019s teammate with the New York Knicks, laughed it off.| accessdate= 29 July 2009 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref>\n\nIn the next round, Orlando was given little chance by many to defeat the top-seeded Cleveland Cavaliers, but a combination of three-point shooting and the inside presence of [[Dwight Howard]] created a matchup nightmare for Cleveland on defense, and Orlando ultimately won in six games. In Game 6, Howard's stellar performance with 40 points and 14 rebounds helped the franchise earn its second Finals appearance (they were swept by the [[Houston Rockets]] in the {{nbafy|1995}} Finals during [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and [[Penny Hardaway]] era).\n\n===Series preview===\nAlthough the Magic won both regular-season matchups with the Lakers, Los Angeles was able to take 4 out of 5 games in this series. Both regular-season games and three of the NBA Finals games were close contests, decided by six points or fewer or in overtime. The Lakers won Game 2 on June 7 101\u201396 in overtime. Then they won Game 4 on June 11 in overtime as well.\n\n[[Tyronn Lue]], a backup point guard with Orlando, appeared with the Lakers during their initial championship run in the early 2000s and faced his former team in the finals. Lue and another backup point guard, [[Anthony Johnson (basketball)|Anthony Johnson]] were the only players on Orlando's roster with NBA finals experience. However, neither saw playing time during the series, as Lue was inactive with an injury and Johnson lost his minutes to teammate [[Jameer Nelson]], who returned from a shoulder injury in time for the Finals, where he led the Magic to sweep the Lakers in regular season. [[Trevor Ariza]], the Lakers starting small forward, faced the team who traded him to the Lakers in 2007.\n\n====Regular-season series====\nThe [[Orlando Magic]] won both games in the regular-season series:\n{{basketballbox\n| bg=#fff\n| date = December 20, 2008\n| report = {{NBA Recap|2008|1220|id=LALORL}}\n| team1 = [[Los Angeles Lakers]] |score1=103 \n| team2 = '''[[Orlando Magic]] |score2=106'''\n| place = [[Amway Arena]], [[Orlando, Florida]]\n}}\n{{basketballbox\n| date = January 16, 2009\n| report = {{NBA Recap|2009|0116|id=ORLLAL}}\n| team1 = '''[[Orlando Magic]] |score1=109'''\n| team2 = [[Los Angeles Lakers]] |score2=103\n| place = [[Staples Center]], [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]]\n}}\n\n==Game summaries==\n:''All times are in [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Daylight Time]] ([[UTC\u22124]]).''\n\n===Game 1===\n{{basketballbox|bg=#eee |date=June 4 |time=9:00 p.m. |place=[[Staples Center]], [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]] |TV=[[NBA on ABC|ABC]]\n|team1=[[Orlando Magic]] |score1=75\n|team2='''[[Los Angeles Lakers]]''' |score2='''100'''\n|Q1='''24'''\u201322 |Q2=19\u2013'''31''' |Q3=15\u2013'''29''' |Q4=17\u2013'''18'''\n|points1=[[Micka\u00ebl Pi\u00e9trus]] 14 |points2=[[Kobe Bryant]] 40\n|rebounds1=[[Dwight Howard]] 15 |rebounds2=[[Lamar Odom]] 14\n|assist1=[[Jameer Nelson]] 4 |assist2=[[Kobe Bryant]] 8\n|report={{NBA Recap|2009|0604|id=ORLLAL}}<br />{{YouTube|ImYGQWmK9ho|Video highlights}}\n|attendance=18,997\n|referee = \n* No. 43 [[Dan Crawford (basketball referee)|Dan Crawford]]\n* No. 14 [[Joe DeRosa (referee)|Joe DeRosa]]\n* No. 41 [[Ken Mauer]]\n|series=L.A.

Down 33\u201328 with 8:38 left in the 2nd quarter, the Lakers went on a 10\u20130 run and never looked back. The Lakers ended the 3rd quarter on a 25\u201310 run, led by the fierce play from [[Kobe Bryant]], who finished with 40 points, 8 rebounds, and 8 assists, joining the likes of [[Shaquille O'Neal]], [[Michael Jordan]], and [[Jerry West]] to put up those numbers in a single NBA Finals game. The 25-point margin of victory was the 6th-largest in NBA Finals Game 1 history.\n\nDue to stellar defense by the Lakers, Dwight Howard was a dismal 1\u20136 from the field, his fewest made field goals in his playoff career, and finished with 12 points, 10 of which came from free throws. The Magic shot only 29.9% (23\u201377) from the field, the second lowest percentage in the NBA Finals.\n\n===Game 2===\n{{basketballbox|bg=#eee |date=June 7 |time=8:00 p.m. |place=[[Staples Center]], [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]] |TV=[[NBA on ABC|ABC]]\n|team1=[[Orlando Magic]] |score1=96\n|team2='''[[Los Angeles Lakers]]''' |score2='''101'''\n|Q1=15\u201315 |Q2=20\u2013'''25''' |Q3='''30'''\u201323 |Q4=23\u2013'''25''' |OT=8\u2013'''13'''\n|points1=[[Rashard Lewis]] 34 |points2=[[Kobe Bryant]] 29\n|rebounds1=[[Dwight Howard]] 16 |rebounds2=[[Pau Gasol]] 10\n|assist1=[[Rashard Lewis]] 7 |assist2=[[Kobe Bryant]] 8\n|report={{NBA Recap|2009|0607|id=ORLLAL}}<br />{{YouTube|saSgjfA5x9Q|Video highlights}}\n|attendance=18,997\n|referee = \n* No. 29 [[Steve Javie]]\n* No. 13 [[Monty McCutchen]]\n* No. 49 Tom Washington\n|series=L.A.

The Lakers picked up the pace in the 2nd quarter, but [[Rashard Lewis]] kept the Magic in the game, scoring 18 of the team's 20 points in the quarter, including the final 16, on his way to a playoff career-high and Finals franchise-high 34 points for the game. The Magic outscored the Lakers in the 3rd quarter to take a 2-point lead in the 4th.\n\nWith the game tied at 84, Rashard Lewis hit a jumper with 1:32 remaining to give the Magic a 2-point lead. Kobe Bryant responded with a jumper of his own to tie the game. With 47 seconds left, [[Hedo T\u00fcrko\u011flu]] hit a jumper that was originally called a 3-pointer. However, replay showed that his foot was on the line, giving the Magic a 2-point lead. With 33 seconds remaining, [[Dwight Howard]] was able to deflect, but not steal, a [[Derek Fisher]] pass, and [[Pau Gasol]] was able to again tie the game at 88 with a layup.\n\nOn the ensuing Magic possession, the Lakers played great defense and forced [[Courtney Lee]] to miss an awkward layup shot with 10.5 seconds left. With a chance to take a 2\u20130 series lead, Kobe Bryant was blocked on a jumper by T\u00fcrko\u011flu, who gained control of the ball and called time-out with 0.6 seconds left. After another timeout, T\u00fcrko\u011flu threw a half-court lob to Courtney Lee, who had come free after a screen on his defender. However, Lee was traveling too fast and launched his layup from almost behind the backboard, causing it to miss.\n\nWith the Lakers up 1 in overtime with 1:55 left, Derek Fisher stole a [[J. J. Redick]] pass and was fouled on the ensuing fastbreak, making both free throws. After the Magic were unable to convert, Kobe Bryant made a pivotal assist to Pau Gasol for a layup-and-one, giving the Lakers a 6-point lead and the eventual victory.\n\n===Game 3===\n{{basketballbox|bg=#eee |date=June 9 |time=9:00 p.m. |place=[[Amway Arena]], [[Orlando, Florida]] |TV=[[NBA on ABC|ABC]]\n|team1=[[Los Angeles Lakers]] |score1=104\n|team2='''[[Orlando Magic]]''' |score2='''108'''\n|Q1='''31'''\u201327|Q2=23\u2013'''32''' |Q3=21\u2013'''22''' |Q4='''29'''\u201327\n|points1=[[Kobe Bryant]] 31 |points2=[[Dwight Howard|Howard]], [[Rashard Lewis|Lewis]] 21 each\n|rebounds1=[[Trevor Ariza]] 7 |rebounds2=[[Dwight Howard]] 14\n|assist1=[[Kobe Bryant]] 8 |assist2=[[Hedo T\u00fcrko\u011flu]] 7\n|report={{NBA Recap|2009|0609|id=LALORL}}<br />{{YouTube|L9TS1M7LL6k|Video highlights}}\n|attendance=17,461\n|referee = \n* No. 17 [[Joe Crawford (basketball, born 1951)|Joe Crawford]]\n* No. 9 Derrick Stafford\n* No. 18 [[Mark Wunderlich]]\n|series=L.A.

This also included a 75% first quarter, also a Finals record. However, despite the incredible shooting percentage, the Lakers managed to stay close for much of the game. The game was only sealed for the Magic on a Mikael Pietrus steal from Kobe Bryant in the waning minute of the 4th quarter.\n\nThis win marked the first Finals win in Magic franchise history, losing their first 6 Finals games (being swept in their first appearance and losing Games 1 and 2)\n\n===Game 4===\n{{basketballbox|bg=#eee |date=June 11 |time=9:00 p.m. |place=[[Amway Arena]], [[Orlando, Florida]] |TV=[[NBA on ABC|ABC]]\n|team1='''[[Los Angeles Lakers]]''' |score1='''99''' \n|team2=[[Orlando Magic]] |score2=91\n|Q1=20\u2013'''24''' |Q2=17\u2013'''25''' |Q3='''30'''\u201314 |Q4=20\u2013'''24''' |OT='''12'''\u20134\n|points1=[[Kobe Bryant]] 32 |points2=[[Hedo T\u00fcrko\u011flu]] 25\n|rebounds1=[[Pau Gasol]] 10 |rebounds2=[[Dwight Howard]] 21\n|assist1=[[Kobe Bryant]] 8 |assist2=[[Rashard Lewis]] 4\n|report={{NBA Recap|2009|0611|id=LALORL}}<br />{{YouTube|o4xg3TyVV_Y|Video highlights}}\n|attendance=17,461\n|referee = \n* No. 24 Mike Callahan\n* No. 48 [[Scott Foster (referee)|Scott Foster]]\n* No. 15 [[Bennett Salvatore]]\n|series=L.A. Lakers leads series, 3\u20131\n}}\n\nComing off their franchise's first NBA Finals game victory, the Magic quickly took the lead in the first quarter. However, [[Kobe Bryant]] kept the Lakers in the game, scoring 13 of the team's 20 first-quarter points. [[Dwight Howard]] played a great first quarter, with 11 rebounds and 4 blocks in the opening frame. In addition, he drew many fouls, putting [[Andrew Bynum]], [[Pau Gasol]], and [[Lamar Odom]] in foul trouble and forcing Lakers coach [[Phil Jackson]] to use [[Josh Powell]] and [[D. J. Mbenga]] early in the game. The Magic were able to increase the lead to 12 at halftime.\n\nThe Lakers came out of the locker room aggressive and outscored the Magic 30\u201314 in the 3rd quarter, led by [[Trevor Ariza]], who scored 13 points in the quarter, including two 3-pointers. Down by 6 in the opening minutes of the 4th quarter, the Magic were able to come back to take a 76\u201375 lead halfway through the quarter, but unable to increase the lead due to poor free-throw shooting, specifically from [[Hedo T\u00fcrko\u011flu]] and [[Dwight Howard]].\n\nWith 3 minutes left in the 4th quarter and the game tied at 79, Howard converted a 3-point play to give the Magic an 82\u201379 lead. On the next Laker possession, the Magic played good defense, but Trevor Ariza was able to hit a 3-pointer as the shot clock expired to tie the game at 82. After Hedo T\u00fcrko\u011flu hit a stepback 3-point shot, Howard blocked Gasol's jumper, giving him a single-game NBA Finals record with 9 blocked shots. On the bench to witness it was a previous record holder, his assistant coach [[Patrick Ewing]], who had 8 in Game 5 of the [[1994 NBA Finals]] while with the [[New York Knicks]]. T\u00fcrko\u011flu made another jumper with 1:34 remaining to give the Magic a 5-point lead.\n\nDown 87\u201382 with 31 seconds left, [[Kobe Bryant]] spun through the lane and passed to Gasol for a dunk to cut the lead to 3. On the next Magic possession, Howard was fouled by Bryant with 11 seconds remaining. Needing just one free-throw to make the game a 2-possession affair, Howard missed both shots.\n\nOut of the timeout, the Lakers elected to take the ball out at three-quarters court instead of half-court in order to space out the floor. The Magic double-teamed Bryant in the backcourt, allowing him to pass the ball up to Ariza, who in turned passed it to [[Derek Fisher]] on the right wing. Having missed his first five 3-point shots of the game, Fisher spotted up and hit a pivotal three-pointer over Jameer Nelson to tie the game at 87 with 4.6 seconds left. On the final possession of regulation, [[Micka\u00ebl Pi\u00e9trus]] missed a 20-footer.\n\nThe overtime session began with a 3-pointer by [[Rashard Lewis]] and two contested jumpers by [[Kobe Bryant]] to give the Lakers a 91\u201390 lead. With 1:27 left in OT, Howard split a pair of free throws to tie the game at 91. On the next possession, the Lakers would miss a layup and a jumper, but regained possession on an offensive rebound by Ariza and a loose-ball foul on [[Jameer Nelson]]. With 31 seconds left, Kobe Bryant passed out of a double-team with the controversy of no called on Jameer Nelson after being knocked out by Kobe Bryant. Before, Fisher then hit a 3-pointer to give the Lakers a 94\u201391 lead.\n\nOut of a timeout, T\u00fcrko\u011flu rushed a 3-point shot and missed. Rashard Lewis backtapped the rebound to center-court, but the ball went to Pau Gasol, who ran in unimpeded for a dunk, giving the Lakers the lead for good. In the next possession, the Magic missed another shot, bouncing the ball to Fisher, who passed it to Ariza, then to Gasol for a dunk, but Pietrus slammed both arms on his back, resulting in Gasol getting a technical foul and Pietrus a flagrant 1 foul.\n\nAfter coming so close, the Magic lost a chance to tie the series, a fact not lost upon the arena staff in Orlando. Upon the game's finish, [[Oasis (band)|Oasis's]] \"[[Don't Look Back in Anger]]\" was played throughout Amway Arena.\n\n===Game 5===\n{{basketballbox|bg=#eee |date=June 14 |time=8:00 p.m. |place=[[Amway Center]], [[Orlando, Florida]] |TV=[[NBA on ABC|ABC]]\n|team1='''[[Los Angeles Lakers]]''' |score1='''99'''\n|team2=[[Orlando Magic]] |score2= 86\n|report={{NBA Recap|2009|0614|id=LALORL}}<br />{{YouTube|u_qNvMeVsZc|Video highlights}}\n|Q1=26\u2013'''28''' |Q2='''30'''\u201318 |Q3='''20'''\u201315 |Q4=23\u2013'''25'''\n|points1=[[Kobe Bryant]] 30 |points2=[[Rashard Lewis]] 18\n|rebounds1=[[Pau Gasol]] 15 |rebounds2=[[Dwight Howard|Howard]], [[Rashard Lewis|Lewis]] 10 each\n|assist1=[[Kobe Bryant]] 5 |assist2=[[Rashard Lewis|Lewis]], [[Jameer Nelson|Nelson]] 4 each\n|attendance=17,461\n|referee= \n* No. 43 [[Dan Crawford (basketball referee)|Dan Crawford]]\n* No. 14 [[Joe DeRosa (referee)|Joe DeRosa]]\n* No. 41 [[Ken Mauer]]\n|series=L.A.

In the opening frame, all 5 starters scored and assisted on at least one field goal, but the Lakers pulled to within 2 at the quarter break. Down 40\u201336 with 7:11 in the 2nd quarter, the Lakers went on a 16\u20130 run, fueled by two 3-pointers and solid defensive play from [[Trevor Ariza]]. The Lakers led by as much as 12 in the 2nd quarter and the score was 56\u201346 at halftime.\n\nComing out of the half, Orlando cut the lead to 5 with 7:45 remaining in the 3rd on a 3-pointer by [[Rafer Alston]]. [[Lamar Odom]] answered with back-to-back 3-pointers to restore the Laker lead to double digits. Leading by as much as 18 in the half, Los Angeles led by 15 going into the 4th quarter. In the final quarter, Orlando attempted a run but managed to cut the lead down to only 12; at the buzzer, the Lakers celebrated their 15th title.<ref>{{cite web|first=Tom|last=Withers|title=Bryant, Lakers reign once more|url=http://www.nba.com/games/20090614/LALORL/recap.html|publisher=[[National Basketball Association]]|date=2009-06-14|accessdate=2009-06-15|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618135606/http://www.nba.com/games/20090614/LALORL/recap.html|archivedate=18 June 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the game, NBA Commissioner [[David Stern]] presented the Lakers with the [[Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy]] and presented [[Kobe Bryant]] with the [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|Bill Russell NBA Finals MVP Trophy]] during a presentation on center-court at [[Amway Arena]]. Bryant averaged 32.4 points, 5.6 rebounds and 7.4 assists per game during the series.\n\n==Statistics==\n{{listen\n|filename=Welcoming The Lakers To The White House (1-25-10) Barack Obama.ogv\n|title=January 25, 2010 White House Visit\n|description=On January 25, 2010, [[Barack Obama]] hosted the [[2008\u201309 Los Angeles Lakers season|2008\u201309 Los Angeles Lakers]] at the [[White House]] following their victory in the 2009 NBA Finals to end the [[2008\u201309 NBA season]].\n|filetype=[[Ogv]]}}\nThe series was the third straight championship that the Lakers clinched on the road (after [[2001 NBA Finals|2001]] and [[2002 NBA Finals|2002]]); the last time the Lakers clinched the championship at home was in [[2000 NBA Finals|2000]]. With their team's win, [[Pau Gasol]] became the first [[Spain|Spaniard]], and [[D. J. Mbenga]] the first [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] player, to win an NBA championship. [[Bill Walton|Bill]] and [[Luke Walton]] became the third father and son pair to each win a championship as a player; the other father\u2013son combinations are [[Matt Guokas, Sr.]] ([[1947 NBA Finals|1947]]) with [[Matt Guokas|Matt Jr.]] ([[1967 NBA Finals|1967]]) and [[Rick Barry]] ([[1975 NBA Finals|1975]]) with son [[Brent Barry|Brent]] ([[2005 NBA Finals|2005]] and [[2007 NBA Finals|2007]]). [[Kobe Bryant]] averaged 32.4 points and 7.4 assists in this series, which was the best combination of those categories since [[Jerry West]] averaged 37.9 points and 7.4 assists ([[1969 NBA Finals|1969]]).\n\nFor the Magic, Game 3 marked their first Finals game victory; the franchise lost their first six Finals games after being swept in their first Finals appearance in [[1995 NBA Finals|1995]]. In Game 3, the Magic also set the Finals record for the best [[Field goal (basketball)|field goal]] percentage with 63 percent, and the Finals record for the best field goal percentage in the first half with 75 percent.\n\nThis was the first NBA Finals series since [[1984 NBA Finals|1984]] to have two games go into overtime (Games 2 and 4); both were won by the Lakers. [[Dwight Howard]] set an NBA Finals single-game record with 9 blocked shots in Game 4. The previous record holders, all of whom had blocked eight shots in a Finals game,<ref>http://www.nba.com/history/records/finals_game_blockedshots.html</ref> were: [[Bill Walton]] of the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] in Game 6 of the [[1977 NBA Finals]]; [[Hakeem Olajuwon]] of the [[Houston Rockets]] in Game 5 of the [[1986 NBA Finals]]; Howard's assistant coach [[Patrick Ewing]] of the [[New York Knicks]] in Game 5 of the [[1994 NBA Finals]]; [[Shaquille O'Neal]] of the Los Angeles Lakers in Game 2 of the [[2001 NBA Finals]]; and [[Tim Duncan]] of the [[San Antonio Spurs]] in Game 6 of the [[2003 NBA Finals]].\n\nThis is the seventh time in NBA Finals history that a team that lost the championship the previous season has won the Finals the very next year. It is the second time in Lakers history, after the [[1984 NBA Finals|1984]] and [[1985 NBA Finals|1985]] teams.\n\nThis is also the first odd season since 2001 that the [[San Antonio Spurs]] did not win the NBA Finals; they won in [[2003 NBA Finals|2003]], [[2005 NBA Finals|2005]] and [[2007 NBA Finals|2007]].\n\nThis was the last Finals in which a trophy silhouette was painted in mid-court. The tradition began in [[2005 NBA Finals|2005]] and ended for the [[2010 NBA Finals|2010]] series. This was also the last NBA Finals to be played at [[Amway Arena]]; the Magic moved to the [[Amway Center]] for the [[2010-11 NBA season|2010-11 season]].\n \n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:left;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=3|Category !!rowspan=2 colspan=2|High !!colspan=4|Average\n|-\n! colspan=2|[[Los Angeles Lakers]] !! colspan=2|[[Orlando Magic]]\n|-\n!Player !!

The championship was the fourth of the 2000s decade for the Lakers, most among all teams in the four major professional sports leagues in North America. No other NBA team had won at least four titles during this same time period. Therefore, the Los Angeles Lakers can be referred to as the \"Team of the 2000s\".\n\nBy virtue of their win this year and loss in the previous year, this marked tenth occurrence that the winners of the NBA Finals were losers in the preceding year's Finals, previously the [[Detroit Pistons]] had lost and won the Finals in {{nbafy|1988}} and {{nbafy|1989}} respectively. The victory was noted by many as a personal success for Finals MVP [[Kobe Bryant]], winning his first championship and succeeding in the playoffs without the presence of former Lakers center [[Shaquille O'Neal]] where some people had previously speculated that Bryant could not \"win one without Shaq\". Head coach [[Phil Jackson]] captured his 10th NBA championship as a coach, surpassing [[Red Auerbach]] for most championships all-time by an NBA coach. Jackson also passed Auerbach and [[NHL]] coach [[Scotty Bowman]] for most championships all-time by a head coach in a major American sports league. Having achieved three Game 1 victories throughout the postseason (first round vs. [[Utah Jazz|Utah]], conference finals vs. [[Denver Nuggets|Denver]], and NBA Finals vs. Orlando), Phil Jackson-coached teams were now 44\u20130 in series where they win the first game, later improved to 48-0 by the time Jackson retired after the [[2011 NBA Playoffs]].\n\nThe Lakers' only offseason change was the acquisition of [[Ron Artest]] from the [[Houston Rockets]], in an essential trade where they let [[Trevor Ariza]] sign with the Rockets. Again the Lakers won the top seed in the West, though winning just eight games less than the year before. They eliminated the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]] in six, the [[Utah Jazz]] in four, and the [[Phoenix Suns]] in six to return to the NBA Finals and renew their [[Celtics-Lakers rivalry|heated rivalry with the Celtics]]. In the Finals the Lakers won a hard-fought seven game series against the Celtics to retain the NBA title, becoming the first team to repeat as champions since the [[2001-02 Los Angeles Lakers season|2002 Lakers]].\n\n===Magic===\nThe Magic again won 59 games and the division title in the [[2009-10 NBA season|2009-10 season]], in which they let go of [[Hedo T\u00fcrko\u011flu]] to the [[Toronto Raptors]] and acquired [[Vince Carter]] from the [[New Jersey Nets]]. Dwight Howard won [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award|Defensive Player of the Year]] for the second straight year. In the [[2010 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] the Magic swept the [[Charlotte Bobcats]] and the [[Atlanta Hawks]], becoming the first team in NBA history to win their first eight playoff games by 20 or more points. However, the Magic would lose to the [[Boston Celtics]] in six games of the Eastern Conference Finals, marking the final games held at [[Amway Arena]]. The Magic moved to the [[Amway Center]] the next season, then proceeded to lose in the first round for two straight years to the Hawks and the [[Indiana Pacers]], respectively. After the [[2011\u201312 NBA season|2011\u201312 season]] Stan Van Gundy was fired, and in a blockbuster offseason trade, Howard was traded to the Lakers, which he spent one season with the Lakers and later move to [[Houston Rockets]]. However, the team failed to reach [[NBA Finals]] due to the rise of the [[Golden State Warriors]]. Thus, Howard return to the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] teams after signing with [[Atlanta Hawks]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/finals2009/ |title=NBA.com: Finals 2009 |accessdate=2008-05-17 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203184144/http://www.nba.com/finals2009/ |archivedate=2010-12-03 }}\n*[http://espn.go.com/nba/playoffs/2009/matchup/_/teams/magic-lakers 2009 NBA Finals at ESPN]\n*[https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_2009_finals.html 2009 NBA Finals at Basketball Reference]\n\n{{NBA Finals}}\n{{Los Angeles Lakers 2008\u201309 NBA champions}}\n{{Los Angeles Lakers}}\n{{Orlando Magic}}\n{{2008-09 NBA season by team}}\n{{NBA on ABC}}\n\n[[Category:National Basketball Association Finals]]\n[[Category:National Basketball Association controversies]]\n[[Category:2008\u201309 NBA season|Finals]]\n[[Category:Los Angeles Lakers games|NBA]]\n[[Category:Orlando Magic games|NBA]]\n[[Category:Sports competitions in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Sports competitions in Orlando, Florida]]\n[[Category:2009 in sports in Florida]]\n[[Category:2009 in sports in California]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:2009 in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:2000s in Orlando, Florida]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=June 2010}}\n{{NBA Finals summary\n| image = 2009 NBA Finals.png\n| league = NBA\n| year = 2009\n| runnerup = [[Orlando Magic]]\n| runnerup_coach = [[Stan Van Gundy]]\n| runnerup_games = 1\n| champion = [[Los Angeles Lakers]]\n| champion_coach = [[Phil Jackson]]\n| champion_games = 4\n| date = June 4\u201314\n| MVP = [[Kobe Bryant]]<br>(Los Angeles Lakers)\n| television = [[NBA on ABC|ABC]] (U.S.)<br> [[The Sports Network|TSN]] (Canada)\n| announcers = [[Mike Breen]], [[Jeff Van Gundy]] and [[Mark Jackson (basketball)|Mark Jackson]]\n| HOFers = '''Lakers:'''<br>Kobe Bryant (2020)<br>'''Coaches:'''<br>Phil Jackson (2007)\n| radio_network = [[NBA on ESPN Radio|ESPN]]\n| radio_announcers = [[Mike Tirico]], [[Hubie Brown]] and [[Jack Ramsay]]\n| referees_1 = [[Dan Crawford (basketball referee)|Dan Crawford]], [[Joe DeRosa (referee)|Joe DeRosa]], [[Ken Mauer]]\n| referees_2 = [[Steve Javie]], [[Monty McCutchen]], Tom Washington\n| referees_3 = [[Joe Crawford (basketball, born 1951)|Joe Crawford]], Derrick Stafford, Mark Wunderlich\n| referees_4 = [[Bennett Salvatore]], Mike Callahan, Scott Foster\n| referees_5 = [[Dan Crawford (basketball referee)|Dan Crawford]], [[Joe DeRosa (referee)|Joe DeRosa]], [[Ken Mauer]]\n| ECF result = [[2008\u201309 Orlando Magic season|Magic]] defeated [[2008\u201309 Cleveland Cavaliers season|Cavaliers]], 4\u20132\n| WCF result = [[2008\u201309 Los Angeles Lakers season|Lakers]] defeated [[2008\u201309 Denver Nuggets season|Nuggets]], 4\u20132\n}}\n\nThe '''2009 NBA Finals''' was the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA)'s championship series for the [[2008\u201309 NBA season|2008\u201309 season]].

The NBA Finals were staged under a 2\u20133\u20132 rotation, with the Lakers holding [[home advantage|home-court advantage]] as they had a better regular season record than the Magic.\n\n[[Kobe Bryant]] led the team to a Game 1 win with 40 points, eight rebounds, and eight assists. Game 2 was a high-scoring affair that the Lakers ultimately won on both strong defensive play and last minute heroics by Bryant, [[Derek Fisher]], and [[Pau Gasol]] during the overtime. A record-breaking performance from the Magic's 65% team shooting ensured the team a Game 3 win and the first Finals victory in franchise history. Although they trailed the Magic as much as 12 at halftime, the Lakers won Game 4 in overtime on the back of [[Trevor Ariza]]'s 13 points in the second half and Fisher's pair of three-point clutch shots. Dominant offensive play coupled with a spectacular defense by both starters and reserves from the second quarter until the buzzer helped the Lakers to win Game 5 and secure the series. Bryant was named [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] of the Finals.\n\nRodd Houston narrated the Lakers' 2009 season through the Lakers 2009 championship home video on [[NBA Entertainment]].

They played three physical series against the [[Utah Jazz]], [[Houston Rockets]], and [[Denver Nuggets]], winning in 5, 7, and 6 games, respectively. Going into the Finals, the Lakers finished off the Nuggets in the Western Conference Finals with two good performances in games 5 and 6, making analysts pick them as the favorites in the Finals. It marked a record-extending sixth Finals appearance of the decade and a record-extending 30th Finals appearance overall, the most for any NBA team.\n\n===Orlando Magic===\n{{Main|2008\u201309 Orlando Magic season}}\nThe [[Orlando Magic|Magic]] were overlooked by many to even reach the Eastern Conference Finals, as they played in the shadows of the #1-seeded [[Cleveland Cavaliers]], led by regular-season [[NBA MVP|MVP]] [[LeBron James]], and defending champion #2-seed [[Boston Celtics]]. However, after dispatching the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in six games, the Magic stunned the Celtics by winning [[List of NBA game sevens|Game 7]] in [[Boston]]. The Celtics were previously 32\u20130 when leading a series 3\u20132, and 17\u20133 previously in Game 7s at home. Orlando assistant coach [[Patrick Ewing]] had publicly \"guaranteed\" that Orlando would win game 7.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/recap;_ylt=AlT7qdkLBThF5x98WEzpSs.8vLYF?gid=2009051702&prov=ap|title=Magic Moment: Orlando beats Boston to advance|first=Jimmy|last=Golen|date=May 18, 2009|agency=Associated Press|work=Yahoo.com|quote=Magic assistant coach Patrick Ewing had guaranteed a victory. But Celtics coach [[Doc Rivers]], who had been Ewing\u2019s teammate with the New York Knicks, laughed it off.| accessdate= 29 July 2009 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref>\n\nIn the next round, Orlando was given little chance by many to defeat the top-seeded Cleveland Cavaliers, but a combination of three-point shooting and the inside presence of [[Dwight Howard]] created a matchup nightmare for Cleveland on defense, and Orlando ultimately won in six games. In Game 6, Howard's stellar performance with 40 points and 14 rebounds helped the franchise earn its second Finals appearance (they were swept by the [[Houston Rockets]] in the {{nbafy|1995}} Finals during [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and [[Penny Hardaway]] era).\n\n===Series preview===\nAlthough the Magic won both regular-season matchups with the Lakers, Los Angeles was able to take 4 out of 5 games in this series. Both regular-season games and three of the NBA Finals games were close contests, decided by six points or fewer or in overtime. The Lakers won Game 2 on June 7 101\u201396 in overtime. Then they won Game 4 on June 11 in overtime as well.\n\n[[Tyronn Lue]], a backup point guard with Orlando, appeared with the Lakers during their initial championship run in the early 2000s and faced his former team in the finals. Lue and another backup point guard, [[Anthony Johnson (basketball)|Anthony Johnson]] were the only players on Orlando's roster with NBA finals experience. However, neither saw playing time during the series, as Lue was inactive with an injury and Johnson lost his minutes to teammate [[Jameer Nelson]], who returned from a shoulder injury in time for the Finals, where he lead the Magic to sweep the Lakers in regular season. [[Trevor Ariza]], the Lakers starting small forward, faced the team who traded him to the Lakers in 2007.\n\n====Regular-season series====\nThe [[Orlando Magic]] won both games in the regular-season series:\n{{basketballbox\n| bg=#fff\n| date = December 20, 2008\n| report = {{NBA Recap|2008|1220|id=LALORL}}\n| team1 = [[Los Angeles Lakers]] |score1=103 \n| team2 = '''[[Orlando Magic]] |score2=106'''\n| place = [[Amway Arena]], [[Orlando, Florida]]\n}}\n{{basketballbox\n| date = January 16, 2009\n| report = {{NBA Recap|2009|0116|id=ORLLAL}}\n| team1 = '''[[Orlando Magic]] |score1=109'''\n| team2 = [[Los Angeles Lakers]] |score2=103\n| place = [[Staples Center]], [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]]\n}}\n\n==Game summaries==\n:''All times are in [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Daylight Time]] ([[UTC\u22124]]).''\n\n===Game 1===\n{{basketballbox|bg=#eee |date=June 4 |time=9:00 p.m. |place=[[Staples Center]], [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]] |TV=[[NBA on ABC|ABC]]\n|team1=[[Orlando Magic]] |score1=75\n|team2='''[[Los Angeles Lakers]]''' |score2='''100'''\n|Q1='''24'''\u201322 |Q2=19\u2013'''31''' |Q3=15\u2013'''29''' |Q4=17\u2013'''18'''\n|points1=[[Micka\u00ebl Pi\u00e9trus]] 14 |points2=[[Kobe Bryant]] 40\n|rebounds1=[[Dwight Howard]] 15 |rebounds2=[[Lamar Odom]] 14\n|assist1=[[Jameer Nelson]] 4 |assist2=[[Kobe Bryant]] 8\n|report={{NBA Recap|2009|0604|id=ORLLAL}}<br />{{YouTube|ImYGQWmK9ho|Video highlights}}\n|attendance=18,997\n|referee = \n* No. 43 [[Dan Crawford (basketball referee)|Dan Crawford]]\n* No. 14 [[Joe DeRosa (referee)|Joe DeRosa]]\n* No. 41 [[Ken Mauer]]\n|series=L.A.

Down 33\u201328 with 8:38 left in the 2nd quarter, the Lakers went on a 10\u20130 run and never looked back. The Lakers ended the 3rd quarter on a 25\u201310 run, led by the fierce play from [[Kobe Bryant]], who finished with 40 points, 8 rebounds, and 8 assists, joining the likes of [[Shaquille O'Neal]], [[Michael Jordan]], and [[Jerry West]] to put up those numbers in a single NBA Finals game. The 25-point margin of victory was the 6th-largest in NBA Finals Game 1 history.\n\nDue to stellar defense by the Lakers, Dwight Howard was a dismal 1\u20136 from the field, his fewest made field goals in his playoff career, and finished with 12 points, 10 of which came from free throws. The Magic shot only 29.9% (23\u201377) from the field, the second lowest percentage in the NBA Finals.\n\n===Game 2===\n{{basketballbox|bg=#eee |date=June 7 |time=8:00 p.m. |place=[[Staples Center]], [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]] |TV=[[NBA on ABC|ABC]]\n|team1=[[Orlando Magic]] |score1=96\n|team2='''[[Los Angeles Lakers]]''' |score2='''101'''\n|Q1=15\u201315 |Q2=20\u2013'''25''' |Q3='''30'''\u201323 |Q4=23\u2013'''25''' |OT=8\u2013'''13'''\n|points1=[[Rashard Lewis]] 34 |points2=[[Kobe Bryant]] 29\n|rebounds1=[[Dwight Howard]] 16 |rebounds2=[[Pau Gasol]] 10\n|assist1=[[Rashard Lewis]] 7 |assist2=[[Kobe Bryant]] 8\n|report={{NBA Recap|2009|0607|id=ORLLAL}}<br />{{YouTube|saSgjfA5x9Q|Video highlights}}\n|attendance=18,997\n|referee = \n* No. 29 [[Steve Javie]]\n* No. 13 [[Monty McCutchen]]\n* No. 49 Tom Washington\n|series=L.A.

The Lakers picked up the pace in the 2nd quarter, but [[Rashard Lewis]] kept the Magic in the game, scoring 18 of the team's 20 points in the quarter, including the final 16, on his way to a playoff career-high and Finals franchise-high 34 points for the game. The Magic outscored the Lakers in the 3rd quarter to take a 2-point lead in the 4th.\n\nWith the game tied at 84, Rashard Lewis hit a jumper with 1:32 remaining to give the Magic a 2-point lead. Kobe Bryant responded with a jumper of his own to tie the game. With 47 seconds left, [[Hedo T\u00fcrko\u011flu]] hit a jumper that was originally called a 3-pointer. However, replay showed that his foot was on the line, giving the Magic a 2-point lead. With 33 seconds remaining, [[Dwight Howard]] was able to deflect, but not steal, a [[Derek Fisher]] pass, and [[Pau Gasol]] was able to again tie the game at 88 with a layup.\n\nOn the ensuing Magic possession, the Lakers played great defense and forced [[Courtney Lee]] to miss an awkward layup shot with 10.5 seconds left. With a chance to take a 2\u20130 series lead, Kobe Bryant was blocked on a jumper by T\u00fcrko\u011flu, who gained control of the ball and called time-out with 0.6 seconds left. After another timeout, T\u00fcrko\u011flu threw a half-court lob to Courtney Lee, who had come free after a screen on his defender. However, Lee was traveling too fast and launched his layup from almost behind the backboard, causing it to miss.\n\nWith the Lakers up 1 in overtime with 1:55 left, Derek Fisher stole a [[J. J. Redick]] pass and was fouled on the ensuing fastbreak, making both free throws. After the Magic were unable to convert, Kobe Bryant made a pivotal assist to Pau Gasol for a layup-and-one, giving the Lakers a 6-point lead and the eventual victory.\n\n===Game 3===\n{{basketballbox|bg=#eee |date=June 9 |time=9:00 p.m. |place=[[Amway Arena]], [[Orlando, Florida]] |TV=[[NBA on ABC|ABC]]\n|team1=[[Los Angeles Lakers]] |score1=104\n|team2='''[[Orlando Magic]]''' |score2='''108'''\n|Q1='''31'''\u201327|Q2=23\u2013'''32''' |Q3=21\u2013'''22''' |Q4='''29'''\u201327\n|points1=[[Kobe Bryant]] 31 |points2=[[Dwight Howard|Howard]], [[Rashard Lewis|Lewis]] 21 each\n|rebounds1=[[Trevor Ariza]] 7 |rebounds2=[[Dwight Howard]] 14\n|assist1=[[Kobe Bryant]] 8 |assist2=[[Hedo T\u00fcrko\u011flu]] 7\n|report={{NBA Recap|2009|0609|id=LALORL}}<br />{{YouTube|L9TS1M7LL6k|Video highlights}}\n|attendance=17,461\n|referee = \n* No. 17 [[Joe Crawford (basketball, born 1951)|Joe Crawford]]\n* No. 9 Derrick Stafford\n* No. 18 [[Mark Wunderlich]]\n|series=L.A.

This also included a 75% first quarter, also a Finals record. However, despite the incredible shooting percentage, the Lakers managed to stay close for much of the game. The game was only sealed for the Magic on a Mikael Pietrus steal from Kobe Bryant in the waning minute of the 4th quarter.\n\nThis win marked the first Finals win in Magic franchise history, losing their first 6 Finals games (being swept in their first appearance and losing Games 1 and 2)\n\n===Game 4===\n{{basketballbox|bg=#eee |date=June 11 |time=9:00 p.m. |place=[[Amway Arena]], [[Orlando, Florida]] |TV=[[NBA on ABC|ABC]]\n|team1='''[[Los Angeles Lakers]]''' |score1='''99''' \n|team2=[[Orlando Magic]] |score2=91\n|Q1=20\u2013'''24''' |Q2=17\u2013'''25''' |Q3='''30'''\u201314 |Q4=20\u2013'''24''' |OT='''12'''\u20134\n|points1=[[Kobe Bryant]] 32 |points2=[[Hedo T\u00fcrko\u011flu]] 25\n|rebounds1=[[Pau Gasol]] 10 |rebounds2=[[Dwight Howard]] 21\n|assist1=[[Kobe Bryant]] 8 |assist2=[[Rashard Lewis]] 4\n|report={{NBA Recap|2009|0611|id=LALORL}}<br />{{YouTube|o4xg3TyVV_Y|Video highlights}}\n|attendance=17,461\n|referee = \n* No. 24 Mike Callahan\n* No. 48 [[Scott Foster (referee)|Scott Foster]]\n* No. 15 [[Bennett Salvatore]]\n|series=L.A. Lakers leads series, 3\u20131\n}}\n\nComing off their franchise's first NBA Finals game victory, the Magic quickly took the lead in the first quarter. However, [[Kobe Bryant]] kept the Lakers in the game, scoring 13 of the team's 20 first-quarter points. [[Dwight Howard]] played a great first quarter, with 11 rebounds and 4 blocks in the opening frame. In addition, he drew many fouls, putting [[Andrew Bynum]], [[Pau Gasol]], and [[Lamar Odom]] in foul trouble and forcing Lakers coach [[Phil Jackson]] to use [[Josh Powell]] and [[D. J. Mbenga]] early in the game. The Magic were able to increase the lead to 12 at halftime.\n\nThe Lakers came out of the locker room aggressive and outscored the Magic 30\u201314 in the 3rd quarter, led by [[Trevor Ariza]], who scored 13 points in the quarter, including two 3-pointers. Down by 6 in the opening minutes of the 4th quarter, the Magic were able to come back to take a 76\u201375 lead halfway through the quarter, but unable to increase the lead due to poor free-throw shooting, specifically from [[Hedo T\u00fcrko\u011flu]] and [[Dwight Howard]].\n\nWith 3 minutes left in the 4th quarter and the game tied at 79, Howard converted a 3-point play to give the Magic an 82\u201379 lead. On the next Laker possession, the Magic played good defense, but Trevor Ariza was able to hit a 3-pointer as the shot clock expired to tie the game at 82. After Hedo T\u00fcrko\u011flu hit a stepback 3-point shot, Howard blocked Gasol's jumper, giving him a single-game NBA Finals record with 9 blocked shots. On the bench to witness it was a previous record holder, his assistant coach [[Patrick Ewing]], who had 8 in Game 5 of the [[1994 NBA Finals]] while with the [[New York Knicks]]. T\u00fcrko\u011flu made another jumper with 1:34 remaining to give the Magic a 5-point lead.\n\nDown 87\u201382 with 31 seconds left, [[Kobe Bryant]] spun through the lane and passed to Gasol for a dunk to cut the lead to 3. On the next Magic possession, Howard was fouled by Bryant with 11 seconds remaining. Needing just one free-throw to make the game a 2-possession affair, Howard missed both shots.\n\nOut of the timeout, the Lakers elected to take the ball out at three-quarters court instead of half-court in order to space out the floor. The Magic double-teamed Bryant in the backcourt, allowing him to pass the ball up to Ariza, who in turned passed it to [[Derek Fisher]] on the right wing. Having missed his first five 3-point shots of the game, Fisher spotted up and hit a pivotal three-pointer over Jameer Nelson to tie the game at 87 with 4.6 seconds left. On the final possession of regulation, [[Micka\u00ebl Pi\u00e9trus]] missed a 20-footer.\n\nThe overtime session began with a 3-pointer by [[Rashard Lewis]] and two contested jumpers by [[Kobe Bryant]] to give the Lakers a 91\u201390 lead. With 1:27 left in OT, Howard split a pair of free throws to tie the game at 91. On the next possession, the Lakers would miss a layup and a jumper, but regained possession on an offensive rebound by Ariza and a loose-ball foul on [[Jameer Nelson]]. With 31 seconds left, Kobe Bryant passed out of a double-team with the controversy of no called on Jameer Nelson after being knocked out by Kobe Bryant. Before, Fisher then hit a 3-pointer to give the Lakers a 94\u201391 lead.\n\nOut of a timeout, T\u00fcrko\u011flu rushed a 3-point shot and missed. Rashard Lewis backtapped the rebound to center-court, but the ball went to Pau Gasol, who ran in unimpeded for a dunk, giving the Lakers the lead for good. In the next possession, the Magic missed another shot, bouncing the ball to Fisher, who passed it to Ariza, then to Gasol for a dunk, but Pietrus slammed both arms on his back, resulting in Gasol getting a technical foul and Pietrus a flagrant 1 foul.\n\nAfter coming so close, the Magic lost a chance to tie the series, a fact not lost upon the arena staff in Orlando. Upon the game's finish, [[Oasis (band)|Oasis's]] \"[[Don't Look Back in Anger]]\" was played throughout Amway Arena.\n\n===Game 5===\n{{basketballbox|bg=#eee |date=June 14 |time=8:00 p.m. |place=[[Amway Center]], [[Orlando, Florida]] |TV=[[NBA on ABC|ABC]]\n|team1='''[[Los Angeles Lakers]]''' |score1='''99'''\n|team2=[[Orlando Magic]] |score2= 86\n|report={{NBA Recap|2009|0614|id=LALORL}}<br />{{YouTube|u_qNvMeVsZc|Video highlights}}\n|Q1=26\u2013'''28''' |Q2='''30'''\u201318 |Q3='''20'''\u201315 |Q4=23\u2013'''25'''\n|points1=[[Kobe Bryant]] 30 |points2=[[Rashard Lewis]] 18\n|rebounds1=[[Pau Gasol]] 15 |rebounds2=[[Dwight Howard|Howard]], [[Rashard Lewis|Lewis]] 10 each\n|assist1=[[Kobe Bryant]] 5 |assist2=[[Rashard Lewis|Lewis]], [[Jameer Nelson|Nelson]] 4 each\n|attendance=17,461\n|referee= \n* No. 43 [[Dan Crawford (basketball referee)|Dan Crawford]]\n* No. 14 [[Joe DeRosa (referee)|Joe DeRosa]]\n* No. 41 [[Ken Mauer]]\n|series=L.A.

In the opening frame, all 5 starters scored and assisted on at least one field goal, but the Lakers pulled to within 2 at the quarter break. Down 40\u201336 with 7:11 in the 2nd quarter, the Lakers went on a 16\u20130 run, fueled by two 3-pointers and solid defensive play from [[Trevor Ariza]]. The Lakers led by as much as 12 in the 2nd quarter and the score was 56\u201346 at halftime.\n\nComing out of the half, Orlando cut the lead to 5 with 7:45 remaining in the 3rd on a 3-pointer by [[Rafer Alston]]. [[Lamar Odom]] answered with back-to-back 3-pointers to restore the Laker lead to double digits. Leading by as much as 18 in the half, Los Angeles led by 15 going into the 4th quarter. In the final quarter, Orlando attempted a run but managed to cut the lead down to only 12; at the buzzer, the Lakers celebrated their 15th title.<ref>{{cite web|first=Tom|last=Withers|title=Bryant, Lakers reign once more|url=http://www.nba.com/games/20090614/LALORL/recap.html|publisher=[[National Basketball Association]]|date=2009-06-14|accessdate=2009-06-15|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618135606/http://www.nba.com/games/20090614/LALORL/recap.html|archivedate=18 June 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the game, NBA Commissioner [[David Stern]] presented the Lakers with the [[Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy]] and presented [[Kobe Bryant]] with the [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|Bill Russell NBA Finals MVP Trophy]] during a presentation on center-court at [[Amway Arena]]. Bryant averaged 32.4 points, 5.6 rebounds and 7.4 assists per game during the series.\n\n==Statistics==\n{{listen\n|filename=Welcoming The Lakers To The White House (1-25-10) Barack Obama.ogv\n|title=January 25, 2010 White House Visit\n|description=On January 25, 2010, [[Barack Obama]] hosted the [[2008\u201309 Los Angeles Lakers season|2008\u201309 Los Angeles Lakers]] at the [[White House]] following their victory in the 2009 NBA Finals to end the [[2008\u201309 NBA season]].\n|filetype=[[Ogv]]}}\nThe series was the third straight championship that the Lakers clinched on the road (after [[2001 NBA Finals|2001]] and [[2002 NBA Finals|2002]]); the last time the Lakers clinched the championship at home was in [[2000 NBA Finals|2000]]. With their team's win, [[Pau Gasol]] became the first [[Spain|Spaniard]], and [[D. J. Mbenga]] the first [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] player, to win an NBA championship. [[Bill Walton|Bill]] and [[Luke Walton]] became the third father and son pair to each win a championship as a player; the other father\u2013son combinations are [[Matt Guokas, Sr.]] ([[1947 NBA Finals|1947]]) with [[Matt Guokas|Matt Jr.]] ([[1967 NBA Finals|1967]]) and [[Rick Barry]] ([[1975 NBA Finals|1975]]) with son [[Brent Barry|Brent]] ([[2005 NBA Finals|2005]] and [[2007 NBA Finals|2007]]). [[Kobe Bryant]] averaged 32.4 points and 7.4 assists in this series, which was the best combination of those categories since [[Jerry West]] averaged 37.9 points and 7.4 assists ([[1969 NBA Finals|1969]]).\n\nFor the Magic, Game 3 marked their first Finals game victory; the franchise lost their first six Finals games after being swept in their first Finals appearance in [[1995 NBA Finals|1995]]. In Game 3, the Magic also set the Finals record for the best [[Field goal (basketball)|field goal]] percentage with 63 percent, and the Finals record for the best field goal percentage in the first half with 75 percent.\n\nThis was the first NBA Finals series since [[1984 NBA Finals|1984]] to have two games go into overtime (Games 2 and 4); both were won by the Lakers. [[Dwight Howard]] set an NBA Finals single-game record with 9 blocked shots in Game 4. The previous record holders, all of whom had blocked eight shots in a Finals game,<ref>http://www.nba.com/history/records/finals_game_blockedshots.html</ref> were: [[Bill Walton]] of the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] in Game 6 of the [[1977 NBA Finals]]; [[Hakeem Olajuwon]] of the [[Houston Rockets]] in Game 5 of the [[1986 NBA Finals]]; Howard's assistant coach [[Patrick Ewing]] of the [[New York Knicks]] in Game 5 of the [[1994 NBA Finals]]; [[Shaquille O'Neal]] of the Los Angeles Lakers in Game 2 of the [[2001 NBA Finals]]; and [[Tim Duncan]] of the [[San Antonio Spurs]] in Game 6 of the [[2003 NBA Finals]].\n\nThis is the seventh time in NBA Finals history that a team that lost the championship the previous season has won the Finals the very next year. It is the second time in Lakers history, after the [[1984 NBA Finals|1984]] and [[1985 NBA Finals|1985]] teams.\n\nThis is also the first odd season since 2001 that the [[San Antonio Spurs]] did not win the NBA Finals; they won in [[2003 NBA Finals|2003]], [[2005 NBA Finals|2005]] and [[2007 NBA Finals|2007]].\n\nThis was the last Finals in which a trophy silhouette was painted in mid-court. The tradition began in [[2005 NBA Finals|2005]] and ended for the [[2010 NBA Finals|2010]] series. This was also the last NBA Finals to be played at [[Amway Arena]]; the Magic moved to the [[Amway Center]] for the [[2010-11 NBA season|2010-11 season]].\n \n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:left;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=3|Category !!rowspan=2 colspan=2|High !!colspan=4|Average\n|-\n! colspan=2|[[Los Angeles Lakers]] !! colspan=2|[[Orlando Magic]]\n|-\n!Player !!

The championship was the fourth of the 2000s decade for the Lakers, most among all teams in the four major professional sports leagues in North America. No other NBA team had won at least four titles during this same time period. Therefore, the Los Angeles Lakers can be referred to as the \"Team of the 2000s\".\n\nBy virtue of their win this year and loss in the previous year, this marked tenth occurrence that the winners of the NBA Finals were losers in the preceding year's Finals, previously the [[Detroit Pistons]] had lost and won the Finals in {{nbafy|1988}} and {{nbafy|1989}} respectively. The victory was noted by many as a personal success for Finals MVP [[Kobe Bryant]], winning his first championship and succeeding in the playoffs without the presence of former Lakers center [[Shaquille O'Neal]] where some people had previously speculated that Bryant could not \"win one without Shaq\". Head coach [[Phil Jackson]] captured his 10th NBA championship as a coach, surpassing [[Red Auerbach]] for most championships all-time by an NBA coach. Jackson also passed Auerbach and [[NHL]] coach [[Scotty Bowman]] for most championships all-time by a head coach in a major American sports league. Having achieved three Game 1 victories throughout the postseason (first round vs. [[Utah Jazz|Utah]], conference finals vs. [[Denver Nuggets|Denver]], and NBA Finals vs. Orlando), Phil Jackson-coached teams were now 44\u20130 in series where they win the first game, later improved to 48-0 by the time Jackson retired after the [[2011 NBA Playoffs]].\n\nThe Lakers' only offseason change was the acquisition of [[Ron Artest]] from the [[Houston Rockets]], in an essential trade where they let [[Trevor Ariza]] sign with the Rockets. Again the Lakers won the top seed in the West, though winning just eight games less than the year before. They eliminated the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]] in six, the [[Utah Jazz]] in four, and the [[Phoenix Suns]] in six to return to the NBA Finals and renew their [[Celtics-Lakers rivalry|heated rivalry with the Celtics]]. In the Finals the Lakers won a hard-fought seven game series against the Celtics to retain the NBA title, becoming the first team to repeat as champions since the [[2001-02 Los Angeles Lakers season|2002 Lakers]].\n\n===Magic===\nThe Magic again won 59 games and the division title in the [[2009-10 NBA season|2009-10 season]], in which they let go of [[Hedo T\u00fcrko\u011flu]] to the [[Toronto Raptors]] and acquired [[Vince Carter]] from the [[New Jersey Nets]]. Dwight Howard won [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award|Defensive Player of the Year]] for the second straight year. In the [[2010 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] the Magic swept the [[Charlotte Bobcats]] and the [[Atlanta Hawks]], becoming the first team in NBA history to win their first eight playoff games by 20 or more points. However, the Magic would lose to the [[Boston Celtics]] in six games of the Eastern Conference Finals, marking the final games held at [[Amway Arena]]. The Magic moved to the [[Amway Center]] the next season, then proceeded to lose in the first round for two straight years to the Hawks and the [[Indiana Pacers]], respectively. After the [[2011\u201312 NBA season|2011\u201312 season]] Stan Van Gundy was fired, and in a blockbuster offseason trade, Howard was traded to the Lakers, which he spent one season with the Lakers and later move to [[Houston Rockets]]. However, the team failed to reach [[NBA Finals]] due to the rise of the [[Golden State Warriors]]. Thus, Howard return to the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] teams after signing with [[Atlanta Hawks]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/finals2009/ |title=NBA.com: Finals 2009 |accessdate=2008-05-17 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203184144/http://www.nba.com/finals2009/ |archivedate=2010-12-03 }}\n*[http://espn.go.com/nba/playoffs/2009/matchup/_/teams/magic-lakers 2009 NBA Finals at ESPN]\n*[https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_2009_finals.html 2009 NBA Finals at Basketball Reference]\n\n{{NBA Finals}}\n{{Los Angeles Lakers 2008\u201309 NBA champions}}\n{{Los Angeles Lakers}}\n{{Orlando Magic}}\n{{2008-09 NBA season by team}}\n{{NBA on ABC}}\n\n[[Category:National Basketball Association Finals]]\n[[Category:National Basketball Association controversies]]\n[[Category:2008\u201309 NBA season|Finals]]\n[[Category:Los Angeles Lakers games|NBA]]\n[[Category:Orlando Magic games|NBA]]\n[[Category:Sports competitions in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Sports competitions in Orlando, Florida]]\n[[Category:2009 in sports in Florida]]\n[[Category:2009 in sports in California]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:2009 in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:2000s in Orlando, Florida]]\n", "name_user": "Aroundthewayboy", "label": "safe", "comment": "past tense of 'lead' is 'led'", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_NBA_Finals"}

A ''[[cento (poetry)|cento]]'' is a poetic work composed of verses or passages taken from other authors and re-arranged in a new order. This poem reworks verses extracted from the work of [[Virgil]] to tell stories from the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]] of the Christian [[Bible]]. Much of the work focuses on the [[Life of Jesus in the New Testament|story of Jesus Christ]].\n\nWhile scholars have proposed a number of hypotheses to explain why the poem was written, a definitive answer to this question remains elusive. Regardless of Proba's intent, the poem would go on to be widely circulated, and it eventually was used in schools to teach the tenets of Christianity, often alongside [[Augustine of Hippo]]'s ''[[De doctrina Christiana]]''. But while the poem was popular, critical reception was more mixed. A pseudonymous work purportedly by [[Pope Gelasius I]] disparaged the poem, deeming it [[apocryphal]], and many also believe that St. [[Jerome]] wrote negatively of Proba and her poem. Other thinkers like [[Isidore of Seville]], [[Petrarch]], and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] wrote highly of Proba, and many praised her ingenuity. During the 19th and 20th centuries the poem was criticized as being of poor quality, but recent scholars have held the work in higher regard.\n\n==Origin and style==\n\n{{Multiple image| total_width = 500|image1=Boccaccio - Faltonia Proba - De mulieribus claris, XV secolo illuminated manuscript.jpg|alt1=Illuminated depiction of Faltonia Proba|image2=Parco della Grotta di Posillipo5 (crop).jpg|alt2=Presumed marble bust of Virgil|footer=''Cento Vergilianus de laudibus Christi'' was arranged by Faltonia Betitia Proba (''left'') almost entirely from the works of the Roman poet [[Virgil]] (''right'').}}\n\nThe author of the poem, [[Faltonia Betitia Proba]], was born {{circa}} AD 322.

This is because Virgil never used Hebrew names like \"Jesus\" and \"Mary\", and thus Proba was limited in terms of what she was able to work with. To compensate, Proba used vague words like ''mater'' (\"mother\"), ''pater'' (\"father\"), ''deus'' (\"god\"), and ''vates'' (\"poet\" or \"priest\") to refer to key Judeo-Christian figures.<ref name=kastner39/> In places, this handicap interferes with readability (according to G.

According to the classicist [[Karla Pollmann]], by using lines that concern destruction and the establishment of law, Proba is able to convey the traditional idea that Noah's survival represents the dawning of a \"second creation and a new order\" (that is, the [[Patriarchal age]]).<ref>[[#Pollmann|Pollmann (2017)]], p. 113.</ref> Proba dedicates only a few lines to Exodus before moving onto the New Testament. Cullhed reasons that this is because the Book of Exodus and the remaining Old Testament is replete with violence and warfare that is stylistically too close to the tradition of pagan epic poetry{{em dash}}a tradition that Proba expressly rejects in the proem of ''De laudibus Christi''.<ref>[[#Cullhed|Cullhed (2015)]], p. 121.</ref> In the transitional section between the Old and New Testaments, Proba appropriates the invocation of the Muses of war that immediately precedes the Catalogue of Italians (from Book VII, ''Aeneid'') and verses that originally described Aeneas's prophetic shield (from Book VIII, ''Aeneid''). According to Culhed, these verses originally functioned as poetic devices, enabling Virgil to move from the \"Odyssean\" first half of the poem to the \"Iliadic\" latter half. Proba likewise has re-purposed these verses to aid in her transition from the Old Testament into the New.<ref>[[#Cullhed|Cullhed (2015)]], pp. 122{{en dash}}23.</ref>\n\nThe portion of ''De laudibus Christi'' that focuses on the New Testament recounts the [[Nativity of Christ|birth of Jesus]], his [[Life of Jesus in the New Testament|life and deeds]], his [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]], and the advent of the [[Holy Spirit]].<ref name=mcl2008p5/><ref name=InfIonLine.net/><ref name=mcl2008p4>[[#M\u0103rmureanu|M\u0103rmureanu, Cernescu, and Lixandru (2008)]], p. 4.</ref> Although Jesus and [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] are featured, [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] is omitted.<ref>[[#Cullhed|Cullhed (2015)]], p. 164.</ref> Jesus is often described by language befitting a Virgilian hero,<ref>[[#Cullhed|Cullhed (2015)]], pp. 158, 176{{en dash}}83.</ref> and Mary is depicted by lines originally relating to [[Venus (goddess)|Venus]] and Dido.<ref name=c164165/> Proba's [[Sermon on the Mount]] begins by borrowing the [[Sibyl of Cumae]]'s description of punishment for the unrighteous (from Book VI, ''Aeneid''), and some scholars contend that this portion of ''De laudibus Christi'' is the first description of [[Hell#Christianity|hell]] in Christian poetry.<ref>[[#Cullhed|Cullhed (2015)]], pp. 169{{en dash}}70.</ref> Christ's deeds are reduced to three events: [[Calming the storm|calming the sea]], [[Jesus walking on water|walking on water]], and the [[First disciples of Jesus|call of the disciples]].<ref>[[#Cullhed|Cullhed (2015)]], p. 176.</ref> To describe Christ's crucifixion, Proba uses several lines that originally related to warfare, destruction, and death, such as the battle between Aeneas and the Rutuli (from Book XII, ''Aeneid''), the [[Trojan War#Sack of Troy|Sack of Troy]] (from Book II), and the suffocation of Laoco\u00f6n by giant serpents (from Book II).<ref>[[#Cullhed|Cullhed (2015)]], p. 181{{en dash}}82.</ref> Notably, Christ is crucified not on a cross, but an oak tree, which Cullhed argues \"synthesizes Jewish, Roman and Christian religious codes\", as the species of tree was associated in the Greco-Roman world with Jupiter, and in the Judeo-Christian tradition with the [[Binding of Isaac]].<ref>[[#Cullhed|Cullhed (2015)]], p. 182.</ref> After covering Christ's death, Proba borrows lines referring to the erotic love between Dido and [[Aeneas]] to represent the decidedly more spiritual love that Christ shares with his disciples.<ref>[[#Cullhed|Cullhed (2015)]], p. 184.</ref> The end of the poem focuses on Christ describing the world to come and his [[Ascension of Jesus|ascension into Heaven]]; Proba conveys the former via the prophecy made by both [[Celaeno]] and the [[Delos|Oracle of Delos]] (both from Book III, ''Aeneid''), and the latter with language that originally described the god [[Mercury (god)|Mercury]].<ref>[[#Cullhed|Cullhed (2015)]], p. 185.</ref><ref>[[#Cullhed|Cullhed (2015)]], p. 186.</ref>\n\n===Characterization of Jesus===\n\n{{multiple image| total_width = 500|image1=Christ with beard.jpg|alt1=Mural painting of a bearded Christ|image2=Aeneas and Turnus.jpg|alt2=Painting of Aeneas subduing King Turnus|footer=In the cento, [[Jesus]] (''left'') is described in language befitting a Virgilian hero like [[Aeneas]] (''right'').}}\n\nDue to her borrowing from Virgil, Proba's Christ is very similar to the Virgilian epic hero.<ref>[[#Cullhed|Cullhed (2015)]], p. 158.</ref> Parallels between the two include both seeking a goal greater than their own happiness, initiating realms \"without end\", and projecting auras of divinity.<ref name=c&h1981-31>[[#Clark|Clark & Hatch (1981)]], p. 31.</ref> According to the early Christian specialist [[Elizabeth A.

The historian Kate Cooper sees Mary as a courageous, intelligent ''materfamilias''.<ref>[[#Cooper|Cooper (2007)]], pp. 66{{en dash}}67.</ref> Clark and Hatch write that Proba stresses Mary's maternity by omitting Joseph and presenting Mary as Jesus's sole human parent. Conversely, the [[Latinist]] Stratis Kyriakidis argues that despite Mary's presence in the poem, she lacks feminine attributes, and is thus \"impersonal\".<ref name=c164165>[[#Cullhed|Cullhed (2015)]], pp. 164{{en dash}}65.</ref> According to Kyriakidis, this is intentional on Proba's part, as it draws attention to Christ's divinity{{em dash}}an aspect that \"would be incompatible with a human, feminine mother.\"<ref name=c164165/>\n\n[[File:Retable de l'Agneau mystique (3).jpg|right|thumb|alt=Painting of a woman wearing a crown and reading a book|According to Sigrid Schottenius Cullhed, Proba compares [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mary]] (''pictured'') to goddesses and prophets through the use of Virgilian language.]]\n\nCullhed writes that the most scholarly views of Mary in the poem are inadequate, and that Proba made Mary \"the twofold fulfillment and [[Typology (theology)|antitype]] of both Eve and Dido.\"<ref name=c165>[[#Cullhed|Cullhed (2015)]], p. 165.</ref> Cullhed bases this on the fact that line 563 of the fourth book of the ''Aeneid'' (from Mercury's speech to Aeneas, in which the god admonishes the hero for lingering with Dido in [[Carthage]]) is used in two of the sections of the cento: once, in which Adam admonishes Eve for sinning, and again, in which Mary learns that Herod wants to kill her child. According to Cullhed, the \"negative characterization\" of the original verse and its reuse in the Old Testament portion of the cento is transformed into a \"positively charged ability\" allowing Mary and Jesus to escape Herod's wrath.<ref name=c165/> Because Mary can foretell the future, she is compared (through the use of Virgilian language) to Greco-Roman goddesses and prophets.<ref name=c166>[[#Cullhed|Cullhed (2015)]], p. 166.</ref>\n\n==Proba's character and motivation==\n\nBecause historical information about Proba is limited, many scholars have taken to analyzing ''De laudibus Christi'' to learn more about her. According to the classicist Bernice Kaczynski, \"Scholars have seen traces of Proba's own character in her emphasis on the beauty of the natural world, readily apparent in her account of the creation.\"<ref name=Kaczynski132/> The cento suggests that Proba had great regard for \"domestic matters, for marriage and the family, for marital devotion and [for] filial piety\".<ref name=Kaczynski132/> While the New Testament stresses [[Asceticism#Christianity|asceticism]], Proba seems to de-emphasize its importance, given that topics like virginity and poverty are not stressed in her poem. In regards to issues of finance, Proba reinterprets a number of the New Testament episodes in which Jesus urges his followers to eschew wealth as passages suggesting that Christians should simply share wealth with their families. These changes illustrate Proba's historical context, her socio-economic position, and the expectations of her class.<ref name=Kaczynski132/>\n\nAs to why Proba arranged in the poem in the first place, scholars are still divided. The Latinist R. P. H. Green argues that the work was a reaction to the Roman emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]]'s law forbidding Christians from teaching literature that they did not believe to be true (which is to say, classical Greek and Latin mythology).<ref>[[#Green|Green (1995)]], pp. 555{{en dash}}58.</ref><ref name=\"Stevenson 67\">[[#Stevenson|Stevenson (2005)]], p. 67.</ref> Proba's goal, Green writes, was to present Virgil \"without [pagan] gods, and [thus] a [Virgil] no longer vulnerable to Christian criticism\".<ref name=green558>[[#Green|Green (1995)]], p. 558.</ref> In this way, a Christian teacher could use the text to discuss Virgil without compromising their religious and moral integrity.<ref name=green558/> Clark and Hatch, on the other hand, postulate that Jesus's Virgilian nature in the cento may have been Proba's attempt to rebut the unflattering, demonizing descriptions of Jesus in Julian's ''Caesares'' and ''[[Against the Galileans|Contra Galilaeos]]''. They conclude that the hypothesis is intriguing but unverifiable due to the lack of information about Proba, the date of the cento's creation, and her intentions.<ref name=c&h1981-31/><ref name=c&h1981-33/> Finally, the classicist Aurelio Amatucci suggests that Proba composed the cento to teach her children stories from the Bible,<ref>[[#Cullhed|Cullhed (2015)]], pp. 52{{en dash}}53.</ref> although there is no solid evidence that the poem was ever intended to be a teaching tool.<ref name=plant2>[[#Plant|Plant (2004)]], p. 171.</ref><ref name=mcl2008p8/><ref>[[#Cullhed|Cullhed (2015)]], p. 53.</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\nBy studying the manuscript records of [[Cloister|claustral]] libraries, scholars have concluded that Proba's cento was heavily copied upon its release. It was evidently very popular in schools, and often used alongside [[Augustine of Hippo]]'s ''[[De doctrina Christiana]]''; in some instances, Proba's work even eclipsed Augustine's in popularity. According to C\u0103t\u0103lina M\u0103rmureanu, Gianina Cernescu, and Laura Lixandru, the work was likely favored because of its accessible, Virgilian style and because Proba presented herself as  a \"meek\" female, thus appealing to the \"misogynistic views of the general public\".<ref name=mcl2008p8>[[#M\u0103rmureanu|M\u0103rmureanu, Cernescu, and Lixandru (2008)]], p. 8.</ref>\n\n[[File:Francescostjerome.jpg|thumbnail|alt=Painting of Saint Jerome, reading a book|Many scholars believe that [[Jerome]] (''pictured'') criticized the poem.]]\n\nIn the late-4th and early-5th centuries, the work began to receive a more mixed response.

''expressit'').<ref>[[Isidore of Seville]], ''[[Etymologiae]]'', I.39.26.</ref> But the classicist and [[medievalist]] Danuta Shanzer has argued that the poem was not the work of Faltonia Betitia Proba, but rather her granddaughter, [[Anicia Faltonia Proba]], who lived in the late-fourth and early-fifth centuries.<ref name=green551>[[#Green|Green (1995)]], p. 551.</ref> Shanzer{{em dash}}who is of the opinion that Faltonia Betitia Proba likely died in AD 351{{em dash}}bases much of her assertion on supposed date inconsistencies and [[anachronism]]s within the text. For instance, Shanzer points out that lines 13\u201317 of ''De laudibus Christi'' strongly resemble lines 20\u201324 of the poem ''[[Carmen contra paganos]]'', which was written sometime after Faltonia Betitia Proba's death.<ref name=green551/><ref name=listofreason/> Shanzer also claims that ''De laudibus Christi'' alludes to a notable debate about the date of [[Easter]] that took place in AD 387, thereby suggesting that the poem must date from the latter part of the fourth century. Finally, Shanzer argues that the reference to the war between Magnentius and Constantius in the work's proem precludes the possibility that Faltonia Betitia Proba arranged ''De laudibus Christi'', due to the fact that the war took place in the same year as her supposed death. Shanzer rounds out her hypothesis by also invoking a textual argument, noting that the author of ''De laudibus Christi'' is often referred to in later manuscripts by titles that only Anicia Proba would have received, such as \"mother of the Anicians\" or the \"eminent Roman Mistress\".<ref name=listofreason/>\n\nIn her 2015 book ''Proba the Prophet'', Cullhed counters Shanzer's claims, first by noting that there is no definitive evidence that Faltonia Betitia Proba died in AD 351 and that such an assertion remains speculative at best. Cullhed also argues that \"there are no 'grounds for determining priority{{'\"}} of the poem's opening lines, and that the supposed reference to the AD 387 debate about Easter could have likely referred to an earlier, perhaps less famous dispute.<ref name=listofreason/> As to the titles found in later manuscripts, Cullhed writes that it is likely that they were erroneously inserted during the Middle Ages by scribes who had understandably confused the two Probas. Cullhed also reasons that if Anicia Proba had written ''De laudibus Christi'', the [[Latin literature|Latin poet]] [[Claudian]] would have almost certainly praised her poetic abilities in his AD 395 [[panegyric]] celebrating the joint consulship of her sons [[Anicius Hermogenianus Olybrius]] and [[Anicius Probinus]].<ref name=listofreason/> Cullhed concludes: \"The evidence for discrediting Isidore's attribution [of Faltonia Betitia Proba as the author of the cento] is not sufficient, and so, I will assume that the cento was written in the mid-fourth century by Faltonia Betitia Proba.\"<ref name=listofreason>[[#Cullhed|Cullhed (2015)]], pp. 22{{en dash}}23.</ref> Today, the general consensus among classicists and scholars of Latin is that ''De laudibus Christi'' was indeed written by Faltonia Betitia Proba.<ref name=plant>[[#Plant|Plant (2004)]], p. 170.</ref><ref>[[#Cullhed|Cullhed (2015)]], p. 65.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n*''[[Interpretatio Christiana]]'', the adaptation of non-Christian elements of culture or historical facts to the worldview of Christianity\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{reflist|group=nb}}\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Balmer|first1=Josephine|title=Classical Women Poets|date=1996|publisher=[[Bloodaxe Books]]|place=[[Hexham|Hexham, UK]]|isbn=978-1-85224-342-5|ref=Balmer|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/classicalwomenpo00jose_0}}\n* {{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=[[Cyclop\u00e6dia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences]]|title=Cento|volume=1|page=180|url=http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia01|editor=Chambers, Ephraim|date=1728|publisher=J. and J.

A ''[[cento (poetry)|cento]]'' is a poetic work composed of verses or passages taken from other authors and re-arranged in a new order. This poem reworks verses extracted from the work of [[Virgil]] to tell stories from the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]] of the Christian [[Bible]]. Much of the work focuses on the [[Life of Jesus in the New Testament|story of Jesus Christ]].\n\nWhile scholars have proposed a number of hypotheses to explain why the poem was written, a definitive answer to this question remains elusive. Regardless of Proba's intent, the poem would go on to be widely circulated, and it eventually was used in schools to teach the tenets of Christianity, often alongside [[Augustine of Hippo]]'s ''[[De doctrina Christiana]]''. But while the poem was popular, critical reception was more mixed. A pseudonymous work purportedly by [[Pope Gelasius I]] disparaged the poem, deeming it [[apocryphal]], and many also believe that St. [[Jerome]] wrote negatively of Proba and her poem. Other thinkers like [[Isidore of Seville]], [[Petrarch]], and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] wrote highly of Proba, and many praised her ingenuity. During the 19th and 20th centuries the poem was criticized as being of poor quality, but recent scholars have held the work in higher regard.\n\n==Origin and style==\n\n{{Multiple image| total_width = 500|image1=Boccaccio - Faltonia Proba - De mulieribus claris, XV secolo illuminated manuscript.jpg|alt1=Illuminated depiction of Faltonia Proba|image2=Parco della Grotta di Posillipo5 (crop).jpg|alt2=Presumed marble bust of Virgil|footer=''Cento Vergilianus de laudibus Christi'' was arranged by Faltonia Betitia Proba (''left'') almost entirely from the works of the Roman poet [[Virgil]] (''right'').}}\n\nThe author of the poem, [[Faltonia Betitia Proba]], was born {{circa}} AD 322. A member of an influential, aristocratic family, she eventually married a prefect of Rome named [[Clodius Celsinus Adelphius]].<ref name=plant/><ref name=131-132k>[[#Kaczynski|Kaczynski (2013)]], pp. 131{{en dash}}32.</ref> Proba wrote poetry, and according to contemporary accounts, her first work was titled ''Constantini bellum adversus Magnentium''; this poem, which is now [[Lost work|lost]], recounted the [[Roman civil war of 350\u2013353|war]] between Roman Emperor [[Constantius II]] and the [[Roman usurper|usurper]] [[Magnentius]] that occurred between AD 350{{en dash}}53.<ref name=131-132k/><ref>[[#Cullhed|Cullhed (2015)]], p. 24.</ref> At some point, Proba converted from paganism to Christianity, and ''De laudibus Christi'', which was probably written {{circa}} AD 352{{en dash}}384,<ref name=plant/> was her attempt to \"turn away from battle and slayings in order to write holy things\".<ref name=Kaczynski132>[[#Kaczynski|Kaczynski (2013)]], p. 132.</ref>\n\nWith the exception of the [[wiktionary:proem|proem]] and invocation of the poem,{{#tag:ref|The proem and invocation are both mixes of original Latin lines and lines borrowed from or alluding to the Virgil, the [[Classical Latin#Authors of the Silver Age|Silver Age]] poet [[Lucan]], and the fourth-century poet [[Juvencus]].<ref name=cullhed113>[[#Cullhed|Cullhed (2015)]], p. 113.</ref>|group=\"nb\"}} the entirety of ''De laudibus Christi'' is a [[cento (poetry)|cento]] (i.e. a patchwork poem) made up of rearranged verses extracted from the works of the Roman poet [[Virgil]].<ref name=k131>[[#Kaczynski|Kaczynski (2013)]], p. 131.</ref><ref>[[#Cullhed|Cullhed (2015)]], p. 1.</ref>{{#tag:ref|[[Ausonius]] (AD 310{{en dash}}395) is the only poet from Antiquity to comment on the form and content of the Virgilian cento, and his statements are regarded as authoritative by many scholars.<ref name=\"McGill\">[[#McGill|McGill (2005)]], pp. 2{{en dash}}5.</ref> [[Ephraim Chambers]], in his ''[[Cyclop\u00e6dia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclop\u00e6dia]]'' (1728), [[paraphrase]]s Ausonius statements as such: A cento \"may be taken either from the same poet, or from several.

But two verses should never be us[e]d running, nor much less than half a verse be taken.\"<ref name=\"cyclo\">[[#Chambers|Chambers (1728)]], p. 180.</ref>|group=\"nb\"}} Proba's choice to rework Virgil seems to have been made for two reasons: First, Virgil was an influential poet who had been commissioned by [[Caesar Augustus]], the first Roman emperor, to write the mytho-historical epic ''[[Aeneid]]''.<ref>[[#Comparetti|Comparetti (1895)]], pp. 1{{en dash}}14.</ref> Arguably the most influential Roman poet, Virgil's artistic clout was immense, being felt well into [[late antiquity]], and he was imitated by [[Late Latin]] poets like [[Juvencus]] and [[Prudentius]].<ref>[[#Ziolkowski|Ziolkowski & Putnam (2008)]], p. 475.</ref><ref>[[#Comparetti|Comparetti (1895)]], p. 159.</ref> The respect given to Virgil often manifested in the form of centos, which reached peak popularity in the fourth century AD.<ref>[[#Ziolkowski|Ziolkowski & Putnam (2008)]], p. 469.</ref><ref>[[#Comparetti|Comparetti (1895)]], p. 53.</ref> Second, Virgil was often seen as a pre-Christian prophet due to a popular interpretation of his [[Eclogue 4|fourth Eclogue]], which many [[Christian interpretations of Virgil's Eclogue 4|believed foretold the birth of Jesus]].<ref>[[#Ziolkowski|Ziolkowski & Putnam (2008)]], p. 470.</ref><ref>[[#Comparetti|Comparetti (1895)]], p. 99.</ref>\n\nHardly any names are present in ''De laudibus Christi''. This is because Virgil never used Hebrew names like \"Jesus\" and \"Mary\", and thus Proba was limited in terms of what she was able to work with.

According to Cullhed, the \"negative characterization\" of the original verse and its reuse in the Old Testament portion of the cento is transformed into a \"positively charged ability\" allowing Mary and Jesus to escape Herod's wrath.<ref name=c165/> Because Mary can foretell the future, she is compared (through the use of Virgilian language) to Greco-Roman goddesses and prophets.<ref name=c166>[[#Cullhed|Cullhed (2015)]], p. 166.</ref>\n\n==Proba's character and motivation==\n\nBecause historical information about Proba is limited, many scholars have taken to analyzing ''De laudibus Christi'' to learn more about her. According to the classicist Bernice Kaczynski, \"Scholars have seen traces of Proba's own character in her emphasis on the beauty of the natural world, readily apparent in her account of the creation.\"<ref name=Kaczynski132/> The cento suggests that Proba had great regard for \"domestic matters, for marriage and the family, for marital devotion and [for] filial piety\".<ref name=Kaczynski132/> While the New Testament stresses [[Asceticism#Christianity|asceticism]], Proba seems to de-emphasize its importance, given that topics like virginity and poverty are not stressed in her poem. In regards to issues of finance, Proba reinterprets a number of the New Testament episodes in which Jesus urges his followers to eschew wealth as passages suggesting that Christians should simply share wealth with their families. These changes illustrate Proba's historical context, her socio-economic position, and the expectations of her class.<ref name=Kaczynski132/>\n\nAs to why Proba arranged in the poem in the first place, scholars are still divided. The Latinist R. P. H. Green argues that the work was a reaction to the Roman emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]]'s law forbidding Christians from teaching literature that they did not believe to be true (which is to say, classical Greek and Latin mythology).<ref>[[#Green|Green (1995)]], pp. 555{{en dash}}58.</ref><ref name=\"Stevenson 67\">[[#Stevenson|Stevenson (2005)]], p. 67.</ref> Proba's goal, Green writes, was to present Virgil \"without [pagan] gods, and [thus] a [Virgil] no longer vulnerable to Christian criticism\".<ref name=green558>[[#Green|Green (1995)]], p. 558.</ref> In this way, a Christian teacher could use the text to discuss Virgil without compromising their religious and moral integrity.<ref name=green558/> Clark and Hatch, on the other hand, postulate that Jesus's Virgilian nature in the cento may have been Proba's attempt to rebut the unflattering, demonizing descriptions of Jesus in Julian's ''Caesares'' and ''[[Against the Galileans|Contra Galilaeos]]''. They conclude that the hypothesis is intriguing but unverifiable due to the lack of information about Proba, the date of the cento's creation, and her intentions.<ref name=c&h1981-31/><ref name=c&h1981-33/> Finally, the classicist Aurelio Amatucci suggests that Proba composed the cento to teach her children stories from the Bible,<ref>[[#Cullhed|Cullhed (2015)]], pp. 52{{en dash}}53.</ref> although there is no solid evidence that the poem was ever intended to be a teaching tool.<ref name=plant2>[[#Plant|Plant (2004)]], p. 171.</ref><ref name=mcl2008p8/><ref>[[#Cullhed|Cullhed (2015)]], p. 53.</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\nBy studying the manuscript records of [[Cloister|claustral]] libraries, scholars have concluded that Proba's cento was heavily copied upon its release. It was evidently very popular in schools, and often used alongside [[Augustine of Hippo]]'s ''[[De doctrina Christiana]]''; in some instances, Proba's work even eclipsed Augustine's in popularity. According to C\u0103t\u0103lina M\u0103rmureanu, Gianina Cernescu, and Laura Lixandru, the work was likely favored because of its accessible, Virgilian style and because Proba presented herself as  a \"meek\" female, thus appealing to the \"misogynistic views of the general public\".<ref name=mcl2008p8>[[#M\u0103rmureanu|M\u0103rmureanu, Cernescu, and Lixandru (2008)]], p. 8.</ref>\n\n[[File:Francescostjerome.jpg|thumbnail|alt=Painting of Saint Jerome, reading a book|Many scholars believe that [[Jerome]] (''pictured'') criticized the poem.]]\n\nIn the late-4th and early-5th centuries, the work began to receive a more mixed response.

Finally, Shanzer argues that the reference to the war between Magnentius and Constantius in the work's proem precludes the possibility that Faltonia Betitia Proba arranged ''De laudibus Christi'', due to the fact that the war took place in the same year as her supposed death. Shanzer rounds out her hypothesis by also invoking a textual argument, noting that the author of ''De laudibus Christi'' is often referred to in later manuscripts by titles that only Anicia Proba would have received, such as \"mother of the Anicians\" or the \"eminent Roman Mistress\".<ref name=listofreason/>\n\nIn her 2015 book ''Proba the Prophet'', Cullhed counters Shanzer's claims, first by noting that there is no definitive evidence that Faltonia Betitia Proba died in AD 351 and that such an assertion remains speculative at best. Cullhed also argues that \"there are no 'grounds for determining priority{{'\"}} of the poem's opening lines, and that the supposed reference to the AD 387 debate about Easter could have likely referred to an earlier, perhaps less famous dispute.<ref name=listofreason/> As to the titles found in later manuscripts, Cullhed writes that it is likely that they were erroneously inserted during the Middle Ages by scribes who had understandably confused the two Probas. Cullhed also reasons that if Anicia Proba had written ''De laudibus Christi'', the [[Latin literature|Latin poet]] [[Claudian]] would have almost certainly praised her poetic abilities in his AD 395 [[panegyric]] celebrating the joint consulship of her sons [[Anicius Hermogenianus Olybrius]] and [[Anicius Probinus]].<ref name=listofreason/> Cullhed concludes: \"The evidence for discrediting Isidore's attribution [of Faltonia Betitia Proba as the author of the cento] is not sufficient, and so, I will assume that the cento was written in the mid-fourth century by Faltonia Betitia Proba.\"<ref name=listofreason>[[#Cullhed|Cullhed (2015)]], pp. 22{{en dash}}23.</ref> Today, the general consensus among classicists and scholars of Latin is that ''De laudibus Christi'' was indeed written by Faltonia Betitia Proba.<ref name=plant>[[#Plant|Plant (2004)]], p. 170.</ref><ref>[[#Cullhed|Cullhed (2015)]], p. 65.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n*''[[Interpretatio Christiana]]'', the adaptation of non-Christian elements of culture or historical facts to the worldview of Christianity\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{reflist|group=nb}}\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Balmer|first1=Josephine|title=Classical Women Poets|date=1996|publisher=[[Bloodaxe Books]]|place=[[Hexham|Hexham, UK]]|isbn=978-1-85224-342-5|ref=Balmer|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/classicalwomenpo00jose_0}}\n* {{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=[[Cyclop\u00e6dia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences]]|title=Cento|volume=1|page=180|url=http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia01|editor=Chambers, Ephraim|date=1728|publisher=J. and J.
