Kondylis moved to [[Kifisia]], Athens, at the age of six]] Kondylis was awarded the [[Goethe Medal]] in 1991. As a recipient of the [[Humboldt Prize]] he also was in 1994/95 a fellow of the [[Institute for Advanced Study, Berlin|Wissenschaftskolleg]] in Berlin. Kondylis, though, was independent \u2013 a ''Privatgelehrter'' (private scholar) who never aspired to an academic career apart from one attempt in the early 1980s when he entered into discussions with the Philosophy Department of the [[University of Athens]], applying for a placement. His application was confronted with the distrust of the conservative faculty of the philosophical department. Although Kondylis was supported by the then well-known professor Theofilos Veikos, he still had to contend with the opposition of many university-based philosophers and subsequently did not succeed in commencing a career as an academic. Thereafter, he never expressed any wish for an academic career (expressing the view that \"academic philosophy is dead and buried\"),<ref>Letter to Bernd A. Laska of 16 June 1985, in [http://www.lsr-projekt.de/kondylis.html Bernd A. Laska: ''Panajotis Kondylis \u2013 unfreiwilliger Pate des LSR-Projekts'']; \nCf.

His library of some 5000 titles based in his house in [[Politeia, Athens|Politeia]], [[Athens]] was donated by his sister, Melpo Kondylis (\u039c\u03ad\u03bb\u03c0\u03c9 \u039a\u03bf\u03bd\u03b4\u03cd\u03bb\u03b7), to the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]] in which a special \"Kondylis\" section exists in the campus library. In November 2008 a conference was held in Heidelberg honouring the memory of the late Panagiotis Kondylis. A similar event was held in Greece on 22 May 2008.\n\n==Work==\n\nThe great bulk of his corpus was written in German, and most of his writings were translated by Kondylis himself into Greek. He was interested in a number of areas of study including: the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the preceding Renaissance-era critiques of metaphysics; the philosophy of war and [[Clausewitz]], as well as the work of [[Hegel]] and [[Marx]]; Western bourgeois culture and its decline; Conservatism; [[Postmodernity|post-Modernity]], and International Affairs. He also translated into modern Greek classic works by authors such as: [[Xenophon]], [[James Burnham|Burnham]], [[Machiavelli]], [[Marx]], [[Georg Christoph Lichtenberg|Lichtenberg]], [[Cesare Pavese|Pavese]], [[Montesquieu]], [[Nicolas Chamfort|Chamfort]], [[Antoine de Rivarol|Rivarol]], [[Schiller]], [[Ernst Cassirer|Cassirer]] and [[Carl Schmitt]]. Moreover, he was publications manager of the Greek-language \"Philosophical and Political Library\" (editions \u0393\u03bd\u03ce\u03c3\u03b7 (1983\u20131998; 60 volumes)) and \"Modern European Civilisation\" (editions \u039d\u03b5\u03c6\u03ad\u03bb\u03b7 (1997\u20132000; 12 volumes)), producing modern Greek translations of renowned texts by authors as diverse as: [[Hobbes]], [[Lyotard]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], ancient Greek [[Sophists]] and [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]], [[Serge Moscovici|Moscovici]], [[Georges Sorel|Sorel]], [[Heidegger]], [[Jacob Burckhardt|Burckhardt]], [[Robert Michels|Michels]], [[Raymond Aron|Aron]], [[Leo Strauss]], [[Derrida]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[Arnold Hauser (art historian)|Hauser]] et al., and histories of modern Greek philosophy. Kondylis's best known books are: ''Die Aufkl\u00e4rung'' (''The Enlightenment'') and ''Macht und Entscheidung'' (''Power and Decision'') (see below).\n\n===Underlying themes===\n\nKondylis claimed to be \"scientific\" in the sense of writing \"descriptively\" (and explanatorily), in separating ''Is'' (facts) from ''Ought'' (values), rather than writing \"prescriptively\" or \"normatively\". The thread running through all of Kondylis's writings (whether primarily focussed on the history of ideas, social ontology, historical sociology, geopolitics, etc.) is his position that the historical plethora and variety of individual, social and theoretical behaviour or endeavour unfolds against a backdrop of the anthropological law (or constants) of \"power\" and \"decision\". Such \"power\" and \"decision\" continually traverse a friend\u2013foe spectrum within historically formed (and currently dynamic) societies characterised by varying degrees of multi-faceted social relations of individual and collective subjects (in and through which e.g. biological impulses are rationally justified and embellished so that their voice is heard as the command of ethics; the impulse of self-preservation manifests itself as \"meaning of life\"; and sexual urges are dressed up as \"love\"). Orientation, identity formation, hierarchisation, interpretation, the production of normative systems, ideologies, rationality as self-control and the abandonment or postponement of immediate gratification, etc., are all means through which power relations manifest themselves socially and distinguish human civilisations from the basic instinctual behaviour and unrationalised raw violence of the animal kingdom (in short: humans accept \"meaning\" in seeking power, whereas animals do not). As human societies become more complex (and materially wealthier), power and its self-intensification ceases to often coincide with mere physical superiority (as in the case of primitive conditions), and power is often objectivised through greater use of historically determined and relative ((re-)interpreted and often contested) symbols and values. However, raw physical power is always at least potentially available for use by individual and collective subjects who wish to maintain and expand their power. Even scientific knowledge is not beyond historical determination and polemical manipulation \u2013 but only scientific knowledge, if it consistently separates ''Is'' from ''Ought'', can explain in terms of corroboration with empirical reality the abundant variety of human existence and \"knowing\".<ref>Kondylis, P. \"Wissenschaft, Macht und Entscheidung\", in H.

Kondylis's conception of social ontology does not offer any fixed causalities or laws nor does it say what people ought to do or not do in any given situation or how their social action should unfold. The task of social ontology is accordingly not to reduce fluid and varied phenomena to basic samples and basic genetic factors; what is sought is to show the spectrum of the forces and factors, which can only be constituted and become discernible from the \u2013 irreducible and inexhaustible \u2013 diversity of form. Such forces and factors, of course, include certain constants such as striving for self-preservation through the expanding of one's own power, and the friend\u2013foe relation, which exist in all societies and are actualised in concrete historical situations and therefore have concrete dimension and content e.g. when the dominant paradigm might be theocentrism or anthropocentrism or mass democratic post-Modernity. Much of the nearly completed first volume (three volumes had been planned by Kondylis) is an analysis of mass-democratic ideology in the social sciences while also dealing with methodological and theoretical questions such as the distinction between \"socio-ontic observation\" and \"socio-historical observation\" and the three key aspects of the social: the social relation, the political and man. Moreover, Kondylis examines the social relation as regards its \"internal\" mechanism of subjectivity and \"external\" mechanism of action, the friend\u2013foe polarity and the social relation's continuity, in addition to exploring the concepts of understanding and rationality by way of an extensive examination and/or critique of numerous renowned authors such as [[Martin Buber]], [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]], [[Wilhelm Dilthey]], [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Niklas Luhmann]], [[George Herbert Mead]], [[Alfred Sch\u00fctz]], [[Talcott Parsons]], [[Karl Popper]], [[Georg Simmel]], [[Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies]], [[Max Weber]] and [[Leopold von Wiese]].\n\n===The Enlightenment and intellectual history===\n[[Image:Die Aufkl\u00e4rung im Rahmen des neuzeitlichen Rationalismus.jpg|thumb|widthpx|Book cover of ''Die Aufkl\u00e4rung im Rahmen des neuzeitlichen Rationalismus'' (The Enlightenment within the Framework of Modern Rationalism).]]\n\nApart from being a comprehensive survey of the major polemical trends in the European History of Ideas from the end of the Middle Ages and the subsequent turn against [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] [[Rationalism]] by many mainstream and other Enlightenment figures{{Who|date=June 2010}} promoting a \"new\" or revived sensualism, until the post-Kantian period of Schelling and Hegel, ''Die Aufkl\u00e4rung'' (''The Enlightenment''), together with ''Die neuzeitliche Metaphysikkritik'' (''Modern-era Criticism of Metaphysics''), can be seen as analyses of the European Modern Era's struggle against value-relativity and nihilism, which were the logical conclusion of the overall rationalist positioning in the European Modern Era. Against the Aristotelian metaphysics of essence, the notion of function was recruited, and then the danger of breaking-down all essences into variable functions had to be confronted with the invention of new beings: \"Nature\", \"Man\" and \"History\" thus succeeded God and the (transcendental) Spirit. However, the notion of function totally prevailed in the course of the 20th century in the context of overthrowing essence on a global scale (notwithstanding the ongoing and socially inevitable influence of various ideologies and religions); see ''The Decline of Bourgeois Thought- and Life-Forms'' below. Throughout these books, self-preservation and power appear as key concepts in interpreting human affairs, and in setting aside all dualisms and Platonisms, all the traditional distinctions between Hither and Thither, the ideal and reality, understanding and volition. From the point of view of the history of ideas, while the philosophers who did systematically set aside such dualisms were few and far between (e.g. [[Machiavelli]], [[Hobbes]], [[Spinoza]], [[La Mettrie]], [[Marquis de Sade|de Sade]], and to a lesser extent, [[Diderot]], [[Claude Adrien Helv\u00e9tius|Helvetius]], [[Holbach]], [[David Hume|Hume]]), quantitatively, philosophers expounding versions of the traditional distinctions mentioned above, or at least maintained a normative stance necessary to seek social influence, prevailed for much of the European Modern Era, and Kondylis also analysed the basic stance(s) of such and other thinkers including: [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|Alembert]], [[\u00c9tienne Bonnot de Condillac|Condillac]], [[Condorcet]], [[Grotius]], [[Hegel]], [[Johann Georg Hamann|Hamann]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], [[Maupertuis]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], [[Rousseau]], [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Shaftesbury]], [[Voltaire]], and [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)| Wolff]], in considerable detail, as well as referring to other (pre-)Enlightenment thinkers (in addition to those mentioned above) such as: [[Augustine of Hippo| Augustine]], [[Aquinas]], [[Aristotle]], [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], [[Pierre Bayle|Bayle]], [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[Giordano Bruno|Bruno]], [[Descartes]], [[Erasmus]], [[Galileo Galilei|Galilei]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], [[Plato]], [[Pufendorf]], [[Bernardino Telesio|Telesio]], etc. In both ''The Enlightenment'' and ''Modern-era Criticism of Metaphysics'', Kondylis runs a compelling interpretative thread through the constant reformulation of concepts and positioning and apparently overwhelming volume of argumentation, from the late Middle Ages until the 19th century (and 20th century in the case of ''Modern-era Criticism of Metaphysics'', which includes analyses of: [[Bergson]], [[Wilhelm Dilthey|Dilthey]], [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Feuerbach]], [[Heidegger]], [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]], [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]], [[Nietzsche]], [[William of Ockham|Occam]], [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], [[Salutati]], [[Herbert Spencer|Spencer]], [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]], [[Wittgenstein]], and [[Jacopo Zabarella|Zabarella]]), producing scholarly works that not only have a handbook or reference text quality but also an ability to provide insight into the motive forces of development of, and changes in, the history of ideas in the European Modern Era (see also ''Conservatism'' below) before the onset of the new Planetary Era.\n\n===''Power and De-cisio''===\n[[File:Macht und Entscheidung.jpg|thumb|320px|right|The cover for the German edition of ''Power and De-cisio'']]\nIn ''Macht und Entscheidung'' (''Power and De-cisio)<ref>The term De-cisio is provided by the writer in his introduction as the Latin translation of Entscheidung is preferred over Decision since Kondylis is referring to philosophical decisionism, the abstraction and re-arrangement of the external world by the subject in such a way that it appears meaningful to her/him. See \"Introduction\" in Panajotis Kondylis, ''Macht und Entscheidung'', Klett-Cotta, 1981</ref>'' Kondylis set forth the theoretical basis for his attitude to existence and his own endeavours as an author and social scientist. \"Decision\" is here conceptualised differently from its hitherto known varieties in [[decisionism]]; now it appears as a theory about the emergence of individual and collective worldviews. Such an emergence as a function of power i.e. self-preservation through self-enhancement (or self-intensification), always refers to enemy positioning, and as such always contains normative elements within itself. Kondylis examines the claimed bindingness and also ambiguity inherent in all ideologies and social institutions. Drawing from anthropology, philosophy, sociology and history, concepts such as value, value-freedom and nihilism are explored. It is claimed that the infinite variety of human perceptions, beliefs, ideologies, i.e. world-views, are nothing more than an effort to give personal interests a normative form and an objective character, deriving from a \"decision\" on what means should be used, who should be a friend and who a foe, in the big \"Hobbesian\" struggle for what is the most primitive and common goal of all humans \u2013 self-preservation. Therefore, personal and/or group world-views and ideologies in general are used as a weapon in everyday struggle for the purpose of power claims and self-preservation. Social and historical being and becoming consist of transitory existences \u2013 regardless of whether they invoke Reason and ethics or not \u2013 seeking power (in any one or more of its countless forms). That is how Nature's (and society's) creatures are, and they cannot do otherwise.\n\n=== Conservatism ===\n\n[[Image:Kondylis Konservatismus.jpg|thumb|widthpx|Book cover of ''Konservativismus. Geschichtlicher Gehalt und Untergang.'']]\nKondylis's next book, ''Konservativismus. Geschichtlicher Gehalt und Untergang.'' (''Conservatism. Historical Content and Decline.''), like ''The Enlightenment'', which broke new ground in its novel interpretation of such a pivotal period in European philosophy (see above), went against the grain of conventional wisdom on the history of conservatism understood simply as a reaction to the [[French Revolution]] as articulated by e.g. [[Karl Mannheim]]. Rather, in Kondylis's book, conservatism had already existed as a social and political force since the Middle Ages in which the nobility and its estate system, having derived its legitimacy from a particular conception of law as a privilege, combated emerging egalitarian interpretations of law in the European Modern Era, which encompassed the rise of the modern sovereign state, albeit initially in absolutist guises (among which were the attempt to impose religious tolerance and peace in the aftermath of the Reformation and the religious wars). Nevertheless, the book also examines conservatism as a political force adapting to the reality of the modern sovereign state's eventual triumph and in light of the [[French Revolution]] and beyond. Included is an analysis of how the central themes used in the socialist criticism of capitalism were initially formed in the ideological realm of the counter-Revolution, whose social conveyor of this first anti-capitalist criticism was the patriarchal great-landholder, the older or younger aristocrat, who saw his social existence being eroded and falling apart by the irrepressible march of mercantile-monetary relations, the Industrial Revolution and by individualistic-liberal ideas. What followed was an idealised image of pre-capitalist reality, whereby people lived united by the bonds of blood, tradition and mutual faith and protection, from the earth and in nature, preserving their existential essence from the fragmentation which is imposed by the advanced division of labour and the continuous hunt for material gain in a society cut up into competitive individuals. Key intellectuals during conservatism's history include: [[Louis Gabriel Ambroise de Bonald|Bonald]], [[Edmund Burke|Burke]], [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]], [[Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriand|Chateaubriand]], [[Juan Donoso Cort\u00e9s|Cort\u00e9s]], [[Fran\u00e7ois F\u00e9nelon|F\u00e9nelon]], [[Karl Ludwig von Haller|Haller]], [[Karl Ernst Jarcke|Jarcke]], [[Joseph de Maistre|de Maistre]], [[Johann Jakob Moser|Moser]], [[Adam M\u00fcller|M\u00fcller]], [[Radowitz]], [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Schlegel]], and [[Friedrich Julius Stahl|Stahl]].\n\n===''Theory of War''===\n[[Image:Theoria tou polemou.jpg|thumb|widthpx|Book cover of the Greek edition of ''A Theory of War''.]]\n\nIn ''Theorie des Krieges'' (''Theory of War''), Kondylis opposed [[Raymond Aron]]'s liberal interpretation of [[Clausewitz]]'s theory. According to Aron in ''Penser La Guerre'' Clausewitz was one of the first writers condemning the militarism of military elites and their war-proneness (based on the famous sentence \"war is a continuation of politics by other means\"). Kondylis claimed that this was a reconstruction not coherent with Clausewitz's thought. Clausewitz was, according to Kondylis, morally indifferent to war from a theoretical point of view, and his propounding of the value of political rule over war had nothing to do with pacifistic claims. For Clausewitz war was just a means in the eternal quest for power in an often anarchical and unsafe world, and as such war could neither be a continuous phenomenon, nor cease altogether. In other words, war arose from the political (i.e. \"political communication\") in the wider sense of social existence encompassing society as a whole (inclusive of anthropological factors), and whether war occurred at a particular time or not depended on a correlation of social and political forces encompassing collective and individual input into any given state of affairs. Kondylis saw in Clausewitz a general theory of war with sufficiently inclusive and elastic conceptualisation which could cover all forms of strategy \u2013 even antithetical forms: from primitive guerrilla warfare to extremely technicised contemporary war, as well as the possibility of terrorism using advanced technology to cripple modern-day societies. Kondylis continued with an analysis of Lenin's, Engels's and Marx's theories of war, articles about military staff and politicians, technological and absolute war, and concluded (in the Greek edition) with an analysis of a possible Greek\u2013Turkish war.\n\n===''The Decline of the Bourgeois Thought''===\n[[Image:Der Niedergang der b\u00fcrgerlichen Denk und Lebensform.jpg|thumb|widthpx|Book cover of the German edition of ''The Decline of Bourgeois Thought- and Life-Forms.'']]\n\nIn ''Der Niedergang der b\u00fcrgerlichen Denk- und Lebensformen. Die liberale Moderne und die massendemokratische Postmoderne'' (''The Decline of Bourgeois Thought- and Life-Forms. The Liberal Modern and the mass-democratic Post-modern''), Kondylis used Weberian ideal-typical analysis to outline the great \"paradigm shift\" of post-Modernity from around 1900 onwards, in bringing to an end the previously dominant bourgeois-liberal hierarchical and humanist world-view, and ushering in a new era of mass-democratic pluralism and leveling of hierarchies based on mass-democratic social formations characterised by, ''inter alia'', historically unprecedented mass production and mass consumption, atomisation and mobility, and, not least of all, the various forms of mass-democratic ideology. To this end, Kondylis made effective use of his distinction between the \"synthetic-harmonising thought-form\" and the \"analytic-combinatory thought-form\" in which the latter set aside the former during the same period as the setting-aside of classical bourgeois liberalism by mass democracy, which for the most part occurred as the re-interpretation and changing of liberalism in accordance with the needs of mass democracy, and not always as an open and programmatic clash between the two. The \"synthetic-harmonising thought-form\" and the \"analytic-combinatory thought-form\" distinction is applied by Kondylis to his extensive overview of developments in the arts (including literature, music, architecture, the visual arts, cinema), as well as of developments in philosophy, the sciences and commonplace mind-sets and ways of living, mainly from the second half of the 19th century until the cultural revolution of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n===''Planetary Politics after the Cold War''===\n[[Image:Planetary Politics after the Cold War.jpg|thumb|widthpx|Book cover of the German edition of ''Planetary Politics after the Cold War''.]]\nIn ''Planetarische Politik nach dem kalten Krieg'' (''Planetary Politics after the Cold War''), Kondylis dealt with a number of matters e.g. conceptual confusion in the overtly polemical and unhistorical use of \"conservative\", \"liberal\" and \"(social) democracy\"; mass democracy as the world's first international social formation; the impact of communism on the 20th century; and \"human rights\" as predominantly American ideology but also amenable to interpretations contrary to American interests, i.e. the dissemination of universal human rights ideology will lead to a significant increase in international conflict and increase the worldwide trend towards anomy. The end of the Cold War in particular emerges as a pivotal point in history in which the European Modern Era finds itself in its historical twilight while coming full circle, absorbed by the Planetary Era which the European Modern Era itself inaugurated with the great geographic discoveries of the 15th and 16th centuries. Planetary history gulps down its creator, European history \u2013 another one of the blaring examples of the unintended consequences of collective action in history.\n\nKondylis's published works as a whole can be seen as a unified series of analyses based on an unwavering adherence to empirical fact and logical consistency no matter what aspect of study is being emphasised at any given time. He sought to eliminate artificial academic boundaries between e.g. \"philosophy\", \"anthropology\", \"economics\", \"history\", \"sociology\" and \"politics\" by emphasising the interconnectedness of such disciplines from the point of view of \"value-free\" i.e. \"power claim\"-free and non-normative scientific understanding. He thought of himself as \"an observer of human affairs\" or \"writer\" or \"historian of ideas, social historian and theorist\" (always writing by hand), rather than as a \"philosopher\", producing a body of work that bears little resemblance to any other author, apart from perhaps Max Weber.\n\n==Books and articles==\n*''Die Entstehung der Dialektik.''

As a recipient of the [[Humboldt Prize]] he also was in 1994/95 a fellow of the [[Institute for Advanced Study, Berlin|Wissenschaftskolleg]] in Berlin. Kondylis, though, was independent \u2013 a ''Privatgelehrter'' (private scholar) who never aspired to an academic career apart from one attempt in the early 1980s when he entered into discussions with the Philosophy Department of the [[University of Athens]], applying for a placement. His application was confronted with the distrust of the conservative faculty of the philosophical department. Although Kondylis was supported by the then well-known professor Theofilos Veikos, he still had to contend with the opposition of many University based philosophers and subsequently did not succeed in commencing a career as an academic. Thereafter, he never expressed any wish for an academic career (expressing the view that \"academic philosophy is dead and buried\"),<ref>Letter to Bernd A.

His library of some 5000 titles based in his house in [[Politeia, Athens|Politeia]], [[Athens]] was donated by his sister, Melpo Kondylis (\u039c\u03ad\u03bb\u03c0\u03c9 \u039a\u03bf\u03bd\u03b4\u03cd\u03bb\u03b7), to the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]] in which a special \"Kondylis\" section exists in the campus library. In November 2008 a conference was held in Heidelberg honouring the memory of the late Panagiotis Kondylis. A similar event was held in Greece on 22 May 2008.\n\n==Work==\n\nThe great bulk of his corpus was written in German, and most of his writings were translated by Kondylis himself into Greek. He was interested in a number of areas of study including: the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the preceding Renaissance-era critiques of metaphysics; the philosophy of war and [[Clausewitz]], as well as the work of [[Hegel]] and [[Marx]]; Western bourgeois culture and its decline; Conservatism; [[Postmodernity|post-Modernity]], and International Affairs. He also translated into modern Greek classic works by authors such as: [[Xenophon]], [[James Burnham|Burnham]], [[Machiavelli]], [[Marx]], [[Georg Christoph Lichtenberg|Lichtenberg]], [[Cesare Pavese|Pavese]], [[Montesquieu]], [[Nicolas Chamfort|Chamfort]], [[Antoine de Rivarol|Rivarol]], [[Schiller]], [[Ernst Cassirer|Cassirer]] and [[Carl Schmitt]]. Moreover, he was publications manager of the Greek-language \"Philosophical and Political Library\" (editions \u0393\u03bd\u03ce\u03c3\u03b7 (1983\u20131998; 60 volumes)) and \"Modern European Civilisation\" (editions \u039d\u03b5\u03c6\u03ad\u03bb\u03b7 (1997\u20132000; 12 volumes)), producing modern Greek translations of renowned texts by authors as diverse as: [[Hobbes]], [[Lyotard]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], ancient Greek [[Sophists]] and [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]], [[Serge Moscovici|Moscovici]], [[Georges Sorel|Sorel]], [[Heidegger]], [[Jacob Burckhardt|Burckhardt]], [[Robert Michels|Michels]], [[Raymond Aron|Aron]], [[Leo Strauss]], [[Derrida]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[Arnold Hauser (art historian)|Hauser]] et al., and histories of modern Greek philosophy. Kondylis's best known books are: ''Die Aufkl\u00e4rung'' (''The Enlightenment'') and ''Macht und Entscheidung'' (''Power and Decision'') (see below).\n\n===Underlying themes===\n\nKondylis claimed to be \"scientific\" in the sense of writing \"descriptively\" (and explanatorily), in separating ''Is'' (facts) from ''Ought'' (values), rather than writing \"prescriptively\" or \"normatively\". The thread running through all of Kondylis's writings (whether primarily focussed on the history of ideas, social ontology, historical sociology, geopolitics, etc.) is his position that the historical plethora and variety of individual, social and theoretical behaviour or endeavour unfolds against a backdrop of the anthropological law (or constants) of \"power\" and \"decision\". Such \"power\" and \"decision\" continually traverse a friend\u2013foe spectrum within historically formed (and currently dynamic) societies characterised by varying degrees of multi-faceted social relations of individual and collective subjects (in and through which e.g. biological impulses are rationally justified and embellished so that their voice is heard as the command of ethics; the impulse of self-preservation manifests itself as \"meaning of life\"; and sexual urges are dressed up as \"love\"). Orientation, identity formation, hierarchisation, interpretation, the production of normative systems, ideologies, rationality as self-control and the abandonment or postponement of immediate gratification, etc., are all means through which power relations manifest themselves socially and distinguish human civilisations from the basic instinctual behaviour and unrationalised raw violence of the animal kingdom (in short: humans accept \"meaning\" in seeking power, whereas animals do not). As human societies become more complex (and materially wealthier), power and its self-intensification ceases to often coincide with mere physical superiority (as in the case of primitive conditions), and power is often objectivised through greater use of historically determined and relative ((re-)interpreted and often contested) symbols and values. However, raw physical power is always at least potentially available for use by individual and collective subjects who wish to maintain and expand their power. Even scientific knowledge is not beyond historical determination and polemical manipulation \u2013 but only scientific knowledge, if it consistently separates ''Is'' from ''Ought'', can explain in terms of corroboration with empirical reality the abundant variety of human existence and \"knowing\".<ref>Kondylis, P. \"Wissenschaft, Macht und Entscheidung\", in H.

Kondylis's conception of social ontology does not offer any fixed causalities or laws nor does it say what people ought to do or not do in any given situation or how their social action should unfold. The task of social ontology is accordingly not to reduce fluid and varied phenomena to basic samples and basic genetic factors; what is sought is to show the spectrum of the forces and factors, which can only be constituted and become discernible from the \u2013 irreducible and inexhaustible \u2013 diversity of form. Such forces and factors, of course, include certain constants such as striving for self-preservation through the expanding of one's own power, and the friend\u2013foe relation, which exist in all societies and are actualised in concrete historical situations and therefore have concrete dimension and content e.g. when the dominant paradigm might be theocentrism or anthropocentrism or mass democratic post-Modernity. Much of the nearly completed first volume (three volumes had been planned by Kondylis) is an analysis of mass-democratic ideology in the social sciences while also dealing with methodological and theoretical questions such as the distinction between \"socio-ontic observation\" and \"socio-historical observation\" and the three key aspects of the social: the social relation, the political and man. Moreover, Kondylis examines the social relation as regards its \"internal\" mechanism of subjectivity and \"external\" mechanism of action, the friend\u2013foe polarity and the social relation's continuity, in addition to exploring the concepts of understanding and rationality by way of an extensive examination and/or critique of numerous renowned authors such as [[Martin Buber]], [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]], [[Wilhelm Dilthey]], [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Niklas Luhmann]], [[George Herbert Mead]], [[Alfred Sch\u00fctz]], [[Talcott Parsons]], [[Karl Popper]], [[Georg Simmel]], [[Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies]], [[Max Weber]] and [[Leopold von Wiese]].\n\n===The Enlightenment and intellectual history===\n[[Image:Die Aufkl\u00e4rung im Rahmen des neuzeitlichen Rationalismus.jpg|thumb|widthpx|Book cover of ''Die Aufkl\u00e4rung im Rahmen des neuzeitlichen Rationalismus'' (The Enlightenment within the Framework of Modern Rationalism).]]\n\nApart from being a comprehensive survey of the major polemical trends in the European History of Ideas from the end of the Middle Ages and the subsequent turn against [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] [[Rationalism]] by many mainstream and other Enlightenment figures{{Who|date=June 2010}} promoting a \"new\" or revived sensualism, until the post-Kantian period of Schelling and Hegel, ''Die Aufkl\u00e4rung'' (''The Enlightenment''), together with ''Die neuzeitliche Metaphysikkritik'' (''Modern-era Criticism of Metaphysics''), can be seen as analyses of the European Modern Era's struggle against value-relativity and nihilism, which were the logical conclusion of the overall rationalist positioning in the European Modern Era. Against the Aristotelian metaphysics of essence, the notion of function was recruited, and then the danger of breaking-down all essences into variable functions had to be confronted with the invention of new beings: \"Nature\", \"Man\" and \"History\" thus succeeded God and the (transcendental) Spirit. However, the notion of function totally prevailed in the course of the 20th century in the context of overthrowing essence on a global scale (notwithstanding the ongoing and socially inevitable influence of various ideologies and religions); see ''The Decline of Bourgeois Thought- and Life-Forms'' below. Throughout these books, self-preservation and power appear as key concepts in interpreting human affairs, and in setting aside all dualisms and Platonisms, all the traditional distinctions between Hither and Thither, the ideal and reality, understanding and volition. From the point of view of the history of ideas, while the philosophers who did systematically set aside such dualisms were few and far between (e.g. [[Machiavelli]], [[Hobbes]], [[Spinoza]], [[La Mettrie]], [[Marquis de Sade|de Sade]], and to a lesser extent, [[Diderot]], [[Claude Adrien Helv\u00e9tius|Helvetius]], [[Holbach]], [[David Hume|Hume]]), quantitatively, philosophers expounding versions of the traditional distinctions mentioned above, or at least maintained a normative stance necessary to seek social influence, prevailed for much of the European Modern Era, and Kondylis also analysed the basic stance(s) of such and other thinkers including: [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|Alembert]], [[\u00c9tienne Bonnot de Condillac|Condillac]], [[Condorcet]], [[Grotius]], [[Hegel]], [[Johann Georg Hamann|Hamann]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], [[Maupertuis]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], [[Rousseau]], [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Shaftesbury]], [[Voltaire]], and [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)| Wolff]], in considerable detail, as well as referring to other (pre-)Enlightenment thinkers (in addition to those mentioned above) such as: [[Augustine of Hippo| Augustine]], [[Aquinas]], [[Aristotle]], [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], [[Pierre Bayle|Bayle]], [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[Giordano Bruno|Bruno]], [[Descartes]], [[Erasmus]], [[Galileo Galilei|Galilei]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], [[Plato]], [[Pufendorf]], [[Bernardino Telesio|Telesio]], etc. In both ''The Enlightenment'' and ''Modern-era Criticism of Metaphysics'', Kondylis runs a compelling interpretative thread through the constant reformulation of concepts and positioning and apparently overwhelming volume of argumentation, from the late Middle Ages until the 19th century (and 20th century in the case of ''Modern-era Criticism of Metaphysics'', which includes analyses of: [[Bergson]], [[Wilhelm Dilthey|Dilthey]], [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Feuerbach]], [[Heidegger]], [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]], [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]], [[Nietzsche]], [[William of Ockham|Occam]], [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], [[Salutati]], [[Herbert Spencer|Spencer]], [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]], [[Wittgenstein]], and [[Jacopo Zabarella|Zabarella]]), producing scholarly works that not only have a handbook or reference text quality but also an ability to provide insight into the motive forces of development of, and changes in, the history of ideas in the European Modern Era (see also ''Conservatism'' below) before the onset of the new Planetary Era.\n\n===''Power and De-cisio''===\n[[File:Macht und Entscheidung.jpg|thumb|320px|right|The cover for the German edition of ''Power and De-cisio'']]\nIn ''Macht und Entscheidung'' (''Power and De-cisio)<ref>The term De-cisio is provided by the writer in his introduction as the Latin translation of Entscheidung is preferred over Decision since Kondylis is referring to philosophical decisionism, the abstraction and re-arrangement of the external world by the subject in such a way that it appears meaningful to her/him. See \"Introduction\" in Panajotis Kondylis, ''Macht und Entscheidung'', Klett-Cotta, 1981</ref>'' Kondylis set forth the theoretical basis for his attitude to existence and his own endeavours as an author and social scientist. \"Decision\" is here conceptualised differently from its hitherto known varieties in [[decisionism]]; now it appears as a theory about the emergence of individual and collective worldviews. Such an emergence as a function of power i.e. self-preservation through self-enhancement (or self-intensification), always refers to enemy positioning, and as such always contains normative elements within itself. Kondylis examines the claimed bindingness and also ambiguity inherent in all ideologies and social institutions. Drawing from anthropology, philosophy, sociology and history, concepts such as value, value-freedom and nihilism are explored. It is claimed that the infinite variety of human perceptions, beliefs, ideologies, i.e. world-views, are nothing more than an effort to give personal interests a normative form and an objective character, deriving from a \"decision\" on what means should be used, who should be a friend and who a foe, in the big \"Hobbesian\" struggle for what is the most primitive and common goal of all humans \u2013 self-preservation. Therefore, personal and/or group world-views and ideologies in general are used as a weapon in everyday struggle for the purpose of power claims and self-preservation. Social and historical being and becoming consist of transitory existences \u2013 regardless of whether they invoke Reason and ethics or not \u2013 seeking power (in any one or more of its countless forms). That is how Nature's (and society's) creatures are, and they cannot do otherwise.\n\n=== Conservatism ===\n\n[[Image:Kondylis Konservatismus.jpg|thumb|widthpx|Book cover of ''Konservativismus. Geschichtlicher Gehalt und Untergang.'']]\nKondylis's next book, ''Konservativismus. Geschichtlicher Gehalt und Untergang.'' (''Conservatism. Historical Content and Decline.''), like ''The Enlightenment'', which broke new ground in its novel interpretation of such a pivotal period in European philosophy (see above), went against the grain of conventional wisdom on the history of conservatism understood simply as a reaction to the [[French Revolution]] as articulated by e.g. [[Karl Mannheim]]. Rather, in Kondylis's book, conservatism had already existed as a social and political force since the Middle Ages in which the nobility and its estate system, having derived its legitimacy from a particular conception of law as a privilege, combated emerging egalitarian interpretations of law in the European Modern Era, which encompassed the rise of the modern sovereign state, albeit initially in absolutist guises (among which were the attempt to impose religious tolerance and peace in the aftermath of the Reformation and the religious wars). Nevertheless, the book also examines conservatism as a political force adapting to the reality of the modern sovereign state's eventual triumph and in light of the [[French Revolution]] and beyond. Included is an analysis of how the central themes used in the socialist criticism of capitalism were initially formed in the ideological realm of the counter-Revolution, whose social conveyor of this first anti-capitalist criticism was the patriarchal great-landholder, the older or younger aristocrat, who saw his social existence being eroded and falling apart by the irrepressible march of mercantile-monetary relations, the Industrial Revolution and by individualistic-liberal ideas. What followed was an idealised image of pre-capitalist reality, whereby people lived united by the bonds of blood, tradition and mutual faith and protection, from the earth and in nature, preserving their existential essence from the fragmentation which is imposed by the advanced division of labour and the continuous hunt for material gain in a society cut up into competitive individuals. Key intellectuals during conservatism's history include: [[Louis Gabriel Ambroise de Bonald|Bonald]], [[Edmund Burke|Burke]], [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]], [[Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriand|Chateaubriand]], [[Juan Donoso Cort\u00e9s|Cort\u00e9s]], [[Fran\u00e7ois F\u00e9nelon|F\u00e9nelon]], [[Karl Ludwig von Haller|Haller]], [[Karl Ernst Jarcke|Jarcke]], [[Joseph de Maistre|de Maistre]], [[Johann Jakob Moser|Moser]], [[Adam M\u00fcller|M\u00fcller]], [[Radowitz]], [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Schlegel]], and [[Friedrich Julius Stahl|Stahl]].\n\n===''Theory of War''===\n[[Image:Theoria tou polemou.jpg|thumb|widthpx|Book cover of the Greek edition of ''A Theory of War''.]]\n\nIn ''Theorie des Krieges'' (''Theory of War''), Kondylis opposed [[Raymond Aron]]'s liberal interpretation of [[Clausewitz]]'s theory. According to Aron in ''Penser La Guerre'' Clausewitz was one of the first writers condemning the militarism of military elites and their war-proneness (based on the famous sentence \"war is a continuation of politics by other means\"). Kondylis claimed that this was a reconstruction not coherent with Clausewitz's thought. Clausewitz was, according to Kondylis, morally indifferent to war from a theoretical point of view, and his propounding of the value of political rule over war had nothing to do with pacifistic claims. For Clausewitz war was just a means in the eternal quest for power in an often anarchical and unsafe world, and as such war could neither be a continuous phenomenon, nor cease altogether. In other words, war arose from the political (i.e. \"political communication\") in the wider sense of social existence encompassing society as a whole (inclusive of anthropological factors), and whether war occurred at a particular time or not depended on a correlation of social and political forces encompassing collective and individual input into any given state of affairs. Kondylis saw in Clausewitz a general theory of war with sufficiently inclusive and elastic conceptualisation which could cover all forms of strategy \u2013 even antithetical forms: from primitive guerrilla warfare to extremely technicised contemporary war, as well as the possibility of terrorism using advanced technology to cripple modern-day societies. Kondylis continued with an analysis of Lenin's, Engels's and Marx's theories of war, articles about military staff and politicians, technological and absolute war, and concluded (in the Greek edition) with an analysis of a possible Greek\u2013Turkish war.\n\n===''The Decline of the Bourgeois Thought''===\n[[Image:Der Niedergang der b\u00fcrgerlichen Denk und Lebensform.jpg|thumb|widthpx|Book cover of the German edition of ''The Decline of Bourgeois Thought- and Life-Forms.'']]\n\nIn ''Der Niedergang der b\u00fcrgerlichen Denk- und Lebensformen. Die liberale Moderne und die massendemokratische Postmoderne'' (''The Decline of Bourgeois Thought- and Life-Forms. The Liberal Modern and the mass-democratic Post-modern''), Kondylis used Weberian ideal-typical analysis to outline the great \"paradigm shift\" of post-Modernity from around 1900 onwards, in bringing to an end the previously dominant bourgeois-liberal hierarchical and humanist world-view, and ushering in a new era of mass-democratic pluralism and leveling of hierarchies based on mass-democratic social formations characterised by, ''inter alia'', historically unprecedented mass production and mass consumption, atomisation and mobility, and, not least of all, the various forms of mass-democratic ideology. To this end, Kondylis made effective use of his distinction between the \"synthetic-harmonising thought-form\" and the \"analytic-combinatory thought-form\" in which the latter set aside the former during the same period as the setting-aside of classical bourgeois liberalism by mass democracy, which for the most part occurred as the re-interpretation and changing of liberalism in accordance with the needs of mass democracy, and not always as an open and programmatic clash between the two. The \"synthetic-harmonising thought-form\" and the \"analytic-combinatory thought-form\" distinction is applied by Kondylis to his extensive overview of developments in the arts (including literature, music, architecture, the visual arts, cinema), as well as of developments in philosophy, the sciences and commonplace mind-sets and ways of living, mainly from the second half of the 19th century until the cultural revolution of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n===''Planetary Politics after the Cold War''===\n[[Image:Planetary Politics after the Cold War.jpg|thumb|widthpx|Book cover of the German edition of ''Planetary Politics after the Cold War''.]]\nIn ''Planetarische Politik nach dem kalten Krieg'' (''Planetary Politics after the Cold War''), Kondylis dealt with a number of matters e.g. conceptual confusion in the overtly polemical and unhistorical use of \"conservative\", \"liberal\" and \"(social) democracy\"; mass democracy as the world's first international social formation; the impact of communism on the 20th century; and \"human rights\" as predominantly American ideology but also amenable to interpretations contrary to American interests, i.e. the dissemination of universal human rights ideology will lead to a significant increase in international conflict and increase the worldwide trend towards anomy. The end of the Cold War in particular emerges as a pivotal point in history in which the European Modern Era finds itself in its historical twilight while coming full circle, absorbed by the Planetary Era which the European Modern Era itself inaugurated with the great geographic discoveries of the 15th and 16th centuries. Planetary history gulps down its creator, European history \u2013 another one of the blaring examples of the unintended consequences of collective action in history.\n\nKondylis's published works as a whole can be seen as a unified series of analyses based on an unwavering adherence to empirical fact and logical consistency no matter what aspect of study is being emphasised at any given time. He sought to eliminate artificial academic boundaries between e.g. \"philosophy\", \"anthropology\", \"economics\", \"history\", \"sociology\" and \"politics\" by emphasising the interconnectedness of such disciplines from the point of view of \"value-free\" i.e. \"power claim\"-free and non-normative scientific understanding. He thought of himself as \"an observer of human affairs\" or \"writer\" or \"historian of ideas, social historian and theorist\" (always writing by hand), rather than as a \"philosopher\", producing a body of work that bears little resemblance to any other author, apart from perhaps Max Weber.\n\n==Books and articles==\n*''Die Entstehung der Dialektik.''

Much like the content of the film, Horner's music was a direct continuation of the score he wrote for the previous film. When writing music for ''The Wrath of Khan'', Horner was aware he would reuse certain cues for an impending sequel; two major themes he reworked were for Genesis and Spock. While the Genesis theme supplants the title music Horner wrote for ''The Wrath of Khan'', the end credits were quoted \"almost verbatim\".<ref name=\"cinemascore-simak\">Simak.</ref>\n\nIn hours-long discussions with Bennett and Nimoy, Horner agreed with the director that the \"romantic and more sensitive\" cues were more important than the \"bombastic\" ones.<ref name=\"cinemascore-simak\"/> Horner had written Spock's theme to give the character more dimension: \"By putting a theme over Spock, it warms him and he becomes three-dimensional rather than a collection of schticks,\" he said.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Anderson, Kay|year=1982|title='Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan': How the TV series became a hit movie, at last|journal=[[Cinefantastique]]|volume=12|issue=5\u20136|pages=72|issn=0145-6032}}</ref> The theme was expanded  in ''The Search for Spock'' to represent the ancient alien mysticism and culture of Spock and Vulcan.<ref name=\"cinemascore-simak\"/>\n\nAmong the new cues Horner wrote was a \"percussive and atonal\" theme for the Klingons which is represented heavily in the film.<ref name=\"cinemascore-simak\"/> [[Jeff Bond]] described the cue as a compromise between music from Horner's earlier film ''[[Wolfen (film)|Wolfen]]'', Khan's motif from ''The Wrath of Khan'', and [[Jerry Goldsmith]]'s Klingon music from ''The Motion Picture''.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|113}} Horner also adapted music from [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)|Romeo and Juliet]]'' for part of the ''Enterprise'' theft sequence and its destruction, while the scoring to Spock's resurrection on Vulcan draws similarities to Horner's ''[[Brainstorm (1983 film)|Brainstorm]]'' ending.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|114}}\n\n====''Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home'' (1986)====\n[[James Horner]], composer for ''The Wrath of Khan'' and ''The Search for Spock'', declined to return for ''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home|The Voyage Home]]''. Because of this Nimoy turned to his friend [[Leonard Rosenman]], who had written the music to, among other films, ''[[Fantastic Voyage]]'', [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', and three ''[[Planet of the Apes]]'' sequels.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|119}}<ref name=\"breyer\">Breyer.</ref> Rosenman wrote an arrangement of [[Alexander Courage]]'s ''Star Trek'' television theme as the title music for ''The Voyage Home'', but Nimoy suggested that he write his own instead. As music critic [[Jeff Bond]] writes, \"The final result was one of the most unusual ''Star Trek'' movie themes,\" consisting of a six note theme and variations set against a repetitious four note brass motif; the theme's bridge is reminiscent of material in Rosenman's \"Frodo March\" for ''The Lord of the Rings''.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|119}} The melody makes appearances in the beginning of the film at Vulcan as well as when Taylor seeks Kirk's help finding her whales.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|120}}\n\nThe Earth-based setting of the filming gave Rosenman leeway to write a variety of music in different styles. Nimoy intended the crew's introduction to the streets of San Francisco to be accompanied by something reminiscent of [[George Gershwin]], but Rosenman changed the director's mind<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|131}} and the scene was scored with a contemporary [[jazz fusion]] piece by [[Yellowjackets]]. When Chekov flees detention aboard the aircraft carrier, Rosenman wrote a bright cue that incorporated classical Russian compositions, while the escape from the hospital was done in a baroque style. More familiar Rosenman compositions included the action music as the Bird of Prey and a whaling ship face off in open water, while the whale's communication with the probe used atmospheric music reminiscent of the composer's work in ''Fantastic Voyage''. After the probe leaves, the music turns into a [[Vivaldi]]esque \"whale fugue\". The first sighting of the ''Enterprise''-A uses the Alexander Courage theme before the end title music.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|120}}\n\n[[Mark Mangini]] served as ''The Voyage Home''{{'}}s sound designer. He described it as different from working on many other films because Nimoy appreciated the role of sound effects and made sure that they were prominent in the film. Since many sounds familiar to ''Star Trek'' had already been established\u2014the Bird of Prey's cloaking device, the transporter beam, et al.\u2014Mangini focused on making only small changes to them. The most important sounds were those created by the whales and the probe. Mangini's brother lived close to [[Roger Payne]], a biologist who had many recordings of whale song. Mangini went through the tapes and chose sounds that could be mixed to suggest a sort of language and conversation. The probe's screeching calls were the whale song in distorted form. The humpback's communication with the probe at the climax of the film contained no dramatic music, meaning that Mangini's sounds had to stand alone. He recalled that he had some difficulty with envisioning how the scene would unfold, leading Bennett to perform a [[puppet show]] to explain. Nimoy and the other producers were unhappy with Mangini's attempts to create the probe's droning operating noise; after 18 attempts, the [[sound designer]] finally asked Nimoy what he thought the probe should sound like, and recorded Nimoy's response. Nimoy's voice was distorted with \"just the tiniest bit of dressing\" and used as the final sound.<ref name=\"special features-abovetheline\">Special features, \"Below-the-Line: Sound Design\".</ref>\n\nThe punk music that blares during the bus scene was written by Thatcher after he learned that the audio to be added to the scene would be \"[[Duran Duran]], or whoever\" and not \"raw\" and authentic punk.<ref name=\"ign-kirk thatcher\">{{cite web|author=Plume, Kenneth|date=2000-02-10|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/035/035854p1.html|title=Interview with Kirk Thatcher (Part 1 of 2)|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2009-12-08}}</ref> Thatcher collaborated with Mangini and two [[Audio engineer|sound editors]] (who were in punk bands) to create their own music. They decided that punk distilled down to the sentiment of \"I hate you\", and wrote a sound to match. Recording in the sound studio as originally planned produced too clean a sound, so they moved to the outside hallway and recorded the entire band in one take using cheap microphones to create the distorted sound intended.<ref name=\"special features-onlocation\">Special features: \"On Location\".</ref> The song was later used for Paramount's \"[[Back to the Beach]]\".<ref name=\"ign-kirk thatcher\"/>\n\n====''Star Trek V: The Final Frontier'' (1989)====\nMusic critic [[Jeff Bond]] wrote that Shatner made \"at least two wise decisions\" in making ''[[Star Trek V: The Final Frontier|The Final Frontier]]''; he chose [[Laurence Luckinbill]] to play the role of Sybok, and he hired [[Jerry Goldsmith]] to compose the film's score. Goldsmith had written the Academy Award-nominated score for ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'', and the new ''Trek'' film was an opportunity to craft music with a similar level of ambition while adding action and character\u2014two elements largely missing from ''The Motion Picture''.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|133}}\n\nGoldsmith's main theme begins with the traditional opening notes from [[Alexander Courage]]'s original television series theme; an ascending string and electronic bridge leads to a rendition of the march from ''The Motion Picture''. According to Jeff Bond, Goldsmith's use of ''The Motion Picture''{{'}}s march led to some confusion among ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' fans, as they were unfamiliar with the music's origins and believed that Goldsmith was stealing the theme to ''The Next Generation'', which was itself ''The Motion Picture'' march.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|133}} Another theme from ''The Motion Picture'' that makes a return appearance is the Klingon theme from the 1979 film's opening scene. Here, the theme is treated in what Bond termed a \"Prokofiev-like style as opposed to the avant-garde counterpoint\" as seen in ''The Motion Picture''. Goldsmith also added a crying ram's horn.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|134}}\n\nThe breadth of ''The Final Frontier''{{'}}s locations led Goldsmith to eschew the two-themed approach of ''The Motion Picture'' in favor of [[leitmotif]]s, recurring music used for locations and characters. Sybok is introduced with a synthesized motif in the opening scene of the film, while when Kirk and Spock discuss him en route to Nimbus III it is rendered in a more mysterious fashion. The motif also appears in the action cue as Kirk and company land on Nimbus III and try to free the hostages.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|133}} When Sybok boards the ''Enterprise'', a new four-note motif played by low brass highlights the character's obsession. The Sybok theme from then on is used in either a benevolent sense or a more percussive, dark rendition. Arriving at Sha-ka-ree, the planet's five-note theme bears resemblance to Goldsmith's unicorn theme from ''Legend''; \"...the two melodies represent very similar ideas: lost innocence and the tragic impossibility of recapturing paradise,\" writes Bond. The music features cellos conveying a pious quality, while the appearance of \"God\" begins with string glissandos but turns to a dark rendition of Sybok's theme as its true nature is exposed.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|134}} As the creature attacks Kirk, Spock and McCoy, the more aggressive Sybok theme takes on an attacking rhythm. When Spock appeals to the Klingons for help, the theme takes on a sensitive character before returning to a powerful sequence as the ship destroys the god-creature.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|135}}\n\n====''Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country'' (1991)====\nDirector Nicholas Meyer's original plan for the score of ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country|The Undiscovered Country]]'' was to adapt [[Gustav Holst]]'s orchestral suite ''[[The Planets]]''. The plan proved unfeasibly expensive, so Meyer began listening to demo tapes submitted by composers.<ref name=\"linernotes-meyer1\">{{cite AV media notes |title=Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country Original Motion Picture Soundtrack |titlelink=|year=1991 |chapter=Director's notes |url= |first=Nicholas |last= Meyer|authorlink= Nicholas Meyer|pages= 2\u20133|type= |publisher=Famous Music Corporation |id= |location= }}</ref> Meyer described most of the demos as generic \"movie music\", but was intrigued by one tape by a young composer named [[Cliff Eidelman]]. Eidelman, then 26, had made a career in composing for ballets, television, and film, but despite work on fourteen features, no film had been the hit needed to propel Eidelman to greater fame.<ref>Schweiger, 8.</ref>\n\nIn conversations with Eidelman, Meyer mentioned that since the marches that accompanied the main titles for other ''Star Trek'' films were so good, he had no desire to compete with them by composing a bombastic opening. He also felt that since the film was darker than its predecessors, it demanded something different musically as a result. He mentioned the opening to [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Firebird]]'' as similar to the foreboding sound he wanted. Two days later Eidelman produced a tape of his idea for the main theme, played on a synthesizer. Meyer was impressed by the speed of the work and the close fit to his vision.<ref name=\"linernotes-meyer1\"/> Meyer approached producer Steven Charles-Jaffe with Eidelman's CD, which reminded Jaffe of [[Bernard Herrmann]]; Eidelman was given the task of composing the score.<ref name=\"special features-stories\">Special Features, \"Six Stories from Star Trek VI\".</ref>\n\nEidelman's previous project had been creating a compilation of music from the past five ''Star Trek'' films, and he consciously avoided taking inspiration from those scores. \"[The compilation] showed me what to stay away from, because I couldn't do [[James Horner]] [composer for ''The Wrath of Khan'' and ''The Search for Spock''] as well as James Horner,\" he said.<ref name=\"schweiger-9\">Schweiger, 9.</ref> Since he was hired early on in production, Eidelman had an unusually long time to develop his ideas, and he was able to visit the sets during filming. While the film was in early production Eidelman worked on electronic drafts of the final score, to placate executives who were unsure about using a relatively unknown composer.<ref name=\"schweiger-9\" />\n\nEidelman stated that he finds science fiction the most interesting and exciting genre to compose for, and that Meyer told him to treat the film as a fresh start, rather than drawing on old ''Star Trek'' themes.<ref name=\"special features-stories\"/> Eidelman wanted the music to aid the visuals; for Rura Penthe, he strove to create an atmosphere that reflected the alien and dangerous setting, introducing exotic instruments for color. Besides using percussion from around the world, Eidelman treated the choir as percussion, with the Klingon language translation for \"[[to be, or not to be]]\" (\"''taH pagh, taHbe''\") being repeated in the background. Spock's theme was designed to be an ethereal counterpart to the motif for Kirk and the ''Enterprise'', aimed at capturing \"the emotional gleam in the captain's eye\".<ref name=\"schweiger-10\">Schweiger, 10.</ref> Kirk's internal dilemma about what the future holds was echoed in the main theme: \"It's Kirk taking control one last time and as he looks out into the stars he has the spark again [...] But there's an unresolved note, because it's very important that he doesn't trust the Klingons. He doesn't want to go on this trip even though the spark is there that overtook him.\"<ref name=\"altman-46\">Altman, 46.</ref> For the climactic battle, Eidelman starts the music quietly, building the intensity as the battle progresses.<ref name=\"special features-stories\" />\n\n===''The Next Generation''===\n\n====''Star Trek Generations'' (1994)====\n[[Dennis McCarthy (composer)|Dennis McCarthy]], a composer who had worked on ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|The Next Generation]]'', was given the task of composing for ''[[Star Trek Generations]]''. Critic [[Jeff Bond]] wrote that while McCarthy's score was \"tasked with straddling the styles of both series\", it also offered the opportunity for the composer to produce stronger dramatic writing. His opening music was an ethereal choral piece that plays while a floating champagne bottle tumbles through space. For the action scenes with the ''Enterprise''-B, McCarthy used low brass chords and touches. Kirk was given a brass motif accented by snare drums (a touch verboten during ''The Next Generation''), while the scene ends with a dissonant notes as Scott and Chekov discover Kirk has been blown into space.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|152}}\n\nMcCarthy expanded his brassy style for the film's action sequences, such as the battle over Veridian III and the crash-landing of the ''Enterprise''. For Picard's trip to the Nexus, more choral music and synthesizers accompany Picard's discovery of his family. The film's only distinct theme, a broad fanfare, first plays when Picard and Kirk meet. The theme blends McCarthy's theme for Picard from ''The Next Generation''{{'}}s first season, notes from the theme for ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', and [[Alexander Courage]]'s classic ''Star Trek'' fanfare.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|152}}\n\n====''Star Trek: First Contact'' (1996)====\nFilm composer [[Jerry Goldsmith]] scored ''[[Star Trek: First Contact|First Contact]]'', his third ''Star Trek'' feature. Goldsmith wrote a sweeping main title which begins with [[Alexander Courage]]'s classic [[Theme from Star Trek|''Star Trek'' fanfare]].<ref name=\"norman\"/> Instead of composing a menacing theme to underscore the Borg, Goldsmith wrote a pastoral theme linked to humanity's hopeful first contact. The theme uses a four-note motif used in Goldsmith's ''[[Star Trek V: The Final Frontier]]'' score, which is used in ''First Contact'' as a friendship theme and general thematic link.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|155\u2013156}} A menacing march with touches of synthesizers was used to represent the Borg. In addition to composing new music, Goldsmith used music from his previous ''Star Trek'' scores, including his theme from ''The Motion Picture''.<ref name=\"norman\">Norman.</ref> The Klingon theme from the same film is used to represent Worf.<ref name=\"larson\"/>\n\nBecause of delays with Paramount's ''[[The Ghost and the Darkness]]'', the already-short four week production schedule was cut to just three weeks. While Berman was concerned about the move,<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|158}} Goldsmith hired his son, [[Joel Goldsmith|Joel]], to assist.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|155}} The young composer provided additional music for the film, writing three cues based on his father's motifs<ref name=\"larson\">Larson.</ref> and a total of 22&nbsp;minutes of music.<ref name=\"norman\"/>  Joel used variations of his father's Borg music and the Klingon theme as Worf fights hand-to-hand<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|156}} (Joel said that he and his father decided to use the theme for Worf separately).<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|159}} When the Borg invade sickbay and the medical hologram distracts them, Joel wrote what critic [[Jeff Bond]] termed \"almost [[Aaron Copland|Coplandesque]]\" material of tuning strings and clarinet, but the cue was unused. While Joel composed many of the film's action cues, his father contributed to the spacewalk and ''Phoenix'' flight sequences. During the fight on the deflector dish, Goldsmith used low-register electronics punctuated by stabs of violent, dissonant strings.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|156}}\n\nIn a break with ''Star Trek'' film tradition, the soundtrack incorporated two licensed songs: [[Roy Orbison]]'s \"Ooby Dooby\" and [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]]'s \"Magic Carpet Ride\". [[GNP Crescendo Record Co.|GNP Crescendo]] president Neil Norman explained that the decision to include the tracks was controversial, but said that \"Frakes did the most amazing job of integrating those songs into the story that we had to use them\".<ref name=\"billboard-sprague nothing like the reel thing\"/>\n\nGNP released the ''First Contact'' soundtrack on December 2, 1996.<ref name=\"billboard-sprague nothing like the reel thing\">{{cite news|author=Sprague, David|date=1996-12-14|title=Nothing like the reel thing; Soundtrack and film score news|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref> The album contained 51&nbsp;minutes of music, with 35&nbsp;minutes of Jerry Goldsmith's score, 10&nbsp;minutes of additional music by Joel Goldsmith, \"Ooby Dooby\" and \"Magic Carpet Ride\".

''Insurrection'' opens with [[Alexander Courage]]'s ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' fanfare, also introducing a six-note motif used in many of the film's action sequences. The Ba'ku are scored with a pastoral theme, repeating harps, string sections and a woodwind solo. The Ba'ku's ability to slow time uses a variation of this music.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|164}}\n\nGoldsmith approached starship sequences with quick bursts of brass music. While observers are watching the Ba'ku unseen, Goldsmith employed a \"spying theme\". Composed of a piano, timpani percussion, and brass, the theme builds until interrupted by the action theme as Data opens fire. Goldsmith did not write a motif for the Son'a, choosing to score the action sequence without designating the Son'a as an antagonist (suggesting the film's revelation that the Son'a and Ba'ku are related.) The film's climax is scored with the action material, balanced by \"sense of wonder\" music similar to cues from ''The Motion Picture''.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|164}}\n\n====''Star Trek: Nemesis'' (2002)====\n{{Main|Star Trek: Nemesis (soundtrack)}}\n\nThe music to ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis|Nemesis]]'' was the final ''Star Trek'' score and penultimate film score composed and conducted by [[Jerry Goldsmith]] before his death in 2004 (not including his music for the 2003 film ''[[Timeline (2003 film)|Timeline]]'', which was rejected due to a complicated post-production process).  The score opens with [[Alexander Courage]]'s ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' fanfare, but quickly transitions into a much darker theme to accompany the conflict between the Reman and Romulan empires.  Goldsmith also composed a new 5-note theme to accompany the character [[Shinzon]] and the ''Scimitar'', which is manipulated throughout the score to reflect the multiple dimensions of the character.  Goldsmith also incorporated a number of zipping, swooshing synthesizers into the conventional orchestra to illustrate the suspenseful and horrific elements of the story.  The score is book-ended with Goldsmith's theme from ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'', following a brief excerpt from the popular 1929 song \"[[Blue Skies (1926 song)|Blue Skies]]\" by [[Irving Berlin]].<ref>Clemmensen, Christian.

Instead Horner adapted the opening fanfare of [[Alexander Courage]]'s ''Star Trek'' television theme. \"The fanfare draws you in immediately\u2014you know you're going to get a good movie,\" Horner said.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|9}}\n\nIn comparison to the flowing main theme, Khan's [[leitmotif]] was designed as a percussive texture that could be overlaid with other music and emphasized the character's insanity.<ref name=\"anderson-72\"/> The seven-note brass theme was [[echoplex]]ed to emphasize the character's ruminations about the past while on Ceti Alpha V, but does not play fully until ''Reliant''{{'}}s attack on the ''Enterprise''. Many elements drew from Horner's previous work (a rhythm that accompanies Khan's theme during the surprise attack borrows from an attack theme from ''Wolfen'', in turn influenced by Goldsmith's score for ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]''. Musical moments from the original television series are also heard during investigation of the Regula space station and elsewhere.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|106\u2013107}}\n\nTo Horner, the \"stuff underneath\" the main story was what needed to be addressed by the score; in ''The Wrath of Khan'', this was the relationship between Kirk and Spock. The main theme serves as Kirk's theme, with a mellower section following that is the theme for the Starship ''Enterprise''.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|8}} Horner also wrote a motif for Spock, to emphasize the character's depth: \"By putting a theme over Spock, it warms him and he becomes three-dimensional rather than a collection of schticks.\"<ref name=\"anderson-72\">Anderson, 72.</ref> The difference in the short, French horn-based cues for the villain and longer melodies for the heroes helped to differentiate characters and ships during the battle sequences.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|9}}\n\nThe soundtrack was Horner's first major film score,<ref name=\"post-music\"/> and was written in four and a half weeks.

Much like the content of the film, Horner's music was a direct continuation of the score he wrote for the previous film. When writing music for ''The Wrath of Khan'', Horner was aware he would reuse certain cues for an impending sequel; two major themes he reworked were for Genesis and Spock. While the Genesis theme supplants the title music Horner wrote for ''The Wrath of Khan'', the end credits were quoted \"almost verbatim\".<ref name=\"cinemascore-simak\">Simak.</ref>\n\nIn hours-long discussions with Bennett and Nimoy, Horner agreed with the director that the \"romantic and more sensitive\" cues were more important than the \"bombastic\" ones.<ref name=\"cinemascore-simak\"/> Horner had written Spock's theme to give the character more dimension: \"By putting a theme over Spock, it warms him and he becomes three-dimensional rather than a collection of schticks,\" he said.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Anderson, Kay|year=1982|title='Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan': How the TV series became a hit movie, at last|journal=[[Cinefantastique]]|volume=12|issue=5\u20136|pages=72|issn=0145-6032}}</ref> The theme was expanded  in ''The Search for Spock'' to represent the ancient alien mysticism and culture of Spock and Vulcan.<ref name=\"cinemascore-simak\"/>\n\nAmong the new cues Horner wrote was a \"percussive and atonal\" theme for the Klingons which is represented heavily in the film.<ref name=\"cinemascore-simak\"/> [[Jeff Bond]] described the cue as a compromise between music from Horner's earlier film ''[[Wolfen (film)|Wolfen]]'', Khan's motif from ''The Wrath of Khan'', and [[Jerry Goldsmith]]'s Klingon music from ''The Motion Picture''.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|113}} Horner also adapted music from [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)|Romeo and Juliet]]'' for part of the ''Enterprise'' theft sequence and its destruction, while the scoring to Spock's resurrection on Vulcan draws similarities to Horner's ''[[Brainstorm (1983 film)|Brainstorm]]'' ending.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|114}}\n\n====''Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home'' (1986)====\n[[James Horner]], composer for ''The Wrath of Khan'' and ''The Search for Spock'', declined to return for ''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home|The Voyage Home]]''. Because of this Nimoy turned to his friend [[Leonard Rosenman]], who had written the music to, among other films, ''[[Fantastic Voyage]]'', [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', and three ''[[Planet of the Apes]]'' sequels.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|119}}<ref name=\"breyer\">Breyer.</ref> Rosenman wrote an arrangement of [[Alexander Courage]]'s ''Star Trek'' television theme as the title music for ''The Voyage Home'', but Nimoy suggested that he write his own instead. As music critic [[Jeff Bond]] writes, \"The final result was one of the most unusual ''Star Trek'' movie themes,\" consisting of a six note theme and variations set against a repetitious four note brass motif; the theme's bridge is reminiscent of material in Rosenman's \"Frodo March\" for ''The Lord of the Rings''.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|119}} The melody makes appearances in the beginning of the film at Vulcan as well as when Taylor seeks Kirk's help finding her whales.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|120}}\n\nThe Earth-based setting of the filming gave Rosenman leeway to write a variety of music in different styles. Nimoy intended the crew's introduction to the streets of San Francisco to be accompanied by something reminiscent of [[George Gershwin]], but Rosenman changed the director's mind<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|131}} and the scene was scored with a contemporary [[jazz fusion]] piece by [[Yellowjackets]]. When Chekov flees detention aboard the aircraft carrier, Rosenman wrote a bright cue that incorporated classical Russian compositions, while the escape from the hospital was done in a baroque style. More familiar Rosenman compositions included the action music as the Bird of Prey and a whaling ship face off in open water, while the whale's communication with the probe used atmospheric music reminiscent of the composer's work in ''Fantastic Voyage''. After the probe leaves, the music turns into a [[Vivaldi]]esque \"whale fugue\". The first sighting of the ''Enterprise''-A uses the Alexander Courage theme before the end title music.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|120}}\n\n[[Mark Mangini]] served as ''The Voyage Home''{{'}}s sound designer. He described it as different from working on many other films because Nimoy appreciated the role of sound effects and made sure that they were prominent in the film. Since many sounds familiar to ''Star Trek'' had already been established\u2014the Bird of Prey's cloaking device, the transporter beam, et al.\u2014Mangini focused on making only small changes to them. The most important sounds were those created by the whales and the probe. Mangini's brother lived close to [[Roger Payne]], a biologist who had many recordings of whale song. Mangini went through the tapes and chose sounds that could be mixed to suggest a sort of language and conversation. The probe's screeching calls were the whale song in distorted form. The humpback's communication with the probe at the climax of the film contained no dramatic music, meaning that Mangini's sounds had to stand alone. He recalled that he had some difficulty with envisioning how the scene would unfold, leading Bennett to perform a [[puppet show]] to explain. Nimoy and the other producers were unhappy with Mangini's attempts to create the probe's droning operating noise; after 18 attempts, the [[sound designer]] finally asked Nimoy what he thought the probe should sound like, and recorded Nimoy's response. Nimoy's voice was distorted with \"just the tiniest bit of dressing\" and used as the final sound.<ref name=\"special features-abovetheline\">Special features, \"Below-the-Line: Sound Design\".</ref>\n\nThe punk music that blares during the bus scene was written by Thatcher after he learned that the audio to be added to the scene would be \"[[Duran Duran]], or whoever\" and not \"raw\" and authentic punk.<ref name=\"ign-kirk thatcher\">{{cite web|author=Plume, Kenneth|date=2000-02-10|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/035/035854p1.html|title=Interview with Kirk Thatcher (Part 1 of 2)|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2009-12-08}}</ref> Thatcher collaborated with Mangini and two [[Audio engineer|sound editors]] (who were in punk bands) to create their own music. They decided that punk distilled down to the sentiment of \"I hate you\", and wrote a sound to match. Recording in the sound studio as originally planned produced too clean a sound, so they moved to the outside hallway and recorded the entire band in one take using cheap microphones to create the distorted sound intended.<ref name=\"special features-onlocation\">Special features: \"On Location\".</ref> The song was later used for Paramount's \"[[Back to the Beach]]\".<ref name=\"ign-kirk thatcher\"/>\n\n====''Star Trek V: The Final Frontier'' (1989)====\nMusic critic [[Jeff Bond]] wrote that Shatner made \"at least two wise decisions\" in making ''[[Star Trek V: The Final Frontier|The Final Frontier]]''; he chose [[Laurence Luckinbill]] to play the role of Sybok, and he hired [[Jerry Goldsmith]] to compose the film's score. Goldsmith had written the Academy Award-nominated score for ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'', and the new ''Trek'' film was an opportunity to craft music with a similar level of ambition while adding action and character\u2014two elements largely missing from ''The Motion Picture''.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|133}}\n\nGoldsmith's main theme begins with the traditional opening notes from [[Alexander Courage]]'s original television series theme; an ascending string and electronic bridge leads to a rendition of the march from ''The Motion Picture''. According to Jeff Bond, Goldsmith's use of ''The Motion Picture''{{'}}s march led to some confusion among ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' fans, as they were unfamiliar with the music's origins and believed that Goldsmith was stealing the theme to ''The Next Generation'', which was itself ''The Motion Picture'' march.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|133}} Another theme from ''The Motion Picture'' that makes a return appearance is the Klingon theme from the 1979 film's opening scene. Here, the theme is treated in what Bond termed a \"Prokofiev-like style as opposed to the avant-garde counterpoint\" as seen in ''The Motion Picture''. Goldsmith also added a crying ram's horn.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|134}}\n\nThe breadth of ''The Final Frontier''{{'}}s locations led Goldsmith to eschew the two-themed approach of ''The Motion Picture'' in favor of [[leitmotif]]s, recurring music used for locations and characters. Sybok is introduced with a synthesized motif in the opening scene of the film, while when Kirk and Spock discuss him en route to Nimbus III it is rendered in a more mysterious fashion. The motif also appears in the action cue as Kirk and company land on Nimbus III and try to free the hostages.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|133}} When Sybok boards the ''Enterprise'', a new four-note motif played by low brass highlights the character's obsession. The Sybok theme from then on is used in either a benevolent sense or a more percussive, dark rendition. Arriving at Sha-ka-ree, the planet's five-note theme bears resemblance to Goldsmith's unicorn theme from ''Legend''; \"...the two melodies represent very similar ideas: lost innocence and the tragic impossibility of recapturing paradise,\" writes Bond. The music features cellos conveying a pious quality, while the appearance of \"God\" begins with string glissandos but turns to a dark rendition of Sybok's theme as its true nature is exposed.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|134}} As the creature attacks Kirk, Spock and McCoy, the more aggressive Sybok theme takes on an attacking rhythm. When Spock appeals to the Klingons for help, the theme takes on a sensitive character before returning to a powerful sequence as the ship destroys the god-creature.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|135}}\n\n====''Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country'' (1991)====\nDirector Nicholas Meyer's original plan for the score of ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country|The Undiscovered Country]]'' was to adapt [[Gustav Holst]]'s orchestral suite ''[[The Planets]]''. The plan proved unfeasibly expensive, so Meyer began listening to demo tapes submitted by composers.<ref name=\"linernotes-meyer1\">{{cite AV media notes |title=Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country Original Motion Picture Soundtrack |titlelink=|year=1991 |chapter=Director's notes |url= |first=Nicholas |last= Meyer|authorlink= Nicholas Meyer|pages= 2\u20133|type= |publisher=Famous Music Corporation |id= |location= }}</ref> Meyer described most of the demos as generic \"movie music\", but was intrigued by one tape by a young composer named [[Cliff Eidelman]]. Eidelman, then 26, had made a career in composing for ballets, television, and film, but despite work on fourteen features, no film had been the hit needed to propel Eidelman to greater fame.<ref>Schweiger, 8.</ref>\n\nIn conversations with Eidelman, Meyer mentioned that since the marches that accompanied the main titles for other ''Star Trek'' films were so good, he had no desire to compete with them by composing a bombastic opening. He also felt that since the film was darker than its predecessors, it demanded something different musically as a result. He mentioned the opening to [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Firebird]]'' as similar to the foreboding sound he wanted. Two days later Eidelman produced a tape of his idea for the main theme, played on a synthesizer. Meyer was impressed by the speed of the work and the close fit to his vision.<ref name=\"linernotes-meyer1\"/> Meyer approached producer Steven Charles-Jaffe with Eidelman's CD, which reminded Jaffe of [[Bernard Herrmann]]; Eidelman was given the task of composing the score.<ref name=\"special features-stories\">Special Features, \"Six Stories from Star Trek VI\".</ref>\n\nEidelman's previous project had been creating a compilation of music from the past five ''Star Trek'' films, and he consciously avoided taking inspiration from those scores. \"[The compilation] showed me what to stay away from, because I couldn't do [[James Horner]] [composer for ''The Wrath of Khan'' and ''The Search for Spock''] as well as James Horner,\" he said.<ref name=\"schweiger-9\">Schweiger, 9.</ref> Since he was hired early on in production, Eidelman had an unusually long time to develop his ideas, and he was able to visit the sets during filming. While the film was in early production Eidelman worked on electronic drafts of the final score, to placate executives who were unsure about using a relatively unknown composer.<ref name=\"schweiger-9\" />\n\nEidelman stated that he finds science fiction the most interesting and exciting genre to compose for, and that Meyer told him to treat the film as a fresh start, rather than drawing on old ''Star Trek'' themes.<ref name=\"special features-stories\"/> Eidelman wanted the music to aid the visuals; for Rura Penthe, he strove to create an atmosphere that reflected the alien and dangerous setting, introducing exotic instruments for color. Besides using percussion from around the world, Eidelman treated the choir as percussion, with the Klingon language translation for \"[[to be, or not to be]]\" (\"''taH pagh, taHbe''\") being repeated in the background. Spock's theme was designed to be an ethereal counterpart to the motif for Kirk and the ''Enterprise'', aimed at capturing \"the emotional gleam in the captain's eye\".<ref name=\"schweiger-10\">Schweiger, 10.</ref> Kirk's internal dilemma about what the future holds was echoed in the main theme: \"It's Kirk taking control one last time and as he looks out into the stars he has the spark again [...] But there's an unresolved note, because it's very important that he doesn't trust the Klingons. He doesn't want to go on this trip even though the spark is there that overtook him.\"<ref name=\"altman-46\">Altman, 46.</ref> For the climactic battle, Eidelman starts the music quietly, building the intensity as the battle progresses.<ref name=\"special features-stories\" />\n\n===''The Next Generation''===\n\n====''Star Trek Generations'' (1994)====\n[[Dennis McCarthy (composer)|Dennis McCarthy]], a composer who had worked on ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|The Next Generation]]'', was given the task of composing for ''[[Star Trek Generations]]''. Critic [[Jeff Bond]] wrote that while McCarthy's score was \"tasked with straddling the styles of both series\", it also offered the opportunity for the composer to produce stronger dramatic writing. His opening music was an ethereal choral piece that plays while a floating champagne bottle tumbles through space. For the action scenes with the ''Enterprise''-B, McCarthy used low brass chords and touches. Kirk was given a brass motif accented by snare drums (a touch verboten during ''The Next Generation''), while the scene ends with a dissonant notes as Scott and Chekov discover Kirk has been blown into space.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|152}}\n\nMcCarthy expanded his brassy style for the film's action sequences, such as the battle over Veridian III and the crash-landing of the ''Enterprise''. For Picard's trip to the Nexus, more choral music and synthesizers accompany Picard's discovery of his family. The film's only distinct theme, a broad fanfare, first plays when Picard and Kirk meet. The theme blends McCarthy's theme for Picard from ''The Next Generation''{{'}}s first season, notes from the theme for ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', and [[Alexander Courage]]'s classic ''Star Trek'' fanfare.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|152}}\n\n====''Star Trek: First Contact'' (1996)====\nFilm composer [[Jerry Goldsmith]] scored ''[[Star Trek: First Contact|First Contact]]'', his third ''Star Trek'' feature. Goldsmith wrote a sweeping main title which begins with [[Alexander Courage]]'s classic [[Theme from Star Trek|''Star Trek'' fanfare]].<ref name=\"norman\"/> Instead of composing a menacing theme to underscore the Borg, Goldsmith wrote a pastoral theme linked to humanity's hopeful first contact. The theme uses a four-note motif used in Goldsmith's ''[[Star Trek V: The Final Frontier]]'' score, which is used in ''First Contact'' as a friendship theme and general thematic link.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|155\u2013156}} A menacing march with touches of synthesizers was used to represent the Borg. In addition to composing new music, Goldsmith used music from his previous ''Star Trek'' scores, including his theme from ''The Motion Picture''.<ref name=\"norman\">Norman.</ref> The Klingon theme from the same film is used to represent Worf.<ref name=\"larson\"/>\n\nBecause of delays with Paramount's ''[[The Ghost and the Darkness]]'', the already-short four week production schedule was cut to just three weeks. While Berman was concerned about the move,<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|158}} Goldsmith hired his son, [[Joel Goldsmith|Joel]], to assist.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|155}} The young composer provided additional music for the film, writing three cues based on his father's motifs<ref name=\"larson\">Larson.</ref> and a total of 22&nbsp;minutes of music.<ref name=\"norman\"/>  Joel used variations of his father's Borg music and the Klingon theme as Worf fights hand-to-hand<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|156}} (Joel said that he and his father decided to use the theme for Worf separately).<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|159}} When the Borg invade sickbay and the medical hologram distracts them, Joel wrote what critic [[Jeff Bond]] termed \"almost [[Aaron Copland|Coplandesque]]\" material of tuning strings and clarinet, but the cue was unused. While Joel composed many of the film's action cues, his father contributed to the spacewalk and ''Phoenix'' flight sequences. During the fight on the deflector dish, Goldsmith used low-register electronics punctuated by stabs of violent, dissonant strings.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|156}}\n\nIn a break with ''Star Trek'' film tradition, the soundtrack incorporated two licensed songs: [[Roy Orbison]]'s \"Ooby Dooby\" and [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]]'s \"Magic Carpet Ride\". [[GNP Crescendo Record Co.|GNP Crescendo]] president Neil Norman explained that the decision to include the tracks was controversial, but said that \"Frakes did the most amazing job of integrating those songs into the story that we had to use them\".<ref name=\"billboard-sprague nothing like the reel thing\"/>\n\nGNP released the ''First Contact'' soundtrack on December 2, 1996.<ref name=\"billboard-sprague nothing like the reel thing\">{{cite news|author=Sprague, David|date=1996-12-14|title=Nothing like the reel thing; Soundtrack and film score news|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref> The album contained 51&nbsp;minutes of music, with 35&nbsp;minutes of Jerry Goldsmith's score, 10&nbsp;minutes of additional music by Joel Goldsmith, \"Ooby Dooby\" and \"Magic Carpet Ride\".

''Insurrection'' opens with [[Alexander Courage]]'s ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' fanfare, also introducing a six-note motif used in many of the film's action sequences. The Ba'ku are scored with a pastoral theme, repeating harps, string sections and a woodwind solo. The Ba'ku's ability to slow time uses a variation of this music.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|164}}\n\nGoldsmith approached starship sequences with quick bursts of brass music. While observers are watching the Ba'ku unseen, Goldsmith employed a \"spying theme\". Composed of a piano, timpani percussion, and brass, the theme builds until interrupted by the action theme as Data opens fire. Goldsmith did not write a motif for the Son'a, choosing to score the action sequence without designating the Son'a as an antagonist (suggesting the film's revelation that the Son'a and Ba'ku are related.) The film's climax is scored with the action material, balanced by \"sense of wonder\" music similar to cues from ''The Motion Picture''.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|164}}\n\n====''Star Trek: Nemesis'' (2002)====\n{{Main|Star Trek: Nemesis (soundtrack)}}\n\nThe music to ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis|Nemesis]]'' was the final ''Star Trek'' score and penultimate film score composed and conducted by [[Jerry Goldsmith]] before his death in 2004 (not including his music for the 2003 film ''[[Timeline (2003 film)|Timeline]]'', which was rejected due to a complicated post-production process).  The score opens with [[Alexander Courage]]'s ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' fanfare, but quickly transitions into a much darker theme to accompany the conflict between the Reman and Romulan empires.  Goldsmith also composed a new 5-note theme to accompany the character [[Shinzon]] and the ''Scimitar'', which is manipulated throughout the score to reflect the multiple dimensions of the character.  Goldsmith also incorporated a number of zipping, swooshing synthesizers into the conventional orchestra to illustrate the suspenseful and horrific elements of the story.  The score is book-ended with Goldsmith's theme from ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'', following a brief excerpt from the popular 1929 song \"[[Blue Skies (1926 song)|Blue Skies]]\" by [[Irving Berlin]].<ref>Clemmensen, Christian.

Montgomery]],  ''[[Jane of Lantern Hill]]''. The film was co-produced by Sullivan Entertainment, the [[Disney]] Channel and CBC.\n\nFor the production of the film, ''Lantern Hill'' was filmed using the same house used for Sullivan's earlier production, ''[[Anne of Green Gables (1985 film)|Anne of Green Gables]]'', though painted orange.  Many of the actors and actresses from ''Anne of Green Gables'', ''[[Anne of Green Gables: The Sequel]]'', and ''[[Road to Avonlea]]'' made appearances in this film.\n\n==Synopsis==\n12 year old Jane Stuart (Mairon Bennett) has long been told by her Grandmother Kennedy ([[Zoe Caldwell]]) that her father is dead. But when her mother, Robin Stuart (Patricia Phillips) returns home after recovering from a long illness, Jane learns that her mysterious father, Andrew Stuart ([[Sam Waterston]]) is still alive.

Montgomery]],  ''[[Jane of Lantern Hill]]''. The film was co-produced by Sullivan Entertainment, the [[Disney]] Channel and CBC.\n\nFor the production of the film, ''Lantern Hill'' was filmed using the same house used for Sullivan's earlier production, ''[[Anne of Green Gables]]'', though painted orange.  Many of the actors and actresses from ''[[Anne of Green Gables]]'', ''[[Anne of Green Gables: The Sequel]]'', and ''[[Road to Avonlea]]'' made appearances in this film.\n\n==Synopsis==\n12 year old Jane Stuart (Mairon Bennett) has long been told by her Grandmother Kennedy ([[Zoe Caldwell]]) that her father is dead. But when her mother, Robin Stuart (Patricia Phillips) returns home after recovering from a long illness, Jane learns that her mysterious father, Andrew Stuart ([[Sam Waterston]]) is still alive. When Jane finally meets her father and travels with him to Prince Edward Island to stay at Lantern Hill, their family home, she discovers that he is a kind man that cares deeply for both her and her mother. Determined to bring her parents back together, Jane enlists the aid of Hepzibah ([[Colleen Dewhurst]]), a powerful mystic, to help her solve an old mystery that has torn apart her family.\nIn a subplot, Jody Turner ([[Sarah Polley]]) is an abused servant girl who lives next door to Jane.

Its informal name in Puerto Rico arises from the [[feast day]] of [[Saint Roch]], or San Roque in Spanish, which coincided with the hurricane's landfall on that island.{{#tag:ref|The Puerto Rican tradition of referring to intense hurricanes by the names of Catholic saints being commemorated on the corresponding [[feast day]]s was among the earliest informal [[tropical cyclone naming]] systems, and lasted for centuries prior to the introduction of standardized naming conventions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tropical Cyclone Naming History and Retired Names|agency=[[National Hurricane Center]]|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=April 9, 2020|url=https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutnames_history.shtml}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Yanez, Anthony|date=September 7, 2017|title=From Adrian to Zelda: A History of Hurricane Names|newspaper=[[KNBC|NBC4 Southern California]]|url=https://www.nbclosangeles.com/local/how-hurricanes-get-their-names-storms-weather/23317/|accessdate=April 9, 2020}}</ref> This was the third storm bearing the local name \"San Roque\".<ref name=\"meta\"/> See also: [[Calendar of saints#Connection to tropical cyclones|Calendar of saints \u00a7 Connection to tropical cyclones]].|group=\"nb\"}} In Nova Scotia, the storm was called the \"Second Great August Gale\". For a short time on August 22, it was one of four simultaneously active hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean. The system was first observed on August 13 at low latitudes east of the [[Lesser Antilles]]. It grew to be a powerful, slow-moving hurricane in the [[Caribbean Sea]], and at 00:00 [[UTC]] on August 17, it struck Puerto Rico at the equivalence of Category 3 on the modern-day [[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]]. The [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] crossed the island from southeast to northwest, spending seven hours over the island. This was the first tropical cyclone event in Puerto Rico in which [[History of Atlantic hurricane warnings|warning flags]] were used for communicating the level of danger to the public. A prolonged period of strong winds caused widespread destruction on the island, most notably along the northern coast. A large number of homes sustained varying degrees of damage, with flimsy shacks belonging to poor workers faring the worst; many families were left homeless. Telegraph communications were severed across the island. Around the capital city of [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], many trees and fences were blown down, and two hospitals were unroofed. In addition to the deleterious winds, several days of heavy rainfall in interior sectors triggered extensive river flooding. The combined effects of rain and wind destroyed fields of crops, most notably coffee and sugar cane. Four people were killed in Puerto Rico.\n\nOn August 19, the hurricane began to turn northeastward and accelerate. Although its center remained far away from the [[United States]], heavy rainfall and gale-force winds overspread the country's [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] on August 20 and 21. Eastern [[New England]] experienced conditions equivalent to a particularly intense [[nor'easter]], with winds as high as {{convert|72|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} recorded on [[Block Island]]. Across [[Rhode Island]] and [[Massachusetts]], grain crops were flattened and orchards were stripped of their fruit. The esteemed racing yacht [[Volunteer (yacht)|''Volunteer'']] was badly damaged after crashing upon the rocky shoreline. After passing about {{convert|150|mi|km|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Nantucket]], the now-rapidly moving system weakened and transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]], and at 00:00 UTC on August 22, made landfall in Nova Scotia at [[St. Margarets Bay, Nova Scotia|St. Margarets Bay]]. Damage to utility wires in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] cut power and communications services, and a child was electrocuted to death by a downed power line. The storm wrought havoc on ships and boats throughout [[Atlantic Canada]], as well as the [[Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula]] of [[Quebec]], becoming \"one of the most notorious marine storms in the history of Nova Scotia\".<ref name=\"wreck\"/> The greatest maritime tragedy was the wreck of the [[steamship]] ''Dorcas'' and its barge, ''Etta Stewart'', which were caught in the gale while underway east of Halifax. The two ships drifted toward shore late at night on August 21, and struck a rocky [[shoal]] near the entrance to [[Three Fathom Harbour, Nova Scotia|Three Fathom Harbour]]. ''Dorcas'' capsized and was driven ashore, while ''Etta Stewart'' broke up in the pounding surf. All crew members and passengers on the two vessels, totaling 24 people, were killed. Two more people died when their boat sank on [[Trinity Bay (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Trinity Bay]] in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], for a storm total of 31 fatalities. \n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{storm path|1893 Atlantic hurricane 3 track.png}}\nBecause of scarce meteorological observations, little is known about Hurricane San Roque's early history.

For a short time on August 22, it was one of four simultaneously active hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean. The system was first observed on August 13 at low latitudes east of the [[Lesser Antilles]]. It grew to be a powerful, slow-moving hurricane in the [[Caribbean Sea]], and at 00:00 [[UTC]] on August 17, it struck Puerto Rico at the equivalence of Category 3 on the modern-day [[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]]. The [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] crossed the island from southeast to northwest, spending seven hours over the island. This was the first tropical cyclone event in Puerto Rico in which [[History of Atlantic hurricane warnings|warning flags]] were used for communicating the level of danger to the public. A prolonged period of strong winds caused widespread destruction on the island, most notably along the northern coast. A large number of homes sustained varying degrees of damage, with flimsy shacks belonging to poor workers faring the worst; many families were left homeless. Telegraph communications were severed across the island. Around the capital city of [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], many trees and fences were blown down, and two hospitals were unroofed. In addition to the deleterious winds, several days of heavy rainfall in interior sectors triggered extensive river flooding. The combined effects of rain and wind destroyed fields of crops, most notably coffee and sugar cane. Four people were killed in Puerto Rico.\n\nOn August 19, the hurricane began to turn northeastward and accelerate. Although its center remained far away from the [[United States]], heavy rainfall and gale-force winds overspread the country's [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] on August 20 and 21. Eastern [[New England]] experienced conditions equivalent to a particularly intense [[nor'easter]], with winds as high as {{convert|72|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} recorded on [[Block Island]]. Across [[Rhode Island]] and [[Massachusetts]], grain crops were flattened and orchards were stripped of their fruit. The esteemed racing yacht [[Volunteer (yacht)|''Volunteer'']] was badly damaged after crashing upon the rocky shoreline. After passing about {{convert|150|mi|km|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Nantucket]], the now-rapidly moving system weakened and transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]], and at 00:00 UTC on August 22, made landfall in Nova Scotia at [[St. Margarets Bay, Nova Scotia|St. Margarets Bay]]. Damage to utility wires in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] cut power and communications services, and a child was electrocuted to death by a downed power line. The storm wrought havoc on ships and boats throughout [[Atlantic Canada]], as well as the [[Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula]] of [[Quebec]], becoming \"one of the most notorious marine storms in the history of Nova Scotia\".<ref name=\"wreck\"/> The greatest maritime tragedy was the wreck of the [[steamer]]{{dn|date=April 2020}} ''Dorcas'' and its barge, ''Etta Stewart'', which were caught in the gale while underway east of Halifax. The two ships drifted toward shore late at night on August 21, and struck a rocky [[shoal]] near the entrance to [[Three Fathom Harbour, Nova Scotia|Three Fathom Harbour]]. ''Dorcas'' capsized and was driven ashore, while ''Etta Stewart'' broke up in the pounding surf. All crew members and passengers on the two vessels, totaling 24 people, were killed.

Unlike the true synthesiser, sample-based equipment does not derive its raw sounds from electronic [[oscillator]]s but from recorded sounds held in [[read-only memory]] (ROM) chips. These sounds may then be layered, [[Filter (signal processing)|filtered]], modulated by [[low frequency oscillation]] and shaped by [[Attack-Decay-Sustain-Release|envelopes]]. However, unlike a true sampler, such devices do not allow the user to record sounds but instead offer a range of factory sounds suitable for any given use. This type of sound production dominated electronic music production for several years in the late 20th century. The exclusive license for re-formatting and managing historical E-MU Proteus sound content has been acquired by [[Digital Sound Factory]].\n\n==Models==\n\nThe Proteus range was developed into several models, some differing from each other only by the sound banks they contained, which were optimised for different purposes. However, since most allowed four ROM chips to be mounted, and these chips were available separately, real differences might be simply cosmetic. The available ROM chips included the Composer, a work-horse set of sounds useful for popular music production, three orchestral ROMs, the Vintage Keys collection of electric organs, pianos and classic synthesisers, a chip dedicated to the Hammond organ and a drum ROM as well as the Orbit and Mo-Phatt collections, aimed at dance and urban genres and the Xtreme Lead, optimised for monophonic synthesiser soloing. The original Proteus trilogy contains 192 patches each (Proteus 1, Proteus 2 and Proteus 3). However, they could be also upgraded by obtaining XR versions, having extra [[read-only memory]] (ROM) for more sound patches, that would have 384 each.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:left;border:0;background:RGBA(255,255,255,0);padding:0;font-size:85%;\"\n|-\n|[[File:E-mu Proteus 1 Pop Rock.jpg|220px]] ||'''Proteus 1''' Pop/Rock (1990)\n|-\n|  ||'''Proteus 1''' XR (1990)\n|-\n|  ||'''Proteus 1''' Plus Orchestral (1990)\n|-\n|  ||'''Proteus 2''' Orchestral (1990)\n|-\n|  ||'''Proteus 2''' XR (1990)\n|-\n|  ||'''Proteus 3''' World (1991)\n|-\n|  ||'''Proteus 3''' XR (1991)\n|-\n|  ||'''Pro/Cussion''' (1991)\n|-\n|[[File:E-mu ProteusFX.jpg|220px]] ||'''Proteus FX''' (1994)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1994_articles/may94/emuproteusfx.html|title=Emu Proteus FX|work=Sound On Sound|date=May 1994|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150608013716/http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1994_articles/may94/emuproteusfx.html|archivedate=8 June 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n|  ||'''UltraProteus''' (1994)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polynominal.com/site/studio/gear/synth/emu-ultraproteus/index.html|title=polynominal Emu Proteus}}</ref>\n|-\n|-\n|[[File:Plannet Phatt, Orbit.jpg|220px]]\n|'''Planet Phatt''' [Hip-Hop] (1997)<br/>'''Orbit''' [Techno/Electronica] (1996)\n|- style=\"line-height:3ex;\"\n|[[File:Mo'Phatt, Turbo Phatt, Xtreme Lead-1.jpg|220px]]\n|'''Xtreme Lead-1''' [Techno/Electronica] (2000)<br/>'''Mo'Phatt''' [Hip-Hop] (2000) &nbsp;<br/>'''Turbo Phatt''' [Hip-Hop] (2002)\n|}\n\n[[File:E-MU-System Orbit V2.jpg|220px|thumb|Internals of an ORBIT V2 with its beat mode: [[File:EMU_ORBIT_9090_V2_-_Dance_Beat_Patterns.ogg|right|Beat Mode]]]]\n{{clear left}}\n\nThough the Proteus was mainly known as a keyboardless [[MIDI]] sound module, E-mu also marketed the Proteus MPS (Master Performance System), a 61-key keyboard version of the Proteus module.\n\n==Proteus 2000==\n[[File:E-mu Proteus 2000 (small).png|thumb|E-mu Proteus 2000 (1998/1999)]]\n\nThe '''Proteus 2000''' released in 1999 was a 1U rack sound module based on Audity 2000 released in 1998.

It was equipped with sixteen multi-function pads and the same number of programmable knobs and had an onboard [[Music sequencer|sequencer]].\n\n[[File:E-mu Launch Pad.jpg|thumb|Launch-Pad controller for Orbit in 1996 may be a forerunner of Command Station]]\n\n==Command Station==\nIn 2001 the Proteus line of modules was repackaged in the form of a line of tabletop units, the XL7 and MP7 Command Stations, broadly similar to the rack-mounted 2500 in features but featuring touch-sensitive pads suitable for recording drum patterns.\n\n==MK-6/PK-6/Halo==\n[[File:E-mu PK-6 Proteus Key.jpg|thumb|E-mu PK-6 (Pop/Rock) - 2001]]\n\nIn 2001-2002, E-mu/Ensoniq released a trio of entry-level keyboards, essentially the keyboard versions of the Proteus 2500 module. The E-mu MK-6, XK-6, PK-6 and Ensoniq Halo featured the same 61-key keyboard and controls layout, but slightly different soundset.\n\n==Software editor==\nProdatum<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = prodatum\n  | publisher = Jan Eidtmann\n  | url = http://prodatum.sf.net\n  | accessdate = 2011-04-02}}\n</ref> is a cross-platform software editor for the Proteus 1000/2000, Command Stations and keyboard versions. prodatum is free software.\n\nProteum<ref>{{cite web\n | title = proteum\n | publisher = Keith Young\n | url = http://www.emigr8.me.uk/music/tools/proteum.htm\n | accessdate = 2011-10-13}}</ref> is a free Windows software editor for Proteus and Command Stations.\n\n==OS updates==\nSince Creative withdrew their provision of historical OS updates and manuals for most of the older E-Mu gear sometime around August 2011,<ref>{{cite web \n| title = yahoo group post\n| publisher = steve the composer\n| url = http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/xl7/message/22103\n| accessdate = 2011-11-09}}</ref> many of these files have been made available elsewhere, such as\n[http://www.e-univercity.com/SynthGearDocs/ Synth Gear Docs Archive] and [http://francisfisher.me.uk/problem/2011/emu-legacy-archive/ the E-Mu Legacy Archive].\n\n==Notable users==\nThe following artists have used an E-mu Proteus series sampler in their recordings.\n*[[Andrew McCrourie-Shand]] used Proteus 2 Orchestral and Proteus 3 World for [[Teletubbies]].\n*[[Bob Singleton]] used the multiple patches from the E-mu Proteus 2 in [[Barney & Friends]] from Seasons 1-3. \n*[[Dave Kinnoin (composer)|Dave Kinnoin]] & [[Jimmy Hammer (composer)|Jimmy Hammer]] used Proteus 2 Orchestral for the North American and the International versions for [[Spot (franchise)]].\n*[[Eric Serra]] used Proteus 2 Orchestral for the Infinite One patch (Patch #86) to make a deep low octave sound effect for the [[GoldenEye|Goldeneye film]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://freesound.org/people/stringly/sounds/197904/|title=\"GoldenEye Sound.wav\" by stringly}}</ref> \n*[[Mark Snow]] known for utilizing the Whistl'n Joe instrument patch (Patch #125) for [[The X-Files]] theme. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/wnxn8y/radio-motherboard-mark-snow-and-the-truth-of-the-x-files-music |title=How The 'X Files' Composer Made TV's Creepiest Theme Song, Partly By Accident |publisher=motherboard.vice.com |date=2016-03-16 |accessdate=2018-07-12}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.syfy.com/syfywire/the-x-files-composer-mark-snow-talks-creating-one-of-the-most-recognizable-sci-fi-theme |title= The X-Files composer Mark Snow talks creating one of the most recognizable sci-fi theme songs of all time  |publisher=syfy.com |date=2018-05-14 |accessdate=2018-07-12}}</ref>\n* [[Mike O'Donnell (composer)|Mike O'Donnell]] and [[Junior Campbell]] used Proteus 1, 2, 3, and 2000 along with the Virtuoso 2000 for the soundtracks between Seasons 3 to 7 of the children's television series [[Thomas The Tank Engine & Friends]]. \n* [[Rowland Lee (composer)]] used Proteus 2 Orchestral for [[Little Bear]] (Seasons 1-5) (1995-1999), [[Arthur (TV series)|Arthur]] (Seasons 1-8) (1996-2003), [[Judy The 11 Year Old Daughter Girl]] (Season 1) (1999), [[Pablo the Little Red Fox]] (Season 1 in the British English and the International versions in the Full Screen) (1999) and [[64 Zoo Lane]] (Seasons 1-2 in the American English and the International versions in the Full Screen) (1999-2000).\n\nand more...\n\n==References==\n* {{cite web|title=Product History |url=http://www.emu.com/corporate/history/timeline.asp |publisher=E-MU Systems |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809123323/http://www.emu.com/corporate/history/timeline.asp |archivedate=2011-08-09 }}\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:E-Mu Proteus 2500}}\n[[Category:E-mu synthesizers]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toLittle Bear(link changed toLittle Bear (TV series)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-mu_Proteus"}
