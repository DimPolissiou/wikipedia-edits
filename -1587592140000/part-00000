These symbols are explained in a key, typically located in the front of the journal. Information can be organized into tasks, events, and notes, but the possibilities are endless.\n\nLogs are to-do lists, organized on different time-scales, including daily, weekly, monthly, and future logs. Logs are often called spreads, since they typically spread across two adjacent pages.\n\nCollections make up the bulk of a bullet journal, and organize information by content - these can be logs, lists, trackers, etc. \n\nOther popular collections include habit and mood trackers, fitness or diet trackers, list of books to read, restaurants to try, etc.\n\nDescribed as the \"cornerstone\" of bullet journaling,<ref name=\":4\" /> migration is the practice of periodically updating lists to new lists, such as carrying over unfinished tasks from one month's log to the next.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://bulletjournal.com/pages/learn |title=Learn |website=Bullet Journal |language=en |access-date=2019-04-25}}</ref> This helps users stay organized, productive, and on task by allowing them to prioritize what things need to get done, and what can be placed on hold.

The only route open to Martin was to ask the Dominicans of Holy Rosary Priory in Lima to accept him as a ''donado'', a volunteer who performed menial tasks in the monastery in return for the privilege of wearing the habit and living with the religious community.<ref name=\"craughwell\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.franciscanmedia.org/patron-saints-for-modern-challenges/|title=Patron Saints for Modern Challenges|last=Craughwell|first=Thomas J.|date=2016-09-01|website=Franciscan Media|language=en|access-date=2019-07-04}}</ref> At the age of 15 he asked for admission to the Dominican Convent of the Rosary in Lima and was received first as a servant boy, and as his duties grew he was promoted to [[almoner]].\n\nMartin continued to practice his old trades of barbering and healing and was said to have performed many miraculous cures. He also took on kitchen work, laundry, and cleaning. After eight years at Holy Rosary, the [[prior]] Juan de Lorenzana decided to turn a blind eye to the law and permit Martin to take his vows as a member of the [[Third Order of Saint Dominic]]. Holy Rosary was home to 300 men, not all of whom accepted the decision of De Lorenzana: one of the novices called Martin a \"[[mulatto]] dog\", while one of the priests mocked him for being illegitimate and descended from slaves.<ref name=craughwell/>\n\nWhen Martin was 24, he was allowed to profess [[religious vows]] as a Dominican lay brother in 1603. He is said to have several times refused this elevation in status, which may have come about due to his father's intervention, and he never became a priest.<ref name=ewb/> It is said that when his [[convent]] was in debt, he implored them: \"I am only a poor mulatto, sell me.\" Martin was deeply attached to the [[Blessed Sacrament]], and he was praying in front of it one night when the step of the altar he was kneeling on caught fire. Throughout all the confusion and chaos that followed, he remained where he was, unaware of what was happening around him.<ref>Biography in ''The Saint Martin De Porres Prayer Book'', pp. 147-152.</ref>\n\n[[File:Martin of porres.jpeg|left|thumb|A mid-twentieth century stained glass representation of Martin de Porres in [[St Pancras Church, Ipswich]] with a broom, rosary, parrot and monkey]]\nWhen Martin was 34, after he had been given the [[religious habit]] of a lay brother, he was assigned to the [[infirmary]], where he was placed in charge and would remain in service until his death at the age of 59. He was known for his care of the sick.<ref name=aar/> His superiors saw in him the virtues necessary to exercise unfailing patience in this difficult role. It was not long before miracles were attributed to him. Martin also cared for the sick outside his convent, often bringing them healing with only a simple glass of water. He ministered without distinction to Spanish nobles and to slaves recently brought from Africa.<ref name=ewb>[http://www.notablebiographies.com/supp/Supplement-Mi-So/Porres-Mart-n.html \"Martin Porres\", Encyclopedia of World Biography]</ref> One day an aged beggar, covered with ulcers and almost naked, stretched out his hand, and Martin took him to his own bed. One of his brethren reproved him. Martin replied: \"Compassion, my dear Brother, is preferable to cleanliness.\"\n\nWhen an epidemic struck Lima, there were in this single Convent of the Rosary 60 friars who were sick, many of them novices in a distant and locked section of the convent, separated from the professed. Martin is said to have passed through the locked doors to care for them, a phenomenon which was reported in the residence more than once. The professed, too, saw him suddenly beside them without the doors having been opened. Martin continued to transport the sick to the convent until the [[provincial superior]], alarmed by the contagion threatening the friars, forbade him to continue to do so. His sister, who lived in the country, offered her house to lodge those whom the residence of the religious could not hold. One day he found on the street a poor Indian, bleeding to death from a dagger wound, and took him to his own room until he could transport him to his sister's hospice. The prior, when he heard of this, reprimanded him for disobedience. He was extremely edified, however, by his reply: \"Forgive my error, and please instruct me, for I did not know that the precept of obedience took precedence over that of charity.\"<ref name=granger>Granger O.P., Fr.

By the time he died, on 3 November 1639, he had won the affection and respect of many of his fellow Dominicans as well as a host of people outside the priory.<ref name=craughwell/> Word of his miracles had made him known as a saint throughout the region. As his body was displayed to allow the people of the city to pay their respects, each person snipped a tiny piece of his habit to keep as a relic. It is said that three habits were taken from the body. His body was then interred in the grounds of the monastery.\n\nAfter De Porres died, the miracles and graces received when he was invoked multiplied in such profusion that his body was exhumed after 25 years and said to be found intact, and exhaling a fine fragrance.

The only route open to Martin was to ask the Dominicans of Holy Rosary Priory in Lima to accept him as a ''donado'', a volunteer who performed menial tasks in the monastery in return for the privilege of wearing the habit and living with the religious community.<ref name=\"craughwell\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.franciscanmedia.org/patron-saints-for-modern-challenges/|title=Patron Saints for Modern Challenges|last=Craughwell|first=Thomas J.|date=2016-09-01|website=Franciscan Media|language=en|access-date=2019-07-04}}</ref> At the age of 15 he asked for admission to the Dominican Convent of the Rosary in Lima and was received first as a servant boy, and as his duties grew he was promoted to [[almoner]].\n\nMartin continued to practice his old trades of barbering and healing and was said to have performed many miraculous cures. He also took on kitchen work, laundry, and cleaning. After eight years at Holy Rosary, the [[prior]] Juan de Lorenzana decided to turn a blind eye to the law and permit Martin to take his vows as a member of the [[Third Order of Saint Dominic]]. Holy Rosary was home to 300 men, not all of whom accepted the decision of De Lorenzana: one of the novices called Martin a \"[[mulatto]] dog\", while one of the priests mocked him for being illegitimate and descended from slaves.<ref name=craughwell/>\n\nWhen Martin was 24, he was allowed to profess [[religious vows]] as a Dominican lay brother in 1603. He is said to have several times refused this elevation in status, which may have come about due to his father's intervention, and he never became a priest.<ref name=ewb/> It is said that when his [[convent]] was in debt, he implored them: \"I am only a poor mulatto, sell me.\" Martin was deeply attached to the [[Blessed Sacrament]], and he was praying in front of it one night when the step of the altar he was kneeling on caught fire.

He was known for his care of the sick.<ref name=aar/> His superiors saw in him the virtues necessary to exercise unfailing patience in this difficult role. It was not long before miracles were attributed to him. Martin also cared for the sick outside his convent, often bringing them healing with only a simple glass of water. He ministered without distinction to Spanish nobles and to slaves recently brought from Africa.<ref name=ewb>[http://www.notablebiographies.com/supp/Supplement-Mi-So/Porres-Mart-n.html \"Martin Porres\", Encyclopedia of World Biography]</ref> One day an aged beggar, covered with ulcers and almost naked, stretched out his hand, and Martin took him to his own bed. One of his brethren reproved him. Martin replied: \"Compassion, my dear Brother, is preferable to cleanliness.\"\n\nWhen an epidemic struck Lima, there were in this single Convent of the Rosary 60 friars who were sick, many of them novices in a distant and locked section of the convent, separated from the professed. Martin is said to have passed through the locked doors to care for them, a phenomenon which was reported in the residence more than once. The professed, too, saw him suddenly beside them without the doors having been opened. Martin continued to transport the sick to the convent until the [[provincial superior]], alarmed by the contagion threatening the friars, forbade him to continue to do so. His sister, who lived in the country, offered her house to lodge those whom the residence of the religious could not hold. One day he found on the street a poor Indian, bleeding to death from a dagger wound, and took him to his own room until he could transport him to his sister's hospice. The prior, when he heard of this, reprimanded him for disobedience.

But before Emily can confess her true feelings, the ceremony is crashed by the bank-robbing Bad Elvis Gang, who are on the prowl for the Heart of Dresden, a $250 million necklace on loan for the event. But when the heist goes awry and the local sheriff's department surrounds the chapel, Emily will become the unlikely ringleader of her own hostage situation in a last-ditch attempt to escape walking down the aisle. Teaming up with head bank robber Tom, Emily must navigate the police, her dysfunctional family, and her own romantic past if she wants to get out of this chapel in one piece. \n\n== Characters ==\n*'''Emily''' is a wealthy bride who struggles with her impending nuptials to Jesse, an awkward but well-meaning architect.
