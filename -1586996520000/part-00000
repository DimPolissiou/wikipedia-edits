Davis was never comfortable living under the microscope at [[Victoria Park, Melbourne|Victoria Park]], where the expectations placed upon him were magnified by the spectre of his father's courageous attitude to the game and triumph over adversity, combined with the Magpie fans' insatiable desire for success.\n\nAfter 16 games in his debut season, a homesick Davis fled back to Sydney after just two days of his second pre-season campaign. It took two weeks for him to regain enough composure to return to Melbourne.\n\nAt the end of his two-year contract, Davis re-signed and rewarded the club's faith with a solid year, kicking 36 goals in 21 games. But after an injury-riddled pre-season in 2002 and some indifferent performances early in the year, pressure mounted on Davis to re-sign with the Magpies. He said he wanted to wait until the end of the season, a decision that did not go down well with the Magpie hierarchy.\n\nAfter playing 20 games \u2013 including a cracker against [[Adelaide Crows|Adelaide]] in the [[preliminary final]] win that steered Collingwood into the [[2002 AFL Grand Final|2002 Grand Final]] \u2013 Davis told the Magpies he wanted to go home. A last-minute trade \u2013 a bargain that cost the Swans just a second round pick in the 2002 draft \u2013 paved the way for Davis to move home.\n\n== Sydney career ==\n\nHe hit the ground running in 2003 with 32 goals in 24 appearances before injuries again interceded in 2004; first hip, then ankle. The rigours of rehabilitating an injured ankle quickly eroded Davis's desire to play footy. For two days in June 2004, the club did not know of his whereabouts and when he did return, he was having serious thoughts about shifting to [[rugby league]].\n\nDavis' enthusiasm eventually returned and, although he showed glimpses of his best (like the three impressive goals in the round 21 win over the [[Essendon Football Club|Bombers]] at [[Telstra Stadium]]), he carried the remnants of the hip and ankle injuries through the year.\n\n== 2005 \u2013 Realising potential ==\n\nDespite a three-week stint on the sidelines with a hamstring strain mid-year, Davis's form continually improved throughout 2005. He was rewarded for his superior fitness with the occasional run through the midfield, while 12 of his 31 goals for the season came in the final month.\n\n===2005 semi-final===\n{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center\n|width=30%\n|align=right\n|quote=Siren could go any second.

In a low-scoring game at the small [[Sydney Cricket Ground]], Sydney trailed 3.12 (30) to 6.11 (47) at three-quarter time, which increased to a 23 point margin after Davis' direct opponent, [[David Johnson (Australian rules footballer)|David Johnson]], kicked the opening goal of the final quarter.\n\nDavis then recovered to kick the last four goals of the game, delivering Sydney a three-point victory, 7.14 (56) d. 7.11 (53). His first three goals came from two difficult snaps and a set-shot, and the last came from a stoppage in the final five seconds of the game. The ball-up twenty metres from the Swans' goal was tapped to a running Davis by ruckman [[Jason Ball (Australian footballer)|Jason Ball]]. Davis did not have time to take a clean possession, and on the wrong side of the goal for a right-footed player of his nature. Davis juggled the ball before snapping a shot with his left-foot, kicking a goal to put Sydney ahead with just three seconds remaining.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Age|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/goalden-moment-20110415-1di21.html|title=Goal-den moment|date=16 April 2011|author=Michael Cowley|accessdate=12 January 2015}}</ref> It is considered one of the greatest individual quarters of football ever played.\n\nAs a result of Davis' heroics, Sydney progressed to the preliminary final against St Kilda. Sydney won that game, and went on to win the [[2005 AFL Grand Final|2005 Grand Final]] against {{AFL WCE}} to end a 72-year club premiership drought.\n\n===\"I'm a scapegoat\"===\nIn round 14 of 2006 after the Swans had played Adelaide at the SCG, Nick Davis was dropped from the seniors and sent to the reserves. This proved to be a major challenge for Davis after an outcry to the media Paul Roos was furious and kept him playing in the reserves for 6 weeks. However, he came back in round 21 and played all the remaining games of the season, including the 2006 GF where he was one of Sydneys best kicking 3 majors.\n\n==2008\u2013present==\n\nNick Davis played only three games for the Swans in 2008, after being dropped for a period and then being brought back in to cover during Barry Hall's seven-match suspension for striking Brent Staker.

He said he wanted to wait until the end of the season, a decision that did not go down well with the Magpie hierarchy.\n\nAfter playing 20 games \u2013 including a cracker against [[Adelaide Crows|Adelaide]] in the [[preliminary final]] win that steered Collingwood into the [[2002 AFL Grand Final|2002 Grand Final]] \u2013 Davis told the Magpies he wanted to go home. A last-minute trade \u2013 a bargain that cost the Swans just a second round pick in the 2002 draft \u2013 paved the way for Davis to move home.\n\n== Sydney career ==\n\nHe hit the ground running in 2003 with 32 goals in 24 appearances before injuries again interceded in 2004; first hip, then ankle. The rigours of rehabilitating an injured ankle quickly eroded Davis's desire to play footy. For two days in June 2004, the club did not know of his whereabouts and when he did return, he was having serious thoughts about shifting to [[rugby league]].\n\nDavis' enthusiasm eventually returned and, although he showed glimpses of his best (like the three impressive goals in the round 21 win over the [[Essendon Football Club|Bombers]] at [[Telstra Stadium]]), he carried the remnants of the hip and ankle injuries through the year.\n\n== 2005 \u2013 Realising potential ==\n\nDespite a three-week stint on the sidelines with a hamstring strain mid-year, Davis's form continually improved throughout 2005. He was rewarded for his superior fitness with the occasional run through the midfield, while 12 of his 31 goals for the season came in the final month.\n\n===2005 semi-final===\n{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center\n|width=30%\n|align=right\n|quote=Siren could go any second.

In a low-scoring game at the small [[Sydney Cricket Ground]], Sydney trailed 3.12 (30) to 6.11 (47) at three-quarter time, which increased to a 23 point margin after Davis' direct opponent, [[David Johnson (Australian rules footballer)|David Johnson]], kicked the opening goal of the final quarter.\n\nDavis then recovered to kick the last four goals of the game, delivering Sydney a three-point victory, 7.14 (56) d. 7.11 (53). His first three goals came from two difficult snaps and a set-shot, and the last came from a stoppage in the final five seconds of the game. The ball-up twenty metres from the Swans' goal was tapped to a running Davis by ruckman [[Jason Ball (Australian footballer)|Jason Ball]]. Davis did not have time to take a clean possession, and on the wrong side of the goal for a right-footed player of his nature. Davis juggled the ball before snapping a shot with his left-foot, kicking a goal to put Sydney ahead with just three seconds remaining.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Age|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/goalden-moment-20110415-1di21.html|title=Goal-den moment|date=16 April 2011|author=Michael Cowley|accessdate=12 January 2015}}</ref> It is considered one of the greatest individual quarters of football ever played.\n\nAs a result of Davis' heroics, Sydney progressed to the preliminary final against St Kilda. Sydney won that game, and went on to win the [[2005 AFL Grand Final|2005 Grand Final]] against {{AFL WCE}} to end a 72-year club premiership drought.\n\n===\"I'm a scapegoat\"===\nIn round 14 of 2006 after the Swans had played Adelaide at the SCG, Nick Davis was dropped from the seniors and sent to the reserves. This proved to be a major challenge for Davis after an outcry to the media Paul Roos was furious and kept him playing in the reserves for 6 weeks. However, he came back in round 21 and played all the remaining games of the season, including the 2006 GF where he was one of Sydneys best kicking 3 majors.\n\n==2008\u2013present==\n\nNick Davis played only three games for the Swans in 2008, after being dropped for a period and then being brought back in to cover during Barry Hall's seven-match suspension for striking Brent Staker. He played in the controversial draw against North Melbourne, when Sydney had an extra man on the field for 90 seconds near the end of the game,<ref name=\"Fine2011\">{{cite book|author=Mark Fine|title=The Book of Footy Lists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DA1SGBNzet0C&pg=PA107|year=2011|publisher=Slattery Media Group|isbn=978-1-921778-30-8|pages=107\u2013}}</ref> before again being dropped. He did not play another game for the Swans for the year after dislocating his kneecap and requiring surgery, and he was not offered another contract at the end of the season.\n\nDavis flagged an interest in moving to Perth to play for the West Coast Eagles when he came out of contract at the end of the 2008 season.<ref>[http://www.foxsports.com.au/afl/afl-premiership/i-want-to-join-the-eagles-davis/story-e6frf3au-1111116953941 I want to join the Eagles: Davis]</ref> He was delisted at the end of the year and was not selected in the [[2008 AFL Draft]].
