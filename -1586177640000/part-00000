{"title_page": "Mexican art", "text_new": "[[File:Maize Rivera.jpg|thumb|Detail of a mural by [[Diego Rivera]] at the [[National Palace (Mexico)]]]]\nVarious types of [[visual arts]] developed in the geographical area now known as Mexico. The development of these arts roughly follows the [[history of Mexico]], divided into the prehispanic [[Mesoamerican]] era, the [[New Spain|colonial period]], with the period after [[Mexican War of Independence]], the development Mexican national identity through art in the nineteenth century, and the florescence of modern '''Mexican art''' after the [[Mexican Revolution]] (1910-1920).\n\nMesoamerican art is that produced in an area that encompasses much of what is now central and southern Mexico, before the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]] for a period of about 3,000 years from Mexican Art can be bright and colourful this is called encopended. During this time, all influences on art production were indigenous, with art heavily tied to religion and the ruling class. There was little to no real distinction among art, architecture, and writing. The Spanish conquest led to 300 years of Spanish colonial rule, and art production remained tied to religion\u2014most art was associated with the construction and decoration of churches, but secular art expanded in the eighteenth century, particularly [[casta]] paintings, portraiture, and history painting. Almost all art produced was in the European tradition, with late colonial-era artists trained at the [[Academy of San Carlos]], but indigenous elements remained, beginning a continuous balancing act between European and indigenous traditions.<ref name=\"paz\">Paz, 1987 p.301.</ref>\n\nAfter Independence, art remained heavily European in style, but indigenous themes appeared in major works as liberal Mexico sought to distinguish itself from its Spanish colonial past. This preference for indigenous elements continued into the first half of the 20th century, with the [[Mexican muralism|Social Realism or Mexican muralist movement]] led by artists such as [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], [[Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco]], and [[Fernando Leal (artist)|Fernando Leal]], who were commissioned by the post-[[Mexican Revolution]] government to create a visual narrative of Mexican history and culture.\n\nThe strength of this artistic movement was such that it affected newly invented technologies, such as still photography and cinema, and strongly promoted popular arts and crafts as part of Mexico's identity. Since the 1950s, Mexican art has broken away from the muralist style and has been more globalized, integrating elements from Asia, with Mexican artists and filmmakers having an effect on the global stage.\n\n==Pre-Columbian art==\n{{See also|National Museum of Anthropology (Mexico)|Museo Diego Rivera Anahuacalli|Aztec codices}}\n[[File:Cavepaintings-loltun.jpg|thumb|left|Painting cave in [[Yucat\u00e1n (state)|Yucat\u00e1n]]]]\n[[File:Bonampak-7269.JPG|thumb|A Maya mural at [[Bonampak]], 8th century AD.]]\n\nIt is believed that the American continent's oldest rock art, 7500 years old, is found in a cave on the peninsula of Baja California.<ref>[http://www.elmundo.es/2002/12/12/ciencia/1292233.html Descubierta en una cueva de M\u00e9xico la pintura rupestre m\u00e1s antigua de Am\u00e9rica / EL MUNDO<!-- T\u00edtulo generado por un bot -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213061450/http://www.elmundo.es/2002/12/12/ciencia/1292233.html |date=February 13, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThe pre-Hispanic art of Mexico belongs to a cultural region known as [[Mesoamerica]], which roughly corresponds to central Mexico on into [[Central America]],<ref name=\"salvatvol1p4\">Rosas Volume 1, p.4.</ref> encompassing three thousand years from 1500 BCE to 1500 CE generally divided into three eras: Pre Classic, Classic and Post Classic.<ref name=\"salvat vol 1p11\">Rosas Volume 1, p.11.</ref> The first dominant Mesoamerican culture was that of the [[Olmec]]s, which peaked around 1200 BCE. The Olmecs originated much of what is associated with Mesoamerica, such as [[Mesoamerican writing systems|hieroglyphic writing]], [[Mesoamerican calendars|calendar]], first advances in astronomy, monumental sculpture ([[Olmec colossal heads|Olmec heads]]) and [[jade]] work.<ref name=\"pazp38\">Paz, 1987 p.38.</ref>\n\nThey were a forerunner of later cultures such as [[Teotihuacan]], north of Mexico City, the [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotecs]] in Oaxaca and the [[Mayan peoples|Mayas]] in southern Mexico, [[Belize]] and [[Guatemala]]. While empires rose and fell, the basic cultural underpinnings of the Mesoamerica stayed the same until the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]].<ref name=\"pazp38\"/> These included cities centered on plazas, temples usually built on pyramid bases, [[Mesoamerican ball court]]s and a mostly common cosmology.<ref name=\"salvatvol1p4\" />\n\n[[File:Tlatilco culture figurines.jpg|thumb|left|Female figurines from the [[Tlatilco culture]], 1250 to 800 BCE.]]\n\nWhile art forms such as cave paintings and rock etchings date from earlier, the known history of Mexican art begins with Mesoamerican art created by sedentary cultures that built cities, and often, dominions.<ref name=\"salvat vol 1p11\" /><ref name=\"pazp38\"/> While the art of Mesoamerica is more varied and extends over more time than anywhere else in the Americas, artistic styles show a number of similarities.<ref name=\"jflam\">{{cite news |title=Mexican Art Over Three Millennia |first=Jack |last=ver Flam |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |location=New York |date=October 9, 1990 |page=20}}</ref><ref name=\"salvatvol1p9\">Rosas Volume 1, p.9.</ref>\n\nUnlike modern Western art, almost all Mesoamerican art was created to serve religious or political needs, rather than art for art's sake. It is strongly based on nature, the surrounding political reality and the gods.<ref name=\"salvatvol1p12\" /> [[Octavio Paz]] states that \"Mesoamerican art is a logic of forms, lines, and volumes that is as the same time a cosmology.\" He goes on to state that this focus on space and time is highly distinct from European naturalism based on the representation of the human body. Even simple designs such as [[fretwork|stepped frets]] on buildings fall into this representation of space and time, life and the gods.<ref name=\"pazp41\">Paz, 1987 p.41.</ref>\n\n[[File:AztecSerpent.JPG|thumb|right|An aztec [[turquoise]] serpent chest ornament. At the [[British Museum]].]]\n\nArt was expressed on a variety of mediums such as ceramics, [[amate]] paper and architecture.<ref name=\"salvatvol1p9\" /> Most of what is known of Mesoamerican art comes from works that cover stone buildings and pottery, mostly paintings and reliefs.<ref name=\"jflam\" /> Ceramics date from the early the Mesoamerican period. They probably began as cooking and storage vessels but then were adapted to ritual and decorative uses. Ceramics were decorated by shaping, scratching, painting and different firing methods.<ref name=\"salvatvol1p12\">Rosas Volume 1, p.12.</ref>\n\n[[Image:TurquoiseAztecMask2.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Turquoise]] mask representing the god [[Tezcatlipoca]], from the [[British Museum]].]]\nThe earliest known purely artistic production were small ceramic figures that appeared in [[Tehuac\u00e1n, Puebla|Tehuac\u00e1n]] area around 1,500 BCE and spread to [[Veracruz]], the [[Valley of Mexico]], [[Guerrero]], [[Oaxaca]], [[Chiapas]] and the Pacific coast of Guatemala.<ref name=\"salvat vol 1p11\" /> The earliest of these are mostly female figures, probably associated with fertility rites because of their often oversized hips and thighs, as well as a number with babies in arms or nursing. When male figures appear they are most often soldiers.<ref name=\"salvatvol2p56\">Rosas Volume 2, p.5\u20136.</ref> The production of these ceramic figures, which would later include animals and other forms, remained an important art form for 2000 years.

In the Mayan areas, the art disappears in the late pre-Classic, to reappear in the Classic, mostly in the form of whistles and other musical instruments. In a few areas, such as parts of Veracruz, the creation of ceramic figures continued uninterrupted until the Spanish conquest, but as a handcraft, not a formal art.<ref name=\"salvatvol2p67\">Rosas Volume 2, p.6-7.</ref>\n\n[[File:Messico, maya, piatto da calakmul, 600-800 ca..JPG|thumb|Painted ceramic plate from [[Calakmul]], 600 to 800 AD.]]\nMesoamerican painting is found in various expressions\u2014from murals, to the creation of [[Mesoamerican codices|codices]] and the painting of ceramic objects. Evidence of painting goes back at least to 1800&nbsp;BCE and continues uninterrupted in one form or another until the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century.<ref name=\"salvatvol3p2\">Rosas Volume 3, p.2.</ref> Although it may have occurred earlier, the earliest known cases of artistic painting of monumental buildings occur in the early Classic period with the Mayas at [[Uaxactun]] and [[Tikal]], and in [[Teotihuacan]] with walls painted in various colors.<ref name=\"salvat vol 1p11\" />\n\nPaints were made from animal, vegetable and mineral pigments and bases.<ref name=\"salvatvol3p4\">Rosas Volume 3, p.4.</ref> Most paintings focus one or more human figures, which may be realistic or stylized, masculine, feminine or asexual. They may be naked or richly attired, but the social status of each figure is indicated in some way. Scenes often depict war, sacrifice, the roles of the gods or the acts of nobles. However, some common scenes with common people have been found as well.<ref name=\"salvatvol3p5\">Rosas Volume 3, p.5.</ref> Other subjects included gods, symbols and animals.<ref name=\"salvatvol3p4\" /> Mesoamerican painting was bi-dimensional with no efforts to create the illusion of depth. However, movement is often represented.<ref name=\"salvatvol3p7\">Rosas Volume 3, p.7.</ref>\n\nNon-ceramic sculpture in Mesoamerica began with the modification of animal bones, with the oldest known piece being an animal skull from [[Tequixquiac]] that dates between 10,000 and 8,000&nbsp;BCE.<ref name=\"salvatvol2p56\" /> Most Mesoamerican sculpture is of stone; while relief work on buildings is the most dominant, freestanding sculpture was done as well. Freestanding three-dimensional stone sculpture began with the Olmecs, with the most famous example being the [[Olmec#Colossal heads|giant Olmec stone heads]]. This disappeared for the rest of the Mesoamerican period in favor of relief work until the late post-Classic with the [[Aztec]]s.<ref>Rosas Volume 3, p.12.</ref>\n\n[[File:CoyolxauhquiDisk cropped.JPG|thumb|A disk depicting the goddess [[Coyolxauhqui]], 14th to 16th century, at the [[Templo Mayor]] museum.]]\nThe majority of stonework during the Mesoamerican period is associated with monumental architecture that, along with mural painting, was considered an integral part of architecture rather than separate.<ref name=\"salvatvol1p15\">Rosas Volume 1, p.15.</ref> Monumental architecture began with the Olmecs in southern [[Veracruz]] and the coastal area of [[Tabasco]] in places such as San Lorenzo; large temples on pyramid bases can still be seen in sites such as Montenegro, [[Chiapa de Corzo (Mesoamerican site)|Chiapa de Corzo]] and [[La Venta]]. This practice spread to the [[Oaxaca]] area and the [[Valley of Mexico]], appearing in cities such as [[Monte Alb\u00e1n]], [[Cuicuilco]] and [[Teotihuacan]].<ref name=\"salvat vol 1p11\" /><ref name=\"salvatvol1p18\">Rosas Volume 1, p.18.</ref>\n\n[[File:Feather_headdress_Moctezuma_II.JPG|thumb|left|[[Montezuma's headdress]]. It is now in the [[Museum of Ethnology, Vienna]], and is a source of dispute between [[Austria]] and [[Mexico]], as no similar pieces remain in Mexico.]]\n\nThese cities had a nucleus of one or more plazas, with temples, palaces and [[Mesoamerican ball court]]s. Alignment of these structures was based on the cardinal directions and astronomy for ceremonial purposes, such as focusing the sun's rays during the spring equinox on a sculpted or painted image. This was generally tied to calendar systems.<ref name=\"salvatvol1p2023\">Rosas Volume 1, p.20-23.</ref> Relief sculpture and/or painting were created as the structures were built. By the latter pre-Classic, almost all monumental structures in Mesoamerica had extensive relief work. Some of the best examples of this are Monte Alb\u00e1n, Teotihuacan and [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]].<ref name=\"salvatvol2p5\">Rosas Volume 2, p.5.</ref>\n\nPre-Hispanic reliefs are general lineal in design and low, medium and high reliefs can be found. While this technique is often favored for narrative scenes elsewhere in the world, Mesoamerican reliefs tend to focus on a single figure. The only time reliefs are used in the narrative sense is when several relief steles are placed together. The best relief work is from the Mayas, especially from [[Yaxchilan]].<ref name=\"salvatvol2p4\">Rosas Volume 2, p.4.</ref>\n\nWriting and art were not distinct as they have been for European cultures.

They relied on indigenous stonemasons and sculptors to build churches and other Christian structures, often in the same places as temples and shrines of the traditional religion. \"Although some Indians complained about the burden such labor represented, most communities considered a large and impressive church to be a reflection of their town's importance and took justifiable pride in creating a sacred place for divine worship.\"<ref>Ida Altman, Sarah Cline, Javier Pescador, ''The Early History of Greater Mexico''.

An important early manuscript that was commissioned for the Spanish crown was [[Codex Mendoza]], named after the first viceroy of Mexico, Don [[Antonio de Mendoza]], which shows the tribute delivered to the Aztec ruler from individual towns as well as descriptions of proper comportment for the common people. A far more elaborate project utilizing indigenous scribes illustration is the project resulting in the [[Florentine Codex]] directed by Franciscan [[Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan]].  Other indigenous manuscripts in the colonial era include the [[Huexotzinco Codex]] and Codex Osuna.\n\nAn important type of manuscript from the early period were pictorial and textual histories of the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs from the indigenous viewpoint.  The early [[Lienzo de Tlaxcala]] illustrated the contributions the Spaniards' Tlaxcalan allies made to the defeat of the Aztec Empire, as well the [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] and his cultural translator Do\u00f1a Marina ([[Malinche]]).\n\n'''Painting''' Most Nahua artists producing this visual art are anonymous.  An exception is the work of Juan Gerson, who ca. 1560 decorated the vault of the Franciscan church in the Nahua town of Tecamachalco,(Puebla state), with individual scenes from the Old Testament.<ref>Schrefler, \"Visual Arts\", p.1556.</ref>\n\nWhile colonial art remained almost completely European in style, with muted colors and no indication of movement\u2014the addition of native elements, which began with the ''tequitqui,'' continued.

This included mendicant friars, such as Fray Alonso L\u00f3pez de Herrera. Later, most artists were born in Mexico, but trained in European techniques, often from imported engravings. This dependence on imported copies meant that Mexican works preserved styles after they had gone out of fashion in Europe.<ref name=\"jflam\" /> In the colonial period, artists worked in guilds, not independently.

Self-portrait]]\nBaroque painting became firmly established in Mexico by the middle of the 17th century with the work of Spaniard Sebasti\u00e1n L\u00f3pez de Arteaga. His painting is exemplified by the canvas called ''Doubting Thomas'' from 1643. In this work, the [[Apostle Thomas]] is shown inserting his finger in the wound in Christ's side to emphasize Christ's suffering. The caption below reads \"the Word made flesh\" and is an example of Baroque's didactic purpose.<ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nOne difference between painters in Mexico and their European counterparts is that they preferred realistic directness and clarity over fantastic colors, elongated proportions and extreme spatial relationships. The goal was to create a realistic scene in which the viewer could imagine himself a part of. This was a style created by [[Caravaggio]] in Italy, which became popular with artists in [[Seville]], from which many migrants came to New Spain came.<ref name=\"Britannica\" /> Similarly, Baroque free standing sculptures feature life-size scales, realistic skin tones and the simulation of gold-threaded garments through a technique called ''estofado'', the application of paint over gold leaf.<ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\n[[File:Vista de la Fachada del Templo de San Francisco Acatepec 9.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Church of San Francisco Acatepec]] with Baroque Talavera tiling]]\nThe most important later influence to Mexican and other painters in Latin America was the work of Flemish artist [[Peter Paul Rubens]], known through copies made from engravings and [[mezzotint]] techniques. His paintings were copied and reworked and became the standard for both religious and secular art.<ref name=\"Britannica\" /> Later Baroque paintings moved from the confines of altarpieces to colossal freestanding canvases on church interiors. One of the best known Mexican painters of this kind of work was [[Crist\u00f3bal de Villalpando]]. His work can be seen in the [[sacristy]] of the Mexico City Cathedral, which was done between 1684 and 1686. These canvases were glued directly onto the walls with arched frames to stabilize them, and placed just under the vaults of the ceiling. Even the fresco work of the 16th century was not usually this large.<ref name=\"Britannica\" /> Another one of Villalpando's works is the cupola of the [[Puebla Cathedral]] in 1688. He used Rubens' brush techniques and the shape of the structure to create a composition of clouds with angels and saints, from which a dove descends to represent the Holy Spirit. The light from the cupola's windows is meant to symbolize God's grace.<ref name=\"Britannica\" /> [[Juan Rodr\u00edguez Ju\u00e1rez]] (1675\u20131728) and mulatto artist [[Juan Correa]] (1646\u20131716) were also prominent painters of the baroque era. Correa's most famous student, [[Jos\u00e9 de Ibarra]] (1685\u20131756), was also mixed-race.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} One of Mexico's finest painters, [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]] (1695\u20131768), was likely mixed race.<ref>Ilona Katzew, \"Valiant Styles: New Spanish Painting, 1700\u201385\" in ''Painting in Latin America, 1550\u20131820'', Luisa Elena Alcal\u00e1 and Jonathan Brown, eds.

In a society characterized by a deep religious feeling which was imbued, it is not surprising that many portraits reflected the moral virtues and piety of the model.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.retratos.org/pdfs/TRG_121504b.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305145806/http://www.retratos.org/pdfs/TRG_121504b.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-05 }}</ref>\n\nWhile most commissioned art was for churches, secular works were commissioned as well. Portrait painting was known relatively early in the colonial period, mostly of viceroys and archbishops, as well as the conqueror [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]]. Portraits of royal and ecclesiastical officials were an approximation of the sitter's appearance, and were displayed in their official settings. They often included their coats of arms.  In the sixteenth-century portrait of Cort\u00e9s, the conqueror is portrayed with a baton, sword, and armor \"symbolize political and military might, but the discarded glove helmet and glove reveal that his warring activities are completed.\"<ref>Donahue-Wallace, p. 204.</ref> Portraits of viceroys and ecclesiastics were often portrayed in rich clothing and writing implements, along with their coats of arms indicating their genealogy and high standing as well as books and writing implements. In Mexico, there are few exemplars of royal officials from before the eighteenth century, perhaps because the 1696 riot destroyed the portrait gallery in the viceregal palace.<ref>Donahue-Wallace, ''Art and Architecture of Viceregal Latin America'', p. 201, 204.</ref>\n\nBeginning in the late seventeenth century, portrait painting of local elites became a significant genre. Especially important is that women were portrayed for the first time, starting in the eighteenth century. These works followed European models, with symbols of rank and titles either displayed unattached in the outer portions or worked into another element of the paintings such as curtains.<ref name=\"Britannica\" /> Elite women were dressed in rich embroidered and embellished dresses, usually of silk and lace, with jewelry and other adornment. Many were painted with fans in their hands. Unlike their male counterparts in elite society showing their status and authority, portraits of women were idealized images of womanhood with symbols of femininity.<ref>Donahue-Wallace, p. 205</ref> A subset of their genre were portraits of nuns when they first professed, dressed in elaborate clothing appropriate for the solemn step they were taking in entering the convent. A notable example is by [[Jos\u00e9 de Alc\u00edbar]] of Sor (sister) Mar\u00eda Ignacia de la Sangre de Cristo, with a ceremonial crown, embroidered robes, and other accoutrements.  Miguel Cabrera's posthumous portrait of Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz, famous in her own time, in her convent cell surrounded by books, is different from most nun's portraits, painted from life or immediately postmortem.  There are also a number of postmortem portraits of nuns.\n\nThere are quite a number of family group portraits with a religious devotional theme, commissioned to show the family's piety, but also as way to display the family's wealth.  Josep Antonio de Ayala was a prominent artist, who is known for painting \"The family of the Valley at the foot of [[Our Lady of Loreto]]\" (c. 1769). This devotional painting was commissioned for the children of the del Valle family in memory of his parents and is characteristic of the painting of this century.<ref>{{cite book|title=Seis Siglos de Arte, Cien Grandes Maestros de Romero|editor-last=de Romero|editor-first=Soumaya Slim|editor-first2=Minerva Mogollan|editor-last2=Garcia|editor-first3=Eva Maria|editor-last3=Ayala Canseco|publisher=Fundacion Carso / Museo Soumaya|year=2006|isbn=9789687794303}}</ref> The Virgin of Loreto is central to the composition, with the stiff figures of the family members are finely dressed.  The men are in fashionable clothing of the era, with the matriarch of the family wearing an embroidered and lace dress, along with pearls. The daughters are shown in the habit of Conceptionist nuns, with ''escudos de monjas'', religious paintings worn on their chests.  The painting is inscribed with in information about its commission and the parents, and the fact that it hung in chapel of the family's hacienda.  The painting is a display of piety and wealth. There are such group paintings with different central religious figures.<ref>Donahue-Wallace, p. 207.</ref>\n\nTwo notable portrait painters are brothers in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century are [[Juan Rodr\u00edguez Ju\u00e1rez]] and [[Nicol\u00e1s Rodr\u00edguez Ju\u00e1rez|Nicol\u00e1s]].

Some were likely commissioned by Spanish functionaries as souvenirs of Mexico. A number of artists of the era created casta paintings, including [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]], [[Jos\u00e9 de Ibarra]], [[Juan Patricio Morlete Ruiz]], [[Francisco Clapera]], and [[Luis de Mena]], but most casta paintings are unsigned. Ibarra, Morlete, and possibly Cabrera were of mixed race and born outside Mexico City.<ref>Ilona Katzew, \"Valiant Styles: New Spanish Painting, 1700-85\" in ''Painting in Latin America, 1550\u20131820'', Luisa Elena Alcal\u00e1 and Jonathan Brown.

It is one of the most-reproduced examples of casta paintings, one of the small number that show the casta system on a single canvas rather than up to 16 separate paintings. It is unique in uniting the thoroughly secular genre of casta painting with a depiction of the Virgin of Guadalupe.<ref>Sarah Cline, \"Guadalupe and the Castas: The Power of a Singular Colonial Mexican Painting\", ''Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos'', Vol. 31, Issue 2, Summer 2015, pages 218\u2013246.</ref> Production of these paintings stopped after the 1821 conclusion of the [[Mexican War of Independence]], when legal racial categories were repudiated in independent Mexico. Until the run-up to the 500th anniversary of the Columbus's 1492 voyage, casta paintings were of little or no interest, even to art historians, but scholars began systematically studying them as a genre.<ref>Cline, \"Guadalupe and the Castas\", p. 221.</ref><ref>Ilona Katzew.

Large and meant for display in public and private rooms of elite homes, they had a variety of subject matter, ranging from paintings of historical events, real or imagined, allegorical presentations, and scenes from everyday life in Mexico.  Mexico was a crossroads of trade in the colonial period, with goods from Asia and Europe mixing with those locally produced. This convergence is most evident in the decorative arts of New Spain.<ref name=\"dwarren\" /> It was popular among the upper classes to have a main public room, called a ''salon de estrado'', to be covered in rugs and cushions for women to recline in Moorish fashion. Stools and later chairs and settees were added for men.  Starting in the seventeenth century when the [[Manila Galleon]] sailed regularly from the [[Philippines]] to the Pacific port of [[Acapulco]], folding screens or ''biombos'' (from the Japanese ''byo-bu'' or \"protection from wind\") were among the luxury goods brought from Asia. They are known to have been brought by 1610 and were subsequently produced by Mexican artists and artisans in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. They were fashionable Mexican elites at the highest level and some were shipped to Europe.  Most appear to have been produced locally in Mexico.\n\n[[Juan Correa]] produced several in the late seventeenth century, one of the 1519 meeting of [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] and [[Moctezuma II|Moctezuma]], which might have depicted more current events of an traditional Indian dance (''mitote'') performed on feast of Corpus Christi, symbolizing indigenous submission to Spanish rule and Christianity. Cort\u00e9s is presented as \"both a secular and religious hero\" while Moctezuma on a ceremonial litter has \"the trappings of a Roman emperor,\" depicting a meeting of equals.<ref>Oles, ''Art and Architecture in Mexico'', p. 85.</ref> Another was allegorical, entitled ''The Four Continents'' (ca. 1683), showing Europe, America, Asia and Africa with Europe and Asia at the center, and America and Africa at either end.<ref>Oles, ''Art and Architecture in Mexico'', pp. 80-81.</ref><ref>Donohue-Wallace, ''Art and Architecture of Viceregal Latin America'', pp. 211-217.</ref> The earliest of these Mexican made screens had oriental designs but later ones had European and Mexican themes. One example of this is a screen by an anonymous artist with the conquest of Mexico one side and an aerial view of central Mexico City's streets and buildings, but no people, on the other, now at the [[Franz Mayer Museum]].<ref name=\"dwarren\" /> Another is a local scene of an Indian wedding, with ''voladores'' (\"flyers\") suspended by ropes on their feet.\n\n====Gallery====\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Large_screen_of_the_Palace_of_the_Viceroys_of_Mexico,_ca._1676-1700,_Mexico_City,_Museum_of_the_Americas,_anonimous_painter.jpg|Large screen of the Palace of the Viceroys of Mexico, ca. 1676-1700, Mexico City, Museum of the Americas\nFile:ScreenConquest17Cent01.jpg|A [[Folding screen|Biombo screen]] with a depiction of the Spanish conquest of Mexico at the [[Franz Mayer Museum]]\nFile:Los Cuatro Elementos - Juan Correa.jpg|[[Juan Correa]], ''The liberal arts and the four elements'' (Las artes liberales y los cuatro elementos). 1670\nFile:Folding Screen with Indian Wedding and Flying Pole (Biombo con desposorio ind\u00edgena y palo volador) - Google Art Project.jpg|Folding Screen with Indian Wedding and [[Danza de los Voladores|Voladores]], ca. 1690\nDisplayRoomFranzMayer.jpg|One of the display areas in the Franz Mayer Museum in Mexico City\nDisplayroomFranzMayerDF.jpg|One of the display areas in the Franz Mayer Museum in Mexico City\n</gallery>\n\n===The Academy of San Carlos===\n{{Main|Academy of San Carlos}}\n[[File:Rafael Ximeno y Planes - Portrait of Manuel Tols\u00e1 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of [[Manuel Tols\u00e1]], architect and director of the [[Academy of San Carlos]] by [[Rafael Ximeno y Planes]], director of painting at the Academy]]\nThe last colonial era art institution established was the [[Academy of San Carlos]] in 1783.<ref name=\"statesponsored\">{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253329 |title=State sponsored art |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}</ref> While the depiction of saints consumed most artistic efforts, they were not without political effects.

This style was a reinterpretation of Greco-Roman references and its use was a way to reinforce European dominance in the Spain's colonies. One Neoclassical artist from the Academy at the end of the colonial period was [[Manuel Tols\u00e1]]. He first taught sculpture at the [[Academy of San Carlos]] and then became its second director. Tols\u00e1 designed a number of [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical buildings]] in Mexico but his best known work is an equestrian status of King Charles IV in bronze cast in 1803 and originally placed in the [[Z\u00f3calo]]. As of 2011 it can be seen at the [[Museo Nacional de Arte]].<ref name=\"statesponsored\" />\n\nBy the late 18th century, Spain's colonies were becoming culturally independent from Spain, including its arts. The Academy was established by the [[Spanish Crown]] to regain control of artistic expression and the messages it disseminated. This school was staffed by Spanish artists in each of the major disciplines, with the first director being Antonio Gil.<ref name=\"statesponsored\" /> The school became home to a number of plaster casts of classic statues from the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando|San Fernando Fine Arts Academy]] in Spain, brought there for teaching purposes.

The new government continued to favor [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] as it considered the [[Baroque]] a symbol of colonialism.

However, indigenous themes appeared in paintings and sculptures. One indigenous figure depicted in Neoclassical style is Tlahuicol, done by [[Catalan people|Catalan]] artist [[:es:Manuel Vilar|Manuel Vilar]] in 1851.\n\nThere were two reasons for this shift in preferred subject. The first was that Mexican society denigrated colonial culture\u2014the indigenous past was seen as more truly Mexican.<ref name=\"dwarren\" /> The other factor was a worldwide movement among artists to confront society, which began around 1830. In Mexico, this anti-establishment sentiment was directed at the Academy of San Carlos and its European focus.<ref name=\"pazp2\">Paz, 1987 p.2.</ref>\n\nIn the first half of the 19th century, the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] style of painting was introduced into Mexico and the rest of Latin America by foreign travelers interested in the newly independent country. One of these was [[Bavaria]]n artist [[Johann Moritz Rugendas]], who lived in the country from 1831 to 1834. He painted scenes with dynamic composition and bright colors in accordance with Romantic style, looking for striking, sublime, and beautiful images in Mexico as well as other areas of Latin America. However much of Rugendas's works are sketches for major canvases, many of which were never executed. Others include Englishman [[Daniel Thomas Egerton|Daniel Egerton]], who painted landscapes in the British Romantic tradition, and German [[Carl Nebel]], who primarily created [[lithograph]]s of the various social and ethnic populations of the country.<ref name=\"foreigntravel\">{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253334 |title=Foreign Travelers |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nA number of native-born artists at the time followed the European Romantic painters in their desire to document the various cultures of Mexico. These painters were called ''[[Costumbrismo|costumbristas]]'', a word deriving from ''costumbre'' (custom). The styles of these painters were not always strictly Romantic, involving other styles as well. Most of these painters were from the upper classes and educated in Europe. While the European painters viewed subjects as exotic, the costumbristas had a more nationalistic sense of their home countries. One of these painters was [[Agust\u00edn Arrieta]] from Puebla, who applied realistic techniques to scenes from his home city, capturing its brightly painted tiles and ceramics. His scenes often involved everyday life such as women working in kitchen and depicted black and Afro-Mexican vendors.<ref name=\"costumbristas\">{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253335 |title=Costumbristas |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n====Gallery====\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Entrada del Generalisimo Don Agustin de Iturbide a Mexico.jpg|Entrance of [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]] to Mexico City in 1821.

Dr Atl was born \"Gerard Murillo\" in [[Guadalajara, Mexico|Guadalajara]] in 1875. He changed his name in order to identify himself as Mexican. Atl worked to promote [[Mexican handcrafts and folk art|Mexico's folk art and handcrafts]]. While he had some success as a painter in Guadalajara, his radical ideas against academia and the government prompted him to move to more liberal Mexico City. In 1910, months before the start of the [[Mexican Revolution]], Atl painted the first modern mural in Mexico. He taught major artists to follow him, including those who came to dominate Mexican mural painting.<ref name=\"tburton\" />\n\nThe muralist movement reached its height in the 1930s with four main protagonists: [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], [[Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco]], and Fernando Leal.

The main goal in many of these paintings was the glorification of Mexico's pre-Hispanic past as a definition of Mexican identity.<ref name=\"jcummings\" /> They had success in both Mexico and the United States, which brought them fame and wealth as well as Mexican and American students.<ref name=\"pazp24\" />\n\n[[File:The_Kid_-_Diego_Rivera.jpg|thumb|left|Mural [[Sue\u00f1o de una Tarde Dominical en la Alameda Central]] in Mexico City, featuring Rivera and Frida Kahlo standing by La Calavera Catrina.]]\n\nThese muralists revived the fresco technique for their mural work, although Siqueiros moved to industrial techniques and materials such as the application of [[pyroxilin]], a commercial enamel used for airplanes and automobiles.<ref name=\"jcummings\" /> One of Rivera's earliest mural efforts emblazoned the courtyard of the Ministry of Education with a series of dancing tehuanas (natives of [[Tehuantepec]] in southern Mexico).

Having suffered a crippling bus accident earlier in her teenage life, she began to challenge Mexico's obsession with the female body. Her portraits, purposefully small, addressed a wide range of topics not being addressed by the mainstream art world at the time. These included motherhood, domestic violence, and male egoism.\n\nHer paintings never had subjects wearing lavish jewelry or fancy clothes like those found in muralist paintings. Instead, she would sparsely dress herself up, and when there were accessories, it added that much more importance to them. She would also depict herself in very surreal, unsettling scenarios like in ''[[The Two Fridas]]'' where she depicts two versions of herself, one with a broken heart and one with a healthy infusing the broken heart with \"hopeful\" blood., or Henry Ford Hospital where she depicts herself in having an abortion and the struggle she had in real life coming to terms with it.\n\nAlthough she was the wife of Diego Rivera, her self-portraits stayed rather obscured from the public eye until well after her passing in 1954.  Her art has grown in popularity and she is seen by many to be one of the earliest and most influential feminist artists of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite book|last=Meade |first=Teresa |title=The History of Modern Latin America |year=2016 |pages=192\u2013193}}</ref>\n\n=====Gallery=====\n<gallery>\nFile:Hidalgo de Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco.JPG|[[Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco]], [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]], Jalisco Governmental Palace, Guadalajara\nFile:LaTrincheraOrozcoSICDF.JPG|[[Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco]], ''The Trench'' [[San Ildefonso College]], Mexico City\nFile:Murales Rivera - Markt in Tlatelolco 3.jpg|[[Diego Rivera]] ''Tenochtitlan'', [[National Palace (Mexico)|Palacio Nacional]], Mexico City.\nFile:RiveraMuralNationalPalace.jpg|[[Diego Rivera]] Mural in the main stairwell of the National Palace\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: File:Rivera-the-arsenal.jpg|[[Diego Rivera]] ''The Arsenal'' detail, 1928 -->\nFile:Mural David Alfaro Siqueiros en el Tecpan Tlatelolco.jpg|[[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], Mural at Tecpan\nFile:EagleSnakeMexicoCharlotSICDF.JPG|[[Jean Charlot]], Eagle and snake, [[San Ildefonso College]]\nFile:Mural_-_nopal.jpg|Part of the mural [[Presencia de Am\u00e9rica Latina]] by [[Jorge Gonz\u00e1lez Camarena]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Other Artistic Expressions 1920\u20131950===\n{{See also|Museo Casa Chihuahua}}\n[[File:HoyTamayoBADF.JPG|thumb|''Mexico de Hoy'' by Rufino Tamayo on the first floor of the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]]]]\nThe first to break with the nationalistic and political tone of the muralist movement was [[Rufino Tamayo]].

These films featured archetypal star figures and symbols based on broad national mythologies. Some of the mythology according to [[Carlos Monsiv\u00e1is]], includes the participants in family melodramas, the masculine ''[[charro]]s'' of ranchero films, [[femme fatale]]s (often played by [[Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix]] and [[Dolores del R\u00edo]]), the indigenous peoples of [[Emilio Fern\u00e1ndez]]'s films, and [[Cantinflas]]'s ''peladito'' (urban miscreant).<ref name=\"strayer\" />\n\nSettings were often [[ranches]], the battlefields of the [[Mexican Revolution|revolution]], and [[cabaret]]s.

The first was a generation of talented actors and filmmakers. These included actors such as [[Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix]], [[Jorge Negrete]], [[Pedro Armend\u00e1riz]], [[Pedro Infante]], [[Cantinflas]], and directors such as [[Emilio Fern\u00e1ndez|Emilio \"El Indio\" Fernandez]] and cinematographer [[Gabriel Figueroa]].

Much of the production during the Golden Age was financed with a mix of public and private money, with the government eventually taking a larger role. In 1942 the Banco Cinematogr\u00e1fico financed almost all of the industry, coming under government control by 1947. This gave the government extensive censorship rights through deciding which projects to finance.<ref name=\"strayer\" /> While the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) censored films in many ways in the 1940s and 1950s, it was not as repressive as other Spanish speaking countries, but it played a strong role in how Mexico's government and culture was portrayed.<ref name=\"strayer\" /><ref name=\"roads\" />\n\nThe Golden Age ended in the late 1950s, with the 1960s dominated by poorly made imitations of Hollywood westerns and comedies. These films were increasingly shot outdoors and popular films featured stars from [[lucha libre]]. Art and experimental film production in Mexico has its roots in the same period, which began to bear fruit in the 1970s.<ref name=\"truax\" /><ref name=\"roads\" /> Director [[Paul Leduc (film director)|Paul Leduc]] surfaced in the 1970s, specializing in films without dialogue. His first major success was with ''[[Reed: Insurgent Mexico]]'' (1971) followed by a biography of [[Frida Kahlo]] called ''Frida'' (1984). He is the most consistently political of modern Mexican directors. In the 1990s, he filmed ''Latino Bar'' (1991) and ''Dollar Mambo'' (1993). His silent films generally have not had commercial success.<ref name=\"roads\" />\n\n[[File:Amores-perros-logo.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.13|''[[Amores perros]]'' won 11 [[Ariel Award]]s and the 2001 [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language]].]]\n\nIn the late 20th century the main proponent of Mexican art cinema was [[Arturo Ripstein|Arturo Ripstein Jr.]]. His career began with a spaghetti Western-like film called ''Tiempo de morir'' in 1965 and who some consider the successor to [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]] who worked in Mexico in the 1940s. Some of his classic films include ''[[The Castle of Purity|El Castillo de la pureza]]'' (1973), ''[[The Place Without Limits|Lugar sin limites]]'' (1977) and ''[[The Queen of the Night|La reina de la noche]]'' (1994) exploring topics such as family ties and even homosexuality, dealing in cruelty, irony, and tragedy.<ref name=\"roads\" />\nState censorship was relatively lax in the 1960s and early 1970s, but came back during the latter 1970s and 1980s, monopolizing production and distribution.<ref name=\"truax\" />\n\n[[File:Fantasy_Worlds_of_Myth_and_Magic,_EMP,_Seattle_(15388051142).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.13|Faun face from [[Pan's Labyrinth]] displayed at Fantasy: Worlds of Myth and Magic, Experience Music Project/Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Seattle.

One reason for international interest in Mexican cinema was the wild success of the 1992 film [[Like Water for Chocolate (film)|''Como Agua Para Chocolate'']] (''Like Water for Chocolate'').<ref name=\"truax\" /><ref name=\"roads\" /> In 1993, this film was the largest grossing foreign language film in U.S. history and ran in a total of 34 countries.<ref name=\"macdonald\" /> Since then, Mexican film divided into two genres. Those for a more domestic audience tend to be more personal and more ambiguously political such as ''Pueblo de Madera'', ''La Vida Conjugal'', and ''Angel de fuego''. Those geared for international audiences have more stereotypical Mexican images and include ''[[S\u00f3lo con Tu Pareja]]'', ''[[Cronos (film)|La Invencion de Cronos]]'' along with ''Como Agua para Chocolate''.<ref name=\"macdonald\" /><ref name=\"roads\" />\n\nMexico's newest generation of successful directors includes [[Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu]], [[Guillermo del Toro]], and [[Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n]] known as \"The Three Amigos of Cinema\". Films by this directors include Cuar\u00f3n's ''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]'', del Toro's ''[[The Shape of Water]]'' and I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's ''[[Birdman (film)|Birdman]]''.

It dates to the [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]] period of rule, or the ''Porfiriato'', from the late 19th century to 1910.<ref name=\"mexconnect\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1086-the-legacy-of-agustin-victor-casasola-photographer-1874-1938 |title= The legacy of Agustin Victor Casasola (Photographer 1874\u20131938) |last=Pomade |first=Rita |date=June 1, 2004 |publisher=Mexconnect |issn= 1028-9089 |accessdate=29 November 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"cuevaswolfp7\">Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.7.</ref> Porfirian-era photography was heavily inclined toward the presentation of the nation's modernization to the rest of the world, with Mexico City as its cultural showpiece.

Like Kahlo, he began his career in the Porfirato, but his career was focused on photography for periodicals. Again like Kahlo, Casasola's work prior to the Mexican Revolution focused on non-controversial photographs, focusing on the lives of the elite. The outbreak of civil war caused Casasola's choice of subject to change. He began to focus not only on portraits of the main protagonists (such as [[Francisco Villa]]) and general battle scenes, but on executions and the dead. He focused on people whose faces showed such expressions as pain, kindness, and resignation.<ref name=\"mexconnect\" />\n\nHis work during this time produced a large collection of photographs, many of which are familiar to Mexicans as they have been widely reprinted and reused, often without credit to Casasola. After the war, Casasola continued to photograph common people, especially migrants to Mexico City during the 1920s and 1930s. His total known archives comprise about half a million images with many of his works archived in the former monastery of San Francisco in [[Pachuca]].<ref name=\"mexconnect\" />\n\n[[File:Decena tr\u00e1gica.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.13|A scene from the [[Decena Tr\u00e1gica]], February 1913, from the [[Casasola Archive]]]]\n\nKahlo and Casasola are considered the two most important photographers to develop the medium in Mexico, with Kahlo defining architectural photography and Casasolas establishing photojournalism. Neither man thought of himself as an artist\u2014especially not Casasolas\u2014who thought of himself as a historian in the [[Positivism|Positivist]] tradition, but the photography of both show attention to detail, lighting, and placement of subjects for emotional or dramatic effect.<ref name=\"cuevaswolfp9\">Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.9.</ref><ref name=\"cuevaswolfp1825\">Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.18-25.</ref>\n\nFor the rest of the 20th century, most photography was connected to documentation. However, artistic trends from both inside and outside the country had an effect. In the 1920s, the dominant photographic style was [[Pictorialism]], in which images had a romantic or dream-like quality due to the use of filters and other techniques. American [[Edward Weston]] broke with this tradition, taking these effects away for more realistic and detailed images.<ref name=\"mexconnect\" /><ref name=\"usatoday\">{{cite news |title= Edward Weston: Pictorialist Pioneer |newspaper=USA Today |date=September 27, 2003 |pages=62\u201365 s }}</ref> This caused a split in the photography world between Pictorialists and Realists both inside and outside of Mexico.<ref name=\"mexconnect\" />\n\n[[File:Villa y zapata.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.36|[[Pancho Villa]] (left) \"commander of the Divisi\u00f3n del Norte (North Division)\", and [[Emiliano Zapata]] \"''Ej\u00e9rcito Libertador del Sur'' ([[Liberation Army of the South]])\" in 1914.

Photography and other arts shifted to depictions of the country's indigenous heritage and the glorification of the Mexican common people.<ref name=\"cuevaswolfp9\" /> This was mainly to reject the elitist and heavily European values of the Porfiriato, along with the increasing cultural influence of the United States in favor of an \"authentic\" and distinct Mexican identity.<ref name=\"cuevaswolfp910\">Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.9-10.</ref> Another was the government's decision to use this imagery, rather than the still-fresh memories of the battles and atrocities of the Revolution to promote itself.<ref name=\"cuevaswolfp27\">Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.27.</ref>\n\n[[File:Modotti Frau in Tehuantepec.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.13|Woman from [[Tehuantepec]] (Mexico), photograph by [[Tina Modotti]].]]\n\nManuel Alvarez Bravo experimented with abstraction in his photography and formed his own personal style concerned with Mexican rites and customs. He was active from the 1920s until his death in the 1990s. Like other artists of the 20th century, he was concerned with balancing international artistic trends with the expression of Mexican culture and people. His photographic techniques were concerned with transforming the ordinary into the fantastic. From the end of the 1930s to the 1970s his photography developed along with new technologies such as color, using the same themes. In the 1970s, he experimented with female nudes.<ref name=\"aalonso\">{{cite news |title= Manuel Alvarez Bravo: Mexico en imagenes |first=Alejandro |last=Alonso |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=June 13, 1997 |page=14 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Manuel Alvarez Bravo: Mexico in images }}</ref>\n\nThese post-Revolution photographers influenced the generations after them, but the emphasis remained on documentary journalism, especially for newspapers. For this reason, the focus remained on social issues. This included work by [[Nacho L\u00f3pez]] and [[H\u00e9ctor Garc\u00eda Cobos|Hector Garcia]], best known for their photography of the [[Tlatelolco massacre|student uprising of 1968]].<ref name=\"monroy\" />\n\n[[File:Ex\u00e8rcit_al_Z\u00f3calo-28_d'agost.jpg|thumb|right|The \"Z\u00f3calo\" in Mexico City in 1968]]\n\nDuring the 1970s, a fusion of various styles retained a social focus.<ref name=\"monroy\" /> During the same period, institutions were established that dedicated themselves to the promotion of photography and conservation of photographs, such as the Centro de la Imagen, the Fototeca Nacional del [[INAH]], and the publication ''Luna C\u00f3rnea''.<ref name=\"grandes\">{{cite news |title= Los 13 grandes de la fotograf\u00eda mexicana |first=Yanet |last=Aguilar Sosa |url= http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/sociedad/3014.html |newspaper=El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=May 20, 2009 |accessdate=November 30, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The 13 greats of Mexican photography }}</ref>\n\nPhotography in Mexico from the latter 20th century on remains mostly focused on photojournalism and other kinds of documentary. Francisco Mata de Rosas is considered the most notable photographer in contemporary Mexico mostly working with documentaries.{{according to whom|date=January 2012}} He has published a number of books including ''M\u00e9xico Tenochtitlan'' and ''Tepito, Bravo el Barrio''. Eniac Mart\u00ednez specializes in panoramas. Patricia Aridjis works with social themes, mostly to illustrate books. Gerardo Montiel Klint's work has been described as a \"shadowing and dark world\", focusing on the angst and violence of adolescents.<ref name=\"grandes\" /> The most recent generation of photographers work with new and digital technologies. One of these is [[Javier Orozco]] who specializes in interiors.<ref name=\"monroy\" />\n\nHowever, purely artistic photography has had an impact. In 2002, a photographic exhibit by [[Daniela Rossell]] featured images of Mexican multimillionaires posing in their ostentatious homes, filled with expensive paintings, hunting trophies, crystal chandeliers, gold lam\u00e9 wallpaper, and household help. The photographs set off a wave of social criticism as well as tabloid gossip.<ref name=\"rgallop47\">Gallo, 2004 p.47.</ref>\n\n=== Gallery ===\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Piedra del sol Porfirio Diaz.png|[[Porfirio D\u00edaz]] with the [[Piedra del Sol]], photographer not known\nFile:Emiliano Zapata-Libreria del Congreso.jpg|General [[Emiliano Zapata]], leader of revolutionaries in Morelos beginning in 1911 and ending in his assassination in 1919<ref>Archivo General de la Naci\u00f3n, Mexico City, Archivo Fotogr\u00e1fico D\u00edaz, Delgado y Garc\u00eda.</ref>\nFile:David Alfaro Siqueiros (El Coronelazo).jpg|Siqueiros by [[H\u00e9ctor Garc\u00eda Cobo]] at Lecumberri prison, Mexico City, 1960.\nFile:Ni\u00f1o Soldado.jpg|Boy soldier during the [[Mexican Revolution]], [[Casasola Archive]].<ref>Photograph by Antonio Gomes Delgado ''El Negro'', Casasola Archive, Mexico</ref>\nFile:Centro-fotografico-in-oaxaca-founded-by-toledo.jpg|[[Centro Fotogr\u00e1fico \u00c1lvarez Bravo]] at the [[Institute of Graphic Arts of Oaxaca]].\nFile:0000-1938-DESFILE DEL 16 DE SEPTIEMBRE (2) (38866081012).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.13|Photo of the Independence Day parade (September 16) in Mexico City at the [[Museo Archivo de la Fotograf\u00eda]] (Museum of the Photographic Archive).\nFile:UNAMBiblioteca1974.jpg|[[National Autonomous University of Mexico|National Autonomous University]], Mexico City.

The development of these arts roughly follows the [[history of Mexico]], divided into the prehispanic [[Mesoamerican]] era, the [[New Spain|colonial period]], with the period after [[Mexican War of Independence]], the development Mexican national identity through art in the nineteenth century, and the florescence of modern '''Mexican art''' after the [[Mexican Revolution]] (1910-1920).\n\nMesoamerican art is that produced in an area that encompasses much of what is now central and southern Mexico, before the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]] for a period of about 3,000 years from Mexican Art can be bright and colourful this is called encopended. During this time, all influences on art production were indigenous, with art heavily tied to religion and the ruling class. There was little to no real distinction among art, architecture, and writing. The Spanish conquest led to 300 years of Spanish colonial rule, and art production remained tied to religion\u2014most art was associated with the construction and decoration of churches, but secular art expanded in the eighteenth century, particularly [[casta]] paintings, portraiture, and history painting. Almost all art produced was in the European tradition, with late colonial-era artists trained at the [[Academy of San Carlos]], but indigenous elements remained, beginning a continuous balancing act between European and indigenous traditions.<ref name=\"paz\">Paz, 1987 p.301.</ref>\n\nAfter Independence, art remained heavily European in style, but indigenous themes appeared in major works as liberal Mexico sought to distinguish itself from its Spanish colonial past. This preference for indigenous elements continued into the first half of the 20th century, with the [[Mexican muralism|Social Realism or Mexican muralist movement]] led by artists such as [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], [[Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco]], and [[Fernando Leal (artist)|Fernando Leal]], who were commissioned by the post-[[Mexican Revolution]] government to create a visual narrative of Mexican history and culture.\n\nThe strength of this artistic movement was such that it affected newly invented technologies, such as still photography and cinema, and strongly promoted popular arts and crafts as part of Mexico's identity. Since the 1950s, Mexican art has broken away from the muralist style and has been more globalized, integrating elements from Asia, with Mexican artists and filmmakers having an effect on the global stage.\n\n==Pre-Columbian art==\n{{See also|National Museum of Anthropology (Mexico)|Museo Diego Rivera Anahuacalli|Aztec codices}}\n[[File:Cavepaintings-loltun.jpg|thumb|left|Painting cave in [[Yucat\u00e1n (state)|Yucat\u00e1n]]]]\n[[File:Bonampak-7269.JPG|thumb|A Maya mural at [[Bonampak]], 8th century AD.]]\n\nIt is believed that the American continent's oldest rock art, 7500 years old, is found in a cave on the peninsula of Baja California.<ref>[http://www.elmundo.es/2002/12/12/ciencia/1292233.html Descubierta en una cueva de M\u00e9xico la pintura rupestre m\u00e1s antigua de Am\u00e9rica / EL MUNDO<!-- T\u00edtulo generado por un bot -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213061450/http://www.elmundo.es/2002/12/12/ciencia/1292233.html |date=February 13, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThe pre-Hispanic art of Mexico belongs to a cultural region known as [[Mesoamerica]], which roughly corresponds to central Mexico on into [[Central America]],<ref name=\"salvatvol1p4\">Rosas Volume 1, p.4.</ref> encompassing three thousand years from 1500 BCE to 1500 CE generally divided into three eras: Pre Classic, Classic and Post Classic.<ref name=\"salvat vol 1p11\">Rosas Volume 1, p.11.</ref> The first dominant Mesoamerican culture was that of the [[Olmec]]s, which peaked around 1200 BCE. The Olmecs originated much of what is associated with Mesoamerica, such as [[Mesoamerican writing systems|hieroglyphic writing]], [[Mesoamerican calendars|calendar]], first advances in astronomy, monumental sculpture ([[Olmec colossal heads|Olmec heads]]) and [[jade]] work.<ref name=\"pazp38\">Paz, 1987 p.38.</ref>\n\nThey were a forerunner of later cultures such as [[Teotihuacan]], north of Mexico City, the [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotecs]] in Oaxaca and the [[Mayan peoples|Mayas]] in southern Mexico, [[Belize]] and [[Guatemala]]. While empires rose and fell, the basic cultural underpinnings of the Mesoamerica stayed the same until the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]].<ref name=\"pazp38\"/> These included cities centered on plazas, temples usually built on pyramid bases, [[Mesoamerican ball court]]s and a mostly common cosmology.<ref name=\"salvatvol1p4\" />\n\n[[File:Tlatilco culture figurines.jpg|thumb|left|Female figurines from the [[Tlatilco culture]], 1250 to 800 BCE.]]\n\nWhile art forms such as cave paintings and rock etchings date from earlier, the known history of Mexican art begins with Mesoamerican art created by sedentary cultures that built cities, and often, dominions.<ref name=\"salvat vol 1p11\" /><ref name=\"pazp38\"/> While the art of Mesoamerica is more varied and extends over more time than anywhere else in the Americas, artistic styles show a number of similarities.<ref name=\"jflam\">{{cite news |title=Mexican Art Over Three Millennia |first=Jack |last=ver Flam |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |location=New York |date=October 9, 1990 |page=20}}</ref><ref name=\"salvatvol1p9\">Rosas Volume 1, p.9.</ref>\n\nUnlike modern Western art, almost all Mesoamerican art was created to serve religious or political needs, rather than art for art's sake. It is strongly based on nature, the surrounding political reality and the gods.<ref name=\"salvatvol1p12\" /> [[Octavio Paz]] states that \"Mesoamerican art is a logic of forms, lines, and volumes that is as the same time a cosmology.\" He goes on to state that this focus on space and time is highly distinct from European naturalism based on the representation of the human body. Even simple designs such as [[fretwork|stepped frets]] on buildings fall into this representation of space and time, life and the gods.<ref name=\"pazp41\">Paz, 1987 p.41.</ref>\n\n[[File:AztecSerpent.JPG|thumb|right|An aztec [[turquoise]] serpent chest ornament. At the [[British Museum]].]]\n\nArt was expressed on a variety of mediums such as ceramics, [[amate]] paper and architecture.<ref name=\"salvatvol1p9\" /> Most of what is known of Mesoamerican art comes from works that cover stone buildings and pottery, mostly paintings and reliefs.<ref name=\"jflam\" /> Ceramics date from the early the Mesoamerican period. They probably began as cooking and storage vessels but then were adapted to ritual and decorative uses. Ceramics were decorated by shaping, scratching, painting and different firing methods.<ref name=\"salvatvol1p12\">Rosas Volume 1, p.12.</ref>\n\n[[Image:TurquoiseAztecMask2.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Turquoise]] mask representing the god [[Tezcatlipoca]], from the [[British Museum]].]]\nThe earliest known purely artistic production were small ceramic figures that appeared in [[Tehuac\u00e1n, Puebla|Tehuac\u00e1n]] area around 1,500 BCE and spread to [[Veracruz]], the [[Valley of Mexico]], [[Guerrero]], [[Oaxaca]], [[Chiapas]] and the Pacific coast of Guatemala.<ref name=\"salvat vol 1p11\" /> The earliest of these are mostly female figures, probably associated with fertility rites because of their often oversized hips and thighs, as well as a number with babies in arms or nursing. When male figures appear they are most often soldiers.<ref name=\"salvatvol2p56\">Rosas Volume 2, p.5\u20136.</ref> The production of these ceramic figures, which would later include animals and other forms, remained an important art form for 2000 years. In the early Olmec period most were small but large-scale ceramic sculptures were produced as large as 55&nbsp;cm.<ref name=\"salvatvol2p2\">Rosas Volume 2, p.2.</ref><ref name=\"salvatvol2p6\">Rosas Volume 2, p.6.</ref>\n\nAfter the middle pre-Classic, ceramic sculpture declined in the center of Mexico except in the [[Chup\u00edcuaro (archaeological site)|Chup\u00edcuaro]] region. In the Mayan areas, the art disappears in the late pre-Classic, to reappear in the Classic, mostly in the form of whistles and other musical instruments. In a few areas, such as parts of Veracruz, the creation of ceramic figures continued uninterrupted until the Spanish conquest, but as a handcraft, not a formal art.<ref name=\"salvatvol2p67\">Rosas Volume 2, p.6-7.</ref>\n\n[[File:Messico, maya, piatto da calakmul, 600-800 ca..JPG|thumb|Painted ceramic plate from [[Calakmul]], 600 to 800 AD.]]\nMesoamerican painting is found in various expressions\u2014from murals, to the creation of [[Mesoamerican codices|codices]] and the painting of ceramic objects. Evidence of painting goes back at least to 1800&nbsp;BCE and continues uninterrupted in one form or another until the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century.<ref name=\"salvatvol3p2\">Rosas Volume 3, p.2.</ref> Although it may have occurred earlier, the earliest known cases of artistic painting of monumental buildings occur in the early Classic period with the Mayas at [[Uaxactun]] and [[Tikal]], and in [[Teotihuacan]] with walls painted in various colors.<ref name=\"salvat vol 1p11\" />\n\nPaints were made from animal, vegetable and mineral pigments and bases.<ref name=\"salvatvol3p4\">Rosas Volume 3, p.4.</ref> Most paintings focus one or more human figures, which may be realistic or stylized, masculine, feminine or asexual. They may be naked or richly attired, but the social status of each figure is indicated in some way. Scenes often depict war, sacrifice, the roles of the gods or the acts of nobles. However, some common scenes with common people have been found as well.<ref name=\"salvatvol3p5\">Rosas Volume 3, p.5.</ref> Other subjects included gods, symbols and animals.<ref name=\"salvatvol3p4\" /> Mesoamerican painting was bi-dimensional with no efforts to create the illusion of depth. However, movement is often represented.<ref name=\"salvatvol3p7\">Rosas Volume 3, p.7.</ref>\n\nNon-ceramic sculpture in Mesoamerica began with the modification of animal bones, with the oldest known piece being an animal skull from [[Tequixquiac]] that dates between 10,000 and 8,000&nbsp;BCE.<ref name=\"salvatvol2p56\" /> Most Mesoamerican sculpture is of stone; while relief work on buildings is the most dominant, freestanding sculpture was done as well. Freestanding three-dimensional stone sculpture began with the Olmecs, with the most famous example being the [[Olmec#Colossal heads|giant Olmec stone heads]]. This disappeared for the rest of the Mesoamerican period in favor of relief work until the late post-Classic with the [[Aztec]]s.<ref>Rosas Volume 3, p.12.</ref>\n\n[[File:CoyolxauhquiDisk cropped.JPG|thumb|A disk depicting the goddess [[Coyolxauhqui]], 14th to 16th century, at the [[Templo Mayor]] museum.]]\nThe majority of stonework during the Mesoamerican period is associated with monumental architecture that, along with mural painting, was considered an integral part of architecture rather than separate.<ref name=\"salvatvol1p15\">Rosas Volume 1, p.15.</ref> Monumental architecture began with the Olmecs in southern [[Veracruz]] and the coastal area of [[Tabasco]] in places such as San Lorenzo; large temples on pyramid bases can still be seen in sites such as Montenegro, [[Chiapa de Corzo (Mesoamerican site)|Chiapa de Corzo]] and [[La Venta]]. This practice spread to the [[Oaxaca]] area and the [[Valley of Mexico]], appearing in cities such as [[Monte Alb\u00e1n]], [[Cuicuilco]] and [[Teotihuacan]].<ref name=\"salvat vol 1p11\" /><ref name=\"salvatvol1p18\">Rosas Volume 1, p.18.</ref>\n\n[[File:Feather_headdress_Moctezuma_II.JPG|thumb|left|[[Montezuma's headdress]]. It is now in the [[Museum of Ethnology, Vienna]], and is a source of dispute between [[Austria]] and [[Mexico]], as no similar pieces remain in Mexico.]]\n\nThese cities had a nucleus of one or more plazas, with temples, palaces and [[Mesoamerican ball court]]s. Alignment of these structures was based on the cardinal directions and astronomy for ceremonial purposes, such as focusing the sun's rays during the spring equinox on a sculpted or painted image. This was generally tied to calendar systems.<ref name=\"salvatvol1p2023\">Rosas Volume 1, p.20-23.</ref> Relief sculpture and/or painting were created as the structures were built. By the latter pre-Classic, almost all monumental structures in Mesoamerica had extensive relief work. Some of the best examples of this are Monte Alb\u00e1n, Teotihuacan and [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]].<ref name=\"salvatvol2p5\">Rosas Volume 2, p.5.</ref>\n\nPre-Hispanic reliefs are general lineal in design and low, medium and high reliefs can be found. While this technique is often favored for narrative scenes elsewhere in the world, Mesoamerican reliefs tend to focus on a single figure. The only time reliefs are used in the narrative sense is when several relief steles are placed together. The best relief work is from the Mayas, especially from [[Yaxchilan]].<ref name=\"salvatvol2p4\">Rosas Volume 2, p.4.</ref>\n\nWriting and art were not distinct as they have been for European cultures. Writing was considered art and art was often covering in writing.<ref name=\"pazp41\" /> The reason for this is that both sought to record history and the culture's interpretation of reality. (salvatvolp14) Manuscripts were written on paper or other book-like materials then bundled into [[Mesoamerican codices|codices]].<ref name=\"eboone\">Boone 2000, p. 28.</ref> The art of reading and writing was strictly designated to the highest priest classes, as this ability was a source of their power over society.<ref name=\"salvatvol3p2\" /><ref name=\"salvatvol3p7\" />\n\nThe [[Mesoamerican writing systems|pictograms or glyphs of this writing system]] were more formal and rigid than images found on murals and other art forms as they were considered mostly symbolic, representing formulas related to astronomical events, genealogy and historic events.<ref name=\"salvatvol3p7\" /> Most surviving pre-Hispanic codices come from the late Mesoamerican period and early colonial period, as more of these escaped destruction over history.

Indigenous craftsmen were taught European motifs, designs and techniques, but very early work, called ''tequitqui'' ([[Nahuatl]] for \"vassal\"), includes elements such as flattened faces and high-stiff relief.<ref name=\"salvatvol4p34\">Rosas Volume 4, p.34.</ref><ref name=\"mexorg\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mexicanarchitecture.org/glossary/index.php?detail=121 |last=Ekland |first=Charlote |title=Mexican Colonial Architecture |publisher=Mexican Architecture |accessdate=November 29, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120526112024/http://www.mexicanarchitecture.org/glossary/index.php?detail=121 |archive-date=May 26, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Spanish friars directing construction were not trained architects or engineers. They relied on indigenous stonemasons and sculptors to build churches and other Christian structures, often in the same places as temples and shrines of the traditional religion. \"Although some Indians complained about the burden such labor represented, most communities considered a large and impressive church to be a reflection of their town's importance and took justifiable pride in creating a sacred place for divine worship.\"<ref>Ida Altman, Sarah Cline, Javier Pescador, ''The Early History of Greater Mexico''.

An important early manuscript that was commissioned for the Spanish crown was [[Codex Mendoza]], named after the first viceroy of Mexico, Don [[Antonio de Mendoza]], which shows the tribute delivered to the Aztec ruler from individual towns as well as descriptions of proper comportment for the common people. A far more elaborate project utilizing indigenous scribes illustration is the project resulting in the [[Florentine Codex]] directed by Franciscan [[Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan]].  Other indigenous manuscripts in the colonial era include the [[Huexotzinco Codex]] and Codex Osuna.\n\nAn important type of manuscript from the early period were pictorial and textual histories of the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs from the indigenous viewpoint.  The early [[Lienzo de Tlaxcala]] illustrated the contributions the Spaniards' Tlaxcalan allies made to the defeat of the Aztec Empire, as well the [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] and his cultural translator Do\u00f1a Marina ([[Malinche]]).\n\n'''Painting''' Most Nahua artists producing this visual art are anonymous.  An exception is the work of Juan Gerson, who ca. 1560 decorated the vault of the Franciscan church in the Nahua town of Tecamachalco,(Puebla state), with individual scenes from the Old Testament.<ref>Schrefler, \"Visual Arts\", p.1556.</ref>\n\nWhile colonial art remained almost completely European in style, with muted colors and no indication of movement\u2014the addition of native elements, which began with the ''tequitqui,'' continued.

This included mendicant friars, such as Fray Alonso L\u00f3pez de Herrera. Later, most artists were born in Mexico, but trained in European techniques, often from imported engravings. This dependence on imported copies meant that Mexican works preserved styles after they had gone out of fashion in Europe.<ref name=\"jflam\" /> In the colonial period, artists worked in guilds, not independently.

Self-portrait]]\nBaroque painting became firmly established in Mexico by the middle of the 17th century with the work of Spaniard Sebasti\u00e1n L\u00f3pez de Arteaga. His painting is exemplified by the canvas called ''Doubting Thomas'' from 1643. In this work, the [[Apostle Thomas]] is shown inserting his finger in the wound in Christ's side to emphasize Christ's suffering. The caption below reads \"the Word made flesh\" and is an example of Baroque's didactic purpose.<ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nOne difference between painters in Mexico and their European counterparts is that they preferred realistic directness and clarity over fantastic colors, elongated proportions and extreme spatial relationships. The goal was to create a realistic scene in which the viewer could imagine himself a part of. This was a style created by [[Caravaggio]] in Italy, which became popular with artists in [[Seville]], from which many migrants came to New Spain came.<ref name=\"Britannica\" /> Similarly, Baroque free standing sculptures feature life-size scales, realistic skin tones and the simulation of gold-threaded garments through a technique called ''estofado'', the application of paint over gold leaf.<ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\n[[File:Vista de la Fachada del Templo de San Francisco Acatepec 9.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Church of San Francisco Acatepec]] with Baroque Talavera tiling]]\nThe most important later influence to Mexican and other painters in Latin America was the work of Flemish artist [[Peter Paul Rubens]], known through copies made from engravings and [[mezzotint]] techniques. His paintings were copied and reworked and became the standard for both religious and secular art.<ref name=\"Britannica\" /> Later Baroque paintings moved from the confines of altarpieces to colossal freestanding canvases on church interiors. One of the best known Mexican painters of this kind of work was [[Crist\u00f3bal de Villalpando]]. His work can be seen in the [[sacristy]] of the Mexico City Cathedral, which was done between 1684 and 1686. These canvases were glued directly onto the walls with arched frames to stabilize them, and placed just under the vaults of the ceiling. Even the fresco work of the 16th century was not usually this large.<ref name=\"Britannica\" /> Another one of Villalpando's works is the cupola of the [[Puebla Cathedral]] in 1688. He used Rubens' brush techniques and the shape of the structure to create a composition of clouds with angels and saints, from which a dove descends to represent the Holy Spirit. The light from the cupola's windows is meant to symbolize God's grace.<ref name=\"Britannica\" /> [[Juan Rodr\u00edguez Ju\u00e1rez]] (1675\u20131728) and mulatto artist [[Juan Correa]] (1646\u20131716) were also prominent painters of the baroque era. Correa's most famous student, [[Jos\u00e9 de Ibarra]] (1685\u20131756), was also mixed-race.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} One of Mexico's finest painters, [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]] (1695\u20131768), was likely mixed race.<ref>Ilona Katzew, \"Valiant Styles: New Spanish Painting, 1700\u201385\" in ''Painting in Latin America, 1550\u20131820'', Luisa Elena Alcal\u00e1 and Jonathan Brown, eds.

In a society characterized by a deep religious feeling which was imbued, it is not surprising that many portraits reflected the moral virtues and piety of the model.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.retratos.org/pdfs/TRG_121504b.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305145806/http://www.retratos.org/pdfs/TRG_121504b.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-05 }}</ref>\n\nWhile most commissioned art was for churches, secular works were commissioned as well. Portrait painting was known relatively early in the colonial period, mostly of viceroys and archbishops, as well as the conqueror [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]]. Portraits of royal and ecclesiastical officials were an approximation of the sitter's appearance, and were displayed in their official settings. They often included their coats of arms.  In the sixteenth-century portrait of Cort\u00e9s, the conqueror is portrayed with a baton, sword, and armor \"symbolize political and military might, but the discarded glove helmet and glove reveal that his warring activities are completed.\"<ref>Donahue-Wallace, p. 204.</ref> Portraits of viceroys and ecclesiastics were often portrayed in rich clothing and writing implements, along with their coats of arms indicating their genealogy and high standing as well as books and writing implements. In Mexico, there are few exemplars of royal officials from before the eighteenth century, perhaps because the 1696 riot destroyed the portrait gallery in the viceregal palace.<ref>Donahue-Wallace, ''Art and Architecture of Viceregal Latin America'', p. 201, 204.</ref>\n\nBeginning in the late seventeenth century, portrait painting of local elites became a significant genre. Especially important is that women were portrayed for the first time, starting in the eighteenth century. These works followed European models, with symbols of rank and titles either displayed unattached in the outer portions or worked into another element of the paintings such as curtains.<ref name=\"Britannica\" /> Elite women were dressed in rich embroidered and embellished dresses, usually of silk and lace, with jewelry and other adornment. Many were painted with fans in their hands. Unlike their male counterparts in elite society showing their status and authority, portraits of women were idealized images of womanhood with symbols of femininity.<ref>Donahue-Wallace, p. 205</ref> A subset of their genre were portraits of nuns when they first professed, dressed in elaborate clothing appropriate for the solemn step they were taking in entering the convent. A notable example is by [[Jos\u00e9 de Alc\u00edbar]] of Sor (sister) Mar\u00eda Ignacia de la Sangre de Cristo, with a ceremonial crown, embroidered robes, and other accoutrements.  Miguel Cabrera's posthumous portrait of Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz, famous in her own time, in her convent cell surrounded by books, is different from most nun's portraits, painted from life or immediately postmortem.  There are also a number of postmortem portraits of nuns.\n\nThere are quite a number of family group portraits with a religious devotional theme, commissioned to show the family's piety, but also as way to display the family's wealth.  Josep Antonio de Ayala was a prominent artist, who is known for painting \"The family of the Valley at the foot of [[Our Lady of Loreto]]\" (c. 1769). This devotional painting was commissioned for the children of the del Valle family in memory of his parents and is characteristic of the painting of this century.<ref>{{cite book|title=Seis Siglos de Arte, Cien Grandes Maestros de Romero|editor-last=de Romero|editor-first=Soumaya Slim|editor-first2=Minerva Mogollan|editor-last2=Garcia|editor-first3=Eva Maria|editor-last3=Ayala Canseco|publisher=Fundacion Carso / Museo Soumaya|year=2006|isbn=9789687794303}}</ref> The Virgin of Loreto is central to the composition, with the stiff figures of the family members are finely dressed.  The men are in fashionable clothing of the era, with the matriarch of the family wearing an embroidered and lace dress, along with pearls. The daughters are shown in the habit of Conceptionist nuns, with ''escudos de monjas'', religious paintings worn on their chests.  The painting is inscribed with in information about its commission and the parents, and the fact that it hung in chapel of the family's hacienda.  The painting is a display of piety and wealth. There are such group paintings with different central religious figures.<ref>Donahue-Wallace, p. 207.</ref>\n\nTwo notable portrait painters are brothers in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century are [[Juan Rodr\u00edguez Ju\u00e1rez]] and [[Nicol\u00e1s Rodr\u00edguez Ju\u00e1rez|Nicol\u00e1s]].

Some were likely commissioned by Spanish functionaries as souvenirs of Mexico. A number of artists of the era created casta paintings, including [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]], [[Jos\u00e9 de Ibarra]], [[Juan Patricio Morlete Ruiz]], [[Francisco Clapera]], and [[Luis de Mena]], but most casta paintings are unsigned. Ibarra, Morlete, and possibly Cabrera were of mixed race and born outside Mexico City.<ref>Ilona Katzew, \"Valiant Styles: New Spanish Painting, 1700-85\" in ''Painting in Latin America, 1550\u20131820'', Luisa Elena Alcal\u00e1 and Jonathan Brown. New Haven: Yale University Press 2014, p. 169.</ref>  Mena's only known casta painting links the Virgin of Guadalupe and the casta system, as well as depictions of fruits and vegetables and scenes of everyday life in mideighteenth-century Mexico. It is one of the most-reproduced examples of casta paintings, one of the small number that show the casta system on a single canvas rather than up to 16 separate paintings. It is unique in uniting the thoroughly secular genre of casta painting with a depiction of the Virgin of Guadalupe.<ref>Sarah Cline, \"Guadalupe and the Castas: The Power of a Singular Colonial Mexican Painting\", ''Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos'', Vol. 31, Issue 2, Summer 2015, pages 218\u2013246.</ref> Production of these paintings stopped after the 1821 conclusion of the [[Mexican War of Independence]], when legal racial categories were repudiated in independent Mexico. Until the run-up to the 500th anniversary of the Columbus's 1492 voyage, casta paintings were of little or no interest, even to art historians, but scholars began systematically studying them as a genre.<ref>Cline, \"Guadalupe and the Castas\", p. 221.</ref><ref>Ilona Katzew.

Large and meant for display in public and private rooms of elite homes, they had a variety of subject matter, ranging from paintings of historical events, real or imagined, allegorical presentations, and scenes from everyday life in Mexico.  Mexico was a crossroads of trade in the colonial period, with goods from Asia and Europe mixing with those locally produced. This convergence is most evident in the decorative arts of New Spain.<ref name=\"dwarren\" /> It was popular among the upper classes to have a main public room, called a ''salon de estrado'', to be covered in rugs and cushions for women to recline in Moorish fashion. Stools and later chairs and settees were added for men.  Starting in the seventeenth century when the [[Manila Galleon]] sailed regularly from the [[Philippines]] to the Pacific port of [[Acapulco]], folding screens or ''biombos'' (from the Japanese ''byo-bu'' or \"protection from wind\") were among the luxury goods brought from Asia. They are known to have been brought by 1610 and were subsequently produced by Mexican artists and artisans in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. They were fashionable Mexican elites at the highest level and some were shipped to Europe.  Most appear to have been produced locally in Mexico.\n\n[[Juan Correa]] produced several in the late seventeenth century, one of the 1519 meeting of [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] and [[Moctezuma II|Moctezuma]], which might have depicted more current events of an traditional Indian dance (''mitote'') performed on feast of Corpus Christi, symbolizing indigenous submission to Spanish rule and Christianity. Cort\u00e9s is presented as \"both a secular and religious hero\" while Moctezuma on a ceremonial litter has \"the trappings of a Roman emperor,\" depicting a meeting of equals.<ref>Oles, ''Art and Architecture in Mexico'', p. 85.</ref> Another was allegorical, entitled ''The Four Continents'' (ca. 1683), showing Europe, America, Asia and Africa with Europe and Asia at the center, and America and Africa at either end.<ref>Oles, ''Art and Architecture in Mexico'', pp. 80-81.</ref><ref>Donohue-Wallace, ''Art and Architecture of Viceregal Latin America'', pp. 211-217.</ref> The earliest of these Mexican made screens had oriental designs but later ones had European and Mexican themes. One example of this is a screen by an anonymous artist with the conquest of Mexico one side and an aerial view of central Mexico City's streets and buildings, but no people, on the other, now at the [[Franz Mayer Museum]].<ref name=\"dwarren\" /> Another is a local scene of an Indian wedding, with ''voladores'' (\"flyers\") suspended by ropes on their feet.\n\n====Gallery====\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Large_screen_of_the_Palace_of_the_Viceroys_of_Mexico,_ca._1676-1700,_Mexico_City,_Museum_of_the_Americas,_anonimous_painter.jpg|Large screen of the Palace of the Viceroys of Mexico, ca. 1676-1700, Mexico City, Museum of the Americas\nFile:ScreenConquest17Cent01.jpg|A [[Folding screen|Biombo screen]] with a depiction of the Spanish conquest of Mexico at the [[Franz Mayer Museum]]\nFile:Los Cuatro Elementos - Juan Correa.jpg|[[Juan Correa]], ''The liberal arts and the four elements'' (Las artes liberales y los cuatro elementos). 1670\nFile:Folding Screen with Indian Wedding and Flying Pole (Biombo con desposorio ind\u00edgena y palo volador) - Google Art Project.jpg|Folding Screen with Indian Wedding and [[Danza de los Voladores|Voladores]], ca. 1690\nDisplayRoomFranzMayer.jpg|One of the display areas in the Franz Mayer Museum in Mexico City\nDisplayroomFranzMayerDF.jpg|One of the display areas in the Franz Mayer Museum in Mexico City\n</gallery>\n\n===The Academy of San Carlos===\n{{Main|Academy of San Carlos}}\n[[File:Rafael Ximeno y Planes - Portrait of Manuel Tols\u00e1 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of [[Manuel Tols\u00e1]], architect and director of the [[Academy of San Carlos]] by [[Rafael Ximeno y Planes]], director of painting at the Academy]]\nThe last colonial era art institution established was the [[Academy of San Carlos]] in 1783.<ref name=\"statesponsored\">{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253329 |title=State sponsored art |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}</ref> While the depiction of saints consumed most artistic efforts, they were not without political effects.

This style was a reinterpretation of Greco-Roman references and its use was a way to reinforce European dominance in the Spain's colonies. One Neoclassical artist from the Academy at the end of the colonial period was [[Manuel Tols\u00e1]]. He first taught sculpture at the [[Academy of San Carlos]] and then became its second director. Tols\u00e1 designed a number of [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical buildings]] in Mexico but his best known work is an equestrian status of King Charles IV in bronze cast in 1803 and originally placed in the [[Z\u00f3calo]]. As of 2011 it can be seen at the [[Museo Nacional de Arte]].<ref name=\"statesponsored\" />\n\nBy the late 18th century, Spain's colonies were becoming culturally independent from Spain, including its arts. The Academy was established by the [[Spanish Crown]] to regain control of artistic expression and the messages it disseminated. This school was staffed by Spanish artists in each of the major disciplines, with the first director being Antonio Gil.<ref name=\"statesponsored\" /> The school became home to a number of plaster casts of classic statues from the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando|San Fernando Fine Arts Academy]] in Spain, brought there for teaching purposes.

The new government continued to favor [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] as it considered the [[Baroque]] a symbol of colonialism.

However, indigenous themes appeared in paintings and sculptures. One indigenous figure depicted in Neoclassical style is Tlahuicol, done by [[Catalan people|Catalan]] artist [[:es:Manuel Vilar|Manuel Vilar]] in 1851.\n\nThere were two reasons for this shift in preferred subject. The first was that Mexican society denigrated colonial culture\u2014the indigenous past was seen as more truly Mexican.<ref name=\"dwarren\" /> The other factor was a worldwide movement among artists to confront society, which began around 1830. In Mexico, this anti-establishment sentiment was directed at the Academy of San Carlos and its European focus.<ref name=\"pazp2\">Paz, 1987 p.2.</ref>\n\nIn the first half of the 19th century, the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] style of painting was introduced into Mexico and the rest of Latin America by foreign travelers interested in the newly independent country. One of these was [[Bavaria]]n artist [[Johann Moritz Rugendas]], who lived in the country from 1831 to 1834. He painted scenes with dynamic composition and bright colors in accordance with Romantic style, looking for striking, sublime, and beautiful images in Mexico as well as other areas of Latin America. However much of Rugendas's works are sketches for major canvases, many of which were never executed. Others include Englishman [[Daniel Thomas Egerton|Daniel Egerton]], who painted landscapes in the British Romantic tradition, and German [[Carl Nebel]], who primarily created [[lithograph]]s of the various social and ethnic populations of the country.<ref name=\"foreigntravel\">{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253334 |title=Foreign Travelers |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nA number of native-born artists at the time followed the European Romantic painters in their desire to document the various cultures of Mexico. These painters were called ''[[Costumbrismo|costumbristas]]'', a word deriving from ''costumbre'' (custom). The styles of these painters were not always strictly Romantic, involving other styles as well. Most of these painters were from the upper classes and educated in Europe. While the European painters viewed subjects as exotic, the costumbristas had a more nationalistic sense of their home countries. One of these painters was [[Agust\u00edn Arrieta]] from Puebla, who applied realistic techniques to scenes from his home city, capturing its brightly painted tiles and ceramics. His scenes often involved everyday life such as women working in kitchen and depicted black and Afro-Mexican vendors.<ref name=\"costumbristas\">{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253335 |title=Costumbristas |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n====Gallery====\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Entrada del Generalisimo Don Agustin de Iturbide a Mexico.jpg|Entrance of [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]] to Mexico City in 1821.

Dr Atl was born \"Gerard Murillo\" in [[Guadalajara, Mexico|Guadalajara]] in 1875. He changed his name in order to identify himself as Mexican. Atl worked to promote [[Mexican handcrafts and folk art|Mexico's folk art and handcrafts]]. While he had some success as a painter in Guadalajara, his radical ideas against academia and the government prompted him to move to more liberal Mexico City. In 1910, months before the start of the [[Mexican Revolution]], Atl painted the first modern mural in Mexico. He taught major artists to follow him, including those who came to dominate Mexican mural painting.<ref name=\"tburton\" />\n\nThe muralist movement reached its height in the 1930s with four main protagonists: [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], [[Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco]], and Fernando Leal.

The main goal in many of these paintings was the glorification of Mexico's pre-Hispanic past as a definition of Mexican identity.<ref name=\"jcummings\" /> They had success in both Mexico and the United States, which brought them fame and wealth as well as Mexican and American students.<ref name=\"pazp24\" />\n\n[[File:The_Kid_-_Diego_Rivera.jpg|thumb|left|Mural [[Sue\u00f1o de una Tarde Dominical en la Alameda Central]] in Mexico City, featuring Rivera and Frida Kahlo standing by La Calavera Catrina.]]\n\nThese muralists revived the fresco technique for their mural work, although Siqueiros moved to industrial techniques and materials such as the application of [[pyroxilin]], a commercial enamel used for airplanes and automobiles.<ref name=\"jcummings\" /> One of Rivera's earliest mural efforts emblazoned the courtyard of the Ministry of Education with a series of dancing tehuanas (natives of [[Tehuantepec]] in southern Mexico).

Having suffered a crippling bus accident earlier in her teenage life, she began to challenge Mexico's obsession with the female body. Her portraits, purposefully small, addressed a wide range of topics not being addressed by the mainstream art world at the time. These included motherhood, domestic violence, and male egoism.\n\nHer paintings never had subjects wearing lavish jewelry or fancy clothes like those found in muralist paintings. Instead, she would sparsely dress herself up, and when there were accessories, it added that much more importance to them. She would also depict herself in very surreal, unsettling scenarios like in ''[[The Two Fridas]]'' where she depicts two versions of herself, one with a broken heart and one with a healthy infusing the broken heart with \"hopeful\" blood., or Henry Ford Hospital where she depicts herself in having an abortion and the struggle she had in real life coming to terms with it.\n\nAlthough she was the wife of Diego Rivera, her self-portraits stayed rather obscured from the public eye until well after her passing in 1954.  Her art has grown in popularity and she is seen by many to be one of the earliest and most influential feminist artists of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite book|last=Meade |first=Teresa |title=The History of Modern Latin America |year=2016 |pages=192\u2013193}}</ref>\n\n=====Gallery=====\n<gallery>\nFile:Hidalgo de Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco.JPG|[[Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco]], [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]], Jalisco Governmental Palace, Guadalajara\nFile:LaTrincheraOrozcoSICDF.JPG|[[Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco]], ''The Trench'' [[San Ildefonso College]], Mexico City\nFile:Murales Rivera - Markt in Tlatelolco 3.jpg|[[Diego Rivera]] ''Tenochtitlan'', [[National Palace (Mexico)|Palacio Nacional]], Mexico City.\nFile:RiveraMuralNationalPalace.jpg|[[Diego Rivera]] Mural in the main stairwell of the National Palace\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: File:Rivera-the-arsenal.jpg|[[Diego Rivera]] ''The Arsenal'' detail, 1928 -->\nFile:Mural David Alfaro Siqueiros en el Tecpan Tlatelolco.jpg|[[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], Mural at Tecpan\nFile:EagleSnakeMexicoCharlotSICDF.JPG|[[Jean Charlot]], Eagle and snake, [[San Ildefonso College]]\nFile:Mural_-_nopal.jpg|Part of the mural [[Presencia de Am\u00e9rica Latina]] by [[Jorge Gonz\u00e1lez Camarena]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Other Artistic Expressions 1920\u20131950===\n{{See also|Museo Casa Chihuahua}}\n[[File:HoyTamayoBADF.JPG|thumb|''Mexico de Hoy'' by Rufino Tamayo on the first floor of the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]]]]\nThe first to break with the nationalistic and political tone of the muralist movement was [[Rufino Tamayo]].

These films featured archetypal star figures and symbols based on broad national mythologies. Some of the mythology according to [[Carlos Monsiv\u00e1is]], includes the participants in family melodramas, the masculine ''[[charro]]s'' of ranchero films, [[femme fatale]]s (often played by [[Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix]] and [[Dolores del R\u00edo]]), the indigenous peoples of [[Emilio Fern\u00e1ndez]]'s films, and [[Cantinflas]]'s ''peladito'' (urban miscreant).<ref name=\"strayer\" />\n\nSettings were often [[ranches]], the battlefields of the [[Mexican Revolution|revolution]], and [[cabaret]]s.

The first was a generation of talented actors and filmmakers. These included actors such as [[Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix]], [[Jorge Negrete]], [[Pedro Armend\u00e1riz]], [[Pedro Infante]], [[Cantinflas]], and directors such as [[Emilio Fern\u00e1ndez|Emilio \"El Indio\" Fernandez]] and cinematographer [[Gabriel Figueroa]].

Much of the production during the Golden Age was financed with a mix of public and private money, with the government eventually taking a larger role. In 1942 the Banco Cinematogr\u00e1fico financed almost all of the industry, coming under government control by 1947. This gave the government extensive censorship rights through deciding which projects to finance.<ref name=\"strayer\" /> While the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) censored films in many ways in the 1940s and 1950s, it was not as repressive as other Spanish speaking countries, but it played a strong role in how Mexico's government and culture was portrayed.<ref name=\"strayer\" /><ref name=\"roads\" />\n\nThe Golden Age ended in the late 1950s, with the 1960s dominated by poorly made imitations of Hollywood westerns and comedies. These films were increasingly shot outdoors and popular films featured stars from [[lucha libre]]. Art and experimental film production in Mexico has its roots in the same period, which began to bear fruit in the 1970s.<ref name=\"truax\" /><ref name=\"roads\" /> Director [[Paul Leduc (film director)|Paul Leduc]] surfaced in the 1970s, specializing in films without dialogue. His first major success was with ''[[Reed: Insurgent Mexico]]'' (1971) followed by a biography of [[Frida Kahlo]] called ''Frida'' (1984). He is the most consistently political of modern Mexican directors. In the 1990s, he filmed ''Latino Bar'' (1991) and ''Dollar Mambo'' (1993). His silent films generally have not had commercial success.<ref name=\"roads\" />\n\n[[File:Amores-perros-logo.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.13|''[[Amores perros]]'' won 11 [[Ariel Award]]s and the 2001 [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language]].]]\n\nIn the late 20th century the main proponent of Mexican art cinema was [[Arturo Ripstein|Arturo Ripstein Jr.]]. His career began with a spaghetti Western-like film called ''Tiempo de morir'' in 1965 and who some consider the successor to [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]] who worked in Mexico in the 1940s. Some of his classic films include ''[[The Castle of Purity|El Castillo de la pureza]]'' (1973), ''[[The Place Without Limits|Lugar sin limites]]'' (1977) and ''[[The Queen of the Night|La reina de la noche]]'' (1994) exploring topics such as family ties and even homosexuality, dealing in cruelty, irony, and tragedy.<ref name=\"roads\" />\nState censorship was relatively lax in the 1960s and early 1970s, but came back during the latter 1970s and 1980s, monopolizing production and distribution.<ref name=\"truax\" />\n\n[[File:Fantasy_Worlds_of_Myth_and_Magic,_EMP,_Seattle_(15388051142).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.13|Faun face from [[Pan's Labyrinth]] displayed at Fantasy: Worlds of Myth and Magic, Experience Music Project/Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Seattle.

The movie was banned by the government but received support in Mexico and abroad. The film was shown although not widely.{{elucidate|date=January 2012}}<!--Shown where? In Mexico?

One reason for international interest in Mexican cinema was the wild success of the 1992 film [[Like Water for Chocolate (film)|''Como Agua Para Chocolate'']] (''Like Water for Chocolate'').<ref name=\"truax\" /><ref name=\"roads\" /> In 1993, this film was the largest grossing foreign language film in U.S. history and ran in a total of 34 countries.<ref name=\"macdonald\" /> Since then, Mexican film divided into two genres. Those for a more domestic audience tend to be more personal and more ambiguously political such as ''Pueblo de Madera'', ''La Vida Conjugal'', and ''Angel de fuego''. Those geared for international audiences have more stereotypical Mexican images and include ''[[S\u00f3lo con Tu Pareja]]'', ''[[Cronos (film)|La Invencion de Cronos]]'' along with ''Como Agua para Chocolate''.<ref name=\"macdonald\" /><ref name=\"roads\" />\n\nMexico's newest generation of successful directors includes [[Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu]], [[Guillermo del Toro]], and [[Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n]] known as \"The Three Amigos of Cinema\". Films by this directors include Cuar\u00f3n's ''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]'', del Toro's ''[[The Shape of Water]]'' and I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's ''[[Birdman (film)|Birdman]]''. Film professionals in the early 21st century tend to be at least bilingual (Spanish and English) and are better able to participate in the global market for films than their predecessors.<ref name=\"truax\" />\n\n== Photography in Mexico ==\n{{See also|es:Museo Nacional de la Fotograf\u00eda (M\u00e9xico)|Museo Archivo de la Fotograf\u00eda}}\n[[File:Maximilian and Charlotte.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.13|Photograph of [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian]] and [[Carlota of Mexico|Charlotte]] \u2013 Mexico 1857.

It dates to the [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]] period of rule, or the ''Porfiriato'', from the late 19th century to 1910.<ref name=\"mexconnect\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1086-the-legacy-of-agustin-victor-casasola-photographer-1874-1938 |title= The legacy of Agustin Victor Casasola (Photographer 1874\u20131938) |last=Pomade |first=Rita |date=June 1, 2004 |publisher=Mexconnect |issn= 1028-9089 |accessdate=29 November 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"cuevaswolfp7\">Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.7.</ref> Porfirian-era photography was heavily inclined toward the presentation of the nation's modernization to the rest of the world, with Mexico City as its cultural showpiece.

Like Kahlo, he began his career in the Porfirato, but his career was focused on photography for periodicals. Again like Kahlo, Casasola's work prior to the Mexican Revolution focused on non-controversial photographs, focusing on the lives of the elite. The outbreak of civil war caused Casasola's choice of subject to change. He began to focus not only on portraits of the main protagonists (such as [[Francisco Villa]]) and general battle scenes, but on executions and the dead. He focused on people whose faces showed such expressions as pain, kindness, and resignation.<ref name=\"mexconnect\" />\n\nHis work during this time produced a large collection of photographs, many of which are familiar to Mexicans as they have been widely reprinted and reused, often without credit to Casasola. After the war, Casasola continued to photograph common people, especially migrants to Mexico City during the 1920s and 1930s. His total known archives comprise about half a million images with many of his works archived in the former monastery of San Francisco in [[Pachuca]].<ref name=\"mexconnect\" />\n\n[[File:Decena tr\u00e1gica.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.13|A scene from the [[Decena Tr\u00e1gica]], February 1913, from the [[Casasola Archive]]]]\n\nKahlo and Casasola are considered the two most important photographers to develop the medium in Mexico, with Kahlo defining architectural photography and Casasolas establishing photojournalism. Neither man thought of himself as an artist\u2014especially not Casasolas\u2014who thought of himself as a historian in the [[Positivism|Positivist]] tradition, but the photography of both show attention to detail, lighting, and placement of subjects for emotional or dramatic effect.<ref name=\"cuevaswolfp9\">Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.9.</ref><ref name=\"cuevaswolfp1825\">Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.18-25.</ref>\n\nFor the rest of the 20th century, most photography was connected to documentation. However, artistic trends from both inside and outside the country had an effect. In the 1920s, the dominant photographic style was [[Pictorialism]], in which images had a romantic or dream-like quality due to the use of filters and other techniques. American [[Edward Weston]] broke with this tradition, taking these effects away for more realistic and detailed images.<ref name=\"mexconnect\" /><ref name=\"usatoday\">{{cite news |title= Edward Weston: Pictorialist Pioneer |newspaper=USA Today |date=September 27, 2003 |pages=62\u201365 s }}</ref> This caused a split in the photography world between Pictorialists and Realists both inside and outside of Mexico.<ref name=\"mexconnect\" />\n\n[[File:Villa y zapata.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.36|[[Pancho Villa]] (left) \"commander of the Divisi\u00f3n del Norte (North Division)\", and [[Emiliano Zapata]] \"''Ej\u00e9rcito Libertador del Sur'' ([[Liberation Army of the South]])\" in 1914.

Photography and other arts shifted to depictions of the country's indigenous heritage and the glorification of the Mexican common people.<ref name=\"cuevaswolfp9\" /> This was mainly to reject the elitist and heavily European values of the Porfiriato, along with the increasing cultural influence of the United States in favor of an \"authentic\" and distinct Mexican identity.<ref name=\"cuevaswolfp910\">Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.9-10.</ref> Another was the government's decision to use this imagery, rather than the still-fresh memories of the battles and atrocities of the Revolution to promote itself.<ref name=\"cuevaswolfp27\">Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.27.</ref>\n\n[[File:Modotti Frau in Tehuantepec.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.13|Woman from [[Tehuantepec]] (Mexico), photograph by [[Tina Modotti]].]]\n\nManuel Alvarez Bravo experimented with abstraction in his photography and formed his own personal style concerned with Mexican rites and customs. He was active from the 1920s until his death in the 1990s. Like other artists of the 20th century, he was concerned with balancing international artistic trends with the expression of Mexican culture and people. His photographic techniques were concerned with transforming the ordinary into the fantastic. From the end of the 1930s to the 1970s his photography developed along with new technologies such as color, using the same themes. In the 1970s, he experimented with female nudes.<ref name=\"aalonso\">{{cite news |title= Manuel Alvarez Bravo: Mexico en imagenes |first=Alejandro |last=Alonso |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=June 13, 1997 |page=14 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Manuel Alvarez Bravo: Mexico in images }}</ref>\n\nThese post-Revolution photographers influenced the generations after them, but the emphasis remained on documentary journalism, especially for newspapers. For this reason, the focus remained on social issues. This included work by [[Nacho L\u00f3pez]] and [[H\u00e9ctor Garc\u00eda Cobos|Hector Garcia]], best known for their photography of the [[Tlatelolco massacre|student uprising of 1968]].<ref name=\"monroy\" />\n\n[[File:Ex\u00e8rcit_al_Z\u00f3calo-28_d'agost.jpg|thumb|right|The \"Z\u00f3calo\" in Mexico City in 1968]]\n\nDuring the 1970s, a fusion of various styles retained a social focus.<ref name=\"monroy\" /> During the same period, institutions were established that dedicated themselves to the promotion of photography and conservation of photographs, such as the Centro de la Imagen, the Fototeca Nacional del [[INAH]], and the publication ''Luna C\u00f3rnea''.<ref name=\"grandes\">{{cite news |title= Los 13 grandes de la fotograf\u00eda mexicana |first=Yanet |last=Aguilar Sosa |url= http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/sociedad/3014.html |newspaper=El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=May 20, 2009 |accessdate=November 30, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The 13 greats of Mexican photography }}</ref>\n\nPhotography in Mexico from the latter 20th century on remains mostly focused on photojournalism and other kinds of documentary. Francisco Mata de Rosas is considered the most notable photographer in contemporary Mexico mostly working with documentaries.{{according to whom|date=January 2012}} He has published a number of books including ''M\u00e9xico Tenochtitlan'' and ''Tepito, Bravo el Barrio''. Eniac Mart\u00ednez specializes in panoramas. Patricia Aridjis works with social themes, mostly to illustrate books. Gerardo Montiel Klint's work has been described as a \"shadowing and dark world\", focusing on the angst and violence of adolescents.<ref name=\"grandes\" /> The most recent generation of photographers work with new and digital technologies. One of these is [[Javier Orozco]] who specializes in interiors.<ref name=\"monroy\" />\n\nHowever, purely artistic photography has had an impact. In 2002, a photographic exhibit by [[Daniela Rossell]] featured images of Mexican multimillionaires posing in their ostentatious homes, filled with expensive paintings, hunting trophies, crystal chandeliers, gold lam\u00e9 wallpaper, and household help. The photographs set off a wave of social criticism as well as tabloid gossip.<ref name=\"rgallop47\">Gallo, 2004 p.47.</ref>\n\n=== Gallery ===\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Piedra del sol Porfirio Diaz.png|[[Porfirio D\u00edaz]] with the [[Piedra del Sol]], photographer not known\nFile:Emiliano Zapata-Libreria del Congreso.jpg|General [[Emiliano Zapata]], leader of revolutionaries in Morelos beginning in 1911 and ending in his assassination in 1919<ref>Archivo General de la Naci\u00f3n, Mexico City, Archivo Fotogr\u00e1fico D\u00edaz, Delgado y Garc\u00eda.</ref>\nFile:David Alfaro Siqueiros (El Coronelazo).jpg|Siqueiros by [[H\u00e9ctor Garc\u00eda Cobo]] at Lecumberri prison, Mexico City, 1960.\nFile:Ni\u00f1o Soldado.jpg|Boy soldier during the [[Mexican Revolution]], [[Casasola Archive]].<ref>Photograph by Antonio Gomes Delgado ''El Negro'', Casasola Archive, Mexico</ref>\nFile:Centro-fotografico-in-oaxaca-founded-by-toledo.jpg|[[Centro Fotogr\u00e1fico \u00c1lvarez Bravo]] at the [[Institute of Graphic Arts of Oaxaca]].\nFile:0000-1938-DESFILE DEL 16 DE SEPTIEMBRE (2) (38866081012).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.13|Photo of the Independence Day parade (September 16) in Mexico City at the [[Museo Archivo de la Fotograf\u00eda]] (Museum of the Photographic Archive).\nFile:UNAMBiblioteca1974.jpg|[[National Autonomous University of Mexico|National Autonomous University]], Mexico City.

It was named after Edward B. Purcell, a vice president of the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe]] railroad (ATSF). Purcell was at the north end of the [[Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway]], owned by the ATSF. [[Amtrak]] still serves the town with the ''[[Heartland Flyer]]'' at the [[Purcell (Amtrak station)|station]] near the old Santa Fe depot.<ref name=\"EOHC-Purcell\"/>\n\nPurcell was the only town on the border of the Unassigned Lands, and began attracting hopeful settlers even before the [[Land Rush of 1889]]. Town lots went on sale April 5, 1887, and a post office was established 16 days later. The ''Purcell Register'', the town's oldest newspaper, was established in 1887, and continued operating into the 21st Century. Residents elected the town's first mayor, James Taylor Bradley, on August 13, 1895. The town was incorporated on October 3, 1898.<ref name=\"EOHC-Purcell\"/>\n\nLocated on the Canadian River, it was called the \"Queen City of the Chickasaw Nation.\" In 1895, one of the five district courts of the Chickasaw Nation was located in Purcell, with the first session opening November 18, 1895. The court house escaped destruction the next day, when a fire destroyed most of the buildings in the business district.<ref name=\"EOHC-Purcell\"/>\n\nConstruction of the Oklahoma Central Railway (OCR), which would connect the Lehigh coal mines with Chickasha, reached Purcell in March 1907. The OCR located its main yards, barns and most of its equipment in Purcell.

Nance Memorial Bridge, viewed from Purcell train station]]\nPurcell's downtown business district and its many historic buildings underwent major improvements and revitalization at a cost of over $1 million in the 1990s via the \"U.S. Main Street\" program. The improvements included new sidewalks, Victorian lamp posts, storefront restorations, and landscape islands in the downtown area.\n\nPurcell has three listings on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in McClain County, Oklahoma|National Register of Historic Places]]:\n* Hotel Love. A three-story Victorian brick building that currently houses an antique store, a bed and breakfast inn, and retail offices/storefronts.\n* McClain County Courthouse. An original turn-of-the-century three-story brick building.  It underwent a $2 million restoration in 1995.\n* [[James C. Nance Memorial Bridge]] spans the South Canadian River, connecting Purcell to Lexington. The former deck truss bridge rebuilt in 2019 as 4-lane concrete pier bridge is among the longest in Oklahoma. The bridge is named for [[James C. Nance]], a newspaper publisher and legislative leader in Oklahoma and U.S. Uniform Law Commissioner. Nance was the publisher of a chain of community newspapers in Oklahoma, including the Purcell Register. Nance was the original legislative sponsor to construct the bridge, which was part of his campaign platform when he first ran for the position.\n\n==US 77 James C. Nance Memorial Bridge between Purcell and Lexington==\nThe US 77 [[James C. Nance Memorial Bridge]] was originally built as a circa 1938 [[deck truss]] 2-lane bridge and in 2019 rebuilt as a concrete pier 4-lane bridge <ref name= \"Oklahoma\" >Department of Transportation, website.

Accessed 26 July 2019.</ref> crossing the [[Canadian River]] between Purcell and [[Lexington, Oklahoma]]. The bridge carries [[U.S. Route 77 in Oklahoma|U.S. Route&nbsp;77]] (US-77) and [[Oklahoma State Highway&nbsp;39]] (SH-39) from [[McClain County, Oklahoma|McClain County]] to [[Cleveland County, Oklahoma|Cleveland County]]. The bridge is named for [[James C. Nance]], longtime community newspaper chain publisher and former Speaker of the Oklahoma House of Representatives, President Pro-Tem of Oklahoma State Senate and Uniform Law Commissioner.\n\nThe Nance bridge allows travel time from Purcell (west side of the Canadian river) to Lexingon (East side of the river) to be only 3 minutes by car, according to google maps. When the bridge was closed for emergency repairs, the same trip was 43 minutes when re-routed North to the nearest bridge, or 1 hour and 4 minutes when re-routed Southeast to the nearest bridge.\n\nThe 1938 construction of this bridge enabled communities from West and Southwest (Byars, Cole, Dibble, Paoli, Pauls Valley, Purcell, Rosedale, and Wayne) side of the river to reach the communities on the East side of the river (Lexington, Slaughterville, and Wanette). Traffic using the bridge allows trade and commerce to freely flow in this retail trade area of southern McClain County, southern Cleveland County, Southern Pottawatomie County, and northern area of Garvin County, and eastern portion of Grady county. The 2019 rebuilt bridge features the same design elements with concrete post and wrought iron railings with protected turn lane and sidewalks.<ref name=\"Oklahoma\"/>\n\nAccording to the Oklahoma Department of Transportation, \"History was made Friday July 26, 2019  in Purcell and Lexington, just as it was more than 80 years ago when the two cities celebrated the grand opening of a new bridge connecting their communities.

The territorial courthouse was established under the [[Nonintercourse Act]]. Beginning with the [[Dawes Act of 1887]], Congress passed several laws designed to divide and allocate land between members of the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek and Seminole tribes in the Indian Territory (modern-day Oklahoma). As part of this scheme, subsequent legislation authorized a \u201cCommission to the Five Civilized Tribes,\u201d commonly known as the [[Dawes Commission]], to determine the citizenship of Native Americans claiming membership in these tribes. Unsuccessful applicants were entitled to appeal to the United States Court for the Indian Territory which was located on the east end of  Main Street in Purcell OK.\n\n==Education==\n* A $14 million public high school was constructed in 2007\u20132008.

Nance Memorial Bridge, viewed from Purcell train station]]\nPurcell's downtown business district and its many historic buildings underwent major improvements and revitalization at a cost of over $1 million in the 1990s via the \"U.S. Main Street\" program. The improvements included new sidewalks, Victorian lamp posts, storefront restorations, and landscape islands in the downtown area.\n\nPurcell has three listings on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in McClain County, Oklahoma|National Register of Historic Places]]:\n* Hotel Love. A three-story Victorian brick building that currently houses an antique store, a bed and breakfast inn, and retail offices/storefronts.\n* McClain County Courthouse. An original turn-of-the-century three-story brick building.  It underwent a $2 million restoration in 1995.\n* [[James C. Nance Memorial Bridge]] spans the South Canadian River, connecting Purcell to Lexington. The former deck truss bridge rebuilt in 2019 as 4-lane concrete pier bridge is among the longest in Oklahoma. The bridge is named for [[James C. Nance]], a newspaper publisher and legislative leader in Oklahoma and U.S. Uniform Law Commissioner. Nance was the publisher of a chain of community newspapers in Oklahoma, including the Purcell Register. Nance was the original legislative sponsor to construct the bridge, which was part of his campaign platform when he first ran for the position.\n\n==US 77 James C. Nance Memorial Bridge between Purcell and Lexington==\nThe US 77 [[James C. Nance Memorial Bridge]] was originally built as a circa 1938 [[deck truss]] 2-lane bridge and in 2019 rebuilt as a concrete pier 4-lane bridge <ref name= \"Oklahoma\" >Department of Transportation, website. [https://www.ok.gov/odot/Purcell_Lexington_Bridge_project.html].  \u201cUS-77 James C. Nance Bridge between Purcell and Lexington\u201d. Accessed 26 July 2019.</ref> crossing the [[Canadian River]] between Purcell and [[Lexington, Oklahoma]]. The bridge carries [[U.S. Route 77 in Oklahoma|U.S. Route&nbsp;77]] (US-77) and [[Oklahoma State Highway&nbsp;39]] (SH-39) from [[McClain County, Oklahoma|McClain County]] to [[Cleveland County, Oklahoma|Cleveland County]]. The bridge is named for [[James C. Nance]], longtime community newspaper chain publisher and former Speaker of the Oklahoma House of Representatives, President Pro-Tem of Oklahoma State Senate and Uniform Law Commissioner.\n\nThe Nance bridge allows travel time from Purcell (west side of the Canadian river) to Lexingon (East side of the river) to be only 3 minutes by car, according to google maps. When the bridge was closed for emergency repairs, the same trip was 43 minutes when re-routed North to the nearest bridge, or 1 hour and 4 minutes when re-routed Southeast to the nearest bridge.\n\nThe 1938 construction of this bridge enabled communities from West and Southwest (Byars, Cole, Dibble, Paoli, Pauls Valley, Purcell, Rosedale, and Wayne) side of the river to reach the communities on the East side of the river (Lexington, Slaughterville, and Wanette). Traffic using the bridge allows trade and commerce to freely flow in this retail trade area of southern McClain County, southern Cleveland County, Southern Pottawatomie County, and northern area of Garvin County, and eastern portion of Grady county. The 2019 rebuilt bridge features the same design elements with concrete post and wrought iron railings with protected turn lane and sidewalks.<ref name=\"Oklahoma\"/>\n\nAccording to the Oklahoma Department of Transportation, \"History was made Friday July 26, 2019  in Purcell and Lexington, just as it was more than 80 years ago when the two cities celebrated the grand opening of a new bridge connecting their communities. The new US 77 Purcell/Lexington [[James C. Nance Bridge]] that links the twin cities, located less than one mile apart, fully opened to traffic with much fanfare on Friday, July 26, 2019, the culmination of a major two-year, expedited reconstruction project.\" <ref name=\"Oklahoma\"/>\n\n==Historic site of Federal Courthouse for Indian Territory==\nThe site of the now demolished U.S. Federal Courthouse for Indian Territory, at the east end of Main Street, is landmark site of the former court of jurisdiction for [[Indian Territory]].  Prior to demolition, it was renovated into a car dealer showroom, later used at fitness center and finally a retail floral shop before it became structurally unsound and demolished. The territorial courthouse was established under the [[Nonintercourse Act]]. Beginning with the [[Dawes Act of 1887]], Congress passed several laws designed to divide and allocate land between members of the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek and Seminole tribes in the Indian Territory (modern-day Oklahoma). As part of this scheme, subsequent legislation authorized a \u201cCommission to the Five Civilized Tribes,\u201d commonly known as the [[Dawes Commission]], to determine the citizenship of Native Americans claiming membership in these tribes. Unsuccessful applicants were entitled to appeal to the United States Court for the Indian Territory which was located on the east end of  Main Street in Purcell OK.\n\n==Education==\n* A $14 million public high school was constructed in 2007-2008. The former high school complex at 4th and Lester Lane is now the junior high school, while a new facility on N. Green Avenue for the junior high school is under construction with adequate storm shelter for both junior high and high school, next door.\n\n==Infrastructure==\n===Parks and recreation===\n* Brent Bruehl Memorial Golf Course. Named to honor a popular and talented Purcell High School golfer whose life was ended by cancer in the mid-1970s.

In Fort Worth, passengers can connect to Amtrak's ''[[Texas Eagle]]''. [[Interstate 35]] runs north\u2013south on the west edge of Purcell.  The town is also served by [[U.S. Highway 77 (Oklahoma)|U.S. Highway 77]], [[State Highway 39 (Oklahoma)|State Highway 39]], and [[State Highway 74 (Oklahoma)|State Highway 74]].<ref name=\"odot-2008-map\">{{cite map|publisher=Oklahoma Department of Transportation|title=Official State Map|edition=2008}}</ref>  In addition, ODOT maintains [[State Highway 77C (Oklahoma)|State Highway 77C]] in downtown Purcell, a route which is [[unsigned highway|not marked]].<ref name=\"odot-control\">{{cite map|publisher=Oklahoma Department of Transportation|title=2008 Control Section Maps|page=McClain 44|url=http://www.odot.org/hqdiv/p-r-div/maps/control-maps/mcclain.pdf}}</ref>\n\nStephen Shephard Memorial Purcell Airport.

Three regular services are sung per week in full University Term, and the choir sings Latin grace from the minstrels' gallery in the college's Great Hall at a number of feasts.\n\nIn addition, the choir undertakes projects outside term-time such as recordings, concerts, radio broadcasts and tours.\n\nThe choir is typically made up of 36 members, many of whom are students in Trinity College.\n\n==Directors of Music ==\n\nThe director of music is [[Stephen Layton]], who succeeded [[Richard Marlow]] in September 2006.\n\n==History of the Choir ==\n\nTrinity College's choral associations date back to the establishment of [[King's Hall, Cambridge|King's Hall]] by [[Edward II]] in 1317 ([[Chaucer]]'s \"Solar Hall\" in ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''). This College, incorporated by [[Edward III]] in 1337, was amalgamated with an adjacent early 14th century foundation, [[Michaelhouse, Cambridge|Michaelhouse]], when [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] created Trinity in 1546. From the time of Edward II, [[Chapel Royal]] choristers, on leaving the Court, customarily entered King's Hall to continue their academic studies, alongside other undergraduates training for service in the royal administration.\n\nThe constitution of the medieval chapel choir remains obscure, but the choral foundation which [[Mary I of England|Mary Tudor]] established in 1553 (ten choristers, six [[lay clerk]]s, four priests, an organist, and a schoolmaster) survived essentially unchanged for over 300 years. Among the musicians associated with the choir during this time were the [[Tudor music|Tudor]] composers [[Thomas Preston (composer)|Thomas Preston]], [[Robert White (composer)|Robert White]] and [[John Hilton the elder]]; [[Robert Ramsey (composer)|Robert Ramsey]] was organist just before the [[English Commonwealth]];{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} the [[lute]]nist and writer [[Thomas Mace]] was a lay clerk for around 70 years from 1635;<ref>{{cite book |title=Life After Death: The Viola Da Gamba in Britain from Purcell to Dolmetsch |authorlink=Peter Holman |last=Holman |first=Peter |year=2010 |publisher=Boydell & Brewer |location=Woodbridge |pages=67\u201368 |isbn=978-1-84383-574-5 }}</ref> and [[Thomas Attwood Walmisley]] was organist in the early 19th century.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, shortly after [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] had graduated from Trinity and [[Alan Gray]] had succeeded [[Charles Villiers Stanford]] as Organist, the College choir school was closed down. Thereafter, a choir of boy trebles (holding scholarships at a local grammar school), lay clerks (some of whom shared their duties with the choirs of [[King's College, Cambridge|King's]] and [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's]] Colleges) and students continued the regular pattern of choral services until the 1950s. This traditionally-constituted body then gave way to a choir of undergraduate tenors and basses during [[Raymond Leppard]]'s tenure as Director of Music, to be replaced with a mixed choir by Richard Marlow in 1982.\n\n==Tours and Concerts ==\n\nThe choir has toured to destinations such as Australia, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, the United States, Canada, the Canary Islands, India, South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe, Peru, and Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Particularly notable events include singing mass at the installation of Abbot Martin Werlen, O.S.B. as Abbot of [[Einsiedeln, Switzerland]], and becoming the first western choir to tour India.\n\nThe choir also performs concerts in the UK, at home in Cambridge and in London ([[South Bank Centre]], [[St John's Smith Square]], [[Spitalfields Festival]]), and around the country. \u2018Livings tours\u2019 allow the choir to visit parishes around the country of which the college is patron and sing services and concerts; these include villages in the Isle of Wight, North Yorkshire, County Durham, Norfolk and the Lake District.\n\n==May Week ==\n\n[[File:cmglee_Cambridge_Singing_from_the_Towers_2013.jpg|thumb|250px|''Singing from the Towers'', 2013]]\n[[File:cmglee_Cambridge_Singing_on_the_River_2013.jpg|thumb|250px|''Singing on the River'', 2013]]\nOn the final Sunday of the academic year the Choir performs two outdoor concerts. At midday the choir sings [[antiphonally]] from two of the towers in the college's [[Trinity Great Court|Great Court]], with a brass ensemble performing from the third. In the evening the choir inaugurates [[May Week]] with the traditional River Concert, in which the [[madrigal]]s and [[part-song]]s are performed upon punts moored at Trinity Backs. The evening's entertainment concludes, as dusk gives way to darkness, with [[Wilbye]]'s madrigal ''Draw on, sweet night'' performed as the choir is punted down the river and out of sight.\n\n==Recordings ==\n===Under Richard Marlow===\n* Purcell: Anthems for the Chapel Royal (Conifer)\n* Poulenc - Sacred Choral Works (1988; Conifer)\n* Walton: Sacred Choral Music (1989; Conifer)\n* Carols from Trinity (1990; Conifer)\n* Glorious Trinity (1990; Conifer)\n* French Sacred Choral Works (1990; Classics)\n* Brahms: Complete Motets (1990; Classics)\n* Victoria: Tenebrae Responsories/Lamentations (1991; Conifer)\n* Sch\u00fctz: Psalmen Davids (1991; Conifer)\n* Monteverdi: Dixit Dominus (1992; Conifer)\n* Monteverdi - Motets  (1992; Classics)\n* Michael Haydn: Masses and Vespers (1993; Classics)\n* Great Is The Lord (1993; Conifer)\n* Miserere and Other Popular Choral Works (1993; Classics)\n* A Child Is Born (1993; Classics)\n* Carols from Trinity (1993; Conifer)\n* Voce: An Intimate Expression of Faith Offered By the Human Voice (1994; Brentwood Music, a compilation)\n* Weelkes/Tomkins - When David Heard (1994; Conifer)\n* Sweelinck: Pseaumes De David (1994; Conifer)\n* Bach: The Six Motets (1994; Conifer)\n* Lassus - Regina coeli and Seasonal Motets (1994; Conifer)\n* Praetorius - In dulci jubilo (1995; Conifer)\n* Gibbons - Hosanna to the Son of David (1995; Conifer)\n* The Songs of Angels (1996; Conifer)\n* Britten - Sacred and Profane (1996)\n* Bach Family Motets (1997; Conifer)\n* Carols from Trinity (1997; Conifer)\n* Choral Moods (1997; Conifer)\n* Descants from Trinity (1997; Conifer)\n* Sweelinck: Cantiones Sacrae, Vol.2 (1999; Hyperion)\n* Sweelinck: Cantiones Sacrae, Vol.1 (1999; Hyperion)\n* Hymns and Descants (2000; GMN)\n* A Trinity Christmas (2001; GMN)\n* Palestrina - Offertoria (2002; GMN)\n* Durufl\u00e9 - Complete Choral Works (2005; Chandos)\n* Mendelssohn - Sacred Choral Works (2006; Chandos)\n* Byrd - Cantiones sacrae (2007; Chandos)\n\n===Under Stephen Layton===\n* Handel - ''[[Dettingen Te Deum]]'' (2008; Hyperion) \n* Poulenc - Gloria & Motets (2008; Hyperion) \n* Lukaszewski - Choral Music (2008; Hyperion)\n* Handel - Chandos Anthems vol. 1 (2009; Hyperion) \n* Various - Baltic Exchange (2010; Hyperion)\n* Briggs - Messe de Notre Dame (2010; Hyperion)\n* American a cappella - Beyond all mortal dreams (2011; Hyperion)\n* Howells - Requiem & other choral works (2012; Hyperion)\n* Britten - A Ceremony of Carols & St Nicolas (2012; Hyperion)\n* Handel - Chandos Anthems vol. 2 (2013; Hyperion)\n* Bach - Christmas Oratorio (2013; Hyperion)\n* E\u0161envalds - Northern Lights & other choral works (2015; Hyperion)\n* Leighton - Crucifixus & other choral works (2015; Hyperion)\n* Various - Yulefest!

Three regular services are sung per week in full University Term, and the choir sings Latin grace from the minstrels' gallery in the college\u2019s Great Hall at a number of feasts.\n\nIn addition, the choir undertakes projects outside term-time such as recordings, concerts, radio broadcasts and tours.\n\nThe choir is typically made up of 36 members, many of whom are students in Trinity College.\n\n==Directors of Music ==\n\nThe director of music is [[Stephen Layton]], who succeeded [[Richard Marlow]] in September 2006.\n\n==History of the Choir ==\n\nTrinity College's choral associations date back to the establishment of [[King's Hall, Cambridge|King's Hall]] by [[Edward II]] in 1317 ([[Chaucer]]'s \"Solar Hall\" in ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''). This College, incorporated by [[Edward III]] in 1337, was amalgamated with an adjacent early 14th century foundation, [[Michaelhouse, Cambridge|Michaelhouse]], when [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] created Trinity in 1546. From the time of Edward II, [[Chapel Royal]] choristers, on leaving the Court, customarily entered King's Hall to continue their academic studies, alongside other undergraduates training for service in the royal administration. \n\nThe constitution of the medieval chapel choir remains obscure, but the choral foundation which [[Mary I of England|Mary Tudor]] established in 1553 (ten choristers, six [[lay clerk]]s, four priests, an organist, and a schoolmaster) survived essentially unchanged for over 300 years. Among the musicians associated with the choir during this time were the [[Tudor music|Tudor]] composers [[Thomas Preston (composer)|Thomas Preston]], [[Robert White (composer)|Robert White]] and [[John Hilton the elder]]; [[Robert Ramsey (composer)|Robert Ramsey]] was organist just before the [[English Commonwealth]];{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} the [[lute]]nist and writer [[Thomas Mace]] was a lay clerk for around 70 years from 1635;<ref>{{cite book |title=Life After Death: The Viola Da Gamba in Britain from Purcell to Dolmetsch |authorlink=Peter Holman |last=Holman |first=Peter |year=2010 |publisher=Boydell & Brewer |location=Woodbridge |pages=67\u201368 |isbn=978-1-84383-574-5 }}</ref> and [[Thomas Attwood Walmisley]] was organist in the early 19th century.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, shortly after [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] had graduated from Trinity and [[Alan Gray]] had succeeded [[Charles Villiers Stanford]] as Organist, the College choir school was closed down. Thereafter, a choir of boy trebles (holding scholarships at a local grammar school), lay clerks (some of whom shared their duties with the choirs of [[King's College, Cambridge|King's]] and [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's]] Colleges) and students continued the regular pattern of choral services until the 1950s. This traditionally-constituted body then gave way to a choir of undergraduate tenors and basses during [[Raymond Leppard]]'s tenure as Director of Music, to be replaced with a mixed choir by Richard Marlow in 1982.\n\n==Tours and Concerts ==\n\nThe choir has toured to destinations such as Australia, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, the United States, Canada, the Canary Islands, India, South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe, Peru, and Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Particularly notable events include singing mass at the installation of Abbot Martin Werlen, O.S.B. as Abbot of [[Einsiedeln, Switzerland]], and becoming the first western choir to tour India.\n\nThe choir also performs concerts in the UK, at home in Cambridge and in London ([[South Bank Centre]], [[St John's Smith Square]], [[Spitalfields Festival]]), and around the country. \u2018Livings tours\u2019 allow the choir to visit parishes around the country of which the college is patron and sing services and concerts; these include villages in the Isle of Wight, North Yorkshire, County Durham, Norfolk and the Lake District.\n\n==May Week ==\n\n[[File:cmglee_Cambridge_Singing_from_the_Towers_2013.jpg|thumb|250px|''Singing from the Towers'', 2013]]\n[[File:cmglee_Cambridge_Singing_on_the_River_2013.jpg|thumb|250px|''Singing on the River'', 2013]]\nOn the final Sunday of the academic year the Choir performs two outdoor concerts. At midday the choir sings [[antiphonally]] from two of the towers in the college's [[Trinity Great Court|Great Court]], with a brass ensemble performing from the third. In the evening the choir inaugurates [[May Week]] with the traditional River Concert, in which the [[madrigal]]s and [[part-song]]s are performed upon punts moored at Trinity Backs. The evening's entertainment concludes, as dusk gives way to darkness, with [[Wilbye]]'s madrigal ''Draw on, sweet night'' performed as the choir is punted down the river and out of sight.\n\n==Recordings ==\n===Under Richard Marlow===\n* Purcell: Anthems for the Chapel Royal (Conifer)\n* Poulenc - Sacred Choral Works (1988; Conifer)\n* Walton: Sacred Choral Music (1989; Conifer)\n* Carols from Trinity (1990; Conifer)\n* Glorious Trinity (1990; Conifer)\n* French Sacred Choral Works (1990; Classics)\n* Brahms: Complete Motets (1990; Classics)\n* Victoria: Tenebrae Responsories/Lamentations (1991; Conifer)\n* Sch\u00fctz: Psalmen Davids (1991; Conifer)\n* Monteverdi: Dixit Dominus (1992; Conifer)\n* Monteverdi - Motets  (1992; Classics)\n* Michael Haydn: Masses and Vespers (1993; Classics)\n* Great Is The Lord (1993; Conifer)\n* Miserere and Other Popular Choral Works (1993; Classics)\n* A Child Is Born (1993; Classics)\n* Carols from Trinity (1993; Conifer)\n* Voce: An Intimate Expression of Faith Offered By the Human Voice (1994; Brentwood Music, a compilation)\n* Weelkes/Tomkins - When David Heard (1994; Conifer)\n* Sweelinck: Pseaumes De David (1994; Conifer)\n* Bach: The Six Motets (1994; Conifer)\n* Lassus - Regina coeli and Seasonal Motets (1994; Conifer)\n* Praetorius - In dulci jubilo (1995; Conifer)\n* Gibbons - Hosanna to the Son of David (1995; Conifer)\n* The Songs of Angels (1996; Conifer)\n* Britten - Sacred and Profane (1996)\n* Bach Family Motets (1997; Conifer)\n* Carols from Trinity (1997; Conifer)\n* Choral Moods (1997; Conifer)\n* Descants from Trinity (1997; Conifer)\n* Sweelinck: Cantiones Sacrae, Vol.2 (1999; Hyperion)\n* Sweelinck: Cantiones Sacrae, Vol.1 (1999; Hyperion)\n* Hymns and Descants (2000; GMN)\n* A Trinity Christmas (2001; GMN)\n* Palestrina - Offertoria (2002; GMN)\n* Durufl\u00e9 - Complete Choral Works (2005; Chandos)\n* Mendelssohn - Sacred Choral Works (2006; Chandos)\n* Byrd - Cantiones sacrae (2007; Chandos)\n\n===Under Stephen Layton===\n* Handel - ''[[Dettingen Te Deum]]'' (2008; Hyperion) \n* Poulenc - Gloria & Motets (2008; Hyperion) \n* Lukaszewski - Choral Music (2008; Hyperion)\n* Handel - Chandos Anthems vol. 1 (2009; Hyperion) \n* Various - Baltic Exchange (2010; Hyperion)\n* Briggs - Messe de Notre Dame (2010; Hyperion)\n* American a cappella - Beyond all mortal dreams (2011; Hyperion)\n* Howells - Requiem & other choral works (2012; Hyperion)\n* Britten - A Ceremony of Carols & St Nicolas (2012; Hyperion)\n* Handel - Chandos Anthems vol. 2 (2013; Hyperion)\n* Bach - Christmas Oratorio (2013; Hyperion)\n* E\u0161envalds - Northern Lights & other choral works (2015; Hyperion)\n* Leighton - Crucifixus & other choral works (2015; Hyperion)\n* Various - Yulefest!

This provided dry home sites with access to the [[Charlotte Harbor (estuary)|Charlotte Harbor]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]].

His father was a [[Vicar (Anglicanism)|Church of England vicar]], and the family lived adjacent to the father's church \u2013 first in [[Ormond, Victoria|Ormond]], then later in [[Ashburton, Victoria|Ashburton]]. Harvey sang in the [[church choir]] from an early age.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.last.fm/music/Mick+Harvey/+wiki|title=Mick Harvey\u2019s Biography \u2014 Free listening, videos, concerts, stats and photos at Last.fm|website=Last.fm|accessdate=1 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nHarvey, his elder brother Philip, and younger brother Sebastian all attended the private boys' school [[Caulfield Grammar School]].

The band played at parties and school functions, with a repertoire of [[Lou Reed]], [[David Bowie]], [[Roxy Music]], [[Alice Cooper]] and the [[Sensational Alex Harvey Band]], among others. Harvey was also a member of the school choir (conducted by actor [[Norman Kaye]]), and took extracurricular lessons from [[Bruce Clarke (musician)|Bruce Clarke]], the [[jazz guitar]]ist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mickharvey.com/biography.php|title=Mick Harvey - Biography|website=www.mickharvey.com|accessdate=1 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115181727/http://www.mickharvey.com/biography.php|archive-date=15 November 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Music career==\n\n===The Birthday Party===\n{{Main|The Birthday Party (band)}}\nAfter their final school year in 1975, the band decided to continue with Pew as bassist. Greatly influenced by the [[punk rock|punk]] explosion of 1976, which saw Australian bands [[The Saints (Australian band)|The Saints]] and [[Radio Birdman]] make their first recordings and tours, [[The Birthday Party (band)#The Boys Next Door|The Boys Next Door]], as Harvey's band was now called, began performing fast, original [[New wave music|new wave]] material.<ref>[https://www.discogs.com/artist/78466-The-Boys-Next-Door Discogs - ''The Boys Next Door'' - Aliases, Members, Discography]</ref> Harvey's guitar style was influenced by [[James Williamson (musician)|James Williamson]] of [[The Stooges]] and [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]] of [[The Jam]]. The Boys Next Door regularly played at Melbourne pubs between 1977 and 1980. [[Rowland S. Howard]] joined the band in 1978, bringing with him a chaotic [[audio feedback|feedback]] guitar style.\n\nAfter extensive touring, recordings, and moderate success in Australia, the Boys Next Door relocated to [[London]], England in 1980, and changed their name to The Birthday Party. Harvey's girlfriend Katy Beale followed the band to London. This period was defined by innovative and aggressive music composition, underpinned by Harvey's guitar playing. The band moved to [[West Berlin]], Germany in 1982, but without Calvert; Harvey transitioned from guitar to drums.\n\n===Crime and the City Solution===\n''Main article: [[Crime & the City Solution]]''\n\nAfter the breakup of The Birthday Party while initiating the early recordings of what would become The Bad Seeds with Nick Cave, Harvey contacted his friend [[Simon Bonney]], with whom he reformed Bonney's old Australian band [[Crime & the City Solution]]. Rowland S. Howard, [[Harry Howard (musician)|Harry Howard]] (bass) and Epic Soundtracks (drums), all of whom a few years later would form the basis of [[These Immortal Souls]], also participated. This line-up of the band found its peak and demise with its appearance in the [[Wim Wenders]] film [[Wings of Desire]]. Bonney then stayed in Berlin and formed the next line-up of the band with his partner [[Bronwyn Adams]], Harvey (drums), [[Alexander Hacke]] of [[Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten]] (guitar), [[Chrislo Haas]] of [[Liaisons Dangereuses (band)|Liaisons Dangereuses]] and DAF (synthesiser) and Thomas Stern (bass). This line-up made 3 studio albums and toured until 1991.\n\n=== Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds ===\n''Main article: [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]]''\n\nHarvey and Cave formed Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds in 1983. Harvey was principally the drummer on the first 2 albums before line-up changes saw him move to the bass until the arrival of [[Martyn P. Casey]] in 1990 when he moved back to his original instrument, guitar. Throughout the 80s and 90 Harvey was the band member charged with the responsibility for the production of the recordings along with Cave. His arrangement skills also saw him putting together most of the band\u2019s string arrangements during this time and led to the perception of him as a kind of musical director. He also managed much of the band\u2019s business affairs right up until his departure. Harvey remained with the Bad Seeds for 25 years until his last show in Perth, Australia on 20 January 2009, when he cited both professional and personal factors as reasons for leaving.<sup>[5]</sup> Regarding Cave, Harvey informed the media: <blockquote>\nI'm confident Nick [Cave] will continue to be a creative force and that this is the right time to pass on my artistic and managerial role to what has become a tremendous group of people who can support him in his endeavours, both musically and organisationally.<ref name=\"Quit\">{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/01/22/2472215.htm?section=entertainment|title=Bad Seeds co-founder Harvey quits|date=23 January 2009|work=ABC News|accessdate=28 August 2014}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 2010, Harvey explained further that his frustration with song arrangements strained his relationship with Cave; and a desire to spend time with family was also a significant reason for his decision. The split marked the end of a 36-year-long collaboration between Harvey and Cave.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://meltingpod.free.fr/?p=214|title=Podcast 103 Live interview with Mick Harvey in Paris 2010 : some reasons to have left the band Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds\u2026Part 2 (25\u2032)|author1=Mardi|date=2 March 2010|website=Meltingpod|publisher=Meltingpod|format=Audio file|accessdate=28 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== '''Anita Lane''' ===\n''Main article: [[Anita Lane]]''\n\nHarvey worked extensively with Nick Cave\u2019s muse and partner of many years on two albums - Dirty Pearl (1993 ) and Sex O\u2019Clock (200)\n\n===The Wallbangers===\nIn 2007, the Spanish label [[Bang!

He has also collaborated with UK rock musician [[PJ Harvey]] (no relation), and produced for other Australian artists, including [[Anita Lane]], [[Robert Forster (musician)|Robert Forster]], [[Conway Savage]] and Rowland S. Howard. Harvey's third solo release, ''[[One Man's Treasure]]'', was issued in September 2005.\n\nHe undertook his first solo tours of Europe and Australia in 2006, accompanied by fellow Bad Seeds [[Thomas Wydler]] and [[James Johnston (English musician)|James Johnston]], as well as Melbourne-based double bassist Rosie Westbrook. His next solo record, 2007's ''Two of Diamonds'', was recorded with this group, as was the 2008 live album ''Three Sisters \u2013 Live at Bush Hall''.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nIn February 2008, Harvey and Westbrook played as a support act for PJ Harvey on her Australian tour, with both Harveys also performing on stage together. Prior to the tour, Harvey had worked extensively with PJ Harvey over a 12-year period: he was a recording musician on her albums ''[[To Bring You My Love]]'' and ''[[Is This Desire?]]'', and co-produced the album ''[[Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea]]'' in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Melbjuz|title=PJ chooses Mick Harvey|url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/11857/PJ-chooses-Mick-Harvey|website=Faster Louder|publisher=Faster Louder Pty Ltd|accessdate=28 August 2014|date=10 January 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903173411/http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/11857/PJ-chooses-Mick-Harvey|archive-date=3 September 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n[[File:Mickey_Harvey_2012.jpg|thumb|right|Harvey, 2012]]\nIn both 2008 and 2009, he joined the five remaining members of [[The Triffids]] for a series of performances at the [[Sydney Festival]], [[Melbourne Arts Centre]] and [[Perth International Arts Festival]], celebrating the music and the memory of [[David McComb]]. Harvey is also a contributor to the 2009 edited collection, ''Vagabond Holes: David McComb and the Triffids'', edited by Australian academics [[Niall Lucy]] and Chris Coughran.<ref>Niall Lucy and Chris Coughran, eds. Vagabond Holes: David McComb and The Triffids (Fremantle: Fremantle Press, 2009).</ref>\n\nDuring 2008 and 2009 Harvey worked on what would be [[Rowland S. Howard]]\u2019s last album \u2018Pop Crimes\u2019 playing drums with his future close collaborator J.P. Shilo providing bass and violin. The album was released just a few months before Howard succumbed to liver cancer in late 2009.\n\nHarvey released ''Sketches from the Book of the Dead'' \u2014 the first solo album written entirely by himself \u2014 in early 2011 on the Mute record label. The 11-track album was recorded in Melbourne, between a Port Melbourne studio and his own Grace Lane music room. Harvey played most of the instruments, while Westbrook played double bass, J.P. Shilo played accordion, violin and occasional guitar, and Xanthe Waite contributed backing vocals. Harvey explained in a promotional interview that he does not perceive himself as a \"songwriter\" in the traditional sense, whereby the practice is: \"something they [actual songwriters, as perceived by Harvey] have done historically and something they've worked on as central to what they are as an artist\". He also confirmed that the opening track, \"October Boy\", is about Rowland S. Howard.<ref name=\"Ian\">{{cite web|author1=Ian Johnston|title=Mick Harvey \u2013 Exclusive LTW Review/Interview|url=http://louderthanwar.com/mick-harvey-exclusive-ltw-reviewinterview/|website=Louder Than War|publisher=Louder Than War|accessdate=28 August 2014|date=12 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nHarvey once again co-produced and recorded for PJ Harvey during the creation of her eighth studio album, ''[[Let England Shake]]''. The 2011 release was supported by a world tour in the same year, which also included Harvey as a touring musician.<ref name=\"Ian\" />\n\nHis sixth solo studio album, titled ''FOUR (Acts of Love)'', released on Mute in 2013, features original compositions by Mick Harvey alongside a song by PJ Harvey (\"Glorious\") and interpretations of The Saints\u2019 \"The Story of Love\", [[Van Morrison]]\u2019s \"The Way Young Lovers Do\", Exuma\u2019s \"Summertime in New York\" and [[Roy Orbison]]\u2019s \"Wild Hearts (Run Out of Time)\". ''FOUR (Acts of Love)'' was recorded at Grace Lane, North Melbourne and Atlantis Sound, Melbourne, and features regular collaborators Rosie Westbrook on double bass and JP Shilo on guitar and violin.\n\n''Delirium Tremens'' (2016) is the third instalment in Harvey's project of translating [[Serge Gainsbourg]]'s songs into English, after ''Intoxicated Man'' and ''Pink Elephants''. ''Delirium Tremens'' was recorded in Melbourne with Harvey's Antipodean-based core live band. 10 songs were tracked at Birdland Studios; the project then relocated to Berlin, where a further nine songs were recorded with [[Toby Dammit]] ([[The Stooges]], The Residents) and Bertrand Burgalat (of French label Tricatel), who was the string arranger on the first two volumes.\n\nHarvey again collaborated with PJ Harvey in early 2015, playing and singing on her album ''[[The Hope Six Demolition Project]]''. The following year he joined PJ on tour promoting the album, which was released in April 2016.\n\nIn 2018, Harvey released the album ''The Fall And Rise Of Edgar Bourchier And The Horrors Of War'' in collaboration with author [https://eleganthorrors.co.uk Christopher Richard Barker].\n\n==Personal life==\nHarvey divides his time between Europe and Melbourne. He has one son with his partner, Katy Beale, who is a painter. As of 2014, the family resided in the inner-city Melbourne suburb of North Melbourne.<ref name=\"Talk\" />\n\nAs part of his interview with [[Brisbane]] writer [[Andrew McMillen]] for the book ''Talking Smack: Honest Conversations About Drugs'', Harvey concluded with his perspective on illicit drug use:\n\n<blockquote>\nBecause I\u2019ve been so surrounded by [illicit drug use], I've seen a lot of the problems that come with it.

A multi-instrumentalist, he is best known for his long-term collaborations with [[Nick Cave]], with whom he formed [[The Birthday Party (band)#Early years and The Boys Next Door (1973\u20131978)|The Boys Next Door]], [[The Birthday Party (band)|The Birthday Party]] and [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]].\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in [[Rochester, Victoria]], Australia, Harvey moved to the suburbs of [[Melbourne]] in his childhood. His father was a [[Vicar (Anglicanism)|Church of England vicar]], and the family lived adjacent to the father's church \u2013 first in [[Ormond, Victoria|Ormond]], then later in [[Ashburton, Victoria|Ashburton]]. Harvey sang in the [[church choir]] from an early age.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.last.fm/music/Mick+Harvey/+wiki|title=Mick Harvey\u2019s Biography \u2014 Free listening, videos, concerts, stats and photos at Last.fm|website=Last.fm|accessdate=1 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nHarvey, his elder brother Philip, and younger brother Sebastian all attended the private boys' school [[Caulfield Grammar School]]. It was at school in the early 1970s that Harvey met fellow students Cave and [[Phill Calvert]], as well as [[Tracy Pew]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/feb/23/popandrock.features|title=Interview with Nick Cave|first=Interview by Simon|last=Hattenstone|date=23 February 2008|publisher=|accessdate=1 December 2017|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> A rock group was formed with Cave (vocals), Harvey (guitar), Calvert (drums), and other students on guitar, bass and saxophone. The band played at parties and school functions, with a repertoire of [[Lou Reed]], [[David Bowie]], [[Roxy Music]], [[Alice Cooper]] and the [[Sensational Alex Harvey Band]], among others. Harvey was also a member of the school choir (conducted by actor [[Norman Kaye]]), and took extracurricular lessons from [[Bruce Clarke (musician)|Bruce Clarke]], the [[jazz guitar]]ist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mickharvey.com/biography.php|title=Mick Harvey - Biography|website=www.mickharvey.com|accessdate=1 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115181727/http://www.mickharvey.com/biography.php|archive-date=15 November 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Music career==\n\n===The Birthday Party===\n{{Main|The Birthday Party (band)}}\nAfter their final school year in 1975, the band decided to continue with Pew as bassist. Greatly influenced by the [[punk rock|punk]] explosion of 1976, which saw Australian bands [[The Saints (Australian band)|The Saints]] and [[Radio Birdman]] make their first recordings and tours, [[The Birthday Party (band)#The Boys Next Door|The Boys Next Door]], as Harvey's band was now called, began performing fast, original [[New wave music|new wave]] material.<ref>[https://www.discogs.com/artist/78466-The-Boys-Next-Door Discogs - ''The Boys Next Door'' - Aliases, Members, Discography]</ref> Harvey's guitar style was influenced by [[James Williamson (musician)|James Williamson]] of [[The Stooges]] and [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]] of [[The Jam]]. The Boys Next Door regularly played at Melbourne pubs between 1977 and 1980. [[Rowland S. Howard]] joined the band in 1978, bringing with him a chaotic [[audio feedback|feedback]] guitar style.\n\nAfter extensive touring, recordings, and moderate success in Australia, the Boys Next Door relocated to [[London]], England in 1980, and changed their name to The Birthday Party. Harvey's girlfriend Katy Beale followed the band to London. This period was defined by innovative and aggressive music composition, underpinned by Harvey's guitar playing. The band moved to [[West Berlin]], Germany in 1982, but without Calvert; Harvey transitioned from guitar to drums.\n\n===Crime and the City Solution===\n''Main article: [[Crime & the City Solution]]''\n\nAfter the breakup of The Birthday Party while initiating the early recordings of what would become The Bad Seeds with Nick Cave, Harvey contacted his friend [[Simon Bonney]], with whom he reformed Bonney's old Australian band [[Crime & the City Solution]]. Rowland S. Howard, [[Harry Howard (musician)|Harry Howard]] (bass) and Epic Soundtracks (drums), all of whom a few years later would form the basis of [[These Immortal Souls]], also participated. This line-up of the band found its peak and demise with its appearance in the [[Wim Wenders]] film [[Wings of Desire]]. Bonney then stayed in Berlin and formed the next line-up of the band with his partner [[Bronwyn Adams]], Harvey (drums), [[Alexander Hacke]] of [[Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten]] (guitar), [[Chrislo Haas]] of [[Liaisons Dangereuses (band)|Liaisons Dangereuses]] and DAF (synthesiser) and Thomas Stern (bass). This line-up made 3 studio albums and toured until 1991.\n\n=== Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds ===\n''Main article: [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]]''\n\nHarvey and Cave formed Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds in 1983. Harvey was principally the drummer on the first 2 albums before line-up changes saw him move to the bass until the arrival of [[Martyn P. Casey]] in 1990 when he moved back to his original instrument, guitar. Throughout the 80s and 90 Harvey was the band member charged with the responsibility for the production of the recordings along with Cave. His arrangement skills also saw him putting together most of the band\u2019s string arrangements during this time and led to the perception of him as a kind of musical director. He also managed much of the band\u2019s business affairs right up until his departure. Harvey remained with the Bad Seeds for 25 years until his last show in Perth, Australia on 20 January 2009, when he cited both professional and personal factors as reasons for leaving.<sup>[5]</sup> Regarding Cave, Harvey informed the media: <blockquote>\nI'm confident Nick [Cave] will continue to be a creative force and that this is the right time to pass on my artistic and managerial role to what has become a tremendous group of people who can support him in his endeavours, both musically and organisationally.<ref name=\"Quit\">{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/01/22/2472215.htm?section=entertainment|title=Bad Seeds co-founder Harvey quits|date=23 January 2009|work=ABC News|accessdate=28 August 2014}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 2010, Harvey explained further that his frustration with song arrangements strained his relationship with Cave; and a desire to spend time with family was also a significant reason for his decision. The split marked the end of a 36-year-long collaboration between Harvey and Cave.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://meltingpod.free.fr/?p=214|title=Podcast 103 Live interview with Mick Harvey in Paris 2010 : some reasons to have left the band Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds\u2026Part 2 (25\u2032)|author1=Mardi|date=2 March 2010|website=Meltingpod|publisher=Meltingpod|format=Audio file|accessdate=28 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== '''Anita Lane''' ===\n''Main article: [[Anita Lane]]''\n\nHarvey worked extensively with Nick Cave\u2019s muse and partner of many years on two albums - Dirty Pearl (1993 ) and Sex O\u2019Clock (200)\n\n===The Wallbangers===\nIn 2007, the Spanish label [[Bang! Records]] released a four-track [[Extended play|EP]] by Harvey's [[retro]] rock band The Wallbangers, called ''Kick the Drugs'' <ref>[https://www.discogs.com/release/3327901 Discogs - ''Kick the Drugs'' - vinyl 7\", Bang! Records (BANG!-21) Spain]</ref> featuring songs written by Harvey alone, and songs he co-wote with [[Tex Perkins]] and [[Loene Carmen]]. Harvey sings and plays guitars, while drums are credited to \"Rocky Features\" (a Harvey pseudonym) and bass to \"Rod Bottoms\".<ref>[https://www.discogs.com/release/3465235-Kick-The-Drugs/images Discogs - ''Kick the Drugs'' (images) - CD, Spooky Records (Spooky 030) Australia]</ref> A press release stated the EP was Rocky Features' first recording since 1982's ''[[Honeymoon in Red]]'', which was released with pseudonymous credits for Harvey's contributions (but not the pseudonym Rocky Features).\n\n===Solo===\nAfter Bonney left Crime & the City Solution for a solo career in the United States, Harvey recorded two solo albums of [[Serge Gainsbourg]] songs, translated from French into English: ''[[Intoxicated Man]]'' (1995) and ''[[Pink Elephants]]'' (1997). He has also collaborated with UK rock musician [[PJ Harvey]] (no relation), and produced for other Australian artists, including [[Anita Lane]], [[Robert Forster (musician)|Robert Forster]], [[Conway Savage]] and Rowland S. Howard. Harvey's third solo release, ''[[One Man's Treasure]]'', was issued in September 2005.\n\nHe undertook his first solo tours of Europe and Australia in 2006, accompanied by fellow Bad Seeds [[Thomas Wydler]] and [[James Johnston (English musician)|James Johnston]], as well as Melbourne-based double bassist Rosie Westbrook. His next solo record, 2007's ''Two of Diamonds'', was recorded with this group, as was the 2008 live album ''Three Sisters \u2013 Live at Bush Hall''.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nDuring 2008 and 2009 Harvey worked on what would be [[Rowland S. Howard]]\u2019s last album \u2018Pop Crimes\u2019 playing drums with his future close collaborator J.P. Shilo providing bass and violin. The album was released just a few months before Howard succumbed to liver cancer in late 2009.\n\nIn February 2008, Harvey and Westbrook played as a support act for PJ Harvey on her Australian tour, with both Harveys also performing on stage together. Prior to the tour, Harvey had worked extensively with PJ Harvey over a 12-year period: he was a recording musician on her albums ''[[To Bring You My Love]]'' and ''[[Is This Desire?]]'', and co-produced the album ''[[Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea]]'' in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Melbjuz|title=PJ chooses Mick Harvey|url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/11857/PJ-chooses-Mick-Harvey|website=Faster Louder|publisher=Faster Louder Pty Ltd|accessdate=28 August 2014|date=10 January 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903173411/http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/11857/PJ-chooses-Mick-Harvey|archive-date=3 September 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n[[File:Mickey_Harvey_2012.jpg|thumb|right|Harvey, 2012]]\nIn both 2008 and 2009, he joined the five remaining members of [[The Triffids]] for a series of performances at the [[Sydney Festival]], [[Melbourne Arts Centre]] and [[Perth International Arts Festival]], celebrating the music and the memory of [[David McComb]]. Harvey is also a contributor to the 2009 edited collection, ''Vagabond Holes: David McComb and the Triffids'', edited by Australian academics [[Niall Lucy]] and Chris Coughran.<ref>Niall Lucy and Chris Coughran, eds.

The 11-track album was recorded in Melbourne, between a Port Melbourne studio and his own Grace Lane music room. Harvey played most of the instruments, while Westbrook played double bass, J.P. Shilo played accordion, violin and occasional guitar, and Xanthe Waite contributed backing vocals. Harvey explained in a promotional interview that he does not perceive himself as a \"songwriter\" in the traditional sense, whereby the practice is: \"something they [actual songwriters, as perceived by Harvey] have done historically and something they've worked on as central to what they are as an artist\". He also confirmed that the opening track, \"October Boy\", is about Rowland S. Howard.<ref name=\"Ian\">{{cite web|author1=Ian Johnston|title=Mick Harvey \u2013 Exclusive LTW Review/Interview|url=http://louderthanwar.com/mick-harvey-exclusive-ltw-reviewinterview/|website=Louder Than War|publisher=Louder Than War|accessdate=28 August 2014|date=12 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nHarvey once again co-produced and recorded for PJ Harvey during the creation of her eighth studio album, ''[[Let England Shake]]''. The 2011 release was supported by a world tour in the same year, which also included Harvey as a touring musician.<ref name=\"Ian\" />\n\nHis sixth solo studio album, titled ''FOUR (Acts of Love)'', released on Mute in 2013, features original compositions by Mick Harvey alongside a song by PJ Harvey (\"Glorious\") and interpretations of The Saints\u2019 \"The Story of Love\", [[Van Morrison]]\u2019s \"The Way Young Lovers Do\", Exuma\u2019s \"Summertime in New York\" and [[Roy Orbison]]\u2019s \"Wild Hearts (Run Out of Time)\". ''FOUR (Acts of Love)'' was recorded at Grace Lane, North Melbourne and Atlantis Sound, Melbourne, and features regular collaborators Rosie Westbrook on double bass and JP Shilo on guitar and violin.\n\n''Delirium Tremens'' (2016) is the third instalment in Harvey's project of translating [[Serge Gainsbourg]]'s songs into English, after ''Intoxicated Man'' and ''Pink Elephants''. ''Delirium Tremens'' was recorded in Melbourne with Harvey's Antipodean-based core live band. 10 songs were tracked at Birdland Studios; the project then relocated to Berlin, where a further nine songs were recorded with [[Toby Dammit]] ([[The Stooges]], The Residents) and Bertrand Burgalat (of French label Tricatel), who was the string arranger on the first two volumes.\n\nHarvey again collaborated with PJ Harvey in early 2015, playing and singing on her album ''[[The Hope Six Demolition Project]]''. The following year he joined PJ on tour promoting the album, which was released in April 2016.\n\nIn 2018, Harvey released the album ''The Fall And Rise Of Edgar Bourchier And The Horrors Of War'' in collaboration with author [https://eleganthorrors.co.uk Christopher Richard Barker].\n\n==Personal life==\nHarvey divides his time between Europe and Melbourne. He has one son with his partner, Katy Beale, who is a painter. As of 2014, the family resided in the inner-city Melbourne suburb of North Melbourne.<ref name=\"Talk\" />\n\nAs part of his interview with [[Brisbane]] writer [[Andrew McMillen]] for the book ''Talking Smack: Honest Conversations About Drugs'', Harvey concluded with his perspective on illicit drug use:\n\n<blockquote>\nBecause I\u2019ve been so surrounded by [illicit drug use], I've seen a lot of the problems that come with it. But I've also seen a lot of people, as well, who've used in different ways and not had problems.
