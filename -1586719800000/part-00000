He served as [[List of Prime Ministers of Hungary|Prime Minister]] between 1 and 16 November 1918 and as [[List of heads of state of Hungary|President]] between 16 November 1918 and 21 March 1919. \n\n==Background and early career==\n\n\n[[File:Karolyiyoung.jpg|thumb|left|Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi in [[Franzensbad]] around 1887.]]\n\n\n\n\n===Early life===\n\nThe K\u00e1rolyi family were an illustrious, extremely wealthy, [[Roman Catholic]] aristocratic family who had played an important role in Hungarian life since the 17th century.\nMih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi was born on March 4, 1875, in the K\u00e1rolyi Palace in the aristocratic palace district of Pest. K\u00e1rolyi, born of a cousin's marriage, thus born with a severe malformation: [[Cleft lip and cleft palate]], and his illness deeply determined his entire childhood and personality development. Her mother died early in Tuberculosis and her father soon remarried. Mih\u00e1ly was considered unsuitable for a more serious career by his father, because he was incapable of normal speech training. Mih\u00e1ly was raised with great devotion by his maternal grandmother.\n\nHe was raised with overcare with his older sister in the Castle of his grandmother at F\u00f3t, because Count Julius K\u00e1rolyi,  the politician father had not enough time for Mih\u00e1ly. At the age of 14, his grandmother sent him to a Viennese clinic and he underwent a special surgery to restore his palate and mouth. [7] The surgery proved to be a sharp turning point: After some weeks Mih\u00e1ly started to speak quickly, fluently and very elaborately, despite the family and relatives formerly thought that he is too dumb to speak. By this time, he was a relatively superficial aristocrat, but his knowledge and awareness was below that of his contemporaries. His thinking and character were shaped by extracurricular influences: the hatred towards the Habsburg dynasty, the traditional anti-German sentiment of his family, his foster father, the world-view of S\u00e1ndor K\u00e1rolyi in the 1848 revolution, his idea of organizing peasants into farming cooperatives. Based on his reading experiences, including the French Encyclop\u00e9die and Jules Verne novels, he developed an idealistic devotion to the cause of world justice, unbroken optimistic faith in the fast development of science and technology, which will solve all problems of humankind. He was not interested in university lectures, he managed to pass his exams with the help of a tutor. Nevertheless, he obtained his law degree and, at the age of 24, became a rampant adult. He wanted to make up for what he had missed as a teenager, throwing himself into the nightlife, with striking vehemence; he spent his time ruthlessly, playing cards, having fun in hunting, living in French spa towns, attended many international horse races and early automobile racings in various European countries. HE became a passionate collector of racecars. Known for his card battles, his lone card losses and his \"dandy\" lifestyle in famous casinos across Western Europe.  The young tycoon begins to get serious and turn to politics and public life.\n\n<center>\n<gallery>\nFile:F\u00f3ti K\u00e1rolyi-kast\u00e9ly.jpg|thumb|One of his grandmother's castle complex of F\u00f3t, where Mih\u00e1ly grew up\nFile:Fehervarcsurgo kastelycivertanlegi4.jpg|thumb|Feh\u00e9rv\u00e1rcsurg\u00f3 Castle\nFile:Nagym\u00e1gocs - Palace.jpg|thumb|Nagym\u00e1gocs - Palace\nFile:CivertanlegifotoFuzerradvany2.jpg|thumb|F\u00fcz\u00e9rradv\u00e1ny Castle\nFile:K\u00e1rolyi-palota, Budapest.jpg|thumb|K\u00e1rolyi-palota, Budapest downtown\nFile:K\u00e1rolyi-kast\u00e9ly (Kast\u00e9lyhotel Sasv\u00e1r) (5819. sz\u00e1m\u00fa m\u0171eml\u00e9k).jpg|Par\u00e1dsasv\u00e1r Castle\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n====Early Political career ====\n\nIn his youth, he was a wastrel, but as he grew older, he became devoted to more serious pursuits. In 1909, he became the President of the OMGE (National Agricultural Society), the main rural organization of the nobility. Initially a supporter of the existing political and social system in Hungary, K\u00e1rolyi gradually became more progressive and [[left-wing]] during his career.\n\nIn 1910, K\u00e1rolyi was elected to Parliament as a member of the opposition Party of Independence.\n\nIn January 1913, he was challenged to a duel by prime minister [[Istv\u00e1n Tisza]], after refusing to shake Tisza's hand following a political disagreement.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=1913: The Defiant Swan Song|last=Cowles|first=Virginia|publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson|year=1967|isbn=|location=London|pages=157-158|url-status=live}}</ref> The 34-bout duel with cavalry sabres lasted an hour until Tisza cut K\u00e1rolyi's arm and the seconds ended the duel.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== World War I, political campaign for the Allied Powers===\nDuring the [[First World War]], the pro-Entente K\u00e1rolyi led a small but very active pacifist anti-war maverick fraction in the Hungarian parliament.<ref>{{cite book|author1=[[Robert Paxton]]|author2=Julie Hessler|title=Europe in the Twentieth Century|publisher=[[CEngage Learning]]|year=2011|page=129|ISBN=9780495913191|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M5wTncOaHEQC&pg=PA129&dq=%22mih%C3%A1ly+k%C3%A1rolyi%22+pacifist+party&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiN0YqCj_3YAhVJPRQKHb_YDCIQ6AEIRTAG#v=onepage&q=%22mih%C3%A1ly%20k%C3%A1rolyi%22&f=false}}</ref> K\u00e1rolyi made contact with British and French Entente diplomats behind the scenes in Switzerland during the war.<ref>{{cite book|author=Deborah S.

K\u00e1rolyi argued for peace with the Allies, looser ties between Austria and Hungary, abolishing the property-based franchise requirements that allowed only 5.8% of the population to vote and run for office before the war, and giving women the right to vote and hold office. In particular, K\u00e1rolyi's demand in 1915 that veterans should be granted the right to vote won so much popular support that enraged the Prime Minister, Count [[Istv\u00e1n Tisza]].  In 1916 K\u00e1rolyi broke off with his party, which had found his openly pro-Entente attitude to be too radical and dangerous for a war-time pacifist fraction in the parliament. Therefore K\u00e1rolyi formed a new party, called the United Party of Independence and of 1848, and generally known as the '''K\u00e1rolyi Party'''.\n\nIn January 1918, K\u00e1rolyi proclaimed himself a follower of [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s [[Fourteen Points]].\n\n==Marriage and family ==\nOn 7 November 1914 in [[Budapest]], K\u00e1rolyi married Countess Katalin Andr\u00e1ssy de Cs\u00edkszentkir\u00e1ly et Krasznahorka, with whom he had three children. K\u00e1rolyi's wife was a member of one of Hungary's most powerful families, and this marriage won K\u00e1rolyi the protection of his influential father-in-law.\n\n==Leading the Democratic Republic==\n\nFollowing the [[Aster Revolution]] of October 1918, K\u00e1rolyi became leader of the nation. On 25 October 1918 K\u00e1rolyi had formed an opposition National Council. His reputation as an opponent of the much-hated war had thrust him into a role for which he was not suited.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} King-Emperor [[Karl I of Austria|Charles IV]] designated him as Prime Minister as a part of a desperate attempt to hold Hungary on to the [[Habsburgs]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} K\u00e1rolyi would have preferred to keep the monarchy and some link to [[Austria]] if possible. Only after Charles's withdrawal from government on 16 November 1918 made K\u00e1rolyi proclaim the [[Hungarian Democratic Republic]], with himself as Provisional President. On 11 January 1919 the National Council formally recognized him as President.\n\nThe [[Royal Hungarian Honv\u00e9d|Hungarian Royal Honv\u00e9d army]] still had more than 1,400,000 soldiers<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Martin Kitchen]]|title=Europe Between the Wars|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2014|page=190|ISBN=9781317867531|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=36WsAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA190}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Ign\u00e1c Romsics|title=Dismantling of Historic Hungary: The Peace Treaty of Trianon, 1920 Issue 3 of CHSP Hungarian authors series East European monographs|publisher=Social Science Monographs|year=2002|page=62|ISBN=9780880335058}}</ref> when Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi was announced as prime minister of Hungary.

The Hungarian self-disarmament made the occupation of Hungary directly possible for the relatively small armies of Romania, the Franco-Serbian army and the armed forces of the newly established Czechoslovakia. During the rule of K\u00e1rolyi's pacifist cabinet, Hungary lost control over approx. 75% of its former pre-WW1 territories (325 411&nbsp;km\u00b2) without armed resistance and was subject to foreign occupation.\n\nMilitary and political events changed rapidly and drastically after the Hungarian disarmament. On 5 November 1918, the Serbian army, with the help of the French army, crossed southern borders. On 8 November, the Czechoslovak Army crossed the northern borders, and on 13 November, the Romanian army crossed the eastern borders of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. On 13 November, K\u00e1rolyi signed an [[armistice]] with the Allied nations in [[Belgrade]]. It limited the size of the Hungarian army to six infantry and two cavalry divisions.<ref>Krizman B.

Under the terms of the armistice, Serbian and French troops advanced from the south, taking control of the [[Banat]] and Croatia. Czechoslovakia took control of [[Upper Hungary]] and [[Carpathian Ruthenia]]. Romanian forces were permitted to advance to the [[Mure\u0219 river|River Maros (Mure\u0219)]] .

K\u00e1rolyi ruled Hungary through a National Council, transformed into the government that consisted of his party in alliance with the large [[Hungarian Social Democratic Party]] and the small Civic Radical Party led by [[Oszk\u00e1r J\u00e1szi]].\n\nAt the same time, there existed various revolutionary councils, which were dominated by the Social Democrats, which were not unlike the ''[[Soviet Union|Soviet]]s'' (Councils) that existed in [[Russia]] in 1917.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}  This situation of [[Dual Power]] gave K\u00e1rolyi responsibility without much power while giving the Social Democrats power without much responsibility.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n[[File:Mihaly-karolyi-II--outlawsdiary00tormuoft.png|thumb|250px|left|Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi in a speech]]\nDuring their brief periods in power, K\u00e1rolyi and J\u00e1szi, who served as Nationalities Minister, tried to create an \"Eastern Switzerland\" by persuading the non-Magyar peoples of Hungary to stay as part of the new Hungarian Democratic Republic.\n\nAdditional trouble for the new government occurred over the question of the armistice. [[Austria-Hungary]] had signed the lenient [[Armistice of villa Giusti]] (close to [[Padua]], [[Italy]]) with the Allies on 3 November 1918. Since Hungary was now independent, some in the Cabinet argued that Hungary needed to sign a new armistice.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Against his better judgement, K\u00e1rolyi agreed to this idea,{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} and had Hungary sign in November 1918, a new armistice with the Allies in [[Belgrade]] with the Allied Commander in the Balkans, the French General [[Louis Franchet d'Esperey]].\n\nGeneral Franchet d'Esperey treated the Hungarians with open contempt and imposed a much harsher armistice on the defeated nation than the Padua Armistice had.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} This was the source of much criticism of K\u00e1rolyi, who had been expected \u2013 and who himself expected \u2013 the Allies to treat Hungary as a friend, not an enemy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Moreover, K\u00e1rolyi's opponents argued that by needlessly seeking a second armistice, K\u00e1rolyi had worsened Hungary's situation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nFurthermore, the Social Democrats who were Hungary's largest party by far, frequently undercut K\u00e1rolyi and imposed their decisions on him without taking responsibility for their actions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} K\u00e1rolyi wished to transfer almost all of the rural lands to the peasants.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} To set an example, he gave all of his own vast family estates to his tenants. But this was the only land transfer that took place; the Social Democrats blocked any measures that might give the control of those lands to the peasantry on the grounds that it was promoting capitalism. {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n[[File:Mihaly-karolyi-reparto-tierras--outlawsdiary00tormuoft.png|thumb|250px|right|Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi distributing his lands among the peasants.]]\nIn another equally unfortunate move, the pacific-minded K\u00e1rolyi had abolished almost all the Hungarian armed forces in November 1918.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} All through the winter of 1918\u201319, the [[Romanians]], the [[Yugoslavs]] and the Czechoslovaks often broke the armistice in order to seize more territory for themselves. After January 1919, K\u00e1rolyi ordered the build-up of a Hungarian army and started to consider the idea of an alliance with Soviet Russia, through K\u00e1rolyi was opposed to the idea of Communism in Hungary itself.\n\nIn addition, as Hungary had signed an armistice, not a peace treaty, the Allied blockade continued until such time as a peace treaty was signed. Hungary had suffered from food shortages throughout the war and deaths from starvation had become common from 1917 onwards. Furthermore,  the country had been overwhelmed with refugees from [[Transylvania]] and [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]].\n\nMaking things worse was the creation of [[Czechoslovakia]] which had cut Hungary off from supplies of German [[coal]]. Hungary which possessed little coal depended upon German coal imports. Without coal, most had to live without heat in the winter of 1918\u201319, and the railroad network had gradually ceased to function. The collapse of railroads in their turn caused the collapse of industry and hence mass [[unemployment]].\n\nMaking things even worse was the economic incompetence of the government which printed more and more money, leading to massive [[inflation]] and even more impoverishment. K\u00e1rolyi's failure to improve living conditions or persuade the Allies to lift the blockade led to public criticism of K\u00e1rolyi.\n\nBaron [[Lajos Hatvany]] described K\u00e1rolyi's leadership well when he noted \"From the discussions no decisions arose, and from the decisions \u2013 no actions.

No, it was a debating club\".<ref>Vermes, Gabor \"The October Revolution In Hungary\" from ''Hungary in Revolution'' edited by Ivan Volgyes Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1971 page 49.</ref> In the same vein, the British writer [[Harold Nicolson]], who had known K\u00e1rolyi during his exile in Britain, when reviewing K\u00e1rolyi's memoirs in 1957 noted that: \"he had many qualities, but unfortunately lacked those for which a man is taken seriously by serious people\".<ref>Menczer, Bela \"Bela Kun and the Hungarian Revolution of 1919\" pages 299\u2013309 Volume XIX, Issue #5, May 1969, History Today Inc: London page 301.</ref>\n\n[[Sigmund Freud]], the Austrian psychologist&mdash;who had known the two politicians personally&mdash;wrote about the assassination of [[Istv\u00e1n Tisza]] and the appointment of Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi as new prime minister of Hungary:\n\n{{Quotation| \n\"I was certainly no adherent of the ancien regime, but it seems doubtful to me whether it is a sign of political shrewdness to beat to death the smartest of the many counts [Count Istvan Tisza] and to make the stupidest one [Count Mihaly Karolyi] president.\" <ref>{{cite book|author1=Sigmund Freud |author2=S\u00e1ndor Ferenczi |author3=Eva Brabant |author4=Ernst Falzeder |author5=Patrizia Giampieri-Deutsch |title=The Correspondence of Sigmund Freud and S\u00e1ndor Ferenczi, Volume 2: 1914-1919|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1993|ISBN=9780674174191|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bREsyHmISRcC&pg=PA311&lpg=PA311&dq=%22doubtful+to+me+whether+it+is+a+sign+of+political+shrewdness%22&source=bl&ots=kJuwG0xztD&sig=1_EiIW1PtgD3W32d4B9UQMnlpCo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAGoVChMIyZiXkYfKyAIVTNYUCh1WXwm2#v=onepage&q=%22doubtful%20to%20me%20whether%20it%20is%20a%20sign%20of%20political%20shrewdness%22&f=false\"}}</ref>}}\n\nOn 20 March 1919 the French presented the [[Fernand Vix|Vix Note]][http://www.generals.dk/general/Vix/Fernand/France.html] ordering Hungarian troops further back into Hungary; it was widely assumed that the military lines would be the new frontiers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} K\u00e1rolyi and Prime Minister [[D\u00e9nes Berinkey]] were now in an untenable position.  Although they did not want to accept this French demand, they were in no position to reject it either.  On 21 March, Berinkey resigned.  K\u00e1rolyi then announced that only the Social Democrats could form a new government.  Unknown to K\u00e1rolyi, however, the Social Democrats had merged their party with the Communists led by [[B\u00e9la Kun]].  Hours after Berinkey resigned, the newly merged Hungarian Socialist Party announced K\u00e1rolyi's resignation and the formation of the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]].

K\u00e1rolyi, born of a cousin's marriage, thus born with a severe malformation: [[Cleft lip and cleft palate]], and his illness deeply determined his entire childhood and personality development. Her mother died early in Tuberculosis and her father soon remarried. Mih\u00e1ly was considered unsuitable for a more serious career by his father, because he was incapable of normal speech training. Mih\u00e1ly was raised with great devotion by his maternal grandmother.\n\nHe was raised with overcare with his older sister in the Castle of his grandmother at F\u00f3t, because Count Julius K\u00e1rolyi,  the politician father had not enough time for Mih\u00e1ly. At the age of 14, his grandmother sent him to a Viennese clinic and he underwent a special surgery to restore his palate and mouth. [7] The surgery proved to be a sharp turning point: After some weeks Mih\u00e1ly started to speak quickly, fluently and very elaborately, despite the family and relatives formerly thought that he is too dumb to speak. By this time, he was a relatively superficial aristocrat, but his knowledge and awareness was below that of his contemporaries. His thinking and character were shaped by extracurricular influences: the hatred towards the Habsburg dynasty, the traditional anti-German sentiment of his family, his foster father, the world-view of S\u00e1ndor K\u00e1rolyi in the 1848 revolution, his idea of organizing peasants into farming cooperatives. Based on his reading experiences, including the French Encyclop\u00e9die and Jules Verne novels, he developed an idealistic devotion to the cause of world justice, unbroken optimistic faith in the fast development of science and technology, which will solve all problems of humankind. He was not interested in university lectures, he managed to pass his exams with the help of a tutor. Nevertheless, he obtained his law degree and, at the age of 24, became a rampant adult. He wanted to make up for what he had missed as a teenager, throwing himself into the nightlife, with striking vehemence; he spent his time ruthlessly, playing cards, having fun in hunting, living in French spa towns, attended many international horse races and early automobile racings in various European countries. Known for his card battles, his lone card losses and his \"dandy\" lifestyle, the young tycoon begins to get serious and turn to politics and public life.\n\n<center>\n<gallery>\nFile:F\u00f3ti K\u00e1rolyi-kast\u00e9ly.jpg|thumb|One of his grandmother's castle complex of F\u00f3t, where Mih\u00e1ly grew up\nFile:Fehervarcsurgo kastelycivertanlegi4.jpg|thumb|Feh\u00e9rv\u00e1rcsurg\u00f3 Castle\nFile:Nagym\u00e1gocs - Palace.jpg|thumb|Nagym\u00e1gocs - Palace\nFile:CivertanlegifotoFuzerradvany2.jpg|thumb|F\u00fcz\u00e9rradv\u00e1ny Castle\nFile:K\u00e1rolyi-palota, Budapest.jpg|thumb|K\u00e1rolyi-palota, Budapest downtown\nFile:K\u00e1rolyi-kast\u00e9ly (Kast\u00e9lyhotel Sasv\u00e1r) (5819. sz\u00e1m\u00fa m\u0171eml\u00e9k).jpg|Par\u00e1dsasv\u00e1r Castle\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n====Early Political career ====\n\nIn his youth, he was a wastrel, but as he grew older, he became devoted to more serious pursuits.

Initially a supporter of the existing political and social system in Hungary, K\u00e1rolyi gradually became more progressive and [[left-wing]] during his career.\n\nIn 1910, K\u00e1rolyi was elected to Parliament as a member of the opposition Party of Independence.\n\nIn January 1913, he was challenged to a duel by prime minister [[Istv\u00e1n Tisza]], after refusing to shake Tisza's hand following a political disagreement.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=1913: The Defiant Swan Song|last=Cowles|first=Virginia|publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson|year=1967|isbn=|location=London|pages=157-158|url-status=live}}</ref> The 34-bout duel with cavalry sabres lasted an hour until Tisza cut K\u00e1rolyi's arm and the seconds ended the duel.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== World War I, political campaign for the Allied Powers===\nDuring the [[First World War]], the pro-Entente K\u00e1rolyi led a small but very active pacifist anti-war maverick fraction in the Hungarian parliament.<ref>{{cite book|author1=[[Robert Paxton]]|author2=Julie Hessler|title=Europe in the Twentieth Century|publisher=[[CEngage Learning]]|year=2011|page=129|ISBN=9780495913191|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M5wTncOaHEQC&pg=PA129&dq=%22mih%C3%A1ly+k%C3%A1rolyi%22+pacifist+party&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiN0YqCj_3YAhVJPRQKHb_YDCIQ6AEIRTAG#v=onepage&q=%22mih%C3%A1ly%20k%C3%A1rolyi%22&f=false}}</ref> K\u00e1rolyi made contact with British and French Entente diplomats behind the scenes in Switzerland during the war.<ref>{{cite book|author=Deborah S.

K\u00e1rolyi argued for peace with the Allies, looser ties between Austria and Hungary, abolishing the property-based franchise requirements that allowed only 5.8% of the population to vote and run for office before the war, and giving women the right to vote and hold office. In particular, K\u00e1rolyi's demand in 1915 that veterans should be granted the right to vote won so much popular support that enraged the Prime Minister, Count [[Istv\u00e1n Tisza]].  In 1916 K\u00e1rolyi broke off with his party, which had found his openly pro-Entente attitude to be too radical and dangerous for a war-time pacifist fraction in the parliament. Therefore K\u00e1rolyi formed a new party, called the United Party of Independence and of 1848, and generally known as the '''K\u00e1rolyi Party'''.\n\nIn January 1918, K\u00e1rolyi proclaimed himself a follower of [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s [[Fourteen Points]].\n\n==Marriage and family ==\nOn 7 November 1914 in [[Budapest]], K\u00e1rolyi married Countess Katalin Andr\u00e1ssy de Cs\u00edkszentkir\u00e1ly et Krasznahorka, with whom he had three children. K\u00e1rolyi's wife was a member of one of Hungary's most powerful families, and this marriage won K\u00e1rolyi the protection of his influential father-in-law.\n\n==Leading the Democratic Republic==\n\nFollowing the [[Aster Revolution]] of October 1918, K\u00e1rolyi became leader of the nation. On 25 October 1918 K\u00e1rolyi had formed an opposition National Council. His reputation as an opponent of the much-hated war had thrust him into a role for which he was not suited.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} King-Emperor [[Karl I of Austria|Charles IV]] designated him as Prime Minister as a part of a desperate attempt to hold Hungary on to the [[Habsburgs]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} K\u00e1rolyi would have preferred to keep the monarchy and some link to [[Austria]] if possible.

The Hungarian self-disarmament made the occupation of Hungary directly possible for the relatively small armies of Romania, the Franco-Serbian army and the armed forces of the newly established Czechoslovakia. During the rule of K\u00e1rolyi's pacifist cabinet, Hungary lost control over approx. 75% of its former pre-WW1 territories (325 411&nbsp;km\u00b2) without armed resistance and was subject to foreign occupation.\n\nMilitary and political events changed rapidly and drastically after the Hungarian disarmament. On 5 November 1918, the Serbian army, with the help of the French army, crossed southern borders. On 8 November, the Czechoslovak Army crossed the northern borders, and on 13 November, the Romanian army crossed the eastern borders of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. On 13 November, K\u00e1rolyi signed an [[armistice]] with the Allied nations in [[Belgrade]]. It limited the size of the Hungarian army to six infantry and two cavalry divisions.<ref>Krizman B.

K\u00e1rolyi ruled Hungary through a National Council, transformed into the government that consisted of his party in alliance with the large [[Hungarian Social Democratic Party]] and the small Civic Radical Party led by [[Oszk\u00e1r J\u00e1szi]].\n\nAt the same time, there existed various revolutionary councils, which were dominated by the Social Democrats, which were not unlike the ''[[Soviet Union|Soviet]]s'' (Councils) that existed in [[Russia]] in 1917.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}  This situation of [[Dual Power]] gave K\u00e1rolyi responsibility without much power while giving the Social Democrats power without much responsibility.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n[[File:Mihaly-karolyi-II--outlawsdiary00tormuoft.png|thumb|250px|left|Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi in a speech]]\nDuring their brief periods in power, K\u00e1rolyi and J\u00e1szi, who served as Nationalities Minister, tried to create an \"Eastern Switzerland\" by persuading the non-Magyar peoples of Hungary to stay as part of the new Hungarian Democratic Republic.\n\nAdditional trouble for the new government occurred over the question of the armistice. [[Austria-Hungary]] had signed the lenient [[Armistice of villa Giusti]] (close to [[Padua]], [[Italy]]) with the Allies on 3 November 1918. Since Hungary was now independent, some in the Cabinet argued that Hungary needed to sign a new armistice.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Against his better judgement, K\u00e1rolyi agreed to this idea,{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} and had Hungary sign in November 1918, a new armistice with the Allies in [[Belgrade]] with the Allied Commander in the Balkans, the French General [[Louis Franchet d'Esperey]].\n\nGeneral Franchet d'Esperey treated the Hungarians with open contempt and imposed a much harsher armistice on the defeated nation than the Padua Armistice had.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} This was the source of much criticism of K\u00e1rolyi, who had been expected \u2013 and who himself expected \u2013 the Allies to treat Hungary as a friend, not an enemy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Moreover, K\u00e1rolyi's opponents argued that by needlessly seeking a second armistice, K\u00e1rolyi had worsened Hungary's situation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nFurthermore, the Social Democrats who were Hungary's largest party by far, frequently undercut K\u00e1rolyi and imposed their decisions on him without taking responsibility for their actions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} K\u00e1rolyi wished to transfer almost all of the rural lands to the peasants.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} To set an example, he gave all of his own vast family estates to his tenants. But this was the only land transfer that took place; the Social Democrats blocked any measures that might give the control of those lands to the peasantry on the grounds that it was promoting capitalism. {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n[[File:Mihaly-karolyi-reparto-tierras--outlawsdiary00tormuoft.png|thumb|250px|right|Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi distributing his lands among the peasants.]]\nIn another equally unfortunate move, the pacific-minded K\u00e1rolyi had abolished almost all the Hungarian armed forces in November 1918.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} All through the winter of 1918\u201319, the [[Romanians]], the [[Yugoslavs]] and the Czechoslovaks often broke the armistice in order to seize more territory for themselves. After January 1919, K\u00e1rolyi ordered the build-up of a Hungarian army and started to consider the idea of an alliance with Soviet Russia, through K\u00e1rolyi was opposed to the idea of Communism in Hungary itself.\n\nIn addition, as Hungary had signed an armistice, not a peace treaty, the Allied blockade continued until such time as a peace treaty was signed. Hungary had suffered from food shortages throughout the war and deaths from starvation had become common from 1917 onwards. Furthermore,  the country had been overwhelmed with refugees from [[Transylvania]] and [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]].\n\nMaking things worse was the creation of [[Czechoslovakia]] which had cut Hungary off from supplies of German [[coal]]. Hungary which possessed little coal depended upon German coal imports. Without coal, most had to live without heat in the winter of 1918\u201319, and the railroad network had gradually ceased to function. The collapse of railroads in their turn caused the collapse of industry and hence mass [[unemployment]].\n\nMaking things even worse was the economic incompetence of the government which printed more and more money, leading to massive [[inflation]] and even more impoverishment. K\u00e1rolyi's failure to improve living conditions or persuade the Allies to lift the blockade led to public criticism of K\u00e1rolyi.\n\nBaron [[Lajos Hatvany]] described K\u00e1rolyi's leadership well when he noted \"From the discussions no decisions arose, and from the decisions \u2013 no actions.

Although they did not want to accept this French demand, they were in no position to reject it either.  On 21 March, Berinkey resigned.  K\u00e1rolyi then announced that only the Social Democrats could form a new government.  Unknown to K\u00e1rolyi, however, the Social Democrats had merged their party with the Communists led by [[B\u00e9la Kun]].  Hours after Berinkey resigned, the newly merged Hungarian Socialist Party announced K\u00e1rolyi's resignation and the formation of the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]].

K\u00e1rolyi applied for a visa to come to the United States to visit her, but the State Department imposed a gag order, preventing him from giving any political speeches, as the State Department believed him to be a [[Communist]].
