As a young man, he studied grammar, law, tradition, medicine, alchemy and philosophy. He focused his studies on ancient authors, in particular [[Aristotle]], after first adopting [[Avicenna]] [Ibn S\u012bn\u0101] as his philosophical mentor at the suggestion of a wandering scholar from the [[Maghreb]]. He traveled extensively and resided for a while in [[Mosul]] (in 1189) where he studied the works of al-Suhrawardi before traveling on to [[Damascus]] (1190) and the camp of [[Saladin]] outside [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] (1191). It was at the latter location that he met Baha\u2019 al-Din Ibn Shaddad and \u2018Imad al-Din al-Isfahani and acquired the [[Qadi]] al-Fadil's patronage. He went on to [[Cairo]], where he met Abu'l-Qasim al-Shari'i, who introduced him to the works of al-Farabi, [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]], and [[Themistius]] and (according to al-Latif) turned him away from Avicenna and alchemy.{{sfnm|Leaman|2015|1p=44|Meri|2005|2p=2}}\n\nHe met Saladin himself in 1192 in [[Jerusalem]] and enjoyed his patronage, then went to Damascus again before returning to Cairo. In later years he again journeyed to Jerusalem and to Damascus in 1207-8, and eventually made his way via [[Aleppo]] to [[Erzindjan]], where he remained at the court of the Mengujekid Ala\u2019-al-Din Da\u2019ud [D\u0101w\u016bd Sh\u0101h] until the city was conquered by the [[Sultanate of Rum|R\u016bm Seljuk]] ruler [[Kayqub\u0101d Ibn Kaykhusraw]] [Kayqub\u0101d II]. \u2018Abd al-Latif returned to Baghdad in 1229, travelling back via [[Erzerum]], [[Kamakh]], [[Divri\u011fi]] and [[Malatya]]. He died in Baghdad two years later.{{sfnm|Leaman|2015|1p=44|Meri|2005|2p=2}}\n\n==''Account of Egypt''==\n\u02bfAbd al-La\u1e6d\u012bf was undoubtedly a man of great knowledge and of an inquisitive and penetrating mind. Of the numerous works (mostly on medicine) which Ibn Ab\u012b U\u1e63aybi\u02bfah ascribes to him, one only, his graphic and detailed ''Account of Egypt'' (in two parts), appears to be known in [[Europe]].<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Abdallatif|volume=1|pages=30-31}}</ref>\n\n===Archeology===\n\u02bfAbd-al-La\u1e6d\u012bf was well aware of the value of ancient monuments. He praised Muslim rulers for preserving and protecting pre-Islamic artifacts and monuments, but he also criticized them for failing to do this. He noted that the preservation of antiquities presented a number of benefits for Muslims:{{sfn|El Daly|2004|page=10}}\n* \"monuments are useful historical evidence for chronologies\";\n* \"they furnish evidence for Holy Scriptures, since the Qur'an mentions them and their people\";\n* \"they are reminders of human endurance and fate\";\n* \"they show, to a degree, the politics and history of ancestors, the richness of their sciences, and the genius of their thought\".\n\nWhile discussing the profession of [[treasure hunting]], he notes that poorer treasure hunters were often sponsored by rich businessmen to go on [[Archeology|archeological]] expeditions. In some cases, an expedition could turn out to be [[fraud]], with the treasure hunter disappearing with large amounts of money extracted from sponsors. This fraudulent practice continues to the present day, with rich businessmen in Egypt still being deceived by local treasure hunters.{{sfn|El Daly|2004| page=36}}\n\n===Egyptology===\nThis work was one of the earliest works on [[Egyptology]]. It contains a vivid description of a [[famine]] caused, during the author's residence in Egypt, by the [[Nile]] failing to overflow its banks.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> He also wrote detailed descriptions on [[Ancient Egyptian architecture|ancient Egyptian monuments]].{{sfn|El Daly|2004}}\n\n===Autopsy===\nAl-Baghd\u0101d\u012b wrote that during the famine in Egypt in 597 AH (1200 AD), he had the opportunity to [[observe]] and [[examine]] a large number of [[skeleton]]s. This was one of the earliest examples of a postmortem [[autopsy]], through which he discovered that [[Galen]] was incorrect regarding the formation of the [[bone]]s of the lower [[jaw]] [mandible], coccyx, and [[sacrum]].{{sfn|Savage-Smith|1996 |p=951}}\n\n===Translation===\nThe Arabic manuscript was discovered in 1665 by [[Edward Pococke]] the [[oriental studies|orientalist]], and preserved in the [[Bodleian Library]] {under siglum 230}.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> He then published the Arabic manuscript in the 1680s. His son, Edward Pococke the Younger, translated the work into [[Latin]], though he was only able to publish less than half of his work. [[Thomas Hunt (professor)|Thomas Hunt]] attempted to publish Pococke's complete translation in 1746, though his attempt was unsuccessful.{{sfn|Toomer|1996|p=272-273}} Pococke's complete Latin translation was eventually published by [[Joseph White (professor)|Joseph White]] of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] in 1800. The work was then translated into [[French language|French]], with valuable notes, by [[Silvestre de Sacy]] in 1810.{{sfn|Toomer|1996|p=275}}\n\n==Philosophy==\n\nAs far as philosophy is concerned, one may adduce that \u02bfAbd al-La\u1e6d\u012bf al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b regarded philosophers as paragons of real virtue and therefore he refused to accept as a true philosopher one lacking not only true insight, but also a truly moral personality as true philosophy was in the service of religion, verifying both belief and action. Apart from this he regarded the philosophers\u2019 ambitions as vain (Endress, in Martini Bonadeo, Philosophical journey, xi). \u02bfAbd al-La\u1e6d\u012bf composed several philosophical works, among which is an important and original commentary on Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics (Kit\u0101b f\u012b \u02bfilm m\u0101 ba\u02bfd al-\u1e6dab\u012b\u02bfa). This is a critical work in the process of the Arabic assimilation of Greek thought, demonstrating its author\u2019s acquaintance with the most important Greek metaphysical doctrines, as set out in the writings of al-Kind\u012b (d. circa 185-252/801-66) and al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b (d. 339/950). The philosophical section of his Book of the Two Pieces of Advice [Kit\u0101b al-Na\u1e63\u012b\u1e25atayn] contains an interesting and challenging defence of philosophy and illustrates the vibrancy of philosophical debate in the Islamic colleges. It moreover emphasises the idea that Islamic philosophy did not decline after the twelfth century CE (Martini Bonadeo, Philosophical journey; Gutas). \u02bfAbd al-La\u1e6d\u012bf al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b may therefore well be an exponent of what Gutas calls the \u201cgolden age of Arabic philosophy\u201d (Gutas, 20).\n\n==Alchemy==\n\n\u02bfAbd al-La\u1e6d\u012bf also penned two passionate and somewhat grotesque pamphlets against the art of alchemy in all  its facets. Although he engaged himself with alchemy for a short while, he later abandoned the art completely by rejecting not only its practice, but also its theory. In \u02bfAbd al-La\u1e6d\u012bf\u2019s view alchemy could not be placed in the system of the sciences, and its false presumptions and pretensions must be distinguished from true scientific knowledge, which can be given a rational basis (Joosse, Rebellious intellectual, 29-62; Joosse, Unmasking the craft, 301-17; Martini Bonadeo, Philosophical journey, 5-6 and 203-5; Stern, 66-7; Allemann).\n\n==Medical works==\n\nUnfortunately, the majority of \u02bfAbd al-La\u1e6d\u012bf\u2019s medical oeuvre is lost today, but a number of interesting and important works by him remain (Joosse, Rebellious intellectual, 11-2; Joosse and Pormann, Decline, 6-8). One of the almost forgotten masterpieces of Arabic-Islamic medicine constitutes the Book of the Two Pieces of Advice. \u02bfAbd al-La\u1e6d\u012bf composed this book as a diatribe directed against false knowledge which, according to its author, is worse than ignorance. As the title suggests, it is divided into \u2018two pieces of advice\u2019, that is, advice for respectively \u2018would-be physicians\u2019 and \u2018would-be philosophers\u2019. Both parties incur \u02bfAbd al-La\u1e6d\u012bf\u2019s scathing criticism and find themselves lambasted in no uncertain terms. The work is generally intended to advise and recommend to physicians and philosophers to abandon the medicine and philosophy of Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 (d. 428/1037) and instead turn to the Greek originals, Hippocrates and Galen for medicine and Plato and Aristotle for philosophy. The medical section, rebuking the doctors of his day, contains four main themes: \n1) medical epistemology: the study of the nature, origin, and limits of human knowledge with regard to medicine; 2) medical deontology: the discussion of the methods and practices (the ethical code if any) of charlatans and quacks; 3) the idea that book-learning is not sufficient for practising medicine; and 4) the danger of prescribing and using purgatives without having the necessary skills and the full knowledge of the facts. \nThe author lamented the pitiful state of medicine. He employed the framework of Greek medical epistemology to criticize the rationalist physicians of his day and age, for he argued that female and itinerant practitioners, relying on experience, were not seldom superior to some rationalists. In \u02bfAbd al-La\u1e6d\u012bf\u2019s view the empiricist and the rationalist doctor often resorted to the same treatment: blood-letting until the patient faints. They differed, however, as to how they arrive at this treatment. \u02bfAbd al-La\u1e6d\u012bf\u2019s rather ironical account of how the rationalist doctor wastes time curing a patient by elaborately dividing and subdividing the latter\u2019s fever appears to contain some mildly critical overtones (Joosse and Pormann, Decline, 10-11). All this may point to the fact that \u02bfAbd al-La\u1e6d\u012bf adopted a somewhat flexible epistemological position. He recognized logic and reason as extremely important to the medical art, but also thought that experience when properly qualified, constituted an important weapon in the physician\u2019s arsenal. Thus he combined critical rationalism and sober empiricism. He decried the wickedness and incompetence of certain medical doctors of his time, which he described as \u2018spongers\u2019 (mustarziqa), and did not tire to extol the virtues of the ancient doctors such as Hippocrates, Dioscorides and of course his great role model Galen of Pergamon. In addition, he ran contemporaneous medical education into the ground because it was too scholastic and put too much faith in a restricted number of textbooks, such as the Generalities (Kulliyy\u0101t) in the Canon of Medicine (al-Q\u0101n\u016bn f\u012b l-\u1e6dibb) by the celebrated physician Ibn S\u012bn\u0101, or merely relied on imperfect and badly written abridgments (Joosse, Rebellious Intellectual, 10; Joosse and Pormann, Decline, 21-3; Martini Bonadeo, Philosophical journey, 144-57 [medical section] and 157-73 [philosophical section]). \nIn conclusion, one can maintain that in the area of medicine, \u02bfAbd al-La\u1e6d\u012bf appears as a highly original thinker who had new and startling things to say. He had some highly original ideas about epistemology, probability, medical education and the position of women in medicine, and moreover criticized the almost unassailable Galen for his anatomical views. His observations and views also have strong implications for the social history of medicine during his day and age, although a detailed and diachronic picture of how medicine and society interacted during the later Islamic Middle Ages, the so-called post-classical period, still lies in the distant future. \nAnother important element in \u02bfAbd al-La\u1e6d\u012bf al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b\u2019s medical oeuvre are the Hippocratic commentaries. He notably claimed that the two most important texts for clinical medicine were the Aphorisms (Fu\u1e63\u016bl) and the Prognostic (Taqdimat al-ma\u02bfrifa), and he wrote extensive commentaries on both these works (Joosse and Pormann, Aphorisms; Idem, Prognostic). He also composed a highly informative treatise on diabetes, which presents us with a wonderful insight of the disease and its therapy in his day and age  (Thies, 1971; Degen, 1977; Ullmann, review, 1972; cf. also Joosse, art. \"\u02bfAbd al-La\u1e6d\u012bf al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b\" in: Encyclopaedia of Islam ''Three'').\n\n==Spiritualism==\n\nDuring the years following the Great War [i.e. the First World War, 1914-18] \u02bfAbd al-La\u1e6d\u012bf al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b\u2019s name miraculously reappeared within the spiritualistic movement in the United Kingdom. He was introduced to the public by the Irish medium Eileen J. Garrett, the author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and the spiritualist R.H. Saunders and became known as Abduhl Latif, the great Persian physician. He is said to have acted as a control of mediums until the mid 1960\u2019s (Joosse, Geest, 221-9). The Bodleian Library MS Pococke 230 and the interpretation of the Videans (Zand-Videan, 8-9) may also have prompted the whimsical short-story \u2018Ghost Writer\u2019, as told to Tim Mackintosh-Smith, in which \u02bfAbd al-La\u1e6d\u012bf al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b speaks in the first person.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Allemann, Franz, \u02bfAbdalla\u1e6d\u012bf al-Ba\u0121d\u0101d\u012b: Ris\u0101lah f\u012b Mudj\u0101dalat al-\u1e25ak\u012bmain al-k\u012bmiy\u0101\u02be\u012b wan-na\u1e93ar\u012b (\u201cDas Streitgespr\u00e4ch zwischen dem Alchemisten und dem theoretischen Philosophen\u201d).

As a young man, he studied grammar, law, tradition, medicine, alchemy and philosophy. He focused his studies on ancient authors, in particular [[Aristotle]], after first adopting [[Avicenna]] [Ibn S\u012bn\u0101] as his philosophical mentor at the suggestion of a wandering scholar from the [[Maghreb]]. He traveled extensively and resided for a while in [[Mosul]] (in 1189) where he studied the works of al-Suhrawardi before traveling on to [[Damascus]] (1190) and the camp of [[Saladin]] outside [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] (1191). It was at the latter location that he met Baha\u2019 al-Din Ibn Shaddad and \u2018Imad al-Din al-Isfahani and acquired the [[Qadi]] al-Fadil's patronage. He went on to [[Cairo]], where he met Abu'l-Qasim al-Shari'i, who introduced him to the works of al-Farabi, [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]], and [[Themistius]] and (according to al-Latif) turned him away from Avicenna and alchemy.{{sfnm|Leaman|2015|1p=44|Meri|2005|2p=2}}\n\nHe met Saladin himself in 1192 in [[Jerusalem]] and enjoyed his patronage, then went to Damascus again before returning to Cairo. In later years he again journeyed to Jerusalem and to Damascus in 1207-8, and eventually made his way via [[Aleppo]] to [[Erzindjan]], where he remained at the court of the Mengujekid Ala\u2019-al-Din Da\u2019ud [D\u0101w\u016bd Sh\u0101h] until the city was conquered by the [[Sultanate of Rum|R\u016bm Seljuk]] ruler [[Kayqub\u0101d Ibn Kaykhusraw]] [Kayqub\u0101d II]. \u2018Abd al-Latif returned to Baghdad in 1229, travelling back via [[Erzerum]], [[Kamakh]], [[Divri\u011fi]] and [[Malatya]]. He died in Baghdad two years later.{{sfnm|Leaman|2015|1p=44|Meri|2005|2p=2}}\n\n==''Account of Egypt''==\n\u02bfAbd al-La\u1e6d\u012bf was undoubtedly a man of great knowledge and of an inquisitive and penetrating mind. Of the numerous works (mostly on medicine) which Ibn Ab\u012b U\u1e63aybi\u02bfah ascribes to him, one only, his graphic and detailed ''Account of Egypt'' (in two parts), appears to be known in [[Europe]].<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Abdallatif|volume=1|pages=30-31}}</ref>\n\n===Archeology===\n\u02bfAbd-al-La\u1e6d\u012bf was well aware of the value of ancient monuments. He praised Muslim rulers for preserving and protecting pre-Islamic artifacts and monuments, but he also criticized them for failing to do this. He noted that the preservation of antiquities presented a number of benefits for Muslims:{{sfn|El Daly|2004|page=10}}\n* \"monuments are useful historical evidence for chronologies\";\n* \"they furnish evidence for Holy Scriptures, since the Qur'an mentions them and their people\";\n* \"they are reminders of human endurance and fate\";\n* \"they show, to a degree, the politics and history of ancestors, the richness of their sciences, and the genius of their thought\".\n\nWhile discussing the profession of [[treasure hunting]], he notes that poorer treasure hunters were often sponsored by rich businessmen to go on [[Archeology|archeological]] expeditions. In some cases, an expedition could turn out to be [[fraud]], with the treasure hunter disappearing with large amounts of money extracted from sponsors. This fraudulent practice continues to the present day, with rich businessmen in Egypt still being deceived by local treasure hunters.{{sfn|El Daly|2004| page=36}}\n\n===Egyptology===\nThis work was one of the earliest works on [[Egyptology]]. It contains a vivid description of a [[famine]] caused, during the author's residence in Egypt, by the [[Nile]] failing to overflow its banks.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> He also wrote detailed descriptions on [[Ancient Egyptian architecture|ancient Egyptian monuments]].{{sfn|El Daly|2004}}\n\n===Autopsy===\nAl-Baghd\u0101d\u012b wrote that during the famine in Egypt in 597 AH (1200 AD), he had the opportunity to [[observe]] and [[examine]] a large number of [[skeleton]]s. This was one of the earliest examples of a postmortem [[autopsy]], through which he discovered that [[Galen]] was incorrect regarding the formation of the [[bone]]s of the lower [[jaw]] [mandible], coccyx, and [[sacrum]].{{sfn|Savage-Smith|1996 |p=951}}\n\n===Translation===\nThe Arabic manuscript was discovered in 1665 by [[Edward Pococke]] the [[oriental studies|orientalist]], and preserved in the [[Bodleian Library]] {under siglum 230}.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> He then published the Arabic manuscript in the 1680s. His son, Edward Pococke the Younger, translated the work into [[Latin]], though he was only able to publish less than half of his work. [[Thomas Hunt (professor)|Thomas Hunt]] attempted to publish Pococke's complete translation in 1746, though his attempt was unsuccessful.{{sfn|Toomer|1996|p=272-273}} Pococke's complete Latin translation was eventually published by [[Joseph White (professor)|Joseph White]] of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] in 1800. The work was then translated into [[French language|French]], with valuable notes, by [[Silvestre de Sacy]] in 1810.{{sfn|Toomer|1996|p=275}}\n\n==Philosophy==\n\nAs far as philosophy is concerned, one may adduce that \u02bfAbd al-La\u1e6d\u012bf al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b regarded philosophers as paragons of real virtue and therefore he refused to accept as a true philosopher one lacking not only true insight, but also a truly moral personality as true philosophy was in the service of religion, verifying both belief and action. Apart from this he regarded the philosophers\u2019 ambitions as vain (Endress, in Martini Bonadeo, Philosophical journey, xi). \u02bfAbd al-La\u1e6d\u012bf composed several philosophical works, among which is an important and original commentary on Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics (Kit\u0101b f\u012b \u02bfilm m\u0101 ba\u02bfd al-\u1e6dab\u012b\u02bfa). This is a critical work in the process of the Arabic assimilation of Greek thought, demonstrating its author\u2019s acquaintance with the most important Greek metaphysical doctrines, as set out in the writings of al-Kind\u012b (d. circa 185-252/801-66) and al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b (d. 339/950). The philosophical section of his Book of the Two Pieces of Advice [Kit\u0101b al-Na\u1e63\u012b\u1e25atayn] contains an interesting and challenging defence of philosophy and illustrates the vibrancy of philosophical debate in the Islamic colleges. It moreover emphasises the idea that Islamic philosophy did not decline after the twelfth century CE (Martini Bonadeo, Philosophical journey; Gutas). \u02bfAbd al-La\u1e6d\u012bf al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b may therefore well be an exponent of what Gutas calls the \u201cgolden age of Arabic philosophy\u201d (Gutas, 20).\n\n==Alchemy==\n\n\u02bfAbd al-La\u1e6d\u012bf also penned two passionate and somewhat grotesque pamphlets against the art of alchemy in all  its facets. Although he engaged himself with alchemy for a short while, he later abandoned the art completely by rejecting not only its practice, but also its theory. In \u02bfAbd al-La\u1e6d\u012bf\u2019s view alchemy could not be placed in the system of the sciences, and its false presumptions and pretensions must be distinguished from true scientific knowledge, which can be given a rational basis (Joosse, Rebellious intellectual, 29-62; Joosse, Unmasking the craft, 301-17; Martini Bonadeo, Philosophical journey, 5-6 and 203-5; Stern, 66-7; Allemann).\n\n==Medical works==\n\nUnfortunately, the majority of \u02bfAbd al-La\u1e6d\u012bf\u2019s medical oeuvre is lost today, but a number of interesting and important works by him remain (Joosse, Rebellious intellectual, 11-2; Joosse and Pormann, Decline, 6-8). One of the almost forgotten masterpieces of Arabic-Islamic medicine constitutes the Book of the Two Pieces of Advice. \u02bfAbd al-La\u1e6d\u012bf composed this book as a diatribe directed against false knowledge which, according to its author, is worse than ignorance. As the title suggests, it is divided into \u2018two pieces of advice\u2019, that is, advice for respectively \u2018would-be physicians\u2019 and \u2018would-be philosophers\u2019. Both parties incur \u02bfAbd al-La\u1e6d\u012bf\u2019s scathing criticism and find themselves lambasted in no uncertain terms. The work is generally intended to advise and recommend to physicians and philosophers to abandon the medicine and philosophy of Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 (d. 428/1037) and instead turn to the Greek originals, Hippocrates and Galen for medicine and Plato and Aristotle for philosophy. The medical section, rebuking the doctors of his day, contains four main themes: \n1) medical epistemology: the study of the nature, origin, and limits of human knowledge with regard to medicine; 2) medical deontology: the discussion of the methods and practices (the ethical code if any) of charlatans and quacks; 3) the idea that book-learning is not sufficient for practising medicine; and 4) the danger of prescribing and using purgatives without having the necessary skills and the full knowledge of the facts. \nThe author lamented the pitiful state of medicine. He employed the framework of Greek medical epistemology to criticize the rationalist physicians of his day and age, for he argued that female and itinerant practitioners, relying on experience, were not seldom superior to some rationalists. In \u02bfAbd al-La\u1e6d\u012bf\u2019s view the empiricist and the rationalist doctor often resorted to the same treatment: blood-letting until the patient faints. They differed, however, as to how they arrive at this treatment. \u02bfAbd al-La\u1e6d\u012bf\u2019s rather ironical account of how the rationalist doctor wastes time curing a patient by elaborately dividing and subdividing the latter\u2019s fever appears to contain some mildly critical overtones (Joosse and Pormann, Decline, 10-11). All this may point to the fact that \u02bfAbd al-La\u1e6d\u012bf adopted a somewhat flexible epistemological position. He recognized logic and reason as extremely important to the medical art, but also thought that experience when properly qualified, constituted an important weapon in the physician\u2019s arsenal. Thus he combined critical rationalism and sober empiricism. He decried the wickedness and incompetence of certain medical doctors of his time, which he described as \u2018spongers\u2019 (mustarziqa), and did not tire to extol the virtues of the ancient doctors such as Hippocrates, Dioscorides and of course his great role model Galen of Pergamon. In addition, he ran contemporaneous medical education into the ground because it was too scholastic and put too much faith in a restricted number of textbooks, such as the Generalities (Kulliyy\u0101t) in the Canon of Medicine (al-Q\u0101n\u016bn f\u012b l-\u1e6dibb) by the celebrated physician Ibn S\u012bn\u0101, or merely relied on imperfect and badly written abridgments (Joosse, Rebellious Intellectual, 10; Joosse and Pormann, Decline, 21-3; Martini Bonadeo, Philosophical journey, 144-57 [medical section] and 157-73 [philosophical section]). \nIn conclusion, one can maintain that in the area of medicine, \u02bfAbd al-La\u1e6d\u012bf appears as a highly original thinker who had new and startling things to say. He had some highly original ideas about epistemology, probability, medical education and the position of women in medicine, and moreover criticized the almost unassailable Galen for his anatomical views. His observations and views also have strong implications for the social history of medicine during his day and age, although a detailed and diachronic picture of how medicine and society interacted during the later Islamic Middle Ages, the so-called post-classical period, still lies in the distant future. \nAnother important element in \u02bfAbd al-La\u1e6d\u012bf al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b\u2019s medical oeuvre are the Hippocratic commentaries. He notably claimed that the two most important texts for clinical medicine were the Aphorisms (Fu\u1e63\u016bl) and the Prognostic (Taqdimat al-ma\u02bfrifa), and he wrote extensive commentaries on both these works (Joosse and Pormann, Aphorisms; Idem, Prognostic). He also composed a highly informative treatise on diabetes, which presents us with a wonderful insight of the disease and its therapy in his day and age  (Thies, 1971; Degen, 1977; Ullmann, review, 1972; cf. also Joosse, art. \"\u02bfAbd al-La\u1e6d\u012bf al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b\" in: Encyclopaedia of Islam ''Three'').\n\n==Spiritualism==\n\nDuring the years following the Great War [i.e. the First World War, 1914-18] \u02bfAbd al-La\u1e6d\u012bf al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b\u2019s name miraculously reappeared within the spiritualistic movement in the United Kingdom.

Shortnose sturgeon were considered extinct in the Satilla, St. Marys, and the St. Johns rivers, but were recently found again in both the Satilla and St. Marys rivers.\n \nIn the northern and mid-Atlantic metapopulations, shortnose sturgeon are currently found in Saint John (Canada), Penobscot, Kennebec, Androscoggin, Piscataqua, Merrimack, Connecticut, Hudson, Delaware, and Potomac rivers. They have also been spotted foraging and transiting in the St. George, Medomak, Damariscotta, Sheepscot, Saco, Deerfield, East, and Susquehanna rivers.

Because shortnose sturgeon are [[amphidromous]] fish, after spawning most of their time is spent in estuaries and rivers. Shortnose sturgeon rarely spend time in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. However, if the sturgeon do enter marine waters to feed or migrate they stay close to the shore. Shortnose sturgeon are more likely to move through all areas of a river system. Times they remain at sites for an extended period of time include resting and feeding periods.<ref | name=Occurrence_and_distribution_of_shortnose sturgeon_Acipenser_brevirostrum_,_in_the_upper_tidal_Delaware_River> Estuaries.

This is an area of the conservation plan that is essential to the conservation of the species. Research needs to be done to identify what habitats are critical to ensure the protection of each life stage.\n \nOne area of research for discovering and designating critical habitat of shortnose sturgeon will be the study of foraging ecology and growth of the various life stages, as well as defining the [[benthic]] habitats that support preferred prey. To enhance this understanding, results on the mapping of the benthic organisms will be needed to better define both the available and preferred diets of sturgeon. Probabilistic or generalized linear models or similar approaches used to map benthic habitat should be constructed to help identify the distribution of shortnose sturgeon density. Additionally, obtaining information on nursery areas and characterization of nursery habitat is a major priority.\n\n==Description==\nThe shortnose sturgeon is the smallest of three sturgeon species that are present in the eastern seaboard of North America. It has a cylindrical body and compared to the Atlantic sturgeon, its head and snout are relatively small. Younger shortnose sturgeons tend to have longer snouts compared to their older counterparts. Adult sturgeons have bony plates along their [[esophagus]] that help them crush hard items instead of having teeth.\n \nShortnose sturgeon are cartilaginous with bones only in the skull, jaw and pectoral girdle. It is a [[physostome]] fish, so its swim bladder is connected to the intestinal tract by a special duct. This duct allows for gas pressure regulation through swallowing air or releasing air through the gut. The intestines for shortnose sturgeon are dark and have a spiral valve (important for nutrient absorption), similar to that of sharks and rays. As seen in the image, these sturgeons tend to be generally dark brown to olive/black on the dorsal surface.\n[[File:John White Paints New World.jpg|left|thumb|Fishing for sturgeon was a common practice among Native Americans and settlers who arrived along the East Coast of North American. ]]\nShortnose sturgeon tend to consume small [[bivalves]], [[gastropods]], [[polychaetes]], and small benthic fishes based on studies of their gut contents. The most common prey are amphipods, while Atlantic sturgeon primarily consume polychaetes. Some reports have found that female adult shortnose sturgeon feed throughout the year, but a study from the Saint John River found that pre-spawning females rarely had food in their stomachs and likely stopped feeding about eight months prior to spawning while ripening males generally had full stomachs.\n \nSturgeon are often called \"living fossils\", due to their ancient lineage and a fossil record that points to a holarctic distribution. With the earliest reported remains of North American sturgeon dating to the late [[Cretaceous period]]. Sturgeons have bony plates called scutes that extend from the skull to the caudal peduncle and are divided into five rows on the body: one dorsal row, then two lateral and ventral rows respectively. The fins on the shortnose sturgeon are located far back on the body. The pectoral fins are positioned low, while the pelvic fins are along with the abdominal position. Prominent features of the shortnose sturgeon are the scutes, protractile tube-like mouth, and chemosensory barbels. Sturgeon tend to be long-lived, slow-maturing, and spawn infrequently, which have served the species well through evolutionary time but poorly to anthropogenic impacts like overharvesting, habitat loss, and degradation. \n \nPotential predators of the shortnose sturgeon include alligators, sharks, and other large fish such as [[catfish]]. Other known ones include [[sea lampreys]] gar, [[striped bass]], [[common carp]], [[northern pikeminnow]], [[channel catfish]], smallmouth bass, [[yellow perch]], walleye, grey seal, [[fallfish]], and [[sea lions]].<ref | name=2020_biological_assessment_of_shortnose_sturgeon_d>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. (2010). [https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/17811 Five Year Plan for the Shortnose Sturgeon (''Acipenser brevirostrum'')].\u2029</ref>\n\n==Behavior==\nThe life history of shortnose sturgeon beings with adults that lay their eggs in freshwater and then return to saltwater. The eggs are left to fend for themselves after spawning. As they age, the young fish slowly move to more saline water. Living in fresh or brackish water until they are at least a year old. Males can live up to around 30 years old while females can live to be close to 70 years old.\n \nShortnose sturgeon spawn in moving freshwater water, over rubble or gravel bottoms. Time of spawning varies by latitude and is likely based on water temperatures in the range from 6.5\u201315 \u00b0C; this may be as early as January in South Carolina or as late as May in Canada. The eggs hatch after 13 days, into 7\u2013 to 11-mm-long hatchlings with a large yolk sac, minimal sight, minimal swimming ability, and a strong tendency to seek cover. After another 9\u201312 days, they mature to a swimming larval stage at about 15 mm in length, resembling a miniature adult by the time they reach 20 mm in length and begin feeding. They then drift downstream in the deep channels of the river, remaining in freshwater for the first year of their lives. Juveniles, up to 18 in long, generally move to brackish water, and move with it through the tidal cycle.\n \nAdults mature sexually around 18 to 22 inches in length. Males mature after 2\u20133 years in their warmest habitats or 10\u201314 years in colder climates, and females mature between 6 and 17 years of age (again, earlier in southern rivers). Adults continue to grow to between 3 and 4 ft in length. A male may breed every year or every other year and seldom lives beyond age 30. Females usually breed every third to the fifth year, lying between 40,000 and 200,000 eggs when they breed and can live to age 67. Females spend multiple years with reduced feeding and growth while they are producing the gonadal material needed for spawning.\n \nBehavioral information has been collected and demonstrated differences in the innate dispersal patterns in early life stages of shortnose sturgeon from the [[Connecticut River]] versus those of [[Savannah River]] origin. This research suggested that shortnose sturgeon are likely behaviorally adapted to unique features of their watershed.\n\n==Major Threats to Species and Human Impact==\n\nAlthough there are now about 12,000 adult shortnose sturgeon living within the Delaware River estuary, the population faces serious human-induced threats.<ref | name=Shortnose_Sturgeon_The_Delaware_River> Conserve Wildlife Foundation of New Jersey. (2020) [http://www.conservewildlifenj.org/species/spotlight/sturgeon/] |author=Bowers-Altman, Jeanette </ref> Water quality contaminants such as endocrine distributing chemicals (EDCs) have been linked to reproductive and developmental disorders in many fish species. These contaminants were found in shortnose sturgeon tissue collected in 2001 and include PCDDs/TCDFs, DDE, PCBs, and cadmium. Other threats to Delaware River shortnose sturgeon include heavy industrialization and waterfront development. This destruction of habitat can affect the Sturgeon\u2019s ability to travel to freshwater and spawn or can degrade the quality of the habitat.<ref | name=sturgeon_c>The Red List of Threatened Species. (2004) [https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/222/13036088] |title=Shortnose Sturgeon |author= Friedland, K.D. |author= Kynard, B. |accessdate=2020-04-15 |year=2004 </ref> For example, some dams impede sturgeon travel back and forth between salt and fresh water, resulting in the disruption of natural spawning cycles and preventing the reproduction of the already struggling species.\n[[File:Veazie Dam Removal (9350435943).jpg|thumb|The Veazie Dam, the lowermost dam on the Penobscot River, has blocked Atlantic salmon, American shad, shortnose sturgeon, and eight other sea-run fish from reaching their spawning and juvenile growing habitat for nearly two centuries. Veazie will be the second dam removed in this monumental endeavor to recover these species.]]\nMore human-induced threats include ship/boat strikes, [[poaching]], mortality from commercial and recreational fishing (bycatch) due to high sensitivity to being caught, injury to early life stages from water intake systems, instream construction projects within the spawning area, and dredging, including the ongoing Delaware River deepening project.<ref | name=Sensitivity_of_North_American_sturgeons_and_paddlefish_to_fishing_mortality> Sturgeon Biodiversity and Conservation. (1996) [https://doi.org/10.1007/0-306-46854-9_28] |author= Boreman J. </ref> Additional research has been done to prove that [[algal blooms]], which can be caused by increased nitrogen levels in runoff or other anthropogenic factors, sometimes result in Shortnose Sturgeon die-offs.<ref | name=Saxitoxin_exposure> Marine Ecology Progress Series. (2012) [https://doi.org/10.3354/meps09768] |author=Fire, Spencer E. </ref>Overall, the combination of human-induced destruction of habitat and overconsumption have devastated many species along the Atlantic Coast. The future effects of climate change are not fully understood, however, these could potentially exacerbate many of these struggling populations even further.\n\n==Current Conservation Efforts==\nConservation efforts for the shortnose sturgeon include removing outdated dams from their habitats. The most recent recovery plan was enacted in December 1998,  for the National Marine Fisheries Service National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The stated goal of this plan is to recover populations to levels of abundance at which they no longer require protection under the ESA. For each population segment, the minimum population size will be large enough to maintain genetic diversity and avoid extinction.<ref | name=2020_biological_assessment_of_shortnose_sturgeon_e>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. (2010). [https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/17811 Five Year Plan for the Shortnose Sturgeon (''Acipenser brevirostrum'')].\u2029</ref>NOAA Fisheries work with conservation organizations, energy companies, states, tribes, and citizens to evaluate barriers\u2014big and small\u2014to improve upon fish passage.\n \nBreeding programs are currently being used to help the dwindling sturgeon populations. The fish are captured and bred to help provide important insight into the physical, chemical, and biological parameters necessary for the optimal growth, survival, and reproduction of shortnose sturgeon in the wild. Captive-bred animals are also used in permanent educational displays that promote public awareness of the plight of the species.\n \nEfforts are also being made to educate the public on the shortnose sturgeon. Scientists are working with students and teachers to learn more about the movements, behavior, and threats to sturgeons. An example of this initiative is the SCUTES program\u2014Students Collaborating to Undertake Tracking Efforts for Sturgeon. It provides lesson plans, educational kits, and an opportunity for classrooms to adopt a tagged sturgeon.\n\n==Original Recovery Plan==\nAfter listing the Shortnose Sturgeon as an endangered species in 1967, the 1998 Recovery Plan was enacted. The goal was to delist shortnose sturgeon populations throughout their range. The plan listed actions that if followed could restore the populations by the year 2024. Each of the population segments could become a candidate for downlisting when it reached a minimum population size that: 1) is large enough to prevent extinction, and 2) will make the loss of genetic diversity unlikely.  This minimum population size for each population segment had not yet been determined.<ref | name=Final_recovery_plan> National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration. (1998) [https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/15971] </ref>\nTo achieve and preserve minimum population sizes for each population segment, essential habitats were identified and maintained, and mortality, monitored and minimized. This plan has since been outdated and replaced. \n\n==5-Year Reviews==\nA Shortnose Sturgeon Status Review Team collected data and presented a \u201cA Biological Assessment of Shortnose Sturgeon\u201d to the National Marine Fisheries Service in 2010. In their assessment, the team identified aspects of Shortnose sturgeon ecology which requires continued research. Continuing research is needed in areas such as determining population size and structure, modelling larval distribution to identify effects of river manipulation by humans, and enhancing the effectiveness of mass rearing.\n \nThe team suggested the following research projects to be conducted in order to improve understanding of the shortnose sturgeons\u2019 status. Firstly, continue the survey and tracking of adults to gather additional tissue samples and detect changes in population status (abundance, residency ranges, winter ecology, and spawning success). Secondly, determine status of juveniles (an indication of recruitment) and characterize ecology and habitat use. \n \nThis review concluded that the shortnose sturgeon still requires conservation efforts to support populations. The species is still at high risk under the IUCN and ESA listings.<ref | name=2020_biological_assessment_of_shortnose_sturgeon_f>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. (2010).

Shortnose sturgeon were considered extinct in the Satilla, St. Marys, and the St. Johns rivers, but were recently found again in both the Satilla and St. Marys rivers.\n \nIn the northern and mid-Atlantic metapopulations, shortnose sturgeon are currently found in Saint John (Canada), Penobscot, Kennebec, Androscoggin, Piscataqua, Merrimack, Connecticut, Hudson, Delaware, and Potomac rivers. They have also been spotted foraging and transiting in the St. George, Medomak, Damariscotta, Sheepscot, Saco, Deerfield, East, and Susquehanna rivers. On rare occasions, they have been seen in the Narraguagus, Presumpscot, Westfield, Housatonic, Schuylkill, Rappahannock, and James rivers.<ref | name=2020_biological_assessment_of_shortnose_sturgeon_c>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  (2010). [https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/17811 Five Year Plan for the Shortnose Sturgeon (''Acipenser brevirostrum'')].</ref>\n\n==Habitat==\nShortnose sturgeon live in rivers and coastal waters that run from Canada to Florida. Because shortnose sturgeon are [[amphidromous]] fish, after spawning most of their time is spent in estuaries and rivers. Shortnose sturgeon rarely spend time in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. However, if the sturgeon do enter marine waters to feed or migrate they stay close to the shore. Shortnose sturgeon are more likely to move through all areas of a river system. Times they remain at sites for an extended period of time include resting and feeding periods.<ref | name=Occurrence_and_distribution_of_shortnose sturgeon_Acipenser_brevirostrum_,_in_the_upper_tidal_Delaware_River> Estuaries. (1987) [https://doi.org/10.2307/1351892] |title=Shortnose Sturgeon |author=Hastings, R.W. |author=O\u2019Herron, J.C. |author=Schick, K. </ref>\n\n[[Critical habitat]] has not been designated for the shortnose sturgeon. This is an area of the conservation plan that is essential to the conservation of the species. Research needs to be done to identify what habitats are critical to ensure the protection of each life stage.\n \nOne area of research for discovering and designating critical habitat of shortnose sturgeon will be the study of foraging ecology and growth of the various life stages, as well as defining the [[benthic]] habitats that support preferred prey. To enhance this understanding, results on the mapping of the benthic organisms will be needed to better define both the available and preferred diets of sturgeon. Probabilistic or generalized linear models or similar approaches used to map benthic habitat should be constructed to help identify the distribution of shortnose sturgeon density. Additionally, obtaining information on nursery areas and characterization of nursery habitat is a major priority.\n\n==Description==\nThe shortnose sturgeon is the smallest of three sturgeon species that are present in the eastern seaboard of North America. It has a cylindrical body and compared to the Atlantic sturgeon, its head and snout are relatively small. Younger shortnose sturgeons tend to have longer snouts compared to their older counterparts. Adult sturgeons have bony plates along their [[esophagus]] that help them crush hard items instead of having teeth.\n \nShortnose sturgeon are cartilaginous with bones only in the skull, jaw and pectoral girdle. It is a [[physostome]] fish, so its swim bladder is connected to the intestinal tract by a special duct. This duct allows for gas pressure regulation through swallowing air or releasing air through the gut. The intestines for shortnose sturgeon are dark and have a spiral valve (important for nutrient absorption), similar to that of sharks and rays. As seen in the image, these sturgeons tend to be generally dark brown to olive/black on the dorsal surface.\n \nShortnose sturgeon tend to consume small [[bivalves]], [[gastropods]], [[polychaetes]], and small benthic fishes based on studies of their gut contents. The most common prey are amphipods, while Atlantic sturgeon primarily consume polychaetes. Some reports have found that female adult shortnose sturgeon feed throughout the year, but a study from the Saint John River found that pre-spawning females rarely had food in their stomachs and likely stopped feeding about eight months prior to spawning while ripening males generally had full stomachs.\n \nSturgeon are often called \"living fossils\", due to their ancient lineage and a fossil record that points to a holarctic distribution. With the earliest reported remains of North American sturgeon dating to the late [[Cretaceous period]]. Sturgeons have bony plates called scutes that extend from the skull to the caudal peduncle and are divided into five rows on the body: one dorsal row, then two lateral and ventral rows respectively. The fins on the shortnose sturgeon are located far back on the body. The pectoral fins are positioned low, while the pelvic fins are along with the abdominal position. Prominent features of the shortnose sturgeon are the scutes, protractile tube-like mouth, and chemosensory barbels. Sturgeon tend to be long-lived, slow-maturing, and spawn infrequently, which have served the species well through evolutionary time but poorly to anthropogenic impacts like overharvesting, habitat loss, and degradation. \n \nPotential predators of the shortnose sturgeon include alligators, sharks, and other large fish such as [[catfish]]. Other known ones include [[sea lampreys]] gar, [[striped bass]], [[common carp]], [[northern pikeminnow]], [[channel catfish]], smallmouth bass, [[yellow perch]], walleye, grey seal, [[fallfish]], and [[sea lions]].<ref | name=2020_biological_assessment_of_shortnose_sturgeon_d>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. (2010). [https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/17811 Five Year Plan for the Shortnose Sturgeon (''Acipenser brevirostrum'')].\u2029</ref>\n\n==Behavior==\nThe life history of shortnose sturgeon beings with adults that lay their eggs in freshwater and then return to saltwater. The eggs are left to fend for themselves after spawning. As they age, the young fish slowly move to more saline water. Living in fresh or brackish water until they are at least a year old. Males can live up to around 30 years old while females can live to be close to 70 years old.\n \nShortnose sturgeon spawn in moving freshwater water, over rubble or gravel bottoms. Time of spawning varies by latitude and is likely based on water temperatures in the range from 6.5\u201315 \u00b0C; this may be as early as January in South Carolina or as late as May in Canada. The eggs hatch after 13 days, into 7\u2013 to 11-mm-long hatchlings with a large yolk sac, minimal sight, minimal swimming ability, and a strong tendency to seek cover. After another 9\u201312 days, they mature to a swimming larval stage at about 15 mm in length, resembling a miniature adult by the time they reach 20 mm in length and begin feeding. They then drift downstream in the deep channels of the river, remaining in freshwater for the first year of their lives. Juveniles, up to 18 in long, generally move to brackish water, and move with it through the tidal cycle.\n \nAdults mature sexually around 18 to 22 inches in length. Males mature after 2\u20133 years in their warmest habitats or 10\u201314 years in colder climates, and females mature between 6 and 17 years of age (again, earlier in southern rivers). Adults continue to grow to between 3 and 4 ft in length. A male may breed every year or every other year and seldom lives beyond age 30. Females usually breed every third to the fifth year, lying between 40,000 and 200,000 eggs when they breed and can live to age 67. Females spend multiple years with reduced feeding and growth while they are producing the gonadal material needed for spawning.\n \nBehavioral information has been collected and demonstrated differences in the innate dispersal patterns in early life stages of shortnose sturgeon from the [[Connecticut River]] versus those of [[Savannah River]] origin. This research suggested that shortnose sturgeon are likely behaviorally adapted to unique features of their watershed.\n\n==Major Threats to Species and Human Impact==\n\nAlthough there are now about 12,000 adult shortnose sturgeon living within the Delaware River estuary, the population faces serious human-induced threats.<ref | name=Shortnose_Sturgeon_The_Delaware_River> Conserve Wildlife Foundation of New Jersey. (2020) [http://www.conservewildlifenj.org/species/spotlight/sturgeon/] |author=Bowers-Altman, Jeanette </ref> Water quality contaminants such as endocrine distributing chemicals (EDCs) have been linked to reproductive and developmental disorders in many fish species. These contaminants were found in shortnose sturgeon tissue collected in 2001 and include PCDDs/TCDFs, DDE, PCBs, and cadmium. Other threats to Delaware River shortnose sturgeon include heavy industrialization and waterfront development. This destruction of habitat can affect the Sturgeon\u2019s ability to travel to freshwater and spawn or can degrade the quality of the habitat.<ref | name=sturgeon_c>The Red List of Threatened Species. (2004) [https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/222/13036088] |title=Shortnose Sturgeon |author= Friedland, K.D. |author= Kynard, B. |accessdate=2020-04-15 |year=2004 </ref> For example, some dams impede sturgeon travel back and forth between salt and fresh water, resulting in the disruption of natural spawning cycles and preventing the reproduction of the already struggling species.\n \nMore human-induced threats include ship/boat strikes, [[poaching]], mortality from commercial and recreational fishing (bycatch) due to high sensitivity to being caught, injury to early life stages from water intake systems, instream construction projects within the spawning area, and dredging, including the ongoing Delaware River deepening project.<ref | name=Sensitivity_of_North_American_sturgeons_and_paddlefish_to_fishing_mortality> Sturgeon Biodiversity and Conservation. (1996) [https://doi.org/10.1007/0-306-46854-9_28] |author= Boreman J. </ref> Additional research has been done to prove that [[algal blooms]], which can be caused by increased nitrogen levels in runoff or other anthropogenic factors, sometimes result in Shortnose Sturgeon die-offs.<ref | name=Saxitoxin_exposure> Marine Ecology Progress Series. (2012) [https://doi.org/10.3354/meps09768] |author=Fire, Spencer E. </ref>Overall, the combination of human-induced destruction of habitat and overconsumption have devastated many species along the Atlantic Coast. The future effects of climate change are not fully understood, however, these could potentially exacerbate many of these struggling populations even further.\n\n==Current Conservation Efforts==\nConservation efforts for the shortnose sturgeon include removing outdated dams from their habitats. The most recent recovery plan was enacted in December 1998,  for the National Marine Fisheries Service National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The stated goal of this plan is to recover populations to levels of abundance at which they no longer require protection under the ESA. For each population segment, the minimum population size will be large enough to maintain genetic diversity and avoid extinction.<ref | name=2020_biological_assessment_of_shortnose_sturgeon_e>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. (2010). [https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/17811 Five Year Plan for the Shortnose Sturgeon (''Acipenser brevirostrum'')].\u2029</ref>NOAA Fisheries work with conservation organizations, energy companies, states, tribes, and citizens to evaluate barriers\u2014big and small\u2014to improve upon fish passage.\n \nBreeding programs are currently being used to help the dwindling sturgeon populations. The fish are captured and bred to help provide important insight into the physical, chemical, and biological parameters necessary for the optimal growth, survival, and reproduction of shortnose sturgeon in the wild. Captive-bred animals are also used in permanent educational displays that promote public awareness of the plight of the species.\n \nEfforts are also being made to educate the public on the shortnose sturgeon. Scientists are working with students and teachers to learn more about the movements, behavior, and threats to sturgeons. An example of this initiative is the SCUTES program\u2014Students Collaborating to Undertake Tracking Efforts for Sturgeon. It provides lesson plans, educational kits, and an opportunity for classrooms to adopt a tagged sturgeon.\n\n==Original Recovery Plan==\nAfter listing the Shortnose Sturgeon as an endangered species in 1967, the 1998 Recovery Plan was enacted. The goal was to delist shortnose sturgeon populations throughout their range. The plan listed actions that if followed could restore the populations by the year 2024. Each of the population segments could become a candidate for downlisting when it reached a minimum population size that: 1) is large enough to prevent extinction, and 2) will make the loss of genetic diversity unlikely.  This minimum population size for each population segment had not yet been determined.<ref | name=Final_recovery_plan> National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration. (1998) [https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/15971] </ref>\nTo achieve and preserve minimum population sizes for each population segment, essential habitats were identified and maintained, and mortality, monitored and minimized. This plan has since been outdated and replaced. \n\n==5-Year Reviews==\nA Shortnose Sturgeon Status Review Team collected data and presented a \u201cA Biological Assessment of Shortnose Sturgeon\u201d to the National Marine Fisheries Service in 2010. In their assessment, the team identified aspects of Shortnose sturgeon ecology which requires continued research. Continuing research is needed in areas such as determining population size and structure, modelling larval distribution to identify effects of river manipulation by humans, and enhancing the effectiveness of mass rearing.\n \nThe team suggested the following research projects to be conducted in order to improve understanding of the shortnose sturgeons\u2019 status. Firstly, continue the survey and tracking of adults to gather additional tissue samples and detect changes in population status (abundance, residency ranges, winter ecology, and spawning success). Secondly, determine status of juveniles (an indication of recruitment) and characterize ecology and habitat use. \n \nThis review concluded that the shortnose sturgeon still requires conservation efforts to support populations. The species is still at high risk under the IUCN and ESA listings.<ref | name=2020_biological_assessment_of_shortnose_sturgeon_f>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. (2010).

A major figure in the development of post-Independence New York City and State, Varick became the [[List of mayors of New York City|45th Mayor of New York City]] in 1789 and served eleven concurrent one-year terms until 1801.<ref name=\"dlib\">{{cite web|title=Guide to the Papers of Richard Varick 1743-1871 (Bulk 1775-1830)  MS 655|url=http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/nyhs/varick/|website=dlib.nyu.edu|publisher=[[New-York Historical Society]]|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref> \n\nPrevious to his terms as mayor, Varick served as the [[Recorder of New York City|14th Recorder of New York City]] from 1784 to 1789.

Along with [[Samuel Jones (New York comptroller)|Samuel Jones]], Varick codified New York State's first statutes after Revolution in the [[Laws of New York]] (2 vols., 1789).

He was also a longtime trustee of [[Columbia University]].\n\n==Early life==\nHe was born on March 15, 1753, at [[Hackensack, New Jersey|Hackensack]] in [[Bergen County, New Jersey]] to John Varick and Jane (n\u00e9e Dey) Varick.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\">{{cite book|last1=Cushman|first1=Paul|title=Richard Varick : A Forgotten Founding Father : revolutionary war soldier, Federalist politician, mayor of New York|date=2010|publisher=Modern Memoirs|location=Amherst, MA|isbn=978-0-9772337-6-2|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aDOUOnCcpQYC}}</ref> His mother grew up in her father's house, the [[Dey Mansion]], which would go on to play a pivotal role in the revolution.\n\nBoth Varick's parents ancestors had emigrated with the [[Dutch West India Company]] in the early to mid 17th century and remained in the greater New York City area. Amongst Varick's ancestors are [[Joris Jansen Rapelje]], a member of the [[Council of Twelve Men]] which was the first democratic body in the history of the United States (1641).\n\n===Education===\nLittle is known about the specifics of Varick's education before university, though surviving letters indicate that he was educated by private tutors and studied Latin, French, and other subjects. He enrolled in King's College (the original name of [[Columbia University]]) in [[New York City]] in 1771 where he studied under [[John Morin Scott]]. Varick clerked for Scott during his education and after being admitted into the New York Bar in October 1774, Scott made him an offer to be a partner in his firm. Unusually, Varick had not yet graduated from King's College despite having passed the bar and never formally graduated. Later in his career, Varick would become a trustee of King's College for over thirty years.<ref name=\"Lefkowitz2003\">{{cite book|last=Lefkowitz|first=Arthur|title=George Washington's Indispensable Men|date=2003|publisher=Stackpole Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OHhyDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA219&lpg=PA219&dq=%22george+washington%22+%22richard+varick%22+trusted&source=bl&ots=tGR1fKUCQX&sig=ACfU3U2VhSeS7RTNhnLUqmjqSUy4gc1C8A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj3vtLDuvrkAhUYFjQIHUIzBtM4ChDoATAEegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=%22george%20washington%22%20%22richard%20varick%22%20trusted&f=false|accessdate=1 October 2019|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Military career==\n===American Revolutionary War===\n====Service under General Schuyler & Northern Army====\n[[File:Richard varick officer continental army.png|thumb|left|Richard Varick painted c.1787 by [[Ralph Earl]]. The portrait shows Varick in his Continental Army officers uniform although he retired his commission in 1783. The blue decoration is that of the Society of the Cincinnati.]] Eight months into his career in private practice, the [[American Revolutionary War]] began. At the influence of his employer, John Morin Scott, Varick suspended his studies and enlisted in the militia. On June 28, 1775, he was appointed captain of the [[1st New York Regiment]] and after only three days as field officer, was appointed military secretary under General [[Philip Schuyler]]. It was thought that Scott, understanding the administrative and intellectual value of his young partner, secured the appointment. Varick departed New York City with Schuyler on July 4, 1775, to head north to [[Fort Ticonderoga]] and launch the campaign to drive the British out of Canada. En route, the traveling party stopped in Albany briefly where Varick would first meet General [[Benedict Arnold]], who would become a good friend, also played a significant role in Varick's life until Arnold's treason in 1780.\n\nBy the summer of 1776, Schuyler had been felled by multiple illnesses and was reeling from a series of losses on the battlefield. Varick, by this juncture, in part out of necessity, and in part by appointment, was performing three jobs at once: private secretary to Schuyler, quartermaster for all the northern forts held by the Continental Army, and the Northern Army's deputy muster master general. Laterally, actual battlefield commands had been outsourced to Arnold and General [[Horatio Gates]]. Schuyler, recognizing the burden Varick was carrying, promoted him to Lieutenant Colonel. Varick's almost total control of the administration for the Northern Army lead to an even closer friendship between Arnold and Varick.\n\nThat same summer, Arnold was planning his attack effort to stop the British advance down [[Lake Champlain]] in what would be one of the first battles in the history of the [[U.S. Navy]]. With a dearth of available ships, the armada was largely built from scratch by Varick who solved the crisis by contacting his wide network in New York City and the surrounding area to send materials and coastal men who were qualified for such work. While the [[Battle of Valcour Island]] ended in defeat for the navy, it succeeded in slowing the British advance for the winter as they retreaded to their Canadian bases.\n\nVarick also faced run-ins with fellow officers who were not part of Schuyler's faction. General [[Anthony Walton White]], who had briefly served at Washington's aide-de-camp, was accused by Schuyler of looting a private home on the frontier. After denying the charges, White barged into Varick's offices and challenged him to a duel, under the impression that Varick had spoken negatively to his character. Varick, unarmed, narrowly escaped White's attempt to murder him after Varick declined the challenge. \n \nAfter the disastrous [[Battle of Saratoga]], Schuyler was removed from duty by the [[Continental Congress]] in August 1777 and replaced by General Gates. With factionalism rife within the Northern Army, Varick was aligned with Arnold which pitted him against Gates, whom he disliked regardless. Their circle of friendship had also grown to include [[Henry Brockholst Livingston]] and [[Matthew Clarkson]]. Their camaraderie was rudely defined as \"the New York gang\" by [[James Wilkinson]], a partisan of General Gates'.\n\nVarick would quietly and capably continue in his role as the Northern Army's deputy muster master general, though not as Gates' aide-de-camp or private secretary, until January 12, 1780 when the department was abolished by the Continental Congress in a larger reorganization.\n\n====Service under General Arnold====\n[[File:Benedict Arnold. Copy of engraving by H. B. Hall after John Trumbull, published 1879., 1931 - 1932 - NARA - 532921.tif|thumb|Benedict Arnold]]\nVarick briefly resumed his law in private practice, which proved challenging in his politically volatile hometown of New York City\u2014which was under occupation by the enemy. In August 1780, Benedict Arnold approached Varick about joining his staff at his newly appointed position as commanding officer of [[West Point, New York|West Point]] (then an active military instillation) as his [[aide-de-camp]] and inspector-general.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/><ref name=\"Jameson1900\">{{cite book|last1=Jameson|first1=J.

Varick, along with [[David Franks (aide-de-camp)|David Franks]], were arrested. Varick had been ill in bed when informed both of Arnold's treason and his own arrest. Contemporary reports described Varick as spending several days on the edge of madness about Arnold's defection. Despite Arnold writing to Washington personally to say that his aides were not complicit, both Varick and Franks were detained by Washington as a precautionary measure. After a court of inquiry completed its investigation, they found Varick not guilty, and delivered the following:\n\n<blockquote>\u201c''That Lieutenant Colonel Varick\u2019s conduct with respect to the base Peculations and Treasonable Practices of the late General Arnold is not only unimpeachable but think him entitled (throughout every part of his conduct) to a degree of Merit that does him great honor as an Officer and particularly distinguishes him as a sincere Friend to his Country\u2026''\u201d</blockquote>\n\n====Service under General Washington====\nA by-product of the above was the introduction of Varick to [[George Washington]], which would lead to the two working together for the rest of their careers, and lives. This relationship began in 1781 when Washington petitioned the Continental Congress to establish team of writers to record and preserve all of his, and the army's, papers, planning, and correspondence for use by future generations. This would be under the supervision \u201cof a Man of character in whom entire confidence can be placed\u201d. Washington appointed Varick in this role, which made use of his highly respected administrative skills, and would fully rehabilitate his name after the Arnold scandal. Establishing his office at [[Poughkeepsie]], Varick and his assistants spent more than two years in compiling the forty-four folio volumes known as the [[Varick Transcripts]]. Varick served under Washington solely until Washington retired his commission in 1783.<ref name=\"albanyinstitute\">{{cite web|title=Colonel Richard Varick (1753-1831)|url=http://www.albanyinstitute.org/details/items/colonel-richard-varick-1753-1831.html|website=www.albanyinstitute.org|publisher=[[Albany Institute of History and Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"metmuseum\">{{cite web|title=Relates to General Richard Montgomery {{!}} Letter from Richard Varick to DeWitt Clinton, Governor of New York, requesting repayment of cash he has advanced for expenditures relating to the Internment<!--sic--> of the Remains of the late General Montgomery {{!}} The Met|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/667757|website=metmuseum.org|publisher=[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nUpon completing the assigned duties after years or work, General Washington wrote:\n<blockquote>\u201c''I take this first opportunity of signifying my entire approbation of the manner in which you have executed the important duties of recording secretary; and the satisfaction I feel in having my papers so properly arranged, and so correctly recorded; and beg you will accept my thanks for the care and attention which you have given to this business and beg you be persuaded, that I shall take pleasure in asserting on every occasion, the sense of entertainment of the fidelity, skill and indefatigable industry manifested by you in the performance of your public duties''.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Writings of Washington|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/cu31924092900400/cu31924092900400_djvu.txt|website=www.archive.org|pages=113\u2013114|publisher=New York Free Press|accessdate=16 October 2019}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter he retired from his service in the Continental Army, Varick would remain in service as a colonel in the [[New York State Militia]] until 1801.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/>\n\n=====<div style=\"text-align: center;\">The Varick Transcripts</div>=====\nThe Varick Transcripts are deposited in the [[Library of Congress]].

During his term as a member of the New York State Assembly, he was [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly|Speaker]] during the sessions of 1787 and 1788. Varick was appointed the [[New York State Attorney General]] from 1788 to 1789.\n\nRemarkably, due to the elitist nature of the [[New York Constitution|New York State Constitution of 1777]], almost all government positions in the city and state of New York were appointed by the [[Council of Appointment]]. Few, if any, general elections or other democratic functions would exist until 1802. Thus, in the year 1788, Varick was simultaneously the Recorder of New York City, a State Assemblyman representing New York City, the Speaker of the House of the State of New York, and the Attorney General of the State of New York. Though Varick is on record protesting the egregious nature of his occupying multiple offices, it was rationalized at the time that as both an expert administrator and lawyer, he was an ideal choice to fill these myriad offices and to build swiftly the various mechanisms of government. And, that the subsequent laws were codified quickly in the nascent days of an independent New York City and State to ensure the function, and growth, of both entities.\n\n===Mayor of New York City===\n[[File:Richard Varick Signature 1796.jpg|thumb|right|Signature of Richard Varick while Mayor of New York (1798)]]\nMost notably, Varick was the [[Mayor of New York City]] for twelve years during the formative post-Independence era from 1789 to 1801.<ref name=\"Marcus1985\">{{cite book|last1=Marcus|first1=Maeva|last2=Perry|first2=James R.|title=The Documentary History of the Supreme Court of the United States, 1789-1800: Suits against states|date=1985|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|isbn=9780231088725|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7jhBkyoKSUC&pg=PA107&lpg=PA107|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> While Mayor, he focused on the yellow fever epidemics which struck repeatedly.\n\n==Philanthropy & Charity==\n===American Bible Society===\nVarick was a founder of the [[American Bible Society]] in 1816.<ref name=\"sunypress\">{{cite web|title=Richard Varick: A Forgotten Founding Father|url=https://www.sunypress.edu/p-5293-richard-varick-a-forgotten-foun.aspx|website=www.sunypress.edu|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Wosh1994\">{{cite book|last1=Wosh|first1=Peter J.|title=Spreading the Word: The Bible Business in Nineteenth-century America|date=1994|publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]|isbn=0801429285|url=https://archive.org/details/spreadingwordbib00wosh|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/spreadingwordbib00wosh/page/16 16]|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> He would later become president (succeeding [[John Jay]]) in 1828 until his death in 1831.\n\n===Society of the Cincinnati===\nHe was an original member of the [[Society of the Cincinnati]] beginning in 1783, and president of the New York chapter until his death.

He was also a longtime trustee of [[Columbia University]].\n\n==Early life==\nHe was born on March 15, 1753, at [[Hackensack, New Jersey|Hackensack]] in [[Bergen County, New Jersey]] to John Varick and Jane (n\u00e9e Dey) Varick.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\">{{cite book|last1=Cushman|first1=Paul|title=Richard Varick : A Forgotten Founding Father : revolutionary war soldier, Federalist politician, mayor of New York|date=2010|publisher=Modern Memoirs|location=Amherst, MA|isbn=978-0-9772337-6-2|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aDOUOnCcpQYC}}</ref> His mother grew up in her father's house, the [[Dey Mansion]], which would go on to play a pivotal role in the revolution.\n\nBoth Varick's parents ancestors had emigrated with the [[Dutch West India Company]] in the early to mid 17th century and remained in the greater New York City area. Amongst Varick's ancestors are [[Joris Jansen Rapelje]], a member of the [[Council of Twelve Men]] which was the first democratic body in the history of the United States (1641).\n\n===Education===\nLittle is known about the specifics of Varick's education before university, though surviving letters indicate that he was educated by private tutors and studied Latin, French, and other subjects. He enrolled in King's College (the original name of [[Columbia University]]) in [[New York City]] in 1771 where he studied under [[John Morin Scott]]. Varick clerked for Scott during his education and after being admitted into the New York Bar in October 1774, Scott made him an offer to be a partner in his firm. Unusually, Varick had not yet graduated from King's College despite having passed the bar and never formally graduated. Later in his career, Varick would become a trustee of King's College for over thirty years.<ref name=\"Lefkowitz2003\">{{cite book|last=Lefkowitz|first=Arthur|title=George Washington's Indispensable Men|date=2003|publisher=Stackpole Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OHhyDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA219&lpg=PA219&dq=%22george+washington%22+%22richard+varick%22+trusted&source=bl&ots=tGR1fKUCQX&sig=ACfU3U2VhSeS7RTNhnLUqmjqSUy4gc1C8A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj3vtLDuvrkAhUYFjQIHUIzBtM4ChDoATAEegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=%22george%20washington%22%20%22richard%20varick%22%20trusted&f=false|accessdate=1 October 2019|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Military career==\n===American Revolutionary War===\n====Service under General Schuyler & Northern Army====\n[[File:Richard varick officer continental army.png|thumb|left|Richard Varick painted c.1787 by [[Ralph Earl]]. The portrait shows Varick in his Continental Army officers uniform although he retired his commission in 1783. The blue decoration is that of the Society of the Cincinnati.]] Eight months into his career in private practice, the [[American Revolutionary War]] began. At the influence of his employer, John Morin Scott, Varick suspended his studies and enlisted in the militia. On June 28, 1775, he was appointed captain of the [[1st New York Regiment]] and after only three days as field officer, was appointed military secretary under General [[Philip Schuyler]]. It was thought that Scott, understanding the administrative and intellectual value of his young partner, secured the appointment. Varick departed New York City with Schuyler on July 4, 1775, to head north to [[Fort Ticonderoga]] and launch the campaign to drive the British out of Canada. En route, the traveling party stopped in Albany briefly where Varick would first meet General [[Benedict Arnold]], who would become a good friend, also played a significant role in Varick's life until Arnold's treason in 1780.\n\nBy the summer of 1776, Schuyler had been felled by multiple illnesses and was reeling from a series of losses on the battlefield. Varick, by this juncture, in part out of necessity, and in part by appointment, was performing three jobs at once: private secretary to Schuyler, quartermaster for all the northern forts held by the Continental Army, and the Northern Army's deputy muster master general. Laterally, actual battlefield commands had been outsourced to Arnold and General [[Horatio Gates]]. Schuyler, recognizing the burden Varick was carrying, promoted him to Lieutenant Colonel. Varick's almost total control of the administration for the Northern Army lead to an even closer friendship between Arnold and Varick.\n\nThat same summer, Arnold was planning his attack effort to stop the British advance down [[Lake Champlain]] in what would be one of the first battles in the history of the [[U.S. Navy]]. With a dearth of available ships, the armada was largely built from scratch by Varick who solved the crisis by contacting his wide network in New York City and the surrounding area to send materials and coastal men who were qualified for such work. While the [[Battle of Valcour Island]] ended in defeat for the navy, it succeeded in slowing the British advance for the winter as they retreaded to their Canadian bases.\n\nVarick also faced run-ins with fellow officers who were not part of Schuyler's faction. General [[Anthony Walton White]], who had briefly served at Washington's aide-de-camp, was accused by Schuyler of looting a private home on the frontier. After denying the charges, White barged into Varick's offices and challenged him to a duel, under the impression that Varick had spoken negatively to his character. Varick, unarmed, narrowly escaped White's attempt to murder him after Varick declined the challenge. \n \nAfter the disastrous [[Battle of Saratoga]], Schuyler was removed from duty by the [[Continental Congress]] in August 1777 and replaced by General Gates. With factionalism rife within the Northern Army, Varick was aligned with Arnold which pitted him against Gates, whom he disliked regardless. Their circle of friendship had also grown to include [[Henry Brockholst Livingston]] and [[Matthew Clarkson]]. Their camaraderie was rudely defined as \"the New York gang\" by [[James Wilkinson]], a partisan of General Gates'.\n\nVarick would quietly and capably continue in his role as the Northern Army's deputy muster master general, though not as Gates' aide-de-camp or private secretary, until January 12, 1780 when the department was abolished by the Continental Congress in a larger reorganization.\n\n====Service under General Arnold====\n[[File:Benedict Arnold. Copy of engraving by H. B. Hall after John Trumbull, published 1879., 1931 - 1932 - NARA - 532921.tif|thumb|Benedict Arnold]]\nVarick briefly resumed his law in private practice, which proved challenging in his politically volatile hometown of New York City\u2014which was under occupation by the enemy. In August 1780, Benedict Arnold approached Varick about joining his staff at his newly appointed position as commanding officer of [[West Point, New York|West Point]] (then an active military instillation) as his [[aide-de-camp]] and inspector-general.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/><ref name=\"Jameson1900\">{{cite book|last1=Jameson|first1=J.

Varick, along with [[David Franks (aide-de-camp)|David Franks]], were arrested. Varick had been ill in bed when informed both of Arnold's treason and his own arrest. Contemporary reports described Varick as spending several days on the edge of madness about Arnold's defection. Despite Arnold writing to Washington personally to say that his aides were not complicit, both Varick and Franks were detained by Washington as a precautionary measure. After a court of inquiry completed its investigation, they found Varick not guilty, and delivered the following:\n\n<blockquote>\u201c''That Lieutenant Colonel Varick\u2019s conduct with respect to the base Peculations and Treasonable Practices of the late General Arnold is not only unimpeachable but think him entitled (throughout every part of his conduct) to a degree of Merit that does him great honor as an Officer and particularly distinguishes him as a sincere Friend to his Country\u2026''\u201d</blockquote>\n\n====Service under General Washington====\nA by-product of the above was the introduction of Varick to [[George Washington]], which would lead to the two working together for the rest of their careers, and lives. This relationship began in 1781 when Washington petitioned the Continental Congress to establish team of writers to record and preserve all of his, and the army's, papers, planning, and correspondence for use by future generations. This would be under the supervision \u201cof a Man of character in whom entire confidence can be placed\u201d. Washington appointed Varick in this role, which made use of his highly respected administrative skills, and would fully rehabilitate his name after the Arnold scandal. Establishing his office at [[Poughkeepsie]], Varick and his assistants spent more than two years in compiling the forty-four folio volumes known as the [[Varick Transcripts]]. Varick served under Washington solely until Washington retired his commission in 1783.<ref name=\"albanyinstitute\">{{cite web|title=Colonel Richard Varick (1753-1831)|url=http://www.albanyinstitute.org/details/items/colonel-richard-varick-1753-1831.html|website=www.albanyinstitute.org|publisher=[[Albany Institute of History and Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"metmuseum\">{{cite web|title=Relates to General Richard Montgomery {{!}} Letter from Richard Varick to DeWitt Clinton, Governor of New York, requesting repayment of cash he has advanced for expenditures relating to the Internment<!--sic--> of the Remains of the late General Montgomery {{!}} The Met|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/667757|website=metmuseum.org|publisher=[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nUpon completing the assigned duties after years or work, General Washington wrote:\n<blockquote>\u201c''I take this first opportunity of signifying my entire approbation of the manner in which you have executed the important duties of recording secretary; and the satisfaction I feel in having my papers so properly arranged, and so correctly recorded; and beg you will accept my thanks for the care and attention which you have given to this business and beg you be persuaded, that I shall take pleasure in asserting on every occasion, the sense of entertainment of the fidelity, skill and indefatigable industry manifested by you in the performance of your public duties''.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Writings of Washington|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/cu31924092900400/cu31924092900400_djvu.txt|website=www.archive.org|pages=113\u2013114|publisher=New York Free Press|accessdate=16 October 2019}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter he retired from his service in the Continental Army, Varick would remain in service as a colonel in the [[New York State Militia]] until 1801.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/>\n\n=====<div style=\"text-align: center;\">The Varick Transcripts</div>=====\nThe Varick Transcripts are deposited in the [[Library of Congress]].

During his term as a member of the New York State Assembly, he was [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly|Speaker]] during the sessions of 1787 and 1788. Varick was appointed the [[New York State Attorney General]] from 1788 to 1789.\n\nRemarkably, due to the elitist nature of the [[New York Constitution|New York State Constitution of 1777]], almost all government positions in the city and state of New York were appointed by the [[Council of Appointment]]. Few, if any, general elections or other democratic functions would exist until 1802. Thus, in the year 1788, Varick was simultaneously the Recorder of New York City, a State Assemblyman representing New York City, the Speaker of the House of the State of New York, and the Attorney General of the State of New York. Though Varick is on record protesting the egregious nature of his occupying multiple offices, it was rationalized at the time that as both an expert administrator and lawyer, he was an ideal choice to fill these myriad offices and to build swiftly the various mechanisms of government. And, that the subsequent laws were codified quickly in the nascent days of an independent New York City and State to ensure the function, and growth, of both entities.\n\n===Mayor of New York City===\n[[File:Richard Varick Signature 1796.jpg|thumb|right|Signature of Richard Varick while Mayor of New York (1798)]]\nMost notably, Varick was the [[Mayor of New York City]] for twelve years during the formative post-Independence era from 1789 to 1801.<ref name=\"Marcus1985\">{{cite book|last1=Marcus|first1=Maeva|last2=Perry|first2=James R.|title=The Documentary History of the Supreme Court of the United States, 1789-1800: Suits against states|date=1985|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|isbn=9780231088725|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7jhBkyoKSUC&pg=PA107&lpg=PA107|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> While Mayor, he focused on the yellow fever epidemics which struck repeatedly.\n\n==Philanthropy & Charity==\n===American Bible Society===\nVarick was a founder of the [[American Bible Society]] in 1816.<ref name=\"sunypress\">{{cite web|title=Richard Varick: A Forgotten Founding Father|url=https://www.sunypress.edu/p-5293-richard-varick-a-forgotten-foun.aspx|website=www.sunypress.edu|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Wosh1994\">{{cite book|last1=Wosh|first1=Peter J.|title=Spreading the Word: The Bible Business in Nineteenth-century America|date=1994|publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]|isbn=0801429285|url=https://archive.org/details/spreadingwordbib00wosh|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/spreadingwordbib00wosh/page/16 16]|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> He would later become president (succeeding [[John Jay]]) in 1828 until his death in 1831.\n\n===Society of the Cincinnati===\nHe was an original member of the [[Society of the Cincinnati]] beginning in 1783, and president of the New York chapter until his death.
