It was the first domestically built compact pickup of the big three American automakers. When it was first introduced as a  \"quarter-ton pickup\" in 1981 for the 1982 model year, the [[GMC (General Motors division)|GMC]] version was known as the '''S-15''' and later renamed the '''GMC Sonoma'''. A high-performance version was released in 1991 and given the name of [[GMC Syclone]]. The pickup was also sold by [[Isuzu]] as the '''Hombre''' from 1996 through 2000, but only in North America. There was also an [[SUV]] version, the [[Chevrolet S-10 Blazer|Chevrolet S-10 Blazer/GMC S-15 Jimmy]]. An [[Chevrolet S-10 EV|electric version]] was leased as a fleet vehicle in 1997 and 1998. Together, these pickups are often referred to as the '''S-series'''.\n\nIn North America, the S-series was replaced by the [[Chevrolet Colorado]], GMC Canyon, and [[Chevrolet Colorado#Isuzu i-series|Isuzu i-Series]] in 2004.\n\nThe S-Series ended production in Brazil in 2012, being replaced by the [[Chevrolet Colorado]], but still with the name S-10.\n\n{{TOC left}}\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==First generation (1982\u20131993)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = First generation\n| image = 1992 Chevrolet S-10 Tahoe.jpg\n| production = 1981&ndash;1993\n| model_years = 1982&ndash;1993\n| aka = {{unbulleted list|GMC S-15|GMC Sonoma}}\n| engine = {{unbulleted list |1.9 L ''[[List of Isuzu engines#LR1|LR1]]'' [[Straight-4|I4]] ([[gasoline]])|2.0 L ''[[General Motors 122 engine#LQ2|LQ2]]'' [[Straight-4|I4]] (gasoline)|2.2 L ''[[List of Isuzu engines#LQ7|LQ7]]'' [[Straight-4|I4]] ([[diesel fuel|diesel]])|2.5 L ''[[Iron Duke engine|L38]]'' [[Straight-4|I4]] (gasoline)|2.5 L ''[[Iron Duke engine|LN8]]'' [[Straight-4|I4]] (gasoline)|2.8 L ''[[General Motors 60\u00b0 V6 engine#LR2|LR2]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]] (gasoline)|2.8 L ''[[General Motors 60\u00b0 V6 engine#LL2|LL2]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]] (gasoline)|4.3 L ''[[General Motors 90\u00b0 V6 engine#L35 CPI|L35]]'' [[V6]] (gasoline)|4.3 L ''[[General Motors 90\u00b0 V6 engine#LB1 and LB4|LB4]]'' [[V6]] (gasoline)}}\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list |3-speed ''[[Turbo-Hydramatic#THM200|THM-200C]]'' automatic|4-speed [[Isuzu]] ''S101'' manual|4-speed [[Borg-Warner]] ''T4'' manual|4-speed  ''[[Turbo-Hydramatic#700R4 .2F 4L60 .2F 4L60E .2F 4L65E|700R4]]'' automatic|4-speed  ''[[Turbo-Hydramatic#700R4 .2F 4L60 .2F 4L60E .2F 4L65E|4L60]]'' automatic||4-speed  ''[[Turbo-Hydramatic#700R4 .2F 4L60 .2F 4L60E .2F 4L65E|4L60-E]]'' automatic|5-speed [[Getrag]] ''290'' manual|5-speed ''5LM60'' manual|5-speed ''[[New Venture Gear 3500 transmission|NV3500]]'' manual|5-speed [[Borg Warner]] ''[[Borg-Warner T-5 transmission|T5]]'' manual}}\n| assembly = United States: [[Moraine, Ohio]] ([[Moraine Assembly]])<br>[[Shreveport, Louisiana]] ([[Shreveport Operations|Shreveport Assembly]])<br>[[Pontiac, Michigan]]|Canada: [[Ingersoll, Ontario]] ([[CAMI Automotive]])<br>[[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]]\n| platform = [[GM GMT platform#GMT 325/330|GMT325]]\n| wheelbase = {{unbulleted list |{{convert|108.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (reg. cab short bed)|{{convert|117.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (reg. cab long bed)|{{convert|122.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (ext. cab short bed)}}\n| related = {{unbulleted list |[[Chevrolet S-10 Blazer|Chevrolet S-10 Blazer / GMC S15 Jimmy]]|[[GMC Syclone]]|[[GMC Typhoon]]|[[Oldsmobile Bravada]]|[[Grumman LLV]]}}\n}}\n\n[[File:1st GMC Sonoma -- 09-28-2011.jpg|thumb|left|1991\u20131994 GMC Sonoma ST extended cab]]\n[[File:1st-Chevrolet-S10.jpg|thumb|left|1982\u20131990 Chevrolet S-10 single cab]]\n[[File:GMC-Sonoma.jpg|thumb|left|1982\u20131990 GMC S-15 single cab]]\n\nThe first compact truck from the big three automakers was the rebadged [[Isuzu KB]] sold since 1972 as the [[Chevrolet LUV]], and Ford quickly responded with the [[Mazda B-Series#Second generation (1965\u20131977)|Mazda-built Ford Courier]] the same year. However, the 1973 Arab oil embargo forced GM to consider designing a domestically produced compact pickup truck.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} As usual, parts from other GM chassis lines (primarily from the [[GM G platform (RWD)|GM G-body]] [[mid-size car|intermediates]]) were incorporated. Track width was similar to the former [[GM H platform (RWD)|GM H-body]] [[subcompact]]s ([[Chevrolet Vega|Vega]]/[[Chevrolet Monza|Monza]]). The first S-series pickups were introduced in 1981 for the 1982 model year. The base engine (manufactured in Japan and imported) was a 1.9 L Isuzu four-cylinder (RPO LR1) shared with the LUV and Isuzu P'UP, with a 2.8 L V6 as an option. The Chevrolet and GMC models were identical apart from the grille, tailgate and assorted insignia. An extended cab and \"Insta-Trac\" four-wheel drive were added the next year along with two new engines - a 2.0 L four-cylinder engine (RPO LQ2) from the [[GM J platform|J-platform]] automobiles along with an Isuzu 2.2 L (RPO LQ7) four-cylinder diesel engine.\n\nThe sport utility [[Chevrolet S-10 Blazer|S-10 Blazer and S-15 Jimmy]] debuted for 1983; GM was the first to introduce the compact sport utility, followed by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and then [[Jeep]] in 1984. Following the popularity of the [[Jeep_Cherokee_(XJ)|Jeep Cherokee]], 4-door [[SUV]] variants were introduced in March 1990 as 1991 [[model year|models]] alongside the badge-engineered [[Oldsmobile Bravada]]. \n\nNew heavy-duty and off-road suspensions appeared in 1984 along with a hydraulic clutch, while the big news for 1985 was the discontinuation of the [[Chevrolet Cavalier|Cavalier]]'s 2.0 L OHV [[Straight-4|I4]] in favor of [[Pontiac]]'s 2.5 L \"Iron Duke\" OHV I4. The OHV-derived 2.2 L diesel engine and 1.9 [[Liter|L]] SOHC gas engine, both from Isuzu, were gone the next year, leaving just the Iron Duke and updated 2.8 L [[V6]]. A much-welcomed 4.3 L V6 was added for 1988, and [[anti-lock brakes]] came the next year.\n \nThe GMC S-15 became the GMC Sonoma in 1991, and the Sierra trim packages were dropped to avoid confusion with the new GMC Sierra [[full-size]] pickup. The GMC Syclone also appeared that year. The Sonoma GT bowed in 1992. Added to this was the 4.3 L V6 Vortec W-code engine. This generation's last year was 1993.\n\n===Appearance packages===\nThe S-10 Baja is an optional appearance package that was put on any four-wheel drive S-10 (regular-cab with short-box, regular-cab with long box and extended-cab with short box) from 1989 to 1991. The Baja was available in three colors: Midnight Black, Apple Red and Frost White. The Baja option also included: a roll bar with off-road lights, front tubular grille guard with fog lights, tubular rear bumper, an underbody shield package (transfer case shield, front differential shield, fuel tank shield, oil pan/steering linkage shields), a suspension package, Chevrolet windshield banner, Baja decals on the box sides and one inch wide body striping. Extra cost Baja options included a cargo-net end-gate, aluminum \"Outlaw\" wheels and a special box-mounted spare tire carrier with aluminum wheel. In 1991 the S10 Bajas came with special \"BAJA\" embroidered red and grey bucket seats and unique red door panel trim.\n\nThe S-10 Cameo and Cameo EL were appearance packages available for the two-wheel drive S-10 between 1989 and 1991. When first introduced in 1989, the Cameo had three color choices; Apple Red, Frost White or Midnight Black. In 1991, two-tone paint schemes were available, as well as additional exterior features such as a wraparound front bumper with fog lamps, lower body ground-effects moldings and wheel flares, a flush-fitting tailgate valance, rear roll pan (state laws permitting), and \"Cameo\" lettering on the doors and tailgate. Other appearance packages included the S-10 Back Country, predecessor to the Baja, the S-10 Top Gun edition, the GMC Sonoma SST, the GMC S-15 Gypsy Magic and GMC Jimmy Magic.\n\n===Sonoma GT===\n[https://www.hemmings.com/blog/2016/03/07/faster-than-a-corvette-gmcs-syclone-sport-truck-celebrates-a-quarter-century/|thumb|left|Syclone]\nThe '''Sonoma GT''' was a performance package available on the two-wheel drive regular cab short bed Sonoma. A total of 806 were built.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The truck was powered by an enhanced Vortec 4.3&nbsp;L V6.

For 1993 no specialty labeling or limited edition tags were known to be used with the W-code engine. Production totals for these vehicles are unknown.\n\n===1991 Syclone===\n{{Main|GMC Syclone}}\nThe Syclone was a high performance package for the 1991 model year. It came with all wheel drive, 4-wheel anti-lock brakes, a 4.3 L [[Chevrolet 90-degree V6 engine#LB4|LB4]]  V6 with lower compression pistons, a turbocharger and water intercooler system, They produced ~280&nbsp;hp.

Version (Second Facelift)]]\n\nThe second-generation trucks arrived for the 1994 model year. All of the special models (the Syclone, Typhoon, and Sonoma GT) were discontinued, but the changes to the pickup brought it in line with its major competitor the [[Ford Ranger]]. The Iron Duke 4-cylinder and 2.8&nbsp;L 60\u00b0 V6 engines were retired, the 4.3&nbsp;L Vortec V6 was enhanced, and a new 2.2&nbsp;L 4-cylinder engine (which had been introduced in 1990 on various front-wheel drive GM compact and mid-size platforms) became the engines of choice to power the second generation of S-10s. In compliance with the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], all second generation S-10s and Sonomas equipped with air conditioning used CFC-free R134a refrigerant beginning in the 1994 model year. The all new 1994 S-10 didn't offer any airbag, presumably as a temporary measure to economize the introduction of the new body styles, as well as to gradually phase out steering wheel designs that didn't accommodate for airbags, though the vehicle itself was slated for airbag capability.\n\nMany of the chassis components were the same as the first generation (the A-frames between the first and second generation were the same although they were originally sourced from GM's [[GM G platform (RWD)|G-body]] vehicle lineup), along with the steering knuckle, leaf springs, and differential assembly but suspension and axles were greatly enhanced. Lower A-frames for the two-wheel drive model had 1/4-inch thicker steering stops - the second generation A-frames are commonly used as an upgrade for the first generation. [[Sport utility vehicle|Sport utility]] models (Blazer, Jimmy, Bravada) came with thicker front and rear sway bars.\n\nGenerally, for the two-wheel drive trucks, the 8.5-inch rear end was only used when it came with both a [[manual transmission]] and the L35 W-code {{convert|262|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[V6 engine]]; it was an option for four-wheel drive trucks with either [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]]. This was also the year that GM introduced the [[RPO ZR2|ZR2 off-road package]].\n\nFor 1995, a driver's side air bag was added as well as daytime running lights. In 1996 the 4.3&nbsp;L engine was refreshed, and a third (rear) door was added for extended cab models, along with the sportside bed option. In 1998, the exterior, interior<ref>http://oldcarbrochures.org/November%202019/1998%20Chevrolet%20S-10%20Pickup/slides/1998%20Chevrolet%20S-10%20Pickup-00a-01.html</ref>, brakes, and 2.2&nbsp;L [[Straight-4|I4]] engine were refreshed, along with a \"next-generation\" supplemental restraint system that added a passenger-side air bag. The SS package was replaced by the \"Xtreme\" package. In 2001, a crew cab option was added and was only available with four-wheel drive and an [[automatic transmission]]. For the 2004 model year, the regular and extended cab models were discontinued, only the crew cab model was retained with production ending in December 2003.\n\nBase two-wheel drive models came with 15 x 6.5-inch wheels with directional vents, Xtreme and [[ZQ8]] models came with 16 x 8-inch wheels while four-wheel drive models (including the [[RPO ZR2|ZR2]]) used 15 x 7-inch wheels.  The {{convert|14|in|mm|adj=on}} wheels used on the first generation were discontinued.\n\n===SS===\nThe Chevrolet S-10 SS was a high-performance version of the S-10, introduced in 1994.  Fewer than 3,000 SSs were produced yearly on average.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} When introduced, the SS was only sold in three colors: Onyx Black, Summit White, and Apple Red.  The SS was discontinued in 1998 and was replaced by the S-10 Xtreme for the 1999 model year.\n\nA 4.3 L V6 (which was optional on regular S-10s) was the standard engine used in the SS, producing between 180 and {{Convert|200|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The SS included a limited slip differential, lowered suspension (starting with the 1996 model year), cosmetic changes such as a different grille, body-colored bumpers, 16-inch wheels (available from 1996 to 1998, similar in design to the 1991 and 1992 Camaro Z28 with Chevrolet \"bowtie\" logo center caps), and other minor cosmetic differences.  All SS versions were regular cabs, Xtremes were available with the \"third door\" extended cab. A step-side version was available from 1996 to 1998 and until 2003 on the Xtreme.\n\n[[File:2001 Chevrolet S-10 ZR2.JPG|thumb|2001 Chevrolet S-10 ZR2]]\n[[File:Green sonoma.jpg|thumb|1994\u20131997 GMC Sonoma regular cab]]\n\n===ZR2===\nThe ZR2 package was an off-road package available for the second generation S-10.  The ZR2 package included a {{Convert|4|in|mm|adj=on}} wider track width, a boxed ladder-type frame with modified suspension mounting points, larger wheel and axle bearings, 31-inch all-terrain tires, a suspension lift (approximately 3&nbsp;inches more ground clearance versus a regular four-wheel drive S-10), upgraded Bilstein suspension, fender flares, alloy wheels, and an 8.5-inch Chevrolet 10-bolt rear differential with 3.73:1 gears and an Eaton MLocker (coded as G80). {{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n===Isuzu Hombre===\n[[File:96-97 Isuzu Hombre 2.jpg|200px|thumb|left|1996\u20131997 Isuzu Hombre single cab]]\n\nIn 1996, [[Isuzu]] replaced its [[Isuzu Faster|P'up]] with a version of the Louisiana-built Chevrolet S-10, the '''Isuzu Hombre''', based on the Brazilian market S-10 (the front grille and fenders are based on the Brazilian S-10 along with the truck bed sheetmetal). The Hombre differed from its GM siblings mostly in the front sheetmetal, with different lights, grille, front bumper and front fenders, which were more flared out. The rear quarter panels were also different, as they had a slight flare over the wheel well to match the front fenders. The Hombre had a much smaller range of equipment options compared to the S-10 and Sonoma; a''Spacecab'' extended cab, V6 engine and four-wheel drive were added for 1997 and available until 1998.\n\nTwo trim levels were offered: the base S and the uplevel XS. The XS had features like a cassette tape deck, higher-grade interior fabric, a tachometer, sliding rear window, and a split 60/40 seatback. Hombres were equipped with the Chevrolet S-series 15 x 7 steel wheels (with 8 directional vents) - the Hombre wheels were painted black (the S10, Sonoma, and Blazer/Jimmy wheels were painted silver) since a majority were equipped with wheel covers with the Isuzu logo. Hombres were also available with the S-10's aluminum wheels with Isuzu center caps.\n\nSlow sales resulted in production ending in 2000. It would be another six years before Isuzu re-entered the pick-up market with the [[Chevrolet Colorado#Isuzu i series|i-Series]], which formed the basis for the S-10's successor, the [[Chevrolet Colorado|Colorado]].\n{{clear}}\n\n===Engines===\n<ref>{{cite book|title=Chevrolet S-10 Product Brochures|year=1994\u20132004}}</ref>\n{| class=wikitable\n!Years\n!Engine\n!Power\n!Torque\n!VIN letter\n|-\n|1994\u20132000, 2003||2.2 L ''[[GM 122 engine#LN2|Vortec 2200 (LN2)]]'' [[Straight-4|I4]]||{{Convert|110-120|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 5200 RPM||{{convert|130|-|140|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 2800 RPM||4\n|-\n|2000-2002||2.2 L ''[[GM 122 engine#L43|Vortec 2200 (L43)]]'' [[Straight-4|I4]]||{{Convert|120|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 5000 RPM||{{convert|140|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 3600 RPM||5\n|-\n|1994||rowspan=2|4.3 L ''[[Chevrolet 90-Degree V6 engine#LB4|90\u00b0 (LB4)]]'' [[V-6 engine|V-6]], [[Fuel injection#Throttle body injection|TBI]]||{{Convert|165|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 4000 RPM|| rowspan=\"2\" |{{convert|235|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 2400 RPM||rowspan=2|Z\n|-\n|1995||{{Convert|155|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 4000 RPM\n|-\n|1994|| rowspan=4|4.3 L ''[[Chevrolet 90-degree V6 engine#L35|Vortec 4300 (L35)]]'' [[V-6 engine|V-6]], [[Fuel injection#Central port injection|SCPI]]||{{convert|200|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 4500 rpm||{{convert|260|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 3600 rpm|| rowspan=\"4\" |W\n|-\n|1995||{{convert|190|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 4500 rpm||{{convert|260|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 3400 rpm\n|-\n|1996-2002 w/ 2WD||{{Convert|180|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 4400 RPM||{{convert|245|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 2800 RPM\n|-\n|1996-2002 w/ 4WD||{{Convert|190|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 4400 RPM||{{convert|250|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 2800 RPM\n|-\n|1996-1999 w/ 2WD||rowspan=2|4.3 L ''[[Chevrolet 90-degree V6 engine#LF6|Vortec 4300 (LF6)]]'' [[V-6 engine|V-6]], [[Fuel injection#Multi port fuel injection|MPFI]]||{{Convert|175|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 4400 RPM|| rowspan=\"2\" |{{convert|240|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 2800 RPM||rowspan=2|X<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://service.gm.com/dealerworld/vincards/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-08-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161125081638/https://service.gm.com/dealerworld/vincards/ |archive-date=2016-11-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n|-\n|1996-1999 w/ 4WD||{{Convert|180|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 4400 RPM\n|-\n|2003 w/ 2WD||rowspan=2|4.3 L ''[[Chevrolet 90-degree V6 engine#LU3|Vortec 4300 (LU3)]]'' [[V-6 engine|V-6]], [[Fuel injection#Multiport fuel injection|MPFI]]||{{Convert|180|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 4400 RPM||{{convert|245|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 2800 RPM||rowspan=2|X\n|-\n|2003-2004 w/ 4WD||{{Convert|190-200|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 5400 RPM||{{convert|260|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 2800 RPM\n|}\n\n==Third generation (2012\u2013present)==\n{{see also|Chevrolet Colorado#Second generation}}\n{{Infobox automobile\n|image=Brazilian 2012 All-New Chevy S10.jpg\n|name=Third generation\n|production=2012\u2013present\n|aka=[[GMC Canyon]] <br>Isuzu I Series<br>[[Chevrolet Colorado]](North America)<br>[[Holden Colorado]] (Australia)<br> HSV SportsCat (Australia) <br> [[Isuzu D-Max]]\n}}\n[[File:Patrullero_de_Rosario,_Santa_Fe.jpg|thumb|left|facelift]]\nAlthough the North American version of the S-series was discontinued in 2004, the second generation S-10 was still being built in Brazil until 2012, when it was replaced by a Brazilian-built version of the [[Chevrolet Colorado]] called the S-10.\n\nIn Brazil, until 2014, the third generation S-10 offered a 2.4 L 147&nbsp;hp ''[[Family II engine|Flexpower]]'' [[flex-fuel]] engine or a 2.8 L 180&nbsp;hp ''[[List of VM Motori engines#A 428 DOHC|Duramax]]'' diesel engine. For 2015 models, the diesel engine was refreshed, resulting in an increased power output of 200&nbsp;hp. The flex-fuel (gasoline/ethanol) engine had an upgrade for some versions (LT and LTZ) and offered 206&nbsp;hp with a 2.5 L [[GM Ecotec engine#LCV|LCV Ecotec]] with [[direct fuel injection]]. Also, for the first time in Brazil, Chevrolet offered the [[Flexible-fuel vehicle|flex-fuel]] S-10 with four-wheel drive.\n\nFor the 2017 model, the S-10 received a facelift and the flex-fuel 2.4 L engine was dropped, with the remaining engine choices being unchanged. For 2018, the flex-fuel S-10 now offers an automatic transmission, currently the market trend on these vehicles in Brazil.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nA right-hand-drive version of the 2017+ facelifted model is built at the GM Thailand plant and sold in Australia and New Zealand as the current-model [[Chevrolet Colorado|Holden Colorado.]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category inline|Chevrolet S-10}}\n\n{{Chevrolet Truck}}\n{{GMC}}\n{{Chevrolet vehicles}}\n{{Isuzu Commercial Vehicle}}\n\n[[Category:Chevrolet trucks|S-10]]\n[[Category:Flexible-fuel vehicles]]\n[[Category:Pickup trucks]]\n[[Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:All-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:1980s cars]]\n[[Category:1990s cars]]\n[[Category:2000s cars]]\n[[Category:Cars of Brazil]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1981]]\n[[Category:Motor vehicles manufactured in the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=May 2010}}\n\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name=Chevrolet S-10<br>GMC S-15/Sonoma\n|image=98-04 Chevrolet S-10.jpg\n|manufacturer=[[General Motors]]\n|production=1981\u20132004 (North America)<br>1995\u2013present (Brazil)\n|layout=[[Front-engine design|Front engine]], [[rear-wheel drive]] / [[four-wheel drive]]\n|predecessor=[[Isuzu Faster#first|Chevrolet LUV]]\n|successor=[[Chevrolet Colorado|Chevrolet Colorado / GMC Canyon]] (North America only)\n|class=Compact [[pickup truck]]\n}}\n\nThe '''Chevrolet S-10''' is a [[Pickup truck|compact pickup truck]] that was produced by [[Chevrolet]]. It was the first domestically built compact pickup of the big three American automakers. When it was first introduced as a  \"quarter-ton pickup\" in 1981 for the 1982 model year, the [[GMC (General Motors division)|GMC]] version was known as the '''S-15''' and later renamed the '''GMC Sonoma'''. A high-performance version was released in 1991 and given the name of [[GMC Syclone]]. The pickup was also sold by [[Isuzu]] as the '''Hombre''' from 1996 through 2000, but only in North America. There was also an [[SUV]] version, the [[Chevrolet S-10 Blazer|Chevrolet S-10 Blazer/GMC S-15 Jimmy]]. An [[Chevrolet S-10 EV|electric version]] was leased as a fleet vehicle in 1997 and 1998. Together, these pickups are often referred to as the '''S-series'''.\n\nIn North America, the S-series was replaced by the [[Chevrolet Colorado]], GMC Canyon, and [[Chevrolet Colorado#Isuzu i-series|Isuzu i-Series]] in 2004.\n\nThe S-Series ended production in Brazil in 2012, being replaced by the [[Chevrolet Colorado]], but still with the name S-10.\n\n{{TOC left}}\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==First generation (1982\u20131993)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = First generation\n| image = 1992 Chevrolet S-10 Tahoe.jpg\n| production = 1981&ndash;1993\n| model_years = 1982&ndash;1993\n| aka = {{unbulleted list|GMC S-15|GMC Sonoma}}\n| engine = {{unbulleted list |1.9 L ''[[List of Isuzu engines#LR1|LR1]]'' [[Straight-4|I4]] ([[gasoline]])|2.0 L ''[[General Motors 122 engine#LQ2|LQ2]]'' [[Straight-4|I4]] (gasoline)|2.2 L ''[[List of Isuzu engines#LQ7|LQ7]]'' [[Straight-4|I4]] ([[diesel fuel|diesel]])|2.5 L ''[[Iron Duke engine|L38]]'' [[Straight-4|I4]] (gasoline)|2.5 L ''[[Iron Duke engine|LN8]]'' [[Straight-4|I4]] (gasoline)|2.8 L ''[[General Motors 60\u00b0 V6 engine#LR2|LR2]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]] (gasoline)|2.8 L ''[[General Motors 60\u00b0 V6 engine#LL2|LL2]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]] (gasoline)|4.3 L ''[[General Motors 90\u00b0 V6 engine#L35 CPI|L35]]'' [[V6]] (gasoline)|4.3 L ''[[General Motors 90\u00b0 V6 engine#LB1 and LB4|LB4]]'' [[V6]] (gasoline)}}\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list |3-speed ''[[Turbo-Hydramatic#THM200|THM-200C]]'' automatic|4-speed [[Isuzu]] ''S101'' manual|4-speed [[Borg-Warner]] ''T4'' manual|4-speed  ''[[Turbo-Hydramatic#700R4 .2F 4L60 .2F 4L60E .2F 4L65E|700R4]]'' automatic|4-speed  ''[[Turbo-Hydramatic#700R4 .2F 4L60 .2F 4L60E .2F 4L65E|4L60]]'' automatic||4-speed  ''[[Turbo-Hydramatic#700R4 .2F 4L60 .2F 4L60E .2F 4L65E|4L60-E]]'' automatic|5-speed [[Getrag]] ''290'' manual|5-speed ''5LM60'' manual|5-speed ''[[New Venture Gear 3500 transmission|NV3500]]'' manual|5-speed [[Borg Warner]] ''[[Borg-Warner T-5 transmission|T5]]'' manual}}\n| assembly = United States: [[Moraine, Ohio]] ([[Moraine Assembly]])<br>[[Shreveport, Louisiana]] ([[Shreveport Operations|Shreveport Assembly]])<br>[[Pontiac, Michigan]]|Canada: [[Ingersoll, Ontario]] ([[CAMI Automotive]])<br>[[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]]\n| platform = [[GM GMT platform#GMT 325/330|GMT325]]\n| wheelbase = {{unbulleted list |{{convert|108.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (reg. cab short bed)|{{convert|117.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (reg. cab long bed)|{{convert|122.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (ext. cab short bed)}}\n| related = {{unbulleted list |[[Chevrolet S-10 Blazer|Chevrolet S-10 Blazer / GMC S15 Jimmy]]|[[GMC Syclone]]|[[GMC Typhoon]]|[[Oldsmobile Bravada]]|[[Grumman LLV]]}}\n}}\n\n[[File:1st GMC Sonoma -- 09-28-2011.jpg|thumb|left|1991\u20131994 GMC Sonoma ST extended cab]]\n[[File:1st-Chevrolet-S10.jpg|thumb|left|1982\u20131990 Chevrolet S-10 single cab]]\n[[File:GMC-Sonoma.jpg|thumb|left|1982\u20131990 GMC S-15 single cab]]\n\nThe first compact truck from the big three automakers was the rebadged [[Isuzu KB]] sold since 1972 as the [[Chevrolet LUV]], and Ford quickly responded with the [[Mazda B-Series#Second generation (1965\u20131977)|Mazda-built Ford Courier]] the same year. However, the 1973 Arab oil embargo forced GM to consider designing a domestically produced compact pickup truck.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} As usual, parts from other GM chassis lines (primarily from the [[GM G platform (RWD)|GM G-body]] [[mid-size car|intermediates]]) were incorporated. Track width was similar to the former [[GM H platform (RWD)|GM H-body]] [[subcompact]]s ([[Chevrolet Vega|Vega]]/[[Chevrolet Monza|Monza]]). The first S-series pickups were introduced in 1981 for the 1982 model year. The base engine (manufactured in Japan and imported) was a 1.9 L Isuzu four-cylinder (RPO LR1) shared with the LUV and Isuzu P'UP, with a 2.8 L V6 as an option. The Chevrolet and GMC models were identical apart from the grille, tailgate and assorted insignia. An extended cab and \"Insta-Trac\" four-wheel drive were added the next year along with two new engines - a 2.0 L four-cylinder engine (RPO LQ2) from the [[GM J platform|J-platform]] automobiles along with an Isuzu 2.2 L (RPO LQ7) four-cylinder diesel engine.\n\nThe sport utility [[Chevrolet S-10 Blazer|S-10 Blazer and S-15 Jimmy]] debuted for 1983; GM was the first to introduce the compact sport utility, followed by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and then [[Jeep]] in 1984. Following the popularity of the [[Jeep_Cherokee_(XJ)|Jeep Cherokee]], 4-door [[SUV]] variants were introduced in March 1990 as 1991 [[model year|models]] alongside the badge-engineered [[Oldsmobile Bravada]]. \n\nNew heavy-duty and off-road suspensions appeared in 1984 along with a hydraulic clutch, while the big news for 1985 was the discontinuation of the [[Chevrolet Cavalier|Cavalier]]'s 2.0 L OHV [[Straight-4|I4]] in favor of [[Pontiac]]'s 2.5 L \"Iron Duke\" OHV I4. The OHV-derived 2.2 L diesel engine and 1.9 [[Liter|L]] SOHC gas engine, both from Isuzu, were gone the next year, leaving just the Iron Duke and updated 2.8 L [[V6]]. A much-welcomed 4.3 L V6 was added for 1988, and [[anti-lock brakes]] came the next year.\n \nThe GMC S-15 became the GMC Sonoma in 1991, and the Sierra trim packages were dropped to avoid confusion with the new GMC Sierra [[full-size]] pickup. The GMC Syclone also appeared that year. The Sonoma GT bowed in 1992. Added to this was the 4.3 L V6 Vortec W-code engine. This generation's last year was 1993.\n\n===Appearance packages===\nThe S-10 Baja is an optional appearance package that was put on any four-wheel drive S-10 (regular-cab with short-box, regular-cab with long box and extended-cab with short box) from 1989 to 1991. The Baja was available in three colors: Midnight Black, Apple Red and Frost White. The Baja option also included: a roll bar with off-road lights, front tubular grille guard with fog lights, tubular rear bumper, an underbody shield package (transfer case shield, front differential shield, fuel tank shield, oil pan/steering linkage shields), a suspension package, Chevrolet windshield banner, Baja decals on the box sides and one inch wide body striping. Extra cost Baja options included a cargo-net end-gate, aluminum \"Outlaw\" wheels and a special box-mounted spare tire carrier with aluminum wheel. In 1991 the S10 Bajas came with special \"BAJA\" embroidered red and grey bucket seats and unique red door panel trim.\n\nThe S-10 Cameo and Cameo EL were appearance packages available for the two-wheel drive S-10 between 1989 and 1991. When first introduced in 1989, the Cameo had three color choices; Apple Red, Frost White or Midnight Black. In 1991, two-tone paint schemes were available, as well as additional exterior features such as a wraparound front bumper with fog lamps, lower body ground-effects moldings and wheel flares, a flush-fitting tailgate valance, rear roll pan (state laws permitting), and \"Cameo\" lettering on the doors and tailgate. Other appearance packages included the S-10 Back Country, predecessor to the Baja, the S-10 Top Gun edition, the GMC Sonoma SST, the GMC S-15 Gypsy Magic and GMC Jimmy Magic.\n\n===Sonoma GT===\n[https://www.hemmings.com/blog/2016/03/07/faster-than-a-corvette-gmcs-syclone-sport-truck-celebrates-a-quarter-century/|thumb|left|Syclone]\nThe '''Sonoma GT''' was a performance package available on the two-wheel drive regular cab short bed Sonoma.

Version (Second Facelift)]]\n\nThe second-generation trucks arrived for the 1994 model year. All of the special models (the Syclone, Typhoon, and Sonoma GT) were discontinued, but the changes to the pickup brought it in line with its major competitor the [[Ford Ranger]]. The Iron Duke 4-cylinder and 2.8&nbsp;L 60\u00b0 V6 engines were retired, the 4.3&nbsp;L Vortec V6 was enhanced, and a new 2.2&nbsp;L 4-cylinder engine (which had been introduced in 1990 on various front-wheel drive GM compact and mid-size platforms) became the engines of choice to power the second generation of S-10s. In compliance with the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], all second generation S-10s and Sonomas equipped with air conditioning used CFC-free R134a refrigerant beginning in the 1994 model year. The all new 1994 S-10 didn't offer any airbag, presumably as a temporary measure to economize the introduction of the new body styles, as well as to gradually phase out steering wheel designs that didn't accommodate for airbags, though the vehicle itself was slated for airbag capability.\n\nMany of the chassis components were the same as the first generation (the A-frames between the first and second generation were the same although they were originally sourced from GM's [[GM G platform (RWD)|G-body]] vehicle lineup), along with the steering knuckle, leaf springs, and differential assembly but suspension and axles were greatly enhanced. Lower A-frames for the two-wheel drive model had 1/4-inch thicker steering stops - the second generation A-frames are commonly used as an upgrade for the first generation. [[Sport utility vehicle|Sport utility]] models (Blazer, Jimmy, Bravada) came with thicker front and rear sway bars.\n\nGenerally, for the two-wheel drive trucks, the 8.5-inch rear end was only used when it came with both a [[manual transmission]] and the L35 W-code {{convert|262|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[V6 engine]]; it was an option for four-wheel drive trucks with either [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]]. This was also the year that GM introduced the [[RPO ZR2|ZR2 off-road package]].\n\nFor 1995, a driver's side air bag was added as well as daytime running lights. In 1996 the 4.3&nbsp;L engine was refreshed, and a third (rear) door was added for extended cab models, along with the sportside bed option. In 1998, the exterior, interior<ref>http://oldcarbrochures.org/November%202019/1998%20Chevrolet%20S-10%20Pickup/slides/1998%20Chevrolet%20S-10%20Pickup-00a-01.html</ref>, brakes, and 2.2&nbsp;L [[Straight-4|I4]] engine were refreshed, along with a \"next-generation\" supplemental restraint system that added a passenger-side air bag. The SS package was replaced by the \"Xtreme\" package. In 2001, a crew cab option was added and was only available with four-wheel drive and an [[automatic transmission]]. For the 2004 model year, the regular and extended cab models were discontinued; only the crew cab model was retained.\n\nBase two-wheel drive models came with 15 x 6.5-inch wheels with directional vents, Xtreme and [[ZQ8]] models came with 16 x 8-inch wheels while four-wheel drive models (including the [[RPO ZR2|ZR2]]) used 15 x 7-inch wheels.  The {{convert|14|in|mm|adj=on}} wheels used on the first generation were discontinued.\n\n===SS===\nThe Chevrolet S-10 SS was a high-performance version of the S-10, introduced in 1994.  Fewer than 3,000 SSs were produced yearly on average.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} When introduced, the SS was only sold in three colors: Onyx Black, Summit White, and Apple Red.  The SS was discontinued in 1998 and was replaced by the S-10 Xtreme for the 1999 model year.\n\nA 4.3 L V6 (which was optional on regular S-10s) was the standard engine used in the SS, producing between 180 and {{Convert|200|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The SS included a limited slip differential, lowered suspension (starting with the 1996 model year), cosmetic changes such as a different grille, body-colored bumpers, 16-inch wheels (available from 1996 to 1998, similar in design to the 1991 and 1992 Camaro Z28 with Chevrolet \"bowtie\" logo center caps), and other minor cosmetic differences.  All SS versions were regular cabs, Xtremes were available with the \"third door\" extended cab. A step-side version was available from 1996 to 1998 and until 2003 on the Xtreme.\n\n[[File:2001 Chevrolet S-10 ZR2.JPG|thumb|2001 Chevrolet S-10 ZR2]]\n[[File:Green sonoma.jpg|thumb|1994\u20131997 GMC Sonoma regular cab]]\n\n===ZR2===\nThe ZR2 package was an off-road package available for the second generation S-10.  The ZR2 package included a {{Convert|4|in|mm|adj=on}} wider track width, a boxed ladder-type frame with modified suspension mounting points, larger wheel and axle bearings, 31-inch all-terrain tires, a suspension lift (approximately 3&nbsp;inches more ground clearance versus a regular four-wheel drive S-10), upgraded Bilstein suspension, fender flares, alloy wheels, and an 8.5-inch Chevrolet 10-bolt rear differential with 3.73:1 gears and an Eaton MLocker (coded as G80). {{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n===Isuzu Hombre===\n[[File:96-97 Isuzu Hombre 2.jpg|200px|thumb|left|1996\u20131997 Isuzu Hombre single cab]]\n\nIn 1996, [[Isuzu]] replaced its [[Isuzu Faster|P'up]] with a version of the Louisiana-built Chevrolet S-10, the '''Isuzu Hombre''', based on the Brazilian market S-10 (the front grille and fenders are based on the Brazilian S-10 along with the truck bed sheetmetal). The Hombre differed from its GM siblings mostly in the front sheetmetal, with different lights, grille, front bumper and front fenders, which were more flared out. The rear quarter panels were also different, as they had a slight flare over the wheel well to match the front fenders. The Hombre had a much smaller range of equipment options compared to the S-10 and Sonoma; a''Spacecab'' extended cab, V6 engine and four-wheel drive were added for 1997 and available until 1998.\n\nTwo trim levels were offered: the base S and the uplevel XS. The XS had features like a cassette tape deck, higher-grade interior fabric, a tachometer, sliding rear window, and a split 60/40 seatback. Hombres were equipped with the Chevrolet S-series 15 x 7 steel wheels (with 8 directional vents) - the Hombre wheels were painted black (the S10, Sonoma, and Blazer/Jimmy wheels were painted silver) since a majority were equipped with wheel covers with the Isuzu logo. Hombres were also available with the S-10's aluminum wheels with Isuzu center caps.\n\nSlow sales resulted in production ending in 2000. It would be another six years before Isuzu re-entered the pick-up market with the [[Chevrolet Colorado#Isuzu i series|i-Series]], which formed the basis for the S-10's successor, the [[Chevrolet Colorado|Colorado]].\n{{clear}}\n\n===Engines===\n<ref>{{cite book|title=Chevrolet S-10 Product Brochures|year=1994\u20132004}}</ref>\n{| class=wikitable\n!Years\n!Engine\n!Power\n!Torque\n!VIN letter\n|-\n|1994\u20132000, 2003||2.2 L ''[[GM 122 engine#LN2|Vortec 2200 (LN2)]]'' [[Straight-4|I4]]||{{Convert|110-120|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 5200 RPM||{{convert|130|-|140|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 2800 RPM||4\n|-\n|2000-2002||2.2 L ''[[GM 122 engine#L43|Vortec 2200 (L43)]]'' [[Straight-4|I4]]||{{Convert|120|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 5000 RPM||{{convert|140|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 3600 RPM||5\n|-\n|1994||rowspan=2|4.3 L ''[[Chevrolet 90-Degree V6 engine#LB4|90\u00b0 (LB4)]]'' [[V-6 engine|V-6]], [[Fuel injection#Throttle body injection|TBI]]||{{Convert|165|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 4000 RPM|| rowspan=\"2\" |{{convert|235|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 2400 RPM||rowspan=2|Z\n|-\n|1995||{{Convert|155|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 4000 RPM\n|-\n|1994|| rowspan=4|4.3 L ''[[Chevrolet 90-degree V6 engine#L35|Vortec 4300 (L35)]]'' [[V-6 engine|V-6]], [[Fuel injection#Central port injection|SCPI]]||{{convert|200|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 4500 rpm||{{convert|260|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 3600 rpm|| rowspan=\"4\" |W\n|-\n|1995||{{convert|190|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 4500 rpm||{{convert|260|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 3400 rpm\n|-\n|1996-2002 w/ 2WD||{{Convert|180|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 4400 RPM||{{convert|245|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 2800 RPM\n|-\n|1996-2002 w/ 4WD||{{Convert|190|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 4400 RPM||{{convert|250|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 2800 RPM\n|-\n|1996-1999 w/ 2WD||rowspan=2|4.3 L ''[[Chevrolet 90-degree V6 engine#LF6|Vortec 4300 (LF6)]]'' [[V-6 engine|V-6]], [[Fuel injection#Multi port fuel injection|MPFI]]||{{Convert|175|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 4400 RPM|| rowspan=\"2\" |{{convert|240|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 2800 RPM||rowspan=2|X<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://service.gm.com/dealerworld/vincards/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-08-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161125081638/https://service.gm.com/dealerworld/vincards/ |archive-date=2016-11-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n|-\n|1996-1999 w/ 4WD||{{Convert|180|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 4400 RPM\n|-\n|2003 w/ 2WD||rowspan=2|4.3 L ''[[Chevrolet 90-degree V6 engine#LU3|Vortec 4300 (LU3)]]'' [[V-6 engine|V-6]], [[Fuel injection#Multiport fuel injection|MPFI]]||{{Convert|180|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 4400 RPM||{{convert|245|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 2800 RPM||rowspan=2|X\n|-\n|2003-2004 w/ 4WD||{{Convert|190-200|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 5400 RPM||{{convert|260|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 2800 RPM\n|}\n\n==Third generation (2012\u2013present)==\n{{see also|Chevrolet Colorado#Second generation}}\n{{Infobox automobile\n|image=Brazilian 2012 All-New Chevy S10.jpg\n|name=Third generation\n|production=2012\u2013present\n|aka=[[GMC Canyon]] <br>Isuzu I Series<br>[[Chevrolet Colorado]](North America)<br>[[Holden Colorado]] (Australia)<br> HSV SportsCat (Australia) <br> [[Isuzu D-Max]]\n}}\n[[File:Patrullero_de_Rosario,_Santa_Fe.jpg|thumb|left|facelift]]\nAlthough the North American version of the S-series was discontinued in 2004, the second generation S-10 was still being built in Brazil until 2012, when it was replaced by a Brazilian-built version of the [[Chevrolet Colorado]] called the S-10.\n\nIn Brazil, until 2014, the third generation S-10 offered a 2.4 L 147&nbsp;hp ''[[Family II engine|Flexpower]]'' [[flex-fuel]] engine or a 2.8 L 180&nbsp;hp ''[[List of VM Motori engines#A 428 DOHC|Duramax]]'' diesel engine. For 2015 models, the diesel engine was refreshed, resulting in an increased power output of 200&nbsp;hp. The flex-fuel (gasoline/ethanol) engine had an upgrade for some versions (LT and LTZ) and offered 206&nbsp;hp with a 2.5 L [[GM Ecotec engine#LCV|LCV Ecotec]] with [[direct fuel injection]]. Also, for the first time in Brazil, Chevrolet offered the [[Flexible-fuel vehicle|flex-fuel]] S-10 with four-wheel drive.\n\nFor the 2017 model, the S-10 received a facelift and the flex-fuel 2.4 L engine was dropped, with the remaining engine choices being unchanged.

This was Ford Australia's top-of-the-range model until replaced by an Australian-assembled version of the full-sized American [[Ford Galaxie]]. In 1967, Ford Australia reintroduced the Fairlane, this time as an Australian-developed, luxury, long-wheelbase version of its mainstream [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Falcon]], positioned between the Falcon and the Galaxie. The locally assembled Galaxie evolved into the [[Ford LTD (North America)|LTD]] which was itself replaced in 1973 by an Australian-developed, Fairlane-based model, also known as the Ford LTD. In North America, unlike its designation in Australia, it was not considered a luxury vehicle. In Australia, \"LTD\" originally stood for \"Lincoln Type Design\", although Ford Australia later promoted a connection with the meaning \"Limited\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aus-ford-uk.co.uk/html/ltd.html|title=Australian Ford Register \u2013 Ford LTD|access-date=15 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gumtree.com.au/ford-ltd.html|title=Australian Ford LTD Review and Specs|access-date=15 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Fairlane and LTD competed in the marketplace with the [[Holden Brougham]] (1968\u20131971), the [[Statesman (automobile)|Statesman]] (1971\u20131984), and later with the [[Holden Caprice|Holden Statesman and Caprice]] (1990\u20132007).\n\nFord produced the Fairlane/LTD at [[Campbellfield, Victoria]], and [[Eagle Farm, Queensland]], in the early years. Until around March/April 1978 with the upcoming release of the [[Ford Falcon (XD)]] and its derivatives, Ford consolidated Falcon production at Campbellfield and Fairlane/LTD manufacturing to Eagle Farm. Around the release of the next generation during the [[Ford Falcon (EA)|EA Falcon]] era (1988), Eagle Farm ceased manufacture of cars and only produced heavy trucks until its closure in 1998.\n\n== Australian-assembled US Fairlanes ==\n===Full-size Fairlane (1959\u20131962)===\n[[File:1959 Fairlane 500==.JPG|thumb|1960\u20131961 Ford Fairlane 500 sedan (facelift)]]\n\nIn September 1959, [[Ford Australia]] released three new locally assembled models, the [[1957 Ford|Fairlane 500]], the lower specification [[Ford Custom 300|Custom 300]], and the [[Ford Ranch Wagon|Ranch Wagon]].<ref name=RestoredCars>The Australian 1959\u201360 Ford Fairlane, Restored Cars magazine No 84, July 1990, pages 4\u20136</ref> They were sourced from [[Ford of Canada]],<ref>[http://uniquecars.carpoint.ninemsn.com.au/portal/alias__uniquecarsau/tabID__203009/ArticleID__4222/DesktopDefault.aspx 1959 Ford Fairlane at uniquecars.carpoint.ninemsn.com.au] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329111548/http://uniquecars.carpoint.ninemsn.com.au/portal/alias__uniquecarsau/tabID__203009/ArticleID__4222/DesktopDefault.aspx |date=2010-03-29 }}.

The ZF Fairlanes were joined by an even more upscale LTD in August 1973, with hidden headlamps and vinyl roof. Model names remained the same (Custom and 500), as did the engine choices, as the previous model year. Although this car was designed and built exclusively in Australia, its styling is reminiscent of the US-market [[Mercury Montego]]. The 1973 ZF also had the last manual transmission; afterwards, all Fairlanes were automatics.\n\nThis model was also sold in South Africa, unlike the Falcon, which was discontinued in favour of the European [[Ford Granada (Europe)|Granada]]. Only the Fairlane 500, with column shift and seating for six, was available in South Africa.

The changes were mainly cosmetic, with a four-horizontal-bar grille and revised taillight lenses and garnish panel. An anniversary model with a standard 302 was released in 1975, but otherwise the range stayed the same as the 1974 versions.\nThe Fairlane-based P5 series Ford LTD was released very late in the ZF model run in August 1973, three months prior to the ZG Fairlane. The LTD was only available as a four-door sedan, and the wheelbase was even longer than that of the Fairlane, itself a stretched Falcon. A luxury two-door coup\u00e9 called the [[Ford Landau (Australia)|Ford Landau]] (also designated P5) was released at the same time. The Landau was based on the Australian Falcon Hardtop, so featured a {{convert|111|in|mm|adj=mid}} wheelbase as opposed to the {{convert|121|in|mm|adj=mid}} wheelbase of the LTD. Both models were notable for their [[hidden headlights|concealed headlamps]], which were revealed when their vacuum-operated [[grille]] sections were retracted. The technology was similar to that found on earlier models of the American built [[Ford Thunderbird]]. Standard equipment on both the LTD and the Landau included integrated air conditioning, automatic transmission, electric windows, and a 351ci / 5.8L V8 engine.\n\nAlso in July 1975, Ford commenced a release of the Town Cars. These were 50th-Anniversary models, celebrating 50 years of Ford in Australia. They produced 250 of each in the LTD and Fairlane ranges. The Fairlanes in particular were optioned with LTD components, 15-inch wheels, leather interior, and electric windows to name some options. In the Fairlane, only a small handful was special-ordered with a 351 motor. All others were 302s. The LTD were 351-engine cars.\n\n[https://www.flickr.com/photos/23725628@N06/4626374317/in/photostream 50th Anniversary Model badge]\n\nAs the P5 was released during the ZF model run, it retained many ZF components. For example, the main interior upgrade from the Fairlane ZF to ZG was the turn signal stalk. The ZF had the older-style stalk with the high beam \"dipper\" switch on the floor. When the ZG Fairlane was released a big item was the new multifunction column stalk which incorporated the dipper switch and horn. The P5s, however, used the ZF-style stalk and still had a \"squeeze rim\" horn similar to Falcon GTs of the era.  Because the P6 LTD was not released until about five months after the ZH Fairlane, some of the last P5s actually had a few minor ZH parts fitted.\n{{clear}}\n\n==== ZH / P6 (1976\u20131979) ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right | direction = horizontal | width = 200\n| image1 = Ford Fairlane ZH 500 (23531054516).jpg\n| image2 = Ford Fairlane ZH 500 (22930040893).jpg\n| footer =  1976\u201379 Ford Fairlane (ZH) 500\n}}\n\nThe ZH series addressed earlier complaints about the Fairlane being too close to the Falcon in May 1976. The designers retained the same central section from the upcoming XC [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Falcon]] (including that car's new rear doors), but put on lengthened front and rear ends, giving the car more bulk and a luxury impression. The styling was reminiscent of the 1968 [[Mercury Marquis]]. The range-topping LTD went further upmarket with a fancy, [[Rolls-Royce car|Rolls-Royce]]-inspired grille (not dissimilar to that found on the [[Lincoln Continental Mark V|Continental Mark V]]. Another sign of the upmarket move was the 500 becoming the basic trim (the Custom was deleted), and the Fairlane Marquis being the upscale version. The Marquis was Ford's response to the [[Statesman (automobile)|Statesman Caprice]], which was introduced in 1974 as an LTD rival. ZH also moved to the use of the metric system to denote the engine sizes: the basic engine was known as the 4.9&nbsp;L, the other as the 5.8&nbsp;L. All ZH Marquises built after January 1979 had Borg-Warner differentials instead of the Ford 9-inch.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = 200\n| image1 = Ford LTD (P6).jpg\n| image2 = 1978 Ford LTD (P6) sedan (23611729281).jpg\n| footer =  1976\u20131979 Ford LTD (P6)\n}}\n\nThe P6 Series LTD was introduced in September 1976.<ref>[http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/ford_LTD_FB_technical_specifications.htm Ford LTD FB/P6 Technical Specifications].

This model was a leap ahead into the new decade, with squared-off lines and a six-light bodyshell clearly distinguishing Fairlane from the new XD Falcon of that year. The traditional quad headlights and distinctive vertically striped taillights further differentiated the luxury model from Falcon. The trim levels were deleted:  now, only a single Fairlane was available, with {{convert|302|cuin|L|1|order=flip|adj=mid}} or {{convert|351|cuin|L|1|order=flip|adj=mid}} V8 engine choices. In October, recognising the fuel crisis, Ford introduced a Fairlane with a {{convert|250|cuin|L|1|order=flip|adj=mid}} inline-six from the Falcon.\n\nThe LTD version of the ZJ surfaced in October 1979 as the FC Series, using the same wheelbase and body panels as the Fairlane. In mid-1980, the Falcon 4.1-litre alloy head engine was made optional, the first time the LTD was available in six-cylinder guise.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"120px\">\nFile:1982 Ford LTD (FC) sedan (2015-05-29) 01.jpg|Ford LTD (FC)\nFile:1982 Ford LTD (FC) sedan (2015-05-29) 03.jpg|Ford LTD (FC)\nFile:1981 Ford FC LTD Cartier (6058256901).jpg|Ford LTD (FC) Cartier\n</gallery>\n\n==== {{anchor|ZK|FD}} ZK / FD (1982\u20131984) ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = 200\n| image1 = 1982-1984 Ford Fairlane (ZK) sedan (2012-01-15) 01.jpg\n| image2 = 1982-1984 Ford Fairlane (ZK) sedan (2012-01-15) 02.jpg\n| footer = 1982\u20131984 Ford Fairlane (ZK)\n}}\n\nThe ZK series of March 1982 had the deletion of the 5.8-L V8, which was the first warning the company would soon drop [[V8 engine|V8s]] from the local line-up. Minor changes were made to grille and taillights, but otherwise the external changes were negligible. In March 1983, the 4.9-L V8 was deleted, too, with Ford introducing a [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]] version of the six to take its place, claiming the new engine had  acceleration figures equivalent to the V8.\n\nThe main notable mechanical change was the introduction of the coil sprung, watts link-located rear axle, one of the best live rear-axle configurations.\n\nThe LTD FC series was updated to and designated FD in March 1982 with the V8 engine option deleted the following year.\n{{clear}}\n\n==== {{anchor|ZL|FE}} ZL / FE (1984\u20131988) ====\n[[File:1984-1986 Ford ZL Fairlane sedan (2011-01-05) 02.jpg|thumb|Ford Fairlane (ZL)]]\n\nThe revised ZL series of 1985 (launched October 1984) kept the two six-cylinder engine options; only at the end of 1986 was the carburettor version of the Fairlane deleted. The ZL again carried over all external panels, but now had integrated headlights with clear indicators, full wrap-around bumpers, and new taillights. Inside, a full digital dashboard was introduced with push-button controls at either end of the instrument binnacle.

The philosophy was the same - a long-wheelbase Falcon with a six-light body. The 4.1-L six was heavily revised, becoming a 3.9-L unit with improved fuel economy and power. These models were part of the EA26 development programme and platform (E for the market segment, A for Australia, 26 the project code). Therefore, officially they were EA26s, but colloquially, Ford aficionados prefer a two-letter code. Hence, the new Fairlanes were given the NA series code.\n\nThe equivalent LTDs came on stream as the DA series in June 1988. Like the previous generation, all N-series Fairlanes and D-series LTDs were built on the Falcon/Fairmont station-wagon platform, and this legacy is most noticeable in the disproportionally narrow station-wagon rear doors on what was meant to be a limousine and in a car that otherwise caters well for rear-seat passengers with a large amount of interior seating and legroom space. Nonetheless, these large sedans were \"limousine enough\" to be one of the most common platforms used by Australian body-building companies to make stretch limousines.\n\nRevisions from November 1989 for the 1990 model year had the release of the NA II and DAII, the most notable change being the fitting of a four-speed, rather than three-speed, automatic transmission (since the Fairlane's debut, it had a three-speed).\n\nAlthough Ford Australia's former official historian, the late Adrian Ryan, was emphatic, officially, an NB series Fairlane never existed, at least one early 1989 prototype fitted with a four-speed automatic escaped from the factory bearing a compliance plate marked \"NB\" and was registered as an \"NB Fairlane\". Ford also produced an alloy wheel identification-guide poster for its parts counters listing one wheel as being for an \"NB Sportsman Fairlane\" and at one point the Series II NA likely was going to be called the NB. Third-party parts suppliers also often list both an \"NB Fairlane\" an \"NB \u2013 Series II Fairlane\" in their parts catalogues adding to the NB mystery. DOTARS (the Commonwealth Department of Transport and Regional Services) has no record of giving Ford approval to use an \"NB Fairlane\" compliance plate for a production model which might explain Ford's reluctance to officially acknowledge the \"NB\". {{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}{{original research inline|date=April 2012}}\n\n==== NC / DC (1991\u20131995) ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right | direction = horizontal | width = 200\n| image1 = 1994 Ford Fairlane (NC II) Ghia sedan (2011-11-30) 01.jpg\n| image2 = 1994 Ford Fairlane (NC II) Ghia sedan (2011-11-30) 02.jpg\n| footer = 1993 Ford Fairlane (NC II) Ghia sedan\n}}\n\n[[File:1994 Ford LTD (DC II) sedan (2015-07-03) 01.jpg|thumb|right|1994 Ford LTD (DC II)]]\n\nAugust 1991 had the news that many Fairlane/LTD purists had awaited: the reintroduction of the V8 in the NC Fairlane and DC-series LTD. Ford had never recovered from deleting the V8s in the 1980s and bowed to public pressure with its reintroduction. The 5.0-L engine was not identical to the one used in the United States Mustang and other passenger cars. For reason of better durability and perhaps cost, it was the Canadian-made Windsor engine used in the North American light truck and 4WD models. To meet the needs of the space required for a right-drive steering column, its inlet manifold was reversed. Again to meet the conversion to right-hand drive and the rerouted inlet ducting, air box, and air conditioning lines, the Australian-installed engines also had most of their serpentine belt-driven accessories on opposite side to the US/North American models. As Australian enthusiasts often found to their frustration, these subtle changes often meant that many Ford Racing/SVO add-on bits, like the available superchargers, were not exactly the bolt-on items they were in North America. The inline six continued. The NC also introduced a higher-spec Fairlane, called the Fairlane Ghia, and the V8 was available in this model.\n\nThe 1992 NC II and DC IIs redesignated the 3.9-L engine a \"4.0-litre\", but trim levels remained the same. To appeal to younger buyers, Ford briefly sold a Fairlane Sportsman Ghia in 1993 with a \"Tickford\"-tuned 4.0-L six used in the Falcon XR6.\nA second, even smaller update, known as the NC III, arrived in August 1993. It is the equivalent to the ED series Falcon, adopting the new \"ozone safe\" R134a air conditioning refrigerant. The base Fairlane model was also discontinued, leaving only the Fairlane Ghia.\n\nFrom March 1994 production, the NC received additional changes - the fitment of a leather-wrapped steering wheel, body-coloured bumpers and side protection strips, new-design alloy wheels, and a [[hood ornament|bonnet ornament]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://fordfalconfacts.com/model-specs/fairlane-ltd/nc-fairlane-dc-ltd-1991-1995/ | title = NC Fairlane / DC LTD | publisher = Falcon Facts | accessdate = 14 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nAn idea proposed in the late 1980s was a Fairlane wagon. Most likely, had it entered production, it would have used the Falcon wagon (which rode on the Fairlane's wheelbase) body, coupled with the Fairlane's front clip.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}{{original research inline|date=November 2009}}\n\nIn the early 1990s, the Falcon utilities were still of the previous-generation XF. A prototype EB Falcon utility was made which looked Fairlane-based. To impart a look of solidness, the ute had a Fairlane frontal treatment. It did not enter production.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==== NF / DF (1995\u20131996) ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right | direction = horizontal\n| image1 = Ford Fairlane Ghia (4).jpg | width1 = 180\n| image2 = 1995-1996 Ford LTD (DF) sedan (2011-03-23).jpg  | width2 = 242\n| footer = Ford Fairlane Ghia (NF; left) and Ford LTD (DF; right)\n}}\n\nThe Fairlane and LTD received a major front and rear restyle in March 1995 (EA77 series in Ford-speak), coinciding with the EF Falcon, and remained on the same platform. The new NF Fairlanes and DF LTDs were longer and curvier, hiding their 1980s origins reasonably well. The exterior design was more ornamental compared to the relatively clean NAs to NCs. The Fairlane Sportsman reappeared for 1996, with the same formula as 1993, with the 4.0-L six.{{Clear}}\n\n==== NL / DL (1996\u20131999) ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right | direction = horizontal | width = 200\n| image1 = 1998 Ford Fairlane (NL) Ghia sedan (24141149516).jpg\n| image2 = 1998 Ford Fairlane (NL) Ghia sedan (24059154062).jpg\n| footer =  Ford Fairlane (NL) Ghia\n}}\n\n[[File:1997 Ford LTD (DL) sedan (2015-07-03) 01.jpg|thumb|right|Ford LTD (DL)]]\nIn September 1996, the revised NL Fairlanes and DL LTDs appeared. In 1997, Ford introduced a higher Fairlane Concorde trim, with the same 4.0- and 5.0-L engine choices. No Sportsman variant of the Fairlane was offered.\n\nFor customers, five Dealer modified NL Series Fairlanes from Sydney and Melbourne utilised parts from the 5.0-litre [[Mustang Cobra]] and Australian delivered [[Special Vehicle Operations|SVO]] parts due to the limited edition run of the Fairlane by Tickford and customers wanting to maintain the Luxury look but sport the GT's performance.  The rounded body lines were reminiscent of the US-market Ford Taurus, while the front end styling was similar to the Lincoln Town Car.\n\nFord expanded the Fairlane range greatly in 1998. Beginning with the Ghia, also a basic Concorde (six-cylinder) and Concorde Ghia (V8) were offered. A [[Tickford Vehicle Engineering|Tickford]]-modified version was also available, with the larger engine, as well as a luxurious Fairlane Special Edition Ghia.\n\nThe NL and DL series were the last models to come equipped with automatic self-leveling rear suspension.\n{{clear}}\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/z8ulok3bqmesxrz/20200409_102715.jpg?dl=0] \n\nThe New Zealand Government also used the NL Fairlane Ghia as their designated Crown Limousines. All Crown Fairlanes were mostly painted Amaretto (a few in white) and were fitted with silver chonchorde 16 inch wheels, 6 disc cd stacker electric adjust drivers seat and New Zealand fitted flag pole mounts on the front guards. \n\nAll of the Fairlane Ghias used by the New Zealand Government were fitted with the factory 4.0L six cylinder engine producing 165kw. The LTD was also used with only a few being V8 models. The LTD Crown Cars were a range of colours including Dynamic White, Argon Silver and Mocha Foam. The NL and DL Crown cars all sported special government licence plates starting with CR404 and continuing in numerical order to CR437. Most crown cars were retired after 3 years of service. The Fairlane and LTD had been used by the New Zealand Government since the 1970s through to 2010s where the Ford brand was replaced with BMW 7 series. \n\nThe New Zealand Government still uses CR registration plates on their current Crown Cars.\n\nPlease note, pre-facelift NF and DF Fairlanes were also used by the New Zealand Government.\n\n=== Fifth generation ===\n==== AU (1999\u20132003) ====\n[[File:2001 Ford Fairlane (AU II) Ghia sedan (2015-07-24) 01.jpg|thumb|Ford Fairlane (AU II) Ghia]]\n{{multiple image\n| align = right | direction = horizontal | width = 200\n| image1 = 2002 Ford LTD (AU II) sedan (2010-07-05) 01.jpg\n| image2 = 2002 Ford LTD (AU II) sedan (2010-07-05) 02.jpg\n| footer = 2000\u20132003 Ford LTD (AU II)\n}}\n\nFord introduced its \"[[New Edge]]\" look to the AU series Fairlane in February 1999, with some success, though the EA169 platform was considered a flop, allowing rival [[Holden]] to overtake the company in the sales of full-sized cars. The AU LTD was released 3 months later in May.\n\nThe AU Fairlane and LTD models were the first long-wheelbase sedans to share a model code with the Falcon. They had [[Lincoln Town Car]] styling cues, especially around the [[C-pillar]]. The range was pared back to just two models, the Fairlane Ghia and the LTD, although a limited-edition Fairlane Millennium Ghia was also offered in January 2000.<ref>[http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/carfamilytree?ReadForm&ID=D62DD4AB47EC387FCA257125001A1418 Ford AU Fairlane].

The BA Fairlanes and LTDs were closer to the Falcon in looks, even sharing the taillights. The 5.0-L gave way to the larger 5.4-L [[Ford Modular engine#5.4 L|Modular]] V8, already used in the US From this point the LTD was no longer offered with a six-cylinder engine.\n\nTo capture younger buyers, the Fairlane G220 (denoting its {{convert|220|kW|hp|adj=mid}} power output at 4,750&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|472|Nm|lbft}} of torque from 3,250\u20134,000&nbsp;rpm) took the place of the Fairlane Sportsman, and featured the larger engine only. The traditional automatic gearbox was replaced by a [[tiptronic|sequential automatic]]. Unique to the G220 were 17-inch Elegance alloy wheels, ebony headlight bezels with unique lens, and redline leather seats with warm charcoal, perforated leather inserts.\n\nThe Fairlane Ghia continued as the six-cylinder base model, but came standard with colour ICC screen, asix-CD stack, 11-speaker Premium Sound, 7-way adjustable leather seats, and woodgrain inserts.\n\nThe LTD was further distinguished from the Ghia by having the 5.4-L V8 engine, sunroof, 17-inch alloy wheels, LTD badging, 10-way adjustable front seats, bolstered rear seats, [[satellite navigation]], and auto-dimming rear-vision mirror.<ref>{{cite web |last=Torr |first=Feann |year=2003 |url=http://www.webwombat.com.au/motoring/news_reports/xfd_fairlane.htm |title=First Drive: BA Ford Fairlane |publisher=Web Wombat |access-date=20 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nBrakes were the same as on the Falcon, with Fairlanes coming standard with [[electronic brakeforce distribution]] and [[traction control]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mynrma.com.au/motoring-services/reviews/car-reviews/ford/fairlane-ghia-ba-g220-ltd.htm |title=Ford Fairlane Ghia BA G220 & LTD Car Review |publisher=[[NRMA]] |date=1 March 2004 |access-date=20 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nFollowing Ford Australia's introduction of the BA II Falcon in October 2004, facelifted versions of the Fairlane Ghia, Fairlane G220, and LTD were introduced in March 2005. The changes were mainly cosmetic, but nevertheless significant, and were carried over in the subsequent BF model ranges. The facelifted Fairlane was headlined by a more heavily chromed exterior, including chrome rub strips, a new chromed rear appliqu\u00e9,  and on Fairlane Ghia and LTD, chromed wing mirror covers. The G220 was given new-design seven-spoke alloy wheels, while Fairlane Ghia and LTD added two-toned paint to their side skirts and lower valances.\n\nFor the BA II interior, the black leather seats and leather section of the door trims were replaced with new leather trim dubbed China Beige. The Ghia and G220 gained an eight-way power driver\u2019s seat with memory function. The G220 was given a leather-wrapped sports steering wheel, and the Ghia a Rhui Maple woodgrain and leather steering wheel, and the LTD gained a Stone Maple woodgrain and leather steering wheel.\n\nWhile the only BA II mechanical change was the addition of Sports Control Blade rear-suspension tune for the base Ghia and top-shelf LTD, a DVD rear entertainment system became standard for the LTD, exchangeable for a sunroof.\n\nAn interior upgrade that would be carried over in its entirety to the subsequent BF range was the change from black to brushed silver instrument dials and dash clock, and the silver shifter surround, centre cup holder, and ICC fascia became \"piano black\" with the ICC buttons changed accordingly from black to silver. Chrome door handles, vent tips, and door lock barrels were also added.<ref>{{cite web |last=Pettendy |first=Marton |date=4 February 2005 |url=http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/F5855C5E817D447CCA256F9D007C8CFA |title=Comfort is king in Ford's fresh Fairlane |work=GoAuto |access-date=20 August 2016}}</ref> The original woodgrain trim was retained until the BF.\n\n==== BF (2005\u20132007) ====\n[[File:2007 Ford Fairlane (BF) Ghia sedan (2015-07-24).jpg|thumb|2005\u20132007 Ford Fairlane (BF) Ghia]]\n{{multiple image | align = right | direction = horizontal\n| image1 = 2006 Ford LTD (BF) sedan (2015-07-24) 01.jpg\n| image2 = 2006 Ford LTD (BF) sedan (2015-07-24) 02.jpg \n| footer = 2005\u20132007 Ford LTD (BF)\n}}\n\nThe BF series Fairlane and LTD models were introduced in October 2005, with the Fairlane G220 renamed the Fairlane G8. Externally, the BF was outwardly identical to the BA Mark II, but fine tunings to steering, suspension, soundproofing and undercarriage were made. Fuel economy was also improved. Across the whole BF range, the taillight lenses were slightly changed in appearance. The Ghia went from 16-inch to 17-inch alloy wheels as standard.\n\nInterior-wise, the only changes from the upgrades introduced in the BA Mark II were the replacement of the woodgrain inserts with \"satin chrome\" inserts. This colour scheme was the same for all BF Fairlane variants. The BF Ghia and LTD came with black leather seats or China beige leather seats with eight-way adjustable drivers seat and six-way adjustable passenger seat.\n\nThe G8 featured an eight-cylinder engine with improved exhaust system and an additional knock sensor, producing  {{convert|230|kW|hp}} at 5,350&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|500|Nm|lbft}} of torque at 3,500&nbsp;rpm.<ref>[http://www.privatefleet.com.au/buying-new-car/car-reviews/ford/ford-fairlane-review/ Ford Fairlane at www.privatefleet.com.au].

This was Ford Australia's top-of-the-range model until replaced by an Australian-assembled version of the full-sized American [[Ford Galaxie]]. In 1967, Ford Australia reintroduced the Fairlane, this time as an Australian-developed, luxury, long-wheelbase version of its mainstream [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Falcon]], positioned between the Falcon and the Galaxie. The locally assembled Galaxie evolved into the [[Ford LTD (North America)|LTD]] which was itself replaced in 1973 by an Australian-developed, Fairlane-based model, also known as the Ford LTD. In North America, unlike its designation in Australia, it was not considered a luxury vehicle. In Australia, \"LTD\" originally stood for \"Lincoln Type Design\", although Ford Australia later promoted a connection with the meaning \"Limited\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aus-ford-uk.co.uk/html/ltd.html|title=Australian Ford Register \u2013 Ford LTD|access-date=15 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gumtree.com.au/ford-ltd.html|title=Australian Ford LTD Review and Specs|access-date=15 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Fairlane and LTD competed in the marketplace with the [[Holden Brougham]] (1968\u20131971), the [[Statesman (automobile)|Statesman]] (1971\u20131984), and later with the [[Holden Caprice|Holden Statesman and Caprice]] (1990\u20132007).\n\nFord produced the Fairlane/LTD at [[Campbellfield, Victoria]], and [[Eagle Farm, Queensland]], in the early years. Until around March/April 1978 with the upcoming release of the [[Ford Falcon (XD)]] and its derivatives, Ford consolidated Falcon production at Campbellfield and Fairlane/LTD manufacturing to Eagle Farm. Around the release of the next generation during the [[Ford Falcon (EA)|EA Falcon]] era (1988), Eagle Farm ceased manufacture of cars and only produced heavy trucks until its closure in 1998.\n\n== Australian-assembled US Fairlanes ==\n===Full-size Fairlane (1959\u20131962)===\n[[File:1959 Fairlane 500==.JPG|thumb|1960\u20131961 Ford Fairlane 500 sedan (facelift)]]\n\nIn September 1959, [[Ford Australia]] released three new locally assembled models, the [[1957 Ford|Fairlane 500]], the lower specification [[Ford Custom 300|Custom 300]], and the [[Ford Ranch Wagon|Ranch Wagon]].<ref name=RestoredCars>The Australian 1959\u201360 Ford Fairlane, Restored Cars magazine No 84, July 1990, pages 4\u20136</ref> They were sourced from [[Ford of Canada]],<ref>[http://uniquecars.carpoint.ninemsn.com.au/portal/alias__uniquecarsau/tabID__203009/ArticleID__4222/DesktopDefault.aspx 1959 Ford Fairlane at uniquecars.carpoint.ninemsn.com.au] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329111548/http://uniquecars.carpoint.ninemsn.com.au/portal/alias__uniquecarsau/tabID__203009/ArticleID__4222/DesktopDefault.aspx |date=2010-03-29 }}.

The ZF Fairlanes were joined by an even more upscale LTD in August 1973, with hidden headlamps and vinyl roof. Model names remained the same (Custom and 500), as did the engine choices, as the previous model year. Although this car was designed and built exclusively in Australia, its styling is reminiscent of the US-market [[Mercury Montego]]. The 1973 ZF also had the last manual transmission; afterwards, all Fairlanes were automatics.\n\nThis model was also sold in South Africa, unlike the Falcon, which was discontinued in favour of the European [[Ford Granada (Europe)|Granada]]. Only the Fairlane 500, with column shift and seating for six, was available in South Africa.

The changes were mainly cosmetic, with a four-horizontal-bar grille and revised taillight lenses and garnish panel. An anniversary model with a standard 302 was released in 1975, but otherwise the range stayed the same as the 1974 versions.\nThe Fairlane-based P5 series Ford LTD was released very late in the ZF model run in August 1973, three months prior to the ZG Fairlane. The LTD was only available as a four-door sedan, and the wheelbase was even longer than that of the Fairlane, itself a stretched Falcon. A luxury two-door coup\u00e9 called the [[Ford Landau (Australia)|Ford Landau]] (also designated P5) was released at the same time. The Landau was based on the Australian Falcon Hardtop, so featured a {{convert|111|in|mm|adj=mid}} wheelbase as opposed to the {{convert|121|in|mm|adj=mid}} wheelbase of the LTD. Both models were notable for their [[hidden headlights|concealed headlamps]], which were revealed when their vacuum-operated [[grille]] sections were retracted. The technology was similar to that found on earlier models of the American built [[Ford Thunderbird]]. Standard equipment on both the LTD and the Landau included integrated air conditioning, automatic transmission, electric windows, and a 351ci / 5.8L V8 engine.\n\nAlso in July 1975, Ford commenced a release of the Town Cars. These were 50th-Anniversary models, celebrating 50 years of Ford in Australia. They produced 250 of each in the LTD and Fairlane ranges. The Fairlanes in particular were optioned with LTD components, 15-inch wheels, leather interior, and electric windows to name some options. In the Fairlane, only a small handful was special-ordered with a 351 motor. All others were 302s. The LTD were 351-engine cars.\n\n[https://www.flickr.com/photos/23725628@N06/4626374317/in/photostream 50th Anniversary Model badge]\n\nAs the P5 was released during the ZF model run, it retained many ZF components. For example, the main interior upgrade from the Fairlane ZF to ZG was the turn signal stalk. The ZF had the older-style stalk with the high beam \"dipper\" switch on the floor. When the ZG Fairlane was released a big item was the new multifunction column stalk which incorporated the dipper switch and horn. The P5s, however, used the ZF-style stalk and still had a \"squeeze rim\" horn similar to Falcon GTs of the era.  Because the P6 LTD was not released until about five months after the ZH Fairlane, some of the last P5s actually had a few minor ZH parts fitted.\n{{clear}}\n\n==== ZH / P6 (1976\u20131979) ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right | direction = horizontal | width = 200\n| image1 = Ford Fairlane ZH 500 (23531054516).jpg\n| image2 = Ford Fairlane ZH 500 (22930040893).jpg\n| footer =  1976\u201379 Ford Fairlane (ZH) 500\n}}\n\nThe ZH series addressed earlier complaints about the Fairlane being too close to the Falcon in May 1976. The designers retained the same central section from the upcoming XC [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Falcon]] (including that car's new rear doors), but put on lengthened front and rear ends, giving the car more bulk and a luxury impression. The styling was reminiscent of the 1968 [[Mercury Marquis]]. The range-topping LTD went further upmarket with a fancy, [[Rolls-Royce car|Rolls-Royce]]-inspired grille (not dissimilar to that found on the [[Lincoln Continental Mark V|Continental Mark V]]. Another sign of the upmarket move was the 500 becoming the basic trim (the Custom was deleted), and the Fairlane Marquis being the upscale version. The Marquis was Ford's response to the [[Statesman (automobile)|Statesman Caprice]], which was introduced in 1974 as an LTD rival. ZH also moved to the use of the metric system to denote the engine sizes: the basic engine was known as the 4.9&nbsp;L, the other as the 5.8&nbsp;L. All ZH Marquises built after January 1979 had Borg-Warner differentials instead of the Ford 9-inch.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = 200\n| image1 = Ford LTD (P6).jpg\n| image2 = 1978 Ford LTD (P6) sedan (23611729281).jpg\n| footer =  1976\u20131979 Ford LTD (P6)\n}}\n\nThe P6 Series LTD was introduced in September 1976.<ref>[http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/ford_LTD_FB_technical_specifications.htm Ford LTD FB/P6 Technical Specifications].

This model was a leap ahead into the new decade, with squared-off lines and a six-light bodyshell clearly distinguishing Fairlane from the new XD Falcon of that year. The traditional quad headlights and distinctive vertically striped taillights further differentiated the luxury model from Falcon. The trim levels were deleted:  now, only a single Fairlane was available, with {{convert|302|cuin|L|1|order=flip|adj=mid}} or {{convert|351|cuin|L|1|order=flip|adj=mid}} V8 engine choices. In October, recognising the fuel crisis, Ford introduced a Fairlane with a {{convert|250|cuin|L|1|order=flip|adj=mid}} inline-six from the Falcon.\n\nThe LTD version of the ZJ surfaced in October 1979 as the FC Series, using the same wheelbase and body panels as the Fairlane. In mid-1980, the Falcon 4.1-litre alloy head engine was made optional, the first time the LTD was available in six-cylinder guise.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"120px\">\nFile:1982 Ford LTD (FC) sedan (2015-05-29) 01.jpg|Ford LTD (FC)\nFile:1982 Ford LTD (FC) sedan (2015-05-29) 03.jpg|Ford LTD (FC)\nFile:1981 Ford FC LTD Cartier (6058256901).jpg|Ford LTD (FC) Cartier\n</gallery>\n\n==== {{anchor|ZK|FD}} ZK / FD (1982\u20131984) ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = 200\n| image1 = 1982-1984 Ford Fairlane (ZK) sedan (2012-01-15) 01.jpg\n| image2 = 1982-1984 Ford Fairlane (ZK) sedan (2012-01-15) 02.jpg\n| footer = 1982\u20131984 Ford Fairlane (ZK)\n}}\n\nThe ZK series of March 1982 had the deletion of the 5.8-L V8, which was the first warning the company would soon drop [[V8 engine|V8s]] from the local line-up. Minor changes were made to grille and taillights, but otherwise the external changes were negligible. In March 1983, the 4.9-L V8 was deleted, too, with Ford introducing a [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]] version of the six to take its place, claiming the new engine had  acceleration figures equivalent to the V8.\n\nThe main notable mechanical change was the introduction of the coil sprung, watts link-located rear axle, one of the best live rear-axle configurations.\n\nThe LTD FC series was updated to and designated FD in March 1982 with the V8 engine option deleted the following year.\n{{clear}}\n\n==== {{anchor|ZL|FE}} ZL / FE (1984\u20131988) ====\n[[File:1984-1986 Ford ZL Fairlane sedan (2011-01-05) 02.jpg|thumb|Ford Fairlane (ZL)]]\n\nThe revised ZL series of 1985 (launched October 1984) kept the two six-cylinder engine options; only at the end of 1986 was the carburettor version of the Fairlane deleted. The ZL again carried over all external panels, but now had integrated headlights with clear indicators, full wrap-around bumpers, and new taillights. Inside, a full digital dashboard was introduced with push-button controls at either end of the instrument binnacle. The FE series LTD was also released in October 1984.<ref>The Red Book Used Car Price Guide, November 1985, page 57</ref>\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"120px\">\nFile:1987 Ford LTD (FE) sedan (2015-07-14) 01.jpg|Ford LTD (FE)\nFile:1987 Ford LTD (FE) sedan (2015-07-14) 02.jpg|Ford LTD (FE)\n</gallery>\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Fourth generation ===\n==== NA / DA (1988\u20131991) ====\n[[File:1989-1991 Ford DA II LTD sedan (2010-12-28).jpg|thumb|right|Ford LTD (DA II)]]\n{{multiple image | align = right | direction = horizontal | width = 200\n| image1 = 1990 Ford Fairlane (NA II) sedan (26021769001).jpg\n| image2 = 1990 Ford Fairlane (NA II) sedan (2010-07-25).jpg\n| footer = Ford Fairlane (NA II)\n}}\n\nJune 1988 had the next major revision; the Fairlane's straight edges gave way to gentle curves, based on the EA26 platform Falcon. The philosophy was the same - a long-wheelbase Falcon with a six-light body. The 4.1-L six was heavily revised, becoming a 3.9-L unit with improved fuel economy and power. These models were part of the EA26 development programme and platform (E for the market segment, A for Australia, 26 the project code). Therefore, officially they were EA26s, but colloquially, Ford aficionados prefer a two-letter code. Hence, the new Fairlanes were given the NA series code.\n\nThe equivalent LTDs came on stream as the DA series in June 1988. Like the previous generation, all N-series Fairlanes and D-series LTDs were built on the Falcon/Fairmont station-wagon platform, and this legacy is most noticeable in the disproportionally narrow station-wagon rear doors on what was meant to be a limousine and in a car that otherwise caters well for rear-seat passengers with a large amount of interior seating and legroom space. Nonetheless, these large sedans were \"limousine enough\" to be one of the most common platforms used by Australian body-building companies to make stretch limousines.\n\nRevisions from November 1989 for the 1990 model year had the release of the NA II and DAII, the most notable change being the fitting of a four-speed, rather than three-speed, automatic transmission (since the Fairlane's debut, it had a three-speed).\n\nAlthough Ford Australia's former official historian, the late Adrian Ryan, was emphatic, officially, an NB series Fairlane never existed, at least one early 1989 prototype fitted with a four-speed automatic escaped from the factory bearing a compliance plate marked \"NB\" and was registered as an \"NB Fairlane\". Ford also produced an alloy wheel identification-guide poster for its parts counters listing one wheel as being for an \"NB Sportsman Fairlane\" and at one point the Series II NA likely was going to be called the NB. Third-party parts suppliers also often list both an \"NB Fairlane\" an \"NB \u2013 Series II Fairlane\" in their parts catalogues adding to the NB mystery. DOTARS (the Commonwealth Department of Transport and Regional Services) has no record of giving Ford approval to use an \"NB Fairlane\" compliance plate for a production model which might explain Ford's reluctance to officially acknowledge the \"NB\". {{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}{{original research inline|date=April 2012}}\n\n==== NC / DC (1991\u20131995) ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right | direction = horizontal | width = 200\n| image1 = 1994 Ford Fairlane (NC II) Ghia sedan (2011-11-30) 01.jpg\n| image2 = 1994 Ford Fairlane (NC II) Ghia sedan (2011-11-30) 02.jpg\n| footer = 1993 Ford Fairlane (NC II) Ghia sedan\n}}\n\n[[File:1994 Ford LTD (DC II) sedan (2015-07-03) 01.jpg|thumb|right|1994 Ford LTD (DC II)]]\n\nAugust 1991 had the news that many Fairlane/LTD purists had awaited: the reintroduction of the V8 in the NC Fairlane and DC-series LTD. Ford had never recovered from deleting the V8s in the 1980s and bowed to public pressure with its reintroduction. The 5.0-L engine was not identical to the one used in the United States Mustang and other passenger cars. For reason of better durability and perhaps cost, it was the Canadian-made Windsor engine used in the North American light truck and 4WD models. To meet the needs of the space required for a right-drive steering column, its inlet manifold was reversed. Again to meet the conversion to right-hand drive and the rerouted inlet ducting, air box, and air conditioning lines, the Australian-installed engines also had most of their serpentine belt-driven accessories on opposite side to the US/North American models. As Australian enthusiasts often found to their frustration, these subtle changes often meant that many Ford Racing/SVO add-on bits, like the available superchargers, were not exactly the bolt-on items they were in North America. The inline six continued. The NC also introduced a higher-spec Fairlane, called the Fairlane Ghia, and the V8 was available in this model.\n\nThe 1992 NC II and DC IIs redesignated the 3.9-L engine a \"4.0-litre\", but trim levels remained the same. To appeal to younger buyers, Ford briefly sold a Fairlane Sportsman Ghia in 1993 with a \"Tickford\"-tuned 4.0-L six used in the Falcon XR6.\nA second, even smaller update, known as the NC III, arrived in August 1993. It is the equivalent to the ED series Falcon, adopting the new \"ozone safe\" R134a air conditioning refrigerant. The base Fairlane model was also discontinued, leaving only the Fairlane Ghia.\n\nFrom March 1994 production, the NC received additional changes - the fitment of a leather-wrapped steering wheel, body-coloured bumpers and side protection strips, new-design alloy wheels, and a [[hood ornament|bonnet ornament]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://fordfalconfacts.com/model-specs/fairlane-ltd/nc-fairlane-dc-ltd-1991-1995/ | title = NC Fairlane / DC LTD | publisher = Falcon Facts | accessdate = 14 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nAn idea proposed in the late 1980s was a Fairlane wagon. Most likely, had it entered production, it would have used the Falcon wagon (which rode on the Fairlane's wheelbase) body, coupled with the Fairlane's front clip.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}{{original research inline|date=November 2009}}\n\nIn the early 1990s, the Falcon utilities were still of the previous-generation XF. A prototype EB Falcon utility was made which looked Fairlane-based. To impart a look of solidness, the ute had a Fairlane frontal treatment. It did not enter production.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==== NF / DF (1995\u20131996) ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right | direction = horizontal\n| image1 = Ford Fairlane Ghia (4).jpg | width1 = 180\n| image2 = 1995-1996 Ford LTD (DF) sedan (2011-03-23).jpg  | width2 = 242\n| footer = Ford Fairlane Ghia (NF; left) and Ford LTD (DF; right)\n}}\n\nThe Fairlane and LTD received a major front and rear restyle in March 1995 (EA77 series in Ford-speak), coinciding with the EF Falcon, and remained on the same platform. The new NF Fairlanes and DF LTDs were longer and curvier, hiding their 1980s origins reasonably well. The exterior design was more ornamental compared to the relatively clean NAs to NCs. The Fairlane Sportsman reappeared for 1996, with the same formula as 1993, with the 4.0-L six.{{Clear}}\n\n==== NL / DL (1996\u20131999) ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right | direction = horizontal | width = 200\n| image1 = 1998 Ford Fairlane (NL) Ghia sedan (24141149516).jpg\n| image2 = 1998 Ford Fairlane (NL) Ghia sedan (24059154062).jpg\n| footer =  Ford Fairlane (NL) Ghia\n}}\n\n[[File:1997 Ford LTD (DL) sedan (2015-07-03) 01.jpg|thumb|right|Ford LTD (DL)]]\nIn September 1996, the revised NL Fairlanes and DL LTDs appeared. In 1997, Ford introduced a higher Fairlane Concorde trim, with the same 4.0- and 5.0-L engine choices. No Sportsman variant of the Fairlane was offered.\n\nFor customers, five Dealer modified NL Series Fairlanes from Sydney and Melbourne utilised parts from the 5.0-litre [[Mustang Cobra]] and Australian delivered [[Special Vehicle Operations|SVO]] parts due to the limited edition run of the Fairlane by Tickford and customers wanting to maintain the Luxury look but sport the GT's performance.  The rounded body lines were reminiscent of the US-market Ford Taurus, while the front end styling was similar to the Lincoln Town Car.\n\nFord expanded the Fairlane range greatly in 1998. Beginning with the Ghia, also a basic Concorde (six-cylinder) and Concorde Ghia (V8) were offered. A [[Tickford Vehicle Engineering|Tickford]]-modified version was also available, with the larger engine, as well as a luxurious Fairlane Special Edition Ghia.\n\nThe NL and DL series were the last models to come equipped with automatic self-leveling rear suspension.\n{{clear}}\n\nThe New Zealand Government also used the NL Fairlane Ghia as their designated Crown Limousines. All Crown Fairlanes were mostly painted Amaretto (a few in white) and were fitted with silver chonchorde 16 inch wheels, 6 disc cd stacker electric adjust drivers seat and New Zealand fitted flag pole mounts on the front guards. \n\nAll of the Fairlane Ghias used by the New Zealand Government were fitted with the factory 4.0L six cylinder engine producing 165kw. The LTD was also used with only a few being V8 models. The LTD Crown Cars were a range of colours including Dynamic White, Argon Silver and Mocha Foam. The NL and DL Crown cars all sported special government licence plates starting with CR404 and continuing in numerical order to CR437. Most crown cars were retired after 3 years of service. The Fairlane and LTD had been used by the New Zealand Government since the 1970s through to 2010s where the Ford brand was replaced with BMW 7 series. \n\nThe New Zealand Government still uses CR registration plates on their current Crown Cars.\n\nPlease note, pre-facelift NF and DF Fairlanes were also used by the New Zealand Government.\n\n=== Fifth generation ===\n==== AU (1999\u20132003) ====\n[[File:2001 Ford Fairlane (AU II) Ghia sedan (2015-07-24) 01.jpg|thumb|Ford Fairlane (AU II) Ghia]]\n{{multiple image\n| align = right | direction = horizontal | width = 200\n| image1 = 2002 Ford LTD (AU II) sedan (2010-07-05) 01.jpg\n| image2 = 2002 Ford LTD (AU II) sedan (2010-07-05) 02.jpg\n| footer = 2000\u20132003 Ford LTD (AU II)\n}}\n\nFord introduced its \"[[New Edge]]\" look to the AU series Fairlane in February 1999, with some success, though the EA169 platform was considered a flop, allowing rival [[Holden]] to overtake the company in the sales of full-sized cars. The AU LTD was released 3 months later in May.\n\nThe AU Fairlane and LTD models were the first long-wheelbase sedans to share a model code with the Falcon. They had [[Lincoln Town Car]] styling cues, especially around the [[C-pillar]]. The range was pared back to just two models, the Fairlane Ghia and the LTD, although a limited-edition Fairlane Millennium Ghia was also offered in January 2000.<ref>[http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/carfamilytree?ReadForm&ID=D62DD4AB47EC387FCA257125001A1418 Ford AU Fairlane].

The 2001 model year AU II models featured some improvements, and another limited edition was offered: the 75th Anniversary Ghia in October, with the same engine choices as before. The Sportsman Ghia was revived in March 2001 and lasted for more than one model year this time, remaining in the range to the end of 2002.\n\n==== BA (2003\u20132005) ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right | direction = horizontal | image1 = 2003-2005 Ford BA Fairlane G220 sedan 01.jpg | width1 = 165\n| image2 = 2003-2005 Ford BA Fairlane G220 sedan (2011-03-09).jpg | width2 = 210\n| footer = 2003\u20132005 Ford Fairlane (BA) G220\n}}\n\nFord's new attempt to battle Holden came in July 2003 with the BA series. The BA Fairlanes and LTDs were closer to the Falcon in looks, even sharing the taillights. The 5.0-L gave way to the larger 5.4-L [[Ford Modular engine#5.4 L|Modular]] V8, already used in the US From this point the LTD was no longer offered with a six-cylinder engine.\n\nTo capture younger buyers, the Fairlane G220 (denoting its {{convert|220|kW|hp|adj=mid}} power output at 4,750&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|472|Nm|lbft}} of torque from 3,250\u20134,000&nbsp;rpm) took the place of the Fairlane Sportsman, and featured the larger engine only. The traditional automatic gearbox was replaced by a [[tiptronic|sequential automatic]]. Unique to the G220 were 17-inch Elegance alloy wheels, ebony headlight bezels with unique lens, and redline leather seats with warm charcoal, perforated leather inserts.\n\nThe Fairlane Ghia continued as the six-cylinder base model, but came standard with colour ICC screen, asix-CD stack, 11-speaker Premium Sound, 7-way adjustable leather seats, and woodgrain inserts.\n\nThe LTD was further distinguished from the Ghia by having the 5.4-L V8 engine, sunroof, 17-inch alloy wheels, LTD badging, 10-way adjustable front seats, bolstered rear seats, [[satellite navigation]], and auto-dimming rear-vision mirror.<ref>{{cite web |last=Torr |first=Feann |year=2003 |url=http://www.webwombat.com.au/motoring/news_reports/xfd_fairlane.htm |title=First Drive: BA Ford Fairlane |publisher=Web Wombat |access-date=20 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nBrakes were the same as on the Falcon, with Fairlanes coming standard with [[electronic brakeforce distribution]] and [[traction control]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mynrma.com.au/motoring-services/reviews/car-reviews/ford/fairlane-ghia-ba-g220-ltd.htm |title=Ford Fairlane Ghia BA G220 & LTD Car Review |publisher=[[NRMA]] |date=1 March 2004 |access-date=20 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nFollowing Ford Australia's introduction of the BA II Falcon in October 2004, facelifted versions of the Fairlane Ghia, Fairlane G220, and LTD were introduced in March 2005. The changes were mainly cosmetic, but nevertheless significant, and were carried over in the subsequent BF model ranges. The facelifted Fairlane was headlined by a more heavily chromed exterior, including chrome rub strips, a new chromed rear appliqu\u00e9,  and on Fairlane Ghia and LTD, chromed wing mirror covers. The G220 was given new-design seven-spoke alloy wheels, while Fairlane Ghia and LTD added two-toned paint to their side skirts and lower valances.\n\nFor the BA II interior, the black leather seats and leather section of the door trims were replaced with new leather trim dubbed China Beige. The Ghia and G220 gained an eight-way power driver\u2019s seat with memory function. The G220 was given a leather-wrapped sports steering wheel, and the Ghia a Rhui Maple woodgrain and leather steering wheel, and the LTD gained a Stone Maple woodgrain and leather steering wheel.\n\nWhile the only BA II mechanical change was the addition of Sports Control Blade rear-suspension tune for the base Ghia and top-shelf LTD, a DVD rear entertainment system became standard for the LTD, exchangeable for a sunroof.\n\nAn interior upgrade that would be carried over in its entirety to the subsequent BF range was the change from black to brushed silver instrument dials and dash clock, and the silver shifter surround, centre cup holder, and ICC fascia became \"piano black\" with the ICC buttons changed accordingly from black to silver. Chrome door handles, vent tips, and door lock barrels were also added.<ref>{{cite web |last=Pettendy |first=Marton |date=4 February 2005 |url=http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/F5855C5E817D447CCA256F9D007C8CFA |title=Comfort is king in Ford's fresh Fairlane |work=GoAuto |access-date=20 August 2016}}</ref> The original woodgrain trim was retained until the BF.\n\n==== BF (2005\u20132007) ====\n[[File:2007 Ford Fairlane (BF) Ghia sedan (2015-07-24).jpg|thumb|2005\u20132007 Ford Fairlane (BF) Ghia]]\n{{multiple image | align = right | direction = horizontal\n| image1 = 2006 Ford LTD (BF) sedan (2015-07-24) 01.jpg\n| image2 = 2006 Ford LTD (BF) sedan (2015-07-24) 02.jpg \n| footer = 2005\u20132007 Ford LTD (BF)\n}}\n\nThe BF series Fairlane and LTD models were introduced in October 2005, with the Fairlane G220 renamed the Fairlane G8. Externally, the BF was outwardly identical to the BA Mark II, but fine tunings to steering, suspension, soundproofing and undercarriage were made. Fuel economy was also improved. Across the whole BF range, the taillight lenses were slightly changed in appearance. The Ghia went from 16-inch to 17-inch alloy wheels as standard.\n\nInterior-wise, the only changes from the upgrades introduced in the BA Mark II were the replacement of the woodgrain inserts with \"satin chrome\" inserts. This colour scheme was the same for all BF Fairlane variants. The BF Ghia and LTD came with black leather seats or China beige leather seats with eight-way adjustable drivers seat and six-way adjustable passenger seat.\n\nThe G8 featured an eight-cylinder engine with improved exhaust system and an additional knock sensor, producing  {{convert|230|kW|hp}} at 5,350&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|500|Nm|lbft}} of torque at 3,500&nbsp;rpm.<ref>[http://www.privatefleet.com.au/buying-new-car/car-reviews/ford/ford-fairlane-review/ Ford Fairlane at www.privatefleet.com.au].

The first generation Pilot was released in April 2002 as a 2003 model.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.autonews.com/assets/PDF/CA38821213.PDF|title=2004 Car Cutaways|newspaper=Automotive News|accessdate=2015-11-08}}</ref>\n\nThe Pilot shares its [[Car platform|platform]] with the [[Acura MDX]], as well as the [[Honda Odyssey (North America)|Odyssey]] [[minivan]] and the [[Honda Accord|Accord]] sedan. The Pilot's unibody construction and [[independent suspension]] are designed to provide handling similar to that of a car, and it has integrated perimeter frame rails to allow towing and light [[Off-roading|off-road use]].\n\nPrior to the introduction of the Pilot, Honda marketed the compact crossover [[Honda CR-V|CR-V]] and the [[Honda Passport]] (a [[Badge engineering|rebadged]] [[Isuzu MU|Isuzu Rodeo]]) that was a pickup truck-based design. The Pilot is Honda's largest SUV, although the 2010 [[Honda Accord Crosstour|Crosstour]] surpassed the Pilot in length.<ref>{{cite web|last=Giametta |first=Chuck |url= http://iguida.com/2010-car-comparison-traverse-pilot-highlander |title=2010 Car Comparison: Chevrolet Traverse v Honda Pilot v Toyota Highlander |publisher=iGuida |date=2010-03-21 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130507055459/http://iguida.com/2010-car-comparison-traverse-pilot-highlander |archivedate=2013-05-07 |accessdate=2015-01-07}}</ref>\n\nThe Pilot is sold in North America and the Middle East, while the Honda MDX (first generation Acura MDX) was marketed in Japan and Australia for several years.

Both engines were rated at {{Convert|244|hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|240|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque; the power reduction is because Honda used the updated SAE net power standard.\u00a0 This was the first time 4WD was not standard on the Pilot. \n\nThe new FWD models featured Honda's Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) system, which can deactivate up to three cylinders under light load to increase fuel economy, to help control noise from the system Honda added Active Control Engine Mount System (ACM) and Active Noise Cancellation ([[Active noise control|ANC]]).\u00a0 Further this version of the J35 featured updated iVTEC and the automatic transmission a shorter 1st gear ratio.\u00a0 With powertrain updates and the lack of VTM-4 the FWD version had improved fuel economy of 18-city/24-highway, an increase of +1/+2 mpg versus the 4WD.\n\nAll Pilots from this generation feature a 5-speed automatic transmission. The Pilot has front struts with a coil-spring, multilink rear suspension for a flat rear load floor. Front track is 66.3 in (1,684 mm) and 66.5 in (1,689 mm) at the rear. The Pilot has a 4,500 lb (2,041 kg) boat/3,500 lb (1,588 kg) trailer towing capability with the optional dealer installed towing package.\n\nPilots with Honda's Variable Torque Management 4WD system (VTM-4) sent most power to the front wheels under normal driving conditions. Under acceleration or if wheel slippage is detected at the front wheels, up to 50% of power can be sent to the rear wheels. The system also features a VTM-4 lock button on the dashboard which locks the rear differential and sends 25% of the power to each rear wheel. However, the VTM-4 lock function only operates in first gear, second gear and reverse, and automatically disengages above {{Convert|18|mph|0|abbr=on}}, then re-engages when the speed drops below {{Convert|18|mph|0|abbr=on}}.\n\n===Design===\nDesign of the Pilot was by Honda's Ricky Hsu through 1999, when styling was approved. The Pilot can accommodate up to eight passengers in three rows configured as [[stadium seating]]. The third row can seat three, but the limited legroom makes it suitable only for small children or adults on short trips. Similar to the [[Honda Odyssey (North America)|Honda Odyssey]], the rear seats can be folded into flat surfaces for larger cargo. Options include powered [[moonroof]], [[DVD]] entertainment system, and a [[Automotive navigation system|navigation system]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/USD460022|title=Patent USD460022 - Vehicle body|work=google.com|accessdate=2015-11-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |url=http://world.honda.com/news/2001/c011213_1.html |title=All-New Honda Pilot Sport-Utility Vehicle Set to Debut Next Year Pre-Production Model to be Shown at NAIAS |date=2001-12-13 |work=honda.com |accessdate=2015-11-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304091813/http://world.honda.com/news/2001/c011213_1.html |archivedate=2016-03-04 }}</ref>\n\nOther  features include [[Anti-lock brakes|ABS]]-equipped four-wheel [[disc brake]]s, rack-and-pinion steering, four-wheel independent suspension, and 282\u00b0 of outward visibility.\n\n====2004 changes====\nFor the 2004 model year, Honda increased adjustability on second row seats and added heated front seats and side mirrors to models equipped with leather seats. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.autoblog.com/buy/2004-Honda-Pilot/expert-review/|title=2004 Honda Pilot New Car Test Drive|website=Autoblog|language=en|access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref>\n\n====2005 changes====\nFor the 2005 model year, Honda added tire pressure monitoring, electronic stability control, revised steering, and upgraded the air bags.\n\n===2006 facelift===\n[[File:Honda Pilot EX 4WD 2008.jpg|thumb|right|2006-2008 Honda Pilot]]\nHonda revised the Pilot for the 2006 model year in October 2005.

The EX trim level received redesigned wheels, and the original EX wheels were now found on the LX trim. On the inside, side airbags were provided in the C pillar, the gauge cluster was updated and the center console featured chrome trim and redesigned storage compartments and cup holders. For the 2006 model year, Honda added Variable Cylinder Management to the two-wheel-drive models. This VCM tech proved to be problematic in some cases, which led to a class action lawsuit for Honda Motor Co. <ref>https://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/closed-settlements/5323-honda-engine-misfire-class-action-lawsuit-settlement/</ref>\n \n====2007 changes====\nFor the 2007 model year, Honda added Nimbus Gray Metallic, Dark Cherry Pearl, Aberdeen Green Metallic and Formal Black as four new colors to all models. \n\n====2008 changes====\nFor the last model year of the generation Honda added two new trims.

Both engines were rated at {{Convert|244|hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|240|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque; the power reduction is because Honda used the updated SAE net power standard.\u00a0 This was the first time 4WD was not standard on the Pilot. \n\nThe new FWD models featured Honda's Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) system, which can deactivate up to three cylinders under light load to increase fuel economy, to help control noise from the system Honda added Active Control Engine Mount System (ACM) and Active Noise Cancellation ([[Active noise control|ANC]]).\u00a0 Further this version of the J35 featured updated iVTEC and the automatic transmission a shorter 1st gear ratio.\u00a0 With powertrain updates and the lack of VTM-4 the FWD version had improved fuel economy of 18-city/24-highway, an increase of +1/+2 mpg versus the 4WD.\n\nAll Pilots from this generation feature a 5-speed automatic transmission. The Pilot has front struts with a coil-spring, multilink rear suspension for a flat rear load floor. Front track is 66.3 in (1,684 mm) and 66.5 in (1,689 mm) at the rear. The Pilot has a 4,500 lb (2,041 kg) boat/3,500 lb (1,588 kg) trailer towing capability with the optional dealer installed towing package.\n\nPilots with Honda's Variable Torque Management 4WD system (VTM-4) sent most power to the front wheels under normal driving conditions. Under acceleration or if wheel slippage is detected at the front wheels, up to 50% of power can be sent to the rear wheels. The system also features a VTM-4 lock button on the dashboard which locks the rear differential and sends 25% of the power to each rear wheel. However, the VTM-4 lock function only operates in first gear, second gear and reverse, and automatically disengages above {{Convert|18|mph|0|abbr=on}}, then re-engages when the speed drops below {{Convert|18|mph|0|abbr=on}}.\n\n===Design===\nDesign of the Pilot was by Honda's Ricky Hsu through 1999, when styling was approved. The Pilot can accommodate up to eight passengers in three rows configured as [[stadium seating]]. The third row can seat three, but the limited legroom makes it suitable only for small children or adults on short trips. Similar to the [[Honda Odyssey (North America)|Honda Odyssey]], the rear seats can be folded into flat surfaces for larger cargo.
