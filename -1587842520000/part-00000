{"title_page": "Yankee", "text_new": "{{about|the term}}\nThe term \"'''Yankee'''\" and its contracted form \"'''Yank'''\" have several interrelated meanings, all referring to people from the United States; its various senses depend on the context. Outside the united States of America, \"Yank\" is used informally to refer to any American, including Southerners. Within the [[Southern United States|Southern united States of America]] \"Yankee\" is a derisive term which refers to all Northerners, or specifically to those from the region of [[New England]]. According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', it is \"a nickname for a native or inhabitant of New England, or, more widely, of the northern States generally\"; during the [[American Civil War]], it was \"applied by the Confederates to the soldiers of the Federal army\".\n\nElsewhere in the united States of America it largely refers to people from the Northeastern states, but especially those with [[New England]] cultural ties, such as descendants of [[colonial New England]] settlers, wherever they live.<ref name=\"ruth\">{{cite journal|year=1963|title=Swamp Yankee|journal=American Speech|volume=38|issue=2|pages=121\u2013123|doi=10.2307/453288|jstor=453288|author=Ruth Schell}}</ref> Its sense is sometimes more cultural than geographical, emphasizing the Calvinist Puritan Christian beliefs and traditions of the Congregationalists who brought their culture when they settled outside New England.

In the 18th century, it referred to residents of New England descended from the original English settlers of the region. [[Mark Twain]] used the word in this sense the following century in his novel ''[[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]'', published in 1889. As early as the 1770s, British people applied the term to any person from the United States. In the 19th century, Americans in the southern United States employed the word in reference to Americans from the northern United States, though not to recent immigrants from Europe. Thus, a visitor to [[Richmond, Virginia]] commented in 1818, \"The enterprising people are mostly strangers; Scots, Irish, and especially New England men, or Yankees, as they are called\".<ref>See Mathews, (1951) pp. 1896\u201398 and [http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50288716 ''Oxford English Dictionary'', quoting M. Birkbeck]</ref>\n\n===Rejected etymologies===\nMany etymologies have been suggested for the word ''Yankee'', but modern linguists generally reject theories which suggest that it originated in any Indian languages.<ref name=\"MW\"/> This includes a theory purported by a British officer in 1789, who said that it was derived from the [[Cherokee language|Cherokee]] word ''eankke'' (\"coward\")\u2014despite the fact that no such word existed in the Cherokee language.<ref name=\"MW\">''The Merriam-Webster new book of word histories'' (1991) pp. 516\u2013517.</ref> Another theory surmised that the word was borrowed from the [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]]<ref>The Wyandot people were called Hurons by the French.</ref> pronunciation of the French ''l'anglais'', meaning \"the Englishman\" or \"the English language\", which was sounded as ''Y'an-gee''.<ref name=\"MW\"/><ref>Mathews (1951) p.&nbsp;1896.</ref>\n\nAmerican musicologist [[Oscar Sonneck]] debunked a romanticized false etymology in his 1909 work ''Report on \"The Star-Spangled Banner\", \"Hail Columbia\", \"America\", \"Yankee Doodle\"''. He cited a popular theory which claimed that the word came from a tribe who called themselves ''Yankoos'', said to mean \"invincible\". The story claimed that New Englanders had defeated this tribe after a bloody battle, and the remaining ''Yankoo'' Indians transferred their name to the victors\u2014who were \"agreeable to the Indian custom\". Sonneck notes that multiple American writers since 1775 had repeated this story as if it were fact, despite what he perceived to be holes in it. It had never been the tradition of any Indian tribe to transfer their name to other peoples, according to Sonneck, nor had any settlers ever adopted an Indian name to describe themselves.<ref>This is not to be confused with adopting an Indian name for a geographical location.</ref> Sonneck concludes by pointing out that there was never a tribe called the ''Yankoos''.<ref>{{cite book | last = Sonneck | first = O.

Quinion and Hanks posit that it was \"used as a nickname for a Dutch-speaking American in colonial times\" and could have grown to include non-Dutch colonists, as well.<ref name=posh/> Alternatively, the Dutch given names ''Jan'' ({{IPA-nl|j\u0251n|lang}}) and ''Kees'' ({{IPA-nl|ke\u02d0s|lang}}) have long been common, and the two are sometimes combined into a single name (e.g., [[Jan Kees de Jager]]). Its Anglicized spelling ''Yankee'' could, in this way, have been used to mock Dutch colonists. The chosen name ''Jan Kees'' may have been partly inspired by a dialectal rendition of ''Jan Kaas'' (\"John Cheese\"), the generic nickname that Southern Dutch used for Dutch people living in the North.<ref name=yanky>Harper, Douglas.

The character was a plain-speaking American who becomes an example for Nova Scotians to follow in his industry and practicality; and his uncouth manners and vanity were the epitome of qualities that his creator detested. The character was developed by [[Thomas Chandler Haliburton]], and it grew between 1836 and 1844 in a series of publications.<ref name = DCB>Cogswell, F.

The original Yankees diffused widely across the northern United States, leaving their imprints in New York, the [[Upper Midwest]], and places as far away as [[Seattle]], [[San Francisco]], and [[Honolulu]].<ref>Mathews (1909), Holbrook (1950)</ref> Yankees typically lived in villages consisting of clusters of separate farms.  Often they were merchants, bankers, teachers, or professionals.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kenneth J. Winkle|title=The Young Eagle: The Rise of Abraham Lincoln|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JcEVAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA78|year=2001|publisher=Taylor |page=78|isbn=9781461734369}}</ref> Village life fostered local democracy, best exemplified by the open [[town meeting]] form of government which still exists today in New England. Village life also stimulated mutual oversight of moral behavior and emphasized civic virtue. From the New England seaports of [[Boston]], [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], and [[New London, Connecticut|New London]], among others, the Yankees built international trade routes, stretching to China by 1800. Much of the profit from trading was reinvested in the textile and machine tools industries.<ref>Knights (1991)</ref>\n\n===Stereotypes===\n[[Yankee ingenuity]] was a worldwide stereotype of inventiveness, technical solutions to practical problems, \"know-how,\" self-reliance, and individual enterprise.<ref>Eugene S. Ferguson, \"On the Origin and Development of American Mechanical 'know-how'\", ''American Studies'' 3.2 (1962): 3\u201316. [https://journals.ku.edu/index.php/amerstud/article/viewFile/2075/2034 online]</ref> The stereotype first appeared in the 19th century. As Mitchell Wilson notes, \"Yankee ingenuity and Yankee git-up-and-go did not exist in colonial days.\"<ref>quoted in Reynold M. Wik, \"Some interpretations of the mechanization of agriculture in the Far West.\" ''Agricultural History'' (1975): 73\u201383. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3742110 in JSTOR]</ref> The great majority of Yankees gravitated toward the burgeoning cities of the northeast, while wealthy New Englanders also sent ambassadors to frontier communities where they became influential bankers and newspaper printers. They introduced the term \"Universal Yankee Nation\" to proselytize their hopes for national and global influence.<ref>Susan E. Gray, ''The Yankee West: community life on the Michigan frontier'' (1996) p. 3</ref>\n\n===Religion===\nIn religion, New England Yankees originally followed the [[Puritan]] tradition, as expressed in [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregational churches]]. Beginning in the late colonial period, many became Presbyterians, [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]], [[Methodism|Methodists]], [[American Baptist Churches USA|Baptists]], or, later, [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]]. Strait-laced 17th-century moralism as derided by novelist [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] faded in the 18th century. The [[First Great Awakening]] (under [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] and others) in the mid-18th century and the [[Second Great Awakening]] in the early 19th century (under [[Charles Grandison Finney]], among others) emphasized personal piety, revivals, and devotion to civic duty. Theologically, [[Arminianism]] replaced the original [[Calvinism]]. [[Horace Bushnell]] introduced the idea of Christian nurture, through which children would be brought to religion without revivals.\n\n===Politics and reform===\nAfter 1800, Yankees spearheaded most reform movements, including those for abolition of slavery, temperance in use of alcohol, increase in women's political rights, and improvement in women's education. [[Emma Willard]] and [[Mary Lyon]] pioneered in the higher education of women, while Yankees comprised most of the reformers who went South during [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] in the late 1860s to educate the [[Freedman|Freedmen]].<ref>Taylor (1979)</ref>\n\nHistorian John Buenker has examined the worldview of the Yankee settlers in the Midwest:<blockquote>Because they arrived first and had a strong sense of community and mission, Yankees were able to transplant New England institutions, values, and mores, altered only by the conditions of frontier life.  They established a public culture that emphasized the work ethic, the sanctity of private property, individual responsibility, faith in residential and social mobility, practicality, piety, public order and decorum, reverence for public education, activists, honest, and frugal government, town meeting democracy, and he believed that there was a public interest that transcends particular and stock ambitions.  Regarding themselves as the elect and just in a world rife with sin and corruption, they felt a strong moral obligation to define and enforce standards of community and personal behavior\u2026.  This pietistic worldview was substantially shared by British, Scandinavian, Swiss, English-Canadian and Dutch Reformed immigrants, as well as by German Protestants and many of the Forty-Eighters.<ref>John Buenker, \"Wisconsin\" in {{cite book|last=James H. Madison, ed. |title=Heartland: Comparative Histories of the Midwestern States |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TMUCo0UXCjoC&pg=PA72|year=1988|publisher=Indiana University Press|pages=72\u201373|isbn=0253314232}}</ref></blockquote>Yankees dominated New England, much of [[upstate New York]], and much of the upper Midwest, and were the strongest supporters of the new Republican party in the 1860s. This was especially true for the [[Congregationalists]], [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]]s, and (after 1860) the Methodists among them. A study of 65 predominantly Yankee counties showed that they voted only 40% for the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]] in 1848 and 1852, but became 61\u201365% [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] in presidential elections of 1856 through 1864.<ref>Kleppner p 55</ref>\n\n[[Ivy League]] universities remained bastions of old Yankee culture until well after [[World War II]], particularly [[History of Harvard University|Harvard]] and [[Yale University|Yale]], as well as \"[[Little Ivies|Little Ivy]]\" [[liberal arts]] colleges.\n\n===Yankee stereotypes===\nPresident [[Calvin Coolidge]] exemplified the modern Yankee stereotype. Coolidge moved from rural [[Vermont]] to urban [[Massachusetts]] and was educated at elite [[Amherst College]]. Yet his flint-faced, unprepossessing ways and terse rural speech proved politically attractive. \"That Yankee twang will be worth a hundred thousand votes\", explained one Republican leader.<ref>William Allen White, ''A Puritan in Babylon: The Story of Calvin Coolidge'' (1938) p. 122.</ref> Coolidge's laconic ways and dry humor were characteristic of stereotypical rural \"Yankee humor\" at the turn of the 20th century.<ref>Arthur George Crandall, [https://books.google.com/books?id=AhXdAf0lBqwC&pg=PA13&dq=%22new+england+joke+lore%22 ''New England Joke Lore: The Tonic of Yankee Humor''], (F.A.

Traditionally, ''Yankee'' was most often used to refer to a New Englander descended from the original settlers of the region, thus often suggesting Puritanism and thrifty values.<ref>Bushman, (1967)</ref> By the mid-20th century, some speakers applied the word to any American inhabiting the area north of the [[Mason\u2013Dixon Line]], though usually with a specific focus still on New England.

Outside the United States, \"Yank\" is used informally to refer to any American, including Southerners. Within the [[Southern United States]], \"Yankee\" is a derisive term which refers to all Northerners, or specifically to those from the region of [[New England]]. According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', it is \"a nickname for a native or inhabitant of New England, or, more widely, of the northern States generally\"; during the [[American Civil War]], it was \"applied by the Confederates to the soldiers of the Federal army\".\n\nElsewhere in the United States, it largely refers to people from the Northeastern states, but especially those with [[New England]] cultural ties, such as descendants of [[colonial New England]] settlers, wherever they live.<ref name=\"ruth\">{{cite journal|year=1963|title=Swamp Yankee|journal=American Speech|volume=38|issue=2|pages=121\u2013123|doi=10.2307/453288|jstor=453288|author=Ruth Schell}}</ref> Its sense is sometimes more cultural than geographical, emphasizing the Calvinist Puritan Christian beliefs and traditions of the Congregationalists who brought their culture when they settled outside New England.

In the 18th century, it referred to residents of New England descended from the original English settlers of the region. [[Mark Twain]] used the word in this sense the following century in his novel ''[[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]'', published in 1889. As early as the 1770s, British people applied the term to any person from the United States. In the 19th century, Americans in the southern United States employed the word in reference to Americans from the northern United States, though not to recent immigrants from Europe. Thus, a visitor to [[Richmond, Virginia]] commented in 1818, \"The enterprising people are mostly strangers; Scots, Irish, and especially New England men, or Yankees, as they are called\".<ref>See Mathews, (1951) pp. 1896\u201398 and [http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50288716 ''Oxford English Dictionary'', quoting M. Birkbeck]</ref>\n\n===Rejected etymologies===\nMany etymologies have been suggested for the word ''Yankee'', but modern linguists generally reject theories which suggest that it originated in any Indian languages.<ref name=\"MW\"/> This includes a theory purported by a British officer in 1789, who said that it was derived from the [[Cherokee language|Cherokee]] word ''eankke'' (\"coward\")\u2014despite the fact that no such word existed in the Cherokee language.<ref name=\"MW\">''The Merriam-Webster new book of word histories'' (1991) pp. 516\u2013517.</ref> Another theory surmised that the word was borrowed from the [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]]<ref>The Wyandot people were called Hurons by the French.</ref> pronunciation of the French ''l'anglais'', meaning \"the Englishman\" or \"the English language\", which was sounded as ''Y'an-gee''.<ref name=\"MW\"/><ref>Mathews (1951) p.&nbsp;1896.</ref>\n\nAmerican musicologist [[Oscar Sonneck]] debunked a romanticized false etymology in his 1909 work ''Report on \"The Star-Spangled Banner\", \"Hail Columbia\", \"America\", \"Yankee Doodle\"''. He cited a popular theory which claimed that the word came from a tribe who called themselves ''Yankoos'', said to mean \"invincible\". The story claimed that New Englanders had defeated this tribe after a bloody battle, and the remaining ''Yankoo'' Indians transferred their name to the victors\u2014who were \"agreeable to the Indian custom\". Sonneck notes that multiple American writers since 1775 had repeated this story as if it were fact, despite what he perceived to be holes in it. It had never been the tradition of any Indian tribe to transfer their name to other peoples, according to Sonneck, nor had any settlers ever adopted an Indian name to describe themselves.<ref>This is not to be confused with adopting an Indian name for a geographical location.</ref> Sonneck concludes by pointing out that there was never a tribe called the ''Yankoos''.<ref>{{cite book | last = Sonneck | first = O.

Quinion and Hanks posit that it was \"used as a nickname for a Dutch-speaking American in colonial times\" and could have grown to include non-Dutch colonists, as well.<ref name=posh/> Alternatively, the Dutch given names ''Jan'' ({{IPA-nl|j\u0251n|lang}}) and ''Kees'' ({{IPA-nl|ke\u02d0s|lang}}) have long been common, and the two are sometimes combined into a single name (e.g., [[Jan Kees de Jager]]). Its Anglicized spelling ''Yankee'' could, in this way, have been used to mock Dutch colonists. The chosen name ''Jan Kees'' may have been partly inspired by a dialectal rendition of ''Jan Kaas'' (\"John Cheese\"), the generic nickname that Southern Dutch used for Dutch people living in the North.<ref name=yanky>Harper, Douglas.

The character was a plain-speaking American who becomes an example for Nova Scotians to follow in his industry and practicality; and his uncouth manners and vanity were the epitome of qualities that his creator detested.

The original Yankees diffused widely across the northern United States, leaving their imprints in New York, the [[Upper Midwest]], and places as far away as [[Seattle]], [[San Francisco]], and [[Honolulu]].<ref>Mathews (1909), Holbrook (1950)</ref> Yankees typically lived in villages consisting of clusters of separate farms.  Often they were merchants, bankers, teachers, or professionals.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kenneth J. Winkle|title=The Young Eagle: The Rise of Abraham Lincoln|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JcEVAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA78|year=2001|publisher=Taylor |page=78|isbn=9781461734369}}</ref> Village life fostered local democracy, best exemplified by the open [[town meeting]] form of government which still exists today in New England. Village life also stimulated mutual oversight of moral behavior and emphasized civic virtue. From the New England seaports of [[Boston]], [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], and [[New London, Connecticut|New London]], among others, the Yankees built international trade routes, stretching to China by 1800. Much of the profit from trading was reinvested in the textile and machine tools industries.<ref>Knights (1991)</ref>\n\n===Stereotypes===\n[[Yankee ingenuity]] was a worldwide stereotype of inventiveness, technical solutions to practical problems, \"know-how,\" self-reliance, and individual enterprise.<ref>Eugene S. Ferguson, \"On the Origin and Development of American Mechanical 'know-how'\", ''American Studies'' 3.2 (1962): 3\u201316. [https://journals.ku.edu/index.php/amerstud/article/viewFile/2075/2034 online]</ref> The stereotype first appeared in the 19th century. As Mitchell Wilson notes, \"Yankee ingenuity and Yankee git-up-and-go did not exist in colonial days.\"<ref>quoted in Reynold M. Wik, \"Some interpretations of the mechanization of agriculture in the Far West.\" ''Agricultural History'' (1975): 73\u201383. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3742110 in JSTOR]</ref> The great majority of Yankees gravitated toward the burgeoning cities of the northeast, while wealthy New Englanders also sent ambassadors to frontier communities where they became influential bankers and newspaper printers. They introduced the term \"Universal Yankee Nation\" to proselytize their hopes for national and global influence.<ref>Susan E. Gray, ''The Yankee West: community life on the Michigan frontier'' (1996) p. 3</ref>\n\n===Religion===\nIn religion, New England Yankees originally followed the [[Puritan]] tradition, as expressed in [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregational churches]]. Beginning in the late colonial period, many became Presbyterians, [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]], [[Methodism|Methodists]], [[American Baptist Churches USA|Baptists]], or, later, [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]]. Strait-laced 17th-century moralism as derided by novelist [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] faded in the 18th century. The [[First Great Awakening]] (under [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] and others) in the mid-18th century and the [[Second Great Awakening]] in the early 19th century (under [[Charles Grandison Finney]], among others) emphasized personal piety, revivals, and devotion to civic duty. Theologically, [[Arminianism]] replaced the original [[Calvinism]]. [[Horace Bushnell]] introduced the idea of Christian nurture, through which children would be brought to religion without revivals.\n\n===Politics and reform===\nAfter 1800, Yankees spearheaded most reform movements, including those for abolition of slavery, temperance in use of alcohol, increase in women's political rights, and improvement in women's education. [[Emma Willard]] and [[Mary Lyon]] pioneered in the higher education of women, while Yankees comprised most of the reformers who went South during [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] in the late 1860s to educate the [[Freedman|Freedmen]].<ref>Taylor (1979)</ref>\n\nHistorian John Buenker has examined the worldview of the Yankee settlers in the Midwest:<blockquote>Because they arrived first and had a strong sense of community and mission, Yankees were able to transplant New England institutions, values, and mores, altered only by the conditions of frontier life.  They established a public culture that emphasized the work ethic, the sanctity of private property, individual responsibility, faith in residential and social mobility, practicality, piety, public order and decorum, reverence for public education, activists, honest, and frugal government, town meeting democracy, and he believed that there was a public interest that transcends particular and stock ambitions.  Regarding themselves as the elect and just in a world rife with sin and corruption, they felt a strong moral obligation to define and enforce standards of community and personal behavior\u2026.  This pietistic worldview was substantially shared by British, Scandinavian, Swiss, English-Canadian and Dutch Reformed immigrants, as well as by German Protestants and many of the Forty-Eighters.<ref>John Buenker, \"Wisconsin\" in {{cite book|last=James H. Madison, ed. |title=Heartland: Comparative Histories of the Midwestern States |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TMUCo0UXCjoC&pg=PA72|year=1988|publisher=Indiana University Press|pages=72\u201373|isbn=0253314232}}</ref></blockquote>Yankees dominated New England, much of [[upstate New York]], and much of the upper Midwest, and were the strongest supporters of the new Republican party in the 1860s. This was especially true for the [[Congregationalists]], [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]]s, and (after 1860) the Methodists among them. A study of 65 predominantly Yankee counties showed that they voted only 40% for the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]] in 1848 and 1852, but became 61\u201365% [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] in presidential elections of 1856 through 1864.<ref>Kleppner p 55</ref>\n\n[[Ivy League]] universities remained bastions of old Yankee culture until well after [[World War II]], particularly [[History of Harvard University|Harvard]] and [[Yale University|Yale]], as well as \"[[Little Ivies|Little Ivy]]\" [[liberal arts]] colleges.\n\n===Yankee stereotypes===\nPresident [[Calvin Coolidge]] exemplified the modern Yankee stereotype. Coolidge moved from rural [[Vermont]] to urban [[Massachusetts]] and was educated at elite [[Amherst College]]. Yet his flint-faced, unprepossessing ways and terse rural speech proved politically attractive. \"That Yankee twang will be worth a hundred thousand votes\", explained one Republican leader.<ref>William Allen White, ''A Puritan in Babylon: The Story of Calvin Coolidge'' (1938) p. 122.</ref> Coolidge's laconic ways and dry humor were characteristic of stereotypical rural \"Yankee humor\" at the turn of the 20th century.<ref>Arthur George Crandall, [https://books.google.com/books?id=AhXdAf0lBqwC&pg=PA13&dq=%22new+england+joke+lore%22 ''New England Joke Lore: The Tonic of Yankee Humor''], (F.A.

Traditionally, ''Yankee'' was most often used to refer to a New Englander descended from the original settlers of the region, thus often suggesting Puritanism and thrifty values.<ref>Bushman, (1967)</ref> By the mid-20th century, some speakers applied the word to any American inhabiting the area north of the [[Mason\u2013Dixon Line]], though usually with a specific focus still on New England.

They are also used in advertising, publicity, and for branding purposes. Police badges date back to medieval times when knights wore a coat of arms representing their allegiances and loyalty.\n\nBadges can be made from [[metal]], [[plastic]], [[leather]], [[textile]], [[natural rubber|rubber]], etc., and they are commonly attached to clothing, bags, [[footwear]], vehicles, home electrical equipment, etc. Textile badges or patches can be either woven or embroidered, and can be attached by gluing, ironing-on, sewing or applique.\n\nBadges have become highly collectable: in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], for example, the Badge Collectors' Circle has been in existence since 1980.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.badgecollectorscircle.co.uk/history#1980-1984 | title = The history of the Badge Collectors Circle | accessdate = 2011-08-02}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[military]], badges are used to denote the unit or arm to which the wearer belongs, and also qualifications received through military training, rank, etc. Similarly, youth organizations such as [[scouting]] and guiding use them to show group membership, awards and rank.\n[[File:Dima-rs1.jpg|thumb| Badge of the [[Germany|German]] ''[[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|Bundeskriminalamt]]'']]\n[[File:Dispositif_d%27une_\u00e9pingle_de_s\u00fbret\u00e9_sur_une_\u00e9pinglette.JPG|thumb|back of a badge, with [[safety pin]] attachment]]\n==History==\nBadges were popular as jewellery in the [[Middle Ages]], and varied from extremely expensive works of jewellery, like the [[Dunstable Swan Jewel]], to simple mold-made badges in lead or other base metals. Specialized forms were the [[pilgrim badge]], worn by those who had completed a [[pilgrimage]], and [[heraldic badge|heraldic]] or [[livery badges]], worn to denote service or allegiance to a political figure \u2014 these last were especially popular in England, and became very controversial in the period leading up to the [[Wars of the Roses]].  One royal celebration in 1483 was marked by the distribution of 13,000 badges, a huge number relative to the population at the time.  Other types were funerary badges, presumably presented to mourners for the funeral of important figures, and simple decorative badges with animals or hearts.  The grandest form of badge was worn as a pendant to a metal collar, often in gold or [[silver-gilt]]. \n\nFrom the livery badge, various badges of service evolved, worn by officials, soldiers and servants. In the [[British Army]] a metal (today often plastic) [[cap badge]] denoting the soldier's [[regiment]] became standard by the 17th century, as in most European armies (though not always navies).  By the 19th century a badge was an almost invariable part of any [[uniform]], including [[school uniform]]s, which in the UK usually still feature the school's badge in cloth on the breast pocket of the jacket or [[blazer]].\n\n==Various uses==\nOne of the best-known badges is the typically star-shaped [[Sheriffs in the United States|U.S. sheriff]]'s badge, made famous in [[Western (genre)|Westerns]]. The [[Chairman Mao badge]] is probably the most famous political badge. Members of [[fraternities]] and [[sororities]] often refer to the pins that signify their membership as badges.\n\n[[File:A Badge Pinning.jpg|thumb|Badge pinning]]\n\nThe [[BBC]] children's programme [[Blue Peter]] also awards its own \"[[Blue Peter badge]]\" to members of the public who appear on the show. These are highly collectable as they cannot be bought\u2014except from people who have been awarded one and wish to sell it.\n\nCase badges are thick, about {{convert|3|mm|abbr=on}} deep, {{convert|3|x|3|cm|adj=on}} [[lucite]] stickers that are often packaged with various computer parts, such as processors and video cards. Modern computer cases are frequently embellished with an indentation on the case's front panel to facilitate the affixing of a case badge. \n\nButton badges are a highly collectible round badge with a plastic coating over a design or image. They often have a metal pin back or a safety pin style back. The most popular size is {{convert|25.4|mm|adj=on}} but the badges can range anywhere from this size right up to {{convert|120|mm|adj=on}} badges. This style of badge is used in [[political campaigning]] and often given as part of a birthday greeting such as a [[birthday card]].\n\nIn the United States, the badges used by [[law enforcement]], [[Fire guard|fire]], and [[security guards]] are usually made of metal in various colors and finishes and are worn above the left chest pocket on the uniform shirt or jacket. [[File:Greenville, North Carolina Police Badge.jpg|thumb|left|Police Badge, Greenville, North Carolina, presented to the Mayor, [[William J. Hadden]]]] [[Detective]]s and other [[Undercover|plainclothes personnel]] may wear them on a belt holder, or on a chain around the neck. Shapes are manifold, with [[municipal]] [[police]] departments tending to have some variation of a shield shape, and sheriff's departments usually going with a 5, 6, or 7 point star shape. In most cases, an enameled seal of the organization, city, county, or company can be found in the center of the badge.\n\nIn [[computing]], badges are used to demonstrate skills.<ref>[https://wiki.mozilla.org/Badges Mozilla Open Badges Project]</ref> In education, [[digital badges]] are used as alternative forms of credentials, similar to those being used in the MacArthur Foundation's Badges for Lifelong Learning initiative.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://hastac.org/competitions  | title = Badges for Lifelong Learning | accessdate = 2012-11-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url =http://dmlcompetition.net/Competition/4/badges-about.php  | title = About the Badges for Lifelong Learning initiative | accessdate = 2012-11-20}}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Attwood, Philip, [https://www.worldcat.org/title/badges/oclc/249149884 Badges].

They are also used in advertising, publicity, and for branding purposes. Police badges date back to medieval times when knights wore a coat of arms representing their allegiances and loyalty.\n\nBadges can be made from [[metal]], [[plastic]], [[leather]], [[textile]], [[natural rubber|rubber]], etc., and they are commonly attached to clothing, bags, [[footwear]], vehicles, home electrical equipment, etc. Textile badges or patches can be either woven or embroidered, and can be attached by gluing, ironing-on, sewing or applique.\n\nBadges have become highly collectable: in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], for example, the Badge Collectors' Circle has been in existence since 1980.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.badgecollectorscircle.co.uk/history#1980-1984 | title = The history of the Badge Collectors Circle | accessdate = 2011-08-02}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[military]], badges are used to denote the unit or arm to which the wearer belongs, and also qualifications received through military training, rank, etc. Similarly, youth organizations such as [[scouting]] and guiding use them to show group membership, awards and rank.\n[[File:Dima-rs1.jpg|thumb| Badge of the [[Germany|German]] ''[[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|Bundeskriminalamt]]'']]\n[[File:Dispositif_d%27une_\u00e9pingle_de_s\u00fbret\u00e9_sur_une_\u00e9pinglette.JPG|thumb|back of a badge, with [[safety pin]] attachment]]\n==History==\nBadges were popular as jewellery in the [[Middle Ages]], and varied from extremely expensive works of jewellery, like the [[Dunstable Swan Jewel]], to simple mold-made badges in lead or other base metals. Specialized forms were the [[pilgrim badge]], worn by those who had completed a [[pilgrimage]], and [[heraldic badge|heraldic]] or [[livery badges]], worn to denote service or allegiance to a political figure \u2014 these last were especially popular in England, and became very controversial in the period leading up to the [[Wars of the Roses]].  One royal celebration in 1483 was marked by the distribution of 13,000 badges, a huge number relative to the population at the time.  Other types were funerary badges, presumably presented to mourners for the funeral of important figures, and simple decorative badges with animals or hearts.  The grandest form of badge was worn as a pendant to a metal collar, often in gold or [[silver-gilt]]. \n\nFrom the livery badge, various badges of service evolved, worn by officials, soldiers and servants. In the [[British Army]] a metal (today often plastic) [[cap badge]] denoting the soldier's [[regiment]] became standard by the 17th century, as in most European armies (though not always navies).  By the 19th century a badge was an almost invariable part of any [[uniform]], including [[school uniform]]s, which in the UK usually still feature the school's badge in cloth on the breast pocket of the jacket or [[blazer]].\n\n==Various uses==\nOne of the best-known badges is the typically star-shaped [[Sheriffs in the United States|U.S. sheriff]]'s badge, made famous in [[Western (genre)|Westerns]]. The [[Chairman Mao badge]] is probably the most famous political badge. Members of [[fraternities]] and [[sororities]] often refer to the pins that signify their membership as badges.\n\n[[File:A Badge Pinning.jpg|thumb|Badge pinning]]\n\nThe [[BBC]] children's programme [[Blue Peter]] also awards its own \"[[Blue Peter badge]]\" to members of the public who appear on the show. These are highly collectable as they cannot be bought\u2014except from people who have been awarded one and wish to sell it.\n\nCase badges are thick, about {{convert|3|mm|abbr=on}} deep, {{convert|3|x|3|cm|adj=on}} [[lucite]] stickers that are often packaged with various computer parts, such as processors and video cards. Modern computer cases are frequently embellished with an indentation on the case's front panel to facilitate the affixing of a case badge. \n\nButton badges are a highly collectible round badge with a plastic coating over a design or image. They often have a metal pin back or a safety pin style back. The most popular size is {{convert|25.4|mm|adj=on}} but the badges can range anywhere from this size right up to {{convert|120|mm|adj=on}} badges. This style of badge is used in [[political campaigning]] and often given as part of a birthday greeting such as a [[birthday card]].\n\nIn the United States, the badges used by [[law enforcement]], [[Fire guard|fire]], and [[security guards]] are usually made of metal in various colors and finishes and are worn above the left chest pocket on the uniform shirt or jacket. [[File:Greenville, North Carolina Police Badge.jpg|thumb|left|Police Badge, Greenville, North Carolina, presented to the Mayor, [[William J. Hadden]]]] [[Detective]]s and other [[Undercover|plainclothes personnel]] may wear them on a belt holder, or on a chain around the neck. Shapes are manifold, with [[municipal]] [[police]] departments tending to have some variation of a shield shape, and sheriff's departments usually going with a 5, 6, or 7 point star shape. In most cases, an enameled seal of the organization, city, county, or company can be found in the center of the badge.\n\nIn [[computing]], badges are used to demonstrate skills.<ref>[https://wiki.mozilla.org/Badges Mozilla Open Badges Project]</ref> In education, [[digital badges]] are used as alternative forms of credentials, similar to those being used in the MacArthur Foundation's Badges for Lifelong Learning initiative.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://hastac.org/competitions  | title = Badges for Lifelong Learning | accessdate = 2012-11-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url =http://dmlcompetition.net/Competition/4/badges-about.php  | title = About the Badges for Lifelong Learning initiative | accessdate = 2012-11-20}}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Attwood, Philip, [https://www.worldcat.org/title/badges/oclc/249149884 Badges].

According to the New York Times, NATO forces would most likely have a minimal battlefield role, with the exception of some special operations advisers.<ref name=\"NYT20121126\" />\n\nAn important question for the NATO mission after 2014 was what level of the Afghan military hierarchy they would advise. It was generally expected that they would advise seven regional Afghan Army corps and several regional Afghan police headquarters. The arrangement would largely insulate the NATO advisers from the battlefield, though officials said advisers might accompany Afghan brigades on major operations. It was unlikely that NATO officers would advise Afghan battalions on the battlefield, because that would require many more advisers than NATO was likely to muster and would entail more risk than most nations seem prepared to assume, though some American experts believed it would make the Afghan military more effective. Still, NATO special operations advisers would be likely to accompany Afghan Army commandos and police SWAT-type units on the battlefield.<ref name=\"NYT20121126\" />\n\nA major challenge was that Afghanistan would not have an effective air force before 2017, if then.  As a consequence American officials said that NATO airpower would remain in Afghanistan after 2014 but will likely only be used on behalf of NATO and American troops and perhaps Afghan units that are accompanied by NATO advisers. NATO forces relied heavily on airpower for airstrikes, supply and medical evacuation since Afghanistan's roads are in poor condition and often seeded with bombs. To compensate for Afghanistan's limited airpower, the United States was working on a number of fixes, including providing Afghan forces with armored vehicles that would be equipped with mortars and assault guns. The United States was looking into expanding the purchase of turboprop planes for the Afghans. In addition the U.S. was also trying to help Afghan pilots learn to fly at night.<ref name=\"NYT20121126\" /> Equally troubling was according to the New York Times the problem of medical evacuations. Because after 2014 the Afghans would almost certainly need to rely on a system that depended more on ground transportation than helicopters the United States wanted to help Afghanistan forces develop more field hospitals.<ref name=\"NYT20121126\" />\n\nPlans for the follow-on military presence are being formulated in the Pentagon, where the largest of several preliminary options calls for about 10,000 troops, with several other NATO governments penciled in for several hundred each. According to these preliminary plans, ISAF's successor would be based in Kabul, with most U.S. training and counterterrorism troops probably stationed in Kandahar and at the air base at Bagram. Both locations are to be converted to Afghan ownership. Smaller counterterrorism units of the [[Joint Special Operations Command]] would be positioned primarily in the eastern part of the country, where most of their activities take place. Italy, in charge of the ISAF mission in Herat in western Afghanistan, would remain there to train Afghans. Germany would do the same in Mazar-e Sharif in the north. It is unclear what would happen at Camp Bastion, the British headquarters in Helmand province.<ref name=\"WP20121205\">{{cite news|last=DeYoung|first=Karen|title=U.S. reducing plans for large civilian force in post-2014 Afghanistan|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-reducing-plans-for-large-civilian-force-in-post-2014-afghanistan/2012/12/05/67c7d9a8-380f-11e2-8a97-363b0f9a0ab3_story.html|accessdate=5 December 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=5 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe size of the American military presence after 2014 will help determine the size of the American civilian footprint.

As of February 2020 about 13,000 American troops were still in the country. The two sides agreed a gradual, conditions-based withdrawal over 14 months and the withdrawal agreement encompasses \"all military forces of the United States, its allies, and Coalition partners, including all non-diplomatic civilian personnel, private security contractors, trainers, advisors, and supporting services personnel.\". In the first phase the U.S. will initially reduce its forces in Afghanistan by about 5,000 troops to 8,600 within 135 days of the U.S.-Taliban agreement. During the gradual withdrawal, the Taliban and the Afghan government would have to work out a more concrete power-sharing settlement. That time frame would give the government the cover of American military protection while negotiating. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the remaining U.S. troops will serve as leverage to ensure the Taliban lives up to its promises. If the Taliban fulfills its commitments to renounce al Qaeda and begin [[Afghan peace process|intra-Afghan peace talks]], the U.S. agreed to a complete withdrawal of all remaining American forces from Afghanistan within 10 months.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Hamid Shalizi |author2=Charlotte Greenfield |title=U.S. to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 14 months if Taliban conditions met

According to the New York Times, NATO forces would most likely have a minimal battlefield role, with the exception of some special operations advisers.<ref name=\"NYT20121126\" />\n\nAn important question for the NATO mission after 2014 was what level of the Afghan military hierarchy they would advise. It was generally expected that they would advise seven regional Afghan Army corps and several regional Afghan police headquarters. The arrangement would largely insulate the NATO advisers from the battlefield, though officials said advisers might accompany Afghan brigades on major operations. It was unlikely that NATO officers would advise Afghan battalions on the battlefield, because that would require many more advisers than NATO was likely to muster and would entail more risk than most nations seem prepared to assume, though some American experts believed it would make the Afghan military more effective. Still, NATO special operations advisers would be likely to accompany Afghan Army commandos and police SWAT-type units on the battlefield.<ref name=\"NYT20121126\" />\n\nA major challenge was that Afghanistan would not have an effective air force before 2017, if then.  As a consequence American officials said that NATO airpower would remain in Afghanistan after 2014 but will likely only be used on behalf of NATO and American troops and perhaps Afghan units that are accompanied by NATO advisers. NATO forces relied heavily on airpower for airstrikes, supply and medical evacuation since Afghanistan's roads are in poor condition and often seeded with bombs. To compensate for Afghanistan's limited airpower, the United States was working on a number of fixes, including providing Afghan forces with armored vehicles that would be equipped with mortars and assault guns. The United States was looking into expanding the purchase of turboprop planes for the Afghans. In addition the U.S. was also trying to help Afghan pilots learn to fly at night.<ref name=\"NYT20121126\" /> Equally troubling was according to the New York Times the problem of medical evacuations. Because after 2014 the Afghans would almost certainly need to rely on a system that depended more on ground transportation than helicopters the United States wanted to help Afghanistan forces develop more field hospitals.<ref name=\"NYT20121126\" />\n\nPlans for the follow-on military presence are being formulated in the Pentagon, where the largest of several preliminary options calls for about 10,000 troops, with several other NATO governments penciled in for several hundred each. According to these preliminary plans, ISAF's successor would be based in Kabul, with most U.S. training and counterterrorism troops probably stationed in Kandahar and at the air base at Bagram. Both locations are to be converted to Afghan ownership. Smaller counterterrorism units of the [[Joint Special Operations Command]] would be positioned primarily in the eastern part of the country, where most of their activities take place. Italy, in charge of the ISAF mission in Herat in western Afghanistan, would remain there to train Afghans. Germany would do the same in Mazar-e Sharif in the north. It is unclear what would happen at Camp Bastion, the British headquarters in Helmand province.<ref name=\"WP20121205\">{{cite news|last=DeYoung|first=Karen|title=U.S. reducing plans for large civilian force in post-2014 Afghanistan|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-reducing-plans-for-large-civilian-force-in-post-2014-afghanistan/2012/12/05/67c7d9a8-380f-11e2-8a97-363b0f9a0ab3_story.html|accessdate=5 December 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=5 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe size of the American military presence after 2014 will help determine the size of the American civilian footprint.
